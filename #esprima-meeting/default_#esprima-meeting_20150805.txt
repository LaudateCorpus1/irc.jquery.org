[11:01:23] <ariya> good morning/afternoon/evening everyone!
[11:04:10] <ariya> I'll be taking notes again
[11:04:12] <ariya> let's start
[11:04:24] <ariya> since last time
[11:04:29] <ariya> 2.5 was out last Friday
[11:04:50] <ariya> also https://www.npmjs.com/package/esprima indicates that the downloads now exceed 8M last month
[11:04:57] <gibson042> with full ES6 support, right?
[11:05:11] <ariya> feature complete
[11:05:14] <gibson042> or ES2015, even
[11:05:17] <gibson042> woo!
[11:05:25] <ariya> it may have defects, or incomplete early error handling
[11:05:52] <gibson042> right, our support at this point is representation of any valid program
[11:06:20] <ariya> we continue to focus on polishes for 2.6
[11:06:31] <ariya> the new unified test runner from jlast has been landed
[11:07:02] <ariya> I already found an issue with Firefox 39: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1271
[11:07:08] <ariya> more like our problem, not Firefox's problem
[11:07:15] <jlast> hey guys
[11:07:27] <ariya> morning jlast
[11:07:37] <jlast> looking at 1271
[11:07:53] <ariya> jlast: excellent :-)
[11:08:09] <jlast> oh interesting. this is a really nice argument for saucelabs
[11:08:12] <ariya> probably just require another special handling, i.e. ignoring value check for a regex
[11:08:26] <ariya> true
[11:08:45] <ariya> there's a couple of other bugs that I'll be working on
[11:09:02] <ariya> And I really want to replace coveralls with codecov.io
[11:10:01] <ariya> jlast: if you got that fix, I want to put it https://github.com/litixsoft/karma-detect-browsers
[11:10:14] <ariya> works well in my WIP setup
[11:10:59] <jlast> cool
[11:11:29] <jlast> ariya, not sure if it's a priority now, but could you sketch out how you see https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1176 looking
[11:12:30] <ariya> well now that you bring that up :-)
[11:12:45] <ariya> here's a controversial idea: post 2.6, I'm thinking of switching the code base to TypeScript
[11:13:07] <ariya> I have an experimental branch that I can publish in a week or two (just to clean-up embarassing notes here and there)
[11:13:18] <ariya> it goes a long way in increasing the modularity and readability
[11:13:21] <jlast> haha - that could be interesting
[11:13:38] <jlast> i could see that helping readability a lot
[11:15:05] <ariya> and refactoring and things like that
[11:15:33] <ariya> per our usual tradition, nothing will regress if we make that switch
[11:15:46] <jlast> sounds good.
[11:16:00] <ariya> we will keep the high standard for complexity, coverage, test suite, etc
[11:16:10] <jlast> I plan on looking into the https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1048 this week
[11:16:37] <ariya> jlast: please do, let me know if you need some help
[11:16:52] <ariya> and I think https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1270 looks good, I'll merge it later today
[11:17:03] <jlast> sure, I'll share questions on the issue
[11:17:10] <ariya> we'll probably not pursue https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1243 further
[11:17:22] <ariya> per my comment on https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1210
[11:18:02] <jlast> agreed. i'll close the PR. they're linked anyways
[11:18:35] <ariya> I think we'll have an even more polished Esprima in 2.6 :-)
[11:18:53] <jlast> what are the goals for 2.6?
[11:19:06] <ariya> squash all those bugs + more tests
[11:19:38] <jlast> cool - i can take a look at issues once there's a milestone https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.5+is%3Aclosed
[11:19:54] <ariya> jlast: good point, let me create the milestone
[11:20:11] <ariya> as I verify our ES6 support, I also start to file issues on Espree (just to be a good citizen)
[11:20:15] <ariya> https://github.com/eslint/espree/issues
[11:20:34] <ariya> unfortunately my time is rather limited in contributing back our fixes there
[11:23:05] <ariya> oh BTW, the use of TypeScript means we can start using many ES6 features as well
[11:23:48] <ariya> that's all I have from my side
[11:23:54] <ariya> anybody wants to discuss any other topics?
[11:25:14] <gibson042> I've got nothing new for here
[11:25:19] <jlast> just reading https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1256
[11:25:48] <ariya> gibson042: have you put some thought into the project I have proposed? :-)
[11:26:13] <gibson042> yes; expect a response this week
[11:26:22] <ariya> sweet
[11:26:24] * ariya is thrilled
[11:26:52] <ariya> I think that's all for this week
[11:27:00] <ariya> thank you everyone for your participation!
[11:27:04] <ariya> see you again next Wed!
[11:27:05] * ariya waves
