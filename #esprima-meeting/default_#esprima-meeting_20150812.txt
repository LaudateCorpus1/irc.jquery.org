[11:00:51] <jlast> Hello
[11:03:37] <ariya> hola everyone!
[11:04:24] <jlast> hola
[11:05:11] <ariya> is mikesherov around?
[11:05:18] <ariya> if not, I'm taking the minutes again
[11:05:42] <ariya> let's get started
[11:05:46] <ariya> "since last time"
[11:05:50] <ariya> mostly test infrastructure
[11:06:55] <ariya> unified runner: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1258 thanks to jlast
[11:06:59] <ariya> browser auto-detect: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1275
[11:07:05] <ariya> regex test fix: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1271
[11:07:11] <ariya> "progress on 2.6"
[11:07:29] <ariya> jlast: I finally had an idea for https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1256 last weekend
[11:07:34] <ariya> let's just "patch" the existing tree
[11:07:50] <jlast> what do you mean?
[11:07:57] <ariya> I'll try to run this again today and see where I end up with: https://gist.github.com/ariya/c449ef628f8ff5dd0af5
[11:08:38] <ariya> find test/fixtures/ -name '*.json' -execdir node ~patch-source-type.js {} \;
[11:08:57] <gibson042> sorry I'm late
[11:09:03] <ariya> hi gibson042
[11:09:04] <ariya> no probs
[11:09:11] <jlast> cool. i like it
[11:09:22] <ariya> that way, we're not blocked by https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1272
[11:09:27] <ariya> aka 1272 can be worked in parallel
[11:09:45] <ariya> your PR https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1279 looks good, I should be able to merge it later today
[11:10:38] <jlast> good. yea, it was driving me nuts. especially when i saw it repro'd on firefox and safari
[11:11:10] <jlast> i began looking into https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1048 as well
[11:11:18] <jlast> here's a diff of an updated test https://gist.github.com/jasonLaster/75c9f8704530184ba12b
[11:11:28] <ariya> I haven't looked at any bug yet
[11:12:38] <ariya> hopefully I'll pick or two
[11:13:13] <jlast> if you find a good bite sized one, feel free to mention me on the issue
[11:13:42] <jlast> I should have more time over the next couple weeks than i did over the past couple
[11:13:57] <ariya> jlast: I think https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1006 fits that requirement
[11:14:14] <ariya> you just need to modify estree first, accordingly
[11:14:46] <jlast> i'll take a look at that again.
[11:15:49] <ariya> last important subject: "near future refactoring"
[11:16:04] <ariya> here's my typescript branch for your amusement
[11:16:05] <ariya> https://github.com/ariya/esprima/tree/typescript
[11:16:53] <ariya> I am biased, but I think the code looks cleaner :-)
[11:17:28] <ariya> there's a known 13% perf regression because not everything is global anymore, but I think we can live with that (and possible improve it)
[11:17:31] <jlast> having a `src` folder is a huge win. I'll review this week
[11:18:45] <ariya> beware if you check out the branch cause I keep rebasing it on top of latest master
[11:19:00] <ariya> the refactoring itself is not complete due to various complication and time constraint
[11:19:26] <ariya> e.g. I hate to keep the strict state in the scanner but removing that requires a bigger surgery than what I can afford right now
[11:20:11] <ariya> obviously no ES6 let and const yet
[11:20:23] <ariya> and types for function parameters are only in the scanner so far
[11:21:23] <jlast> it looks nice. really glad you kept the package.json uptodoate so it's easy to test/compile/run
[11:21:52] <ariya> yeah from dev perspective, there's really regression
[11:21:58] <ariya> beside that minor perf hit
[11:23:20] <ariya> unrelated note: seems that the next webpack will understand ES6 a bit
[11:23:22] <ariya> thanks to esprima dep bump: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/commit/9d88adaf
[11:24:33] <ariya> I am a bit hesitant to create an issue on the typescript switch
[11:24:58] <ariya> My fear is it will be flooded with "why TypeScript and not X?"
[11:25:05] <ariya> what's the best trade off for this?
[11:25:43] <jlast> Is there already a refactor ticket?
[11:26:13] <jlast> if not, maybe create one with the goals. TypeScript is more of a solution to a problem than an issue itslef in my mind
[11:26:16] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1176
[11:26:20] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1177
[11:26:40] <ariya> jlast: good idea, we can portray the use TS to address "use more ES6"
[11:28:17] <jlast> I think that's reasonable
[11:28:40] <ariya> excellent suggestion thanks
[11:28:47] <ariya> meanwhile, that's all I have for this week
[11:28:53] <ariya> anything else we should discuss?
[11:31:13] <jlast> see you next week
[11:31:51] <ariya> thank you everyone
[11:31:54] <ariya> bye bye
[11:31:55] * ariya waves
