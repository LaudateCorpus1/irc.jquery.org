[14:01:52] <ariya> good morning/afternoon/evening!
[14:02:46] <ariya> we didn't have an online meeting last week cause I was at Velocity
[14:02:51] <ariya> I forgot to give a heads-up
[14:03:08] <ariya> on the other hand, jlast and I met and had a pairing session!
[14:03:20] <jlast> hello
[14:03:28] <ariya> hi jlast
[14:03:33] <ariya> so let's get started
[14:03:35] <jlast> yea, that was pretty great
[14:03:41] <ariya> 2.7 release is imminent!
[14:03:57] <ariya> I just need to tag it tomorrow morning, npm publish, and update the site
[14:04:07] <ariya> today is Back to the Future day
[14:04:13] <ariya> but tomorrow is also important
[14:04:18] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/commit/c1c811d46f98b4f35339998418074b2edeb82f51
[14:04:29] <ariya> 3 years ago, Esprima 1.0 was officially sanctioned :-)
[14:05:16] <ariya> we're luck that the project is alive
[14:05:28] <ariya> many FOSS projects die after the first year of its existence
[14:06:40] <ariya> now that token delegate is in 2.7, it's time to build a syntax highlighting plugin
[14:06:48] <ariya> jlast: you want to give it a try for ST plugin?
[14:07:04] <jlast> sorry, in a meeting
[14:07:07] <ariya> meanwhile, I'm stuck with vim so I probably need to learn how to write a vim plugin for this
[14:08:25] <ariya> np
[14:09:08] <ariya> with 2.7 I think it's time to switch master to the new 3.x series
[14:09:15] <ariya> with modularization, TypeScript, and all that jazz
[14:09:29] <ariya> I'll send a heads-up email to the mailing list regarding this change
[14:12:36] <ariya> last but not least, there's Fluent 2016 in SF
[14:12:46] <ariya> among others, jlast and I will have a talk
[14:12:53] <ariya> I think some Shapers are going to hang out there as well
[14:13:01] <ariya> probably a good opportunity to meet and greet
[14:15:26] <ariya> I think that's all the updates I have
[14:15:38] <ariya> let's get excited with the new chapter of Esprima 3.x :-)
[14:15:43] <ariya> stay tuned for more info
[14:15:51] <ariya> thanks and see you again next week
