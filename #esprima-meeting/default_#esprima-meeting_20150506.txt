[11:01:42] <mikesherov> Hi!
[11:01:58] <mikesherov> gibson042: ikarienator
[11:02:05] <gibson042> good day
[11:02:38] <mikesherov> anyone hear from ariya or jeffmo?
[11:08:15] <ariya> hola
[11:09:01] <ariya> sorry for the delay
[11:09:05] <ariya> everyone is ready?
[11:09:12] <ariya> mikesherov: ikarienator: gibson042 ?
[11:09:29] <gibson042> yes; ready
[11:11:02] <ariya> is mikesherov around? otherwise, I can take notes
[11:12:37] <gibson042> he was _just_ here
[11:13:23] <ariya> let me just start it
[11:13:28] <ariya> so what happens since last week?
[11:13:35] <ariya> I closed PR related to harmony branch
[11:13:57] <ariya> I still need to look for issues and determine if each pertains only harmony branch or not
[11:14:01] <gibson042> nothing at all for me; stuff blew up at work :\
[11:14:12] <ariya> the harmony branch's content is now gone, I left a message in the README
[11:14:16] <mikesherov> great
[11:14:23] <ariya> gibson042: do you need some help with the for of?
[11:14:24] <mikesherov> I sent a draft of the CST email to everyone
[11:14:55] <ariya> mikesherov: just got that, thanks a lot
[11:15:54] <gibson042> depends on the timing we want... it doesn't look like I'll be able to pick it up again until Sunday/Monday
[11:17:06] <ariya> also I got the green light to finish the generator, will need 2-3 days to come up with a PR
[11:18:16] <ariya> other than that, nothing much from my side
[11:19:03] <ariya> spring/summer is beautiful, and the weekends are gone with family hiking and such :-)
[11:19:25] <mikesherov> agreed
[11:20:52] <ariya> my goal this week: complete the generator impl
[11:22:19] <ariya> mikesherov: I'll find my note on the talk proposal and send it over to you for feedback
[11:22:30] <ariya> do we have any other topics warrant a discussion?
[11:22:57] <mikesherov> I do want to discuss plugin feature flags
[11:23:06] <ariya> sure
[11:23:09] <mikesherov> but willing to wait till we can get nzakas jeffmo here
[11:23:29] <mikesherov> Besides, once generators are in, we'll have a clearer picture
[11:23:50] <ariya> we also need to worry about early errors
[11:24:47] <michaelficarra> we should consider porting the Shift test suite over so we can see which features fail the most tests
[11:25:18] <ariya> michaelficarra: porting to ?
[11:30:16] <michaelficarra> esprima's test suite
[11:30:27] <ariya> ah I see
[11:30:36] <ariya> you want to compare the success vs failures
[11:31:03] <michaelficarra> I think it could help plan the roadmap if we see the number of failing tests per feature
[11:31:39] <ariya> michaelficarra: noted
[11:31:55] <ariya> mikesherov: ikarienator: gibson042: michaelficarra: any other topics?
[11:33:22] <gibson042> feature flags are waiting for nzakas and jeffmo?
[11:33:49] <ariya> that is right
[11:34:01] <ariya> nzakas for eslint input, jeffmo for react/jsx
[11:34:16] <gibson042> got it
[11:34:21] <gibson042> nothing more from me
[11:34:29] <ariya> sounds good
[11:36:44] <ariya> I think that's all for today
[11:36:52] <ariya> thank you very much everyone
[11:37:01] <ariya> see you next week and hopefully with more stuff to discuss!
