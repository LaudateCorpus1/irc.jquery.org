[11:04:20] <ariya> hola!
[11:04:48] <jlast> hola
[11:04:49] <gibson042> I'm here (for now), but mobile and in between meetings
[11:05:29] <gibson042> <3 4G, though
[11:05:44] <ariya> let's get started jlast and gibson042
[11:05:52] <ariya> since last week
[11:06:05] <ariya> I was busy integrating all CI services on the planet :-)
[11:06:11] <ariya> Circle CI to run code coverage tracking + downstream tests
[11:06:16] <ariya> AppVeyor for Windows testing (including IE 11)
[11:06:21] <ariya> Full explanation: http://esprima.org/test/ci.html
[11:06:37] <ariya> if the text is confusing/misleading, just create a PR to the gh-pages branch
[11:07:26] <ariya> at this stage, what's missing is Sauce Labs for cross-browser tests
[11:07:38] <ariya> after that, we are as good as we could get :-)
[11:08:05] <jlast> AppVeyor is cool
[11:08:31] <ariya> yup
[11:08:47] <ariya> I want to try some nuget/chocolatey magic so we can install the latest chrome and firefox
[11:09:00] <ariya> that way AppVeyor will cover our IE11, Chrome, Firefox in one go
[11:09:06] <jlast> sure
[11:09:34] <ariya> and Node.js/io.js on Windows of course (which many projects surprisingly ignore)
[11:09:58] <ariya> next topic: progress on 2.6
[11:10:18] <ariya> I have scheduled it for next week, see also for the tracking https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1308
[11:10:28] <ariya> jlast: are you trying to get that test runner some time soon?
[11:10:42] <jlast> ariya, going to share a PR in a couple minutes
[11:10:51] <ariya> wonderful
[11:11:01] <jlast> i put something together last night. it's minimal, but should be easy to iterate
[11:11:05] <ariya> also, what do you folks think about badges? that seems to be quite popular these days
[11:11:14] <ariya> but we don't want to give the impression of showing off
[11:11:18] <ariya> https://github.com/ariya/esprima/blob/badges/README.md
[11:12:05] <jlast> I think some badges like coverage and tests are good
[11:12:13] <jlast> downloads seems unecessary
[11:12:35] <ariya> ironically downloads is the one that is changing
[11:12:37] <jlast> are you thinking of adding more badges
[11:12:48] <ariya> since we strive to maintain passing build and 100% coverage all the time
[11:13:13] <ariya> jlast: beyond the 4 badges in that link, I can't think of anything more useful
[11:15:01] <ariya> also I plan to finalize my long PR https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1302
[11:15:17] <ariya> that'll fix the unfortunate bug with for statement https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1301
[11:16:00] <ariya> after 2.6, let me rebase my typescript branch for more review + discussion
[11:16:56] <ariya> last topic: misc
[11:17:01] <ariya> the website is outdated
[11:17:12] <ariya> if someone feels like volunteering for a face lift, be my guest :-)
[11:20:31] <jlast> ariya, I was looking at it yesterday briefly
[11:20:45] <jlast> happy to do a couple small steps
[11:20:56] <ariya> right on :-)
[11:20:59] <jlast> Maybe make an issue with some thoughts and we can chat there
[11:21:03] <ariya> sure
[11:21:15] <ariya> I can imagine backbone-ifying some parts will be a good start
[11:21:29] <ariya> it's a messy and hairy vanilla JS all over the place
[11:21:36] <ariya> back when I didn't know better :-(
[11:21:40] <jlast> sure. There are lots of examples
[11:22:04] <jlast> I could see the homepage being cleaned up. Just typography, layout stuff
[11:22:18] <ariya> yup, seems that most want the parser demo anyway
[11:22:26] <ariya> might as well make it prominent in the landing page
[11:22:35] <jlast> yea, that'd be pretty cool actually
[11:22:55] <jlast> could even be a fun "educational" opportunity
[11:23:05] <ariya> the tree widget is outdated, YUI-based
[11:23:13] <jlast> haha - i saw that :P
[11:23:17] <ariya> it works, but I'm not sure that's what the cool kids these days are using
[11:23:38] * ariya outted himself as a YUI fanboy
[11:23:42] <jlast> yea, i dropped in JSON Editor for the runner, but that's because i have experience w/ the API
[11:24:36] <ariya> feel free to start some tickets and continue the brainstorming/ideas
[11:24:39] <ariya> I'm all ears :-)
[11:25:30] <ariya> any other topic we shall discuss?
[11:30:44] <ariya> I think that's it for this week
[11:30:52] <ariya> thank you very much and see you again next Wednesday!
[11:30:54] * ariya waves
