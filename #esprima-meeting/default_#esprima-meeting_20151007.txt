[14:01:50] <jlast> hello
[14:03:59] <gibson042> hello
[14:05:58] <ariya> hello everyone!
[14:08:14] * ariya is taking some notes
[14:08:18] <ariya> let's get started
[14:09:08] <ariya> "orphaned" comments are now part of innerComments: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1331
[14:09:20] <ariya> I also solved another bound identifier with let
[14:09:24] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1337
[14:09:40] <ariya> it felt special, after that 1337 reference :-)
[14:10:05] <ariya> 2.7 is being delayed
[14:10:17] <ariya> particularly since I still don't have a final idea on how to test token delegate
[14:10:25] <ariya> though the experimental branch is at token delegate experiment: https://github.com/ariya/esprima/tree/token-delegate
[14:13:55] <ariya> last but not least: I'll be in NY this Tue-Wed
[14:14:08] <ariya> jlast: mikesherov_: if you want to meet and chat, seems that Tue is an option
[14:14:27] <ariya> I'll give the first keynote talk and it's on Tue morning
[14:14:35] <ariya> so I'll be a bit relaxed after that
[14:15:32] <jlast> I could probably meet sometime after launch
[14:15:38] <jlast> haha lunch
[14:16:18] <jlast> maybe send an email to the two of us so we can set a time and location?
[14:16:20] <ariya> do you want to come over or should I find Etsy office? :-)
[14:16:40] <jlast> either is fine. happy to host
[14:17:30] <jlast> what's the address?
[14:17:42] <ariya> I can have another excuse to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge again
[14:18:02] <ariya> New York Hilton Midtown
[14:18:07] <jlast> haha absolutely
[14:18:45] <ariya> close to Universal Studio
[14:18:51] <ariya> between Times Square and Central Park
[14:19:22] <jlast> yea, actually it's right on the F. so it'd be easy to meet either way
[14:19:40] <jlast> so, i was playing with the typescript branch
[14:19:53] <jlast> and it looks like two files are not formatted:
[14:20:03] <jlast> parser.ts, scanner.ts
[14:20:07] <ariya> let's play by the ear, I might be able to convince a friend to visit Etsy as well
[14:20:15] <ariya> oh that's good
[14:20:32] <jlast> sure
[14:21:03] <ariya> we only run tsfmt --verify src/*.ts
[14:21:12] <ariya> from `npm run jlast code-style`
[14:21:38] <ariya> probably a good idea to have another npm run, to run tsfmt without --verify
[14:21:40] <jlast> oh actually, looks like tsfmt might not be installed
[14:21:45] <ariya> hence it will automatically reformat it
[14:21:56] <ariya> the package is called typescript-formatter
[14:22:12] <ariya> https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-formatter
[14:22:30] <ariya> I probably need to update a bunch of deps
[14:22:40] <jlast> still seeing that - https://gist.github.com/82ac5e5807f450bdb62e
[14:22:43] <ariya> there are new packages all over the places, after TS 1.5 release
[14:22:54] <jlast> oh sure. that could be it too
[14:24:03] <ariya> I'll update my typescript this evening
[14:24:11] <ariya> thanks for catching it :-)
[14:24:21] <ariya> it needs another rebase anyway
[14:24:36] <ariya> I think after I land the token-delegate feature, let's just make typescript=master
[14:24:39] <jlast> sounds good. for the record typescript-formatter was in package.json, so it looks like it's just the version thing
[14:24:46] <ariya> and keep the 2.7 continues to 2.x
[14:25:31] <jlast> would 2.7 include TS?
[14:28:21] <jlast> oh one other small thing with TS before I forget, would it help to add src/*.js to .gitignore?
[14:28:41] <jlast> i'm not sure because it might be helpful to expose those files too after compile
[14:29:05] <ariya> probably keep 2.x as JavaScript-y as possible :-)
[14:29:18] <ariya> I thought about that gitignore too
[14:29:28] <ariya> maybe we need to bite the bullet and just do it
[14:29:49] <ariya> they pollutes git status
[14:30:22] <jlast> I'm also afraid other contributors might add them to PRs
[14:30:50] <ariya> true
[14:30:56] <ariya> another good suggestion
[14:30:59] <ariya> keep them coming
[14:32:01] <jlast> submitting a small package.json fixup now actually
[14:32:16] <jlast> I keep forgetting which are the top-level scripts that should be called directly
[14:32:29] <jlast> and which are only there to be called by others (private)
[14:33:17] <ariya> before, I sort them manually
[14:33:32] <ariya> separate with blank lines etc
[14:33:44] <ariya> but `npm` CLI, e.g. `npm --save-dev` will reformat it again
[14:34:14] <ariya> is there package.json's scripts -> dot file?
[14:34:37] <jlast> oh sure, that makes sense
[14:35:36] <jlast> hmm, i'm not sure if there's a way to get around this. I remember forest being strict w/ the JSON.stringify call that reformats it
[14:35:39] <jlast> pretty silly
[14:35:40] <ariya> https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm2dot
[14:36:04] <ariya> we need something similar for scripts
[14:36:11] <ariya> `scripts` section, that is
[14:36:20] <ariya> thought it'll be more or less heuristics
[14:36:25] <jlast> haha
[14:37:11] <jlast> or maybe prefix "private" scripts with _
[14:37:21] <jlast> so regression-tests becomes _regression-tests
[14:37:47] <jlast> it's a little ugly honestly
[14:38:01] <jlast> anyways, i have to run. but i'll think about it some more
[14:38:46] <ariya> cool thanks
[14:38:50] <ariya> see you next week folks!
