[11:00:04] <ariya> good morning/afternoon/evening!
[11:02:32] <ariya> everyone is here?
[11:02:40] <gibson042> here
[11:04:09] <jlast> hello!
[11:04:41] <ariya> hi gibson042 jlast
[11:04:46] <ariya> mikesherov_: around?
[11:05:22] <ariya> seems that I'm taking notes again
[11:05:26] <ariya> let's start
[11:05:29] <ariya> since last time
[11:05:39] <ariya> we have a browser test runner thanks to jlast!!
[11:06:21] <ariya> jlast: I'm thinking that https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1004 can be closed soon
[11:06:29] <ariya> dunno if you plan to add other browsers, e.g. Firefox
[11:06:50] <ariya> further enhancements (unifying the Node.js runner & browser runner), coverage, etc can be filed as a separate issue
[11:07:13] <ariya> now that I'm thinking about, I doubt that we desperately need code coverage tracking for the browser tests
[11:08:04] <jlast> ariya, i think 1004 could be closed soon too
[11:08:10] <jlast> i have a local branch for unifying
[11:08:33] <ariya> sounds good
[11:08:35] <jlast> also, i found that in chrome there's an issue with the reporter where it stops after 20% of the tests
[11:08:51] <ariya> hmm, it seems to work fine for me
[11:08:56] <jlast> this only started yesterday after the merge, so i'm kinda curious where that came from
[11:09:23] <jlast> yea the node reporter is fine and reports 1269 succesful tests so i'm not too worried
[11:09:41] <ariya> maybe we need a fancier reporter to troubleshoot it?
[11:09:42] <jlast> and yea, i think code coverage can be a later ticket
[11:09:42] <ariya> https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-mocha-reporter
[11:09:48] <jlast> and more inline with codecov
[11:10:02] <ariya> there are more further opportunities with karma
[11:10:15] <ariya> e.g. running the tests with sauce labs to get extensive cross-browser support information
[11:10:26] <jlast> yea, i think that's a really good idea
[11:10:43] <jlast> maybe we leave the ticket open and list a couple of these things
[11:11:11] <ariya> surething, let me spawn that sauce labs idea as an issue
[11:11:11] <jlast> i'd also like to add browser-test utilities for helping debug esprima
[11:11:34] <ariya> I find out that the best to debug it is still with Node.js
[11:11:39] <ariya> but that's because I'm using WebStorm
[11:12:06] <jlast> oh yea, that's interesting. I've been debugging with Chrome DevTools and workspaces
[11:12:36] <ariya> give WebStorm a try, I can definitely help
[11:12:50] <jlast> I actually probably wouldn't have done the project lol if I thought of that
[11:13:14] <jlast> whats your workflow like?
[11:13:38] <jlast> do you set a breakpoint in webstorm and run one esprima.parse('foo') test or unit-tests.js?
[11:13:55] <ariya> yup, pretty much so
[11:13:58] <ariya> dead easy
[11:14:37] <jlast> hmm... ive been thinking about writing some getting started contributing documentation
[11:14:49] <jlast> would be nice to write some of this down
[11:15:01] <ariya> feel free to add such pages, just make PR agains the gh-pages branch
[11:15:22] <ariya> related to "since last time"
[11:15:27] <jlast> cool.
[11:15:32] <ariya> we also have SMP Unicode support (aka astral code)
[11:15:42] <ariya> I think it's about time to release 2.5
[11:15:50] <ariya> I also want to close https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1099
[11:15:59] <ariya> technically speaking, we're feature complete w.r.t ES6 support
[11:16:13] <ariya> there are bugs/defects, but those can be tracked separately
[11:16:54] <jlast> That makes sense. Also exciting
[11:17:11] <ariya> jlast: I should be able to take a look at your PR https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1256 soon
[11:17:23] <ariya> I think we can focus 2.6 on various improvement and bug fixes
[11:17:49] <jlast> thanks. I was surprised that the change introduce token changes...
[11:18:36] <ariya> if there's no objection, let's aim this Friday for 2.5 release
[11:21:38] <jlast> ariya - trying to gather the consensus for this ticket: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1006
[11:22:12] <jlast> this looks closer https://github.com/estree/estree/issues/6
[11:22:39] <ariya> just create a PR to estree, similar to https://github.com/dherman/estree/commit/70ba4ab1fd8de48ca9dfd94a79820d3fe65d4009
[11:22:57] <ariya> for whatever reason, dherman didn't merge it to estree upstream, only to his fork
[11:23:54] <jlast> not sure if i follow?
[11:24:20] <jlast> is this a change to estree, esprima, or both?
[11:24:31] <jlast> the esprima change seems more straightforward lol
[11:24:59] <gibson042> I'd like to see the estree change land first, so that esprima can adhere
[11:25:02] <ariya> estree is the spec, it needs to change first
[11:25:13] <jlast> got it.
[11:25:34] <gibson042> since esprima provides `raw`, it is _technically_ possible (albeit cumbersome) to get at the information already
[11:26:48] <ariya> anything else we shall discuss?
[11:29:18] <ariya> I think that's it for this week!
[11:29:32] <ariya> thank you and see you again next week folks!
