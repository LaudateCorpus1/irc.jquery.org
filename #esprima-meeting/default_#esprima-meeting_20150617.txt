[11:00:56] <ariya> good morning/afternoon/evening!
[11:03:13] <ariya> is everyone ready? shall we start?
[11:05:13] <ariya> hello gibson042
[11:05:19] <gibson042> hello
[11:05:19] <ariya> poke ikarienator mikesherov
[11:07:44] <ariya> let's get started and I'll be writing the minutes
[11:08:13] <ariya> since last time we're here, 2.3 has been released (tagged git, npm, website demo)
[11:08:20] <ariya> actually, it was yesterday
[11:08:53] <ariya> and when I checked https://www.npmjs.com/package/esprima, seems that the download now reaches ~7 millions
[11:11:29] <ariya> now let's focus on 2.4
[11:11:56] <ariya> I tentatively set the target date for beginning of July, post Independence Day
[11:12:09] <ariya> I'm going to tackle for-of iteration, aka https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1047
[11:12:30] <gibson042> right, sorry :\
[11:13:20] <ariya> gibson042: no worries
[11:13:26] <ariya> last important news snippet
[11:13:36] <ariya> next week is jQuery SF: http://jquerysf.com/
[11:13:49] <ariya> mikesherov and I will talk about basics of JS AST
[11:13:58] <ariya> in the afternoon we plan to discuss about CST
[11:14:16] <ariya> throughout the day, probably working together to implement some stuff, hackathon style
[11:14:50] <gibson042> remote friendly? I will not be in SF, but would love to participate (or at least listen live)
[11:15:04] <ariya> depends on the logistics
[11:15:20] <ariya> we'll keep that in mind, and hopefully the wifi will cooperate with us
[11:18:12] <ariya> we have a bunch of Shape crews, including our interns, present at jQuery SF
[11:18:19] <ariya> I guess that's all I have today
[11:18:25] <ariya> anyone has any topic to discuss?
[11:21:08] <gibson042> nothing from me
[11:24:55] <ariya> that's all for today, thank you folks
[11:24:56] * ariya waves
