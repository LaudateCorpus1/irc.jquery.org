[14:04:06] <ariya> hello folks
[14:06:07] <ariya> I've been superbusy and could hop on this channel for a while
[14:06:12] <ariya> could not
[14:09:31] <ariya> it seems that it's still quiet as usual :-)
[14:15:02] <gibson042> pretty much :)
[14:15:11] <gibson042> but I am here
[14:20:04] <ariya> so let's started
[14:20:35] <ariya> 3.0 refactoring/modularization is almost complete
[14:20:52] <ariya> I think I ought to create a meta issue just to capture the activities :-/
[14:23:02] <ariya> completed estree conformance
[14:23:07] <ariya> try statement handlers: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1030
[14:23:12] <ariya> try statement handlers: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1030
[14:23:14] <ariya> left to be done
[14:23:19] <ariya> default param: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1081
[14:23:36] <ariya> after that, probably worthwhile releasing 3.0
[14:24:22] <ariya> or perhaps waiting for feb, to align with last year's 2.0 release
[14:24:23] <ariya> http://blog.jquery.com/2015/02/06/esprima-2-0-released/
[14:24:26] <gibson042> yeah; cool
[14:25:24] <ariya> gibson042: thinking of coming to Fluent in SF this March?
[14:27:00] <gibson042> unfortunately, it looks unlikely
[14:28:56] <ariya> well too bad, perhaps next time
[14:29:07] <ariya> that's all I have for now
[14:29:25] <ariya> likely I won't be online again till next year so Happy Holiday and see you all in 2016!
[14:29:34] <gibson042> happy new year
