[10:56:08] <ikarienator> Hi guys! I will be picking up my in-laws now so I cannot attend the meeting. Talk to you guys next time.
[11:01:13] <ariya> good morning everyone!
[11:01:20] <jeffmo> howdy
[11:01:52] <ariya> mikesherov is still busy so I’m taking the minutes again
[11:01:57] <ariya> everyone is ready?
[11:03:20] <gibson042> I'm here
[11:03:30] <ariya> OK let’s start
[11:03:30] <gibson042> no changes since last week, though
[11:03:50] <ariya> so mikesherov is still swamped and therefore we don’t have 2.2 yet
[11:04:06] <ariya> I’m helping him landing the template literal support, also with ikarienator’s help
[11:04:10] <ariya> ETA is end of today
[11:04:22] <ariya> and I’ll do the usual testing tomorrow so 2.2 is aimed for Friday
[11:04:53] <ariya> meanwhile, ICYMI, FB is switching to Babel
[11:05:00] <ariya> https://github.com/facebook/esprima/issues/111
[11:05:32] <ariya> jeffmo: any official stance on your continued participation in upstreaming things like generator and such?
[11:05:39] <jeffmo> yes, at some point — sorry I couldn’t give a proper heads up. poshannessy jumped the gun even though I asked him to hold off
[11:06:03] <jeffmo> ariya: I will try to help finish out that generator PR. I’ve been swamped by Flow stuff lately, so it’s been hard for me to devote time to this
[11:06:39] <ariya> jeffmo: no worries
[11:07:02] <ariya> jeffmo: I also want to use Flow at some point for many projects so keep improving it :-)
[11:07:09] <jeffmo> :)
[11:07:43] <ariya> for 2.3, the goal is to have generator, for of and meta property
[11:08:18] <ariya> jeffmo: BTW this is where I wish esprima-fb was called jsxparser
[11:08:36] <jeffmo> well, no more worries soon I guess :)
[11:08:37] <ariya> jeffmo: people get confused and some already asked me what this change means from esprima (upstream)
[11:08:47] <jeffmo> I see
[11:08:49] <ariya> s/from/for
[11:09:03] <ariya> anyhow, not much we can do there
[11:09:25] <jeffmo> I’ll see if Paul can message it more clearly that upstream is forging ahead on new features, and so it soon won’t need esprima-fb anymore
[11:09:35] <jeffmo> s/it/people/
[11:10:08] <ariya> sounds good
[11:10:30] <ariya> we don’t have many other agenda items this week
[11:10:38] <ariya> gibson042: I assume that you will be doing for of at some point?
[11:10:48] <gibson042> yep
[11:10:48] <ariya> ikarienator: how’s the two-stage parsing on shift?
[11:11:17] <ariya> jeffmo: oh have you decided on jquery SF?
[11:11:29] <ariya> nzakas: any estree folks plan to attend jQuery SF?
[11:11:35] <ariya> http://jquerysf.com/ (June 22-23).
[11:11:57] <nzakas> assume you mean espree? :)
[11:12:10] <ariya> ah sorry
[11:12:24] <nzakas> jamund might be around, the others aren't local
[11:12:31] <jeffmo> ariya: yea, I won’t be able to make that (have family stuff planned in Florida for the weekend right before)
[11:13:02] <jeffmo> happy to try and skype into the bar though :p
[11:13:29] <ariya> jeffmo: Florida is not much worse choice than California!
[11:13:41] <ariya> jeffmo: probably even warmer during that time
[11:14:00] <jeffmo> yea, warm beaches ftw
[11:14:14] <ariya> nzakas: let us if jamund plans to show up
[11:14:17] <ariya> let us know
[11:14:22] <nzakas> will do
[11:14:59] <ariya> gibson042: make sure you cover invalid intiailizer
[11:15:06] <ariya> gibson042: for(var x = 1 in …)
[11:16:08] * ariya was disconnected
[11:16:15] <jeffmo> didn’t miss anything
[11:16:42] <ariya> that’s all the agenda for this week
[11:16:51] <ariya> anyone has something else to discuss?
[11:17:11] <jeffmo> nada
[11:18:50] <ariya> OK sounds good
[11:19:05] <ariya> let’s enjoy Tax Day and see you folks next week!
[11:19:13] <ariya> thank you everyone and bye
