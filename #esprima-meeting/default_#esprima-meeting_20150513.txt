[11:01:10] <ariya> good morning/afternoon everyone!
[11:04:41] <ariya> hi gibson042 jeffmo
[11:04:46] <jeffmo> howdy
[11:04:49] <gibson042> hello
[11:04:59] <ariya> ready to get started mikesherov/
[11:06:21] <ariya> I'll be taking notes again, while waiting for mikesherov
[11:06:31] <ariya> "Since last time"
[11:06:47] <ariya> so I took the generator code from david he and it is born again as
[11:06:54] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1178
[11:07:09] <ariya> please review so that we can land it :-)
[11:07:22] <ariya> there is a side discussion on delegate/delegating/isDelegator
[11:07:35] <ariya> jeffmo: I think I'll just move it over to estree, once I file an issue on that
[11:08:43] <jeffmo> ariya: sounds good. I hesitated posting my comment as I don’t see it as a deadly blocker, but I guess now’s the time for bikeshedding if ever
[11:09:00] <ariya> surething
[11:09:09] <ariya> I also don't have any strong preference of one name vs another
[11:09:33] <ariya> so, beside that, nothing else really happened on my side
[11:09:40] <ariya> gibson042: still chugging along with for of?
[11:09:53] <ariya> now that I'm almost gone with generator, I can have some cycles to help you with that
[11:09:59] <gibson042> hoping to chug along is more like it
[11:10:12] <gibson042> I haven't touched it in a long while, and this week doesn't look good either
[11:11:46] <ariya> gibson042: I can complete it, if you want
[11:12:14] <gibson042> if you have the cycles and nothing else takes priority, that would be ok
[11:12:36] <ariya> gibson042: surething, just pass me whatever you have: code, notes, etc
[11:12:47] <gibson042> sure
[11:13:02] <ariya> I assume we still have no progress on meta as well?
[11:14:08] <ariya> markelog__: still interested in tackling spread arguments?
[11:18:39] <ariya> seems today is another quiet day :-)
[11:18:53] <ariya> well jeffmo, I'll be waiting for more of your generator review
[11:19:10] <ariya> also, don't forget that jquery sf is coming up soon
[11:19:25] <jeffmo> ariya: sounds good. I should be able to spend a little time on reviewing here in a few mins
[11:19:36] <ariya> jeffmo: sounds good, TIA
[11:19:38] <ariya> gibson042: ikarienator: jeffmo: mikesherov any other topics we shall discuss this time?
[11:19:51] <jeffmo> nothing from me
[11:21:38] <gibson042> nothing from me either
[11:21:44] <ikarienator> nothing here
[11:21:53] <ariya> cool, let's call it a day and head for an early lunch :-)
[11:22:01] <ariya> thanks everyone and see you again next week
