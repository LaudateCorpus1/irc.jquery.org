[10:58:21] <ariya> hola
[10:59:24] <mikesherov> hello!
[11:00:09] <mikesherov> ariya: gibson042 markelog ikarienator meeting time
[11:00:52] * ariya is ready
[11:01:11] <gibson042> here
[11:02:29] <mikesherov> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l02VT94tdphwUUZfPJorRYOY0Q_v41R_TyYhKayiP9M/edit#
[11:03:04] <mikesherov> Esprima 2.2 was released on Friday!
[11:03:17] <mikesherov> Err, two fridays at this point?
[11:03:34] <ariya> indeed
[11:03:41] <mikesherov> great
[11:03:48] <mikesherov> is jeffmo not coming to meeting?
[11:04:13] <mikesherov> Let's discuss harmony branch...
[11:04:25] <ariya> he's also not in #esprima
[11:04:28] <mikesherov> OK
[11:04:34] <mikesherov> JSCS is still tracking it harmony branch
[11:04:45] <mikesherov> until Esprima has full es6
[11:05:10] <ariya> I thought it's already a separate repo?
[11:05:13] <mikesherov> it is
[11:05:31] <mikesherov> So yeah, we can nuke it
[11:05:35] <ariya> will it be impacted by upstream harmony branch?
[11:05:45] <mikesherov> No
[11:05:58] <mikesherov> However, I think we need to have a strategy for es7 features / feature flags before we can nuke
[11:06:08] <mikesherov> it was not only facebook who cared about that branch
[11:06:17] <mikesherov> recast cares as well
[11:06:35] <mikesherov> also, we've launched 2.2, and we said we can discuss feature flags / es5 after 2.2
[11:06:56] <mikesherov> so perhaps we can discuss that now as part of how we deprecated harmony?
[11:07:33] <mikesherov> ariya ^
[11:07:34] <ariya> how's the harmony branch related to the feature/es7?
[11:07:47] <mikesherov> well, recast was going to land async / await in harmony
[11:07:58] <mikesherov> ben wanted to land it
[11:08:31] <mikesherov> Now that es6 has finalized, there will be increased pressure for us to have es7 strategy, just figured we can lump the discussions together
[11:09:00] <ariya> recast is switching to babel-core
[11:09:05] <ariya> since it needs JSX
[11:09:08] <mikesherov> :-\
[11:09:20] <ariya> async await is already in esprima-fb anyway
[11:09:39] <mikesherov> Seems like a lot of our former consumers switch away because of JSX / feature flags
[11:09:54] <mikesherov> fb / eslint / recast
[11:10:02] <ariya> switch away from esprima-fb, that is
[11:10:13] <mikesherov> well, and esprima in general!
[11:10:18] <mikesherov> we lost that support
[11:10:36] <mikesherov> just something to consider about whether we care to court the jsx / bleeding edge crowd
[11:10:40] <ariya> to restate the situation: if we nuke upstream harmony branch, what is the impact?
[11:11:15] <mikesherov> nothing, there is no impact now that those who cared have switched to babel or acorn
[11:11:35] <ariya> ok let's do that then
[11:11:39] <mikesherov> ok
[11:11:59] <mikesherov> But we don't want to address the reason we are even deleting it in the first place?
[11:12:01] <ariya> also, we should close issues related to harmony branch since the branch is not going to live any longer
[11:12:06] <mikesherov> because we lost those who cared about it?
[11:12:26] <mikesherov> Yes, we should def close those issues.
[11:12:35] <mikesherov> proper repo maintenance and all
[11:12:50] <mikesherov> gibson042: michaelficarra ikarienator any objections?
[11:12:58] <ikarienator> nope
[11:13:08] <gibson042> nope
[11:13:29] <michaelficarra> no
[11:13:40] <mikesherov> ok, then lets move on to 2.3 progress
[11:13:43] <ariya> so I'll create a ticket and assign it to myself
[11:13:53] <ariya> I have a lot fun nuking stuff :-)
[11:14:55] <michaelficarra> git push origin :harmony
[11:15:06] <mikesherov> gibson042: ariya progress on generators, meta properties, and for of?
[11:15:31] <gibson042> for-of is started but not done, should be up and even landed by next meeting
[11:16:10] <mikesherov> great
[11:16:23] <mikesherov> can you update https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1099 with the issue so our es6 tracker is up to date?
[11:16:45] <ariya> jeffmo gave a lot of good review on the generator stuff
[11:17:03] <mikesherov> ok, great!
[11:17:08] <mikesherov> who is on meta property?
[11:17:09] <ariya> there is still no update on the PR though
[11:17:14] <mikesherov> and is there a ticket?
[11:17:41] <ariya> I can update the PR based on the review and finish generator, if there is no further activity there
[11:17:43] <mikesherov> for generators, lets see if the OP responds within a week
[11:17:53] <mikesherov> and then take it the rest of the way
[11:17:58] <mikesherov> ?
[11:18:44] <ariya> meta: isn't it also you gibson042?
[11:19:10] <mikesherov> if so, please make sure there is an issue assigned to you gibson042 and add it to the main tracker
[11:19:10] <ariya> mikesherov: it's been a week already
[11:19:21] <gibson042> not right now, but I can take it after for-of if it's still open
[11:19:24] <mikesherov> ariya: ok, up to you how much longer you want to wait then
[11:19:25] <ariya> I'd say let's just finish it based on jeffmo's feedback
[11:19:32] <mikesherov> OK, fair enough ariya
[11:19:40] <ariya> mikesherov: I'll put a note first in the PR
[11:20:16] <mikesherov> OK, then let's see where we're at next week then
[11:21:11] <ariya> also, I have a discussion with ikarienator the other day on the delegator
[11:21:13] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1113
[11:21:24] <ariya> and also https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1068
[11:21:37] <ariya> conclusion so far: it's not possible to implement comment attachment during the parsing stage
[11:21:50] <ariya> since the cover grammar prohibits us to do so
[11:22:23] <mikesherov> maybe during second phase
[11:22:35] <mikesherov> during early error phase, if we're doing 2 phase
[11:23:10] <mikesherov> If that's true, perhaps we should defer discussion until we get to that part... after 2.3?
[11:23:10] <ariya> indeed
[11:23:11] <ikarienator> or 3 phases
[11:23:35] <ariya> mikesherov: agree
[11:23:47] <ariya> or remove the support for comment attachment, possibly in 3.x
[11:24:03] <ariya> with an included utility function to do that as a post processing stage
[11:24:10] <mikesherov> right
[11:24:14] <ariya> in all cases, let's defer that
[11:24:26] <mikesherov> as far as nzakas is concerned, as long as it isn't slower ;-)
[11:24:37] <ariya> it might be slower
[11:24:42] <mikesherov> I'd really like to get espree dead!
[11:24:46] <ariya> but correctness trumps performance
[11:24:53] <mikesherov> yes yes
[11:24:56] <ariya> btw, token delegation is probably fine
[11:24:58] <mikesherov> I meant just quicker than espree
[11:24:58] <michaelficarra> me too
[11:24:59] <ariya> this is about syntax delegation
[11:25:10] <mikesherov> ah, right
[11:25:15] <michaelficarra> I'm tired of espree issues being raised in the eslint repo
[11:25:22] <michaelficarra> and then not fixed properly :-(
[11:25:23] <mikesherov> Me too
[11:25:38] <ariya> michaelficarra: try red bull, it increases your energy level
[11:25:56] <mikesherov> OK, so for next meeting, I want to discuss feature flags once and for all!
[11:26:15] <mikesherov> I will refrain for yet another meeting from trying to arm wrestle ariya :-)
[11:26:32] <michaelficarra> I am already strongly opposed to feature flags, but we'll see how it goes :-P
[11:27:23] <ariya> I have no stance, as long as it's maintainable and it preserves correctness
[11:27:46] <ariya> hence why I think we need to be confident there is full es5/es6 correct support, in any cases
[11:27:54] <mikesherov> yes yes
[11:27:59] <ariya> a side note on two-phase parsing:
[11:28:00] <ariya> http://engineering.shapesecurity.com/2015/04/two-phase-parsing.html
[11:28:05] <mikesherov> yes!
[11:28:11] <mikesherov> OK, I have to leave in a minute
[11:28:20] <mikesherov> as far as jQuerySF goes...
[11:28:20] <ariya> thanks mikesherov
[11:28:43] <mikesherov> I will send out draft email to the group here to ask the larger group to meet there to discuss CST
[11:28:45] <michaelficarra> ariya: do we know who we're sending to jQuery SF?
[11:28:52] <mikesherov> when you all say OK, I'll send it
[11:28:55] <markelog> so what about jsx?
[11:29:02] <ariya> michaelficarra: not yet, you're supposed to work on a talk proposal? :-)
[11:29:11] <michaelficarra> I am?
[11:29:16] <michaelficarra> make Bei do it
[11:29:19] <markelog> is there a roadmap?
[11:29:23] <gibson042> unfortunately, I won't be able to make jQuerySF after all (schedule conflict)
[11:29:30] <mikesherov> ariya: did you submit our combined esprima/jscs proposal?
[11:29:42] <ariya> markelog: I am not opposed to it, we just need to get es6 features done first
[11:29:49] <ariya> mikesherov: not yet, I'll send you an email later today
[11:29:56] <mikesherov> kk
[11:30:00] <markelog> is that possible to use a plugin for jsx feature?
[11:30:09] <mikesherov> markelog: once we land es6 support
[11:30:10] <markelog> it might weird since its not a js
[11:30:11] <ariya> markelog: surething
[11:30:12] <markelog> after all
[11:30:34] <mikesherov> we might expose the subparse functions as properties on an object
[11:30:36] <markelog> does esprima has plugin api?
[11:30:39] <mikesherov> so jsx can be a hook in to those
[11:30:48] <mikesherov> still in theoretical phase at the moment
[11:30:56] <mikesherov> markelog: not yet we don't
[11:31:13] <markelog> it was done for acorn by the third party as i recall
[11:31:22] <markelog> through api interface
[11:31:29] <mikesherov> markelog: if you'd like to help us finish es6 features (spread arguments is a good candidate), we get closer to plug in API
[11:31:42] <mikesherov> yes, acorn does what we're proposing here
[11:31:48] <markelog> mikesherov: is there ticket for that?
[11:31:58] <markelog> for api i mean
[11:32:04] <mikesherov> it doesn't exist yet
[11:32:15] <mikesherov> Maybe we should have a ticket at this point ariya
[11:32:27] <mikesherov> I have to go folks, ariya markelog you can take it from here
[11:32:30] <ikarienator> Can we make the parse class first before we do anything?
[11:32:42] <ikarienator> So we can have plugins
[11:32:56] <michaelficarra> yes, we should open an issue for it
[11:33:02] <markelog> mikesherov: i could probably check out the spread thing
[11:33:04] <markelog> is there a ticket
[11:33:09] <ariya> sure mikesherov, thanks a lot and see you next week
[11:33:11] <markelog> although, can't promise anything
[11:33:40] <ariya> markelog: master ES6 tracking is https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1099
[11:33:54] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1168
[11:33:55] <markelog> )
[11:34:08] <ariya> markelog: cool
[11:34:11] <markelog> yeah, there is no ticket for it )
[11:34:14] <markelog> for the spread
[11:34:31] <markelog> you need a ticket first, right?
[11:34:40] <michaelficarra> wow, nice issue lol
[11:34:54] <ariya> markelog: yes, look at the past ticket for an example
[11:35:27] <markelog> will create one
[11:35:46] <ariya> markelog: sounds good, thanks
[11:35:57] <ariya> all, I think that's it for this week
[11:36:12] <markelog> okay, created - https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1169
[11:36:24] <markelog> could you link it from the master ticket?
[11:37:06] <ariya> markelog: will do
[11:37:15] <markelog> ariya: okay, thanks!
[11:37:51] <ariya> thanks everyone and see you next week!
