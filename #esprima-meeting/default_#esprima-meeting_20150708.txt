[11:03:00] <mikesherov_> jlast: ariya ikarienator meeting time
[11:03:03] <ariya> hello everyone!
[11:03:46] <ariya> mikesherov_: would you be willing to take notes this time?
[11:03:53] <mikesherov_> sure
[11:04:05] <ariya> wonderful thanks
[11:04:19] <ariya> let's get started
[11:04:25] <mikesherov_> yup
[11:05:40] <mikesherov_> So, since last time?
[11:05:48] <ariya> meta property is landed
[11:05:57] <ariya> I also fixed the long standing issue with yield
[11:06:03] <mikesherov_> hi AndChat|402864 which I assume is gibson
[11:06:08] <mikesherov_> yes, saw that
[11:06:35] <ariya> I think that's all that happened
[11:06:55] <ariya> at least from my side
[11:07:10] <ariya> expect one more PR from me today
[11:07:20] <mikesherov_> Great
[11:07:27] <mikesherov_> I'm looking for something to pick up
[11:07:33] <mikesherov_> ariya: any suggestions?
[11:07:47] <mikesherov_> to help get us to full es6 that is mid-level difficulty?
[11:07:50] <ariya> once those 2 PRs from me got reviewed and landed, I am trying to handle ES6 identifier (halfway there)
[11:08:13] <ariya> mikesherov_: how about codecov? or even sourceType
[11:08:22] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1159
[11:08:32] <mikesherov_> I can handle sourceType
[11:08:36] <ariya> sourceType will be a massive patch since it will touch every test fixture's baseline
[11:08:57] <mikesherov_> I can just delete all fixtures and rerun :-)
[11:09:03] <ariya> yup :-)
[11:09:20] <ariya> mikesherov_: also your PR https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1107 is severly outdated with all the most recent changes
[11:09:27] <ariya> probably better to close it and recreate it again
[11:09:32] <mikesherov_> yeah, will do
[11:10:04] <ariya> once I'm done with ES6 identifier, I want to include https://github.com/michaelficarra/everything.js in the test suite
[11:10:08] <mikesherov_> on that, what I'll end up with for the comparison is I'm going to be lenient on the tokenizer mischaracterizing a `keyword` for an identifier
[11:10:23] <mikesherov_> because tokenizer by itself can't fully know without speed penalty
[11:10:31] <ariya> yup
[11:10:39] <ariya> or might as well just compare the raw value
[11:10:48] <mikesherov_> raw value is good too
[11:10:56] <ariya> theoretically, if the scanning is wrong, it won't recognize number as a whole and thus raw value comparison is sufficient
[11:11:00] <mikesherov_> can we get michaelficarra to contribute this himself to esprima?
[11:11:28] <ariya> mikesherov_: it's so simple to integrate everything.js :-)
[11:11:32] <ariya> much harder to make it pass
[11:11:41] <ariya> (but we will, soon)
[11:11:53] <mikesherov_> just looking for ways to get other contributors is all
[11:13:12] <ariya> mikesherov_: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1210 is also good
[11:13:12] <ariya> if someone wants an easy one
[11:13:12] <mikesherov_> jlast: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1210
[11:13:12] <mikesherov_> you up for it?
[11:13:12] <mikesherov_> speaking of which, jlast you here?
[11:14:46] <mikesherov_> I guess not?
[11:16:14] <jlast> hey mike
[11:16:14] <ariya> once es6 identifier is in, should we release this as 2.5?
[11:16:14] <jlast> would be happy to take it
[11:16:14] <mikesherov_> yes, ariya let's
[11:16:14] <mikesherov_> let's release early and often
[11:16:14] <mikesherov_> I like the new pace
[11:16:14] <AndChat|402864> +1
[11:16:46] <mikesherov_> gibson042_: do you have free time yet?
[11:16:53] <mikesherov_> Would love to get you contributing
[11:17:03] <mikesherov_> code on top of the thoughts
[11:17:19] <ariya> actually I think I have an idea that can use your help gibson042_
[11:17:30] <gibson042_> Likewise, but probably not before jQuery 3.0
[11:17:32] <ariya> let me write down clearly and I'll shoot you mikesherov_ and gibson042_ an email first
[11:17:33] <mikesherov_> jlast: any update on test runner btw?
[11:17:38] <jlast> a couple
[11:17:40] <gibson042_> or at least the beta
[11:17:46] <mikesherov_> sounds good ariya
[11:17:55] <jlast> I took a look at espree's test setup
[11:18:02] <gibson042_> Please do ariya
[11:18:42] <jlast> there tests are nicely organized with mocha, but the runner still relies on node (shelljs) to load fixtures and tests
[11:18:59] <mikesherov_> right
[11:19:13] <mikesherov_> that manifest idea seems pretty good
[11:19:31] <jlast> i filed a ticket with espree to see if nicholas had any ideas
[11:19:38] <ariya> jlast: would you be open to take a look at karma first?
[11:19:38] <mikesherov_> interesting
[11:19:40] <jlast> but i plan to move forward with the fixture json file
[11:19:51] <jlast> ariya, happy to
[11:20:03] <gibson042_> Oh, what came of in-person CST talks?
[11:20:04] <mikesherov_> karma still can't list the list of fixture files ariya , right?
[11:20:13] <jlast> could you walk through that approach again
[11:20:14] <jlast> https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-html2js-preprocessor
[11:20:14] <ariya> if you're not familiar with it yet, I think I've written a blog post useful for a quick start
[11:20:20] <mikesherov_> gibson042_: I will publish the results today in the ESTree repo
[11:20:25] <mikesherov_> I've slacking on that
[11:20:29] <jlast> i wasn't sure exactly what it'd get us
[11:20:41] <ariya> jlast: http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/10/code-coverage-of-jasmine-tests-using-istanbul-and-karma.html
[11:21:08] <ariya> jlast: the preprocessor will expose the content of each file as an item in an array
[11:21:24] <ariya> jlast: the test runner then needs to execute each one, just like what we have right now with Node.js runner
[11:21:53] <jlast> ahh i see
[11:23:09] <jlast> so, to see if i got it, we'd read the tests/fixtures into memory as something like window.__tests__
[11:23:18] <mikesherov_> well alright, seems straightforward then
[11:23:36] <mikesherov_> cause then you can start karma with the chrome runner
[11:23:42] <mikesherov_> and you have devtools
[11:23:44] <jlast> this doesn't seem too scary https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-html2js-preprocessor/blob/master/lib/html2js.js
[11:27:23] <mikesherov_> Fiddle with it jlast
[11:28:39] <jlast> yup - will share some findings in channel on friday (should have a chance then)
[11:31:06] <mikesherov_> great
[11:31:12] <mikesherov_> even by next wednesday is great
[11:31:21] <mikesherov_> anyone have anything else for now?
[11:31:28] <mikesherov_> ariya: jlast gibson042_ ?
[11:31:32] <mikesherov_> ikarienator: ?
[11:31:37] <ariya> that's all from me
[11:32:09] <gibson042_> All set here
[11:32:15] <jlast> good
[11:33:14] <ariya> see you next week folks!
[11:33:26] * ariya waves
[11:33:38] <mikesherov_> bye!
