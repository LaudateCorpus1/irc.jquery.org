[11:01:09] <ariya> hola everyone!
[11:04:31] <ariya> is mikesherov_ around?
[11:04:36] <ariya> otherwise, I'll be taking minutes
[11:05:26] <ariya> let's get started
[11:05:40] <ariya> Since last time
[11:05:52] <ariya> I've released 2.4.0 followed quickly by 2.4.1 for bug fixes
[11:06:05] <ariya> some minor infrastructure change on tests
[11:06:13] <ariya> we also now run downstream project tests on travis ci
[11:08:21] <ariya> we also skipped testing on node v0.11
[11:09:21] <ariya> other than, it's pretty normal last week
[11:09:27] <ariya> for the forthcoming 2.5
[11:09:37] <ariya> my implementation of meta.property is ready, going to land it pretty soon
[11:09:42] <ariya> thanks to the review from ikarienator!
[11:10:27] <ariya> we probably want to include one more feature before calling it 2.5
[11:10:42] <ariya> I'm thinking of ES6 identifier support, but I'm undecided about that
[11:12:03] <mikesherov_> Hi
[11:12:14] <jlast> Hey
[11:12:17] <jlast> ariya, i started working on a web test runner on monday
[11:12:31] <ariya> hi jlast
[11:12:36] <jlast> the goal is to facilitate DevTools test debugging
[11:12:52] <ariya> cool
[11:13:02] <ariya> I'm also resuming my attempt to use karma test runner
[11:13:09] <jlast> oh cool
[11:13:32] <ariya> unfortunately seems that I need to write a custom karma adapter
[11:13:52] <ariya> since our tests are more in the line of input -> process -> output, compare output to baseline
[11:13:52] <jlast> mikesherov_: pointed me towards espree, it looks like they adapted the test runner
[11:14:18] <mikesherov_> seems jlast had a good thought about the node version of the test runner generating a json manifest of the tests to run in the web version.
[11:14:37] <ariya> espree is using the standard mocha runner
[11:15:25] <ariya> karma has a preprocessor that dumps js content to be accessible as a property
[11:15:37] <ariya> but now I forget the name of it
[11:16:01] <ariya> ah, found it
[11:16:01] <ariya> https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-html2js-preprocessor
[11:16:39] <ariya> I plan to combine it with my custom karma adapter
[11:16:46] <ariya> let's see if this experiment blows up in my face :-)
[11:17:24] <jlast> haha
[11:17:26] <mikesherov_> Perhaps we can let it blow up in jlast's face?
[11:17:35] <ariya> ikarienator: mikesherov_ : I still got a couple pull requests which can use some review :-)
[11:17:43] <mikesherov_> Give someone new a chance to fail miserably?
[11:18:11] <mikesherov_> ariya, saw those, will review shortly.
[11:18:31] <jlast> mikesherov_: sounds appealing
[11:19:06] <ariya> in all cases, jlast, feel free to share your experience and outcome
[11:19:53] <jlast> yep
[11:21:18] <mikesherov_> Ok, I g2g, still en route from sesame place with my children. Time to drive home!
[11:21:28] <ariya> mikesherov_: thanks and take care!
[11:21:35] <ariya> anyone else have any topics to discuss?
[11:23:37] <ariya> I think that's about it for today and let's call it a day :-)
[11:23:46] <ariya> thank you everyone and see you again next week!
