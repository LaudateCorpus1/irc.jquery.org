[10:56:15] <ariya> good morning/afternoon/evening everyone!
[10:56:41] <mikesherov_> Hey ariya !
[10:57:12] <ariya> long time no see!
[10:57:16] * ariya is glad to be back here
[10:57:26] <mikesherov_> me too
[10:57:34] <mikesherov_> ikarienator: here?
[10:57:45] <mikesherov_> No word from jeffmo or nzakas or michaelficarra?
[10:58:13] <mikesherov_> or gibson042?
[10:58:43] <mikesherov_> seems like skeleton crew... I suppose we need to get back to regular meeting if we expect the others to show up regularly!
[10:58:51] <ariya> indeed
[10:58:53] <mikesherov_> regularly* meeting
[10:59:06] <ariya> ikarienator is definitely busy and about to hit his paternity leave soon
[10:59:26] <mikesherov_> I see
[11:00:21] <ariya> shall we start?
[11:01:47] <mikesherov_> let's do it
[11:02:09] <ariya> I just landed two PRs
[11:02:13] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1180
[11:02:17] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1181
[11:02:36] <ariya> meanwhile, I spawned two generator-related tickets from the big generator PR
[11:02:45] <ariya> I think it's easier to discuss those issues separately
[11:02:52] <mikesherov_> Yes
[11:03:00] <ariya> I only need to address one more feedback from ikarienator, then it should be good to land
[11:03:05] <mikesherov_> Great
[11:03:13] <mikesherov_> when should we shoot for 2.3?
[11:03:22] <mikesherov_> JSCS is eagerly awaiting it :-)
[11:03:37] <ariya> if we can scope it only for 2.3, we should aim for next week
[11:03:45] <ariya> I mean scope 2.3 to generator only
[11:03:51] <mikesherov_> OK, that sounds good to me
[11:04:03] <mikesherov_> Contribution has slowed a bit
[11:04:05] <ariya> it's been 2 months without release, so let's just do that
[11:04:10] <mikesherov_> Myself included,
[11:04:41] <mikesherov_> Can we make a big push during jquerySF perhaps to meet and tackle remaining es6 stuff?
[11:04:48] <ariya> always like that approaching summer
[11:04:50] <mikesherov_> We had a goal by end of june...
[11:04:57] <mikesherov_> yes, I agree
[11:05:01] <ariya> also, delegate for Yield is now in EStree: https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/89
[11:05:18] <ariya> so we should be good at releasing generator impl, pending that one last feedback
[11:06:03] <ariya> mikesherov_: we can do quick hackathon at jquery sf
[11:06:11] <ariya> particularly to tackle corner cases
[11:06:11] <mikesherov_> would be fun
[11:06:24] <ariya> unless you want to dedicate the session only for CST, which is reasonable
[11:06:45] <mikesherov_> no, we should try to do both
[11:06:51] <mikesherov_> perhaps even mention it during our talk
[11:07:05] <mikesherov_> see if we can garner some interest from potential new contributors?
[11:07:11] <ariya> surething
[11:07:26] <ariya> I've sent the abstract BTW, sorry again for that fiasco
[11:08:12] <mikesherov_> No worries!
[11:08:18] <mikesherov_> gibson0421: you here now btw?
[11:08:25] <gibson0421> I am
[11:08:32] <ariya> w00t
[11:08:58] <gibson0421> shoot, only partially
[11:09:01] <ariya> do we know who will be at jquery sf?
[11:09:05] <gibson0421> I love doubling up on meetings ;)
[11:10:05] <arthurvr> Hey everybody - just tuning in, hi!
[11:10:41] <ariya> hi arthurvr
[11:11:42] <ariya> mikesherov_: do you fancy having JSCS in the bazaar? https://github.com/jQuerySF/Open-Source-Bazaar-2015
[11:13:10] <mikesherov_> Oh, great idea ariya
[11:13:36] <mikesherov_> ok, so takeaways from today is release 2.3 next week whatever it is
[11:13:51] <mikesherov_> and we're hacking at jQuerySF to see if we can make push for es6
[11:17:00] <ariya> anything else we shall discuss?
[11:18:32] <mikesherov_> nothing more from me
[11:18:58] <ariya> all right, that's about it then
[11:19:05] <ariya> thank you folks and see you next week!
[11:19:11] * ariya waves...
[11:19:46] <arthurvr> bye everyone
