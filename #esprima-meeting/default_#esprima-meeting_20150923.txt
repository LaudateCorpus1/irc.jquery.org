[11:02:34] <ariya> good morning/afternoon/evening!
[11:02:46] <arthurvr> Hey ariya :)
[11:02:58] <ariya> hi arthurvr
[11:03:45] <ariya> let's get started
[11:04:42] <arthurvr> nobody else here today?
[11:05:25] <ariya> poke jlast mikesherov
[11:05:32] <jlast> hello
[11:06:47] <ariya> hi gibson042
[11:06:53] <gibson042> hello
[11:07:35] <ariya> since last time
[11:09:11] <ariya> I implemented let as identifier
[11:09:12] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1289
[11:09:28] <ariya> meanwhile there is pending PR ready to review, on innerComment
[11:10:31] <ariya> also I think jlast was submitting a talk proposal on JavaScript AST to Fluent
[11:10:41] <ariya> gibson042: have you decided to go to Fluent or not? :-)
[11:11:03] <jlast> talk is submitted
[11:11:18] <gibson042> I haven't decided yet
[11:11:59] <ariya> esp if jlast is speaking there :-)
[11:12:21] <jlast> same for me :)
[11:12:36] <gibson042> yeah :)
[11:14:03] <ariya> token delegate: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1332
[11:14:14] <ariya> I have a working prototype for this, but I forgot to push the branch
[11:14:31] <ariya> jlast: this is needed for your editor highlighter plugin
[11:14:54] <jlast> yep - was thinking that. It's nice
[11:16:26] <ariya> I don't have anything else
[11:16:34] <ariya> Anyone else wants to discuss some topic?
[11:17:53] <jlast> nothing to report on the homepage.
[11:18:35] <ariya> ok, I think it's going to be another short meeting
[11:18:39] <jlast> hoping to get a free cycle next week to put together a prototype
[11:18:47] <ariya> thanks arthurvr for dropping by :-)
[11:18:52] <ariya> jlast: cool, keep us posted
[11:19:02] <ariya> thanks everyone, see you again next week!
