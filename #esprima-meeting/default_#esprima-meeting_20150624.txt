[11:02:29] <ariya> good morning/afternoon/evening
[11:03:34] <ariya> hi mikesherov ikarienator
[11:05:35] <michaelficarra> *clears throat*
[11:06:03] <michaelficarra> ... hi ariya
[11:06:07] <ariya> let's start, I'll be taking notes
[11:06:10] <ariya> michaelficarra: long time no see
[11:06:23] <ariya> since last week
[11:06:55] <ariya> * coveralls integration: https://coveralls.io/r/jquery/esprima
[11:07:30] <ariya> * npm payload minimzation
[11:07:56] <ariya> although this one break npat=true: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1199
[11:08:08] <ariya> some npm expert might want to help/take a look
[11:08:28] <ariya> * and of course, jQuery SF yesterday and the day before
[11:08:29] <michaelficarra> ariya: does anyone ever actually use that feature?
[11:08:48] <ariya> michaelficarra: npat? I assume yes cause I got that request long time ago
[11:08:53] <ariya> we may just say we don't care
[11:11:23] <ariya> jQuery SF: preso from me and mikesherov, generates new interest on JSCS
[11:11:24] <michaelficarra> we probably should
[11:11:34] <ariya> lots of other discussion around AST in general
[11:11:42] <ariya> michaelficarra: please chime in in the issue
[11:12:09] <ariya> we also have a good CST discussion, involving @getify @thejameskyle and few others
[11:12:24] <ariya> I believe mikesherov has all the notes and summary of the CST talks
[11:12:48] <michaelficarra> mikesherov: please post those CST notes ASAP
[11:13:49] <ariya> fun stuff: problem with the dead harmony branch https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1197
[11:13:56] <ariya> at least a workaround was established
[11:14:58] <ariya> next item: progress on 2.3
[11:15:01] <ariya> eh, 2.4
[11:15:07] <ariya> for-of: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1194
[11:15:24] <ariya> spread element: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1200
[11:15:42] <ariya> still need someone to +1 this PR: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1196
[11:16:30] <ariya> and ikarienator discovered https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1201
[11:18:48] <ariya> if that extra for-of in that PR 1196 is landed, we are good for 2.4
[11:19:01] <ariya> michaelficarra: new.target is supported in estree, right?
[11:19:06] <ariya> thus, we may not need to implement that
[11:19:13] <ariya> at least, not for now
[11:19:35] <michaelficarra> yeah, it's MetaProperty
[11:19:58] <ariya> ah you're right
[11:20:11] <ariya> https://github.com/estree/estree/issues/86
[11:20:47] <ariya> how's SM new NewTargetExpression change this?
[11:21:22] <ariya> somebody needs to read carefully https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1141865
[11:28:31] <michaelficarra> ariya: just read it, looks like they're going with NewTargetExpression
[11:28:32] <michaelficarra> see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8604282&action=diff&headers=0#a/js/src/jsast.tbl_sec1
[11:30:03] <ariya> bummer
[11:32:34] <ariya> that's all for now
[11:32:41] <ariya> I think we need to revisit that next week
[11:32:47] <michaelficarra> okay, bye
[11:34:07] <ariya> seeyou again next week!
