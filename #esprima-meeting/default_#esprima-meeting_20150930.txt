[11:01:09] <jlast> hey y'all, just a heads up that i won't be able to attend this weeks meeting. nothing to report on my end
[11:04:28] <ariya> hola everyone!
[11:04:35] <gibson042> hello!
[11:04:44] <ariya> let's get started
[11:05:28] <ariya> I was superbusy so it's been a quiet week for me
[11:05:40] <ariya> we found another let as identifier case: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1334
[11:05:45] <ariya> for (let in a) {}
[11:06:02] <ariya> feel free if someone wants to beat me to take a look at that :-)
[11:06:17] <ariya> innerComments PR is still to be reviewed
[11:06:27] <ariya> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1331
[11:06:34] <ariya> hopefully I have some time this week to do so
[11:07:15] <ariya> for token delegate, my experimental branch is at https://github.com/ariya/esprima/tree/token-delegate
[11:07:24] <ariya> jlast: if you want to have a sneak peek at that :-)
[11:08:07] <gibson042> ah, looks good
[11:08:33] <ariya> I still miss the tests
[11:08:41] <ariya> rather, still looking on how to test it properly
[11:10:20] <ariya> gibson042: are you thinking of coming to fluent?
[11:10:32] <ariya> jlast: mikesherov: I'll be in NY in 2 weeks for Velocity
[11:10:36] <ariya> in case any of you want to meet up
[11:11:20] <gibson042> Fluent is possible, but I probably won't know for sure until January
[11:12:21] <gibson042> ariya: 2 weeks? when is your arrival/departure?
[11:13:08] <ariya> Oct 12-14
[11:13:16] <ariya> http://velocityconf.com/devops-web-performance-ny-2015
[11:14:26] <gibson042> are you staying for any of the jQuery summit?
[11:14:41] <ariya> the fall event?
[11:14:50] <ariya> I was planning to, but I had to cancel it a few weeks ago
[11:15:10] <ariya> work related: customer deployment and such
[11:15:48] <gibson042> darn, I think I'll just miss you then
[11:16:14] <ariya> perhaps next time :-)
[11:16:27] <ariya> I have nothing else to discuss
[11:16:45] <ariya> let's see if I can meet either jlast or mikesherov in NY
[11:16:58] <ariya> 2.7 was scheduled for tomorrow, but I think I may postpone it a bit
[11:18:34] <ariya> that's about it folks
[11:18:46] <ariya> thanks everyone and see you again next week
[11:18:49] <ariya> bye gibson042
