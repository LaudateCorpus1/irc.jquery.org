[08:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov petersendidit tj_vantoll
[09:00:23] <jzaefferer> Nice to see those two numbers, tickets and PRs, go down
[09:01:09] <kborchers> hey
[09:01:13] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:20] <jperrault> hello
[09:02:38] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: Scott said you have updates for me to review - anything specific I should look for?
[09:03:16] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i finished fixing up the main branch from your recview
[09:03:26] <arschmitz> also created two new branches one for the focus outline
[09:03:41] <arschmitz> and one to support checkboxes wrapped in the label
[09:03:41] <fnagel> hey
[09:04:05] <jzaefferer> Okay. Its been so long, I can't remember any of the details. I'll check out the PR, tomorrow or so
[09:04:30] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: cool thank you the focus outline was what you had wanted to show keyboard focus
[09:04:33] <tj_vantoll> Here now.
[09:05:22] <rxaviers> here now
[09:05:24] <rxaviers> too
[09:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I was looking at calendar-wip again, and even the head of the branch has lots of failures.
[09:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> At this point, I'm fine destroying history and dealing with merge conflicts.
[09:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> I just need a clean branch to review.
[09:08:08] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: richt, as I said some more work is needed for the tests
[09:08:19] <fnagel> * right
[09:08:25] <scott_gonzalez> So if you want, I can work on squashing https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/commit/6363887e896c36ad9f2cc4bfa422fcdb230eff3a into the first commit.
[09:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> But I need to have passing tests the whole way through.
[09:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, it's really hard to do a proper review.
[09:09:11] <fnagel> Ok, you can do that
[09:09:32] <fnagel> I will fix the tests as soon as you are done
[09:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Does Globalize support non-Gregorian calendars? (sorry if I've asked this before)
[09:10:55] <rxaviers> It doesn't for now.
[09:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> But CLDR has the info?
[09:11:10] <rxaviers> not yet implemented
[09:11:14] <rxaviers> yeap, absolutely
[09:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:11:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to make sure we're supporting that in datepicker
[09:11:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5789
[09:11:43] <jzaefferer> Does it have info for the "broadcast calendar"?
[09:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice there are lots of duplicates.
[09:12:07] <rxaviers> broadcast calendar?
[09:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> Broadcast calendars are interesting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_calendar
[09:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> CLDR won't provide data for it because it's not a locale.
[09:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> But we should try to make the calendar widget have enough customization to support it.
[09:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> We still have three open regressions: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=!closed&keywords=~regression&report=40
[09:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> 10162 can't be fixed in 1.11.1 since the fix requires a breaking change.
[09:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> So that's why I say there are three.
[09:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Have you had a chance to look at any of these?
[09:15:29] <tj_vantoll> The resizable one has an open PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1280/files
[09:15:33] <scott_gonzalez> Or should we have other people start looking?
[09:18:23] <jzaefferer> Doesn't look like Mike's around
[09:18:45] <jzaefferer> Speaking of no response: What do we do about Bootstrap?
[09:20:09] <tj_vantoll> Speaking of no responseâ€¦ :)
[09:20:40] <tj_vantoll> I don't think there's much we can do other than pinging them.
[09:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> I just closed the PR.
[09:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> The fix was clearly wrong.
[09:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> I did ping them again this week.
[09:21:26] <scott_gonzalez> And Kris talked to the head of Open Source at Twitter.
[09:21:34] <rxaviers> Sorry about the delay... I'll take a deeper look at the broadcast calendar later and get back to you after the meeting, ok.
[09:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> So he's going to ping mdo as well.
[09:22:15] <kborchers> i will reach out again today or tomorrow and see where that's at
[09:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Thanks. I have a feeling the implementation will be inside the calendar widget, though it will probably still pull data from Globalize.
[09:22:33] <rxaviers> ok
[09:22:43] * rxaviers is kinda away today, packing stuff to flight back to BR.
[09:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to selectmenu.
[09:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> This week we had two complaints about not copying attributes from the original elements.
[09:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> One request to copy title attributes from options: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/consider-option-title-attribute-in-selectmenu
[09:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> One request to copy accesskey: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10435
[09:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery Mobile has a concept of degrading inputs (going from one type to another).
[09:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> They copy all attributes by cloning the HTML, but that would get tricky for us since we're chaning the element type.
[09:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., <select> to <span> and <option> to <li>
[09:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> So certain things won't be valid on the new elements.
[09:26:11] <arschmitz> yeah we just change the type attribute
[09:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> We could create a whitelist.
[09:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> But that seems like it could get out of control.
[09:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just tell users to build extensions.
[09:27:17] <tj_vantoll> Well if the whitelist were exposed people could add to it easier than building an extesion.
[09:27:36] <tj_vantoll> $.ui.selectmenu.prototype.copyAttributes.push( "whatever" );
[09:27:47] <fnagel> I think its reasonable to have a built in copy for attributes like accesskey
[09:28:01] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: thats essentially how degrade inputs work there is an object of types and what they degrade to
[09:28:03] <arschmitz> and its public
[09:28:07] <jzaefferer> fnagel: did you old implementation do that?
[09:28:21] <jzaefferer> *your
[09:28:23] <fnagel> mhh for classes but not for all attrributes
[09:28:32] <fnagel> peopled asked more about styling
[09:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> So what would we put in the array? Just accesskey and title?
[09:29:42] <tj_vantoll> I'm ok with that. They're both reasonable.
[09:29:42] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...we can't handle autofocus can we?
[09:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> Or does that work on all focusable elements?
[09:29:55] <fnagel> tj_vantoll: +1
[09:30:36] <jzaefferer> Would that even do anything for an element that's created in JS?
[09:31:17] <tj_vantoll> Off topic, but I have to leave for a different meeting. fyi I contacted Addy about meeting with the Chrome team about web components and compiled a list of talking points here: https://gist.github.com/tjvantoll/d3a4b57c70d3848ee7d5
[09:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Hmm...probably not if it's done after document ready.
[09:31:31] <tj_vantoll> Let me know who wants to be involved in that meeting.
[09:31:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Though it would affect a select inside a dialog ;-)
[09:31:41] <tj_vantoll> I'll be back online in a bit but I have to take off.
[09:34:03] <jzaefferer> This sounds like it would also work after the page was loaded: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#autofocusing-a-form-control:-the-autofocus-attribute
[09:34:20] <jzaefferer> The key being "When an element with the autofocus attribute specified is inserted into a document"
[09:34:26] <arschmitz> autofocus does not work on a div
[09:34:28] <jzaefferer> "inserted into a document"
[09:34:41] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/folor/1
[09:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's only valid for form elements.
[09:35:28] <arschmitz> yup
[09:35:42] <arschmitz> so no point in worrying about that
[09:35:55] <jzaefferer> Aren't we using a button?
[09:36:18] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:36:20] <jzaefferer> Nevermind
[09:37:13] <jzaefferer> Looks like that's all
[09:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I just looked through all attributes that apply to select and option.
[09:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can probably just hardcode these two.
[09:38:23] <jzaefferer> Seems fine
[09:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> If we get any legitimate requests for other attributes in the future, we can decide to add an extension point.
[09:38:47] <arschmitz> yeah if thats all that seems valid an extension point would seem pointless
[09:39:23] <jzaefferer> Got to go
[09:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Before you go...
[09:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have an objection to doing this for 1.12.0? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10131
[09:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hearing no objections, I'll set the milestone to 1.12.0.
[09:43:08] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
