[08:04:10] <jzaefferer> hey flore77
[08:04:16] <flore77> Hi
[08:04:19] <jzaefferer> time for another js-reporters meeting
[08:04:31] <flore77> yes
[08:04:36] <flore77> :)
[08:04:42] <jzaefferer> I guess no one else is joining? Need to check with them about an alternative meeting time
[08:05:09] <flore77> yes, I thing it would be good
[08:05:36] <flore77> think*
[08:06:35] <flore77> should I do a summary for the last week?
[08:07:38] <jzaefferer> yep, you can always start with that
[08:09:53] <flore77> I merged the getters refactor
[08:10:11] <flore77> fix a bug in the qunit adapter
[08:11:14] <flore77> fixed*
[08:11:34] <flore77> Added the testCounts property
[08:11:51] <flore77> which counts the tests (passed, failed, skipped and total)
[08:12:07] <flore77> also updated all rollup deps to the latest versions
[08:12:27] <flore77> then I got stuck because there is a problem with rollup-plugin-babel
[08:12:41] <flore77> which hold me back also for doing a new release
[08:12:55] <flore77> also started to add examples to readme
[08:13:19] <flore77> this for the js-reporters repo
[08:13:35] <flore77> I also rebased the events branch in QUnit
[08:13:51] <jzaefferer> I think QUnit ran into the same issue with rollup-babel, and they resolved it. Did you check out what they did?
[08:13:52] <flore77> so that we can start the native implemantation
[08:14:16] <flore77> I seen it, tremtwills has done a fix
[08:14:33] <flore77> but I hoped the rollup guys will fix it
[08:14:38] <jzaefferer> Btw. did that issue get introduced when you updated rollup?
[08:14:52] <flore77> no
[08:15:02] <flore77> it was later
[08:15:10] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[08:15:23] <flore77> when I merged that branch, everything was ok
[08:15:57] <flore77> I was worried not to broke something for who knows what browser version
[08:16:08] <flore77> by changing the bundling setup
[08:16:28] <flore77> that's why i preferred to wait for the fix in rollup
[08:16:38] <jzaefferer> "also started to add examples to readme" - that's not in a PR, yet, right?
[08:16:53] <flore77> no
[08:17:04] <flore77> it will be this week
[08:19:09] <flore77> and that's it
[08:20:02] <jzaefferer> ok
[08:20:49] <jzaefferer> Okay, so this week: Finish spec update; Add examples to README; Release adapters and update browserstack-runner, with testCounts
[08:20:51] <jzaefferer> Anything else?
[08:21:55] <flore77> no
[08:22:34] <flore77> I think we have a solid standard, maybe after that we can notify also Mocha to start working on the implemantation
[08:22:46] <flore77> as also Jasmine
[08:23:05] <jzaefferer> Oh, so about the QUnit implementation
[08:23:19] <jzaefferer> You rebased it on the ES6 modules, what's next there?
[08:23:40] <flore77> i didn't rebase it on the es6 module
[08:23:52] <jzaefferer> Ah, okay
[08:23:55] <flore77> I rebased it on the preivous master
[08:24:12] <flore77> thia week I will rebass it as well on top of the es6 module
[08:24:16] <jzaefferer> alright
[08:24:36] <flore77> then leobaltwr said that will make a complete review on that pr
[08:24:42] <flore77> leobalter*
[08:24:53] <flore77> this week
[08:25:19] <flore77> I don't know if he means, only reviewing the changes, or making a plan of what must be changed
[08:25:21] <jzaefferer> There (QUnit PR) was also some discussion about a TAP reporter. Could they use our implementation?
[08:25:36] <flore77> Yes, why not
[08:25:43] <jzaefferer> Can you bring that up?
[08:25:55] <flore77> sure!
[08:25:56] <jzaefferer> Would be a good test balloon
[08:26:15] <flore77> test ballon?
[08:26:18] <jzaefferer> I'm also interested in running our tests against their native implementation
[08:26:25] <jzaefferer> Well, just a good test, really
[08:27:06] <flore77> yes, we can run them
[08:28:00] <flore77> in js-reporters, no?
[08:28:27] <jzaefferer> However
[08:29:28] <flore77> ok. I will bring also that up
[08:32:08] <jzaefferer> Alright, thanks
[08:32:17] <flore77> also check this please
[08:32:18] <jzaefferer> Let's finish the spec update now? I'm around a little longer
[08:32:19] <flore77> https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/pull/84#discussion_r73350749
[08:32:25] <jzaefferer> ok, looking
[08:32:48] <flore77> I will finish it
[08:33:00] <flore77> but I am in middle of London from my phone :))
[08:33:34] <jzaefferer> heh, okay
[08:34:39] <flore77> this week we should finish with the spec, for sure
[08:36:29] <jzaefferer> Responded on the PR
[08:41:53] <flore77> yes, I got it now
[08:42:06] <flore77> I will update
[08:42:19] <flore77> because now Mocha for assertions emitts a void array
[08:42:56] <flore77> always
