[12:04:52] <bethge> Hi
[12:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, getting pulled into other converstaions.
[12:10:20] <bethge> no problem
[12:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> So the W3C test download breaking was probably my fault.
[12:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that broke when I upgraded dependencies.
[12:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> And since I had an existing directory, I didn't get an error.
[12:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> But that fix was merged, so we're good now :-)
[12:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/301
[12:11:54] <bethge> Ok sweet. At first I didn't notice either. Not even sure how I worked before. jdalton did some lodash magic
[12:12:14] <bethge> s/how I/how it/
[12:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm assuming that API changed.
[12:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, thanks for fixing it :-)
[12:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> We also had a PR from a community member to forward modifier keys from touch events.
[12:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> I filed a bug based on the PR: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/304
[12:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> And the PR was merged this morning: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/300
[12:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> Which brings us to the mouseup outside of the window problem: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/279
[12:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> Which bethge has a PR for: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/297
[12:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> I like the number shuffling between the issue and the PR :-) 279...297
[12:15:06] <bethge> :D
[12:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> This should handle all of #279, right?
[12:17:01] <bethge> Yeah, mostly. Except for if the user does some odd 2 button click or something :)
[12:17:15] <bethge> And only release one of them
[12:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> We're not firing the up event though, right?
[12:18:49] <bethge> No, since, I believe, mouse doesn't fire one either
[12:18:54] <bethge> should we?
[12:19:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think so.
[12:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise you'll could get two down events without an up between them.
[12:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> For the same pointer id.
[12:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> Right, mouse doesn't fire one, but that's what the bug is ;-)
[12:20:10] <bethge> Oh, I was wondering about that
[12:21:11] <bethge> Mouseup doesn't get fired I if the mouse up is outside of the document. I was just mirroring that
[12:21:36] <bethge> I am curious how edge and chrome are approaching, like is this mentioned in the spec or anywhere?
[12:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> Right, and this has historically caused a lot of pain.
[12:22:35] <scott_gonzalez> This is why we have this code in jQuery UI: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/mouse.js#L73-L83
[12:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> If we get a down event and we're already tracking the mouse, then we know we missed an up, so we have to behave as if up happened.
[12:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> And then right after that process the new down event.
[12:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need the same thing for pointer.
[12:25:53] <bethge> I see what you mean. Would you say we should fire an pointerup event in this situation, eventhough chrome / Edge does not?
[12:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, they don't?
[12:27:03] <bethge> Hmm... let me double check, I might be testing wrong. I am checking on chrome with pe activated
[12:31:31] <bethge> It doesn't look like Chrome does. Behaves just like mouse.
[12:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:31:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess this is fine then.
[12:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we can get the browsers to eventually fire the evnets.
[12:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> But if they're not doing it now, then we certainly don't need to.
[12:33:30] <bethge> Yeah, I wonder if, in an application code, one can check pointerenter for the buttons property, once the pointer reenters the document
[12:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you can certainly just hammer on it like we do in jQuery UI :-)
[12:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> After pointerdown, just listen to all pointermove events and see if buttons is 0.
[12:37:09] <bethge> :D
[12:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> If it is and you haven't gotten pointerup, you know the browser just never fired it.
[12:37:32] <bethge> Pointermove, every performance advocates best friend :D
[12:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> So, I guess this is good to merge, then?
[12:43:06] <bethge> I hope :)
[12:44:07] <bethge> For Chrome, https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/282 already updated our buttons state, such that the pointermove are correct.
[12:46:43] <bethge> I am actually having a hard time missing an mouse up with chrome canary. It is only missing if the mousedown fires an alert: http://jsbin.com/neweyesoso/edit?html,js,console,output
[12:48:15] <scott_gonzalez> That's good, actually.
[12:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, it's not GOOD, but it's better than missing it when going out of the window.
[12:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's more of an old IE problem.
[12:49:25] <bethge> Probably. Safari also receives those mouseup events. Seems quite a special case with an alert
[12:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, native modal windows in browsers are whacky.
[12:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> The other day I noticed in Chrome if you click on a file input field and then open a new tab, the file dialog stays open even in the new tab and you can't interact until you close it.
[12:52:27] <bethge> Meh. We need first-class browser tabs!
[12:53:17] <bethge> With the advent of progressive web apps, it's about time for the browser to keep up ;)
[12:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[12:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so go ahed and merge that PR then :-)
[12:56:10] <bethge> Ok, will do
[12:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> And that brings us to the last thing I have on the agenda...
[12:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome's release of Pointer Events behind a flag :-)
[12:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/303
[12:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[12:56:31] <bethge> \o/ \o/
[12:56:56] <bethge> Really nice
[12:58:30] <bethge> Now Safari would be the only one missing. And afaik it is not even listed for Safari 10, coming in fall
[12:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[12:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> They still have not shown any interest in implementing.
[12:59:30] <bethge> They just love their touch events and their very limited mouse events ;-)
[13:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:01:59] <sfrisk_> ha
[13:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess that's all for today.
[13:04:40] <bethge> Yeah. Thanks!
[14:02:59] <cogwurx> Hello!

[14:16:40] <apsdehal> In this one, we decided to add info to docs
[14:16:48] <apsdehal> Do we require that now?
[14:17:02] <apsdehal> I mean is it really the important?
[14:17:04] <arschmitz> we should have a docs issue

[14:17:26] <apsdehal> Ok, I will add a docs issue
[14:18:02] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7535
[14:20:26] <apsdehal> ^ No jqm member comments, views?
[14:20:31] <apsdehal> Should we add this?
[14:24:02] <apsdehal> arschmitz: ^
[14:24:12] <arschmitz> reading
[14:24:38] <arschmitz> sounds like a bug we should fix
[14:25:50] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7682
[14:26:04] <apsdehal> We need to take a final decision on this one, else I can close this
[14:30:06] <apsdehal> arschmitz: ^
[14:31:58] <arschmitz> if we cant show where its wrong we should remove and close
