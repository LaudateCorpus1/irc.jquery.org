[14:09:49] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting time!
[14:09:54] <arthurvr> o/
[14:10:55] <sfrisk> arthurvr, arschmitz, geekman-rohit, kristyjy
[14:11:10] <arschmitz> hi
[14:11:15] <kristyjy> hello
[14:12:22] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:13:28] <sfrisk> so first off, the jquery dev summit went well last week
[14:13:38] <sfrisk> we did have some interest from the community and people willing to commit
[14:14:06] <sfrisk> some of the smaller PRs that can out of that I pulled in, although there are a few left that needed review or were works in progress
[14:15:07] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/132 -- Added notes about using 'grunt watch' when developing and added some bash syntax highlighting to the readme
[14:16:24] <sfrisk> I have some wording changes I am in the process of suggesting regarding the usefulness of the 'watch' task for grunt, which I will post momentarily
[14:20:35] <sfrisk> which is taking me longer to write out than I thought it was
[14:21:14] <sfrisk> mostly it's just changing the wording to explain that the grunt watch tasks helps automate the compiling of SCSS files on file change
[14:22:38] <sfrisk> Work was also started on table styling and typography
[14:23:51] <geekman-rohit> i dont realy think github flavored markdown syntax highlights bash
[14:24:04] <sfrisk> eh, not too much, but it's done in other projects
[14:24:51] <sfrisk> I kinda sat down and looked at a bunch of open source readmes to see if they were doing it when alexrqs suggested it
[14:26:14] <geekman-rohit> i kinda am doing the same
[14:26:25] <geekman-rohit> i dont really see bash anywhere in there repo
[14:26:29] <geekman-rohit> their*
[14:27:48] <sfrisk> I'm trying to remember which one I was looking at
[14:28:34] <sfrisk> I know npm uses ```sh
[14:28:52] <arthurvr> GitHub nor NPM does highlight bash or `sh`
[14:29:03] <arthurvr>  so I honestly donâ€™t see the reason to have it
[14:29:13] <sfrisk> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npm/npm/master/README.md
[14:29:16] <arthurvr> Also it might not be bash or sh but the windows prompts for example
[14:29:17] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml
[14:29:32] <geekman-rohit> the list of supported languages, actually there is a bash in there
[14:30:23] <sfrisk> might be good practice to have it in there, even if there is no visual difference, so there is some indication that we are talking about the command line
[14:32:22] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:32:22] <sfrisk> also, kristyjy - on the scss style guide
[14:33:14] <sfrisk> something that occurred to me over the summit was that it may be useful to include either on that style guide, or elsewhere some best practices for JSASS variables
[14:33:21] <kristyjy> sorry bunch of people just started talking to me lol
[14:33:33] <sfrisk> since this was something I found myself explaining a few times over the weekend
[14:34:12] <sfrisk> not sure if we want to put that in the SCSS style guide (since SCSS uses the variables generated by JSASS), or put it in it's own document
[14:35:35] <geekman-rohit> in its own document sounds good
[14:35:48] <geekman-rohit> actually
[14:35:58] <geekman-rohit> would make more sense to have it in jsass repo
[14:36:04] <kristyjy> I agree I think it should be it's own document
[14:36:20] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz?
[14:36:42] <sfrisk> https://github.com/arschmitz/JSass-vars is an arschmitz thing
[14:37:08] <sfrisk> but I think our project might have best practices compared to how other people might use jsass-vars
[14:38:01] <arschmitz> sorry got pulled away
[14:38:06] <sfrisk> that's okay
[14:38:39] <geekman-rohit> well since we want to push best practices
[14:38:49] <geekman-rohit> would make sense to have a bunch of them
[14:39:00] <geekman-rohit> a file for class names, for instance
[14:39:05] <arschmitz> +1
[14:39:22] <sfrisk> class names, grouping vars, naming conventions
[14:39:59] <geekman-rohit> we dont really use bem anymore.. or has that changed ?
[14:40:14] <sfrisk> BE   M
[14:40:16] <geekman-rohit> ive not been able to attend for more than a month
[14:40:28] <sfrisk> to be fair, there hasn't really been a meeting in a month
[14:40:35] <sfrisk> everyone got hit with work
[14:40:48] <geekman-rohit> well .. we wont get any benefits of bem as long as theres multiple classes in html
[14:41:03] <geekman-rohit> so be m !== bem
[14:41:11] <sfrisk> we won't have the cascading, and the class name will still indicate the block and element
[14:41:31] <sfrisk> but instead of memorizing modifier order, it will be it's own class
[14:41:56] <geekman-rohit> bem would have technically just one class, so one bunch of css
[14:42:15] <sfrisk> that's why I had a space in BE    M
[14:42:23] <geekman-rohit> in be m we will have multiple classes
[14:42:26] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:42:33] <sfrisk> so we're taking aspects of BEM
[14:42:41] <geekman-rohit> so even with that we avoid cascading?
[14:42:44] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:43:26] <sfrisk> you'll have <button class="ui-btn ui-btn-large ui-btn-active">Active Button</button>
[14:43:31] <geekman-rohit> im lost
[14:43:49] <sfrisk> cascading is referring to depending on the surrounding html structure
[14:43:49] <geekman-rohit> but ui-btn-large eill override some of css from ui-btn
[14:43:59] <geekman-rohit> still**
[14:44:25] <sfrisk> so we won't have anything that is going   .ui-btn-group .ui-btn { some classes here }
[14:44:36] <geekman-rohit> the largest benefit with bem would have been having one single class in html, so faster rendering in browsers, I guess
[14:44:43] <geekman-rohit> though the faster would be negligible
[14:45:08] <sfrisk> yeah, and we're still avoiding cascading and forcing html structure
[14:45:16] <sfrisk> just elements might have multiple classes on them
[14:45:52] <geekman-rohit> umm,, we will need a good style guide for that too
[14:46:04] <geekman-rohit> oh sorry, that would be part of scss
[14:46:09] <sfrisk> yup
[14:46:24] <sfrisk> I mean the jQuery CSS guide already has stuff about trying to avoid cascading
[14:46:29] <sfrisk> but we'll be stricter about it
[14:47:13] <sfrisk> Okay, I need to get back to work
[14:47:15] <kristyjy> yeah that's one of the edits I've been working on for the SCSS style guide. I want to try to be clear about how we are using BEM
[14:47:28] <kristyjy> or BE M lol
[14:47:33] <sfrisk> BE               M
[14:47:35] <sfrisk> MMMM
[14:47:48] <sfrisk> Okay, so I need to get back to work, getting pulled into a meeting
[14:48:07] <geekman-rohit> okay :D
[14:48:09] <sfrisk> Real quick, need a PR to remove the '^' in the grunt-html version requirements
[14:48:18] <sfrisk> I can do that tonight if no one else grabs it
[14:48:28] <sfrisk> I swear, something for the new buttons pr will be up next week
[14:48:28] <geekman-rohit> im free tonight
[14:48:34] <sfrisk> :-D
[14:48:59] <sfrisk> okay, see everyone later
[14:49:02] <geekman-rohit> I been swearing that for meter for 2 months
[14:49:34] <sfrisk> or in chassis chat
[14:49:35] <geekman-rohit> theres diwali next month, i get 10 days off
[14:49:40] <sfrisk> and nanowrimo
[14:49:40] <geekman-rohit> see ya
