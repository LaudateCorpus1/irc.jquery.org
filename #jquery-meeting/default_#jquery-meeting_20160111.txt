[12:00:19] <DaveMethvin> looks like I need to put out a new jquery-migrate!
[12:00:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol, markelog https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhcW9_TlSwD8JnO1_HNnSYJAriTK9WYZ8uQNDvtAAhA/edit#
[12:01:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yakadoo
[12:01:10] <markelog> hey-hey!
[12:01:20] <DaveMethvin> i'll look at that bug just reported
[12:01:43] <markelog> what is up with our 2.2/1.12?
[12:01:47] <markelog> stable, all good?
[12:02:02] <timmywil> looks like it
[12:02:18] <timmywil> no issues still open
[12:02:43] <timmywil> Docs are in
[12:02:50] <timmywil> Just need a migrate release
[12:02:58] <markelog> cool!
[12:03:18] <markelog> seems it should be a good one
[12:03:21] <markelog> fingers cross
[12:03:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah either it's pretty clean or nobody is using it yet!
[12:03:48] <timmywil> I committed the new Sizzle, had to enable an ascii-only option in uglify to get an unobtrusive charset for our jquery.min.js
[12:03:57] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yup!
[12:04:01] <m_gol> present
[12:04:24] <markelog> it is like giving a talk and no question at the end
[12:04:31] <markelog> either you did a great job
[12:04:35] <markelog> or no one cares
[12:04:40] <timmywil> ha
[12:05:38] <m_gol> I've seen a CanJS problem with hiding some private methods but they're OK now
[12:05:40] <timmywil> gibson will be absent today, but he's got a PR for show/hide!
[12:06:19] <markelog> i'm not sure if i get that pr
[12:06:24] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: the last blocker is assigned to you
[12:06:28] <markelog> it seems there is no iframe hack
[12:06:40] <markelog> and no ff hack for body/html elements
[12:07:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah i think i should be able to get to that today
[12:07:23] <timmywil> markelog: good comment for the PR
[12:07:42] <markelog> we also need to extensively test this and compare to that table
[12:08:02] <markelog> of expected displays
[12:08:07] <timmywil> markelog: perhaps the old default display tests are still there?
[12:08:41] <markelog> i remember gibson removed those
[12:08:47] <timmywil> ok
[12:08:53] <markelog> not sure though :)
[12:08:58] <timmywil> comment on the PR since he's not here
[12:09:17] <markelog> will do
[12:09:20] <markelog> we are planning to release beta right?
[12:09:23] <markelog> not the final?
[12:09:33] <timmywil> I was planning on final
[12:10:02] <m_gol> I think it's risky
[12:10:08] <m_gol> we had one alpha
[12:10:14] <DaveMethvin> for 3.0 maybe we should do a beta
[12:10:16] <m_gol> with significant differences
[12:10:17] <markelog> yeah, no beta
[12:10:20] <m_gol> half a year ago
[12:10:28] <markelog> i mean, we didn't release a beta, only alpha
[12:10:43] <markelog> still should be pretty good for 12 january )
[12:10:50] <markelog> and 14 we gonna release final!
[12:10:52] <timmywil> yea, I'm skeptical how much info we'd get from a beta
[12:10:55] <DaveMethvin> also, migrate isn't ready for the matching 3.0
[12:11:00] <markelog> )
[12:11:07] <m_gol> we don't get a lot of feedback but I think we get some
[12:11:22] <markelog> show/hide, raf... what else important there?
[12:11:26] <timmywil> sounds like I'm the only one opposed. We'll do a beta then.
[12:11:30] <DaveMethvin> promise changes
[12:11:30] <m_gol> also, some people have bower/npm setups and it's hard for them to test non-released versions from master so no beta = no possibility of feedback grom them
[12:11:40] <markelog> for alpha we received a lot of comments for show/hide
[12:11:57] <timmywil> we'll do beta
[12:12:13] <timmywil> especially since migrate isn't ready
[12:12:16] <DaveMethvin> i think we were talking about an announcement on the 14th?
[12:12:30] <markelog> 12 was it?
[12:12:33] <timmywil> Microsoft will announce that we're dropping IE8 support on the 12th
[12:12:41] <DaveMethvin> oh i had the wrong date
[12:12:45] <markelog> and 14 is jQuery birthday
[12:12:47] <timmywil> but we don't have to release tomorrow
[12:13:18] <markelog> it seems we can though, right?
[12:13:26] <m_gol> yeah, we can put up a blog post if a release isn't ready
[12:13:27] <markelog> not sure about the show/hide
[12:13:29] <DaveMethvin> i shoudl be able to get my blocker done
[12:13:36] <timmywil> not without the show/hide PR and the when + progress stuff
[12:13:39] <m_gol> markelog: depends on the state of gibson's PR...
[12:13:40] <markelog> but everything else is pretty much good
[12:13:47] <markelog> yeah, yeah, see above
[12:13:49] <timmywil> yea
[12:13:52] <m_gol> which I don't see landing tomorrow given the review needed
[12:13:59] <timmywil> maybe the 14th
[12:14:03] <m_gol> ;)
[12:14:10] <DaveMethvin> the blog post can say a beta is coming soon
[12:14:12] <timmywil> would be fun to release on jQuery's birthday
[12:14:12] <markelog> we can annonce on 12 and release on 14
[12:14:19] <DaveMethvin> the 14th is a big date, we should try to make that
[12:14:29] <timmywil> agreed
[12:14:37] <markelog> seems like a good move!
[12:14:45] <timmywil> and since we're doing a beta, I'm only concerned about the 2 blockers that are left
[12:15:05] <timmywil> we can finish up the less pressing stuff for final
[12:15:16] <markelog> show/hide is pretty much one the table
[12:15:31] <markelog> i would also suggest to show the table of expected displays in the blog post
[12:15:56] <markelog> and probably in the docs
[12:16:17] <timmywil> while that's useful info, need to strike a balance between informative and interesting
[12:16:17] <m_gol> it might be too much for the blog post
[12:16:42] <markelog> a table?
[12:16:54] <timmywil> I mean, would you pause to read that?
[12:16:55] <markelog> we could update the docs and mention it in the blog post
[12:17:17] <timmywil> docs yea
[12:17:33] <DaveMethvin> it should be somewhere for reference, i wonder if we should wait until we're sure we're putting it in before committing it to api.jquery.com
[12:17:44] <markelog> exactly
[12:17:47] <DaveMethvin> this bug is pissing me off https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/128
[12:17:48] <markelog> need to check gibson pr
[12:17:58] <DaveMethvin> $( "<a>" ).outerWidth();
[12:18:49] <markelog> does it only happen with migrate?
[12:18:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:19:06] <DaveMethvin> remove it from "External Resources" and it "works"
[12:19:20] <DaveMethvin> it's a DUMB thing to ask for
[12:20:00] <markelog> it sure is!
[12:20:15] <timmywil> I'm confused. It should still work, tho, right?
[12:20:17] <DaveMethvin> i guess the latest UI still has this altho master does not
[12:20:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah, somehow there is no defaultView
[12:20:48] <DaveMethvin> oh well, i'll take a deeper look
[12:20:56] <DaveMethvin> really should fix that before doing a new release of Migrate
[12:21:01] <timmywil> oh, it's cause UI removed something on master (not even released)?
[12:21:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah the code causing the problem is a call to outerWidth from within UI
[12:21:29] <markelog> hm, how could it happens only with migrate i wonder
[12:21:29] <DaveMethvin> he  just pulled the code out to reduce it
[12:21:35] <DaveMethvin> GOOD QUESTION :)
[12:21:41] <timmywil> weird
[12:21:53] <timmywil> well, it's probably something easy
[12:22:05] <DaveMethvin> must be in the constructor for $("<a>") though
[12:22:11] <DaveMethvin> since migrate  hooks that
[12:22:24] <DaveMethvin> the elements it returns must not be the same
[12:22:25] <markelog> also happens with $("<a>1</a>")
[12:22:26] <timmywil> For https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2796, what's the proposed docs change? That context will be ignored for pos selectors?
[12:22:30] <markelog> which is a different path
[12:23:06] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i guess we'd only use it for the upward-path limit?
[12:23:40] <timmywil> right, but "A DOM element within which a matching element may be found." doesn't sound that different
[12:24:03] <DaveMethvin> true, really we're just documenting a bug we aren't fixing
[12:24:10] <DaveMethvin> that is, it's not a rooted selector
[12:24:36] <markelog> so... removal?
[12:24:45] <DaveMethvin> can't be removed i think
[12:24:53] <DaveMethvin> just don't use it for pos selectors
[12:24:58] <DaveMethvin> but keep it in otherwise
[12:25:36] <timmywil> oh, I see the difference now
[12:25:55] <timmywil> Kinda like qsa's scope
[12:26:07] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:26:31] <timmywil> Oh, there's already a docs issue. ha
[12:26:44] <timmywil> I just wanted to know what to say when opening one, so I could close this.
[12:27:16] <DaveMethvin> we need to remove the context in the pos selectors though
[12:27:28] <timmywil> :P
[12:27:32] <DaveMethvin> so that's a code change ... unless we don't want to do that
[12:28:12] <timmywil> ok, updated
[12:28:22] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[12:28:47] <timmywil> Lastly, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2737 Anything stopping us from landing?
[12:29:00] <DaveMethvin> nope
[12:29:07] <DaveMethvin> i have the plugin as well
[12:29:08] <timmywil> hooray!
[12:29:17] <timmywil> I'll add to the blog post
[12:29:30] <markelog> i would land it, but closely look how people would react on this
[12:29:45] <m_gol> timmywil: why do we still keep the full built jQuery in the tag? Is jquery-dist usage only planned for 3.0.0?
[12:30:01] <timmywil> m_gol: we're already using it
[12:30:25] <timmywil> we don't need the dist in the tag, but the release script will need updating
[12:30:33] <m_gol> so why keep the built files in detached tags as well? one of the reasons to move was to not bloat the main repo
[12:30:34] <m_gol> k
[12:30:47] <DaveMethvin> the tag doesn't have built artifacts in the main repo does it?
[12:30:51] <m_gol> I'll create an issue
[12:30:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it does
[12:30:58] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah it does
[12:30:59] <timmywil> it still does
[12:31:30] <markelog> is that bad or something?
[12:31:46] <m_gol> it bloats the repo and requires detached tags
[12:31:47] <timmywil> not terrible, but unnecessary
[12:31:55] <m_gol> ideally we'd just tag a commit in the main tree
[12:31:59] <m_gol> * in the main line
[12:32:05] <timmywil> yea, I can fix that for 3.0
[12:32:08] <markelog> it shouldn't bloat it that much
[12:32:13] <markelog> since git uses compressions algos
[12:32:23] <markelog> and all that code is already in the repo
[12:32:27] <timmywil> I don't think the change will be that hard
[12:32:31] <m_gol> it's also confusing; people look for tags but if you specifically don't fetch for tags you only get ones that are lying on the branch
[12:32:47] <timmywil> m_gol: assign that issue to me :)
[12:32:53] <DaveMethvin> longer term if we start using other transforms on the code (e.g., ES6 modules) it will be more bloaty in the -dist repo so i'm glad we're doing this step now
[12:32:54] <m_gol> ESLint changed their release script because people were complaining about that
[12:33:01] <m_gol> timmywil: ok :)
[12:33:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: good point
[12:33:40] <timmywil> ok, plenty to do, but I think discussions can continue in tickets. Anything else for the meeting?
[12:33:45] <markelog> yeah
[12:33:51] <markelog> small thing though
[12:33:54] <m_gol> timmywil: one thing
[12:34:01] <timmywil> fire away
[12:34:06] <markelog> m_gol: you first
[12:34:09] <m_gol> were all milestones for 1.12/2.2 moved as needed?
[12:34:14] <m_gol> or is there sth left to do here?
[12:34:25] <timmywil> DaveMethvin took care of that
[12:34:44] <timmywil> might need a second look
[12:34:53] <DaveMethvin> I *think* i got them all but another review is welcome!
[12:34:58] <markelog> DaveMethvin: how did you do it?
[12:35:04] <markelog> with the release script?
[12:35:11] <timmywil> manually
[12:35:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah it was too messed up for me to do it manually with the reverts etc
[12:35:30] <markelog> hm, it seems release script would be more thorough
[12:35:32] <m_gol> because I see some 3.0.0 issues/PRs that should have 1.12/2.2 IMO
[12:35:54] <timmywil> m_gol: then they probably still need updating
[12:35:58] <DaveMethvin> if they're in 1.12/2.2 feel free to update
[12:36:03] <m_gol> k, I'll see what I can find
[12:36:11] <markelog> okay, my turn
[12:36:20] <markelog> why do we have these
[12:36:21] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/dabd5ba96c05279b3ffb052db5b8d17f75996694/src/core/ready.js#L61-L62
[12:36:22] <markelog> ?
[12:36:57] <timmywil> to remove handlers that might have been added
[12:37:10] <markelog> they were added
[12:37:17] <markelog> but why do we want to remove them?
[12:37:24] <timmywil> no longer needed
[12:37:41] <markelog> but they will no create a error situation
[12:37:45] <timmywil> better to not leave around unecessary events
[12:37:52] <markelog> nor they take a lot of memory
[12:38:01] <timmywil> still, I'd prefer the cleanup
[12:38:12] <markelog> i'm not sure how it would benefit us or the end-user
[12:38:29] <markelog> it could simplify the code though
[12:38:37] <markelog> and decrease the size
[12:38:39] <timmywil> I think that's bikeshedding a bit.
[12:38:50] <markelog> i see two points for removal
[12:38:55] <markelog> size and simplification
[12:39:00] <markelog> which seems objective
[12:39:07] <timmywil> it's not much of either
[12:39:08] <markelog> don't see the reasons for them staying though
[12:39:18] <DaveMethvin> i seem to recall someone making the case for adding, need to go back through the blame to find the discussion tho
[12:39:59] <markelog> i just wonder how it could help anyone?
[12:40:23] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/dbf4926e31390ceda57730c68d40f34536803114
[12:40:26] <timmywil> I'm not sure that's the right question. There's not a compelling enough reason not to do it.
[12:40:34] <DaveMethvin> markelog added it :)
[12:40:48] <markelog> no-no, i have made it consistent )
[12:40:56] <DaveMethvin> haha ok
[12:41:00] <markelog> before, only one event was removed
[12:41:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah but you proposed removing both https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1135
[12:42:04] <DaveMethvin> oh rwaldron did
[12:42:04] <markelog> i have presented the options )
[12:42:12] <markelog> rwaldron choose it
[12:42:18] <DaveMethvin> i like the clean option myself
[12:42:27] <m_gol> me too
[12:42:34] <markelog> yeah, it seems as i right thing to do
[12:42:35] <timmywil> I think you're outvoted markelog
[12:42:35] <markelog> but why?
[12:42:38] <m_gol> better not to stack memory leaks one each other
[12:42:48] <markelog> couldn't be a memory leak
[12:42:48] <m_gol> small leaks tend to aggregate
[12:42:49] <timmywil> sets a better precedent anyway
[12:43:15] <timmywil> it's just good practice. You'd have to make a strong argument to leave them, not the other way around.
[12:43:28] <markelog> actually no one removing events
[12:43:36] <markelog> while page is still used
[12:43:45] <markelog> i.e. update
[12:43:46] <markelog> d
[12:44:00] <markelog> like you would add event for "click"
[12:44:04] <markelog> but rarely remove it
[12:44:23] <markelog> and that could be a memory leak
[12:44:28] <markelog> since action is not repeated
[12:44:31] <timmywil> I think we can find other places in the code to simplify that are more important.
[12:44:35] <markelog> *couldn't
[12:44:54] <markelog> i just wonder why
[12:45:02] <DaveMethvin> just to keep things clean
[12:45:30] <markelog> okay-okay, gonna stop pressuring )
[12:45:38] <timmywil> I want lunch :)
[12:45:58] <markelog> i'm done!
[12:46:11] <DaveMethvin> i'll look at my two tickets so we can ship!
[12:46:24] <m_gol> who will mute the channel?
[12:46:30] <markelog> need to check gibson pr
[12:46:33] <markelog> i will do it
[12:46:38] <timmywil> thanks
[12:46:46] <timmywil> see you in -dev!
[12:46:47] <markelog> but if someone could help
[12:46:52] <markelog> that would be great
[12:46:56] <timmywil> I'll take a look too
[12:47:04] <markelog> ok-ok
[12:47:10] <timmywil> laterz
[12:47:13] <markelog> see ya
