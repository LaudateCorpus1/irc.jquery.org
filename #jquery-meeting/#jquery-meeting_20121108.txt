[10:02:24] <rworth_> hey
[10:02:26] <ajpiano> hey!
[10:02:39] <bentonam> hows it going?
[10:02:56] <ajpiano> pretty well!!
[10:03:03] <agcolom> Hi!
[10:03:06] <rworth_> looks like we need to get this meeting added to the topic
[10:03:11] <ajpiano> can everyone who's here for this just give a quick headsup
[10:03:23] <jorydotcom> headsup!
[10:03:42] <ajpiano> uch now it's too long
[10:04:06] <ajpiano> phew.
[10:04:07] <rworth_> nice
[10:04:29] <danheberden> should just add (all times EST)
[10:04:33] <ajpiano> yea
[10:04:40] <ajpiano> we can OPTIMIZE LATER
[10:05:12] <ajpiano> so welcome to this first jquery content meeting
[10:05:38] <danheberden> i'm very content being here
[10:05:52] <johnkpaul> it's EST now? or EDT?
[10:05:56] <ajpiano> in general i want this to just be a clearinghouse for any teams working on content to be able to drill through their own issues for the week, and then discuss any cross project content/style issue
[10:06:01] <danheberden> johnkpaul: aye, should just be "ET"
[10:06:07] <rworth_> indeed
[10:06:17] <danheberden> and yeah, EST now
[10:06:59] <ajpiano> for now what i'm actually hoping to go through from my end is getting ready to ship the learning site
[10:07:07] <buritica> yes!
[10:07:12] <jorydotcom> woo!
[10:07:12] <kborchers> here … late :)
[10:07:18] <ajpiano> we have scheduled a tentative date of NEXT FRIDAY
[10:07:24] <ajpiano> to ship Something!
[10:07:30] <johnkpaul> capital S
[10:08:08] <jorydotcom> go-go-gadget ship?
[10:08:12] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues?milestone=1&page=1&state=open
[10:08:34] <ajpiano> there are some big picture things that need to come together before it can be presentable
[10:08:53] <ajpiano> which is mostly captured in this milestone
[10:09:08] <ajpiano> and largely style/structure related
[10:09:18] <johnkpaul> 31 is waiting on me to fix up the styles of the commit in web-base-template
[10:09:39] <johnkpaul> after the merge, there were styling issues
[10:09:44] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: do you think you could help out with generally any stuff related to web-base-template and learn
[10:09:54] <ajpiano> i'm going to be working on getting a homepage together abit
[10:10:16] <ajpiano> bue #173 would be good too
[10:10:33] <jorydotcom> As I'm working through the style conformance issue, I'm pulling a lot of stuff that relates to #180 and #137
[10:10:49] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: yeah, I will be working on the web base template PR for learn #31 tomorrow
[10:10:51] <ajpiano> jorydotcom: yeah, i figured, should i just assign those to you
[10:10:56] <johnkpaul> what are the other WBT issues?
[10:10:56] <jorydotcom> kk
[10:11:31] <ajpiano> jorydotcom: one thing i need to file is that we will probably need to support more than one level of navigation
[10:11:33] <ajpiano> in the sidebar
[10:11:47] <jorydotcom> yes, agree
[10:12:00] <ajpiano> there's an issue for it on grunt-jquery-content to support htat
[10:12:05] <ajpiano> but it also needs to be supported in the theme
[10:12:17] <ajpiano> rworth_: one thing i'm kind of unsure of is where the best place to track things like that is
[10:12:23] <ajpiano> in the content repo, or in web base template
[10:12:38] <ajpiano> cc jzaefferer scott_gonzalez but i know he is not around
[10:12:39] <buritica> I can take #137 over the weekend, is that then the most recent pockup?
[10:12:47] <buritica> *mockup
[10:12:55] <ajpiano> buritica: yep
[10:13:07] <buritica> 404
[10:13:09] <ajpiano> well
[10:13:12] <ajpiano> argh
[10:13:22] <ajpiano> there's another WBT task that isn't quite tracked here
[10:13:32] <ajpiano> which is that we need to convert over to web-base-template's "new-css" branch
[10:13:47] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/new-css
[10:13:49] <johnkpaul> oh
[10:13:59] <johnkpaul> that was for the new styling?
[10:14:01] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:14:04] <rworth> ajpiano there are likely a lot of cases where we'll want an issue in each/both
[10:14:05] <ajpiano> jquery.github.com/brand.jquery.org/
[10:14:09] <ajpiano> rworth: that's what i figured
[10:14:17] <rworth> one to identify the need, and track the milestone
[10:14:22] <ajpiano> duplicative but like, specific
[10:14:23] <rworth> the other to track the implementation
[10:14:26] <rworth> exactly
[10:15:01] <ajpiano> i'll file an issue for that
[10:15:18] <ajpiano> buritica: i'm planning to kind of take a pass at the home page content today
[10:15:25] <ajpiano> but  we never actually got a mockup for that
[10:15:40] <ajpiano> is that something you'd be interested in working on
[10:15:44] <buritica> well, i'll have some time tonight too
[10:15:47] <ajpiano> we don't need a super DESIGNY design
[10:15:55] <ajpiano> and i can work with you on content
[10:16:05] <buritica> yeah, let's do that then
[10:16:15] <ajpiano> cool, i can probably even get together if you want, let's talk about it after
[10:16:21] <buritica> sure
[10:16:50] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: i'm filing an issue for the new-css branch
[10:16:56] <johnkpaul> ok
[10:16:56] <ajpiano> it needs to happen, but we can't actually launch on new-css
[10:17:04] <ajpiano> at least not for next firday, it seems
[10:17:44] <johnkpaul> I don't tihnk I understand what new-css is for, have the styles specific to learn been changed since that brach?
[10:18:05] <rworth> ajpiano we could, but it would depend on other sites being ready
[10:18:08] <ajpiano> no, the styles from the general child theme have changed and the markup conventions
[10:18:23] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[10:18:25] <ajpiano> so each child theme needs to be adapted to conform to that
[10:18:31] <ajpiano> rworth: yeah, we'll have to play it by ear
[10:18:36] <ajpiano> that's why i want to at least get learn's done
[10:19:29] <rworth> cool
[10:19:32] <ajpiano> So beyond the home page and design issues, and the high level content cleanup that jorydotcom is working on
[10:19:46] <ajpiano> the focus is generally just on improving content
[10:20:01] <ajpiano> there are a few pending PRs
[10:20:08] <jorydotcom> ajpiano on that note I have found some things I feel are pretty duplicative
[10:20:22] <jorydotcom> for example the reserved words section
[10:20:39] <jorydotcom> I don't want to make calls as to what should/shouldn't be culled
[10:21:02] <jorydotcom> but do we have a protocol for making those decisions?
[10:21:06] <ajpiano> which articles are you unsure about
[10:21:11] <ajpiano> yah i was gonna get into that
[10:21:20] <jorydotcom> javascript-101/reserved-words
[10:21:31] <ajpiano> i think that the more you're indoub tof a specific thing
[10:21:39] <ajpiano> then you should just make an atomic PR that does it
[10:21:40] <jorydotcom> perhaps
[10:21:43] <jorydotcom> kk
[10:21:50] <ajpiano> this way we can just get down the meat and potatoes
[10:22:19] <ajpiano> the more confident you are about edits, i'd say, the more you can put into an individual PR :)
[10:22:54] <jorydotcom> okiedok
[10:23:04] <ajpiano> great
[10:23:26] <ajpiano> bentonam: what's the status on https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/176
[10:23:48] <ajpiano> peol: how do we get socialhapy in this channel :)
[10:24:33] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: also, what's the status on https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/156
[10:25:15] <johnkpaul> I still need to go back through and split it out into smaller pieces of content
[10:25:23] <johnkpaul> and make the smaller changes that you've noted
[10:25:34] <johnkpaul> damn hurricane :)
[10:25:35] <ajpiano> cool
[10:25:43] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:25:49] <ajpiano> let's see if we can't knock that out before next fri
[10:25:55] <johnkpaul> yeah, I'll work on it this weekend
[10:27:22] <ajpiano> buritica: sindresorhus what level of interest do you have in working on the content for this at all
[10:28:05] <buritica> i can work on content, but would need some initial guidance
[10:28:28] <ajpiano> FYI all, next friday, i think we're just going to essentially roll with what we have by then, and then work on continually improving it for the more real launch in jan
[10:28:49] <ajpiano> ok
[10:28:53] <jorydotcom> +1
[10:28:56] <ajpiano> there's a lot of things that are synthesized in issues
[10:29:10] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues?state=open and grouped by subject, etc
[10:29:18] <ajpiano> but there's also a lot that isn't :)
[10:29:44] <ajpiano> my plan is basically to launch with what we've got and then say, "hey, have you ever wanted to contribute new features to jQuery, guess what, we are taking ALL FEATURE REQUESTS"
[10:29:49] <ajpiano> only that our features are articles :p
[10:29:54] <buritica> lol
[10:30:31] <johnkpaul> hahaha
[10:30:57] <ajpiano> so we'll see how that works
[10:31:12] <ajpiano> out*
[10:31:53] <ajpiano> by the same token, people will using the site as reference material so my main concern for soft launch is really making sure things that are blatantly outdated or shortsighted, etc,, aren't there
[10:32:24] <buritica> good point
[10:32:27] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: maybe we should split up reading through everything that's already there
[10:32:33] <johnkpaul> just to make sure there's nothing obvious
[10:32:37] <johnkpaul> unless you've already done that
[10:32:40] <johnkpaul> a dozen times
[10:32:42] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: sounds like a good plan
[10:32:54] <ajpiano> jorydotcom is making a major pass on stuff this week
[10:33:09] <ajpiano> once that's complete is probably a good time to run through and do that evaluation
[10:33:40] <ajpiano> and at this meeting next week we can discuss the results of that
[10:33:41] <jorydotcom> I hope to have  a few sections done today -
[10:34:29] <ajpiano> aewsome
[10:34:39] <ajpiano> so i will just noodge everyone a lot in the next few days
[10:34:52] <ajpiano> and rally a few more of the troops who aren't here right now!
[10:35:17] <ajpiano> and then the last thing is to know if gnarf, there's anything you need to know to do
[10:35:37] <ajpiano> so we can get something besides "future home of learn.jquery.com" on learn.jquery.com
[10:35:42] <ajpiano> next friday
[10:36:23] <jorydotcom> woot
[10:36:33] <ajpiano> but i can pick htat up later with gnarf :)
[10:36:58] <ajpiano> kswedberg: kborchers agcolom i know this meeting was soemthing of a surprise for you
[10:36:59] <buritica> good, ajpiano let's sync up later today then
[10:37:27] <ajpiano> but if there's anything your teams need to discuss, please do
[10:37:32] <gnarf> ajpiano: should just be changing DNS then deploying
[10:37:38] <ajpiano> gnarf: awesome
[10:38:16] <kborchers> kswedberg: is probably more up to speed on UI than me. i've been off content for a bit and on 1.10 widget stuff
[10:39:00] <jorydotcom> FYI, i'm working on https://github.com/jorydotcom/learn.jquery.com/tree/183-style-conformance if anyone cares to check that out
[10:40:27] <agcolom> ajpiano: yes I only know about the api docs sites... but still interesting to learn about the other content sites
[10:40:56] <gnarf> ajpiano: friday?
[10:40:59] <ajpiano> kborchers: ah yeah, i thought you had been more on content till you just told me a few mins ago
[10:41:06] <ajpiano> gnarf: next friday
[10:41:44] <ajpiano> agcolom: ok, cool. if you want to let more people know about this and use it discuss anythings from API side, please do
[10:42:48] <agcolom> ok, will do when I have anything to discuss... at the moment, it's still about getting the api mobile docs completed...
[10:43:08] <agcolom> (possibly will release the mobile api site when JQM 1.3 goes out)
[10:43:27] <agcolom> still lots of work needed...
[10:44:21] <ajpiano> i bet :p
[10:44:35] <ajpiano> alright, anyone else have anything for now?
[10:44:51] <ajpiano> otherwise, seems i have a few issues to file and a home page to make
[10:45:13] <ajpiano> jorydotcom: i'll take a look at this branch now too
[10:45:28] <gnarf> 🍰🎉🍰🎉🍰🎉🍰
[10:45:36] <jorydotcom> kk, about to make a new push too
[10:45:38] <gnarf> thats it :)

[10:54:26] <buritica> later
[11:04:49] <toddmparker> ajpiano: mind unmoderating this channel
[11:05:00] <toddmparker> looks like we're set, thanks gnarf
[11:05:08] <ajpiano> yup
[11:05:13] <toddmparker> I need my toddmparker nick to be an op
[11:05:41] <toddmparker> Ok, the jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up

[11:08:07] <johnbender> mine is short
[11:08:29] <toddmparker> ...
[11:08:33] <uGoMobi> I just called arschmitz
[11:08:39] <toddmparker> good call uGoMobi
[11:08:47] <arschmitz> iv been here
[11:08:55] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz
[11:09:02] <toddmparker> so we making good progress on 1.3 features: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:09:03] <agcolom> I'll need some input from johnbender...
[11:09:14] <toddmparker> better than that issue lis indicates
[11:09:47] <toddmparker> we need to start jotting down key changes here as things are landed. this will make the upgrade guide and blog post for the release easier: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
[11:10:27] <kswedberg> meeting?
[11:10:57] <toddmparker> Sure there is a lot missing so if you've added a feature or changed anything that folks should be aware of, please add it there and include links to issues, commits, demos, etc.
[11:11:04] <toddmparker> hey kswedberg
[11:11:22] <kswedberg> hi toddmparker! sorry, just saw my name highlighted
[11:11:25] <toddmparker> who invited the rig raft?
[11:11:31] <kswedberg> didn't mean to crash the party. ;)
[11:11:40] <toddmparker> riff raff…dang autocorrect
[11:11:46] <agcolom> kswedberg: The content meeting was before this one :-)
[11:11:48] <toddmparker> think you're free to go
[11:11:53] <kswedberg> phew!
[11:12:03] <kswedberg> sorry I missed it.
[11:12:12] <toddmparker> There will be maintenance releases for 1.1.2  and 1.2.1 in the coming weeks - more info soon
[11:12:28] <toddmparker> Looks like I'm back on the hook to make change logs for these
[11:12:36] <uGoMobi> RE tracking changes: also make sure to set correct milestone on the closed issue
[11:12:38] <toddmparker> anyone know of an easy way to generate these?
[11:12:44] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good call
[11:12:58] <johnbender> toddmparker: probably a good question for jzaefferer or scott_gonzalez
[11:13:04] <toddmparker> I usually just go through GH commits and copy/paste
[11:13:12] <toddmparker> yeah, i'll ask them
[11:13:25] <toddmparker> last item from me
[11:13:27] <toddmparker> Looking at ways to radically simplify markup and styles for future releases for faster performance and easier customizability for folks who don’t want to use the theme system. Important to explore this before we start the process of moving UI over into the theme framework.
[11:13:54] <toddmparker> for example, we add a lot of classes and markup due to our goal of supporting older IE (6/7)
[11:13:57] <uGoMobi> every commit that should go in the changelog should have ticket with milestone that gets closed by the commit
[11:14:18] <toddmparker> but now that core is dropping those and WP is now based on IE 9 and 10, we can really simplify
[11:14:28] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yes
[11:14:54] <toddmparker> and we should all try to focus on the items tagged to 1.3 so we can wrap this up quickly
[11:15:31] <toddmparker> if it's not in the roadmap or an issue tagged for a maintenance release, we shouldn't spend cycles
[11:15:59] <toddmparker> if you see an issue that seems important enough to add, please raise it and we can discuss moving it into a milestone
[11:16:08] <toddmparker> that's it for me!
[11:17:11] <johnbender> I
[11:17:13] <johnbender> I'll go
[11:17:21] <jzaefferer> toddmparker: you have to ask scott_gonzalez for his `git log` invocations; they're here, but hardly parsable: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js
[11:17:46] <johnbender> the nav test suite is passing for when push state is  supported
[11:17:55] <johnbender> working on the hashchange side now
[11:18:11] <johnbender> its been a total of 2 weeks on this so far :( :(
[11:18:13] <toddmparker> jzaefferer: cool, thanks
[11:18:30] <toddmparker> johnbender: you deserve a medal
[11:18:40] <johnbender> but at least our test suite is good at catching subtleties
[11:19:02] <johnbender> a lot of the time has been spent re-learning all the dark corners of nav
[11:19:07] <johnbender> it's extremely crufty
[11:19:34] <toddmparker> yeah, it's good to dig in there
[11:19:35] <_|Nix|_> Amen, and awesome job!
[11:21:54] <toddmparker> thanks johnbender
[11:22:06] <toddmparker> (I just added a line for you in the agenda)
[11:22:33] <johnbender> toddmparker: thanks, I missed the link
[11:23:28] <agcolom> Could I go next?
[11:24:47] <toddmparker> sure agcolom
[11:25:06] <agcolom> great Thansk
[11:25:09] <agcolom> Merged Checkbox + Radio button into Checkboxradio widget
[11:25:09] <agcolom> Merged Slider + Flip-toggle into Slider widget
[11:25:09] <agcolom> Merged Search input + Text input into Textinput widget
[11:25:09] <agcolom> Still need to merge Header + Footer + Content into Page.sections widget
[11:25:25] <agcolom> (will do that by the end of the week)
[11:25:39] <toddmparker> great
[11:25:50] <agcolom> Added index page to api docs. It’s very basic for now… so please let me know what you'd like to see there
[11:25:52] <toddmparker> I'd like to start coordinating with you on 1.3
[11:26:20] <toddmparker> we're making some small changes to existing widgets with new features and those need to be updated on the API docs
[11:26:47] <toddmparker> so once you're done with those items above, help me pester everyone to update that wiki page
[11:27:00] <agcolom> sure
[11:27:28] <agcolom>     Created the following method entries (note: they all need proper examples):
[11:27:28] <agcolom>         jQuery.mobile.changePage()
[11:27:28] <agcolom>         jQuery.mobile.loadPage()
[11:27:28] <agcolom>         jQuery.mobile.path.isAbsoluteUrl()
[11:27:28] <agcolom>         jQuery.mobile.path.isRelativeUrl()
[11:27:29] <agcolom>         jQuery.mobile.path.get()
[11:27:32] <toddmparker> I also want to figure out how to document the new RWD table stuff in the new format
[11:28:22] <agcolom> I need to know what changePage and loadPage return please :-)
[11:28:47] <toddmparker> agcolom: you and johnbender
[11:29:06] <toddmparker> can talk about how to document a lot of this nag stuff since it's so fresh in his mind
[11:29:06] <johnbender> loadPage returns a promise
[11:29:17] <johnbender> changePage has returns undefined
[11:29:37] <johnbender> s/has//
[11:29:47] <toddmparker> …and johnbender  is going to look at decoupling nav from core a bit more for 1.3 which may impacts docs a bit
[11:29:47] <gnarf> seems like changePage could return a promise too right?
[11:29:56] <gseguin> +1
[11:30:00] <johnbender> toddmparker: for 1.3?
[11:30:03] <johnbender> I don't think there's time
[11:30:19] <johnbender> and I'm worried enough about these changes breaking existing expectations
[11:30:34] <johnbender> gnarf: gseguin: I'm not messing with that just yet
[11:30:39] <johnbender> something to think about though
[11:31:00] <johnbender> and we could resolve the promise where we trigger pagechangee
[11:31:03] <johnbender> or something similar
[11:31:12] <toddmparker> yeah, let's fix what we have first on nag, then look at that
[11:31:14] <gseguin> yep xactly
[11:31:24] <gseguin> and fail it in other places
[11:31:32] <johnbender> gseguin: gnarf: either of you interested in loggin it as a feature request?
[11:32:03] * gseguin is opening the issue tracker
[11:32:03] <johnbender> gseguin: that might be complicated by the fact that it recurses using loadPages promise
[11:32:27] <johnbender> sorry, proceed
[11:33:46] * gseguin created issue 5263
[11:34:06] <agcolom> ok so please let me know of any changes that need ot be documented in hte api docs, and will liaise with johnbender and gseguin for questions....
[11:34:21] <johnbender> agcolom: we won't be making any soon
[11:34:27] <gseguin> not for the next version agcolom
[11:34:31] <johnbender> agcolom: I'll be adding information about the navigate event and method
[11:34:34] <johnbender> but nothing should change otherwise
[11:34:42] <agcolom> ok, good!
[11:34:54] <agcolom> and finally, Now officially on the jQuery Content team and attended our 1st meeting (Thursdays 1pm ET)
[11:35:11] <toddmparker> agcolom: keep an eye here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
[11:35:16] <toddmparker> lots of small things to add
[11:35:25] <agcolom> ok, thanks.
[11:35:43] <toddmparker> anything else?
[11:35:52] <agcolom> and uGoMobi will help me create examples for the methods in the apidocs
[11:36:01] <uGoMobi> I will
[11:36:08] <agcolom> thank you!
[11:36:18] * uGoMobi just returned a promise ;-)
[11:36:33] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:36:41] * gseguin Promise ALL THE THINGS
[11:36:42] <agcolom> toddmparker: if there's anything you'd like to see on the index page, please let me know
[11:37:07] <toddmparker> I will agcolom, looked good so far
[11:37:26] <toddmparker> so the thinking is that your API docs should be released as part of 1.3
[11:37:28] <agcolom> ok, that's it from me!
[11:37:36] <agcolom> yes, that'd be good!
[11:37:44] <toddmparker> so we can dump the current docs and just have new demos
[11:37:50] <toddmparker> so no pressure :)
[11:37:57] <agcolom> no ;)
[11:38:04] <toddmparker> seems like you're in a good shape.
[11:38:22] <toddmparker> gseguin: what's up in builder land?
[11:38:35] <gseguin> in async hell
[11:39:01] <toddmparker> sounds fun
[11:39:06] <gseguin> I'm having trouble making that auto checkout for existing semver tags
[11:39:13] <gseguin> I'm not yet deperate though
[11:39:15] <toddmparker> i see
[11:39:21] <toddmparker> good to hear!
[11:39:32] <toddmparker> no jumping off buildings over this
[11:39:41] <gseguin> heh :)
[11:39:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin promised to fix it
[11:39:55] <_|Nix|_> Not without bungie cord and/or parachute, at any rate.
[11:40:01] <toddmparker> if you're heads down on that, we'll have _|Nix|_ and others work on 1.3 stuff that may be assigned to you ATM
[11:40:18] <gseguin> unless you need me to tackle a particular issue
[11:40:29] <toddmparker> not right now, all general stuff
[11:40:52] <toddmparker> table stuff needs a final pass from me so we can merge that into master
[11:40:55] <toddmparker> so _|Nix|_
[11:40:58] <toddmparker> how goes?
[11:41:05] <gseguin> I thought it might be better that I focus on that since I'm not spending enough time on jQM these days
[11:41:21] <_|Nix|_> Here goes ...
[11:41:32] <_|Nix|_> Mostly working with uGoMobi on the css stuff.
[11:41:45] <toddmparker> you guys are cranking on that
[11:41:45] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately, it looks like we can't do corners in CSS 100%.
[11:42:16] <johnbender> gseguin: callback hell you say?
[11:42:19] <_|Nix|_> The final nail in the coffin was that there's no way to select the first /visible/ element of the children.
[11:42:46] <_|Nix|_> So, refresh() methods are back, but we've still lopped off 139 lines of code/css in the end.
[11:43:28] <_|Nix|_> Tracking down unit test spontaneous timeouts very slowly because I have to keep running the test suit in a loop.
[11:44:06] <_|Nix|_> I'd like to discuss when/how we plan to merge css-corner-styling ...
[11:44:38] <_|Nix|_> I've started editing the xml for documenting controlgroups.
[11:44:45] <_|Nix|_> That's about it.
[11:46:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to update the unit tests in http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-corner-styling/index.html before we merge
[11:46:27] <toddmparker> I think once those are all passing, we can merge
[11:46:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, definitely.
[11:46:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[11:46:37] <_|Nix|_> So that's the plan.
[11:46:38] <toddmparker> are there any widgets not working right with the new corners?
[11:46:39] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[11:46:42] <toddmparker> great stuff
[11:47:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I don't think so, but the unit tests will surely help identify shortcomings, if any.
[11:47:07] <toddmparker> yep
[11:47:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There's also the thing about the checkboxradio.
[11:47:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and I have to update the CSS to use ui-first-child / ui-last-child for corners and border bottom on last visible element
[11:47:25] <toddmparker> helping to review and update the API docs is a great idea
[11:47:34] <toddmparker> be good to have another set of eyes on it
[11:47:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, those classes are currently being added in the code, but they don't exist in the CSS yet :)
[11:48:21] <_|Nix|_> So the thing about checkboxradio ...
[11:48:22] <uGoMobi> that's probably because we invented them an hour ago :)
[11:48:32] <toddmparker> too slow! fix it!
[11:48:41] <uGoMobi> :D
[11:48:51] <_|Nix|_> It's not supposed to have a checkbox/radio icon while inside a horizontal controlgroup.
[11:48:51] <gseguin> tyranic boss
[11:49:09] <toddmparker> you're fired gseguin
[11:49:22] <toddmparker> :p
[11:49:26] <_|Nix|_> But if placed inside a horizontal controlgroup after it's already been enhanced, or if the vertical controlgroup is later converted to a horizontal one, the icon remains.
[11:49:33] <gseguin> again?
[11:49:49] <_|Nix|_> So, uGoMobi's looking at a CSS-based solution to fix that, and failing that, I have a JS-based solution in mind
[11:50:02] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, but this time it's not at _create() time.
[11:50:04] <uGoMobi> solution display: none;
[11:50:09] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: man, that is an edge case
[11:50:35] <toddmparker> but worth fixing if we can
[11:50:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, the alternative, of course, is to file the issue and move on.
[11:50:49] <toddmparker> we'll see what uGoMobi comes up with
[11:50:57] <toddmparker> always rather fix things
[11:51:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, actually, filing the issue anyway probably can't hurt.
[11:51:23] <_|Nix|_> ... except our issue count.
[11:51:27] <toddmparker> sure, but filing against a branch...
[11:51:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, no. The issue is happening on all branches.
[11:51:48] <toddmparker> if you landed this w/o a fix, might be a good time for an issue
[11:51:52] <uGoMobi> more specific .ui-controlgroup-horizontal .ui-radio/.ui-checkbox .ui-name-of-the-icon { display: none; }
[11:52:04] <toddmparker> oh, so this is an existing issue, not related to the new corners?
[11:52:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Correct.
[11:52:15] <toddmparker> then an issue make sense, yes
[11:52:23] <uGoMobi> and I will make the text ignore the icon position class
[11:52:24] <toddmparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[11:52:29] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you're up!
[11:52:38] <toddmparker> how goes the presentation?
[11:52:44] <arschmitz> Alright most of my time this week was on my presentation
[11:53:02] <arschmitz> which is finally finished just polishing up some minor color and layout things
[11:53:23] <arschmitz> its even avalible in almost every language
[11:53:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5264
[11:54:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Woah! How'd you do that?
[11:54:23] <arschmitz> pr #5260 for the workarounds is ready to merge this will close 5 issues!
[11:54:31] <arschmitz> google website translate widget!
[11:54:34] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:54:39] <arschmitz> even got it to ignore code examples
[11:54:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[11:54:42] * uGoMobi loves those kind of PR's
[11:55:01] <toddmparker> nice job on that fixed extension arschmitz
[11:55:05] <toddmparker> looks great
[11:55:19] <toddmparker> did you and gseguin figure out how to deal with the builder/require stuff?
[11:55:26] <arschmitz> thank you johnbender and uGoMobi approve so it just needs the button pressed
[11:55:45] <arschmitz> yeah its fine just needs descirption updated once its merged
[11:55:48] <toddmparker> I'm not too concerned if this isn't checked by default in the builder so if that's a hassle, meh
[11:56:06] <uGoMobi> can we make it opt-out?
[11:56:22] <toddmparker> meaning if you check fixed, the extension is checked
[11:56:26] <uGoMobi> if you check fixedToolbars this module will be checked too by default
[11:56:37] <toddmparker> i think that was the plan
[11:56:42] <uGoMobi> oh ok, sorry
[11:56:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's dependency, and that tracks something else.
[11:56:51] <toddmparker> wasn't sure if that was tricky with our dependency stuff - gseguin?
[11:57:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No, because the dependency goes the other way. the workaround requires fixedToolbar, but not vice versa.
[11:57:21] <toddmparker> the extension depends on the fixed toolbar, but not vice-versa
[11:57:27] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:57:28] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:57:30] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:57:35] <toddmparker> jinx!
[11:57:47] <_|Nix|_> So, the relationship going the other way cannot be called "dependency"
[11:57:49] <kborchers> arschmitz: that was an awesome idea! i have added that translation widget to my slides as well :)
[11:57:53] <toddmparker>  don't think we have a way to say "this should be checked"
[11:58:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... other than to mention the extension in the description for fixedToolbar ...
[11:58:24] <toddmparker> but that may be fine. it will be included in the full build
[11:58:40] <arschmitz> i think the solution gseguin suggested is an all caps description suggesting it
[11:58:42] <toddmparker> the reason we made this an extension was we are leery of all the stuff needed
[11:58:49] <uGoMobi> I was just thinking about simple JS that checks workarounds module if you check fixedToolbars, but you can still uncheck workarounds
[11:58:57] <toddmparker> so having hacks unchecked in the builder is probably ok
[11:59:07] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:59:26] <toddmparker> you just end up with that growing over time and getting uglier
[11:59:37] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:59:39] <toddmparker> if someone forgets, they can re-download
[11:59:44] <arschmitz> and if there is something suggesting it in the description hopefully they will take notice
[11:59:56] <toddmparker> we can also add a note to the fixed toolbar plugin description that mentions the extension
[12:00:05] <toddmparker> yeah arschmitz
[12:00:15] <arschmitz> good idea ill add it to both when i update the description
[12:00:19] <toddmparker> cool
[12:00:52] <arschmitz> and i think we decided 1.3 on this right because all isues are tagged 1.1.2
[12:01:12] <arschmitz> so we will want to update them when they are closed
[12:02:33] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, this will be a 1.3 feature
[12:02:53] <toddmparker> if you send me all the issues I'll re-tag to 1.3 if you can't
[12:03:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let me know if any of the issues that you close with PR does not have milestone 1.3
[12:03:11] <toddmparker> a big enough change that this won't go into a maintenance release
[12:03:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5260 They're in the description.
[12:03:22] <arschmitz> yeah i dont have access so one of you will have too
[12:03:29] <toddmparker> yeah, the milestone is important for tracking
[12:03:30] <arschmitz> yes they are all in the description
[12:03:58] <arschmitz> So who whants to hit the big green button and merge it ??
[12:04:04] <_|Nix|_> Rock!
[12:04:22] <_|Nix|_> What? No one say "Paper!" ?
[12:04:50] <toddmparker> scissors!
[12:04:54] <toddmparker> wait...
[12:04:58] <toddmparker> dang it
[12:05:00] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:05:14] <toddmparker> I'm bad at this guys
[12:05:22] <_|Nix|_> OK. Done.
[12:05:28] <toddmparker> BOOM
[12:05:37] <toddmparker> I can do some serious testing next week
[12:05:47] <arschmitz> ok so once those issues are update we are back under 300
[12:05:49] <uGoMobi> congrats arschmitz ! really nice work!
[12:06:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: awesome since i will be gone untill the next meeting!
[12:06:26] <arschmitz> my final thing is i just have one more simple pr that i need reviewed.
[12:06:33] <toddmparker> yeah, thanks arschmitz
[12:06:42] <toddmparker> where are you going to be?
[12:06:50] <arschmitz> south korea lol
[12:07:32] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I re-milestoned all the bugs and closed them.
[12:07:39] <toddmparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[12:07:51] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay! 298 issues.
[12:07:52] <toddmparker> riiiight, sorry I spaced on that
[12:07:55] <toddmparker> have a blast
[12:07:59] <toddmparker> woo hoo
[12:08:13] <arschmitz> ok so i need someone to review  pr #5262
[12:08:24] <toddmparker> might be a good one for uGoMobi
[12:08:29] <arschmitz> right now if you destroy fixed toolbars the page padding remains
[12:08:30] <toddmparker> i can help test if needed
[12:08:36] <toddmparker> gotcha
[12:08:38] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:08:45] <arschmitz> this just restores page padding when destroyed
[12:09:00] <toddmparker> restores the default?
[12:09:09] * uGoMobi assigned
[12:09:17] <arschmitz> we modify it useing .css
[12:09:36] <arschmitz> so the only way to "restore" is to put back to zero
[12:09:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Great! We need to make sure destroy() cleans up after itself ...
[12:10:00] <uGoMobi> issue good be if someone sets padding in his custom CSS
[12:10:17] <toddmparker> that was my thought there
[12:10:19] <arschmitz> updatepagepadding will overwrite
[12:10:25] <arschmitz> already
[12:10:29] <uGoMobi> have to see if updatePagePadding takes that into account anyway
[12:10:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cood point. The correct way would be to remove that CSS property.
[12:10:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I think so
[12:11:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Unfortunately, there's no API for removing individual inline style properties.
[12:11:12] <uGoMobi> remove it from the element andwhatever is in the custom CSS will apply
[12:11:31] <uGoMobi> css("property","")
[12:11:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, really? Cool!
[12:11:47] <arschmitz> neat i didnt know that
[12:11:47] <uGoMobi> thought so
[12:11:58] <arschmitz> ok well ill update it to do that instead of zero
[12:12:10] <uGoMobi> but I'm pretty sure it is possible
[12:12:22] <uGoMobi> ok shall I quickly do my updates
[12:12:23] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:12:30] <uGoMobi> we are running late
[12:12:33] <toddmparker> sure uGoMobi
[12:12:38] <toddmparker> big team!
[12:12:56] <uGoMobi> ok so I worked with _|Nix|_ on css corner styling
[12:13:15] <uGoMobi> additions to what _|Nix|_ already said...
[12:13:16] <uGoMobi> added option corners for: dialogs + collapsibles + (inset) listviews, added option shadow for (inset) listviews
[12:13:29] <uGoMobi> we have to update the TR: corner classes have been removed from theme CSS
[12:13:35] <toddmparker> right
[12:13:54] <uGoMobi> TR = ThemeRoller
[12:14:01] <uGoMobi> (for the record)
[12:14:14] <uGoMobi> folder /demos is now on master /docs/demos/
[12:14:14] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[12:14:29] <uGoMobi> added examples of most components - useful as reference and for testing
[12:14:29] <uGoMobi> next: adding RWD and dynamic content “real world” demos
[12:14:29] <uGoMobi> view source code: code wraps now
[12:14:48] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: made an issue for TR. https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/118
[12:14:56] <toddmparker> think that will happen by default
[12:15:21] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I'll start adding my RWD stuff from the jsbins
[12:15:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we can probably simplefy the regex
[12:15:33] <toddmparker> grids, etc.
[12:15:43] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[12:15:45] <toddmparker> regex for...
[12:16:09] <uGoMobi> the TR looks for the comments in the CSS
[12:16:34] <uGoMobi> and inject the correct values
[12:17:12] <toddmparker> ah, i see
[12:17:16] <uGoMobi> if I am not mistaken
[12:17:24] <toddmparker> that's how it works, yes
[12:17:43] <uGoMobi> I thought that was done with a regex
[12:18:00] <toddmparker> it must be, yep
[12:18:06] <uGoMobi> anyway, we can remove the code that looks for all the corner classes
[12:18:14] <uGoMobi> fixed programmatically setting options
[12:18:14] <uGoMobi> listview “filter” https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5245
[12:18:14] <uGoMobi> checkboxradio & textinput “mini” https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4070
[12:18:29] <toddmparker> I think the regex is pretty simple - it looks for the comment strings and replaces before
[12:18:31] <uGoMobi> question: for 1.3 or 1.1.2/1.2.1? those are not new options
[12:18:49] <toddmparker> since we still have a UI to input the radii, it will just replace the radii for the -all classes
[12:19:22] <toddmparker> those could probably be ported back unless you see a risk
[12:19:34] <toddmparker> seem like simple fixes
[12:19:42] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:19:51] <uGoMobi> just have to look at it
[12:20:08] <toddmparker> seeing some test failures from jenkins from this recent changes
[12:20:09] <uGoMobi> checkboxradio & textinput “mini” is on roadmap for 1.3
[12:20:16] <uGoMobi> but feels more like a bug fix
[12:20:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker:my fault already fixed
[12:20:36] <uGoMobi> the option was already documented as if you can set it programmatically
[12:20:51] <toddmparker> yeah, I can see that
[12:20:57] <toddmparker> sure
[12:21:09] <uGoMobi> cherry-pick in the stable branches?
[12:21:12] <toddmparker> no objections from me
[12:21:16] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:21:21] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[12:21:26] <toddmparker> thanks uGoMobi
[12:21:33] <toddmparker> think that's everyone
[12:21:39] <toddmparker> any Q's from the community?
[12:22:12] <toddmparker> Anyone who may be interested in helping on on the project, please speak up here on on #jquerymobile-dev
[12:22:26] <toddmparker> We're always looking for help
[12:22:51] <toddmparker> ok, guess we can wrap up then
[12:22:59] <toddmparker> thanks everyone, seriously productive week
[12:23:16] <_|Nix|_> Awesome! See y'all in -dev!
[12:23:38] <toddmparker> Over and out
[12:29:11] <agcolom> ok, thx :-)
[12:29:38] <agcolom> someone needs to close the channel...
