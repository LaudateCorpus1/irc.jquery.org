[08:59:43] <jzaefferer> unmuted \o/
[08:59:48] <rworth> :)
[09:01:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: updated agenda a bit, I'm ready
[09:01:52] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: you around?
[09:02:09] <jzaefferer> gnarf: over here!
[09:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> just landed the initial implementation of $.ui.interaction!
[09:03:31] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:03:49] <rworth> yay
[09:03:51] <kborchers> yay
[09:03:55] <jzaefferer> nice
[09:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> still lots to do before it's a full replacement for mouse, but it's a start
[09:03:58] <jzaefferer> what does that mean?
[09:04:18] <jzaefferer> so interaction > mouse?
[09:04:20] <rworth> I tested the wii remote this week, it's all mouse no touch. It's also Opera 9.3 :(
[09:04:33] <rworth> but existing interactions work in it
[09:04:34] <jzaefferer> yak
[09:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh, cool, so they get mapped to standard mouse events?
[09:05:11] <rworth> yup
[09:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> that's both good and bad
[09:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> good because it just works
[09:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> bad because I was really hoping it would give us another API to test against
[09:05:33] <rworth> yeah
[09:05:52] <rworth> we can just invent one ;)
[09:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> maybe we can do a Kinect hook :-)
[09:06:07] <rworth> was just gonna say - kinect would be fun
[09:06:37] <jzaefferer> can we start with touch events?
[09:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, mouse + w3c touch + MS touch
[09:06:55] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's wild west enough
[09:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> I was just hoping for a third type of API (not mouse or touch) to do final testing against
[09:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> but the important thing is just mouse + touch
[09:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's get to the agenda
[09:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden doesn't seem to be here
[09:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> maybe we can get an infrastructure update later if he shows up
[09:09:11] <jzaefferer> is there open stuff?
[09:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:09:21] <jzaefferer> k
[09:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> but always good to find out if they're working on anything that might affect us
[09:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> on to interactions
[09:09:52] <jzaefferer> sure
[09:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> as I just said, I just landed $.ui.interaction
[09:10:09] <jzaefferer> so Dave is going to push to jquer/jquery-ui as well?
[09:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> I also merged in Dave's latest work on draggable and droppable
[09:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't seen him in over a week
[09:10:39] <scott_gonzalez> but I was planning on telling him to
[09:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just send him an emil
[09:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> *email
[09:11:12] <jzaefferer> also, merge master instead of adopting old APIs :p
[09:11:17] <jzaefferer> there should never be a reason not to merge
[09:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I'm gonna do that today
[09:11:38] <jzaefferer> except when you update jQuery in master and 1-8-stable and not any other branches
[09:11:56] <jzaefferer> I wonder if we could automate that to update all branches
[09:12:13] <jzaefferer> maybe not worth it for just one or two, but 6 oder 7?
[09:12:44] <jzaefferer> more like 8
[09:13:40] <jzaefferer> tabs keybindings still WIP?
[09:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:13:59] <jzaefferer> and 1.8.17 next week
[09:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I landed 1.7.1 and fixed all remaining 1.7.x bugs
[09:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> so it's just a matter of doing the release now
[09:15:13] <jzaefferer> nice
[09:15:16] <rworth> did you run through all the demos?
[09:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, no
[09:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> need to do that
[09:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> anyone want to tackle a specific browser?
[09:16:11] <rworth> I'll do chrome
[09:16:14] <rworth> with master?
[09:16:27] <scott_gonzalez> 1-8-stable
[09:16:32] <rworth> right
[09:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> if there are problems in master, we'll find out about them well before 1.9 :-)
[09:18:48] <jzaefferer> download builder then!
[09:19:07] <jzaefferer> need to try it out, but one thing: need to rename jquib
[09:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> agreed
[09:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> so Charlie did an initial implementation for the download builder
[09:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/download-builder
[09:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> he's looking for feedback on whether it meets our requirements
[09:20:40] <jzaefferer> let's hop on Skype after this and give it a try?
[09:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:21:20] <jzaefferer> selectmenu and testswarm clients might also better be discussed on Skype - unless someone else is around with input
[09:21:30] <jzaefferer> was thinking clarkbox might be able to help with the browserstack stuff
[09:22:37] <jzaefferer> not on the agenda, but we should land this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/354
[09:22:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by spekary (5m, 3w ago): 3rd attempt
[09:22:48] <jzaefferer> took a few months, but there is now a test
[09:22:56] <jzaefferer> and its bugging a client of mine
[09:23:13] <jzaefferer> almost the only issue they had with jQuery UI, using 1.9m6
[09:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:38] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: accordion hoverintent isn't working in 1-8-stable in chrome
[09:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> it was working for me
[09:23:55] <jzaefferer> Felix can't make it to the meeting, busy with some release
[09:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> clear cache?
[09:24:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you need me to run through some browsers on 1-8-stable? I have IE9, Opera 11.x, Safari 5.1.1, FF8 available
[09:24:04] <jzaefferer> but he's working with Dan Wellman on unit tests
[09:24:14] <jzaefferer> resolving the menu focus issue would help them to move forward
[09:24:21] <rworth> flashcage
[09:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: yeah, if you want to pick 1 or 2 of those that'd be great
[09:24:54] <kborchers> ok, i'll take Opera and Safari .. just demos or vis/unit tests as well?
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> just demos
[09:26:29] <kborchers> ok
[09:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> well, tests wouldn't hurt
[09:27:08] <kborchers> ok, i can run through those as well
[09:28:13] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: the individual file works, but it doesn't work in the runner
[09:37:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: there is an issue with default draggable in opera (also an issue in 1.8.16 ). Clicking directly on the icon to resize occasionally only resizes in one direction even if it is showing that it would resize in both directions before drag
[09:37:27] <kborchers> does that make sense?
[09:38:19] <kborchers> it doesn't happen in Chrome
[09:42:18] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: color animation also doesn't work in the runnner but works in the individual file
[09:45:23] <rworth> kborchers: at this point we're only looking for regressions introduced by jQuery 1.7
[09:45:25] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, I think you added the code that Felix is now dealing with in selectmenu: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e16e99a154d7f3bdbc7ffe56e5c74e9fe90bbd6b
[09:45:27] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (3m, 4w ago): Menu: Added focusing first menu item when menu receives focus and collapseAll when menu loses focus (blur).
[09:46:39] <kborchers> rworth: ok
[09:47:29] <kborchers> jzaefferer: is that an issue? without it, there is no visual cue that the menu has gained focus and i think it may be necessary for some keyboard interactions
[09:47:51] <jzaefferer> yeah, it makes sense, but not for selectmenu, where the menu doesn't really get focus
[09:48:21] <kborchers> hmmm ... probably an issue for autocomplete as well then?
[09:49:20] <jzaefferer> yep
[09:49:35] <jzaefferer> so we need to make that an option or something that can be turned off
[09:49:53] <kborchers> ok, that shouldn't be too hard ... i'll add a note to the menu wiki and take care of it
[09:50:39] <kborchers> now that i'm not worrying about the parent/child stuff i should be able to make some progress on menu, menubar and popup
[09:50:48] <jzaefferer> okay, great
[10:00:31] <jzaefferer> let's see if Brad or Boris show up; nothing much to discuss for grid anyway
[10:04:11] <rworth> borismoore: hey. Do you have anything? Caus I don't think we do
[10:04:22] <borismoore> No I don't
[10:04:30] <rworth> ok, Happy Thanksgiving
[10:04:32] <borismoore> been busy with team work
[10:04:37] <borismoore> sounds good!
