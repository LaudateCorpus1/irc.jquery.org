[10:58:29] <toddparker> Hi all
[10:58:44] <toddparker> The jQuery Mobile meeting will be starting in a minute
[10:59:51] <toddparker> chime in if you're here
[11:00:10] <toddparker> agenda - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeOJkCXDdKup73_VBIfhxVTAiMcNhp6TZWMIQooTg4Y/edit#
[11:01:45] <gseguin> here
[11:02:24] <uGoMobi> present
[11:02:46] <johnbender> oi!
[11:03:16] <toddparker> hey all…might just be us
[11:03:27] <ryanneufeld> yo
[11:03:32] <toddparker> I know _|Nix|_ and agcolom are out
[11:03:39] <toddparker> is JasonDScott around?
[11:04:46] <toddparker> anyway, let's get started
[11:05:00] <toddparker> 1.2 status
[11:05:15] <toddparker> Announcement: we’ve decided to re-work some of the popup history code to see if that will help with some of the WP7 (focus state, scroll jump when closing popups). Since this will require a fair amount of code re-factoring (and reduction), we’ve decided to release a beta version to make sure there are no regression before moving on to RC status.
[11:06:01] <toddparker> in this work, we hope to simplify the history mgmt stuff and maybe help out poor WP7
[11:06:07] <toddparker> johnbender: is on the case
[11:06:56] <toddparker> I'm working on taking the great change log MauriceG created and building the beta blog post
[11:07:12] <toddparker> gseguin is updating master to use 1.8 today, been testing with core master for a while but good to use it daily
[11:07:39] <toddparker> when 1.2 final hits, we should support 1.6.4-1.8.1
[11:07:41] <gseguin> testing is happening right now with 1.8.0, so far so good
[11:08:10] <toddparker> cool. if 1.8.1 lands soon enough, we'll try to be cutting edge :)
[11:08:11] <johnbender> gseguin: running it locally?
[11:08:20] <toddparker> great gseguin - is that in master now?
[11:08:21] <gseguin> yeah johnbender
[11:08:23] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[11:08:30] <toddparker> ah
[11:08:36] <johnbender> gseguin: we need to push our old version testing off to a seperate build
[11:08:36] <gseguin> nope wanted to test before pushing
[11:08:46] <toddparker> cool
[11:08:47] <toddparker> Targeting 1.2 beta late next week at the earliest with a RC soon after
[11:08:54] <toddparker> Roadmap prioritization well underway, will have public details within a week or so
[11:09:14] <toddparker> That's it on the project side of things
[11:09:20] <toddparker> gseguin: wanna go?
[11:09:24] <gseguin> sure
[11:09:51] <gseguin> Joyent is discontinuing no.de, that’s where we host the backend service for the download builder. Their replacement (nodejitsu) is really cool but you can’t SSH to the VM which kinda sucks for our purpose: it’s needed to create the initial checkout and workspaces. Waiting on gnarf for the machine to be ready on jQuery hardware. I should be done by the end of the week
[11:10:07] <toddparker> when is that going to be discontinued?
[11:10:15] * gseguin finds out
[11:10:19] <toddparker> do we have time to make the switch easily
[11:10:20] <toddparker> ok
[11:10:34] <gseguin> October 31, 2012
[11:10:39] <johnbender> o.O
[11:10:54] <toddparker> pretty soon then
[11:10:56] <johnbender> well I suppose that's 3 months notice
[11:10:57] <toddparker> yikes
[11:10:57] <gseguin> should give us enough time
[11:11:12] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: ping me later on the vm stuff, sounds like it's relevant
[11:11:24] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: it is indeed
[11:11:40] <johnbender> Nodejitsu: Out with the old ... fast.
[11:11:50] <toddparker> exactly
[11:12:22] <toddparker> thanks gseguin - anything else on your radar?
[11:12:23] <johnbender> That sounds like a particularly node.js approach to host :P
[11:12:25] <gseguin> and moving master to 1.8
[11:12:29] <gseguin> that's it
[11:12:32] <toddparker> yep
[11:12:38] <toddparker> ok
[11:12:39] <gseguin> open to help on anything for 1.2
[11:12:59] <toddparker> thanks, think this popup stuff is the only blockers there
[11:13:09] <toddparker> johnbender: wanna go?
[11:13:21] <toddparker> also: see if there are tasks gseguin could help with on popup
[11:13:27] <johnbender> disabling base tag manip[
[11:13:34] <johnbender> still waiting on feedback from the latest on that branch
[11:13:45] <johnbender> killed a couple of prs
[11:13:48] <johnbender> popup
[11:14:24] <johnbender> I think that bug Wilto was looking at is fixed by  my changes too
[11:14:55] <toddparker> which one?
[11:15:04] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4883
[11:15:16] <toddparker> yeah? great
[11:15:36] <toddparker> i saw you committed some fixes already on popup…how far along are you?
[11:15:42] <johnbender> well
[11:15:46] <johnbender> from my testing it's mostly done
[11:15:50] <johnbender> _but_
[11:16:00] <johnbender> I have some questions about use case expectations in the tests
[11:16:06] <johnbender> we can talk about that after this
[11:16:29] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:16:35] <toddparker> this commit so far: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7a14e1588977
[11:16:39] <toddparker> big simplifications
[11:17:12] <toddparker> is uGoMobi here?
[11:17:18] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:17:24] <toddparker> oh hai
[11:17:27] <uGoMobi> hi :)
[11:17:29] <toddparker> what are you up to?
[11:17:32] <uGoMobi> my turn i guess
[11:17:51] <toddparker> yep
[11:18:27] <uGoMobi> started to look into some open issues
[11:18:49] <uGoMobi> as you know I was "out of business" for a while because my system was down
[11:18:57] <uGoMobi> issues:
[11:19:01] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4663
[11:19:07] <toddparker> we now have a few more days of dev time now that we're tweaking popup so we can keep fixing
[11:19:19] <toddparker> yeah, seems like you're back?
[11:19:42] <toddparker> ^^ that would be a good one to fix up
[11:19:53] <toddparker> seems close
[11:19:56] <uGoMobi> yeah, but because I couldn't work for a week I had to catch up client work first, sorry
[11:20:17] <uGoMobi> so was biit of a crazy week
[11:20:22] <uGoMobi> but I am getting there :)
[11:20:30] <toddparker> ok, no problem
[11:20:37] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4863
[11:20:38] <toddparker> gseguin: this can be closed, right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4292
[11:20:55] <gseguin> yes
[11:21:11] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4856
[11:21:27] <uGoMobi> so those 3 issues first
[11:21:34] <uGoMobi> then Opera transitions
[11:21:35] <gseguin> toddparker: they can build the file through the builder
[11:21:37] <toddparker> gseguin: I closed
[11:21:45] <gseguin> toddparker:  I'll comment
[11:21:57] <gseguin> toddparker: oh man! you're fast
[11:22:12] <toddparker> 4856 is important…i'd tackle that first to make sure we don't forget
[11:22:15] <toddparker> BOOM
[11:22:16] <uGoMobi> now we do a beta... shall we pull those 2 PR's from MauriceG https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulls/MauriceG
[11:22:44] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok 4856 high priority
[11:22:55] <toddparker> uGoMobi: I think so…any objections
[11:23:17] <uGoMobi> I reviewed both, maybe gseguin or johnbender want to have a quick look too
[11:23:31] <toddparker> gseguin: mind taking a look?
[11:23:38] <gseguin> sure
[11:23:48] <toddparker> trying to leave johnbender alone so he can get all zen on the popups
[11:23:50] <uGoMobi> and then.... triage!!!
[11:24:14] <toddparker> absolutely
[11:24:17] <toddparker> we can jam on that
[11:24:33] <johnbender> I think I was fine with both of those if they work and get tests
[11:24:51] <toddparker> alright, nice and quick meeting since we have 1/2 the people :)
[11:24:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok
[11:24:58] <toddparker> any questions from the community?
[11:25:06] <johnbender> ^^^^^^^
[11:25:38] <johnbender> to the hangout
[11:27:06] <toddparker> thanks all!
