[09:00:17] <kborchers> meeting time
[09:00:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez is out and jzaefferer will be late
[09:00:27] <kborchers> who else is here?
[09:00:31] <rworth> yo
[09:01:36] <kborchers> rxaviers: around?
[09:01:55] * rxaviers is here
[09:01:57] <kborchers> mikesherov: ?
[09:02:25] <kborchers> ok i guess if you want to give us an update on your stuff rxaviers, go ahead
[09:02:31] <rxaviers> ok
[09:03:05] <tj_vantoll1> here as well
[09:03:09] <rxaviers> my DB/TR updates are: The multi versions v0 is out there. It's on the `versions` branch, you can fetch and try it out. Although, there are some remaining TODOs: a) On `grunt prepare`, get the correct documantation for each jquery-ui, b) Fix two usability issues: i) Selecting a different version re-selects all components, possibly erasing previous user selection; ii) Going forward to themeroller and back to download builder misses previous selected
[09:03:10] <rxaviers>  version. It selects the stable (default);
[09:03:15] <rxaviers> There is one more 1.10.0 blocker: fix builder to handle some 1.10.0 differences in file structure: metadata and bgiframe are gone.
[09:03:43] <rxaviers> That's all
[09:04:15] <mikesherov> hi
[09:04:18] <mikesherov> one sec
[09:04:31] <kborchers> ok, cool. any sort of timeframe on those outstanding items rxaviers?
[09:05:03] <rxaviers> Sure. (a) about an hour or so. (b) still needs check
[09:05:11] <kborchers> :)
[09:05:13] <kborchers> ok
[09:05:31] <rxaviers> I guess I need to change the way I pass info in the url vars
[09:05:44] <rxaviers> and it will need some more client js as well.
[09:06:09] <mikesherov> OK, I'm here
[09:06:10] <rxaviers> But, Im not yet able to guess an estimation for that. :P
[09:06:17] <kborchers> ok
[09:06:25] <kborchers> mikesherov: any update on mergatron?
[09:06:29] <mikesherov> yes
[09:06:41] <mikesherov> so, gnarf and I are going to be installing it this weekend
[09:06:56] <mikesherov> I updated core the same way this weekend
[09:07:02] <mikesherov> on Monday, that is
[09:07:17] <mikesherov> we discussed that holidays was the only time to get things done :-P
[09:07:31] <kborchers> :)
[09:08:45] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez is moving today?
[09:08:59] <kborchers> yes
[09:09:36] <kborchers> mikesherov: he's getting stuff done over the holiday :D
[09:10:20] <mikesherov> ok, so lets move along here!
[09:10:44] <kborchers> ok, johnkpaul you around? wondering if you are working on switching to new-css for UI or need someone to help with that
[09:11:32] <rworth> actually, I've been on that
[09:11:40] <kborchers> oh, ok. cool
[09:11:44] <kborchers> how's that going?
[09:11:47] <rworth> about 90% at this point
[09:11:51] <kborchers> nice
[09:11:55] <jzaefferer> Hey! On my phone, on the way home.
[09:12:02] <rworth> still a bit of work to do on api.jqueryui
[09:12:10] <kborchers> ok
[09:12:26] <rworth> not too bad
[09:13:13] <kborchers> jzaefferer: able to update on dialog?
[09:14:19] <jzaefferer> See the spreadsheet. It's all there
[09:14:39] <kborchers> gotcha
[09:14:49] <jzaefferer> Really close to merging to master
[09:15:00] <kborchers> nice
[09:15:44] <kborchers> hope to get my PR i have against the dialog branch in before that if i can get the damn tests written. simulating mouse events always gives me issues for some reason
[09:15:45] <jzaefferer> Will work through remaining issues, wiki update and docs
[09:16:46] <kborchers> ok
[09:16:55] <mikesherov> yeah, if we could merge in the long standing PR's, that'd be ideal
[09:17:09] <kborchers> i've got the indeterminate progressbar all set i think
[09:17:27] <kborchers> mikesherov: i put that complete event back in. anything else stopping you from merging?
[09:17:54] <jzaefferer> Can someone review selectmenu?
[09:17:57] <mikesherov> kborchers: I at this point need to rely on jzaefferer and scott_gonzalez to OK it. I'm not reliable or knowledgeable enough yet
[09:18:02] <jzaefferer> Felix needs more feedback
[09:18:10] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: can we merge indeterminate progressbar?
[09:18:32] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i can take a look at selectmenu … maybe this weekend after the US holiday
[09:18:46] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: I rely too much on Scott
[09:18:53] <mikesherov> haha
[09:19:17] <jzaefferer> Progress bar should be good to go. I looked at the last update
[09:19:27] <rworth> just wait till scott_gonzalez starts to rely too much on mikesherov, then we'll be in trouble ;)
[09:19:29] <jzaefferer> It's not set in stone anyway
[09:20:02] <kborchers> ok, i'll merge progressbar unless you want to do that mikesherov
[09:20:32] <jzaefferer> kborchers: test for dialog issue would be great. I can land that in the dialog branch then
[09:20:43] <mikesherov> kborchers: one last question… do we have a test for the close event?
[09:20:56] <mikesherov> I'd want that if we don't have it
[09:21:00] <jzaefferer> It's your PR, you can merge it
[09:21:05] <jzaefferer> No one else to blame
[09:21:14] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yep, i'll try to get that test done today
[09:21:18] <mikesherov> yeah, kborchers merge away if it has a close test!
[09:21:53] <mikesherov> yeah, in general, I just wanted to mention to all… we should never land stuff ourselves without supporting tests
[09:21:54] <jzaefferer> Probably no close event test, would've noticed the issue earlier if there was on
[09:21:57] <jzaefferer> One
[09:22:02] <mikesherov> except for extreme circumstances
[09:22:18] <jzaefferer> Like CSS?
[09:22:28] <mikesherov> right, or impossible to simulate reliably
[09:22:43] <mikesherov> all JS should come with tests, ideally
[09:22:55] <kborchers> ok, we're talking about two things at the same time
[09:22:58] <mikesherov> HAHA
[09:23:01] <kborchers> you meant close event test on dialog
[09:23:13] <kborchers> i was talking about merging progressbar
[09:23:16] <mikesherov> I meant close event on indeterminate progressbar
[09:23:21] <kborchers> close?
[09:23:29] <mikesherov> sorry
[09:23:33] <mikesherov> That's why I'm confusing
[09:23:36] <mikesherov> "complete"
[09:23:40] <kborchers> ah, ok
[09:23:44] <mikesherov> my bad
[09:23:48] <kborchers> i can do that
[09:24:00] <mikesherov> great, after that, merge at will!
[09:24:03] <kborchers> cool
[09:24:35] <kborchers> mikesherov: tj_vantoll1 triage update?
[09:24:39] <mikesherov> yup
[09:24:50] <mikesherov> so tj_vantoll1 is a beast… no new tickets get past him
[09:24:55] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you should have edit rights on the agenda now
[09:25:03] <mikesherov> we have 0 "new"
[09:25:04] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ;) thks
[09:25:13] <kborchers> nice!
[09:25:17] <mikesherov> 14 "pending"
[09:25:28] <jzaefferer> Nicely enough, that worked on my Android phone
[09:25:31] <mikesherov> 419 "active"
[09:25:44] <petersendidit> And the ticket count has almost cut in half since Oct 1
[09:25:59] <jzaefferer> Can you get those numbers into the spreadsheet?
[09:26:03] <kborchers> yeah, that's pretty amazing
[09:26:15] <kborchers> jzaefferer: they're there
[09:26:26] <jzaefferer> Maybe add PRs as well
[09:26:30] <rworth> way to go. you guys rock
[09:26:33] <mikesherov> I'll add PR's
[09:26:49] <mikesherov> added
[09:26:52] <mikesherov> 26 pull requests
[09:27:08] <mikesherov> We should review the ones that we have open and ask if they're safe for landing...
[09:27:21] <mikesherov> can we do that for 5 minutes now? or is that not a good use of time?
[09:27:22] <jzaefferer> I can edit access, but can't open it :/
[09:27:43] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: scott_gonzalez mentioned to me that if you want to meet after work it's most likely after 9PM for him - it's 7 for you right? Hopefully we'll be able to get on that API call next week
[09:27:53] <jzaefferer> I can't help with that right now. Do it at the end?
[09:28:01] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: sorry about that
[09:28:09] <mikesherov> yeah, next week good
[09:28:35] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: I'll be sure to hound you and Scott on monday then to figure out a time - eager to get on it
[09:28:40] <Dave_Stein> :)
[09:28:42] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:29:17] <Dave_Stein> okay I'm useless after that so I'm off to have some Selenium "fun" - Happy Thanksgiving
[09:29:23] <mikesherov> so I'm going to land this unless there are objections: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/836
[09:29:55] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: can we finish with the agenda?
[09:29:55] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: any problems with this one from tj_vantoll1: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/832
[09:29:58] <mikesherov> Oh, sure
[09:30:01] <mikesherov> sorry
[09:30:09] <mikesherov> let's do it
[09:30:14] <jzaefferer> I can't remember what else there was, can't open it :/
[09:30:28] <mikesherov> OK, I got it
[09:30:33] <mikesherov> TestSwarm for 1-9-stable
[09:30:36] <jzaefferer> Thanks
[09:30:38] <mikesherov> Jobs are all there, but take long and mostly fail.
[09:30:49] <jzaefferer> Is Krinkle here?
[09:31:01] <tj_vantoll1> I have to take off for a bit.
[09:31:20] <jzaefferer> We've got better global failure errors now.
[09:31:33] <mikesherov> ok tj_vantoll1 thanks!
[09:32:22] <mikesherov> cool, anything else on that item?
[09:32:40] <jzaefferer> I'm sure Scott would appreciate some help tracking down those test failures
[09:32:46] <mikesherov> I can look into it
[09:33:20] <kborchers> gnarf: around to talk about effects (clip animations)? or anyone else involved in that discussion?
[09:33:44] <jzaefferer> I wondered about clip, too
[09:33:45] <mikesherov> yes, I am
[09:33:57] <mikesherov> so, the things with clip is, it only works on abspos elements
[09:34:03] <mikesherov> which is a showstopper
[09:34:25] <mikesherov> and doesn't effect layout, it's like partial visibility
[09:34:47] <kborchers> hmm, that's an issue
[09:34:55] <jzaefferer> How? Don't we change to absolute positioning for most animations anyway?
[09:35:00] <rworth> can't you abspos the effect'ed element and have a clone in its original place just for layout?
[09:35:04] <rworth> and animate both?
[09:35:14] <kborchers> the layout part was what i meant is an issue
[09:35:19] <kborchers> won't stuff jump then?
[09:35:34] <jzaefferer> I guess it's useless for inline elements then.
[09:35:35] <rworth> that's why you have a div to stand in for it
[09:36:06] <kborchers> that might work
[09:36:24] <jzaefferer> The goal was to not having to have clones, wasn't it?
[09:36:48] <rworth> this is an un-clone
[09:36:56] <jzaefferer> Or generally moving elements around...
[09:37:21] <rworth> the original doesn't move. this un-clone can be put .after() it
[09:37:49] <jzaefferer> For example, blind animate a dialog shouldn't affect focus within the dialog
[09:38:06] <jzaefferer> If that works, it's better than the wrapper
[09:39:16] <mikesherov> right, sorry
[09:39:40] <mikesherov> the discussion we had was creating a ghost element
[09:39:53] <mikesherov> that mantains position while you abspos and animate
[09:40:04] <mikesherov> but that introduces it's own suite of problems
[09:40:24] <rworth> but perhaps fewer/less bad than the wrapper?
[09:40:32] <mikesherov> it's possible
[09:40:57] <mikesherov> and petro expressed interest in trying it out, but it might be a fools errand
[09:41:44] <jzaefferer> Petro?
[09:42:01] <mikesherov> Mike Petrovich from the conference
[09:42:13] <mikesherov> still trying to get him to be more committed / involved
[09:42:42] <mikesherov> but that's another convo
[09:44:03] <kborchers> so we need to decide if someone is going to try this and if so, who
[09:44:03] <mikesherov> so yeah, clip sucks as a strategy
[09:44:31] <mikesherov> not me, petro is interested in trying it out, but no one who's regular contributor that I know has stepped up yet
[09:44:50] <mikesherov> let's punt on it another week
[09:45:06] <kborchers> ok, in the meantime maybe see if petro is still interested?
[09:45:59] <mikesherov> yes, I will
[09:46:03] <kborchers> cool
[09:46:34] <mikesherov> next up
[09:46:34] <kborchers> mikesherov: pull queue
[09:46:47] <mikesherov> Yup, so 26 pulls open
[09:46:55] <mikesherov> there are a few I want to discuss
[09:47:03] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: should I wait till the end?
[09:47:40] <mikesherov> anyway, I just wanted to say, we made good progress on clearing the queue, there are ALOT of code review / large in there that we're working on
[09:47:45] <mikesherov> the rest are mostly stale
[09:48:01] <mikesherov> I updated the clap a week or so ago: updated clap: http://oksoclap.com/ui-pull-requests
[09:48:19] <mikesherov> And in general, I'm going to land pulls that have tests and an active contributor
[09:48:26] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez said it was fine
[09:48:35] <mikesherov> it means short term unstable / long term unstable
[09:48:58] <kborchers> mikesherov: yeah, discussing specific pulls can probably just wait till after in -dev when jzaefferer is at a computer
[09:49:03] <mikesherov> but my goal is to build up a test suite, and work through the known bugs, so when we actually rewrite interactions, we have a good test suite
[09:49:18] <jzaefferer> Long term unstable?
[09:49:28] <mikesherov> HA
[09:49:29] <mikesherov> oops
[09:49:38] <mikesherov> short term unstable / long term stable
[09:50:33] <mikesherov> we need to proactively address the bugs with strong testing
[09:50:40] <mikesherov> and I think it's going to work out well
[09:50:57] <mikesherov> Just letting everyone know that interactions specifically will be unstable short term
[09:51:10] <mikesherov> but I'm not going to revert or land without pulls
[09:51:17] <mikesherov> the goal is always move forward with more testing
[09:51:59] <kborchers> sounds good
[09:52:03] <kborchers> anything else?
[09:52:17] <mikesherov> I think that's it
[09:52:39] <mikesherov> lastly, I just want to apologize for landing some pulls that needed more clean up. I'm still learning :-)
[09:53:24] <kborchers> ok, thanks all. back to -dev
[11:01:35] <gnarf> Hey hey - Infra meeting time - ryanneufeld danheberden clarkbox mikesherov Krinkle et all
[11:01:51] <ryanneufeld> pong
[11:02:06] <Krinkle> pong
[11:02:10] <gnarf> so um, quick update on mergeatron, mikesherov and I are gonna be getting together saturday
[11:02:24] <Krinkle> Anywhere near Europe?
[11:02:39] <gnarf> does IRC count? :)
[11:02:44] <Krinkle> sure
[11:02:57] <gnarf> then yes
[11:03:02] <gnarf> we haven't set a specific time
[11:03:15] <gnarf> but considering the holiday weekend, I should be free most of the day
[11:05:07] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: whats your status on assigned issues?
[11:05:40] <gnarf> I should be able to tackle most of mine this week
[11:06:08] <ryanneufeld> I've been busier than a one-legged man in an but kicking contest
[11:06:30] <ryanneufeld> We had discussed waiting till you returned from asia to tackle most of it
[11:06:54] <ryanneufeld> so I can set some time aside an evening this week, tonight actually works as I'll have the house to myself for a couple hours
[11:07:20] <ryanneufeld> For upgrading puppet I'd rather have you available when I do it, in case it all goes to pot
[11:08:07] <gnarf> sorry, i just lost internet can someone fill me in from my last message?
[11:08:09] <gnarf> jsut in case i missed something?
[11:08:11] <gnarf> also hopefully gf3 will put together a pull request to make the IRC github bot cooler this weekend - I had a few feature requests for it
[11:08:15] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: seems fair, I should be around most of the week - no plans for anything
[11:08:57] <ryanneufeld> I've been busier than a one-legged man in an but kicking contest
[11:08:58] <ryanneufeld> ryanneufeld
[11:08:58] <ryanneufeld> We had discussed waiting till you returned from asia to tackle most of it
[11:08:59] <ryanneufeld> ryanneufeld
[11:09:01] <ryanneufeld> so I can set some time aside an evening this week, tonight actually works as I'll have the house to myself for a couple hours
[11:09:03] <ryanneufeld> 11:07 ryanneufeld
[11:09:05] <ryanneufeld> For upgrading puppet I'd rather have you available when I do it, in case it all goes to pot
[11:09:24] <gnarf> sounds good
[11:09:46] <gnarf> i think i'll be able to tackle all the assigned ones this week
[11:10:31] <ryanneufeld> for #78
[11:10:37] <ryanneufeld> backup plugins db
[11:10:38] <mikesherov> .
[11:11:04] <ryanneufeld> is that still a thing? or is it taken care of with the git repos and the new sites?
[11:11:09] <ryanneufeld> hi mikesherov
[11:11:38] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: we still need to backup the sqllite db's for that
[11:11:48] <ryanneufeld> ok
[11:12:05] <ryanneufeld> get me the location you want em backed up to
[11:12:15] <ryanneufeld> and I'll add the cron to the puppet confs
[11:12:24] <ryanneufeld> *if you can get me
[11:15:29] <gnarf> I still haven't really figured out where we want to store backups for that stuff yet (and also boo my wireless today)
[11:15:31] <gnarf> maybe citadel?
[11:15:41] <ryanneufeld> hm
[11:15:43] <ryanneufeld> maybe
[11:15:56] <ryanneufeld> where does citadel backup to?
[11:16:28] <gnarf> well all the (mt) servers backup
[11:16:33] <gnarf> to (mt)
[11:17:04] <ryanneufeld> okay, so is it really neccessary to back them up off the server?
[11:17:35] <gnarf> probably best to do so just to make sure we have a semi-live version of it immediately
[11:17:48] <ryanneufeld> ok
[11:17:52] <ryanneufeld> citadel it is
[11:18:05] <gnarf> maybe backup the backups from citadel to ps01?
[11:19:04] * ryanneufeld looks up ps01
[11:19:49] <ryanneufeld> which one is ps01?>
[11:19:56] <gnarf> ps01 is the "stage" machine for citadel
[11:20:02] <ryanneufeld> oic
[11:20:23] <ryanneufeld> hm
[11:20:28] <ryanneufeld> I suppose that could work
[11:20:33] <ryanneufeld> as long as storage isn't an issue
[11:21:02] <gnarf> i don't think we are backing up anything too large
[11:21:30] <ryanneufeld> okay, well lets say that's the plan then, baring larger files
[11:22:08] <gnarf> any other major business?
[11:22:11] <gnarf> ajpiano: are you there?
[11:22:25] <ajpiano> aye
[11:22:33] <gnarf> learn today?
[11:22:45] <ajpiano> yeah, finishing up some docs on the site
[11:22:50] <ajpiano> then gonna tag everything
[11:23:18] <ajpiano> will you be around the rest of the day/tonight in case anything goes haywire?
[11:23:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: yea
[11:26:03] <ajpiano> great, we'll be in touch :p
[11:26:23] <gnarf> well, in lieu of more items to discuss - see you in -infra!
[11:26:36] <ryanneufeld> caio
