[14:00:18] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[14:00:32] <geekman-rohit> hey\
[14:00:34] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, arschmitz, kristyjy
[14:01:57] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:02:27] <geekman-rohit> nothing there?
[14:02:35] <sfrisk> (yeahhhhhh, haven't put much in yet)
[14:03:06] <sfrisk> First off, we're going through some edits on an HTML style guide PR on Contribute
[14:03:41] <sfrisk> Since this project kiiiinda cares about html, feel free to comment on the PR about anything you think needs to get added: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/117
[14:06:06] <sfrisk> scott_gonzalez has been kicking butt today going through the PR, but I think it would be good if we helped out
[14:06:52] <sfrisk> just as a repeat since I think geekman-rohit got dropped:

[14:07:02] <sfrisk> scott_gonzalez has been kicking butt today going through the PR, but I think it would be good if we helped out
[14:08:50] <sfrisk> On the Palette Front: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/140/files
[14:09:10] <sfrisk> If people like the looks of that, I'll pull it in
[14:09:36] <geekman-rohit> I think we can pull that in
[14:09:43] <sfrisk> ok
[14:10:01] <sfrisk> I'll do that right after the meeting so you can use it for typography, and any other PR people have been working on
[14:10:14] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk if you pull it in now I'll keep my prs ready for pull in by next meeting
[14:10:23] <geekman-rohit> sounds good :)
[14:10:40] <sfrisk> It's about a 5 minute process so it shouldn't take me too long
[14:10:45] <sfrisk> I can PM you once it's up
[14:10:50] <sfrisk> Buttons PR is also updated: http://view.css-chassis.com/96-buttons-take-two/demos/buttons.html
[14:10:55] <geekman-rohit> yep
[14:11:13] <sfrisk> Biggest changes include the "Default" button states
[14:11:29] <sfrisk> Anchor link examples, input[type=submit] examples
[14:11:31] <sfrisk> Block buttons
[14:11:35] <sfrisk> and a button bar example
[14:12:10] <sfrisk> the way I did button bar's css though might have to change, depending on what we decide is best practices for our naming convention
[14:12:46] <geekman-rohit> no change on hover to default button
[14:13:28] <sfrisk> yeah there is
[14:14:39] <sfrisk> "base": "#FAFAFA",  //base
[14:14:40] <sfrisk> "light": "#FFFFFF", //hover
[14:14:40] <sfrisk> "dark": "#FAFAFA", //active
[14:14:41] <sfrisk> "darker": "#F5F5F5" //focus
[14:15:27] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/blob/96-buttons-take-two/scss/atoms/buttons/_buttons.scss#L24
[14:15:34] <sfrisk> That's how I handled btn-group
[14:15:46] <sfrisk> buuuut that also depends on cascading, which is a goal we were trying to avoid
[14:16:11] <sfrisk> so I was thinking we might have ".btn-group--btn" class that could apply the .btn styles within that group
[14:16:18] <sfrisk> but that could get a bit crazy with all the classes
[14:23:12] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit -- palette has been merged
[14:24:33] <sfrisk> also kristyjy
[14:25:16] <geekman-rohit> thats great!
[14:25:45] <kristyjy> yes?
[14:27:17] <sfrisk> more just a note that the palette has been merged
[14:27:34] <sfrisk> I know you talked about wanting to take issues on, so that's available for use now
[14:27:40] <kristyjy> oh sweet sorry I'm in another meeting :)
[14:28:17] <sfrisk> That's fine
[14:28:27] <sfrisk> seems we can't get a break on meeting times
[14:29:26] <sfrisk> but if everyone could review buttons PR - I think the way I handled btn-group should be done differently so it doesn't rely on cascading
[14:30:45] <sfrisk> I added my note about that in the PR
[14:34:00] <kristyjy> cool I'll definitely take time to review the PR and pick out an issue to work on as well. I never know when I'm going to be in a meeting it seems lol
[14:35:26] <sfrisk> The Joys of Meetings
[14:35:39] <sfrisk> It's look the Joy of Cooking, only Agile
[14:36:40] <geekman-rohit> so we are not keeping any projects for gsoc?
[14:36:50] <geekman-rohit> we could do with some additional help
[14:37:34] <geekman-rohit> we could have a project that helps us with forms and other components
[14:37:58] <sfrisk> Would you be willing to mentor?
[14:38:10] <sfrisk> I hadn't put us down mostly because I haven't really had the time lately to do mentoring
[14:38:25] <geekman-rohit> we could all look after it
[14:38:41] <sfrisk> Well there are some admin side of gsoc that mentoring involves
[14:38:58] <geekman-rohit> I can live with that
[14:39:17] <sfrisk> I also hesitated mostly because I'm not entirely certain what state the project will be in May
[14:39:27] <sfrisk> last year we thought the project would be a lot further along than it ended up being
[14:39:50] <sfrisk> So the proposals we suggested/looked at focused on "Phase Two" needs
[14:40:45] <sfrisk> We could ask for Phase One items, but I would like Phase One to be done before May - but I don't want to leave a student in an awkward situation if the project isn't where we thought it would be by then
[14:41:20] <geekman-rohit> but
[14:41:25] <geekman-rohit> if we have prospective students
[14:41:32] <geekman-rohit> there will be a lot more activity happening
[14:41:41] <geekman-rohit> we will have help in phase one as well
[14:41:54] <geekman-rohit> we ask for phase one and phase two items
[14:42:00] <geekman-rohit> Form and phase 2 components
[14:42:53] <sfrisk> Well, we could get a google doc together and we could brainstorm over the next week projects we could have people work on
[14:43:00] <sfrisk> that we feel would take over the course of the summer to do
[14:43:42] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:43:48] <geekman-rohit> I'll set it up
[14:43:55] <sfrisk> Sounds good
[14:45:15] <geekman-rohit> https://docs.google.com/a/rohit.codes/document/d/1VzraSbBH9MnGLQgNbLtcwcx3swiUuQOpktnYGRA_BfM/edit?usp=sharing
[14:45:27] <geekman-rohit> people might have to request access
[14:47:33] <sfrisk> access requested
[14:47:45] <geekman-rohit> yo
[14:52:37] <sfrisk> okay, I have a meeting I need to go to soon, I will probably pick up another issue while buttons is under review
[14:53:42] <sfrisk> see everyone on the boards/next week
