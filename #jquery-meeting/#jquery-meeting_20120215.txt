[08:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> Let's do this (again) :-)
[08:59:18] * kborchers hides to make scott_gonzalez think he has the wrong day again :P
[08:59:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm on top of it today :-)
[08:59:50] <kborchers> heh
[08:59:57] <jzaefferer> Aloha
[08:59:59] <kborchers> getting coffee back in a minute
[09:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> I've made some more progress on the accordion animations
[09:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/587
[09:01:31] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (2w, 1d ago): Accordion: Attempt at improving animation.
[09:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> If heightStyle != "content" then we force the height on the accordion.
[09:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> That prevents content below from shuffling during animation if the browser STILL can't get the dimensions right.
[09:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> I also came up with a new API for the animations, with help from ajpiano
[09:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> animated: false => no animation
[09:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> animated: easingName => defined easing, default duration
[09:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> animated: duration => default easing, defined duration
[09:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> animated: { easing: easingName, duration: duration } => defined easing, defined duration
[09:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> animated: { easing ..., duration: ..., down: { easing: ... duration: ... } } => different animation for "up" and "down"
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> down = activating a panel with a lower index than the currently active index.
[09:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> You can see an example of that with the existing animated: bounceslide option
[09:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> For down, you can also specify just an easing or a duration and it will inherit the other value from the up animation.
[09:03:08] * ajpiano gets that deja vu feeling :p
[09:03:44] <jzaefferer> what's with the "// TODO: animation option"?
[09:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to call the option animation, but we're going to stick with the existing name of animated
[09:05:00] <jzaefferer> also I don't see "bounceslide" anywhere, just "// TODO: back compat for bounceslide"
[09:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that old API won't exist.
[09:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> You won't be able to say animated: "bounceslide" in 2.0.
[09:05:40] <jzaefferer> awww
[09:05:46] <jzaefferer> no more bouncy slidy :(
[09:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> You'll have to use { down: { easing: "easeOutBounce", duration: 1000 } }
[09:05:49] <rworth> I thought animate
[09:05:52] <rworth> not animated
[09:06:05] <jzaefferer> ah, well, that works
[09:06:19] <jzaefferer> will you put that in a demo?
[09:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right, animate for the option name
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:06:30] <jzaefferer> also, I don't think you should bother with backwards compat for that
[09:07:00] <rworth> no
[09:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> I was just going to do BC for aniamted: "bounceslide"
[09:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> I wasn't going to do full BC for the old animation API
[09:07:44] <jzaefferer> so just an if for that one setting? that's okay I guess
[09:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> Since bouceslide was built-in and the API was really obsure.
[09:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:07:56] <jzaefferer> easy enough with the new API
[09:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 isn't supposed to have any breaking changes by deafult.
[09:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ANOTHER spelling for default :-)
[09:09:15] <rworth> ;)
[09:09:57] <jzaefferer> so rename once more, add BC for bounceslide, anything else missing?
[09:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> Don't think so. This will close out the last two animation bugs.
[09:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get the BC in and land it in master.
[09:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> FINALLY :-D
[09:11:09] <rworth> yay
[09:11:12] <kborchers> ?eval hi5("scott_gonzalez", "kborchers")
[09:11:13] <bot-t> kborchers: "scott_gonzalez _o/\o_ kborchers"
[09:12:02] <kborchers> it looks really good, you did a lot of good work on that scott!
[09:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:12:52] <rworth> yeahwaytogo
[09:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> Next on the list is autocomplete sync change, but we've already gotten enough reviews of that now.
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> So that will be landing in master as well.
[09:13:50] <jzaefferer> nice
[09:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> We've still got some failing unit tests.
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have ideas why the tests are failing?
[09:15:07] <kborchers> is it just the effects test in IE?
[09:15:26] <jzaefferer> Not really, though once I'm through with QUnit, I'll start focussing on UI again, tooltip first, can look into failing tests as part of that as well
[09:15:38] <jzaefferer> Also want to get a grip on the whole TestSwarm-BrowserStack integration
[09:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Those are the most consistently failing.
[09:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> IE 6 errors out a lot though: http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=4930&client_id=8560
[09:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=4933&client_id=8562
[09:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> But the tests seem to work fine when running manually
[09:18:04] <rworth> have we tried multiple different clients?
[09:18:17] <rworth> could it be an issue with the browser being minimized?
[09:18:59] <kborchers> ummm, any reason i would get this when i run tests via browserstack manually? http://gyazo.com/4fea8ed0dce74ae6f487a17457ddb6ab
[09:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[09:21:42] <kborchers> maybe it's just an old commit? chrome says no new tests to run
[09:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> maybe
[09:22:34] <kborchers> heh, github explodes in IE6
[09:23:53] <kborchers> yeah, looks like that commit is from 2 months ago
[09:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> I started testing out the new build process, but I couldn't get make to ever finish the build.
[09:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Any ideas?
[09:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking we'll push 1.8.18 with the ant script, and focus on make for 1.8.19.
[09:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> I guess he's not around.
[09:28:12] <kborchers> i know a lot of work has already been put in but has anyone considered ben's grunt for our new build process?
[09:28:45] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I'm considering it for QUnit and my validation plugin; Richard talked with Ben about grund and UI
[09:29:07] <jzaefferer> seems to suffer from the 1:m mismatch, where grunt assumes just a single plugin in one repo
[09:29:24] <kborchers> oh, ok.
[09:29:38] <kborchers> yeah, i've only played a little bit with it but seems really cool
[09:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Want to talk about tooltip?
[09:33:44] <jzaefferer> Sure, once I'm done with the QUnit updates, that's what I want to start working on for UI
[09:33:50] <jzaefferer> mostly those two TODOs
[09:34:01] <jzaefferer> Will review unit tests and stuff on the way
[09:34:10] <jzaefferer> Make sure that widget is ready for 1.9
[09:34:20] <jzaefferer> Should have more to report next week
[09:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> Tooltip is in pretty good shape, so hopefully it'll be "done" within a few weeks :-)
[09:35:37] <jzaefferer> Well, depending on progress of the API docs, I'd also work on documentation
[09:36:11] <jzaefferer> nothing there on mediawiki for tooltip, just a redirect that leads nowhere
[09:37:13] <rworth> jzaefferer: go ahead and write up documentation for tooltip using the existing xml schema
[09:37:17] <rworth> I can use it as a test case
[09:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://gist.github.com/978804#file_tooltip.txt
[09:37:39] <jzaefferer> ah, you ripped that out?
[09:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. I have no idea how accurate it is though.
[09:38:05] <jzaefferer> well, I can at least reuse some of the descriptions, no need to write those from scratch
[09:38:17] <jzaefferer> rworth: into the docs/xml repo then?
[09:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> The planning wiki should have accurate docs though.
[09:38:31] <rworth> yeah
[09:40:23] <jzaefferer> okay, updated that on the wiki
[09:41:21] <jzaefferer> guess that's it for today then
[09:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yup. Anyone have anything else?
[09:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we're done.
