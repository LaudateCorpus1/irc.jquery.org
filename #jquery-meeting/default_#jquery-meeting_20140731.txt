[11:00:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: gseguin|away jasperdegroot cgack agcolom meeting time!
[11:01:04] * gabriel_schulhof waves
[11:01:26] <cgack> howdy
[11:04:44] <arschmitz> ok so i guess its just the three of us today
[11:05:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[11:05:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Looks like ...
[11:05:11] <jasperdegroot> I am here now
[11:05:19] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:05:26] <cgack> hi jasperdegroot
[11:06:06] <arschmitz> ok lets start with anything related to 1.4.4
[11:06:15] <arschmitz> we landed a bunch of prs for 1.4.4 this week
[11:06:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Yessir! Thanks for those reviews!
[11:06:28] <arschmitz> lets make sure we have those on both 1.4 stable and master
[11:06:47] <gabriel_schulhof> [âœ“]
[11:07:05] <cgack> yep i'm finishing up the PRs arschmitz reviewed this AM
[11:07:14] <cgack> and adding tests for toolbar
[11:07:36] <arschmitz> any one see any new regressions this week?
[11:08:19] <arschmitz> unless we missed a label all regressions are fixed
[11:08:21] <gabriel_schulhof> There was one.
[11:08:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, the checkbox disabling one.
[11:08:33] <gabriel_schulhof> I think the fix for that has already landed.
[11:08:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[11:10:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I love the new GH search! Finally!
[11:10:20] <arschmitz> we still have 34 open issues for 1.4.4
[11:10:36] <arschmitz> we should try and go through and decide which ones we intend to actually fix for 1.4.4
[11:10:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Woah! You've reviewed some more PRs.
[11:11:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[11:11:22] <arschmitz> and there are still 14 1.4.4 prs open
[11:11:23] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll land whatever I can and let's see how many issues that leaves.
[11:11:39] <cgack> i say fix them all! - deploy at Chicago
[11:11:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Boo yah!
[11:11:55] <arschmitz> cgack: maybe it is coming right up
[11:12:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You need a big red button with a molly-guard.
[11:12:10] <arschmitz> lol
[11:13:02] <arschmitz> i still have a few 1.4.4 pr's to review
[11:13:38] <arschmitz> but i think most are looking good at this point
[11:14:08] <cgack> this toolbar _destroy PR keeps growing (probably a good thing)
[11:15:43] <arschmitz> cgack: yeah
[11:16:36] <arschmitz> ok and any 1.5 progress from anyone
[11:17:54] <cgack> nothing on navbar from me
[11:17:54] <arschmitz> cgack: for navbar im just going to pull your changes in your pr into the branch so they can be all in one place
[11:18:00] <arschmitz> its to hard to review a pr on a pr
[11:18:06] <cgack> good call
[11:19:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Just one thing.
[11:19:34] <gabriel_schulhof> For nav, can we have some unique identifier for each history entry whenever pushState is enabled>
[11:19:37] <gabriel_schulhof> ?
[11:20:00] <gabriel_schulhof> That way, we can distinguish between accesses to a given page. Like a -> b -> a -> c.
[11:20:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: makes sense
[11:21:15] <gabriel_schulhof> I find that this fundamental limitation we have now makes it difficult to implement same-page navigation right now, and it's generally not good.
[11:21:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Of course, pure-hashchange will still be navigationally challenged - shall we say.
[11:21:47] <gabriel_schulhof> No way around that.
[11:22:19] <arschmitz> yeah it has its limitations
[11:22:33] <arschmitz> but less and less browsers require it now
[11:22:36] <gabriel_schulhof> How many pure-hashchange browsers are left in our supported list?
[11:25:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Want me to make a PR on this topic? ... or does it need some coordination with your changes?
[11:25:54] <arschmitz> hmm good question
[11:26:03] <arschmitz> file an issue
[11:26:04] <gabriel_schulhof> I think I can restrict myself to navigation - i.e., I don't think I need to touch pagecontainer.
[11:26:10] <arschmitz> and send me a link im working on a document ill add it
[11:26:15] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:26:50] <gabriel_schulhof> I can make a PR and then we can fold it in. I don't even mind if it gets discarded altogether in the end, if we find a better way.
[11:27:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sounds good
[11:28:12] <arschmitz> ok iv been working on selectmenu still and a nav document mostly
[11:28:19] <arschmitz> and reviews
[11:28:26] <arschmitz> any one else have anything?
[11:29:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Just a small thing.
[11:29:23] <gabriel_schulhof> frequent has added his voice to the list of people asking for a generic replacement for clearBtn.
[11:29:32] <gabriel_schulhof> The list is now two people long :)
[11:30:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[11:30:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Maybe we should do a demo with a pre-rendered textinput and a "clear button".
[11:30:42] <arschmitz> we can consider adding something for 1.5
[11:30:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm certainly game for that.
[11:30:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Issue/PR?
[11:31:41] <arschmitz> open an issue for discussion
[11:31:50] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:34:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, we already have an issue, opened by frequent: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7601
[11:35:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cool that works
[11:35:27] <arschmitz> ok anything else?
[11:36:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Not on my end.
[11:36:33] <arschmitz> anything from the community
[11:37:37] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back on -dev
