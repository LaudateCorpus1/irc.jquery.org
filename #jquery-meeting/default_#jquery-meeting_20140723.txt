[09:02:06] <petersendidit> hey
[09:02:12] <fnagel> hez
[09:02:12] <b-ot> fnagel: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:02:13] <jperrault> hello
[09:02:32] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:03:30] <fnagel> `read
[09:03:30] <b-ot> fnagel: From scott_gonzalez, 2w 1d ago: Please make sure to always use tabs for indentation. I'm getting lots of conflicts because of this.
[09:04:19] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I assume there's nothing new for button. Still waiting for feedback on the recent updates, right?
[09:05:19] <arschmitz> Actually about to push branch you asked for
[09:05:49] <arschmitz> Allowing parent label
[09:06:10] <arschmitz> And started working on the focus style stuff
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:07:10] <arschmitz> That's it
[09:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Did my comment make sense about the commit to clean up the first commit in the calendar split?
[09:07:34] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Yes and no
[09:07:45] <fnagel> I wanted to contact you via skype but was too busy
[09:08:01] <fnagel> Perhaps tomorrow?
[09:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:08:20] <fnagel> Nice
[09:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> We still have six regressions: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=!closed&keywords=~regression&report=40
[09:09:14] <tj_vantoll> I think we should revert https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/f0b4967
[09:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> I fixed another one this week (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10152, huge pain to track down), but another was came in today.
[09:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to spend a little time looking into that, but if I couldn't find a proper fix quickly, reverting was my thought too.
[09:11:01] <tj_vantoll> A proper fix isn't simple, and #5816 is trivial (and fixed with the rewrite).
[09:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Is the trigger just to get this code to run? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/datepicker.js#L2003
[09:13:24] <tj_vantoll> yeah
[09:13:42] <tj_vantoll> So you could probably abstract that into a method.
[09:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:13:53] <scott_gonzalez> I never understood why the hover class got applied anyway.
[09:14:26] <tj_vantoll> I'll take a stab at abstracting that method.
[09:14:59] <tj_vantoll> I spent some time with the menu focus regression with nothing to show for it.
[09:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think we may need to require the menu item wrappers.
[09:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> Which sucks.
[09:17:16] <tj_vantoll> I went down that route and it's non-trivial.
[09:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's practically going back to what we had before.
[09:17:46] <tj_vantoll> Yeah
[09:17:58] <tj_vantoll> We won't require it in the user's markup though at least.
[09:18:09] <tj_vantoll> But that presents its own challenges.
[09:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we should make it optional.
[09:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> If it needs to be there, we should require the user to put it there.
[09:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise it becomes a pain to deal with.
[09:18:51] <tj_vantoll> ugh
[09:19:12] <arschmitz> im inclined to agree thats a lot of wrapping to do on startup otherwise
[09:19:28] <tj_vantoll> Ok
[09:19:59] <tj_vantoll> I can create a PR that takes that approach.
[09:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise we'd need to do something like `menuitem.children().not( this.options.menu ).wrap( "<div></div>" )`
[09:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> Or probably <span>
[09:21:13] <tj_vantoll> It has to be block so that icons work.
[09:21:40] <tj_vantoll> So a <div> probably makes more sense.
[09:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> Who thinks we should require the user to do the wrapping?
[09:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> And who thinks we should do it automatically?
[09:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> +1 user
[09:25:01] <arschmitz> +1 user
[09:25:37] <tj_vantoll> +1 user, although it pains me to type that
[09:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we'll go with user requirement.
[09:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> I hate it too, but I hate it a lot less than the widget doing it.
[09:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> I was so happy when we dropped the wrapping.
[09:26:44] <arschmitz> yeah in mobile we have had so many complaints about to much dom manip
[09:26:55] <arschmitz> with wrapping things
[09:27:06] <tj_vantoll> We probably need to wait until 1.12 because this will be another breaking change.
[09:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> We may want to push 1.12 very soon though for this.
[09:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> Nested menus are pretty much visually broken now.
[09:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> Funny that even though we're not following semver yet, we're still strict about what can go into patch releases :-P
[09:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that's 2 of the 6 open regressions.
[09:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Any updates on the interactions or effect regressions?
[09:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> Guess he's not around.
[09:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> I updated the jQuery UI Dialog + Bootstrap CSS example by using the classes option: http://jsbin.com/hutenedo/1/edit
[09:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard anything from the Boostrap team since then (it's been 6 days so far)
[09:35:14] <jperrault> last week you mentioned setting up a meeting with the polymer guys re: web components.  Any update?
[09:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll was supposed to ping Addy about it.
[09:36:53] <tj_vantoll> Yeah and I haven't yet. I wanted to put a list of things we wanted to talk about first and I haven't yet. I'll get to that this week.
[09:37:42] <jperrault> I'm working on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9264 (accordion).  I've address the content sizing, and am working on the "snap" issue now.  There is a PR (#1287), but a merge is pending both issues being fixed.
[09:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: The snapping is probably related to the custom animation.
[09:39:41] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: that's what it looks like, trying to catch exactly where in that process it is happening.
[09:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> Probably here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/accordion.js#L546
[09:40:37] <jperrault> There was  jquery fix (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13543) that happens just before the animation, but I don't think it is part of the problem.
[09:41:31] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe it needs to use something other than .outerHeight() depending on the box sizing.
[09:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> Or perhaps https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/accordion.js#L532 is what needs to change based on the box sizing.
[09:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> Or it could be that `adjust` needs to be conditionally updated.
[09:44:20] <jperrault> lol - that's exactly my breakpoint atm.
[09:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> Conditionally updating `adjust` is probably the right thing to do.
[09:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> content-box = all props, padding-box = exclude padding, border-box = exclude all
[09:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
