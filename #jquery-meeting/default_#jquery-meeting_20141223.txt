[10:04:10] <sfrisk> today's agenda: https://docs.google.com/a/sarahfrisk.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit#gid=868130442
[10:04:17] <isaacdurazo> hey kborchers
[10:04:35] <kborchers> hey isaacdurazo just thought you might be interested in this meeting on tuesdays
[10:04:48] <sfrisk> It's the Chassis meeting
[10:05:11] <helen> just wanted to note that i'm lurking/observing, more or less for the purposes of WP. :)
[10:05:18] <sfrisk> Okay! :-)
[10:05:34] <isaacdurazo> kborchers: I can't today but count me in next Tuesday
[10:05:35] <isaacdurazo> :/
[10:06:15] <sfrisk> Actually, on that topic, I won't be around a reliable internet connection next Tuesday due to the holidays, do we want to cancel next week's meeting, or does someone else want to lead it?
[10:07:21] <arschmitz> I doubt there will be much work going on in between now and then
[10:07:27] <DaveMethvin> sfrisk: here, kinda ::)
[10:07:36] <sfrisk> probably
[10:07:48] <DaveMethvin> oh the joy of being a team leader during the holidays
[10:08:02] <DaveMethvin> herding cats
[10:08:08] <sfrisk> haha
[10:08:22] <arschmitz> Ill be around if people want a meeting and are around but i really don't see there being a need
[10:08:48] <sfrisk> Holidays tend to be a tough time in general. :-/
[10:09:14] <isaacdurazo> yeah, that;s my situation right now
[10:09:16] <isaacdurazo> :/
[10:09:26] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SmgLtg1Izw
[10:09:41] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:09:52] <sfrisk> arschmitz, nice!
[10:11:30] <sfrisk> Okay, so probably no meeting next Tuesday, unless something comes up where we need to discuss something
[10:12:07] <sfrisk> but I'll see all of you the sixth of January
[10:13:23] <sfrisk> Okay, so on the topic of Naming Conventions, last meeting we decided on BEM, but there was some discussion on the actual class names
[10:13:44] <sfrisk> if we wanted to go with double dashes for example
[10:14:09] <sfrisk> veged had some suggestions in the thread, that I wanted some input on how people felt about them
[10:14:19] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/4#issuecomment-67314921
[10:14:26] <sfrisk> ManyWordsBlock
[10:14:26] <sfrisk> ManyWordsBlock_someModifier
[10:14:26] <sfrisk> ManyWordsBlock_someModifier_withValue
[10:14:28] <sfrisk> ManyWordsBlock-anyElem
[10:14:30] <sfrisk> ManyWordsBlock-anyElem_someModifier
[10:14:32] <sfrisk> ManyWordsBlock-anyElem_someModifier_withValue
[10:15:21] <arschmitz> So one thing Kristofer mentioned when i was talking with him is that the reason topcoat went with the double dashes and unerscores
[10:15:37] <arschmitz> was to make it easy to use regex's on class names
[10:17:04] <joebot0101> good point
[10:17:37] <sfrisk> I'll admit, the double dashes are kiiinda growing on me
[10:19:17] <arschmitz> im not strongly opinionated on this at all honestly
[10:20:00] <sfrisk> I've been thinking about it over the past week a little bit - I almost prefer double dashes + dashes instead of camel case plus dashes
[10:20:35] <arschmitz> im not a big fan of camel case in classes
[10:20:55] <arschmitz> thats like my easy this is a js var not a class check lol
[10:21:04] <sfrisk> lol
[10:22:07] <arschmitz> maybe just because thats what im used to because its what jquery projects require
[10:23:21] <sfrisk> well how about we stick with dashes/double dashes then?
[10:23:36] <arschmitz> im fine with that
[10:23:46] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll post it on the issue and close it then
[10:24:10] <sfrisk> unless anyone else has an opinion?
[10:24:24] <arschmitz> but bytes!
[10:24:28] <arschmitz> lol
[10:24:58] <sfrisk> lol
[10:25:11] <sfrisk> anyone besides arschmitz and his bytes?
[10:25:14] <sfrisk> or myself
[10:25:29] <joebot0101> nope, seems practical
[10:28:00] <sfrisk> And I think there was talk about using OOCSS or SMACSS as a design pattern
[10:29:22] <arschmitz> I have not really looked at the differences yet
[10:29:37] <sfrisk> although design patterns for the css files might be beyond the scope of that original backlog
[10:32:49] <arschmitz> yeah maybe a new issue for that
[10:33:26] <sfrisk> okay
[10:35:12] <sfrisk> okay, anything else on performance testing? I know there was some discussion about it in the issue thread last week
[10:35:22] <sfrisk> since last week we decided we would do things internally
[10:36:13] <kborchers> nope nothing yet https://twitter.com/kborchers/status/547453502964781056
[10:36:13] <b-ot> kborchers: @kborchers: @dam @brianleroux any news on the perf testing for chassis? would love to get those going. meeting in #jquery-meeting on irc now if avail
[10:37:16] <arschmitz> kborchers: dam commented and iv talked to him
[10:37:40] <arschmitz> theres actually been a lot of discussion in the issue including an offer from the creator of perfjankie to help
[10:38:02] <arschmitz> I got the testing setup working after the last meeting
[10:38:16] <arschmitz> but after that offer i invited them to join meeting today
[10:39:49] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/2#issuecomment-67235478
[10:41:25] <sfrisk> yeah, there was definitely a lot of chatter last week after the meeting
[10:43:09] <arschmitz> I think the next step
[10:43:12] <sfrisk> but it is like 2 days before christmas, so I can understand if it was difficult to make this meeting
[10:43:17] <arschmitz> is deciding what we want for test pages
[10:43:22] <arschmitz> for other frameworks
[10:43:32] <arschmitz> once we have that we can actually start this
[10:43:41] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:44:49] <sfrisk> do we want a new issue for that? to come up with the list of frameworks?
[10:44:58] <arschmitz> Not just frameworks
[10:45:07] <arschmitz> but what exactly the test pages will contain
[10:45:26] <arschmitz> will they be individual components
[10:45:33] <arschmitz> or like a kitchen sink
[10:45:51] <arschmitz> and if a kitchen sink since different frameworks include more or less components we will need to find a common set
[10:46:29] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:46:43] <arschmitz> because to make the comparison actually usable we need to make sure we are testing the exact same thing in each framework
[10:46:59] <sfrisk> Definitely
[10:48:21] <arschmitz> Personally i think both are useful though
[10:48:37] <sfrisk> Okay, so I can either make a note about that on the current task - or create a new one to help establish this stuff separate from the actual performance testing task
[10:48:38] <arschmitz> the kitchen sink gives you a general kinda score for the framework as a whole
[10:49:05] <arschmitz> i think a note here
[10:49:14] <arschmitz> and then maybe we can just revrence that from #2
[10:49:24] <sfrisk> okay
[10:51:01] <sfrisk> okay, also in yay news, isaacdurazo said he would have time to work on the logo after the 5th of January
[10:51:03] <sfrisk> yaaaaaay
[10:51:12] <arschmitz> Sweet!
[10:51:18] <isaacdurazo> yaaay!
[10:51:21] <isaacdurazo> :D
[10:52:30] <sfrisk> Anyone else have anything else to say regarding https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/28 ?
[10:52:49] <sfrisk> If not, I'll merge in that pull request
[10:54:04] <arschmitz> sfrisk: those are on every jquery repo right now just check with agcolom its ready
[10:54:14] <sfrisk> ok
[10:55:15] <sfrisk> Okay, 6 minutes left, the other things on the docket were build system and online download builder and investigate unit testing fromework for SASS
[10:55:24] <sfrisk> which both have had a bit of discussion occuring around them
[10:55:45] <arschmitz> I very strongly believe we should have a robust online builder
[10:55:56] <sfrisk> but I'm inclined to hold off on that for next meeting, mostly because I feel these are larger discussions, and would like a few more people here for it
[10:56:06] <sfrisk> But I do agree with arschmitz
[10:56:27] <arschmitz> I think this is really pretty far out at this point to
[10:56:38] <arschmitz> we need something to build before we need an online builder :-)
[10:57:02] <sfrisk> trueee
[10:57:19] <sfrisk> I figured I would bring them up though, since people have been passionate on these topics lately though
[10:57:37] <sfrisk> and stuff like an online builder does tie a little bit on how we build things
[10:57:37] <arschmitz> oh yeah i mean all for discussion just saying
[10:57:49] <arschmitz> its not like we need to decide and make a final decision right off
[10:57:52] <sfrisk> true
[10:58:02] <sfrisk> welp, in that case, I think that's everything on the list
[10:59:27] <sfrisk> see you guys on the 6th of January!  Happy holidays and New Year and all that jazz :-D
