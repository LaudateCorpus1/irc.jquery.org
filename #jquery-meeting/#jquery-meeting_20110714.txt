[11:01:18] <scottjehl> hiyo
[11:01:24] <gseguin> yo
[11:01:48] <toddparker> guess this wasn't moderated?
[11:01:56] <toddparker> who left dat door open?
[11:02:03] <toddparker> anyhoo
[11:02:30] <toddparker> Hey all - jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting now
[11:02:38] <toddparker> we're talking about the new "transitions" branch
[11:02:45] <toddparker> doing some review and testing now
[11:03:47] <toddparker> this is the branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/transitions
[11:03:51] <scottjehl> diff here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/transitions
[11:04:15] <scottjehl> 143 additions and 174 deletions makes me happy
[11:04:25] <toddparker> so to get caught up, we were discussing how to make opera smooth
[11:04:37] <toddparker> while still keeping h.w acceleration for webkit
[11:05:04] <toddparker> miketaylr and nimbu had some ideas they were going to try today
[11:05:44] <gseguin> miketaylr suggested adding -webkit-transform:translateZ(0) to trigger h/w accel
[11:06:57] <toddparker> any luck with that?
[11:07:31] <gseguin> I can't tell, I need to go back to without it to compare
[11:07:53] <toddparker> 20
[11:07:59] <toddparker> sorry, ignore that
[11:08:05] <gseguin> I don't know if it's because of the ease-in-ease-out, it looks choppy to me
[11:08:30] <scottjehl> yeah choppy on iphone right now
[11:08:50] <scottjehl> without the hw fix
[11:08:55] <scottjehl> did you push that?
[11:08:59] <gseguin> I added .animate { -webkit-transform:translateZ(0); }
[11:09:05] <gseguin> nope not pushed yet
[11:09:12] <gseguin> let me push it
[11:09:14] <scottjehl> without it, it's super choppy on my iphone
[11:09:19] <scottjehl> you weren't seeing that?
[11:09:44] <gseguin> I don't have an iPhone
[11:11:11] <toddparker> ah
[11:11:45] <gseguin> I just pushed to transitions
[11:12:02] <scottjehl> k
[11:12:55] <gseguin> brb
[11:13:03] <toddparker> seems worse, or at least not better
[11:13:26] <miketaylr> heh
[11:13:27] <miketaylr> lovely
[11:13:31] <scottjehl> yeah. choppy
[11:13:41] <toddparker> what to do...what to do
[11:14:47] <scottjehl> can we switch over to translateX and test there too?
[11:14:58] <scottjehl> we've got a pile of devices here to check it on
[11:15:23] <toddparker> let's keep testing this today and continue the chat over in -dev after we do a rundown here
[11:15:27] <toddparker> sounds like a plan?
[11:15:40] <scottjehl> ya
[11:15:43] <toddparker> miketaylr and nimbu, you around to help today?
[11:15:43] <miketaylr> yeah, i think nimbu is going to do more testing today with her iPad as well
[11:15:49] <toddparker> kewl
[11:15:50] <nimbu> yeah
[11:16:07] <toddparker> ok, so we'll crank on this today and see where we get
[11:16:31] <toddparker> what other big items are we trying ot nail down for beta 2?
[11:16:48] <toddparker> scott - the dom size, preload
[11:17:12] <toddparker> brw - we got a new palm touchpad today for testing
[11:17:15] <toddparker> webos looks great
[11:17:17] <toddparker> 3.0
[11:17:21] <scottjehl> it's awesome ya
[11:17:40] <scottjehl> that branch: I just need to simplify the code now that Bender landed the loadPage fix
[11:17:45] <scottjehl> so, less code
[11:17:46] <scottjehl> :)
[11:17:48] <scottjehl> quik fix
[11:18:08] <toddparker> that is dom size
[11:18:13] <toddparker> and prelaod is a small one too
[11:18:16] <toddparker> right?
[11:18:22] <toddparker> hey _nickel - you here?
[11:18:29] <toddparker> guess not
[11:19:11] <toddparker> my goal is to get the majority of coded landed next week so we can ship beta 2
[11:19:14] <gseguin> back
[11:19:23] <scottjehl> l
[11:19:25] <scottjehl> k
[11:19:28] <toddparker> i'd rather have less in it, but get it out sooner
[11:19:47] <scottjehl> yeah the other branch for dom cleanup is close to done too
[11:19:54] <scottjehl> needs a unit test or two I think
[11:19:57] <toddparker> so looks like it's have the new gradients, transitions (hopefully), dom size, preload
[11:20:26] <scottjehl> autoinit branch is a small change
[11:20:31] <scottjehl> maybe worth rolling in
[11:20:32] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/master...autoinit-option
[11:20:39] <scottjehl> it doesn't change any default behavior
[11:20:41] <toddparker> yeah, that too
[11:21:15] <toddparker> so that is the lis tof bigger changes for beta 2
[11:21:17] <scottjehl> pushstate will be post B2
[11:21:21] <scottjehl> decoupled widgets too
[11:21:30] <toddparker> there are lots of bugs we could try to get fixed too. see gseguin is closing some now
[11:21:39] <toddparker> yeah, both will be great tho
[11:21:55] <gseguin> the transitions branch will fix at least 3 bugs
[11:22:01] <gseguin> once it lands
[11:22:07] <scottjehl> we also deprecated the "responsive layout helper" classes in a4
[11:22:10] <toddparker> think we should probably get b2 out soon, then do a b3
[11:22:11] <scottjehl> they're still in
[11:22:28] <toddparker> when to pull that band aid out?
[11:22:53] <toddparker> i think when we pull it, would be cool to have that as an optional plugin
[11:22:56] <toddparker> if not a lot of work
[11:23:03] <scottjehl> dunno. at the very least, they'll be separate and decoupled
[11:23:04] <toddparker> it could be legacy = not supported
[11:23:16] <toddparker> yeah, that
[11:23:18] <scottjehl> so we can still offer them for those who have coded apps against them
[11:23:22] <toddparker> right
[11:23:51] <_nickel> late but here :(
[11:23:59] <toddparker> any questions we should review now?
[11:24:05] <toddparker> hey _nickel
[11:24:17] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[11:24:20] <_nickel> production issue and my daughter was after me :P
[11:24:34] <scottjehl> able to fill us in on unit test status?
[11:24:38] <_nickel> ah yes!
[11:24:49] <_nickel> that dialog failure still exists
[11:24:51] <_nickel> its a legit bug
[11:24:52] <scottjehl> also, i saw you landed the loadPage fix - nice :)
[11:25:17] <_nickel> clicking the close button uses the dialog close method and not the select close method
[11:25:26] <scottjehl> k
[11:25:37] <_nickel> I think the select.close is necessary for setting state
[11:25:54] <_nickel> and it obviously works when you select a value from the list
[11:25:59] <_nickel> which uses select.close
[11:26:22] <toddparker> gotcha
[11:26:24] <_nickel> and I got stalled in figuring out how to properly direct the callback
[11:26:28] <toddparker> a complex change
[11:26:38] <toddparker> ?
[11:26:49] <_nickel> not sure, I haven't figured out how to do it
[11:26:55] <_nickel> shouldn't be too crazy, but I dunno
[11:27:13] <toddparker> if you need to ping scott, he's on today
[11:27:22] <_nickel> cool I should actually have time to work on it
[11:27:27] <toddparker> great
[11:27:36] <_nickel> also!
[11:27:40] <_nickel> well
[11:27:42] <_nickel> actually I'll wait
[11:27:42] <toddparker> we need some of your testing help too.
[11:27:45] <_nickel> yah
[11:27:45] <toddparker> ?
[11:27:51] <_nickel> totally off topic stuff
[11:28:29] <_nickel> but yes
[11:28:36] <toddparker> cool
[11:28:41] <toddparker> glad you have you back
[11:28:42] <_nickel> I need to look at those branches that scott emaild me about
[11:28:50] <toddparker> yeah. he
[11:28:54] <_nickel> well in 10 days or so it'll be 40 a week
[11:28:55] <_nickel> lol
[11:29:04] <toddparker> he's trying to figure out how to test some that stuff
[11:29:11] <_nickel> though I'm hoping to herk Jorn out with qunit a bit too
[11:29:12] <toddparker> i know. that's great
[11:29:18] <_nickel> *help
[11:29:20] <_nickel> not herk
[11:29:23] <toddparker> just waiting for the end of the month when you and kin are back
[11:29:27] <_nickel> I don't even know what "herk" is
[11:29:31] <toddparker> but beta 2 will go out before that
[11:29:34] <_nickel> kk
[11:30:04] <_nickel> thats all from me, sorry I don't have more to report :(
[11:30:07] <_nickel> but!
[11:30:11] <_nickel> since I have you and Scott here
[11:30:12] <toddparker> yeees
[11:30:47] <_nickel> I wanted to ask how the WebOS tablet is
[11:30:50] <_nickel> and
[11:31:04] <toddparker> it's nice, rendering wise
[11:31:09] <_nickel> thats good
[11:31:13] <toddparker> a bit heavy but otherwise seems nice
[11:31:18] <toddparker> we jsut got in an hour ago
[11:31:24] <_nickel> I saw the tweet :D
[11:31:44] <scottjehl> yeah it's nice
[11:31:46] <scottjehl> heavy
[11:31:48] <scottjehl> but nice
[11:32:02] <_nickel> and I was going to ask for feedback on my jqcon talk submission but I guess there's no point since they are already submitted!
[11:32:02] <scottjehl> the samsung tab is much lighter than the others
[11:32:04] <_nickel> :D
[11:32:21] <_nickel> scottjehl: is that the one they handed out at google io a couple of months ago?
[11:32:30] <_nickel> *submissions
[11:32:38] <toddparker> think so galaxy tab 20.1
[11:32:41] <toddparker> 10.1
[11:32:48] <_nickel> yah
[11:33:03] <toddparker> that one is very thin and light
[11:33:11] <_nickel> yah it seemed pretty nice to me
[11:33:21] * _nickel has no interest in tablets for himself
[11:33:35] <toddparker> crazy how many tablets we have all of a sudden - 2 ipads, nook color, tab 10.1, 2 plybooks, touchpad
[11:33:38] <gseguin> we ordered one of those
[11:33:49] <toddparker> cool
[11:34:05] <gseguin> yeah regarding tablets, we're going to need that scrollview in master for tablet stories
[11:34:08] <toddparker> seems important to get some honeycomb coverage for the day when people actuall buy
[11:34:11] <toddparker> 'em
[11:34:16] <gseguin> I mean out of experiments
[11:34:38] <toddparker> that needs some updating by kin when he gets back. hasn't been touched in months
[11:34:51] <toddparker> that will always be an add-on
[11:35:06] <gseguin> oh really?
[11:35:08] <toddparker> we should start thinking about adding position_fixed for toolbars
[11:35:18] <scottjehl> I don't think that's gonna land in master. heavy and very hard to support and target properly. best reserved just for native ipad apps I think
[11:35:26] <toddparker> it's really heavy so not everyone would need it
[11:35:40] <scottjehl> I think we'd do better aiming for native features of ios5, and others
[11:35:49] <toddparker> when we have a download builder, it could be added in there
[11:36:01] <scottjehl> -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch
[11:36:06] <toddparker> we're at the point aht we need to modualrize our plugins and have a builder
[11:36:18] <toddparker> if you're building a mobile web site, scrolling isn't prolly needed
[11:36:33] <_nickel> hmm thats a good point
[11:36:53] <_nickel> I did always like the idea of leveraging the native scrolling where possible
[11:37:05] <gseguin> yeah absolutely
[11:37:08] <_nickel> credit to you guys for that pt of view
[11:37:12] <scottjehl> yeah. I've got a cross-browser plugin that lets you string pages together and pull them to navigate between real urls. It won't land in master but I can't wait to get it somewhere where we can support it as an option
[11:37:14] <toddparker> now that ios 5 supports overflow and i think BB6 or playbook anyway, we can start thinking about how to layer that in too
[11:37:41] <scottjehl> just another example I mean
[11:37:53] <toddparker> my opinion is that we should support native scrolling in master, and have a momentum scroller as an option
[11:38:04] <toddparker> that is best for apps that need to be nor enative
[11:38:16] <scottjehl> for phonegap apps
[11:38:25] <toddparker> but ther eis a lot of complexity in how to properly target those at the right platforms and work it into our code
[11:38:58] <toddparker> for example, if you have a overflow div with toolbars above and below, you need to script the dimensions
[11:39:15] <toddparker> if you just use position:fixed for toolbars, it's a lot simpler
[11:39:46] <toddparker> lots of stuff to consider, but we're getting much better support for native scrolling and fixed coming very soon
[11:39:53] <toddparker> what apple does, everyone needs to do
[11:40:11] <toddparker> when kin is back and 1.0 is out, this will all need to be a priority
[11:40:22] <toddparker> i agree it's important for tablets
[11:40:44] <toddparker> alright, is there anything else we need to review here or should we hop back into dev?
[11:41:00] * _nickel is satisfied
[11:41:08] <gseguin> nothing else here
[11:42:48] <toddparker> cool, thanks all. see you on -dev
