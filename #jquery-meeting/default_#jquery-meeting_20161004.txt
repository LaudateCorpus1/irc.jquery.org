[14:00:31] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:01:03] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:01:06] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, kristyjy, nashvail, arschmitz
[14:01:53] <kristyjy> hi
[14:02:58] <sfrisk> So it's been awhile since our last meeitng
[14:03:11] <sfrisk> since pretty much everyone got hit with all of the things
[14:03:12] <geekman-rohit> yes
[14:03:18] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:03:32] <nashvail> Hey
[14:03:33] <sfrisk> I know I promised to fix normalize, and I didn't get to that
[14:03:59] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk should I?
[14:04:04] <geekman-rohit> I have free time tomorrow
[14:04:09] <sfrisk> if you would like to
[14:04:18] <sumedhN> Hi
[14:04:22] <geekman-rohit> I'll fix it tomorrow then
[14:04:31] <sfrisk> hello!
[14:04:34] <geekman-rohit> hey sumedhN
[14:04:40] <sumedhN> Hi dude
[14:04:42] <sfrisk> okay, once that's fixed we should be good to finalize inputs
[14:05:07] <sfrisk> Nashvail - I know you were working on grids, any progress on that?
[14:06:12] <geekman-rohit> i think we should have a lot more discussions on grids
[14:06:26] <nashvail> Not much really. I wanted to discuss the upcoming grid module in CSS and if they could have any impact on our plans
[14:06:40] <sfrisk> grid module won't hit us any time soon
[14:06:44] <geekman-rohit> aye
[14:06:56] <sfrisk> no browser currently supports them, and we're looking at 3-4 years before browser implementation
[14:07:05] <sfrisk> HOPEFULLY, we'll hit v1 before then
[14:07:29] <sfrisk> I do think supporting a flexbox grid would be a good idea
[14:07:38] <nashvail> Of course ðŸ™‚
[14:07:51] <sfrisk> I know that bootstrap 4 will be having a flexbox grid option if you flip a switch
[14:08:11] <sfrisk> so having the option between a flexbox grid or a float based grid is important
[14:08:26] <sfrisk> maybe have a variable that can be set stating which version you're using
[14:08:58] <geekman-rohit> I think we should focus on merging most PRs before we start a grid PR
[14:09:11] <geekman-rohit> and keep grid discussion open till then
[14:09:25] <sfrisk> fair enough
[14:09:29] <sfrisk> get everything else solid first
[14:09:47] <geekman-rohit> grid is something that has to be done right
[14:09:56] <geekman-rohit> they cause a lot of pain later otherwise
[14:09:58] <sfrisk> I have a ticket I want to create of an idea that I got from css-conf regarding typography
[14:10:00] <sfrisk> yeah, I agree
[14:10:07] <nashvail> Yeah I think we should have a solid plan before writing any code for grids I initially felt kinda lost ðŸ˜…
[14:10:27] <geekman-rohit> nashvail agreed
[14:12:21] <sfrisk> Okay so we have tables, inputs, and fixing normalize as the current priority
[14:12:31] <geekman-rohit> so sarah has finally given up on attendees list
[14:12:41] <sfrisk> well no one would put their names in
[14:12:54] <geekman-rohit> :D
[14:12:59] <sfrisk> or people would put their names in, who would lurk the entire time and never say anything
[14:13:05] <sfrisk> so now we don't get nice things
[14:13:06] <geekman-rohit> guilty as charged
[14:13:51] <sumedhN> Hello everyone I found this project interesting,you are all doing good.....i am figuring out how can i help?Need some guidance from you guys
[14:14:56] <geekman-rohit> hey sumedhN, you can go through existing issues and PRs and participate in discussions for now
[14:15:09] <geekman-rohit> and see if you can take up some task to work on
[14:15:34] <sfrisk> things that are tagged "Phase One" are the priority right now
[14:15:38] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Phase+One%22
[14:15:42] <sumedhN> thanks a lot @geekman-rohit.I will surely follow you
[14:16:00] <sumedhN> :)
[14:16:20] <sfrisk> going through PRs and Issues and helping with code reviews / giving input on issues is helpful too
[14:16:38] <sumedhN> ya copied that! @sfrisk
[14:19:37] <sfrisk> I also think we should create a ticket for having multiple components together on a page, to see how things visually look with each other
[14:19:57] <sfrisk> inputs/buttons/typography/other phase one features
[14:20:03] <sfrisk> tables
[14:20:12] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk shouldnt we merge them before that?
[14:20:18] <sfrisk> we should do a merge first
[14:20:42] <sfrisk> but this is more of a "seeing them on separate pages makes it hard to figure out if everything meshes well together"
[14:20:50] <geekman-rohit> yes!
[14:20:57] <sfrisk> actually in general we need to revamp our demos
[14:21:15] <geekman-rohit> also the code. Once its merged we will start noticing how differently each components code is written
[14:22:06] <nashvail> I think we have an issue open about revamping demos
[14:23:59] <sfrisk> we do
[14:24:15] <sfrisk> but the more I look at stuff, I agree, geekman-rohit, we're not always the same
[14:24:26] <sfrisk> once table/input/normalize are merged
[14:24:52] <sfrisk> it would be nice if we did like a full out review of everything, take stock of where we are, what else is needed for phase one, what should get reworked, etc
[14:25:04] <sfrisk> I know there are some styling options for mobile we need for v1
[14:26:16] <sfrisk> there is a lot of things in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XanhwddQ-PM that I think we should probably take into account
[14:26:34] <sfrisk> that would help standardize our code and units of measurement
[14:28:49] <nashvail> Oh this is nice
[14:28:54] <kristyjy> yes we should definitely use that :)
[14:29:06] <kristyjy> sorry for quietness.. work stuff :/
[14:29:36] <sfrisk> Okay, so GOALS: Get Normalize done this week.  Tables and Input merged in within the next 2 weeks.
[14:29:45] <sfrisk> Then take stock of where we are. Weâ€™ve been working on this project slowly for 2 years, and we should really take the time to re-evaluate our code base so far, what is needed, what is not needed, what should be fixed, etc.
[14:29:56] <sfrisk> and what our actual overall goals are
[14:30:34] <kristyjy> yeah that makes sense. A lot changes in 2 years for sure
[14:32:15] * geekman-rohit is busy watching that css-conf video
[14:32:23] <kristyjy> lol
[14:32:29] <geekman-rohit> and btw
[14:32:44] <kristyjy> you should watch all of those talks they were very good :)
[14:32:47] * geekman-rohit is now unemployed, so you can throw random work at him and he will do it gladly
[14:33:22] <sfrisk> lol
[14:33:27] <sfrisk> okay, so normalize first
[14:33:29] <nashvail> ðŸ˜‚
[14:33:37] <sfrisk> then let's finish up table/inputs
[14:34:12] <sfrisk> then we're going to create the great "Who are we? What are we trying to do?" ticket, and go into discussion how what we want to do from here
[14:34:40] <sfrisk> hopefully get some community input
[14:35:48] <sfrisk> and on that note, I don't really have anything we can really cover today
[14:36:36] <sfrisk> does anyone else have anything?
[14:37:22] <sfrisk> okay, see everyone later on #css-chassis
