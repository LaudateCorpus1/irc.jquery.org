[07:18:54] <jzaefferer> but hey, changing the topic took me only 10 minutes of figuring out the right invocations...
[09:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's Wednesday. I've got the right day this week :-)
[09:01:05] <jzaefferer> yay
[09:01:26] <rworth> :D
[09:01:26] <gnarf> heh
[09:01:58] <jzaefferer> in case you didn't yet notice, we've migrated to a new spreadsheet, the old was was almost full: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArIM4UVbwE-3dFg1T0k4VlE1bF82Nm9tbW90cVNxN0E#gid=0
[09:02:10] <rworth> way to go us, nearly 4 years of weekly meetings
[09:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's nearly 3, but we can use broken math :-)
[09:02:55] <rworth> oh 3.5
[09:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, we are dealing with JavaScript.
[09:02:59] <rworth> yeah
[09:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> oh, is it really that high?
[09:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> That's close enough to 4.
[09:03:25] <rworth> first was 2008-10-22
[09:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> yay us
[09:03:49] <rworth> how far we've come :)
[09:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> ...and now on to the agenda...
[09:04:20] <rworth> danheberden: here?
[09:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: I'd like to discuss general infrastructure when you get a chance (not in this meeting)
[09:05:36] <rworth> awesome work scott_gonzalez landing accordion animation and autocomplete sync
[09:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO!
[09:05:46] <rworth> anything to discuss on those today?
[09:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. They're in master and all done.
[09:06:30] <rworth> who's on top of unit tests?
[09:06:57] <jzaefferer> doesn't look so bad: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/868/
[09:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox was going to try to figure out which tests were failing specifically for BrowserStack.
[09:07:06] <rworth> wow
[09:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> I helped kborchers with some menu tests.
[09:07:24] <kborchers> ?hi5 @ scott_gonzalez
[09:07:25] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, ⋰⁵⋱
[09:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> I guess next up is effects
[09:07:29] <gnarf> :/
[09:07:46] <rworth> and it looks like only slider and dialog are disabled atm? (other than interactions, which don't count)
[09:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> We haven't been able to track down the problem with effects yet.
[09:08:05] <danheberden> hey scott_gonzalez - sry, was afk for a little bit
[09:08:05] <gnarf> well one is focus related
[09:08:08] <rworth> speaking of, why are dialog and slider disabled?
[09:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yup. I believe dialog is only disabled because of one-off dimension tests.
[09:08:15] <jzaefferer> slider and dialog will probably stay that way until we get to the redesigns
[09:08:29] <jzaefferer> or not
[09:08:37] <gnarf> the ie6 lockup in animation scares me
[09:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is that reproducible locally?
[09:08:57] <rworth> danheberden: any update on a stage server for api.jqueryui.com ?
[09:08:59] <gnarf> i dunno yet
[09:09:08] <gnarf> i could try to repro tomorrow
[09:09:17] <danheberden> rworth been trying to get puppet working properly to deploy said server
[09:09:19] <gnarf> i'll take a look at effects tests this week
[09:09:32] <danheberden> it's been a pile of crap getting it to work properly
[09:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> worksforme in manual BrowserStack
[09:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Do you have time to talk later today?
[09:10:07] <gnarf> so the problem is in the testswarm environment somehow?
[09:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I guess so
[09:10:17] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez yeah, totes
[09:10:44] <gnarf> puppet certificates/hostnames and ssl issues are the hardest part of getting puppet running imo
[09:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's consistently finishing for me
[09:11:09] <danheberden> the good news, though, is that once i figure it out with the distro details that (mt) has
[09:11:20] <danheberden> future communications won't be so difficult
[09:11:28] <danheberden> and it will be much simpler to just install and go
[09:11:55] <rworth> and do we know/remember why slider is disabled?
[09:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Not sure, we can look into it
[09:12:24] <rworth> ok, I'm happy to help get that one straightened up, if I can
[09:13:33] <rworth> ok, build process
[09:13:49] <rworth> I started setting grunt up for globalize this morning, to get some experience with it
[09:14:09] <rworth> (also need to lint and test as there are a few PRs to review)
[09:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have buy-in from all teams to switch to grunt?
[09:14:28] <rworth> core is on board, per DaveMethvin and rwaldron
[09:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:14:37] <rworth> has it been discussed with mobile?
[09:14:48] <jzaefferer> QUnit has no build system yet, so grunt is interesting there as well
[09:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure. Let's make a note to talk to Todd about it.
[09:14:56] <rworth> ok
[09:15:05] <jzaefferer> even if it would only use the lint and qunit tasks (aka run with PhantomJS)
[09:15:23] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I'm going to be heading up the core switch to grunt
[09:15:23] <rworth> would be interesting to see how far this gets us toward download builder and themeroller, I'm thinking custom grunt tasks
[09:15:26] <rwaldron> but i want to be careful
[09:15:34] <rwaldron> i want to get ben to lock in a supported release
[09:15:42] <rworth> not to replace the work nodejitsu has done/is doing, but to incorporate
[09:16:11] <rwaldron> jzaefferer speaking of...
[09:16:31] <rwaldron> i've been doing neat shit with jsdom + canvas with grunt node unit tests
[09:16:32] <jzaefferer> rworth: I suspect that the builtin concat/min tasks are useless for us, but using the uglify helper could still make a custom helper pretty easy to create
[09:17:02] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: you mean nodeunit?
[09:17:11] <rwaldron> jzaefferer :P yes.
[09:17:17] <rwaldron> the space was a typo
[09:17:21] <rwaldron> anyway, I have to run, but I'm glad you guys are interested in using grunt :)
[09:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ne5YxQNJu_jpPLB3z8ockT7Hw569Np4wwkbSIN8Fw5A/edit
[09:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> We need a jquery-team mailing list to make sharing easier
[09:18:11] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:18:14] <rworth> scott_gonzalez danheberden is going to propose that this Fri
[09:18:22] <rworth> whether -code or -tech or something
[09:18:28] <jzaefferer> danheberden: jquery-team list? was planned anyway, wasn't it?
[09:18:39] <rworth> -team would suggest whole team, would be good to just have a -dev list
[09:18:39] <jzaefferer> why not just jquery-team?
[09:18:51] <rworth> because there are team members that have no interest in such things
[09:18:56] <rworth> entire sub-teams rather
[09:19:00] <danheberden> jzaefferer yeah, that's the topic i'd like to work through
[09:19:01] <rworth> such as infra and events
[09:19:11] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:20:06] <jzaefferer> still, having a shared team list has some advantages - its not likely to have a lot of traffic, doesn't has to be private
[09:20:19] <rworth> true
[09:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you want to lead the grunt migration for UI?
[09:25:53] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez am I shared on that?
[09:25:56] <rworth> I can take a look at that one next, after Globalize (which shouldn't take long)
[09:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: I set it to anyone with the link can edit.
[09:26:15] <rwaldron> great thanks
[09:27:36] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ok
[09:28:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah if you could, i don't know anything there
[09:28:17] <gnarf> grunt wise
[09:28:20] <jzaefferer> once we adopt that project for all the jQuery projects - should be ask Ben about moving it to the jquery organization?
[09:28:22] <gnarf> i never even heard of it
[09:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: rworth said he'll lead it up.
[09:28:46] <rworth> gnarf: I got it
[09:29:13] <gnarf> coo
[09:29:20] <danheberden> jzaefferer i can offer that being a small possibility
[09:29:26] <rworth> speaking of, should jquery org adopt node-browserstack and/or node-wordpress, given its (future) dependence on those?
[09:30:31] <danheberden> rworth as long as dev continues, it's ok as personal projects, ya?
[09:31:18] <danheberden> funny how the ui meeting sometimes ends up the 'all the rest of jquery's loose ends meeting'
[09:31:21] <danheberden> :D
[09:31:24] <rworth> haha
[09:31:35] <jzaefferer> there's still Tooltip
[09:31:40] <rworth> what's your take on when to adopt scott_gonzalez
[09:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm up for adoption?!?
[09:32:03] <rworth> yes
[09:32:26] <jzaefferer> anyone disagrees with this? http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip#cr1329683912 (2nd comment)
[09:32:37] <danheberden> i learned to never as scott_gonzalez to call me daddy last conference - so i'll be declining adoption
[09:32:42] <danheberden> ask
[09:32:55] <danheberden> ^ *
[09:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think things that aren't at our core can stay personal projects.
[09:33:14] <danheberden> i'm worried about the projects/plugins getting too disorganized
[09:33:22] <danheberden> when they are our own, we can put time or whatever
[09:34:52] <jzaefferer> so
[09:34:54] <jzaefferer> TOOLTIP
[09:34:55] <jzaefferer> anyone disagrees with this? http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip#cr1329683912 (2nd comment)
[09:35:16] <danheberden> we're solving the problems of the universe and jzaefferer is worried about TOOLTIP?! :p <3z
[09:35:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with that. I'd like to work on it though.
[09:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> As long as we've got it documented as a todo.
[09:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'll talk to DaveMethvin or timmywil about whether we can get a utility method in core.
[09:36:27] <rworth> speaking of what we can get in core, what was it we talked about in the mobile mtg?
[09:36:44] <jzaefferer> biggest issue I got there is finding out our value from a list of values
[09:37:13] <jzaefferer> its not like a class, but a unique value inside the list, of which we know only a prefix (or whatever)
[09:37:37] <timmywil> uhohs!
[09:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'll take a look at that before talking to core.
[09:37:41] <gnarf> ?
[09:38:07] <jzaefferer> okay, well, I'll move it down
[09:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: quick background: there are more attributes than class which contain lists.
[09:38:46] <jzaefferer> other then that, I've started with documentation for tooltip: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs/blob/master/jquery-ui/tooltip/tooltip.xml
[09:39:26] <rworth> jzaefferer: I'll get that up on my test server this week (while we're waiting for danheberden's puppeteering)
[09:39:37] <danheberden> IM A REAL BOY
[09:39:38] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:40:01] <rworth> also saw krisborchers did the same for menu
[09:40:13] <jzaefferer> yep
[09:40:19] <jzaefferer> reviewed that this morning
[09:40:25] <jzaefferer> still quite a few methods and events missing
[09:41:45] <jzaefferer> well, that's it for tooltip then
[09:41:53] <jzaefferer> danheberden, back to the UNIVERSE
[09:42:28] <rworth> I guess that's it?
[09:42:38] <danheberden> jzaefferer with all this server work, i'm in the multiverse
[09:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: anything else for tooltip?
[09:44:58] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:45:08] <jzaefferer> well
[09:45:15] <jzaefferer> I tested on touch devices
[09:45:21] <jzaefferer> the other comment on the wiki page
[09:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that sounded good.
[09:48:13] <jzaefferer> regarding "When we write the user documentation, we should make it very clear that the items and content options need to be in-sync." - is that good enough in the documentation?
[09:49:04] * scott_gonzalez is looking
[09:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> Might want to also add a note in the items option.
[09:53:05] <jzaefferer> okay, I'll do that
