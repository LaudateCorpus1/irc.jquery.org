[08:53:43] <rwaldron> oi oi pogo til  you puke
[08:54:47] <timmywil> who is JohnResi1 ?
[08:55:06] <addyosmani> It's John's evil twin
[08:55:42] <DaveMethvin> .
[08:55:50] <timmywil> JohnResi1: do you know John Resig? We haven't seen him in a while.
[08:56:07] <timmywil> hey dave
[08:56:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah where is that guy
[08:56:14] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[08:56:29] <DaveMethvin> looks like most of the 1.7.2 tix are either you or me
[08:57:21] <addyosmani> timmywil: it sounds like you need this http://addyosmani.com/whereisjohn/
[08:57:41] <addyosmani> :)
[08:57:44] <timmywil> hahaha
[08:59:11] <timmywil> i'm pretty much just concerned with docs#10870
[08:59:13] <bot-t> [#10870]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10870
[08:59:43] <timmywil> but I know the fix
[08:59:51] <timmywil> just have to put a test together
[09:00:41] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg, still dripping wet i suspect
[09:01:08] <DaveMethvin> put something on, we're in a meeting!
[09:01:19] <jaubourg> haha4
[09:01:24] <jaubourg> how about a tie ?
[09:01:33] <DaveMethvin> a very LONG tie
[09:01:35] <jaubourg> (no need to thank me for the mental image)
[09:02:17] <DaveMethvin> hokay, we have some people today!
[09:02:44] <DaveMethvin> so jaubourg, any tickets you want to tackle for 1.7.2?
[09:03:01] <jaubourg> yes, the Callbacks not in the right state one
[09:03:05] <jaubourg> let me find it
[09:03:51] <jaubourg> ?10952
[09:03:51] <bot-t> [#10952]  (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/10952
[09:03:53] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, you here?
[09:04:19] <DaveMethvin> ok jaubourg, just assign it to you and set the milestone
[09:05:17] <DaveMethvin> there was the ticket today about exceptions thrown from deferreds, but that's old news
[09:05:18] <jaubourg> ok
[09:05:37] <DaveMethvin> ?11207
[09:05:38] <bot-t> [#11207] jQuery.active is not decremented on completion of AJAX request if an exception occurs in any deferred.done/fail callbacks (pending bug) - http://jqbug.com/11207
[09:06:10] <jaubourg> well, catch your exceptions :P
[09:06:15] <DaveMethvin> did you ever see the dean edwards trick to run things without trapping errors?
[09:06:27] <DaveMethvin> basically fire a custom event
[09:06:32] <jaubourg> this goes hand in hand with having deferred resolved/rejected asynchronously
[09:06:44] <DaveMethvin> although dean's let you do it sync as well
[09:06:50] <jaubourg> orly?
[09:07:05] <DaveMethvin> http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2009/03/callbacks-vs-events/
[09:07:32] <DaveMethvin> i remember seeing it when it came out but just recently stumbled across it again
[09:07:53] <DaveMethvin> just dunno if it's solid enough and what effect it might have on perf
[09:07:53] <jaubourg> are you sure about the sync stuff?
[09:08:06] <DaveMethvin> i think it's sync, you trigger the event sync
[09:08:22] <DaveMethvin> but you're using the browser's event plumbing
[09:08:58] <jaubourg> well, we can test that inside the $.Callbacks fire function
[09:09:10] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:09:18] <DaveMethvin> who knows maybe its an undiscovered gem
[09:09:25] <DaveMethvin> or, re-discovered i guess
[09:09:30] <jaubourg> though it may complexify it quite a lot... and I see nothing about sync in what I read :P
[09:09:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> i don't think any framework ever adopted it
[09:09:52] <DaveMethvin> so that may be a bad sign
[09:09:59] <DaveMethvin> but only a test will tell
[09:10:20] <DaveMethvin> so can we have a 1.7.2 beta ready by next Monday?
[09:10:42] <jaubourg> seeing how pathetically small my pile is, I'll say YES!
[09:10:44] * jaubourg hides
[09:10:47] <DaveMethvin> mainly that's me, jaubourg, timmywil
[09:11:13] <DaveMethvin> i have a bunch of stuff, but i think i can get it done this week
[09:11:36] <timmywil> I can do that
[09:12:03] <DaveMethvin> cool, so beta next monday and maybe let it stew for a week before release
[09:12:12] <DaveMethvin> we can do an rc if needed
[09:12:19] <jaubourg> ok
[09:13:00] <DaveMethvin> ok, so 1.8 then ... oh screw it let's make 1.7.2 the last release :D
[09:13:39] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> as far as releases go i've been thinking about what ppl really want
[09:13:48] <DaveMethvin> we
[09:14:00] <DaveMethvin> have a lot of ppl who just want bug fixes
[09:14:18] <jaubourg> true
[09:14:23] <DaveMethvin> and tehn we have the vocal minority who want smaller stuff and no ie6/7/8 support,  maybe some mobile support
[09:15:11] <DaveMethvin> i am wondering if we should start on jquery2.0 in parallel and do 1.8 more as a maint release
[09:15:24] <DaveMethvin> so 2.0 can break stuff
[09:15:28] <DaveMethvin> and leave stuff out
[09:15:59] <DaveMethvin> we've kind of implied we're ripping off the band-aid a little bit at a time on each release
[09:16:08] <jaubourg> if we go the 2.0 route, then we'll have to maintain the 1.x branch
[09:16:09] <timmywil> so this hasn't been answered for me yet: did john change his mind? I thought there wasn't going to be a 2.0
[09:16:39] <DaveMethvin> we can ask him, it might be good to do this discussion on the jquery-bugs-team list to get more input
[09:16:57] <timmywil> good idea
[09:17:03] <jaubourg> +1
[09:17:15] <DaveMethvin> if we are not going to really cut out anything, and we aren't going to add anything because of size, then we have reached the end of the line?
[09:17:24] <DaveMethvin> that's why i think 2.0 would be good
[09:17:37] <jaubourg> yeah, I came to the same conclusion
[09:17:43] <DaveMethvin> we can rethink what we want to do, but still let ppl use the 1.x version for compat
[09:17:59] <DaveMethvin> and we can have a compat  plugin if needed for 2.0 but that's not its mission
[09:18:36] <jaubourg> $ = $.older();
[09:18:38] <DaveMethvin> so maybe 2.0 cuts out ie 6/7/8 support but has a plugin to add it back
[09:18:58] <timmywil> eek, I don't think that should happen
[09:19:22] <DaveMethvin> it depnds on how long 1.x will be supported
[09:19:27] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: what are you considering the latest IE baseline?
[09:19:39] <jaubourg> IE10?
[09:19:41] <addyosmani> I would have thought keeping 8 support in would have made sense. Kill 6/7
[09:19:45] <DaveMethvin> well the latest released version  is ie9
[09:19:55] <jaubourg> weren't they supposed to force updates now?
[09:20:16] <DaveMethvin> if we keep ie8 then we can't get rid of most of the ie quirks
[09:20:19] <jaubourg> keep in mind, before we have a releasable 2.0, browser's landscape will have changed
[09:20:20] <DaveMethvin> including all the event problems
[09:20:28] <addyosmani> that is true jaubourg
[09:20:45] <addyosmani> I guess DaveMethvin is right. Depends on how long 1.x is going to be supported for
[09:21:18] <DaveMethvin> i'd rather start 2.0 small and build up than be timid about trimming down and need to cut it later, causing new compat issues
[09:21:50] <jaubourg> we should have 2.0 not having ajax nor animation at first
[09:21:53] <jaubourg> see how it fares
[09:21:54] <mikesherov> HERE
[09:21:55] <bot-t> (4 hours 40 mins ago) <addyosmani> tell mikesherov I need to catchup with the front-end team about what the plan is for moving across/updating docs.jquery.com. Will ping once I know more.
[09:22:01] <DaveMethvin> like, if you know  you have css transitions can you get by without animations?
[09:22:04] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[09:22:14] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/664/files
[09:22:15] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1m, 29s ago): too many undefs.
[09:22:31] <addyosmani> mikesherov: on that bot-t msg, I'll ping you later about progress.
[09:22:55] <DaveMethvin> so anyway, my point on a 2.0 is that we have the ability to rethink the layering and dependencies
[09:23:27] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:23:33] <DaveMethvin> we shouldn't go too wild on breaking things, for example i would be worried about changing semantics on apis that we keep
[09:23:46] <jaubourg> didn't advance much on the tracing thingy btw :(
[09:23:58] <jaubourg> clients + gf = notimeforlovedoctorjones
[09:24:16] <DaveMethvin> and if you look at projects where they've broken compat a lot, like perl 5 to perl 6, ppl are just ignoring the new stuff
[09:24:30] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think that will happen with 2.0 if we do it right
[09:24:52] <jaubourg> well, what we should do is not break stuff we keep, re-think stuff we dislike
[09:24:54] <timmywil> according to w3counter.com 12/11, ie8 still has the largest market share of the browsers.  ie7 is close to ie9. Without dropping ie8, dropping ie6/7 won't give us a lot.  I think it will still be a long while before we should drop those.
[09:24:54] <DaveMethvin> we need higher prio than gf, jaubourg!!
[09:25:03] <jaubourg> I know I know :/
[09:25:43] <DaveMethvin> timmywil i think we can have an answer for that, jQuery 1.8 and whatever, but still address the future with 2.0
[09:26:17] <DaveMethvin> so 1.x would be stable except for bug fixes basically
[09:26:31] <DaveMethvin> and ppl wouldn't be complaining we changed things every release
[09:26:47] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: my point is that the future will not be without ie8, and possibly not without ie7, for a while. we don't want to make 2.0 unusable.
[09:27:05] <DaveMethvin> it could be usable with an ie6/7/8 plugin for example
[09:27:26] <DaveMethvin> or targeted to a non-ie situation, since we  have 1.x for those needs
[09:27:41] <timmywil> I think from our experience, we've seen that people don't want to use plugins.
[09:27:42] <DaveMethvin> we don't need to maintain two versions that address the same audience
[09:27:53] <DaveMethvin> agreed on plugins, timmywil
[09:28:10] <DaveMethvin> but the only solution to that is to include everything
[09:28:15] <DaveMethvin> that is what got us to this point
[09:28:28] <DaveMethvin> if we can't remove anything, where do we go?
[09:28:35] <timmywil> I think supporting all of the browsers with less features and greatly reduced size is still a good idea
[09:28:44] <DaveMethvin> but what less features?
[09:28:57] <timmywil> all of the stuff that we don't like
[09:29:02] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:29:19] <DaveMethvin> kind of reminds me of the talks about cutting government :D
[09:29:23] <jaubourg> I, for one, would love a fresh start on ajax and anim
[09:29:41] <jaubourg> and 2.0 would be the gate for that
[09:30:20] <jaubourg> I'm not that concerned about the exact compatibility list
[09:30:29] <DaveMethvin> so the tightrope we would be walking would be to make 2.0 close enough to 1.x that it isn't a rewrite for most ppl, but i think we can figure that out
[09:30:56] <DaveMethvin> and if we keep 1.x around in its current form with no additional deletions there won't be cries about breakage each new release
[09:31:54] <DaveMethvin> but how about i start a thread on the group about this, and we can include the deadbeats who aren't here :P
[09:32:00] <timmywil> i gots to run. I'll keep an eye out for a thread
[09:32:17] <timmywil> ttys
[09:32:23] <DaveMethvin> cyl
[09:32:35] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, google docs isnt working
[09:32:45] <DaveMethvin> ah back
[09:32:48] <jaubourg> +1 for the thread
[09:32:54] <jaubourg> I'll have to fly shortly too :/
[09:33:42] <DaveMethvin> ok, let's call it a meeting then, i'll start that thread and ppl can chime in
[09:33:47] <DaveMethvin> thanks everyone!
[13:14:48] <JohnResi1> what's this I hear about 2.0 not having IE 6-8 support?
[13:14:58] <JohnResi1> err
