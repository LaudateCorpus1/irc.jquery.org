[14:00:47] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:00:57] <sumedhN> Hello sfrisk
[14:01:01] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, nashvail, kristyjy
[14:01:04] <sfrisk> hello
[14:02:24] <sumedhN> I opened a pull request last week including the irc logs in contributing.md.what's your opinion on that? @sfrisk
[14:02:32] <sfrisk> Looking at it now
[14:02:55] <sfrisk> I was away all last week in a non wifi/cell area so I've been reviewing what I missed.
[14:04:25] <sfrisk> I've added a comment
[14:05:07] <arschmitz> hi
[14:05:47] <sfrisk> Okay, so geekman-rohit is away this week, but he did pull in the fixes for normalize
[14:06:14] <sfrisk> so @kristyjy - I think your work was fine, can you just rebase your changes to include normalize
[14:06:19] <sfrisk> make sure visually everything plays nice
[14:06:38] <kristyjy> sure
[14:07:05] <sfrisk> same with the input PR, but I don't think nashvail is here
[14:09:05] <sfrisk> I still need to create the 2 issues I mentioned last meeting
[14:11:12] <sfrisk> sumedhN, if you make the change I mentioned, I think your PR should be good
[14:11:19] <sfrisk> If anyone else wants to review it: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/171
[14:12:39] <sumedhN> @sfrisk which changes?
[14:13:38] <sfrisk> ah, sorry, github changed the steps needed to be taken to send a comment on a line item. it should appear now
[14:14:05] <sumedhN> yes it has appeared
[14:15:48] <sfrisk> kristyjy/arschmitz - it's a pretty straightforward PR, but feel free to add a comment if you notice wording or anything
[14:16:06] <kristyjy> sounds good I'll take a peek at it
[14:18:59] <sfrisk> okay, minus those notes, and writing tickets, I don't have anything else for today. I'll get the discussion up on  typography revamp and unit measurement revamp
[14:19:08] <sfrisk> anyone have anything else
[14:23:04] <sumedhN> I made some changes to contributing.md @sfrisk
[14:29:22] <kristyjy> other than agreeing with @sfrisk's feedback I have no other suggestions @sumedhN
[14:30:45] <sumedhN> okay
[14:32:26] <nashvail> Guys?
