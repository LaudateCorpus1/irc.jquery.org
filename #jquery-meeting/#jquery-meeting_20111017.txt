[09:03:19] <gnarf> hey guys
[09:05:24] <timmywil> hi!
[09:05:46] <timmywil> where the peeps at
[09:06:10] <rwaldron> here!
[09:07:05] <rwaldron> jaubourg how come i didnt see you when i came back in here from the meeting i was in?
[09:07:09] <rwaldron> <3333333333
[09:07:21] <jaubourg> dunno, blindness?
[09:07:23] * gnarf hugs jaubourg
[09:07:27] * rwaldron just waved at jaubourg from across the room
[09:07:28] <timmywil> jaubourg: you're still in boston??
[09:07:31] <jaubourg> yep
[09:07:36] <timmywil> -_-
[09:07:37] <jaubourg> @bocoup right now
[09:07:40] <gnarf> lucky bastard
[09:08:07] <jaubourg> is there a meeting going on btw?
[09:08:16] <timmywil> docs#10501 new blocker
[09:08:17] <bot-t> [#10501]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10501
[09:08:35] <gnarf> apparently
[09:08:57] <timmywil> just a couple things
[09:09:42] <jaubourg> man, I wish I had followed the html5 shiv thingy... I'll probably need to ask rick for a crash course
[09:10:14] <gnarf> hrm
[09:10:29] <gnarf> that shiv method of using outerhtml instead of cloning
[09:10:48] <gnarf> thats gonna cause other problems right?
[09:11:02] <timmywil> won't that only help in like one browser?
[09:11:33] <rwaldron> I worked on that in an airport in minneapolis
[09:12:15] <rwaldron> the annoying part: he references Jonathan Neal's shimprove
[09:12:40] <rwaldron> Jonathan is the one that did all the research for jQuery
[09:12:54] <rwaldron> I just implemented his work and had him check my commits
[09:13:35] <gnarf> well i mean, we can go a step further and use the outerHTML + shim instead of cloneNode
[09:13:45] <rwaldron> :(
[09:13:46] <gnarf> but is that going to break anything else?
[09:13:51] <timmywil> can we?
[09:14:04] <gnarf> timmywil: i don't see why we cant
[09:14:08] <timmywil> outerHTML isn't supported
[09:14:20] <rwaldron> see my :( above
[09:14:31] <gnarf> timmywil: but its supported in the only browser having problems with this
[09:14:35] <gnarf> right?
[09:14:42] <rwaldron> only browser?
[09:14:46] <rwaldron> 6,7,8
[09:15:01] <rwaldron> is it supported in all of those?
[09:15:13] <timmywil> ok, i didn't think it was.  looks like it is
[09:15:26] <rwaldron> well, that's good news
[09:15:42] <gnarf> i think IE5 had that shit
[09:16:12] <timmywil> it's a little hard to look at
[09:16:23] <timmywil> gnarf: yea, as of ie5 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534310(v=vs.85).aspx
[09:16:46] <rwaldron> forgive me
[09:17:00] <rwaldron> i've rarely used outerHTML
[09:17:05] <timmywil> i just remembered we never wanted to use outerHTML because of lack of support, but it wasn't IE that didn't have support!
[09:17:14] <timmywil> wat
[09:17:15] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[09:17:16] <timmywil> anyway
[09:17:23] <gnarf> its an IE creation
[09:17:53] <timmywil> go microsoft
[09:17:55] <gnarf> you should listen to jonathan's ie6 song
[09:17:59] <gnarf> and then solve this bug
[09:18:08] <rwaldron> So anyway, maybe I'll try this outerHTML method first
[09:18:34] <rwaldron> so far I've only written a test, using his jsbin code
[09:19:52] <timmywil> now, it will certainly not work in ff2, but i guess we're ok with that
[09:20:46] <gnarf> there was a 2
[09:20:47] <gnarf> ?
[09:21:08] <timmywil> the other blocker is dave's, but he's said it's most likely a change to the mousewheel plugin
[09:21:22] <gnarf> yeah
[09:21:32] <gnarf> and it didn't seem hard
[09:21:39] <timmywil> so we maybe we can set a tentative date for rc1
[09:21:47] <gnarf> he was leaving it open cuz he was gonna make a pull against the plugin
[09:21:53] <timmywil> yup
[09:22:56] <timmywil> does next monday work?
[09:23:26] <timmywil> really up to rwaldron, which I can spend time on that as well if needed
[09:23:50] <gnarf> timmywil: any chance to work on a test for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/543 ?
[09:23:51] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gnarf37 (5d, 20h ago): Adding step functions for scrollTop/scrollLeft - Fixes #9217
[09:24:07] <rwaldron> timmywil gnarf testing help will be appreciated
[09:24:10] <gnarf> also, i think that we should probably make the width/height defined like mine
[09:24:16] <timmywil> gnarf: oh sry, i haven't had a chance.  I can work on that this week too
[09:24:17] <rwaldron> i'll have a starting point soon
[09:25:03] <gnarf> timmywil: it doesn't need to use the each, we can totaly have a closure named func, jQuery.fx.step.width = stepWidthHeight
[09:25:21] <gnarf> might be able to unfold that extend too
[09:25:51] <timmywil> gnarf: whatever's shorter really
[09:26:16] <gnarf> timmywil: well, unfolding helps with the execution time / static analysis right?
[09:26:25] <gnarf> i'll weigh them both
[09:26:29] <gnarf> and report in later
[09:27:23] <timmywil> gnarf: we already each and extend quite a bit, but i think unfolding will be shorter anyway
[09:27:35] <gnarf> timmywil: agreed
[09:28:35] <timmywil> ok, i said shooting for 10/24 rc1 release
[09:28:50] <timmywil> that should be it
[09:29:07] <gnarf> any other topics?
[09:29:19] <gnarf> jaubourg: any report on status?
[09:29:24] <gnarf> :)
[09:29:24] <timmywil> push for people to test beta2
[09:29:43] <jaubourg> I don't have much to report except weather is strangely nice in Boston
[09:29:56] <timmywil> sob
[09:30:01] <timmywil> ;)
[09:30:04] <jaubourg> :P
[09:30:27] <timmywil> ok thanks all!
[09:32:33] <gnarf> see you in -dev
