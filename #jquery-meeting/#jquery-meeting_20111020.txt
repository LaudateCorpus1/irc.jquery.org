[11:01:38] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:01:46] <toddparker> the jQuery Meeting is about to start
[11:01:49] <toddparker> chime in
[11:02:25] <johnbender> hallo
[11:02:31] <eddiemonge> im not here at the moment but leave a message
[11:02:49] <Wilto> Yo.
[11:02:56] <kinblas> here
[11:06:06] <toddparker> ok so first item
[11:06:09] <toddparker> ThemeRoller
[11:06:17] <toddparker> we now have access to staging
[11:06:38] <toddparker> we need to figure out paths to be relative so they work on live or test
[11:06:52] <toddparker> generate_url.php
[11:06:56] <toddparker> $url = 'http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller-test/index.php?style_id=' . $new_file_id;
[11:08:08] <toddparker> share theme
[11:08:25] <kinblas> toddparker: we can just change that to location.href
[11:08:26] <kinblas> or something
[11:11:11] <eddiemonge> $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]
[11:13:40] <kinblas> eddiemonge: thanks I know now you guys were talking about the php part
[11:13:41] <kinblas> :-)
[11:17:58] <toddparker> we need a way to deal with versions of this
[11:19:29] <eddiemonge> jqui looks like it just uses lastest stable
[11:22:40] <eddiemonge> themeroller needs:
[11:22:46] <eddiemonge> 1. relative paths in code
[11:22:54] <eddiemonge> 2. versioning issues and how to handle them
[11:23:02] <eddiemonge> 3. api keys for things like kuler
[11:28:07] <eddiemonge> 4. theme names (filename change, include in the script)
[11:28:57] <toddparker> perfect recap eddie - kinblas is going to look at this
[11:29:09] <toddparker> last feature: custom name for themes @ downlaod
[11:29:22] <toddparker> ok, on to some issues
[11:29:41] <toddparker> Version change Beta3 to RC1 has broken a configuration option?
[11:29:42] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2725
[11:29:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2725 on jquery-mobile, reported by jeroenvandijk (3d, 5h ago): Version change Beta3 to RC1 has broken a configuration option?
[11:30:31] <toddparker> problem: he's expecting ajax enabled will shut off off link hijacking
[11:30:46] <toddparker> but we still handle links for internal links (multi-page)
[11:31:10] <toddparker> proposal: config option to turn off link handling completely
[11:34:21] <toddparker> Our proposal: config option to turn off link handling completely, place inside the click handler logic. Need a name:  $.mobile.defaultClickHandlingEnabled. @johnbender will look at adding for next release.
[11:34:47] <toddparker> we can discuss naming

[11:40:42] <toddparker> we need to do some testing
[11:40:49] <toddparker> take list perf page
[11:41:03] <toddparker> 1. paste in post-enhanced markup and test
[11:41:29] <toddparker> (that won't have the mouse events, eliminates jQM)
