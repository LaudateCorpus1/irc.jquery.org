[11:01:34] <gnarf> Infrastructure Team - Assemble?
[11:01:36] <gnarf> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUfGj8dQH3Q4JoBOlNnfDFrESzMt6LhktXsmtPYocXI/edit
[11:02:12] <danheberden> delete all of the things!
[11:02:17] <danheberden> no moar servers!
[11:02:29] <clarkbox> i will
[11:02:31] <gnarf> HAPPY HALLOWEEN
[11:02:36] <gnarf> first order of business apparent
[11:02:48] <gnarf> anyone have an awesome costume? :)
[11:02:50] <danheberden> look, i'm dressed up as a bash script
[11:03:02] <gnarf> hash bang bro
[11:03:57] <gnarf> so clarkbox - apparently someone did maintenence while we were still using the machine because they didn't know we were still using it
[11:04:02] <gnarf> according to the (mt) guys
[11:04:06] <clarkbox> ok np
[11:04:10] <gnarf> they could try to restore it, or we can build a new one
[11:04:16] <clarkbox> easy to build new
[11:04:24] <clarkbox> i have backup!
[11:04:25] <gnarf> agree
[11:04:53] <gnarf> I'll email him and ask if we were going to be getting our own at some point to work on or if we should rebuild it on that test machine
[11:05:02] <clarkbox> ok sounds good
[11:06:38] <gnarf> So, I kinda wanted to just have everyone take a look at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues?state=open
[11:07:52] <gnarf> is there anything assigned to you that you need to punt, or is there anything unassigned that you want to assign to yourself for ownership, please do
[11:09:07] <gnarf> I'm going to try to tackle the ones assigned to me this week
[11:09:16] <clarkbox> ill have a look through there today and clean up/assign anything i am responsible for
[11:09:41] <gnarf> thanks
[11:09:52] <clarkbox> some of the splunk issues are "long term" tasks
[11:09:54] <gnarf> Mergeatron / IRC / email notification strategies - mikesherov yt?
[11:10:07] <mikesherov> here
[11:10:25] <mikesherov> so, still banging away on mergeatron sqllite implementation
[11:10:33] <mikesherov> Sorry for the delay
[11:10:34] <clarkbox> once splunk is up and running, i can finish this task pretty quick https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/107
[11:10:47] <gnarf> mikesherov: cool, got an ETA for when we should start worrying about setting it up?
[11:11:25] <mikesherov> My priority list is as follows: 1. clean up UI unit test suite (EOD today), 2. triage remaining new "UI tixx" (3 days left), 3. mergeatron (5-6 hours of work over 2 days or so)
[11:11:40] <mikesherov> so, by mid of next week, depending on free time, I should be ready
[11:11:46] <gnarf> and clarkbox - do you think that splunk could also e-mail the output from the notifier scripts? they get sent to syslog
[11:11:51] <gnarf> mikesherov: seems good
[11:12:04] <clarkbox> ya should be doable
[11:12:39] <clarkbox> gnarf, can you detail that requirement in that ticket?
[11:12:47] <gnarf> Sure
[11:12:57] <danheberden> gnarf, did we ever hear more about https?
[11:13:02] <gnarf> clarkbox: how about IRC notifications, can splunk do that too?
[11:13:07] <danheberden> you had said chris talked to you about it?
[11:13:27] <gnarf> danheberden: I haven't heard anything more, do you want to do the followup there, or should I
[11:13:34] <gnarf> also, maybe we should invite chris to our meeting?
[11:13:46] <clarkbox> yes, i have had that working at one point
[11:13:48] <danheberden> we could try - he seems rather preoccupied
[11:13:53] <danheberden> but yeah, i can try to see whats up
[11:14:02] <danheberden> been trying to get a hold of lily for other stuff for like a month now
[11:14:03] <danheberden> :/
[11:14:45] <gnarf> Well maybe if chris can't make it, there might be another (mt) rep who could?
[11:16:40] <gnarf> it might be nice to have an (mt) insider around for these.
[11:16:49] <gnarf> danheberden: do you want to handle that?
[11:17:08] <gnarf> the followup with chris
[11:17:10] <gnarf> that or I can
[11:18:05] <ryanneufeld> back
[11:19:26] <gnarf> this "Inconsistencies between stage and live" - jzaefferer noticed the other day that something worked on stage and didn't on live
[11:19:46] <gnarf> I'm not really sure what happened, or why, because the versions of the configs were identical
[11:20:03] <gnarf> but there are some places were it seems our stage isn't doing a good enough job of duplicating live environment
[11:20:05] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I can take on #78
[11:20:15] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/78
[11:20:19] <danheberden> gnarf, i'll handle it
[11:20:30] <danheberden> i have some other (mt) going on
[11:20:31] <danheberden> with work
[11:20:36] <gnarf> ryanneufeld and danheberden - sounds good
[11:21:46] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: what's the status of https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/69
[11:22:03] <gnarf> i was gonna ask you, yer assigned :)
[11:22:23] <gnarf> it would still be nice to rsync that script around and get it running in zabbix
[11:22:31] <ryanneufeld> can puppet it
[11:22:38] <gnarf> er i meant puppet
[11:22:43] <gnarf> but rsync was in my head
[11:23:15] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'll need your help with finding the right place to put it in the manifests
[11:23:34] <ryanneufeld> at least I did, I know a bit more about puppet in general now, so I'll take another whack at it
[11:23:47] <gnarf> seems fine, we can talk over implementation specifics in -infrastructure later
[11:24:11] <ryanneufeld> yup
[11:24:56] <gnarf> also, we need to go around and upgrade the packages on all the servers
[11:25:10] <ryanneufeld> I can help with that
[11:25:20] <gnarf> there are new versions of puppet & pretty much most of the tools we are using
[11:25:31] <ryanneufeld> mhmm
[11:25:48] <gnarf> would be nice to upgrade stage to 3.0 and make sure everything still seems to be running smoothish --- but you'll need to upgrade citadel first
[11:26:03] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: want to make yourself an issue to handle it?
[11:26:14] <ryanneufeld> Sure
[11:26:22] <ryanneufeld> I just went through that process on our new production server
[11:26:28] <ryanneufeld> so I think I can figure it out
[11:26:32] <ryanneufeld> should be straight forward though
[11:26:33] <gnarf> yeah
[11:26:35] <gnarf> its pretty simple
[11:26:42] <gnarf> just make sure someone else is around in case something blows up
[11:26:43] <gnarf> :)
[11:27:00] <gnarf> i'd rather have 2 minds on a "OMFG" problem than one
[11:27:00] <ryanneufeld> that would be gnarf or danheberden?
[11:27:04] <gnarf> prolly me
[11:27:07] <ryanneufeld> k
[11:27:27] <gnarf> Documentation - puppet stuffs
[11:27:47] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: ps. you can follow along on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUfGj8dQH3Q4JoBOlNnfDFrESzMt6LhktXsmtPYocXI/edit ;)
[11:28:14] <ryanneufeld> k
[11:28:14] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/119
[11:28:24] <ryanneufeld> new issue for updating prod boxen
[11:30:01] <gnarf> so, RE documentation
[11:30:08] <gnarf> not sure who added this one
[11:30:22] <gnarf> did anyone have anything to say about it?
[11:31:01] <ryanneufeld> There is a README.md in the root
[11:31:43] <ryanneufeld> Though that's more for vagrant. I'm not sure what *we* could document about puppet though.
[11:31:46] <gnarf> we might want to write up our own "what is puppet" and "how/why do i use it" type of docs for some of the other JS people in our wider team community
[11:31:55] <gnarf> well, there is a good example in the agenda
[11:32:06] <gnarf> aka “Updating TestSwarm’s browserSet json file should not require a puppet change --gnarf”
[11:32:11] <gnarf> I assume Krinkle|detached added this?
[11:32:29] <Krinkle> gnarf: on your behalf, yes.
[11:33:15] <gnarf> but its the kind of thing to maybe have a few Yes and No examples of "what is configuration managment responsible for"
[11:33:39] <ryanneufeld> Does X go in puppet? Yes/No
[11:33:43] <ryanneufeld> sort of thing?
[11:33:45] <gnarf> yeah
[11:33:49] <ryanneufeld> if No, why?
[11:34:21] <ryanneufeld> My thinking here though is that, puppet is a systems thing. How often will the js peeps be working with it?
[11:34:59] <gnarf> hopefully less often, but it might be nice to have an overview to give some of them. for instance gseguin needs to touch puppet now and then to add a new release to the jquery mobile download builder
[11:35:21] <gnarf> at some point, I would hope that this could be done by releasing a new "version" of the download builder and having it deploy/setup itself
[11:35:33] <gnarf> but for now, shortest path to getting shit working
[11:35:52] <ryanneufeld> Then maybe a doc explaining how to accomplish a specific task
[11:35:59] <ryanneufeld> without getting too deep into what puppet is
[11:36:42] <ryanneufeld> using your example, it would be smallish change to single file. Analogous to editing a config?
[11:37:37] <gnarf> perhaps - I really don't mind punting most puppet changes down to you or me tho
[11:37:49] <gnarf> clarkbox's starting to get it too
[11:38:21] <ryanneufeld> I'd prefer it that way
[11:38:39] <gnarf> If someone out in the team at large is interested in learning how to put shit in puppet themselves, they can just join -infra and ask for help
[11:38:44] <ryanneufeld> for the most part people are looking to accomplish a specific task
[11:39:01] <ryanneufeld> and they can contact gnarf or ryanneufeld for help
[11:39:07] <gnarf> right
[11:39:10] <gnarf> seems sane
[11:39:29] <ryanneufeld> Maybe we could update the docs around the arch
[11:39:47] <ryanneufeld> some kind of a network diagram? or explanation of how the staging env works?
[11:40:00] <gnarf> we do need to up the quality of our wiki pages a bit
[11:40:03] <ryanneufeld> I'm still a little foggy on that one, and I've read most of the wiki
[11:40:08] <gnarf> make em more useful
[11:40:43] <gnarf> any other business from anyone?
[11:41:39] <gnarf> danheberden: did you see https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/DNS-AXFR ?
[11:43:41] <danheberden> no
[11:43:55] <danheberden> but nice!
[11:45:40] <gnarf> danheberden: i know you were looking for something like that and for us to take that list and update something
[11:45:58] <gnarf> for instance, I see a bunch of dns entries in there for the old proxy-.... servers etc that could prolly be killed now
[11:46:04] <gnarf> since those machines aren't even running
[11:47:08] <gnarf> oh, one last order of business
[11:47:25] <gnarf> I want to email our table attendees about continuing contribution
[11:47:34] <gnarf> invite them to join us at the next meeting
[11:48:09] <gnarf> if there is nothing else?
[11:48:38] <gnarf> see you in -infrastructure
