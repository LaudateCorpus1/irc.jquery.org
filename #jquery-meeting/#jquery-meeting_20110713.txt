[09:09:57] <jzaefferer> anyone around for the jQuery UI meeting?
[09:10:03] <kborchers> here
[09:10:15] <jzaefferer> looks like Dan, Scott and Richard won't make it
[09:10:16] <toddparker> here
[09:10:22] <toddparker> hmm
[09:10:31] <jzaefferer> hey Todd, kborchers
[09:10:40] <toddparker> jzaeffer, you're in toronto, right?
[09:10:54] <toddparker> jzaefferer, that is
[09:11:08] <jzaefferer> yep, leaving Friday night
[09:11:24] <jzaefferer> hey ajpiano, any news on recruiting people for infrastructure?
[09:12:27] <ajpiano> oof , not yet
[09:13:01] <jzaefferer> otherwise, while there were some small updates for jquery-docs (its now a jquery repo), I don't think we've got any substantial progress there
[09:13:18] <jzaefferer> right now the biggest issue to tackle is search
[09:13:32] <jzaefferer> if everything is just static html files, how can we index and search them
[09:13:53] <jzaefferer> which also affects other sites with static content, e.g. the new learn(ing) site, probably qunitjs.com
[09:13:55] <toddparker> yeah
[09:13:59] <toddparker> we have the same issue on mobile
[09:14:10] <toddparker> so docs are in git? that's cool
[09:14:14] <jzaefferer> as in, no search for the mobile docs?
[09:14:29] <toddparker> yeah
[09:14:45] <jzaefferer> well, what started on my account and got forked by Scott is now on /jquery: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs
[09:14:58] <toddparker> nice
[09:15:02] <jzaefferer> other then that its still just work in progress
[09:15:34] <jzaefferer> Adam suggested Jekyll with a plugin for an external search provider, indextank: https://indextank.com/
[09:15:53] <jzaefferer> the free version limits you to 100k docs to index, which is plenty for our requirements
[09:16:22] <toddparker> interesting
[09:16:23] <jzaefferer> I've recently played around with elasticsearch, which builds upon lucene, but is pretty easy to use via a http/json api: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/
[09:17:13] <toddparker> both seem nice
[09:17:14] <jzaefferer> my idea was to set up a deployment script that generates the static files, then dumps all content into the index, and offers a single dynamic page that uses queries the index for search
[09:17:32] <jzaefferer> could even proxy the query-resource and implement that completely in javascript
[09:18:02] <jzaefferer> that way the indexing would be accessbile only on the server for the deployment script, the search almost directly exposed to the client
[09:18:48] <jzaefferer> good to know that mobile docs also need something like that, that adds to the pile of api-docs, qunit site, learn site...
[09:19:08] <jzaefferer> seems to me like it would be worth to roll our own solution?
[09:20:31] <jzaefferer> well, if someone has ideas or interest in prototyping, let me know
[09:20:48] <jzaefferer> kborchers, what are the menu/menubar issues/todos you're working on?
[09:20:59] <jzaefferer> the input stuff is still wip, anything else?
[09:21:39] <kborchers> just going to start on the other todos on menu ... also looking at text inputs for menu as well
[09:21:52] <toddparker> k
[09:22:13] <kborchers> had an interesting conversation with someone that would like to see a combination of checkboxes with text inputs to do filtering of a map app they have
[09:23:10] <jzaefferer> in regards to the input menu: this seems to add quite a lot of overhead to menu and is somewhat of a specialized usecase - I missed the menu meeting where I should have mentioned that, so comes a little late
[09:23:21] <jzaefferer> but I'm wondering if that should be an extension instead of builtin
[09:23:32] <jzaefferer> especially if there's even more features to consider
[09:24:20] <toddparker> +1
[09:24:51] <jzaefferer> other then that: felixge started working on a node-based build script, to be used by download builder, but didn't finish it so far and now got absorbed into new client work :/
[09:25:24] <jzaefferer> I'm going to followup on him to get at least the build script done
[09:26:47] <jzaefferer> well, I guess we can wrap this up. kborchers, let's chat more about the menu stuff
[09:27:00] <kborchers> in dev?
[09:27:10] <jzaefferer> there was too little communication in the last few weeks, need to catch up on that
[09:27:17] <jzaefferer> too much going through pull requests
[09:27:22] <jzaefferer> that or a Skype call?
[09:28:39] <kborchers> dev is prob better as i am at my day job
[09:28:43] <jzaefferer> k
[10:03:35] <jzaefferer> anyone around that wants to talk about the Grid project?
[10:03:50] <borismoore> I'm here
[10:04:23] <borismoore> But we already sync'ed up :)
[10:04:24] <brado23> Here too.
[10:04:30] <jzaefferer> we've been considering switching back to regular skype calls with a limited group, as it seems like participation in irc is very low to nothing anyway - we share the actual updates via jquery.org/updates anyway
[10:04:46] <borismoore> works for me - seems like a good idea
[10:04:58] <brado23> sounds good
[10:05:37] <jzaefferer> I'd probably start with a smaller Skype group then we at the last time - doesn't help to have two dozen contacts in there that don't pick up anyway
[10:06:19] <borismoore> Right now we could call on the three way we already have set up
[10:07:31] <jzaefferer> wanna do a call now? I'd look for a quite room then
[10:07:44] <borismoore> if that works for you, sure
[10:07:52] <brado23> fine by me
[10:11:49] <jzaefferer> brado23, Y U NO SKYPE? :p
[10:12:31] <brado23> Sigh.  Sorry.  Skype crashes whenever my laptop sleeps.  Hold on.
[10:12:38] <jzaefferer> k
