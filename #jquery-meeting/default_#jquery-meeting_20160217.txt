[12:01:35] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:15] <fnagel> hey
[12:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> So, I never got around to seeing if specifying the JDK on Travis works for node projects.
[12:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> I can try that after the meeting.
[12:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz sent a PR to fix the selectmenu icon position right before last week's meeting.
[12:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1671
[12:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer had a question though.
[12:04:37] <arschmitz> yeahi need to update docs
[12:04:44] <arschmitz> for more then just jzaeffers thing
[12:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1671#discussion_r52570941
[12:04:57] <arschmitz> because it also adds a new class
[12:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:05:16] <arschmitz> ui-selectmenu-icon
[12:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> Can you commit to either fixing the docs or filing an issue on api.jqueryui.com by EOD?
[12:05:38] <arschmitz> yeah ill just fix the docs
[12:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> So the PR is good to land as is, right?
[12:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: ^
[12:08:31] <arschmitz> yes
[12:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> wonderful
[12:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> On to new things!
[12:08:43] <arschmitz> just need to rebase to add the pr ref
[12:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a regression in menu.
[12:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> The active styling is incorrect when you hover a submenu then click outside the menu.
[12:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14919
[12:09:54] <scott_gonzalez> This can be seen on the default demo: http://view.jqueryui.com/1.12.0-beta.1/demos/menu/default.html
[12:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> Just hover a parent, then a sub menu, then click outside.
[12:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> You can also see that once you're in the wrong state, you can then use the keyboard to focus a different item.
[12:10:47] <arschmitz> ahh yup
[12:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> This results in two items being styled as active.
[12:10:55] <arschmitz> we changed how the active styling worked
[12:11:01] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i think worked on it
[12:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think we didn't used to style the parent.
[12:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we had different styling.
[12:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> There was active vs. focus.
[12:11:36] <arschmitz> yup
[12:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/0bbd1569182bc03e8dc4f5f8aa203e8edbe15f99
[12:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that was a year ago.
[12:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> We also have a regression in resizable (though this regression happened during 1.11): https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14916
[12:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, arschmitz don't forget that you have to manually close the ticket and add the commit reference in a comment when you land the selectmenu fix.
[12:17:16] <arschmitz> oh yeah
[12:17:19] <arschmitz> thank you
[12:17:21] <scott_gonzalez> The SHA won't autolink because repo synchronization is manual right now, but it'll eventually work.
[12:17:32] <arschmitz> yeah iv been following the infra issue
[12:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> So don't worry when the SHA shows up gray and doesn't link to GitHub after you write the comment.
[12:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> That's everyone from the agenda. Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> s/everyone/everything/
[12:20:16] <b-ot> Correction, <scott_gonzalez> That's everything from the agenda. Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:21:04] <fnagel> new shortcuts?
[12:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> b-ot has handled replacements for a while.
[12:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that's what you're referring to.
[12:22:32] <fnagel> right, but I'Ve neber seen you using this one before :-D
[12:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yeah, I do that a lot for my typos. And then one day b-ot just started acknowledging them :-)
[12:23:42] <fnagel> Win Win
[12:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
