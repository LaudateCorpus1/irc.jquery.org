[14:06:52] <sfrisk> I wanted to finish up the rest of the PR cleanup, we only have 7 items left to review
[14:18:24] <arschmitz> hi sorry

[14:20:47] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:21:56] <sfrisk> I wrote what I know of the current status of the open PRs
[14:22:08] <sfrisk> I'm inclined to say that the two [WIP] items should be closed
[14:22:19] <sfrisk> since at this point we haven't heard anything in awhile
[14:22:28] <arschmitz> +1
[14:24:21] <sfrisk> Upgrade JSCS is pretty much done, I want to add in indentation checking before I pull it in however
[14:26:30] <sfrisk> which shouldn't take too long
[14:27:06] <sfrisk> the Accessibility testing pr has some merge conflicts some of the gruntfiles/ tasks
[14:27:33] <sfrisk> I'm in the process of trying to merge them together
[14:27:50] <arschmitz> ok let me know i can do that if you need
[14:27:58] <sfrisk> most of the issues was with connect.js
[14:31:35] <sfrisk> were with*
[14:35:43] <sfrisk> I have a base pass of the button pr for sizes/colors, but I really don't like the spacing/colors so I'm going to tweak that this week
[14:39:24] <sfrisk> Okay, I'm gonna call it for the day
[14:39:46] <sfrisk> I'll have buttons polished up a bit and in views.css-chassis.com by next week for review
[14:41:16] <sfrisk> See everyone next week
