[09:01:19] <DaveMethvin> hellooooo!
[09:02:18] <gibson042> la la laaaah
[09:02:23] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:02:42] <DaveMethvin> just got back from vacation so i'm all disorganized
[09:02:49] <DaveMethvin> like normal, in other words
[09:03:22] <DaveMethvin> i bet m_gol is around somewhere too
[09:03:37] <DaveMethvin> timmywil you here?
[09:03:46] <timmywil> yea
[09:03:52] <DaveMethvin> awesome
[09:04:16] <DaveMethvin> so i don't have an agenda ... let's make one :)
[09:05:15] <timmywil> I'm currently having a brain fart. What's that project that expands div+ul>li into HTML?
[09:05:31] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean the editor plugin?
[09:05:33] <DaveMethvin> it's a guys name
[09:06:05] <timmywil> emmet?
[09:06:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think that's it
[09:06:27] <timmywil> Ah yea, "zen coding" is what I was trying to think of.
[09:07:03] <DaveMethvin> ok, we have a bunch of stuff in trac for this release that hasn't been started or assigned
[09:07:48] <DaveMethvin> markelog: did you send around something on your xhr thoughts? if so i haven't dug down that deep in my inbox
[09:07:52] <DaveMethvin> i seem to recall there was
[09:08:11] <markelog> i did
[09:08:13] <markelog> there you go
[09:08:14] <markelog> https://gist.github.com/markelog/5a5aec471886a863a136
[09:09:17] <DaveMethvin> reading it now
[09:09:46] <markelog> we could take some ideas from it or most ideas or just couple :-)
[09:09:54] <DaveMethvin> i like that it fully externalizes stuff both before and after the request is sent
[09:10:03] <DaveMethvin> just the opposite of $.ajax
[09:10:08] <markelog> or none of course
[09:10:21] <gibson042> +1 to that
[09:10:22] <DaveMethvin> i had only considered externalizing the part after a request was sent
[09:10:40] <DaveMethvin> which leaves a few hard things that would have to be handled by a beforeSend callback
[09:10:45] <DaveMethvin> or some other mechanism
[09:10:55] <DaveMethvin> so let me take a look at this and think about it
[09:11:03] <DaveMethvin> everyone else as well, please
[09:11:09] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[09:11:12] <markelog> okay, cool
[09:11:59] <DaveMethvin> grrr, trac is still horribly show
[09:12:01] <DaveMethvin> sow
[09:12:02] <DaveMethvin> slow
[09:12:06] <markelog> so slow )
[09:12:31] <DaveMethvin> i saw an email or two go by discussing the config so i hope it will be worked on soon
[09:13:15] <DaveMethvin> i am working on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12031, need to write some code soon
[09:14:03] <DaveMethvin> it seems like it's gonna change some of the internal data structures, so I suspect the folks who are using undocumented internals will have their stuff broken
[09:15:59] <DaveMethvin> so can we get work started on some of these issues? http://goo.gl/NsAfgV
[09:16:08] <DaveMethvin> how does everyone's schedule look for August?
[09:17:04] <markelog> for jQ conf?
[09:17:28] <DaveMethvin> i would like to have at least a solid beta by the
[09:17:30] <DaveMethvin> then
[09:17:49] <markelog> so we need to decide on xhr soon
[09:17:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:17:59] <m_gol> oops, present
[09:18:28] <markelog> what do we need to do, apart from 12031 and xhr?
[09:18:41] <DaveMethvin> http://goo.gl/NsAfgV
[09:18:55] <DaveMethvin> several are still not assigned
[09:18:57] <markelog> it died on me
[09:19:15] <DaveMethvin> and we are probably missing some from that list
[09:20:21] <m_gol> my schedule is pretty tight for the next few weeks unfortunately
[09:20:21] <DaveMethvin> just looking through the list now
[09:20:35] <m_gol> and it seems most of what's left is used to fight with infra ;-D
[09:20:43] <gibson042> I'm planning to knock out several of my assigned tickets in the next couple of weeks
[09:21:02] <DaveMethvin> someone needs to keep the testing working m_gol, so thanks for that!
[09:21:09] <DaveMethvin> ok good gibson042
[09:21:27] <DaveMethvin> i don't think i'll be traveling much in august after this weeks
[09:21:33] <gibson042> but from what I remember, only one or two come with new surface area
[09:21:41] <DaveMethvin> so i hope to get a lot of my stuff done
[09:21:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah there are just a few breaking changes
[09:21:56] <DaveMethvin> not bigly breaking
[09:22:18] <DaveMethvin> i think the biggest challenge will be $.xhr
[09:22:23] <m_gol> timmywil: you broke effects tests ;)
[09:22:37] <gibson042> I agree re: .xhr
[09:22:39] <timmywil> yea, sorry, I need to look at that
[09:22:43] <DaveMethvin> i don't really like the idea of adding a bunch of bytes so we have to see how big that will be
[09:23:16] <markelog> if main design is acceptable i would like to implement it
[09:23:20] <markelog> *mine
[09:23:32] <m_gol> *my ;)
[09:23:37] <DaveMethvin> i like the general idea myself
[09:23:38] <markelog> ((
[09:23:43] <markelog> dammit
[09:23:57] <timmywil> *damn it
[09:24:09] <DaveMethvin> i know, i didn't take my computer with me on vacation and seems like i forgot how to type :)
[09:24:10] * timmywil throws down the mic
[09:24:17] <markelog> (((
[09:25:16] <DaveMethvin> some of these tickets already have pulls that try to address tehm
[09:25:17] <DaveMethvin> them
[09:25:33] <DaveMethvin> the promise interop for example
[09:25:49] <DaveMethvin> so there may be even less work to do than it looks
[09:26:19] <DaveMethvin> then there's that parser error message in sizzle, it will take a week to bikeshed that one :)
[09:27:04] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: would you be able to grab http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14960 ?
[09:27:19] <gibson042> sure
[09:27:29] <gibson042> I was actually just looking to see if it was already done
[09:27:36] <DaveMethvin> we may need to pull that optimization
[09:27:42] <gibson042> that's my plan
[09:28:19] <DaveMethvin> less code, good!
[09:28:40] <timmywil> I'll go ahead an swap the error message, but I'm keeping it terse.
[09:28:53] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:28:55] <m_gol> I'm having hard time following when I need to wait 30s for trac each time after clicking on a link :P
[09:29:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, what a pain
[09:30:27] <DaveMethvin> I think most of these open tix can be fixed pretty easily
[09:30:51] <DaveMethvin> there is the question of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15037 though
[09:31:14] <DaveMethvin> is everyone okay with putting a big warning on .show() that says to use class names instead?
[09:31:48] <DaveMethvin> basically as gibson042 says we've dug a hole here
[09:31:53] <DaveMethvin> and i doubt we can dig out
[09:32:09] <m_gol> it's one of these things that is very cool to be able to put up quick demos...
[09:32:15] <m_gol> ...and terrible for everything else :D
[09:32:26] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can use that as an excuse to get rid of the defaultDisplay mess
[09:32:48] <DaveMethvin> basically say .show()/.hide() have these limits and don't complain about them
[09:33:24] <DaveMethvin> after all there is no RIGHT answer because we would have to predict what you're planning to do
[09:33:33] <gibson042> I'd like to see someone *try* to dig us out... better to break backcompat than to carry forward unpredictable behavior
[09:33:54] <DaveMethvin> if you have some ideas we could try them
[09:34:10] <m_gol> timmywil: the breakage is caused by a #dl element having height 0, width 1
[09:34:17] <m_gol> so it's now hidden
[09:34:35] <m_gol> so I guess I'll just change the assertion
[09:34:53] <m_gol> btw, it should be an "equal", not "ok"
[09:35:45] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: in short, I think .show() should operate only on inline styles and ignore stylesheets
[09:35:50] <timmywil> I only checked css tests when I changed that.
[09:36:11] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: i'm okay with that
[09:36:34] <timmywil> We could just say you get display: block no matter what. If you want something else, use classes.
[09:36:49] <timmywil> or css
[09:36:53] <m_gol> timmywil: ok, I'll commit the change then since the change is intentional
[09:37:06] <timmywil> m_gol: thanks
[09:37:06] <DaveMethvin> also that means we force the style to hidden for .hide() even if it's disconnected or whatever
[09:37:13] <gibson042> well, we'd never need to set display: block... only remove display: none
[09:37:16] <gibson042> yep
[09:37:29] <m_gol> I like what y'all saying
[09:37:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah and it won't break ANYTHING .... hahahaha
[09:37:49] <markelog> so hide would not hide anything?
[09:38:04] <m_gol> "HOW COULD YOU" etc.
[09:38:06] <markelog> oh, didn't read that right
[09:38:09] <gibson042> no, we're explicitly breaking things to beat them into shape
[09:38:10] <markelog> sorry )
[09:38:15] <gibson042> major release, baby :D
[09:38:20] <DaveMethvin> well if its display: none by default ... youd want that to show by setting display:block at least
[09:38:26] <timmywil> gibson042: yea, but it's hard to say which is more common. Setting display: none in my stylesheet, then using .show() to show it later seems like it could be a common use case.
[09:38:36] <DaveMethvin> yes it is for me )
[09:38:52] <DaveMethvin> you can break anything you want, but not MY code :)
[09:39:19] <m_gol> the simple use case is to swap display: whatever with display: none
[09:39:23] <m_gol> we can store the whatever
[09:39:28] <gibson042> m_gol: bingo
[09:39:34] <DaveMethvin> the thing that I don't like the most is defaultDisplay
[09:39:48] <m_gol> anything else, requiring to go into visibility or parents will only cause problems as we see now
[09:39:56] <gibson042> I think this approach would eliminate defaultDisplay
[09:39:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:40:09] <timmywil> There's another library that just does display: block and display: none no matter what. I can't remember right now which one.
[09:40:45] <DaveMethvin> it would be interesting to see how many bytes it buys us to make it that simple
[09:40:49] <timmywil> oh! angular
[09:41:23] <timmywil> We could align with angular and still be rid of defaultDisplay
[09:41:58] <markelog> let's look how many tests it would break, it would get us the full picture
[09:42:03] <timmywil> anyway, we could discuss this more in email or something.
[09:42:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's worth a look
[09:42:29] <DaveMethvin> sorry guys, i have to run
[09:42:39] <timmywil> yea, I'm fine with experimenting
[09:42:50] <DaveMethvin> i'll try to get some things done this week
[09:43:07] <timmywil> cya dave
[09:43:09] <DaveMethvin> please do the same, let's see what we can do to move this release
[09:43:18] <DaveMethvin> i'll close the room then
