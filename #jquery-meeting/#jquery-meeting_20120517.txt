[11:05:46] <toddparker> hi
[11:06:19] <toddparker> The jQuery Mobile meeting is starting. Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OHHVS-MSccLT34IyIy4AXexMcIvRNWpGx87lweT6Gk/edit

[11:11:05] <toddparker> jQM Modularity  ////////////////////////////////////////////////
[11:11:18] <toddparker> I’ve heard a bunch of questions recently about how monolithic the library is. I know we’ve done a lot of decoupling work internally and now have the download builder which will help quite a bit.
[11:11:19] <toddparker> Modularity questions: how much make we break things up for consumption:
[11:11:21] <toddparker> Only want utilities like touch events, zoom fix, orientation (not yet?)
[11:11:22] <toddparker> Want a specific subset of widgets and transitions (yes)
[11:11:24] <toddparker> Only want certain widgets, no nav model (yes)
[11:11:25] <toddparker> Only want nav model/transitions, no widgets or CSS framework (yes)
[11:11:26] <toddparker> How to define mobile “core”
[11:11:27] <toddparker> I’d like to do some analysis for LOE and see if we should focus on this for 1.3.
[11:13:32] <toddparker> more decoupling needed - $.mobile
[11:32:15] <toddparker> Team  ////////////////////////////////////////////////
[11:32:46] <toddparker> Adobe changes - Bender staying, Kin & Tyler being re-assigned
[11:32:55] <toddparker> hopefully, more adobe help will come

[11:39:07] <toddparker> Popup for 1.2 /////////////////////////////
[11:39:17] <toddparker> Stacking or mutually exclusive
[11:39:19] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget-stack/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[11:39:28] <toddparker> ^^ branch with stacking in use
