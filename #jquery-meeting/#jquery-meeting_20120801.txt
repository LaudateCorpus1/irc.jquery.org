[09:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:02:23] <gnarf> hey!
[09:02:31] <jzaefferer> ding
[09:04:16] <jzaefferer> so, it has come to his
[09:04:18] <jzaefferer> *this
[09:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> Not too much to discuss today.
[09:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> We're moving forward on docs.
[09:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Same for download builder.
[09:04:43] <jzaefferer> we are?
[09:04:57] <jzaefferer> What happened on docs?
[09:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers was working on CSS.
[09:05:22] <gnarf> that brave man
[09:05:32] * gnarf raises a mug of coffee to kborchers
[09:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be working on content soon. Just been trying to get through this upgrade guide.
[09:06:07] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:06:49] <jzaefferer> this is what kborchers worked on, right? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/style-updates
[09:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yes
[09:09:55] <jzaefferer> we should put the upgrade guide in full into the 1.9 release post, just to show how epic that release is
[09:10:10] <jzaefferer> how much do you have covered now?
[09:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> I have about 75% more of the widget and all of effects to do.
[09:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> So getting close.
[09:11:07] <jzaefferer> ah, okay, not seeing widget yet in the gist
[09:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4b08ed85f1302cf1005b
[09:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just updated it.
[09:13:17] <jzaefferer> that's just 25% of widget?
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:13:35] <jzaefferer> wow
[09:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> I know.
[09:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's two years worth of ideas...
[09:14:10] <jzaefferer> you should mention that $.widget.extend is now used internally instead of $.extend
[09:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> Good point.
[09:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'm definitely going to need to do at least one more pass through this after I finish.
[09:14:39] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:15:19] <jzaefferer> Once 1.9 is out, we need to tell all jQuery event organizers to "only accept talks about plugin development if the jQuery UI widget factory is explicitly mentioned at least once in the abstract"
[09:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> +1
[09:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: color?
[09:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's not really anything else to discuss?
[09:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have something to add?
[09:19:42] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess we're done.
[09:21:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'll look again at color today
[09:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
