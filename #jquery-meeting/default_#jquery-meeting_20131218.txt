[09:01:20] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:25] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:40] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:01:40] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:01:48] <tj_vantoll> `read
[09:01:48] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 5d 16h ago: touch-action on handles only, not the whole element
[09:04:22] <arschmitz> here
[09:04:37] <kborchers> weird, i didn't get an alert when i was mentioned
[09:04:44] <kborchers> anyways, i'm here
[09:04:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to start with AMD?
[09:05:43] <rxaviers> sure
[09:05:59] <rxaviers> I've been working on  "Update or replace resource loader with an AMD loader. If that turns out to be a bad idea, add a test for each widget that loads it via AMD"
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> minimal change: https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/commits/UMD-amdify-tests-minimal
[09:06:27] <rxaviers> I have just produced two flavors for this change: (a) Minimal change , (b) AMDify tests , which I describe better here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029#issuecomment-30845291
[09:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> AMDified tests: https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/commits/UMD-amdify-tests
[09:06:44] <rxaviers> thanks ;)
[09:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> np
[09:07:14] <rxaviers> So, basically we can compare them, and pick one
[09:08:33] <rxaviers> I guess that's it
[09:08:46] <tj_vantoll> How does this compare to what mobile does?
[09:09:58] <tj_vantoll> Looks like they don't use AMD within their tests.
[09:10:08] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: we do
[09:10:28] <rxaviers> the minimum way is similar with the way mobile does.
[09:10:50] <rxaviers> as far as I understood it (mobile can correct me), they use require in its asyncLoad helper function.
[09:10:56] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/controlgroup/index.html
[09:11:19] <arschmitz> rxaviers: thats correct
[09:11:42] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I guess I meant the test files themselves don't seem to be AMD modules.
[09:12:01] <rxaviers> right TJ, as my AMDify branch would do.
[09:12:11] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: no
[09:12:33] <tj_vantoll> Of the two I prefer the full AMD approach.
[09:13:54] <tj_vantoll> It seems like since we have the dependencies baked into the source files now we might as well use them.
[09:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> Can we just have everyone that cares comment on the PR before the end of the week?
[09:15:39] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good to me.
[09:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still waiting on some updates from Dylan for the tooltip PR.
[09:15:46] <rxaviers> sounds good to me too
[09:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged him to see if he's still interested in finishing it up.
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> Waiting to hear back from him.
[09:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Is there anything new to discuss about button this week?
[09:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if you started the alternate markup approach using spans for icons.
[09:17:37] <arschmitz> just that im working on a branch using spans instead of before and after
[09:17:53] <arschmitz> thats what bootstrap does
[09:18:01] <arschmitz> if you want an icon you add the span with the class
[09:18:21] <arschmitz> also created a wiki page and am porting the content from the google doc
[09:18:36] <arschmitz> and did device testing with a few dozen devices on current branch
[09:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I saw you tested something for having empty menu items.
[09:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't get a chance to look at what you did though.
[09:20:58] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: yes
[09:21:34] <fnagel> I've played around with the items option of Menu and adding classes to the items before init Menu but that doesnt work out
[09:21:59] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Did you notice the comments in the ticket?
[09:22:11] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: #9701
[09:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> I saw that there are comments, but didn't look at them yet.
[09:22:53] <fnagel> I think we need to modify Menu in some waa
[09:22:55] <fnagel> way
[09:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we may need to just add an option for whether dividers get used.
[09:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> Or perhaps just allow changing how a divider is.
[09:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check the code real quick.
[09:24:08] <fnagel> See the comment, ive added a link to the relvant code lines
[09:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> What if we just move https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L309-L316 into a method?
[09:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> Then selectmenu can override that method for the menu instance it creates.
[09:25:57] <fnagel> That should work, we could add a class and test for it in that method
[09:26:10] <tj_vantoll1> I like that approach as well.
[09:26:16] <arschmitz> +1
[09:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably just move this one line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L313
[09:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> _isDivider: function( item ) { ... }
[09:26:37] <fnagel> works for me
[09:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> I updated the ticket.
[09:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> It captures that idea and makes the ticket a blocker for 1.11.
[09:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else that needs to be discussed for selectmenu, or just general issues that are being dealt with in -dev and the wiki?
[09:30:37] <fnagel> Alex reported some mobile issues I will dig into, so no not for now
[09:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> Great.
[09:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You around?
[09:31:14] <arschmitz> fnagel: if you need any more details or testing on that just let me know
[09:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Time for the big Globalize news :-)
[09:32:36] <fnagel> arschmitz: thanks, pretty busy atm but I'll let you know
[09:33:00] <rxaviers> =)
[09:33:30] <rxaviers> We now have Globalize CLDR  landed on master.
[09:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> \o/
[09:34:04] <tj_vantoll1> :)
[09:34:06] <rxaviers> At least, the very first beginning of the work...
[09:34:18] <rxaviers> 1.0.0-pre
[09:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> And collaboration with other projects is going well.
[09:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers has been talking with lots of other projects that deal with i18n and getting them on board to have a common base from CLDR data.
[09:35:35] <scott_gonzalez> And where possible, have the projects depend on each other.
[09:36:00] <rxaviers> Exactly, we have good ongoing talks with moment.js, and mediawiki (Krinkle). I've also started a thread on twitter-cldr
[09:37:13] <rxaviers> Tomorrow, we have another Globalize/CLDR/moment.js/mediawiki meeting
[09:37:31] <rxaviers> Well, lots have been done. I don't know where to start
[09:37:32] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's the big news that should be announced.
[09:38:18] <rxaviers> :)
[09:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> For technical details, you can look at the commits or ping rxaviers.
[09:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> He's made a lot of progress so far.
[09:38:50] <rxaviers> Yeap, Im really really excited on where all this is going.
[09:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> Me too.
[09:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: Any updates for datepicker?
[09:40:06] <tj_vantoll1> None. I spent most of my time getting this ready https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1152
[09:40:56] <tj_vantoll1> It should be ready to be reviewed. Our CSS linter is still going to be an issue though.
[09:41:07] <tj_vantoll1> My pull to the parser got merged https://github.com/nzakas/parser-lib/pull/98
[09:41:24] <tj_vantoll1> But it still has to be versioned and make it through a few projects before we can use it.
[09:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. Do you want to harass him about that?
[09:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> I can do it if you don't want to be a nag.
[09:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> He should be able to do a release for 2 of the 3 projects.
[09:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> Getting the grunt plugin updated should be easy.
[09:43:44] <tj_vantoll1> I'll comment on that pull request and see what he says.
[09:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:44:26] <tj_vantoll1> What was the other project that needed a version?
[09:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> csslint
[09:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> parser-lib, csslint, grunt-contrib-csslint
[09:45:54] <tj_vantoll1> Ok thanks.
[09:51:05] <tj_vantoll1> Commented https://github.com/nzakas/parser-lib/pull/98#issuecomment-30863884
[09:51:10] <tj_vantoll1> That's all I had.
