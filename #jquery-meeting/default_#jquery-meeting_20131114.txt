[11:02:51] <agcolom> Hi
[11:03:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you here?
[11:03:34] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:03:48] <uGoMobi> hey agcolom and _|Nix|_
[11:04:21] <uGoMobi> gseguin toddmparker RWhitbeck ?
[11:04:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin did an awesome job fixing dependencies in master.
[11:04:53] <uGoMobi> great
[11:04:57] <uGoMobi> thanks gseguin !
[11:05:05] <_|Nix|_> He made it possible to use jQM as a submodule of web-ui-fw (again).
[11:05:25] <arschmitz> here sorry
[11:05:31] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:05:48] <uGoMobi> so, everyone is back home again :)
[11:06:19] <uGoMobi> let's get started
[11:06:42] <uGoMobi> some new issues have been reported
[11:06:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I take https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6677?
[11:06:49] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6677 by didiergm (2w 2d ago): Demos- Classic theme
[11:07:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes please
[11:07:13] <_|Nix|_> OK. It's mine! All mine! My precious!
[11:07:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's a problem with the build script
[11:07:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it works on server
[11:07:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Build order perchance?
[11:07:57] <uGoMobi> nah, we change the source url's
[11:08:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK.
[11:08:34] <uGoMobi> and that demo uses a different CSS source because we don't want default theme there
[11:08:46] <_|Nix|_> Riiiight ...
[11:09:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe you can also give that Backbone Require demo issue a look
[11:09:17] <uGoMobi> same category ;)
[11:09:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:11:06] <uGoMobi> I didn't have much time after last week's meeting so I am still working on TR update
[11:11:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz got the DB working on the new site
[11:11:27] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[11:11:38] <uGoMobi> yes indeed!
[11:11:45] <arschmitz> yup actually about that
[11:12:04] <arschmitz> just so every one know the jquery-mobile-downloadbuilder repo is now dead
[11:12:29] <uGoMobi> it's on jquery-mobile-com now?
[11:12:38] <arschmitz> part
[11:12:39] <uGoMobi> or whatever the exact repo name is
[11:12:48] <arschmitz> and part is in jquery-wp-content
[11:12:53] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:13:04] <arschmitz> but issues should go against jquerymobile.com
[11:13:08] <_|Nix|_> Where can I see the beauty?
[11:13:23] <arschmitz> stage.jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[11:13:38] <arschmitz> also the download builder also now works on stage and local
[11:13:41] <arschmitz> it did not before
[11:14:05] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:14:19] <_|Nix|_> Extremely cool!
[11:14:54] <_|Nix|_> The "Select Branch" label is above and to the right of the dropdown containing the versions ...
[11:15:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean?
[11:15:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in what browser?
[11:15:58] <arschmitz> it should be directly above and lined up with the dropdown
[11:16:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: FF
[11:16:36] <arschmitz> oh in ff yeah i see it
[11:16:51] <arschmitz> ill check it out the dropdown is oddly formated also
[11:17:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, is this the common UI/Mobile DB?
[11:17:19] <arschmitz> no
[11:17:21] <uGoMobi> nope
[11:17:34] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'm confused ...
[11:17:54] <arschmitz> its the same one we had just on the new website
[11:17:58] <uGoMobi> same download builder but moved to new web site
[11:18:00] <arschmitz> with a few minor updates
[11:18:06] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:18:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaaah, OK ...
[11:18:26] <arschmitz> the ui one is not finished yet it currently does not handle css
[11:18:34] <arschmitz> we will likely switch to that for 1.5
[11:18:37] <uGoMobi> yeah, I think I saw fixed toolbar widget twice but that is fixed now
[11:18:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, I saw the discussion about them using comments like we do.
[11:19:02] <arschmitz> yeah we decided that at the meeting last week
[11:19:05] <arschmitz> you were there :)
[11:19:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but now I saw it in the works.
[11:19:50] <_|Nix|_> Man ... we're slowly getting there ... awesome!
[11:19:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yea i dont think its actually started yet there we just some implementation questions we went over in an issue and yesterday in dev leads meeting
[11:20:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ... now I remember! It was in the dev leads meeting minutes.
[11:20:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks for switching docs from xhtml to html
[11:21:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz and _|Nix|_ : would be great if you could take care of the remaining demos issues (I'll make a new homepage)
[11:21:55] <uGoMobi> then I'll focus on TR and new web site
[11:22:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I looked at the panel issue and I realized that perhaps the nav menu is not well placed as a specially styled panel ...
[11:22:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yea i have the nested list demo finished
[11:22:17] <uGoMobi> I have some more time tomorrow and this weekend
[11:22:39] <arschmitz> i updated the plugin so now it uses exact same markup as 1.3
[11:23:01] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:23:02] <arschmitz> all you do is drop in the plugin and it restores 1.3 behivor basicly no special markup at all
[11:23:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I think transferring it to an in-flow element whenever a panel opens may be too heavy.
[11:23:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, maybe... I suggest we just work around it
[11:23:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Excellent!
[11:24:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it works everywhere unless there is another panel on the page that uses a wrapper (push and reveal)
[11:24:09] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[11:24:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so it's only one page
[11:25:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi: no problem. I'm just doing the easy stuff :-) big thx to _|Nix|_ and all of you for the hard work on the api docs for 1.4!
[11:25:32] <uGoMobi> yeah, great job!
[11:26:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: NP! Let's hope come our revised workflow we won't have to make so many updates after the fact.
[11:26:50] <uGoMobi> yeah, we have to learn from this
[11:27:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you removed that comma that broke IE7 right?
[11:28:21] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:28:52] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[11:28:58] <_|Nix|_> I'm still perplexed as to why the linter missed that.
[11:29:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its not set to detect them
[11:29:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It was before ...
[11:29:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you have to enable es3 mode
[11:29:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope
[11:29:42] <uGoMobi> let's try to do some triage too, issue count went above 300
[11:29:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah ill do some
[11:30:13] <uGoMobi> cool, thanks
[11:30:36] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss here?
[11:30:45] <arschmitz> its inevitable for it to rise becuase we cant do fixes but im sure i can close a bunch
[11:31:03] <uGoMobi> yeah, I know
[11:31:27] <_|Nix|_> I already have a bunch of local commits that will close, like, 3 issues.
[11:31:30] <uGoMobi> it's more that we have to give test, comment, add label, etc
[11:31:46] <arschmitz> yea
[11:31:48] <uGoMobi> s/to give test/to test/
[11:33:45] <uGoMobi> I think that was all
[11:34:03] <agcolom> I'm disappearing... will catch up later
[11:34:10] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: L8R!
[11:34:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: later
[11:35:06] <_|Nix|_> BTW: I may have discovered a bug with core.
[11:35:18] <_|Nix|_> Our build keeps failing, and it seems to be because of core.
[11:35:30] <_|Nix|_> It only fails against the git version of core.
[11:35:40] <uGoMobi> interesting
[11:35:56] <_|Nix|_> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile
[11:36:02] <uGoMobi> (travis loads slow)
[11:36:12] <_|Nix|_> I'm not sure how to provide a minimal test case for core.
[11:36:20] <arschmitz> yeah git core is broken
[11:36:23] <_|Nix|_> We're doing this._on( this.document, ... )
[11:36:26] <arschmitz> its known they are fixing it
[11:36:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. Good.
[11:37:01] <arschmitz> you can see convo in backscroll on #jquery-dev
[11:37:38] <_|Nix|_> I wish ... I shall have to consult my logs (and get my new HDD up and running ASAP) ...
[11:37:45] <_|Nix|_> s/my logs/the logs/
[11:37:57] <arschmitz> oh yeah forgot it quit out on you
[11:38:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lasted about 10 years, so I guess I can't complain.
[11:38:46] <arschmitz> ok i think we car wrap it up here
[11:38:51] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:38:57] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:38:58] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[11:39:06] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
