[12:00:16] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it might just be us today.
[12:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> I spend a bunch of time going through Trac yesterday.
[12:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> It all started with this PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1793
[12:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> It was filed mostly just to add an extension point for scrolling.
[12:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> But it does fix a bunch of bugs.
[12:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> But now we need to figure out if these bugs have already been reported.
[12:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> The contributor did file a bunch of new tickets, but they're still filling in details (creating fiddles for each one).
[12:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> So I plan on going through all of the open tickets and trying to find duplicates when they're done.
[12:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> I also plan on asking this person if they want to take over the sortable plugin.
[12:04:27] <arschmitz> awesome
[12:04:54] <arschmitz> they seem to have a really good handle on it
[12:04:59] <arschmitz> certainly better then me lol
[12:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> After looking at sortable (and realizing it was insane how many tickets there are), I moved on to menu.
[12:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> I ended up fixing half the bugs.
[12:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> So I filed a ton of PRs for that.
[12:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> And we have a PR from arschmitz to fix the compatibility layer issue for checkboxradio
[12:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15109
[12:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1808
[12:07:59] <arschmitz> for some reason seems like im not getting linting and jscs locally :-/
[12:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> Once that's reviewed and merged, we can finally release! :-)
[12:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'll review that button PR.
