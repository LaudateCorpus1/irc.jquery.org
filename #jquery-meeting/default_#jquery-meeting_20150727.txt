[08:59:55] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol,arthurvr meeting tizime
[09:00:12] <timmywil> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BadwSO6Sn91RBfr05s77r81ncEi0oMBJ5mZS-k215vg/edit#
[09:00:41] <DaveMethvin> i just landed from Bangalore about an hour ago ... gonna do a knap
[09:00:44] <DaveMethvin> nap
[09:00:46] <DaveMethvin> geez
[09:00:54] <timmywil> but we like sleepy Dave
[09:00:56] <DaveMethvin> but i did get some PRs done in Migrate
[09:01:01] <timmywil> nice
[09:01:02] <DaveMethvin> if someone could review
[09:01:33] <DaveMethvin> i should be able to get a few more done this week, make tix for anything you think needs to be done
[09:01:47] <arthurvr> hey everybody
[09:01:52] <gibson0421> hullo
[09:01:58] <timmywil> yo
[09:02:07] <timmywil> Dave asked for review on some migrate PRs
[09:02:32] <m_gol> present
[09:02:59] <timmywil> iOS 6 and Safari 6 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2482
[09:03:05] <timmywil> I'm ok with this
[09:03:26] <m_gol> me too ;)
[09:03:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah sgtm
[09:03:45] <m_gol> although I'd prefer to drop Safari 8 :dreamer:
[09:03:46] <timmywil> ok, that was easy
[09:03:52] <timmywil> heh
[09:03:57] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2483 Android 2.3
[09:04:08] <timmywil> Leaning towards compat-only
[09:04:29] <timmywil> and checking whether compat works well enough in hybrid apps
[09:04:45] <m_gol> I still don't fully understand what would smoke-testing on master buy us if we'd stop supporting Android 2.3
[09:05:07] <timmywil> I think the point is that we don't add more bugs
[09:05:21] <m_gol> that means partial support
[09:05:25] <timmywil> existing ones don't seem to be causing a ruckus
[09:05:33] <timmywil> basically, yes
[09:05:34] <gibson0421> partial support is what I'm after
[09:05:35] <m_gol> and I think even on compat we shouldn't aim at passing 100%
[09:05:35] <DaveMethvin> i need to go back and re-read the whole thread to be sure, but i'm worried b/c there are still android 2.3 phones being sold
[09:05:55] <timmywil> well, let's take it one bug at a time
[09:06:08] <timmywil> we can close some issues wontfix
[09:06:09] <DaveMethvin> so we want some decent subset of stuff to be reliable, that was the purpose of the smoke test right?
[09:06:20] <timmywil> yea
[09:06:26] <timmywil> like, sizzle should work
[09:06:34] <gibson0421> analogous to jQuery Mobile grades
[09:06:35] <gibson0421> http://jquerymobile.com/browser-support/1.4/
[09:06:40] <m_gol> but if we're not removing current workarounds, it might be enough to just blacklist problematic tests
[09:07:07] <m_gol> btw, arschmitz said Mobile decided they're going to support Android 2.3 only in a way that old bugs don't re-appear, no new ones
[09:07:11] <timmywil> m_gol: you're more familiar, but I'd say it depends on how easy an issue is to fix
[09:07:12] <gibson0421> I want to remove the expensive workarounds when we drop to partial support, though
[09:07:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah, stuff like reliableMarginRight?
[09:07:36] <m_gol> gibson0421: that I'd like, it mostly means reliableMarginRight
[09:07:41] <gibson0421> exactly
[09:07:42] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:07:45] <m_gol> this is the only large one
[09:07:52] <timmywil> do we keep reliableMarginRight in compat?
[09:07:58] <gibson0421> I vote yes
[09:08:15] <timmywil> ok
[09:08:16] <m_gol> *if* we decide we support Android 2.3 more in compat than master then yes
[09:08:29] <markelog> how would we communicate to the user?
[09:08:29] <gibson0421> full support in compat, partial support in master
[09:08:56] <m_gol> gibson0421: what does full support mean, though? would it require fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1785?
[09:08:58] <markelog> full support, that is not realistic imo
[09:09:06] <m_gol> what about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1786?
[09:09:10] <arschmitz> if this is mostly about reliablemarginright
[09:09:11] <m_gol> yeah, that's one of my points
[09:09:19] <arschmitz> that seems very non critical
[09:09:25] <DaveMethvin> how bad does a page break if rMR isn't there? It still shows
[09:09:26] <m_gol> we can make Android 4.0 & newer pass all the tests, we can only pretend in Android 2.3
[09:09:32] <DaveMethvin> what arschmitz said
[09:09:47] <m_gol> it may return inaccurate margin values
[09:09:52] <arschmitz> i doubt thats going to actually break much
[09:09:55] <m_gol> distance to parent border instead of true margin value
[09:09:56] <m_gol> yeah
[09:10:00] <arschmitz> just cause some minor visual glitches
[09:10:12] <timmywil> markelog: do you have a specific issue in mind?
[09:10:24] <timmywil> that we can't fix
[09:10:25] <gibson0421> I'd say #1785 should be fixed in compat, but #1786 may be impossible because of over-divergence from master
[09:10:28] <timmywil> or shouldn't
[09:10:31] <m_gol> timmywil: mostly https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1786
[09:10:32] <arschmitz> i also thinks its pretty unlikely that anyone would even report that on android 2.3 even if they ran into it
[09:10:33] <markelog> all that are failling
[09:10:45] <markelog> this is crazy amount of time you would need to spend to support them
[09:10:46] <timmywil> markelog: let's get specific
[09:10:58] <markelog> and it would reflect on other environments
[09:10:59] <gibson0421> I'm with m_gol on #1786; it seems to be wontfix
[09:11:15] <markelog> globalEval is one thing
[09:11:20] <m_gol> we could try to fix 1785 on compat only
[09:11:46] <m_gol> we'd have to try to add Node testing on compat first, though
[09:11:49] <arschmitz> 1785 if this has never been seen by a non team member is it work investing any time at all in
[09:11:50] <m_gol> to check if this is feasible
[09:12:02] <timmywil> yea, 1786 looks like cantfix
[09:12:11] <timmywil> we can't force async:true, right?
[09:12:27] <timmywil> unless there's some hack
[09:12:35] <m_gol> the description is slightly inaccurate currently
[09:12:47] <m_gol> it seems errors from asynchronously inserted scripts don't propagate
[09:12:55] <m_gol> so can't be handled
[09:13:03] <timmywil> oh i see
[09:13:11] <markelog> i'd say we have bigger problems then 2.3 to focus on
[09:13:15] <timmywil> so we'd have to catch it
[09:13:28] <gibson0421> markelog: agreed on that too
[09:14:00] <timmywil> ok, maybe this is a better question. Which failing tests *can* we fix for 2.3?
[09:14:34] <m_gol> timmywil: the ajax bug locks up ajax tests so we cannot see everything now but I *think* this was mostly this script bug & radio buttons
[09:14:36] <markelog> all of them, i think
[09:14:50] <markelog> i'd say *want* is the real question
[09:14:52] <m_gol> and the fact that it times out a lot & requires manual restarts that take ages to make sure tests pass
[09:15:09] <timmywil> markelog: I mean, which wouldn't require a lot of effort to fix
[09:15:19] <m_gol> markelog: I don't think we can fix 1786 unless we made it worse for other browsers
[09:15:34] <markelog> m_gol: that is true for every android bug )
[09:15:40] <m_gol> lol
[09:16:34] <m_gol> timmywil: maybe 1785 could be done
[09:16:48] <markelog> if tendency of the android 2.3 drop is consistent, in 4-5 months we could be looking on big drop of market share
[09:16:51] <markelog> we could just wait
[09:16:59] <markelog> and don't anything at all
[09:17:08] <markelog> *don't do
[09:17:11] <timmywil> ok, how about we say wontfix on 1786 and keep 1785 open as compat-only?
[09:17:26] <gibson0421> yes, and deprioritized for effort
[09:17:31] <markelog> how would we communicate this to the end user?
[09:17:36] <gibson0421> all bugs are not created equal
[09:17:41] <timmywil> we can note it in the blog post
[09:17:48] <markelog> is that enough?
[09:18:12] <markelog> it is a good thing to read blog posts, but most users would be looking on api page
[09:18:20] <markelog> when working with jquery
[09:18:26] <m_gol> this would have to appear on http://jquery.com/browser-support/ as well, e.g. "In Android 2.3 only critical bugs are going to be fixed" or sth like that
[09:18:54] <timmywil> ^^
[09:18:58] <markelog> if that is not noted, if user don't know, he/she might not even know their suppose to use compat for their task
[09:19:28] <markelog> m_gol: that would be sufficient i think
[09:19:48] <m_gol> let's not forget that even compat-only not entirely basic Android 2.3 support will be a pain, albeit a little smaller than support on both branches
[09:19:53] <markelog> although we would need to think on how to phrase that right
[09:19:59] <timmywil> yea, list 2.3 in compat with an asterisk
[09:19:59] <gibson0421> arschmitz: have you found http://jquerymobile.com/browser-support/1.4/ to be a good format for communicating partial support?
[09:20:10] <gibson0421> maybe we adopt something like that
[09:20:24] <m_gol> alsom whatever we decide, this will need to stick until we release 4.0.0, whenever we do it (there may be minor releases in between)
[09:20:42] <markelog> gibson0421, arschmitz also interested in the answer to that
[09:21:02] <timmywil> with only one browser with partial support, we probably don't need a list like that
[09:21:18] <arschmitz> we actually dont like the graded support
[09:21:22] <m_gol> :)
[09:21:23] <arschmitz> its become an issue
[09:21:38] <markelog> timmywil: i guess we talking about the format, not the presentation of it
[09:21:39] <arschmitz> though mostly inrelation to core
[09:21:59] <markelog> arschmitz: a lot of thinks to consider?
[09:22:01] <timmywil> arschmitz: how so?
[09:22:01] <arschmitz> because we had a lot of things that were never officially tested or supported
[09:22:06] <markelog> with the graded support?
[09:22:14] <arschmitz> by core
[09:22:20] <arschmitz> so it ended up a nightmare for us
[09:22:46] <timmywil> like, you'd like it as A-grade and it wasn't fully supported in core?
[09:22:54] <arschmitz> even c grade
[09:23:03] <timmywil> ah yea
[09:23:10] <arschmitz> there is a weird build of a nokia browser that fails when you do basic stuff
[09:23:26] <arschmitz> so just loading core and running the tests to determin support made things fail
[09:23:37] <timmywil> well, for our purposes, I think all we need is a note about Android 2.3
[09:23:44] <arschmitz> which is also a difference we have checks in the lib to determin support levels
[09:23:50] <arschmitz> and different code paths
[09:23:50] <markelog> timmywil: i think so
[09:24:06] <arschmitz> yeah i would just stick with a note
[09:24:17] <markelog> what would the note says?
[09:24:18] <arschmitz> the more complex it gets the more edge cases creap in
[09:24:25] <markelog> partial support for compat?
[09:24:43] <markelog> no support in master?
[09:24:58] <timmywil> partial in master, full in compat. We have wontfix issues in all browsers.
[09:25:14] <markelog> if you say so
[09:25:14] <m_gol> so, to sum up, the proposal is to: 1) add non-browser support to compat, 2) on master make Android 2.3 run only very basic tests instead of almost everything as we currently do, 3) wontfix at least 1786 even on compat?
[09:25:14] <arschmitz> and its not like ie8 on master that wont parse
[09:25:17] <arschmitz> these are just bugs
[09:25:42] <timmywil> m_gol: that sums it up
[09:25:55] <m_gol> a note: when jQuery 2.0 was released, people still used Windows XP with IE8 as the default non-upgradeable browser
[09:26:00] <markelog> but we can fix 1786 for android 2.3 in compat?
[09:26:03] <m_gol> and yet jQuery 2.0 didn't even start to work on IE8
[09:26:08] <markelog> we can revert
[09:26:16] <timmywil> markelog: we can?
[09:26:17] <markelog> that would defienatly work
[09:26:30] <markelog> sure, it worked before
[09:26:34] <m_gol> so if we support Android 2.3 on compat, I think we might be able to drop it on master; but it seems most are against such a strategy
[09:26:55] <markelog> m_gol: i'm all for it
[09:27:14] <timmywil> it's a special situation where market share is dropping, but there are still new devices with 2.3, so partial support in master seems like a good idea.
[09:27:21] <m_gol> fixing 1786 on compat would mean reverting https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1449 which would mean a divergence between compat & master in globalEval
[09:27:25] <arschmitz> m_gol: there is a bit of a difference in that it was not possible to make ie8 work on 2.0
[09:27:30] <markelog> timmywil: so, revert?
[09:27:38] <arschmitz> android 2.3 works fine on master just with some bugs
[09:27:41] <timmywil> markelog: I'm not familiar with what we'd be reverting.
[09:28:03] <m_gol> timmywil: using a script tag for globalEval instead of an indirect eval
[09:28:10] <timmywil> oh right
[09:28:10] <markelog> it is all there in the issue :-)
[09:28:21] <markelog> there was a lot more of it there )
[09:28:22] <timmywil> duh
[09:28:30] <markelog> not that simple
[09:28:36] <m_gol> note that it was already broken in 2.1 for Android 2.3, it worked only in 1.11
[09:29:17] <markelog> full support on compat would mean revert of 1786
[09:29:18] <m_gol> markelog: yep, I simplified it to a tweet level ;)
[09:29:36] <timmywil> ok, I think it's worth exploring, and we'll evaluate the perf/size/maintenance costs.
[09:29:37] <markelog> which would mean master and compat would have different behaviours in all evns
[09:30:05] <markelog> or we would need to revert it in master as well
[09:30:29] <markelog> although, behaviour still would be different is certain situations
[09:30:50] <m_gol> I think this is one of those cases where suffering for all other browsers would be too big and it's better to screw Android 2.3 in this case
[09:31:10] <markelog> then it wouldn't be a "full support"
[09:31:55] <gibson0421> it seems https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1449 changed the behavior for errors anyway
[09:32:02] <m_gol> yeah, I wouldn't call it "full support", I'd still add a note on the browser-support page (I won't push for it too much, though)
[09:32:12] <gibson0421> for master & compat
[09:32:30] <gibson0421> since that landed, window.onerror is the only option
[09:32:35] <markelog> gibson0421: it did
[09:32:41] <gibson0421> and if Android 2.3 is broken, that's cantfix
[09:32:47] <markelog> but it is consistent
[09:32:57] <m_gol> I agree with gibson0421 here
[09:33:07] <gibson0421> what I'm saying is, since 1449 we no longer guarantee anything about errors
[09:33:21] <markelog> my main point that is not worth it :-)
[09:33:23] <gibson0421> so the behavior is unfortunate, but not our problem
[09:33:24] <markelog> all that fuzz
[09:33:34] <gibson0421> no need to revert it, even on 1449
[09:33:39] <gibson0421> err, even on compat
[09:33:44] <timmywil> so wontfix for both branches
[09:33:54] <gibson0421> yes
[09:34:04] <markelog> i would just suggest that these arguments https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2483#issuecomment-123763285
[09:34:19] <markelog> are sufficient enough to drop this thing
[09:37:34] <timmywil> I guess my only question: is the issue big enough to warrant a note on the browser support page?
[09:37:50] <markelog_> sorry, got disconnected
[09:38:18] <gibson0421> the broken window.onerror? I don't think that merits a note
[09:38:30] <timmywil> we could put it on the wontifx page
[09:38:43] <gibson0421> sure
[09:40:06] <m_gol> nota that whatever we decide now, we might still be supporting that thing in 2 years ;)
[09:40:57] <timmywil> Moving on, I listed 2 PRs that can land pending objections
[09:41:59] <timmywil> As far as gitter, I think I prefer to stick with irc.
[09:42:48] <markelog_> timmywil: did you try it?
[09:43:11] <timmywil> I'm sure there are advantages, but we've documented that we have meetings here down through the ages, and it's easily accessible for anyone curious.
[09:43:47] <markelog_> hm, that is the only reason?
[09:43:49] <timmywil> I have tried it.
[09:44:12] <timmywil> There don't seem to be enough advantages to change things, but what do other people think?
[09:44:33] <timmywil> markelog_: that seems like a pretty good reason to me
[09:44:50] <markelog_> we still can document the logs
[09:45:00] <m_gol> I haven't tried it too much but I think we e.g. should keep our logs on our site as we do now so this would require exporting logs etc., seems like it'd require some work
[09:45:18] <markelog_> i would suggest to make a test meeting
[09:45:24] <markelog_> m_gol: can do that
[09:46:04] <markelog_> would want to see ga stats on that page first though
[09:46:08] <timmywil> It's not just about logs. Easy access to the meeting is important.
[09:46:36] <markelog_> gitter is super easy to access
[09:46:44] <m_gol> a lot of these solutions have recently emerged; at work I use HipChat, for Angular we use Slack, for jQuery IRC and we're talking Gitter now... it's moving fast :P
[09:46:47] <timmywil> it is, however, tied to github
[09:47:36] <markelog_> it seems you are searching for reasons not to :-)
[09:47:46] <markelog_> is that really could be an issue?
[09:48:08] <timmywil> well, we would be saying you need a github account to attend the meeting
[09:48:31] <markelog_> github handle is very easy to create
[09:48:44] <markelog_> as we see by the spam peple
[09:48:51] <markelog_> also
[09:49:13] <markelog_> if anyone is participating in the core meeting
[09:49:25] <markelog_> it would be pretty weird their wouldn't have one
[09:49:53] <markelog_> whereas you can get access to the meeting logs
[09:50:06] <markelog_> whenever or not you have github handle
[09:50:08] <timmywil> I suppose that's true
[09:50:23] <timmywil> gibson0421: you're quiet :)
[09:50:34] <markelog_> makes some noise!!!!1!111
[09:50:44] <timmywil> if we try it, I want it to be unanimous
[09:50:44] <markelog_> )
[09:50:54] <gibson0421> I don't have a strong opinion here... IRC is fine by me, but I'm on gitter and have no problems with that either
[09:51:26] <gibson0421> it's all just realtime text
[09:51:31] <timmywil> markelog_: would you be willing to work out exporting the logs?
[09:51:36] <markelog_> yep
[09:51:45] <markelog_> but that is too far ahead
[09:51:53] <markelog_> right now i'm suggesting only to test it
[09:51:57] <markelog_> there might other issues
[09:52:06] <timmywil> we're going to need logs for the trial meeting too
[09:52:22] <markelog_> i'm the master of the copy-paste :-)
[09:52:30] <timmywil> yea, that's fine
[09:52:49] <timmywil> ok, let's do a trial meeting next week then
[09:52:54] <markelog_> cool
[09:53:30] <markelog_> we already have the https://gitter.im/jquery
[09:53:32] <markelog_> btw
[09:53:34] <timmywil> I'll still ping everyone here to let everyone know where we are
[09:54:11] <timmywil> that's it for today. Thanks everybody!
[09:54:24] <markelog_> see ya!
