[11:05:37] <gseguin> I landed that

[11:06:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2107 on jquery-mobile, reported by adriancd (2m, 4d ago): scrollSupressionThreshold - scrolling smoothness impact
[11:06:10] <toddparker> kinblas: need you opinion htere
[11:06:24] <kinblas> @toddparker: I need to look at it in detail
[11:06:33] <toddparker> sure, sure
[11:06:39] <toddparker> just wanted dot draw you attn to it
[11:06:53] <toddparker> if it is causing slowness, it's worth re-thinking for 10
[11:06:55] <toddparker> 1.0
[11:06:56] * kinblas throws it on the pile
[11:06:59] <toddparker> k
[11:07:03] <toddparker> burn pile?
[11:07:06] <_nickel> lol
[11:07:09] <kinblas> to-look-at
[11:07:14] <toddparker> ok, next
[11:07:15] <toddparker> Transitions blink on iPad if text input is given focus and keyboard dismissed.
[11:07:15] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2343
[11:07:16] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2343 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (3w, 6d ago): Transitions blink on iPad if text input is given focus and keyboard dismissed.
[11:07:29] <_nickel> that issue makes me sad
[11:07:32] <_nickel> so very sad
[11:07:33] <toddparker> yeah
[11:07:37] <toddparker> so odd
[11:07:58] <kinblas> so the good news is that it supposedly isn't a problem on iOS5
[11:08:03] <kinblas> though I can't confirm
[11:08:04] <toddparker> so i don't think killing focus: outline is an option
[11:08:09] <toddparker> oh good
[11:08:22] <toddparker> i don't have an iPad 2 running iOS5
[11:08:31] <gseguin> I do
[11:08:52] <toddparker> cool
[11:09:00] <kinblas> gseguin: can you try it out and let us know?
[11:09:02] <toddparker> maybe you can test and comment
[11:09:06] <toddparker> yeah ^^
[11:09:17] <gseguin> is that this url: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2500/files?

[11:09:20] <gseguin> ?
[11:09:33] <gseguin> oops wrong paste
[11:09:46] <gseguin> http://demo.netline.lu/jqueryMobile/
[11:09:49] <gseguin> right ?
[11:10:40] <toddparker> looks like it, yes
[11:10:52] * gseguin tries it out 
[11:11:02] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah
[11:11:14] <kinblas> gseguin: you have to be in portrait
[11:11:16] <toddparker> wonder if we just need to blur() form elements prior to starting a transition?
[11:11:22] <kinblas> gseguin: I meant landscape
[11:12:48] <gseguin> no blinking here
[11:12:57] <toddparker> woo hoo fixed!
[11:13:01] <toddparker> kidding
[11:13:26] <kinblas> gseguin: you clicked in the textfield, dismissed the keyboard and then did the transition?
[11:13:34] <kinblas> ... in landscape?
[11:13:39] <gseguin> kinblas: landscape
[11:13:47] <gseguin> clicked the first button
[11:13:49] <gseguin> then went back
[11:13:54] <gseguin> then clicked in the field
[11:14:12] <gseguin> then hit the last button (without dismissing the keyboard)
[11:14:49] <gseguin> I just tried with the dismissing the keyboard step
[11:14:50] <gseguin> it
[11:14:57] <gseguin> is working as well
[11:15:19] <kinblas> gseguin: toddparker: ok that jives with what I heard
[11:15:48] <gseguin> :D
[11:15:55] <kinblas> toddparker: so we can try the blur thing, which I thought we were already doing
[11:16:05] <toddparker> i was just checking on our iPad running 43.
[11:16:11] <toddparker> we might be
[11:16:17] <toddparker> blurring, that is
[11:16:30] <toddparker> also, this issues was flagged as a dupe of this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2399
[11:16:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2399 on jquery-mobile, reported by kfrancis (2w, 22h ago): Transitions slowed down significantly on iPad when in horizontal orientation
[11:16:31] <gseguin> is that blurring in the vclick handler ?
[11:16:32] <toddparker> close it?
[11:16:55] <gseguin> kinblas: ^^^
[11:17:26] <toddparker> boy, that is ugly
[11:17:31] <kinblas> toddparker: no can't close
[11:18:28] <toddparker> it a bit different, right
[11:18:32] <toddparker> leaving open
[11:18:52] <kinblas> gseguin: I see that we are indeed blurring:
[11:18:53] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1017
[11:19:20] <kinblas> and we *ARE* blurring before the transition
[11:19:25] <toddparker> on my iPad, if i dismiss the keyboard or click out to manually blur, it's still a mess
[11:19:34] <toddparker> it's like the keyboard kills the buffer
[11:20:16] <_nickel> something has gone really wrong with the testsuite
[11:21:06] <kinblas> _nickel: ??
[11:21:14] * kinblas fires off unit tests
[11:21:34] <_nickel> kinblas: eddiemonge: the changes you made to the php for some reason are breaking the build and my local server
[11:21:38] <toddparker> alright, well we know that it's better in iOS5 anyway. I just commented
[11:21:51] <toddparker> yikes _nickel
[11:21:59] <gseguin> ouch!
[11:22:01] <eddiemonge> _nickel: can you see what the error is?
[11:22:10] <_nickel> eddiemonge: looking
[11:23:05] <_nickel> eddiemonge: chrome shows me "failed to load resource /js"
[11:23:15] <_nickel> checking the logs
[11:23:41] <kinblas> _nickel: we've had to make sure that there was a trailing slash behind the /js/
[11:23:43] <kinblas> in the past
[11:23:54] <kinblas> are we not doing that in some file?
[11:24:28] <_nickel> not sure
[11:25:16] <_nickel> eddiemonge: my message to you sounds very curt and accusatory, sorry man thats not cool
[11:25:19] <_nickel> I'm sure its something lame
[11:25:40] <eddiemonge> i didnt take it like that.
[11:25:48] <eddiemonge> im curious though why it would be failing
[11:25:52] <_nickel> same
[11:26:11] <toddparker> alright, you guys can dig into this in a bit?

[11:30:59] <toddparker> gseguin - you didn't push the collapsible stuff yet, did you?
[11:31:17] <gseguin> nope, was hoping to write some tests first
[11:31:25] <toddparker> k, k
[11:31:33] <toddparker> moving on...
[11:31:33] <gseguin> and then that big old mess with the core tests failing showed up
[11:31:42] <toddparker> yep

[11:31:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1880 on jquery-mobile, reported by gseguin (3m, 1d ago): Provide a user friendly method to set global options
[11:33:07] <toddparker> if this isn't an easy tweak, i'm inclined to move this down to low priority
[11:33:14] <toddparker> or as a feature request
[11:33:20] <gseguin> I think that's fair
[11:33:23] <toddparker> for post 1.-
[11:33:45] <toddparker> _nickel, kinblas?
[11:34:28] <kinblas> +1 on the priority shift

[11:35:18] <kinblas> toddparker: not sure it's not all the time
[11:35:30] <kinblas> toddparker: I'll look into it
[11:35:37] <kinblas> I think it's assigned to me already
[11:35:46] <kinblas> that bug has morphed in terms of what the bug is
[11:35:52] <kinblas> because folks keep chiming in
[11:36:05] <toddparker> yeah, it's epic
[11:36:31] <toddparker> do we need to make a new ticket?
[11:36:33] <toddparker> close this?
[11:36:37] <_nickel> toddparker: I'm with the move to post 1.0 on the user friendly global options
[11:36:49] <kinblas> toddparker: ideally the guy would've filed his own issue
[11:36:51] <toddparker> thanks _ni
[11:37:04] <kinblas> I believe it was originally about custom select events over text inputs
[11:37:05] <toddparker> jebw?
[11:37:19] <kinblas> toddparker: the select problem is fixed already
[11:37:22] <toddparker> is the original issue addressed as much as it can be really?
[11:37:26] <toddparker> yeah
[11:37:29] <kinblas> toddparker: now the bug is talking about listview items under footers
[11:37:50] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah the original issue isn't reproducible as far as I'm concerned
[11:37:55] <toddparker> ok
[11:38:04] <toddparker> so i'll close and move that into a new issue
[11:38:31] <kinblas> toddparker: sure, just make sure it's assigned to me?
[11:38:42] <kinblas> I'd like to try and figure the listview/footer issue for 1.0
[11:38:55] <toddparker> ok
[11:38:59] <toddparker> what is a god title?
[11:39:01] <toddparker> good

[11:42:11] <toddparker> I thought we did some work related to this recently
[11:42:54] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah
[11:43:04] <toddparker> we did, right kinblas?
[11:43:12] * kinblas is reading the issue
[11:43:45] <toddparker> k
[11:43:52] <kinblas> he's citing old code
[11:43:56] <kinblas> this might be a non-issue now
[11:45:30] <kinblas> actually I'm pretty sure this is a non-issue now
[11:45:40] <kinblas> especially if he is specifying an absolute URL in his link
[11:45:46] <kinblas> we respect things now
[11:46:05] <kinblas> and resolve all relative links against the URL used to load the current page
[11:46:12] <kinblas> just as a browser would
[11:46:29] <toddparker> cool, commented
[11:46:32] <toddparker> asked them to test

[11:47:10] <toddparker> these are optimization suggested a while back
[11:47:20] <toddparker> just want to know how to tag 'em
[11:47:26] <toddparker> we gonna do these?
[11:47:34] <toddparker> if so, before/after 1.0
[11:49:07] <toddparker> i just have 'em as low priority
[11:49:13] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah someone should look into whether those suggestions are feesible ... things to look for are that the widget constructor code doesn't assume that the element is in the doc
[11:49:20] <kinblas> but these are perf optimizations
[11:50:34] <toddparker> so just leave them in as low for now?
[11:50:55] <kinblas> toddparker: I just meant they are perf, so I would visit them last
[11:50:58] <kinblas> if we have time
[11:51:01] <toddparker> yeah
[11:51:03] <toddparker> ok

[11:51:19] <toddparker> this seems sorta bad
[11:51:28] <toddparker> we should test that all form elements can be disabled
[11:51:33] <toddparker> i flassed as RC
[11:51:36] <gseguin> ok
[11:51:37] <toddparker> flagged
[11:51:50] <_nickel> toddparker: we have a test failure for the checkbox radio
[11:51:56] <_nickel> I'm thinking thats a recent issue
[11:52:01] <toddparker> yeah?
[11:52:11] <gseguin> I can look at it after jqmData and collapsibles
[11:52:24] <toddparker> ok, thanks gseguin
[11:52:30] <toddparker> assigned to you
[11:52:39] <toddparker> ok

[11:52:46] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #734 on jquery-mobile, reported by TZAdvantage (8m, 3w ago): Change tap event to return pageX,pageY coordinates in iOS
[11:52:48] <_nickel> hmm looks unrelated
[11:53:05] <toddparker> _nickel: what's unrelated?
[11:53:26] <_nickel> the test failure
[11:53:29] <toddparker> is that x, y a feature request?
[11:53:29] <_nickel> but it may not be
[11:53:31] <_nickel> actually
[11:53:33] <toddparker> oh, thanks _nickel
[11:54:24] <toddparker> …or is the x,y some critical thing we're not doing
[11:54:51] <kinblas> toddparker: the tap code is just changing the event type on the touchevent
[11:54:53] <kinblas> and passing it
[11:55:00] <kinblas> the x,y are actually inthe touch arrays
[11:55:38] <toddparker> so they just missed that?
[11:55:56] <kinblas> hmmm actually it's using vclick so it should be there
[11:56:04] <kinblas> is this an old bug?
[11:56:14] <toddparker> dec. 27!
[11:56:23] <gseguin> toddparker: I have to run in a few minutes
[11:56:26] <kinblas> yeah this should be fixed
[11:56:33] <toddparker> so i can close?
[11:56:43] <toddparker> ok gseguin
[11:56:44] <kinblas> it's still lame that tap is passing on the original bug disguising it as tap
[11:57:03] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah the event has pageX/Y, screenX/Y, and clientX/Y on it
[11:57:22] <toddparker> great, i'll comment and close
[11:57:42] <kinblas> yeah it got fixed when I switched tap over to vmouse events

[11:59:12] <kinblas> I think we've worked it out now
[11:59:16] <kinblas> the slash is critical
[11:59:25] <kinblas> that is, if we have a patch with no trailing slash

[12:01:57] <_nickel> ugh
[12:02:02] <_nickel> rfc spelunking
[12:02:07] <_nickel> it might be a reserve char
[12:02:32] <kinblas> _nickel: it's a problem with the monkey patch
[12:02:47] <kinblas> and how it parses what to replace with a regexp
[12:03:06] <kinblas> toddparker: but yes, we should fix it if we can
[12:03:28] <todd_> ok
[12:03:28] <kinblas> _nickel: I believe parens are allowed
[12:03:32] <todd_> medium priority ok?
[12:03:40] <todd_> not critical for 1.0?
[12:03:52] <kinblas> sure ... I guess the urgency depends on the URL scheme used by your app :-)
[12:03:58] <todd_> heh

[12:04:28] <_nickel> toddparker: closed that
[12:04:32] <todd_> _nickel: nice
[12:04:34] <_nickel> his suggestion will break it
[12:04:40] <_nickel> but we need to make that thing suck less
[12:04:44] <_nickel> its pretty naive
[12:05:16] <todd_> heh
[12:05:21] <kinblas> +1 on the sucking less
[12:05:22] <todd_> one more then

[12:06:02] <kinblas> todd_: yeah I was going to look into dispatching pagebeforeload pageload and pageloadfailed
[12:06:03] <kinblas> today
[12:06:14] <kinblas> I've been meaning to add those
[12:07:12] <kinblas> toddparker: so what's our tentative pencils down date?
[12:07:59] <kinblas> we want something on the wire by Oct 1st I'm assuming
[12:08:21] * kinblas notes that's 8 days away
[12:09:02] <toddparker> yes
[12:09:31] <toddparker> in fact, i wonder if we should shoot for the first RC near the end of next week?
[12:09:50] <kinblas> isn't that the day before jqcon?
[12:10:32] <kinblas> _nickel: what's your availability for bug fixing between now and then?
[12:10:40] <kinblas> toddparker: what's scott's availability?
[12:10:42] <toddparker> yes, yes it is
[12:10:47] <toddparker> yikes
[12:10:54] <kinblas> gseguin: availability?
[12:13:26] <kinblas> anyone? bueller?
[12:13:35] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm good until the end of this week but I'm traveling on Wed next week
[12:13:45] <_nickel> should be able to work while at rubyconf
[12:14:00] <_nickel> though I have some slide additions I need to get done too before my talk at jqcon
[12:14:33] <kinblas> _nickel: end being tomorrow? heh
[12:15:06] <_nickel> kinblas: I can work this weekend if needs be
[12:15:29] <kinblas> toddparker: so we're down at least one man ... let's make sure our must fix bugs for 1.0 are all tagged so we can just plow through them
[12:16:05] <toddparker> yeah
[12:16:21] <toddparker> this is the short list now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=8
[12:17:22] <kinblas> toddparker: so as you know adobe's MAX is coming up same time ... I'm trying to minimize distractions, but I get pulled into things here and there
[12:17:34] <toddparker> sure
[12:17:37] * kinblas tries to stay focused
[12:17:46] <toddparker> so i think we need to have an RC out next week
[12:18:02] <kinblas> toddparker: so let's shoot for pencils down thursday?
[12:18:16] <toddparker> we won't hit 1.0 for the jQ conf, but we can try to have an RC each week after
[12:18:24] <toddparker> until we think we're happy for 1.0
[12:18:26] <kinblas> that gives us ... heh you guys .. all day friday to fight fires (with my help of course)
[12:18:47] <kinblas> toddparker: what would the hold up be for declaring final 1.0?
[12:19:00] <toddparker> next week?
[12:19:04] <kinblas> in general
[12:19:17] <toddparker> when we think we've nailed any really bad issues
[12:19:34] <kinblas> toddparker: the yet to be known "really bad issues"?
[12:19:44] <toddparker> that's why i'm wondering if that list of RC items is really the ones we *need* to solve
[12:20:04] <toddparker> i think we need to have 203 RCs
[12:20:07] <toddparker> 2-3
[12:20:14] <_nickel> lol
[12:20:14] <kinblas> hmmm ok
[12:20:21] <_nickel> 203
[12:20:31] <toddparker> i don't think slapping a 1.0 on it out of the blue would be odd
[12:20:36] <kinblas> _nickel: is that http humor?
[12:21:07] <_nickel> no 203 release candidates would be hilarious
[12:21:14] <toddparker> let's keep chatting on dev
[12:21:18] <toddparker> 2-3 :)
[12:21:20] <_nickel> yah I need to grab lunch
[12:21:26] <toddparker> ok, we're good
[12:21:33] <toddparker> let's plan on talking in a few...
[12:21:34] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, I need to step out temporarily too
[12:21:39] <toddparker> alright
[12:21:44] <toddparker> when are you back kinblas
[12:21:57] <kinblas> toddparker: I can be back in 20?
[12:22:01] <toddparker> ok
[12:22:12] <kinblas> depending how long the grill guy takes :-)
[12:22:27] <toddparker> alright all, let's talk in a few
[12:22:31] <toddparker> thanks!
