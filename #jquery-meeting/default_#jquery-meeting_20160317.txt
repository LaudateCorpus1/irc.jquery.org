[14:16:59] <cogwurx> good afternoon all!
[14:17:06] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: agcolom: cogwurx: cgack: apsdehal1: meeting time late
[14:17:15] <cgack> howdy!
[14:17:16] <arschmitz> sorry was looking at prs and lost track of time
[14:17:27] <arschmitz> lots of new issues and pr's this week which is great
[14:17:29] <cogwurx> I blame daylight savings time
[14:17:34] <arschmitz> works for me
[14:18:31] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:19:48] <apsdehal1> Hi
[14:23:53] <arschmitz> ok so lets try to do this informal and quick since we are late
[14:23:58] <arschmitz> who has something to talk about
[14:24:19] <arschmitz> or has a pr needing review etc
[14:24:47] <jasperdegroot> highlight of the week is new graphic for the demos homepage by cogwurx
[14:24:49] <cogwurx> finished the new graphic for the demos homepage
[14:25:20] <jasperdegroot> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-demos-issues/demos/
[14:26:30] <jasperdegroot> rest of the homepage obviously still needs some love
[14:26:41] <jasperdegroot> especially to move the graphic up :)
[14:27:14] <gabrielschulhof> Hey! Sorry I'm late!
[14:27:28] <cogwurx> I'm all for that
[14:27:42] <cgack> arschmitz: I see you reviewed the panel transition PR, is that finished and ready for me to rework?
[14:28:04] <apsdehal1> I updated various repos for Phantom version upgrade and waiting for them to get merged
[14:28:32] <apsdehal1> I tried new version with my local clone but I am getting requirejs script errors now
[14:39:16] <arschmitz> yes
[14:39:21] <arschmitz> thats all i saw in it
[14:39:39] <arschmitz> sorry didnt add the thumbs up yet thats the one i was testing when i lost track of time lol
[14:40:02] <arschmitz> cogwurx: wow nice job
[14:40:09] <arschmitz> love the new layout and graphic
[14:41:51] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: agree needs to move up some again maybe some thing like i did before to move the content up but a nice new look
[14:42:42] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i know selectmenu is waiting on review
[14:42:57] <arschmitz> is that 100% ready with tests added and whole shebang?
[14:45:54] <gabrielschulhof> Actually, I'd wait a bit.
[14:45:57] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: i wonder if we have a dependency mixing amd and not amd like what happened with the qunit-assert-classes
[14:46:03] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ok will do
[14:46:15] <gabrielschulhof> I've just realized that those calls to .addClass()/.removeClass() may need to remain.
[14:46:20] <arschmitz> i want to get that and demos merged asap
[14:46:25] <arschmitz> and release another status blog
[14:46:35] <arschmitz> which ones where why?
[14:46:37] <gabrielschulhof> ... because we remove classes from the select upon _create() and put them back upon _destroy()
[14:47:01] <gabrielschulhof> So, we /have/ to remove them with .removeClass() and add them back with .addClass()
[14:47:12] <arschmitz> wait why are we doing that?
[14:47:17] <arschmitz> what classes?
[14:47:19] <gabrielschulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5073
[14:47:25] <gabrielschulhof> ui-button-left and ui-button-right
[14:47:43] <apsdehal1> arschmitz: There is only a change in phantom js version, I don't think it should affect that much. ui updated phantom without any changes in code.
[14:47:58] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: hrm
[14:48:03] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: I also need your eyes on my PR to tell me why the selectmenu doesn't look 100%.
[14:48:04] <cogwurx> arschmitz: Thank you
[14:48:20] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: I can probably figure it out, but it'll likely take you 100âœ• less.
[14:48:22] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: ok
[14:48:32] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Thanks!
[14:49:24] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i wonder if there is a better way to handle the select classes
[14:49:46] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I dunno ... I just wanna stay backwards compat.
[14:50:16] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: couldnt we just leave the class on the select element instead of removing it
[14:50:30] <arschmitz> and nullify its effects with css specificity
[14:50:36] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: .ui-selectmenu .ui-button > span:not(.ui-listview-item-count-bubble) { display: block; } is the issue
[14:51:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i get copying it but can we avoid removing it and putting it back?
[14:52:25] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: sorry, which class do you mean exactly?
[14:52:38] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: So, ... I just remove that?
[14:52:39] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/85fd6722be45b8685cfd1951068bdea843dc21c7
[14:52:47] <jasperdegroot> I was distracted, maybe I missed something
[14:52:54] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: here where you added copying the class from the select itself to the button
[14:52:58] <arschmitz> and then back again
[14:53:05] <arschmitz> ui-btn-left that is
[14:53:16] <arschmitz> or right
[14:53:36] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: yeah, I think we can just remove that
[14:53:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok, I am looking now
[14:54:23] <arschmitz> because classes option would be the new way to do something like this
[14:54:35] <arschmitz> dont set it on the select menu it self set the classes option
[14:54:48] <arschmitz> but for backcompat
[14:54:49] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, I think we should fix this with CSS
[14:55:05] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: great
[14:55:16] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: so i guess you have your direction to head there too
[14:55:43] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: also, we deprecated automatically adding ui-button-left/right classes in the header, right?
[14:56:10] <arschmitz> yes
[14:56:46] <jasperdegroot> so we shouldn't have JS in the widget to remove a class that people might have added
[14:57:21] <jasperdegroot> but of course we should still support that class so I will look into CSS to handle that case
[14:57:24] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: There's still an issue with custom selects. The listview is bigger than the header.
[14:58:12] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: OK. So, should I simply yank the code that removes the class upon _create() and re-adds it upon _destroy()?
[14:58:29] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: yes
[14:58:35] <cogwurx> need to head to another meeting...have a good week everyone!
[14:58:37] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Siryessir!
[14:58:42] <gabrielschulhof> cogwurx: L8R
[14:58:50] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: al your problems can be fixed with the delete key
[14:58:51] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: I will push a commit to your branch to fix it with CSS
[14:58:58] <jasperdegroot> cogwurx: laters
[14:58:58] <arschmitz> cogwurx: thank you for the work on demos
[14:59:03] <arschmitz> see you next week
[14:59:22] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: I also see that listview/header problem

[14:59:34] <arschmitz> cgack: thanks later
[14:59:38] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: L8R
[14:59:55] <jasperdegroot> later cgack
[14:59:57] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Did I do anything wrong with the classes?
