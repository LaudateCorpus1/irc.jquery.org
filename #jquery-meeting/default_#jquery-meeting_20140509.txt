[00:20:37] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[00:21:05] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: hi~
[00:21:10] <uGoMobi> hi
[00:21:12] <Minkyeong> _|Nix|_: Hi!
[00:21:15] <Kangsik> hi
[00:22:42] <_|Nix|_> So, as I was just saying: Ideally, the button style option removal PR should be accompanied by an API docs PR that deprecates the style options and documents that you can now accomplish things with the convenience classes.
[00:23:01] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Did you review Kangsik's PR-7348? I wonder if we need to fix our PR.
[00:23:46] <_|Nix|_> In fact, arschmitz has created a template for a widget review issue in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7359
[00:24:03] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Yes, right. I also want to ask the point.
[00:24:24] <_|Nix|_> We should follow that template for the style option removal and work our way through the checklist at the bottom.
[00:24:53] <_|Nix|_> ... because, for example, the demos also may need to be updated.
[00:25:25] <uGoMobi> yes
[00:25:30] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: ah..... I see...
[00:25:41] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: so the PR looks good, but we won't merge yet
[00:26:16] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. I looked at it too. Does indeed look good.
[00:26:29] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Oh, really ?
[00:27:11] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: yes, because docs and demos and tests need to be updated first
[00:27:25] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: Then, don't we need to submit the PR following new PR template?
[00:27:37] <uGoMobi> in this case probably just docs and demos
[00:27:39] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: ah. ok.
[00:27:49] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: The template will have you updating the docs and demos.
[00:28:06] <_|Nix|_> For example, on demos/button/, there's a demo where the corners are turned off. That demo should be modified to use the new convenience class.
[00:28:25] <uGoMobi> thanks for updating that PR Kangsik !
[00:28:42] <Kangsik> @uGoMobi: NP. :-)
[00:30:28] <_|Nix|_> I can edit the issue to conform to the template.
[00:30:46] <_|Nix|_> ... although I'm a bit new to this whole template thing.
[00:31:11] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: hmm... Should be a PR updating docs and demo also submit on jquery-mobile repo?
[00:31:25] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Nono. Just mention the PR number.,
[00:31:32] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: That will create a link.
[00:31:49] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Like, jquery/api.jquerymobile.com#nnnn
[00:31:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just copy from the checklist from that navbar issue
[00:32:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[00:32:39] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: demos are on the jquery-mobile repo, API docs not
[00:33:12] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Yes. I already know so. but..
[00:34:00] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: I'm sorry but, I/my team don't understand well your words.
[00:34:14] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: for example,
[00:35:17] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: In case of PR-7348, we need to sumit the updading docs and demo for Button widget on API repo.
[00:36:15] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: You can add the demos update to PR-7348
[00:36:20] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: ... then,  we need to update the URL for the API PR on PR-7348. right?
[00:37:13] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: You can add another commit to PR-7348 that updates the demos. Then, you can create a PR on jquery/api.jquerymobile.com updating the API docs.
[00:37:49] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: when creating a PR on the API docs repo to update the docs you can mention jquery/jquery-mobile#7348 in the comment
[00:38:24] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[00:38:33] <uGoMobi> just to refer to the other PR
[00:38:37] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: I got it.
[00:38:54] <uGoMobi> when all PRs are ready we merge them at same time
[00:39:59] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: OK, I see.
[00:41:55] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: But, I'm afraid that I can write/explain a guide in docs.....
[00:43:00] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: I don't understand. What is it you are you afraid of?
[00:43:06] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: due to our English ability...
[00:43:45] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: We've done API docs before. For web-ui-fw. It's quite good. If there are any problems, I can correct them.
[00:44:04] <uGoMobi> yeah, no worries
[00:44:07] <uGoMobi> we can help
[00:44:52] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: Thanks~! I think we need your help.
[00:45:00] <Hyunsook> ^^
[00:45:12] <uGoMobi> :)
[00:45:32] <_|Nix|_> http://web-ui-fw.github.io/jqm/0.2.0/api-docs/tokentextarea/
[00:45:35] <_|Nix|_> Not bad at all!
[00:46:05] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: haha~ thanks.
[00:46:24] <uGoMobi> exactly
[00:46:30] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: See? Don't worry about it! You'll be fine!
[00:47:16] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: As your advice, we'll submit new PR for demo and also submit new PR docs updating on API repo.
[00:48:00] <uGoMobi> I think we can combine code and demo in one PR
[00:48:18] <uGoMobi> only new PR for what is not in the same repo
[00:49:21] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[00:49:36] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Just add another commit to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7348 which updates the demos.
[00:52:01] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: you mean that the demo is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/demos/button. right?
[00:52:51] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Yes.
[00:53:31] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: OK, clear!
[00:54:20] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!
[00:54:28] <uGoMobi> great
[00:54:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Hyunsook : do we have anything else to discuss?
[00:54:50] <_|Nix|_> BTW: arschmitz has made some progress on providing a new home for web-ui-fw widgets.
[00:55:09] <_|Nix|_> http://uglymongrel.com/
[00:55:29] <_|Nix|_> Not much so far, but he's working on it, and I'll try to add the first of our widgets to the site.
[00:57:12] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: eh? domain name is......... haha...;;
[00:57:33] <_|Nix|_> :)
[00:58:09] <_|Nix|_> So, that's about it.
[00:58:16] <_|Nix|_> I guess we should wrap up.
[00:58:21] <uGoMobi> ok
[00:58:21] <_|Nix|_> Any other topics?
[00:58:53] <uGoMobi> don't think so
[00:59:05] <uGoMobi> have a great weekend all!
[00:59:08] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: We already told you all topics.
[00:59:26] <Hyunsook> Have a good weekend~!
[00:59:40] <_|Nix|_> Alright. In that case, have a great weekend! Looking forward to next week. Shall we still meet on Tuesday?
[00:59:56] <uGoMobi> sure
[01:00:03] <Hyunsook> Sure
[01:00:14] <uGoMobi> but let's check on Monday if there any topics
[01:00:14] <_|Nix|_> Alright, then let's aim for Tuesday.
[01:00:19] <_|Nix|_> OK.
