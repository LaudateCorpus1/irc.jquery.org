[09:04:07] <rwaldron> Hi?
[09:04:58] <jaubourg> hey
[09:05:00] <gibson042> yo
[09:05:01] <Krinkle> Hi
[09:05:02] <rwaldron> Hello
[09:05:17] <rwaldron> First I'd like to say, Hi I missed you all
[09:05:25] <rwaldron> I'm now done with travelling and vacationing
[09:05:51] <gibson042> it's good to have you back
[09:05:56] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:06:00] <rwaldron> 8===D amirite?
[09:06:07] <jaubourg> sooo first item on the agenda is mergeatron
[09:06:26] <jaubourg> or is it just mergatron?
[09:06:35] <jaubourg> sounds weird to me
[09:06:46] <jaubourg> mikesherov: you around?
[09:06:52] <rwaldron> Should we have mikesherov re-iterate his email or just make sure everyone read it?
[09:06:57] <rwaldron> any questions?
[09:06:59] <mikesherov> hi
[09:07:05] <rwaldron> hi mikesherov<3
[09:07:09] <jaubourg> dunno if there is any update since then, but I suppose not?
[09:07:14] <mikesherov> rwaldron: welcome back!
[09:07:17] <jaubourg> everyone got the memo?
[09:07:30] <mikesherov> So, I was wrong about the rate-limiting, it's per hour, not per ay
[09:07:46] <mikesherov> so we probably could expand the reach now of mergeatron, but I still want to wait a bit
[09:07:49] <rwaldron> mikesherov thanks!
[09:08:24] <jaubourg> mikesherov: what are you waiting for? (just so we get an idea of the problems you're trying to tackle)
[09:09:30] <mikesherov> jaubourg: http://github.com/snapinteractive/mergeatron/issues
[09:10:08] <jaubourg> OK, so you want to fix the bugs or land some enhancements too before going full steam?
[09:10:43] <mikesherov> both
[09:10:47] <jaubourg> rwaldron: thanks for typing in the doc, not sure I have the rights to do so
[09:10:57] <mikesherov> and mainly, get gnarf to back it with supervisor and puppet
[09:11:04] <Krinkle> I'd like to simplify the code needed in grunt.js to submit with testswarm, primarily to phase out the job name into an env variable or grunt option.
[09:11:25] <Krinkle> So that we don't need mergatron specific code in the grunt.js file in each repo
[09:11:39] <jaubourg> mikesherov: so all the issues you linked us to you want covered + work with gnarf
[09:11:52] <jaubourg> Krinkle: grunt-mergatron?
[09:11:59] <Krinkle> no, grunt-testswarm
[09:12:12] <jaubourg> ok
[09:12:14] <Krinkle> there is no mergatron specific logic, or rather, there shouldn't be
[09:12:21] <Krinkle> I don't want to centralise it, but rather eliminate it
[09:12:27] <jaubourg> got you
[09:12:34] <mikesherov> jaubourg: not all of the features
[09:12:37] <Krinkle> and to have it submit tests to a different testswarm account, not the primary account for each project, right not it messes up the testswarm job pages.
[09:12:45] <Krinkle> now*
[09:12:45] <mikesherov> jaubourg: if you're looking for an exact set of blockers
[09:12:56] <Krinkle> e.g. swarm.jquery.org/user/mergatron
[09:13:04] <Krinkle> (easy to do, I'll do it later this week)
[09:13:19] <jaubourg> Krinkle: got you, seems to make a lot of sense :)
[09:13:23] <Krinkle> Can someone grant me access to edit the doc? (krinklemail@gmail.com, same as mailinglist)
[09:13:45] <jaubourg> I guess rwaldron can, let me check the rights (or lack of) I have myself
[09:14:18] <jaubourg> haha, I cannot even edit >< me and my gmail account not being my main email :/
[09:14:32] <mikesherov> so jaubourg, the blockers are really just time, and infra at the moment
[09:14:51] <mikesherov> It's fine as it is. I'd like to just wait one more week
[09:15:00] <jaubourg> mikesherov: ok, so coming week for Krinkle, same for you?
[09:15:08] <mikesherov> yes
[09:15:09] <jaubourg> sounds awesomely close :) \o/
[09:15:09] <rwaldron> Krinkle all set
[09:15:14] <Krinkle> k
[09:15:17] <Krinkle> yes
[09:15:32] <jaubourg> rwaldron: if you can add julian@creative-area.net that would be awesome too ;)
[09:16:04] <jaubourg> ok, mergatron covered... next is 1.9 beta
[09:16:23] <rwaldron> jaubourg all set
[09:16:28] <jaubourg> thanks :)
[09:17:24] <mikesherov> so, 1.9 has been a lower priority for me than UI for the past month or so
[09:17:25] <rwaldron> np
[09:17:46] <jaubourg> soooo, 1.9 beta... so we still have things of importance that have no-one assigned is what I'm more concerned about
[09:17:51] <mikesherov> I purposely took on less responsibility though. All I'm going after is some decent speed increases in .css(), and an array signature for it
[09:17:59] <jaubourg> mikesherov: I was globe-trotting myself so no biggy
[09:19:11] <mikesherov> but we did this on jquery-ui: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=200 so that's where I've been
[09:19:17] <jaubourg> gibson042: you probably know more about me regarding the status of 1.9
[09:19:24] <rwaldron> jaubourg ijust grabbed 2 that seem easily killable or patchable
[09:19:29] <rwaldron> I'll know more shortly
[09:19:35] <jaubourg> rwaldron: thanks
[09:19:38] <mikesherov> link to the 1.9 tixx?
[09:19:52] <rwaldron> mikesherov 1.9 unassigned http://bugs.jquery.com/query?owner=&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.9&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=changetime&report=506&order=owner
[09:20:20] <gibson042> IIRC, there's not very much that has to land but no one has claimed
[09:20:28] <mikesherov> so, I would take see ?12886
[09:20:29] <jaubourg> ok, good
[09:20:35] <mikesherov> ?see 12886
[09:20:36] <rwaldron> migrating content from one format to another seems awful
[09:20:39] <mikesherov> ?12886
[09:20:44] <mikesherov> :-\
[09:20:45] <bot-t> so, Ticket #12886 - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 3 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12886
[09:20:46] <bot-t> mikesherov, Ticket #12886 - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 3 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12886
[09:20:47] <bot-t> [#12886] Add source map support for build (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/12886
[09:21:24] <mikesherov> I would take that, but really that ticket should be: upgrade to Grunt 0.4, and then add source maps via grunt-contrib-uglify
[09:22:04] <jaubourg> hmmm, seems there are tickets in Deferreds I don't agree with... :P
[09:22:17] <mikesherov> So it's blocked by grunt's release, which is only blocked by docs right now: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/549
[09:22:23] <jaubourg> mikesherov: the easiest, the better
[09:22:38] <jaubourg> it's not like it's *that* urgent or something
[09:22:56] <rwaldron> jaubourg tickets you dont agree with?
[09:22:58] <rwaldron> no. way.
[09:23:01] <rwaldron> ;)
[09:23:05] <mikesherov> these are all pretty low priority
[09:23:23] <jaubourg> rwaldron: yeah, never happens right?
[09:23:36] <mikesherov> I mean, I could take "Move the Style Guide into our repository" and "format all code in unit tests to conform to the style guide"
[09:24:11] <mikesherov> or even, test again CSP
[09:24:12] <jaubourg> mikesherov: I don't want you to take too much work especially if you need time for mergatron
[09:24:19] <mikesherov> jaubourg: k
[09:24:23] <mikesherov> I'll back off then
[09:24:38] <jaubourg> I mean, you can, but we want you to sleep at some time or another ;)
[09:24:57] <Krinkle> nice, gruntjs 0.4 closing in
[09:24:59] <Krinkle> Can't wait :)
[09:25:09] <mikesherov> Krinkle: it works.
[09:25:14] <mikesherov> just really needs docs
[09:25:16] <jaubourg> non-essential tickets, I'm not too anxious about, we're talking early beta here
[09:25:23] <mikesherov> but I don't want to jump the gun
[09:25:28] <gibson042> I don't see anything critical in http://bugs.jquery.com/query?owner=&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.9&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=changetime&report=506&order=owner , and honestly the Deferred & Manipulation bugs should probably be wontfix'd
[09:25:44] <jaubourg> I think we should land what's backward compatibility breaking and then release the beta
[09:25:46] <gibson042> the rest are build & test tasks
[09:25:47] <mikesherov> mergeatron uses 0.4: https://github.com/SnapInteractive/mergeatron/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
[09:25:56] <Krinkle> ok
[09:26:03] <jaubourg> gibson042: that's what I think too
[09:26:21] <rwaldron> build and test tasks: I love this.
[09:26:38] <gibson042> so, looking at assigned tickets for breaking changes still in need of landing
[09:26:39] <gibson042> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&group=owner&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=milestone&col=changetime&report=506&order=priority
[09:26:50] <jaubourg> yeah, FYI, I'm still working on the ajax unit tests and limited the number of php scripts to 3 so far and I don't think i'll add much more
[09:27:00] <mikesherov> OK, so I gotta run gents
[09:27:01] <jaubourg> more logic client-side makes for better unit tests overall
[09:27:17] <mikesherov> seems like we're doing alright, I'll take those other tasks if I get free time, but no promises
[09:27:20] <mikesherov> later!
[09:27:54] <jaubourg> cya mike :)

[09:28:28] <rwaldron> ugh
[09:28:38] <rwaldron> 12838 is ridiculous
[09:29:05] <rwaldron> This is the sort of thing that we probably wouldn't have entertained a year ago
[09:29:05] <gibson042> tell it to jaubourg :P
[09:29:24] <jaubourg> :P
[09:29:51] <rwaldron> I had a long response to that thread on the PR comments
[09:30:15] <rwaldron> basically, I think we should just eliminate the hard dependency on ajax
[09:30:40] <jaubourg> well, the right solution would probably be to remove support for script tag execution in html fragment, but we would probably have the whole internet chasing us for blood
[09:30:56] <gibson042> yeah, that cat's out of the bag
[09:31:05] <rwaldron> or just define a localized script evaluation function?
[09:31:38] <jaubourg> well, I won't get into it more because it's a general meeting, but if we have a hook, it should be close to where it's used... now I won't say more :P
[09:31:40] <gibson042> we'd still want the transport code that's in ajax
[09:32:04] <rwaldron> Exposing _more_ api on jQuery is not the answer to any of our problems
[09:32:22] <jaubourg> the crux of the problem is that executing scripts in html fragments was a bad idea to begin with
[09:32:34] <rwaldron> agreed
[09:32:36] <jaubourg> so anything we do from now will be clunky at best
[09:32:38] <rwaldron> but we can't undo that.
[09:33:13] <jaubourg> I laid out my own arguments in the bug tracker and in the PR. But thing is, there is definitely no consensus here.
[09:33:24] <jaubourg> lay out your arguments too rick
[09:33:35] <rwaldron> meh.
[09:33:51] <jaubourg> meh yourself :P
[09:34:18] <jaubourg> you're back from travelling so now you have to write stuff down... you can add hollidays photos to make your point if you want :P
[09:34:19] <rwaldron> damn, I closed that tab and the line comment is gone
[09:34:23] <rwaldron> I don't want to retype
[09:34:46] <rwaldron> summary: no new api. decouple with a localized script evaluation mechanism
[09:34:59] <jaubourg> anyway, moving on because the discussion regarding this specific bug won't stop in the coming half hour.
[09:35:06] <rwaldron> +1
[09:35:56] <jaubourg> so people, have a look at https://docs.google.com/a/creative-area.net/document/d/1rYH6C10gOl0q5iQTxBcAGcS4ZAlt7tuFs3psHHnxJdk/edit#heading=h.8fpe85x0x8wa and complete as you see fit... I'll take some time tonight to do so myself... if I have the rights to do so
[09:38:05] <gibson042> is timmywil around? by my count, he's got half of the tickets blocking an early beta release
[09:38:28] <jaubourg> let's try it three times
[09:38:35] <jaubourg> timmywil timmywil timmywil
[09:38:35] <timmywil> eek, sorry all. have a deadlien today
[09:38:43] <jaubourg> WORKED!
[09:38:53] <gibson042> kudos jaubourg
[09:39:10] <gibson042> timmywil: one of us will probably swipe them
[09:39:11] <rwaldron> now how do we get rid of him?
[09:39:13] <rwaldron> <3
[09:39:14] <jaubourg> no problem timmy, do you think you'll have time for some jQuery lovin' the coming week?
[09:39:29] <timmywil> I should be able to get it done this week yea
[09:39:41] <jaubourg>  /kiss timmywil
[09:39:49] <timmywil> gibson042: but if you have time to grab anything that's fine too
[09:40:04] <timmywil> :root, :target, etc. are super simple
[09:40:12] <gibson042> yea
[09:40:17] <jaubourg> ok, so seems we should be good regarding early beta next week
[09:40:43] <timmywil> gibson042: although root could be affected by the plans for setDocument
[09:40:43] <jaubourg> what do we have in the PR queue we can merge, what so we have we should close?
[09:42:12] <jaubourg> I'd say let's merge this document fragment removal thingy
[09:43:02] <gibson042> hear hear
[09:43:03] <jaubourg> anybody knows if Krinkle's jshint PR still needs to be rebased? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1043
[09:43:09] <rwaldron> jaubourg +1
[09:43:18] <rwaldron> that's a nice chunk of junk to drop
[09:43:57] <jaubourg> other than that, I'm not knowledgeable enough to take decisions, but people shouldn't hesistate to close or merge PRs in their area of expertise
[09:43:59] <gibson042> jaubourg: it does, but can just be handled with git tricks
[09:44:19] <jaubourg> gibson042: I'm no good at those :/
[09:44:45] <gibson042> I'll try
[09:45:12] <jaubourg> thanks, I'm so sorry I suck so much at git :/
[09:45:48] <jaubourg> sooo, oldest PR is 3 months old, probably a sign it won't be merged as is... but I think we should wait for Dave to see what his opinion is on these
[09:45:48] <gibson042> jaubourg: me too, but what's the worst that could happen? >:)
[09:46:07] <jaubourg> gibson042: breaking the interweb? Already done... twice
[09:46:24] <gibson042> other than that, let's try to update ticket priorities and get ready for 1.9
[09:47:34] <jaubourg> +1
[09:47:53] <jaubourg> I think that's a wrap for the meeting, unless someone has something critical to say?
[09:48:04] <rwaldron> Critical.
[09:48:06] <rwaldron> <3
[09:48:24] <jaubourg> haha
[09:48:47] <jaubourg> ok guys, have a good one and see you next Monday for a beta release ;)
[09:49:20] <jaubourg> whoever can should +q the channel now ;)
[09:49:37] <jaubourg> or +m, never know which
