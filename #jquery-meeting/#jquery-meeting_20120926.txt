[08:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone! I've got working wifi! (for now)
[09:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer gnarf kborchers rxaviers
[09:02:14] * rxaviers here
[09:02:15] <kborchers> yo
[09:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> nacin1 landed an update in web-base-template to support subdirectory sites.
[09:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> That gives us support for api.jqueryui.com/1.8/
[09:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> But resources won't work with that right now, since the resources are tied to the domain.
[09:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to figure out how to get that working.
[09:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> Once resources are working, I should be able to stage the 1.8 docs.
[09:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf will also need a script to listen for the updates.
[09:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: How's TR coming along?
[09:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> Is everything merged in to master now?
[09:07:30] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yes. Everything done so far is on master.
[09:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> So what's left?
[09:08:13] <rxaviers> Now, we have theme gallery images cached, all FIXME fixed, some layout bugs fixed
[09:08:43] <rxaviers> from out list, we have nothing left. Except finish checking all trac bug list
[09:09:00] <rxaviers> I've checked all themeRoller major bugs (which were 2) and it's fixed
[09:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:09:10] <rxaviers> I'm checking the other ones, which were marked as minor
[09:09:33] <rxaviers> I will present a complete list of what I did
[09:09:44] <rxaviers> BUt, Im still working on it
[09:09:54] <rxaviers> I also need to look previous download builder bugs
[09:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> I fleshed out jqueryui.com. Finished the homepage, added development and support pages.
[09:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> Did a first pass at the changelog.
[09:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> The changelog won't be complete until we do the actual release.
[09:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> Which looks like it will be next week :-)
[09:11:54] <kborchers> \o/
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers finished reviewing demos and visual tests
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> There are no outstanding issues from that :-)
[09:13:21] <kborchers> unless someone has a local IE6 they can test as i kind of assumed stuff that looked weird animation wise was lag on browserstack
[09:13:41] <kborchers> there were some weird css/layout things in IE6 too but were there in 1-8-stable too so let it go
[09:13:59] <kborchers> and not with the widgets themselves but with the examples so no big deal
[09:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, any bugs that aren't regressions are low priority.
[09:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> I would like to fix this for 1.9: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6757
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to delete that line from the CSS.
[09:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> My last comment was "This needs to wait on feedback from the design team."
[09:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> And that's 17 months old.
[09:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> At this point we don't have a design team any more.
[09:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to removing that?
[09:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'll take silence to mean no objections :-)
[09:17:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not from me other than do you think we'll have weird outlines on inputs?
[09:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think we'll have normal outlines on inputs :-P
[09:18:12] <kborchers> yeah â€¦ i guess i'm ok with that. we may need to revisit when everyone is like wtf are these outlines now :P
[09:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly I'm not even seeing a differnce when the rule is there and when it isn't.
[09:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> For example, looking at the spinner demo, I get an outline on the text field in Chrome regardless.
[09:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> And in Firefox I don't get an outline even when I delete the rule (not sure why)
[09:19:43] <kborchers> meh, kill it
[09:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll land that fix.
[09:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's really anything else to do in terms on code.
[09:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone has time before the release, reviewing the new sites would probably be the best.
[09:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to improve designs, change around content, whatever.
[09:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else before we end the meeting?
[09:30:28] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez,
[09:31:11] <rxaviers> so, my plan is to finish that remaning stuff (check bug list, and improve log msgs) of download builder and themeroller
[09:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sounds like a good plan.
[09:31:47] <rxaviers> do you want me to work in the above. or is anything else you want me to work on
[09:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> What's mentioned above sounds good.
[09:33:17] <rxaviers> ok thks
