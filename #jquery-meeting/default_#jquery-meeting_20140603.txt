[01:01:32] <_|Nix|_> Hey all!
[01:01:43] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[01:04:09] <Kangsik> Hi ~ :-)
[01:04:15] <Minkyeong> hi
[01:04:21] <Hyunsook> Hi~
[01:04:57] <uGoMobi> hi all
[01:05:13] <_|Nix|_> This is the weekly web-ui-fw meeting.
[01:05:20] <_|Nix|_> How's it going, everybody?
[01:05:52] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: Changsuk calls to another meeting, so he cannot attend our meeting, I guess.
[01:06:02] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:06:50] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook, Kangsik, Minkyeong: Cool news about the Samsung Z. Our stuff is in there!
[01:07:36] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Aha~! Really?
[01:07:55] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Well, isn't it? It's Tizen, right, so web-ui-fw is most likely in there, right?
[01:08:19] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Part of the SDK 'n all that.
[01:08:35] <uGoMobi> nice
[01:08:48] <Kangsik> I have a question. I saw that 1-5 branch was created in api.jquerymobile. Should I register new PR?
[01:09:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess 1-5 has all the 1.5.0-related changes, right?
[01:09:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it will have
[01:10:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... whereas master will remain 1.4.x?
[01:10:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[01:10:25] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Then yes, you wanna write your PR against 1-5.
[01:11:04] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Yep. thanks. :-)
[01:11:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Kangsik can just rebase and then open a new PR, right?
[01:11:36] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[01:11:46] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Please close my old PR(https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/308)
[01:11:48] <_|Nix|_> Does 1-5 even diverge from master at all, at this point?
[01:12:11] <Kangsik> uGoMobi: Yes. right.
[01:13:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, actually it doesn't
[01:13:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's OK though, because, even if they coincide, and keep coinciding for a while longer, we now have the freedom to diverge them anytime.
[01:14:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but we mast remember to cherry-pick from master to 1-5 whatever 1.4.x-related changes will survive into 1.5.0.
[01:14:23] <_|Nix|_> s/mast/must/
[01:14:30] <uGoMobi> yup
[01:16:56] <_|Nix|_> Any news from the other widgets, in terms of style option removal?
[01:17:27] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Ah. Kangsik changed the commits for jQM PR-7348 for Button to two commits.
[01:17:55] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: ... Can you check the PR? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348
[01:18:51] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: That's cool, but I think the component is Button, even for Demos. Right, uGoMobi?
[01:18:54] <uGoMobi> ok, thanks
[01:19:00] <uGoMobi> I was about to type that
[01:19:04] <_|Nix|_> :)
[01:19:09] <uGoMobi> Button --> Theme
[01:19:14] <uGoMobi> Demos --> Button
[01:19:26] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see.
[01:19:58] <uGoMobi> The first adds a global class to theme.css
[01:20:08] <uGoMobi> first commit
[01:20:09] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I guess that /does/ make it "Theme:
[01:20:12] <uGoMobi> it's not only for button
[01:20:17] <_|Nix|_> That's true.
[01:22:43] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook, Kangsik, Minkyeong: Have you had a chance to look into checkboxradio yet?
[01:22:49] <Kangsik> @uGoMobi: Should I change a commit title?
[01:23:17] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Yes, please!
[01:23:25] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: yeah, would be nice
[01:24:04] <Kangsik> @uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: Yep.. I will change it. :-)
[01:24:34] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Excellent! Thanks!
[01:24:40] <uGoMobi> thanks
[01:24:45] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: hmmm....I heard we need to changes codes for checkboxradio
[01:25:19] <_|Nix|_> Oh, really?
[01:25:27] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Can you point me to the line?
[01:25:57] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: .... We just need to Doc and Demo for checkboxradio and you can do the task for Doc and demo....
[01:26:28] <uGoMobi> no code changes, right?
[01:26:55] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: I don't understand.
[01:27:29] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Can checkboxradio not be handled via data-wrapper-class just like button?
[01:27:53] <_|Nix|_> Wait a second ...
[01:28:02] <_|Nix|_> There may be a problem with checkboxradio.
[01:28:34] <_|Nix|_> I've tried to do this: <label>Checkbox<input type="checkbox" data-wrapper-class="ui-mini"></label> and I didn't get a mini checkbox.
[01:28:41] <_|Nix|_> Lemme see if I was dreaming.
[01:29:19] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately, I wasn't: http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/483/edit :/
[01:29:47] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: I'm sorry, I didnot chack the meeting log. I just heard the discussion result from Kangsik and Changsuk.
[01:30:15] <_|Nix|_> IINM, checkboxradio removes the ui-mini class, because the mini option is set to false, even if the data-wrapper-class specifies that the ui-mini class be added.
[01:31:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[01:31:25] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: So, my team is reviewing the Collapsible since yesderday.
[01:31:28] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, so the problem is that wrapperClass is used when the button is created, but _setOptions() later removes the class ui-mini added during _wrapper()
[01:31:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also if you don't wrap the input with the label http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/484/edit
[01:31:53] <_|Nix|_> Code changes may be needed for the checkboxradio.
[01:32:14] <uGoMobi> is there a ticket already for the checkboxradio widget?
[01:32:29] <_|Nix|_> Not that I'm aware of.
[01:33:25] <_|Nix|_> I can open a ticket and mention this problem.
[01:33:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[01:34:09] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: thanks for starting to look at collapsible
[01:34:18] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: I suggest we first finish checkboxradio
[01:34:27] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: NP.
[01:34:56] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Ok, I see.
[01:36:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to add a checklist to the style options removal tickets
[01:38:48] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7463
[01:39:01] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Then... will _|Nix|_ check and commit new PR for checkboxradio? Or my team?
[01:39:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[01:39:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we use tag "widget review" when we are going to review/rewrite a whole widget
[01:39:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a tag "style options removal"
[01:40:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, sorry!
[01:40:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll change it
[01:40:10] <uGoMobi> np
[01:40:18] <_|Nix|_> Boom!
[01:40:30] <_|Nix|_> fix√©
[01:40:36] <uGoMobi> new PR?
[01:40:48] <uGoMobi> is there already a PR for checkboxradio?
[01:40:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think Hyunsook is asking whether I can handle checkboxradio style option removal.
[01:40:54] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: I'm sorry that I didn't understand well.
[01:41:01] <uGoMobi> I thought it would be added to the first PR (for button)
[01:41:05] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Do you want me to do checkboxradio?
[01:41:16] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: it's ok, no worries
[01:41:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I was just confused by "new"
[01:42:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can pull Kangsik's PR into a branch and then add the checkboxradio changes to it.
[01:42:15] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:42:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually there was a ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7430
[01:42:36] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: I think, it's better that _|Nix|_ handle the task for checkboxradio.
[01:42:49] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: ok
[01:43:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll close that ticket, because I made the comment in the other ticket.
[01:43:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: perfect
[01:44:29] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: OK, I'll do checkboxradio.
[01:44:30] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: Thanks for your understanding.
[01:44:45] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_:  Cool~!
[01:45:08] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_:Thank you. :-)
[01:45:15] <_|Nix|_> Don't worry about it!
[01:45:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll change the title because we are deprecating, not removing
[01:45:27] * _|Nix|_ blushes
[01:45:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point!
[01:47:08] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: ^^
[01:49:44] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: : _|Nix|_ will pull Kangsik's PR into a branch on the jquery-mobile repo. You and your team can create a PR against that new branch for collapsible
[01:50:35] <uGoMobi> because the changes in the theme CSS are needed for collapsible as well
[01:50:40] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: OK~
[01:50:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, Kangsik: Actually, it might be better if Kangsik rebased his PR onto a newly created branch called style-option-deprecation, which I just created.
[01:51:12] <_|Nix|_> Then, I'll make a PR against style-option-deprecation as well, for checkboxradio.
[01:51:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, sounds good
[01:51:43] <_|Nix|_> Eventually, we'll land all style option deprecation PRs against that branch, and then we'll make a PR for merging that branch.
[01:51:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good plan
[01:52:24] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Can you please rebase https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7348 against branch "style-option-deprecation"?
[01:53:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another advantage of this approach is that I can pull Kangsik's changes into the branch without needing a second PR.
[01:53:41] <_|Nix|_> ... if needed.
[01:53:47] <uGoMobi> yup
[01:54:04] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Kangsik rebase the PR-7348 and then, the PR is closed and he should submit new PR, right?
[01:54:28] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Yeah, exactly. It's the same procedure as with the API docs.
[01:54:44] <_|Nix|_> In fact, I'll close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7348.
[01:54:52] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: OK~
[01:55:01] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:55:58] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Welcome!
[01:56:16] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Hi~ I'm sorry that I'm so late...
[01:56:22] <uGoMobi> hi Changsuk
[01:56:25] <Hyunsook> Changsuk: welcome~
[01:56:38] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: No worries! You'll be happy to know that we're making good progress!
[01:56:44] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Hi~ uGoMobi.
[01:57:32] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Really? ha ha I'm happy to get your word.
[01:57:46] <Changsuk> Hi~ Hyunsook.
[01:59:13] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi, Kangsik : Kangsik will submit new PR instead of the PR-7348 will be closed. Kangsik, right?
[01:59:15] <Changsuk> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_, Hyunsook: It seems that today meeting is closing... right?
[01:59:59] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: That depends on whether we run out of topics ;)
[02:00:22] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: ah~ OK~
[02:01:05] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: yes
[02:01:08] <Kangsik> Yes.
[02:01:42] <Hyunsook> Good~!
[02:02:55] <Hyunsook> Then, my team told you all topics, I think. Do you have other topics or news?
[02:03:23] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: Then, my team told you all topics, I think. Do you have other topics or news?
[02:03:43] <_|Nix|_> Nope. 1.4.3 is well on its way. 1.5.0 is picking up. IOW, chugging along nicely.
[02:03:56] <_|Nix|_> I think we're good for next week.
[02:03:59] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: no, I think we discussed all
[02:04:03] <uGoMobi> great
[02:04:13] <uGoMobi> thanks a lot all!
[02:04:25] <uGoMobi> have a good week
[02:04:27] <_|Nix|_> Yep, have a good week, and an even better weekend after that!
[02:04:40] <Hyunsook> Good!
[02:05:04] <Hyunsook> Have a nice week and weekend!
[02:05:15] <Changsuk> All: I'm sorry again. and Have such a nice week~! ;)
[02:05:29] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Don't worry about it! Enjoy!
[02:05:39] <Hyunsook> Changsuk: ^^
[02:05:50] <Minkyeong> see y'all next week :-)
