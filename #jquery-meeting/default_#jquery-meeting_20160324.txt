[12:00:36] <bethge> Hi
[12:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry about last week. I was traveling and thought arschmitz was going to run the meeting, but I don't think I ever actually asked him to do that; I just told him I wouldn't be around.
[12:02:32] <bethge> no worries :)
[12:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> The PR to make `gotpointercapture` and `lostpointercapture` events actual `PointerEvent`s landed.
[12:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/271
[12:04:57] <bethge> Go test coverage \o/
[12:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> How's the work on pointerenter and pointerleave going?
[12:05:48] <bethge> It is ready for another review
[12:06:00] <bethge> darn, the wip ...
[12:06:07] <bethge> sorry about that
[12:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ok
[12:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> I think I can actually wind down a bit at work next week, so hopefully I'll be able to review that and get some other stuff done.
[12:08:25] <scott_gonzalez> I did dig into the tests from jdalton and I think I'm going to just pick out the tests that actually run and land those.
[12:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can come back to the others later.
[12:08:43] <bethge> Ok great
[12:10:51] <bethge> What would you say is the next item we should aim for?
[12:11:07] <bethge> as in what should I try to tackle ;)
[12:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> Could prod the WG about https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/254
[12:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> Or look into https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/235
[12:15:47] <bethge> Ok nice, sounds good
[12:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery UI 1.12.0 should ship soon. Once it does, I'll dig into using PEP in place of mouse events for interactions.
[12:20:55] <bethge> jzaefferer and I somewhat got started on this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611
[12:21:22] <bethge> Iirc the main issue are the tests
[12:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's what I'll be looking at.
[12:23:42] <bethge> It would certainly be a great step forward towards the adoption of pointer events
[12:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, if we can get that into 1.13.0, it'd be a huge help.
[12:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> Our Travis build is failing saying that we're providing an invalid key for BrowserStack.
[12:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> But I've reset the env vars twice and no luck.
[12:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see if I can get snover to help with that.
[12:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[12:28:15] <bethge> That's all from my side
[12:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, thanks.
[12:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> UnknownError: [POST http://(redacted)@hub.browserstack.com:4444/wd/hub/session / {"desiredCapabilities":{"browserName":"firefox","version":"34","browserstack.local":"true","browserstack.localIdentifier":"1458837062344","name":"tests/intern","idle-timeout":60}}] Invalid username or password
[12:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting the error locally too.
[12:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> So it's probably not a Travis issue.
[12:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep digging into this.
[12:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> If I find anything, I'll comment in #pep.
[14:01:29] <arschmitz> apsdehal: cgack: agcolom: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: sfrisk: meeting time
[14:01:34] <sfrisk> allo!
[14:01:43] <apsdehal> Hello
[14:01:49] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:02:20] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=972914042
[14:03:56] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:04:27] <arschmitz> so i wanted to start with the demo bootstrap
[14:04:58] <arschmitz> and figure out timing on landing that with table and selectmenu
[14:05:29] <arschmitz> but neither cgack nor gabrielschulhof appear to be hear ( cgack told me he would not be hes double booked )
[14:05:53] <arschmitz> but table apsdehal is going to try to add into bootstrap to see if it helps
[14:06:05] <arschmitz> and its ready aside from that so we can land those together
[14:06:22] <arschmitz> so i guess we just need to hear gabrielschulhof thoughts since selectmenu is pretty much ready too
[14:07:46] <arschmitz> i reviewed the ( incredibly large ) boot strap pr this morning
[14:07:53] <arschmitz> and it looks good aside from some style nits
[14:08:19] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: how are demos going?
[14:08:34] <apsdehal> Do you want me to put up a PR with jscs fix for all of the files except table and selectmenu?
[14:08:46] <jasperdegroot> we had some progress due to the help of apsdehal
[14:08:59] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:09:07] <arschmitz> did the test issue get fixed?
[14:09:36] <jasperdegroot> I really hope to have some time soon to fix some more issues that are on the list in the ticket
[14:09:43] <jasperdegroot> no, that's still a problem
[14:09:46] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: oh ok
[14:09:51] <arschmitz> oh right he did the search
[14:09:57] <jasperdegroot> I think that's only issue that is really blocking us for beta
[14:10:03] <arschmitz> ok
[14:10:08] <arschmitz> thats great
[14:10:29] <arschmitz> and hopefully table will be fixed with the phantom upgrade and bootstrap pr
[14:10:35] <arschmitz> which will leave just selectmenu
[14:10:39] <arschmitz> we are SOOOO CLOSE!!!
[14:10:50] <apsdehal> Yay!
[14:11:21] <arschmitz> we will want to get it on master and give it a couple weeks im thinking to look for problems
[14:11:25] <arschmitz> maybe even do a blog post
[14:11:32] <arschmitz> then beta
[14:11:39] <sfrisk> huzzuh!
[14:11:41] <jasperdegroot> or make it an alpha
[14:11:45] <arschmitz> just since its had so little exposure
[14:11:55] <jasperdegroot> i think it's good when we release something
[14:12:05] <jasperdegroot> not just updating master
[14:12:20] <arschmitz> i just worry it has not had enough exposure
[14:12:52] <jasperdegroot> I don't understand
[14:13:02] <sfrisk> well if you want to do a blog post or something, I can help edit - or let me know what you want it to say and I can write it
[14:13:05] <arschmitz> many in the community use the master / git version
[14:13:12] <jasperdegroot> if we release an alpha or beta 1 and do a blog post it will get exposure, right?
[14:13:19] <arschmitz> i think very very few have tried the 1.5-dev build
[14:13:34] <arschmitz> so its somewhat less tested the normal
[14:13:34] <jasperdegroot> yeah I think so too
[14:13:39] <arschmitz> for an alpha
[14:13:40] <arschmitz> or beta
[14:13:55] <arschmitz> so i was thinking something to the effect of
[14:13:55] <jasperdegroot> but I think more people will try a release, even when it's alpha, than trying an update of master
[14:14:19] <jasperdegroot> just my thought
[14:14:36] <arschmitz> thats actually exactly why i wanted to do it
[14:14:44] <jasperdegroot> I agree that we might have not tested enough yet for a beta
[14:14:58] <arschmitz> so if there are major issues they are caught with a smaller user group
[14:15:15] <jasperdegroot> ok I understand
[14:15:32] <arschmitz> we dont want to release something thats totally broken that would be bad PR
[14:15:39] <arschmitz> but if we say hey we merged to master check it out
[14:15:51] <arschmitz> people wont expect it to be as good as if we call it an alpha
[14:16:05] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:16:30] <jasperdegroot> just not sure if there will be enough testers
[14:16:32] <arschmitz> and unless something comes up im just talking basicly do this while we get our ducks in a row for release api etc
[14:16:40] <jasperdegroot> if it's not a release
[14:17:07] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: im really only concerned with catching really large scale breakages not complete testing
[14:17:15] <jasperdegroot> but we could do a blog post and tweet as soon as master has been updated
[14:17:16] <arschmitz> so even a dozen people
[14:17:21] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:17:24] <arschmitz> right thats what im talking about
[14:17:31] <arschmitz> it would not really delay the release
[14:17:34] <arschmitz> it would be interim
[14:17:47] <arschmitz> unless something comes up then it might delay it lol
[14:18:04] <jasperdegroot> just saying I think we shouldn't wait too long with a release
[14:18:04] <arschmitz> does any one else have any thoughts
[14:18:15] <arschmitz> no i agree i dont plan on doing anything to delay the release
[14:18:21] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:18:22] <arschmitz> unless its because we find an issue thats a blocker
[14:18:41] <jasperdegroot> I am sure we will still have things to do when things are merged into master
[14:18:48] <arschmitz> im sure
[14:18:50] <jasperdegroot> so we wouldn't even be able to release
[14:18:58] <arschmitz> exactly thats what im saying
[14:19:00] <jasperdegroot> docs, themeroller, upgrade guide ...
[14:19:09] <arschmitz> we do this while that stuff is getting finished up
[14:19:14] <arschmitz> to try to encourge testing
[14:19:14] <jasperdegroot> ok than I am +1
[14:19:35] <jasperdegroot> then*
[14:19:39] <arschmitz> i think doing more updates is a good thing in general
[14:19:46] <arschmitz> so when we do something like this we can give an update
[14:19:48] <jasperdegroot> yup for sure
[14:21:44] <arschmitz> ok so i dont have much else today that peple are here for
[14:21:55] <arschmitz> i do want to introduce iPaintCode
[14:22:06] <arschmitz> hes going to be around nd trying to contribute
[14:22:12] <arschmitz> hes a co-worker of mine
[14:22:30] <jasperdegroot> that's great
[14:22:39] <apsdehal> awesome
[14:22:49] <apsdehal> Welcome iPaintCode
[14:22:50] <arschmitz> yup we are almost back up to where we were a few years ago for number of team members
[14:22:55] <jasperdegroot> may we know his name? ;)
[14:23:14] <iPaintCode> Thank you and weclome
[14:23:21] <iPaintCode> Mark
[14:23:22] <sfrisk> Hi iPaintCode!
[14:23:28] <jasperdegroot> hi Mark, welcome!
[14:23:41] <iPaintCode> Howdy all!
[14:24:01] <arschmitz> he should be able to help out in general well rounded html, css, and js
[14:24:13] <jasperdegroot> awesome
[14:24:22] <arschmitz> but im sure will have plenty of questions are different parts of the code
[14:26:02] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Should I put up a PR with jscs fix for all of the files except table and selectmenu?
[14:26:14] <arschmitz> apsdehal: that would be great
[14:26:41] <apsdehal> I also added a --fix option to grunt tasks in one of the PRs
[14:28:24] <arschmitz> oh cool i didnt see that but good idea
[14:29:56] <jasperdegroot> I have to go. Later all!
[14:30:12] <arschmitz> later
[14:30:17] <arschmitz> thats all i had today anyway
[14:33:02] <arschmitz> see everyone back on -dev
