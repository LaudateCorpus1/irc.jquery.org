[10:02:30] <ajpiano> howdy folks
[10:02:57] <ajpiano> content meeting ahoy, have a feeling this will be a short one
[10:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[10:03:51] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i know you're here... agcolom kswedberg johnkpaul
[10:04:16] <johnkpaul> hey
[10:04:20] <ajpiano> for learn, i have a few pulls i'm gonna land today and get up the basic of a home page
[10:04:38] <ajpiano> i worked with buritica last week and we have a basic plan for it, but he had to go to colombia at the last minute
[10:04:59] <ajpiano> my plan is to flip the switch tomorrow  regardless
[10:05:24] <ajpiano> it will help more people have at it, i hope
[10:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[10:06:15] <ajpiano> we have to get it on new-css
[10:06:20] <ajpiano> but we have a lot of stuff to get on new-css
[10:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[10:06:36] <johnkpaul> what does getting on new-css actually entail?
[10:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> A LOT of work.
[10:07:00] <johnkpaul> oh ok
[10:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> Most of the sites don't have any styling copied over to new-css.
[10:07:24] <ajpiano> enforcing the markup conventions from http://jquery.github.com/brand.jquery.org/ and making all the themes use that
[10:08:41] <ajpiano> and we have to do it for all the sites to be able to go live with any of them
[10:08:53] <ajpiano> because web-base-template can only be one branch at time
[10:09:48] <johnkpaul> I thought they were deployed separately
[10:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> Each site is deployed separately, but they all run off a single WordPress install.
[10:10:13] <ajpiano> there's only one wordpress install, for sites that are switched on to this
[10:10:14] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:10:30] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[10:10:40] <ajpiano> *.jqueryui.com, *.qunitjs.com
[10:10:43] <johnkpaul> so we have to split up the tasks related to copying over the styling and fixing up the markup
[10:11:08] <johnkpaul> copying over the styling actually as easy as copying css files?
[10:11:37] <ajpiano> i believe so
[10:11:53] <ajpiano> there is some structural differences between how the child theme is organised, from what i can tell
[10:12:10] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: in the "new-css" brand, the jquery.org theme implements the structure properly
[10:12:48] <johnkpaul> meaning that different php files are taken to represent parts of the final page?
[10:12:49] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: ostensibly we have to split up the tasks, but the folks who they'd be split up to have a lot else going on
[10:14:10] <agcolom> Hi, sorry, I'm here!
[10:15:16] <agcolom> (I'm looking after my friends kids then will walk home in about 30 mins)
[10:15:38] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: meaning there apparently has to be this "functions.php", , different layout of index.php, compare https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/new-css/themes/jquery.org to master https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/master/themes/jquery.org
[10:15:42] <ajpiano> hi agcolom
[10:16:45] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: oh ok, so we can just take jquery.org on new-css as an example?
[10:16:49] <ajpiano> yes
[10:17:19] <ajpiano> there's also a "kitchen sink" demo i think, i should be able to get that up on the jquery.github.com/brand.jquery.org page
[10:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.org seems to only have updates.php
[10:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> index.php clearly isn't being used.
[10:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes sense, since it uses a static index.
[10:18:55] <ajpiano> is there a way to have a static index use a different template?
[10:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com uses page.php
[10:21:13] <johnkpaul> is jquery.org the only correct one in new-css?
[10:21:29] <ajpiano> i believe so
[10:21:50] <johnkpaul> and how are these templates chosen for each potential page? I'm guesing somewhere inside web-base-template?
[10:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fairly certain the static index plugin doesn't use index.php at all.
[10:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> It uses the post type.
[10:25:06] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: do you want to just keep on working on web-base-template stuff here cross sites for a little bit
[10:25:23] <ajpiano> it would be really useful, we don't really have anyone owning the new-css stuff which is why it's been stagnating
[10:25:58] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: sure, I think that I know the most about it, at least from our jqsummit tabel
[10:26:11] <johnkpaul> I also told jzaefferer that I'd work on adding that link to source button cross-site
[10:26:24] <johnkpaul> I have to go through new-css jquery.org to see what these changes realy mean
[10:26:29] <ajpiano> yeah, but i also mean in terms of helping out with the new-css transitions for jqueryui.com and friends
[10:26:34] <johnkpaul> all I understand so far is taht there are different markup conventions
[10:26:36] <johnkpaul> yeah, sure
[10:26:55] <ajpiano> yeah, that's what it seems like to me - different markup conventions, and then porting over and testing site-specific css
[10:28:27] <ajpiano> great
[10:29:29] <ajpiano> so, i don't really have any other dispatches from learn right now
[10:30:25] <agcolom> Can I ask something about the how to get started guides?
[10:30:29] <ajpiano> surely
[10:30:49] <agcolom> so, each section should be a separate md file?
[10:31:18] <ajpiano> how long are the sections?
[10:31:59] <agcolom> mine won't be long at all... but I had a look at the Core version and it seemed that each section was a separate file... (on github)
[10:32:36] <agcolom> and then I was wondering how it gets combined?
[10:32:56] <agcolom> (I'd want them to be in a specific order...
[10:33:05] <agcolom> Or could I just have one file?
[10:33:06] <ajpiano> which thing from core are you talking about being separate files
[10:33:15] <agcolom> let me find it...
[10:33:17] <ajpiano> agcolom: in general, the order is determind by order.yml in the site root
[10:33:36] <ajpiano> the files are shown in wordpress in the order they're kept in in there, and you just put the file slugs in the order you want them
[10:34:09] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/tree/master/page/using-jquery-core
[10:34:25] <ajpiano> yeah, that isn't "getting started" :p
[10:34:39] <agcolom> ah! Where is getting started?
[10:35:33] <ajpiano> i don't think we have one in there
[10:35:57] <agcolom> ok, that's why I couldn't find it then ;-)
[10:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> Getting started with jQuery core: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js"></script> END!
[10:36:18] <ajpiano> there is this antique page, lol http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[10:36:38] <ajpiano> agcolom: i think getting started, in general, should be like, the dead on basics of how to download or otherwise source the lib
[10:36:44] <agcolom> do you have a md template?
[10:36:48] <ajpiano> ensure that it's working, and maybe getting something going
[10:37:06] <ajpiano> and then the rest of the learn materials elsewhere actually talk about how to do basics
[10:37:13] <agcolom> yes, I was going to reuse most of http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/getting-started.html
[10:37:28] <ajpiano> yup
[10:37:36] <ajpiano> we don't have a template
[10:37:36] <agcolom> and then add to that a few extra sections
[10:37:42] <agcolom> :-(
[10:37:56] <agcolom> I'm not really a markdown queen!
[10:38:15] <agcolom> Would it be ok to just have one file then?
[10:38:22] <ajpiano> yeah, just make one file for now
[10:38:27] <agcolom> perfect!
[10:38:36] <ajpiano> add a jquery-mobile directory, and a getting-started.md
[10:38:56] <agcolom> and do you have preferred methods for emphasizing text, and for headings?
[10:39:17] <ajpiano> you can refer to any of the other learn site articles for markdown reference, and also http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/
[10:39:51] <ajpiano> agcolom: you just use the number of # at the beginning of a line to correspond to h1-h6
[10:40:04] <agcolom> what is the highest level of heading we should start with?
[10:41:01] <ajpiano> ## h2 i think
[10:41:12] <agcolom> I probably only need 2 levels, so should it be h1/h2 or h2/h3? (ok, so h2/h3)
[10:41:20] <agcolom> great!
[10:42:17] <agcolom> then, who deploys to the server?
[10:43:10] <ajpiano> it will go to the server when it's merged to master
[10:43:36] <agcolom> great! I might try tomorrow morning if I get time...
[10:43:44] <ajpiano> coolio
[10:44:33] <agcolom> so I would put it here? https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/tree/master/page
[10:44:40] <agcolom> (the md file?)
[10:45:14] <ajpiano> you'd add a file called "jquery-mobile.md" to that directory, to serve as the index page at learn.jquery.com/jquery-mobile
[10:45:29] <ajpiano> then you'd add a folder called "jquery-mobile" and in there add a file called "getting-started.md"
[10:45:53] <agcolom> Excellent!
[10:46:22] <ajpiano> then you'd add "jquery-mobile" and "getting-started" into order.yml
[10:46:33] <ajpiano> whereever you wanted them to come in the order
[10:46:40] <agcolom> perfect.
[10:47:09] <agcolom> Can I add iframes (don't scream ;-) ) or maybe just a picture if we can't do iframes?
[10:47:42] <ajpiano> pictures are ok
[10:47:54] <agcolom> ok, I'dd do that.
[10:48:07] <agcolom> they'd go in the jquery-mobile folder
[10:48:09] <agcolom> ?
[10:48:10] <ajpiano> iframes in this content would make me rather nervous
[10:48:17] <ajpiano> no
[10:48:30] <agcolom> that's what I thought (iframes)
[10:48:41] <ajpiano> add a "resources" folder in the site root
[10:49:06] <agcolom> site root being learn.jquery.com ?
[10:49:26] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:49:32] <ajpiano> take a look at https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com for examples
[10:50:03] <ajpiano> of how to include and then reference stuff in that resources dir
[10:50:30] <agcolom> ok. then, should I create a folder in resources for jquery-mobile, or just put the pictures there (directly in resources?)
[10:50:35] <ajpiano> we should probably do it as resources/jquery-mobile/*png
[10:50:36] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:50:51] <ajpiano> otherwise that dir could start to get really hairt
[10:50:53] <ajpiano> hairy
[10:50:54] <agcolom> ok. I'm clear! Thanks a lot :-)
[10:51:00] <ajpiano> great!
[10:51:02] <agcolom> yes!
[10:51:25] <ajpiano> ok, well, here's to us launching tomorrow
[10:51:29] <ajpiano> \o/
[10:51:40] <agcolom> clap clap calp!
[10:52:16] <ajpiano> and if no one has anything else , see you all over back in ... other irc channels
[10:52:50] <johnkpaul> :)
[10:53:05] <johnkpaul> woo!
[10:53:46] <agcolom> Thanks! speak soon...
[11:03:15] <toddmparker> Hi everyone
[11:03:19] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:03:20] <arschmitz_> Hi
[11:03:23] <gseguin> hi
[11:03:31] <toddmparker> the jQuery Mobile meeting is starting up
[11:03:31] <agcolom> hi
[11:03:40] <toddmparker> chime in if you're here
[11:03:56] <toddmparker> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hw7IYRHNtJamXonLCjOfFRzTwRME2hhBbsLCBQzzUHs/edit#
[11:04:25] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:06:40] <toddmparker> hi everyone
[11:06:48] <kpepin> hI GANG.  i'M GOING TO BE LURKING, BUT NOT PARTICIPATING TODAY (WORK RELATED STUFF PILING UP).
[11:06:55] <kpepin> Doh!  Sorry for the caps.
[11:07:04] <toddmparker> are johnbender and JasonDScott_ here
[11:07:30] <toddmparker> kpepin: added you to the attendee list anyway
[11:08:30] <toddmparker> ok, let's start up
[11:08:47] <toddmparker> Working on 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 maintenance releases - started keeping release notes here, working on a changelog (need to be filled out) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.1.2-and-1.2.1-Release-Notes
[11:09:14] <toddmparker> jlembeck is helping me automate the change log automation
[11:09:37] <toddmparker> Making good progress on the 1.3 features and bugs - targeting end of the year.  Collecting notes here - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
[11:09:49] <Wilto> Whatup.
[11:09:58] <toddmparker> I've been reviewing the 1.3 issues and had some Q's for us to quickly discuss
[11:10:11] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:10:22] <toddmparker> 41 open issues / 24 closed issues for 1.3
[11:11:02] <Wilto> gonna do a sprint then
[11:11:09] <toddmparker> first Q
[11:11:10] <toddmparker> Grid as widget - close? roll into navbar? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2126
[11:11:35] <toddmparker> I think we decided to not make this a widget at the summit
[11:12:04] <Wilto> +1 to closing. Did some testing and it just didn’t have legs.
[11:12:18] <toddmparker> is this really just an internal utility for navbar and should be rolled in there
[11:12:31] <uGoMobi> I suggest to first look at grid listviews
[11:12:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, I think it was supposed to be rolled into the educating-devs-about-media-queries effort.
[11:13:08] <uGoMobi> if we do gird listviews only with demo CSS we probably don't need a widget
[11:13:09] <toddmparker> this is the code to just auto apply the right grid and block classes, no RWD business here
[11:13:16] <uGoMobi> s/gird/grid
[11:13:22] <Wilto> RWD--
[11:13:26] <toddmparker> grid list views are css only i believe
[11:13:38] <toddmparker> Related:
[11:13:39] <toddmparker> Listview grid - where are we with this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> kpepin: created a PR
[11:14:44] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5223
[11:15:25] <toddmparker> I don't see that PR linked up to the issue. 4956 is the right issue, correct?
[11:15:32] <kpepin> NOTE:  The POC I created is incomplete...  Only have the floated version done.  Still wanted to add the inline-block versions.
[11:16:53] <toddmparker> kpepin: good you're here since this is your PR
[11:17:20] <toddmparker> looks like you and _|Nix|_ had a conversation about the styles set type attr
[11:17:23] <kpepin> Yeah, I'm in and out right now...  Have a defect at work I'm trying to fix on a deadline, but here at the moment.
[11:17:48] <_|Nix|_> About what?
[11:17:50] <kpepin> Yes toddmparker, I can rip it out per request no problem.
[11:17:59] <_|Nix|_> "styles set type attr"?
[11:18:34] <uGoMobi> does the CSS override the default CSS for listviews?
[11:18:40] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: look at the PR…think your feedback needed clarification anyway
[11:19:03] <kpepin> I was asked to remove the type="css/text" attr from my stle tags by gabrielschulhof
[11:19:19] <toddmparker> gabrielschulhof = _|Nix|_
[11:19:32] <kpepin> Thanks!  Never know who is who with the nicks.  ;)
[11:19:38] <toddmparker> kpepin: I believe these grid styles are triggered off a class?
[11:19:41] <uGoMobi> hi I am Jasper :)
[11:19:52] <kpepin> Correct Todd.
[11:20:01] <toddmparker>  data-layout="grid"
[11:20:16] <kpepin> I was thinking the whole thing could be converted to be CSS driven only to affect the changes.
[11:20:26] <uGoMobi> maybe we should discuss this on -dev when kpepin has time
[11:20:36] <toddmparker> yeah, this is a big one
[11:20:50] <toddmparker> ok, kpepin - hop on -dev when you can to discuss
[11:20:59] <kpepin> Will do.
[11:21:06] <kpepin> Thanks guys.
[11:21:28] <toddmparker> back to the original Q - grid.js = close the feature request to make a widget or move the code into navbar.js?
[11:22:22] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2126
[11:22:37] <toddmparker> I'm inclined to just close
[11:22:42] <uGoMobi> ok let's decide to close it
[11:22:51] <arschmitz_> +1 close
[11:23:20] <uGoMobi> we move the code to navbar.js, if someone uses the grid function in his code it will still work
[11:23:46] <toddmparker> sure
[11:24:16] <toddmparker> we can move this if we want whenever, but I just closed the widgetizing issue
[11:24:25] <toddmparker> one down
[11:24:26] <toddmparker> Grid: should we handle colspans? Probably close - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5168
[11:25:28] <uGoMobi> +1 to close... custom CSS stuff if you ask me
[11:25:34] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:25:38] <toddmparker> very closely related to
[11:25:39] <toddmparker> Other grid ratios - include in structure or make demos? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5164
[11:25:45] <arschmitz_> +1 close
[11:26:13] <arschmitz_> +1 demos dont need that everywhere
[11:26:21] <uGoMobi> for both... add section about RWD to the docs and include demos for this
[11:26:43] <toddmparker> closed the first
[11:27:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: didn't you already added a demo to the demos folder?
[11:27:09] <toddmparker> and the second. three down
[11:27:26] <toddmparker> next
[11:27:28] <toddmparker> RWD grid - include the class to stack blocks in structure css? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4955
[11:27:45] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/grids/grid-stack.html
[11:28:35] <Wilto> -1
[11:28:38] <toddmparker> right, i made this demo page from my jsbin
[11:29:48] <toddmparker> so this touched on how to handle RWD stuff: demos vs. structure
[11:30:19] <toddmparker> My current thinking: include a basic RWD breakpoint in the structure CSS for widgets, but make this apply only if a class is added by the user. By using classes, it makes it easy for people to create custom breakpoints and not have to override ours
[11:30:42] <toddmparker> I did this on tables to test it out: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html
[11:31:26] <uGoMobi> we would have to duplicate all grid CSS
[11:31:31] <toddmparker> the opposite side of the argument is the RWD breakpoints should just be custom css and we should only cover in demos
[11:31:42] <uGoMobi> first without MQ (but with class to opt-in)
[11:31:58] <uGoMobi> then again within MQ and other class
[11:32:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I just had an idea for stack grids: use a max-width MQ to only apply the stack rule below X width
[11:32:24] <toddmparker> by flipping it around, it's way simpler
[11:33:35] <toddmparker> i wanted to discuss this MQ approach here because I want to get as many opinions
[11:34:18] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if I see the difference...
[11:34:35] <toddmparker> i'll make a jsbin for that after uGoMobi
[11:34:48] <uGoMobi> some people still want the grid blocks on small screen, others want 100% widht on small screens
[11:34:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok
[11:35:13] <arschmitz_> I think some basic breakpoints could be good to include if we could find a concensus on what they should be... but that might be hard
[11:35:14] <toddmparker> so simple questions:
[11:36:04] <toddmparker> 1. Should we ship with at least one MQ breakpoint in our widgets so they are baseline responsive out of the gate. We'd ask people to use a class to opt-in to the breakpoint.
[11:36:37] <uGoMobi> I think we should
[11:36:39] <arschmitz_> Yes i think so at least one phone / tablet pc break point
[11:37:03] <agcolom> I like this idea as well
[11:37:36] <arschmitz_> on that something we may want to keep in mind on our choice of break point is in south korea our biggest market their #1 smart phone is the note which is pretty big
[11:38:24] <arschmitz_> (learned that while i was there ha ha)
[11:38:30] <toddmparker> yeah, picking a good breakpoint is tricky
[11:38:47] <toddmparker> is there a site that lists the device-width for devices?
[11:38:57] <toddmparker> not resolution or DPI
[11:39:05] <Wilto> So *that’s* where all the Notes went.
[11:39:10] <toddmparker> heh
[11:39:11] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:39:16] <arschmitz_> they just came out with a note II there
[11:39:33] <toddmparker> so it sounds like people are down with including at least one reasonable breakpoint
[11:39:55] <toddmparker> be a heck of a lot easier to test our code with a breakpoint we can opt into
[11:40:01] <_|Nix|_> As long as they don't release a "Death Note", I'll be at ease.
[11:40:21] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: http://wil.to/_/just-as-planned.jpg
[11:40:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: btw, here is the stacked block demo that uses max-width, way simpler - http://jsbin.com/uwafuz/11/edit
[11:41:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ah ok, I get it
[11:41:22] <uGoMobi> +1
[11:41:37] <toddmparker> cool
[11:41:44] <toddmparker> i can update the code in that demo
[11:41:59] <toddmparker> so we also need a naming convention for these breakpoint classes
[11:42:16] <uGoMobi> ui-breakpoint, ui-responsive
[11:42:24] <toddmparker> if we only offer one, we can just call them breakpoint-std or something
[11:42:50] <toddmparker> ui-breakpoint-[widget]?
[11:43:03] <toddmparker> these should be scoped to widgets, right?
[11:43:15] <toddmparker> ui-grid-breakpoint
[11:43:16] <uGoMobi> I am not sure
[11:43:23] <toddmparker> ui-table-breakpoint
[11:43:27] <uGoMobi> we can scope with .ui-widget.ui-breakppoint
[11:43:44] <toddmparker> yeah, we can use the double classes now
[11:43:46] <toddmparker> ok
[11:44:23] <toddmparker> ok, great
[11:44:30] <toddmparker> we'll hash out naming later
[11:45:00] <toddmparker> alright, i'll let other talk now, this was helpful.
[11:45:02] <toddmparker> thanks all
[11:45:04] <toddmparker> who's next?
[11:45:15] <uGoMobi> I'll go
[11:45:33] <uGoMobi> no objections?
[11:45:34] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:45:37] <uGoMobi> Gabriel and I finished our work on CSS corner styling, branch is merged
[11:45:44] <toddmparker> woo hoo
[11:46:00] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:46:08] <uGoMobi> reviewing and testing PR for new option clear button for text input
[11:46:08] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5281
[11:46:24] <uGoMobi> we have to see what we do with number and date inputs
[11:46:43] <toddmparker> let's talk about that right after
[11:46:48] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:47:00] <uGoMobi> pushed branch unprefixed-transitions with CSS for supporting transitions on IE10 - Mat is looking into transform3dTest() and validStyle() functions
[11:47:00] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875
[11:47:32] <Wilto> hi what hello
[11:47:32] <uGoMobi> did you get it to work Wilto ?
[11:47:58] <Wilto> Nope, still only half-baked—sorry. Got side-tracked.
[11:48:20] <uGoMobi> cleaned up branches (see also Basecamp post)
[11:48:35] <uGoMobi> let's keep it clean :)
[11:48:51] <uGoMobi> delete branch after merge!
[11:49:08] <uGoMobi> working on method demos for API docs
[11:49:08] <uGoMobi> working on table widget CSS (styling)
[11:49:28] <uGoMobi> and really want to focus on RWD and demo stuff after that
[11:49:39] <uGoMobi> that were my updates
[11:50:45] <_|Nix|_> Me?
[11:50:46] <toddmparker> great, thanks uGoMobi
[11:50:49] <toddmparker> sure _|Nix|_
[11:51:00] <_|Nix|_> K, here goes:
[11:51:03] <_|Nix|_> Added tests for form reset and select menu _destroy() ...
[11:51:10] <_|Nix|_> equence test random timeout trackdown continues ...
[11:51:17] <_|Nix|_> s/^e/Se/
[11:51:26] <_|Nix|_> Really weird failure.
[11:51:36] <_|Nix|_> Seems one console.log can make it go away.
[11:51:42] <Wilto> …what
[11:52:00] <_|Nix|_> Also, it might go away if someone with access to Jenkins can upgrade phantomjs and npm there.
[11:52:02] <toddmparker> fun.
[11:52:08] <_|Nix|_> Yeah :-S
[11:52:14] <_|Nix|_> Fixed some issues ...
[11:52:27] <_|Nix|_> Closed 4746 educating reporter on how to detect whether a widget has already been associated with a given element
[11:52:34] <_|Nix|_> Accepted 5287 (minor grammar fix in the demos)
[11:53:02] <_|Nix|_> Fixed 5288 based on the idea in PR 5290 by Krinkle (Apache error_log warnings no longer being generated)
[11:53:12] <_|Nix|_> Failed to reproduce 5285 (function $.mobile.media is injecting a fake style and body, but not removing it, thus rendering the page invalid) by installing Ubuntu 12.10 in VirtualBox.
[11:53:19] <_|Nix|_> That's a weird one too.
[11:53:29] <toddmparker> really odd
[11:53:35] <_|Nix|_>     Short-circuited the unit test comparing our results from $.mobile.browser to core’s $.browser, because $.browser is gone in the git version of core
[11:53:42] <toddmparker> not sure it's worth much more time to investigate
[11:53:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, maybe we should just close it.\
[11:54:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Didn't want to though, just in case it's our code adding the errant tag.
[11:54:23] <_|Nix|_> Jasper addressed most of the options-vs.-defaults in https://docs.google.com/a/intel.com/document/d/1n7ozvhQTLhBj6sPR-LYxuev3p8kcbHjlAM8EBMlQ8GE/edit … a few still need eyes
[11:54:45] <toddmparker> if you want to leave it open, cool. but i'd tag that as low priority since it needs a very specific OS/browser, right?
[11:54:53] <toddmparker> or won't fix. dunno.
[11:55:04] <toddmparker> that options doc is great…for agcolom?
[11:55:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah. We should ask the reporter to mail us their machine :)
[11:55:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: For us.
[11:55:21] <toddmparker> heh
[11:55:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Some options should not be options.
[11:55:28] <toddmparker> ok, nice
[11:55:42] <agcolom> yep
[11:55:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Instead, they should be defaults, just like $.fn.buttonMarkup.defaults = { corners: true, shadow: true, ... }
[11:55:56] <toddmparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[11:56:01] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[11:56:02] <toddmparker> agcolom: you want to hop in?
[11:56:11] <agcolom> ok,
[11:56:25] <agcolom> work this week
[11:56:27] <agcolom> api docs:
[11:56:27] <agcolom> Changed select to selectmenu
[11:56:27] <agcolom> Added example to silentScroll
[11:56:27] <agcolom> Selectmenu now uses the generated examples for options
[11:56:27] <agcolom> Finally got a good understanding of how to attach things to widget events, which will help writing the docs.
[11:56:27] <agcolom> Now need to update to a new version of grunt which will allow us to get automatically generated code examples for events (just like we can do currently for options).
[11:56:27] <agcolom> Need to write the getting started with jQuery Mobile guide for the Learn site.
[11:57:20] <agcolom> the learn site is going live tomorrow, so I'll try to get the guide in soon
[11:57:44] <toddmparker> silentScroll might be a good demo in the new demo folder
[11:57:59] <toddmparker> any demos you make for docs that might be good to expand for the demos, go for it
[11:58:12] <agcolom> ok...
[11:58:15] <toddmparker> agcolom: great stuff, thanks
[11:58:30] <agcolom> been struggling a bit this week as been v busy with work
[11:58:35] <toddmparker> the table stuff is in better shape. with one more rev, it will be ready for you to pull into the new format
[11:58:43] <toddmparker> no worries, it happens!
[11:58:44] <agcolom> also new update from scott G
[11:58:56] <toddmparker> what's that?
[11:59:11] <agcolom> we can now have all code examples be automatically generated (widget options, methods and events)
[11:59:40] <agcolom> That's really good because it guarantees 100% consistency across all jQuery api docs
[11:59:58] <toddmparker> that is great
[12:00:04] <agcolom> so I have to go and make the changes to all the widgets to get that in
[12:00:14] <agcolom> but definitely worth it
[12:00:50] <agcolom> that's it from me
[12:00:57] <toddmparker> thanks
[12:01:05] <toddmparker> gseguin: wanna go?
[12:01:18] <gseguin> sure, it's going to be another short one
[12:01:37] <gseguin> was travelling, missed Bender... bummer
[12:01:50] <gseguin> landed a PR from arschmitz_
[12:02:09] <toddmparker> dang
[12:02:11] <gseguin> and fixed the keyboard staying up issue in filtered listview
[12:02:26] <toddmparker> cool. small thing, but it bugs me
[12:02:35] <toddmparker> anything else?
[12:02:48] <gseguin> will pick up another bug or 2 this afternoon
[12:02:56] <gseguin> that's it
[12:03:03] <gseguin> still very busy at Jive
[12:03:11] <toddmparker> no worries
[12:03:18] <toddmparker> arschmitz: how goes?
[12:03:44] <arschmitz_> while working on the pr gseguin landed i noticed something
[12:03:51] <uGoMobi> oh oh
[12:03:56] <arschmitz_> we are not cleaning up after ourselves in almost all our widgets
[12:04:18] <arschmitz_> only select custom select and fixedtoolbars have _destroy methods at all
[12:04:43] <toddmparker> i wanted to ask about that too. ui has destroy methods for each widget
[12:04:58] <arschmitz_> yeah thats part of the point of the widget factory
[12:05:07] <arschmitz_> is to enforce a lifecycle
[12:05:37] <_|Nix|_> This is a problem similar to on-the-fly options. Widgets can, after all, be swept away if you discard the entire page.
[12:06:05] <_|Nix|_> It only becomes a problem if you want the widget to clean up after itself when you remove the div that it's associated with.
[12:06:12] <arschmitz_> all widgets that modify markup in anyway should have a _destroy() method
[12:06:36] <_|Nix|_> So, for example, if you remove the <input type="range">, a _destroy() method inside slider will make sure the slider-related divs will also be removed.
[12:06:41] <toddmparker> arschmitz: mind adding a ticket for this and list out all widgets that need it?
[12:06:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: Amen.
[12:06:57] <arschmitz_> along this same lines we should update all our event bindings in widgets to use _on to make sure everything that we bind is unbound
[12:07:11] <arschmitz_> yes ill open a ticket
[12:07:16] <_|Nix|_> The problem is, as johnbender argued, that we shouldn't add code which we will then be committed to maintaining unless absolutely necessary.
[12:07:19] <toddmparker> …for both
[12:07:40] <toddmparker> i think we should discuss this when johnbender can chime in
[12:07:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: _destroy() will drive the conversion to _on() ...
[12:07:49] <arschmitz_> but not having destory is just bad pratice too
[12:07:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Absolutely.
[12:08:03] <toddmparker> seems like these are conventions we should follow since we use the widget factory
[12:08:07] <arschmitz_> but yes i think johnbender should be involved
[12:08:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's a slippery slope. Next stop: on-the-fly options.
[12:08:21] <arschmitz_> ^^ exactly
[12:08:31] <arschmitz_> to toddmpark that is
[12:09:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: IOn the long run it's unavoidable though, I think, especially if we intend to merge with UI.
[12:09:13] <_|Nix|_> s/IOn/In.
[12:09:19] <_|Nix|_> /
[12:09:20] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: on the fly options is somewhat of a separate concern
[12:09:30] <toddmparker> this is just the ability to rewind to the original markup
[12:09:33] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_: exactly we should be folowing the rules set forth to make mergeing easier
[12:09:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It also falls under the umbrella of "conventions we should follow since we use the widget factory".
[12:10:05] <toddmparker> yeah, the closer we get to UI conventions, the easier the merge and these are good practices
[12:10:16] <toddmparker> +1
[12:10:27] <arschmitz_> espically destroy its just bad pratice not to revert markup
[12:10:37] <toddmparker> let's make tickets for these and tag them for 1.4 right now
[12:10:46] <arschmitz_> sounds good
[12:10:49] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... I guess _destroy() will be a good place to start
[12:10:56] <toddmparker> if you are fired up and want to take this on for 1.3, we can try to get it done
[12:11:08] <_|Nix|_> But make no mistake: implementing _destroy() will not be trivial.
[12:11:16] <toddmparker> thanks arschmitz
[12:11:24] <_|Nix|_> For example, we'll need a method to revert the effects of applying .buttonMarkup() ...
[12:11:34] <toddmparker> i know we're over but I wanted to introduce you all to jlembeck (Jeff Lenbeck)
[12:11:35] <_|Nix|_> Like, .rmButtonMarkup() or something
[12:11:45] <jlembeck> Hi all
[12:11:47] <_|Nix|_> Hi Jeff!
[12:11:50] <toddmparker> he's a filamented and will be helping out on jQM
[12:12:02] <_|Nix|_> +1
[12:12:05] <toddmparker> he's writing unit tests for the red table plugin right now
[12:12:06] <arschmitz_> its a lot of work for sure
[12:12:27] <uGoMobi> hi jlembeck
[12:12:27] <toddmparker> sorry for the typos, dang auto-correct
[12:12:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Can that not be turned off?
[12:12:43] <jlembeck> autocorrect coming up bunk on my last name
[12:12:53] <agcolom> Hi jlembeck !
[12:12:58] <toddmparker> (_|Nix|_ - I need it so badly most of the time)
[12:13:07] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:13:09] <jlembeck> Stuff I'm working on right now:
[12:13:27] <jlembeck> Working through tests for the Responsive Tables
[12:13:27] <jlembeck> Making sure there are separate widget tests for reflow and column toggle
[12:13:27] <jlembeck> Fixing any bugs that come about during test writing
[12:13:45] <jlembeck> I'm also looking into refresh on it
[12:13:54] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:14:38] <toddmparker> so you'll see a lot more of jlembeck around. he's not a rando.
[12:14:44] <toddmparker> (well...)
[12:14:54] <jlembeck> jlembeck: not a rando™
[12:14:56] <toddmparker> last and least…Mat “The International Incident” Marquis
[12:15:01] <arschmitz_> i had a couple more things :)
[12:15:01] <Wilto> He’s sort of a rando.
[12:15:05] * uGoMobi is opening urban dictionary
[12:15:09] <toddmparker> sorry arschmitz !
[12:15:14] <arschmitz_> thats ok
[12:15:33] <Wilto> Oh, I got nothin’ much to report—just working on the IE10 tests for 3D transforms next. All you, arschmitz_.
[12:15:34] <arschmitz_> have a few things i was asked to pass along
[12:15:49] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[12:15:52] <toddmparker> go for it
[12:15:55] <arschmitz_> first the api site
[12:16:04] <toddmparker> is there a dog's head coming to my bed?
[12:16:09] <arschmitz_> gnarf has asked we give him a couple weeks notice on this
[12:16:11] <Wilto> noooo
[12:16:13] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:16:32] <arschmitz_> the servers are close to capacity right now and he dosent want anything to go down
[12:16:56] <Wilto> DAMMIT GNARF
[12:17:12] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[12:17:39] <toddmparker> let's not forget to give him a heads up when we're a few weeks away
[12:18:06] <arschmitz_> next the company that sponsored the conf in south korea is going to start translating all the sites into korean which we will have on a sub domain
[12:18:14] <arschmitz_> they are starting with mobile
[12:18:21] <toddmparker> great
[12:18:28] <_|Nix|_> Dang! Nice!
[12:18:30] <gseguin> awesome
[12:18:35] <arschmitz_> richard is handleing this right now but thought everyone should know
[12:18:41] <toddmparker> good to know
[12:19:07] <jlembeck> that's awesome.
[12:19:17] <Wilto> Thanks.
[12:19:28] <_|Nix|_> We're turning into GNOME (http://www.gnome.org/) but for the Web :)
[12:19:42] <arschmitz_> final update from asia is some of the members of the other teams have asked that we come up with a way to track good bugs for future dramatic bug readings either in a google doc or with a tag
[12:19:46] <arschmitz_> :)
[12:20:04] <uGoMobi> bugs?
[12:20:10] <arschmitz_> issues
[12:20:14] <uGoMobi> do we have bugs?
[12:20:19] <arschmitz_> lol
[12:20:23] <uGoMobi> only room for improvement :)
[12:20:24] <Wilto> Please—PLEASE—let me do some dramatic readings of jQM bugs.
[12:21:24] <toddmparker> ok, dramatic bug readings. check.
[12:21:33] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:21:44] <arschmitz_> and my very final this is just need a volunteer to review one of my PR's
[12:21:54] <toddmparker> gseguin?
[12:21:56] <jzaefferer> someone knocked?
[12:21:59] <gseguin> yup
[12:22:09] <toddmparker> have time for a PR review?
[12:22:15] <gseguin> yeah sure
[12:22:19] <toddmparker> man, we're up to 25!
[12:22:40] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: maybe you can help us review those, we need someone to really stay on PRs
[12:22:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: is that the same iOS next/prev fix ou asked me to look at?
[12:22:57] <toddmparker> wanna be the new gatekeeper for a while?
[12:23:05] <uGoMobi> s/ou/you/
[12:23:08] <arschmitz_> oh yeah sorry forgot i already asked you uGoMobi yes
[12:23:13] <toddmparker> oh, if so then uGoMobi's got it. wasn't sure which
[12:23:15] <uGoMobi> no it's ok
[12:23:22] <uGoMobi> just checking
[12:23:31] <arschmitz_> its not just ios though android has it too
[12:23:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK ...
[12:23:46] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:24:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll see which ones I'm comfortable with ...
[12:24:10] <uGoMobi> it's another setTimeout... maybe we have to ask johnbender permission ;)
[12:24:24] <arschmitz_> maybe others anything with a next previous button or that you can go straight from one input to another
[12:24:42] <arschmitz_> its 0 though just have to wait for stack to unwind to see if we jumped inputs
[12:25:00] <arschmitz_> not actual waiting for something
[12:25:05] <uGoMobi> let's put PR's on agenda for next week
[12:25:20] <uGoMobi> like we discussed RWD features this time
[12:25:55] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good idea
[12:26:15] <toddmparker> if _|Nix|_ can run through them and elevate the ones that need discussion, that would be ideal
[12:26:29] <uGoMobi> will scan the open PR's before next meeting
[12:26:40] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:26:54] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ is the new king of PRs
[12:27:15] <uGoMobi> Green Button Manager?
[12:27:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz are on triage
[12:27:20] <toddmparker> heh
[12:27:24] <_|Nix|_> *scatch head*
[12:27:29] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:27:33] <arschmitz_> cool
[12:28:07] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: not interested? you've been great on PRs
[12:28:35] <toddmparker> used to be johnbender and gseguin but they are distracted atm
[12:29:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I can certainly look at more of them in the next week than I have in the last week. Lessee where that goes.
[12:30:16] <toddmparker> ok, cool. only if you're interested. it's something that I only want a trusted person to do.
[12:30:50] <toddmparker> ok, i think we should wrap up if there aren't other topics
[12:30:53] <Wilto> He won’t let me do it. :(
[12:31:06] <uGoMobi> why would that be ;)
[12:31:13] <Wilto> Something about being “wholly untrustworthy” and something about “stealing test phones” etc. etc.
[12:31:23] <uGoMobi> you are head of drama now Wilto
[12:31:33] <Wilto> When *wasn’t* I?
[12:32:02] <toddmparker> indeed
[12:33:24] <toddmparker> any more Q's
[12:34:04] <toddmparker> ok, thanks everyone. awesome work all around. really appreciate it.
[12:34:20] <Wilto> +1 to that.
[12:34:24] <_|Nix|_> COol!
[12:34:34] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[12:34:38] <_|Nix|_> Onto new heights in -dev!
[12:34:43] <toddmparker> hee
[12:34:50] * gseguin blows the candles out
