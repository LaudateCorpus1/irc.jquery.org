[12:07:58] <arschmitz> hi
[12:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it might be just the two of us.
[12:10:07] <arschmitz> indeed
[12:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> In that case, let's start with you :-)
[12:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1808 was approved a week ago.
[12:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Are you waiting on anything to merge that?
[12:12:33] <arschmitz> nope i can do that
[12:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> I had two PRs that got merged this week.
[12:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15179: Widget can't be initialized with an option object that has no hasOwnProperty function
[12:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1809
[12:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> Nice simple fix :-)
[12:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15034: Menu items are indefinitely-clickable
[12:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1807
[12:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> I still have three other menu PRs that I opened that didn't get reviewed though.
[12:16:38] <arschmitz> Ill make sure i review them
[12:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9356: Issues with keyboard navigation and scrolling when mouse over the menu
[12:16:40] <scott_gonzalez> PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1806
[12:16:43] <arschmitz> i meant to last week and forgot
[12:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9357: Focus not moved with both keyboard & mouse interactions
[12:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1805
[12:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15157: Can focus menu dividers with the keyboard
[12:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1804
[12:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get all of those into 1.12.2.
[12:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> There's also the sortable PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1793
[12:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> I need to go through the tickets that they opened and make sure everything looks good.
[12:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> Then I can merge the PR. They promised to fix any regressions that get reported :-)
[12:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I think that's all, unless you have something else to discuss.
