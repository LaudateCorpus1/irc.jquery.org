[12:01:21] <jzaefferer> hey
[12:01:29] <fnagel> hey
[12:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:02:14] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> I submitted a PR to fix the Vader theme: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/340
[12:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> It was missing about a dozen settings.
[12:02:57] <jzaefferer> I haven't done anything for UI for a while. One of its devDependencies is going to get a nice update soon, commitplease will support showing the previous, invalid message again: https://github.com/jzaefferer/commitplease/pull/93
[12:03:52] <jzaefferer> hard to review the actual values, diff looks fine to me
[12:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> So this was actually a fair amount of work to do.
[12:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> I pulled down an old, working Vader theme.
[12:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> And then I pulled up the base theme in UI to see where each of the variables is used.
[12:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> I found the values in the good Vader theme, then entered them into ThemeRoller.
[12:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> I then changed the icon color because the icons were barely visible.
[12:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> Then I copied that URL and downloaded the theme to make sure it was working.
[12:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> Then I had to go through the file in the repo and compare all the values, finding the ones that were missing.
[12:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't tested the update itself, but I don't see a reason that it shouldn't work.
[12:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> And definitely doesn't seem like it could make anything worse :-P
[12:07:20] <arschmitz> yeah thats what happens when a theme gives into the darkside...
[12:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I guess I'll merge and deploy.
[12:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> We don't need to do a jqueryui.com release for this, right?
[12:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> Just download.jqueryui.com?
[12:09:13] <arschmitz> i believe so
[12:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I can check which files jqueryui.com pulls in...
[12:11:05] <jzaefferer> Looking at https://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/16?V=1.12.2 there's just one ticket
[12:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> I wish deploy notifications still worked.
[12:11:31] <arschmitz> yeah thats on me thought i would have time while traveling and didnt
[12:11:41] <arschmitz> but i will have time this week for sure
[12:12:03] <arschmitz> work is much calmer now and i have at least a week before i have to fly again lol
[12:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also going to try to fix the resizable bug listed here: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/17?V=1.12.2
[12:12:07] <jzaefferer> Is this only affecting users using the new API or only users using the old API or both?
[12:12:17] <arschmitz> old api only
[12:12:39] <jzaefferer> soo, they could migrate to "work around" the issue?
[12:12:45] <arschmitz> yes
[12:13:05] <arschmitz> its if you call a combo of checkboxes and buttons with .button
[12:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like that fixed the issue with the theme :-)
[12:13:41] <jzaefferer> could just close as wontfix and link to http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.12/#deprecated-support-for-checkbox-and-radio-types-in-favor-of-checkboxradio-widget
[12:13:53] <jzaefferer> instead of fixing code that we're going to delete very soon
[12:14:01] <arschmitz> that would break out backcompat promise though
[12:14:47] <arschmitz> its a simple fix
[12:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> Right, the back compat promise is important so that we can stop supporting 1.11 as soon as 1.13 is out.
[12:14:53] <arschmitz> i just need to loop and type check
[12:15:10] <jzaefferer> alright
[12:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> Because anyone using 1.11 should be able to upgrade to 1.12 with no issues (unless they're still relying on 1.10 deprecated functionality).
[12:15:18] <jzaefferer> then go and fix it :-)
[12:16:37] <jzaefferer> Hopefully releasing 1.12.2 will be smooth sailing then
[12:16:48] <jzaefferer> We didn't change anything serious since 1.12
[12:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you have availability to start working on UI again?
[12:21:28] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to discuss the viability of getting draggable into 1.13 soon.
[12:22:51] <fnagel> nothing for datepicker / calendar
[12:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe jzaefferer doesn't have availability even for this meeting :-P
[12:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today. Hopefully we can release 1.12.2 next week.
[12:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
