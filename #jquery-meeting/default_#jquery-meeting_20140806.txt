[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: fnagel gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov mikesherov_ petersendidit_
[09:01:10] <fnagel> hey
[09:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> Not much of a turn out :-/
[09:03:00] <jperrault> hey
[09:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll start with datepicker.
[09:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> Hey jperrault.
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: How's the clean up going for the calendar split?
[09:03:36] <arschmitz> oh here sorry
[09:04:31] <mikesherov_> hi
[09:05:15] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: i squashed about 20 commits so far and  fixed some missing unit tests. fixing every commit regarding the tests will take some more time
[09:06:07] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: and fixed the issues mentioned in the old PR
[09:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like you're making good progress.
[09:07:14] <jzaefferer> Hey
[09:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> There you are ;-)
[09:07:26] <fnagel> I will push a bransh (hopefully) tomorrow and it would be great if you could take a look and give feedback
[09:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be on vacation starting tomorrow.
[09:07:46] <fnagel> ahh ok
[09:08:39] <fnagel> perhaps jzaefferer could take a look? just want to make sure I's heading in the right direction
[09:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Unless you like playing with reflogs, I suggest branching from your branch when you feel like you've reached a good "save point"
[09:09:15] <jzaefferer> Once I manage to figure out what you're working on, I can probably help with reviews and what-not
[09:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> He's working on the datepicker/calendar split.
[09:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to clean up the history so that the individual commits don't cause test failures.
[09:09:45] <jzaefferer> Still rebasing?
[09:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:09:58] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: I already started with adding branches when fixed some issues
[09:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's already rebased on top of master.
[09:10:02] <jzaefferer> That is, every commit should have passing tests?
[09:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> Now it's just lots of interactive rebasing with edits
[09:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, otherwise it's really hard to review.
[09:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's a massive piece of work.
[09:10:22] <petersendidit_> hey
[09:10:29] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> So reviewing individual commits is necessary.
[09:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> The problem I had was that the first commit introduced lots of failures.
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> And those persisted for a long time.
[09:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> So it was nearly impossible to tell which commits were actually good.
[09:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you get a chance to review the button updates yet?
[09:12:12] <jzaefferer> Alright. I can work with Felix until the 14th, then I'll be more or less gone again.
[09:12:17] <jzaefferer> No, nothing on button yet
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's works. I get back that weekend, though I *may* be offline the next Monday as well.
[09:12:56] <jzaefferer> I'll be in Rio from the 24th, will probably work with Leo on QUnit stuff
[09:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> That should be good.
[09:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to regressions.
[09:13:37] <mikesherov_> HI
[09:13:45] <mikesherov_> re: regressions
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_ fixed some :-)
[09:13:55] <mikesherov_> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10147 still needs to be done
[09:14:01] <mikesherov_> I'm tackling that today after lunch
[09:14:06] <jzaefferer> That is, I'm already working with Leo on QUnit, once 1.15-pre doesn't break stuff, it'll be awesome :-)
[09:14:12] <mikesherov_> I really really hate draggable
[09:14:17] <mikesherov_> like really really
[09:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> We all do :-P
[09:14:25] <mikesherov_> the core of it is atrocious
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> You probably moreso since you actually work with the code to fix bugs...
[09:14:44] <mikesherov_> like even getting rid of the options, it still is awful
[09:15:06] <mikesherov_> Anyway, I have #10147 to fix
[09:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I tried to release this morning, but couldn't because of a problem with the generation of the CDN zip.
[09:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't get anywhere even after a while of debugging.
[09:16:21] <mikesherov_> Oh, so I might be able to sneak in?
[09:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:17:28] <mikesherov_> I g2g. If I make it in, I make it in
[09:17:29] <jzaefferer> Since Scott goes on vacation tomorrow, I could do the 1.11.1 release on Friday
[09:17:40] <jzaefferer> Or whenever we got the build fixed
[09:17:54] <jzaefferer> Rafael can join on IRC, but wants to look into the issue later today
[09:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: When rxaviers gets back online later, I'll try to figure out the problem with him.
[09:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully I can at least get a test run done so that you're all set for Friday.
[09:20:45] <jzaefferer> fnagel: can you do a summary for the selectmenu PRs?
[09:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> _renderButtonItem() (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1299) is good to go.
[09:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> But it's for 1.12.0 since it introduces a new API.
[09:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> The attribute copying (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1298) was waiting on me to finish the browser testing.
[09:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> Which I did this morning and found a few problems with the behavior.
[09:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1298#issuecomment-51325197
[09:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what's going on with Chrome/Safari.
[09:22:59] <fnagel> Item is hovered when navigating with keyboard (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10458) <- I will work on this tomorrow
[09:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't spend any time digging into it, but the behavior was surprising.
[09:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> Pressing the accesskey opened the menu as if it had received focus, but actual focus never moved.
[09:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: This one is interesting. We should see if we can solve it generically.
[09:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> This will be a problem for every widget that uses a menu.
[09:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> Like autocomplete.
[09:25:03] <fnagel> Ok, I will test the behaviour for FF and Chrome on Win again and give some more detailed description
[09:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, we can start with just duplicating the solution in both widgets for now if that ends up being easier than abstracting it out.
[09:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:28:46] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it then.
[09:31:23] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
