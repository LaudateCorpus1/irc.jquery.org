[08:59:14] <jzaefferer> also welcome xavier_
[08:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> pong jzaefferer
[08:59:22] <kborchers> yo
[08:59:34] <xavier_> hey guys, thks jzaefferer
[09:00:07] <jzaefferer> Rafael aka xavier_ has been helping with the download builder, making pretty good progress there
[09:00:58] <rworth> here
[09:01:45] <jzaefferer> Let's skip infra and see if gnarf or danheberden or even clarkbox show up later
[09:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> What's the status on docs?
[09:02:19] <jzaefferer> I update menu and spinner docs, but I don't think anything else happened for docs since the last meeting
[09:02:26] <jzaefferer> *updated
[09:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if things go smoothly, I might finish the release script tomorrow. If that happens, I can start working on docs.
[09:04:03] <scott_gonzalez> Or at least get the release script really close.
[09:04:25] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:04:29] <jzaefferer> no color updates either
[09:04:45] <jzaefferer> your manifest commit 6 days ago is the newest one
[09:05:57] <jzaefferer> nothing on menu methods either, right?
[09:06:01] <danheberden> jzaefferer: poof
[09:06:20] <danheberden> though i'm not the guy you need
[09:06:47] <jzaefferer> danheberden: can you make me a server?
[09:06:50] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i haven't been able to work on menu methods this week. did we decide on the best way to differentiate those methods?
[09:07:04] <danheberden> jzaefferer: no, but i could make you an account ON a server :p
[09:07:35] <jzaefferer> danheberden: will need something soon to host download.jqueryui.com
[09:07:45] <jzaefferer> long-running node process
[09:07:56] <jzaefferer> probably with nginx proxy in front?
[09:07:58] <danheberden> jzaefferer: if it's not already planned for a current box, then it's the two boxes we're waiting on (mt) for
[09:08:19] <danheberden> so, like, the 'make a server' route has been walked down, just waiting on the mythical (mt) gods to answer our prayers
[09:08:20] <jzaefferer> where can I find out if its planned for a current box?
[09:08:30] <danheberden> jzaefferer: infra repo
[09:08:33] <danheberden> the active server plan
[09:08:37] <danheberden> one sec
[09:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I think it's planned for the server with the plugins site.
[09:09:00] <danheberden> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/jQuery-Server-Architecture
[09:09:15] <danheberden> on the builder workhors
[09:09:26] <danheberden> *workhorse - jq02 - which is a 8gb nitro
[09:09:42] <danheberden> can you update the wiki with the download url jzaefferer?
[09:09:52] <danheberden> and other applicable domains?
[09:10:03] <jzaefferer> that's the only one
[09:10:07] <danheberden> ok i'll add it
[09:10:20] <jzaefferer> until it goes live I don't care about staging
[09:10:26] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[09:10:36] <jzaefferer> I'll get back to that or you once we've got something ready to deploy
[09:10:45] <danheberden> will themeroller need its own?
[09:11:00] <danheberden> or is that still /themeroller
[09:11:06] <rworth> it will indeed
[09:11:11] <jzaefferer> will it?
[09:11:13] <rworth> err
[09:11:25] <jzaefferer> let's assume it also goes on Builder Workhorse?
[09:11:46] <jzaefferer> until we start rewriting themerolle, we have no idea really
[09:11:47] <danheberden> alrighty added
[09:11:48] <rworth> yeah, I meant it would need an entry, not its own box
[09:11:53] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:11:55] <danheberden> rworth: yeah, all same box
[09:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know if that's true.
[09:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> All themes are downloaded via download builder.
[09:12:18] <danheberden> it's just our "do big stuff box" and let the serving of files be on a different server
[09:12:25] <rworth> yeah, that was my "err"
[09:12:27] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i just put it there with (maybe)
[09:12:31] <danheberden> as we move forward
[09:12:35] <danheberden> if we don't need it, no biggie
[09:12:35] <jzaefferer> yeah, we shouldn't need a separate domain
[09:12:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do you have input for kborchers on the menu methods stuff?
[09:13:03] <jzaefferer> not from last week isn't very conclusive
[09:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'll probably just address it when I finish the test review.
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there are any code changes related to that.
[09:14:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, anything else you need me to be working on then? menu or otherwise? may not have time this week but should hopefully this weekend
[09:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> API content
[09:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> Reviewing demos in all supported browsers.
[09:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com design + content (where do we stand with that rworth?)
[09:16:00] <rworth> none of that is going on atm
[09:16:08] <rworth> with plugins. ahead of it
[09:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> Did we not get mockups before?
[09:17:14] <rworth> we have comps
[09:17:29] <rworth> old (Augusta) and new (47m)
[09:17:51] <rworth> sorry, by design I meant implementation of design
[09:17:55] <kborchers> ok, i can jump into some of that. jzaefferer did we ever find what that api team from the hack night did and where it is or should i just forget about that and look at design on my own?
[09:18:35] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I have no idea
[09:18:56] <rworth> who was the team lead?
[09:19:12] <kborchers> rworth: i don't know his name
[09:19:20] <rworth> let me check
[09:19:30] <kborchers> rworth: it was the core api lead
[09:19:41] <rworth> Daniel Cohen
[09:19:50] <kborchers> oh right
[09:20:04] <kborchers> i think i remember looking at what we thought was the repo they were working in and it was a mess
[09:20:22] <kborchers> i'll look it up again and see if there is anything we can use
[09:20:50] <jzaefferer> Meanwhile, progress on download builder is going well. At the point where I can generate an almost complete zip file in <1s. Got one idea for making that faster. xavier_ implemented the frontend interactions and started on the CSS styling
[09:20:51] <kborchers> otherwise, i'll just start making changes based on the mockups
[09:21:20] <jzaefferer> generally keeping the TODOs on the wiki up-to-date
[09:21:29] <rworth> way to go jzaefferer . awesome work
[09:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:22:36] <jzaefferer> hoping to have most of theose TODOs done by tomorrow
[09:23:01] <jzaefferer> even without new themeroller, we can at least download with base theme
[09:24:12] <jzaefferer> I think that's all from the agenda, anything else?
[09:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone's interested, here's what I've got for the release: https://gist.github.com/8d509b1716b6b9b14324
[09:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> There are some interesting issues.
[09:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> I should be back to working on that again this afternoon.
[09:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's it.
[09:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> Let's aim for August 17 for release.
[09:26:34] <jzaefferer> doesn't look like there's that much missing
[09:26:53] <jzaefferer> in that script
[09:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, hoping it's not too bad to finish.
[09:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> I've hit a lot of snags along the way.
[09:27:08] <jzaefferer> for the release we still have that big hulking themeroller in front of us
[09:27:27] <jzaefferer> alright, ttyl
[09:27:34] <rworth> lata yals
[12:03:12] <test_> awesome
