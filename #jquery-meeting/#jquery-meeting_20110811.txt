[11:02:47] <_nickel> I'm here!
[11:02:55] <_nickel> as though anyone cared :D
[11:03:00] <kinblas> heh
[11:03:14] <gseguin> hiya
[11:03:44] <toddparker> hi all
[11:03:59] <toddparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting now
[11:04:41] <toddparker> I need to keep this shorter today
[11:04:56] <toddparker> so we can just do a rundown and discuss any open issues
[11:05:05] <scottjehl> hey
[11:05:06] <toddparker> scottjehl is coming
[11:05:11] <toddparker> speak of the devil
[11:05:19] <toddparker> ok, who wants to go first?
[11:05:48] <kinblas> since everyone's jumping ... I'll go
[11:05:49] <kinblas> :-)
[11:05:55] <kinblas> transitions
[11:06:08] <kinblas> We have it working on the transitions branch
[11:06:18] <kinblas> feedback (from  you guys) seems to be positive
[11:06:26] <kinblas> when should we land?
[11:06:50] <kinblas> I've been trying to think about how to unit test the thing, I've only thought up 2 scenarios we need to test for
[11:06:54] <gseguin> nao
[11:06:56] <toddparker> i didn't do a full test sweep, but i'm guessing you've been testing a pretty wide range of devices kin?
[11:07:08] <kinblas> specifically when the "to" or "from" have no transition
[11:07:34] <toddparker> based on the tests of the transition vs. keyframe in isolation, I'm not too worried about this being less smooth
[11:07:37] <kinblas> toddparker: if wide variety means Android 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, iOS 4.3. (iPad/iPod)
[11:07:46] <kinblas> and Blackberry OS6 (Torch)
[11:07:59] <toddparker> so looks like you need me to test on WebOS, Nokia, WP7
[11:08:02] <toddparker> and BB
[11:08:02] <kinblas> I only have 4 Android devices, one being a Xoom
[11:08:20] <toddparker> ...on the ones you tests, are we at least at parity?
[11:08:21] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah I don't have any Symbian, windows or WebOS
[11:08:38] <kinblas> toddparker: yes, I sent out that matrix the other day to mention what I see
[11:08:45] <toddparker> right
[11:08:49] <kinblas> animations are still slooooow on Android
[11:08:55] <kinblas> you can see frames dropping
[11:09:08] <toddparker> ok, let me do some testing tomorrow early and make a call
[11:09:11] <kinblas> but in standalone test cases, transitions really do seem to be faster/smoother than keyframes
[11:09:14] <toddparker> Android is a hot mess
[11:09:20] <_nickel> fact
[11:09:21] <kinblas> red-hot
[11:09:38] <toddparker> our original WebOS Pre is so much more responsive than any Android device I've used
[11:09:50] <toddparker> The Nexus S is disappointing
[11:10:14] <toddparker> So other than testing on devices, is there anything outstanding on this?
[11:10:45] <kinblas> toddparker: just the unit tests I mentioned above. I need to talk to _nickel about that
[11:11:05] <kinblas> toddparker: this stuff is mostly visual so all i can really test for
[11:11:06] <toddparker> ok
[11:11:14] <kinblas> is that the pages switched in those 2 cases
[11:11:18] <toddparker> seems like this is very close then
[11:11:25] <kinblas> yeah
[11:11:27] <toddparker> thanks kinblas!
[11:11:31] <gseguin> I guess all you can test is that the right classes are added/removed
[11:11:34] <kinblas> Other than that, I've been looking at bugs on my plate
[11:11:40] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:11:51] <toddparker> i've been doing a lot of assigning as I triage
[11:11:53] <kinblas> gseguin: right, that was part of the page switching test
[11:12:02] <toddparker> feel free to re-assign if you don't want an issue
[11:12:21] <toddparker> kin, you wanted to talk about the dom cleanup
[11:12:38] <kinblas> toddparker: eh, I guess it isn't as bad as it seems
[11:12:46] <kinblas> was looking through bugs
[11:12:55] <toddparker> do you want to assign all the related issues to you and get em
[11:13:20] <kinblas> sure
[11:13:21] <_nickel> kinblas: are you talking about DOM caching bugs?
[11:13:27] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah
[11:13:50] <kinblas> I was seeing things fly by that I thought were related
[11:13:50] <toddparker> there is certainly some confusion about how ti works
[11:13:50] <_nickel> other than the one you mentioned earlier toddparker, how many are outstanding?
[11:14:03] <toddparker> dunno for sure. kin said he saw a few others
[11:14:12] <kinblas> I think it's what todd said
[11:14:17] <kinblas> folks are still getting used to how things work
[11:14:24] <toddparker> that's for sure
[11:14:25] <_nickel> the one earlier is a case where I would tell him to use the anchor
[11:14:33] <toddparker> i think this is related...
[11:14:34] <kinblas> that coupled with the way the widgets are being initialized now
[11:14:35] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2258#issuecomment-1783815
[11:14:39] <_nickel> unless he wants to load the page dynamically
[11:14:53] <toddparker> the appends a second copy of the starting page
[11:14:56] <toddparker> issue
[11:15:14] <_nickel> I think the homepage as a special case would be one major source of confusion
[11:15:28] <kinblas> _nickel: right
[11:15:30] <_nickel> you have to use different forms of reference depending on if you want it to be dynamic or static
[11:15:40] <toddparker> well, i think it makes sense that we only nuke pages ADDED to the dom via ajax
[11:15:54] <toddparker> the original page, whatever it is, is left alone
[11:15:54] <kinblas> _nickel: when working on the nav re-factor
[11:16:12] <kinblas> it seems to me that external pages should refer to the first-page
[11:16:17] <kinblas> as a deep-link
[11:16:25] <kinblas> for PE purposes
[11:16:36] <_nickel> PE?
[11:16:44] <kinblas> Progressive Enhancement
[11:16:59] <toddparker> or Pork Enchiladas
[11:17:05] <gseguin> lol
[11:17:17] <toddparker> I think I prefer the latter
[11:17:23] <kinblas> we're already resolving relative links relative to the base of the page
[11:17:32] <_nickel> right
[11:17:43] <kinblas> back buttons on those pages shouldn't be any different
[11:18:12] <toddparker> so right now, if you ajax in a page, it doesn't know to go back to the original page in the dom so it asks for the same page again?
[11:18:15] <_nickel> you're saying its confusing to reference something as an anchor because relatively speaking it means something different
[11:19:03] <_nickel> /my/page/ -> #foo-bar-baz is different from #foo-bar-quz -> #foo-bar-baz
[11:19:06] <kinblas> _nickel: I'm not sure I parsed that correctly
[11:19:12] <kinblas> I'm saying
[11:19:18] <kinblas> if page a is the application page
[11:19:25] <kinblas> and b has a link in it
[11:19:34] <kinblas> <a href="#foo" >
[11:19:49] <kinblas> it should be referencing a #foo *inside* b not a
[11:19:57] <kinblas> so that URL should be b#foo
[11:20:02] <toddparker> right
[11:20:11] <kinblas> if folks want to go to a page in 'a'
[11:20:15] <toddparker> so now, #foo refers to the first page?
[11:20:21] <kinblas> it should be <a href="a#foo" >
[11:20:43] <toddparker> i think whatever we can do to make linking to internal pages easier, taht wouldbe appreciated
[11:21:00] <_nickel> so whats the short term solution
[11:21:08] <_nickel> to reap the home page?
[11:21:09] <toddparker> people also ask a lot to link to #bar in an external multipage
[11:21:25] <toddparker> i think that could be too much
[11:21:49] <_nickel> yah I would avoid adding that wrinkle at this stage
[11:21:58] <toddparker> it would fix the issue, but it's not consistent with our rule of only nuking pages added
[11:22:17] <toddparker> i can see a lot of issues fromt hat
[11:22:54] <toddparker> when a page is brought in, can we check links to see if they would go to the parent (original) page and point to that?
[11:23:08] <toddparker> lookup in the page dtack
[11:23:12] <toddparker> stack
[11:23:33] <_nickel> but what if someone wants to dynamically reload that page
[11:23:33] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[11:23:42] <_nickel> technically the home page was loaded via ajax :D
[11:23:42] <kinblas> sorry, my client freaked out
[11:23:42] <toddparker> did you miss the last few messages
[11:23:52] <kinblas> yeah I missed a bunch
[11:24:04] <kinblas> still talking about 2285?
[11:24:11] <_nickel> we're just trying to sort out the quick solution to fixing the home page issue
[11:24:28] <kinblas> so a couple of issues
[11:24:28] <toddparker> _nickel asked if we should nuke hte start page. i said it seemed to dangerous and inconsistent with our rule to only nuke appended pages
[11:24:31] <_nickel> and I'm making the case the the first page load is dynamic in that it comes from the server
[11:24:54] <toddparker> well, the first page isn't ajax'ed in
[11:24:58] <kinblas> I think what we need to do is this
[11:24:59] <toddparker> it's a full page
[11:25:15] <kinblas> the first-page doesn't necessarily have an id
[11:25:26] <kinblas> so it's data-url is blank most of the time
[11:25:38] <_nickel> so what I'm saying is that we have a url for it
[11:25:42] <_nickel> and it is loaded from the server
[11:25:53] <_nickel> so you can actually think of it like ajax if you like
[11:25:54] <kinblas> we do have an url for it
[11:25:59] <kinblas> it's the base url
[11:26:02] <_nickel> :D
[11:26:03] <kinblas> or the page url
[11:26:15] <_nickel> so we could "replace" it
[11:26:19] <_nickel> or
[11:26:22] <_nickel> reap and reload
[11:26:29] <_nickel> either way
[11:26:32] <_nickel> its the same thing
[11:26:33] <kinblas> what's the purpose in re-loading?
[11:26:36] <kinblas> why can't we just tag it
[11:26:40] <toddparker> yeah
[11:26:48] <kinblas> data-url="{page-url}"
[11:26:52] <_nickel> people defining links expect ajax loading
[11:26:57] <_nickel> to my understanding
[11:27:15] <_nickel> and in that case how do you get dynamic content from the home page without a page flash?
[11:27:35] <_nickel> what if the home page isn't actually a "home page" per-se but just the page the user happens to land on
[11:27:44] <_nickel> in the middle of some flow
[11:28:05] <toddparker> wouldn't what kin suggested work
[11:28:24] <_nickel> I thought kinblas was suggesting we just tag and transition back to the existing dom element
[11:28:25] <toddparker> that would pick up the initial page, right?
[11:28:39] <kinblas> _nickel: right
[11:28:40] <toddparker> i think he's just saying we add the attr
[11:28:41] <_nickel> I'm suggesting that people might want the homepage content to reload
[11:29:15] <_nickel> something to think about even if we don't support it
[11:29:20] <kinblas> yeah
[11:29:22] <_nickel> *support it now
[11:29:24] <toddparker> could they just set the dom-cache attr to make that happen?
[11:29:30] <_nickel> toddparker: yes!
[11:29:34] <_nickel> but we'd have to reap it :D
[11:29:39] <_nickel> thus
[11:29:40] <toddparker> i dunno if it works like that now
[11:29:46] <kinblas> we need to be careful here
[11:29:48] <_nickel> reap and relaod
[11:29:50] <_nickel> or "replace"
[11:29:52] <kinblas> the framework tracks the first-page
[11:29:53] <_nickel> kinblas: true
[11:30:01] <_nickel> alright
[11:30:04] <_nickel> clearly thats a feature
[11:30:12] <toddparker> seems like we should discuss in depth on -dev
[11:30:15] <kinblas> and uses that as a fallback in cases where things fail
[11:30:16] <_nickel> so should we just address the current state which is a non dynamic home page
[11:30:24] <kinblas> yeah
[11:30:27] <toddparker> yeah
[11:30:30] <_nickel> sorry
[11:30:31] <_nickel> tangent
[11:30:35] <_nickel> tabled!
[11:30:40] <toddparker> k :)
[11:30:43] <toddparker> soooo
[11:30:43] <kinblas> _nickel: no it's a valid usecase
[11:30:49] <toddparker> _nickel...wassup?
[11:30:58] <_nickel> toddparker: just saying we can tabled it :D
[11:31:12] <_nickel> s/tabled/table/
[11:31:53] <toddparker> sure
[11:32:04] <toddparker> sorry, was asking what you're up to _nickel
[11:32:08] <_nickel> ah!
[11:32:09] <_nickel> ok
[11:32:09] <toddparker> (if kinblas is done)
[11:32:14] <_nickel> the refactor landed
[11:32:20] <_nickel> I closed a bunch of pull requests
[11:32:33] <_nickel> as in I merged them or closed them
[11:32:33] <_nickel>  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1765
[11:32:38] <kinblas> toddparker: done ... just wanted to mention the other issue I'm looking into is the stray clicks over inputs
[11:32:59] <toddparker> cool
[11:33:22] <toddparker> i saw those pulls - thanks so much!
[11:33:33] <_nickel> toddparker: that one needs your eyeballs
[11:33:49] <_nickel> I'm going to work on getting a CI server set up on Adobe hardware today / tomorrow
[11:33:59] <toddparker> ok
[11:34:01] <_nickel> unless the pushstate branch is in dire need of testing/review
[11:34:06] <_nickel> that was the next thing on my list
[11:34:16] <toddparker> that would be cool to land sooner rather than later
[11:34:23] <_nickel> hmm
[11:34:32] <_nickel> I'm not totally certain the CI server at OL is still working properly
[11:34:38] <toddparker> actually, you can wait on that
[11:34:42] <_nickel> no one is watching it since I left I think
[11:34:46] <toddparker> scott has a few things to do first
[11:34:50] <_nickel> kk
[11:34:53] <_nickel> then CI server it is
[11:34:59] <toddparker> gseguin?
[11:35:01] <_nickel> I'm going to automate that install
[11:35:04] <kinblas> regarding pushState
[11:35:06] <_nickel> sorry one quick question
[11:35:21] <gseguin> been working on small bugs
[11:35:24] <_nickel> I'm going to automate the install, and we should post the code for the project somewhere
[11:35:27] <gseguin> and a bigger one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2262
[11:35:28] <_nickel> any thoughts?
[11:35:36] <_nickel> actually we can talk about that in dev
[11:35:39] <kinblas> I wanted to chat with scott/_nickel regarding a way to implement it in a way that devs can also use the same mechanism to update the URL and decode it
[11:35:39] * _nickel falls silent
[11:35:48] <gseguin> going to land that today after a small refactor
[11:36:10] <gseguin> go ahead _nickel, I was typing away
[11:36:18] <_nickel> nope it can wait
[11:36:19] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:36:51] <gseguin> yeah that's pretty much it for me, going down the list of unassigned "critical" bugs
[11:36:57] <gseguin> and see if I can address them
[11:37:00] <toddparker> cool, thanks!
[11:37:09] <toddparker> i tagged a bunh of issues to you too
[11:37:15] <toddparker> everyone has a bug old pile now
[11:37:32] <gseguin> oh!
[11:37:36] <gseguin> one more thing
[11:37:38] <toddparker> scott is looking at pushState
[11:38:03] <gseguin> Packt Pub contacted me, they're looking for an author for a "jQuery Mobile Cookbook"
[11:38:13] <toddparker> right, saw that
[11:38:24] <toddparker> they have a bunch of jQM books out an in the wings
[11:38:45] <gseguin> I don't feel like I have acquired enough knowledge to take up the task, nor do I think I have the skills and time
[11:38:59] <gseguin> but if one of you is interested, I would love to help out
[11:39:08] <toddparker> if you guys are more interested in helping to tech edit/refine a book, we can dicsuss that
[11:39:13] <_nickel> now that I'm thinking about it a "cookbook" should be done by someone who's using it all day every day
[11:39:21] <toddparker> there is an author who wrote a 4-500 page jQM book
[11:39:26] <_nickel> yah that guy
[11:39:29] <_nickel> he was tweeting
[11:39:37] <kinblas> name?
[11:39:40] <toddparker> but he's french so it needs a english speaker and tech refiner
[11:39:47] <gseguin> hmm
[11:39:49] <toddparker> Eric
[11:39:54] <gseguin> that sounds like a job for me
[11:39:56] <toddparker> Sarron?
[11:39:56] <gseguin> :D
[11:40:02] <toddparker> yeah, right!
[11:40:27] <_nickel> like Yogg Sarron?
[11:40:37] <toddparker> he offered to donate the book to the project
[11:40:38] <_nickel> http://www.wowwiki.com/Yogg-Saron
[11:40:40] <toddparker> who dat?
[11:40:50] <toddparker> woah
[11:40:51] * _nickel is far nerdier than you could possibly imagine
[11:40:56] <gseguin> nerd alert!
[11:40:58] <toddparker> yup
[11:41:10] <toddparker> where is the weggie command on IRC
[11:41:12] <_nickel> If I haven't already I will bring my D&D references
[11:41:22] <_nickel> toddparker: you know I could bench press you :D
[11:41:30] <toddparker> oh, i kno wit
[11:41:34] <_nickel> lol
[11:41:41] <_nickel> </hubris>
[11:41:42] <toddparker> scared
[11:41:55] <gseguin> alright if you have his info and need me to do something on that front let me know
[11:42:26] <gseguin> what's his twitter handle?
[11:44:32] <toddparker> not sure
[11:44:34] <toddparker> been emailing
[11:44:48] <gseguin> ok, we can take that offline
[11:44:49] <toddparker> btw - if you guys want to write a book, go for it
[11:44:54] <toddparker> didn't mean to derail ya
[11:44:55] <toddparker> sure
[11:45:02] <toddparker> ok, i think that's it
[11:45:08] <_nickel> I'm writting an expose on all the infighting we have on this project
[11:45:14] * _nickel will be rich
[11:45:18] <toddparker> i'm going to try and do more triaging and create a list of beta 3 items
[11:45:28] <toddparker> if you all wantot tag to beta 3 in the tracker, please do
[11:45:34] <toddparker> :)
[11:45:40] <toddparker> yeah, let's argue!
[11:47:03] <toddparker> ok, i think that's it
[11:47:07] <toddparker> we'll re-connect on -dev
[11:47:12] <toddparker> thanks all!
[11:48:07] <gseguin> see you on -dev
