[11:00:34] <eddiemonge> set #jquery-meeting +m
[11:01:01] <eddiemonge> oops, jk
[11:01:02] <eddiemonge> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/eddiemonge.com/jquery%2520mobile
[11:10:14] <eddiemonge> Todd/Mat looking into ajax stuff
[11:11:14] <eddiemonge> Creating smaller widgets to help out.
[11:12:36] <eddiemonge> A lot more work is taking place in branches in git now
[11:14:54] <eddiemonge> A few teams, not just the mobile team,  are working on getting branch previews on our servers
[11:15:13] <eddiemonge> That will help core, UI and mobile so its a project wide effort
[11:16:37] <eddiemonge> With Google Hangouts, we can now screen share
[11:19:55] <eddiemonge> There was a color picker pull request a few weeks back that had some cool features, besides the color picker portion
[11:20:22] <eddiemonge> it introduced a popup that is lighterweight than a dialog that may get repurposed and reused
[11:21:05] <eddiemonge> its a smaller footprint than dialog and is a modal overlay that doesnt replace the whole page like dialog does
[11:23:32] <eddiemonge> the ajax "plugin" is being referred to as fetchlinks for now
[11:26:38] <eddiemonge> kinblas is working on transitions
[11:26:47] <eddiemonge> checking why there are the flashes on android
[11:26:54] <eddiemonge> and generally speeding them up overall
[11:29:42] <eddiemonge> Transitions may have to be rethought for pages with lots of contents
[11:34:00] <eddiemonge> There are a lot things to take into consideration with the transitions and narrowing down bottlenecks is pretty hard and is taking time
[11:34:12] <eddiemonge> Sencha seems to have the same issues, if not more blinky
[11:38:03] <eddiemonge> Part of the "slowness" is the 'click' handler and hash change
[11:42:39] <eddiemonge> The framework shouldnt change or wait for one specific platform
[11:45:26] <eddiemonge> Fixed headers/footers are problematic but are being looked into by garann
[11:46:30] <eddiemonge> not all devices seem to support position: fixed or they do some wonky things for it
[11:50:15] <eddiemonge> If things can be done in CSS they should be since it should be faster than doing it in javascript
[11:51:49] <eddiemonge> Even though things are supported on devices/browsers, doesnt mean its the best thing to use or the most performant
[11:52:09] <eddiemonge> so alternatives need to be researched and optimizations put into place
[11:55:01] <eddiemonge> Git branching standards for the project need to be hashed out so there isnt any confusion and talks about that will happen soon in the -dev channel
[11:56:34] <eddiemonge> gseguin is working on build dependencies and getting rid of php as a req for the project
[11:56:43] <eddiemonge> but it swaps in a dep on requireJS
[11:56:50] <eddiemonge> and at build time it requires nodeJS
[11:59:51] <eddiemonge> this could allow for custom builds, including jqm in other AMD projects and some fun stuff
[12:02:32] <eddiemonge> and that concludes todays jQuery Mobile meeting
