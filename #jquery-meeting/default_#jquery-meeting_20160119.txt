[14:02:48] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting time!
[14:02:55] <sfrisk> arschmitz, kristyjy, geekman-rohit
[14:03:00] <arschmitz> hi
[14:03:03] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:03:38] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:03:53] <kristyjy> hi
[14:04:49] <sfrisk> Sow we have two things on the agenda today
[14:05:02] <sfrisk> first up is the typography variables rewrite with geekman-rohit
[14:05:03] <sfrisk> So* we
[14:05:13] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/139
[14:05:35] <sfrisk> which is currently a WIP, but he did bring up some topics that I think we shoud discussion
[14:05:35] <geekman-rohit> I have to add a few more things , which should be this weekend
[14:05:43] <sfrisk> shoud discuss*
[14:05:45] <geekman-rohit> since i have a looong weekend
[14:05:50] <sfrisk> yay weekends!
[14:05:52] <geekman-rohit> 4 days in a row
[14:06:20] <geekman-rohit> I dont like the uppercase thingy marestad did
[14:06:25] <geekman-rohit> looks opinionated to me
[14:06:46] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/139/files
[14:07:21] <sfrisk> yeah, I put a note in that we could move that sort of stuff with a variable
[14:07:26] <geekman-rohit> I like what sfrisk suggested
[14:07:27] <sfrisk> similar to what I did in the latest buttons PR
[14:07:40] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/96-buttons-take-two/demos/buttons.html
[14:07:46] <geekman-rohit> yes, I'll do that and Ill leave default to normal
[14:08:41] <sfrisk> that way if someone wants to change it, it is a relatively easy change - more so when we have a themeroller
[14:08:55] <arschmitz> hi sorry conflict meeting here now
[14:09:26] <sfrisk> lol
[14:09:32] <sfrisk> Darn meetings
[14:10:57] <sfrisk> But yeah, I think a good thing is anything that could be considered opinionated, or we think people might want to tweak - put in a variable
[14:11:41] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:11:57] <geekman-rohit> also I didnt get time to read all of this :https://scotch.io/tutorials/aesthetic-sass-2-colors
[14:12:08] <geekman-rohit> but looks good so far
[14:12:22] <geekman-rohit> as long as we have a uniform way of using colors Im happy
[14:12:31] <sfrisk> I like some of what they have for pallets and varients in pallets - which is good for covering hover/focus/etc states of colors
[14:12:53] <sfrisk> since I didn't quite like the way the programatic colors came out for the buttons
[14:12:57] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/96-buttons-take-two/demos/buttons.html
[14:13:28] <sfrisk> so I think I'm going to take that and use it to be more specific about what the active/focus/hover colors are
[14:13:34] <sfrisk> and I think that will look a lot better than what I have
[14:14:17] <sfrisk> I mostly just used base 500 colors in the google design color pallet https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette
[14:14:47] <geekman-rohit> I do that too
[14:15:02] <sfrisk> palette*
[14:15:07] <sfrisk> I cannot spell today
[14:15:10] <geekman-rohit> but that much bold colors would look better with some shadows, instead of just flat
[14:15:48] <geekman-rohit> I like your default colors though, they look good
[14:15:48] <sfrisk> but I might use that as our base colors, with a light and dark option
[14:16:03] <sfrisk> and I think that will make the buttons look a lot better
[14:16:15] <geekman-rohit> shadows please :P
[14:16:20] <geekman-rohit> a little
[14:16:35] <sfrisk> haha, yeah, I was considering adding a slight shadow - but make that a variable for people who want a flat design
[14:16:44] <geekman-rohit> the elevation
[14:16:52] <geekman-rohit> it makes it obvious the thing is clickable
[14:17:22] <sfrisk> shadows do seem to be in now, but I would like it to remain an optional feature
[14:17:26] <geekman-rohit> i find bootstraps smaller buttons too much like labels.. at first sight, they dont look like they can be clicked
[14:17:40] <geekman-rohit> sounds good to me
[14:17:43] <sfrisk> for when the inevitable design change occurs and shadows are no longer hip
[14:17:50] <geekman-rohit> we could have a global variable
[14:18:00] <geekman-rohit> if set to false, all elevations disabled. hurrah

[14:18:27] <geekman-rohit> what?
[14:18:33] <sfrisk> ... sorry, saying hip makes me think of that
[14:18:33] <kristyjy_> sorry I disconnected.. vpn troubles
[14:18:42] <geekman-rohit> wait what was that
[14:18:49] <sfrisk> the music?
[14:18:54] <geekman-rohit> the b-ot
[14:18:58] <geekman-rohit> how did it reply
[14:19:06] <sfrisk> a bot in the room, probably responding to a youtube link being posted
[14:19:10] <geekman-rohit> when did it start working
[14:19:25] <sfrisk> No idea
[14:19:28] <geekman-rohit> `team
[14:19:34] <geekman-rohit> `chassis-team
[14:19:36] <geekman-rohit> what was that
[14:19:41] <sfrisk> I can't remember
[14:20:30] <arschmitz> that needs to be set up again
[14:20:36] <arschmitz> bot is here but he has amnesia
[14:20:40] <arschmitz> and its permenent
[14:20:46] <arschmitz> need to re teach him
[14:20:56] <sfrisk> Silly bot
[14:21:24] <sfrisk> so yeah, I'll add shadows, and the palette stuff
[14:21:26] <geekman-rohit> b-ot should learn from BB8
[14:21:36] <sfrisk> since doing 20% darkening REALLY doesn't work across all the different colors
[14:21:44] <sfrisk> and it was pretty opinionated of me in how I set that
[14:21:53] * sfrisk judges previous sfrisk
[14:22:03] <geekman-rohit> and I'll finish typography variables
[14:22:16] <sfrisk> kristyjy, scss guide by next week?
[14:22:29] <geekman-rohit> if I could do that with the pallette, nothing would be more fun though :D
[14:22:42] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy_
[14:22:55] <sfrisk> I could commit the palette separately - for use for both of us
[14:23:04] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:23:30] <kristyjy_> Yes.. style guide I was consumed by job applications last week but I have less this week so that shall happen!
[14:24:30] <sfrisk> okay, sounds good
[14:24:55] <geekman-rohit> i think we could like set up a google doc for that ?
[14:24:57] <sfrisk> so I'll try to get palette done earlier in this week so people can start reviewing it and judging it
[14:25:04] <geekman-rohit> for the style guide
[14:25:10] <sfrisk> for people to contribute?
[14:25:14] <sfrisk> that actually might work....
[14:25:17] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy_ could give us comment access and decide what goes in
[14:25:24] <geekman-rohit> and we could all throw in our opinions
[14:25:30] <kristyjy_> yeah sounds good
[14:25:35] <sfrisk> it would allow a quicker turn around for feedback
[14:25:43] <geekman-rohit> and more ideas
[14:26:03] <geekman-rohit> and documentation is tedious task, more help this way
[14:26:08] <sfrisk> We could have a part of the doc also be the "stuff we'll propose goes in the CSS style guide"
[14:26:14] <sfrisk> I'm good at grammar checking
[14:26:22] <kristyjy_> that would be super helpful :) I like it!
[14:26:23] <sfrisk> Can't do it on myself, but I can check other people
[14:26:43] <sfrisk> My plan was if programming never worked out for me, was to do the whole editor thing
[14:26:56] <sfrisk> All the red marker
[14:27:08] <geekman-rohit> but well
[14:27:14] <geekman-rohit> good for the writers
[14:27:15] <geekman-rohit> it worked
[14:27:17] <geekman-rohit> :P
[14:27:19] <sfrisk> lol
[14:27:46] <sfrisk> okay, do you want to set that up, kristy, and we can PM you with emails for comment access?
[14:27:56] <sfrisk> kristyjy_
[14:28:08] <kristyjy_> yup I can do that now
[14:28:26] <kristyjy_> I'll make it an empty doc for now and paste what I have in there tonight
[14:28:36] <geekman-rohit> yay to that
[14:28:52] <sfrisk> okay
[14:28:58] <sfrisk> And we can help out with that
[14:29:06] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk and me could put in how we want to add variables/maps in jsass
[14:29:10] <sfrisk> and I think at this point we've started forming opinons on variables/maps
[14:29:13] <sfrisk> .... hahaha
[14:29:17] <sfrisk> great minds think alike!
[14:29:18] <geekman-rohit> jinx :D
[14:29:40] <sfrisk> Okay, I think we've got a good plan for next meeting then
[14:29:47] <geekman-rohit> and a long weekend!!!
[14:29:59] <sfrisk> I'll try to get palette stuff out ASAP (someone feel free to yell at me too, if the PR isn't up by thursday)
[14:30:22] <geekman-rohit> Ill ping
[14:31:27] <kristyjy_> i'll post the link to the doc in a second.. my internet is being soooo slow today
[14:32:13] <sfrisk> someone is probably doing something naughty with the net
[14:32:30] <kristyjy_> lol I wonder
[14:32:45] <geekman-rohit> we have any hackers on the team?
[14:32:55] <geekman-rohit> like networking geeks
[14:33:21] <geekman-rohit> network security experts
[14:33:23] <geekman-rohit> etc. ?
[14:33:35] <kristyjy_> here's the edit link just request access from me https://docs.google.com/document/d/14REmIHA6U4sIlmkqiqCFTRKh0u1rJfPKn8x657bCkOo/edit
[14:33:56] <sfrisk> done
[14:35:45] <geekman-rohit> done
[14:36:32] <sfrisk> Awesome
[14:36:39] <sfrisk> Okay, so that was my two big topics
[14:36:59] <sfrisk> I think if we can get palette done by this week, a pretty solid SCSS draft, and the typography pr done, we'll be in good shape
[14:37:12] <sfrisk> for the purpses of the PR, I might have this buttons PR cover basic buttons only
[14:37:23] <sfrisk> we can have a separate PR for stuff like button bars
[14:37:35] <kristyjy_> woot I'll be keeping an eye on my email if arschmitz needs access
[14:37:47] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:37:55] <sfrisk> Okay, anyone else have anything they want to bring up?
[14:38:22] <geekman-rohit> sounds a good plan for this week
[14:38:57] <sfrisk> okay
[14:39:10] <sfrisk> see you guys in the google docs, issues, css-chassis chat, and all that jazz :-D
