[09:01:44] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I'll clean up the spam after the meeting and fill in the proper ticket count.
[09:01:54] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:18] <arthurvr> hey
[09:02:49] <jzaefferer> its at a point where considered writing a script to delete the spam :/
[09:03:07] <arthurvr> Ugh :/
[09:03:19] <jzaefferer> maybe using intern with webdriver :p
[09:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ryan is making progress. Slowly, but making progress.
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> We should have a much better situation once everything is upgraded.
[09:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> Everything we're using for Trac is really old.
[09:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> So, button...
[09:05:31] <arschmitz> needs review
[09:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> I should have time to review it early next week.
[09:05:39] <arschmitz> cool
[09:05:54] <jzaefferer> position PR should be good to land now
[09:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> I only made some progress on it before I left for vacation.
[09:06:09] <arschmitz> yeah i fixed everything you commented on already
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm mostly out of catch-up mode.
[09:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> But I've got work work to do, and my India presentation.
[09:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> Position PR is ready to land.
[09:07:28] <arschmitz> cool
[09:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Any idea if I did a full review or a partial review of the AMD demos?
[09:08:03] <arschmitz> partial
[09:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[09:08:09] <arschmitz> it was only accordion and datepicker
[09:08:13] <arschmitz> as a POC
[09:08:18] <jzaefferer> I started reviewing AMD demos
[09:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, I don't intend to review every demo anyway.
[09:08:57] <arschmitz> i opened and tried every demo
[09:09:02] <arschmitz> so none SHOULD be broken lol
[09:09:44] <jzaefferer> Scott, take a look at the effects-all shortcut in demos/bootstrap.js
[09:09:51] <jzaefferer> I think that's the only major change since the PoC
[09:10:23] <arschmitz> yeah that was way to big a list to stick in a data attribute lol
[09:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually looking at that right now.
[09:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> Have half a comment written about it already :-P
[09:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[09:12:10] <arschmitz> one other small thing
[09:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> I had an initial concern, but I don't think it's important. I documented my thought process in a comment though.
[09:12:34] <arschmitz> i now wrap the eval code in an IIFE
[09:12:45] <arschmitz> so that return statements work
[09:12:58] <arschmitz> and we dont do everything in the true global scope including variables
[09:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> I think this is good to land if jzaefferer gives a +1.
[09:14:55] <arschmitz> cool
[09:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> And the i18n stuff is handled in the jqueryui.com repo, right?
[09:15:20] <arschmitz> yes
[09:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> seems good
[09:15:34] <arschmitz> im updating that to push right now
[09:15:50] <arschmitz> just need to double check all the demos
[09:15:58] <arschmitz> in the built versions
[09:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> What's the status of DB CSS?
[09:16:20] <jzaefferer> I'm gonna scroll through the whole thing...
[09:16:29] <jzaefferer> I just pinged Rafael about it, I don't think he's worked on it
[09:16:38] <jzaefferer> asked him to move it to the top of his todo list
[09:16:45] <arschmitz> yeah i have not seen any work in quite some time
[09:16:53] <jzaefferer> Its like he's less available now that he's got a baby /o\
[09:16:54] <arschmitz> i think hes been busy on globalize
[09:16:59] <arschmitz> that too
[09:17:33] <jzaefferer> do we include demos.css on jqueryui.com?
[09:17:39] <arschmitz> yes
[09:18:01] <arschmitz> in the form of <link rel="stylesheet" href="/resources/demos/style.css">
[09:18:32] <jzaefferer> so we'll have to override the visibility:hidden
[09:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, well, do you remember what happened when I had a baby?
[09:18:57] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yup
[09:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> At least he didn't have to change jobs because of it :-)
[09:19:37] <arschmitz> actually thats how i got my first contract too
[09:19:45] <jzaefferer> Wasn't that when you got (paid?) leave and did tons of work for a few weeks?
[09:19:47] <arschmitz> having a baby
[09:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, that was my second kid.
[09:20:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: about that datepicker rebase, which is currently blocking Felix. Is there some way around that? Merge commits? If not, can you document what you do? Or record your resolutions with rerere or something?
[09:21:08] <scott_gonzalez> I had a big spike in productivity during paternity leave.
[09:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with a merge commit.
[09:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably a lot cleaner right now anyway with the massive changes happening in master.
[09:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> rerere scares me
[09:21:57] <arschmitz> iv done it before
[09:22:03] <arschmitz> but i dont like it
[09:22:08] <arschmitz> and never did it again lol
[09:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm always afraid I'll record a mistake.
[09:22:23] <arschmitz> yup
[09:25:20] <jzaefferer> you can still look at the result...
[09:25:37] <jzaefferer> fnagel: its now okay to do a merge!
[09:26:09] <jzaefferer> Not sure if he's still around
[09:26:12] <jzaefferer> I think that's all
[09:26:13] <fnagel> sure
[09:26:21] <fnagel> So datepicker is rebased?
[09:27:06] <jzaefferer> Scott wrote, "I'm fine with a merge commit. It's probably a lot cleaner right now anyway with the massive changes happening in master."
[09:27:18] <scott_gonzalez> Not yet, but even a merge is going to result in conflicts.
[09:27:26] <scott_gonzalez> I can work on that before the next meeting for sure though.
[09:27:53] <fnagel> I'm off until monday staring tomorrow
[09:28:10] <rxaviers> hey guys, I'm here now. About DB, yeap I didn't have time to dig into jzaefferer reviews yet /o\. But, I will.
[09:28:18] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: would be nice, thanks!
[09:44:10] <arschmitz> ok well i have a few more PR outstanding still
[09:44:18] <arschmitz> mousewheeel and simulate
[09:44:32] <arschmitz> which once we land we can update to test against custom jquery by default
[09:44:44] <arschmitz> and also the core breakup if anyone has thoughts on folder structure
[09:54:35] <arschmitz> well seems like we lost everyone guess ill close the room :-)
[09:54:50] <arthurvr> :p bye arschmitz
[09:54:57] <arschmitz> actually content is now
[09:55:01] <arschmitz> so ill leave it open lol
