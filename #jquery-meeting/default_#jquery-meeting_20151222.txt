[14:14:25] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:14:41] <sfrisk> (sorry I was in a work meeting, so I'm late in getting here)
[14:14:48] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, kristyjy
[14:15:06] <arschmitz> hi
[14:22:16] <sfrisk> hey
[14:22:22] <sfrisk> might be hard this week, with the holidays
[14:22:33] <sfrisk> also I'm not going to be around next week either
[14:23:40] <arschmitz> ok
[14:25:18] <sfrisk> mostly because for the past 25 minutes, each time I try to write in here, I've been dragged away to something else
[14:25:29] <arschmitz> lol
[14:28:17] <sfrisk> okay, so I might call this meeting a wash, unless we we want to go through the remaining tickets and make decisions on them
[14:28:32] <sfrisk> since I don't think we heard anything from the issues we were waiting on responses from
[14:28:34] <arschmitz> no point with ot others
[14:28:50] <arschmitz> someone might want to pick them up
[14:30:53] <sfrisk> true
[14:30:54] <sfrisk> okay
[14:31:10] <sfrisk> so I'll try to make it online next week, but I'll be visiting family that doesn't believe in internet sooooo
[14:31:28] <arschmitz> lol ok
[14:32:47] <sfrisk> so tentative no meeting next week unless you want to run it?
[14:32:58] <arschmitz> probably best to just wait
[14:33:13] <arschmitz> all the meetings rest of the week are canceled
[14:33:16] <arschmitz> and same next week
[14:33:24] <arschmitz> wed-fri
[14:34:49] <sfrisk> okay
[14:34:56] <sfrisk> well then, I'll call this meeting good
