[09:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: fnagel jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:01:14] <rxaviers> Hello
[09:01:45] <fnagel> hez
[09:01:47] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:02:01] <mikesherov> missing the meeting, but lmk offline scott_gonzalez what you need
[09:02:01] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Ok. Are you going to respond to that PR or do you want me to handle it?
[09:02:39] <fnagel> I need to catch my train in about 30m
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Ok, we can start with datepicker.
[09:03:02] <fnagel> nice
[09:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> The datepicker branch has been rebased.
[09:03:17] <fnagel> And I alreadz rebased the PR
[09:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> I reviewed that PR (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1432) yesterday
[09:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> For the most part it looks good, just some cleanup to do.
[09:04:10] <fnagel> Not sure if I will manage to fix your comments as my vacation starts tomorrow evening
[09:05:02] <fnagel> Yeah, seems like a bunch of no brainers. I wil do this asap after my vacation
[09:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> How long is your vacation?
[09:06:00] <fnagel> one week, so I will miss the next dev meeting
[09:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok, no problem
[09:06:21] <jzaefferer> here now
[09:08:04] <fnagel> I alreadz started with some neww fixes for $.date, mostly cleanup, CGL and remving of that selected property
[09:08:15] <jzaefferer> As for classes, arschmitz updated his branch, I'll review that soon
[09:08:31] <arschmitz> yup
[09:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Did you see all the a11y comments from Jon on the wiki?
[09:08:58] <arschmitz> and just a note on that it adds a qunit plugin for checking classes on elements, and i update ALL the ui tests to use it
[09:09:06] <fnagel> yes, but I havenÂ´t had time to dig into it
[09:09:12] <arschmitz> so we are consistent
[09:09:36] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you already did that update?
[09:09:40] <arschmitz> yes
[09:10:18] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: I think should talk to the guy to discuss his changes. Are we sure his proposed keyboard changes are usable?
[09:10:26] <arschmitz> there were a lot of tests to update
[09:10:49] <arschmitz> but it exposed about a dozen places we were improperly using hasClass and is in tests too
[09:11:49] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: and: perhaps he is willing to give selectmeni a11y another try!
[09:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: He's active in WAI-PF, so I'm sure his comments are correct.
[09:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll send an email introducing you.
[09:13:05] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Ahh nice to know, thanks for the info
[09:13:13] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: good idea! Thanks again
[09:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, back to classes and button.
[09:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz, jzaefferer: Is there anything else to discuss about those today?
[09:14:48] <arschmitz> nothing on classes i know of one thing on button though
[09:15:58] <arschmitz> wanted to know how people felt about in addition to the theme changes already made we snug up the left right padding on buttons a little http://view.jqueryui.com/button-classes/demos/button/icons.html
[09:16:32] <arschmitz> combined with the changes we talked about before with icons it dramaticly reduces the complexity and amount of css for buttons
[09:16:43] <arschmitz> and i personally think it looks a little better
[09:17:28] <scott_gonzalez> Those look really tight to me. Buttons usually have much more padding on them.
[09:17:45] <arschmitz> only the left and right is change not the top and bottom thats the same
[09:17:46] <jzaefferer> looks odd to have more padding next to an icon
[09:20:20] <arschmitz> im sure we can tweak some but the basic idea is we are no longer actually positioning the icons
[09:20:30] <arschmitz> they are just in the flow of the content inside the button
[09:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> Are you talking about the padding on the icon or on the button?
[09:23:43] <arschmitz> the only padding that changed there is the left and right on the button which was there to account for the absolute positioning of the icon
[09:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's the padding that I think is too small now.
[09:24:26] <arschmitz> The icon just takes up as much space as how big it is now
[09:25:26] <arschmitz> this is how most other css frameworks do it including bootstrap
[09:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> Bootstrap buttons have more padding.
[09:26:44] <arschmitz> right like i said we can tweak the actual look of the button
[09:27:05] <jzaefferer> having inline icons sounds fine to me
[09:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> I think what you asked and what you meant to ask are very different things.
[09:27:33] <arschmitz> this means we wont have any sort fo position classes like ui-icon-primary or ui-icon-begining
[09:27:36] <jzaefferer> can you update it to make the padding consistent between icons and non-icons? then we can take a look again
[09:27:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it is consistent there
[09:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> You asked how we felt about snugging up the padding.
[09:28:11] <arschmitz> sorry there were 2 questions
[09:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like you wanted to ask how we felt about a change to the icons.
[09:28:26] <arschmitz> snugging up the padding and removing all positioning
[09:28:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you and jzaefferer had both said you didnt like the padding
[09:28:57] <arschmitz> so i had said thats fine we can tweak that
[09:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we already had agreement to remove the positioning and just use placemente in the DOM.
[09:29:09] <fnagel> Ok guys, I need to leave. Bye!
[09:29:11] <arschmitz> not all positioning
[09:29:11] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looking at the second button on that page, labelled "Button with icon on the left", it looks like there's (much) more padding on the left than on the right. That looks wrong
[09:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> Have fun fnagel!
[09:29:21] <jzaefferer> fnagel: have a good vacation!
[09:29:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: there is not its .4em all sides
[09:30:36] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its because the visual icon is smaller then the actual icon
[09:30:43] <arschmitz> if that makes sense
[09:30:56] <jzaefferer> it does, and I don't like it
[09:31:20] <jzaefferer> I don't care how the visual space is distributed across elements, it looks inconsistent
[09:31:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i think that would involve actually changing the icons
[09:32:17] <jzaefferer> well, its not a problem when you have more padding to begin with, e.g. http://jqueryui.com/button/#icons
[09:32:29] <arschmitz> then you have to position the icons
[09:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> You should just use better icons in that page.
[09:32:54] <scott_gonzalez> The down arrow is bad because it's small.
[09:33:14] <arschmitz> i can change them to whatever you think shows a better representation
[09:33:35] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, that's not the problem.
[09:33:40] <jzaefferer> bootstrap docs don't have buttons with icons - do you haven an example at hand with boostrap or some other css framework?
[09:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> Changing the icon makes it look even worse.
[09:33:59] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yes they do http://getbootstrap.com/components/
[09:34:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: the problem is other frameworks that do this
[09:34:13] <arschmitz> use much bigger icons
[09:34:21] <arschmitz> that take up the whole visual spave
[09:34:22] <arschmitz> space
[09:34:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns
[09:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's not the problem.
[09:35:08] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez adding additional padding to the buttons actually makes this worse
[09:35:17] <scott_gonzalez> Change the button with icon on the left to use the gear icon.
[09:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> Look at how bad it looks.
[09:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty much on top of text text.
[09:35:44] <fnagel> Ok, guys, I need to leave. Bye
[09:36:01] <arschmitz> heh i know the problem
[09:36:03] <arschmitz> and its dumb
[09:36:09] <arschmitz> the space is missing
[09:36:15] <arschmitz> between the icon and the text
[09:36:27] <arschmitz> add a space and it looks much better
[09:37:32] <arschmitz> this is what bootstrap does as well
[09:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's easier for Bootstrap to do. How are you going to insert a space?
[09:38:03] <arschmitz> im not sure i was just thinking about that
[09:38:37] <arschmitz> well we have a label value you
[09:38:49] <arschmitz> we can always make sure it starts / ends with a space
[09:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's terrible.
[09:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> How are you handling label anyway?
[09:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's currently broken.
[09:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> Since you don't have an element to work with.
[09:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> Run this on that page: $( "button" ).button( "option", "label", "test" )
[09:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> Notice all the icons go away.
[09:40:25] <arschmitz> i just broke that today then
[09:40:27] <arschmitz> it did work
[09:40:51] <arschmitz> i had quickly updatedthings to be able to show this page this morning
[09:43:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/blob/button-classes/ui/button.js#L190
[09:44:06] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: but i feel like this is something we need to figure out to adopt chassis too
[09:44:29] <arschmitz> since its more then likely it will go with something like this since its what most modern frameworks are doing
[09:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> Right now I'm more concerned about the JS API and how the button looks.
[09:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm less concerned about the markup and CSS only buttons since that's gonig to be up in the air again as soon as we switch to Chassis.
[09:47:48] <arschmitz> i have not suggested to change the api
[09:47:56] <arschmitz> this is about implementation
[09:48:03] <arschmitz> is it not?
[09:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, I'm saying I'm not too concerned about implementation changing.
[09:49:53] <arschmitz> im confused
[09:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like we keep having discussions about changing the implementation details.
[09:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> I just want button done.
[09:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> Because the details may change again anyway with Chassis.
[09:53:29] <arschmitz> ok so what would you like for the icons then?
[09:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> Let's discuss later in -dev.
[09:54:19] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> TJ fixed the dialog overflow/resize handle problem that we discussed last week.
[09:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll finally have popup-type elements working properly in dialogs.
[09:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything that needs to be discussed about CSS dependencies?
[09:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> We haev 5 minutes left.
[09:55:35] <rxaviers> I have some updates...
[09:55:41] <rxaviers> I've updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1440 based on the CSS dependency list of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1440#issuecomment-72333462 (note it includes its subsequent reviews).
[09:55:45] <rxaviers> The update itself is quite trivial.
[09:55:49] <rxaviers> The exciting part is that I got a good progress implementing the builder.
[09:55:53] <rxaviers> The initial idea was to re-use gseguin's https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder. It's a complete NodeJS service you can deploy somewhere and build bundles. So, we would kinda hack it and use the necessary parts that would help on building the CSS bundle given the css-dependency-comments of our amd-modular-JSes.
[09:55:57] <rxaviers> gseguin made some restructuring (decoupled some functions there) to help making that possible. Although it did help (thanks gseguin), ideally I was looking for a buildCss( <pass-my-JS-with-css-comments> ) module.
[09:56:01] <rxaviers> Also, there's the fact that r.js uses the filesystem to perform the bundle optimization, which is not optimal for on-the-fly generation like we do on Download Builder. When I used r.js to support UI 1.11, I had hacked r.js to perform such optimizations in-memory.
[09:56:05] <rxaviers> So...
[09:56:12] <rxaviers> I've created:
[09:56:12] <rxaviers> - https://github.com/rxaviers/requirejs-memfiles: Allow in-memory optimization.
[09:56:12] <rxaviers> - https://github.com/rxaviers/builder-amd-css: Builds CSS bunde on-the-fly using requirejs-memfiles + require-css "css!" plugin.
[09:56:12] <rxaviers> - https://github.com/rxaviers/builder-jquery-css: Builds CSS bundle on-the-fly given the css-dependency-comments we have on Mobile and UI.
[09:56:12] <rxaviers> And:
[09:56:14] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/256
[09:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like you've been busy :-)
[09:57:32] <rxaviers> yeap hehe
[09:58:13] <rxaviers> Basically, #256 is a PR to support 1.12.0 using CSS-comments
[09:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> Right, and it's still a WIP, so I guess we're good for now.
[09:58:52] <rxaviers> still
[09:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:59:32] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
