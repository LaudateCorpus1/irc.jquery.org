[13:00:37] <jzaefferer> yay, UI meeting
[13:00:43] <jzaefferer> And I'm there for once
[13:01:24] <rxaviers> is this the first big one with mobile guys?
[13:01:32] <jzaefferer> ping kborchers rxaviers gnarf tj_vantoll arschmitz uGoMobi gseguin - agenda here: http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda3
[13:01:43] <uGoMobi> hey all
[13:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf gseguin agcolom arschmitz kborchers mikesherov petersendidit_ rxaviers scottjehl__ tj_vantoll toddmparker uGoMobi
[13:01:47] <arschmitz> Hi
[13:02:02] <jzaefferer> guess I missed a few :-)
[13:02:06] <rxaviers> hello
[13:02:08] <tj_vantoll> yo
[13:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> So, this is our first combined meeting.
[13:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> We'll talk about the preliminary steps for the merge.
[13:03:10] <kborchers> hey
[13:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure a lot of the stuff on the agenda we could easily spend >1 hr on for each item.
[13:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> So this meeting will probably just get some discussions started, and we'll continue to discuss in -dev over the next week or so.
[13:04:52] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[13:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> First thing on the agenda is AMD support.
[13:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> This is actually a bit larger than what Mobile currently does.
[13:05:47] <mikesherov> hi
[13:05:59] <jzaefferer> larger?
[13:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> We'll want something that works with and without AMD.
[13:06:40] <scott_gonzalez> You should be able to grab a source file and have it Just Work™
[13:06:47] <jzaefferer> Unless that should live somewhere else, can we get that requirement on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/66995889/AMD-Support ?
[13:06:59] <jzaefferer> I guess I can just add that to the list
[13:07:06] <jzaefferer> AFTER I LOG IN
[13:07:18] <toddmparker> (on now, sorry for my mixup on times)
[13:07:30] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker
[13:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we'll want something from https://github.com/umdjs/umd
[13:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> But I haven't looked at that yet.
[13:08:16] <toddmparker> hi uGoMobi - just catching up. so the target is july 15?
[13:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> Who is the go-to person for jQuery plugins in node? Is that TJ?
[13:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin timmywil rwaldron: ^
[13:09:53] <rwaldron> ?
[13:09:53] <rwaldron> sorry, no idea
[13:09:56] <jzaefferer> toddmparker: who's the goto person for AMD in jQuery Mobile? I wonder if you considered using UMD
[13:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> I recall a recent ticket for core about use in node.
[13:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> Who did we consult?
[13:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> Domenic?
[13:10:47] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: gseguin is the one
[13:11:07] <gseguin> what 'd I do?
[13:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> We've got Domenic in http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13768
[13:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> Isaac in http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13566
[13:11:27] <uGoMobi> gseguin: AMD ^^
[13:11:45] <jzaefferer> gseguin: vs UMD. Did you consider that? If so, why didn't you use it?
[13:11:58] <gseguin> jzaefferer: no valid reason
[13:12:13] <gseguin> jzaefferer: did core use UMD ?
[13:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's because you don't expect people to use source files.
[13:12:24] <gseguin> jzaefferer: I probably followed what core did
[13:12:42] <gseguin> oh wait you guys are talking about the internal modules
[13:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> Core is UMD-like.
[13:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's obviously not pure AMD.
[13:12:59] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: oh really
[13:13:01] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't rely on define()
[13:13:06] <gseguin> then no valid reason
[13:13:11] <gseguin> we can change that
[13:13:35] <jzaefferer> core looks for define.jquery :/
[13:13:49] <gseguin> for the internal modules, since we don't expect users to use them as such we kept the wrapping to a minimum
[13:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Not anymore.
[13:14:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's figure out which UMD pattern to use and land that in all projects.
[13:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> We'll discuss the details of that later.
[13:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> Next up is Bower.
[13:15:45] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: alright, loop me in when that lands and I'll change jqm
[13:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: We'll make sure you're involved in the discussion about which pattern to use.
[13:16:11] <jzaefferer> both UI and Mobile are already "registered" in the bower registry. Whatever that means
[13:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so I'm not really sure what we need to do for that.
[13:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden or timmywil can probably help out there.
[13:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> I think Sizzle is registered by us.
[13:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/component.json
[13:17:04] <kborchers> that needs to be updated to bower.json
[13:18:08] <kborchers> what is our goal with UI on bower?
[13:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Ok, we'll need to document this as it's something we'll want for all projects.
[13:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> To get people to stop bitching?
[13:18:20] <kborchers> full build with default theme?
[13:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, heh
[13:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think it's full build and source files with default theme.
[13:19:03] <kborchers> oh and source?
[13:19:04] <timmywil> here
[13:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think the idea is that people will bower install jquery-ui and then use AMD to get the components they care about.
[13:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> SlexAxton: Is that correct?
[13:19:28] <kborchers> hmm
[13:19:38] <rxaviers> as far as I know, yeap pretty much that
[13:19:43] <kborchers> but when you bower install it's going to drop all of that source in your project
[13:19:44] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: +1, or a default build
[13:20:17] <johnbender> here
[13:20:21] <timmywil> kborchers: right, is there a ui build in the repo?
[13:20:26] <kborchers> nope
[13:20:47] <timmywil> ok, then it may be fine to build themselves?
[13:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> There can be if we need one.
[13:20:50] <rxaviers> kborchers, it does, but in a separate subdir. Bower is very close to git clone with version management.
[13:21:02] <kborchers> for work, we have a separate repo of just our built dist that we sync with bower
[13:21:37] <kborchers> because we don't want that in the source repo
[13:21:44] <kborchers> but probably just a personal pref thing
[13:22:03] <jzaefferer> well, that explain the lack of docs on publishing to bower. There is no actual publishing?
[13:22:08] <kborchers> nope
[13:22:11] <jzaefferer> It just makes a flat clone?
[13:22:21] <kborchers> you just update version in bower.json and tag and it clones
[13:22:44] <jzaefferer> Well, that's why http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/66995889/AMD-Support has this: Modify release script to replace @VERSION within ui/ files (not just dist/), commit and tag that along with the manifest files. Without this, using the ui/ files directly as AMD modules would lack the version info.
[13:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> Right, I think what SlexAxton said was we would just ship the source files as is (plus version replacement).
[13:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> And it'd be up to the user to do concat + min via a build step (likely through r.js).
[13:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is why I hate this stuff.
[13:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> There are a million different processes that people have.
[13:25:48] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: still doing a define.amd check: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/e53a91909061c7a7280a274990db179b94db81b6/src/exports.js#L15
[13:25:53] <kborchers> yeah … i guess that could work … we would just want a "How to use via Bower" section in the README or something
[13:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Isn't that required for AMD?
[13:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> That's not jQuery specific at all.
[13:27:34] <jzaefferer> looks like that: https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD#defineamd-property-
[09:28:38] <jzaefferer> Let's continue with Mobile Widgets?
[09:29:27] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, related to bower, another thing we'll probably want to discuss is whether or not we'll add a bower.json (or component.json) file to the project's root
[09:29:53] <rxaviers> and how we'll specify stuff in there. special attention to `main` field
[09:30:53] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: others already registered both UI and Mobile. Do you have any clue what that means for us?
[09:31:27] <rxaviers> mm, probably sindresorhus could help
[09:33:51] <rxaviers> i guess we'll have to either pick another registry name or they could revoke it and give it to us
[09:34:54] <johnbender> :/ netsplit?
[09:35:05] <kborchers> looked more like the jquery znc died
[09:35:15] <kborchers> suckers :P
[09:52:32] <jzaefferer> Taiwan?
[09:53:08] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i think so
[09:53:08] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah i think so … taipei
[09:53:26] <kborchers> arschmitz: get out of my head
[09:53:59] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i still cannt connect through znc
[10:06:53] <arschmitz> are people still here?
[10:07:34] * rxaviers is on standby
[10:08:24] <kborchers> i think we may be giving up unfortunately especially since the dev leads meeting is now so i'm sure they are in their meeting
[10:08:34] <arschmitz> ah ok
[10:09:23] <kborchers> we should probably just head back to -dev
[10:09:29] <arschmitz> cant even mute because the only op in here right now is gnarf
