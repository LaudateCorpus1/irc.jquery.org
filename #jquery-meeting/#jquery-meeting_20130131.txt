[08:00:46] * JamesMGreene watches the agenda being written
[08:02:25] <gnarf> speaking of agenda's
[08:02:35] <gnarf> jzaefferer: can you add me as a collab on that one? gnarf37@gmail
[08:03:47] <jzaefferer> gnarf: just added jquery-devs-team@googlegroups.com - that should give you access, too
[08:04:02] <gnarf> thanks
[08:04:17] <jzaefferer> okay, who else is here? scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin?
[08:04:23] <gnarf> Krinkle
[08:04:24] <jzaefferer> mikesherov?
[08:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> here
[08:04:41] <mikesherov> hi?
[08:04:42] <jzaefferer> rwaldron rworth?
[08:04:55] <rworth> hey
[08:04:57] <jzaefferer> Its the bi-weekly Testing Meeting!
[08:05:10] <jzaefferer> agenda: http://bit.ly/qunitci
[08:06:22] <jzaefferer> Here's a fun one: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/392
[08:06:22] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #392 by jaredwy (3w 1d ago): Issue #391 - Add explicit ordering of module names
[08:06:41] <jzaefferer> There's been a rather long discussion in https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/391
[08:06:41] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #391 by jaredwy (3w 1d ago): Modules can be out of order
[08:07:24] <jzaefferer> It seems like the PR is pretty sane. Just sort modules by name for the select, and leave everything else as is
[08:08:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any objections to that? If you ever use the module select anyway
[08:09:03] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[08:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> I never use that :-P
[08:09:21] <jzaefferer> 'course
[08:09:41] <gnarf> I think alpha sort makes sense there
[08:09:53] <gnarf> JamesMGreene was arguing against that by default tho?
[08:10:26] <JamesMGreene> I just assumed it was the default for a reason
[08:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> If it's gonna be sorted, it should be alpha.
[08:10:57] <JamesMGreene> e.g. perhaps jQuery wanted them in the module order because of their escalating depedencies as the tests go on
[08:11:04] <JamesMGreene> But it sounds like that probably isn't the case
[08:12:19] <gnarf> nah, alpha probably makes a bit more sense than "whatever-order-loaded-order"
[08:12:23] <gnarf> imo
[08:12:43] <JamesMGreene> Seems to be the popular opinion now and I'm fine with that
[08:12:46] <JamesMGreene> it definitely scales better
[08:12:59] <jzaefferer> Any opinions on this circular reference issue? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/397
[08:12:59] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #397 by amb26 (6d 9h ago): QUnit.equiv will erroneously declare that objects with circular references compare equal to those without
[08:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Escalating dependencies only matters for execution.
[08:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> Seems legit.
[08:14:34] <JamesMGreene> Understood
[08:14:40] <gnarf> jzaefferer: seems like a fixable bug
[08:14:48] <JamesMGreene> I was just thinking it was convenient for jQuery core
[08:15:18] <JamesMGreene> I think I was just wrong on that one. :-P
[08:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if you're filtering by module, you're at a point where you don't care about anything other than finding the specific module.
[08:15:28] <JamesMGreene> I'm good w/ alpha sort
[08:15:36] <JamesMGreene> True
[08:17:21] <jzaefferer> Regarding https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/395
[08:17:21] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #395 by jzaefferer (1w 3d ago): Fix test duration/runtime
[08:17:41] <jzaefferer> Our own tests for test are bad, though the feature itself seems to work fine in practice
[08:17:56] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/qunit/qunit.js#L1709 - if ( loop && a[i] !== b[i] || !loop && !innerEquiv( a[i], b[i] ) )
[08:17:59] <jzaefferer> since QUnit.done provides a `runtime` property, we should use that for invidiual tests as well
[08:19:30] <JamesMGreene> (and modules, please :))
[08:19:48] <jzaefferer> right
[08:20:08] <jzaefferer> well, that's the new QUnit stuff, I think.
[08:20:50] <jzaefferer> There are some updates about TestSwarm and BrowserStack in the agenda, but I don't really have something to discuss there. I'll probably meet with Timo again sometime next week, that works better then trying to get him here
[08:21:05] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: I lost track of what's going on with mergatron. What's the latest on that?
[08:21:30] <jzaefferer> gnarf: any idea what needs to happen to that line to fix the issue?
[08:21:44] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah, use that if instead --- writing a pull for it now
[08:22:04] <jzaefferer> gnarf: nice, thanks
[08:22:15] <JamesMGreene> I wanted to ask a quick question on the QUnit addons if we have time
[08:23:03] <jzaefferer> sure
[08:24:05] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: what's up with addons?
[08:24:46] <JamesMGreene> Does anyone have any opinions on making QUnit Composite (the subsuite loader) part of QUnit core?  Having it as an addon limits its flexibility (especially in combining it with other addons) and, IMO, just works strangely (uses asyncTests to represent the first level of subsuites, etc.)
[08:25:37] <jzaefferer> That's certainly an option
[08:25:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^
[08:25:46] <jzaefferer> Scott wrote the original version I think
[08:25:47] <JamesMGreene> I'm trying to get it working with the JUnitLogger addon and the only way I can really guarantee the correct logging is to add a hack property like `QUnit.executingComposite = true` to the page in question
[08:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see how making it not an addon changes anything.
[08:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> You still need additional API surface.
[08:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> If the API just needs to change, that's fine.
[08:26:59] <JamesMGreene> You can half get by by detecting if a testStart callback doesn't have a "module" property in its data object but then we also do allow users to write tests without modules, too, so that's not reliable
[08:27:33] <JamesMGreene> I would really like access to the runLoggingCallbacks methods to add a `suiteStart`/`suiteDone` event
[08:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> So perhaps that should just be exposed so all addons can leverage it.
[08:28:14] <jzaefferer> That'd be fine
[08:29:17] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: sorry, I'm MIA at the moment
[08:30:21] <gnarf> hrm jzaefferer there is a deeper issue here, there is another test asserting against my change :)
[08:30:32] <gnarf> i'll discuss after
[08:30:59] <jzaefferer> gnarf: okay
[08:31:17] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: can you look into adding/exposing whatever you need to keep the composite feature itself an addon?
[08:32:12] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, pretty sure it would just be the register/runCallbackLogging methods
[08:32:45] <JamesMGreene> Also: anyone know what's up with this bit? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/addons/composite/qunit-composite.js#L92-L97
[08:33:03] <jzaefferer> QUnit["stay-off-my-lawn"].registerCallback(...)?
[08:33:21] <JamesMGreene> Seems either (a) non-sensical, or (b) hasn't been updated to match QUnit's new use of class-based expansion/collapsing?
[08:33:38] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: yeah, that wasn't updated
[08:33:54] <jzaefferer> it probably works as-is, but should remove the class instead?
[08:35:07] <JamesMGreene> k, cuz right now it just prevents you from seeing the underlying tests altogether
[08:35:17] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: I've been hijacking the #jquery-dev channel for QUnit discussion. Want to continue this over there?
[08:35:22] <JamesMGreene> I fixed it in my local a while back but wanted to ask before sending a PR
[08:35:37] <jzaefferer> good
[08:35:46] <JamesMGreene> Sure
[08:36:08] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks everyone
[10:00:12] <agcolom> hello :-)
[10:01:07] <ajpiano> hi agcolo
[10:01:09] <ajpiano> m
[10:01:27] <ajpiano> hi scott_gonzalez gnarf DaveMethvin rworth danheberden etc
[10:01:40] <agcolom> hi ajpiano !
[10:01:51] <rworth> hey
[10:02:04] <ajpiano> just a quickie update from my end...... i still haven't had a chance to do learn this week... i got pulled onto a little mini project at work that i am finishing up today
[10:02:14] <RWhitbeck> hi
[10:02:26] <ajpiano> should be able to pivot onto it later today and  get it announced tomorrow
[10:02:27] <ajpiano> hi RWhitbeck
[10:02:39] <agcolom> fantastic!
[10:02:50] <rworth> I've got a stripe integration plugin for .org provided by Chris from League of Beards
[10:02:56] <ajpiano> rworth: wanna give a quick status update on .org
[10:02:56] <ajpiano> lol
[10:03:03] <rworth> I'm testing it out today, looking at Mon/Tue for launch
[10:03:12] <ajpiano> with the other content complete as well?
[10:03:14] <rworth> still content work today
[10:03:23] <ajpiano> ah ok
[10:03:33] <rworth> will be doing that today tomorrow and Sat now that I have some client work out of the way
[10:04:21] <kswedberg> hi guys
[10:04:51] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: agcolom care to give a quick update on what's going on with mobile?
[10:05:08] <ajpiano> we should make a final decision on the resources url
[10:05:12] <ajpiano> whether to change it or not
[10:05:12] <RWhitbeck> We had a content strategy meeting with toddmparker this week.
[10:05:40] <RWhitbeck> so we're going to update teh content and relook at anything that needs to be changed updated.
[10:05:51] <RWhitbeck> I've started down that path by submitting issues.
[10:06:11] <RWhitbeck> the resources url is a tough one as we're struggling with what else to call it.
[10:06:18] <ajpiano> i don't think we need to change it
[10:06:26] <ajpiano> assuming it works, all that it is is "awkward"
[10:06:50] <RWhitbeck> I'd like to keep it as is and see if there is a ton of confusion on editing that file.  I suspect not as 90% of people who are going to edit it are aware.
[10:07:17] <RWhitbeck> plus 89% of statistics are made up
[10:07:58] <RWhitbeck> the download builder is in gseguin court and I'll help support him.
[10:08:17] <RWhitbeck> we'll need a plan for ThemeRoller.
[10:08:59] <RWhitbeck> we're targeting mid February but not sure how realistic that is with my travels next week and month.
[10:09:08] <agcolom> and I'm still working on the api site, but have been crazy busy with work this week...
[10:09:28] <ajpiano> i'd just assume leave themeroller alone and proxy to the old setup
[10:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, lunch ran late; I'm here now.
[10:10:17] <ajpiano> hi scott_gonzalez
[10:10:26] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano … I just help with that from someone.
[10:10:37] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: yes ofcourse
[10:10:55] <RWhitbeck> so I am looking for someone to own it.
[10:11:04] <agcolom> the good thing is RWhitbeck Todd and myself will be meeting in Feb in Vienna, so maybe we can discuss then any outstanding issue... maybe too late if we're still targeting mid feb
[10:11:19] <RWhitbeck> agcolom .. I won't be in vienna
[10:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: I've noticed that stripe is super slow.
[10:11:34] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: sorry! I thought you were :-(
[10:11:35] <rworth> scott_gonzalez oh?
[10:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> >1 second delays on page loads.
[10:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> So we should pull it out of plugins.js.
[10:11:49] <rworth> ok
[10:12:01] <RWhitbeck> agcolom I wish…family vacation that week
[10:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> It was especially bad the other day, but even on a normal day, there's a noticable lag.
[10:12:43] <ajpiano> yeah that type of thing definitely shouldn't be loading on every single page if it's needed on one page in the entire network
[10:13:06] <rworth> yup
[10:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Yeah, it was just the path of least resistence, and it's what we've been doing for all plugins so far.
[10:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> rworth did warn me that what he'd be adding was larger than everything we already had combined.
[10:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't realize it'd be making an additional 4 requests though.
[10:15:34] <gnarf> ajpiano: here, sorry
[10:15:54] <ajpiano> cool
[10:16:19] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: any objection to just leaving jquerymobile.com/resources where it is, since it does work
[10:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[10:17:04] <ajpiano> cool
[10:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> Like you said, it's just a bit awkward with the new URL structure.
[10:17:13] <gnarf> RWhitbeck / ajpiano: Any proxy stuff on mobile, just let me know what we need to proxy
[10:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> But it should work indefinitely.
[10:17:45] <gnarf> if it works, it works
[10:17:50] <RWhitbeck> gnarf ThemeRoller,  plus what ever gseguin needs for download builder.
[10:18:35] <gnarf>  /themeroller -> oldserver/themeroller and /amd-builder -> amd-builder.jquerymobile.com/amd-builder ?
[10:18:53] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano scott_gonzalez Great, I'll close that issue then.
[10:19:00] <gnarf> check with those urls, confirm, and I can add the proxies on stage
[10:19:28] <gseguin> gnarf: /amd-builder -> amd-builder.jquerymobile.com
[10:23:32] <ajpiano> alright well
[10:23:49] <ajpiano> once we get done with learn and .org, we can circle the wagons on what to attack next
[10:23:54] <ajpiano> but for now, i think that's all she wrote
[10:23:59] <ajpiano> see everyone back in -content
[10:24:28] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano agcolom and I plan to attack the jQuery Mobile section of learn in the coming days/weeks
[10:24:34] <ajpiano> that sounds great
[10:24:36] <agcolom> cool!
[10:24:58] <agcolom> :-)
[10:28:12] <agcolom> ajpiano: so you think you'll announce the learn site tomorrow?
[11:04:03] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:04:20] <Wilto> Nothin’ to add here; just listening in.
[11:04:23] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:04:24] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up. Give a shout if you're here
[11:04:30] <Wilto> Absent.
[11:04:55] <agcolom> here but will join properly in 20-30 min
[11:04:56] <gseguin> hiya
[11:05:03] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:05:20] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:05:37] <RThompson> just listening also
[11:05:45] <toddmparker> cool
[11:05:55] <toddmparker> 1.3.0 RC1 - Targeting Monday, just a few open issues we’re looking at
[11:06:05] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:06:30] <toddmparker> I'd like to have us stop making changes by tomorrow
[11:06:45] <toddmparker> but we can extend that to Sunday if needed
[11:06:57] <toddmparker> I'll work on the blog post with changes since beta
[11:07:18] <toddmparker> Since this is RC, we ideally will release this as final
[11:07:30] <toddmparker> so this is it
[11:07:44] <toddmparker> 1.3.0 Final - Targeting mid-February
[11:07:49] <toddmparker> API docs are almost 100% complete
[11:07:55] <toddmparker> Been focusing on creating widget pages for the new demo site, 70% of widgets are filled in, work starting on Q&A, demos have been cleaned up. Aiming to launch those with 1.3 final
[11:08:03] <toddmparker> Initial planning for 1.4 has started in the wiki
[11:08:15] <toddmparker> http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjquery%2Fjquery-mobile%2Fwiki%2F1.4-planning&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEKZbYxh26vTeCSu84xQLP7CR4ivg
[11:08:30] <toddmparker> (stupid Google)
[11:08:41] <toddmparker> Re-worked all the icon sprites for 1.3 to be consistent across sizes/colors. Added icon demos for how to remove the disc and use the black sprite
[11:08:48] <toddmparker> Ralph and Anne have been working on the new site and blog
[11:08:53] <toddmparker> WP7.8 device donations from Microsoft have come in, starting to distribute these out
[11:08:54] <toddmparker> RIM sent two BB10 test devices for the Boston lab, under NDA
[11:09:04] <toddmparker> </update>
[11:09:19] <johnbender> mine's short I can go next
[11:09:21] <toddmparker> any Q's on RC logistics?
[11:09:32] <johnbender> newp
[11:10:08] <johnbender> helped arschmitz a tiny tiny bit, fixed the bug in the automated testing on phantomjs (gseguin is aware in case it pops up later), and that's it :)
[11:10:25] <toddmparker> ok, so johnbender - once we get pencils down, you can do a build there
[11:10:41] <johnbender> yessir
[11:10:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: dont under estimate your self
[11:10:45] <toddmparker> easy peasy...
[11:10:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: maybe it would be good to huddle with someone and to a KT on the build
[11:11:10] <johnbender> s/to a/do a/
[11:11:16] <toddmparker> sure. be good to have coverage there
[11:11:19] <johnbender> gseguin: has keys I think but maybe someone else?
[11:11:31] <toddmparker> yeah…uGoMobi or arschmitz or jlembeck?
[11:11:33] <johnbender> anyone else have keys to the cdn?
[11:11:36] <arschmitz> i will
[11:11:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool, we can do a hangout and I'll show you what I do
[11:11:49] <arschmitz> help with or learn anything you want to show
[11:11:50] <toddmparker> not sure who has keys
[11:11:53] <toddmparker> nice
[11:11:53] <johnbender> it's not very complex :)
[11:12:08] <toddmparker> I'd like to listen in too
[11:12:13] <johnbender> toddmparker: well the prereq is that we can get keys for arschmitz
[11:12:16] <johnbender> otherwise there's no point
[11:12:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: ah ok cool
[11:12:21] <toddmparker> sure
[11:12:21] <gseguin> johnbender: wanna attend that hang out too as I'm going to try to bake that process in the build system
[11:12:22] <gnarf> johnbender/toddmparker: if someone needs keys, just tell me
[11:12:22] <johnbender> that would be good
[11:12:26] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[11:12:32] <johnbender> gnarf: cool
[11:12:38] <toddmparker> was just going to say that gnarf has the keys to the castle
[11:12:44] <arschmitz> lol
[11:12:47] <toddmparker> thanks gnarf
[11:13:16] <arschmitz> gnarf: your everywhere today lol
[11:13:20] <johnbender> who's next :)
[11:13:29] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: want to go?
[11:13:34] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:13:42] <toddmparker> google docs order today
[11:13:50] <uGoMobi> worked on panel...
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> fixed: “close when swipe on page” and take swipe direction into account
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5458
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> call positionPanel() when “updatelayout” is triggered
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> fixes: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5535
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> working on issue opening a panel when another is already open https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5510
[11:13:53] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5510 by uGoMobi (1w 2d ago): Opening a panel while another panel is already open
[11:13:54] <uGoMobi> add/removeClass timing issue (looking into best fix)
[11:13:54] <uGoMobi> updated panel API documentation
[11:13:58] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5535 by ivan-yu (5d 11h ago): Panel, if lengthened, causes touch event to focus on wrong control
[11:14:03] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5458 by luc-ass (2w 1d ago): New Panels not disappearing when swipe begins on actual page
[11:14:14] <uGoMobi> ty b-ot
[11:14:25] <uGoMobi> so 5510 still open
[11:14:27] <toddmparker> cool
[11:14:32] <uGoMobi> but I know the cause
[11:14:42] <toddmparker> thanks for cleaning up the demo page. much easier to see what's up
[11:14:43] <uGoMobi> and how to fix
[11:14:49] <uGoMobi> yw
[11:14:58] <uGoMobi> fixed textinput issues
[11:14:58] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5470
[11:14:58] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5447
[11:14:59] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5447 by gensenio (2w 2d ago): textinput('enable')  actually disables input field
[11:15:04] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5470 by nsbasic (2w 4h ago): Text Input has too much padding on the right
[11:15:17] <toddmparker> oh, the swipe to open panel demo seems to blink the page contents
[11:15:26] <uGoMobi> ohw :(
[11:15:31] <uGoMobi> what OS/browser?
[11:15:39] <toddmparker> but it looks ok in the panel docs
[11:15:44] <toddmparker> ios6, iphone5
[11:16:07] <toddmparker> at least it did this morning
[11:16:25] <uGoMobi> ok will give that a look
[11:16:26] <toddmparker> swipe to open left and it blinks on complete
[11:16:34] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:16:38] <toddmparker> closing ok and right panel too
[11:16:45] <uGoMobi> didn't see it on iPad with iOS6
[11:16:52] <toddmparker> I didn't have a chance to play around
[11:17:03] <toddmparker> and see if changing the transition would help, etc.
[11:17:04] <uGoMobi> ok something to look into
[11:17:09] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:17:16] <uGoMobi> added grid listview demo http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/grid-listview/index.html
[11:17:16] <uGoMobi> fixed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956
[11:17:16] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #4956 by vpxavier (4mon 3w ago): Demo: Tile layout for list items
[11:17:16] <toddmparker> yeah, no biggie. it's a demo
[11:17:45] <uGoMobi> added “panel open with swipe” and “listview autodividers selector” demos
[11:18:09] <uGoMobi> added classes “ui-icon-alt” and “ui-icon-nodisc” to theme CSS (easy to have diff icon color or no bg color)
[11:18:13] <toddmparker> that looks great
[11:18:17] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/grid-listview/grid-listview-demo.html
[11:18:23] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:18:27] <toddmparker> den meaning to look at it on my laptop
[11:19:00] <toddmparker> sweet
[11:19:17] <uGoMobi> and triage and some other smaller fixes
[11:19:21] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[11:19:23] <_|Nix|_> OK ... jquerymobile.com seems to be down ...
[11:19:24] <toddmparker> so you're just looking at that panel issue
[11:19:29] <toddmparker> yikes
[11:19:30] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:19:43] <toddmparker> works for me
[11:19:43] <uGoMobi> yeah doesn't load here either
[11:19:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: works for me
[11:19:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you break it already? ;)
[11:20:00] <toddmparker> we decided to shut europe out
[11:20:01] <uGoMobi> or don't have keys yet
[11:20:04] <uGoMobi> aha
[11:20:05] <toddmparker> you didn't get the memo?
[11:20:11] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Well, that demo link just kept saying Waiting for jquerymobile.com ...
[11:20:13] <arschmitz> lol
[11:20:17] <uGoMobi> nah probably "eyes only"
[11:20:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The front page works but http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/grid-listview/grid-listview-demo.html does not.
[11:20:28] <arschmitz> yup i decided jquery mobile is north america only now
[11:20:40] <toddmparker> Boston only
[11:20:41] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah true, same here
[11:20:47] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I get 502 Bad Gateway
[11:21:01] <toddmparker> seemed like we were having can issues…that right johnbender
[11:21:05] <_|Nix|_> Yep, me too.
[11:21:18] <toddmparker> or gnarf ^^
[11:21:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: cdn?
[11:21:28] <johnbender> yah
[11:21:35] <johnbender> gnarf: sent an email
[11:21:37] <uGoMobi> I noticed latest wasn't updated either
[11:21:38] <_|Nix|_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/ results in 502
[11:21:47] <johnbender> ...
[11:21:52] <uGoMobi> well... i really added that demo :)
[11:21:53] <_|Nix|_> It's back now.
[11:22:00] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:22:33] <toddmparker> well, our hosting
[11:22:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Very nice!
[11:22:41] <uGoMobi> thanks _|Nix|_
[11:22:47] <gseguin> it is nice indeed!
[11:22:48] <toddmparker> suuuure you did uGoMobi
[11:22:54] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:23:14] <arschmitz> i was having trouble this morning too
[11:23:18] <toddmparker> like the transitions
[11:23:19] <arschmitz> but it came back after a min
[11:23:23] <uGoMobi> want to talk about it arschmitz ?
[11:23:35] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:24:05] <toddmparker> great, thanks uGoMobi
[11:24:14] <toddmparker> oh, and I'm working on tidying up the test lab
[11:24:25] <toddmparker> i'm setting aside drives to ship out to y'all
[11:24:43] <toddmparker> I have a few extra BB phones, play books, webos
[11:24:56] <toddmparker> and of course WP7.5/8
[11:25:04] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:25:17] <toddmparker> so ask me before buying anything!
[11:26:00] <toddmparker> ok, _|Nix|_ is next in the doc
[11:26:10] <toddmparker> (skipping agcolom for now)
[11:26:23] <agcolom> I'm here
[11:26:25] <_|Nix|_> Got it.
[11:26:36] <agcolom> can go after _|Nix|_
[11:26:50] <_|Nix|_> So, I fixed two related popup foucs/reposition bugs.
[11:26:51] <toddmparker> ok
[11:27:10] <_|Nix|_> Reposition with keyboard open should be more solid now.
[11:27:17] <toddmparker> just tested the popups _|Nix|_ and they seem a lot better
[11:27:22] <_|Nix|_> Or, rather, orientationchange.
[11:27:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Glad to hear that.
[11:27:39] <_|Nix|_> ... and the jump-upon-open should be gone.
[11:27:47] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately, it comes at a price.
[11:27:58] <_|Nix|_> I had to introduce a second setTimeout :(
[11:28:05] <toddmparker> yeah, form popups work waaay better in iOS6
[11:28:22] <_|Nix|_> It basically ignores resize events for one whole second.
[11:28:30] <toddmparker> he who has a better solution, cast the first stone
[11:28:34] <toddmparker> woah
[11:28:40] <toddmparker> long time
[11:28:51] <_|Nix|_> The second starts when the popup opens, when you focus on something, and when an orientationchange has finished.
[11:28:52] <arschmitz> thats a brutal timeout
[11:29:15] <toddmparker> is this across all devices or did you scope it to iOS
[11:29:23] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but it's fine, because it usually takes the user that long to start doing something after an onslaught of visuals.
[11:29:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Android was bad too.
[11:29:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There was an infinite event loop.
[11:29:54] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: one thing I just noticed on the form popup demo is if i tap out to close the popup, the keyboard stays open
[11:29:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... when switching to landscape with the keyboard open.
[11:30:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that was crazy
[11:30:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hmmmm ... interesting. I might want to relinquish focus upon close.
[11:30:33] <toddmparker> yeppers
[11:30:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Give focus to the page or something.
[11:30:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll make a note.
[11:30:48] <toddmparker> ideally, back to the element that opened it
[11:31:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I don't have that information.
[11:31:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Besides, that might cause a jump.
[11:31:43] <toddmparker> wouldn't it cause a jump no matter what
[11:31:50] <toddmparker> if you focus the page for example
[11:32:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, if it does, I'll find something else.
[11:32:12] <toddmparker> or bounce to the element right before or after the popup in the source?
[11:32:21] <toddmparker> ok _|Nix|_
[11:32:31] <toddmparker> but this feels great
[11:32:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, definitely. Much quieter.
[11:33:01] <toddmparker> mind adding an issue to look at more refined ways to handle re-position? right now, we switch to window
[11:33:15] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that ...
[11:33:15] <toddmparker> but it would be nice to see if we can handle that better in the future
[11:33:25] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[11:33:39] <toddmparker> or you just re-position to the original target
[11:33:52] <toddmparker> think the concern was that it might be out of view
[11:34:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[11:34:37] <toddmparker> those new demos you're working on will be super cool btw
[11:34:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I hope I can squeeze them in before RC.
[11:34:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Does the freeze apply to demos as well as the library?
[11:35:15] <toddmparker> so do you have any outstanding 1.3 issues other than that form issue I just mentioned?
[11:35:25] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ - if not, not worries
[11:35:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Nope.
[11:35:32] <toddmparker> we can add those right up to final
[11:35:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, great!
[11:35:47] <toddmparker> we just can't change the library after RC (ideally)
[11:35:57] <toddmparker> we can work on demos right up to final
[11:36:06] <toddmparker> because those aren't lib code
[11:36:24] <toddmparker> so we have ~2 weeks
[11:36:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. Great!
[11:36:36] <toddmparker> i still have a bunch of widgets to port over, etc.
[11:36:48] <toddmparker> but let's button up 1.3 for RC today/tomorrow
[11:37:03] <toddmparker> then we can focus on demos and 1.4 planning as we wait for final
[11:37:05] <_|Nix|_> I thinkn that's about it. If those demos ever make it into the lib, that'll be another two pieces of web-ui-fw integrated :)
[11:37:12] <toddmparker> yep
[11:37:45] <toddmparker> is there a list view sort tool in web-ui-fw?
[11:37:53] <toddmparker> that would be cool to think about for 1.5
[11:38:09] <toddmparker> i get ahead of myself
[11:38:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I don't think so. Autodividers was in there.
[11:38:24] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:38:28] <toddmparker> anything else or should agcolom go ahead?
[11:38:34] <_|Nix|_> I'm done.
[11:38:40] <_|Nix|_> Like dinner.
[11:38:48] <agcolom> ok, so here I am:  api doc: added the examples for the filter-reveal listview options (listviewbeforefilter and data-filter-reveal) but still need to add it to the listview list of options
[11:39:00] <uGoMobi> we can do an auto sort demo... code is here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5136
[11:39:00] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5136 by david33409 (3mon 3w ago): Autodividers not sorting properly after adding dynamic content
[11:39:06] <agcolom> (so not much... been v busy with work+studies)
[11:39:21] <agcolom> also started a google doc to check what still needs to be done for the api docs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vo_O-GVATYLbo1WggLjlGAQGuFzwE3fUP_8ZR7aftE0/edit
[11:39:53] <toddmparker> agcolom: great!
[11:40:12] <toddmparker> we still have ~2 weeks to try and get API at 100%
[11:40:14] <agcolom> I've not filled in the boxes yet. I'd like someone to let me know in there if there are things that should not be documented...
[11:40:33] <toddmparker> i'd like to switch to the new site, api, demos with 1.3 if we can
[11:40:38] <toddmparker> lots of moving parts there
[11:40:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I've been speaking to a person named Hyunsook who will be doing the docs for web-ui-fw. I told her that you were the expert on documentation and that she should approach you if she has any questions. I hope that's OK with you.
[11:40:54] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Sure, that's great :-)
[11:41:09] <agcolom> move with 1.3 : yes
[11:41:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I don't exactly know how you get from the XML to the awesome-looking API site. I just know how to edit the XML.
[11:41:18] <toddmparker> it'll be great to have you back agcolom - you've been heads down in API-land for 8 months now
[11:41:25] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: all the magic is automatic :-)
[11:41:45] <agcolom> the XSLT file does the transformation :-)
[11:41:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: automagic
[11:41:55] <agcolom> yes!
[11:42:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Awesome! Thanks a lot!
[11:42:35] <agcolom> yes, it will be refreshing to go back to some triage and testing at some point, but I'm enjoying the docs as well
[11:43:15] <toddmparker> agcolom: i need to tweet those two learn articles you wrote
[11:43:22] <agcolom> so that's it from me... Will be talking at Vienna about good UI design principles with jQuery Mobile
[11:43:41] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes, we can do that after adam announces the learn site tomorrow
[11:43:42] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:43:46] <gseguin> cool!
[11:44:17] <toddmparker> ok, so I should keep it on the down-low for now
[11:44:40] <agcolom> and I'm so happy my question to Wilto was picked by the .net Magazine!
[11:44:46] <toddmparker> yeah, congrats
[11:44:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Sorry, one more thing: Should I cherry-pick those bug fixes to 1.2-stable?
[11:44:53] <Wilto> PR++
[11:45:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The focus/reposition ones?
[11:45:45] <agcolom> Wilto: yes, and let's see if you get some FF phones next week...
[11:45:47] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yes please
[11:45:54] <toddmparker> agcolom: hope so!
[11:46:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[11:46:02] <Wilto> That too, yeah. Psyched to check those things out.
[11:46:03] <toddmparker> we can nudge if not…remind me
[11:46:18] <Wilto> Their docs are really interesting.
[11:46:43] <toddmparker> oh, i'm planning on going to the austin jQ conf in September…be fun if we can try to get together then to hack together…just keep that in mind.
[11:46:44] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, what's this about your mug showing up in a magazine?
[11:46:44] <Wilto> http://buildingfirefoxos.com/
[11:46:55] <toddmparker> I can't make Toronto or Portland
[11:47:05] <gseguin> oh bummer!
[11:47:06] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: I assume they just got me confused with Scott Jehl.
[11:47:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: :(
[11:47:41] <gseguin> is the rest of you all coming to Portland?
[11:47:49] <agcolom> I am
[11:47:50] <arschmitz> ill be in portland
[11:47:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I am.
[11:48:01] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck will be in portland i know
[11:48:22] <uGoMobi> me too
[11:48:45] <toddmparker> awesome that you can all go. You should carve out some team time
[11:48:55] <toddmparker> i can be a talking head via hangout
[11:49:03] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:49:18] <arschmitz> there is wednesday for team meetings i imagine we will have some time then ?
[11:49:28] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:49:29] <_|Nix|_> Do you know what the format will be? Will it be like last october?
[11:49:32] <toddmparker> we have budget to do a team get together…need to give that some planning once things settle down
[11:49:39] <toddmparker> this month and next will be nuts
[11:49:47] <RThompson> sounds interesting
[11:49:48] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah
[11:49:53] <agcolom> btw, are we going to have a progress bar widget ?
[11:50:01] <toddmparker> RThompson: you going to PDX?
[11:50:31] <RThompson> if i can figure out some time sure
[11:50:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: There is a progress bar widget in web-ui-fw: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#progressbar-demo
[11:50:43] <gseguin> sorry I got us on a tangent
[11:50:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think portland is going to be a regular conf not a dev summit
[11:51:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK ...
[11:51:03] <gseguin> Can I go?
[11:51:05] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I love this!
[11:51:11] <toddmparker> progress bar would be the easiest UI widget to port
[11:51:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: very true
[11:51:50] <toddmparker> if we did anything, we'd want to pick up the UI one for consistency
[11:51:57] <arschmitz> if we can combine cores for 1.4 like you have talked about you could pretty much just drop in
[11:52:06] <toddmparker> funny, it's just two divs anyway
[11:52:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK ... so I gotta prepare a talk then? I got invited.
[11:52:21] <toddmparker> arschmitz: true
[11:52:27] <toddmparker> except for theme class mapping
[11:52:38] <RThompson> toddmparker: pdx is that a conf?
[11:52:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah we could write an extension for that
[11:53:04] <arschmitz> change the default classes to be jqm ones
[11:53:25] <agcolom> It'll be good for stuff that takes a while to load (more than 4-5 s)
[11:53:35] <toddmparker> yep
[11:53:38] <arschmitz> then we would only have to maintain the extension and eave the actual widget to ui
[11:54:03] <toddmparker> sure, that is the thing we need to work out in 1.4 as we port over tabs…how can we centralize the code (ideally)
[11:54:25] <toddmparker> gseguin: you want to go?
[11:54:31] <gseguin> yeah!
[11:54:35] <arschmitz> hmm _|Nix|_ this gives me some ideas we should talk about
[11:54:39] <arschmitz> later
[11:54:41] <gseguin> Talked with Ralph about where the download builder would fit in the new website, we decided to make it should be part of it
[11:54:47] <gseguin> grunt, grunt, grunt! What’s working:
[11:55:34] <toddmparker> ok, so the download tool will live in the site repo? that what you mean?
[11:55:45] <gseguin> yep
[11:55:55] <gseguin> JS build with minification and sourcemap (yay!)
[11:56:05] <gseguin> CSS consolidation and minification
[11:56:06] <uGoMobi> great
[11:56:08] <gseguin> Zipping -> dist/jquery.mobile.zip
[11:56:19] <gseguin> Testing via QUnit/PhantomJS with XML reports output for CI
[11:56:25] <gseguin> Testing against any version of jQuery via --jquery flag (will rename to --jqueries) ie --jquery=1.7.3,1.8.0,git
[11:56:30] <toddmparker> cool
[11:56:32] <gseguin> Added ability to run a subset of suites via --units flag (will rename to --suites) ie --units=event,navigation
[11:56:40] <gseguin> Found a way to work around the PHP dependency for tests which means no more apache/php needed. The simple connect http server that comes built-in with grunt is enough. I’ve added a middleware to the connect server which intercepts request for /js/ and returns the built bundle. It also validates that our built jquery.mobile.js is working.
[11:57:00] <toddmparker> oh, i'd like you to connect with xavier on the download builder stuff to see if there are good places to collaborate/share with UI
[11:57:26] <gseguin> He recommended to use templating which I think is a great idea
[11:57:29] <gseguin> There are now 2 kinds of builds:
[11:57:29] <gseguin> grunt dist and grunt dist:release the :release flag will pick up the version from the package.json as opposed to the git SHA1 hash.
[11:57:42] <gseguin> Left to do:
[11:57:42] <gseguin> 2 main suite failures left that I might need help with:
[11:57:42] <gseguin> tests/unit/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-dialog-hash-key-tests.html
[11:57:45] <gseguin> tests/unit/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-tests.html
[11:57:50] <gseguin> leading to: 38/775 assertions failed (399454ms)
[11:57:50] <gseguin> deploy
[11:57:50] <gseguin> add a flag for theming
[11:57:50] <gseguin> cleanup target
[11:57:50] <gseguin> testswarm
[11:57:53] <gseguin> anything else?
[11:58:00] <toddmparker> good stuff…seems like you've had more time recently?
[11:58:06] <gseguin> yeah
[11:58:06] <Krinkle> Yes
[11:58:10] <toddmparker> cool
[11:58:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: dont forget the php includes for demos when you get to it
[11:58:21] <toddmparker> so you and xavier have been talking already?
[11:58:40] <gseguin> toddmparker: yes
[11:59:16] <toddmparker> nice
[11:59:20] <gseguin> arschmitz: I think we'll just replace /js/ by a pointer to the jquery.mobile.js
[11:59:37] <gseguin> arschmitz: when we copy the demo files
[11:59:38] <toddmparker> speaking of xavier, he wanted to connect with a mobile person re: themeroller
[11:59:52] <toddmparker> I'll see if jlembeck wants to help out there
[12:00:02] <toddmparker> but anyone else interested in working on TR?
[12:00:03] <jlembeck> reporting.
[12:00:17] <toddmparker> hey Jeff - I'll forward you an email re: that
[12:00:22] <jlembeck> awesome
[12:00:25] <toddmparker> since you already got some training
[12:00:32] <gseguin> johnbender: am I missing anything to reach parity with the current build system?
[12:00:58] <johnbender> gseguin: looking
[12:01:46] <johnbender> gseguin: sounds comprehensive to me :)
[12:01:53] <johnbender> we'll just have to find out I guess
[12:02:09] <gseguin> heh :)
[12:02:25] <gseguin> ok that's it for me
[12:02:43] <gseguin> I'm merging master in my branch on a regular basis
[12:03:05] <arschmitz> guess im next
[12:03:06] <gseguin> will be able to merge back into master anytime
[12:03:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: who are updating the TR now?
[12:03:31] <uGoMobi> I could work on that too if you want
[12:03:32] <toddmparker> xavier is
[12:04:09] <toddmparker> uGoMobi - if interested, be good to loop you in so we have you and Jeff on it for backup
[12:04:20] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds good
[12:04:22] <uGoMobi> count me in
[12:04:31] <toddmparker> I'd like to move towards supporting beta/RCs in TR so that will take a bit more work
[12:04:34] <toddmparker> cool
[12:05:24] <toddmparker> great…arschmitz?
[12:05:32] <agcolom> I'd like to add a checklist for TR then to know what needs updating when we have a new JQM release
[12:06:01] <agcolom> (I can do that)
[12:06:05] <uGoMobi> good idea to document that agcolom
[12:06:48] <gnarf> random thought
[12:06:52] <toddmparker> good idea
[12:07:05] <toddmparker> gnarl - sure...
[12:07:07] <gnarf> TR could be generated yeah?
[12:07:12] <toddmparker> *gnarf*
[12:07:30] <gnarf> toddmparker: i've actually added "gnarl" to highlights since the new version of mac os came out ;)
[12:07:34] <toddmparker> it's pretty automated already, yeah
[12:07:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:07:46] <toddmparker> DAMN YOU AUTO-CORRECT
[12:08:19] <gnarf> Like UI's just generates it inside download builder
[12:08:32] <gnarf> but its weird with CSS
[12:08:35] <gnarf> so yeah
[12:08:53] <toddmparker> it would be nice to better connect these
[12:08:55] <gnarf> but anyway, whatever "release change" you do on the website should also be able to add/remove versions from the download/roller yeah?
[12:09:09] <toddmparker> that would be ideal
[12:09:44] <toddmparker> whatever we can do to automate the process so when we tag, it pushes to the download builder and TR would be a huge timesaver
[12:10:02] <uGoMobi> with a qunit test to see if we broke something :)
[12:10:09] <toddmparker> any help on that appreciated
[12:10:11] <toddmparker> heh
[12:15:03] <toddmparker> ok, arschmitz - want to do a quick rundown?
[12:15:11] <arschmitz> sure
[12:15:33] <arschmitz> working on some nav changes consulting with johnbender on there
[12:15:57] <arschmitz> have one question for everyone on this todd and i thought of yesterday though
[12:16:45] <arschmitz> if a page is loaded and the hash is the id of a popup or panel should the popup or panel be opend after pagechange has completed in the same way it will scroll to an id?
[12:17:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Popup also has a pbc handler.
[12:17:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah this would not effect that
[12:18:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OH, NM.
[12:18:16] <arschmitz> this would only be if you load a page like options.html#popup
[12:18:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don'y think so.
[12:18:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Popups are not supposed to be deep-linkable.
[12:18:30] <arschmitz> should the popup be opened
[12:18:34] <arschmitz> or same goes for panel
[12:18:35] <uGoMobi> didn't we discuss this before?
[12:18:47] <arschmitz> not that i recall but not sure
[12:18:58] <uGoMobi> I think I remember we didn't want this behaviour
[12:19:07] <gseguin> no deeplinks for popups
[12:19:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it was before 1.2
[12:19:11] <arschmitz> it would be a way to auto open a panel or popup when loading a page
[12:19:14] <johnbender> unless we can come up with a central registry for that part of navigation I would say no
[12:19:14] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that makes the page load process too complicated.
[12:19:24] <johnbender> and since we're probably going to start pulling stuff out of there soon
[12:19:27] <johnbender> maybe we can just defer
[12:19:54] <johnbender> that is, this would require every widget that cares to play nice with regard to the hash
[12:20:04] <arschmitz> it could be something as simple as on pagechange $('#popup').popup('open');
[12:20:31] <johnbender> but that assumes that nothing else is going on the page that might "auto-open" for some other reason
[12:20:37] <johnbender> we could exclude that as a use case
[12:20:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not as simple. The hash could refer to a panel or a popup.
[12:20:46] <johnbender> but on load interactions can be tricky
[12:20:53] <arschmitz> thats easy to check
[12:20:57] <arschmitz> by the data reole
[12:21:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think it would be better if we did it the way johnbender says and have a central place to decide what we do with a URL.
[12:21:51] <toddmparker> that might be a nice idea to sketch out
[12:22:05] <toddmparker> (central registry)
[12:22:06] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: the less that's in the nav pot before we get to widgetizing the rest of it, the better
[12:22:17] <toddmparker> that is very true
[12:22:18] <johnbender> "the less"
[12:22:26] <johnbender> ugh
[12:22:29] <_|Nix|_> Amen.
[12:22:31] <johnbender> less things in the nav pot is better
[12:22:31] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:22:45] <toddmparker> if someone wanted to auto-open, it could be done with a bit of custom scripting
[12:23:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's absolutely true.
[12:23:29] <toddmparker> we can add the registry idea to the 1.4 wiki page then decide where it goes later
[12:24:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz: are you going to turn off ajax in the demos and such?
[12:24:36] <arschmitz> yeah talked to uGoMobi: about what we sketched out yesteray
[12:25:07] <arschmitz> i thinkwe should go forward with that and yes i can take care fo the changes
[12:25:26] <arschmitz> just need to figure out if any other pages besides swipe demos need it turned on
[12:25:36] <uGoMobi> we also have to do something with the relative path of the links in the nav menu
[12:26:12] <toddmparker> ok, great
[12:27:05] <gseguin> is that everyone?
[12:27:12] <arschmitz> i made faq pages for all the form questions
[12:27:14] <toddmparker> yep, think so
[12:27:26] <toddmparker> nice arschmitz
[12:27:38] <arschmitz> i think thats it besdies normal bugs and triage
[12:27:39] <toddmparker> i'll work on finishing the widgets with weekend
[12:27:42] <toddmparker> cool
[12:27:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did it work out with code highlighter?
[12:28:02] <toddmparker> you all are cranking, really nice to see the new demos and API coming together
[12:28:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: mostly i need to talk to you about some styling
[12:28:27] <toddmparker> we have a lot going on…be nice to get this all launched
[12:28:30] <uGoMobi> ok sure
[12:28:48] <toddmparker> any Q's from the community?
[12:30:08] <toddmparker> { crickets }
[12:30:13] <toddmparker> ok, thanks everyone!
