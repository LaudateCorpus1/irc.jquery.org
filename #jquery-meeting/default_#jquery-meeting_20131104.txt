[09:11:36] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 timmywil rwaldron m_gol mikesherov jaubourg markelog
[09:11:58] <gibson042> ready
[09:12:04] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[09:12:27] <DaveMethvin> i gotta stop traveling so much
[09:12:54] <DaveMethvin> thanks for keeping up some of the housekeeping gibson042
[09:13:15] <gibson042> np
[09:13:25] <DaveMethvin> dunno if anyone else is here?
[09:13:37] <DaveMethvin> saw a few people active earlier today
[09:13:54] <DaveMethvin> sounded like m_gol and jauborg were going to be in another meeting in amsterdam
[09:14:14] <DaveMethvin> but judging from the new tickets they're making progress :)
[09:14:20] <gibson042> that's for sure
[09:15:27] <DaveMethvin> okay, well let's see what's got to be done for the beta
[09:15:32] <DaveMethvin> i still would like to do that this week
[09:15:57] <DaveMethvin> prob friday because i'm traveling tomorrow thru thursday :(
[09:16:03] <gibson042> yeah, I think that's a good plan
[09:16:24] <DaveMethvin> what's our "best practice" for problems like the one with Opera and focus?
[09:16:30] <DaveMethvin> Opera 12 just doesn't seem to cooperate
[09:16:39] <DaveMethvin> so i want to skip it
[09:16:52] <DaveMethvin> honestly i want to drop doing unit tests but m_gol disagrees :)
[09:17:01] <gibson042> heh
[09:17:15] <DaveMethvin> i guess i can just sniff the UA
[09:17:22] <gibson042> This is one where we really want a soft failure
[09:17:44] <markelog> me too, it's pretty big in Russia, so i kinda have to disagree :-)
[09:17:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah i would like something other than "brilliant success" or "fail and make the tests red"
[09:18:27] <DaveMethvin> good thing we don't have a team member in china or they would insist we support ie6 forever! :)
[09:18:34] <markelog> )))))
[09:18:45] <gibson042> wait... we're not supporting IE6 forever?!? :D :D :D
[09:18:52] <DaveMethvin> i guess what I'll do for now is make the test succeed on Opera 12 by checking the UA
[09:19:39] <DaveMethvin> alrighty,  next
[09:20:03] <DaveMethvin> should we drop the sourcemap comment from the min file?
[09:20:23] <DaveMethvin> if we were to add it back, perhaps we shoudl go back to the simple "concat to the end" method
[09:20:59] <DaveMethvin> i am inclined to remove it for beta2 just to get people's attention
[09:21:01] <gibson042> I hate to say it, but the currently implementation of sourcemaps causes us more problems than it's worth
[09:21:10] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:21:34] <DaveMethvin> and as long as we support the broken impl nobody is listening
[09:21:53] <DaveMethvin> so that's where yanking it makes sense
[09:22:13] <DaveMethvin> and if you want support, take the file and concat the sourceMap comment
[09:23:07] <DaveMethvin> okay imma do that then, remove the comment
[09:24:35] <DaveMethvin> still need those ajax bugs worked on, maybe jaubourg can do that in amsterdam
[09:24:46] <DaveMethvin> i guess it's Miller Time there already
[09:24:58] <DaveMethvin> or Heineken Hour or whatever
[09:25:03] <gibson042> ja
[09:25:13] <markelog> not qoute, jorn give a talk to booking folks
[09:26:15] <DaveMethvin> so where is that Vagrant PR? seems like there are some open issues
[09:26:59] <DaveMethvin> i guess i'll put a comment on it and see if someone can summarize
[09:27:33] <gibson042> I'm hoping gnarf runs with the jQuery infrastructure side of it
[09:28:28] <DaveMethvin> having never used vagrant i'm not a good person to review it
[09:29:06] <DaveMethvin> we had someone last night volunteer to look at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14484 but i wasn't convinced he knew how to handle it
[09:29:19] <gnarf> i looked at that one
[09:29:28] <DaveMethvin> is it only % values
[09:29:30] <DaveMethvin> ?
[09:29:37] <gnarf> i like the idea of vagrant hosting for the tests
[09:29:43] <DaveMethvin> oj
[09:29:44] <DaveMethvin> oh
[09:29:47] <gibson042> gnarf+++
[09:30:00] <gnarf> it could also give you a dev environment with grunt/etc pre-installed
[09:30:04] <gnarf> might be worth doing
[09:30:04] <DaveMethvin> is the current pull okay or did we need to resolve some issues like the dns etc?
[09:30:07] <gibson042> ++
[09:30:22] <gibson042> I'd really like to see those resolved before accepting it
[09:31:47] <gibson042> a .box hosted by us and no resolution weirdness
[09:32:46] <DaveMethvin> who can move that vagrant one along then ... gnarf?
[09:33:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i'll keep an eye on it - it's not ready yet
[09:33:35] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:33:39] <gnarf> eric needs to update some things
[09:33:43] <gnarf> we discussed it at wordcamp
[09:33:53] <DaveMethvin> seems like a nifty idea
[09:34:29] <DaveMethvin> Also a bunch of data()-related tickets there that might be fixed in the same go-through ... anyone got time to look? rwaldron?
[09:34:45] <rwaldron> Sure
[09:35:07] <DaveMethvin> thanks, by thursday night if possible so we can do the beta ith them
[09:35:52] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin will do
[09:35:53] <DaveMethvin> i'll take the mutable event one, 14304
[09:36:20] <DaveMethvin> on 14484 i don't know if that's just because of it being a % value or a more general problem
[09:36:31] <gibson042> DaveMethvin I think 14304 is a noop
[09:36:55] <DaveMethvin> well we should preserve the one property, that's all
[09:37:09] <DaveMethvin> not the event in general
[09:37:38] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, i agree with you gibson042
[09:38:07] <DaveMethvin> if you grab the object there's no guarantee those properties won't change as the event propagates
[09:38:25] <gibson042> right
[09:38:51] <gibson042> the value is dependent upon where we are in the propagation path
[09:39:01] <gibson042> and indeterminate after propagation finishes
[09:39:35] <DaveMethvin> closed notabug
[09:40:28] <DaveMethvin> so how do you guys feel abut the commit messages? using the template like markelog mentioned would be an easy fix
[09:41:05] <gibson042> I think the jQuery UI format is a bit verbose, but consistency is more important so I'm for it
[09:41:53] <DaveMethvin> We could do a variant, i am mainly looking for consistency in our own repo
[09:42:06] <DaveMethvin> they have widgets for example so it makes sense to mention that up front
[09:43:10] <DaveMethvin> we don't have widgets and tho we do have subsystems a significant number of our changes seem to cross those subsystems
[09:43:38] <DaveMethvin> so "Event" or "Attributes" is a bit redundant perhaps when the files are already split that way?
[09:43:46] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[09:44:02] <DaveMethvin> this is that "hardest thing in CS" problem, naming things
[09:44:12] <gibson042> yeah
[09:44:44] <DaveMethvin> well we don't need to decide now but i figured we might want to weigh in since UI was coming up with their format
[09:44:58] <markelog> i think we should follow git convention, everything else is easy to agree upon
[09:45:19] <gibson042> I guess the first thing to decide is whether we match across repositories or use our own
[09:45:23] <gibson042> format
[09:46:27] <DaveMethvin> i have some thoughts, i'll add them on that pr
[09:46:33] <DaveMethvin> for example, "fix" vs "fixed"
[09:46:47] <DaveMethvin> and i dunno that the title from the ticket needs to be appended there
[09:47:01] <DaveMethvin> if it does, perhaps it should be in the longer desc and not the one-line title
[09:48:33] <DaveMethvin> like, do these clipped comments bother anyone else? http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/86caac.png
[09:48:49] <DaveMethvin> i really want to see a one line complete there
[09:48:56] <markelog> it drives me crazy :-)
[09:48:59] <DaveMethvin> and then the longer desc can say whatever
[09:49:02] <gibson042> I wouldn't mind them if ticket number came first, to always precede the break
[09:50:07] <DaveMethvin> okay well we should register our comments on that PR to see if we can change some minds
[09:50:11] <DaveMethvin> or go our own way :)
[09:50:34] <DaveMethvin> markelog is JSCS ready to go? seems like it was
[09:50:42] <markelog> it is
[09:50:52] <DaveMethvin> want to land it then?
[09:51:38] <markelog> but i send a couple PR's to the grunt task repo and they were landed
[09:51:51] <markelog> so i just need to remove couple workaround in this PR
[09:51:55] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:51:57] <markelog> because they are no longer needed
[09:52:15] <markelog> i will land it tomorrow
[09:52:20] <markelog> also
[09:52:31] <markelog> there is a CSP PR
[09:52:36] <DaveMethvin> don't know if you guys have seen eslint, looks like that might be worth a look for this kind of stuff
[09:52:54] <DaveMethvin> it's supposed to have pluggability for various additional rules
[09:53:02] <markelog> it is for jscs
[09:53:15] <markelog> it's just does not supported by the grunt task
[09:53:17] <markelog> but
[09:53:22] <markelog> i talked with jscs creator
[09:53:35] <markelog> and we agree that it should be just a rule for it
[09:53:49] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:54:06] <markelog> so i will send a JSCS PR for it
[09:54:14] <DaveMethvin> alrigh
[09:54:15] <DaveMethvin> t
[09:54:21] <markelog> so CSP pull
[09:54:25] <markelog> looks it ready too
[09:54:39] <DaveMethvin> ok let's do it
[09:54:50] <markelog> also
[09:54:53] <markelog> there is this PR
[09:54:54] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1405
[09:54:54] <b-ot> markelog: Pull request #1405 by sindresorhus (1w 2d ago): Add time-grunt and load-grunt-tasks
[09:55:13] <markelog> i think we could use time-grunt thing
[09:55:20] <markelog> but not sure about the other
[09:56:27] <DaveMethvin> what does the extra output buy us?
[09:57:22] <markelog> well, we are not a grunt plugin writers so, at best, it might help us optimize some task, make it more specific or something like that
[09:57:30] <DaveMethvin> the load-grunt-tasks seems like it could be useful in eliminating redundancy
[09:57:55] <markelog> by "optimize some task" i meant declaration of it
[09:59:16] <DaveMethvin> maybe show the timings as a debugging option? In general I like to keep the build output small
[09:59:23] <markelog> i damn
[09:59:38] <markelog> when i wrote "i think we could use time-grunt thing"
[09:59:47] <markelog> i meant "load-grunt-tasks"
[09:59:56] <DaveMethvin> oh good you agree with me! :)
[10:00:03] <DaveMethvin> and m_gol
[10:00:12] <markelog> yeah!
[10:00:14] <markelog> it's awesome
[10:00:24] <DaveMethvin> do you want to do that one then?
[10:00:27] <markelog> but i'm not sure about time-grunt
[10:00:42] <DaveMethvin> i don't think time-grunt is worth the extra output
[10:00:54] <markelog> okay
[10:01:59] <DaveMethvin> i fixed a couple of migrate things, got one error (from OPERA again) but it may be spurious so i'll recheck
[10:02:18] <DaveMethvin> the only thing left for migrate is whether and how to publish on bower
[10:02:54] <DaveMethvin> i'll talk to timmywil since he's doing that for the main core repo
[10:03:10] <markelog> btw, i will send PR about bower and grunt dependencies
[10:03:17] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:03:27] <DaveMethvin> did we get everything? we're out of time
[10:04:04] <DaveMethvin> let's say we did :) thanks guys! see you back in -dev
