[14:00:56] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time
[14:01:02] <geekman-rohit> Hey
[14:01:12] <sfrisk> hey
[14:01:20] <sfrisk> kristyjy!
[14:01:29] <sfrisk> not seeing anyone else in the channel
[14:01:43] <geekman-rohit> Oh shit.. we wanted to plan a bit today
[14:01:48] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:02:19] <sfrisk> although I've got a busy day at work today with lots of meetings, so availability is limitted today
[14:02:48] <geekman-rohit> Umm so I guess we should setup a doodle and choose a day for meeting when both kristy and Alex can join us
[14:02:56] <sfrisk> That sounds good
[14:03:02] <geekman-rohit> Day/time one meeting especially for planning
[14:03:07] <sfrisk> I was going to be like "If there was a non work time, that might be good
[14:03:10] <sfrisk> "
[14:03:30] <sfrisk> Do you want to be in charge of setting that up, and post the doodle in the "Where do we go from here" issue?
[14:03:41] <geekman-rohit> Sure
[14:04:35] <kristyjy> hello
[14:05:04] <geekman-rohit> Kristy is here
[14:05:23] <kristyjy> sorry it didn't do it's normal sound when you said my name
[14:05:29] <sfrisk> that's annoying
[14:06:46] <kristyjy> yeah so catching up.. so we should schedule a new time for the planning issue? Is that an issue in github?
[14:08:03] <geekman-rohit> Yep
[14:08:04] <sfrisk> we were planning on doing a full out "Let's come up with the chassis plan" meeting
[14:08:11] <sfrisk> harder to do it during this time slot because work
[14:08:14] <sfrisk> thus, doodle
[14:08:31] <kristyjy> cool sounds good
[14:09:38] <sfrisk> all right let's do that then
[14:09:46] <geekman-rohit> Sfrisk u should set it up.. coz since 3 of you are from maine
[14:09:49] <sfrisk> I think that meeting would also be good for discussing if we want to change the meeting time
[14:10:03] <sfrisk> what ET are good for you?
[14:10:04] <geekman-rohit> Its better the options are during hours possible to you guys
[14:10:43] <geekman-rohit> What time is it right now?
[14:10:47] <geekman-rohit> In et
[14:11:03] <sfrisk> 2:11
[14:11:10] <kristyjy> pm
[14:12:27] <geekman-rohit> So 4:30m to 10pm in ET is difficult
[14:12:47] <sfrisk> I could do a before work thing? Or we could have a sunday or saturday meeting
[14:12:54] <geekman-rohit> 4 30 pm* to 10 pm
[14:13:09] <kristyjy> a weekend could work
[14:13:09] <geekman-rohit> Anything that doesn't fall in that window.. is fine for me any day
[14:13:15] <geekman-rohit> Weekend would be great
[14:13:59] <sfrisk> This saturday is out for me - but I could do sunday
[14:14:44] <kristyjy> same
[14:18:36] <sfrisk> Okay, doodle for some sunday times then?
[14:18:58] <sfrisk> In the 9am - 1pm ET range, so it's not too early for us, but not to late for you
[14:21:15] <geekman-rohit> That is ideal time for me
[14:23:45] <sfrisk> okay then, put a doodle up then, and we'll figure out what times work best for people
[14:24:05] <sfrisk> that or we'll just say "let's meet at 10am ET" in #css-chassis?
[14:24:18] <sfrisk> and post the time/location/date up on the issue
[14:24:38] <geekman-rohit> 10am et is good for me on sunday
[14:24:48] <geekman-rohit> Problem with doodle site is u can just put 3 timings
[14:26:26] <sfrisk> I thought you could put more times than that
[14:26:32] <sfrisk> or we just was "10, 11, 12"
[14:26:36] <sfrisk> as the three time options
[14:28:03] <geekman-rohit> Yeah
[14:28:57] <geekman-rohit_> http://doodle.com/poll/sp7diqwavx4zagms
[14:29:28] <geekman-rohit> I hope it shows time in ET for u guys.. there was no option to set a default time zone
[14:29:54] <sfrisk> looks good here!
[14:29:57] <geekman-rohit> If it doesn't..u can change it manually on top right side of the widget
[14:30:01] <geekman-rohit> Okay
[14:31:07] <sfrisk> okay let's meet on Sunday then - we'll go with whatever the earliest time everyone can make it to
[14:31:15] <sfrisk> I'll post the time on the issue too
[14:31:45] <geekman-rohit> Ill post the link
[14:31:51] <geekman-rohit> And tag people
[14:31:58] <sfrisk> good
[14:32:06] <sfrisk> okay, I think that's it then for today
[14:32:54] <sfrisk> see everyone on Sunday
