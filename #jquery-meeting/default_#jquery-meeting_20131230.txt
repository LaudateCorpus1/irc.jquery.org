[09:02:35] <DaveMethvin> markelog m_gol rwaldron looks like it's gonna be a short/small meeting :)
[09:03:00] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:03:45] <DaveMethvin> okay, two people now!
[09:04:36] <DaveMethvin> so i'm updating the notes now
[09:06:45] <_markelog> Quick update on karma stuff
[09:06:48] <_markelog> This PR â€“ https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/235 is used as basis of the karma branch
[09:06:54] <_markelog> so i need to land it as soon as possible
[09:07:24] <_markelog> karma stuff almost ready, i'm only waiting for browserstack response
[09:07:35] <DaveMethvin> lgtm and yeah, let's get it landed before it goes stale
[09:08:25] <_markelog> DaveMethvin: could you send me a browserstack credentials?
[09:09:03] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if i have any ... not sure who was managing our acct maybe scott_gonzalez ?
[09:10:00] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: thoughts on this? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14657
[09:10:35] <gibson042> hmm, I think I missed that one
[09:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> _markelog: Just let me know which email address you want to use for the account.
[09:10:44] <DaveMethvin> or this one, although i suspect this is shimming issues http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14656
[09:11:34] <DaveMethvin> can you take a peek at those? dunno if they're a more general parsing issue or what
[09:12:01] <gibson042> I'm scared to touch 14656 right now, but am willing to take them both on for investigation at least
[09:12:18] <_markelog> scott_gonzalez: i think markelog@gmail.com would be fine for now
[09:12:25] <gibson042> if it's not shimming, then it may be wontfix
[09:12:49] <gibson042> because there's no reasonable way to pick out nonstandard element names from input selector strings
[09:13:01] <scott_gonzalez> _markelog: Check your email. You should be able to create an account for free now.
[09:13:26] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: that's fine if it's the case, better to resolve it before the rc
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> i think http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14655 and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14595 are IE11 bugs that we can't fix
[09:14:00] <_markelog> scott_gonzalez: it works! thank you
[09:14:09] <DaveMethvin> i think i see how to fix http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14623 so i will take that one
[09:16:16] <DaveMethvin> so is everyone okay with "Fixes" as we currently have in the guidelines? it's fine with me
[09:16:37] <DaveMethvin> now that we don't have to jam it all into 72 chars :)
[09:17:23] <_markelog> i could live with that
[09:17:48] <gibson042> it's a little weird to have different mood in the subject and body, but still understandable
[09:17:58] <DaveMethvin> now i just have to remember to do it
[09:18:42] <gibson042> weren't we going to add a commit template to the repo?
[09:19:05] <DaveMethvin> if we were being honest we should probably say "Hopefully fixes #1234" or "Half-ass fixes #1234"
[09:19:44] <_markelog>  :-)
[09:19:52] <gibson042> fixes #120, not that testswarm will reflect that :)
[09:20:02] <DaveMethvin> SO TRUE
[09:20:24] <DaveMethvin> i've been dragging my feet on the Migrate because i figured we might get feedback on the core release that could be dealt with in Migrate
[09:20:36] <DaveMethvin> plus it doesn't seem like much needed to be fixed there
[09:20:41] <DaveMethvin> but it will get out eventually
[09:21:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't see much else that needs to be done in new tix
[09:21:46] <DaveMethvin> any comments on open pull requests? I haven't been through them this week
[09:22:51] <DaveMethvin> on the proposed changes to Deferred/Callbacks i was thinking that we should come up with a plan to migrate to standard DOM Promise
[09:23:02] <DaveMethvin> and then adopt a shim for older browsers
[09:23:11] <_markelog> i could land 1.x-master reset thing
[09:23:23] <_markelog> i need to check it again first
[09:23:30] <DaveMethvin> oh that would be good _markelog
[09:23:34] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[09:23:59] <_markelog> DaveMethvin: so we will gonna do it?
[09:24:09] <_markelog> Promise stuff i mean?
[09:24:31] <DaveMethvin> i think so, this would be good stuff to discuss in person in San Diego
[09:25:01] <_markelog> yep, i think so too, but i thought you're against that
[09:25:10] <DaveMethvin> trying to turn our stuff into Promises/A+ just seems like a mess
[09:25:24] <DaveMethvin> i'd prefer to have a way we can use the std implementation
[09:25:48] <gibson042> I should probably land Krinkle|detached's https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1430 for .add optimizations... you good with that, DaveMethvin?
[09:25:50] <DaveMethvin> for example maybe $.xhr and $.jsonp would use it when they're not just facades on $.ajax
[09:26:05] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, that one did look good
[09:26:10] <DaveMethvin> so go for it gibson042
[09:27:22] <DaveMethvin> it just seems like changing $.Deferred behavior is not a good idea
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> when we define new interfaces we can fix some of those issues
[09:28:18] <DaveMethvin> for example, .always() gets different args on ajax and there's no way to know what you're getting
[09:29:33] <_markelog> yeah, we should be very careful approaching this issue
[09:29:47] <DaveMethvin> all error callbacks need to get an Error object as their first arg if we are going to catch errors
[09:29:58] <DaveMethvin> that's not the case for Deferred use, even internally
[09:30:03] <_markelog> although i doubt we could make everybody happy
[09:30:24] <DaveMethvin> well if we only do it for the new apis at least we aren't breaking old code
[09:30:37] <DaveMethvin> and we can even warn that $.xhr implemented through $.ajax has these limits
[09:30:54] <DaveMethvin> but when you go with the native impl it doesn't
[09:31:46] <_markelog> it's gonna be a long week in San Diego :-)
[09:31:52] <DaveMethvin> anyway i think this will be a big topic of discussion, yeah
[09:32:10] <DaveMethvin> but a new api does give us more flexibility in changing things
[09:32:32] <DaveMethvin> i am still not really happy about the DOM Promises stuff, they have left out several useful things
[09:32:35] <DaveMethvin> and punted
[09:32:42] <_markelog> almost everyone has they own idea how it should go on
[09:32:57] <_markelog> i wonder why we were ignored on that
[09:33:17] <_markelog> we have TC39 representative right?
[09:33:23] <DaveMethvin> the reason it hasn't been a big issue is that very smart people like Domenic are writing code with Promises/A+
[09:33:34] <DaveMethvin> but the average developer will get bitten a LOT by this
[09:33:51] <DaveMethvin> things like forgetting to have an explicit error handler and not knowing why something is failing
[09:34:25] <_markelog> that could be harmful, even Domenic admit that
[09:34:43] <DaveMethvin> and if the browser will handle that case it's less of a problem
[09:34:48] <DaveMethvin> but js libs can't do the right thing
[09:35:56] <DaveMethvin> okay, well like you say it's gonna be fun in San Diego
[09:36:06] <DaveMethvin> any other stuff you guys want to talk about?
[09:36:15] <DaveMethvin> i may not talk to you the rest of the year :)
[09:36:49] <gibson042> heh
[09:36:51] <gibson042> think I'm good
[09:36:54] <DaveMethvin> oh _markelog  yeah rwaldron  and wycats
[09:37:15] <_markelog> happy holidays you guys!
[09:37:24] <DaveMethvin> so we can bug rwaldron  in SD
[09:37:41] <DaveMethvin> alright, happy new year if i don't talk to you before then
[09:37:53] <DaveMethvin> and let's try to get everything wrapped up for an RC!
