[09:01:28] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:31] <kborchers> hi
[09:01:44] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> The two autocomplete tickets with lots of duplicates have (mostly) been addressed.
[09:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6642 was fixed by TJ
[09:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7434 has a PR from TJ that just needs some minor cleanup
[09:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did you reach out to Chris Coyier?
[09:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> re: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9505
[09:05:25] <arschmitz> i dont have an email for him i only found a contact form on his website which i filled out
[09:05:51] <arschmitz> if someone has an email it would probably get more attention then his contact form
[09:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> chriscoyier@gmail.com
[09:07:01] <arschmitz> i figured it would be something like that should have just tried it on the chance lol
[09:07:53] <arschmitz> other then that i have not done anything for button this week been trying to finish up stuff for mobile 1.4.3
[09:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Is there anything we need to discuss for selectmenu right now?
[09:09:47] <fnagel> JÃ¶rn and I tried to fix the aria issue, without success
[09:10:04] <fnagel> nothing to discuss at the moment in my opinion
[09:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I have been working on release-related stuff.
[09:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> We fixed publishing pre-releases on the CDN.
[09:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> We're also treating pre-releases the same as regular releases for the CDN now.
[09:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> So all the themes will be generated, not just base.
[09:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> We're also going to have pre-releases on download builder.
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully that will get us more people testing.
[09:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing we'll be ready for an RC next week, assuming we can figure something out for selectmenu ARIA.
[09:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that was a quick meeting :-)
[09:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
