[14:02:59] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time
[14:03:09] <sfrisk> kristjy, arschmitz, nashvail, geekman-rohit
[14:04:07] <kristyjy> hello
[14:04:36] <nashvail> hey!
[14:04:39] <sfrisk> agenda
[14:04:40] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:04:48] <sfrisk> I know geekman-rohit can't make it today, stuff came up
[14:07:18] <nashvail> I think we should add more general colors like black and white to the palette too
[14:07:20] <nashvail> ?
[14:08:45] <nashvail> I have updated the style guide with palette (visual) and Panels but I don't think panels are something we will be working on anytime soon so ignore that
[14:08:46] <sfrisk> I've been meaning to add a demo page for palette as well
[14:09:19] <sfrisk> first up is the buttons remove undelrine: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/166/files
[14:09:22] <sfrisk> it looks good to me
[14:09:36] <sfrisk> so unless anyone else sees anything, I'll pull it in after this meeting
[14:10:10] <sfrisk> Same with the grunt test stuff: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/158
[14:11:09] <kristyjy> button underline removal looks good to me
[14:12:21] <sfrisk> ok
[14:12:31] <sfrisk> so kristyjy I noticed you added that update to tables for 100% width table
[14:12:39] <kristyjy> yup
[14:12:59] <sfrisk> there is one fix in the meta name description for the demo page
[14:13:06] <sfrisk> it mentions "typography" not table
[14:13:31] <kristyjy> oh okay didn't notice that haha
[14:14:33] <sfrisk> considering the naming scheme for fullwidth - technically that's a modifier on table
[14:15:13] <sfrisk> the "-" is used for indicating the element the css class is targeting
[14:15:25] <sfrisk> so I'm almost wondering if we have .table.table-fullwidth instead
[14:15:30] <sfrisk> checking what we did for buttons
[14:16:16] <kristyjy> I thought I did it the way buttons did but maybe I overlooked something?
[14:16:43] <kristyjy> oh I get what you mean now.. nevermind
[14:18:06] <arschmitz> hi sorry here now
[14:18:11] <sfrisk> so "btn btn-default btn-xs"
[14:18:27] <sfrisk> so I think for a full width table, it probably should be "table table-full"
[14:19:03] <kristyjy> okay makes sense I wasn't thinking right about it lol
[14:21:03] <sfrisk> okay
[14:21:22] <sfrisk> :-)
[14:24:04] <sfrisk> Okay, now that the CLA issues have been resolved
[14:24:17] <nashvail> yes!
[14:24:30] <sfrisk> after this meeting I'll put inut/modal/notifications on their own branches so people can check them out on the views subdomain
[14:25:23] <nashvail> sounds great! We're not going to put panels on the views.. right?
[14:26:11] <sfrisk> I figured put it on hold for now - mostly because we do want to focus on phase 1 stuff
[14:26:18] <sfrisk> technically modal stuff is probably phase 2
[14:26:25] <sfrisk> notifications could be phase 1 if used with forms
[14:26:41] <arschmitz> dont both panel and modal require major input from frameworks also
[14:26:56] <sfrisk> they would require JavaScript to operate correctly
[14:27:08] <sfrisk> which is the goal for phase two stuff
[14:27:16] <arschmitz> right so input from implmentors seems like it would need to be one of the first steps
[14:27:47] <sfrisk> I kinda want to get the phase one stuff pretty solid first - but we could start letting peeps know in the various UI projects
[14:27:59] <nashvail> also if you take a look in the style guide there are these tooltips for validation, could that be something we should work on?
[14:28:01] <arschmitz> i just mean that its premature to be startin on them
[14:28:03] <sfrisk> to start getting input, especially on making sure things are stylistically accessible
[14:28:07] <arschmitz> until that input has been collected
[14:28:14] <sfrisk> definitely
[14:28:28] <arschmitz> and there is a lot to consider
[14:28:31] <sfrisk> true
[14:28:37] <arschmitz> like they can be resizable
[14:28:40] <arschmitz> draggable
[14:28:50] <arschmitz> which effects what types of styles are usable / make sense
[14:29:36] <sfrisk> okay then
[14:29:38] <nashvail> sfrisk the "definitely" was for the tooltips thing?
[14:29:44] <sfrisk> nope, agreeing with arschmitz
[14:29:54] <sfrisk> I think we could create issues for the phase two items
[14:30:08] <sfrisk> since technically those PRs don't have issues associated with them
[14:30:17] <nashvail> yes
[14:30:35] <sfrisk> that way we can document what exactly would need to be included for features for more complex components to start getting framework input
[14:30:48] <sfrisk> but we reallly should be focusing on phase one items that have been tagged in the issues
[14:34:18] <sfrisk> so I'll put inputs on a view branch, as well as notifications
[14:34:29] <sfrisk> although I think notifications might be useful as we see them working within a form
[14:34:38] <sfrisk> also, arschmitz, could you help with the accessibility testing merge?
[14:34:53] <arschmitz> sure
[14:35:43] <nashvail> The notifications as of now don't have a close button, that'll definitely require JavaScript to work but can we put it there like a placeholder or something?
[14:36:01] <sfrisk> I guess what was your intention for notifications
[14:36:07] <sfrisk> because I don't think we have a ticket associated for them
[14:36:39] <sfrisk> are the notifications related to form validation? or are they something that's just suppose to popup and be dismissible
[14:37:18] <nashvail> My intention was for alerts, alerts can be form validation alerts or successful login alerts you know
[14:38:07] <sfrisk> I would leave a close button out of them for now if they're just alerts that are non interactive for phase 1
[14:38:26] <sfrisk> for providing feedback on user action
[14:38:35] <nashvail> yes definitely
[14:38:48] <sfrisk> also we should probably create an issue for notifications/alerts
[14:39:03] <sfrisk> discussions sometimes get hidden in PRs
[14:39:18] <sfrisk> and it would be useful to have the ticket to document the different type of alerts that would be required for form validation
[14:39:41] <sfrisk> tehcnically we new have this ticket: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/9
[14:40:00] <sfrisk> so what you have I think qualifies as "Validation Notice Above Form"
[14:40:23] <nashvail> hey yes
[14:40:50] <sfrisk> so in that case, we would want to make sure demos show some multiline options - like listing errors/providing more information
[14:40:57] <sfrisk> make sure that it looks good with 1 line vs 6
[14:41:30] <nashvail> got it, since it's an alert there should be height limit right?
[14:41:47] <sfrisk> I'm not sure if you would want a height limit
[14:41:57] <sfrisk> that could cause problems in mobile
[14:42:24] <nashvail> So we leave it to the user to not fill the alert with a ton of content that takes up half of the viewport
[14:42:34] <sfrisk> or in forms that aren't very wide
[14:43:24] <sfrisk> form validation notices can be long or short
[14:44:58] <nashvail> Multiline demos coming in a few hours
[14:45:16] <nashvail> it's night here so...
[14:45:21] <sfrisk> so tomorrow sometime?
[14:45:37] <nashvail> yeah sure first thing tomorrow morning
[14:45:49] <nashvail> I'll update you
[14:46:09] <sfrisk> awesome
[14:46:14] <sfrisk> okay, I need to get back to work
[14:46:19] <sfrisk> I'll put the input stuff into views
[14:46:33] <sfrisk> and create tickets for the phase 2 stuff that has PRs open so we can start getting community input
[14:46:54] <nashvail> alright
[14:47:33] <sfrisk> okay
[14:47:40] <sfrisk> see everyone on the boards
