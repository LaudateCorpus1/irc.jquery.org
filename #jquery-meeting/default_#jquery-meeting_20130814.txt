[09:02:15] <kborchers> i have a conflicting meeting today so won't be around but can answer any questions later
[09:02:19] <kborchers> if there are any
[09:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you want to start with an update on AMD/download builder?
[09:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> I know you're waiting on PR reviews.
[09:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> Foundation work has pulled me even further away from UI, but I'm back on plugins site now.
[09:04:33] <rxaviers> hey scott sorry for the delay
[09:05:14] <rxaviers> sure, download builder now builds UMD wrapped files using requirejs
[09:05:53] <rxaviers> the build process is slower than before (when we simply concatenated files)
[09:06:24] <rxaviers> but, the build cache prevents this from being a problem, at least for common downloads
[09:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know where the slowdown is?
[09:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Is it calculating dependencies or building after the dependencies are known?
[09:07:30] <rxaviers> not precisely. But, requirejs calculates dependencies and does fancier things than concat. So, it makes sense to be slower.
[09:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like we could probably do some optimizing if we can get hooks into r.js and do some upfront parsing.
[09:07:53] <rxaviers> sure
[09:08:01] <rxaviers> we could help improve r.js upstream
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> What's the total download time for an uncached build on stage?
[09:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know yet?
[09:08:21] <rxaviers> let me check
[09:08:32] <rxaviers> yeap, I've made some local comparisons
[09:08:52] <rxaviers> what previously took 1.28s avg, now takes 3.92s avg
[09:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...4 seconds seems a bit long.
[09:09:15] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:09:28] <rxaviers> of course, after it's cached, it does to like ms
[09:09:32] <rxaviers> goes*
[09:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> right
[09:09:52] <rxaviers> the above measurement was averaged of 10x without cache
[09:10:14] <rxaviers> (only file in memory cache)
[09:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well we can start looking into optimizations now. Even though this is slow, I don't think we'll let this hold up the use of UMD or the release of 1.11.
[09:10:57] <rxaviers> ok
[09:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> So wherever we end up by the time we're ready to release is what we'll use and we can continue to look into optimizing after that if necessary.
[09:12:00] <rxaviers> On UI, we drop build task. We dont build there anyway. Although, there is this side effect https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/156#discussion_r5537546
[09:12:00] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #156 by rxaviers (2w 1d ago): AMD support
[09:12:32] <rxaviers> ops
[09:12:52] <rxaviers> wrong link..
[09:12:56] <rxaviers> this is what I mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029/#issuecomment-21969885
[09:12:57] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (4w 21h ago): AMD support
[09:13:04] <rxaviers> "The biggest cons of removing the build task is that we are not able to jshint the final output on each commit anymore. Therefore, it's hard to know whether variables among components might clash."
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to find ways to not have variables that can clash at all.
[09:14:43] <rxaviers> ok
[09:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's one of the things I'll look at when I'm done with the plugins site.
[09:15:29] <rxaviers> Scott, where do you think is the best place to document AMD usage? I think it would be useful to have an example of how to setup requirejs config, like setting jquery path.
[09:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> learn.jquery.com
[09:18:01] <rxaviers> where exactly? :P
[09:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> In the jQuery UI section. On a page that doesn't exist yet.
[09:18:30] <rxaviers> hm ok
[09:18:55] <rxaviers> ok thanks, that's all from my side. Any question on something?
[09:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. Thanks.
[09:19:16] <rxaviers> ;)
[09:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> Selectmenu is still waiting on me (first thing on UI I'll be looking at after the plugins site).
[09:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, rxaviers, anything else on CLDR?
[09:20:10] <rxaviers> nope
[09:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> And tj_vantoll, any update on datepicker?
[09:26:54] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
