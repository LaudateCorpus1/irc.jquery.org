[08:59:29] <timmywil> hi
[08:59:38] <ajpiano> hi
[08:59:43] <svizion> hi
[09:00:01] <ajpiano> so i got one trac e-mail this morning
[09:00:09] <ajpiano> but i don't think that means it's "fixed" per se
[09:00:33] <rwaldron> hi
[09:00:49] <rwaldron> that explains why i haven't seen a bug email in days
[09:01:03] <timmywil> danheberden: any new insights on trac?
[09:01:15] <mikesherov> .
[09:01:16] <bot-t> (16 hours 20 mins ago) <danheberden> tell mikesherov yes, your key has been added - and same username as irc
[09:01:32] <mikesherov> PRESENT
[09:01:39] <timmywil> hey mikesherov!
[09:01:43] <rwaldron> mikesherov is "presenting"
[09:02:03] <mikesherov> How's everyone doing today
[09:02:19] <rwaldron> I need to leave as soon as the meeting is over
[09:02:22] <timmywil> Is danheberden the best person to help with the emails?
[09:02:43] <timmywil> We can just add a note to talk to him about it later
[09:03:12] <danheberden> timmywil i just haven't had a chance to look into it yet
[09:03:49] <timmywil> danheberden: no worries, as long as someone is on it
[09:03:52] <mikesherov> so, in regards to trac, WTF
[09:04:04] <danheberden> mikesherov which part :(
[09:04:23] <mikesherov> So, couple of basic questions:
[09:04:30] <mikesherov> 1. is there a slow query log on the box?
[09:04:55] <mikesherov> If so, I have a feeling there is 1 or 2 custom reports that's just slowing the whole thing down
[09:05:13] <mikesherov> and I wonder if we could be doing more to optimize MySQL
[09:05:35] <danheberden> mikesherov possibly more - i spent some time with mysql which seemed to help a great deal
[09:05:48] <danheberden> but now there's problems with getting trac to run *not* as fcgi
[09:05:52] <danheberden> lemme share the dev doc for it
[09:05:58] <mikesherov> great, thanks
[09:06:13] <mikesherov> I'll collab with you out of this meeting to see what else can be done
[09:06:33] <timmywil> cool, so 1.7.2rc1
[09:06:43] <danheberden> mikesherov pm me your email?
[09:06:47] <timmywil> are there any tickets that are not marked 1.7.2 that we want to look at?
[09:06:59] <timmywil> otherwise, Dave will probably release
[09:07:22] <timmywil> there are currently none open in trac
[09:07:26] <mikesherov> Right
[09:07:44] <mikesherov> I mean, I would love to make 1.7.2 border-box compliant, but that's just a pipe dream
[09:07:54] <mikesherov> :-P
[09:07:56] <rwaldron> pet bugs
[09:08:04] <rwaldron> >:|
[09:08:49] <mikesherov> There's actually a significant one dealing with animation in border-box, but I'll spare you the details for this meeting
[09:09:03] <timmywil> that's alright. If anyone thinks of a bug, we can still get small things in, but anything significant will have to wait
[09:09:28] <timmywil> Are unit tests ok now? I didn't see anything after the ALL BLACK day
[09:09:56] <timmywil> ah yea, that's much better
[09:10:10] <mikesherov> Yeah, it was related to setTimeout and then include file
[09:10:11] <timmywil> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/18/
[09:11:02] <rwaldron> timmywil yeah, turns out jaubourg was concating with + instead of .
[09:11:05] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:11:08] <rwaldron> (in php)
[09:11:14] <timmywil> ah yea
[09:11:32] <timmywil> php :P
[09:11:36] <rwaldron> is dumb.
[09:11:47] <mikesherov> speak of the devil
[09:11:52] <jaubourg> hey
[09:11:57] <timmywil> hey there jaubourg !
[09:12:02] <jaubourg> sup guys?
[09:12:07] <jaubourg> :)
[09:12:07] <rwaldron> hey jaubourg sorry I missed you yesterday
[09:12:11] <rwaldron> you pinged "rick"
[09:12:13] <jaubourg> np rick
[09:12:16] <jaubourg> :P
[09:12:18] <rwaldron> which doesn't light me up
[09:12:47] <rwaldron> anyway, re: event timestamp, that should be reported to webkit
[09:12:56] <rwaldron> before we bother messing with it
[09:13:02] <rwaldron> if they say "piss off"
[09:13:08] <rwaldron> then we can do something
[09:13:13] <rwaldron> otherwise, it's their fault
[09:13:24] <rwaldron> I'm going to post this to the ticket
[09:13:36] <timmywil> I just stuck a link to open tickets in there so the bugs team can stay aware of open tickets while trac emails are on the fritz http://goo.gl/fbZD3
[09:14:11] <timmywil> there are only 16 right now
[09:15:46] <rwaldron> I just triaged a few
[09:15:55] <timmywil> as far as the deprecation list, I think we need a way for the core team to vote on deprecation/removal for each item in 1.8
[09:16:06] <rwaldron> agreed
[09:16:14] <rwaldron> i say defer to dev days
[09:16:37] <timmywil> that sounds good to me
[09:16:50] <timmywil> will promote some discussion too
[09:16:57] <rwaldron> agreed
[09:17:20] <rwaldron> anyone not present can be skyped in
[09:17:45] <timmywil> And 1.8
[09:17:45] <mikesherov> we should fix this ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11443
[09:18:00] <mikesherov> and this one: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11441
[09:18:28] <rwaldron> Safari 5.0.5?
[09:18:34] <rwaldron> Safari Current - 1
[09:18:36] <timmywil> yea i noticed those, has anyone reproduced?
[09:18:38] <mikesherov> so, both of those tickets are support unit tests failing because we fixed a support  test and now the expected results are wrong
[09:18:42] <rwaldron> I'm not hearing any noise from Mobile
[09:19:02] <rwaldron> the last time i ran the tests in the supported browsers, i saw no such failures
[09:19:26] <mikesherov> basically, we fixed those support tests, but not the expected result when we compare actual support test values against specific browsers
[09:19:32] <rwaldron> ok
[09:19:38] <mikesherov> In Chrome 16
[09:19:39] <rwaldron> if someone can confirm that and fix it
[09:19:42] <rwaldron> then, awesome
[09:19:49] <mikesherov> OK, I'll PR them
[09:19:53] <rwaldron> thanks mikesherov
[09:19:56] <mikesherov> NP
[09:20:22] <timmywil> Yea, I only have 17 and canary now
[09:20:27] <mikesherov> right
[09:20:44] <mikesherov> rwaldron and I discussed this over a PR. We technically still support Chrome 16
[09:20:52] <rwaldron> timmywil browserstack covers 16
[09:20:52] <timmywil> true nuff
[09:21:01] <timmywil> rwaldron: ah, good point
[09:21:02] <rwaldron> mikesherov: +1
[09:21:05] <rwaldron> current -1
[09:21:09] <mikesherov> right
[09:21:12] <rwaldron> is 16 & 17
[09:21:37] <rwaldron> Anything else?
[09:21:39] <timmywil> April 9 is the tentative date for a beta for 1.8 that Dave set last week.
[09:21:48] <timmywil> I see someone added "wat"
[09:21:52] <rwaldron> I did
[09:21:53] <mikesherov> and as far as safari goes, we'll just remove the expected results support test
[09:22:02] <rwaldron> I've been urging to slow down with 1.8
[09:22:04] <rwaldron> why rush
[09:22:05] <timmywil> rwaldron: too early?
[09:22:13] <rwaldron> people dont like the rush we did in 2011
[09:22:53] <rwaldron> maybe a "dev channel" thing...
[09:22:59] <rwaldron> call it "1.next"
[09:23:12] <timmywil> I'm not sure Dave's reasoning for scheduling it then. Perhaps April seemed much farther off last week.
[09:23:12] <mikesherov> Only argument for a rush would be border-box and vendor prefixing
[09:23:21] <mikesherov> My "pets"
[09:23:23] <rwaldron> to put a fully qualified 1.8 is going to be met with "we just got 1.7"
[09:23:38] <rwaldron> mikesherov 1.7.3?
[09:23:41] <mikesherov> Sure
[09:23:51] <rwaldron> make that argument instead
[09:24:00] <timmywil> right, well perhaps April 9 isn't a bad date to create 1.8 branches
[09:24:03] <mikesherov> but vendor prefixing and border-box might be too large for a point point release
[09:24:06] <rwaldron> timmywil fair enough
[09:24:16] <rwaldron> mikesherov that too
[09:24:51] <mikesherov> so, while we're talking about triage
[09:25:01] <mikesherov> I think we should discuss needsreview
[09:25:07] <mikesherov> anyone up to discuss those?
[09:25:25] <timmywil> mikesherov: we can probably save those for a triage day
[09:25:40] <mikesherov> triage day? What's that?
[09:26:01] <timmywil> every so often we get together on skype and triage as a group
[09:26:16] <mikesherov> OH
[09:26:22] <mikesherov> or review the PR queue
[09:26:26] <timmywil> I'll put a note to ask dave about scheduling one next week
[09:26:29] <timmywil> mikesherov: exactly
[09:26:31] <rwaldron> ugh
[09:26:39] <mikesherov> OK, I'd like not to be a typing cyborg this time
[09:26:41] <timmywil> and by next week, I mean scheduling one, not doing it next week
[09:26:44] <rwaldron> i want to blow up the PR queue
[09:26:58] <rwaldron> did anyone read the post about Guava?
[09:27:05] <mikesherov> LOL
[09:27:08] <mikesherov> Yes!
[09:27:16] <mikesherov> But they NEVER even comment
[09:27:49] <timmywil> anything else for the meeting?
[09:28:21] <timmywil> cool, back to -dev!
[09:28:29] <timmywil> thanks 'erbody
[09:28:37] <timmywil> <3
[09:28:39] <rwaldron> bye!
