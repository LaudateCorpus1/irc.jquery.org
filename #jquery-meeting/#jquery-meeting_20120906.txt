[11:02:02] <todd_> Hi all
[11:02:09] <MauriceG> Hi
[11:02:13] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:02:17] <todd_> The jQuery Mobile team meeting starting up
[11:02:18] <uGoMobi> hello
[11:02:22] <todd_> chime in if you're here
[11:02:32] <todd_> hey _|Nix|_ MauriceG and uGoMobi
[11:02:47] <todd_> is gseguin agcolom or johnbender here
[11:02:59] <gseguin> sir yes sir
[11:03:00] <todd_> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MJ5-RXgR4bfFLzb49mNvUi85LKphJgVeGhCvLJnXqO4/edit#
[11:03:04] <todd_> hey gseguin
[11:03:10] <johnbender> here
[11:03:26] <todd_> gang's all here (mostly)
[11:03:36] <todd_> let's try to do this fast
[11:03:43] <todd_> i'll start off
[11:03:46] <todd_> first...
[11:03:49] <todd_> 1.2 Beta - released on Wednesday - 60+ fixes, support for jQuery core 1.8.1, new history tracking option for popups. Blog post:  http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/09/05/jquery-mobile-1-2-beta-released/
[11:04:12] <todd_> woo hoo. great work everyone. thanks for getting those issues solved. it wasn't pretty.
[11:04:26] <todd_> a few bugs that cropped up
[11:04:35] <todd_> Popups/custom selects shift position on first open on iPad - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4949
[11:04:49] <todd_> this one is super specific to reproduce but it's there.
[11:05:06] <todd_> sort of wondering if the fixed toolbars ar einvolved
[11:05:31] <todd_> anyone want to take point on that? I think _|Nix|_ is listed
[11:05:34] <_|Nix|_> todd_: I've reproduced the custom select issue.
[11:05:36] <todd_> _|Nix|_: do you have an iPad?
[11:06:00] <_|Nix|_> todd_: The custom select issue is happening on my iPod Touch with scrolling and everything ... so far.
[11:06:01] <todd_> yeah, same as the popup issue we were looking at yesterday that MauriceG found
[11:06:11] <todd_> oh, so it's worse
[11:06:13] <todd_> ok
[11:06:27] <todd_> if you have time to give that a diagnosis
[11:06:29] <_|Nix|_> todd_: It may be worse, but it's great, because I now have something to work with.
[11:06:33] <todd_> yeah
[11:06:55] <todd_> uGoMobi Wilto or MauriceG may be able to help out of CSS witchcraft
[11:07:02] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:07:07] <todd_> next one Dialog not showing in PhoneGap - need info https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[11:07:19] <todd_> thinking johnbender might want to give this a look
[11:07:20] <_|Nix|_> I still suspect it has to do with resizings ...
[11:07:46] <johnbender> todd_: I can take a look though I don't have that device
[11:07:55] <uGoMobi> there is another issue with PG and resizing on Android ICS (Nexus)
[11:07:56] <johnbender> reproducible on any others?
[11:08:03] <agcolom> sorry for the delay I'm here now...
[11:08:07] <uGoMobi> I can take that one
[11:08:13] <uGoMobi> welcome back Anne!
[11:08:20] <johnbender> ah nevermind
[11:08:22] <johnbender> just read the issue
[11:08:23] <MauriceG> Welcome Anne :-)
[11:08:37] <todd_> johnbender: that issue doesn't mention a device/os
[11:08:49] <johnbender> ah
[11:08:51] <johnbender> sorry let me check
[11:08:52] <todd_> PhoneGap
[11:08:57] <todd_> I asked for more info.
[11:09:02] <johnbender> todd_: thought we were talking about the popup
[11:09:04] * johnbender is slow
[11:09:32] <todd_> ah, no - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[11:09:35] <johnbender> yah
[11:10:09] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Wait ... confused ... 4946 is the popup jump issue ...
[11:10:09] <todd_> last one I flagged so far
[11:10:11] <todd_> Slider button is displayed too much to the right
[11:10:11] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4944
[11:10:18] <johnbender> todd_: our handling of dialogs as the default in the page is broken I think
[11:10:19] <todd_> uGoMobi is looking into this one
[11:10:22] <johnbender> that might be related
[11:10:29] <todd_> johnbender: interesting
[11:10:49] <uGoMobi> I am looking for that other issue with PG ... think it was assigned to johnbender
[11:11:02] <todd_> uGoMobi: feel free to re-assign
[11:11:10] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3795
[11:11:15] <uGoMobi> here it is
[11:11:28] <uGoMobi> have to see if it can be related
[11:12:08] <uGoMobi> but I can look into that one
[11:12:25] <johnbender> todd_: that's the issue actually "externally linked dialogues"
[11:12:28] <johnbender> giveaway
[11:12:33] <todd_> ok. that issue has a long history
[11:12:39] <johnbender> todd_: it does
[11:12:45] <johnbender> but recall we added support for converting it to a page
[11:12:50] <johnbender> that's broken
[11:12:50] <todd_> seems like mixed results
[11:12:59] <johnbender> that was our stopgap
[11:13:03] <todd_> johnbender: ah, that was a fairly recent addition
[11:13:17] <johnbender> the test for it wasn't named properly so the testing glob didn't catch it and it wasn't getting run
[11:13:27] <todd_> i see :/
[11:13:28] <johnbender> I'll take a look
[11:13:34] <todd_> so you're on the case?
[11:13:36] <johnbender> yessir
[11:13:36] <todd_> nice
[11:13:48] <todd_> we'll monitor to see if other issues come in over the next few days
[11:14:01] <todd_> johnbender: what is that issue #
[11:14:12] <johnbender> 4946?
[11:14:29] <_|Nix|_>  johnbender: That's a popup issue.
[11:14:32] <todd_> gotcha
[11:14:41] <johnbender> ?
[11:14:43] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[11:14:46] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[11:15:04] <_|Nix|_> Oh, NM ... 4949 is the popup issue ...
[11:15:12] <johnbender> yah I made the same mistake earlier
[11:15:19] <johnbender> so hard to follow numbers over 3 digits :(
[11:15:24] * johnbender cursese his small simian brain
[11:15:29] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:15:46] <_|Nix|_> one, two, three ... many
[11:15:46] <uGoMobi> haha
[11:16:00] <todd_> I was doing more roadmap re-org, if we have time after this maybe we can review
[11:16:06] <todd_> that's it for me
[11:16:12] <todd_> who wants to go next?
[11:16:18] <agcolom> can I?
[11:16:21] <todd_> sure!
[11:16:37] <agcolom> ok, just back from holiday... so not much to report
[11:17:00] <agcolom> I am now up to date with the api docs changes made by the ui and core guys
[11:17:18] <agcolom> so I'm ready to do more widgets
[11:17:44] <agcolom> I want to also have a go at changing the color code higlighting
[11:17:54] <agcolom> (in hte api docs)
[11:18:29] <agcolom> and the sad news is that I will be missing next week because my father in law died yesterday and the funerals are next thursday
[11:18:35] <todd_> agcolom: i'd imagine the color code will be global across all the project APIs
[11:18:44] <todd_> So sorry to hear that
[11:18:53] <agcolom> so I'll be away again from wednesday to sunday...
[11:18:56] <agcolom> thx :-)
[11:19:09] <todd_> good to know.
[11:19:10] <MauriceG> agcolom: :-(
[11:19:18] <gseguin> Sorry to hear :(
[11:19:27] <agcolom> thx
[11:19:36] <uGoMobi> sorry to hear too :(
[11:19:37] <agcolom> yes I had a chat about the colors
[11:19:48] <_|Nix|_> My condolences.
[11:19:50] <todd_> so i'm thinking that the API docs will be a big activity for the hackfest
[11:19:51] <agcolom> with schott G
[11:20:07] <todd_> so we can get you some help
[11:20:14] <agcolom> yes, that's my understanding as well
[11:20:23] <todd_> once the widgets are done, we need to document all the other scripts
[11:20:26] <agcolom> scott G^
[11:20:56] <agcolom> just to check, are text inputs and textarea 1 widget?
[11:21:19] <todd_> agcolom: start thinking about collecting a checklist/tips so we can have  others write these the right way from the get go
[11:21:25] <todd_> agcolom: yes
[11:21:46] <todd_> dialog isn't documented in the API style now in the docs
[11:22:03] <todd_> that will be good to fix up
[11:22:27] <agcolom> yes, I had to do that one for the api, so I can do the docs style for that one as well.
[11:22:43] <agcolom> I can do that this weekend I think...
[11:22:51] <todd_> nice
[11:22:58] <todd_> ok, anything else?
[11:23:05] <agcolom> nope, that's it :-)
[11:23:11] <MauriceG> one shorty ?
[11:23:20] <todd_> sure
[11:23:22] <agcolom> and I did miss you all a lot ;-)
[11:23:31] <todd_> we missed you too!
[11:23:35] <uGoMobi> missed you too Anne :)
[11:23:42] <gseguin> heh, same here
[11:23:43] <MauriceG> I know it looks weird, but the user put a slider into a collapsible.
[11:23:43] <Wilto> who said shorty don’t call me that
[11:23:56] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:24:10] <MauriceG> Clicking the slider bubbles to the collapsible and make it "work" too
[11:24:28] <Wilto> MauriceG: Ahh, yeah.
[11:24:30] <MauriceG> uhps ...  Sorry ...
[11:24:36] <todd_> MauriceG: yeah, that is an odd one
[11:24:48] <MauriceG> http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/mf7gx/
[11:25:19] <uGoMobi> I am on the issue with the 5px left/right margin
[11:25:21] <todd_> guess I can see the use case
[11:25:36] <todd_> turn on wifi, see a list of options in the collapsible
[11:25:42] <todd_> thanks uGoMobi
[11:26:02] <todd_> those slider do look broken for sure
[11:26:23] <Wilto> They aren’t not broken.
[11:26:30] <MauriceG> yeah, but thats the styling issue
[11:26:39] <todd_> yep, understood
[11:26:41] <todd_> ok, let's keep going on therundown
[11:26:59] <todd_> what else are you up to MauriceG
[11:27:18] <MauriceG> Working on a CSS solution for an issue with header/content/footer corners in popups having data-corners active. Now testing some kinds of edge cases. I'll ask Jasper to look into until/at next weekend.
[11:27:24] <todd_> uGoMobi: you're looking at all the slider issues on that test page, right?
[11:27:38] <todd_> MauriceG: thanks, test page looks good
[11:27:39] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:27:43] <todd_> k
[11:27:51] <uGoMobi> I already know what causes it
[11:28:01] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: cool !
[11:28:10] <uGoMobi> although i see something weird with the flip toggle too
[11:28:23] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: seems not too easy
[11:28:37] <todd_> uGoMobi: wanna go next?
[11:28:42] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:28:52] <uGoMobi> done some triage
[11:28:57] <uGoMobi> now working on....
[11:29:05] <uGoMobi> 2 issue with grid CSS
[11:29:05] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4945
[11:29:05] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4944
[11:29:24] <uGoMobi> so thats is the 5px margin left/right issue
[11:29:29] <uGoMobi> that*
[11:29:52] <uGoMobi> its regression from fixing another issue
[11:30:04] <todd_> right
[11:30:08] <uGoMobi> 1px jitter fixed toolbars
[11:30:08] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4895
[11:30:12] <todd_> everything is interconnected
[11:30:32] <uGoMobi> I thought we could land it in beta but saw problem during testing
[11:30:33] <johnbender> todd_: welcome to software :) <3
[11:30:39] <uGoMobi> :D
[11:30:39] <todd_> yep
[11:30:51] <uGoMobi> click events passing true fixed toolbars on Android (setting up good test page first)
[11:30:51] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912
[11:30:54] <todd_> luckily we have tests
[11:31:04] <todd_> that will be an interesting one uGoMobi
[11:31:10] <todd_> android is so buggy
[11:31:18] <todd_> but a good test page is the way to go
[11:31:34] <uGoMobi> and I will test that fixed toolbars + PG on Galaxy Nexus as discussed earlier
[11:31:57] <uGoMobi> actually it has been reported for iOS too
[11:32:08] <uGoMobi> mostly Android though
[11:32:20] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[11:32:30] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Can I call dibs on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912 ?
[11:32:44] <Wilto> ( He said with tremendous resignation. )
[11:32:46] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:32:53] <Wilto> Cool; I have a couple ideas there.
[11:33:03] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:33:53] <todd_> uGoMobi: did you already build the test page?
[11:33:59] <uGoMobi> want me to create test page on my repo (rule out possible JSBin interference)?
[11:34:08] <todd_> yes please
[11:34:09] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... naïve question: Shouldn't we be concentrating on issues milestoned 1.2? Or, are some of the issues severe enough that they ought to be milestoned but aren't?
[11:34:09] <uGoMobi> was working on it
[11:34:14] <todd_> you tests are super thorough
[11:35:01] <todd_> _|Nix|_: yes, thinking this would most likely be for after 1.2
[11:35:24] <todd_> My preference is to focus on those 3-4 issues we started with
[11:35:27] <todd_> and ship 1.2
[11:35:46] <todd_> just to keep everyone on the prize
[11:35:47] <_|Nix|_> todd_: OK ... we have, like, 40 issues milestoned 1.2 IIRC ...
[11:35:55] <todd_> we can always fix these others in 1.2.1
[11:36:01] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:36:11] <todd_> i'll go thru and move some to a new 1.2.1 milestone
[11:36:16] <uGoMobi> maybe we have to give the milestones a  good look
[11:36:29] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Awesome!
[11:36:31] <MauriceG> will there be a 1.1.2 ?
[11:36:38] <uGoMobi> are we still planning on doing a 1.1.2
[11:37:10] <_|Nix|_> I can think of a fix that could go there ...
[11:37:13] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  we say: Zwei Doofe, ein Gedanke ...
[11:37:23] <todd_> working on that now...
[11:37:36] * uGoMobi opens translate.google.com
[11:37:44] <todd_> yes, we can work on that one 1.2.0 goes out
[11:37:46] <MauriceG> stop ...
[11:37:55] <todd_> all: keep picking fixes into 1.1-stable
[11:38:18] <agcolom> todd_: will you update the gbs page?
[11:38:55] <MauriceG> todd_:  I think I'll never find out key changes for 1.1.2
[11:38:56] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[11:39:02] <uGoMobi> I added that to the release checklist on the wiki BTW
[11:39:31] <agcolom> uGoMobi: to update the gbs page?
[11:39:43] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: we can see what have been picked in 1.1 branch after 1.1.1 release right?
[11:39:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[11:39:52] <agcolom> perfect!!!!
[11:39:55] <agcolom> thx!
[11:40:16] <todd_> MauriceG: that will be font o figure out
[11:40:37] <todd_> that list was helpful agcolom
[11:40:40] <_|Nix|_> Can I go next?
[11:40:44] <todd_> sure
[11:40:47] <_|Nix|_> OK, so ...
[11:40:52] <_|Nix|_> Vacation ...
[11:40:59] <_|Nix|_> Popup screen size fix.
[11:41:05] <_|Nix|_> 404 issue fix.
[11:41:19] <_|Nix|_> Need to cherry pick the 404 issue fix to 1.1-stable
[11:41:28] <johnbender> yar
[11:41:39] <_|Nix|_> Need to look at the popup-jump fix now that I have a solid repro case.
[11:41:51] <_|Nix|_> #3635 can be milestoned 1.2.1
[11:42:15] <_|Nix|_> That's the make-buttonMarkup-data-corners-into-a-string issue.
[11:42:29] <_|Nix|_> So, like, data-corners="top-left"
[11:42:32] <_|Nix|_> For example.
[11:42:39] <_|Nix|_> I had that on the back burner for a while.
[11:42:57] <todd_> looks like you already moved that milestone
[11:43:18] <_|Nix|_> I did? Wow!
[11:43:22] <_|Nix|_> Not I ...
[11:43:27] <Wilto> ?cc
[11:43:27] <_|Nix|_> But great!
[11:43:27] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[11:43:52] <todd_> maybe i did
[11:43:55] <todd_> bulk re-assign mode
[11:44:03] <_|Nix|_> I guess that's about it for me ...
[11:44:53] <gseguin> me! me! me! pick me!
[11:45:11] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:45:34] <gseguin> Week off
[11:45:48] <todd_> that was easy :)
[11:45:51] <uGoMobi> thanks for the update gseguin  ... next
[11:45:53] <gseguin> Builder backend stuff
[11:45:56] <_|Nix|_> LOL :)
[11:45:58] <_|Nix|_> Good one :)
[11:46:23] <gseguin> Moved server from Joyent's no.de to jQuery's server
[11:46:34] <todd_> that
[11:46:35] <todd_> is
[11:46:37] <todd_> super
[11:46:46] <Wilto> +
[11:46:47] <Wilto> 1
[11:47:06] <gseguin> still working on an improvement to remove a manual step
[11:47:14] <johnbender> it's still written in node aparently
[11:47:17] * johnbender shrugs
[11:47:17] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:47:19] <johnbender> :)
[11:47:26] <johnbender> <3 <3
[11:47:30] * gseguin throws something at johnbender
[11:47:48] <Wilto> i heard node was good tho
[11:47:59] <gseguin> spent some time trying to reproduce a popup issue we were having at Jive without much success
[11:48:06] <gseguin> that's it
[11:48:07] * johnbender has no comment
[11:48:21] <gnarf> It's all 🍔's and 🍕 johnbender
[11:48:41] <Wilto> Can I ask the nature of the mystery issue, gseguin? We can catch up post-meeting on it.
[11:49:04] <gseguin> let's take that to -dev Wilto
[11:49:19] <johnbender> I can go next
[11:49:35] <johnbender> popup stuff on Tuesday and TestSwarm bugs yesterday
[11:49:41] <johnbender> that's going to be a long hard slog
[11:50:47] <todd_> johnbender: where are we at with this base tag issue - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3978
[11:51:08] <todd_> do you want to update that branch and have us do testing?
[11:51:18] <todd_> already moved to 1.2.1
[11:52:51] <johnbender> todd_: I was waiting to hear back on one of the child issues
[11:53:07] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4456
[11:53:10] <johnbender> looks like they got back to me
[11:53:14] <johnbender> that doesn't solve the isseu
[11:53:30] <johnbender> but it lets people disable the base tag changes
[11:53:52] <todd_> i see
[11:53:53] <johnbender> which is a first step
[11:54:07] <johnbender> then next step is to grab the base tag value from the document being loaded
[11:54:11] <johnbender> that's a lot of work :/
[11:54:22] <Wilto> Hm.
[11:55:32] <todd_> so should i move out to 1.3? seems like a bigger change
[11:55:48] <johnbender> todd_: yah I would move that parent ticket to 1.3
[11:55:50] <johnbender> :(
[11:56:08] <Wilto> I blame you personally, johnbender.
[11:56:32] <todd_> moved both
[11:56:34] <johnbender> o.o
[11:56:36] <johnbender> :)
[11:57:06] <todd_> Wilto: I'd like you to test JasonDScott's PR for this - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4828
[11:57:11] <todd_> nasty issue
[11:57:28] <todd_> JasonDScott: you tested this and it seems to check out on all your BB devices?
[11:57:39] <Wilto> Ooh, gross.
[11:57:42] <Wilto> On it.
[11:57:52] <todd_> great
[11:58:04] <todd_> our 1.2.0 issue list
[11:58:04] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=13&page=1&state=open
