[09:00:20] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol, arthurvr meeting time!
[09:00:25] <arthurvr> hey!
[09:00:28] <DaveMethvin> present
[09:00:33] <arthurvr> I’m here but probably not for the whole meeting :/
[09:01:25] <timmywil> No problem. I expect this will be short meeting unless more gets added to the agenda.
[09:01:57] <timmywil> I'll go ahead and get started. Patch release is coming up. I've got a PR in. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2185
[09:02:18] <timmywil> If I haven't missed anything, I think we can schedule the release for this week
[09:02:32] <gibson042> Sizzle release will happen within the next 24 hours for realz
[09:02:39] <arthurvr> Awesome!
[09:02:42] <DaveMethvin> haha i know that feeling
[09:03:03] <timmywil> hooray!
[09:03:27] <timmywil> that takes care of the next item
[09:03:42] <timmywil> but please review my PR because I'd hate to have to do another patch release :P
[09:04:14] <timmywil> also, unless you'd like to do it DaveMethvin, I figured I would take this opportunity to write my first release blog post?
[09:04:30] <DaveMethvin> go for it!
[09:04:33] <timmywil> nice and short
[09:05:01] <DaveMethvin> second consecutive Safari-caused patch release, they're on a roll
[09:05:42] <timmywil> I'll try not to let my misanthropy show
[09:05:50] <timmywil> is that a word?
[09:05:56] <timmywil> anyway
[09:05:57] <gibson042> it is indeed
[09:06:02] <arthurvr> yes it is!
[09:06:44] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: what is the state of the 3.0 blog post? There's more to add, right? But I'm not sure how much more.
[09:07:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm not sure either
[09:07:12] <DaveMethvin> it may depend on what lands before then
[09:07:25] <DaveMethvin> i need to review the list again
[09:07:39] <timmywil> gotcha, ok
[09:07:59] <timmywil> We have several PRs that I think could land
[09:08:12] <timmywil> First, in Sizzle https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/328
[09:08:25] <timmywil> I like this better than exposing expando
[09:08:41] <gibson042> yep, that'll be in
[09:08:50] <timmywil> cool
[09:09:13] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2182 jQuery.swap
[09:09:26] <DaveMethvin> i think we should do that one
[09:09:39] <markelog> do we need to rush it?
[09:09:40] <timmywil> agreed
[09:09:40] <DaveMethvin> i can put it into Migrate if needed
[09:09:50] <timmywil> markelog: yes and no, I think it should go into beta
[09:10:04] <markelog> we can't wait until 4.0?
[09:10:16] <markelog> it might be better to put in the migrate first
[09:10:17] <DaveMethvin> markelog do you know of other stuff that will break?
[09:10:31] <DaveMethvin> it's such a bad perf practice
[09:10:35] <timmywil> I'm not sure it's used enough to be overly cautious, and the beta will give us some feedback
[09:10:41] <DaveMethvin> for now we're just hiding it so that nobody else uses it
[09:10:53] <timmywil> oh, something to mention in blog post DaveMethvin
[09:10:57] <markelog> DaveMethvin: sure, but we can't remove it
[09:10:59] <timmywil> I'll add a note in there
[09:11:02] <markelog> only stop exposing it
[09:11:03] <DaveMethvin> ok good
[09:11:27] <DaveMethvin> we could remove it if we changed the rules on trying to get the dimensions of hidden elements tho, right?
[09:11:34] <DaveMethvin> thats not a 3.0 thing, i agree
[09:11:35] <markelog> i don't why we want to do it know and not be cautious
[09:11:45] <markelog> it doesn't save bytes nor improve perf
[09:11:58] <DaveMethvin> it lets us know if anyone else is depending on it
[09:12:09] <markelog> migrate will do that, no?
[09:12:16] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:12:20] <timmywil> but we know we want it private – or removed – eventually
[09:12:21] <markelog> we would do the 4.0 beta too?
[09:12:42] <markelog> timmywil: yeah
[09:12:43] <timmywil> so it's a step in the right direction even if not removed right now
[09:12:46] <DaveMethvin> we are not removing the functionality of jQuery.swap, just not exposing it so nobody else can use the undocumnted method
[09:12:52] <markelog> but that way we can communicate this to the user
[09:12:57] <DaveMethvin> which nobody is supposed to be doing anyway
[09:13:33] <markelog> well, drupal start using it without any docs
[09:13:34] <timmywil> markelog: I agree with the concern, but this is where it's nice to have the migrate plugin, which can re-expose it and add a warning.
[09:14:07] <markelog> exactly, i only propose to be a bit more careful
[09:14:21] <markelog> if user would use a migrate he will notice the warninng
[09:14:26] <markelog> and will spread the info
[09:14:36] <DaveMethvin> yep, i already have a ticket for it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/100
[09:14:49] <DaveMethvin> i'll get that done this week
[09:15:04] <markelog> we probably will get a lot of heat about 3.0
[09:15:36] <markelog> i'm suggesting not add more, without explicit need
[09:15:55] <timmywil> I suspect the heat will be in regards to other issues
[09:16:21] <markelog> timmywil: DaveMethvin: if you guys sure, then it's okay with me
[09:16:39] <timmywil> gibson042: which way are you leaning?
[09:17:13] <gibson042> I see no reason not to do something in 3.0
[09:17:32] <timmywil> ok, we'll land for beta then
[09:17:36] <gibson042> document or remove, though, I don't really care
[09:17:40] <gibson042> ;)
[09:17:53] <DaveMethvin> it's a perf killer so i'd be against documenting it
[09:18:09] <timmywil> yea, I'd rather not promote usage
[09:18:36] <markelog> btw, just curious, is there a perf link?
[09:19:57] <DaveMethvin> i don't have one but it forces layout
[09:20:00] <timmywil> well, it's not always a perf issue, but it can be really bad when changing display forces layouts or paints
[09:20:46] <markelog> well, if you use swap you use it for a reason, if next step would be to change layout, i douth there would be a lot of perf problems
[09:20:55] <markelog> since browsers now optimize these things
[09:21:18] <DaveMethvin> we use it to get the dimensions of a hidden element which is a bad thing to do in general
[09:21:27] <timmywil> the problem is it requires a static layout before values are retrieved
[09:21:33] <timmywil> the browser can't optimize that
[09:21:37] <DaveMethvin> since you have to show, make the browser reflow, hide, make the browser reflow again
[09:22:09] <gibson042> it's that second reflow that would get combined
[09:22:16] <markelog> exactly!
[09:22:31] <markelog> so if next step is another reflow, after the swap, what is the harm?
[09:22:52] <DaveMethvin> only the second one is combined
[09:23:00] <DaveMethvin> the first is sync and forced
[09:23:21] <markelog> right, but user use swap for something right?
[09:23:28] <markelog> It might be a third reflow
[09:23:34] <markelog> then it would be only one too
[09:23:39] <gibson042> the biggest argument against exposing jQuery.swap is that we might not need such a method in the future but would still have to support it
[09:23:41] <DaveMethvin> no user shoudl be using swap, we never documented it
[09:23:57] <markelog> right
[09:24:08] <markelog> but they do use it :)
[09:24:13] <DaveMethvin> i can put it into Migrate
[09:24:16] <gibson042> but it seems to be the right way to perform such an operation, and there's little need to force wheel reinvention upon users
[09:24:41] <markelog> depends on the use-case i suppose
[09:24:44] <DaveMethvin> the problem is that people don't realize the burden it puts on perf
[09:24:50] <timmywil> I still think the operation should be avoided if possible
[09:25:03] <DaveMethvin> there are usually better ways to do it but the "lazy" way is to ask the browser, not realizing the amount of work it has to do
[09:25:08] <gibson042> sure
[09:25:12] <markelog> yep
[09:25:13] <timmywil> If not possible, it's not hard for the user to do themselves
[09:25:29] <gibson042> so let's move it to Migrate and see what happens
[09:25:37] <DaveMethvin> i'm good with that
[09:25:37] <timmywil> yes
[09:25:43] <markelog> sure
[09:25:57] <arthurvr> :+1:
[09:25:57] <timmywil> ok, I was going to discuss 2183, but I see mgol is working on getting a test for that one
[09:26:04] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2179
[09:26:17] <timmywil> minor amd change
[09:26:33] <timmywil> I'm fine with this
[09:27:05] <timmywil> but if we want to adhere to this everywhere, I'll need to make some changes in the build
[09:27:15] <timmywil> wait, no I won't
[09:27:32] <timmywil> the build requires r.js, so that's fine
[09:27:51] <timmywil> so yea, I'll double check but I think this is it
[09:28:03] <DaveMethvin> sounds easy enough
[09:28:38] <DaveMethvin> i have to run, if you need anything just ping me ... i'll be working on migrate and the blog post draft
[09:28:49] <timmywil> ok, and lastly, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2125 markelog's PR on simplifying some usage of native APIs
[09:29:40] <timmywil> it looks like it's possible we don't have a proper test for FF on one change
[09:29:52] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2125#discussion_r26093516
[09:30:07] <markelog> Oli responded
[09:30:15] <markelog> sorry
[09:30:15] <markelog> Olli
[09:30:41] <timmywil> oh cool, so are is there anything else pending on that one?
[09:30:43] <markelog> it seems we might need to have this workaround in the near future
[09:30:49] <timmywil> ah
[09:31:09] <markelog> *no need )
[09:32:23] <timmywil> ok, sounds like we wait on this one for now tho
[09:32:50] <markelog> timmywil: why?
[09:32:57] <markelog> you mean pull?
[09:33:23] <timmywil> maybe I misunderstood. I took what you said as we still need the workaround for now, but soon we won't.
[09:34:03] <markelog> right, when new FF will come along
[09:34:42] <markelog> depends on the discussion though
[09:35:05] <timmywil> oh, I was reading the wrong lines. You left in that workaround.
[09:35:40] <timmywil> ok, so, if you think it's ready, land it :)
[09:36:40] <markelog> cool
[09:36:57] <timmywil> ok, that's all this week. Thanks everybody!
[09:36:59] <arthurvr> I had a quick thingy. We’ve got a few minutes?
[09:37:04] <timmywil> sure
[09:37:04] <arthurvr> couldn’t add it to the agenda, I don’t have access
[09:37:09] <arthurvr> this thing: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/600
[09:37:12] <arthurvr> do we have a consensus in there yet?
[09:37:27] <markelog> just about to post that link )
[09:38:26] <markelog> i have that we can "animate" object properties or "removeListener" from them
[09:38:29] <markelog> looks weird
[09:39:19] <markelog> for example - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2125/files#diff-031bb62d959e7e4949d1847c82507f33R635
[09:39:46] <timmywil> I think I agree with markelog. We're really inconsistent. Either we should support it everywhere, or drop it.
[09:40:56] <markelog> timmywil: if we would agree on this, we could put it in the migrate
[09:41:22] <timmywil> I mean, is anyone against that?
[09:41:22] <markelog> it would also help us identify places where we need such checks
[09:41:23] <gibson042> this should be tabled to next week because it relates to the effects documentation conversation
[09:41:34] <timmywil> good point
[09:41:44] <arthurvr> yeah totally right
[09:41:53] <timmywil> would be nice to have gnarf and Dave's input too
[09:42:10] <arthurvr> sure. Let’s punt it till next week
[09:42:26] <timmywil> ok, added for next week
[09:42:30] <markelog> who do they correleate?
[09:42:46] <markelog> just insteresting
[09:42:46] <markelog> )
[09:42:57] <timmywil> hmm?
[09:43:32] <gibson042> because 1.8 effects explicitly support objects
[09:43:38] <markelog> what is the connection between documenting Tween and plain objects?
[09:44:37] <timmywil> also, given gnarf's close relationship with the animate code and Dave's connection to events, they might argue for legitimate use cases for plain objects
[09:44:56] <gibson042> mmm, right
[09:45:02] <markelog> yeah, would be very insteresting to get their input
[09:45:05] <gibson042> I think I can come up with some as well
[09:45:35] <timmywil> ok, thanks everyone!
[09:45:39] <timmywil> peace
[09:45:41] <arthurvr> Bye!
