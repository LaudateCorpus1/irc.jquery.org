[10:06:47] <arthurvr> hey
[10:06:51] <slayslot> Hello
[10:06:53] <kristyjy> hiya
[10:06:55] <sfrisk> slayslot!
[10:06:59] <sfrisk> forgot slayslot
[10:07:11] <slayslot> it's alright :P
[10:07:12] <sfrisk> it's been a crazy day, sorry for the late start
[10:07:55] <arschmitz> hi
[10:08:02] <sfrisk> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:10:30] <sfrisk> so last week was a bit of a bust because of the holiday and work meetings and stuff
[10:10:46] <sfrisk> first off to discuss, is that work on Chassis Themeroller has started
[10:10:58] <sfrisk> you may have noticed some of our mini meetings in css-chassis 2x a week
[10:11:20] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit is our gsoc student who will be working on the themeroller over the course of the summer
[10:14:51] <sfrisk> so next up on the agenda is our style guides
[10:14:57] <sfrisk> how goes the progress on those?
[10:15:07] <sfrisk> slayslot, kristyjy?
[10:16:05] <slayslot> I submitted another PR and even fixed the CLA:Error. I don't know if anyone has reviewed it yet.
[10:16:21] <sfrisk> link?
[10:16:34] <sfrisk> I don't think I got the email regarding a PR for that
[10:16:44] <slayslot> https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/117
[10:16:51] <arthurvr> Iâ€™ll be happy to go over it again.
[10:17:13] <kristyjy> I have made pretty good progress this weekend on it. I outlined the sections I plan to cover and started writing in a few sections. I have plans to work on it after work a few days this week to hopefully get a PR ready for next week
[10:17:59] <sfrisk> okay, everyone, when you have some spare time this week, please review slayslot's PR
[10:18:13] <sfrisk> Sounds good, kristyjy
[10:18:39] <sfrisk> so I think I meant to discuss https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/84 two weeks ago
[10:18:44] <sfrisk> but then we discussed some other things instead
[10:19:12] <sfrisk> I think we should create an issue to prevent the overwriting of the default <a> underline
[10:19:37] <sfrisk> since JimBobSquarePants made a good point about how that kinda went against what we're trying to do for Chassis
[10:21:03] <sfrisk> hey michaelarestad
[10:21:09] <arthurvr> hey hey
[10:24:01] <sfrisk> I'm open to agreements/disagreements
[10:24:13] <sfrisk> if we all agree, I can create an issue for someone to fix that
[10:24:24] <arschmitz> i agree
[10:24:52] <kristyjy> I agree
[10:25:36] <slayslot> Agreed
[10:25:54] <sfrisk> okay, I'll create the issue after this meeting
[10:26:41] <kristyjy> You mentioned the style guide in that issue as well. Is a section about not overriding default browser functionality in that way still something we want?
[10:26:56] <sfrisk> this might make https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/81 obsolete, if we remove slim-underline()
[10:27:39] <sfrisk> there are cases where we don't want to override default browser functionality, specifically around accessibility, right arschmitz?
[10:27:48] <arschmitz> yes
[10:28:35] <arschmitz> things like focus outline link underlines any sort of visual queue you need to be very careful about
[10:29:01] <arschmitz> i would not say there is a hard rule on anything
[10:29:06] <kristyjy> yeah I can make an accessibility section that sounds good
[10:29:12] <arschmitz> just need to be careful abd manage user expectations
[10:29:21] <arschmitz> for keyboard navigation and visual queues
[10:33:36] <sfrisk> yup
[10:34:07] <sfrisk> okay, so any updates on table styling?
[10:34:09] <sfrisk> pr
[10:35:53] <arschmitz> well michael is not here
[10:35:57] <arschmitz> i did check it out
[10:36:12] <arschmitz> he started to extract the scroll indication but its not done its there twice right now
[10:36:32] <arschmitz> So that PR needs some work still
[10:39:41] <sfrisk> okay
[10:40:11] <sfrisk> um, any other updates we should talk about?
[10:40:16] <sfrisk> that people want to bring up
[10:42:31] <slayslot> Not that I can think of.
[10:42:52] <sfrisk> okay then
[10:42:58] <sfrisk> see you guys in css-chassis!
