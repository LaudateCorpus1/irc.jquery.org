[14:07:47] <arschmitz> Hi all meeting time
[14:07:54] <cogwurx> Hello!
[14:07:58] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:08:36] <arschmitz> I don't have any type of update still waiting to get laptop back with changelog
[14:09:00] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I pushed the listview refresh PR.
[14:09:07] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8489
[14:09:14] <arschmitz> There has been a bunch of infighting with different Apple divisions over fixing it
[14:09:31] <arschmitz> Awesome I'll look at that adapt
[14:09:33] <gabrielschulhof> My 5 year old Dell is still going strong :)
[14:09:36] <arschmitz> ASAP
[14:09:57] <arschmitz> So is my old Mac which is what I'm using for now
[14:10:06] <arschmitz> Brand new one not so much
[14:10:15] <cogwurx> my 4 year old Lenovo is still awesome
[14:10:18] <gabrielschulhof> Right, yeah, but it's got the changelog, eh?
[14:10:36] <arschmitz> Yup
[14:10:43] <arschmitz> And way to far along to start over
[14:11:01] <arschmitz> The raw one is almost 900 commits
[14:11:17] <arschmitz> I had it down to under 300 lol
[14:12:00] <arschmitz> Hopefully I'll have it before the next meeting
[14:13:02] <arschmitz> Jasper are you here ??
[14:13:34] <arschmitz> Guess not
[14:13:51] <arschmitz> My name autocomplete does not seem to be working either lol
[14:14:17] <arschmitz> Cogwurx any demo updates?
[14:14:33] <cogwurx> unfortunately no...
[14:14:52] <cogwurx> a side project came alive again and have been focusing on that
[14:14:58] <arschmitz> Ok
[14:15:11] <arschmitz> Apsedehal are you around?
[14:15:27] <cogwurx> Though I looked at the list the other day and if I understand correctly the demo updates is mostly content updates?
[14:16:49] <arschmitz> Yes I think so need to revist the list
[14:17:01] <arschmitz> But any visual updates are welcome too
[14:17:22] <arschmitz> I know you had said you wanted to clean up the landing page image a bit too
[14:17:46] <cogwurx> did I? the new one that I created earlier this year?
[14:17:52] <cgack> sorry i'm late
[14:17:57] <cogwurx> slcaker
[14:18:03] <cogwurx> *slacker
[14:18:03] <arschmitz> Yes but just layout not the image itself
[14:18:11] <cogwurx> ah okay
[14:21:04] <arschmitz> Cgack any update?
[14:21:50] <cgack> for the group... I've been out teaching last week and next. I should get back to normalcy starting the week of the 8 August
[14:22:40] <cgack> once we get the changelog, are we going to drop an alpha release and blogpost?
[14:22:57] <arschmitz> Yes
[14:23:10] <cgack> rock on! so close
[14:23:58] <arschmitz> Yup and good luck with the teaching
[14:25:08] <cogwurx> to him or his students?
[14:25:17] <cogwurx> sorry @cgack
[14:25:37] <cgack> LOLOLOLOLOL  i need it more than the students
[14:26:14] <cogwurx> You'll do great
[14:26:39] <cgack> thanks cogwurx
[14:28:00] <arschmitz> I meant cgack but maybe I should have the students lol
[14:28:11] <cgack> :)
[14:28:18] <arschmitz> So I don't have anything else sadly in a bit of a holding pattern on laptop
[14:28:41] <gabrielschulhof> I have one thing.
[14:28:57] <gabrielschulhof> We have addFirstLastClasses which is used by listview and collapsibleSet.
[14:28:58] <arschmitz> Ok
[14:29:14] <gabrielschulhof> Obviously collapsibleSet is on its way out, so how should I deal with that?
[14:29:18] <arschmitz> Soon to just be list view
[14:29:23] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, exactly.
[14:29:37] <gabrielschulhof> So, I'm inclined to copy the code from the extension into listview.
[14:29:47] <gabrielschulhof> But we're still shipping collapsible and collapsibleSet, right?
[14:29:54] <arschmitz> Yes but I would wait till after release
[14:29:58] <arschmitz> Yup
[14:30:10] <gabrielschulhof> So, maybe I should just mark that as deprecated.
[14:30:29] <gabrielschulhof> Can't really move it to listview.backcompat.js though, because we need it in non-backcompat cases too.
[14:30:43] <gabrielschulhof> I'll make a comment, I guess.
[14:31:00] <gabrielschulhof> That cool?
[14:32:08] <gabrielschulhof> We should probably also deprecate that extension, if it was even public.
[14:33:39] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, and another question, now that I seem to have gotten vagrant up and running for the API docs.
[14:33:56] <gabrielschulhof> Against which branch should I work? We now have 1-5 and 1.5 and master. So, ... 1.5?
[14:34:44] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, and there's classes-option. I guess I'm a bit behind on the latest API docs developments.
[14:36:10] <arschmitz> Maine repo master
[14:36:15] <arschmitz> Docs 1.5
[14:36:33] <arschmitz> Apsedehal submitted or for classes on all widgets
[14:37:01] <arschmitz> I just need to test it but don't have jquery-who-content on current laptop
[14:38:13] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:38:24] <gabrielschulhof> I'll start looking at 1.5.
[14:38:39] <arschmitz> Sounds great docs are top priority at this point
[14:38:40] <gabrielschulhof> ... and that table PR.
[14:39:35] <arschmitz> Getting in all the depreciations and Api changes in
[14:41:48] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. I'll start poring over things.
[14:42:03] <gabrielschulhof> I just dunno how this jives with apsdehal's classes PR.
[14:42:13] <gabrielschulhof> I guess I'll update everything but the classes option.
[14:42:54] <arschmitz> Yup
[14:43:05] <arschmitz> And I think that pr is about ready
[14:43:10] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Great!
[14:43:15] <arschmitz> I reviewed on github but can't test it
[14:43:38] <arschmitz> So if you are happy with it and it works you can land it first to avoid conflicts
[14:45:07] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:45:11] <gabrielschulhof> Oh.
[14:45:27] <gabrielschulhof> NM. It's against 1.5-dev
[14:45:31] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll land it.
[14:47:53] <gabrielschulhof> Nice! I am able to upload to vagrant.api.jquerymobile.com
[15:06:10] <gabrielschulhof> I gotta go. See y'all next week!
