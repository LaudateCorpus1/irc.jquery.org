[09:00:40] * kborchers lurks
[09:01:13] <jzaefferer> just added tj_vantoll to the team list
[09:02:48] <jzaefferer> What does "Can we do this by 1.10?" mean?
[09:02:56] <jzaefferer> before or after?
[09:03:00] <tj_vantoll> Thanks.  And I'm here.
[09:03:24] <jzaefferer> Regarding grunt 0.4 plugins
[09:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> by = before
[09:04:19] <jzaefferer> I need to review https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-css/pull/17
[09:04:33] <jzaefferer> well, review, merge and publish
[09:04:44] <mikesherov> hi
[09:05:01] <jzaefferer> mikesherov might be able to say more about grunt stuffs
[09:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...that's use legacyhelpers.
[09:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> We should try to avoid that.
[09:05:28] <mikesherov> right, grunt-compare-size was using the gzip helper
[09:05:40] <mikesherov> I replaced it by using require('gzip-js') directly
[09:06:23] <jzaefferer> well, grunt-css is doing that already
[09:06:31] <jzaefferer> he's using the concat helper
[09:07:00] <Dave_Stein> .
[09:07:00] <mikesherov> right, same thing
[09:07:06] <rxaviers> sorry, I had a power outage here. Im just back
[09:07:10] <mikesherov> concat hepler should be pulled out
[09:07:35] <mikesherov> the legacyhelpers plugin is dumb as doornails
[09:07:38] <mikesherov> easy replacements
[09:07:50] <jzaefferer> this should just work with 0.4? https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-html/blob/master/tasks/html.js
[09:08:08] <jzaefferer> maybe have to update spawn usage here: https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-html/blob/master/lib/htmllint.js
[09:08:11] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov : I should be coding the rest of draggable between today and tomorrow. When I *finish* there will probably be failing unit tests stlil so at that point I just go and fix my code to pass right?
[09:08:23] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: yes
[09:08:29] <mikesherov> only fix code, not tests
[09:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, utils is now util.
[09:08:53] <mikesherov> utils is now util, spawn callback second param is no longer just stdout
[09:09:00] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: Cool thought so - was just sanity checking
[09:09:11] <mikesherov> you need to reference the stdout property of the second param… result.stfdout
[09:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> stuffedout :-P
[09:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> I have a PR for grunt-cli https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli/pull/8
[09:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> To make it work with jqueryui.com.
[09:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> Waiting for someone to test on Windows.
[09:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> Dave is trying to test, but he's struggling to get grunt working again.
[09:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that we can get all the content repos updated in time (because of grunt-wordpress)
[09:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> But hopefully we can get the code repo updated.
[09:13:03] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:13:17] <jzaefferer> I'll update my two plugins this week
[09:13:37] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: If I work on UI today I'll need to get grunt working on my windows machine. Am I already screwed?
[09:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> No, you should be fine with UI.
[09:14:02] <jzaefferer> we can replace grunt-junit with https://github.com/sbrandwoo/grunt-qunit-junit - that works with 0.4
[09:14:05] <Dave_Stein> kk
[09:14:37] <Dave_Stein> I'm off for lunch. I'll be back later while working on UI
[09:14:43] <Dave_Stein> or tomorrow if that's the case
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's try to get everything updated and we can test in a branch.
[09:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to run through the entire release process just to verify.
[09:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Update on download builder?
[09:16:29] <rxaviers> yeap, last week we had an issue with long urls on download builder
[09:16:48] <rxaviers> it's solved now by compressing the GET params with lzma when needed
[09:17:27] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, pointed some more todos and I still need to work on some of them.
[09:17:54] <jzaefferer> the usual :-)
[09:17:57] <rxaviers> but, it should not take long
[09:17:58] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> I started working on sites this week.
[09:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll be splitting my time between UI and sites for the remainder of the year.
[09:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we can get everything on to the new-css branch.
[09:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> I was able to talk to 47m yesterday and get some answers to design questions.
[09:21:22] <jzaefferer> Nice
[09:21:54] <jzaefferer> I'll look into dialog test failures. At least one Firefox issue is reproducible locally
[09:22:35] <jzaefferer> looks like its all position-related
[09:22:47] <mikesherov> so, I want to work on fixing the testswarm iframe bug once and for all soon
[09:23:04] <mikesherov> by not running the tests in an IFRAME to begin with
[09:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> yes, please
[09:23:24] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: keep in touch with Krinkle on that iframe stuff
[09:23:34] <mikesherov> it's a big story, so yeah, I don't want to step on his toes
[09:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> We're kind of stuck with indeterminate progressbars.
[09:24:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what's wrong with implementing the demos I suggested?
[09:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> We do the right thing with the ARIA properties, but most screen readers just don't know what to do with it.
[09:25:09] <jzaefferer> our current demos are just terrible in general
[09:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> What demos?
[09:25:31] <jzaefferer> If Firefox+NVDA doesn't do anything useful, we should hacks0r it
[09:25:42] <jzaefferer> I suggested a few to kborchers, not sure where I posted that
[09:26:12] <jzaefferer> I hope it wasn't just in IRC
[09:26:15] <kborchers> jzaefferer: it was in IRC
[09:26:19] <jzaefferer> gah
[09:26:35] <jzaefferer> kborchers: did you copy them somewhere?
[09:26:46] <kborchers> "Download Progress Dialog" fired by user interaction (button click)
[09:27:28] <kborchers> or some sort of "Downloading resources thing" but i would  have to check logs … i did not write them down like a dummy :/
[09:27:40] <jzaefferer> hehe, both of us
[09:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we can discuss demos later.
[09:28:55] <jzaefferer> Adium logs suuuuuck
[09:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to figure out what we're doing about the whole demo system.
[09:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> So, on to selectmenu.
[09:29:29] <jzaefferer> Well, if a demo makes no sense at all when you view it in a screenreader, it sucks :-)
[09:29:43] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's not a demo problem though.
[09:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's a code problem.
[09:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> We can't fix that in a demo and then have it be broken whenever people use it for real.
[09:30:20] <jzaefferer> well
[09:30:22] <jzaefferer> some other time
[09:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> Right now selectmenu supports two styles: popup and dropdown.
[09:32:42] <fnagel> yes
[09:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> We need to switch to only one of them, because using one makes other options strange.
[09:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> The question is which should we default to.
[09:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer wants to default to popup because it's easier to convert a popup to a dropdown.
[09:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> That logic seems fine to me.
[09:33:35] <scott_gonzalez> But that shouldn't be the main reason.
[09:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> What do we think people will expect?
[09:34:07] <fnagel> Good question, I know from my support on the "old" selectmenu that most people use popup
[09:34:10] <jzaefferer> fnagel: what's the default of your olde/standalone version?
[09:34:30] <jzaefferer> that sounds like a good reason to default to popup
[09:34:38] <fnagel> old default is dropdown
[09:35:28] <jzaefferer> kborchers: http://irc.jquery.com/%23jqueryui-dev/%23jqueryui-dev_20121213.log.html#t05:20:18
[09:35:47] <fnagel> By the way, Ive implemented a branch with popup style default, see: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/selectmenu-popup
[09:35:53] <jzaefferer> so did popup just cause more trouble, therefore more support requests?
[09:35:59] <kborchers> jzaefferer: cool, thanks
[09:36:11] <fnagel> its pretty easy to have dropdown by using options and callbacks, see default demo
[09:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> The question is what do more users want?
[09:36:43] <scott_gonzalez> The majority of users shouldn't need to customize something like select.
[09:36:48] <jzaefferer> This is still complicated enough that we should put together an extension: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/7d6e65c30f4036b9630a709e72d012a48d98324d/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[09:38:14] <fnagel> I already mentioned I assume most use popup but I would expect a dropdown style select as this is the native behaviour
[09:38:28] <jzaefferer> on OSX, the popup style is the default
[09:39:04] <fnagel> ahh ok, on windows its dropdown
[09:39:08] <jzaefferer> well, on Chrome and Safari
[09:39:16] <jzaefferer> Firefox does dropdown anyway
[09:39:31] <kborchers> jzaefferer: a quick note on the demos, we were stuck because if we hack the readers using aria-valuetext, NVDA and JAWS will be "fixed" but then voiceover is broken as it already gets it right and that makes it announce the indeterminate progressbar twice :/
[09:40:24] <jzaefferer> kborchers: VoiceOver on OSX is generally pretty shit, so I'd rather fix JAWS and NVDA. You can always cancel double announcements, but can't get something silent to speak...
[09:40:31] <jzaefferer> *shitty
[09:40:36] <fnagel> on win its dropdown on IE, FF and chrome
[09:40:47] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok
[09:41:49] <jzaefferer> fnagel scott_gonzalez: so let's just default to dropdown and build popup as an extension (later/if enough people ask for it)?
[09:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm good with that.
[09:42:13] <jzaefferer> would be consistent with the old default and most native selects
[09:42:53] <jzaefferer> icons: button is okay?
[09:43:21] <jzaefferer> of the suggestions Scott (king of naming!) made, that seems the best
[09:43:27] <fnagel> Ok, lets do that. Any example for an extension, I could implement it as Im pretty sure people will ask
[09:44:00] <fnagel> I agree, button seems the best
[09:44:04] <jzaefferer> fnagel: Scott has a few extensions here: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions
[09:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> Don't look at those :-P
[09:44:18] <jzaefferer> Once the plugins site is done, we can properly tag and publish extensions there
[09:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> I need to rewrite them to use 1.9
[09:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> Look at the bottom of the tabs file in 1-9-stable.
[09:46:25] <fnagel> You think of the deprecated additions?
[09:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:47:28] <fnagel> Where should an extension like popup be added?
[09:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> In your own repo.
[09:48:11] <fnagel> Ok, so it should be not an official addition?
[09:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have official additions.
[09:48:27] <fnagel> ok
[09:50:25] <fnagel> You said we need a case for option icons in _setOption, can you take a look if this is ok? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/selectmenu-popup/ui/jquery.ui.selectmenu.js#L390
[09:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> We usually only handle the key once.
[09:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> So you can remove based on the current option and add based on the value.
[09:53:39] <fnagel> I know, but how to remove the old CSS class when _super will set the option with the new value?
[09:54:31] <fnagel> Or is it fine to have a case (for icons), than _super and than all other cases?
[09:54:32] <scott_gonzalez> Just do it before you call _super(), like you're already doing.
[09:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the order can be whatever makes sense for the widget.
[09:55:09] <fnagel> ok, I will push this asap
[09:55:27] <fnagel> any other points to discuss? what about a11y?
[09:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer?
[10:00:05] <jzaefferer> On my phone, IRC client crashed. What was the question?
[10:00:52] <fnagel> any other points to discuss? what about a11y?
[10:00:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^
[10:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What fnagel just said :-)
[10:01:23] <jzaefferer> We need to announce the value on focus
[10:02:06] <jzaefferer> Hans suggested fake content changes to trigger the live region
[10:02:07] <jzaefferer> Haven't yet tried that
[10:04:26] <jzaefferer> fnagel: want to give that a try based on my branch?
[10:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> Do people still have time to continue this meeting?
[10:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> I have some tickets I wanted to go over.
[10:05:38] <tj_vantoll> I'll be around.
[10:05:39] <fnagel> I will try to. What was on your mind? A accessable hidden span within the button element?
[10:07:05] <jzaefferer> Nothing hidden. Just aria-live on the button. Already there, but not reliable on focus.
[10:07:56] <fnagel> But what does "fake content changes" mean?
[10:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> Can we move that discussion to -dev?
[10:09:20] <fnagel> Hans wrote something about "removing and adding the text or maybe even adding an &nbsp; entity would do the trick", so I thought of something like I proposed
[10:09:42] <fnagel> Ok. Jörn?
[10:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to bugs.
[10:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8912
[10:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> Slider: stop event is not triggered if mouse moved out of iframe
[10:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure we can fix this.
[10:11:24] <tj_vantoll> That's what I was thinking.
[10:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> Browsers just don't fire mouseup if you move out of the window.
[10:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov jzaefferer
[10:12:33] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[10:12:37] <mikesherov> browsers huh
[10:12:41] <mikesherov> they suck
[10:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so close cantfix
[10:12:52] <tj_vantoll> Need like a windowleave event.
[10:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Heh, yeah, even with that, it'd still be a mess.
[10:13:21] <mikesherov> yeah, because of focus
[10:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> mousedown, mousemove, windowleave, windowenter, mouseup
[10:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, next
[10:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8914
[10:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> .css( "color", "transparent" ) fails in oldIE
[10:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> This is because of jQuery Color 2.0.
[10:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> We need to special case transparent for color animations.
[10:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> But we shouldn't be doing anything for .css() in that case.
[10:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that jQuery Color implements the special casing inside a cssHook
[10:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[10:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll come back to that one.
[10:19:19] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8905
[10:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> Accordion: setting active option doesn't trigger scrolling to the new panel
[10:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> This used to happen because we would set focus to the header on activation.
[10:19:39] <scott_gonzalez> We no longer do that.
[10:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> Which I believe is correct behavior.
[10:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> If the user manually activates it, then their focus is in the right place.
[10:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> If this is a scripted activation, it shouldn't move the user's focus.
[10:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> Which is the case in the provided fiddle.
[10:20:50] <tj_vantoll> Pretty easily added if someone needs that behavior.
[10:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> If they want to move the user's focus, they should do so explicitly.
[10:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone disagree?
[10:22:07] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I g2g.. doing reviews this and last week, so been mostly MIA. I'll be out of the weeds next week.
[10:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, closed that ticket as notabug.
[10:23:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8420
[10:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker: show multiple week numbers?
[10:24:10] <tj_vantoll> The native week pickers in Canary and Opera do not do the whole "1/2" thing.
[10:24:13] <tj_vantoll> Canary - https://twitter.com/tjvantoll/status/277250359485931520/photo/1.
[10:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> So this is a request to have the showWeek option show multiple week numbers if firstDay causes multiple weeks to show up on a row.
[10:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Right, I had never seen this before.
[10:24:43] <tj_vantoll> I actually like how Opera handles this.
[10:24:49] <tj_vantoll> http://jsfiddle.net/urGQH/
[10:25:14] <tj_vantoll> Anyways I had never seen this either.
[10:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..so you like that Opera forces the week to start on Monday?
[10:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, that makes sense for a week picker.
[10:30:39] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I like that Opera shifts columns so that Monday is first.  Canary's implementation seems weird for a week picker because when you highlight a row the selection spans rows.
[10:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to keep this closed, but tell him we'll accept a patch that provide a hook for him to add this behavior outside of the plugin.
[10:31:46] <Krinkle> mikesherov: PRs welcome on the iframe stuff. I have looked into it a lot, but no code changes. I'll review/merge whatever you come up with.
[10:34:18] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Agreed. Seems reasonable to simply refactor so that there's a method to generate those.
[10:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I left a comment about that.
[10:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll end the meeting there, since we're 35 minutes over.
[10:37:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
