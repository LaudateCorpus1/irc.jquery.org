[01:01:38] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[01:01:59] <Kangsik> Yep.
[01:02:23] <_|Nix|_> This is the web-ui-fw meeting, where we discuss 1.5.0 style option removal.
[01:02:25] <Minkyeong> Hi again
[01:02:49] <_|Nix|_> How is everybody doing?
[01:02:49] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Did you check new commit added to PR-7348?
[01:03:28] <_|Nix|_> Very nice!
[01:03:35] <_|Nix|_> That's exactly what I was thinking.
[01:03:59] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Kangsik submitted changes as following your comments.
[01:06:12] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. The PR is now perfect.
[01:06:45] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Ah~ Good!
[01:06:56] <Hyunsook> Kangsik: Good job! ^^
[01:07:07] <_|Nix|_> :+1:
[01:07:26] <_|Nix|_> The next step is to do the API docs.
[01:07:33] <Hyunsook> Yes, right.
[01:07:42] <Kangsik> Hyunsook, _|Nix|_: :-)
[01:07:44] <Hyunsook> ... my team didn't create a PR on API repo yet.
[01:08:40] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: We try to submit the PR before next meeting.
[01:09:38] <_|Nix|_> Very cool! Looking forward to it.
[01:09:56] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: ^^
[01:10:12] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: BTW: Found a minor typo: ".ui-corenr.none"
[01:10:49] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Oh!! Thank you....
[01:10:49] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348/files#diff-11b56edf2fb47597bf0b91c002440bc1R608
[01:10:59] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: NP! Good work!
[01:11:03] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: I should fix it.
[01:11:35] <_|Nix|_> OK. Looking good so far. Have you given any thoughts to which might be the next widget you'd like to tackle?
[01:12:41] <Hyunsook> Hmmmm...... checkboxradio? or..
[01:13:05] <_|Nix|_> Checkboxradio is not a bad idea.
[01:13:28] <_|Nix|_> It should work the same way as button.
[01:13:37] <_|Nix|_> i.e., via data-wrapper-class.
[01:14:22] <_|Nix|_> ... in fact, IINM, the same CSS can be used for checkboxradio as well, because the CSS is not widget-specific.
[01:15:04] <_|Nix|_> I'm wondering if it might be worth adding the widgets to the existing PR, and adding a checklist.
[01:15:35] <_|Nix|_> Like, [âœ“
[01:15:45] <_|Nix|_> ] button, [ ] checkboxradio, [ ] etc.
[01:16:06] <_|Nix|_> ... and then, as we make progress, we can check off one item at a time.
[01:16:41] <Hyunsook> Ok
[01:16:49] <_|Nix|_> I'll talk to uGoMobi about it.
[01:17:01] <Hyunsook> Ok, thanks~
[01:17:35] <_|Nix|_> Great! Do we have any other topics?
[01:18:04] <Hyunsook> I want to know uGoMobi's thought for the next widget.
[01:18:28] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: I'll answer the email where he tells us he cannot join the meeting.
[01:18:30] <Hyunsook> Hmm. I think we already told all topics.
[01:18:44] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: OK. Let's discuss this in email over the course of the week.
[01:18:47] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Thanks! ^^
[01:19:06] <Hyunsook> OK~
[01:19:52] <Hyunsook> Have a good week ~
[01:20:09] <_|Nix|_> Alright. Thanks a lot for helping out, and have a good week/weekend, all!
[01:20:37] <Minkyeong> Have a nice week&end :)
[01:20:40] <Kangsik> Have a good day. :-)
