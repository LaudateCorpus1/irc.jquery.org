[09:07:12] <gibson042> who's here?
[09:07:15] <arthurvr> I am
[09:07:35] <markelog> .
[09:07:35] <b-ot> markelog: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:10:10] <timmywil> Ok, thanks for being here all. We're still trucking away on 3.0 issues. I think we've covered most of the issues that needed review. Are there any that anyone wants to discuss today?
[09:10:57] <gibson042> I don't think I have anything new for this week
[09:11:13] <arthurvr> I donâ€™t too, so that was a short meeting :)
[09:11:40] <timmywil> One cool thing is the :visible performance improvement that landed https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/315
[09:11:55] <timmywil> gibson042: when could we see a Sizzle release?
[09:12:00] <arthurvr> Ya nice work :-)
[09:12:35] <timmywil> Which issues are blocking Sizzle?
[09:12:45] <gibson042> assuming me on the issues, 2.2.0 in 2-3 weeks
[09:13:10] <timmywil> I think we're down to 2, right?
[09:13:17] <timmywil> but one of them was kinda big
[09:13:18] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/315 https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/316 https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/311
[09:13:32] <markelog> wow, that is a lot
[09:13:33] <gibson042> scratch 315
[09:13:42] <gibson042> that's the one you just did
[09:13:50] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/311 is potentially big
[09:13:55] <m_gol> present
[09:14:13] <gibson042> but I think very doable
[09:14:57] <timmywil> agreed
[09:15:05] <markelog> do we have a progress with data/deferred issues?
[09:15:24] <timmywil> what was it, we were going to add setDocument call to superMatcher and move the one in the constructor?
[09:15:59] <timmywil> gibson042: would you like me to take either one of those?
[09:16:25] <gibson042> you're welcome to if you've got the itch
[09:16:29] <gibson042> discussion here: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-dev/default_%23jquery-dev_20150126.log.html#t10:51:30
[09:16:51] <timmywil> Ok, I'll take 311 then
[09:17:07] <timmywil> You wanna do 316?
[09:17:12] <gibson042> but at any rate, I think Sizzle 2.2.0 will be the one for jQuery 3.0, at least the beta
[09:17:17] <gibson042> yep
[09:17:28] <timmywil> right, sounds good
[09:18:02] <timmywil> m_gol: I haven't gotten to data changes yet.
[09:18:06] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1709 which can't be solved until sizzle is updated
[09:18:10] <gibson042> markelog: did you have any comments for the deferred PR
[09:18:30] <markelog> nope, was busy with other stuff ((
[09:18:36] <gibson042> right about #1709, but I'm also considering just making the Sizzle caches cloneNode-safe
[09:18:55] <gibson042> but either way, a sizzle update is required
[09:20:07] <timmywil> show/hide is currently assigned to gibson042, but I think m_gol or markelog had offered to take a stab at it?
[09:20:17] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1767
[09:20:28] <markelog> right, i just want to make sure we will have time on it, so we wouldn't release jquery and sizzle simultaneously
[09:21:12] <markelog> 1767 is on gibson042, but i will continue after that
[09:21:35] <gibson042> don't consider my current locks exclusive
[09:21:51] <gibson042> if anyone has the time and inclination, I will yield
[09:22:04] <gibson042> but will otherwise deliver
[09:22:25] <markelog> okay )
[09:22:55] <timmywil> markelog: what was it you were going to do? I remember we had talked about using [hidden] where available and something else.
[09:23:10] <markelog> basically https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2057
[09:23:23] <markelog> investigation and simplification if possible
[09:24:47] <markelog> i have like couple tickets before this
[09:26:06] <timmywil> Ok, we'll keep the meeting short(er) this week. Seems like we all know what we're doing for a bit. Thanks everyone!
