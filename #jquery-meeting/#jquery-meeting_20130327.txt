[09:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> There's an agenda that we update every week.
[09:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> And with that, let's get started.
[09:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Download builder update?
[09:04:31] <Dave_Stein> cool thx
[09:05:01] <rxaviers> no more bugs opened after the last ones were fixed
[09:05:10] <rxaviers> Im working on the grunt duplication
[09:05:16] <rxaviers> thanks for answering my gist https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5253603
[09:05:32] <rxaviers> I have replied to you
[09:06:29] <rxaviers> and thanks for closing that style issue, about the table
[09:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so my comment wasn't clear at all.
[09:06:52] <rxaviers> ohoh which
[09:07:03] <scott_gonzalez> I meant we can continue to keep the tests out of download.
[09:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> But keep them in release.
[09:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can add them to download.
[09:07:23] <rxaviers> Ah ok.. So, we dont touch the pre-release
[09:07:24] <rxaviers> alright
[09:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have strong feelings either way regarding the download.
[09:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> But we should keep them in the release.
[09:08:17] <rxaviers> Ok, so that last quote is basically: keep things as they are.
[09:08:24] <rxaviers> alright
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason I didn't get notified when you commented.
[09:08:41] <rxaviers> yeap, me neither
[09:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't see the option to watch that gist.
[09:09:20] <rxaviers> I let you know in IRC whenever I comment there
[09:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:09:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's annoying that notifications/watching has disappeared.
[09:09:41] <rxaviers> So, .jshintrc is not whitelisted, that's why it's not in download. Should we add it?
[09:09:48] <rxaviers> (yeap)
[09:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> We need it if the tests are included.
[09:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't need it if the tests aren't included.
[09:10:41] <rxaviers> (I created the gist and didnt receive a notification of your msg, maybe it's a temporary buggy thing)
[09:11:02] <rxaviers> ok
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> Might as well just whitelist it instead of having logic based on whether tests are included.
[09:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> But I'll leave that decision (whether to write actual logic) up to you.
[09:11:43] <rxaviers> ok
[09:12:36] <rxaviers> all from my side
[09:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Got any update for effects?
[09:13:43] <mikesherov> Yes, I do
[09:13:50] <mikesherov> I made most of the changes from our review
[09:14:07] <mikesherov> Myself and Petro are going to wrap that up tomorrow at SNAP's hackathon
[09:14:24] <mikesherov> I should be able to get it to a re-reviewable state by next wednesday
[09:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> I can't wait for that to land.
[09:15:52] <mikesherov> the only issue is what we've discussed… nailing down which effects are supposed to modify containers layouts
[09:16:06] <mikesherov> because then I need to add animating the placeholders for certain animations
[09:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok, just ping me if you have any questions about that.
[09:16:26] <mikesherov> which will be quite hairy actually, but will work.
[09:16:29] <mikesherov> That's the end of the update
[09:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't looked at interactions at all this week.
[09:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's been non-stop site work.
[09:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we've got lots of sites deployed, people keep asking for updates :-/
[09:18:18] <tj_vantoll> patcheswelcome :)
[09:18:32] <scott_gonzalez> But I know mikesherov is still working through the existing bugs.
[09:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Seriously. Aren't these other people developers too?!?
[09:18:59] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm mainly foused on draggabke
[09:19:03] <mikesherov> now that I have a test suite
[09:19:39] <mikesherov> thanks to Dave_Stein
[09:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have much else to discuss this week.
[09:20:59] <Dave_Stein> huzzah
[09:21:05] <Dave_Stein> yeah i saw on the agenda things are still on review
[09:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> Any other topics?
[09:21:11] <tj_vantoll> Have to take off a little early.  Just fyi I made it through my triage pass of sortable and will start to look into the classes option a bit later this week.
[09:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: That's great, the mobile team just had a discussion about theming and it'd be great to be able to discuss your findings with them.
[09:21:48] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov, do you need my help anywhere this week?
[09:22:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'll be working on pointer event stuff more tonight … that's fun beast :)
[09:22:37] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Will do.  I'll probably chat with you at some point before I get too far into it.  Got to go.
[09:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks tj_vantoll
[09:22:54] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: nope, not at the moment
[09:22:57] <mikesherov> I'm good, thanks!
[09:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, it's tricky.
[09:23:17] <rxaviers> kborchers, just curious, is your pointer stuff out there in any repo?
[09:23:40] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez, so sortable is also on hold, pending review?
[09:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: It's in the interactions-pointer branch
[09:24:06] <kborchers> rxaviers: sort of … the start of it is here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/interactions-pointer but very much just a start with a lot of work to do
[09:24:19] <rxaviers> ;) thks
[09:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it.
[09:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> See everyone back in -dev.
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
