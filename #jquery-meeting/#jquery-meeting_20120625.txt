[08:50:44] * DaveMethvin turns on lights
[08:59:31] <jzaefferer> its that time again!
[09:00:44] <DaveMethvin> time to play, WHEEL .... OF .... FORTUNE!
[09:01:05] <rwaldron> Hi!
[09:01:08] <rwaldron> (brb)
[09:01:45] <timmywil> o
[09:01:46] <timmywil> i
[09:02:07] <DaveMethvin> wow we got a lot done in the past week
[09:02:20] <DaveMethvin> and when i say "we" I mean "you" guys
[09:02:26] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:02:49] <jzaefferer> about those IE8 issues: afaik Krinkle has experimented with window.open to replace the embedded iframe on TestSwarm, but I have no idea how that went
[09:03:05] <DaveMethvin> and jzaefferer i don't know if that is the cause
[09:03:09] <DaveMethvin> i just can't tell
[09:03:11] <Krinkle> working on it, will push branch tonight
[09:03:22] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: right, but we can give it a try
[09:03:27] <Krinkle> seems to be working locally in Chrome, don
[09:03:44] <Krinkle> seems to be working locally in Chrome, don't know if it satisfies the jqueryy/core tests failing in IE8
[09:03:56] <DaveMethvin> when stabbing in the dark, be sure sure to use a sharp knife :)
[09:05:23] <DaveMethvin> so any feedback you've seen on the beta?
[09:05:33] <DaveMethvin> mainly a few gripes about deprecated stuff
[09:05:38] <DaveMethvin> and that one with siblings
[09:05:51] <DaveMethvin> which timmywil triaged already, easy to fix
[09:06:10] <DaveMethvin> not sure how we don't have a unit test that would fail on that!
[09:06:29] <timmywil> If someone else could pick that up, that would be great
[09:06:41] <timmywil> I'm working on the selector issue and a website at the same time
[09:06:57] <DaveMethvin> i'll get it timmywil
[09:07:03] <gibson042> yeah, I should have put that in when I fixed the parents of empty set issue a while back
[09:07:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: thanks!
[09:07:45] <DaveMethvin> so it seems pretty good all around
[09:07:59] <DaveMethvin> i was glad to see someone testing and reporting bugs
[09:08:05] <DaveMethvin> so RARE :P
[09:08:43] <DaveMethvin> we did have a few things that we could have removed outright in 1.8 but then it seemed like it made more sense to put it in one big compat plugin for 1.9
[09:09:14] <DaveMethvin> i love the idea of deprecated.js
[09:09:24] <rwaldron> gnarf ^^
[09:09:26] <rwaldron> +1
[09:09:43] <DaveMethvin> it won't get everything that's deprecated but does allow people to build a cleaner version closer to 1.9
[09:09:54] <rwaldron> truth
[09:09:58] <rwaldron> -jQuery.browser
[09:10:50] <DaveMethvin> any issues that people want to discuss?
[09:11:25] <DaveMethvin> other than docs i think we're in pretty good shape
[09:11:43] <DaveMethvin> the ticket count is way down
[09:12:04] <DaveMethvin> prolly half the open ones are ie 6/7/8 bugs
[09:12:26] <DaveMethvin> if i had a magic wand ... o wait i do!
[09:13:01] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: what is your take on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11961
[09:13:02] <rworth> I could use some help getting the new api.jquery.com wrapped up
[09:13:13] <DaveMethvin> what do you need rworth?
[09:13:17] <rworth> we need to make demos work, and do the xml and jsonp web services
[09:13:25] <DaveMethvin> is it in the repo?
[09:13:29] <rworth> everything else looks pretty good
[09:13:37] <DaveMethvin> the problem i was having was getting it set up locally
[09:13:45] <rworth> you don't need a local setup
[09:13:48] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[09:13:49] <mikesherov> LATE
[09:13:51] <DaveMethvin> that makes it doable
[09:14:05] <rworth> just grab the repo and deploy to legacy.api.jquery.com
[09:14:06] <DaveMethvin> put a fiver in the jar mikesherov :)
[09:14:32] <rworth> add to /etc/hosts
[09:14:34] <DaveMethvin> rworth: ok since i have some docs changes anyway i'll see what i can do  there
[09:14:42] <rworth> 205.186.144.58 legacy.api.jquery.com
[09:14:50] <rworth> awesome, thanks DaveMethvin
[09:15:25] <DaveMethvin> any tix on the 1.8 list that need discussion?
[09:15:58] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: would you be able to look at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11809
[09:16:14] <DaveMethvin> we're taking an awfully long path for text setters
[09:16:27] <rworth> might have to work with a number of folks ( jzaefferer nacin kswedberg scott_gonzalez ) to do the xml and jsonp services, as it is likely a combination of things including xslt and xml via grunt-wordpress and theme changes in web-base-template
[09:16:35] <gibson042> sure
[09:16:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: not sure yet
[09:16:42] <rworth> but the iframe demos should be straightforward
[09:16:54] <timmywil> I'll assign it to myself
[09:17:51] <DaveMethvin> anyone seen jaubourg lately?
[09:18:04] <DaveMethvin> damn girlfriend
[09:18:06] <rworth> also on local setup DaveMethvin there is a slick install script now, ajpiano and I have run it
[09:18:06] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:18:09] <rworth> I think kborchers too
[09:18:28] <rworth> you'll still be a Windows beta tester, but it's handy (thanks nacin )
[09:18:34] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: he's travelining the usa
[09:18:40] <kborchers> i actually have not run it yet
[09:18:41] <ajpiano> they got into a car accident in the desert (not a joke)
[09:18:49] <ajpiano> but everythig's ok
[09:18:53] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[09:20:35] <DaveMethvin> headlines i don't want to see -- Albuquerque Daily News: "jQuery Ajax author eaten by vultures"
[09:23:16] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: you around?
[09:23:30] <DaveMethvin> there are a few animation tix still open for 1.8 that could use a look
[09:24:34] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11734
[09:24:47] <DaveMethvin> you good with 1.8 deprecation? I just need to update the docs
[09:25:21] <DaveMethvin> although we're still gonna hose $(html, props) if we actually remove it
[09:26:19] <DaveMethvin> any thoughts on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11310?  mikesherov perhaps?
[09:26:27] <DaveMethvin> fake body
[09:29:32] <DaveMethvin> okay, all bug 11310 are assigned now, let me know if you want to bail on a ticket which is np
[09:29:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yea I'm cool with that. May not remove in 1.9 tho
[09:29:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's fine timmywil
[09:29:54] <DaveMethvin> mainly just gives us the option
[09:30:00] <timmywil> agreed
[09:30:44] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then, i think that's everything
[09:30:53] <DaveMethvin> things are looking pretty good i think
[09:32:23] <DaveMethvin> everybody back into -dev! i think they have sandwiches over there
