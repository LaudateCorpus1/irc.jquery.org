[08:59:24] <arschmitz> Hi
[08:59:26] <rxaviers> hello
[09:00:08] <kborchers> hey
[09:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer: Let's start with button.
[09:00:35] <fnagel> Hey, I have not much time today. I will leave in 20min to catch my train
[09:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we can start with any items you have.
[09:01:51] <tj_vantoll> I'm around but in another meeting, so I'll be slow to respond.
[09:02:42] <fnagel> No news, so just let me know if anybody has quetsions regarding selectmenu or calendar
[09:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> So back to button...
[09:04:11] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, fnagel
[09:04:17] <rxaviers> still on datepicker
[09:04:26] <rxaviers> 1316 only waits review right?
[09:04:31] <arschmitz> dont think there is much there this week im working on the spider as jzaefferer asked
[09:04:42] <arschmitz> as far as im aware there has been no further review
[09:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: correct
[09:04:51] <rxaviers> I would like to double check we are not using 1316 for any new implementation?
[09:04:57] <rxaviers> Aside from review fixes obviously
[09:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[09:05:11] <rxaviers> excellent.
[09:05:12] <rxaviers> thanks
[09:05:32] <rxaviers> fnagel, I have a question perhaps for you on my upcoming datepicker work
[09:05:46] <fnagel> ok
[09:05:55] <rxaviers> I need to fix RTL direction. This information will be available on this.options.locale.layoutOrientationCharacterOrder (or any other better name??)
[09:06:20] <fnagel> rxaviers: yes 1316 waits for review
[09:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We decided to only support a string for the locale option.
[09:07:10] <rxaviers> Correct scott_gonzalez. Let me rephrase, assume I have the RTL information from CLDR.
[09:07:21] <rxaviers> I need someone to fix the RTL implementation on the calendar though.
[09:07:28] <rxaviers> I see no code related to it in the new rewrite.
[09:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure it's just a matter of adding a class to the calendar.
[09:08:00] <tj_vantoll> That's fine, but I'm not sure what that has to do with storing information in options.locale.
[09:08:00] <rxaviers> ah great!
[09:08:19] <rxaviers> About options.locale...
[09:08:32] <rxaviers> User will provide locale: "en" or any other locale string.
[09:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[09:08:49] <tj_vantoll> Yes. And we'll default to "en-US"
[09:08:53] <rxaviers> Optionally user can provide locale: {fn1: ..., fn2:...} with all the formatters and parsers needed for datepicker
[09:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:09:03] <scott_gonzalez> We decided not to do that.
[09:09:32] <rxaviers> I misunderstood our decision then
[09:09:33] <rxaviers> Ok
[09:09:59] <rxaviers> So, for spinner user must pass the formatters and parsers. But, for datepicker he won't be able to. Is that correct?
[09:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:10:09] <rxaviers> Ok
[09:10:30] <rxaviers> Are we going to give user the choice to pass a locale on spinner?
[09:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:10:40] <rxaviers> Isnt it too inconsistent?
[09:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Spinner is only sometimes concerned about locale.
[09:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> And locale alone isn't enough.
[09:11:39] <rxaviers> And locale alone isn't enough?
[09:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> A locale cannot represent percentage, for example.
[09:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> Spinner can represent anything that can be converted to a number.
[09:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> A locale does not capture that concept.
[09:12:30] <rxaviers> Ah ok
[09:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> A formatter and a parser does.
[09:12:38] <rxaviers> true
[09:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> Currently we have locale + format.
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> And even that gets us into trouble.
[09:13:03] <rxaviers> it makes sense
[09:13:03] <rxaviers> ok
[09:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> Anything to discuss about Globalize?
[09:16:05] <rxaviers> Number formatter and parser generators are ready for review respectively on:
[09:16:05] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/299
[09:16:05] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/305
[09:16:12] <rxaviers> A quick review would envolve (a) be ok with the generator API (see PR
[09:16:12] <rxaviers> description), (b) be ok with the README documentation.
[09:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, does anyone have anything else to discuss before we talk about 1.11.2?
[09:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get 1.11.2 out next week.
[09:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> I have this ticket as a blocker: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10571
[09:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> There's a PR for it; I've been working with the author to get it ready to land.
[09:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> This one came in last week, looks like it should probably also be a blocker: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10602
[09:22:00] <tj_vantoll> I was just about to link to that.
[09:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> I just marked it as a blocker.
[09:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else that should get into 1.11.2?
[09:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> Or are we good to release as soon as these two issues are fixed?
[09:23:52] <tj_vantoll> This one regressed in 1.11.1: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10590
[09:23:59] <tj_vantoll> But I wouldn't consider it a blocker.
[09:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[09:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not marking that as a blocker :-P
[09:24:46] <tj_vantoll> Exactly
[09:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, sounds like it's just those two.
[09:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> I did have one other thing I wanted to discuss.
[09:25:38] <fnagel> I need to go, bye
[09:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> On the planning wiki, we have tons of plugins that just aren't on our roadmap at all.
[09:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Most of them essentially have no information on them.
[09:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with this is that some of them end up becoming a distraction.
[09:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138086/Taskbar
[09:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling we'll never implement a taskbar widget.
[09:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> Is there any objection to just deleting these pages?
[09:27:31] <kborchers> it might be nice to compile a list of the ones you want to delete first and make sure no one objects
[09:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but before I spent the time going through all the pages (I'm pretty sure FG created several dozen), I wanted to make sure people were ok with the idea.
[09:28:25] <kborchers> yep, definitely ok with deleting the ones we don't intend to implement
[09:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll put together a list and send it to the team.
[09:28:41] <tj_vantoll> +1 deleting
[09:28:50] <rxaviers> +1
[09:28:51] <arschmitz> yeah i think its fine to kill ones that will never happen +1
[09:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> And finally, does anyone feel like they're not making good enough progress on their 1.12.0 tasks?
[09:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> I saw mikesherov making good progress on effects last week :-)
[09:31:14] <tj_vantoll> Slow going on menu from me because of the conference. I'll be back on it tomorrow though. Unless kborchers comes up with an alternative approach :P
[09:31:28] <kborchers> :)
[09:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, he's got better luck getting Chrome to support Pointer Events :-P
[09:31:41] <kborchers> lol
[09:32:01] <kborchers> well i'm still working on both of those ... i like the impossible tasks i guess
[09:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> Somebody's gotta do 'em.
[09:32:34] <kborchers> but tj should not wait on me ... we can always fix it later if we come up with something else
[09:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let's change the markup for menu in every release ;-)
[09:33:14] <kborchers> seems like a good goal .. keep devs on their toes
[09:33:47] <scott_gonzalez> For the next version, we can use definition lists...
[09:34:04] <kborchers> heh
[09:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> We can continue the silliness in -dev.
[09:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
