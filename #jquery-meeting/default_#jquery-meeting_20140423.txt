[09:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz fnagel gnarf kborchers mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:01:32] <jzaefferer> there
[09:01:43] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:48] <fnagel> hi
[09:01:48] <jzaefferer> just started making a list like that...
[09:01:48] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:02:04] <kborchers> hey
[09:03:01] <rxaviers> hello
[09:03:14] <jzaefferer> after last weeks meeting I put a new item on the agenda, about tickets with lots of duplicates
[09:03:25] <jzaefferer> Scott created a report for that: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/41
[09:03:50] <jzaefferer> most of these are about datepicker and interactions
[09:04:04] <jzaefferer> these two autocomplete tickets are the notable exception: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7434 http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6642
[09:04:27] <jzaefferer> both are about three years old, too
[09:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> I created two more reports as well.
[09:04:51] <jzaefferer> anyone interested in tackling those two autocomplete issues?
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> All tickets with multiple duplicates: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/42
[09:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> That was requested by tj_vantoll to make it easier to find closed tickets when a new duplicate comes in.
[09:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> I also created a report of open tickets with >5 comments:  http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/43
[09:06:08] <jzaefferer> those are only open tickets?
[09:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> 43 is only open, yeah.
[09:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> I figured that's a similar indicator to number of duplicates.
[09:07:57] <jzaefferer> This widget memory leak ticket is great: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4188 - created five years ago, 50 comments, no solution
[09:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've tried to track that down on several occassions with no luck.
[09:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually inclined to just close it as patcheswelcome
[09:10:54] <tj_vantoll> There's a known memory leak in datepicker that might be behind that as well.
[09:10:58] <tj_vantoll> Agreed on patcheswelcome.
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections?
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> Not hearing any objections, I'm going to close the ticket.
[09:12:43] <jzaefferer> yeah, seems sane
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> yay, one less ticket :-)
[09:15:01] <jzaefferer> SUCCESS \o/
[09:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to button.
[09:15:45] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: any inclination to check out those two autocomplete issues?
[09:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You finished your first round of review, correct?
[09:16:10] <jzaefferer> My second actually
[09:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[09:16:19] <arschmitz> i have a related issue for button id like to discuss with button
[09:16:27] <arschmitz> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9505
[09:17:02] <arschmitz> its about focus outline and im hoping someone will have a suggestion on this
[09:17:11] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: I can add them to my list, I should be able to take a look next week.
[09:17:25] <jzaefferer> cool, thanks
[09:18:08] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: whatever we do, the current focus behaviour is awful, since its impossible to tell that a radio group has focus
[09:18:15] <arschmitz> the problem is we use the label as the "button" but labels never get focus so no focus outline the only ways to fix this i can think of would be to no longer use the label use a div and implement all the area and handling ourselves rather then rely on native
[09:18:15] <jzaefferer> we need to fix that in the rewrite
[09:18:29] <arschmitz> or create our own focus outline
[09:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> So this is focus + active, right?
[09:19:10] <jzaefferer> Are you sure that's the problem?
[09:19:19] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: correct
[09:19:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, is the question about native focus outline?
[09:19:27] <arschmitz> yes
[09:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> We never do anything with outline.
[09:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> ever
[09:19:49] <jzaefferer> So we add ui-state-focus, but its not perceptible as the style gets overwritten by ui-state-active
[09:20:03] <jzaefferer> native radios use different styling for active and focused
[09:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> A focused radio is always active.
[09:20:59] <jzaefferer> Most of our widgets remove the outline and replace it with something custom to indicate the widget has focus. Radio groups don't do that
[09:21:12] <jzaefferer> Yeah, but an active radio isn't necessarily focused
[09:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> If by most you mean menu.
[09:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> And that's only on the menu itself, just like dialog.
[09:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> We only touch outline for wrappers and resets.
[09:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> We never touch outline on an actual element that you would interact with.
[09:23:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: right which is what happens right now
[09:23:04] <jzaefferer> Well, not-active checkboxes have a focus style, active checkboxes have the same problem as radio buttons
[09:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but they don't get an outline in any case.
[09:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> Because we don't add outlines.
[09:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> We can add outline to ui-state-focus if we want.
[09:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure it'll piss people off.
[09:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> But it also pissed people off when we stopped removing outlines.
[09:24:41] <arschmitz> we dont mess with focus outline in mobile either
[09:25:08] <arschmitz> if possible we make the native one show but its not always possible like in this case
[09:25:32] <arschmitz> it also gets super weird when you get into controlgroups
[09:25:42] <arschmitz> you get them on like only certain sides
[09:28:07] <arschmitz> interesting but unrelated note on checkbox accessibility i cannot find a single example of a css3 checkbox that is keyboard accessible and most are also not accessible to screen readers
[09:29:46] <scott_gonzalez> I can't seem to get Chrome to render an outline on these buttons.
[09:30:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: in the re-write you mean?
[09:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I had to use a WebKit specific setting.
[09:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> outline: -webkit-focus-ring-color auto 5px;
[09:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> In the current implementation.
[09:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> I was trying to modify .ui-state-focus
[09:30:56] <arschmitz> ok
[09:31:18] <arschmitz> yeah there is no single way to do the outline like that i dont think
[09:31:39] <arschmitz> im not even sure what you can do in ie8 would have to ask someone else
[09:32:26] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'm almost positive WebKit is the only rendering engine that lets you reapply the native focus.
[09:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> IE8 supports it.
[09:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> By supports it, I meant setting the outline styles, not using the native color.
[09:34:05] <arschmitz> right so we would have to add a ui outline style rather then use native
[09:34:09] <tj_vantoll> ah, yeah
[09:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> Let's ping Chris Coyier about it.
[09:35:45] <arschmitz> ok
[09:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for button?
[09:37:42] <arschmitz> no
[09:38:19] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: update on Globalize?
[09:38:30] <rxaviers> Docs improvement PR has been landed
[09:39:00] <rxaviers> Other than that, I had a question on regard of automating tests
[09:39:05] <rxaviers> #235
[09:39:37] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/235#issuecomment-41172796
[09:40:25] <arschmitz> oh if we have time i thought of one other button thing but it can wait till next week if we run short
[09:40:27] <rxaviers> Trying to run the config of my comment, gives me
[09:40:27] <rxaviers> Error getting browsers list from BrowserStack
[09:40:27] <rxaviers> [Error: HTTP Basic: Access denied.
[09:40:27] <rxaviers> ]
[09:40:49] <rxaviers> perhaps it has to do with the user and key Im using
[09:40:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: we can discuss that later
[09:41:04] <jzaefferer> I'll comment on the ticket or ping you in #jqueryui-dev
[09:41:06] <rxaviers> where do you get the key from? I picked mine at the automate tab on browserstack site
[09:41:11] <rxaviers> excellent
[09:41:12] <rxaviers> sure
[09:41:58] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: would this API still be okay to create a local-specific instance? https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/234#issuecomment-40619108
[09:42:07] <rxaviers> I think so
[09:42:25] <rxaviers> I think it's a good one, and I can implement that
[09:42:45] <jzaefferer> Okay, let's do that then
[09:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> On the selectmenu?
[09:45:51] <fnagel> I've added a new demo, see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1230
[09:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> The demo looks good. We just need a name.
[09:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have suggestions?
[09:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we could just pick a round product, like a medicine ball or a yoga ball.
[09:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe not a yoga ball, those don't have different sizes, do they?
[09:48:00] <tj_vantoll> Product Selection?
[09:48:00] <fnagel> Why not product?
[09:48:08] <fnagel> or attribute-selection
[09:48:10] <arschmitz> frisbee
[09:49:03] <tj_vantoll> I like the generic names unless we can come up with some means of making the thing look like a ball/frisbee/etc.
[09:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> Product Selection sounds good.
[09:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's generic about what it is you're selecting.
[09:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> But puts the user in a mindset where they would be applying it to their own real world usage.
[09:51:24] <tj_vantoll> :thumbs up:
[09:51:56] <fnagel> ok, I will push the needed changes in a few minutes
[09:52:16] <fnagel> I was working on Hans comments regarding a11y but without real progress.
[09:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure why this is so tricky.
[09:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> It should be pretty easy.
[09:54:34] <fnagel> *should*
[09:54:50] <arschmitz> since when did this stuff get easy?
[09:55:31] <tj_vantoll> :)
[09:56:02] <fnagel> I will give it another try and we'll see
[09:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: re: never easy: https://twitter.com/scott_gonzalez/status/456588974492889088
[09:56:40] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @scott_gonzalez: ARIA is such a mess. Nothing sane ever works. Everything ends up with tons of hacks. Year after year of disappointment :-/
[09:56:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yes i followed that thread
[09:56:59] <arschmitz> its sad
[09:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> I still need to put together the list for WCAG.
[09:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's on my list for today.
[09:57:52] <arschmitz> but in all seriousness this should not be that complicated its a select menu
[09:58:17] <arschmitz> but it is beyond complicated which is crazy
[09:59:55] <fnagel> I need to retweet this :-D
[10:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> I did a pass through all the tests. Docs are next on my list for selectmenu.
[10:02:26] <jzaefferer> I'm going to go through all our demos in a few browsers to check for regressions before 1.11
[10:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess that leads right into our next item, which is the release.
[10:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> What do you think about doing a beta this week?
[10:03:15] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: if there is anything you want me to run through on devices let me know
[10:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be gone all next week (actually starting on Friday)
[10:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> So by this week I mean tomorrow.
[10:03:52] <tj_vantoll> +1 beta
[10:04:08] <kborchers> +1
[10:04:14] <tj_vantoll> fyi we do have one regression in 1.10.4 that came in yesterday: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9990
[10:05:23] <jzaefferer> beta tomorrow sounds good
[10:07:26] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: I'm curious if the rewrite (or jQuery Mobile) does anything to handle for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9990, but I'm guessing they don't.
[10:08:48] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: ill look at it
[10:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything to discuss for DB before we end?
[10:09:58] <rxaviers> Not today. Probably for the next one I will have.
[10:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
