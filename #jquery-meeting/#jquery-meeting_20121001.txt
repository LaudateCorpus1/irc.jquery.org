[08:50:13] <DaveMethvin> .
[08:50:23] <DaveMethvin> ok, who left the door open and the lights on?
[08:50:34] <DaveMethvin> ew, these donuts are stale!
[09:02:07] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:02:07] <DaveMethvin> yay jaubourg
[09:02:31] <DaveMethvin> so i hope i didn't push you into the w3c xhr thing
[09:02:37] <jaubourg> Just got a mail from Yehuda... I needed to ask for affiliation first apparently... silly silly me
[09:02:46] <jaubourg> oh no, this is cool
[09:03:02] <DaveMethvin> i figured it would be fun for you to fix the problems from the inside
[09:03:28] <jaubourg> provided I'll be able to fix it
[09:03:36] <DaveMethvin> oh you must!
[09:03:37] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:03:47] <jaubourg> time to learn the intricaties of standard politics
[09:03:50] <jaubourg> ;)
[09:04:04] <rwaldron> helllllo
[09:04:04] <b-ot> rwaldron, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[09:04:06] <DaveMethvin> that's where the french diplomacy comes in
[09:04:09] <rwaldron> bot read
[09:04:16] <rwaldron> b-ot: read
[09:04:16] <b-ot> rwaldron, from snover, 14h 35m ago: spammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm :P
[09:04:20] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:04:27] <rwaldron> stupid Waze.
[09:04:32] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: you mean a simple "Je vous emmerde" will do the trick? :P
[09:04:39] <jaubourg> lol
[09:04:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah nice diplomacy there
[09:04:55] <rwaldron> jaubourg dude, you need to be the editor of XHR
[09:05:00] <jaubourg> you said FRENCH diplomacy
[09:05:03] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:05:20] <rwaldron> I missed that email because i have it auto-moved-so-don't-see-this-shit
[09:05:26] <rwaldron> for anything on that list
[09:05:32] <DaveMethvin> as soon as i saw it i thought of jaubourg
[09:05:46] <rwaldron> yeah, I went digging after I saw the email this morning
[09:05:55] <rwaldron> and immediately thought "yes!"
[09:06:00] <DaveMethvin> i thought of how xhr has pained us and then plotted my revenge
[09:06:07] <jaubourg> haha
[09:06:41] <jaubourg> <DaveMethvin from his evil James Bond-like Villain Lair> Bwahahahaahahaha
[09:06:58] <DaveMethvin> ONE MILLLLLION UNIT TESTS
[09:07:21] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno if the others are showing today
[09:07:28] <DaveMethvin> just three of us?
[09:07:59] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking we might want to do a 1.8.3 next week
[09:08:05] <jaubourg> meh, let's refuse all their fixes
[09:08:08] <jaubourg> that'll teach them
[09:08:11] <DaveMethvin> just to clean up some of the bugs hanging out
[09:08:30] <jaubourg> we have new blockers?
[09:08:41] <DaveMethvin> it's not critical but might keep a few reports off our backs while we work on 1.9/2.0
[09:08:47] <DaveMethvin> nothing really serious
[09:08:55] <DaveMethvin> just the usual regressions :P
[09:08:56] <jaubourg> k
[09:09:13] <jaubourg> heh
[09:09:42] <DaveMethvin> so jaubourg i saw you had ajaxhooks there, did you want to try and work on that during the summit?
[09:09:43] <jaubourg> saw this regression in ajax
[09:10:04] <jaubourg> yeah, I'd love to but I dunno who'd be interested
[09:10:21] <DaveMethvin> people who love ajax!
[09:10:24] <jaubourg> what I'd like to do is bring the project under jQuery proper
[09:10:39] <rwaldron> Now that's proper.
[09:10:44] <jaubourg> oh, you mean me and my gf... no srap the gf she hates the late nights I pass on this :P
[09:11:07] <DaveMethvin> let her know the communication of the free world depends on it
[09:11:21] <rwaldron> it's true.
[09:11:33] <DaveMethvin> damn right, literally
[09:11:34] <jaubourg> omg I just had a when eagles attack image flashing in front of my eyes
[09:11:43] <DaveMethvin> haah
[09:12:02] <DaveMethvin> one other idea i had was to rip out the deprecated stuff during the summit
[09:12:07] <DaveMethvin> and move it to the compat plugin
[09:12:10] <DaveMethvin> i've started that locally
[09:12:21] <DaveMethvin> but realized it could serve multiple purposes
[09:12:21] <jaubourg> so anyway, the plan would be to document the thing, add custom build support (a-la UI)
[09:12:34] <rwaldron> Did everyone enjoy my meeting notes?
[09:12:44] <rwaldron> I'm sure you all read through them, every single word
[09:12:50] <DaveMethvin> yes rwaldron i ment to give you an attaboy on that
[09:12:56] <jaubourg> everything I think about for ajaxHooks would probably be better served if it was a jQuery owned project since we could share stuff
[09:12:58] <DaveMethvin> and yes I DID read them totally
[09:13:10] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: love the := operator
[09:13:13] <jaubourg> didn't read them yet but what I saw was really nice
[09:13:15] <DaveMethvin> want it now
[09:13:24] <jaubourg> and COMPACT
[09:13:24] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin we're deferring on that for now
[09:13:30] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: that includes the xdomainrequest stuff for ie9 too?
[09:13:36] <jaubourg> yep
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> one less thing for people to bitch about
[09:13:47] <rwaldron> because it was introduced too late and there isn't much Object.defineProperties use in the world yet
[09:13:53] <jaubourg> + whenArray, $.Topic, $.whenever, etc etc
[09:13:58] <rwaldron> not enough to spend the syntax on it
[09:13:59] <DaveMethvin> chicken. egg.
[09:14:08] <timmywil> hi
[09:14:08] <bot-t> (75 hours 50 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell timmywil: Bower docs are severely lacking and I have absolutely no desire to create additional work for myself to support any dependency tools other than the jQuery Plugins site.
[09:14:08] <rwaldron> right
[09:14:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah so there timmywil
[09:14:19] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:14:25] <jaubourg> hey timmu
[09:14:26] <jaubourg> y
[09:14:29] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:14:38] <rwaldron> I also had to give up Object.define() which was batch define that used the source descriptor maps
[09:14:44] <rwaldron> for the same reason
[09:14:45] <DaveMethvin> just riffing here on possible things to do for the summit timmywil
[09:14:52] <timmywil> gotcha
[09:15:19] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: having official support for those ajaxhooks seems to make sense
[09:15:21] <rwaldron> but Object.assign( target, source ) is the intersection of extend, merge, mixin etc. but with the correct name for the operation
[09:15:27] <rwaldron> anyway, that's fun
[09:15:27] <timmywil> +1 for github.com/jQuery/ajaxHooks
[09:15:35] <rwaldron> also real private stuff
[09:15:39] <rwaldron> which is MEGA
[09:16:02] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: the lib is really a nice-to-have but not-in-core collection of ajax/Deferred/async helpers
[09:16:02] <rwaldron> aaaand Object.observe is coming soon to a Chrome and Firefox near you
[09:16:09] <jaubourg> would make a lot of sense to me
[09:16:11] <rwaldron> with +1 from the MS Chakra team
[09:16:50] <rwaldron> jaubourg +9001 on that submodules task
[09:17:02] <DaveMethvin> yes, finally ditch the makefile
[09:17:07] <jaubourg> :)
[09:17:26] <rwaldron> jaubourg what do you think about making that a stand alone npm task
[09:17:40] <rwaldron> the way we did with the compare size stuff between UI and core
[09:17:49] <rwaldron> so we dont have two sets of the same code
[09:17:54] <DaveMethvin> is it general enough?
[09:17:56] <rwaldron> just use your package
[09:17:58] <jaubourg> could work but isn't it a bit small for that?
[09:18:00] <rwaldron> looks it
[09:18:01] <jaubourg> and general enough?
[09:18:08] <rwaldron> jaubourg naw it's perfect
[09:18:11] <DaveMethvin> can we have project-wide grunt tasks?
[09:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm -1 on making ajaxHooks official.
[09:18:35] <rwaldron> it looks general enough to me
[09:18:39] <jaubourg> k, I'll look into making this a grunt task... never did that
[09:18:39] <rwaldron> it just updates submodules
[09:19:00] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: what are the concerns?
[09:19:03] <DaveMethvin> is there something between a single project gruntfile task and an npm task?
[09:19:07] <rwaldron> jaubourg: use as example: https://github.com/rwldrn/grunt-compare-size
[09:19:16] <jaubourg> rwaldron: thanks
[09:19:24] <rwaldron> :)
[09:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's large and kind of all over the place.
[09:19:49] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin npm install my-task
[09:19:56] <rwaldron> then add: task.loadNpmTasks('my-task');
[09:20:03] <rwaldron> to your gruntfile
[09:20:08] <rwaldron> dunzo
[09:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> Also, i think it'd be bad for us to provide two official promise implementations.
[09:20:17] <DaveMethvin> right but where does the my-task come from?
[09:20:57] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: it's 2k min/gzipped and yes, it's a toolbox... hence why I'd like a custom build system for it... nearly nothing in ajaxHooks would justify an independant repo
[09:21:32] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: it's not another imp, it's just a means to interoperate by getting a promise/A compliant object
[09:21:39] <DaveMethvin> at least some of that is commonly requested, like XDR for IE, so having that in an official repo would be good
[09:22:15] <DaveMethvin> and we do get "questions" about our promise interoperation
[09:22:17] <jaubourg> ajaxHooks may be a terrible name though
[09:22:37] <DaveMethvin> your lack of naming skills is legend, jaubourg :D
[09:22:44] <jaubourg> indeed
[09:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> I absoutely do not think we should ever provide an implementation like this: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/img.js
[09:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think this is one of the worst things we've ever done.
[09:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> $.ajax() is a mess, let's not showcase how messy it is.
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> you don't like the image transport? :D  on that one i agree
[09:23:22] <jaubourg> I don't like it either
[09:23:26] <DaveMethvin> it's more of a demo
[09:23:32] <jaubourg> exactly
[09:23:39] <jaubourg> it's more of a tutorial kind of thing
[09:23:50] <jaubourg> I know I did it for the ajax talk back in the days
[09:23:57] <DaveMethvin> how about this, let's review and see what might belong and whether it goes in one repo or several
[09:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> That still seems bad.
[09:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> Why are we talking about it?
[09:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> Let's not say "Hey! Look how you can twist this around!"
[09:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> Let's talk about things that are actually good.
[09:24:24] <DaveMethvin> for example the promise/a interoperabilty seems like it might be better done as its own plugin
[09:24:47] <DaveMethvin> oh, and the other way to do this would be to have these be some of the seed plugins in the new plugin site
[09:25:05] <DaveMethvin> to demonstrate how to set them up, that could be done at the summit
[09:25:36] <DaveMethvin> whether they are official or not they should be on the plugin site, right?
[09:25:46] <jaubourg> I don't really care about the form it takes, I'd just like those helpers to be brought to the public in a comprehensive fashion. Now, I welcome code review and filtering, as usual
[09:26:29] <jaubourg> xdr has been requested, promise/a interoperability has been requested, whenArray has been requested, whenever has been requested, etc
[09:26:42] <DaveMethvin> yes, agreed
[09:26:46] <jaubourg> css transport has been requested often too
[09:26:46] <DaveMethvin> sometimes several times
[09:26:52] <DaveMethvin> really?
[09:26:56] <jaubourg> yep
[09:27:52] <DaveMethvin> okay, on to mundane things
[09:28:47] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12630
[09:29:12] <DaveMethvin> there are just a few bugs we may want to fix and do a 1.8.3
[09:29:22] <DaveMethvin> i landed a few last night
[09:29:44] <DaveMethvin> and there's #12630 and the ajax url one i am too lazy to find
[09:31:10] <jaubourg> ?#12635
[09:31:12] <bot-t> [#12635] jquery 1.8.2 fails ajax calls in IE9 because it assumes cross domain when default port is in ajax url (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/12635
[09:31:17] <jaubourg> ic
[09:31:19] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:31:27] <jaubourg> =)
[09:31:32] <DaveMethvin> i have a couple of trac-related issues that i suspect only gnarf can help me with
[09:31:42] <DaveMethvin> mentioned in the agenda
[09:33:09] <jaubourg> damn, can't find the doc in drive
[09:33:22] <jaubourg> how I miss the google docs UI
[09:33:25] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:33:38] <jaubourg> thanks :)
[09:33:46] <DaveMethvin> sometimes i edit stuff just to keep it at the top of the heap
[09:34:37] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:35:47] <DaveMethvin> was just looking for other tix
[09:36:16] <DaveMethvin> anyway, be sure to vote on the 1.9 tickets if you care about them
[09:36:34] <timmywil> right, I need to do that
[09:36:42] <jaubourg> k, still need to answer to this beforeSend global event ticket
[09:36:54] <jaubourg> I hate how time pass sometimes
[09:36:54] <DaveMethvin> oh right, that was on the list
[09:38:26] <DaveMethvin> atm we don't have a 1.8.3 milestone so i've closed a few as 1.9
[09:38:40] <DaveMethvin> so if we do a release i'll go back and flip those to 1.8.3
[09:39:10] <jaubourg> you want to do a 1.8.3 before the summit?
[09:39:23] <jaubourg> wouldn't it make sense to do it while the summit?
[09:39:35] <jaubourg> omg grammar
[09:39:37] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking we could do the dissection at the summit
[09:39:45] <DaveMethvin> remove the 1.9 deprecated stuff
[09:39:53] <DaveMethvin> but have a 1.8.3 out next week perhaps
[09:40:00] <DaveMethvin> with the fixes we're landing now
[09:40:27] <DaveMethvin> not really critical but if there are enough accumulated it might be worthwhile
[09:40:28] <jaubourg> k, I'll work on this ajax cache bug then
[09:40:51] <jaubourg> we need a 1.8.3 tag
[09:40:54] <DaveMethvin> alright, that's about it for me
[09:41:06] <DaveMethvin> i'll create one
[09:41:30] <DaveMethvin> boom
[09:41:39] <jaubourg> same here... regarding ajaxHooks, we can talk about it at the summit with everyone face to face, no urgency
[09:42:10] <jaubourg> I'm just looking at the best possible way to provide all these async goodies people want
[09:42:40] <DaveMethvin> having a plugin site should help visibility on this stuff
[09:42:44] <jaubourg> gotta fly right now
[09:42:47] <DaveMethvin> it's been a problem for a while
[09:42:49] <DaveMethvin> thanks jaubourg
[09:43:01] <jaubourg> cya guys :)
