[10:01:22] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting time!
[10:01:55] <sfrisk> ping geekman-rohit_, kristyjy, arschmitz, arthurvr
[10:02:20] <geekman-rohit> hey
[10:02:49] <kristyjy> hi
[10:03:13] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:03:16] <sfrisk> Agenda
[10:05:09] <sfrisk> Add your name to the attending list
[10:05:13] <sfrisk> please, and thank you
[10:05:19] <geekman-rohit> um thats last weeks?
[10:05:24] <sfrisk> nope
[10:05:35] <sfrisk> it's subtly different
[10:06:02] <sfrisk> but there weren't many people here last time so we ended up not really discussing what a lot of the topics
[10:06:29] <geekman-rohit> ya
[10:06:50] <sfrisk> Is arschmitz around?
[10:07:03] <arschmitz> here
[10:07:07] <sfrisk> ah, hey!
[10:07:49] <sfrisk> Okay, so starting out with the Performance related PRs
[10:08:19] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit submitted a PR for localized downloads, which is part of the work that needed to be done for performance, that was discussed last week
[10:08:28] <geekman-rohit> I'll need to update it though
[10:08:39] <geekman-rohit> as arschmitz suggested we will be using bower / bowercopy
[10:09:44] <geekman-rohit> I should be able to update soon, though bower.json needs some project related details?
[10:10:08] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz we will maintain the file in repo ?
[10:10:23] <arschmitz> i would think
[10:10:54] <arschmitz> just list the development dependencies
[10:11:17] <arschmitz> that we use directly through it
[10:11:21] <arschmitz> like bootstrap
[10:11:30] <geekman-rohit> yes with fixed versions, ill use current latest's ?
[10:11:49] <geekman-rohit> or the ones included in the framewok js files?
[10:12:08] <arschmitz> minor bumps are fine
[10:12:28] <arschmitz> major bumps you would need to make sure nothing changes in the markup or classnames
[10:12:30] <arschmitz> etc
[10:12:44] <geekman-rohit> I will ping if I see a need to do major bump
[10:12:47] <geekman-rohit> I doubt it though
[10:13:08] <geekman-rohit> I tried doing i last night after ur comment, seemed good to me :+1
[10:13:39] <arschmitz> its like curl but with a package manager lol
[10:13:47] <geekman-rohit> would be cool if someone could run grunt perf on out current master? I seem to be getting problems
[10:13:52] <arschmitz> your just manually copying the files we need
[10:14:08] <geekman-rohit> yes. I didnt know bowercopy existed lol
[10:14:10] <arschmitz> do you have your couchdb running
[10:14:14] <geekman-rohit> yes
[10:14:23] <arschmitz> i always forget to start it
[10:14:29] <geekman-rohit> I get error on selenium server
[10:15:05] <arschmitz> ok ill have to try it
[10:15:53] <geekman-rohit> Error response status: 13, UnknownError - An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Selenium error: unknown error: unhandled inspector error: {"code":-32000,"message":"Timeline is deprecated. Please use Tracing instead"}
[10:19:13] <sfrisk> I can try it too
[10:20:38] <geekman-rohit> thanks
[10:21:43] <sfrisk> Okay, so moving on
[10:21:51] <sfrisk> to Build Related PRs
[10:22:17] <sfrisk> arthurvr's issue is good to go, I just didn't get to merging it in last week, since life was a wee bit crazy
[10:23:07] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit's PR (because he's been on the PR roll lately) on linting should be good to go
[10:23:52] <geekman-rohit> yeah it looks good to merge
[10:23:54] <sfrisk> If no one else has any issues with it, I'll pull it in tonight
[10:28:19] <sfrisk> Okay, next up is Build: heirarchial prefixer for scss variables
[10:28:28] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, do you want to talk about this a bit?
[10:28:35] <geekman-rohit> that should wait
[10:29:00] <geekman-rohit> we should see in a few weeks if that is useful in declaring variables in jsass-vars
[10:29:20] <geekman-rohit> thats basically for sfrisk to decide since she would be doing most of scss coding
[10:29:24] <sfrisk> true
[10:29:54] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, if you think it will help you , we could pull it in. Or if I end up doing  one more PR for a component and use that
[10:29:56] <sfrisk> I need to pull is jsass into buttons tonight - which is a nice pile of variables to test with
[10:29:57] <geekman-rohit> then we should
[10:30:07] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[10:30:21] <geekman-rohit> It's a small function, could be useful , depends on our preference
[10:30:55] <sfrisk> definitely worth looking into
[10:31:05] <sfrisk> although your structure could also help with the themeroller
[10:31:10] <geekman-rohit> it also makes.. copy pating variables easy
[10:31:13] <geekman-rohit> lol
[10:31:28] <sfrisk> and how to lay out editing fields
[10:31:32] <geekman-rohit> it gives us an inherent structure yep
[10:31:55] <geekman-rohit> that was the idea behind, and also i was just too lazy to type so many variables for my meter PR
[10:32:15] <sfrisk> so part of me is inclined to leaning towards your idea - and it could help with the more complicated css variables that require more than just an integer input
[10:32:35] <geekman-rohit> and its the developers choice, he could choose not to use it
[10:32:57] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: well if we are going it have it we should always use it
[10:33:03] <arschmitz> we should be consistent
[10:33:09] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[10:33:18] <sfrisk> consistency is important
[10:33:30] <sfrisk> helps make it easier for other people to work on this project, if there is a clear guide
[10:33:37] <geekman-rohit> if we decide not to use it I'll have to update my meter pr accordingly
[10:33:38] <sfrisk> on what our best practices are
[10:33:58] <geekman-rohit> the only concern it faces is that the names of the variables are not directly mentioned in the js file
[10:34:41] <arschmitz> it does obfuscate things quite a bit
[10:35:00] <arschmitz> it makes it easier to type but much harder for someone else to understand
[10:35:18] <geekman-rohit> kindof, ya
[10:35:36] <geekman-rohit> but then anyone new to jsass vars will take a few minutes to get used to it
[10:35:43] <geekman-rohit> any new developer
[10:36:06] <arschmitz> yes but if you look at the file its pretty obvious because the names are 1:1
[10:36:19] <arschmitz> for what you use in other files
[10:36:28] <geekman-rohit> true
[10:36:30] <sfrisk> If needed, we could always include some sort of guide about it
[10:36:53] <arschmitz> im fine either way im just pointing out that is a downfall of the approach
[10:36:59] <sfrisk> include it into a style guide or something
[10:37:03] <geekman-rohit> Or have a description of it in a comment
[10:37:20] <sfrisk> yup
[10:37:37] <geekman-rohit> I think if sfrisk decides to use it in her buttons PR
[10:37:43] <geekman-rohit> we could pull it in
[10:37:50] <arschmitz> if you include the normal name as a comment doesnt that then defeate the point of the compiler?
[10:38:19] <sfrisk> I think geekman-rohit meant a description of how it works?
[10:38:29] <geekman-rohit> yeah,
[10:38:35] <geekman-rohit> what sfrisk said
[10:38:39] <arschmitz> ok
[10:40:45] <sfrisk> okay, next up is Build: add accessibility testing
[10:41:12] <sfrisk> Looks like arschmitz and dylanb were going to work  on some aspects of it together?
[10:41:30] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:41:35] <sfrisk> browserstack
[10:41:42] <arschmitz> yup
[10:42:14] <sfrisk> any traction on that at all?
[10:42:15] <arschmitz> not much progress yet
[10:42:18] <sfrisk> okay
[10:42:18] <geekman-rohit> on that point we need to decide colors for buttons/ progressbars etc.
[10:42:26] <arschmitz> they are changing the repo name
[10:42:32] <arschmitz> to conform with standards
[10:42:57] <sfrisk> Yeah, Iwas going to discuss that in the css/scss related prs
[10:43:14] <sfrisk> I was thinking for testing purposes, I might just use the colors that github uses for their buttons
[10:43:30] <sfrisk> and if we want to tweak it later for a more chassis branding we can do that
[10:43:37] <sfrisk> but later, so colors don't hold us up
[10:43:54] <arschmitz> im fine with whatever
[10:44:06] <geekman-rohit> also the colors gray and gray dark
[10:44:07] <arschmitz> i dont consider colors a breaking change or anything
[10:44:15] <geekman-rohit> in typography are not actually scss variables
[10:44:57] <sfrisk> I can open up a PR to fix typography to align with what we're doing right now for variables
[10:44:58] <geekman-rohit> I was thinking we should have them so we can have common shade of gray borders
[10:46:02] <geekman-rohit> cool
[10:46:26] <geekman-rohit> i think we should merge button first so we can add things to scss style guide
[10:46:32] <geekman-rohit> and adapt older things to it then
[10:46:38] <geekman-rohit> button or meter.  either
[10:47:08] <sfrisk> only reason I suggested opening up a PR for typography is it would be relatively easy to fix that
[10:47:20] <sfrisk> vs buttons which I still have a bunch more button cases to take care of
[10:48:09] <geekman-rohit> true that,
[10:48:34] <geekman-rohit> lol I just what I would be easier for me if I did that PR is all
[10:49:29] <sfrisk> also if typography is fixed, we have an example in the codebase of how we want things to be done
[10:49:54] <geekman-rohit> umm ya
[10:51:08] <sfrisk> Okay, next up - Typography: add breakpoint variables and use them
[10:51:40] <geekman-rohit> yeah so there
[10:51:52] <geekman-rohit> calling them breakpoints is also a bad idea it seems
[10:52:00] <geekman-rohit> we need something like viewport-sm-min
[10:52:23] <geekman-rohit> I was hoping we could reach a decision on that today
[10:53:25] <geekman-rohit> viewport-xs-min(0) viewport-sm-min(400) .. viewport-md-min viewport-lg-min viewport-lg-max
[10:53:28] <geekman-rohit> is what i propose
[10:55:24] <sfrisk> (sorry, refreshing myself on the conversation on github)
[10:56:27] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/106#issuecomment-129992977
[10:56:45] <sfrisk> so cvrebert's suggestion?
[10:57:15] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[10:57:35] <geekman-rohit> unless we want to have viewport-xl-min instead of viewport-lg-max
[10:57:45] <geekman-rohit> which makes more sense now that I think
[10:59:03] <sfrisk> viewport-lg-max probably won't be used - since that's really "anything above the large viewport"
[10:59:26] <geekman-rohit> yep but if someone is targeting large hd displays?
[10:59:33] <geekman-rohit> they are 1920px wide
[10:59:57] <sfrisk> I'm trying to remember what numbers we came up with
[11:00:16] <sfrisk> 400, 768, 920, 1200
[11:00:20] <kristyjy> 400,768,920,1200
[11:00:21] <kristyjy> lol
[11:00:22] <sfrisk> 1200 would be the min size of large
[11:00:23] <geekman-rohit> yep
[11:00:29] <kristyjy> I was too late
[11:00:33] <geekman-rohit> no
[11:00:45] <geekman-rohit> 1200 will be minimum size on extra large now
[11:00:50] <geekman-rohit> since xs starts from 0
[11:00:57] <geekman-rohit> as cvrebert and arschmitz suggested
[11:01:01] <geekman-rohit> and they do make a point
[11:01:23] <sfrisk> looking for the xl discussion
[11:01:54] <sfrisk> xs: 0 - 400
[11:01:56] <geekman-rohit> so xs is 0 to 480, sm is 480 to 768 , md is 768 to 920, lg is 920 to 1200 and xl is anything beyond 1200
[11:02:05] <geekman-rohit> 400**
[11:02:26] <sfrisk> you'll want small to start at 401
[11:02:47] <geekman-rohit> that too, small starts at 401? or 400?
[11:02:51] <sfrisk> if the xs and sm both cover 400px, it could get funky
[11:03:01] <geekman-rohit> xs ends at 399 or 400?
[11:03:25] <sfrisk> xs would end with 400
[11:03:41] <sfrisk> although to be fair, xs is the default viewport
[11:03:51] <geekman-rohit> so sm starts at 401, same goes for the rest?
[11:04:22] <sfrisk> so in most cases we would never use the xs -min -max variables
[11:04:26] <sfrisk> since we're going mobile first
[11:04:31] <geekman-rohit> we have 5 viewports here, do we need these many?
[11:04:46] <sfrisk> most styling would start at the sm-min size
[11:04:53] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[11:06:21] <sfrisk> or we could call it xs-max
[11:06:29] <sfrisk> so the small media query would be from:
[11:06:35] <sfrisk> xs-max - sm-max
[11:06:38] <geekman-rohit> we should declare maxs as well
[11:06:51] <sfrisk> and we wouldn't need to declare the min value
[11:07:09] <geekman-rohit> we could have all 9 variables
[11:07:23] <geekman-rohit> but encourage using only min ones
[11:07:40] <sfrisk> xs-max, sm-min, sm-max, md-min, md-max, lg-min, lg-max, xl-min ?
[11:07:49] <geekman-rohit> yep
[11:08:03] <sfrisk> I think in the case of xs-max/sm-min in might be a bit reduntant
[11:08:15] <geekman-rohit> we simply declare them as xs-max+!
[11:08:19] <geekman-rohit> sx-max+1
[11:08:57] <geekman-rohit> but true, they will be redundant, so what do we declare.. the max variables or the min ones.
[11:08:58] <geekman-rohit> ?
[11:09:42] <sfrisk> so we have (min-width: $breakpoint-sx-max + 1) and (
[11:09:56] <sfrisk> (max-width: $breakpoint-sm-max)
[11:10:11] <geekman-rohit> um
[11:10:17] <sfrisk> @meida only screen (min-width: $breakpoint-sx-max + 1) and (max-width: $breakpoint-sm-max) {}
[11:10:23] <geekman-rohit> we dont need to use both min and max
[11:10:25] <sfrisk> @media*
[11:10:30] <geekman-rohit> we will be cascading the styles
[11:10:52] <geekman-rohit> so we use only @media(min-width: sm-min)
[11:11:33] <sfrisk> if you use sm-min though, that basically means we will never use xs-min
[11:11:37] <geekman-rohit> and $viewport-sm-min going by this thinking, once we add min it becomes clear
[11:11:52] <sfrisk> and it becomes a useless variable
[11:11:54] <geekman-rohit> yep xs- min will be implicit
[11:12:47] <geekman-rohit> xs will be implicit, we can add that in guide
[11:13:00] <geekman-rohit> we will never use any media queries for xs anyways
[11:13:29] <sfrisk> then what's the point of having that variable?
[11:13:36] <sfrisk> http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-media-queries
[11:14:12] <sfrisk> that is what I believe cverbert was suggesting
[11:14:40] <geekman-rohit> cvrebert was ponting out that we dont have any thing below 400
[11:14:47] <geekman-rohit> since we have xs named at 400
[11:14:58] <geekman-rohit> if we have sm at 400 its assumed anything below is cs
[11:15:00] <geekman-rohit> xs*
[11:15:17] <geekman-rohit> he did mention xs will be implicit
[11:15:32] <geekman-rohit> but we should start thinking xs as 0-400
[11:15:38] <sfrisk> it's more it might be useful to have a xs-max variable
[11:15:40] <geekman-rohit> and sm as 401-
[11:16:08] <geekman-rohit> lets see what others say, I left a comment
[11:16:19] <sfrisk> sm-min = 401 sm-max = 768
[11:17:02] <sfrisk> md-min = 769  mid-max = 920
[11:17:41] <sfrisk> lg-min = 921 lg-max = 1200px ?
[11:18:02] <sfrisk> xl-min 1201 xl-max - ????? (if any)
[11:18:10] <geekman-rohit> thats the idea yeah
[11:18:17] <geekman-rohit> xl-max : infinity
[11:18:50] <geekman-rohit> i think arschmitz was thinking this all along, hence his suggestion of sayign viewport
[11:19:26] <sfrisk> okay, well update your comment to show the min-max values of each range
[11:19:27] <arschmitz> more or less
[11:20:15] <sfrisk> rather than just the min variable values
[11:20:58] <arschmitz> wait why sm min 401
[11:21:03] <arschmitz> shouldnt min be 0
[11:21:13] <sfrisk> xs-min is 0
[11:21:22] <sfrisk> sx-max is 400
[11:21:25] <sfrisk> sm-min is 401
[11:22:55] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz : https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/106#issuecomment-129992977
[11:23:04] <sfrisk> okay, it's 2:22, I kinda need to be getting back to work
[11:23:35] <geekman-rohit> and me to bower :D
[11:24:04] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: i think you have an error
[11:24:10] <arschmitz> sm 401-268
[11:24:22] <sfrisk> I tweaked it
[11:24:30] <geekman-rohit> ah :D
[11:24:35] <sfrisk> it says 768 now
[11:24:49] <geekman-rohit> how can you edit my comment?
[11:25:21] <sfrisk> admin, sorry I should have let you do it
[11:25:29] <geekman-rohit> nah totally cool
[11:25:35] <geekman-rohit> I just didnt know that was possible :D
[11:26:35] <sfrisk> Okay, on that note, back to work
[11:26:43] <sfrisk> see everyone in #css-chassing/the boards
