[14:01:28] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:01:37] <thej> Hey !
[14:01:41] <sfrisk> arschmitz, kristyjy, geekman-rohit
[14:01:47] <kristyjy> hello
[14:01:49] <arschmitz> hi
[14:01:55] <sfrisk> Finishing up the agenda
[14:01:56] <sfrisk> one moment
[14:01:57] <rawteech> Hello
[14:02:51] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:03:58] <sfrisk> first up, I would liked to get the JSASS Pr resolved
[14:04:22] <sfrisk> arschmitz, have you had a chance to look at the Travis issues?
[14:04:41] <sfrisk> (I say as I check the PR and it now works)
[14:04:57] <arschmitz> yeah i fixed that last week i think
[14:05:02] <sfrisk> yup
[14:05:08] <sfrisk> didn't get a notification via email I guess
[14:05:35] <sfrisk> okay, I'm going to pull that in after the meeting
[14:05:50] <sfrisk> which should solve any build issues people are having with running chassis in node 5+
[14:07:39] <sfrisk> kristyjy - how goes table stuff?
[14:07:45] <sfrisk> I know you started work on making in class based
[14:08:06] <kristyjy> yeah that's just been started
[14:08:19] <kristyjy> I haven't had a chance to finish it up but that's the goal for this week
[14:09:08] <rawteech> kristyjy, willing to give a helping hand in that if you dont mind
[14:11:08] <kristyjy> I have quite a bit done so maybe hold off for a few days? I should be able to update the PR before the weekend
[14:11:43] <kristyjy> then if you want to take a look from there it might make more sense
[14:12:01] <rawteech> ok, that would be great
[14:13:43] <sfrisk> okay, sounds good
[14:13:51] <sfrisk> next up is RTL: Added CSS Janus to build
[14:15:15] <sfrisk> we talked about this last week, although it doesn't look like there has been any more updates on this PR
[14:15:20] <thej> I am now maintaining a single CSS file that contains both RTL and LTR and applying rules as required.
[14:15:31] <thej> Will push the changes tonight.
[14:15:38] <sfrisk> ok
[14:17:55] <sfrisk> Next up is the images base styling https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/149
[14:21:01] <sfrisk> in the process of pulling it down so I can look at it
[14:21:20] <thej> Sure. Have added a demo page as well
[14:22:37] <thej> @sfrisk have a small query with regard to RTL support
[14:22:52] <sfrisk> sure
[14:23:30] <thej> I was wondering if instead of having a single CSS file, we could have only the flipped rules in the second CSS file.
[14:23:46] <thej> This file can be used to override if desired the original CSS
[14:24:23] <thej> If it's a single CSS file, aren't we bloating it up ?
[14:24:28] <sfrisk> I believe the reasoning behind not wanting to overwrite that was so it would technically be possible to have both RTL and LTR content on one page, correct  arschmitz?
[14:24:48] <arschmitz> yes
[14:25:04] <arschmitz> supporting just rtl or just ltr is not enough
[14:25:11] <arschmitz> you need to be able to mix them in the same page
[14:25:54] <thej> Ok. Multilingual content on the same page
[14:26:05] <arschmitz> yes
[14:26:06] <rawteech> Was also thinking the same way as thej, now I see the sense
[14:26:30] <thej> Ok. Sounds good.
[14:26:34] <rawteech> to be more flexible I guess
[14:26:59] <arschmitz> we have been working with experts from ibm egypt on this for jQuery UI
[14:27:06] <arschmitz> and they have been very clear on this fact
[14:27:18] <arschmitz> and there are many use cases for it
[14:27:24] <arschmitz> any thing with a feed
[14:27:30] <arschmitz> or user supplied content
[14:27:32] <arschmitz> editors
[14:27:40] <arschmitz> anything with examples
[14:27:49] <arschmitz> a translator app
[14:27:52] <arschmitz> goes on forever
[14:27:54] <thej> Oh wow. Is it on the issue tracker of jquery ui ?
[14:28:01] <arschmitz> yes
[14:28:06] <thej> Will have a look at the thread then.
[14:30:12] <sfrisk> Okay, I have looked over the image PR
[14:30:32] <sfrisk> It looks very similar to what bootstrap currently uses for their image styling
[14:32:40] <thej> Image shapes ?
[14:33:13] <sfrisk> The image shapes and how they do img-thumbnail
[14:34:07] <sfrisk> with the padding and the border
[14:34:42] <sfrisk> trying to figure out if that's the direction we want to go with images, or how we want to handle thumbnails in general
[14:35:44] <thej> I had a look at what Pure or Foundation does with images
[14:36:21] <thej> Should we follow a different approach to images ?
[14:37:18] <sfrisk> http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images-shapes
[14:37:35] <sfrisk> this is more me bringing it up for discussion - trying to figure out the best design direction
[14:37:59] <sfrisk> I agree rounded corner/circle/default images are a good idea
[14:38:52] <sfrisk> this is the sort of thing where style guide would be useful
[14:39:32] <thej> Ah yes.
[14:40:31] <rawteech> Jquery style guide?
[14:40:44] <thej> Maybe we can ask people for design opinions on the PR ? I will come up with alternates as well
[14:41:16] <sfrisk> more of a Chassis style guide - of how we would like components to look
[14:41:32] <sfrisk> so far we have a "These are the colors we're using for various states, and different acceptable shades of these colors)
[14:41:34] <sfrisk> "*
[14:41:38] <nashvail> a UI style guide certainly is required
[14:42:40] <rawteech> Yeah, we should have a pattern for Chassis
[14:42:43] <sfrisk> Agreed, since we want to have our components look like they all belong to the same "family" of components
[14:42:51] <sfrisk> and the thumbnail image made me think about it
[14:43:21] <rawteech> but I also think we should consider what people are used to working with
[14:43:44] <rawteech> the img-rounded, img-circle...
[14:44:09] <sfrisk> it's more super rounded corners for images might look odd against the rounded corners we have in buttons - which is a subtle rounded: http://view.css-chassis.com/master/demos/buttons.html
[14:44:17] <sfrisk> we still want things on a page to "match" each other
[14:44:34] <sfrisk> and seem like they came from the same family of components
[14:45:43] <thej> We should start working on the style guide in parallel as new components with design decisions are merged.
[14:46:04] <nashvail> I can take care of tha
[14:46:08] <nashvail> t
[14:47:10] <sfrisk> sounds good - we could just start with an issue that has notes on it
[14:47:15] <thej> That would help us to consistently follow some previously used guidelines and also as a log.
[14:47:28] <thej> Yeah.
[14:47:56] <rawteech> Sounds great!
[14:50:08] <nashvail> Also, this is my "Save your GPA" month so if I am little slow with the work, try to understand ðŸ˜„
[14:50:17] <sfrisk> ok
[14:50:57] <thej> I will start working on the style guide
[14:51:24] <thej> We all can contribute to it
[14:51:27] <sfrisk> work with nashvail then? nashvail also showed interest
[14:52:03] <thej> Yeah. Sure thing.
[14:52:03] <nashvail> yes
[14:52:39] <sfrisk> Okay, I need to get back to work
[14:52:54] <nashvail> oh! guess my PRs will be discussed next week then
[14:52:59] <sfrisk> yup
[14:53:03] <nashvail> no worries
[14:53:10] <sfrisk> I'll try to put some comments on them today though
[14:54:05] <nashvail> yeah I'll make sure they are resolved
[14:54:11] <sfrisk> I'll get that JSASS PR pulled in
[14:54:30] <sfrisk> see everyone next week/on github!
