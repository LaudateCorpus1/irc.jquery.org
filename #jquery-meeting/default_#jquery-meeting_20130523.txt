[11:01:15] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:01:23] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:01:52] <eddiemonge> yay!
[11:01:52] <b-ot> eddiemonge: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[11:02:12] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:02:16] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:02:17] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:04:40] <toddmparker> how goes
[11:04:55] <toddmparker> let's see if gseguin or johnbender are here
[11:05:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: hi :)
[11:06:09] <johnbender> I've been here I just went back to working while everyone was piling in
[11:07:53] <toddmparker> hi there
[11:07:57] <toddmparker> ok, let's dig in
[11:08:05] <toddmparker> No meeting last week, was on vacation
[11:08:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ is at a conference, not sure if gseguin can join
[11:08:14] <toddmparker> ok
[11:08:33] <toddmparker> New icon set is coming along nicely - uGoMobi, we should look at adding these via grunt icon to see how they work at some point
[11:08:39] <toddmparker> we can help with that
[11:08:45] <toddmparker> Spoke to Dragan who may be able to help us with docs and FAQs
[11:08:53] <toddmparker> he's been active on stack overflow
[11:09:27] <uGoMobi> saw that, nice
[11:09:29] <toddmparker> i just asked him to join this meeting
[11:09:36] <toddmparker> if not, look for him on dev
[11:09:44] <toddmparker> think he's in Croatia
[11:10:09] <toddmparker> somebody suggested that we look at his work so I emailed him
[11:10:12] <toddmparker> and he replied
[11:10:39] <toddmparker> that's it for me. i've unfortunately been swamped forever
[11:10:56] <toddmparker> so…how goes on the content widget johnbender
[11:11:02] <johnbender> good
[11:11:06] <agcolom> Can I go next? (I'm super quick!)
[11:11:08] <johnbender> changePage is now an alias for change
[11:11:20] <toddmparker> sure agcolom
[11:11:21] <agcolom> sorry after johnbender :-)
[11:11:25] <johnbender> nope I can wait
[11:11:27] <johnbender> proceed!
[11:11:29] <agcolom> Ok, thanks
[11:11:47] <agcolom> so just         Icons page: http://api.jquerymobile.com/icons/
[11:11:47] <agcolom>         Minor fixes (typos/rearrangements/added links)
[11:12:01] <agcolom> icons is so we're inline with UI
[11:12:02] * johnbender cheers for gseguin 
[11:12:24] <agcolom> that's all for me. Crazy at work as well at the moment!
[11:12:26] <toddmparker> nice agcolom
[11:12:31] <toddmparker> thanks!
[11:12:31] <gseguin> what? what'd I miss?
[11:12:37] <johnbender> gseguin: we're disbanding
[11:12:46] * johnbender deadpans
[11:12:55] <johnbender> toddmparker: am I up?
[11:12:57] <toddmparker> bye all!
[11:13:01] <johnbender> lol
[11:13:01] <toddmparker> sure johnbender
[11:13:04] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:13:10] <johnbender> so changePage is just for backward compat now
[11:13:19] <gseguin> :)
[11:13:22] <johnbender> I'm breaking up the code into smaller chunks now
[11:13:23] <toddmparker> nice
[11:13:28] <johnbender> tests are going in
[11:13:34] <johnbender> the nav tests seam to be running faster
[11:13:36] <johnbender> could just be me
[11:13:39] <johnbender> me shrugs
[11:13:39] <b-ot> johnbender: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:14:06] <johnbender> also put some notes up on the issue about how things will be composed internally
[11:14:12] <toddmparker> that's a good sign
[11:14:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: it's probably just me though
[11:14:21] <johnbender> not sure
[11:14:32] <johnbender> and we talked with the intel folks about contributing to core and mobile
[11:14:40] <johnbender> personally I don't see how they are going to help core with performance
[11:14:44] <johnbender> possibly with modularity
[11:14:53] <johnbender> but we discussed targetting devices
[11:14:55] <johnbender> via modules
[11:15:01] <johnbender> and I told them it would be a lot of work but it's totally doable
[11:15:06] <johnbender> at least from the JS side
[11:15:08] <toddmparker> how so?
[11:15:34] <johnbender> we'd have to factor bits and bobs out into extensions that make use of features that aren't supported everywhere
[11:15:34] <toddmparker> like conditionally loading widgets based on device capabilities?
[11:15:41] <johnbender> conditionally BUILD
[11:15:41] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:15:53] <johnbender> but yes
[11:15:54] <johnbender> for example
[11:15:56] <johnbender> hashchange support
[11:16:11] <johnbender> you could move that out to a module
[11:16:12] <johnbender> anyhow
[11:16:19] <johnbender> they sounded more interesting in contributing to core
[11:16:24] <toddmparker> so if that's not supported, you just don't include the code
[11:16:26] <johnbender> but both DaveMethvin and I don't see why
[11:16:41] <johnbender> toddmparker: more, "if you don't care about devices" just don't include it in your build
[11:17:00] <toddmparker> devices = mobile devices?
[11:17:01] <johnbender> the module system can do a lot of work for us on that front
[11:17:04] <johnbender> toddmparker: yes
[11:17:06] <arschmitz> so more so like for device specific apps
[11:17:16] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:17:21] <johnbender> so you could imagine meta modules for android and ios devices
[11:17:29] <toddmparker> like phone gap has different js libraries per platform
[11:17:31] <johnbender> toddmparker: the main issue I saw was testing
[11:17:34] <johnbender> but I told them it would be a lot of work
[11:17:42] <johnbender> which they didn't have an issue with
[11:17:44] <toddmparker> yeah, for sure
[11:17:51] <toddmparker> they have a zillion engineers
[11:17:58] <johnbender> you can chat with DaveMethvin about it
[11:18:01] <johnbender> too if you're interested
[11:18:06] <toddmparker> ok, will do
[11:18:17] <toddmparker> so any concrete next steps needed on our side?
[11:18:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: oh also they bought jqmobi
[11:18:24] <johnbender> o.o
[11:18:26] <johnbender> which is why
[11:18:36] <johnbender> they wondered if there wasnt something they could do to contribute or some such
[11:18:39] <toddmparker> yeah, umm
[11:18:40] <johnbender> I came in late though
[11:18:52] <johnbender> lets not get into that
[11:19:03] <johnbender> they are going to go back to their teams
[11:19:07] <johnbender> and talk
[11:19:09] <toddmparker> i appreciate you and _|Nix|_ handling that call.
[11:19:15] <johnbender> and we're supposed to hear back in a few weeks
[11:19:24] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[11:19:38] <johnbender> hmm
[11:19:49] <toddmparker> ?
[11:19:55] <johnbender> it occurs to me that since I came in late all that stuff might have been for our ears only?
[11:19:58] <johnbender> ...
[11:20:06] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez: ^
[11:20:18] * johnbender has his fingers crossed
[11:20:22] <toddmparker> where is the delete all messages command up in here?
[11:20:27] <johnbender> seriously
[11:20:35] <toddmparker> banned.
[11:20:54] <johnbender> I never heard anything to that effect but who knows
[11:20:59] <arschmitz> johnbender: you and DaveMethvin pretty much said all of that in dev
[11:20:59] <johnbender> rworth: ^^
[11:21:01] <toddmparker> i don't think you said anything terribly secret
[11:21:04] <arschmitz> so if so its already too late
[11:21:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: true
[11:21:09] <DaveMethvin> wat
[11:21:10] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Please do the needful.
[11:21:21] <toddmparker> cats out of the bag DaveMethvin
[11:21:21] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: read back a bit
[11:21:22] <DaveMethvin> oh that intel bought jqmobi?
[11:21:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah that was a while back
[11:21:26] <toddmparker> sssshhhh
[11:21:32] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:21:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: well and the stuff we discussed
[11:21:37] <johnbender> I'm just blathering away here
[11:21:40] <johnbender> :(
[11:21:44] <DaveMethvin> nothing top secret
[11:21:46] <johnbender> ok
[11:21:53] * johnbender is relieved
[11:21:56] <toddmparker> c'mon. friends in effect, people
[11:21:58] <DaveMethvin> we never tell johnbender anything we want to keep secret
[11:22:04] <uGoMobi> haha
[11:22:07] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: seriousy
[11:22:10] <toddmparker> frieNDA
[11:22:12] <johnbender> toddmparker: anyway that's it for me
[11:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry, the IRC logger is broken right now :-P
[11:22:30] <uGoMobi> I guess Intel hacked it
[11:22:34] <toddmparker> so our secrets are safe. whew.
[11:23:21] <toddmparker> ok, we'll see what Intel comes back with. Sounds like they are mostly going to fix all of DaveMethvin's woes in core :)
[11:23:32] <DaveMethvin> thank goodness
[11:23:44] <toddmparker> can you bulk assign all GH issues to them?
[11:23:51] <DaveMethvin> lol
[11:23:57] <DaveMethvin> now yer talkin
[11:24:20] <toddmparker> ok, thanks for the update on that johnbender, been meaning to get a debrief
[11:24:31] <toddmparker> anything else you want to discuss?
[11:25:56] <toddmparker> { crickets }
[11:26:08] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: how goes in Next?
[11:26:17] <uGoMobi> pretty good
[11:26:32] <uGoMobi> feel like I am almost finished
[11:26:47] <uGoMobi> with all the markup and theme inheritance changes that is
[11:27:01] <toddmparker> amazing
[11:27:06] <uGoMobi> for examples of new markup see http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/theming/
[11:28:30] <toddmparker> looks great
[11:28:30] <uGoMobi> one issue
[11:28:37] <uGoMobi> inheritance of popup theme or collapsible content theme
[11:29:12] <toddmparker> is there a popup there?
[11:29:25] <uGoMobi> uhh... no sorry
[11:29:45] <uGoMobi> the problem comes with "group theme inheritance"
[11:29:47] <toddmparker> so i dunno what to do there
[11:30:12] <toddmparker> right now a popup and collapsible content are just always the default theme?
[11:30:20] <uGoMobi> when you set a theme for a listview for example all buttons in there inherit that theme without adding a class
[11:30:30] <toddmparker> that is awesome
[11:30:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, that's not the problem
[11:30:48] <uGoMobi> you can set theme for popups and collapsible content
[11:31:02] <uGoMobi> it's about the widgets in the popup or collapsible
[11:31:07] <toddmparker> ah, i see
[11:31:24] <toddmparker> so if the popup is D, all the widgets inside will be the default?
[11:31:47] <uGoMobi> I can make those inherit the theme from the popup but then you can't set theme for a listview anymore without issues
[11:32:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: they will inherit the theme from the page, not the popup
[11:32:23] <toddmparker> i think the mod important thing is making the list views as light as possible
[11:32:47] <uGoMobi> I agree
[11:32:49] <toddmparker> personally, i think it would be ok to just document these kind of changes
[11:32:58] <toddmparker> and not involve js
[11:33:03] <toddmparker> that gets us into trouble
[11:33:18] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:33:45] <uGoMobi> if this is the only thing that won't work anymore I think it's acceptable
[11:34:09] <arschmitz> seems minor since you can still set a theme just have to do it manually right?
[11:34:16] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:34:17] <arschmitz> it wont inherit
[11:34:20] <uGoMobi> true
[11:34:34] <toddmparker> than, yeah. let's document this in the blog post and be done
[11:34:37] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats not too big a deal in those two cases
[11:34:45] <toddmparker> small price to pay
[11:35:03] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:35:07] <arschmitz> yeah will just be one of those cavets of the library
[11:35:29] <toddmparker> pretty minor. "we apply a bit less magic"
[11:35:29] <uGoMobi> so then there are just a few small things I have to give a look
[11:35:57] <toddmparker> that is great. you've done an amazing job on all this uGoMobi
[11:35:59] <uGoMobi> and I can start updating tests, demos and docs
[11:36:04] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:36:07] <toddmparker> sort of an epic task
[11:36:34] <toddmparker> while we're in there, do we have any other theme changes to add?
[11:36:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, but a nice task
[11:36:45] <toddmparker> you already added swatch-level active states, right?
[11:36:52] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:36:57] <arschmitz> thats a big one
[11:37:01] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:37:20] <uGoMobi> the icon stuff like you said
[11:37:23] <toddmparker> maybe we just need an inset class that adds inner shadow?
[11:37:33] <uGoMobi> we have that
[11:37:37] <uGoMobi> I added it to slider
[11:37:38] <toddmparker> oh, nice
[11:37:44] <uGoMobi> and flip switch
[11:37:49] <toddmparker> nice
[11:38:09] <toddmparker> so icons are the last big item but that could be post-next > master
[11:38:21] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:38:45] <toddmparker> rather get this merged so we have more people testing
[11:38:46] <uGoMobi> and this is just a first pass on new default theme
[11:38:56] <uGoMobi> needs tweaking
[11:38:57] <toddmparker> how many swatches are in this?
[11:39:05] <uGoMobi> specially the "B" light swatch
[11:39:11] <uGoMobi> just two
[11:39:13] <toddmparker> ah
[11:39:22] <toddmparker> so the default mapping is tricky
[11:39:39] <uGoMobi> sorry, what do you mean?
[11:40:00] <toddmparker> we have all kinds of defaults - headers are A, content C, etc.
[11:40:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: not anymore
[11:40:16] <uGoMobi> almost no defaults
[11:40:31] <toddmparker> so what happens when someone updates to 1.4?
[11:40:36] <uGoMobi> just for the page, loader and dialog (overlay)
[11:40:41] <toddmparker> and they assumed some of these mappings?
[11:41:02] <uGoMobi> we have to mention this in the blog post
[11:41:09] <uGoMobi> I added this in the changelog
[11:41:18] <arschmitz> ugrading to 1.4 will involve some work for sure
[11:41:20] <toddmparker> ok, so this is another documentation thing
[11:41:24] <uGoMobi> all info about defaults/ inheritance
[11:42:00] <toddmparker> ideally, we'd default everything to A
[11:42:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I will add a "theming" info page to the demo center
[11:42:08] <toddmparker> and maybe have gray = A
[11:42:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that's what happens now
[11:42:21] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[11:42:25] <uGoMobi> so you just need one swatch
[11:42:27] <toddmparker> thought A = dark
[11:42:30] <toddmparker> cool
[11:42:35] <toddmparker> you're always a step ahead
[11:42:39] <uGoMobi> and not swatch E because the loader error message happens to be swatch E
[11:43:00] <toddmparker> figure it could all be a, event that
[11:43:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes A is dark for the moment, I meant everything ends up using swatch A
[11:43:08] <toddmparker> so you don't need multi-swatch themes
[11:43:29] <toddmparker> ok, so we just need to swap A and B colors
[11:43:30] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:43:39] <toddmparker> nice
[11:43:44] <uGoMobi> maybe we should do 3 swatches
[11:43:53] <toddmparker> ok, well finish up what's left but this looks damn close
[11:43:56] <uGoMobi> dark - gray - very light
[11:44:11] <toddmparker> i think we can ship with a default theme that has multiple swatches for sure
[11:44:29] <toddmparker> or at least offer it
[11:44:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I was also thinking about shipping the old default theme with 1.4
[11:44:39] <agcolom> Can I ask why we're going for squarer corners?
[11:44:41] <toddmparker> the docs assume multiple swatches for the examples
[11:44:44] <uGoMobi> "classic"
[11:45:03] <agcolom> (just curious)
[11:45:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, we need to update those
[11:45:20] <toddmparker> i 100% agree this needs to happen, but I see this causing the most upgrade confusion so we need to keep an eye on that
[11:45:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I thought it was more modern
[11:45:30] <arschmitz> i like the smaller radius personally
[11:45:44] <toddmparker> yeah, think a smaller radius is more mod
[11:45:49] * johnbender is starving and needs to get food.
[11:45:49] <toddmparker> and flatter
[11:45:54] * johnbender will be right back.
[11:45:57] <toddmparker> ok, thanks johnbender
[11:46:04] <agcolom> Yes, was just purely curious
[11:46:07] <toddmparker> but we can refine the themes a bit
[11:46:17] <toddmparker> think offering a theme with the old mappings might be good too
[11:46:30] <toddmparker> but ship with a simpler 2 or 3 swatch by default
[11:46:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, might help people updating
[11:47:43] <uGoMobi> The theme swatch for pages does no longer default to "c" but "a". Dialog overlays still default to "a". The loader theme defaults to "a" instead of "e". Headers and footers don't have default "a" anymore but inherit the page theme. List dividers don't default to "b" but inherit the list theme. Count bubbles in listviews don't default to "c" anymore, but
[11:47:43] <uGoMobi> inherit from the LI/button/divider. Count bubbles in multiple selects always had theme "c" but now always inherit the theme from the button.
[11:47:51] <uGoMobi> that's in the changelog
[11:48:18] <uGoMobi> I don't think it's very complicated for people to update
[11:48:50] <agcolom> Just an idea (which may be crazy, please don't scream ;-) you're allowed to just say NO!) ;-) how about having a script that could tell people what issues they're likely to encounter when updating from their current version to 1.4 ?
[11:48:51] <toddmparker> cool
[11:49:00] * johnbender is back
[11:49:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: seems like more then anything its going to force people to specifiy their theme everywhere instead of just leaving default
[11:49:15] <toddmparker> agcolom: i like the idea, but it seems hard to do the analysis
[11:49:23] <toddmparker> arschmitz: right
[11:49:28] <arschmitz> well assuming they dont want everything the same color :)
[11:49:30] <toddmparker> when in doubt, spec it
[11:49:31] <agcolom> yes, that was my worry ;-)
[11:49:45] <toddmparker> think we tried to be too smart on that front
[11:49:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think many people only have multiple swatches so they don't need to set a theme
[11:50:00] <toddmparker> if i could do it all over, i'd have it all be A, like now
[11:50:05] <uGoMobi> like that graphite theme from codiqa
[11:50:21] <toddmparker> yeah, they were saying that swatches confused them so...
[11:50:51] <uGoMobi> could be done with one swatch but has multiple swatches because we set defaults other than A
[11:51:38] <arschmitz> yeah but correct me if im wrong but there is not way to have a blue button on a grey theme without multiple swatches right?
[11:51:51] <arschmitz> or custom css
[11:52:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: true
[11:52:34] <uGoMobi> so if you want multiple buttons with different colors you have to use multiple swatches
[11:52:41] <arschmitz> right
[11:52:51] <uGoMobi> that's the nice thing about having a theming system
[11:53:08] <uGoMobi> but I think it's best when it's possible but not necessary
[11:53:19] <arschmitz> yeah i was just saying i think that most of the time multiple themes will still be needed
[11:53:25] <arschmitz> swatches rather
[11:53:40] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:53:56] <uGoMobi> yeah for buttons probably
[11:54:49] <uGoMobi> ok that was it for me... arschmitz ?
[11:55:23] <arschmitz> fixed directories showing on jquerymobile.com
[11:55:28] <toddmparker> yeah, most people will want 2 swatches at a minimum for some contrast
[11:55:40] <toddmparker> thanks uGoMobi
[11:55:43] <toddmparker> how goes arschmitz
[11:55:56] <arschmitz> i was also added to infrastructure so any infra needs we have i can now help with
[11:56:35] <arschmitz> the new toolbar widget is now on master and page.sections is gone
[11:56:56] <arschmitz> adds true persistant toolbars and toolbars outside pages
[11:57:10] <arschmitz> i think we should depreciate our current persistant toolbars
[11:57:43] <arschmitz> they are pretty complicated to fake the effect of persistance
[11:58:24] <arschmitz> thoughts?
[11:59:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but will it still be an option?
[12:00:09] <arschmitz> it would not be an option if you want peristant toolbars just place them outside the page
[12:00:09] <uGoMobi> I mean, if I have a footer with navbar what would I have to do to make it persistent?
[12:00:19] <arschmitz> put it outside the page
[12:00:29] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[12:00:30] <arschmitz> and init it yourself
[12:00:55] <arschmitz> because if its outside the page its not effected by transitions or nav
[12:00:59] <arschmitz> so its truely persistant
[12:01:12] <uGoMobi> how about updatPagePadding
[12:01:14] <arschmitz> transitions are much smoother this way
[12:01:17] <uGoMobi> that still works?
[12:01:21] <arschmitz> update page padding works fine
[12:01:24] <uGoMobi> nice
[12:01:33] <arschmitz> it just acts on the active page if its not within a page
[12:02:34] <arschmitz> the current persistant toolbars are a bit buggy on the complicated transitions
[12:02:40] <agcolom> Is that going in for 1.4 as well?
[12:02:55] <toddmparker> sorry, got pulled off
[12:03:01] <arschmitz> yes its already in master
[12:03:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think it will cause issues with handling the active state of navbar buttons in persistent toolbars?
[12:03:37] <toddmparker> arschmitz: nice
[12:03:45] <uGoMobi> if we deprecate the option like it is now
[12:03:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm not 100% sure but i dont think so
[12:04:01] <toddmparker> would i ever make sense to just move persistent toolbars outside of the page for people?
[12:04:05] <arschmitz> i have a test page need to check that
[12:04:13] <toddmparker> so it works as before
[12:04:19] <toddmparker> but has the benefits of the new markup
[12:04:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if i follow i think thats what im suggesting
[12:05:07] <toddmparker> ok then
[12:05:21] <toddmparker> so would pre-1.4 markup still work as-is?
[12:05:22] <arschmitz> basiclu depreciate the current functionality of them for 1.4
[12:05:33] <arschmitz> so in 1.4 old way would work
[12:05:37] <arschmitz> but remove it for 1.5
[12:06:18] <toddmparker> just wondering if we need to remove it at all
[12:06:31] <uGoMobi> why?
[12:06:41] <arschmitz> we dont need to but it adds a lot of code and complication to fixed toolbars
[12:06:43] <uGoMobi> I think it's a nice feature
[12:06:47] <arschmitz> and the transitions are buggy
[12:07:08] <arschmitz> and you can acheive the same thing but less buggy by placing them outside the page
[12:07:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now you are talking about current way right?
[12:07:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes the current way is complicated and buggy
[12:07:50] <uGoMobi> but new way (move markup outside) page isn't
[12:07:55] <arschmitz> right
[12:08:00] <arschmitz> it requires nothing
[12:08:04] <uGoMobi> great
[12:08:06] <arschmitz> there is no code for it
[12:08:08] <uGoMobi> +1
[12:08:12] <arschmitz> its just works
[12:08:26] <uGoMobi> that are the best features :)
[12:08:37] <agcolom> can I just ask something?
[12:08:39] <arschmitz> actually all toolbars outside of a page are persistant it is the responsibility of the dev to manage anything outside the page
[12:08:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: of course
[12:09:01] <agcolom> If I understand correctly, to have a fixed toolbar, have it outside the page right?
[12:09:09] <arschmitz> no
[12:09:11] <toddmparker> so how do you handle on states for a persistent navbar if it's a single, shared navbar
[12:09:12] <uGoMobi> persistent
[12:09:16] <arschmitz> just to have a persistant fixed toolbar
[12:09:21] <agcolom> ok!
[12:09:28] <agcolom> Sorry! I'm with you then!
[12:09:38] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem
[12:09:45] <toddmparker> btw - i agree the current way is messy
[12:09:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, I was asking the same... I think that's something we need to look into
[12:09:56] <toddmparker> right
[12:10:06] <uGoMobi> but I am sure we can come up with something
[12:10:15] <toddmparker> 1. how to do indicate which pages should have the navbar
[12:10:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: im pretty sure that already works but i need to double check
[12:10:25] <uGoMobi> when we have the tabview widget we might want some handling of active state for that too
[12:10:26] <toddmparker> 2. how to do on states
[12:10:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker: which pages is uptothe dev
[12:10:38] <toddmparker> 3. how to deal with deep-linking
[12:10:51] <arschmitz> if you place something outside a page its not handled by nav any more
[12:10:57] <toddmparker> seems like this new approach only works if you have a multi-page doc, right?
[12:11:09] <arschmitz> so if you want it to show on one and not another you have to hide and show it yourself
[12:11:13] <arschmitz> no
[12:11:16] <agcolom> Sorry just to be 100% sure, by persitent, do we mean a header/footer that is always present for a given page?
[12:11:27] <toddmparker> agcolom: *across* pages
[12:11:32] <arschmitz> it works on all page setups single or multi page
[12:11:39] <agcolom> right ok that was what I was after ;-)
[12:11:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/toolbars/footer-persist-a.html
[12:12:19] <toddmparker> ^ in this example, how does it work if you want to support separate ajax pages lil sit is now?
[12:12:20] <agcolom> yes, ok, I'm all clear :-)
[12:12:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i actually already have that same example working with the new way
[12:13:20] <toddmparker> cool
[12:13:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/headers/footer-persist-d.php
[12:13:39] <toddmparker> we can discuss offline, but i'm in favor of making big changes here
[12:13:55] <arschmitz> those are external persistant toolbars
[12:14:02] <arschmitz> and i do need to fix active state :)
[12:14:05] <uGoMobi> I think many people would like it because you can reuse markup
[12:14:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly
[12:14:27] <arschmitz> only need to load it once
[12:14:30] <arschmitz> not with every page
[12:14:36] <arschmitz> and no need to re init the widgets
[12:14:41] <uGoMobi> that demo looks good arschmitz
[12:14:41] <arschmitz> so sppeds things up too
[12:14:44] <toddmparker> nice
[12:14:48] <agcolom> yes, that's really good!
[12:14:56] <toddmparker> so this doesn't yet cover on states but it looks nice
[12:15:00] <_|Nix|_> Hey! You guys still meeting?
[12:15:06] <toddmparker> hi _|Nix|_
[12:15:06] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[12:15:07] <toddmparker> yep
[12:15:12] <_|Nix|_> I just broke for lunch.
[12:15:22] <uGoMobi> yes _|Nix|_ we were waiting for you... let's start
[12:15:23] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:15:26] <arschmitz> yup need to fix states think i held off to see what uGoMobi did with that in next now that i think about it
[12:15:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: :)
[12:15:53] <arschmitz> ok so moving on listviews now work outside pages
[12:15:59] <arschmitz> and nested listviews have been removed
[12:16:01] <toddmparker> arschmitz: awesome
[12:16:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we need to refactor navbar widget anyway
[12:16:11] <_|Nix|_> +1.0e6
[12:16:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i agree
[12:16:30] <arschmitz> i have my own extended version we should look at in dev
[12:16:58] <arschmitz> made a first pass at panels outside pages
[12:17:04] <arschmitz> they are looking really good so far
[12:17:09] <toddmparker> nice
[12:17:15] <toddmparker> man, great work all around
[12:17:17] <arschmitz> everything is functional and just needs some css tweaking
[12:17:27] <arschmitz> in branch ext-panels
[12:17:32] <agcolom> (OMG I'm thinking of all the things I'll have to update in my lectures for the next academic year ;-) ) But I'm 100% +1 with all the changes :-)
[12:18:01] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/ext-panels/demos/widgets/panels/external.php
[12:18:27] <arschmitz> also looked into pointer event polyfills
[12:18:36] <arschmitz> none will help us with vClick
[12:18:45] <arschmitz> but will replace the rest of vmouse
[12:19:00] <arschmitz> ui has started https://github.com/jquery/jquery-pointer-events
[12:19:28] <arschmitz> looked into other fast click solutions for vClick but none seem as robust as ours and have same issues
[12:20:08] <arschmitz> going to work on adding pointer support to vClick kinblas is going to help as needed he said for me to just ping him with anything i need
[12:20:25] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:20:51] <arschmitz> thats it for me other then just triage and some bug fixes
[12:21:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and your tabview widget is looking pretty good already too
[12:22:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yea thats not new though havent done any new work on that in a while just need to get with you to make some css decisions and then merge
[12:22:46] <uGoMobi> well, that demo page was new to me ;)
[12:23:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: really i shared it in a meeting before im pretty sure
[12:23:09] <arschmitz> well if not i will again
[12:23:17] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/tabs/demos/widgets/tabs/
[12:23:24] <uGoMobi> ohw sorry, then I missed that
[12:23:46] <arschmitz> either way
[12:23:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: Pointer events: Can you look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5991?
[12:24:00] <johnbender> tabs nice
[12:24:01] <toddmparker> that is cool stuff arschmitz
[12:24:04] <johnbender> :)
[12:24:05] <agcolom> Nice arschmitz !
[12:24:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah sure
[12:24:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[12:25:32] <arschmitz> oh also started setting up test pages trying to see what ui widgets i can get to work right out of the box like tabs
[12:25:41] <arschmitz> but thats not ready quite yet
[12:26:03] <toddmparker> that will be very interesting to see
[12:26:09] <uGoMobi> maybe we should keep some good stuff for 1.5 ;)
[12:26:26] <uGoMobi> already so much for 1.4
[12:26:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol
[12:26:30] <toddmparker> plenty of goodies to come
[12:26:35] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[12:26:37] <toddmparker> yeah, true tho
[12:26:45] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think we ever need to worry about not having enough for a release lol
[12:27:03] <toddmparker> so i guess getting next into master is pretty key so arschmitz and _|Nix|_ and do the API pass?
[12:27:04] <uGoMobi> and we still need to do a lot of widget review
[12:27:08] <agcolom> We need to make sure the docs are ready also...
[12:27:09] <toddmparker> yar
[12:27:12] <toddmparker> right
[12:27:21] <arschmitz> actually im going to start heling with tests on next
[12:27:28] <toddmparker> great
[12:27:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: updating tests and demo center will take some time
[12:27:46] <arschmitz> and start doing widget reviews in next so we can do it while ugmobie is working on demos and stuff
[12:27:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and _|Nix|_ could start in next
[12:28:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly
[12:29:02] <_|Nix|_> I guess "next" is not far removed from master, if at all, because uGoMobi has been merging conscientiously.
[12:29:08] <toddmparker> nice
[12:29:10] <uGoMobi> and I didn't change widgets like panel and table so those can be reviewed on master
[12:29:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah we just need to make sure we continue to do it
[12:29:20] <_|Nix|_> So, we can definitely get going on the widget review side.
[12:29:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, everything from master is in next
[12:29:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but master changes very little now ...
[12:29:38] <toddmparker> that would be great, lots to review
[12:29:57] <arschmitz> so ALMOST all widgets work outside pages now i think
[12:29:59] <uGoMobi> so I can update tests of one widget so you guys can look into the JS and then I move on to the next widget
[12:30:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, that's cool, actually. Widget review is GO GO GO!
[12:30:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah as soon as uGoMobi gives us the go ahead on stuff in next
[12:31:00] <uGoMobi> any idea which widget you guys want to start with?
[12:31:11] <arschmitz> im thinking form widgets
[12:31:14] <arschmitz> they are simple
[12:31:24] <arschmitz> so good place to start before more complicated ones
[12:31:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ?
[12:31:39] <uGoMobi> ok, they are all ready
[12:32:12] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[12:32:17] <uGoMobi> I think I only need to make small change in navbar and collapsible (set) JS to make setting theme for the group work with CSS
[12:32:18] <arschmitz> awesome
[12:32:34] <_|Nix|_> Destroying a checkboxradio will be fun.
[12:32:57] <uGoMobi> there are a few widgets that are missing options
[12:33:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome when we get to that one we should look at refactoring for persistance and tabs
[12:33:11] <uGoMobi> like textinput and slider needs option corners
[12:33:25] <uGoMobi> I can do that or you guys can do it will reviewing
[12:33:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool either way options are simple enough
[12:33:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you make an issue so we don't forget?
[12:33:56] <uGoMobi> there is a ticket for the textinput
[12:33:59] <arschmitz> so whoever gets to that widget first should be able to handle it
[12:34:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Great!
[12:34:04] <uGoMobi> will check if there is one for slider
[12:34:14] <uGoMobi> or I just add the option :)
[12:34:30] <uGoMobi> it's only about adding class ui-corner-all or not
[12:34:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[12:34:54] <uGoMobi> but slider code is almost unreadable :(
[12:35:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah we need to discuss slider
[12:35:20] <uGoMobi> we have everything in create as well as in refresh
[12:35:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You had an idea about handling widgets that require wrappers without copying classes over. How was that again?
[12:35:28] <arschmitz> and figure out where to go with it and if ui slider might be a workable solution
[12:35:30] <uGoMobi> and 100+ vars
[12:35:41] <arschmitz> data-classes
[12:35:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Corners on textinputs are in that category.
[12:35:46] <arschmitz> and data-id
[12:35:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right!
[12:36:12] <arschmitz> whatever you put in data-classes will end up on wrapper
[12:36:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3577#issuecomment-18002047
[12:36:17] <arschmitz> same with id
[12:36:20] <toddmparker> good idea
[12:36:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right!
[12:36:38] <arschmitz> eliminates all weirdness with copying stuff or prefixing
[12:36:45] <arschmitz> just set what you want and we add it
[12:36:56] <arschmitz> its faster too
[12:37:02] <toddmparker> i like that personally. addresses removing the visual options (shadows, corners) and the need to have a custom class or id to style against
[12:37:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: exactly
[12:37:22] <toddmparker> however, if we rely on this how do we handle defaults?
[12:37:27] <arschmitz> gives complete control to set it how you want
[12:37:51] <toddmparker> for example, buttons have corners, shadows by default
[12:37:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i was thinking about this for just non defualt custom stuff
[12:38:15] <toddmparker> i'd hate to have to add data-class="corners shadows"
[12:38:24] <toddmparker> to everything
[12:38:35] <arschmitz> so like if you want to add a class foobar to the wrapper you just do data-classes="foobar"
[12:38:43] <arschmitz> this should not be for setting defaults
[12:38:46] <toddmparker> ok
[12:38:59] <arschmitz> defualts should be an option of their own i think
[12:39:11] <arschmitz> so like data-corners should not go away
[12:39:39] <arschmitz> i think defaults = options basicly
[12:39:52] <arschmitz> and classes will now be an option
[12:40:06] <toddmparker> ok, fine
[12:40:06] <arschmitz> of additional classes to add to the wrapper
[12:40:18] <toddmparker> so we add an id and a class option to each widget
[12:40:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am think some of this could be done same way as I did for theme inheritance
[12:40:25] <toddmparker> or only widgets that are wrapped?
[12:40:33] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: how's that?
[12:40:36] <arschmitz> only wrapped widgets
[12:40:44] <uGoMobi> add class ui-corners to a container or page and everything that can have corners will get corners
[12:40:49] <arschmitz> otherwise you can just put them in class on the element
[12:41:04] <uGoMobi> like what I did with icon shadow
[12:41:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think that makes sense
[12:41:28] <uGoMobi> any icon gets the icon shadow as soon as there is a container with that class
[12:41:47] <uGoMobi> (same as icon-alt and icon-nodisc)
[12:45:12] <uGoMobi> * cricket *
[12:45:18] <toddmparker> make sense to me
[12:45:37] <toddmparker> css ftw
[12:45:42] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:45:44] <toddmparker> ok, we should probably wrap soon
[12:45:53] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: anything you'd like to chat about?
[12:45:53] <arschmitz> yeah been a long one
[12:45:53] <uGoMobi> yeah we are running late
[12:46:02] <toddmparker> 2 weeks of meetings
[12:46:03] <uGoMobi> soooooo much going on
[12:46:08] <toddmparker> yep, which is great
[12:46:37] <arschmitz> yeah work moving at a very fast pace on 1.4
[12:49:32] <toddmparker> not that i've been any help. sorry about that
[12:51:52] <toddmparker> alright, thanks everyone. great work.
[12:51:57] <toddmparker> any Q's from the community?
[12:52:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: someone ask on -dev where we post meeting agenda
[12:52:42] <uGoMobi> asked*
[12:52:49] <toddmparker> we're in between places right now
[12:52:54] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:52:56] <toddmparker> we need to bulk upload these
[12:53:40] <arschmitz> you still tweet them right?
[12:54:04] <arschmitz> so they could check our twitter feed?
[12:54:24] <toddmparker> i haven't been
[12:54:37] <toddmparker> usually, i'd upload to the updates.jquery.org site
[12:54:50] <toddmparker> but there is a new workflow that involved markdown and git
[12:55:10] <arschmitz> yeah i knew something had changed didnt know details though
[12:55:16] <toddmparker> agcolom: i'd really appreciate it if you could help me copy the meeting notes from google docs to the new system
[12:55:29] <toddmparker> could you ask scott_gonzalez for info on how to get set up?
[12:59:32] <toddmparker> ok all, think we should wrap up
[12:59:34] <toddmparker> thanks again
