[14:01:56] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, nashvail, arschmitz, kristy
[14:02:07] <nashvail> Hey!
[14:02:18] <kristy> hello
[14:02:37] <sfrisk> So I'm gonna start out by saying I have not had time to review stuff this week
[14:02:57] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:03:05] <geekman-rohit> same for me too I guess
[14:03:11] <sfrisk> or pull stuff in
[14:03:15] <kristy> Yay I don't feel so alone
[14:03:24] <kristy> I had such plans.. but they were foiled
[14:03:31] <sfrisk> the past week was a bit crazy
[14:04:04] <sfrisk> and I have a lot of notes about pulling stuff into branches
[14:04:16] <sfrisk> to put up on views and stuff
[14:04:21] <sfrisk> but again have not gotten to it
[14:04:33] <sfrisk> so I'm going to do some of that stuff right now
[14:05:14] <sfrisk> pulling in the two commits into master
[14:05:31] <sfrisk> and putting the other stuff up on views
[14:05:43] <sfrisk> the ones that go up in views, I'll comment on those issues with the URL to review
[14:05:51] <sfrisk> anything else people had to bring up?
[14:08:14] <geekman-rohit> nope
[14:08:48] <geekman-rohit> no agenda today then?
[14:10:12] <sfrisk> I mean there is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:10:27] <sfrisk> pretty much I'm going through the list of stuff that was supposed to be pulled in, or put up onto views and doing that
[14:12:39] <nashvail> I have added the multiline demos
[14:15:27] <sfrisk> okay, going to put inputs and notifications in their own branches
[14:16:03] <nashvail> Will those branches be updated as I push improvements to my fork?
[14:16:15] <sfrisk> nope, I'll have to push your updates up
[14:17:23] <nashvail> alright
[14:21:17] <sfrisk> so just ping me when you get updates and I'll update stuff
[14:22:20] <sfrisk> okay if there isn't anything else, I'm going to shut this meeting down. I'll ping everyone on issues once stuff is up in views
