[09:00:57] <rworth> hey
[09:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[09:01:58] <kborchers> hi there
[09:02:16] <kborchers> grabbing coffee, brb
[09:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> Let's get started.
[09:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Any update on color?
[09:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> Guess he's not here yet.
[09:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers, rworth: Docs update?
[09:04:57] <rworth> I got nuthin
[09:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> I can actually start helping with docs this week if nobody needs me on anything else.
[09:05:40] <kborchers> back
[09:06:27] <jzaefferer> at some point soon we need to plan out themeroller and how that relates to the future of themes and mobile compability/integration in general
[09:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but unfortunately we cannot delay 1.9 for that.
[09:07:55] <jzaefferer> so what's the plan, just porting the php-themeroller to node?
[09:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:08:15] <jzaefferer> okay...
[09:08:28] <jzaefferer> well, with download builder in place, it might not be that bad
[09:08:39] <jzaefferer> we'll probably just stick with image magick
[09:08:53] <jzaefferer> so yeah, Scott on docs seems fine
[09:09:25] <jzaefferer> I smell fresh air (aka inbox zero), so with Rafael's help I hope to wrap up download builder in the next days
[09:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Any updates on download builder? Sounds like things are moving smoothly.
[09:11:38] <jzaefferer> landing Rafael's stats PR just now
[09:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nice.
[09:11:47] <jzaefferer> he'll be working on things later today, too
[09:12:14] <jzaefferer> going for the server-everything-from-memory approach
[09:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:12:51] <jzaefferer> that we can just pre-fork the node-process if we ever get too many concurrent downloads
[09:12:56] <jzaefferer> *that way
[09:13:13] <jzaefferer> but it should just be fast enough to not matter with the traffic we have
[09:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> I made a lot of progress on the release script: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js
[09:14:10] <gnarf> here now
[09:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> DO NOT RUN THAT
[09:14:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not this week
[09:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> It does everything the old release script did, plus a little bit more.
[09:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> Hoping to add even more to it, though some of the pieces don't exist yet (like generating all the themes).
[09:15:24] <jzaefferer> just a little MORE AWESOME
[09:16:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this week is probably getting your auto pull script work
[09:16:32] <gnarf> ing
[09:16:49] <rworth> awesome
[09:17:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: along with some monitoring based tasks i need to get done
[09:17:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'll come back through color once more
[09:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:21:19] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, the menu methods thing looks like it could be done somewhat quickly, maybe can deal with that before docs?
[09:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Was there any progress on jqueryui.com?
[09:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I was going to try to tackle them together. Since it's a question of how to document the methods.
[09:22:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i haven't pushed anything. had some questions. here is what i've done ...
[09:22:28] <kborchers> http://cl.ly/image/3j382L1z2k1k shows the api list styled with the borders/backgrounds, categories moved to upper-right corner
[09:23:01] <kborchers> http://cl.ly/image/072q2W0Y0s1s shows chopping off the text in search back as the window gets smaller so it doesn't wrap out of it
[09:23:40] <kborchers> http://cl.ly/image/2H2J2A363m41 shows even smaller window and the widget names shrinking to fit (more important for core api)
[09:23:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, that makes sense
[09:23:56] <jzaefferer> more bird stoning
[09:24:28] <kborchers> http://cl.ly/image/2R1F0V291p3o core api view and also the nav at the top (Plugins, Downloadâ€¦) was unclickable in chrome and that is fixed
[09:25:15] <kborchers> now the questions
[09:25:22] <jzaefferer> kborchers: not answering your questions, but: whenever you feel like not pushing something, push it to a branch
[09:25:39] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok
[09:25:46] <kborchers> i'll do that later
[09:25:56] <jzaefferer> kborchers: don't pull a Scott ;)
[09:26:05] <kborchers> http://cl.ly/image/0a0E0v0s1d26 this has had some styling done but does not match the mockups. not sure which to go with
[09:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The difference is that he isn't using random locations on his hard drive. He's probably using local branches :-P
[09:27:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you have too much faith, just using local master right now but can pull off to a branch if i need to :P
[09:28:04] <kborchers> bigger question, how are you mac folks testing sites in IE? because i have set up hosts file and wordpress won't let me access directly, i can't view from browserstack
[09:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Why doesn't BrowserStack work for you?
[09:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1R410R3h272D
[09:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> Also, are you using VirtualBox?
[09:31:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: does that include the local tunnel?
[09:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yeah
[09:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> Notice the URL is dev.
[09:31:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: FYI If you want a copy of VMWare Fusion - we obtained a few
[09:32:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: this is what i get with local tunner
[09:32:02] <kborchers> tunnel
[09:32:06] <kborchers> http://cl.ly/image/3c2S3x0N3p3d
[09:32:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: and i'm not using virtual box because i removed my copy of windows from there to install via bootcamp so i could do blackberry dev :/
[09:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'll help you figure out what's going on with BrowserStack after the meeting.
[09:33:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, probably something stupid configured on my end
[09:34:04] <kborchers> otherwise, any thoughts on what i've done so far?
[09:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[09:34:19] <kborchers> most of those changes have been in base css so they do effect all sites
[09:34:27] <kborchers> from what i've seen it is fine
[09:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:34:44] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Working on 100 sites at once :-P
[09:34:57] <rworth> :)
[09:35:06] <kborchers> i have made some changes in other places so i'll want review of those to see if it could have been done better or somewhere else
[09:35:12] <kborchers> i'll push to a branch for review
[09:35:38] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully everyone noticed that 1.8.22 went out yesterday.
[09:35:57] <kborchers> been trying to keep the css rules as specific as possible too to prevent messing up other sites and seems like it's working but i'm sure i haven't looked at every site
[09:36:33] <scott_gonzalez> That adds support for jQuery 1.8 (bringing us up to 18 versions of jQuery that we support).
[09:36:45] <kborchers> o.O
[09:36:51] <kborchers> fun :)
[09:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> I started putting together the upgrade guide: https://gist.github.com/4b08ed85f1302cf1005b
[09:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone has thoughts about how it's laid out or how to improve it, let me know.
[09:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> It'll probably take me several days to finish it. There's a LOT to write about.
[09:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's everything.
[09:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else they want to discuss?
[09:40:51] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:41:05] <jzaefferer> also that upgrade guide looks really good :-)
[09:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> thanks :-)
[09:42:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you had a question about pushing a release the other day
[09:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I figured it out. :-)
[09:42:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool - still need to figure out what to do about permissions on some of those directories
[09:43:10] <gnarf> like maybe by default i should make those directories "world writable" so we can not have to worry as much about which user is logging in
[09:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> Is this an issue for most servers or just the CDN?
[09:44:54] <jzaefferer> gnarf: are you talking about having to sudo for `git pull`?
[09:45:59] <gnarf> jzaefferer: no - talking about arbitrary users being able to scp files to code.origin.jquery.com
[09:46:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: needing to sudo for a git pull on the wordpress stuff isn't a huge problem for me
[09:46:54] <gnarf> considering at some point, this will be done by a "bot"
[09:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm not sure it matters, everyone can just use the same user for the CDN.
[09:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's protected by SSH keys anyway.
[09:47:12] <gnarf> (that point is hopefully this week)
[09:47:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - I'm just a little weary of making that "everyuser" user
[09:48:07] <gnarf> i know jqadmin@ has been pretty common for things like this though - so we might just continue to use it
[09:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> Could you make a user that only has permission to write to that one directory?
[09:48:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: something like cdn@code.origin.jquery.com ?
[09:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:49:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: probably - my only concern is in making sure that the right SSH keys are installed for that user
[09:49:15] <gnarf> also - some things need to be owned by "jenkins" to allow copying the -git files around
[09:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> World writale seems fine if that's easier to manage.
[09:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> s/writale/writable/
[09:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't mkae too much of an actual difference in terms of security.
[09:50:15] <gnarf> maybe I'll just make a "cdn" group
[09:50:39] <gnarf> then add jenkins and setup a chgrp -R cdn / chmod -R g+w
[09:50:44] <gnarf> cron
[09:51:08] <gnarf> that way not everyone with access has access by default
[09:51:18] <gnarf> like clarkbox probably wont need to put a file on the cdn
[09:51:18] <gnarf> :)
[09:51:41] <gnarf> still puzzling that one through
[09:53:54] <gnarf> it seems the group would be easier than making sure the right ssh keys are on the "general" user
[09:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> seems fine
