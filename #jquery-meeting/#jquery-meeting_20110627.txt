[09:05:25] <DaveMethvin> danheberden speaks the truth, although not in English
[09:05:42] <JohnResig> ok, let's ship today then - I'm assuming that the release notes are a non-event? I'll just dump the results from my script into the blog post, at least

[09:06:34] <amitairos> What's new in 1.6.2?
[09:06:42] <jbrooksuk> Bug fixes :)
[09:06:43] <timmywil> amitairos: just bug fixes
[09:06:53] <danheberden> i haven't seen 1.7 status stuff in the agenda for a few weeks
[09:06:57] <danheberden> JohnResig ^
[09:07:07] <JohnResig> danheberden: we've been working on 1.6.2
[09:07:26] <ajpiano> we should probably check in on stuff next week
[09:07:27] <jaubourg> do we target a 1.6.3 or go straight to 1.7?
[09:07:28] <JohnResig> 1.7 isn't for quite a while yet, so it's a low priority
[09:07:30] <danheberden> JohnResig MOAR JQUERIES - heh, so no need to check on progress?
[09:07:31] <JohnResig> ajpiano: yep
[09:07:37] <jbrooksuk> 1.7 to align with Minecraft ;)
[09:07:44] <danheberden> ya - just thinking so we aren't against a wall come deadline
[09:07:45] <JohnResig> jaubourg: dunno, we'll have to see if there are bugs that need fixing
[09:07:51] <jaubourg> k
[09:08:04] <danheberden> just being the annoying guy poking the big angry bear
[09:08:17] <danheberden> big angry bear == 1.7
[09:08:22] <DaveMethvin> well duke nukem is out so watch for flying pigs
[09:08:23] <timmywil> am i still going to boston mayhaps?
[09:08:35] <DaveMethvin> go to boston!
[09:08:35] <JohnResig> timmywil: hope so, yeah!
[09:08:38] <jbrooksuk> Menstrual bear = 1.7.1
[09:08:44] <JohnResig> ajpiano: what's the vote status?
[09:08:52] <ajpiano> i guess i just have to file a motion thing
[09:09:03] <ajpiano> i will do that now
[09:09:03] <marcofolio> ?? for releasing today, 0 against
[09:09:03] <danheberden> ajpiano can you do that today? times a wastin
[09:09:05] <danheberden> :p
[09:09:08] <DaveMethvin> obtw i may be coming too but think I can piggyback it on some other work so i won't need reimbursement on the airfare
[09:09:20] <JohnResig> ajpiano: awesome, thanks
[09:09:31] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: nice
[09:09:37] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sweet
[09:09:48] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i can budget it and then you can just get not reimbursed? or should i just take it off first
[09:10:03] <ajpiano> marcofolio, seems like everyone for, no one against
[09:10:05] <ajpiano> :)
[09:10:07] <JohnResig> ajpiano: might as well include his food, at least
[09:10:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah i guess it's safest to budget and then i can just not ask for reimbursement
[09:10:19] <ajpiano> JohnResig yea he's in there for the whole shebang
[09:10:22] <ajpiano> ok
[09:10:26] <ajpiano> will send around shortly
[09:10:28] <danheberden> don't forget his 2 beers
[09:10:40] <timmywil> danheberden: >2
[09:10:44] <DaveMethvin> 2 PER DAY
[09:10:46] <danheberden> timmywil inorite
[09:11:27] <JohnResig> ok, I think that's it then - let's try to get 1.6.2 out either today or tomorrow and next week we'll discuss 1.7 status
[09:11:36] <marcofolio> great!
[09:11:37] <DaveMethvin> woo hoo!
