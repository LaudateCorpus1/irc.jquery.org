[11:01:30] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:01:39] <gseguin> hey
[11:01:45] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:01:51] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:01:55] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:02:06] <uGoMobi> I think it's just the 3 of us today
[11:02:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and _|Nix|_ are on vacation
[11:02:24] <gseguin> I don't have much to discuss
[11:02:40] <gseguin> I will make some time to address the CDN zip issue
[11:02:58] <uGoMobi> updates and agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/19W85MQ2P_7arIPsyXMNlx0sBNklpHu7Tav2rkveD4-Y/edit?usp=sharing
[11:03:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: do you want to edit the zip and re send to paul or want me to?
[11:03:22] <gseguin> I started doing it
[11:03:28] <arschmitz> ok cool thank you
[11:03:34] <gseguin> I downloaded the zip from jquerymobile.com
[11:03:47] <gseguin> and will edit it and repackage it
[11:03:54] <arschmitz> perfect thank you
[11:04:11] <gseguin> sorry about that
[11:04:16] <uGoMobi> great
[11:04:26] <uGoMobi> 1.4 alpha 2
[11:04:41] <uGoMobi> last week we decided to do another alpha
[11:04:41] <arschmitz> oh no problem i figured that it was just a mis understanding when i talked to paul based on what you had told me
[11:05:11] <gseguin> yeah it'd be great if I have time to fix the Gruntfile to integrate that change before we do alpha.2
[11:05:25] <gseguin> when do you want to do alpha.2?
[11:05:33] <uGoMobi> yeah let's talk about that
[11:05:42] <uGoMobi> last week we said we aim for today
[11:05:53] <gseguin> oh
[11:05:58] <uGoMobi> I am still working on some panel issues
[11:06:13] <gseguin> though it doesn't really matter because we're not putting it on Google's CDN
[11:06:16] <arschmitz> i dont have any thing critical
[11:06:21] <RWhitbeck> I am lurking while working
[11:06:22] <arschmitz> for 1.4
[11:06:33] <uGoMobi> hi RWhitbeck
[11:06:35] <arschmitz> there are bugs and stuff but those can be post alpha
[11:06:36] <gseguin> and rhyming while lurking
[11:06:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just noticed some issues
[11:06:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure if it has to do with autoinit
[11:07:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: like what?
[11:07:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6044#issuecomment-20351194
[11:07:29] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6044 by teusinkorg (2mon 1w ago): Popup issue with PhoneGap and Android ICS (4.0.x)
[11:07:43] <uGoMobi> if you test the JS Bins in there,you get errors
[11:08:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: does not look related
[11:09:09] <arschmitz> _page is undefined in popup
[11:09:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the issue that I had with calling panel's destroy method in my branch also appear on master
[11:09:33] <arschmitz> i would guess its related to the popup cleanup _|Nix|_ did last week
[11:09:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that seems to be a server vs build thing
[11:09:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[11:09:59] <uGoMobi> anyway, there are some things we need to look into
[11:10:07] <arschmitz> ok
[11:10:21] <uGoMobi> I also want to revert a change we made
[11:10:32] <uGoMobi> option inset for textinput
[11:10:50] <uGoMobi> that was added for filterable + listview
[11:11:06] <uGoMobi> I want to do that with CSS
[11:11:08] <arschmitz> ok
[11:11:27] <uGoMobi> I can do that tomorrow morning European time
[11:11:38] <uGoMobi> and finish panel stuff tonight
[11:12:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have things you want to do before alpha 2?
[11:12:17] <uGoMobi> how about that focusPage change?
[11:12:19] <arschmitz> yeah some minor minor things nothing much
[11:12:34] <uGoMobi> to prevent our jumping API docs
[11:12:36] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:12:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh yeah i would like to do that now that you mention
[11:12:49] <uGoMobi> would be nice
[11:13:23] <uGoMobi> ok looks like we can release tomorrow
[11:13:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: does that work for you?
[11:13:45] <gseguin> yup
[11:13:55] <uGoMobi> great
[11:14:08] <gseguin> like I said it doesn't matter if the Gruntfile is not ready for the CDN thing
[11:14:20] <uGoMobi> when alpha 2 is out we really have to do a lot of API docs and Demo Center updating
[11:14:21] <gseguin> since we don't put the alpha on Google's CDN
[11:14:28] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:14:42] <uGoMobi> I already looked at Theme Roller
[11:15:04] <uGoMobi> that is not going to be easy either to update
[11:15:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you add PR's as agenda item or did I do that?
[11:16:01] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:16:02] <arschmitz> i did
[11:16:11] <uGoMobi> ok go ahead
[11:16:21] <uGoMobi> good item
[11:16:35] <arschmitz> just want to go over the last couple we have open and make some decisions
[11:16:36] <gseguin> Congrats you guys on the clean up in issues and PRs
[11:16:47] <arschmitz> back under 300!
[11:16:47] <uGoMobi> credits go to arschmitz
[11:17:02] <uGoMobi> awesome job on PR review and triage
[11:18:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and I already discussed that we should discuss new PRs and feature requests each week during meeing
[11:18:19] <arschmitz> ok so ones i would like opinions on
[11:18:28] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5751
[11:18:28] <b-ot> arschmitz: Pull request #5751 by peteboere (4mon 4w ago): overridden defaultHomeScroll config value
[11:18:47] <arschmitz> to force a default home scroll value
[11:19:12] <uGoMobi> was this configurable but not anymore?
[11:19:19] <arschmitz> it never was
[11:19:26] <arschmitz> and was never documented
[11:20:07] <arschmitz> its just a variable that exists in the library that someone wants the ability to force a value on
[11:20:07] <uGoMobi> then let's keep it that way
[11:20:27] <arschmitz> sounds good Closed!
[11:21:19] <uGoMobi> we should look into the 1px jump issue though
[11:21:34] <arschmitz> yes but thats a whole different issue
[11:21:40] <uGoMobi> exactly
[11:21:43] <arschmitz> this would cause it on some that dont do it now
[11:21:51] <arschmitz> and fix ones ones that do etc
[11:22:09] <arschmitz> next https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6172
[11:22:09] <b-ot> arschmitz: Pull request #6172 by jacob (3w 2d ago): Add dynamicInitialPage config setting, default off. Allows first jqm page loaded to be dynamically rendered.
[11:22:12] <uGoMobi> yeah, does not make sense to let people set values for this
[11:23:15] <uGoMobi> 6172 is interesting
[11:23:18] <arschmitz> i think this is a good feature request but it a change i dont think we should make right now with out substantial testing and looing into related things like first page cacheing
[11:23:33] <gseguin> why dont they not auto-init ?
[11:23:54] <uGoMobi> makes me think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3249
[11:23:54] <arschmitz> i think its way to late to make this change
[11:23:55] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #3249 by itechnology (19mon 3w ago): Allow first page to be deleted when Dom caching is disabled
[11:23:55] <gseguin> and then call the init when they're ready?
[11:24:28] <arschmitz> gseguin: no idea;
[11:24:53] <gseguin> I don't think this is needed
[11:25:03] <arschmitz> yeah i tend to agree
[11:25:42] <arschmitz> ok so close as not needed dont use autoinit
[11:26:04] <uGoMobi> +1
[11:26:26] <uGoMobi> before you know you have hundreds of options like dynamicInitialPage
[11:26:33] <gseguin> yeah set $.mobile.autoInitializePage to false and then call $.mobile.initializePage when your app is ready
[11:26:42] <arschmitz> yup
[11:26:57] <uGoMobi> first see if it can already be done with current code
[11:27:43] <arschmitz> ok so next https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6236
[11:27:43] <b-ot> arschmitz: Pull request #6236 by JGeeks (1w 3d ago): Transitions: delay  transition to avoid  transition stuck, and keep them...
[11:28:29] <arschmitz> i use ios 5 and have tested this and have not seen it but enough people say they have that it seems to be happening
[11:28:42] <arschmitz> but i dont think im willing to make this change with a timeout
[11:29:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah there was a lot of comments on that ticket last couple of days
[11:29:22] <arschmitz> or at least not with a nonzero one and this is a time out of 1
[11:29:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree, this feels like duct tape
[11:29:38] <gseguin> Looks like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764#issuecomment-22171971 is a better fix
[11:29:39] <b-ot> gseguin: Issue #5764 by Jelmeaux (4mon 3w ago): Slide transition not working properly on iOS
[11:29:55] <gseguin> haven't tested though
[11:30:05] <gseguin> but I'll take anything over a setTimeout
[11:30:23] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:30:24] <arschmitz> yeah i think this is an issue but im not willing to go with a setTimeout
[11:30:31] <uGoMobi> first review logic
[11:30:42] <arschmitz> also i tend to think that if 1 works 0 will
[11:31:01] <arschmitz> and setTimeout 0 is generally fine its just unwinding the stack
[11:31:23] <arschmitz> but i would want to ensure it was needed at all
[11:31:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what we can do is pull it in a branch
[11:31:55] <uGoMobi> and test with 0
[11:32:08] <arschmitz> so close as not the correct solution needs more investigation
[11:32:09] <uGoMobi> and also test the fix mentioned in that comment
[11:32:37] <uGoMobi> we can wait for a moment with that so people see we are looking into the issue
[11:32:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think this just needs more looking into in general befor committing to a fix
[11:33:05] <uGoMobi> I can comment on the ticket that we review the PR and other suggested fix
[11:33:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we should close the PR though because there is almost no way we will actually use the PR
[11:34:05] <arschmitz> but comment to why and comment on ticket
[11:34:38] <gseguin> gotta dash out, I'll see you later on -dev
[11:34:43] <uGoMobi> ok later
[11:34:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok later
[11:34:49] <uGoMobi> ok arschmitz
[11:35:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: one last PR
[11:35:08] <uGoMobi> just want people to know that we look into the issue
[11:35:13] <arschmitz> ofcourse
[11:35:20] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6292
[11:35:20] <b-ot> arschmitz: Pull request #6292 by stforek (2d 5h ago): Collapsible: toggle ui-btn-active class on vmouse events
[11:35:29] <uGoMobi> yeah I looked at that one
[11:35:45] <arschmitz> what did you think?
[11:35:51] <uGoMobi> small issue, but lot of code and event bindings to fix it
[11:36:06] <uGoMobi> just because we only add active state on touch devices
[11:36:52] <arschmitz> hmm
[11:37:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you like the fix?
[11:37:17] <arschmitz> i dont like anything with vmouse ha ha
[11:37:37] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:37:42] <arschmitz> no actually this is not vlick so vmouse is fine outside vclick honestly
[11:37:57] <uGoMobi> but doesn't tap use vclikc?
[11:38:01] <uGoMobi> vclick
[11:38:20] <uGoMobi> oh thats removed
[11:38:23] <uGoMobi> nevermind
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> no it does
[11:38:58] <uGoMobi> yes but the PR replaces tap by vmousedown
[11:39:23] <arschmitz> yes
[11:40:06] <uGoMobi> can't we do something that we only add active state if _handleExpandCollapse is actually called
[11:40:24] <arschmitz> dont see why not
[11:40:59] <uGoMobi> I would prefer to look into that
[11:41:35] <arschmitz> oh i see the reason here
[11:42:01] <arschmitz> its just to make the collapsible "seem" more responsive
[11:42:16] <arschmitz> by adding the state at the soonest possible moment
[11:42:17] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:42:30] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:42:54] <uGoMobi> if we only call it when the handler is called we don't do it at soonest possible moment
[11:42:56] <arschmitz> wait i think this would actually break current behicor
[11:43:34] <arschmitz> i think this need more thought
[11:44:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it would actually barely even happen if we did in handler because its also removed after a just some class toggles
[11:45:09] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:45:23] <uGoMobi> not a good idea
[11:45:31] <uGoMobi> unless our handler is very slow
[11:45:55] <arschmitz> ok so this would be a change in behivor but...
[11:46:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: want to leave the PR open until we come up with something better?
[11:46:13] <arschmitz> shouldnt an open collapsible have some sort of active style while its open
[11:46:17] <arschmitz> to show its open
[11:46:22] <arschmitz> other then just icon
[11:46:42] <uGoMobi> I don't think that is needed
[11:46:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ala http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[11:48:04] <arschmitz> i think this would make more sense then we could apply active state on open
[11:48:07] <arschmitz> and remove on close
[11:48:22] <arschmitz> not active per se but you know what i mean
[11:48:55] <uGoMobi> if the content is shown it is open, that seems clear enough if you ask me
[11:49:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/collapsibles/
[11:49:21] <uGoMobi> except for navbars we use active state to indicate something is going on
[11:49:44] <arschmitz> but if you open and close that one you as a user have no idea thats part of the colapisble
[11:51:57] <uGoMobi> yeah that's true
[11:52:28] <uGoMobi> I prefer to use content theme
[11:52:46] <uGoMobi> even thought about make it have a theme by default
[11:54:56] <arschmitz> yeah i dunno but i think something needs to change to provide feedback
[11:55:10] <uGoMobi> we use high contrast colors for active state because it indicates and action, not sure if I would like that to stay on the screen while I am reading
[11:55:25] <uGoMobi> s/and/an/
[11:56:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: more i think about it i think the content needs a border / background
[11:56:45] <arschmitz> to show it belongs to the heading at all
[11:56:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok let's think about possible solutions and discuss later on -dev
[11:56:45] <arschmitz> ok
[11:56:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I agree with that
[11:56:50] <arschmitz> and i think that does it for PRs
[11:56:55] <uGoMobi> nice!
[11:57:14] <uGoMobi> any questions from the community?
[11:57:50] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev arschmitz
