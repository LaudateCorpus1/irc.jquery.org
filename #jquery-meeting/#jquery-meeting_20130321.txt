[01:52:50] <ththet> hello
[02:59:15] <chetan> hi
[03:00:19] <Guest95190> anyone here
[03:00:27] <Guest95190> <chetan>
[03:00:30] <Guest95190> ?
[03:00:34] <Guest95190> \n
[11:01:17] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:01:26] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile meeting is going down
[11:01:35] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:01:36] <toddmparker> LOOK: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnCqL9bSL0Lqr92yurS51sxNJ0nknsDJFp8ot-jYeFo/edit#heading=h.crg760xoxv4
[11:01:39] <agcolom> Hi :-)
[11:01:41] <toddmparker> sound off
[11:01:45] <uGoMobi> O_O
[11:03:32] <toddmparker> anyone else here? johnbender, gseguin, _|Nix|_, JasonDScott___, arschmitz
[11:03:42] <arschmitz> HI
[11:03:45] <toddmparker> we'll give 'em a minute to hop on
[11:04:59] <agcolom> we're (europe) are still in Winter time, so _|Nix|_ may think the meeting is in 1h?
[11:05:11] <gseguin> hiya
[11:05:20] <toddmparker> maybe. thought he might have adjusted his reminder
[11:05:31] <toddmparker> think we have a quorum
[11:05:52] <toddmparker> so, maintenance release madness. everything must go!
[11:05:53] <toddmparker> 1.1.2 maintenance release went out Tuesday
[11:05:54] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/03/19/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-2/
[11:06:05] <toddmparker> 1.2.1 shipping today
[11:06:06] <toddmparker> Working on final testing, blog post
[11:06:24] <toddmparker> 1.3.1 within the next 10 days
[11:06:38] <toddmparker> one Q there: should we add missing refresh methods for tables
[11:06:42] <toddmparker> I think we should
[11:06:53] <toddmparker> since 1.4 is a long ways off
[11:07:06] <agcolom> sounds good
[11:07:11] <arschmitz> i tend to agree but i think johnbender may have a dissenting oppinion
[11:07:23] <arschmitz> because its technically a new feature
[11:07:34] <arschmitz> was hoping to ask him about this today
[11:07:36] <uGoMobi> panel doesn't have a refresh method either
[11:07:46] <uGoMobi> but probably less urgent
[11:08:00] <arschmitz> we have a lot of missing methods in general on widgets
[11:08:07] <uGoMobi> +1 to fixing table refresh in maintenance release
[11:08:09] <toddmparker> hem, i might want to add panel's too
[11:08:27] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i agree, it is bending the versioning rules
[11:08:35] <toddmparker> but i see it as a bug
[11:08:41] <toddmparker> a bad one at that
[11:08:59] <arschmitz> yeah its not really a "Bug" though it is bad
[11:09:05] <arschmitz> very bad
[11:09:15] <arschmitz> kind of ashamed we put it out this way
[11:09:30] <arschmitz> we should have been on top of it way before beta
[11:09:39] <raju> jquery
[11:09:50] <toddmparker> so let's fix it
[11:09:57] <toddmparker> but i'll talk to johnbender
[11:10:08] <toddmparker> lots of 1.3.1 issues tagged - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=23&page=1&state=open
[11:10:10] <arschmitz> cool
[11:10:23] <johnbender> reading
[11:10:26] <toddmparker> we might want to move most to 1.3.2 and just have a few items to try and fix in the next week
[11:10:27] <raju> let me check
[11:10:45] <uGoMobi> yeah I moved open tickets from 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 to 1.3.1
[11:10:52] <toddmparker> raja - wrong window?
[11:11:08] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: it's additive at least
[11:11:09] <toddmparker> raju: this is a meeting for jQuery Mobile devs
[11:11:24] <toddmparker> johnbender: absolutely
[11:11:52] <toddmparker> think the question is how "wrong" this is version-wise
[11:11:54] <raju> toddmparker: ok
[11:12:28] <johnbender> it doesn't fit with semver
[11:12:38] <toddmparker> I see it as a critical piece of the API that should have been caught so it does more damage to not have it for months than to add it
[11:12:53] <toddmparker> the server gods would not be happy
[11:12:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: doesn't hurt my feelings
[11:13:04] <johnbender> just making the note
[11:13:07] <toddmparker> ^ thanks autocomplete
[11:13:23] <toddmparker> yeah, i totally get that it ain't right
[11:13:42] <arschmitz> yeah its not 100% "right" but i agree with toddmparker its too important to ignore
[11:13:53] <arschmitz> even more so sense we already have a pr to fix it
[11:14:02] <raju> yes
[11:14:04] <uGoMobi> we had a refresh method already https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/table.columntoggle.js#L89
[11:14:13] <uGoMobi> just not the right way
[11:14:19] <uGoMobi> so it's a bug fix :)
[11:14:25] <toddmparker> but I see the spirit of semver being that we won't break APIs on dot releases and we aren't here. so it's not as bad. it technically is a new feature tho
[11:14:43] <toddmparker> heh, uGoMobi found our loophole :p
[11:14:55] <uGoMobi> problem solved.. next
[11:15:04] <arschmitz> lol reflow does not have that though
[11:15:14] <raju> I am agree with toddmparker
[11:15:19] <toddmparker> which brings us to another item - we need to start putting together widget standards for 1.4
[11:15:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: no it's explicit
[11:15:44] <johnbender> you can't introduce new backward compatible functionality in a patch release
[11:15:49] <johnbender> that's reserved for minor version releases
[11:16:00] <toddmparker> johnbender: i know, i know.
[11:16:13] <johnbender> but that doesn't mean we can't depart
[11:16:19] <johnbender> just pointing out that it's pretty clear :)
[11:16:22] <toddmparker> we can always release 1.4 that just has the refresh methods as a new feature
[11:16:35] <johnbender> yep
[11:16:40] <toddmparker> yeah, i know i'm bending rules
[11:17:16] <toddmparker> let's mull this over. i gave us 10 days to get 1.3.1 out so we have some time
[11:18:40] <johnbender> :)
[11:19:02] <toddmparker> johnbender is my conscience
[11:19:07] <toddmparker> i like that
[11:19:26] <johnbender> lolol
[11:19:43] <arschmitz> another little thing on this is that fixing would be totally temp
[11:19:51] <johnbender> that sounds like an entertaining sitcom waiting to happen
[11:19:57] <arschmitz> because both reflow and toggle modes are not actual widget extensions right now
[11:20:16] <arschmitz> and for 1.4 they should be re written as actual extensions
[11:20:20] <toddmparker> we can do a deeper re-factor in 1.4 for sure
[11:20:53] <toddmparker> speaking of 1.4, we had a hangout yesterday to kick off the theming discussion - notes here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l6t1HyDVd7st_7Mj_8r9D2u_HdJRxxKvtnTZyiwhIlA/edit
[11:22:40] <toddmparker> just linked that up to the 1.4 wiki page
[11:22:43] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-planning
[11:22:48] <toddmparker> which needs updating
[11:23:05] <toddmparker> i'd like to do a similar hangout to talk about API/widget stuff
[11:23:17] <toddmparker> do people have time later today or tomorrow to talk?
[11:23:37] <arschmitz> im available whenever but tomorrow would be better
[11:23:55] <toddmparker> definitely need johnbender, gseguin, arschmitz, uGoMobi, and _|Nix|_
[11:24:08] <toddmparker> i can do either
[11:24:24] <toddmparker> tomorrow is surprisingly clear for me
[11:24:26] <uGoMobi> I am available
[11:24:41] <gseguin> can't do tomorrow
[11:24:43] <uGoMobi> let's do tomorrow
[11:24:46] <uGoMobi> ohw
[11:24:52] <gseguin> sorry
[11:24:57] <toddmparker> DAMMIT GSEGUIN
[11:25:16] <toddmparker> later today?
[11:25:25] <gseguin> yes that would work for me
[11:25:33] <uGoMobi> let's make sure _|Nix|_ can make it too
[11:25:52] <toddmparker> true, he should be back online in 35 minutes :)
[11:26:02] <uGoMobi> was about to say that :)
[11:26:04] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:26:06] <toddmparker> timezones.
[11:26:13] <toddmparker> they are hilarious
[11:26:25] <agcolom> we'll be aligned again in 10 days or so...
[11:26:30] <toddmparker> cool
[11:26:47] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm in
[11:26:54] <toddmparker> let's try and meet after this..we can try and raise _|Nix|_
[11:26:54] <gseguin> let's break for 10 days then
[11:27:04] <johnbender> I can do this afternoon too
[11:27:11] <toddmparker> great, sounds like we can all do it today
[11:27:26] <toddmparker> 10 day vacation!
[11:27:41] <uGoMobi> again?
[11:27:58] <toddmparker> heh
[11:28:38] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:28:42] <toddmparker> Victor should popup up on IRC - he's going to be mating accessibility suggestions. he may ask some Q's about how things work, not sure he has a ton of experience with all the ins and outs
[11:28:43] <_|Nix|_> Sorry I'm late!
[11:28:48] <toddmparker> there's _|Nix|_ !
[11:28:57] <_|Nix|_> Are we doing a hangout?
[11:29:04] <gseguin> later today
[11:29:07] <toddmparker> no worries. you have time after this to do some 1.4 planning?
[11:29:07] <uGoMobi> cool we will help him out
[11:29:14] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[11:29:21] <toddmparker> yep, hangout. I'll take notes and update the public wiki.
[11:29:48] <uGoMobi> I will flag Victor's tickets with "accessibility"
[11:30:13] <gseguin> what time did we say?
[11:30:13] <toddmparker> thanks
[11:30:16] <johnbender> getting breakfast so I can eat whilst listening
[11:30:22] <johnbender> (reading, whatever)
[11:30:33] <toddmparker> let's shoot for 30 minted from now?
[11:30:47] <toddmparker> and wrap this on time
[11:30:48] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:30:58] <toddmparker> ok, that's it from me
[11:31:23] <toddmparker> johnbender: want to go?
[11:32:18] <uGoMobi> want me to go while we wait for johnbender ?
[11:32:25] <uGoMobi> I'll be quick
[11:32:46] <toddmparker> sure
[11:32:52] <uGoMobi> worked on preparations for the 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 release
[11:32:53] * johnbender will go next
[11:33:01] <uGoMobi> one note...
[11:33:10] <uGoMobi> don't forget to cherry-pick commits!
[11:33:24] <gseguin> and cherry-pick with `-x`
[11:33:26] <toddmparker> +1
[11:33:53] <uGoMobi> and did some more triage
[11:34:17] <toddmparker> cool. definitely help me winnow down the 1.3.1 list
[11:34:18] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[11:34:22] <toddmparker> thanks
[11:34:26] <uGoMobi> will do
[11:34:30] <toddmparker> johnbender - gogogogo
[11:35:29] <gseguin> johnbender: hurry you're going to get fired
[11:35:45] <johnbender> lol
[11:35:55] <johnbender> very little over here
[11:36:04] <johnbender> I poked around the edges of nav
[11:36:12] <johnbender> what's left in there
[11:36:24] <johnbender> to get a sense for how hard dumping that into a widget will be
[11:36:26] <_|Nix|_> Please have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5775 ...
[11:36:27] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5775 by leen111 (6d 3h ago): popup and data-history="false"
[11:36:34] <johnbender> we did the deploy
[11:36:48] <johnbender> and we talked a bit about lazy parsing
[11:36:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'll check it out
[11:36:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think we need a version of ignoreInitialHashChange for the navigate event as we have now for the navigator.
[11:37:06] <toddmparker> johnbender: great, i think figuring out a plan to make nag more decoupled is a biggie for 1.4
[11:37:48] <toddmparker> nav, not nag. autocorrect is annoying
[11:39:17] <toddmparker> thanks johnbender, sure there will be a lot to look at after our next meeting
[11:39:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: yar
[11:40:03] <toddmparker> agcolom?
[11:40:08] <agcolom> yes!
[11:40:26] <agcolom> no much here either so here it is...
[11:40:28] <agcolom>     Claim success in getting FFOS phones to the Filament group! Big thanks to Brad Lassey from Mozilla
[11:40:28] <agcolom>     triage
[11:40:28] <agcolom>     catching up with updates on the api docs setup
[11:40:28] <agcolom>     had a discussion with Scott Gonzalez regarding collapsible collapse and expand
[11:41:01] <agcolom> and big thanks to the team for helping me get back up to speed recently (yesterday in particular :-) )
[11:41:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5798
[11:41:12] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5798 by uGoMobi (1h 15m ago): Collapsible expand and collapse events
[11:41:20] <toddmparker> great. i'd like your help working with Rwhitbeck and I one the new site too
[11:41:30] <agcolom> yes, saw that! Thanks that's great :-
[11:41:32] <agcolom> :-)
[11:41:42] <Rwhitbeck> you rang?
[11:41:52] <agcolom> sure. I'm starting to breathe again !
[11:42:24] <agcolom> so happy to help!
[11:43:08] <toddmparker> great
[11:43:13] <toddmparker> hi Rwhitbeck
[11:43:26] <Rwhitbeck> hi toddmparker
[11:43:30] <agcolom> so that's it from me... spotted something on the issue that _|Nix|_ brought up regarding the breaking of rangeslider on form reset
[11:43:34] <toddmparker> we should connect on the site stuff…maybe tomorrow?
[11:43:46] <Rwhitbeck> asounds good.
[11:44:13] <agcolom> I can do tomorrow but late in Europe... from 6pm?
[11:44:29] <agcolom> (is that 1pm your time)
[11:44:37] <agcolom> (if you need me)
[11:44:43] <toddmparker> that sounds great for me
[11:44:48] <toddmparker> sure
[11:44:51] <agcolom> no sorry from 7pm
[11:44:57] <agcolom> 2pm for you
[11:45:20] <agcolom> or 1.30pm should be ok
[11:45:35] <Rwhitbeck> 2pm works I think 1pm doesn't
[11:45:45] <agcolom> 2pm your time is good
[11:46:04] <Rwhitbeck> you factored our DST into that conversion ;-)
[11:46:09] <toddmparker> works for me
[11:46:17] <toddmparker> great
[11:46:22] <agcolom> yes ;-)
[11:46:25] <toddmparker> any other news Rwhitbeck
[11:46:38] <toddmparker> (assumed you were done agcolom)
[11:46:48] <agcolom> i am
[11:47:12] <Rwhitbeck> I have a jQuery Mobile training coming up at the jQuery UK conf.  Could use some help promoting it as that isn't selling as well as the other two trainings.   Proceeds go back to the foundation.
[11:47:44] <Rwhitbeck> http://appendto.com/blog/2013/03/jquery-mobile-workshop-jquery-uk/
[11:47:55] <Rwhitbeck> that's all I have at the moment.
[11:47:58] <toddmparker> remind me to RT
[11:48:01] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[11:48:07] <toddmparker> gseguin?
[11:48:19] <gseguin> yup
[11:48:29] <gseguin> not much this week
[11:48:43] <gseguin> Tracked down pending PR authors for CLAs
[11:48:58] <gseguin> Updated Readme.md with new build instructions
[11:49:31] <gseguin> There are talks about automating CLA checking for PR, that would be awesome
[11:49:38] <toddmparker> thanks for the CLA stuff
[11:49:44] <uGoMobi> not sure if everyone saw the message about CLA's on the jQuery Devs Google group
[11:49:46] <toddmparker> that would rule
[11:49:47] <gseguin> I'll keep up with that and will help implement it
[11:49:56] <toddmparker> thank you gseguin
[11:50:14] <gseguin> thanks uGoMobi
[11:50:40] <gseguin> to all, we can't accept PR ( even read it) if there is no CLA on file for the author
[11:51:00] <uGoMobi> http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[11:51:09] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj5JJFjq9rZDdFJucXdGZXlRdVh2SUVUb2hsb0FBYkE#gid=0
[11:51:47] <gseguin> little progress on tests separation
[11:51:58] <gseguin> we still need to figure out what makes some tests unstable
[11:52:04] <gseguin> that's it for me
[11:52:05] <uGoMobi> oops... not sure if I should have paste that last link here :(
[11:52:10] <toddmparker> ghosts in the machine
[11:52:21] <arschmitz> its locked
[11:52:26] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I was going to say so :D
[11:52:27] <toddmparker> not sure uGoMobi - sure it's ok
[11:52:42] <arschmitz> so public cant see anyway
[11:52:48] <_|Nix|_> I'm not too happy about the PR/CLA thing ... I know it's necessary, but man ... does that ever de-motivate me from checking out /any/ PRs :(
[11:52:49] <uGoMobi> ok good
[11:53:50] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: It's better than dealing with IP-trolls
[11:54:24] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[11:54:54] <toddmparker> it's a pain, but needed. lawyers.
[11:55:00] <_|Nix|_> Too bad we don't use GPL ... that makes it pretty clear that any modification is also GPL ...
[11:55:24] <_|Nix|_> But IANAL so ...
[11:55:32] <gseguin> but then there would be no adoption
[11:55:37] <toddmparker> I think it's more about "You represent that the Contributions are Your original works of authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions."
[11:55:50] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah - we'd need to be the Linux kernel ...
[11:56:02] <toddmparker> ya
[11:56:15] <gseguin> anyhow, next?
[11:56:30] <toddmparker> gseguin: you wrapped?
[11:56:36] <gseguin> I did
[11:56:39] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ what's up
[11:56:47] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:56:49] <_|Nix|_> Not much.
[11:57:06] <_|Nix|_> Merged some PRs (unfortunately), and delved into the lazy loading.
[11:57:29] <_|Nix|_> I had an idea about how to do the lazy loading without breaking anything: property accessors.
[11:57:45] <_|Nix|_> I'm trying that, but it's /really/ tricky.
[11:58:04] <_|Nix|_> However, if it worked out, the solution would be confined to $.widget().
[11:58:57] <toddmparker> I think that the best thing to do is wait and see how much we can speed up enhancement by doing...less enhancement
[11:59:18] <arschmitz> +1
[12:00:00] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's probably a much worthier goal.
[12:00:35] <toddmparker> less technically risky imho
[12:00:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, actually, you'd be surprised how low-impact the accessor method it.
[12:00:58] <_|Nix|_> s/it/is/
[12:01:08] <_|Nix|_> It's totally transparent to anyone who uses $.widget.
[12:01:40] <toddmparker> i'd recommend that we try and push this back on them to deliver perf data and such
[12:01:42] <_|Nix|_> But anyway, I'll finish the accessor experiment, because it may end up in a downstream library.
[12:01:47] <toddmparker> doesn't seem like a huge priority
[12:01:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, this is no longer about that PR.
[12:02:01] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[12:02:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think that's fundamentally broken, because it breaks the promise that during mobileinit the library is fully loaded, widgets 'n all.
[12:03:00] <toddmparker> right
[12:04:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: does that address this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2661
[12:04:09] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #2661 by jblas (17mon 1w ago): Framework needs a mobileready event.
[12:04:10] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:05:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Checking ...
[12:06:12] <toddmparker> anyone else need to do an update while we wait for _|Nix|_
[12:06:17] <toddmparker> think that may be it
[12:06:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Isn't the mobileinit event that?
[12:06:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry - I need to look in more depth.
[12:06:48] <arschmitz> me
[12:06:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's what I was thinking (see my comment there)
[12:07:02] <toddmparker> sorry arschmitz!
[12:07:07] <arschmitz> its ok
[12:07:17] <arschmitz> ill be very quick
[12:07:36] <arschmitz> briefly looked at some pr's for table refresh and the lazy load one
[12:08:14] <toddmparker> great. thanks to everyone for digging into PRs, even with the CLA overhead
[12:08:23] <arschmitz> also talked with frequent and he has broken the listview filter out into a filter widget that also works on tables and hes working on selects too
[12:09:00] <arschmitz> i think this is something we should do for 1.4 since listview filter should be made a widget or extension anyway a more generic filter widget would be great
[12:09:37] <arschmitz> i looked at what he has so far and it needs some work but its a great start he i gave him some feed back and he is going to do some more work on this and let us know
[12:09:38] <toddmparker> +1
[12:10:03] <toddmparker> i think the table filter would be cool, esp if it done by just pulling out filter a bit more
[12:10:20] <arschmitz> yeah his filter widget is really simple too
[12:10:44] <arschmitz> so even if we have to clean up and refactor a bit i think we should go that route and use it as a starting point
[12:11:09] <toddmparker> yep
[12:11:22] <toddmparker> ok, think that's it for an update
[12:11:29] <toddmparker> should we wrap?
[12:11:32] <arschmitz> yep
[12:11:36] <toddmparker> any questions from the community?
[12:13:06] <toddmparker> ok, think that's it.
[12:13:09] <toddmparker> Thanks everyone
[12:13:14] <gseguin> see y'all on -dev
