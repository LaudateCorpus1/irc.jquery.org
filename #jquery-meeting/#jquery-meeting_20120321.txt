[09:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:02:15] <paul_irish> hi
[09:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: infrastructure update?
[09:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> We've got servers, but we're still working on a deploy process to get a staging environment for api.jqueryui.com, correct?
[09:03:34] <jzaefferer> woooooooo
[09:03:35] <bot-t> (16 hours 10 mins ago) <Krinkle> tell jzaefferer FYI: Made a big merge of a dozen commits from my fork to jquery/testwarm
[09:05:07] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez correct
[09:05:13] <danheberden> got sidetracked with the conf site
[09:05:45] <danheberden> but it's pretty general - get the ability to setup wordpress, mysql and nginx together/separately  and easily
[09:05:56] <danheberden> then plug what we need where we need it
[09:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> Is Richard in a training this weeks?
[09:06:03] <danheberden> and work on the things like 'what to clone' etc
[09:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll see if we can get everything deployed tomorrow.
[09:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you get a chance to look into the failing tests?
[09:10:34] <jzaefferer> was there a deploy last week?
[09:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> No, there was still more puppet config that needed to happen.
[09:12:08] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:13:54] <jzaefferer> Well, as for the build: `grunt clean` now uses rimraf, that works
[09:14:13] <jzaefferer> adm-zip is getting better, but still not usable
[09:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> What are the problems with adm-zip?
[09:14:38] <jzaefferer> a lot slower and result is compressed, but can't be decompressed
[09:15:28] <jzaefferer> once noglobals is released, there's some migration to do
[09:16:42] <jzaefferer> Hans says "I'll try to have it done by Friday"
[09:17:56] <jzaefferer> The accordion stuff
[09:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I guess that's it.
