[09:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jperrault jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:00:12] <rxaviers> hello all
[09:00:18] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:00:21] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket and PR counts are still on the decline :-)
[09:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> And mikesherov fixed the last 1.11.x regression.
[09:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to do a 1.11.3 release soon.
[09:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> Whenever I'm not slammed with other tasks ;-)
[09:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> We have a good amount of bug fixes that can be cherry-picked to 1-11-stable.
[09:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> And some of them are pretty important fixes.
[09:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything that needs to be discussed for classes?
[09:03:50] <arschmitz> Well probably worth mentioning i added 2 custom assertions to testsuite
[09:03:57] <arschmitz> hasClasses and lacksClasses
[09:04:23] <arschmitz> for testing if elements have ( or dont have ) any number of classes
[09:04:36] <arschmitz> and im updating ALL the tests to use these consistently
[09:04:51] <arschmitz> just about done and will push another update to classes
[09:05:16] <arschmitz> assert.has/lacksClasses( element, classes)
[09:05:31] <arschmitz> and classes is just a spaced separated string of classes
[09:06:11] <arschmitz> this is to finnally settle many hasClass / attr( "class" / is( ".class.class2" )
[09:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:06:54] <arschmitz> and it gives actual usable diff
[09:07:37] <arthurvr> 5 minutes delay, but I’m here :)
[09:07:42] <arschmitz> its actually a really nice improvement in many of the test files
[09:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure.
[09:07:51] <arschmitz> nice and short and clean
[09:08:06] <arschmitz> and dont need to write the messages 1000X
[09:08:18] <arschmitz>  but thats it for classes
[09:08:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anything for button?
[09:08:29] <arschmitz> yes
[09:08:40] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1415/files#r23699949
[09:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> Why isn't this just iterating over the items option?
[09:10:21] <arschmitz> because its not selecting the actual widgets
[09:10:29] <arschmitz> its selecting the buttons for those widgets
[09:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> Have you looked at how buttonset handles this?
[09:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> Because I don't think there's any other correct way to do this.
[09:13:19] <arschmitz> button set does not need to worry about what widget something is
[09:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't matter.
[09:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's just an extension of what it's doing.
[09:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> Why does it matter what widget the child is?
[09:14:18] <arschmitz> need to call a method on it
[09:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> You know that at the time of construction.
[09:14:57] <arschmitz> yes which is saved in the data of the button
[09:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/button.js#L388-L391
[09:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> Inside controlgroup when you're constructing, you already know the widget type as you iterate over the items option.
[09:15:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i dont see how that helps?
[09:15:43] <arschmitz> yes
[09:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> You can very easily store the instances in an object keyed off the type.
[09:15:51] <arschmitz> i do
[09:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> So why do you need to query the DOM?
[09:16:09] <arschmitz> im finding the visible buttons
[09:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> buttons.filter( ":visible" )
[09:16:22] <arschmitz> because i need to call option on the first and last
[09:16:32] <arschmitz> right
[09:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> So why do you need to query the DOM?
[09:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> L157 should just be using the existing data.
[09:17:32] <arschmitz> because they could have added removed buttons
[09:17:34] <arschmitz> this is in refresh
[09:17:54] <arschmitz> so i need to refind any buttons
[09:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> You should be able to calculate that during the construction.
[09:19:01] <arschmitz> what do you mean?
[09:19:25] <arschmitz> oh you mean do it in _callChildMethod()?
[09:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:19:54] <arschmitz> gotcha ok that makes sense
[09:20:11] <arschmitz> i can just ass i add the data to them push them to a collection
[09:20:22] <arschmitz> ok that solves that
[09:20:35] <arschmitz> ass/as
[09:20:37] <arschmitz> lol
[09:20:53] <arschmitz> ok thats all i got then
[09:21:39] <arschmitz> oh still does not answer though
[09:21:44] <arschmitz> if we should allow non children
[09:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> I still have rebasing the datepicker branch on my todo list. I'll be doing that this week.
[09:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> I tried last week, but there was an issue because simulate was moved in master.
[09:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> And since we have a commit that does a complete rewrite, it gets lost.
[09:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> So I just need to do some manual tracking of when things change in the main datepicker files in master that should still be applied.
[09:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss about datepicker?
[09:23:39] <rxaviers> Is the plan for 1.12 having Globalize 1.x ready?
[09:23:55] <rxaviers> and it using it
[09:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> No, that's for 1.13.
[09:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we're going to make the spinner API changes now.
[09:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> But that's currently planned for 1.13, along with datepicker.
[09:25:26] <rxaviers> ok
[09:26:10] <jzaefferer> We don't have enough progress on Globalize 1.0 anyway
[09:26:16] <jzaefferer> While 1.12 is pretty close, I think
[09:26:31] <jzaefferer> Some more TR fixes and the theme update should be done
[09:26:40] <jzaefferer> Which only leaves classes and button
[09:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, just need classes and button, et al.
[09:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> 1.13 should be fairly quick too.
[09:27:14] <arschmitz> Getting there...
[09:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> In terms of a major release.
[09:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> Since we've made a lot of progress on it already.
[09:27:38] <rxaviers> Big things on Globalize are parsing currency and finish test automation.
[09:27:51] <jzaefferer> Still need to handle CSS dependencies in download builder
[09:28:06] <jzaefferer> That might end up the biggest blocked
[09:28:11] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: any idea how long that might take?
[09:28:15] <jzaefferer> *biggest blocker
[09:29:36] <rxaviers> currency parsing about a week. I have no idea of testing automation.
[09:30:51] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I meant the effort for CSS dependencies
[09:31:22] <jzaefferer> Since that's a blocker for 1.12
[09:32:17] <rxaviers> Mm hard to tell. But, it's my next item after landing TR new demos/
[09:32:45] <jzaefferer> okay, would be good to get an estimate once you've looked into it
[09:33:33] <rxaviers> sure, I will let you know
[09:34:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what's that about resizable?
[09:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> So we have `overflow: hidden` on dialogs.
[09:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> A while ago, tj_vantoll and I decided it was safe to remove that.
[09:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes things like autocomplete and datepicker work properly, since they're able to flow out of the dialog box.
[09:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> But then we got a bug report that if you drag a dialog to the right edge of the window, you get a scrollbar.
[09:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> Because the resize handles stick out past the edge of the dialog.
[09:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> This is how resizable has always worked.
[09:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> The handles are positioned partly inside and partly outside, providing a larger hit target.
[09:37:10] <scott_gonzalez> So we have two options:
[09:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Change resizable to not do that, and just make the handles smaller by default.
[09:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Change dialog specifically to change the resize handles.
[09:38:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im not saying we should do this but could you not also add ANOTHER wrapper to dialog
[09:38:32] <arschmitz> and have the handle be fully inside that
[09:38:36] <arschmitz> and set overflow on that
[09:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> Only if we want to make dialog even more complicated by having multiple alsoResize elements.
[09:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> You'd be resizing an inner wrapper which would need to resize the outer wrapper and the content div at the same time.
[09:39:23] <arschmitz> like i said i didnt say we should only that it would solve both problems
[09:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> I had thought about that, but the simultaneous resizing really turned me off to that.
[09:40:25] <arschmitz> or could we some how make dialog stop xpx shy of right edge
[09:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> Especially since for a dialog-specific solution, just changing the handles is much nicer and accomplishes the same thing.
[09:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> No, containment isn't a dialog concern.
[09:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> It's a draggable concern.
[09:40:58] <arschmitz> true
[09:41:22] <arschmitz> yeah i guess changing the handle size is the simpliest option
[09:41:28] <arschmitz> and a smaller handle is not horrible
[09:42:10] <tj_vantoll> How much smaller does it have to be to avoid the problem? Do we know?
[09:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1092/files#diff-2
[09:44:19] <scott_gonzalez> So 3px for the skinnier side handles.
[09:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> And 5px for the bigger se handle.
[09:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> They have to stay small enough to not occlude content/scrollbars.
[09:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> And of course users can change the sizes and locations if they want with a few lines of CSS.
[09:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> But we definitely want the defaults to be usable.
[09:46:29] <tj_vantoll> Seems a bit tough to grab (assuming I put this in correctly): http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/evs4dcpk/
[09:48:26] <tj_vantoll> Also looks like there are some icon image paths broke in http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css per the theme update.
[09:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that should actually be the same as what we have today, right?
[09:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's currently 12px, but 5px is hidden outside.
[09:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> So 7px @ 0 should be exactly the same as 12px @ -5px with overflow: hidden.
[09:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> So that's one thing to consider.
[09:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> We're not making the resize handlers any smaller than they are today for dialogs.
[09:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> So the question is should we change resizable or just dialog.
[09:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog's resize handles won't actually get smaller hit areas.
[09:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> But the CSS will make them technically smaller because we'll be repositioning them to not flow outside the dialog.
[09:53:31] <tj_vantoll> So http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/evs4dcpk/1/
[09:53:48] <tj_vantoll> That's 15x15 but entirely within the dialog.
[09:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but that will kill the scrollbar.
[09:54:43] <tj_vantoll> Sorry I think I'm not following. How far does it have to go in to avoid the scrollbar?
[09:54:57] <scott_gonzalez> Your first fiddle was correct.
[09:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's the exact same positioning as what we have today.
[09:55:35] <tj_vantoll> Just smaller dimensions
[09:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> Right now we have 12px wide, with 7px inside and 5px outside.
[09:55:53] <scott_gonzalez> The 5px outside is ignored right now because we have `overflow: hidden`.
[09:55:59] <arschmitz> but the 5 outside is hidden by overflow right?
[09:56:08] <tj_vantoll> 7x7 feels too small to me
[09:56:11] <arschmitz> so its already 7x7 in practice?
[09:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's already 7x7 today.
[09:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> And has been for years.
[09:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> Effective size
[09:56:36] <tj_vantoll> I see
[09:56:36] <arschmitz> so nothing changes for users
[09:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> Actual size is 12px, but 5px are unusable.
[09:56:43] <arschmitz> other then we fix the scroll bar issue
[09:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> right
[09:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> The scrollbar issue is already fixed.
[09:57:00] <arschmitz> so this seems like the right thing to do with out a doubt to me then
[09:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, the scrollbar on the window.
[09:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you meant the handle covering the scrollbar in the dialog.
[09:57:14] <arschmitz> yes on the window
[09:58:27] <arschmitz> because to users nothing changes so unless there is an open issue about the handle already being to small?
[09:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> So, it sounds like we probably want to keep resizable as is and only change dialog's CSS.
[09:58:42] <arschmitz> but that would still really be a different issue
[09:58:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats what i would do
[09:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> Right, and the opposite issue has come up before years ago.
[09:59:09] <tj_vantoll> Remove overflow: hidden; from .ui-dialog and change the positioning of the handles to move them inside the dialog and make them 7x7.
[10:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/1ed853f7bb9f58af09e55e207534ecb10bcbe286
[10:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that bug took way too long to fix.
[10:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4575
[10:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: correct
[10:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> We'll also need to change the other handles too.
[10:00:54] <tj_vantoll> Yep
[10:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> By default we apply all the handles.
[10:00:58] <tj_vantoll> For http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10543 presumably?
[10:01:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this would fix that ticket.
[10:01:24] <tj_vantoll> I can put a PR together.
[10:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't even look to see if there was a ticket about that.
[10:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks.
[10:01:46] <tj_vantoll> No problem. I feel like I haven't done anything useful in a while.
[10:01:50] <danheberden> agcolom: we doin' this thing?
[10:01:56] <arschmitz> so seems like this is pretty straightforward then
[10:02:04] <arthurvr> danheberden: yes we do :)
[10:02:11] <arschmitz> i think thats are hint to wrap up lol
[10:02:18] <agcolom> ui meeting is not finished...
[10:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> That was the last item on the agenda.
[10:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
[10:02:44] <arthurvr> thanks scott!
[10:02:46] <arthurvr> agcolom: kswedberg: danheberden: AurelioDeRosa: RWitbeck: gnarf: sfrisk:  meeting time!
[10:02:55] <kswedberg> hello
[10:03:01] <AurelioDeRosa> Hello!
[10:03:02] <arthurvr> I forgot people? (if so, sorry)
[10:03:03] <agcolom> agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit
[10:03:10] <arschmitz> Me! lol
[10:03:22] <arthurvr> oh
[10:03:24] <arthurvr> sorry man
[10:03:28] <arthurvr> :-D
[10:03:39] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: ^
[10:03:58] <sfrisk> hello!
[10:04:10] <agcolom> Hello!
[10:04:18] <arthurvr> Hi all! much to discuss today
[10:04:46] <danheberden> First item is regarding the team leadership. I've been the team lead for the past 3 months but the board would like the team lead to be more involved with the day to day work. Anne is a really great communicator and would be awesome at getting things done, so I support the proposal for her to lead the team.
[10:05:07] <danheberden> If anyone objects, let's address those - otherwise we can put a star on this and move on
[10:05:24] <sfrisk> I think Anne is a good choice.
[10:05:29] <kswedberg> +1
[10:05:30] <arthurvr> LGTM :-)
[10:05:32] <arschmitz> +1
[10:05:43] <danheberden> those are terribly formed objections! lol :p
[10:05:43] <sfrisk> +1
[10:05:46] <danheberden> ok, boom done
[10:05:54] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[10:06:07] <RWhitbeck> Oh hi ... you rang?
[10:06:18] <AurelioDeRosa> How we can disagree? :)
[10:07:04] <arthurvr>  I’d say
[10:07:14] <arthurvr> Oops that was for another channel :)
[10:07:26] <agcolom> ok, so next item: Learn site
[10:07:49] <agcolom> things we didn't get a chance to discuss last time
[10:07:51] <agcolom> proposed: in addition to code snippets, we should have the full example in a jsbin to enable users to manipulate the code and enable us to easily update it.
[10:08:04] <agcolom> (where possible)
[10:08:09] <arthurvr> that’s going to be terrible to maintain :-)
[10:08:20] <sfrisk> but useful
[10:08:25] <arthurvr> for sure
[10:08:29] <RWhitbeck> Instead of jsbins how about we push the functionality of the site to run the demo's inline?
[10:08:30] <arschmitz> arthurvr: not really jsbin is going to have an api for auto generating and pushing bins
[10:09:12] <arschmitz> this has actually been in the works to use for ui demos and maybe api for a while
[10:09:14] <agcolom> my thinking behind it was for example when you have an article or tutorial with screenshots...
[10:09:20] <arschmitz> but stalled around the holidays
[10:09:34] <arthurvr> k. Thanks for the info
[10:09:43] <agcolom> and sometimes the UI changes a lot between releases...
[10:09:56] <agcolom> and we do not have the code for the demo...
[10:10:05] <arschmitz> I emailed Remy the creator of jsbin and Kris this morning to get things rolling on that again
[10:10:40] <agcolom> yes, and that would work nicely with the UI proposal also for GSOC
[10:10:48] <danheberden> arschmitz: just to make sure, we can control the source of these examples from our content, yes?
[10:10:58] <arschmitz> danheberden: yes thats the idea
[10:11:03] <danheberden> awesome
[10:11:15] <danheberden> to be able to just fork an example
[10:11:16] <arschmitz> we would keep them in our repos and then the deploy script would push any changes to jsbin
[10:11:19] <danheberden> that would be so baller
[10:11:25] <sfrisk> nice
[10:11:30] <arthurvr> Awesome!
[10:11:34] <agcolom> sounds great!
[10:11:47] <arschmitz> so thats in the works no idea on timeline right now
[10:12:24] <AurelioDeRosa> sounds really good
[10:13:12] <arschmitz> this is more or less how the ui ones already work
[10:13:20] <arschmitz> they get parsed out of the actual ui repo
[10:13:25] <arschmitz> and put into jqueryui.com
[10:13:36] <arschmitz> so now they would just push to jsbin at the same time
[10:13:53] <sfrisk> that would be really awesome for Chassis in the future too
[10:14:02] <arschmitz> yes
[10:14:08] <arschmitz> oh and we will also get custom subdomains
[10:14:17] <arschmitz> like jquerymobile.jsbin.com
[10:14:18] <arschmitz> etc
[10:14:22] <arthurvr> Nice!
[10:14:46] <arschmitz> so we can have like jquery-learn.jsbin.com or something
[10:15:10] <danheberden> kind of like http://emberjs.jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output ?
[10:15:16] <arschmitz> exactly like that
[10:15:19] <danheberden> sweet
[10:15:27] <arschmitz> so we can customize the look
[10:15:33] <arschmitz> and also make the editor use our style guide
[10:15:37] <arschmitz> so tabs vs spaces
[10:16:28] <arschmitz> not style guide but suggest editor config
[10:16:33] <danheberden> sweet, what's next? 'list of articles, etc' ?
[10:16:45] <arthurvr> ”proposed: Create a list of articles/tutorials/video that would be nice to have”
[10:16:59] <danheberden> wasn't there an issue for this?
[10:17:08] <arthurvr> only for the videos
[10:17:32] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/561
[10:18:01] <AurelioDeRosa> Do we have the resource to manage this sections too? I mean in addition to all the other sections...
[10:18:03] <arschmitz> videos are awesome but tend to get out dated more quickly then articles often i feel like so it would require more active curation
[10:18:05] <danheberden> would it make sense to make separate issues for each thing?
[10:18:23] <AurelioDeRosa> Videos, articles, and guides become outdated fast
[10:18:41] <danheberden> it sounds like a plan to maintain said section would be part of this initial investigate's acceptance criteria as well
[10:18:49] <danheberden> *investigation's
[10:18:52] <arschmitz> for videos would it maybe make more sense to point to a youtube channel rather then add it all to learn?
[10:19:10] <AurelioDeRosa> I like the idea of a YouTube channel
[10:19:12] <arschmitz> and just list one ( or several ) channels on a page on learn
[10:19:13] <danheberden> that was discussed for the jquery14.com - just stuffing them all on youtube
[10:19:14] <agcolom> yes, I would think so
[10:19:43] <arthurvr> ya - but content (even videos) should be linked to specifc articles IMHO
[10:19:44] <danheberden> and then anne gets all the ad revenue
[10:19:54] <agcolom> :-)
[10:19:56] <danheberden> and Internet Points™
[10:19:58] <sfrisk> haha, nice
[10:20:05] <arschmitz> seems much easier to deal with / maintain and people are much much less likely to get grouchy over dated videos that way
[10:20:06] <danheberden> (you can cash those in for cool cat pics)
[10:20:19] <danheberden> except: youtube comments
[10:20:41] <gnarf> hey sorry, catching up
[10:20:47] <arschmitz> youtube videos basicly never go away though
[10:20:54] <arschmitz> so people expect them to become dated
[10:21:00] <arschmitz> unlike a curated website
[10:21:06] <danheberden> also they actually have a date
[10:21:19] <agcolom> yes, I was going to say exactly that
[10:22:31] <agcolom> So do we want to have a list of nice to have articles or do we just open one issue if we would like an article that isn't there?
[10:22:44] <arthurvr> I think that’s the best way of handling this
[10:22:46] <agcolom> (I'm thinking option 2 would make more sense?)
[10:23:12] <arthurvr> Then we can keep discussions focussed, so +1
[10:23:14] <AurelioDeRosa> One article at a time might increase a lot the number of issues to catch up
[10:23:24] <gnarf> arschmitz / danheberden / arthurvr : I wrote a "create a jsbin on the fly" script for my slide deck last jqcon - it's pretty easy: http://gnarf.net/scoping-out-scope and view sources
[10:23:36] <agcolom> yes but can be allocated to someone
[10:24:03] <arschmitz> gnarf: is that using their api?
[10:24:21] <arschmitz> i didnt think it was ready yet / pro only last i checked?
[10:24:22] <arthurvr> yes - I think we’re going to end up opening a bunch of issues while forgetting to work on them.
[10:24:34] <arthurvr> Maybe we should have a limit for ourselfs
[10:24:39] <danheberden> would a mix of audit/evaluate-needs of specific areas be useful?
[10:25:07] <agcolom> yes, probably
[10:25:07] <gnarf> arschmitz: search source for jsbinifyCodeBlock
[10:25:14] <danheberden> like someone creates a list for articles that is three parts. a) must have b) nice to have c) won't have
[10:25:19] <gnarf> it just does a post to jsbin and creates one on the fly with the content
[10:26:01] <agcolom> danheberden: that could work.
[10:26:11] <agcolom> what would go in won't have?
[10:26:32] <danheberden> mostly things that are there that should go away, or calling out specifically things found that are like "Awww hell no that'd be a waste of time"
[10:26:40] <agcolom> (too easy or not relevant, i.e. other resource elsewhere?)
[10:26:46] <danheberden> i'm sprinkling my day-job-manager bullshit in here
[10:26:53] <danheberden> so take it all with a grain of salt
[10:27:43] <agcolom> so we could add that to the doc we're using for analysis...
[10:29:07] <agcolom> would that be ok?
[10:29:38] <arthurvr> what doc do you mean? (sorry if I’m missing something)
[10:29:57] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6xhKoSBtoK9Nsc7uqBcVQULqflc7xWZbtsTO7p1fqA/edit#gid=0
[10:30:08] <arthurvr> oh just that one. Perfectly fine
[10:30:57] <danheberden> i have a meeting i have to run to; call me out on anything in the notes you want me to address
[10:31:10] <arthurvr> k. thanks dan!
[10:31:38] <agcolom> Thanks danheberden
[10:32:24] <gnarf> agcolom: do we have an issue open to track the work/link to that spreadsheet?
[10:33:02] <agcolom> gnarf: we do, but it's in the Foundation issue I think
[10:33:07] <arthurvr> Is it something we want to keep internal, or rather have it being public?
[10:33:15] <agcolom> so would make sense to open one. Thanks for pointing out
[10:33:28] <gnarf> I feel its a public/team issue
[10:33:33] <gnarf> no real reason to hide it IMO
[10:33:49] <gnarf> unless someone has one
[10:34:03] <gnarf> also then I can link people to it if they offer to read a few articles :)
[10:34:09] <agcolom> I'm happy being open about it.
[10:34:23] <agcolom> yes, that would be great!
[10:34:42] <arthurvr> I have some n00bs wanting to give us some feedback too. Open issue might be handy
[10:35:04] <agcolom> we should have an email address in the matrix for reviewers then
[10:35:09] <agcolom> maybe? ^
[10:36:10] <arthurvr> Currently I just asked them to send all feedback to my personal email.
[10:36:18] <arschmitz> we would want some way to get ahold of them i think
[10:36:34] <gnarf> agcolom: make it "open for pubilc to comments"
[10:36:47] <arthurvr> ya seems like a good idea
[10:36:49] <agcolom> ok, so I'll add a column for that
[10:36:50] <gnarf> so that we have to add the info given the comment in the goog doc
[10:36:54] <agcolom> gnarf: great idea.
[10:36:56] <gnarf> team can just edit
[10:37:36] <agcolom> yes
[10:37:49] <agcolom> ok to move on?
[10:37:58] <AurelioDeRosa> yep
[10:38:01] <agcolom> Actions from last meeting:
[10:38:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: to work on automating the CLA check, which will manage the label
[10:38:30] <agcolom> I've not spoke to Scott about this... s
[10:38:49] <agcolom> so I'll say ongoing
[10:38:50] <agcolom> ?
[10:38:59] <arthurvr> yup
[10:39:01] <AurelioDeRosa> Can we ping him now to have an update?
[10:39:13] <gnarf> we haven't moved much on it
[10:39:17] <gnarf> the code is pretty much ready
[10:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's on my list. I did not plan to get to it by now.
[10:39:21] <agcolom> that's why I used his nick
[10:39:24] <gnarf> need to setup the infra side
[10:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> It is item #3 on my todo list though.
[10:40:02] <agcolom> yes, not a short term action. I'll just keep it in the agenda so we don't lose it
[10:40:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: when it gets closer to the top remind me and I'll be ready to make the infra part ready
[10:40:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Will do.
[10:41:31] <agcolom> Aurelio to see how we can get more help from the community
[10:41:31] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeiwEtiIitFt1X8Iu1Cu2X0GgwM-MSb4FOOl50oerPY/edit
[10:41:37] <agcolom> next item: ^
[10:41:52] <agcolom> Thanks AurelioDeRosa for the doc.
[10:42:09] <AurelioDeRosa> :)
[10:42:11] <agcolom> would be good if everyone could take a look and add comemnts/edits
[10:42:22] <arthurvr> cc: RWhitbeck too
[10:42:25] <gnarf> AurelioDeRosa: i like the direction this document is going - do you know if ajpiano / DaveMethvin have looked at it yet? I like to think either of them have a great sarcasm/humor we could maybe use to lighten it up and make it sound more fun :)
[10:42:56] <agcolom> gnarf: yes, that's what I was thinking also...
[10:43:20] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: who did you share with...
[10:43:25] <AurelioDeRosa> I don't think DaveMethvin has reviewed the document but I may be wrong
[10:43:51] <ajpiano> is this gonna b e a blog post
[10:43:51] <AurelioDeRosa> The same people of one document you shared with me: you, arthur and the group
[10:44:16] <ajpiano> it's def a good start
[10:44:28] <gnarf> ajpiano: blog would be nice i think
[10:44:45] <agcolom> +1
[10:44:49] <arschmitz> agreed seems like this should be a blog
[10:44:56] <gnarf> and/or tweet :)
[10:44:59] <AurelioDeRosa> yes, the original idea was a blog post that can be shared via Twitter
[10:45:15] <arthurvr> kinda related: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/569
[10:45:16] <arschmitz> gnarf: dont we tweet all our blog posts?
[10:45:20] <gnarf> (yes)
[10:45:27] <agcolom> so action on me to ask Dave to take a look?
[10:45:38] <gnarf> but the 140 char version of a blog post title is like ajpiano specailty :)
[10:45:55] <AurelioDeRosa> I think so, agcolom
[10:46:21] <arthurvr> About that issue I linked to, might be worth it to have the long-term plans explained in there too.
[10:46:48] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: if you are around, could you please take a look at Aurelio's doc? (we're looking at creating a blog post to get contributors' help with learn and other sites)
[10:47:00] <DaveMethvin> yep, looking now
[10:47:00] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[10:47:12] <agcolom> sorry... I keep disconnecting!
[10:47:13] <agcolom> Thanks Dave
[10:48:23] <arthurvr> then to move on I think?
[10:48:40] <agcolom> Dan to investigate whether BV could donate rating services
[10:48:44] <AurelioDeRosa> yes
[10:49:05] <agcolom> Dan said Outcome, yes, if we want it we can have it. A little more red-tape to work through on the BV end.
[10:50:14] <DaveMethvin> agcolom: lgtm, agree with comments already there, we want to say jQuery Foundation
[10:50:18] <agcolom>  so there may be more people that Dan needs to speak to but good progres so far
[10:50:50] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: Thanks. We'll take that into consideration
[10:51:32] <agcolom> Repos at healthy cadence:
[10:51:32] <agcolom> We aim to have less than 5 issues or be closing more issues than we open on all content-related repos
[10:51:33] <agcolom> Tracking (open issues + open PRs) at https://coloma.users.ecs.westminster.ac.uk/jqueryStats/contentIssues.php
[10:51:34] <agcolom> proposed: Produce biweekly reports at Content meeting and report at following EC meeting
[10:51:55] <agcolom> makes sense?
[10:51:58] <RWhitbeck> Back to that doc on encouraging contributors.  I think it would be awesome if we can use that as a script to an awesome commercial size video and then blog, tweet, smoke signal it out.  It'll be easy to point to as well when we need to recruit again
[10:52:50] <AurelioDeRosa> I like the idea RWhitbeck :)
[10:52:54] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: +1
[10:52:57] <arthurvr> +1
[10:53:12] <agcolom> is that something you could help with as well RWhitbeck?
[10:53:21] <AurelioDeRosa> In regard of the issue, I think we're doing really well
[10:53:25] <RWhitbeck> potentially.
[10:54:10] <AurelioDeRosa> The number is going down and we've other issues ready to be closed as I discussed earlier with arthurvr
[10:54:28] <arthurvr> Yah - we’re doing good :)
[10:54:33] <arthurvr> API site is a huge one tho
[10:54:46] <agcolom> perfect!
[10:54:48] <arthurvr> but many issues in there are like, really easy, so might go down quick
[10:55:08] <arthurvr> thanks for all the help in there btw, AurelioDeRosa
[10:55:20] <agcolom> So I'll continue to report at Executive Committee about progress
[10:55:39] <arthurvr> I don’t know what you guys generally talk about at the EC, but seems like a good idea
[10:55:50] <agcolom> And 1st agenda item is triage count
[10:55:52] <AurelioDeRosa> cool
[10:56:20] <agcolom> Finally GSOC
[10:56:34] <arthurvr> yup - kinda has a deadline so important to discuss
[10:56:46] <arthurvr> We have 2 suggestions:
[10:56:50] <agcolom> arthur did you want to talk about that?
[10:56:50] <agcolom> We have 2 projects proposed:
[10:56:50] <agcolom> Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites  (as discussed 2 weeks ago)
[10:57:20] <agcolom> and Issue Tracking system https://github.com/jquery/content/issues/4
[10:58:00] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015---Ideas-List
[10:58:11] <arthurvr> we will need to have this proposals
[10:58:20] <arthurvr> and decide on mentors
[10:58:21] <agcolom> for the 1st one, we have arthurvr and myself for mentors
[10:58:32] <AurelioDeRosa> The first link is broken it seems
[10:58:43] <arthurvr> I wanne be like… the backup, but would like somebody else to really be the mentor
[10:59:35] <arthurvr> As a student, it just seems weird to be montored by a boy 10 year younger then yourself :)
[10:59:36] <agcolom> sorry I was disconnected again!
[10:59:41] * arthurvr is 14, btw
[11:00:12] <agcolom> which is awesome!
[11:00:21] <arthurvr> agcolom: you missed my comments?
[11:00:57] <agcolom> the one line about weird being monitored by someone 10y younger?
[11:01:12] <arthurvr> and this: : I wanne be like… the backup, but would like somebody else to really be the mentor
[11:01:40] <agcolom> arthurvr: I'm happy being the mentor then...
[11:01:44] <agcolom> Anyone else interested?
[11:01:56] <arthurvr> k. I’ll help in any way I can.
[11:02:08] <arthurvr> Btw, agcolom, are you in the skype group for gsoc?
[11:02:13] <AurelioDeRosa> Sorry but I'm sure I'm missing something about this issue
[11:02:23] <agcolom> arthurvr: yes
[11:02:29] <arthurvr> k then.
[11:02:33] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa: what are you missing?
[11:02:45] <AurelioDeRosa> GSOC
[11:02:46] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: we've got a proposal for Google Summer of Code Projects
[11:03:03] <agcolom> and we've prposed 2 projects
[11:03:06] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa: or do you mean the broken link? it’s a private repo :-(
[11:03:17] * arthurvr hates private repos with a passion
[11:03:34] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: sorry, we 're going to make that repo public
[11:03:49] <AurelioDeRosa> I meant the question about GSOC, I'm not informed about that
[11:03:55] <AurelioDeRosa> It's probably because I'm new here :)
[11:04:18] <arthurvr> the jQ foundation wants to apply for https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1
[11:04:24] <agcolom> It's coming from the Foundation
[11:04:50] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you for the links
[11:04:59] <AurelioDeRosa> If there is any way I can help, I'd like to :)
[11:05:04] <agcolom> so as a foundation we're proposing a range of projects... we're working on the proposal
[11:05:18] <arthurvr> Well then, I think we’re ready to round?
[11:05:32] <arthurvr> agcolom: are you going to put up the minutes?
[11:05:41] <agcolom> arthurvr: yes
[11:05:46] <arthurvr> perfect. thanks
[11:05:49] <agcolom> this eve.
[11:05:54] <agcolom> After dinner!
[11:06:01] <agcolom> (I nearly burnt it!)
[11:06:11] <agcolom> Thanks everyone!
[11:06:29] <arthurvr> thanks agcolom! The jquery.org/team page has to be updated too
[11:06:31] <arthurvr> In case you forgot
[11:06:36] <AurelioDeRosa> Ok people
[11:06:41] <arthurvr> Bye!
[11:06:58] <AurelioDeRosa> It's has been nice to chat with you
[11:07:02] <AurelioDeRosa> see you at the next meeting
[11:07:12] <agcolom> Could someone close the channel?
[11:07:17] <agcolom> thanks everyone...
[11:07:51] <AurelioDeRosa> Bye
