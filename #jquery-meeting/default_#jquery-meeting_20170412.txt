[12:04:15] <fnagel> hi
[12:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> hey fnagel
[12:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with your PRs
[12:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> Calendar: Add working year / month select demo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1803
[12:05:55] <fnagel> yes, not that much time
[12:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with the big thing.
[12:06:34] * scott_gonzalez I'd like this demo to use an extension that adds options rather than create a new widget.
[12:06:59] <fnagel> SOunds good
[12:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> Weird, did that not show up as a normal message for others?
[12:07:21] <fnagel> is there an example on how to do this regarding folder structure, etc.?
[12:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few reasons for this.
[12:07:37] <fnagel> What is "that"?
[12:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> You can leave it inline in the demo
[12:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> Just change `"custom.calendarWithSelect"` to `"ui.calendar"`.
[12:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> "that" being my previous message
[12:08:30] * scott_gonzalez test
[12:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> ^ It showed up like that for me.
[12:09:04] <fnagel> There are there stars (***) in front of your name but I can see you wrote "test"
[12:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> But I had just sent a regular message.
[12:09:15] <fnagel> No idea
[12:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[12:09:20] <fnagel> I'm not really into IRC
[12:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, back to the extension :-)
[12:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> The reasons being:
[12:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> This is just additional functionality, not really a new widget.
[12:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> I suspect a lot of users will copy/paste this if we don't end up merging into the base widget eventually, and it will be much nicer to have those users actually using the normal widget names.
[12:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> Creating a new widget will just cause confusion for anyone using datepicker that wants this functionality.
[12:10:55] <fnagel> Sounds reasonable
[12:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> Should be an easy update.
[12:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> The more technical update is the locale specific ordering for month and year.
[12:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> Does the base widget handle this already?
[12:11:56] <fnagel> yes, no issue at all, I just followed what we did for selctmenu custom renderer
[12:12:13] <fnagel> yes, but this seems more like an issue with the actual calendar code
[12:12:37] <fnagel> that part is copied straight from the base widget
[12:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe the calendar itself should expose methods for rendering month and year and handle the placement on its won.
[12:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> *own
[12:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> So don't expose `_buildTitle()` as an extension point.
[12:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> Keep that private and have it delegate out to two other methods.
[12:13:19] <fnagel> good idea as I must confess that what I'Ve came up with is not pretty code, right
[12:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of which, do we have a list of the extension points?
[12:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> Or is that still TBD?
[12:13:34] <fnagel> Nope
[12:13:52] <fnagel> thats more like documentation right?
[12:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's for api.jqueryui.com.
[12:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> Just wondering if we had a list of the methods yet, not necessarily the actual docs for those methods.
[12:14:35] <fnagel> Any idea how to figure out the sorting for year and month?
[12:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> If not, that's fine, we'll get to it when we get to the rest of the docs.
[12:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> You mean whether they should be increasing or decreasing?
[12:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you mean which is displayed first.
[12:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> Is that not exposed in CLDR?
[12:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad awayrxaviers isn't around.
[12:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> He'd probably know off the top of his head.
[12:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if I can find anything obvious in the CLDR files.
[12:16:12] <fnagel> nice, thanks scott_gonzalez
[12:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing is sticking out to me, and parsing one of the date formats like `yyyyM` seems sketchy.
[12:19:17] <fnagel> I will ask awayrxaviers in the PR
[12:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[12:20:41] <fnagel> I will try to come up with something too. Glaoblize docs are not that bad...
[12:20:58] <fnagel> Shall we speak about a11y / Jon?
[12:21:03] <fnagel> Did you notice https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1802#issuecomment-293186268
[12:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> If we can't figure it, we'll just leave what you have.
[12:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Pure insanity: Some calendars have leap MONTHS!
[12:21:16] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> There doesn't seem to be anyone else around to figure out who can join that call.
[12:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'll send an email to the team to see who's interested.
[12:22:58] <fnagel> soudns good
[12:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> Did you want to discuss this comment at all? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1803#discussion_r110891347
[12:23:17] <fnagel> When there is a date I will try to join
[12:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> Just thinking about how random users would be able to build an extension like this and have confidence that we won't break it in the future.
[12:24:04] <fnagel> this.gridId is similar to this.viewDate
[12:24:12] <fnagel> needed for multipleMonth functionality
[12:24:31] <fnagel> There is that "// TODO: Shouldn't we pass date as a parameter to build* fns" comment in _buildMultiplePicker
[12:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe just add an extension point for accessing those?
[12:24:47] <fnagel> *might* be a solution
[12:25:04] <fnagel> Getter methods?
[12:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> That would solve it too.
[12:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, getters and setters where needed.
[12:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> Because we can document methods.
[12:26:53] <fnagel> Ok, I add this to the wiki todo list and prepare a PR soon
[12:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss for calendar/datepicker today?
[12:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. Thanks.
[12:27:30] <fnagel> Did you read Jons proposed changes in the wiki comment?
[12:27:46] <scott_gonzalez> I did, but by now I forget what they were :-P
[12:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, right, most of the comments seemed sane.
[12:28:30] <scott_gonzalez> The live region for the month was surprising to me.
[12:28:51] <fnagel> "Button should be getting keyboard focus in grid (e.g. then remove aria-labeling on GRIDCELL)" is a big one
[12:29:06] <fnagel> changes all our keyboard control concept
[12:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> Though reading it again, is he actually talking about the title?
[12:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I thought keyboard focus was supposed to stay in one place and we just manage a fake focus.
[12:30:09] <fnagel> Not sure what is meant by "the month" -- I guess it's the title
[12:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> Moving focus around and keeping the datepicker open when the input blurs, not showing the datepicker agains when it receives focus after selecting a date, etc. is a big change.
[12:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> A live region on the title would make sense to me.
[12:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> At first I thought he meant the actual rendered calendar and that seems really odd to me.
[12:31:16] <fnagel> yes, live region would make sense
[12:32:06] <fnagel> most are easy to do, but the focus one is worth to discuss
[12:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure that'll be a major part of the discussion.
[12:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, moving on...
[12:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> I've had this one line PR open for a month: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1800
[12:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> Want to review it now? :-)
[12:35:29] <fnagel> Done
[12:35:59] <fnagel> Anything else? I need to help my girlfriend paint the walls :-D
[12:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> I think we're good.
[12:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll catch up with arschmitz about remaining items.
[12:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. Good luck with your move.
[12:39:05] <fnagel> thanks!
[12:39:18] <fnagel> I will try to join the meetings anyway
[12:39:53] <fnagel> ahh one last question: should I ask Jon to start updating the wiki a11y specs? Would be good to have something more detailed to talk about, right?
[12:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> sure
