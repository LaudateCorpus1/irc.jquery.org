[11:00:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: cgack: lisa_deluca: sfrisk: gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot: Meeting Time
[11:00:22] * gabriel_schulhof waves
[11:00:24] <agcolom> hello :-)
[11:00:26] <cgack> howdy
[11:00:40] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:02:27] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=587091686
[11:03:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Should I get rid of those bug references at the bottom? They've all been handled via PRs.
[11:03:32] <arschmitz> yes
[11:04:36] <sfrisk> allo!
[11:04:55] <arschmitz> Ok lets start with 1.5
[11:05:07] <arschmitz> all updates from ui have landed
[11:05:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Queue action sequence music
[11:05:38] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez:  is working through his first full review of classes right now and has not asked me to change the whole thing yet
[11:05:42] <arschmitz> so we might be good
[11:05:49] <arschmitz> lol
[11:06:06] <gabriel_schulhof> The API should at least not wobble too much anymore, right?
[11:06:22] <arschmitz> assuming he does not ask me to re write whole thing again
[11:06:27] <cgack> :)
[11:06:35] <arschmitz> i have already threatened to drive to PA though
[11:06:58] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:07:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cgack: so you should be good to go ahead and update your classes pr's
[11:07:24] <gabriel_schulhof> /o
[11:07:37] <cgack> rock on
[11:07:48] <arschmitz> Lets make these #1 priority
[11:08:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I'd like to fix the tests first ...
[11:08:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats related so yes
[11:08:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Then. we should be able to rebase onto ui-1-12-tests and keep things eco-friendly.
[11:09:13] <gabriel_schulhof> ... while naturally covering anything new that we add, I'm hoping.
[11:09:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: meh
[11:10:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ui-1-12 is going to continue to need rebases
[11:10:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Onto what?
[11:10:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: any time its updated with master will likely cause conflicts
[11:11:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess I have a few fixes in master since they've diverged.
[11:11:10] <arschmitz> also its very likely things will come up that need to be fixed that should be squashed
[11:11:20] <arschmitz> this is not master it can change
[11:11:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Let's just make sure we don't clobber each other's changes.
[11:11:50] <gabriel_schulhof> That's the problem with rebase and push -f.
[11:11:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im happy to do rebases for people
[11:12:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup but in this case we really cant avoid it
[11:12:13] <arschmitz> thats why i pushed your test branch
[11:12:18] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. So, let's all do PRs onto ui-1-12.
[11:12:26] <arschmitz> it had 5 out of 18 commits conflicted
[11:12:36] <arschmitz> yes that will avoid much of the pain thats what they all should have been
[11:12:41] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and then you rebase, just like you did with ui-1-12-test-fixes
[11:12:45] <arschmitz> *15 our of 18
[11:12:46] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: weren't we already doing that?
[11:12:58] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no most prs were master including yours
[11:13:03] <arschmitz> not ui-1-12
[11:13:17] <jasperdegroot> hmm
[11:13:21] <arschmitz> you need to edit it when you do the pr to start
[11:13:36] <arschmitz> you cant change it after the fact with out making a new pr
[11:13:47] <jasperdegroot> must have made a mistake when creating the new PR :/
[11:13:49] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Our PRs require the new widget factory so we have no choice but to base off of ui-1-12.
[11:13:55] <arschmitz> its ok
[11:13:58] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:14:06] <arschmitz> ill happily rebase for people if they have bad conflicts
[11:14:28] <arschmitz> i fixed gabriel_schulhof which had all but 3 of 18 prs with conflicts lol
[11:14:36] <arschmitz> commits not prs
[11:14:54] <arschmitz> im used to it with all the different classes button stuff now
[11:14:59] <gabriel_schulhof> TBH, I think I'll ditch all my old branches and basically start from scratch. I'll keep references to them for inspiration at most, but I won't use any of the changes, I don't think.
[11:15:09] <arschmitz> i would
[11:15:24] <arschmitz> i can tell you i was not able to re use anything in ui
[11:15:24] <cgack> you would start from scratch?
[11:15:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait, what?! You rebased all my classes PRs?
[11:15:27] <arschmitz> from the old to new
[11:15:30] <arschmitz> no
[11:15:35] <arschmitz> commits not prs
[11:15:41] <arschmitz> on tests branch
[11:15:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, yeah, that. OK.
[11:15:48] <gabriel_schulhof> *whew*
[11:16:02] <arschmitz> i had to to test it
[11:16:06] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Yeah, because the API is totally different.
[11:16:20] <arschmitz> and i figured id save you the pain since it was already done
[11:16:39] <arschmitz> and cgack yes you can use it as a guide
[11:16:47] <arschmitz> but basicly your better off starting new
[11:16:49] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: I mean, it's a judgement call, but basically I'd have to cherry-pick each commit and make modifications, so I might as well just look at the commit and make the changes by hand.
[11:17:00] <cgack> gabriel_schulhof arschmitz probably a good call
[11:17:51] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Your existing branches will show you where in the widget the classes option comes into play, but you have to write new code at those points.
[11:17:54] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: everything from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7846 (1.5-button-css-and-demos branch) landed in ui-1-12, right?
[11:18:05] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup
[11:18:11] <jasperdegroot> ok thanks
[11:18:31] <arschmitz> is everyone ok with me closing all existing classes prs"
[11:18:34] <jasperdegroot> I will close that PR and delete the branch, and create a new branch/PR for updating demos
[11:18:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Absolutely.
[11:18:49] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i did some of the demo updates already
[11:18:51] <jasperdegroot> I think I just answered :)
[11:18:55] <arschmitz> but there are still a lot more of course
[11:19:01] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ah great
[11:19:15] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, I will continue to work on that
[11:19:36] <cgack> arschmitz: close at will
[11:20:18] <arschmitz> i think thats all of them
[11:21:47] <arschmitz> We have recieved a few responses about rtl
[11:22:48] <agcolom> for rtl I have a lot of students that can help with testing
[11:23:28] <gabriel_schulhof> The problem is for that we need localization into an RTL language, right?
[11:23:48] <gabriel_schulhof> We can't just RTL in English ...
[11:24:17] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't know of any RTL-written language that uses the Latin alphabet :)
[11:24:24] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I am not sure, maybe just adding dir="rtl" to the html tag already reveals many problems
[11:24:52] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: OK.
[11:25:36] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: http://jsbin.com/toloduhune/1/edit
[11:25:56] <jasperdegroot> that seems to work
[11:25:59] <arschmitz> yeah much of this is handeled in the browser
[11:26:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[11:26:15] <arschmitz> but there are cettain things that we do with js that need adjustment
[11:26:30] <arschmitz> there are also common layouts that break in rtl
[11:26:37] <arschmitz> due to bad css
[11:26:43] <gabriel_schulhof> In CSS, left means left, even in RTL, right? Like, padding-left.
[11:26:48] <arschmitz> like using negative text indent
[11:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> Let's not get into details here.
[11:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> There will be dedicated discussions with people who actually know what they're talking about.
[11:27:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: agreed
[11:27:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, true.
[11:28:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: you mentioned students? like students that actually speak rtl languages?
[11:28:40] <agcolom> yes
[11:28:51] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats very very good to know
[11:28:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[11:29:05] <agcolom> I've mentioned it to some of them and they're happy to help with testing
[11:29:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats awesome!!!
[11:29:27] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yup, I've already talked to agcolom about this.
[11:29:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh ok great
[11:29:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Super-cool!
[11:30:10] <arschmitz> so no updates on auto init this week
[11:30:34] <arschmitz> iv been busy with classes and pr reviews and button .....
[11:31:30] <arschmitz> Pointer events polyfill now has its own  channel
[11:31:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: is temporary lead to get things going
[11:32:48] <arschmitz> I think unless any one objects we wil stop covering this and chassis in this meeting since those are both up and running now
[11:33:04] <arschmitz> execpt where there is something that directly relates
[11:33:30] <jasperdegroot> yeah, makes sense
[11:33:49] <cgack> arschmitz: what is the channel?
[11:33:55] <arschmitz> #pep
[11:34:09] <cgack> thanks
[11:34:23] <jasperdegroot> pep talk channel :)
[11:34:24] <gabriel_schulhof> That's cool. I guess we'll be hearing from both soon enough.
[11:35:20] <arschmitz> and that brings us to perf bug?
[11:36:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[11:36:10] <gabriel_schulhof> It's about running $( ":focus" ) during page change.
[11:36:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Is that so bad?
[11:36:17] <gabriel_schulhof> DO we need it?
[11:36:43] <arschmitz> why are we not just doing document.activeElement?
[11:36:54] <gabriel_schulhof> We are, but it falls back.
[11:37:11] <gabriel_schulhof> So, one of the questions I pose in that comment is how often we actually fall back to $( ":focus" )
[11:37:14] <arschmitz> why where does that fail?
[11:37:25] <gabriel_schulhof> No idea.
[11:37:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: are you aware of anywhere that will fail?
[11:38:18] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/841db13f9ca68e622d4122954089cc4a560657c1/js/widgets/pagecontainer.js#L1038-L1053
[11:38:29] <scott_gonzalez> By falling back, do you mean that document.activeElement is null?
[11:38:40] <arschmitz> no
[11:38:57] <scott_gonzalez> So what does "it falls back" mean?
[11:39:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Actually, yes  ... null or equal to body
[11:39:20] <gabriel_schulhof> If either of those conditions is true, it uses $( ":focus" )
[11:39:35] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and blurs the result
[11:39:54] <gabriel_schulhof> This is actually bad, because $( ":focus" ) could also return body, right?
[11:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt that documen.activeElement is the body and some other element has focus.
[11:40:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ... in which case it'd background the tab on IE, right?
[11:41:07] <arschmitz> what i want to know is where docuent.activeElement will be null or undefined but :focus will find an input textarea or select still
[11:41:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no all of those :focus are on specific element types
[11:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> Possibly in IE9.
[11:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> This is what I'm aware of: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/85fc5878b3c6af73f42d61eedf73013e7faae408
[11:43:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Dang! That's bad!
[11:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> And here's a more documented version that addresses what gabriel_schulhof mentioned about IE hiding the tab: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/c89cb74893c4f99d6163e29110c36d9e02dc7df1/ui/dialog.js#L204-L218
[11:43:15] <gabriel_schulhof> We use document.activeElement in some places.
[11:43:34] <arschmitz> that still does not like it would relate to why we need to check :focus after
[11:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you should ever need to fall back to :focus.
[11:44:00] <arschmitz> thats what im saying i dont see where this would matter or do anything
[11:44:24] <arschmitz> though we clearly need to be more careful about activeElement
[11:44:31] <arschmitz> as i use that in button in ui too :/
[11:44:40] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Then I can make a PR that fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1560 by getting rid of $( ":focus" ). I'll acquire document.activeElement safely and avoid blurring things that break IE.
[11:44:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and in popup.
[11:45:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so i would say yes this is a perf issue since it is expensive and as far as i can tell does nothing
[11:45:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Popup already avoids window and body but doesn't try {}
[11:46:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, it's probably not a perf issue at all, because it never falls back on any mobile platform. Nevertheless, we should remove the possibility that it does fall back.
[11:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> :focus is just going to check against document.activeElement anyway.
[11:46:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah lets get this cleaned up
[11:46:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. I'm on it.
[11:46:54] <jasperdegroot> I think the code already changed when arschmitz moved it to pagecontainer widget
[11:46:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Priority https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2
[11:47:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Gah!
[11:47:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Priority (#2)
[11:47:09] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we're hitting native qSA, then who knows what it does.
[11:47:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've also assigned a few issues to you, because they require your comment. They're long-standing issues.
[11:48:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, whenever you get some time and feel nostalgic :)
[11:48:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sure
[11:48:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I guess you've already addressed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1560. That leaves two: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4022 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5069 ... take your time.
[11:50:16] <arschmitz> 4022
[11:50:28] <arschmitz> is about pulling transitions out of page container
[11:51:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I thought it was about making transitions available on their own.
[11:51:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and that's possible already: http://jsbin.com/zexic/1
[11:51:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: your including pagecontiner?
[11:51:47] <gabriel_schulhof> No.
[11:51:49] <arschmitz> how is it pulled out
[11:51:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Just transitions.
[11:51:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: AMD.
[11:51:59] <arschmitz> <script src="http://cdn.rawgit.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/master/js/widgets/pagecontainer.js"></script>
[11:52:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, crap!
[11:52:13] <gabriel_schulhof> I just ran git --module
[11:52:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Oops!
[11:52:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Need to look into that
[11:52:25] <gabriel_schulhof> In that case, it's not a done deal.
[11:52:40] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess it needed a second set of eyes - well, there we go :)
[11:52:44] <arschmitz> there is a ton of transition logic in page container
[11:52:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, but that's fine.
[11:53:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: transitions must not pull pagecontainer.
[11:53:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The other way around is OK.
[11:53:16] <arschmitz> right but that logic should not be in page container
[11:53:20] <arschmitz> is the point of the issue
[11:53:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, right. Now I get it.
[11:53:58] <gabriel_schulhof> I thought transitions didn't depend on pagecontainer at all, but I just generated script and CSS tags based on grunt output.
[11:54:01] <arschmitz> all page continaier should do out of the box is display none one and block the other basicly
[11:54:13] <arschmitz> it should not handle any sort of transition
[11:54:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... you're talking about the opposite direction.
[11:55:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm talking about being able to use transitions without having to include pagecontainer.
[11:55:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Is that not what's desired?
[11:55:23] <arschmitz> partially
[11:55:35] <arschmitz> but not really
[11:55:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Or are both directions desired? i.e., pagecontainer falls back to not using transitions, and transitions do not require pagecontainer to work.
[11:55:50] <arschmitz> correct
[11:55:56] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Gotcha.
[11:56:12] <arschmitz> pagecontainer = history management
[11:56:16] <arschmitz> nothing to do with trnsitions
[11:56:24] <gabriel_schulhof> So, basically, I can if ( $.mobile.defaultTransitionHandler ) { /* do the transition thing */ } else { /* hide old show new */ }
[11:56:36] <arschmitz> right
[11:56:40] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:56:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool.
[11:56:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also to do transitions
[11:57:03] <arschmitz> in jsbin like that
[11:57:13] <arschmitz> you need to set an overflow: none container
[11:57:18] <arschmitz> or they dont look right at all lol
[11:57:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. I wasn't too concerned with the styling. Just wanted to show that a custom build would work.
[11:57:49] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it does, except that it pulls pagecontainer :)
[11:58:12] <arschmitz> well and thats only part of the issue :-) but now that thats clear
[11:58:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: though im not sure this is worth working on
[11:58:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: because we want to switch to js transitions
[11:58:44] <arschmitz> which are completely totally different logic
[11:59:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You know what? It may be worth rendering pagecontainer transition support as a pagecontainer extension, because then we can just drop in js transitions.
[11:59:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that would make more sense
[12:00:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and actually, the pagecontainer's transition() function is a good extension point.
[12:00:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. I'm clear on the matter now.
[12:00:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Thanks!
[12:00:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok execlent
[12:01:10] <arschmitz> 5069 ill have to read though
[12:01:24] <arschmitz> does any one have anything else?
[12:02:34] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm good ...
[12:12:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[12:12:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: May I close the channel?
