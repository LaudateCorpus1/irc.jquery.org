[11:00:19] <gseguin> hiya
[11:00:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot: agcolom: cgack: ldeluca: gseguin: Meeting Time
[11:00:38] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:00:40] <cgack> howdy
[11:00:41] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: you too!
[11:00:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Yo ho ho and a barrel of grog!
[11:00:53] <arschmitz> The list is growing :-)
[11:00:56] <ldeluca> hola
[11:00:57] <jperrault> mmm. grog.
[11:01:08] <ianmaffett> hello
[11:01:11] <gseguin> wow! full house!
[11:01:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Niceness!
[11:01:23] <agcolom> hi
[11:03:23] <gseguin> so what's happening jqmobros?!
[11:04:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Barreling down on 1.5.0 :)
[11:04:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Though we have so much more to squeeze in ...
[11:04:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, _setOptions() for the classes option.
[11:04:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Lessee here ... https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=47
[11:05:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Need a new sheet ...
[11:06:06] <gseguin> gabriel_schulhof: just got created
[11:06:19] <arschmitz> sorry iv been having some connection issues since upgrading my internet speed go figure
[11:06:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's faster ... when it works.
[11:06:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it is!!!!
[11:06:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've duplicated last week's sheet, but I haven't gotten any further.
[11:06:59] <arschmitz> but the when it works is becoming a real issue
[11:07:33] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I guess we can strike that maybe-no-1.4.5 thing, right?
[11:07:37] <gabriel_schulhof> We do need 1.4.5.
[11:08:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and you've just pushed the _setOptions() for classes a few minutes ago ... so that's progressed.
[11:09:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Dunno about declarative widgets ...
[11:10:02] <arschmitz> and back again
[11:10:18] <arschmitz> so yes classes option is updated
[11:10:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've updated the sheet a bit with stuff I know has been going on.
[11:10:37] <arschmitz> and if i can stay connected long enough to push button has the classes updates now
[11:10:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[11:11:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thanks i think if i tried to load that it would probably kick me off again ha ha
[11:11:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Can you tether for the time being?
[11:11:25] <gabriel_schulhof> IOW, mobile to the rescue :)
[11:11:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah if i get disconnected again i will but id have to disconnect to switch so ill wait
[11:11:56] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:12:08] <arschmitz> alright so yes we will be doing a 1.4.5
[11:12:45] <arschmitz> once button branch is updated il update the dependencies in ui-1-12 branch
[11:13:24] <arschmitz> that will get us everything we need from ui for now execpt for the checkboxradio refresh fix
[11:13:55] <arschmitz> which is next on my todo list
[11:14:31] <arschmitz> so other 1-5 things?
[11:15:14] <jasperdegroot> question about the ui-1-12 branch
[11:15:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Not from me ...
[11:15:35] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: go for it
[11:15:35] <jasperdegroot> are the Mobile data- attributes supposed to work already
[11:15:37] <jasperdegroot> ?
[11:15:52] <arschmitz> yes they should
[11:15:53] <jasperdegroot> like data-enhanced="true", data-corners="false"
[11:15:57] <arschmitz> no
[11:15:59] <arschmitz> not those
[11:16:09] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:16:25] <jasperdegroot> I noticed while working on updating demos in the button-css branch
[11:16:27] <arschmitz> there is no backcompat for the ui widgets yet
[11:16:43] <arschmitz> so in demos this is not an issue though
[11:16:49] <arschmitz> because we need to update to the new api
[11:17:00] <arschmitz> which would be to use classes
[11:17:09] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: the execption being enhanced
[11:17:19] <arschmitz> which is not backcompat we will be keeping that
[11:17:43] <jasperdegroot> yeah, already figured we should not use examples with data-corners="false" etc anymore
[11:17:51] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but all of them were written specificly to support the enhanced option with a single method override and if statement
[11:18:03] <arschmitz> they all use a _enahnced method already
[11:18:17] <arschmitz> we just need to add the option and check it there
[11:18:24] <jasperdegroot> I saw that
[11:18:38] <gabriel_schulhof> There's one other thing that's widget-specific for the enhanced case: how you retrieve the widget's constituent elements.
[11:18:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes that will be in the else of the if :-)
[11:19:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but I'm just wondering if we can't concentrate that in the factory.
[11:19:27] <arschmitz> if !this.options.enhanced else find all that stuff and save it
[11:19:38] <arschmitz> no this will NEVER EVER be in the factory
[11:19:52] <arschmitz> its specific to mobile ui will never support enhanced
[11:19:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[11:20:18] <arschmitz> the ui answer to that will be init free widgets
[11:20:23] <arschmitz> someday
[11:20:35] <arschmitz> because thats really the right way to do it
[11:21:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright. That's fair.
[11:21:11] <arschmitz> autoinit im going to try and find time to get to tomorrow
[11:21:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, and speaking of autoinit.
[11:21:38] <gabriel_schulhof> I ran into a snag for that load-order 1.4.5 bug.
[11:21:54] <gabriel_schulhof> It seems that the pagecontainer circular dependencies are biting us in a tender spot.
[11:22:03] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll look into it some more.
[11:22:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[11:22:24] <arschmitz> So on to new and exciting news
[11:22:44] * gabriel_schulhof transfers his wait to the edge of his seat
[11:22:50] <gabriel_schulhof> s/wait/weight/
[11:23:10] <arschmitz> some of you may have noticed a note in the dev leads meeting notes yesterday about scott_gonzalez and i meeting with Ian Maffett from Appmobi and the intel app framework
[11:23:26] <jasperdegroot> yeah, saw that
[11:23:26] <arschmitz> and noticed ianmaffett here today
[11:24:11] <arschmitz> Ian is going to be working with us helping out
[11:24:33] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: The main goal for our collaboration will be enhancing and cleaning up our navigation
[11:24:40] <jasperdegroot> great!
[11:24:48] <gabriel_schulhof> üëç
[11:24:52] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: has already done work on implementing multiple views in the intel app framework
[11:25:09] <gabriel_schulhof> D000d! Nav needs a whole lotta love!
[11:25:15] <arschmitz> and this is something we have on our roadmap but not work on yet so this seemed like a great point for collaboration
[11:25:17] <cgack> super greate!
[11:25:53] <arschmitz> So there is a new wiki Navigation API where we will start to outline what we want the api to look like and the features that we need
[11:26:45] <arschmitz> Multiple page containers has been a goal of ours for a long time and is super important for tablet layouts and trying to push more desktop use of mobile
[11:27:22] <arschmitz> actually implementing this will likely not be very soon
[11:27:49] <gseguin> cgack: now you're the one adding "e"s everywhere, is that revenge?
[11:27:50] <arschmitz> but the plan is to make incremental changes leading up to this cleaning up our api and adding missing features.
[11:28:18] <cgack> gseguin: haha, no, just can't type
[11:28:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll add a few todo items I remember from recent discussions ...
[11:28:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i have one in a google doc already too
[11:28:54] <arschmitz> just need to transfer it over
[11:29:37] <cgack> pretty sure there's a few navigation artifacts from yesteryear in the issues as well
[11:30:27] <arschmitz> cgack: oh many
[11:30:32] <arschmitz> there is a lot of cleanup to do
[11:30:45] <arschmitz> we still have some crusty hash change code thats only there to support ios4
[11:30:56] <agcolom> Any update on items B9 to B15 in the notes?
[11:30:58] <arschmitz> which has not been supported since 1.2
[11:32:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: jsbin urls i talked to remy
[11:32:14] <arschmitz> and he is willing to give us a subdomain
[11:32:15] <agcolom> great
[11:32:27] <agcolom> Fantastic!
[11:32:35] <arschmitz> so just need to get that setup
[11:32:49] <arschmitz> then we can manage the default template through pr's to jsbin
[11:33:00] <arschmitz> which is fine we dont need to update very often
[11:33:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No update on tables. I got the tests to pass.
[11:33:20] <cgack> agcolom: B11 (navbar) I suppose I can land that PR into the navbar branch (right arschmitz?) and work from the branch and not the fork
[11:33:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok great
[11:33:32] <agcolom> and is a good way to remember to do PRs is jsbin when we have new releases also ;-)
[11:33:34] <arschmitz> cgack: oh yes i keep forgetting that
[11:33:46] <arschmitz> cgack: PLEASE make that into a single branch / pr!
[11:34:08] <cgack> arschmitz: cool, i'll go ahead and merge the PR and stop working on the fork
[11:34:13] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i saw some commits from you for the button css?
[11:34:34] <jasperdegroot> yeah, but not that much progress
[11:34:40] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok
[11:34:48] <jasperdegroot> still need to work on button, checkboxradio, and controlgroup css
[11:34:55] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok
[11:35:17] <jasperdegroot> was updating the demos so I can use them to see if the CSS works correctly
[11:35:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sounds like a good idea
[11:35:47] <jasperdegroot> then ran into the problem that enhanced and data- attributes for styles don't work anymore
[11:35:57] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: once i finish the updates needed in ui ill implement the missing features in mobile
[11:36:07] <jasperdegroot> cool
[11:36:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: its kinda a process at this point
[11:37:41] <arschmitz> update classes, to update button with classes, update button based on new classes update, button bugs, button pr review, pull to mobile, update mobile, finish mobile shims, mobile back compat...
[11:37:58] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: because each step depends on the updates from the previous step
[11:38:15] <jasperdegroot> right, that makes it difficult
[11:38:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Mobile back compat should be good for most widgets.
[11:38:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i meant button checkboxradio and controlgroup specificly
[11:38:48] <arschmitz> because you and cgack are handling everything else
[11:38:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, if classes has _setOptions(), it'll be interesting to deduce from the value of the classes option whether the various style options are true or false.
[11:38:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: those are just the things i need to do personally
[11:39:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right, but synching classes -> style options for backcompat is actually quite a piece of work.
[11:40:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For each widget you need to check whether the right class key has the class ui-corner-all, for example.
[11:40:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah sorry i meant that the list of steps is something i need to do not in response to setoptions
[11:40:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So that's another pre-widget extension point that is deprecated as soon as it's written.
[11:40:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[11:41:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The good news is we can pack it all into $.mobile.behaviors._optionsToClasses (or whatever we end up calling the backcompat module for 1.5.0).
[11:41:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[11:42:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: probably more like $.mobile.backcompat :)
[11:42:16] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:43:27] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: When you start implementing synching style option setting to classes values, look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7318eaf1e98a59f99b47943ac8756ab7b6a2c329
[11:43:55] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: That code should help you construct a new value for a class key in response to style option changes.
[11:44:09] <cgack> gabriel_schulhof: cool, thanks! I most certainly will
[11:44:19] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: I use it in all my classes option PRs.
[11:44:35] <arschmitz> ok so anything else for today?
[11:44:44] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: In fact, all my classes option PR branches branch off that one commit.
[11:45:10] <agcolom> sorry, got to run... pick up time... I'll upload the notes when I get back.
[11:45:20] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm good, I think.
[11:45:28] <jasperdegroot> me too
[11:45:32] <cgack> i'm good
[11:45:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Lotsa work, but it's a ton of fun!
[11:45:42] <arschmitz> ok anything from the community?
[11:45:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it's good to have company doing it :)
[11:46:12] <arschmitz> yes thank you again ldeluca and ianmaffett for getting involved and helping out!
[11:46:25] <ianmaffett> no problem!
[11:46:28] <jasperdegroot> yeah, awesome!
[11:46:30] <ldeluca> arschmitz: happy to help!
[11:47:07] <arschmitz> its nice to feel like we are getting back to a more workable team size :-)
[11:47:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Absolutely!
[11:48:15] <arschmitz> ok thank you everyone see you all back on -dev
[11:48:20] <gabriel_schulhof> K L8R
