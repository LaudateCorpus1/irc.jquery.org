[09:03:35] <m_gol> orkel timmywil rwaldron jaubourg gnarf mikesherov gibson042 DaveMethvin meeting time! :)
[09:03:43] <m_gol> (always wanted to write this ;))
[09:03:59] <jaubourg> lol
[09:04:23] <orkel> :-)
[09:05:18] <jaubourg> I'm half afk fyi, so ding me if you want my input on something specific
[09:05:23] <m_gol> k
[09:05:51] <m_gol> I've been away recently so I might not be fully familiar with what's on the agenda currently
[09:06:02] <m_gol> timmywil, are you here? how's the AMD stuff going?
[09:07:00] <timmywil> yea, I'm here. It's in progress. I'll be working on it more tonight. I should have it presentable by then.
[09:07:26] <m_gol> great!
[09:08:35] <m_gol> orkel, you worked on speed tests, am I right?
[09:09:08] <orkel> only a bit, was focused on our swarm failures
[09:09:42] <orkel> in touch with infrastructure team, dealing with unstable ajax tests
[09:10:18] <jaubourg> you're welcome ;)
[09:10:24] * jaubourg hides
[09:10:32] <jaubourg> ^^
[09:10:39] <m_gol> I was going to look at the order/-webkit-order stuff but I didn't manage to do it before my vacation, I'll get to it today/tomorrow
[09:11:18] <orkel> it's not the tests apparently, it's build.jenkins server configuration problems
[09:11:19] <m_gol> is there anything else I was supposed to look at?
[09:11:41] <m_gol> orkel: tests are for debugging test server? ;)
[09:11:54] <orkel> if there is too much parallel requests they are failling
[09:12:03] <orkel> i wish :-)
[09:13:04] <m_gol> I'm looking at the agenda from last week
[09:13:33] <m_gol> we could go through stuff from there and see what needs to be mentioned today as well
[09:13:52] <m_gol> orkel: did your boxSizingReliable patch get through?
[09:14:05] <orkel> my what?
[09:15:30] <_orkel> sorry, had connection problems
[09:16:14] <_orkel> o, i see from agenda, it was not for boxSizingReliable of FF
[09:16:23] <m_gol> look at the agenda doc from last week :)
[09:16:26] <_orkel> it was for Chrome on pixel thing
[09:16:54] <_orkel> completely unrelated
[09:17:23] <_orkel> order thing is landed
[09:17:44] <m_gol> ah, ok
[09:18:06] <_orkel> patch has not been removed though
[09:18:44] <m_gol> orkel: could you add this to agenda?
[09:19:22] * m_gol orkel: from agenda from last week:"order" (orkel to remove the unit test since it's browser-specific)
[09:19:35] <m_gol> doesn't it conflict with what I'm supposed to do? ;)
[09:21:43] <m_gol> sorry, _orkel, not orkel, apparently ;)
[09:24:09] <m_gol> looks like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1331 could be merged
[09:24:09] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1331 by jdunck (15h 18m ago): Only assign className if changed in addClass and removeClass
[09:28:59] <m_gol> ok, we need to wait for the CLA re-sign
[09:29:01] <m_gol> wrong e-mail
[09:29:09] <timmywil> I think we can close this https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1330
[09:29:09] <b-ot> timmywil: Pull request #1330 by ruzzll (2d 1h ago): optimizing serializeArray
[09:30:23] <timmywil> jaubourg: ^^
[09:30:54] <jaubourg> hey
[09:31:00] <jaubourg> didn't see this one
[09:31:20] <orkel> jaubourg: hey, could you join infrastructure channel for a minute?
[09:31:31] <jaubourg> which channel is it ?
[09:31:41] <jaubourg> timmywil: does it save bytes? (tm)
[09:31:56] <timmywil> jaubourg: I imagine the whole point was to avoid jQuery.map for single values, but maybe the perf advantage isn't worth it?
[09:32:10] <jaubourg> hmmm
[09:32:43] <jaubourg> I honestly dunno what the impact actually is... probably minimal. But it sounds weird to map for an array with a single value, that's for sure
[09:32:47] <orkel> jaubourg: jquery-infrastructure
[09:32:52] <jaubourg> orkel: thanks
[09:33:17] <timmywil> alright, well, we can leave it open for now. He still needs to create a ticket.
[09:33:33] <jaubourg> yeah, let's have a ticket and see where the conversation is going
[09:33:33] <timmywil> or she
[09:33:43] <jaubourg> I don't have any opinion so metrics may be nice
[09:33:47] <jaubourg> or she
[09:33:59] <timmywil> heh
[09:37:11] <m_gol> what about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1311?
[09:37:11] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1311 by chrisprice (3w 3d ago): Revert to ownerDocument.defaultView.getComputedStyle. Fixes #14150
[09:38:26] <timmywil> seams reasonable
[09:39:05] <timmywil> I'd punt to gibson
[09:40:41] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1294 seems fine as well (modulo checking if Android 2.3 supports it (nothing about it will surprise me anymore...))
[09:40:42] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1294 by silverwind (1mon 3w ago): [2.1] Remove obsolete getPreventDefault() usage
[09:46:30] <m_gol> I need to go in a moment
[09:46:41] <m_gol> and the meeting seems sleepy today anyway ;)
[09:47:35] <m_gol> I can merge https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1331 once the reporter re-signs the CLA
[09:47:35] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1331 by jdunck (15h 42m ago): Only assign className if changed in addClass and removeClass
[09:47:47] <m_gol> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1294 after checking Android support
[09:47:48] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1294 by silverwind (1mon 3w ago): [2.1] Remove obsolete getPreventDefault() usage
[09:51:02] <orkel> android support? 0_o
[09:52:32] <m_gol> 2.3
[09:52:53] <m_gol> I'm not sure what's supported on the stock browser, that's all
[09:53:23] <orkel> do want help with that?
[09:53:48] <m_gol> unless you know the answer, I'll just check it on BrowserStack
[09:54:12] <orkel> no, i don't m_gol :-)
[09:54:18] <m_gol> ;)
[09:54:33] <m_gol> k, gotta go, see ya!
[09:54:37] <orkel> bye!
