[08:51:07] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: around?
[09:00:10] <jzaefferer> `uiteam
[09:00:15] <jzaefferer> no bot :/
[09:00:32] <arschmitz> hi
[09:00:36] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:49] <jzaefferer> ping arschmitz arthurvr awayrxaviers fnagel mikesherov rxaviers
[09:00:59] <arthurvr> Hey everybody
[09:01:18] <jzaefferer> stuff: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4ieJTELlFeUo9ycooPTqWv0gtIt-44T-47Y2F_100U/edit#gid=1417768267
[09:01:57] <jzaefferer> Trac is either not working or getting spammed, makes me want to just burn it down
[09:02:16] <jzaefferer> I doubt Scott's guy is ever finishing the upgrade he was working on
[09:02:47] <jzaefferer> sooo
[09:02:51] <jzaefferer> Button is still pending a review
[09:02:53] <arschmitz> so i know  it was being worked on yesterday
[09:02:57] <arschmitz> trac
[09:03:00] <jzaefferer> oh yeah?
[09:03:01] <arthurvr> Trac annoys me, I donâ€™t even have to seriously work with it :p
[09:03:12] <arschmitz> yes s5fs told me
[09:03:18] <arschmitz> he was working with them yesterday
[09:03:23] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:03:28] <jzaefferer> maybe there's hope after all
[09:04:03] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: want to cover your stuff?
[09:04:10] <arschmitz> sure
[09:04:15] <arschmitz> amd demos landed
[09:04:36] <arschmitz> i also updated the core break up to account for that as well as moving the folders
[09:04:43] <arschmitz> so we will have a widgets and an effects folder
[09:04:56] <arschmitz> i did think of one thing with this
[09:05:09] <arschmitz> so we added the core file for backcompat for people using old path
[09:05:32] <arschmitz> well if we are worried about that then the moving effects and widgets is even more breaking
[09:06:41] <jzaefferer> kinda
[09:06:45] <arschmitz> personally i dont think we should worry about it we have done moves like this on mobile with almost every release
[09:06:51] <arschmitz> and no one has ever complained
[09:06:57] <arschmitz> and we have had AMD the whole time
[09:07:15] <jzaefferer> adding "widget/" to one or a few paths isn't a big deal; replacing core.js with the exact files you now need to include is certainly more complicated
[09:07:26] <arschmitz> true
[09:07:36] <jzaefferer> and the file itself is pretty simple
[09:07:38] <arschmitz> and actually when i originally broke up mobile core i did keep a core file
[09:07:43] <arschmitz> that did the same
[09:07:46] <arschmitz> now that you mention it
[09:07:49] <arschmitz> :-p
[09:07:52] <jzaefferer> okay, let's keep it
[09:08:02] <arschmitz> but i think the path changes are fine
[09:08:08] <arschmitz> for widgets and effects
[09:08:22] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:08:35] <jzaefferer> I'm going to review the whole thing
[09:08:48] <arschmitz> so once this lands ill rebase button on master
[09:09:09] <arschmitz> because it needs a pile of updates for demos and core
[09:09:50] <jzaefferer> at least that's the last "touch every file" refactor we've got planned for 1.12, right?
[09:09:59] <arschmitz> as far as i know
[09:10:45] <jzaefferer> are there any tests/ changes that are more than just adding a widget or effect prefix?
[09:11:07] <arschmitz> not that i recall
[09:11:34] <arschmitz> some for the core break up too
[09:11:45] <arschmitz> in the core tests only i think though
[09:12:01] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:12:07] <jzaefferer> I'll check that in more detail later
[09:12:46] <jzaefferer> is rxaviers around?
[09:13:12] <jzaefferer> I know that he merged the 1.12 packer PR, with support for CSS dependencies
[09:13:29] <arschmitz> Yeah i would really like to get a good handle on where we are with that and what i need to do to get movile on it
[09:13:52] <arschmitz> thats a major remaining task for mobile i need to star
[09:13:53] <arschmitz> t
[09:14:18] <jzaefferer> well, its in master, so you should be able to work with that
[09:14:38] <jzaefferer> I don't know what needs to be done to actually make it work with mobile though
[09:15:04] <arschmitz> yeah i need some direction on that
[09:16:36] <jzaefferer> Just remembered that Rafael is on vacation right now
[09:16:45] <arschmitz> yup thts righ
[09:16:51] <jzaefferer> So he should be able to help once back
[09:16:59] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:17:14] <jzaefferer> fnagel: what's the status of Datepicker on Globalize 1.x? I saw the link to your branch, but I've got no idea what's in there
[09:17:14] <fnagel> I remember he said he will return Wed
[09:18:24] <fnagel> Thats scotts datepicker branch (merged with latest master) and this PR #1341 combined
[09:18:42] <fnagel> I'm working on updateing to latest globalize which should fix all tests in this branch.
[09:19:11] <fnagel> Perhaps I will need some help from Rafael
[09:19:34] <jzaefferer> Gotcha
[09:19:39] <jzaefferer> You can ping me, too
[09:20:05] <fnagel> Are you familiar with the usage of Globalize (and its changes since alpha7)?
[09:20:28] <jzaefferer> Somewhat
[09:20:46] <jzaefferer> Not in as much detail as Rafael, but hopefully enough to be able to help
[09:21:14] <jzaefferer> I've looked at some of the code and I'm your timezone!
[09:21:36] <fnagel> Rafael responded on Skype and I need to try that, but if its doesnt work I will ping you, thanks!
[09:23:44] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:24:36] <jzaefferer> So once core-breakup is in master, button can be rebased, reviewed and eventually land, then we're good for a 1.12 beta
[09:24:46] <jzaefferer> Maybe next week even?
[09:25:20] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: how unrealistic is that?
[09:26:11] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: um i would say not very considdering scott has not reviewed most of button at all yet
[09:26:22] <arschmitz> i cant imagine a beta before a full review of it
[09:26:53] <arschmitz> core breakup over all is trivial
[09:27:26] <arschmitz> button is anything but
[09:29:07] <arschmitz> getting the work done from my side is no problem
[09:30:30] <jzaefferer> maybe you can arrange with Scott to do a pair/live review, where you fix stuff directly, like we need
[09:30:34] <jzaefferer> *like we did
[09:30:47] <arschmitz> yeah im fine with whatever works
[09:31:02] <arschmitz> i have no plans aside from work next week lol
[09:31:04] <jzaefferer> Heavily depends on Scott's availability, which we can't plan for
[09:31:07] <jzaefferer> heh, okay
[09:31:08] <jzaefferer> we'll see
[09:31:15] <jzaefferer> we can at least get everything read for that review
[09:31:21] <arschmitz> mostly mobile but button is a priority for sure
[09:32:31] <arschmitz> so one thing regarding release
[09:32:45] <arschmitz> there has been a lot of talk on core about android 2.3 support
[09:33:43] <jzaefferer> I've mostly ignored that
[09:33:57] <jzaefferer> but I see how that's much more interesting to you
[09:34:03] <arschmitz> so technically effects ui
[09:34:16] <arschmitz> because aside from touch stuff we do support mobile
[09:34:41] <arschmitz> and if thats in 3.0 it more or less determins our support for 1.12
[09:34:45] <jzaefferer> A very passive support though
[09:35:06] <jzaefferer> "in 3.0" meaning "dropping Android 2.3 in 3.0"?
[09:35:29] <arschmitz> yes
[09:35:56] <arschmitz> because core is already in alpha for 3.0
[09:35:59] <jzaefferer> Well, we also support 1.7+
[09:36:11] <arschmitz> yes
[09:36:41] <jzaefferer> Should we continue this in -dev? Looks like gabrielschulhof and you are talking there about the same thing
[09:36:57] <arschmitz> yeah thats fine
[09:37:02] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:37:06] <jzaefferer> Thanks everyone!
[09:37:12] <arthurvr> bye
[09:37:28] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: thanks for complaining about Trac!
[09:37:38] <arthurvr> my pleasure :)
