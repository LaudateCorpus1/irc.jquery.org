[11:54:37] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2902
[11:54:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2902 on jquery-mobile, reported by cfjedimaster (1w, 2d ago): Provide a downloadable version of the jQuery Mobile docs
[11:54:49] <toddparker> docs are going to be be a zip with each stable release
[11:55:10] <toddparker> complete
[11:55:20] <toddparker> thanks eddiemonge
[11:58:49] <eddiemonge> Docs will be output to {LOCAL-JQM-GIT-CLONE}/compiled/jquery.mobile.docs.zip if a user does make docs
[11:58:49] <eddiemonge> For stable releases, the file will be at http://code.jquery.com/mobile/VERSION/jquery.mobile-VERSION.docs.zip
[12:01:52] <eddiemonge> i think that went reasonably far better than skype
[12:02:28] <garann> doing it w/o video feels weird
[12:03:08] <eddiemonge> i thought the opposite lol
