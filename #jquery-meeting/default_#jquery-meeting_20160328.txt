[12:00:17] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol, markelog https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhcW9_TlSwD8JnO1_HNnSYJAriTK9WYZ8uQNDvtAAhA/edit#
[12:00:29] <DaveMethvin> be there in a sec
[12:02:13] <DaveMethvin> ok
[12:02:42] <DaveMethvin> i have a few prs ready for migrate, and will get to a few more this week
[12:03:24] <DaveMethvin> i think i can get them all except the show/hide https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues
[12:04:06] <timmywil> cool
[12:04:18] <timmywil> and the only thing left on the upgrade guide is show/hide, yea?
[12:04:31] <DaveMethvin> i think so
[12:04:38] <timmywil> ok
[12:04:38] <DaveMethvin> it's the only one that's really critical
[12:04:47] <DaveMethvin> the others are nice to have but we could ship without them
[12:04:57] <gibson042> I swear I'll do it this week
[12:05:06] <timmywil> :)
[12:05:06] <markelog> this is still a blocker - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2863
[12:05:40] <DaveMethvin> i'm gonna be traveling weds-sun but may have some time to do some issues during downtime in airports
[12:06:05] <gibson042> that one too
[12:06:16] <timmywil> I just finished up my assigned issues (see first 2 PRs in the PRs list).
[12:06:55] <timmywil> I want to check with everyone that we're okay with dropping sync ready execution.
[12:06:59] <timmywil> I am
[12:07:07] <DaveMethvin> 3.0 is the time to do it :)
[12:07:23] <DaveMethvin> it fixes the bug where one error halts everything
[12:07:33] <timmywil> yea, and we get to use .then
[12:08:07] <timmywil> and behavior is aligned with ready-no-deffered now
[12:08:16] <timmywil> can't spell
[12:08:54] <timmywil> and I've implemented gibson042's suggestion for the base href in parseHTML
[12:09:05] <timmywil> I'd like to land both of those asap
[12:09:24] <DaveMethvin> i had a concern with the parsetHTML
[12:09:32] <timmywil> impossible
[12:10:04] <DaveMethvin> we pass in context for our own internal $()
[12:10:20] <DaveMethvin> so the new behavior only comes into play with direct calls mostly
[12:10:27] <DaveMethvin> we need to document the change
[12:10:35] <DaveMethvin> and/or
[12:10:51] <DaveMethvin> we need to stop passing context for $() if it wasn't explicitly specified
[12:11:09] <timmywil> I suppose we *could* use document.implementation even when there's a context
[12:11:18] <DaveMethvin> although the latter might cause other stuff to break
[12:11:25] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[12:11:37] <DaveMethvin> as long as we doc the change for parseHTML i'm good
[12:11:46] <DaveMethvin> we just need a ticket for it in api.jquery.com i think
[12:11:56] <timmywil> ok, you wanna open that?
[12:11:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:12:01] <timmywil> thx
[12:12:22] <timmywil> I think it's been long enough we could release 1.12.3 with the one commmit
[12:12:31] <timmywil> commmmmmit
[12:13:19] <DaveMethvin> mmmmm, commits
[12:13:25] <DaveMethvin> i guess, sure
[12:13:26] <timmywil> but we'll push the rc to next week to give gibson042 more time
[12:14:01] <gibson042> hopefully it won't need a full week, but yes
[12:14:11] <timmywil> we covered all that pretty quickly :)
[12:15:07] <timmywil> I think we know what to do this week. Anything else?
[12:15:43] <timmywil> markelog?
[12:15:56] <markelog> i'm good :)
[12:16:21] <timmywil> cool! see you in -dev all
[12:16:25] <markelog> see ya
