[10:02:28] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting time!
[10:02:55] <arschmitz> Hi
[10:04:13] <sfrisk> arschmitz, kristyjy, michealarestad arthurvr geekman-rohit
[10:04:30] <arthurvr> ‘Allo ‘Allo!
[10:05:46] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:09:22] <sfrisk> Okay, so up first is a really quick one, which cvrebert brought up, about adding info about the weekly IRC meeting to CONTRIBUTING.md
[10:10:13] <sfrisk> I have a one paragraph update I did to CONTRIBUTING.md with information about the meeting: https://github.com/sfrisk/css-chassis/blob/98-Add-IRC-Meeting/CONTRIBUTING.md
[10:10:34] <sfrisk> If people can't find anything horrifically wrong with it, I'll pull it in after the meeting
[10:10:50] <geekman-rohit> looks good to me +1
[10:11:12] <arschmitz> i might add a link to the actual meeting log
[10:11:30] <arschmitz> on irc http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/
[10:12:56] <geekman-rohit> also mention freenode
[10:13:02] <geekman-rohit> if thats okay
[10:13:19] <sfrisk> Will do
[10:13:32] <arschmitz> i added a comment with a couple more thnings
[10:13:48] <sfrisk> Sounds good
[10:15:03] <sfrisk> I'll update my PR with any comments people add to that
[10:15:12] <sfrisk> then pull it in
[10:15:25] <sfrisk> Next on the list is The initial pass of the buttons pr
[10:15:44] <sfrisk> It's the first PR we've had that we've used the BEM naming scheme we agreed on
[10:15:50] <sfrisk> so kind of a test to make sure that works
[10:16:50] <sfrisk> also geekman-rohit brought up a good point that the blues we currently have from the logo that isaacdurazo designed don't pass contrasting tests, so we'll need to come up with some different colors to use for the base Chassis theme
[10:17:11] <sfrisk> I think this is important, since one of our goals is to be as accessible as we possibly cna be
[10:17:23] <geekman-rohit> same goes for progress as we might need to add "60%" etc to the bars
[10:18:17] <arschmitz> I know dylan offered to work on checks for this stuff which has been on my todo for a long time
[10:18:37] <arschmitz> I can work with him on this for what we want if you want i know dylan and have worked with him before
[10:18:56] <sfrisk> sounds good tome
[10:19:01] <sfrisk> to me* even
[10:19:05] <arschmitz> He is an accessibility expert from deque he is the right person for the job for sure
[10:19:28] <sfrisk> Ah! I thought that was him
[10:19:37] <sfrisk> I wasn't sure though
[10:21:47] <sfrisk> So as for buttons, I wanted to add a few more button types rather than just "primary"
[10:21:55] <sfrisk> and add options for button blocks
[10:22:01] <sfrisk> or button groups
[10:22:06] <arschmitz> button blocks is important
[10:22:21] <arschmitz> button groups is part of both ui and mobile we call them controlgroups though
[10:22:34] <sfrisk> we can call 'em that instead
[10:22:36] <arschmitz> as they can also contain selects, checkboxes, textboxes etc
[10:22:39] <sfrisk> ahh
[10:22:53] <sfrisk> that's a bit more complicated than I originally planned for button blocks
[10:22:58] <arschmitz> a "grouping of controls"
[10:23:22] <arschmitz> to me a controlgroup makes more sense because its a lot more flexible
[10:23:33] <arschmitz> also buttons checkboxes and selects are all types of buttons
[10:23:47] <arschmitz> in this context
[10:25:06] <arschmitz> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/controlgroup/#Textinputs
[10:25:14] <arschmitz> that shows some with a few types in them
[10:25:29] <sfrisk> Okay, makes sense
[10:25:29] <arschmitz> these are useful for building things like the toolbar for a gui editor
[10:25:50] <sfrisk> In this case though - I want this issue related to buttons only
[10:25:57] <sfrisk> "control group" might be a seperate issue
[10:26:02] <arschmitz> but does it make sense to have both
[10:26:05] <sfrisk> that happens after base form styling happens
[10:26:09] <arschmitz> a button group seems redundant
[10:26:24] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:26:28] <arschmitz> would a button group be a controlgroup with only buttons in it
[10:26:34] <sfrisk> I'll switch 'button group' to be part of control group
[10:26:40] <sfrisk> and hold off it with this PR
[10:27:03] <arschmitz> that would make sense to me just not to duplicate effort if we want to have the concept of a controlgroup
[10:27:52] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:28:15] <sfrisk> Also if anyone has other color suggestions - or different button ideas, I would love to hear them
[10:28:23] <sfrisk> right now I have 'default' and 'primary'
[10:28:30] <sfrisk> I thought about having an error button
[10:29:01] <arschmitz> active
[10:29:09] <arschmitz> focus maybe depending
[10:29:14] <arschmitz> alert
[10:29:38] <arschmitz> highlight
[10:29:39] <sfrisk> have those
[10:29:44] <sfrisk> not highlight
[10:30:08] <sfrisk> but I have individual classes for active/focus/hover/disabled
[10:30:16] <arschmitz> bootstrap has success
[10:30:20] <arschmitz> and warning
[10:30:25] <arschmitz> and info
[10:31:14] <arschmitz> which seems to kinda mirror default console stuff lol
[10:31:18] <sfrisk> lol
[10:31:23] <sfrisk> i mean I could added those cases
[10:31:24] <arschmitz> which is not a bad thing
[10:31:36] <sfrisk> not sure what colors to make 'em, but I definitely can add 'em
[10:31:49] <arschmitz> well success should be green
[10:31:56] <arschmitz> info is normally a light blue
[10:32:05] <arschmitz> warning yellow or orange
[10:32:07] <arschmitz> error red
[10:32:18] <arschmitz> most of these are fairly defined in practical usage
[10:32:50] <sfrisk> More of 'specific colors that work together'
[10:32:59] <sfrisk> I can go see if I can get a color palette together
[10:33:11] <arschmitz> yeah thats not my strong point
[10:33:17] <arschmitz> but i can tell you if i like them after lol
[10:35:34] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll play aorund with it this week and get a demo of other buttons up in the next few days
[10:36:05] <sfrisk> In addition to button blocks
[10:36:18] <arschmitz> blocks is important for mobile
[10:36:19] <sfrisk> so hopefully we can start having stuff besides typography in our code!
[10:36:25] <sfrisk> Yeah, agreed
[10:36:32] <sfrisk> Resizing my screen made that SUPER obvious :-)
[10:36:52] <arschmitz> in jquery mobile we do all our controls 100% by default
[10:37:06] <arschmitz> and have an inline modifier class
[10:37:32] <arschmitz> if we are going for mobile first we may consider a similar approach
[10:38:16] <sfrisk> In which case, I'll adjust my mixin to switch to the "inline" after mobile sizing
[10:38:37] <sfrisk> although a 'block' modifier keeps it at a block all the way up?
[10:39:06] <arschmitz> that not always bad
[10:39:15] <arschmitz> your design may call for a panel
[10:39:24] <arschmitz> where you still want 100% no matter the size
[10:39:33] <arschmitz> the same argument could be made the other way around
[10:40:06] <arschmitz> its really just what we think makes sense for the default
[10:40:42] <arschmitz> im fine with either block or inline by default i was just pointing out what we do on JQM and saying if we are writing our css mobile first we may consider a similar approach
[10:41:02] <sfrisk> I might be inclined to go with a 'block' option
[10:41:16] <sfrisk> just because I can think of a lot of mobile cases where you might have multiple buttons on one line
[10:41:41] <arschmitz> sure there are cases for both types at any screen size
[10:41:51] <arschmitz> i really think this is mostly prefrence
[10:42:03] <arschmitz> and which we think is "more common"
[10:42:14] <sfrisk> I could bring it up on the issue
[10:42:19] <sfrisk> get more feedback then who is in here
[10:42:30] <arschmitz> also we could make block the default on small screens and inline on larger
[10:42:35] <arschmitz> but that could get weird fast i worry
[10:43:27] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:45:38] <sfrisk> Okay, added a note, hopefully people will comment there
[10:45:45] <sfrisk> since the button PR seems to have been pretty active
[10:45:59] <sfrisk> 30 comments!
[10:49:04] <arschmitz> yup
[10:49:16] <arschmitz> i have not even had a chance to look closely yet either
[10:49:32] <arschmitz> there was so much activity i was waiting for it to settle a little lol
[10:49:47] <sfrisk> well at this point I was waiting for some thumbs up, then I was going to add other buttons
[10:49:57] <sfrisk> more just wanted to make sure my approach is what the group had in mind
[10:50:16] <sfrisk> although I'm failing Travis right now :-(
[10:52:27] <arschmitz> did you run the tests before you pushed ? :-)
[10:52:39] <sfrisk> haha, I have, I have too many font-size declarations
[10:52:53] <sfrisk> also it doesn't like the aria disabled case
[10:53:33] <sfrisk> &[aria-disabled="true"]
[10:54:43] <arschmitz> if there are rules we intentionally dont care about we can adjust that
[10:55:00] <sfrisk> I might adjust the font size and the aria-disabled one
[10:55:27] <arschmitz> font size makes sense to me
[10:55:48] <arschmitz> is it failing the compiled file or the source
[10:55:59] <arschmitz> it could see in the compiled because of the nature of bem
[10:56:04] <arschmitz> but the source should not
[10:56:18] <sfrisk> WARNING: Too many font-size declarations (49), abstraction needed. Checks the number of font-size declarations. (font-sizes) Browsers: All
[10:56:35] <sfrisk> as far as I've been able to tell, it's one font-size declaration per class
[10:56:50] <sfrisk> I got a different error when I was accidentally declaring background 2x
[10:56:51] <arschmitz> you need to look at what file is failing
[10:56:58] <arschmitz> is it a source file or a built file
[10:57:13] <sfrisk> chassis.lint.css [General] error
[10:57:17] <sfrisk> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/css-chassis/builds/71808282
[10:58:03] <arschmitz> so yeah we should disable fontsize for the built file
[10:58:11] <arschmitz> it will always fail if we use bem
[10:58:14] <sfrisk> okay I can add that in my next commit
[10:58:29] <arschmitz> the attribute thing is kinda legit though it is a perf concern
[10:58:38] <sfrisk> true
[10:59:14] <sfrisk> I mean I have everything keyed of disabled, that attribute was suggested by cvrebert
[10:59:28] <arschmitz> also make sure you adjust the fontsize so it still enforces that rule on the source but not the dist
[10:59:38] <sfrisk> and allows us to toggle the disabledness of an <a>
[10:59:51] <sfrisk> will do
[10:59:59] <arschmitz> you can do that with out an attribute
[11:00:11] <arschmitz> you can apply the same rules via calss
[11:00:30] <arschmitz> its also really heavy handed
[11:00:58] <arschmitz> you might want something to be disabled via aria but not via other interaction methods or the other way around
[11:01:16] <arschmitz> like if your dealing with a touch / gesture interface that can possible work via screen reader
[11:01:46] <arschmitz> you may disable some parts to screen readers and other to regular input so as not to confuse the screen reader user with interaction methods they cant use
[11:02:10] <arschmitz> since things like tap swipe etc cant be done with a screen reader
[11:03:21] <arschmitz> i can respond to him on the issue though
[11:07:17] <sfrisk> (sorry, catching up, got dragged away real quick)
[11:07:49] <sfrisk> Yeah, I can remove it for now, or we could have a more in depth discussion about it in the issue
[11:08:40] <sfrisk> Also double checking, we came up with the decision last week that the media query mixin was no longer necessary, correct?
[11:08:49] <arschmitz> correct
[11:08:54] <sfrisk> If that is the case, I will close the PR and Issue
[11:09:16] <arschmitz> maybe check with kristyjy but yeah i think thats the right move
[11:09:26] <sfrisk> kristyjy, you around?
[11:09:37] <sfrisk> also make the fixes suggested in jsass-vars, arschmitz, and I'll pull that in so we can start using that
[11:09:49] <arschmitz> also there is still kinda work to be done with mixins
[11:09:52] <arschmitz> not mixins
[11:09:55] <kristyjy> okay that's fine I'll just use normal media query syntax in the style guide instead
[11:09:56] <arschmitz> media queries
[11:10:05] <arschmitz> to do the named ones we talked about if thats the path we want
[11:11:17] <sfrisk> we could adjust the PRs to deal with that
[11:11:29] <sfrisk> named ones being specifying the difference breakpoints, correct
[11:11:36] <sfrisk> mobile, tablet, desktop?
[11:12:38] <kristyjy> personally I don't like the idea of naming breakpoints by device but that's just me. I'd rather do something like small,medium,large
[11:12:46] <sfrisk> we can do that too
[11:12:54] <sfrisk> I'm not married to the idea of mobile/tablet/desktop
[11:13:04] <sfrisk> especially since phones these days are hitting borderline tablet sizes :-)
[11:13:33] <kristyjy> exactly why I try to avoid it now.. it's just plain confusing now lol
[11:14:19] <geekman-rohit> not exactly.. a larger phone will still show 640 x 320 resolution to css
[11:14:26] <geekman-rohit> but agreed
[11:14:38] <geekman-rohit> small  medium large should be how we do it
[11:15:05] <sfrisk> small medium large, we'll decide the default sizes, but make them variables so that way it can be adjusted as needbe
[11:15:23] <sfrisk> kristyjy, do you have suggestions for different sizes?
[11:15:27] <geekman-rohit> ya and how many breakpoints?
[11:16:42] <kristyjy> hmmm good question. In personal projects I've done 4 in the past (400,768,920,1200) but I'm certainly not married to it or think it's perfect lol
[11:17:46] <sfrisk> so extra small, small, medium, large?
[11:17:58] <sfrisk> or small, medium, large, giant
[11:18:00] <geekman-rohit> yep sounds good
[11:18:13] <geekman-rohit> extra small small ----
[11:18:18] <kristyjy> cool
[11:18:45] <geekman-rohit> is better, we need not worry about 1920+
[11:19:22] <sfrisk> Okay, so close existing issue, but I think we should update typography's media queries to follow that structure
[11:19:45] <sfrisk> That should be a pretty quick PR if someone wants to do that
[11:20:17] <sfrisk> *cough* Kristyjy *cough cough*
[11:20:25] <geekman-rohit> we need a PR for the structure itself first
[11:21:03] <sfrisk> Structure as in a grid? Because we're already using media queries
[11:21:21] <geekman-rohit> i mean we need tho decide names of these variables first
[11:21:22] <arschmitz> sorry stepped away for a sec catching up
[11:21:41] <geekman-rohit> and add them, then modify typography accordingly
[11:21:49] <sfrisk> I thought it was extra-small/ small/ medium/ large?
[11:22:17] <arschmitz> so minor nit pick
[11:22:24] <arschmitz> but based on common screen sizes
[11:22:36] <arschmitz> nah nevermind
[11:22:57] <kristyjy> should we have $bp-small or just $small?
[11:23:06] <geekman-rohit> yeah my point
[11:23:10] <geekman-rohit> or $xs
[11:23:11] <arschmitz> was going to suggest extra large instead of extra small but i like extra small better
[11:23:19] <geekman-rohit> $sm
[11:24:08] <sfrisk> maybe $screen-small
[11:24:09] <arschmitz> i like
[11:24:31] <arschmitz> --sm-viewport
[11:24:34] <sfrisk> or having a bit in the beginning of the variable to make it clear we're talking about screensizes
[11:24:36] <arschmitz> https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid/blob/master/src/css/flexboxgrid.css
[11:24:37] <sfrisk> or end
[11:24:38] <kristyjy> I have no preference on this.. well just don't make it TOO long lol
[11:24:53] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz not the modifier the varibale itself
[11:24:55] <sfrisk> $this-is-a-variable-for-small-screen-sizes
[11:25:05] <kristyjy> yeah like anything but what sfrisk just said
[11:25:25] <geekman-rohit> lol my point was its better if we add the variables in a PR
[11:25:28] <arschmitz> im not talking about the modifier
[11:25:32] <geekman-rohit> and then modify typography
[11:25:39] <arschmitz> im talking about the variable thats just not scss lol
[11:26:06] <arschmitz> its myth lol
[11:26:18] <arschmitz> but the idea stands
[11:27:05] <arschmitz> i like viewport
[11:27:15] <sfrisk> Ahh, geekman-rohit, I had intended the variables and typography would be in one pr
[11:27:24] <geekman-rohit> we might soon set a record for our longest meeting yet
[11:27:28] <sfrisk> part one assigns the variables, and the other half shows an example of implementation
[11:27:35] <geekman-rohit> cool :)
[11:27:55] <arschmitz> viewport is what the sm is actually referring to
[11:27:58] <arschmitz> not screen size
[11:27:58] <sfrisk> I'm trying to think if we've had a longer meeting or not
[11:28:07] <sfrisk> viewport then
[11:28:13] <geekman-rohit> exactly
[11:28:59] <sfrisk> well if someone wants to do that PR, that could be a quick one
[11:29:28] <sfrisk> although if I get jsass landed tonight, that might be preferable so I can start adjusting the buttons PR to do variables that way
[11:29:45] <arschmitz> sfrisk: bug me tonight and ill land it
[11:29:50] <sfrisk> bug
[11:29:51] <sfrisk> bug
[11:29:52] <sfrisk> bug
[11:29:52] <sfrisk> bug
[11:29:53] <geekman-rohit> i'll do it if no one takes it up by the end of meeting
[11:29:54] <sfrisk> bug
[11:30:07] <sfrisk> Okay, sounds good geekman-rohit
[11:30:07] <arschmitz> iv just been crazy busy and its not paid time anymore
[11:30:15] <sfrisk> Yeah, I hear ya :-(
[11:30:43] <geekman-rohit> so what have we decided?
[11:30:57] <geekman-rohit> $small?
[11:31:06] <sfrisk> viewpoint-small I think
[11:31:12] <geekman-rohit> or $viewport-small
[11:31:13] <geekman-rohit> cool
[11:31:17] <arschmitz> why small instead of sm
[11:31:17] <sfrisk> or something with 'viewpoint' in it
[11:31:18] <arschmitz> ?
[11:31:24] <geekman-rohit> sm actually
[11:31:27] <sfrisk> viewpoint-sm
[11:31:29] <geekman-rohit> i just like @sm
[11:31:32] <geekman-rohit> $sm **
[11:31:45] <geekman-rohit> viewport*
[11:31:51] <sfrisk> port
[11:31:55] <sfrisk> wow words are hard
[11:32:01] <arschmitz> my personal prefrence is sm-viewport
[11:32:06] <arschmitz> md-vieport
[11:32:14] <arschmitz> xs-viewport
[11:32:18] <arschmitz> lg-viewport
[11:32:31] <sfrisk> goes against bem naming though, that's my only thing
[11:32:32] <arschmitz> but all spelled correctly
[11:32:35] <sfrisk> lg is a modifyer of viewport
[11:32:37] <arschmitz> its a variable
[11:32:39] <sfrisk> modifier even
[11:32:43] <geekman-rohit> ya a variable
[11:32:53] <geekman-rohit> we can have grid--viewport__sm
[11:32:55] <arschmitz> variables have nothing to do with bem
[11:32:58] <geekman-rohit> or something like that in grid
[11:33:03] <sfrisk> yeah, I just like consistent naming of things
[11:33:15] <geekman-rohit> siewport-sm then
[11:33:51] <arschmitz> also grid should not say viewport
[11:34:08] <sfrisk> grid probably wouldn't have viewport in it
[11:34:10] <arschmitz> it should just be like grid-col--sm
[11:34:22] <arschmitz> but in our convention
[11:34:30] <sfrisk> yup
[11:34:37] <sfrisk> okay, I really need to get back to work
[11:34:48] <sfrisk> we only hit 4 things on my list :-(
[11:35:01] <sfrisk> anyway, I have some issues listed in the agenda that need people to work on them
[11:35:12] <sfrisk> so if you're bored, have some free time, and want to do some coding, there is a list there
[11:35:27] <arschmitz> the perf testing stuff has been waiting on jsass
[11:35:32] <sfrisk> And since arschmitz is the only one looking at it right now: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[11:35:53] <arschmitz> jsass came out of fixing the perf stuff
[11:36:08] <sfrisk> okay, adjusted accordingly
[11:36:28] <sfrisk> also geekman-rohit, your <progress><meter> issue?
[11:36:45] <geekman-rohit> lol i tried to animate them based on sfrisks suggestion
[11:36:51] <geekman-rohit> we will onl have animated fallback
[11:37:05] <geekman-rohit> progress and meter element themeselves have poor support with css3 animation
[11:37:22] <arschmitz> not suprised
[11:37:24] <sfrisk> okay
[11:37:34] <sfrisk> if things change there with css3 animation, we can adjust later
[11:37:56] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[11:38:38] <geekman-rohit> i should be able to do a PR soon (later this week, I mean really. I know i have said that before about this)
[11:38:43] <sfrisk> Awesome
[11:39:13] <sfrisk> sounds good
[11:39:30] <arschmitz> well at almost double length i think its time to call this one
[11:39:42] <arschmitz> anything else we can discuss in css-chassis i think
[11:39:46] <sfrisk> Okay, sounds good
[11:39:55] <sfrisk> Chassis, Out!
[11:40:01] <arschmitz> or in the issue
[11:40:06] <sfrisk> yes, agreed
[11:40:09] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[11:40:17] <geekman-rohit> 1 hour 40 mins
