[09:00:05] <fnagel> hi
[09:00:35] <jzaefferer> ola
[09:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz_ updated the button PR
[09:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> And jzaefferer started another round of reviw.
[09:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything that needs to be discussed for that/
[09:03:35] <jzaefferer> Should we have this._super() calls in all _getCreateOptions() implementations?
[09:03:51] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1513/files#r39640725
[09:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[09:05:47] <arschmitz_> yeah it makes it impossoble to use with extensions otherwise
[09:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's just selectmenu and spinner.
[09:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> I can update those.
[09:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'll change the base implementation to return an empty object instead of being a noop.
[09:08:38] <arschmitz_> makes sense
[09:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for button?
[09:11:24] <arschmitz_> nothing from me
[09:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that brings us to datepicker.
[09:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1590
[09:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> JÃ¶rn and I have both reviewed that.
[09:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like theres's still some pending updates.
[09:14:59] <fnagel> Almost ready, waiting for some answers jzaefferer
[09:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like rxaviers is here to discuss CLDR meeting.
[09:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> So, CJS....
[09:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> Juho provided an example of what we should do.
[09:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if anyone wants to own that task.
[09:22:56] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I just sent a PR with some style updates that have always bothered me (and the sad thing is I'm the one who made it that way): https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1597
[09:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's everything, unless anyone has something to discuss.
[09:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
