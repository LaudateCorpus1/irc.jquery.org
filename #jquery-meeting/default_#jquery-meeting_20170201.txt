[12:01:58] <arschmitz> fnagel: jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: meeting time
[12:02:05] <fnagel> hi
[12:02:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: might be a few minutes late
[12:05:35] <arschmitz> im a little out of touch with the outstanding issues at the moment
[12:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> Hey, I'm here!
[12:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: You're supposed to be looking into this datepicker bug on iOS 10: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15050
[12:06:31] <arschmitz> oh wow yeah for a LONG time now
[12:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> We were pretty busy for a LONG time.
[12:07:04] <arschmitz> yeah was just going to say opened 4 months ago
[12:07:08] <arschmitz> sounds like start of EOD
[12:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> This button ticket is also assigned to you: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15109
[12:08:32] <arschmitz> ok thats an easy fix
[12:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ok to mark that as a blocker for 1.12.2?
[12:09:07] <arschmitz> yes
[12:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> This is the next bug I'm going to work on: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15084
[12:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> Resizable - setting handles option removes previous handles
[12:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> This is a regression caused by a fix for custom handles that landed earlier.
[12:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> Once those two bugs are fixed, I'd like to do the 1.12.2 release.
[12:10:43] <arschmitz> sounds good
[12:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess we need to fix https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15089 also
[12:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> bower distribution of jquery-ui does not include minified widgets
[12:12:14] <arschmitz> right also an easy fix i believe
[12:12:58] <arschmitz> we could fix by just removing the whole minified folder too... lol
[12:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, probably just a globbing problem.
[12:13:09] <arschmitz> i assumed that was the case
[12:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> That was my original idea. You'll notice I closed the ticket.
[12:13:16] <arschmitz> yes
[12:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel merged all of the datepicker PRs we discussed last week.
[12:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> Need to add the date to the `select` and `change` events: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1786
[12:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> Jon Gunderson pointed out that `aria-hidden` on the grid cells is hiding the calendar from AT: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1788
[12:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> `numberOfMonths` could not be changed after initialization: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1787
[12:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> And he asked Jon to do another accessibility review.
[12:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Anything we need to discuss for datepicker/calendar?
[12:16:29] <fnagel> not really
[12:17:03] <fnagel> waiting for some feedback of Jon or some free time to come up with some WIP specs for a11y
[12:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you want to go through the demos, make sure we have the demos we need/want, verify they're all working correctly, and then help flesh out tests?
[12:18:37] <fnagel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1788#issuecomment-275962812
[12:20:01] <fnagel> If so, make sure to red the wiki todo's regarding tests and demos
[12:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> We also still have an issue with the Vader theme: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/338
[12:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still not sure what makes the theme invalid, but my plan is to just change the theme to use the settings from the URL I posted in the issue.
[12:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> Sadly nobody has responded about that since I posted it two weeks ago :-/
[12:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> But since it worked for me, it should work for everyone.
[12:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> This was my attempt at fixing it half a year ago: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/commit/817082495dba24ce73e11b459d0ab87441a8574d
[12:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> But there's still something wrong.
[12:24:10] <arschmitz> yeah i remember us fixing this before
[12:25:15] <fnagel> commented on the ticket
[12:25:18] <fnagel> can confirm
[12:26:43] <fnagel> oh man, GH is slow, like really slow
[12:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> Hearing nothing, we'll end the meeting.
[12:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
