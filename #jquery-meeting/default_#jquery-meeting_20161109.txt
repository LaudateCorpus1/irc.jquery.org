[12:01:09] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:54] <jzaefferer> oi
[12:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> Felix's datepicker PR was finally merged!
[12:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1755
[12:03:19] <jzaefferer> A bit over a month :-)
[12:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> I landed a bunch of other PRs too.
[12:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> We're down to 9 open PRs.
[12:03:42] <jzaefferer> Started out as improving tests, ended up with a lot more...
[12:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately, I didn't have time to look into tickets.
[12:04:29] <jzaefferer> Only 3 open PRs from this year...
[12:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, some of them are just stalled. Like the PEP and intern ones aren't things that can land and haven't been touched in forever.
[12:06:02] <jzaefferer> yeah
[12:06:09] <jzaefferer> This Triage report looks odd: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=new&type=bug&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=version&report=30&order=id
[12:06:55] <jzaefferer> I guess I just haven't looked at it in a long time
[12:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of tickets just haven't been triaged.
[12:08:51] <jzaefferer> 3 less :-)
[12:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Have you gotten a chance to look at any of the tickets?
[12:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing that answer will be no.
[12:09:40] <arschmitz> i actually started looking at the datepicker one
[12:09:43] <arschmitz> with ios 10
[12:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah?
[12:09:50] <arschmitz> but no answer to whats going on yet
[12:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:09:59] <arschmitz> but its happening for sure lol
[12:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing worth discussing came up in the past week, so having not made progress on any of the tickets, I don't think there's much to discuss today.
[12:13:59] <fnagel> sorry, I'm late
[12:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, hey fnagel.
[12:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe you'll have some input on this selectmenu bug.
[12:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15091
[12:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> We're currently using `role="combobox"` but it looks like we should be using `role="listbox"`
[12:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> But doing that seems non-trivial.
[12:15:29] <fnagel> naahh, I'm not exactly sure, but I think this was a case of "specs says so, but that's not working in real world"
[12:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> We discussed some details last week: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20161102.log.html#t12:10:03
[12:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so the question is does this actually cause issues for any users?
[12:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can get input from TPG, Deque, or OCAD?
[12:17:36] <fnagel> Ohh I missed last week becasue <same issue as each year>
[12:18:40] <fnagel> Question #2: does using a combobox improve what we have?
[12:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> Do you mean does using listbox improve what we have?
[12:21:00] <fnagel> yeah sorry
[12:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, presumably just the use of the role will improve usability because users will know that they can't type arbitrary values.
[12:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[12:29:00] <fnagel> we might discuss calendar next steps
[12:29:33] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:31:07] <fnagel> just for the record: I'was not able to find any discussion yet, but this is the commit we added combox to the button https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/4dbbd0598a58277816289441f3278a65025515d3
[12:31:49] <scott_gonzalez> This is still pending? Add calendar and datepicker to the requirejs task in the Gruntfile
[12:32:21] <fnagel> Not sure, without looking into the code
[12:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, still pending.
[12:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to look into that? It might be straight-forward now.
[12:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing this was a holdover just because of the i18n files.
[12:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> But those are gone.
[12:34:45] <fnagel> I guess so
[12:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying right now.
[12:35:23] <fnagel> What about "Think about parameter for callback events" and those little test issues like "Decide on how to date objects should be initialized within the tests" and "Add assertion that verifies where the focus should be"
[12:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, here's something fairly easy.
[12:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> Removing use of QUnit globals in tests.
[12:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's a script we can run to do that.
[12:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> What are the options for initializing date objects?
[12:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> Writing focus tests seems like a good next step.
[12:37:36] <fnagel> Options are with or without $month - 1 within the date constructor
[12:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, I've grown to like the `- 1`.
[12:38:00] <fnagel> hehe
[12:38:10] <fnagel> good I've waited two year :-D
[12:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you know where the script is that replaces QUnit globals with the non-globals?
[12:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Do focus tests sound good to you as a next step?
[12:42:48] <fnagel> yes and no
[12:43:17] <fnagel> a11y for multiple month is another probably not that tiny issue
[12:43:37] <fnagel> event callbacks could be done before finalizing tests
[12:43:41] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. I was thinking you'd start with just the focus tests for single month.
[12:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'll spend some time today looking at the events.
[12:46:16] <fnagel> Tests are actually not that bad at the moment, but I think its best to specify and implement a behaviour for both, single (done) and multiple (not yet) and than look into improving and adding tests
[12:47:28] <fnagel> just to make sure: we stick to "month -1"? If so, I will remove the wiki item
[12:47:35] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for today?
[12:51:40] <fnagel> "Add assertion that verifies where the focus should be"
[12:52:36] <fnagel> I think thats no longer relevant as the code has been removed : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1430/files#r23173532
[12:53:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you mean this? https://github.com/apsdehal/qunit-migrate
[12:53:23] <jzaefferer> Found the link here: http://qunitjs.com/upgrade-guide-2.x/
[12:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:54:19] <fnagel> Ok, I will give it a try
[12:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> That's the one. Thanks jzaefferer.
[12:54:23] <fnagel> thanks
[12:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> So focus doesn't actually move?
[12:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> We just use ARIA attributes to indicate focus?
[12:56:07] <fnagel> Nah, I guess the wiki item is not a good description what j√∂rn wanted me to do. I will come up with something.
[12:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today. Thanks everyone.
[13:01:04] <fnagel> Selectmenu button role=combox added to wiki: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page-revisions/compare/12138056/Selectmenu?rev2=1327015996&rev1=1326995271
[13:01:11] <fnagel> Sadly without a WHY
[13:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> oh well
[13:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll contact some people and see if we can get more info.
