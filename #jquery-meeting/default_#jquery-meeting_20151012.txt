[12:00:30] <gibson042> hello
[12:00:39] <timmywil> hi markelog
[12:00:46] <markelog> hey-hey
[12:01:01] <timmywil> First up, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2584
[12:01:19] <timmywil> jaubourg's suggestion looks sufficient. agreed?
[12:01:56] <markelog> already landed )
[12:02:03] <gibson042> :)
[12:02:03] <DaveMethvin> i liked it!
[12:02:04] <timmywil> orly?
[12:02:10] <markelog> oh, you mean other ticket
[12:02:23] <timmywil> was gonna say, it's still open
[12:02:25] <markelog> yeah, i think it is good
[12:02:26] <DaveMethvin> this is the xml one
[12:02:38] <markelog> we should do the same for json and html too
[12:02:40] <timmywil> oh, that other one. yes, thank you for landing that
[12:02:45] <markelog> i can come with patch today
[12:03:12] <timmywil> markelog: cool, assigned to you
[12:03:17] <markelog> cool )
[12:03:28] <timmywil> PRs: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2465
[12:03:34] <markelog> jaubourg says, i'm just writing code :-)
[12:03:46] <markelog> didn't know about \b before
[12:04:02] <timmywil> it's handy
[12:04:14] <timmywil> on that PR, we got a resonse from Mr21
[12:04:36] <m_gol> (I need to run in moment unfortunately)
[12:04:51] <markelog> need to check it
[12:04:55] <timmywil> I was leaning towards Krinkle's version, but it looks like it's bigger now
[12:04:56] <m_gol> (for another meeting)
[12:05:01] <timmywil> what he has is probably good
[12:05:06] <markelog> don't remember to what he is referring to
[12:05:26] <timmywil> ok, maybe we can get to it during the week
[12:05:34] <DaveMethvin> this (still) looks good to me as well
[12:05:39] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2276
[12:05:45] <markelog> DaveMethvin: yep
[12:05:58] <timmywil> gibson042: I defer to you, but I'm thinking we can land
[12:06:17] <timmywil> markelog brings up a good point about it not yet being fixed in FF
[12:06:25] <DaveMethvin> sad about the size tho
[12:06:39] <markelog> as i understand it is only ff issue, if user would reset the sizes?
[12:07:05] <gibson042> only to the extent that doing so would eliminate auto margins
[12:07:06] <DaveMethvin> we're gonna talk with them this week, we can beat them about the head and shoulders on it :)
[12:07:10] <timmywil> according to gibson042, it also affects IE8 and Android, but later versions have it fixed
[12:07:26] <DaveMethvin> the Moz guys are supposed to be at our team day in NYC
[12:07:35] <m_gol> is there a bugzilla bug for that?
[12:07:35] <markelog> that is awesome DaveMethvin !
[12:07:36] <timmywil> nice!
[12:07:41] <markelog> m_gol: yeah
[12:07:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah if there's a bugzilla we should put it on our blocker list
[12:08:11] <markelog> it was referenced somewhere
[12:08:14] <m_gol> yeah, the meta "issues jQuery is working around" bug
[12:08:38] <timmywil> Lastly, jdd asked for a meeting to talk about Edge and what we can offer to improve it
[12:08:51] <markelog> so if i understood correctly we need that primarily only for FF correct?
[12:09:00] <markelog> timmywil: hooray!
[12:09:01] <timmywil> markelog: yup
[12:09:03] <DaveMethvin> he'll be there too so we can grab some time with jdd maybe over a beer
[12:09:10] <timmywil> he'll be there?
[12:09:12] <markelog> so, if we will talk with moz team
[12:09:12] <timmywil> awesome!
[12:09:15] <DaveMethvin> i thought so
[12:09:24] <gibson042> markelog: I would say primarily for Android, since we dip farther back into their history
[12:09:32] <timmywil> I'd love to schedule an in-person meeting with him then
[12:09:38] <DaveMethvin> sure
[12:09:52] <timmywil> I've started a list of things we'd like to see fixed in Edge
[12:09:56] <timmywil> in the notes
[12:09:57] <markelog> gibson042: hm
[12:10:02] <markelog> so reset wouldn't help?
[12:10:06] <timmywil> gibson042: I thought Android has it fixed now
[12:10:17] <m_gol> we should skim through all the issues that have "Support: IE 11" & add Edge where appropriate
[12:10:24] <timmywil> or, at least, that's how I read your github comment
[12:10:25] <gibson042> they do, but the release cycle is also slower
[12:10:29] <m_gol> that would tell us what's still lacking
[12:10:31] <markelog> m_gol: there is two of them right?
[12:10:48] <timmywil> m_gol: yea, I did a code/issues search
[12:10:59] <markelog> gibson042: in what version bug was introduced?
[12:11:09] <markelog> android one i mean
[12:11:27] <timmywil> but I think John is also looking for broader suggestions on what we'd like to ideally like to see in a modern web browser
[12:11:30] <gibson042> looks like 4.0
[12:11:45] <markelog> and fixed in 4.0 >?
[12:12:05] <m_gol> markelog: I see a lot of support comments that affect IE 11
[12:12:22] <m_gol> markelog: we need to check which of them also affect Edge & add it to the list
[12:12:27] <markelog> m_gol: i'm concern mostly with focusin :/
[12:12:31] <markelog> and that iframe thing
[12:12:31] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[12:12:34] <gibson042> https://github.com/gibson042/jquery/blob/gh-2237/test/unit/support.js
[12:12:37] <timmywil> m_gol: oh, sorry, I read that wrong. I only listed the ones that specifially had "Edge" in the comment
[12:12:39] <gibson042> <4.0 is good
[12:12:45] <gibson042> I think latest is also good
[12:13:00] <markelog> so, like 4.x is good?
[12:13:15] <gibson042> no, 4.0-4.3 is busted
[12:13:22] <timmywil> gibson042: oh I see, this is upstream Android?
[12:13:26] <timmywil> that has it fixed
[12:13:37] <markelog> and reset wouldn't help?
[12:14:02] <timmywil> latest = unreleased right?
[12:14:07] <gibson042> I'm still not sure what you mean when you ask if reset helps
[12:14:13] <markelog> m_gol: good idea
[12:14:24] <gibson042> if the margin is auto, then the bug presents
[12:14:26] <markelog> sounds like we need to do make that list before summit
[12:14:42] <markelog> DaveMethvin: when we schedule to meet with them?
[12:14:50] <DaveMethvin> friday
[12:14:53] <DaveMethvin> just working out the details
[12:15:03] <markelog> DaveMethvin: cool!
[12:15:10] <markelog> so we need that list before then
[12:15:11] <DaveMethvin> looks like we will be in Microsoft offices in midtown manhattan
[12:15:23] <DaveMethvin> i will send out details once they are nailed down
[12:15:26] <timmywil> markelog: agreed, but, again, if you have any suggestions that go beyond bug fixes (e.g. faster release cycles, specific esnext features, etc), that'd be good too
[12:15:36] <markelog> gibson042: there was suggestion from DaveMethvin about reset
[12:15:43] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2237#issuecomment-97281378
[12:15:58] <markelog> timmywil: okay, cool
[12:16:13] <m_gol> timmywil: a better bug tracker
[12:16:25] <timmywil> m_gol: good idea!
[12:16:25] <markelog> whats wrong with current one?
[12:16:26] <m_gol> I'd like them to not have a separate closed bug tracker
[12:16:31] <m_gol> this always suchs
[12:16:33] <m_gol> * sucks
[12:16:38] <DaveMethvin> oh for Edge, yeah
[12:16:45] <markelog> oh, for edge
[12:16:51] <m_gol> WebKit does it for most bugs and I really dislike it
[12:16:52] <markelog> i was thinking about moz
[12:16:53] <DaveMethvin> esp when they would clear the bug list on each release
[12:17:08] <m_gol> bugs that are fixed are often not closed
[12:17:13] <markelog> maybe we could talk about defaultDisplay too :-)
[12:17:15] <m_gol> in the Edge bug tracker
[12:17:16] <DaveMethvin> if edge is evergreen i hope we are beyond that sort of thing
[12:17:16] <m_gol> etc.
[12:17:20] <m_gol> lots of issues with that
[12:18:03] <markelog> bottom line, i think if bug exist in mozilla, android and ie8
[12:18:11] <markelog> that it might worth 80 bytes
[12:18:12] <m_gol> the final effect is that after reporting sth I often ping the Edge Twitter account as well or I might get no response
[12:18:30] <m_gol> markelog: Android Browser, i.e. <4.4?
[12:18:42] <gibson042> yes, I believe so
[12:18:43] <markelog> we still support it, right? :-)
[12:18:47] <m_gol> lol
[12:18:58] <markelog> we could talk about dropping it!
[12:19:00] <m_gol> just making sure what we're talking about :)
[12:19:07] <markelog> jfk
[12:19:10] <gibson042> it sounds like we're all a middling +1 on the PR
[12:19:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:19:22] <timmywil> _1
[12:19:24] <timmywil> +1
[12:19:32] <DaveMethvin> a regretful +1 i guess
[12:19:40] <gibson042> ok
[12:19:50] <m_gol> +0.30000000000000004
[12:19:54] <DaveMethvin> the fact that current FF isn't fixed pushes it more plusser
[12:19:57] <markelog> )))
[12:20:03] <timmywil> m_gol: very specific
[12:20:06] <markelog> although, we still talk about this with moz ppl
[12:20:09] <DaveMethvin> yep
[12:20:23] <timmywil> will everyone here be in NY?
[12:20:23] <markelog> man, we really need that list
[12:20:28] <markelog> i will
[12:20:36] <timmywil> m_gol, gibson042 ?
[12:20:40] <markelog> for edge and moz
[12:20:42] <gibson042> I will be
[12:20:43] <m_gol> I will
[12:20:45] <timmywil> hooray!
[12:20:46] <DaveMethvin> yay
[12:20:54] <timmywil> that'll be fun
[12:21:05] <DaveMethvin> lets get some new contribs on board too
[12:21:07] <markelog> another thing
[12:21:12] <DaveMethvin> i hope we can get some help with docs
[12:21:17] <timmywil> markelog: shoot
[12:21:19] <markelog> i wrote a letter to Paul about webkit tickets
[12:21:29] <markelog> it seems he is busy with other stuff
[12:21:36] <markelog> since i didn't get a response
[12:21:48] <markelog> is there anyone else we can contact to?
[12:21:55] <markelog> maybe addy?
[12:22:01] <m_gol> WebKit or Blink?
[12:22:05] <markelog> blink!
[12:22:11] <timmywil> don't blink
[12:22:22] <markelog> there is still bug tracker though, right?
[12:22:31] <markelog> timmywil: so addy is also out?
[12:22:40] * timmywil makes Doctor Who jokes any chance he gets
[12:22:44] <m_gol> ;)
[12:22:51] <timmywil> markelog: idk
[12:22:54] <m_gol> that was a good one
[12:23:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: any suggestions?
[12:23:02] <DaveMethvin> we know some webkit committers like mikewest, he's mostly security stuff but might be able to ping the right folks
[12:23:21] <markelog> DaveMethvin: could cc him in that letter?
[12:23:25] <timmywil> paul might at least be able to point us to someone
[12:23:32] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I assume s/webkit/blink/ in all these comments
[12:23:37] <timmywil> even if he doesn't have time to address the bugs
[12:23:50] <DaveMethvin> right, just to let them know what is blocking us
[12:23:51] <markelog> that would be cool, but that letter is old now
[12:24:05] <DaveMethvin> i have to run off in about 5 minutes
[12:24:09] <markelog> without response
[12:24:39] <timmywil> yea, we're at the end
[12:24:58] <DaveMethvin> we'll have some time to work on Friday
[12:25:02] <DaveMethvin> and play too :)
[12:25:07] <timmywil> see you all in New York!
