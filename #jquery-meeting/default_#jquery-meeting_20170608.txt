[14:04:01] <apsdehal___> arschmitz: I still don't think the api website has been updated
[14:04:10] <arschmitz> it is
[14:04:19] <arschmitz> i fixed it just this morning
[14:05:00] <arschmitz> looks like there is a lot we need to fix still
[14:05:07] <arschmitz> but it is matching whats on master
[14:08:15] <apsdehal___> Yep, it seems fixed. Just checked the listview widget
[14:08:20] <apsdehal___> It has classes options now
[14:09:50] <apsdehal___> What is the next plan of action for now? Fixing bugs in api documentation?
[14:10:14] <apsdehal___> I am also not seeing many issues for 1.5
[14:17:06] <arschmitz> yeah fix up api and any bugs and release beta
