[09:01:19] <siovene> Hello.
[09:03:30] <DaveMethvin> gnarf mikesherov rwaldron gibson042 orkel jaubourg Core meeting time!
[09:03:39] <gibson042> hey siovene
[09:03:43] <DaveMethvin> and siovene!
[09:03:43] <rwaldron> here!
[09:03:46] <orkel> hey
[09:03:50] <siovene> hei gibson042 and DaveMethvin, and all the rest
[09:03:53] <rwaldron> (gibson042... pushed!)
[09:04:17] <siovene> DaveMethvin: can I go first? I can't stay for the whole meeting.
[09:04:20] <gibson042> niiiice
[09:04:59] <DaveMethvin> siovene fire away!
[09:05:35] <DaveMethvin> so how goes the benchmarking?
[09:05:37] <siovene> DaveMethvin: okay, not too much to write home about though :-) I didn't have as much time as I hoped, in the past few weeks, but my intention for commitment stays.
[09:05:41] <siovene> I did do something though.
[09:06:09] <siovene> I set up some "unit test"-like benchmarking system using benchmark.js (the code behind jsperf)
[09:06:26] <siovene> And I made it relatively easy to get a CSV of the output.
[09:06:39] <DaveMethvin> good benchmarks are hard so if you get something started we can go from there
[09:06:58] <siovene> Now I'm thinking about whether I should split this from the jquery source tree so I can think about benchmarking different versions concurrently, altering benchmark.js
[09:07:05] <siovene> but I think this is something we can start from.
[09:07:12] <siovene> I have a patch here: https://github.com/siovene/jquery/commit/d87dfb2f1e1d4cf42905e4e1c962c4c5cc98d613
[09:07:13] <b-ot> siovene: Salvatore Iovene (2h 14m 11s): Add initial structure of performance tests based on benchmark.js.
[09:07:29] <DaveMethvin> for now sure, just keep it in a fork and we can decide where to go with it
[09:07:39] <siovene> If you clone my repo and open perftest/index.html, it will run 7 very simple, probably useless, benchmarks
[09:08:22] <siovene> I need to add the ability to run single benchmarks instead of the whole, or run single "suites" (i.e. core, deferred, ajax, and so on)
[09:09:01] <siovene> Then at least on FF and Chrome, I guess I can make the CSV output downloadable with a click (right now you must copy/paste it from a text area)
[09:09:21] <siovene> and then write a tool that compares two runs and tells you percentages for the diff
[09:09:55] <DaveMethvin> longer term it would be nice to have some way to run these in the swarm, in which case we'd probably have something that we communicated back to an enclosing page ... i dunno
[09:09:56] <siovene> then all I need is some suggestions about what kind of functions I should test, for more complex scenarios
[09:10:17] <siovene> DaveMethvin: yeah of course, then automation will come
[09:10:30] <siovene> I guess phantomjs can already run this, though I haven't tried
[09:10:53] <DaveMethvin> anyone else have thoughts on what we should do for benchmarks?
[09:12:07] <siovene> I have to go for my daughter's bath time :-) But I'll be back in an hour, so we can talk more on -dev. I just wanted to chip in quickly and tell that I've worked on it a little and I'm still committed :)
[09:12:09] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to have things that represent more real-world tests ... it's relatively easy to run .addClass() and benchmark it in isolation but it seems less useful as a benchmark
[09:12:18] <DaveMethvin> ok, great thanks siovene
[09:13:18] <DaveMethvin> btw if  i seem slower than usual, i'm using a new notebook
[09:13:23] <DaveMethvin> it's taking me a while to get used to it
[09:13:50] <DaveMethvin> and the networking drops out every few hours so if i depart suddenly i'll be back in a few minutes after rebooting
[09:14:23] <DaveMethvin> okay it looks like rwaldron and gibson042 were tweaking the data stuff for 2.0, you guys happy with that?
[09:15:01] <gibson042> I think it's looking pretty good
[09:15:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm happy
[09:15:26] <gibson042> dunno if rwaldron has lined up a publisher yet for the comments
[09:15:32] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:15:39] <rwaldron> gibson042 bwahahahaha
[09:15:45] <rwaldron> Random House showed interest
[09:15:57] <DaveMethvin> appropriate publisher imo
[09:16:07] <rwaldron> I might hold out until I can shop it around to some hollywood execs... they may want to adapt it into a tv movie
[09:16:27] <DaveMethvin> Terminator 2.0
[09:16:43] <DaveMethvin> so anything else to go into this beta?
[09:17:01] <DaveMethvin> i think the data impl should get a public test so we can be sure there aren't any issues
[09:17:12] <DaveMethvin> altho in reality few people use our betas :(
[09:17:31] <DaveMethvin> at least we can say we tried !
[09:17:55] <gibson042> we should at least get some feedback from jQuery UI folks
[09:18:13] <DaveMethvin> oh, on the data impl?
[09:18:17] <gibson042> which in this case will be highly relevant
[09:18:19] <gibson042> yeah
[09:18:37] <DaveMethvin> they run against it nightly so we should know by tomorrow what we broke
[09:19:07] <DaveMethvin> so what are we missing for 2.0 final?
[09:19:25] <DaveMethvin> anything we should be adding or changing?
[09:19:43] <orkel> I want to try tackle #10515
[09:20:02] <orkel> and tweaking some uglify-js options like for 1.9
[09:20:37] <DaveMethvin> orkel sounds good
[09:20:48] <DaveMethvin> i saw your pr from over the weekend
[09:20:56] <orkel> and?
[09:20:57] <DaveMethvin> i need to go thru and look at whats in the q
[09:21:07] <DaveMethvin> haven't gone thru it in detail
[09:21:41] <orkel> okey, no hurry
[09:21:54] <DaveMethvin> oh something i meant to ask, should we offer a querySelectorAll/matchesSelector simple stub to replace Sizzle?
[09:21:57] <DaveMethvin> as a module?
[09:22:17] <DaveMethvin> it would most likely make the size a lot smaller
[09:22:48] <DaveMethvin> probably a timmywil / gibson042 thought
[09:23:36] <DaveMethvin> to some extent it's a PR move since I suspect most people are using Sizzle extensions whether they know it or not
[09:23:39] <timmywil> ah!
[09:23:46] <DaveMethvin> but it does give people the choice
[09:24:04] <gibson042> we still patch qsA et al., so it would re-expose edge case bugs
[09:24:06] <DaveMethvin> oh and of course the situations where we fix the broken qSA
[09:24:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin am I good to go then, to squash and land Data?
[09:24:08] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:24:18] <gibson042> but that might be okay in a lot of applications
[09:24:31] <DaveMethvin> i am okay with exposing broken qSA, it reinforces the value of full Sizzle
[09:24:39] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin re: "should we offer a querySelectorAll/matchesSelector simple stub to replace Sizzle?"
[09:24:40] <rwaldron> Yes.
[09:25:05] <timmywil> I basically have one already
[09:25:13] <rwaldron> I actually have a branch, that I never actually wrote any code in...
[09:25:22] <DaveMethvin> great!
[09:25:24] <gibson042> so the concept is something like a "without Sizzle" build exclusion?
[09:25:24] <rwaldron> the branch is: "experimental-sqa"
[09:25:28] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:25:30] <rwaldron> I even spelled it wrong!
[09:25:33] <rwaldron> :D
[09:25:38] <timmywil> I can clean it up and do a branch
[09:25:41] <gibson042> yeah
[09:25:45] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron is replacing Sizzle with sql
[09:25:50] <rwaldron> gross
[09:25:58] <timmywil> select * from document;
[09:26:04] <rwaldron> OMFG.
[09:26:10] <DaveMethvin> SELECT input FROM DOCUMENT where VALUE="hello"
[09:26:18] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin re: Data... land?
[09:26:26] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron yep
[09:26:27] <rwaldron> (did you answer?)
[09:26:30] <rwaldron> awesome.
[09:26:32] <rwaldron> incoming...
[09:27:32] <DaveMethvin> so i'm not sure how to integrate the stub
[09:27:48] <DaveMethvin> it will be an optional module, not there unless you exclude sizzle
[09:28:15] <DaveMethvin> and include "selector-qsa" or whatever
[09:28:28] <gibson042> maybe at src/selector.js? (currently not in repo and created by build)
[09:28:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's just a build/plumbing thing but also we will need to restructure the unit tests
[09:29:03] <DaveMethvin> since several things are gonna break
[09:29:53] <DaveMethvin> the actual code is simple, the plumbing and unit tests are a pain :D
[09:30:12] <DaveMethvin> how bout i create a ticket for this ... who wants it?
[09:31:01] <DaveMethvin> i assume this would happen entirely in the jquery repo and not sizzle itself?
[09:31:09] <gibson042> +1 on creating the ticket
[09:31:12] <gibson042> I'll probably pick it up if no one else has by the end of the week
[09:31:18] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: yes
[09:35:31] <DaveMethvin> geez, slow trac http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13434
[09:35:34] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:36:15] <DaveMethvin> alright, on migrate i think i have that under control, just some minor cleanups to do
[09:37:17] <DaveMethvin> i don't see a lot of critical bugs in 1.9.1 so let's let it simmer for a couple of weeks at least before thinking about 1.9.2
[09:37:56] <DaveMethvin> but we definitely should be getting more conservative about fixes and if there are behavioral changes we can hold them until 1.10
[09:38:48] <DaveMethvin> so last week we talked about trying to align 1.10 and 2.0 ... are there going to be that many changes? the only thing I've see that's a big thing so far is our treatment of text nodes
[09:39:18] <DaveMethvin> and i'm still kinda  hoping we can push people into not doing $(textnode).wrap("<div>").appendTo("body")
[09:39:50] <DaveMethvin> and instead $("<div>").append(textnode).appendTo("body")
[09:40:13] <gibson042> there's a tiny bit of magic I'd like to move into customer-visible space
[09:40:42] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.9-stable/src/event.js#L306
[09:40:45] <gibson042> nothing major, though
[09:41:19] <DaveMethvin> let's just play it by ear for now, and see what the pain points are
[09:41:36] <DaveMethvin> i am still on a mission to prevent people from trying1.9 without the migrate plugin
[09:41:41] <DaveMethvin> drives me crazy when they do that
[09:41:55] <gibson042> as the string of duplicate tickets can attest to
[09:42:10] <DaveMethvin> that's another todo regarding trac
[09:42:26] <DaveMethvin> i think we need a main bug triage page that fronts for trac
[09:42:39] <DaveMethvin> perhaps a multi-step interview fomr
[09:42:40] <DaveMethvin> rorm
[09:42:43] <DaveMethvin> form
[09:42:47] <DaveMethvin> (new kbd)
[09:43:26] <DaveMethvin> so it would ask what they're trying to report and if its a docs thing send them to the api.jquery.com issue tracker
[09:44:05] <DaveMethvin> and have a spot for a jsfiddle/jsbin link, if they don't have one we put up a warning and they have to click "no really i understand the risks" :D
[09:44:06] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: great idea
[09:44:25] <DaveMethvin> i just have to figure out where we can put it and how to edit it
[09:44:31] <DaveMethvin> the page that's there is in the trac wiki
[09:46:28] <DaveMethvin> ok just a couple of tix that i noticed might need some discussion
[09:46:52] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13428
[09:47:00] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 and i were talking about this one
[09:47:46] <gibson042> ugh, yeah
[09:47:55] <DaveMethvin> jquery adding the ability to pass data for NATIVE events is a bad idea
[09:48:43] <DaveMethvin> i mean it can be done with enough code (cough, gibson042) but i don't know if it's something we want to encourage
[09:48:44] <gibson042> and right now we ignore arguments for events that leverage native handling
[09:48:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:49:15] <DaveMethvin> i'd almost prefer to document it as flakey with native events that are triggered through "trigger"
[09:49:29] <DaveMethvin> would work fine with triggerHandler tho
[09:49:33] <gibson042> the problem is that we don't make any promises about which events those are
[09:49:35] <DaveMethvin> which is often what people are trying to do
[09:49:43] <gibson042> and it changed with the release of 1.9
[09:50:26] <DaveMethvin> we've gotten just two or three issues so far and at least one of them was happy with the workaround
[09:50:37] <DaveMethvin> so i am thinking we might be able to document our way out of t his
[09:51:03] <DaveMethvin> if you're just wanting to call the handler (for example, initializing the page) use triggerHandler
[09:51:09] <gibson042> a plugin solution is also possible if we make isTrigger a bitmask
[09:51:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah and as you said it's not documented right now
[09:51:42] <DaveMethvin> although if you look on stackoverflow there are people proposing you look at it
[09:51:49] <gibson042> I know :\
[09:52:01] <DaveMethvin> as long as they treat it as truthy that code should still work
[09:52:05] <gibson042> yep
[09:52:07] <DaveMethvin> the SO folks really bug me
[09:52:29] <DaveMethvin> for solving $.browser they suggest you copy/paste the old code into yours :(
[09:52:40] <DaveMethvin> but most of that code is already very broken
[09:52:44] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[09:54:11] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13393
[09:54:52] <DaveMethvin> this is the dynamic duo of stupid focus issues with IE9
[09:55:32] <timmywil> does IE9 have document.hasFocus()?
[09:55:38] <DaveMethvin> since the .focus() trigger special event hook is looking at document.activeElement now in 1.9 we are having the same problem as Sizzle
[09:55:53] <timmywil> ah
[09:55:54] <DaveMethvin> i thought .hasFocus() was returning true
[09:55:58] <timmywil> wrong document?
[09:56:24] <DaveMethvin> well somehow it thinks it has focus, until you ask for the activeElement
[09:56:30] <DaveMethvin> and then it realizes it was wrong
[09:56:42] <timmywil> heh
[09:57:00] <DaveMethvin> maybe the outer iframe element has focus
[09:57:16] <DaveMethvin> but in any case i don't know if there is any solution short of a try/catch
[09:57:27] <DaveMethvin> same one gibson042 proposed for the other ticket
[09:57:47] <timmywil> what about iframe.document.activeElement?
[09:58:00] <DaveMethvin> i don't know that i'm in an iframe tho
[09:58:11] <DaveMethvin> oh i did think of one solution for this particular case
[09:58:17] <DaveMethvin> focus that is
[09:58:40] <DaveMethvin> oh no that was a differnet bug nm
[09:59:27] <gibson042> gotta run folks; I'll be watching email and -dev
[09:59:33] <DaveMethvin> ok well our time together is about up
[09:59:56] <DaveMethvin> if any of you have a chance, go thru the new tix
[10:00:08] <DaveMethvin> cyl in -dev
