[11:00:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz gseguin toddmparker RWhitbeck meeting time
[11:01:04] <RWhitbeck> Man it's 2PM EST already?
[11:01:11] <arschmitz> Hey all
[11:01:13] <_|Nix|_> Whee-hoo!
[11:01:16] <gseguin>  lurking
[11:01:19] <uGoMobi> agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/1prvpumXIlQSsiGHCBA_03iXrWuB6IR8mkEYSS5ps3Ag/edit?usp=sharing
[11:01:26] <uGoMobi> hi all!
[11:01:47] <uGoMobi> John and Anne can't make it this week
[11:02:06] <uGoMobi> let's start
[11:02:29] <uGoMobi> whole meeting will be about 1.4 alpha release
[11:02:56] <uGoMobi> let's look into the status of review branches etc
[11:03:14] <uGoMobi> content widget is merged
[11:03:31] <uGoMobi> but not documented yet
[11:03:37] <uGoMobi> right?
[11:03:42] <arschmitz> right
[11:03:52] <arschmitz> but i think the plan is to not document it for this release at all
[11:04:06] <arschmitz> its just internal reorganization at this point
[11:04:20] <uGoMobi> right
[11:05:04] <uGoMobi> close this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5427?
[11:05:04] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5427 by johnbender (6mon 1w ago): Navigation Refactor - Content Container Widget
[11:05:14] <arschmitz> yes
[11:05:16] <uGoMobi> and open new one at API docs for 1.5 maybe?
[11:05:47] <arschmitz> hmmm wouldnt yet because there is still work to be done before it should be public
[11:05:57] <uGoMobi> okay
[11:06:18] <arschmitz> once we decide on finalized public api then we should document it
[11:06:25] <arschmitz> but until then pretend it does not exist lol
[11:06:29] <uGoMobi> do we make separate tickets for those things that still need to be done?
[11:06:56] <arschmitz> its not a specific set its just more dev work really
[11:07:08] <arschmitz> maybe instead of closing keep ticket open
[11:07:13] <arschmitz> and just re milestone
[11:07:14] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:07:19] <arschmitz> then we can keep everything in one place
[11:07:34] <uGoMobi> done
[11:07:43] <uGoMobi> table refresh method
[11:07:54] <arschmitz> ill add a comment that its merged so there is an update on current status
[11:08:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you look into that?
[11:08:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, good idea
[11:09:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ummm ... into what?
[11:09:07] <uGoMobi> table refresh method
[11:09:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, yeah.
[11:09:20] <uGoMobi> frequent openeed a PR, right?
[11:09:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I went over the code and made some mods.
[11:09:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I brought it into a branch: table-widget-review.
[11:09:40] <uGoMobi> perfect
[11:09:52] <uGoMobi> what's the status? ready to merge?
[11:09:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wouldn't mind looking over it again before merging it.
[11:09:57] <uGoMobi> or still need work?
[11:10:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should probably each take a branch (preferably not one we created ourselves), review it, and merge it.
[11:11:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Asking each other questions in the process, until no more branches are left.
[11:11:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, so we need to get an overview of what branches are ready to be reviewed
[11:11:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think all the ones that are pushed are ready for review.
[11:12:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If anything major is missing, it will simply delay the merge.
[11:12:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, there are some branches that are not ready yet
[11:12:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh?
[11:12:16] <arschmitz> button one is not making some changes uGoMobi and i discussed earlier today
[11:12:21] <arschmitz> and ext-panels needs work
[11:12:28] <_|Nix|_> Right, true.
[11:12:35] <_|Nix|_> Any others though?
[11:12:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: where are you with flip css?
[11:12:54] <uGoMobi> that's why I want to go thru that list in the agenda
[11:13:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's put a status next to each item
[11:13:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think table-refresh is ready to merge, but it should be looked over at least one more time.
[11:13:50] <uGoMobi> that's what I am doing :)
[11:13:55] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:13:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[11:14:18] <uGoMobi> new flip switch widget
[11:14:25] <uGoMobi> I am working on that now
[11:14:41] <uGoMobi> I don't see big problems or anything so should be ready tonight
[11:15:28] <uGoMobi> the new filterable widget
[11:15:50] <_|Nix|_> I believe it is ready, but I'm kinda hoping to explore the possibility of deriving it from the textinput widget.
[11:15:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz and _|Nix|_ you both looked into that right
[11:16:09] <_|Nix|_> See if that reduces the code a bit ...
[11:16:13] <arschmitz> id like to look again
[11:16:27] <arschmitz> there was a lot of changes first time so be good to give another good once over
[11:16:28] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, me too, but only for that reason.
[11:17:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wanna try to see if there's anything to be gained by deriving filterable from textinput?
[11:17:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... instead of from the base class?
[11:17:19] <arschmitz> yeah ill take a look
[11:17:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It AMD-depends on textinput anyway.
[11:17:29] <arschmitz> why?
[11:17:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because it creates a textinput.
[11:17:40] <arschmitz> it really should no need to
[11:17:47] <arschmitz> it should be optional
[11:17:53] <arschmitz> textinput is just style
[11:18:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ...
[11:18:17] <arschmitz> so i guess there is something to look into here then :)
[11:18:20] <uGoMobi> yeah that shouldn't need the widget
[11:18:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I suppose so.
[11:18:41] <uGoMobi> only the clear button extension
[11:18:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we should separate the source of the keyword information from the code that does the filtering.
[11:19:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and then the dev can connect the textinput to a filterable.
[11:19:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and even clear button could be optional
[11:19:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not sure how we wanna break that down.
[11:19:35] <arschmitz> its just a fancy delete key
[11:19:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, we may wanna have behaviour that does something upon the user's typing.
[11:20:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That whole set/clearTimeout cycle that goes on while the user's typing could be factored out and used in both autogrow and filterable.
[11:21:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure other then that they both us delay for key strokes which does not take much there is not a lot to share there
[11:21:13] <uGoMobi> okay we can discuss this later on -dev, conclusion is that filterable needs some work
[11:21:26] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:21:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah might not be much but some
[11:21:32] <uGoMobi> there are some issue tickets with label "filter"
[11:21:55] <uGoMobi> maybe they are fixed with this new widget, maybe not
[11:22:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You wanna add a not to check those?
[11:22:05] <_|Nix|_> s/not/note/
[11:22:25] <uGoMobi> done
[11:22:29] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:22:45] <uGoMobi> collapsible (set) review
[11:22:51] <uGoMobi> that's on master?
[11:22:52] <_|Nix|_> Should be ready to go.
[11:22:55] <_|Nix|_> Nono.
[11:22:58] <uGoMobi> oh, in branch
[11:22:59] <_|Nix|_> collapsible-widget-review.
[11:23:34] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:23:46] <_|Nix|_> I think a final once-over would be good just to make sure that I didn't do anything mind-bogglingly st00pid, and/or to identify performance improvement opportunities.
[11:23:49] <uGoMobi> still need review?
[11:23:54] <_|Nix|_> I mean before mergingin.
[11:24:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i can look again
[11:24:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[11:24:48] <uGoMobi> textinput review branch has been merged by arschmitz
[11:25:04] <_|Nix|_> I'd say the same for controlgroup.
[11:25:15] <_|Nix|_> Can be merged, but should get one final review.
[11:25:19] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:25:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: checkboxradio?
[11:25:39] <arschmitz> already merged
[11:25:44] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:26:08] <uGoMobi> there are a few tickets with checkboxradio label
[11:26:23] <uGoMobi> we could see if those has been fixed
[11:26:28] <arschmitz> ill see if any are / can be addressed
[11:26:39] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:26:56] <uGoMobi> if not, we leave it for 1.4.1
[11:27:03] <arschmitz> yea
[11:27:24] <uGoMobi> button review
[11:27:39] <arschmitz> im working on changes based on what we talked about earlier
[11:27:46] <uGoMobi> right
[11:27:51] <arschmitz> mostly butting out all the special handling for button element
[11:27:55] <arschmitz> cutting*
[11:27:58] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:28:09] <uGoMobi> and renaming button to inputbutton
[11:28:24] <arschmitz> i thought you said buttoninput lol
[11:28:27] <_|Nix|_> The widget name changes?
[11:28:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yea for clarity will change it
[11:29:17] <arschmitz> will have to add a line for backcompat though
[11:29:22] <uGoMobi> anchors with data-role="button" and button elements will use buttonMarkup function
[11:29:56] <_|Nix|_> Currently <button> is not added to the buttonMarkup selector.
[11:30:01] <uGoMobi> and input type="button|submit|reset" will use buttoninput widget
[11:30:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you are right about the name
[11:30:09] <arschmitz> it is in review branch :)
[11:30:15] <uGoMobi> textinput, buttoninput
[11:30:19] <uGoMobi> consistent :)
[11:30:32] <_|Nix|_> So, shall I add button to the buttonMarkup selector?
[11:30:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz is doing that I think
[11:30:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no thats needs to be done in branch
[11:30:47] <arschmitz> and already is done
[11:30:51] <uGoMobi> right
[11:31:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait, I don't get it ... it's just changing the selector at the bottom of buttonMarkup ... why does that need to be done in a branch?
[11:31:26] <uGoMobi> the button.css file should be renamed as well and only contain CSS for input button
[11:31:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's, like "..., button"
[11:31:53] <arschmitz> because it will go crazy combined with button widget which will still run
[11:31:54] <_|Nix|_> Done.
[11:32:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see.
[11:32:04] <_|Nix|_> Understood.
[11:32:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, that shouldn't cause a conflict, AFAICT.
[11:33:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how much time do you think you need to finish button
[11:33:05] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:33:19] <arschmitz> should be done today
[11:34:01] <uGoMobi> listview widget review
[11:34:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you started with this
[11:34:18] <arschmitz> yea
[11:34:24] <uGoMobi> but I suggest to move to 1.5
[11:34:28] <arschmitz> its not as far as id like yet though
[11:34:37] <arschmitz> probably good idea
[11:34:40] <uGoMobi> I understand
[11:34:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's still missing?
[11:35:01] <arschmitz> from
[11:35:07] <_|Nix|_> listview
[11:35:22] <arschmitz> it just needs a good go through and review
[11:35:28] <arschmitz> i started
[11:35:33] <arschmitz> but have not had time to finish
[11:35:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so _destroy(), "enhanced", etc. are all in place?
[11:36:08] <_|Nix|_> _setOptions()
[11:36:22] <arschmitz> no
[11:36:27] <arschmitz> not all
[11:36:39] <arschmitz> i would not call it a reviewed widget yet at all
[11:36:45] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:36:54] <_|Nix|_> So, just like table ... out to 1.5?
[11:37:06] <arschmitz> sadly
[11:37:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP. It's all we can do.
[11:37:26] <arschmitz> every widget that moves to 1.5 hurts me a little more :(
[11:37:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nah. There're only 24 hours in a day.
[11:37:45] <uGoMobi> table overall widget review and navbar have been moved to 1.5
[11:37:57] <uGoMobi> we do the same for listview
[11:38:04] <_|Nix|_> I think so, yeah.
[11:38:27] <uGoMobi> last week we had discussion about issue-2859 branch
[11:38:50] <gseguin> did I hear my name? ;)
[11:38:59] <uGoMobi> that's querystring being removed from hash issue
[11:39:03] <uGoMobi> not yet gseguin
[11:39:11] <_|Nix|_> Right. I think the conclusion was to deprecate the stripping behaviour and follow the spec as of 1.5.
[11:39:18] <uGoMobi> but I was about to mention your name :)
[11:39:29] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:39:45] <issue-2859> 1.5 you said?
[11:39:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin = bug ?
[11:39:49] <issue-2859> noooooooooooooooooooo
[11:40:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:40:08] <_|Nix|_> issue-2859: You have been ... RELEGATED!
[11:40:57] <issue-2859> why oh why?
[11:41:19] <issue-2859> there is just the navigation tests that need to be looked at
[11:41:23] <issue-2859> the rest is working
[11:41:39] <issue-2859> and I've tested it here with out app
[11:41:44] <issue-2859> s/out/our
[11:41:44] <uGoMobi> do we follow the spec as soon as we merge that branch?
[11:41:57] <issue-2859> oh that no
[11:42:09] <issue-2859> because there is still stripping happening
[11:42:17] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:42:42] <issue-2859> but at least we honor the full hash in a <a href
[11:42:49] <issue-2859> but I see your point
[11:43:09] <uGoMobi> so we still don't know what to do with this for 1.4
[11:43:18] <uGoMobi> and 1.3.2 maybe
[11:43:44] <gseguin> you mean merge that branch into 1.3-stable?
[11:43:49] <uGoMobi> or we don't agree what should be done or not
[11:44:00] <uGoMobi> well, that was part of the discussion
[11:44:03] <gseguin> I thought the majority was against that
[11:44:10] <uGoMobi> right
[11:44:17] <gseguin> I mean the majority of me is for it
[11:44:24] <gseguin> but I don't know if that counts
[11:45:28] <uGoMobi> what I would like to know if we need to do anything for 1.4
[11:45:56] <arschmitz> gseguin: is your pr still going to work after i merged content widget
[11:45:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We do nothing for 1.4 but we indicate that the stripping behaviour is deprecated, to be removed as of 1.5 and replaced with the to-spec behaviour.
[11:46:09] <gseguin> arschmitz: I don't know
[11:46:20] <gseguin> arschmitz: it will break the nav test, that's a for sure
[11:46:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You made querystring work?
[11:46:27] <arschmitz> right
[11:46:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: sorta, I made a change so if you have a querystring in an href
[11:47:07] <gseguin> it'll continue to changePage to the sripped version
[11:47:14] <gseguin> but will change the url to the full hash
[11:47:45] <gseguin> it's not spec per se
[11:47:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: When you say "the url" you mean the location?
[11:47:53] <gseguin> yes
[11:47:57] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:48:06] <_|Nix|_> No, definitely not.
[11:48:13] <gseguin> not what?
[11:48:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Not to spec.
[11:48:30] <gseguin> true but more usable than 1.3.1
[11:48:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ...
[11:48:42] <_|Nix|_> Tough call.
[11:48:44] <gseguin> because we don't lose it
[11:48:45] <arschmitz> but do we do someting else still different
[11:48:51] <_|Nix|_> I know!
[11:48:55] <arschmitz> when we plan on changing again next version
[11:49:04] <arschmitz> it will be different in every recent version
[11:49:07] <_|Nix|_> We apply your PR, but we still deprecate the behaviour.
[11:49:20] <gseguin> the stripping behavior
[11:49:25] <arschmitz> 1.2 error 1.3 strip 1.4 not strip 1.5 follow spec
[11:49:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yes.
[11:49:37] <arschmitz> that seems a little insane to me
[11:49:39] <uGoMobi> good point arschmitz
[11:49:49] <gseguin> what do you propose arschmitz?
[11:49:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't think it matters as long as 1.5 follows spec.
[11:49:57] <gseguin> 1.4 follow spec ?
[11:50:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: we dont have time for that
[11:50:11] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nono ... need at least one deprecation cycle.
[11:50:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think it matters
[11:50:16] <gseguin> then I like your plan
[11:50:31] <arschmitz> i would lean towards nothing until we are going to do it right
[11:50:35] <gseguin> the problem is stripping is even wronger than erroring
[11:50:46] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:50:49] <gseguin> at least in 1.2 there was a way around it
[11:51:49] <arschmitz> problem is we are in a whole with out a good way out because of time
[11:51:56] <_|Nix|_> May I make a crazy suggestion? Deprecate the stripping behaviour, and then factor it out into an extension, to reside in web-ui-fw. If people want it, they can still have it.
[11:52:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but that is not going to happen for 1.4
[11:52:58] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Why don't you strip as 1.3 does, but put the query string in the page's data-url?
[11:53:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Then the behaviour is identical to 1.3, but the querystring is not lost.
[11:54:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Can the querystring be added to the data that is part of pagebeforechange?
[11:55:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... to avoid generating data-url attributes that differ from 1.3.
[11:56:01] <_|Nix|_> window 2
[11:56:03] <_|Nix|_> Sorry!
[11:56:15] <gseguin> I haven't tried that
[11:56:36] <gseguin> I've applied the patch proposed in the PR to our jqm file
[11:56:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think that would be the lease invasive way.
[11:56:49] <_|Nix|_> s/lease/least/
[11:56:54] <gseguin> I can explore that
[11:57:11] <arschmitz> gseguin: cant you just consume the query string in a pagebeforechange call
[11:57:28] <gseguin> it's already gone
[11:57:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what I was saying: Supply it with the pbc options.
[11:57:41] <gseguin> that's what I was doing in 1.2
[11:57:55] <uGoMobi> can we conclude that we don't make changes for 1.4, just deprecate the stripping, and look into providing to solutions to work around the stripping?
[11:58:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: +1
[11:58:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: +1
[11:58:51] <gseguin> uGoMobi: works for me, we'll realign with stock jqm at 1.5
[11:58:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Cool!
[11:59:19] * gseguin is switching to jqmobi
[11:59:33] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You mean Intel Application Framework?
[11:59:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: surprised they have no gobbled you up yet for that
[12:00:04] <uGoMobi> for the record... no changes in 1.4, deprecate the stripping, for 1.5 we make changes so we follow specs, we look into providing workarounds for the stripping for 1.3/1.4
[12:00:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nah ... on the contrary.
[12:00:36] <uGoMobi> ok, last but not least... external panels
[12:00:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IAF now place nicer with jQuery core.
[12:00:58] <uGoMobi> that still need some work
[12:01:27] <uGoMobi> I ran into a lot of issues when working on that
[12:01:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can't spel[sic] worth crap today ...
[12:01:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did some testing today and can't reproduce all of them
[12:02:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: would be to easy if i could :)
[12:02:38] <uGoMobi> but it's fair to say we need at least one day to finish this
[12:03:17] <uGoMobi> and I hope we can resolve everything
[12:04:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i did a bit of searching on this and have some thoughts we can discuss after meeting
[12:04:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[12:05:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: making the hiding of the URL bar optional
[12:05:25] <uGoMobi> is that something you can add easily?
[12:05:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[12:05:47] <arschmitz> very easy i have it done local just need to push to a branch and do some testing
[12:07:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see some blocker issues
[12:07:56] <uGoMobi> I added one "blocker" issue but that's not a blocker for alpha https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6167
[12:07:56] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6167 by uGoMobi (3d 9h ago): New icons: build four CSS files instead of one
[12:08:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I realized one thing.
[12:08:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For enhanced widgets, when you call _setOptions, if it does more than just DOM manip (like, if it sets internal variables based on option names) then those variables will be out of sync.
[12:09:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then I have to make a change to popup once controlgroup and/or collapsible is merged, because they contain a change to the base class that is also useful in popup.
[12:10:12] <uGoMobi> I see
[12:10:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not really following your set options issue
[12:11:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Suppose you do this: if ( options.abc !== undefined ) { this.element.addClass( "something" ); this._someInternalVariable = someValue; }
[12:11:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... inside _setOptions.
[12:12:00] <arschmitz> ok
[12:12:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If the widget is enhanced already and you don't call _setOptions the class will be there, but the internal variable will not have the corresponding value.
[12:12:52] <arschmitz> ok so thats something that should be handled as part of the else in if ( !enahnced )
[12:13:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's true. I was actually thinking that maybe the body of _setOptions() should be moved to another function that takes a flag indicating that only internal variables should be updated.
[12:14:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and then that new function gets called from both _create() and _setOptions.
[12:14:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, "sure, set options, but only internally".
[12:14:48] <arschmitz> hmm seems like its not really needed
[12:14:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... since the DOM is already up-to-date.
[12:14:53] <arschmitz> this is something fairly widget specific
[12:15:10] <arschmitz> and will generally be very simple
[12:15:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, yeah, I'm not saying this should be done in the base class or anything. Totally widget-specific.
[12:15:20] <arschmitz> oh ok
[12:15:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but it's something we need to keep in mind.
[12:15:52] <arschmitz> i think this is something that its whatever works for that widget if there is a lot of logic for a specific widget it might be worth the abstraction
[12:16:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I came across this when I was adding/removing classes in response to options.
[12:16:27] <arschmitz> ok
[12:16:37] <uGoMobi> but are those 2 tickets blockers?
[12:16:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I create a list of classes based on the current options, but before I apply them, I need to remove the old set of classes.
[12:17:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I dunno. I haven't really tested the implications of this discrepancy, so I figured it'd be safe to set as blocker.
[12:17:26] <uGoMobi> ok gotcha
[12:17:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Once collapsible and/or controlgroup are merged, the popup one can be closed almost immediately, and I can close the other one when I've looked at this option thing.
[12:18:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... which I need to do for controlgroup, collapsible, and popup (at least), but all widgets need to be checked.
[12:18:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok clear
[12:18:36] <uGoMobi> we said we would release 1.4 alpha this week
[12:18:47] <_|Nix|_> Right. That doesn't leave much time.
[12:18:57] <uGoMobi> but we need today and tomorrow for button, flip switch, and external panels
[12:19:36] <_|Nix|_> So, what to do?
[12:19:47] <arschmitz> i see three options
[12:20:08] <arschmitz> take whats done by tomorrow and release and it is what it is ....
[12:20:34] <arschmitz> wait until next week and beg forgiveness
[12:20:48] <arschmitz> or release alpha tomorrow and in a week or 2 release alpha2
[12:21:06] <_|Nix|_> I like the third one.
[12:21:24] <uGoMobi> one other option
[12:21:29] <_|Nix|_> alpha1 will give exposure, and we can still finish.
[12:21:44] <uGoMobi> release 1.3.2 tomorrow and 1.4 alpha beginning of next week
[12:22:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That doesn't give us a whole lot more time. Maybe monday.
[12:22:59] <arschmitz> hmmm.....
[12:23:12] <uGoMobi> yes I know that it won't buy us whole lot of time
[12:23:19] <uGoMobi> but I think that's a good thing
[12:23:27] <arschmitz> i think i would pick multiple alphas but its hard
[12:23:29] <uGoMobi> because there are always things we like to do
[12:23:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we should define a hard list of musts if we do it
[12:23:53] <uGoMobi> but we just discussed what really needs to be done and how much time we need
[12:24:01] <_|Nix|_> This are not really "like-to-do" things though, I don't think.
[12:24:02] <uGoMobi> I think we just did
[12:24:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:25:08] <uGoMobi> to do: finish button, flip switch, and external panels, filterable - dependancy on textinput
[12:25:20] <uGoMobi> and the two blocker tickets
[12:25:39] <arschmitz> yup and review / merge other branches
[12:25:47] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:25:52] <arschmitz> controlgroup / table refresh / collapsible
[12:26:48] <uGoMobi> is two days for reviewing reasonable?
[12:27:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think so.
[12:27:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can't imagine the ready-to-go ones being not ready-to-go.
[12:27:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, at least not major issues
[12:27:39] <_|Nix|_> controlgroup/collapsible should be a breeze.
[12:28:09] <arschmitz> flipswitch is short and simple and pretty solid i dont forsee much there
[12:28:09] <_|Nix|_> Oh, there's also dialog. It's kind of a half-review. I made the options work, but nothing else, seeing as how we're deprecating it.
[12:28:10] <uGoMobi> I have to make a changelog and write blog post with highlights
[12:28:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, neither do I... I am just fixing theming and some CSS today
[12:28:40] <_|Nix|_> I think I'll actually merge that because it's not big, and it will be deprecated from the getgo.
[12:28:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol have you ever written a book before
[12:28:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:29:04] <uGoMobi> :/
[12:29:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You'll need a contract with a publisher, editors, etc.
[12:29:39] <uGoMobi> first I have to get access to the site
[12:29:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you deploy
[12:29:53] <arschmitz> where Rwhitbeck we can just change cookbook into 1.4 - the guide
[12:29:53] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:30:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iv never done it
[12:30:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:30:28] <RWhitbeck> Funny you should say that…it's on the table to figure out what to do with it.
[12:30:42] <RWhitbeck> A reboot might be in order.
[12:30:50] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: yeah its kinda stalled and now out of date
[12:31:02] <RWhitbeck> yeah the out of date part is what sucks
[12:31:47] <uGoMobi> any objection against releasing 1.3.2 tomorrow with just the bug fixes that are in the 1.3-stable branch?
[12:31:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope.
[12:31:57] <uGoMobi> we can decide later if we do a 1.3.3
[12:32:05] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:32:06] <_|Nix|_> I vote no right now.
[12:32:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we should do 1.3.2 tomorrow
[12:32:21] <uGoMobi> I just hate it to break a promise so I want to offer something
[12:32:28] <_|Nix|_> The widgets will be too different to simply cherry-pick.
[12:32:35] <arschmitz> but i dont think we should do a 1.3.3 after 1.4 is out
[12:32:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[12:32:47] <uGoMobi> yeah think so too
[12:32:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No way we can cherry-pick any longer.
[12:32:59] <arschmitz> nope not really
[12:33:24] <uGoMobi> ok so we have a plan
[12:33:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can even mention in post that 1.4 is "coming very soon"
[12:33:59] <arschmitz> but we need a little more time to finsih up
[12:34:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Real Soon Now™
[12:34:04] <uGoMobi> yeah I will twitter something
[12:34:23] <uGoMobi> and comment on my forum post
[12:34:29] <uGoMobi> and Linkedin posts
[12:34:30] <uGoMobi> and...
[12:34:33] <uGoMobi> :(
[12:34:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I once saw a message of "Real Soon Now™" waiting on my favourite game to be released for Linux and it came out three months later.
[12:34:52] <arschmitz> yeah we suck we are sorry our ambitions were higher then our work force lol
[12:35:09] <_|Nix|_> "Patches welcome".
[12:35:20] <uGoMobi> yeah we have to do things a bit different in the future I think
[12:35:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think frequent helped out in a big way.
[12:35:25] <uGoMobi> planning-wise
[12:35:38] <arschmitz> yup
[12:35:44] <uGoMobi> but hey... we did a lottttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt of work for 1.4
[12:35:54] <uGoMobi> so no reason to be sad now ;)
[12:35:58] <uGoMobi> nice work all!
[12:36:01] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. It'll be good so see it out the door.
[12:36:03] <_|Nix|_> Agreed!
[12:36:05] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think we did any thing wrong
[12:36:23] <arschmitz> we had high hopes we did as much as we could and we will put it out close to when we said
[12:36:25] <uGoMobi> everything on master by tuesday evening?
[12:36:36] <_|Nix|_> Boo-yah!
[12:36:37] <arschmitz> really where i think we went wrong was ever giving out a public date
[12:36:37] <uGoMobi> release 1.4 alpha on wednesday?
[12:36:58] <arschmitz> ui core etc never do that
[12:36:59] <_|Nix|_> Bring it on! Bring that sucker on!
[12:37:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we first said begin July
[12:37:21] <uGoMobi> so I think we had to inform the community
[12:37:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. We learn.
[12:37:51] <uGoMobi> and I also think it's good to set deadlines for ourselves because we want so much :)
[12:38:03] <uGoMobi> talking to myself here as well BTW :)
[12:38:06] <arschmitz> yes we should just not make those deadline public :)
[12:38:08] <uGoMobi> true _|Nix|_ , we learn
[12:38:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. I mean, Fedora 19 was delayed like 3 weeks, so meh!
[12:38:47] <uGoMobi> any questions from the community?
[12:38:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and Fedora have dates set for all stages of their release cycle ahead of time.
[12:39:03] <_|Nix|_> C'mon now, don't be shy!
[12:39:14] <uGoMobi> yeah, we used to set dates for our milestones
[12:39:20] * _|Nix|_ jumps around and waves
[12:39:27] <uGoMobi> and people ask for that
[12:39:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's good, but +/- a week should be OK.
[12:39:56] <uGoMobi> yeah, we can plan on a day
[12:40:01] <uGoMobi> can't*
[12:40:10] <_|Nix|_> Alright. Let's wrap this sucker...
[12:40:11] <uGoMobi> ok let's wrap up here
[12:40:15] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[12:40:20] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[12:40:20] <_|Nix|_> To the -dev-cave!
