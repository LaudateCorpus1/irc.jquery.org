[09:01:28] <DaveMethvin> core meetin time rwaldron timmywil gnarf
[09:01:37] <timmywil> ah!
[09:01:48] <DaveMethvin> just in time, gibson042!
[09:02:04] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov will be here at 12:20, i bet
[09:02:25] <gibson042> are you talking about my arrival or my Sizzle patch? ;)
[09:02:41] <DaveMethvin> your arrival, but also appropos of the patch!
[09:03:59] <DaveMethvin> so we have quite a few blockers left, i spent some time this morning filtering through everything
[09:04:26] <DaveMethvin> the low quality of bug reports really hurts us ... need to get that form changed so people give us better info on the first try
[09:04:46] <DaveMethvin> also so i don't go postal on some of these guys :D
[09:05:09] <DaveMethvin> on whether to do an RC, i am thinking it won't help if we do
[09:05:16] <DaveMethvin> people just aren't testing them
[09:05:25] <DaveMethvin> and we have some bugs that are getting lots of dups
[09:05:30] <DaveMethvin> so a 1.8.1 would be good asap
[09:05:36] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12337 is a dup of something, maybe not 12403. Anyway, it's fixed.
[09:05:55] <DaveMethvin> even if there are some issues left, a more stable 1.8.1 woudl be nice
[09:07:13] <DaveMethvin> i think several of the remaining ones are inside sizzle, the xml markup ones are a pita
[09:07:20] <DaveMethvin> since we don't test in xml
[09:07:31] <DaveMethvin> xhtml
[09:08:20] <gibson042> that sounds about right
[09:08:27] <timmywil> we can fix the xml issue pretty easily
[09:08:28] <gibson042> I still want to resolve 12303 etc.
[09:08:59] <timmywil> agreed, I have a solution for 12303 as well.
[09:09:14] <timmywil> handlePOS can make more use of having already tokenized the selector
[09:09:21] <gibson042> yep
[09:09:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah that one is easy, the #12369 xml one for oldIE seemed tricky
[09:09:57] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I think we can just avoid dir caching in xml
[09:10:08] <timmywil> and child selector caching
[09:10:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i guess you'd have to
[09:10:24] <DaveMethvin> altho you could do it just for oldIE i guess
[09:10:34] <timmywil> hmm, true
[09:10:37] <timmywil> is it worth it?
[09:10:52] <DaveMethvin> i am not an xml fan anyway
[09:11:06] <DaveMethvin> doesn't bother me if you don't cache for any of them
[09:11:15] <DaveMethvin> and we can take that out for 2.0
[09:11:16] <timmywil> maybe it's a bigger issue if isXML is false in xhtml
[09:11:29] <DaveMethvin> i think it's true isn't it?
[09:12:19] <rwaldron> Sorry I'm late!
[09:12:24] <timmywil> not sure, I think I've run into a situation where the document element's nodeName is still HTML in xhtml
[09:12:40] <timmywil> but it's a been while
[09:13:15] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[09:13:41] <DaveMethvin> oh rwaldron could you look at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12392
[09:14:22] <timmywil> gibson042: you want to tackle the xml issue and I'll take pos in attributes?
[09:14:35] <timmywil> or other way around?
[09:14:51] <DaveMethvin> i thought i had a solution for #12392 inside jquery.clean, setting innerhtml="" which works everywhere but oldIE (of course)
[09:14:53] <gibson042> let's say other way around, I'm a little iffy on the dir caching
[09:15:03] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sure
[09:15:22] <DaveMethvin> just gotta shake off the parents, i think it is related to the shimming rwaldron
[09:15:58] * rwaldron looking
[09:16:22] <DaveMethvin> there are a couple of manipulation issues that may be related to that, the ones with .after and .before definitely are
[09:17:15] <DaveMethvin> I'll take #12384 and #12346
[09:17:23] <timmywil> gibson042: sounds good. Just a note: I'm hoping handlePOS can be a little faster by using the existing groups. My thought is that it can loop through and it only has to check PSEUDO tokens. ids, classes, tags, and attributes won't have POS within them.
[09:17:46] <gibson042> timmywil: yes, that mirrors my thinking
[09:17:50] <timmywil> cool
[09:18:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, yeah.. I just looked at this through a variety of versions and it changes between 1.3->1.4
[09:18:32] <DaveMethvin> okay, good! i think we have all the blockers assigned now
[09:18:47] <rwaldron> and then 1.6->1.7
[09:18:56] <rwaldron> (returning to the 1.3 behaviour)
[09:19:02] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i thought it changed in 1.7 -> 1.8 too
[09:19:07] <rwaldron> no
[09:19:18] <DaveMethvin> oh sorry i meant 1.6->1.7
[09:19:21] <DaveMethvin> which is what you said
[09:19:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:19:42] <rwaldron> yes
[09:19:48] <DaveMethvin> but markup created from a string defn shouldn't have a parentNode unless it's a document frag
[09:19:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: just fyi, any ff3.6 selector ticket having to do with matching custom pseudos has already been fixed.
[09:19:56] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[09:19:57] <rwaldron> right
[09:20:09] <DaveMethvin> once we release 1.8.1 we'll get rid of these pesky dups
[09:21:16] <DaveMethvin> so, just a quick run thru some of the recent bugs to get you-guys opinion
[09:21:46] <DaveMethvin> #12406 kind of brings  up the question of whether we should fix those nagging oldIE bugs that people always complain about
[09:21:52] <DaveMethvin> i can see benefit either way
[09:22:11] <DaveMethvin> we add some bytes in 1.9 for it but can say we REALLY are cross browser
[09:22:16] <DaveMethvin> double rainbow all the way
[09:22:24] <DaveMethvin> so like $("title").text()
[09:22:31] <DaveMethvin> and $("style").text()
[09:22:38] <DaveMethvin> which barf atm
[09:22:41] <DaveMethvin> in oldie
[09:23:08] <DaveMethvin> opinions?
[09:23:20] <gibson042> this will be a drop in the bucket for oldIE code in 1.9 but not 2.0; I'm +1 on it
[09:24:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's not a lot of code and might stop people from compaining :)
[09:24:39] <DaveMethvin> plus we don't have to carry it over
[09:24:49] <DaveMethvin> those are the two i could think of off the top of my head
[09:25:30] <DaveMethvin> oh and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12048
[09:25:38] <DaveMethvin> i think it's an easy fix
[09:25:46] <DaveMethvin> but it seems like it just gets you one step further into the grave
[09:25:59] <DaveMethvin> since oldIE in particular dislikes dealing with two documents
[09:26:07] <DaveMethvin> and trying to move stuff across them
[09:26:28] <DaveMethvin> which i why i keep bothering him for a real-life scenario
[09:26:33] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the test that is failing in that fiddle
[09:26:38] <rwaldron> showing a <div>
[09:26:51] <rwaldron> I just wrote a test case using that as the basis
[09:26:57] <rwaldron> testing if nodeType is 11
[09:27:03] <rwaldron> jQuery().after("<div>hello</div>")[ 0 ].parentNode
[09:27:10] <rwaldron> and it passes/
[09:27:24] <mikesherov_> .
[09:27:29] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:27:33] <mikesherov_> Oh man
[09:27:35] <DaveMethvin> i said 12:20
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> damn i lost the pool
[09:27:50] <rwaldron> one sec, that is wrong above
[09:27:51] <mikesherov_> I got deeply involved with splunk
[09:28:00] <DaveMethvin> np mikesherov_
[09:28:01] <mikesherov_> and forgot about 12:00
[09:28:08] <mikesherov_> p.s. I <3 splunk
[09:28:11] <mikesherov_> awesome tool
[09:28:21] <mikesherov_> catching up now
[09:28:35] <rwaldron> I retract everything I said above
[09:29:08] <mikesherov_> ok caught up
[09:29:13] <mikesherov_> lots of talk about selectors
[09:29:17] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i was trying to debug an issue with .after() and found that the "<p>abc</p>" case was returning a div as a parent
[09:29:29] <mikesherov_> p.s., I think we should blatantly not fix any FF3.6 bugs, but looks like they were fixed already
[09:29:30] <DaveMethvin> and it seemed to be the div that was used in jquery.clean to create it
[09:29:47] <DaveMethvin> sizzle still supports 3.6, jquery doesnt
[09:30:02] <mikesherov_> kk
[09:30:02] <DaveMethvin> i just need to write that in the next blog post
[09:30:07] <rwaldron> yeah, I'm there so far
[09:30:18] <DaveMethvin> and we need some SINGLE place to describe the browser support
[09:30:19] <mikesherov_> can I bring up a ticket, btw?
[09:30:24] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov_: sure
[09:30:33] <mikesherov_> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12243
[09:30:49] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[09:30:53] <DaveMethvin> no you can't mikesherov_
[09:30:54] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:31:18] <DaveMethvin> col is such a strange tag
[09:31:25] <DaveMethvin> useful but strange
[09:31:26] <mikesherov_> so, here's the thing
[09:31:39] <mikesherov_> we do this weird thing, where if an element is hidden
[09:31:45] <mikesherov_> and you want it's width
[09:31:54] <mikesherov_> we SHOW it, measure, and hide again
[09:32:00] <mikesherov_> which I think is bonkers
[09:32:18] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, i agree, but of course we can't change it now
[09:32:21] <mikesherov_> so, I changed it in 1.8 to only do the showing if the display:none
[09:32:47] <mikesherov_> to fix a bug when <td's> reported offsetWidth zero, we were changing to display:block
[09:33:03] <mikesherov_> so I said, only flip if offsetWidth is zero AND display is none
[09:33:15] <mikesherov_> which break almost all of the table* display types
[09:33:16] <DaveMethvin> boom goes the dynamite
[09:33:25] <DaveMethvin> damn
[09:33:26] <mikesherov_> so, what I'm thinking is...
[09:34:06] <mikesherov_> only flip it if offsetWidth 0 and display if display is none or starts with table except "table", "table-cell", or "table-caption"
[09:34:41] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:35:22] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov_: what does col return as display?
[09:35:33] <mikesherov_> table-column
[09:35:44] <mikesherov_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/display
[09:35:53] <timmywil> not in IE tho right?
[09:35:56] <timmywil> is that ok?
[09:36:01] <mikesherov_> i should know, i just updated that MDN article
[09:36:14] <mikesherov_> yes, it's fine, because i made it tilerant of that
[09:36:29] <mikesherov_> rdisplayswap = /^(none|table(?!-[ce|ca]).+)/,
[09:36:32] <timmywil> kk
[09:36:35] <mikesherov_> i think
[09:36:38] <timmywil> yummy
[09:36:43] <timmywil> <3 regex
[09:36:56] <mikesherov_> i think thats right
[09:37:04] <DaveMethvin> ugh mikesherov_ you kiss your mama with that regex? :D
[09:37:10] <mikesherov_> non
[09:37:13] <mikesherov_> no
[09:37:22] <mikesherov_> i suck at regex
[09:37:36] <gibson042> /^(none|table(?!-c[ea]).+)/
[09:37:41] <mikesherov_> sure
[09:37:53] <mikesherov_> thanks gibson042
[09:38:25] <mikesherov_> so anyway...
[09:38:31] <DaveMethvin> well it's worth a try
[09:38:38] <mikesherov_> hahaha
[09:38:44] <mikesherov_> i love trying
[09:38:57] <DaveMethvin> the whole offsetWidth "optimization" turned out to be more hassle than it's worth
[09:39:12] <DaveMethvin> it's causing reflows at times when it doesn't need to
[09:39:29] <mikesherov_> well, offsetWidth is still pretty awesome for a large portion of cases
[09:40:35] <mikesherov_> but anyway...
[09:40:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: just threw in a fix for another xhtml ticket http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12359
[09:40:48] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, I figured it out
[09:41:13] <rwaldron> somehow the collection returned ends up with two elems of the same "appearance"
[09:41:21] <timmywil> gotta run to lunch. be back laters
[09:41:32] <rwaldron> where you believe [0] is your detached node, it's really at [1]
[09:41:40] <rwaldron> I'll figure out why  in a sec
[09:42:21] <DaveMethvin> okay, looks like we got some good progress on tix here
[09:42:51] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to get 1.8.1 out on Wednesday or Thursday, seems like it's doable given what we have
[09:43:36] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov_: i'll land your svg patch, those kind of patches don't bother me
[09:43:45] <mikesherov_> k
[09:45:07] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then, i guess we're done! let's get those blockers unblocked
[09:45:15] <DaveMethvin> see you back in -dev, thanks everyone!
