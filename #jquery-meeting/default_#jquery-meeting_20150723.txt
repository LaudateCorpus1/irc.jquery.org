[11:05:42] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:05:44] <arschmitz> agenda ^^
[11:05:46] <cgack> howdy
[11:06:06] <sfrisk> yo
[11:08:07] <agcolom> hello
[11:08:30] <arschmitz> So lots of activity continuing in ui and mobile
[11:08:32] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[11:08:56] <arschmitz> the amd demos landed in ui which means their core breakup and re-org is next
[11:09:13] <arschmitz> once thats done i can submit the pr i have for us to update based on their changes
[11:10:31] <arschmitz> page classes and popup classes are fully reviewed and basicly ready to land
[11:10:44] <arschmitz> Loader needs one smallish update and i think its ready as well
[11:11:58] <arschmitz> so we are really starting to move on those
[11:12:11] <arschmitz> i think the first ones being so painful has made the rest go a lot quicker
[11:12:29] <arschmitz> being dragged out so long with so many different changes
[11:13:13] <arschmitz> cgack: re submitted toolbar and i did a review of the major updates it needs
[11:13:41] <cgack> awesome, I'll take a look and see what I can do
[11:14:19] <arschmitz> cgack: the actual classes stuff looks good
[11:14:25] <arschmitz> its mostly all the "other stuff"
[11:14:28] <arschmitz> backcompat
[11:14:34] <arschmitz> some tests stuff
[11:14:46] <arschmitz> that we were not really doing last time you updated that
[11:14:55] <cgack> cool, yeah I was afraid it had gone stale sitting for so long
[11:15:00] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, backcompat is a bigun, especially when you have extensions, and each has its own backcompat.
[11:15:38] <gabrielschulhof> Like some vaguely tably-looking widget I seem to recall ;)
[11:16:11] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:17:06] <arschmitz> UI is hoping to release their beta in 2 weeks
[11:17:17] <arschmitz> id like us to try to get an alpha as soon after as possible
[11:17:40] <gabrielschulhof> *whew*
[11:18:15] <arschmitz> oh listview
[11:18:16] <cgack> toolbar may take that long, and I haven't touched navbar in a year, but I'll give it a whirl
[11:18:23] <arschmitz> looks really good
[11:18:32] <arschmitz> i had almost no comments on it
[11:19:20] <gabrielschulhof> Listview? Did someone say listview?
[11:21:28] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah
[11:21:31] <arschmitz> it looks good
[11:21:54] <gabrielschulhof> OK, wow!
[11:22:03] <jasperdegroot> about listview ... probably need to change helper class for the icon again
[11:22:15] <jasperdegroot> to ui-widget-icon-float
[11:22:23] <arschmitz> oh you got it to work?!?!?
[11:22:24] <arschmitz> yaY
[11:22:26] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8145#issuecomment-124193627
[11:22:50] <arschmitz> thats exactly what i had in mind
[11:23:13] <jasperdegroot> that works on IE8
[11:23:25] <arschmitz> yup because first-child is good just not last
[11:23:29] <arschmitz> so you default to last
[11:23:33] <arschmitz> so thats perfect
[11:23:57] <arschmitz> do you really need to negate block?
[11:24:09] <arschmitz> shouldnt those never be used together?
[11:24:27] <jasperdegroot> yeah, good point
[11:24:39] <jasperdegroot> we can document that
[11:25:06] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:25:31] <arschmitz> i think this gets us everything we had before and more in terms of icon position flexibility
[11:25:39] <arschmitz> and in a very easy to use way
[11:26:02] <jasperdegroot> I have to see how this works out with listview count bubble
[11:26:08] <jasperdegroot> that's why I didn't do a PR yet
[11:26:16] <jasperdegroot> will wait until listview lands
[11:26:23] <jasperdegroot> in 1.5-dev
[11:26:25] <arschmitz> ok
[11:26:31] <agcolom> jasperdegroot: could you add something about this in the notes. I've got to pop out to pick up my son....
[11:26:40] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: sure
[11:26:45] <agcolom> thanks :-_
[11:26:47] <agcolom> :-)
[11:28:08] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i started testing your branch
[11:28:17] <arschmitz> i landed the update for the backcompat options
[11:28:29] <arschmitz> so i just need to rebase your branch with that and i can make sure everything looks good
[11:28:31] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:28:41] <jasperdegroot> yes
[11:29:17] <jasperdegroot> also need to rebase to get those changes regarding fieldcontain hide class
[11:29:33] <jasperdegroot> that is in 1.5-dev now
[11:29:44] <arschmitz> yeah i did that already
[11:29:54] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[11:29:59] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Is the change whereby the default ns is "ui-" already in 1.5-dev?
[11:30:05] <arschmitz> yes
[11:30:18] <arschmitz> but only when mobileBackcompat === false
[11:30:49] <gabrielschulhof> OK, then we need to rework all our PRs on top of that to use ui- in the tests instead of nstest- and to remove setNameSpace (like you suggested in my listview PR).
[11:31:04] <gabrielschulhof> So, I need to do this with popup and page and listview and loader as well.
[11:31:09] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes but you will know when you run tests
[11:31:15] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, OK.
[11:31:21] <gabrielschulhof> Trial by fire it is.
[11:31:25] <gabrielschulhof> Sink or swim.
[11:31:28] <gabrielschulhof> Do or die.
[11:31:29] <arschmitz> because if you have backcompat false its going to fail every test
[11:31:37] <arschmitz> if you have not done those
[11:32:03] <gabrielschulhof> Nice!
[11:32:07] <arschmitz> sorry i should have mentioned that on those 2
[11:32:12] <gabrielschulhof> NP.
[11:32:15] <arschmitz> its a simple search and replace trivial change
[11:32:31] <arschmitz> the more complicate are things like slider
[11:32:39] <arschmitz> where you need to also add a data role
[11:32:46] <arschmitz> but you can still do it with a search and replace
[11:34:34] <arschmitz> 3rd party demos landed
[11:34:40] <arschmitz> so we have prettier demos now
[11:35:00] <arschmitz> if any one has ideas for good integration demos for 3rd party stuff brainstorm and sit on them
[11:35:07] <arschmitz> and post alpha id like to add more
[11:35:07] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: are you going to force push the 1.5-css-and-demos branch?
[11:35:27] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah might as well no need for both of us to rebase it
[11:35:30] <arschmitz> and fix the conflicts
[11:36:00] <jasperdegroot> I can do it but thought you said you already did rebase against 1.5-dev
[11:36:10] <arschmitz> yes i did thats what i meant
[11:36:15] <jasperdegroot> ok great
[11:36:17] <arschmitz> i already did it so no need for you to do it too
[11:36:21] <jasperdegroot> thanks
[11:37:02] <arschmitz> as far as 3rd party i have plans to make a handlebars and hammer.js ones
[11:37:27] <jasperdegroot> handlebars?
[11:37:41] <arschmitz> templateing system
[11:37:51] <arschmitz> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[11:38:10] <jasperdegroot> ah
[11:38:29] <jasperdegroot> is that same as mustache?
[11:38:36] <arschmitz> its an extension of it
[11:38:47] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:38:56] <arschmitz> https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js#differences-between-handlebarsjs-and-mustache
[11:40:04] <arschmitz> im a big fan and it would be really easy to integrate with JQM
[11:40:54] <arschmitz> especially with the enhanced option
[11:42:54] <jasperdegroot> about the demos
[11:43:06] <jasperdegroot> the custom CSS needs some attention
[11:43:18] <jasperdegroot> or maybe the markup
[11:43:32] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:43:40] <jasperdegroot> of things like the quick view buttons, search button, etc.
[11:43:50] <arschmitz> thats markup
[11:43:58] <jasperdegroot> yeah probably
[11:43:58] <arschmitz> we have started fixing them in the prs
[11:44:05] <arschmitz> need to add spaces
[11:44:13] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, I noticed the search panel is blank. Might've just been dreaming.
[11:44:31] <arschmitz> and at some point a search and replace someone did went wrong and moved some icons out of their buttons
[11:44:36] <jasperdegroot> I think this has to wait until all PRs landed
[11:44:51] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[11:44:56] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah i think i saw that and figured the problem out just need to look again
[11:45:04] <jasperdegroot> it will probably mostly be search and replace work
[11:45:04] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: are those the issues your talking about?
[11:45:32] <jasperdegroot> among others, yes
[11:45:51] <arschmitz> im sure there is some custom css that still needs attention
[11:45:56] <arschmitz> but i know i saw those issues a lot
[11:46:04] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:46:08] <arschmitz> in the popup and page pr reviews
[11:46:19] <arschmitz> ok so accordion
[11:46:25] <arschmitz> sfrisk: you still around?
[11:46:27] <jasperdegroot> let's just wait until all PRs landed
[11:46:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: agreed
[11:46:34] <jasperdegroot> and then check everything
[11:46:34] <sfrisk> hello
[11:46:38] <arschmitz> accordion
[11:46:41] <sfrisk> I saw I have some things to fix in accordion
[11:46:48] <arschmitz> yeah its a good start though
[11:46:59] <arschmitz> a few things need discussion
[11:47:06] <sfrisk> Should be easy enough to fix the changes listed
[11:47:40] <arschmitz> yeah the changes are pretty simple but i would like to discuss a few things
[11:47:48] <arschmitz> like a non inset styled one
[11:47:56] <arschmitz> also header grouping
[11:48:38] <sfrisk> sure, can do
[11:48:41] <arschmitz> does any one have thoughts on these
[11:48:44] <arschmitz> should we do them?
[11:48:48] <jasperdegroot> I think inset should become a generic thing for grouped buttons
[11:48:58] <jasperdegroot> with a ui-inset class
[11:48:58] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok
[11:49:07] <jasperdegroot> we can use it for accordion and listview
[11:49:15] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[11:49:21] <jasperdegroot> maybe in a later version make it work with controlgroup
[11:49:49] <arschmitz> a non inset controlgroup sounds like a nav bar lol
[11:50:00] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:50:04] <jasperdegroot> but can be vertical too
[11:50:14] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:50:18] <jasperdegroot> like a non-inset vertical group of checkboxes
[11:50:24] <arschmitz> i wonder iv navbar should be a controlgroup extension?
[11:50:48] <jasperdegroot> I haven't looked at the navbar review for a while
[11:50:53] <arschmitz> that adds all the fancy grid functionality
[11:50:59] <jasperdegroot> doesn't that widget use a bit more logic
[11:50:59] <arschmitz> cgack: thoughts?
[11:51:07] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: a lot more
[11:51:29] <arschmitz> the new nav bar adds a bunch more functionality actually
[11:51:40] <cgack> I move away from using grid in the navbar review
[11:51:45] <jasperdegroot> maybe it become more complicated if it is an extension
[11:52:08] <arschmitz> cgack: what are your thoughts in looking at if this could just be a controlgroup extension?
[11:52:37] <arschmitz> that way you limit your scope to just the manipulation logic?
[11:52:49] <jasperdegroot> cgack: do you use table CSS for navbar?
[11:52:59] <cgack> arschmitz: my thoughts are that I can look into that if we think it has a benefit
[11:53:08] <arschmitz> cgack: perfect
[11:53:19] <arschmitz> if you dont think it make sense thats fine
[11:53:40] <arschmitz> there is just enough potential visual similarity id like us to at least consider the possibility
[11:53:42] <jasperdegroot> I think there are lots of differences in both JS and CSS even though it are both grouped buttons
[11:53:49] <cgack> jasperdegroot: I think i use table layout IIRC
[11:54:14] <jasperdegroot> yeah, looking into it won't harm
[11:54:28] <arschmitz> back on accordion
[11:54:41] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: mentioned the display vs visibility
[11:54:58] <arschmitz> and i mentioned there is also opacity which has some perf benefits
[11:54:59] <jasperdegroot> for page that is
[11:55:04] <arschmitz> yes
[11:55:24] <jasperdegroot> yeah, saw your comment
[11:55:59] <arschmitz> the one case i can think of we may want to not do this
[11:56:05] <jasperdegroot> this is the ticket we are talking about: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8137
[11:56:06] <arschmitz> is when the initial page is hidden
[11:56:24] <arschmitz> because that does not go away a split second later
[11:57:23] <arschmitz> this could be a real win with the default transition too
[11:57:29] <arschmitz> since its fade which is also opacity
[11:57:58] <arschmitz> a lot less layouts and paints durring the transition process
[11:58:18] <arschmitz> i think my frist test will just be to change it and run tests
[11:58:20] <jasperdegroot> I am not sure if I understand what you mean by "because that does not go away a split second later"
[11:58:31] <arschmitz> so normally pages are removed when they are hidden
[11:58:39] <arschmitz> all expect the first page
[11:58:46] <arschmitz> unless you set cache true
[11:58:50] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:59:01] <jasperdegroot> or a prefetched page
[11:59:03] <arschmitz> so the potential for issues with them recieving events they should not is very very limited
[11:59:05] <arschmitz> yes
[11:59:18] <gabrielschulhof> Nono.
[11:59:35] <arschmitz> so im going to change to opacity:0 and see if things blow up in the tests because of stray events
[11:59:36] <gabrielschulhof> Just because a page is removed from the DOM doesn't mean its event listeners will never fire.
[12:00:08] <arschmitz> this should not be a problem
[12:00:20] <arschmitz> because we DO ALLOW cacheing prefetching multi page layout etc
[12:00:49] <arschmitz> so any case where events could cause issues should already happen
[12:00:54] <jasperdegroot> yeah, should be a problem already
[12:01:21] <arschmitz> i just need to run the transitions page through a bunch of devices
[12:01:27] <arschmitz> to see if anything happens there too
[12:01:59] <arschmitz> this would fix some issues with textarea too
[12:02:07] <arschmitz> and we could try to apply this to panel for that too
[12:02:30] <arschmitz> but one step at a time
[12:02:45] <jasperdegroot> also need to test IE8
[12:02:53] <jasperdegroot> with filter
[12:02:58] <arschmitz> yup
[12:03:12] <arschmitz> OHH
[12:03:21] <arschmitz> big importnat topic i promissed we would dicsuss
[12:03:26] <arschmitz> android 2.3 support
[12:03:31] <arschmitz> and not supporting it in 1.5
[12:03:51] <arschmitz> core is pushing to drop it in 3.0 which is already in alpha
[12:03:58] <jasperdegroot> its marrket share dropped from huge to almost nothing
[12:04:00] <arschmitz> or at least move it to compat
[12:04:19] <arschmitz> yes
[12:04:41] <jasperdegroot> although that is based on adroid play store data
[12:04:43] <cgack> the sooner we drop support, the sooner i can drop it at <dayjob> :)
[12:04:44] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2483
[12:05:41] <arschmitz> so heres the thing with android support
[12:05:48] <arschmitz> for most things we basicly do what the vendor does
[12:05:55] <arschmitz> we drop ie when microsoft drops ie
[12:06:16] <arschmitz> chrome and firefox are evergreen so we do current -1
[12:06:46] <jasperdegroot> we have to look at our CSS vendor prefixes
[12:06:50] <arschmitz> even apple has firm suppot drops like core is dropping ie6 since apple did ( so we should too )
[12:07:02] <arschmitz> but google does not do this with android
[12:07:17] <arschmitz> in fact they dont do updates for the webview for anything older then 4.3
[12:07:22] <arschmitz> which is like half od users
[12:07:31] <arschmitz> not even critical security ones
[12:07:43] <arschmitz> but they still update the 2.3 media player :-)
[12:07:49] <jasperdegroot> hmm
[12:08:06] <arschmitz> and play store supports back to 2.2
[12:08:37] <arschmitz> much of the issue here is around hybrid aps
[12:09:18] <jasperdegroot> and I guess manufacturers don't update phones to newer android versions because they want you to buy a new one?
[12:09:43] <arschmitz> part of me is tempted to say by the time we hit final its so close to end of they year and with numbers to just have 1.5 not support ie8 or android 2.3 lol
[12:09:55] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: you can still buy brand new off the shelf 2.3 phones at bestbuy
[12:10:06] <jasperdegroot> yeah i know :(
[12:10:08] <arschmitz> the largest electronics retailer in the us
[12:10:32] <arschmitz> so what are others thoughts
[12:10:38] <arschmitz> what do we support in 1.5
[12:10:48] <arschmitz> sfrisk: gabrielschulhof: cgack:
[12:10:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: if you stop back
[12:11:03] <arschmitz> apsdehal2: arthurvr:
[12:11:05] <jasperdegroot> I still think we should try to support as many Android versions
[12:11:41] <jasperdegroot> but if core drops support for 2.3, we can't officialy support it either
[12:11:43] <cgack> I guess if you can buy it at a major retailer we should do some sort of support
[12:12:01] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec ... we can just go passive on the whole thing.
[12:12:12] <arschmitz> yes
[12:12:13] <gabrielschulhof> If we get no 2.3-specific bugs, well, all's good with the world.
[12:12:25] <gabrielschulhof> If we do, and we track it back to core, we'll be like *shrug*
[12:12:39] <arschmitz> core has agreed to still support in compat and make compat support hybrid ( it currently does not )
[12:12:42] <arschmitz> if thats what we want
[12:12:44] <gabrielschulhof> We can always recomment that they use an older core.
[12:12:56] <arschmitz> and to do basic smoke testing on master
[12:13:04] <arschmitz> so in theory nothing changes in either lib
[12:13:10] <jasperdegroot> using older core doesn't sound like good recommendation
[12:13:14] <arschmitz> no
[12:13:29] <arschmitz> im not a fan of that
[12:14:28] <arschmitz> ok so lets vote
[12:14:32] <arschmitz> no support
[12:14:35] <arschmitz> passive support
[12:14:39] <arschmitz> or full support
[12:14:59] <jasperdegroot> for android 2.3 only?
[12:15:01] <arschmitz> yes
[12:15:10] <jasperdegroot> passive support
[12:15:19] <arschmitz> oh also
[12:15:21] <arschmitz> if passive
[12:15:25] <arschmitz> passive via compat
[12:15:28] <arschmitz> or passive on all
[12:15:49] <jasperdegroot> via compat
[12:16:00] <jasperdegroot> still try to fix small bugs
[12:16:05] <arschmitz> to be clear
[12:16:14] <arschmitz> passive via compat means we still full support in mobile
[12:16:24] <arschmitz> but in core they only support officially on compat
[12:16:29] <arschmitz> but change compat to allow hybrid apps
[12:16:58] <gabrielschulhof> Well, if we don't get too many bugs, the difference between passive and official is not too big.
[12:16:59] <arschmitz> smoke testing only on master
[12:17:07] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes
[12:17:16] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: do you recall the last 2,3 bug
[12:17:18] <arschmitz> becuase i dont
[12:17:26] <jasperdegroot> neither do I
[12:17:45] <gabrielschulhof> Don't ask me. I don't recall what I did yesterday.
[12:17:46] <cgack> i'm okay going passive
[12:17:48] <arschmitz> im +1 for full passive
[12:18:00] <arschmitz> we dont remove anything until 1.6
[12:18:17] <arschmitz> and let core do whatever they like and support on compat or not up to them
[12:18:21] <jasperdegroot> ok +1 for full passive too
[12:18:54] <arschmitz> sfrisk: agcolom: apsdehal2: ?
[12:19:05] <sfrisk> Sorry, work happened
[12:19:08] <sfrisk> catching up
[12:19:56] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof:
[12:21:47] <sfrisk> +1 for passive
[12:22:16] <gabrielschulhof> I'm all for passive.
[12:22:20] <arschmitz> ok
[12:22:23] <arschmitz> thats it then
[12:22:35] <arschmitz> the passives have it
[12:22:44] <jasperdegroot> :)
[12:22:45] <arschmitz> ( how often do you hear that lol )
[12:22:52] <jasperdegroot> lol
[12:23:03] <arschmitz> the passive people never win lol
[12:23:14] <arschmitz> ok we are way over
[12:23:22] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: like I said ... we have to review vendor prefixes in the CSS
[12:23:23] <arschmitz> so lets call it a wrap unless anyone has anything else?
[12:23:32] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: well we wont change anything
[12:23:34] <arschmitz> until 1.6
[12:23:41] <jasperdegroot> I mean in general
[12:23:48] <jasperdegroot> we now support FF 10+
[12:23:50] <arschmitz> gotcha
[12:24:05] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: we should use autoprefixer
