[11:03:05] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:03:10] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:03:13] <gseguin> Hello
[11:03:13] <JasonDScott> Hello
[11:03:15] <toddparker> the jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:03:23] <toddparker> hey JasonDScott - long time!
[11:03:34] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:03:46] <toddparker> this will be a quick rundown
[11:03:49] <toddparker> agenda
[11:03:50] <toddparker> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzitW2VunzGXRwbJDYvTZwqc6-u1tScBl1xC2Szm3sw/edit#
[11:03:54] <JasonDScott> Toddparker: Yes it has
[11:04:16] <toddparker> we're going to do some prioritization on the roadmap after this
[11:04:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... in -dev?
[11:04:45] <toddparker> my updates
[11:04:55] <toddparker> we'll decide there _|Nix|_
[11:05:07] <toddparker> * 1.2 status - fixed few small issues, ready for RC next week
[11:05:09] <toddparker> * Bump up core support to 1.8 for next 1.2 release - now in place
[11:05:09] <toddparker> * Starting work on roadmap prioritization
[11:05:33] <toddparker> bender?
[11:05:45] <johnbender> so
[11:05:51] <johnbender> the XSS bug should be addressed
[11:05:57] <johnbender> but
[11:06:03] <johnbender> everyone needs to knwo that you can't use location.href
[11:06:06] <johnbender> anywhere
[11:06:07] <johnbender> :(
[11:06:25] <toddparker> with that fix in place?
[11:06:36] <johnbender> $.mobile.path.getLocation()
[11:06:39] <johnbender> use that instead
[11:06:43] <toddparker> that seems…like a big change
[11:06:50] <johnbender> ?
[11:06:58] <johnbender> we don't use location.href in that many places
[11:07:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is this something we can push to core?
[11:07:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no
[11:07:25] <toddparker> does this mean that anyone's code that uses location. href is impacted
[11:07:26] <johnbender> routing isn't core's job
[11:07:30] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[11:07:36] <johnbender> if they care about android 2.3
[11:07:41] <johnbender> did anyone get my basecamp post?
[11:07:47] <toddparker> and that wasn't the case before this change?
[11:08:00] <johnbender> toddparker: not sure what you mean?
[11:08:23] <johnbender> anyone using location.href that puts the url into markup could be vulnerable to xss
[11:08:26] <johnbender> yes
[11:08:34] <johnbender> jqm or otherwise
[11:08:42] <toddparker> ok, we'll just have to do a good job educating folks on this
[11:08:52] <johnbender> I would add it to the 1.2 blog post
[11:08:59] <johnbender> we can colab on the details
[11:09:03] <toddparker> i see the risk for sure
[11:09:05] <toddparker> yeah
[11:09:11] <johnbender> other than that I'm working on bugs
[11:09:14] <toddparker> mind adding this to the docs under the ajax nav stuff
[11:09:15] <johnbender> looking at base tag support
[11:09:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is there an issue about this?
[11:09:18] <johnbender> that will go in a branch
[11:09:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes
[11:09:22] <toddparker> i'll copy that into the blog post
[11:09:34] <toddparker> ok on that branch
[11:09:43] <toddparker> any other changes queued for 1.2?
[11:09:57] <johnbender> nope
[11:10:06] <johnbender> just that and the navbar issue
[11:10:09] <toddparker> if not, i'll start working on the change log and blog post for RC1
[11:10:16] <toddparker> right, that seems pretty light
[11:10:20] <toddparker> ok
[11:10:30] <gseguin> what about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3771
[11:10:31] <gseguin> ?
[11:10:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4787
[11:11:33] <toddparker> gseguin: not sure the collapsible is critical enough but i can be overruled
[11:11:50] <johnbender> gseguin: I think that should wait for a refactor to a proper widget
[11:11:56] <johnbender> 1.2.1 imo
[11:12:00] <gseguin> agreed but in that case the doc change should be pulled out
[11:12:02] <johnbender> at the earliest
[11:12:03] <toddparker> +1
[11:12:11] <toddparker> gseguin: looks like you've been on download builder business
[11:12:33] <gseguin> I have indeed
[11:12:45] <toddparker> and...
[11:12:46] <toddparker> Resuscitated $.support.touch as $.mobile.support.touch
[11:13:04] <toddparker> like having public support tests. i know these are used a lot
[11:13:08] <gseguin> a couple users have filed a few bugs which are addressed now but will show only in 1.2.rc.1
[11:13:38] <toddparker> ok
[11:13:44] <gseguin> that's it
[11:13:46] <toddparker> more reason to get rc 1 out
[11:13:48] <toddparker> cool
[11:13:54] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: wanna go
[11:14:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Sorry - yeah.
[11:15:02] <_|Nix|_>     Dunno how to fix WP7 scrolling problem (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4784)
[11:15:05] <_|Nix|_>     Fixed navigation issue (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4806)
[11:15:08] <_|Nix|_>     Can we close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4493? (Deep linking in multi-page document fails when the query string contains a period)
[11:15:12] <_|Nix|_> So, I dunno how to fix the WP7 scrolling.
[11:15:29] <toddparker> that wp7 bug is pretty bad. i'd like to try and fix that up
[11:15:31] <_|Nix|_> It seems to always go back to the same value when you dismiss a popup, no matter where the page was scrolled to.
[11:15:39] <toddparker> maybe wilto or uGoMobi will have ideas
[11:15:48] <_|Nix|_> Please! I need the help!
[11:15:54] <toddparker> heh, ok
[11:15:57] <uGoMobi> is it 7 or 7.5?
[11:16:02] <toddparker> let's get you help thne
[11:16:06] <uGoMobi> or both? :)
[11:16:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No idea. How do I check?
[11:16:11] <toddparker> thanks for fixing that nav issue
[11:16:20] <toddparker> on 7.5 for sure
[11:16:24] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:16:28] <toddparker> uGoMobi: do you have one?
[11:16:35] <uGoMobi> no :D
[11:16:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have a Nokia Lumia 800 out-of-the-box - no updates, unless M$ installs some behind my back - which, come to think of it, it did when I first fired up the phone,.
[11:16:45] <uGoMobi> but will see if I can reproduce on IE8
[11:16:47] <toddparker> can you repro on ie9?
[11:17:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I haven't actually tried the desktop.
[11:17:42] <uGoMobi> I can try... assigne me
[11:17:46] <uGoMobi> assign*
[11:17:53] <_|Nix|_> The only other thing I have is my wondering about whether we can close the funky-URL issue (4493) ... johnbender?
[11:18:00] <toddparker> i'll have wilt look too
[11:18:05] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:18:20] <toddparker> johnbender: can you review that issue and make a call?
[11:18:44] <toddparker> ok uGoMobi - wanna go
[11:18:49] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:18:50] <johnbender> toddparker: I think we need to address it as a bug honestly
[11:18:58] <toddparker> fair enough
[11:19:07] <toddparker> doesn't seem like a 1.2 thing, right?
[11:19:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: has he posted a jsbin?
[11:19:12] <uGoMobi> did some triage and small css fixes
[11:19:12] <uGoMobi> for one css bug we don’t know the right way to fix it yet: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4813
[11:19:12] <uGoMobi> created PR for Opera transitions: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4830
[11:19:21] <johnbender> toddparker: yah it's probably ok to push of to 1.2.1 methinks
[11:19:36] <johnbender> it's a piece of the user feedback we were looking for
[11:19:39] <uGoMobi> about 2nd point... that's the bottom glow
[11:19:46] <toddparker> on 4813, i want to wait and mull that over
[11:19:54] <toddparker> so not for 1.2 but maybe 1.2.1
[11:19:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:20:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For 4493? I think in the original post.
[11:20:10] <toddparker> on the opera stuff, i can't see transitions working, do you uGoMobi
[11:20:14] <uGoMobi> about Opera transitions... looks like they always fall back to fade
[11:20:25] <toddparker> yeah?
[11:20:33] <toddparker> seems like a lot of code weight to get fade
[11:20:43] <uGoMobi> haha.. yeah
[11:20:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: oh we're not addressing that yet
[11:20:52] <uGoMobi> so let's not pull anything yet
[11:20:58] <toddparker> agreed
[11:21:00] <johnbender> I think we wanted to rebuild nav a bit
[11:21:05] <uGoMobi> I thought it was same issue as with Chrome
[11:21:07] <toddparker> opera doesn't show an error currently, right?
[11:21:14] <uGoMobi> the 3D test issue
[11:21:18] <toddparker> so it's not much different
[11:21:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there's a plugin for it anyhow
[11:21:28] <toddparker> chrome on linux and some pc's
[11:21:30] <toddparker> mac is fine
[11:21:34] <uGoMobi> no I landed a quick fix for that
[11:21:40] <toddparker> depends on how it reports the feature
[11:21:44] <toddparker> thought so
[11:21:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arg, I keep speed reading thiese issues
[11:21:46] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:21:54] <toddparker> JasonDScott: wanna go
[11:21:56] <uGoMobi> anyway... I tested just now without fallback
[11:21:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm not sorried about that particular use case just yet
[11:22:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we'll address it eventually though
[11:22:12] <toddparker> uGoMobi: and it's ok?
[11:22:13] <JasonDScott> Sure
[11:22:18] <uGoMobi> no :(
[11:22:26] <uGoMobi> so will give it another look
[11:22:31] <toddparker> hrm, let's discuss offline
[11:22:32] <uGoMobi> that's it for now
[11:22:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I just figured what with the new $.mobile.path helpers ... but OK.
[11:22:47] <JasonDScott> About to release the BlackBerry 10 theme for JQM
[11:22:51] <toddparker> WOO HOO
[11:22:51] <JasonDScott> Getting back up to speed with the project after being away.
[11:22:57] <toddparker> welcome back
[11:23:09] <toddparker> can't wait to see the final theme…we going to get a preview?
[11:23:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you mean getLocation?
[11:23:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[11:23:32] <JasonDScott> I can try to get you a preview
[11:23:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: addressing a security vuln is different than supporting an odd query param syntax
[11:23:46] <johnbender> err
[11:23:48] <johnbender> query param value
[11:23:51] <JasonDScott> Looked into - jQuery Mobile breaks jQuery.serializeArray() by including submit button (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3925 ): This seems to be intentional in the code.
[11:24:35] <JasonDScott> This seemed odd to me that we were intentionally doing this
[11:24:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's also path.parseLocation() which is supposed to avoid using decoded URLs.
[11:24:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's more the one I was thinking about.
[11:24:58] <toddparker> JasonDScott: you wanted to ask wilt about that?
[11:25:02] <toddparker> wilto
[11:25:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct, the issue here is much more complex
[11:25:21] <toddparker> is that who did that?
[11:25:24] <JasonDScott> wilto was the last one in that area
[11:25:32] <toddparker> ok, i'll ping him
[11:25:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: periods are a permitted character in params but we're using them to select directly
[11:25:46] <johnbender> that's a tough issue to solve :/
[11:25:59] <johnbender> or tougherish
[11:26:14] <JasonDScott> but he just modified it, the original code is about 2 years old
[11:26:20] <uGoMobi> just had a quick look but doesn't it have to do with jQuery's serialize requires a name attribute?
[11:26:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Right ...
[11:26:55] <toddparker> i think wilt or scottjehl will be able to answer that
[11:27:00] <toddparker> ok, that's it
[11:27:03] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Core does not serialize type=submit
[11:27:16] <toddparker> any community questions before we wrap up?
[11:27:49] <gseguin> 30 min, that sets a record!
[11:27:57] * johnbender claps
[11:28:08] <_|Nix|_> So, now, on to prioritization, right?
[11:28:11] <toddparker> yep. trying to hustle
[11:28:14] <toddparker> yep
[11:28:31] <toddparker> but let's do the first cut in a dev capacity and wrap up here
[11:28:44] <toddparker> alright, thanks everyone!
