[12:01:32] <fnagel> hey
[12:01:38] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> I was hoping to have a bunch of time to work on stuff this past week, but alas I had no time :-(
[12:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> I should have time this week though.
[12:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> Wrapping up some stuff at work.
[12:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel sent a PR to fix the numpad problem with selectmenu
[12:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15031
[12:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1732
[12:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> That has been merged :-)
[12:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that, the big news is that site deployments are working again.
[12:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks Krinkle!!!
[12:07:54] <arschmitz> yay
[12:08:22] <fnagel> good news!
[12:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I don't really have much else to discuss today, other than "work on failing tests if you have time" :-)
[12:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything to discuss today?
[12:17:57] <arschmitz> no
[12:18:23] <fnagel> no
[12:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today then.
[12:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
