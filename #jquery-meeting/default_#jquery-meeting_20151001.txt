[09:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy. Not many people here.
[09:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> Let's wait a few minutes and see if anyone else shows up.
[09:03:59] <jdalton> sup
[09:04:34] <rodenic> hi people
[09:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> hey jdalton
[09:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Hi rodenic
[09:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> jdalton: Based on s
[09:05:31] <rodenic> I'm looking for a way to contribute to jQuery. I'm products manager for a company that develope software for banks involving accessibility. We use jQuery a lot
[09:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> snover's response, I guess we need to manually add the extra steps in that test.
[09:06:23] <jdalton> cool!
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> rodenic: This is a meeting specifically for PEP. Please join #jquery-dev.
[09:06:34] <rodenic> ok thanks! regards
[09:07:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go through all the tests again to make sure that we don't have this problem in any of the other tests either.
[09:08:26] <jdalton> doesnt explain why the test passes though
[09:08:36] <jdalton> if anything they should fail
[09:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should check the test itself. It's probably not handling some scenarios.
[09:09:39] <jdalton> but more explicit is like dessert
[09:09:57] <jdalton> (there's always room for more)
[09:10:29] * jrossi9billion is hungry now
[09:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> You're working on more tests, right?
[09:14:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did you get a chance to look into vacuumTouches? https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/219
[09:16:44] <jdalton> Ya, I'll pr them (for realz this time)
[09:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> I know there are a LOT to go through.
[09:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> Should we tweet asking for help with them?
[09:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, moving on...
[09:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> The chorded buttons PRs both landed(W3C and PEP).
[09:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> There was an issue reported with our npm package: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/223
[09:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> Turns out the dist/ directory wasn't being published.
[09:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer has a PR to fix that: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/224
[09:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz pointed out that it still needs to include the src/ directory.
[09:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's all we need to do.
[09:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to pushing out a new release as soon as this lands?
[09:28:23] <jdalton> Sounds good
[09:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> That's all I've got for today.
[09:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:31:49] <gtjrossi> +1 to a release
[09:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess that's all for today.
[09:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[11:20:00] <sfrisk> Mobile Meeting Time!
[11:20:04] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz, sfrisk, cgack, apsdehal, jasperdegroot, agcolom, cgack, and anybody else I may have forgotten
[11:20:07] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:20:17] <gabrielschulhof> Did I leave anyone out?
[11:20:26] <cgack> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/
[11:21:18] <sfrisk> My availability is little iffy during the meeting today, I am in the middle of a work meeting
[11:21:33] <cgack> I can kick it off. I submitted a first PR for navbar yesterday and arschmitz started review, nothing else to report
[11:21:42] <gabrielschulhof> Cool!
[11:21:48] <gabrielschulhof> ... and while I'm talking ...
[11:21:59] <gabrielschulhof> I made a bit of progress on the selectmenu PR.
[11:22:25] <gabrielschulhof> I realized that I can't really use the theme extension for non-native, because the theme option is propagated to child widgets, rather than child elements.
[11:22:43] <gabrielschulhof> Like toolbars, listviews, popups, pages, etc.
[11:23:12] <gabrielschulhof> So, you basically call .popup( "option", "theme", newValue ) whenever there's a _setOption() for "theme".
[11:23:21] <gabrielschulhof> ... rather than using the theme extension.
[11:23:30] <gabrielschulhof> That's about as far as I've gotten.
[11:23:43] <gabrielschulhof> I'm endeavouring on keeping the tests green at every step.
[11:23:47] <jasperdegroot> I continued to work on issues in the demos
[11:24:14] <jasperdegroot> nothing special to report
[11:24:23] <jasperdegroot> I wanted to ask about the status of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8197
[11:24:32] <jasperdegroot> the accordion PR
[11:24:43] <jasperdegroot> but I see sfrisk just left
[11:24:57] <jasperdegroot> I thought it was good to land but don't see thumbs up
[11:25:19] <jasperdegroot> once that PR landed I can update the menu in our demos
[11:25:30] <gabrielschulhof> Looks like it needs another round.
[11:25:42] <gabrielschulhof> Last swing seems to be sfrisk doing an update.
[11:25:53] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:26:09] <jasperdegroot> status in the agenda says that it is good to land though
[11:26:26] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ...
[11:26:48] <cgack> well I'll trust GH over the agenda
[11:27:09] <jasperdegroot> will check with sfrisk and arschmitz later
[11:27:13] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:27:19] <cgack> +1
[11:27:29] <gabrielschulhof> +1
[11:27:40] <jasperdegroot> that's it for me
[11:28:05] <agcolom> I have a question from arthurvr
[11:28:38] <gabrielschulhof> What's up?
[11:29:51] <agcolom> arthur was asking whether we should wrap this into an htmlentities() call or is there anything that prevents us from doing that?
[11:29:55] <agcolom> here's the link
[11:30:10] <agcolom> http://api.jquerymobile.com/resources/results.php?choice=%3Cimg%20src=http://i.imgur.com/W57wiZ0.jpg%3E
[11:30:22] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/resources/results.php#L23
[11:30:42] <agcolom> I have no idea so thought I'd ask you
[11:30:48] <arschmitz> Any one still here had some internet issues
[11:31:01] <jasperdegroot> we are here
[11:31:03] <cgack> arschmitz: we are!
[11:31:34] <agcolom> he's mentioned someone mentioned it (XSS issue)
[11:33:05] <arschmitz> yeah there is a issue there we are blindly injecting user submitted content
[11:33:12] <gabrielschulhof> Woah ...
[11:33:17] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Where's that?
[11:33:27] <arschmitz> in agcolom  link
[11:33:39] <arschmitz> we are doing $_REQUEST[ 'choice']
[11:33:42] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, yeah, I know, but I dunno where in the code we're doing it.
[11:33:51] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, server-side.
[11:33:55] <arschmitz> yes
[11:33:58] <arschmitz> thats php
[11:34:03] <agcolom> yes php
[11:34:09] <gabrielschulhof> OK, gotcha.
[11:34:32] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah then definitely needs escaping.
[11:35:01] <arschmitz> yup someone could make a link that puts arbitrary content into the api site
[11:35:14] <agcolom> wow :(
[11:35:28] <cgack> should we take this off of the publicly logged channel
[11:36:04] <arschmitz> no we just need to fix it. because this is in an iframe there is not much risk in reality
[11:36:04] <gabrielschulhof> ... better yet. Let's fix it ASAP.
[11:36:38] <arschmitz> its not like you could do it within the api site wrapper only directly to the page agcolom linked
[11:38:02] <agcolom> Do we have a volunteer for the change or can someone tell me what change to make?
[11:38:06] <gabrielschulhof> Well, the fix is easy enough.
[11:38:09] <gabrielschulhof> I can do it.
[11:38:16] <agcolom> oh thanks gabrielschulhof
[11:38:29] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: What's the procedure? PR against master, and cherry-pick to 1-5?
[11:38:42] <arschmitz> yes
[11:38:43] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[11:39:12] <agcolom> also, we need to cherry-pick another commit... let me find it...
[11:39:32] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: what's the status of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8197?
[11:40:01] <arschmitz> just needs t land
[11:40:25] <jasperdegroot> do you still need to review last updates?
[11:40:26] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[11:40:26] <jasperdegroot> can you give it a thumbs up
[11:40:28] <jasperdegroot> ?
[11:40:54] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/2c07018a365089d2f3f79ba09a27872f382ff563
[11:40:57] <arschmitz> yup
[11:41:27] <jasperdegroot> ok thanks
[11:42:12] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: for example this is the sort of thing that could be done http://api.jquerymobile.com/resources/results.php?choice=%3Cimg%20src=%22http://www.technomag.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Youve_Been_Hacked.jpg%22%3E
[11:42:50] <arschmitz> http://api.jquerymobile.com/resources/results.php?choice=%3Cb%3Ethis%20is%20not%20from%20the%20page%20we%20injected%20this%3C/b%3E
[11:42:55] <arschmitz> or even script tags
[11:43:20] <arschmitz> so this is urgent to fix
[11:44:57] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/385
[11:44:57] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i dont think that fix does what we want
[11:45:10] <gabrielschulhof> No?
[11:45:39] <arschmitz> where are we posting to that page from
[11:45:40] <arschmitz> ?
[11:45:47] <jasperdegroot> i guess this is more something for the dev channel
[11:45:52] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, definitely.
[11:45:59] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: did you have any topics you wanted to discuss?
[11:46:15] <arschmitz> i think i had something with navbar
[11:46:17] <arschmitz> just a sec
[11:46:32] <arschmitz> oh 2 things
[11:46:46] <arschmitz> 1 does / should navbar support multiple lists within it
[11:46:53] <arschmitz> and should it support nested lists
[11:47:06] <cgack> you mean multiple "more button" lists
[11:47:07] <cgack> ?
[11:47:08] <arschmitz> 2 should it create button widgets or css buttons
[11:47:20] <arschmitz> like should either of these be valid markup
[11:47:53] <arschmitz> <div data-role="navbar"><ul></ul><ul></ul></div> or <div data-role="navbar"><ul><ul></ul></ul></div>
[11:48:35] <gabrielschulhof> You must mean <ul><li><ul></ul></li></ul> in the latter.
[11:48:42] <jasperdegroot> I think we shouldn't support nested lists
[11:48:45] <arschmitz> yes sorry
[11:48:52] <gabrielschulhof> This borders on menu.
[11:48:56] <gabrielschulhof> ... if we do.
[11:49:12] <arschmitz> i dont think we should support either case
[11:49:30] <jasperdegroot> yeah I agree
[11:49:35] <gabrielschulhof> +1
[11:49:35] <cgack> so then go back to grid for multiple rows, or am i missing the point here
[11:49:40] <arschmitz> n
[11:49:41] <jasperdegroot> was bit in doubt about two sibling lists
[11:49:41] <arschmitz> no
[11:49:53] <jasperdegroot> but let's not make it more complicated than needed
[11:49:55] <arschmitz> cgack: the only change for you
[11:50:09] <arschmitz> <ul></ul>
[11:50:14] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8297/files#diff-cdd2a2763328cb478b02dddea8bfcbacR119
[11:51:27] <arschmitz> the navbar should now oonly wver have one child
[11:52:43] <arschmitz> and it should be a list
[11:52:49] <arschmitz> unless im missing something
[11:52:50] <cgack> okay
[11:52:52] <jasperdegroot> regarding the buttons; I think we should just use CSS buttons
[11:52:56] <cgack> i'll give it a whirl
[11:53:18] <cgack> jasperdegroot: just add ui-button to them then? and not call .button()
[11:53:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats what i was leaning towards
[11:53:32] <arschmitz> cgack: its a bit more then that
[11:53:41] <jasperdegroot> yeah, just add the classes to it
[11:53:53] <arschmitz> we will either need to require they supply the markup ready to go
[11:53:56] <jasperdegroot> i think that's better from performance point of view
[11:54:03] <arschmitz> or we need to potentially create icons and such
[11:54:09] <jasperdegroot> yeah, with an enhance option
[11:54:23] <jasperdegroot> enhanced*
[11:54:35] <cgack> so just manually add the button css classes and not call the whole widget
[11:54:47] <jasperdegroot> that's what I suggest
[11:55:02] <arschmitz> but how do we know what classes to add
[11:55:10] <arschmitz> i think we either need to call the widget
[11:55:11] <arschmitz> or
[11:55:21] <arschmitz> we need to add none and make them supply ready to go buttons
[11:56:20] <cgack> "supply ready to go buttons".... as an option?
[11:56:47] <jasperdegroot> I think we should only do that as "enhanced" option
[11:56:55] <jasperdegroot> to be consistent with other widgets
[11:56:59] <arschmitz> no i mean we cant enhance the buttons with js unless we use the button widget because we dont know if they shoud have icons or their theme or things like that
[11:57:22] <jasperdegroot> but what is the difference with using the widget
[11:57:24] <arschmitz> so its basiclly all or nothing
[11:57:30] <jasperdegroot> then we don't know what options to set
[11:57:41] <arschmitz> we use data attributes
[11:58:07] <arschmitz> if we do that in navbar well then we are re-writing basiclly all of button with in navbar
[11:58:31] <jasperdegroot> maybe we should take one step back ... what does the new navbar support in terms of setting options for each button?
[11:59:13] <arschmitz> at the very least the all the icon options
[11:59:22] <jasperdegroot> yeah I see your point, we shouldn't include the button widget in the navbar widget just so we don't have to call the button widget
[11:59:47] <arschmitz> so we either need to make the user supply 100% ready to go markup
[11:59:48] <jasperdegroot> ok but how does a user set those options?
[11:59:52] <arschmitz> or always call the widget
[12:00:13] <arschmitz> if we always call the widget then the widget handles it
[12:00:18] <jasperdegroot> with data- attributes on each button element?
[12:00:24] <jasperdegroot> or list item
[12:00:32] <cgack> I'm thinking as a user, when I call navbar I don't want to know all the workings for button and iconpos
[12:01:02] <arschmitz> @cgack so you think we should always call the widget?
[12:01:14] <cgack> from a user standpoint yes
[12:01:33] <arschmitz> so there is a semi third option
[12:01:36] <cgack> but from the extra milliseconds it might cause at render I vote (meh)
[12:01:56] <arschmitz> the way you have this right now its in an extension point
[12:02:02] <arschmitz> we can document that extension point
[12:02:06] <gabrielschulhof> It's funny ... this is exactly why we had .buttonMarkup() before.
[12:02:22] <gabrielschulhof> So we needn't make a button widget but still know exactly what classes to apply.
[12:02:25] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah and i think that was a mistake
[12:02:38] <arschmitz> it should be all or nothing its a widget or it isnt
[12:02:46] <arschmitz> not its kinda widget ish
[12:03:18] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, especially after I added the ability to update the classes based on options by calling .buttonMarkup() again on the same element :)
[12:04:08] <gabrielschulhof> TBH though it did server to unify the way we were creating buttons within the framework. It just should never have been made public.
[12:04:12] <gabrielschulhof> serve
[12:04:20] <arschmitz> no
[12:04:30] <arschmitz> i dont think it should have existed at all its confusing for users
[12:04:33] <cgack> So should we just keep the button widget for now and  think about it for a week and remove the sibling <ul>s
[12:04:34] <arschmitz> it looks like a widget
[12:04:37] <arschmitz> it inits like a widget
[12:04:43] <arschmitz> but is missing all the widget methods
[12:04:53] <gabrielschulhof> It shouldn't've been made available to users at all.
[12:05:02] <gabrielschulhof> But there's no way to do something private in JS.
[12:05:06] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: but even not available if we use it
[12:05:15] <arschmitz> people will try to run widget methods on the buttons
[12:05:17] <arschmitz> and get errors
[12:05:27] <arschmitz> because all they see is they had a button
[12:05:30] <gabrielschulhof> Well, anyhoo ... it's gone now.
[12:05:31] <arschmitz> it inited like a button
[12:05:41] <arschmitz> it has the classes for a button
[12:05:46] <arschmitz> but its not a button
[12:06:01] <arschmitz> if we leave the widget
[12:06:32] <arschmitz> to remove the widget is super easy for a user
[12:06:43] <arschmitz> _makeNavButton: $.noop
[12:06:59] <arschmitz> now it will just tkae what you supply for markup
[12:07:24] <gabrielschulhof> We should then make it a public method ...
[12:07:31] <arschmitz> not publich
[12:07:38] <arschmitz> a documented extension point
[12:07:49] <jasperdegroot> ok I changed my mind now I realize each button needs icon settings and I agree with cgack we should use button widget
[12:08:09] <cgack> and note that if they noop it will do nothing on destroy unless they extend that
[12:08:14] <arschmitz> ui has many of these
[12:08:38] <arschmitz> cgack: there would be nothing to do on destory there in that case
[12:09:43] <cgack> right on
[12:12:55] <jasperdegroot> I have to go
[12:12:57] <jasperdegroot> later all
[12:13:04] <gabrielschulhof> L8R
[12:13:07] <cgack> later jasperdegroot
[12:14:52] <cgack> so I think I'll leave the button widget for now until further discussion/thinking
[12:15:07] <cgack> we can revisit at the dev summit if we haven't resolved by then
[12:16:21] <arschmitz> i think thats it for this week it seems
[12:16:41] <gabrielschulhof> Cool! Cya in -dev!
[12:16:48] <cgack> later
[12:18:08] <arthurvr> Bye everyone.
[12:27:10] <agcolom> ok, I'll close..
[12:27:15] <agcolom> see you in -dev
