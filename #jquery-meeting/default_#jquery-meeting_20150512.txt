[10:01:29] <sfrisk> `chassisteam
[10:01:39] <arthurvr> hey there
[10:01:43] <sfrisk> bah, that still doesn't work
[10:01:43] <arschmitz> hi'
[10:01:58] <geekman-rohit> hey!
[10:01:58] <sfrisk> disappointment fills my life
[10:02:04] <geekman-rohit> no bot eh
[10:03:56] <sfrisk> nope, bot apparently died
[10:04:46] <sfrisk> Sorry one sec, almost got the agenda ready to go
[10:04:55] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:06:42] <sfrisk> Okay so first up, I created the issues we discussed last week
[10:07:35] <sfrisk> included the base styling for <progress> as well as the div based approach for a JS fallback for both <progress> and <meter>
[10:07:48] <sfrisk> a Visual Scroll Indicator, based on discussions regarding tables
[10:08:02] <sfrisk> and converting SCSS comments to Valid CSS comments
[10:09:13] <sfrisk> If someone wants something to do, #80 could easily be grabbed I think
[10:09:16] <arthurvr> if you didnâ€™t already that should probably be in the SCSS style guide ticket as well.
[10:09:24] <sfrisk> same with #78
[10:09:37] <sfrisk> Yeah, I'm going to add a note in the SCSS style guide about it
[10:09:44] <arthurvr> okay
[10:10:16] <sfrisk> which I have now done
[10:11:53] <sfrisk> If no one grabs them before next meeting, I'll probably get to them after my current issues I'm working on
[10:11:54] <arthurvr> thx
[10:12:48] <geekman-rohit> I'll give #80 a shot
[10:12:53] <sfrisk> awesome, geekman
[10:13:09] <geekman-rohit> if it doesnt go well, sfrisk can take it up?
[10:13:18] <sfrisk> Yeah
[10:13:29] <sfrisk> the div fallback at least shouldn't be too hard
[10:13:38] <sfrisk> and if you want, I have some good reference links for progress/meters
[10:13:53] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[10:14:36] <sfrisk> In that case, I might have the currently open Meter PR be based on Meter styling only, and keep the div fallback in the realm of #80, just so the fallback is consistent
[10:15:04] <arschmitz> i think this should all be one PR and one component more or less
[10:15:27] <geekman-rohit> I agree with arschmitz
[10:15:54] <sfrisk> so <meter> <progress> styling together? Or put the meter fallback into the realm of the current <meter> issue
[10:16:16] <arschmitz> meter / progress / and the div based versions should all be one
[10:16:44] <sfrisk> well I know noufal was working on the styling for <meter>, is noufal around?
[10:17:15] <arschmitz> i dont care who does it but it should all be done together
[10:17:52] <arschmitz> and since meter has fairly low support levels it should not be the "base"
[10:18:29] <geekman-rohit> arshmitz I don't understand the reference? "base"?
[10:18:45] <sfrisk> noufal created a base styling for <meter> (#71)
[10:19:02] <sfrisk> the current PR for that is a few different classes for meter
[10:19:09] <arschmitz> all 3 things here meter, progress, and div based version are all essentially the same thing
[10:19:26] <arschmitz> so they should all use the same styling
[10:19:33] <arschmitz> so there is a "base" style
[10:19:42] <sfrisk> although I don't think there is a base meter styling in that PR currently, beyond width/height and a box shadow
[10:20:08] <arschmitz> any differences between progress/ meter should build off that base style
[10:20:24] <arschmitz> but meter should not be our basis because its the least supported
[10:20:44] <geekman-rohit> hm understood
[10:21:20] <sfrisk> also do we want the demo to include when to use <meter> vs <progress> at all?
[10:22:06] <sfrisk> Well, we can either add onto the current meter PR to include <progress> and the <div> version
[10:22:13] <arschmitz> since the difference is purely semantic i dont think we should
[10:22:43] <sfrisk> or treat the <meter> one as not being base styling, but "flavors" of meter, since noufal created a few different bars for the meter
[10:23:19] <arschmitz> personally i think we should close the current pr
[10:23:21] <arschmitz> and open a new one
[10:23:28] <sfrisk> since the PR is mostly different meter bars that are either a solid color, multiple shades of the chassis blue color, or white/blue alternate
[10:23:28] <arschmitz> by whoever is going to do it
[10:23:57] <arschmitz> i dont think the current PR is the approach we want and has numerous other issues
[10:24:07] <sfrisk> I'm inclined to agree . . .
[10:24:12] <arthurvr> yeah me too
[10:24:50] <sfrisk> I could update the new issue to include <meter> base styling, and close the current <meter> base styling issue that was created
[10:24:56] <geekman-rohit> I'll get a new PR started if thats OK
[10:25:01] <arschmitz> i think that would make sense
[10:25:07] <geekman-rohit> later this week
[10:25:15] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll put that on my todo list
[10:25:22] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: you may want to read https://css-tricks.com/html5-progress-element/
[10:26:28] <geekman-rohit> again , what is the timeframe expected?
[10:26:48] <arschmitz> i think we need this by christmas?
[10:26:56] <arschmitz> give or take a few months lol
[10:27:10] <geekman-rohit> nope seriously though coz i am travelling this week
[10:27:27] <arschmitz> in other words i think this is so low priority i dont think any one should worry about it until after v1
[10:27:37] <geekman-rohit> wow cool!!
[10:27:48] <geekman-rohit> I'll have a PR started then
[10:27:50] <arschmitz> others may disagree though
[10:28:14] <geekman-rohit> as long as I can start working more on this next week, I am good!!
[10:28:34] <sfrisk> yeah, meter is pretty low priority, since it's really gonna be needed for part of the work this summer
[10:28:43] <sfrisk> when we're doing the UI stuff
[10:29:00] <arschmitz> even for that id say its like one of the lowest priority components
[10:29:07] <arschmitz> to ui and mobile
[10:29:15] <geekman-rohit> yip, but progress bar is important
[10:29:20] <sfrisk> Okay, so I was gonna talk table styling, but michealarestad isn't here
[10:29:24] <geekman-rohit> ?
[10:29:28] <arschmitz> this like tabs, accordion, dialog etc are all more important
[10:30:07] <sfrisk> although it is a fun warm up your CSS engines type PR
[10:30:47] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, yes!
[10:34:32] <sfrisk> hrmm okay
[10:35:03] <sfrisk> so we have 3 style guide issues that need to get worked on
[10:35:14] <sfrisk> I don't think slayslot is around?
[10:35:21] <sfrisk> I know slayslot was going to work on the html one
[10:36:29] <sfrisk> I haven't really heard any updates on that, so if anyone wants to work on style guides, those are up for some good old fashion writing
[10:36:44] <sfrisk> also  we have the three performance PRs
[10:37:25] <sfrisk> which I think we decided last week that we're going to have local files, and maybe tweak how we're doing performance testing (appending vs scrolling)
[10:37:41] <arschmitz> yeah i have not had any time for that
[10:42:02] <sfrisk> no worries
[10:42:06] <sfrisk> michaelarestad!!
[10:42:22] <michaelarestad> woo! Hi from Boston!
[10:42:35] <michaelarestad> Coyier is right in front of me
[10:42:47] <sfrisk> You're so close!
[10:42:52] <arthurvr> hey michaelarestad :)
[10:44:03] <michaelarestad> hi! (sorry, semi-distracted)
[10:46:47] <kristyjy> if you guys want help with style guides I can take a stab at the SCSS one
[10:47:49] <sfrisk> Sure that would be great
[10:48:10] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/41
[10:48:21] <sfrisk> there's the issue for it, and some of the notes we've already made on it
[10:48:31] <kristyjy> great thanks! :)
[10:48:43] <sfrisk> We're looking for something kinda in this style: https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/css/
[10:49:15] <sfrisk> And I think it was decided to just commit it as an .md to the repo, probably in a folder called style guide, since it's a style guide specific for our project
[10:52:46] <kristyjy> okay sounds good
[10:55:34] <sfrisk> okay, anything else to talk about?
[11:00:12] <sfrisk> Okay, gonna call this chassis meeting to a close
[11:00:21] <sfrisk> see you all in css-chassis
