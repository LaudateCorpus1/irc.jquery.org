[09:03:11] <arschmitz> jdalton: you are still waiting on his review for your PR's right?
[09:03:36] <jdalton> ya
[09:03:56] <jdalton> though I havent spent time on it this week
[09:04:04] <arschmitz> Ok
[09:05:07] <arschmitz> I know Jacob was planning on landing the WP test for #195
[09:05:23] <arschmitz> but since i have not seen any update there guessing that has not happened yet
[09:06:28] <arschmitz> I think the only other thing right now is updating to using the style attribute which i have still not had time for
[09:07:10] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else
[09:11:24] <arschmitz> i will take that as a no
[09:11:49] <jrossi1> I missed your first comment... I assume it was "anything to discuss?"
[09:11:53] <arschmitz> yup
[09:12:20] <jrossi1> nothing much from my end
[09:12:30] <arschmitz> jrossi1: did the WP test get landed?
[09:12:42] <arschmitz> i had not seen it but could have missed
[09:12:58] * jrossi1 hides tail between legs
[09:13:35] <arschmitz> jrossi1: its ok no one else did anything this week either :-)
[09:13:45] <arschmitz> jrossi1: and ill be gone next week in Costa Rica
[09:15:02] <arschmitz> Actually talking about PEP at a conference
[09:16:51] <jrossi1> nice!
[09:19:25] <arschmitz> So i think ill call it a day unless someone has anything else
[09:19:42] <jdalton> word
[11:06:31] <arschmitz> meeting time!
[11:06:43] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: agcolom: cgack: sfrisk:
[11:06:44] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[11:06:47] <arschmitz> apsdehal1:
[11:06:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot:
[11:06:50] <sfrisk> hi
[11:06:52] <cgack> howdy
[11:07:01] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:08:02] <arschmitz> Ok lets get started
[11:08:21] <arschmitz> Button recieved another round of review
[11:08:30] <arschmitz> but its being blocked on a jscs update in ui
[11:08:56] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: any update on listview
[11:09:03] <gabrielschulhof> I just bumped it.
[11:09:06] <gabrielschulhof> Should be OK now.
[11:09:23] <gabrielschulhof> I made the changes you asked for and, surprisingly, they did not cause it to unravel :)
[11:09:31] <arschmitz> yay
[11:09:37] <gabrielschulhof> Yep :)
[11:09:46] <gabrielschulhof> Only table and panel remain.
[11:09:54] <arschmitz> what did i ask for again lol
[11:09:57] * gabrielschulhof grabs his pickaxe and oxygen mask
[11:10:27] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: To remove the backcompat from the tests, and replace nstest- with ui-
[11:10:35] <arschmitz> ah right
[11:10:54] <arschmitz> ok ill review that again but it should be good
[11:10:58] <agcolom> hey :-)
[11:11:40] <arschmitz> cgack: i just gave toolbar the :+1:
[11:11:58] <arschmitz> which leaves you with just navbar correct?
[11:12:07] <cgack> rock on! I started cherry-pick'n navbar onto 1.5-dev this AM
[11:12:49] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:12:51] <cgack> then i'll do the classes stuff and make a PR for both the review and classes stuff all in one
[11:13:09] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:13:16] <arschmitz> we are getting REALLY CLOSE!
[11:13:23] <arschmitz> I have the massive breakup and re org all green
[11:13:36] <arschmitz> just need to clean it up a bit and ill open PR with it
[11:14:44] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: when you have time i have a bunch of PR pending review still
[11:14:58] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[11:15:04] <gabrielschulhof> I'll check out your PRs.
[11:15:12] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: oh you may have missed for collapsible tests failing on 1.8
[11:15:18] <arschmitz> we decided to drop 1.8 last week lol
[11:15:26] <gabrielschulhof> Excellent!
[11:15:46] <arschmitz> since 3.0 is already in beta
[11:15:53] <gabrielschulhof> Dang! Wow!
[11:15:56] <gabrielschulhof> Moving fast.
[11:16:11] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no really 2.0 was release same time as 1.4 lol
[11:16:38] <gabrielschulhof> I remember it like it was yesterday. The grow up so fast!
[11:16:42] <gabrielschulhof> They
[11:17:02] <sfrisk> lol
[11:17:16] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[11:17:56] <arschmitz> sfrisk: you are waiting for a review on accordion right?
[11:18:10] <sfrisk> correct
[11:18:47] <arschmitz> ok apsdehal1 i dont think is here
[11:18:59] <arschmitz> still waitiign on an update to the bootstrap pr for tests
[11:19:28] <arschmitz> i think thats being blocked by an issue in one of our testing tools though
[11:20:08] <arschmitz> ok i have been trying to get through upgrade guide and API updates
[11:20:20] <arschmitz> im kinda doing them in sync since they are pretty much all the same updates
[11:20:30] <arschmitz> so be expecting many PR's on the API soon
[11:20:57] <arschmitz> im concentrating on the global stuff and button / checkboxradio / controlgroup
[11:21:07] <arschmitz> for api
[11:21:35] <arschmitz> THERE ARE SOOO MANY CHANGES lol
[11:21:36] <jasperdegroot> what did we decide about API documentation of UI widgets?
[11:21:47] <jasperdegroot> I remember we discussed that long time ago
[11:21:52] <arschmitz> well we originally decided to just point to ui
[11:21:58] <arschmitz> but at least for 1.5
[11:22:01] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:22:03] <arschmitz> we have a totally different api
[11:22:10] <arschmitz> so thats not really possible
[11:22:18] <arschmitz> because we still have the 1.4 api on top
[11:22:35] <jasperdegroot> complicated
[11:22:46] <arschmitz> so i think we just need to ignore ui for now
[11:22:51] <agcolom> I'll be happy to review your updates arschmitz
[11:22:53] <arschmitz> and update our api
[11:23:01] <agcolom> you can just ping me when ready
[11:23:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: will do im sure you will see the PR's too
[11:23:51] <arschmitz> i think for users it will be too complicate to say for this option look at mobile but for this option look at ui
[11:24:00] <arschmitz> its not like with tabs where there is no api difference
[11:24:45] <jasperdegroot> yeah, that's probably not a good idea
[11:25:26] <arschmitz> yeah we can revist once things are a little more sorted in 1.6 i think
[11:25:49] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:26:09] <arschmitz> ok so download builder
[11:26:22] <arschmitz> iv been trying to get mobile up and running on ui download builder with out any luck
[11:28:15] <arschmitz> so i talked rxaviers about it yesterday
[11:28:27] <arschmitz> and there was some misunderstanding about the state of the UI Download builder
[11:28:36] <arschmitz> it is not ready for us to use yet
[11:29:08] <arschmitz> So we went over what need to get done to get it there are will try to get that done
[11:29:49] <arschmitz> But this brings up the question is download builder a blocker for beta? Because we can no longer use our builder on the 1.5-dev branch
[11:30:01] <arschmitz> we already updated the headers for the ui builder
[11:30:25] <jasperdegroot> is it a blocker for 1.5 in general?
[11:30:33] <arschmitz> yes
[11:30:34] <jasperdegroot> how bad would it be if we postpone to 1.6?
[11:30:41] <arschmitz> we cant
[11:30:49] <arschmitz> our builder is non function on our current code
[11:30:51] <jasperdegroot> i don't know how much work there needs to be done, so i am just asking
[11:31:07] <arschmitz> well we dont have any working builder for 1.5 right now
[11:31:10] <jasperdegroot> even not if we revert those header changes?
[11:31:34] <arschmitz> nope
[11:31:36] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:31:41] <arschmitz> because the css comments map to ui css
[11:31:47] <arschmitz> that does not exist
[11:32:12] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:32:13] <arschmitz> their builder allows them to be mapped with a require.config
[11:32:39] <arschmitz> odly enough it uses our builder to do that
[11:32:58] <arschmitz> but and update that we dont support
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> so no matter what its going to be a bunch of work to get us on a working builder again
[11:34:00] <cgack> i'd lean towards voting that no download builder is not a blocker for a beta, but we'd def. need at least one beta version that has a working download builder before release
[11:34:38] <jasperdegroot> yeah or an RC
[11:34:47] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thoughts?
[11:35:00] <jasperdegroot> did we even consider doing an alpha with so many changes?
[11:35:10] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Regarding the DB?
[11:35:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes
[11:35:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: the difference is technical we can do either or both
[11:35:33] <gabrielschulhof> When I (briefly) looked into it a while back I also found it to be highly UI-oriented.
[11:35:48] <arschmitz> there is no real difference between an alpha and a beta
[11:36:00] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes
[11:36:04] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: i think there is
[11:36:21] <jasperdegroot> in beta you don't change API anymore, if i am not mistaken
[11:36:46] <arschmitz> you can
[11:36:47] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Well, then, alpha is basically "here, grab master now".
[11:37:02] <gabrielschulhof> Well, know, wait.
[11:37:05] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: You got a point.
[11:37:50] <gabrielschulhof> Alpha is indeed "grab master now", but it means that we think that API docs and library and demos and everything is now at a point where we can stick to bug fixes, and maybe minor refactors/API changes.
[11:37:58] <arschmitz> In general in the current development environment â€¦ is that both of these are simply "not complete yet", and alpha is generally just "less complete" than beta.
[11:37:58] <arschmitz> Beta releases will still see new features, while sometimes I'll see alphas that simply try and flesh out existing stuff. And even a few things that stay in alpha or beta forever.
[11:38:12] <arschmitz> thats a quote
[11:38:18] <jasperdegroot> I think betas are feature complere
[11:38:31] <jasperdegroot> oh ok
[11:39:09] <gabrielschulhof> TBH, alpha makes more sense in closed source.
[11:39:10] <jasperdegroot> i think it will take long before people are going to report bugs
[11:39:19] <gabrielschulhof> Like, release to your peers inside the company.
[11:39:20] <jasperdegroot> because there is a lot to update
[11:39:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i think we will get reports quicker if we call it a beta
[11:39:38] <jasperdegroot> true
[11:39:39] <arschmitz> and we can always do a beta 2
[11:39:59] <jasperdegroot> I was about to say that
[11:40:08] <arschmitz> and unline 1.4 the release log and change logs will be ready
[11:40:15] <jasperdegroot> it's not so much about doing an alpha
[11:40:16] <arschmitz> and upgrade guide
[11:40:24] <jasperdegroot> more about giving people time to test
[11:40:31] <arschmitz> we just beed to be essentaiily feature complete
[11:40:34] <arschmitz> and no broken
[11:40:41] <arschmitz> right now 1.5-dev is still broken
[11:40:41] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:40:57] <arschmitz> selectmenus are still not ok
[11:41:04] <jasperdegroot> then i agree with cgack that we should do at least one beta with a working download builder
[11:41:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: there are also RC's which the idea is are suposed to be pretty much the final product
[11:41:42] <jasperdegroot> i know
[11:41:49] <jasperdegroot> but if there is a bug in a header
[11:41:54] <jasperdegroot> we have to do another rc
[11:42:07] <arschmitz> no you can fix bugs in an RC
[11:42:19] <gabrielschulhof> RC means the library code is frozen, right?
[11:42:22] <arschmitz> no
[11:42:25] <gabrielschulhof> Not the demos, nor the tests.
[11:42:32] <jasperdegroot> i thought so
[11:42:38] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, me too.
[11:42:40] <arschmitz> nothing for a user perspective can change
[11:42:48] <arschmitz> but bugs can be fixed
[11:43:00] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:43:04] <gabrielschulhof> No, wait a sec ... that's what micro versions are for.
[11:43:08] <gabrielschulhof> Like 1.5.1
[11:43:38] <gabrielschulhof> ... because fixing a bug can have unintended side effects.
[11:43:42] <cgack> if we fix a bug doesn't that change something "from a user perspective" :)
[11:43:53] <jasperdegroot> i hope it does ;)
[11:44:31] <arschmitz> so this is not actually part of semvar they only define major minor patch
[11:44:36] <arschmitz> so its all interpertation
[11:45:29] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... I just learned that myself, but that's how we used to do releases in jQM.
[11:45:34] <gabrielschulhof> RC means no code changes.
[11:45:39] <jasperdegroot> anyways, i don't think a non-working DB is a blocker for first beta
[11:45:42] <gabrielschulhof> Just demo code at most.
[11:45:47] <arschmitz> ok
[11:46:26] <jasperdegroot> yeah gabrielschulhof, the things I said were also mostly based on how we used to do things with JQM
[11:46:27] <gabrielschulhof> I was really frustrated once because of that. I wanted to slide in the popup arrow, but it had to stay a demo for 1.3, IIRC. I could only add it in 1.4.
[11:46:39] <jasperdegroot> aww
[11:47:00] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[11:47:01] <arschmitz> from python" A branch preparing for an RC release can only have bugfixes applied that have been reviewed by other core developers. "
[11:47:13] <gabrielschulhof> Well, that's not saying much.
[11:47:21] <gabrielschulhof> We review /all/ of one another's changes.
[11:47:29] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:47:34] <arschmitz> and for final they do
[11:47:35] <arschmitz> When a final release is being cut, only the release manager (RM) can make changes to the branch. After the final release is published, the full development cycle starts again for the next minor version.
[11:48:09] <gabrielschulhof> ... and, presumably the RM has the good sense not to make any changes unless it's fire and brimstone.
[11:48:22] <arschmitz> one would assume
[11:48:36] <arschmitz> but if a bug comes up it can be fixed it is not restricted
[11:48:45] <arschmitz> it just recieves super extra looking over
[11:49:10] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:49:25] <arschmitz> we dont have to do that
[11:49:29] <arschmitz> just using it as an example
[11:49:46] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec ...
[11:49:55] <gabrielschulhof> You can retreat from RC if you see fit.
[11:50:04] <arschmitz> of course
[11:50:27] <gabrielschulhof> If /that/ kind of a bug comes up ...
[11:50:55] <arschmitz> Its just about what seems approriate from a user perspective
[11:50:58] <arschmitz> there are no hard rules
[11:51:11] <gabrielschulhof> I think the key is to draw the line somewhere.
[11:51:22] <gabrielschulhof> Can't be too much of a perfectionist.
[11:51:27] <gabrielschulhof> Better to release.
[11:51:42] <arschmitz> for example UI generally only does beta and final
[11:51:43] <gabrielschulhof> After all, if it's a bad release, people can always stick to the previous release.
[11:51:45] <arschmitz> no alpha or RC
[11:52:25] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, most of the stuff I see out there still has the round, gradient-y buttons :)
[11:52:36] <arschmitz> lol
[11:53:36] <arschmitz> yeah we dont need to decide this now
[11:53:48] <arschmitz> the important thing is builder not blocker for first release
[11:54:05] <gabrielschulhof> Sounds like ...
[11:54:18] <arschmitz> ok and one more thing for today
[11:54:42] <arschmitz> For anyone who does not already know starting next week my time will be much much more limited
[11:54:54] <arschmitz> i will no longer be contracting for the jQuery Foundation
[11:55:26] <arschmitz> So reviews and things will probably start taking a bit longer so please try to be patient
[11:55:41] <jasperdegroot> sure
[11:56:09] <arschmitz> I will eventually have 20% of my time for OSS but it will be a month or 2
[11:56:11] <gabrielschulhof> NP! I'm also totally swamped until at least the end of September, so I'm not gonna be the one putting pressure on you for sure.
[11:56:52] <cgack> good luck settling into the new gig arschmitz
[11:56:57] <gabrielschulhof> +1
[11:57:05] <arschmitz> Thank you
[11:57:09] <jasperdegroot> yeah good luck
[11:57:12] <gabrielschulhof> I'll try to squeeze in some time for panel and table.
[11:57:22] <arschmitz> Its a product still in beta which is why i wont have time at first
[11:57:33] <arschmitz> they agreed to give me 20% but not until after launch
[11:57:34] <jasperdegroot> sure it's not alpha? ;)
[11:57:48] <arschmitz> well the address is beta.* lol
[11:57:53] <jasperdegroot> haha
[11:58:05] <arschmitz> so pretty sure :-p
[11:58:09] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[11:58:17] <arschmitz> oh and next week
[11:58:22] <arschmitz> i will not be around for meeting
[11:58:27] <arschmitz> i will be in costa rica
