[09:02:30] <snover> good day
[09:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone, sorry for being a few minutes late unmuting this channel.
[09:02:39] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[09:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's been a hectic day for me.
[09:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> The ES6 module conversion landed.
[09:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> I added a few members to the mailing list.
[09:04:44] <arthurvr> Yay! :-)
[09:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have CLA signatures for many of the team members.
[09:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> But many people have also been fairly quiet.
[09:05:37] <snover> yes, i am a terrible person
[09:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps we should get a somewhat more formal commitment from people to know whether they're mostly just interested in tracking progress or if they actually plan on being active team members, triaging issues, writing docs, landing patches, etc.
[09:07:16] <arschmitz> makes sense
[09:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> What's the best way to get people to acknowledge their interest?
[09:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just file an issue and ask people to comment on it with what they're interested in doing?
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> writing code, writing docs, testing, etc?
[09:08:22] <arschmitz> that or just an email
[09:08:31] <arschmitz> incase people are not watching the repo
[09:08:34] <arthurvr> A ticket seems like that’s the best way of handling that. +1
[09:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if they're not watching the repo how active do they plan on being?
[09:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> And if they're not in our email, how do they volunteer to help?
[09:09:00] <arschmitz> true
[09:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi2, snover: What are your thoughts on that?
[09:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think anyone else is actually here :-/
[09:10:32] <arschmitz> nope
[09:11:15] <snover> off the top of my head, open an issue and then email a link to everyone? i mean it depends on how/where you want that information to be collected
[09:11:54] <jrossi2> I think I missed the context, the first message I saw was "(9:06:00 AM) scott_gonzalez: Perhaps we should get a somewhat more formal commitment from people to know whether they're mostly just interested in tracking progress or if they actually plan on being active team members, triaging issues, writing docs, landing patches, etc."
[09:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi2: I was talking about adding people to the mailing list and a lack of CLA signatures from most of the "team"
[09:12:38] <jrossi2> oh gotcha
[09:12:48] <jrossi2> well i'm one of those, though it should happen any minute now
[09:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> And many people being fairly quiet so far.
[09:13:06] <jrossi2> CLAs require VP signoffs at MSFT. VPs are hard to get to answer emails. :-)
[09:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> Right now I don't actually know *how* people plan to be involved.
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> Some might just be very pro Pointer Events and just interested in following the activity and promoting the project.
[09:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> Some might be interested in doing extensive testing on devices, but not actually writing much code.
[09:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> Some might be interested in triaging tickets and reproducing bugs, but not actually fixing them.
[09:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> etc.
[09:16:43] <jrossi2> I'm interested in helping with maintaining from a triage, reproing bugs, testing on devices, promoting, etc.
[09:17:13] <jrossi2> I nterested in writing code too. Though I'm not as familiar with the Intern testing stuff, so I'll need to brush up on that first probably.
[09:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> I think snover is the only one familiar with Intern right now ;-)
[09:18:22] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i can also assist with triage, i’m watching the repository now. i’m also here as an advisor for people working on tests, any technical feedback people want a second head for, etc.
[09:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'll file an issue for this and send an email.
[09:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of Intern...
[09:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> We're still waiting on the updated PR from jperrault.
[09:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard any objections to using jquery-release this week, so I can work on that soon.
[09:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> And there hasn't been any update on the formal objection to the spec.
[09:23:05] <jrossi2> It's looking like Tuesday will be the day for that.
[09:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Though I did request the Yandex make their objection public: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2015JanMar/0012.html
[09:23:14] <jrossi2> (from what I hear)
[09:24:24] <jrossi2> Has anyone done an assessment on how feature complete the polyfill itself is?  E.g. any aspects of the spec missing that are possible to fill
[09:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't.
[09:25:02] <jrossi2> Ultimately, getting web-platform-tests running against it will answer that I suppose.
[09:25:12] <jrossi2> I can probably help there since I know a thing about the spec.
[09:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> We do want to run the W3C tests, but it requires us to make some edits and there are soooo many files.
[09:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be good to condense the W3C tests.
[09:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> I know I volunteered to do that and never got around to it.
[09:25:56] <snover> iirc most of them were “manual” tests that could be automated using functional testing, right?
[09:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they're mostly manual tests.
[09:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> They could be automated.
[09:26:44] <jrossi2> Automation is tough for touch.
[09:26:58] <jrossi2> Though for a polyfill I suppose it's easier.
[09:27:01] <snover> well, the webdriver spec is immature and implementations are immature
[09:27:22] <jrossi2> webdriver doesn't cover touch yet. we're working on APIs for that though in V2 of the spec
[09:27:24] <snover> one of the goals of using intern was to get closer-to-native events to verify the pass through from native events to pointer events was true
[09:27:34] <jrossi2> gotcha
[09:27:46] <snover> there are implementations of touch in ios-driver and selendroid using the selenium jsonwireprotocol api
[09:28:07] <snover> the actions api will be good once it is actually stable and available
[09:28:11] <jrossi2> It might also be possible for me to get them up and running internally here in our lab using touch automation.  That wouldn't be a substitute for somthing else automated in the repo itself, but might be a good additional tool.
[09:28:40] <jrossi2> (we run a lot of framework test suites against our nightly builds trying not to break things :-))
[09:28:51] <arschmitz> i have a pretty substantial devices lab for manual testing
[09:28:58] <snover> it’s frustrating that the webdriver spec didn’t do a level 1 standard that just formalised and clarified the existing jsonwireprotocol, and then did a level 2 adding the new apis
[09:29:43] <snover> it’s moved so much because of the attempts to change stuff that i feel stuck on adding any of the new APIs to leadfoot (https://github.com/theintern/leadfoot)
[09:30:57] <jrossi2> If we need additional Windows devices for testing, I could likely provide one or two.
[09:31:37] <snover> can you just create a competitor cloud grid service that is actually reliable and fast? :)
[09:31:52] <arschmitz> i have a couple windows devices a lumia 520, lumia 920, and an htc not really sure if that covers what we need or not
[09:32:07] <arschmitz> oh and a surface RT and a dell pro tablet a
[09:32:10] <jrossi2> @snover - I'll get right on that
[09:32:20] <snover> thanks. azuuuuuure
[09:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else we should discuss today?
[09:33:36] <jrossi2> Is jQuery/Dojo planning a blog post for REC?
[09:33:49] <jrossi2> Kris had mentioned he would. But I hadn't heard more.
[09:33:57] <arschmitz> we should get issacdurazzo to make a pep logo
[09:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, let's overload him with logo design work :-P
[09:34:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping him about it.
[09:34:46] <jrossi2> logos make it real :-)
[09:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> Unless anyone has other designers we should consider.
[09:35:01] <arschmitz> could just open an issue and ping him and ask him in it thats what i did for chassis
[09:35:23] <arschmitz> then its open for other people to volunteer
[09:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/161
[09:35:43] <snover> just dig out a copy of ms paint and go to town
[09:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi2: I'm sure we'll have a blog post once the objection is dealt with.
[09:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> REC is basically immediate after that, correct?
[09:37:24] <jrossi2> yeah, REC may get published tuesday
[09:37:50] <jrossi2> Most likely scenario is a "thanks for your feedback, it has been noted. here's the REC" mail from W3C.
[09:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:38:18] <jrossi2> Actually, W3C is attempting to get Yandex to withdraw their objection. So that could happen too. But I think it's unlikely.
[09:38:38] <jrossi2> W3C publishes specs on Tues/Thurs.   Good chance it's one of those next week.
[09:38:40] <arschmitz> makes sense i have not seen any other support for yandex position really
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think that's everything.
[09:41:00] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:42:19] <arthurvr> Thanks scott!
[09:42:23] <arthurvr> bye everyone!
[11:01:23] <arschmitz> agcolom: arthurvr: gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot: cgack: sfrisk: MEeting time
[11:01:30] <arthurvr> Hi arschmitz!
[11:01:34] <cgack> howdy!
[11:01:44] <agcolom> hello,
[11:01:48] <agcolom> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=801143376
[11:01:50] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:02:48] <arschmitz> agcolom: thank you
[11:03:08] <agcolom> you're welcome. I've updated issues and PR counts
[11:05:38] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[11:05:57] <arschmitz> nothing big on animation stuff in core a few more comments this week
[11:06:31] <arschmitz> style guides
[11:06:41] <arschmitz> for any of you that do not follow the contribute repo
[11:06:48] <arschmitz> the style guides change pretty often
[11:06:57] <arschmitz> there have been some big changes recently
[11:07:48] <arschmitz> mainly around spacing
[11:08:09] <arschmitz> you will see we have removed the rules about spaces inside brackets
[11:09:15] <arschmitz> and also dropping one var is likely https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/105
[11:10:58] <arschmitz> those are some pretty big changes
[11:11:28] <arthurvr> yup - for those that aren’t following that repo, it’s worth checking it out
[11:11:53] <agcolom> arschmitz: the examples still seem to use spacing inside the brackets
[11:12:13] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats the change
[11:12:21] <arschmitz> there used to be execptions
[11:12:28] <agcolom> oh, ok
[11:12:39] <agcolom> sorry ;-) so always use spaces
[11:12:50] <cgack> so do we need to retrofit the code all at once, or as we edit a file, then change it
[11:12:50] <arschmitz> yup
[11:13:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey! Sorry I'm late!
[11:13:05] <agcolom> perfect. I'm happy with that!
[11:13:12] <agcolom> hey gabriel_schulhof :-)
[11:13:15] <arschmitz> cgack: thats would be way to much work jzaefferer is working on an esformater update to do it
[11:13:44] <jasperdegroot> I think we don't want tons of whitespace commits on master
[11:14:41] <cgack> arschmitz: right on
[11:14:49] <arschmitz> overall this really simplifies our rules
[11:15:33] <agcolom> Added to notes:
[11:15:34] <agcolom> changes regularly. Recent change: Removed exceptions to the use of spaces inside brackets. Watchout also for possible upcoming change regarding onevar
[11:15:47] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so this._on( { click: "_handleClick" } );
[11:15:48] <gabriel_schulhof> ?
[11:15:52] <arschmitz> agcolom: sounds good
[11:16:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes but thats not a change
[11:16:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes it is. We've always had ({ abc: def }) if the hash is the only param.
[11:17:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Like the ubiquitous }); will now be } );
[11:17:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/0d02b388d520924aaed2
[11:17:43] <arschmitz> just proves my point old rules were too complicated
[11:17:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Whew! So even one key: value pair needs to be indented on three lines?
[11:18:04] <arschmitz> does not need to be no
[11:18:22] <arschmitz> the point was that even on the top and bottom there are now spaces
[11:18:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. OK.
[11:18:33] <cgack> \o/ for simpler rules - new contributors will like it
[11:18:45] <arschmitz> there are no execptions on spacing now
[11:18:46] <jasperdegroot> old contributers too :)
[11:18:56] <arschmitz> there is always a space
[11:18:58] <cgack> jasperdegroot: indeed!
[11:19:06] <arthurvr> For sure :-) The less exceptions the better!
[11:19:52] <arschmitz> there weird execptions were also the last thing blocking full support in jscs for jquery style guide
[11:20:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Will .jshintrc reflect this, or is this up to jscs or is this up to you, arschmitz ... because I just know it's gonna take me some time to adjust.
[11:20:07] <gabriel_schulhof> ?
[11:20:20] <arschmitz> it would be jscs
[11:20:25] <gabriel_schulhof> ... eventually.
[11:20:32] <arschmitz> and jzaefferer is working on esformatter update
[11:20:36] <arschmitz> we wont do this by hand
[11:20:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Boy, when that thing goes live, our build will collapse into a singularity.
[11:21:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Whoever commits the resulting whitespace fix will forever hold the record for lines changed in a single commit :)
[11:21:36] <arschmitz> ok moving on
[11:21:42] <arschmitz> ui-1-12
[11:21:45] <arschmitz> has passing test
[11:21:51] <gabriel_schulhof> ... except one.
[11:21:52] <arschmitz> and has all the ui updates
[11:21:55] <arschmitz> ?
[11:22:00] <gabriel_schulhof> <abbr> in columntoggle.
[11:22:09] <arschmitz> it passed when i ran them locally
[11:22:09] <gabriel_schulhof> The new <span> </span> is throwin it off.
[11:22:28] <gabriel_schulhof> I just ran it.
[11:22:32] <gabriel_schulhof> It's legit.
[11:22:36] <arschmitz> huh ok
[11:22:59] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it's hard to retrieve text() when you have a mixture of text nodes and spans.
[11:23:01] <arschmitz> maybe i ran them before the updateDependencies
[11:23:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: check out how i do it in ui
[11:23:12] <gabriel_schulhof> You can't .contents().not( "span" )
[11:23:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because that drops the text node.
[11:23:36] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:24:02] <gabriel_schulhof> I was just planning on sifting through .contents() with .each()
[11:24:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there are better ways
[11:24:24] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll see how you did it.
[11:24:26] <arschmitz> i do that in one place and im removing it
[11:24:44] <gabriel_schulhof> ... could use a link though, to speed things up.
[11:24:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: give me a link to the context
[11:25:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Jussec ...
[11:25:07] <arschmitz> and ill link you to the right way i do it several ways depnding on context
[11:25:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: let do that in dev though
[11:25:47] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/ui-1-12/tests/unit/table/table_core.js#L178
[11:25:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, OK.
[11:25:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Sorry!
[11:26:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: lol add a space before Rotten
[11:26:25] <arschmitz> dont over complicate it
[11:26:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, alright ...
[11:26:39] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess I'm a purist.
[11:26:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: in the widgets them selves i do extra stuff to be sure
[11:27:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Can I push that to ui-1-12?
[11:27:13] <arschmitz> but in a test the truth is there SHOULD be a spce there if there was not the icon would be missaligned
[11:27:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats fine
[11:27:22] <gabriel_schulhof> To et that verdant feeling?
[11:27:54] <arschmitz> huh?
[11:28:36] <gabriel_schulhof> You know, spring, leaves budding, nature going from bleak to ... green.
[11:28:45] <arschmitz> gotcha
[11:29:20] <arschmitz> ok so as just mentioned by gabriel_schulhof the update for button using inline icons and the "space" span
[11:29:23] <arschmitz> has landed in mobile
[11:29:46] <arschmitz> so this is a pretty big change to our icons
[11:30:51] <arschmitz> ok pointer events
[11:31:04] <arschmitz> i think i mentioned last week about the formal objection
[11:31:10] <arschmitz> to the recomendation
[11:31:54] <arschmitz> From what was said in the pep meeting today it looks like one way or another the recommendation is likely to be published next week
[11:31:57] <arschmitz> likely tuesday
[11:32:24] <arschmitz> Sorry i think i gave wrong impression there
[11:32:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Ok, so "OVERRULED!" ... ?
[11:32:44] <arschmitz> the one way or the other is that the W3C is trying to get Yandex to withdraw their objection
[11:32:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Aha. OK.
[11:32:59] <arschmitz> and either way will like publish next week
[11:33:18] <arschmitz> either with it withdrawn or saying well duely noted but we are publishing anyway
[11:33:36] <cgack> awesome
[11:33:39] <arschmitz> so this is good news
[11:34:26] <agcolom> is it ok to add latest change: button using inline icons and the "space" span to notes on 1.5.0?
[11:34:36] <arschmitz> sure
[11:34:55] <arschmitz> calsses and button and autoinit and accordion ... are all sub topics of 1.5
[11:35:36] <agcolom> yes, I moved to to button
[11:35:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Can we delete ui-1-12-test-fixes?
[11:35:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[11:36:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and ui-1-12-tests
[11:36:11] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:36:22] <arschmitz> yes
[11:36:50] <cgack> all classes PRs should be against ui-1-12 right?
[11:37:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep. The game is on!
[11:37:48] <arschmitz> yep
[11:38:05] * gabriel_schulhof hums "Eye Of The Tiger"
[11:38:56] <arschmitz> Ok now that i completely re arranged the agenda lol...
[11:39:14] <arschmitz> RTL
[11:39:20] <arschmitz> we had the call last friday
[11:39:34] <arschmitz> It looks like there is a LOT more work here then we though
[11:39:57] <arschmitz> depending on the level of support we want to provide anyway
[11:40:54] <arschmitz> we talked to the people that worked on the implementation for Dojo and IBM
[11:41:09] <arschmitz> and they got us in contact with some more experts
[11:41:18] <arschmitz> who gave us info on more better experts lol
[11:41:30] <gabriel_schulhof> mo' betta
[11:41:37] <arschmitz> exactly
[11:41:45] <arschmitz> so now we have ALL THE EXPERTS
[11:41:54] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:41:56] <arschmitz> and a slightly daunting task lol
[11:42:10] <arschmitz> but its a lot of css so depending on timing could get pushed to chassis
[11:42:35] <arschmitz> but there will still be a substantial JS component likely tied into the widget factory in some way
[11:42:40] <arschmitz> maybe
[11:42:45] <gabriel_schulhof> What about taking the reactive approach and doing it on a per-issue-filed basis?
[11:43:09] <arschmitz> because of the nature of needing a whole system in place
[11:43:19] <arschmitz> we need to basicly have all the bits in place no matter what
[11:43:32] <arschmitz> like we could not actually implement all of per component dir
[11:43:40] <arschmitz> but we basicly need to do 90% either way
[11:44:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ...
[11:44:20] <arschmitz> but we dont need to get into that here
[11:44:26] <arschmitz> we have a group working on that
[11:44:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: which your part of
[11:45:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep. Gonna be fun :)
[11:45:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it looks like you have 2 things animation complete and perf bug
[11:45:34] <arschmitz> any updates on those
[11:45:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Nope. I guess we can remove the perf bug, because it's just another PR awaiting review.
[11:46:15] <gabriel_schulhof> The animationComplete, I suppose I can file an issue, if I haven't already, but it's low prio for now.
[11:46:23] <arschmitz> ok
[11:46:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I filed it already. I think those two items can go.
[11:47:37] <arschmitz> ok i think that should about wrap it up then
[11:47:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Just one question: What's up with famo.us?
[11:47:56] <arschmitz> ill be doing a lot of pr reviews and updates in the next week since classes i think has setteled down
[11:47:57] <gabriel_schulhof> What are we doing together?
[11:48:04] <arschmitz> i have no answers
[11:48:15] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Just curious.
[11:48:38] <arschmitz> sorry
[11:48:44] <gabriel_schulhof> NP!
[11:48:58] <arschmitz> i mean in the video they made they mention it some
[11:49:12] <arschmitz> they are making some really nice looking animated widgets
[11:49:27] <arschmitz> thats what famo.us is doing any way
[11:49:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. I guess we'll get the picture sooner or later.
[11:50:17] <gabriel_schulhof> It's funny that we're dealing with two different animation-related projects simultaneously, namely famo.us, and velocity.
[11:50:57] <gabriel_schulhof> But we'll see, I guess, how it turns out. I'm sure we'll have some gains.
[11:51:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway ...
[11:51:02] <cgack> i understood it as famo.us is saying - jQuery rocks, and we want to be a part of it (more or less). and jQuery saying "we totally think so too, welcome aboard"
[11:51:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that's about it though.
[11:51:32] <arschmitz> cgack: that too
[11:53:00] <arschmitz> ok well ill see everyone back in -dev
[11:53:06] <gabriel_schulhof> L8R
