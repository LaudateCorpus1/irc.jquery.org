[03:09:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik, Minkyeong, arschmitz: Hey, all!
[03:09:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Wanna do a short meeting?
[03:10:10] <arschmitz> hi
[03:10:17] <gabriel_schulhof> K ... weird ... the server re-muted the room after I had un-muted it.
[03:10:20] <Kangsik> arschmitz: hi :-)
[03:10:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Sorry about that!
[03:10:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah i saw that odd
[03:10:32] <Minkyeong> hi, all :-)
[03:10:34] <arschmitz> Kangsik: hi
[03:10:34] <Kangsik> I send PRs at today moring(in korea time). https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7565   and      https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/323
[03:10:42] <Kangsik> Please review PRs and then tell me your opinions. I'm sorry for the delay of PRs.
[03:10:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome!
[03:10:51] <arschmitz> Kangsik: awesome
[03:11:19] <arschmitz> im probably doing mostly pr reviews today trying to catch up from vacation so hopefully ill get to those today
[03:11:50] <Kangsik> arschmitz: Yes. :-)
[03:14:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: library PR's looking pretty good.
[03:14:34] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Thank you. :)
[03:14:40] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess there are no examples without corners in the existing demos, so no need to touch the existing demos.
[03:15:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Just need the comments in the code about option mini and option corners being deprecated.
[03:16:38] <arschmitz> yeah button does most of the work for this since its jut corners and mini
[03:16:50] <arschmitz> makes this one much simpler
[03:17:19] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof,arschmitz: Yes. I will remove demo in PR.
[03:17:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Wait. The demo you added is OK.
[03:17:43] <arschmitz> yeah demo is fine
[03:18:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: I'm saying add things like // Deprecated as of 1.5.0 above the declaration of option corners and option mini in js/widgets/forms/textinput.js
[03:19:01] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Ahh.. Yes. thank you for your kindness.
[03:19:25] <arschmitz> Kangsik: we just like to keep comments like that to make it easy to remove deprecated code between versions
[03:19:40] <arschmitz> can just search for "deprecated"
[03:20:54] <Kangsik> arschmitz: Yes.
[03:22:37] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. That's good progress. Do we have any other topics?
[03:22:47] <arschmitz> just browsing real quick i dont see anything gabriel_schulhof has not mentioned already with textinput thought ill look more closely when iv been awake for more then a few minutes :)
[03:23:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: :)
[03:23:05] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof : No. I told all things.
[03:23:13] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, then I have two things.
[03:23:18] <gabriel_schulhof> http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw-api-docs/local.xyzzy/
[03:23:37] <gabriel_schulhof> I've decided to update web-ui-fw for jQuery Mobile 1.4.3, and then maybe mention it on jquerymobile.com.
[03:24:04] <gabriel_schulhof> I've separated our API docs from the jQuery theme, so we don't use the jquery-wp-content anymore.
[03:24:05] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Awesome!
[03:25:06] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/widgets/tokentextarea/tokentextarea.html
[03:25:14] <arschmitz> cool
[03:25:33] <gabriel_schulhof> I've been working on tokentextarea to make it use fewer new classes and use more jQuery Mobile classes for the styling.
[03:25:48] <gabriel_schulhof> I also wanna break up the widget into a base class and at least one extension.
[03:26:08] <gabriel_schulhof> The base class would handle the tokenization, and the extension would add the link to the contact list.
[03:26:57] <gabriel_schulhof> I was thinking about making it a new widget (calling it tokentextarea2 right now) in addition to tokentextarea, and deprecating one or the other depending on which one people like - if they even notice web-ui-fw :)
[03:27:01] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: I agree your words.
[03:27:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Awesome!
[03:27:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: I'll keep hacking at it and publish something eventually. Let's hope we can get people using it.
[03:27:51] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and arschmitz has been working on a cross-project download builder, so we should be able to integrate with that too, eventually.
[03:28:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway - just thought I'd throw it out there ...
[03:28:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes hopefully now that 1.4.3 is out and things are setteled down i can push to get that finished
[03:28:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Definitely looking forward to it.
[03:29:19] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. That's it on my part.
[03:30:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wanna say a few words about our immediate plans for the next couple of weeks? That is, if you're awake enough for it :)
[03:30:08] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: what do i do to help you?
[03:30:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Hmmm ... good question.
[03:31:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i think the next few week we will be havily focusing on 1.5 in an effort to make some more tangible progress thetre
[03:31:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: I dunno ... maybe have another look at VirtualGrid?
[03:31:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: 1.4.3 was a success it seems so we wont need to push for a 1.4.4 too soon
[03:32:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, really? Cool!
[03:32:09] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: what is mean?
[03:32:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm frustrated a bit because I introduced some regressions :(
[03:32:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ping me on them in #jqueryui-dev if you can i have not caught up on all my emails yet
[03:33:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. Will do.
[03:33:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Thanks!
[03:33:26] <arschmitz> i guess how serious they are will determin how soon
[03:33:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: For example, can you think of a way of breaking it down into multiple extensions?
[03:33:57] <arschmitz> but i really want to shift focus away from patch releases to 1.5 development
[03:34:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Is it possible to create a small widget that doesn't have the complete VirtualGrid API, but that provides some usefulness in itself?
[03:34:20] <arschmitz> for the main team
[03:34:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Agreed.
[03:35:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: In fact, us web-ui-fw-ers have been doing nothing but 1.5 all this time :)
[03:35:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup but the main team has been much more focused on patch releases up until now
[03:35:46] <arschmitz> id like to see some 1.5 stuff actually start landing :)
[03:35:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I must admit - me too, as soon as I saw those reports. I was, nevertheless, pleasantly surprised by how few issues we received afterwards.
[03:36:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Agreed.
[03:36:15] <arschmitz> i think my super obsessive testing helped this time
[03:36:25] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Hmm. Ok I should think about the improvements about the virtualgrid.
[03:36:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Yeah, but don't worry about it too much. If you have the time, just look at the code, and see if you can find places where it can be cleaned up a bit.
[03:37:30] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: yes
[03:37:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: I can tell you from personal experience that, going back to my own code after having worked with jQM so much helps me find a lot of things I can improve.
[03:37:49] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: I mistake something. I think that you should listen hyunsook opinion before modifying token textarea.
[03:38:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: That's a good idea. That's why I haven't modified it. I started a second widget which does the same thing, and I've tried to use the same API as tokentextarea, but it would be good to merge the two widgets eventually.
[03:38:47] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Hyunsook has ownership about tokentextarea.
[03:38:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: OK.
[03:39:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Actually, if we can fix up the tokentextarea styling to work with jQM 1.4.3, I think the widget will definitely be good to go.
[03:40:14] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Yes. I think so. :-)
[03:40:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Well, I'll wait for Hyunsook before I do anything major. Let's give her time.
[03:40:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: I can also start cleaning up my own widgets, like hsvpicker and colorpalette.
[03:41:23] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and there's also gonna be /a lot/ of jQM 1.5 work.
[03:41:37] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I guess, no shortage of work all 'round :)
[03:42:00] <gabriel_schulhof> We could use a small country of developers for this project :)
[03:42:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: iv been recruiting quite a bit lately
[03:42:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we have some new people like cgack getting pretty good and joebot0101 whos trying to find his nich to help out more
[03:43:04] <arschmitz> so there is SOME hope there
[03:43:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Excellent!
[03:44:13] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. So, if we're good for the next week, let's call it a meeting.
[03:44:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Have a good week all, followed by a relaxing weekend, and let's do this again next week!
[03:45:44] <Kangsik> Have such a nice week and weekend~~ :)
