[09:00:16] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:39] <kborchers> full house today :P
[09:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:01:56] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> Since the plugin site issue has spiraled out of control, I'm going to take a break from it and focus on the UI tasks that I've had on hold for weeks.
[09:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> So I should have reviews for selectmenu and AMD either this week or next.
[09:03:52] <tj_vantoll> Sweet.
[09:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think too much else has happend this past week.
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have any updates to report?
[09:05:40] <kborchers> i'm just looking at menu bugs and may look at others if there is anything that needs specific attention
[09:05:47] <tj_vantoll> datepicker branch now has a wiped history.
[09:05:51] <kborchers> needed a break from PointerEvents and old IE
[09:06:17] <tj_vantoll> datepicker-dead has the history for reference.
[09:06:43] <tj_vantoll> Got the default demo working, need to move forward to the others. Small progress, but progress.
[09:09:57] <tj_vantoll> I also built this: http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/Phd7H/show/. Thought you guys would be interested and wondered if you had any feedback.
[09:10:32] <rxaviers> Hi, sorry for the delay
[09:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: That's a nice comparison page.
[09:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> Some things are nicer in jQuery UI and some are nicer in Kendo UI.
[09:14:08] <tj_vantoll> Yeah agreed.
[09:14:51] <rxaviers> Cool Scott, looking fwd for the AMD reviews :)... I have no updates about UI. I've been working on Globalize (porting date format function)... I am using dojo as a starting point. The new cldr date format function is actually getting more similar to dojo than to previous globalize code :8
[09:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You're only looking at public APIs, not implementation, right?
[09:15:47] <rxaviers> very cool th
[09:15:48] <rxaviers> tj*
[09:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> When comparing to dojo.
[09:16:17] <rxaviers> I looked at their code/implementation.
[09:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:16:59] <rxaviers> Keeping Globalize API (as much as possible)
[09:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> You have to be very careful when looking at code that is copyright someone else.
[09:19:49] <rxaviers> To be more precise, Im working on this fn https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/lib/globalize.js#L448 , I used CLDR doc as reference http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table , and this dojo implementation as ref too https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/date/locale.js#L32
[09:20:11] <rxaviers> Yeah, I understand. That's my concern.
[09:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:27:55] <ipc9> i noticed that there is a ticket out to enforce the style guide via the build process.  is that something that is still relevant?
[09:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, jzaefferer is working on it.
[09:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter/pull/46
[09:28:51] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #46 by jzaefferer (2mon 1w ago): WIP: jQuery preset
[09:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's continue any other discussion in -dev.
[09:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
