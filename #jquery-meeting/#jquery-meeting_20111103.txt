[11:17:20] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2902
[11:17:21] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2902 on jquery-mobile, reported by cfjedimaster (2d, 1h ago): Provide a downloadable version of the jQuery Mobile docs
[11:18:46] <Wilto> Currently there are some back-end dependencies involved with the docs—to make these downloadable, we’ll have to do a little reworking of build scripts.
[11:18:56] <danheberden> toddparker would having the site on github be a good solution to that?
[11:19:04] <danheberden> so it could be pulled and ran locally?
[11:20:25] <Wilto> Eh, they can run them locally pulling from the repo now—we’re just looking into a way to make them… Non-webserver-y.
[11:20:44] <danheberden> i was thinking just the site - i.e. separate them
[11:20:56] <danheberden> that would also give us the ability to package it for download
[11:22:12] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2881
[11:22:13] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2881 on jquery-mobile, reported by agcolom (5d, 21h ago): Inconsistent background on themeless dialogs
[11:22:21] <eddiemonge> im going to make a slight change to the makefile so the zip will get created as well
[11:22:30] <Wilto> s/background/box-shadow
[11:22:46] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2871
[11:22:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2871 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (6d, 18h ago): Expose an overlay theme option for dialogs and selects
[11:23:02] <Wilto> I think I actually have #2881 patched locally—just have to re-check and commit it.
[11:23:59] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2858
[11:23:59] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2858 on jquery-mobile, reported by siromega (1w, 18h ago): Button text hit test issue
[11:26:45] <eddiemonge> i like how teamchat worked perfectly years ago for multiple users with great sound quality and no issues at all
[11:31:40] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2853
[11:31:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2853 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (1w, 1d ago): Improve page enhancement performance
[11:31:51] <Wilto> This is, no doubt, the big one.
[11:32:04] <Wilto> kinblas has been working on this for the past week or so.
[11:33:07] <Wilto> We’re using exaggerated pages—lists of four hundred buttons, that sort of thing—as our performance test cases.
[11:35:02] <Wilto> The glaring factor is back-and-forth with the DOM, naturally.
[11:36:31] <Wilto> With some minor tweaks to the button markup code, kinblas has already made some massive improvements to performance.
[11:37:40] <Wilto> In parallel, we’re putting together some frameworks for performance testing.
[11:38:47] <Wilto> I am hoping for some cool charts, as I am easily excited by things as simple as shapes and bright colors.
[11:40:01] <Wilto> kinblas: also discovered that placing a listener at the document level—even if it’s just one, with no logic attached—messes with the smoothness of scrolling in iOS5.
[11:40:14] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2716
[11:40:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2716 on jquery-mobile, reported by MauriceG (2w, 4d ago): iOS5 and touchOverflow
[11:40:17] <Wilto> This is, by and large, Sort of a Big Deal™.
[11:43:13] <Wilto> This is a feature we’ll need to keep working on and refining, due to some “unique” quirks in the implementation of -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
[11:43:27] <Wilto> Not ready to become default behavior just yet.
[11:46:46] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2588
[11:46:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2588 on jquery-mobile, reported by awoni (1m, 3d ago): Windows Phone 7.5 native select menu problem
[11:47:39] <Wilto> This bug is the bane of my existence.
[11:48:08] <Wilto> The details would surely drive you all mad. I will shoulder this burden for you.
[11:55:56] <Wilto> BREAKING: Skype is terrible.
[11:59:58] <Wilto> We’re still looking at two weeks or so for 1.0, barring any incident.
[12:03:47] <sergeyg> hi
[12:03:53] <toddparker> sergeyg > kinblas
[12:04:47] <Wilto> BREAKING: Skype is like having an entire meeting filtered through the weird echo-y vocal effect in the Phil Collins song “In The Air Tonight.”
[12:06:43] <toddparker> alright all, thanks!
[12:06:49] <toddparker> meeting adjourned
[12:07:49] <Wilto> We need to get toddparker a gavel.
[12:08:18] <kinblas> sergeyg: the dev channel is #jquerymobile-dev
[12:08:26] <kinblas> we're on that all day
