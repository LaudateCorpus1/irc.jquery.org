[09:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:02:53] <kborchers> o/
[09:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Infrastructure?
[09:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> Any news on staging for api.jqueryui.com?
[09:04:22] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez still working on staging for plugins?
[09:04:24] <rworth> hey
[09:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> Is either one blocking the other or are they just being blocked by dependent puppet configs?
[09:06:37] <danheberden> more or less blocking that i can only work on one thing at a time
[09:06:46] <danheberden> so i've been working on getting puppet to install node
[09:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you get a chance to look into unit test failures?
[09:10:01] <danheberden> (speaking of node: https://github.com/danheberden/puppet-nodejs)
[09:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> guess not, moving on...
[09:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I have made some more progress on the grunt build.
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> ADM still isn't working, so we're still shelling out for zip.
[09:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> We upgraded to grunt 0.3.0, and will be upgrading again once some more fixes land in grunt.
[09:13:09] <jzaefferer> yeah, need to try that for unzipping, see if at least that part works, then report bugs
[09:13:20] <jzaefferer> actually at 0.3.5 now
[09:13:45] <jzaefferer> extracted the cssmin and csslint tasks into a standalone grunt plugin
[09:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-css
[09:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> We've also verified that the CDN output is correct.
[09:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to verify that the full output is correct (likely true since CDN is working), then we'll land in master and 1-8-stable.
[09:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Anything else related to grunt?
[09:15:21] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Any update on docs?
[09:15:52] <rworth> no
[09:16:00] <jzaefferer> Well, the sizer task needs to get extracted and we need to go through the js and css lint warnings and figure out what to fix
[09:16:25] <jzaefferer> But that can happen after we close the grunt branch - its new, didn't exist before
[09:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I figure we'll go through lint output once we land in master.
[09:17:14] <jzaefferer> Once grunt plugins are settled, I can work with Rick on the sizer
[09:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> That currently works for us, right?
[09:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> You just need to work on a common API so it can be moved to a plugin?
[09:18:30] <jzaefferer> The way we include plugins should change tonight (said Ben), afterwards we can just extract the task
[09:18:43] <jzaefferer> Then coordinate with Rick to make sure it works for core as well
[09:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> moving on to accordion
[09:19:27] <jzaefferer> DONE
[09:19:32] <rworth> wohoo
[09:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:19:44] <jzaefferer> kborchers: cheering, now
[09:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> Hans sent a PR with ARIA updates.
[09:20:06] <kborchers> \o/
[09:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> I landed that, fixed the ARIA tests, added tests for keybaord support, and documented the keyboard support on the wiki.
[09:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> Also noted differences between our implementation and the ARIA best practices on the wiki.
[09:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> I also added tests for animation.
[09:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> So accordion has no open tasks :-)
[09:21:06] <jzaefferer> tests for animation? Didn't see those yet
[09:21:21] * kborchers goes to file accordion bugs :P
[09:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/4a6692a57aa156dcaa916af66b36f767a25e37c3
[09:21:29] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (18h, 15m ago): Accordion: Added animation tests.
[09:22:15] <kborchers> New Bug: Accordion doesn't work inside Button ... jQuery UI broke my site!!!
[09:22:22] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:22:36] <jzaefferer> .promise() gives you a promise for the animation queue?
[09:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/aneyuh/edit#javascript,html
[09:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yup :-)
[09:24:23] <jzaefferer> Anyway, let's get m7 out
[09:24:27] <jzaefferer> land grunt, then m7?
[09:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure it matters.
[09:24:47] <kborchers> LOL!!!
[09:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably release m7 now with ant.
[09:25:10] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:25:19] <jzaefferer> Did you test collapsible accordions?
[09:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ant works, and we only do partial builds for milestones anyway.
[09:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[09:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the focus bug?
[09:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> Hans said he fixed it in his PR.
[09:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> When he removed the forced focus/blur.
[09:26:45] <jzaefferer> uhm
[09:26:45] <jzaefferer> http://jsbin.com/akoyoy
[09:27:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's a FEATURE
[09:27:29] <jzaefferer> but yeah, focus isn't lost anymore
[09:27:31] <kborchers> that is awesome!
[09:27:31] <jzaefferer> so that's cool
[09:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You know that's inside a button, right?
[09:27:46] <jzaefferer> oh
[09:27:52] <jzaefferer> haha
[09:27:56] <kborchers> ?me modifies accordion docs "Works inside Button!"
[09:27:56] * bot-t modifies accordion docs "Works inside Button!"
[09:28:15] <kborchers> thanks for fixing that bot-t
[09:28:15] <bot-t> ;)
[09:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:28:37] * jzaefferer slaps kborchers
[09:28:48] <kborchers> sorry too much coffee today
[09:28:53] <jzaefferer> DON'T YOU KNOW HOW IRC WORKS?
[09:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we'll release 1.9m7 and then review grunt so we can release 1.8.19.
[09:29:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you verify grunt, I'll prepare m7?
[09:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:29:46] <jzaefferer> Adjourned!
[09:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> Just compare the directory structure to m6.
[09:29:50] * jzaefferer HAMMERTIME
[09:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think we strip out docs and leave everything else.
[09:30:04] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:30:27] <kborchers> jzaefferer: http://wil.to/_/hammertime.jpg
[09:31:10] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I see what you did there
[09:31:26] <jzaefferer> maybe one day you can come up with your own memes :p
[09:31:49] <kborchers> nah, no need when you have Wilto :)
[09:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna mute before it gets nasty in here :-P
[09:31:58] <kborchers> heh
[09:32:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you can take away kborchers voice, but you will never take our FREEDOM
[09:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHA
[09:34:22] * scott_gonzalez steals jzaefferer's freedom
