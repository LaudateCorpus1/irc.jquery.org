[09:01:52] <mikesherov> I forgot there was a meeting today
[09:02:07] <rwaldron> ajpiano and I are in Bocoupfest
[09:02:18] <rwaldron> so we can't attend today <3
[09:02:45] <mikesherov> I'm MLKing it up
[09:03:02] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah it's a holiday for some folks
[09:03:10] <DaveMethvin> i'm doing training today so i forgot
[09:03:12] <DaveMethvin> actually in NYC
[09:03:41] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: You in NYC tomorrow too?
[09:03:49] <mikesherov> We should meet up
[09:03:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, tomorrow night
[09:03:58] <gibson042> hey all
[09:04:03] <DaveMethvin> the training ends at 5pm
[09:04:06] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:04:13] <orkel> hi
[09:04:18] <DaveMethvin> i put together an agenda but i think we are in pretty good shape
[09:04:23] <DaveMethvin> i landed a bunch of stuff
[09:04:33] <DaveMethvin> the 2.0 build problem is the grunt issue i think
[09:04:51] <DaveMethvin> now it's at rc6 and probably broke more stuff :D
[09:05:14] <DaveMethvin> if you look at the package.json for 1.9 it references specific commit hashes
[09:05:21] <DaveMethvin> b/c the version numbrers are useless at this point
[09:05:40] <mikesherov> Yeah, we should get 1.9.1 out soon. Maybe another week in case any more egregious regressions?
[09:05:40] <DaveMethvin> multiple incompatible versions of the grunt plugins have the same version number
[09:05:49] <gibson042> ick
[09:05:53] <DaveMethvin> i think next week would be good
[09:06:01] <gibson042> agreed on that
[09:06:15] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to land 1.9.1 fixes asap so we  have it stable and can test for a few days
[09:06:30] <mikesherov> Yeah, we should never use version ranges again unless we're Adding support for older versions
[09:06:43] <DaveMethvin> i really think even ~ is a bad idea :)
[09:07:08] <mikesherov> ~ is a range
[09:07:24] <DaveMethvin> right, so the range goes from it works to it's broken now :)
[09:07:29] <mikesherov> I specifically meant ~ or >= or whatever
[09:07:44] <mikesherov> All bad ideas
[09:07:46] <gibson042> yeah, ~ only makes sense with strict adherence to semver, which we just don't have
[09:08:11] <mikesherov> So... yeah.
[09:08:11] <DaveMethvin> and really *that* semver problem wasn't a jquery one
[09:08:20] <gibson042> yep
[09:08:32] <DaveMethvin> we have our own private  hell
[09:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You should be able to use rc6, but the APIs changed since rc4.
[09:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> The APIs are supposedly stable now.
[09:09:20] <mikesherov> :/
[09:09:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah ben mentioned that, we could try to move forward to rc6
[09:09:35] <DaveMethvin> i might be able to get to that tonight
[09:10:17] <mikesherov> Ok gents I gotta run
[09:10:25] <mikesherov> Currently being rude to my guests
[09:10:33] <DaveMethvin> np thanks mikesherov
[09:10:37] <gibson042> take care mikesherov
[09:11:07] <DaveMethvin> on the open tix there were one or two i wondered about ... let me look
[09:11:09] <mikesherov> I think I addressed the big breaks I caused. I'm clear for 1.9.1
[09:12:34] <DaveMethvin> several ajaxy ones I'd like to get jaubourg's input on, i guess i'll just cc him on the ticket
[09:12:49] <gibson042> still waiting on Trac...
[09:13:06] <DaveMethvin> like 204 no content being parsed ... um, why are they sending content if it's 204 no content???
[09:13:19] <DaveMethvin> but then again we probalby should ignore it
[09:13:28] <gibson042> oh yeah, that one
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> no content ... execpt this content
[09:13:58] <DaveMethvin> but if they explicitly said it was json for example
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> then what should we return?
[09:14:07] <DaveMethvin> that's an error?
[09:14:22] <DaveMethvin> stupid edge cases
[09:14:28] <gibson042> honestly, I think we're doing it correct now
[09:14:47] <gibson042> treating the responses as non-normative metadata in most cases
[09:15:00] <DaveMethvin> oh and this one http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13282
[09:15:03] <gibson042> *response codes
[09:15:22] <DaveMethvin> depending on which browsers we want 2.0 to support we may need to give up on .apply(x, nodelist)
[09:15:25] <gibson042> yeah, that's the one we worked around in jquery-migrate unit tests
[09:15:41] <gibson042> phantomjs is qtwebkit, right?
[09:15:47] <DaveMethvin> seems like it
[09:15:53] <DaveMethvin> it sucks in the same way
[09:15:55] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:15:58] <timmywil> ah
[09:16:17] <DaveMethvin> we could check for it in a feature test and use it when it doesn't blow up
[09:16:28] <gibson042> it wouldn't be worth it
[09:16:35] <DaveMethvin> takes another function call but saves an explicit loop in js?
[09:16:54] <DaveMethvin> that is, where it's supported
[09:17:16] <gibson042> meh
[09:17:28] <DaveMethvin> really annoying that we can't use it
[09:17:35] <timmywil> someone just pm'd me and asked if I know jquery
[09:17:35] <gibson042> I'd like to either say "not supported in 2.0" or abandon the optimization
[09:17:39] <DaveMethvin> but i think we're gonna have to back it out
[09:17:41] <timmywil> I'm not sure how to respond
[09:17:45] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: tell em no
[09:18:29] <timmywil> anyone else getting issues with grunt watch btw?
[09:18:35] <DaveMethvin> i don't use it
[09:18:40] <timmywil> I keep getting "too many open files"
[09:18:49] <DaveMethvin> but it is probably the updates not being compatible
[09:19:26] <timmywil> yea
[09:19:26] <gibson042> IIRC there wasn't much perf advantage to `core_push.apply` vs. `jQuery.merge`; just file size
[09:19:26] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: can you back that one out then
[09:19:35] <orkel> for my tests jQuery.merge sometimes faster then core_push.apply
[09:19:51] <gibson042> yeah, I'll cc rwaldron
[09:20:26] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I would love 1.9.1 this week
[09:21:10] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: do you have time to look at the build issues? We should be getting a clean test run before 1.9.1
[09:21:22] <DaveMethvin> our grunt setup is in shambles atm
[09:21:50] <DaveMethvin> i *think* it's just a case of updating to grunt rc5 and the compatible plugins
[09:21:59] <DaveMethvin> but famous last words and such
[09:22:07] <timmywil> I could look into it, but I bet rwaldron could fix it faster
[09:22:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah where is that newlywed guy?
[09:22:36] <DaveMethvin> oh he's at bocoupfest
[09:22:49] <timmywil> oh did I mention? I'm getting married too! :)
[09:22:54] <DaveMethvin> really?
[09:22:58] <timmywil> yes
[09:23:05] <DaveMethvin> but you just got a bike!
[09:23:05] <gibson042> congrats!
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> you can't do both!
[09:23:23] <timmywil>  she can ride with me
[09:23:25] <gibson042> btw timmywill did you see ?13281
[09:23:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah congrats
[09:23:33] <DaveMethvin> that's the spirit
[09:23:34] <gibson042> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13281 ?
[09:23:54] <DaveMethvin> There was a dup on that one too i think
[09:24:31] <gibson042> it's the `.sourceIndex` branch in Sizzle.uniqueSort
[09:24:37] <timmywil> I haven't
[09:24:39] <timmywil> ugh
[09:25:03] <timmywil> ok, we should fix that
[09:25:07] <gibson042> looks like we should just drop it since it doesn't work on a wholly-disconnected set
[09:25:51] <timmywil> hmmm, perhaps
[09:26:51] <timmywil> does it affect the sort order on a wholly-disconnected set?
[09:26:59] <gibson042> yes
[09:27:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's a pretty important one to fix for 1.9.1
[09:29:56] <DaveMethvin> sorry i have to run off in just a sec ... doing training to day and the class is starting again soon
[09:30:02] <gibson042> I can't believe the amount of noise over jQuery( whitespace + html )
[09:30:20] <DaveMethvin> see timmywil told me so
[09:30:43] <DaveMethvin> but the whole point was to avoid arbitrary html
[09:30:43] <gibson042> I still say hold firm, though
[09:30:51] <DaveMethvin> i think so
[09:30:54] <gibson042> do your own .trims, people!
[09:31:11] <timmywil> it's so easy to trim tho
[09:31:32] <DaveMethvin> but the point is that people are passing arbitrary stuff to $() so that is intended to avoid it
[09:31:35] <timmywil> eh, w/e
[09:31:52] <DaveMethvin> let's see how it goes, i think i need an article on it
[09:31:58] <DaveMethvin> kinda like the .data() stuff
[09:32:15] <DaveMethvin> the combo of the article plus the 1.8 tweaks seem to have but that one to bed
[09:32:55] <DaveMethvin> if you see any open tix that you could grab, please do so ... i'll make a pass through tonight
[09:33:09] <timmywil> we could probably take care of a lot of the arbitrary cases ourselves by trimming for them
[09:33:24] <timmywil> I think is my point
[09:33:45] <DaveMethvin>  but if someone is processing a template they should be using $.parseHTML
[09:33:57] <DaveMethvin> anything very complicated should do that
[09:34:02] <timmywil> true
[09:34:32] <timmywil> so, is the majority of the issues whitespace + html or are they passing vars to $() ?
[09:34:45] <timmywil> like are a lot of people doing $(" <html> ")
[09:34:56] <gibson042> no; it's vars
[09:35:05] <timmywil> oh, then stay strong
[09:35:17] <gibson042> from AJAX responses/embedded templates/etc.
[09:35:33] <timmywil> yea, that should be parseHTML. maybe we could put that in the migrate plugin?
[09:35:40] <gibson042> already done
[09:35:55] <DaveMethvin> and embedding html templates in js ... just EW
[09:35:55] <timmywil> oh, then what's the problem people??
[09:36:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's another todo i think we need the download page for 1.9 to push the migrate plugin
[09:36:02] <timmywil> :)
[09:36:14] <DaveMethvin> it's clear from the blog post but not if someone skips to the download
[09:36:19] <DaveMethvin> going to jquery.com
[09:36:25] <gibson042> the problem: 'it's completely ridiculous that jQuery won't trim the string before determining if it is "valid" html or not'
[09:36:26] <gibson042> :)
[09:36:50] <DaveMethvin> well if you know it's valid html, then ask us to parse it :P
[09:36:59] <timmywil> but the only use case is $(" <div/> ") right?
[09:37:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i don't see that being so common
[09:37:33] <DaveMethvin> sure there will be situations in code now, but the migrate plugin will warn about them
[09:38:15] <DaveMethvin> ok i gotta go
[09:38:39] <DaveMethvin> i should be doing stuff later tonight
[09:38:51] <DaveMethvin> doing training all this afternoon
[09:39:00] <DaveMethvin> so i'll close the door now ..
[09:39:02] <gibson042> ok; have fun
[09:39:10] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys!
