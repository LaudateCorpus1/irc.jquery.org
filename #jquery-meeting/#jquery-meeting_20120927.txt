[11:03:17] <toddmparker_> 1.2 Final ready for release - working on updating ThemeRoller, Download builder, website, etc. in preparation for launch in the next few days
[11:03:17] <toddmparker_> There will be another maintenance release for 1.1 (1.1.2) in the coming weeks. Timing TBD
[11:03:17] <toddmparker_> Roadmap for the next year close to complete, team to review after this meeting
[11:03:27] <toddmparker_> boom, that's it for me
[11:03:48] <uGoMobi> ok i'll go next
[11:03:51] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:03:58] <uGoMobi> have been  working on triage, docs and roadmap
[11:04:04] <uGoMobi> nothing to add to that
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> Q for 1.2 final release:
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> 2 old pages in docs (not linked anywhere) - delete?
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events-nav.html
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/mediahelpers.html
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> 2 outdated folders - exclude from zip if possible or delete?
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> css/themes/valencia
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> experiments/scrollview
[11:04:35] <toddmparker_> was thinking the same thing this mornign when i saw valencia
[11:04:43] <uGoMobi> always valencia ;)
[11:04:55] <uGoMobi> we have backups from previous releases
[11:05:03] <toddmparker_> I say yes
[11:05:05] <uGoMobi> so I suggest to delete
[11:05:12] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events-nav.html might be owrth keeping and finishing
[11:05:23] <toddmparker_> it was an attempt to clarify the nav event model stuff
[11:05:26] <toddmparker_> a nobile task
[11:05:32] <Wilto> Brave.
[11:05:47] <uGoMobi> what I can is make backup branch, after 1.2 release we can cleanup branches and see where we keep this
[11:05:49] <gseguin> hi
[11:05:50] <toddmparker_> but yes
[11:05:56] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:05:59] <uGoMobi> can do*
[11:06:03] <toddmparker_> i'd rather delete old junk
[11:06:09] <uGoMobi> I agree
[11:06:13] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:06:15] <uGoMobi> ok that's it for me... next
[11:06:19] <toddmparker_> anything else to report?
[11:06:22] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:06:24] <uGoMobi> nope
[11:06:43] <toddmparker_> johnbender?
[11:06:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: aqi
[11:07:07] <johnbender> mostly preso stuff this week
[11:07:19] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:07:19] <johnbender> I put that issue in place
[11:07:23] <johnbender> for the nav refactor
[11:07:27] <toddmparker_> did you stage up the build?
[11:07:29] <johnbender> ready to deploy this thing
[11:07:30] <johnbender> nope
[11:07:34] <johnbender> I can do that now if you want
[11:07:38] <toddmparker_> sure
[11:07:52] <toddmparker_> gseguin and tbenze need it for their updates
[11:08:17] <toddmparker_> we'll do a re-deploy right at the end to catch docs updates for the zip
[11:08:21] <gseguin> I can proceed once it's tagged
[11:08:34] <toddmparker_> ah, o
[11:08:48] <toddmparker_> think TR can be done earlier?
[11:09:07] <toddmparker_> i'll follow up
[11:09:20] <toddmparker_> gseguin: what else is on your radar?
[11:09:45] <gseguin> Adding handling of semver tags in the post_receive handler of the builder
[11:09:57] <gseguin> to remove one manual step when releasing
[11:09:57] <toddmparker_> automation!
[11:10:01] <toddmparker_> i like
[11:10:04] <gseguin> FTW!
