[11:01:13] <toddparker> Hi everyone
[11:01:16] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:20] <gseguin> hello
[11:01:27] <toddparker> The jQuery Mobile Team meeting is now starting
[11:01:37] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:01:44] <uGoMobi2> hi
[11:01:44] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:01:49] <toddparker> chime in if you're here
[11:02:34] <toddparker> will john bender be joining?
[11:02:38] <JasonDScott> Hello
[11:02:40] <johnbender> oh he will
[11:02:44] <toddparker> hi!
[11:02:45] <uGoMobi2> lol
[11:03:11] <toddparker> cool
[11:03:14] <toddparker> gang's all here
[11:03:26] <toddparker> Ok, I'll start with some general project updates
[11:03:45] <toddparker> People have been asking about stats of use for jQuery Mobile
[11:03:47] <toddparker> Web stats for jquerymobile.com
[11:03:47] <toddparker>    Monthly: ~1 million pageviews/month, 750 unique
[11:03:48] <toddparker>    Last 2 years: 14 million views, 10m unique
[11:03:56] <toddparker> so we have some solid traffic
[11:04:03] <toddparker> lots of international traffic: Japan, Germany, China, etc.
[11:04:18] <toddparker> That is most interesting
[11:04:38] <toddparker> our broad compatibility really helps us internationally
[11:05:07] <toddparker> Next: Todd to work on device donation page - not done
[11:05:11] <toddparker> (sorry)
[11:05:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: 750 unique? You must mean 750k unique, right?
[11:05:23] <toddparker> heh, yes
[11:05:28] <toddparker> New jQM site re-design to fit into the new jQuery template - had walkthrough with Richard Worth, need access and training for Anne and Todd at a minimum. Who else wants to help with new site?
[11:05:53] <toddparker> Let me know if you want to help with the site re-work
[11:06:10] <toddparker> goal is to launch by SF conference in the new look and feel
[11:06:11] <uGoMobi2> would like to help with that
[11:06:23] <toddparker> yeah? great!
[11:06:34] <toddparker> Richard will get us details on the workflow
[11:06:40] <johnbender> toddparker: nice
[11:06:50] <toddparker> it all happens in GitHub and it published via Wordpress
[11:06:55] <toddparker> much better template
[11:07:00] <johnbender> is it markdown
[11:07:01] <johnbender> ?
[11:07:04] <johnbender> nevermind
[11:07:09] <johnbender> I can find out for myself later
[11:07:10] <johnbender> proceed
[11:07:20] * johnbender prevents himself from bogging down the meeting
[11:07:34] <toddparker> it can be markdown
[11:07:54] <toddparker> ultimately, each page/post must be HTML + some meta data in JSON
[11:08:16] <toddparker> we can use markdown and transform
[11:08:40] <toddparker> Richard will get us access to repos and they hope to import existing content from WP for cleanup
[11:08:46] <toddparker> will need a lot of CSS love
[11:08:53] <toddparker> more on this soon
[11:09:09] <toddparker> Lastly - Can we do affiliate books sales for project cash?
[11:09:18] <johnbender> that was me
[11:09:21] <toddparker> I will ask around for details.
[11:09:27] <johnbender> seems like a no brainer but I don't know how to set it up
[11:09:40] <johnbender> that is, the decision is a no brainer
[11:09:44] <johnbender> the setup is not
[11:09:53] <toddparker> I know the jQ project is planning on having a place to store info on all books
[11:10:08] <toddparker> sure there will be affiliate stuff baked in there, part of the new design
[11:10:14] <toddparker> will check that
[11:10:22] <agcolom> sorry my browser is super slow... just to let you know the new docs site is in XML and transformed to HTML using XSLT (like UI and Core)
[11:10:22] <johnbender> cool
[11:10:35] <johnbender> shweet
[11:10:59] <toddparker> yeah, anne
[11:11:00] <uGoMobi2> is this one and the same project?
[11:11:10] <toddparker> want to give an update on docs?
[11:11:19] <agcolom> So all components have to conform to a strict standard
[11:11:22] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: separate, but related
[11:11:25] <uGoMobi2> ok
[11:11:49] <_|Nix|_> Who's next?
[11:11:56] <toddparker> go for it
[11:11:58] <agcolom> Yes, this is I understand for widget/elements
[11:12:10] <_|Nix|_> OK ... so:
[11:12:28] <_|Nix|_> I rolled back the previous fix for the initial-page-has-dialog-hash and made a cleaner one
[11:12:36] <_|Nix|_> It supports dialogs and popups off the start page.
[11:12:56] <johnbender> sweet
[11:13:06] <agcolom> I've started with dialogs. For each we need description , options, events, methods and theming
[11:13:08] <johnbender> is there a PR or a change set I can check out?
[11:13:09] <_|Nix|_> I implemented lazy-updating for the slider input ( max once / 100 ms ) but it doesn't seem to improve performance.
[11:13:23] <uGoMobi2> i think Anne was still updating us on docs
[11:13:36] <toddparker> was the slider fix an attempt to make it slide smoother, esp on android
[11:13:47] * johnbender defers to anne
[11:13:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... 09232df7abcac8c673dc955c4c098f9723fe384f 659e936f0030ce69521562647b53f24fa19fe423
[11:13:58] <toddparker> sorry agcolom, thought you might be done :)
[11:14:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, but man ... it's really slow.
[11:14:38] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Even a simple absolute div dragged across the page is slow - nm a slider, with aria-data and input data and all that.
[11:14:45] <toddparker> on the docs, we are essentially going to be taking our static html docs and porting them into a well structured XML format so people can do whatever they want with 'em
[11:15:07] <toddparker> we can then use this XML to re-create something like the current docs, but hopefully much better
[11:15:30] <uGoMobi2> ok so we can pull that into the new wordpress site as well
[11:15:33] <toddparker> starting with the dialog to get the kinks worked out sounds good to me
[11:15:56] <toddparker> there will be a separate api "site" like api.jquerymobile.com
[11:16:09] <toddparker> it will be linked up from the jQM site and feel integrated
[11:16:10] <_|Nix|_> I'd like to talk about a few things, if we have time: 1. Do we want buttons to be able to change theme on-the-fly? #4317 2. #4340 It seems we can comment out the blur-all-other-buttons-line to improve list performance, because sloppy highlights were not found in an extensive test.
[11:16:20] <toddparker> sort of how the jQ core API docs are now
[11:16:26] <uGoMobi2> ok clear
[11:16:30] <toddparker> hold on _|Nix|_ - still finishing up docs
[11:16:30] <_|Nix|_> I'm done.
[11:16:35] <toddparker> heh
[11:16:46] <toddparker> soâ€¦any other Q's about docs?
[11:16:59] <toddparker> looking for help here too. lots of work to port these over
[11:17:26] <toddparker> we might be able to use some Filament interns to help a bit
[11:17:32] <agcolom> just if someone has time to give me info on events and methods for dialogs (see basecamp post)
[11:17:47] <agcolom> that would be great :-) Thank you :-)
[11:17:57] <toddparker> anyone able to help with that?
[11:18:15] <johnbender> I can lend a hand between prs and issues
[11:18:30] <toddparker> ok, thanks johnbender
[11:18:36] <toddparker> ok, next!
[11:18:42] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: back to your updates
[11:19:01] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'm done.
[11:19:09] <toddparker> did you land initial-page-has-dialog-hash in master?
[11:19:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yep.
[11:19:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... and in 1.1-stable.
[11:19:25] <toddparker> cool
[11:19:43] <toddparker> on  lazy-updating for the slider input - was this to smooth out the drag responsiveness?
[11:19:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, but not much good.
[11:20:03] <toddparker> sounds like the input updating wasn't the cuprit then?
[11:20:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I couldn't notice a difference ...
[11:20:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I don't think so.
[11:20:38] <toddparker> might just be android's events are yucky
[11:20:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: A page with an even slightly non-trivial layout has abysmal performance under a tight mousemove sequence.
[11:20:44] <toddparker> anyone seen a smooth slider on android?
[11:21:03] <toddparker> (crickets)
[11:21:12] <uGoMobi2> not that i recall
[11:21:21] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: if you post a short URL we can test here on a few devices
[11:21:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The native one, maybe :)
[11:21:24] <toddparker> to compare
[11:21:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK ... I'll whip up the commit and put it up on babulina.
[11:21:46] <toddparker> but otherwise, we can abandon this approach if it's not better
[11:21:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: oK.
[11:22:33] <toddparker> any other slider issues worth looking at while you're heads in there?
[11:22:47] <toddparker> might be worth a quick search, esp if there are 1.1.1 or 1.2 issues tagged for slider
[11:23:24] <toddparker> let's talk about your other 2 items in a follow up after this
[11:23:26] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Haven't really looked, and now I'm into doing the unit tests for the initial-page-has-dialog-hash ...
[11:23:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK.
[11:23:32] <toddparker> ok
[11:23:36] <toddparker> who's next?
[11:23:44] <gseguin> I can go
[11:24:07] <gseguin> Decoupled events code
[11:24:28] <gseguin> and started re-organizing the code
[11:24:36] <gseguin> created js/events
[11:24:52] <gseguin> had to fix the builder service to handle that
[11:25:08] <gseguin> Discovered a circular dependency
[11:25:11] <toddparker> yeah?
[11:25:16] * johnbender raises his hand!
[11:25:17] <gseguin> which was causing the builder service to crash
[11:25:22] <johnbender> that was me
[11:25:24] <johnbender> :D
[11:25:36] <toddparker> nice one johnbender
[11:25:38] <uGoMobi2> congrats :)
[11:25:38] <gseguin> fixed the service so that doesn't happen again
[11:25:48] <toddparker> bender-proofed
[11:25:50] <gseguin> and fixed the circular dependency
[11:26:03] <johnbender> yah it was a hold over from the refactor
[11:26:05] <gseguin> :D
[11:26:05] <johnbender> :(
[11:26:24] <toddparker> so gseguin - do you foresee any ripples with moving the JS into folders?
[11:26:29] <toddparker> just curious
[11:26:40] <gseguin> not anymore
[11:27:00] <toddparker> because of the builder fixes?
[11:27:04] <gseguin> besides people not being happy with the new directory structure
[11:27:10] <toddparker> who?
[11:27:30] <gseguin> I don't know, raise your hand if you don't like having subdir under js
[11:27:42] <toddparker> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/2989804_700b.jpg
[11:27:54] <gseguin> :)
[11:27:56] <uGoMobi2> lol
[11:27:57] <toddparker> bueller?
[11:28:13] <toddparker> no objections?
[11:28:20] <toddparker> guess it's unanimous
[11:28:20] <gseguin> alright I guess no one is ferociously opposed to it
[11:28:24] <toddparker> heh
[11:28:34] <gseguin> so I'll continue doing that
[11:28:44] <uGoMobi2> i am very much in favor of it
[11:28:45] <gseguin> for transition and forms widget
[11:29:12] <toddparker> yeah, too many files
[11:29:14] <toddparker> ok
[11:29:16] <toddparker> great
[11:29:20] <uGoMobi2> all i was wondering is what happens with open PR's
[11:29:21] <gseguin> then we may have to do it for css, we'll see
[11:29:29] <toddparker> so the download builder is now 100% and just needs extra testing?
[11:29:31] <uGoMobi2> conflicts when trying to merge?
[11:29:35] <gseguin> to match the directory structure
[11:29:37] <toddparker> good point
[11:29:54] <toddparker> is that a problem?
[11:30:03] <gseguin> toddparker: it's definitely in a very testable shape
[11:30:09] <toddparker> thought johnbender cleared out every last PR
[11:30:11] <toddparker> cool
[11:30:17] <johnbender> lol
[11:30:18] <toddparker> all - please test
[11:30:22] <johnbender> not quite
[11:30:28] <johnbender> yes
[11:30:28] <toddparker> what's so funny johnbender?
[11:30:33] <johnbender> every last pr
[11:30:44] <toddparker> hey, you promised
[11:30:50] <johnbender> hopefully we'll get there
[11:30:54] <gseguin> worst case we'll have some manual merging to do
[11:30:56] <toddparker> issue list is still getting smaller BTW
[11:30:58] <johnbender> talk to wilt to and scott
[11:30:59] <johnbender> ?:D
[11:31:00] <bot-t> http://i.imgur.com/HNXTm.jpg
[11:31:02] <gseguin> I'm not too worried about that
[11:31:04] <toddparker> ok, if you're not worried about it
[11:31:05] <johnbender> lots of css/style related prs
[11:31:11] <_|Nix|_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jqm-lazy-slider/slider.html
[11:31:34] <toddparker> yeah, uGoMobi2 hopefully can give those a look. he is thorough.
[11:32:17] <uGoMobi2> just let me know which ones you want me to review
[11:32:31] <gseguin> that's it for me
[11:32:40] <toddparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[11:32:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi2: any assigned to scott or wilto
[11:32:46] <johnbender> :D
[11:32:49] <toddparker> where should we add comments on that URL?
[11:32:52] <toddparker> ticket?
[11:32:53] <uGoMobi2> my own PR's are ;)
[11:33:02] <johnbender> yerp
[11:33:06] <toddparker> yeah, uGoMobi2 = scott + mat
[11:33:13] <uGoMobi2> assigned to them i mean
[11:33:21] <johnbender> toddparker: we need someone to get another set of eyes on his prs too though
[11:33:25] <toddparker> they are slammed right now unfortunately. their boss is a jerk
[11:33:27] <toddparker> (me)
[11:33:31] <johnbender> fully realizing that you guys have a business to run
[11:33:35] <toddparker> uGoMobi2's?
[11:33:39] <johnbender> yah
[11:33:50] <uGoMobi2> my turn?
[11:33:53] <toddparker> yep, we're going to test the heck out of his epic button PR today
[11:33:58] <johnbender> yay!
[11:33:59] <toddparker> actually, testing now
[11:34:10] <toddparker> horray for interns and adobe shadow
[11:34:15] <toddparker> sure uGoMobi2
[11:34:18] <uGoMobi2> yeah well thats what i have been working on
[11:34:27] <toddparker> that is some amazing work
[11:34:35] <toddparker> http://ugomobi.github.com/buttons-form/
[11:34:36] <uGoMobi2> select unit test gives one error btw
[11:34:39] <uGoMobi2> will check that
[11:34:51] <toddparker> those test pages and the ability to quickly compare with master is very helpful
[11:35:00] <toddparker> in my first pass, the changes look great
[11:35:07] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[11:35:13] <gseguin> very nice uGoMobi2
[11:35:17] <toddparker> if this looks ok, we'll green button it
[11:35:19] <uGoMobi2> and i have been reading the open PR's and issue thread regarding updatePagePadding / fixed toolbars
[11:35:31] <toddparker> right, and...
[11:35:34] <uGoMobi2> thanks
[11:36:17] <toddparker> you're just digging into that stuff now, right?
[11:36:20] <toddparker> any Q's for us?
[11:36:30] <uGoMobi2> i think half can be fixed by css
[11:36:47] <toddparker> seems like at a minimum, we can set the static default padding to line up better with the default toolbar. seems off by a few px
[11:36:54] <toddparker> then there are all the other issues
[11:36:58] <toddparker> good to hear
[11:37:01] <uGoMobi2> not yet... going to start some test with proposed fixes
[11:37:02] <toddparker> the less JS, the better
[11:37:06] <uGoMobi2> see how far i get
[11:37:08] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:37:12] <toddparker> we're here to test
[11:37:16] <toddparker> just hit us with URLs
[11:37:18] <uGoMobi2> and then come back to you guys
[11:37:19] <toddparker> ok
[11:37:40] <uGoMobi2> thats it for me
[11:37:50] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[11:37:50] <toddparker> scott - Slow lists issue - Scott suggested a fix in the issue, Kin will review tonight
[11:38:01] <toddparker> don't think kinblas had a chance to look at it
[11:38:14] <toddparker> this is the issue _|Nix|_ mentioned earlier
[11:38:24] <toddparker> right?
[11:38:59] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: IIRC he did, and he thought that it might be worth commenting out the line. dcarrith tested the commented out version on a bunch of devices - all clear.
[11:39:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That's why I'm thinking we might want to comment out that line, and see if the world collapses.
[11:39:31] <toddparker> seems like this we should make the change
[11:39:34] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We can always put it back in if any smoking guns appear on the horizon.
[11:39:38] <toddparker> scott seemed to think so too
[11:39:40] <toddparker> yeah
[11:39:54] <toddparker> if it's landed in master, we will see if something crops up easier
[11:40:01] <toddparker> i say land it
[11:40:01] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[11:40:10] <toddparker> and pick it into 1.1-stable
[11:40:14] <gseguin> ?shipit
[11:40:14] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/button.gif
[11:40:56] <toddparker> what is the link to that issue/PR
[11:41:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340#issuecomment-6119281
[11:41:21] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #4340 on jquery-mobile (mruffolo; 3w, 6d ago): slow response when clicking item in large listview on mobile devices
[11:41:58] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: can you easily benchmark the list perf for clicks on the "list perf page" with 300+ items for 1.0.1, 1.1.0 and master post this change
[11:42:07] <toddparker> i want to see if we're back to where we were
[11:42:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK ... I can give it a shot.
[11:42:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we have existing perf stuff
[11:42:40] <johnbender> but it's in the website repo
[11:42:47] <johnbender> for the list perf
[11:42:48] <toddparker> yeah, mind pointing him to the tools johnbender
[11:42:54] <johnbender> sure
[11:43:05] <_|Nix|_> Alright ... tools!
[11:43:06] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:43:07] <toddparker> this is the biggest issue for 1.1.1
[11:43:17] <toddparker> so be good to know if we're ok again for sure
[11:43:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: don't get too excited they are fairly rudimentary
[11:43:38] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:43:59] <toddparker> heh
[11:44:03] <toddparker> alrighty
[11:44:11] <toddparker> JasonDScott: want to go?
[11:44:20] <JasonDScott> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2159 - working on a fix that is not specific to BB
[11:44:20] <JasonDScott> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4001 - Still working on solution for all platforms
[11:44:21] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #4001 on jquery-mobile (jasondscott; 1m, 3w ago): Page flashes after transition is complete on BlackBerry 7.1
[11:44:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/tree/master/speed
[11:44:25] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2159 on jquery-mobile (robberry; 10m, 1w ago): Navbar wrapping on Blackberry OS 5
[11:44:37] <JasonDScott> Both of these issues are BB specific
[11:45:03] <toddparker> boo
[11:45:12] <JasonDScott> I have fixes that work on the BB but break other platforms so I am still trying to find the right fix for all
[11:45:16] <toddparker> kidding
[11:45:33] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2159
[11:45:33] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2159 on jquery-mobile (robberry; 10m, 1w ago): Navbar wrapping on Blackberry OS 5
[11:45:37] <toddparker> box model tomfoolery
[11:45:51] <uGoMobi2> JasonDScott: #2159 navbar issue is same as IE7 i think
[11:45:51] <JasonDScott> ?
[11:46:10] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: maybe you can work with JasonDScott on this when you finish up those other CSS items
[11:46:15] <JasonDScott> I will look into the IE7 one too
[11:46:42] <toddparker> widths are calculated wrong for some reason on BB5?
[11:46:44] <uGoMobi2> i references the related issues there (#2159)
[11:46:53] <JasonDScott> toddparker: we talked about not putting in the backface visibility in css, could we do it bb specific in js
[11:46:53] <JasonDScott> ?
[11:47:00] <toddparker> grids don't have padding or margin so I have no ideas why the float would break
[11:47:12] <uGoMobi2> subpixel problem
[11:47:22] <toddparker> ah, fun
[11:47:25] <JasonDScott> It is odd, adding a border fixes the problem
[11:47:32] <JasonDScott> and it is not an issue in the header
[11:47:33] <uGoMobi2> round up the % width of the grid block
[11:47:56] <uGoMobi2> its an issue everywhere where you use the navbar
[11:47:59] <toddparker> so 50% rounds up to...
[11:48:18] <uGoMobi2> depends on total available width
[11:48:27] <toddparker> seems like BB needs it to sum to less than 100%
[11:48:29] <uGoMobi2> if that is an odd number of pixels
[11:48:35] <toddparker> gotcha
[11:48:40] <uGoMobi2> on BB5 because a 5px scrollbar maybe
[11:49:16] <toddparker> so it the screen is 401 pixels, it calculates the width to be 201 x 2 = 402 = broken float?
[11:49:28] <uGoMobi2> exactly
[11:49:33] <toddparker> smart
[11:49:51] <toddparker> so this is a Q in general
[11:50:02] <uGoMobi2> and all other browsers leave a gap because they prevent the wrapping
[11:50:02] <toddparker> i don't want to add JS like this ticket suggests
[11:50:08] <uGoMobi2> thats another open issue :)
[11:50:11] <johnbender> http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/charting_v2/visualize.jQuery.jsFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403
[11:50:14] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[11:50:15] <johnbender> boo!
[11:50:18] <uGoMobi2> no JS and no tables!
[11:50:41] <uGoMobi2> i was thinking of using a pseudo selector that BB5 and IE7 dont understand
[11:50:41] <toddparker> we can consider adding a class somewhere for BB% that would allow styles to be scoped like this
[11:50:47] <uGoMobi2> to make adjustments
[11:50:48] <toddparker> but it's pretty tacky/ugly
[11:51:00] <toddparker> that would be ideal uGoMobi2
[11:51:10] <uGoMobi2> :last-child for example
[11:51:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I get that file ...
[11:51:23] <toddparker> JasonDScott: can you see if there is something we could scope against that would only work in BB5?
[11:51:30] <johnbender> orly
[11:51:43] <toddparker> actually, what uGoMobi2 said is better
[11:51:58] <toddparker> so we set the core styles to be on the small side
[11:52:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: very very odd
[11:52:11] <uGoMobi2> JasonDScott already had a look at BB developers site at what css selectors BB5 supports
[11:52:16] <toddparker> then "fix" it to the correct widths in newer/better browsers
[11:52:16] <uGoMobi2> but its not complete
[11:52:27] <uGoMobi2> you have complete list?
[11:52:30] <toddparker> :/
[11:52:46] <toddparker> just concerned about adding a lot of cruft here for old browsers
[11:52:52] <toddparker> so we should tread lightly
[11:53:18] <uGoMobi2> i agree
[11:53:19] <toddparker> though I wonder if we could just set this to be a bit small across the board and it would round up on better browsers?
[11:53:28] <toddparker> worht trying
[11:54:07] <toddparker> if you want to make a test page JasonDScott that sets the widths of the various grids to be as close to the whole number while still not wrapping in IE 7 and BB5, I can test
[11:54:30] <toddparker> we need a text page that lets us easily see if there is 1px left of on the right
[11:54:32] <JasonDScott> Ok
[11:55:39] <toddparker> cool
[11:55:41] <toddparker> last item
[11:55:44] <uGoMobi2> the issue with the gap after last button can be solved with negative margin on the button (not the grid block) maybe
[11:56:03] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4001
[11:56:03] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #4001 on jquery-mobile (jasondscott; 1m, 3w ago): Page flashes after transition is complete on BlackBerry 7.1
[11:56:16] <toddparker> good idea uGoMobi2
[11:56:36] <toddparker> on the flashing issue, this still needs a look across the board to see if we can improve this
[11:56:50] <toddparker> hoping to get scott jehl's eyes on this and the fixed toolbar jumping issue soon
[11:56:59] <toddparker> let's wait on this for now
[11:57:18] <toddparker> you can add the note about back face to the docs if you haven't already jason
[11:57:30] <toddparker> but let's wait on and CSS/JS changes for now
[11:57:40] <toddparker> maybe we can fix this for everyone by giving it a fresh look
[11:57:46] <JasonDScott> Ok, which page on the docs? transitons?
[11:58:02] <toddparker> yes, think that's the best place for it
[11:58:21] <toddparker> find a place halfway down for a H2 and sentence or two
[11:58:45] <JasonDScott> Should it be BB specific or to fix the flash in general
[11:58:47] <JasonDScott> ?
[11:58:50] <toddparker> this can be stated broadly - this may improve smoothness or flashing across browsers, but test for memory issues
[11:59:03] <JasonDScott> Ok
[11:59:08] <toddparker> you could even create a demo page that copies the transition page and adds that style rule to the head
[11:59:23] <toddparker> you'd need to link to it via rel=external
[11:59:29] <toddparker> to force the rule into play
[11:59:44] <toddparker> link to that from the blurb for easy testing/demoing
[12:00:13] <toddparker> ok, looks like we used a full hour but this was a great checkin everyone
[12:00:48] <toddparker> i'll look thru the 1.1.1 issues to see if we need to hunker down on any specific ones
[12:01:04] <toddparker> let's shoot to have 1.1.1 in good shaper in a week if we can
[12:01:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The only outstanding thing for me is #4317 (make theme work on-the-fly for buttons).
[12:01:15] <toddparker> i may move some issues forward to winnow the list down
[12:01:15] <uGoMobi2> johnbender no update from you?
[12:01:23] <toddparker> ah, sorry johnbender
[12:01:26] <johnbender> no worries
[12:01:36] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Can you please milestone that issue?
[12:01:36] <johnbender> I'm just doing the junit grunt plugin
[12:01:40] <johnbender> then moving on to prs and issues
[12:01:46] <johnbender> nothing worth noting
[12:01:56] <uGoMobi2> very useful though :)
[12:01:58] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: for 1.2?
[12:02:10] <toddparker> ok, well that all good stuff
[12:02:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: For whichever you think is appropriate ...
[12:02:22] <toddparker> 1.2 at the soonest
[12:02:27] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So be it.
[12:02:32] <uGoMobi2> toddparker: _|Nix|_ is not in basecamp group
[12:02:58] <uGoMobi2> for email notifications
[12:02:58] <johnbender> oh! and I'm going to clean out the branches today
[12:03:07] <johnbender> so speak now or forever loose the remote branch
[12:03:08] <uGoMobi2> hehe great
[12:03:14] <johnbender> (obviously you have local copies)
[12:03:59] <toddparker> tagged that _|Nix|_
[12:04:08] <toddparker> oh, i'll add you _|Nix|_
[12:04:10] <toddparker> sorry
[12:04:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: NP.
[12:04:18] <toddparker> clean away johnbender
[12:04:25] <toddparker> ok
[12:04:32] <toddparker> before we sign off, any Q's from the community?
[12:05:07] <johnbender> ^^^^^^

[12:05:28] <uGoMobi2> while we wait for that... ok if I pull this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4385
[12:05:29] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (2w, 6d ago): Link styling (theme.css)
[12:06:18] <toddparker> yes, i think so uGoMobi2
[12:06:25] <toddparker> that is a good defensive move
[12:06:31] <toddparker> i'd do it only for 1.2 (master)
[12:06:42] <toddparker> just because it's a bigger change
[12:06:47] <toddparker> to the theme css
[12:07:08] <toddparker> ok, sounds like no questions. anything else before we sign off?
[12:07:18] <_|Nix|_> I'm good.
