[20:15:23] <bkoltai> Hi jQuery members! I have a problem that I am sure has been solved already but cannot find the answer. I have a collection of divs that each live in a container div. Each div has a specific (not general) width, relative positioning, and a left position. I want to position the divs such that, if they were all positioned absolutely, none would overlap, but they would take up as little vertical space as possible.
[20:15:23] <bkoltai> Specifically, if a div at the top of the container has a width of 5px, and the next div has a width of 5px but left orientation of 6px, the second div would align 1px to the right of the first div, on the same horizontal position.
