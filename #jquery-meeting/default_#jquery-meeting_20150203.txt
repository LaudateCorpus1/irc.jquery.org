[10:05:33] <b-ot> markelog: From rwaldron, 20h 30m ago: thanks for the run-down on velocity.js, much appreciated.
[10:06:02] <markelog> )
[10:07:10] <isaacdurazo> hey sfrisk
[10:07:43] <sfrisk> hey, wasn't sure if you wanted an invite to the css chassis meeting or not.  But everyone should check out the logo you're working on!
[10:08:01] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/27#issuecomment-71592280
[10:08:24] <ianmaffett> nice!
[10:08:55] <isaacdurazo> sfrisk unfortunately I can't join the meeting at this time :/
[10:09:02] <sfrisk> that's fine!
[10:09:04] <isaacdurazo> I'm in the middle of something
[10:09:09] <sfrisk> Totally understandable
[10:09:30] <isaacdurazo> I'm gonna post more updates either tonight or tomorrow
[10:09:35] <sfrisk> Sounds good.
[10:09:47] <arschmitz> isaacdurazo: Awesome!
[10:10:58] <markelog> looks promising!
[10:11:21] <sfrisk> So SVG placeholder PR is ready to be pulled in, I think we're just waiting on name tweak so it passes contributor checks
[10:11:42] <marestad> Yep. I have a few questions about the name tweak after this meeting.
[10:12:01] <sfrisk> arschmitz is a good person to talk to about that
[10:12:09] <marestad> Cool.
[10:12:15] <arschmitz> marestad: yeah any questions i can answer
[10:12:24] <marestad> Thanks. :)
[10:12:32] <arschmitz> just pm me or in #css-chassis
[10:13:03] <sfrisk> I suggest everyone check out marestad's initial Sass file structure PR https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/33
[10:13:22] <sfrisk> It's about ready to be pulled in at this point I think, but the more eyes on it, the better!
[10:14:07] <arschmitz> unless anyone has any further comments / concerns i can land that one when i do the svg one
[10:15:00] <sfrisk> Yeah, any concerns I had have been addressed at this point
[10:15:05] <sfrisk> Same with arschmitz
[10:15:09] <sfrisk> (I assume)
[10:15:46] <arschmitz> yup
[10:16:41] <sfrisk> How goes perf testing, arschmitz?
[10:17:13] <arschmitz> Good
[10:17:28] <arschmitz> need to finish moving things to a nice url and permenant server
[10:17:58] <arschmitz> and the creator of perfjankie wants to use all our feedback
[10:18:06] <arschmitz> but is busy so wants me to do the pr's for it lol
[10:18:13] <arschmitz> so i dont know exactly when i will get to those
[10:21:10] <sfrisk> There is a PR for the work arschmitz is doing if anyone wants to check it out https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/34
[10:22:07] <sfrisk> Okay, so I really only have two things left of my list for this week - although once initial file structure lands, we can start moving ahead on a lot of items
[10:22:46] <marestad> Yep.
[10:23:05] <sfrisk> First thing is Mailing List. I can create a google groups for Chassis if people want for non issue specific related discussion
[10:23:45] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/13
[10:24:54] <sfrisk> Figured I would just settle it here once and for all if we want this, so I can close out the issue.
[10:25:28] <arschmitz> The original intent was for a private not a public mailing list
[10:25:32] <sfrisk> yes
[10:25:36] <marestad> Would a private blog/forum be better? I just find following mailing list conversations to be pretty disjointed.
[10:26:44] <arschmitz> blog does not really make sense to me maybe im not clear on how it would be used
[10:26:56] <arschmitz> and a forum seems like a lot of work but im open
[10:26:59] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm trying to add caitp to this call, no dice
[10:27:24] <arschmitz> rwaldron: try #jquery-dev :-)
[10:27:26] <rwaldron> (sorry, wrong channel)
[10:27:33] <sfrisk> rwaldron It's okay!
[10:27:38] <rwaldron> (they are right next to eachother :| )
[10:27:44] <sfrisk> (it happens)
[10:27:51] <marestad> arschmitz: I can show you a demo of what I have in mind for a blog after.
[10:27:51] <sfrisk> (I've done it a few times too)
[10:28:00] <sfrisk> I think the layout of a google group is kinda forum like? (if you go to the group itself)
[10:28:06] <arschmitz> rwaldron: since the majority of people here are from main we will forgive :-)
[10:28:15] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yeah kinda
[10:28:23] <marestad> sfrisk: That's true.
[10:28:42] <arschmitz> and it still works like a mailing list essentially
[10:28:55] <sfrisk> So if you're not a fan of the email format - you can just look at it via google groups
[10:29:22] <arschmitz> yup
[10:29:23] <marestad> True.
[10:30:53] <sfrisk> Okay, so I'll assign that issue to me and I'll set that up
[10:31:04] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:32:10] <sfrisk> Okay, so I noticed some discussion happening around visual regression testing
[10:32:45] <sfrisk> and markelog, you were thinking about trying out Gemini on Bootstrap for testing?
[10:32:55] <markelog> yeah,
[10:33:02] <markelog> waiting for mdo response
[10:33:10] <markelog> not sure if it will ever come though
[10:33:36] <sfrisk> well, it might be a good way of figuring out if Gemini will work for us, while we work up to having css to test with
[10:34:03] <markelog> Both webdrivercss and gemini are good candidates, pretty sure they would do the job
[10:34:26] <markelog> but it would be better to have a good example
[10:34:33] <sfrisk> Definitely.
[10:34:49] <markelog> so when our thing would have something to test we would have clear path how to do it
[10:34:58] <sfrisk> Well, if you have time and want to get a working example going, that would be awesome.
[10:35:16] <markelog> I will try to get some time )
[10:35:22] <sfrisk> :-)
[10:36:24] <sfrisk> Okay, so that was everything on my list that I had as a "needs to get discussed"
[10:36:55] <sfrisk> anyone else have anything they would like to bring up?
[10:38:04] <marestad> Not at the moment. I'm pretty eager to get the file structure PR merged in so we can start in on some of the issues.
[10:38:12] <sfrisk> Definitely, me too!
[10:38:21] <sfrisk> I'm itching to do some coding :-)
[10:38:25] <arschmitz> im good
[10:38:27] <marestad> Just got a few more comments on it. Not any drastic changes, though.
[10:39:03] <sfrisk> Okay then, I guess we're done early then.
[10:39:14] <marestad> Cool.
[10:39:30] <sfrisk> See you guys next week, and until then, in various issues/PRs
