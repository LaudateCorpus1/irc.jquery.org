[09:01:32] <jzaefferer> Testing Meeting! Ping scott_gonzalez rwaldron DaveMethvin Krinkle|detached xavier_ rworth
[09:01:58] <DaveMethvin> here
[09:03:26] <jzaefferer> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FbWhiFQ9gWQvB1Tm4QM_OC4me-ha2ujDWH5sdF7ueo/edit?pli=1
[09:03:29] <jzaefferer> rather empty...
[09:03:46] <jzaefferer> was very much hoping for input from rworth and Krinkle|detached
[09:03:50] <jzaefferer> looks like neither are around
[09:04:11] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: is BrowserStack okay these days?
[09:04:21] <DaveMethvin> just pinged them about some chrome issues
[09:04:22] <DaveMethvin> heard back today
[09:04:28] <DaveMethvin> they are supposed to fix them
[09:04:32] <DaveMethvin> i think there's like one guy
[09:04:37] <DaveMethvin> who does all the work
[09:05:01] <jzaefferer> aye, okay
[09:05:52] <DaveMethvin> otherwise, all quiet on the testing front for me
[09:06:07] <DaveMethvin> updated to qunit 1.10
[09:06:26] <DaveMethvin> had to fix a couple of problems with our selectors, they were grabbing the new select box
[09:06:38] <DaveMethvin> but those were probs on our side
[09:07:41] <jzaefferer> ah, I guess that happens whenever QUnit's markup changes...
[09:07:54] <DaveMethvin> well only if we were using a whole-page search
[09:08:05] <DaveMethvin> and really it shoudl have been in #qunit-fixture
[09:08:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did you ever hear back from node people on https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/190 ?
[09:08:48] <jzaefferer> apart from that one, I don't have any QUnit stuff to discuss. Mostly just needs implementation work
[09:08:54] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: did you talk to mikesherov about the bot they use for testing pull requests? i think he talked to gnarf about it
[09:09:02] <jzaefferer> Nope, I didn't
[09:09:13] <jzaefferer> Ah, yeah, forgot to ping gnarf in here :-)
[09:09:15] <DaveMethvin> seemed interesting, like botio but perhaps better
[09:10:09] <DaveMethvin> well i'm good, so just ping me if you need anything ... thanks for keeping the testing stuff in order
[09:10:30] <jzaefferer> okay, I'll chat with gnarf or mike, whoever is around first
[09:10:34] <jzaefferer> thanks Dave
[09:14:55] <rworth> sorry I'm late
[09:15:14] <rworth> jzaefferer still around?
[09:15:18] <jzaefferer> hey
[09:15:29] <jzaefferer> I am, but I don't think anyone else is
[09:15:34] <rworth> ok
[09:17:47] <rworth> I'm back to where I was a week or two ago, which is I think I might be able to put a little time into https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/187
[09:18:13] <rworth> I'm interested in helping beyond that if I'm able, but I won't know for a couple days what my schedule is like
[09:20:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: jzaefferer: I'm gonna try to stage it up next week
[09:20:34] <gnarf> looks pretty awesome tho
[09:21:18] <jzaefferer> gnarf: what was the repo?
[09:21:29] <gnarf> SnapInteractive/mergeatron
[09:21:37] <gnarf> link in UI notes from yesterday
[09:23:40] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:25:30] <jzaefferer> actually there is no link, also not in the leads doc
[09:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, was downstairs eating lunch. I need to get this on my calendar now that we have regular meetings.
[09:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't hear anything back, I'll ping them again.
[09:30:13] * scott_gonzalez updates calendar with repeating event...
[09:31:07] <jzaefferer> meeting("testing", function() { stop(); waitForPeopleToRespond(function() { start(); }) });
[09:32:00] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[09:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> With old and busted Firefox gone, you don't even need the anonymous function wrapping start() ;-)
[09:39:48] <jzaefferer> true!
[10:10:43] <xavier_> jzaefferer, oh oh I need to schedule this one
[11:00:46] <todd_> Hi all
[11:00:55] <todd_> the jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:01:03] <todd_> chime in if you're here…rollcall
[11:02:02] <JasonDScott> Here
[11:02:19] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:02:59] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:04:06] <todd_> hey guys
[11:04:19] <gseguin> hey
[11:04:27] <todd_> johnbender?
[11:04:40] <todd_> agenda here:
[11:04:42] <todd_> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZpho_PVuDWRwnvvWSPuDwtaLtfwNhljD2sn3NUiit4/edit
[11:04:53] <todd_> I'll go first
[11:05:15] <todd_> 1.2 RC1 is about ready to go. Working on a change log and blog post
[11:05:23] <todd_> mauriceG here?
[11:05:54] <todd_> as you can see, we only have one issue on our plate for 1.2
[11:05:55] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=13&state=open
[11:06:08] <todd_> specifically: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4978
[11:06:19] <todd_> word is JasonDScott is looking at it
[11:06:29] <todd_> Blackberry OS 5 broken on loading with JQuery Mobile 1.2.0 Beta 1 in combination with JQuery 1.8 or 1.8.1
[11:06:44] <JasonDScott> Yes I am
[11:06:46] <todd_> this seems to be a 1.8.x issue on BB5 but we need his help to track it down
[11:07:00] <todd_> any leads JasonDScott
[11:07:12] <JasonDScott> Not yet
[11:07:21] <todd_> ok.
[11:07:26] <johnbender> todd_: here
[11:07:45] <todd_> hey johnbender
[11:08:03] <todd_> so the only question in my mind is whether we should hold the RC for the BB5 issue
[11:08:36] <johnbender> urgh
[11:09:15] <johnbender> well it's reasonable to tell people that they should just stick with 1.7.2 if they want to support bb os 5
[11:09:19] <JasonDScott> Can they still 1.7.1?
[11:09:23] <johnbender> the page just breaks
[11:09:29] <johnbender> that's the biggest issue
[11:09:32] <todd_> we're charing our device now
[11:09:43] <todd_> JasonDScott: have you been able to repro
[11:09:44] <johnbender> todd_: hopefully it's something trivial
[11:09:57] <todd_> and do you know if 1.7.x works with latest in BB5?
[11:10:21] <JasonDScott> it is repro
[11:11:30] <todd_> ok
[11:11:37] <todd_> so /test/ leaves you with a blank page
[11:11:47] <todd_> have you tried swapping out 1.8 for 1.7.2
[11:12:21] <todd_> i feel like we can probably note this at RC and try to land a small fix before final if we can
[11:12:26] <JasonDScott> 1.7.2 works
[11:12:36] <todd_> ok, so it is a core change
[11:12:55] <todd_> whatever it is, DaveMethvin wants to know so they can tweak it for 1.8.2
[11:13:15] <JasonDScott> Ok I will let him know
[11:14:00] <todd_> cool
[11:14:08] <uGoMobi> can we do bisect with core?
[11:14:13] <todd_> so this is a priority so if you can keep digging, that would be great
[11:14:28] <todd_> uGoMobi: a good idea…jojohnbender?
[11:15:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you can, but you'll have to build it each time and copy it over
[11:15:16] <uGoMobi> I have BB5 emulator
[11:15:19] <johnbender> well
[11:15:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes
[11:15:33] <johnbender> just do a `grunt watch` from one terminal
[11:15:37] <johnbender> and do the bisect in another
[11:15:42] <uGoMobi> right
[11:15:45] <johnbender> then refrence the jquery ind dist/
[11:15:51] <johnbender> from a jqm page
[11:16:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'd be more interested to see where the error comes from either way
[11:16:10] <johnbender> we can probably work around it
[11:16:18] <johnbender> I'm betting it has something to do with sizzle
[11:16:36] <johnbender> which has been the source of most of our issues with core lately
[11:16:46] <todd_> yep
[11:17:30] <uGoMobi> ok I can set this up after the meeting
[11:17:33] <todd_> sounds like a plan
[11:17:37] <todd_> other than RC prep, I'm working intensely on a new jQuery Mobile project logo, will be finalized within days
[11:17:52] <todd_> i'd like to roll that out for final
[11:18:50] <todd_> who wants to hop in next
[11:19:05] <uGoMobi> i can goo
[11:19:14] <uGoMobi> fixed the grid > slider / listview issues
[11:19:38] <uGoMobi> swipe issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4478  tested on http://goo.gl/irGhT and seems only issue on iPhone/iOS
[11:20:07] <todd_> awesome
[11:20:21] <uGoMobi> I think the event object reports wrong pageX, pageY values
[11:20:35] <todd_> not good
[11:20:41] <uGoMobi> did anyone else test?
[11:20:51] <todd_> so this is going to need more research
[11:20:58] <todd_> i didn't, nope
[11:21:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I think gseguin did and he couldn't reproduce it
[11:21:02] <uGoMobi> MauriceG tested on iPhone and noticed that issue, on ICS and JB no issues
[11:21:24] <uGoMobi> something for 1.2.1
[11:21:31] <todd_> yep
[11:21:38] <todd_> so no rush there
[11:21:38] <uGoMobi> fix for 1px jitter fixed toolbars - PR almost ready
[11:21:40] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4895
[11:21:44] <todd_> great
[11:22:00] <todd_> wasn't there a PR mauriceG was going to work on?
[11:22:08] <uGoMobi> only one small thing... content shifts 1px on tapToggle
[11:22:17] <todd_> he had a test page…oh the popup toolbars
[11:22:31] <todd_> hrm
[11:22:31] <uGoMobi> todd_ : yes, he created a PR
[11:22:36] <todd_> oh, great
[11:22:46] <todd_> did you land that?
[11:23:01] <uGoMobi> no, but I checked it
[11:23:09] <todd_> seem ok?
[11:23:17] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:23:24] <todd_> be worth getting in if we can
[11:23:50] <uGoMobi> small thing about the order of the properties (-webkit should become before unprefixed) but that is detail
[11:23:56] <uGoMobi> can change after pulling
[11:24:02] <todd_> it should, yes
[11:24:03] <todd_> ok
[11:24:08] <todd_> re: jitter, let's look at that after.
[11:24:17] <todd_> after this meeting, that is
[11:24:22] <uGoMobi> worked on docs CSS
[11:24:24] <uGoMobi> did some triage last two days
[11:24:25] <uGoMobi> working on horizontal collapsibles with @frequent
[11:24:27] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4865
[11:24:36] <uGoMobi> that's it
[11:24:46] <todd_> cool, thanks!
[11:24:54] <todd_> mind linking up the issues for grid > slider / listview issues
[11:24:57] <uGoMobi> only thing I would like to discuss some time is triage
[11:24:58] <todd_> in the agenda
[11:25:12] <todd_> for the blog post
[11:25:19] <todd_> and .org update
[11:25:30] <uGoMobi> yes will do
[11:25:45] <todd_> thanks
[11:25:52] <todd_> johnbender: wanna go
[11:26:18] <uGoMobi> ok the links are in the agenda
[11:26:25] <johnbender> sure
[11:26:44] <johnbender> fixed that navigation bug from full page refreshes in phonegap
[11:26:47] <johnbender> "fixed"
[11:26:50] <johnbender> just so everyone knows
[11:27:00] <johnbender> don't use window.history.back anymore in the source :/
[11:27:04] <johnbender> use $.mobile.back
[11:27:05] <johnbender> for now
[11:27:09] <johnbender> we're not exposing that
[11:27:19] <johnbender> because I'll likely change where it lives when I get into refactoring
[11:27:37] <todd_> nice
[11:27:37] <johnbender> I met with some folks from Comcast who are using jqm fro their customer email app
[11:27:50] <todd_> interesting…what did they say?
[11:27:55] <johnbender> they have some list performance issues
[11:28:08] <johnbender> so I asked them to reproduce it and submit it as a bug
[11:28:12] <johnbender> scrolling perf issues
[11:28:23] <todd_> simple linked lists or did they have events like swipe in play?
[11:28:32] <_|Nix|_> Scrolling? Isn't that native?
[11:28:34] <johnbender> I think kin did some work on that but I wanted to get it in as an issue before we start in on that stuff for 1.4
[11:28:41] <johnbender> todd_: not sure
[11:28:46] <todd_> ok
[11:28:47] <johnbender> that's why I wanted them to boil it down
[11:29:03] <johnbender> and I'm continuing my testswarm work :/
[11:29:12] <todd_> yeah, I do want to give that attention since lists are bread and butter
[11:29:19] <todd_> fun
[11:29:40] <johnbender> todd_: I told them I would take a look to see if there was some way they could patch the source themselves for their usecase
[11:29:44] <todd_> i think when we simplify our markup and icons, it will make a decent difference too
[11:29:52] <todd_> good idea
[11:30:38] <johnbender> thats it
[11:32:01] <todd_> cool, thanks
[11:32:06] <todd_> gseguin?
[11:32:11] <gseguin> sure
[11:32:13] <gseguin> No real update here.
[11:32:23] <gseguin> Looked at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3208
[11:32:30] <gseguin> no progress
[11:32:35] <gseguin> no clue either
[11:33:03] <gseguin> and I have to spend more time on Jive stuff this quarter
[11:33:12] <todd_> that one is mysterious
[11:33:23] <todd_> can you repro?
[11:33:30] <gseguin> but Jive and I are still committed to the project
[11:33:43] <gseguin> yeah I had a coworker repro it
[11:33:49] <todd_> deadlines, understood :)
[11:33:52] <todd_> ok
[11:33:55] <todd_> so odd
[11:34:01] <gseguin> I built a PG project
[11:34:32] <gseguin> I'll push it to github
[11:34:45] <gseguin> so we can collaborate on it
[11:34:46] <todd_> might be worth checking to see if it's a problem in a web view but w/o PG
[11:35:01] <todd_> tho does android have a save to home screen like iOS
[11:35:05] <gseguin> true
[11:35:07] <todd_> ok
[11:35:19] <gseguin> no
[11:35:51] <gseguin> that's it for me
[11:36:17] <todd_> great, thanks gseguin
[11:36:52] <todd_> _|Nix|_: want to go?
[11:36:57] <_|Nix|_> Sure ...
[11:37:02] <_|Nix|_> Not much going on here ...
[11:37:29] <_|Nix|_> Went through the docs and did some copy-editing. Moved that data-corners branch forward.
[11:37:40] <todd_> appreciate the docs review
[11:37:41] <_|Nix|_> I'm really eager to start working on post-1.2.0 stuff.
[11:37:49] <_|Nix|_> When are we branching off 1.2-stable?
[11:37:56] <_|Nix|_> After the final release?
[11:37:57] <todd_> we need help documenting all the non-widget scripts so if you want to help with that...
[11:38:08] <todd_> yes, after final I think
[11:38:11] <_|Nix|_> todd_: ... such as?
[11:38:15] <todd_> which should be soon
[11:38:28] <_|Nix|_> I mean, which non-widget scripts?
[11:38:58] <todd_> look in /js/ - all the scripts in the root should be reviewed for docs
[11:39:08] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:39:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you can always make a branch now and get started
[11:39:13] <todd_> agcolom is working on the widget directory
[11:39:19] <johnbender> I've got 2 or 3 waiting to get merged after the release
[11:39:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know ... that's why I rebased one of the branches already.
[11:39:29] <todd_> but we can do a better job explaining all the other scripts
[11:39:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I might rebase the on-the-fly options too, but I'll probably do it by hand, because we don't want all of it.
[11:39:49] <todd_> if no bombshells come in, we can probably go from RC to final
[11:40:34] <johnbender> todd_: awesome
[11:40:43] <_|Nix|_> Then uGoMobi and I noticed that the collapsibles have this weird API where, instead of function calls you trigger signals.
[11:41:39] <_|Nix|_> So, like, instead of $( "#myCollapsible" ).collapsible( "expand" ) it's $( "#myCollapsible" ).trigger( "expand" )
[11:41:46] <_|Nix|_> ... and the default handler does the expand.
[11:42:07] <_|Nix|_> So, the widget listens to its own this.element and does the work when the listener fires.
[11:42:28] <_|Nix|_> That's inconsistent with the rest of the widgets, which do things via methods.
[11:42:40] <_|Nix|_> So, that's another post-1.2.0 thing.
[11:42:42] <todd_> saw that conversation
[11:42:43] <uGoMobi> is improving/cleaning up current widgets something we can work on at the event in october?
[11:42:53] <todd_> making it consistent internal would be good
[11:43:03] <todd_> sure is
[11:43:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah it would be good to deprecate that behavior asap :(
[11:43:09] <todd_> we have 3 days to jam
[11:43:32] <todd_> too bad we couldn't get that in now so we can drop sooner
[11:43:41] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately, I'll be arriving kinda late on the 15th, so I might be a little late to the party.
[11:43:49] <_|Nix|_> But, I'll be there all day 16th and 17th.
[11:44:02] <uGoMobi> great that you are joining _|Nix|_ !
[11:44:16] <todd_> cool, this is going to be very productive
[11:44:20] <_|Nix|_> Lookin' like it, so far.
[11:44:37] <_|Nix|_> ... but I'm only going for the free t-shirt ;)
[11:44:42] <todd_> we need to look for tasks that we can farm out. like "go through all plugins and make these changes"
[11:44:44] <uGoMobi> with new logo!
[11:44:46] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:44:49] <_|Nix|_> Indeed!
[11:45:03] <todd_> yeah. that's why i need to get cracking on the logo
[11:45:06] <todd_> getting close
[11:45:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you see the popup tolerance issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4985
[11:45:16] <todd_> gotta make lots of people happy
[11:45:25] <todd_> thought that was user error?
[11:45:38] <todd_> "I was incorrectly using the popup parameters. Works great!"
[11:46:03] <uGoMobi> oops sorry
[11:46:05] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... that issue is now closed.
[11:46:19] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG nipped it in the bud.
[11:46:40] <_|Nix|_> So, yeah ... that's about it for me.
[11:47:03] <todd_> alright, cool
[11:47:11] <todd_> mauriceG isn't here methinks
[11:47:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom asked me to add two notes to the agenda for her so I did
[11:47:42] <_|Nix|_> Nope ... his nick wouldn't tab-complete.
[11:48:13] <todd_> Docs: wrote dialogs in api style
[11:48:13] <todd_> APi docs: added textinput (still need to add examples)
[11:48:28] <todd_> ^ I'm counting her as here
[11:48:51] <todd_> think that's it
[11:48:59] <todd_> i'll get back to the logo and RC doc changes then
[11:49:06] <todd_> any Q's from the community?
[11:50:24] <TheCommunity> i have a question how are you guys so smart and also so attractive
[11:50:35] <ryanneufeld> Genetics
[11:50:42] <TheCommunity> ?cc
[11:50:42] <b-ot> TheCommunity, CASE CLOASED!
[11:50:53] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:51:02] <_|Nix|_> Humans are SUPERIOR!
[11:52:55] <todd_> It's mostly my handsomeness making everyone else look good
[11:52:59] <todd_> for the record
[11:53:31] <todd_> :)
[11:53:38] <todd_> anything else before we hop off?
[11:56:46] <todd_> alright, thanks all
[11:56:52] <todd_> RC coming soon
