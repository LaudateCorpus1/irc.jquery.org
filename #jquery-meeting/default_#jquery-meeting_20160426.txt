[14:00:53] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting time!
[14:01:01] <sfrisk> arschmitz, kristyjy, geekman-rohit
[14:02:35] <nashvail> Hello people!
[14:04:25] <sfrisk> Hey nashvail!
[14:05:32] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:06:39] <arschmitz> hi
[14:06:51] <kristyjy> hello
[14:07:28] <sfrisk> first up is a typo fix, https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/155/files
[14:07:44] <sfrisk> fixing spelling, and adding in some stuff to utilities that got ignored
[14:08:19] <sfrisk> only issue is Travis failing - possibly from the old version of node
[14:08:56] <sfrisk> since it looks like Travis was running an old version of node in the Travis Check
[14:09:10] <sfrisk> I can go do this locally, check to if it's still failing
[14:09:39] <sfrisk> grunt test has no failures
[14:09:56] <sfrisk> is everyone okay with me pulling this in, or does anyone notice anything that stands out to them?
[14:10:56] <nashvail> If grunt has no failures then it's okay I guess
[14:11:52] <arschmitz> sfrisk: you should just ask to have the pr rebased
[14:12:11] <arschmitz> if the pr was up to date and rebased then it would have current node and build
[14:13:00] <geekman-rohit> Hey everyone
[14:13:18] <geekman-rohit> @nashvail, Congratulations and Welcome
[14:13:37] <nashvail> thanks geekmain-rohit Glad to be a part
[14:13:57] <sfrisk> glad to have you here, nashvail
[14:14:26] <nashvail> ðŸ˜ƒ
[14:15:05] <sfrisk> kristyjy - I assume since we were both at the same event together ALLLLLL of last weekend/last week, no updates on table styling?
[14:15:23] <kristyjy> yeah that is in fact the case
[14:16:12] <kristyjy> I should have a slow weekend. Things have been a bit crazy for me lately because of my job change but that is ending soon :)
[14:16:34] <kristyjy> so I should be able to get some work done this weekend :)
[14:17:07] <sfrisk> for Images: Basic Styling, we had a few things we were talking about under this
[14:17:19] <sfrisk> nashvail, I know youwere working on a dribble collection?
[14:17:42] <nashvail> yes I am. In the mid of finals so will continue on that.
[14:18:00] <sfrisk> well, focus on finals this week :-)
[14:18:10] <nashvail> oh yes I need to
[14:18:59] <sfrisk> also here is the basic image styling pr:
[14:19:00] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/149/commits/1d72f86d626a614efe3aac776524ca6e56654c2f
[14:19:29] <sfrisk> from what I see, it looks like all of my concerns have been addressed
[14:19:34] <sfrisk> can anyone see anything else?
[14:21:15] <nashvail> Since we'll be working on a UI style guide  we might need to modify some of the styles. Other than that it's great to have some initial code for the image styling
[14:22:17] <sfrisk> I think it's a good base, has a lot of the variables we need
[14:22:26] <sfrisk> and adjusting are default variables shouldn't be hard
[14:24:15] <sfrisk> okay, I'll put it on my list of things to pull in
[14:24:47] <sfrisk> I did pull in the grunt watch running all the tasks at the beginning
[14:25:04] <nashvail> yes
[14:25:17] <sfrisk> haven't pulled in the detecting variable changes
[14:25:48] <sfrisk> arschmitz: does https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/146/files look good to you?
[14:26:39] <arschmitz> yeah it should be a lot less commits
[14:26:44] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[14:26:46] <geekman-rohit> that is all
[14:27:03] <geekman-rohit> @nashvail can you squash them for us?
[14:27:23] <arschmitz> most of them basicly get reverted in the end
[14:27:29] <arschmitz> it should be 2 commits
[14:27:34] <arschmitz> one for adding variables
[14:27:45] <arschmitz> and one for the option change
[14:28:02] <nashvail> yes, there are a few extra useless commits, I 'll squash 'em
[14:28:34] <sfrisk> thanks!
[14:29:22] <sfrisk> just let me know when that's good to go by commenting on the issue and tagging me in the comment
[14:30:06] <nashvail> yup sure!
[14:32:30] <sfrisk> I haven't had a chance to review the input styling recently
[14:33:10] <nashvail> nothing much,  but there are some base variables
[14:33:20] <nashvail> we'll need
[14:34:45] <sfrisk> Looks like this was only for text inputs
[14:35:30] <sfrisk> is there any chance you can add styling for the other inputs/textarea listed in https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/6 ?
[14:36:19] <nashvail> Yes, shouldn't Text area be under the whole input ( .. ) parans there?
[14:36:23] <sfrisk> Since part of https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/10 was to apply it to the relevant input elements on that issue
[14:36:54] <sfrisk> text area was kept separate because it's a <textarea> element vs <input>
[14:37:06] <nashvail> Oh right
[14:37:09] <nashvail> silly me
[14:40:32] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy how goes tables?
[14:40:45] <sfrisk> we already did that. she was on vacation with me
[14:40:49] <sfrisk> neither of us touched a computer
[14:45:00] <sfrisk> has anyone put any further thought in how we want to handle sass unit testing?
[14:45:06] <sfrisk> looking at https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/143/files
[14:45:38] <geekman-rohit> atleast I think we should have some more sass in before working on unit testing
[14:49:01] <sfrisk> yeah, I'm still trying to figure out how best to use it
[14:49:45] <sfrisk> so on Typography, pstyles for paragraph and lists:
[14:49:46] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/142/files
[14:50:44] <sfrisk> looks like styling is for just ol/ul, and the nested ol/ul, but not for li ?
[14:50:55] <sfrisk> and then, it's just margin, which feels like a variable to me
[14:53:44] <sfrisk> okay, last thing is getting accessibility testing merged into master
[14:54:24] <sfrisk> which I think arschmitz was on
[14:56:08] <sfrisk> and that was the last thing on my list of topics
[14:56:22] <sfrisk> anyone have anything else?
[14:57:42] <sfrisk> okay then, that wraps things up for today
[14:57:50] <sfrisk> see everyone in #css-chassis
