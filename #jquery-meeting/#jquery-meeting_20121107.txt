[09:02:32] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Fate is working against me here since I wanted to code some last week but then hurricane and I have a meeting now at work. Just wanted to update you it's on my schedule to do UI2 work tonight or tomorrow afternoon
[09:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer rxaviers gnarf kborchers mikesherov Dave_Stein
[09:02:37] * rxaviers here
[09:02:44] <gnarf> hey!
[09:02:46] <Dave_Stein> i had that ready :)
[09:03:35] <kborchers> hi
[09:04:02] <Dave_Stein> it's our monthly meeting that is on random days of the week but i'm gonna put this meeting on my calendar repeating so hopefully it won't happen again
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: No problem, I merged master into interactions.
[09:04:21] <Dave_Stein> i'll be back later to see what happened... ping me later if you need me
[09:04:25] <Dave_Stein> cool
[09:04:40] <Dave_Stein> my first plan is just to make sure things still work that i made work long ago and then to start on sortable, like i said last meeting but god damn you Sandy
[09:04:43] <Dave_Stein> see you guys later
[09:04:48] <Dave_Stein> everyone is taking the good food
[09:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> Hey petro
[09:06:02] <petro> hey guys
[09:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> Any idea if mikesherov is joining?
[09:06:10] <petro> checking
[09:07:16] <petro> yeah he'll be in a couple minutes
[09:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:07:43] <petro> has work started on the clip rewrite? i'd love to help out
[09:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, would be awesome if you wanted to tackle that.
[09:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> I figure we can land them as they're done, even if that means only some are convereted for 1.10.
[09:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's not like there's any API changes.
[09:09:17] <petro> yep, makes sense
[09:09:31] <mikesherov> hi
[09:09:41] <mikesherov> sorry guys
[09:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> Hey mikesherov
[09:10:06] <petro> what's the timeline for refactoring all of them? just to get an idea of the complexity/scope
[09:10:41] <kborchers> petro: if you could finish by monday that would be great :P
[09:10:46] <mikesherov> LOl
[09:11:07] <petro> that long? so much for "agile"
[09:11:10] <petro> haha
[09:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> petro: I have no idea. I assume each effect will require a different amount of time.
[09:11:14] <kborchers> :D
[09:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> If we could get them all done for 1.10, that'd be awesome.
[09:11:29] <gnarf> petro: as many as we can land?  The big part of it will be writing the clip cssHooks
[09:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10 is planned for December/January.
[09:11:55] <gnarf> once the cssHooks are written, the effects can be ported over pretty quickly I would think
[09:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> But whatever gets done will go into 1.10.
[09:12:22] <petro> sounds like a plan
[09:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> I expect some to still be tricky, like explode.
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> But a lot of effect should be able to just clip the original element, which will be really helpful in fixing bugs.
[09:13:02] <gnarf> yeah, removing the wrappers where we can is a big issue
[09:13:20] <gnarf> as there are a few issues related to wrapping/unwrapping elements with animation (like keeping track of focus)
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, and styles based on child selectors, etc.
[09:14:20] <mikesherov> gnarf: are you writing the clip cssHook?
[09:14:27] <mikesherov> should that be moved to core?
[09:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I guess it depends on size? I thought core didn't really want to add too many hooks.
[09:16:54] <gnarf> mikesherov: i figured it would be a plugin co-opted inside UI effects core - just like color & easing
[09:17:00] <mikesherov> yeah, in general we don't… it really depends if it would use the closed over functions in css.js or not
[09:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> Another thing to consider is adding it to core doesn't help UI :-P
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> We wouldn't be able to use it for another year or two.
[09:17:52] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: true
[09:18:27] <gnarf> I could start something up for it, but petro might have more time than me to work on it :)
[09:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> That alone doesn't mean it shouldn't be added to core, UI certainly implements stuff before core all the time.
[09:19:00] <mikesherov> petro, I can walk you through the cssHooks functionality.
[09:19:15] <mikesherov> sounds like it just needs an expand function, right gnarf?
[09:19:43] <gnarf> mikesherov: clip has a super strange format
[09:19:48] <gnarf> expand doesn't help much
[09:20:07] <mikesherov> k, so just a completely paved over implementation
[09:20:15] <gnarf> clip: rect(top, right, bottom, left)
[09:20:25] <gnarf> and IE <8 doesn't support commas
[09:20:30] <gnarf> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/clip
[09:20:31] <mikesherov> fun
[09:21:13] <gnarf> right and bottom are mesured from left/top
[09:21:28] <gnarf> which is another funky part of that too
[09:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's finish this discussion in -dev.
[09:21:37] <mikesherov> GREAT
[09:21:40] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:22:10] <mikesherov> so, I had a few things to discuss… is Dave_Stein still here?
[09:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein had another meeting.
[09:22:29] <mikesherov> k
[09:22:37] <mikesherov> He left early, I show up late :-\
[09:22:59] <mikesherov> Basically, I just wanted to coordinate the interactions rewrite stuff
[09:23:30] <mikesherov> now that we have tests, and a proper bugs list, and a proposed API, I wanted to know what the next steps were to get this all moving forward together
[09:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Can you join #jqueryui-dev when you get back?
[09:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov, gnarf: Do you have an update for mergeatron?
[09:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Let's talk about next steps for interactions after this meeting in -dev, or maybe tomorrow when jzaefferer is around.
[09:25:25] <mikesherov> k, so I was originally going to get it set by the middle of this week, but Sandy kind of screwed that up
[09:26:12] <mikesherov> Still on my priority list: 1. finish triage "new" bugs 2. mergeatron 3. jQuery 1.9 core stuff 4. testswarm IFRAME stuff
[09:26:25] <mikesherov> so, I imagine possibly this weekend.
[09:27:34] <mikesherov> depends on how much time I have to spend hotel hopping, considering I still don't have power at home
[09:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> Great, I should hopefully have time this week to work on the CLA verification script.
[09:27:56] <mikesherov> awesome
[09:28:23] <tj_vantoll> 36 "new" triage tickets left.  We should be through those in another day or two.
[09:28:35] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: :-)
[09:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's 39 actually
[09:29:04] <tj_vantoll> Update :)
[09:29:15] <mikesherov> HA
[09:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, 36 :-P
[09:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> Trac is so weird with refershing.
[09:29:24] <mikesherov> One "feature", 35 "bugs"
[09:29:27] <tj_vantoll> Yeah it makes no sense.
[09:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> Today is the 24th straight day that our ticket count has gone done.
[09:30:43] <kborchers> you guys rock! i'm going to have to update some slides before my talk next week because these numbers are crazy :)
[09:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> Down to 513 total tickets.
[09:31:01] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: It will be that way every day until these 36 are gone
[09:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> 64 pending closure.
[09:31:38] <mikesherov> Awesome
[09:31:41] <tj_vantoll> Resizable and Sortable are still a bit of a mess.  A good pass through for duplicates on those two can probably kill off quite a few more.
[09:31:48] <mikesherov> the next steps is retriaging the existing tickets after this, and doing more reduction to see what's going on
[09:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like 9 will close today.
[09:32:00] <mikesherov> we'll probably find another 20 dupes that way
[09:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, next item.
[09:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to do 1.9.2 in a month or so.
[09:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be cherry-picking all the bug fixes from master into 1-9-stable soon.
[09:33:35] <mikesherov> cool
[09:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> On a related note, we need to get 1-9-stable running in TestSwarm.
[09:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what's required for that to happen.
[09:34:23] <mikesherov> I have no clue
[09:34:44] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: Let me know when you're around.
[09:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of swarm, we're green again :-)
[09:35:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its actually pretty easy to do
[09:35:17] <gnarf> just clone the one that checks master and change its branch/name :)
[09:35:18] <mikesherov> yeah, except testswarm needs an upgrade
[09:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> Though we have new failures against core 1.6.x and 1.7.x :-/
[09:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> I need to figure out what happened there.
[09:36:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, I think we actually have 5 "projects" to clone.
[09:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll start with one and see if it works.
[09:38:23] <mikesherov> k
[09:38:45] <scott_gonzalez> I did a review of all the old docs on MediaWiki.
[09:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> There's not too much content that hasn't been migrated: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/24
[09:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> I can work on the upgrade guides. The old ones are probably pretty bad.
[09:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> The rest is going in to the learn site.
[09:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> I should probably copy the content into a gist or something so that we can blow away the content if we want.
[09:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> Would be great to finally get rid of docs.jquery so people stop looking at it.
[09:40:33] <mikesherov> .
[09:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> We also need to move to the new-css branch in web-base-template, but I'll discuss that with jzaefferer when he's around.
[09:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> Since we need to coordinate the move with qunitjs.com.
[09:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Any news on getting notifications for wiki changes?
[09:42:28] <gnarf> nope - I'm pretty sure it's possible though - I'll work on it next week after I get home
[09:42:34] <gnarf> no time left before the asia trip
[09:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> Not super urgent, but would be nice to move away from pbworks by the end of the year.
[09:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: updates on download builder/TR?
[09:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> The big item that needs to land for 1.10 is support of multiple versions.
[09:44:18] <rxaviers> well, I've been going thru the github issue list since Im back (mon)
[09:44:29] <rxaviers> fixing/closing some issues
[09:44:39] <rxaviers> not many things
[09:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> Got an estimate (in weeks is good enough) on how long multiple version support will take?
[09:45:31] <rxaviers> will do it and let you know by the eod
[09:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You wanted to discuss CSS transforms + interactions?
[09:46:20] <mikesherov> yeah, I mean, basically… it's a can of worms
[09:46:36] <mikesherov> I think we need to take a stand to either support, or not support it
[09:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a systemic problem with this in core?
[09:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> Or is it just interactions written poorly?
[09:47:04] <mikesherov> it's a general problem
[09:47:08] <mikesherov> what is .width()?
[09:47:17] <mikesherov> is it width * scale?
[09:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't used transforms at all, so I'm clueless.
[09:47:20] <tj_vantoll> 3D collision detection o_O
[09:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so if you have an element with width: 100px; scale: 2; is .offsetWidth still 100?
[09:48:23] <mikesherov> so, you can say "width:100px; transform: scale(2,4);"
[09:48:35] <mikesherov> offsetWidth is fine
[09:48:44] <mikesherov> just visually, it's different
[09:48:50] <mikesherov> transforms don't effect box model
[09:48:58] <mikesherov> but some people expect it to work
[09:49:21] <mikesherov> you can translate as well, which doesn't affect top/left, but visually, it affects it
[09:50:20] <petro> supporting transforms in that way would be a slippery slope
[09:51:05] <tj_vantoll> The interactions currently support a lot of options that don't even really make sense with a lot of transforms.
[09:51:10] <petro> by that, i mean that having .width() taking CSS transforms into account opens a can of worms
[09:51:33] <petro> then, what about css filters and shaders?
[09:51:34] <mikesherov> exactly right
[09:51:56] <mikesherov> What I'm saying simply is that css effects, we should say as a policy: wonftix
[09:51:59] <mikesherov> wontfix
[09:52:22] <petro> but what about scale factor? eg. for hires screens
[09:52:44] <mikesherov> petro? what do you mean?
[09:53:11] <petro> oh nvm i misread your earlier comment
[09:53:42] <petro> i thought your scale: 2 was referring to the webkit scale property for retina displays…carry on
[09:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, yeah, this seems crazy.
[09:54:47] <mikesherov> so, that's all I wanted to say, scott_gonzalez, was that we just take a firm stance on wontfix for transforms
[09:54:52] <tj_vantoll> +1 for blanket wontfix on CSS transforms
[09:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, seems good.
[09:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to close that ticket?
[09:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> And #8618 as well.
[09:55:45] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we should put this on the wontfix page too.
[09:56:10] <mikesherov> right
[09:56:12] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8618 wontfi
[09:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> classic: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6844#comment:13
[09:57:05] <tj_vantoll> WHY HAVE NOT FIXED
[09:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Did you wnat to discuss progressbar at all?
[09:57:59] <tj_vantoll> There's a wontfix page?
[09:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix
[09:58:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: probably not necessary after the discussion in -dev this morning. just going to get rid of _value() and refactor in master then merge that into the progressbar branch and try to get the PR merged
[09:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:59:15] <kborchers> hope to get that done tonight
[09:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to everyone's favorite tool: SVN
[09:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui/source/browse/
[09:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> We haven't used SVN for a few years, other than adding tags from GitHub (WTF?)
[10:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> But somehow people keep coming across this and every once in a while we'll get a bug report or a patch based on it.
[10:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> I want to delete everything from trunk and delete all the branches.
[10:00:51] <mikesherov> great
[10:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> The repo and history will remain, but it will be completely empty.
[10:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> That way people won't have any reason to think it's active.
[10:01:09] <kborchers> +1
[10:01:22] <mikesherov> +1
[10:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like everyone's on board, so I'll do that today.
[10:01:44] <kborchers> mikesherov + kborchers = everyone \o/
[10:01:52] <mikesherov> lol
[10:01:58] <gnarf> SVN needs to DIAF
[10:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> confirm
[10:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything on the agenda.
[10:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
[10:03:36] <mikesherov> thanks!
[11:02:34] <gnarf> Hey!
[11:02:42] <clarkbox> hello
[11:03:08] <ryanneufeld> ping
[11:03:13] <gnarf> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUfGj8dQH3Q4JoBOlNnfDFrESzMt6LhktXsmtPYocXI/edit
[11:03:28] <gnarf> so hey clark
[11:03:33] <gnarf> splunk machine is up again
[11:03:43] <gnarf> but i'm having an issue setting up the extra drive
[11:03:48] <clarkbox> ok
[11:03:54] <clarkbox> is it on the same IP/host?
[11:03:57] <gnarf> yeah
[11:04:02] <clarkbox> cool thanks
[11:04:05] <gnarf> new ssh key tho
[11:04:13] <gnarf> ssh's is gonna complain
[11:04:20] <clarkbox> k
[11:04:30] <gnarf> should get the drive figured out in a few days
[11:04:36] <clarkbox> sure no rush
[11:05:37] <gnarf> Anyone got any comments/questions about https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues?state=open
[11:06:29] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/74
[11:06:42] <johnbender> where did that land
[11:06:52] <johnbender> I haven't taken any action on it
[11:07:53] <gnarf> nor I - I think I'm going to handle this when I get the new script/repo for code.jquery.com setup
[11:08:45] <gnarf> I can prolly do a little more investigation after the meeting and discuss
[11:08:58] <gnarf> also johnbender - we have #jquery-infrastructure now too
[11:09:18] <johnbender> yah
[11:09:29] <johnbender> I thought I added that to my autojoin list
[11:09:31] * johnbender goes to check
[11:10:06] <gnarf> johnbender: I'm really only concerned that the cron dies
[11:10:11] <johnbender> yah
[11:10:12] <gnarf> and i think it was already dead
[11:10:13] <gnarf> but
[11:10:15] <gnarf> i'll make sure
[11:10:17] <johnbender> cool
[11:10:26] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/115 ?
[11:11:50] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/76
[11:12:05] <gnarf> ajpiano: you here?
[11:12:29] <gnarf> sigh - feedburner - I need to dig through the logs and see if I can figure out what URL it's trying to receive
[11:13:25] <gnarf> so commented
[11:13:46] <gnarf> i'll try to tackle that today
[11:14:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: can you think of anything to add on #115 ?
[11:14:39] <gnarf> I'm just curious where we should host such a document --- jquery.github.com ?
[11:14:41] <gnarf> ajpiano: ?
[11:15:05] <ajpiano> what document
[11:15:08] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I don't think so. other than a link to the ZNC docs
[11:15:36] <gnarf> ajpiano: like a little "welcome to using ZNC - here's some tips for how things are setup"
[11:16:07] <gnarf> also, I kinda wanna send out a second invitation to use our ZNC
[11:16:20] <gnarf> there are probably other team members interested that haven't spoken up
[11:17:01] <jzaefferer> gnarf clarkbox: splunk access pls, for rxaviers as well
[11:17:15] <clarkbox> yes
[11:17:33] <gnarf> clarkbox: can you create those two accounts?
[11:17:35] <clarkbox> i need to recover that box… it crashed since the conference
[11:17:37] <clarkbox> yes
[11:17:41] <gnarf> cool
[11:17:51] <clarkbox> ill have splunk running in full effect by this time next week
[11:18:06] <gnarf> also, next week - I'll be on a plane
[11:18:15] <gnarf> so, meet without me ;)
[11:18:46] <gnarf> ajpiano: any thoughts about where that sort of document goes? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/115
[11:18:57] <ajpiano> gnarf: sorry gnarf, i'm on the phone
[11:19:00] <jzaefferer> jquery.github.com seems fine for that
[11:19:03] <ajpiano> jquery.github.com seems fine
[11:19:11] <jzaefferer> haha
[11:19:16] <gnarf> agree
[11:19:18] <ryanneufeld> JYNX
[11:19:19] <jzaefferer> NO U
[11:20:23] <jzaefferer> for puppet docs, infrastructure wiki seems good. Is there anything new yet/
[11:20:24] <jzaefferer> ?
[11:21:47] <gnarf> RE: puppet docs? not really
[11:22:13] <gnarf> mergeatron is stalled out due to Sandy & mikesherov's time
[11:22:18] <gnarf> I'm excited to work with it tho :)
[11:22:48] <ryanneufeld> what is it?
[11:23:16] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: mergeatron listens to the github API for pull request commits and automatically tests them
[11:23:25] <ryanneufeld> nice
[11:23:26] <gnarf> submits status back using the status API
[11:23:49] <gnarf> big issue ATM is it's mongo dep
[11:23:59] <gnarf> but mikesherov was replacing it with a sqllite dep
[11:24:03] <ryanneufeld> oic
[11:24:08] <ryanneufeld> we don't like mongo?
[11:24:16] <johnbender> mongo :(
[11:24:19] <gnarf> i love mongo
[11:24:32] <gnarf> i hate (mt)'s bad memory management
[11:24:38] <ryanneufeld> right
[11:24:45] <ryanneufeld> have you complained to them about that?
[11:24:47] <gnarf> i think mongo + (mt) memory = disaster in a can
[11:24:52] <gnarf> constantly
[11:25:01] <ryanneufeld> seems like something that shouldn't be an issue
[11:25:04] <gnarf> the helix platform will help us with this
[11:25:43] <ryanneufeld> when you get back from asia, we gonna go over that too?
[11:25:47] <gnarf> the way (mt) does their Virtual machines means we don't get any swap
[11:26:08] <ryanneufeld> swapfiles?
[11:26:19] <ryanneufeld> swap doesn't have to be a partition
[11:26:22] <ryanneufeld> we can use a swapfile
[11:26:40] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: newp
[11:26:42] <johnbender> well
[11:26:44] <johnbender> not last time I checked
[11:26:48] <ryanneufeld> wat?
[11:26:48] <b-ot> The CSS goes ok, but the jQuery doesn't with the PHP $strings.
[11:27:00] <johnbender> I wanted a swap file for the old jenkins
[11:27:04] <johnbender> because it was going oom
[11:27:08] <johnbender> OOM
[11:27:10] <johnbender> as in
[11:27:13] <johnbender> there was no swap
[11:27:15] <ryanneufeld> ?boom
[11:27:15] <johnbender> at all
[11:27:15] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[11:27:31] <johnbender> it has to do with their pricing model and memory
[11:27:31] <ryanneufeld> oh, you mean Out Of Memory
[11:27:34] <johnbender> yes
[11:27:39] <ryanneufeld> derp
[11:27:39] <johnbender> sorry
[11:27:44] * johnbender is a nerd
[11:27:45] <gnarf> swap is actually not allowed
[11:27:48] <ryanneufeld> so'k
[11:27:52] <gnarf> even in swapfile
[11:27:53] <johnbender> :( :(
[11:28:03] <ryanneufeld> that's really uncool
[11:28:04] <gnarf> because imagine 100 machines all hitting the same disk for swap
[11:28:14] <ryanneufeld> oh, shared hosting
[11:28:17] <johnbender> right
[11:28:20] <ryanneufeld> eff
[11:28:26] <johnbender> we talked with our contact there and that's what he told us
[11:28:38] <gnarf> helix we have SSD and full control
[11:28:38] <gnarf> so
[11:28:49] <ryanneufeld> we can do what we please?
[11:29:16] <gnarf> pretty much
[11:29:18] <gnarf> :)
[11:29:30] <gnarf> of course
[11:29:40] <gnarf> its also been a pain (see the issues with splunk)
[11:29:50] <gnarf> but i think its just cuz we are like on the "beta" platform atm
[11:31:58] <gnarf> Package Upgrades - ryanneufeld did you get any done?
[11:32:25] <gnarf> want to try like citadel + staging servers today
[11:32:32] <gnarf> and upgrade live tomorrow?
[11:34:36] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I did not
[11:34:45] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I was going through the cron emails
[11:34:48] <gnarf> k
[11:35:06] <ryanneufeld> and access became an issue, danheberden sorted me out, but by then the weekend was over for me, and real life wanted my attention
[11:35:09] <gnarf> we do need to push this out soon, but if not today/tomorrow lets wait until I'm back
[11:35:30] <gnarf> we should prolly do it over two days anyway, give stage time to blow up
[11:35:37] <gnarf> not that it should
[11:35:43] <gnarf> but package upgrades are always scary
[11:35:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:35:59] <ryanneufeld> you can upgrade specific ones pretty easily
[11:36:09] <gnarf> true, but I'd rather get em all
[11:36:20] <gnarf> the closer we stay to edge, the better off we are
[11:36:35] <ryanneufeld> we're on debian stable right?
[11:36:47] <gnarf> yup
[11:36:49] <ryanneufeld> I trust that pretty well.
[11:36:53] <gnarf> exactly
[11:36:59] <ryanneufeld> seems most of our issues are related to shitty memory management
[11:39:03] <gnarf> any other business for infra to chat about today?
[11:39:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: punt the upgrades to next week ?
[11:39:25] <gnarf> or do em today?
[11:39:39] <ryanneufeld> I'm not gonna have time this week
[11:39:41] <gnarf> k
[11:39:42] <ryanneufeld> punt em
[11:39:53] <ryanneufeld> the next couple weeks are super busy for me
[11:40:07] <ryanneufeld> rebuilding a mobile site from scratch
[11:40:13] <gnarf> eww
[11:40:21] <ryanneufeld> meh, I wanted to doit
[11:40:30] <ryanneufeld> all the views are done already
[11:40:34] <ryanneufeld> and most of the js
[11:40:37] <ryanneufeld> it's just the php
[11:40:39] <ryanneufeld> any hwo
[11:40:56] <ryanneufeld> I'm around while you're gone if people need help
[11:41:01] <ryanneufeld> but I'm mostly away
[11:41:09] <gnarf> coo - gonna shut this down - see ya in -infra*
