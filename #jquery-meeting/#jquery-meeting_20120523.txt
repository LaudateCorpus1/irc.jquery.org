[09:00:08] <rworth> hey
[09:00:24] <kborchers> hi
[09:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> ehy
[09:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> hey, even
[09:02:03] <rworth> ehy
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> So, I'll go ahead and admit that I didn't realize it was Wednesday until half an hour ago...
[09:02:50] <kborchers> :)
[09:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> Give me a minute to update the agenda.
[09:03:51] <jzaefferer> ehy hey
[09:04:08] <rworth> hey ehy jzaefferer
[09:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I think we might be good now.
[09:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: docs update
[09:04:50] <rworth> got resources (images) working on api.jquery.com
[09:04:58] <rworth> that might do it for that site, other than design
[09:05:13] <rworth> of course there are schema changes to be normalized between it and api.jqueryui.com
[09:05:25] <jzaefferer> so api.jquery.com is now based on xml files in a git repo, deployed via node/grunt-wordpress?
[09:05:27] <rworth> and I have to work out a system of sharing a single xslt
[09:05:37] <rworth> well stage.api.jquery.com
[09:05:42] <rworth> but yes
[09:05:47] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:05:55] <rworth> I meant the api.jquery.com repo :)
[09:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> That's good progress :-)
[09:06:41] <kswedberg1> rock on rworth and scott_gonzalez! you guys have been the awesome with progress on the api sites
[09:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> So you should be able to move on to api.jqueryui.com by next week?
[09:06:50] <rworth> so I'll be iterating a lot over the ui docs in the next week
[09:06:53] <rworth> yup
[09:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:07:07] <rworth> scott_gonzalez has been the awesome
[09:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer noticed some issues yesterday for UI docs.
[09:07:34] <rworth> saw one issue he created
[09:07:37] <rworth> was there another?
[09:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> It may have just been one.
[09:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> Return values for widget methods?
[09:08:35] <jzaefferer> I've put something on the wiki page, didn't think of creating an issue on GitHub
[09:08:48] <rworth> oh, is that what I saw?
[09:08:59] <jzaefferer> prolly
[09:09:05] <jzaefferer> "Fix method signatures. Widget has signature elements, but xslt doesn't process them"
[09:09:49] <rworth> ok, I'll take a look. Widget needs to be reworked anyway, caus the current version is based on use doing xml inheritance
[09:09:59] <rworth> but we abandoned that last week after scott_gonzalez and I chatted a bit
[09:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> rworth and I should stop chatting. It seems like every time we do, we create more work :-P
[09:10:33] <rworth> :)
[09:10:37] <gnarf> :)
[09:10:46] <rworth> ehy gnarf
[09:11:02] <gnarf> hey!
[09:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> Look what I've done with my inability to type...
[09:11:18] <rworth> FLASHCAGE
[09:11:21] <jzaefferer> Btw. just added a link to the Roadmap to the wiki frontpage
[09:11:37] <jzaefferer> Go figure why no one ever finds that...
[09:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:12:10] <rworth> thanks jzaefferer
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on ARIA updates for tabs.
[09:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> Not much to report there.
[09:13:19] <jzaefferer> Menu is getting closer, as kborchers improved test coverage. Still waiting for Hans to report back from his ARIA testing.
[09:14:10] <jzaefferer> In my own tests, it worked perfect in NVDA, and good in JAWS, though JAWS didn't announce the number of menu items, makes navigation a lot less intuitive
[09:14:43] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i only tested in NVDA and it seemed great
[09:14:48] <jzaefferer> rworth let me know when you start with UI docs, I want to be involved there
[09:14:54] <rworth> ok
[09:14:58] <jzaefferer> seems like there's still a lot to do
[09:15:12] <jzaefferer> at this point there are too many open questions for me to work on anything really
[09:15:26] <jzaefferer> like abandoning inheritance is good to know...
[09:16:04] <jzaefferer> menu is a good candidate to finish docs for, it already covers a lot
[09:16:49] <jzaefferer> btw scott_gonzalez we should contact whoever maintains moment.js, maybe via Alex, see what they think of Globalize and CLDR
[09:17:27] <jzaefferer> it looks like they maintain their own culture infos...
[09:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:17:45] <jzaefferer> maybe even more interesting for rworth, as you'v been involved a lot more in Globalize
[09:18:56] <rworth> https://github.com/timrwood/
[09:19:01] <jzaefferer> somewhat similar to datejs, momentjs also has this DSL for creating dates, at least that part is different from Globalize
[09:19:17] <rworth> https://github.com/timrwood/moment/tree/master/lang
[09:19:20] <jzaefferer> I don't really get why people care about that :/
[09:19:45] <jzaefferer> rworth: yeah, that looks rather custom handmade to me
[09:19:52] <rworth> yeah
[09:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> Moving on to release...
[09:21:55] <jzaefferer> meh, no email address on github, no contact information on his site
[09:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9m8 went out last week.
[09:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> We may push 1.9 into July, so that we can focus on site launches.
[09:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> Since many of use are working on both.
[09:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> If we can get everything done in time for the conf, great. But the sites are higher priority right now.
[09:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> Also, core may not get 1.8 out in time for the conf, and we should wait for 1.8 final so we can ship it with 1.9.
[09:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> In the meantime, we'll continue doing 1.8.x releases every month.
[09:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> Also, if we can figure out theming, I'm on board with landing progressbar API changes in 1.9.
[09:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers has an open PR for indeterminate progressbars.
[09:26:11] <jzaefferer> What has to be figured out there?
[09:26:21] <kborchers> jzaefferer: theming the gif
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> We can't create animated images in TR.
[09:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> And the styling we want is animated striped bars.
[09:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged scottjehl about it, hopefully he'll have ideas.
[09:27:30] <kborchers> i did it with CSS animation (so unsupported browsers would just have a static striped bar). if that's acceptable, then we just need to colorize that gif
[09:27:56] <gnarf> seems acceptable to me
[09:28:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, me too. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/619#issuecomment-4814007
[09:28:42] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (1m, 3w ago): Progressbar: Add ability to set value: false for an indeterminate progressbar. Fixes #7624 - Progressbar: Support value: false for indeterminate progressbar
[09:29:13] <rworth> let's do it
[09:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:32:50] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:32:58] <jzaefferer> I'll post an issue on the Moment repo
[09:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:33:07] <jzaefferer> Seems like the best way to get in touch with them
