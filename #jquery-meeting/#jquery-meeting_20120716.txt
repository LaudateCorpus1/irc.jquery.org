[09:04:57] <DaveMethvin> at least some people are reporting ubs
[09:05:00] <DaveMethvin> bugs*
[09:05:09] <mikesherov> here
[09:05:13] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[09:05:16] <mikesherov> Hello
[09:05:20] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[09:05:27] <DaveMethvin> now the party can start!
[09:05:31] <jaubourg> hi mike, rick
[09:05:34] <DaveMethvin> should be a short meeting
[09:05:48] <rwaldron> hey DaveMethvin mikesherov jaubourg gibson042 gnarf
[09:05:57] <mikesherov> hi
[09:05:59] <DaveMethvin> so what does everyone think of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12087
[09:06:05] <DaveMethvin> seems like a bug to me
[09:06:13] <DaveMethvin> it's quoted
[09:06:19] <DaveMethvin> the comma shouldn't be heeded
[09:06:23] <mikesherov> EXPANDO CONTAINING A COMA
[09:06:30] <mikesherov> maybe the dev is in a coma
[09:06:34] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:06:44] * jaubourg fails into a coma
[09:06:59] <DaveMethvin> i fell into a coma during my blue period
[09:07:05] <rwaldron> pfft
[09:07:10] <rwaldron> yeah, that's definitely a bug
[09:07:11] <gibson042> latest Sizzle fixes it
[09:07:13] <jaubourg> Dave: your best painting period ever
[09:07:16] <rwaldron> gibson042 ftw
[09:07:25] <gibson042> http://jsfiddle.net/zbDvU/2/
[09:07:28] <DaveMethvin> i wondered about that gibson042
[09:07:30] <mikesherov> addy closed this bug as wfm though 105 minutes ago
[09:07:38] <mikesherov> reopen and resolve as fixed
[09:07:38] <DaveMethvin> well we can unworksforme
[09:07:41] <DaveMethvin> ::D
[09:07:50] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:08:08] <DaveMethvin> ok i wondered whether the regex tweaking gibson042 did might fix it, so yay for that
[09:08:13] <gibson042> oh, hang on
[09:08:21] <gibson042> seems like I spoke too soon
[09:08:30] <gibson042> :\
[09:09:36] <gibson042> at any rate, it *should* work without escaping
[09:09:41] <DaveMethvin> oh well, i suspect it can be fixed, mainly i was thinkin it was a bug
[09:09:43] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:09:59] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 can you look at it?
[09:10:04] <gibson042> yeah
[09:10:45] <DaveMethvin> i'll wait before landing the other sizzle pulls then, just in case they're affected
[09:10:56] <DaveMethvin> didn't look to see if they might be
[09:11:36] <DaveMethvin> ok on ajax you may have noticed i closed $.sjax, after looking at it i agree with jaubourg that it's just duplicated code
[09:11:45] <gibson042> actually, I'd prefer to work off of those than try to deal with merge conflict resolution
[09:12:01] <DaveMethvin> oh you want me to land them then?
[09:12:10] <DaveMethvin> i can do that after the meeting
[09:12:32] <gibson042> as long as there are no objections
[09:12:52] <DaveMethvin> i'll take a closer look after the mtg and land unless i have questions
[09:13:01] <DaveMethvin> so jaubourg is there anything else you think should be  split from ajax?
[09:13:10] <jaubourg> not sure
[09:13:21] <jaubourg> I hate the fact I have the ajaxSettings reference in serialize.js though
[09:13:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[09:13:42] <jaubourg> just did a 100% behaviour compatible split here
[09:13:47] <jaubourg> prob something we should look at
[09:13:51] <jaubourg> for 1.9/2.0
[09:13:52] <DaveMethvin> could it be passed in as a parameter?
[09:14:16] <DaveMethvin> if we deprecated ajax.settings.traditional i guess it would help
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea whose code that might break
[09:14:28] <jaubourg> interesting idea, but it would break for people that rely on it outside ajax
[09:14:35] <jaubourg> neither do I
[09:14:48] <jaubourg> I'd expect people to go through ajax anyway for this
[09:14:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think we have to keep it, i know *I* had code that needed .traditional
[09:15:14] <jaubourg> we should deprecate it though, that way, we remove in 1.9/2.0
[09:15:23] <jaubourg> and only rely on the argument
[09:15:33] <jaubourg> afaik, the arg is passed in the ajax code anyway
[09:15:45] <jaubourg> not sure why we had this setting looked at in the function
[09:16:09] <DaveMethvin> let me write this out in a sentence: :D
[09:16:14] <jaubourg> haha
[09:16:48] <DaveMethvin> in 1.8, the direct use of ajaxSettings.traditional by .serialize() is deprecated
[09:16:59] <DaveMethvin> $.ajax will still honor it
[09:17:12] <DaveMethvin> and also in 1.8 (?) you can pass it in as an argument
[09:17:13] <jaubourg> seems sensible
[09:17:20] <DaveMethvin> so that would be the change
[09:17:29] <jaubourg> good point, I'll look into it
[09:17:45] <jaubourg> not right now because I have to fly, but before we release 1.8
[09:17:50] <jaubourg> when is the release btw?
[09:17:57] <DaveMethvin> next week?
[09:18:03] <DaveMethvin> depends on UI's release
[09:18:09] <jaubourg> ok, so i'll look into it soon then :P
[09:18:13] <DaveMethvin> we need to get them out together so we don't break it
[09:18:16] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks jaubourg
[09:18:26] <DaveMethvin> let me type this into the notes
[09:18:43] <jaubourg> as for parseJSON and parseXML, they have usages outside of ajax that are not really akin to serialize
[09:18:50] <jaubourg> hence why I let them in core for now
[09:18:56] <jaubourg> not sure if we should separate them
[09:19:53] <DaveMethvin> might be useful
[09:20:04] <DaveMethvin> if someone wants to use an alternate ajax
[09:20:14] <jaubourg> yeah, but they're in core right now so...
[09:20:15] <DaveMethvin> perhaps a parse.js module?
[09:20:24] <jaubourg> perhaps, but we would have to put parseHTML
[09:20:28] <jaubourg> and it doesn't make sense to me
[09:20:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah,  you're right
[09:20:40] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking they were in ajax
[09:20:56] <DaveMethvin> okay, no change there
[09:21:20] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: #12087 is independent of the Sizzle pulls, so no need to advance/retard their inclusion
[09:21:33] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[09:22:26] <DaveMethvin> not really sure when rc1 will come out next week, probably weds or later
[09:22:54] <DaveMethvin> anything else on anyone's radar? things we need to fix before we ship 1.8?
[09:23:33] <jaubourg> I need to look into progress handler context (it defaults to the Deferred and is kinda of a breach in isolation)
[09:23:53] <jaubourg> problem is I'm not sure how to properly address the issue
[09:23:54] <DaveMethvin> ok, is there a ticket?
[09:24:02] <jaubourg> yep but I can't remember where
[09:24:24] <DaveMethvin> hmm, yeah that sounds bad although more in theory than practice i suspect
[09:24:30] <jaubourg> it's this kind of hot potatoe ticket... there is not good solution
[09:24:43] <DaveMethvin> solution: DON"T DO THAT!
[09:24:45] <jaubourg> problem is you can this.resolve into the handler
[09:24:49] <jaubourg> heh
[09:24:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:24:58] <DaveMethvin> as long as ppl don't take it as a feature :D
[09:25:06] <jaubourg> haha
[09:25:13] <DaveMethvin> progress? no way you're done!
[09:25:22] <jaubourg> I'll try to divine a solution but it will involve some trickeries in Callbacks
[09:25:45] <jaubourg> I'll pass through a pull request if I find something just half bad... as opposed to full bad
[09:26:01] <jaubourg> do I rework the sourceURL thingy btw?
[09:26:26] <DaveMethvin> i think we were just going to put it in one place? Refresh my memory
[09:26:34] <DaveMethvin> i know the original was pretty far reaching
[09:26:59] <jaubourg> yeah, just for scripts that are requested same-domain thus executed through globalEval
[09:27:09] <DaveMethvin> since it's just debugging i think that's fine
[09:27:15] <jaubourg> those are the ones debug info was missing for
[09:27:25] <jaubourg> no inline script tag handling
[09:27:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:27:44] <DaveMethvin> although we could make up file names for those cases
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> elfporn.js
[09:27:51] <jaubourg> I'll just commit something then, it's pretty simple to deal with
[09:27:56] <jaubourg> haha
[09:28:09] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then, if nobody has anything else let's call it a meeting
[09:28:25] <DaveMethvin> see you back in -dev!
[09:28:29] <jaubourg> cool, I'll fly now, have a good afternoon americans ;)
[09:28:33] <mikesherov> wait
[09:28:40] <DaveMethvin> yes mikesherov?
[09:28:46] * jaubourg waits
[09:28:51] <mikesherov> so chrome 20 and safari 5.1.7 broke pixels/percentages again
[09:28:58] <DaveMethvin> TELL THEM TO STOP!
[09:29:07] <DaveMethvin> what is wrong with those guys?
[09:29:10] <mikesherov> Do we have time to get fixes in for this?
[09:29:33] <DaveMethvin> rc1 is next week, how extensive are the changes?
[09:29:51] <mikesherov> probably just paving over more values with dean edwards hack
[09:30:03] <mikesherov> probably get them to you by wednesday
[09:30:05] <DaveMethvin> oh boy, awesome  hack
[09:30:08] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:30:12] <mikesherov> or tonight if I have time
[09:30:16] <mikesherov> just been slammed
[09:30:23] <mikesherov> OK, I'll do my best
[09:30:33] <DaveMethvin> ok i saw  you got that ticket
[09:31:01] <DaveMethvin> alrighty, i'll see you guys in -dev
