[12:05:00] <arschmitz> Hi
[12:05:54] <bethge> Hi
[12:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> So, next week is the Pointer Events hackathon.
[12:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> So there won't be a PEP meeting next week.
[12:09:32] <arschmitz> Ok
[12:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> There hasn't been any real action in the WG this past week.
[12:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> And not much going on in our repo either.
[12:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> All of my available time has been going into figuring out what's causing jQuery UI's download builder to break.
[12:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> But we're so close to having the release announced, and then I'll have much more time for PEP :-)
[12:11:26] <arschmitz> Yeah similar with me once mobile 1.5 is done in plan more time for pep
[12:12:05] <bethge> Sounds great :-), I have just been swaped with work and my studies, exams are coming up after that I hope I'll more time
[12:12:06] <arschmitz> My change log is orphaned on dead laptop right now
[12:12:31] <arschmitz> And it's the only blocker ðŸ˜¿
[12:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> For mobile?
[12:13:38] <arschmitz> Yes
[12:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it sounds like we don't have too much to talk about today.
[12:16:17] <scott_gonzalez> I did get a fix in to automate updating the versions in the README during a release: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/249
[12:16:39] <arschmitz> Yeah I looked at that
[12:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today, unless anyone has something else to discuss.
[12:20:47] <arschmitz> Nothing
[12:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone use React?
[12:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> There was never a PR for https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/255
[12:21:39] <arschmitz> I don't but Jorn does
[12:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> So unless someone is interested in sending one, I'm going to close that and say that we'll happily accept a PR, but it's not something the team will be doing.
[12:22:18] <bethge> Yeah, sorry, haven't gone further than the tutorial.
[12:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Any interest in sending a PR for React usage of PEP?
[12:23:03] <arschmitz> I really want to fix 151
[12:23:25] <arschmitz> Which fixes it just need mobile 1.5 to be done to have time
[12:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> Re-reading this thread, it's pretty long...
[12:30:18] <arschmitz> Short version use the style attribute instead of a custom attribute
[12:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> So, the one thing with that is you wouldn't be able to properly check the `touch-action` value as a user, right?
[12:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> Because you'd do `elem.style.touchAction = "pan-x"`
[12:31:03] <arschmitz> I've had at work very successfully on Hammertime which is used in tons of ember apps at this point
[12:31:16] <scott_gonzalez> And then later if you did `alert(elem.style.touchAction)` you wouldn't get the value.
[12:31:19] <arschmitz> No you can't directly access the style property you need to access the attribute
[12:31:43] <arschmitz> That's the one catch of it is of attribute Bross I'll style processing has to be done via the attribute not the style property because the style property triggers browser sanitation
[12:32:15] <arschmitz> Sorry voice to text on my way to get some lunch
[12:32:48] <arschmitz> Oh sorry I totally miss read what you said no you're exactly right that's exactly in thing I was saying
[12:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...is this all browsers that sanitize?
[12:34:26] <arschmitz> Yes all browsers sanitize style prop
[12:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/vogupezoye/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:35:53] <arschmitz> Set any style property and then check it again
[12:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/tipiwavato/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:36:37] <arschmitz> Only the satyr does sanitation not to getter
[12:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> I think the sanitization is only in the style attribute.
[12:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> Not the style property.
[12:37:33] <arschmitz> Interesting I wonder if they've change something
[12:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> Pulling up IE 11 to test right now.
[12:38:05] <arschmitz> I need to check it again it's been a little while since I looked at it
[12:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> works fine
[12:38:22] <bethge> same for safari
[12:38:28] <arschmitz> Have you checked in a browser that doesn't actually support such action though
[12:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> Firefox, Chrome work fine
[12:38:39] <arschmitz> Hmm
[12:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> This isn't touch-action, it's a completely custom property.
[12:39:08] <arschmitz> Right
[12:39:31] <arschmitz> Custom styles of always been completely ignored that's really weird
[12:39:45] <arschmitz> I need to dig into this more when I get home
[12:40:01] <arschmitz> Would certainly make it a lot easier
[12:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> works in Opera
[12:40:20] <arschmitz> Implementation wise because before I had to use a mutation observer to unsanitized it when it got sanitized
[12:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> works in Edge
[12:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's all the browsers.
[12:40:40] <arschmitz> Yup
[12:40:58] <arschmitz> Maybe there's a different wrinkle to it I'm not remembering I left to go back to my test cases I still have them
[12:41:22] <arschmitz> This is a time I certainly hope that I'm wrong though and that this does work
[12:41:31] <scott_gonzalez> `elem.style.cssText` doesn't include it.
[12:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> But the property still exists on the `style` object.
[12:42:15] <arschmitz> Ok
[12:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> Setting `style.cssText` doesn't kill the custom property either.
[12:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> `.setAttribute('style', 'whatever')` also doesn't kill the custom property.
[12:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer-time/blob/master/hammer-time.js#L38-L42
[12:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> You're going through the attribute, not the property.
[12:45:08] <arschmitz> Yeah must be the attribute that get sanitize not the property I guess I must not of checked out or something
[12:45:23] <arschmitz> Awesome catch that definitely works better and simplifies things
[12:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> I bet the problem you're trying to solve is <div style="touch-action: pan-x">
[12:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> And reading the initial value.
[12:46:02] <arschmitz> Yup
[12:46:26] <arschmitz> Yeah I think that's exactly right but could potential he optimize by then storing internally
[12:46:53] <arschmitz> To the property instead of the attribute
[12:47:53] <arschmitz> And this would be the same for Pat because the whole ideas of this was to be able to just place this in their mark up and we detect it
[12:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well at least we've got an action item!
[12:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's it for today.
[12:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[12:50:24] <bethge> Thanks, have fun in Redmond! :-)
[12:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks!
[14:17:51] <apsdehal> Hey!
[14:17:58] <gabrielschulhof> Hey! arschmitz not here today?
[14:17:59] <arschmitz> Thank you jasper
[14:18:02] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:18:05] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, there you are :)
[14:18:16] <jasperdegroot> you're welcome
[14:18:16] <arschmitz> My laptop died and I couldn't get commands to work from phone
[14:18:32] <gabrielschulhof> Oooh! Hate it when that happens! :/
[14:18:32] <arschmitz> To op and unmute
[14:18:52] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Should've used an N900 :)
[14:19:02] <gabrielschulhof> + irssi :)
[14:19:09] <arschmitz> Yeah and Apple is fighting between departments over who's going to ot for and fix it
[14:19:24] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: your n900 still alive?
[14:19:36] <gabrielschulhof> I used it the other day as a remote for my DVD player.
[14:19:44] <arschmitz> Awesome
[14:20:16] <gabrielschulhof> The battery doesn't really work anymore, and the SIM card broke, so GSM is out, but it works.
[14:20:24] <arschmitz> So apsedehal got started on some docs updates for classes this week
[14:20:46] <arschmitz> I was working on change log but it's on dead laptop
[14:21:13] <apsdehal> I am not able to setup jquery-wp-content
[14:21:31] <apsdehal> I do vagrant up and then the box starts downloading and then it slowly dies
[14:21:35] <arschmitz> What was the issue you had I'll ping infra
[14:21:40] <jasperdegroot> aww
[14:21:41] <arschmitz> Ok
[14:23:27] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: Were you able to do something about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8355
[14:23:30] <arschmitz> Talking to them now
[14:23:42] <jasperdegroot> I think I will have a bit time this weekend to do some more work on demos
[14:23:43] <gabrielschulhof> Looking ...
[14:24:14] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: No, sorry.
[14:24:22] <jasperdegroot> and finish that auto-prefix PR
[14:24:28] <arschmitz> Nice
[14:24:40] <arschmitz> Once I get laptop back in going to finish change log
[14:24:59] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: I was looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8334
[14:25:08] <apsdehal> jasperdegroot: Does the demo issue has all the api regarding changes we need to make to demos in the checklist?
[14:25:32] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: I am afraid not all
[14:25:36] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: great! is it feasible?
[14:26:30] <apsdehal> jasperdegroot: maybe I can help with that, but I am not sure about all api changes, maybe changelog will help with that.
[14:26:45] <apsdehal> but that is on dead laptop now :(
[14:26:49] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: Is what feasible?
[14:27:11] <jasperdegroot> yeah, same here ... the changes that are missing in the checklist are the ones I wasn't aware of
[14:27:14] <apsdehal> Listview refresh because it was heavy
[14:27:44] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: Yes. I will break it up as discussed. I have to tread carefully though and run the tests at every turn to make sure I don't break anything.
[14:27:54] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: Looks good so far though.
[14:28:04] <apsdehal> great
[14:28:23] <arschmitz> Great
[14:28:44] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: I was wondering if you can update https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/316 so we can land it
[14:28:50] <arschmitz> Gabriel if you could try to start figuring out docs changed for things you worked on too
[14:28:52] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: I think it's best if we check all demo pages between alpha and final
[14:29:18] <apsdehal> Yes, api for button etc needs to be changed
[14:29:20] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... the docs ...
[14:29:22] <apsdehal> *demos
[14:30:06] <apsdehal> I will try to work on demos once I update docs to a good state
[14:30:14] <arschmitz> A good guide for this in widgets is look at the back compt file
[14:30:22] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: awesome!
[14:31:10] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: I'm not sure if https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/316 is correct anymore. IIRC cgack re-did the table, so he should also go over it once.
[14:31:21] <apsdehal> Sure
[14:34:48] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Can you also ask infra about ui documentation issue of not displaying classes option
[14:35:00] <arschmitz> They know
[14:35:06] <arschmitz> Go to stage
[14:35:19] <arschmitz> It's not deploying any site to production currently
[14:35:37] <apsdehal> How do we access stage?
[14:36:13] <arschmitz> Put stage. In front
[14:36:16] <arschmitz> Of any site
[14:36:35] <apsdehal> Yep, got it http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/
[14:37:30] <apsdehal> Also I won't be able to attend next week's meeting, have the visa interview.
[14:37:43] <arschmitz> Oh awesome good luck
[14:38:00] <apsdehal> Thanks!
[14:42:15] <arschmitz> Anything else today?
[14:42:46] <jasperdegroot> I am good
[14:42:48] <gabrielschulhof> Not here.
[14:42:57] <apsdehal> Not from me, issue count is 75 now lol , the targeted milestone
[14:43:15] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: good luck with the interview
[14:43:20] <jasperdegroot> 75 wow
[14:43:25] <jasperdegroot> awesome work!!
[14:43:46] <apsdehal> Thanks a lot jasper!
[14:44:07] <jasperdegroot> was just checking the download builder, seems like that works fine with master
[14:44:30] <jasperdegroot> next is the theme roller, hopefully it won't be too much work to update it
[14:44:54] <apsdehal> awesome!
[14:45:22] <arschmitz> Jasper wait what
[14:45:31] <arschmitz> DB should not work with master at all lol
[14:45:48] <arschmitz> I need to check that out
[14:45:59] <arschmitz> We got rid of all the comments to power it
[14:46:06] <apsdehal> Oh
[14:46:31] <jasperdegroot> oww
[14:46:34] <apsdehal> There was issue about download builder also about comments in file about which widget it is
[14:46:43] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I just did a download with latest
[14:47:00] <apsdehal> arschmitz: closed it I guess
[14:47:04] <arschmitz> Is it actually correct build?
[14:47:18] <jasperdegroot> not sure
[14:47:24] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8478
[14:47:26] <jasperdegroot> I checked all components
[14:47:35] <jasperdegroot> and there was code in the JS files
[14:48:02] <arschmitz> Jasper I don't see most of the components that should be there
[14:48:25] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you mean you don't see it in the generated JS file?
[14:48:34] <arschmitz> The menu
[14:49:37] <arschmitz> Yeah latest is actually building 1.4.5
[14:50:07] <jasperdegroot> aha
[14:50:15] <jasperdegroot> the comment in the file said 1.5-pre
[14:50:31] <arschmitz> Maybe some old checkout
[14:50:36] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:50:45] <arschmitz> But the code is old
[14:50:48] <arschmitz> No enhancer
[14:50:50] <jasperdegroot> anyways, this is not a blocker for alpha
[14:50:57] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:50:58] <arschmitz> Old page widget
[14:51:13] <arschmitz> We should remove latest though
[14:51:18] <arschmitz> To avoid co fusion
[14:51:30] <jasperdegroot> yes agreed
[14:51:53] <jasperdegroot> I will open a ticket for that
[14:51:54] <arschmitz> Ok so it points at master
[14:52:08] <arschmitz> I wonder if it has not updated since we updated master
[14:52:23] <arschmitz> I'll look into it
[14:52:27] <jasperdegroot> cool
[14:53:15] <jasperdegroot> I will mute the channel
[14:53:17] <jasperdegroot> later all
