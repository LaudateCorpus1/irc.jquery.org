[11:02:09] <toddparker> we should be unmoderated now
[11:02:25] <toddparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting.
[11:02:29] <toddparker> Chime in if you're here
[11:02:41] <gseguin> here
[11:02:47] <scottjehl> here
[11:03:47] * jzaefferer gets popcorn
[11:04:36] <toddparker> just waiting to see if _nickel can get on
[11:05:05] <toddparker> let's start by doing a check in on what everyone's working on right now
[11:05:15] <toddparker> gseguin - want to start?
[11:05:23] <gseguin> sure
[11:05:36] <gseguin> let's see
[11:05:55] <gseguin> been working with project707 on filtering listview
[11:06:26] <gseguin> the transitions are not progressing even though I have spent time on it
[11:06:39] <gseguin> there is a flash happening on reverse transition on iphone
[11:06:42] <gseguin> not on ipad
[11:06:47] <toddparker> hmm
[11:07:05] <toddparker> is that the major snag right now on transitions or are there other problems?
[11:07:38] <gseguin> I haven't tried it on android in the current state
[11:08:06] <gseguin> I will do that now and report
[11:08:15] <toddparker> ok
[11:08:34] <toddparker> do you need help or another set of eyes?
[11:09:08] <gseguin> I think so, one of you CSS experts
[11:09:22] <toddparker> ok, we can take a look next week
[11:09:34] <toddparker> i think this will be a beta 3 change so we can wait
[11:09:48] <gseguin> ok
[11:09:50] <toddparker> heck, maybe opera will land a fix and we can add it back in
[11:09:58] <gseguin> heh
[11:10:04] <toddparker> on the listview filter, what's the latest?
[11:10:06] <gseguin> that would be great
[11:10:22] <gseguin> waiting for _nickel's input
[11:10:44] <gseguin> project707 wants another member to bless the direction he's going in
[11:11:02] <toddparker> ok, maybe he'll chime in soon
[11:11:02] <gseguin> to not "waste" cycles
[11:11:09] <toddparker> anything else you've been looking at?
[11:11:14] <gseguin> yeah he's supposed to review that today
[11:11:31] <gseguin> yeah, hold on
[11:11:35] <toddparker> k
[11:11:43] <gseguin> I'm going to land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2102
[11:12:03] <toddparker> if there are any bug fixes you want to land for beta 2, tomorrow will prolly be the cutoff
[11:12:19] <gseguin> alright, I'll spend the rest of the day on bugs then
[11:12:19] <toddparker> cool
[11:12:24] <toddparker> super
[11:12:42] <gseguin> that's it for me
[11:12:46] <scottjehl> nice. So _nickel felt better about that change after I dropped off?
[11:12:57] <scottjehl> the LI indices change
[11:13:14] <gseguin> transitions are awesome on android btw
[11:13:19] <gseguin> including reverse
[11:13:25] <toddparker> nice. better than master?
[11:13:33] <gseguin> hmm
[11:13:38] <gseguin> let me check that
[11:13:44] <toddparker> ok
[11:13:57] <toddparker> so scottjehl...you're up
[11:14:07] <scottjehl> ok
[11:14:30] <scottjehl> so, I'd been working on a few things lately
[11:14:31] <gseguin> scottjehl: _nickel said to land it he'll look at it later
[11:14:51] <scottjehl> we had a regression on the degradeInputs option of the page plugin
[11:15:23] <scottjehl> it was removed in decoupling.
[11:15:29] <scottjehl> Now it's back, but it's in a separate file
[11:15:38] <scottjehl> so we're good on that
[11:16:00] <scottjehl> umm. auto-init option landed
[11:16:40] <scottjehl> pretty basic. It doesn't change any existing behavior, but you can disable auto initialization if you want to call $.mobile.initializePage() on your own
[11:17:12] <scottjehl> many people requested this so they could do things like generating the markup with js before init. Not something we'd recommend, but they can do it now :)
[11:17:16] <toddparker> woo hoo
[11:17:22] <scottjehl> k let's see
[11:17:50] <scottjehl> oh, ajax-dom-caching should be ready to merge
[11:18:10] <scottjehl> _nickel helped me out with a few things and added some great tests
[11:18:23] <gseguin> I thought you were going to rename it?
[11:18:24] <scottjehl> I think it's on him at this point to land it when he feels it's ready
[11:18:30] <toddparker> that would be sweet to land for beta 2 if we can
[11:18:32] <scottjehl> ah. good call
[11:18:42] <scottjehl> so yeah, I'm open to renaming it
[11:18:43] <toddparker> did we agree on a name?
[11:18:48] <scottjehl> we should discuss in dev channel
[11:18:54] <gseguin> ok
[11:19:03] <scottjehl> totally agree it's too long though
[11:19:04] <toddparker> guess we can pick that up later when _nickel is on
[11:19:15] <scottjehl> currently, I'm working on pushstate
[11:19:16] <toddparker> dom cache
[11:19:28] <scottjehl> I think I found a much lighter way to bring it in
[11:19:32] <scottjehl> we'll see
[11:19:35] <toddparker> pushState would be me and everyone else very happy
[11:19:55] <scottjehl> that's my #1 feature too
[11:19:57] <toddparker> much easier to view page source in the docs w/o hacking the URLs
[11:20:03] <toddparker> yeah
[11:20:08] <scottjehl> much easier to not break the web too ;)
[11:20:17] <toddparker> heh, that too yeah
[11:20:37] <toddparker> we don't break it, just dent it, maybe kick it a bit
[11:20:53] <scottjehl> k what else
[11:20:57] <toddparker> so on my end, i'm working on this week's blog post
[11:21:31] <scottjehl> oh - each widget has an initSelector plugin, which can be configured to customize which elements are auto initialized as that widget
[11:21:38] <scottjehl> sorry option
[11:21:39] <scottjehl> not plugin
[11:22:19] <scottjehl> that's only in the widget factory plugins
[11:22:22] <toddparker> i need to document that
[11:22:26] <scottjehl> cool
[11:22:57] <gseguin> doc looks good btw toddparker
[11:23:04] <toddparker> thanks
[11:23:05] <scottjehl> i'm done. Todd?
[11:23:09] <scottjehl> yeah great work!
[11:23:15] <toddparker> pretty simple. i was following the UI docs
[11:23:33] <toddparker> so i tweeted the link to the select docs for feedback
[11:23:35] <toddparker> all good so far
[11:23:41] <gseguin> great
[11:23:42] <toddparker> better than nothin' anyway
[11:23:48] <gseguin> transitions are not working on FF mobile beta :(
[11:23:55] <toddparker> yeah, noticed that
[11:24:01] <toddparker> not supported yet?
[11:24:14] <toddparker> so for docs, i created a ticket here:
[11:24:14] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2161
[11:24:37] <toddparker> that has a link to the select example, wiki page with steps to follow when writing docs
[11:25:04] <toddparker> to keep people from stepping on toes, i'm suggesting they comment on the ticket to claim a plugin
[11:25:12] <toddparker> then submit pull requests
[11:25:37] <toddparker> the one thing that came up is that obviously, html markup isn't terribly structured
[11:25:48] <toddparker> so the ideal situation would be to author these in xml
[11:25:58] <rwaldron> it's too bad that github "assign to" requires that a user be a collaborator
[11:25:58] <toddparker> then transform that into multiple formats as needed
[11:26:06] <toddparker> yeah
[11:26:25] <toddparker> rwaldron, i've been adding non-committers as tags, tehn using that to assign
[11:26:32] <toddparker> interested in helping out?
[11:26:38] <rwaldron> possibly
[11:26:46] <rwaldron> i'd have to read through ticket first :)
[11:26:47] <toddparker> cool
[11:26:51] <rwaldron> tickets*
[11:27:01] <toddparker> cool
[11:27:45] <toddparker> here is a shiny new label for you
[11:27:45] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=rwaldron&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1
[11:27:58] <toddparker> can you label issues
[11:28:05] <toddparker> is not, ping me an i'll do it
[11:28:11] <toddparker> for you
[11:29:21] <toddparker> just removed the "Ghislain" label too
[11:29:33] <toddparker> assigned all those to gseguin now that he's official
[11:29:34] <gseguin> I was going to do that
[11:29:37] <gseguin> thanks
[11:29:38] <toddparker> did it
[11:30:38] <toddparker> ok, so on docs i think we're probably going to just stick with html unless someone wants to get all crazy on some xslt
[11:30:42] <toddparker> blech
[11:31:07] <toddparker> { crickets }
[11:31:11] <eddiemonge> markdown
[11:31:23] <toddparker> hey eddiemonge
[11:32:00] <eddiemonge> the learning site is currently using markdown and it seems to be fine. xml is a bit too structured
[11:32:01] <toddparker> i think there needs to be an offline sync between the teams and infrastructure to nail down a docs format and technology so we're all using the same tools
[11:32:26] <toddparker> this is why i haven't been able to move forward on the API stuff
[11:32:42] <gseguin> ideally the API doc should be pulled out of the code via JSDoc or similar, don't you think?
[11:32:42] <toddparker> going old skool html to get something out there
[11:32:53] <toddparker> then we can all get the tech sorted
[11:33:03] <toddparker> all good ideas
[11:33:11] <toddparker> but different ideas ideas :)
[11:33:41] <eddiemonge> i think using JSDoc would require major changes in the code wouldnt it?
[11:34:03] <gseguin> that's why I prefixed my statement with "ideally" ;)
[11:34:09] <toddparker> heh
[11:34:42] <toddparker> i'm open to whatever is best, but doing this right will require some time and coordination between projects
[11:35:02] <toddparker> so we'll keep it simple for now
[11:35:19] <toddparker> i'd like to get the docs filled out in the next month so they are ready for 1.0
[11:35:26] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:35:30] <scottjehl> yep
[11:35:41] <toddparker> think we can all agree that any of these ideas will prolly take a lot longer than that
[11:35:44] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:36:03] <toddparker> so let's try to land an many branches and fixes by tomorrow
[11:36:10] <toddparker> and plan on beta 2 going out early next week
[11:36:20] <toddparker> i need to ask mr. resig waht day will workf or him
[11:36:31] <toddparker> i'll start pasting together the release notes
[11:36:51] <toddparker> the blog posts make this a cinch. copy and paste from the weekly posts and we're done
[11:37:14] <toddparker> anything else we need to hash out now?
[11:37:24] <gseguin> nothing here
[11:37:52] <toddparker> ok, we can corner _nickel on -dev and find out what he's up to
[11:38:07] <toddparker> alright, if there's no other bizness, we can wrap up
[11:38:33] <gseguin> see you on -dev
[11:38:36] <toddparker> thanks everbody!
[11:38:40] <toddparker> over and out
