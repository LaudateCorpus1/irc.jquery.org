[11:06:14] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[11:06:20] <cgack> howdy
[11:06:25] <sfrisk> hey, I'm in a meeting for work right now, so ping me if you need me
[11:07:47] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:10:36] <arschmitz> ok so lets get started
[11:11:08] <arschmitz> i did a final review of listview this week and its good to land
[11:11:14] <arschmitz> but i dont think iv seen it land yet
[11:11:16] <gabrielschulhof> ... and landed it has.
[11:12:07] <arschmitz> oh ok missed that sorry
[11:12:19] <arschmitz> i did a round of updates on ui button stuff
[11:12:26] <arschmitz> and its got another round of review already
[11:12:27] <gabrielschulhof> NP. Believe me, it takes nothing away from the relief I've felt when landing it :)
[11:13:37] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:13:45] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else this week
[11:13:53] <arschmitz> i didnt see any PR's assigned to me when i went through
[11:14:02] <arschmitz> well that were not my own
[11:14:11] <gabrielschulhof> I'm making progress on selectmenu.
[11:14:16] <jasperdegroot> no update from me
[11:14:20] <gabrielschulhof> Adding the theming and backcompat stuff.
[11:14:42] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: execlent selectmenu is the last really glaring problem
[11:14:42] <jasperdegroot> didn't have time to work on the demos
[11:14:53] <arschmitz> panel and table and nav bar still need updates
[11:15:00] <arschmitz> butthey are not totally broken like selectmenu
[11:15:19] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, and panel and table have the thorny problem of already having a classes option, but with different semantics/mechanics.
[11:15:36] <arschmitz> yeah thats a touch one
[11:15:48] <arschmitz> im almost leaning towards
[11:15:58] <arschmitz> backcompat false new classes option
[11:16:02] <arschmitz> other wise old
[11:16:07] <arschmitz> and not try to mix them
[11:16:53] <gabrielschulhof> It might be possible to accomplish that if we override this._(add|remove)Class
[11:17:07] <gabrielschulhof> ... for the backcompat case.
[11:17:27] <arschmitz> yeah thats kinda what i was thinking
[11:17:52] <gabrielschulhof> OK. That's not bad.
[11:17:59] <gabrielschulhof> ... but lessee
[11:18:19] <arschmitz> because i think trying to make them play nce is going to be a ton of work
[11:18:48] <gabrielschulhof> I vaguely remember running into a fundamental problem that makes it impossible - though it /was/ a while ago.
[11:19:05] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:19:19] <arschmitz> id rather just get it dont then spend a ton of time on backcompat
[11:19:31] <apsdehal> Hi, sorry I am little late
[11:19:41] <arschmitz> apsdehal: no problem
[11:20:38] <cgack> for me its slow going on navbar, haven't had much time to take a look but should get some time soon
[11:21:08] <arschmitz> cgack: ok
[11:21:21] <arschmitz> when ever your ready for another round of review just let me knw
[11:21:31] <jasperdegroot> btw - the toolbar issues you see in the demos on 1.5-dev are fixed in 1.5-demos-issues branch
[11:21:41] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesoe
[11:22:09] <jasperdegroot> I could do a PR already if you want
[11:22:29] <arschmitz> cgack: whatever is better for you
[11:22:36] <jasperdegroot> but will continue with fixing other demos issues
[11:23:26] <jasperdegroot> can also wait if you prefer to review some more commits  at once
[11:23:35] <jasperdegroot> wait with PR that is
[11:23:40] <cgack> i'm not sure i have an opinion there
[11:29:26] <jasperdegroot> am I dc?
[11:30:03] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: huh?
[11:30:12] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Nope. ICU.
[11:30:13] <jasperdegroot> if I am disconnected
[11:30:30] <jasperdegroot> didn't see any message for long time
[11:30:59] <arschmitz> yeah does anyone have anything else this week?
[11:31:30] <cgack> I don't have anything
[11:31:42] <jasperdegroot> nope, I am good too
[11:31:49] <gabrielschulhof> Same here.
[11:31:57] <apsdehal> arschmitz: When will you review cleanup prs?
[11:32:25] <arschmitz> apsdehal: its on my to do but honestly a little low right this second since its not 100% needed for beta
[11:32:45] <arschmitz> we need to get it done though so i will get to it
[11:33:13] <apsdehal> cool
[11:45:57] <arschmitz> ok well lets call this one i think
[11:46:05] <arschmitz> see everyone next week / back on dev
[11:46:18] <gabrielschulhof> K L8R
