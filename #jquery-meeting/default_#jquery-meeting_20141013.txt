[08:58:11] <DaveMethvin> brb
[09:00:43] <DaveMethvin> ok i'm back
[09:00:49] <DaveMethvin> wow a turnout
[09:00:51] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:01:04] <jaubourg> hey :)
[09:01:20] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg, markelog, gibson042, who else?
[09:01:27] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:01:42] <jaubourg> what do I always hear the nespresso music "what else?"
[09:01:48] <jaubourg> what = why
[09:01:56] <DaveMethvin> it's a holiday today in the US but jquery never sleeps
[09:02:06] <jaubourg> sounds like a james bond title
[09:02:10] <DaveMethvin> sometimes it rests a bit
[09:02:20] <DaveMethvin> so let's see
[09:02:35] <DaveMethvin> i've got the agenda started https://docs.google.com/document/d/1su2ZTFZbnp_DD-LGZleuEudTFRJT_g4zf7UfGOMQvco/edit
[09:03:10] <DaveMethvin> i was gonna try to migrate trac issues but trac was not cooperating when i tried
[09:03:45] <DaveMethvin> it's been really nice to use gh issues
[09:03:52] <jaubourg> :)
[09:04:17] <DaveMethvin> supposedly our volunteers are still working on trac
[09:04:57] <DaveMethvin> so, question on tagging issues that only apply to the -compat branch
[09:05:01] <markelog> more PR's more issues with github
[09:05:05] <m_gol> present
[09:05:06] <markelog> which is good
[09:05:10] <markelog> i guess )
[09:05:27] <DaveMethvin> at least they can open a ticket\
[09:05:34] <markelog> yep
[09:05:43] <DaveMethvin> so the milestone i think should be 3.0.0
[09:05:54] <markelog> they could do that through google cache, i usually do it like that )
[09:05:57] <DaveMethvin> and we have always released both branches at the tsame time
[09:06:24] <DaveMethvin> but do we need a tag on issues to say they only apply to the compat branch? i think it might be helpful
[09:06:38] <DaveMethvin> and one for only master as well i guess
[09:06:46] <m_gol> we can have a compat-only label
[09:06:49] <markelog> i think so to, we could create special label for it
[09:06:56] <m_gol> or master-only and 1.x-master-only
[09:07:06] <markelog> or only  1.x-master-only
[09:07:09] <DaveMethvin> so compat-only, master-only and no tag?
[09:07:23] <DaveMethvin> i think we should rename 1.x-master to compat or something
[09:07:27] <m_gol> right
[09:07:30] <markelog> yep
[09:07:32] <DaveMethvin> compat-master?
[09:07:33] <gibson042> +1
[09:07:40] <m_gol> 3.0.0 released on 1.x-master branch ;-)
[09:07:43] <m_gol> that would be weird
[09:07:46] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:07:48] <markelog> will we have compat-something else?
[09:07:51] <DaveMethvin> sense, that makes none
[09:07:54] <markelog> it could be just "compat"
[09:08:00] <m_gol> markelog: +1
[09:08:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay with compat being short
[09:09:26] <DaveMethvin> we should land most of the PRs before doing a rename
[09:10:12] <markelog> right, we have to do it in one action i suppose, so anothers PRs wouldn't pop up
[09:10:14] <m_gol> right, otherwise they'll all get closed
[09:11:26] <DaveMethvin> if we can get most of them landed we can push a new compat branch, just leave 1.x-master there
[09:11:29] <DaveMethvin> right?
[09:11:39] <DaveMethvin> then remove it later
[09:12:19] <DaveMethvin> it's probably just simpler to not have that be a long time between creating compat and removing 1.x-master
[09:12:20] <gibson042> sounds good to me
[09:12:44] <markelog> cool
[09:13:02] <DaveMethvin> ok, i think we just need to go thru these PRs, they've been accumulating for a while (my bad)
[09:13:03] <gibson042> after we have compat, it's easy to redirect misguided 1.x-master PRs
[09:13:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:13:11] <jaubourg> I have no clue what this name change entails... seems like I missed a discussion ;)
[09:13:32] <DaveMethvin> what we're calling 1.x now will be jquery-compat
[09:13:41] <DaveMethvin> and the version numbers will be the same for both
[09:13:42] <jaubourg> ok, why?
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> indicating they have the same api
[09:13:52] <jaubourg> oh ic
[09:13:55] <DaveMethvin> b/c suposedly that's what is important for semver
[09:14:14] <DaveMethvin> once we adopt semver all our problems will go away :)
[09:14:16] <DaveMethvin> hahhaha
[09:14:39] <jaubourg> lol
[09:14:42] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 do you have that PR for the chained .done() fix?
[09:15:06] <gibson042> I didn't get a chance to start until today, but it's about half done and looking allright
[09:15:20] <DaveMethvin> oh good!
[09:15:28] <DaveMethvin> see that's what holidays are for :)
[09:15:36] <DaveMethvin> if it wasn't for holidays i wouldn't get anything done
[09:15:37] <gibson042> exactly
[09:16:05] <DaveMethvin> markelog: how is $.xhr coming?
[09:16:27] <markelog> i'm working on it but i was a bit ill this weekend, i will catch up this week though
[09:16:37] <DaveMethvin> sorry about that, get better
[09:16:51] <markelog> i hope today i fully recover
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> if either of you can sucker jaubourg into doing some work, feel free :) maybe he can review the PRs
[09:17:33] <gibson042> lol
[09:17:36] * jaubourg quits IRC
[09:17:40] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:17:49] <DaveMethvin> quitter!
[09:17:53] <jaubourg> :P
[09:18:14] <DaveMethvin> i'm in the middle of writing the blog post describing our version change, i'll pass around a link to a google doc later this week
[09:18:28] <jaubourg> ok
[09:18:46] <jaubourg> as usual, I'll have to leave early (in like 5 minutes) FYI
[09:18:52] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:19:15] <m_gol> gibson042 markelog: you have 5 minutes to get jaubourg to do sth :-)
[09:19:18] <DaveMethvin> any specifics on PRs or issues we need to review?
[09:19:28] <jaubourg> :P
[09:19:33] <markelog> )
[09:19:38] <DaveMethvin> i am trying to learn French so I can speak to him in his language
[09:19:41] <DaveMethvin> it is hard
[09:19:58] <m_gol> so, I have an unrelated question
[09:20:06] <DaveMethvin> fire away
[09:20:10] <m_gol> how should we approach browser support, now in Sizzle and later in other repos
[09:20:11] <m_gol> that is
[09:20:31] <m_gol> I plan to someday write a module that will generate launchers object from our vague description
[09:20:40] <m_gol> like "firefox": "previous" etc.
[09:20:54] <m_gol> but I wondered that it might make sense to still keep the generated object in repo
[09:21:21] <m_gol> so that if we need to branch to e.g. fix a security issue we're sure in which browsers the repo was tested back then and make sure we don't break any of them
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> sort of as a documentation of supported browsers?
[09:21:46] <m_gol> the drawback will be that we'll still have commits like "Build: update tested browsers", it's just that it'll be generated automatically
[09:22:04] <gibson042> I don't think we need to capture anything until a release
[09:22:04] <m_gol> and we'll be able to avoid discussions like at https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/2c5f9b261d0e44c3a7e94ffa5b76b5a689535e25
[09:22:30] <DaveMethvin> i think a release is definitely when it matters
[09:22:32] <gibson042> snapshot supported browsers just like we snapshot the dist files
[09:22:41] <m_gol> gibson042: but that will be harder to test if we need to add a new commit over an old release
[09:23:04] <gibson042> not that hard
[09:23:04] <m_gol> since we'd then want to test on the same launchers file and if it's not in every commit it'll get regenerated into sth newer
[09:24:00] <gibson042> testing procedure would start with overriding/augmenting launchers with the old release copy
[09:24:04] <markelog> why would we need  "Build: update tested browsers"
[09:24:04] <markelog> ?
[09:24:41] <jaubourg> gotta fly... markelog, gibson042 if you need me for something, just mail me ;)
[09:24:52] <markelog> )
[09:25:16] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we've ever released a patch to an older version have we? so maybe we wait until the case arises?
[09:25:34] <DaveMethvin> we've patched release tags to fix issues with bower etc
[09:25:42] <m_gol> the problem is
[09:25:46] <m_gol> that if the case arises
[09:25:49] <m_gol> it's already too late ;)
[09:25:53] <m_gol> to check what was tested back then
[09:26:04] <DaveMethvin> all the better reason to continue our streak? :)
[09:26:20] <m_gol> unless we do what gibson042 says
[09:26:29] <m_gol> at least we'll have an array that's supposed to work
[09:26:38] <m_gol> we'd avoid needless commits and still get the info on releases
[09:26:52] <m_gol> and then we can really react to a need afterward
[09:26:52] <m_gol> s
[09:28:06] <DaveMethvin> the bigger question is how we communicate browser support for the current versions
[09:28:12] <m_gol> if this is going to be extremely rare as it's now, a manual process once every 100 years will not be a huge deal
[09:28:18] <m_gol> what do you mean?
[09:28:26] <DaveMethvin> we have compat and master, but those browser supports will vary over time
[09:28:54] <DaveMethvin> we don't do that great a job of saying what is supported by a specific release right now
[09:29:16] <DaveMethvin> i couldn't tell you what 1.8.2 supported
[09:29:35] <DaveMethvin> we know what the current ones are tested with and thus support
[09:29:43] <m_gol> so if we'll have launchers commited on tags, during jquery-release process, then we'll have the info ;)
[09:29:47] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:29:58] <m_gol> obviously, that's not technically identical to what we theoretically support
[09:30:02] <DaveMethvin> if they're specific versions
[09:30:02] <m_gol> at least in Sizzle
[09:30:09] <m_gol> they'll be specific versions
[09:30:11] <m_gol> that's the idea
[09:30:22] <m_gol> non-specific in the pattern, specific in the generated array
[09:30:25] <DaveMethvin> ok so we'll be good
[09:30:35] <markelog> on related note
[09:30:39] <m_gol> I don't plan to generate "current" etc., even thought BrowserStack supports some of them
[09:30:49] <markelog> should we still test stuff in Opera?
[09:31:01] <m_gol> right, this
[09:31:04] <m_gol> I think we should ;-)
[09:31:09] <DaveMethvin> i agree the engines aren't that different but what does it cost us to test?
[09:31:12] <DaveMethvin> just in case
[09:31:25] <DaveMethvin> also the engines won't be the same versions necessarily
[09:31:29] <markelog> nothing they practically the same
[09:31:46] <DaveMethvin> that is, current and current-1 of Opera may not be the same engine as current, current-1 of Chrome
[09:31:46] <m_gol> markelog's case as I understand it is that for him Opera is just one of many Chromium-based browsers but for me it's not just one of many
[09:32:12] <DaveMethvin> i'd think that opera might be a bit behind chrome
[09:32:13] <m_gol> Opera people are contributing a lot to Blink, they're definitely the most popular Chromium build besides Chrome etc.
[09:32:20] <markelog> DaveMethvin: right, but they will upgrade quite fast
[09:32:29] <markelog> but this is not the question i think
[09:32:37] <markelog> Opera have pretty small share
[09:32:40] <m_gol> but again, they don't have to be identicall *technically*
[09:32:52] <markelog> like In Russia my company developing their own browser
[09:32:59] <markelog> which is Chromium build
[09:33:07] <markelog> which has like 6% of share
[09:33:12] <markelog> just like Opera in Poland
[09:33:26] <markelog> but we don't test it, because its 0% world wide
[09:33:32] <DaveMethvin> they should get it on browserstack :)
[09:34:15] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't mind testing any browser with high market share somewhere, if it's possible and not too much hassle
[09:34:21] <markelog> so my thought it, if its just another Chromium build that does not have any shares
[09:34:26] <markelog> why we test it?
[09:34:30] <DaveMethvin> so if Opera is on the lower priority weekly job it's not much of a burden
[09:34:35] <m_gol> according to http://gs.statcounter.com/, Opera has 1.39% worldwide
[09:34:41] <DaveMethvin> and I'd test Yandex browser there if we could
[09:35:03] <markelog> there might an old version in there
[09:35:16] <m_gol> btw, we don't really have figured out our weekly test setup for Sizzle (and other Karma-based test infras in the future)
[09:35:24] <DaveMethvin> if it makes people feel more confident in the library and it's not a lot of work for us, i'm okay with continuing to test
[09:35:37] <markelog> all right, so Opera gonna stay
[09:35:38] <DaveMethvin> if it's a major hassle then let's skip it
[09:35:54] <m_gol> Opera Blink has 0.91%
[09:35:55] <markelog> and if Yandex browser will pop up in the browserstack we will add it too
[09:35:57] <m_gol> worldwide
[09:36:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:36:09] <DaveMethvin> i'm fine with that
[09:36:10] <markelog> will email bs about it
[09:36:11] <m_gol> it's rising as people are switching from the Presto one
[09:36:23] <markelog> most of them already swtich
[09:36:27] <markelog> to different browser )
[09:36:28] <DaveMethvin> and you can tell your boss you got it into our testing rotation markelog, they'll give you a bonus!
[09:36:30] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:36:37] <m_gol> but yeah, I'd be fine with testing it in the weekly run only
[09:36:37] <markelog> that is my plan!
[09:36:42] <DaveMethvin> it's working!
[09:36:56] <m_gol> we need to split infra configs btw
[09:37:04] <DaveMethvin> that keeps the main testing matrix down a bit, which is good
[09:37:14] <m_gol> "popular" is not cool as if we change anything there it'll affect other jQuery projects
[09:37:21] <m_gol> we should have dedicated browser sets IMO
[09:37:25] <DaveMethvin> i agree
[09:37:32] <m_gol> I can switch us to separate sets
[09:37:37] <DaveMethvin> that would be good
[09:38:14] <m_gol> I'll probably just create jquery & jquery-weekly
[09:38:28] <DaveMethvin> nicely named :)
[09:38:41] <DaveMethvin> surely there must be some way to bikeshed that
[09:38:45] <m_gol> and jquery-compat & jquery-compat-weekly ;-)
[09:38:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[09:39:28] <markelog> mm, btw Opera 12.x, could we removed it?
[09:39:37] <DaveMethvin> what is it down to now?
[09:39:40] <m_gol> markelog: from where?
[09:39:46] <DaveMethvin> weekly?
[09:39:55] <markelog> DaveMethvin: sounds good
[09:40:08] <DaveMethvin> i think we are dropping it after this next release anyway aren't we?
[09:40:11] <markelog> Sizzle probably should have it since it supports older browsers than Core
[09:40:14] <markelog> gibson042: ?
[09:40:20] <gibson042> Sizzle will keep it
[09:40:29] <m_gol> weekly is now Androids, Opera Presto & Safari 5.1
[09:40:39] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:40:41] <markelog> cool
[09:41:10] <m_gol> I think we should keep testing on Presto at least as long as Opera Mini servers are run by Presto
[09:41:21] <markelog> that might be a loooong time
[09:41:36] <DaveMethvin> there wasn't much that we do on the jquery side that i know of anyway
[09:41:37] <m_gol> the good thing is that once they switch to Blink the "market share" drops in one second ;)
[09:41:38] <markelog> they have like a TV setups with Presto
[09:41:39] <DaveMethvin> maybe one patch
[09:42:01] <markelog> so they wouldn't do the update like Firefox did
[09:42:08] <DaveMethvin> and if sizzle is keeping support then jquery will usually work, even if we're not testing it
[09:42:22] <m_gol> TVs are a separate things but Opera Mobile is extremely popular
[09:42:35] <m_gol> so as long as it's not a huge PITA, I think it'd be wise to check up on it
[09:42:46] <m_gol> in jQuery, since Sizzle is keeping the support anyway
[09:42:55] <m_gol> s/Mobile/Mini
[09:42:55] <markelog> only in Opera mini but not desktop Opera?
[09:42:59] <DaveMethvin> i think the opera folks were saying opera mini isn't even based off the latest 12.x desktop
[09:43:20] <DaveMethvin> its an older one, so we may not get accurate results vs mini behavior
[09:43:30] <m_gol> Opera mini is a proxy browser with servers running on Presto which is somewhat similar to what Opera Presto desktop has
[09:43:44] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah, but they're planning the switch
[09:43:46] <markelog> so if we have those browsers, will we fix stuff for them?
[09:44:00] <DaveMethvin> it depends on how hard it is to fix :)
[09:44:07] <m_gol> I mainly care to not break what's working now
[09:44:08] <DaveMethvin> they haven't been troublesome thankfully
[09:44:15] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:44:17] <m_gol> I'm fine with not caring about completely new issues
[09:44:20] <DaveMethvin> very much like our IE8 support
[09:44:24] <markelog> otherwise we gonna add a guard to falling test for them
[09:44:26] <DaveMethvin> just don't make it worse
[09:44:35] <markelog> ?
[09:44:58] <DaveMethvin> people seem to discover new things they think are bugs in ie8 every day
[09:45:00] <m_gol> markelog: it's not like we add a lot of stuff to support Opera, really...
[09:45:12] <markelog> because they are pretty much the same
[09:45:12] <markelog> )
[09:45:21] <DaveMethvin> yes, thank goodness!
[09:45:25] <markelog> !
[09:45:33] <DaveMethvin> ok ... anything else?
[09:46:06] <m_gol> we have only one support comment for Opera Prest
[09:46:07] <m_gol> o
[09:46:15] <DaveMethvin> sounds like we're done ... i'll be working on the PRs and will try to get some issues moved over from trac
[09:46:15] <markelog> what a nightmare!
[09:46:20] <markelog> )
[09:46:24] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:46:30] <markelog> see ya!
[09:46:33] <m_gol> Sizzle has one as well
[09:46:33] <DaveMethvin> see you later!
