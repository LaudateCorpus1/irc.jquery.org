[09:01:03] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:16] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> I've got nothing :-P
[09:03:01] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> This week's agenda is basically just a copy of last week.
[09:03:37] <tj_vantoll> here now
[09:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything to discuss?
[09:04:12] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is what has killed my entire week: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/pull/142
[09:04:12] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #142 by scottgonzalez (3h 36m ago): Case insensitive names & ability to remove a release
[09:04:50] <rxaviers> do you wanna give highlights on that? :P
[09:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> I had a few things on my todo between that and selectmenu review.
[09:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> But since that has taken me a full week so far (and it's not done), I've moved selectmenu review to the top of my list.
[09:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> So as soon as I finish this, I'll be doing my next review of selectmenu, which will hopefully result in a merge to master :-)
[09:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: ^
[09:06:12] <jzaefferer> that's something
[09:06:32] <fnagel> hey, sorry for the delay. Whats "this"?
[09:06:36] <jzaefferer> any idea when the plugins issue is gonna be done?
[09:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/pull/142
[09:06:56] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #142 by scottgonzalez (3h 39m ago): Case insensitive names & ability to remove a release
[09:06:57] <jzaefferer> I can probably help with the review tomorrow
[09:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to just take a shortcut and deal with the unfinished code later: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/pull/142#issuecomment-21487982
[09:08:11] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #142 by scottgonzalez (3h 40m ago): Case insensitive names & ability to remove a release
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> So hopefully today.
[09:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Let's plan on selectmenu review tomorrow. If I can't wrap up this plugins site issue I'll let you know.
[09:09:45] <jzaefferer> Okay, I'm on Skype even when not on IRC
[09:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:13:57] <rxaviers> Im working on DB to support AMD.
[09:14:18] <rxaviers> may I give some highlights?
[09:14:51] <rxaviers> DB use to concatenate the files to create the bundles. Now, Im using requirejs build process for the JS bundles.
[09:15:01] <rxaviers> I took the one I've just created for jquery-ui (grunt task) as a baseline and ported. It's partially working. But, the issue is: requirejs uses the filesystem to process the files and to create the built output.
[09:15:20] <rxaviers> But, luckly requirejs is very modular and we're able to patch its node/file module to "hack" it and use the current DB memory cache instead.
[09:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: jburke might be willing to provide an officially supported way to do that so that it's not a hack.
[09:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> But hacking in support is fine for now.
[09:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> Just something we might want to look into.
[09:19:19] <rxaviers> ok
[09:20:07] <rxaviers> ok
[09:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:25:56] <rxaviers> scott, I said patch, which implies changing files. To avoid confusion
[09:26:03] <rxaviers> this can be done dynamically
[09:26:14] <rxaviers> ok
[09:26:22] <rxaviers> requirejs.define("node/file", ...)
[09:26:38] <rxaviers> overload would be more accurate
