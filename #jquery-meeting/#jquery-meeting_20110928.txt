[09:00:10] <gnarf> Yay Meetings!
[09:00:28] <gnarf> something to keep my mind busy for the next hour at the airport :)
[09:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden seems to be inactive, so I guess we won't get the infrastructure update right now
[09:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> I emailed one of the co-founders of BrowserStack about setting up VMs to connect to TestSwarm
[09:03:25] <scott_gonzalez> haven't heard back yet
[09:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on widget factory docs
[09:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs/blob/master/how-jquery-ui-works.md
[09:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs/blob/master/why-use-the-widget-factory.md
[09:05:03] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez not much to update on :/
[09:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: let's have a breakout session about testing this weekend
[09:06:14] <danheberden> yeah - i'd like to get more onboard with wtf is going on with that stuff
[09:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron suggested having JohnResig do a walk-through of TestSwarm
[09:06:24] <danheberden> that'd be cool
[09:06:26] * rwaldron nods
[09:06:31] <gnarf> yeah, it would be
[09:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> I think JohnResig and jzaefferer could give us a lot of info on what exists and what needs to exist
[09:06:45] <rwaldron> we should all coordinate a time
[09:06:55] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez +9001 to that
[09:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> we'll be together on Friday, we can figure out a time then
[09:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: any update on other docs?
[09:08:59] <rworth> nope
[09:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: anything on animation tests?
[09:09:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no :(
[09:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> some of the existing effects tests are failing in Firefox
[09:10:08] <gnarf> i'll bump it up to the top of my prio lists
[09:10:09] <gnarf> yeah
[09:10:13] <gnarf> im not sure what to do about that
[09:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> possibly IE too (but they're not connected to TestSwarm right now)
[09:10:27] <gnarf> i basically can't make them work as best I can tell
[09:10:37] <gnarf> or at least, the stuff I'd need to do doesn't feel right
[09:10:48] <gnarf> I'm just gonna nuke the tests, might even back out the code for the "fix"
[09:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> let's go over what's broken this weekend before you do that
[09:11:11] <gnarf> k
[09:11:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez rwaldron: I can share what's going on with the testing team in general and QUnit and TestSwarm in detail; would be nice if John can join that, though he hasn't been involved in quite some time
[09:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> we're going to review the position stuff this weekend as well
[09:12:46] <jzaefferer> is anyone available Friday afternoon, before the evening activities?
[09:12:52] <jzaefferer> I'm coming in around 1pm
[09:13:14] <gnarf> I'm probably going to be around all day
[09:13:16] <jzaefferer> I'm hesitant to scheduling work during the conference hours, in my experience that rarely works out
[09:13:23] <gnarf> so yes
[09:13:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: when are you arriving?
[09:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> I get in at 1:46
[09:14:38] <jzaefferer> rwaldron is local anyway, right?
[09:14:48] <jzaefferer> we could meet at the (new) bocoup office?
[09:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> take about an hour to get to hotel from the airport
[09:15:15] <jzaefferer> right
[09:15:24] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yes, I am local
[09:15:32] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yep, we can do that
[09:15:49] <rwaldron> Friday is good for me
[09:15:53] <rwaldron> danheberden is already here
[09:16:01] <jzaefferer> 4pm at bocoup?
[09:16:05] <rwaldron> sounds good
[09:16:22] <jzaefferer> are you still in the same area?
[09:16:32] <rwaldron> yep
[09:16:37] <rwaldron> we're one block up
[09:16:42] <jzaefferer> ah, cool
[09:16:43] <rwaldron> same street
[09:16:48] <danheberden> sry, was blabbing in jquerymobile
[09:16:52] <rwaldron> but at the intersection
[09:17:06] <jzaefferer> I can't remember how to get there, so an address would help :-)
[09:17:13] <rwaldron> oh sorry
[09:17:20] <rwaldron> 355 Congress St.
[09:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> is the office a better meeting place than the hotel? most of us will be at the hotel and we have transportation to the theater from there
[09:17:40] <rwaldron> we'll have signs up for the training
[09:17:46] <rwaldron> so it will be hard to miss
[09:17:55] <danheberden> ill be on the training from 4:00 to 5pm or so
[09:17:56] <danheberden> and will be here
[09:17:59] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez which hotel?
[09:18:06] <rwaldron> we might be able to come to you
[09:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> Royal Sonesta
[09:18:19] <rwaldron> in cambridge?
[09:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:18:28] <danheberden> rwaldron ya just across the water
[09:18:34] <rwaldron> hahahah "transportation to the theatre"
[09:18:41] <rwaldron> it's down the street from the Royal Sonesta
[09:18:43] <rwaldron> :D
[09:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> oh, heh
[09:18:47] <danheberden> yeah, it's like 2 blocks
[09:18:47] <rwaldron> i think we can do that
[09:19:02] <danheberden> near that little shopping area
[09:19:02] <rwaldron> drive to you that is
[09:19:18] <danheberden> so what time are y'all planning then?
[09:19:24] <jzaefferer> ah, yeah, works for me
[09:19:31] <rwaldron> jzaefferer is that better?
[09:19:41] <jzaefferer> I might be there by 2pm, Scott a little later I guess
[09:19:44] <rwaldron> i have no problem with coming to the hotel
[09:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I should be there around 3pm
[09:20:01] <rwaldron> so, i think if that makes it easier for you guys, then let's do it
[09:20:08] <gnarf> I'm prolly there way before all of you so
[09:20:14] <gnarf> cept danheberden
[09:20:30] <gnarf> sounds like 3pm is the time
[09:20:55] <rwaldron> word
[09:21:07] <rwaldron> wait, scott_gonzalez gets there at 3
[09:21:13] <rwaldron> so, let's stick to 4
[09:21:18] <rwaldron> give him time to freshen up
[09:21:24] <gnarf> what time is the "pre-party" ?
[09:21:25] <rwaldron> i hate land-n-run
[09:21:28] <rwaldron> 7
[09:21:35] <rwaldron> or no, thats the movie
[09:21:36] <rwaldron> then dinner
[09:21:40] <rwaldron> then bocoup party
[09:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'll only need a few minutes to check-in and put my bag in my room
[09:22:45] <rwaldron> ok
[09:23:21] <jzaefferer> so 3pm, and if Scott's a little late, we can use the time to make sure we have wifi and stuff
[09:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein started rewriting draggable: https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js
[09:26:01] <gnarf> is Dave_Stein around?
[09:26:02] <jzaefferer> speaking of interactions: someone asked it we'd consider rewriting interactions as special events
[09:26:20] <jzaefferer> my main concern: how do you configure special events?
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> what's the point?
[09:27:16] <jzaefferer> mouseenter/mouseleave is more powerful then just a hover method
[09:27:33] <jzaefferer> seemed to be worth at least considering that for interactions
[09:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> but we already have dragstart/drag/dragstop
[09:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> what's the benefit of special events?
[09:28:53] <jzaefferer> dunno, nevermind
[09:29:59] <gnarf> heh
[09:30:55] <jzaefferer> on to selectmenu?
[09:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> any update?
[09:31:14] <jzaefferer> yes
[09:31:18] <jzaefferer> plenty!
[09:31:34] <jzaefferer> see http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu / http://view.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[09:31:51] <jzaefferer> I'm in touch with Felix mostly via direct email
[09:32:04] <jzaefferer> he already fixed some of the TODOs I listed there
[09:32:12] <jzaefferer> we should see further updates soon
[09:32:24] <jzaefferer> so after a long time of nothing, we're now making a lot of progress :-)
[09:32:33] <gnarf> looks good
[09:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> yay :-)
[09:32:47] <jzaefferer> if you test it and notice any issues, please add it to the TODOs list
[09:33:39] <jzaefferer> unfortunately I haven't heard anything from Hans in quite a while; last time we talked he wanted to push some updates, but that never happened
[09:34:10] <jzaefferer> need to land at least his datepicker/popup update, would be shame to not merge that
[09:37:44] <gnarf> I need to run
[09:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> I still need to send the email to the other libs about tabs key handling
[09:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> anything else to discuss?
[09:38:24] <kborchers> this should be ready to go http://jqbug.com/ui/p470
[09:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to test that stuff this weekend
[09:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> will you be at the conf?
[09:39:23] <kborchers> cool
[09:39:37] <kborchers> yeah, you mind if i sit in on that testing meeting. if just to listen and learn
[09:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> what time do you get in?
[09:39:55] <kborchers> 10:30
[09:40:19] <kborchers> so i can be there at 3
[09:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> cool, we'll make sure to find you :-)
[09:40:41] <kborchers> great, thanks
[09:41:46] <kborchers> oh, one other update i got the show/hide animation stuff for Popup done and am working on the other todos and then on to Menubar
[09:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:42:47] <jzaefferer> kborchers: you'll be at the hotel in the afternoon?
[09:43:06] <jzaefferer> maybe we can get some lunch together, if you don't mind waiting until ~2pm
[09:43:26] <jzaefferer> btw. I'm emailing Hans, asking about his status
[09:43:30] <kborchers> yeah, that sounds good
[09:56:32] <jzaefferer> and to finish off this meeting, kborchers just got commit access :-)
[09:56:43] <rworth> yay kborchers !
[09:56:44] <jzaefferer> 'bout time!
[09:57:15] <kborchers> :D
[09:59:00] <kborchers> And to think it all started with RewardJS. At least you got one of us to stick around rworth :)
[10:01:22] <rworth> :)
[10:02:38] <rworth> hey brado23
[10:02:51] <brado23> hey
[10:04:25] <rworth> hey chrisBannon
[10:04:34] <chrisBannon> hey
[10:06:10] <rworth> ok, let's get started
[10:06:30] <brado23> Boris is having hardward problems.  He'll be here in a moment.
[10:06:43] <rworth> ok
[10:09:17] <rworth> welcome borismoore
[10:09:24] <borismoore> Sorry - more hardware issues :(
[10:09:39] <rworth> care to kick us off with an update on jsRender?
[10:09:46] <borismoore> Sure
[10:10:13] <borismoore> I have quite a few updates committed and additional samples.
[10:10:27] <borismoore> Working also on demos for conf
[10:10:37] <borismoore> looking fairly good
[10:10:51] <borismoore> Nothing radically new to report after last weeks report
[10:11:24] <borismoore> jsviews will need to align with the codeless syntax etc, for binding expressions, but current integration nevertheless works fine
[10:11:36] <borismoore> I hope we can move to a beta of jsrender
[10:11:44] <borismoore> before too long
[10:11:55] <borismoore> jsviews beta would be staged subsequently
[10:12:12] <borismoore> that's the top level status
[10:12:29] <rworth> thanks
[10:12:47] <rworth> I'd like to update the jquery-tmpl readme to make it clear it is no longer being worked on, and will not come out of beta status
[10:12:55] <rworth> we get an issue files against it every couple days
[10:13:09] <borismoore> sure - would be a good idea
[10:13:19] <borismoore> I address that in the presentation too of course
[10:13:40] <rworth> sure. I'll mention it in my talk as well, since I'll talk about globalize and our work on templating
[10:13:59] <borismoore> ok
[10:14:09] <rworth> jzaefferer: do you have an update on editing?
[10:14:14] <rworth> or brado23?
[10:14:24] <brado23> is jzaefferer here?
[10:14:33] <jzaefferer> well, nothing new for editing itself
[10:14:45] <jzaefferer> mostly did a lot of integration work
[10:14:52] <jzaefferer> got rid of the -type and -datamodel folders
[10:15:04] <jzaefferer> grid-spf/tablesorter.html is new
[10:15:23] <jzaefferer> to get that to work, grid now supports extract tbody rows if no source option is specified
[10:15:29] <jzaefferer> but it needs localDataview for that
[10:15:46] <jzaefferer> when combined with menugrid, you get a full tablesorter without any configuration
[10:16:06] * gnarf needs to go - almost time to board the plane... Few updates to Timepicker / Mask this week - check out globalized inputs...  http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138092/Timepicker ( thats my big contribution this meeting - catch yall later! )
[10:16:09] <jzaefferer> localDataview got several updates to handle datatypes a lot better
[10:16:39] <brado23> I'm interested to take a closer look...
[10:16:42] <jzaefferer> the filter value is now parsed as well as to value to filter, so you can now sort currencies and dates properly, whatever Globalize supports
[10:17:00] <brado23> cool
[10:17:14] <jzaefferer> so localDataview is a lot more useful now
[10:17:31] <brado23> Is this all in the Grid branch then?
[10:17:33] <jzaefferer> I've started a "custom spreadsheet" demo, but its very barebones right now
[10:17:36] <jzaefferer> yep
[10:17:44] <jzaefferer> and we're going to land the markup merge very soon
[10:18:12] <jzaefferer> then move grid, observable and dataview to ui/
[10:18:21] <brado23> nice
[10:19:37] <borismoore> oh, btw on jsrender, the link for demos is now http://borismoore.github.com/jsrender/demos/step-by-step/index.html - just updated it in the agenda
[10:23:14] <jzaefferer> as part of Custom Inputs: gnarf mentioned his progress on timepicker, which is coming along pretty well, and we've got Felix Nagel working on selectmenu, which is now also wip: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[10:25:23] <brado23> chrisBannon might be interested in this...I believe I have what I need to integrate dataview/observable with my Upshot project....thanks to rworth and jzaefferer...just fyi
[10:26:07] <chrisBannon> nice, we are about to get back to focus on the dataSource stuff. Will have some feedback in the coming weeks i hope
[10:26:30] <brado23> great
[10:27:11] <jzaefferer> meh, bouncer crashing is not cool :/
[10:27:25] <jzaefferer> what did I miss since my message about custom inputs?
[10:28:19] <rworth> jzaefferer: I'll send offline
[10:29:26] <jzaefferer> chrisBannon: its now dataview, no datasource anymore :-)
[10:29:48] <jzaefferer> but yeah, your feedback on that is of course very welcome
[10:30:29] <jzaefferer> we at least don't plan any major changes for it anymore, so starting to integrate it elsewhere makes sense
[10:31:33] <chrisBannon> yeah, we will begin looking at integrating dataView with our widgets
[10:31:44] <chrisBannon> mainly wijgrid()
[10:33:07] <brado23> I hope to show grid over Upshot soon
[10:33:09] <borismoore> I'm going to have to reboot, again - do we have more?
[10:33:56] <borismoore> Did you say what Upshot was ? :)
[10:34:08] <borismoore> Maybe before I got in
[10:34:16] <borismoore> to the session
[10:34:18] <brado23> I'd discussed it in Skype calls...This is the new name for my project.
[10:34:21] <brado23> ...
[10:34:33] <borismoore> I wasn't on that call of course
[10:35:08] <brado23> It's a rich, model library that I'm building...integrates with jQuery UI and jsViews via DataModel...integrates with services/web APIs
[10:35:11] <chrisBannon> this is a bit off topic but is worth noting. some experimenting with tmpl in Win8 JS apps(not web apps)  is raising security prompts. not sure if it is worth investigating or not. just fyi
[10:35:52] <borismoore> any idea what it is related to in tmpl?
[10:36:14] <rworth> chrisBannon: have you tried jsRender? ;)
[10:36:18] <borismoore> or is is some ajax calls or stuff outside tmpl?
[10:36:38] <rworth> any other updates?
[10:37:09] <brado23> nope
[10:37:19] <borismoore> me neither
[10:38:12] <rworth> thanks everyone
[10:38:20] <borismoore> thx
[10:38:22] <brado23> cya
[10:38:23] <rworth> see (many of) you this weekend :)
[10:38:40] <brado23> better bandwidth than IRC
[10:38:48] <chrisBannon> borismoore, I will email you details
[10:38:56] <borismoore> ok thx
