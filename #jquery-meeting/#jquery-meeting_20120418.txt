[09:25:24] <gnarf> Anyone around?
[09:25:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: kborchers jzaefferer
[09:25:47] <kborchers> i am but don't think anyone else is
[09:26:34] <gnarf> kborchers: thats cool
[09:26:43] <gnarf> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArIM4UVbwE-3dFg1T0k4VlE1bF82Nm9tbW90cVNxN0E#gid=14
[09:27:12] <gnarf> I don't know there is anything new to report on any of this
[09:27:30] <gnarf> lindstroem has been pinging me about the split effects pull
[09:27:38] <kborchers> saw that
[09:27:42] <gnarf> i want to do whatevers needed to land it
[09:27:58] <gnarf> so scott_gonzalez - let me know when you get a minute what I need to do to get that landed
[09:28:44] <kborchers> for docs
[09:28:55] <kborchers> i made updates to the mediawiki2xml script
[09:29:03] <kborchers> it's probably about as good as it's going to get
[09:29:16] <kborchers> everything else will have to be done by hand but it covers a good amount
[09:29:34] <gnarf> cool
[09:29:37] <kborchers> Menu is close
[09:29:43] <kborchers> doing some a11y stuff
[09:29:47] <kborchers> writing tests
[09:29:50] <gnarf> we actually are pretty close to having a staging for new docs
[09:29:57] <kborchers> simulate is making me angry
[09:29:59] <gnarf> the multi-site wordpress is up and running
[09:30:05] <gnarf> and if you fake out your /etc/hosts you can see it
[09:30:18] <kborchers> gnarf: nice
[09:30:33] <gnarf> I'm not sure what other work needs to be done in there, but we need to keep a log
[09:31:09] <gnarf> I know we want a machine with node, that can connect to the MySQL on the wp box
[09:31:36] <gnarf> i need someone to explain that process to me
[09:31:42] <gnarf> and i can help model it
[09:32:19] <nacin> gnarf: the machine with node won't need to connect to MySQLâ€¦ ideally node-wordpress will use WP's XML-RPC api over HTTP.
[09:32:23] <gnarf> I still haven't gotten a chance to look at our effects failure
[09:32:36] <nacin> gnarf: koopersmith will be helping out scott_gonzalez I believe
[09:32:40] <gnarf> nacin: kickass
[09:32:47] <gnarf> nacin: that sounds even better
[09:32:50] <koopersmith> what nacin said :)
[09:32:54] <gnarf> avoids me having to setup firewalls
[09:33:47] <gnarf> I wish scott_gonzalez were here, but I'm sure he can update us in -dev on these things when he returns
[09:34:10] <gnarf> koopersmith / nacin - btw - #jqueryui-dev exists as well
[09:34:14] <gnarf> we have too many channels
[09:34:16] <gnarf> ?channels
[09:34:17] <bot-t1> For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev ; Meetings held in#jquery-meeting
[09:34:20] <nacin> yep, I am also there.
[09:34:37] <nacin> idling in -dev, ui-dev and -meeting.
[09:34:46] <koopersmith> gnarf: likewise. we worked out a concatenation bug in there yesterday, actually.
[09:36:05] <gnarf> anyone have anything else for this "meeting" ?
[09:40:59] <gnarf> see ya in -dev
