[14:01:57] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:02:10] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, kristyjy, nashvail
[14:02:17] <kristy> hello
[14:02:43] <nashvail> Hey!
[14:03:32] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:03:36] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:04:43] <sfrisk> I've pulled in the Linting and the grrunt-watch variable changes stuff
[14:05:23] <nashvail> üëç
[14:05:24] <sfrisk> I was going to pull in images, but it breaks right now when rebased into master after some of the naming convention changes that occured with the jsass work
[14:07:45] <sfrisk> hopefully that will get updated soon
[14:08:05] <sfrisk> kristyjy: I know you switched jobs this week - any chance you got table work done
[14:08:48] <kristyjy> Yeah I'm really sorry I've been failing so much lately the job switching / vacation has messed me up pretty bad
[14:09:15] <kristyjy> I'm going to make sure I get to tables this week
[14:09:19] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy its tough times
[14:09:39] <geekman-rohit> I can try to help this weekend
[14:09:42] <geekman-rohit> with tables
[14:10:15] <kristyjy> cool I'll try to get at least something on the repo before then and then maybe we can talk about how we can share it a bit
[14:11:40] <sfrisk> okay
[14:11:40] <geekman-rohit> sure
[14:11:44] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:11:54] <geekman-rohit> I'l ping you on weekend if I survive the week
[14:12:00] <geekman-rohit> with some energy left
[14:12:06] <kristyjy> lol I hear you :D
[14:12:37] <sfrisk> Looks like we're still waiting for updates in input styling
[14:12:50] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk who was doing it?
[14:12:57] <nashvail> Guys I need your thoughts on something
[14:12:58] <sfrisk> nashvail
[14:13:05] <sfrisk> what's up, nashvail?
[14:13:24] <nashvail> So before styling something I am going through these designs to have a solid UI guide first
[14:14:10] <nashvail> We can go with something skeuomorphic like this https://dribbble.com/shots/98897-Chutzpah-UI-Design-Kit-free-button-resource
[14:14:16] <nashvail> excuse the spelling
[14:14:28] <nashvail> OR with something like https://dribbble.com/shots/2547495-UI-Kit-in-the-works
[14:14:35] <nashvail> or this https://dribbble.com/shots/2310281-Moovers-UI-Kit
[14:14:52] <sfrisk> I like the idea of having some sort of design document
[14:14:52] <nashvail> I like the rounded buttons in the second one
[14:15:16] <nashvail> different from Bootstrap and Foundation and others
[14:15:22] <sfrisk> we had been leaning visually to something similar to material design, but it's own thing
[14:15:34] <sfrisk> that was some of the goal behind the button design
[14:15:48] <nashvail> Ahh yes, noticed that the shadows and stuff
[14:15:49] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/master/demos/buttons.html
[14:16:25] <nashvail> Is there any default font we are using ?
[14:16:54] <geekman-rohit> also accessibility over aesthetics
[14:17:09] <geekman-rohit> wherever there has to be a tradeoff
[14:17:16] <geekman-rohit> dark and bold colors may not always look that great
[14:17:22] <geekman-rohit> but they are easy to read
[14:17:37] <nashvail> totally, makes sense
[14:17:47] <geekman-rohit> I have no opinions on colors/aesthetics
[14:17:55] <geekman-rohit> as long as we follow accessibility standards
[14:18:00] <sfrisk> I think it's in typography stuff, nashvail
[14:18:01] <sfrisk> checking
[14:19:17] <nashvail> I also like how the card, shadows and buttons look here in this image
[14:19:32] <nashvail> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/QhhGaXZF/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-26%20at%207.33.58%20AM.png
[14:19:51] <sfrisk> those look nice
[14:19:51] <arschmitz_> sorry all irc was lieing saying i was connected when i was not
[14:21:33] <nashvail> yes, and they also are kind of in line with material design
[14:21:34] <nashvail> so
[14:22:06] <sfrisk> we do want to keep this so it can be easily modified to match personal branding, but I think having a clear idea of what our design is, would be really good
[14:23:07] <geekman-rohit> and the base styling has to bee simple meaningful and light
[14:23:41] <geekman-rohit> we can have multiple themes that build on it
[14:23:43] <geekman-rohit> later
[14:23:50] <nashvail> The developers using Chassis will also be able to modify the default font right ?
[14:24:06] <geekman-rohit> I am personally happy with the current styling so far
[14:24:15] <geekman-rohit> nashvail, yes
[14:24:19] <geekman-rohit> it will be a variable
[14:24:30] <sfrisk> yeah, we have some fonts set in variables
[14:24:45] <sfrisk> the goal is to make it super easy to adjust/tweak things as needed
[14:24:45] <nashvail> geekman-rohit but so far we only have the buttons styled right?
[14:24:58] <geekman-rohit> true
[14:25:00] <sfrisk> buttons, basic typography, and tables are mostly styled
[14:25:04] <sfrisk> we were just switching them to classes
[14:25:22] <geekman-rohit> that leaves forms in the major styling needed first phase
[14:26:47] <nashvail> So are we going to continue with the current style or maybe try some new variations ?
[14:27:14] <sfrisk> we would like to try and continue with the current feel, although if we want to go and rethink designs, I'm okay with that
[14:27:24] <sfrisk> we probably should have come up with a design document first - but we didn't do that
[14:27:39] <nashvail> Never too late
[14:29:03] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:29:10] <sfrisk> So maybe make that a focus for the next week or two?
[14:29:14] <sfrisk> working on a design document
[14:29:25] <sfrisk> take what components we have now styled, and work on a style guide
[14:29:53] <nashvail> If needed I am allowed to play around with the current button styles too ?
[14:30:26] <sfrisk> sure, as long as in the end everything is consistent feel with each other
[14:30:43] <sfrisk> the buttons in there were mostly to have us have a starting point
[14:30:46] <nashvail> yup absolutely
[14:30:49] <sfrisk> we still need to cover icon buttons and stuff
[14:32:27] <nashvail> the font on the buttons is Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
[14:33:06] <nashvail> we're going to stick with these or like use free ones like Lato, Source Sans Pro, Open Sans e.t.c
[14:33:06] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:33:17] <sfrisk> there is a serif font variable that is dragged from
[14:33:30] <sfrisk> I really like Open Sans personally
[14:33:54] <nashvail> Me too üòÉ
[14:35:07] <sfrisk> Okay, so do we want to start on that document for the next two weeks, figure out visuals for basic typography, buttons, inputs/labels
[14:35:34] <nashvail> ‚úã
[14:36:07] <sfrisk> something we could work off of, so when people are working separately, we all have an idea for what we're designing for
[14:36:14] <sfrisk> if we already have a PSD or something we can work off of
[14:36:41] <nashvail> I am on Sketch btw
[14:37:04] <sfrisk> I use sketch as well
[14:37:13] <sfrisk> ALL the programs on my computer
[14:37:35] <nashvail> I don't have PS, we can put designs on http://feedbag.io/
[14:37:50] <sfrisk> ok
[14:38:02] <nashvail> or dropbox, Dropbox also has this commenting feature
[14:39:05] <sfrisk> how do you like feedbag?
[14:39:53] <sfrisk> I've used https://www.invisionapp.com/ in the past
[14:39:58] <sfrisk> for doing visual prototyping
[14:40:14] <nashvail> It's good, you can put in different versions of designs and then people can comment on them. But I think dropbox provides more reliable storage and sharing
[14:40:20] <nashvail> InVision is great as well
[14:40:26] <nashvail> Is it paid ?
[14:40:30] <nashvail> invision
[14:40:49] <sfrisk> I think you might be able to use it free?
[14:40:58] <sfrisk> I think it's private stuff that you might have to pay for
[14:41:47] <nashvail> the CTA button says GET STARTED - FREE FOREVER!
[14:41:56] <nashvail> so yeah
[14:43:28] <sfrisk> yay!
[14:43:32] <sfrisk> okay invision and sketch then?
[14:43:50] <nashvail> Yus!
[14:44:09] <sfrisk> Let's create an issue for this, and what components we're going to create
[14:44:54] <nashvail> ok
[14:45:38] <sfrisk> okay, so lets' get the discussion going there after this meeting
[14:46:02] <nashvail> üëç
[14:46:15] <sfrisk> I have to get back to work right now, but that can be what we work on this week
[14:47:47] <nashvail> Sounds good
[14:48:02] <sfrisk> okay, see everyone next week then/ on the issue
[14:48:12] <sfrisk> nashvail, if you can, do you want to get the issue going?
[14:48:17] <sfrisk> I'll comment on it once I have some free time
[14:48:32] <nashvail> Yes sure.
[14:48:45] <sfrisk> awesome, thanks!
[14:48:53] <sfrisk> and see everyone next week!
