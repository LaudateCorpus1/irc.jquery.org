[12:01:08] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> Need to detect `mouseup` outside of window (https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/279) has been fixed.
[12:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/297
[12:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> This week there was some discussion about multi-pointer gestures and `touch-action`.
[12:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/29
[12:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> This issue is specifically about pinch-zoom because Edge is already shipping that.
[12:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> So Chrome wants to implement it since it's already been shipped.
[12:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> This recently came up as a bug in jQuery UI: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14993
[12:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what sparked this discussion again.
[12:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> There's a Pointer Events Hackathon on the 26th and 27th.
[12:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> The browser vendors that are implementing Pointer Events are meeting at Microsoft to go over the implementations.
[12:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be there representing jQuery and PEP.
[12:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> The main goals are:
[12:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> Identify implementation differences
[12:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> Determine if the spec needs to change for any compat issues
[12:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Understand compat implications of removing hit testing while down
[12:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> Improve test coverage as needed
[12:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone has anything specific they'd like me to bring up during that meeting, just let me know by the 26th.
[12:13:46] <bethge> Sorry, totally forgot about the meeting. It is kind of going crazy at work right now, sorry.
[12:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, bethge
[12:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> That was everything I had for today.
[12:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> Did you have anything to discuss today?
[12:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
