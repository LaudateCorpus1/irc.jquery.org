[08:57:44] <DaveMethvin> testing 123
[08:57:52] <rwaldron> 8===D
[09:01:24] <DaveMethvin> Lets do that meeting thang!
[09:01:49] <DaveMethvin> not too much on the agenda today, unless someone wants to add more
[09:02:36] <timmywil> so we're not just adding all of the features/bugs to the tracker
[09:02:38] <timmywil> ?
[09:02:42] <timmywil> fine with me
[09:02:47] <jaubourg> sorry late
[09:02:56] <DaveMethvin> you mean all the ones in the sheet? I cherry picked some that looked good
[09:02:58] <timmywil> but we should go through the list and see which ones we do want to add
[09:03:03] <timmywil> ok
[09:03:08] <DaveMethvin> that was last week's assignment :P
[09:03:14] <timmywil> ah, right
[09:03:20] <jaubourg> yeah, and I didn't get time to do my part :/
[09:03:20] <rwaldron> shit
[09:03:20] <timmywil> ooooops
[09:03:21] <DaveMethvin> but yeah if you see any that didn't get done feel free to add
[09:03:25] <rwaldron> somehow I missed that completely
[09:03:33] <timmywil> i missed last week's meeting :(
[09:03:57] <jaubourg> and the meeting missed you timmy
[09:04:02] <jaubourg> GROUPHUG!!!!
[09:04:06] <rwaldron> :)
[09:04:11] <DaveMethvin> i love youse guys
[09:04:30] * jaubourg hides
[09:04:32] <DaveMethvin> please do go through and see if there are any that need to be added, i just didn't see much
[09:04:32] <rwaldron> I feel like I'm in "feature proposal overload hell"
[09:04:51] <DaveMethvin> exactly, and even beyond that it's mostly "add this plugin into core"
[09:05:02] <DaveMethvin> so i didn't think that was even worth adding tix for it
[09:05:07] <ajpiano> i'm gonna lobby pretty hard for serializeObject
[09:05:15] <ajpiano> for future reference
[09:05:24] <rwaldron> hilarious
[09:05:35] <DaveMethvin> obtw ajpiano thanks for adding the ticket-related ones to 1.8-discuss
[09:05:38] <rwaldron> "Some kind of animation interface!!"
[09:05:56] <ajpiano> it's really a pita that you can't get a form to an object without including a plugin, and ben's impl is tiny
[09:05:57] <jaubourg> well, to be fair, while other libs have modules and make it easy to integrate functionalities as modules, the jQuery dichotomy of core/official plugin/not-so-official plugin/some random plugin/a bad plugin is getting a bit confusing to people methinks
[09:06:27] <DaveMethvin> i think some of the PROCESS ones i marked will be helped by our  new plugins site
[09:06:31] <rwaldron> +1 to ajpiano
[09:06:43] <DaveMethvin> the other issue that came up frequently was "make me a download builder"
[09:06:53] <DaveMethvin> sorry, "sudo make me a download builder"
[09:06:56] <ajpiano> especially with single page apps where when you're doing form-y things, you rarely need a querystring, all you want is an object.
[09:07:08] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: yeah, for sure... that was a long request :p
[09:07:27] <timmywil> isn't that easy to do without adding a method to core?
[09:07:30] <DaveMethvin> and if we added all these plugins into core then yes we'd need a download builder so people could strip them out
[09:07:47] <rwaldron> ahahahaha
[09:07:47] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I don't see the serializeObject feature in the 1.8 list. you have a ticket number?
[09:08:04] <ajpiano> kswedberg: i don't think there is one
[09:08:11] <DaveMethvin> i thought there was a ticket for serializeObject but if not feel free to add one
[09:08:15] <jaubourg> well, has anybody some data on how fat Dojo or YUI can get for your standard site?
[09:08:21] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: me too, i couldn't find it
[09:08:25] <rwaldron> jaubourg effing huge
[09:08:30] <ajpiano> timmywil: of course it is, but it's *really* common
[09:08:32] <DaveMethvin> dojo is about 100KB compressed, we are about 92KB
[09:08:33] <jaubourg> it seems to me that nobody is actually looking at the numbers
[09:08:34] <DaveMethvin> not gzip
[09:08:40] <ajpiano> and in 2011, a hell of a lot more useful than serializeArray
[09:08:59] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin when you start loading in Dojo's "stuff"
[09:09:01] <rwaldron> it grows
[09:09:04] <jaubourg> Dave: yeah, but what Dojo? I mean, with which modules? only the same as what we have in core?
[09:09:07] <kswedberg> ajpiano: +1. file the ticket! :D
[09:09:11] <rwaldron> jQuery is one-stop-shop
[09:09:15] <DaveMethvin> not counting dijit stuff
[09:09:24] <timmywil> but not usually separate from submitting with ajax, right? so perhaps it should stay with that
[09:09:29] <rwaldron> you pay that 32kb compressed/gzipped cost once
[09:09:40] <ajpiano> timmywil: no, that's the point
[09:09:59] <ajpiano> it often is separate from submitting with ajax
[09:10:03] <timmywil> if we add that, wouldn't that make a bigger case for ajaxSubmit?
[09:10:13] <ajpiano> like, if you're doing an app where the whole things in localstorage
[09:10:33] <ajpiano> timmywil: it also considerably improves makes the lives of people who want to submit a form via ajax, but also want to augment it with some properties
[09:10:39] <rwaldron> I'm glad "Add JSON.stringify for IE 6/7" hasnt made it to the trac list
[09:10:44] <jaubourg> well, I'd be glad if we could just detach effects and ajax from core
[09:10:51] <jaubourg> and turn them into official plugins
[09:11:04] <ajpiano> var formdata = $("#form").serializeObject(); formdata.somethingelse = "baz";
[09:11:06] <DaveMethvin> if there's a serializeObject, shouldn't there be a deserializeObject too?
[09:11:09] * DaveMethvin runs away
[09:11:12] * jaubourg spanks
[09:11:14] <timmywil> ok, but you probably also created some interface for interacting with localStorage, which could often mean custom objects that include more than just name: value
[09:11:16] <ajpiano> timmywil: ajaxSubmit is considerably more complex
[09:11:30] <ajpiano> than just giving people the form as an object
[09:12:07] <DaveMethvin> well as long as it is less than 10 bytes gzip i am okay with it
[09:12:13] <DaveMethvin> evil grin
[09:12:24] <jaubourg> ajpiano: funny thing, one of my coworker @ creative-area did the exact opposite: http://labs.creative-area.net/jquery.formautofill/
[09:12:56] <DaveMethvin> that's something i do think we should consider, even if we all like a feature if the impl turns out to be big we may need to trim or reject it in the worst case
[09:13:29] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: file a 1.8-discuss to add that to core ... NO JUST KIDDING
[09:13:52] <jaubourg> we lack a sane plugin ecosystem where this kind of stuff could be tackled and publicized easily
[09:13:53] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin deserializeObject is param, no?
[09:14:22] <DaveMethvin> take an object and stuff its properties into a corresponding form ... er somehow
[09:14:31] <rwaldron> (not directly, but close-ish)
[09:14:35] <rwaldron> oh, i see... nvm
[09:14:40] <jaubourg> heh
[09:14:48] <timmywil> there's no deserializeArray tho
[09:14:50] <timmywil> ew
[09:14:51] <DaveMethvin> anyway, just to cover the other issues, i think everyone saw that  the Closure Compiler work is progressing
[09:15:17] <jaubourg> yep, and we already have changes that'll make jQuery size grow for anyone that doesn't use Closure :/
[09:15:25] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately yes
[09:15:28] <jaubourg> just as predicted
[09:15:47] <rwaldron> i want to close all of these
[09:15:53] <timmywil> var Sizzle = function( selector ) { return document.getElementById( selector ); };
[09:16:04] <DaveMethvin> done
[09:16:10] <jaubourg> I'd be more interested in discussing the decoupling stuff you opened for discussion Dave ;)
[09:16:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah, to what extent do we need to gold plate the decoupling stuff?
[09:16:37] <jaubourg> for instance, ajax uses event internally with global events too
[09:16:40] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm trying to be optimistic, but it looks like jQuery source is gonna get fat
[09:16:54] <DaveMethvin> for example, there is already a way to replace Sizzle if you just replace the linkages
[09:16:57] <rwaldron> obviously, who cares about the size of the source
[09:17:07] <rwaldron> but for maintenance purposes...
[09:17:12] <rwaldron> it's getting WET
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> can we just put some  //===== cut here ==== comments around Sizzle and the linkages and add some docs on what to do?
[09:17:27] <jaubourg> rwaldron: yes, it's a new set of contraints
[09:17:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's more complicated than that
[09:17:59] <timmywil> but the major selector libraries have already taken care of coupling their own libraries
[09:18:04] <jaubourg> well, we could just use jQuery.selectorEngine internally and people would just override it :P
[09:18:19] <rwaldron> auto-vendor-prefix is interesting
[09:18:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's kind of the gold plated solution
[09:18:22] <jaubourg> (yeah, more public stuff to break!!!)
[09:18:34] <rwaldron> but really
[09:18:57] <rwaldron> isnt the reason jQuery is awesome because I can just write plugins and duck punch features
[09:19:02] <DaveMethvin> but anyway the same goes for animations, should/can we just document that you can cut out that chunk if you avoid calling all these apis?
[09:19:06] <rwaldron> we should develop all this shit
[09:19:13] <rwaldron> and then be like "SEE??"
[09:19:18] <rwaldron> Look how big you all made it
[09:19:26] <rwaldron> stop complaining about 32kb
[09:19:45] <rwaldron> "Change the way jQuery does scope?"
[09:19:48] <rwaldron> FFS
[09:19:58] <DaveMethvin> i have a blog post started about that but am not sure the tone is "constructive" :) I figured i'd pass it by ajpiano
[09:20:12] <rwaldron> link?
[09:20:14] <ajpiano> :)
[09:20:20] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: make a backup first... :P
[09:20:21] * jaubourg hides
[09:20:22] <rwaldron> let me read it before ajpiano makes it nice
[09:20:35] * jaubourg hugs ajpiano
[09:20:45] <jaubourg> ;)
[09:20:49] <DaveMethvin> now that we've taken out the emails i wanted to show everyone the suggestion box and how hypocritical the community seems to be about size/feature tradeoff
[09:20:55] <rwaldron> "cross-browser DOMNodeInserted/Removed" holy shit. please support a DEPRECATED spec.
[09:21:23] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm with you 100%
[09:21:30] <rwaldron> This post needs to happen
[09:21:42] <rwaldron> "CSS-like selectors on event namespaces"
[09:21:50] <DaveMethvin> draft shared, again it's very rough and unfinished at this point
[09:21:54] <rwaldron> "Do amazing iframe stuff that probably isn't allowed by the security model"
[09:21:56] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: well, I certainly hope no-one expects more feature with less code?
[09:22:00] <rwaldron> your summaries are brilliant
[09:22:00] <DaveMethvin> shared to your jquey-bugs-team addys
[09:22:45] <timmywil> we should do a google hangout sometime
[09:22:47] <DaveMethvin> well that's the challenge, even the act of including a cookie plugin is too much work
[09:23:10] <jaubourg> Dave: I didn't quite like the snark about the download/modular system... all people are not asking for the exact same thing here, some of them are actually asking for a size trimmer a-la Closure which is the effort we're apparently making (did I say foolishly already?)
[09:23:24] <jaubourg> other than that, yeah, some of these suggestions are gold
[09:23:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah that can be cleaned up
[09:23:40] <DaveMethvin> and will be before we publish the link
[09:23:44] <rwaldron> this has to be published
[09:23:52] <rwaldron> it's imperative
[09:24:11] <jaubourg> we'll be accused of making fun of our users again :P
[09:24:17] <DaveMethvin> but when you look at the fact that companies the size of Apple are using uncompressed/uncombined files on their HOME PAGE,  how serious are developers
[09:24:20] <jaubourg> "those jQuery snobs"
[09:24:21] <DaveMethvin> about code size?
[09:24:24] <rwaldron> jaubourg they deserve it
[09:24:35] <DaveMethvin> i'm not making fun of anyone
[09:24:39] <rwaldron> and 26.6 million sites aren't going to forgo the convenience
[09:24:54] <DaveMethvin> i am just saying that before complaining about 32KB and one file, take a look at your 400KB and 15 files
[09:24:59] <DaveMethvin> and figure out how to reduce it
[09:25:01] <rwaldron> has anyone paid attention to that "jQuery in Parts" aka "jquip" project?
[09:25:11] <rwaldron> it's getting bigger
[09:25:15] <mikesherov> rwaldron, yes
[09:25:19] <rwaldron> as he realizes he broke jQuery
[09:25:23] <rwaldron> and is a retard
[09:25:24] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i like the sentiment... otoh, i don't know if it's worth blogging about
[09:25:25] <addyosmani> rwaldron: it saddens me some people are seriously using that in production :/
[09:25:39] <rwaldron> addyosmani they will learn a lesson
[09:25:42] <rwaldron> i dont feel bad
[09:25:42] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I don't think we need to emphasize that it's hypocritical to suggest features when we want to reduce size
[09:25:46] <rwaldron> they're idiots
[09:25:46] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: when you have so many users, it's a given that they're not all on the same page with each other
[09:25:46] <mikesherov> addyosmani: it doesn't make me sad, it makes me happy
[09:25:56] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: Minus Julian's comment about the snark on modular approaches, I think the overall post looks strong.
[09:25:58] <mikesherov> those same people will realize what's missing
[09:26:04] <ajpiano> it's not like the same person is saying "hey, add crazy feature X AND also make the library smaller'
[09:26:05] <jaubourg> ajpiano: +1
[09:26:11] <timmywil> we asked people to propse features with a feature proposal form
[09:26:12] <DaveMethvin> anyway, like i said if you see any gems in the suggestion box please do pull them out and make a ticket
[09:26:23] <ajpiano> ?11002
[09:26:25] <bot-t> [#11002] Add serializeObject method to core (new feature) - http://jqbug.com/11002
[09:26:28] <ajpiano> :D
[09:26:43] <addyosmani> *whoever* could have suggested that one? :p
[09:26:44] <jaubourg> damn sucky google account mess
[09:26:48] <DaveMethvin> em, where's that WONTFIX button again? :P
[09:27:05] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i'm largely against crazy new features, we just have to be wary of saying "well, it's a new feature, and all new features are bad and bloated, so we're not gonna do it
[09:27:09] <ajpiano> "
[09:27:09] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: can't access the doc, since j@ubourg.net is not my google account :P
[09:27:17] <mikesherov> so, sorry I'm late, did I miss out on any discussion on vendor prefix detection?
[09:27:19] <timmywil> if we express the hypocrisy, doesn't that kind of make us hypocrits for giving people a form to request features?
[09:27:31] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: thanks :)
[09:27:34] <timmywil> of course people will put in features
[09:27:35] <ajpiano> timmywil: agreed w/ that
[09:27:51] <mikesherov> scumbag jquery: asks for feature ideas, complains about them
[09:27:52] <timmywil> they don't HAVE to be concerned with size like we do
[09:27:58] <ajpiano> i like the request that someone submitted that not only can users submit features, that users VOTE on the new features
[09:27:58] <timmywil> and we can reject anything that is too big
[09:28:03] <DaveMethvin> actually the form was not titled features timmywil
[09:28:04] <ajpiano> and things get developed by ... popularity
[09:28:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: every form in the past was presented that way even if this one was not
[09:28:20] <mikesherov> ajpiano: isn't that mob rule?
[09:28:23] <rwaldron> I have been including serializeObject in every client project since 2009
[09:28:28] <ajpiano> mikesherov: yep
[09:28:28] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:28:30] <ajpiano> rwaldron: exactly
[09:28:34] <DaveMethvin> and the blog post made it clear we didn't want pony/unicorn suggestions
[09:28:52] <ajpiano> that's why i'm differentiating it from us... adding a text editor
[09:28:55] <DaveMethvin> at least I thought it did
[09:29:11] <timmywil> i still don't think that matters.  I don't care that people requested a bunch of features because it's just brainstorming
[09:29:13] <DaveMethvin> jQuery-vim must be written!
[09:29:24] <ajpiano> i agree with you timmywil
[09:29:34] <ajpiano> i don't think we should be complaining about the stuff that streamed in in the process
[09:29:34] <DaveMethvin> i don't think "add this plugin to core" is brainstorming
[09:29:54] <mikesherov> did we talk about this:
[09:30:01] <DaveMethvin> we did get a couple of good things in there
[09:30:01] <mikesherov> ?10679
[09:30:03] <bot-t> [#10679] CSS3 vendor prefix support (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/10679
[09:30:06] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:30:07] <rwaldron> something to consider...
[09:30:27] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we can't criticize people for filling out our form with what they wanted
[09:30:27] <DaveMethvin> several who wanted that and it is clear why
[09:30:29] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i think the point of us doing it is that at least we aren't coming up with new features that no one wants
[09:30:33] <ajpiano> like.. jQuery.sub
[09:30:36] <ajpiano> for instanace
[09:30:41] <rwaldron> Henry Ford once said "if I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have told me 'A faster horse'"
[09:30:43] <DaveMethvin> YOU SAID THE WORD
[09:30:51] <mikesherov> rwaldron: exactly!
[09:30:53] <DaveMethvin> exactly, i think there's a Jobs comment
[09:30:55] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we reserve the right to say 'no', so let's move on
[09:30:59] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:31:09] <rwaldron> every jQuery 1.foo feature request we've publicized has been full of garbage
[09:31:18] <rwaldron> most of which we end up not using
[09:31:26] <rwaldron> (seriously, stop lying to ourselves)
[09:31:34] <DaveMethvin> so put any things  you think need discussion on the 1.8-discuss list
[09:31:36] <rwaldron> we end up adding features that make sense
[09:31:45] <DaveMethvin> if its just a bug you're going to fix it doesn't need disucssion
[09:31:45] <rwaldron> that are the result of experience
[09:31:54] <DaveMethvin> unless it's like +200 to fix  :P
[09:32:00] <rwaldron> so i dont think it's wrong to publish tat
[09:32:02] <rwaldron> that*
[09:32:03] <ajpiano> exactly, it's just a clearinghouse for us to get a sense of what people want... if someone else hadn't submitted serializeObject, i would haev done it anyway
[09:32:18] <timmywil> I don't think we should publish the first 3 paragraphs
[09:32:26] <mikesherov> is the discussion here whether or not we have to listen to the suggestions?
[09:32:28] <ajpiano> a more interesting blog post would be one written from the perspective of 5 years down the line
[09:32:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm going to be removing a few things from the current 1.8 discuss
[09:32:33] <rwaldron> things i know are pointless
[09:32:38] <DaveMethvin> ok if it will stop discussion on it i have no plans to publish that
[09:32:38] <rwaldron> eg. classListt
[09:32:45] <timmywil> we should thank people for filling out our form, no matter what they put in it
[09:32:53] <ajpiano> "Remember when people thought that 20kb was the perfect size, but 30kb was way too big?"
[09:33:00] <mikesherov> @timmywil: +1
[09:33:01] <DaveMethvin> but should we put the list out for public review? if so,  how?
[09:33:26] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: we can put it out as a footnote in the release post
[09:33:34] <DaveMethvin> the 1.8 post?
[09:33:41] <ajpiano> like, here's what happened for 1.8... btw, here's everything that was suggested for 1.8
[09:33:52] <ajpiano> "in case you're curious what we accepted and rejected"
[09:33:56] <DaveMethvin> but the two have almost no relation :P
[09:34:01] <ajpiano> naw
[09:34:06] <ajpiano> then it's not like we're judging the quality of the submissions
[09:34:08] <jaubourg> ajpiano: that's how the Java bug parade worked... programming by contract happened to climb second into the issues by vote... and they introduced asserts... you can imagine how unhappy people were (I personally stopped working in Java at that point). I think that, if you reserve the right to ignore votes, then you shouldn't have them in the first place... it can only damage projet/users communication in the end.
[09:34:08] <jaubourg> Counter-intuitive but already happened :/
[09:34:23] <ajpiano> it actually reinforces the message you want to send
[09:34:35] <ajpiano> so people can see what types of suggestions and features actually make it in
[09:34:51] <ajpiano> and know that hey guess what, maybe i *WONT'* submit the cookie plugin for 1.9, 2.0, and 2.1
[09:35:14] <mikesherov> look, if people vote, and you do something else anyway, the voting will quickly become unimportant
[09:35:28] <DaveMethvin> the "let me check boxes to decide what to include" was a very popular suggestion
[09:35:31] <jaubourg> ajpiano: wrong, they will submit it until the end of days, in the slim chance it'll get picked up out of exhaustion on the team part
[09:35:47] <DaveMethvin> if we're just going by votes then it would be in 1.8 ... somehow
[09:35:50] <ajpiano> i don't think we're *ever* planning to have a public vote on what features actually get included
[09:35:59] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I think checking boxes make sense... even if it breaks plugins
[09:36:03] <ajpiano> that would be insane
[09:36:09] <mikesherov> I mean, we're acting as if the community is one person
[09:36:15] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:36:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i thought we went by OUR votes
[09:36:19] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:36:22] <jaubourg> mikesherov: +1
[09:36:30] <rwaldron> so the feature gets added 100 times
[09:36:36] <DaveMethvin> i think the point is that a representative democracy is better than a direct one :D
[09:36:43] <DaveMethvin> where we are representatives
[09:36:43] <mikesherov> Like, if you want modular jQuery, you can't use plugins
[09:36:44] <rwaldron> it qualifies to be voted on by us
[09:36:47] <timmywil> I agree that an explanation for why something is rejected is great (and size is a perfectly valid reason).  People will understand that not everything will make it in (even if a lot of people like it).
[09:36:47] <jaubourg> all hail DaveMethvin !
[09:36:51] <jaubourg> ahem
[09:36:53] * jaubourg hides
[09:36:59] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin right
[09:37:13] <ajpiano> well, there's a difference between a "public vote" where the members of the bugs team vote in a publicly visible way - and a vote where everyone in the public is eligible to have an equally weighted opinion
[09:37:18] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:37:22] <DaveMethvin> that's what i meant
[09:37:25] <mikesherov> Sure, but in representative democracy, people vote on the decision makers, not the decisions to make
[09:37:25] <ajpiano> the former is what we do, the latter would be literally nuts
[09:37:32] <timmywil> agreed
[09:37:38] <mikesherov> so unless you suggest we elect contributors, it's a false analogy
[09:37:43] <rwaldron> but I can honestly say, I will -1 "modular, buildable jQuery" forever
[09:37:44] <timmywil> w/ aj
[09:37:51] <rwaldron> jQuery is a baseline
[09:37:55] <rwaldron> build on top
[09:37:56] <jaubourg> it's a benevolent dictatorship at best
[09:37:58] <DaveMethvin> ok so we, the representatives of all that is sane, should vote on these tickets this week
[09:38:02] <mikesherov> rwaldron, MAYBE
[09:38:03] <jaubourg> with too many dictators already :P
[09:38:07] <mikesherov> is effects really a base?
[09:38:22] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i'm down with that
[09:38:29] <jaubourg> mikesherov: used to be, is not anymore with css features
[09:38:32] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov:  that is the gist of the one ticket i added
[09:38:51] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin, which one?
[09:38:56] <rwaldron> mikesherov i think it's used so much that it is
[09:38:57] <DaveMethvin> i think that sizzle/ajax/effects could be removed or stubbed without too much work
[09:38:58] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i would just say that "it's a plugin already" isn't a reason to reject things out of hand ... especially if most of the time when we kick back something, we say "hey, do it as a plugin first, and see if it's popular"
[09:39:02] <rwaldron> show/hide?
[09:39:10] <timmywil> mikesherov: see the notes http://goo.gl/lhKlz
[09:39:13] <DaveMethvin> if the user understands that they cannot call certain apis
[09:39:37] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: ajax is used to execute script synchronously when setting html
[09:39:44] <jaubourg> sad but true
[09:39:54] <jaubourg> that's the worst possible hard dependency we have
[09:40:03] <DaveMethvin> well yes there might need to be some refactoring, that would potentially make the code bigger
[09:40:10] <DaveMethvin> or hell we say "no script in html()"
[09:40:18] <jaubourg> good luck with that
[09:40:21] <DaveMethvin> the point is we need to document the rules
[09:40:37] <DaveMethvin> and if someone breaks them and complains we say "works with the whole jQuery"
[09:40:47] <mikesherov> Sure, I'm for that
[09:40:59] <mikesherov> those building modular jQuery need to understand that
[09:41:06] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I see that point, yes
[09:41:09] <DaveMethvin> even with Closure Compiler there you'll be able to screw up by calling something like .load()
[09:41:11] <jaubourg> we *could* test if jQuery.ajax is there and throw an exception is it's not in that particular case
[09:41:16] <jaubourg> should do the trick
[09:41:42] <mikesherov> or we can can get serious, and figure out the dependencies, and use a dep manager
[09:41:52] <jaubourg> that's what I think we should do
[09:42:00] <mikesherov> similar to the groundwork laid out for the plugins site
[09:42:03] <DaveMethvin> "figure out the dependencies" is importantt yes
[09:42:08] <mikesherov> we already are planning that having a version number
[09:42:22] <jaubourg> what's the followup on using Closure to extract a dependency graph?
[09:42:23] <timmywil> we all agree on the first step yes
[09:42:28] <mikesherov> make the plugins register what components they need
[09:42:43] <DaveMethvin> i don't know what happened to that question jaubourg
[09:42:59] <DaveMethvin> you know CC has what we need in some internal data structure ... GIMMEE
[09:43:01] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: that would be very very handy
[09:43:06] <timmywil> fyi, Sizzle spiders into almost everything so it is really not very easy to extract
[09:43:12] <DaveMethvin> :(
[09:43:22] <mikesherov> I mean, that's fine if you ask me though
[09:43:27] <timmywil> sizzle-jquery.js is not the only connection
[09:43:32] <jaubourg> timmywil: tell me Sizzle doesn't do some ajax :P
[09:43:38] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:43:40] <mikesherov> there are some parts of jQuery that are baseline: sizzle, core
[09:43:41] <timmywil> haha
[09:43:42] <timmywil> no
[09:43:44] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: if we scracth CC's back by.... letting them dictate how we write code... at the very least, let's get some internal data structures in return
[09:43:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah ajpiano i'm fine with that
[09:44:08] <timmywil> dont' get me wrong, it is POSSIBLE, just not easy
[09:44:11] <mikesherov> I'm fine with conforming to CC standards too
[09:44:12] <DaveMethvin> also fine with having to annotate, that might be easier than changing code
[09:44:19] <mikesherov> it's never been easy
[09:44:25] <timmywil> nwmatcher and slick have plugins when used with jQuery
[09:44:49] <jaubourg> ajpiano: well, it's just that some space saving tricks are a no go with CC but it's not THAT heavy... it's just sad we have to see the size grow in hope that people will embrace a third-party tool
[09:45:15] <DaveMethvin> what i am thinking is that if you said "i swear my code base has no jQuery selectors and just needs qSA/matchesSelector" there should be a stub for that
[09:45:25] <ajpiano> this whole thing just goes to why i think these dicussions will seem so pointless a few years down the line
[09:45:26] <jaubourg> I don't buy this adoption at all but I already made myself clear
[09:45:41] <timmywil> anyway, so to sum up… we are double checking the list for ticket additions, voting, and researching module dependencies.
[09:45:45] <timmywil> right?
[09:45:48] <DaveMethvin> yes indeed
[09:45:49] <mikesherov> I mean, honestly... 20KB vs. 30KB
[09:45:49] <jaubourg> right
[09:45:53] <mikesherov> what is that?
[09:45:59] <ajpiano> mikesherov:it's absurd
[09:46:04] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: er, 10KB?
[09:46:06] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:46:08] <jaubourg> +1 ajpiano, mikesherov
[09:46:09] <ajpiano> it's people finding stratification where none really exists
[09:46:20] <mikesherov> I mean, on my 56KB modem, it's 2 seconds
[09:46:24] <timmywil> it makes a difference in mobile
[09:46:30] <jaubourg> for now
[09:46:34] <DaveMethvin> when you look at the size of the average app, jQuery is tiny though
[09:46:40] <jaubourg> which is a transitory state
[09:46:44] <ajpiano> yep
[09:46:59] <mikesherov> AHHHH, I'm wavering
[09:47:11] <DaveMethvin> i was looking at NYTimes skimmer app, it's like 400KB of javascript and they don't even compress half of it
[09:47:24] <DaveMethvin> so like how serious are ppl about this?
[09:47:51] <jaubourg> they should be
[09:47:54] <rwaldron> they're not
[09:47:57] <rwaldron> jaubourg is right
[09:47:59] <rwaldron> but they're not
[09:48:03] <jaubourg> heh
[09:48:05] <DaveMethvin> imdb.com doesn't combine or compress
[09:48:10] <DaveMethvin> think of the bandwidth they are wasting
[09:48:12] <timmywil> power users are
[09:48:15] <DaveMethvin> and they are a top 50 site!
[09:48:16] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i think that the broad majority of people aren't serious about it all, and the people who are serious about it are VERY SERIOUS ABOUT IT... and then a few other people read those people and are like... whoa, trimming the sounds of jquery is IMPORTANT TO ME TOO
[09:48:25] <rwaldron> timmywil orly? like....
[09:48:25] <mikesherov> It seems like the only rational answer is allow a builder for those who really really want it (the noisy 1%)
[09:48:32] <rwaldron> us?
[09:48:33] <timmywil> rwaldron: you and me
[09:48:35] <rwaldron> yep
[09:48:36] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: yes that is basically it
[09:48:41] <jaubourg> <rwaldron> jaubourg is right <= this will get copy/pasted like crazy
[09:48:47] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[09:48:49] <jaubourg> just saying ;)
[09:48:56] <timmywil> haha
[09:49:00] <Cokegod> since when are top websites good examples?
[09:49:04] <mikesherov> I'd argue the ONLY people who really really want a smaller jQuery are people who know what plugins they can and can't use
[09:49:10] <timmywil> Cokegod: heh, +1
[09:49:11] <rwaldron> bot-t: jaubourg is <rwaldron> jaubourg is right
[09:49:12] <bot-t> rwaldron, Changed "jaubourg".
[09:49:18] <rwaldron> ?jaubourg
[09:49:19] <bot-t> <rwaldron> jaubourg is right
[09:49:19] <DaveMethvin> ok, so any other important stuff?
[09:49:24] <timmywil> alright, i'm hungry
[09:49:27] <ajpiano> Cokegod: it doesn't matter whether they're good examples... those are the websites people are going to :)
[09:49:37] <timmywil> ajpiano: matters to me
[09:49:39] <jaubourg> haha
[09:49:42] <mikesherov> and what our goal should be is reducing dependencies without sacrificing size
[09:49:44] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: go get something to eat
[09:49:46] <DaveMethvin> then it won't matter
[09:49:49] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:49:50] <timmywil> haha
[09:49:53] <timmywil> <3
[09:50:06] <ajpiano> if i spend 4 weeks shaving the size of my js on "customcraftedeggbeaters.com," that doesn't really impact the experience of a lot of people
[09:50:15] <mikesherov> so, newbie here.... next steps are voting on those tickets?
[09:50:34] <jaubourg> yeah, and I need to create some myself
[09:50:40] <jaubourg> too much work and no play...
[09:50:41] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: do you see a voting widget below the main ticket text?
[09:50:51] <DaveMethvin> if not we may need to add some permission
[09:50:55] <timmywil> ajpiano: but I want to learn from the good examples, and knowing that being in the top 50 doesn't necessarily mean good, I can know to ignore the bad and take from the good.
[09:51:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin mikesherov i'll look now
[09:51:09] <mikesherov> no, I do not
[09:51:21] <DaveMethvin> timmywil ajpiano: i have a todo to write an article about this
[09:51:29] <ajpiano> timmywil: most people who consume websites aren't learning how to make websites, they're just consuming them
[09:51:34] <ajpiano> but i hear what you're saying
[09:51:36] <DaveMethvin> basically why combining/compressing is important, don't use jquery-latest etc
[09:51:51] <mikesherov> and there is a time when I can advocate for CSS3 prefix detectors?
[09:51:56] <DaveMethvin> because it's surprising how many sites don't do the simplest thing
[09:51:57] <mikesherov> or just do it during the vote
[09:52:02] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: is it on the voting list?
[09:52:24] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yes
[09:52:44] <rwaldron> mikesherov refresh
[09:52:57] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: did you see the voting widget thing on the 1.8-discuss tickets? sounds like rwaldron may have fixed it
[09:53:05] <rwaldron> what he said
[09:53:12] <mikesherov> don't see it
[09:53:15] <rwaldron> ok
[09:53:19] <DaveMethvin> ok i'm going over to -dev
[09:53:34] <rwaldron> mikesherov try again?
[09:53:55] <mikesherov> still nothing
[09:54:00] <mikesherov> do I need to log out and back in?
[09:54:02] <rwaldron> what the fuck
[09:54:09] <rwaldron> what are you looking at?
[09:54:18] <timmywil> mikesherov: you're looking here? http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&keywords=~1.8-discuss&col=id&col=summary&report=501&order=id&row=description
[09:54:33] <timmywil> yea, back to -dev. thanks all!
[09:54:39] <rwaldron> click on one of the summaries
[09:54:55] <timmywil> setting mode back before i leave
