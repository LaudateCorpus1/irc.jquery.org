[09:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: arschmitz gnarf jperrault kborchers petersendidit rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:00:40] <petersendidit> hey
[09:00:41] <kborchers> yo
[09:00:43] <jperrault> hello
[09:00:43] <arschmitz> hey
[09:00:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[09:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Let's start with button.
[09:01:40] <tj_vantoll> Here, but also in another meeting as well.
[09:02:46] <jzaefferer> I did another review of button today, spend a few hours
[09:03:18] <jzaefferer> button and checkboxradio are looking good, still plenty of nitpicking. controlgroup has a bigger issue, the lack of extensibility
[09:03:20] <rxaviers> hello
[09:03:56] <jzaefferer> also there are no tests for adding new widgets via the items option, which is related to the lack of extensibility
[09:05:20] <jzaefferer> that's all I got there, will review again, and also pay more attention to unit tests, after the next updates from Alex
[09:05:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah ill fix that
[09:06:01] <arschmitz> it should not be complicated to add the extensibility
[09:06:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: did you put anything on the wiki for back compat?
[09:07:15] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: no i have not really addressed any backcompat yet
[09:08:03] <jzaefferer> ok. Putting a draft on the wikiis still the first step
[09:09:21] <jzaefferer> Datepicker?
[09:09:44] <rxaviers> I've rebased datepicker-globalize-1.x on top of fnagal's new PR
[09:09:57] <rxaviers> and I've updated it to use the new Globalize format/parse generators
[09:10:11] <fnagel> Sorry, I'm late
[09:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I assume the new PR is ready for me to do another round of review?
[09:10:17] <fnagel> Yes
[09:10:24] <rxaviers> (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1341)
[09:10:31] <fnagel> Implemented all your comments
[09:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll put that on my list again.
[09:10:43] <fnagel> or added issues to the todo list in the wiki
[09:10:59] <fnagel> rxaviers: thanks, I've seen this
[09:11:01] <fnagel> Looks good
[09:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> One question that came up is whether we should be using `x - 1` for months.
[09:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> So `12 - 1` instead off `11` when doing new Date().
[09:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> Since months start at 0.
[09:12:43] <fnagel> I like it
[09:12:45] <jzaefferer> What's the context of this?
[09:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/commit/0f431a683968e9e9d30120eb3bf09a3f13da8814#commitcomment-7923265
[09:13:14] <fnagel> In calendar unit tests. Init date objects
[09:13:23] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[09:14:07] <jzaefferer> Would you also write 1 - 1?
[09:14:26] <fnagel> I think we already did
[09:14:34] <jzaefferer> yeah, found some of that as well
[09:14:47] <jzaefferer> seems good to me
[09:15:19] <jzaefferer> are there any Date mock libraries?
[09:15:37] <jzaefferer> We had quite a few test failures that only happened on specific dates...
[09:16:08] <fnagel> jep, thats related to a Globalize but
[09:16:12] <fnagel> * bug
[09:16:34] <fnagel> It's already fixed. We need to merge PR #1341
[09:17:08] <rxaviers> 1341 is not ready.
[09:17:14] <jzaefferer> Fixed the specific issue or the reliance on a live Date object in general?
[09:17:51] <fnagel> There is an issue in current calendar branch that will cause some uni tests to fail on specific dates (at the end of month).
[09:18:34] <rxaviers> which failure is related to Globalize?
[09:19:01] <jzaefferer> My idea is to address not just that specific issue, but the whole category of issues related to using Date. I don't know the specifics though, so maybe a Date mock wouldn't help here
[09:19:19] <fnagel> We talked about it. Some test fail on specific date. Just change the date of your system OS and it works again.
[09:19:43] <rxaviers> fnagel, does it still happen with new Globalize?
[09:20:02] <rxaviers> (we could talk about it later if you're available)
[09:20:14] <fnagel> rxaviers: afair it's fixed in your branch.
[09:20:21] <rxaviers> ok
[09:20:46] <fnagel> jzaefferer: "but the whole category of issues related to using Date" not sure what is meant with that
[09:20:48] <rxaviers> I'm wondering we both could work on the same branch after the review on yours is done.
[09:20:55] <rxaviers> wondering if*
[09:21:36] <fnagel> rxaviers: should be possible if we communicate enough
[09:22:34] <rxaviers> Is the plan to merge 1352 on datepicker branch after the review is done? So, fnagel and I continue implementing it with Globalize support.
[09:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:22:44] <rxaviers> ok
[09:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss for datepicker?
[09:24:41] <fnagel> Nothing which needs to be discussed now
[09:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:24:52] <rxaviers> nothing from me as well
[09:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to widget factory.
[09:25:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10623 is about providing a data source as an option.
[09:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> The complaint is that the source gets deep extended, which kills the external reference.
[09:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think this is a problem.
[09:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> We already support two ways of providing a data source.
[09:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> Either provide an array of objects or provide a custom object.
[09:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> Providing a plain object as a data source that you want to retain a reference to is just going to cause bloat and confusion.
[09:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts?
[09:27:18] <arschmitz> it seems unneeded
[09:28:08] <jzaefferer> I don't understand the point of talking about the 1.8 behaviour, in his last comment
[09:28:18] <jzaefferer> deep-copying everything wouldn't help him, right?
[09:28:56] <arschmitz> no he wants a refrence if i understnad right not a copy
[09:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> He's just making up fictional futures.
[09:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> You've changed the behavior before, therefore you'll change it again.
[09:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> On to 1.11.2...
[09:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> The menu typeahead bug is fixed: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10571
[09:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> And I have a PR for the delegated tooltip closing issue: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10602
[09:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1353
[09:31:16] <jzaefferer> What about Globalize and Classes option?
[09:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> We'll get to them.
[09:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing to discuss for the classes option anyway.
[09:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> If nobody has anything else they want to get into 1.11.2, we can release as soon as the tooltip PR lands.
[09:33:00] <jzaefferer> sounds fine to me
[09:34:43] <jzaefferer> "Could use a test." - yeah, especially since this is fixing a regression
[09:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Globalize update?
[09:35:41] <rxaviers> we have several updates this week
[09:36:05] <rxaviers> One is that Raphael Amorim showed interest to collaborate.
[09:36:36] <rxaviers> He showed the most interest on porting the documentation into the API site, which Scott has created the repos.
[09:37:04] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/api.globalizejs.com and the globalize branch on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[09:37:53] <rxaviers> In the meanwhile, he started to tackle format currencies support. So far he has a skeleton PR https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/325
[09:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to work with infra to get that merged into master and have the deploy scripts set up.
[09:38:08] <rxaviers> thanks
[09:38:41] <rxaviers> Another update is about CLDR as peer dependency for libraries.
[09:38:53] <rxaviers> This issue came up with our talk with Yahoo folks.
[09:39:14] <rxaviers> Npm's cldr-data https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr-data-npm and Bower's cldr-data https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr-data-bower has been created to address that
[09:39:45] <rxaviers> We've adopted it on Globalize and so santhoshtr did on santhoshtr/CLDRPluralRuleParser
[09:39:56] <rxaviers> Yahoo didnt reply about it yet.
[09:40:07] <rxaviers> I have an ongoing discussion about it on ibm-js/ecma-402 polyfil https://github.com/ibm-js/ecma402/pull/68
[09:41:10] <jzaefferer> I was wondering if we should rename Cldrjs to something else, now that we have cldr-data
[09:41:46] <rxaviers> Clarifying, cldr-data is a module that brings the JSON data.
[09:41:57] <rxaviers> cldrjs is a tool to help traverse the JSON data.
[09:42:13] <jzaefferer> Yeah, but there code examples use cldr() and Cldr()
[09:42:16] <jzaefferer> That's quite confusing
[09:42:33] <jzaefferer> *their
[09:42:56] <rxaviers> Im completely open to suggestions
[09:43:10] <jzaefferer> Let's ask Scott, he likes naming!
[09:43:22] <rxaviers> :)
[09:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the naming you're referring to is outside of the module.
[09:44:03] <jzaefferer> The module name "cldrjs" isn't great either
[09:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> It's a variable in the code samples and can easily be changed from cldr() to cldrData()
[09:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> I agree with that, I would've named it cldr.
[09:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> But that's already taken.
[09:45:08] <rxaviers> cldr was my first attempt. But, yeap it's been taken
[09:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> What's the overlap?
[09:45:31] <rxaviers> actually, I think the difference between cldr vs. cldr-data is even more confusing
[09:45:35] <jzaefferer> cldr-data + cldr-traverse?
[09:45:53] <rxaviers> it doesn't simply traverse.
[09:46:11] <rxaviers> it also instantiate locales
[09:46:15] <rxaviers> en = new Cldr("en")
[09:46:20] <jzaefferer> (we should update both to mention the difference between them and the node "cldr" module)
[09:46:49] <fnagel> Does it need to be named cldr something?
[09:46:51] <rxaviers> en.main("numbers") corresponds to en.get("main/{languageId}/numbers")
[09:47:07] <rxaviers> anyway
[09:48:52] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that's just a helper for the traversal, isn't it?
[09:49:13] <jzaefferer> also its very specific to cldr, right?
[09:49:23] <rxaviers> For every suggestion, please weigh in: https://github.com/rxaviers/cldrjs/issues/7
[09:49:25] <jzaefferer> I don't think a more generic name would make sense
[09:49:41] <jzaefferer> Can you reopen it then?
[09:49:51] <rxaviers> It's good to provide an example with the names considering globals, commonJs and AMD environments
[09:50:15] <rxaviers> As soon as I get a comment, I'll reopen it
[09:50:16] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:50:29] <jzaefferer> I don't comment on closed issues :p
[09:50:45] <rxaviers> :P
[09:51:17] <rxaviers> It simply doesnt make sense to reopen if there's no change in the issue.
[09:51:27] <jzaefferer> speaking of reopening, at some point you should give a set of keys to that project to someone on our team
[09:51:31] <rxaviers> But, you are able to comment on closed ones right
[09:51:41] <rxaviers> if you have any trouble I can surely reopen in advance
[09:53:01] <jzaefferer> nevermind, I'll comment there
[09:53:07] <rxaviers> Another front I got rolling this week is about supporting ICU message format, which I've talked with Alex Sexton on Chicago and didn't want to cool down: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/321
[09:54:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, are you joining the talk with IBM and Dojo?
[09:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: We only have 4 minutes left.
[09:56:50] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I'll check the doodle
[09:57:01] <rxaviers> ok
[09:57:02] <rxaviers> Im done
[09:58:03] <scott_gonzalez> Last thing on the agenda is that tj_vantoll has the menu item wrapping PR ready for review.
[09:58:06] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1342
[09:58:20] <jzaefferer> Still using div sewage?
[09:58:29] <tj_vantoll> Unfortunately yes.
[09:58:50] <jzaefferer> looks like it'll clash with the classes changes
[09:59:20] <fnagel> Please note: I'll move to another place this weekend and it seems I won't have proper inernet or mobile internet connection until next meeting.
[09:59:29] <tj_vantoll> It'll have to be merged in yes.
[10:00:50] <jzaefferer> So who's going to work on finish classes?
[10:01:40] <tj_vantoll> Once 1.11.2 is out are we going to start putting 1.12 stuff in master?
[10:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:01:52] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i will
[10:01:56] <tj_vantoll> I can do that font-size change and remove the IE7 hacks.
[10:02:06] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i need it for other stuff so ill do it
[10:02:13] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay, thanks
