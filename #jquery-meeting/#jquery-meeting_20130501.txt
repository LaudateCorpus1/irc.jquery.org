[09:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov ngsilverman petersendidit rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:01:08] <petersendidit> hey
[09:01:10] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:12] <gnarf> hey
[09:01:19] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:14] <tj_vantoll> heyo
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers, jzaefferer and I have been working through the grunt/download builder duplication.
[09:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> We've got an overall plan, just working on the details at this point :-)
[09:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> So we're finally all on the same page.
[09:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything specific you want to mention/discuss?
[09:04:05] <rxaviers> yeap, the manifest fields
[09:04:56] <rxaviers> you gave a couple of options, is what I suggested ok?
[09:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> Moving the effects demos might be the best option.
[09:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to look into it and see if there are any issues that would come from that.
[09:06:33] <rxaviers> great, ok.
[09:06:51] <rxaviers> what about the docs, shall we move the puff-effect, and size-effect into scale-effect too?
[09:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> We should just stop shoving multiple effects into a single file.
[09:07:30] <scott_gonzalez> At least that's my thought.
[09:07:45] <rxaviers> so, maybe split them?
[09:08:50] <rxaviers> if we do that, we have no more issues on demo and docs fields (for DB point of view)
[09:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'd like to hear from mikesherov and gnarf about splitting out those effects.
[09:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok, on to classes option.
[09:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit went through the widgets and updated them.
[09:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> We have a few odd places to deal with
[09:11:29] <tj_vantoll> Have we heard anything from mobile yet?
[09:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> Like corners on buttonsets and menu which uses anchors inside all menu items.
[09:11:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: shouldn't be to hard to do, its just a matter of tracking the dependencies then
[09:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Not yet.
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> puff -> scale -> size, right?
[09:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers is working through failing tests with the pointer events code.
[09:15:04] <kborchers> thinking there is something up with the tests but have to dig deeper
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> MS Open Tech is going to look at the implementation as well, and try to figure out the pros and cons of a jQuery special event vs. hand.js.
[09:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally there are no cons to using hand.js.
[09:15:56] <kborchers> if i bind the events myself everything is fine but in the pointerup tests for example, i never get a pointerup event … it's just weird
[09:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> Because then we can just promote a solution that works for everyone, not just jQuery users.
[09:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I can look at that later today or tomorrow with you.
[09:17:31] <kborchers> let me check my schedule with "the boss" and i'll let you know but yeah, i would appreciate another set of eyes
[09:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> We're making progress with menubar and selectmenu :-)
[09:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I did some pair reviewing.
[09:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll is giving a talk at the Portland conf about HTML5 vs. jQuery UI
[09:20:44] <tj_vantoll> I wanted to talk a bit about how UI can provide feedback to help improve the spec itself and I'm looking for specific examples if anyone has any.
[09:21:33] <tj_vantoll> stepUp / stepDown defaulting to 0 steps and input[type="range"] / slider orientation are two that I have at the moment.
[09:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> I plan to bring up dialog focus as well.
[09:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> There's a mismatch between HTML5 and ARIA.
[09:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> So you can expect a thread about that soon.
[09:23:59] <tj_vantoll> Cool
[09:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone thinks of anything else, I guess just post in #jqueryui-dev.
[09:24:20] <tj_vantoll> Yeah just ping me and let me know. Thanks.
[09:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> That brings us to key codes...
[09:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> This list was originally pretty big.
[09:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> About a year ago, I ripped out all the control keys.
[09:26:37] <scott_gonzalez> COMMAND, SHIFT, etc.
[09:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> Now I'd like to remove the NUMPAD_* values as well.
[09:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> Also, perhaps remove BACKSPACE, COMMA, and PERIOD
[09:27:30] <tj_vantoll> Because they're not consistently correct, or…?
[09:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't think we will ever use them.
[09:27:58] <tj_vantoll> Ah
[09:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone think any of those values should stay?
[09:30:01] <petersendidit> Are we going to break alot of third party code by removing thos?
[09:30:16] <kborchers> for some reason i feel like BACKSPACE could have a use but can't think of one right now
[09:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, I thought the same thing, but could only think of DELETE being used.
[09:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe just remove the NUMPAD values?
[09:31:24] <kborchers> yeah, i am ok with removing those
[09:31:40] <kborchers> don't really see a need for COMMMA and PERIOD either
[09:31:48] <kborchers> just BACKSPACE nags at me
[09:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:32:32] <tj_vantoll> I'm for removing any codes we're not using. Easy enough for us to add them back if/when we need them.
[09:33:05] <kborchers> that's true too … if we're not using BACKSPACE now but it comes up later we can always put it back
[09:33:17] <tj_vantoll> We don't expose them through our API docs anywhere correct?
[09:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, but we should add an entry :-)
[09:34:25] <tj_vantoll> *After* we trim them down :)
[09:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers also asked if we should switch to using event.which instead of event.keyCode.
[09:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Is there a benefit to doing that?
[09:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> We only respond to things like arrow keys, page up, home, etc.
[09:39:07] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez we copy keyCode to the standard event object but don't normalize it, if that's required
[09:39:35] <DaveMethvin> so it could be charCode or keyCode
[09:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we don't have any situations where normalization matters.
[09:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because we don't listen for specific characters.
[09:42:16] <rxaviers> thanks for clarifying
[09:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it.
[09:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[10:36:11] <Guest63815> what is that mean?
[10:36:23] <Guest63815> failed to identify in time for nickname?
[10:59:40] <gnarf> quick meeting for infra - anyone actually here? ryanneufeld Krinkle?
[11:00:01] <gnarf> I want to try and find some time today to figure out the php issue that got be stopped up with jenkins
[11:00:16] <gnarf> thats really the only issue of import at the minute i think
[11:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm here.
[11:00:32] <gnarf> yay! :)
[11:00:45] <Krinkle> hi
[11:00:47] <s5fs> hi
[11:01:04] <Krinkle> gnarf: what php issue?
[11:01:23] <gnarf> Krinkle: builds.jenkins vhost is passing the request off to php-fpm
[11:01:36] <gnarf> but all i get is a white screen
[11:01:50] <gnarf> when i was implementing all of it, i just stopped there because i didn't have a ton of time
[11:02:00] <gnarf> but, i'll iron it out soon i think
[11:02:14] <Krinkle> ok
[11:04:06] <gnarf> also, random bit of news, ran into a full-stack/infra kinda guy here in PDX - s5fs -- gonna see if he's interested in working with us as another infra person (cc'ed from -infra)
[11:04:17] <s5fs> hi everyone!
[11:05:11] <danheberden> pdx has all the best
[11:05:16] <danheberden> (obvs)
[11:05:39] <gnarf> infra meetings are so boring, anyone got any issues to raise?
[11:20:16] <gnarf> i'll take that as a no
