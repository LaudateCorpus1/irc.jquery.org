[01:04:23] <uGoMobi> hi all
[01:05:19] <uGoMobi> this is the jQuery Mobile / Web UI Framework meeting
[01:05:30] <uGoMobi> about 1.5 development for jQuery Mobile
[01:05:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ will be here in 5 or 10 minutes
[01:06:12] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Ok~
[01:06:53] <uGoMobi> thanks for the PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348/
[01:07:30] <uGoMobi> I was just discussing it with _|Nix|_ on #jqueryui-dev
[01:07:50] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: ah~
[01:08:35] <uGoMobi> I suggest we start with discussing the PR here
[01:09:26] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Ok
[01:10:01] <uGoMobi> the ui-corners-none and ui-shadow-none classes don't have to be added on widget level
[01:10:06] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Is there any problem on the PR?
[01:10:32] <uGoMobi> we can add one rule in the theme.css file
[01:10:52] <uGoMobi> like... .ui-corners-none { border-radius: 0 !important; }
[01:11:56] <uGoMobi> because of the !important flag it will override any .ui-corners-all rule
[01:12:05] <uGoMobi> so we don't need a selector like .ui-btn.ui-corner-all.ui-corner-none
[01:12:36] <uGoMobi> the same goes for .ui-shadow-none
[01:14:43] <Kangsik> Yes. I will move that  to theme.css
[01:14:55] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: great!
[01:16:40] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[01:16:45] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[01:17:02] <uGoMobi> is there anything else regarding removing style options that is not clear or needs discussion?
[01:17:47] <_|Nix|_> Just a thought ...
[01:17:52] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Hi ~
[01:18:02] <_|Nix|_> I just wanna make clear that I get things straight.
[01:18:19] <uGoMobi> sure
[01:18:44] <_|Nix|_> Is the reason that the "!important" is OK the fact that, once ui-corner-none is applied, nobody is likely to re-apply corners later on, right?
[01:18:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct
[01:18:59] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[01:19:17] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Please make sure you comment that when you add the "!important"
[01:19:39] <uGoMobi> yeah, good point
[01:19:55] <uGoMobi> in general we don't use !important because we want users to be able to override
[01:19:55] <_|Nix|_> We should always add a comment explaining why something is "!important".
[01:20:19] <uGoMobi> in this case it's meant to be used to override
[01:20:21] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Hey!
[01:21:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, it's on the other side of the override equation, so to speak, since it's a convenience class.
[01:21:10] <uGoMobi> and the class is never used unless you add it yourself
[01:21:19] <uGoMobi> exactly
[01:21:43] <uGoMobi> one moment... doorbell
[01:21:56] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook, Kangsik: Are you guys OK with doing things this way?
[01:22:55] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: hmmm....  Should Kangsik explain/comment for the reason now?
[01:23:42] <uGoMobi> back
[01:24:11] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Nono. In the css file. Something like this: /* Add !important to make sure the radius is 0 whenever this class is applied. Since it's a class that's used only by the user when so desired, it should be OK. */
[01:24:30] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: and then the next line: border-radius: 0 !important;
[01:25:12] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: ahha~!
[01:25:20] <uGoMobi> right, although I would put .ui-corners-none { on the next line ;-)
[01:25:24] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Basically, make it clear that, while !important is generally a bad idea, in this case it is OK, because it's a convenience class, and because it's not used by the framework.
[01:25:45] <_|Nix|_> Right, well, make it valid CSS, needless to say :)
[01:25:51] <uGoMobi> :P
[01:25:55] <_|Nix|_> :)
[01:27:04] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Ok, I understand your words.
[01:27:10] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Excellent!
[01:27:26] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: great
[01:27:28] <_|Nix|_> In that case, I have some good news from arschmitz regarding web-ui-fw:
[01:27:50] <_|Nix|_> He's building a site where third-party widgets can be added to a download builder.
[01:28:22] <_|Nix|_> So we can add our web-ui-fw widgets and have them depend directly on jQM, without having to write our own build scripts and stuff like that.
[01:28:40] <_|Nix|_> IOW, exactly what we wanted, minus the infrastructure overhead.
[01:28:59] <uGoMobi> awesome
[01:29:18] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Awesome!
[01:29:20] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, really, really cool. We can start migrating web-ui-fw to his site once it goes live.
[01:30:08] <Minkyeong> _|Nix|_: That's good news :)
[01:30:48] <_|Nix|_> The site is open to all third-party widgets, but arschmitz was hoping that web-ui-fw would be the first one to contribute.
[01:31:10] <_|Nix|_> So, a huge :+1: to arschmitz!
[01:32:47] <Hyunsook> Right! a huge +1 to arschmitz~!
[01:32:57] <Hyunsook> ^^
[01:33:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. That's about all the topics I could think of. Really good progress towards 1.4.3, too.
[01:33:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, many bug fixes landed already
[01:34:00] <_|Nix|_> BTW, in yesterday's meeting we discussed when we should release 1.4.3.
[01:34:29] <_|Nix|_> IIRC, our conclusion was to wait for arschmitz's page event fix, and then release with whatever bug fixes we manage to land by that time.
[01:34:41] <uGoMobi> yup
[01:34:58] <uGoMobi> I suggested to discuss planning of 1.5 development next week
[01:35:04] <_|Nix|_> ... which should be quite a few, if we keep up this pace of landing things.
[01:35:15] <uGoMobi> we focussed on bug fixes
[01:35:19] <uGoMobi> which is great
[01:35:44] <uGoMobi> but good to have some sort of planning for 1.5
[01:35:49] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, we still have a pile of reviewing to do - things like listview and table, and maybe even panel.
[01:36:01] <_|Nix|_> ... and then navigation, ...
[01:36:07] <uGoMobi> panel is on the roadmap for 1.7
[01:36:08] <_|Nix|_> ... pointer events ...
[01:36:24] <uGoMobi> not that we can't make changes in the roadmap
[01:36:26] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/
[01:36:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The re-write is, right, but does that mean we restrict ourselves to bugfixes in the meantime?
[01:37:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm... we have the review on the planning
[01:37:09] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[01:37:20] <uGoMobi> with review we meant adding enhanced option etc.
[01:37:44] <uGoMobi> that might be something we want to reconsider
[01:37:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suspect we can't separate review from re-write.
[01:38:01] <uGoMobi> don't want to spend a lot of time on review and then rewrite the whole widget
[01:38:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Although the review would most likely keep the DOM structure, whereas a re-write would involve re-thinking the DOM structure as well.
[01:38:32] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's true.
[01:38:39] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, let's talk about it some more next week.
[01:38:40] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: anything on the roadmap, besides removing style options, that you and your team would like to work on?
[01:39:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I'll put it on the agenda for next week
[01:39:48] <_|Nix|_> Good call!
[01:40:18] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: We hope to all task!
[01:40:24] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: ... but.....
[01:41:35] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: .... we don't have enough time....
[01:41:44] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: we = my team
[01:41:48] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: right, I understand
[01:42:20] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: We are already very happy with all the help from you and your team
[01:42:46] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: ok let's stick to style options removal for now
[01:42:55] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: I will review Roadmap after this meeting and if there is a task that we can do, I'll send to email.
[01:43:07] <uGoMobi> I remember you talked about listview before
[01:43:15] <uGoMobi> as something you might want to work on
[01:43:15] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Thanks for looking into it!
[01:43:19] <uGoMobi> right?
[01:44:29] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: we could keep that in mind, just in case you and your team do have time
[01:44:50] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Sure~! Sorry but.... Don't get your hopes up too high. ^^;;
[01:45:42] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: yeah, don't worry... I don't expect anything
[01:46:12] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Thanks for understanding ^^
[01:46:24] <uGoMobi> ok, anything else we need to discuss?
[01:46:30] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: No worries :) Thanks for all your help :)
[01:46:43] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'm certainly out of topics.
[01:47:07] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Right, that's all.
[01:47:11] <_|Nix|_> Good progress towards the style option reduction!
[01:47:24] <uGoMobi> yeah
[01:47:39] <_|Nix|_> OK, have a good week, all, followed by a great weekend!
[01:47:41] <uGoMobi> do we need to meet every week to discuss that?
[01:47:47] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec!
[01:47:57] <uGoMobi> or just see if there is anything to discuss?
[01:48:13] <_|Nix|_> Most people in this room will have a great weekend almost immediately after the meeting :)
[01:48:27] <_|Nix|_> I mean, in this meeting.
[01:48:30] * _|Nix|_ gives up
[01:48:34] <uGoMobi> lol
[01:48:58] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: I think, we can meet if there is anything to discuss.
[01:49:11] <_|Nix|_> Tuesday?
[01:49:35] <uGoMobi> Tuesday's at what time? (KST)
[01:50:07] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: The usual, right? Was it 4:00 PM KST?
[01:50:07] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: hmmm... 5pm (KST)?
[01:50:12] <uGoMobi> sure
[01:50:15] <_|Nix|_> Oh, 5PM.
[01:50:16] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[01:50:26] <uGoMobi> we can talk on the #web-ui-fw channel on Monday's
[01:50:42] <uGoMobi> to check if we have anything jQuery Mobile related to discuss
[01:51:04] <uGoMobi> I suppose we don't have much for next Tuesday
[01:51:47] <uGoMobi> ok?
[01:51:50] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: I do think so..
[01:51:51] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's good too. I guess this meeting is really close to Tuesday.
[01:52:01] <_|Nix|_> As they say in bugzilla: WORKSFORME
[01:52:11] <uGoMobi> :)
[01:52:23] <uGoMobi> have a great weekend all!
[01:52:31] <_|Nix|_> Have a good one!
[01:52:33] * _|Nix|_ waves
[01:52:36] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[01:52:44] <Hyunsook> Have a good weekend~!
[01:52:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can re-mod the channel.
[01:52:51] <Minkyeong> Yep, have a good weekend all
[01:52:51] <uGoMobi> go for it _|Nix|_
