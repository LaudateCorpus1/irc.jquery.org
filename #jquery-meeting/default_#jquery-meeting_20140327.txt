[11:00:05] <gseguin> hiya!
[11:00:26] <arschmitz> hi
[11:00:30] <uGoMobi> hey
[11:01:39] <uGoMobi> maybe Gabriel joins us later, I don't know
[11:01:43] <uGoMobi> let's start
[11:02:34] <uGoMobi> Kangsik from the Web UI Fw theme has been working remving style options from the button widget
[11:03:20] <uGoMobi> I discussed this on Tuesday with him and turned out something went wrong, but I didn't look at the new code yet
[11:03:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i was looking at what he emailed
[11:03:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah great
[11:03:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and unless im missing something what hes doing is not at all whats in the wiki or we discussed
[11:04:26] <arschmitz> it seems he has made all the defaults false
[11:04:44] <arschmitz> and is giving wrapperClass logic
[11:04:51] <arschmitz> where it is parsing the classes on the element
[11:05:02] <uGoMobi> I am looking at it now
[11:05:06] <arschmitz> instead of just blindly adding the classes
[11:05:15] <uGoMobi> right
[11:05:44] <arschmitz> there should not even be a change for this in 1.5 i don't think
[11:05:52] <uGoMobi> ok, this is something I will discuss with Kangsik and the others
[11:06:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think so too
[11:06:05] <arschmitz> ok
[11:06:19] <uGoMobi> as long as it's deprecated we don't need to touch code
[11:06:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok thanks i dont want it to come across negative
[11:06:46] <arschmitz> i just dont think this is what we wanted
[11:06:54] <uGoMobi> makes sense to look into how things will work in 1.6 but no code changes needed yet
[11:07:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right and what we discussed and documented in wiki for 1.6
[11:07:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no problem, the wiki page is clear about the expected result
[11:07:31] <arschmitz> is that it will keep same defaults and just always add the class
[11:07:40] <uGoMobi> so if it doesn't match we should say it
[11:07:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: correct
[11:07:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i had double checked after i looked at his email and i thought the wiki was clear
[11:08:50] <arschmitz> i wish i could make the meetings with them its just not possible with my timezone
[11:09:11] <arschmitz> its like 3 am for me and i sleep from about 1 - 7 normally lol
[11:09:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anything about the pagecontainer event demo?
[11:09:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, you shouldn't want to attend those meetings ;-)
[11:09:52] <arschmitz> im still working on it nothing new to discuss just trying to address all the issue people have brought up in the various issues
[11:09:53] <uGoMobi> for me it's 8am, so that's not too bad
[11:10:22] <arschmitz> its going to end up being a few different demos i think
[11:10:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agcolom: I was just looking at this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7276
[11:10:41] <arschmitz> because there are a few distinctly different issues people want addressed
[11:10:51] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:11:01] <uGoMobi> yeah, better to split then
[11:11:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on that one i think we should add a link
[11:11:16] <arschmitz> but i dont think we should add entries
[11:11:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was thinking just the same
[11:11:25] <uGoMobi> it are events of that widget
[11:11:30] <uGoMobi> so they belong there
[11:11:34] <arschmitz> excactly
[11:11:51] <arschmitz> and the sooner people start treating nav as a widget i think we will have less issues
[11:11:58] <uGoMobi> but I can imagine that people look at events because that's where page events were documented
[11:12:02] <arschmitz> about event and method confusion
[11:12:26] <uGoMobi> agreed
[11:12:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah which is why there should be links from the old ones
[11:12:57] <uGoMobi> ok, let's open a ticket for that at the API docs repo and close this one
[11:13:04] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:13:09] <uGoMobi> I started typing already, will finish after meeting
[11:13:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: CasperJS, did you have a chance to look at the alternatives?
[11:13:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we decided to go with casper last time
[11:13:57] <gseguin> there are no alternatives to casperjs
[11:14:07] <gseguin> it's just a matter of implementing a crawler
[11:14:15] <uGoMobi> "Looking into other solutions (eg. flexible.js or node-crawler.js) first, before landing this"
[11:14:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: did you look at any of them i sent you
[11:14:21] <uGoMobi> this is status from last week
[11:14:23] <gseguin> that will figure out if there are 404s or script errors
[11:14:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we settled that within a few minutes after meeting
[11:14:40] <gseguin> arschmitz: I did, for some reasons it reports errors
[11:14:58] <gseguin> I haven't made much progress
[11:15:09] <gseguin> I still think we should land what's there
[11:15:10] <uGoMobi> ok sorry, I saw the discussion but I didn't know it was settled already
[11:15:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok well we can figure that out im sure even if we have to fork one just a matter of one of us having time to get to it
[11:15:22] <gseguin> since we agree CasperJS is a good solution
[11:15:29] <gseguin> I'll continue working on the spider
[11:15:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: cool
[11:16:02] <arschmitz> so the casper item on the agenda is actually something else though
[11:16:13] <gseguin> right now I'm wokring on extracting the CSS builder from the DB for rxaviers
[11:16:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah try and get that first i think
[11:16:35] <arschmitz> the css builder that is
[11:16:51] <gseguin> arschmitz: we should land the PR for CasperJS since it's working and adds tests
[11:17:03] <gseguin> I'll continue working on the spider
[11:17:10] <gseguin> after I'm done with the builder
[11:17:11] <arschmitz> yup im fine with that just let me take one last quick skim and ill give it the thumbs up
[11:17:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: sounds good to me
[11:17:37] <uGoMobi> sounds good to land now we decided this is what we want/need
[11:18:09] <gseguin> you can check the test run on TravisCI to see what I'm testing
[11:18:13] <arschmitz> ok so while we are talking about casper though the agenda items is an idea i had for another use for it
[11:18:22] <gseguin> it's basic but I did re-create the issue we had
[11:18:25] <gseguin> and it caught them
[11:18:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: iv looked at it already i was actually demoing it for someone at a company yesterday
[11:19:00] <gseguin> cool
[11:19:02] <arschmitz> because they were asking me about this exact sort of testing
[11:19:29] <gseguin> it's very cool and quite easy syntax
[11:19:33] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:19:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: so this is my idea
[11:19:40] <gseguin> anyhow, what other use?
[11:19:52] <arschmitz> could we use this to replace our sequence tests?
[11:20:09] <arschmitz> in a faster and more reliable way?
[11:20:15] <gseguin> yup
[11:20:21] <arschmitz> thats what i thought
[11:20:33] <arschmitz> this seems like a better solution for sequence testing then qunit
[11:20:42] <gseguin> real functional test
[11:20:45] <uGoMobi> interesting
[11:20:50] <arschmitz> its designed exactly for that sort of thing
[11:21:02] <uGoMobi> good idea
[11:21:10] <gseguin> and you can capture the screen when there is a failure
[11:21:11] <arschmitz> so i would like to work on moving our sequence tests to casper at some point
[11:21:23] <gseguin> you also can test the responsiveness
[11:21:24] <arschmitz> it should speed up our test times i think too
[11:21:31] <gseguin> by resizing the browser
[11:21:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah
[11:22:20] <arschmitz> so i think moving our sequence tests is something we should invest some time in
[11:22:33] <arschmitz> i was hoping _|Nix|_ would be here since he made those
[11:22:38] <gseguin> Can you create an issue and assign it to me?
[11:22:39] <arschmitz> but barring objection from him
[11:22:49] <arschmitz> gseguin: sure
[11:23:01] <gseguin> I'll look into it after the spider ?
[11:23:01] <arschmitz> also it seems like this will dramaticly simplify these tests
[11:23:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: sounds good
[11:23:17] <gseguin> no kidding
[11:23:27] <uGoMobi> nice
[11:23:31] <arschmitz> right now they are crazy complicated this should make them very simple
[11:25:18] <uGoMobi> ok selectmenu
[11:25:23] <arschmitz> gseguin: if you get to it before this lands remember we are removing dialogs so dont worry about those tests
[11:25:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: ill put that in issue too
[11:25:36] <gseguin> ok
[11:25:43] <gseguin> unlikely
[11:25:52] <gseguin> but I'll keep it in mind
[11:26:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: never know i have to pretty much completely refactor selectmenu and custom select first ha ha
[11:26:11] <uGoMobi> yeah don't want to waste time on those
[11:26:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz worked on fallback for custom multiple select
[11:26:49] <uGoMobi> do you have the link to the demos in that branch arschmitz ?
[11:27:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah since i proved the concept and we are happy with it im working on a real implementation
[11:27:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup just a sec
[11:27:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[11:27:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just wanted to paste the link to the branch demos in the agenda
[11:28:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://view.jquerymobile.com/select-fallback/demos/selectmenu-custom/
[11:28:19] <uGoMobi> although that branch will be gone some time soon, people can already get an idea what it looks like
[11:28:20] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:28:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i started with the plain select
[11:28:54] <arschmitz> implementing multi select there as a starting point
[11:29:07] <arschmitz> so that will make using it as a fall back easier
[11:29:18] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:29:19] <arschmitz> and im doing the widget review at same time
[11:29:35] <arschmitz> since im changing a lot already made sense to do it at the same time
[11:29:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: adding enhanced option as well?
[11:29:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[11:29:49] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:30:03] <arschmitz> because it simplifies the fallback also
[11:30:19] <arschmitz> i did notice some weird stuff going on in there though
[11:30:28] <uGoMobi> yeah, makes sense to do this now
[11:30:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: like what ?
[11:30:35] <arschmitz> like right now the regular select contains options and methods only used by the extension ?
[11:30:49] <arschmitz> they are never used by the native select
[11:31:24] <arschmitz> its almost like select was written to work with customselect and not the other way around
[11:31:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: don't we have the same with fixed toolbar?
[11:31:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope
[11:31:42] <uGoMobi> hmm ok
[11:31:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toolbar knows nothing about fixed toolbar
[11:32:17] <uGoMobi> I noticed it before and I thought it was just how the widget factory was designed
[11:32:40] <uGoMobi> and I thought we did it elsewhere too, but can't remember which widget
[11:33:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its not a big deal because we dont really document what is extension and what not well right now
[11:33:09] <arschmitz> so we can straigthen that out
[11:33:31] <uGoMobi> yeah, better clean that up
[11:33:43] <arschmitz> yeah im doing it at the same time as everything else
[11:33:51] <uGoMobi> nice
[11:34:06] <uGoMobi> how is android 4.4? ;-)
[11:34:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: once im done you can look at the multi styling maybe clean it up a littke
[11:34:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: mixed
[11:34:32] <uGoMobi> sure, will do
[11:34:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the nav issue seems fixed
[11:34:48] <arschmitz> no one can reproduce
[11:34:54] <arschmitz> cgack: tried as did i
[11:35:01] <arschmitz> and browserstack
[11:35:10] <arschmitz> so we are going to close that issue
[11:35:17] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:35:22] <uGoMobi> but then we have swipe
[11:35:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:35:46] <arschmitz> its not possible to implement swipe in the sense we think about it in 4.4 as far as i can tell
[11:35:56] <arschmitz> and there is no workaround
[11:36:25] <arschmitz> this is an old issue coming back because of changes in 4.4
[11:36:34] <uGoMobi> :(
[11:36:46] <arschmitz> it was an issue way back in android
[11:36:49] <arschmitz> but was fixed
[11:36:54] <arschmitz> but it was never fixed in chrome
[11:37:06] <arschmitz> so now that chrome is the default
[11:37:12] <arschmitz> its getting noticed
[11:37:18] <uGoMobi> right
[11:37:22] <arschmitz> its also the same as the ios chrome swipe issue
[11:37:32] <arschmitz> and the android chrome swipe issue
[11:37:35] <arschmitz> its chrome
[11:37:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, we invested a lot of time in that already
[11:37:59] <arschmitz> so on the slightly positive side
[11:38:10] <uGoMobi> looks like we have to accept there is nothing we can do about that
[11:38:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: knows the person in charge of pointer events on chrome
[11:38:44] <arschmitz> and is going to bug him about this for me when he gets a chance
[11:38:56] <uGoMobi> that would be great
[11:39:05] <arschmitz> because this is just completely broken if you want to make a swipe event
[11:39:43] <arschmitz> there is already a closed android bug with lots of ranting about fixing on chrome
[11:39:51] <arschmitz> and a chrome bug with very little action
[11:39:58] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:40:06] <arschmitz> so i gave scott links to both to show him
[11:41:07] <arschmitz> so just waiting on that to see what we get for an answer
[11:41:24] <arschmitz> so the only thing to do for now is add a warning in the docs i think
[11:42:01] <arschmitz> we can also add a demo to show how you can still use it in chrome to do swipe on a specific small element
[11:42:06] <arschmitz> but not on something like page
[11:42:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, probably good to add a "known issue" to the docs for this
[11:42:29] <arschmitz> because you can use it perfectly fine on a small elelent
[11:42:32] <arschmitz> element
[11:42:59] <arschmitz> because if you add a preventDefault to touchstart it will work but you lose scrolling
[11:43:08] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[11:43:24] <arschmitz> but if its a small element you might be ok with not being able to start a scroll on that element
[11:43:38] <arschmitz> because you could still scroll anywhere else on the page
[11:44:23] <uGoMobi> right, we should just document the problem so people can decide for themselves if they use swipe or not for their use case
[11:44:24] <arschmitz> but anyway no code changes im going to do a write up on the issue to put in the issues once we get an official answer
[11:44:48] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[11:45:07] <arschmitz> i dont want to complain too much publicly until i get an answer
[11:45:31] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:45:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anything to discuss about testswarm?
[11:46:20] <arschmitz> yeah i have talked to Krinkle and hes going to guide me through getting it setup
[11:46:28] <arschmitz> hes pretty sure all the infrastructure is in place
[11:46:46] <arschmitz> because we have an old branch that john bender had been working on it on
[11:47:32] <uGoMobi> yeah I remember
[11:47:54] <arschmitz> its confusing though because i see no changes in there related to testswarm lol
[11:48:10] <uGoMobi> what's the branch name?
[11:48:19] <arschmitz> testswarm
[11:48:23] <uGoMobi> duh
[11:48:24] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:49:28] <arschmitz> looks like there are some commits that might be related to making tests pass on it
[11:49:46] <uGoMobi> yeah, looking at the commits now
[11:50:03] <uGoMobi> just some small changes
[11:50:04] <arschmitz> but i see no config or anything
[11:50:13] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:50:18] <arschmitz> i dont even see the word testswarm in the diff lol
[11:50:20] <uGoMobi> hmm interesting
[11:50:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:50:28] <uGoMobi> magic
[11:50:31] <uGoMobi> :D
[11:50:41] <arschmitz> so im not sure how usefull this branch is or not lol
[11:50:52] <arschmitz> i have no idea what we was actually working on there
[11:51:29] <arschmitz> im going to keep it for refrence if i see problems that look potentially related to these commits or something
[11:51:33] <uGoMobi> I thought John was fighting with IE mostly
[11:51:40] <uGoMobi> to get it green in testswarm
[11:51:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: could be i remember him working on it but nothing more then that
[11:52:18] <uGoMobi> but that's not this branch, I think that landed in master already
[11:52:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok
[11:52:47] <uGoMobi> but I don't remember exactly either
[11:53:01] <uGoMobi> hope there is useful stuff in there
[11:54:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you already said you are working on Download Builder
[11:54:30] <uGoMobi> the CSS bundle stuff
[11:54:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin: any updates or things to discuss?
[11:55:23] <uGoMobi> I think G took off for lunch
[11:55:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well unless you have something then i think we can call it a wrap
[11:55:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think the same
[11:55:54] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:55:57] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
