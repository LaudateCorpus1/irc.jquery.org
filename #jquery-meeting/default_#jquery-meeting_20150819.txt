[09:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> Still not bot, huh?
[09:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer awayrxaviers rxaviers
[09:01:08] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: told me he was down with a fever last night so i would not expect him
[09:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still catching up on what happened in the past week and a half.
[09:03:01] <arschmitz> yeah not suprised
[09:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> So splitting up core...
[09:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> Did that get wrapped up?
[09:03:31] <arschmitz> yup its landed on master
[09:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:04:02] <arschmitz> also landed an update to spinner
[09:04:10] <arschmitz> and some other theme stuff
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> Why don't you update the agenda?
[09:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> Would be more efficient than me doing it ;-)
[09:04:23] <arschmitz> ok
[09:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:05:22] <arschmitz> ha ha ha
[09:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> oops
[09:05:51] <fnagel> ahh
[09:05:53] <fnagel> ok
[09:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Was the core split the last thing I was waiting on for the datepicker merge?
[09:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Or is there still something else I'm waiting on?
[09:06:55] <arschmitz> um did we figure out the globalize cultures file
[09:07:06] <arschmitz> that was causing issues last i remember
[09:07:21] * scott_gonzalez That's a separate issue.
[09:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> Huh, just learned something new about Textual...
[09:07:51] <arschmitz> oh you just meant to do it with out everything clowing up
[09:07:54] <arschmitz> blowing up
[09:07:59] <arschmitz> again
[09:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> I was waiting on two things, but I don't remember what the other was.
[09:08:15] <arschmitz> should be good button does not touch it
[09:08:22] <arschmitz> demos
[09:08:31] <arschmitz> which is also done
[09:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> I might have time for that today after I finish catching up on stuff.
[09:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> How did that bidi/ltr discussion go?
[09:11:57] <arschmitz> Really well
[09:12:35] <arschmitz> they plan to contribute over the next few years working one widget at a time submitting prs and working through to fully implement
[09:12:38] <jacques_perrault> I'm working with the IBM bidi team to get them "IBM approved" for contribution, and then will have them sign the CLA.
[09:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good, jacques_perrault.
[09:12:57] <jacques_perrault> I think we agreed to start by opening an issue for datepicker.
[09:13:00] <arschmitz> They said they plan the same level of commitment as they did to dojo
[09:13:08] <arschmitz> jacques_perrault: yes
[09:13:20] <arschmitz> it seemed like the obvious place to start
[09:13:23] <jacques_perrault> adarwish_IBM is here from bidi.
[09:14:38] <adarwish_IBM> Hello All
[09:14:45] <arschmitz> adarwish_IBM: Hi!
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> Hi adarwish_IBM
[09:15:24] <scott_gonzalez> Glad to have you helping out.
[09:15:55] <adarwish_IBM> np
[09:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> Is that everything, arschmitz?
[09:18:08] <arschmitz> i think so
[09:18:54] <arschmitz> everything i can think of or am working on was on the agenda
[09:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, maybe I actually will get to the button PR before the next meeting this time :-P
[09:19:18] <arschmitz> :-)
[09:19:21] <adarwish_IBM> I have a question, is there a general time frame to have datepicker issue handled? (as soon as submitted)
[09:19:25] <arschmitz> now iv gone and changed it a bunch lol
[09:20:17] <arschmitz> adarwish_IBM: handled as in reviewed, merged, or ...?
[09:20:24] <adarwish_IBM> yes
[09:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker is planned for the 1.13.0 release.
[09:20:46] <adarwish_IBM> I see
[09:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> So we've got at least a few months.
[09:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully 1.13 will be a much shorter cycle than 1.12.
[09:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> Because we have a pretty decent start on it already.
[09:21:08] <scott_gonzalez> But we still need to ship 1.12.0.
[09:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Though we're very close at this point.
[09:21:17] <arschmitz> Yeah 1.12 has dragged
[09:21:27] <arschmitz> so many big changes
[09:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, 1.12 dragged on like 1.9.
[09:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully 1.13 will be quick like 1.10.
[09:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> adarwish_IBM: Does that provide enough insight?
[09:23:32] <adarwish_IBM> yes, sure
[09:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> For reference, getting from 1.9.0 to 1.10.0 took three months.
[09:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> 1.11.0 took way too long (over a year)
[09:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> 1.12.0 is also taking way too long (over a year)
[09:24:47] <adarwish_IBM> I see
[09:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> But we were doing a LOT of very large changes.
[09:25:31] <adarwish_IBM> Can I help by any mean from Bidi perspective to make it happen in months not years?
[09:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> Either actually implementing them or doing lots of planning.
[09:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> And big things like coordinating other projects for integration (Globalize, Chassis, PEP)
[09:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> Absolutely. I'll be merging master into datepicker very soon (hopefully today).
[09:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Are there any big things that need to happen besides that merge before adarwish_IBM can really dig in and start sending PRs?
[09:27:12] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: :-)
[09:27:41] <fnagel> Changing all demos to AMD would be helpful (due to dealing with Globalize / Cldr)
[09:27:55] <fnagel> * all Calendar and Datepicker demos
[09:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's part of the master merge.
[09:28:38] <fnagel> I would like to make sure all unit (and lint, which is not the case atm) tests are green before somebody starts working on the branch.
[09:28:48] <fnagel> Should be helpful while doing changes
[09:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> That's why we've been waiting to do the merge. Wanted to get all the big changes into master before merging.
[09:29:05] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: right
[09:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm down to 112 emails in my inbox, so I *think* I'll get to the merge this afternoon.
[09:30:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we should think about doing a jscs fix on master and see if we can bump our version
[09:30:35] <arschmitz> right now we cant upgrade to latest because the rule changes cause to many issues
[09:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, unlike the core team, I don't care how many style fix commits we have.
[09:31:03] <arschmitz> so we are essentially still on an oldversion of the style guide
[09:31:11] <arschmitz> cool ill do it then
[09:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's everything.
[09:32:32] <arschmitz> yup
[09:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
