[03:00:22] <Changsuk> Hi~
[03:00:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Changsuk, Kangsik, arschmitz: Hey, all!
[03:01:30] <Kangsik> hi :-)
[03:01:37] <gabriel_schulhof> How's it going?
[03:01:54] <Hyunsook> Hi, All~
[03:02:07] <Minkyeong> hi, all
[03:02:15] <Changsuk> Hyunsook, Can you describe work status for us?
[03:02:36] <Hyunsook> gabriel_schulhof, Changsuk: Kangsik will share a result of looking into Textinput.
[03:03:06] <Kangsik> I think that I need not modify options of textinput widget.
[03:03:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Excellent! Can you do it all with documentation, and the application of the classes you have created for button?
[03:03:40] <Kangsik> CSS(ui-corner-none) that were added in the past  could disable the option(data-corner).
[03:03:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome!
[03:05:03] <Kangsik> So, I should only modify test code and documents.
[03:05:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Well, you can change the code in the sense that you need to add // Option "corners" is deprecated as of 1.5.0
[03:05:49] <gabriel_schulhof> into the widget code.
[03:06:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: ... but otherwise, yeah ... demos, tests, and API docs only.
[03:06:10] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Yep.
[03:06:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Excellent!
[03:06:47] <Changsuk> Kangsik: Thanks for your work~
[03:06:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, thanks a lot, Kangsik!
[03:07:08] <Hyunsook> Kangsik: +1
[03:07:12] <Hyunsook> ^^
[03:07:26] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: NP :-0
[03:07:27] <Kangsik> please give me a some time to work that.
[03:08:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Kangsik: Absolutely!
[03:08:27] <Kangsik> @gabriel_schulhof: Thank you. :-)
[03:08:43] <Changsuk> Kangsik: Do you need some time to work on jQM widgets?
[03:09:27] <Kangsik> Changsuk: Yes.
[03:09:42] <Changsuk> gabriel_schulhof, Kangsik: I think, Gabriel already gave you some time. haha~~
[03:09:56] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[03:11:01] <gabriel_schulhof> So far, so good.
[03:11:12] <gabriel_schulhof> As you know, jQM 1.4.3 was released recently.
[03:11:25] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I've done some work on web-ui-fw to make it work with 1.4.3.
[03:11:58] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm currently working on the API docs. I'll try to make a release soon, and I'll try to advertise it on jquerymobile.com.
[03:12:19] <Hyunsook> Oh~ Cool~
[03:12:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... hopefully we can get some more exposure that way.
[03:13:56] <gabriel_schulhof> So, that's about it for now. A few bugs since 1.4.3 was released, but nothing major.
[03:14:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Any other topics?
[03:15:56] <Hyunsook> gabriel_schulhof: Thanks that you share news for jQM and web-ui-fw. ^^
[03:16:12] <Hyunsook> gabriel_schulhof: I think my team told you all.
[03:16:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Hyunsook: NP. I'm happy to do it.
[03:16:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Hyunsook: OK. Great!
[03:16:42] <gabriel_schulhof> In that case, have a good week and a relaxing weekend! See y'all next week!
[03:17:06] <Hyunsook> Have a good week and weekend~
[03:17:21] <Minkyeong> yep, see y'all next week :-)
