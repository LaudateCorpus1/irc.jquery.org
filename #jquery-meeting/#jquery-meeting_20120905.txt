[08:35:47] <jzaefferer> test
[08:36:08] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just updated the agenda. I might not be able to make it. Also I'm tired after 9 hours of non-stop meetings......
[08:36:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer rworth rxaviers kborchers gnarf
[09:01:17] <rworth> here
[09:01:18] * rxaviers here
[09:01:24] <jzaefferer> On my phone...
[09:01:26] <kborchers> here
[09:01:54] <gnarf> yup
[09:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Want to start off with the bot.io work you were doing?
[09:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> Are we now going to just build our own services using the new GitHub API?
[09:03:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think we should try it
[09:03:28] <gnarf> it seems not difficult as a grunt plugin?
[09:03:30] <kborchers> gnarf: aka spamming everyone's inbox :P
[09:03:48] <gnarf> but yeah, /botio test should work on jqueryui and jquery
[09:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:04:17] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see my gist?
[09:04:34] <jzaefferer> Does it have access management? Or can just everyone trigger a test?
[09:04:47] <gnarf> there is a whitelist of users
[09:04:52] <gnarf> in puppet
[09:04:57] <jzaefferer> Cool
[09:05:37] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/services.pp#L15-52
[09:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you see my gist for the new API?
[09:05:51] <jzaefferer> So how does this relate to Jenkins?
[09:05:54] <gnarf> yeah, seems very simple
[09:06:02] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it uses the same commands jenkins does
[09:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it only took me a few minutes to get it working.
[09:06:35] <gnarf> tructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/files/botio/jquery-ui/on_cmd_test.js
[09:06:40] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/files/botio/jquery-ui/on_cmd_test.js
[09:06:59] <jzaefferer> So we'll use that to test branches, while Jenkins runs for every commit and nightly?
[09:07:07] <gnarf> for now
[09:07:27] <gnarf> github has a new api we can automatically do this for every commit
[09:08:05] <jzaefferer> Even on forks?
[09:08:19] <gnarf> https://github.com/blog/1227-status-api
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We can do it on PRs from forks.
[09:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> I set https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/485 to pending with the API.
[09:09:03] <jzaefferer> That's what we need.
[09:09:09] <gnarf> yeah
[09:09:13] <gnarf> i think we can do this
[09:09:18] <gnarf> seems simple enough
[09:10:11] <jzaefferer> Btw. AndChat (Android IRC client) plus ZNC to maintain channels is awesome
[09:10:25] <jzaefferer> Up next, docs?
[09:10:46] <kborchers> jzaefferer: except that andchat eats your battery like crazy
[09:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> Docs are almost done.
[09:11:14] <gnarf> um download builder should be running on the builder machine now jzaefferer
[09:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> I've done at least 2 passes through every entry at this point.
[09:11:17] <gnarf> assuming its stable
[09:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> And kborchers has implemented most of the design.
[09:11:31] <jzaefferer> I only need it for half an hour train ride, can charge afterwards
[09:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> I just landed some more style updates.
[09:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[09:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> I plan on updating the styling for widget methods with return values and widget methods with multiple signatures: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#method-option
[09:12:08] <jzaefferer> gnarf: on stage, right. Just wondering what we need when we go live.
[09:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> But other than that, I think it's good enough to deploy.
[09:12:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: if you push a symver tag, it should pull updates on the "live" server
[09:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: semver
[09:12:50] <rworth> yeah, it's looking great
[09:12:51] <gnarf> i know
[09:12:59] <gnarf> i realize after i typo it EVERY time scott_gonzalez
[09:13:01] <rworth> way2go scott_gonzalez and kborchers
[09:13:46] <jzaefferer> On Chrome/Android, the QuickNav is kinda borked
[09:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> It probably isn't responsive yet.
[09:14:15] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i haven't messed with responsive stuff on that yet
[09:14:17] <jzaefferer> gnarf: okay, will rest that
[09:14:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems good
[09:14:53] <jzaefferer> It is kinda responsive, though currently wasting a lot of space
[09:15:07] <jzaefferer> Needs less borders and double padding
[09:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I fixed the problem with demos not working in IE too.
[09:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid IE executs scripts in the order that they load when using document.write().
[09:16:20] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i'll mess with that tonight. didn't get a chance to work last night so i'll play with that later
[09:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> So inline scripts always run first :-/
[09:16:55] <jzaefferer> kborchers: okay, though it's probably not the most important thing
[09:16:55] <gnarf> so, do we want to launch this?
[09:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> My "fix" was to just wrap all of the inline scripts in window.onload = function() {...}
[09:17:10] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, should be quick though i think
[09:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We're waiting for 1.9.
[09:17:14] <jzaefferer> Filing and ticket would be enough
[09:17:48] <jzaefferer> Which gets us to download builder
[09:17:58] <jzaefferer> rxaviers?
[09:19:06] <rxaviers> The ThemeRoller server part is completed. Now, builder includes theme files following what we specified (updated from our last talk yesterday) (updated in the wiki as well). It minifies the custom theme "live" (per-package). It generates the theme images by fetchnig them from the current 1.8 ThemeRoller server.
[09:19:21] <rxaviers> Unit tests for both Builder and ThemeRoller are also completed. Builder have been updated to check the theme file structure specifics (folder-name differences, and whether or not theme files must be present). Unit tests for ThemeRoller have been created. Here, it tests the theme css content and handling folder-name defaults correctly {<theme name>, or `no-theme`, or `custom-theme`}.
[09:19:34] <rxaviers> Server part seems to work 100% fine now.
[09:19:45] <rxaviers> Now, I'm starting its front end part.
[09:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:20:08] <rxaviers> :)
[09:20:33] <jzaefferer> That's where it gets interesting
[09:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like you're making really good progress.
[09:21:08] <jzaefferer> Integrating into jqueryui.com might become a challenge
[09:21:31] <jzaefferer> Hopefully the approach from the download page just works
[09:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> I started working on the demos for jqueryui.com.
[09:23:23] <rxaviers> Yeap, updating builder and unit tests was intense. Now, I'll learn how the old themeRoller works and port it (hopefully smoothly)
[09:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason they're not loading on stage, so I'll need to dig into that.
[09:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[09:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> We also need to figure out how we're going to handle /accordion/#some-demo
[09:25:23] <jzaefferer> And Scott finally realized that Menu is as bat shit crazy as position
[09:25:37] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, yes
[09:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> There are issues with focus after click that need to be resolved.
[09:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> I started working on that yesterday, but didn't finish.
[09:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> We need to make a decision about this.
[09:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> Right now when you click on a menu item, it moves focus to the menu itself.
[09:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think if the menu item that was clicked is on the first level, then focus should not move.
[09:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> That would handle the case of a flat inline menu really well.
[09:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> And for popups, it doesn't matter if focus moves or not.
[09:27:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: should not move from what is clicked or should not move from the current menu which it may or may not be on
[09:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> But for nested menus when the menus will close on click, then we have to move focus.
[09:27:28] <scott_gonzalez> Should not move from what is clicked.
[09:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> So actual focus probably needs to move.
[09:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> But we shouldn't be triggering menublur.
[09:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> If the clicked item is on the first level.
[09:28:12] <kborchers> "on the level"
[09:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> heh, "on the main level"
[09:28:16] <kborchers> lol
[09:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> Does that make sense?
[09:28:51] <kborchers> i think that makes sense
[09:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:29:04] <kborchers> what about when a click opens a submenu
[09:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll keep working on that. If I get stuck, I'll just dump it into kborchers' pile of work :-P
[09:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> Leave the clicked item active.
[09:29:38] <scott_gonzalez> There's a timer that will move focus anyway, right?
[09:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, whatever makes sense in terms of the actually active item.
[09:29:59] <kborchers> yes, that's what i was getting at. should that timer be stopped but sounds like no
[09:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll work on that this afternoon.
[09:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, one more thing that I keep forgetting about.
[09:31:01] <kborchers> ok, if you don't finish just push to a branch on your repo and let me know where you're at and i can look tonight
[09:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> We need a blog for the new site.
[09:31:09] <rxaviers> guys, Im not into the details of this bug. But, it sounds like one I had with popup
[09:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: What's going on with that? I assume work hasn't started yet?
[09:31:28] <rxaviers> which I fixed here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/668
[09:31:35] <rxaviers> wondered if that could help
[09:31:41] <rworth> scott_gonzalez was blocked by that user list work
[09:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The issue is just about focus here.
[09:32:21] <rworth> to get all the authors of all previous blog posts on all blogs in as wp users
[09:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Ok, I really don't want to go back to that guy and tell him again that I don't want this code in grunt-wordpress.
[09:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm not sure the best way to proceed.
[09:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> We can just take his code and dump it into whatever repo is responsible for managing users.
[09:33:07] <rworth> o
[09:33:08] <rworth> ok
[09:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> Was that profiles.jquery.com?
[09:33:23] <rworth> yes
[09:33:49] <rworth> let me double-check
[09:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress/pull/8
[09:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't follow our coding standards.
[09:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> And it relies on a 3rd party WordPress plugin.
[09:34:33] <rworth> profiles.jquery.org
[09:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> So, this is tricky.
[09:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> We're consolidating to a single blog, right?
[09:37:05] <rworth> eventually, yes
[09:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> So right now we'll have blog.jqueryui.com?
[09:37:52] <rworth> I think we'll need to until we get all the sites that have blogs switched. Or rather all the blogs switched
[09:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that makes it less tricky.
[09:38:39] <rworth> hmm, but that means creating 5 blog jquery-content repos, rather than just one
[09:39:10] <rworth> blogs are generally standalone, so maybe we can switch them before their respective sites are ready
[09:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> The only blog that needs to be switched right away would be blog.jquery.com.
[09:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> Since we're stealing the domain.
[09:40:50] <rworth> I guess I hadn't considered doing the consolidation in stages
[09:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> My concern is just having a blog ready for the 1.9 release.
[09:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's the only big thing that hasn't been started.
[09:44:29] <rworth> then let's do it on its own as blog.jqueryui.com
[09:44:34] <rworth> have it be a guinea pig
[09:44:44] <jzaefferer> can we just dump the current blog's DB into that?
[09:44:46] <rworth> but not have plans to migrate the other blogs until we consolidate
[09:44:59] <rworth> yes, we can do a simple export of the xml
[09:45:17] <rworth> and create html files from it
[09:45:32] <rworth> then we just have to massage out some metadata into json
[09:45:39] <rworth> and theme it
[09:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:46:49] <jzaefferer> what?
[09:47:01] <jzaefferer> why bother putting the imported content on GitHub?
[09:47:08] <jzaefferer> we can still deal with that later
[09:47:38] <jzaefferer> at this point we just need to get ThemeRoller done, everything else is pretty much there
[09:47:46] <jzaefferer> so let's make the blog setup as simple as possible
[09:48:07] <rworth> in that case why do anything at this point?
[09:48:16] <rworth> We have a blog today, we can just create a new theme
[09:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good to me.
[09:48:47] <rworth> ok
[09:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a way for us to work on that?
[09:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> Without working on production.
[09:51:17] <rworth> create a local wp db, do an export from production, do an import locally
[09:51:39] <jzaefferer> gnarf: can we create stage.blog.jqueryui.com based on the current install at blog.jqueryui.com?
[09:52:20] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Sounds good. Let's create a temp repo for the theme so it's easy to work with.
[09:52:46] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can just clone it into the existing WordPress install.
[09:53:18] <rworth> can't we use web-base-template? It doesn't are how the content gets there
[09:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> This idea is a huge relief.
[09:54:14] <gnarf> um
[09:54:27] <gnarf> like not on the new wordpress server host?
[09:54:28] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: maybe, isn't there stuff in there that expects multi-site and other things specific to our new setup?
[09:55:58] <rworth> not sure. but yeah, if that happens we can create a temp theme repo. Or just temporarily create a standalone theme in the blog.jqueryui.com folder of web-base-template
[09:56:18] <rworth> I like that second idea much better, caus then we can share css and images, which aren't multi-site specific
[09:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> But it's a question of whether using web-base-template creates a lot of work, which it might.
[09:58:19] <rworth> right
[09:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> We're out of time. See everyone back in -dev.
[10:00:08] <rxaviers> ok
