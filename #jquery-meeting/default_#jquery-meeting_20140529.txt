[11:03:54] <agcolom> hey :-)
[11:03:55] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:04:02] <jacques_perrault> hello
[11:04:09] <cgack> hello
[11:04:10] * _|Nix|_ waves enthusiastically
[11:04:19] <uGoMobi> hello jacques_perrault
[11:04:43] <uGoMobi> ok let's start with update on 1.5 development
[11:05:00] <uGoMobi> cgack: you opened a PR for navbar today
[11:05:27] <uGoMobi> looks good
[11:05:42] <cgack> I did - its still a work in progress obviously but now everyone can follow along with my progress
[11:05:52] <uGoMobi> perfect
[11:06:27] <uGoMobi> cgack: any problems you ran into that you want to discuss now?
[11:07:24] <cgack> well there are bound to be some styling issues moving from using grid to the table layout - i know of one issue in firefox when navbars with icons are in footers - but those are things that can be addressed as we go
[11:09:56] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:10:01] <arschmitz> yeah id like to pull this into a branch soon so we can start trying it out working on demos etc
[11:10:31] <uGoMobi> good idea
[11:11:07] <arschmitz> we will have to pull to branch close current pr and cgack you will need to open a new one against the branch for anything new
[11:11:37] <cgack> i can do that (i think)
[11:12:02] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. That's how I originally contributed popup.
[11:12:09] <arschmitz> cgack: no one of us will have to do everything execpt open the new pr
[11:12:42] <cgack> That is something I am capable of.
[11:12:47] <arschmitz> :)
[11:12:49] <uGoMobi> we have to do a lot of device testing too if we move to table layout
[11:13:13] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec - table layout? Does that mean display: table-*?
[11:13:25] <cgack> yes
[11:13:48] <arschmitz> makes sense here we want the width to fill like table cells do
[11:13:49] <_|Nix|_> Whew! I know there are all kinds of weird idiosyncrasies with that on various browsers.
[11:13:56] <_|Nix|_> Like, random paddings and stuff.
[11:14:05] <arschmitz> but yes will require lots of testing
[11:14:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we have dropped support for a lot of older / weirder stuff
[11:14:38] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, hopefully.
[11:14:52] <_|Nix|_> ... the idiosyncrasies are confined to those.
[11:15:02] <cgack> i've tested back through ie8 locally and nothing horrifying happens - but I haven't hit old android yet
[11:15:04] <arschmitz> ie8 / android 2.3 are oldest we officially support in 1.5
[11:15:12] <uGoMobi> actually, the grid layout caused a lot of trouble too with the subpixel problem on BB and IE
[11:15:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i ran into that a lot with it in ie8
[11:15:42] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I remember. Had to set width to like, 33.333332% or something like that.
[11:15:59] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:16:13] <arschmitz> there were times in ie8 where navbars would split to 2 lines because they were too long
[11:16:18] <uGoMobi> so let's just test table layout and we will see
[11:16:50] <agcolom> I'm happy to do some testing too, so if you need me to try things out, just shout
[11:17:26] <uGoMobi> and the overflow hidden to give the navbar height with the floating buttons was causing weird issues on Android if you used it inside a fixed footer
[11:17:27] <arschmitz> yeah ill run it through everything here i have pretty much everything we need it tested on
[11:18:04] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:18:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what doesnt cause issues in side a fixed footer on old android
[11:18:13] <uGoMobi> right, lol
[11:18:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: any update on table
[11:18:39] <uGoMobi> table widget review that is
[11:18:52] <_|Nix|_> A question: Should I include an option that effectively turns off the entire popup extension?
[11:19:26] <uGoMobi> does that require an option
[11:19:27] <_|Nix|_> If someone wants to do their own UI for turning off columns, as it stands they can turn off the button, but the popup is still created unconditionally if the extension is present.
[11:19:31] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[11:19:35] <_|Nix|_> It requires an option.
[11:19:44] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:19:54] <_|Nix|_> Option that, when false, renders the value of the columnButton option irrelevant, because there will be no button.
[11:20:06] <uGoMobi> I thought it wouldn't be created if you didn't include the extension
[11:20:12] <_|Nix|_> It's not.
[11:20:29] <_|Nix|_> This is for people who don't want the popup, but still wanna use jQM from the mirror.
[11:20:45] <_|Nix|_> With DB you just skip the extension. It's easy.
[11:21:04] <uGoMobi> then I think we don't need an option
[11:21:39] <_|Nix|_> How else can you prevent the widget from creating the popup when the popup extension is present?
[11:21:48] <uGoMobi> not
[11:22:00] <uGoMobi> but people should really use a custom build
[11:22:06] <uGoMobi> that's what we recommend
[11:22:22] <_|Nix|_> OK. So your only means of preventing the creation of a popup is to use DB and turn off the popup extension.
[11:22:25] <_|Nix|_> That
[11:22:29] <_|Nix|_> 's fine by me.
[11:22:35] <arschmitz> hmm think i disagree here
[11:23:02] <arschmitz> if its an extension you should be able to control it through an option i think every single extension we have works this way
[11:23:16] <arschmitz> the extension adds an option
[11:23:25] <arschmitz> and then checks it where needed
[11:23:54] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:23:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This also kinda adds a little more impetus to turning button into an extension.
[11:24:01] <uGoMobi> the extension adds the option
[11:24:12] <uGoMobi> didn't realize that
[11:24:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because there's no sense in { columnButton: true, columnPopup: false }
[11:24:38] <cgack> can columnButton control both?
[11:24:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but I guess whether it's two extensions or one, the code is the same. If you don't add a popup, you don't add a button.
[11:24:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we actually have it the other way around in custom select right now which is bad but yeah idea is extension adds an option
[11:24:46] <uGoMobi> is this also the case with the textinput widget? does autogrow add an option?
[11:24:54] <_|Nix|_> cgack: No, because people may want the popup, just not the button.
[11:25:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[11:25:08] <cgack> ah i see
[11:25:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IINM.
[11:25:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes it does
[11:25:19] <arschmitz> so does the clear button
[11:25:24] <arschmitz> so does fixedtoolbars
[11:25:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:25:30] <_|Nix|_> Yes, it adds an option.
[11:25:50] <_|Nix|_> This makes it really easy to turn off extensions.
[11:25:51] <arschmitz> this is how we will add enanced to button checkbox in future too
[11:26:25] <arschmitz> the extension will add an option and then check that option within the method that does the enhancment to skip it
[11:26:28] <uGoMobi> if the extension adds the option I have no objection
[11:26:37] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:26:46] <_|Nix|_> OK. I will add the option.
[11:27:27] <_|Nix|_> Other than that, things are humming along.
[11:27:44] <_|Nix|_> Extensions established, coverage green, tests passing.
[11:27:45] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:27:57] <_|Nix|_> ... and a lot faster (the tests and the table itself, too).
[11:28:14] <_|Nix|_> I still wanna step through the instantiation of a table and see if I can simplify some of the code paths.
[11:28:15] <uGoMobi> I like :P
[11:28:30] <_|Nix|_> ... but I'll do that after all features are implemented.
[11:29:05] <_|Nix|_> I couldn't completely flatten the widget, because there are still places where you need to .each( function() {});
[11:29:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unavoidable
[11:29:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's avoidable, but not worth avoiding.
[11:30:25] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, I'll keep chugging along. This was my only outstanding question.
[11:30:32] <uGoMobi> great
[11:30:37] <_|Nix|_> ... related to table.
[11:30:47] <_|Nix|_> I still have two in the meeting notes.
[11:30:48] <uGoMobi> looking at 1.4.3 tickets https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=30&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:31:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I saw them
[11:31:39] <uGoMobi> I would be nice if we can release 1.4.3 in 1 or 2 weeks
[11:31:55] <arschmitz> i think anything that does not already have a pr should go to 1.4.4
[11:31:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sounds like you'll land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7274
[11:31:58] <uGoMobi> so we probably have re-milestone some of those tickets
[11:32:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agreed
[11:32:30] <arschmitz> lol yeah since i thought i had a week ago
[11:32:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: :)
[11:33:16] <uGoMobi> ok, I will look into the tickets and check which ones have a PR
[11:33:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Make sure you add "Re gh-5987" to the final commit.
[11:33:38] <arschmitz> its already there
[11:33:44] <arschmitz> i litterally just need to push it
[11:33:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is there a ticket for page (container) events?
[11:34:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: several lol
[11:34:29] <arschmitz> take your pick but i would probably use the one i had been posting on
[11:34:33] <uGoMobi> there was one with many comments
[11:34:37] <arschmitz> 2
[11:35:24] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7283
[11:35:56] <uGoMobi> right, that one
[11:36:06] <uGoMobi> will add a label and milestone
[11:36:09] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6865
[11:36:32] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... maybe we should have another look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6584, because, from what it sounds like, reflow table is currently broken on most platforms.
[11:36:54] <_|Nix|_> We should definitely squeeze that into 1.4.3.
[11:37:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i thought we already decided that?
[11:37:34] <uGoMobi> we already discussed
[11:37:36] <uGoMobi> right
[11:37:43] <uGoMobi> close the PR
[11:37:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ?
[11:37:57] <uGoMobi> create a PR with a commit that reverts our initial commit
[11:38:05] <arschmitz> oh right
[11:38:07] <uGoMobi> sorry, wasn't finished yet :)
[11:38:25] <arschmitz> yeah should close the commit pr from the revert though
[11:38:26] <_|Nix|_> OK. Just wanted to be sure. I'll create the PR, since the OP of that PR hasn't signed the CLA.
[11:38:36] <arschmitz> to reference why we did it
[11:38:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes he has
[11:38:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, he has. Great!
[11:39:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: he has dozens of commits on ui and works with us a lot
[11:39:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then why don't we just land that?
[11:39:28] <uGoMobi> good question
[11:39:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we can that what i was going to say in first place
[11:39:59] <arschmitz> but im not sure if its better to rever original
[11:40:34] <uGoMobi> last time we discussed this PR it was about CLA not being signed
[11:40:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what will be the difference? it will still be a commit
[11:41:00] <uGoMobi> we can change the commit message
[11:41:13] <uGoMobi> to make it mention the initial commit and revert
[11:41:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they have different meanings
[11:41:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can edit the commit and refer to the original commit.
[11:41:34] <arschmitz> the functional difference is the same they have the same code in the end
[11:42:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, let's agree. I'll pull the PR into a branch, fix up the commit message, and land. Correct?
[11:42:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You need to give the PR the :+1: though first.
[11:43:02] <arschmitz> lol i did its just before we used that syntax lol i gave it the "good to land"
[11:43:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Then I'll land it as I've described above.
[11:43:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok that works
[11:43:32] <uGoMobi> perfect
[11:43:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I'll reopen the issue about the table reflow on iOS ... 5?
[11:43:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you added two topics to the agenda
[11:43:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: probably no point
[11:44:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it wont be supported in 1.5
[11:44:18] <arschmitz> and i cant see us taking the time to fix for 1.4.x
[11:44:34] <arschmitz> actually no keep closed for sure
[11:44:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've already gotten an answer for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7274
[11:44:44] <arschmitz> official position is we will land no more bugfixes
[11:44:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I won't reopen.
[11:45:09] <arschmitz> on safari5
[11:45:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[11:45:17] <arschmitz> or old opera
[11:45:31] <_|Nix|_> *wave* ... agreed. Let's leave it.
[11:45:45] <uGoMobi> you can add the "won't fix" label
[11:46:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have such a label>
[11:46:18] <_|Nix|_> ?
[11:46:33] <uGoMobi> we used too
[11:46:37] <arschmitz> we did but we have disapearing label syndrom
[11:46:43] <arschmitz> someone keeps removing dbr too
[11:46:54] <arschmitz> i had to start keeping them in bookmarks lol
[11:47:03] <_|Nix|_> dbr?
[11:47:05] <uGoMobi> I removed some of the priority labels after checking with you
[11:47:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i knew about those
[11:47:23] <uGoMobi> that could have been me
[11:47:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup you should know what that one is
[11:47:45] <uGoMobi> I am not in favor of using a label for that
[11:47:45] <arschmitz> but thats not something for the meeting so moving on .....
[11:47:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm sorry - it's excaping me at this moment.
[11:47:50] <uGoMobi> right
[11:47:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was decided by dev leads
[11:47:59] <arschmitz> lol
[11:48:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: s/ex/es/
[11:48:11] <uGoMobi> I think I missed that
[11:48:24] <arschmitz> it was before either of us were
[11:48:31] <arschmitz> we were asked to start keeping a label
[11:48:44] <arschmitz> for Dedicated Branch Request
[11:48:53] <arschmitz> or DBR but anyway not something for meeting time
[11:48:54] <uGoMobi> right ;)
[11:49:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7440 can be removed from agenda?
[11:49:09] <_|Nix|_> OK, so my other topic is our use of document and window.
[11:49:16] <_|Nix|_> Nono.
[11:49:37] <_|Nix|_> That's one thing I really wanna discuss, because it's pretty essential.
[11:49:50] <_|Nix|_> ... and it's a long-term thing, so maybe we can talk about it in Chicago.
[11:50:11] <_|Nix|_> I guess we don't need to talk about it now, but I just remembered because of the OP filing that ticket.
[11:50:45] <_|Nix|_> ... and I remember the punch in the stomach I felt when scott_gonzalez reminded me that widgets need to work in a multi-document, multi-window environment.
[11:50:59] <_|Nix|_> ... because I realized that we're sooooo far from that.
[11:51:34] <_|Nix|_> ... especially in nav. We do a lot of window.this and window.that.
[11:51:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: widgets do framework does not
[11:52:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono! The framework must also be able to run in a multi-document, multi-window situation.
[11:52:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think we could posiibly sanly manage history in that case
[11:52:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we do get a native history stack for each window, so when you window.back(), which window are you talking about?
[11:53:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The browser can distinguish, and so should we.
[11:53:29] <arschmitz> we only manage a single history stack
[11:53:35] <arschmitz> and we wont be changing that any time soon
[11:53:54] <arschmitz> and the browser intermingles all the history stacks
[11:54:09] <arschmitz> i dont think we should even try to manage multi window history
[11:54:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just can't help but think that we could make the whole framework a widget to be instantiated on the window/document.
[11:54:56] <uGoMobi> yeah, I think that if we want to look into this for nav it should be after 2.0
[11:55:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe for 5.0
[11:55:05] <uGoMobi> sounds pretty complex
[11:55:59] <arschmitz> yeah i was kinda actually serious when i said 5.0
[11:56:07] <_|Nix|_> Either way, the low-hanging fruit here is to get rid of references to $.mobile.window and $.mobile.document.
[11:56:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, another thing.
[11:56:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually not really we just need to use those properly
[11:56:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We use a lot of $.mobile.method() in some of our widgets.
[11:56:41] <arschmitz> and not just do blindly $( window )
[11:56:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup we have been slowly cleaning that up
[11:57:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but thats not always bad just means they depend on core
[11:57:11] <arschmitz> or something else
[11:57:50] <arschmitz> its fine for a widget to depend on core if it needs to or a similar component if it needs to many things in ui depend on ui core
[11:57:59] <arschmitz> we just want to minimize where possible and it makes sense
[11:58:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... I guess. Either way, if needed, I was thinking we could turn those into objects, to be instantiated and stored as this._mobileHelpers or this._mobileCore.
[11:59:15] <arschmitz> ok before we finish i have 2 things to discuss real quick
[11:59:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why?
[11:59:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because then the widgets would be truly self-contained.
[11:59:46] <arschmitz> i dont think thats needed dependencies are ok
[11:59:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: They'd AMD-depend on core, but core would not pollute any namespace anywhere.
[12:00:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we use these in mor then just widgets
[12:00:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I know, and it's fine everywhere else, but widgets have a special onus to be self-contained.
[12:00:36] <uGoMobi> might be better to discuss actual examples
[12:00:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no they dont
[12:00:49] <uGoMobi> instead of in general
[12:01:42] <uGoMobi> I removed the milestone from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7440
[12:01:56] <uGoMobi> will close it as feature request
[12:02:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's sensible.
[12:02:16] <uGoMobi> the 1.5-2.0 milestone that was
[12:02:43] <arschmitz> ok so real important here before we finish id like to make a new rule about when we are running tests locally
[12:03:12] <_|Nix|_> Lay it on us!
[12:03:34] <arschmitz> run whatever set your working with in the browser
[12:03:50] <arschmitz> i went through evey page in an actual browser
[12:03:55] <arschmitz> and many are broken
[12:04:12] <arschmitz> they pass fine in phantom but completely fail in a any actual browser
[12:04:29] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I usually run them in phantom and Chrome.
[12:04:33] <arschmitz> or have other issues like errors or 404's etc
[12:04:47] <arschmitz> style completely broken
[12:05:33] <_|Nix|_> That's a good plan.
[12:05:39] <uGoMobi> +1
[12:05:55] <arschmitz> another thing test related i have run into
[12:06:06] <_|Nix|_> Maybe we should add that to the contributing guide.
[12:06:09] <arschmitz> unit tests should not include the whole framework i think
[12:06:31] <arschmitz> they should just be the parts we are actually testing so like for a widget
[12:06:35] <_|Nix|_> We still abuse the expression "unit tests"
[12:06:51] <arschmitz> all the unit tests should actually manually call the widget with js and run tests
[12:07:07] <arschmitz> not include init or the frame work at all
[12:07:17] <_|Nix|_> Well, we kinda need both.
[12:07:26] <arschmitz> 90% of the unit tests dont even require the framework or have anything to do with it
[12:07:27] <_|Nix|_> ... but I guess that's what integration tests are for.
[12:07:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i didnt say we should remove ANY tests
[12:07:45] <arschmitz> i said unit test should not include
[12:08:08] <arschmitz> for example button checkboxradio and collapsible / set
[12:08:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem is a lot of the tests under tests/unit assume that the framework will autoinit the widget.
[12:08:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: easy to fix
[12:08:32] <arschmitz> of those widgets there are only 3 tests that need the frame work to be there
[12:08:51] <arschmitz> the rest can be fixed by just adding calls to initalize the widget at the begining
[12:08:56] <uGoMobi> what does $.testHelper.asyncLoad do exactly?
[12:09:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: requirejs
[12:09:06] <uGoMobi> I mean, where do we load the whole framework
[12:09:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Whenever you load init
[12:09:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: init
[12:09:17] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:09:36] <arschmitz> this will speed up our tests a lot
[12:09:41] <arschmitz> and make them less error prone
[12:09:46] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[12:09:53] <_|Nix|_> I saw that with table.
[12:09:55] <uGoMobi> I was under the impression that we already did that
[12:10:04] <uGoMobi> also agreed
[12:10:14] <_|Nix|_> There were two pages inside the document, and it was doing $.mobile.changePage() from setup.
[12:10:17] <arschmitz> i have started this already
[12:10:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you already opened a ticket, right?
[12:10:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[12:10:33] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:10:44] <arschmitz> i ran into this trying to get browserstack-runner working
[12:11:07] <arschmitz> and thought if i removed the framework it would avoide some timeout issues
[12:11:21] <arschmitz> which it helped but a long ways from being able to use it still :(
[12:11:30] <_|Nix|_> Oh, we should also not be afraid of introducing new *-tests.html files.
[12:11:42] <_|Nix|_> Better to have a few tests in each file than a pile of tests in one file.
[12:12:00] <arschmitz> iv been working with rxaviers on browserstack-runner hes trying to use it for globalize
[12:12:08] <arschmitz> neither of us have yet had luck
[12:12:24] <arschmitz> i can get about 5 test pages to pass a single browser at a time thats bes so far
[12:12:36] <arschmitz> add more pages or browsers and things start hanging and dieing
[12:13:00] <_|Nix|_> That sounds like it's gonna be a hell of a battle.
[12:13:13] <arschmitz> im not sure its one we will win any time soon ...
[12:13:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to add browserstack jobs to travis.
[12:14:03] <_|Nix|_> I wouldn't make them break the build just yet, but it might be worth it.
[12:14:04] <arschmitz> lol
[12:14:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats the point of browserstack runner
[12:14:20] <_|Nix|_> Too bad there's no successful, but with flags/warnings/whatever
[12:14:20] <arschmitz> and it does not work yet
[12:15:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How can I run tests locally through browserstack - other than manually?
[12:15:22] <arschmitz> browserstack-runner
[12:15:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is that a grunt task?
[12:15:55] <uGoMobi> let's wrap up here
[12:15:55] <arschmitz> kinda it registers grunt task but i have not got that part working yet either
[12:16:02] <arschmitz> its a cli tool
[12:16:06] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK.
[12:16:11] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, let's wrap up.
[12:16:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just a sec ill push my branch
[12:16:19] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:16:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you have time to update http://meetings.jquery.org/category/mobile/ ?
[12:16:38] <agcolom> yes
[12:16:43] <agcolom> will do today or tomorrow
[12:16:46] <uGoMobi> awesome, thanks!
[12:16:58] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[12:17:02] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[12:17:05] <_|Nix|_> CYA
