[10:00:34] <sfrisk> Meeting for CSS-Framework is about to begin
[10:01:35] <sfrisk> Meeting Notes: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:03:09] <sfrisk> Ping scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: DaveMethvin: kborchers:
[10:03:46] <sfrisk> and @arschmitz
[10:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[10:03:55] <kborchers> hi
[10:04:35] <arschmitz> hi
[10:05:08] <sfrisk> Okay, so we have a few items on the agenda today
[10:05:50] <sfrisk> We've had some discussion about it in github, but probably should come to a firm decision on some of these items so we can move things along.
[10:07:12] <sfrisk> There is the ever looming question of "what are we going to call this thing" besides css-framework
[10:07:59] * scott_gonzalez hates naming things
[10:08:04] <sfrisk> There are some name ideas that have been posted in https://github.com/jquery/css-framework/issues/14
[10:08:16] <sfrisk> haha, so do I, scott_gonzalez
[10:08:23] <sfrisk> I typically just name things "Thing"
[10:08:28] <sfrisk> or "CSS Thing"
[10:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> CSS Thing!
[10:09:11] <arschmitz> :)
[10:10:31] <sfrisk> well, cssthing.com is available :-p
[10:11:08] <sfrisk> but is there anything in the list of possible names on issue #14 that appealed to anyone?
[10:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> I liked your suggestion of Chassis.
[10:12:11] <arschmitz> im probably partial but i liked draft :-)
[10:12:29] <kborchers> i also liked Chassis and cbracco's suggestion of bedrock
[10:12:51] <arschmitz> id be happy with either of those also
[10:13:29] <arschmitz> bedrock is a responsive grid already
[10:13:56] <arschmitz> http://dfcb.github.io/Bedrock/
[10:13:58] <arschmitz> oops
[10:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> draft css will put us in competition with W3C drafts for searches.
[10:14:19] <sfrisk> true
[10:14:45] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: there is actually almost nothing https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ie=UTF-8&q=draft%20css
[10:14:50] <arschmitz> more nhl then css
[10:15:21] <sfrisk> csschassis.com and css-chassis.com and chassis-css.com are all available
[10:16:57] <sfrisk> most search results are for Cisco hardware installation guides https://www.google.com/search?q=chassis+css&espv=2&biw=1417&bih=776&source=lnms&sa=X&ei=8wF-VPKmKq3bsASssYCABg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAA&dpr=0.9
[10:17:20] <arschmitz> yup so no real competition there
[10:21:26] <sfrisk> So looks like it's between Chassis and Draft?
[10:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> Should we take it to a vote between the two in the issue?
[10:22:44] <arschmitz> that seems like a good idea
[10:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> One week for people to vote, and then most votes wins.
[10:22:56] <arschmitz> +1
[10:22:58] <sfrisk> Sounds good to me
[10:24:27] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll set up a vote after the meeting
[10:26:25] <sfrisk> (also everyone should be able to edit now)
[10:27:11] <sfrisk> so, next up is normalization decisions.
[10:28:00] <sfrisk> it seems we came up with the decision to use a modified version of the standard normalization
[10:28:54] <arschmitz> quickly looking through the support comments on normalize.css
[10:29:09] <arschmitz> it does not seem like if we went with that there would be much if anything we didnt want
[10:30:14] <arschmitz> because normalization does not generally address bugs but things that are intentionally inconsistent
[10:33:03] * arschmitz crickets...
[10:33:38] <sfrisk> sorry, looking over normalize
[10:34:33] <sfrisk> I mean, only cases I could think of us maybe not using normalize.css for is maaaybe small, sup, sub type things if we want to style things differently
[10:35:18] <sfrisk> if we decided small shouldn't be 80% the size of the content around it
[10:35:50] <sfrisk> but arschmitz is right, this is mostly to address things that browsers intentionally do differently.
[10:37:16] <arschmitz> one advantage i see that chris bracco pointed out in that issue to using normalize or similar is that we could make it a dependency and easy to update with out a ton of effort
[10:37:50] <arschmitz> less maintenance and less reinventing the wheel
[10:38:00] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:38:58] <sfrisk> although I do like the idea of adding: http://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/
[10:39:17] <arschmitz> yeah for sure i like that too
[10:42:31] <sfrisk> So it seems like normalize.css handles a lot of the browser inconsistencies we're likely to run into. Probably just use that as a requirement, and maybe include the box sizing inheriting bit to the base styles for css-framework
[10:42:58] <arschmitz> i think if we wanted to use normalize it should be backed in
[10:43:22] <arschmitz> pulled in with like bower and rolled right up with everything else
[10:43:42] <arschmitz> rather then ask people to include another file from another repo
[10:44:23] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:46:20] <sfrisk> okay so onto the next topic
[10:46:24] <sfrisk> which should be a short one
[10:46:51] <sfrisk> naming conventions discussion is in full week and we should be having a phone call next week with the guys  behind BEM to discuss that
[10:47:40] <arschmitz> They were hoping for a list of what are potential concerns / thoughts were about bem before the call
[10:47:52] <arschmitz> so they could have an idea what are thoughts were going in
[10:48:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i think your big concern was maintainability right?
[10:48:51] <arschmitz> that it leads to out of control files that seem hard to maintain
[10:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, Jasper's early BEM implementation seemed like it was massively larger than conventional implementations, making it nearly impossible to maintian.
[10:51:15] <sfrisk> I could create a google doc of concerns that people can add to? Or we could add the notes to the agenda
[10:51:39] <arschmitz> Google doc would be nice so people that are not here could add to it after the meeting notes are sent
[10:52:23] <sfrisk> okay, put that on my list of things to do
[10:52:40] <sfrisk> I'll send the link out of everyone after the meeting
[10:52:48] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:53:10] <sfrisk> We have 8 minutes left, so I think that gives us enough time to discuss performance testing and browser support?
[10:54:07] <arschmitz> yeah we really need this setup
[10:54:26] <arschmitz> but still no word as far as i have heard from Kris or Brian
[10:54:29] <sfrisk> Performance Testing we're still waiting on input
[10:54:50] <arschmitz> kborchers: you had mentioned that you talked to them at chrome dev summit right?
[10:54:56] <sfrisk> does someone want to ping them directly and ask them to post something in the issue?
[10:55:38] <arschmitz> I can get ahold of Kristofer for sure Brian some one else would have to
[10:55:57] <arschmitz> i dont know him
[10:57:14] <kborchers> yeah they said they were going to be working on it last week
[10:57:27] <arschmitz> ok
[10:58:18] <sfrisk> okay, sounds good
[10:58:24] <sfrisk> maybe follow up and see what's up?
[10:58:50] <sfrisk> and on the final note in our last two minutes, browser support
[10:59:07] <sfrisk> Specifically, our favorite browser set ever, IE
[10:59:42] <kborchers> i just pinged them so we'll see what they say
[10:59:49] <sfrisk> awesome, thank you
[11:00:06] <arschmitz> cool
[11:00:44] <sfrisk> right now in the issue there is a discussion if out of the box we want to support IE9+ or IE10+, with suggestions on how to support IE8+, or if we should just accept IE will be here for awhile I support IE8+
[11:01:26] <sfrisk> downside to supporting older browsers is we can't use things like flex-box, however on the other hand IE8 is still used more than we care to admit, so it may not be wise to completely ignore tham for version 1.0
[11:01:41] <sfrisk> bah, it's two
[11:01:49] <sfrisk> maybe bring up browser support in the beginning of the next meeting
[11:02:14] <sfrisk> right after we announce what the vote is for the name.
[11:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have things we plan on using flex-box for?
[11:02:52] <arschmitz> i think the consensus has been we cant yet no matter what
[11:02:58] <sfrisk> you could use it to make a pretty awesome grid system that doesn't require all the extra divs
[11:03:06] <arschmitz> the support is not even fully there in IE 10 even
[11:03:10] <sfrisk> but support isn't really there for older browsers
[11:03:31] <sfrisk> maybe version 2.0 (I can dream)
[11:04:29] <arschmitz> yeah it seems like it might be possible in the semi near future but not realistic for V1
[11:05:14] <sfrisk> so should 1.0 support IE8? or should we do IE9+ with the suggestion of how to get everything to work in 8?
[11:05:33] <arschmitz> im very torn on this
[11:06:30] <sfrisk> @jobot01_, any opinion?
[11:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Any guess on when core will drop dupport for IE8?
[11:06:38] <arschmitz> i have conflicting interest in that we want to use this for ui and mobile which currently support 8 but this is not ruled strictly by the needs of those in anyway
[11:06:55] <DaveMethvin> do what's right for CSS
[11:07:02] <DaveMethvin> i suspect we'll support IE8 for a while
[11:07:03] <DaveMethvin> but that doesn
[11:07:11] <DaveMethvin> t mean other projects need to do that
[11:07:17] <DaveMethvin> we're at the bottom of the stack
[11:07:25] <arschmitz> honestly though
[11:07:29] <sfrisk> we could do a graceful degrade for IE8.  Like we don't give them gradients, just a solid background color.
[11:07:45] <arschmitz> i think if we want the broadest adoption possible
[11:07:47] <sfrisk> the only real issue IE8 should have a major problem with is media-queries
[11:07:50] <arschmitz> we need to support ie8
[11:08:09] <DaveMethvin> so right now ie8 is somewhere around 10% of all the web?
[11:08:14] <arschmitz> we can recomend respond.js for that its not perfect but it gets the job done
[11:08:15] <sfrisk> I think so
[11:08:24] <arschmitz> thats pretty major amoutn
[11:08:37] <DaveMethvin> but again most of that is probably legacy old corp browsers? are they expecting to be consumers of this hot new stuff?
[11:08:41] <sfrisk> We're still required to support it for all government websites
[11:08:54] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: consumers no viewers yes
[11:09:02] <DaveMethvin> ie11 has an ie8 jail for old apps that doesn't affect the internet
[11:09:25] <DaveMethvin> so if companies config their browsers right they can have ie8 for their old stuff but not break new stuff
[11:09:51] <arschmitz> i think i saw over 75% of blackfriday purchases were from desktop computers people surf a lot on their terrible old work computers
[11:09:54] <DaveMethvin> how does the need for IE8 support affect decisions?
[11:10:08] <joebot01_> that was my question as well
[11:10:13] <DaveMethvin> is it divs+classes vs flexbox/grid?
[11:10:24] <DaveMethvin> or is it minor stuff like gradients?
[11:10:28] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: no flexbox is no go almost no matter what
[11:10:29] <DaveMethvin> that degrate pretty well
[11:10:29] <sfrisk> with IE8, it's more media querries
[11:10:43] <arschmitz> and yeah stupid stuff like gradient shadow corners
[11:10:54] <sfrisk> and all the fancy css3 stuff
[11:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> What happens when the browser doesn't support media queries?
[11:11:01] <arschmitz> that most projects including ui and mobile just say oh well to and just use them anyway
[11:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> Do all the rules get applied or just the ones outside the queries?
[11:11:11] <DaveMethvin> is it okay for it to look ugly as long as it works? i'd say so
[11:11:17] <sfrisk> if you're not using something like respond.js, your site won't apply any of the media querries
[11:11:20] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: just outside
[11:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds fine for IE8 then.
[11:11:29] <sfrisk> so, for example, if you built your site with the default styles being mobile
[11:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> It'll just get small device styling, right?
[11:11:37] <arschmitz> yes
[11:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds fine.
[11:11:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:11:46] <sfrisk> and adding the desktop/tablet stylings on top that, IE8 defaults to mobile view
[11:11:54] <arschmitz> and respond.js is well established and adds media queries to ie8
[11:11:57] <DaveMethvin> don't bend over backwards for ie8 iow
[11:12:02] <arschmitz> its from scott jehel / filament
[11:12:21] <arschmitz> so if people want they can use it though i would never bundle it or anything
[11:13:10] <arschmitz> othen then fancy css3 stuff and media queries i dont think it really poses any other issues
[11:13:15] <sfrisk> Could just have a link with the note "Need to support IE8?  Here ya go"
[11:13:22] <sfrisk> and link to respond.js
[11:13:27] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:13:43] <arschmitz> we used to do that on mobile because we have some responsive stuff
[11:13:53] <sfrisk> IE8 does have have the ability to do gradients, just not through css3, but through a filter
[11:14:11] <arschmitz> yeah a lot of the css 3 stuff you can do with filters
[11:14:25] <sfrisk> so we could either support css3 stuff in IE8 with filters
[11:14:38] <sfrisk> or be like "nope, you'll just get a plain version of the site, and not the fancy things"
[11:14:55] <arschmitz> honestly though is it even likely we will use gradients much? they tend to be very slow and not used very much any more
[11:15:11] <sfrisk> only time I really see them lately is occasionally on buttons
[11:15:32] <arschmitz> the new ui theme removes them
[11:15:40] <arschmitz> mobile removed them in 1.4
[11:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'd think that can be a module that tacks on filter support via Sass.
[11:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't need to be done by us even.
[11:16:10] <arschmitz> yeah it does not seem like something worth worrying about to me
[11:16:20] <sfrisk> okay then
[11:16:27] <sfrisk> so IE8+ for version 1 then
[11:16:32] <sfrisk> ?
[11:16:40] <sfrisk> with the link to respond.js for full support
[11:16:44] <arschmitz> i think that makes sense with current market shares
[11:17:22] <arschmitz> and the only thing to really worry too much about with ie8 is not that it looks EXACTLY the same but that its just not broken lol
[11:17:36] <arschmitz> like you cant fall back from flexbox but missing corners who cares
[11:18:03] <arschmitz> if your using ie8 your probably used to missing gradients and corners and shadows
[11:18:12] <sfrisk> definitely
[11:18:13] <sfrisk> okay, on that note, I've held this meeting almost 20 past its allotted time, so I'm gonna say the meeting should probably be over now.
[11:18:39] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats any of the stuff on the agenda that really needs discussion right now
[11:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks sfrisk. Hopefully we'll get more people attending future meetings.
[11:19:16] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[11:19:22] <sfrisk> Definitely! I think this week was just tough being right after vacation.
[11:19:42] <arschmitz> sfrisk: you can email the meeting notes to the original email list
[11:19:49] <sfrisk> I'll send out an email with meeting notes, set up a vote, and a google doc for people to reaise their concerns on BEM
[11:19:55] <arschmitz> and remind them all that we now have meetings every tuesday
[11:19:56] <sfrisk> sounds good, arschmitz
[11:20:01] <sfrisk> Will do
[11:21:05] <sfrisk> See everyone next week
