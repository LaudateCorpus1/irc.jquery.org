[10:00:12] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[10:01:02] <sfrisk> arschmitz, arthurvr, kristyjy
[10:01:23] <kristyjy> hello
[10:01:26] <sfrisk> I know geekman-rohit was busy today
[10:02:06] <arschmitz> hi
[10:02:29] <sfrisk> arthurvr might be away too
[10:02:39] <sfrisk> So this may be a tiny group today
[10:03:43] <sfrisk> Agenda of Agenda-ness: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:04:03] <sfrisk> Please add your name to the attending list
[10:04:45] <sfrisk> Okay so first up is the performance testing PRs that have been sitting in there for awhile.
[10:05:11] <sfrisk> Now that arschmitz has done that work on grunt/variables/etc, I believe those should be good to pull in now?
[10:05:18] <arschmitz> no
[10:05:20] <arschmitz> not at all
[10:05:23] <sfrisk> ok
[10:05:32] <sfrisk> I thought we were waiting to pull those in for the build work to be completed
[10:05:33] <arschmitz> there is a ton of work to be done still
[10:05:42] <arschmitz> it depended on that being done first
[10:05:57] <arschmitz> if some one else wants to work on it they are welcome i dont see me getting to it any time soon
[10:06:02] <sfrisk> Okay, I was under the impression that stuff you worked on in the jsass commit was going to deal with it
[10:06:22] <sfrisk> I'll see if geekman-rohit is interested, it might be up his alley and it's his PRs that are dependent on it
[10:06:42] <sfrisk> What is the exact scope of work that needs to get done for the performance PR
[10:06:54] <arschmitz> well we need to use local files not remote
[10:07:03] <arschmitz> we need to write tests that actually test what we want
[10:07:26] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/60
[10:07:38] <arschmitz> we need to have a way to run them where the enviroment will be consistent
[10:08:05] <arschmitz> so the results actually mean something
[10:08:42] <arschmitz> we need to make this work with the chassis demos some how and integrate it into our CI
[10:09:31] <sfrisk> Okay, in that case, I think we should expand issue #60 to include those goals
[10:10:15] <sfrisk> and update the issue
[10:10:39] <arschmitz> well they are kinda all different issues but we can make it one giant meta issue if we want
[10:11:08] <sfrisk> well we could create a big issue with the smaller issues to check off
[10:11:33] <sfrisk> similar to what we did with accordion in mobile
[10:12:16] <arschmitz> one small difference is that these can all be fixed one at a time independant of each other
[10:12:49] <arschmitz> local files is seperate from new tests is seperate from enviroment is seperate from ci etc
[10:13:05] <arschmitz> they dont even need to be fixed in a specfic order
[10:13:12] <arschmitz> they are completely independant issues
[10:13:23] <sfrisk> Well then I can create separate issues for it
[10:13:46] <arschmitz> that way if someone wants to fix local files but not the rest they can tackle just that issue
[10:14:06] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:14:55] <sfrisk> Well parts of that should be pretty easy to tackle if someone has free time
[10:15:05] <sfrisk> Onto the topic of Build Related PRs
[10:15:06] <arschmitz> yup
[10:15:33] <sfrisk> last week we decided aruthur's fix was good (make jscs and jshint lint grunt files)
[10:15:51] <sfrisk> there is just a minor merge conflict (a semi colin I think), I'll fix that and merge it in
[10:16:40] <sfrisk> The other three PRs in that group, the people involved aren't actually here today
[10:17:01] <sfrisk> So if you have any concerns, bring it up in those PRs
[10:17:24] <sfrisk> I think geekman-rohit had a question for you arschmitz on https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/105
[10:18:12] <arschmitz> He also asked in PM and i answered him 7 days ago
[10:18:19] <sfrisk> Oh, okay
[10:18:27] <sfrisk> well that wasn't recorded on the issue so I wasn't sure
[10:20:20] <sfrisk> so what was the answer?
[10:20:36] <arschmitz> that fix should not be true in the repo
[10:20:54] <sfrisk> So geekman-rohit needs to update the pr to have fix be false
[10:21:05] <arschmitz> it should just not be there at all
[10:21:20] <sfrisk> I'll add a note for him to remove that then before I land this issue
[10:23:50] <sfrisk> I haven't had a chance to check out Build: add accessibility testing, but I intend to later today
[10:25:44] <sfrisk> half the people a lot of these PRs are related too couldn't actually make it today :-(
[10:26:06] <sfrisk> now that the build is fixed, I'm going to merge it into the buttons PR
[10:26:26] <sfrisk> so buttons uses jsass for the variables
[10:26:40] <sfrisk> also kristyjy submitted the PR for style guide
[10:27:00] <kristyjy> yay I'm true to my word :)
[10:27:17] <sfrisk> I know arschmitz has already started reviewing
[10:27:17] <kristyjy> I'll read over the comments soon and put in the fixes later this week
[10:27:36] <sfrisk> I'll do a more in depth review later today
[10:29:09] <kristyjy> I have stand up to go to now but I'll read the chat when I get back in about 10 minutes
[10:30:39] <sfrisk> I might just end now
[10:30:51] <sfrisk> most of what I had left to discuss involves people not actually here
[10:32:28] <sfrisk> Unless anyone has any objections?
[10:34:50] <sfrisk> Right then, meeting done. See everyone on css-chassis/in the issues
[10:35:09] <sfrisk> Please review the Agenda though, everyone - I have a list of the PRs on there that need reviewing
