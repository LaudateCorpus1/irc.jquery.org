[12:01:33] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz awayrxaviers fnagel jzaefferer mikesherov_
[12:01:44] <arschmitz> we need to hire a new bot lol
[12:03:20] <fnagel> hey
[12:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> Please bear with me as I get the agenda ready.
[12:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I saw a lot of activity related to datepicker, but I haven't had a chance to look over any of it yet.
[12:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Can you give an overview of what's going on?
[12:08:49] <fnagel> Added quite some a11y fixes but within the old code base. JÃ¶rn did already review this once.
[12:09:26] <fnagel> To finalize a11y we would need to stablize the specs first
[12:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean "within the old code base"?
[12:10:09] <fnagel> I think I will try to talk with Jon Gunderson
[12:10:24] <fnagel> No changes to match the wiki specs added by Jon
[12:10:44] <fnagel> I only improved and fixed the existing keboard controls, focus handling, etc
[12:11:03] <jzaefferer> Yeah, would be good to talk to Jon.
[12:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[12:11:25] <jzaefferer> If all he does it copy and paste from other specs, its not of much help
[12:11:28] <fnagel> The specs proposed by Jon have some flaws (no hints how to handle mulitple calendars, some questions in general, ...)
[12:11:39] <jzaefferer> the current PR is definitely a big improvement on the focus handling
[12:11:40] <fnagel> Thats what it seems to be atm
[12:13:01] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Do you know about the free-aria mailing list?
[12:13:02] <fnagel> Focus handling for example is different to what we have now (focus the grid, not the element), same for keyboard control (arrow down to focus grid after input gains focus)
[12:13:07] <fnagel> yes
[12:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> You could ask on there.
[12:13:52] <fnagel> I guess its better to ask for a review when we have something more similar to the official specs
[12:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> Bryan Garaventa might have good feedback.
[12:14:14] <fnagel> I would assume the feedback right now would be too much and copy & paste hints
[12:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, Bryan doesn't seem to care about spec compliance too much.
[12:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> He's much more pragmatic.
[12:14:34] <fnagel> Sounds good
[12:15:05] <jzaefferer> fnagel: I just responded to your last comment on the PR, seemed like we were talking about different things there
[12:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> On multiple occasions, I've seen him suggest ignoring ARIA spec completely and doing something else.
[12:15:26] <fnagel> How to conatct him? Via the mailing list?
[12:15:47] <fnagel> jzaefferer: Ok, will take a look later on.
[12:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just post on the list and see if he responds.
[12:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> If not, we can ping him directly.
[12:18:20] <fnagel> Ok. Think first step would be to contact Jon, ask him for some clearification and improvements on the docs, talk about that outcome with the team, implement and test it and then ask for feedback on the list
[12:18:22] <jzaefferer> fnagel: is it feasible to focus multiple grids at once for the multi-month calendar?
[12:19:45] <fnagel> jzaefferer: Thought about that too, but wanted to wait for some reliable specs for this before investing time
[12:20:19] <jzaefferer> okay
[12:20:31] <fnagel> Thing is, proposed spec say "focus the element" not the grid -- but I'm not sure about that one
[12:21:42] <fnagel> As I said, specs need some love before changing more of a11y stuff -- for now, the obvious flaws of the current implementation should be fixed.
[12:22:02] <fnagel> In the meantime I could implement the classes option or pick some other stuff from the todo list
[12:22:54] <jzaefferer> I think you can address the first issue I pointed out on the PR, where moving focus from the grid to the prev button closes the datepicker
[12:23:13] <jzaefferer> I don't think there's anything to discuss there, that's just a bug in the current implementation
[12:23:28] <jzaefferer> then we can merge this and continue in other areas while ARIA spec is worked out
[12:24:01] <jzaefferer> the focus issue on multi-month calendar doesn't prevent keyboard navigation
[12:24:43] <fnagel> Ok, I will test and give feedback in the PR.
[12:25:17] <jzaefferer> Is this, from the wiki page, old or new? "Like other widgets, the date picker widget receives focus by tabbing into it. Once focus is received,focus is repositioned on today's date in a grid of days and weeks"
[12:26:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did you get around to doing a test release for 1.12?
[12:27:41] <fnagel> jzaefferer: New as in "added by Jon (lateley)"
[12:28:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yes, you reviewed the CDN output, remember?
[12:28:27] <fnagel> jzaefferer: Does this answer your question? It's one of the sentences I related ro earlier
[12:29:29] <jzaefferer> yeah, thanks
[12:29:33] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: oops, right
[12:30:43] <jzaefferer> so once we can deploy 1.12 site content, we can release the beta?
[12:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> So, speaking of the site...
[12:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> Adam and I looked into the issue last week.
[12:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> The reason the deploys were running but the site wasn't updating is because it was deploying to the wrong site.
[12:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> err....wrong server
[12:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently a new server was set up, but the configs were never updatd.
[12:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> So Adam fixed that.
[12:32:56] <scott_gonzalez> And then we hit the bigger problem.
[12:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> WordPress 4.4 broke node-wordpress.
[12:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> I tracked it down to this change: https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress/commit/d763eb80b7bb354fc02bf6b257e539d517f69351
[12:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm working through the issue, but now that we know the problem, we should be able to fix it.
[12:36:59] <jzaefferer> at least it seems like a rather small change in WordPress, so hopefully not too complicated to address
[12:37:30] <jzaefferer> but then there are no tests, so who knows what will break next
[12:39:17] <jzaefferer> I got to go
[12:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> wiat
[12:40:24] <scott_gonzalez> Can you stay for a few more minutes?
[12:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> Guess not.
[12:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> I want to discuss dropping IE 8 support in 1.12
[12:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> Because the release got pushed back so far with the deployment issues.
[12:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> At this point, we won't get to a stable release before mid-January.
[12:43:43] <fnagel> Seems we are alone, Scott :-D
[12:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess we can try to discuss this tomorrow in -dev.
[12:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> What are your thoughts fnagel?
[12:45:07] <fnagel> Not sure, I still need to address IE8 quite often. What are our options?
[12:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Drop in 1.12 or drop in 1.13.
[12:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> Microsoft officially drops support in January.
[12:48:59] <fnagel> I would second keep it another round in, even if MS drops support in Jan.
[12:49:12] <fnagel> When is 1.13 estimated?
[12:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> Whenever it's ready.
[12:49:36] <fnagel> hehe
[12:49:36] <fnagel> ok
[12:50:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess that's all for today.
[12:51:03] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[13:00:57] <agcolom> hello, sorry just arrived...

[13:04:11] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you for the shout out though, it's very appreciated.
[13:04:21] <kswedberg> you bet
[13:05:12] <kswedberg> hey, about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/374...
[13:05:51] <kswedberg> seems like there are still some issues with the width / padding / negative margins at various breakpoints.
[13:06:38] <kswedberg> AurelioDeRosa: I was thinking merging in your PR and then doing some more work on top of it before pushing. would that be cool with you?
[13:07:06] <AurelioDeRosa> Absolutely! As I wrote in the PR, it partially fixes the issues
[13:07:14] <AurelioDeRosa> Feel free to improve it
[13:07:29] <kswedberg> ok, cool. thx. I'll try to get to it soon then.
[13:07:59] <agcolom> Brilliant!!!
[13:08:21] <AurelioDeRosa> Anne I left a message for you in https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/842
[13:08:54] <agcolom> Yes huge thanks Aurelio for your hard work!
[13:09:11] <agcolom> Oh, I missed your message offering to take care of it!
[13:09:21] <agcolom> yes, pretty busy here with end of year
[13:09:35] <agcolom> so I will not have time before the xmas break
[13:09:51] <AurelioDeRosa> That's fine Anne. Do you want me to take care of it?
[13:09:57] <agcolom> so if you get a chance to do anything before that yes, that would be fantastic!
[13:10:07] <AurelioDeRosa> Cool. I'm assigning it to me
[13:10:24] <agcolom> Thank you! That's great team work :-)
[13:11:04] <AurelioDeRosa> There's a small PR waiting for a review https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/852
[13:11:50] <AurelioDeRosa> I think I'll be able to close 3-4 issues before the end of the week + 3 PRs, so the count will go down
[13:12:17] <agcolom> yay :-)
[13:12:20] <kswedberg> AurelioDeRosa: I just gave it a LGTM
[13:12:31] <agcolom> Yes, +1 :-)
[13:12:48] <kswedberg> so, feel free to merge. :)
[13:14:14] <AurelioDeRosa> lovely
[13:14:40] <agcolom> now regarding the https issues, do we know what the status is?
[13:15:07] <AurelioDeRosa> Who was dealing with it? Arthur?
[13:15:11] <agcolom> yes.
[13:15:25] <agcolom> he's busy at the moment with end of year exams
[13:15:53] <agcolom> I think he may get some time over the xmas break as well...
[13:16:06] <agcolom> so I'll keep this in the notes for now..
[13:16:15] <AurelioDeRosa> I'd say so.
[13:16:42] <agcolom> ok. so that was it from me... do you have anything else you'd like to discuss?
[13:17:07] <kswedberg> nothing here
[13:17:21] <AurelioDeRosa> Not really
[13:17:38] <AurelioDeRosa> I'm going to merge the PR that are ready and then work on your PR, Anne
[13:17:44] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you for all your reviews
[13:18:00] <AurelioDeRosa> Do we have another meeting before Xmas?
[13:18:39] <kswedberg> thanks, AurelioDeRosa !
[13:19:01] <kswedberg> No, I don't think we have another meeting. So, happy xmas, you two!
[13:19:03] <agcolom> No, it's every 2 weeks so that takes us to the 28th
[13:19:15] <agcolom> yes happy xmas to you both :-)
[13:19:43] <agcolom> I'll be away as well for 2 weeks so shall we say no meeting on the 28th and back 2 weeks after that?
[13:20:03] <AurelioDeRosa> I think it's much better as I'll be in Italy
[13:20:09] <AurelioDeRosa> with my famiy
[13:20:27] <AurelioDeRosa> I wish you both a merry Christmas then. See you next year!
