[11:03:41] <toddparker> hey all
[11:03:52] <kinblas> toddparker: hey
[11:03:54] <toddparker> the jQuery Mobile team meeting will be starting in a minute
[11:03:58] <toddparker> key kinblas
[11:04:05] <toddparker> roll call!
[11:05:06] <kinblas> I'm here
[11:05:32] <toddparker> _nickel gseguin scottjehl
[11:05:33] <scottjehl> heyyy
[11:05:55] <toddparker> hey scottjehl
[11:06:07] <toddparker> so i know you need to run so you want to doa  quick check-in
[11:06:10] <scottjehl> reporting live from dConstruct
[11:06:23] <toddparker> BTW - realized monday is a holiday so we need to target Tuesday or so for B3
[11:06:31] <toddparker> time flies
[11:06:35] <scottjehl> uh sure!
[11:06:44] <toddparker> we all have an extra day
[11:06:54] <toddparker> so where are you at scott?
[11:06:56] <scottjehl> okay. Yeah - should have some time to get things squared by then
[11:07:02] <toddparker> cool, whew
[11:07:26] <_nickel> heyo
[11:07:34] <scottjehl> k so I've got that pagebeforechange trigger pretty good locally. The code change is minor, building a demo for it is the part I've yet to finish
[11:07:51] <scottjehl> pretty much the same demo as the other branch though - the first attempt at this
[11:07:58] <scottjehl> so as a recap:
[11:09:00] <scottjehl> in order to support more data-driven approaches to page creation, we're going to trigger the beforechangepage event in such a way that you can bind to it and preventDefault()
[11:09:53] <scottjehl> if you do, we do not continue with changepage handling, instead allowing the end developer to handle it themselves by creating a page from data, depending on the URL being requested, and calling changePage again to open that new page
[11:10:17] <scottjehl> works well, very small change on our end
[11:10:27] <scottjehl> tricky part is making a demo that doesn't throw C-Grade under a bus
[11:10:32] <scottjehl> :) so, almost done
[11:10:59] <toddparker> cool
[11:11:08] <toddparker> and i pasted that right into the blog post :)
[11:11:12] <scottjehl> ios5 - have not had time to do that yet
[11:11:15] <toddparker> two birds, one stone
[11:11:18] <scottjehl> keep the bus part :)
[11:11:22] <scottjehl> hah
[11:11:41] <toddparker> ok
[11:11:41] <toddparker> well, might as well finish this up and we can have you focus solely on that iOS things after
[11:12:00] <toddparker> great scott
[11:12:17] <toddparker> (said that with an english accent BTW)
[11:12:28] <toddparker> ok scott, anything esle?
[11:12:28] <scottjehl> sure. Monday should be adequate
[11:12:38] <_nickel> grrrrreyt scoot
[11:12:49] <scottjehl> umm just should mention that jQM was quite well received in today's all-day workshop
[11:12:53] <scottjehl> great work, team
[11:13:06] <toddparker> scottjehl is in London so we can all do bad british accents so he feels at home
[11:13:31] <scottjehl> I walked everyone through this jqm app http://scottjehl.com/dconstruct/code/FlipPics-5-final/
[11:13:31] <toddparker> think we need to educate on how cool ajax nav is, even standalone from the mobile widgets
[11:13:37] <scottjehl> k that's about it from me
[11:13:44] <toddparker> ok thanks scott!
[11:13:45] <scottjehl> yep - people were really into that idea
[11:14:10] <toddparker> can we share that URL now?
[11:14:29] <scottjehl> yep already tweeted
[11:14:30] <toddparker> (hey _nickel)
[11:14:33] <toddparker> cool
[11:14:35] <scottjehl> smashingmag picked it up
[11:14:38] <toddparker> RT from jQM?
[11:14:40] <scottjehl> boom
[11:14:40] <toddparker> nice
[11:14:44] <scottjehl> will do now!
[11:14:46] <toddparker> so we're covered
[11:14:54] <toddparker> cool
[11:15:00] <toddparker> so kinblas
[11:15:04] <toddparker> on transitions
[11:15:10] * kinblas sighs
[11:15:18] <toddparker> i'm out tomorrow so i wont have access to all the lab gadgets
[11:15:20] <kinblas> I sent a plea for help to google today
[11:15:21] <toddparker> tho i may take a few
[11:15:25] <toddparker> heh, good
[11:15:32] <toddparker> we need some contacts there
[11:15:34] <kinblas> we'll see what they say
[11:15:37] <toddparker> ok
[11:15:40] <toddparker> re: honeycomb
[11:15:48] <toddparker> blinks
[11:15:55] <kinblas> So I've been experimenting with different approaches to stop blinking
[11:16:07] <gseguin> hey
[11:16:09] <kinblas> latest approach works most times, but is wonky
[11:16:27] <kinblas> toddparker: I pushed it public so you can try it on Galaxy tab
[11:16:57] <kinblas> basic approach is to push off-screen (versus display:none) and leave the transition classes on the thing pushed off screen
[11:17:09] <kinblas> so in my experimentation
[11:17:22] <kinblas> I found that changing display, visibility, and removing tranforms
[11:17:30] <kinblas> from an element will cause a flash
[11:18:16] <kinblas> hence the leaving of the transition classes ... I know that in theory that is bad ... given the fact that folks can actually have rules they don't want to stay in effect
[11:18:28] <kinblas> but at this point I'm grasping at straws, hence the plea to google
[11:18:56] <toddparker> gotcha
[11:19:13] <toddparker> so is this a link i should test today if i can against latest?
[11:19:15] <kinblas> so at this point I'm tempted to take a break and try and fix other bugs
[11:19:20] <toddparker> sure
[11:19:22] <kinblas> toddparker: yes!
[11:19:27] <kinblas> I'll send it to you in dev
[11:19:46] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[11:19:50] <toddparker> happy to help
[11:20:15] <toddparker> does this version have the transform trick to try and hide the scroll
[11:20:21] <toddparker> or is that another can of worms
[11:20:27] <kinblas> no
[11:20:39] <scottjehl> let's not go there
[11:20:40] <toddparker> i hope scott gets far with the iOS5 stuff and it looks good
[11:20:41] <scottjehl> heh
[11:20:55] <toddparker> b/c i think that will be the true path to smoothness
[11:21:17] <toddparker> seems like no matter what we do in the current approach, it's not going to get much better than master
[11:21:18] <kinblas> toddparker: Not sure that will help android
[11:21:29] <toddparker> it will once they support overflow
[11:21:32] <toddparker> no?
[11:21:45] <kinblas> toddparker: not unless the fix transitions
[11:21:54] <toddparker> we can make android a c-grade platform
[11:21:58] <toddparker> problem solved :)
[11:22:01] <kinblas> heh
[11:22:10] <toddparker> oh, well that's a bummer
[11:22:16] <kinblas> unfortunately folks are turning off transitions
[11:22:18] <toddparker> but this is honeycomb-only
[11:22:19] <kinblas> on Android
[11:22:27] <toddparker> or older android?
[11:22:44] <scottjehl> gotta run guys, catch you soon!
[11:22:45] <kinblas> toddparker: I dont have any tablet running 2.x
[11:23:03] <kinblas> toddparker: it would be good to see if things flash excessively there too.
[11:23:21] <kinblas> toddparker: we may not be seeing flashes due to the small nature of the screen size on the smartphone
[11:23:34] <gseguin> are there any tablet running 2.x?
[11:23:46] <kinblas> toddparker: in general, the problems I see on smartphone Android is bad frame-rates
[11:24:19] <kinblas> gseguin: I thought Todd had a nook
[11:24:29] <kinblas> gseguin: runnint 2.x
[11:25:17] <kinblas> Also, there are some fundamental flaws with trying to use transitions for this stuff
[11:25:20] <toddparker> nook color
[11:25:35] <toddparker> lots of junky 7" tablets running 2.1 and 2.2 on sale now
[11:25:44] <toddparker> nook is 2.2
[11:25:46] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:26:13] <kinblas> specifically, when writing a generic page transition handler that just places classes on elements
[11:26:38] <kinblas> we're not supposed to care what those classes are triggering
[11:26:50] <kinblas> but we can't really tell for sure when a transition is done
[11:27:12] <kinblas> due to the fact that the browser will fire a transitionend event for *EVERY* property that is transitioning
[11:27:32] <toddparker> ugh
[11:27:38] <kinblas> so if someone writes a transition that does a fade first, then a transform
[11:27:49] <kinblas> we can't really tell when things are done at such a low level
[11:27:51] <toddparker> tho could we keep this to a single property per most transitions
[11:28:02] <kinblas> toddparker: tell that to 'pop'
[11:28:06] <kinblas> which does a fade and resize
[11:28:09] <toddparker> no, you
[11:28:12] <toddparker> yeah
[11:28:15] <kinblas> I guess the point I'm making
[11:28:20] <toddparker> tho maybe we could get away with not fading
[11:28:21] <kinblas> is that we're setting ourselves up for
[11:28:26] <toddparker> if it smoothes this out a lot
[11:28:32] <kinblas> restrctions
[11:28:42] <toddparker> yeah, that's our life innit?
[11:28:46] <kinblas> transitions can only transition a set of properties of the same duration
[11:28:57] <kinblas> and of the same start time
[11:29:05] <kinblas> (that is same delay
[11:29:17] <toddparker> but other than flip and pop, aren't we using a single property
[11:29:27] <toddparker> position or opacity
[11:29:32] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah other than that yes
[11:29:42] <kinblas> fundamental problem #2
[11:29:44] <toddparker> if we can get smoother with simpler, that may be preferrable
[11:30:05] <kinblas> and gseguin is aware of this one ... some transitions only animate one page, either the from or the to
[11:30:08] <toddparker> just looking for ways to make this better within the constraints we have
[11:30:22] <toddparker> right, like pop
[11:30:29] <toddparker> and slide up/down
[11:30:49] <kinblas> that means we have to listen to both the 'from' and 'to' transitionend
[11:31:31] <kinblas> which means we have to wait for one of the me to report back their done
[11:31:45] <gseguin> we would almost need a transition registry that defines these variables and that we keep in sync with our css
[11:31:47] <kinblas> .. correction, one of the pages to report that one of their properties is done.
[11:32:50] <toddparker> right
[11:33:16] <gseguin> and then when a user wants to register a transition he's in charge of defining these vars for his transition
[11:33:40] <toddparker> guess so, yeah
[11:33:54] <gseguin> kinblas: thoughts?
[11:33:58] <toddparker> boy, this stuff is hard
[11:34:31] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah that would make it work .... this stuff just points out how useful key-frame animations are
[11:34:32] <toddparker> i keep coming back to the fact that we do ajax nav solely for transitions, so if people are shutting them off for perf reasons...sigh
[11:34:35] <_nickel> seriously
[11:35:23] <kinblas> toddparker: people love eye candy
[11:35:27] <toddparker> they do
[11:35:28] <kinblas> end-users that is
[11:35:45] <toddparker> at this point, is it even a step up to switch to transitions
[11:36:02] <kinblas> toddparker: you tell me... you have more devices
[11:36:06] <toddparker> or is it better to try and tweak keyframes for 1.0, then re-look at thsi later
[11:36:12] <kinblas> frankly, I'm not seeing a big performance win
[11:36:18] <kinblas> and things still flash on honeycomb
[11:36:18] <toddparker> so far, no significant improvment
[11:36:41] <toddparker> but i do want to do more testing so send me your best link to compare after this meeting
[11:36:50] <toddparker> yeah, but so does master
[11:37:00] <kinblas> toddparker: ok already did in dev
[11:37:05] <toddparker> k, thanks!
[11:37:13] <toddparker> so i'll compare that to master and report back
[11:37:30] <toddparker> in the meantime, feel free to look at other bugs
[11:37:39] <toddparker> think there are some baddies floating around
[11:37:51] <_nickel> indeed there are
[11:38:10] <toddparker> was this last scroll fixed? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1774
[11:38:10] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1774 on jquery-mobile, reported by badtoto (2m, 4w ago): about lastscroll in the nightly version
[11:38:14] <toddparker> thought scott fixed this
[11:38:44] <toddparker> anyone?
[11:38:47] <toddparker> i can ask scott
[11:39:01] <_nickel> hmm not sure
[11:39:30] <toddparker> no worries
[11:39:35] <kinblas> I"m not sure either
[11:39:49] <toddparker> k
[11:39:53] <toddparker> was looking thru this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=7&sort=created&state=open
[11:40:10] <toddparker> _nickel: were you looking at this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2368
[11:40:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2368 on jquery-mobile, reported by kirk911 (1d, 2h ago): pagecreate event fire multiple times
[11:40:21] <toddparker> see you were
[11:40:23] <_nickel> yah
[11:40:33] <_nickel> that and the select menu bug
[11:40:40] <toddparker> where did we land with that select issue
[11:40:43] <_nickel> just finished etting up the CI today too
[11:40:49] <toddparker> nice
[11:40:55] <_nickel> toddparker: I have to find a fix that doesn't require making the element inlne
[11:41:18] <toddparker> such an odd issue
[11:41:27] <toddparker> tho it is a bit of an edgecase
[11:41:34] <_nickel> hmm
[11:41:38] <_nickel> well not for .NET devs
[11:41:44] <_nickel> they get one form
[11:41:46] <_nickel> and one form only
[11:41:48] <_nickel> per page
[11:42:02] <_nickel> or at least that was the case when I was rocking Visual Studio
[11:43:04] <_nickel> which is the priority I guess should be my question
[11:43:30] <toddparker> ah
[11:44:04] <toddparker> but wouldn't it still be a form inside a single page normally
[11:44:18] <toddparker> thought this was a form around multiple page divs
[11:44:19] <_nickel> one form per document
[11:44:20] <_nickel> I should say
[11:44:28] <_nickel> if you're referring to jqm pages
[11:44:44] <toddparker> but is this an artifact of the ajax nav stuffing multiplepages into the DOM
[11:44:58] <toddparker> or are they setting up a multi-page with a form wrapped aroudn all
[11:45:06] <_nickel> sorry
[11:45:24] <_nickel> which issue are we talking about
[11:45:26] <kinblas> toddparker: I think its a multi-page.
[11:45:36] <kinblas> _nickel: the select/.form one
[11:45:44] <_nickel> doesn't matter really
[11:45:50] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2066
[11:45:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2066 on jquery-mobile, reported by ryantofteland (1m, 2w ago): Select Menus won't open when pages are within FORM element
[11:45:51] <_nickel> the selects won't work on the first page
[11:46:23] <toddparker> hmmm
[11:46:33] <toddparker> unless the form is *inside* the page
[11:46:36] <toddparker> right?
[11:46:42] <_nickel> toddparker: correct
[11:46:57] <_nickel> its just that the mobile-viewport is the form in that case
[11:47:33] <_nickel> kinblas: should we just make the body the mobile viewport?
[11:47:39] <toddparker> so this is an issue with a multi-page with a form wrapped around it in Android
[11:47:40] <_nickel> would it even work if it wasn't
[11:48:01] <_nickel> toddparker: issue with a single page with a form wrapped around it in 2.2 and 2,3
[11:48:04] <kinblas> _nickel: I thought the body *WAS* the mobile viewport
[11:48:06] <_nickel> *2.3
[11:48:19] <_nickel> kinblas: its the parent of the first page from what I know
[11:48:30] <_nickel> I'd have to look though
[11:48:34] <kinblas> _nickel: right, so you are saying always make it the body?
[11:48:39] <toddparker> but it's only an issue if the nesting is reversed from our guideliens - form outside of page instead of inside
[11:48:40] <_nickel> kinblas: yes
[11:48:53] <_nickel> toddparker: yes
[11:49:12] <kinblas> _nickel: does it work if you insert an element between the overflow-x element and the position:absolute element?
[11:49:17] <toddparker> sooo
[11:49:18] <_nickel> no
[11:49:20] <_nickel> kinblas: no
[11:49:26] <_nickel> kinblas: the original example has stuff between
[11:49:30] <_nickel> fieldcontain etc
[11:49:48] <_nickel> toddparker: but that guidline means jqm won't play nice with .net
[11:49:54] <_nickel> so far as I understand it
[11:49:56] <toddparker> seems like just a nasty android bug that we may need to warn people about
[11:50:03] <toddparker> but why?
[11:50:16] <toddparker> they could serve up a single page
[11:50:18] <toddparker> even w/o the page wrapper
[11:50:27] <toddparker> and we'll wrap it for them and it will work
[11:50:50] <_nickel> what do you mean "wrap it for them"? with a form?
[11:50:52] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm assuming they are breaking the form up in to multiple digestable pages
[11:50:54] <toddparker> in .net, the form needs to be the parent for anything inside the body?
[11:50:57] <kinblas> to take advantage of the nice transitions
[11:51:16] <_nickel> toddparker: otherwise we have to tell them to just disable ajax nav
[11:51:25] <toddparker> sure, but wouldn't each page have a form insdie that submits to the next?
[11:51:49] <toddparker> couldn't rather
[11:51:51] <kinblas> toddparker: that last suggestion is a bit more work
[11:52:01] <toddparker> boo hoo :p
[11:52:09] <kinblas> btw, I'm not justifying trying to fix this
[11:52:13] <kinblas> personally I thing we punt
[11:52:31] <kinblas> why potentially break other folks to support a non-standard setup?
[11:52:33] <toddparker> i'm beginning to lean that way
[11:52:35] <_nickel> if we define the mobile viewport as the body explicitly I think it fixes the issue
[11:52:36] <toddparker> right
[11:52:51] <toddparker> but what ripples does that cause?
[11:53:00] <kinblas> _nickel: that's why I asked about the element between the overflow_x and display: none
[11:53:04] <kinblas> in that case it would be the form
[11:53:18] <kinblas> do we know for sure that would fix things?
[11:53:20] <_nickel> kinblas: it doesn't matter in the case where its the form
[11:53:31] <_nickel> kinblas: I
[11:53:42] <_nickel> kinblas: I'd have to test that my suggestion actualy works
[11:53:47] <_nickel> either way
[11:53:47] <kinblas> It would also mean that we have some places in the code that we need to modify to do a search up the hierarchy from a page to the viewport
[11:54:03] <_nickel> if you guys want to punt feel free to close those issues
[11:54:37] <kinblas> _nickel: since this is .net
[11:54:43] <toddparker> it's more of a question of whether this is a priority for B3 or 1.0, not that we won't fix
[11:54:46] <_nickel> I'm assuming it is
[11:54:55] <_nickel> toddparker: hmm
[11:54:56] <_nickel> good point
[11:55:02] <kinblas> can't they just place a form in a data-role="page" and have some widget step them through form divs (aka panels)?
[11:55:07] <toddparker> it's a legit bug
[11:55:11] <_nickel> I think we can certainly wait for 1.0 on it
[11:55:23] <toddparker> but more of an edgecase - crappy .net markup + android bug
[11:55:42] <_nickel> kinblas: .net does a ton of stuff for you to make the page behave like a winform in its communication with the server
[11:55:51] <toddparker> alright, let's table for now but if we can come up with a low-risk fix, let's do it
[11:55:52] <_nickel> all of which revolves around having a single form
[11:56:08] <_nickel> toddparker: alright I'll noodle
[11:56:12] <toddparker> k
[11:56:12] <_nickel> and focus on the pagecreate
[11:56:16] <_nickel> so
[11:56:17] <toddparker> sure
[11:56:18] <_nickel> for the pagecreate issue
[11:56:23] <toddparker> yeah
[11:56:33] <_nickel> should we be "remembering" when we've already loaded a page?
[11:56:58] <kinblas> which issue is this?
[11:57:10] <kinblas> 2368?
[11:57:27] <_nickel> kinblas: yah
[11:58:03] <toddparker> #2368
[11:58:05] <kinblas> oh so something is binding every time?
[11:58:12] <_nickel> kinblas: right
[11:58:18] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2368
[11:58:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2368 on jquery-mobile, reported by kirk911 (1d, 2h ago): pagecreate event fire multiple times
[11:58:43] <_nickel> I'm not 100% sure if he's suggesting it continues to add an extra binding or it just fires on recreate
[11:59:03] <_nickel> if its that then it just needs to be fixed
[11:59:04] <toddparker> think scott was saying that page create and beforepagecreate were the same now?
[11:59:06] <_nickel> appears to be
[11:59:08] <toddparker> something like that
[11:59:14] <_nickel> alright
[11:59:15] <_nickel> I
[11:59:20] <_nickel> I'll take a look

[12:00:51] <gseguin> I was going to reply to your comment
[12:01:04] <gseguin> but I don't think we should cancel requests
[12:01:22] <gseguin> right now we queue them
[12:02:13] <gseguin> I've taken care of the visual state
[12:03:26] <toddparker> cool, that's the important part
[12:03:28] <toddparker> thanks
[12:03:48] <toddparker> closed
[12:03:59] <gseguin> alright then that's it, will go on going through bugs
[12:04:06] <toddparker> ok, so i think we mainly have bug fixes at this point
[12:04:10] <toddparker> yep
[12:04:16] <toddparker> ok all!
[12:04:19] <gseguin> unless there is something specific you'd like me to look at
[12:04:24] <toddparker> thanks, looking good
[12:04:44] <toddparker> no, i'd like to go thru pulls and have you all looking out for issues that look serious.
[12:04:54] <toddparker> i'm going to try and get a lot of triaging done over the long weekend
[12:05:08] <toddparker> so we can zero in on anything we may have missed
[12:05:16] <gseguin> ok
[12:07:43] <gseguin> see you guys on -dev after lunch
