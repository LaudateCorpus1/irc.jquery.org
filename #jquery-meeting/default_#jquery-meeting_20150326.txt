[09:00:50] <arschmitz> `pepteam
[09:00:56] <arthurvr> hey!
[09:01:02] <arschmitz> oh bot is not here
[09:01:17] <jrossi> oh I thought you were going to say "pepteam....ASSEMBLE!"
[09:01:22] <arschmitz> darn b-ot
[09:01:29] <arschmitz> i was
[09:01:33] <arschmitz> but but let me down
[09:01:55] <arschmitz> snover is on vacation
[09:02:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: is not around
[09:02:16] <arschmitz> so im not sure there is much to talk about
[09:02:18] <arschmitz> other then
[09:02:23] <arschmitz> we win! lol
[09:02:27] * arschmitz mic drop
[09:02:38] <jrossi> haha
[09:03:11] <arschmitz> its looking good at least anyway
[09:04:05] <jrossi> the apple force event stuff looks like a possible round 2 though
[09:04:10] <jrossi> hope they don't ship it
[09:04:19] <arschmitz> yeah iv been reading up on that
[09:04:41] <jrossi> I sent mail to them on it, but haven't gotten a response :-(
[09:04:49] <arschmitz> im soooo suprised
[09:05:18] <arschmitz> apple is just so responsive :-)
[09:07:02] <arschmitz> iv been avoiding buying a new la[ptop lol but if they ship that it will force me ha ha just to be able to test properly
[09:07:46] <jrossi> i'm worried about how the coding patterns for this thing would play out in browsers that don't support it
[09:08:20] <arschmitz> yeah i can only imagine how many slides on event order this will add to patricks talk ha ha ha
[09:09:12] <jrossi> e.g. cancelling these events can cancel the click event.  so in browsers that don't support "webkitmouseforceevent" ... I can only imagine pages falling over because click fires
[09:09:38] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:10:17] <arschmitz> that could be troublesome
[09:11:37] <arschmitz> with the pressure sensative screen on the apple watch im seeing this coming to phones soon too since these seem explictly "mouse" events im wondering if we will see webkittouchforceevent
[09:17:09] <jrossi> hhmm, I may have read the click part incorrectly
[09:17:31] <jrossi> but this does now create scenarios where mousdown/mouseup happen without a click :-O
[09:18:12] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:18:50] <arschmitz> i guess im on clear on "Froce click features"
[09:19:10] <arschmitz> to me that sounds like just plain click but maybe not?
[09:19:17] <jrossi> I think it has something to do with star wars, not sure
[09:20:07] <arschmitz> is a force click going to be different then a regular one come how? my impression was they are essentially the same since there will be no mechanical one
[09:20:35] <arschmitz> so im with your first interpertation that canceling the start would also cancel click
[09:20:49] <arschmitz> or "willbegin" rather
[09:21:06] <arschmitz> but maybe im wrong
[09:22:57] <jrossi> i think it's closer to a right click type of thing
[09:23:20] <arschmitz> oh hmm
[09:24:08] <arschmitz> so i guess it will replace 2 finger click on mac
[09:24:48] <jrossi> yeah that's my guess too
[09:25:04] <arschmitz> maybe i need to drive over to the apple store ha ha
[09:25:13] <arschmitz> actually try one of these things
[09:25:35] <arschmitz> see if it gives me any insight ha ha
[09:26:09] <jrossi> i think it also is on the watch
[09:26:12] <jrossi> but i dont' think that has a browser
[09:26:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:26:28] <arschmitz> thats why im wondering if we will see it on the phone soon too
[09:26:54] <arschmitz> and will they make webkittouchforceevent because that sounds absolutely horrible
[09:27:22] <arschmitz> so many events
[09:28:13] <arschmitz> im happy they didnt try to put a browser in the watch though
[09:32:08] <jrossi> yeah
[09:32:22] <jrossi> alrighty, well i guess this "meeting" is adjourned :-)
[09:32:29] <jrossi> i gotta run in that case
[09:32:46] <arschmitz> yeah sounds good
[09:32:59] <arthurvr> Bye guys!
[11:06:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: agcolom jasperdegroot cgack sfrisk arthurvr MEETING TIME
[11:06:56] <arthurvr> Hey
[11:06:56] <arschmitz> a little late
[11:07:03] <arschmitz> and with out b-ot still
[11:07:11] <sfrisk> hiiiii
[11:07:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:07:18] <cgack> howdy
[11:07:30] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:10:48] <arschmitz> ok lets get started with 1.5-dev
[11:10:54] <arschmitz> the new branch
[11:11:21] <arschmitz> this replaces ui-1-12 with a nice clean start all rebased
[11:11:30] <arschmitz> i also just cleaned up the demos and tests
[11:12:35] <arschmitz> so we are now using the new grunt-spider for demos
[11:12:37] <jasperdegroot> oh, that's gonna be fun rebasing my ui-1-12 css branch with tons of changes in demos :/
[11:13:08] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: it was just fixing things broken from your previous updates actually
[11:13:21] <arschmitz> places wherre btn got incorrectly replaced with button
[11:13:27] <arschmitz> by your search and replace
[11:13:34] <jasperdegroot> oh ok
[11:13:35] <arschmitz> so should be fine
[11:13:59] <jasperdegroot> do we still use btn somewhere?
[11:14:12] <arschmitz> widget options like closeBtn
[11:14:24] <arschmitz> the names of demo pages
[11:14:37] <jasperdegroot> right, good catch
[11:14:39] <arschmitz> like page-dialog-no-close-button.html
[11:14:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Your new commit fails to lint.
[11:15:28] <arschmitz> bah it does not like my regex
[11:15:35] <arschmitz> even though its a string
[11:15:41] <arschmitz> need to fix that
[11:15:49] <gabriel_schulhof> I think that's /why/ it doesn't like it.
[11:15:53] <gabriel_schulhof> It doesn't know it's a regex.
[11:15:58] <arschmitz> its not
[11:16:04] <arschmitz> i need to double escape i think
[11:16:14] <arschmitz> it gets passed to new RegExp( );
[11:16:28] <arschmitz> but has to go through the command line on its way lol
[11:16:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Then it is a regex stored in a string.
[11:16:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[11:16:40] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a pile of escaping.
[11:16:40] <arschmitz> correct thats why i need to double escape
[11:16:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I'd suggest at least "\\."
[11:17:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway. Sorry to hijack the meeting.
[11:17:38] <arschmitz> no problem
[11:18:07] <arschmitz> so this also removes the crazy long every resource output
[11:18:15] <arschmitz> in the demo test it just shows errors now
[11:18:48] <gabriel_schulhof> :+1: Really awesome. We should try to stay within the travis log limit.
[11:18:52] <arschmitz> so this should also speed up travis tests
[11:19:08] <arschmitz> it reduces to just one run per jquery version like it used to be
[11:19:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Why couldn't we just add jobs for the spider?
[11:20:10] <arschmitz> what do you mean?
[11:20:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, add a job that just does the spidering, but no unit tests of any kind.
[11:20:52] <gabriel_schulhof> OTOH, we do a lot of superfluous building, so it's still good to do it with fewer jobs.
[11:20:53] <arschmitz> well for one the reduction has nothing to do with the spider
[11:21:19] <arschmitz> it has to do with less risk of failure les time waiting for builds less time re building 15 times and npm install 15 times
[11:21:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, we were running casper in every single job before. That was truly superfluous.
[11:22:14] <gabriel_schulhof> But, OKOK. I'm cool with the way things are.
[11:22:20] <arschmitz> yes thats also harder then you think to avoid
[11:22:38] <arschmitz> because we use enviroment varibles
[11:22:44] <arschmitz> it does everything once per enviroment var
[11:23:02] <arschmitz> so even if it ran on its own it would still run once per jquery
[11:23:19] <arschmitz> from what i can see we cant avoid this
[11:23:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, we can have it short-circuit for all combinations of env vars except one.
[11:24:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Though I admit this setup is really non-flexible.
[11:25:03] <arschmitz> feel free to do a pr if you have an idea
[11:25:25] <arschmitz> i tried to think of a good way to do it and i could think of one
[11:26:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I need to get through the boilerplate stuff first.
[11:26:36] <gabriel_schulhof> It's driving me nuts.
[11:27:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I have to commit one file at a time and run the whole test suite, because I dunno which file is causing failures.
[11:27:00] <arschmitz> lol ok
[11:27:19] <arschmitz> yeah i was banging my head on that redirect issue all week
[11:27:41] <arschmitz> im glad you figured it out i had pinged you a couple times early in the week for help lol
[11:27:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that was Twilight Zone-esque, seriously.
[11:28:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Sorry! My week was shot squarely through the heart by that st00pid laptop power supply failure.
[11:29:48] <arschmitz> i think it was mid failure i was looking for uou lol
[11:30:24] <gabriel_schulhof> When it rains, it pours :/
[11:30:45] <arschmitz> so i think we might be able to land the first 2 widgets for classes this week
[11:30:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyhoo - glad that's over (unless my new power supply melts), so I can get back in the saddle.
[11:31:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[11:31:08] <arschmitz> toolbar and textinput are looking good
[11:31:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Excellent!
[11:31:15] <arschmitz> maybe last round of updates
[11:31:52] <gabriel_schulhof> We still need to address that transtions failure in the git version of core.
[11:31:59] <gabriel_schulhof> So we can retain green tests.
[11:32:10] <gabriel_schulhof> ... for when these things start landing.
[11:32:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: did you look at the links i sent?
[11:32:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Not yet.
[11:32:21] <gabriel_schulhof> But I will.
[11:32:26] <gabriel_schulhof> As soon as I can.
[11:32:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Seems like a simple fix.
[11:32:39] <arschmitz> core change the return value of getAttribute
[11:32:48] <arschmitz> in some cases
[11:33:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm surprised this doesn't cause widespread breakage. Like, Web-wide.
[11:33:19] <arschmitz> however there is already talk of backing out the change becuase it broke ui too
[11:33:30] <arschmitz> so if it is indeed that which broke us that might be enough
[11:33:54] <arschmitz> however ever thing it broke in ui was questionable and got changed anyway
[11:34:06] <arschmitz> likely the same here
[11:34:11] <gabriel_schulhof> I think so. https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/55491647 - in both cases, it's git that's failing, and it's legit.
[11:34:35] <arschmitz> 100%
[11:34:39] <arschmitz> null vs undefined
[11:34:41] <arschmitz> thats the change
[11:35:12] <gabriel_schulhof> We should look at whether we want == in that case. IINM, something == null means null or undefined.
[11:36:45] <gabriel_schulhof> We already have checks like that that in two places: slider and collapsible
[11:37:02] <arschmitz> yeah its likely we are doing it wrong
[11:37:19] <arschmitz> so regardless of if core reverts we should look at these
[11:37:28] <gabriel_schulhof> /o
[11:39:57] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: any progress on icons?
[11:40:26] <jasperdegroot> well, what shall I say ... ;)
[11:40:37] <jasperdegroot> the css changes are not that big
[11:40:42] <jasperdegroot> problem is the demos
[11:41:09] <jasperdegroot> those are broken for many reason, not just icons, so it's hard to test if icons look good
[11:41:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Would it be possible to fix the demos on 1.5-dev and then make a PR on top of that?
[11:41:39] <jasperdegroot> for example selectmenu where the icon doesn't use a span yet
[11:41:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right!
[11:41:53] <gabriel_schulhof> All the widget PRs need to land.
[11:41:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Dang!
[11:42:08] <gabriel_schulhof> NM.
[11:42:30] <jasperdegroot> I think it's best to just do a PR for the CSS changes I have so far and assume they are ok
[11:42:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i would not worry about the demos
[11:42:38] <arschmitz> those should be updated as part of the widget prs
[11:42:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: that would be great
[11:42:58] <arschmitz> its the css im concerned with not the demos
[11:43:16] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: well, a lot of icon markup needs to be updated too
[11:43:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats fine
[11:43:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, but the fact that our PRs haven't landed yet is rendering jasperdegroot's work untestable. Did I understand correctly, jasperdegroot?
[11:43:38] <arschmitz> each widget has a pr that needs to do most of that
[11:43:42] <jasperdegroot> some things we need to look into
[11:43:58] <jasperdegroot> checkboxradio supports iconpos
[11:44:25] <jasperdegroot> but text left and then an icon next to (iconpos right) looks bad on a full width button
[11:44:28] <arschmitz> yeah thats just plain deprecated
[11:44:36] <jasperdegroot> is it already?
[11:44:38] <arschmitz> with out backcompat
[11:44:59] <arschmitz> yup it will not be support at all in future versions so we are not going to offer backcompat
[11:45:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, wasn't iconpos deprecated in 1.4, even?
[11:45:10] <jasperdegroot> ok, problem solved
[11:45:10] <arschmitz> ui is doing the same thing for multiple icons
[11:45:15] <jasperdegroot> same for selectmenu btw
[11:45:33] <arschmitz> if its just being removed keeping for another version does not ease transition it just prolongs it
[11:45:38] <jasperdegroot> and problably others like collapsible/acordion
[11:45:44] <jasperdegroot> accordion*
[11:45:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, no, that was iconshadow. NM.
[11:45:59] <arschmitz> collapsible is just deprecated without back compat
[11:46:13] <arschmitz> accordion is new and has its own api with out the need for any backcompat
[11:46:30] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:47:06] <jasperdegroot> I thought I had one other thing but I forgot, so I will ask on -dev when I remember
[11:47:26] <jasperdegroot> I'll do a PR for just css against 1.5-dev branch then
[11:47:39] <jasperdegroot> with the general button/icon CSS changes
[11:47:44] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thank you
[11:47:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: BTW: I was so crazy about that redirect, I was trying to look at the HTTP with wireshark :)
[11:47:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh speaking of
[11:48:10] <arschmitz> gibson noticed we are also breaking because of changes to promises in transitions
[11:48:17] <jasperdegroot> and when we update the demo pages for each widget I will add commits for css issues we notice after those pages are updated
[11:48:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what I thought was going on as well, but I guess it's both the undefined -> null thing /and/ that.
[11:49:19] <gabriel_schulhof> *whew* ... lots to look at.
[11:49:23] <arschmitz> yup 2 changes to core
[11:49:26] <arschmitz> 2 changes to mobile
[11:50:01] <arschmitz> timmywil: congratulations your even better at this then DaveMethvin he usually only got us with one at a time :-)
[11:50:28] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: you chose your successor wisely :-p
[11:50:34] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:51:38] <arschmitz> ok moving on any questions as far as classes or other 1.5 updates?
[11:51:58] <kapil21051> Are you guys gonna discuss about the changes jqm have after the summer code...??
[11:52:44] <arschmitz> kapil21051: im not sure what you mean but we can take any GSoC questions at the end
[11:52:50] <jasperdegroot> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=1505332384
[11:53:08] <kapil21051> okay
[11:53:19] <jasperdegroot> oh, I am actually looking at tab of last week
[11:53:38] <arschmitz> oh shhot iv been going on wrong one i forgot to copy it
[11:53:43] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: You livin' in the past, maaaan!
[11:53:43] <timmywil> arschmitz: I work to make you work
[11:53:53] <gabriel_schulhof> I gues we all are.
[11:53:55] <jasperdegroot> nice work timmy
[11:54:03] <arschmitz> timmywil: i know what would i do with out you life would be so boreing
[11:55:33] <arschmitz>  ok so BIG NEWS!!!
[11:55:39] <arschmitz> in case any one missed it
[11:55:54] <arschmitz> google reversed their position on pointer events
[11:56:20] <jasperdegroot> yeah, saw that :D
[11:56:28] <arthurvr> Amazing it is! Really good news
[11:56:53] <arschmitz> and they told us a big part of the reason was the projects like jquery were going to force use of a polyfill
[11:57:43] <arschmitz> however also right on queue apple has made an announcement making our lives potentially harder again
[11:57:53] <arschmitz> there is now a new type of click with its own set of events
[11:58:03] <arschmitz> the webkitmouseforceevents
[11:58:09] <arschmitz> and the forceclick
[11:58:19] * gabriel_schulhof rolls his eyes
[11:58:30] <arschmitz> i think steve jobs owning part of disney is finally starting to show
[11:59:10] <arschmitz> so i was curious how this worked because it did not seem to be clear so i went to the apple store and tried
[11:59:24] <arschmitz> this is a third distinct click that brings up its own special menu
[11:59:32] <arschmitz> kinda context menu like
[12:00:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Huh? "third distinct click"?
[12:00:08] <arschmitz> with stuff like directons and a map if you do it on an address
[12:00:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[12:00:17] <arschmitz> you press down it clicks
[12:00:21] <kapil21051> But how can click be of other type ?
[12:00:29] <arschmitz> you press harder it clicks "more forcefully"
[12:00:41] <arschmitz> and thats a forceclick
[12:01:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, and you press harder still, and the phone snaps in half, right? But it's all by design.
[12:01:11] <arschmitz> no this is on the laptops
[12:01:18] <kapil21051> i think in near future hover effects will work on touch mobiles too
[12:01:18] <arschmitz> its the trackpad
[12:01:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Even better!
[12:01:35] <arthurvr> Sounds stupidly irritating to work with lol
[12:01:52] <arschmitz> i force a lot fo preventDefault() lol
[12:01:55] <arschmitz> to just disable it
[12:02:02] <kapil21051> lol
[12:02:06] <kapil21051> what comes out
[12:02:29] <arschmitz> there are some compatibility concerns with these too
[12:02:46] <arschmitz> you can scroll up to the pep meeting to read more about that from jrossi1
[12:03:14] <arschmitz> so we will see where all this lands
[12:03:39] <arschmitz> i dont think i have anything else for this week
[12:03:49] <arschmitz> so gsoc questions?
[12:03:57] <kapil21051> yep..
[12:04:48] <kapil21051> if we integrate velocity API to work in jquery-mobile then do we need to provide additional support for very older browsers..??
[12:05:55] <gabriel_schulhof> That has to go into core first, right?
[12:06:16] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and core supports older browsers than we do, no?
[12:06:18] <arschmitz> kapil21051: it will either be part of core or optional
[12:06:30] <arschmitz> because it supports the core api so it can be swapped out
[12:07:59] <kapil21051> oh alright..
[12:09:11] <arschmitz> ok unless there is something else we can call it a day
[12:09:29] <kapil21051> arschmitz: Also i have updated my proposal. So if you can have a look at it.
[12:09:41] <arschmitz> kapil21051: sure i will later
[12:10:03] <kapil21051> Okay thanks..
[12:11:23] <arthurvr> Bye guys
[12:11:25] <arschmitz> see everyone back on dev
