[09:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov ngsilverman petersendidit tj_vantoll
[09:02:38] <gnarf> yeah
[09:02:42] <mikesherov> yo
[09:02:42] <kborchers> yo
[09:02:51] <mikesherov> jQuery UI: ASSEMBLE
[09:02:53] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:02:53] <bot-t> (156 hours ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell tj_vantoll that sortable bug I reponed looks like a duplicate of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4303
[09:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh, a bit old
[09:04:12] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpXM9bj-WPU
[09:04:26] <gnarf> thats the UI team
[09:04:29] <gnarf> :)
[09:04:47] <rmill> mikesherov: Can I be the penis of jQUery UI. I don't want to assemble unless I can be that part.
[09:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> I think Rafael is still travelling.
[09:05:00] <mikesherov> wow
[09:05:04] <mikesherov> wow rmill
[09:05:09] <mikesherov> YES
[09:05:11] <rmill> haha
[09:05:30] <kborchers> gnarf: i just realized … is that levar burton doing the voice over?
[09:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> We'll come back to download builder at the end in case he shows up.
[09:05:40] <gnarf> kborchers: i think so yes
[09:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get 1.10.2 out this week.
[09:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov is going to write unit tests for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8792 so we can land the PR.
[09:06:11] <gnarf> "He has also lent his voice to several animated projects including Kwame in the cartoon series Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990–1993) and The New Adventures of Captain Planet (1993–1996), Family Guy, Batman: The Animated Series, and Gargoyles. Burton is on the audio version of The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963 by Christopher Paul Curtis. Burton has been cast as voice actor for Black Lightning in Superman/Batman: Public Ene
[09:06:11] <gnarf> mies DVD.
[09:06:33] <kborchers> oh and he was kwame, nice
[09:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that, I think verifying that the theme images will be generated properly is the only other thing that needs to happen.
[09:06:39] <kborchers> good meeting all. thanks
[09:06:57] <rmill> :]
[09:07:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: there is a bug i really want fixed asap over in download builder too
[09:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Can anyone else thing of anything that should happen before 1.10.2?
[09:07:11] <gnarf> potential DOS
[09:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ok, download builder releases don't need to coincide with code releases though.
[09:07:37] <gnarf> truth
[09:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> So we can deploy that today if you've got a fix.
[09:08:02] <gnarf> i might fix it myself, was gonna let rxaviers handle it
[09:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is this the image size thing?
[09:08:15] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/117
[09:08:17] <gnarf> yeah
[09:08:19] <b-ot> gnarf: Issue #117 by gnarf37 (1w 20h ago): Limit dimensions of generated images.
[09:08:35] <gnarf> someone could request 4 images at huge sizes
[09:08:39] <gnarf> and then no more images will generate
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> Should be simple.
[09:09:05] <gnarf> depending on what i feel like my highest priority is after meetings today
[09:09:11] <gnarf> but i definitely want this fixed by next week
[09:09:36] <rmill> b-ot: Do we need to fix you too?
[09:09:36] <b-ot> rmill: reply hazy, try again.
[09:10:27] <rmill> python> import this
[09:10:30] <b-ot> rmill: The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters  Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to gue
[09:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> On Monday, we discused optional implementation.
[09:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> s/implementation/initialization/
[09:10:57] <ngsilverman> hey
[09:11:29] <scott_gonzalez> With the idea being you get much faster page loads because there's no complex JS that runs and no DOM modifications.
[09:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> And widgets "just work" even with ajax.
[09:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> But it requires users to write the full markup themselves.
[09:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> Generally this would be done by a template on the server.
[09:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll be prototyping that.
[09:12:22] <kborchers> i like it
[09:12:38] <rmill> i like YOU
[09:12:49] <kborchers> awwwwww <3
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> Kris will be working on a pointer event special event implementation.
[09:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> To polyfill Pointer Events from Mouse, Touch, MSPointer.
[09:13:18] <djQuery> anyway to have bot-t updated automagicaly with widget definitions from jqueryui
[09:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> This would be outside of jQuery UI, in its own repo.
[09:13:35] <djQuery> ?ui.widget  currently going to api.jquery
[09:13:36] <bot-t> djQuery, UI - jQuery Wiki - This is the official documentation for jQuery UI , jQuery's visual controls. jQuery UI features a wide range of core interaction plugins as well as many UI widgets . The project homepage is located... http://docs.jquery.com/UI
[09:13:53] <djQuery> lol dangit that one works
[09:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> But once we have that, we could rip out the code form ui.interaction and just use pointer events.
[09:14:07] <fnagel> sorry, Im late...
[09:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> And of course the most controversial discussion... modules.
[09:15:08] <gnarf> djQuery: stick around for the infra meeting, irc bot is a topic, scott_gonzalez if you could sneak in for that too
[09:17:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to talk to some people about what they actually want in terms of AMD and see if there's anything we can do that's sane.
[09:17:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: didn't we pretty much decide to just wrap the code on the cdn's and anything built with DB in the umd wrapper, no?
[09:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Well, we said that'd be reasonable to do, but we don't know if it actually solves the problems that AMD users care about.
[09:18:31] <kborchers> ah i see
[09:18:32] <kborchers> ok
[09:18:40] <gnarf> ajpiano: ?
[09:19:36] <ajpiano> amd users want to be able to do it to each plugin individually, not just to "jquery ui"
[09:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so I don't really want to do that.
[09:20:31] <kborchers> me neither
[09:20:50] <gnarf> could we write a custom build maker
[09:20:55] <gnarf> like lodash has
[09:21:02] <ajpiano> giving the entirely lib as one AMD thing stikres me as the thing that's insane :)
[09:21:16] <gnarf> ajpiano: its only your custom build right?
[09:21:21] <gnarf> jquery-ui.custom
[09:21:22] <gnarf> maybe
[09:21:32] <ajpiano> not really
[09:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be that and the full build on CDNs.
[09:21:47] <ajpiano> the point is i want to be able to say "this module requires datepicker, this other module requires autocomplete"
[09:21:48] <gnarf> i see the ability to do jquery.ui.dialog tho
[09:21:51] <gnarf> and have it build
[09:22:04] <gnarf> but we have some complex build logic already
[09:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, that's useful, but I don't want to use AMD to say that.
[09:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> If anything, I want ES Modules.
[09:22:20] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: you asked what AMD users want to do, not what you want to do :)
[09:22:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: so, if the choice is - one big AMD module, or no AMD support
[09:22:46] <rmill> I always liked the mootools builder
[09:22:53] <rmill> Let's just tell people to use that.
[09:23:05] <gnarf> because it seems the team doesn't like the idea of defining the amd per module
[09:23:15] <gnarf> we'd rather wait for a spec
[09:23:29] <gnarf> and let our current tools be the builders
[09:23:39] <gnarf> i think we should try to make a cli builder tho
[09:23:52] <gnarf> i used lodash's the other day, was pretty awesome
[09:24:19] <ajpiano> i'm not saying we should express our own dependencies in AMD
[09:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> If we don't express our dependencies in AMD, then what's the point of using AMD?
[09:24:56] <ajpiano> i'm saying that each module should just expose its own module, so that people who then want to express their deps in AMD
[09:24:57] <ajpiano> can do so
[09:25:02] <tj_vantoll> build-ability
[09:25:11] <ajpiano> each plugin*
[09:25:25] <tj_vantoll> You can the entire jQuery UI development source in your project.
[09:25:41] <gnarf> did you accidentally a word tj_vantoll?
[09:25:41] <tj_vantoll> And then for dependencies point at the specific widgets you're using.
[09:25:44] <gnarf> if we did use amd, we could prolly leverage some amd-building techniques
[09:25:53] <gnarf> in download building
[09:26:03] <gnarf> ui already has a amd builder
[09:26:03] <ajpiano> tj_vantoll: right - then your modules are much clearer about what parts of jquery ui they actually need
[09:26:05] <gnarf> er mobile
[09:26:21] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, and your production build is smaller.
[09:26:38] <gnarf> cc gseguin
[09:26:44] <tj_vantoll> You don't have to go through our download builder, you can have your build process do that automatically.
[09:26:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: CONTROVERSY! :)
[09:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> That seems really really stupid.
[09:26:54] <scott_gonzalez> Use shims.
[09:27:09] <ajpiano> can you elaborate on "use shims"
[09:27:20] <tj_vantoll> I'm not saying that I necessarily agree, I'm just saying that is the key argument to using AMD per plugin.  I'm on the fence.
[09:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> If we're not going to manage dependencies at all, why not just use r.js and shim each UI module?
[09:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> http://gregfranko.com/blog/registering-the-jqueryui-widget-factory-as-an-amd-module/
[09:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> The only argument there is: I can't use a CDN.
[09:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> Good. Don't.
[09:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> Problem solved.
[09:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> You've made your site better by not using a CDN.
[09:28:33] <gnarf> can we ask http://gregfranko.com/blog/registering-the-jqueryui-widget-factory-as-an-amd-module/ to source that on learn?
[09:28:56] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: shim on a per file basis does indeed make sense
[09:30:06] <ajpiano> it just makes it not work "out of the box"
[09:30:17] <tj_vantoll> Yeah agreed.  To play devil's advocate I think the argument is that you wouldn't need that shim if AMD was supported natively.
[09:30:23] <tj_vantoll> What ajpiano said.
[09:30:51] <gnarf> just a quick poll
[09:30:55] <ajpiano> essentially it's whether we want to just do the shim on a per-plugin basis inside of jquery ui
[09:31:06] <gnarf> +1 / -1 -- AMD per file in UI?
[09:31:32] <ajpiano> or say to everyone who wants to use AMD with jquery ui, ok, go set up shim configs in your requirejs config for every plugin you want to use
[09:31:32] <gseguin> +1 (did you expect anything else from me?)
[09:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> It wouldn't work "out of the box" if we didn't define our deps in AMD though.
[09:31:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we'd have to define em - we could use that in download builder tho
[09:32:00] <ajpiano> true
[09:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> Meanwhile Mobile doesn't even ship AMD per file.
[09:32:23] <ajpiano> AMD per file might not necessarily be the answer - some things might not need to expose a module
[09:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> Everything needs to expose a module.
[09:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's the whole reason we're having this discussion.
[09:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's viral in a very nasty way.
[09:33:03] <gnarf> ... and we'd rather wait for the spec
[09:33:04] <b-ot> gnarf: ratherwaitforthespec.com - ☺ AVAILABLE
[09:33:13] <gnarf> thanks b-ot
[09:33:14] <gnarf> :)
[09:33:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you should buy that
[09:33:32] <ajpiano> hmm yeah, everything that is in /ui would
[09:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> I shoudl actually buy isnotaspec.com
[09:33:54] <ajpiano> i could see bundling the effects but........
[09:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> amd.isnotaspec.com, sass.isnotaspec.com, etc.
[09:33:55] <gnarf> thats a lot of dependency definition too
[09:34:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'm for it
[09:34:06] <ajpiano> the point is like
[09:34:26] <ajpiano> the longer ui doesn't support amd, the more people who use AMD just straight up won't use ui
[09:34:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we can host it on my linode :)
[09:34:59] <gnarf> jquery-ui amd jquery.ui.widget
[09:35:06] <gnarf> builds you the amd-wrapped modules
[09:35:38] <ajpiano> i think there is a case to be made though for doing the whole lib as a simple amd wrapper, and telling people that if they want to express deps to shim everything individually
[09:35:49] <ajpiano> we still would have to explain the deps so they could include the shims
[09:35:50] <ajpiano> which we do
[09:36:36] <ajpiano> i guess i just fail to see how a bunch of deps in comments that you read and then manually interpret into shims yourself is superior to using AMD
[09:36:44] <ajpiano> except for the part where eventually there will be a real module spec
[09:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> This seems like a solved problem to me. I have yet to hear a valid complaint.
[09:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> James Burke has a tool that will wrap everything in UI with proper AMD definitions.
[09:37:28] <gnarf> can we get an article on learn about using it?
[09:37:32] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: You shouldn't use the comments to define the shims.
[09:37:41] <tj_vantoll> Worth noting that Bootstrap also doesn't support AMD https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/534.
[09:37:42] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Pull request #534 by liamks (16mon 1d ago): Added AMD to Bootstrap JS
[09:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> We have actual dependency listings in our manifests.
[09:38:00] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: right
[09:38:01] <ajpiano> my b
[09:39:01] <ajpiano> tj_vantoll: worth noting that again, there are a lot of people who do want it to :)
[09:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Worth noting also that there are a lot of people who want jQuery to support $.browser.
[09:39:48] <tj_vantoll> I definitely agree with having an officially documented means of using AMD with jQuery UI.  For those users that are convinced AMD is the way to go we can at the very least explain to them how to get it working rather than sending them to Google.
[09:40:02] <ajpiano> so you think AMD is an antipattern on the level of $.browser ? :o
[09:40:03] <ajpiano> :p
[09:40:11] <ajpiano> tj_vantoll: exactly
[09:40:53] <ajpiano> it's a thing that would make a LOT of developers' experience with UI a lot betteris at least soem minimal support, and direction on how to do it right
[09:41:20] <tj_vantoll> My vote is for a global AMD wrapper and when we release it we document why we did what we did, and how you can shim per widget dependencies if you want.
[09:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> So that's already possible with 0 changes in UI.
[09:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even think shimming is the correct answer.
[09:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> People need to stop being lazy and take five minutes to just wrap shit up and publish it.
[09:42:22] <ajpiano> what would they be publishing??
[09:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> Invidually wrapped files.
[09:42:41] <ajpiano> of UI ?
[09:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:42:58] <ajpiano> so instead of doing it ourselves, we ask someone else to do it?
[09:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, if the AMD community wants it, they should build it.
[09:43:20] <tj_vantoll> The reality is that most developers ARE lazy.
[09:43:21] <ajpiano> and then deal with the version lag, etc?
[09:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> Again, stop being lazy.
[09:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's a five second process to update.
[09:43:44] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: what's the downside of a UMD wrapper? besides the extra lines of code?
[09:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> Lack of standards.
[09:44:08] <ajpiano> you think that the amd community should just have forks of every lib and shim it themselves?
[09:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's a problem that the standards body cares about.
[09:44:18] <ajpiano> sounds like awesome undiscoverable fragmentation to me
[09:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> Not at all.
[09:44:43] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: do we link to it even?
[09:44:44] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: but does it break something adding it?
[09:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> This happens in EVERY OTHER ECOSYSTEM.
[09:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> NuGet, Ruby Gems, Bower, etc.
[09:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> Why is AMD so special that it needs to be the one that makes it upstream?
[09:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: It breaks my heart.
[09:45:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: +1
[09:45:32] <gseguin> :D
[09:46:06] <gseguin> jrburke maintains forks of backbone and underscore amdified there: https://github.com/amdjs
[09:46:39] <ajpiano> where is the tool that produces the files
[09:46:45] <ajpiano> the output of that should just be in a jquery ui repo
[09:46:54] <gseguin> I think he uses volo ( not sure though )
[09:47:11] <ajpiano> not in a github.com/jquery repo, but in a repo somewhere
[09:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jrburke/jqueryui-amd
[09:48:16] <gnarf> i think there needs to be an article on learn about this
[09:48:36] <ajpiano> or in the jquery ui site,
[09:48:51] <tj_vantoll> The jQuery UI site should link to an article on learn.
[09:48:53] <ajpiano> all i want is a canoncial explanation of how to tell people to make it work
[09:48:58] <tj_vantoll> +1
[09:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: That's what https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/186 is all about.
[09:50:10] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #186 by scottgonzalez (3mon 3w ago): Using jQuery UI in different environments
[09:50:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: added AMD to the issue
[09:50:57] <ajpiano> lol
[09:50:58] <ajpiano> me too
[09:51:15] <gnarf> you linked to AMD
[09:51:20] <gnarf> i'm changing it to jrburkes repo
[09:51:35] <ajpiano> true
[09:55:54] <tj_vantoll> Got to go, different meeting.  Later all.
[09:56:33] <gnarf> so, if we document this well
[09:56:38] <gnarf> i feel this isn't a big issue
[09:56:42] <gnarf> we should carry on
[09:56:50] <gnarf> is that the agenda scott_gonzalez?
[09:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll talk about the rest in -dev at over the week.
[09:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'll contact some people about AMD.
[09:58:42] <gnarf> look for an author to write that learn article? :)
[09:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:00:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[11:01:45] <gnarf> Infra Meeting - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUfGj8dQH3Q4JoBOlNnfDFrESzMt6LhktXsmtPYocXI/edit

[11:03:09] <gnarf> gseguin:
[11:03:37] <gnarf> so
[11:03:40] <gnarf> backups
[11:04:53] <gnarf> http://tarsnap.com
[11:05:01] <gnarf> neat service, pricing reasonable
[11:05:05] <gnarf> we are testing it out
[11:05:11] <gnarf> but i want to know what we need to backup
[11:05:35] <gnarf> if you think of something to backup https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/152
[11:07:10] <gnarf> also
[11:07:27] <gnarf> I really want to move our IRC services onto one machine, i think we should just make this jq05's job
[11:07:30] <gnarf> znc + irc bots
[11:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> seems reasonable
[11:08:29] <gnarf> i was hoping that gf3 or nlogax would show up
[11:08:39] <gnarf> but i'll get in touch with them and see about hosting b-ot there too
[11:08:45] <gnarf> and getting a little involved in fixing that
[11:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[11:10:34] <gnarf> not that i can think of
[11:10:35] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: ?
[11:10:40] <gnarf> rmill: ?
[11:10:59] <gnarf> we have #jquery-infrastructure
[11:11:48] <gnarf> lol
[11:11:50] <gnarf> muted
[11:11:54] <gnarf> this whole time scott_gonzalez
[11:12:05] <ryanneufeld> Way to go guize

[11:12:24] <rmill> Too many penis jokes?
[11:12:27] <gnarf> maybe
[11:12:29] <ryanneufeld> rmill: not enough
[11:12:41] <gnarf> `k channel modes
[11:12:41] <b-ot> gnarf: (╯°□°）╯︵sǝpoɯ ןǝuuɐɥɔ
[11:12:51] <ryanneufeld> alright, I think a dedicated host for znc and irc bots is a good idea
[11:12:55] <Krinkle> (just in case it didn't go through)
[11:12:55] <Krinkle> gnarf: there's a few (old?) "Stuff to copy" pages on infra wiki
[11:13:19] <rmill> We can keep the bot where it is now, I mean. Either way
[11:13:21] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: are we any closer to understanding the whooping that jq03 is getting?
[11:13:25] <Krinkle> gnarf: should this include non-files, like mysql backups
[11:13:45] <gnarf> Krinkle: i'm going to apply mysql backups to all the servers with mysql
[11:13:52] <Krinkle> k
[11:13:56] <rmill> I think the main thing is just building out remaining features
[11:14:07] <rmill> Then we can sort out where b-ot lives/loves.
[11:14:32] <gnarf> rmill: so, there's an interesting parallel with putting him on the jquery server
[11:14:38] <gnarf> he gets a jquery hostmask
[11:14:53] <gnarf> forinstance, /whois ryanneufeld
[11:14:55] <gnarf> gateway/shell/jquery.com/x-wpozgivygduyvmzi
[11:15:07] <rmill> Oh, I know what a hostmask is.
[11:15:21] <gnarf> just sayin, i like having him on that box, registered with freenode
[11:15:22] <gnarf> :)
[11:15:23] <rmill> I use reverse DNS, myself.
[11:15:30] <rmill> yea
[11:15:41] <rmill> If it's for the project, it makes sense.
[11:15:58] <rmill> I don't think gf3 or nlogax care where it lives.
[11:16:07] <rmill> I was hosting it for a bit
[11:16:13] <gnarf> i'll make sure you all have shell to it too
[11:16:21] <gnarf> b-ot team
[11:16:22] <gnarf> :)
[11:16:32] <gnarf> we should get some guides written up at some point too
[11:16:36] <gnarf> about the irc bot commands
[11:16:42] <rmill> We started one
[11:16:48] <gnarf> on irc.jquery.com ?
[11:16:50] <rmill> sec
[11:16:54] <gnarf> er .org
[11:16:55] <rmill> No, it's just on github, currently.
[11:17:32] <gnarf> i think we should try to get that on irc.jquery.org and/or contribute.jquery.org for guides on how to help writing plugins etc
[11:18:11] <rmill> https://github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.org/commit/1e6e17402b3ba6d4c19bbe293065a93ffcf24b2d
[11:18:12] <b-ot> rmill: adam j. sontag (3w 1d ago): Link directly to contribute.jquery.org docs in README to explain build instructions
[11:18:24] <rmill> wait
[11:18:25] <rmill> not that.
[11:18:28] <rmill> UM
[11:18:36] <rmill> I forget where that jank went.
[11:18:37] <rmill> sec
[11:20:15] <rmill> gnarf: humble begginings: https://github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.org/pull/7
[11:20:16] <b-ot> rmill: Pull request #7 by wesbos (4w 1h ago): starting to document all the b-ot plugins/commands
[11:20:48] <rmill> I don't think there's any point in documenting things like
[11:20:56] <rmill> WAT and UD, obviously.
[11:21:18] <rmill> or 8ball, or control
[11:21:24] <gnarf> sure
[11:21:25] <rmill> Or, crew
[11:21:27] <gnarf> but
[11:21:28] <gnarf> like
[11:21:30] <gnarf> `api
[11:21:36] <gnarf> factoids list in general
[11:22:06] <rmill> Yea
[11:22:11] <gnarf> `g `js
[11:22:11] <b-ot> gnarf: JavaScript - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
[11:22:26] <gnarf> how to love the bot perhaps
[11:22:30] <rmill> It would be nice to have an alias for `factoids` that would just push people to the site.
[11:22:41] <gnarf> sure
[11:22:57] <gnarf> if its on the same machine as jqlog
[11:23:01] <rmill> Do you want to just add this jank here: http://oksoclap.com/bott ?
[11:23:02] <gnarf> we can just publish it
[11:23:09] <Krinkle> `join #jquery-infrastructure
[11:23:14] <b-ot> Krinkle: I am now in #jquery-infrastructure.
[11:23:31] <gnarf> for now, I think I'm going to fork whatever we need and we can start using issues there
[11:24:40] <Krinkle> gnarf: bot-t vs b-ot ?
[11:24:51] <Krinkle> Im confused
[11:25:04] <gnarf> b-ot is maintained/crafted
[11:25:09] <gnarf> by active people
[11:25:18] <gnarf> bot-t has been falling behind in many ways
[11:25:19] <Krinkle> we have both in this channel
[11:25:21] <rmill> bot-t is held together with glue and tape
[11:25:26] <gnarf> we have both in most channels
[11:25:30] <gnarf> b-ot is the new
[11:25:37] <Krinkle> how come the other doesn't interfer?
[11:25:40] <gnarf> eventually we will just ban bot-t
[11:25:48] <gnarf> because ` isn't a bot-t trigger

[11:26:21] <gnarf> theres one they both know
[11:26:22] <gnarf> also
[11:26:23] <rmill> OVERLAP
[11:26:31] <gnarf> we need to get those factoids out of our splunk logs
[11:26:37] <gnarf> clark said he could do this
[11:26:44] <rmill> splunk logs?
[11:26:48] <gnarf> parse the bot responses
[11:26:53] <Krinkle> ?splunk
[11:26:56] <gnarf> yeah, all the irc logs are in splunk
[11:27:00] <bot-t> Krinkle, Splunk: Login - https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/
[11:27:05] <Krinkle> :)
[11:27:08] <gf3> gnarf: Also, I'm willing to make all the factoids public, too
[11:27:20] <gf3> gnarf: It's all stored in redis right now and is easily portable
[11:27:30] <gnarf> gf3: yeah, one of the reasons i want to host this
[11:27:31] <Krinkle> in version control even, maybe?
[11:27:51] <gnarf> is so it can be on the same server as irc.jquery.org's logs
[11:27:57] <gnarf> i have a machine
[11:28:03] <gnarf> can get you and nlogax and rmill shell
[11:28:13] <Krinkle> not for very change (since afaik they can be defined from irc), but putting them in git every now and then would be nice
[11:28:14] <gnarf> and it's also running znc
[11:28:49] <gf3> Krinkle: Which?
[11:29:08] <Krinkle> gf3: I assume the bot software is in version control on github?
[11:29:16] <gf3> Krinkle: Naturally
[11:29:24] <gnarf> the factoid db isn't tho
[11:29:24] <Krinkle> gf3: is it jquery specific?
[11:29:42] <gf3> Krinkle: No
[11:29:46] <Krinkle> gf3: ok
[11:29:59] <gf3> Krinkle: https://github.com/gf3/IRC-js
[11:29:59] <gf3> Krinkle: https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot
[11:29:59] <gf3> Krinkle: https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot-plugins
[11:30:21] <gnarf> gf3: i think i'm gonna fork nlogax/ircjsbot
[11:30:25] <Krinkle> I was thinking (if it was) there'd be a command or script to export the db into a file (a format that the bot would also support importing), and then put that file in version control, e.g. jquery/infra or anywhere else for that matter
[11:30:27] <Krinkle> so it is public
[11:30:29] <gnarf> onto jquery
[11:30:31] <gf3> gnarf: Why?
[11:31:27] <gnarf> well a) I want to actually make the plugins more modular
[11:31:58] <gnarf> b) i dunno, seems like a good project to have on the jquery/ list if its "our bot"
[11:32:42] <gnarf> i mean, if you think the bot is just the config file, then perhaps it doesn't have a jquery/ repo
[11:33:29] <gf3> I dunno, I suppose it doesn't matter—but yeah, that's essentially all it is
[11:34:07] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: perhaps then the botconfig would be 'ours'
[11:34:25] <gnarf> well i mean, thats just managed in something like puppet yeah?
[11:34:57] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:35:19] <ryanneufeld> I think we should have a set of our own hard-coded, not changable factoids though
[11:36:57] <gnarf> gf3: also, I'd like to use issues to track the status of this particular bot somewhere
[11:37:01] <gnarf> or the plugins for this bot
[11:37:12] <gnarf> they could be spread out
[11:37:25] <gf3> https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot-plugins/issues
[11:38:00] <gnarf> but i'm just thinking from like a "i want to help with the irc bot" standpoint, perhaps we just need documentation
[11:38:47] <rmill> ircjsbot-plugins needs an .MD file
[11:38:55] <rmill> FORSHURE
[11:39:12] <gnarf> I'm kind of lost on where to go if i want to contribute, ya know?
[11:40:02] <gnarf> gf3: who's hosting b-ot atm?
[11:40:31] <rmill> gnarf: gf3 is.
[11:40:32] <gf3> gnarf: I am
[11:40:46] <gnarf> gf3: can you help me get it setup and working on a jQuery server?
[11:40:52] <gnarf> maybe later today?
[11:41:04] <gf3> gnarf: Sure thing
[11:41:11] <gf3> gnarf: Ubuntu?
[11:41:13] <gnarf> debian
[11:41:25] <gf3> Cool, I have an init script for the bot
[11:41:34] <gf3> Which could probably use some love, but it works
[11:41:43] <rmill> I had it running in debian
[11:41:45] <gf3> I also have a super basic monit config
[11:41:45] <gnarf> i use a template one for all the node services we have
[11:41:50] <rmill> before gf3 stole it back.
[11:42:19] <gnarf> but we can make specifics
[11:42:29] <clarkbox> IM HERE!
[11:42:46] <gnarf> clarkbox: hey, can you work on the factoids list? like what factoids map to what responses?
[11:42:51] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: they let you down from the DN tower!
[11:42:54] <clarkbox> yup
[11:42:59] <clarkbox> they did!
[11:44:49] <gnarf> oh also
[11:45:02] <gnarf> clarkbox: can you help me move jqlog to jq05 ?
[11:48:25] <clarkbox> yup
[11:48:44] <clarkbox> ill get that done this week
[11:52:55] <gnarf> cool
[11:53:04] <gnarf> back in -infra or #irc-js for more discuss
