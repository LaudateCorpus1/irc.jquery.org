[11:05:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot: cgack: sfrisk: lisa_del_: Meeting time
[11:05:28] <lisa_del_> howdy
[11:05:29] <cgack> hi!
[11:05:29] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:05:32] <sfrisk> allo
[11:05:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:05:52] <agcolom> hey :-)
[11:07:35] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=56
[11:08:46] <arschmitz> Ok lets get started with classes
[11:08:56] <arschmitz> since thats the big hold up on 1.5
[11:09:41] <gabriel_schulhof> *drumroll*
[11:09:44] <arschmitz> We had a skype call this morning with scott_gonzalez and jzaefferer and we came to i "think" a finial decision
[11:10:06] <arschmitz> we will be doing auto destory of classes
[11:10:39] <arschmitz> and we will be doing _add/_removeClass
[11:11:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[11:11:06] <arschmitz> the signiture will be _addClass( elements, classeskeys, extra );
[11:11:23] <arschmitz> we will also have _toggleClass
[11:11:31] <gabriel_schulhof> So "extra" won't be tracked?
[11:11:38] <arschmitz> extra will be tracked
[11:11:42] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:11:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice. That makes it a complete solution.
[11:12:05] <cgack> excellent
[11:12:06] <arschmitz> toggle class will require a boolean final param
[11:12:23] <arschmitz> _toggleClass( elements, classeskeys, extra, bool );
[11:12:38] <arschmitz> and unlike core you MUST pass the bool option
[11:12:47] <arschmitz> param i mean
[11:13:20] <arschmitz> there is one more big change
[11:13:29] <arschmitz> which is we will no longer define null nested options
[11:13:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm?
[11:13:51] <arschmitz> so you wont have like classes: { "ui-button": "" }
[11:14:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[11:14:02] <arschmitz> you just wont define ui-button at all
[11:14:13] <arschmitz> this is for all widget options not just classes
[11:14:32] <arschmitz> ok to be clear that example WAS NOT NULL
[11:14:51] <arschmitz> but we are switching back to null for classes values that are empty
[11:14:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, so, null, or falsy?
[11:14:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[11:14:59] <arschmitz> which means they wont be defined
[11:15:00] <gabriel_schulhof> GOtcha.
[11:15:24] <gabriel_schulhof> So, "" is OK, false is OK, but null and undefined are, well, gonna be absent.
[11:15:26] <arschmitz> the concatenation idea didn't really work in practice
[11:15:48] <arschmitz> because you needed to hit the prototype to get it to concant to anyway at which point it makes little difference
[11:16:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: right
[11:16:54] <arschmitz> but thats only for nested options
[11:17:14] <gabriel_schulhof> ... of which we don't have too many in mobile, IIRC.
[11:17:15] <arschmitz> so where its an object
[11:17:25] <arschmitz> there are not a ton in ui either
[11:18:19] <arschmitz> ok so thats the classes news
[11:19:37] <arschmitz> on other 1.5 stuff gabriel_schulhofi started reviewing the test fixes i have some questions but we can talk about that after
[11:19:49] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:20:05] <arschmitz> it looks mostly fine though nothing big
[11:20:39] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: any update on the css?
[11:20:42] <gabriel_schulhof> It's gonna get quicke a knockin' once we actually start moving up to the new classes implementation :)
[11:20:51] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, the CSS is done
[11:21:26] <arschmitz> excellent so you would say its ready for review and merge into ui-1-12
[11:21:34] <gabriel_schulhof> I know this is waaay preliminary but is there any sense when we'll be Chassis-compliant?
[11:21:35] <jasperdegroot> I haven't finished updating the button and checkboxradio demo pages though
[11:22:00] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: how long do you think that will take just want to decide if we should wait on that or not
[11:22:01] <arschmitz> '?
[11:22:06] <jasperdegroot> that had also to do with me not knowing how certain data- attributes are supposed to work in 1.5
[11:22:24] <arschmitz> did i answer that ?
[11:22:52] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I think there are some issues with the backcompat
[11:23:13] <jasperdegroot> like data-type="vertical" on a controlgroup doesn't work
[11:23:29] <arschmitz> i thought we talked about that already?
[11:23:32] <jasperdegroot> that wasn't a problem, because I update the demos to use data-direction which works
[11:23:47] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, you said that should work
[11:23:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, but how are we gonna handle that in 1.5.0?
[11:24:02] <arschmitz> ok gotcha i remember now
[11:24:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Are we gonna make an extension that just aliases the option?
[11:24:11] <arschmitz> yes
[11:24:13] <arschmitz> we have to
[11:24:14] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:24:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Just checking.
[11:24:19] <jasperdegroot> but things like data-theme also don't work
[11:24:28] <arschmitz> theme should work
[11:24:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right, you added that widget extension for the theme option.
[11:24:46] <arschmitz> but dont worry about that stuff for now
[11:25:18] <arschmitz> lets just get the css in place and that makes it possible to actually see whats broken a lot easier and fix it
[11:25:44] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: well, I don't feel like updating those demo pages twice so I am just wondering if I am doing it wrong or if something is not working (yet)
[11:25:59] <arschmitz> right thats fine ill answer any questions as far as that
[11:26:08] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok, then let's merge 1.5-button-css-and-demos in ui-1-12
[11:26:19] <arschmitz> ok
[11:26:46] <arschmitz> so once the updates come down the line from ui ill pull in the css and update ui-1-12
[11:26:48] <jasperdegroot> maybe we should add a functional test page for button, controlgroup and checkboxradio
[11:27:12] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: we will be adding a bunch of tests for those both visiual and unit
[11:27:16] <jasperdegroot> to test backcompat
[11:27:17] <gabriel_schulhof> I have one for button-markup ...
[11:27:21] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:27:26] <gabriel_schulhof> ... may still be useful.
[11:27:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah we will have full test coverage
[11:27:45] <arschmitz> for anything we change from the ui widget including backcompat
[11:27:55] <arschmitz> we just wont duplicate ui's tests
[11:27:57] <jasperdegroot> great
[11:28:27] <arschmitz> our coverage will actually likely be much more complete then it was
[11:29:27] <arschmitz> speaking of which
[11:29:42] <arschmitz> QUnit 1.16 was released this week
[11:29:49] <arschmitz> which changes the api quite a bit
[11:30:10] <arschmitz> we will need to update ALL of our tests before 2.0 when the current api is going to be dropped
[11:30:45] <arschmitz> since we have some pretty substantial other problems in the tests
[11:30:58] <arschmitz> we should address this all at once
[11:31:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... our init tests, for example ...
[11:31:22] <arschmitz> one big advantage
[11:31:27] <gabriel_schulhof> They have require() calls in the _core.js
[11:31:30] <arschmitz> is tests now return a promise
[11:31:49] <arschmitz> so for nav tests we can use that directly instead of a time out in some places
[11:31:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Oooh! Nice!
[11:32:12] <arschmitz> so this should remove some flake from out tests too
[11:32:28] <arschmitz> but its going to be a ton of work
[11:32:38] <arschmitz> we should probably aim for 1.6 or 1.7 on this
[11:32:55] <arschmitz> because we also need to get them passing on all supported devices
[11:33:31] <arschmitz> right now we assume certain things are supported in our tests
[11:33:54] <arschmitz> meaning its not possible for them to pass on some devices which we support
[11:34:16] <arschmitz> does not mean the library is broke just that we have bad tests
[11:34:50] <arschmitz> No updates on pointer events this week
[11:35:08] <arschmitz> The CSS Framework has a name
[11:35:11] <arschmitz> Chassis
[11:35:45] <arschmitz> We confirmed that we will be using SVG for icons
[11:36:54] <arschmitz> sfrisk: and i are meeting with Yandex next week
[11:37:06] <sfrisk> yuuup
[11:37:08] <arschmitz> They are the russian company that created BEM
[11:37:40] <jasperdegroot> cool
[11:37:43] <arschmitz> Oleg works for them they are basically the russian google with some pretty amazing devs
[11:38:32] <arschmitz> sfrisk: i think thats about it this week right?
[11:39:26] <sfrisk> I believe so - I think everything else was decided last week and was probably already announced here
[11:39:35] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[11:39:52] <arschmitz> ok last thing i see on the agenda is popup on android
[11:40:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. I wrote a fix that checks whether the popup is on screen, before initiating the repositioning insanity.
[11:40:36] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it is insanity if a virtual keyboard is present at the time.
[11:40:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: would using ui's position utility make any of this more sane?
[11:41:07] <gabriel_schulhof> I doubt it. It's not about the calculated position being wrong, but about the fact that we need to hide/show the popup.
[11:41:32] <gabriel_schulhof> ... in fact, it may not even be that. I tried to not hide/show the popup, but simply reposition it and it was just as bad.
[11:41:46] <gabriel_schulhof> I think the bottom line is that the repositioning code needs to be rethought.
[11:42:07] <arschmitz> yeah it seems like we are doing this all wrong and there is a better way to handle it
[11:42:08] <gabriel_schulhof> This was at some point a plan, but now we've veered far from that course.
[11:42:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Looking into this has also made me a bit concerned about replacing popup with dialog.
[11:42:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Dialog is a very different beast.
[11:42:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and much slower because of all the extra features.
[11:43:12] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but I'm not sure if we should discuss this during the meeting. I'm good with talking about it in -dev afterwards.
[11:43:17] <arschmitz> that seems like something that could potentially addressed in ui
[11:43:59] <gabriel_schulhof> The question is one of use cases though.
[11:44:12] <arschmitz> ok
[11:44:30] <gabriel_schulhof> If popups are mostly used for creating dialogs, then dialog is the way to go - after we've factored resizable and draggable into a separate extension.
[11:44:50] <arschmitz> resizable and draggable are their own extensions?
[11:45:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Not right now, but if we're gonna use UI dialog, they should be.
[11:45:12] <arschmitz> you can use dialog with out either of them
[11:45:17] <arschmitz> they are completely optional
[11:45:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, you can turn it off, but it still AMD-depends on the draggable and resizable module.
[11:45:47] <arschmitz> it shouldnt
[11:45:54] <arschmitz> they are optional always have been
[11:46:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, it's kinda weird. It AMD-depends on the module but then it turns around and checks whether $.fn.draggable is present.
[11:46:26] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/dialog.js#L128
[11:46:28] <gabriel_schulhof> So, that's kind of a contradition.
[11:46:36] <arschmitz> yeah thats not correct
[11:46:37] <gabriel_schulhof> contradiction, even.
[11:46:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[11:47:37] <arschmitz> guess not
[11:47:47] <arschmitz> but we can address that on our own as is
[11:47:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, anyway ... I just wanna make sure that if we do grab dialog, then we do not unjustifiedly pay a perf penalty.
[11:48:07] <arschmitz> draggable and resizable are non issues
[11:48:18] <arschmitz> because we can shim the amd
[11:48:20] <arschmitz> on our side
[11:48:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey, that's a good point!
[11:48:36] <arschmitz> to make sure they are actually optional
[11:49:20] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I have a nice test setup at http://jsperf.com/dialog-vs-popup/, so I can test various scenarios.
[11:49:44] <arschmitz> but does that include draggable and resizable?
[11:49:55] <arschmitz> it does
[11:50:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It does now, but I can turn it off and see how it influences performance.
[11:50:13] <arschmitz> i would like to see that
[11:50:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Doing it now ...
[11:50:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Should be as simply as passing draggable: false, resizable: false to the options.
[11:51:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: not even
[11:51:11] <arschmitz> just take out the script tags
[11:51:25] <arschmitz> we cant even use them right now they only work on mouse
[11:51:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaah, true!
[11:51:50] <arschmitz> they are also going to be re-written
[11:52:00] <arschmitz> and ours does not do that
[11:53:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Dialog is 20% slower when the popup also has a header.
[11:53:31] <gabriel_schulhof> That's not bad.
[11:53:41] <arschmitz> nope
[11:53:47] <arschmitz> and im sure we could do some optimization
[11:54:01] <arschmitz> if we work with the ui folk
[11:54:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, and we may want to short circuit title bar creation.
[11:54:08] <gabriel_schulhof> ... with an extension.
[11:54:49] <arschmitz> we can also work with them to isolate dom manip in create so we can add enhanced
[11:54:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, and we'll also need to update the positioning, and the modal overlay does not resize to the height of the document on some platforms.
[11:55:22] <arschmitz> these are all really minor things we either add by extension or work with ui on
[11:55:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[11:55:31] <gabriel_schulhof> It's gonna be fun.
[11:55:40] <arschmitz> so since it seems like perf is not an issue any more are there any other major concerns
[11:55:41] <gabriel_schulhof> But it's good do keep performance in mind.
[11:56:04] <arschmitz> yes but 20% before any optimization is not bad
[11:56:16] <arschmitz> i can live with that
[11:56:34] <arschmitz> espically if we can push of some from create->open
[11:56:35] <gabriel_schulhof> No ... no ... and I'm hoping to bring it up to par with an extension that eliminates the title bar.
[11:57:49] <gabriel_schulhof> So, that's about it re: popup
[11:58:20] <arschmitz> ok cool
[11:58:38] <arschmitz> anyone have anything else or anything from the community?
[12:01:45] <arschmitz> ok thanks everyone see everyone on -dev
[12:01:49] <gabriel_schulhof> L8R
[12:02:03] <jasperdegroot> later
[12:02:09] <lisa_del_> adios
