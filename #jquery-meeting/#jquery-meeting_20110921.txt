[09:02:00] <gnarf> OMG meeting
[09:02:05] <jzaefferer> hello party people
[09:02:14] * gnarf runs to grab coffee - back in a sec
[09:02:25] <jzaefferer> good feedback on the m6 release: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/09/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-6-spinner-2/#comments
[09:04:44] <jzaefferer> pinged danheberden earlier, as the agenda suggests, there's nothing UI-specific on infrastructure going on; things like getting better servers for swarm.jquery.org are somewhat stalled, we'll get there eventually
[09:05:01] <jzaefferer> dunno if rworth or danheberden have anything for docs?
[09:05:06] <danheberden> jzaefferer you gonna be at jqcon?
[09:05:09] <jzaefferer> or gnarf on testing animations?
[09:05:13] <jzaefferer> danheberden: yep
[09:05:22] <rworth> nothing from me on docs
[09:05:28] <danheberden> cool - lets plan on talking about testswarm stuff if we can
[09:06:00] <jzaefferer> sure, will do
[09:06:04] <gnarf> I was hoping to get at the testing this week, but found myself busier with my 1.7 core stuff than I thought I would be
[09:06:13] <jzaefferer> in that regard, does someone have a contact at browserstack?
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yes
[09:06:39] <jzaefferer> hey scott
[09:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> hey :-)
[09:06:53] <jzaefferer> think they could help us with testswarm clients?
[09:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> maybe, I'll ask
[09:07:03] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:07:13] <danheberden> haha, is the contact @browserstack?
[09:07:21] <danheberden> i kid i kid
[09:08:01] <jzaefferer> o_O
[09:08:30] <jzaefferer> so, datepicker regression is fixed, yay
[09:08:35] <jzaefferer> we'll see if that regresses...
[09:09:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/419/ ? I can't tell anymore with UI/core/browser combos we are targetting with it
[09:09:12] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by inukshuk (1m, 2w ago): Positions: added conditional suppression of position rounding
[09:09:27] <jzaefferer> actually https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/460
[09:09:27] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (6d, 22h ago): Position: Added a check for fraction support in element positions based on @inukshuk's original method
[09:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 -> 1.6+, 1.8 -> 1.3.2+, same browsers for both
[09:11:21] <jzaefferer> so, do we need this patch in master? or just 1-8-stable?
[09:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> just 1-8-stable
[09:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> in 1.9 we know there's always fraction support
[09:14:05] <jzaefferer> okay, that makes sense
[09:14:39] <gnarf> oh hey
[09:14:41] <jzaefferer> will work with kborchers to land that
[09:14:47] <gnarf> so, speaking of positioning stuff
[09:14:51] <jzaefferer> yeah?
[09:15:05] <gnarf> has anyone else noticed that positions are wacky when you cmd plus/minus the fonts?
[09:15:13] <gnarf> at least in chrome...
[09:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, Chrome sucks
[09:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> we can't fix it
[09:15:33] <gnarf> is that only webkit?
[09:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:15:44] <gnarf> have we reported to webkit?
[09:16:12] <gnarf> cuz its gonna toast all our effects, and .position() and a few other things I would imagine
[09:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> they know about it
[09:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6222
[09:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> I probably should've linked to the webkit ticket when I found it
[09:17:09] <gnarf> paul_irish: you happen to be lurking? master webkit bug searcher guy? :)
[09:17:27] <jzaefferer> "This is fixed in Chrome 8 (dev)."?
[09:17:39] <jzaefferer> never made it to stable?
[09:17:53] <gnarf> does it not also affect safari?
[09:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[09:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> let me test again
[09:19:28] <gnarf> theres a new related ticket
[09:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> it does seem to work in Chrome for me
[09:19:41] <gnarf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7726
[09:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: do you have a test case showing the bug?
[09:19:59] <gnarf> well mine is an effect
[09:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil close the core bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8834
[09:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> *closed
[09:20:27] <gnarf> also i noticed earlier today that if i zoomed in on the core test suite it failed a ton of tests
[09:20:29] <gnarf> in animate
[09:21:04] <gnarf> i wonder if its just because I'm rounding or something now
[09:22:00] <gnarf> like that bounce isn't right when you're zoomed in (on the fiddle i linked in 7726 comments )
[09:22:08] <gnarf> i can dig more
[09:22:23] <gnarf> was just hoping that someone knew of the issue/caveats of it already
[09:23:03] <jzaefferer> so, can we close #6222?
[09:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> we'll need to test Safari
[09:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> works in Safari 5
[09:27:16] <gnarf> no test case?
[09:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> broken in Safari 4
[09:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> you can use any autocomplete demo as a test case
[09:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> closed as wontfix
[09:29:25] <gnarf> should i do the same with the effect?
[09:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> is it only broken in Safari 4?
[09:29:37] <gnarf> nah
[09:29:42] <gnarf> still broken in chrome
[09:29:47] <gnarf> i'll try to trace it
[09:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> then it must be something else
[09:32:59] <jzaefferer> so, let's move on with the rest of agenda?
[09:33:21] <gnarf> on to the next one
[09:34:04] <gnarf> http://grooveshark.com/#/s/On+To+The+Next+One+feat+Swizz+Beatz+/2OeumN?src=5
[09:34:06] <gnarf> ;)
[09:34:21] <jzaefferer> right..
[09:34:32] <jzaefferer> so the Menu PRs all landed!
[09:34:33] <jzaefferer> yay
[09:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:35:13] <jzaefferer> Kris started working on Popup now, Menubar up next
[09:35:51] <jzaefferer> Felix says he should have a first version of selectmenu on github by the weekend
[09:36:30] <jzaefferer> and Colin says their Fluid release is now almost done, so we may get some contributions from them sometime soon
[09:36:45] <jzaefferer> haven't heard anything from Hans for a week though :/
[09:37:06] <jzaefferer> he's sitting on some important datepicker and popup updates
[09:37:37] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure if all his code is in his repo on GitHub or if he's got local updates not yet pushed...
[09:38:10] <jzaefferer> that's my grid-related UI update :-)
[09:38:22] <jzaefferer> Scott, wanna talk about tabs and download builder?
[09:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> sure, we'll start with tabs
[09:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> we discussed key bindings with Hans last week
[09:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> the problem is that the recommended key bindings are the same as what desktop apps (and therefore browsers) use
[09:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> so the tabs in the page and the tabs in the browser are fighting for the key bindings
[09:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> and some browsers don't allow you to stop the browser from taking action
[09:40:59] <scott_gonzalez> i.e., event.preventDefault() doesn't prevent the default
[09:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> so we were discussing alternate key bindings
[09:41:39] <rworth> fun
[09:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to email the other library authors and try to get everyone on the same page
[09:41:51] <gnarf> good call
[09:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> we also had a call with Nodejitsu last week to discuss download builder
[09:42:21] <rworth> semi-related, we have to figure out such a thing for dialog, yes?
[09:42:38] <jzaefferer> I was on that call, but my focus was somewhat split… what recommendations are we using as a base?
[09:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> as far as I know, F6 doesn't conflict with anything
[09:43:07] <jzaefferer> Felix' implementation is based on WCAG (or something like that) and seems to be much simpler without conflicts
[09:43:13] <rworth> so F6 is used in other apps, but not be browsers?
[09:43:14] <jzaefferer> wondering if that isn't enough...
[09:43:22] <rworth> not by
[09:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know if other apps use F6
[09:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> I've certainly never used it
[09:44:14] <jzaefferer> pretty sure F6 is doing for IE what Cmd+L is doing on OSX browsers
[09:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> our recommendation is using alt instead of ctrl
[09:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> so alt+up arrow
[09:44:36] <rworth> I remember researching F6 a couple years back, can't remember if I found apps that use it, I feel like I did
[09:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> and alt+page up
[09:44:56] <jzaefferer> is ctrl+up from the dhtml styleguide?
[09:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:45:02] <jzaefferer> or is that also anywhere else?
[09:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> ctrl+up = scrolling, ctrl+page up = change tab
[09:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> that's the native implementation in a browser
[09:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> so they both conflict
[09:45:46] <jzaefferer> really annoying that Felix couldn't make it to the meeting - he had never heard of the dhtml stylguide...
[09:46:12] <jzaefferer> seems to me like we should try again to bring him and Hans together on a call
[09:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:46:55] <jzaefferer> I need to talk to Hans anyway
[09:48:00] <jzaefferer> soo, nodejitsu?
[09:48:06] <rworth> rocks
[09:48:22] <jzaefferer> rocks as in run'n'coke?
[09:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> they're going to build and host the download builder
[09:48:34] <rworth> :D
[09:48:35] <jzaefferer> host?
[09:48:43] <rworth> that's a good thing
[09:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, they're a hosting company
[09:48:53] <rworth> that means they're motivated to keep it running
[09:48:58] <rworth> caus it reflects on them
[09:48:59] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[09:49:07] <rworth> on how well they build and maintain/scale it
[09:49:14] <jzaefferer> but the actual builder will run locally as well, right?
[09:49:19] <jzaefferer> as in, replace our ant build
[09:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:49:28] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:49:53] <jzaefferer> so is it going to be like a web service that we integrate?
[09:50:00] <rworth> we also gave them enough of an idea about ThemeRoller they might take that on next/later, but they're starting with just the build
[09:50:02] <jzaefferer> or are they going to host the full ui site?
[09:50:14] <rworth> I wouldn't think so
[09:50:29] <rworth> but the rest of the site is static enough, I wouldn't care if it made hosting simpler
[09:50:36] <rworth> in terms of domains, subdomains
[09:50:43] <rworth> redirects and what-not
[09:51:15] <rworth> or another option would be a subdomain like download.jqueryui.com
[09:51:21] <jzaefferer> well, submitting the download form to another site and getting back the download shouldn't be much of a problem
[09:51:23] <rworth> and we redirect jqueryui.com/download to it
[09:51:25] <rworth> er, them
[09:55:14] <jzaefferer> so, m6 is released, as usual not much feedback on that
[09:57:08] <jzaefferer> I guess that's it for today
[09:58:08] <jzaefferer> grid meeting in two minutes then
[10:01:32] <brado23> hi all!
[10:01:49] <rworth> hey
[10:01:57] <gnarf> howdy
[10:03:28] <jzaefferer> hey brado23
[10:03:44] <jzaefferer> is boris coming?
[10:03:53] <brado23> let me ping him...
[10:04:22] <brado23> he doesn't seem to be around this morning.
[10:04:39] <brado23> ...although I know he was cranking on templates yesterday.
[10:05:07] <jzaefferer> oh well, will have to check with him later
[10:05:17] <brado23> he was crunching to get stuff ready for today, so I'm surprised he's not around
[10:05:37] <rworth> he gave me a good update on templates yesterday, I can share with anyone interested
[10:06:12] <jzaefferer> please do
[10:06:13] <rworth> I told him I plan to take 0.5-1 day later this week (Thu or Fri) and dig in to what he's posted most recently
[10:06:22] <rworth> I think he's still to post a perf update
[10:06:34] <rworth> ok, so over the weekend he did a bug update to jsRender
[10:06:47] <rworth> making it pretty useful (where before it was early/in-progress)
[10:06:53] <rworth> I'm speaking of logic-less of course
[10:07:05] <rworth> I haven't actually had a close look, only looked briefly at the demos
[10:07:07] <gnarf> yay borismoore
[10:07:08] <rworth> there's borismoore
[10:07:26] <borismoore> Sorry, laptop reboot issues
[10:09:52] <borismoore> Did you want status on codeless templates?
[10:09:57] <rworth> borismoore: why don't you go ahead with a template update?
[10:10:02] <rworth> that would be great, thanks
[10:10:06] <borismoore> ok
[10:10:17] <borismoore> Well, made some good progress
[10:10:34] <borismoore> Demos here of jsrender codeless style http://borismoore.github.com/jsrender/demos/index.html
[10:10:56] <borismoore> or here, rather: http://borismoore.github.com/jsrender/demos/index-codeless.html
[10:11:17] <borismoore> And these which integrate that into jsviews http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/step-by-step-codeless/index.html
[10:12:00] <borismoore> Did some perf optimization work too
[10:12:12] <jzaefferer> so codeless is now what used to be "logicless"
[10:12:13] <jzaefferer> ?
[10:12:28] <borismoore> This page takes a while to render, and shows some comparison data on your browser http://borismoore.github.com/jsrender/test/perf-compare.html
[10:12:36] <borismoore> Yes
[10:13:03] <jzaefferer> ${prop} as a shortcut for {{= prop}} isn't yet implemented?
[10:13:08] <jzaefferer> or just not used in the demos?
[10:13:11] <borismoore> Mustache coined (I think) the term logicless, which includes the idea that there is no if or each tag
[10:13:36] <jzaefferer> what unit are those timings?
[10:13:40] <borismoore> Ours is not logicless in that sense - hence codeless
[10:13:52] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[10:13:55] <jzaefferer> eval-less :-)
[10:13:59] <borismoore> No short cut for {{=foo}}
[10:14:05] <borismoore> Not sure we need one
[10:14:17] <borismoore>  ${} collides with Django
[10:14:59] <jzaefferer> it probably can't be added easily as a 'custom' tag, right?
[10:15:00] <borismoore> Unit is kinda irrelevant, since it depends on the size of the data and the template how long it runs, but you can look at the code.
[10:15:13] <borismoore> comparative is more relevant
[10:15:25] <borismoore> yes could be added as a custom tag
[10:15:34] <borismoore> Adding custom tags is very easy now
[10:15:45] <borismoore> they are just functions
[10:16:10] <borismoore> also the compiled function is now very clean and concise, so easy to understand and debug
[10:16:26] <jzaefferer> but ${} isn't a custom tag like {{custom …}} is...
[10:16:27] <borismoore> radically different from jquery tmpl compiled template functions,
[10:16:44] <jzaefferer> whats a good way to look at the compiled function?
[10:16:45] <borismoore> No, not sure we want ${} anyway.
[10:17:06] <jzaefferer> having it would make migration from jquery-tmpl easier
[10:17:14] <borismoore> {{=}} is easy to write and is easier to see, amongst the rest of the markup
[10:17:37] <jzaefferer> okay, nevermind that then
[10:18:04] <borismoore> sure, but there are many way worse problems on migrating. The whole syntax is different, with space separation, and no code
[10:18:23] <borismoore> You have to port all your expressions into custom tags
[10:18:36] <borismoore> That's why I strongly resisted codeless :)
[10:18:51] <jzaefferer> looked at the benchmark code - might be worth using benchmark.js or jsperf.com to get better results, but looks fine to me as-is
[10:19:05] <jzaefferer> new/codeless == hella fast!
[10:19:36] <borismoore> That is not yet public, so not adding to the jsperf test for templates till I go public on a labelled jsrender drop
[10:19:50] <jzaefferer> well, I can do a search and replace on the two projects using jquery-tmpl to replace ${(.+)} with {{= $1}}
[10:20:04] <jzaefferer> okay, makes sense
[10:20:14] <borismoore> codeless without encoding is as fast as the fasted (doT) and compiles 3 times faster that doT!
[10:20:18] <jzaefferer> so, how can I look at a compiled template?
[10:20:23] <borismoore> fastest
[10:20:37] <jzaefferer> that's pretty sweet
[10:20:47] <jzaefferer> and doT templates probably aren't easy to read?
[10:20:51] <rworth> yeah
[10:21:02] <borismoore> look at the sample with code. add {{* debugger; }}
[10:21:06] <borismoore> That's one way.
[10:21:24] <jzaefferer> some console command I can use?
[10:21:38] <borismoore> Or just look at running scripts in your favorite dev environment
[10:22:13] <jzaefferer> that seems to work: $.template(id)
[10:22:14] <jzaefferer> function anonymous($data, $view) {
[10:22:14] <jzaefferer> var tag=$.renderTag,html=$.tmplEncode.html,
[10:22:14] <jzaefferer> result=""+"<tr> <td>"+html($data.Title)+"</td> <td class=\"synopsis\">"+$data.Synopsis+"</td> </tr>";
[10:22:14] <jzaefferer> return result;
[10:22:14] <jzaefferer> }
[10:22:17] <jzaefferer> for http://borismoore.github.com/jsrender/demos/step-by-step-codeless/2_no-encoding.html
[10:22:35] <jzaefferer> for this template:
[10:22:35] <jzaefferer> <tr>
[10:22:35] <jzaefferer> <td>{{=Title}}</td>
[10:22:36] <jzaefferer> <td class="synopsis">{{=Synopsis!}}</td>
[10:22:37] <jzaefferer> </tr>
[10:23:08] <jzaefferer> are line breaks collapsed or is that just happening in the console output?
[10:24:58] <jzaefferer> looks like some namespacing still needs to happen, instead of dumping all methods into the jQuery-namespace directly
[10:27:11] <borismoore> Chrome died, sorry...
[10:28:11] <jzaefferer> meh
[10:28:17] <borismoore> are we done for templates status, from your point of view?
[10:28:25] <jzaefferer> http://bassistance.de/i/a762bd.png
[10:28:33] <jzaefferer> dunno if you saw any of that?
[10:29:55] <borismoore> ok :(
[10:30:25] <borismoore> line breaks are collapse to single space. There are issues otherwise. Same with jquery tmpl
[10:30:39] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:30:40] <gnarf> wont that mean you can't use <pre>'s?
[10:30:52] <borismoore> We could have a mode for exact whitespace, but not there yet
[10:31:06] <borismoore> I need to look at that scenarios
[10:31:25] <jzaefferer> okay, not that much of a priority, if it can be tackled later on
[10:31:31] <borismoore> I had exact whitespace, but there were things that conflict with that. I'll look at it
[10:31:55] <borismoore> What do you mean, dumping methods?
[10:32:03] <borismoore> You mean $.render etc?
[10:32:12] <borismoore> or something else?
[10:32:13] <jzaefferer> yeah
[10:32:31] <jzaefferer> render, template, renderTag, tmplEncode
[10:32:37] <borismoore> Sure, by design, but we may want to fine tune the design
[10:32:51] <borismoore> render and template is like before, (tmpl and template)
[10:32:51] <jzaefferer> by design?
[10:33:00] <jzaefferer> sure, but those others?
[10:33:27] <borismoore> renderTag and tmplEncode need to be accessed from the compiled function
[10:33:45] <borismoore> and you need to be able to call myTmpl(data)
[10:34:00] <jzaefferer> sure, but that doesn't they have to live in $
[10:34:12] <jzaefferer> just suggesting to group them
[10:34:19] <jzaefferer> within some other property
[10:34:29] <borismoore> If we force you to do $.render( myTmpl, data ) then we create a view object and can use that
[10:34:48] <borismoore> Yeah grouping = fine tuning :)
[10:35:00] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:35:07] <borismoore> But we want duck-punchable methods right?
[10:35:26] <borismoore> So no $.render.tmplEncode
[10:35:27] <jzaefferer> I don't know what that means
[10:35:28] <borismoore> etc
[10:35:40] <gnarf> monkey patch = duck punch
[10:35:42] <jzaefferer> not following
[10:36:13] <borismoore> You need to hang your group off a names space, Anyway we can take that offline or on Skype...
[10:36:17] <jzaefferer> what's wrong with $.render.tmplEncode, if $.render is the namespace for the plugin?

[10:36:54] <jzaefferer> I actually need to leave now or very soon
[10:36:59] <borismoore> You didn't like that previously, since $.render is also a method. (Or else I misunderstood you)..
