[11:00:48] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:01:19] <uGoMobi> time for the weekly Mobile meeting
[11:01:54] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ agcolom gseguin RWhitbeck toddmparker
[11:02:03] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:02:07] <gseguin> here
[11:02:13] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:02:19] <gseguin> hiya
[11:02:30] <uGoMobi> agenda/updates https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HwutfNryfreC2yc_nrIISClqedR2GGNy_T8-HQP5bok/edit#
[11:03:56] <uGoMobi> last time we use this document, I will create a new one so we can use the same doc every week
[11:04:52] <arschmitz> hi
[11:04:56] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:05:04] <agcolom> hey
[11:05:11] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[11:05:17] <uGoMobi> ok let's start
[11:05:34] <uGoMobi> 1.4 final
[11:05:44] <uGoMobi> let's ship this thing!
[11:05:50] <_|Nix|_> Amen!
[11:06:24] <uGoMobi> one open ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6794
[11:06:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you take care of that?
[11:06:52] <arschmitz> already did
[11:07:01] <arschmitz> not sure why that didnt auto close
[11:07:16] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:07:36] <gseguin> We could almost use the Release script for 1.4
[11:07:37] <arschmitz> oh i miss typed the issue number
[11:08:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah, maybe need to reopen a ticket then :)
[11:08:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: cool
[11:08:37] <uGoMobi> gseguin: but I guess almost means we can use it for next release?
[11:08:54] <gseguin> yes definitely
[11:09:00] <uGoMobi> right :)
[11:09:04] <gseguin> I'm really close
[11:09:10] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:09:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So does that mean we actually build the release JS/CSS via DB?
[11:09:34] <gseguin> no
[11:09:44] <_|Nix|_> Oh ... I thought that was the goal.
[11:09:52] <gseguin> we're going to use jquery-release
[11:10:14] <gseguin> maybe DB is going to use jquery-release as well, I haven't been following
[11:10:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So are we still gonna have issues with file order in the release vs. db?
[11:10:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and we are going to use UI's download builder in the future
[11:10:39] <uGoMobi> probably as from 1.5
[11:10:57] <arschmitz> these are completely seperate things
[11:11:09] <arschmitz> one is just the release script generic for all jquery projects
[11:11:28] <uGoMobi> right
[11:11:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's the problem ... the release script (whatever it is) places files in a different order than the DB.
[11:12:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is a difference between the build and the release script
[11:13:58] <gseguin> the release script delegates building of the artifacts to the current build system
[11:14:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Aaah, OK.
[11:14:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So we still need to fix the same things as before.
[11:14:29] <gseguin> correct
[11:14:41] <uGoMobi> shall we focus on the 1.4 final release now
[11:14:46] <gseguin> it just automate the release process and publishing to CDN
[11:14:49] <gseguin> ok
[11:14:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: +1
[11:15:50] <uGoMobi> so I am done with new jquerymobile.com, only few things to do for the about page
[11:15:59] <uGoMobi> I can finish that after the meeting
[11:16:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have the complete changelog ready?
[11:16:34] <arschmitz> thats taking a bit longer with the manual cleen up then i expoected
[11:16:42] <arschmitz> it was 2,500 lines
[11:16:52] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine
[11:16:56] <arschmitz> im almost down to 1000
[11:17:32] <arschmitz> but hope to finishes very shortly
[11:19:05] <uGoMobi> the 1.4.0 RC1 changelog is missing
[11:19:32] <uGoMobi> was thinking, maybe we can use that one first and then replace by the complete changelog when you are done
[11:20:56] <uGoMobi> might be good to have a changelog with only the highlights as well anyway
[11:21:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you copy the 1.4.0 RC1 changelog from the blog post to the site?
[11:21:53] <agcolom> yes
[11:22:03] <uGoMobi> only thing is that blog post is html and site is md
[11:22:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok great
[11:22:20] <agcolom> I'm used to that, it's manageable ;-)
[11:22:24] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:22:41] <agcolom> When would you need it? (I can do it tomorrow morning)
[11:22:44] <agcolom> is that ok?
[11:23:08] <agcolom> I can try this evening, but I'm not sure yet...
[11:24:15] <uGoMobi> was hoping we can release today
[11:24:24] <gseguin> uGoMobi: would work for me
[11:24:38] <agcolom> ok. I'll try.
[11:24:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but I can take care of it if
[11:25:00] <uGoMobi> ...if you can't make it
[11:25:04] <agcolom> what sort of time?
[11:25:23] <agcolom> I need to see if it's an easy one...
[11:25:25] <uGoMobi> I don't want to put the changelog in the blog post but link to it
[11:25:32] <agcolom> sure
[11:26:34] <agcolom> this one: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/10/24/jquery-mobile-1-4-0-rc1-released/
[11:26:35] <agcolom> ?
[11:26:51] <agcolom> if that;s the one, it'll be quick. I can probably do it now...
[11:26:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah
[11:27:01] <agcolom> ok. I'll get to that now...
[11:27:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was looking here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog
[11:27:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that should be the same, and already in md
[11:27:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: just have to check if changes we made after beta 1, before RC 1, are in there
[11:28:05] <agcolom> ok
[11:28:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what's the status of the API docs?
[11:28:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks!
[11:29:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I completed one rebase, but now I'm following scott_gonzalez' advice and doing another rebase where I look at each commit in turn - very time-consuming
[11:29:43] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I already have this one: http://stage.jquerymobile.com/changelog/1.4.0-beta.1/ so I just need to add the rc1 to it, right?
[11:29:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm looking at all commits that are common to 1-3 and 1-4, and re-ordering commits so that the common ones come first.
[11:29:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[11:30:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when do you think you can finish that?
[11:30:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *sigh* ... not really sure ... probably today or tomorrow.
[11:31:01] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:31:45] <_|Nix|_> Quick question: The carat-* icons are new in 1.4, right?
[11:32:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, carat is what use to be arrow
[11:32:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arrow is now real arrows
[11:32:20] <_|Nix|_> OK, so the commits related to that need not be re-ordered.
[11:32:54] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:33:14] <uGoMobi> one more thing we need to look at for the API docs is the front page
[11:33:34] <uGoMobi> that is now in jquery-wp-content
[11:33:43] <uGoMobi> with PHP to set the version
[11:33:45] <_|Nix|_> Right ... it says "1.3.0 API Documentation" ..
[11:34:23] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:34:47] <uGoMobi> anyways, there are some places where 1.3 is hardcoded in there
[11:35:01] <uGoMobi> not a big thing, but we should not forget to do that
[11:35:06] <uGoMobi> then the demos
[11:35:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: can you add the /demos/ directory?
[11:36:01] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I can't add that in the repo I think
[11:39:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you know how we shoud do this?
[11:39:21] <uGoMobi> demos are now on view.*
[11:39:28] <arschmitz> ill check with scott_gonzalez
[11:39:35] <uGoMobi> we need to move those to jquerymobile.com/demos/
[11:39:37] <arschmitz> make sure its done the right way
[11:39:56] <uGoMobi> with 1.4.0/1.3.2/1.2.1/1.1.2/1.0.1 subdirectories
[11:40:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[11:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L99
[11:40:32] <agcolom> uGoMobi: the changelog for rc1 is for the whole of the 1.4 release? (so contains alpha1, alpha2, beta1 also?)
[11:41:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: for the alpha and beta changelog we made sections
[11:41:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: to show what was changed after each release
[11:41:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: is it possible to do the same for RC1?
[11:41:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so it is clear what has been changed after beta 1
[11:42:43] <agcolom> sure
[11:42:52] <uGoMobi> great
[11:43:36] <agcolom> so as http://stage.jquerymobile.com/changelog/1.4.0-beta.1/
[11:43:44] <gseguin> uGoMobi: what do you mean?
[11:43:45] <agcolom> with an addition for rc1?
[11:43:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[11:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> That's kind of silly, since it's just duplicating data if you do that.
[11:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> Why would you want to duplicate a changelog 4 times?
[11:45:12] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: so you don't have to go over all 4 of them
[11:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> So why not just have /changelog/1.4.0/ which you update with each pre-release.
[11:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> And at the end, it's just a normal changelog.
[11:46:26] <uGoMobi> right, makes sense
[11:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, you'll end up with the 1.4.0-alpha.1 changelog in 5 different documents.
[11:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> a1, a2, b1, rc1, final
[11:46:55] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:47:22] <uGoMobi> we never published the changelog on the site
[11:47:30] <uGoMobi> only in blog posts
[11:47:41] <uGoMobi> that's where this is coming from
[11:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> gotcha
[11:47:56] <agcolom> uGoMobi: if I look at the blog post for rc1, there is nothing that wasn't already in the previous releases
[11:47:57] <uGoMobi> but it's a good idea to just have one changelog
[11:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> Core still doesn't have changelogs on their site :-/
[11:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> So you're ahead of them there :-)
[11:48:37] <uGoMobi> didn't we fix anything after beta 1? :/
[11:48:47] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: thanks, good to know :)
[11:49:10] <agcolom> uGoMobi: the blog post is about new features, changes, deprecation
[11:49:24] <agcolom> and removal
[11:49:27] <agcolom> no fixes
[11:49:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I'll check after the meeting
[11:50:07] <agcolom> ok. so the beta1 changelog already contains everything from the blog posts
[11:50:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there is a change of plan... we are going to delete the alpha/beta/rc changelogs and just have one 1.4.0 changelog
[11:50:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great, then we can use that one
[11:50:40] <agcolom> ok, no problem
[11:50:52] <agcolom> I can do that...
[11:50:54] <uGoMobi> and I'll check what we have been doing after beta 1
[11:50:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok thanks
[11:51:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if I find something I can add it
[11:51:24] <uGoMobi> ok back to demos
[11:51:30] <agcolom> so all goes into one, without subgheadings?
[11:52:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't mind to keep subheadings
[11:52:16] <agcolom> ok. and the date for 1.4 is today?
[11:52:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think it might be useful for people that are developing with 1.4 as from alpha
[11:52:33] <agcolom> sure
[11:53:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: looks like we can't publish the API docs today
[11:53:15] <uGoMobi> so I am not sure
[11:53:37] <agcolom> ok... well, we can always change the date when we know what it is
[11:53:44] <uGoMobi> right
[11:54:14] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I was talking about moving the demos from view.jquerymobile.com to jquerymobile.com/demos/
[11:54:55] <uGoMobi> and demos for each version in a subdirectory
[11:56:02] <uGoMobi> my question is if we can just create those on the server
[11:56:07] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I think it's already the case
[11:56:37] <gseguin> uGoMobi: each version has a directory under /demos/
[11:56:49] <gseguin> not sure how well they work
[11:56:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:56:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: is that the case for new site also?
[11:57:06] <gseguin> Where is the new site?
[11:57:20] <uGoMobi> it's on the jquerymobile.com repo
[11:57:23] <gseguin> oh it's using jquery-content?
[11:57:28] <uGoMobi> didn't deploy to stage
[11:57:38] <uGoMobi> because I don't have the keys
[11:57:57] <uGoMobi> (and I need to push the about page first)
[12:00:32] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: when I want to add the 1.4 final release blog post, can I only do that after we switched to the new site?
[12:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, that should wait until the new site is live.
[12:01:51] <uGoMobi> ok no problem
[12:02:43] <uGoMobi> I am thinking about if we should release tomorrow morning (ET)
[12:02:56] <uGoMobi> don't really like to release on Fridays
[12:03:10] <uGoMobi> but really want to get it out
[12:03:14] <uGoMobi> any opinions?
[12:03:30] <_|Nix|_> Nah ... Monday.
[12:03:45] <_|Nix|_> IMO ...
[12:04:22] <arschmitz> either way is fine with me
[12:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> I also vote for Monday over Friday.
[12:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> Especially with new sites going live.
[12:05:04] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:05:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you finish the complete changelog before Monday?
[12:06:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: can you look into /demos/ with scott_gonzalez and arschmitz ?
[12:06:03] <arschmitz> yes
[12:06:30] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:06:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we will release on Monday, so if you were rushing now... stop rushing :)
[12:07:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you have the API docs ready by Monday?
[12:07:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll do my utmost.
[12:08:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Remember, they're ready now, but the commit history is not so nice-looking.
[12:08:10] <uGoMobi> I will take care of the homepage for the API docs
[12:08:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi: no problem :-)
[12:09:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The sole purpose of my excercise is to mop up the commit history and distill changes that also apply to 1-3.
[12:09:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[12:09:38] <uGoMobi> but it needs to be done before we merge 1-4 in master
[12:09:57] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[12:10:16] <_|Nix|_> So, I'll most likely have it done by Monday.
[12:10:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great
[12:10:56] <uGoMobi> anything else regarding the 1.4 final release that we need to discuss now?
[12:11:58] <uGoMobi> I think we are done here
[12:12:02] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[12:12:05] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
