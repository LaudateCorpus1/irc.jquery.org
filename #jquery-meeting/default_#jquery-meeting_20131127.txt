[09:01:21] <arschmitz> im here
[09:01:24] <rxaviers> Hello
[09:01:31] <kborchers> yo
[09:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Any AMD/builder updates?
[09:04:20] <tj_vantoll> I'm here now.
[09:04:49] <rxaviers> On download builder, we currently have two milestones:
[09:05:06] <rxaviers> 1st Support jQuery UI 1.11,
[09:05:07] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues?milestone=3&state=open
[09:05:12] <rxaviers> 2nd UI + Mobile
[09:05:17] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues?milestone=2&state=open
[09:05:20] <rxaviers>  
[09:05:57] <rxaviers> the AMD/builder updates for "Support jQuery UI 1.11" is pretty much ready, except for the renamings
[09:05:58] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/156
[09:06:09] <arschmitz> rxaviers: we discussed mobile road map today and the goal for mobile will be our 1.5 release
[09:06:14] <rxaviers> (renamings = jquery.ui.* -> *)
[09:06:41] <arschmitz> rxaviers: you have css working?
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> What about CSS comment support?
[09:07:18] <rxaviers> arschmitz, CSS comment support is not a requirement for jQuery UI 1.11. But, it is a requirement for UI+Mobile
[09:07:20] <rxaviers> ops
[09:07:25] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, CSS comment support is not a requirement for jQuery UI 1.11. But, it is a requirement for UI+Mobile
[09:07:39] <rxaviers> arschmitz, what's the plan? Have 1.5 using the same DB as UI?
[09:07:55] <arschmitz> yes
[09:08:03] <rxaviers> when is 1.5 going to happen?
[09:08:21] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is that clear? do you agree?
[09:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> Hmmm....I suppose that's true, though I'd like to use CSS comments in 1.11.
[09:08:59] <arschmitz> rxaviers: probably may or june
[09:09:14] <rxaviers> arschmitz, ok no problem. I guess we'll have UI+Mobile done by then.
[09:09:35] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Hm. Could we postpone that?
[09:10:24] <rxaviers> Or, I don't know how long do you want to wait until 1.11
[09:10:36] <rxaviers> s/do//g
[09:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> The CSS is just hard-coded based on component names right now?
[09:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> If so, I think that's fine.
[09:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> We'll put the comments in even if they're not being used yet.
[09:11:13] <rxaviers> right
[09:11:13] <rxaviers> ok
[09:11:22] <rxaviers> good point
[09:12:33] <tj_vantoll> So the next step is to actually do the renames?
[09:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like it.
[09:14:17] <rxaviers> Anyway, I had few progress on DB. I've been more focused on Globalize / CLDR / moment.js
[09:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> Renames and land the UMD stuff.
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer wrote a script that does the renaming.
[09:14:55] <tj_vantoll> Is there anything holding us back from landing that?
[09:15:04] <rxaviers> Is anyone going to do the renames? I have talked to JÃ¶rn about it, and I will do it locally on my end to check possible conflicts with the AMD PR. But, I dont know what the rename plan.
[09:15:33] <rxaviers> s/plan/plan is
[09:15:33] <scott_gonzalez> Was just waiting until DB could fully handle it.
[09:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> Which it sounds like it can now.
[09:15:59] <tj_vantoll> Seems like we could do it in the UMD branch.
[09:16:09] <rxaviers> ah ok. So, yeah go ahead. DB will handle the renames and AMD just fine
[09:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let's do it in there.
[09:16:23] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the CSS filenames also change
[09:16:24] <rxaviers> Great, better than.
[09:16:27] <rxaviers> then*
[09:16:42] <rxaviers> (jeez so many typos)
[09:17:07] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok.
[09:19:48] <jzaefferer> So that sounds like it can land pretty soon
[09:20:10] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: can you just apply by rename script on the umd branch and check the result? If you need help with the script, let me know
[09:20:18] <scott_gonzalez> Finally getting this into master will be great.
[09:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> Although it'll make every PR conflict.
[09:20:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sure, will let you know on any trouble
[09:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> Don't forget not to commit the script itself :-P
[09:21:10] <jzaefferer> I'd like to land selectmenu with the native menu option asap; we can fix bugs in master as well and continue working on the native menu option in parallel. The issues there aren't in the API, so I don't think that should hold as back any further
[09:21:31] <jzaefferer> Yeah, don't add new files; the script uses `git mv` anyway
[09:21:34] <tj_vantoll> LAND ALL THE THINGS
[09:21:57] <tj_vantoll> git mv is pretty smart, the PRs will conflict but will be easy to resolve.
[09:22:02] <tj_vantoll> *in theory*
[09:22:07] <jzaefferer> maybe land selectmenu in master before the UMD stuff? Otherwise we'll have to apply that to selectmenu seperately
[09:23:04] <fnagel> jzaefferer: just to make sure: merge branch selectmenu or selectmenu-native-menu?
[09:23:11] <jzaefferer> selectmenu
[09:23:16] <fnagel> right
[09:23:41] <jzaefferer> the native-menu option isn't ready, but I didn't see anything there that requires us not to land in master
[09:23:52] <tj_vantoll> Landing selectmenu first makes sense to me.
[09:24:03] <jzaefferer> in other words, we can add that option after 1.11, in time for mobile 1.5
[09:24:04] <tj_vantoll> The order seems easier to resolve.
[09:24:18] <fnagel> Sounds good to me
[09:24:19] <arschmitz> fnagel: im going to make some time this coming week to do a bunch of mobile testing on selectmenu
[09:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:24:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any reason against `git merge selectmenu` right now?
[09:25:03] <jzaefferer> fnagel can continue 'maintenance' in master
[09:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> Do we want to look through the history at all or just merge the whole thing?
[09:25:36] <fnagel> arschmitz: Would be great, I really need some feedback. Tried some other ideas without success...
[09:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> Probably just merge the whole thing, right?
[09:26:01] <arschmitz> fnagel: no problem i wanted to do it this week but just didnt have time
[09:26:08] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: So history is not available trough GitHub, right?
[09:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[09:26:27] <tj_vantoll> Probably not worth the effort to try to clean up the history at this point. imo
[09:26:48] <fnagel> I would like to have the history somewhere else, not only local
[09:26:56] <jzaefferer> I once tried a rebase of the selectmenu branch, needs manual conflict resolution
[09:27:06] <jzaefferer> so I'm for a merge commit as well
[09:27:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:27:15] <jzaefferer> retains everything
[09:27:30] <arschmitz> i think merging is inevitable on really long lived branches
[09:27:58] <fnagel> ok
[09:28:10] <jzaefferer> fnagel: with `git merge selectmenu`, every commit from the `selectmenu` branch will live on in master
[09:29:25] <fnagel> jzaefferer: I'm aware. Sorry, perhaps I just misunderstood, still pretty sick
[09:29:56] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:30:09] <jzaefferer> do you want the honours yourself?
[09:31:03] <fnagel> No, just go ahead.
[09:32:36] <tj_vantoll> I can take care of merging in and reviewing the API docs.
[09:33:03] <fnagel> The branch for selectmenu API is not updated since a few month, sorry
[09:33:22] <tj_vantoll> That's fine. I can work on getting it up to date.
[09:33:37] <fnagel> I could do it too, but not before weekend
[09:34:14] <tj_vantoll> Ok. I'll see what I get to and we can go from there.
[09:34:28] <fnagel> Sounds good!
[09:36:11] <scott_gonzalez> I cherry-picked a bunch of commits from master to 1-10-stable.
[09:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> I just need to do a dry run of the release, then we can do the 1.10.4 release.
[09:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> That'll probably happen next week.
[09:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> Once 1.10.4 is out, I'm going to work on 1.9.3.
[09:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm mostly just concerned with supporting newer versions of core.
[09:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> For example, getting this into 1-9-stable: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2ca4d17982bfedc723f499b41e0936ada9eaa852
[09:37:28] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: okay; the API docs probably still mention anchors, need to remove those
[09:38:00] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: will do
[09:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> I reviewed the tooltip a11y PR last week after the meeting.
[09:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1118
[09:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> Dylan made some updates, but didn't comment, so I didn't see the changes till just now.
[09:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'll review the updates today and hopefully it's ready to land.
[09:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Button update?
[09:39:12] <arschmitz> yup
[09:39:28] <arschmitz> i pushed my first pass at updating the widget to new markup
[09:39:48] <arschmitz> everything is working but there are still a few things i need to update as well as tests
[09:40:12] <arschmitz> i also pushed some examples of css and markup for checkbox and radio
[09:40:22] <arschmitz> as well as created a doc with suggested api
[09:40:45] <arschmitz> actually same doc as for button https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFD_Y9QuuMTI4NOc-JQYRjPTrcVV52h7ZeLKLPbSj40/edit
[09:41:18] <arschmitz> for checkbox examples http://view.jqueryui.com/button/demos/button/checkbox.html
[09:42:21] <arschmitz> and if anyone wants to play with http://view.jqueryui.com/button/demos/button/options.html and see if they notice any function issues there or places where different option combos are conflicting or anything
[09:42:46] <arschmitz> also http://view.jqueryui.com/button/demos/button/icons.html
[09:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> Why are the icon options "left" and "end"
[09:44:19] <arschmitz> oh i need to fix that sorry
[09:44:27] <arschmitz> left is just default should be begining
[09:44:52] <arschmitz> but there is no actual class for it if you dont put a class thats what you get
[09:45:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:46:34] <arschmitz> the radio dots look a little off to me but i cant figure it out so im going to ask uGoMobi to look
[09:48:17] <arschmitz> any one have any comments or suggestions about the api?
[09:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> Everything looks good so far.
[09:50:04] <tj_vantoll> It seems sane. One thing I'm curious about - is the concept of a buttonset going away?
[09:50:08] <arschmitz> awesome ill start working on the checkbox radio widget this week then
[09:50:20] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: no it will be replaced by controlgroup
[09:50:32] <arschmitz> adapted from mobile
[09:50:36] <tj_vantoll> Ok that makes sense.
[09:50:56] <arschmitz> basicly same thing but supports selects too
[09:51:34] <jzaefferer> Can iconPosition have "start" and "end" or similar RTL-compatible values?
[09:51:40] <jzaefferer> Instead of "left" and "right"
[09:51:58] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: they actually are thats my fault on the demo
[09:52:12] <arschmitz> the classes and code use those
[09:52:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: pointed that out before i need to fix it
[09:52:33] <jzaefferer> About input[type=radio/checkbox] for button: Are you suggesting to automatically apply a different widget? I wonder if its better to throw an error when you apply button to these
[09:53:10] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: im not following
[09:53:43] <jzaefferer> Should .button() call .checkbox() when button is applied to type=checkbox?
[09:53:52] <jzaefferer> or should .button() just throw an error in that case
[09:53:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: oh i had not thought about that
[09:54:07] <jzaefferer> the text checkbox here doesn't seem to work: http://view.jqueryui.com/button/demos/button/options.html
[09:54:12] <arschmitz> but i would say button should throw an error
[09:54:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: did you set an icon first
[09:54:39] <jzaefferer> yes
[09:54:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: for radio I don't use icons anymore
[09:55:04] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: your right sorry ill check on that
[09:55:21] <uGoMobi> just border-radius and 4px border or something like that
[09:55:40] <arschmitz> i changed a class for that i must not have updated the demo after
[09:56:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome ill look at that and update
[09:57:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: problem might be that in UI you can set custom icon color
[09:58:35] <arschmitz> ok
[09:59:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that means you have to set background and border color of the radio :after pseudo element to similar colors
[09:59:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right
[10:00:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: are there approriate theme colors for this already something to use for icon color and the icon background color?
[10:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> We only have the widget, content, focus, hover, active states.
[10:01:18] <arschmitz> hmm we will have to figure out what to do for these colors.
[10:02:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: the icon color is not somewhere in the css?
[10:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> It is, but it's based on the location and state.
[10:02:52] <uGoMobi> we use the active state for radio on
[10:04:03] <uGoMobi> just to set different border color
[10:05:00] <arschmitz> we can probably figure this out in -dev
[10:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's move this to -dev.
[10:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
