[08:56:37] <jzaefferer> test
[08:56:40] <jzaefferer> nice
[08:56:47] <ryanneufeld> Mic check
[08:57:01] <jzaefferer> Testing Team meeting starting in 4!
[08:58:20] <johnbender> estoy aqui
[08:59:35] <jzaefferer> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FbWhiFQ9gWQvB1Tm4QM_OC4me-ha2ujDWH5sdF7ueo/edit
[09:00:10] <jzaefferer> ping scott_gonzalez gnarf DaveMethvin
[09:00:14] <jzaefferer> apparently not Timo or Rick
[09:00:56] <jzaefferer> To start with some good news: QUnit 1.10.0 is out
[09:01:05] <jzaefferer> jQuery UI is already update
[09:01:07] <jzaefferer> *updated
[09:01:16] * johnbender makes a todo
[09:01:21] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin landed the patch to restore the reset behaviour, so Core should be good to update, too
[09:01:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll put that in after 1.8.1 ships
[09:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> here
[09:02:00] <jzaefferer> UI needed that for tooltip tests: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/7852583980decd716f6c2ed37b1e1d7705332989 <- johnbender might be something you need for mobile, too
[09:02:18] <johnbender> checking
[09:02:34] <johnbender> I'm sure we do
[09:02:56] <jzaefferer> there are some new tickets, but nothing need much discussion, mostly looking for input from the reporter. So would like to review some old ones, where I'm not going to resolve them without some input
[09:03:12] <jzaefferer> like the parallel execution issue: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/253
[09:03:24] <jzaefferer> or sandboxing: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/173
[09:03:49] <jzaefferer> any opinions, ideas, interest?
[09:04:45] <johnbender> I was originally excited about implementing both of those with iframes but I think there are some issues there with the way our tests interact with them that make it ... tough
[09:04:54] <jzaefferer> I don't see them addressing any immediate issue, and that's pretty muchall I care about..
[09:04:58] <johnbender> that is, my excitement has been dampened
[09:05:05] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:05:07] <jzaefferer> that's something
[09:05:26] <jzaefferer> considering our experience with iframes and TestSwarm, we probably don't want to introduce more iframes
[09:06:00] <jzaefferer> so I'd just close them both
[09:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[09:06:36] <johnbender> fair enough
[09:06:43] <jzaefferer> Meanwhile, there was this discussion about deprecating module, renaming to group or suite: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/190
[09:08:19] <johnbender> hmm
[09:08:27] <johnbender> I'd say flip a coin on those
[09:08:44] <johnbender> preference here for "suite"
[09:08:54] <johnbender> thought that has it's own semantic issues
[09:08:57] <johnbender> *its
[09:08:59] <DaveMethvin> oh so fancy pants, group sounded good to me
[09:09:01] <DaveMethvin> or bundle
[09:09:05] <DaveMethvin> lump
[09:09:11] <johnbender> *though
[09:09:17] <jzaefferer> so the only reason for renaming module was that commonjs also has module property
[09:09:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:09:28] <jzaefferer> but that doesn't really stop you from using QUnit at least within nodejs
[09:09:37] <DaveMethvin> it's just a confusing terminology thing
[09:09:37] <jzaefferer> as far as I could tell so far...
[09:09:50] <jzaefferer> I'd rather stick with module
[09:10:06] <DaveMethvin> well then stick with it! we'll back you up jzaefferer
[09:10:24] * DaveMethvin tells everyone jzaefferer nixed it
[09:10:32] <johnbender> jzaefferer: what's the solution for the commonjs folks?
[09:10:39] <johnbender> just undef it on window and use QUnit.
[09:10:42] <johnbender> ?
[09:10:43] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/issues/43
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The probem is bad environment detection, not collisions.
[09:11:20] <jzaefferer> also https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS/issues/91
[09:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is not that QUnit will fail in any environment, it's that people will detect web sites using QUnit as a CommonJS environment because a global module exists.
[09:12:36] <johnbender> unfortunate
[09:12:41] <jzaefferer> yeah, thats a good description of the problem
[09:12:55] <johnbender> but definitely seems like a <1% problem :/
[09:12:59] * scott_gonzalez wonders what code I use to detect environments...
[09:13:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: so just tell people to fix their codes?
[09:13:03] <jzaefferer> heh
[09:13:10] <johnbender> though I feel like that's easy to say since I'm not dealing with it
[09:13:19] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah, don't fix it unless MY code breaks!
[09:13:25] <jzaefferer> QUnit itself looks for "exports", then attaches itself to that
[09:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/figlet-js/blob/master/figlet.js#L13
[09:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> I apparently use exports as well.
[09:13:50] <DaveMethvin> i'm not dealing with it either .. no dog in this fight
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'd honestly just ask Isaac what he thinks is best.
[09:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> or Tim Caswell.
[09:14:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you do that? You seem to have a good track record there :-)
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:15:38] <jzaefferer> then we can close with "Isaacs thinks you're wrong"
[09:15:52] <jzaefferer> that should end the discussion :p
[09:16:42] <jzaefferer> Meanwhile, do we need more docs here? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/127
[09:17:00] <jzaefferer> The new site has the minimal markup covered, pretty much all examples are updated
[09:18:13] <jzaefferer> I guess I'll just assume its cool, until someone complains about lack of documentation regarding the markup.
[09:18:45] <DaveMethvin> doesn't everyone take a working page and copy/paste it? :D
[09:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> That is a long discussion...
[09:18:51] <jzaefferer> prolly, yeah
[09:18:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: nevermind
[09:19:05] <jzaefferer> most of it is about generating qunit-fixture
[09:19:30] <jzaefferer> so while Timo is back, he apparently didn't make it here
[09:19:51] <jzaefferer> I guess I need to visit him at home and set a bi-weekly alarm or something
[09:20:01] <jzaefferer> we should have actual TestSwarm updates in two weeks
[09:20:27] <jzaefferer> also going to launch some nice updates for qunitjs.com and api.qunitsj.com soon
[09:21:00] <jzaefferer> pretty much all I have - anything else?
[09:21:12] <jzaefferer> johnbender: how's testswarm and browserstack working for mobile?
[09:21:51] <johnbender> jzaefferer: it works great, just need to get the IE issues figured out :/
[09:21:54] <johnbender> seriously though
[09:21:56] <johnbender> it's amazing
[09:22:07] <DaveMethvin> core still needs to get our unit tests a little more reliable
[09:22:10] <jzaefferer> IE issues, really? :-)
[09:22:12] <DaveMethvin> too many ajax fails
[09:22:14] <johnbender> most of them are the "won't fail while looking at them" bugs
[09:22:16] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:22:30] <jzaefferer> heisenbugs!
[09:22:43] <johnbender> we had those in FF but it was the location.hash bug
[09:22:55] * johnbender grumbles about FF decoding the hash
[09:23:14] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:24:00] <jzaefferer> well, thanks everyone
[09:24:14] <johnbender> thank you!
[11:02:25] <toddparker> Hi all

[11:02:57] <toddparker> Hi uGoMobi and MauriceG
[11:03:14] <toddparker> (MauriceG - looks like we'll have a few more changes for our beta commit log)
[11:03:25] <MauriceG> yes
[11:03:43] <MauriceG> I can "pull" them in if you want
[11:03:55] <toddparker> are JasonDScott, johnbender, gseguin here?
[11:04:02] <toddparker> MauriceG: that would be great
[11:04:12] <MauriceG> toddparker: okay
[11:04:20] <toddparker> maybe wait until tomorrow so we can merge in the popup branch
[11:04:24] <toddparker> thanks!
[11:04:39] <MauriceG> k
[11:04:50] <toddparker> MauriceG: is your last name "Gottleib"
[11:05:15] <johnbender> here
[11:05:27] <toddparker> hey johnbender
[11:05:28] <MauriceG> toddparker: no   not again ...   Gottlieb  (are you kdding?)
[11:05:45] <toddparker> just checking :)
[11:05:49] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:05:49] <toddparker> for the notes
[11:05:50] <johnbender> hahahaha
[11:06:12] <toddparker> my brian isn't to be trusted
[11:06:17] <toddparker> ok, i'll start off
[11:06:21] <toddparker> 1.2 Beta Status - It’s taken a lot of time to work around some really frustrating browser bugs but as of today, all blocker issues with WP7 and Android have been addressed in the popup-simple branch. This branch also includes some code simplification of the history tracking since popup stacking isn’t supported.
[11:06:44] <toddparker> Please help us test today before we land in master for beta later today: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/index.html
[11:06:59] <toddparker> we're testing in our main lab and the the rest of the team is on it too
[11:07:05] <toddparker> the more testing help the better
[11:07:15] <toddparker> if this checks out, it will go into master late today
[11:07:26] <toddparker> at that stage, we're ready for beta methinks
[11:07:38] <toddparker> Here is a rundown of the worst bugs we’ve been wrestling with:
[11:07:49] <toddparker> 1. Visual z-index issues in Android 4.0 default browser (#4816 and #4874) - When fixed toolbars were used on a page, the use of any position:fixed elements cause havoc with rendering of stacked elements in Android. In these situations, the popup would visually appear *under* the overlay but was still clickable so this was a display bug. This issues was addressed by adding conditional logic that will toggle the toolb
[11:07:49] <toddparker> from position:fixed to position:absolute when the popup is opened and closed. The drawback to this fix is fixed toolbars appear to hide when a popup is open, but this workaround is only applied to only to Android 4.0 and will only been seen if there are fixed toolbars and popups with an overlay theme.
[11:08:03] <toddparker> 2. Animating overlay opacity bug in Android 4.0 Chrome (#4915) - The CSS-based fade in/out transition on the themed overlay causes similar visual stacking bugs as fixed toolbars in Chrome. This was addressed by removing the fade behavior on the overlay. Testing revealed that not animating the opacity of the overlay made the popup display significantly faster so this change is now applied across the board. The overla
[11:08:04] <toddparker> now pops into place without a transition and adding a transition isn’t offered as an option.
[11:08:19] <toddparker> 3. Wild scrolling in WP7.5 when closing a popup (#4784) - When closing a popup in WP7, the window would scroll to random locations. Turns out this was due to a bug in WP7’s history management that would not correctly remember the scroll position when we used the history and hashchange to close the popup. After spending over a week looking at possible solutions, the team has determined that this can not be worked
[11:08:20] <toddparker> around. To address this bug, we have excluded just WP7 from back button support with popups so these must be closed by clicking outside the popup or using a developer-supplied close button. We also had to handle the close button behavior to work without hashchange to work with this situation. The option to track history has been exposed as the “history” option now in the popup API:
[11:08:21] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/options.html
[11:08:33] <toddparker> Multiple button focus states in WP7 - Multiple buttons would get the focus state as popups were opened and closed. Also related to WP7’s buggy history implementation and fixed by excluding them from history.
[11:08:40] <toddparker> (#4)  ^^
[11:08:48] <toddparker> Targeting 1.2 beta mid next week at the earliest with a RC soon after
[11:08:57] <toddparker> roadmap under way
[11:09:11] <toddparker> that's my update. sorry for the verbosity
[11:09:46] <toddparker> any Q's before we head onto other foks?
[11:10:07] * uGoMobi is still reading
[11:11:36] <uGoMobi> no questions here
[11:12:02] <toddparker> it's been a hellish 2 weeks of trying to work around terrible browsers
[11:12:33] <toddparker> but we landed in a  solid place, all things considered
[11:12:42] <toddparker> alright…jojohnbender - what's up
[11:12:48] <uGoMobi> maybe we should change the goal of this project to developing the perfect mobile browser :)
[11:12:49] <johnbender> popups yo
[11:12:52] <johnbender> I worked on them
[11:12:54] <johnbender> alot
[11:12:58] <toddparker> heh
[11:13:00] <johnbender> seems like we're in a good place
[11:13:25] <johnbender> the seem easier to change now
[11:13:33] <johnbender> at least with regards to nav
[11:13:40] <toddparker> yeah
[11:13:44] <johnbender> Wilto will have to be the judge of that
[11:13:53] <toddparker> i appreciate all the help on popups this week
[11:14:11] <johnbender> my pleasure
[11:14:20] <johnbender> I spent a bit of time working with DaveMethvin on perf too
[11:14:25] <Wilto> Sorry; late the the party as usual.
[11:14:26] <johnbender> he was exceptionally helpful
[11:14:34] <johnbender> "above and beyond"
[11:14:34] <toddparker> yeah, where did we land with that. you made some changes
[11:14:47] <johnbender> I messed around with some button markup stuff
[11:14:56] <johnbender> but I'll save it until we have a way to test/verify it
[11:15:02] <johnbender> and maintain the results
[11:15:11] <toddparker> DaveMethvin always is a champ
[11:15:33] <toddparker> so those changes aren't in master
[11:16:01] <johnbender> no
[11:16:09] <johnbender> button-data-access
[11:16:37] <toddparker> gotcha
[11:17:04] <johnbender> ah
[11:17:13] <johnbender> *awww I was going to add that stuff to the doc
[11:17:14] <johnbender> sorry
[11:17:16] <johnbender> :(
[11:17:25] * johnbender is a lazy bones
[11:21:08] <toddmparker_> hey, lost my connection again
[11:21:14] <uGoMobi> welcome back
[11:21:22] <toddmparker_> thanks :)
[11:21:26] <toddmparker_> what did i miss?
[11:21:33] <uGoMobi> nothing at all
[11:21:46] <toddmparker_> do you want to go uGoMobi
[11:21:49] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:21:52] <toddmparker_> saw you maybe found a bug?
[11:22:04] <uGoMobi> just tested popup-simple branch on Android 4.0.4. native browser + Chrome, issues:
[11:22:04] <uGoMobi> native browser: go to popups page in the docs > go to one of the advanced examples pages > open and close a popup > click "back to popups" link .... the url doesn't change
[11:22:04] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4898 (is the plan to disable scrolling?)
[11:23:00] <toddmparker_> 4898 is from 3 days ago - guessing that's master?
[11:23:13] <Wilto> Rechecking that now. I don’t know that it’s still an issue.
[11:23:18] <uGoMobi> I tested on popup-simple branch
[11:23:47] <toddmparker_> and you're seeing both issues or just that 2nd?
[11:24:15] <uGoMobi> both
[11:24:20] <toddmparker_> hmm
[11:24:47] <toddmparker_> re: (is the plan to disable scrolling?)
[11:25:10] <uGoMobi> I thought I saw johnbender mentioning that
[11:25:16] <Wilto> Oh, nope, busted.
[11:25:29] <uGoMobi> so I wasn't sure what is the expected behaviour
[11:26:11] <toddmparker_> we were thinking about trying to prevent scrolling if you had a popup with an overlay theme so it was more modal-esque and would open faster b/c you're not creating a huge overlay
[11:26:20] <toddmparker_> we determined this si going to be really complex
[11:26:37] <uGoMobi> strange thing: on the native browser... open popup in portrait > switch to landscape and back with popup still open > you can't scroll anymore
[11:26:38] <toddmparker_> so we're not going to do this for 1.2
[11:26:48] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:27:03] <toddmparker_> this 4.0 or 4.1?
[11:27:09] <uGoMobi> 4.0
[11:27:44] <uGoMobi> fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4856
[11:27:44] <uGoMobi> fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4835
[11:27:49] <uGoMobi> just for the record
[11:27:58] <uGoMobi> fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4663 (we need to test on JB to see if John’s fix can be reverted:
[11:28:01] <toddmparker_> yeah, you closed some good issues!
[11:28:10] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b668b6006967354111f62caf96db37d63052bb52
[11:28:23] <uGoMobi> that was johnbender his JS fix
[11:28:37] <toddmparker_> ok, we can test that today
[11:28:47] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:29:01] <uGoMobi> last...
[11:29:02] <uGoMobi> Opera transitions: don’t work because Opera doesn’t suppport 3D-transforms at all
[11:29:02] <uGoMobi> created a branch on my forked repo with transitions for IE10 (unprefixed)
[11:29:20] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi:
[11:29:22] <toddmparker_> right
[11:29:35] <toddmparker_> seems like opera's trasitions are still lacking
[11:29:51] <uGoMobi> about that last one... we would have to adjust the 3D-transforms and CSS transitions supports checks
[11:29:51] <toddmparker_> the n-prefixed would be good to add, probably for 1.2.1
[11:30:05] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[11:30:08] <uGoMobi> because they don't take unprefixed into account
[11:30:10] <toddmparker_> why's that?
[11:30:15] <toddmparker_> ah, gotcha
[11:30:26] <uGoMobi> will give that a look later
[11:30:39] <uGoMobi> they work good on IE10 if I bypass that
[11:30:51] <toddmparker_> great
[11:31:01] <uGoMobi> that's it
[11:31:48] <toddmparker_> Cool. Think everyone who is here has chimed in....
[11:32:01] <Wilto> I blame Mike Taylor personally for the Opera thing.
[11:32:05] <Wilto> I’ll be sending him an angry letter.
[11:32:28] <uGoMobi> I blame myself for not checking that first
[11:34:12] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I'm checking that 4.0 issue now...let's talk on dev
[11:34:18] <toddmparker_> Any questions from the community?
[11:34:37] <toddmparker_> ...
[11:34:54] <Wilto> Don’t be shy, Community.
[11:34:58] <toddmparker_> Ok, thanks all. We're targeting beta mid next week now
[11:35:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: Wilto: did you see this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4863
[11:35:17] <uGoMobi> I forgot to mention it
[11:35:31] <Wilto> uGoMobi: I BELIEVE TODD SAID GOOD DAY, SIR
[11:35:51] <toddmparker_> bah. rounding bugs.
[11:35:57] <Wilto> _Rounding bugs_.
[11:35:59] <uGoMobi> :/
[11:36:03] <toddmparker_> let's chat in dev
[11:36:06] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:36:08] <Wilto> Yeah; I can look into it.
[11:36:08] <toddmparker_> you can't fight math uGoMobi
[11:36:19] <Wilto> OR CAN WE?
[11:36:22] <Wilto> (No.)
[11:36:27] <uGoMobi> Mat?
[11:36:30] <toddmparker_> it will always divide us
[11:36:36] <uGoMobi> who is Mat?
[11:36:41] <uGoMobi> :D
[11:36:49] <Wilto> I wonder sometimes myself.
[11:36:58] <Wilto> Some kid that’s mad about images on the internet or something.
[11:37:03] <toddmparker_> GOOD DAY SIR
[11:37:18] <toddmparker_> Don't make me say it thrice.
[11:37:24] <Wilto> oh damn
[11:37:38] <toddmparker_> Signing off!
