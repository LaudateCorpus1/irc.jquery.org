[09:00:41] <fnagel1> Hey there
[09:00:43] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:18] <jzaefferer> Tag
[09:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with AMD.
[09:02:29] <tj_vantoll_phone> Here now
[09:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers put together a PR to get some discussion going.
[09:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029
[09:02:33] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (20h 54m ago): AMD support
[09:02:53] <rxaviers> hi there, sorry Im a little late
[09:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably ping some community members to discuss some of this.
[09:03:41] <rxaviers> yeap, that would be definitely good
[09:03:44] <tj_vantoll_phone> Is the plan to try to get AMD into 1.11?
[09:03:56] <jzaefferer> let's ping jburke on the AMD PR?
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll_phone: yup
[09:04:14] <jzaefferer> I'm sure he's happy to not having maintain his jqueryui-amd project anymore
[09:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> Pinged jburke, Alex Sexton, and Greg Franko.
[09:05:05] <jzaefferer> Nice
[09:05:22] <tj_vantoll_phone> Cool. Yeah I don't understand UMD enough to get most of that.
[09:05:31] <rxaviers> The build process is based on modernizr. We are using requirejs to calculate dependencies and build the bundle (having UMD wrappers removed in the final bundle)
[09:06:03] <rxaviers> requirejs config parameters are hard to understand before a good read at the docs. They are not very trivial.
[09:06:26] <rxaviers> Current PR has working build
[09:06:32] <rxaviers> `grunt build` and see it working
[09:07:00] <rxaviers> it's building jquery-ui.js and i18n/jquery-ui-i18n.js
[09:07:17] <tj_vantoll_phone> I'm assuming that build will have to be done in DB correct?
[09:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> yah
[09:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to verify that everything is working properly on its own and with Bower.
[09:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> But we can keep that discussion in -dev and the PR.
[09:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything specific they want to discuss right now about AMD or Bower?
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> If not, we'll move on to the next topic.
[09:14:18] <jzaefferer> We're not publishing the built files in bower anyway, right?
[09:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[09:14:32] <jzaefferer> Where "publishing" currently is "tagging a detached branch"
[09:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz and I have been working through changes in jQuery Mobile to make it possible to just drop in any 3rd party widget and have it work.
[09:16:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: since you just update the build task, will this require any changes in DB?
[09:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> For example, this file should become unnecessary: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/tabs.js
[09:16:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that's a work in progress?
[09:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz is working through the changes.
[09:16:56] <arschmitz> Should have time to finish that up this weekend if nothing else comes up
[09:17:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, currently DB does not use UI build tasks. But, since the UI files now have wrappers and the build is different, yes we need to change the DB's builder as well.
[09:17:44] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay. Will it reuse some of these changes? Or does it have to reimplement them?
[09:18:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, reimplement
[09:18:48] <jzaefferer> okay. Those regex replacements seem like something we wouldn't want to maintain in multiple places
[09:19:54] <rxaviers> ok, Im open to suggestions. But, that's because we wanted DB not to use jquery-ui previously.
[09:20:04] <rxaviers> (jquery-ui's build)
[09:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> We might be able to just drop the build task.
[09:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> If I remember correctly, we only have it for size comparisons.
[09:21:06] <rxaviers> yeap, correct
[09:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> And I'm more concerned about size comparison within a single file than the entire build.
[09:21:33] <jzaefferer> Uh, okay. So we just move the replace stuff to DB or drop it in UI?
[09:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can do that.
[09:21:53] <rxaviers> sounds good to me
[09:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll double check our grunt tasks and if it seems ok, I'll just remove the concat process.
[09:24:16] <jzaefferer> okay, sounds good
[09:24:51] <jzaefferer> We don't have anything for icons or topcoat, do we?
[09:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> I think grunticon just landed in Mobile.
[09:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> Presumably with the changes I discussed during the Mobile meetings.
[09:25:49] <arschmitz> indeed it has
[09:25:56] <arschmitz> with changes
[09:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> So we need to figure out how we're making the transition.
[09:26:20] <arschmitz> on that though the support test can make qunit fail in phantom
[09:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> Can you link to the support test?
[09:27:49] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.support.js#L65
[09:28:04] <arschmitz> its because it uses a data uri
[09:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> huh, .hasFeature()?
[09:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't that a useless function?
[09:29:56] <kborchers> hey have to take off â€¦ if you need anything from me, just mention me and i'll respond later in -dev
[09:30:47] <arschmitz> i had not even noticed it was in there this was written buy the guys at filament
[09:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/feature-detects/svg/asimg.js
[09:32:14] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, uGoMobi, gseguin|away, team, one last thing still on the AMD naming question... To keep consistency it's probably good that mobile and UI have the same naming pattern. So, it would be good to have mobile eyes on the loop
[09:32:38] <rxaviers> (in case you need the direct link https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029#discussion_r5227950)
[09:32:38] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (21h 24m ago): AMD support
[09:32:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[09:33:02] <uGoMobi> (oops didn't see you were already here arschmitz )
[09:33:19] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: looks like the same test but with out that big pretty much
[09:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably do icons and CSS framework changes at the same time for UI.
[09:35:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ill see if i can catch the guys from filament and see what exactly the need is for that first big thats not taken care of by the modernizer test
[09:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:37:03] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: this is the source for the inlineSVG test https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/tasks/grunticon/static/grunticon.loader.js
[09:38:06] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: looks like hasFeature was added there with this commit https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/commit/2a1ee2e00844a087f838c6089d268b232bab5ca7
[09:38:06] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Jeffrey Lembeck (1mon 2w ago): Adding a bugfix for early firefox, which supported svg, but not svg in img - http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-img
[09:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Does "early firefox" mean super old unsupported versions?
[09:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> Because that table is showing 3.6 as the only red version.
[09:39:41] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: it does sound like that
[09:40:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: from modernizer ...
[09:40:17] <arschmitz> // Assumes data URI support, but according to caniuse every browser which
[09:40:18] <arschmitz>   // supports SVG in an <img> also supports data URIs
[09:40:19] <b-ot> arschmitz: Sorry, I can't find anything on every+browser+which
[09:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yup, I saw that comment.
[09:40:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: grunticon browser support: https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/#browser-testing-results-for-icon-output
[09:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> Sems silly.
[09:41:44] <arschmitz> so it seems like we could switch to the modernizer test for our purposes
[09:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: You should see if that helps with phantom.
[09:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> Even if it doesn't, if that check is unnecessary, we should definitley remove it.
[09:45:38] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i will but pretty sure it wont its setting img.src that causes it
[09:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and fnagel1 looked into the Mobile selectmenu plugin and have decided that we'll continue with what we currently have in UI.
[09:46:13] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll be reviewing that soon so we can merge into master.
[09:46:26] <arschmitz> seen other projects complaining about same thing https://github.com/tildeio/oasis.js/issues/6
[09:46:27] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6 by lukemelia (1mon 2w ago): Qunit tests do not run under phantom.js
[09:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> ghetto
[09:46:57] <fnagel1> I really hope we will merge selectmenu to master asap
[09:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:50:47] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: anything on CLDR?
[09:51:05] <rxaviers> nope this week
[09:51:49] <fnagel1> nope
[09:52:06] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you're going to work on that again this week?
[09:52:48] <tj_vantoll_phone> I removed the jQuery template dependency from the datepicker rewrite branch.
[09:53:18] <tj_vantoll_phone> Going to work on implementing the multiple month picker on top of that.
[09:53:53] <jlembeck> scott_gonzalez: that was browser support for early versions of firefox, yes
[09:53:57] <jlembeck> 3.6 and before, I believe
[09:54:07] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, if it has higher priority than AMD thing I definitely could
[09:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> jlembeck: Why?
[09:54:32] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: nah, AMD goes into 1.11, globalize/cldr doesn't, so that's fine
[09:54:39] <rxaviers> ;)
[09:54:45] <jlembeck> it was a change to grunticon, which has support on all browsers
[09:54:47] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll_phone: cool
[09:54:52] <jlembeck> (as many as we can, at least)
[09:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like that's it for today.
[09:58:03] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:58:39] <jzaefferer> *wink*
