[08:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:00:07] <kborchers> in a meeting again â€¦ just ping me though if you need something
[09:00:42] <tj_vantoll> Yo
[09:02:38] <rxaviers> hey
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to start with anything AMD/DB related?
[09:03:40] <rxaviers> well, nothing new this week. I was waiting review of UI and DB respective PRes
[09:03:48] <rxaviers> respective's*
[09:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ok
[09:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I know you have at least one thing you want to discuss.
[09:04:24] <rxaviers> This week I have worked on Globalize, CLDR
[09:05:19] <mikesherov> hi
[09:06:25] <tj_vantoll> Only some trivial progress on datepicker. I want to go through all the current options and decide if we're going to keep them, deprecate them, or remove them http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker. There are a lot of options.
[09:06:57] <mikesherov> Deprecate for 1 release, right?
[09:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: We can get through at least some at the conf.
[09:07:12] <mikesherov> or are we skipping some of that for datepicker?
[09:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> We're probably skipping some for datepicker.
[09:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker's API is massive is crazy.
[09:07:30] <tj_vantoll> Yeah it's hard to say.
[09:07:45] <tj_vantoll> That's why I wanted to go through the list to get a handle on exactly what we're dealing with.
[09:08:30] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I won't be in Austin. But I'll be free most of the day if we wanted to do Skype / hangout / whatever.
[09:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok.
[09:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, after the conf, I'll definitely have more time for UI.
[09:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> Still hoping to at least get to selectmenu or AMD/DB before the conf, but I kept pushing off this keynote to get the plugins site done.
[09:09:49] <tj_vantoll> Sweet.
[09:10:02] <tj_vantoll> 8/12 in Austin is when we're meeting with the mobile guys right?
[09:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> 9/12, but yes.
[09:10:46] <tj_vantoll> :)
[09:11:27] <tj_vantoll> Ok, cool, I should be available.
[09:11:42] <tj_vantoll> The other thing I wanted to discuss is https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/164
[09:11:43] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Issue #164 by tjvantoll (3d 23h ago): Missing `jQuery` return type for several methods
[09:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so this is tricky.
[09:12:07] <tj_vantoll> $( ".selector" ).dialog( "open" )
[09:12:09] <tj_vantoll> vs
[09:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> We want to start documenting other methods that are public API, but not jQuery-ish API.
[09:12:28] <tj_vantoll> myDialog.open();
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/20
[09:12:32] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #20 by jzaefferer (13mon 3w ago): Document non-standard public methods
[09:13:02] <mikesherov> hmm
[09:13:44] <mikesherov> i'm in favor of tj_vantoll's proposed plan
[09:13:48] <tj_vantoll> So the question is should the docs for methods like open() say that they return a jQuery object (which they do via plugin invocation) or nothing (which they do from a direct method call)?
[09:14:09] <tj_vantoll> Yeah that plan was what we discussed in Portland.
[09:14:53] <mikesherov> well, it seems to me like the docs should have the ability to specify return type per signature, no?
[09:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> They do. But the only thing documented is the .widget( method ) version.
[09:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> We don't document instance.method() anywhere.
[09:16:40] <scott_gonzalez> We could probably do something like: Returns: jQuery when called as a jQuery method
[09:16:41] <mikesherov> right, so then that solves that. We document the direct calls, right?
[09:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> And have it link to a page that explains this.
[09:16:53] <mikesherov> right
[09:16:58] <tj_vantoll> And really that's why I created this issue; the docs are all for the plugin invocation route so it seems like the return type that matches.
[09:17:00] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I like that.
[09:17:09] <mikesherov> very cool
[09:17:12] <tj_vantoll> jQuery (via plugin)
[09:17:38] <tj_vantoll> jQuery (<a href="page-that-explains-it">plugin only</a>)
[09:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, do you want to document that in the issue?
[09:18:27] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'll take care of that.
[09:18:31] <tj_vantoll> Sounds like a plan.
[09:18:32] <scott_gonzalez> Are you comfortable working with the XSLT or do you want me to tackle the implementation?
[09:19:24] <tj_vantoll> Semi comfortable. This isn't a high priority thing though.
[09:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:19:50] <tj_vantoll> I could work on a quick page that explains the two ways of invoking widget methods. Should that live on learn?
[09:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...either learn or a page (not entry) on api.jqueryui.com.
[09:21:43] <tj_vantoll> I was leaning towards learn because this seems like something mobile would run into as well.
[09:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> Learn is probably the best.
[09:23:40] <tj_vantoll> That's all I have.

[09:23:53] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Issue #164 by tjvantoll (3d 23h ago): Missing `jQuery` return type for several methods
[09:24:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok. rxaviers: Anything specific to discuss regarding CLDR/Globalize?
[09:25:38] <rxaviers> I'm implementing date formats
[09:25:58] <rxaviers> And the CLDR tricks (like inheritance) as a separate module
[09:26:54] <rxaviers> My plan is get this code done (minimum working stuff) and show it to you guys to say what you think
[09:28:18] <rxaviers> Im trying to keep the Globalize public API as closer as possible to existing (only changing it internally)
[09:29:21] <rxaviers> Let me clarify my first two sentences... (a) I'm implementing date formats (on globalize)...  (b) Implementing CLDR inheritance as a separate module.
[09:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> If there's a public API change that makes sense, please bring it up. We don't *have* to stay API compatible.
[09:30:00] <rxaviers> ok
[09:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone in -dev.
[09:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
