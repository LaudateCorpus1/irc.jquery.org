[09:03:08] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: oh yeah forgot enjoy
[09:04:05] <arschmitz> however if its just fnagel and i probably not worth having a meeting
[09:05:08] <fnagel> hehe
[09:05:30] <fnagel> So, no meeting today?
[09:05:52] <arschmitz> fnagel: not that i wouldn't be happy to talk to you just not sure how productive of a meeting it would be lol
[09:06:31] <fnagel> true
[09:06:56] <jrossi2> I'm here, not opposed to canceling though
[09:07:09] <arschmitz> jrossi2: hey
[09:07:11] <fnagel> I'm currently waiting for Scotts rebase of datepicker branch  so I've got nothing to discuss anyway
[09:07:28] <fnagel> * calendar branch
[09:07:30] * rxaviers is present now
[09:07:40] <arschmitz> ok well there are a few people now
[09:07:42] <jrossi2> Err ... Today is Wednesday
[09:07:49] <arschmitz> jrossi2: yup
[09:07:55] <arschmitz> but we love you on UI too
[09:07:56] * jrossi2 notes topic and face palms
[09:08:04] <arschmitz> :-)
[09:08:35] <arschmitz> i just have 2 things worth putting on the record i suppose
[09:08:48] <arschmitz> Core is going to revert the offset changes we talked about last week
[09:09:22] <arschmitz> so i can fix the one minor other break and once they do that we will be green on core git again
[09:10:10] <arschmitz> and for the accessibility issue we wanted input fro the webaim group on the response was ... mixed
[09:10:27] <arschmitz> one person said it should click one said it shouldnt and one had no idea what we were talking about lol
[09:10:43] <arschmitz> so we will need to talk about that more when there are more people
[09:10:55] <arschmitz> rxaviers: did you have anything?
[09:11:58] <rxaviers> nope. I am on standby if you guys have any questions for me
[09:13:39] <arschmitz> ok well i guess thats it then
[09:13:43] <arschmitz> thanks everyone
[09:13:47] <arschmitz> :-)
[09:13:50] <arthurvr> bye everyone
[09:14:40] <fnagel> bye guys
