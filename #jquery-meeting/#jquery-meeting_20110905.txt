[09:02:06] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[09:02:12] <jaubourg> hey Dave
[09:02:26] <DaveMethvin> figured i'd hang out here altho i don't think we have a meeting since its a holiday
[09:02:49] <jaubourg> yep, thought the same
[09:03:12] <DaveMethvin> so did you see the bug filed on ajax last night?
[09:03:28] <DaveMethvin> the data property gets lost on a GET request?
[09:03:42] <jaubourg> yep and it's on purpose
[09:04:00] <jaubourg> so that you can re-use the options map
[09:04:18] <DaveMethvin> by that point does the url have the data on it?
[09:04:24] <jaubourg> yes
[09:04:40] <DaveMethvin> well then, it needs to be in one place or the other but not both
[09:04:50] <DaveMethvin> i guess we need to document that
[09:06:07] <jaubourg> you got time to look into unit testing in xhtml doc mode?
[09:06:40] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately not today
[09:07:15] <DaveMethvin> so did you have some ideas on how we might do it without server side code? I know you mentioned some experiments you did but i've never seent hem
[09:07:17] <jaubourg> heh, the trick seems to have the browser handle the file with the correct mimetype... should be index.xhtml probably?
[09:07:29] <DaveMethvin> that works for firefox i know
[09:07:35] <DaveMethvin> not sure about the others
[09:07:40] <jaubourg> oh, my experiments were all with server-side logic
[09:08:10] <DaveMethvin> seems like the two are different enough that we need to run the unit tests in both ways
[09:08:24] <DaveMethvin> rather than just switch to xhtml for example
[09:08:27] <jaubourg> probably, but then comes the problem with testswarm
[09:08:52] <DaveMethvin> why can't people just accept that xhtml was a well intentioned but failed experiment? :)
[09:08:59] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:11:05] <DaveMethvin> i guess we should hang out in -dev so I'm moving over there jaubourg
[09:21:38] <gnarf> are we drunk yet?
