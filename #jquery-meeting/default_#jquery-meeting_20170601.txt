[14:05:01] <bcochran> Hi.  I haven't seen any new commits to the jquery-mobile repo since January.  Is there a plan to have jQuery developers begin working on the project again?  If so, please share when.
[14:07:55] <apsdehal__> hi @bcochran , we already pushed all the code related to 1.5 to master
[14:08:06] <apsdehal__> We were working on documentation from then on.
[14:08:24] <cogwurx> WOO!
[14:08:52] <apsdehal__> It is currently in alpha, so we are testing it and waiting for people to open up issues/regressions
[14:09:22] <apsdehal__> cogwurx: hi
[14:09:34] <apsdehal__> I see no one else is here
[14:09:38] <cogwurx> hello!
[14:10:08] <apsdehal__> Haven't seen cgack and jaspermdgroot for quite a while
[14:10:09] <cogwurx> yeah, it's been pretty quite around here on Thursdays
[14:10:42] <apsdehal__> arschmitz: There?
[14:10:44] <cogwurx> cgack I think is in the work trenches and was on a trip recently...let me see if I can ping him
[14:10:58] <cogwurx> I've not seen jasper in ages
[14:14:04] <bcochran> I'm going to try to help out.  Looking at documentation / demo site now.  Will also take a look at refreshing the Grunt tasks & dependencies.   I put this up the other day and will strengthen it as things move along.
[14:14:28] <apsdehal__> I guess I will need to talk to arschmitz later about deployment of api. I accidentally forgot to push the tag for latest version
[14:14:28] <bcochran> mindchasers.net/dev/install-jqm-demos
[14:14:58] <apsdehal__> bcochran: that would be really great and helpful.
[14:15:16] <apsdehal__> But keep in mind the version deployed on api.jquerymobile.com is not the current
[14:15:39] <bcochran> I'm working from the master branch, which is basically the same as the 1.5 apha 1 tag.  Correct?
[14:15:44] <apsdehal__> You may need to clone and run it. I will work with arschmitz on that, and get latest deployed asap.
[14:15:49] <apsdehal__> Yes, for main repo.
[14:16:09] <apsdehal__> Also for api repo. But I am talking about the website api.jquerymobile.com
[14:16:33] <apsdehal__> Code hasn't been deployed there so it shows old documentation for widgets
[14:16:41] <bcochran> I'm testing the demo site that is embedded in the master jquery-mobile repo.   This seems to be what is on the jQuery demo site under master.  Please confirm
[14:16:57] <apsdehal__> Yes, that one is good to go.
[14:17:07] <apsdehal__> You can test on that.
[14:17:14] <bcochran> Thanks for the info on the api site.  I'll double check what I'm looking at.
[14:17:45] <bcochran> Thanks for the feedback.  I need to step away for a few.  I'll be back before the hour to see if anyone posted towards me.
[14:18:03] <apsdehal__> Thanks a lot for helping out.
[14:19:59] <apsdehal__> Btw cogwurx, really liked your new designs on your website
[14:20:11] <apsdehal__> *I really
[14:20:21] <cogwurx> !!
[14:20:24] <cogwurx> Thank you!
