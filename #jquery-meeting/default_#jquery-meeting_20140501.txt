[11:00:37] <gseguin> hi
[11:01:14] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:01:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom told me she couldn't make it to todays meeting
[11:01:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ cgack
[11:02:45] <arschmitz> hi
[11:02:52] <uGoMobi> is today an official holiday in the US?
[11:03:13] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:03:23] <iskren> uGoMobi,  I don't think so
[11:03:35] <arschmitz> no
[11:03:36] <uGoMobi> iskren: ah ok, thanks
[11:03:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, it's a holiday in Spain too?
[11:03:45] <iskren> rxaviers, hey, there is another meeting according to the http://meetings.jquery.org/ calendar
[11:03:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[11:04:03] <rxaviers> hi iskren, yeap let's use the meeting2 again
[11:04:09] <rxaviers> sorry mobile
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> np
[11:04:13] <arschmitz> rxaviers: no problem
[11:05:00] <gseguin> get off my lawn!
[11:05:03] <gseguin> ;)
[11:05:13] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:05:19] <gseguin> so what's up ?
[11:05:25] <uGoMobi> before we start talking about planning of 1.5 development... any other things we need to discuss?
[11:05:43] <_|Nix|_> Just the one issue.
[11:05:49] <gseguin> nothing specific here
[11:05:53] <uGoMobi> right, autogrow
[11:06:05] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, so can we get rid of the code that sets the height to 0?
[11:06:22] <_|Nix|_> Now that we set overflow to hidden anyway, I don't think it's needed anymore.
[11:06:24] <cgack> hey, i made it
[11:06:26] <uGoMobi> for the record https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6801#issuecomment-36438918
[11:06:29] <uGoMobi> hey cgack
[11:06:46] <_|Nix|_> If the height is a little wrong, that's fine, as long as the text can be seen in its entirety.
[11:07:07] <_|Nix|_> Like, I mean, no lines half-cut-of, no text jumping, etc.
[11:07:29] <uGoMobi> whatever we do, we have to test it thorough on multiple browsers
[11:07:34] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, exactly.
[11:07:39] <uGoMobi> autogrow have been bit of a pain
[11:07:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: speaking of that
[11:07:45] <_|Nix|_> So, that'll require serious device testing.
[11:07:55] <uGoMobi> autoshrink actually
[11:08:00] <arschmitz> i just got a new device testing setup that emulates scrolling clicks and forminput
[11:08:10] <arschmitz> this sounds like a perfect chance to try it out
[11:08:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! Cool!
[11:08:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean, like, servos and stuff?
[11:08:32] <arschmitz> nope
[11:08:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does it involve robots? ;)
[11:08:37] <arschmitz> sorry i wish
[11:08:46] <arschmitz> though have talked to ryanneufeld about building those
[11:09:30] <arschmitz> this just does it though event capture and a websocket
[11:09:42] <arschmitz> so its a node proxy that injects the script
[11:10:00] <gseguin> rwaldron had whipped up a quick proto, at the dev summit. I wonder if he's aware of people doing it for serious
[11:10:23] <arschmitz> then on any device showing that page it captures the events sends them through the socket to all the other pages and triggers them
[11:10:41] <_|Nix|_> Oh, cool!
[11:10:56] <arschmitz> the clicking could be a lot better
[11:11:06] <arschmitz> but other then that its awesome clicks on many things dont work
[11:11:36] <uGoMobi> nice
[11:11:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That might be the browser implementation too, though.
[11:11:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Synthesizing a click is no small matter.
[11:11:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah not sure just saying clicking is far from perfect
[11:12:04] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:12:12] <arschmitz> scrolling and forminput are good though
[11:12:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, bottom line being this can speed up device testing, right?
[11:12:34] <arschmitz> and it might be our widgets too like select menu works collapsible does not flipswitch works radio does not
[11:13:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess it might be.
[11:13:14] <arschmitz> not that we should worry about this
[11:13:45] <arschmitz> but its a mighty cool testing tool
[11:14:06] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:14:08] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I'll write a PR for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6801 removing the resize-to-0 code, and let's test.
[11:14:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[11:14:45] <uGoMobi> yeah, if tests show we can do without I am fine with it
[11:15:03] <arschmitz> also on the matter of browser testing
[11:15:14] <arschmitz> im working on setting up browserstack-runner
[11:15:23] <arschmitz> might be easier then testswarm
[11:15:50] <arschmitz> that also gives us testing on devices for unit tests for stuff like this
[11:15:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Whew! That'll do a number on our tests :) It's all for the better though :)
[11:16:03] <gseguin> arschmitz: can you share that in a branch so I can take a look ?
[11:17:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: i dont have it working local yet but jzaefferer has using my setup
[11:17:08] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'd definitely be interested in helping out with the effort
[11:17:11] <arschmitz> lol so something is up with my computer
[11:17:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: awesome
[11:17:26] <arschmitz> to start im doing chrome only
[11:17:32] <arschmitz> and adding a single testpage at a time
[11:18:02] <arschmitz> and we can add them one at a time trying to keep it green or fixing it
[11:18:14] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:18:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: jzaefferer thinks our timeouts might cause issues
[11:19:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the ones we added to make the dialog tests pass?
[11:19:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: but if we eliminate dialog tests and move sequence tests to casper it wont be as bad
[11:19:15] <uGoMobi> dialog nav tests I mean
[11:19:28] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:19:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just in general for nav
[11:19:35] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:19:50] <gseguin> and it would stabilize travisCI
[11:19:54] <arschmitz> but even if we just do unit tests its better then nothing
[11:20:03] <uGoMobi> true
[11:20:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does casper allow you to expect events?
[11:20:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i havent used it much yet gseguin might know better
[11:20:35] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: DOM events?
[11:21:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah. Right now the sequence tests are mostly, like, do this, expect popupopen, then do that, then expect popupclose.
[11:21:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Sometimes they test for the absence of an event.
[11:21:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: i.e., you must not receive such an event when you do this, otherwise it's broken.
[11:22:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's where the long timeouts come from.
[11:22:10] <gseguin> yup, I'm pretty sure you can do that
[11:22:15] <_|Nix|_> OK, great!
[11:22:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should try to re think those tests
[11:22:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, might be worth the effort.
[11:23:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I would prefer that they remain hands-off though, i.e. integration tests.
[11:23:10] <arschmitz> waiting for something to not happen is generally not a good way to go
[11:23:58] * gseguin agrees with that statement
[11:24:03] * uGoMobi too
[11:24:20] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but if you don't have that, your test is one-sided.
[11:24:25] <_|Nix|_> Spurious events are bad too.
[11:24:57] <arschmitz> an event is just a symptom though
[11:25:01] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you can make sure that an event was not triggered during your test
[11:25:09] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: but you shouldn't wait for that
[11:25:11] <arschmitz> we should be checking for whats causing the problem
[11:25:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we can instrument $.fn.trigger ...
[11:25:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, that's probably the way to go.
[11:26:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah we can discuss that later but we should look at tests that wait for an event not to happen and re think them in general
[11:26:57] <arschmitz> and if most of those are sequence tests we can address it with the move to use casper for those
[11:27:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make that part of $.testHelper.detailedEventCascade()
[11:27:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bet casper does exactly that, if it allows you to test for the absence of an event.
[11:27:53] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ... a lot to think about.
[11:27:55] <uGoMobi> like arschmitz said, this is something to discuss later
[11:28:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, instrueah.
[11:28:04] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[11:28:06] <_|Nix|_> Yeah
[11:28:25] <uGoMobi> let's talk a bit about 1.5
[11:28:39] <gseguin> darn, I have to step out for a bit
[11:28:44] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok
[11:28:54] <uGoMobi> roadmap http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/
[11:29:36] <uGoMobi> I think finishing widget review should get highest priority
[11:29:59] <uGoMobi> I am just not sure about how much more time we should invest in current panel widget
[11:30:27] <cgack> there are a good deal of panel issues i've seen
[11:30:44] <uGoMobi> cgack: yes, there are :(
[11:30:56] <_|Nix|_> ... but those are 1.4.x, right?
[11:30:59] <_|Nix|_> ... if they're bugs.
[11:30:59] <uGoMobi> so we want to rewrite the widget from scratch
[11:31:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: many of the things for 1.5 are done already
[11:31:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Fixing the bugs might give us the tests we need to put the rewrite through its paces.
[11:31:32] <arschmitz> tools adopt release script is done
[11:31:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[11:31:46] <_|Nix|_> Can we put a checklist in there?
[11:31:54] <arschmitz> events: review swipe what that was originally about is in 1.4.2
[11:31:56] <_|Nix|_> ... or is that more of a wiki thing.
[11:32:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can put it in the agenda doc
[11:32:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not bad.
[11:32:28] <uGoMobi> wiki page is also an option
[11:32:41] <arschmitz> remove style options is essentially a non task
[11:32:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's a doc task.
[11:33:06] <arschmitz> datepicker wont be ready
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> selectmenu wont be ready enough
[11:33:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and we must provide turn-it-off classes for things that default to true.
[11:33:33] <arschmitz> menu maybe spinner is pretty much done in a jsbin somewhere
[11:33:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think that might just be corners, and maybe shadow.
[11:33:52] <arschmitz> autocomlete will take some work but would be great
[11:34:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That'll put filterable out of business, right?
[11:34:27] <arschmitz> tests, selectmenu, are underway already
[11:34:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: kinda sorta not really
[11:34:54] <_|Nix|_> Riiight ... *scratch head*
[11:35:04] <arschmitz> name space is like a one line change
[11:35:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its more about data binding then filtering
[11:35:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aha! OK.
[11:35:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: namespace - we need to also check the non-namespaced data-* options.
[11:35:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That'll kill performance :/
[11:35:58] <arschmitz> ok so anyway what does this leave us for 1.5
[11:36:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im thinking a setting and you get one or the other never both
[11:36:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well then that's a non-issue as well.
[11:36:43] <arschmitz> its kinda cheating as far as deprecation but i dont want to take that kinda perf hit
[11:36:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We already have such a setting: $.mobile.ns
[11:36:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: true
[11:37:02] <arschmitz> all we are doing is setting it to ui-
[11:37:08] <arschmitz> instead of ""
[11:37:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can simply document that it will be set to "ui" as of 1.6.0.
[11:37:12] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[11:37:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: `ui-`
[11:37:22] <_|Nix|_> Right, right.
[11:37:36] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, "get yo shite together, folks!'
[11:37:37] <arschmitz> that dash is actually really important :)
[11:37:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, I know, I know :)
[11:38:06] <arschmitz> ok anyway so we are left with review of widgets
[11:38:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The namespace thing needs to feature prominently in announcements, changelogs, migration guides, API docs, etcv.
[11:38:23] <arschmitz> and navigation which is what select and dialog stuff is leading to already
[11:39:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[11:39:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: for navigation we should start with a document
[11:39:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another sort of nav-related thing would be to completely break up navigation.js. Like, remove click handlers, for example, and make them a module that need not necessarily be present.
[11:40:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah there is a ton of stuff to do with it this will be an ongoing process
[11:40:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It has enormous implications. It goes into, like, transitions and stuff.
[11:40:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but to start we need to essentially finish pagecontainer
[11:40:46] <_|Nix|_> It's super-interdependent.
[11:41:17] <arschmitz> once we have pagecontainer as a solid basis to build on we can move into the rest
[11:41:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed. We can't start this without getting our page events in a row.
[11:41:58] <arschmitz> also we need to finish navigate
[11:42:16] <arschmitz> and make it possible to control when things are added to the history stack or not added
[11:42:39] <arschmitz> those are the two starting points we need to solidify an api around
[11:42:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we want to support non-one-to-one-mapping of our own concept of history and browser history?
[11:43:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what do you mean like to allow internal history that disagrees with browser history that is still navigable?
[11:43:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[11:43:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That'd be too much work, IMO.
[11:43:53] <arschmitz> no
[11:44:04] <arschmitz> the only thing close will be widget back button support
[11:44:34] <arschmitz> if we want to do that without using the hash
[11:44:56] * gseguin is back
[11:45:10] <arschmitz> replace state should do it but i seem to recall an issue with replacestate with same page in some browser
[11:45:51] <arschmitz> something we will just have to try
[11:45:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think github does it with PRs. If you click discussion vs. commits vs. changes, it doesn't add a new history item.
[11:46:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they use hash though
[11:46:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The URL changes, but it's not a new history entry.
[11:46:19] <arschmitz> right thats replace state
[11:46:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but if you replace state without changing the url
[11:46:45] <arschmitz> it does something weird in some browser i think i just cant remember what
[11:46:50] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see.
[11:47:04] <arschmitz> maybe its an old one we dont support any more :)
[11:47:12] <_|Nix|_> Here's hoping :)
[11:47:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although if it supports replaceState it can't be that old.
[11:47:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: firefox 4 did
[11:48:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. I withdraw my previous statement :)
[11:49:08] <arschmitz> ok so back on track 1.5 and widget review
[11:49:18] <arschmitz> the point i was trying to make is once you cross all that other stuff off
[11:49:22] <uGoMobi> so in short... the main things we have to work on are the widget reviews and pagecontainer and other nav stuff
[11:49:26] <arschmitz> there is not much left besides widget review
[11:49:32] <_|Nix|_> I just stumbled across https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6568
[11:49:38] <_|Nix|_> ("Remove buttonMarkup")
[11:49:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does not have a 1.5 project yet
[11:50:14] <_|Nix|_> I was thinking about reviewing table.
[11:50:23] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[11:50:35] <_|Nix|_> Get rid of those wheels-within-wheels-within-wheels.
[11:50:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cleaning that up is big i like that widget but the code is horrible
[11:51:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: after that we can work on navbar together
[11:51:13] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Cool!
[11:51:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll give 'er all she's got, captain!
[11:51:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so depending on time for that and if we get any other people hankering for a project ( cgack hint hint :) )
[11:52:01] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:52:01] <arschmitz> maybe we could start refactoring panel
[11:52:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually we should start we removing deprecated code
[11:52:23] <cgack> I was about to raise my hand and say I could find something to look at
[11:53:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that was what I was wondering too, but we might have to deprecate things first
[11:53:06] <_|Nix|_> There will come a time when someone will report an issue and fixing it for 1.4.x will be a completely different changeset from fixing it in 1.5.0.
[11:53:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe cgack and you could start navbar now too thats a pretty simple one maybe a better place to get started
[11:53:49] <_|Nix|_> Actually, removing filterable.backcompat alone might be quite a task.
[11:54:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[11:54:08] <_|Nix|_> ... because you need to remove tests with it, and remove stuff from the API docs as well.
[11:54:22] <arschmitz> and depending on how tables and that go we can evaluate then about panel
[11:54:54] <cgack> I'm up for navbar. A nudge to get started off right might be nice :)
[11:55:07] <uGoMobi> cgack: awesome
[11:55:08] <arschmitz> panel might have to be something thats started soon but ends up in 1.6
[11:55:20] <arschmitz> cgack: start with a google doc or wiki page
[11:55:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we have to rewrite for 1.7
[11:55:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can flatten it in 1.5, then add data-enhanced for 1.6, then rewrite for 1.7.
[11:55:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and _setOptions() somewhere in-between.
[11:55:57] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:56:13] <uGoMobi> not sure if that's efficient
[11:56:18] <arschmitz> cgack: outline the api what public methods and options it should have
[11:57:05] <arschmitz> cgack: something kinda like http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/71756381/Button
[11:57:25] <arschmitz> or http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[11:57:52] <cgack> arschmitz: awesome thanks
[11:57:52] <arschmitz> just either in a github wiki on the jquery-mobile repo or in a google doc
[11:58:40] <arschmitz> cgack: and try to put your self in the mind set of not careing what is there now but what SHOULD be there for an api
[11:58:52] <arschmitz> and we can worry about backcompat after
[11:59:04] <cgack> cool
[11:59:11] <_|Nix|_> I'll file an issue for table review. I can't find one.
[11:59:32] <arschmitz> cgack: you should open one for navbar if there is not too
[11:59:41] <arschmitz> and link the doc to that
[11:59:54] <cgack> roger
[12:00:06] <arschmitz> i suppose now that we can do attachment you could even just do it in an issue
[12:00:13] <arschmitz> thoughts uGoMobi _|Nix|_ gseguin ??
[12:00:31] <arschmitz> a little more public that way
[12:00:38] <arschmitz> then our tendency to use google docs
[12:00:51] <gseguin> the public-er the better
[12:01:03] <uGoMobi> yeah, never been big fan our wiki pages anyway
[12:01:03] <cgack> so... the whole review in a gh issue
[12:01:09] <arschmitz> i think issue is more likely to get attention then wiki to
[12:01:14] <uGoMobi> it's a bit of a mess so it's hard to find info there
[12:01:29] <arschmitz> ok so lets do issue
[12:01:32] <uGoMobi> +1 for attaching public Google doc
[12:01:38] <arschmitz> and we can update the description as we go
[12:01:54] <_|Nix|_> I don't get this attaching thing. You can attach stuff to issues?
[12:01:58] <_|Nix|_> ... other than images?
[12:02:01] <arschmitz> what does a google doc get us?
[12:02:29] <uGoMobi> errr
[12:02:42] <uGoMobi> I type what I was reading
[12:03:16] <arschmitz> :) ok so since we can put images and such in issues now and even nice little checkboxes
[12:03:21] <cgack> question: on an issue can we all edit without sub-comments vs a google doc we get a single source of collaborative edits right?
[12:03:25] <arschmitz> why dont we just keep it all in the issue
[12:03:49] <arschmitz> cgack: we can edit the description and you can if you open
[12:03:58] <arschmitz> others would need to leave comments
[12:04:07] <cgack> okay cool. just update based on feedback
[12:04:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how does that sound to you?
[12:05:34] <uGoMobi> yeah, sounds good to me
[12:05:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe ill come up with a template similar to what is in ui wiki
[12:06:07] <uGoMobi> I like the markdown checkbox too
[12:06:19] <uGoMobi> checkboxes*
[12:06:25] <arschmitz> and we can use the template for all widget stuff like this
[12:06:28] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, and it's server-backed. Very nice!
[12:06:30] <uGoMobi> to list the goals
[12:06:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you mean markdown that we can copy paste?
[12:07:00] <arschmitz> yes
[12:07:04] <uGoMobi> when opening an issue
[12:07:05] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:07:06] <arschmitz> and just fill in the blanks
[12:07:18] <arschmitz> like you might have seen the one im using for prs
[12:07:35] <arschmitz> and there is one in the ui wiki for those pages i showed that they use for planning any widget or feature
[12:08:16] <arschmitz> which i stole completely from tj_vantoll :)
[12:08:30] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:09:58] <arschmitz> so cgack just open an issue with something generic about navbar review
[12:10:09] <arschmitz> and ill update with template and you can fill in
[12:10:17] <uGoMobi> ok, can you guys take a look at the notes in the agenda and correct what is wrong
[12:10:30] <cgack> something to replace -> navbar refactor - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6337
[12:10:57] <uGoMobi> actually there are some navbar tickets that can probably be closed as duplicate once they are covered by the review ticket
[12:11:04] <arschmitz> cgack: you need to open it
[12:11:10] <arschmitz> or you wont be able to edit it
[12:11:17] <cgack> right. will do
[12:11:19] <uGoMobi> cgack: I'll close mine as duplicate
[12:11:23] <arschmitz> so we can link those and close them as dips
[12:11:28] <arschmitz> dups
[12:11:39] <uGoMobi> but that tickets shows that I prefer lists in tickets over wiki pages too :)
[12:11:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol
[12:12:06] <arschmitz> yeah github wikis suck because there are no email notifications
[12:12:23] <uGoMobi> true
[12:12:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: starting writing something to do email notifications on github wikis once but it never happened
[12:12:46] <uGoMobi> actually I closed the other tickets as duplicate already when I opened that ticket
[12:13:07] <cgack> navbar review issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7359
[12:13:22] <arschmitz> cgack: awesome ill make a template and update it
[12:13:50] <_|Nix|_> I can probably use that for the table review issue as well
[12:14:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that would be the idea
[12:14:17] <arschmitz> to use it for everything
[12:14:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: TBH, that UI link you mentioned is a bit intimidating. I'd much prefer a simple gh-issue-checklist, like we were saying.
[12:15:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its intentionally so those are all things we should be putting more thought into
[12:15:43] <arschmitz> i agree its a pain i have done 3 now lol
[12:15:44] <uGoMobi> we are running late
[12:15:46] <arschmitz> but its worth it
[12:15:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're turning into the W3C :)
[12:15:59] <uGoMobi> but nice to have an overview of what needs to be done for 1.5
[12:15:59] <arschmitz> we need to think more and test accessability
[12:16:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agreed
[12:16:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... which is not to say that's a bad thing :)
[12:16:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it wont be exactly the same but will likely have much of the same sections
[12:17:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for us i want to add a perf section though
[12:17:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, for sure!
[12:17:24] <arschmitz> as that is key for mobile
[12:17:40] <_|Nix|_> Perf makes or breaks it for us.
[12:18:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For table at least, I wanna keep the code completely equivalent as I flatten the widget, although I suspect I'll find some perf tweaks along the way.
[12:19:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dont forget about what we did in portland with krinkle
[12:19:05] <arschmitz> thats a huge needed change
[12:19:14] <uGoMobi> gseguin _|Nix|_ : can you guys give https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/207 a look as well when you have time
[12:19:30] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yes
[12:19:42] <uGoMobi> perfect, thanks
[12:19:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Please remind me?
[12:20:26] <arschmitz> batching row enhancment to be non blocking
[12:21:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that. That'd be idea, but it should be behind an option, because it has implication for page jankiness.
[12:21:43] <_|Nix|_> s/idea/ideal/
[12:21:55] <arschmitz> and based on a timer so its optimized to never block on any device
[12:22:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not really you detect page side and offset and always do the number that fit on screen first
[12:22:23] <arschmitz> and batch based on perf after
[12:22:32] <uGoMobi> Anything else, otherwise I suggest we wrap up here
[12:22:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: anyway thats why we need a place to discuss this :)
[12:22:53] <uGoMobi> We are still a bit behind with logging this meeting on http://meetings.jquery.org/category/mobile/
[12:23:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom is working on that
[12:23:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll add a checkbox for all that.
[12:24:28] <uGoMobi> ok, thanks all!
[12:24:35] <_|Nix|_> K L8R
[12:24:35] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[12:24:40] <uGoMobi> later
