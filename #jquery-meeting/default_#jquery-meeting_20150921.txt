[08:59:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, gibson042, arthurvr, m_gol meeting time!
[08:59:29] <timmywil> in 30 seconds
[08:59:34] <m_gol> present
[08:59:43] <DaveMethvin> here
[09:00:05] <timmywil> how's it goin
[09:00:23] <m_gol> the Safari 7.0 we got back from BrowserStack fails the createHTMLDocument test for some reason :/
[09:00:30] <m_gol> not sure what changed
[09:00:40] <m_gol> it's 7.0.6, the latest one, as we had before
[09:01:28] <timmywil> m_gol: ok, you wanna add that to the notes?
[09:01:33] <m_gol> sure
[09:01:44] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2558
[09:01:59] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: We talked about this last week, but want to confirm with you that we should close
[09:02:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think we just can't make enough of an improvement to warrant a lot of new possible bugs
[09:02:46] <timmywil> yea, that's where we fell
[09:03:29] <timmywil> Is anyone opposed to dropping this signature? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2491
[09:03:43] <DaveMethvin> no objection here
[09:03:43] <m_gol> I'm +1 to remove
[09:03:45] <timmywil> I've only used .toggleClass( class, boolean )
[09:04:05] <markelog> +1
[09:04:07] <timmywil> better to be specific
[09:04:20] <timmywil> cool
[09:05:17] <m_gol> not sure if we want to document it in the notes but Android 2.3 is still failing pretty bad http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1311
[09:05:29] <m_gol> maybe not loading all test modules at once will help (once I get to it)
[09:05:50] <timmywil> No harm in noting, but I'm not surprised.
[09:05:54] <markelog> did we discuss https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2558 ?
[09:06:03] <timmywil> yea
[09:06:08] <timmywil> going to close
[09:06:17] <markelog> DaveMethvin: i wrote on mozilla ticket
[09:06:27] <markelog> Ollie said he is gonna fix it soon
[09:06:33] <DaveMethvin> YAY!
[09:06:35] <timmywil> nice, thanks markelog
[09:06:36] <markelog> we have same issue in Chrome right?
[09:06:43] <timmywil> we can note that in the ticket
[09:06:43] <DaveMethvin> yep as i recall
[09:06:53] <DaveMethvin> once we get one to fix it should help
[09:06:57] <markelog> do we have a ticket ref in their tracker?
[09:07:02] <DaveMethvin> altho i haven't checked on Edge
[09:07:13] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if there is a chrome ticket
[09:07:34] <markelog> in the thread it seems that you discuss this with someone from chrome team?
[09:08:06] <markelog> i guess we can draw attention to it through our contacts?
[09:08:20] <markelog> DaveMethvin: do you have anyone in mind?
[09:08:42] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish maybe? he's here in the channel
[09:09:06] <DaveMethvin> i think i looked for a ticket, found one in firefox but not chrome
[09:09:26] <markelog> i will search, if not gonna find it, will create one
[09:09:40] <markelog> will also write a letter to paul if he is busy right now
[09:10:45] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2432
[09:11:30] <timmywil> So, I'm in favor of disabling script execution by default for cross domain scripts.
[09:11:57] <DaveMethvin> well it's a 3.0 so i suppose we can warn people
[09:12:08] <timmywil> it doesn't have to be 3.0
[09:12:21] <timmywil> but I'd like it
[09:12:37] <timmywil> where does everyone stand? +/-1
[09:12:42] <DaveMethvin> it could be 4.0 perhaps but it is a breaking change so it should be a major version
[09:12:42] <markelog> it seems to be in parity with cross origin policy
[09:13:01] <m_gol> I'm +1 in 3.0
[09:13:04] <m_gol> we already have a PR
[09:13:07] <DaveMethvin> and it seems pretty simple to implement so 3.0 would be a good time
[09:13:14] <timmywil> +1
[09:13:16] <m_gol> and since we're improving security in 3.0, this seems like a good fit
[09:13:17] <markelog> but i never face that issue myself or heard anyone else to see that issue
[09:13:21] <markelog> so i'm +0
[09:13:42] <DaveMethvin> i think it's more theater than substance but it won't hurt for people to say they want a script
[09:14:14] <DaveMethvin> if you're requesting something from a remote domain you've already given up a lot of control to it
[09:14:15] <m_gol> as for 3.0 etc.
[09:14:49] <markelog> okay, will land this then
[09:15:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: agreed, but I still think it's an improvement to force the user to be explicit about execution
[09:15:00] <m_gol> I've changed some milestones, I pushed some tickets to 3.0.1 or 3.1.0. I might have made some mistakes so please review the milestones
[09:15:15] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: yes those looked good
[09:15:26] <m_gol> it'd be even greater if you looked at 3.0.0 tickets assigned to you and think if sth from the list may be moved
[09:15:33] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:15:50] <m_gol> we still have 28 tickets open against 3.0.0
[09:15:56] <m_gol> it was about 43 so we have progress ;-P
[09:16:15] <timmywil> 15 tickets down!
[09:16:16] <m_gol> but we need to cut corners IMO; the most important issues are ones that will cause a breaking change
[09:16:37] <m_gol> they should go into 3.0.0 unless they require a lot of work that's not done yet; the rest can be pushed
[09:16:38] <timmywil> lol, what is happening to the bullets
[09:16:52] <m_gol> haha
[09:16:56] <DaveMethvin> sharp bullets there
[09:17:06] <timmywil> someone gave it class
[09:17:15] <m_gol> backspace to the previous line & press enter, it'll fix itself
[09:17:16] <gibson042> I'll do https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1761 and release Sizzle this week
[09:17:32] <gibson042> which will also clear out one or two more IIRC
[09:17:46] <m_gol> and we'll stop seeing Edge failures when we get it into Core :)
[09:17:55] <timmywil> nice
[09:18:15] <m_gol> we have one Chrome 45 failure, it seems it lost some precision...
[09:18:29] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2577
[09:18:43] <timmywil> I'm ok with a commit hook
[09:18:56] <m_gol> it would be quite long, though
[09:19:19] <m_gol> I sometimes commit, then amend with some changes, I'd be blocked for a few seconds during the commit
[09:19:19] <timmywil> that brings up a question. what exactly are we checking?
[09:19:32] <timmywil> just linting?
[09:19:35] <m_gol> I like quick git hooks, like commitplease
[09:19:38] <markelog> jscs & jshint
[09:19:38] <markelog> yeah
[09:19:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's either a great idea or SUPER annoying
[09:19:46] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:19:54] <markelog> DaveMethvin: true that!
[09:19:54] <timmywil> and just linting src?
[09:20:02] <timmywil> or would it need to build every time
[09:20:05] <markelog> basically `grunt lint`
[09:20:12] <DaveMethvin> ideally it would just lint the changed files?
[09:20:19] <markelog> would be cool!
[09:20:34] <markelog> yeah, in my work projects we do exactly that
[09:20:50] <timmywil> well, grunt lint lints the dist
[09:20:56] <gibson042> meh, it seems like too much too soon... better to keep it in grunt IMO
[09:20:57] <m_gol> `grunt lint` takes 13.3s on my machine
[09:20:57] <timmywil> I'd rather it just check src
[09:21:14] <m_gol> I think it's too long for a commit hook
[09:21:17] <markelog> i'd say changed files is way to go
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah it needs to take a second or two, otherwise it's just annoying
[09:21:25] <markelog> moving that to the grunt command
[09:21:32] <markelog> and executing it as such
[09:21:38] <m_gol> we'd also need to load tasks differently
[09:21:45] <timmywil> yea, changed files only could work
[09:21:50] <m_gol> via a hack like jit-grunt instead of official APIs
[09:22:15] <m_gol> otherwise Grunt loads all tasks regardless of they being called, this adds a few seconds
[09:22:18] <timmywil> markelog: ok, I think the next step is to review some code
[09:22:21] <DaveMethvin> could we have a different gruntfile if we really want grunt to do this?
[09:22:27] <markelog> okay, on me then
[09:22:45] <markelog> i'd say we need to see how actually long that would be
[09:22:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:22:56] <timmywil> yea, one step at a time
[09:23:00] <markelog> simple require is pretty fast
[09:23:05] <markelog> right
[09:23:31] <timmywil> as far as PRs, I only have a question on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2582
[09:23:35] <m_gol> Grunt isn't fast, unfortunately :-)
[09:24:21] <m_gol> timmywil gibson042: I like this idea but I think we should go further and *always* load only the requested module & replace others with dummy ones
[09:24:43] <m_gol> that's the idea that *might* make Android 2.3 not time out on 80% of test modules
[09:24:58] <timmywil> m_gol: we could make that the next stage
[09:24:59] <m_gol> (this can land in a separate PR, I don't care too much)
[09:25:02] <m_gol> yup
[09:25:06] <timmywil> cool
[09:25:19] <m_gol> you had one question :)
[09:25:19] <timmywil> gibson042: did you happen to check amd mode?
[09:25:29] <gibson042> no; I didn't think to
[09:25:40] <timmywil> ok, just want to make sure this doesn't break that
[09:26:07] <timmywil> I doubt it does
[09:26:14] <timmywil> but wonky things happen in amd mode
[09:26:58] <timmywil> that's all I had
[09:27:02] <timmywil> anything else?
[09:27:07] <gibson042> I just checked; it seems to be good
[09:27:13] <markelog> what about blog post and communicating with edge team?
[09:27:13] <timmywil> cool
[09:27:18] <timmywil> gibson042: I think it's good to land then
[09:27:26] <gibson042> will do
[09:27:32] <timmywil> markelog: that's on me
[09:27:40] <markelog> any progress?
[09:27:50] <markelog> not pushing, just wondering )
[09:27:53] <timmywil> not yet
[09:27:58] <markelog> ok-ok
[09:28:01] <timmywil> will try to get to both this week
[09:28:06] <markelog> btw, talked with Krinkle
[09:28:12] <markelog> about gitter
[09:28:17] <markelog> it seems pretty easy
[09:28:20] <timmywil> oh, also, I guess I should mention. I'm talking about jQuery 3.0 on web platform podcast tomorrow.
[09:28:31] <markelog> but no one knows exactly how to port those logs
[09:28:45] <markelog> timmywil: cool!
[09:28:51] <markelog> what podcast?
[09:29:05] <timmywil> that's it's name, web platform podcast
[09:29:10] <markelog> :-))
[09:29:27] <timmywil> should be fun
[09:29:33] <m_gol> good luck :)
[09:29:40] <DaveMethvin> http://thewebplatform.libsyn.com/ ?
[09:29:47] <DaveMethvin> yay timmywil
[09:29:50] <markelog> anyhow, i guess we can try gitter
[09:29:50] <markelog> now
[09:30:05] <markelog> will verify everything is cool with logs this week
[09:30:27] <timmywil> the google plus event: https://plus.google.com/events/chsvt3dv4vr69krtikcu5793e6g
[09:30:31] <m_gol> when do we want the next alpha/beta?
[09:30:45] <m_gol> should we start marking some bugs as blockers for this next pre-release?
[09:31:02] <timmywil> markelog: cool
[09:32:47] <timmywil> m_gol: not sure when would be a good time, but I plan on getting a lot of tickets done when the summit gets closer. Then I think we'll be a better spot to release.
[09:32:49] <markelog> m_gol: i'd say whenever it happens, it would be preferable to happen after the blog post
[09:32:54] <m_gol> k
[09:33:05] <m_gol> I've looked at this Safari 7.0
[09:33:16] <m_gol> and it has a different user agent than it used to before removal :O
[09:33:23] <timmywil> O.o
[09:33:24] <m_gol> in particular, it shows a newer WebKit version
[09:33:31] <m_gol> even though they're both 7.0.6
[09:33:46] <m_gol> that would explain why it fails the createHTMLDocument support test if it has some code from Safari 8.0...
[09:33:52] <m_gol> I'll write to BrowserStack, this seems worrying
[09:34:01] <timmywil> thanks m_gol
[09:34:09] <timmywil> alright, see you all in -dev
[09:34:14] <markelog> see ya
