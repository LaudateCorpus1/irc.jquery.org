[09:02:17] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron gnarf jaubourg m_gol orkel gibson042  it's meeting time!
[09:02:28] <timmywil> sup
[09:02:49] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:03:31] <DaveMethvin> so howya doin, you just lazin' out this summer and riding your bike around?
[09:03:51] <timmywil> that would be nice
[09:04:12] <timmywil> lotsa work, little time
[09:04:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too, i thought it would be relaxing
[09:04:38] <DaveMethvin> i've been traveling a lot for work
[09:04:58] <DaveMethvin> but that's cool, i don't think we have a lot of high-prio jquery core stuff
[09:05:11] <timmywil> just amd
[09:05:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm excited about thiat
[09:05:23] <DaveMethvin> that
[09:05:28] <DaveMethvin> looks like it's just us?
[09:05:40] <_orkel> hey guys
[09:05:45] <DaveMethvin> hey _orkel
[09:06:08] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil should we look at the AMD fork now, or do you have more you want to do?
[09:06:29] <timmywil> in terms of splitting stuff up into modules, I think the branch is in a good place
[09:06:38] <timmywil> but the build is broken right now
[09:06:44] <timmywil> that's my next step
[09:07:04] <DaveMethvin> ah, you mean like stripping the headers and puttting it back together into a single lump?
[09:07:14] <timmywil> right, the CDN build
[09:07:15] <DaveMethvin> and custom builds i guess
[09:07:37] <timmywil> custom builds will get a bump
[09:07:53] <timmywil> I mean, more modules to exclude
[09:08:13] <DaveMethvin> which is fine
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> better granularity
[09:08:21] <DaveMethvin> smaller builds
[09:08:28] <timmywil> and if you remove a module, dependencies for that modules will also get removed
[09:08:37] <timmywil> for instance, removing sizzle removes the animate selector
[09:08:46] <DaveMethvin> oh nice
[09:09:09] <timmywil> ready has been separated into its own module
[09:09:14] <DaveMethvin> which is good
[09:09:26] <timmywil> so that can be excluded as well
[09:09:30] <timmywil> etc etc
[09:10:00] <timmywil> I've got everything organized and I know how it will be done (mostly). Just gotta get the build working.
[09:10:10] <DaveMethvin> i'll definitely take a look
[09:10:23] <timmywil> Most tests that don't require iframes (because they include built files) are working
[09:10:41] <timmywil> I'll also add a QUnit option to include built/min/AMD
[09:11:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah we'll need that
[09:11:20] <timmywil> the default should still be min yea?
[09:11:29] <DaveMethvin> i think so
[09:11:37] <timmywil> cool
[09:11:53] <DaveMethvin> we can add some other jenkins tests if we want
[09:12:07] <DaveMethvin> maybe just a sanity check with a subset of browsers using AMD
[09:12:45] <timmywil> also, in terms of publishing to NPM and bower, I was thinking we have the CDN files along with the src folder (for including certain modules)
[09:13:20] <DaveMethvin> seems like they want the built versions, yeah
[09:13:44] <timmywil> we can revisit that later too
[09:13:51] <DaveMethvin> for those situations it's much more handy to have the built version than to make people install and rebuild themselves
[09:14:07] <DaveMethvin> _orkel did you talk to Krinkle about the browsers in testswarm?
[09:14:19] <timmywil> right, but there are some questions like do people need custom builds in NPM
[09:14:39] <DaveMethvin> timmywil it should be possible, yah?
[09:14:49] <_orkel> mm, only after the last meeting
[09:14:59] <_orkel> i will ping him
[09:15:15] <DaveMethvin> thanks _orkel
[09:15:46] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: probably, yea, which means the NPM package would contain the gruntfile and node modules required for building
[09:16:07] <DaveMethvin> i'm not too worried about custom builds in npm right now if it's a pain, we could start without them and see what people want
[09:16:31] <timmywil> most use cases will be covered by including built files
[09:16:42] <DaveMethvin> and the file size isn't a big issue there
[09:16:58] <DaveMethvin> so removing offset/effects etc aren't a big concern
[09:17:11] <timmywil> right, that's the counter argument
[09:17:54] <DaveMethvin> i could see someone perhaps wanting them gone to be sure they weren't being called in the code they were testing
[09:18:07] <DaveMethvin> but again we can worry about that when someone asks for it :)
[09:18:27] <timmywil> I mean, it
[09:18:30] <timmywil> woops
[09:18:37] <timmywil> it's not hard to include the necessary files for building
[09:19:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's mainly a question of whether someone wanted to hassle with building their own
[09:19:15] <DaveMethvin> maybe node guys would, i dunno
[09:19:37] <timmywil> maybe, seems to me they use the src folder
[09:20:03] <timmywil> but, anyway, we can cross that bridge later
[09:20:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:20:17] <DaveMethvin> or just blow up the bridge and make people swim
[09:20:28] <timmywil> hehe
[09:20:36] <DaveMethvin> so that's about it for me, anybody else have anything?
[09:20:44] <DaveMethvin> ticket triage looks pretty clean right now
[09:20:52] <DaveMethvin> a couple of things lying around
[09:21:19] <DaveMethvin> otherwise, we're done!
[09:22:04] <DaveMethvin> _orkel i am learning russian for my trip this october
[09:22:11] <DaveMethvin> you guys have a HARD language
[09:22:15] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:22:44] <_orkel> some people say it's is harder than Chinese :-)
[09:22:45] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: for the forced layouts thing, I think AMD will help with that (lazily load shared support tests)
[09:23:15] <DaveMethvin> timmywil agreed, the lazy support tests definitely help
[09:23:25] <_orkel> but it's not harder than dealing with focus bugs i suppose :-)
[09:23:42] <timmywil> ha
[09:23:43] <DaveMethvin> i think i can get by if i don't have to conjugate my verbs
[09:24:04] <DaveMethvin> alright guys
[09:24:04] <timmywil> I can say vodka
[09:24:19] <DaveMethvin> thanks for coming, see you in -dev
[09:24:25] <timmywil> peace
[09:24:25] <_orkel> see ya!
