[09:06:02] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from rwaldron: I just asked Rose (@rosiecheeks617) to marry me, she said yes. :D http://t.co/V6iSSsJF ★ http://bit.ly/QfqETB
[09:06:13] <DaveMethvin> oh awesome!
[09:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Do you see the irony in me informing DaveMethvin of this via a tweet? :-P
[09:07:25] <DaveMethvin> i looked thru his recent tweets right after seeing that but didn't find that one
[09:08:03] <DaveMethvin> okay, well looks like it will be a quiet meeting
[09:08:09] <gnarf> im here too
[09:08:22] <gnarf> when come jquery 1.8?
[09:08:29] <gnarf> :)
[09:08:33] <DaveMethvin> well the notes say Thursday
[09:08:40] <DaveMethvin> wanted to wait for timmywil to get back
[09:08:46] <DaveMethvin> so we could give him all the impossible bugs
[09:08:48] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:08:54] <timmywil> oh I'm back today btw ;)
[09:09:01] <DaveMethvin> welcome back!
[09:09:09] <DaveMethvin> couldn't stand another day away i guess
[09:09:24] <timmywil> thanks!
[09:09:30] <DaveMethvin> we missed you
[09:09:33] <timmywil> I missed your poetry
[09:09:48] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 held down the fort quite well
[09:09:55] <timmywil> I knew he would
[09:10:12] <timmywil> even though I'm changing a couple little things ;)
[09:10:20] <DaveMethvin> i figured you would :)
[09:10:22] <gibson042> I knew you would ;)
[09:10:25] <DaveMethvin> thats why i wanted to wait
[09:10:27] <gnarf> i'm currently playing around with a different queue strategy for testswarm-browserstack :)
[09:10:43] <gnarf> and I've probably messed up everybodies deploy process
[09:10:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that is the one thing i REALLY want to do before rc1
[09:10:48] <gnarf> just fyi
[09:10:54] <DaveMethvin> GET TESTING TO WORK IN BS
[09:11:42] <timmywil> gibson042: <3 you for separating sizzle test suite
[09:11:45] <DaveMethvin> i think we needed a change to the host iframe to change its CSS so that IE8 bug goes away
[09:12:04] <timmywil> test html*
[09:12:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah, trying to integrate sizzle html changes was a minefield before
[09:13:17] <DaveMethvin> so i'd like to keep our changes conservative at this point, only landing important stuff
[09:13:49] <DaveMethvin> i think we're in  pretty good shape bug-wise
[09:14:20] <DaveMethvin> gnarf have you looked through the bug list for effects? There are quite a few tix but i dunno if they are still there with the rewrite
[09:14:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i think mikesherov had done that a bit
[09:14:42] <gnarf> i will try to review again this week
[09:14:54] <DaveMethvin> ok i saw mike closed a few too
[09:16:02] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: when was the UI update coming out?
[09:17:47] <timmywil> anything high priority for me for rc?
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> I can do it today or tomorrow.
[09:18:25] <DaveMethvin> thanks scott_gonzalez
[09:18:31] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i don't think so
[09:18:35] <timmywil> cool
[09:18:46] <timmywil> I don't see anything assigned to me, just checkin
[09:19:23] <DaveMethvin> if you've got some time maybe you could look at the open effects bugs timmywil?
[09:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: A ticket came in this morning about :focus. I only glanced at it, but it looked like it's probably bogus.
[09:20:04] <timmywil> yea, I'll continue triaging
[09:20:28] <DaveMethvin> I hate anything related to focus!!!
[09:20:52] <timmywil> I admit I don't understand effects as much as others right now. Need to dig into that code.
[09:21:12] <DaveMethvin> well mainly i was wondering if all the open tix were still valid with the rewrite
[09:21:26] <timmywil> ah, gotcha
[09:21:31] <timmywil> easy enough
[09:21:42] <DaveMethvin> any other issues to be discussed?
[09:21:50] <DaveMethvin> or should we call it a meeting?
[09:22:08] <DaveMethvin> we should run out before mikesherov comes in :P
[09:22:25] <DaveMethvin> okay, see ya in -dev then!
