[09:00:22] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:00:50] <snover> estoy aquí
[09:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have much to talk about today.
[09:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> Probably don't even really need a meeting today.
[09:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> I've been making progress on the release script.
[09:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a PR for jquery-release to add support for GitHub issues in the changelog: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/8
[09:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> And here's my WIP for the actual release script: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pep/tree/release-script
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't have too much time to spend on that this past week though.
[09:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> I should have it done before the next meeting.
[09:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like we'll go with pepjs for the npm and bower package name.
[09:03:38] <snover> that release script is super intense :)
[09:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's the goal of jquery-release :-)
[09:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's all I have for this week.
[09:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:05:39] <arschmitz> nope
[09:05:45] <snover> ok, sounds good. i probably won’t be here next week since i am trying to take an enforced vacation from everything :)
[09:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> Enjoy your vacation. I just took a short one :-)
[09:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why I didn't have much time to work on the release script...
[09:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in #pep.
[09:07:45] <snover> thanks!

[11:01:40] <b-ot> arschmitz: agcolom, arschmitz, arthurvr, cgack, gabriel_schulhof, ianmaffett, jasperdegroot, sfrisk
[11:01:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Yo!
[11:01:51] <arthurvr> hey
[11:01:53] <sfrisk> I have been beckoned!
[11:01:53] <cgack> howdy
[11:02:23] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:04:18] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=1505332384
[11:05:51] <arschmitz> lets as start with classes
[11:06:21] <arschmitz> any updates from cgack or gabriel_schulhof here?
[11:06:43] <gabriel_schulhof> I just opened a PR for popup classes.
[11:06:54] <gabriel_schulhof> The arrow made for an interesting diversion.
[11:07:07] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because it applies classes in response to the shadow option.
[11:07:22] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so the usual widget backcompat was insufficient.
[11:07:47] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and in the process of extending the backcompat with a popup arrow-specific version, I found some bugs with it.
[11:08:01] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but the fix for those has now landed in ui-1-12.
[11:08:34] <cgack> other than {{dayjob}} being busy, nothing.
[11:08:34] <cgack> but.... I should have toolbar finished up soonish and then moving forward with the remainder should be smoother
[11:09:01] <arschmitz> execlent
[11:09:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: any update on icons?
[11:09:46] <jasperdegroot> no update, slow progress. sorry
[11:12:35] <arschmitz> ok
[11:12:44] <arschmitz> did you get your question about icon only addressed?
[11:12:55] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i never heard from you about it
[11:13:36] <jasperdegroot> no, not yet
[11:14:03] <arschmitz> ok in ui there is a special class on the button for icon only
[11:14:16] <jasperdegroot> we have to decide if we keep supporting text inside the button or only inside the icon span
[11:14:17] <arschmitz> that does text-indent and positions the icon absolute
[11:14:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no just look at how i do it in ui
[11:14:52] <jasperdegroot> ok, we could use position absolute there
[11:15:01] <jasperdegroot> it's only a problem if we use inline-block
[11:15:32] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/blob/button-fixup/themes/base/button.css#L50
[11:15:54] <jasperdegroot> yeah, that's how we used to do it also
[11:15:59] <arschmitz> yes
[11:16:03] <arschmitz> so thats basicly not changing
[11:16:19] <jasperdegroot> the problem only showed up because I was switching everything to inline-block
[11:16:26] <arschmitz> also its like the only thing left in button.css other then the .ui-button rule lol
[11:16:34] <jasperdegroot> maybe i missed that icon only class
[11:16:56] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah right now that basicly keys everything
[11:17:01] <jasperdegroot> i thought all icon position classes would be removed
[11:17:12] <arschmitz> they are i dont consider that a postion
[11:17:17] <arschmitz> its a different button type
[11:17:28] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:17:45] <arschmitz> thats how the widget is too its an option by it self not a postion
[11:17:45] <jasperdegroot> problem solved then, I will revert that change
[11:17:58] <jasperdegroot> and try to open PR asap
[11:18:03] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesome
[11:18:06] <jasperdegroot> ok clear
[11:18:51] <arschmitz> sfrisk: any progress on accordion?
[11:19:04] <sfrisk> nope sorry, it's a priority for this weekend
[11:19:11] <arschmitz> sfrisk: ok thank you
[11:19:14] <sfrisk> providing work doesn't dump me with a bunch of stuff this weekend too
[11:19:30] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:19:41] <arschmitz> ok so the next 3 topics all go together it turned out
[11:20:01] <arschmitz> qunit-assert-classes, umd-wrapper, and esformatter
[11:20:10] <arschmitz> and qunit upgrade four topics lol
[11:21:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Did you have a chance to run esformatter on the new boilerplate?
[11:21:47] <arschmitz> right now im rebaseing that branch with an updated ui-1-12
[11:21:49] <arschmitz> and running it
[11:22:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... I should rebase my PR too ...
[11:22:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no
[11:22:27] <arschmitz> ill take care of it
[11:22:55] <arschmitz> unless there is something wrong with the pr im just going to push an updated ui-1-12 with wrapper/ ui update
[11:23:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[11:23:28] <arschmitz> so on that we tried to update qunit-assert-classes
[11:23:40] <arschmitz> but it requires qunit 1.16 and we were on 1.14
[11:24:21] <arschmitz> and the wrapper updated needed the qunit to pass and esformatter didnt like our current wrapper so i need new wrapper to do esformatter updates
[11:25:04] <gabriel_schulhof> </juggle>
[11:25:56] <arschmitz> but qunit and qunit-assert-classes are updated
[11:27:27] <arschmitz> the qunit upgrade is thanks to a GSoC person we have had a few good pr's from him and one other
[11:27:32] <arschmitz> so thats awesome
[11:27:56] <arschmitz> and we have several people planning on submitting for the switch to intern and for prototyping the transition module
[11:28:21] <arschmitz> dont think they are here they are in india so its like middle of the night there
[11:28:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[11:29:10] <arschmitz> i think our last think to discuss is the websites
[11:29:36] <arschmitz> http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Websites/
[11:30:12] <jasperdegroot> that are a lot of red dots :(
[11:30:27] <arschmitz> yup
[11:30:31] <jasperdegroot> and dark clouds
[11:31:31] <arschmitz> this is good busy work if anyone finds them selves looking for something like that
[11:31:48] <arschmitz> its a lot of switching http->https and adding trailing slashes
[11:32:21] <arschmitz> jquerymobile.com is hard because it contains the changelogs
[11:32:32] <arschmitz> incredible amount of links in those
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> that job runs and updates every night for each site
[11:34:19] <arschmitz> i think thats all i have for this week
[11:34:28] <arschmitz> any one have anything else?
[11:35:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Not I.
[11:35:21] <cgack> nope
[11:35:48] <sfrisk> nope
[11:36:01] <arschmitz> oh there is something
[11:36:03] <arschmitz> wait wait
[11:36:17] <arschmitz> 2 things even
[11:36:24] <jasperdegroot> ohh
[11:37:22] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sfrisk https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8037
[11:37:51] <jasperdegroot> yeah, I was just looking at that
[11:38:04] <sfrisk> That popped up in my email today
[11:38:08] <sfrisk> will look into it
[11:38:11] <jasperdegroot> want to look into the issue before commenting on the PR
[11:38:31] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8002
[11:38:35] <arschmitz> is the other
[11:38:45] <jasperdegroot> and also check with the changes that we are gonna make for 1.5
[11:40:03] <arschmitz> ok
[11:40:12] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: your suggested fix for 8002 sounds good, but have to give it a closer look
[11:46:13] <arschmitz> ok
[11:48:25] <arschmitz> ok if thats it ill see everyone back on -dev
