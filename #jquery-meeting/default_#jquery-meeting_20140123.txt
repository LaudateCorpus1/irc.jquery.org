[07:57:00] <rxaviers> Krinkle|detached
[07:57:26] <rxaviers> hey santhosh_,
[07:57:37] <santhosh_> rxaviers: hello
[07:58:19] <rxaviers> let's give some mins and see if someone else is joining
[08:00:19] <santhosh_> rxaviers: it was busy days for me after our last meeting. I must apologize- I did not get a chance to relook at the document we prepared
[08:00:59] <rxaviers> santhosh_, ok, thanks for letting me know
[08:01:02] <rxaviers> Krinkle, siebrand, Hi
[08:01:10] <siebrand> Good day!
[08:01:40] <rxaviers> Good day (I guess afternoon/night for you right)
[08:02:07] <siebrand> Krinkle, santhosh, Nikerabbit and I are in San Francisco. 08:00 here.
[08:02:21] <rxaviers> ah! Right, for the event
[08:02:29] <rxaviers> Nikerabbit, santhosh_, Krinkle, siebrand, do you have any updates? Would someone like to start?
[08:04:26] <siebrand> https://docs.google.com/a/wikimedia.org/document/d/1zARV2WMowVU38MOOyYI120ceQ7KY6z-1lh_3kFIcLcc/edit is the doc we were working on.
[08:07:33] <rxaviers> ok...
[08:08:24] <Nikerabbit> morning
[08:08:41] <Krinkle> Hi Nikerabbit
[08:08:49] <rxaviers> Hello Nikerabbit
[08:10:18] <rxaviers> siebrand, anything else?
[08:10:27] <siebrand> Not from me.
[08:10:32] <rxaviers> Ok
[08:10:58] <rxaviers> Krinkle, Nikerabbit, do you guys have any updates?
[08:11:46] <Nikerabbit> Currently having other priorities, so not many changes in our libraries.
[08:12:07] <Nikerabbit> if I remember correctly santhosh_ added fallback handling to jquery.i18n
[08:13:07] <rxaviers> Ok thanks
[08:13:11] <rxaviers> The document lists the components of a Localization/I18n architecture. I have added comments on the components jQuery Globalize offers a solution.
[08:14:57] <Nikerabbit> there are lots of comments in the doc, should we discuss them to get any unclear things resolved?
[08:16:16] <rxaviers> I think the overall is clear enough now. We could discuss specifics after the meeting
[08:17:21] <rxaviers> I think a good next action item for us is to identify an initial work we could collaborate.
[08:17:45] <rxaviers> In my last email to you, I have send my proposal. I would like to hear what you think or if you think we should collaborate on somewhere else.
[08:18:15] <rxaviers> Once we have something there, we could schedule our next meeting, or it gets kinda pointless I think.
[08:18:19] <rxaviers> What do you guys think?
[08:19:51] <Nikerabbit> with the proposal do you specifically refer to the relative time format for globalize?
[08:20:29] <rxaviers> correct. That's one place I see we both need.
[08:21:17] <Nikerabbit> seems reasonable
[08:22:01] <rxaviers> Excellent.
[08:22:37] <rxaviers> I think we could draft an API and start something...
[08:23:27] <rxaviers> perhaps by creating a new document like the architecture one, or perhaps just beginning implementing something, creating a PR and discuss on github.
[08:24:20] <Nikerabbit> we are planning to use the cldr data for that too, right?
[08:24:27] <rxaviers> correct
[08:24:34] <Nikerabbit> Krinkle: are you aware of any specific requirements with relative dates?
[08:25:27] <siebrand> (brb, ~15 mins)
[08:25:35] <rxaviers> Ok siebrand
[08:25:43] <rxaviers> I guess we're pretty much done for the meeting.
[08:26:03] <rxaviers> We could continue the relative date talk somewhere else.
[08:26:13] <rxaviers> Sorry to interrupt on that Nikerabbit.
[08:26:20] <rxaviers> But, does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[08:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Did you want to discuss custom Date object?
[08:27:02] <rxaviers> It would be good to have iskren on board
[08:27:27] <rxaviers> But, it's certainly good to have more thoughts about it.
[08:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, didn't realize he wasn't here right now. I just got off a call with jzaefferer.
[08:28:06] <rxaviers> It was very well remembered though
[08:28:44] <rxaviers> Nikerabbit, santhosh_, siebrand, Krinkle, do you in wikipedia use anything to deal with Olson timezone on dates?
[08:29:19] <Nikerabbit> I do not know what is Olson
[08:29:30] <rxaviers> http://www.iana.org/time-zones
[08:29:51] <rxaviers> Im not sure if you have to in your application...
[08:30:00] <rxaviers> Just wondering...
[08:31:25] <rxaviers> I've exchanged some emails with iskren about it. On moment.js, they have a good piece of work on that regard, it's moment-timezone.
[08:32:46] <rxaviers> So, Nikerabbit, Krinkle, and who else is interested, we can continue the relative dates discussion on jqueryui-dev channel, or in some other place if you will.
[08:33:05] <Nikerabbit> rxaviers: only place is use preferences I think, where you can select the timezone times appear in
[08:33:14] <siebrand> (back)
[08:35:09] <rxaviers> Nikerabbit, do you handle timezone on clientside?
[08:35:28] <rxaviers> well, to be more specific
[08:35:41] <rxaviers> we currently have this issue formatting/parsing date timezones:
[08:35:49] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/202
[08:36:20] <rxaviers> So, feedbacks/suggestions are welcome
[08:37:24] <rxaviers> Anything else?
[08:37:37] <Nikerabbit> rxaviers: hmm I'm pretty sure our Flow project will need to handle those client side
[08:37:42] <Nikerabbit> but so far it is mostly server side
[08:37:50] <rxaviers> That's good to know.
[08:38:16] <rxaviers> I would like to hear thoughts on that regard.
[08:38:50] <rxaviers> Please, feel free to invite who you think is interested on it.
[08:39:08] <rxaviers> :)
[08:39:47] <rxaviers> Let's keep our next meeting for Feb 6 then (since we have an action item - relative dates)?
[08:39:59] <rxaviers> same time, same channel
[08:41:06] <rxaviers> In the meantime, we can also evolve the architecture document and bring anything up if we have something new.
[08:42:09] <rxaviers> Zzz
[08:42:15] <Nikerabbit> oki
[08:42:18] <rxaviers> :D
[08:42:25] <rxaviers> Is it jatlag folks?? :p
[08:42:36] <rxaviers> jet*
[08:43:03] <rxaviers> So, see you all next meeting
[08:43:10] <Nikerabbit> not exactly, there's just huge mess going on
[08:43:10] <rxaviers> Thanks for you time
[08:43:12] <Nikerabbit> np
[08:43:32] <rxaviers> I see
[11:01:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ agcolom gseguin
[11:02:43] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:03:18] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:03:28] <gseguin> I'm here
[11:03:38] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:03:40] <dam__> Afternoon all
[11:03:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz agcolom
[11:03:52] <uGoMobi> hey dam__
[11:03:58] <agcolom> Hey dam__ :-)
[11:04:02] <dam__> missed you guys :)
[11:04:05] <arschmitz> here
[11:04:21] <dam__> %s/guys/people/gi
[11:04:23] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc#gid=4
[11:04:28] <gseguin> hey dam__!
[11:04:44] <gseguin> will you be in San Diego?
[11:04:50] <dam__> I will!
[11:04:57] <gseguin> awesome!
[11:04:58] <uGoMobi> great!
[11:05:04] <dam__> can't wait to hack with you all in person again :)
[11:05:08] <uGoMobi> on the beach or at the conference?
[11:05:15] <gseguin> heh :)
[11:05:16] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:05:42] <dam__> BOTH!
[11:05:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: mind if i start real super quick?
[11:05:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: dam is Kristofer from Topcoat
[11:06:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure go ahead
[11:06:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Gotcha!
[11:06:11] <_|Nix|_> dam__: Hey!
[11:06:22] <arschmitz> i just basicly wanted to introduce dam__ to anyone that does not know who he is
[11:06:40] <arschmitz> as uGoMobi just said he is from topcoat hes the main guy on that project
[11:07:05] <arschmitz> and he expressed intrest on working with the foundation and the mobile project a few weeks ago
[11:07:19] <arschmitz> so hes going to be joining the meetings and starting to work with us
[11:07:30] <dam__> Very happy to be of service
[11:07:36] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:07:43] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:07:48] <gseguin> yay! happy to have you join the effort
[11:07:55] <arschmitz> he has a lot of awesomne experience with framework development and js and css in general
[11:08:09] <dam__> you are too kind
[11:08:15] <arschmitz> so hopefully he can help out a lot :)
[11:08:45] <dam__> Will definitely do my best
[11:09:03] <arschmitz> you also win us back a timezone we lost lol
[11:09:18] <arschmitz> didnt have anyone on west coast on mobile any more
[11:09:38] <gseguin> hey I'm considered west still
[11:09:47] <arschmitz> thought you were mountain time?
[11:09:50] <gseguin> the midwest starts at highway 25
[11:09:54] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Baby west :)
[11:09:55] <dam__> yes, I failed at converting the time zone last week
[11:10:12] <gseguin> oh yeah timezone wise I'm mountain
[11:10:16] <dam__> learned how to add now, so we are all good ;)
[11:10:42] <uGoMobi> ok what do we have for today
[11:11:02] <gseguin> I had a chat with a codeclimate guy
[11:11:37] <dam__> oooh
[11:11:49] <gseguin> it seems like they would be interested to work with the foundation but I'm not sure under which terms
[11:11:50] <uGoMobi> ok we can start at the bottom of the agenda :)
[11:12:12] <arschmitz> gseguin: we would have to talk to other projects too
[11:12:13] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok that's cool
[11:12:14] <gseguin> The last numbers I got from codeclimeate are actually not bad
[11:12:26] <arschmitz> last time this came up in dev leads it was decided we didnt want it
[11:12:27] <gseguin> now that I excluded external code and tests
[11:12:34] <gseguin> 2.42 GPA
[11:12:38] <uGoMobi> we were a bit worried about misinterpretation
[11:12:44] <gseguin> I sent an invite to arschmitz
[11:12:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i got it iv been checking it out
[11:12:58] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I understand
[11:13:20] <gseguin> that's what I told Mike (from code climate)
[11:13:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: i was suprised that once you excluded tests and other stuff it was not too bad
[11:13:58] <gseguin> yeah it's actually pretty accurate
[11:14:09] <gseguin> navigation has high complexity
[11:14:41] <_|Nix|_> Does codeclimate make specific suggestions about places where the code could use improvement - kinda like coverity, or is it something totally differen?
[11:14:42] <gseguin> well duh! We knew that already
[11:14:43] <gseguin> :)
[11:14:59] <gseguin> it just reports complexity
[11:15:04] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK.
[11:15:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does seem to at least target areas for improvment
[11:15:12] <uGoMobi> sounds complex
[11:15:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ...
[11:16:12] <gseguin> anyhow, we need to involve the board to talk to these guys to see if they would be willing to offer us free access
[11:16:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what is the next step?
[11:16:25] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:16:43] <gseguin> because the issue is if you just use the open-source side of their tool you don't have control on what you analize
[11:16:50] <gseguin> and so you get a crappy score
[11:17:00] <gseguin> s/analize/analyze/
[11:17:14] <uGoMobi> maybe you can inform DaveMethvin and kborchers
[11:17:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we can just put on agenda for dev leads
[11:17:29] <gseguin> arschmitz: you're an admin, feel free to add whoever so they can take a look
[11:17:42] <arschmitz> gseguin: cool will do
[11:17:45] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'll email you Mike's email address
[11:18:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: then kborchers DaveMethvin and scott_gonzalez can all look and they can go to board or whoever from there
[11:19:02] <gseguin> I told Mike that we would reach out if we think we're going to use the tool
[11:19:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, we have another Dev leads meeting before board meeting in SAN anyway
[11:19:35] <arschmitz> yup
[11:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> Are you talking about code climate?
[11:20:42] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: indeed
[11:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> You should go read https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1415
[11:20:45] <uGoMobi> yes we were
[11:23:17] <gseguin> so using it as an internal tool and not exposing the badge?
[11:23:25] <gseguin> fine
[11:24:06] <gseguin> we still need to work with these guys to figure out under what terms they would let us use it
[11:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> I think this stuff is a joke.
[11:24:48] <dam__> yes, that badge could give the wrong impression
[11:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> But maybe that's just me.
[11:25:34] <dam__> it might not be very useful to someone like scott_gonzalez, but for new contributors it might be nice to have data to determine if they are adding value
[11:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> I highly disagree with that.
[11:26:06] <uGoMobi> if they understand the results
[11:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> For example, adding reasonable tests dropped our grade from a D to an F: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/2ef1b16e4d...113e9d0c2c
[11:26:37] <dam__> right that was assuming that the results are easy to comprehend.
[11:26:50] <_|Nix|_> dam__: I don't think so.
[11:27:01] <_|Nix|_> dam__: If a new contributor gets an F, that might discourage them.
[11:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> Code complexity is actually a really bad metric to look at.
[11:27:08] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah, I excluded tests and external from the report
[11:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> It's extremely misleading.
[11:27:20] <dam__> that result definitely sways me
[11:27:21] <scott_gonzalez> Low code complexity != better readability or maintainability.
[11:27:31] <gseguin> that's why it should not be made public
[11:27:53] <gseguin> so we can keep an eye on things that are actually of value (if any)
[11:28:07] <gseguin> anyhow, I'm not pushing for using it
[11:28:10] <dam__> it is interesting since some useful code looks like it would always fail a complexity test
[11:28:16] <dam__> like dom traversal etc.
[11:28:27] <_|Nix|_> dam__: How can you "fail" a complexity test.
[11:28:34] <_|Nix|_> That's what gets me.
[11:28:40] <gseguin> I was just looking into it and reported on it
[11:28:41] <_|Nix|_> It's not a pass/fail thing.
[11:28:42] <dam__> totallu
[11:28:50] <dam__> right
[11:28:59] <_|Nix|_> The complexity of this code is X. Bam! Thanks for the info *shrug*
[11:29:05] <dam__> if anything complexity is a hot spot to verify
[11:29:32] <dam__> you look at what it points out and decide if you care
[11:29:32] <DaveMethvin> i think all the points were already laid out in the PR above ... I do think the measures have some value but putting them in badge form in the README file for armchair developers to critique is not a good thing
[11:29:33] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: totally agree with your statement
[11:30:05] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: yup we came up to the same conclusion
[11:30:20] <dam__> that PR discussion is really good
[11:30:45] <_|Nix|_> I suppose one positive aspect of having code complexity pointed out to you is to make you wonder: "Why does it have to be so complex?"
[11:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's all a lie ;-)
[11:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> Long functions are not inherintly complex.
[11:31:44] <dam__> I could see chasing complexity tests as a possible net zero yak shaving adventure
[11:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> But algorithms assume they are.
[11:32:08] <_|Nix|_> Right ...
[11:32:24] <dam__> might be interesting for a graduate student to write a paper on ;)
[11:32:30] <uGoMobi> right, what is definition of complex code
[11:32:45] <_|Nix|_> Well, that's probably where CC got started :)
[11:33:05] <dam__> zing
[11:33:13] <_|Nix|_> I'd rather have a tool that can identify leaks ...
[11:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Cyclomatic complexity is clearly defined.
[11:33:36] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, I'm done with this discussion...
[11:33:49] <uGoMobi> yeah, but if I would start contributing a jQuery project and were confronted with CC results I wouldn't know what it exactly tells me
[11:34:00] <dam__> :gavel:
[11:34:02] <uGoMobi> yeah, let's move on
[11:34:45] <uGoMobi> also at the bottom of the agenda is the API docs iframe examples
[11:35:04] <agcolom> yes, I'll try to do that soon
[11:35:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz : can you check my comment https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/213#issuecomment-33108028
[11:35:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great, thanks!
[11:36:14] <uGoMobi> we are going to change our PR review policy a bit
[11:36:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looks right to me
[11:36:44] <uGoMobi> meaning that not *all* PR's have to be reviewed by arschmitz
[11:36:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... looks about right. In fact, it'll be good to actually have agcolom do a live-fire test on using widgets outside pages.
[11:37:25] <uGoMobi> yeah, good idea to first just test with one
[11:37:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For example, popup does work outside the page, but the click-link-to-open-popup doesn't, because you also need the click handler.
[11:37:31] <agcolom> oh yes
[11:37:32] <uGoMobi> one widget
[11:37:50] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[11:37:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, if you want history, you need to resolve some deferreds.
[11:38:11] <dam__> any way you could add links to the code in question to that issue?
[11:38:37] <dam__> listview etc.
[11:38:59] <_|Nix|_> dam__: How do you mean? Code for each widget showing how you set it up outside the page?
[11:39:05] <dam__> no
[11:39:07] <arschmitz> about the PR's though just so its clear if the change your making is trivial like a typo or changeing wording etc... it still needs to be reviewed but it can be anyone
[11:39:14] <uGoMobi> dam__: basically that's a list of all our widgets https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/js/widgets
[11:39:19] <dam__> OK
[11:39:28] <arschmitz> if its a code or functional change in anyway it still needs to be reviewed by me
[11:39:55] <dam__> I've found that linking to where someone could make the change allows for more community contribution
[11:40:14] <uGoMobi> dam__: good point
[11:40:36] <dam__> for instance if I wanted to try to update one of these I would have no idea where to start
[11:40:43] <uGoMobi> dam__: in this case the issue about many of our API docs pages containing iframes for examples
[11:40:58] <dam__> I get that
[11:41:01] <uGoMobi> yeah you are right
[11:41:39] <dam__> you all know the code really well, I would like to get up to speed asap. Seems like a simple way to include more people. :)
[11:41:47] <_|Nix|_> dam__: You mean like this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/entries/controlgroup.xml#L18 ?
[11:41:48] <uGoMobi> we can add links to the pages with examples of thos widgets
[11:41:58] <uGoMobi> those*
[11:42:14] <dam__> _|Nix|_: Exactly
[11:42:43] <_|Nix|_> dam__: Well, TBH, grep -niH iframe entries/*xml will give you all the places you need.
[11:42:52] <uGoMobi> and something like "please inform agcolom if you want to help out with this"
[11:43:17] <dam__> *nods
[11:43:45] <_|Nix|_> dam__: I suppose I could comment that :)
[11:43:53] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:44:04] <dam__> was just doing that ;)
[11:44:17] <_|Nix|_> dam__: Aaah, excellent!
[11:44:35] <uGoMobi> probably good to repeat our new PR review policy because we were talking about two topics at the same time
[11:45:05] <arschmitz> sure
[11:45:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm good with it. 4 eyes if it's trivial, 2 eyes + arschmitz if it's not. Right?
[11:45:10] <uGoMobi> so, small changes - especially in docs and on the site - can be reviewed by any team member
[11:46:02] <uGoMobi> bigger changes, especially code and functional changes, still need to be reviewed by arschmitz first
[11:46:39] <agcolom> that's good, in particular when timezone is not our friend ;-)
[11:46:48] <arschmitz> yup
[11:47:09] <uGoMobi> right
[11:47:45] <uGoMobi> the component part of the commit message is used for sectioning the auto-generated changelog
[11:48:03] <uGoMobi> so we have to make a list of what component names we use
[11:48:13] <uGoMobi> some are obvious (widget names), others are not
[11:48:36] <uGoMobi> I noticed things like "source tree" and "gruntfile.js"
[11:48:49] <uGoMobi> I don't think we want separate sections for all of those
[11:48:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, especially the sweeping variety, like "Whitespace" ... or something like that.
[11:49:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whitespace is perfectly valid
[11:49:09] <arschmitz> those are all excluded
[11:49:43] <uGoMobi> but maybe easier to just use "coding standards"
[11:50:08] <uGoMobi> we also have to decide if we want to list widget extensions separate from the widget
[11:50:26] <arschmitz> i talked to scott_gonzalez about that
[11:50:32] <arschmitz> it seems like they should not be
[11:50:37] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:50:52] <uGoMobi> I will update the doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-FEBk1RkeWjsuwVztwYiqfdFN_993iwOrdHvgbI0Oc/edit) to reflect that
[11:51:28] <uGoMobi> feel free to comment on that doc
[11:51:40] <uGoMobi> would be great if we have a list by next week
[11:51:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why don't we add sections as we discover we need them?
[11:51:57] <uGoMobi> I will change the labels in the issue tracker because those should match
[11:52:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The number of times we add a new section should decrease quickly over time.
[11:52:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can always add or remove if needed
[11:53:04] <uGoMobi> but it's easier if we make a list and put it on a wiki page
[11:53:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I guess some things will go into disuse.
[11:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> "Whitespace" is not an acceptable commit message.
[11:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> "All: Whitespace" would be
[11:53:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Nono. A section.
[11:53:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Although I guess it's more of an action than a place.
[11:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> The sections in the changelog ARE the components.
[11:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> gruntfile.js is also not a component. Build is a component.
[11:54:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, but what if a change touches multiple components?
[11:55:06] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-FEBk1RkeWjsuwVztwYiqfdFN_993iwOrdHvgbI0Oc/edit)
[11:55:21] <arschmitz> those are what we are planning to use as components
[11:55:44] <uGoMobi> well that doc was just a first pass
[11:55:54] <agcolom> gotta run... speak later...
[11:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Then it's probably a sweeping change, which would fall under "All"
[11:55:55] <uGoMobi> need to remove the extensions etc.
[11:56:01] <uGoMobi> later agcolom
[11:56:35] <uGoMobi> one more thing I wanted to bring up
[11:56:48] <_|Nix|_> Another thing that's kinda inaccurate: Demos and Tests
[11:56:59] <uGoMobi> I noticed users are having problems with the change from page events to pagecontainer events
[11:57:07] <_|Nix|_> It should be at least "Demos: Navigation: Updated blurb about foo"
[11:57:13] <uGoMobi> nope
[11:57:17] <uGoMobi> just Demos and Tests
[11:57:37] <_|Nix|_> I guess ...
[11:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> Demos is not a catch-all component.
[11:58:15] <scott_gonzalez> Demos is the component for the demo infrastructure.
[11:58:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, if I make a change to the controlgroup demo, then where do I file it?
[11:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> If you're adding/modifying/fixing/whatever a demo for a specific widget, then the comopnent is the widget.
[11:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> You'd file it under controlgroup.
[11:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> Components have source, demos, docs, tests.
[11:59:42] <_|Nix|_> OK. Sounds good.
[11:59:57] <arschmitz> i agree with that
[12:00:33] <uGoMobi> ok, that's different from how we have done it before so we have fix the changelog manually
[12:00:48] <uGoMobi> I think all changes in demos have Demos as component now
[12:00:52] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[12:00:56] <uGoMobi> probably the same for tests
[12:01:14] <_|Nix|_> I used to do Test: Controlgroup: Blah blah blah
[12:01:20] <dam__> got to run. meeting overlap. Happy to be with you all!
[12:01:28] <uGoMobi> ok later dam__
[12:01:30] <arschmitz> we dont need to worry about past stuff
[12:01:35] <uGoMobi> dam__: thanks for joining
[12:01:43] <arschmitz> just do it right from now on there have not been many commits since 1.4
[12:01:45] <_|Nix|_> But since we've enforced the Component: description standard I switched to Tests: Blah blah controlgroup blah
[12:01:55] <arschmitz> they can easily be cleaned up when the change log is generated
[12:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, don't sweat the old stuff.
[12:02:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[12:02:33] <_|Nix|_> So, now it's gonna be Controlgroup: Blah test blah blah, or Controlgroup blah demo blah blah, or Controlroup: blah blah
[12:03:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's the idea
[12:03:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we can do a post on the learn site or add more info to the upgrade guide to help people with the page events --> pagecontainer events change
[12:04:10] <uGoMobi> see this comment for example https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6865#issuecomment-33080369
[12:04:21] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I guess we forgot that the new events are triggered on a different element.
[12:05:09] <uGoMobi> I saw similar comments on social media
[12:05:16] <uGoMobi> so that's something we have to address
[12:05:34] <_|Nix|_> OK. This is merely a doc problem.
[12:05:38] <_|Nix|_> No, wait.
[12:05:46] <_|Nix|_> THe old events are fired elsewhere too ..
[12:06:09] <uGoMobi> I gotta run too
[12:06:17] <uGoMobi> let's discuss that on -dev tomorrow
[12:06:24] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:06:32] <_|Nix|_> Actually old events are triggered on the page, if available.
[12:06:39] <_|Nix|_> So, it's merely a doc issue.
[12:07:22] <_|Nix|_> Anyhoo ... L8R
[12:07:44] <uGoMobi> anyone has anything else we need to discuss now?
[12:08:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll file a bug about the events.
[12:08:24] <uGoMobi> bug?
[12:08:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's discuss first
[12:08:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[12:09:03] <arschmitz> yeah lets discuss
[12:09:05] <arschmitz> on dev
[12:09:10] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:09:17] <uGoMobi> thanks all
