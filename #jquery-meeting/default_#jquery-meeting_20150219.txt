[09:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> Hi jperrault, snover, jrossi2.
[09:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's just us today.
[09:02:32] <arthurvr> hey-hey!
[09:02:33] <jrossi2> I'm sitting at the airport waiting to board, so I probably won't be here long.
[09:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi2: No problem, doesn't look like it will be a long meeting.
[09:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> Just two things on the agenda right now.
[09:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> One is the team issue: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/162
[09:03:21] <jperrault> o/
[09:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi2: I know you provided details last week in IRC, but can you comment on the issue as well?
[09:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Can you comment as well, since you're obviously active :-)
[09:04:16] <jperrault> so, for 162 (use intern) I think the problem is simple, but it seems that the itern is getting in the way.
[09:04:27] <jrossi2> yes, I will. I was hoping to button up the CLA first. But our VP is not on my good side at the moment since he won't reply to my mail. :-)
[09:04:43] <jrossi2> I will hunt him down in his office once I'm back in Seattle.
[09:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: You mean 153?
[09:04:54] <jperrault> oops, yes.
[09:05:04] <snover> it’s not possible for intern to “get in the way”
[09:08:21] <snover> there’s no dist in this branch, and the test task in Gruntfile.js/package.json is referencing tasks that don’t exist, so I’m not sure how you are executing this right now
[09:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> The dist file is generated by running `grunt`.
[09:09:06] <snover> yes, i see that
[09:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that tests reference `window.PointerEventsPolyfill` which doesn't exist when loaded via AMD.
[09:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Because instead of exposing a global, it's just a module.
[09:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> So https://github.com/JacquesPerrault/PEP/compare/use-intern-for-testing2#diff-14baddda22e4136a2f04bea10fcaad1cR14 needs to change.
[09:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> You should remove that line completely.
[09:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> And add `pep` to https://github.com/JacquesPerrault/PEP/compare/use-intern-for-testing2#diff-14baddda22e4136a2f04bea10fcaad1cR5
[09:13:29] <snover> jperrault: does what scott says make sense to you?
[09:13:41] <snover> please let us know that it is clear or if you need more guidance.
[09:14:11] <jperrault> I'm looking at the links now.
[09:16:41] <jperrault> got it
[09:16:59] <jperrault> that makes it happy.
[09:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess we can expect a PR pretty soon.
[09:17:17] <jperrault> yes.
[09:17:20] <jperrault> today.
[09:17:26] <arschmitz> Yay!
[09:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> wonderful
[09:20:24] <jperrault> So....I'm guessing that was the second agenda item...
[09:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'll set up Travis CI once the Intern PR lands.
[09:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll have continuous testing on every commit.
[09:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:23:54] <snover> i don’t have anything in particular. this will be a good first step and should open the door to other work.
[09:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, should give us more confidence to work on the code.
[09:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> Since we know that the tests will be running.
[09:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in #pep.
[11:00:59] <arschmitz> 'mobileteam assemble!
[11:01:45] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:01:46] <cgack> howdy
[11:01:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Present!
[11:01:49] <arthurvr> Hi!
[11:02:01] <arschmitz> b-ot: what the heck
[11:02:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: agcolom
[11:02:32] <arthurvr> arschmitz: don’t you need a backtick?
[11:02:32] <arschmitz> sfrisk:
[11:02:36] <arthurvr> `mobileteam
[11:02:36] <b-ot> arthurvr: agcolom, arschmitz, arthurvr, cgack, gabriel_schulhof, ianmaffett, jasperdegroot, sfrisk
[11:02:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Aaah, I see, it was supposed to kick in ...
[11:02:39] <agcolom> hello
[11:02:58] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:03:00] <arschmitz> I'm on phone ate it I guess
[11:03:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Does it also take off the moderation?
[11:03:31] <arschmitz> No scott_gonzalez never muted
[11:03:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes he did. I couldn't send to channel when I tried to say "Present!"
[11:04:13] <arthurvr> Yup. It was muted. :-)
[11:04:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyhoo ...
[11:04:49] <arschmitz> 2 seconds while I walk inside
[11:06:01] <arschmitz> ok
[11:06:15] <arschmitz> apparently commands dont work from my phone
[11:06:48] <arschmitz> because i unmuted and it did nothing so i thought it already was but gabriel_schulhof did it lol
[11:06:49] <agcolom> sorry on the phone for a sec...
[11:07:20] <arschmitz> ok so agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=1542548566
[11:08:57] <arschmitz> So main thing this week is finally getting new PR's for classes updates
[11:09:49] <arschmitz> im reviewing them right now
[11:10:14] <arschmitz> after which ill be doing more work on classes for UI still trying to get that onto master
[11:10:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i know you have runinto some things but i think they are all addressed correct?
[11:11:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Correct.
[11:11:31] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm just crossing my fingers that this does not kill listview performance.
[11:12:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there are better ways to address that
[11:12:23] <arschmitz> list view could potentially have tons of perf optimizations we are not currently doing
[11:12:32] <arschmitz> the biggest one is to use the css only :-)
[11:12:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess listview should be a top candidate for Chassis.
[11:13:22] <gabriel_schulhof> OTOH, there may still be a place for convenience code to deal with listviews.
[11:13:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its no different then button
[11:13:46] <arschmitz> you dont need JS but its there if you want it
[11:13:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and actually, after 1.5.0 we should be a lot closer to having css-only listviews, because it will support the enhanced option.
[11:14:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we already have them
[11:14:11] <arschmitz> just dont include the widget and do the markup your self
[11:14:23] <arschmitz> iv used them since 1.3
[11:14:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, but in 1.5.0, the widget will not burn unnecessary cycles, so it can coexist.
[11:15:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyhoo, so yeah, listview is on its way.
[11:15:42] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and while we're on the topic of classes, have you had a chance to think about enhanced + classes?
[11:16:02] <arschmitz> im leaning toward just doing addClass
[11:16:09] <arschmitz> _addClass to track
[11:16:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that's the simplest.
[11:16:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ... unless for some unfathomable reason it completely obliterates the performance advantage of doing enhanced.
[11:17:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we can check on listview lol
[11:17:35] <arschmitz> thats the best place to check if its going to matter
[11:17:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, actually, I'm planning on perf-ing it after I'm done.
[11:17:55] <arschmitz> because its where enhanced "should" save a lot with linked lists
[11:18:06] <arschmitz> it addes classes to every element and an icon
[11:18:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep ...
[11:18:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, crap, that's right ... data-icon="something" ... ugh ...
[11:19:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyhoo ... so yeah, adventure awaits in the company of the listview :)
[11:22:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cgack: anything else related to classes?
[11:23:18] <cgack> not at the moment, really just got started focusing on it today
[11:23:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Nope. Just gotta battle through the task.
[11:23:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I wrote an implementation of .eachIdle() I want to try with table when I get back to it.
[11:23:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats also useful for listview
[11:24:00] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/blob/master/js/eachIdle.js
[11:24:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Good point.
[11:24:32] <arschmitz> thats one of the more significant perf improvements i was talking about before.
[11:25:42] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. If you want me to use eachIdle on listview, we need to add options for controlling the idling: https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/blob/master/js/eachIdle.js#L43
[11:25:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we dont need to worry about that right this second
[11:26:23] <arschmitz> i was just pointing out that thats one of the ways we can address performance in listview if classes has a negative effect
[11:27:09] <gabriel_schulhof> That's true, but it's not a drop-in solution, because it can have deep effects in the architecture of an application.
[11:27:30] <gabriel_schulhof> idle === async whereas before it was sync.
[11:27:51] <arschmitz> yup in both cases this would be an extension / option i think
[11:28:10] <arschmitz> because you would want to be able to force normal sync behavior when you want.
[11:28:10] <gabriel_schulhof> I smell 1.6.0 ...
[11:28:20] <arschmitz> very likely
[11:28:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, eachIdle is sync for small sets, but only after an initial unwind
[11:29:10] <gabriel_schulhof> The initial unwind can be removed, but I felt that it should be there because using eachIdle should force devs into the async mindset.
[11:29:24] <gabriel_schulhof> You tell it to unwind after 100ms, for example.
[11:30:26] <arschmitz> yeah we can go into details of that either in issue / pr or dev
[11:30:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway. Let's get classes into master, and then we can play with this.
[11:31:04] <gabriel_schulhof> It was fun to write and test, but we'll see if it can actually handle itself in the wild.
[11:31:05] <arschmitz> yup
[11:32:20] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so that's all I have about classes.
[11:32:54] <arschmitz> i think we didnt get to this last time
[11:33:04] <arschmitz> but data-attriute name space
[11:33:09] <arschmitz> we wanted to do this in 1.5
[11:33:20] <arschmitz> im thinking at this point 1.6 might be better
[11:33:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[11:33:48] <gabriel_schulhof> I think we can deprecate though without writing any code or new docs or anything.
[11:34:04] <arschmitz> well we can backcompat this
[11:34:18] <arschmitz> or my other thought
[11:34:21] <arschmitz> is wait for 2.0
[11:34:22] <gabriel_schulhof> We can use 1.5.0 to encourage people to set it to "ui-", saying that it will be irrevocably set to "ui-" as of 1.6.0
[11:34:35] <arschmitz> since it requires HUGE markup change\s
[11:35:02] <gabriel_schulhof> That's cool, too.
[11:35:14] <arschmitz> kinda like qunit has done
[11:35:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Either way, I think this does not require us to write any backcompat code.
[11:35:31] <arschmitz> in current version they said hey this will be the api in 2.0
[11:35:39] <gabriel_schulhof> The presence of $.mobile.ns /is/ the backcompat.
[11:35:43] <arschmitz> you can use it today
[11:35:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Exactly.
[11:36:12] <gabriel_schulhof> So, all we need to do is say "Well, you are now strongly encouraged to use it, because such usage will become the only way."
[11:36:25] <arschmitz> yeah im leaning towards leaving it in until 2.0 though
[11:36:38] <gabriel_schulhof> How systematic is the required change?
[11:36:47] <arschmitz> because its a bigger change to your markup then pretty much anything else we have ever done
[11:37:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Can you just cat | sed?
[11:37:11] <arschmitz> no
[11:37:28] <arschmitz> because you could be using multiple things that use data-attributes
[11:37:31] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, I can think of a regex that will leave all other frameworks' data settings alone, as long as they use namespaces.
[11:37:44] <arschmitz> right but we dont use a name space
[11:37:47] <arschmitz> so we cant assume others do
[11:37:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess that's the crux of it.
[11:38:30] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. 2.0 it is.
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: jasperdegroot: cgack: thoughts?
[11:38:57] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and because it's such a huge change, we may want to start trumpeting it Real Soon Now™
[11:39:15] <arschmitz> yes that would be the idea
[11:39:16] <jasperdegroot> +1 to 2.0
[11:39:18] <arschmitz> announce in 1.5
[11:39:24] <arschmitz> but leave until 2.0
[11:39:25] <agcolom> happy with encouraging people to use new ui- as soon as supported and leave until at least 1.6
[11:39:35] <agcolom> or 2.0 even better
[11:39:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: no matter what 1.6 is the soonest it could be removed
[11:39:53] <cgack> announce now, and continue to announce (reminders) until 2.0 works for me
[11:39:59] <arschmitz> the question i think is 1.6 and we do backcopmpat
[11:40:03] <arschmitz> or 2.0 and we dont
[11:40:06] <agcolom> I'd say no
[11:40:49] <arschmitz> ok so i think it sounds like everyone agrees 2.0?
[11:40:59] <gabriel_schulhof> IMO doing backcompat would be insane ... I mean, we would be looking for two data attributes for every one option we have ...
[11:41:04] <agcolom> People don't have to upgrade. Each upgrade comes with a caveat. Everyone should expect that
[11:41:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[11:41:34] <gabriel_schulhof> IMO $( document ).on( "mobileinit", function() { $.mobile.ns = "ui-" }); /is/ the backcompat.
[11:42:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: agcolom: so are you saying you prefer 1.6 or 2.0 ?
[11:42:36] <arschmitz> regardless of backcompat
[11:42:36] <agcolom> for?
[11:42:38] <gabriel_schulhof> We can't possibly thin out the one step where they need to go over all their markup and change all our data-attributes to have a namespace while leaving all other non-namespaced frameworks' data attributes alone.
[11:42:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm saying 2.0 and no effort on our part other than trumpeting.
[11:43:09] <agcolom> sounds good
[11:43:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Go forth and $.mobile.ns = "ui-"!
[11:43:17] <arschmitz> agcolom: when we remove the ability to change your ns
[11:43:35] <agcolom> I'd say 2.0 if possible
[11:43:42] <arschmitz> ok
[11:43:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Shout it from the mountaintops!
[11:44:10] <arschmitz> as much as i dislike our data- namespace handling im fine with waiting for 2.0 also
[11:44:22] <arschmitz> its not "hurting" anything
[11:44:27] <jasperdegroot> does it hold us up in any way if we wait until 2.0?
[11:44:34] <jasperdegroot> oh, you just answered :)
[11:44:41] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: well one minor thing
[11:44:58] <arschmitz> the auto init module needs to have special handling and or a dependency
[11:45:14] <arschmitz> and we had been hoping to keep it free other then the factory and core
[11:45:45] <arschmitz> there is no way to avoid it containing "$.mobile" if we do this
[11:45:45] <jasperdegroot> I see
[11:45:56] <arschmitz> until 2.0
[11:46:13] <arschmitz> previously it only would in 1.5
[11:46:24] <arschmitz> as a small backcompat shim
[11:46:50] <arschmitz> not end of the world but it is one thing that is effected
[11:47:37] <gabriel_schulhof> http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/ns-change.jpg
[11:47:53] <arschmitz> lol
[11:48:05] <jasperdegroot> :D
[11:48:28] <arschmitz> ok so since i mentioned autoinit
[11:48:42] <arschmitz> now that i know our direction here i can finish that
[11:48:50] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I suggest you make an annoying popup with that pic for the jquerymobile.com homepage
[11:49:02] <agcolom> what do we put in the for data- attribute name space?
[11:49:18] <agcolom> I've put wait until 2.0
[11:49:23] <arschmitz> waiting for 2.0 but announcing in 1.5
[11:49:26] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't want to get the foundation in trouble for copyright infringement - although it could be considered a derivative work, so allowed.
[11:49:33] <agcolom> do we says also no backcompat?
[11:49:35] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:49:45] <jasperdegroot> nothing in 2.0 has backcompat
[11:50:11] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: We have backcompat, just not the nice kind where the code accepts namespaced and, if absent, also checks for non-namespaced.
[11:50:19] <agcolom> sure, ok
[11:50:22] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah maybe just that the change will not be backwards compatible but that you can update to use new api in any previous version
[11:50:35] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: Our backcompat is that we support namespaced even today.
[11:50:45] <agcolom> right ok
[11:50:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: right but we wont support custom ns in future
[11:51:05] <agcolom> "will wait until 2.0, and encourage people to use as of 1.5"
[11:51:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The autoinit is already extensible, right?
[11:51:11] <arschmitz> so we are making a non backwards compatible change
[11:51:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah actually that specific piece is
[11:51:34] <arschmitz> its a single line
[11:51:37] <arschmitz> so we can just extend it
[11:51:44] <gabriel_schulhof> There ya go.
[11:51:48] <arschmitz> and i can leave the core "pure"
[11:51:49] <gabriel_schulhof> autoinit can stay pure.
[11:51:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[11:52:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Also, since we now have a bulk way of grabbing data, is it so expensive to provide true backcompat, where you first check namespaced, and, if absent, check also non-namespaced?
[11:52:42] <gabriel_schulhof> It could be done without additional DOM access, right?
[11:52:51] <arschmitz> yes
[11:53:02] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and without polluting the core autoinit.
[11:53:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it was never a "problem" to provide backcompat
[11:54:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, still ... let's wait, because we use $.mobile.ns in many more places than just autoinit.
[11:54:13] <arschmitz> yup
[11:54:28] <gabriel_schulhof> find js -type f | xargs grep -niH '\$\.mobile\.ns' | wc gives 45 occurrences
[11:54:43] <arschmitz> thats actually not bad
[11:55:35] <gabriel_schulhof> TBH I think we have more important things to do - like nav.
[11:55:52] <arschmitz> yup
[11:55:56] <gabriel_schulhof> The trumpeting will get us away from the configurable namespace "for free".
[11:56:05] <arschmitz> exactly
[11:56:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, and we can make all our demos have the NS.
[11:56:20] <arschmitz> that was my exact motivation for waiting
[11:56:44] <gabriel_schulhof> OTOH, that may result in a myriad of bugs saying our demos don't work.
[11:56:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... when pasted.
[11:56:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we can also put the setting of it to "" behind $.mobile.backcompat
[11:57:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaah, excellent!
[11:57:25] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll make an issue.
[11:57:59] <arschmitz> so if you set $.mobile.backcompat = false or exclude all backcompat in build
[11:58:03] <arschmitz> it will be -ui
[11:59:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait, what? Not "ui-"? It's "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "optionname", right?
[11:59:39] <gabriel_schulhof> So, it needs to be "ui-", not "-ui".
[11:59:40] <arschmitz> yes sorry typo
[11:59:49] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Phew ...
[12:00:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, with all the RTL talk going on recently :)
[12:01:08] <arschmitz> ok next is team page
[12:01:15] <gabriel_schulhof> We can do this $.mobileBackcompat thing for 1.5.0, I think. It should be a snap.
[12:01:36] <arschmitz> i just wanted to point out this change to jquery.org/team so no one is suprised
[12:01:51] <arschmitz> all the team members are being removed from that page
[12:02:15] <arschmitz> if we want to have a team page we need to make our own on jquerymobile.com
[12:02:31] <agcolom> We can do what ui is doing, with a small bio for everyone on jquerymobile.com
[12:02:39] <arschmitz> yup
[12:03:05] <arschmitz> we have this currently too but its out dated http://jquerymobile.com/about/
[12:03:31] <agcolom> I liked the team page as it is today, but it was decided that with all the new projects coming to the Foundation, it will become unmanageable
[12:03:54] <agcolom> oh dear!
[12:04:15] * agcolom sees how out of date this is!
[12:04:21] <jasperdegroot> lol
[12:04:28] <agcolom> my schedule is crazy until jQuery UK
[12:04:37] <agcolom> I'll have more time after that.
[12:04:38] <arschmitz> i forget this page exists
[12:04:48] <agcolom> I'm still working on my demo and talk
[12:05:22] <jasperdegroot> shouldn't be that hard to make a new page
[12:05:53] <agcolom> Why not keep it under about?
[12:06:08] <agcolom> that's what ui is doing
[12:06:37] <jasperdegroot> I see
[12:06:43] <jasperdegroot> yeah we could do that
[12:06:47] <agcolom> because it's not as if we have a big team ;-)
[12:06:49] <jasperdegroot> and move the section to the bottom
[12:07:10] <jasperdegroot> true
[12:07:25] <agcolom> we could have quick nav links on that page also...
[12:07:28] <jasperdegroot> can probably copy the style from UI then
[12:07:53] <jasperdegroot> for the avatars and text block alignment
[12:08:04] <jasperdegroot> or maybe it's in the WP theme already
[12:08:39] <agcolom> ui doesn't use avatars
[12:08:45] <agcolom> http://jqueryui.com/about/
[12:08:58] <jasperdegroot> ahh
[12:09:00] <jasperdegroot> you're right
[12:09:00] <agcolom> did you mean the current team page on .org?
[12:09:07] <jasperdegroot> was looking at 2 pages at same time
[12:09:17] <agcolom> ;-)
[12:09:20] <jasperdegroot> yeah, we use gravatars there
[12:09:45] <agcolom> I'd be happy to add the gravatars
[12:09:47] <arschmitz> we can make whatever we want
[12:10:13] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: we can just copy the links from jquery.org/team
[12:10:17] <arschmitz> im happy with whatever people want but i think we should recognize our team members
[12:10:29] <agcolom> yes and yes
[12:10:43] <jasperdegroot> let's create a branch on jquerymobile.com
[12:10:51] <agcolom> sounds good
[12:10:59] <jasperdegroot> I can add some style if the theme doesn't provide one
[12:11:11] <jasperdegroot> everyone can do a PR with text about her/himself
[12:11:42] <agcolom> +1
[12:12:01] <gabriel_schulhof> +1
[12:12:05] <arschmitz> +1
[12:12:07] <jasperdegroot> we link to our GH profiles
[12:12:07] <cgack> +1
[12:12:26] <agcolom> yes, I'd be happy with some consistency for that so +1
[12:12:36] <jasperdegroot> you could also at your Twitter if you want
[12:12:59] <jasperdegroot> but not many of us are very active there I think
[12:13:19] <gabriel_schulhof> What's a twitter?
[12:13:22] <agcolom> I'm happy with both options.
[12:13:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Neah, JK :)
[12:13:25] <jasperdegroot> right
[12:13:27] <jasperdegroot> lol
[12:13:54] <agcolom> or we could have at least GH and Twitter for those who want to?
[12:13:58] <arschmitz> i think we can do one or both
[12:14:03] <arschmitz> but GH for sure
[12:14:07] <jasperdegroot> sure
[12:14:52] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: and anne and i both tweet once a month or so :-p
[12:15:14] <jasperdegroot> lol
[12:15:17] <gabriel_schulhof> You need to get that looked at :)
[12:15:29] <jasperdegroot> and big chance it is a retweet
[12:15:37] <arschmitz> lol
[12:16:51] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sign the cla :-)
[12:17:00] <arschmitz> or fix your git config
