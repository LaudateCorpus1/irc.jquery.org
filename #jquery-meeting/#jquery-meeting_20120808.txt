[08:59:22] <rworth> hey
[08:59:35] * rworth jumped the gun by a min
[09:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[09:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer probably won't be here, he's doing a training in Romania.
[09:01:42] <rworth> ok
[09:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone else here?
[09:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers gnarf
[09:02:50] <kborchers> sorry, i'm here. forgot :)
[09:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's get started.
[09:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> We're making good progress on the API site.
[09:04:12] <scott_gonzalez> Fleshed out a lot of the existing widget docs, still some more to do.
[09:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> And we moved more of the common APIs into inherits.
[09:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> Live demos work now.
[09:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> We found a clean way to share the XSL across projects and still have customized templates per-project.
[09:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks to Laurent Goderre.
[09:05:22] <rworth> yay
[09:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI are now using the same base XSL file.
[09:05:47] <rworth> where does it live?
[09:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> Right now it's duplicated in each repo.
[09:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> Once things settle down a bit, we'll move it out.
[09:06:14] <rworth> ok
[09:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> Probably into grunt-jquery-content.
[09:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'll continue working on API docs this week.
[09:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> One big thing we're missing is <signature> support for widget methods.
[09:10:29] <rworth> is there an open issue for that?
[09:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/27
[09:10:45] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #27 on api.jqueryui.com (scottgonzalez; 4d, 19h ago): Add support for <signature>
[09:12:01] <rworth> I'll take that one
[09:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> We're still waiting on jQuery Color 2.0.0, it should be ready by the end of the week :-)
[09:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you have an update on download builder?
[09:15:05] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I am working on its unit tests. I have a work in progress PR made.
[09:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:15:17] <gnarf> here now
[09:16:00] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, it black-box tests it by unpacking the zip and checking if the content is the expected.
[09:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:16:30] <rxaviers> but need to finish it :)
[09:17:00] <rxaviers> any question in particular?
[09:17:04] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> Just looking for a general update. "working on unit tests" was good :-)
[09:17:39] <rxaviers> :)
[09:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> The upgrade guide is done :-)
[09:17:52] <rxaviers> ok, so I think basically that's it I have for this week. Didnt have much time :(
[09:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone wants to review it, that'd probably be good: https://gist.github.com/4b08ed85f1302cf1005b
[09:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: No problem. I'm hoping for an end-of-month release date.
[09:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting a bit nervous about hitting that, but we're making good progress on everything.
[09:19:18] <gnarf> I'm gonna see if I can't get a staged download builder today
[09:19:24] <gnarf> for jzaefferer
[09:19:41] <rworth> sweet
[09:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Are you working with the designers to get jqueryui.com started?
[09:22:33] <rworth> will talk to them today, yes
[09:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Have you started the markdown -> html build process?
[09:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I might work on that today.
[09:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get the upgrade guide committed somewhere :-)
[09:24:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: no i haven't. i was focused on those api changes and didn't get to anything on jqueryui.com
[09:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll work on that after this meeting.
[09:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully that'll be nice and easy.
[09:25:08] <kborchers> famous last words :P
[09:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's not XSLT, so...
[09:26:55] <kborchers> :)
[09:27:54] <gnarf> heh
[09:28:06] <rworth> I heard scott_gonzalez is looking forward to maintaining all our XSLT going forward ;
[09:28:09] <rworth> )
[09:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I'll just find a way to bribe Laurent.
[09:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I think I *need* to go up to Canada and work with him in-person...and eat some poutine :-P
[09:30:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i should probably go with you. traveling to such a distant, foreign land alone is dangerous
[09:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> confirm
[09:31:02] <kborchers> :)
[09:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> Besides, you know some XSL, so I may need you to translate for me :-P
[09:31:16] <kborchers> :D
[09:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> K: "When he says xsl:param, what he means is parameter" S: "Ohhh..."
[09:31:45] <rworth> haha
[09:31:59] <kborchers> lol
[09:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Just for the record, a lot of what's going on is still pure magic to me.
[09:33:29] <rworth> embrace the innocence
[09:33:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: what you don't realize is that it is actually magic and you are on your way to becoming an actual wizard
[09:34:19] <kborchers> there is no logical explanation, just magic :P
[09:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> sweet
[09:35:19] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2An0fuHW8E
[09:35:44] <kborchers> hahaha
[09:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:39:36] <kborchers> nope
[09:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> See everyone back in -dev.
