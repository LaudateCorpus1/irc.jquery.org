[11:01:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: agcolom: cgack: gseguin: Meeting time
[11:01:55] <agcolom> hey :-)
[11:02:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Good evening!
[11:02:14] <gabriel_schulhof> ... for some.
[11:02:20] <cgack> howdy!
[11:02:47] <gseguin> Sorry guys I can't make the meeting today
[11:02:59] <gabriel_schulhof> gseguin: Hi! Bye!
[11:03:30] <ldeluca2> hi
[11:03:44] <cgack> hi ldeluca2
[11:03:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca2: Hey!
[11:04:21] <arschmitz> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=47
[11:06:56] <arschmitz> ok lets start with 1.4.5
[11:07:03] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:07:03] <arschmitz> we need to recheck these issues
[11:07:18] <arschmitz> apple actually fixed safari in a patch
[11:07:19] <jasperdegroot> sorry for being late... had connection troubles :(
[11:07:30] <arschmitz> at least one of the issues we had was fixed
[11:07:52] <arschmitz> im hoping the selectmenu one might have been as well in which case we can go back to not doing a 1.4.5
[11:09:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... the delaying-the-blur issue was fixed in the browser?
[11:09:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont know i said we need to check
[11:09:45] <arschmitz> there was a rendering issue that was pretty major they fixed though
[11:09:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: BS has iOS 8 ...
[11:10:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i will check with my phone
[11:10:28] <arschmitz> a full on browser crash is major enough im hoping they fixed it
[11:10:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, OK. You have iOS8 ... cool!
[11:10:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Indeed.
[11:10:46] <gabriel_schulhof> You didn't need jQM for the crash to happen.
[11:10:53] <arschmitz> nope
[11:11:16] <arschmitz> so fingers crossed on that being fixed
[11:12:24] <arschmitz> for 1.5 not too much real progress this week i dont think im working on a bunch of updates in ui that need to be pull before anything can be landed
[11:12:48] <arschmitz> those should be done in the next week
[11:13:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I've certainly made progress.
[11:13:24] <gabriel_schulhof> ... on my classes PRs.
[11:13:30] <arschmitz> yeah i saw some commits
[11:13:35] <arschmitz> i have not looked yet though
[11:13:48] <gabriel_schulhof> I've gotten them all to update the classes values in response to style option changes.
[11:14:00] <gabriel_schulhof> 6 widgets.
[11:14:17] <gabriel_schulhof> 3 don't need that.
[11:14:18] <arschmitz> by just proxying to classes with set options or?
[11:14:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Basically, I've kept the code for actually adding the classes to the element, but I'm using a common module for parsing/modifying the value of the class key.
[11:15:12] <agcolom> gabriel_schulhof: so entry for classes in notes was PR's need updating. Now can be PRs have been updated?
[11:15:38] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: Nono. I still need to change the default empty value for the class keys from null to "".
[11:15:44] <agcolom> ok
[11:15:48] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: ... but that's a fairly mechanical change.
[11:16:03] <agcolom> ok, should we change the status in notes for that?
[11:16:14] <agcolom> i.e. progress being made
[11:16:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, when we hack out the style options, we can simply get rid of the backcompat module, the existing _setOptions code, and all the calls to the backcompat module.
[11:17:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[11:17:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The good thing about using the module is that if you remove it, you'll get undefined reference errors in all the places where you need to remove code.
[11:18:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sounds good
[11:18:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, so if you see the same code in all the PRs, that's not separate commits. That's the same commit on all the branches.
[11:19:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, that's it for my work on classes.
[11:19:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that should probably be a seperate pr really then
[11:19:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I guess we can merge it into ui-1-12 and then rebase them on top.
[11:19:48] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but I'd leave it for now, awaiting the test fixes.
[11:19:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats what i was thinking
[11:20:05] <gabriel_schulhof> I could really use a passing test suite.
[11:20:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what failures specificly
[11:21:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, my ui-1-12-test-fixes PR fixes everything except checkboxradio.
[11:21:14] <gabriel_schulhof> So that's all that's left.
[11:21:32] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and I know you're busy, so don't worry about it. There's plenty of other stuff I can do in the meantime.
[11:21:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok ill review that so we can get it landed later today
[11:21:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that should make most of the tests green.
[11:21:53] <arschmitz> the checkboxradio one will have to wait for the rest of the ui updates
[11:22:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. No worries.
[11:22:23] <gabriel_schulhof> A review of that test fixes PR would actually cover most of the classes options-related stuff.
[11:22:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok ill look at it this afternoon
[11:22:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome! Thanks!
[11:23:48] <arschmitz> hopefully in the next week all the classes updates and the button checkboxradio and controlgroup updates will be done
[11:24:19] <gabriel_schulhof> That'll be a helluva landing.
[11:24:45] <arschmitz> lol
[11:24:51] <arschmitz> yeah im pretty busy right now lol
[11:25:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: any progress on updating the css?
[11:26:12] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, you can follow it here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7753
[11:26:30] <jasperdegroot> button-css branch is also used for icon spans now
[11:27:00] <jasperdegroot> working on updating the button and icon demo pages
[11:27:21] <jasperdegroot> to see if it work as expected
[11:27:33] <arschmitz> execlent
[11:27:50] <jasperdegroot> then need to updated all widgets that use icons to generate a span instead of adding class to anchor element
[11:27:56] <jasperdegroot> listview, collapsible, etc.
[11:27:57] <arschmitz> that will be super helpfull when checking the other pr's
[11:28:18] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: maybe gabriel_schulhof could help with that if you want?
[11:28:33] <jasperdegroot> yeah that would be great
[11:28:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Whew!
[11:28:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Sounds like fun!
[11:29:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Other fun things: Documenting the classes options in the API docs.
[11:29:19] <jasperdegroot> I'll update  the PR comment to mention all specific widgets instead of "Update all widgets that use icons to generate spans instead of adding icon class to the anchor"
[11:29:30] <arschmitz> yup
[11:29:37] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: ... and add a checklist
[11:29:42] <gabriel_schulhof> ... if not already there
[11:29:47] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: there is a checklist
[11:29:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Great!
[11:29:53] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i wonder if you can nest checklists lol
[11:29:59] <gabriel_schulhof> You can.
[11:30:03] <jasperdegroot> but I didn't make a bullet for each widget, just one generic one
[11:30:20] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I was wondering the same :)
[11:30:30] <cgack> jasperdegroot: ping me if there's anything I can help out with
[11:30:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: casper is happy with cdn.rawgit.com
[11:31:22] <jasperdegroot> cgack: the rewritten navbar widget also need to generate spans for icons
[11:31:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: they explicitly say to use that for production which we essentially are
[11:31:33] <jasperdegroot> or does it depend on button widget for the buttons?
[11:31:35] <arschmitz> so thats good and its cached forever
[11:31:45] <arschmitz> so as long as we stick to tags all will be right
[11:33:46] <arschmitz> ok so jsbin links
[11:34:14] <arschmitz> Remy fixed linking bins for us a while back but there is a special way to handle this
[11:34:34] <arschmitz> simple quick way for now is to add .html it the bin version number
[11:35:12] <arschmitz> this can also be done by changeing the x-requested-with header in the ajaxSetup
[11:35:45] <arschmitz> i want to add the second one to our template
[11:36:00] <arschmitz> however im working on trying to get us some jsbin vanity urls
[11:36:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: How about just adding a comment pointing out that people should be adding .html to external page links?
[11:36:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: just adding that what can be 1 line snippit just makes it work
[11:36:41] <arschmitz> and makes it possible to reproduce issues with url parsing
[11:36:49] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:37:11] <arschmitz> Vanity urls will be nice if we can get them though
[11:37:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaah, yes, actually. Like the missing closing /
[11:37:27] <arschmitz> so we can update the template with out changing the url
[11:37:42] <arschmitz> and get something nice like jsbin.com/jquery-mobile/
[11:37:52] <jasperdegroot> that would be nice
[11:38:13] <arschmitz> so im waiting to hopefully hear back about that before we update the template
[11:39:08] <gabriel_schulhof> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M68wcB6L0s
[11:40:02] <arschmitz> ok website spider
[11:40:10] <arschmitz> we have had a spider on our demos for a while now
[11:40:35] <arschmitz> iv been putting more work into this since chicago and its now a grunt plugin
[11:40:50] <arschmitz> and we will be using it on all the jquery websites
[11:41:17] <arschmitz> its already found a LOT of broken links we had no idea about
[11:42:31] <arschmitz> like in the api all links to other sites in old versions so like in the 1.3 api
[11:42:36] <arschmitz> all links were broken
[11:44:56] <jasperdegroot> I hope the API links I added back for 1.5 are not broken :)
[11:45:10] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no this was links from the api not to it
[11:45:22] <jasperdegroot> ah ok, misunderstood
[11:45:34] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: it was wordpress doing some url re-writing
[11:46:12] <jasperdegroot> :(
[11:46:27] <arschmitz> its fixed everywhere now
[11:47:14] <arschmitz> so dont be suprised to see a lot of link fix commits in the next few weeks on the content sites im not bothering with prs on any of the sites its too time consuming for simple fixes
[11:47:33] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:47:53] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:49:31] <arschmitz> so far jquery.com, api.jqueryui.com, the ui demos, and the mobile demos are all green
[11:49:59] <arschmitz> Cordova
[11:50:18] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: has been helping out on all our old sad neglected cordova and phonegap issues
[11:50:27] <ldeluca2> :)
[11:50:31] <gabriel_schulhof> :+1:
[11:50:37] <arschmitz> which is a huge help
[11:50:49] <arschmitz> we are pretty terrible and lazy about these issues
[11:51:17] <arschmitz> so this is really good since thats a big audience for us
[11:51:24] <ldeluca2> happy to help out! Feel free to add my name to issues related to Cordova and I'll dive in.  arschmitz has already done it for a few
[11:51:43] <jasperdegroot> awesome
[11:51:43] <arschmitz> one thing i think we should lookinto is something like grunt-cordova
[11:52:20] <arschmitz> maybe we could package the demos as a cordova app for easy testing on issues
[11:53:06] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: good idea
[11:53:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Too bad you can't launch a cordova app on BS :/
[11:53:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah
[11:53:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Not that BS is that great anymore ... it's dog slow.
[11:53:36] <ldeluca2> gabriel_schulhof: I found genymotion is to be way easier to test for Cordova than BS
[11:53:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its always been slow
[11:53:45] <ldeluca2> gabriel_schulhof: at least for android
[11:54:40] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: have not tried that will check it out
[11:58:38] <arschmitz> ok moving on
[11:58:47] <arschmitz> just one thing left
[11:58:59] <arschmitz> Welcome! Cory!
[11:59:18] <cgack> thanks!
[11:59:23] <jasperdegroot> Welcome!
[11:59:34] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Welcome!
[11:59:59] <jasperdegroot> \O/
[12:00:13] <cgack> hopefully I don't break too much now that I have more access to the repos :)
[12:00:27] <jasperdegroot> lol
[12:01:02] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: That's exactly how I felt when I joined :)
[12:01:17] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: ... and I did slip up a few times.
[12:01:36] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Don't sweat it. It's git. It's not like you lose anything.
[12:01:40] <cgack> distributed source control FTW
[12:01:42] <arschmitz> cgack: we all break things
[12:01:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[12:02:16] <arschmitz> you cant really break real stuff till you have cdn access
[12:02:36] <arschmitz> oops broke the internet...
[12:02:44] <cgack> haha
[12:02:46] <arschmitz> anyway does anyone have anything else?
[12:03:17] <jasperdegroot> I am good
[12:03:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Same here.
[12:03:40] <arschmitz> Anything from the community?
[12:04:12] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back on -dev
