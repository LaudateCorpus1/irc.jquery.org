[14:08:03] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time
[14:08:14] <sfrisk> kristjy, arschmitz, nashvail, geekman-rohit
[14:08:22] <kristyjy> Hi
[14:11:44] <sfrisk> okay first up while I get the meeting notes up (sorry, in the middle of work right now)
[14:11:48] <sfrisk> how are tables, kristyjy
[14:13:07] <kristyjy> Saw you guys had some feedback after the meeting I missed last week. Was hoping to compile it all this week and get that all buttoned up
[14:13:16] <kristyjy> so anyone else who wants to review please do :)
[14:15:03] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:16:18] <sfrisk> Okay, nashvail updated the input pr
[14:17:24] <nashvail> Yes, I am using tables for inline labels with inputs not sure if that's the way to go
[14:17:49] <sfrisk> I've updated the upstream branch
[14:18:00] <sfrisk> so in like 5 minutes that will be viewable on views.css-chassis.com
[14:18:15] <sfrisk> in general, do not use tables for layout
[14:18:23] <sfrisk> nope nope nope
[14:18:44] <sfrisk> inline labels/inputs are normally achieved using divs or something like that
[14:18:54] <nashvail> alright alright alright
[14:18:58] <nashvail> I'll fix that
[14:19:26] <sfrisk> learn from mistakes and horrors sarah's youth!  table based layouts lead to pain and sadness
[14:19:56] <nashvail> I am no strager to that ðŸ˜„
[14:20:05] <nashvail> stranger*
[14:20:33] <nashvail> So there are four sizes now
[14:20:43] <nashvail> xs - s (default) - md and lg
[14:20:50] <nashvail> both labels and inputs
[14:22:44] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/input-styling/demos/inputs.html
[14:23:33] <sfrisk> nitpicky sfrisk time: I almost want more margin below inputs
[14:23:47] <sfrisk> also in the inline example, more spacing between the label and the inputs
[14:24:23] <nashvail> sure
[14:24:25] <kristyjy> I think we should make sure the font for the error text is a different size than the labels as I think that might be a bit confusing
[14:24:53] <nashvail> the error text is input-label we can make that input-label-xs
[14:25:24] <nashvail> add input-label-xs *
[14:25:52] <sfrisk> error text might make sense if it was smaller, or maybe italic
[14:25:59] <sfrisk> in blends in too much with labels as it is now
[14:26:12] <nashvail> yes they are exactly the same
[14:26:22] <nashvail> so...
[14:27:43] <sfrisk> also the build is failing its tests
[14:27:50] <sfrisk> extra coma in the inputs.js styling page
[14:28:35] <nashvail> forgot to run the test like always fixing it in a sec
[14:29:44] <sfrisk> I do like the outline styling
[14:29:48] <sfrisk> testing in firefox real quick
[14:30:55] <sfrisk> are the inputs in the size example supposed to be different widths?
[14:31:06] <sfrisk> it's a bit odd their left hand size doesn't line up
[14:31:17] <sfrisk> errr right hand side*
[14:31:20] <sfrisk> I don't know sides
[14:31:29] <nashvail> in the inline ones right?
[14:31:37] <kristyjy> lol your other left :D
[14:31:41] <kristyjy> yeah
[14:32:09] <sfrisk> yes
[14:32:15] <nashvail> I am not really sure what's wrong there I think it's the tables probably?
[14:32:21] <sfrisk> also it looks like the border radius differs from xs - lg?
[14:32:24] <nashvail> because the inputs take up the whole width
[14:32:49] <sfrisk> what's that background image you're using?
[14:33:13] <nashvail> background image? where?
[14:33:27] <sfrisk> you need '    box-sizing: border-box;'
[14:33:43] <kristyjy> yeah I see the issue.. you will probably have an easier time fixing it when getting rid of the tables for layout.
[14:34:21] <nashvail> yes the tables ðŸ˜ 
[14:34:22] <sfrisk> nm, I think last pass is changing layouts again on me
[14:34:29] <sfrisk> the input needs box-sizing border-box
[14:34:33] <kristyjy> lol yeah I have the same problem :D
[14:34:45] <sfrisk> you have the width at 100% + an additional padding
[14:34:51] <sfrisk> which is making your inputs wider than the table
[14:35:26] <kristyjy> yup that's it. Putting border box on it fixes it
[14:35:30] <sfrisk> box-sizing: border-box keeps the padding calculation as part of the overall width
[14:36:14] <nashvail> Yes, but we have to still get rid of tables
[14:36:23] <kristyjy> agreed!
[14:36:24] <sfrisk> It's also why in general in your examples, there is less margin on the right hand side of the page, than left
[14:36:27] <sfrisk> correct
[14:36:56] <nashvail> I see
[14:36:58] <sfrisk> because all your inputs all the way down the page are too wide for the content
[14:37:03] <kristyjy> should we have a standard of putting border-box on everything?
[14:37:13] <sfrisk> yeah, I was actually kinda surprised it wasn't in there
[14:37:14] <kristyjy> I tend to do it globally in my projects
[14:37:31] <sfrisk> for some reason I thought that was included in normalize
[14:38:04] <sfrisk> which we should be using
[14:38:45] <kristyjy> seems like something that should be in normalize.. but maybe not everyone uses border-box for almost everything I suppose
[14:38:46] <nashvail> normalize has box-sizing:border-box for radios and checkboxes
[14:39:24] <sfrisk> ... I'm not seeing normalize in our dist files
[14:39:35] <kristyjy> oh..
[14:40:02] <nashvail> not there
[14:40:05] <kristyjy> brb need water
[14:40:30] <nashvail> isn't chassis.css compiled with normalize in it ?
[14:40:36] <sfrisk> it's supposed to be
[14:40:48] <sfrisk> but the chassis.css file doesn't seem to have any of the normalize stuff in it
[14:41:45] <nashvail> hmmm ... yes
[14:41:50] <sfrisk> might have happened during the grunt refactor
[14:41:59] <sfrisk> I'll go look into it, and talk to arschmitz
[14:42:16] <sfrisk> so sum up, everyone review the changes in input, I'll add my comments there
[14:42:22] <sfrisk> also I'll figure out what happened to normalize
[14:42:27] <sfrisk> because I thought stuff was acting oddly
[14:42:46] <sfrisk> I have to get back to work
[14:42:50] <nashvail> alright, so I'll fix the errors, remove tables
[14:42:58] <nashvail> improve the error labels
[14:43:03] <sfrisk> leave border-box box sizing stuff out for now
[14:43:11] <sfrisk> technically that should be handled with normalize
[14:43:16] <nashvail> ok got it
[14:43:22] <sfrisk> so I'll see if I can fix that first
[14:43:24] <nashvail> Should I add demos for all input sizes?
[14:43:28] <sfrisk> yes
[14:43:33] <sfrisk> it's a good way to see if something breaks
[14:43:36] <nashvail> got it
[14:43:45] <sfrisk> okay, see everyone later!
