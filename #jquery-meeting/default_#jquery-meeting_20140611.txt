[09:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you start the meeting?
[09:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, my call just ended.
[09:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz fnagel gnarf mikesherov petersendidit rxaviers
[09:02:58] <rxaviers> hello
[09:03:10] <fnagel> hello
[09:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything to discuss for download buidler?
[09:04:23] <rxaviers> Jörn has reviewed my bower PR.
[09:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry I haven't gotten to that, I'm still working through the other repos.
[09:05:01] <rxaviers> I need to make necessary adjustments to jqueryui.com. Some files are paced in new directories.
[09:05:24] <rxaviers> s/paced/placed
[09:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:54] <rxaviers> also
[09:06:00] <rxaviers> TJ has found a bug
[09:06:12] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/230
[09:06:17] <rxaviers> Minified builds of 1.11 beta contain incorrect files
[09:06:25] <rxaviers> This had to do with a bug caching the minified bundle
[09:06:31] <rxaviers> I've fixed this and deployed live.
[09:06:40] <rxaviers> That's the updates for DB for this week :D
[09:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, what's going on with Globalize?
[09:07:36] <scott_gonzalez> I just talked to DaveMethvin|away about the error handling and he's on board with what's outlined in https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/268#issuecomment-45172178
[09:07:49] <rxaviers> Cool!
[09:08:03] <rxaviers> I'm working on the Error handling. In order to have it properly handled in Globalize, I also needed to "propagate it" to cldr.js
[09:08:12] <rxaviers> So, are we good following that approach?
[09:08:22] <rxaviers> I mean, how we're handling error
[09:08:41] <rxaviers> (I need to push my updates to that branch)
[09:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> Push your updates and then I'll look at the implementation.
[09:09:07] <rxaviers> I also need to update the issue or the PR to summarize what has been done there.
[09:09:09] <rxaviers> Ok
[09:09:16] <rxaviers> I will.
[09:09:30] <rxaviers> Briefly, it validates parameters
[09:09:33] <jzaefferer> Regarding that comment: Those are properties of a plain Error instance?
[09:09:51] <rxaviers> whether they the required ones are present, and if the passed parameters have correct type.
[09:09:59] <rxaviers> Other than the parameters, it validates the loaded CLDR content.
[09:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yes, it will be an actual Error instance.
[09:10:22] <jzaefferer> So it'll also have a message that combines those properties?
[09:11:01] <rxaviers> jörn, testing the error messages on QUnit, I am testing if an Error has been thrown.
[09:11:09] <rxaviers> Is there a better way to check other properties too?
[09:11:25] <rxaviers> More specifically, I'd like to check the error.code value
[09:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> This is what I do for DEBT: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/blob/dae2b1304a0650164217952420e9e134bb42cee0/lib/field.js#L30
[09:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> And this is how I test it: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/blob/master/tests/unit/lib/field.js#L21-L24
[09:12:20] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I think right now you can't do that with assert.throws
[09:12:56] <jzaefferer> A callback for `throws` is quite nice
[09:14:26] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: doesn't help you right now, but will eventually: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/593
[09:14:41] <jzaefferer> I suggest using a custom assertion for now, with a different name but matching signature
[09:14:49] <jzaefferer> then you can switch back to `throws` later
[09:14:52] <rxaviers> aha!
[09:15:01] <rxaviers> for sure
[09:15:26] <jzaefferer> your custom assertion can be a lot simpler than this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/assert.js#L106
[09:15:53] <rxaviers> :-S
[09:16:29] <rxaviers> Any plan when 593 should get fixed and landed?
[09:17:03] <rxaviers> s/fixed/implemented (since, it wasn't a bug)
[09:17:05] <rxaviers> :)
[09:18:25] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: don't wait for it, just use a custom assertion for now
[09:18:36] <jzaefferer> though with leobalter working on QUnit, it shouldn't be far away
[09:19:06] <rxaviers> I see
[09:19:08] <rxaviers> thka
[09:19:11] <rxaviers> thks
[09:19:35] <jzaefferer> thanks?
[09:19:48] <rxaviers> yeap, for letting me know
[09:19:57] <leobalter> sure we're not far, just getting better from a cold, I'll work on that today.
[09:20:05] <jzaefferer> Anything else for Globalize?
[09:20:06] <rxaviers> \o/
[09:20:14] <jzaefferer> Otherwise fnagel, selectmenu?
[09:20:51] <rxaviers> there's one more thing for Globalize
[09:20:52] <fnagel> nothing new, perhaps I should ping Dzlan again?
[09:21:06] <fnagel> * Dylan
[09:21:26] <rxaviers> well, other than the format message that would be good having alex sexton in IRC or Skype, so we could talk. But, I guess he's on a trip right now and we couldnt talk to him.
[09:21:36] <fnagel> Regarding the width unit test issue, see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/b0e8380f023f41cb4a1bd3665177b5f0e795c289
[09:21:46] <rxaviers> there's Performance tests
[09:21:47] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/274
[09:21:59] <rxaviers> Sizzle seems to be the only project that does performance tests
[09:23:41] <rxaviers> It's hard, if not impossible, to synthesize what makes a software a great software. It may be a mixture of good interface, compatibility and quality. Some aspects are measurable, some are not. The measurable ones can be automated and used programmatically to help us achieve this goal.
[09:23:57] <rxaviers> We prevent a change or fix to break functionality or compatibility with tests via QUnit and the rest of its stack.
[09:24:03] <rxaviers> We prevent a change or fix to blow up the final size of the library by using the great rwaldron's grunt plugin `compare_size`.
[09:24:18] <rxaviers> But, how do we check whether a PR/change/fix has improved or worsen the performance of the library?
[09:24:38] <rwaldron> i take no credit for compare_size
[09:24:49] <rxaviers> ops
[09:25:18] <rxaviers> It turns out to be important having a performance suite.
[09:25:33] <rxaviers> perf test* suite
[09:26:19] <rxaviers> I would like to hear your thoughts about it, if anyone has some. :D
[09:26:29] <rxaviers> don't need to be now
[09:26:37] <rxaviers> but, we could improve https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/274
[09:26:38] <arschmitz> rxaviers: iv been working on ones for css-framework
[09:26:44] <rxaviers> and try to do that for other projects too
[09:27:30] <arschmitz> and been trying to get this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1160 working
[09:27:32] <rxaviers> arschmitz, is it somewhere?
[09:27:47] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you could run the testsuite 10 times, measure the time and define a threshold for how long that is allowed to take, that way you could catch regressions. Dunno how to account for the speed of different testing machines though
[09:27:50] <arschmitz> rxaviers: no its not working AT ALL yet lol
[09:28:10] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, it's far from the same thing.
[09:28:21] <arschmitz> rxaviers: iv yet to even get examples from different places working
[09:28:35] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the same as the sizzle testsuite?
[09:29:44] <jzaefferer> Let's discuss that later
[09:29:51] <rxaviers> yeap, ok
[09:31:00] <jzaefferer> fnagel: I just pinged tcrowley and tj on that commit, I hope one of them has an idea
[09:31:34] <fnagel> Thanks! Any idea why this is a problem with outerWidth (in unit tests only)?
[09:31:59] <jzaefferer> Do you have a link to the test code?
[09:32:12] <fnagel> Tets code?
[09:32:16] <fnagel> Just run the unit tests
[09:32:31] <fnagel> It even fails for FF30 with one pixel
[09:32:39] <jzaefferer> I mean a link to the source code of the failing test
[09:32:57] <fnagel> ahh ok
[09:32:59] <fnagel> wait
[09:33:35] <fnagel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/selectmenu/selectmenu_options.js#L101
[09:34:08] <jzaefferer> Have you tried outerWidth(true)?
[09:34:16] <fnagel> yes
[09:34:20] <fnagel> no success
[09:34:21] <jzaefferer> That's my turning it off and on again
[09:34:25] <jzaefferer> too bad
[09:34:26] <fnagel> and its padding related
[09:34:30] <fnagel> hehe
[09:34:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any ideas?
[09:35:06] <jzaefferer> After updating Firefox to 30 I ran the tests locally and I don't get a failure
[09:35:59] <fnagel> Mhh. I have 76px instead of 75
[09:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> Waiting for Firefox to update.
[09:36:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably a subpixel issue.
[09:37:13] <fnagel> In IE its more than just one px
[09:38:23] <jzaefferer> Let's get back to that later, too
[09:38:27] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: button?
[09:38:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, isn't this box sizing?
[09:38:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: no update been busy with mobile and css-framework stuff hoping to get back to it next week
[09:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14723
[09:39:49] <jzaefferer> So we set box-sizing: content-box?
[09:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> We can't do that.
[09:40:24] <jzaefferer> Why not?
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> It would change how the element is sized if the user isn't using content-box.
[09:41:10] <jzaefferer> I meant adding it to the unit testsuite
[09:41:23] <jzaefferer> Since there doesn't seem to be a problem outside of tests
[09:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I'm not sure if this is the problem.
[09:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> We're just reading the size, not setting the size, right?
[09:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, we can do that in the test.
[09:42:34] <jzaefferer> fnagel: can you give box-sizing: content-box a try?
[09:42:40] <jzaefferer> fnagel: Also, new on datepicker?
[09:42:43] <jzaefferer> *news
[09:43:38] <fnagel> I will give it a try
[09:44:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how long do you suggest we wait with 1.11 final?
[09:44:02] <fnagel> mhh no was away this weekend.
[09:44:29] <jzaefferer> but you've got a signed SFC contract now, right?
[09:44:30] <fnagel> Implementing the changes discussed in PR asap
[09:44:49] <fnagel> Yes, indeed!
[09:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be gone all next week.
[09:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> But you can do the release if you want.
[09:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, we can do it when I get back.
[09:45:34] <jzaefferer> I can do the release, but I'd rather have you around afterwards
[09:46:01] <jzaefferer> Also we still need to put some time into the changelog, at least update the release checklist for that
[09:48:00] <jzaefferer> Let's do the release when you're back
[09:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:48:10] <jzaefferer> 23rd?
[09:48:29] <jzaefferer> I can start in the morning
[09:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, though that's the board meeting.
[09:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably get it done before that starts though.
[09:49:00] <jzaefferer> Yep, starts rather later (for me)
[09:49:36] <jzaefferer> Lets look at the changelog later or tomorrow
[09:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> I figured we'd just wait till the actual release.
[09:50:49] <jzaefferer> We want to keep this structure, right? http://jqueryui.com/changelog/1.10.4/
[09:50:57] <jzaefferer> Not a flat list like this http://jqueryui.com/changelog/1.11.0-beta.2/
[09:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably start the upgrade guide though.
[09:51:13] <jzaefferer> Oh, yeah
[09:51:13] <scott_gonzalez> Those take a while to write.
[09:51:41] <jzaefferer> Let's do a jqueryui.com issue/PR for that?
[09:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:52:58] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/79
[09:53:16] <jzaefferer> I can't think of anything right now to put in there :/
[09:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/changelog/1.11.0-beta.2/ will tell us everything that needs to go in there :-)
[09:54:18] <jzaefferer> Oh yeah, renamed files and stuff :-)
[09:54:51] <jzaefferer> I think that's all
[09:55:27] <jzaefferer> Thanks everyone, keep it up :-)
