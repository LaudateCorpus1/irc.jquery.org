[07:04:30] <DaveMethvin> .
[07:17:34] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: jquery-meeting isn't your personal answering machine :P
[07:17:57] <DaveMethvin> hey who left this thing on?
[07:18:00] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:02:02] <gibson042> good day all
[09:02:26] <gnarf> hey hey
[09:03:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin timmywil rwaldron meeting time!
[09:03:20] <DaveMethvin> yey
[09:07:09] <rwaldron> Hi!
[09:07:10] <DaveMethvin> okay
[09:07:10] <DaveMethvin> sorry about the confusion
[09:07:10] <DaveMethvin> (mine)
[09:07:10] <DaveMethvin> i did get the agenda updated
[09:07:10] <rworth> hey
[09:08:25] * gnarf is updated via the agenda
[09:09:40] <DaveMethvin> hey so i asked rworth to join us b/c they need some help getting the new sites like plugins and api up and running
[09:09:40] <DaveMethvin> so i figured, where can i find some smart people
[09:09:40] <DaveMethvin> do you guys know? :P
[09:09:40] <DaveMethvin> rworth: what needs to be done so we can launch these by the end of the month?
[09:09:41] <jzaefferer> the agenda that says May 21 twice?
[09:09:42] <rworth> the api site is in pretty decent shape
[09:09:42] <rworth> all the xml is in the new api.jquery.com repo
[09:09:42] <DaveMethvin> any specific tasks we could help you with?
[09:09:43] <rworth> and it publishes to a local or remote WordPress site via grunt-wordpress
[09:09:43] <rworth> we're trying to make it easier for people to get up and running
[09:09:43] <DaveMethvin> my advice: DON'T use Windows :P
[09:09:43] <rworth> :)
[09:09:43] <rworth> yeah, it's not too bad otherwise. But right now it's fairly easy for someone to help with 1 or 2 sites
[09:09:43] <DaveMethvin> what kind of help do you need?
[09:09:43] <rworth> but not as easy as it should be to help with 10-20 sites
[09:10:35] <DaveMethvin> it's later than i thought
[09:11:20] <gnarf> so - as far as infra goes, moving to the new sites - we are pretty close, a couple of small configs for the front end proxies and things should be ready
[09:11:37] <gnarf> need to get w/ danheberden some time hopefully this week and hash out whatever remaining details we can
[09:14:49] <gnarf> the staging server for the WP stuff seems to be handling whatever scott_gonzalez and rworth are doing with it
[09:14:49] <gnarf> and they haven't complained yet
[09:14:49] <gnarf> so i assume its working? :)
[09:18:47] <danheberden> and that's on a relataively small box
[09:18:52] <gnarf> as far as "help with infra" goes - anyone who's interested in being a sysadmin should talk to danheberden or I -- help on the WP/XML/Site Content stuff should prolly talk to rworth or scott_gonzalez
[09:18:53] <gnarf> did I lose IRC again, or are you guys just being quiet like mice?
[09:18:53] * gnarf sets out some cheese
[09:18:54] <gibson042> I just had a flood of messages all catch up at once, so maybe both?
[09:18:54] <danheberden> i think the interweb is dying
[09:18:54] <gnarf> gibson042: IRC has been like "bursty" for me today
[09:18:54] <gnarf> I'm just waiting for the netsplit
[09:21:08] <gnarf> ...
[09:27:34] <gnarf> there it is!
[09:27:35] <danheberden> kaplow!
[09:27:35] <gibson042> cue Twilight Zone music
[09:27:35] <gnarf> bet you there is still another coming
[09:27:36] <gnarf> so um
[09:27:36] * danheberden looks to the east
[09:27:36] <gnarf> no dave
[09:27:36] <gnarf> is there anything on the agenda we can cover until he gets back?
[09:27:36] <gnarf> Manual modularity ?
[09:27:36] <gnarf> gibson042: ?
[09:27:37] <gibson042> it's in and looking good, but I know rwaldron wants to land IIFE-unwrapping before we get too much farther
[09:27:37] <gnarf> I agree with that
[09:27:38] <gnarf> it would be nice to have a private area for all our utility funcs
[09:27:38] <gnarf> that are cross module
[09:27:38] <gnarf> that can be shared without making them functions on the prototype
[09:27:38] <rwaldron> It's true, I do.
[09:27:38] <rwaldron> But there is another thing I wanted to address
[09:27:39] <gnarf> yes?
[09:27:39] <rwaldron> The strip_iife branch is ready to be merged if everyone else is ready to accept it as the "the way forward"
[09:27:46] <rwaldron> There's a catch
[09:27:59] <rwaldron> line numbers in errors are for the built code
[09:28:09] <rwaldron> not the src/files.js
[09:28:19] <gnarf> yeah - i always hate that
[09:28:20] <rwaldron> do we make that sacrifice?
[09:28:58] <gnarf> IMO - the benifits to the built source make it worth the sacrifice
[09:29:00] <rwaldron> Same here
[09:30:47] <rwaldron> gnarf it's creepy how much you and I share a brain sometimes
[09:30:48] <gnarf> "We seem to think that the benifits outway the debugging/development minor hassle"
[09:31:08] <gibson042> the only recommendation I have is prefixing shared variables so that it's obvious where they're defined
[09:31:08] <rwaldron> i was _literally_ placing the cursor to copy/paste the above notes about line numbers
[09:31:10] <gnarf> heh
[09:31:22] <rwaldron> gibson042 I'm going to leave that to you
[09:31:29] <gnarf> dave.methvin: rwaldron: can we land strip_iife soon?
[09:31:38] <rwaldron> please do it tastefully.
[09:31:38] <gnarf> (from google doc)
[09:31:41] <gnarf> yay!
[09:34:27] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[09:34:28] <rwaldron> what the hell is going on?
[09:34:31] <gnarf> net splits....
[09:34:33] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:34:33] <DaveMethvin> as i was saying ...
[09:34:33] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:34:33] <gibson042> I give it a green light for committing to master now; I can sweep over renames later if no one else hits it
[09:34:33] <mikesherov> OH HAI?!
[09:34:33] <gnarf> https://raw.github.com/gist/3cfbb157c4f24b19e7fa/a463da1450d916b3520e5ee6c5605f2cb35bdda8/gistfile1.txt
[09:34:33] <gnarf> for those of you that rode the network down
[09:34:33] <gnarf> thats what we said
[09:34:33] <gnarf> damnit
[09:34:33] <gnarf> we just lost them again
[09:34:33] <mikesherov> I must've entered a black hole
[09:34:34] <DaveMethvin> so anyone up for a bug triage meeting?
[09:34:34] <gnarf> oh wait
[09:34:34] <gnarf> we didnt
[09:34:34] * gnarf is confused
[09:34:34] <gnarf> bug triage - yes I'm up for it
[09:34:34] <gnarf> after monday meeting would be best for me
[09:34:34] <gnarf> that or wed / fri
[09:34:34] <gnarf> those are already jquery meeting days
[09:34:38] <gnarf> does anyone else have a moment to look into those effects failures in IE?
[09:34:49] <gnarf> I'm over in this magical land of building servers
[09:34:53] <gibson042> I could do another evening one, or wed-fri during the day
[09:35:01] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin gnarf +1 to bug triage
[09:35:36] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you think we can beta for the conf?
[09:35:42] <mikesherov> YES
[09:35:42] <mikesherov> right now?
[09:35:42] <DaveMethvin> well i have a feeling it's just you and me again
[09:35:42] <mikesherov> shit
[09:35:42] <mikesherov> back to gogole doc
[09:35:42] <DaveMethvin> they're just doing this to get out of bug triage!
[09:36:07] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[09:36:16] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we were seeing you
[09:36:19] <gnarf> but like you weren't here

[09:36:36] <gnarf> MOVING MEETING TO GOOGLE DOCUMENTS CHAT AREA
[09:36:43] <gnarf> PLEASE FOLLOW - AT LEAST ITS STABLE
[09:37:06] <gibson042> I can't triage right now
[09:37:25] <gnarf> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4
[09:45:51] <gnarf> hrm

[09:48:01] <DaveMethvin> so it
[09:48:03] <gnarf> strip_iife - do it ---- do it now!
[09:48:04] <DaveMethvin> do
[09:48:07] <gnarf> get to da choppa!
[09:48:08] <rwaldron> ok
[09:48:12] <rwaldron> incoming...
[09:48:38] * rwaldron *ducks*
[09:49:26] <rwaldron> oh yeah.. I forgot about some of the neat stuff I added
[09:49:54] <rwaldron> grunt dist:/Users/you/Dropbox/Public/   <-- will move your built files there
[09:50:10] <DaveMethvin> awesome!
[09:50:21] <rwaldron> also...
[09:50:22] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Makefile
[09:50:39] <rwaldron> BUT
[09:50:49] <rwaldron> "grunt submodules" does all that
[09:51:02] <rwaldron> I needed help with git-intense task authoring
[09:51:08] <rwaldron> so, for now it's all that remains
[09:51:15] <rwaldron> also, build/ has to be dumped
[09:51:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah we need to keep/move the release.js script tho
[09:51:43] <rwaldron> right
[09:52:05] <rwaldron> actually... yes...that's why i haven't rm'ed the build/ dir
[09:52:09] <rwaldron> thanks for the reminder
[09:52:18] <DaveMethvin> lol, yeah if we ever want to release
[09:52:19] <rwaldron> some things can be cleaned up
[09:52:21] <rwaldron> give me a moment
[09:52:26] <DaveMethvin> although most of that can be done manually
[09:52:36] <DaveMethvin> it could be a grunt task in fact
[09:54:05] <rwaldron> yes, agreed
[09:54:13] <rwaldron> all the things should be
[09:54:25] <rwaldron> ok, pushed some cleanup
[09:54:32] <rwaldron> build is pretty empty now
[09:54:37] <rwaldron> just the release stuff in there
[09:54:44] <rwaldron> next: we should get source maps
[09:55:07] <DaveMethvin> oh you guys are so soft, just read the combo file :D
[09:56:32] <rwaldron> Ok, just pushed a little tweak to the readme
[10:03:55] <DaveMethvin> testing 1233
[10:04:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin 1233
[10:04:29] <DaveMethvin> too late rwaldron we're back over here! :D
