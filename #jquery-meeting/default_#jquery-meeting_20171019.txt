[14:05:57] <arschmitz> apsdehal: hi
[14:06:11] <apsdehal> Hey
[14:06:46] <arschmitz> sorry iv just been swamped the last couple weeks
[14:07:12] <apsdehal> Hmm, I have been trying to catch for last couple weeks lol
[14:07:23] <apsdehal> *catch you
[14:08:09] <apsdehal> Any progress with blog post?
[14:10:54] <arschmitz> its about done
[14:11:06] <apsdehal> Cool
[14:11:07] <arschmitz> i just keep getting pulled away every time i try to finish it
[14:11:21] <arschmitz> ill be gone the next week
[14:11:25] <apsdehal> Also, in UI, do you guys have any tags for beginner issues?
[14:11:34] <arschmitz> hoping things settle down after that
[14:11:44] <apsdehal> Ok
[14:11:53] <arschmitz> we dont but i can make one and give you access to add issues
[14:12:12] <apsdehal> Yes, because we would need that for newcomers
[14:12:23] <apsdehal> And a new medium for communication
[14:12:31] <apsdehal> Probably slack or something else
[14:13:45] <arschmitz> want to set up a slack channel?
[14:14:57] <apsdehal> Yes, was thinking about that
[14:15:05] <apsdehal> You can probably mention that in your blog post
[14:16:21] <apsdehal> Hey, cogwurx
[14:16:52] <cogwurx> oh hey!
[14:16:56] <cogwurx> long time!
[14:17:00] <apsdehal> arschmitz: I will setup the channel then
[14:17:01] <apsdehal> Yes
[14:17:04] <apsdehal> long time
[14:17:20] <apsdehal> We were talking about setting up a slack channel to easily connect
[14:17:53] <cogwurx> you are? Nice. have you guys been meeting?
[14:18:12] <apsdehal> No, we are just discussing about that, we have some new contributors coming in
[14:18:28] <apsdehal> So, it is probably better to move from irc to something more accessible
[14:18:39] <cogwurx> cool!
[14:19:06] <apsdehal> arschmitz: will release a new blog post about UI and Mobile team being one soon and will include link to slack channel there
[14:19:17] <apsdehal> I hope to see increased activity after that
[14:20:18] <arschmitz> indeed
[14:21:09] <apsdehal> Setting slack name to jquery-ui-and-mobile
[14:21:19] <apsdehal> or jqueryui-dev
[14:21:22] <cogwurx> YAY! every week I come here and it's me and the crickets...
[14:21:28] <apsdehal> Lol
[14:21:39] <apsdehal> I am here most of the time, but the channel is on mute
[14:22:03] <cogwurx> noticed :-]
[14:22:06] <arschmitz> um just jqueryui-dev is think is good
[14:22:12] <apsdehal> Yes
[14:36:46] <bcochran> Regarding jqueryui-dev, perhaps you might want to get 'rwd' in there.  I assume that the two frameworks will come together to provide a best-in-class responsive web design framework?
[14:48:54] <apsdehal> For now, we have this link for joining: https://join.slack.com/t/jqueryui-dev/shared_invite/enQtMjU4MzcwMDYyMDAwLTllMTc3Njg5ZjQxMjVjY2RmNzU0YWQyYjUwOTcwOTBiMjRhMzdhY2U0MmRlNWNkNzQ1NGYzNTczY2ZlYjBiYmM
[14:49:11] <apsdehal> Will expire in 30 days, but I will setup slackin for permanent invite kind of thing
[14:58:42] <bcochran> fyi: worked for me
[15:15:22] <apsdehal> arschmitz: https://communityinviter.com/apps/jqueryui-dev/jquery-ui-and-mobile-dev
[15:15:28] <apsdehal> This is general link you can use
[15:27:18] <cogwurx> nice..I'm in slack now
[15:29:28] <jimmich> I signed in on slack as well
[15:32:50] <apsdehal> Thanks guys, setting up github integrations would be next, will do it soon.
[15:36:44] <cogwurx> will all our discussions be in #general or will there be separate channels for projects and such
[15:37:43] <apsdehal> I think general should be good
[15:37:51] <apsdehal> Until we have a lot of discussion
[15:38:38] <cgack_> maybe a #meetings channel
[15:38:45] <cgack_> ?
[15:40:35] <apsdehal> That can be done, for specific weekly meetings
[15:41:08] <apsdehal> For rest general inquiries, question and discussions, #general should be good I guess
[15:53:23] <cogwurx> so weekly meetings now in slack or should we check here still? asking since I'm heading out in a few
[15:57:57] <cgack_> I'd say we should fully migrate to slack if we plan to use it at all
