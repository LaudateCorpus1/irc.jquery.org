[09:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:01:55] <jzaefferer> Ello
[09:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Got any news on the infrastructure side?
[09:04:02] <danheberden> oh hai!
[09:04:23] <danheberden> i'm trying to get the puppet config stuff (writing manifests is new, so struggling a bit) going
[09:04:43] <danheberden> but as for setting up servers, i have a single bash script in a gist that installs puppet client and configures it
[09:04:59] <jzaefferer> "in a gist"
[09:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> You should probably move that to the infrastructure repo
[09:05:10] <jzaefferer> Still better then "on Scott's hard drive"
[09:05:20] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez the repo is private
[09:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> We should create a scripts directory. So you can curl the files onto the servers.
[09:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a problem with the script being private?
[09:05:53] <danheberden> the goal is to sh -c "$(wget -q -O - 'https://raw.gist...')"
[09:06:00] <danheberden> which is how it works now
[09:06:05] <danheberden> because there is no git on the server
[09:06:14] <danheberden> that sets up puppet from a fresh install of debian
[09:06:26] <danheberden> then, once setup, puppet installs nginx, git, users, blah blah blah
[09:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> Can we get a infrastructure-public repo? :-)
[09:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather have a repo than a gist for scripts as important as deploying a new server.
[09:07:19] <danheberden> maybe
[09:07:32] <jzaefferer> yeah, shouldn't be bound to a single person
[09:07:37] <danheberden> i'd rather not bury in some fine detail like this
[09:07:51] <danheberden> it's there, it's clonable, findable
[09:07:58] <danheberden> so i'd rather get the servers, like, working 'n shit
[09:08:08] <danheberden> than worry about iterating over details of where that one script lives
[09:08:50] <danheberden> anyway, it's going well - trying to get boxes running with nginx/users/etc today for our launch tomorrow
[09:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf, clarkbox: Any update on stability of tests?
[09:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> guess not
[09:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Update on grunt build.
[09:14:41] <jzaefferer> Making good progress on both replicating the existing build and improving things
[09:15:18] <jzaefferer> Grunt is somewhat rough around the edges, like the concat task not supporting <banner> directives, but I've set up npm link to work on grunt as well
[09:15:34] <jzaefferer> So as long as Ben is willing to accept my pull requests, I can fix those issues on the go
[09:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:15:57] <jzaefferer> Want to finish the whole thing this week, including theme downloads and CDN files
[09:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> You also got the zip task working, correct?
[09:16:10] <jzaefferer> zip is working, yeah
[09:16:15] <jzaefferer> switched to a more stable lib
[09:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> Great. Maybe we'll be able to use it for 1.8.19.
[09:16:56] <jzaefferer> so far I have just added package.json and grunt.js, so should be easy to merge to 1-8-stable
[09:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to QUnit update.
[09:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> We landed the fix in QUnit and pulled that into UI.
[09:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> I updated the selectmenu branch too.
[09:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> I can go through and update all of the other branches this week.
[09:19:45] <jzaefferer> Also landed a bunch of improvements in QUnit today, planning to tag 1.4.0 on Friday and pull that in again
[09:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll wait for that then.
[09:20:28] <jzaefferer> Shouldn't change anything outside of the qunit files this time
[09:21:24] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer also finished the .data() naming in all files that aren't being rewritten.
[09:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> Richard isn't here to talk about docs. Does anyone else have a docs update?
[09:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> I did another code review of accordion.
[09:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> There are some TODOs in the code now, if anyone wants to take a look.
[09:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> All just internal cleanup stuff.
[09:24:19] <jzaefferer> Hadn't seen those yet
[09:25:05] <jzaefferer> I'm seeing only this one:
[09:25:14] <jzaefferer> > // TODO assert that the blur and focus triggers are really necessary, remove otherwise
[09:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[09:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder what I did
[09:28:23] <jzaefferer> Yeah, me too
[09:29:14] * scott_gonzalez is confused
[09:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> Wow. I never pushed.
[09:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> From 5 days ago :-(
[09:31:15] * scott_gonzalez is rebasing...
[09:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/374661a2ffaaef93f2b679826bc69c0b214b5310
[09:31:43] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (5d, 5h ago): Accordion: Code review.
[09:35:03] <jzaefferer> haha
[09:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything on the agenda.
[09:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:35:35] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, then we're done for today.
[09:38:25] <jzaefferer> thanks danheberden for not leaving Scott and me all by ourselves :-)
[09:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> To fully express our thanks, I shall now mute so you cannot respond.
