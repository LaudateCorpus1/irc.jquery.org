[11:07:02] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: hey - bug ajpiano to name another person on your team with a +o here ;)
[11:07:15] <agcolom> Thanks!
[11:07:29] <toddmparker> ajpiano: mind unmoderating -meeting?
[11:07:32] <gnarf> actually, i should just bug ajpiano to give me +F on the irc channels so I can do that myself ;)
[11:08:00] <gnarf> toddmparker: "toddparker" has a +o with chanserv
[11:08:06] <ajpiano> toddmparker: this is -meeting and it's unmoderated :p
[11:08:10] <gnarf> can you /msg chanserv op #jquery-meeting ? :)
[11:08:11] <ajpiano> and also that ^^
[11:08:36] <toddmparker> actually, seems unmoderated now
[11:08:48] <toddmparker> chime in if you're here
[11:08:53] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:08:54] <gseguin> hi
[11:09:02] <RWhitbeck> chiming
[11:09:14] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:09:17] <_|Nix|_> Hey, alL!
[11:09:24] <johnbender> here
[11:10:04] <AlexSchmitz> here
[11:10:08] <toddmparker> go team!
[11:10:10] <gnarf> I nominate johnbender and gseguin to have +o in -meeting so I don't have to unmute the channel next time ;)
[11:10:25] <RWhitbeck> gnarf I am willing as well.
[11:10:34] <toddmparker> i usually can but i'm messed up a bit in irc
[11:10:45] <gseguin> sure
[11:10:47] <toddmparker> might as well give other the powers
[11:10:48] <johnbender> yah I though toddmparker had op
[11:10:50] <gnarf> toddmparker: never hurts to have an extra person on the access list tho ;)
[11:10:52] <toddmparker> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igqAXG0b7fA7sHP89sCsooJNs4QF1IjrTUWuoajU8JI/edit#
[11:13:12] <ajpiano> gnarf: you have +F here now, gseguin you have +o on chanserv here as well
[11:13:25] <ajpiano> johnbender: isn't authed with nickserv so i don't know what account to add
[11:13:28] <gnarf> ajpiano: thanks :)
[11:13:39] <gseguin> thanks ajpiano
[11:13:54] <toddmparker> thanks
[11:14:06] <toddmparker> Good progress on 1.3 features
[11:14:19] <gnarf> just gave ryanneufeld +o as well - so there's one more
[11:15:02] <toddmparker> tabes are pretty close feature wise, working on writing up docs and demos
[11:15:10] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html
[11:15:55] <johnbender> ajpiano: ugh, long story
[11:16:00] <johnbender> ajpiano: don't worry about it
[11:16:13] <toddmparker> script is set up as a table.js script that has some core utils
[11:16:35] <toddmparker> and the two modes: reflow (Stack) and column chooser are each extensions to that
[11:16:54] <toddmparker> how to structure docs for that
[11:17:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: you might want to add a "This is not a grid widget!" section at the top :D
[11:17:58] <toddmparker> but we can discuss offline
[11:18:05] <toddmparker> johnbender: ha!
[11:18:42] <toddmparker> but please do look at this and post q's to the issue
[11:19:16] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5093
[11:19:57] <gseguin> great work guys!
[11:20:03] <uGoMobi> really cool widget, nice work!
[11:20:10] <toddmparker> thanks
[11:20:23] <toddmparker> docs are still messy but it all mostly there
[11:20:28] <AlexSchmitz> im a big fan already have places i plan to use!
[11:20:34] <toddmparker> like that we kept this pretty light
[11:20:37] <toddmparker> cool
[11:20:44] <toddmparker> New API site and demos to replace current demos & docs - need to discuss a plan and timing - can we hit this for 1.3?
[11:21:16] <uGoMobi> I think we can
[11:21:26] <agcolom> Waht s the timescale for 1.3?
[11:21:40] <toddmparker> i want to avoid having duplicate places for too long
[11:21:49] <toddmparker> end of the year-ish
[11:21:50] <uGoMobi> I agree
[11:22:04] <toddmparker> realistically
[11:22:06] <agcolom> Ok, should be fine
[11:22:32] <toddmparker> agcolom has a lis tof things left to doc
[11:22:45] <toddmparker> Can we package the AJAX anv model more cleanly so it’s not part of core and just a plugin?
[11:22:54] <toddmparker> that is part of the task
[11:23:06] <toddmparker> our core.js has a lot of nav settings
[11:23:19] <johnbender> yes!
[11:23:23] <toddmparker> be nice to figure out how to organize and document nav better
[11:23:29] <johnbender> zomg
[11:23:32] <toddmparker> i'd love to have johnbender working with agcolom on this
[11:23:34] <toddmparker> think it
[11:23:36] <johnbender> $.mobile is so crowded
[11:23:37] <toddmparker> s really important
[11:24:04] <toddmparker> and I think she needs help understand this stuff so it can be documented
[11:24:23] <johnbender> toddmparker: hopefully by the end of integrating this bit I built I can start down that path
[11:24:37] <toddmparker> that would be great
[11:24:51] <toddmparker> when do you think you'd be able to look at this?
[11:25:12] <johnbender> I'm working my way through the tests
[11:25:20] <johnbender> getting them passing has been ... difficult
[11:25:29] <johnbender> i'm about half way there I would say
[11:25:41] <johnbender> after about a week of work
[11:26:12] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[11:27:13] <toddmparker> that's it for me…johnbender
[11:27:25] <johnbender> I just summed it up entirely
[11:27:29] <johnbender> I've spent the last week
[11:27:32] <johnbender> the entire week
[11:27:48] <johnbender> burried in trying to get existing nav working with the new stuff I built
[11:27:53] <toddmparker> fun.
[11:27:59] <johnbender> yah it's been a slog
[11:28:04] <johnbender> but the results are pleasing
[11:28:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hang in there!
[11:28:09] <toddmparker> good
[11:28:38] <toddmparker> who wants to hop in?
[11:28:43] <_|Nix|_> I can ...
[11:29:01] <toddmparker> k
[11:29:29] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I'm working on two things, which both need merging: the controlgroup thing and the moving options to defaults thing.
[11:30:00] <_|Nix|_> Then, I need to know whether I should cherry-pick two fixes into 1.2-stable and even 1.1-stable ...
[11:30:29] <_|Nix|_> The fix for 4317 implements on-the-fly options for the button widget using the reusable buttonMarkup.
[11:30:34] <toddmparker> on the latter Q, I wouldn't pick these back because they could cause ripples
[11:30:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. Great.
[11:30:54] <toddmparker> so this would be for 1.3
[11:30:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, the fix will be out in 1.3.
[11:30:59] <toddmparker> yep
[11:31:17] <_|Nix|_> Then I need to start working on unit tests for some of the bug fixes I've made.
[11:31:17] <toddmparker> i saw you made the change to use either border radius which is good
[11:31:34] <toddmparker> does that mean that things now look the same as they currently do across all widgets?
[11:31:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, and I've been hunting for places in the code where instead of adding corner classes by hand, we can add them using a call to buttonMarkup.
[11:31:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[11:31:57] <toddmparker> great
[11:32:24] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, if something was created using buttonMarkup, it should be modified using buttonMarkup and it will be consistent.
[11:32:39] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: are you looking at that PR?
[11:32:41] <_|Nix|_> Of course, listviews might be an exception for performance reasons.
[11:32:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just a quick note, this applies to everyone, it's probably better to write the tests right after or before your bugfix
[11:32:54] <uGoMobi> I have been looking at it yes
[11:33:00] <toddmparker> ok
[11:33:02] <johnbender> it's hard to write comprehensive tests when you have to go back and remember what you did
[11:33:10] <toddmparker> johnbender: true
[11:33:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know ... one thing lead to another ... and here I am, behind on tests :-S
[11:33:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and making excuses about it :)
[11:33:48] <johnbender> no worries, more of PSA
[11:33:49] <toddmparker> re: on-the-fly options, I didn't think that was on deck for 1.3
[11:34:00] <johnbender> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: I was about toask
[11:34:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's only for the button, because it fixes an issue.
[11:34:08] <johnbender> let me check the issue
[11:34:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I agreed with johnbender that we shall implement on-the-fly options only as people need them.
[11:34:36] <_|Nix|_> #4661 IIRC.
[11:34:47] <_|Nix|_> No, sorry. #4317
[11:35:00] <johnbender> I still don't think we need to support alteration of the data attributes
[11:35:24] <johnbender> also, that's really a feature and not bug
[11:35:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, the only alternative then is to remove the whole widget and create a new one with the new atributes.
[11:35:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That in turn may cause the page to jerk.
[11:35:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: does uGoMobi's approach not work?
[11:36:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... which is ...?
[11:36:17] <johnbender> third comment down: .buttonMarkup({ theme: a }).button('refresh');
[11:36:53] <johnbender> calling buttonMarkup directly and then refresh from button is ugly, but I'd rather fix the api shape than start supporint data attribute watching/manip
[11:37:10] <johnbender> maintaining state between the markup and widget is _extremely_ complex
[11:38:00] <uGoMobi> that approach won't work for buttons that don't use the button widget
[11:38:04] <toddmparker> Another factor is we're doing a lot of soul searching on theming and markup/styles right now so I'd prefer to wait and see how that shakes out before adding more to these js-based class options
[11:38:19] <uGoMobi> like anchors with data-role="button"
[11:38:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: can we fix that?
[11:38:46] <_|Nix|_> The way I've implemented this is that it does call .buttonMarkup(), but it does so while implementing the widget factory's _setOption interface.
[11:39:02] <_|Nix|_> All calls to _setOption() are being passed through to .buttonMarkup() ...
[11:39:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: uGoMobi lets continue this in dev after the meeting
[11:39:24] <uGoMobi> I think simple solution is remove the initSelector from buttonMarkup and make them use button widget as well
[11:39:30] <toddmparker> for example, we use a lot of JS to add classes and decorate markup which could be avoided if we re-think our approach
[11:39:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok good idea
[11:40:06] <toddmparker> agreed, offline conversation
[11:40:27] <_|Nix|_> So, then there's the corners thing ...
[11:40:28] <toddmparker> ok, so uGoMobi is looking at the PR (thanks _|Nix|_)
[11:40:41] <toddmparker> yeah, that is being looked at
[11:40:43] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[11:40:51] <_|Nix|_> That's it from Finland.
[11:40:55] <toddmparker> thanks!
[11:41:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi?
[11:41:05] <uGoMobi> k
[11:41:16] <uGoMobi> worked on reorganizing and cleaning up docs & demos files to make them ready for restyling and moving parts to new API documentation
[11:41:16] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-docs/
[11:41:40] <uGoMobi> but we have to discuss how we plan this
[11:42:03] <uGoMobi> like you already said
[11:42:25] <uGoMobi> we can take that offline too
[11:42:50] <uGoMobi> created a “view source code” solution (have to clean up and tweak the syntax highlighting stuff)
[11:42:50] <uGoMobi> example:http://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-docs/docs/demos/popup-panel/index.html
[11:43:08] <uGoMobi> convention: wrap markup in <div data-demo-html="true">
[11:43:08] <uGoMobi> add data-demo-js="true" data-demo-css="true" to grab script/style from the head
[11:43:14] <RWhitbeck> UGoMobi FYI, this http://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-docs/ never loads just spins.
[11:43:34] <agcolom> nice! (view source)
[11:43:54] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: thanks
[11:43:59] <uGoMobi> will check that out
[11:44:00] <toddmparker> very cool
[11:44:08] <RWhitbeck> +1
[11:44:16] <uGoMobi> caused by the syntax highlighter I just added
[11:44:17] <agcolom> Could we add rounded corners?
[11:44:21] <uGoMobi> no
[11:44:27] <uGoMobi> ;-)
[11:44:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Shorter even <div data-demo-html>, right? No need for ="true" with boolean attributes.
[11:44:33] <AlexSchmitz> The view source looks very nice
[11:44:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looks cool!
[11:44:48] <toddmparker> pleeze
[11:45:02] <agcolom> yes... please :-)
[11:45:25] <toddmparker> wow, awesome work on that view source
[11:45:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I fear I'm going to prick my finger on the corners otherwise :)
[11:45:30] <toddmparker> looks slick
[11:45:45] <uGoMobi> ok ok... rounded corners it is
[11:45:58] <toddmparker> why does it disappear then reappear when you switch sections?
[11:45:59] <johnbender> I just get the spinner :(
[11:46:13] <gseguin> same here
[11:46:15] <johnbender> SyntaxHighlighter isn't defined
[11:46:15] <agcolom> and the text goes out of the popup (when too long)
[11:46:19] <uGoMobi> have to clean up all that syntax highlight stuff... move it to one file and make sure the code wraps
[11:46:48] <gseguin> oh very nice
[11:46:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that is because I trigger resize on the popup
[11:46:56] <toddmparker> i see
[11:47:05] <toddmparker> great start
[11:47:24] <uGoMobi> that is to center the popup on the screen again
[11:47:28] <toddmparker> this is great
[11:48:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Since the target audience for this will be using desktops, I think we can do some fancy .animate()-based resizing ... but that's not essential right now.
[11:48:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I know the text is not wrapping... have to clean up the CSS
[11:48:28] <toddmparker> sure
[11:48:46] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok :-) but I like the way the html/css/js are separated!
[11:48:55] <uGoMobi> I just wanted to make sure we can make it work like this so we have a convention and can start making demo pages
[11:49:10] <toddmparker> so my suggestion was to just add a /demos/ folder next to /docs/ in master and start building that out in parallel instead of using a branch. that seem ok?
[11:49:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: as temporary solution?
[11:50:05] <uGoMobi> so we can work on demos on master?
[11:51:10] <toddmparker> well, once we cut over to the API docs, we can delete /docs/ and just have /demos/
[11:51:27] <agcolom> sounds good...
[11:52:11] <toddmparker> just be easier to know you're setting latest instead of keeping a branch alive
[11:52:18] <uGoMobi> right now "Docs" on jquerymobile.com links to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/
[11:52:37] <gnarf> out of curiosity, do you guys plan on versioning your api docs?
[11:52:40] <toddmparker> right, we'd re-wire this for 1.3 to point to /demos/
[11:52:40] <uGoMobi> title is demos & documentation
[11:53:08] <gnarf> like will there be an http://api.jquerymobile.com/1.2 when 1.3 comes out/
[11:53:10] <uGoMobi> we have to make sure it is not going to be too confusing :)
[11:53:20] <toddmparker> agreed
[11:53:38] <toddmparker> but i want to make the demo landing page very different right now
[11:53:40] <uGoMobi> ok I make a folder demos
[11:53:50] <_|Nix|_> I guess finalizing the API docs should be part of the release process ...
[11:55:24] <toddmparker> if that has an assets folder inside with demo-related css and scripts like your view source, that would be a good start
[11:55:34] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: that's what i'm thinking
[11:55:49] <toddmparker> 1.3 could have new api docs, new demos
[11:55:58] <toddmparker> maybe a new site
[11:56:01] <uGoMobi> yes I will include _assets with view source stuff and a empty demo template
[11:56:42] <uGoMobi> BTW - problem with http://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-docs/ is that I only added links to syntaxhighlighter JS on the demo pages
[11:56:47] <toddmparker> the longer we use the current docs, the more confusing it is
[11:56:47] <toddmparker> cool
[11:56:48] <uGoMobi> will fix that after meeting
[11:57:03] <toddmparker> if you had an index page, folder and a sample page then we can start cranking
[11:57:25] <toddmparker> that may be ok
[11:57:26] <uGoMobi> I have those so I move that to a new folder /demos on branch master
[11:57:30] <toddmparker> since that is all we'll have
[11:58:17] <toddmparker> for now, we could just have a long index page with a list of demos grouped by categories
[11:58:33] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:58:57] <toddmparker> nice
[11:59:05] <toddmparker> can't wait to start adding pages
[11:59:15] <uGoMobi> yeah me too :)
[11:59:21] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[11:59:25] <agcolom> Looking really good!
[11:59:40] <uGoMobi> ah... triage.... we were below 300 :)
[11:59:46] <toddmparker> dang it
[12:00:11] <toddmparker> ok, let's zoom thru the last updates
[12:00:15] <toddmparker> agcolom?
[12:00:17] <agcolom> yes
[12:00:19] <agcolom>     15 new resources on the resources page
[12:00:19] <agcolom>     Experienced with automatically generated examples in the API docs and discovered issues there (Buttons vs buttonMarkup)
[12:00:19] <agcolom>     Proof reading of new table docs
[12:00:19] <agcolom>     minor corrections to existing docs and api docs
[12:00:19] <agcolom>     We need a list of what else needs to be documented (via issues on https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/)
[12:01:08] <agcolom> On the resources page, I've noticed that one of the link we were given was a demo (Formula1)
[12:01:19] <toddmparker> your updates:
[12:01:20] <toddmparker> 15 new resources on the resources page
[12:01:21] <toddmparker> Experienced with automatically generated examples in the API docs and discovered issues there (Buttons vs buttonMarkup)
[12:01:22] <toddmparker> Proof reading of new table docs
[12:01:23] <toddmparker> minor corrections to existing docs and api docs
[12:01:24] <toddmparker> We need a list of what else needs to be documented (via issues on https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/)
[12:01:44] <toddmparker> looks like focusing on finishing up the api docs, esp nav is a priority
[12:01:51] <agcolom> Should we add a new category in the articles on the resources page for demos or do we not link demos?
[12:01:59] <toddmparker> did anyone from the summit stay around?
[12:02:07] <AlexSchmitz> im here
[12:02:07] <toddmparker> might be worth trying to get some help
[12:02:16] <agcolom> not recently
[12:02:21] <agcolom> (from my table)
[12:02:30] <toddmparker> agcolom: no demos
[12:02:34] <AlexSchmitz> realized right after i said that ha ha
[12:02:50] <toddmparker> i meant from the docs table :)
[12:02:51] <agcolom> yes, I need someone to go through what is there to check what I've written....
[12:02:57] <agcolom> (api docs)
[12:03:10] <agcolom> also, do we go by widget name or by common name?
[12:03:17] <toddmparker> ok
[12:03:32] <toddmparker> let me know if you need our help reviewing
[12:03:35] <agcolom> for example, as I have followed the existing docs, I have used common names
[12:03:50] <agcolom> should I change that to use widget names?
[12:03:51] <toddmparker> we also need to add 1.3 features to that like table
[12:03:56] <agcolom> yes
[12:04:12] <agcolom> Also, I think I've documented as widgets things that are not widgets
[12:04:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I opened a ticket for that
[12:04:32] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/82
[12:04:43] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thx!
[12:04:48] <agcolom> for example here http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/category/widgets/
[12:05:05] <toddmparker> thanks agcolom
[12:05:06] <toddmparker> hey AlexSchmitz
[12:05:14] <toddmparker> great job on triage with uGoMobi
[12:05:21] <AlexSchmitz> Thank you
[12:05:48] <agcolom> Initially, I was thinking that common names were good, as easier for people to find... so should I change that to the exact widget name?
[12:05:57] <AlexSchmitz> Doing what i can
[12:06:23] <toddmparker> agcolom: I think we should follow what ui does
[12:06:46] <toddmparker> http://api.jqueryui.com/category/widgets/
[12:06:50] <agcolom> ok, I'll wait for Scott's reply on that
[12:06:55] <toddmparker> they seem to use common names
[12:07:11] <toddmparker> i think we should just document like things together
[12:07:43] <agcolom> so merge radio buttons and checkboxes?
[12:07:44] <toddmparker> so if check and radio are one script have one widget called "Forms: Checkboxes and Radiobuttons" or wahtever
[12:07:48] <toddmparker> yes
[12:08:03] <agcolom> ok
[12:08:13] <toddmparker> it should map to the scope of each script, but can be named clearly
[12:08:24] <agcolom> ok
[12:08:38] <agcolom> and I now have the correct css there :-)
[12:09:09] <toddmparker> AlexSchmitz: you're on triage and demos right now
[12:09:20] <toddmparker> and that fixed toolbar hack extension
[12:09:26] <AlexSchmitz> yup
[12:09:28] <toddmparker> cool
[12:09:33] <toddmparker> gseguin: what's up
[12:09:43] <gseguin> Builder issue
[12:10:02] <gseguin> I'm adding support for existing semver tags
[12:10:18] <gseguin> as opposed to newly added ones which we already support
[12:10:37] <toddmparker> ?
[12:10:37] <gseguin> other than that, PR reviewing
[12:10:49] <toddmparker> great, I'd like to stay on that
[12:11:11] <gseguin> it will prevent having to keep the puppet config in sync with our tags
[12:11:22] <toddmparker> there are some simple features/fixes for 1.3 you could pick from
[12:11:27] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&sort=updated&state=open
[12:11:53] <gseguin> ok will take a look
[12:12:36] <gseguin> that's it for me
[12:12:47] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: how goes the prep?
[12:12:53] <toddmparker> AlexSchmitz: you too
[12:12:59] <toddmparker> both are doing press soon
[12:13:10] <RWhitbeck> Doing well.  Little behind but will rectify that this weekend.
[12:13:33] <RWhitbeck> Might bounce some thoughts off you all in the dev chat
[12:13:36] <AlexSchmitz> good got a bit of a suprise yesterday ajpiano forgot to tell me they promised them the slides tomorrow so have a week less then i thought
[12:14:06] <AlexSchmitz> so trying to bang those out
