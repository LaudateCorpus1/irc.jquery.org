[10:01:24] <arthurvr> sfrisk: hey-hey
[10:01:59] <sfrisk> arschmitz, arthurvr, cgack, helen, gqlog, jzaefferer, kborchers, michaelarestad, rxaviers, ryanneufeld, scott_gonzalez
[10:02:08] <arschmitz> dam____:
[10:02:12] <michaelarestad> Hi. :)
[10:02:15] <helen> hi :)
[10:02:27] <sfrisk> Meeting Notes: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:03:11] <sfrisk> So I'll be here first half of the meeting, and then anything left, arschmitz is taking over, since I've got another meeting I need to run to
[10:04:21] <sfrisk> michaelarestad - any news on that blank line issue with the file structure commit?
[10:04:47] <michaelarestad> No news, but disclaimer, i have done very little this past week.
[10:05:00] <sfrisk> It's okay
[10:05:22] <sfrisk> Life/work happens
[10:05:35] <sfrisk> although when you get a sec, could you make your typography work a PR?
[10:05:51] * rxaviers is in standby
[10:06:59] <michaelarestad> sfrisk: Yep. It'll be a little less nutty if you or someone merges the file structure PR.
[10:07:27] <sfrisk> Okay, I can make that a priority first then
[10:07:46] <sfrisk> one we figure out the blank line issue
[10:08:04] <arschmitz> we can either ignore that
[10:08:08] <arschmitz> or manually add it for now
[10:08:13] <sfrisk> true
[10:08:16] <arschmitz> but we should not let it hold things up i think
[10:08:20] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:08:26] <sfrisk> might be easier to ignore for now
[10:08:34] <sfrisk> but I'll do some research tonight
[10:08:38] <arschmitz> not sure it will pass css lint or not
[10:08:47] <arschmitz> if we ignore so we need to verify that
[10:08:52] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:09:11] <sfrisk> Also I've submitted in a PR for the CSS style guide to discourage the use of !important
[10:09:24] <sfrisk> and add that to the csslint requirements
[10:10:05] <michaelarestad> Nice.
[10:10:16] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[10:11:22] <sfrisk> hopefully we'll get that on the site soon, although it might mean some refactoring for mobile/ui :-/
[10:11:34] <arschmitz> mostly mobile
[10:11:44] <arschmitz> if not entirely
[10:11:49] <arschmitz> :-(
[10:12:11] <sfrisk> oh those silly importants
[10:12:15] <sfrisk> alright, which leads us to the big major thing that has been done this week is Perf Testing With arschmitz!
[10:12:26] <sfrisk> that leads us  to *
[10:12:52] <sfrisk> arschmitz, do you want to talk about the work you've done this week?
[10:12:55] <arschmitz> sure
[10:13:17] <arschmitz> So i just went ahead and set this up since we had not made any progress on it
[10:13:55] <arschmitz> I was able to get the whole setup done with NPM execpt for setting up a couchdb
[10:14:13] <arschmitz> but thats as simple as download the right executable and open it
[10:14:38] <arschmitz> to start with for comparing frameworks i started with just button
[10:15:04] <arschmitz> and just UI, Mobile, Bootstrap, and Foundation 5
[10:15:05] <arschmitz> http://104.236.81.132:5984//css-perf/_design/site/index.html#/page-select
[10:16:00] <arschmitz> a few things i noticed about these tests in general is they are HIGHLY enviroment dependant
[10:16:25] <sfrisk> How so?
[10:16:38] <arschmitz> i got huge differences just running on different monitors on same computer
[10:16:43] <arschmitz> or depending on what else was open
[10:16:49] <arschmitz> anything really
[10:17:15] <arschmitz> so this would never give usable numbers with a CI like travis
[10:17:33] <arschmitz> because its too load dependant same with saucelabs or browserstack
[10:18:07] <arschmitz> It seems like to make this usefull for a CI it would need to be a completely standalone server that only runs this
[10:18:21] <arschmitz> which we can do
[10:18:22] <sfrisk> Is that something we can get going?
[10:18:24] <sfrisk> lol, nm
[10:18:48] <arschmitz> i already have a DO droplet for the couch DB and the dashboard
[10:18:54] <arschmitz> which is what is linked above
[10:19:35] <arschmitz> i need to move this and setup a few things but anyone that is going to be working on this and wants access to push results to that PM me and ill set you up
[10:20:36] <arschmitz> adding additional components and or frameworks is really easy
[10:20:38] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/34/files#diff-0c84e212ba5a019f269b37c234ea03e8R1
[10:20:41] <michaelarestad> I'm going to look through what you have and give feedback on the PR.
[10:21:09] <arschmitz> it just involves making options hashes and a function to generate the markup
[10:21:57] <michaelarestad> Very cool.
[10:21:58] <arschmitz> once everyone is happy with the basics of how this works ill add info on the readme for running and setting this up
[10:22:26] <sfrisk> Sounds good.  Should be easy enough from there to be able to use it to test things other than buttons
[10:22:44] <arschmitz> yeah just add to the existing files
[10:22:57] <arschmitz> and it generates every possible comobo based on the options
[10:23:07] <arschmitz> and puts X number onto the page
[10:23:45] <sfrisk> Awesome
[10:24:09] <arschmitz> using a url scheme of /component/{component}/framework/{framework}/count/{count}/{title}
[10:24:26] <arschmitz> i was going to just use query strings but it breaks the test results in perfjankie
[10:25:33] <arschmitz> because it uses the file+query as a query to display results
[10:25:42] <arschmitz> so you end up with a double query string
[10:26:03] <michaelarestad> That's not that bad.
[10:26:12] <arschmitz> no its simple enough
[10:26:41] <arschmitz> so to view the test pages local you can jsut grunt connect:dev
[10:26:49] <arschmitz> and it will start it up on localhost:4200
[10:27:01] <arschmitz> and just construct the url for what you want to see
[10:27:13] <michaelarestad> Cool.
[10:27:24] <arschmitz> to run the perf tests its just grunt perf
[10:27:36] <michaelarestad> Can't wait to try it out tonight.
[10:27:38] <arschmitz> that starts a local server and a selenium server
[10:27:43] <arschmitz> and runs the tests
[10:27:57] <sfrisk> Very cool stuff
[10:28:00] <jzaefferer> I commented on the PR
[10:28:07] <arschmitz> and posts to a couchdb at localhost:5984
[10:28:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i had talked about this with scott_gonzalez and we do this on sizzle
[10:28:50] <arschmitz> and its all in the same repo
[10:29:00] <arschmitz> so thats why i did it this way here
[10:29:32] <arschmitz> and no there is no way around the couchdb
[10:30:57] <arschmitz> ok until people have time to play with / review unless someone has more questions about it thats all i have
[10:31:04] <sfrisk> okay
[10:31:25] <sfrisk> I put some updates in the meeting notes, I'll add them to meetings.jquery later
[10:31:41] <sfrisk> So, is there anything else we want to discuss today?
[10:32:45] <michaelarestad> Not yet. I still have some todos from last week.
[10:33:09] <sfrisk> Oh, also arschmitz and I will be talking about Chassis at the JavaScript Summit next month
[10:33:27] <michaelarestad> Rad!
[10:34:05] <arschmitz> Yup trying to get the word out
[10:34:25] <arschmitz> I talked about it back in novemeber when it was still mostly an idea with out a name
[10:34:36] <arschmitz> so it will be nice to get it out that its a real thing now
[10:34:41] <sfrisk> we've got some other stuff possibly lined up too, that I should know for certain about next meeting.
[10:35:11] <arschmitz> Yup :-)
[10:35:14] <michaelarestad> I'm going to draft a few people as we get a bit further.
[10:35:22] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: awesome
[10:35:50] <arschmitz> if we can get the current PR's landed that gets us to the point of starting to write some actual stuff
[10:35:59] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:36:13] <sfrisk> I'll make it a priority this week
[10:36:37] <arschmitz> im going to push hard on the perf stuff once we get feedback
[10:36:53] <arschmitz> also going to ping the creator of perf jankie about some things i ran into or would be nice
[10:37:07] <arschmitz> and suggestions on best way to deal with it being so enviroment dependant
[10:37:20] <sfrisk> Also if anyone has anything that they want on the html style guide, could you please add it to: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/92
[10:37:48] <michaelarestad> Added to my list of todos.
[10:38:07] <sfrisk> I'll try to incorporate it all together so I can rewrite http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/html/
[10:38:23] <sfrisk> after that, I think it would be good to tackle a scss style guide
[10:38:52] <arschmitz> awesome
[10:39:02] <sfrisk> And then code!
[10:39:03] <sfrisk> :-D
[10:39:14] <michaelarestad> Rad.
[10:39:35] <sfrisk> Okay, so I think that's it for this week.
[10:39:54] <sfrisk> See y'all same time, same place next week
[10:40:12] <michaelarestad> Yep!
[10:40:36] <arthurvr> bye!
