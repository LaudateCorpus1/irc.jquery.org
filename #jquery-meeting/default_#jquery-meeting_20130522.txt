[08:59:48] <kborchers> hey
[09:00:04] <rxaviers> hello
[09:00:09] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:00:12] <petersendidit> hey
[09:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> There's not too much on the agenda this week.
[09:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> I've been in docs land for the past week.
[09:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to give a download builder update?
[09:01:38] <rxaviers> sure..
[09:02:55] <rxaviers> I've been working on DB-side of the cutoff. Actually, separating the pre-reqs-part of our previous PR, so we can review that.
[09:03:16] <rxaviers> Basically the goal of this first PR is to make DB able to build jquery-ui files by its own
[09:03:28] <rxaviers> (concatenate, minify, change banner, change `@VERSION` variable, etc)
[09:03:59] <rxaviers> good news is, it's pretty much done. Im double checking it does not affect third parties (which is jqueryui.com tasks, and jquery-ui tasks like generate_theme)
[09:04:33] <rxaviers> Now, I've been also able to cache some built parts (using the same code we cache images), so we gained a little speedup on downloads.
[09:04:57] <rxaviers> (we use to cache things, but now it's caching even more)
[09:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> Faster downloads is always good :-)
[09:05:18] <rxaviers> :)
[09:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> So is the plan now:
[09:05:30] <rxaviers> PR soon showing the details so you guys can review
[09:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Make DB not dependent on jquery-ui generating a build
[09:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Make DB handle the full release
[09:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> 3) Remove inconsistencies inside jquery-ui
[09:06:52] <rxaviers> the first two are clear to me.. The third are not so much, because as I understood we're sticking with jquery-ui build too. So, we'll have separate code to build on DB and on jquery-ui.
[09:06:58] <rxaviers> third is*
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> #3 is about things like splitting out effects, moving demos, etc.
[09:08:24] <rxaviers> ah ok
[09:08:27] <rxaviers> so, yeap.
[09:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok, sounds good
[09:08:47] <rxaviers> I hopefully have a PR for the (1) today.
[09:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:09:09] <rxaviers> although, it has __proto__ code that I need to talk to you.
[09:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, let's ping rwaldron about that after the meeting.
[09:09:31] <rxaviers> I've talked with rick and he gave me some alternatives
[09:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> oh, ok, then let's not ping him after the meeting :-P
[09:09:56] <mikesherov> hi
[09:10:07] <rxaviers> ok
[09:11:37] <mikesherov> Can I give a quick update for a moment?
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:12:57] <mikesherov> I've been working on getting the PR queue straightened out, waiting on feedback from a lot of the submitters
[09:13:25] <mikesherov> I landed 2 pulls this weekend, and will be spending more time this weekend to get each one responded to or landed
[09:13:54] <mikesherov> 2. I am still procrastinating on the effects rewrite. I need someone to give me a drop dead date so I can get focused.
[09:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> I've got that droppable event order PR on my list to review.
[09:14:33] <mikesherov> 3. I'm working with Dave_Stein answering questions about the draggable rewrite, considering all the new tests he has to pass
[09:14:55] <mikesherov> we discovered some fun bugs in jquery.simulate.js, which is 4. on my list
[09:15:27] <mikesherov> I've updated it on my local git to be the same as master jquery-ui, but I want to add some tests, which I'm doing now.
[09:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:16:06] <mikesherov> I've carved out 2 days in the next week of time to work on these. Please let me know if there is anything more important to get done, or if my priorities are out of whack
[09:16:24] <mikesherov> and again, need the drop dead date for the effects rewrite so I can get motivated.
[09:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: How about Portland :-)
[09:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's pretty close though, not sure how much you have left to do.
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> We're certainly not ready to release 1.11 in less than a month.
[09:19:01] <mikesherov> Potland is June 11th?
[09:19:20] <mikesherov> I'm not going because I'm having a kid. But I'll get effects rewrite done by then
[09:19:34] <mikesherov> June 13th
[09:19:36] <mikesherov> done
[09:19:51] <mikesherov> I hate to report and run, but work is a crazy thing these past 6 weeks.
[09:20:02] <mikesherov> If you need me for anything specific, hit me up later!
[09:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> No problem. Thanks for the update.
[09:21:31] <tj_vantoll> I've got to get going in a few minutes as well.
[09:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll has been working on theming docs.
[09:22:22] <tj_vantoll> Discovered that a bunch of the docs articles had already been ported to learn.jquery.com.
[09:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> We've got http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/classNames/ (and a theming category)
[09:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> And there's a PR for the icons.
[09:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> I have to write up the .ui-front docs.
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> And then tj_vantoll is also going to work on individual theming docs.
[09:23:45] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, should be able to get started on that this weekend. I also want to try to link up some of the theming articles from jqueryui.com. Haven't figured out exactly how that should work yet though.
[09:24:11] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/39
[09:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of cross-linking to do.
[09:24:56] <tj_vantoll> If anyone has opinions on where those could/should be located please comment in the issue.
[09:25:10] <tj_vantoll> Anyways that's all I've got.
[09:25:12] <tj_vantoll> g2g
[09:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:27:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i have some simulate questions but can move to -dev if you want
[09:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> Might as well.
[09:28:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's move to -dev.
