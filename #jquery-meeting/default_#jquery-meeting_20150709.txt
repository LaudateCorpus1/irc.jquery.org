[09:01:04] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> Let's wait a few minutes and see if more people show up.
[09:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess nobody else is going to show up.
[09:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> The W3C test retrieval from jdalton landed in master.
[09:05:12] <arschmitz> Woo!
[09:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> Stefan's PR for the new W3C test is still in the review phase.
[09:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> While it would work fine for us with WebDriver, it isn't really suitable for manual testing, which is how the W3C test suite is currently used.
[09:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> See https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1949#discussion_r33968134
[09:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have ideas for how to make this less fragile while still testing what we care about?
[09:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking that the test ignoring additional mousemoves is probably fine.
[09:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> Even if a browser did send multiple move events on button change, it wouldn't hurt anything in practice.
[09:07:15] <arschmitz> yeah seems fine to me
[09:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll reply on the PR.
[09:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> Any news on touch action, arschmitz?
[09:14:15] <arschmitz> no jrossi had said he was going to set it up
[09:14:21] <arschmitz> but i have not heard anything from him yet
[09:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[09:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[11:04:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: apsdehal: cgack: gabrielschulhof: sfrisk: jasperdegroot: Meeting time
[11:04:13] <apsdehal> Hi
[11:04:17] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=784726753
[11:04:32] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:05:45] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[11:06:14] <arschmitz> Ok lets get started
[11:06:23] <arschmitz> Landed a lot of PR's this week
[11:06:29] <arschmitz> and closed a bunch more issues
[11:06:43] <arschmitz> We landed another classes update this one for slider
[11:06:57] <gabrielschulhof> Nice!
[11:07:14] <arschmitz> There is a PR for the enhancer updates needing review
[11:08:02] <arschmitz> We also landed a fix for a rangeslider bug
[11:08:03] <sfrisk> Yay!
[11:08:14] <arschmitz> from cgack
[11:08:31] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: your 2 classes PR's are looking close but need a few more updates still
[11:08:50] <gabrielschulhof> Right, sorry ... I need to look at them again ... I've been immersed in listview.
[11:08:57] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no problem
[11:09:03] <arschmitz> i just reviewed earlier today
[11:09:08] <gabrielschulhof> Aaaah, OK. Cool!
[11:09:31] <arschmitz> so one big 1.5 thing we wanted to address was 3rd party demos
[11:09:46] <arschmitz> we have 3 related issues
[11:09:46] <sfrisk> I should get my PR in for accordion Friday evening
[11:09:55] <arschmitz> sfrisk: awesome thank you
[11:10:04] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Did you intend to assign cgack to the page classes PR?
[11:10:09] <arschmitz> i took a stab at the 3rd party demos
[11:10:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: nope
[11:10:21] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK. I'll take it back then.
[11:10:25] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-3rd-party/demos/
[11:10:50] <arschmitz> I would like some feedback on the new homepage / sidemenu layout / header
[11:11:18] <sfrisk> It kinda bugs me how there is only one line of text below the image
[11:11:25] <arschmitz> i decided to rather then take the 3rd party ones out of the mix in the side to just clearly mark them 3rd party
[11:11:46] <arschmitz> sfrisk: its floated so thats based on your monitor
[11:11:55] <sfrisk> ah okay
[11:12:04] <sfrisk> well at that size it looked pretty awkward
[11:12:08] <arschmitz> we can changee it of course
[11:12:52] <arschmitz> how do people feel about the marking of 3rd party in the side nav?
[11:13:18] <sfrisk> Transistions needs an underline in the side nav
[11:13:19] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: A bit hard to read. The annotation has higher contrast than the demo title.
[11:13:29] <sfrisk> Where is the marking of 3rd party?
[11:13:39] <arschmitz> yeah im not crazy about the color
[11:13:40] <gabrielschulhof> sfrisk: Open the last item in the left-hand-side menu.
[11:13:48] <arschmitz> sfrisk: click navigation or misc or forms
[11:13:57] <sfrisk> ahhhh
[11:14:05] <arschmitz> i took the green we use everywhere
[11:14:11] <arschmitz> and gave it an opacity
[11:14:19] <sfrisk> I'm for marking it - however different icon or something for 3rd party demo?
[11:14:31] <sfrisk> have an icon* or something
[11:14:45] <arschmitz> yeah i dont know what icon would clearly communicate 3rd party
[11:15:01] <sfrisk> Maybe Isaac would have some ideas?
[11:15:23] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, wow! That's the nice, leafy green with an opacity ... looks a bit ... ummm ... visceral /o_O
[11:15:34] <arschmitz> sfrisk: for refrence part of what we are trying to address with this is https://twitter.com/raymondcamden/status/536981013574864897
[11:16:20] <arschmitz> We want to continue to feature 3rd party integrations but we need to clearly mark them but also keep them easy and logical to find
[11:16:22] <agcolom> hi, sorry got in late
[11:16:46] <sfrisk> hey agcolom!
[11:17:02] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem we are discussing my proposal for addressing 3rd party demos
[11:17:08] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: don't you think just naming the parent menu item 3rd party demos instead of misc demo will do?
[11:17:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: they are mixed in else where
[11:17:52] <jasperdegroot> oh sorry I misunderstood
[11:17:52] <arschmitz> those are truely just misc ones that dont fit a cateory we could have other non 3rd party ones in ther
[11:17:54] <jasperdegroot> looking again
[11:17:56] <sfrisk> hey, what if you used "rgba(51, 136, 204, .1)" for the background color for .jqm-3rd-party instead?
[11:18:06] <arschmitz> sfrisk: i would be good with that
[11:18:37] <arschmitz> im not crazy about the color
[11:18:38] <sfrisk> especially since blue tends to be used for linkable items on the page, while Green seems to be more secondary headings
[11:18:49] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yeah makes sense
[11:19:07] <arschmitz> i was just trying to use an existing color and chose that was the only real logic in the decision lol
[11:19:23] <sfrisk> yeah, the color I used was the blue in the links
[11:19:24] <arschmitz> i figured others would have ideas :-)
[11:19:34] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yeah i like it
[11:19:57] <sfrisk> as for the 3rd party demo text, it would be cool if we had some sort of badge we could put there
[11:20:19] <arschmitz> sfrisk: if someone comes up with something i would be happy to do that
[11:20:28] <jasperdegroot> yeah, we could make a "3rd party" badge icon
[11:20:52] <arschmitz> i really just wanted something to get us talking here thats why i didnt do a PR yet
[11:21:04] <sfrisk> other idea was having a banner, similar to the "Fork me on github" banners
[11:21:07] <sfrisk> https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons
[11:21:13] <arschmitz> so are we happy keeping the 3rd party mixed in and just making sure they are clearly marked
[11:21:20] <arschmitz> that way they are easier for people to find?
[11:21:34] <arschmitz> sfrisk: oh i like that actually
[11:21:36] <jasperdegroot> yeah mixed in is good idea
[11:21:39] <arschmitz> just on the right
[11:21:53] <arschmitz> oh they have right ones i just needed to scroll
[11:22:02] <arschmitz> I wanted to keep them findable
[11:22:18] <jasperdegroot> ribbon looks cool
[11:23:23] <sfrisk> I can put it on my list after the accordion to make a ribbon for it
[11:23:26] <arschmitz> does anyone want to try to come up with a banner?
[11:23:31] <arschmitz> sfrisk: awesome sounds good
[11:24:58] <arschmitz> ok next question the header
[11:25:08] <arschmitz> i removed the desktop specific sizinging
[11:25:26] <arschmitz> i wanted to make better use of the screen space and get more above the fold
[11:25:46] <arschmitz> it was my same thinking in changing the image and text
[11:25:50] <jasperdegroot> yeah smaller header looks nice
[11:26:07] <jasperdegroot> bit more modern / app style
[11:26:11] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:26:43] <arschmitz> i think the catagorized side menu is easier to use too
[11:26:48] <sfrisk> looks good
[11:26:59] <arschmitz> it does not make big changes just cleans things up a bit overall
[11:27:43] <arschmitz> sfrisk: if you have a suggestion instead of the float for the image too let me know
[11:27:56] <arschmitz> that was just the best i came up with through the whole range of screen sizes
[11:27:56] <sfrisk> trying to figure it out at the moment
[11:28:23] <sfrisk> part of me is almost "no images!"
[11:28:39] <gabrielschulhof> We could always add more text :)
[11:28:43] <arschmitz> it sounds like in general everyone is in agreement though to go with this just with some changes
[11:28:58] <jasperdegroot> that image is so outdated
[11:28:59] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:29:08] <arschmitz> it is but it still looks nice lol
[11:29:10] <sfrisk> that's kinda what I was thinking, gasperdegroot
[11:29:16] <arschmitz> i was thinking about that when i was doing this
[11:29:49] <sfrisk> Too bad our demo site didn't have links to websites using jquery mobile in cool ways
[11:30:07] <arschmitz> sfrisk: there is a whole site just for that
[11:30:09] <jasperdegroot> we have a gallery
[11:30:11] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[11:30:13] <sfrisk> Okay
[11:30:14] <jasperdegroot> on the resources page
[11:30:26] <arschmitz> sfrisk: http://www.jqmgallery.com/
[11:30:50] <sfrisk> be cool to have a link to it then more obviously from the demos
[11:30:52] <sfrisk> or something
[11:30:54] <sfrisk> I dunno
[11:31:08] <arschmitz> Yeah actually that makes sense
[11:31:15] <arschmitz> maybe in that top text
[11:31:16] <jasperdegroot> maybe we could make a nice illustration about JQM instead of a photo
[11:31:20] <jasperdegroot> for on the demo page
[11:31:28] <sfrisk> That would be cool
[11:31:40] <sfrisk> like an illustration that shows mobile, tablet, desktop
[11:31:44] <arschmitz> Yeah im totally open to any thing any one comes up with
[11:31:50] <sfrisk> without dating itself by looking like a few generation old device
[11:31:58] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:32:27] <jasperdegroot> will try to think of something
[11:33:26] <arschmitz> do we want to once we get the badge land the updates we have
[11:33:53] <arschmitz> and then work on the description area?
[11:34:01] <sfrisk> yeah
[11:34:10] <jasperdegroot> sounds good
[11:34:14] <arschmitz> ok it seems like that will be a lengthy task
[11:34:15] <sfrisk> Focus on the sidebar first, then main description area
[11:34:22] <arschmitz> yup
[11:35:30] <arschmitz> ok next
[11:35:38] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8184
[11:35:53] <arschmitz> we have a feature request to add an attribute for filterable
[11:36:00] <arschmitz> to exclude things from filtering
[11:36:08] <arschmitz> like headers
[11:36:28] <arschmitz> This seems like a common enough use case
[11:36:39] <gabrielschulhof> There's even a PR for that ...
[11:36:42] <arschmitz> and its easy to address currently for regular fitlerable with a callback
[11:37:01] <arschmitz> but the reveal you cant really workaround properly
[11:37:26] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot any thoughts on this/
[11:38:41] <jasperdegroot> sounds like a good idea to make that possible
[11:38:55] <arschmitz> Yeah the use case seems pretty common
[11:38:55] <jasperdegroot> have link to the PR?
[11:39:23] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8185
[11:40:21] <gabrielschulhof> Sounds good to me. Wanna milestone it for 1.5?
[11:40:35] <gabrielschulhof> Then, when the dust settles, we can look at the PR before we release.
[11:40:35] <arschmitz> yeah since we have a pr already
[11:41:14] <jasperdegroot> any preformance concerns?
[11:41:29] <gabrielschulhof> Not off the top of my head.
[11:41:33] <arschmitz> i have not looked at the PR because of the CLA
[11:41:34] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:41:37] <arschmitz> but it should not be an issue
[11:41:50] <gabrielschulhof> Actually, I found the author's name in the CLA list.
[11:41:56] <gabrielschulhof> So, the tag is a bug.
[11:42:05] <arschmitz> or they signed it after and didnt comment
[11:42:16] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, right. Good point.
[11:42:26] <gabrielschulhof> There should be a hook for when they sign ...
[11:42:52] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: there are many thingsthe CLA check should do
[11:42:54] <gabrielschulhof> ... but that may be expensive, because in response to a new signature you have to check all PRs authored by that person.
[11:43:03] <arschmitz> but some one has to have the time to write them
[11:43:18] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, I know *sigh*
[11:45:23] <arschmitz> ok failures on core git
[11:45:29] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: any update on this?
[11:45:50] <gabrielschulhof> No, unfortunately. I haven't had a chance to look at it :/
[11:46:23] <arschmitz> ok
[11:47:07] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5069
[11:47:20] <arschmitz> this is currently slated for 1.5
[11:47:57] <arschmitz> do we want to try to get this in?
[11:49:02] <gabrielschulhof> I'm reluctant to sign up for it, but it seems fairly straight forward.
[11:49:21] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i just mean regardless of who does it
[11:49:23] <gabrielschulhof> Just gotta hand-hold the new param from the click handler and through pagecontainer.change()
[11:49:50] <gabrielschulhof> ... and track it through all the copies that the .change() options go through.
[11:50:01] <gabrielschulhof> I suppose I can try to take it ...
[11:50:14] <arschmitz> ok so we will leave that as is for now
[11:50:19] <gabrielschulhof> Well, OK ...
[11:50:37] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: the issue i mean
[11:50:41] <arschmitz> like not move it to 1.6
[11:50:46] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'll take you off as the assignee though. I only set you to get you to comment on that.
[11:50:54] <arschmitz> ok
[11:51:09] <gabrielschulhof> But now that we've discussed it, I can comment that we'll try to squeeze it in for 1.5. Is that OK?
[11:51:18] <arschmitz> we also have some transition issues marked 1.5 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4259
[11:51:20] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes
[11:52:13] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, the ever-present toolbar wobbling ...
[11:52:30] <arschmitz> im more concern with your last comment
[11:52:40] <arschmitz> about a couple of the transitions being actually broken
[11:53:21] <jasperdegroot> hmm
[11:53:25] <gabrielschulhof> They're not, like, unusable. It's just the toolbar moves down one pixel during the transition.
[11:53:36] <gabrielschulhof> Super-weird.
[11:53:56] <arschmitz> oh ok
[11:53:58] <jasperdegroot> there is an old ticket for that
[11:54:11] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i thought you mean like broken broken not the 1 px
[11:54:36] <gabrielschulhof> Nono.
[11:54:37] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah the old ticket gabrielschulhof and i fixed at the dev summit in dc lol
[11:54:44] <gabrielschulhof> I just clarified in a comment.
[11:54:48] <arschmitz> WAY BACK!
[11:55:25] <jasperdegroot> I was talking about this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4259
[11:56:36] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats the one we are talking about :-)
[11:56:40] <arschmitz> thats what i posted
[11:56:56] <jasperdegroot> oh grab
[11:56:57] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:57:07] <jasperdegroot> sorry, was bit distracted
[11:57:30] <jasperdegroot> so many comments on that ticket ... didn't see it was the same
[11:57:30] <arschmitz> no problem
[11:58:00] <jasperdegroot> maybe we should decide to leave the transition issues for 1.5.1
[11:58:01] <arschmitz> ok so next question
[11:58:18] <arschmitz> do we even want to try to fix this since its pretty minor and we want to move towards js
[11:58:24] <arschmitz> is it worth the time and effort?
[11:58:35] <jasperdegroot> good question
[11:59:23] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, after all, this could be an idiosyncracy of CSS transitions.
[11:59:25] <jasperdegroot> we could look into it for 1.5.1 and if it's going to take too much time leave it
[11:59:36] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Good point!
[11:59:46] <gabrielschulhof> This is a bug, not a new feature, so we need not hit it in 1.5.0.
[11:59:59] <gabrielschulhof> ... nor is it a regression.
[12:00:01] <arschmitz> ok so lets move that one
[12:00:05] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:00:46] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: any update on the demos?
[12:00:57] <jasperdegroot> not really
[12:01:01] <jasperdegroot> I am working on it
[12:01:07] <jasperdegroot> should be able to do PR soon
[12:01:16] <arschmitz> ok
[12:01:21] <jasperdegroot> i mentioned the issue I ran into
[12:01:33] <jasperdegroot> with top/bottom icons
[12:01:43] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah i started looking into it will try to push an update ASAP
[12:01:49] <jasperdegroot> nice
[12:02:10] <jasperdegroot> if i run into other problems i well let you know on -dev
[12:02:17] <arschmitz> ok last thing i have is listview icons
[12:02:56] <arschmitz> this comes back to something jasperdegroot and i have talked a bit about which is the ability to do flush right / left icons
[12:03:22] <arschmitz> these are not what currently happen by default in 1.5 but are in 1.4
[12:03:40] <arschmitz> they are simple to do with a class
[12:03:42] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, good point ... in the RTL case they need to be left.
[12:03:49] <arschmitz> yes
[12:03:53] <gabrielschulhof> Here's what I have now: https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-mobile/commit/20165d0b7ce60b15df42f63d9b0a51cec1c2b7ef
[12:03:55] <jasperdegroot> yeah we decided to do a demo for that, right?
[12:04:16] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: we said demo for right because we didnt think we needed it
[12:04:17] <gabrielschulhof> (bottom of the commit)
[12:04:21] <arschmitz> and include a class for left
[12:04:27] <arschmitz> because we need it for checkboxradio
[12:04:34] <arschmitz> but not it looks like we need right for listview
[12:04:57] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec ... is there some media query or something for LTR?
[12:05:07] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: that is not the correct way
[12:05:14] <arschmitz> and thats really baddly specific css
[12:05:29] <arschmitz> all the class needs to do is float: right;
[12:05:31] <gabrielschulhof> Well, I wanted to avoid hitting nested lists.
[12:05:54] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: that why there should be a class on the icon
[12:05:55] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Will that always avoid having the icon wrap below the text?
[12:05:58] <arschmitz> and it should only apply to that
[12:06:25] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Right, actually, it should be a class key, because it's an element we generated.
[12:06:28] <gabrielschulhof> generate.
[12:06:32] <arschmitz> yes
[12:06:38] <arschmitz> well kinda
[12:06:45] <arschmitz> there should be a class key
[12:06:49] <arschmitz> but that should not have the css
[12:07:04] <arschmitz> it should just be like ui-icon-flushright
[12:07:22] <gabrielschulhof> OK, well, we've had ui-icon-end so far.
[12:07:29] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thats not the same
[12:07:34] <arschmitz> and is not used any more
[12:08:05] <arschmitz> end is the position meaning after text has nothing to do with its alignment
[12:08:14] <jasperdegroot> are checkboxradio and listview the only cases where we need to position the icon?
[12:08:24] <jasperdegroot> and maybe accordion
[12:08:26] <arschmitz> well need is a relative thing lol
[12:08:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no accordion text is align left
[12:08:58] <arschmitz> or i would assume it would be
[12:09:04] <arschmitz> have not seen it yet
[12:09:19] <jasperdegroot> just thinking about if we need a generic solution or widget specific css
[12:09:24] <gabrielschulhof> So, wait a sec ... if we float right, what do we do with the count bubble?
[12:09:38] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: a generic solution allows people to apply it to their buttons
[12:09:44] <gabrielschulhof> The count bubble is positioned absolutely right now.
[12:10:39] <gabrielschulhof> It sounds like we need to float both the count bubble and the anchor caret.
[12:10:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: true but also harder to make sure it works out well in every case
[12:11:15] <arschmitz> since its new we can specifiy its allowed usage
[12:11:25] <jasperdegroot> that's right
[12:12:37] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so, if my solution is incorrect, I'll nuke that commit right away. All I need from you then is to know the name of the class to add to the icon.
[12:12:59] <gabrielschulhof> ... and I'll add it in the code and, eventually, when the CSS lands, all will be well.
[12:13:46] <gabrielschulhof> Should I file an issue for this?
[12:13:57] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: did you want to take this one?
[12:14:23] <arschmitz> i think the basic cases we care about making sure this works are basic buttons checkboxradio and listview
[12:14:31] <arschmitz> anything else seems out of scope
[12:14:37] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, i will look into it a bot more
[12:14:45] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Do you need an issue?
[12:14:45] <jasperdegroot> and then discuss with you guys on dev
[12:14:52] <jasperdegroot> bit*
[12:15:01] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: no, not needed
[12:15:04] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[12:15:24] <arschmitz> lets pick a name though
[12:15:30] <gabrielschulhof> Yes, please!
[12:15:31] <arschmitz> so that gabrielschulhof can continue
[12:15:47] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:16:07] <gabrielschulhof> Also, if the name contains left and right meaning real, physical, left and right, then we need to switch in the JS depending on direction.
[12:16:21] <arschmitz> no it should be relative
[12:16:25] <arschmitz> like beginning end
[12:16:45] <gabrielschulhof> OK, then how will it be different from ui-icon-end?
[12:16:50] <arschmitz> ui-iconposition-flush-end
[12:17:00] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK.
[12:17:03] <arschmitz> ui-iconposition-flush-right?
[12:17:08] <arschmitz> i mean beginning
[12:17:19] <gabrielschulhof> *sigh* ... beginning is such a long word.
[12:17:22] <gabrielschulhof> start?
[12:17:26] <gabrielschulhof> (of text)?
[12:17:30] <jasperdegroot> i m not sure if "flush" is very clear
[12:17:31] <arschmitz> it should be consistent
[12:17:32] <arschmitz> with the option
[12:17:37] <arschmitz> which is beginning end
[12:17:42] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, it is? OK.
[12:18:31] <gabrielschulhof> Why not ui-icon-position-(beginning|end)?
[12:19:14] <arschmitz> well icon- implies it is an icon
[12:19:17] <arschmitz> not modifies one
[12:19:36] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so that's how the semantics works. OK.
[12:19:45] <arschmitz> ui-widget-icon-block
[12:19:50] <arschmitz> is what sets top / bottom
[12:20:12] <arschmitz> ui-widget-icon-flushend
[12:20:35] <gabrielschulhof> Ummm ... top/bottom is also somehow relative?
[12:20:41] <gabrielschulhof> I don't get "block"?
[12:20:58] <arschmitz> unless there is a btt langauge im not aware of i dont think it matters
[12:21:06] <gabrielschulhof> Right, exactly.
[12:21:06] <jasperdegroot> they should get block
[12:21:13] <arschmitz> block sets display-block
[12:21:19] <arschmitz> thats how it becomes top bottom
[12:21:29] <arschmitz> to get top you prepend and set block
[12:21:36] <arschmitz> to get bottom you append and set block
[12:21:39] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, so, block + beginning = top?
[12:21:46] <arschmitz> yup
[12:22:00] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Gotcha.
[12:22:01] <arschmitz> there is no bottom top class just a display-block class
[12:22:17] <arschmitz> which also centers the icon
[12:22:34] <arschmitz> so its a "block icon"
[12:22:39] <arschmitz> thats where the name comes from
[12:22:44] <gabrielschulhof> Gotcha.
[12:22:55] <jasperdegroot> let's use the name you suggested arschmitz
[12:22:59] <gabrielschulhof> So, wait a sec ...
[12:23:00] <arschmitz> the semantics is that its a utility class
[12:23:06] <jasperdegroot> so gabrielschulhof can move on
[12:23:07] <arschmitz> in ui those all are ui-widget-*
[12:23:21] <arschmitz> and it modifies icons so its ui-widget-icon
[12:23:30] <arschmitz> and then the modification is to set it block
[12:23:42] <arschmitz> sfrisk: kinda BEMish
[12:23:49] <gabrielschulhof> If you prepend, in RTL that becomes append, so RTL ends up affecting whether the icon shows up at the top or the bottom O_o
[12:23:52] <jasperdegroot> right
[12:23:56] <sfrisk> wait, what?
[12:24:00] <sfrisk> (sorry, distracted by work)
[12:25:12] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: good point to keep in mind
[12:25:17] <gabrielschulhof> Anyhoo, so ui-widget-icon-flushend?
[12:25:33] <arschmitz> but we dont really support rtl yet but we will need to think about that when we do
[12:25:39] <jasperdegroot> we can always change before merging
[12:25:51] <jasperdegroot> if someone knows something better
[12:25:53] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah lets go with that for now
[12:26:01] <gabrielschulhof> /o
[12:26:43] <arschmitz> ok i need to get going
[12:26:50] <arschmitz> i have a call in a few minutes
[12:26:55] <arschmitz> so lets wrap up
[12:26:59] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:27:03] <arschmitz> is there anything else anyone has for this week?
[12:27:31] <sfrisk> I'll get accordion PR up tomorrow night
[12:27:33] <gabrielschulhof> Nope. All good here.
[12:27:40] <arschmitz> sfrisk: awesome
[12:27:43] <gabrielschulhof> Sweet!
