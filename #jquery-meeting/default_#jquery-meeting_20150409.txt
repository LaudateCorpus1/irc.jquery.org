[09:01:02] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:20] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't have much time to work on PEP this past week. I was working on a task for another project which took me down quite a rabbit hole.
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> But I did get a chance to do some manual testing in all the desktop browsers, and arschmitz did testing on a bunch of mobile devices.
[09:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> Everything seemed good, so we're ready to release.
[09:03:06] <jrossi> sweet!
[09:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> I don't actually have anything else to discuss, since there hasn't really been any activity.
[09:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> We generally try to do releases earlier in the week, so I'll work on a blog post and try to do the release on Monday.
[09:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> Is anyone else interested in writing anything for the blog post or maybe doing announcements in other blogs?
[09:06:39] <jrossi> Happy to help.
[09:07:26] <jrossi> I'll need to check our blog schedule to see if we could do a short bit too
[09:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll get a rough draft together and then ping you.
[09:08:15] <jrossi> K sounds good
[09:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> I should have time to work on automating the W3C tests next week.
[09:10:32] <jrossi> Nice. What's your approach for automating the touch input?
[09:11:13] <jrossi> Just synthesizing touch events and making sure PEP produces the right pointer?
[09:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:12:45] <jrossi> K, I'm a total noob when it comes to automated JS testing, but I want to learn and can probably help here next week.
[09:13:21] <jrossi> I'm in the middle of a series of conference talks, but I should be able to find the time
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. I'll keep you posted.
[09:14:06] <jrossi> I assume these tests will run through Intern too?
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> They'll be functional tests in Intern that use Web Driver to synthesize the events.
[09:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we'll get the tests done soon and then we can start making some real progress.
[09:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'll also try to do a review of the existing unit tests to see how sane they are.
[09:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> Find out if the test failurs are legit failures or just bad tests.
[09:18:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: Feel free to let me know and i can help with tests too
[09:19:34] <jrossi> Is there value in someone manually running the w3c tests or has someone already done that?
[09:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think anyone has done htat.
[09:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> There are just so many pages to load.
[09:20:25] <jrossi> Maybe I can get our actual intern to do that :)
[09:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh, nice
[09:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think that's it for today.
[09:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.

[11:07:40] <b-ot> arschmitz: agcolom, arschmitz, arthurvr, cgack, gabriel_schulhof, ianmaffett, jasperdegroot, sfrisk
[11:07:43] <arschmitz> meeting time
[11:08:23] <sfrisk> Busy, but hi everyone!
[11:08:37] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:08:52] <kapil2105> hello from me too...
[11:08:59] <arschmitz> kapil2105: hi
[11:09:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:09:39] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[11:09:54] <arschmitz> big big changes on 1.5-dev this week
[11:10:32] <kapil2105> arschmitz: a big turn over i must say
[11:10:37] <arschmitz> we have updated the boiler plate to be a umd rather then an amd wrapper
[11:10:49] <arschmitz> our grunt file is now only ~50 lines long
[11:11:09] <gabriel_schulhof> ?BOOM - boilerplate
[11:11:09] <arschmitz> i broke that up and did a bunch of work on increasing test run times and stability
[11:11:20] <arschmitz> *decreasing
[11:11:38] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: Hey i need to email you back!
[11:11:42] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and /increasing/ stability, presumably ;)
[11:11:45] <arschmitz> yes
[11:11:46] <arschmitz> lol
[11:11:55] <arschmitz> we have been good and green there now
[11:12:02] <ianmaffett> @arschmitz - No problem.  Scott will be here next week, so if we need to schedule a quick call we can
[11:12:27] <kapil2105> arschmitz: thats really awesome...now no need to wait for long hours..
[11:12:42] <arschmitz> and our run times are down from ~100min
[11:12:46] <arschmitz> to ~20min
[11:13:15] <arschmitz> our total travis time is down to ~50min from ~250min
[11:13:39] <arschmitz> and local test runs are much faster too
[11:14:18] <kapil2105> arschmitz : is it for all the grunt tasks including navigation suite too...???
[11:14:33] <arschmitz> kapil2105: it wont speed up the actual tests
[11:14:43] <arschmitz> just does not do things like build every time
[11:15:11] <arschmitz> which took a long time when running individual suites
[11:15:47] <kapil2105> okkay...
[11:16:53] <arschmitz> also added a jscs task
[11:17:02] <arschmitz> and added the subset of new files which are passing
[11:22:27] <ianmaffett> eng
[11:22:27] <kapil2105> arschmitz: i was thinking would not it be good if we add swipe navigation between tabs ?
[11:22:32] <ianmaffett> *sorry mistype
[11:22:43] <arschmitz> huh?
[11:22:59] <arschmitz> kapil2105: does this somehow apply to the current topic?
[11:23:13] <arschmitz> anyway continuing gabriel_schulhof boiler plate pr
[11:23:24] <gabriel_schulhof> ... is now on 1.5-dev ...
[11:23:36] <arschmitz> and... will allow a good esformatter run
[11:23:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Hence the "?BOOM" earlier :)
[11:23:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[11:23:56] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm looking forward to clamping down on the coding style.
[11:24:20] <arschmitz> me too
[11:24:36] <arschmitz> im also going to add csslint csscomb and htmllint
[11:25:25] <arschmitz> unless there is some objection
[11:25:47] <jasperdegroot> what does csscomb do?
[11:26:04] <jasperdegroot> why is it needed next to linter?
[11:26:07] <arschmitz> its like esformatter for css
[11:26:19] <arschmitz> it is style not correctness
[11:26:26] <arschmitz> and it automaticly fixes issues
[11:26:45] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:27:49] <arschmitz> we are using it on chassis
[11:27:53] <arschmitz> and i like it quite a bit
[11:30:17] <arschmitz> ok so ill continue working on this
[11:30:38] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i have cherry picked yoru css commits
[11:30:45] <arschmitz> and will push as soon as the meeting is over
[11:30:48] <jasperdegroot> ok great
[11:31:44] <arschmitz> auto init is also pretty much ready
[11:32:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: has done a quick review the last thing it needs is just to add back degradeinputs
[11:32:13] <arschmitz> and to rebase with all this weeks changes
[11:32:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Suh-weeeeet!
[11:32:40] <arschmitz> I did another round of button updates this week and will bring those to mobile soon
[11:33:02] <arschmitz> which will also allow gabriel_schulhof to fix some other issues waiting on $.ui.safeActiveElement
[11:33:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes! We've already had three issues filed re: popups dying on IE!
[11:33:43] <arschmitz> yup
[11:34:05] <gabriel_schulhof> I keep closing them with "this'll go away when the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1560 lands - which is now waiting for $.ui.safeActiveElement ...
[11:34:14] <arschmitz> yeah :-/
[11:34:25] <arschmitz> that will be taken care of soon
[11:34:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, as long as we squeeze it in before 1.5.0, we should be good.
[11:34:49] <arschmitz> that should not be an issue for sure
[11:35:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I was thinking a bit about closing issues like that.
[11:35:36] <gabriel_schulhof> What if somehow the PR to which I keep referring doesn't end up landing?
[11:35:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Then, I should re-open all those issues, but I may not be able to track them down.
[11:36:02] <jasperdegroot> what is the status of textinput at the moment?
[11:36:27] <arschmitz> yeah you should close them all as dups of a single issue
[11:36:28] <gabriel_schulhof> So, maybe we should not close issues that would be fixed were a PR to land, but instead we should add Fixes gh-<new_issue> to the commit messages.
[11:36:30] <arschmitz> and refer that to pr
[11:36:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hmmm ... OK.
[11:36:45] <arschmitz> well assuming they are all the same issue
[11:36:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, yeah.
[11:37:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess in this case the PR fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1560, which is not exactly the same issue, but it can be fixed the same way.
[11:38:00] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyway, I /do/ remember this time, and next time around, I'll go with the dupe thing.
[11:38:08] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:38:31] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: textinput is ready to land right after your CSS changes, after one last review.
[11:38:42] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:38:50] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: I have only to rebase on top of post-your-CSS-changes 1.5-dev.
[11:39:09] <jasperdegroot> I think search icon css needs some attention
[11:39:42] <jasperdegroot> so I'll look into that when everything is in 1.5-dev and update the demo page
[11:39:47] <arschmitz> so tests just failed again
[11:39:51] <arschmitz> which brings up another issue
[11:39:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: wants to increase the test timeout
[11:40:10] <arschmitz> becasue it seems like we are getting a lot of load based timeouts on travis
[11:40:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... if nothing happens for 45 seconds, then consider phantomjs hung.
[11:40:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Right now it's 30 s.
[11:40:59] <gabriel_schulhof> phantomjs can also hang if there's a syntax error in the code.
[11:41:24] <arschmitz> but we know that is not the case here
[11:41:32] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but, presumably, we won't have such errors by the time things get to travis.
[11:41:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, definitely not the case here.
[11:41:49] <gabriel_schulhof> I can't think of anything besides load.
[11:42:05] <arschmitz> also for the most part a syntax error will be caught by jshint or jscs
[11:42:16] <arschmitz> which i set up as failfast tests on all runs
[11:42:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Syntax errors in the blah_core.js files containing the tests then also need such attention.
[11:43:06] <arschmitz> yup
[11:43:15] <arschmitz> they will get it once its possible for them to pass :-p
[11:44:06] <arschmitz> speaking of that we are working on bringing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1511
[11:44:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, yeah, I guess they don't lint overly well.
[11:44:08] <arschmitz> to mobile
[11:44:38] <arschmitz> which will be a big overhaul / cleanup of the test files
[11:45:49] <arschmitz> sorry thats wrong one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1528
[11:45:52] <arschmitz> thats the correct one
[11:47:29] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, we already use AMD in most tests via $.testHelper.asyncLoad(), so this should be a straight-forward switchover in most cases.
[11:47:57] <gabriel_schulhof> OTOH, the test helpers themselves will need to be organized AMD-ly.
[11:48:10] <arschmitz> well that was a kinda hacky solution
[11:48:30] <arschmitz> since qunit and qunit-bridge and others in our tool chain didnt actually support amd
[11:48:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[11:48:50] <arschmitz> there were new versions released of a bunch of projects including qunit to make this work
[11:49:42] <gabriel_schulhof> So, how does this mesh with our intention of switching to intern? Will intern work with AMD? I mean, they support the QUnit API, but do they also support this way of loading code?
[11:49:54] <arschmitz> intern only works with amd
[11:49:58] <arschmitz> there is no choice
[11:50:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Niiiiice!
[11:50:12] <arschmitz> so yes this plays nicely with that effort
[11:51:07] <arschmitz> we will also get a much more usable domEqual
[11:52:25] <arschmitz> so once some key pieces are pulled out of ui test infrastructure into their own repos / modules we will start using them
[11:53:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... where will our sequence runners fit? Like sequence() and pageSequence(), and the likes ...
[11:54:02] <gabriel_schulhof> ?
[11:54:21] <arschmitz> we can have test helpers
[11:54:24] <arschmitz> ui still does
[11:54:56] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but we should probably wrap them in a UMD boilerplate ...
[11:55:01] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and require() them.
[11:55:04] <arschmitz> of course
[11:55:06] <arschmitz> we will need to
[11:55:14] <arschmitz> there are examples of that in ui
[11:56:54] <arschmitz> so after last weeks testocolypse right before meetings
[11:57:00] <arschmitz> things are looking much betterthis week
[11:59:18] <arschmitz> ok so its that time
[11:59:26] <arschmitz> this was kinda a testing focused meeting this week
[11:59:34] <arschmitz> but i think we needed to get some things cleaned up there
[12:01:24] <arschmitz> is there anything anyone wants to discuss?
[12:02:17] <arschmitz> ok i will see everyone back in -dev then
[12:02:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Naw ... I guess that's it.
[12:02:21] <arthurvr> Bye guys!
[12:02:24] <gabriel_schulhof> L8R
[12:02:25] <jasperdegroot> later all
