[09:03:25] <arschmitz> fnagel:
[09:03:34] <arschmitz> i think we are the only ones here
[09:03:38] <arschmitz> if your here lol
[09:03:51] <fnagel> I am :-D
[09:03:53] <fnagel> Sooo
[09:04:06] <arschmitz> probably no point in meeting
[09:04:14] <fnagel> I have no updates anyway
[09:04:32] <arschmitz> yeah jzaefferer is on vacation and scott_gonzalez is recovering
[09:04:41] <arschmitz> so i dont expect to hear from either this week
[09:05:21] <fnagel> seems so
[09:06:15] <arschmitz> fnagel: if you have a minute though at some point would love opinions on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1586
[09:06:49] <fnagel> give me a second
[09:07:02] <arschmitz> trying to make sure all our form controls are consistent when placed next to each other like native ones are
[09:14:41] <arschmitz> fnagel: im going to close the room though no point in calling this a meeting
[09:14:47] <arschmitz> see you in -dev
[09:14:48] <fnagel> I think the changes make sense and look good on Win8.1 Chrome (button is a little smaller 32.78... to 33px height for button).
[09:14:56] <fnagel> ok
[09:15:15] <arschmitz> fnagel: well thats actually basedo on the button re-write
[09:15:23] <arschmitz> so it might be slightly different
[09:15:37] <fnagel> seems like a strange default height for button
[09:15:53] <arschmitz> fnagel: selectmenu is a little off on master too but fixed in re-write
[09:16:08] <arschmitz> fnagel: its set in em
[09:16:43] <fnagel> ahh ok
[09:16:58] <arschmitz> fnagel: but the 33 the even number is what it is in re-write
[09:17:05] <fnagel> PR looks good to me
[09:17:11] <arschmitz> so your concern is already addressed once that lands
[09:17:29] <arschmitz> :-)
[09:18:33] <arschmitz> ok see you in -dev
