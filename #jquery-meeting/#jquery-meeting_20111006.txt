[11:01:03] <toddparker> Hi all - we'll start the jQuery Mobile team meeting in a minute
[11:01:18] <toddparker> chime in if you're here
[11:01:46] <Wilto> Present.
[11:02:19] <toddparker> Johnbender, kinblas ?
[11:02:34] <kinblas> here
[11:02:50] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[11:03:03] <kinblas> @toddparker: mornin'
[11:03:37] <toddparker> hey
[11:03:45] <toddparker> trying to get bender in here
[11:05:17] <scottjehl> heyo
[11:05:25] <kinblas> hey scott
[11:05:41] <scottjehl> how's it going, Kin?
[11:05:44] <jzaefferer> hey scottjehl, thanks for letting me you use your desk :-)
[11:06:15] <scottjehl> jzaefferer did you have to kill Wilto for it?
[11:06:15] <toddparker> scottjehl: you lost your desk
[11:06:23] <kinblas> scottjehl: it's goin' ... lots of swirl internally after the big MAX conference ... tryin' to plug away at nav bugs
[11:06:25] <scottjehl> wow. that was quick
[11:06:34] <kinblas> lol
[11:06:37] <scottjehl> yeah max sounded pretty exciting
[11:06:37] <Wilto> Dude, that feels like hallowed ground—I’m sticking with the kids’ table for now.
[11:06:48] <jzaefferer> scottjehl: not yet
[11:06:50] <scottjehl> you have a window, though
[11:07:13] <toddparker> Alrighty
[11:07:32] <toddparker> So I just wanted to chat about any issues that need to be discussed
[11:07:54] <toddparker> the overall goal is to try and close as many issues tagged to RC2 in the next 4-5 days
[11:07:55] <kinblas> @toddparker: pushstate bugs are worrying me
[11:08:06] * kinblas rephrases
[11:08:11] <kinblas> pushtate bugs in browsers
[11:08:31] <scottjehl> :/
[11:08:36] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=9
[11:08:37] <scottjehl> how bout that Chrome bug?
[11:08:43] <scottjehl> any progress
[11:08:50] <kinblas> scottjehl: there's a bug in Safari too
[11:09:41] <toddparker> so kin, how worried are you?
[11:09:55] <toddparker> are these just known issues that we need to document?
[11:10:17] <kinblas> depends on how often folks are using rel="external" or data-ajax="false" to load external multi-page documents
[11:10:35] <kinblas> @toddparker: yeah we need to document them
[11:10:46] <kinblas> we need to file one against Safari too
[11:10:52] <kinblas> I haven't had time to strip jqm out of the picture
[11:11:09] <scottjehl> different bug than the chrome one then ya?
[11:11:10] <kinblas> other topic before I forget
[11:11:34] <kinblas> scottjehl: I think so ... the browser is calling popstate when loading the new document
[11:11:45] <toddparker> ok, so you're not suggesting that we pull this, just that we need to document known issues
[11:11:45] <kinblas> with the state of the previous document's last push/replacestate
[11:12:04] <kinblas> @toddparker: problem is folks can't distinguish between a jqm bug and a browser bug
[11:12:08] <kinblas> they will just assume it's us
[11:12:24] <kinblas> so if we leave it on by default, we need to make sure we document
[11:12:31] <kinblas> and make sure folks can find it easily
[11:12:39] <toddparker> that's why if we tacked this as a note in the docs and explained it, maybe we'll be better
[11:12:58] <kinblas> scottjehl: the symptom is folks navigate to an external jqm doc, but then it looks like the browser does a back
[11:13:59] <kinblas> the 2nd topic before I forget
[11:14:10] <kinblas> is that the unit tests are failing randomly for me when running locally
[11:14:17] <kinblas> it's wonky again for some reason
[11:14:19] <kinblas> not sure why
[11:14:48] <scottjehl> hrm k
[11:14:53] <scottjehl> Bender around?
[11:15:12] <jzaefferer> he's on the Skype backchannel
[11:18:26] <toddparker> so this big issue is inconsistencies between replaceState and the sequence of events
[11:18:41] <toddparker> between browsers like Chrome and Safari
[11:20:02] <toddparker> these are browser bugs
[11:20:14] <toddparker> can we do anything on our end?
[11:20:57] <toddparker> should we ignore pop state if the history is empty?
[11:21:19] <toddparker> that might be a possible solution for the wonkiness
[11:23:07] <toddparker> kin has a bookmarked that allows people to profile page events, pop state, etc.
[11:23:17] <toddparker> we'll add this to github repo
[11:23:24] <toddparker> so everyone can use it
[11:28:48] <toddparker> bender will look at these issues using kin's tool
[11:28:56] <toddparker> and can document it
[11:35:51] <toddparker> we'll recommend that is you use del=external a lot, you may want to disable push state until browsers catchup
[11:36:01] <toddparker> rel= ^^
[11:37:23] <toddparker> No longer able to remove / expire pages reliably - Should we allow the root page to be deleted if specifically set to not cache?
[11:37:33] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2520#issuecomment-2308290
[11:37:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2520 on jquery-mobile, reported by dgeb (1w, 5d ago): No longer able to remove / expire pages reliably
[11:39:03] <toddparker> two issues: when returning to a page, they see a cached version
[11:39:16] <toddparker> but the headers should resolve this if set
[11:41:04] <toddparker> do we need to educate on this?
[11:41:12] <toddparker> by adding docs
[11:44:14] <toddparker> second: should we allow the base page to be removed
[11:44:54] <toddparker> we could support this with some additional logic, but this feels risky
[11:46:44] <toddparker> for 1.0, we need to leave the home/start page
[11:47:00] <toddparker> but we can re-visit this after 1.0
[11:49:12] <toddparker> other issues: if people have script blocks in the body, they could re-execute if we re-loaded the page
[11:50:03] <toddparker> we should add a section on best practices for loading scripts here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-scripting.html
[11:52:44] <toddparker> next issue:
[11:52:44] <toddparker> pageshow fires multiple-times (conflicts with data-rel="back") - Not an issue?
[11:52:50] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2618
[11:52:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2618 on jquery-mobile, reported by mathiaslin (1d, 4h ago): pageshow fires multiple-times (conflicts with data-rel="back")
[11:54:05] <toddparker> this is an example of how we need to document script loading in the body and using live
[11:54:52] <toddparker> scott will add some additional info to the docs page to address these
[11:56:33] <toddparker> Next...
[11:56:34] <toddparker> Switch to jQuery core 1.7 now or wait for the next RC?
[11:57:59] <toddparker> timing is tricky here because we're not sure when 1.7 is final
[11:59:13] <toddparker> leaning towards staying with 1.6.4 for 1.0
[12:01:17] <toddparker> so we can release faster with less risk
[12:01:38] <toddparker> next
[12:01:40] <toddparker> Fixed toolbars, esp footers - need to re-position more robustly or provide a hook to call?
[12:01:40] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/search?q=fixed+footer
[12:07:00] <toddparker> kin will take a look, todd with flag issues with RC2
[12:11:17] <toddparker> iOS5 - still off by default but we need to wait for the 12th to see how solid it is
[12:11:24] <toddparker> we could turn this on by default
[12:14:07] <toddparker> zoom is a bit of an issue with iOS5, that's why we disable zooming
[12:14:12] <toddparker> Todd can re-test
[12:15:30] <scottjehl> kinblas http://filamentgroup.com/examples/iosScaleBug/
[12:22:47] <toddparker> this issue
[12:22:48] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2558
[12:22:49] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2558 on jquery-mobile, reported by kurteknikk (1w, 1d ago): Dialog's parent page shouldn't be removed when dialog is open
[12:39:47] <toddparker> Alright all, wrapping up
