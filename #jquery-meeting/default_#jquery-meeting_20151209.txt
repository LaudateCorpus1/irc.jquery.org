[12:01:45] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:00] <fnagel> hey
[12:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with datepicker.
[12:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> globalize-runtime was merged.
[12:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel has been working on the focus issue.
[12:03:22] <fnagel> waiting for some feedback on the PR
[12:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> I did an initial review. Looks like fnagel pushed some updates after that.
[12:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do another round of review. Can you just post a comment saying it was updated so it show up in my inbox again?
[12:05:05] <fnagel> Not reallyOk
[12:05:08] <fnagel> Ahh sorry
[12:05:12] <fnagel> Will do
[12:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> I was finally able to get a hold of Adam. We're meeting tonight to try to figure out what's going on with the 1.12 API site.
[12:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> I did a test release and everything seemed to be good.
[12:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> So that's all we're waiting on.
[12:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a blog post ready if anyone wants to review it: http://blog.jqueryui.com/?p=1286&preview=true
[12:09:31] <arschmitz> nice
[12:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't have an account on the blog, just let me know and I'll get you added.
[12:09:48] <arschmitz> if only i could see it lol
[12:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: check your email :-)
[12:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: You too :-)
[12:11:54] <fnagel> check
[12:14:28] <arschmitz> sounds good
[12:16:02] <fnagel> looks good to me (except that most links 404 but thats ok at this state, right?)
[12:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, those won't work until the release happens.
[12:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard any complaints from the community about Trac since the upgrade :-)
[12:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> The only real issue I'm aware of is that we no longer have the announcer plugin installed, so we have less control over emails.
[12:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> Which means right now team members are not getting notified when new tickets are created.
[12:20:17] <arschmitz> les control meaning no notifications
[12:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there are notifications.
[12:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> But they're limited to people involved in the tickets.
[12:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
