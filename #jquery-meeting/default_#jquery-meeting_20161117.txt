[12:00:30] <bethge> Hi
[12:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, I still haven't looked at anything. I've been swamped with life and work :-/
[12:01:15] <bethge> No worries!
[12:01:28] <bethge> Got totally swapped these past few days as well
[12:01:36] <bethge> *swamped
[12:02:10] <bethge> Should we reschedule?
[12:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. Should we just push till December 1st?

[12:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. I'll do my best to catch up on everything and help out with tests.
[12:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, that terrible shopping day where you should just stay in your house :-P
[12:04:30] <bethge> True. It's the only part of the thanksgiving holiday that swells over to europe
