[09:01:05] <mikesherov> here
[09:01:17] <fnagel> ere
[09:01:21] <Dave_Stein> here
[09:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf jzaefferer kborchers ngsilverman petersendidit rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:01:42] <petersendidit> hey
[09:01:50] <rxaviers> hey
[09:01:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not here for long
[09:01:57] <kborchers> hi
[09:02:01] <mikesherov> gnarf: busy as I am? :-P
[09:02:06] <tj_vantoll> Yo.  Not here for long either (12:25ish).
[09:02:28] <Dave_Stein> speed meeting then ;)
[09:03:00] <Dave_Stein> i see scott editing the agenda
[09:03:14] <Dave_Stein> in the meantime mikesherov did you see my earlier messages?
[09:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> There's not too much to discuss today.
[09:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything for download builder?
[09:03:26] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: no, did not
[09:03:51] <rxaviers> last week I raised the list of things we need to do in order to move build into DB
[09:03:56] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov nearly all the draggable scrolling tests fail in suite, but not on rerun of individual test. couldn't find any factors that would cause it to break from other tests.
[09:04:11] <rxaviers> as we discussed last Wed
[09:04:21] <rxaviers> I need you guys to gimme your feedback
[09:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit is working through more widgets for the classes option.
[09:05:28] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: seems like one test has a dependency
[09:05:29] <petersendidit> I push up dialog, autocomplete and accordion this morning to the pull request
[09:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> oh, cool
[09:05:48] <sgharms> ohai
[09:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10.3 is almost ready
[09:06:36] <mikesherov> nice scott_gonzalez
[09:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> I need to review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/940
[09:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> And then I think we're ready to release.
[09:07:02] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov that's what I was thinking but I was looking at qunit-fixture, main, the draggable during drag and everything seemed identical for the rerun and the suite
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> So far we have 16 bug fixes going into 1.10.3
[09:07:14] <mikesherov> except for order
[09:07:16] <mikesherov> when qunit fails
[09:07:26] <mikesherov> on next run it'll run the failing test first
[09:07:37] <sgharms> i have added a commit to my open menubar story where bugs are fixed and unit tests added has been updated and is teady to land save (i hope) save one unit testing issue.
[09:07:51] <Dave_Stein> im just running draggable.html in browser on repeat in one tab, with another tab just having the rerun of specific test
[09:08:25] <sgharms> if i can get a quick glance on that its ready to be refsctored to look standard
[09:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: We should discuss what's acceptable input for containment.
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> It should probably be element, jQuery, selector
[09:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> But we should have a discussion about the non-selector strings.
[09:10:15] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez You mean if someone passes in a random word? Meanwhile array is gonna be backcompat based on the current API. We did want to remove it for next version though so you were right in PR
[09:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> I mean words like "parent" and "window"
[09:11:12] <Dave_Stein> oh whoops yeah i mean it needs a backcompat at the very least
[09:11:18] <Dave_Stein> i dont see why it needs to be in the next iteration tho
[09:11:26] <Dave_Stein> why support "window" when someone can do $(window)
[09:12:03] <Dave_Stein> but if I'm checking for string to know it's a Selector, then those strings would work anyway by coincidence essentially
[09:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> So you've got parent in there: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js#L543
[09:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> But the current version also has "document" and "window"
[09:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll need back compat + tests for those.
[09:12:50] <Dave_Stein> That was you copy-pasting I believe :D I was just looking at blame the other day to see if it was me or you for when I was doing array stuffs
[09:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> "window" is not a selector
[09:13:09] <Dave_Stein> how do you typically know if something is a Selector in the widget?
[09:13:14] <Dave_Stein> typeof X === 'string' or some other way?
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> blame doesn't show who wrote code BTW
[09:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're doing it recursively.
[09:13:58] <Dave_Stein> kk
[09:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> typeof === "string" is the only test, but if you're making exceptions, then the exceptions need to come first.
[09:15:11] <Dave_Stein> okay so to take a step back for a second
[09:15:20] <Dave_Stein> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137878/Draggable
[09:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> This element/jQuery/selector thing has been a sticky issue for years.
[09:15:37] <Dave_Stein> that wiki only shows Selector as an option
[09:15:49] <Dave_Stein> can we correct that to what we want in future so i know what needs to go specifically to backcompat?
[09:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> See http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4957
[09:16:29] <Dave_Stein> lol wow
[09:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to have a discussion specifically about this :-P
[09:17:37] <Dave_Stein> well at the very least we know we are gonna remove array
[09:17:41] <Dave_Stein> so i can still complete the PR i have open
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf mikesherov tj_vantoll: Anything you guys need to discuss before you leave?
[09:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:18:01] <Dave_Stein> but i don't think we should support string and then throw if user passes "parent" "document" or "window"
[09:18:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes
[09:18:17] <mikesherov> Just wanted to mention that i think tj_vantoll is doing is a great job
[09:18:33] <mikesherov> and also that I've been slammed at work the past few weeks getting the new quarter ready
[09:18:37] <Dave_Stein> just throw the error "Why on earth are you passing 'window'" when you can clearly do $(window) with the Element
[09:18:43] <Dave_Stein> ;)
[09:18:48] <mikesherov> and will have some time to finish up the effects rewrite in the next few weeks
[09:19:13] <tj_vantoll> Thanks mikesherov :)  And no I have nothing specific to bring up.
[09:19:13] <Dave_Stein> "parent" isn't needed since if the parent changes at some point in the app, the coder can update the option later to reflect that
[09:19:24] <mikesherov> I also want to call out that we are SO CLOSE to a passing testswarm run, we just need a few dialog tests fixed
[09:19:35] <mikesherov> focus / blur are nightmares, but fixable
[09:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> The never ending battle of focus management...
[09:20:12] <mikesherov> I can't figure the dialog tests out, but there are 3 fails, and then we'll have a green uild
[09:20:35] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: can you pretty pretty please fix those tests :-)
[09:20:44] <mikesherov> 1 on spinner, 3 on dialog
[09:20:49] <mikesherov> I'll handle the datepicker one
[09:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll look into that.
[09:21:46] <Dave_Stein> ok i'm out. i'll update the PR today. mikesherov I'll give another stab at the scrolling thing tomorrow if you can't take a look either before then
[09:22:44] <mikesherov> One other thing is we have a pile up in the PR queueâ€¦ I'd like to do a run through soon
[09:23:00] <mikesherov> I'll probably do that next week on Thursday/Friday
[09:23:15] <mikesherov> I'm off those days, so I'll get some quality focus time
[09:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I can probably join you for that.
[09:23:43] <tj_vantoll> I'm out, I'll be back in the main dev channel later this afternoon.
[09:23:47] <mikesherov> OK, scott_gonzalez let me know
[09:23:56] <kborchers> mikesherov, scott_gonzalez i could probably join too if you want/need another hand
[09:24:06] <mikesherov> I have to go as well, but that's all I got anyway. Would be great to get you on that kborchers
[09:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well sounds like this meeting is over.
[09:26:35] <sgharms> scott any chance you could give a short look at my pr?
[09:26:51] <sgharms> specifically the tab test?
[09:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I can tell you that all those one line methods needs to go away.
[09:28:38] <sgharms> agree re internals
[09:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> Also, not sure what's up with this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/953/files#L1R500
[09:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go through and add comments.
[09:29:54] <sgharms> lets focus on the test
[09:30:18] <sgharms> i will rewrite to make more like the style you like
[09:30:45] <sgharms> but why my tab keydown test fails is a blocker to that rewrite
[09:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:32:15] <sgharms> jorn gave me some why background so i'm going to collapse the code once i have some testa guarding bugs that creep in easily
[09:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> Let's continue any discussions in -dev.
