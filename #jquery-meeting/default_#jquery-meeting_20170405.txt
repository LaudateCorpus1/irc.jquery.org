[12:02:32] <fnagel> hi
[12:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:03:55] <arschmitz> hi
[12:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> So, I know arschmitz has spent at least some time on the button compatibility issue.
[12:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15109
[12:06:40] <scott_gonzalez> Because I helped him track down a problem yesterday ;-)
[12:06:46] <arschmitz> yeah i continued after we talked some
[12:06:57] <arschmitz> but there are still some test failures when i ran tests
[12:07:01] <arschmitz> so need to figure that out
[12:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if you need more help, just let me know.
[12:07:26] <arschmitz> like a lot of failing tests lol
[12:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Have you heard anything from Jon Gunderson?
[12:07:54] <fnagel> of course not
[12:08:38] <fnagel> We might need to contact some one else to help us out.
[12:08:44] <fnagel> Or just do it on our own
[12:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> We've got plenty of other a11y contacts.
[12:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> Hans, Birkir, Colin, Clown, etc.
[12:10:44] <fnagel> sounds good
[12:10:53] <fnagel> Hans = Hans Hillen?
[12:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> Birkir works for Deque. I actually met him in person at Panera when I lived in Raleigh before he worked for Deque. Pretty small world :-)
[12:12:18] <fnagel> JÃ¶rn asked Hans a few thing regarding selectmenu some time ago
[12:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> Colin = Colin Clark from the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University.
[12:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> Clown = Joseph Scheuhammer, also from IDRC.
[12:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> IDRC has a bunch of people that could help us, actually.
[12:13:19] <arschmitz> iv met both hans and birkir in person as well
[12:14:15] <arschmitz> there was someone well known we worked with a lot on mobile i could ping
[12:14:20] <arschmitz> his name is slipping me right now
[12:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> I've heard that we have access to Becky Gibson now as well.
[12:14:47] <arschmitz> scott whos the guy that was at yahoo and paypall for ever
[12:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, I can't remember his name.
[12:15:22] <arschmitz> you know who im talking about though right?
[12:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> Let's look at the devil's PR to find out...
[12:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I could've sworn he had commented on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/666, but I guess not.
[12:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> Victor Tsaran
[12:17:08] <arschmitz> he helped a bunch on mobile but i cant remember specific pr's
[12:17:09] <arschmitz> YES
[12:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> Is that who you're thinking of?
[12:17:14] <arschmitz> yup
[12:17:22] <arschmitz> hes always been very willing to help when iv asked
[12:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I mentioned him, but he wasn't involved in the PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/666#issuecomment-6192174
[12:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> second large paragraph in the comment.
[12:18:09] <arschmitz> yup i see it
[12:18:20] <arschmitz> but didnt use his github name so he probably never knew
[12:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, re-reading that thread is depressing.
[12:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> "I've always viewed Yahoo's mindset as ARIA by default is bad because it changes web behavior. I don't know if that's their official stance, but it would explain the behavior they implemented here."
[12:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> The struggle is real.
[12:19:21] <arschmitz> oh i guess he works on android now
[12:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> hacks on hacks on hacks
[12:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> Let's go back to Best Viewed in IE.
[12:20:03] <arschmitz> lol
[12:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> So, fnagel we have plenty of contacts :-)
[12:20:26] <fnagel> :-D
[12:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> If you need info for any of them, just let us know
[12:21:45] <fnagel> ok, need to figure out how and what exactly to ask but it seems we really have enough experts to ask...
[12:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> So our biggest areas to focus on right now are the button compatibility issue that arschmitz is working on and the memory leak issues we have all over the place with remove events.
[12:22:11] <arschmitz> i thought we fixed that?
[12:22:25] <arschmitz> i fixed part and you i thought fixed the other part
[12:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's a PR that I never landed.
[12:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't remember why the implementation is correct.
[12:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yup: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1769
[12:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> So, is it legit to remove all of the widget's events when we stop tracking classes?
[12:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> This was my original fix: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1769/commits/ac971a6384105a3911dcba00f3762cf20589dcf2
[12:25:11] <arschmitz> oh you changed it after i said it was good
[12:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but I changed it because of some conversation we had after that.
[12:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> I recall having the conversation, but I don't recall any of the details.
[12:26:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:26:21] <arschmitz> so i see what looks like a problem still with second
[12:26:23] <arschmitz> but not sure
[12:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, that method is only called on remove.
[12:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> Of the entire widget.
[12:28:23] <arschmitz> no the diff made it look like it was in different spot
[12:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> So that won't help with the problems that are being reported.
[12:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure this needs to be dealt with in the individual widgets.
[12:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually...
[12:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> We could add a remove event listener on the element that's getting the classes.
[12:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try that later.
[12:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:35:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: sorry on phone ping me later
[12:35:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:35:43] <fnagel> Just a new PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1802
[12:35:59] <fnagel> With broken travis tests :-/
[12:36:22] <fnagel> "works on my machine" - may be some timezone / daylight saving
[12:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> Just looked over the PR. Implementation looks good.
[12:39:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's probably a timezone issue, because it's going to return localized dates, right?
[12:40:10] <fnagel> pretty much, I've had similar issue locally
[12:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> I bet if you use the UTC methods, it'd work.
[12:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad we can't force timezones in tests.
[12:41:56] <fnagel> yeah, we'll need to figure out how to make sure we have reliable tests
[12:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> I think the only way to be reliable is to use UTC.
[12:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> Which doesn't really help us with testing all the localized methods.
[12:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> Which is basically everything.
[12:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[12:44:26] <fnagel> mh
[12:44:34] <fnagel> we'll see
[12:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> We could try something that's a bit hacky...
[12:44:42] <fnagel> it's already in the wiki
[12:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> Take a timestamp that we expect to be a specific time, then ask for the date and compare it to what we expect.
[12:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> Calculate an offset based on the difference and add the offset to every timestamp we use.
[12:48:02] <fnagel> So, basically calculating the timezone offset within the tests
[12:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
