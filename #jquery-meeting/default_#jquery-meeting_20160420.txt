[12:00:49] <fnagel> hi
[12:00:52] <arschmitz> hi
[12:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> There was a new issue filed that I'd like to fix before 1.12.0
[12:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14950
[12:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be working on it after the meeting.
[12:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm surprised nobody filed this earlier.
[12:06:16] <arschmitz> oh yeah i saw that one
[12:06:27] <arschmitz> i was also suprised it had not come up
[12:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's about all I've got though.
[12:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else to discuss today?
[12:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:15:24] <jzaefferer> I just responded on that selectable PR
[12:15:36] <jzaefferer> not much to discuss though
[12:16:02] <jzaefferer> looks like I'm still not getting emails from Trac about new tickets
[12:16:32] <jzaefferer> Felix wants your feedback on his classes implementation for datepicker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1698
