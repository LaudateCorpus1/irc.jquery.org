[08:34:25] <jzaefferer> Ping leobalter
[08:34:34] <leobalter> pong
[08:34:44] <jzaefferer> Looks like no one else is around :-)
[08:34:55] <jzaefferer> And we've discussed QUnit stuff just yesterday
[08:35:34] <arthurvr> yeah
[08:35:40] <jzaefferer> Its a bit unfortunate that our GSoC student Franziska is properly starting next week, when I'll be on vacation...
[08:35:44] <jzaefferer> hey arthurvr
[08:35:48] <arthurvr> hey-hey
[08:35:59] <jzaefferer> I sent her an email this week, but haven't yet gotten a response
[08:36:25] <jzaefferer> she wants to start working through the jsreporter issues, starting with event data
[08:36:34] <jzaefferer> leobalter: will you be around to help with that if necessary?
[08:36:58] <leobalter> is I will
[08:37:23] <leobalter> s/is/yes
[08:39:05] <jzaefferer> I did a triage of all open QUnit issues earlier this week, closed a bunch of stale or outdated issues
[08:39:29] <jzaefferer> Marked a few more with the help-need label and made a bit noise on Twitter, but that didn't seem to get any traction
[08:40:45] <jzaefferer> leobalter: how are you doing on your PRs?
[08:41:58] <leobalter> still going to work on them this week, I'm defining my next project at Bocoup and I'll probably have good time for QUnit
[08:42:16] <jzaefferer> Sounds good
[08:44:50] <jzaefferer> Hey arthurvr, while you're here, did you see the update I posted on the scroll animation issue for api.jquery.com?
[08:49:44] <arthurvr> yeah just reading through stuff
[08:50:41] <arthurvr> on that comment, jzaefferer, yeah I believe that’s the way to go
[08:51:53] <jzaefferer> I'd be happy to review PRs for that..
[08:53:40] <arthurvr> is there any really strong reason to prioritize that ticket over the ~250 other ones? I did actually agree we should make progress on those tickets quicker, it’s just time, you know. Also I’ve been trying to focus on v3 docs first.
[09:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[09:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, b-ot's not even in here.
[09:00:56] <arthurvr> hey there
[09:02:04] <fnagel> hey
[09:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ajpiano: How do you invite b-ot in here?
[09:02:14] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:55] <ajpiano> b-ot is not online rite now i think he is going through some stuff
[09:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer mikesherov
[09:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, ok. Thanks ajpiano.
[09:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed b-ot hadn't been working for a few days.
[09:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> So, let's get started.
[09:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> I started reviewing the button PR.
[09:04:07] <ajpiano> i think gf3 can fill us in more on that stuff
[09:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently the squashing wasn't completely done, so arschmitz fixed that today and I'll be continuing my review.
[09:04:33] <jzaefferer> that explains the lack of notifications so far :-)
[09:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> The form reset module and mixin support have both landed in master.
[09:05:08] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: you should have got a lot before i noticed and stoped him
[09:05:37] <gf3> scott_gonzalez: do you guys use b-ot here? i just took him offline yesterday because i didn't think he was really used all that much
[09:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we use him.
[09:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> For pinging entire teams at the start of a meeting.
[09:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> For pointing people to the topic when they join the wrong channel.
[09:06:21] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: oh yeah? Maybe I did unsubscribe from that PR...
[09:06:22] <gf3> scott_gonzalez: ahh cool, i can bring him back online then
[09:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> And for messages when people aren't around.
[09:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great. Thanks.
[09:07:21] <jzaefferer> nope, still subscribed. Also just one comment on a commit from 22 hours ago..
[09:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[09:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> The comments were directly on the commits, not on the PR.
[09:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> So even if you weren't subscribed, you still should've gotten the notifications.
[09:09:11] <jzaefferer> Dunno
[09:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you want to discuss jquery-git failures?
[09:09:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:09:35] <arschmitz> so we have essentially 2 different failures from the same commit
[09:09:38] <arschmitz> in core
[09:09:54] <arschmitz> the first is easily fixed and needs to be fixed
[09:10:00] <arschmitz> which is us calling offset on window
[09:10:08] <arschmitz> its a one line fix i have that already
[09:10:16] <arschmitz> the second issue is a lot more troublesome
[09:10:35] <arschmitz> they now return undefined from offset if the element is either hidden or disconnected
[09:10:51] <arschmitz> i think this is likely to be reverted though
[09:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:11:13] <arschmitz> because worse
[09:11:15] <arschmitz> on the setter
[09:11:21] <arschmitz> it will throw
[09:11:31] <arschmitz> and its not easy to work around
[09:11:46] <arschmitz> if your calling on a collection you need to do .each and do each one in its own try catch
[09:12:00] <arschmitz> i dont think we ever do this but its strong reason to revert
[09:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> And what about 1.10.1?
[09:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> Did you determine that this is new since AMD?
[09:12:21] <arschmitz> so 1.10.1 i dont see how we ever were passing on testswarm
[09:12:44] <arschmitz> and as long as there are logs there is no run on it that does pass
[09:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[09:13:05] <arschmitz> the issue is fundamental with 1.10.1 and testswarm
[09:13:26] <arschmitz> 1.10.1 has a bug that will throw an access error if you try to access a iframe on a different domain
[09:13:39] <arschmitz> and in testswarm thats exactly what we do
[09:13:51] <arschmitz> the tests are running on a different domain then the swarm page
[09:14:17] <arschmitz> and thats exactly the error thats being thrown when i log into any of those runs with ie
[09:14:53] <arschmitz> thats why i say i dont see how this ever could have passed
[09:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I guess we can remove from TestSwarm.
[09:14:58] <arschmitz> its not anything we are doing
[09:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> But https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1559 is not correct.
[09:15:28] <arschmitz> ok
[09:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> That's pretty much the opposite of the change we need.
[09:16:00] <arschmitz> ok
[09:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> You're removing the entire ability to test against 1.10.1, but you're keeping it in TestSwarm.
[09:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/tasks/testswarm.js#L8
[09:16:31] <jzaefferer> this is the line that needs to be changed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/tasks/testswarm.js#L8
[09:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only line that should change.
[09:16:48] <arschmitz> ah ok
[09:17:05] <arschmitz> thats way easier
[09:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so feel free to make that one line change and just push directly to master.
[09:17:27] <arschmitz> will do
[09:17:39] <jzaefferer> do we have any 1-x jobs that run against 1.10.1?
[09:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[09:18:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: what do you mean?
[09:18:29] <jzaefferer> no, looks like we disabled the 1-9-stable and 1-10-stable builds
[09:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh.
[09:18:38] <jzaefferer> http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Disabled/
[09:18:49] <jzaefferer> we never ran those against 1.10 anyway
[09:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> I closed the PR.
[09:19:14] <arschmitz> oh so one thing with the first window change on git
[09:19:31] <arschmitz> this will be fixed in migrate but scott mentioned doing a patch for old versions
[09:19:46] <arschmitz> since this completely breaks things using postion like menu
[09:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll do another 1.11.x release.
[09:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> We can do another 1.10.x release too, if we want.
[09:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> But definitely no further back since 1.9 isn't supported anymore.
[09:20:50] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:20:55] <arschmitz> probably makes sense here
[09:21:00] <arschmitz> because it does completely break
[09:21:17] <arschmitz> but we will want to wait on if core reverts the other change before i make any changes i think
[09:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> Sure.
[09:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> Once that's all resolved, we can get the releases ready.
[09:22:04] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[09:22:10] <arschmitz> we will be doing the same in mobile
[09:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> That brings us to removal of event aliases.
[09:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1556 is good to land.
[09:22:17] <arschmitz> it breaks us in similar places
[09:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> Were you wating on anything or did it just get buried in emails?
[09:22:25] <arschmitz> oh yeah ill land that after meeting
[09:22:48] <arschmitz> nope nothing there and ill submit the mousewheel and simulate ones too
[09:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:22:58] <arschmitz> so we can update to making that our default test
[09:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'll be good.
[09:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> We'll just need to rememer to generate new custom builds every time we pull in a new version of core.
[09:23:25] <arschmitz> uyp
[09:23:54] <arschmitz> just a happy side note
[09:23:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: b-ot is just offline
[09:24:05] <gnarf> pinged admins
[09:24:08] <arschmitz> i had to make no changes at all when i excluded  the deprecated module
[09:24:30] <arschmitz> so we were doing the right thing there already
[09:25:48] <jzaefferer> ps: I tried looking up download numbers for UI versions, but the report is broken; for anyone with infra access: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/325
[09:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:29:46] <arschmitz> demos
[09:29:50] <arschmitz> amd demos
[09:29:55] <jzaefferer> broken jqueryui.com
[09:30:14] <scott_gonzalez> broken jqueryui.com?
[09:30:20] <jzaefferer> I'd like to test the changes Rafael made and the demo stuff Alex did, but I can't get jqueryui.com to do anything at all
[09:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[09:30:52] <jzaefferer> last time I tried it spent five minutes doing something and then failing with basically no error message at all
[09:30:54] <arschmitz> i actually got jqueryui.com to work for the first time ever doing that stuff
[09:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I really need a big chunk of time to go through the download builder code and get jqueryui.com deployment working for everyone.
[09:31:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: fixes for node 1.12 did the trick for me
[09:31:22] <arschmitz> 0.12 i mean
[09:31:40] <jzaefferer> I had to downgrade to at least install npm modules
[09:31:49] <jzaefferer> despite those fixes
[09:31:57] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its weird your getting the erros that i had pre fix
[09:32:22] <arschmitz> but once i removed my modules folder and re installed it worked perfect
[09:33:03] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: , any progress on the spinner deprecations? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11097
[09:33:38] <arschmitz> oh yeah i have that done i had got side tracked with all the failures
[09:33:47] <arschmitz> on git
[09:33:54] <arschmitz> and then 1.10.1
[09:34:47] <jzaefferer> done?
[09:34:52] <jzaefferer> so just need to create the PR?
[09:34:58] <arschmitz> yes
[09:35:04] <jzaefferer> well, do that :p
[09:35:08] <jzaefferer> thaat's all I got
[09:35:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, just let me know if you need help testing 1.12 package on DB
[09:35:46] <arschmitz> rxaviers: ill ping gabriel_schulhof about that too to test mobile
[09:35:52] <rxaviers> I have to work on caching, but it's fully functional
[09:36:11] <rxaviers> ok arschmitz, feel free to ping needing help
[09:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it for today.
[09:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, AMD demos.
[09:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did you need to discuss stuff or just waiting on review?
[09:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't gotten around to looking at the PRs yet.
[09:43:27] <jzaefferer> I reviewed it, the new bootstrap.js looks good. I wanted to actually test it on the jqueryui.com and got stuck there
[09:43:58] <jzaefferer> the demo changes themselves are pretty simple and should be quick to review
[09:44:06] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: a review for the approach it self would be good
[09:44:11] <jzaefferer> much simpler than amd-tests
[09:44:21] <arschmitz> on both jqueryui.com and the demos them selves
[09:44:47] <arschmitz> right now it just does accordion and datepicker
[09:45:03] <arschmitz> didnt want to go all in until we all agree on the approach with the bootstrap
[09:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll get to that after button.
[09:45:39] <arschmitz> cool
[09:46:04] <arschmitz> more of what seems to be my typical lets change every file prs lol
[09:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for today?
[09:46:25] <arschmitz> note from me
[09:46:36] <arschmitz> not*
[09:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
