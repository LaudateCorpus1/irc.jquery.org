[08:58:38] <DaveMethvin> EARLY?
[08:58:40] <timmywil> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BadwSO6Sn91RBfr05s77r81ncEi0oMBJ5mZS-k215vg/edit#
[08:58:46] <timmywil> Should be short
[08:58:58] <timmywil> but you never know
[08:59:04] <DaveMethvin> you run a tight ship timmywil :)
[08:59:19] <timmywil> I'll take it. :)
[08:59:53] <timmywil> fyi, WE ARE RELEASING TODAY YOU CAN'T STOP IT BOOSH
[09:00:18] <timmywil> oleg is out today
[09:00:45] <DaveMethvin> gopher it!
[09:00:52] <timmywil> I see gibson in the notes, but not on irc
[09:01:03] <DaveMethvin> he didn't expect an early start
[09:01:25] <timmywil> there he is
[09:01:29] <timmywil> hi gibson042 !
[09:01:32] <arthurvr> hey everybody
[09:02:29] <DaveMethvin> hey arthurvr
[09:02:31] <timmywil> So, I think I've got the blog post in a good place. I'd love it if DaveMethvin could give it a read and make any desired changes. Also, I'm hoping gibson042 can look over the Promises section to see if I missed something or didn't describe it well.
[09:02:41] <gibson042> checking it out now
[09:03:29] <timmywil> For https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2365, I think we can document
[09:03:47] <timmywil> I still intend to explore adding back internal use of .push for selections.
[09:04:02] <timmywil> But it's not critical.
[09:04:03] <gibson042> if we do, those will be the only methods that mutate a context collection
[09:04:11] <gibson042> seems like a big can of worms
[09:04:58] <timmywil> I mean, really, I prefer to leave them on the jQuery object and not document.
[09:05:05] <timmywil> but it's hard to argue that case
[09:05:17] <gibson042> I'll argue that case
[09:05:19] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't want users using them because of the inconsistency
[09:05:41] <gibson042> they're for internal use, including intuitive display in debug consoles
[09:05:53] <gibson042> but they're not documented, and users shouldn't use them
[09:06:08] <DaveMethvin> so is the status quo okay?
[09:06:16] <gibson042> +1 from me
[09:06:25] <timmywil> I think so, but I expect pushback from markelog
[09:06:27] <DaveMethvin> people *could* use them but documenting entices them to use them
[09:06:36] <gibson042> I don't want people using them
[09:06:46] <gibson042> documentation aside, that is the core of my position
[09:06:51] <DaveMethvin> maybe a secret handshake :)
[09:07:34] <DaveMethvin> i don't mind them being there and don't think we need to remove, but don't want to document something that doesn't follow our api conventions
[09:07:57] <timmywil> ok, well that's 3 votes to leave as-is.
[09:08:01] <DaveMethvin> so i think that leads my opinion to exactly where we are today :)
[09:08:09] <DaveMethvin> yay, no work!
[09:08:11] <timmywil> I think that's majority
[09:09:22] <timmywil> I'll hold off on discussing https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2458 since m_gol isn't here
[09:09:42] <DaveMethvin> i have been meaning to get the Migrate tickets organized and see what needs to be done there, sorry about the delay
[09:09:50] <DaveMethvin> lazy summer Dave
[09:10:41] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: thanks

[09:12:08] <timmywil> The big thing today is the blog post.
[09:12:33] <timmywil> Everything else is prepared for release.
[09:12:43] <DaveMethvin> looking now at the blog post
[09:13:14] <timmywil> We can discuss in the doc and in -dev.
[09:13:43] <timmywil> See? Quick meeting. :D
[09:13:48] <DaveMethvin> yay
