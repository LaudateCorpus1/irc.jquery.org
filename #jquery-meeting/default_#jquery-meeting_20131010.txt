[08:01:54] <jzaefferer> QUnit/Testing meeting! Ping Krinkle m_gol scott_gonzalez arschmitz
[08:02:08] <jzaefferer> apparently James isn't around
[08:02:35] <jzaefferer> Agenda: http://bit.ly/qunitci
[08:03:07] <Krinkle> Hi
[08:03:49] <Krinkle> I'm currently working on splitting src. Rebased an old branch, mostly need to figure out which build process we'll use (currently makig it mostly like in jqui using grunt concat)
[08:03:57] <Krinkle> then I'll rebase assert on that
[08:04:14] <jzaefferer> Nice, sounds good
[08:04:32] <jzaefferer> There should be a very fast running 'build' task for 'grunt watch'
[08:04:37] <jzaefferer> To do the concat
[08:05:31] <Krinkle> yeah
[08:06:02] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I suppose it's fine to depend on grunt to have a working test, right? we an use dist/qunit.js in test/html or do we want to use the raw files there somehow?
[08:06:43] <jzaefferer> I think we can follow what jQuery (Core) does
[08:06:53] <jzaefferer> That's a better reference than UI
[08:07:19] <Krinkle> ok
[08:07:29] <Krinkle> except for the custom build, plain concat should be sufficient
[08:08:18] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's basically what Core does: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/jquery.js#L54
[08:08:25] <JamesMGreene> yo
[08:08:28] <JamesMGreene> What'd I miss?
[08:08:35] <jzaefferer> hey James
[08:08:44] <JamesMGreene> (Sorry, triple tasking right now :))
[08:09:28] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: any updates from your end?
[08:10:10] <JamesMGreene> Nothing beyond my rogue check-in to the phantomjs plugin
[08:10:18] <JamesMGreene> Still cleaning up the side project
[08:10:30] <JamesMGreene> cleaning = finishing
[08:11:32] <jzaefferer> Okay
[08:12:32] <jzaefferer> I don't have anything either
[08:12:43] <jzaefferer> Thanks Krinkle. Looking forward to those PRs
[08:20:36] <JamesMGreene> (Just read through the chat logs.)  Yes, me too!
[11:00:17] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:00:26] <agcolom> Hi :-)
[11:00:45] <uGoMobi> hey agcolom
[11:00:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: feeling better already?
[11:00:57] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:01:09] <agcolom> I'm so ill :-( and hurt my back while coughing :-(
[11:01:26] <arschmitz> agcolom: awww no fun!
[11:01:29] <uGoMobi> aii
[11:02:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you here?
[11:03:01] <_|Nix|_> I'm here!
[11:03:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Ouch! Try to relax ...
[11:03:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we will just have a short meeting, but don't feel obligated to stay if you feel sick
[11:04:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: of course happy to have you here
[11:04:15] <uGoMobi> just saying
[11:04:17] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:04:26] <uGoMobi> ok let's start
[11:04:43] <uGoMobi> agenda / updates https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jWoPx3nOYmvLb82YTBJiPsToFb4fKm39kFYBcAFkh0Q/edit?usp=sharing
[11:04:46] <kborchers> arschmitz: you're at a conference, PAY ATTENTION!
[11:04:47] <kborchers> :P
[11:04:52] <arschmitz> lol
[11:04:54] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:05:06] <uGoMobi> kborchers: looks like you are distracted too ;)
[11:05:13] <kborchers> shhhhhh
[11:05:24] <uGoMobi> 1.4 RC release
[11:05:34] <uGoMobi> sorry if I wasn't really clear last week
[11:05:59] <uGoMobi> what I meant was that I wanted to discuss today when we are going to release 1.4 RC 1
[11:06:28] <uGoMobi> we only have a few open tickets left https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=20&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:06:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You had something for the nested list demo, right?
[11:06:53] <_|Nix|_> ... IIRC ...
[11:07:06] <arschmitz> yes i have a repo wit the code
[11:07:20] <arschmitz> just need to make a page in demos for it
[11:07:24] <uGoMobi> but we are still working on updating API docs, demos, ThemeRoller, Download Builder and new web site
[11:07:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that's right! Now I remember - I actually made a PR against it ...
[11:07:42] <arschmitz> yup
[11:08:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Staying in beta has been a good idea as we work through the demos/API docs, because we could push a lot of fixes we discovered along the way.
[11:08:22] <uGoMobi> I think that as long as we are not almost finished we should stay on beta
[11:08:32] <uGoMobi> exactly
[11:08:59] <uGoMobi> but no need to say that all of us want to have 1.4 final out as soon as possible
[11:09:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you have an idea about how much API docs update work there is still left to do?
[11:10:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *sigh* ... probably a lot. We still don't have docs for navigator, path, navigate event, AFAIK.
[11:10:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've been concentrating on the widgets mostly - so far.
[11:10:40] <uGoMobi> I understand
[11:10:55] <_|Nix|_> I could really use a second pair of eyes on the whole thing.
[11:10:58] <uGoMobi> I think the demos are getting close
[11:11:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im happy to help
[11:11:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Please ... just looking over the whole thing and spotting the glaring gaps would already be a whole pile of help.
[11:12:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we really dont "need" to document navigator and nagivgate stuff its mostly internal and by not documenting yet if we decide to adjust when we re look at navigation api its easier
[11:12:04] <uGoMobi> I suggest that we look at those last open tickets the next few days and then act like we are on RC already
[11:12:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:12:45] <uGoMobi> with that I mean that we only fix big bugs we run into while updating docs/demos, but otherwise don't make changes anymore
[11:13:01] <uGoMobi> just focus on getting the docs in shape
[11:13:16] <arschmitz> not sure how you guys feel but personally i think it would be ok to document as little as possible when it comes to pagecontainer and navigation stuff
[11:13:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've already pretty much been operating in that mode for the past two weeks.
[11:13:34] <uGoMobi> great
[11:13:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am fine with that, we can always add more later
[11:13:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... I've already added pagecontainer. We can shelve it though ...
[11:14:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we need some of it
[11:14:10] <arschmitz> because of deprecation
[11:14:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[11:14:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: True.
[11:14:22] <arschmitz> but would only like to document the parts needed by that
[11:14:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I don't have the back/forward/go methods yet - now that you mention it ...
[11:14:39] <arschmitz> i want to keep as much flexability in nav api as possible for now
[11:15:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ and arschmitz: if you guys can focus on API docs I will focus on ThemeRoller update and new web site
[11:15:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats fine with me
[11:15:47] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:15:48] <uGoMobi> I haven't seen or heard from RWhitbeck the last weeks so I don't think he is working on it
[11:16:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah seems that way
[11:16:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im happy to help with site if you need to just let me know if / when you need anything
[11:16:35] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:16:49] <uGoMobi> I already made that document which says what needs to be done
[11:17:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah you shared with me last week i think
[11:17:08] <uGoMobi> so I will just do the things that are needed to go live
[11:17:23] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWN1UAncQHcmDfy9UuD_ftMtyhQhWiq3inYm0ReE-J8/edit
[11:18:54] <uGoMobi> actually I think I can manage the new web site myself, but the ThemeRoller update... uhh
[11:19:02] <uGoMobi> might need some help with that
[11:19:37] <uGoMobi> started to work on that, but still don't know how everything works exactly
[11:19:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iv never really done much with themeroller honestly but i can dig in and try and help if you can point me in the right direction with what you need
[11:19:56] <uGoMobi> I wish we were using a preprocessor and just set some vars :)
[11:20:03] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah
[11:21:29] <uGoMobi> so RC release... maybe end of next week?
[11:21:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sounds good!
[11:21:49] <arschmitz> works for me
[11:22:00] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:22:00] <_|Nix|_> Barring major disasters, of course ...
[11:22:06] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:22:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That back button thing - 1.4.1?
[11:22:49] <arschmitz> yeah it needs more thought and testing then we should do or have time for now
[11:22:54] <arschmitz> and its not a regression
[11:23:05] <uGoMobi> I think that everything that isn't a blocker issue should be moved to 1.4.1
[11:23:24] <_|Nix|_> OK. That's definitely in that category.
[11:23:30] <uGoMobi> otherwise 1.4 final will become a Christmas present ;-)
[11:23:41] <arschmitz> lol yeah lets avoid that
[11:23:51] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[11:23:51] <uGoMobi> oh, there was one PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6584
[11:23:52] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #6584 by dylanb (21h 11m ago): jquery.mobile.tabele.reflow.js: removed the display: table-row-group; css. Fixes 6583. This display property causes assistive technology like VoiceOver to no longer detect the table as a table.
[11:24:00] <_|Nix|_> Let's make it a Halloween present ....
[11:24:17] <uGoMobi> Oct 31 right?
[11:24:23] <arschmitz> yes
[11:24:23] <uGoMobi> sounds better
[11:24:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[11:24:44] <uGoMobi> that PR reverts a fix
[11:24:48] <_|Nix|_> ... which is not to say that 1.4.0 is scary ...
[11:24:48] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: I am not in that.
[11:24:52] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:24:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have not really looked too too close at that pr yet
[11:24:59] <uGoMobi> I did
[11:25:13] <uGoMobi> it reverts a fix for Safari 5 on OS X
[11:25:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok whats your thought?
[11:25:33] <uGoMobi> because that fix made table inaccessible for screen readers
[11:25:56] <uGoMobi> my thought it is that we should first look into other fix
[11:26:04] <arschmitz> funny timing for that...
[11:26:08] <uGoMobi> if no other solution, that we can merge the PR
[11:26:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yea
[11:26:23] <uGoMobi> BTW - didn't check CLA yet
[11:26:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok i think that PR should maybe stay until after final
[11:26:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:27:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is it a regression in 1.4 or was it that way in 1.4?
[11:27:10] <arschmitz> 1.3
[11:27:22] <uGoMobi> I also don't know if that issue was only on Safari on OS X or also Mobile Safari on iOS5
[11:27:36] <uGoMobi> regression from 1.3 I think
[11:27:43] <arschmitz> oh.....
[11:27:49] <uGoMobi> Wilto committed the fix
[11:28:02] <uGoMobi> so it has been a while ago
[11:28:04] <arschmitz> so it was that way in 1.3 then?
[11:28:09] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:28:11] <arschmitz> or 1.3.2 at least
[11:28:18] <arschmitz> ahh ok so not a regression in 1.4
[11:28:38] <arschmitz> regressions we should fix for 1.4 bugs can wait for 1.4.1
[11:28:56] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380
[11:28:56] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5380 by agcolom (9mon 3w ago): Bug with Table reflow on Safari
[11:29:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you added item to the agenda
[11:29:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah 1.3.0 so that can wait if we are unsure
[11:29:52] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[11:30:11] <agcolom> I can check if I still have ios 5 somewhere
[11:30:17] <_|Nix|_> The Samsung guys asked me to bring this up: Are there any widgets we want them to code for post-1.4.0?
[11:30:22] <agcolom> I think I do (kids)
[11:30:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great
[11:30:26] <arschmitz> agcolom: i do on ipad and iphone so i can check it out
[11:30:35] <_|Nix|_> They would reside in web-ui-fw for now ...
[11:30:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thing with new widgets is really they should go in ui not mobile
[11:31:02] <arschmitz> and we should considder this as part of roadmap
[11:31:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh definitely. I told them that any new widgets have to interoperate with UI.
[11:31:10] <uGoMobi> right
[11:31:42] <uGoMobi> I suggest we make this part of our roadmap discussion
[11:31:58] <_|Nix|_> The reason I bring it up is that they offered their help already, so it would be good to get them working on some desirable widgets which would be "UI-grade" right off the bat.
[11:31:59] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sorry if you've already mentioned it (I may have missed it), but before we release 1.4 and the new site, we need the changelog and the upgrade guide
[11:32:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah
[11:32:34] <_|Nix|_> We need not merge them into the library, but it would help get web-ui-fw to UI-grade as well.
[11:32:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am taking care of the upgrade guide
[11:32:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: i already have a changelog script similar to ui
[11:32:47] <agcolom> great.
[11:32:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: arschmitz made that script work to generate a complete changelog
[11:32:56] <arschmitz> we just need to tweak it for our use
[11:33:14] <_|Nix|_> So, if you guys know of any popular widgets out there, they can get started.
[11:33:14] <agcolom> ok, that's fine. hopefully I'll be operational again soon ;-)
[11:33:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: problem is this would need to be added to ui roadmap also
[11:33:35] <uGoMobi> yeah hope you feel better soon agcolom
[11:33:43] <agcolom> thanks! :-)
[11:33:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so we really need to discuss this with them also
[11:34:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the only new widget that I hade in mind is maybe a  carousel that works with swipe
[11:34:34] <uGoMobi> but we have to discuss with UI indeed
[11:34:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not bad.
[11:35:11] <agcolom> the carousel on swipe is also what I was thinking about
[11:35:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Alright. I'll relay the message.
[11:36:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have to move web-ui-fw up to 1.4.0 anyway, and we have the existing widgets to worry about, so there's plenty of work to go around with that.
[11:36:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but if they are going to work on something we should have a meeting together with the UI people to discuss what it should look like
[11:36:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool its not that we dont want help we just dont know on what yet ...
[11:37:00] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[11:37:24] <uGoMobi> and I don't like it when people work hard on something and expect it to land, but then we say no thanks or something
[11:37:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: EXACTLY!
[11:37:40] <arschmitz> thats a good way to lose your help
[11:37:49] <uGoMobi> or it has to be done completely different
[11:38:46] <agcolom> btw, I've been invited to talk at jQuery UK about jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile (project updates, directions, etc. )
[11:38:47] <uGoMobi> good way to start is with a document that describes what it is going to look like and how it will work
[11:38:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: oh great!
[11:39:14] <agcolom> It's in May, so we've got time :-)
[11:39:22] <uGoMobi> right :)
[11:39:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: All true.
[11:39:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: something like that https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFD_Y9QuuMTI4NOc-JQYRjPTrcVV52h7ZeLKLPbSj40/edit
[11:39:44] <uGoMobi> you are a great speaker, I understand they already "booked" you
[11:39:57] <arschmitz> that way the api options etc cal all be finalized BEFORE coding starts
[11:40:03] <agcolom> Oh thanks ;-)
[11:40:31] <arschmitz> agcolom: i didnt even know it had been announced yet lol
[11:41:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[11:42:54] <uGoMobi> ok, anything else we need to discuss here?
[11:43:27] <uGoMobi> any questions from people that are following this meeting?
[11:44:11] <uGoMobi> looks like we are ready here :)
[11:44:17] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:44:22] <_|Nix|_> Alright - to the -dev cave!
[11:44:23] <agcolom> Thx :-)
[11:44:24] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:44:27] <_|Nix|_> L8R
