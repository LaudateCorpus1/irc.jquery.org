[09:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: arschmitz fnagel gnarf kborchers mikesherov rxaviers_ tj_vantoll
[09:00:08] <rxaviers_> hello
[09:00:20] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:22] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything to discuss for button this week?
[09:02:36] <arschmitz> nothing new just waiting for feedback on the updates from jzaefferer comments and on the proposed controlgroup api in the wiki
[09:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:04:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything on Globalize?
[09:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> I saw the issue with the request for locale-specific instances.
[09:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like that'd be pretty useful.
[09:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/234
[09:05:57] <rxaviers> I agree. The original Globalize supported it. 1.x should as well.
[09:06:51] <rxaviers> On regard of the docs improvement PR fix, Im waiting on the review of the respective bug owners
[09:07:07] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: right, gonna make a note of that, should have more feedback for you soon
[09:07:29] <rxaviers> ragulka has opened several issues today. Really cool. It seems most of them are asking new features.
[09:07:34] <rxaviers> asking for*
[09:08:12] <rxaviers> This one is tricky
[09:08:13] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/231#issuecomment-40584778
[09:08:55] <rxaviers> He is interested on using a Globalize's private method.
[09:08:59] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: regarding the issue: this feature is documented on the wiki page, see last point on "1. Decription"
[09:10:19] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: feedback on the controlgroup api would be most helpfull
[09:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you link to the code that does the parsing?
[09:11:11] <rxaviers> Sure
[09:11:30] <jzaefferer> Should have a way to create a new local globalize object by `var g = Globalize( "fr" );`
[09:11:40] <jzaefferer> I think that's what fnagel was referring to
[09:11:48] <rxaviers> Globalize.formatNumber public is this one https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/number.js#L21
[09:11:50] <fnagel> jzaefferer: right
[09:11:52] <jzaefferer> That's currently not implemented?
[09:12:08] <rxaviers> that calls this https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/number/format.js#L29
[09:12:18] <rxaviers> He is interested on this function https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/number/format.js#L41
[09:12:35] <rxaviers> which is defined here https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/number/format.js#L41
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I'm not sure what you're referring to.
[09:13:40] <rxaviers> It's a function that parses stuff like ##.###,00 and convert it into https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/number/format/properties.js#L88-L98
[09:13:44] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: like joern said, this feature request https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/234 should be implemented as its documented in the wiki
[09:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the UI wiki. That page should probably be deleted.
[09:14:27] <fnagel> hehe
[09:14:51] <rxaviers> wait is fnagel ragulka?
[09:15:05] <rxaviers> or it just happen to fnagel and ragulka both requested https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/234?
[09:15:23] <rxaviers> happened*
[09:15:35] <jzaefferer> neither
[09:15:39] <fnagel> no, I just wanted to point out this feature is documented in the wiki
[09:16:03] <rxaviers> oh ok
[09:16:24] <rxaviers> in which url?
[09:16:38] <jzaefferer> here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39118647/Globalize
[09:16:57] <fnagel> 1. Description, Some goals, last bullet point
[09:16:57] <rxaviers> oh ok thanks
[09:17:18] <rxaviers> yeap, that doc may refer to 0.x code
[09:17:21] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to deleting that page?
[09:19:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: can you review that wiki page to see if there's anything of value there?
[09:19:19] <jzaefferer> If so, create an issue on the Globalize repo; then, either way, delete the page
[09:20:37] <rxaviers> from what I see, everything in the wiki was in Globalize source somehow
[09:20:49] <rxaviers> Functional Specifications was in the former README
[09:21:03] <rxaviers> keywords were in package.json
[09:21:25] <rxaviers> Listed Goals have been accomplished or has no relation to current Globalize.
[09:22:57] <rxaviers> One think we should do in Globalize is start testing across browsers
[09:23:12] <rxaviers> For that I guess I'd need jzaefferer's help
[09:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> We can create a project in TestSwarm.
[09:23:44] <jzaefferer> Let's try browserstack-runner for that
[09:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:26:12] <rxaviers> great! :D
[09:27:02] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what's with all the extra files here? https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/224/files
[09:27:32] <rxaviers> extra?
[09:27:44] <jzaefferer> doc/api/*
[09:27:49] <jzaefferer> doc/hello-world/*
[09:28:10] <rxaviers> README links to them
[09:28:45] <rxaviers> This way, we have a concise README while letting users to navigate into details
[09:29:02] <scott_gonzalez> We should have a standard API site.
[09:29:02] <rxaviers> new README https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/fix-218-getting-started/README.md
[09:29:29] <rxaviers> Sure, once we have that, we could move all that into API site.
[09:29:39] <rxaviers> It'd be awesome
[09:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> We should just start there.
[09:30:29] <rxaviers> What are the steps?
[09:30:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah css will need one eventually too
[09:30:53] <jzaefferer> buy http://globalize.com/ ?
[09:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let's not go down the road of what domain to buy in this meeting.
[09:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> The steps are figuring out the domain, creating a site in jquery-wp-content, and creating the API docs in an api.whatever.com repo.
[09:33:06] <rxaviers> People are urging on docs (as we can see with the recent opened issues, #206, #210, #218, #225, ...).
[09:33:13] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/236
[09:33:33] <rxaviers> I'd love to have an API site. I can start working on that, np.
[09:33:48] <jzaefferer> The docs PR as is looks pretty good. We can merge that before starting to work on a separate site
[09:34:34] <rxaviers> cool. I think having that docs in place now is good for our users.
[09:36:25] <jzaefferer> Let's move on
[09:36:27] <jzaefferer> Selectmenu...
[09:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> Is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1224 good to land?
[09:37:25] <fnagel> ok for me
[09:37:41] <jzaefferer> "Regarding the label for change: sounds reasonable but needs testing. I'm not sure if this was needed to prevent the default behavior but it's possible it's just a leftover." - fnagel did you test that?
[09:38:18] <fnagel> no, scott wanted to try something
[09:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Can you test using aria-labelledby instead of for?
[09:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> See what happens if you leave the for attribute pointing at the original select.
[09:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> But keep the handler that moves the focus.
[09:39:54] <fnagel> ok
[09:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for selectmenu?
[09:41:53] <jzaefferer> fnagel: also, would you look into creating a demo ala "Shopping cart with dropdowns for color and size" - maybe not quite that usecase, but something that's more a demo, not just visual test case
[09:42:24] <jzaefferer> maybe size and rim type for tires
[09:43:16] <fnagel> ok, replacing the old default demo completly?
[09:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> Add it as a new demo.
[09:44:39] <fnagel> just two selects with meaingful options and thats it?
[09:45:30] <jzaefferer> they should have some sort of effect, like the color dropdown here: http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/web/dropdownlist/index.html
[09:46:40] <fnagel> perhaps tires are not that perfect ;-)
[09:47:23] <jzaefferer> sure sure
[09:48:07] <jzaefferer> tapesty? 2m, 5m, 10m, 20m in red, blue or green, along with a box that changes color according to the second dropdown
[09:48:12] <jzaefferer> *tapestry
[09:49:12] <tj_vantoll> Radius and color of a circle maybe?
[09:50:07] <fnagel> Do we use images for demos like that or using some CSS?
[09:50:25] <fnagel> tj_vantoll: I like that idea!
[09:51:05] <jzaefferer> that works and won't need images
[09:51:23] <fnagel> perfect
[09:51:31] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I'd try to avoid images when possible.
[09:52:16] <jzaefferer> Alright, Release
[09:52:38] <jzaefferer> hoping for rxaviers to confirm this is good to land: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/203
[09:53:08] <jzaefferer> otherwise Scott was looking at the rather useless variables created here: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/7ebbb8ff82dfcfd974579130275d3929febd7c05/lib/builder.1.11.0.js#L85-L86 - suggesting to remove those
[09:53:09] <rxaviers> Although it's simple, I think I will be able to do it by the end of today or tomorrow morning, ok?
[09:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Which thing are you referring to?
[09:55:42] <rxaviers> DB #203
[09:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> What do you think about removing the vars?
[09:57:28] <rxaviers> Sure, if they are unused vars, I agree they should be removed.
[09:57:46] <jzaefferer> Ticket for that: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/204
[09:58:26] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: would be great to get both addressed today
[09:58:30] <rxaviers> added it to my TODO, sorry not having noticed it before
[09:58:51] <jzaefferer> Both are pretty fresh :-)
[09:59:10] <jzaefferer> did you ever get an update from gseguin about the CSS builder module?
[09:59:23] <rxaviers> Yes, gseguin decoupled it.
[09:59:28] <gseguin> jzaefferer: I decoupled it last week
[09:59:31] <rxaviers> Ball is with me
[10:00:01] <rxaviers> Regarding this, I have a couple of questions
[10:00:09] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/44c6f7c785771069f6cd30f89a28abcc06bbdab7
[10:00:13] <rxaviers> to the team
[10:00:25] <rxaviers> arschmitz and scott_gonzalez answered part of it
[10:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm mostly staying out of this discussion.
[10:01:37] <jzaefferer> looks to me like each file needs to include both theme.css and base.css
[10:02:49] <rxaviers> does staying out of the discussion mean whatever works is fine to me?
[10:03:29] <jzaefferer> I think it means that he wants someone else to figure it out
[10:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: yes
[10:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to avoid all discussions related to AMD/Bower/whatever.
[10:05:05] <rxaviers> hehe ok
[10:05:31] * gseguin thinks s/discussions/arguments/
[10:05:46] <gseguin> ;)
[10:06:24] <jzaefferer> Looks like that's all for today
[10:06:28] <rxaviers> well ok, we can move that discussion into -dev or github
[10:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
