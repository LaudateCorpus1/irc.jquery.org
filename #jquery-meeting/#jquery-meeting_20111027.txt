[12:09:11] <eddiemonge> themeroller looks to be on track for an official release for tomorrow
[12:17:13] <Wilto> We generally disagree with Henry Ford’s stance that “you can have any color dialog backdrop you want, as long as it’s black” and plan to make that an option in the user’s theme(s).
[12:23:59] <eddiemonge> appcache was added to docs but maybe could use some work
[12:24:19] <eddiemonge> something something something isLocal something
[12:24:20] <Wilto> As is the way of all matters appcache.
[12:27:09] <eddiemonge> there are some issues or needsDoc for scrolling with iOS to hide the url bar
[12:27:32] <Wilto> We also have some PhoneGap implementation notes in the works.
[12:28:08] <eddiemonge> its been determined that toddparker can spek well and make words appear eloquently
[12:28:09] <Wilto> Todd Parker wanted to write them all in iambic pentameter; this was promptly vetoed.
[12:29:48] <eddiemonge> It would be nice to have a search tool for the docs in the code until an actual docs site comes online
[12:30:38] <Wilto> It’s probably time to start the drumroll for ThemeRoller, is all we are collectively saying.
[12:32:47] <eddiemonge> IE has issues and work arounds are tough or non-existent
[12:34:50] <Wilto> BREAKING: Internet Explorer is still wacky.
[12:35:14] <kinblas> heh
[12:38:00] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2588
[12:38:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2588 on jquery-mobile, reported by awoni (3w, 5d ago): Windows Phone 7.5 native select menu problem
[12:38:24] <eddiemonge> changing one css property to make it work on one device often breaks other devices
[12:38:24] <eddiemonge> some CSS fixes make no sense whatsoever but whatevs
[12:39:43] <Wilto> toddparker intends to bribe a certain specific team member with delicious baked goods in return for fixing bizarre CSS bugs.
[12:39:47] <Wilto> I have agreed.
[12:39:54] <Wilto> —He. He has agreed.
[12:41:05] <eddiemonge> kinblas: is great testing performance
[12:41:19] <eddiemonge> there should be a "for" somewhere in that sentence
[12:41:45] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, you have a link to this emulator setup handy?
[12:42:16] <johnbender> Wilto: you have to download VS and then service pack 1 and then the sdk
[12:42:34] <johnbender> once that's done you just create a vs project for win phone 7
[12:42:34] <Wilto> But at what cost to my mortal soul?
[12:42:54] <wesbos> remember i got a high res logo emailed to me via MS word? Happening again http://wes.io/BKxG
[12:42:55] <johnbender> Wilto: espensive
[12:43:30] <Wilto> wesbos: WE ARE HAVING A MEETING HERE. GOD.
[12:43:40] <wesbos> Crap sorry guys wrong room!
[12:43:55] <johnbender> :P
[12:43:57] <Wilto> BREAKING: wesbos ruins meetings/everything.
[12:44:11] <eddiemonge> he does
[12:44:14] <wesbos> *scampers away*
[12:48:26] <eddiemonge> people need to remember mobile devices are under-powered computers
[12:48:32] <eddiemonge> especially blackberries
[12:48:39] <Wilto> (Burn.)
[12:48:49] <eddiemonge> so forgive the page transitions
[12:49:26] <eddiemonge> most other frameworks look "faster" because they have carefully curated examples that are highly optimized
[12:49:48] <eddiemonge> where jqm throw something out there that was designed to seriously stress the heck out of devices
[12:50:50] <Wilto> Yeah. We’re also gonna start writing up more known quirks, as we tend to see a lot of “adding this one transform/style/etc. makes everything better” solutions kicking around in the wild which may be highly specific to that user’s setup.
[12:51:28] <johnbender> Wilto: I hate these "I wrote my own mobile framework" folks
[12:51:37] <johnbender> because they test on two devices and declare victory
[12:51:37] <Wilto> All that said: there are major performance improvements in the works.
[12:52:05] <Wilto> True that, man. “I don’t see why this city is taking so long to build—I made a spice rack in like ten minutes.”
[12:54:35] <eddiemonge> android is like the ie7 of mobile devices?
[12:54:46] <eddiemonge> isnt windows phone 7 the ie7 of mobile devices?
[12:55:21] <Wilto> Androids! How do they work? Magnets, probably.
[12:55:52] <Wilto> I give Android a solid 7.5 IEs.
[12:56:03] <Wilto> Maybe eight. Depends on the day.
[12:56:34] <eddiemonge> plugins can be used to patch stuff for now and pulled into core post 1.0
[12:58:29] <eddiemonge> perceived performance is just as important as actual performance, maybe even more so
[12:58:53] <eddiemonge> "make it fast", even if it doesnt work
[12:59:01] <eddiemonge> but if it does work, woohoo!
[12:59:20] <Wilto> Looks like one of the biggest places where there’s potential for improvement to both is with page enhancement—finding elements and enhancing them at the time the page is pulled in.
[12:59:40] <eddiemonge> toddparker is going to fix all problems with dialogs
[13:00:09] <eddiemonge> he who logs it, deals w/ it
[13:00:40] <Wilto> toddparker is going to fix all problems with d̶i̶a̶l̶o̶g̶s̶ everything.
[13:01:34] <eddiemonge> how did you do a strikethrough?
[13:01:53] <Wilto> (Unicode character.  ̶ )
[13:02:12] <eddiemonge> iOS only looks fast. its not actually fast. <- perceived performance
[13:02:41] <eddiemonge> "how can we match that?"
[13:02:50] <Wilto> iOS does make use of some clever transition patterns to boost perceived performance.
[13:03:36] <johnbender> internet is getting spotty here
[13:03:48] <eddiemonge> Does that mean android appears slow because it actually works?
[13:04:10] <johnbender> eddiemonge: hard to know but it's possible
[13:04:12] <Wilto> Things that make the page feel more reactive, and there are definitely cues we can take from their approach. Not a pre-1.0 thing, but something to think about.
[13:05:11] <eddiemonge> anything thats super annoying should be fixed
[13:05:24] <eddiemonge> anything that can be made faster, kick it
[13:05:46] <eddiemonge> on to the important issue everyone cares about: timing!
[13:06:13] <Wilto> Team members will be required to get one or both of these phrases as tattoos.
[13:06:20] <eddiemonge> johnbender doesnt care and only a small subset do care
[13:06:50] <Wilto> Fixes and optimizations are the name of the game, leading up to 1.0.
[13:07:06] <johnbender> eddiemonge: with regards to the small fixes that may have triggered another rc
[13:07:06] <eddiemonge> sounds like another RC is not needed as their havent been major breaking changes
[13:07:15] <johnbender> ^^
[13:07:16] <johnbender> bingo
[13:07:34] <eddiemonge> Wilto has to fix everything style related
[13:07:38] <eddiemonge> and performance related
[13:07:41] <eddiemonge> and everything else
[13:07:49] <Wilto> BREAKING: Wilto has retired from professional web design.
[13:08:26] <eddiemonge> 1.0 will definitely be out by mid-November
[13:08:29] <eddiemonge> ...maybe
[13:09:18] <eddiemonge> because Microsoft is stingy
[13:09:24] <eddiemonge> just like Google
[13:09:30] <eddiemonge> jk. they are both awesome
[13:09:34] <Wilto> In This Economy™.
[13:10:00] <eddiemonge> blackberries are like blackberries. they are all the same device anyway
[13:10:45] <eddiemonge> and that concludes Wilto's and eddiemonge's weekly comedy routine
[13:11:15] <gseguin> lol
