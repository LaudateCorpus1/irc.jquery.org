[12:03:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhcW9_TlSwD8JnO1_HNnSYJAriTK9WYZ8uQNDvtAAhA/edit
[12:03:37] <timmywil> thanks for fixing the milestones, m_gol
[12:03:52] <timmywil> If you could put together a list of the ones you fixed, I can add them to the changelog in the blog post
[12:03:59] <m_gol> sure
[12:04:03] <DaveMethvin> hallo!
[12:04:16] <m_gol> I added the same comment to all of them so they should be easy to find
[12:04:30] <timmywil> great
[12:04:35] <m_gol> we might want to optionally think about not generating the changelog
[12:04:43] <m_gol> but just posting a link to the GitHub milestone
[12:04:56] <timmywil> yea, I do that for patch releases
[12:04:59] <m_gol> those lists got really long, I doubt people are reading that from the blog post
[12:05:14] <m_gol> especially that to know more you need to click on the GitHub link anyway
[12:05:24] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: thoughts? I figured there was a reason we included the full changelog in the blog post.
[12:05:58] <timmywil> maybe scott_gonzalez? we're generating it in jquery-release
[12:06:06] <DaveMethvin> i prob did it because jresig did
[12:06:15] <m_gol> :)
[12:06:17] <timmywil> heh, yea
[12:06:22] <timmywil> so it's tradition
[12:06:28] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we need to, i've been linking to the github issues for Migrate
[12:06:47] <DaveMethvin> just pointing out the highlights in the blog posts
[12:06:48] <timmywil> it's pretty easy to link to a tag compare
[12:06:50] <m_gol> you now reeeeally need to scroll a lot to go from the post to comments to scroll through that enormous 1.12.0/2.2.0 list
[12:07:03] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: or just to a milestone
[12:07:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> I've never put the changelog in a blog post for UI.
[12:07:17] <m_gol> like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=milestone%3A1.12.0%2F2.2.0+is%3Aclosed
[12:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> We maintain them on jqueryui.com
[12:07:34] <timmywil> tag compare is sure to be accurate, but we might have missed a milestone assignment
[12:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/changelog/
[12:08:01] <timmywil> interesting
[12:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> To be honest, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=milestone%3A1.12.0%2F2.2.0+is%3Aclosed is a pretty shitty changelog view
[12:09:18] <timmywil> it is. it's just a relevant issues view.
[12:09:36] <timmywil> which is not really a changelog
[12:09:47] <m_gol> ok, a tag compare might be better then
[12:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> Tag compare will be equally annoying as a changelog.
[12:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> But it's up to you what you want to do.
[12:10:16] <timmywil> heh, equally?
[12:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> It will have some things that are better and some things that are worse.
[12:10:45] <arschmitz> mobile just puts change log on website linked too
[12:10:45] <m_gol> maybe we can just move it to a separate page like for UI
[12:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> It will be very noisy.
[12:10:57] <m_gol> then we can modify it afterwards without touching the blog
[12:11:17] <timmywil> seems like the only difference is that it's not ordered by component
[12:11:27] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: our generated changelog is already really noisy
[12:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> They're not just groups.
[12:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> They're filtered.
[12:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> And the messages are massaged when necessary.
[12:11:42] <m_gol> jut look at http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/08/jquery-2-2-and-1-12-released/
[12:11:54] <m_gol> ours isn't filtered
[12:11:57] <arschmitz> we go through the changelog and clean it up by hand  after its generated
[12:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, I've never thought core had good changelogs.
[12:12:31] <m_gol> :)
[12:12:36] <timmywil> it took hours to split up the changelogs for 1.12/2.2
[12:12:42] <timmywil> filtering even further would have taken longer
[12:12:49] <DaveMethvin> well that was a bad time all around
[12:12:55] <timmywil> rather, combining into common commits
[12:13:07] <arschmitz> we combine groups remove things like build stuff that not relevant etc dont just use the raw output avoids things like a CSS group and a css group
[12:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> If you value your time during a release over the cumulative time and value of the entire community doing upgrades, that's your choice.
[12:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> As I said, it's your project, you can do what you want.
[12:13:36] <timmywil> man, you're ruthless
[12:13:40] <DaveMethvin> i guess the question is what format is going to help people figure out what changed that affects them
[12:13:56] <timmywil> I value getting the release out
[12:14:20] <DaveMethvin> you can look at each ticket and try to analyze its effect on upgraders but we never guess the right things there anyway
[12:14:29] <timmywil> I doubt many people actually read the generated changelogs
[12:14:35] <DaveMethvin> me too
[12:14:45] <arschmitz> to a user component is likely to be the most valuable thing to order by it gives them a starting place at least
[12:15:21] <DaveMethvin> well 1.12/2.2 was a worst case since we waited a long time to release, a typical release isn't going to be that big
[12:15:35] <DaveMethvin> and it shoudl be easier to find the issue affecting someone
[12:15:44] <timmywil> agreed
[12:15:49] <arschmitz> in addition to a change log on ui and mobile we do an upgrade guide
[12:15:51] <m_gol> yeah, we can try to make it better in 3.0
[12:16:02] <m_gol> but, still, I'd create a changelog page like UI has
[12:16:18] <timmywil> I think the migrate plugin is even more helpful than an upgrade guide
[12:16:22] <m_gol> not sure what to do about old changelogs
[12:16:54] <DaveMethvin> going back and changing that seems like make-work
[12:17:04] <DaveMethvin> if someone wanted to do it great but meh
[12:17:27] <timmywil> I want to spend time on things people care about
[12:17:52] <DaveMethvin> i can't recall the changelogs being a problem
[12:18:14] <timmywil> Even filtering doesn't provide enough transparency to make it friendly
[12:18:54] <DaveMethvin> we did a pretty extensive upgrade guide for 1.9 and still got lots of questions from people who didn't read it
[12:19:01] <timmywil> although the added, fixed, changed tags are nice
[12:21:01] <DaveMethvin> btw m_gol thanks for cleaning up all the milestones on those issues!
[12:22:01] <m_gol> np :)
[12:22:12] <timmywil> I'd like to see analytics on the changelog page to determine if it's worth it
[12:22:34] <DaveMethvin> so if there's a good time for another upgrade guide it seems like 3.0 would be it, although it will overlap heavily with Migrate messages
[12:22:50] <DaveMethvin> so maybe Migrate should just reference the upgrade guide?
[12:23:01] <m_gol> every major version bump is a moment for an upgrade guide, I guess
[12:23:24] <DaveMethvin> yep
[12:23:31] <timmywil> idk, I prefer Migrate. When I read an upgrade guide, I look for things that pertains to the code I've written
[12:23:40] <timmywil> migrate does that for you
[12:24:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah so i'm proposing that for Migrate 3.0 we move the messages from warnings.md to an upgrade guide page
[12:24:06] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't go back and update previous changelogs UNLESS you know that there are many people still on a specific version and you want to help them upgrade sooner rather than later.
[12:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> But in general, I'd leave the old ones untouched.
[12:26:16] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I wish you'd suggested more manual touch-ups sooner
[12:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> TBH, I assumed the core team never wanted to invest time in this stuff.
[12:27:18] <timmywil> you know what happens when you assume
[12:27:59] <timmywil> anyway, I can try to clean-up the changelog for 3.0 final, but I still don't want to put it in the blog post
[12:28:39] <timmywil> which means a page somewhere
[12:28:43] <DaveMethvin> what is our schedule for final?
[12:28:43] <m_gol> yup
[12:28:54] <timmywil> but I also don't want to have to go back and edit all our previous changelogs
[12:29:02] <DaveMethvin> no way
[12:29:08] <timmywil> so I'd like to just do 3.0 onward
[12:29:17] <DaveMethvin> again that seems like busy work, just do whatever you want for 3.0
[12:30:05] <timmywil> I'm just asking, are we okay with a changelog page that is 3.0+
[12:30:14] <DaveMethvin> sure i'm okay with it
[12:30:34] <timmywil> ok cool
[12:30:51] <timmywil> to answer your question, I'd like to get out 1.12.2/2.2.2 this week
[12:31:03] <timmywil> how's migrate 3.0 coming?
[12:31:19] <DaveMethvin> m_gol just submitted a pr to clean out the old stuff
[12:31:35] <DaveMethvin> i still need to know specifics about the show/hide examples
[12:31:44] <DaveMethvin> to know if we can detect/fix in code
[12:32:05] <DaveMethvin> otherwise the only fix i would come up with is to completely copy/pasta the old code out
[12:32:19] <timmywil> I'll release 3.0 as soon as we can get the Blockers done
[12:32:24] <DaveMethvin> but even then we couldn't warn about the specific cases that are changed
[12:32:28] <DaveMethvin> which i would like to do
[12:32:54] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: best person for that is probably gibson042
[12:33:01] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: I might be able to do that this week, but if not then next
[12:33:07] <DaveMethvin> ok
[12:33:20] <DaveMethvin> in the meantime i can look at the other tickets, there is some easy stuff there
[12:33:23] <timmywil> only 2 blockers. one is more a discussion. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+label%3ABlocker
[12:33:25] <DaveMethvin> if others have time go at it
[12:34:22] <timmywil> both are somewhat dependent on markelog
[12:34:38] <timmywil> but I'm okay with leaving show/hide behavior right now and adding more tests for disconnected in 3.0.1
[12:34:54] <DaveMethvin> dom scripts async would be nice but quite a breaking change
[12:35:16] <DaveMethvin> it would fix some CSP issues tho
[12:35:48] <timmywil> if it takes much longer, we might consider moving to 4.0
[12:36:13] <timmywil> I'd say 3.0 needs to go out by end of March at the latest
[12:36:28] <DaveMethvin> should we have another beta?
[12:36:38] <DaveMethvin> maybe an rc
[12:36:50] <timmywil> right, rc would be good
[12:36:57] <timmywil> but a 2-week rc at most I think
[12:37:27] <DaveMethvin> with no changes other than critical stuff :)
[12:37:27] <timmywil> just don't want to delay too long
[12:37:48] <m_gol> timmywil: is there antything blocking the 1.12.2/2.2.2 release? or just your time to do the release?
[12:37:52] <timmywil> 3.0 final has been in the works for a long time and once it's out, we can do smaller releases.
[12:38:18] <timmywil> m_gol: I just need to write the blog post
[12:38:44] <m_gol> k
[12:38:46] <timmywil> when I say this week, I might get it done today
[12:39:40] <DaveMethvin> we need the upgrade guide avail by then tho, right?
[12:39:57] <timmywil> by the rc?
[12:40:14] <DaveMethvin> i think the api.jquery.com docs are in decent shape but we'd need something to tell folks how to upgrade and what will break
[12:41:39] <timmywil> Fair enough. I suppose I could write that up.
[12:41:50] <DaveMethvin> just looking at the issues now to see what needs to be documented
[12:42:23] <timmywil> we've done a decent job keeping up with that in the 3.0 docs (with some commits already on master)
[12:42:32] <timmywil> s/3.0 docs/3.0-docs version
[12:42:32] <b-ot> Correction, <timmywil> we've done a decent job keeping up with that in the 3.0-docs version (with some commits already on master)
[12:42:46] <DaveMethvin> a lot of these seem to trivial/noisy for an upgrade guide or even a changelog, which is good as far as the amount of work to be done
[12:43:47] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i can start an upgrade guide page on jquery.com for 3.0
[12:44:18] <timmywil> big ones are deferred, non-silent error cases, decimal values, and method removals...I think
[12:44:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: that would be great
[12:44:52] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll just do a pr over there and we can iterate
[12:44:58] <timmywil> sounds good
[12:45:57] <timmywil> got my work cut out for me :)
[12:46:07] <timmywil> anything else for this week?
[12:46:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah this is why i wouldn't do any retroactive stuff, it's gonna be enough work trying to get the new stuff done!
[12:46:28] <DaveMethvin> nothing here
[12:46:59] <timmywil> alright, if we missed something, just add it to the agenda for next time. Thanks all.
[12:46:59] <m_gol> any opinions about my PR?
[12:47:06] <DaveMethvin> whichone?
[12:47:13] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2949
[12:47:21] <timmywil> m_gol: looks great to me
[12:47:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah, no objections here
[12:48:19] <m_gol> we should try to land https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/95
[12:48:21] <timmywil> feel free to land, and we can do further edits later if needed
[12:48:27] <m_gol> even without a redy JSCS plugins
[12:48:32] <m_gol> timmywil: ok, thx
[12:48:38] <m_gol> s/redy/ready/
[12:48:38] <b-ot> Correction, <m_gol> even without a ready JSCS plugins
[12:49:07] <m_gol> it's controversial to some to follow a non-merged guide ;-)
[12:49:18] <timmywil> yup, just need someone to put together the PR
[12:49:32] <m_gol> k
[12:49:47] <timmywil> thanks, see you in -dev
