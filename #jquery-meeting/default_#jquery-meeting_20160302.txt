[12:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> ?uiteam
[12:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[12:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> And there's no b-ot.
[12:02:49] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz  fnagel  jzaefferer
[12:03:00] <fnagel> hey
[12:03:09] <arschmitz> oh i think he may have got killed when the znc server was rebuilt last night
[12:03:26] <arschmitz> it was on same one i think
[12:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[12:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> So, we finally got grunt-html updated.
[12:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/ff3769272bb5530b224297fa5d2add1865acbb7f
[12:05:43] <arschmitz> YAY
[12:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/297 is still pending a merge.
[12:06:06] <arschmitz> oh yeah ill do that sorry forgot it needed to be merged still
[12:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer had started working on the menu regression.
[12:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14919
[12:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> But he pinged me for help and I've been super busy.
[12:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything we really need to discuss today?
[12:09:40] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[12:12:18] <Guest16271> Hello There, This is Ahmed From IBM@Egypt
[12:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, wonderful. You made it.
[12:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> Hi Ahmed.
[12:12:49] <Guest16271> I would like to get your comments regarding our mirroring support of jQueryUI
[12:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> You're hear to discuss RTL, correct?
[12:12:57] <Guest16271> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14923#comment:6
[12:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> s/hear/here/
[12:13:12] <Guest16271> yep
[12:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> So, that specific approach probably falls apart with nested direction changes.
[12:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> I believe we said that was important to support.
[12:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> Let's say you have a set of tabs that are in an RTL section.
[12:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> But inside those tabs, there is a section that is LTR.
[12:15:22] <arschmitz> right
[12:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> Using CSS rules that start with ".rtl" will make the widget think it's RTL even though it's really LTR inside RTL.
[12:15:28] <arschmitz> we even talked about specific words inline
[12:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> @Guest16271 Do you have examples of where the generic rules would come into play?
[12:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> The `isRtl()` implementation in #2 is also too restrictive.
[12:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> You have to walk the DOM.
[12:17:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also not sure that separate stylesheets are necessary.
[12:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> The only reason to keep them separate would be to make them optional.
[12:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> How much code are we really talking about and does it make sense to have optional CSS if the JS isn't optional?
[12:17:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i think that would depnd on how much weight it ends up adding
[12:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we aren't going to build RTL extensions for widgets, right?
[12:18:19] <arschmitz> if its like doubling all the css vs just  small bit but i cant imagine it would be that much
[12:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> The RTL logic will be built into the core of the widgets.
[12:18:25] <arschmitz> we had not talked about it
[12:18:38] <arschmitz> we talked about even baking as much as possible into the factory
[12:20:21] <Guest16271> regarding nested dir, I agree with you. but we should be able to find a workaround for that case
[12:20:49] <Guest16271> that is why we proposed adding new dir option to the widget module
[12:20:54] <arschmitz> the problem is with a approach that uses a class is its inherited
[12:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> Widgets shouldn't need to know that explicitly.
[12:21:08] <arschmitz> and you cant keep swithcing back and forth inherited for ever
[12:21:24] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's wrong for a widget to be the thing that dictates it. HTML already has a method for saying content is RTL.
[12:21:28] <arschmitz> the specificity becomes too much
[12:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> We solved the nesting problem with accordion icons though.
[12:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> So we do have a model for that.
[12:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember what it is off the top of my head though.
[12:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> Hmmâ€¦.looks like accordion CSS has be drastically reduced at some point.
[12:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Guest16271: Perhaps you can start with a PR that makes a single widget work.
[12:26:09] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can work from there with actual code to discuss.
[12:26:10] <Guest16271> if you prefer a specific approach/model to follow, I have no problem with that
[12:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> Progressbar is the simplest widget, so that might be a good starting point.
[12:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the main thing is: No RTL option, query the DOM.
[12:26:49] <Guest16271> ok I will
[12:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> We're always in #jqueryui-dev, so you can hang out in there and ask questions and get help with implementation.
[12:27:27] <Guest16271> should I even use this.widget().css( "direction" );  ?
[12:27:38] <arschmitz> something like .closest( "[dir]" )
[12:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't thought through all the scenarios, but I'm pretty sure you want to use `this.element`, not `this.widget()`.
[12:28:31] <arschmitz> Guest16271: sorry that was not a response to you
[12:28:37] <arschmitz> but a general statment
[12:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> And then use .closest( "[dir]" ) as arschmitz mentioned.
[12:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> Starting from this.widget() can put you in a completely random part of the DOM.
[12:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> But generated stacking elements will need to inherit their direction.
[12:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> So a menu for an RTL autocomplete will have to be RTL regardless of its position in the DOM.
[12:30:19] <arschmitz> right
[12:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> This applies to a lot of elements, but won't come up with the progressbar implementation.
[12:30:56] <Guest16271> I will take that into consideration
[12:31:11] <Guest16271> should I made any changes to ui/widget.js ?
[12:31:21] <arschmitz> probably not to start
[12:31:45] <arschmitz> but if there are common things we can extract and share between widgets thats where they would go
[12:32:31] <Guest16271> something like isRTL() ? :)
[12:32:59] <arschmitz> or maybe getDir()
[12:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the base widget should have a method for getting the direction.
[12:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> isRTL() is probably easier to work with than getDir()
[12:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> Unless dir can be bidi.
[12:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, just ltr, rtl, auto.
[12:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> So isRtl() is good.
[12:40:52] <Guest16271> That great. I going to submit PR soon for the accordion widget as a start point for our mirroring support
[12:41:55] <Guest16271> Thanks for your support
[12:50:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, looking forward to that.
[12:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[12:50:34] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
