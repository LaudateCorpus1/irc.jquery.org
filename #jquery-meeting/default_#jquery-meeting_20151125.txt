[12:02:20] <fnagel> hey
[12:02:33] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:53] <jzaefferer> I just got back, apparently scott_gonzalez isn't around at all
[12:04:37] <arschmitz> day before thanksgiving
[12:04:48] <arschmitz> many people dont work or only half day today
[12:05:02] <jzaefferer> gotcha
[12:05:10] <jzaefferer> so tomorrow you're all feasting on turkey?
[12:05:17] <arschmitz> yup
[12:05:41] <jzaefferer> I never made it to the US for thanksgiving :/
[12:06:00] <jzaefferer> Helloween once, 4th of July twice :-)
[12:06:03] <jzaefferer> aanyway
[12:06:12] <jzaefferer> fnagel: what's new on datepicker?
[12:06:20] <fnagel> Not much
[12:06:24] <fnagel> waiting for review
[12:06:55] <jzaefferer> this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1651
[12:07:15] <fnagel> yes
[12:07:20] <jzaefferer> Could you start working on focus issues in the meantime?
[12:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm back!
[12:07:31] <fnagel> Next on my list
[12:07:31] <jzaefferer> Might not have much overlap
[12:07:48] <fnagel> right
[12:08:37] <jzaefferer> Shouldn't justify further ignoring your PR, but given our constrained resources, might be better...
[12:09:26] <jzaefferer> As for the release script, I made some progress there yesterday, with help from Rafael
[12:09:32] <fnagel> need some more time for the focus issue, it's one of the bigger one with much related issues
[12:09:42] <jzaefferer> Still not quite done, but at least I have an idea how to make the rest work
[12:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> I still have no idea what's going on with stage.api.
[12:10:00] <scott_gonzalez> I keep trying to get in touch with Adam, but we keep missing each other.
[12:10:39] <jzaefferer> ok
[12:10:50] <jzaefferer> How are you doing on the upgrade guide?
[12:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> Other than effects, it's done.
[12:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> So good enough for a beta release.
[12:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on effects API docs today.
[12:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> Which need to be done before the upgrade guide for effects.
[12:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> I realized that core doesn't even document $.fx.step.
[12:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm working on that right now.
[12:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> Since we need to document $.fx.step.clip for UI.
[12:12:54] <jzaefferer> What are the odds of running into documented core APIs?
[12:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[12:14:10] <jzaefferer> Let me try that again
[12:14:19] <jzaefferer> What are the odds of running into undocumented core APIs???111
[12:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> ohhhh
[12:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'd guess it's like 1-2% of public APIs are undocumented.
[12:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> As small as core is, it does have a LOT of API surface.
[12:15:35] <jzaefferer> yeah
[12:15:39] <jzaefferer> like jQuery.speed? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/830
[12:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:16:25] <jzaefferer> or jQuery.easing? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/766
[12:16:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: will you have time to review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1651 ?
[12:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> Would you prefer if I review that before working on effects docs?/
[12:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> I can start with either.
[12:18:56] <jzaefferer> Then go for datepicker first, while fnagel is available to work on that
[12:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> I can do that right after the dev leads meeting.
[12:19:28] <fnagel> nice
[12:21:39] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: how's mobile doing on integrating UI widgets? Are there any blockers on the UI side?
[12:21:57] <jzaefferer> do you care about the 1.12 release getting out, or are you integrating from master anyway?
[12:22:00] <arschmitz> not that we have run into yet
[12:22:14] <arschmitz> we are working off master
[12:24:05] <jzaefferer> okay
[12:24:43] <jzaefferer> I hope to finish the release script in the next days, can work with scott_gonzalez then to do the beta release
[12:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[12:25:17] <jzaefferer> I won't be around for the dev leads meeting, but then I'm not project lead anymore, so whatever /o\
[12:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> Slacker
[12:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[12:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> We can be dual leads. We effectively are anyway.
[12:28:26] <arschmitz> that sounds electrical
[12:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> In that case, I'll be the negative lead and you can be the positive lead.
[12:29:36] <arschmitz> lol
[12:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> And then we can let people choose whether they want to use reality or common perception for how electricity works.
[12:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway... Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[12:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
