[14:01:22] <jasperdegroot> hi

[14:03:42] <arschmitz> looks like its just us again
[14:03:44] <arschmitz> oh hey
[14:03:53] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... just made it.
[14:04:06] <arschmitz> no problem
[14:04:11] <gabrielschulhof> My house is still not ready for us to move in, so we're all over the place.
[14:04:24] <arschmitz> where did you end up exactly?
[14:04:40] <gabrielschulhof> Hotel in Espoo -> Greece -> Hotel in Espoo -> Hotel in Espoo
[14:04:54] <arschmitz> oh i thought this was the move to canada
[14:04:59] <gabrielschulhof> Working wherever and whenever I can all the while.
[14:05:03] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, no.
[14:05:10] <jasperdegroot> sounds like fun ;)
[14:05:10] <gabrielschulhof> That got cancelled :/
[14:05:17] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: It's a ball.
[14:05:18] <arschmitz> oh too bad
[14:05:38] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, well, you take what you can get.
[14:05:44] <arschmitz> yup
[14:05:45] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:06:04] <arschmitz> so there is only one real update i have this week besides trying to find time to finish changelog which is really really long lol
[14:06:05] <gabrielschulhof> Anyhoo, so that's my excuse for not having done anything *cringe*
[14:06:17] <arschmitz> which is the website deploys got fixed
[14:06:36] <apsdehal> Hi from New Jersey
[14:06:38] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: you may have also missed i got download building working with 1.5 a couple weeks ago
[14:06:48] <arschmitz> apsdehal: HEY! how was your trip?
[14:07:00] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Say what?! UI's DB?
[14:07:04] <arschmitz> no ours
[14:07:11] <apsdehal> It was good, just setting up stuff in my apartment
[14:07:15] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK. Cool!
[14:07:22] <jasperdegroot> hey apsdehal
[14:07:27] <arschmitz> so we will have DB for full 1.5 release schedule
[14:07:29] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: Awesome!
[14:08:00] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... does that mean we have finally unified the online download builder with our full-release builder scripts?
[14:08:11] <arschmitz> um possibly lol
[14:08:11] <apsdehal> I am now in same timezone as arschmitz :p
[14:08:24] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: You know how we had load-order issues in custom-build vs. CDN.
[14:08:28] <arschmitz> right
[14:08:40] <arschmitz> yeah so i didnt do much to fix DB
[14:08:58] <gabrielschulhof> So, if CDN build === Custom build with all checkboxes checked, then that would be golden.
[14:09:01] <arschmitz> since it was amd based already it just mostly needed to have some bad dependency declarations fixed
[14:09:24] <arschmitz> the biggest thing that changed is the built non minified file
[14:09:36] <arschmitz> we used to strip the comments and wrapper out of
[14:09:41] <arschmitz> it no longer does that
[14:10:03] <arschmitz> but the minified one is still stripped properly
[14:10:10] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, I see. Good.
[14:10:28] <arschmitz> because we took out all the boundry comments
[14:10:50] <arschmitz> but i dont really care about the non minified one that should only be for development anyway
[14:11:10] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, exactly.
[14:11:27] <gabrielschulhof> So, how did you strip the minified without the comments? Did you actually parse it with esprima and all that?
[14:11:52] <arschmitz> no its already part of builder to do that
[14:11:58] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, sweet!
[14:12:00] <arschmitz> you can try it
[14:12:07] <arschmitz> its working with master on the live site
[14:12:25] <gabrielschulhof> Super-cool!
[14:12:50] <arschmitz> yeah very happy to have DB working with 1.5
[14:12:56] <apsdehal> Awesome
[14:13:39] <arschmitz> aside from that iv been pretty busy with adjusting to job change
[14:13:54] <arschmitz> just trying to get the changelog finished so we can release alpha
[14:13:55] <gabrielschulhof> Job change, you say?
[14:14:01] <arschmitz> yes
[14:14:14] <jasperdegroot> oh, new job again?
[14:14:15] <gabrielschulhof> Wow! My house gets torn down, and it unleashes a whirlwind :)
[14:14:35] <arschmitz> yeah company i went to last year ran out of money
[14:14:51] <gabrielschulhof> *cringe* sounds harsh ...
[14:14:59] <jasperdegroot> aii
[14:15:02] <arschmitz> yeah such is life on to bigger and better things
[14:16:04] <arschmitz> still have 25% OSS so will still have time for jquery stuff
[14:16:24] <jasperdegroot> nice
[14:16:32] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Congrats!
[14:16:51] <arschmitz> thank you
[14:18:51] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Congrats! So CUR's future is in jeopardy?
[14:18:55] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: did you have anything this week
[14:19:06] <jasperdegroot> yeah one thing
[14:19:09] <arschmitz> apsdehal: they laid all employees off a few weeks ago so yes lol
[14:19:20] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8500
[14:19:28] <jasperdegroot> autoprefixer
[14:19:32] <arschmitz> right i meant to review this last week sorry
[14:19:51] <jasperdegroot> first thing is that I don't have any idea why the tests fail
[14:20:02] <arschmitz> ok i can look at that
[14:20:41] <jasperdegroot> second thing is that I later realised that with autoprefixer the vendor prefixes are only added in a build
[14:20:51] <jasperdegroot> not when you develop local
[14:21:14] <jasperdegroot> with current CSS no problem if you use latest versions of Chrome or FF
[14:21:34] <arschmitz> right
[14:21:48] <arschmitz> so the tests do a build
[14:22:02] <jasperdegroot> but might become a problem if we add CSS that uses a new experimental feature
[14:22:04] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:22:05] <arschmitz> but we would have to remember to always check demos through the dist directory
[14:22:19] <jasperdegroot> tests don't fail if I run locally in the browser
[14:22:33] <arschmitz> did you try local in phantom
[14:22:41] <arschmitz> phantom has a pretty old rendering engine
[14:22:42] <jasperdegroot> yeah, there they fail
[14:22:44] <arschmitz> ok
[14:22:57] <arschmitz> so its probably something that phantom does not support or something ill loook at it
[14:22:57] <jasperdegroot> but the strange thing is
[14:23:11] <jasperdegroot> that the test that fail indicate a JS problem
[14:23:31] <jasperdegroot> but the JS file in my branch is exactly the same as the one in master
[14:23:41] <jasperdegroot> the one in the dist folder I mean
[14:23:52] <gabrielschulhof> Phantom doesn't produce very reliable traces.
[14:24:18] <gabrielschulhof> Much better in Chrome. Of course things fail far more rarely in Chrome :/
[14:24:25] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:24:54] <gabrielschulhof> Also, I don't see how you could debug phantom, except with a ton of console.log()s
[14:25:48] <arschmitz> thats my phantom go to lol
[14:26:01] <arschmitz> quick and dirty but always works for me
[14:28:24] <jasperdegroot> that's all I had
[14:29:16] <arschmitz> apsdehal: i know you have been traveling but did you have anything
[14:33:32] <arschmitz> ok well i guess thats it for today
[14:33:36] <arschmitz> see everyone next week
[14:34:18] <jasperdegroot> later all
[14:36:55] <gabrielschulhof> L8R
