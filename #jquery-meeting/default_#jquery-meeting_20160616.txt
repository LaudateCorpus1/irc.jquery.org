[12:01:00] <bethge_> Hi :D
[12:01:25] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with arschmitz' gesture recognition request.
[12:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> There was no PEWG meeting this week because many of the members are at a conference.
[12:06:08] <arschmitz> So on hammer.js we started working on our v3 re-write and something we want to support is complex gestures along with scrolling. example being you have a scrollable zoomable div. The user places 2 active pointers on the target you want to handle the events
[12:06:22] <arschmitz> if there is only one active pointer let the user agent handle it like normal
[12:06:39] <arschmitz> so my proposal is to add touch-action:single-point;
[12:06:41] <arschmitz> or similar
[12:07:04] <arschmitz> so The user agent may consider touches only when there is a single active pointer on the target element
[12:07:28] <arschmitz> if there is a delay between the 2 pointers becoming active and scrolling has already begun continue to allow the user agent to handle
[12:07:40] <arschmitz> if scrolling has not begun pass off to JS
[12:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> So I talked with arschmitz about this briefly this morning. I don't think you can handle this right now, so a new touch-action as proposed would probably be necessary.
[12:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> bethge_: Do you have any ideas on how this could be implemented today?
[12:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> And if not, what are your thoughts on the proposal?
[12:13:21] <bethge_> Would that be something PEP would implement? It sounds really nice, but I thought PEP is supposed to just be a polyfill for pointer events.
[12:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz will post the proposal to the public-pointer-events mailing list .
[12:13:34] <bethge_> Ah, ok, now i see
[12:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> We'd only implement if it was added to the spec.
[12:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> But I figured it'd be good to gather feedback here before arschmitz posts on the mailing list.
[12:14:12] <arschmitz> yup it would be appreciated
[12:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously the hammer team is behind the proposal. But if we're behind it as well, that'd be good information to include in the proposal.
[12:15:34] <bethge_> Yeah, I am trying to think of all the possibilities
[12:17:17] <bethge_> Sounds like a really nice extension to me.
[12:18:51] <arschmitz> yeah to me it seems like a common use case
[12:18:59] <arschmitz> that you want to handle multi touch but not single
[12:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> I know we've talked about the use of multi-point gestures in PEWG calls.
[12:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> But we never go into details because we can't discuss or spec gestures due to patent issues.
[12:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> But it has come up in the context of consistent pointer IDs across frames.
[12:22:44] <scott_gonzalez> And how that's important to detect multi-point gestures that might cross frames.
[12:25:08] <bethge_> Currently there is this note in the spec: https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#h-note25
[12:25:20] <bethge_> Not to say, that this cannot change :)
[12:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[12:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> If we can show that this will prevent hammer from switching to pointer events, that might cause it to change.
[12:27:33] <arschmitz> I:-)
[12:27:40] <bethge_> hehe, "no pressure, buuuut ..." :-D
[12:28:31] <arschmitz> Thankfully both Rick and Jacob have help with hammer a lot too and I rather invested in seeing us move forward with pointer events and offered to help represent anything we need
[12:29:11] <arschmitz> So hopefully they'll be fairly receptive
[12:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they definitely don't want to have situations where pointer events can't do something that touch events, mouse events, or native can do.
[12:35:03] <bethge_> That really sounds good. Would you say Chrome is also fully pursuing pointer events and wants to sooner or later deprecate mouse and touch?
[12:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yes to fully pursuing, but there's no indication that any browser will drop mouse or touch.
[12:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> I like to think of that as a theoretical future, but I don't know if there will ever be any browser implemented without mouse and touch.
[12:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else to discuss today?
[12:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all.
[12:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[14:02:25] <arschmitz> apsdehal: agcolom: sfrisk: cogwurx: gabriels1hulhof: meeting time
[14:02:29] <sfrisk> hello!
[14:02:32] <agcolom> hello!
[14:02:36] <cogwurx> Greetings!
[14:02:45] <apsdehal> Hi
[14:02:55] <apsdehal> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit
[14:04:18] <cogwurx> I have no updates...been slammed with side work so no progress on demo
[14:04:35] <cogwurx> the spirit is willing but the time is not :-[
[14:05:44] <arschmitz> cogwurx: no problem
[14:06:09] <arschmitz> the big thing as usual last few weeks is selectmenu
[14:06:19] <arschmitz> but it looks like gabriels1hulhof is missing
[14:06:41] <arschmitz> he had a PR on ui to fix a controlgroup bug he found which i reviewed
[14:06:58] <arschmitz> seems like withe a couple minor remaining things scott_gonzalez mentioned it should be good to go
[14:07:37] <arschmitz> looks like we might we waiting quite a while before selectmenu is ready at this point also
[14:07:47] <arschmitz> since gabriels1hulhof is on vacation for the next month
[14:08:15] <cogwurx> month vacation!! lucky
[14:08:52] <arschmitz> right!
[14:09:00] <arschmitz> i have not had a vacation in 2 years lol
[14:09:07] <arschmitz> id kill for a month long one
[14:09:38] <cogwurx> same here
[14:09:55] <sfrisk> my next vacation is "Paint new apartment and move"
[14:10:00] <arschmitz> i didnt get a chance to push the changes for core git but will do it this week had a lot come up this week that kept me distracted
[14:11:30] <arschmitz> apsdehal: has continued to do a lot of work in the tracker
[14:11:45] <arschmitz> apsdehal: any questions or progress to report/
[14:11:52] <apsdehal__> Yes
[14:12:05] <apsdehal__> Last week also some issues were left due to lack of time
[14:12:25] <apsdehal__> I confirmed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8140
[14:12:43] <apsdehal__> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8289
[14:12:57] <apsdehal__> if anyone wants to have a look at them
[14:13:51] <arschmitz> 8140
[14:14:01] <arschmitz> gabriels1hulhof: has looked at before
[14:14:06] <arschmitz> and had a plan to fix it
[14:14:13] <arschmitz> but i dont recall exactly what his plan was
[14:14:39] <arschmitz> the iOS one i started to look at but have not found whats causing it yet
[14:14:44] <arschmitz> its pretty weird
[14:15:24] <apsdehal__> Yes, but it exists actually, You can tell me later, I can look into it.
[14:15:40] <arschmitz> yes i reproduced it easily
[14:15:47] <arschmitz> i just have not been able to figure out the cause
[14:16:16] <apsdehal__> Also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7682 arschmitz  Your last comment on this issue, were you able to figure it out?
[14:17:34] <arschmitz> apsdehal__: we need to test against currently supported platforms
[14:17:40] <arschmitz> and see if we can reproduce this issue
[14:17:49] <arschmitz> if we can we need to file the bug with core
[14:18:03] <arschmitz> if you have not found the ticket im guessing it was closed at some point already
[14:18:08] <apsdehal> Do we have a list of currently supported platforms? I am not able to find it.
[14:18:15] <apsdehal> I mean for 1.5-dev
[14:18:44] <apsdehal> Many issue like removing vendor prefixed css properties and other things are also linked to that list.
[14:18:49] <arschmitz> ie11+, firefox current-1, chrome current-1, safari current - 1
[14:18:59] <arschmitz> android 4.0+
[14:19:17] <apsdehal> ios > 7 ?
[14:19:22] <arschmitz> yes
[14:19:23] <apsdehal> What about opera mini ?
[14:19:28] <arschmitz> not supported
[14:19:40] <apsdehal> and opera?
[14:19:50] <arschmitz> current -1
[14:19:55] <arschmitz> since its basicly chrome now lol
[14:20:02] <apsdehal> lol
[14:20:21] <apsdehal> Had an issue for gabriels1hulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8413
[14:20:28] <arschmitz> and windows phone
[14:20:33] <arschmitz> 8.1+
[14:21:06] <apsdehal> Since he is working on selectmenu I thought he might look at it. Issue hinders basic functionality of selectmenu
[14:21:28] <arschmitz> i didnt think we officially supported that
[14:21:46] <apsdehal> Filtering 2?
[14:21:52] <arschmitz> filtering a customselect
[14:22:19] <apsdehal> Sure? But I don't think it would be difficult to do so in simple cases
[14:23:16] <arschmitz> it would require changes to the widget to specificly support filterable
[14:23:29] <arschmitz> which we should not make instead we should remove the demo
[14:23:41] <arschmitz> since we plan on adopting the UI selectmenu ASAP
[14:24:23] <apsdehal> Ok I will open up a ticket for removing the demo, so what about the issue?
[14:24:27] <apsdehal> Should I close it?
[14:24:46] <arschmitz> probably
[14:25:01] <apsdehal> Last issue is also for you: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7700
[14:25:16] <apsdehal> Were you ever able to discuss the implementations?
[14:26:12] <arschmitz> no he never responded
[14:26:26] <arschmitz> feel free to ping if not id still like to keep open
[14:26:30] <arschmitz> i like the idea in general
[14:27:04] <apsdehal> Ok, I will ping frequent
[14:27:44] <apsdehal> That is all I have. Most of the issues that we are left with now are iOS specific and others have 1.6 as milestone
[14:27:58] <apsdehal> We should we down to 100 sometime soon
[14:28:13] <apsdehal> s/we/be
[14:33:49] <arschmitz> execlent
[14:33:59] <arschmitz> thats all i have with gabriels1hulhof and jasper missing
[14:34:10] <arschmitz> so unless someone else has something lets call it a day
