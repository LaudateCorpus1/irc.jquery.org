[10:00:30] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[10:00:37] <sfrisk> `chassis-team
[10:00:44] <sfrisk> bah, what is that command
[10:00:49] <arthurvr> `chassisteam
[10:00:49] <b-ot> arthurvr: agcolom, arschmitz, arthurvr, gnarf, helen, ianmaffett, jzaefferer, michaelarestad, rxaviers, sfrisk
[10:00:55] <arthurvr> sfrisk: ^
[10:00:56] <prasun> :)
[10:00:56] <sfrisk> ah, no dash
[10:01:07] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[10:01:26] <arschmitz> Hi
[10:01:28] <thejdeep> Hi :) first time, excited
[10:01:48] <sfrisk> Meeting notes can be found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:03:00] <michaelarestad> Hi
[10:03:19] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/42
[10:03:27] <michaelarestad> :D
[10:03:59] <arthurvr> Great!
[10:04:07] <sfrisk> Nice to see some new faces!
[10:04:20] <arthurvr> Sure! Welcome everyone!
[10:04:23] <arschmitz> thejdeep: prasun welcome
[10:04:36] <sfrisk> For those of you who don't know, the jQuery Foundation (and Chassis by extension) were accepted as mentors for GSOC this year
[10:04:41] <geekman-rohit> hi
[10:05:28] <arthurvr> Hey geekman-rohit!
[10:05:30] <prasun> i will work with CSS Framework .
[10:05:42] <sfrisk> Development for which will be starting late May this year, although early involvement is always appreciated
[10:06:40] <sfrisk> So the plan is to go over what happened last week, status of the PR, some issues that need addressing, the roadmap for the next few months, and then finally addressing some questions GSOC students might have.
[10:07:14] <sfrisk> So based on our discussions last meeting, I've posted the roadmap for Chassis: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/wiki/Chassis-Roadmap
[10:08:32] <sfrisk> I really would like to see version 1.0 more or less completed by early Summer, so that GSOC can work on tasks associated with that codebase
[10:08:49] <arthurvr> sfrisk: nice work.
[10:08:49] <michaelarestad> Cool.
[10:08:56] <sfrisk> version 1.0 will be a css framework, or the bare bones
[10:09:42] <sfrisk> So it should include a basic color pallet, typgoraphy, html4 elements, html5 elements (?), form validation, form input state styling, and hopefully a grid system of some sort
[10:10:09] <sfrisk> I know michaelarestad already posted on codepen.io a suggestion for typgoraphy, which will be made into a PR once we get the Initial Sass file structure PR landed
[10:10:44] <sfrisk> arschmitz I believe just made a few edits to that PR to finish up the last few requests, which were mostly copy changes for the readme file
[10:10:54] <arschmitz> Yes
[10:10:58] <arschmitz> i opened a new pr
[10:11:06] <arschmitz> because i cant push to michaelarestad fork
[10:11:40] <michaelarestad> Yep. I think I'll have time to actually start in on the typography PR this weekend once the folder structure lands.
[10:11:45] <sfrisk> :-D
[10:11:48] <arschmitz> if everyone is happy i can do the rest of the work to land that ( needs a rebase and some names fixed etc )
[10:12:01] <michaelarestad> WFM
[10:12:12] <sfrisk> Sounds good to me, if anyone else wants to look over it, you can find the PR here: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/42
[10:12:34] <arschmitz> If possible i would like to land alone with https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/34 because there are MAJOR conflicts there
[10:12:44] <arschmitz> alone/along
[10:12:58] <michaelarestad> As for colors, I'd like to see where we land on the logo first. We can also do some fun things with Sass and color schemes if we wanted to.
[10:13:01] <sfrisk> (To give GSOC students an idea of how our PR system works, and also commit naming conventions)
[10:13:27] <sfrisk> yeah, well I figured colors was more of some variables that could easily get changed for font color, background color, etc
[10:13:31] <sfrisk> and button colors
[10:13:35] <sfrisk> and validation colors
[10:13:39] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:13:48] <michaelarestad> Could be as simple as switching out a sass map.
[10:14:14] <sfrisk> yeah, maybe come up with what we want to name the colors (success, error, base, background, etc)
[10:14:15] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: well we have planned a combo of http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/ which does a lot of color themeing and http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ which has a nice gallary of pre built
[10:14:31] <arschmitz> which would be implemented using sass varibles
[10:14:39] <sfrisk> and put placeholders in there, and get issacdurazo to help us out with a default color scheme
[10:14:41] <arschmitz> so i think that pretty much does that
[10:14:43] <michaelarestad> Nice.
[10:14:54] <arschmitz> as far as mapping colors
[10:15:07] <sfrisk> Also it seemed mostly people liked issacdurazo's blue logo?
[10:15:18] <geekman-rohit> the blue one, yep
[10:15:20] <arschmitz> but for our like base theme i would say maybe incorperate the logo colors
[10:15:24] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/27#issuecomment-73313133
[10:15:39] <sfrisk> I agree arschmitz
[10:15:40] <michaelarestad> I'm starting to lean toward the green.
[10:15:41] <arschmitz> blue got the most votes
[10:16:09] <thejdeep> +1 for blue
[10:16:56] <sfrisk> Well we can do one more vote here, if you want - and I'll put down the vote in the issue
[10:17:12] <sfrisk> so we can give isaacdurazo an actual answer
[10:18:09] <michaelarestad> After a quick skim, it looks like blue wins.
[10:18:18] <michaelarestad> Both here and on the thread.
[10:18:21] <arthurvr> Yup :)
[10:18:26] <sfrisk> okay, I'll make the comment in the issue then
[10:18:33] <michaelarestad> Cool.
[10:18:50] <isaacdurazo> \o/
[10:19:38] <sfrisk> For anyone who hasn't joined yet, there is a google group for Chassis (which will mostly be about non issue related things)
[10:19:40] <michaelarestad> Next issue: When do we get stickers with that logo?
[10:19:40] <sfrisk> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/css-chassis
[10:19:45] <sfrisk> STICKERS
[10:19:47] <sfrisk> ALL THE STICKERS
[10:19:48] <sfrisk> lol
[10:20:02] <sfrisk> I think issacdurazo's next goal was some variations of how to use that color?
[10:20:07] <sfrisk> and logo
[10:20:33] <isaacdurazo> that is correct sfrisk
[10:20:40] <isaacdurazo> I'll start working on that
[10:20:46] <sfrisk> Awesome, thanks. :-)
[10:21:01] <michaelarestad> I think, depending on how the logo was built, we can do some really crazy animation stuff with it. If you post a final-ish version, isaacdurazo, I can mess with it a bit in some CodePens.
[10:21:20] <sfrisk> Also for anyone joining the google group, please indicate your IRC and github name?
[10:21:49] <arthurvr> yeah, seems like a good idea.
[10:21:52] <sfrisk> that would be awesome michaelarestad
[10:21:55] <isaacdurazo> michaelarestad awesome! I'll post an svg later today
[10:22:10] <michaelarestad> Perfect.
[10:22:22] <geekman-rohit> I mentioned the github name should that do?
[10:22:35] <sfrisk> I could think of some cool things you could do with SVGs or even clipping masks
[10:22:45] <sfrisk> yup, that should work
[10:22:45] <arschmitz> might want to do github and IRC if they are different
[10:22:56] <sfrisk> what arschmitz said actually
[10:23:09] <geekman-rohit> coincidentally, same
[10:23:20] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: most are but not all
[10:23:23] <sfrisk> I found it was easier to match up my irc name with my github
[10:24:13] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz : agreed
[10:24:26] <sfrisk> so we discussed arschmitz updating the sass file structure and landing that
[10:24:42] <sfrisk> I'll probably take on form elements
[10:25:00] <sfrisk> also, arschmitz, you mentioned doing some updates to performance testing?
[10:25:16] <arschmitz> yes the PR has been updated quite a bit
[10:25:33] <sfrisk> summary for the group?
[10:25:51] <arschmitz> added jquery ui 1.12 for comparison frameworks
[10:26:09] <arschmitz> and completely re did our grunt configuration
[10:26:24] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/34/files
[10:28:15] <sfrisk> awesome
[10:28:52] <sfrisk> For the GSOC people - arschmitz has been working on performance testing other frameworks in order to prepare for performance testing Chassis in the future
[10:29:00] <sfrisk> and figure out how we're doing compared to other browsers
[10:29:06] <sfrisk> err css frameworks*
[10:29:07] <sfrisk> not browsers
[10:30:03] <thejdeep> arschmitz, awesome stuff, can I help out in adding more frameworks to the suite?
[10:30:22] <prasun> i don't get it "performance-testing"
[10:30:31] <arschmitz> thejdeep: absolutly
[10:30:59] <arschmitz> we need to add both more frameworks and other componenets from existing one
[10:31:00] <sfrisk> prasun, basically we're seeing how quickly various components can render on the page, as well as how quickly the CSS files load in browser
[10:31:17] <thejdeep> ref : http://104.236.81.132:5984//css-perf/_design/site/index.html#/page-select
[10:31:20] <sfrisk> there are many ways to code things with CSS, but some are more efficent than others
[10:31:33] <prasun> got it
[10:31:42] <sfrisk> efficient*
[10:31:45] <sfrisk> and have a higher frame rate
[10:31:48] <arschmitz> it also invloves things like maintaing framerates while scrolling
[10:32:00] <arschmitz> how many nodes per layout
[10:32:04] <arschmitz> expensive repaints
[10:33:26] <sfrisk> This kind of stuff is really important, especially with a css project that needs to be mobile friendly.
[10:34:20] <arschmitz> thejdeep: if this is something you want to help more with we can really use it right now this is a blocker for other development
[10:34:35] <arschmitz> thejdeep: i can discuss more details about this outside the meeting though to not hold things up
[10:34:35] <thejdeep> arschmitz, I see stats for various components from frameworks, maybe we should build a comparison graph ?
[10:34:46] <thejdeep> arschmitz, cool
[10:35:01] <arschmitz> thejdeep: https://github.com/axemclion/perfjankie/issues/19
[10:35:05] <michaelarestad> > especially with a css project that needs to be mobile friendly.
[10:35:22] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, I would love to help here too
[10:35:31] <michaelarestad> Even ones that are desktop need to be careful with expensive styles. (github diffs are good example)
[10:35:46] <sfrisk> true
[10:36:03] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: every try to load a diff view with 3000+ changes lines and 300+ diff comments? ;-p
[10:36:07] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:36:08] <sfrisk> I think I was thinking more on the file size side of things when I mentioned mobile friendly
[10:36:15] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: painfull
[10:36:18] <michaelarestad> Ever try to do that after adding box shadows?
[10:36:26] <arschmitz> ha ha ha ha
[10:36:32] <arschmitz> not sure i want to
[10:36:32] <sfrisk> fuuuuuun
[10:36:59] <arschmitz> it can allready be ~60 load on a lot of diffs
[10:37:04] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:37:07] <sfrisk> so discussion for anyone interested in performance testing after the meeting in css-chassis?
[10:37:20] <arschmitz> sfrisk: im in another meeting then
[10:37:36] <sfrisk> okay, then discuss it in the issue?
[10:37:50] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/19
[10:37:54] <arschmitz> Im going to make an issue to add more
[10:37:59] <sfrisk> ok
[10:38:03] <arschmitz> to the current one and close that one with the current pr if thats ok
[10:38:17] <sfrisk> works for me
[10:38:38] <arschmitz> cool
[10:38:45] <sfrisk> did we agree on putting perfomance testing in the repo, or keep it seperate, I can't remember
[10:39:02] <arschmitz> you said you wanted it in repo
[10:39:32] <arschmitz> on master similar to how sizzle does it
[10:39:43] <sfrisk> okay, that sounds right
[10:39:46] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/tree/master/speed
[10:40:30] <arschmitz> sfrisk: still good with that?
[10:41:29] <sfrisk> no, it makes sense, I was just re-reading the PR
[10:41:36] <arschmitz> ok
[10:42:01] <sfrisk> And could see the idea of this being a separate repo to encourage other frameworks to contribute might be a good thing
[10:42:16] <sfrisk> but for now, keep it within project, we can always break it out if we need to
[10:42:23] <arschmitz> yes both have advantages
[10:42:38] <arschmitz> but main disadvantage to being external is its much harder to integrate with CI
[10:42:44] <sfrisk> yup
[10:42:53] <sfrisk> well for now, keep it internal
[10:43:00] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:43:16] <sfrisk> I reserve the right to change my mind later as the project evolves
[10:43:18] <sfrisk> :-)
[10:43:34] <michaelarestad> Integration with CI is pretty important.
[10:43:40] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:43:52] <sfrisk> okay, land away
[10:44:26] <sfrisk> and create issues for the frameworks you want to add, plus other performance tesitng stuff
[10:44:40] <sfrisk> and if other people are interested in helping out, they'll have an idea of where to start
[10:45:00] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:45:01] <arschmitz> yup
[10:45:03] <geekman-rohit> exactly a concern I was gonna raise
[10:45:47] <michaelarestad> We probably could add a few more labels and start labeling issues for sorting as the project grows.
[10:46:06] <sfrisk> agreed
[10:46:35] <sfrisk> okay, so back on the version 1.0 stuff, I'm going to add an issue to also define the variable names for the color pallet as well, that could be easily edible in the theme roller.
[10:46:57] <sfrisk> nothing crazy, just like base font, background, and some validation colors
[10:47:12] <sfrisk> to give us a starting point for typography and form validation
[10:47:15] <sfrisk> etc
[10:47:24] <michaelarestad> That's going to be a fun issue. :)
[10:47:28] <geekman-rohit> the output for theme roller will be just the variables, right?
[10:48:14] <sfrisk> it will be centered around scss variables, but it will cover I think a bit more than color
[10:48:19] <sfrisk> you can change typography and stuff like that
[10:48:40] <sfrisk> A good example of what we're looking at is http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/
[10:48:44] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: no
[10:48:56] <arschmitz> it will be a fully built ready to use theme
[10:49:12] <arschmitz> the idea is you dont have to use sass and compile it yourself
[10:49:19] <geekman-rohit> but what will change?
[10:49:21] <sfrisk> not http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables
[10:49:27] <geekman-rohit> variables or other scss as well
[10:49:35] <arschmitz> just varibles
[10:49:50] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: try using http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/
[10:49:51] <geekman-rohit> yep, get it now!
[10:49:53] <arschmitz> and download a theme
[10:50:11] <arschmitz> it does the same thing just using a token replacer instead of sass
[10:50:15] <geekman-rohit> yes, on it already
[10:50:27] <geekman-rohit> Im used to less, learning sass now
[10:50:52] <michaelarestad> Sass is similar with a bit more complex structure.
[10:50:56] <michaelarestad> *or can be
[10:51:00] <sfrisk> I <3 Sass
[10:51:04] <thejdeep> sfrisk, are we looking at a theme roller for v1.0 ?
[10:51:09] <sfrisk> yes
[10:51:19] <geekman-rohit> I liked how less structured my css, I hope I love sass too
[10:51:34] <michaelarestad> You will.
[10:52:31] <sfrisk>  a theme roller is needed for v1.0, thejdeep.
[10:53:14] <michaelarestad> Gotta run. Will catch up later.
[10:53:16] <thejdeep> sfrisk, ok
[10:53:17] <sfrisk> so I've gone through everything on my list that needed to be covered, and the todo list
[10:53:24] <geekman-rohit> And jquery and jquerymobile will adapt that too? or wil this one completely replace those?
[10:53:29] <sfrisk> do any GSOC people (or anyone else in general) have any questions
[10:53:44] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: the themeroller will be for ui/mobile/and chassis
[10:53:50] <sfrisk> jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile will be adopting Chassis for the CSS side of things
[10:53:56] <geekman-rohit> cool
[10:54:38] <fossdevil> Hi all, Sorry for joining in late. I will be applying to GSoC.I wish to work on css-chassis. Can you let me know where to begin? I am proficient in CSS, JavaScript
[10:55:14] <arschmitz> fossdevil: can you ask in #css-chassis we are just wrapping up here
[10:55:25] <fossdevil> sure
[10:55:27] <sfrisk> fossdevil, check out the issues listed on css-chassis.com, and I'll be posting up the meeting notes either later tonight or early tomorrow
[10:55:45] <sfrisk> and if you have any other questions, we can chat about it in #css-chassis
[10:56:07] <fossdevil> Doing that. I am also going through the meeting logs right now.
[10:56:14] <fossdevil> Sure
[10:57:07] <sfrisk> and just a heads up, I'll be at a convention this weekend so I won't be on IRC much Thursday - Sunday
[10:57:42] <arschmitz> i should be around
[10:57:58] <fossdevil> sfrisk : Where will you be posting the meeting notes?
[10:58:09] <sfrisk> meetings.jquery.org/category/chassis/
[10:58:33] <arschmitz> however for anyone looking for me it says im online 24hours a day this does not mean im actually at the computer plesase be patient i promise i will get back to you
[10:58:34] <sfrisk> although you can also find my rough meeting notes here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:59:34] <sfrisk> okay on that note, this meeting is done. See you all in #css-chassis
