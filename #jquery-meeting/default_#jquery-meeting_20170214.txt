[14:05:37] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:05:50] <sfrisk> kristyjy, geekman-rohit, nashvail
[14:06:11] <sumedhN> Hello everyone
[14:06:24] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:06:39] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk this channel is not logged anymore it seems
[14:06:51] <sfrisk> weird
[14:06:57] <geekman-rohit> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/
[14:07:16] <geekman-rohit> stopped on December 23rd the day I turned 23
[14:07:28] <sumedhN> yes from last few weeks I wasn't able to access logs
[14:07:53] <sfrisk> I can ask around
[14:08:44] <sfrisk> Okay, first up, kristyjy did rebase master into her tables branch
[14:08:48] <sfrisk> If people want to review it
[14:09:06] <sfrisk> Same needs to happen with inputs
[14:09:49] <sfrisk> I've brought this up a few times in meetings, but I think we're due to kinda analyze this project and what we want from it, and where we want it to go
[14:10:22] <sfrisk> We've been working on this for at least two years now, not the most progress, and I think part of that is due to lack of cohesive vision of what we want, and how things are styled
[14:10:52] <kristyjy> sorry I'm late. Got pulled away right at the wrong time lol
[14:11:10] <sfrisk> it happens
[14:11:33] <sfrisk> I'm thinking we need to start up an issue thread that is almost a "Where do we want to go from here"
[14:12:00] <sfrisk> this project is supposed to be a standalone CSS project that could be integrated in with jquery mobile or jQuery UI
[14:12:10] <sfrisk> it might be worth looking at if we should change directions anywhere
[14:12:27] <kristyjy> That sounds like a good plan to me.
[14:12:28] <sfrisk> A lot of javascript frameworks, for example, have been switching to using CSS modules
[14:12:32] <geekman-rohit> sounds like a good idea
[14:12:59] <sfrisk> I think it might be worth having a discussion at length of "Look, this scene has changed since we started, let's review what we're doing here"
[14:13:01] <geekman-rohit> we should also cut short on review times on focus on a quicker merges
[14:13:04] <kristyjy> Maybe we should map out a full plan of everything we want in V1 and then hand out tasks
[14:13:22] <sfrisk> Having designs would help with that
[14:13:36] <kristyjy> go a bit more waterfall.. I mean I'm not huge on the waterfall concept but after doing it this way I like the idea of a solid plan
[14:13:44] <sfrisk> I know nashvail was working on that at some point - we could come up what we want for a roadmap for V1 and come up with designs everyone works off
[14:13:52] <geekman-rohit> if we just hand out tasks without everyone being totally clear about things, wed end up with weird stuff
[14:13:53] <kristyjy> YES
[14:14:14] <kristyjy> definitely
[14:14:21] <geekman-rohit> yep
[14:14:25] <sfrisk> Because I think this could be an awesome project, and I'll admit, as lead I've been a bit lazy about my direction lately
[14:14:33] <sfrisk> but I think we should solidify on that as a team
[14:14:48] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk we all have day jobs and bills to pay
[14:14:53] <sfrisk> All the bills
[14:14:57] <sfrisk> :-)
[14:15:04] <sumedhN> As a contributor, I feel that the rate of merges should be increased
[14:15:15] <geekman-rohit> I agree with sumedhN
[14:15:23] <kristyjy> definitely I've been bad about contributing as well. I think with a plan I'll be better about it though
[14:15:45] <geekman-rohit> once we have the designs though we can be quicker to review as well, since we will have something to compare against
[14:15:50] <sfrisk> I think they should increase - but we need a definitely plan of how we want to do things
[14:16:09] <geekman-rohit> plan first.. yep!
[14:16:20] <sfrisk> having just a bunch of commits without issues attached to them, or don't match style guides or how did things elsewhere doesn't work
[14:17:01] <geekman-rohit> we should create a short guide also about our approaches to things.. px vs rems vs ems, mobile first vs desktop first. all that is distributed in various issues, we should get it all together in one guide
[14:17:52] <sfrisk> We could create .md files for guides
[14:17:55] <geekman-rohit> yep
[14:17:56] <sfrisk> refer to them in Getting Started
[14:18:09] <geekman-rohit> if we all set them up once ,I can maintain them later, update them as we discuss things
[14:18:51] <geekman-rohit> we could also fix a meeting solely for this purpose and make sure everyone is present
[14:19:15] <sfrisk> definitely
[14:19:23] <sfrisk> We could go with that's the purpose of next meeting
[14:19:29] <sfrisk> Reach out to Nashvail and arschmitz
[14:19:35] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:19:38] <kristyjy> awesome
[14:19:55] <sumedhN> Cool
[14:20:07] <geekman-rohit> when arthurvr was around things would get reviewed and cleaned so quick
[14:20:26] <kristyjy> that was so awesome
[14:23:03] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk theres a tiny PR #171 that is ready to merge in I guess
[14:23:23] <sfrisk> is that the meeting time one?
[14:23:29] <geekman-rohit> IRC chat
[14:23:41] <geekman-rohit> IRC logs*
[14:23:55] <sumedhN> Yes I opened it
[14:24:05] <sumedhN> I signed the cla still it is showing error
[14:24:29] <sfrisk> the new CLA?
[14:24:32] <sfrisk> from jQuery Foundation
[14:24:44] <sfrisk> Also created an issue thread here: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/176
[14:24:52] <sumedhN> new CLA?
[14:25:29] <geekman-rohit> he has signed new CLA
[14:25:33] <sfrisk> looks like it's not liking on the jquery foundation CLA
[14:25:34] <sfrisk> http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/status/?owner=jquery&repo=css-chassis&sha=8cba94e50592703aeed670a3cc34c9647b10895e
[14:25:41] <geekman-rohit> its the old ones that still failing
[14:25:50] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:25:54] <sfrisk> let me see if I can remove that
[14:26:01] <sumedhN> Yup
[14:26:30] <sfrisk> or I'll ask arschmitz
[14:26:36] <sumedhN> I was pretty confused with CLA part.....CLA is valid for my other issues and pr
[14:26:38] <sfrisk> or someone else with the JS foundation
[14:26:48] <geekman-rohit> the bot is obsolete now
[14:26:54] <sfrisk> it's because the jQuery Foundation turned into the JS Foundation
[14:26:55] <sfrisk> as we merged with other projects
[14:28:03] <sfrisk> okay, made a todo to look into fixing the CLA
[14:34:08] <sumedhN> okay
[14:35:20] <sfrisk> Going to close our older PRs that don't really work as well
[14:38:10] <sfrisk> everyone, please give your opinions in the issue "Where do we go from here" so it's documented
[14:38:18] <sfrisk> since it looks like these logs aren't being logged currently
[14:42:25] <sfrisk> Also, just as an fyi
[14:42:35] <sfrisk> jQuery has decided not to do GSoC this year
[14:43:07] <sfrisk> I know this time of year we tend to get a lot more people showing up to meetings
[14:43:23] <sfrisk> and the overhead of mentoring just became a bit too much
[14:43:31] <sfrisk> Jobs got jobby
[14:45:05] <sfrisk> Okay, looks like people have gotten quiet - either it's late, or demands from jobs
[14:45:12] <sfrisk> see everyone next week, and please comment on issue
