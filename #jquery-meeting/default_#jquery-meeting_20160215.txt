[12:00:27] <timmywil> DaveMethvin|away, m_gol, markelog https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhcW9_TlSwD8JnO1_HNnSYJAriTK9WYZ8uQNDvtAAhA/edit#
[12:00:35] <markelog> hey-hey
[12:02:00] <timmywil> da meetingz
[12:02:43] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2890 so markelog, what are your thoughts on adding insight only when someone runs grunt custom?
[12:04:07] <m_gol> present
[12:04:27] <timmywil> it's an american holiday btw. I'm actually off today. Might not see dave or richard.
[12:04:49] <markelog> happy presidents day!
[12:04:56] <timmywil> thanks!
[12:05:27] <timmywil> for insight, I'd like to nail down the next step
[12:07:20] <markelog> eslint uses this thing
[12:07:24] <markelog> as i recall
[12:07:28] <timmywil> I'm thinking make it a dev dependency and use it to track grunt commands
[12:07:30] <markelog> so we might just copy their behaviour
[12:07:56] <markelog> yeah, we don't it in "production"
[12:07:58] <timmywil> specifically custom build commands
[12:08:05] <timmywil> "custom" and "build"
[12:08:09] <m_gol> I'm just worried it will break people's builds
[12:08:15] <timmywil> how so?
[12:08:25] <markelog> i wonder if eslint ask permission
[12:08:29] <m_gol> because it needs to ask for permissions the first time it runs
[12:08:32] <markelog> if they don't
[12:08:34] <timmywil> ah, permission, right
[12:08:39] <markelog> we should be cool without it
[12:08:47] <m_gol> people were angry at bower for exactly this
[12:08:56] <timmywil> right, but if it requires keyboard input, it might break automated builds?
[12:08:58] <m_gol> as it broke a lot of builds because of these questions
[12:09:09] <markelog> so we don't ask questions
[12:09:23] <m_gol> I don't think that's a good idea
[12:09:51] <timmywil> yea, I don't want to track without permission.
[12:09:51] <m_gol> people have the right to expect local commands are not pinging a remote server without asking IMO
[12:10:13] <timmywil> brb
[12:10:16] <markelog> we can put that in readme
[12:10:31] <markelog> you know, if it is good for nsa )
[12:10:45] <timmywil> back
[12:10:54] <markelog> but i see the concern
[12:11:00] <markelog> that is what 3.0 though
[12:11:04] <markelog> breaking changes
[12:11:40] <timmywil> I don't think I want to break automated custom builds.
[12:12:03] <timmywil> maybe it's best not to do this right now
[12:12:23] <markelog> why not?
[12:12:47] <timmywil> because I don't think it's worth breaking custom builds
[12:12:52] <markelog> if people put "*" in their deps they expect to breakage
[12:13:33] <m_gol> it's not that, it's that people will try that locally, upload to CI and it will break there
[12:13:50] <markelog> it is still major
[12:13:52] <m_gol> then they'll have to check how to get rid of this message as it's not so easy to provide keyboard input in CI
[12:14:12] <timmywil> it's just a hassle
[12:14:17] <m_gol> they'll have to google an environmental variable to set to make it go away
[12:14:18] <m_gol> etc.
[12:14:38] <markelog> i'm not sure who would build jquery in their ci though
[12:14:46] <markelog> why not build it before
[12:14:49] <markelog> then commit it
[12:15:02] <markelog> i think we need something like insight
[12:15:07] <m_gol> they may not want to commit build artifacts
[12:15:15] <markelog> like what if **no one** uses those builds
[12:15:27] <markelog> that is not artefacts
[12:15:42] <markelog> but we spend so much time for their support
[12:16:11] <m_gol> markelog: what info would you like to get out of it?
[12:16:27] <markelog> how much people uses those builds, if any
[12:16:34] <markelog> if they do, what do they exclude
[12:16:49] <timmywil> well, we don't know for sure how many people use it, but we assume it doesn't get used a lot. We do have a web builder on the roadmap. I think we'll get more useful stats from that if/when we do it.
[12:17:27] <markelog> well, if that comes to the web builder, it would be a different story i think
[12:17:49] <m_gol> if we wanted to know how many people use those builds (compared to all users) we'd have to track all, not just custom builders
[12:17:49] <markelog> but if users do use builds
[12:17:54] <markelog> we should test them!
[12:18:16] <timmywil> we can't test every possible combination
[12:18:21] <m_gol> yeah
[12:18:22] <timmywil> but maybe the most common
[12:18:31] <markelog> we can find a ball park figure from npm/bower/git-clone
[12:18:32] <m_gol> e.g. jQuery Lite ;)
[12:18:43] <markelog> so what should we test?
[12:18:44] <m_gol> or slim
[12:18:48] <m_gol> whatever it's called
[12:18:53] <markelog> we can found that from insight
[12:19:01] <markelog> otherwise it would be shot in the dark
[12:19:25] <markelog> i think we will break some crazy ci's
[12:19:27] <markelog> we can back down
[12:19:31] <timmywil> until we have a web builder. in which case, I think we'd get a lot more info.
[12:19:47] <markelog> if we get one
[12:19:48] <m_gol> and easier as we can just set up analytics
[12:19:57] <markelog> that might long in the future
[12:20:03] <markelog> or will never happen
[12:20:08] <m_gol> I'd guess very few people do custom builds
[12:20:16] <m_gol> but if it gets to the web, there will be a lot of them
[12:20:19] <markelog> how do you know?
[12:20:35] <markelog> you don't m_gol
[12:20:35] <m_gol> I don't know, I think :-)
[12:20:38] <timmywil> we don't, but we don't get a lot of issues about it
[12:20:41] <markelog> that's just a speculation
[12:21:06] <m_gol> people prefer to click to installing Node, running Grunt, figuring out the syntax to the custom build command etc.
[12:21:23] <markelog> again, how do you know that?
[12:21:27] <m_gol> IMO any conclusion we'd get from the command line builder stats won't be applicable to the web one
[12:21:58] <markelog> not sure how you to come up to this conclusion
[12:22:06] <m_gol> I explained above how
[12:22:12] <markelog> okay, so my position to do it with perms, if there would be any issues, we can always back down
[12:22:57] <timmywil> If we did include it, I'd be inclined to do another beta before final. I'd rather do final next.
[12:23:23] <markelog> i don't understand from what that fear comes from
[12:23:29] <markelog> but that is your call
[12:23:33] <markelog> close it if you must
[12:23:49] <timmywil> it is the fear of the unknown. there is potential for problems, which calls for a trial period before releasing the final.
[12:23:57] <markelog> 3.0.1
[12:24:04] <markelog> and we all good
[12:24:14] <timmywil> I suppose that's true
[12:24:15] <markelog> we probably would need to release it anyway
[12:24:36] <markelog> just imagine how many efforts we spend on those builds
[12:24:40] <m_gol> I can see some value in this data
[12:24:51] <markelog> what if they all necessary
[12:24:51] <timmywil> ok ok
[12:24:53] <m_gol> although the web-based builder will IMO get different stats
[12:25:00] <timmywil> let's try it then.
[12:25:06] <timmywil> we can remove in 3.0.1 if it causes problems.
[12:25:11] <m_gol> ok
[12:25:17] <m_gol> but with permissions, please :)
[12:25:22] <timmywil> agreed
[12:25:27] <markelog> really? wow, did a just convince you guys?
[12:25:33] <markelog> *did i
[12:25:49] <m_gol> haha
[12:26:00] <markelog> didn't expect that at all!
[12:26:01] <markelog> ))
[12:26:26] <timmywil> power of reasoned debate :)
[12:27:23] <timmywil> ok, the rest I have has to do with landing some PRs. We're waiting on Dave to perf the fixHooks PR, and I'm looking forward to a couple PRs from markelog
[12:27:34] <markelog> that's cool, glad to hear it still currency (not that i had the impression it wasn't)
[12:27:47] <markelog> i do them every day these days
[12:28:03] <markelog> yesterday was one for the migrate
[12:28:04] <markelog> also
[12:28:14] <markelog> it seems we can only one issue before releasing 2.2.1
[12:28:18] <markelog> and 1.12.
[12:28:19] <markelog> 1
[12:28:23] <markelog> that opera thing
[12:28:30] <m_gol> yup
[12:28:35] <markelog> if we can fix that we can release
[12:28:37] <timmywil> ah right. I think it's a test issue, but I need to dig into it.
[12:28:46] <m_gol> most likely but better to be sure :)
[12:28:50] <timmywil> yea
[12:29:00] <markelog> i also will check out ie9 thingy
[12:29:03] <m_gol> a dead browser talking
[12:29:05] <markelog> today
[12:29:07] <m_gol> that was about Opera 12 :)
[12:29:16] <markelog> and do the show/hide tomorrow
[12:29:21] <timmywil> great
[12:29:34] <m_gol> markelog: did you resign from a day job? ;-)
[12:29:35] <timmywil> anything else? I'm deferring some things for when Dave is here.
[12:29:48] <m_gol> As for my lowercasing PR - do we want to try to support SVG here? You asked about it, timmywil.
[12:30:06] <markelog> m_gol: just cool time management technic i'm applying
[12:30:13] <m_gol> :)
[12:30:18] <timmywil> oh yea. did you happen to try that SVG case in the issue?
[12:30:19] <markelog> it is call "work, and forget about personal life"
[12:30:36] <markelog> *called
[12:30:44] <m_gol> markelog: :)
[12:30:49] <m_gol> I didn't try, it will require some time to try it in every browser and we need to think if that's enough
[12:30:58] <m_gol> also, it'd be good to hear what others think
[12:31:06] <m_gol> about supporting it in any way
[12:31:33] <markelog> we decided to close https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2895 right?
[12:31:40] <markelog> and replace it with general issue?
[12:31:48] <timmywil> I have some experience with manipulating SVG attributes. Now that I think about it, I don't think we can support it.
[12:32:01] <timmywil> some attributes require a special namespace
[12:32:16] <m_gol> yeah, I thought sth like that will interfere :)
[12:32:51] <timmywil> but not all. just the ones that look like something:xmlns
[12:33:00] <m_gol> yeah
[12:33:12] <m_gol> like xlink:href
[12:33:13] <m_gol> so do you think about supporting the regular ones?
[12:33:42] <timmywil> I think the regular ones will work, but rather than saying we support it, I'd go with saying, "use at your own risk"
[12:33:45] <m_gol> markelog: I think it can be closed, no one expressed the need for offsetParent replacement and the rest will be handled by my remove-lowercasing PR
[12:34:05] <markelog> don't remember what Dave said
[12:34:12] <m_gol> timmywil: my PR should be fine then? without the test changes
[12:34:16] <timmywil> yea
[12:34:19] <m_gol> k
[12:34:20] <timmywil> sounds good
[12:34:41] <m_gol> someone reported a related PR
[12:34:42] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2923
[12:34:49] <m_gol> to backport the getBoundingClientRect changes to 2.2
[12:35:04] <m_gol> I don't think we should do it but I wanted to run it through you before closing
[12:35:11] <timmywil> oh yea, I'm on board with your assessment m_gol
[12:35:24] <m_gol> this PR was motivated by plans to remove offset* APIs from Chrome 50
[12:35:26] <timmywil> meant to comment
[12:35:58] <m_gol> but since it's unsupported I'd rather say to people "upgrade to 3.0 if you want that to work, no promises, though"
[12:36:15] <timmywil> agreed
[12:36:19] <m_gol> k, thx
[12:36:29] <m_gol> should I comment+close?
[12:36:39] <timmywil> that'd be great
[12:36:41] <m_gol> k
[12:36:47] <markelog> you mean  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2895
[12:36:48] <markelog> ?
[12:37:04] <markelog> sorry, i was afk
[12:37:14] <timmywil> pull/2923
[12:37:53] <markelog> ok-ok, sorry
[12:39:07] <markelog> okay, i'm gonna close that, but before that i will check with Dave just in case
[12:39:07] <timmywil> thanks guys.
[12:39:12] <markelog> timmywil
[12:39:19] <markelog> to get it straight
[12:39:19] <timmywil> markelog: cool
[12:39:32] <markelog> you will check out opera and then release 2.2.1
[12:39:34] <markelog> right?
[12:39:43] <markelog> *opera ticket
[12:39:50] <timmywil> yea, if all goes well
[12:40:06] <markelog> cool-cool
[12:40:45] <m_gol> I keep hearing about this YUICompressor issue
[12:41:00] <m_gol> that it breaks on throws variable names
[12:41:21] <m_gol> the problem is they have no modes, they basically reject all keywords not recognized by ES3
[12:41:36] <timmywil> sounds like an issue with yui
[12:41:41] <m_gol> this library is quite knowns, although waaaaaaay less popular than Uglify
[12:41:50] <m_gol> yeah, but sometimes we cater to minifier bugs
[12:41:54] <markelog> yeah, it is basically dead right?
[12:41:54] <m_gol> I thought about it
[12:41:58] <timmywil> they're going to need to update that eventually imo
[12:42:05] <markelog> that is same bug we fix it in 1.6
[12:42:11] <m_gol> but now that we don't support IE8 we may want to use more ES5-only constructs
[12:42:15] <markelog> or 1.7
[12:42:19] <m_gol> so we should probably keep ignoring it :-)
[12:42:33] <markelog> but we said, we not gonna keep that fix
[12:42:46] <markelog> let me find the ticket
[12:42:47] <timmywil> seems like more and more people are going to be using es5-only code that they expect to work with yui
[12:42:57] <m_gol> yeah
[12:43:12] <markelog> https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12158
[12:43:29] <markelog> We'll leave this quoted fix in for 1.8 but will remove it in the next minor/major release.
[12:43:33] <timmywil> yea, 4 years is a long time :P
[12:43:34] <markelog> that is a quote
[12:43:35] <m_gol> haha
[12:43:41] <m_gol> they have quite a lag :-)
[12:44:09] <m_gol> their issue redirects to their GitHub project page, lol
[12:44:15] <timmywil> anyway, gotta run
[12:44:22] <m_gol> k
[12:44:31] <timmywil> thanks you two. see you in -dev
[12:44:33] <m_gol> timmywil: when do you want to release 2.2.1/1.12.1?
[12:44:47] <timmywil> this week. I'll try for Wed
[12:44:50] <m_gol> k
[12:44:54] <m_gol> see you!
