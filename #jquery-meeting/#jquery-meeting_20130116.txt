[09:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov rxaviers
[09:00:12] <rxaviers> hello
[09:00:41] <gnarf> yup
[09:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry guys, I haven't put together an agenda yet.
[09:01:51] <mikesherov> hi
[09:02:44] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gonna try to make this pretty quick.
[09:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> We're holding off on grunt updates until there are stable versions.
[09:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers is working on porting the image generation for download builder into node.
[09:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov and petro are working on clip animations, and actually making progress :-)
[09:04:03] <rxaviers> correct, I have it working on node. I'm adapting themeRoller to use this (generate) instead of fetch.
[09:04:18] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: typically rc's are stable
[09:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Except for when they're totally hosed.
[09:04:30] <kborchers> sorry, here now
[09:04:30] <mikesherov> but rc5 is borked, right
[09:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> rc4 is borked, rc5 seems ok
[09:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> But we're going to wait.
[09:04:44] <mikesherov> OK
[09:04:50] <mikesherov> that makes sense
[09:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10.0 is scheduled to go live on Friday.
[09:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> I've started writing the upgrade guide, but still have quite a bit to do.
[09:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer doesn't have a good connection, so he's heading back to his hotel room now.
[09:06:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, plz just let me know when 1.10.0 is available, so I can test DB on stage using it
[09:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully he can do the final testing of the release script when he gets there.
[09:06:45] <rxaviers> If you could call my attention on IRC when that happens, it would be great
[09:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can we do the testing before the actual tag?
[09:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> Can you just point it at a fork?
[09:07:04] <rxaviers> all I could, I've done already, yeap.
[09:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Or just use 1.10.0-rc.1 for testing.
[09:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:07:41] <rxaviers> having it available just let me test some other minor things.
[09:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm frantically working on getting the plugins site launched right now, so I'm a bit distracted.
[09:08:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i can go through the dialog test suite coverage tonight if that helps
[09:08:16] <jzaefferer> Hey
[09:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: That'd be great. I'm not gonna hold up the release for that, but obviously getting it done would be good.
[09:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you do another dry run of the release script today?
[09:08:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 2.1.2 color needs to land
[09:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> Verify that the theme + docs are correct?
[09:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What changed?
[09:08:59] <gnarf> transparent
[09:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> Just the header info?
[09:09:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, anything else you need for the release? i have tonight and tomorrow night dedicated to UI work
[09:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We already have that in.
[09:09:21] <gnarf> k
[09:09:22] <scott_gonzalez> But we can pull in 2.1.2, might as well.
[09:09:32] <gnarf> i'll make a commit for it
[09:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> This is the list I have:
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> check themes version from release script
[09:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> check docs version from release script
[09:10:55] <jzaefferer> I can do an actual dry run, yeah. Though why look for docs? We're not including them, right?
[09:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> Handle multi-line commit messages for the changelog.
[09:10:59] <jzaefferer> Brb
[09:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Oh, right.
[09:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'll remove that from my list.
[09:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> Add core 1.9.
[09:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's a good task for someone to do today.
[09:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> And the last thing on the list is write the upgrade guide.
[09:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> So if someone can add jQuery 1.9.0 and jzaefferer can do another dry run, we should be god.
[09:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> *good
[09:12:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: can that happen tonight or you need it during the day today?
[09:12:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, its literally header changes :)
[09:12:40] <kborchers> if so i can jump on that before the dialog tests
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll be gods, not like the fuckers that work on core http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13220#comment:5 :-P
[09:12:59] <kborchers> LOL
[09:13:01] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: It can happen tonight.
[09:13:19] <kborchers> ok, put me down for that â€¦ basically just add that and check all tests, etc.?
[09:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano was hoping we could push the release up a day.
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like that might be possible.
[09:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: yup
[09:13:40] <kborchers> kk
[09:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> It replaces 1.8.3 in the root, adds to the million versions in tests and changes the deafult in jquery.js
[09:14:18] <kborchers> yep, ok
[09:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> Just search for 1.8.3 and you should find all the many places that need updates :-)
[09:14:27] <kborchers> cool
[09:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully gnarf and I can get the plugins site out soon and I'll have time to work on UI this afternoon/tonight.
[09:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I think next week we'll hit 1M downloads from the new download builder.
[09:15:35] <kborchers> wow!
[09:15:39] <jzaefferer> kborchers: The wiki page for releases now includes details for doing a dry run. Would be good if you could do one.
[09:16:12] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, will do
[09:16:41] <jzaefferer> Change the repo variable! Don't be as stupid as I was.
[09:16:48] <kborchers> :D
[09:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, anyone have anything else?
[09:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> Let's aim for a release tomorrow since it seems like we can probably pull that off.
[09:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Let rxaviers know when you do the 1.9.0 update so he can update download builder.
[09:21:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: will do. probably pretty late tonight for him though.
[09:21:41] <kborchers> rxaviers: you're in brazil right?
[09:21:59] <rxaviers> :) yeap BRT -2:00 right now with dyl savings
[09:22:22] <kborchers> ok, it'll be pretty late but hopefully waiting for you in the morning :)
[09:22:30] <rxaviers> cool ok
