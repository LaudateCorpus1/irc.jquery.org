[09:01:09] <arthurvr> hi
[09:01:26] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:02:16] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket/PR count is pretty stable.
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz, jzaefferer: What's the status of button?
[09:03:11] <arschmitz> i pushed all the updated from the pr review
[09:03:33] <arschmitz> im updating it to use amd loading for the tests now
[09:04:29] <jzaefferer> I can review that tomorrow
[09:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of AMD loading for tests...
[09:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> TestSwarm doesn't support AMD.
[09:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I don't think our schedules work together until Friday.
[09:05:41] <jzaefferer> schedules?
[09:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> So we can work on it together Friday morning ET.
[09:05:51] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> You won't be around after dev leads, right?
[09:05:58] <jzaefferer> yep
[09:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be at Intel tomorrow morning and at the tattoo shop in the afternoon.
[09:08:09] <jzaefferer> I can update my classes docs PR for the other widgets, now that Alex reviewed my list
[09:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did you want to do another round of review on classes docs or are you good with it?
[09:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to do another review of it today.
[09:08:45] <arschmitz> ill do another quick once over but i think it was good
[09:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> I have a meeting with Dylan this afternoon to go over the tooltip live region issues.
[09:10:00] <scott_gonzalez> From the discussion we've had so far, it sounds like we may just end up with even more code to work around stupid issues.
[09:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm hoping that we can find something else in our meeting.
[09:10:23] <arschmitz> cool
[09:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> I swear supporting screen readers is worse than supporting IE6.
[09:11:07] <arschmitz> often seems that way
[09:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to selectmenu max-height.
[09:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> I started working on this last week, but didn't make much progress.
[09:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> Menu didn't seem to be recognizing that it had height at the right time.
[09:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep working on that.
[09:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> I missed a few days due to strep throat :-/
[09:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:13:57] <jzaefferer> I'd like to get some input on my docs issues
[09:14:11] <jzaefferer> like this checklist for the upgrade guide: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/107
[09:14:39] <jzaefferer> y'all should get notifications for the new issues, so no need to actually discuss them here...
[09:14:54] <arthurvr> gotta leave guysâ€¦ bye.
[09:15:04] <jzaefferer> Any news on Trac update?
[09:15:10] <jzaefferer> I could do without all the trac spam...
[09:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping the Trac team again.
[09:18:04] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:18:08] <jzaefferer> looks like that's all for today
[09:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
