[10:01:45] <slayslot> hi
[10:03:23] <sfrisk> Welcome to another fun and exciting Chassis meeting!
[10:03:30] <noufal> lol
[10:03:45] <geekman-rohit> yay
[10:03:46] <slayslot> hear hear
[10:03:59] <sfrisk> So we have a bunch of things up on the agenda, including a lot of open PRs
[10:04:33] <noufal> Meter Styling PR is assign to in our previous meeting.
[10:04:40] <noufal> to me*
[10:04:57] <sfrisk> You submitted a Pull Request, so I'm having people review it
[10:05:12] <noufal> oky
[10:05:25] <sfrisk> Please review current open PRs and leave any notes you may have on them, I know I have some stuff I need to change for the palette issue I'm working on
[10:06:06] <sfrisk> That includes Meter Styling, Chassis Palette (which I need to rework), Table Styling, and Typography
[10:06:37] <geekman-rohit> is there a demo on view.css-chassis for meter styling PR?
[10:07:04] <noufal> No maybe!
[10:07:06] <sfrisk> I don't think so, I'll get that set up after the meeting
[10:07:32] <noufal> Can I submit a PR on Table styling?
[10:07:49] <sfrisk> there is already a PR on table styling
[10:08:14] <geekman-rohit> and its GOOD. I love what michaelarestad is doing with tables
[10:08:23] <sfrisk> that list in the agenda of open pull requests are pull requests that are currently open, that have not been closed or added to Chassis yet
[10:08:33] <sfrisk> noufal: see here https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pulls
[10:08:52] <geekman-rohit> on that note, where is everyone else!!
[10:09:05] <sfrisk> You can see what Micheal did here: http://view.css-chassis.com/table/demos/tables.html
[10:09:39] <sfrisk> I know arschmitz is busy today, geekman-rohit, not sure about michealarestad
[10:09:46] <arschmitz> hey sorry
[10:09:47] <arschmitz> hi
[10:10:00] <sfrisk> but a lot of us have full time jobs, so it's possible he couldn't get onto IRC
[10:10:07] <geekman-rohit> hey arschmitz
[10:10:16] <arschmitz> im kinda here in a call
[10:10:45] <sfrisk> Although on that note of "where are people," full time job is sending me on a fun and exciting business trip next week
[10:10:51] <sfrisk> filled with many client meetings
[10:11:07] <sfrisk> so I will be unavailable for the Chassis meeting, I've asked arschmitz to run it in my place
[10:11:23] <sfrisk> You probably won't see my on IRC much during the week either
[10:11:31] <sfrisk> see me m*
[10:11:34] <sfrisk> no m
[10:11:35] <sfrisk> I can't type
[10:11:49] <noufal> I made the changes as u mention.
[10:12:47] <sfrisk> The comments arthurvr just made? Then comment on the your meter PR that you've updated them, noufal
[10:13:03] <arthurvr> noufal: sorry for all the nitpicking :D
[10:13:16] <sfrisk> arthurvr: KEEPER OF THE STYLE GUIDE
[10:13:21] <sfrisk> ASSIMILATE, ASSIMILATE
[10:13:28] <arthurvr> haha
[10:13:53] <noufal> hahahaha its oky :)
[10:14:15] <sfrisk> so arschmitz, after your call, can we discuss the two open PRs for performance testing?
[10:14:16] <noufal> It help me in my professional life :P
[10:14:45] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk 3*
[10:14:57] <sfrisk> three*
[10:15:10] <sfrisk> Sarah can totally count!
[10:15:16] <arschmitz> sure
[10:15:25] <arschmitz> they are both waiting on the same thing
[10:15:51] <arschmitz> which is  me moving everything to use local files
[10:16:38] <sfrisk> If I can help you with that, let me know.  I'm going to be spending a lot of time in airports next week.
[10:16:43] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz will those files be in the repo or downloaded on install?
[10:18:06] <noufal> arthurvr: how I correct the intendation?
[10:18:49] <arthurvr> noufal: we use tabs, some of your code uses 2 spaces. (not really topic for meeting, letâ€™s talk about it in #css-chassis after the meeting)
[10:19:16] <sfrisk> noufal, arthurvr, discussions on the details of the styling of the PR would probably be best suited to #css-chassis or on the issue iteself
[10:19:20] <sfrisk> rather than in the middle of the meeting
[10:19:38] <arthurvr> yup. totally agree
[10:19:38] <noufal> sorry
[10:19:46] <arschmitz> ok off call
[10:20:09] <arschmitz> where are we lol?
[10:20:40] <sfrisk> about finished talking about open PRs that need review
[10:20:58] <sfrisk> micheal isn't around, so we can't quite discuss typography and tables
[10:21:02] <arschmitz> ok
[10:21:13] <sfrisk> I thought he had a few things to add into typography before we pull it in
[10:21:33] <arschmitz> yeah i seem to recall that
[10:22:00] <sfrisk> Okay, so since there isn't much we can discuss with open PRs, onto issues
[10:22:08] <sfrisk> any process on the HTML Style Guide?
[10:22:32] <slayslot> I have a question about it
[10:22:58] <slayslot> common options that have to be used with htmllinting?
[10:23:18] <arschmitz> slayslot: ignore that it was my comment
[10:23:22] <arschmitz> and its not valid
[10:23:25] <arschmitz> there are no options
[10:24:37] <slayslot> so what do I state in the linting section of the guide??
[10:24:51] <arschmitz> that it should pass validation using vnu
[10:25:36] <arschmitz> using either https://html5.validator.nu/
[10:25:46] <arschmitz> or the grunt-html grunt task
[10:26:20] <slayslot> anything else that I should include ?
[10:26:45] <arschmitz> i dont have it in front of me but it should be valid html5 not xhtml
[10:26:55] <arschmitz> meaning <input> not <input/>
[10:27:13] <arschmitz> and anything else thats in the pr / existing style guide
[10:27:17] <arschmitz> not pr but issue
[10:28:16] <slayslot> alright
[10:28:28] <slayslot> Linting was the only section I was left with
[10:29:27] <sfrisk> :-)
[10:30:01] <sfrisk> Also on the topic of style guides
[10:30:38] <sfrisk> I creating an issue for the BEM style guide, so we can be clear about how we want or naming conventions to work
[10:31:04] <sfrisk> and also if anyone has any SCSS specific notes for the SCSS issue, add them up now, because I might be typing that up on a plane next wee
[10:31:06] <sfrisk> k
[10:32:00] <sfrisk> I've also created some issues for the radio,checkbox, and select elements we need that are supported with Javascript
[10:32:07] <sfrisk> to have jQuery UI and Mobile support for phase one
[10:32:22] <arschmitz> cool
[10:32:24] <sfrisk> as well as an issue for some of the alternate table styling that we discussed last week
[10:32:33] <arschmitz> sounds good also
[10:35:41] <sfrisk> Alternate table styling code should probably wait for the table styling PR to land
[10:36:00] <sfrisk> but we can continue discussions from last week in that issue, and anything specific we want to adress
[10:36:05] <arschmitz> i think so
[10:36:13] <sfrisk> address*
[10:38:00] <sfrisk> Okay, any other notes I really had to address this meeting, involve marestad
[10:38:10] <sfrisk> and since he's not online today, I can't really do much there
[10:39:06] <sfrisk> anyone have any other meeting related notes?
[10:40:18] <noufal> no
[10:48:24] <arthurvr> nope :D
[10:49:21] <sfrisk> okay then I say the meeting is over!
[10:49:25] <sfrisk> see you in #css-chassis
[10:49:33] <arthurvr> byeee everybody
