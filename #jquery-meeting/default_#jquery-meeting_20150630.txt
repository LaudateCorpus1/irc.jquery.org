[10:17:05] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[10:17:35] <arschmitz> hi
[10:17:36] <arthurvr> Hey! Not around today. The meeting overlaps with a meeting with the polymer team today. Sorry!
[10:17:37] <sfrisk> arthurvr, arschmitz, geekman-rohit, kristyjy
[10:17:43] <sfrisk> That's okay, arthurvr
[10:17:51] <sfrisk> Totally understand (I've been in meetings like half today)
[10:18:37] <geekman-rohit> hey!
[10:18:44] <kristyjy> hello :)
[10:19:52] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:20:05] <sfrisk> working on getting an agenda together
[10:20:47] <sfrisk> (sorry, only just sat down at my desk after a few hours of meetings)
[10:21:34] <sfrisk> First off jQuerySF went well, had some people seem pretty interested in Chassis
[10:23:58] <kristyjy> yay!
[10:24:35] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:28:08] <sfrisk> is michealarestad around?
[10:29:22] <sfrisk> I noticed arschmitz you were doing some stuff with jsass today
[10:29:35] <arschmitz> just fixed one comment i had missed
[10:30:01] <arschmitz> no one besides arthurvr has reviewed it
[10:30:31] <sfrisk> yeah, I owe you a more thorough review - sorry
[10:30:36] <sfrisk> last two weeks have been crazy
[10:31:07] <sfrisk> I also need to merge the CSS comments comments
[10:31:18] <sfrisk> How is the style guide for scss coming, kristyjy?
[10:31:58] <kristyjy> I've worked a bit more on it but I decided to start on the mixin for media queries so I could do a better job of using examples in the style guide
[10:32:30] <kristyjy> I'm almost ready to make a PR for the media query mixin but wanted some opinions from others on how complex of media queries it should support
[10:32:50] <kristyjy> keep meaning to pop in here and ask but things have been busy lately. Plan to do it this week
[10:32:52] <sfrisk> what do you have so for in the media query mixin?
[10:33:47] <kristyjy> it supports sending values for min-width, max-width using both or separate and it also uses variables to decide if it should print the media query the code passed in the media query or nothing
[10:33:58] <kristyjy> based on our discussion about excluding media queries for some builds
[10:36:17] <sfrisk> cool, well if you want anyone to look it over before PR, you can always throw it up on a gist and we can check it out in css-chassis
[10:36:57] <arschmitz> a pr is better
[10:37:02] <arschmitz> even just for a wip
[10:37:09] <arschmitz> because you can comment on specific lines
[10:37:14] <arschmitz> and have history
[10:37:32] <sfrisk> true
[10:37:35] <sfrisk> good point
[10:37:36] <kristyjy> okay that's cool then I'll put a PR in tonight then
[10:37:40] <sfrisk> awesome
[10:38:38] <sfrisk> Also, reminder please review jsass-vars (you too, sfrisk), so we can move forward on that
[10:38:49] <sfrisk> also if anyone wants to pick up form elements/buttons/etc
[10:39:04] <sfrisk> although we might want to talk about what kind of base styling/flavor we're going for
[10:39:22] <sfrisk> we have time, so geekman-rohit, if you're available we can discuss themeroller
[10:39:28] <geekman-rohit> yep
[10:39:55] <geekman-rohit> I have a few issues to bring up, here or in css-chassis?
[10:40:54] <sfrisk> we normally do your discussions in css-chassis, so it might make sense to just move over there
[10:41:02] <geekman-rohit> sure
[10:41:04] <sfrisk> Can anyone think of anything else that I forgot to bring up?
[10:42:32] <sfrisk> going once
[10:42:34] <sfrisk> going twice
[10:42:41] <sfrisk> okay, see everyone in #css-chassis
