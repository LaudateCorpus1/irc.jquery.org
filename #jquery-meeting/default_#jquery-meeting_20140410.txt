[11:02:19] <gseguin> yay! uGoMobi found a way to the internets!
[11:02:27] <uGoMobi> tethering :P
[11:03:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: WB!
[11:03:12] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:03:13] <arschmitz> hi
[11:03:15] <cgack> hey
[11:03:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, you hooked up the t00bs just right, eh?
[11:03:28] <uGoMobi> this is a nightmare... I feel amputated without internet
[11:03:39] <_|Nix|_> There there
[11:04:13] <uGoMobi> they said they come back tomorrow to install dsl (fingers crossed)
[11:05:13] <uGoMobi> can somebody make a new tab in the agenda
[11:05:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: should have moved to finland with _|Nix|_ where highspeed internet is a right!
[11:05:59] <agcolom> Hi
[11:06:16] <uGoMobi> hehe... and you just tell me that now arschmitz ;-)
[11:06:20] <arschmitz> its also very cold though so take the good with the bad
[11:06:21] <uGoMobi> hey agcolom
[11:06:39] <_|Nix|_> ... and dark in the winter - OTOH, white nights during the summer.
[11:07:04] <_|Nix|_> ... and bonfires on midsummer night's eve.
[11:07:22] <gseguin> uGoMobi: done!
[11:07:30] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:08:39] <uGoMobi> they gave me 1Gb extra mobile data usage so that's how long this meeting can last ;-)
[11:08:56] <uGoMobi> what do we have?
[11:10:12] <_|Nix|_> A lot of stuff is carried over from last week. Not sure what to do about those.
[11:10:27] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I duplicated the tab
[11:10:36] <uGoMobi> yeah, I was just going over it
[11:10:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, I know, but maybe we should get rid of some items that are closed.
[11:10:49] <gseguin> we need to clean-up what landed last week
[11:10:50] <uGoMobi> don't think we need to repeat everything
[11:11:22] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: 'xactly
[11:11:30] <_|Nix|_> Got ridda mine.
[11:11:37] <uGoMobi> PR labels --> I will take care of this next week
[11:12:18] <uGoMobi> page events demo...
[11:12:25] <gseguin> cleaned up mine
[11:12:30] <gseguin> still have one in flight
[11:12:54] <uGoMobi> did we make a decision about pulling the page events plugin in the library?
[11:13:08] <arschmitz> yeah i think so we are not going to
[11:14:09] <uGoMobi> ok, I noted that in the agenda. we can remove the topic for next week
[11:14:20] <uGoMobi> we still have the bugs though
[11:14:33] <uGoMobi> we decided to fix those for 1.4.3
[11:14:43] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:14:49] <uGoMobi> any update about at the moment?
[11:14:54] <arschmitz> yup i pushed a branch for that but its not ready yet
[11:14:58] <_|Nix|_> That's actually quite a doosie
[11:15:03] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:15:07] <arschmitz> there is also a branch and pr for the api docs
[11:15:29] <uGoMobi> great
[11:15:49] <arschmitz> i took the approach of marking the pageevents that were not deprecated already in 1.4.0 deprecated in 1.4.3 but not being removed until 1.6.0
[11:16:12] <arschmitz> so people have as much warning as possible since the replacments will be in place
[11:16:54] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, maybe we should just drop all deprecated page events in 1.6.0.
[11:16:54] <arschmitz> so its the same in practice if we just waited and did it in 1.5.0
[11:17:00] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:17:30] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[11:17:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the way i set up triggerWithDeprecated it makes little difference
[11:17:50] <uGoMobi> maybe we should just deprecate in 1.4 (not in 1.4.x)?
[11:17:56] <arschmitz> so whatever we think is best
[11:18:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should give one full minor version development cycle ... *shrug*
[11:18:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and so, since we're mid-cycle, it'd end up being 1.5 cycles.
[11:19:08] <uGoMobi> right
[11:19:08] <_|Nix|_> ... i.e., until 1.6.
[11:19:15] <_|Nix|_> Should be OK.
[11:19:24] <uGoMobi> we can't deprecate in 1.4.3 and remove in 1.5
[11:19:34] <uGoMobi> 1.4.3 could even be released after 1.5.0
[11:19:37] <arschmitz> right
[11:19:37] * gseguin will be back in 10
[11:19:38] <uGoMobi> technically
[11:20:19] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... it's a bit tough. If you mark something as deprecated, people will assume it will be removed in the next minor version.
[11:20:29] <_|Nix|_> I dunno how we can avoid that impression.
[11:20:40] <arschmitz> not when the bix yellow box says otherwise
[11:20:43] <_|Nix|_> I mean, we have the warning blurbs.
[11:21:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's the only place where we can actually specify when we will remove something.
[11:21:49] <arschmitz> which makes sense like core has things that are deprecated but not being removed
[11:21:53] <arschmitz> like support
[11:21:53] <_|Nix|_> So, we gotta make sure we have a warning blurb for each.
[11:22:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in that branch i use the same thing you did already but made a second saying 1.4.3 and 1.6
[11:22:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... maybe we should move the removal for all page events to 1.6.
[11:22:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Make a clean break.
[11:23:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does not matter to me
[11:23:26] <arschmitz> the change to our code is super minor
[11:23:37] <arschmitz> and effects nothing else
[11:23:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think? I vote in favour of removing /all/ deprecated page events in 1.6.0.
[11:24:20] <uGoMobi> one sec, I'll check arschmitz's spreadsheet again
[11:25:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, i agree
[11:25:22] <uGoMobi> wait until 1.6
[11:25:31] <arschmitz> ok ill update my pr
[11:25:47] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:25:52] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:27:08] <uGoMobi> about select menu
[11:27:24] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/select-fallback/demos/selectmenu-custom/ doesn't load anymore
[11:28:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is that because of work in progress?
[11:28:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: work in progress lol
[11:28:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:29:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah no updates or anything to look at there this week
[11:29:23] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:29:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: any updates regarding swipe / pointer events?
[11:30:25] <arschmitz> nope hopefully will have more answers there soon though
[11:30:48] <arschmitz> our use case meets all their requirments
[11:30:59] <arschmitz> so there is a chance we might get them to make a change
[11:31:24] <uGoMobi> that would be awesome
[11:31:33] <arschmitz> its just a matter i guess of if they wish to support such a use case because it does have some inconsistencies across browsers
[11:31:59] <arschmitz> like on ios it wont happen until after scrolling ends
[11:32:28] <arschmitz> but firefox starts immediately but continues the scroll
[11:32:57] <arschmitz> and desktop happens smoothly and scrolling is a non issue
[11:33:48] <arschmitz> the whole thing is its not a bug they did this intentionally and for a number of reasons they outline
[11:34:06] <arschmitz> performances and scroll jank being the 2 big ones
[11:34:09] * gseguin is back
[11:34:11] <uGoMobi> yeah, I saw the doc
[11:34:16] <uGoMobi> welcome back gseguin
[11:34:32] <arschmitz> but our use would not be an issue for other thing
[11:34:45] <arschmitz> we dont need to be able to stop the scroll or prevent default
[11:35:02] <agcolom> where's that documented?
[11:35:08] <arschmitz> we just want to get the events
[11:35:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: where is what documented?
[11:35:20] <agcolom> (is that public?)
[11:35:39] <agcolom> the issue you're talking about
[11:36:01] <arschmitz> oh https://docs.google.com/document/d/12k_LL_Ot9GjF8zGWP9eI_3IMbSizD72susba0frg44Y/edit
[11:36:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was refering to https://docs.google.com/document/d/12k_LL_Ot9GjF8zGWP9eI_3IMbSizD72susba0frg44Y/edit
[11:36:18] <uGoMobi> (link is in the agenda)
[11:36:25] <agcolom> great thanks
[11:37:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if they don't make the change we can't make swipe work on android 4.4?
[11:38:14] <arschmitz> not in the way we think of it
[11:38:53] <arschmitz> because anything you bound to you could not start a scroll on ever
[11:39:10] <arschmitz> so if you bound swipe to the body ie swipe navigation
[11:39:17] <arschmitz> then you could never scroll at all
[11:39:40] <gseguin> hmm... interesting
[11:39:49] <arschmitz> or even like the swipe list you could make it so you could swipe the items
[11:40:00] <arschmitz> but you would not be able to start a scroll on any item
[11:40:11] <arschmitz> ( since its a full page list this would be hard )
[11:40:29] <_|Nix|_> Hold on a sec. Correct me if I'm wrong: The problem only arises if you prevent default on a mouse event, rigth?
[11:40:32] <arschmitz> but for a single small element it might be ok
[11:40:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no
[11:40:43] <_|Nix|_> No?
[11:40:56] <_|Nix|_> Does it happen if you so much as attach a handler?
[11:41:12] <arschmitz> the problem is if you DONT preventDefault on the touchstart or first touch move you will no longer get touchMove events
[11:42:07] <arschmitz> but preventing default on touchmove or touchstart means no scrolling
[11:42:10] <_|Nix|_> OK, that's just terrible, because at that point you don't have enough information as to whether the user is moving their finger horizontally or vertically.
[11:42:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right hence we cant support both scrolling and swipe on any version of chrome
[11:43:16] <_|Nix|_> Ummm, isn't this also gonna break the scrolling for the slider? Like, if you try to scroll the page and you happen to put your finger on a slider button, it won't scroll the page?
[11:43:39] <gseguin> well that's crap! who do we fire?
[11:44:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: think it already does that intentionally
[11:44:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah we will see what happens im pleading our case
[11:45:13] <_|Nix|_> I think it's dumb. It basically prevents anyone from doing anything based on mouse input - unless the whole app is dedicated to processing that mouse input, and so takes care to not render anything bigger than the viewport.
[11:45:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not mouse
[11:45:30] <arschmitz> this is only about touch
[11:45:48] <_|Nix|_> Touch then.
[11:46:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and yes that is correct
[11:46:14] <_|Nix|_> Whatever happend to touchcancel?
[11:46:26] <arschmitz> how would that help?
[11:47:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if you don't prevent default on that, it starts to scroll - but I guess that's what causes the jerk at the beginning of the scroll.
[11:47:28] <arschmitz> you cant prevent default on touchcancel
[11:47:41] <_|Nix|_> In a way it's an information theoretical problem. You have too little information to decide what action the user wishes to take.
[11:48:01] <_|Nix|_> The interface is just not expressive enough.
[11:48:55] <_|Nix|_> The only UI way out is to click a button that places you into swipe mode, and then click it again to return to scroll mode.
[11:49:09] <uGoMobi> it would really be a pitty if they don't want to make the chance, but let's wait for what they decide first
[11:49:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah something like that
[11:49:30] <uGoMobi> thanks for pleading our case arschmitz
[11:49:42] <arschmitz> its not just us
[11:49:49] <arschmitz> there are many issues and threads about this
[11:50:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, I just did a quick search
[11:50:42] <arschmitz> one thing thats different with us to is they recomend a scroll workaround
[11:50:51] <arschmitz> but we actually dont care about scrolling at all
[11:51:02] <arschmitz> we care about horizontal distance
[11:51:12] <arschmitz> which there is no other analog event for
[11:51:36] <arschmitz> so there is truly no work around for our situation like a lot of the others
[11:52:05] <uGoMobi> yeah :(
[11:52:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I see you made progress with buildCSSBundle
[11:52:46] <gseguin> indeed
[11:52:55] <uGoMobi> ncie
[11:53:01] <uGoMobi> nice even
[11:53:02] <gseguin> it's pushed and it seems to be working
[11:53:13] <uGoMobi> great
[11:53:22] <gseguin> I'm preparing to publish to npm
[11:53:27] <gseguin> probably later today
[11:54:10] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:54:17] <uGoMobi> last item on the agenda... Create filterable upon listview create
[11:54:22] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:54:47] <_|Nix|_> If you look at the bug, in 1.3.x the filterable behaviour was instantiated simply by creating a listview.
[11:54:58] <_|Nix|_> In 1.4.x you have to also instantiate a filterable.
[11:55:00] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6911
[11:55:22] <_|Nix|_> So, I would have to modify listview to look for data-filter="true" and instantiate a filterable on itself to be fully backcompat with 1.3.x.
[11:55:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so this about the backcompat code
[11:55:34] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:55:53] <_|Nix|_> I've been hoping to confine backcompat code to the filterable.backcompat.js module.
[11:56:05] <_|Nix|_> However, it seems that I'll have to put some backcompat code into listview as well.
[11:56:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: still can
[11:56:16] <_|Nix|_> ... to handle the dynamically-instantiated case.
[11:56:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just extend listview in that same file
[11:56:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess that's not bad.
[11:56:49] <arschmitz> its all code for filterable backcompat so it can be in same file
[11:57:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, good idea!
[11:57:02] <arschmitz> just because it modifies 2 different objects does not mean anything
[11:57:04] <_|Nix|_> I'll do it that way.
[11:57:19] <uGoMobi> nice solution
[11:57:30] <_|Nix|_> OK. That was a quick one.
[11:57:33] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:58:35] <uGoMobi> agcolom cgack anything you want to discuss
[11:58:37] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:58:53] <cgack> Just thanks to _|Nix|_ for working with my PRs
[11:59:15] <cgack> and I've convinced my employer to give me a day a week to help out as needed
[11:59:24] <_|Nix|_> cgack: Aweseom!
[11:59:24] <uGoMobi> hehe that's awesome!
[11:59:31] <agcolom> nope
[11:59:41] <agcolom> cgack: that's great!
[11:59:49] <uGoMobi> thanks to your employer cgack !
[12:00:07] <cgack> indeed
[12:00:20] <agcolom> cgack: have you spoken to Kris. Your employer can probably get some recognition for that
[12:00:22] <arschmitz> cgack: awesome!
[12:00:27] <_|Nix|_> I've been doing a lot more triage lately.
[12:00:44] <gseguin> cgack: that's awesome!
[12:00:47] <uGoMobi> nice _|Nix|_
[12:00:50] <cgack> I haven't yet gotten with Kris about this, but I hope to
[12:01:16] <uGoMobi> I am going to make sure I am back online next week
[12:01:47] <uGoMobi> first have to finish some CSS framework work but then I will crank on triage too
[12:02:36] <uGoMobi> sorry again for slacking
[12:02:42] <uGoMobi> I'll be back :P
[12:02:58] <uGoMobi> so anything else we need to discuss?
[12:04:12] <uGoMobi> I guess not :)
[12:04:32] <arschmitz> oh i had one thing
[12:04:37] <uGoMobi> sure
[12:04:42] <arschmitz> just remembered
[12:04:56] <arschmitz> iv been seeing some comments about a query params plugin some one made
[12:05:14] <uGoMobi> a new one?
[12:05:20] <arschmitz> yes for 1.4
[12:05:29] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:05:33] <arschmitz> and it got me thinking about demos with 3rd party code
[12:05:45] <arschmitz> and that we should establish standards for these
[12:06:03] <uGoMobi> what standards do you mean?
[12:06:18] <arschmitz> for example maybe require them to be listed on the plugins site
[12:06:26] <arschmitz> or havr a certain level of documentation
[12:06:28] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:06:35] <arschmitz> things like that
[12:06:41] <uGoMobi> good point
[12:06:52] <arschmitz> but encourage some of the bigger ones to do this or more useful ones
[12:06:59] <arschmitz> this would include my own we have
[12:07:00] <uGoMobi> maybe we this should be added to the contributing guidelines?
[12:07:08] <uGoMobi> in a section about demos
[12:07:15] <arschmitz> so like this query params one would be good
[12:07:28] <arschmitz> and there is a super popular bootstrap theme
[12:07:40] <uGoMobi> so people know what we look at when reviewing PRs for 3rd party code demos
[12:07:51] <arschmitz> right
[12:08:01] <arschmitz> and also to try to fill out some better 3rd party demos
[12:08:10] <uGoMobi> but first we need to interest them for creating a PR
[12:08:28] <arschmitz> also we need to decide how best to list these in the menu and stuff the best way too
[12:08:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i bet most would do if if they have something specificly for jquery mobile
[12:08:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: they have an own section in the menu at the bottom
[12:09:09] <uGoMobi> but we can make it stand out a bit more
[12:09:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but i think some are important and would get lost there
[12:09:17] <uGoMobi> true
[12:09:19] <arschmitz> like query params is a big one
[12:09:27] <arschmitz> or the datepicker
[12:10:03] <uGoMobi> yeah, datepicker isn't in that submenu actually but you're right
[12:10:09] <uGoMobi> I'll look into this
[12:10:23] <uGoMobi> let's put it in the agenda too
[12:10:25] <arschmitz> i was also thinking that bigger ones that would not probably submit one might be worth some time making ourselves
[12:11:03] <arschmitz> like ember or angular and how to use them with jqm
[12:11:50] <cgack> so even a tutorials section almost?
[12:11:53] <uGoMobi> agreed
[12:12:02] <arschmitz> cgack: kinda
[12:12:13] <uGoMobi> yeah, although we do have the learn site
[12:12:19] <arschmitz> cgack: or maybe just like a tiny 3 or 4 page app
[12:12:32] <uGoMobi> have to watch out that we don't add content to the demos that actually belongs there
[12:12:32] <arschmitz> thats an example of how to do it
[12:12:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it depends if its more of a tutorial it should be on learn
[12:13:03] <arschmitz> if its more of a demo app it would be demos
[12:13:09] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:13:16] <uGoMobi> just something to be aware of
[12:13:58] <uGoMobi> ok let's wrap up here
[12:14:01] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[12:14:07] <_|Nix|_> L8R, all!
