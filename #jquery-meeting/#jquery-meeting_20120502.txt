[08:56:11] <bot-t> (69 hours 10 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell davemethvin also do you see any way to make this more efficient? Its a critical path: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/399/files
[08:56:12] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-validation by mlynch (1w, 1h ago): Moved to jQuery [name] lookup for findByName. Fixes #82
[08:57:00] <jzaefferer> hey DaveMethvin /o
[08:57:05] <jzaefferer>  /o\
[08:57:09] <DaveMethvin> hey
[08:57:14] <DaveMethvin> just reading that ticket
[08:57:19] <DaveMethvin> was traveling for a week
[08:57:41] <jzaefferer> looked like that :-)
[08:57:55] <jzaefferer> I guess you don't have OSX at hand either? iOS simulator etc
[08:58:04] <DaveMethvin> nope, just windows
[08:58:45] <jzaefferer> let's see if we can get the mobile guys to look into that
[08:59:04] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: thanks anyway for reopening
[08:59:10] <DaveMethvin> i like the way you think jzaefferer :)
[08:59:11] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:01:00] <jzaefferer> Something for the UI meeting: Fix the remaining issues to get this all green: http://swarm.jquery.org//job/26
[09:01:17] <rworth> hey
[09:01:23] <jzaefferer> About time! scott_gonzalez rworth gnarf kborchers danheberden Krinkle
[09:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[09:01:57] <Krinkle> yeah, we may have to split the test up or increase time out. IE is taking too long for some tests
[09:02:07] <Krinkle> (assuming the test itself runs fine, not sure about that)
[09:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> Why do we have new failures?
[09:02:22] <kborchers> i'm in another meeting so probably can't participate much
[09:02:26] <Krinkle> Tabs_deprecated is consistently timing out in IE6 and 7
[09:04:27] <jzaefferer> we weren't running deprecated tests before the move to node-testswarm
[09:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> Are you sure about that?
[09:05:08] <jzaefferer> not sure about the others; while there is a db backup before the 1.0.0 migration, there's no instance serving that data anymore
[09:05:23] <Krinkle> would it help?
[09:05:51] <jzaefferer> maybe
[09:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> Would what help? Removing the deprecated tests?
[09:06:56] <jzaefferer> its mostly failures in IE6; I haven't yet tried to reproduce them, dunno if anyone else did
[09:06:58] <Krinkle> I mean, would it help if we know what our previous testswarm reported
[09:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt it would help.
[09:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever's failing needs to be fixed, regardless of what was running/failing before.
[09:09:34] <jzaefferer> Running IE6 via BrowserStack and I get the same Core test failure
[09:09:44] <jzaefferer> So at least its not just via API or something
[09:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> The core failures in IE seems like the sync/async focus thing.
[09:10:11] <rworth> did someone modify last week's agenda before I duplicated it to make todays?
[09:11:19] <jzaefferer> looks like that
[09:11:26] <jzaefferer> though I didn't touch it
[09:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> That would be me.
[09:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> I forgot to duplicate before modifying. I got distracted between opening and modifying :-/
[09:12:04] <jzaefferer> position:within test fails in IE6
[09:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[09:12:15] <rworth> thanks
[09:13:14] <Krinkle> btw, where is this agenda you speak of?
[09:13:35] <rworth> see topic
[09:13:44] <Krinkle> oh..
[09:15:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: tabs_deprecated gets stuck at the last test, "tabs (deprecated): methods: abort" - there's also a few failures before that, in other deprecated tests
[09:15:29] <jzaefferer> anyway, looks like all those are reproducable, so we can fix them
[09:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:15:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what does that mean? "Update release to support running tests against a build"
[09:17:43] <jzaefferer> rworth: how far along is api.jquery.com?
[09:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> Run a build, then open any unit test page and click the "min" checkbox
[09:17:55] <rworth> api.jquery.com is staged with categories
[09:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> You'll get 404s for the theme files.
[09:18:01] <rworth> but not yet subcategories
[09:18:27] <rworth> grunt-wordpress has the support I need, working on generating a taxonomies.json from the category.xml files
[09:18:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ah, okay. Let's create a ticket for that?
[09:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:19:16] <jzaefferer> I need to take a look at the logic behind the min checkbox
[09:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/testsuite.js#L13
[09:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> It just loads dist/jquery-ui.min.*
[09:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that the images don't exist.
[09:20:55] <rworth> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/16
[09:20:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #16 on api.jquery.com (rdworth;  ago): Add support for category slugs, subcategories and category descriptions.
[09:21:07] <jzaefferer> Seems easy to fix, just make another copy of those images?
[09:21:22] <jzaefferer> The dist content is rather unstructured anyway
[09:21:44] <jzaefferer> I can take care of that right now
[09:21:51] <jzaefferer> If thats all that is missing
[09:22:08] <jzaefferer> Is there a test that fails due to missing images?
[09:22:11] <gnarf> ( sorry running late - here now )
[09:22:12] <kswedberg> rworth: btw, this is actually an issue for jQuery UI's docs, not api.jquery.com: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/15
[09:22:13] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #15 on api.jquery.com (Pypeline; 1d, 20h ago): Link points to wrong url in UI documentation
[09:22:24] <rworth> scott_gonzalez you want the xmlrpc resources ticket in web-base-template?
[09:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I don't think any tests fail, just 404s
[09:22:33] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:22:40] <jzaefferer> so get rid of 404s :-)
[09:23:04] <rworth> kswedberg actually, we're using api.jquery.com as a guinea pig :)
[09:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: No. If you're going to create a ticket for it, it belongs in grunt-wordpress.
[09:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> I've just been using TODOs, not issues.
[09:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> I already have the TODO added locally.
[09:23:42] <rworth> the TODO works in your head, I see ;)
[09:23:59] <jzaefferer> You mean Scott's HEAD?
[09:24:08] <kswedberg> rworth: ha. ok, cool. but still, take a look at that issue, because he's referring to  http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#option-animated
[09:24:35] <rworth> kswedberg sorry, I thought you referenced 16 not 15
[09:24:50] <kswedberg> gotcha. :)
[09:24:53] <rworth> will take a look, thanks
[09:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> That ticket needs to be closed.
[09:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> Only other item on the agenda is the fact that 1.8.20 was released.
[09:26:41] <kswedberg> closed
[09:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> Mostly for build fixes.
[09:30:48] <rworth> yay
[09:31:01] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[09:31:10] <rworth> for your sake scott_gonzalez I'm looking forward to a release free of svn for the release itself as well as the website
[09:31:26] <rworth> we're making progress on both fronts :)
[09:31:49] <rworth> only other thing I wanted to mention is I'm moving docs xml+xslt stuff we want to share to a qdoc project
[09:32:14] <rworth> starting with qunit docs as it is much simpler than core and UI, and is pure js
[09:32:31] <rworth> then I'll grow it to support documentation of jQuery methods, jQuery plugins, and widgets
[09:33:00] <rworth> that's it for me
