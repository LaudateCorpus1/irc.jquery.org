[10:03:52] <michaelarestad> Howdy
[10:03:55] <arschmitz> hi
[10:04:04] <sfrisk> How is everyone on this lovely Tuesday afternoon?
[10:04:18] <sfrisk> Schedule: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:05:14] <sfrisk> Okay, so big news today is that Javascript Summit is today
[10:05:34] <sfrisk> and arschmitz and I are doing a talk on Chassis at it - so hopefully we'll be getting a little more activity on the issues
[10:05:53] <ianmaffett> awesome!
[10:05:55] <michaelarestad> Rad!
[10:06:04] <arthurvr> Yay! Success!
[10:06:05] <arschmitz> First big public announcement
[10:06:08] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:06:11] <sfrisk> not nervous or anything
[10:06:20] <michaelarestad> NBD
[10:06:34] <sfrisk> Net Magazine has also asked for an article on Chassis, so I'm also in the process of working on that
[10:06:48] <sfrisk> I've also created a mailing list - just need to add everyone's address to it
[10:06:54] <arthurvr> Wow! good news. :-)
[10:06:59] <sfrisk> when with a forum type layout for it, as we discussed last week
[10:07:27] <sfrisk> I'll just add the email associated with your github account, unless anyone has an email they would prefer instead
[10:07:36] <sfrisk> in that case, just DM me the email you want to use
[10:09:28] <sfrisk> So I'll admit a lot of my focus the past week has been on the prep for the Javascript sumit, but the svg PR has landed
[10:09:31] <sfrisk> (yaaaaay)
[10:09:51] <sfrisk> although michaelarestad, I believe there are some comments on the file structure PR that need to be addressed
[10:09:51] <michaelarestad> Woo!!!
[10:10:32] <michaelarestad> There are. I've been pretty busy this last week to get a feature into WP core. Will try to get that done before next week. :/
[10:10:43] <arschmitz> i held off on the file structure pr since there were a lot of new comments after last meeting
[10:10:47] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:10:49] <sfrisk> No worries. I know what it's like being busy :-)
[10:11:13] <sfrisk> And on the busy note, arschmitz will be running next week's meeting since I'm getting shipped out to the midwest for work next week
[10:11:20] <sfrisk> and my access to the internet shall be iffy
[10:12:11] <sfrisk> (oh, if anyone wants to see the slides for JS summit: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_15yz1uT-oq17ZNsZTczGgwUh-TP15gGO6DFcz_XTJU/edit?usp=sharing)
[10:12:45] <sfrisk> Also, more logo designs from isaacdurazo https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/27#issuecomment-73313133
[10:12:57] <sfrisk> which are looking kinda awesome, and I think you guys should check them out
[10:13:08] <arthurvr> sfrisk: looks really nice. (both the slides and the logos)
[10:13:32] <arthurvr> Tho I like the blue one over the pink.
[10:13:54] <sfrisk> I know the logo colors aren't necessarily final, but I did use them for the slides
[10:15:03] <sfrisk> so, arschmitz, any news on the Perf side of things?
[10:15:11] <arschmitz> a little
[10:15:24] <arschmitz> i started cleaning up some things in that PR
[10:15:56] <arschmitz> added the jquery ui-1-12 build to the frameworks since theres some significant button changes there and would like to see if they have any effect
[10:16:35] <arschmitz> Also tried using both sauce labs and browserstack
[10:16:59] <arschmitz> sadly neither seem usable for this i was getting swings in framerate as big as 50%
[10:18:05] <arschmitz> so as i had already thought we will need a dedicated server where we can control the load for this
[10:18:24] <sfrisk> all the servers for the chassis cause
[10:18:25] <sfrisk> all of them
[10:19:19] <arschmitz> we have a jankins ci server already we can probably use
[10:19:30] <arschmitz> that we can control the load on
[10:20:32] <sfrisk> nice
[10:21:29] <arschmitz> thats about it there
[10:21:49] <arschmitz> still need to track down what about foundation makes it so slow so we know what not to do.
[10:22:05] <sfrisk> fun times
[10:22:56] <sfrisk> so not much else happened this week that needs discussion, other than we have submitted Chassis in with the jQuery Foundation for GSoC
[10:23:23] <sfrisk> (Google Summer of Code)
[10:24:48] <sfrisk> so you may have noticed some new faces in #css-chassis, asking around
[10:28:31] <sfrisk> So I really don't have anything else to discuss, does anyone else?
[10:28:40] <arschmitz> nope
[10:31:04] <sfrisk> okay then, so goals for this week - to the talk, add people to the mailing list, and when you get a chance, michaelarestad address the comments in the PR
[10:31:25] <sfrisk> I would like to be able to move onto typography and form stuff soonish
[10:31:32] <michaelarestad> Me too. :)
[10:32:53] <sfrisk> :-)
[10:32:56] <sfrisk> All the fun coding stuff
[10:33:21] <sfrisk> okay, well I guess that's it for the day
[10:33:37] <sfrisk> I would say "see you next week", but I shall be on a work trip
[10:35:36] <sfrisk> Talk to all of you later!
