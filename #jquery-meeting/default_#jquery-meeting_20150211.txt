[09:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers
[09:00:46] <rxaviers> Hello
[09:00:47] <jzaefferer> this late already?
[09:00:51] <jzaefferer> but classes still isn't done :/
[09:01:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i thought we were going to make it
[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> We had quite the influx of tickets this week.
[09:02:04] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[09:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> +6 from last week, first increase in several weeks
[09:02:12] <jzaefferer> and some of them weren't even spam
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> Wel, if we include spam, we're up like +106
[09:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> So, arschmitz, jzaefferer: Anything that needs to be discussed for classes?
[09:03:42] <jzaefferer> I don't think so. Just working through some remaining details
[09:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> ...and there's another spam ticket
[09:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> I even put Juvederm on the list.
[09:04:11] <arschmitz> yeah i think we are about done
[09:04:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you aren't gonna miss this demo, are you? https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/18d1d9199c7419ef2609fb6b33357f94e7453184
[09:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Anything for button?
[09:04:54] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I only got to tests/unit/accordion/accordion_options.js in my current review
[09:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> Not at all :-)
[09:05:08] <arschmitz> not to discuss i pushed an update to the PR
[09:05:25] <arschmitz> so thats waiting another review once classes is finished
[09:05:38] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thats only one i found too
[09:05:45] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: like i said just missed one :-)
[09:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so on to datepicker
[09:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11060
[09:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> We need to add a change event to the new datepicker.
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> That should only exist for datepicker, not for calendar.
[09:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> Does that sound right to everyone?
[09:07:58] <jzaefferer> Makes sense
[09:08:12] <arschmitz> yes
[09:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll update the wiki
[09:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> Anything to discuss about CSS dependencies?
[09:09:51] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:10:24] <rxaviers> The DB PR is still work in progress. But, it's pretty much done.
[09:10:53] <rxaviers> An important change is
[09:11:10] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/256#issuecomment-73812904
[09:11:45] <rxaviers> I would like the team's feedback on that (now or later on the PR).
[09:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like we shouldn't have theme as a dependency for any JS component.
[09:12:35] <rxaviers> (Alex has already done so)
[09:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> And the theme selector should add that dependency.
[09:13:08] <jzaefferer> there's quite some discussion
[09:13:14] <jzaefferer> I haven't gotten yet to reviewing that
[09:13:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: to be fair most of it was a bit of a misunderstanding
[09:14:11] <jzaefferer> so we don't need the checkbox anymore, since the user can just pick the files to use, and we provide them separated enough?
[09:14:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it was a dropdown option for theme
[09:14:30] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, if you dont have theme as a dependency on a JS component, you may end up including a theme unnecessarily
[09:14:50] <rxaviers> for example, if you download effects only.
[09:15:10] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and its not needed because the package include the needed files separated out as you would want them by default now
[09:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> If you choose effects only and you choose to download a theme, then getting the theme is correct.
[09:15:22] <rxaviers> ?
[09:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> Explain the scenario where you think a user would unnecessarily get a theme.
[09:16:21] <rxaviers> As far as I was told, no effects need theme.css
[09:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> But separately from the JS modules, you choose a theme.
[09:16:52] <arschmitz> rxaviers: but what scott_gonzalez is saying is even if you pick effects only if you pick a theme you should get a theme
[09:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> If you choose effects only AND you choose a theme, you should get a theme.
[09:17:25] <rxaviers> Why? If no effect is going to use that theme?
[09:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't matter.
[09:17:32] <arschmitz> i do agree with scott here i think to
[09:17:46] <arschmitz> rxaviers: you might be just downloading some componenets to add to something you already have
[09:17:54] <arschmitz> or you may like the theme and use it on its own
[09:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> You've chosen a theme (even if that choice is just not changing the default)
[09:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> Theme is just another module.
[09:18:05] <rxaviers> Why do we care specifying // css.theme on JS files?
[09:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing special about it.
[09:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's wrong.
[09:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> They do not require a theme.
[09:18:26] <arschmitz> rxaviers: its not a true dependency
[09:18:31] <arschmitz> the widgets work just fine with out it
[09:18:35] <arschmitz> they just dont look as pretty
[09:20:48] <jzaefferer> so this is actually plenty wrong? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1440#issuecomment-72333462
[09:21:06] <jzaefferer> we've all reviewed that
[09:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but we've historically lied about the dependency.
[09:21:16] <rxaviers> yeap, I'm completely lost
[09:21:17] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yup more or less
[09:21:29] <arschmitz> i guess its just like dialog
[09:21:40] <arschmitz> claims it depends on resizable and draggable but does not
[09:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've wanted DB to handle optional dependencies for a long time, but it just hasn't been a big issue so far.
[09:22:16] <arschmitz> we keep coming back to the idea of optional dependencies
[09:22:34] <jzaefferer> let's figure out theme.css first
[09:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think anything should claim theme.css as a dependency.
[09:23:11] <arschmitz> i agree with scott_gonzalez
[09:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> The theme dropdown should declare that dependency.
[09:23:27] <arschmitz> thats why in mobile we seperate theme and structure dependencies
[09:23:58] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: what are you referring to here with "in mobile"?
[09:24:00] <rxaviers> "thats why in mobile we seperate theme and structure dependencies" and in UI
[09:24:06] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L5
[09:24:23] <jzaefferer> but that's what rxaviers added for UI
[09:24:41] <arschmitz> i thought it was simplified to a signle field
[09:24:45] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1440/files#diff-d6bd7a3820567725dce833752dff755cR17
[09:24:57] <arschmitz> ok sorry
[09:25:00] <arschmitz> old conversation
[09:25:40] <arschmitz> at one point we talked about simplifiing to a single field
[09:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, so we should probably just drop css.theme.
[09:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> And rename css.structure to css
[09:26:02] <jzaefferer> I think its useful to know if a component looks much better with a theme or not
[09:26:37] <rxaviers> Me too. Are all components usable without a theme?
[09:26:39] <jzaefferer> the theme select can still be flexible, but when you pick something that soft-depends on theme, there should be a hint for that
[09:26:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i kinda agree its good to know if that component has the optional dependency or not
[09:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: yes
[09:26:50] <jzaefferer> "You picked at least one component that needs a theme"
[09:26:51] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yes they are
[09:27:09] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: not needs but looks better with...
[09:27:14] <jzaefferer> sure
[09:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine keeping it, but I don't think we should do anything with it right now.
[09:27:47] <arschmitz> maybe a confirmation dialog if you select a theme component but select no theme
[09:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> And that should not be treated as an actual dependency in the builder.
[09:28:32] <jzaefferer> I wouldn't use a dialog; just a line of text, close to the theme select, that has the hint
[09:28:48] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[09:28:53] <arschmitz> just something to let the user know
[09:29:02] <jzaefferer> "And that should not be treated as an actual dependency in the builder." <- I think that's the important part. rxaviers can you work with that?
[09:29:18] <rxaviers> One is unable to change months on Datepicker without a theme
[09:29:20] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/c95e8ad5f7dfbd4ee188
[09:29:29] <rxaviers> Open up index.htm
[09:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> You can change months.
[09:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> You just don't see the icons.
[09:30:43] <arschmitz> icons are part of theme
[09:30:47] <arschmitz> so you should not see them
[09:32:23] <rxaviers> Re: ""And that should not be treated as an actual dependency in the builder." <- I think that's the important part. rxaviers can you work with that?"
[09:33:19] <rxaviers> I think it's pretty going to be dropping code... Thinking...
[09:34:11] <jzaefferer> pretty going?
[09:34:20] <rxaviers> pretty much*
[09:35:25] <rxaviers> Although, we'll roll back to having hard coded logic into DB like: baseTheme = themes/base/theme.css
[09:35:43] <rxaviers> arschmitz,  What's the analogou theme.css for mobile?
[09:35:48] <rxaviers> analogous*
[09:36:01] <rxaviers> where's it located? is it a single file?
[09:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to hard code anything like that.
[09:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, I guess you do if you select no components.
[09:36:24] <arschmitz> yes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css
[09:36:33] <arschmitz> well mostly
[09:36:44] <arschmitz> there is some complex stuff that happens with icons
[09:36:51] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/css/themes/default
[09:37:06] <rxaviers> How is that complex stuff handled today?
[09:37:23] <arschmitz> well its not that complex :-p
[09:37:32] <arschmitz> its just concats of different combinations of those files
[09:37:52] <rxaviers> Does that happen via css.theme comments?
[09:38:32] <arschmitz> no
[09:38:35] <arschmitz> its hard coded
[09:38:43] <arschmitz> its not specific to the file
[09:38:48] <arschmitz> its specific to support
[09:38:53] <rxaviers> Ok
[09:39:05] <arschmitz> so there is a css file of svg only
[09:39:08] <arschmitz> one png only
[09:39:09] <arschmitz> one both
[09:39:12] <arschmitz> etc
[09:40:34] <rxaviers> If we're not using css.structure vs. css.theme, we can simplify that to `css` only. Right?
[09:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> See jzaefferer's comment above about being able to provide a notice.
[09:42:11] <rxaviers> a confirmation dialog if you select a theme component but select no theme?
[09:42:20] <rxaviers> but, instead of a dialog a paragraph?
[09:42:37] <scott_gonzalez> Right now I'd like to do nothing with it.
[09:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> But we can discuss that later.
[09:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> Not providing a notice isn't a change in behavior.
[09:43:08] <arschmitz> right
[09:43:59] <jzaefferer> Add another DB ticket for that, and ignore it forever like most of the others \o/
[09:45:04] <rxaviers> /o\
[09:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> Are we in agreement on the solution?
[09:47:22] <rxaviers> I respect the decision.
[09:47:53] <rxaviers> But, I was hoping for a generic solution like we had agreed on before.
[09:47:53] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: if you still have concerns, can you put them in the PR and we'll review there?
[09:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: That's still possible eventually.
[09:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> Once the projects are providing build info, this is easily solvable.
[09:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> But we can't let that hold up this portion of work.
[09:48:57] <rxaviers> build info?
[09:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> You've already started a discussion about having the projects define how to build the packaages.
[09:50:09] <rxaviers> oh that, ok. yeap.
[09:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to 1.11.3
[09:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> Everything is cherry-picked to 1-11-stable and I did a test run this morning that looked good.
[09:51:56] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll be doing the actual release either today or tomorrow.
[09:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything they want to squeeze in to this release?
[09:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll take the silence as a no :-)
[09:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> A ticket came in this morning that I don't think we should do anything about.
[09:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11086
[09:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Since you've spent a lot of time on the draggable rewrite, I'd like your opinion on this as well.
[09:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> It just seems like bad UX to me.
[09:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> There's a margin on the draggable, which means that dragging it into the sortables makes the actual sortable elements move.
[09:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, adding the equivalent margin to the sortable shows that that's not the only problem.
[09:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> The element does move around. It's not just the white gap. I think the ticket description is bad.
[09:57:07] <jzaefferer> One day spam tickets end up looking like actual tickets, including jsfiddles :p
[09:57:16] <jzaefferer> days later... "wait a minute, this is spam!"
[09:58:22] <jzaefferer> My tooltip doesn't work!!1 <a class="tooltip" href="http://muscletickets.org">text</a>
[09:59:11] <jzaefferer> Obviously I have nothing to add to the discussion about #11086 :/
[09:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it now seems like a legit bug to me. The ticket was just misleading.
[10:00:20] <jzaefferer> well, nothing to discuss then?
[10:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> The fiddle is pretty bad for showing the actual problem, especially since the reporter explicitly calls out the white space.
[10:00:23] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[10:01:10] <agcolom> hello, are you almost finished?
[10:01:37] <jzaefferer> yeah, let's get out of here
[10:01:48] <arthurvr> Thanks guys!
[10:02:25] <arthurvr> agcolom: kswedberg: arschmitz: danheberden: AurelioDeRosa: RWhitbeck: gnarf: sfrisk:  meeting time!
[10:02:33] <agcolom> hello!
[10:02:46] <arschmitz> hi
[10:02:47] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone!
[10:02:47] <agcolom> agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:02:47] <sfrisk> allo!
[10:03:21] <arthurvr> Hi everybody
[10:03:55] <agcolom> ok, so let's get started...
[10:04:19] <agcolom> Learn site, Analysis of the articles, and develop a matrix of articles/library version:
[10:04:26] <agcolom> action ongoing...
[10:04:46] <agcolom> I sent an email yesterday to devs team to get some help/input from them also
[10:05:45] <agcolom> We have some articles that are based on external sources, so I will speak with the legal team to see what document we need to get consent from the original authors
[10:06:17] <arthurvr> Okay. Maybe we should have clear guidelines about this for the future.
[10:06:57] <arthurvr> This is something that should have happened when importing the articles, not years after we imported them.
[10:06:59] <AurelioDeRosa> What kind of articles are we talking about? I mean on specific topics or...?
[10:07:20] <agcolom> Yes, I'll know more when I speak to them. I guess nothing should be added from someone else unless we have clear consent (To be defined when I speak to legal team)
[10:07:34] <kswedberg> hi all. sorry I'm late to the party.
[10:07:39] <agcolom> They are identified in the spreadsheet
[10:07:42] <agcolom> Hi Karl!
[10:07:50] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6xhKoSBtoK9Nsc7uqBcVQULqflc7xWZbtsTO7p1fqA/edit#gid=0
[10:07:50] <arthurvr> Hey Karl
[10:07:55] <agcolom> it's not many
[10:08:12] <AurelioDeRosa> Ok, thank you
[10:08:15] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi Karl
[10:08:49] <agcolom> Still regarding the review of articles, we now have an issue on GH:
[10:08:58] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/626
[10:09:19] <agcolom> and the doc is public for comments as requested at last meeting
[10:09:29] <AurelioDeRosa> cool
[10:10:12] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I just wanted to check with you whether you have anything to report on automating the CLA checks
[10:10:37] <arthurvr> From what I’ve seen it works *really* nice!
[10:10:51] <agcolom> so it's in place?
[10:11:08] <arthurvr> example: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/648
[10:11:20] <AurelioDeRosa> As far as I've seen, it's in place and working good
[10:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> It's in place on select repos.
[10:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> It has some bugs that I'm still working out.
[10:11:46] <arthurvr> and people can see pages like this giving them info about what’s going on: http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/status/?repo=api.jquery.com&sha=ce333033d1b2a01c86fb4bfcd4531fab4963facc
[10:11:51] <agcolom> Wow, brilliant news!
[10:12:10] <agcolom> ok, so let me update the notes
[10:12:32] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do we have a list of repos then for this?
[10:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> I would guess: api.jquery.com	jquery	jquery-license	jquery-mobile  jquery-ui  learn.jquery.com
[10:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> Based on the output on the server.
[10:14:18] <agcolom> can it be added to all the api. repos?
[10:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> no
[10:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> When it's ready, it will be added.
[10:14:39] <agcolom> ok, great
[10:14:43] <arthurvr> in jquery/jquery it works too I believe
[10:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, everywhere that it runs, it works, except for when it fails.
[10:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> Hence it not being enabled everywhere.
[10:15:37] <agcolom> sure, no pb. It's a great start
[10:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> For example: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2033
[10:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's a broken check.
[10:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice that it says 1 errored check.
[10:16:37] <agcolom> oh, yes.
[10:17:00] <agcolom> Perfect! Thanks for the update! (and the work! )
[10:17:22] <agcolom> next item: Aurelio to see how we can get more help from the community
[10:18:05] <agcolom> some comments received. I need we need a bit more time to polish the document so I'd say action still ongoing.
[10:18:05] <AurelioDeRosa> I think, but I might be wrong, that after the last meetup no other reviews have been made on the doc
[10:18:36] <agcolom> I think that's correct.
[10:19:02] <agcolom> btw, everyone can change settings to receive all notifications
[10:19:04] <AurelioDeRosa> OK, so do we want to wait a bit more or edit the doc based on the comments we have?
[10:19:22] <agcolom> Comments -> Notifications -> all
[10:19:58] <arthurvr> from the meeting notes previous time:
[10:20:01] <agcolom> we need to solve the remaining issues highlighted
[10:20:02] <arthurvr> ”Idea from Ralph: use that as a script to an awesome commercial size video and then blog, tweet, smoke signal it out (Ralph may be able to help)”
[10:21:23] <agcolom> Aurelio, do you want to try to give it another go and solve teh remaining issues?
[10:21:45] <agcolom> (e.g. for the past decade the jQuery Foundation)
[10:21:46] <AurelioDeRosa> Sure! I was waiting for other comments to come in.
[10:22:01] <arthurvr> Okay. Thanks Aurelio!
[10:22:07] <AurelioDeRosa> I'll review it after the meeting and ping you when I'm done.
[10:22:16] <agcolom> perfect! Thank you
[10:22:49] <agcolom> next point: Dan to investigate whether BV could donate rating services
[10:23:06] <arthurvr> danheberden: are you here?
[10:23:20] <agcolom> I think danheberden is not here to let us know whether there have been any updates on this...
[10:23:30] <agcolom> so I'll leave it as ongoing
[10:23:37] <agcolom> Repos at healthy cadence:
[10:23:42] <AurelioDeRosa> yes, I agree
[10:23:49] <agcolom> We continue to make good progress. Big thanks to everyone!
[10:24:01] <AurelioDeRosa> Yep, the work is going well.
[10:24:30] <kswedberg> yeah, big thanks to AurelioDeRosa  and arthurvr for all the work on api.jquery.com
[10:24:32] <agcolom> I've been crazy busy with work so I've not been able to help as much...
[10:24:48] <AurelioDeRosa> We closed a few issues this week too. I think the count isn't as good as it might have been because people opened several new issues
[10:24:50] <agcolom> YEs, Thank you so much for keeping at it!
[10:24:58] <AurelioDeRosa> thank you :)
[10:25:14] <agcolom> yes, we count how many issues and PRs are open
[10:25:24] <agcolom> (until we have a better system in place)
[10:25:47] <agcolom> My schedule is pretty crazy until mid March...
[10:25:57] <arthurvr> I’ll focus on the API site next weeks too. Many easy tickets in there
[10:26:04] <agcolom> hopefully I'll be back in full spead from April
[10:26:30] <agcolom> yes, it's killing me to see some easy ones and not have the time to deal with them!
[10:26:49] <arthurvr> btw, the thing with https references must be in the agenda too.
[10:26:51] <AurelioDeRosa> Don't worry agcolom. arthurvr, the others, and I will take care of the repos :)
[10:27:06] <agcolom> oh yes, I forgot to add that to the agenda
[10:27:08] <AurelioDeRosa> Oh...yes. We decided to discuss it at this meeting
[10:27:20] <arthurvr> No big deal tho
[10:27:26] <AurelioDeRosa> So, what's your idea?
[10:27:38] <arthurvr> we have PRs for all of them in 3 repos I believe.
[10:27:49] <arthurvr> If we all agree with https everywhere I can take care of those
[10:28:06] <AurelioDeRosa> OK, so do we all agree that we should update to HTTPS where available?
[10:28:27] <arthurvr> agcolom: not specific to API sites.
[10:28:30] <agcolom> ok
[10:28:39] <arthurvr> same thing in learn.jquery.com and others
[10:29:10] <arthurvr> but we have https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/86, which is IMHO a seperated discussion
[10:30:20] <arthurvr> The learn/api site demos are meant as quick examples so having it working with file:/// makes sense there. That’s not true for the CDN
[10:31:49] <agcolom> Aurelio, do you have edit access to the notes?
[10:32:18] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, I have.
[10:32:30] <agcolom> Yes, demos should be easy to copy/paste
[10:32:31] <AurelioDeRosa> I didn't want to replace you :)
[10:32:34] <agcolom> and work
[10:32:42] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: feel free to
[10:33:17] <AurelioDeRosa> agcolm: OK, will do
[10:34:19] <AurelioDeRosa> done
[10:34:23] <agcolom> Thanks!
[10:34:33] <arthurvr> I can land those PRs then, everybody okay with that?
[10:34:47] <agcolom> I'm ok with that
[10:34:57] <agcolom> kswedberg: ^
[10:34:58] <AurelioDeRosa> About the API repos, we also wanted to update to the last jquery
[10:35:13] <AurelioDeRosa> we have version 1.10.2 in place which seems a bit odd
[10:35:20] <arthurvr> Yes. But I feel like that should be a different commit.
[10:35:43] <agcolom> I'd link the project leads to give us their view for that
[10:35:58] <agcolom> because api docs are version specific
[10:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> Not for core.
[10:36:05] <kswedberg> agcolom: the only concern I have with getting demos to with with file:/// is that the ajax ones won't, regardless of what we do
[10:36:06] <agcolom> (ui and mobile)
[10:36:20] <AurelioDeRosa> For me different or same PR is the same, so feel free to do what you think it's best
[10:36:51] <kswedberg> agcolom: we've always updated jQuery version in docs along with core
[10:37:14] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa: I opt to keep the commit log clean and focussed. Also keep in mind when we update versions that maybe examples themselfs must change too.
[10:37:17] <agcolom> kswedberg: ok. In that case, would it make sense to add a warning to say these will not work with file://
[10:37:21] <agcolom> file:///
[10:37:41] <AurelioDeRosa> arthurvr: OK, cool.
[10:38:03] <arthurvr> A warning is IMHO something we should have anyhow.
[10:38:04] <kswedberg> agcolom: maybe so, as a comment in the example? would have to look at the examples again.
[10:38:52] <agcolom> yes, a note in the example would be good. We should be consistent also with this so we may want to discuss how to present this
[10:39:09] <AurelioDeRosa> Agree on a note for file:// protocol
[10:39:31] <arschmitz> agcolom: for jquery version in api for ui and mobile i would think it should be whatever the latest version the version supported is
[10:39:47] <arschmitz> agcolom: so for on old ui api version it could be an older version
[10:39:53] <arschmitz> same with mobile
[10:40:30] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, I was thinking of whether you want to update the jquery version for the current master in api docs for mobile
[10:40:42] <arschmitz> that would be fine
[10:40:54] <arthurvr> I will ask the submitter of those PRs to add a note to the ajax examples, okay?
[10:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> Please do not change UI.
[10:41:25] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sure
[10:41:41] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: k.
[10:41:49] <agcolom> arschmitz: so currently, for mobile we have 1.4.5 and core 1.10.2
[10:42:09] <arschmitz> oh wait no sorry
[10:42:11] <agcolom> do you want to keep it as is and update core when we move to 1.5?
[10:42:27] <arthurvr> For mobile I would opt to do so
[10:42:50] <arschmitz> 1.4.5 supports 1.11.2
[10:42:57] <arschmitz> so it should be 1.11.2
[10:43:14] <agcolom> ok, so for mobile we should have 1.4.5 with 1.11.2?
[10:43:23] <arschmitz> yes
[10:43:31] <agcolom> perfect, thanks.
[10:43:47] <arschmitz> agcolom: ack sorry bad memory 1.11.1
[10:44:00] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, 1.4.5 with 1.11.1
[10:44:06] <arschmitz> but i cant see an issue with 1.11.2
[10:44:21] <arschmitz> its a pretty minor patch
[10:44:41] <agcolom> arschmitz: do you want to double check everything and let us know tomorrow on in the next few days?
[10:44:46] <arschmitz> so id just stick with 1.11.2 sorry for going back and forth :-p
[10:44:55] <arthurvr> Can one create a seperated issue for mobile? Over there we don’t hava a ticket yet.
[10:45:07] <agcolom> Sure
[10:46:00] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/358
[10:46:36] <AurelioDeRosa> arthurvr: so are you going to open a issue for api.jquery?
[10:46:51] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa: doing
[10:47:08] <AurelioDeRosa> great
[10:47:41] <AurelioDeRosa> I think this would be an easy update
[10:47:58] <arthurvr> I’ll assign it to me.
[10:48:28] <arthurvr> so then I land the PRs for https this evening, k?
[10:48:28] <AurelioDeRosa> OK
[10:48:38] <AurelioDeRosa> +1 for https
[10:49:32] <arthurvr> Btw, in API site I will commit every v3 specific thing to a seperated branch, okay?
[10:49:48] <arthurvr> as discussed in https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/commit/c24d60b33a3a62187addb85731d1eee0bb71e9d6.
[10:50:20] <arthurvr> We can then merge it into master once we release.
[10:50:22] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, we discussed it in the ticket
[10:50:22] <agcolom> +1
[10:51:27] <agcolom> ok, I think we have everything in the notes...
[10:51:29] <gnarf> hey all - sorry I missed most of this, so far everything seems +1 from me too :)
[10:51:40] <arthurvr> Hi gnarf
[10:51:41] <agcolom> thanks Corey :-)
[10:51:58] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi Corey
[10:53:09] <AurelioDeRosa> I think this was the last point, wasn't it?
[10:53:15] <agcolom> yep!
[10:53:22] <agcolom> are we good to close?
[10:53:39] <AurelioDeRosa> I think so.
[10:53:49] <arthurvr> For those interested, the gsoc suggestion moved to a seperated repo: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[10:54:01] <arthurvr> Yup, ready to close
[10:55:43] <agcolom> ok, thanks everyone.

[10:55:59] <arthurvr> Thanks agcolom!
[10:56:15] <agcolom> thanks everyone :-)
[10:56:41] <AurelioDeRosa> thanks agcolom!
[10:56:51] <AurelioDeRosa> See you all next meeting!
