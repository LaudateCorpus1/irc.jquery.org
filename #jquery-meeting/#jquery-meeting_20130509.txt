[08:05:09] <jzaefferer> Time for the testing meeting, let's see who's around. Ping scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin Krinkle|detached
[08:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> here
[08:05:23] <jzaefferer> Ping gnarf
[08:05:30] <DaveMethvin> i'm in another meeting but will keep an eye on here
[08:05:45] <jzaefferer> Looks like neither Timo nor James are around
[08:05:56] <jzaefferer> Or Corey?
[08:09:24] <jzaefferer> I don't have anything to discuss. I'll put that notes together to post as a status update
[08:15:46] <JamesMGreene> Still on?
[08:15:55] <JamesMGreene> Looks like yes since I'm not muted. :)
[08:16:18] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached gnarf scott_gonzalez
[08:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: jzaefferer ended the meeting 7 minutes ago :-P
[08:16:55] <JamesMGreene> damn
[08:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you have something to discuss.
[08:17:19] <JamesMGreene> Guessing not. Looking at the meeting notes now
[08:18:09] <JamesMGreene> Yup, nothing to add for now
[08:19:42] <JamesMGreene> Like jzaefferer said in the notes, Krinkle|detached and I moved all but 1 QUnit plugin (phantomjs, which will Krinkle|detached will take when he gets a chance)... that's all for now
[08:29:49] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: hey there
[08:30:06] <jzaefferer> Do you know anything about the progress on the TestSwarm refactor?
[08:30:14] <jzaefferer> Or Jenkins migration?
[08:30:29] <jzaefferer> Or nodejs support in QUnit?
[09:45:43] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: No. No. No update, sorry. :-\
[09:46:20] <JamesMGreene> I am also curious about the Jenkins migration. cc: Krinkle|detached gnarf
[09:46:40] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: i got the server environment stable afaik
[09:46:47] <gnarf> just need to do the moving
[09:47:00] <JamesMGreene> gnarf: Do it's not the primary right now, correct?
[09:47:05] <JamesMGreene> *So it's
[09:47:08] <gnarf> no
[09:47:40] <JamesMGreene> Has anyone tried running a QUnit build on it manually to see if the PhantomJS issue resolves?
[09:48:03] <JamesMGreene> I expect it will
[09:48:08] <gnarf> not that i'm aware of
[09:48:11] <gnarf> but you should have ssh
[09:50:47] <JamesMGreene> Perhaps but I also don't know how to run a manual build :)
[11:01:21] <agcolom> Good evening/afternoon!
[11:01:38] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:02:37] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:02:44] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:02:47] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker
[11:02:55] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is a go. Give a shout if you're here
[11:03:09] <toddmparker> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r7lQa0pnbbbOkwGMnrhN_kaeCM-jJ_GtNim72YFgXJg/edit?pli=1#
[11:03:11] <gseguin> hi
[11:03:24] <toddmparker> Hi agcolom, uGoMobi, arschmitz, gseguin
[11:03:41] <toddmparker> sorry i've been m.i.a - swamped with client work
[11:04:08] <toddmparker> i'm on vacation next week so you all can carry on without me
[11:04:11] <johnbender> yo!
[11:04:36] <toddmparker> hi johnbender
[11:04:48] <toddmparker> Updated the roadmap: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Roadmap
[11:05:16] <toddmparker> dates for 1.4 were a bit aggressive. make releases to quarters
[11:05:29] <toddmparker> needs more cleanup but it's better
[11:06:16] <toddmparker> I haven't made progress on the website or porting meeting notes to github
[11:06:24] <toddmparker> slacker
[11:06:37] <toddmparker> anyway, who wants to update first?
[11:06:47] <agcolom> I can be super quicl
[11:06:52] <agcolom> quick!
[11:06:58] <toddmparker> shoot
[11:07:09] <agcolom>     New book on the resources page
[11:07:10] <agcolom>     Api docs:
[11:07:10] <agcolom>         updated to 1.3.1
[11:07:10] <agcolom>         Fixed changedPage examples
[11:07:10] <agcolom>         Added loadPage example
[11:07:10] <agcolom>         changed the swipe/swiperight/swileft examples to add constrast/visibility
[11:07:29] <toddmparker> ^ nice, the color blind issue?
[11:07:31] <agcolom> and Corey help fix something for the php examples
[11:07:37] <toddmparker> did you install color oracle?
[11:07:48] <agcolom> yes, I can't believe I used the worst possible colors!
[11:07:59] <agcolom> (just picked the mobiel and the ui colors !)
[11:08:03] <toddmparker> agcolom: I'll need some help getting momentum on the site when I'm back - you game?
[11:08:06] <agcolom> not a good combination!
[11:08:08] <toddmparker> agcolom: cool
[11:08:11] <agcolom> sure
[11:08:25] <toddmparker> I bet. St. Patrick's day. (orange + green)
[11:08:39] <agcolom> ;-) I felt sooooo bad!
[11:09:07] <toddmparker> agcolom: it'll be good to have you keep tabs on all the 1.4 work to make sure we're updating the docs in that branch as we go
[11:09:20] <agcolom> sure.
[11:09:23] <toddmparker> cool
[11:10:24] <agcolom> that's it from me... After your vacation i should have finished my marking so should have more time
[11:10:34] <toddmparker> perfect
[11:10:50] <toddmparker> so where are we with the view. site wonkiness?
[11:10:58] <arschmitz> all fixed
[11:11:01] <gseguin> it's fixed
[11:11:05] <arschmitz> stable since monday afternoon
[11:11:09] <gseguin> thanks to arschmitz and scott_gonzalez!
[11:11:15] <arschmitz> :)
[11:11:24] <toddmparker> w00t!
[11:11:27] <toddmparker> nice work guys
[11:11:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez: thanks guys :)
[11:11:44] <arschmitz> and im going to keep the monitor i have on it so in the future we will know if it has problems within minutes
[11:11:53] <toddmparker> rokk
[11:12:05] <toddmparker> yeah, thanks to everyone for figuring that out
[11:12:12] <toddmparker> so many tweets on that
[11:12:20] <arschmitz> yeah it was bad
[11:12:22] <toddmparker> my answer: wait, then refresh :)
[11:12:28] <arschmitz> yeah 5 minutes
[11:12:36] <arschmitz> lol
[11:12:41] <toddmparker> good that's squared
[11:12:52] <toddmparker> who wants to go next?
[11:13:05] <arschmitz> yup and i have server keys now too so anything on that front i can help with now
[11:13:07] <johnbender> I'll go
[11:13:11] <gseguin> I can make a very quick one
[11:13:11] <johnbender> Mine's quick
[11:13:15] <johnbender> gseguin: go ahead
[11:13:27] <gseguin> Created the grunt task to generate the zip for Google CDN (with MD5 manifest)
[11:13:27] <gseguin> Fixed a download builder issue with master
[11:13:46] <gseguin> that's it, slow week for jQM for me, busy at Jive
[11:14:28] <toddmparker> gseguin: so are we up on the Google CDN now?
[11:14:28] * johnbender raises his hand.
[11:14:33] <gseguin> not yet
[11:14:36] <toddmparker> ok
[11:14:38] * johnbender puts his hand back down
[11:14:39] <gseguin> next release
[11:14:41] <toddmparker> yeeeessss johnbender
[11:14:43] <johnbender> lol
[11:14:46] <johnbender> can I go next?
[11:14:46] <toddmparker> gseguin: gotcha
[11:14:58] <gseguin> go for it Bender
[11:15:08] <johnbender> pageinit is deprecated in the 1-4 branch of the API site
[11:15:34] <johnbender> and `loadPage` is now `load` in the content widget
[11:15:41] <toddmparker> nice
[11:15:47] <johnbender> splitting everything up has been very beneficial
[11:15:48] <johnbender> eg
[11:15:53] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/content-widget/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L298
[11:16:18] <johnbender> we had the logic for grabbing existing pages mixed in with rejecting the load deferred etc
[11:16:28] <johnbender> everything is getting much easier to reason about
[11:16:34] <johnbender> all tests are passing on all commits
[11:16:39] <arschmitz> Very Nice!
[11:16:44] <uGoMobi> indeed
[11:16:45] <toddmparker> tidy
[11:16:46] <johnbender> next up is changePage
[11:16:52] <johnbender> well
[11:17:01] <johnbender> after I finish splitting out the ajax callbacks
[11:17:13] <johnbender> and them moving it its own module
[11:17:23] <johnbender> and then sorting out how to get the external deps
[11:17:28] <johnbender> and that will be it
[11:17:37] <johnbender> changePage is going to take a while too though
[11:17:42] <toddmparker> for a packaging perspective, how easy is it to only use the ajax nav stuff apart from the library.
[11:17:46] <johnbender> but at this point I think pretty much anyone could dive in
[11:17:48] <johnbender> the idea is simple
[11:17:50] <toddmparker> or to only use a few widgets and no nav
[11:17:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: right now?
[11:18:04] <johnbender> I think it's on a per widget basis
[11:18:07] <johnbender> some work some don't
[11:18:15] <toddmparker> be good to build demos of both of those scenarios to educate and also keep tabs on things
[11:18:18] <arschmitz> yup widgets are specific to the widget
[11:18:21] <johnbender> the navigate event and Navigator object work fine by themselves
[11:18:28] <toddmparker> now and where will we be for 1.4
[11:18:39] <johnbender> the content widget should only really depend on the navigate event
[11:18:49] <johnbender> and possibly the "page" widget
[11:18:53] <johnbender> but that remains to be seen
[11:19:08] <johnbender> my primary goal is just to make it easier to change
[11:19:11] <johnbender> once we get there
[11:19:14] <johnbender> we can do whatever we want
[11:19:23] <johnbender> right now we're afraid to monkey with nav because it's a rats nest
[11:19:38] <toddmparker> yeah, this cleanup will help
[11:19:41] <johnbender> and because it's only tested at the integration level
[11:19:56] <johnbender> the unit tests will make it much more obvious when there is a logic change that doesn't fit with expectations
[11:19:58] <arschmitz> johnbender: nav is really getting a lot better after your refactor for 1.3
[11:20:13] <johnbender> arschmitz: even my nav refactor needs refactoring :(
[11:20:17] <johnbender> that was a serious bitch
[11:20:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:20:22] <arschmitz> such is always the way
[11:20:23] <johnbender> but this part has been MUCH easier as a result
[11:20:23] <toddmparker> refactor the refactor
[11:20:31] <toddmparker> good to hear
[11:20:33] <johnbender> I'm not concerned about the events
[11:20:35] <johnbender> just content manip
[11:20:46] <toddmparker> only you have your head around this enough to attempt the job
[11:20:59] <johnbender> I think its approachable now
[11:21:00] <johnbender> though
[11:21:14] <johnbender> changePage is ugly but if you just break out the little logic pieces it starts to make sense
[11:21:27] <johnbender> the act of moving things out into methods requires you to think about each part
[11:21:31] <uGoMobi> when people see the deprecated note for pageinit in 1.4 and ask what they should use instead, what is the answer?
[11:21:32] <johnbender> and know the dependencies
[11:21:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: pagecreate
[11:21:42] <johnbender> it's part of the deprecation ote
[11:21:43] <johnbender> *note
[11:21:50] <uGoMobi> ok, sorry didn't see it yet
[11:21:56] <johnbender> basically we're back to how it used to be :P
[11:22:08] <johnbender> in the old days before pagecreate was how widgets did their enhancement
[11:22:12] <uGoMobi> yeah I remember that note in 1.0
[11:22:19] <toddmparker> right
[11:22:29] <johnbender> since we only bind once now thanks to _|Nix|_ it's fine again
[11:22:37] <uGoMobi> great
[11:22:38] <toddmparker> think we're going to have to do a lot of education/demos in this area
[11:22:38] <johnbender> and we can de-monkey patch
[11:24:05] <toddmparker> great, thanks johnbender
[11:24:09] <johnbender> word
[11:24:16] <toddmparker> :)
[11:24:23] <toddmparker> who's next?
[11:24:37] <arschmitz> ill go
[11:24:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you wanna go?
[11:24:51] <arschmitz> was a busy week!
[11:25:00] <arschmitz> did a lot of work on the touch.js events
[11:25:08] <arschmitz> added teardown methods to all of them
[11:25:23] <toddmparker> that is really great
[11:25:28] <arschmitz> re wrote how swipe triggers to fix delegation issue
[11:25:41] <arschmitz> added option to not fire tap on taphold
[11:25:56] <uGoMobi> that made a lot of people happy
[11:26:00] <arschmitz> fixed a bunch of old issues with tap and swipe
[11:26:32] <arschmitz> made a few updates to core
[11:26:40] <arschmitz> mostly code quality stuff
[11:26:51] <arschmitz> fixed incorrect keycodes and updated them to match ui
[11:27:05] <arschmitz> removed nested listviews
[11:27:13] <uGoMobi> yiha!
[11:27:28] <toddmparker> nice
[11:27:56] <toddmparker> make sure we're keeping this updated - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog
[11:28:17] <arschmitz> working on trying to set up some test pages using hand.js interactions etc to help ui with the direction for normalizing events
[11:28:46] <toddmparker> lots of stuff noted there already - nice
[11:28:48] <arschmitz> if anyone knows anything that should be included that we ran into with vmouse or in generl let me know please
[11:29:02] <toddmparker> "removed nested listviews" - booya
[11:29:10] <uGoMobi> just added that :)
[11:29:20] <arschmitz> one thing right now
[11:29:32] <toddmparker> we could make a simple demo showing how to make your own multi-page doc that is equivalent to a nested listview
[11:29:37] <arschmitz> is that custom select still uses the dependants functions in core
[11:29:54] <arschmitz> so we cant remove those until we fixure out whats going on with nested listviews
[11:30:55] <uGoMobi> with custom selects you mean?
[11:31:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: one of the big issues that Kin dealt with was that the target wasn't always accurate
[11:31:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: the touch and pointer events would fire on different elements sometimes if you were cloase to the border
[11:31:19] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i knew that one already
[11:31:20] <toddmparker> right
[11:31:25] <toddmparker> it's a nasty problem
[11:31:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you gave scott a page for that this morning right
[11:31:30] <johnbender> gdamn heuristics
[11:31:36] <toddmparker> yep
[11:31:55] <uGoMobi> just pointed arschmitz at an issue where that's the case
[11:31:55] <toddmparker> i didn't look at the code (was on my phone) but it sure looked like the bug
[11:31:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes to custom selects
[11:32:04] <toddmparker> appears like a double tap
[11:32:20] <johnbender> fucking web browsers
[11:32:26] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:32:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is that the one you mentioned just before meeting?
[11:32:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[11:32:42] <toddmparker> johnbender/arschmitz - that issue is with event delegation scenarios, right?
[11:32:45] <arschmitz> ok cool i had not had a chance to look at it yet
[11:33:07] <uGoMobi> was talking about this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4826
[11:33:28] <uGoMobi> we use tap event to add active btn class and click event to collapse/expand
[11:33:33] <johnbender> toddmparker: not sure what you mean
[11:33:39] <toddmparker> right, we mind fake it
[11:33:42] <arschmitz> ah yeah uGoMobi thats the cause there
[11:33:42] <toddmparker> kinda
[11:34:38] <toddmparker> johnbender: i answered my own question, was just reading up on older issues
[11:35:05] <toddmparker> this is a nasty problem
[11:35:08] <arschmitz> unfourtanitly from what scott said it does not look like any of the solutions out there right now are even attempting to fix this
[11:35:18] <arschmitz> but he wasent sure
[11:35:23] <arschmitz> so im going to test them and see
[11:35:50] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:36:04] <toddmparker> lots of people just ignore the hard problems
[11:36:17] <arschmitz> hoping maybe hand.js will have something since thats a big msdn project
[11:36:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: are we talking about the element boundry issue or something else
[11:36:35] <toddmparker> bad that we have to tradeoff speed or clicking the thing you meant to click
[11:36:36] <johnbender> :(
[11:36:38] <johnbender> sorry
[11:36:55] <johnbender> fucking web browsers
[11:36:55] <toddmparker> johnbender: yeah, that
[11:36:59] <johnbender> put it on my gravestone
[11:37:27] <arschmitz> so thats my major stuff for the week
[11:37:36] <toddmparker> if you tap and stuff moves based on that interaction, the touch and mouse events register different targets
[11:37:47] <toddmparker> we say that every day
[11:38:01] <johnbender> toddmparker: that's a different issue
[11:38:03] <johnbender> that one is bad
[11:38:05] <toddmparker> arschmitz: nice
[11:38:13] <toddmparker> ah, so what is this bug?
[11:38:41] <johnbender> I'm under the impression that if you touch near the boundry of an element the touch might fire on another element
[11:38:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: that is also true
[11:38:59] <toddmparker> ah. fugging heuristics
[11:38:59] <johnbender> because of they way that the mobile browsers use heuristics to determine the touch target
[11:38:59] <arschmitz> two seperate bugs
[11:39:08] <toddmparker> trying to be a wee bit too smart
[11:39:10] <johnbender> yah I'm well aware of the moving content issue
[11:39:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: well it has to do with the "I touched here but my viewing angle makes it weird" thing
[11:39:31] <johnbender> I can see why they did it
[11:39:34] <johnbender> it just sucks :/
[11:39:39] <arschmitz> different targets on moving content is great for transitions lol
[11:39:45] <johnbender> arschmitz: ah!
[11:39:47] <johnbender> on that front
[11:40:01] <toddmparker> btw - i found that if you were having sloppy taps being registered, even adding 1px of margin makes a huge difference
[11:40:04] <johnbender> you can disable touch events on the moving content while it's transitioning at least
[11:40:21] <johnbender> it's a css thing you can add to the transition
[11:40:25] <johnbender> I forget what it was
[11:40:29] <toddmparker> if you have elements that are 100% adjacent (touching), things get unpredictable
[11:40:34] <johnbender> the facebooks guys pointed that out to me at jsconf
[11:40:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah but its the click the non touch event that tens to have wrong target
[11:40:37] <johnbender> (eu)
[11:40:49] <johnbender> arschmitz: right
[11:40:59] <johnbender> you can still disable it for the duration of the transition
[11:41:02] <johnbender> which has value
[11:41:05] <toddmparker> johnbender: yeah, you can disable touch events via css
[11:41:07] <johnbender> for saftey's sake
[11:41:14] <johnbender> I thought you could also disable click
[11:41:21] <toddmparker> but the issue is the touch event usually hits first, right?
[11:41:22] <johnbender> or at least that's what he made it sound like
[11:41:24] <arschmitz> johnbender: now does that work with somethign thats techniclly already been triggered though?
[11:41:39] <toddmparker> so the click might be the thing to disable
[11:41:41] <johnbender> arschmitz: sounded like it
[11:41:43] <johnbender> I haven't tried it
[11:41:48] <johnbender> toddmparker: it is the thing to disable
[11:41:58] <toddmparker> interesting idea
[11:41:59] <johnbender> this doesn't help much if the transition happens faster than the click delay
[11:42:01] <arschmitz> hmm... have to keep that in mind whenever we revist transitions
[11:42:02] <johnbender> but it's something
[11:42:10] <toddmparker> ya
[11:42:14] <johnbender> our transitions are generally faster
[11:42:18] <toddmparker> browsers are stupid guys
[11:42:24] <johnbender> so it doesn't help but if they get slowed down it would be a nice thing to keep in there
[11:42:27] <johnbender> just making note of it
[11:42:30] <johnbender> again
[11:42:33] <johnbender> this is second hand
[11:42:39] * johnbender disclaims all the things
[11:42:44] <toddmparker> it's a tip worth pursuing
[11:43:25] <toddmparker> thanks arschmitz
[11:43:34] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: how goes Next?
[11:43:42] <uGoMobi> still going strong
[11:43:53] <uGoMobi> all widgets use same button padding and icon position from core.css
[11:43:53] <uGoMobi> changed all px values to em values
[11:43:53] <uGoMobi> option mini now only changes the font-size, class ui-mini can also be added to a container
[11:43:53] <uGoMobi> all field container CSS is centralized in fieldcontain.css
[11:43:53] <uGoMobi> so far minified CSS file size decreased with 15%
[11:43:54] <uGoMobi> working on making icon position classes work on container + theme inheritance
[11:44:32] <toddmparker> that mini change is great
[11:44:33] <uGoMobi> I update https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog every now and then
[11:44:59] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: is the icon positioning stuff looking promising?
[11:45:02] <uGoMobi> and issues I fix in branch "next" have a label in the tracker
[11:45:12] <toddmparker> cool
[11:45:22] <toddmparker> sounds like we're going to have a nice new icon set soon
[11:45:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes icon position is actually only for listview, navbar, controlgroup and collapsible sets
[11:45:59] <uGoMobi> so that's not too difficult
[11:46:03] <toddmparker> right
[11:46:15] <toddmparker> setting that on the parent will be huge, esp on lists
[11:46:26] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:46:29] <toddmparker> same with theme
[11:46:32] <uGoMobi> Q about listview
[11:46:59] <toddmparker> sure
[11:47:02] <uGoMobi> is it ok to remove classes like ui-li-heading, -desc and -thumb from the code?
[11:47:15] <uGoMobi> I can just style those with CSS, don't need a class
[11:47:41] <uGoMobi> and going over all LI's to add those isn't improving perf
[11:47:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think it should be
[11:47:48] <toddmparker> but are you assuming that the ing = thumb
[11:48:02] <toddmparker> could be an icon
[11:48:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: if I am not mistaken we tell people to add ui-li-icon if it's not a thumb
[11:48:31] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i'd definitely prefer to get rid of all decoration
[11:48:34] <uGoMobi> that's what the JS looks for I think
[11:48:41] <toddmparker> so fine
[11:49:06] <uGoMobi> so I can just add a max height/width override for ui-li-icon
[11:49:07] <toddmparker> heading = h2, h3, etc?
[11:49:11] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:49:11] <toddmparker> desc = p
[11:49:15] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:49:20] <toddmparker> makes sense to me
[11:49:31] <uGoMobi> ui-li-aside has to be added to markup already so will be the same
[11:49:49] <toddmparker> yeah, let's do that
[11:49:54] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:50:03] <toddmparker> nice
[11:50:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i like that better anyway easier to customize the listview layout
[11:50:19] <uGoMobi> yes for sure
[11:50:24] <toddmparker> so does that mean that we don't need to do any list view markup changes with JS?
[11:50:25] <uGoMobi> same with mini now
[11:50:44] <uGoMobi> you can just set .ui-mini { font-size: 14px; } and everything adjusts
[11:50:58] <uGoMobi> can even use a MQ to apply it only on very small screens
[11:51:02] <toddmparker> that is so cool
[11:51:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: correct me if im wrong but for linked listviews and split ones there will still need to be some js decoration?
[11:51:32] <uGoMobi> if you set padding for .ui-btn all widgets with button style will be adjusted
[11:51:41] <toddmparker> nice
[11:51:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not for split
[11:51:58] <uGoMobi> I did that with CSS
[11:52:02] <uGoMobi> a + a
[11:52:03] <toddmparker> sweet
[11:52:11] <arschmitz> and to restrict it is easy too just use a class and specificity
[11:52:13] <toddmparker> smart
[11:52:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: very nice
[11:52:23] <toddmparker> getting a lot of mileage out of advanced selectors
[11:52:39] <toddmparker> linked lists should be ok too, right?
[11:53:15] <uGoMobi> I am just thinking we still need the ui-li-has-alt class for something
[11:53:28] <uGoMobi> don't remember what it was
[11:53:29] <toddmparker> split?
[11:53:37] <uGoMobi> yes that's for split
[11:53:51] <uGoMobi> ah... to set margin right on the first anchor
[11:54:00] <uGoMobi> couldn't do that with CSS
[11:54:26] <toddmparker> can the left and right anchors be floated or sitting side-by-side
[11:54:27] <uGoMobi> because you can target an anchor followed by an anchor
[11:54:32] <uGoMobi> only preceded
[11:54:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that's how it is now
[11:54:56] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:55:03] <uGoMobi> anyway, I keep trying to reduce JS decoration
[11:55:07] <toddmparker> cool
[11:55:09] <toddmparker> ui-li-has-count
[11:55:16] <toddmparker> similar deal
[11:55:25] <uGoMobi> and the nice part is that the CSS file size is decreasing at the same time
[11:55:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: very awesoe
[11:56:01] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:56:14] <toddmparker> be ideal if you could add those classes to your UL manually and call it a day. most lists are consistent and if there is an LI w/o a count or split, just had a bit of wasted space on the right
[11:56:37] <uGoMobi> that's the plan
[11:56:40] <toddmparker> nice
[11:56:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker: iv never created a listview that wasent done server side so id be all for that
[11:57:07] <toddmparker> wasn't sure where we landed with that. so you can be lazy and keep existing markup patterns
[11:57:07] <uGoMobi> maybe something like... check if any of the LI's has a data- attr, if not we are done
[11:57:17] <toddmparker> or add a few extra classes and skip all decoration?
[11:57:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think we are going to add a decorateion option ?
[11:57:57] <arschmitz> to prevent the framework from enhancing if you want to do the enhancment your self
[11:58:02] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:58:03] <arschmitz> when decorting on enhance
[11:58:10] <toddmparker> so you could tack that data-attr on your listview
[11:58:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:58:27] <uGoMobi> but I suppose we still need to support data- attr on LIs in 1.4
[11:58:29] <toddmparker> data-decorate="false"
[11:58:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah default would apply them with js
[11:58:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, we should probably not break the old way if we can avoid it
[11:58:54] <arschmitz> data-decorate="false" would skip
[11:59:08] <toddmparker> but for people who are savvier, explain the classes and that option
[11:59:21] <arschmitz> would also apply to like wrappers on buttons etc
[11:59:22] <toddmparker> seems good to me
[11:59:27] <toddmparker> right
[12:00:11] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[12:00:23] <uGoMobi> what is the plan for 1.3.2?
[12:00:49] <toddmparker> oh, one thing
[12:00:50] <uGoMobi> shall we try to release when you are back from vacation toddmparker ?
[12:00:56] <toddmparker> now that nested list views are gone...
[12:00:57] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/listviews-a/
[12:01:04] <toddmparker> see lists at the bottom
[12:01:20] <toddmparker> do we just bail like that for now?
[12:01:28] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5657#issuecomment-17674830
[12:01:47] <uGoMobi> I will look into adding some style
[12:01:56] <toddmparker> that would be cool
[12:02:04] <toddmparker> collapsible esp.
[12:02:08] <uGoMobi> and might be nice if you could add data-collapsible to a LI
[12:02:20] <toddmparker> tho it would probably look odd once you get beyond a level or two
[12:02:24] <toddmparker> yeah, that
[12:02:32] <toddmparker> +1
[12:02:48] <uGoMobi> oh another listview thing
[12:02:58] <uGoMobi> I thought it might be nice to add DL style
[12:03:05] <uGoMobi> it has been discussed before
[12:03:08] <johnbender> toddmparker: I recommend putting the nested list view thing at the top of the 1.4 blerg post when the time comes
[12:03:12] <toddmparker> yeah, there's a ticket
[12:03:19] <toddmparker> for label/data type lists
[12:03:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker: at least the nested lists are still functional if not pretty
[12:03:25] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2230#issuecomment-2159853
[12:03:26] <toddmparker> easy to do and very useful
[12:03:36] <toddmparker> johnbender: yep
[12:04:44] <uGoMobi> now we don't generate any markup it's easy add a basic style for DL's
[12:04:53] <uGoMobi> easy to*
[12:04:57] <toddmparker> right, agreed. just some styles
[12:05:08] <toddmparker> +1
[12:05:12] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:05:50] <toddmparker> cool
[12:05:55] <toddmparker> easy feature
[12:06:23] <toddmparker> so back to the Q of 1.4.2 - if we have a good batch of fixes, we can look at a release the week after I'm back
[12:06:38] <arschmitz> +1 to 1.3.2
[12:06:38] <toddmparker> sorry, 1.3.2
[12:07:03] <toddmparker> for 1.4, I know we have a ton os issues that we should probably push forward
[12:07:40] <toddmparker> but for the big ticket items - nav, widget cleanup, style cleanup…you guys have an idea on % complete there for use to do an alpha?
[12:07:51] <toddmparker> just trying to eyeball 1.4a
[12:08:21] <agcolom> sorry I forgot something... stopping the auto-enhancement of links/buttons in the header and footer bars.. is that for 1.4?
[12:08:35] <arschmitz> depreciated but not removed
[12:08:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we deprecate in 1.4
[12:08:52] <agcolom> ok. Great! thx
[12:09:05] <uGoMobi> 129 tickets for 1.4
[12:09:13] <uGoMobi> couple dev tasks too
[12:09:23] <toddmparker> heh, yeah we need to triage a lot of this forward
[12:09:24] <uGoMobi> 20 fixed in "next" so far
[12:09:36] <toddmparker> that label is helpful
[12:09:56] <uGoMobi> yeah we do need to triage this
[12:10:04] <toddmparker> it's a huge list
[12:10:38] <toddmparker> we should all look thru here and move things around so we're down to ~40
[12:10:49] <toddmparker> assuming you have 20 fixed
[12:10:52] <uGoMobi> agreed
[12:11:17] <toddmparker> so pick the stuff you really want to fix/add and we'll push the rest into 1.4.1 or 1.5
[12:11:26] <uGoMobi> BTW some of those are PRs
[12:11:35] <toddmparker> true. 28 there
[12:11:38] <uGoMobi> like the panel top/bottom and cover transition
[12:11:54] <uGoMobi> I gave those milestone 1.4 as well
[12:11:58] <toddmparker> didn't see the cover transition
[12:12:08] <uGoMobi> that's a PR from Jason
[12:12:18] <toddmparker> ah
[12:12:33] <toddmparker> re need to re-do table refresh too
[12:12:50] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you were looking that the extension/refresh, right?
[12:13:08] <arschmitz> yeah its on my list
[12:13:17] <toddmparker> ok
[12:13:20] <uGoMobi> after "next" I am going to look into transition flickering issues
[12:13:30] <uGoMobi> and the 1px jump
[12:13:37] <toddmparker> nice
[12:13:43] <uGoMobi> that is a lot of 1.4 tickets as well
[12:14:01] <toddmparker> the option to disable that url hiding will be good. curious to test with that off
[12:14:19] <toddmparker> move smaller bugs to 1.4.1 that aren't critical
[12:14:31] <toddmparker> move features, harder re-factors to 1.5
[12:14:33] <uGoMobi> good idea
[12:14:50] <toddmparker> see what's left
[12:15:09] <toddmparker> you guys know what you want to work on so i'd rather you all claim stuff
[12:15:35] <toddmparker> maybe assign an issue to yourself if you want to try and tackle it for 1.4
[12:15:53] <toddmparker> un-assign or move milestone  if you can't hit it
[12:15:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker: a lot of issues will be taken care of as part of widget review
[12:16:02] <toddmparker> right
[12:16:12] <arschmitz> but _|Nix|_ and i talked and we are kinda holding off till uGoMobi is done with next
[12:16:26] <toddmparker> i see
[12:16:26] <arschmitz> so we know what we are looking at markup wise
[12:16:31] <toddmparker> right
[12:16:36] <toddmparker> no pressure uGoMobi
[12:16:40] <arschmitz> :)
[12:16:41] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:17:01] <toddmparker> so let's have you focus just on the Next re-factor stuff for now
[12:17:03] <uGoMobi> I want to try to finish "next" next week
[12:17:08] <toddmparker> so that can get nailed down
[12:17:14] <toddmparker> nice. that would rock
[12:17:21] <uGoMobi> new default theme can be done on master
[12:17:26] <toddmparker> right
[12:17:34] <toddmparker> even the new icon stuff
[12:17:37] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:17:45] <toddmparker> cool
[12:17:46] <uGoMobi> they already use pseudo element
[12:17:49] <toddmparker> alright
[12:17:54] <uGoMobi> just need to change what goes in there
[12:17:59] <toddmparker> exactly
[12:18:06] <toddmparker> so anyone else need to go?
[12:18:16] <toddmparker> i have a meeting in a few (shocker, i know)
[12:18:35] <toddmparker> it's been nice to catch up, feeling out of the loop
[12:18:53] <toddmparker> any Q's from the community?
[12:19:04] <toddmparker> ok...
[12:19:10] <toddmparker> think we can wrap this up
[12:19:11] <uGoMobi> ok later all
[12:19:15] <toddmparker> later!
[12:19:22] <toddmparker> thanks everyone. looking really good
[12:20:24] <agcolom> we need to close the channel before we go :-)
[12:20:43] <agcolom> toddmparker: ^
[12:21:37] <gnarf> done ;)
[12:28:26] <gnarf> bam
