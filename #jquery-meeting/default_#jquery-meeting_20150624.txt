[09:03:08] <arthurvr> hey
[09:03:10] <jzaefferer> hmpf
[09:03:16] <fnagel> hey
[09:03:21] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:39] <jzaefferer> ping rxaviers
[09:03:43] <jzaefferer> anyone else?
[09:03:49] <rxaviers> hello
[09:03:52] * rxaviers on standby
[09:03:54] <arthurvr>  scott_gonzalez ?
[09:04:00] <arschmitz> hes on vacation
[09:04:13] <arthurvr> yep forgot for a minute
[09:04:28] <jzaefferer> so last week trac was broken, so compared to two weeks ago, we have +16 tickets :/
[09:05:01] <jzaefferer> I guess most of that is undeleted spam, though
[09:05:16] <jzaefferer> meh, whatever
[09:05:21] <arthurvr> I donâ€™t even have to seriously work with it and trac even irritates me, honestly :p
[09:05:33] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I guess button is still waiting for another review?
[09:05:39] <arschmitz> yup
[09:05:45] <arschmitz> i did hear from fluid though
[09:05:57] <arschmitz> they said they didnt think it made a difference lol
[09:05:58] <jzaefferer> what did they say?
[09:06:02] <jzaefferer> ha, nice
[09:06:10] <jzaefferer> so we'll stick with what we decided last week?
[09:06:13] <arschmitz> they said that while radios and checkboxes activate
[09:06:21] <arschmitz> others have different behivor
[09:06:33] <arschmitz> so once it becomes a button there is no strictly expected behivor
[09:06:59] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:07:15] <arschmitz> so yes i think we stick with last week
[09:07:24] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks like the position PR needs an update from you
[09:07:37] <arschmitz> yeah ill take care of that
[09:07:46] <jzaefferer> how are demos going?
[09:07:57] <arschmitz> almost done
[09:08:07] <arschmitz> i was trying to finish for today but had a really busy weekend
[09:08:18] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:08:32] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: any estimate on the DB fixes?
[09:09:47] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, oh, nope sorry. I'm trying to process some Globalize stuff
[09:09:54] <rxaviers> How bad is that impacting UI?
[09:10:07] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I finally got logged out of trac and can't login anymore
[09:10:22] <arschmitz> rxaviers: its a blocker for mobile 1.5 also
[09:10:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: its still okay, but I'd like to get that done and out of the way
[09:10:38] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah the password file corrupted again
[09:10:42] <rxaviers> arschmitz, when is 1.5 due to?
[09:10:46] <jzaefferer> blocker of the release, but not the only blocker
[09:10:48] <arschmitz> same as 1.12
[09:10:55] <jzaefferer> but let's not wait for the last minute :-)
[09:10:56] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok
[09:11:15] <arschmitz> rxaviers: mobile 1.5 is planned to be released along with 1.12 because it dependes on it
[09:11:21] <rxaviers> ok
[09:12:05] <arschmitz> it would be nice to have it for the beta
[09:12:19] <jzaefferer> not just nice
[09:12:21] <jzaefferer> required
[09:12:27] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:12:33] <jzaefferer> but we also need to finish button for that...
[09:12:37] <arschmitz> yup
[09:13:00] <jzaefferer> fnagel: I guess you're still blocked by the lack of a rebase?
[09:14:52] <fnagel> yes
[09:17:58] <jzaefferer> fnagel: unfortunately I don't know enough about that to do something; Scott hasn't done the rebase and now is on vacation, so can't ask him what the deal is. Last I tried to rebase datepicker I gave up after half an hour, I don't really want to try that again
[09:18:19] <fnagel> yeah, same problem here
[09:18:24] <fnagel> I already tried twice and gave up
[09:18:37] <fnagel> but its needed to fix / update Globalize
[09:22:14] <jzaefferer> sucks, but I guess we'll have to wait for Scott
[09:22:29] <fnagel> seems so
