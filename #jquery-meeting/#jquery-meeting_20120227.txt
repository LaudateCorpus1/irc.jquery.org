[08:56:21] <DaveMethvin> .
[08:57:00] <rwaldron> howdy DaveMethvin, timmywil gnarf ajpiano danheberden
[08:57:12] <ajpiano> howdy
[08:57:29] <rwaldron> ^5 ajpiano
[08:57:30] <rwaldron> :)
[08:57:33] <ajpiano> :D
[08:57:44] <rwaldron> I just banged out some maintenance junk
[08:57:58] <rwaldron> android 4 is dumb
[08:57:58] <rwaldron> anyway
[08:57:58] <rwaldron> jQuery!
[08:58:04] <rwaldron> I've missed these meetings
[08:58:39] <danheberden> :D
[09:01:19] <DaveMethvin> yay
[09:02:12] <DaveMethvin> ok i have dan, rick, and adam attending atm ... anyone else?
[09:02:58] <danheberden> i removed the ip throttling feature of the spam filter
[09:03:04] <danheberden> until i can, like, find out why it's awful
[09:03:14] <ajpiano> do you know why all the tickets were showing up as 127.0.0.1
[09:03:20] <danheberden> i have no idea
[09:03:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i guess it was getting hung up on that
[09:03:36] <danheberden> trac is so effing messy
[09:03:56] <danheberden> but i'd rather band-aid until trac is on the new box
[09:04:07] <danheberden> assuming it's some server config thing or something, it can be dianosed then
[09:04:16] <DaveMethvin> any idea why there are so many stack traces?
[09:04:38] <danheberden> DaveMethvin one instance of trac is taking about 40% cpu
[09:04:45] <danheberden> why? i'm not sure
[09:04:53] <rwaldron> wow
[09:04:53] <danheberden> but that box is running all the builds
[09:05:01] <danheberden> also the jvm to build ui
[09:05:05] <danheberden> so it's overloaded anyway
[09:05:10] <DaveMethvin> so it's not hung up on sql?
[09:05:20] <DaveMethvin> i thought maybe it was an issue with the tables not being optimized
[09:05:31] <danheberden> that's where it's hitting itself, but unsure
[09:05:41] <DaveMethvin> really with only about 300 tix open it shoudln't be a big problem for any decent db
[09:05:49] <danheberden> exactly
[09:05:59] <danheberden> the hard part is the table structure in general
[09:06:02] <danheberden> is awful for reports
[09:06:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw that
[09:06:14] <DaveMethvin> everything is chars
[09:06:18] <danheberden> i'll see if i can optimize that at all in the meantime
[09:06:52] <rwaldron> dan 'heberdeen' the optimization machine
[09:06:55] <rwaldron> :D
[09:07:29] <DaveMethvin> so , howz everybody feel about putting out a 1.7.2?
[09:07:45] <DaveMethvin> a few new bugs have come in that could be added to the pile
[09:07:52] <danheberden> rwaldron :)
[09:08:00] <DaveMethvin> if we did a rc next week, perhaps a final the week after?
[09:08:16] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin +1
[09:08:26] <DaveMethvin> then we can really focus on 1.8
[09:08:52] <DaveMethvin> did anyone have any thoughts or concerns about the list of deprecated stuff?
[09:09:14] <DaveMethvin> i want to put together a blog post outlining that, to be sent out once 1.7.2 is done
[09:09:39] <DaveMethvin> so how about the next step is i'll create the blog post and you guys can review that
[09:10:18] <DaveMethvin> then for 1.8 we need some deadlines to raise the adrenaline :D
[09:10:46] <DaveMethvin> Does April 9 sound doable for a beta 1.8?
[09:11:15] <ajpiano> that's only ~1 month essentially
[09:11:34] <DaveMethvin> i approve of  your calendar math
[09:11:37] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:11:53] <DaveMethvin> mainly i want to get some schedule thoughts
[09:12:09] <DaveMethvin> if someone thinks their part will take a lot longer we can adjust
[09:12:16] <DaveMethvin> but we need some date to aim for
[09:13:02] <ajpiano> seems as good a date as any
[09:13:07] <DaveMethvin> ok, I'll send around a message on the -bugs list and we can discuss
[09:13:15] <ajpiano> i think that if conf is late june we have plenty of time
[09:13:16] <DaveMethvin> since many of the ppl aren't here atm
[09:13:22] <ajpiano> if we even care
[09:13:31] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice to have a new version at the conf
[09:13:53] <DaveMethvin> imma assume it takes us a month from beta to final at least
[09:14:01] <ajpiano> reasonable
[09:14:12] <DaveMethvin> depends on whether any build stuff like closure happens
[09:14:17] <DaveMethvin> but that's independent in many ways
[09:14:47] <DaveMethvin> any other stuff to discuss?
[09:15:10] <ajpiano> i think we need to figure out if we really want closure to happen or not
[09:15:27] <DaveMethvin> let's talk about hat for a sec
[09:15:30] <DaveMethvin> that
[09:15:35] <DaveMethvin> or hats
[09:15:41] <ajpiano> seems like a nifty hobby project but it's unclear to me whether or not we really actually plan to ship it
[09:16:05] <DaveMethvin> we still don't have a cc that works with jquery
[09:16:08] <ajpiano> has a lot of ramifications for coding style so far as i can tell
[09:16:09] <ajpiano> that too.
[09:16:11] <DaveMethvin> so that can't be a gating factor
[09:16:29] <DaveMethvin> and i wasn't planning on having any user-facing tool ready for 1.8 that used cc
[09:16:52] <DaveMethvin> the makefile might support something for building custom or cc versions though
[09:17:01] <DaveMethvin> depending on how far that gets
[09:17:02] <danheberden> (fun fact: the box is holding sessions from 2010)
[09:17:16] <DaveMethvin> whoa.
[09:17:54] <DaveMethvin> so to me cc is a "if you bitch about it being too big, pull the source and build your own copy" thing
[09:18:19] <gnarf> here
[09:18:24] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[09:18:38] <DaveMethvin> i would bet that 0.001% of devs want to do that
[09:19:27] <DaveMethvin> but removing some of the dependencies that prevent it from being done would be good in any case
[09:19:50] <DaveMethvin> that's what i've always thought about the cc stuff, the things we need to fix are often the same regardless of cc or not
[09:20:05] <ajpiano> agreed, it would nice to cut down on cross module dependencies
[09:20:13] <DaveMethvin> yes, that's the #1 thing
[09:20:22] <DaveMethvin> which is mainly addressed by the deprecation list
[09:20:31] <ajpiano> without having to be forced to change certain coding practises
[09:20:31] <DaveMethvin> data events, ambiguity of .load(), etc
[09:20:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the cc coding practices are realllllllly confusing to someone who knows js
[09:21:01] <DaveMethvin> it's so easy to screw up
[09:21:12] <DaveMethvin> and i bet a lot of plugins just won't work with cc
[09:21:27] <ajpiano> it's really hard to tell what the demand is, quite frankly
[09:21:30] <DaveMethvin> so even if we fix core, most people won't be able to build their own stuff with cc
[09:21:33] <ajpiano> seems like a very vocal minority
[09:21:46] <ajpiano> very vocal, very minority
[09:21:57] <DaveMethvin> yes, very very vocal
[09:22:33] <DaveMethvin> okay, well, that's it for me
[09:23:15] <DaveMethvin> i guess we're done then, if nobody has anythign else?
[09:23:40] <rwaldron> it's so hard for me to be involved in this conversation
[09:24:06] <rwaldron> I'm really not a fan of what I imagine the source will become
[09:24:11] <rwaldron> alot of WET code
[09:24:32] <ajpiano> i think most of us are in the same ballpark about the CC stuff
[09:25:17] <DaveMethvin> i would prefer source comment directives to duplicated code
[09:25:31] <DaveMethvin> but we need to see what the cc guys are going to do
[09:26:01] <ajpiano> it's been several months since we've even had an update
[09:26:24] <ajpiano> and irksome to table potential fixes because of potentially what they might come up with
[09:27:01] <DaveMethvin> we can move ahead regardless, it's another reason to just do what we think needs doing
[09:27:05] <DaveMethvin> and not let cc hold us back
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron, is there any info on grunt?
[09:27:38] <DaveMethvin> like are you working on making us grunt-friendly?
[09:27:51] <DaveMethvin> i just like saying *grunt*
[09:28:48] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that starts this week
[09:29:00] <rwaldron> I have the whole week free
[09:29:06] <DaveMethvin> yay
[09:31:16] <rwaldron> yay indeed
