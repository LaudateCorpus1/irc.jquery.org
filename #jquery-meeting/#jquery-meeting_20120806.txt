[08:59:37] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:00:20] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron gnarf gibson042 ... hi! should be a short meeting today
[09:00:46] <gibson042> ok
[09:01:14] <DaveMethvin> seems like there aren't any critical bugs, we got a few that I think we can safely drop into 1.8 final
[09:01:32] <DaveMethvin> the one gnarf just mentioned, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10394
[09:02:02] <DaveMethvin> this one looks trivial too: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12203
[09:02:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: seems 12203 deserves a fix
[09:03:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:03:16] <DaveMethvin> i can do that this afternoon
[09:03:28] <DaveMethvin> Any others that need to go into 1.8?
[09:03:44] <DaveMethvin> i want to make sure we don't get overeager and introduce bugs
[09:03:52] <DaveMethvin> so the simpler the better
[09:04:13] <gibson042> there are the sizzle issues in http://jsfiddle.net/gXww6/
[09:04:35] <DaveMethvin> those are the ones addressed by your sizzle pulls, right?
[09:04:36] <gibson042> I haven't opened a jQuery ticket, but I think we should at least have a decision on what to do with it
[09:04:50] <DaveMethvin> i think we shoudl wait until 1.8.1
[09:04:53] <gibson042> yeah, but the pull is either going to be big or slow
[09:05:12] <gibson042> and in the meantime, we have "h3:not(:nth-child(2), :nth-child(3))" not working
[09:05:33] <DaveMethvin> you got a better choice than big or slow? :)
[09:05:52] <gibson042> I was hoping someone else would see it
[09:06:40] <gibson042> although "slow" might actually be pretty fast
[09:07:07] <gibson042> timmywil: do you have the tests use to compare Sizzle to other frameworks after the latest rewrite?
[09:09:34] <DaveMethvin> well i think we'll wait on those
[09:09:38] <gibson042> I guess so
[09:10:13] <gibson042> any thoughts on me opening a jQuery ticket so they don't fall through the cracks?
[09:10:49] <DaveMethvin> sure, do that
[09:11:14] <DaveMethvin> ok any other tix?
[09:11:24] <DaveMethvin> i am planning to do the release tomorrow if nothing else comes up
[09:12:01] <gibson042> I think we're in good shape
[09:12:50] <DaveMethvin> ok then ... i think we're good
[09:13:03] * gnarf cheers
[09:14:18] <DaveMethvin> sounds good then, any other issues?
[09:15:27] <DaveMethvin> then we're done!
[09:16:11] <gibson042> wooo!
[09:18:56] <DaveMethvin> see you guys later!
