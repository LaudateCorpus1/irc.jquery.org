[09:02:11] <jzaefferer> too slow
[09:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf kborchers Dave_Stein rxaviers mikesherov
[09:02:22] * rxaviers is here
[09:02:55] <kborchers> here but working. ping if you need me
[09:03:51] <jzaefferer> kborchers: http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=always+need+you
[09:04:05] <jzaefferer> pick one!
[09:04:40] <kborchers> :D
[09:04:51] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: can haz mergatron?
[09:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like mikesherov and gnarf aren't around yet, so we'll skip infrastructure for now.
[09:05:02] <jzaefferer> I guess we could just look at Core meeting minutes for that
[09:05:27] <jzaefferer> has "upstream issues: https://github.com/snapinteractive/mergeatron/issues"
[09:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> #34 and #40 are the important ones
[09:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> What's the status of download builder?
[09:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Multi-version support was merged into master and is being tested on stage, right?
[09:07:37] <rxaviers> right, we have 3 of 5 bugs pointed by jzaefferer fixed
[09:07:47] <rxaviers> the main one is the "long url"?! issue
[09:07:57] <rxaviers> couldnt find what's going wrong on server
[09:08:23] <rxaviers> working on make the urls shorter as a solution for that
[09:08:43] <rxaviers> so far so good, I have it working locally, I think by the end of the day I can put it on stage.
[09:08:49] <rxaviers> The issues here is computation
[09:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:08:54] <rxaviers> are*
[09:09:21] <rxaviers> well, Im using the lightest one: 0 (from a 0-9 scale) compression
[09:09:47] <rxaviers> (it's enough in compression stand point - will post results in a PR later)
[09:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> What's the other issue?
[09:10:02] <rxaviers> most of the time, computation is ok
[09:10:05] <rxaviers> The only issue is when
[09:10:23] <rxaviers> I update all gallery download links
[09:10:33] <rxaviers> it's a bunch of zippings
[09:10:44] <rxaviers> and that freezes the browser
[09:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> Why is the client updating gallery download links?
[09:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't those be static?
[09:11:40] <rxaviers> we merge static things (themes) with dynamic ones (download builder previously chosen stuff)
[09:12:15] <rxaviers> one possible solution is using the server for that
[09:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> You could have something like db=xxx&tr=yyy
[09:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> where xxx and yyy are compressed
[09:13:19] <rxaviers> that's what Im doing ;)
[09:13:29] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: why bother updating links until you actually select them?
[09:13:39] <jzaefferer> just lazy-update those galler download links
[09:13:56] <rxaviers> it wont work if you right click on them opening a new tab
[09:13:57] <jzaefferer> *gallery
[09:14:11] <jzaefferer> update on mousedown ;)
[09:14:45] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you've got everything to deploy to stage, right?
[09:15:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is that ok? I remember once we talked about that issue and came up the best thing was to update href
[09:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> The href should be accurate.
[09:16:27] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, yeap. Will make sure as soon as I do it the first time ;)
[09:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> Splitting db and tr values should make the update blazing fast.
[09:17:09] <rxaviers> the zipping stuff is not that fast
[09:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to do any extra zipping.
[09:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> The tr values would already be zipped in the template and you'll know the zipped db value already.
[09:17:58] <rxaviers> you are right
[09:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you already have logic to handle both URL formats?
[09:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> The existing uncompressed single version URLs and the new format?
[09:20:06] <rxaviers> yeap, it handles both
[09:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so it sounds like you've got a plan to move forward with.
[09:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for download builder?
[09:20:46] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:20:56] <rxaviers> no that's all
[09:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ping
[09:21:08] <rxaviers> as soon as I put it on stage it will be easier to see
[09:21:26] <rxaviers> another thing it does it check if original url is shorter than compressed and always use the smaller one
[09:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> Guess rworth isn't around.
[09:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog is good to go for the beat.
[09:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> s/beat/beta/
[09:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> The only big remaining task for the final release is verifying the test suite is complete.
[09:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> Progressbar is also ready.
[09:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good just to get another round of accessibility review now that we have indeterminate support.
[09:24:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: wanna look at the dialog testsuite with me tomorrow or Friday?
[09:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:25:06] <jzaefferer> I've got some stuff tomorrow, but open all day for Friday
[09:25:27] <jzaefferer> I can do some testing with progressbar
[09:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> I really need to setup VMs on my (not so new anymore) laptop.
[09:26:04] <jzaefferer> its read only, so should be easy enough
[09:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:26:13] <jzaefferer> kborchers: did you check with any screenreader?
[09:26:57] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i have not, haven't had much work time this week with a sick kid
[09:28:26] <jzaefferer> okay, just checking
[09:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Any update for selectmenu?
[09:31:22] <jzaefferer> I did a bunch of updates for a11y over the weekend
[09:31:39] <jzaefferer> IE and Safari are way better now, but announcing the intial value is still broken
[09:31:51] <jzaefferer> pinged Hans today, hoping for some help there, as I'm out of ideas
[09:32:03] <jzaefferer> once that works, I can make another pass on the open menu, improve that some more
[09:32:14] <jzaefferer> but the closed menu should be much more important when using a screenreader
[09:32:37] <jzaefferer> Felix is making a few updates as well, commented on the main PR in the last hours
[09:32:44] <jzaefferer> fixing some code smells
[09:32:58] <jzaefferer> needs help with the ui-front stuff, since we don't have a reference implementation
[09:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll get autocomplete updated to use it.
[09:35:17] <jzaefferer> okay, when you've done that, can you let Felix know about it?
[09:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:37:34] <jzaefferer> aaand I have to go
[09:37:40] <jzaefferer> will try to connect on mobile
[09:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> Our ticket count is stabilizing.
[09:38:23] <scott_gonzalez> 374 open tickets (1 pending).
[09:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> 13 PRs.
[09:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> Our numbers are exactly the same as last week, which is good and bad, considering new PRs and tickets have come in.
[09:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> As long as the number isn't going up, we're good :-)
[09:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like Krinkle|detached is around to talk about TestSwarm/BrowserStack.
[09:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> But tests are taking way too long to run.
[09:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> And the clients are continually getting errors trying to connect to the server.
[09:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein is working on the draggable implementation.
[09:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov and I are reviewing all his work.
[09:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> Still aiming for a beta this week.
[09:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> Probably tomorrow.
[09:43:02] <jzaefferer> Sounds good
[09:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> I updated the roadmap, I'm open to changes: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[09:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to make it so 1.11 can go quickly.
[09:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine bumping stuff during the 1.11 release cycle if needed.
[09:44:17] <jzaefferer> If we want to keep Mask on the roadmap, we need to solve the screenreader issue
[09:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I never wanted it on the roadmap in the first place :-P
[09:46:01] <jzaefferer> Riiight
[09:46:32] <jzaefferer> I'll review the menubar update soon
[09:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[09:49:27] <jzaefferer> Nope, not from me
[09:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[11:00:01] <gnarf> infra meet - lets be quick, the agenda is super short :)
[11:00:10] <gnarf> jzaefferer ryanneufeld clarkbox Krinkle
[11:00:19] <ryanneufeld> ping
[11:00:23] <Krinkle> pong
[11:00:49] <clarkbox> yo
[11:01:20] <gnarf> Frist up - that jq01 issue
[11:01:35] <Krinkle> (elaborate?)
[11:01:35] <gnarf> I found nothing in the logs, no strangeness on the graphs, etc
[11:01:41] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: same here
[11:01:44] <gnarf> jq01 froze up monday night
[11:01:49] <Krinkle> ah, that one.
[11:01:56] <gnarf> it just went crazy, dan had to request a reboot from (mt)
[11:03:03] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: can we configure email notifications of high load?
[11:03:10] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yeah, zabbix does that
[11:03:19] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: we can setup triggers / alerts / emails in zabbix
[11:03:36] <gnarf> need to get it done
[11:03:40] <ryanneufeld> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/report5.php?sid=e89b7382e3fa574f
[11:04:23] <gnarf> some of those we might need to up the threshold
[11:04:29] <gnarf> but yeah
[11:04:33] <gnarf> lets get that setup soon
[11:04:39] <gnarf> making an issue for myself
[11:05:13] <gnarf> splunk stuff - the infra hosting that machine is still new for us (and for mt) so we are experiencing a slight outage here
[11:05:16] <gnarf> (mt) staff is on it
[11:05:36] <ryanneufeld> splunk is on the new helix system?
[11:05:39] <gnarf> yeah
[11:05:50] <gnarf> right now, the machine is back up, but the data volume doesn't show up... no idea why
[11:06:04] <gnarf> not enough logging for me to even speculate atm either
[11:06:04] <ryanneufeld> should someone else have MT access?
[11:06:18] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: it's on my short list of things to talk with danheberden about
[11:06:30] <clarkbox> because the disk is not there, i can't let it index
[11:06:34] <clarkbox> so there is a gap in logs
[11:09:33] <gnarf> I'm hoping we have that problem solved later today, Arman from mt knows it's important to us
[11:09:38] <ryanneufeld> Well, we can't go back and fill that in
[11:09:48] <clarkbox> some of it we can
[11:09:53] <ryanneufeld> nice
[11:09:57] <clarkbox> depending on the log rotation of the actual files we are indexing
[11:10:15] <gnarf> any other business to bring up atm?
[11:10:18] <clarkbox> but a lot of it is based on a script to get data in… such as server metrics (spy/memory)
[11:10:34] <clarkbox> might want to start thinking about some redundancy….
[11:10:43] <clarkbox> at least for jq01
[11:10:50] <ryanneufeld> That's a good call
[11:10:57] <gnarf> clarkbox: yeah, its on the short list - it was part of the original plan
[11:11:26] <clarkbox> however, this is a rare incident… so not a huge rush/priority
[11:11:29] <gnarf> clarkbox: I think we might want to do it anyway just to handle the load of the higher traffic sites
[11:11:40] <clarkbox> gnarf, when was the last time www/ went down?
[11:11:55] <gnarf> clarkbox: not since we've launched it, this was the first incident I'm aware of
[11:11:59] <gnarf> months
[11:12:05] <clarkbox> ya cool
[11:12:08] <ryanneufeld> the more important thing to me
[11:12:14] <ryanneufeld> is that I found out when I saw the HN post about it
[11:12:34] <ryanneufeld> just as I was going to bed, I looked at my rss reader and spotted it
[11:12:34] <gnarf> yeah, zabbix saw it but no alerts configured
[11:12:40] <ryanneufeld> k
[11:13:12] <ryanneufeld> I've got nothing else to bringup
[11:14:41] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: perhaps part of the task for setting up the notices could be an emergency response plan? I kinda felt like I was fumbling around with no idea who to call/what to do
[11:14:52] <ryanneufeld> the best I could do was try and ssh.
[11:15:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yeah, well, just between us, beyond that comes texting dan/I/someone with (mt) access to look in that backend
[11:15:31] <gnarf> sometimes you can kill whatever rogue process has caused the problem
[11:15:36] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:15:49] <gnarf> other times you need to ask the (mt) support for more help
[11:15:49] <ryanneufeld> I have Dan's number now, and he has mine
[11:16:05] <ryanneufeld> do you have my canadian number?
[11:16:17] <gnarf> yeah, if someone doesn't have my number, get it from me - I think I do
[11:16:44] <ryanneufeld> I've got yours
[11:16:50] <ryanneufeld> but I think I only gave you my US number
[11:16:54] <ryanneufeld> which I only use when I'm in the US
[11:17:10] <gnarf> also, any of the jQuery Board guys have contact info for me too if you can't track it down
[11:17:18] <ryanneufeld> cool
[11:17:30] <ryanneufeld> do you prefer text or call?
[11:19:48] <gnarf> text might get ignored, my phone beeps a lot, so text and/or also call if it's important enough :)
[11:20:13] <gnarf> skype / gchat are decent contact vectors for me as well
[11:20:24] <gnarf> if its a 5 alarm, hit everything :)
[11:20:39] <gnarf> anyway, back in -infrastructure - thanks guys
