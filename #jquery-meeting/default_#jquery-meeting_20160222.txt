[12:01:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhcW9_TlSwD8JnO1_HNnSYJAriTK9WYZ8uQNDvtAAhA/edit
[12:01:33] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[12:01:35] <timmywil> da meetings
[12:01:38] <timmywil> hey
[12:01:38] <DaveMethvin> m_gol is out this week
[12:01:44] <timmywil> oh right
[12:01:54] <timmywil> that's fine
[12:02:14] <timmywil> I'm planning on releasing 1.12.1/2.2.1 today
[12:02:18] <DaveMethvin> oh good on the .1 release yeah!
[12:02:21] <timmywil> I've got a short blog post
[12:02:34] <timmywil> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpbVbv7QZTbX0kp75rPeSW_NIz1EmNZrr_RJtLAFl_8/edit
[12:02:39] <DaveMethvin> i need to finish up the migrate 1.3.1 as well
[12:03:14] <DaveMethvin> blog post lgtm
[12:03:21] <timmywil> cool
[12:03:30] <timmywil> when do you think migrate will be ready?
[12:03:53] <timmywil> or, how much is left?
[12:04:07] <DaveMethvin> i'll have it out by thursday ... i just need to get the publish script to work
[12:04:08] <DaveMethvin> :)
[12:04:16] <timmywil> cool
[12:04:41] <timmywil> yea, the extend issue
[12:04:50] <timmywil> I'm thinking we can close
[12:05:09] <DaveMethvin> me too, i agree the proposed behavior is better but we'll break something
[12:05:09] <timmywil> gibson042: thoughts?
[12:05:11] <gibson042> for "null overwrites array", I agree
[12:05:25] <gibson042> but the ticket also highlighted the array index issue
[12:05:36] <markelog> hey-hey, sorry, i'm late
[12:05:40] <timmywil> np
[12:05:41] <gibson042> do we need a ticket? do we want to fix it?
[12:06:04] <gibson042> we basically fail at arrays
[12:06:30] <DaveMethvin> i feel like those util methods are what they are unless new functionality doesn't intersect
[12:06:36] <gibson042> specifically, we treat them like objects
[12:06:54] <DaveMethvin> i think the odds are that ppl don't run into that often since it's kind of strange
[12:07:02] <DaveMethvin> to do it in the first place
[12:07:10] <gibson042> yes
[12:07:25] <timmywil> I guess the alternative is concat?
[12:07:54] <gibson042> yeah
[12:07:55] <timmywil> or complete replacement
[12:08:21] <timmywil> I wonder what lodash does
[12:08:38] <markelog> +1
[12:08:52] <markelog> yeah, i think we should follow more common pattern?
[12:09:06] <DaveMethvin> sure as long as we don't change any existing behavior. :)
[12:09:08] <timmywil> lodash does the same thing we do
[12:09:23] <gibson042> bizarre
[12:09:37] <gibson042> but that's good enough for me
[12:09:48] <markelog> yeah, just checked that too
[12:09:53] <gibson042> likewise
[12:09:58] <timmywil> cool
[12:10:06] <markelog> it seems if lodash does it, our behaviour should be fine as well
[12:10:21] <markelog> is there some method in es6 too right?
[12:10:35] <markelog> like Object.extend or something?
[12:10:38] <timmywil> I'm not sure there is for deep extend
[12:11:15] <DaveMethvin> i just think we're outside the use case for $.extend which is mainly good for non-intersecting args
[12:11:24] <markelog> yeah, just checked
[12:11:30] <markelog> Object.assign does the same thing
[12:11:38] <timmywil> ok
[12:11:52] <DaveMethvin> we can redefine a new method to do other/better/different things but i think it would be better to just document that it does what it does
[12:12:01] <timmywil> agreed
[12:12:04] <markelog> they probably copied it from lodash though )
[12:12:06] <DaveMethvin> and let ppl define their own if they need different things
[12:12:25] <markelog> which might be copied from underscore
[12:12:31] <markelog> which in turn might be copied from us)
[12:12:37] <DaveMethvin> which might be copied from us :)
[12:12:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:12:43] <markelog> ))
[12:12:45] <gibson042> whatever
[12:12:52] <markelog> i wonder from who we copied it
[12:12:53] <timmywil> so, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2933
[12:13:05] <gibson042> it's totally useless, but everyone behaves the same so it sticks :)
[12:13:15] <DaveMethvin> i don't think a change is needed to that timeout stuff
[12:13:20] <gibson042> strongly agree
[12:13:26] <DaveMethvin> there's an http code for what he needs
[12:13:30] <timmywil> that's where I'm leaning
[12:13:35] <markelog> completely agree here too
[12:13:56] <DaveMethvin> it's just saving one more test for him
[12:14:10] <DaveMethvin> at the expense of making "timeout" ambiguous
[12:14:16] <markelog> that statusText thing is for the client side anywhay
[12:14:48] <markelog> otherwise we might end up adding custom errors for the every http error out there
[12:15:18] <timmywil> anything else?
[12:15:28] <timmywil> markelog: you missed me saying I'm going to release 1.12.1/2.2.1 today
[12:15:30] <DaveMethvin> on the migrate 3.0 issues
[12:15:38] <DaveMethvin> patches welcome there
[12:15:40] <markelog> timmywil: coolsies!
[12:15:56] <markelog> DaveMethvin: is there something pressing in the migrate?
[12:16:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm still not sure of exactly when to warn on some of the show/hide stuff
[12:16:24] <DaveMethvin> writing that part of the blog post and/or docs would help
[12:16:25] <markelog> DaveMethvin: yeah, i remember your concern, i'm not sure who either
[12:16:32] <markelog> *how
[12:16:45] <DaveMethvin> if it's documented what changed it will be clear when to warn and what needs to be shimmed
[12:16:46] <markelog> we can restore previous behaviour
[12:16:57] <DaveMethvin> well i can copy/pasta the whole old code over, sure :)
[12:17:02] <gibson042> lol
[12:17:08] <timmywil> heh
[12:17:09] <gibson042> let me think on that
[12:17:13] <markelog> but i'm not sure what on what we have to warn
[12:17:15] <DaveMethvin> but even then i can't tell someone what changed
[12:17:30] <markelog> we can take those breakage cases i mentioned in the gibson pull
[12:17:38] <markelog> detect and warn on those
[12:17:42] <timmywil> maybe just a warning in the first hide/show call or something
[12:17:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah, first time might be a good strategy
[12:18:01] <markelog> we are not breaking that much though!
[12:18:08] <gibson042> true
[12:18:23] <DaveMethvin> just need a list of the cases where it breaks and the ways to fix it
[12:18:33] <markelog> so basically, and gibson042 correct me if, mistaken here, we always set a display:none for hide
[12:18:38] <timmywil> yea, users might need to make some adjustments, but I think they mostly need a note on what's different.
[12:19:00] <DaveMethvin> other than that the 3.0 migrate changes are relatively easy
[12:19:05] <markelog> and instead of setting display we just remove it if it was `none`
[12:19:22] <gibson042> yeah
[12:19:29] <markelog> and that is hard part to act upon
[12:19:53] <markelog> which should be like that bad for legacy code out there
[12:20:16] <markelog> so we can just restore the behaviour and warn on edge cases i have mentioned
[12:20:46] <gibson042> we can also programatically check for differences, and just warn if we see them
[12:20:55] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[12:20:59] <markelog> like what diff?
[12:21:06] <markelog> oh, i get it
[12:21:19] <markelog> it seems it wouldn't be that effective though
[12:21:25] <markelog> you might end up warning on every use
[12:21:46] <gibson042> it's still worth clamping the output count
[12:21:48] <DaveMethvin> trying to keep the noise down on some of these seems hard, same with .data()
[12:21:55] <gibson042> but we'd know that output is called for
[12:22:06] <markelog> DaveMethvin: yeah, because if we would warn on every case
[12:22:11] <markelog> we would slow down the perf!
[12:22:16] <DaveMethvin> good
[12:22:17] <gibson042> ha!
[12:22:17] <DaveMethvin> :)
[12:22:22] <markelog> which isn't that good in the old code
[12:22:26] <DaveMethvin> that way ppl wouldn't include it everywhere
[12:22:37] <gibson042> bad perf from migrate is A-OK
[12:22:42] <DaveMethvin> and when they complain we'd say, you were only supposed to use it to find the problems and fix them!
[12:22:53] <DaveMethvin> not include it for 5 years
[12:22:58] <timmywil> what about always throwing an error when migrate is included
[12:23:07] <markelog> weeel, that is a gamble it seems )
[12:23:15] <DaveMethvin> wordpress is an offender
[12:23:16] <timmywil> only in 3.0
[12:23:25] <markelog> timmywil: maybe a warning?
[12:23:33] <markelog> error seems severe
[12:23:35] <timmywil> or, like, console.error
[12:23:40] <markelog> yeah
[12:23:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be fine i think
[12:24:12] <markelog> we can try it, but be sure to back it up, if someone complain about it
[12:24:15] <DaveMethvin> some sort of console message in any case
[12:24:19] <timmywil> yea
[12:24:19] <markelog> yeah
[12:24:39] <DaveMethvin> the more we throw in here the slower it will make things
[12:25:03] <DaveMethvin> but that's why we don't advise it in production
[12:25:17] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/149
[12:25:17] <DaveMethvin> so at least we told them, whether they listen to us or not
[12:25:21] <markelog> and do the tweet, mention that in the blog post or something like that i think
[12:25:49] <DaveMethvin> There's a message there already, i can just make it always show
[12:25:52] <DaveMethvin> "migrate is active"
[12:26:09] <timmywil> add something like "Please remove migrate in production"
[12:26:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can change the message
[12:26:57] <timmywil> anything else for today?
[12:27:03] <DaveMethvin> not me
[12:27:20] <markelog> just to mention, that i'm working on that show/hide for detached elems
[12:27:24] <markelog> and for that insight thingy
[12:27:31] <markelog> previous week was crazy
[12:27:35] <timmywil> thanks
[12:27:45] <markelog> can find proper time to do these things
[12:27:56] <markelog> hope this week would turn to be better
[12:28:08] <timmywil> np
[12:28:12] <timmywil> see you in -dev all
