[14:00:54] <sfrisk> arschmitz, kristyjy, geekman-rohit, nashvail
[14:00:56] <nashvail> âœ‹
[14:02:07] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:02:24] <kristyjy> hello
[14:03:12] <sfrisk> first up, have teh changes been made to the note on 'grunt tests' ?
[14:04:28] <kristyjy> I wrote them but didn't check them in. I'm going to do that now lol
[14:04:53] <sfrisk> lol
[14:06:55] <sfrisk> okay, let us know when that's up
[14:07:11] <sfrisk> also on the table front - has anyone seen anything that they think needs to be added in the base pass?
[14:07:25] <sfrisk> or do we want to pull that in, and then create stories for the extra table features we may want
[14:07:29] <sfrisk> (like how it acts responsively)
[14:10:21] <nashvail> Looks good to me for the base pass
[14:11:16] <kristyjy> side note about the documentation ticket I'm going to have to do a rebase I forgot to change my email in some commits so it's not passing the CLA
[14:12:42] <sfrisk> okay
[14:13:14] <sfrisk> I can't remember if we have tickets open for additional table stuff - there might be one for striped tables
[14:13:27] <sfrisk> and also for the respoinsive side scroll table
[14:13:46] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/76
[14:14:01] <geekman-rohit> hey people
[14:14:19] <sfrisk> Bordered tables
[14:14:20] <sfrisk> Striped tables
[14:14:20] <sfrisk> Responsive tables
[14:14:24] <sfrisk> So for base we had the above notes
[14:14:56] <sfrisk> (we're looking at the current table pr, I think it might be good for the initial table pass, and we can add tickets for including additional featueres)
[14:22:06] <nashvail> btw I have added a link to the style guide .sketch file in this issue https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/157 if anyone wants to check that out
[14:22:19] <sfrisk> (on the table front, I just pushed it to a branch in views, so people can view it)
[14:22:56] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/tree/53-tablestyles
[14:23:08] <sfrisk> might take 5-10 minutes for views to show it/compile
[14:25:06] <nashvail> sfrisk we have to decide on the button design too
[14:25:12] <sfrisk> yes
[14:25:21] <sfrisk> I'm going to comment on the issue to get some attention on it
[14:25:35] <nashvail> alright
[14:27:37] <nashvail> How about the Modals btw? Good or should try a different approach?
[14:27:53] <nashvail> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/A0Zjf9Ls/Screen%20Shot%202016-05-24%20at%2011.05.34%20PM.png
[14:28:38] <geekman-rohit> so
[14:28:47] <geekman-rohit> we are supposed to add that class to every tr and td??
[14:28:59] <geekman-rohit> I think thats not so easy to use
[14:29:04] <geekman-rohit> its.. cumbersome
[14:29:31] <geekman-rohit> of the table has our class we should apply our styles to tr and td as well
[14:29:39] <geekman-rohit> and th and thead and tbody if any
[14:31:46] <sfrisk> (sorry, got dragged away)
[14:32:32] <geekman-rohit> if the table has .table class there should be no need to add class to each tr and td
[14:32:47] <sfrisk> it is if you're doing the DIV based approach
[14:32:52] <geekman-rohit> yes
[14:33:04] <geekman-rohit> not if its a table tag
[14:34:01] <sfrisk> I think arschmtiz was here when we had the discussion on this a few meetings ago
[14:34:02] <kristyjy_> I was avoiding doing any default styles on table stuff but I can put it back because I agree it does seem like kind of a pain to have to put all of the classes on the table
[14:35:09] <sfrisk> where we decided to avoid styling base elements and use class base styling instead
[14:35:11] <geekman-rohit> so this is what was the conclusion? no styling to table elements at all without classes?
[14:35:21] <sfrisk> similar to what we have it buttons currently
[14:35:45] <sfrisk> it's there partly to make sure there aren't possible conflicts
[14:36:05] <sfrisk> if someone pulls in some CSS that styles table elements directly, it won't break what we have
[14:36:07] <geekman-rohit> we add our styles
[14:36:13] <geekman-rohit> only if the table tag has our class
[14:36:44] <sfrisk> also when we add additional styles, we're going to need to have extra classes on the table
[14:37:03] <sfrisk> we can add a comment to the table PR, about if we like "all classes, all the time" approach
[14:37:06] <geekman-rohit> so table.table tr{ @extend .table-row}
[14:37:20] <sfrisk> first, don't want to use extend for BM
[14:37:26] <sfrisk> for BE    M
[14:37:33] <geekman-rohit> just an example
[14:37:40] <geekman-rohit> we can use mixin to do that
[14:37:47] <sfrisk> also I thought the goal was to try and avoid cascading
[14:37:49] <kristyjy> still seems like that would be a pain to override IMO
[14:39:37] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/53-tablestyles/demos/tables.html
[14:42:32] <sfrisk> added notes to the PR
[14:44:57] <sfrisk> also do we have full width options?
[14:47:04] <kristyjy> not currently but it's probably a good idea
[14:47:24] <kristyjy> I had it full width by default but changed it due to comments in the PR
[14:47:31] <sfrisk> that's an easy hit - do you want to had a full-width table?
[14:48:07] <kristyjy> table-fullwidth class?
[14:49:36] <sfrisk> or table-full
[14:52:06] <kristyjy> yeah that's better
[14:52:52] <sfrisk> bah, it's almost 3
[14:54:02] <sfrisk> and I have work I need to get done
[14:55:03] <sfrisk> nashvail - the modals look good although slightly concerned with similarity to material
[14:57:24] <sfrisk> discuss more tomorrow/latter, maybe on css-chassis
[14:57:25] <sfrisk> ?
[14:57:30] <sfrisk> #css-chassis
[14:59:06] <sfrisk> okay, see everyone later
