[09:01:28] <DaveMethvin> oh duh, it's meeting time
[09:01:29] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 3 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[09:01:33] <DaveMethvin> `read
[09:01:33] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From m_gol, 1d 16h ago: The blog post has bugs. ;) You
[09:01:39] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From m_gol, 1d 16h ago: The blog post has bugs. ;) In a couple of places there is 1.12 instead of 1.11 and 2.2 instead of 2.1
[09:01:43] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From m_gol, 1d 16h ago: also, the "Note that the main jquery page is currently not up to date" part is incorrect since beta3 wasn't published with a beta tag
[09:01:54] <DaveMethvin> damn that b-ot is slow
[09:01:58] <DaveMethvin> anyone here?
[09:02:21] <gibson042> yup
[09:03:24] <markelog> hey
[09:03:47] <DaveMethvin> hey guys, just fixin the blog post
[09:04:14] <DaveMethvin> ok fixed
[09:05:00] <DaveMethvin> okay
[09:05:21] <DaveMethvin> so i'm not sure if anyone is using the beta
[09:05:31] <DaveMethvin> but we did already get two bug reports about node
[09:05:33] <gibson042> npm users :)
[09:05:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't understand how they're using jquery
[09:06:01] <DaveMethvin> honestly are they just pulling it in to use $.each?
[09:06:22] <DaveMethvin> i guess we'll need some more docs about that
[09:06:24] <gibson042> I'm at a loss, but it sure looks like at least a few of them are
[09:07:04] <gibson042> our utility functions may not be great, but they sure are heavily used
[09:07:28] <DaveMethvin> not by people who want to $.each on a string, you insensitive clod!
[09:07:43] <gibson042> hahaha
[09:07:48] <DaveMethvin> isKindOfArrayLikeIfYouLookAtIt
[09:08:26] <DaveMethvin> so maybe we'll hear back from those users at some point
[09:08:41] <DaveMethvin> that first one must have been someone already using the jquery package on npm and we "upgraded" them
[09:08:48] <DaveMethvin> so who knows how they are using it
[09:08:55] <DaveMethvin> and perhaps even THEY don't know how they're using it
[09:09:12] <gibson042> pub-sub with jQuery events ;)
[09:09:28] <DaveMethvin> because tbh you know how npm just pulls in tons of stuff and most of the time it has nothing to do with the actual packages that are your direct dependencies
[09:09:38] <DaveMethvin> so she may not honestly know
[09:10:18] <DaveMethvin> so does it seem like pr 1457 is ready to land?
[09:10:44] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at it since that last push
[09:11:08] <markelog> i think so, but i would like to check it one last time
[09:12:10] <DaveMethvin> just pulling it in here
[09:12:26] <gibson042> I haven't been following it very closely because I know the testrunner changes will have to be revisited if we do stop trying to be so clever with the Sizzle tests, but the test/unit/* portion is probably good
[09:12:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah mainly i need this to land before trying to change unwrap
[09:13:10] <gibson042> I'm +1 on landing
[09:13:42] <DaveMethvin> ok i can land it right after the meeting and a little bit of final review
[09:13:57] * gibson042 , always happy to offer an uninformed opinion
[09:14:05] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:14:47] <DaveMethvin> so i'm wondering whether to land the unwrap( selector ) feature anyway, since it's a feature
[09:14:56] <DaveMethvin> trivial to implement but i just wondered if it would get lost
[09:15:03] <DaveMethvin> and we don't have any other new stuff afaict
[09:15:08] <DaveMethvin> api-wise
[09:15:13] <DaveMethvin> opinions?
[09:15:58] <markelog> you think that would be useful feature?
[09:16:11] <gibson042> arguably
[09:16:18] <gibson042> I like the increased consistency
[09:16:41] <gibson042> and a .x.0 release is the right time to add it
[09:16:55] <markelog> consistency with what?
[09:17:05] <gibson042> with the other manipulation methods
[09:17:08] <DaveMethvin> it helps to document *what* is being unwrapped and also avoids accidentally unwrapping something that isn't wrapped
[09:17:09] <markelog> we talking about this ticket right â€“ http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13967
[09:17:21] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:18:00] <markelog> like jQuery#remove method?
[09:18:07] <DaveMethvin> to implement it just needs to add an argument and then pass that to .parent()
[09:18:40] <DaveMethvin> but i think i'll reassign to 1.12
[09:18:59] <DaveMethvin> it's easier if we have a larger group of api changes together
[09:19:06] <DaveMethvin> and we'll definitely have some of those in 1.12
[09:19:10] <markelog> right
[09:19:24] <gibson042> works for me
[09:19:56] <gibson042> it's like you said on Trac, the wrappish methods are oddities
[09:20:07] <DaveMethvin> i don't like em at all
[09:20:16] <DaveMethvin> you can do them yourself with fewer special cases
[09:20:53] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 do you think you'll get to 14484 this week?
[09:21:18] <gibson042> I do believe so, but I thought the same at the past two meetings
[09:22:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, well you have Christmas off right? :)
[09:22:09] <DaveMethvin> NOT ANYMORE!
[09:22:35] <gibson042> if someone else is itching to take it they can, but otherwise I think I can squeeze it in between presents and eggnog :D
[09:22:45] <DaveMethvin> i don't think any of these are critical so we can push them if they turn out being complicated or large
[09:23:43] <gibson042> agreed; I doubt we're really holding anyone up
[09:23:51] <DaveMethvin> we may not even need an RC depending on what we change, but i'd like to get these out the first or second week of Jan
[09:23:59] <DaveMethvin> so we can move on to the fun stuff
[09:24:21] <DaveMethvin> i need to find out if jauborg will have time to do the new $.xhr api stuff
[09:24:31] <DaveMethvin> if not we should get someone else to do it
[09:24:52] <markelog> well, right now it would only a shortland method
[09:25:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah but we should have a plan for beyond that
[09:25:12] <markelog> so it's pretty easy task to do
[09:25:28] <DaveMethvin> and we could actually ship the first non-shorthand implementation in 1.12 as a separate module
[09:25:31] <markelog> yeah, that could go in several directions
[09:25:33] <DaveMethvin> like we did selector
[09:26:09] <DaveMethvin> or maybe we don't support the separate module in 1.12, only 2.2
[09:26:22] <DaveMethvin> because some good stuff like CORS isn't going to work there
[09:26:49] <DaveMethvin> but that's why i want to ship 1.11 so we can move on to that
[09:27:10] <DaveMethvin> i wanted opinions on some of the tickets there
[09:27:24] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14530
[09:27:37] <markelog> -1 to that
[09:27:37] <DaveMethvin> i know gibson042 is all "equal rights for text nodes" :)
[09:28:09] <gibson042> I was willing to fight for traversing, but manipulation I care much less about
[09:28:29] <DaveMethvin> oh, you're a racis--er, modulist?
[09:28:42] <gibson042> shhhh
[09:29:06] <gibson042> you never know who's listening
[09:29:22] <DaveMethvin> john resig at one point was advocating that .text() should do the expected thing, which was for example that .text() would set the value on a textarea or input
[09:29:37] <DaveMethvin> but that seems kind of magic
[09:29:38] <gibson042> what a mess
[09:29:42] <gibson042> nonononono
[09:30:03] <DaveMethvin> we've gotten into trouble trying to help people by reinforcing their misconceptions
[09:30:36] <markelog> so everyone didn't like that?
[09:30:59] <markelog> :-)
[09:31:08] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14568 seemed okay to me
[09:31:29] <DaveMethvin> markelog has a patch in that area already to remove the use strict
[09:31:55] <DaveMethvin> oh and speaking of reinforcing misconceptions http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14633
[09:32:06] <markelog> i'm solving issues even before they present themselfs
[09:32:09] <DaveMethvin> good old attr-prop
[09:32:31] <gibson042> ugh
[09:33:18] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10870 "fixed" this
[09:34:17] <DaveMethvin> seems like something to revisit if we're doing breaking changes in 1.12/2.2
[09:35:50] <DaveMethvin> any other stuff you guys wanted to discuss?
[09:35:57] <DaveMethvin> like what you want for christmas?
[09:36:37] <gibson042> I'd settle for a comprehensible explanation of dirtiness/reset at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-button-element.html#ask-for-a-reset
[09:37:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah i agree it's not totally clear
[09:37:33] <DaveMethvin> of course they were trying to back into a spec from several divergent implementations so have mercy on their souls
[09:37:33] <gibson042> oh well... more fodder for 1.12/2.2
[09:37:54] <DaveMethvin> i just love the smell of breaking apis in the morning!
[09:38:19] <DaveMethvin> ok then, let's call it a meeting
[09:38:40] <DaveMethvin> you guys have a great holiday!
[09:38:46] <gibson042> you too
