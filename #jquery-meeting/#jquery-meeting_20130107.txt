[09:05:12] <DaveMethvin> timmywil mikesherov rwaldron gibson042 jaubourg gnarf
[09:05:44] <gnarf> hey hey
[09:05:50] <DaveMethvin> okay i think i have the agenda set up
[09:05:51] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[09:05:54] <DaveMethvin> howya feelin?
[09:06:05] <gnarf> still really drained
[09:06:10] <gnarf> but i need to do something ;)
[09:06:23] <mikesherov> hi
[09:06:29] <DaveMethvin> at some point boredom overcomes exhaustion i guess :)
[09:07:03] <DaveMethvin> ok, well let's hope a few others drop in later
[09:07:12] <DaveMethvin> we've got a release to ship here!
[09:07:39] <timmywil> hi
[09:07:57] <DaveMethvin> hi timmywil
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> i'll never get used to google docs not having irc name completion
[09:08:27] <DaveMethvin> okay
[09:08:45] <DaveMethvin> so tomorrow i want to ship 1.9 beta 2 .. or perhaps call it rc1
[09:08:59] <DaveMethvin> we got basically no feedback on the last beta afaicr
[09:09:13] <DaveMethvin> so we might as well ship and let people actually start using it soon
[09:09:38] <DaveMethvin> what's everyone's feeling on the name? rc1?
[09:09:39] <timmywil> the only thing I want to do before final is the firefox warnings thing
[09:09:49] <DaveMethvin> ok that would be good timmywil
[09:09:51] <mikesherov> my boss just walked in, gotta run
[09:09:58] <mikesherov> I'm gonna land stuff tonight
[09:10:01] <mikesherov> Sorry guys
[09:10:01] <DaveMethvin> gnarf if you 're up to it, i'd like to get your take on .finish()
[09:10:21] <gnarf> i like it
[09:10:43] <DaveMethvin> so any idea why we never had a "finish all animations in the queue" method gnarf?
[09:11:02] <gnarf> no, but i've always thought stop true true should do that
[09:11:17] <DaveMethvin> haha, that's what i THOUGHT it did when i first used it
[09:11:26] <timmywil> heh, ditto
[09:11:35] <timmywil> all the more reason to have finish do it I think
[09:11:39] <DaveMethvin> ok so this seems like a good addition
[09:11:54] <gnarf> well, we could make .finish( true ) do it
[09:12:06] <DaveMethvin> i think finish should always do it
[09:12:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: +1
[09:12:18] <DaveMethvin> that's the most likely thing people would want
[09:12:24] <timmywil> seems more useful to me
[09:12:31] <rwaldron> Sorry, I was here earlier and no one was here, then I stepped away
[09:12:33] <rwaldron> now I'm back
[09:12:35] <gnarf> its a whole different method then
[09:12:36] <rwaldron> so.. hi!
[09:12:37] <gnarf> but yeah
[09:12:39] <DaveMethvin> if they want to only finish the first one they can .clearQueue().finish()
[09:12:46] <gnarf> i'll see if i can do something about that
[09:12:54] <DaveMethvin> well we're defining the semantics of .finish()
[09:13:19] <DaveMethvin> right now i have it doing what .stop(false, true) did but it doesn't have to do that
[09:13:30] <gnarf> yeah
[09:13:45] <gnarf> i'll try to put together some code for finish all queued anims
[09:14:01] <DaveMethvin> can you get to that today gnarf?
[09:14:14] <gnarf> p.s. - i'm updating node and phantomjs on swarm
[09:14:17] <DaveMethvin> since this is a feature we shouldn't really add it in 1.9.1
[09:14:36] <DaveMethvin> plus this will need to be in 2.0
[09:14:43] <gnarf> yeah - i'll prioritize it
[09:14:56] <gnarf> i have an idea
[09:15:27] <DaveMethvin> idea?
[09:15:40] <gnarf> for how to implement that well
[09:15:57] <gnarf> the problem is with things like .delay()
[09:16:01] <timmywil> imho, once you understand stop's arguments, a shortcut method for .stop(false, true) isn't worth much. I imagine a method to finish all animations would get used a lot more.
[09:16:17] <gnarf> or other .queue() based functions
[09:16:47] <DaveMethvin> the cases where i've wanted .finish() it's like a path animation where i want to go to the final point
[09:17:11] <DaveMethvin> so it could ignore delays
[09:17:20] <timmywil> I'd use .finish instead of .stop(true, true) in many places
[09:17:48] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: and custom queue functions?
[09:17:49] <timmywil> not that I do that as much since we added state tracking
[09:17:55] <gnarf> remove them from queue?
[09:18:16] <DaveMethvin> i suppose you could call them gnarf?
[09:18:28] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: then the next() is dangerous from that point on
[09:18:38] <DaveMethvin> oh ....  hmm
[09:18:43] <DaveMethvin> well those are pretty advanced cases
[09:18:52] <DaveMethvin> i think .finish() should be friendly to the most common caess
[09:18:53] <DaveMethvin> cases
[09:19:03] <DaveMethvin> and if someone has special needs they should do more work
[09:19:17] <gnarf> i was figuring it would a) play all animations to the end, b) clear the queue
[09:19:25] <gnarf> meaning any "custom" queues are lost
[09:19:33] <DaveMethvin> i think that's reasonable
[09:19:43] <gnarf> UI effects will hate it
[09:19:48] <DaveMethvin> that's pretty much all i want for myself
[09:20:30] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at ui effects, it uses custom queue fns i gather
[09:20:32] <gnarf> i think i might make it so that if the queued function has a "finish" method - it gets called?
[09:20:52] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a good escape hatch
[09:21:06] <gnarf> the anim can implement it's "finishing move" there too
[09:21:46] <DaveMethvin> sorry this turned out more complicated than we thought but it does seem useful
[09:21:56] <DaveMethvin> all the good ideas appear at the last minut
[09:23:02] <DaveMethvin> okay there are a couple of pulls here that we should either land or dump, the first is the context for resolving promises and that looked like it was really a bug, but i wanted to check with jaubourg on it
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> any thoughts on that from anyone else?
[09:23:27] <DaveMethvin> that's gh-1114
[09:23:58] <DaveMethvin> on the other one, a .size() method for callbacks, i'm not sure of the use case.
[09:24:18] <DaveMethvin> in retrospect i wish we hadn't exposed callbacks it's a lot of api
[09:24:48] <DaveMethvin> but there is probably some situation where someone needs to know if some callbacks are queued
[09:25:02] <gnarf> seems like a good unit
[09:25:18] <gnarf> 1114
[09:25:19] <gnarf> that is
[09:26:15] <gnarf> .size begs for a use case
[09:26:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm hesitant to add it just because someone might need it
[09:27:09] <timmywil> back in a bit
[09:27:09] <DaveMethvin> certainly there are ways to know that by tracking it yourself, if it's not a common need
[09:28:16] <DaveMethvin> the latest commit in 1114 looks a lot better
[09:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> I was wondering what the use case is also.
[09:29:35] <DaveMethvin> alright, after .finish() lands i think we have 1.9 feature complete
[09:29:49] <DaveMethvin> next week is going to be crazy
[09:30:02] <DaveMethvin> i have the "state of jquery" blog post happening on the 14th
[09:30:19] <DaveMethvin> and i am pretty sure we have at least one thing for every day next week
[09:30:36] <DaveMethvin> oh and i'm going to san francisco monday :P
[09:30:56] <DaveMethvin> well, actually going sunday and coming back tuesday
[09:31:48] <DaveMethvin> so i think we're in pretty good shape on jquery 2.0 right now
[09:31:58] <DaveMethvin> just need to be sure we don't let the behavior diverge
[09:32:48] <DaveMethvin> i would be good with what we have for 2.0 right now becoming beta 1
[09:33:12] <DaveMethvin> so orkel proposed this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1117
[09:33:47] <DaveMethvin> i can see his point, but .clean() has been around even longer than .buildFragment() so i know there are probably some plugins etc using it
[09:36:40] <DaveMethvin> we could add .clean() to the migrate plugin in case anyone needed it
[09:38:16] <DaveMethvin> trac is strange
[09:38:25] <DaveMethvin> okay there we go http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph
[09:39:57] <DaveMethvin> alright, looks like everyone else has bailed and I have to return a call
[09:40:18] <DaveMethvin> if there's anything you want in 1.9 final, get it done today please!
