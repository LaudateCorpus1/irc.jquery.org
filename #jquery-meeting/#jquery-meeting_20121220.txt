[08:00:26] <jzaefferer> Testing meeting starting in a minute! Ping scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin Krinkle|detached (booo for the detached state!) rwaldron gnarf
[08:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> Did the time change?
[08:01:27] <DaveMethvin> i thought it was 1pm but i don't have it on my cal for some reason
[08:01:42] <jzaefferer> ping mikesherov
[08:01:51] <jzaefferer> Yeah, moved an hour earlier
[08:01:55] <jzaefferer> I almost forgot as well
[08:02:03] <jzaefferer> The idea was for Krinkle to make it now
[08:02:07] <jzaefferer> So much for that
[08:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, updated on my calendar.
[08:03:04] <jzaefferer> Hi globe
[08:03:13] <globe> hey jzaefferer
[08:03:25] <mikesherov> busy
[08:03:27] <jzaefferer> for anyone who doesn't him yet, he's been filing stuff like this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/376 - and generally annoying me elsewhere ;)
[08:03:52] <globe> considering the length of other names, here…
[08:04:04] <rodneyrehm> I might as well use this one
[08:04:05] <jzaefferer> that helps
[08:04:27] <jzaefferer> so, QUnit
[08:04:31] <jzaefferer> there's this big one: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/378
[08:05:40] <jzaefferer> there's enough arguments for doing the split, but its unclear what the best approach for implementing it would be. The jQuery Core model? Using some variant of UMD?
[08:06:10] <jzaefferer> btw. agenda: http://bit.ly/qunitci
[08:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> +1 for splitting -1 for not releasing single file builds.
[08:07:32] <rodneyrehm> maybe I misphrased that. I'm not against a single build. But I don't see why I have to bother with it, if my setup is using RequireJS already
[08:07:36] <DaveMethvin> how would the user user it if it were multiple files? Would they need a submodule and build process?
[08:08:14] <DaveMethvin> i think that complicates the client project without a lot of benefit
[08:08:38] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: I commented on that in the original ticket description
[08:08:47] <jzaefferer> "jQuery Core uses QUnit as a submodule: That could be replaced by npm install qunitjs and referencing node_modules/qunit/ directly or copying the files to whereever they're supposed to live. npm modules can contain "binaries", so whatever the build outputs can be published through npm, without commiting it to Git."
[08:10:01] <DaveMethvin> is node the only use case for most QUnit users? I assumed there were some who just included the js and ran with it
[08:10:25] <DaveMethvin> i am quite happy to abandon QUnit as a submodule in any case
[08:10:33] <DaveMethvin> if it simplifies things
[08:10:37] <jzaefferer> That's the other bullet: "jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile include QUnit as copies in its externals folder. That is updated manually by copying over the files, so that shouldn't be a problem at all."
[08:10:48] <DaveMethvin> and for us at least, a npm package would be fine
[08:10:56] <jzaefferer> We've been updating manually anyway, so that shouldn't be an issue
[08:11:52] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: do you see any drawback to following the same build script approach that Core uses?
[08:12:19] <DaveMethvin> seems like a good idea to me
[08:12:32] <DaveMethvin> but i'd release a single file js as well as part of a version
[08:13:25] <jzaefferer> well, we can upload it on the CDN as we already do
[08:13:35] <jzaefferer> any other "release" you're thinking of?
[08:13:51] <DaveMethvin> no that's it
[08:14:21] <DaveMethvin> oh i misunderstood scott's  "-1 for not releasing single file builds" and i think that makes use harder for simple cases where someone just wants to include the file and doesn't have a build process
[08:14:41] <DaveMethvin> so -1 for not releasing is +1 for releasing
[08:14:44] <DaveMethvin> :P
[08:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:15:01] <DaveMethvin> and I AGREE WITH THAT
[08:15:04] <DaveMethvin> ?CC
[08:15:04] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[08:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it sounded like in the issue that you were thinking of only doing the single file generation as part of an npm install.
[08:15:49] <rodneyrehm> aside from releasing a single-build-file - can I develop qunit without having to constantly build something?
[08:15:52] <jzaefferer> so: Check out what James suggested (lodash UMD), otherwise just copy approach from Core, release single file on CDN and NPM
[08:16:23] <jzaefferer> rodneyrehm: that depends on the actual implementation, for core you have to constantly build something, which `grunt watch` can do for you
[08:16:30] <jzaefferer> its just a concat so takes <1s
[08:16:55] <DaveMethvin> plus you get a lot of benefits, linting being the biggest
[08:17:07] <rodneyrehm> not even sure why I "disliked" that approach in the first place. ignore me.
[08:17:09] <DaveMethvin> or maybe i'm the only one who makes mistakes constantly
[08:17:27] <rodneyrehm> linting/hinting should be done in the editor, but that's a beer-discussion :)
[08:18:22] <jzaefferer> alright
[08:18:39] <jzaefferer> here's a fun one, maybe DaveMethvin or scott_gonzalez or rodneyrehm, someone saw that before? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/352
[08:18:51] <jzaefferer> Just in Chrome, works fine in Firefox
[08:19:29] <DaveMethvin> i see those all the time when reverse engineering public sites
[08:19:43] <DaveMethvin> from web stats scripts and ads
[08:20:04] <rodneyrehm> yeah, I've seen them before, too. never in qunit, though.
[08:20:14] <jzaefferer> Is that a bug in Chrome? Or a feature?
[08:20:45] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[08:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure either.
[08:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome is super sensitive about iframes.
[08:21:26] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think it's our fault, and that's what matters
[08:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> Is it related to the leaking global check?
[08:22:53] <DaveMethvin> go to ebay.com, look at the console
[08:23:26] <DaveMethvin> http://wnd8.com/grab/91d68d.png
[08:23:33] <jzaefferer> whenever a test is started, the stack is extracted to display it later, while doing that, access to the stack property fails with that warning - doesn't make any sense to me
[08:24:47] <jzaefferer> oh well, some other time
[08:25:08] <jzaefferer> here's a suggestion from rodneyrehm on checking for leaking globals within source files, at load time, not just at runtime as ?noglobals does: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/347#issuecomment-11479580
[08:25:32] <jzaefferer> the idea is to let QUnit load the necessary resources, then do the globals check for each, only allowing specific globals
[08:25:38] <DaveMethvin> jshint will do that for you though, right?
[08:25:45] <jzaefferer> does it?
[08:25:50] <rodneyrehm> yes an no
[08:25:56] <jzaefferer> when doesn't it?
[08:26:15] <DaveMethvin> it does on static analysis when it lints
[08:26:23] <DaveMethvin> you tell it what's global in the config
[08:26:40] <rodneyrehm> "static analysis" being the problem…
[08:28:04] <DaveMethvin> i gotta go
[08:28:05] <rodneyrehm> anyway, the second suggestion, actually aiming at making things simpler for use with tools like testacular, would allow very simple global leak testing
[08:29:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: since you wrote that resource loader for UI, any insights here?
[08:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. I'm not really concerned about any of the potential benefits.
[08:31:22] <jzaefferer> rodneyrehm: how does the suggestion makes things easier when using testacular?
[08:32:46] <rodneyrehm> it basically reduces QUnit's loading footprint to JS only. that would have to follow in addons. that should allow loading something like the composite addon in testacular
[08:33:32] <rodneyrehm> (I haven't implemented any test to verfy this line of thought)
[08:34:43] <jzaefferer> yeah, I'd like to see a prototype for that
[08:35:11] <rodneyrehm> I figured you'd say that ;)
[08:36:10] <jzaefferer> James Green had submitted a few PRs, some landed, two are still open. I hope at the next meeting both he and Timo will be able to make it.
[08:36:38] <jzaefferer> Timo submitted a PR for node-testswarm, which I still need to test and merge: https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm/pull/7
[08:37:24] <jzaefferer> not much going on with TestSwarm otherwise
[08:37:44] <jzaefferer> the get-rid-of-iframe task is still open, mikesherov wanted to work on that as well
[08:39:18] <jzaefferer> I'll kick mergatron  off the agenda, as that gets discussed on both core and ui meetings
[08:40:16] <jzaefferer> Anyone got anything else?
[08:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> I don't.
[08:41:25] <jzaefferer> Alright, thanks everyone
[08:42:19] <jzaefferer> I guess Timo shows up later and adds a few points to the agenda, I'll wait for that before sending the update
[09:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> Today's content meeting will be delayed while ajpiano is walking to a train.
[09:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> The meeting should start by 1:30p ET.
[10:11:38] <kswedberg> thx for the heads up, @scott_gonzalez
[10:22:08] <ajpiano> hello yes i am on train
[10:22:33] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez agcolom kswedberg gnarf rwaldron
[10:22:52] <kswedberg> hi @ajpiano. I'm actually here this time. :)
[10:23:36] <ajpiano> well i hope you are prepared for ACTION
[10:23:36] <ajpiano> cause there hasn't been much
[10:23:52] <agcolom> happy birthday kswedberg ! (I hope I didn't get this wrong :-) )
[10:23:54] <kswedberg> haha.
[10:24:09] <kswedberg> thank you, agcolom! you got it right. :)
[10:24:36] <ajpiano> happy bday
[10:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> Happy birthday Karl.
[10:24:52] <ajpiano> so yeah, like i said, had a sprint the last two weeks
[10:25:01] <kswedberg> thank you, my friends.
[10:25:07] <ajpiano> next week i'm on vacay, so i'm gonna try to get the contribute.jquery stuff done
[10:25:21] <ajpiano> so that early jan we can announce those as other website things start to come together
[10:25:57] <kswedberg> ajpiano: awesome. I was going to create a CONTRIBUTE.md file in api.jquery.com. Should I not bother?
[10:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: If you have to do any web-base-template work for that, can you duplicate it into new-css as well?
[10:26:19] <ajpiano> yeah, i was just about to ask how the new-css is going
[10:26:25] <ajpiano> trying to find that google doc you sent around yesterday
[10:26:36] <ajpiano> kswedberg: you should probably create one
[10:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm all caught up on "merging" in master.
[10:26:45] <kswedberg> ajpiano. ok, will do.
[10:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gka9MDXWIa4O00JU5JaHp2hOOvyr8iiCx7Zr__I-M1M/edit#
[10:27:11] <ajpiano> but if you were gonna do that, maybe you can just create it here instead: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.com/issues/8
[10:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> I just got the last of the master commits in a few minutes ago.
[10:27:31] <ajpiano> which is general "contributing to documentation" information
[10:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> So next up is continuing to go through the sites and taking notes about what has to happen.
[10:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> I've already gone through jqueryui.com, on api.jqueryui.com now.
[10:28:26] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: awesome
[10:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll check qunitjs.com and api.qunitjs.com.
[10:28:39] <kswedberg> so, ajpiano, scott_gonzalez: is new-css still the holdup for getting the new api.jquery.com live?
[10:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: yeah
[10:29:02] <kswedberg> we have zero docs for 1.8 on the live site now. which is bad.
[10:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> But the docs are updated in the content repo?
[10:29:41] <kswedberg> yes. much more so than live at least
[10:29:45] <ajpiano> maybe we could do a stopgap solution
[10:29:57] <ajpiano> do a wordpress export from stage or something? is that a terrible idea?
[10:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's nothing stopping us from deploying api.jquery.com using master today.
[10:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> All the styling looks good?
[10:30:14] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: it's just a dns change, right?
[10:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> Should be.
[10:30:38] <ajpiano> i'm sure people willl complain about zomg y u change dox
[10:30:38] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[10:30:51] <kswedberg> yeah, whatever.
[10:30:55] <scott_gonzalez> At most, it'd be gnarf enabling the script to update the production server, adding the post-receive hook, and changing DNS.
[10:30:59] <ajpiano> at least then we'll know :D
[10:31:15] <kswedberg> I think the big thing is going to be the loss of those archived comments on the entries.
[10:31:31] <ajpiano> oh man, the ole comments
[10:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> Some of that may already be happening. There's no reason everything can't be setup with DNS just pointing at the old server right now.
[10:31:38] <kswedberg> I'm repeatedly surprised by people  telling me they actually read them.
[10:31:58] <ajpiano> kswedberg: yeah, we decided forever ago that we were just losing them
[10:32:36] <ajpiano> we have a raw dump of them/can make a fresher one, right?
[10:32:39] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I know, and I'm fine with that. I don't want them to be irretrievable, though, in case we have a huge backlash. Or do you think we should just suck it up?
[10:33:10] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what we would *do* with a hypothetical export once we take the site down
[10:33:50] <kswedberg> yeah, I dunno either.
[10:34:03] <kswedberg> I'm just being cowardly.
[10:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> umm...aren't the comments in disqus?
[10:34:29] <ajpiano> right, we could theoretically add them back
[10:34:33] <ajpiano> the urls are the same
[10:34:34] <kswedberg> yeah, both disqus and wordpress.
[10:34:53] <kswedberg> right, right. that makes sense.
[10:35:08] <kswedberg> ok, non-issue then. moving right along. :)
[10:37:17] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: how much of https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs is in the actual widget factory docs on api.jquery.com
[10:37:19] <ajpiano> jqueryui
[10:37:36] <kswedberg> the other thing is: nacin was going to work on the JSONP api, but got caught up in WP 3.5 launch stuff.
[10:37:55] <ajpiano> cause we also have https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/blob/master/page/plugins/stateful-plugins-with-widget-factory.md, which i feel like is redundant with the stuff in your repo
[10:38:06] <ajpiano> kswedberg: i really don't thinkwe should be sweating the jsonp api right now
[10:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> They're somewhat related.
[10:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is there are a few different audiences.
[10:38:46] <kswedberg> ok ajpiano.
[10:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> The stateful plugins article is basically https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs/blob/master/how-to-use-the-widget-factory.md
[10:40:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah,
[10:40:51] <ajpiano> we should probably add a jQuery UI section, then we can figure out which of this belongs there, and which belongs in general plugin authoring
[10:41:00] <ajpiano> or should it all be under jquery ui
[10:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably have it split.
[10:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> We want people reading about the widget factory whenever they read about plugins.
[10:42:09] <ajpiano> right
[10:45:14] <ajpiano> so.
[10:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> So we want to get api.jquery.com live ASAP?
[10:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> And continue working on new-css.
[10:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> Any work that happens in master should be duplicated to new-css.
[10:49:02] <ajpiano> yeah, and work on contribute content
[10:49:32] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: re master/new-css, you're referring specifically to web-base-template, yeah?
[10:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: yes
[10:49:50] <kswedberg> kthx
[10:51:51] <ajpiano> is the plan to just flip it live and let the chips fall where they may
[10:54:04] <kswedberg> yeah, I guess so.
[10:54:15] <ajpiano> merry xmas :p
[10:55:00] <kswedberg> ajpiano: is there an issue for syntax highlighting of mixed content? The JavaScript in the examples on stage.api.jquery.com aren't highlighted
[10:55:16] <ajpiano> ah yes, syntax highlighting
[10:56:38] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/55
[10:56:38] <ajpiano> an experiemnt-in-progress
[10:56:39] <ajpiano> we don't have functioning line numbers
[10:56:52] <ajpiano> i'm hoping to be able to work on sites for the first wo weeks of jan as we get ready to launch
[10:57:49] <kswedberg> gotcha
[11:04:43] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:04:51] <toddmparker> the jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:05:00] <toddmparker> chime in if you're here and on the team
[11:05:06] <_|Nix|_> !gniP
[11:05:14] <agcolom> I'm here :-)
[11:05:18] <arschmitz> hi all
[11:05:44] <scottjehl__> heyo
[11:05:53] <toddmparker> hi all
[11:06:29] <JasonDScott__> Hi
[11:06:39] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:07:42] <toddmparker> alright, guess we can start
[11:08:09] <toddmparker> Down to 130 issues thanks to Jasper and Alex’s heroic triage: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[11:08:15] <toddmparker> thanks @uGoMobi and @arschmitz
[11:08:36] <toddmparker> 1.3 is coming together, last few widgets almost there for beta:
[11:08:40] <arschmitz> i wish you were right toddmparker
[11:08:44] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:08:45] <arschmitz> but its 240 :(
[11:08:50] <toddmparker> ah, oops
[11:09:08] <toddmparker> heh
[11:09:10] <_|Nix|_> Real Soon Now™
[11:09:14] <toddmparker> wishful thinking
[11:09:14] <_|Nix|_> Good job, guys!
[11:09:17] <toddmparker> Slide panel refactor and browser testing complete for beta, working on unit tests so we can land in master. Demo: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel-refactor/docs/panels/index.html
[11:09:45] <toddmparker> zach from Filament Group is working on revising unit tests. just added destroy today
[11:09:59] <toddmparker> is bender here?
[11:10:10] <arschmitz> doesnt look it
[11:10:12] <toddmparker> I know he wanted to talk unit test strategy
[11:10:37] <scottjehl__> for panel, so far there's only a markup fixture in place
[11:10:41] <toddmparker> but panels are in great shape. did a ton of debugging yesterday
[11:10:41] <scottjehl__> needs new tests
[11:10:42] <johnbender> present!
[11:10:50] <toddmparker> hey johnbender
[11:10:51] <johnbender> zoned out after reminder went off :(
[11:10:57] <toddmparker> np
[11:11:13] <toddmparker> did you connect with scottjehl__ and zach on unit tests for panels?
[11:11:17] <scottjehl__> it's mostly all synchronous now, and the methods are pretty granular, so it should be good for test coverage
[11:11:51] <johnbender> I have not
[11:11:59] <johnbender> I've got a meeting today after lunch
[11:12:01] <johnbender> probably tomorrow
[11:12:30] <toddmparker> ok, zach will probably have some drafted up by then for you to review. any sage words of wisdom ahead of time scottjehl__ can pass along?
[11:12:30] <johnbender> I'll go over the general strategy we should take going forward too
[11:12:49] <toddmparker> yeah, having a wiki page on that would be ideal
[11:13:22] <scottjehl__> johnbender did you want to take on these tests? I'm not clear on the new test strategy
[11:13:47] <johnbender> scottjehl__: there isn't much for a new strategy
[11:13:54] <scottjehl__> k
[11:13:54] <johnbender> just try to test the methods in isolation where possible
[11:14:21] <scottjehl__> makes sense. more direct tests and less async-timeout-integration stuff?
[11:14:26] <johnbender> scottjehl__: that is, we had to do this click -> watch for change stuff because previously the functionality wasn't well exposed for testing
[11:14:30] <johnbender> scottjehl__: yes
[11:14:50] <johnbender> if we can expose it better for testing, do some refactoring to support
[11:14:58] <johnbender> our test suite will be faster and more reliable
[11:15:15] <scottjehl__> I think that makes sense. Our core widget tests should ensure that data- attrs are properly setting options, so we shouldn't have to test that for each widget
[11:15:22] <johnbender> the way it is now is just a function of how it was built when I came to it
[11:15:35] <johnbender> scottjehl__: good example
[11:15:40] <johnbender> less duplicaiton
[11:15:41] <johnbender> etc
[11:15:43] <johnbender> *duplication
[11:15:46] <scottjehl__> right on
[11:15:58] <scottjehl__> I think Zach here at FG will take this on real nice
[11:16:07] <toddmparker> cool, seems like a solid direction
[11:16:16] <johnbender> scottjehl__: at some point it would be good to get the test written in closer proximity to the actual code creation but I'm not asking for miracles just yet :)
[11:16:38] <scottjehl__> I get ya
[11:16:48] <toddmparker> problem is we had to iterate so much on panels to find a sweet spot on how CSS works
[11:17:01] <scottjehl__> so yeah, panel's in really good shape now. DONT TOUCH ANYTHING
[11:17:03] <toddmparker> hard to know exactly how the js will work up front for some things
[11:17:09] <scottjehl__> houseofcards.js
[11:17:32] <toddmparker> our secret sauce
[11:17:46] <johnbender> lol
[11:17:48] <toddmparker> other than panel for 1.3...
[11:17:50] <toddmparker> Dual handle range slider is close to landing in master. Demo: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[11:18:08] <scottjehl__> that was fast
[11:18:11] <toddmparker> uGoMobi/ arschmitz  - mind updating where we are with that?
[11:18:24] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:18:36] <johnbender> jesus I'm so out of touch
[11:18:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz finished the JS
[11:18:45] * johnbender grumbles about the nav refactor taking so long
[11:18:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: correct me if im wrong but 2 bugs remain
[11:18:55] <uGoMobi> I looked into the CSS this week
[11:19:02] <uGoMobi> sure go ahead arschmitz
[11:19:24] <arschmitz> ok we have one that is ie7 only where the first handle is under the track
[11:19:35] <gseguin> johnbender: We should think of upgrading to the latest version of requirejs
[11:20:02] <arschmitz> i think this is going to be cant fix its because of ie7 broken implementation of z-index and i dont think there is a work around
[11:20:25] <arschmitz> only way to go would be to write a fairly complex extension to move the handles
[11:20:26] <toddmparker> hmm
[11:20:39] <toddmparker> if that's the case, we need a plan B for IE7
[11:20:46] <scottjehl__> you can't fix that by appending the handle after the track?
[11:20:52] <toddmparker> like stack the sliders so they are still usable
[11:21:13] <scottjehl__> or prepend the track to the parent on create
[11:21:21] <scottjehl__> either way, source order should help I think
[11:21:22] <toddmparker> scottjehl__: interesting idea
[11:21:31] <toddmparker> so just move it in the markup?
[11:21:33] <uGoMobi> they are still usable
[11:21:48] <scottjehl__> or generate it in the right place at first
[11:21:54] <arschmitz> scottjehl__ the problem is the fact they are two stacked sliders each gets their own stacking context
[11:22:09] <arschmitz> each handle is position absolute so should break out of context
[11:22:15] <arschmitz> but ie7 doesnt do this
[11:22:17] <scottjehl__> oh....maybe the track doesn't need a context?
[11:22:33] <uGoMobi> correction.. they are not usable
[11:22:49] <uGoMobi> I just see they get broken once you start sliding
[11:22:52] <arschmitz> scottjehl the wraper that surounds the track and handle for each slider needs context
[11:22:57] <scottjehl__> two tracks, eh? seems like a stop-gap way to build it
[11:23:13] <scottjehl__> I haven't looked at it, but any reason we wouldn't use one track?
[11:23:34] <arschmitz> scottjehl__ yeah will probably merge into one widget at some point but short answer range slider is just a wrapper on two normal sliders
[11:23:52] <toddmparker> it's written as an extension to the slider
[11:23:53] <arschmitz> they are stack exactly on top of each other
[11:24:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: no its a seperate widgewt
[11:24:13] <toddmparker> oh it is now?
[11:24:16] <scottjehl__> maybe if it extended the base, it could share the same track
[11:24:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But then how come the track of the top slider doesn't cover the button of the bottom slider.
[11:24:18] <toddmparker> never mind then
[11:24:21] <_|Nix|_> ?
[11:24:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: how did you guys go about extending sliders for this?
[11:24:35] <arschmitz> we didnt its a whole new widget
[11:24:36] <johnbender> (I'll wait until you deal with the other questions for an answer)
[11:24:43] <johnbender> arschmitz: oooh nice
[11:24:45] <arschmitz> that just controils interaction between two stacked sliders
[11:24:53] <uGoMobi> it only depends on slider
[11:24:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: so you rewrote the slider?
[11:25:00] <arschmitz> no
[11:25:01] <johnbender> ah
[11:25:07] <arschmitz> slider is mostly unchanged
[11:25:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think he's using it as is.
[11:25:08] <johnbender> dreams shattered
[11:25:23] <scottjehl__> does it extend mostly like others extend, like say, listview filter?
[11:25:34] <arschmitz> scottjehl no
[11:25:38] <scottjehl__> listen for widgetcreate, add methods
[11:25:50] <arschmitz> scottjehl it doesnt extend
[11:25:54] <arschmitz> its a whole new widget
[11:26:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so the new widget contains two sliders.
[11:26:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly
[11:26:48] <scottjehl__> seems like it might just be a range option on the base widget?
[11:27:12] <scottjehl__> sorry, multi handle option, or whatever
[11:27:22] <toddmparker> well, it has to be two inputs because range doesn't support two values
[11:27:35] <toddmparker> natively, I mean
[11:28:13] <uGoMobi> ok so we have to see if we can make this work on IE7
[11:28:27] <arschmitz> I actually think i just thought of a solution
[11:28:28] <uGoMobi> didn't see an issue on WP7.5 BTW
[11:28:35] <scottjehl__> k. I dunno. Could be fine. Seems like it might also be intuitive to work it in as  $("input.foo").slider({pairwith: "input.bar"})
[11:29:00] <arschmitz> i think i might have a work around for ie7 actually
[11:29:09] <arschmitz> will need to test after meeting just thought of it
[11:29:11] <toddmparker> It would probably be good for scottjehl__ , johnbender and _|Nix|_ to take a look at the code and give arschmitz feedback offline
[11:29:14] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/range/js/widgets/forms/rangeslider.js
[11:29:18] <johnbender> toddmparker: sounds good
[11:29:40] <johnbender> looks nice and tight at first glance
[11:29:46] <toddmparker> since you guys haven't had a chance to give it a look yet. i know uGoMobi has been in there already
[11:29:48] <johnbender> testing sound fucking hard though
[11:30:02] <uGoMobi> what other issue did you have in mind arschmitz ?
[11:30:07] <johnbender> I'll take a look next week
[11:30:18] <toddmparker> oh, meant to ask - have you started writing tests for range yet?
[11:30:19] * johnbender is using profanity a lot today
[11:30:25] <johnbender> sorry about the f-bomb :(
[11:30:29] <toddmparker> put a dollar in the swear jar
[11:30:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: nope
[11:30:41] <arschmitz> just fixing that minor disabled think we talked about earlier uGoMobi:
[11:30:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[11:30:49] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[11:30:54] <uGoMobi> I have one other thing
[11:31:01] <arschmitz> no iv been waiting untill johnbender and i could connect on it been having scheduling differences this week
[11:31:01] <toddmparker> so this brings me to the topic of 1.3 beta
[11:31:24] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: scottjehl__ can we do a quick google hangout tommorrow then/
[11:31:26] <toddmparker> panels may land by tomorrow if we get the tests in order, if not next week which is a holiday week
[11:31:27] <johnbender> ?
[11:31:28] <johnbender> with zach
[11:31:44] <johnbender> shouldn't take long to go over the shift and then I can get into detail for interested parties
[11:31:54] <toddmparker> johnbender: sure. when do you want to do it?
[11:32:08] <toddmparker> it would have to be wednesday next week of not tomorrow
[11:32:23] <scottjehl__> code looks clean. just concerned with whether it should be an option on the base widget, and what that would get us in code sharing, testing, etc
[11:32:26] <toddmparker> mon/tue we're off, thu and maybe friday in a offsite
[11:32:31] <scottjehl__> api usablility
[11:32:34] <johnbender> can we do it at like 9:30am?
[11:32:35] <johnbender> pst
[11:32:46] <toddmparker> on wednesday?
[11:32:50] <johnbender> tomorrow
[11:33:33] <toddmparker> ah. that works for me. scottjehl__ and probably arschmitz and maybe uGoMobi ?
[11:33:49] <arschmitz> works for me
[11:33:50] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:33:52] <scottjehl__> ok
[11:34:06] <uGoMobi> sorry 9.30am what time zone?
[11:34:34] <johnbender> pst
[11:34:37] <toddmparker> PST
[11:34:38] <johnbender> I can get up earlier
[11:34:40] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:34:40] <toddmparker> so 12:30 EST
[11:34:53] <uGoMobi> 18.30 CET
[11:34:57] <uGoMobi> :D
[11:35:08] <johnbender> I need to bug out shortly
[11:35:10] <johnbender> can I dump my update?
[11:35:45] <toddmparker> sure johnbender
[11:35:53] <johnbender> Nav is in master
[11:35:57] <johnbender> refactored to two objects
[11:35:59] <johnbender> Navigator
[11:36:01] <johnbender> History
[11:36:21] <johnbender> $.navigate is just a proxy for a global instance of navigator
[11:38:08] <johnbender> lots of tests there now
[11:38:10] <johnbender> more to come
[11:38:18] <johnbender> need input on the method name and namespace
[11:38:40] <johnbender> $.Navigator and $.History -> $.mobile.Navigator and $.mobile.History ?
[11:38:42] <johnbender> probably
[11:38:59] <johnbender> but I'd like to break the $.mobile namespace out into it's own module to reduce dependency weight
[11:39:13] <johnbender> because the nav stuff has two deps
[11:39:15] <johnbender> err
[11:39:16] <johnbender>  3
[11:39:19] <johnbender> the navigate event
[11:39:21] <johnbender> path helpers
[11:39:22] <johnbender> and core
[11:39:29] <johnbender> well and jquery of course
[11:39:42] <toddmparker> would i make sense to cover open Q's on nav after testing tomorrow?
[11:39:43] <johnbender> so it can be used quite easily outside of the library
[11:39:49] <johnbender> sure
[11:39:55] <johnbender> just wanted input if people have it
[11:40:02] <johnbender> I'm mostly concerned about $.navigate
[11:40:04] <toddmparker> that is awesome. be cool to push the nag into a repo for standalone use.
[11:40:08] <toddmparker> nav, sorry
[11:40:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: the builder should handle that
[11:40:20] <toddmparker> ah, great
[11:40:34] <johnbender> once we get those things together
[11:40:36] <johnbender> and the tests
[11:40:38] <johnbender> I can do docs
[11:40:54] <johnbender> though some beta input would be nice before we commit to the API shape
[11:40:56] <johnbender> either way
[11:41:01] <toddmparker> great. do you want to talk about this after in -dev or tomorrow?
[11:41:13] <toddmparker> yeah, beta will be good for that
[11:41:19] <johnbender> tomorrow in the hangout would be great if it will get people to show up :)
[11:41:27] <toddmparker> but we need this documented enough for beta that people can dig in
[11:42:08] <johnbender> yessir
[11:42:13] <toddmparker> so for beta, I think I want to say this will drop "early January" now to give us time to finish up range, panel and nag loose ends
[11:42:13] <johnbender> I'll do that after the tests are in
[11:42:21] <toddmparker> but we should push to finish these asap
[11:42:26] <johnbender> yessir
[11:42:30] <toddmparker> i'll start on the blog post next week
[11:42:45] * johnbender is out!
[11:42:47] * johnbender waves
[11:42:48] <johnbender> bbl
[11:42:56] <toddmparker> i guess we need to decide if we need full test coverage for a beta
[11:43:14] * uGoMobi waves back
[11:43:46] <toddmparker> ok who wants to go next?
[11:44:00] <toddmparker> btw - i need to wrap right before 3:00 today. i have a call.
[11:44:08] <agcolom> I can be v quick
[11:44:19] <toddmparker> ok agcolom - go for it!
[11:44:23] <agcolom>     n the api docs, created entry for:
[11:44:23] <agcolom>         table toggle column mode
[11:44:23] <agcolom>         table reflow mode
[11:44:23] <agcolom>         fixedtoolbar
[11:44:52] <toddmparker> awesome
[11:44:56] <agcolom> header and footer are part of page.sections but that's not a widget...
[11:45:12] <toddmparker> right
[11:45:19] <toddmparker> so what widgets are outstanding?
[11:45:25] <agcolom> so should I move them to misc? (a section for widgets that are not actually widgets)
[11:45:45] <toddmparker> i dunno. feel like people would still look for 'em under widgets
[11:45:56] <toddmparker> maybe we just need to be clear there the situation?
[11:46:02] <uGoMobi> maybe just add a not at the bottom
[11:46:03] <scottjehl__> maybe header, content, footer should be widgets
[11:46:03] <agcolom> yes, I'm happy with that
[11:46:12] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[11:46:24] <toddmparker> so I just finished up drafting the panel docs
[11:46:25] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel-refactor/docs/panels/index.html
[11:46:28] <uGoMobi> I think we want to look into this for 1.4 anyway... make all widgets work outside a page etc.
[11:46:31] <arschmitz> scottjehl we have a few things that should be widgets we are looking at for 1.4
[11:46:32] <scottjehl__> fixed could be an option
[11:46:34] <_|Nix|_> I looked at this briefly and I remember thinking that there's a good reason they're not widgets.
[11:46:38] <scottjehl__> yeah
[11:46:38] <toddmparker> so you could start porting this over if you want
[11:46:44] <_|Nix|_> Oh, right!
[11:46:51] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: absolutely.
[11:47:10] <agcolom> I'm now using _|Nix|_'s document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7ozvhQTLhBj6sPR-LYxuev3p8kcbHjlAM8EBMlQ8GE/edit so it'll be easy to check what else needs doing... not much for widgets I think
[11:47:25] <_|Nix|_> We had a bug that seemed to require us making them widgets, but there was another solution.
[11:48:04] <toddmparker> we'll definitely review all this for 1.4
[11:48:15] <agcolom> I think just needs page, page.sections and possibly the list filter for listview
[11:48:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That'll be one giant review.
[11:48:32] <toddmparker> that is great. you're done an amazing job agcolom
[11:48:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Come to think of it, we should probably go one widget at a time.
[11:48:48] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yeah, and review it together
[11:48:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that was kind of my thinking
[11:48:59] <agcolom> thanks! now, I'm on holiday until the 9th :-)
[11:49:07] <toddmparker> we also need to agree on some up-front criteria of what every widgets should have
[11:49:14] <uGoMobi> enjoy your holiday agcolom
[11:49:21] <toddmparker> have a nice vacation!
[11:49:31] <toddmparker> who
[11:49:35] <toddmparker> is next
[11:49:37] <agcolom> thanks!
[11:49:42] <arschmitz> i can i have very little
[11:50:15] <arschmitz> already went over range
[11:50:29] <arschmitz> other then that just working on some demos and triage / bug fixing
[11:50:33] <arschmitz> DONE!
[11:50:42] <uGoMobi> ok I ll be quick too
[11:50:51] <uGoMobi> triage, range already discussed
[11:51:03] <uGoMobi> made slider and input together full width (fix is in branch “range”)
[11:51:03] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045
[11:51:09] <toddmparker> bam, thanks arschmitz
[11:51:18] <uGoMobi> that's a feature request for 1.3
[11:51:19] <toddmparker> range is looking great guys
[11:51:44] <arschmitz> yeah and i dont think ie7 will be a huge issue after all
[11:51:46] <uGoMobi> i want to discuss what to to with the input of slider on small screens
[11:51:51] <toddmparker> think range and panels are the only 1.3 additions not in master yet
[11:52:00] <toddmparker> arschmitz: good to hear
[11:52:02] <uGoMobi> because rangeslider will have the inputs above the slider
[11:52:08] <toddmparker> it's not horrible to use now, just odd
[11:52:21] <toddmparker> i was playing with it
[11:52:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: +1 on making it match range
[11:52:33] <toddmparker> ok _|Nix|_ ?
[11:52:48] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* I was hoping to have a demo up by now, but clone jQM is a beast ...
[11:52:57] <_|Nix|_> Been working mostly on web-ui-fw.
[11:53:06] <_|Nix|_> Some stuff popped out of there, useful for jQM.
[11:53:18] <_|Nix|_> Like, I separated out the view-source stuff so I could reuse it.
[11:53:29] <_|Nix|_> Fixed up index.php so it works as a submodule.
[11:53:40] <_|Nix|_> I mean so it retrieves the commitid even when jqm is a submodule.
[11:53:57] <_|Nix|_> ... and I'm gonna be on vacation until Jan 2.
[11:54:10] <_|Nix|_> ... and I gave the two Samsung guys commit access to web-ui-fw.
[11:54:26] <_|Nix|_> ... and I restructured web-ui-fw to be as much like jqm as possible.
[11:55:07] <_|Nix|_> Basically, web-ui-fw is gonna have AMD dependencies into jQM, so it should be possible to extend the download builder fairly seamlessly to include both jQM and web-ui-fw.
[11:55:08] <toddmparker> awesome, good to have you cranking on that
[11:55:17] <toddmparker> think your work will help everyone be more productive
[11:55:31] <toddmparker> nice if we can link to the download builder
[11:55:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I hope I can bring web-ui-fw up to par.
[11:55:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's a really long shot for now.
[11:55:47] <toddmparker> might be cool to work with gseguin on that for 3rd party widgets
[11:56:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I still need to build up a unit test framework á la jQM.
[11:56:05] <gseguin> I'll be happy to help
[11:56:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: from what you have been saying i thikn its going to be pretty awesome
[11:56:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm hoping it will be at least as awesome as jQM. But that's a tall order for now.
[11:56:49] <_|Nix|_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/
[11:56:52] <_|Nix|_> Yaaaay!
[11:56:52] <toddmparker> well grind away at for a while and we can discuss what you think later
[11:56:58] <_|Nix|_> I got the demo up and running :)
[11:57:07] <toddmparker> nice
[11:57:25] <_|Nix|_> The list of widgets alone is impressive ;)
[11:57:40] <toddmparker> yeah, it is
[11:57:53] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:57:58] <toddmparker> anyone else not go yet?
[11:58:10] <toddmparker> gseguin?
[11:58:13] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: FYI - Keith said he would finish the grid listview demo
[11:58:21] <gseguin> no update
[11:58:35] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[11:58:40] <toddmparker> gseguin: you're fired.
[11:58:45] <gseguin> again?!
[11:58:47] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:58:48] <gseguin> oh man!
[11:59:06] <arschmitz> gseguin will you keep your job through a whole meeting for once!
[11:59:17] <toddmparker> heh
[11:59:26] <toddmparker> alright, you're back. can't fire anyone at x-mas
[11:59:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sounds like you are fhired
[11:59:42] <gseguin> awww... thanks
[11:59:44] <toddmparker> next week, i'll try to have the meeting, should be online
[11:59:59] <gseguin> I should be online over the holidays
[12:00:05] <uGoMobi> same here
[12:00:09] <gseguin> but still busy with tasks here
[12:00:12] <arschmitz> ill be around
[12:00:12] <_|Nix|_> ... and I should be able to look in from time to time
[12:00:23] <gseguin> hopefully I'll come back to my 40% in Jan
[12:00:40] <agcolom> I don't think I'll be able to make it... I'll send an email with any update
[12:00:41] <_|Nix|_> That'd be awesome!
[12:00:48] <toddmparker> ok, we'll check in for sure
[12:01:00] <toddmparker> alright, gotta hop off. sorry
[12:01:11] <arschmitz> bye toddmparker
[12:01:14] <gseguin> later
[12:01:15] <uGoMobi> ok see you all on -dev
[12:01:18] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[12:01:29] <gseguin> I'll switch off the lights
