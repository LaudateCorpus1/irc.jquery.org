[14:05:32] <arschmitz> agcolom_: apsdehal1: jasperdegroot: sfrisk: gabriels1hulhof: meeting time
[14:05:58] <apsdehal> Hi
[14:06:01] <apsdehal> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=1695085088
[14:06:22] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:06:48] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:06:55] <arschmitz> selectmenu is on 1.5-dev
[14:06:56] <arschmitz> yay
[14:07:02] <apsdehal> awesome
[14:07:04] <jasperdegroot> awesome
[14:07:18] <arschmitz> im going to push some test fixes and merge back to master asap
[14:07:38] <apsdehal> Probably wait for my PRs to merge?
[14:07:43] <apsdehal> Contains fixes for demos
[14:07:49] <arschmitz> thats fine
[14:07:59] <arschmitz> i then want to do an alpha asap
[14:08:06] <arschmitz> we wont have updated docs
[14:08:15] <arschmitz> but we can make those a beta block safely i think
[14:08:22] <arschmitz> same wth upgrade guide
[14:08:29] <arschmitz> but we will have change log and demos
[14:08:59] <jasperdegroot> yeah let's do an alpha asap
[14:10:14] <jasperdegroot> and make sure we have a ticket with a checklist for all docs that need to be updated
[14:10:43] <arschmitz> yes
[14:11:05] <arschmitz> ok next
[14:11:20] <arschmitz> 2 weeks ago we discussed listview count bubbles and just demoing large numbers
[14:11:27] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:11:29] <arschmitz> but i have a suggestion to better handle this by default
[14:11:46] <arschmitz> apsdehal: do you have that ticket handy
[14:11:51] <apsdehal> Yes
[14:12:10] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8439
[14:12:14] <arschmitz> i put a bin with my suggestion in the ticket
[14:12:30] <jasperdegroot> do you place the bubble inline?
[14:12:45] <arschmitz> no absolute from the right
[14:12:51] <arschmitz> so it expands left
[14:12:59] <arschmitz> it was already absolute right
[14:13:04] <jasperdegroot> yup
[14:13:12] <arschmitz> i just adjusted the placment to switch with the carat
[14:13:36] <arschmitz> which to me makes more sense anyway then moving the carat since it makes listviews in general more consistent i think
[14:14:10] <arschmitz> so im curious others thoughts on making this change
[14:14:14] <jasperdegroot> right, but that still requires extra padding for the button if it's a big number, doesn't it?
[14:15:09] <arschmitz> kinda not really
[14:15:17] <arschmitz> i mean yes if you have super long text
[14:15:27] <arschmitz> or a CRAZY long number or really narrow list
[14:15:30] <arschmitz> they could over lap
[14:15:37] <arschmitz> but the carat and the text can normally too
[14:15:47] <arschmitz> thats kinda your responsibility to be reasonable i think
[14:17:41] <jasperdegroot> I think the switch of the count bubble and carat is an improvement
[14:17:47] <arschmitz> i agree
[14:17:57] <arschmitz> and for 99% of cases the padding is fine
[14:18:11] <arschmitz> and at some point custom css is a thing
[14:18:40] <jasperdegroot> but we could still add a demo how to add extra padding
[14:18:45] <arschmitz> sure
[14:18:58] <arschmitz> but unless we get a bug i would probably not worry about it
[14:18:59] <jasperdegroot> simple example is list of blog posts
[14:19:08] <jasperdegroot> and count bubble for number of comments
[14:19:09] <arschmitz> if we do get a bug we can add a demo
[14:19:25] <jasperdegroot> or email inbox with count bubble for number of replies or something
[14:19:38] <arschmitz> yeah that was my exaple for why this was a valid use case
[14:19:39] <arschmitz> email
[14:20:10] <jasperdegroot> but we can never fix this in the framework so I think having people adjust the padding themselves is fine
[14:20:15] <arschmitz> yup
[14:20:24] <jasperdegroot> a demo for that would not be highest priority but nice to have
[14:20:30] <arschmitz> apsdehal: you mentioned this to me so did you want to take that one?
[14:20:49] <arschmitz> its a simple change so would like this in the alpha
[14:21:10] <apsdehal> Yes. so I only have to make change in demos right?
[14:21:15] <arschmitz> no
[14:21:23] <arschmitz> this is an actual code change
[14:21:28] <arschmitz> to swap places
[14:21:34] <arschmitz> ( well css but same thing )
[14:21:39] <apsdehal> Ok I will check your fiddle
[14:21:41] <jasperdegroot> we have to be careful because I custom selectmenu is using count bubble too
[14:21:57] <arschmitz> ah right so double check we dont break custom select
[14:22:03] <jasperdegroot> exactly
[14:22:05] <arschmitz> but i think that uses its own css
[14:22:15] <apsdehal> Yes, I will go through demos after I make changes
[14:22:16] <arschmitz> because the position is different i think and no carat
[14:22:17] <jasperdegroot> could be, don't remember
[14:22:34] <arschmitz> oh
[14:22:38] <arschmitz> and its in a button not a listview
[14:22:48] <arschmitz> so at worst scope the rule to listview if its not already
[14:23:18] <arschmitz> it is already i just checked
[14:23:21] <jasperdegroot> yes
[14:23:25] <arschmitz> my fiddle uses the actual selectors from the lib
[14:23:29] <jasperdegroot> ok perfect
[14:23:32] <arschmitz> and they are all scoped to listview
[14:23:35] <arschmitz> so easy fix
[14:23:51] <apsdehal> Cool, I will open up a PR
[14:23:52] <jasperdegroot> and no listview classes in custom select anymore?
[14:24:02] <arschmitz> maybe but the count is in the button
[14:24:04] <jasperdegroot> well, just something to double check after the change
[14:24:05] <arschmitz> not in the listview
[14:24:11] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:24:13] <arschmitz> so it wouldnt matter
[14:25:25] <arschmitz> those are the things i wanted to make sure we covered this week
[14:25:37] <arschmitz> apsdehal: anything you wanted to go over for issues?
[14:25:39] <apsdehal> Ok, so I will go next with some issues
[14:25:42] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7380
[14:25:58] <apsdehal> Should we do something about this? ^
[14:26:21] <arschmitz> i think that makes sense
[14:26:36] <arschmitz> we do it inside panels i think already
[14:26:38] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:26:43] <arschmitz> to prevent them from closing
[14:26:49] <jasperdegroot> was about to mention panel
[14:27:00] <jasperdegroot> I remember we had the same issue there
[14:27:24] <arschmitz> yup
[14:27:33] <arschmitz> so i think we should probably remove special panel handling
[14:27:39] <arschmitz> and move to do it by default
[14:27:50] <arschmitz> from within the widget
[14:27:53] <apsdehal> For every widget?
[14:27:56] <arschmitz> no
[14:28:11] <arschmitz> just slider and flipswitch
[14:28:17] <arschmitz> those are only ones this should effect
[14:28:31] <apsdehal> Ok, from within the widget not from swipe
[14:28:37] <arschmitz> right
[14:28:57] <apsdehal> So currently swipe specially handles panel
[14:29:02] <arschmitz> this._on( { swipe: function( e ) { e.preventDefault(); } );
[14:29:03] <arschmitz> basicly
[14:29:14] <arschmitz> no
[14:29:20] <arschmitz> panel specials hanles swipe
[14:29:46] <apsdehal> Ok, I will make changes in flipswitch and slider
[14:29:56] <apsdehal> ok, next issue.
[14:30:07] <arschmitz> oh and sorry
[14:30:12] <arschmitz> you want stopPropagation
[14:30:16] <arschmitz> not preventDefault
[14:30:24] <apsdehal> Yes, got that.
[14:30:27] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8246
[14:30:32] <apsdehal> jasperdegroot: ^
[14:30:41] * jasperdegroot looking
[14:30:47] <apsdehal> I saw help wanted tag, can you specify which all to remove
[14:30:59] <arschmitz> we should probably use a tool for this
[14:31:06] <arschmitz> there are grunt plugins that handle it for you
[14:31:29] <jasperdegroot> yeah i added the help wanted label because this is an easy thing to do so could be something for someone from the community to get involved
[14:31:50] <jasperdegroot> yeah, we could switch to autoprefix
[14:32:06] <jasperdegroot> and just define browser support
[14:32:10] <arschmitz> that was my thought
[14:32:26] <jasperdegroot> I can take care of that
[14:32:55] <jasperdegroot> will comment on the ticket that we will add a grunt task
[14:32:56] <arschmitz> awesome thank you
[14:33:11] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8359
[14:33:55] <arschmitz> cases like that
[14:34:00] <arschmitz> ask them to make the bin anyway
[14:34:00] <apsdehal> I have a feeling this is somehow linked to not having any history
[14:34:07] <arschmitz> then you have the code to make into an app to test
[14:34:25] <apsdehal> Ok, I will ask.
[14:34:42] <arschmitz> you should be able to make it with cordova then run it in a simulator
[14:35:10] <arschmitz> but knowing his exact code that reporduces is first step
[14:35:26] <arschmitz> another trick we have always done with android
[14:35:28] <jasperdegroot> and see if it's a windows specific issue
[14:35:39] <arschmitz> is we have an app thats just a webview with a url bar
[14:35:40] <jasperdegroot> maybe the same problem occurs on other platform
[14:35:45] <arschmitz> so we can load bins in cordova
[14:36:03] <apsdehal> Oh nice.
[14:36:20] <apsdehal> Do you have it somewhere?
[14:36:32] <jasperdegroot> on my phone ;)
[14:36:34] <arschmitz> a community member made it years ago have to see if its still available somewhere
[14:36:40] <arschmitz> yeah same here just on some devices
[14:36:46] <jasperdegroot> I have the apk for you apsdehal
[14:37:01] <arschmitz> its really helpful
[14:37:07] <apsdehal> Thanks. Please mail it to me.
[14:37:26] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8413 This I wanted to discuss with gabriels1hulhof
[14:37:54] <apsdehal> If we are going to support multiple selects anytime soon.
[14:38:17] <arschmitz> so this is more then that
[14:38:28] <arschmitz> we dont officially support filtering custom select at all i dont think
[14:39:01] <arschmitz> we made a demo but its not official support because it does not address many edge cases etc not built in
[14:39:09] <arschmitz> maybe we should consider removing the demo
[14:39:17] <arschmitz> but i would want gabriels input on that
[14:39:33] <apsdehal> yes, I will push it to next week's meeting
[14:40:15] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7167 jasperdegroot
[14:40:18] <arschmitz> thats really more of a combo box with autocomplete at that point
[14:40:37] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: can you send me your email in a pm
[14:40:43] <arschmitz> c grade is where we relagte unsupported browsers
[14:40:50] <arschmitz> essentially
[14:40:59] <arschmitz> they get only html and css no JS
[14:41:17] <apsdehal> So how we do that
[14:41:49] <jasperdegroot> in case of opera mini we would have to do it in support.js
[14:42:39] * apsdehal time is less, issues are many :(
[14:43:27] <jasperdegroot> it's sad that I didn't add a comment to that ticket :/
[14:43:50] <apsdehal> I will fix it, just need to know how.
[14:44:00] <arschmitz> apsdehal: great job on issue count
[14:44:00] <jasperdegroot> now I don't remember exactly which problems we had with opera mini
[14:44:11] <jasperdegroot> yeah +1, amazing job!
[14:44:18] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Thanks for your constant support
[14:44:21] <arschmitz> we have not had a count this low since pre alpha 1
[14:44:25] <apsdehal> jasperdegroot: you too
[14:44:52] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6682
[14:45:09] <apsdehal> jasperdegroot: let's leave it for next meeting :p you figure out things
[14:45:29] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:45:30] <apsdehal> ^^ Was any final discussion made on this one?
[14:46:02] <apsdehal> jasperdegroot: There must be a spec for opera mini from where you consulted.
[14:47:33] <jasperdegroot> reading old tickets now
[14:48:10] <arschmitz> we just shouldnt demo that
[14:49:19] <apsdehal> Two demos to be removed now
[14:49:30] <apsdehal> Hmm, I will remove them
[14:49:49] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8355
[14:49:56] <arschmitz> if its not consistently supported we should not show it
[14:50:10] <apsdehal> ^ Anyone remember where did get our regex from?
[14:50:25] <arschmitz> gabriels1hulhof: did ALL of that work
[14:51:00] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/navigation/path.js#L41
[14:51:48] <apsdehal> In this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8247
[14:52:07] <apsdehal> Shedding backcompat for some breaks everything, I don't think they are just ready yet
[14:52:58] <arschmitz> yeah there are updates nessasarry in tests generally
[14:53:58] <apsdehal> hmm, this was all I have. many of the issues now left are targetting 1.6
[14:55:37] <arschmitz> execlent thank you for all the hard work
[14:56:02] <apsdehal> :)
