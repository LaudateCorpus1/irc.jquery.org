[11:04:20] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:04:25] <abub_> hello
[11:04:29] <toddparker> jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting
[11:04:32] <gseguin> hi
[11:04:38] <abub_> link?
[11:04:56] <gseguin> Just a quick status from me
[11:05:19] <toddparker> Simulcast in this hangout: https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/69aec99c98168dfd142ba19d77b9e419827f7f08?authuser=0&hl=en
[11:05:33] <toddparker> Just for listening please
[11:05:35] <gseguin> builder zip is working
[11:05:39] <toddparker> we'll post notes here in IRC
[11:05:40] <Wilto> Filmed before a live studio audience.
[11:05:58] <toddparker> ok, first order: download builder
[11:05:59] <gseguin> working on the filter that prepends the copyright
[11:06:10] <toddparker> good progress all around
[11:06:15] <gseguin> and then I'll sort the item on the page alphabetically
[11:06:19] <toddparker> so we have zips
[11:06:23] <toddparker> horray
[11:06:36] <toddparker> prepends the copyright to the file?
[11:06:38] <gseguin> zip contains .js, .min.js, .css, .min.css
[11:06:58] <gseguin> yeah to all these files and prepend the right copyright
[11:08:41] * gseguin goes quiet
[11:08:53] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:09:15] <toddparker> so after that sorting
[11:09:23] <toddparker> and then server stuff, right?
[11:09:31] <toddparker> are you on video?
[11:11:21] <toddparker> sounds like we need some time for infra
[11:13:07] <toddparker> so we will start with this as a limited alpha on the current server to see how the load will work out
[11:13:47] <toddparker> caching will be used, not sure if built yet
[11:16:33] <toddparker> next
[11:16:37] <toddparker> 1.1.0 final
[11:17:17] <toddparker> aim to release tomorrow morning
[11:25:15] <toddparker> next
[11:25:29] <toddparker> theme roller - new version will support 1.0 and 1.1
[11:25:35] <toddparker> and an upgrade path between both
[11:25:41] <toddparker> new: undo and redo stack
[11:26:20] <toddparker> add to blog post
[11:30:14] <toddparker> todd will update docs for 1.1, bender will do a release so TR can get staged up today
[11:32:39] <toddparker> next topic
[11:32:53] <toddparker> roadmap
[11:33:06] <toddparker> focus on bug fixes in short term
[11:33:35] <toddparker> re-factor for modularity
[11:34:05] <toddparker> more sane API for advanced developers
[11:34:15] <toddparker> ex. transitions
[11:39:41] <toddparker> need better solutions for managing back button in nav - popups need this
[11:40:01] <toddparker> ui states
[11:47:04] <toddparker> look into upgrading the widget factory
[11:50:33] <gnarf> what was the question about UI?
[11:51:58] <abub_> Need to drop off for a dentist appt, Todd can you contact me in the afternoon? we would like to check with you if jQueryMobile would be a co-sponsor for the hackathon in san fran
[12:16:49] <toddparker> gnarf
[12:17:07] <toddparker> we were just looking to confirm the latest and greatest version of the widget factory
[12:17:07] <toddparker> we're
[12:17:16] <toddparker> looking to drop that in and see what breaks
[12:17:40] <toddparker> abub: sure, send me an email
[12:18:04] <toddparker> our tentative decision is to move fetch link out to 1.3 and focus on popup and making history work well with it
[12:18:17] <toddparker> need to see if it makes sense to use UI's position util
[12:18:26] <toddparker> alright, that's it. go team!
[12:18:29] <toddparker> thanks all
