[11:19:11] <gabrielschulhof> Hey, all!
[11:19:14] <gabrielschulhof> Sorry I'm late!
[11:21:01] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sounds good let me know when it needs review
[11:21:40] <agcolom> I have a question...
[11:21:42] <jasperdegroot> yes will open a PR when ready
[11:21:58] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/382
[11:22:34] <agcolom> do we need to cherry-pick or do we worry about 1-5 later? (i.e. rebase or something then?)
[11:24:11] <arschmitz> need to cherry pick
[11:24:58] <agcolom> ok, I'm worried of messing things up...
[11:25:31] <agcolom> I'm happy to land this PR, and then can I go through the steps for cherry-picking with someone?
[11:25:44] <agcolom> (unless someone is happy to do the cherry-picking for me?)
[11:25:59] <arschmitz> agcolom: land on master and ping me
[11:26:01] <arschmitz> ill help
[11:28:11] <agcolom> but if I can have a step by step guide, then I can do the following ones as well... there will be more I think
[11:28:50] <agcolom> arschmitz: fantastic! Thanks!
[11:32:42] <agcolom> that's it from me
[11:36:46] <arschmitz> ok
[11:36:57] <arschmitz> any thing else from anyone?
[11:37:11] <jasperdegroot> no I am good
[11:37:19] <agcolom> oh, there was a q on twitter
[11:37:28] <agcolom> when will 1.5 be ready?
[11:37:46] <agcolom> roughly?
[11:39:32] <cgack> https://twitter.com/raymondcamden/status/618743478332190720
[11:40:21] <gabrielschulhof> *sigh* ... tough question ...
[11:40:59] <arschmitz> um trudging along
[11:41:07] <arschmitz> wish we had a better update
[11:41:16] <arschmitz> iv been telling him that forever i feel like
[11:41:32] <arschmitz> things just keep taking a long time
[11:42:00] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, so speaking of ... I've been slowly digging into selectmenu ...
[11:42:14] <gabrielschulhof> Got the icon span up and running ... yaaay :)
[11:42:18] <arschmitz> sweet
[11:42:32] <gabrielschulhof> ... and some calls to \.(add|remove|toggle)Class replaced
[11:42:56] <gabrielschulhof> ... but I've been basing it off of the listview classes PR, because selectmenu uses listview, so I wanted the classes to line up.
[11:43:02] <arschmitz> so after that its panel then beta right?
[11:43:09] <arschmitz> ok
[11:43:15] * gabrielschulhof whispers "table"
[11:43:21] <arschmitz> oh yeah
[11:43:34] <arschmitz> ok so gtting there
[11:43:48] <arschmitz> wasent listview done?
[11:43:48] <gabrielschulhof> It's like when you scale a peak only to find that it's a bump along the way to the real peak, which is much further.
[11:43:56] <gabrielschulhof> Yes.
[11:44:03] <gabrielschulhof> Review should be straight forward.
[11:44:07] <arschmitz> ok
[11:44:24] <arschmitz> ill put that on my high priority list
[11:44:34] <gabrielschulhof> Cool. Thanks!
[11:45:02] <arschmitz> new job is in middle of cutting a beta lol so a little crazy since i was also out of country
[11:45:10] <arschmitz> and unexpectedly so without wifi
