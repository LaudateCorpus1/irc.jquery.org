[08:59:02] <DaveMethvin> .
[08:59:08] <DaveMethvin> here oily!
[09:01:57] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:02:01] <gibson042> hello
[09:02:05] <rwaldron> here
[09:02:07] <jaubourg> hi
[09:02:14] <DaveMethvin> should be a short meeting
[09:02:15] <jaubourg> sorry for being late
[09:02:26] <rwaldron> 2 mins?
[09:02:28] <rwaldron> <3 jaubourg
[09:02:35] <DaveMethvin> not THAT short
[09:02:56] <jaubourg> lol
[09:03:01] <jaubourg> hey rwaldron
[09:03:28] <DaveMethvin> so i definitely want to get a release out this week ... can't decide whether it shoudl be an rc or final
[09:03:39] <DaveMethvin> it may depend on what else we land i suppose
[09:03:44] <jaubourg> depends, do we pass all unit tests?
[09:03:52] <DaveMethvin> there's some chrome problem with ajax
[09:04:01] <DaveMethvin> i guess you saw that?
[09:04:04] <DaveMethvin> comes and goes
[09:04:15] <jaubourg> yeah, it's about the HEAD requests and I think it has to do with both Chromes sharing something
[09:04:28] <jaubourg> sometimes it's one version, sometimes the other
[09:04:38] <DaveMethvin> i had a similar caching issue with event this morning
[09:04:51] <DaveMethvin> i thought testswarm did a fresh checkout of head
[09:04:52] <jaubourg> I honestly dunno how to handle this situation
[09:04:57] <jaubourg> I cannot reproduce locally
[09:05:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah, if i reload to eliminate the cached version it works fine
[09:05:31] <gibson042> timmywil wanted to include fixes for selector parsing, but I've been looking at it too and they might not be ready this week
[09:05:43] <DaveMethvin> maybe we need to check with Krinkle and see what is going on in swarm
[09:05:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah the selector stuff seems important
[09:06:11] <DaveMethvin> we *could* release an rc and put them in after, but that seems like cheating
[09:06:24] <jaubourg> yeah, probably better to wait for them
[09:06:36] <jaubourg> unless we have vital bug fixes right now?
[09:06:40] <DaveMethvin> could they be in later this week?
[09:06:43] <jaubourg> I mean like blocker vital
[09:07:01] <gibson042> it's possible, but I don't know if it's likely
[09:07:08] <DaveMethvin> well there are several issues like the ie problem that are pretty important to get out
[09:07:23] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't make sense to ship 1.8.1 with several outstanding big bugs
[09:07:26] <jaubourg> true
[09:08:09] <DaveMethvin> ok well let's play this loose but try to aim for Thursday if possible
[09:08:10] <jaubourg> maybe we could iterate fast here, but seems too fast (like 1.8.1 then a week later 1.8.2)... and 1.8.1RC without selector fixes is REALLY cheating
[09:08:47] <DaveMethvin> imma play wishful thinking and still hope for Thursday
[09:09:28] <gibson042> for the RC?
[09:09:51] <DaveMethvin> still depends on what tickets land
[09:09:58] <gibson042> ok
[09:10:13] <DaveMethvin> so just to get our minds out of the maintenance rut ....
[09:10:20] <DaveMethvin> jQuery 1.9 and 2.0!
[09:10:25] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:10:52] <DaveMethvin> if you have tix you want to talk about for that and they need some decisions, mark them in the tracker
[09:11:15] <jaubourg> what's the tag? 1.9?
[09:11:26] <DaveMethvin> 1.9-discuss in the keywords
[09:11:27] <jaubourg> -discuss
[09:11:29] <jaubourg> ok
[09:11:40] <DaveMethvin> or 2.0-discuss for the REALLY fun stuff :D
[09:11:51] <DaveMethvin> if you just want to take one already slotted for those releases go ahead
[09:12:09] <DaveMethvin> you probably saw the email about the hackfest coming up in october
[09:12:21] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:12:31] <DaveMethvin> we're still tryna figure out exactly what we'll be doing there, but want to involve some community folks
[09:12:44] <DaveMethvin> perhaps we can have a list of easy stuff for them to do from our list
[09:12:48] <jaubourg> I always picture blood baths and vampires... dunno why this "fest" suffix brings goth pictures in my mind
[09:13:00] * jaubourg is sane, oh yes, very sane
[09:13:06] <jaubourg> :>
[09:13:16] <DaveMethvin> i know what you mean jaubourg, slugfest always makes me think of slugs wearing party  hats.
[09:13:28] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:13:48] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno how we get ppl to look at our alphas and betas more
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> i am SOOO tired of releasing a .0 and only then getting anyone to try it and report problems
[09:14:06] <jaubourg> grab them by the neck?
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to have a much longer test period for 1.9/2.0
[09:14:40] <DaveMethvin> and back it up with some blog posts explaining what we are doing
[09:14:47] <jaubourg> truth be told, it's not easy to just push in an alpha or a beta even in test envs within most companies
[09:14:47] <DaveMethvin> "we're breaking shit, so test this"
[09:14:55] <jaubourg> and THAT's where the bugs are discovered
[09:15:07] <DaveMethvin> well at least the blog posts will make it clear what we're removing
[09:15:26] <DaveMethvin> they'll need to be bite-sized posts just dealing with one major thing at a time
[09:16:02] <DaveMethvin> i don't have a problem writing them, just want to make sure nobody gets bent out of shape by all the stuff being changed
[09:16:06] <DaveMethvin> i mean,they  WILL
[09:16:13] <jaubourg> let's see, we're removing ajax, effect, the selector engine and all helpers, right? We just keep .ready(), and only for Chrome 34+ right?
[09:16:19] <DaveMethvin> but at least we warned them
[09:16:24] <DaveMethvin> sounds about right jaubourg
[09:16:26] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:16:28] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:16:39] <DaveMethvin> gotta do that to get under 10k
[09:16:53] <jaubourg> haha
[09:16:55] <DaveMethvin> we'll get it to 24k and let gibson042 do the rest :P
[09:17:09] <gibson042> lol
[09:17:16] <jaubourg> "let gibson042 do the rest" should be our new motto on the website front page
[09:17:34] <jaubourg> sounds about right
[09:17:37] <jaubourg> ;)
[09:17:38] <DaveMethvin> okay well that about does it for me, all we have to do is fix the bugs and ship
[09:17:43] <DaveMethvin> easy peasy
[09:17:48] <rwaldron> jaubourg is right.. I think we frequently see reports from idiots that are hotlinking to http://code.jquery.com/jquery(min).js and google cdn w/o a version
[09:18:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have wondered if we should stop having those but that probably breaks more than we could ever know
[09:18:31] <DaveMethvin> jquery-latest etc
[09:18:35] <gibson042> we could always slip and temporarily symlink that to jquery-git.js
[09:18:35] <rwaldron> I think that will break the web
[09:18:41] <rwaldron> as in, the whole thing
[09:18:50] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: i like the way you think <evil grin>
[09:18:52] <gibson042> that'll get advance testing :P
[09:18:53] <jaubourg> we should break the web in that instance, it's for our users own good
[09:18:55] <rwaldron> gibson042 might be onto something
[09:19:03] <rwaldron> 24 hours
[09:19:08] <jaubourg> +1 gibson042
[09:19:12] <rwaldron> restore it and wait for reports
[09:19:14] <rwaldron> fix them
[09:19:17] <rwaldron> and do it again
[09:19:26] <DaveMethvin> "whoops we did it again"
[09:19:29] <jaubourg> maybe put it in place when swamp says it passes all tests?
[09:19:41] <jaubourg> could work without too much breakage
[09:19:51] <jaubourg> and since we never pass all tests...
[09:19:57] <DaveMethvin> anyone crazy enough to use jquery-latest is gonna be doing other crazy stuff
[09:20:06] <rwaldron> truth
[09:20:11] <DaveMethvin> just in time timmywil, we're about to wrap up
[09:20:15] <jaubourg> yeah but we love them crazies
[09:20:32] <gibson042> other than that, it'd sure be nice if we could specifically notify plugin authors that a new version is coming
[09:20:45] <jaubourg> yeah, that's the things I hate most
[09:20:52] <timmywil> Hey there, on my phone
[09:20:53] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: good point, that is also why i want to do the series of blog posts
[09:20:54] <jaubourg> that end user are unaware, unprepared, I can get
[09:21:00] <jaubourg> but plugin authors?
[09:21:09] <jaubourg> we have to work on our plugin ecosystem, badly
[09:21:22] <DaveMethvin> we can't really wait for almost-release to remind people of what is being removed
[09:21:30] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: step one would be to have a plugin site :D
[09:21:41] <rwaldron> gibson042 definite
[09:21:41] <jaubourg> ajpiano? :P
[09:21:55] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: would you be able to have the sizzle fixes ready by thursday?
[09:21:57] <rwaldron> wait, what happened to our Wordpress homies
[09:22:00] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: yeah and we need a medium to communicate better with plugin authors
[09:22:14] <rwaldron> they promised to give us test deploys against the hosted Wordpress system
[09:22:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: Yea I think so
[09:22:23] <jaubourg> timmywil: can you do my laundry by wednesday?
[09:22:23] <DaveMethvin> excellent
[09:22:35] <rwaldron> since they have redundancy, we can test against all of the hosted wordpress sites without breaking the real sites
[09:22:42] <DaveMethvin> closed/wontwash
[09:22:42] <rwaldron> They promised!
[09:22:46] <jaubourg> and hi timmy :)
[09:22:55] <timmywil> jaubourg: WAY too much grime
[09:23:02] <jaubourg> :/
[09:23:25] <timmywil> :)
[09:23:51] <DaveMethvin> boxers:not(:contains(stains)) seems to be broken in 1.8.0
[09:23:52] <jaubourg> wordpress.promise( "transparentTests" )
[09:24:12] <DaveMethvin> okay then, i think we are REALLY done here
[09:24:20] <DaveMethvin> we just need mikesherov to appear
[09:24:24] <jaubourg> k, gotta fly
[09:24:27] <DaveMethvin> bye guys
[09:24:48] <jaubourg> you didn't ping him :P
[09:25:10] <jaubourg> bbye
[09:25:31] <gibson042> bye
