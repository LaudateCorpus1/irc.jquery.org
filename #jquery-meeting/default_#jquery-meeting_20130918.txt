[09:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov rxaviers
[09:01:02] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:06] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:36] <tj_vantoll_phone> Hey
[09:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> I started the removal of "globals" in preparation for AMD.
[09:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/compare/globals
[09:02:35] <tj_vantoll_phone> :)
[09:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> After discussing with rxaviers yesterday, some of these may change to continue using "globals" with a widget-specific prefix for all variables/functions.
[09:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> But some will stay in the prototype.
[09:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> For a lot of cases, having things exposed is useful.
[09:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> We need to figure out what we're doing about tracking CSS dependencies.
[09:06:33] <rxaviers> yeap, for CSS dependencies are we looking for something like require.js plugins?
[09:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what we want to do.
[09:07:53] <rxaviers> ok
[09:09:18] <kborchers> sorry late but here
[09:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything new for download builder?
[09:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you're just waiting for the green light on AMD.
[09:11:33] <rxaviers> correct. In the meanwhile, Im working on Globalize CLDR
[09:11:56] <rxaviers> But, I dont have any updates this week, because I've switched my allocation to another work these days
[09:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> I finally had time to review selectmenu.
[09:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/commit/f416a66f59e628bc635e120a39927be0fef139d1
[09:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers also sent a PR to remove the need for anchors in menu items: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1081
[09:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't gotten a chance to look at that yet.
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> But that'll be a nice change.
[09:14:01] <kborchers> :)
[09:14:34] <tj_vanto_> Yeah that was a surprisingly clean change
[09:14:51] <kborchers> yeah, i was a bit shocked by it too ;)
[09:15:01] <kborchers> one issue is for navigation menus now
[09:15:26] <kborchers> users will have to do their own styles to make the entire menu-item navigable via an anchor
[09:15:36] <kborchers> just adding the anchor only links the text now
[09:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> Is that just a matter of .ui-menu-item a { display: block; } ?
[09:16:16] <kborchers> yeah i think so … i guess i could just add that back in
[09:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> No, let's keep that out.
[09:16:24] <kborchers> ok
[09:16:30] <kborchers> but easy enough for someone to do
[09:16:35] <kborchers> maybe we add a note to docs
[09:16:47] <petersendidit> Yes, notes because people will create mass tickets asking for it
[09:16:49] <fnagel> Haven't time to check kbochers PR too. Hopefully this night.
[09:16:51] <tj_vanto_> +1
[09:17:11] <tj_vanto_> For note on docs
[09:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> We probably need to fully investigate navigation menus.
[09:17:20] <kborchers> ok once merged i'll do doc updates
[09:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> The anchors should probably stay in the taxindex and use `role: null`
[09:18:22] <kborchers> hmm good point
[09:19:10] <fnagel> How to proceed with open selectmenu questions?
[09:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> I have a few that I need to look into.
[09:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> I should be able to get to that this week or next week.
[09:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> Right now I'm working on some docs updates with tj_vanto_
[09:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1a1d3T2S390J
[09:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> Documenting extension points (methods that are safe to override)
[09:22:15] <kborchers> yeah, i've been following that … looking really nice
[09:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vanto_ is working on the actual docs.
[09:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on the XSLT changes.
[09:22:49] <petersendidit> awesome
[09:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> This also gives us the ability to write custom examples for widget methods.
[09:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Which will also help with better documenting the widget factory.
[09:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to get the learn article about extending widgets published so that we can push these changes.
[09:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/427
[09:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll be reviewing that after this meeting.
[09:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> Once this is live, I'd like to wrap up https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/164
[09:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> Then back to selectmenu.
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> And then I'd like to have an API discussion for datepicker.
[09:26:47] <tj_vanto_> Sounds good
[09:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:27:18] <kborchers> nope
[09:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, for those who weren't there...
[09:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> We had a discussion with Kristofer from Topcoat (actually a few discussions).
[09:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's still not clear what themes will look like in the future, but we do have a lot of common goals.
[09:29:02] <scott_gonzalez> Kristofer is going to be in Amsterdam in a few weeks for PhoneGap Dev Days or something like that, so he'll be meeting up with uGoMobi to work through more details.
[09:31:26] <fnagel> Would be nice if in Amsterdam somebody could explain how it comes we think about using Topcoat
[09:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[09:33:05] <fnagel> I've missed the first step of the "new theme" discussion.
[09:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> We need a theme that works for UI and Mobile.
[09:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> But ideally it's just a generally useful theme, not tied to either project.
[09:36:41] <rxaviers> Im looking forward to seeing this topcoat and jquery ui progress. Improving our styles is a great thing
[09:38:14] <fnagel> Makes sense and see the need to improve UI CSS but I would like to know more about why exactly we choose topcoat
[09:38:31] <rxaviers> (ops: topcoat and  jquery ui + mobile progress :) )
[09:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> We chose Topcoat because they seemed like the most likely to be flexible enough to collaborate.
[09:41:00] <uGoMobi> as a next step I will look into what would be needed to make UI and Mobile widgets work with Topcoat
[09:41:29] <uGoMobi> i.e. if classes options is enough
[09:41:44] <uGoMobi> markup, etc.
[09:43:48] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: For sure. Its a young project so I guess they would love to have a giant like jQuery UI on their side.
[09:44:46] <uGoMobi> besides that Topcoat is willing to collaborate we also have the same ideas about structure of CSS framework and strong focus on performance
[09:46:00] <fnagel> uGoMobi: that sounds more reasonable to me than just the will to collaborate (which could change very quick)
