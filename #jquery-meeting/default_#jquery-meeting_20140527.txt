[01:00:06] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[01:00:39] <_|Nix|_> This is the weekly web-ui-fw meeting.
[01:00:41] <uGoMobi> hi all
[01:02:00] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi, Minkyeong, Hyunsook: Hi~ All.  and Kangsik is by me. ;)
[01:02:13] <_|Nix|_> Welcome!
[01:02:17] <_|Nix|_> How's it going?
[01:03:20] <Changsuk> Kangsik told me that he checked removement of check-box widget's style option.
[01:04:00] <_|Nix|_> Any major obstacles?
[01:04:07] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: and he is thinking that we don't need to remove check-box widget's style option.
[01:04:52] <_|Nix|_> How do you mean "we don't need to remove" the style options?
[01:05:33] <uGoMobi> just looked at the widget code and I think he is right
[01:05:42] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Because, check-box's mini option's default value is "false", so he didn't need to remove that.
[01:05:52] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/checkboxradio.js#L27
[01:06:10] <Changsuk> let me and Kangsik see....
[01:06:38] <Changsuk> Yes, right "mini: false,"
[01:06:42] <uGoMobi> theme and iconpos won't be removed, so it's only mini
[01:07:11] <_|Nix|_> Right, we need to remove nothing, but we do need to deprecate and update the demos and the API docs indicating that you must use the class ui-mini.
[01:07:21] <uGoMobi> so we only have to add a demo to show how to make it mini when the option is not there anymore in 1.6
[01:07:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[01:07:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, we need to update the existing demos that show a mini checkbox.
[01:07:51] <uGoMobi> yeah, we need to add deprecate note to the docs
[01:08:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[01:08:40] <uGoMobi> change them from data-mini to add the class
[01:09:03] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[01:09:15] <_|Nix|_> Well, that doesn't sound like it should be too much trouble.
[01:09:41] <uGoMobi> and I will add info to the upgrade guide
[01:10:25] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: thank you~
[01:10:41] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[01:11:38] <_|Nix|_> OK. Sounds like we have a plan going forward. Do we need to discuss any other topics?
[01:12:11] <uGoMobi> is there a PR for the button widget in the API docs repo already?
[01:12:13] <Changsuk> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: And Kangsik will do a PR about removing style options in Button widget, and Can he create a branch on "api.jquerymobile"?
[01:12:28] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Yes.
[01:12:50] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: There needs to be an api.jquerymobile.com PR that corresponds to the button widget PR.
[01:12:52] <uGoMobi> yes, Kangsik should create a branch in his forked API docs repo
[01:12:57] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I'm sorry that I typed slow. because I'm talking with Kangsik.
[01:13:03] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[01:13:05] <uGoMobi> np
[01:13:21] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Ok, Thanks. He'll do that.
[01:14:07] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: and Kangsik will remove styles in Collapsable widget.
[01:14:08] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Look at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/307 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7372
[01:14:18] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Those are the two PRs for the table review.
[01:14:19] <uGoMobi> perfect!
[01:14:43] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Are those examples?
[01:14:46] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: The button also has to have two PRs - one on the repo (#7348[âœ“]) and one on the API docs.
[01:14:50] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Yes.
[01:14:55] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: That's how I'm handling the table review.
[01:15:04] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Thank you~~~!!
[01:15:10] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: NP.
[01:15:41] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Are those any issues to support you?
[01:15:56] <_|Nix|_> What do you mean?
[01:16:32] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I just asked you what Kangsik and my team will do. ;)
[01:16:55] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Well, if you can continue the style option removal, that'd be of great help!
[01:17:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[01:17:23] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Ok~ I see.
[01:17:53] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Kangsik and I told you all things.
[01:17:55] <uGoMobi> by the way - we need to open a ticket for the checkboxradio style options removal
[01:18:09] <_|Nix|_> Right - good point!
[01:18:13] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: yes
[01:18:16] <_|Nix|_> I can do that.
[01:18:24] <uGoMobi> great
[01:18:40] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: You're great guy~!
[01:18:44] <uGoMobi> even if we combine the work in one PR we still need separate tickets
[01:18:51] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: yes he is
[01:18:54] <uGoMobi> :)
[01:20:24] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: So... before Kangsik will do a PR about Collapsable widget, should he combine his codes with _|Nix|_'s codes?
[01:20:44] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: what code from _|Nix|_ do you mean?
[01:21:18] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7430
[01:21:25] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: you told us that we may combine the works.
[01:21:42] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Collapsible is fairly complicated because of the interaction with collapsibleset.
[01:22:23] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: yes, right. Kangsik knows that.
[01:23:13] <_|Nix|_> In case of collapsible, we're talking about inset(true), corners(true), and mini(false).
[01:23:20] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: So, anyway before he will do a PR about Collapsible, Kangsik or Hyunsook will give you an email with the codes.
[01:23:28] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[01:23:40] <uGoMobi> I don't think we should email code
[01:23:52] <uGoMobi> just create a PR
[01:24:11] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I guess code is a lot harder to read in an email.
[01:24:12] <uGoMobi> and we will review
[01:24:33] <Changsuk> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: Ok, Thank you~
[01:24:44] <uGoMobi> right, and other team members should be able to review as well
[01:25:01] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: ha ha, yes. I think so.
[01:27:16] <_|Nix|_> I'm really curious how much of the code from collapsible we'll be able to "translate" to CSS.
[01:27:59] <_|Nix|_> The reason I say "translate" is that we do a lot of the same things CSS does in terms of inheritance.
[01:28:30] <_|Nix|_> In collapsible we basically compute the option values from the old value, the new value, and the parent's value.
[01:29:01] <_|Nix|_> This is kinda like what CSS does when you have the various rules that apply and the computed value for a property.
[01:30:00] <_|Nix|_> ... and, just like CSS, we have rules like "if it's not inset, it cannot have corners, even if the corners option is true".
[01:31:03] <_|Nix|_> I'd love to see if we can do all this for collapsible and collapsibleSet with pure CSS.
[01:31:31] <_|Nix|_> ... but anyway - enough rambling on my part.
[01:32:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: shall we rebase the Button/Theme PR?
[01:32:26] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348
[01:32:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You mean pull it into a branch and rebase?
[01:33:08] <uGoMobi> ah right, the branch is not on our repo
[01:33:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nevermind
[01:33:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can still do it, and wait with the landing until the APi docs branch is ready.
[01:33:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can get arschmitz to review it.
[01:35:26] <uGoMobi> I just thought it would be easier to keep overview when we reduce it to 2 commits already (Theme: Added classes to negate styles & Button: Updated demos)
[01:35:32] <uGoMobi> or something like that
[01:36:20] <_|Nix|_> Well, we'll end up squashing things down anyway.
[01:36:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if we pull it in a branch we will need another PR for that
[01:36:35] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's true. I've done that before.
[01:36:56] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Can you and Kangsik perform the necessary changes?
[01:37:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I know, but if we going to add more widgets to that PR it can become a bit messy
[01:37:18] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that's right!
[01:37:29] <_|Nix|_> Then it's better if it stays in Kangsik's repo.
[01:37:36] <uGoMobi> yup
[01:38:53] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: the nessary changes? what does mean?
[01:39:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if collapsible also need to use the classes that are added to the theme CSS, it have to be in the same branch/PR as well
[01:39:37] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk, Kangsik: You'd need to rebase onto master, squash the commits into two: One that modifies css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css and the other that modifies the demos, and make sure the author is set to Kangsik's real name, and that the commit messages do not end in "."
[01:40:07] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Kangsik understood and will reply your words. :)
[01:40:35] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[01:41:15] <uGoMobi> great
[01:41:24] <uGoMobi> see also my comment at the PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348#issuecomment-43684400
[01:42:03] <uGoMobi> by the way - I just changed the title of the PR (and the ticket for Button) because we are not removing style options yet, but deprecating them
[01:42:39] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's a good point. Removal comes in 1.6.0.
[01:42:49] <_|Nix|_> ... or later.
[01:43:36] <Kangsik> uGoMobi: Could you recommend a proper title?
[01:43:45] <uGoMobi> sure
[01:45:07] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: you mean for the commit message or for the tickets and PR?
[01:45:51] <uGoMobi> for tickets and PR just use name of the component and "deprecate style options"
[01:46:20] <Kangsik> uGoMobi: My word is 'Could you let me know a proper title?'
[01:46:57] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: title for what?
[01:47:04] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: not sure I understand
[01:47:28] <Kangsik> uGoMobi: ' PR'
[01:48:01] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: I already changed it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348
[01:48:08] <uGoMobi> to Deprecate style options
[01:48:26] <Kangsik> uGoMobi: Oh. Thank you.
[01:48:40] <uGoMobi> I didn't use the name of a component because we combine theme + button + checkboxradio
[01:50:40] <Kangsik> uGoMobi: Yes. I understand your words.
[01:50:52] <uGoMobi> ok great
[01:50:59] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss
[01:50:59] <uGoMobi> ?
[01:51:38] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: I've commented on your API docs PR.
[01:51:42] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Just a few minor things.
[01:51:46] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Good work!
[01:51:59] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Yep.. Thank you.
[01:52:27] <Kangsik> I will check it.
[01:52:41] <_|Nix|_> I guess that's it for this week, right, folks?
[01:52:53] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:52:58] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[01:54:00] <Kangsik> I told you every things.
[01:54:28] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk, Kangsik, uGoMobi, Hyunsook, Minkyeong: Have a good, productive week, followed by a relaxing weekend!
[01:55:08] <uGoMobi> bye all, have a good week!
[01:56:31] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_, @uGoMobi : bye all. :-) have a good day!
