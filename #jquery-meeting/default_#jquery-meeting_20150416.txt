[09:00:32] <arthurvr> hey
[09:00:36] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately, I got strep throat this weekend and spent most of this week laying in bed.
[09:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> So I didn't get anything done.
[09:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'll work on getting the release ready for early next week. Monday seems likely.
[09:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that we have anything to really discuss since we didn't get that done this week.
[09:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> Unless someone has something to discuss, I think we'll just end/cancel the meeting.
[09:04:04] <snover> ok
[09:04:09] <snover> sorry about the strep
[09:04:13] <snover> hope you are feeling better!
[09:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm definitely getting there. I'm actually able to eat food and do things now :-)
[09:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> I had no idea strep could be so bad.
[09:06:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: iv never had it
[09:06:57] <arschmitz> but i hear nothing but bad things
[09:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this was the first time I've had it.
[09:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully the last, too.
[09:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, thanks for showing up. I'll work on the release.
[09:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> See you in #pep.

[11:04:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:04:31] <agcolom> hey
[11:04:40] <arschmitz> So button got another round of updates in ui
[11:04:46] <arschmitz> so ill be pulling those in later today
[11:05:36] <arschmitz> nothing changing as far as api
[11:05:41] <arschmitz> but a lot of small changes
[11:06:08] <arschmitz> jaspers css updates are on 1.5-dev
[11:06:26] <arschmitz> the new umd boilerplate is on 1.5-dev
[11:07:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: is working on getting ui builder running on 1.5-dev
[11:07:12] <arschmitz> i blew up our PR count this morning
[11:07:18] <arschmitz> with esformatter pr's
[11:07:27] <kapil21051> hey all
[11:07:32] <arschmitz> more coming cor cssComb
[11:07:59] <arschmitz> and if i can get one issue with collapsible set figured out auto init too
[11:08:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: might look for your help there since you know that weirdness best
[11:08:43] <gabriel_schulhof> I do bear that cross, yes :/
[11:09:02] <arschmitz> something with nested ones is not working correctly
[11:10:29] <gabriel_schulhof> OK ... let's have a look after the meeting ...
[11:10:39] <gabriel_schulhof> ... if that suits your schedule ...
[11:11:06] <arschmitz> sure
[11:12:19] <kapil21051> gabriel_schullof : also i need to discuss with you about  that popup issue
[11:12:29] <arschmitz> ok navigation
[11:12:45] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: and i have been talking about nav on and off for a few months
[11:12:56] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: OK.
[11:13:05] <arschmitz> and we are getting close to starting some real work on nav
[11:13:29] <arschmitz> incorperating some of what ianmaffett has done with multiple containers on intel appFramework into jqm
[11:13:42] <arschmitz> and we at the same time want to clean up all the old cruft in nav
[11:14:01] <gabriel_schulhof> An emphatic :+1: from me ...
[11:14:20] <arschmitz> We had a call this morning and it seems like everyone is on the same page for where to go with nav
[11:14:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ianmaffett reviewed the various nav wikis with your thoughts on everything as well
[11:14:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, some of that stuff is outdated.
[11:15:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I think the concepts are central though - reachable vs. non-reachable, mainly.
[11:15:09] <ianmaffett> It's got good information though
[11:15:47] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and there's that fundamental conundrum you pointed out with rendering history in a linear fashion.
[11:15:56] <arschmitz> so i think 1.6 is where we will try to start really digging into nav
[11:16:02] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and the decision as to whether to Ajax on startup ...
[11:16:13] <arschmitz> probably start with a bunch of deprecation and clean up of whats there
[11:16:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... that'll give us good leeway ...
[11:16:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Sometimes I feel like we should just yank everything we have and write it from scratch, while peeking frequently at what we've yanked.
[11:17:00] <arschmitz> what we talked about this morning is trying to time things right to use 2.0 as a clean break for nav
[11:17:30] <arschmitz> then we can worry less about backcompat
[11:18:05] <gabriel_schulhof> I wonder how much code out there actually depends on our quirks, like dialogHashKey ...
[11:18:21] <arschmitz> no way to know
[11:18:40] <arschmitz> all we can do is try to make the best nav system we can moving forward
[11:18:45] <arschmitz> that has a clean and sane api
[11:18:57] <ianmaffett> @arschmitz -well, I'm out then ;)
[11:18:57] <arschmitz> and make it possible to addres more specific cases with extensions
[11:19:09] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: sane just too much to ask?
[11:19:32] <ianmaffett> Haha.  It will be good to be writing code with others.  I cannot do clean and sane.
[11:20:21] <gabriel_schulhof> You know, we should probably switch to intern before we do a lot of this ...
[11:20:25] <arschmitz> So im excited to get nav work going again
[11:20:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well hopefully apsdehal will be starting that soon
[11:20:43] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because I'd want the new code to be tested on as many browsers as possible ...
[11:21:00] <arschmitz> i know he has been talking to snover about getting the qunit interface polished and onto master
[11:21:09] <arschmitz> apsdehal: any progress there?
[11:21:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Things like initial popstate on Webkit ... *shudder*
[11:21:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well it will give us a chance to re think how we handle a lot of this
[11:21:58] <arschmitz> maybe clean it up
[11:22:32] <arschmitz> so related to tests
[11:22:44] <arschmitz> it seems like since we upgraded qunit things have become much less stable
[11:23:04] <arschmitz> hard to say if this is related or not but he have random time outs a lot
[11:23:08] <arschmitz> and its not on nav
[11:23:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think with the latest round of issues fixed for iOS, I was finally able to properly handle the initial popstate. So, while the code can serve as a lessons-learned-type reference, it definitely needs cleaning up.
[11:23:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh speaking of iOS bugs
[11:23:47] <arschmitz> we got several reports that iOS 8 bug with selects crashing the browser was fixed
[11:23:54] <arschmitz> but i have not personally confirmed
[11:23:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah I saw that!
[11:24:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Yaaay for Apple :/
[11:25:39] <gabriel_schulhof> They still have issues with multiple selects ... that's another issue I filed.
[11:25:47] <arschmitz> jasper is still waiting on my bio for team page
[11:25:50] <arschmitz> because im terrible
[11:26:01] <gabriel_schulhof> There. Bio submitted. :)
[11:26:36] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: You can use that for arschmitz's bio :)
[11:26:44] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:26:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Reminds me of "Mostly harmless."
[11:28:28] <arschmitz> cgack: looks like toolbar is waiting on a rebase still?
[11:29:01] <cgack> @arschmitz i had done one before i assigned it to you. however after being away for a while there is a chance it could use another
[11:29:07] <cgack> i'll take a look and try for it
[11:29:17] <arschmitz> sure
[11:29:41] <arschmitz> seems like thats it for today
[11:29:46] <arschmitz> any one have anything else?
[11:30:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Not I.
[11:30:34] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back in -dev then
[11:30:38] <arthurvr> bye
[11:30:38] <gabriel_schulhof> K L8R
