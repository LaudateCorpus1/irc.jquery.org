[14:01:17] <sfrisk> kristjy, geekman-rohit
[14:04:43] <sfrisk> kristyjy*
[14:04:52] <kristyjy> hello
[14:05:37] <sfrisk> hey, might just be the two of us
[14:06:56] <kristyjy> bummer
[14:07:43] <sfrisk> Trying to see if I can get ahold of geekman-rohit, but he might have gone to sleep
[14:08:00] <sfrisk> did you get to play with postcss at all?
[14:08:54] <kristyjy> I didn't. After our discussions on Sunday though I'm solidly on board
[14:11:34] <sfrisk> okay
[14:11:43] <sfrisk> Wanted to get geekman-rohit's weigh in too
[14:12:00] <sfrisk> if you're around Thursday at 2, I figured we could go to the jquery-mobile meeting
[14:12:20] <kristyjy> my calendar is open currently
[14:13:03] <sfrisk> Okay
[14:13:16] <sfrisk> I'll ping geekman-rohit and let him know
[14:13:32] <sfrisk> In the meantime, I'll get a branch up and running using post-css with some examples
