[12:02:58] <jzaefferer> hey! I'm probably disappear again in a minute :/
[12:03:09] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:21] <fnagel> hi
[12:03:49] <fnagel> waiting for a client call too, sorry
[12:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> I landed the fix for the Vader theme.
[12:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/340
[12:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> Haven't heard anything good or bad since then.
[12:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> I looked into the resizable bug with changing handles: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15084
[12:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> I kept running into issues trying to work on it.
[12:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> So I asked the Konstantin Dinev (the person who implemented the ability to change handles) to look into it.
[12:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> They said they'd work on a fix.
[12:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> Both of us are confused about how this is a regression though.
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> Because the functionality that Konstantin implemented was adding `setOption()` to support changing handles.
[12:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> But the regression is that changing handles used to work and now doesn't when using the built-in handles.
[12:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't make sense that changing handles used to work without `setOption()` existing.
[12:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> There was a bug for spinner stealing focus when scrolling with the mousewheel: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15139
[12:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> I already landed a fix for it.
[12:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Update on the button compatibility issue?
[12:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15109
[12:11:35] <arschmitz> was a little more to fixing it then i thought to maintain the right return value but i should have a pr up shortly been working on it this morning
[12:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> We can release as soon as that's fixed.
[12:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> The next big thing that we need to fix is the memory leaks with the event and classes tracking.
[12:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a few tickets for it.
[12:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:15:15] <fnagel> nothing for calendar
[12:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
