[12:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> Awww...no b-ot
[12:01:06] <bethge> :(
[12:01:09] <bethge> Hi :)
[12:01:14] <scott_gonzalez> hey bethge
[12:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer
[12:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure everyone saw that I opened new issues for chunks of functional tests.
[12:02:28] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately, I wasn't able to work on any of those this week.
[12:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working very long days and just haven't had any time.
[12:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully next week will go back to normal and I'll have time to work on tests.
[12:03:59] <bethge> No worries, similar here tbh
[12:04:44] <bethge> I got my chromedriver issue resolved. Downloaded a fresh version of the binary
[12:04:58] <arschmitz> on that i updated pr
[12:05:04] <arschmitz> so that should work for you now
[12:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, good to know it was just an old binary issue.
[12:06:04] <bethge> arschmitz: cool, I will check it out
[12:06:21] <arschmitz> i had to add an npm shrinkwrap file to fix which is ugly
[12:06:39] <arschmitz> was an issue with too loose a dependency declaration
[12:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's anything else that was going on in the past week.
[12:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Do either of you have anything else to discuss?
[12:08:58] <bethge> We got something resolved over at  https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/33
[12:09:16] <bethge> Which started here:  https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/267
[12:09:56] <bethge> In short: a pointermove, that is not triggered by a chorded button interaction, will have button = -1
[12:10:49] <bethge> Microsoft, already has it that way, FF will have to adapt and we would either create a new issue for it or as steditor to update his pull request
[12:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh right, that was actually a fairly involved discussion. Not sure how I forgot to add that to the agenda.
[12:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: Do you think the agenda notes fully cover this topic?
[12:20:32] <bethge> sure :)
[12:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> great
[12:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, despite our seemingly slow progress (we have very sporadic commits), I think we're doing a wonderful job.
[12:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> The fact that we've been the catalyst for spec changes, upstream test improvements, and browser implementation changes is amazing.
[12:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> This is some of the most important work.
[12:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Evangelism and getting everyone to switch to pointer events is the other important work.
[12:23:11] <arschmitz> +1
[12:23:17] <bethge> Appreciate you saying that
[12:27:07] <bethge> Should I go ahead and try my luck at merging https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/267 ? Do you prefer doing that scott_gonzalez (would not mind if you did)? Or should I ask him to update according to the spec?
[12:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> The proper fix would be to set it based on changes in `buttons`, right?
[12:31:21] <bethge> I believe It would basically be always -1 except for mousedown and mouseup. The PR aligns with FF's current implementation, which mirriors `buttons`
[12:31:48] <bethge> ( steditors PR)
[12:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> Let's get the PR updated based on the discussion.
[12:31:57] <bethge> ok great
[12:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it for today.
[12:38:23] <bethge> I think so, thanks for the "pep talk" ;-D
[12:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[14:02:43] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: agcolom: gabrielschulhof: cgack: cogwurx: meeting time
[14:02:47] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:02:55] <cgack> howdy!
[14:03:20] <arschmitz> want to apologize up front im double booked
[14:03:32] <cogwurx> Hello
[14:03:36] <cogwurx> no worries
[14:03:38] <gabrielschulhof> NP.
[14:04:04] <arschmitz> ill do my best to pay attention but if some one else could update the agenda and kinda drive it would be a big help
[14:05:32] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ... I only have the link for the 2015 agenda.
[14:05:50] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz, jasperdegroot: D'you guys have the link to this year's agenda?
[14:06:02] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: let me look
[14:06:24] <jasperdegroot> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=1983914725
[14:06:32] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: ^
[14:06:55] <gabrielschulhof> Thanks!
[14:07:28] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, I don't have edit access.
[14:07:32] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Do you?
[14:07:51] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: arschmitz is in another meeting, so he's asked us to move the meeting forward.
[14:08:04] <arschmitz> just a sec ill fix
[14:08:09] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: ok
[14:08:34] <arschmitz> should be good
[14:08:40] <gabrielschulhof> Thansk!
[14:09:32] <gabrielschulhof> OK, I've duplicated the sheet ... lessee ...
[14:10:00] <gabrielschulhof> So, for selectmenu, I've gotten around to all of arschmitz' review comments.
[14:10:15] <gabrielschulhof> The only thing that's missing is a test to make sure the UI reset extension works.
[14:10:24] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:10:33] <gabrielschulhof> ... and the deprecated page events are gone from both selectmenu and page.
[14:10:41] <arschmitz> WOO!!
[14:10:50] <gabrielschulhof> ... build still failing on travis though, even though it's good locally.
[14:11:18] <jasperdegroot> shouldn't we ping the other team members?
[14:11:24] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: They're here.
[14:11:32] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: arschmitz pinged them before you joined.
[14:11:43] <arschmitz> indeed
[14:11:47] <jasperdegroot> ah ok, sorry
[14:11:52] <gabrielschulhof> At least cogwurx and cgack.
[14:11:53] <jasperdegroot> was disconnected
[14:11:56] <gabrielschulhof> NP.
[14:11:57] <jasperdegroot> hi all :)
[14:12:00] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[14:12:13] <jasperdegroot> go on with the good news about selectmenu
[14:12:30] <gabrielschulhof> So, I still need to go through the selectmenu tests and remove all the deprecated stuff, then add tests for the deprecated stuff ;)
[14:14:08] <gabrielschulhof> Otherwise it's good for another round of review.
[14:14:17] <gabrielschulhof> How's table doing?
[14:14:46] <cgack> I hit up arschmitz review comments and pushed
[14:14:56] <cgack> tests still fail intermittently on travis, but not local
[14:14:59] <arschmitz> woo!
[14:15:21] <cgack> i might need help with the backcompat on table since I didn't do all the rewrite work
[14:15:41] <cgack> but hoping to address backcompat this week
[14:15:48] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: OK. I'll be around.
[14:16:09] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: super, I'll ping you if I need you
[14:16:51] <gabrielschulhof> So, we've got panel. Not sure if apsdehal1 is around ...
[14:17:14] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: How's panel doing?
[14:17:26] <arschmitz> good mostly finished
[14:17:32] <arschmitz> just finishing going through the tests
[14:18:40] <jasperdegroot> broken tests is also still an issue for the demos updates https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8332
[14:19:15] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so we need to look at 1.5-dev to fix those, right?
[14:19:28] <jasperdegroot> other than that I should be able to get demos in decent shape for beta before end of the month
[14:19:50] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: it's broken in the 1.5-demos-issues branch, not in 1.5-dev
[14:19:59] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, OK.
[14:20:11] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz and I looked into but couldn't figure out what the problem is
[14:20:26] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll try to have a look.
[14:20:49] <jasperdegroot> cogwurx: maybe you can help with some remaining work that needs to be done for the demos
[14:21:06] <cogwurx> was going to ask you if you need anything
[14:21:07] <jasperdegroot> cogwurx: probably best if I come up with something specific
[14:21:13] <cogwurx> that would be good
[14:21:24] <jasperdegroot> cogwurx: I will do that in a comment on the ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8245
[14:21:38] <cogwurx> sounds good
[14:21:44] <jasperdegroot> great, thanks!
[14:21:48] <cogwurx> no prob
[14:22:22] <gabrielschulhof> Do we have anything else?
[14:22:51] <jasperdegroot> not really something to discuss now but there are a few other tickets we have to look at before beta
[14:23:09] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Wanna put a list in the agenda?
[14:23:16] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Priority%3A+Blocker%22+milestone%3A1.5.0
[14:23:31] <gabrielschulhof> Much better :)
[14:23:55] <gabrielschulhof> *whew* ...
[14:24:30] <jasperdegroot> looks like we are talking about 5 or 6 tickets
[14:24:42] <jasperdegroot> the others are selectmenu, table, and classes tickets
[14:24:55] <jasperdegroot> and panel tickets I mean
[14:25:15] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Another thing to look at for next week.
[14:25:37] <gabrielschulhof> Ummm ... do I, like, add that to the agenda?
[14:25:53] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, they're marked as blockers :)
[14:26:22] <jasperdegroot> I added the link to the tickets
[14:26:28] <gabrielschulhof> Cool!
[14:27:00] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so, I guess we're good, right?
[14:27:32] <cgack> I'm good
[14:27:51] <jasperdegroot> think so
[14:27:53] <jasperdegroot> me too
[14:28:00] <cogwurx> I'm good
[14:28:03] <cogwurx> I think
[14:28:16] <gabrielschulhof> To the -dev cave!
[14:28:21] <gabrielschulhof> L8R all! :)
[14:28:40] <cogwurx> have a good week!
[14:28:43] <jasperdegroot> later all
