[12:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> ahhh
[12:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz bethge
[12:00:41] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:52] <scott_gonzalez> PEP v0.4.2 was released this morning!
[12:01:57] <arschmitz> yay
[12:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing left is updating gh-pages and doing an announcement.
[12:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get to that right after the meeting.
[12:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> The PR to force pressure to be 0 for pointerup was merged
[12:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/313
[12:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> And Google was added to the authors list after all.
[12:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> One of Google's lawyers contacting me asking that it be added.
[12:06:43] <arschmitz> fun
[12:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a few issues that were filed recently (before the last meeting) to work through.
[12:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't have anything specific to discuss today other than the release.
[12:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:12:46] <arschmitz> we need an mit badge like this https://github.com/tildeio/glimmer
[12:12:57] <arschmitz> shows mit right in the top bar
[12:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that's easy.
[12:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually, probably not easy.
[12:15:08] <arschmitz> how do you do it? seems like only repos where i added the license through github show it?
[12:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> I think the problem is that our license file has lots of info in it.
[12:15:43] <arschmitz> ui and mobile dont show it either
[12:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we'll be able to get the MIT badge without ripping everything out.
[12:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> It's auto-detected based on the license file.
[12:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> And 50% of our license is not MIT text.
[12:16:19] <arschmitz> oh
[12:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/benbalter/licensee
[12:18:42] <arschmitz> So the CC0 license in all the jquery stuff is messing it up
[12:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/benbalter/licensee/blob/master/docs/what-we-look-at.md#why-not-just-look-at-the-license-field-of-insert-package-manager-here
[12:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> And the note about externals.
[12:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's literally just that we have not insignificant differences from standalone MIT license text.
[12:19:57] <arschmitz> yeah the CC0 part pretty much im sure
[12:20:08] <arschmitz> it would detect 2 license in the file
[12:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> It won't detect any.
[12:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> It does a text compare against known license text.
[12:20:53] <arschmitz> it says regular expression
[12:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> regex is only for finding file names to check against.
[12:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[12:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today. Thanks everyone.
[14:09:10] <arschmitz> Hi all sorry i got double booked
[14:09:22] <agcolom> hi
[14:09:22] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:09:30] <arschmitz> apsdehal__: gabrielschulhof: sfrisk_: agcolom cgack: cogwurx
[14:09:30] <apsdehal__> Hi
[14:09:34] <sfrisk_> yo
[14:09:41] <agcolom> I was wondering if US had switched to winter time ;-)
[14:09:55] <sfrisk_> I have no idea when we switch
[14:09:55] <cgack> howdy
[14:10:03] <sfrisk_> I mostly depend on my phone switching everything over for me
[14:10:07] <arschmitz> My update is that i did a couple reviews and finished the changelog
[14:10:10] <sfrisk_> which might be a dangerous way to live
[14:10:47] <agcolom> I can review the changelog tomorrow
[14:10:54] <cogwurx> hello
[14:11:01] <apsdehal__> I have opened PR's for all three issues we talked about last week
[14:11:11] <arschmitz> apsdehal__: great ill review those
[14:11:12] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=2121311965
[14:11:43] <cogwurx> @agcolom: changing time in November...
[14:12:01] <agcolom> ha, thanks :-)
[14:12:20] <cogwurx> no problem...not looking forward to it
[14:19:08] <agcolom> I added an issue... We need to ensure our docs and demos use CC0 images
[14:19:40] <agcolom> We have a few for the popup demos...
[14:20:42] <agcolom> I remember taking the kansas ones from a CC0 image site, but I cannot find that these are guaranteed CC0. We have a few others as well that we should checkk.
[14:21:14] <agcolom> If we cannot find that they are, then we should replace them and keep the trace that they are CC0
[14:22:16] <agcolom> other CC might be OK, but we need to ensure proper attribution
[14:49:05] <agcolom> everyone seems to have disappeared?
[14:49:06] <agcolom> apsdehal__: gabrielschulhof: sfrisk_: agcolom cgack: cogwurx
[14:49:16] <sfrisk_> hello?
[14:49:20] <apsdehal__> I am here
[14:49:24] <sfrisk_> sorry been wrapped up in a bug issue at work
[14:49:32] <cgack> I'm still lurking. just busy with {{ day job }}
[14:49:33] <cogwurx> hello
[14:49:44] <cogwurx> same here...
[14:49:46] <agcolom> no worries... I just thought everyone had disappeared
[14:50:04] <agcolom> wondering whether we should call it a day...
[14:50:18] <apsdehal__> Yes if no one else has anything
[14:50:23] <agcolom> looks like arschmitz is busy too
[14:50:32] <gabrielschulhof> I have a demo about dialog handling ...
[14:50:52] <gabrielschulhof> I made a PR. It's pretty rudimentary, but if you wanna check it out and opine about it.
[14:51:07] <gabrielschulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8524
[14:51:33] <gabrielschulhof> Other than that, I'm good with calling it a day.
[14:51:58] <agcolom> ok. gabrielschulhof I'll add something in the notes
[14:52:04] <gabrielschulhof> agcolom: Thanks!
[14:53:46] <agcolom> I'll check if I can find the origin of the images that we're using in our popup demos
[14:54:02] <agcolom> We'll need to change them if I can't trace back to CC0
[14:54:13] <gabrielschulhof> Cool! Thanks!
[14:54:40] <agcolom> ok. cool. So I guess we're done for today!
[14:55:22] <agcolom> Thanks everyone. I'll review the changelog also. Everyone please feel free to double check as well, as I guess that will get read a lot! ;-)
[14:55:33] <agcolom> best to get it right :-)
[14:56:01] <agcolom> see you all next week!
