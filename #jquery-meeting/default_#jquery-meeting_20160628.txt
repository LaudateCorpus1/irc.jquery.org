[13:59:52] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:00:03] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, kristjy, asrchmitz, nashvail
[14:00:05] <nashvail> hello!
[14:00:12] <geekman-rohit> hey everyone
[14:02:08] <sfrisk> Agenda of agendaness: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:02:15] <kristyjy> hellow
[14:02:18] <kristyjy> *hello
[14:02:59] <sfrisk> most of the focus for today is going to be on inputs and looking at that
[14:03:08] <sfrisk> now that it's up on views
[14:03:27] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/input-styling/demos/inputs.html
[14:06:15] <sfrisk> I'm not sure if they quite match the current visual feel of components thus far
[14:06:20] <geekman-rohit> I agree
[14:06:26] <kristyjy> I agree as well
[14:06:53] <nashvail> me too
[14:06:56] <geekman-rohit> nashvail alternative designs seem to be required
[14:07:36] <nashvail> sure I think giving feedbacks on just the design would be great before starting to write any code
[14:07:49] <nashvail> I think we have it up in an issue but it has no comments at all
[14:08:13] <sfrisk> I think having the input sizes matching up with button sizes would help
[14:08:24] <sfrisk> the small size is kinda close to the "medium" button size
[14:08:51] <nashvail> ok noted
[14:09:11] <kristyjy> makes sense. I also was thinking it might be helpful to allow the labels for checkboxes to be styled as a list of items as well as being inline like they are now
[14:09:25] <kristyjy> like how the radio buttons are styled
[14:10:18] <sfrisk> although radio buttons are done with empty divs
[14:10:32] <sfrisk> I think having a class for that lined up view that allows for "list" elements would be useful
[14:10:42] <sfrisk> I need to double check semantics though for a11y
[14:11:23] <nashvail> sorry I am not quite getting what you mean by "styled as a list of items"
[14:11:49] <nashvail> is it non-inline labels?
[14:12:34] <sfrisk> so your radio buttons are basically an unordered list of options
[14:12:49] <sfrisk> your markup for radios uses unclassed divs to make them on seperate lines
[14:13:02] <sfrisk> while checkboxes are all on one line together, which does look a bit confusing
[14:13:19] <sfrisk> we're talking about having the inline/not inline options for radio/checkboxes
[14:13:44] <sfrisk> and I think that the new line dividers should be classed base, rather than an empty div
[14:14:15] <nashvail> okay yes right, I just wrapped them around divs to make each of them take a new line
[14:14:47] <sfrisk> yeah, I think we shouldn't have non classed divs
[14:14:51] <sfrisk> <p> maybe
[14:14:53] <sfrisk> but not divs
[14:15:19] <nashvail> ok. So we don't need a class for inline/non-inline do we?
[14:15:26] <nashvail> for radio buttons and checkboxes?
[14:15:32] <kristyjy> maybe just make it an unordered list? We could have a class for it to ensure it looks good with the radio buttons / check boxes
[14:15:58] <sfrisk> I'm saying that the method you use to make the radio buttons non-inline should have a separator that isn't a div
[14:16:04] <sfrisk> so a specific form list class or something
[14:16:17] <sfrisk> spacing between them that is less than un associated inputs
[14:16:35] <sfrisk> also the labels for "child labels" is larger than "parent labels"
[14:16:53] <sfrisk> basically meaning radio button's label is much larger than the regular input labels
[14:17:16] <sfrisk> also you should have a fieldset label for checkboxes and radios
[14:17:34] <sfrisk> that indicate what they're about
[14:18:10] <nashvail> alright
[14:18:40] <nashvail> the way radios and checkboxes are implemented is fine?
[14:18:52] <nashvail> The checkbox tick behaves wierd on mobile, have to fix that
[14:20:17] <sfrisk> I have some notes that I put in the PR
[14:21:16] <sfrisk> also stylistically I don't think the radio buttons really match what we currently have for elements
[14:21:26] <sfrisk> you need a fieldset + legend for the checkbox and radio groups
[14:21:46] <sfrisk> and the labels for radio buttons are much larger than the label for the other inputs
[14:22:05] <geekman-rohit> I dont think we should implement the actual check uncheck
[14:22:05] <sfrisk> which looks awkward if you assume everything is part of the same form
[14:22:13] <geekman-rohit> or should we?
[14:22:20] <geekman-rohit> I think we should leave that to the js
[14:22:29] <geekman-rohit> some frameworks may handle it with js
[14:23:55] <nashvail> So far we just have buttons right? So I need to match the inputs aesthetics to that of the buttons so they look part of the same thing
[14:24:32] <sfrisk> we have the typography stuff too
[14:25:19] <sfrisk> I will say, I do like the look of your disabled inputs
[14:26:41] <sfrisk> also you can't navigate radio/checkboxes with keyboard only
[14:26:44] <sfrisk> and know where you are
[14:28:56] <nashvail> hmmm right
[14:29:21] <geekman-rohit> nashvail a checked class?
[14:29:43] <geekman-rohit> along with the way you style :checked
[14:30:16] <geekman-rohit> to make it easier for js frameworks who hide checkbox totally
[14:30:26] <nashvail> yes, missed that. Is there way I can download this chat?
[14:30:39] <geekman-rohit> you can from the logs
[14:30:43] <geekman-rohit> save the webpage
[14:31:02] <geekman-rohit> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20160628.log.html
[14:31:04] <geekman-rohit> bookmark that
[14:31:22] <nashvail> this is great!
[14:32:01] <geekman-rohit> yeah if you ever miss a meeting you can go ti irc.jquery.org
[14:32:03] <sfrisk> that reminds me, we have an issue to add a note for that
[14:32:05] <geekman-rohit> andread the logs
[14:33:21] <nashvail> So first task is to come up with better alternate design that matches buttons and typography we have so far
[14:33:53] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:33:55] <nashvail> I'll create a pen this time as well
[14:34:05] <sfrisk> I've added some of the notes we brought up on the issue
[14:34:28] <nashvail> thanks for doing that
[14:34:56] <nashvail> Also what does this mean? "Regarding the sizes, perhaps use maps so that users can add additional sizes just by adding entries to the maps?"
[14:35:14] <nashvail> cvrebert mentioned this
[14:35:55] <sfrisk> could ask him
[14:36:21] <sfrisk> might be similar to what was buttons did. each size was a map of a few different variables
[14:36:42] <sfrisk> might be some stuff in the buttons size maps we could make universal
[14:37:30] <nashvail> that might prove useful I think
[14:38:15] <sfrisk> 	"md": {
[14:38:15] <sfrisk> 		name: "Medium Sized Button",
[14:38:15] <sfrisk> 		value: {
[14:38:17] <sfrisk> 			"border-radius": "2px",
[14:38:19] <sfrisk> 			"font-size": "14px",
[14:38:21] <sfrisk> 			"line-height": "14px",
[14:38:23] <sfrisk> 			"padding": ".5em 1em"
[14:38:25] <sfrisk> 		}
[14:38:27] <sfrisk> 	},
[14:38:31] <sfrisk> all of those items would line up with what you would need for different sized inputs
[14:38:52] <nashvail> alright got it
[14:38:56] <sfrisk> we we could adjust to having a universal "size" map
[14:38:57] <sfrisk> s
[14:41:57] <nashvail> Dangit I forgot the comment there
[14:41:58] <nashvail> so sorry
[14:42:00] <sfrisk> okay so this week focus on the radio/checkboxes
[14:42:15] <sfrisk> the radiohead one?
[14:42:18] <nashvail> yeah
[14:42:24] <sfrisk> pretty funny, buuuuuut try to stay professional in comments :-)
[14:42:34] <sfrisk> the goal is to make it look like one person wrote all the comments
[14:42:39] <sfrisk> and that person was really a robot
[14:42:59] <nashvail> yeah
[14:43:10] <nashvail> that wasn't supposed to be there LOL my bad
[14:44:04] <nashvail> I'll update everyone with new designs as soon as possible
[14:44:17] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:44:23] <sfrisk> once you do, ping me and I'll update views
[14:44:51] <nashvail> how about I update the UI guide and then begin to code once everyone is happy with that design?
[14:45:16] <nashvail> I will also add links to pens
[14:45:21] <sfrisk> that works
[14:45:26] <nashvail> great
[14:49:47] <sfrisk> okay, anything else?
[14:49:54] <sfrisk> I'll try to add some more stuff after the meeting too
[14:50:08] <sfrisk> and @kristyjy those final changes for tables by next week?
[14:50:30] <kristyjy> okay!
[14:50:44] <sfrisk> okay, then on that note if no one else has anything
[14:50:51] <sfrisk> I'll wrap up this meeting
[14:51:17] <nashvail> okay until next time.
