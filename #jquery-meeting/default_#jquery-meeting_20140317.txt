[09:01:17] <DaveMethvin> oic, disabled FALSE!
[09:01:32] <DaveMethvin> so, who's up for a meeting?
[09:01:57] <gibson042> I'm game :)
[09:02:19] <DaveMethvin> timmywil markelog jaubourg rwaldron gnarf mikesherov  and whoever i missed
[09:02:34] <timmywil> a MEETING?
[09:02:40] <DaveMethvin> FOR ME?
[09:02:45] <timmywil> MEET ME
[09:02:45] <DaveMethvin> you shouldn't have
[09:02:58] <timmywil> meat me?
[09:03:05] <DaveMethvin> now i get that ticket, i was thinking disabled true and then click
[09:03:41] <m_gol> present
[09:03:47] <m_gol> you missed me!
[09:03:54] <DaveMethvin> oh sorry m_gol
[09:03:59] <DaveMethvin> i really did miss you!
[09:04:01] <m_gol> I've missed one meeting and I get left out, ohh! :P
[09:04:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah you're not a cool kid now
[09:04:29] <DaveMethvin> so the list of bugs left for the .1s isn't very long now
[09:04:44] <DaveMethvin> can everyone get the stuff done next to their names?
[09:04:45] <m_gol> we have infra issues :/
[09:04:49] <DaveMethvin> by wednesday?
[09:04:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah i hope those get fixed
[09:05:08] <DaveMethvin> but it's a beta so in the worst case we can still release
[09:05:21] <DaveMethvin> we can test  manually
[09:05:25] <DaveMethvin> which usually works better
[09:05:47] <m_gol> see http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2681
[09:05:50] <timmywil> So, we've waited long enough right? Is everyone ready for a sane :hidden/:visible?
[09:06:00] <m_gol> those jobs worked when they were in the jQuery project
[09:06:03] <m_gol> and not jQuery weekly
[09:06:06] <m_gol> which suggests infra issue
[09:06:14] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:06:26] <m_gol> also, AJAX tests were timing out recently; now they work fine but the situation repeats quite often
[09:06:30] <m_gol> no idea why this time
[09:07:00] <DaveMethvin> prob a server issue
[09:07:08] <DaveMethvin> switching to karma is worth a try
[09:07:32] <timmywil> nix what I said. We'll wait til after 1.11.1/2.1.1
[09:07:47] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: a sane :hidden/:visible would probably be NO :hidden/:visible
[09:07:54] <DaveMethvin> but having consistency would be good
[09:08:18] <DaveMethvin> i've seen some pretty ugly perf issues caused by :visible forcing layouts
[09:09:18] <DaveMethvin> anybody think they'll have problems with their assigned tix?
[09:09:20] <timmywil> I suspect those can be avoided by using boundaries
[09:10:26] <DaveMethvin> let's take a quick look at the PRs
[09:10:45] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: should I clone the agenda entry?
[09:10:49] <m_gol> there is nothing for today
[09:11:03] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah thta would be great m_g
[09:11:05] <DaveMethvin> m_gol:
[09:11:29] <DaveMethvin> i'm having some strange issues today
[09:11:36] <DaveMethvin> probably need to reboot
[09:13:40] <timmywil> I'm not sure what we want to do with http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14038
[09:14:18] <m_gol> well, to be completely sane we'd have to use calc here
[09:14:30] <m_gol> to subtract px from em
[09:14:44] <m_gol> but we can't, so...
[09:15:03] <DaveMethvin> man i hate these things!
[09:15:04] <timmywil> we could convert to pixels
[09:15:49] <m_gol> timmywil: maybe you're right but I fear this is one of these things we'll be cursing about in a year :-)
[09:16:03] <m_gol> like "let's just append px where it makes sense"
[09:16:05] <timmywil> I'm cursing about it now ;)
[09:16:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:16:35] <DaveMethvin> honestly i think this IS a rat hole we will regret going down
[09:16:40] <m_gol> because then someone will change font-size on the parent and we'll have a report that we broke their layout
[09:16:49] <DaveMethvin> and then people will bitch that it's slow
[09:17:07] <DaveMethvin> and other problems will crop up
[09:17:21] <timmywil> can we punt to 2.2? This could be a big enough change to warrant more than a patch bump.
[09:17:28] <DaveMethvin> i think so
[09:17:29] <m_gol> definitely
[09:17:33] <gibson042> I'm totally in favor of thta
[09:17:35] <gibson042> *that
[09:17:49] <timmywil> done
[09:17:52] <m_gol> we can use calc once we drop IE8 (looking into the far future...)
[09:18:15] <DaveMethvin> i we can write up an apologia in a blog post for 2.2 and document that if you're using border-box you should set outerWidth
[09:18:55] <DaveMethvin> well basically timmywil's comment describes what people should do
[09:19:09] <DaveMethvin> it's just that people prefer mind reading
[09:19:47] <m_gol> yup
[09:20:29] <m_gol> can I land https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1529?
[09:20:51] <m_gol> I've been wondering about this test for a long time :-)
[09:21:02] <DaveMethvin> since we can't figure out why it was more complicated, why not?
[09:21:04] <m_gol> and I'd love to remove my jQuery.swap workaround in the test, it's fugly
[09:21:12] <DaveMethvin> then we can figure out when we find out what it broke
[09:21:15] <m_gol> haha
[09:21:27] <gibson042> +1 :D
[09:21:32] <m_gol> we shouldn't break any browser we test
[09:21:42] <m_gol> since they have proper values in support and we check that
[09:21:44] <DaveMethvin> it's the ones we DON'T test that are the problem :)
[09:22:06] <m_gol> ok, I'll land this then
[09:23:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042  did that fix to remove the "unknown attribute" that Windows apps needs look okay?
[09:23:10] <DaveMethvin> their patch was way too big originally
[09:23:18] <DaveMethvin> but just using a standard safe attr seems okay
[09:23:24] <timmywil> yea, I believe it's ok now
[09:23:39] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/253, right?
[09:23:52] <timmywil> yea
[09:23:53] <gibson042> LGTM
[09:24:01] <timmywil> I'll land
[09:24:03] <DaveMethvin> sorry should have posted the link
[09:24:36] <DaveMethvin> i've been trying to tag the PRs with a version now, but the reporting sucks unless issues are turned on
[09:24:47] <DaveMethvin> get with it GitHub!
[09:24:59] <gibson042> please confirm on IE8, though... "class" may be special enough to slip by
[09:25:20] <DaveMethvin> oh true
[09:25:30] <gibson042> if so, "title" will probably be OK
[09:25:36] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: can you ping sb at MS about testing Win8 apps? It's really important that it's possible, we'll be constantly breaking it otherwise
[09:25:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah i already did
[09:25:56] <DaveMethvin> all these envs where we can't test
[09:26:12] <DaveMethvin> i already told them that this will be their fate if they don't set up something to automate this
[09:26:17] <DaveMethvin> but it's in their court
[09:26:20] <DaveMethvin> hi mal``
[09:26:24] <DaveMethvin> markelog!
[09:26:25] <m_gol> k
[09:26:30] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:26:32] <m_gol> I have minor comments in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1531
[09:26:35] <m_gol> hi
[09:26:44] <markelog> sorry, i'm late
[09:26:51] <markelog> totally forgot about it (
[09:26:51] <DaveMethvin> np
[09:27:04] <DaveMethvin> markelog is the time zone different now?
[09:27:17] <markelog> pretty busy at this week
[09:27:21] <m_gol> yup, since last week ;)
[09:27:25] <DaveMethvin> you would think the world would have this stuff worked out by now!
[09:27:28] <markelog> just like at previous one
[09:27:34] <m_gol> Europe turns on the summer zone in 1,5 weeks
[09:27:36] <m_gol> * 1.5
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> yay then back to normal i guess
[09:28:06] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i will just edit that comment if the OP doesn't fix it before i land it
[09:28:09] <markelog> yeah, it is
[09:28:12] <m_gol> sure
[09:28:21] <markelog> did i miss something important?
[09:28:32] <DaveMethvin> no we just gave you all the work :)
[09:28:42] <markelog> ))
[09:28:59] <DaveMethvin> i think you have a couple of tix to deal with for the .1 release
[09:29:00] <m_gol> markelog: no, we're just rewriting jQuery in CoffeScript
[09:29:08] <markelog> oh shoot!
[09:29:10] <markelog> nooooooo
[09:29:51] <markelog> those two PR's right?
[09:29:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:30:13] <markelog> three if we count the Sizzle
[09:30:24] <timmywil> was there a jQuery ticket for the sizzle pull?
[09:30:26] <markelog> finally it happens )
[09:30:36] <markelog> i don't think so
[09:30:39] <markelog> i will create one
[09:30:49] <timmywil> meh, I'm not sure we need it
[09:30:50] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14818 ?
[09:31:01] <markelog> oh, right
[09:31:05] <markelog> i already did
[09:31:11] <timmywil> oh that one
[09:31:17] <timmywil> i meant the windows apps one
[09:31:18] <markelog> this month is crazy for me
[09:31:27] <markelog> so much to do
[09:31:42] <m_gol> markelog: how is the karma PR going? will you have time to finish it soon? is there much left to do?
[09:31:57] <markelog> no, i don't think so
[09:32:12] <m_gol> to which question did you answer? :-)
[09:32:14] <DaveMethvin> i'm excited to see if that one could fix some of these problems
[09:32:15] <markelog> i only need to incorporate yours comment and Jorn comments
[09:32:21] <m_gol> ok, great
[09:32:31] <m_gol> I'd like to get this going, TestSwarm is hard to manage
[09:32:47] <DaveMethvin> yep!
[09:32:49] <m_gol> as you can see in this pretty table: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2681
[09:32:50] <markelog> it is, i need to merge a long time ago, but i was a bit busy
[09:33:04] <markelog> yeah, i notice it )
[09:33:31] <markelog> btw, if we will indeed switch to Karma, would we need a Jenkins still
[09:33:40] <DaveMethvin> so i'm hoping to get the beta out on thursday, does that seem doable?
[09:33:51] <markelog> i remember we talked about it, but it was along time ago
[09:33:52] <DaveMethvin> bug wise i think we should be pretty much done
[09:34:04] <m_gol> I won't be able to get to my stuff this week, I'll be on short holiday Wed-Sun
[09:34:13] <DaveMethvin> infra and testing, if i can get things to pass locally i will be happy
[09:34:18] <m_gol> but the cross-XML stuff can wait until sb wants to pick it up first
[09:34:19] <gibson042> I'm not happy with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1494 :(
[09:34:21] <DaveMethvin> let's see what you have m_gol
[09:34:55] <DaveMethvin> i could look at the XML stuff
[09:35:18] <DaveMethvin> the iOS7 one should be someone with a good way to test :)
[09:35:23] <m_gol> k
[09:35:26] <m_gol> ah, right
[09:35:49] <m_gol> if you could read this issue: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14882
[09:36:02] <DaveMethvin> we'l do what we can on those
[09:36:04] <m_gol> I'd go with blacklisting in such an obscure case but feedback is appreciated
[09:36:25] <DaveMethvin> the XML one isn't that critical, it causes fails on android 2.3 but otherwise not a problem
[09:36:30] <m_gol> that I can do tomorrow, it's just this XML issue requires a little more time so I might not be able to finish it
[09:36:39] <m_gol> but I need your opinion first :)
[09:36:57] <m_gol> I put my findings in a comment
[09:37:10] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't worry about it, we can do the beta without it
[09:37:15] <DaveMethvin> same with the test changes
[09:37:22] <m_gol> k
[09:37:47] <DaveMethvin> it will be nice to see Karma in action, switching one set of problems for another I suspect but new problems smell so much nicer
[09:37:58] <m_gol> Karma still uses iframes, right?
[09:38:11] <m_gol> so the iOS7 issue will persist; that's why we'll probably have to blacklist the test
[09:38:25] <m_gol> what an obscure bug :-)
[09:38:47] <m_gol> also, I need some feedback on this PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1498
[09:39:59] <m_gol> why is boxSizingReliable true on IE<8 which don't have boxSizing? :P
[09:40:17] <m_gol> and true on IE8 that has box-sizing but buggy
[09:41:09] <DaveMethvin> it was defaulting to true?
[09:41:12] <m_gol> yup
[09:41:23] <DaveMethvin> and then we never went thru the code path where it mattered i guess?
[09:41:23] <m_gol> and the test uses gCS so it wasn't run in oldIE at all
[09:41:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:41:36] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:41:50] <DaveMethvin> so this is more a "document reality" thing
[09:41:54] <DaveMethvin> seems like a good idea
[09:42:34] <m_gol> not sure if it's just it
[09:43:07] <m_gol> this line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/3be4f13dc56d7b0cc316e7d8121c5293506dedb8/src/css.js#L193
[09:43:36] <m_gol> maybe I need to write a test that actually fails in IE8
[09:43:43] <m_gol> bc it seems it might hit real code
[09:43:58] <DaveMethvin> i suspect nobody tries to write box-sizing for IE7 etc
[09:44:08] <m_gol> IE<8 doesn't have box-sizing at all so it won't hit this path but IE8 has it
[09:44:09] <DaveMethvin> and if they do they won't expect it to work
[09:44:27] <DaveMethvin> but a test would be good
[09:44:32] <m_gol> I'll try to write a test next week then
[09:44:34] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:45:06] <DaveMethvin> haha you're ahead of me on the agenda, thanks
[09:45:32] <DaveMethvin> looks pretty good, anybody have anything else?
[09:45:46] <m_gol> I'll blacklist the iOS test then, it seems about 0.0001 person will stumble into this specific problem
[09:45:54] <DaveMethvin> i think we covered the other issues
[09:45:59] <m_gol> yup
[09:46:13] <DaveMethvin> still want to do that blog post but need to catch scott and get a few words about UI and Mobile
[09:46:25] <DaveMethvin> so we all talk about ie6/7 at once
[09:46:26] <m_gol> sure, our part seems ready, though
[09:46:32] <DaveMethvin> think so
[09:46:41] <m_gol> we've made it kind of public on jQuery Toronto, right?
[09:46:47] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:46:58] <m_gol> I've seen some tweets
[09:47:05] <DaveMethvin> it's far off enough that most people won't be watching
[09:47:17] <m_gol> did tomatos & eggs fly to the scene? :-)
[09:47:21] <DaveMethvin> or maybe nobody really cares about them anymore ... YAY
[09:47:26] <DaveMethvin> some applause
[09:47:37] <DaveMethvin> there was one guy who really went on a rant about ie 6/7/8
[09:47:42] <DaveMethvin> for like 10 minutes
[09:47:44] <m_gol> lol
[09:48:15] <m_gol> did he know we won't remove 1.12 out of the universe? ;-)
[09:48:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah it will be years
[09:48:32] <DaveMethvin> many many years
[09:48:43] <DaveMethvin> alright that's all i got
[09:48:51] <DaveMethvin> i have to go out and shovel more snow
[09:48:54] <m_gol> :)
[09:49:00] <DaveMethvin> it needs to be spring
[09:49:03] <DaveMethvin> NOW
[09:49:17] <m_gol> no snow in Poland
[09:49:18] <m_gol> ;)
[09:49:22] <DaveMethvin> see you all back in #jquery-dev
