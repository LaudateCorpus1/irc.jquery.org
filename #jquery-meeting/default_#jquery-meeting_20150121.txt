[09:00:58] <jperrault> hello
[09:01:00] <rxaviers> Hello
[09:01:00] <arthurvr> ‘allo!
[09:01:01] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:01:07] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:01:07] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[09:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like today will be a short meeting.
[09:02:21] <fnagel> hey
[09:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything that needs to be discussed for classes or button today?
[09:02:45] <arschmitz> i have a couple things
[09:03:08] <arschmitz> First i mentioned this to jzaefferer and he already said he was ok with it but want to mention here
[09:03:22] <arschmitz> changing how position works in button
[09:03:38] <arschmitz> to not use a class for if you want it at beginning or end only if its top or bottom
[09:03:50] <arschmitz> and just changing the widget to append/prepend accordingly
[09:04:08] <arschmitz> this is how most frameworks do it
[09:04:16] <arschmitz> and it makes a lot more sense semanticly
[09:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> We discussed this in -dev the other day, right?
[09:04:37] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> This is what I was confused about at first?
[09:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, yeah, I'm good with that change (after understanding what you were saying).
[09:05:06] <arschmitz> I think it makes a lot of sense
[09:05:48] <arschmitz> so unless anyone has an objection im going to make that change
[09:05:55] <jzaefferer> still sounds good to me
[09:06:26] <arschmitz> awesome
[09:07:03] <arschmitz> also semi related to buttons iv been working with rending perf tests for chassis on buttons
[09:07:15] <arschmitz> and the suite does a lot of metrics around js too
[09:07:28] <arschmitz> so i think we should look into that side of it for ui and mobile as well
[09:07:49] <arschmitz> http://104.236.81.132:5984//css-perf/_design/site/index.html#/page-select
[09:08:01] <arschmitz> there is no js on those pages but you can see the metric's it looks at
[09:08:30] <arschmitz> we could use this both for regression testing to make sure we dont in advertantly effect things with expensive event handlers or things like that
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> Let's wait for it to be used in Chassis for a while, in case there are any kinks that need to be ironed out over time.
[09:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> But setting this up sounds good.
[09:08:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well many of the kinks woudl likely be different
[09:09:05] <arschmitz> since we will be looking at different things
[09:09:32] <arschmitz> but yeah as far as the general setup it will be very similar
[09:09:41] <arschmitz> so probably best to wait until that part is ironed out
[09:10:24] <arschmitz> the reson i mention here is i wanted to see if in general we are interested because ill keep it in mind as i set up things for chassis
[09:10:36] <arschmitz> to make it as re-usable for both as possible
[09:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's good to have eventually.
[09:11:25] <arschmitz> ok
[09:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for classes or button?
[09:12:02] <arschmitz> sort of
[09:12:24] <arschmitz> i went through the learn article last night and i wonder if we want to either drop or expand the section on custom widgets
[09:12:45] <arschmitz> i think it either needs a lot more detail or we should just skip it and focus on the option
[09:12:51] <arthurvr> It’s open for improvements for sure :)
[09:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> Let's discuss that in the PR.
[09:13:16] <arschmitz> ok
[09:13:39] <arschmitz> thats all then im updating classes pr right now
[09:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:13:51] <arschmitz> waiting for feedback on a few comments before i completely finish
[09:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> The datepicker/calendar split has finally landed in the datepicker branch!
[09:14:08] <arschmitz> Woo!
[09:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure fnagel was super happy to merge that.
[09:14:14] <fnagel> Yeaah!
[09:14:14] <rxaviers> \o/
[09:14:54] <fnagel> Very happy, indeed!
[09:15:10] <jzaefferer> Merged to more PRs for datepicker as well
[09:15:14] <jzaefferer> *two
[09:15:33] <fnagel> Unit Test run in Phantom now
[09:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not worrying about rebasing again means that fnagel is able to work on things faster :-)
[09:16:03] <arschmitz> but its awesome to rebase between branches
[09:16:14] <arschmitz> its even better between branches between projects!
[09:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> hehe
[09:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer rxaviers jasperdegroot: Anything that needs to be discussed about the theme update?
[09:17:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what does that mean exactly?
[09:17:45] <jzaefferer> not worrying about rebasing again
[09:17:55] <jzaefferer> do we go back to merging master into datepicker?
[09:18:12] <jzaefferer> because when I tried to rebase datepicker against master, it immediately failed with some conflict
[09:18:26] <rxaviers> I've updated https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/248 to reflect the new jzaefferer updates (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1420)
[09:18:47] <fnagel> rxaviers: we should merge the Globalize Update PR soon, too
[09:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I meant that fnagel had to keep rebasing his branch with edits to commits, so he didn't want to have more commits in front which might conflict from the edits.
[09:19:04] <jasperdegroot> re: theme update - I think all that needs to be done is https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/249
[09:19:07] <rxaviers> yeap, I must add it back to my list now
[09:19:09] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it removes a step instead of master->datepicker->calendar its just master->datepicker
[09:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> I can do a rebase of datepicker on master and resolve the conflicts.
[09:19:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay; do you have rerere enabled? Recording the resolutions should make that a lot more effective
[09:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> No, rerere scares me.
[09:20:12] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: That would be a great help, thanks!
[09:20:15] <jzaefferer> oh
[09:20:22] <jzaefferer> well
[09:20:25] <rxaviers> jasperdegroot, has created 249, which is a feature request for better UI
[09:20:37] <jzaefferer> if you want to do that despite it...
[09:21:00] <rxaviers> right now, let's focus on getting 248 landed
[09:21:52] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I'll review 248 later
[09:21:58] <jzaefferer> I don't think we need to discuss it here
[09:22:05] <rxaviers> ok for me
[09:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> o
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be sending out a doodle today for the RTL meeting.
[09:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to send dates for the first week of February.
[09:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a decent list of people, so hopefully we'll have a good turn out and figure out a path forward.
[09:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> And that brings us to our last item.
[09:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer just landed the menu change to use ui-state-active instead of ui-state-focus.
[09:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:25:55] <jzaefferer> Which looks stupid until the theme update lands...
[09:26:19] <jperrault> pep...
[09:26:34] <jperrault> I've asked for some help on intern in #PEP, but it hasn't been forthcoming.
[09:26:43] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: when you rebase classes, you'll likely get a conflict in tooltip, need to deal with the added ui-widget-shadow class
[09:27:06] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thats fine
[09:27:11] <arschmitz> i really dont care about conflicts
[09:27:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: they don't bother me ill resolve it
[09:27:48] <jzaefferer> its easier when you know what the change is about :-)
[09:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: I'll ping snover.
[09:28:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thats why we have commit history :-)
[09:28:30] <jzaefferer> jperrault: I've just joined #pep, too; I haven't used intern, but might be able to help anyway
[09:28:48] <jperrault> k.  we can take that to #PEP then.
[09:29:10] <jzaefferer> looks like you already got your answer
[09:29:39] <jperrault> see it, thx
[09:29:59] <jzaefferer> I think that's all for today then
[09:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
[09:30:12] <arthurvr> k. Bye guys!
