[11:07:33] <Wilto> Drunk with power already.
[11:08:11] <Wilto> Boom.
[11:08:23] <Wilto> hax
[11:08:48] <toddmparker_> Hi all
[11:08:56] <uGoMobi> hey
[11:08:58] <JasonDScott_> Hi
[11:09:09] <toddmparker_> Sorry for the delay, the jQuery Mobile team meeting is kicking off
[11:09:16] <toddmparker_> chime in if you're here
[11:09:17] <gseguin> hi
[11:09:19] <Wilto> Now that I’m ops, there are gonna be some CHANGES AROUND HERE.
[11:09:27] <toddmparker_> ruh roh
[11:09:40] <toddmparker_> agenda here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/13X1Uy7v4gScY3qkh9B8NOqNmpobAhHfgp3CZjYz6jHs/edit#
[11:09:56] <toddmparker_> team members - please fill out your sections, sorry I just posted this
[11:10:12] <toddmparker_> I'll go first
[11:10:22] <toddmparker_> Preparing for the DC session this week is the main focus
[11:10:34] <toddmparker_> Tables for docs, triage/bugs, and 1.3 features
[11:11:08] <toddmparker_> Table leads will update the wiki with details before the conference - Anne, Jasper, Todd, etc.
[11:11:32] <toddmparker_> It'll be great to have so much of the team in one place for a few days
[11:11:33] <johnbender> ZOMG I'M HERERRRE
[11:12:15] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:12:16] <toddmparker_> we're also carving out time to sit down with the UI team to start planning out the tab widget re-factor slated for 1.4 which will be a converged widget for UI and mobile
[11:12:35] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:12:42] <toddmparker_> hey
[11:12:46] <toddmparker_> that's it for me
[11:12:52] <toddmparker_> who wants to hop in next?
[11:13:29] <johnbender> me!
[11:13:34] <johnbender> I'll keep it short but I have a lot
[11:13:46] <johnbender> simple-nav branch is pushed
[11:13:52] <johnbender> normalized navigation event is in
[11:14:10] <johnbender> I'm currently working on a navigate method that does double duty of altering the url
[11:14:13] <johnbender> and storing the history
[11:14:42] <johnbender> it also suplements the navigate event by attaching state so that the navigate event can have state attached for _both_ popstate and hashchange events
[11:14:55] <johnbender> still working through it though
[11:15:02] <johnbender> things are looking promising
[11:15:22] <johnbender> either tomorrow or early next week I'll merge in all the branches that I built before we released
[11:15:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Will we be able to uniquely tell where in history one has gone given a hashchange event?
[11:15:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in the same way we do now, yes
[11:15:43] <johnbender> thats one goal
[11:15:50] <johnbender> by "fudging" it
[11:15:53] <johnbender> educated guessing
[11:16:17] <johnbender> again, it's a goal
[11:16:20] <johnbender> I'm still working with it now
[11:16:47] <toddmparker_> great news johnbender - you're cranking on that
[11:17:31] <toddmparker_> will this lay the groundwork for making it easy to hook history tracking into widgets?
[11:17:55] <toddmparker_> for example, would we be able to offload some of the history tracking code in popup to this centralized code?
[11:18:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, it'd be nice not to have to manipulate urlHistory manually.
[11:19:00] <johnbender> yes
[11:19:10] <johnbender> so part of the goal is that the navigate event should contain history information
[11:19:11] <toddmparker_> perfect, that rokks
[11:19:13] <johnbender> like popstate does
[11:19:22] <johnbender> and we can actually attach more if we want
[11:19:28] <johnbender> like where in history we think we are
[11:19:29] <toddmparker_> ic an see us wanting to plumb in history support for all types of interactions so that's great
[11:19:31] <johnbender> because we're tracking
[11:19:38] <johnbender> right
[11:19:42] <johnbender> so there's still a lot of thinkin that has to be done
[11:19:47] <johnbender> it's early but so far I like the ideas
[11:19:49] <toddmparker_> right. this is going to be a good step forward
[11:21:44] <_|Nix|_> So, can I go next?
[11:22:00] <toddmparker_> sure
[11:23:08] <_|Nix|_> OK, not much here. I revisited the WP7 focus thing just in case I missed the reason it was being sloppy last time. It's a disaster. Stay outta there. Things can lose focus even after you've called blur on them three times. Causality has nothing to do with WP7.
[11:23:25] <_|Nix|_> Best to just if ( !$.mobile.browser.ie ) the whole focus thing.
[11:23:45] <_|Nix|_> I accpeted a PR for correctly un-activating li links that open popups.
[11:24:18] <_|Nix|_> I found a fixed-toolbar-related(?) iOS 6 bug (5155)
[11:25:15] <_|Nix|_> I tried to visualize jqm's deps using dot. It's a jungle. Does anybody know a visualization tool that's FLOSS and produces better-looking graphs than dot?
[11:25:38] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and do we cherry-pick dismissable and other popup mods into 1.2-stable, or just bug fixes?
[11:26:07] <gseguin> I vote just bug fixes
[11:26:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[11:26:16] <Wilto> Seconded.
[11:26:22] <uGoMobi> it's new feature, right?
[11:26:42] <toddmparker_> just bug fixes
[11:26:46] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeoman’s work, man. We owe you.
[11:27:05] <agcolom> I was going to ask as well, because I will need to remove my cherry-picking of Maurice's PR then into 1.2-stable
[11:27:06] <toddmparker_> the only feature request we have slated for 1.3 is the option to kill the click out which you already landed, right?
[11:27:21] <toddmparker_> for 1.2 and maintenance releases in general, only bug fixes
[11:27:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah, that's the feature I'm not going to cherry-pick.
[11:27:37] <johnbender> Wilto: actually it's quite fun
[11:27:38] <toddmparker_> sure, cool
[11:28:08] <_|Nix|_> OK, so if you guys don
[11:28:17] <_|Nix|_> 't know any dot-like tool, I;m done.
[11:28:23] <toddmparker_> any have suggestions re: dependency mapping?
[11:29:11] <uGoMobi> no, sorry
[11:29:59] <_|Nix|_> OK. Thanks!
[11:30:28] <agcolom> Can I go next?
[11:32:30] <toddmparker_> sure agcolom
[11:32:40] <agcolom> ok, thanks... here it is:
[11:32:43] <agcolom>     Completed listview (api docs)
[11:32:43] <agcolom>     added dismissable to popup options
[11:32:43] <agcolom>     Need to revert 34a32ee
[11:32:43] <agcolom>     Preparing todo list for DC (please everyone step in to add what needs documenting that is not a widget):
[11:33:36] <agcolom> So I need to revert 34a32ee where I cherry-picked dismissable into 1.2-stable...
[11:33:58] <agcolom> but I've never done that... Is there a risk of me breaking everything?
[11:34:17] <toddmparker_> ah, right. don't want that
[11:34:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I can do that.
[11:34:30] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thanks!
[11:34:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: NP.
[11:34:41] <toddmparker_> no, I don't think so
[11:34:49] <toddmparker_> thanks _|Nix|_
[11:35:01] <gseguin> agcolom: let Wilto  do it, then we can blame it on him
[11:35:02] <agcolom> Then I'd like input from you guys about what else we need to document in the api docs.
[11:35:10] <toddmparker_> yeah, we want to be conservative, even with fixes for maintenance releases
[11:35:14] <agcolom> (I have put a list on the agenda)
[11:35:26] <_|Nix|_> If you let me do it, you can blame Canada!
[11:35:26] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:35:27] <Wilto> Yeah; screw that Wilto guwait a second
[11:35:50] <toddmparker_> if we have a fix and there is a shadow of doubt f whether it could cause issues, I'd rather not add it to a maintenance release
[11:36:19] <agcolom> I have also added a few articles to the resources page...
[11:36:30] <toddmparker_> thanks for that
[11:36:57] <agcolom> We need to add BB10 to the blog post and device supported page
[11:37:26] <toddmparker_> right
[11:37:29] <JasonDScott_> +1
[11:37:34] <agcolom> But we need to specify on which device it was tested...
[11:38:04] <JasonDScott_> Dev Alpha
[11:38:12] <toddmparker_> agcolom - that todo list looks good
[11:38:13] <toddmparker_> we can move that to the wiki page before monday
[11:38:24] <agcolom> ok, great
[11:38:28] <toddmparker_> I really thought I had added that already, sorry
[11:38:50] <agcolom> Then I'm flying saturday morning!
[11:39:36] <toddmparker_> yeah? safe travels!
[11:39:45] <toddmparker_> we're arriving sunday night
[11:40:03] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: want to go?
[11:40:08] <agcolom> And that's it from me ! I'm nearly done with secondary school application/refs/visits! so will be better when I get back!
[11:40:08] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:40:18] <toddmparker_> thanks agcolom
[11:40:30] <uGoMobi> flagged issues for DC summit:
[11:40:30] <uGoMobi> label Dev summit + milestone 1.1.2: fixed toolbar and transition issues
[11:40:30] <uGoMobi> label Dev summit + milestone 1.3: RWD tickets
[11:41:30] <uGoMobi> are there more issues we want to plan to work on
[11:41:47] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:42:48] <uGoMobi> I think this is already a lot of work and we can always add later
[11:42:54] <toddmparker_> think that's is a good set
[11:42:58] <uGoMobi> will open new issues on dev-summit repo that link to those and give them a table label
[11:42:58] <uGoMobi> table 13 Mobile Triage - change into Mobile RWD?
[11:42:58] <uGoMobi> table 14 Mobile Bugs
[11:43:08] <toddmparker_> maybe any flashing/blinking PG issues?
[11:43:17] <toddmparker_> seems to be a problem in some cases
[11:43:21] <uGoMobi> yes, that's "transitions"
[11:43:27] <toddmparker_> ah, gotcha
[11:43:33] <toddmparker_> think that sounds good
[11:44:07] <toddmparker_> i want to make a ticket to track experiments on that RWD panel widget we're playing with - makes it easy to make a facebook style left panel
[11:44:14] <toddmparker_> but also top, right, bottom
[11:44:20] <toddmparker_> and slide over vs. push
[11:44:30] <uGoMobi> yes, I saw that demo, cool
[11:44:38] <toddmparker_> think that may be easy so I want to hack on it a bit next week with wilto and scottjehl
[11:44:55] <Wilto> Sir, yes sir.
[11:44:57] <toddmparker_> it'll be a reach goal
[11:44:58] <uGoMobi> so do we want to split this in 2 tables?
[11:45:11] <uGoMobi> one table for bugs and one for the 1.3 stuff
[11:45:26] <toddmparker_> but the RWD frid stuff might be very modest so having another RWD layout thing to dig into would be good
[11:45:31] <toddmparker_> yes
[11:45:39] <toddmparker_> new dev will be separate from triage/bugs
[11:46:04] <toddmparker_> think i already renamed a table to Mobile dev / UI testing
[11:46:05] <uGoMobi> ok, than I just change that table name
[11:46:07] <toddmparker_> that is the new dev
[11:46:34] <uGoMobi> ah ok, then it's probably just the label at the issue tracker that needs to be updated
[11:46:39] <uGoMobi> will check that
[11:46:48] <toddmparker_> we will have to see who really shows up and their interest/skills and tweak tables on monday
[11:46:51] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:47:03] <toddmparker_> think we have a triage table led by you
[11:47:16] <toddmparker_> and a bug fix table with wilto and gseguin
[11:47:28] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:47:35] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott_  and _|Nix|_ are also in those tables
[11:47:36] <Wilto> I’m bringing in a ringer, to ensure our table wins.
[11:47:39] <toddmparker_> lots of bouncing
[11:47:46] <Wilto> It’s JohnResig in a fake mustache.
[11:48:04] <toddmparker_> but if we have a good list of bugs, some triage tasks and new dev tasks along with docs todo, we'll be in good shape
[11:48:27] <uGoMobi> I am not sure about the triage tasks
[11:48:48] <uGoMobi> if we have devs there I think we better use them to fix bugs
[11:49:08] <toddmparker_> was wondering if we could have a few people just looking through ever bug, closing junk ones, helping to elevate bad ones, etc.
[11:49:17] <toddmparker_> closing dupes, etc
[11:49:37] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:49:59] <toddmparker_> sure, but we may have technical people there who aren't up to speed enough to fix things but familiar enough to sort thru issues
[11:50:01] <uGoMobi> but I don't really see that separated from bug fixing
[11:50:12] <uGoMobi> I understand
[11:50:25] <toddmparker_> yeah, we'll have to see if that makes sense
[11:50:29] <uGoMobi> we'll have to see
[11:50:32] <toddmparker_> some of it will depend on who is there
[11:50:39] <toddmparker_> interests, skills
[11:50:45] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:50:53] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:50:57] <uGoMobi> still working on:
[11:50:57] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045 (slider full width) - conclusion: we need to wrap input and slider in a div to do this, looking into impact of that change
[11:51:06] <toddmparker_> having a lsit of stuff we'd like to tackle is important up-front.
[11:51:24] <toddmparker_> we can then prioritize based on time and who can work on things
[11:51:32] <toddmparker_> great uGoMobi
[11:51:39] <uGoMobi> yes, that's most important... what table does what is something we can decide their
[11:51:42] <uGoMobi> there*
[11:51:53] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:52:13] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875 (IE10 transitions) - requires quite some changes in support.js to make it work with unprefixed props too
[11:52:18] <toddmparker_> the triage stuff just might be good work for a person who's interested. there are  lot of issues to be reviewed
[11:52:37] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yeah?
[11:52:45] <toddmparker_> why is that?
[11:53:15] <uGoMobi> because the whole valideStyle function is designed to work with prefixed props
[11:53:31] <uGoMobi> and 3Dtransform test too
[11:53:34] <johnbender> s/valideStyle/validStyle/
[11:53:41] <toddmparker_> ahhh
[11:53:44] <toddmparker_> eesh
[11:53:47] <uGoMobi> thanks johnbender :)
[11:53:48] <johnbender> hopefully I'm not the only one who adds spurious 'e's onto things
[11:53:51] <toddmparker_> ok, a good task for next week
[11:53:56] <johnbender> I spell custom => custome
[11:54:00] <johnbender> and I have no idea why
[11:54:04] <toddmparker_> olde englishe
[11:54:11] <johnbender> right
[11:54:23] <johnbender> but living in LA I'm not exposed all that often
[11:54:24] <toddmparker_> i am a typo machine
[11:54:29] <johnbender> dito
[11:54:29] <toddmparker_> true
[11:54:32] <uGoMobi> I am just mixing dutch with english
[11:54:37] <toddmparker_> ah
[11:54:49] <toddmparker_> is gseguin here?
[11:54:52] <gseguin> yup
[11:54:56] <toddmparker_> oh, hey
[11:55:01] <gseguin> not much to report though
[11:55:02] <toddmparker_> not showing up in my member list
[11:55:15] <gseguin> started looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5096
[11:55:18] <toddmparker_> I see an empty bullet
[11:55:21] <gseguin> but got sidetracked
[11:55:51] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[11:55:54] <toddmparker_> that would be cool
[11:56:16] <gseguin> I'm on jQM today so if there is something I can get completed for the summit by the end of the day, send it my way
[11:56:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ882QYzr-M
[11:56:30] <gseguin> otherwise I'll try to make progress on that issue
[11:56:39] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:56:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: :D
[11:56:45] <toddmparker_> do you want to take this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5090
[11:56:50] <toddmparker_> should be a quick win
[11:57:18] <gseguin> sure
[11:57:26] <gseguin> I'll take it
[11:57:40] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:57:45] <uGoMobi> I already had a quick look at that one some time ago
[11:57:45] <toddmparker_> re-assigned
[11:58:01] <toddmparker_> yeah - if you have any words of wisdom for gseguin
[11:58:13] <toddmparker_> you guys can collaborate on it
[11:58:21] <gseguin> yup
[11:58:22] <uGoMobi> not that complex but annoying thing is the the corner style functions of our listview widget
[11:59:09] <toddmparker_> but doesn't he filter already work with all the corner logic?
[11:59:35] <toddmparker_> seems the same as typing some bunk string like s98c98d7sf987sdaf98 into the filter - all woudl hide
[11:59:49] <toddmparker_> yikes, just realized I have to wrap up
[11:59:55] <toddmparker_> I have another meeting unfortunately
[12:00:16] <gseguin> ok
[12:00:23] <uGoMobi> I don't recall exactly but I remember there was something, will look at it again gseguin
[12:00:47] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:00:54] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'll ping you on -dev if I have questions
[12:01:00] <toddmparker_> cool
[12:01:01] <gseguin> thanks everyone
[12:01:02] <uGoMobi> gseguin ok
[12:01:07] <toddmparker_> alright, thanks all
[12:01:13] <toddmparker_> think we have to wrap up
[12:01:17] <toddmparker_> or at least I need to drop
[12:01:24] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott_ any updates?
[12:01:36] <JasonDScott_> Fixed issues related to the BlackBerry 10 theme
[12:01:42] <JasonDScott_> Heads up - New BlackBerry specific css properties for BB10
[12:01:49] <JasonDScott_> -webkit-overflow-scrolling: -blackberry-touch;
[12:01:56] <JasonDScott_> Same as -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch but adds over scroll even when the region doesn't need to scroll (bb10 style).
[12:02:02] <JasonDScott_> text-overflow: -blackberry-fade;
[12:02:07] <uGoMobi> interesting
[12:02:09] <JasonDScott_> text fades with a linear opacity gradient left to right
[12:02:29] <Wilto> …huh.
[12:02:35] <toddmparker_> interesting
[12:02:36] <gseguin> oh great! more vendor prefixes
[12:02:50] <toddmparker_> that's what they are for
[12:03:04] <JasonDScott_> yup :)
[12:03:05] <JasonDScott_> Wilto: which part?
[12:03:41] <Wilto> Oh, a “huh” of non-verbal interest. Not “I am confused.”
[12:03:54] <JasonDScott_> Wilto: ahh
[12:03:55] <JasonDScott_> ok
[12:04:29] <JasonDScott_> they just add nice styles
[12:04:29] <toddmparker_> I want to try out that scrolling behavior
[12:04:37] <toddmparker_> charging up a device with BB10
[12:04:46] <toddmparker_> I see
[12:04:49] <JasonDScott_> we support the others still, we are not breaking the web
[12:05:42] <toddmparker_> good that you added this property but will this override the iOS version?
[12:05:45] <Wilto> Oh, so the standard iOS Safari one works?
[12:05:49] <toddmparker_> same prop, different values
[12:05:56] <toddmparker_> ah, perfect
[12:06:07] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:06:16] <JasonDScott_> yes the iOS one works too
[12:06:45] <JasonDScott_> ours is just fancier
[12:06:48] <JasonDScott_> :)
[12:07:01] <gseguin> nice
[12:08:10] <JasonDScott_> Is there anything I can do to help prepare for next week?
[12:09:26] <JasonDScott_> *cricket* … is everyone playing with the new scrolling?
[12:09:35] <uGoMobi> do we only need to make tickets on dev-summit repo or also a to do list somewhere?
[12:11:11] <uGoMobi> anyone?
[12:11:48] <gseguin> I think the tickets are the todos
[12:11:59] <uGoMobi> think so too
[12:12:23] <uGoMobi> I will make those today or tomorrow
[12:13:13] <gseguin> alright see you guys on -dev
[12:13:45] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:15:38] <uGoMobi> I guess Wilto turns off the lights here
[12:15:46] <Wilto> Oh, right.
[12:16:07] <Wilto> Later, guys.
