[09:03:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, arthurvr, markelog, m_gol meeting time!

[09:03:48] <DaveMethvin> hi!
[09:03:50] <arthurvr> hey
[09:04:23] <markelog> hey-hey!
[09:04:39] <m_gol> present
[09:05:08] <timmywil> So, we don't actually have any issues marked for review, but the biggest issue that still plagues us is show/hide
[09:05:29] <timmywil> markelog kindly put together a PR for us https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2374
[09:05:44] <markelog> btw, nice explanation on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2381
[09:06:04] <markelog> we want the blog post, correct?
[09:06:47] <DaveMethvin> that seems best, at least we can say we asked
[09:07:12] <timmywil> The only thing I feel strongly about on this issue is that we shouldn't add another method to the API. Though there would be advantages, it makes the API ugly and it's confusing.
[09:07:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah the downside of adding a new method would be that most people continue to use the old one
[09:07:42] <DaveMethvin> so we don't improve perf
[09:07:48] <DaveMethvin> and might as well not bother
[09:07:58] <markelog> what do we want to achive with the blog post?
[09:08:01] <markelog> new ideas?
[09:08:08] <markelog> or permission?
[09:08:20] <gibson042> permission, IMO
[09:08:23] <DaveMethvin> there doesn't seem to be any way to "fix" show/hide
[09:08:54] <DaveMethvin> so i think it would be interesting to see if our changes can be handled by the community
[09:09:18] <markelog> well, statistically speaking, that users sample wouldn't be big enough
[09:09:32] <DaveMethvin> agreed, but at least we publish our thoughts
[09:09:46] <markelog> seems as new ideas then )
[09:09:48] <DaveMethvin> just like the 1.9 changes, a lot of code will prob break
[09:10:00] <timmywil> or, we eat the perf problem
[09:10:07] <markelog> yeah, but i fear a great amount now
[09:10:15] <markelog> by "eat" you mean revert?
[09:10:49] <markelog> i guess that would be single biggest back-compat change we ever had
[09:11:02] <timmywil> sort of, we can still integrate some improvements, but it seems to me that the biggest roadblock we have in accomplishing that is our avoidance of retrieving computed display
[09:11:04] <markelog> non-back-compat )
[09:11:09] <gibson042> did .show always trump the cascade?
[09:11:10] <DaveMethvin> we do have the super good improvement in Sizzle that uses the cached selector if it was there, i wonder if we should at least put out a minor point updated with stuff like that
[09:11:21] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: yes
[09:11:26] <DaveMethvin> it was a "feature"
[09:12:03] <DaveMethvin> and all the other "features" piled on top of it :) :(
[09:12:26] <markelog> we can consider mine "kind" pr, but i fear we would face the same issues
[09:12:42] <markelog> we can fix some of the problems described in the pull
[09:12:44] <markelog> but still
[09:12:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I think we can keep the post specific to show/hide without sowing concern about other methods.
[09:13:07] <timmywil> The 3.0 blog post has lots of good stuff
[09:13:25] <markelog> oh, right, have couple ideas about it
[09:13:27] <timmywil> and we can publish a version of that for the alpha
[09:13:31] <markelog> what is the link again?
[09:13:52] <gibson042> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcfR24rfK7bFFwlX2-PPjr7MPe6E0aVZ1wfih061INM/edit
[09:13:55] <markelog> we will have two blog posts right?
[09:14:05] <markelog> one for show/hide and one for the 3.0?
[09:14:15] <markelog> gibson042: cool, thanks
[09:14:15] <timmywil> right, the show/hide one would be pre-3.0
[09:14:29] <timmywil> at least that what I was thinking
[09:14:33] <DaveMethvin> the 3.0 one on release of the alpha
[09:14:34] <timmywil> that's
[09:14:43] <DaveMethvin> and the show/hide sooner?
[09:14:50] <timmywil> ya
[09:15:23] <timmywil> If we do it. I'm starting to wonder if we should just try something.
[09:15:36] <markelog> i bet there someone must present the idea with hide() doing something like "position:absolute; left: -9999px;..." instead of "dispaly: none"
[09:16:01] <DaveMethvin> that has screen reader implications tho as well
[09:16:03] <gibson042> about which we would have much to say regarding accessibility
[09:16:14] <m_gol> or rtl langs ;)
[09:16:23] <timmywil> Actually, if we go ahead and put something out for show/hide in the alpha, the 3.0 blog post can offer explanation and request feedback
[09:17:00] <timmywil> I know I've flip-flopped here
[09:17:05] <markelog> it might be drown the issue, many might not notice it
[09:17:28] <gibson042> it's the first heading under "Major changes"
[09:17:57] <DaveMethvin> and again it's an alpha so it's a good time to experiment
[09:18:07] <markelog> and when they do, we will feel the wrath )
[09:18:16] <timmywil> Just an idea, but we can ask major hitters like Paul and Addy to ask for feedback as well
[09:18:27] <markelog> that would be good
[09:18:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah let them take some heat too! :)
[09:18:37] <markelog> also would be good to hear their feedback as well
[09:18:54] <markelog> paul_irish:?
[09:19:04] <DaveMethvin> i don't think forcing display:block is going to work very well, there would need to be some override
[09:19:14] <timmywil> and Mike Taylor
[09:19:54] <markelog> so we are leaning to one blog post?
[09:20:36] <timmywil> +1
[09:20:45] <DaveMethvin> the thing about the animations is that to make them work properly you'd need a completion function to add the "hidden" class for example
[09:21:05] <DaveMethvin> that's even more of a prob than show/hide imo
[09:21:44] <timmywil> I have to pee like whoa
[09:22:32] <DaveMethvin> TIM
[09:22:33] <DaveMethvin> TMI
[09:22:52] <timmywil> TMI TIM
[09:22:56] <timmywil> my nickname
[09:23:48] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:24:09] <timmywil> The rest I had was just requests to land some stuff, pending team approval. There are 4 that look good to me.
[09:24:23] <timmywil> They're in the notes.
[09:24:49] <timmywil> I'll cut it short so I can go pee. I'm in -dev after that.
[09:25:09] <timmywil> Thanks everybody!
[09:25:11] <markelog> short meeting )
[09:25:18] <m_gol> cu ;)
[09:25:20] <timmywil> for a change :)
