[09:00:36] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:00:38] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:46] <rxaviers> Hello
[09:00:47] <tj_vantoll1> hey
[09:00:58] * rxaviers likes the new bot command
[09:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:01:03] <arthurvr> hi guys!
[09:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we had another week of increased tickets :-/
[09:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully next week I'll be able to work on reducing that again.
[09:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> Right now I'm in the middle of the classes PR review.
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> I know tj_vantoll1 has a few PRs that need review, which should help with the ticket count as well.
[09:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz is there anything to discuss for button today?
[09:03:26] <arschmitz> no
[09:03:28] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah just some odds and ends.
[09:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1432 is ready to land.
[09:03:47] <arschmitz> i think jzaeffereris going to review again once classes is on master
[09:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> Hope you enjoyed your vacation.
[09:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> Well hopefully that will be very soon :-)
[09:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Is there anything that needs to be discussed for datepicker today?
[09:05:15] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: thanks, nice weather and good snow :-D
[09:05:39] <fnagel> No, did not found time yet to merge and dig into the wiki changes
[09:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything that needs to be discussed for CSS dependencies today?
[09:06:27] <rxaviers> I have no updates for this week
[09:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:06:36] <fnagel> rxaviers: any news regarding your Globalize / Calendar PR?
[09:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Let's talk quickly about Globalize.
[09:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:06:50] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:07:17] <rxaviers> Sure... fnagel, I haven't had time to tackle Globalze / Calendar yet.
[09:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> You've moved up the release date for 1.0.0, correct?
[09:09:36] <fnagel> rxaviers: Ok. Any thought about removing these selected properties and getters from $.date? I've noticed you did clean up $.date within your PR.
[09:11:01] <rxaviers> The idea is to release 1.0.0 earlier (without currency parsing)
[09:11:01] <rxaviers> So, in theory 1.0.0 would have what it needs for calendar. But, not for spinner demo.
[09:11:40] <rxaviers> which properties (you need to refresh my memory)
[09:12:19] <arschmitz> so that would mean we would not adopt 1.0.0 in ui then correct?
[09:12:45] <arschmitz> would/could
[09:13:46] <fnagel> There is a selected property with related getter / setter: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/datepicker/external/date.js#L183-L189
[09:14:18] <fnagel> This would mean to remove the current property from the day objects: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/datepicker/external/date.js#L156
[09:14:42] <jzaefferer> For UI its not much of a change really
[09:14:54] <jzaefferer> We'll just start using it once it has currency parsing, like we planned
[09:15:11] <jzaefferer> But at least we can provide a stable release to anyone who doesn't need that, right now
[09:15:20] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: right i only meant what version we would adopt it in
[09:15:22] <jzaefferer> Its already been very stable for months anyway
[09:15:30] <jzaefferer> Probably 1.1.0
[09:15:31] <arschmitz> previously we had talked about 1.0 now it would be 1.1 or something
[09:15:36] <jzaefferer> Yeah, something
[09:16:18] <arschmitz> ok yeah makes sense
[09:16:25] <jzaefferer> instead of 16 alpha releases, we could be at 1.5.4 or whatever by now...
[09:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> Well, datepicker won't ship until 1.13 anyway.
[09:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> We'll use whatever version of Globalize is out by then.
[09:17:32] * rxaviers has opened the "Files changed" tab of the PR#1341 (datepicker-globalize-1.x branch) and it's taking awhile
[09:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> And that will have to include currency parsing.
[09:17:53] <rxaviers> Ok
[09:17:56] <arschmitz> rxaviers: heh dont open that tab on classes pr
[09:18:04] <rxaviers> :P
[09:18:04] <arschmitz> its painfull
[09:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> But if 1.0.0 is happening soon, we should just wait for that and pull that in to datepicker.
[09:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Is there an approx. ETA for that?
[09:18:44] <rxaviers> Technically, 1.0.0 could be released now.
[09:19:06] <rxaviers> I'd like to discuss what the team things about whether or not a blog post should be written in sync with the release.
[09:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so it sounds like we should wait for that to happen, then rebase this PR and switch it to use 1.0.0.
[09:19:11] <rxaviers> thinks*
[09:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Let's discuss that in 40 minutes ;-)
[09:19:26] <rxaviers> yeap ;)
[09:20:42] <rxaviers> fnagel, that select method is still present on my rebase (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1341/files#diff-b2fccddb29452175f8032dd5ae8ccb61R225)
[09:21:29] <rxaviers> we could talk about that after the meeting if you want to.
[09:21:41] <fnagel> rxaviers: Ok
[09:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure you all saw that 1.11.3 was released.
[09:24:13] <scott_gonzalez> Which brings us to the last item on the agenda.
[09:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> Publishing to npm: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11101
[09:25:09] <scott_gonzalez> What are people's thoughts on this?
[09:25:32] <arschmitz> we have the same thing regularly on mobile
[09:26:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer said "I've contacted the author of the npm package (see also  https://github.com/devongovett/jqueryui-npm ) and asked for his plans. "
[09:26:52] <rxaviers> What happened then?
[09:27:50] <jzaefferer> let me look that up...
[09:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure how that package is intended to be used.
[09:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> It points back to our repo.
[09:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> But the README says that it's intended to be used with Browserify.
[09:28:47] <jzaefferer> Yeah, he created that for browserify. He said he'd try to update it, though since he hasn't bothered with 1.11 at all, I doubt anything will happen
[09:29:16] <jzaefferer> I asked if he could unfork into https://github.com/components/jqueryui - but I didn't get a response to that
[09:30:09] <jzaefferer> considering the changes planned for npm@3 (flat installs by default), I see the need for bower to vanish complelety, so we should public to npm...
[09:30:25] <tj_vantoll1> Agreed
[09:30:31] <jzaefferer> he also offered to transfer ownership for the npm package
[09:31:05] <jzaefferer> *should publish to npm
[09:32:02] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, do you see the need or possibility for bower to disappear after npm makes flat installs?
[09:33:26] <jzaefferer> well, once npm does flat installs, there's no point in using bower anymore
[09:33:39] <jzaefferer> there's plenty reasons against using bower already
[09:35:18] <rxaviers> it doesn't necessarily mean it needs to vanish. But, yeap that could happen
[09:35:32] <rxaviers> :P
[09:36:23] <jzaefferer> yeah, just saying that the need would vanish, not that bower itself would vanish
[09:36:37] <rxaviers> Considering npm@3 will make flat installs, which is the pre-req for browser apps, it makes sense to have UI on npm.
[09:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> What would we publish?
[09:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> source only?
[09:37:50] <tj_vantoll1> What does Core do?
[09:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> Who knows? They have an empty repo. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-dist
[09:39:06] <tj_vantoll1> npm install jquery gives me src and dist directories
[09:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/release/dist.js#L52
[09:39:36] <tj_vantoll1> This seems like a jQuery-project-wide discussion.
[09:40:00] <rxaviers> We often come to this question on UI :P
[09:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> They publish source files and the monolith.
[09:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if that's going to npm though.
[09:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> We can ask on the dev leads call.
[09:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:43:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what the possibilities are?
[09:43:32] <rxaviers> do we have anything in mind to publish on npm?
[09:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> I would prefer to only publish source files.
[09:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, individual component files.
[09:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> What's in the tag right now.
[09:44:12] <rxaviers> when you say source files, I assume you don't want to include the concated jquery-ui.js with all components. Right?
[09:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[09:44:28] <rxaviers> Ok. I'm +1
[09:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> And no minfied files.
[09:44:50] <rxaviers> +1
[09:44:53] <tj_vantoll1> I agree with source files only, but I'm not sure if there are any expected npm conventions on this sort of thing.
[09:44:59] <arschmitz> im +1 also
[09:45:28] <arschmitz> but i know we have had issues on both bower and npm for mobile for people wanting full files including min
[09:45:58] <arschmitz> so thats fun all the time
[09:46:18] <rxaviers> That's another issue. In my opinio, we should teach people how to do that by their own if that's the case.
[09:46:26] <rxaviers> opinion*
[09:46:27] <rxaviers> :D
[09:47:14] <rxaviers> npm's main property usually points to a single entry. I don't know what happened to that: it didnt work well for repos with several entry points (like UI). I remember having chatted with scott_gonzalez about it and we found a solition.
[09:47:16] <rxaviers> solution*
[09:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> You can require( "module/some/deep/path" )
[09:47:59] <rxaviers> ok
[09:48:25] <rxaviers> So, back to the "which files to publish", what about themes? Existing packages include themes.
[09:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/build.js#L11
[09:48:40] <rxaviers> But, we don't on our tags.
[09:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we should include anything but base.
[09:49:40] <arschmitz> +1
[09:50:13] <tj_vantoll1> At the very least we should start with just base.
[09:50:36] <rxaviers> ok
[09:51:05] <rxaviers> no more questions
[09:51:10] <arschmitz> on mobile we don't even have other pre made themes and no one has ever asked for them either
[09:52:23] <rxaviers> A theme gallery seems big enough to become its own distinct project.
[09:53:01] <arschmitz> rxaviers: not to mention we should encourage true custom themes not just theme roller settings presets i think
[09:53:07] <arschmitz> but thats a totally different issue
[09:53:14] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that's everything on the agenda for today.
[09:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
