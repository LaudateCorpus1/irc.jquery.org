[09:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:01:23] <kborchers> hi
[09:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone from infrastructure here?
[09:04:09] <rworth> hey
[09:04:12] <jzaefferer> hello party people
[09:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not :-/
[09:05:05] <jzaefferer> danheberden_? clarkbox?
[09:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> Download builder is serving bad zips again.
[09:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Probably out of disk space.
[09:06:01] <danheberden_> jzaefferer yo
[09:06:15] <jzaefferer> ^^^
[09:07:14] <danheberden_> jzaefferer being fixed as we speak
[09:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks danheberden_
[09:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for infrastructure?
[09:09:10] <danheberden_> scott_gonzalez not much until we get that time contract ironed out - i *did* get the servers from mt
[09:09:18] <danheberden_> so that's good news :)
[09:09:44] <danheberden_> i mean, they're all running windows2000, but that's ok, right?
[09:09:53] <jzaefferer> danheberden_: could we move Jenkins to its own server?
[09:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> woohoo
[09:10:09] <rworth> yay
[09:10:19] <danheberden_> jzaefferer yes, but i really want to have the plan done before we start moving shit, ya know?
[09:10:22] <jzaefferer> the current box is also serving various sites
[09:10:25] <rworth> not windows ME? awwww
[09:10:31] <danheberden_> jzaefferer yeah, i have no idea why it's all one one effing server
[09:10:32] <jzaefferer> danheberden_: yeah :/
[09:10:48] <danheberden_> like, jqm build stuff is running, swarm
[09:10:55] <danheberden_> not to mention wp for jqm (i think)
[09:11:19] <danheberden_> jzaefferer lemme see about getting a smaller ve for that
[09:11:21] <danheberden_> in the meantime
[09:11:24] <danheberden_> that we can move to
[09:11:28] <danheberden_> you're the one that set that up, right?
[09:11:35] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:11:39] <danheberden_> you java nerd you
[09:11:50] <danheberden_> cool, lemme see about getting a new playground for you at least in the interum
[09:12:07] <jzaefferer> the whole config and jobs are all in one folder, so shouldn't be much of a problem to move that
[09:12:14] <danheberden_> sweet
[09:12:21] <jzaefferer> once Jenkins itself is running somewhere else, along with Java and whatnot
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so 1.8.17 is finally fixed
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> Turns out the bad i18n files were in more places than we originally thought.
[09:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> But it's all fixed now.
[09:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.18 will probably go live based on when the new build script is ready.
[09:14:36] <rworth> no word from gnarf on that?
[09:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> We already have 13 fixes in.
[09:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> Not yet.
[09:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> We had a discussion yesterday about 1.9 and decided to shift some things around to get 1.9 out earlier.
[09:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> The widgets that we've already started API redesigns for will go into 1.9.
[09:16:27] <rworth> as well as the new widgets
[09:16:37] <rworth> that are in master
[09:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> All of the new widgets that are already in master (spinner, tooltip, menu) will be in 1.9  as well.
[09:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> The other widgets will be pushed to 1.10.
[09:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> Most of the infrastructure changes will be pushed to 1.10 as well.
[09:17:18] <jzaefferer> selectmenu probably won't, but with 1.9 now being a lot closer, it'll land in 1.10 which isn't that far off then either...
[09:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> The big infrastructure change that will stay in 1.9 is the new docs site.
[09:18:00] <jzaefferer> Finally getting us off of Mediawiki/docs.jquery.com
[09:18:21] <kborchers> selectmenu is listed under 2.0 in the roadmap with the other form controls. should we change that?
[09:19:49] <jzaefferer> kborchers: good point, but I don't think we need to. Once we're at the point where Scott is comfortable with landing it in master, we can see which release will be next for it to land.
[09:20:06] <kborchers> sounds good
[09:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, ideally it'd be grouped with a bunch of form controls, but I'm fine with it landing earlier if it's ready.
[09:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to get a few complaints that we're just adding to the inconsistency of form styling.
[09:21:11] <kborchers> i think there are more people that want it than would complain though
[09:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> But the number of people complaining will probably be small compared to the number of people who are happy that another widget has landed.
[09:21:24] <kborchers> :)
[09:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:21:37] <rworth> :)
[09:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> And honestly, for those who complain, they're not in any worse of a position by just ignoring selectmenu until we have full form styling...
[09:22:28] <kborchers> yep
[09:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox has been working on the TestSwarm/BrowserStack integration.
[09:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> BrowserStack's API went into public beta today http://www.browserstack.com/automated-browser-testing-api
[09:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> I published a node module for it now that it's public https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-browserstack
[09:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox is using the module for the integration
[09:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything on the agenda. Anyone have anything else?
[09:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden_: Is download builder fixed now?
[09:26:55] <danheberden_> scott_gonzalez should be - proxy was acting up
[09:27:00] <danheberden_> *was*
[09:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll close the ticket. Thanks.
[09:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it for today.
[09:31:29] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez or clarkbox: is the integration code somewhere?
[09:31:40] <jzaefferer> like a repo?
[09:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: unknown, I haven't seen any of the code
