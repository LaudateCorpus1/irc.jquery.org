[10:02:20] <ajpiano> hop
[10:02:38] <agcolom> Hi!
[10:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[10:03:07] <ajpiano> hey so
[10:03:20] <ajpiano> i am one like arduously procrastination filled blog post away from the doing learn
[10:03:36] <ajpiano> i guess i have just been nervous to have it live
[10:03:48] <ajpiano> i have a haircut in an hour, then i'll come home and write that
[10:04:03] <ajpiano> even thought it *is already live*
[10:04:17] <ajpiano> so that's the situation with that
[10:04:26] <gnarf> hi!
[10:04:26] <agcolom> excellent news!
[10:04:32] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: did you see the build proces stuff?
[10:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> Not yet.
[10:04:48] <ajpiano> cool
[10:05:24] <ajpiano> gnarf: fyi https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/tree/grunt-build
[10:05:54] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i got as far as getting jshint, js and css minification, and stylus
[10:06:09] <ajpiano> i just took base.css and changed it into a .styl
[10:06:16] <ajpiano> without actually changing anything to use stylus conventions
[10:06:35] <ajpiano> and then started gradually layering stuff on, and i'll continue with that
[10:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a good way to start.
[10:06:51] <ajpiano> i wanted the commits to be able to tell you more about what i did than me :p
[10:06:56] <ajpiano> so i wanted to see that it just worked
[10:07:06] <ajpiano> then do some changes that like, idiomatic stylus
[10:07:09] <ajpiano> so you can see that in action
[10:07:29] <ajpiano> so like, now the primary brand colors are variables
[10:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll check that out today.
[10:07:59] <ajpiano> and then i like, refactored this section to do it "the stylus way" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/grunt-build/themes/jquery/stylus/global-nav.styl
[10:08:31] <ajpiano> so yeah, lot more to do there
[10:08:46] <ajpiano> but now there is a place to make progress
[10:09:00] <ajpiano> also, between the hack i put in around Stripe in plugins.js
[10:09:04] <ajpiano> and minification of css and js
[10:09:19] <ajpiano> i already shaved off like 40% of our kb on page load
[10:09:31] <ajpiano> :)
[10:10:03] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: are you ok with the stripe hack? it's in master too
[10:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:10:38] <ajpiano> yah, i realised just how much of the page load it was responsible for and i was like, this must not continue
[10:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, stripe is ridiculous.
[10:11:39] <ajpiano> yeah, i mean, it's fine for what it is
[10:11:55] <ajpiano> you just shouldn't pay those kilobytes/http reqs
[10:11:57] <ajpiano> on every page
[10:12:11] <ajpiano> that brings up two questions i had though scott_gonzalez
[10:12:31] <ajpiano> 1) should we keep loading jquery from the cdn?
[10:12:50] <ajpiano> i think it's faster to include it in our concatted js
[10:13:20] <ajpiano> 2) right now we just copy and paste minified (or not minified) JS into plugins.js
[10:13:29] <ajpiano> luckily for us that all still runs through uglify ok
[10:13:54] <ajpiano> but i think realistically the "right" approach is to switch to having the unminifed version of those plugins in their own dir
[10:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can just include our own.
[10:14:00] <ajpiano> and have the build process take care of the concat/min
[10:14:03] <ajpiano> awesome
[10:14:09] <ajpiano> yeah, i'd much prefer to
[10:14:16] <kswedberg> +1 for including jQuery in concatted js
[10:14:24] <ajpiano> like, i really don't think JS cdns are the bees knees
[10:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, now that we have a build process, 3rd party scripts should be in their own directory.
[10:14:40] <ajpiano> so some people might be like OMG why aren't YOU GUYS PRIMING OUR CACHES with sweet sweet jqueries
[10:14:45] <ajpiano> and i'd rather have us be the example of
[10:14:53] <ajpiano> concat and min your code, cut down your requests
[10:15:14] <ajpiano> great, so i will just break apart the scripts, and include jquery and jquery-migrate in there
[10:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> This is a fairly complex discussion though.
[10:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> There's no right answer.
[10:15:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: granted
[10:15:27] <ajpiano> yeah, i agree
[10:15:29] <ajpiano> it depends on a lot of stuff
[10:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> concat to single file isn't always the best either.
[10:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> But we should continue to do it, at least for now.
[10:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> continue = start :-P
[10:16:18] <ajpiano> i just look at http://gyazo.com/ce0234db33d65e9e1b9e51c188e51bdc
[10:16:21] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:16:35] <ajpiano> eventually maybe it makes the most sense to have like two scripts
[10:16:52] <ajpiano> 3rd party stuff, and then site stuff
[10:17:04] <ajpiano> though i guess a philosophical question is, on jquery.com, is jquery itself a 3rd party script ;)
[10:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:17:27] <ajpiano> but we'll cross that bridge at such time that we approach it
[10:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> That's not the way to split the files though.
[10:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> The split is based on either frequency of updates or # of pages that utilize the script.
[10:17:54] <ajpiano> ah yeah
[10:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> For now, single script is the way to go.
[10:18:30] <ajpiano> amena
[10:18:59] <ajpiano> oh also
[10:19:13] <ajpiano> klein and i made a bunch of progress last night on improving the navigation on mobile
[10:19:14] <ajpiano> https://github.com/kleinmaetschke/jquery-wp-content/commits/204-Select-element-navigation-on-mobile
[10:19:40] <ajpiano> that'll probably be PR tonight
[10:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[10:22:19] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/3D1k3n2w061g http://cl.ly/image/3z0Y411u0y3M
[10:22:28] <ajpiano> still needs tightening etc
[10:22:47] <ajpiano> but basically it takes the very top level nav and moves it to the footer, as it's really weird to have a <select> be the very first item on the web page
[10:23:01] <ajpiano> and it also collapses the nav#main into a select
[10:23:14] <ajpiano> any objections to that approach?
[10:24:01] <ajpiano> kswedberg: what are you correcting them too*
[10:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> Seems good
[10:24:27] <ajpiano> them to
[10:24:28] <ajpiano> :/
[10:25:15] <kswedberg> ajpiano: they're currently in there as  type="foo,bar,baz" but they should be in as <type name="foo"/> <type name="bar"/> etc.
[10:25:20] <ajpiano> ah ok
[10:25:23] <ajpiano> in the xml
[10:25:28] <kswedberg> yessir
[10:25:42] <ajpiano> sounds good
[10:25:56] <kswedberg> also, I was wondering if we should have a type for "HTMLString" or some such, like we have one for "Selector"
[10:26:12] <ajpiano> not sure
[10:26:28] <ajpiano> considering the recent new semantics we've put around what is an ok html string for $() vs $.parseHTML
[10:26:30] <ajpiano> seems like a good idea
[10:26:51] <kswedberg> that way in the /Types/ page, we can spell out what is ok.
[10:27:23] <kswedberg> and all args of that type will link to it
[10:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> +1
[10:28:17] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: that's all the +1s I need. :)
[10:29:09] <ajpiano> right on
[10:30:11] <ajpiano> okey
[10:30:16] <ajpiano> i don't have anything else right this second
[10:30:32] <agcolom> I do.
[10:30:36] <ajpiano> wassup agcolom
[10:31:23] <agcolom> currently, in api.jquerymobile.com events are not XXXX like methods
[10:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> XXXX?
[10:31:42] <agcolom> XXX is a missing word! described or
[10:31:46] <ajpiano> they are not SHIT like methods!!!!!
[10:31:54] <agcolom> I know!
[10:32:01] <agcolom> it's the Xslt
[10:32:24] <agcolom> sorry that word is not coming to me right now!
[10:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Perhaps a screenshot of what methods are that events aren't? :-)
[10:32:53] <agcolom> so we can't have examples n events
[10:33:09] <agcolom> in ^
[10:33:51] <agcolom> events cannot be documented with teh same styling as methods
[10:34:08] <agcolom> that's it! (sorry had a brain freeze!)
[10:34:50] <agcolom> we created an issue about it at the summit in DC
[10:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You mean like http://api.jquery.com/parent-selector/ ?
[10:35:30] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes
[10:36:33] <rworth> hey
[10:36:52] <agcolom> hey rworth !
[10:39:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I guess the xslt file needs modifying ?
[10:40:01] <agcolom> (so that it will for example pick up event examples to create iframes, etc.)
[10:40:30] <agcolom> And then I have a question regarding tagging...
[10:41:17] <agcolom> As scott_gonzalez mentioned before, I agree that it's a good idea to keep the api docs tag inline with the version of JQM
[10:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yes, there needs to be a template for events.
[10:42:16] <agcolom> how many digits can we use? (so to stay inline with 1.3.0, can we use 1.3.0.0 then 1.3.0.1, etc ?
[10:43:32] <agcolom> template for events: ok. how do we go about it? Is that something you can do for me? or should I do it?
[10:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: 1.3.0-1
[10:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see my email about deploying sites?
[10:44:45] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: did you send it today?
[10:44:58] <agcolom> 1.3.0-1 sounds good. Thank you
[10:46:00] <rworth> he sent it Jan 24
[10:46:12] <agcolom> yes, just checked and I have got it
[10:46:18] <agcolom> yes Jan 24
[10:48:40] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I'd like to try to tag and deploy sometime nexxt week. As it will be my 1st time, I'd like ot do that when you're around if that's ok with you... So should I just try to catch you one evening (GMT)?
[10:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's a very simple process :-)
[10:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> But I'll be around if you need help or have any questions.
[10:50:58] <agcolom> thank you.
[11:02:54] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:03:07] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:03:14] <toddmparker> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17nll3sHiMnP2HP5hK2E40HYPpdBI3FjkBS4BTT4ldlc/edit
[11:03:18] <toddmparker> starting in 1 minute...
[11:03:36] <arschmitz> Hi all
[11:03:44] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:04:44] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[11:04:50] <arschmitz> I'm not filling out agenda today because I'm on my phone lol
[11:05:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: UNFORGIVABLE!
[11:05:13] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:05:33] <arschmitz> Fine!
[11:05:49] <toddmparker> shocked you're here arschmitz
[11:05:51] <toddmparker> congrats again
[11:05:54] <uGoMobi> me too
[11:06:35] <gseguin> hiya
[11:06:42] <gseguin> Congrats arschmitz!
[11:07:26] <toddmparker> hey all
[11:07:39] <toddmparker> ok, so the big news (other than arschmitz's)
[11:07:41] <toddmparker> 1.3.0 RC1 went out on Monday as scheduled: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/02/04/jquery-mobile-1-3-0-rc1-released/
[11:07:53] <_|Nix|_> \o/
[11:07:56] <toddmparker> seems very solid, getting very few issues
[11:08:07] <toddmparker> probably because nobody tests RC's
[11:08:35] <toddmparker> We’ve had two issues come in that needed to be fixed for final:
[11:08:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, I've had a doozie ... good think that got shaken loose.
[11:08:36] <toddmparker> 5593 - hidden form elements that were added for focus management in popups were being added in other situations. Fixed in master
[11:08:37] <toddmparker> 5588 - Panels: make sure active state is applied to and removed from buttons in header too. Fixed in master.
[11:08:47] <toddmparker> yeah, really
[11:08:56] <toddmparker> that's what RCs are for
[11:09:26] <toddmparker> so i want to give people a few more days to test so we'll see where we are next week
[11:09:48] <toddmparker> think those two fixes are small enough to not warrant another RC but if more fixes have to land, we'll need to re-assess
[11:10:30] <toddmparker> thinking monday the 18th might be a good target for final - thoughts?
[11:10:52] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[11:11:01] <arschmitz> Sounds good
[11:11:03] <uGoMobi> +1
[11:11:09] <toddmparker> cool
[11:11:11] <_|Nix|_> That gives lots of time for shakedown.
[11:11:12] <agcolom> +1
[11:11:14] <gseguin> +1
[11:11:31] <toddmparker> I'd like to make the switch to the new docs, API sites official with that release
[11:11:54] <toddmparker> what's the situation with the servers?
[11:12:08] <toddmparker> we were discussing switching over to new domains and servers...
[11:12:20] <toddmparker> now is the time to do that
[11:12:40] <toddmparker> arschmitz: were you looking at that?
[11:12:41] <johnbender> gnarf: ^
[11:12:44] <arschmitz> Not sure it's ready
[11:12:54] <agcolom> I'll liaise with scott_gonzalez next week to learn how to tag and deploy
[11:13:01] <arschmitz> Gnarf was talking with release of jquerymobile.com
[11:13:02] <toddmparker> should johnbender take point now that you are going to be…preoccupied?
[11:13:18] <toddmparker> agcolom: great
[11:13:27] <johnbender> arschmitz: I certainly can
[11:13:32] <johnbender> thinks are slow internally this week
[11:13:32] <toddmparker> to switch to view.jquerymobile.com
[11:13:41] <johnbender> s/thinks/things/
[11:13:50] <toddmparker> great. can't hurt to have you both looking at it
[11:13:55] <toddmparker> lots of moving pieces
[11:14:15] <uGoMobi> do we want redirects for each old docs page?
[11:14:18] <arschmitz> Ill still be around so either way always happy to have someone else helping though lol
[11:14:21] <gnarf> we can switch to the new stuff whenever your stuff works properly on stage.jquerymobile.com and stage.api.jquerymobile.com
[11:14:27] <toddmparker> my understanding is that we just want to switch to the new urls to match core and UI
[11:14:33] <uGoMobi> or all redirecting to new docs homepage?
[11:14:55] <arschmitz> It's also to fix issue with proxy 502
[11:15:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: that would be ideal, but it's going to be a lot of work to map things
[11:15:11] <agcolom> and we want some text for the landing page
[11:15:12] <arschmitz> Though gnarf was looking into a temp fix for that yesterday
[11:15:14] <toddmparker> some old pages don't' have a home anymore
[11:15:29] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:16:00] <toddmparker> gnarf: what are the next steps for us?
[11:16:01] <uGoMobi> or maybe a landing page that tells people what went where
[11:16:52] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah. we could re-direct all links to /test/ to a landing page that explains there is a new api and demo site with links to each?
[11:16:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Not a bad idea
[11:16:57] <johnbender> toddmparker: it looks like stage.jquerymobile.com needs some love :()
[11:16:58] <johnbender> :)
[11:17:21] <toddmparker> ah, the site? yes. think RWhitbeck was looking at porting our content over
[11:17:33] <toddmparker> it's a very old snapshot of content
[11:17:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi: arschmitz: toddmparker: what is replacing test?
[11:17:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes that's what I thought
[11:17:43] <johnbender> the demos?
[11:17:48] <toddmparker> yes
[11:17:55] <johnbender> so why do we need a redirect?
[11:18:13] <johnbender> just need to change the proxy to the swarm server right?
[11:18:15] <toddmparker> because there are a ton of links to /test/ so we want to at least not have them 404
[11:18:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: ah
[11:18:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: Gnarf wants us to go to a view. Jquery.com type setup
[11:18:31] <johnbender> because the docs are changing to the demos
[11:18:32] <johnbender> got it
[11:18:35] <toddmparker> the old /test/ is a combo demo and docs
[11:18:42] <johnbender> word
[11:18:46] <toddmparker> most of the content now lives on api.jqm.com
[11:19:03] <toddmparker> the more demo-y stuff lives in that new demo folder
[11:19:03] <johnbender> couldn't we do a redirect from all sub urls at /test/ to the demos site?
[11:19:06] <johnbender> view.jqm.com?
[11:19:16] <johnbender> or wherever
[11:19:27] <toddmparker> yeah, that could work too
[11:19:43] <toddmparker> we can add a note about the new api site there on the demos homepage
[11:19:43] <johnbender> toddmparker: so where is it supposed to go?
[11:19:47] <johnbender> where is the new demos/docs
[11:19:50] <johnbender> where are
[11:20:00] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[11:20:18] <toddmparker> ^^ we have a /demos/ folder inside docs right now as a temporary way to work
[11:20:28] <uGoMobi> that subfolder /demos/ is temporarly
[11:20:31] <toddmparker> we can move demos up a level
[11:20:37] <toddmparker> and delete /docs/
[11:20:43] <toddmparker> when we switch
[11:21:01] <toddmparker> (this is from a repo perspective)
[11:21:07] <uGoMobi> yes, rename the folder /docs/ to /demos/ in the repo
[11:21:17] <toddmparker> right
[11:21:27] <gnarf> we generate our demos on jqueryui.com from the jquery-ui repo too
[11:21:29] <gseguin> and get rid of the docs part?
[11:21:37] <toddmparker> and all these old docs pages can be deleted: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/
[11:21:45] <gseguin> ok
[11:21:50] <toddmparker> gnarf: right, same idea
[11:21:52] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L96
[11:22:24] <toddmparker> gseguin: yeah, we're fining a new home or re-writing all the old docs and either putting it on the API site or demos
[11:22:40] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:22:42] * agcolom is about to have dinner so will be back in 15/20 min... is that ok?
[11:22:53] <johnbender> agcolom: sure
[11:23:06] <toddmparker> demos has much less "docs" kinda stuff. it's all examples for copy/paste
[11:23:11] <gnarf> are you guys waiting on websites for 1.3 release?
[11:23:12] <toddmparker> agcolom: sure
[11:23:18] <agcolom> thx :-)
[11:23:40] <toddmparker> we were hoping to re-launch our website for 1.3 and RWhitbeck is working on it
[11:23:51] <toddmparker> the blog is more complicated
[11:23:59] <toddmparker> i need to follow up on that
[11:24:12] <toddmparker> there will be an uber blog across projects but that will take some time
[11:24:21] <toddmparker> so we may need to do something UI did
[11:26:56] <toddmparker> so for URLS...
[11:27:25] <toddmparker> jquerymobile.com/test/ will now be view.jquerymobile.com and be mapped to the new demos. That right?
[11:28:16] <arschmitz> Right that's what we talked about
[11:28:53] <toddmparker> and for branch previews?
[11:29:04] <gnarf> view.* has branch support
[11:29:33] <toddmparker> jquerymobile.com/branches/ will now be view.jquerymobile.com/branchname
[11:29:38] <toddmparker> that right gnarf?
[11:30:07] <toddmparker> is there a branch listing page or do you just need to know the branch name and enter it into the URL?
[11:30:11] <gnarf> thats the thought
[11:30:22] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/
[11:30:40] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[11:31:21] <toddmparker> so /test/ (our live master view) would be view.jquerymobile.com/master ?
[11:31:55] <gnarf> yeah
[11:32:08] <gnarf> or even /master/demos
[11:32:12] <toddmparker> cool
[11:32:15] <gnarf> if thats what /test links too now
[11:32:23] <toddmparker> think that URL scheme is a lot clearer than /test/
[11:32:29] <toddmparker> yeah, it does
[11:33:07] <toddmparker> guess we could set up shortcuts to that too
[11:33:17] <uGoMobi> should we redirect jquerymobile.com/test/ to view.jquerymobile.com or view/jquerymobile.com/master/demos/
[11:33:36] <uGoMobi> view.
[11:33:56] <toddmparker> yes, I think so
[11:34:11] <arschmitz> We have an index in root so just view.jquerymobile.com/master
[11:34:31] <toddmparker> ah, right
[11:34:55] <toddmparker> the demos folder will go up two levels basically
[11:35:00] <uGoMobi> ah our index redirects to /demos/
[11:35:07] <arschmitz> Yup
[11:35:16] <toddmparker> ok, that seems clear
[11:35:30] <toddmparker> gnarf: how do the logistics work with this?
[11:36:01] <toddmparker> if we wanted to cut over when we hit final, say on the 18th, is that reasonable to set this stuff up by then?
[11:36:42] <gnarf> yeah, i can get the view. stuff working today or tomorrow hopefully, i'd be much more concerned about the other websites
[11:36:57] <gseguin> tne demos should be picked up from dist/demos
[11:36:57] <gnarf> might wanna cc scott_gonzalez on his checklist he had for 1.9 release
[11:36:57] <toddmparker> which ones?
[11:37:02] <gnarf> thats when we did the big switch
[11:37:08] <toddmparker> ah, cool
[11:37:13] <gseguin> once I merge the grunt-0.4 branch
[11:37:16] <gnarf> toddmparker: like to the new jquerymobile.com / api.jquerymobile.com
[11:37:25] <toddmparker> arschmitz and johnbender can ask him for that
[11:37:36] <toddmparker> API is already up and launched really
[11:37:54] <gseguin> we don't want to have the PHP concat for the demos
[11:37:57] <arschmitz> No prob
[11:37:59] <toddmparker> agcolom needs to know how to tag that when we release but it's otherwise in good shape
[11:38:12] <gnarf> just making sure that all the stuff works like it should there is going to be pretty important
[11:38:46] <toddmparker> heck yeah
[11:39:05] <toddmparker> if we can set things up ahead of time so we can test, that's ideal
[11:39:15] <gnarf> stage. is there for that yeah?
[11:39:23] <gnarf> i'll work on view
[11:39:34] <arschmitz> Thanks gnarf
[11:39:34] <gnarf> and add the redirect from /test/* to view.*/master/$1
[11:39:34] <toddmparker> for example, could we run both the current /test/ and the new view.jQuery Mobile at the same time?
[11:39:36] <gseguin> That's happening after 1.3, right?
[11:40:14] <toddmparker> be good to add that redirect at final, not right this sec
[11:40:21] <gnarf> the redirect when i put it in will only be there for stage.jquerymobile.com until we make jquerymobile.com live
[11:40:36] <toddmparker> ok
[11:40:55] <toddmparker> i'll find out the deal with the site
[11:41:09] <johnbender> gnarf === the king
[11:41:17] <toddmparker> be great to have this view system. the one setup for us was…less than optimal
[11:41:21] <toddmparker> thanks gnarf
[11:41:56] <toddmparker> ok, that's in on 1.3 I think…anything else there?
[11:42:15] <uGoMobi> we need to look at the navmenu
[11:42:23] <toddmparker> for demos?
[11:42:26] <uGoMobi> the php include
[11:42:28] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:42:32] <arschmitz> Need a solution for links
[11:42:43] <toddmparker> yeah. the link paths are wrong at certain levels
[11:42:47] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:42:52] * agcolom is back...
[11:43:08] <uGoMobi> we can fix that with php
[11:43:08] <toddmparker> if index is / could we use urls like /index.html?
[11:43:14] <toddmparker> ah, cool
[11:43:23] <toddmparker> hi agcolom
[11:43:37] <uGoMobi> but not sure how it works with the build
[11:43:40] <agcolom> hi!
[11:43:48] <uGoMobi> there we want no php but only html
[11:43:56] <uGoMobi> in the zip i mean
[11:43:56] <toddmparker> we were coordinating on 1.3 - shooting to officially launch the new demos and API then, Monday the 18th is the goal
[11:44:03] <arschmitz> Panel won't work in build for 1.3
[11:44:06] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: true
[11:44:27] <gseguin> uGoMobi: that is the case now in grunt-0.4
[11:44:29] <toddmparker> so do we hide the pane button and just make people go home?
[11:44:34] <arschmitz> Not until grunt .
[11:44:36] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:44:38] <arschmitz> 4
[11:45:15] <toddmparker> agcolom: that seem like a workable schedule for you?
[11:45:27] <gseguin> I replaced all the php includes by the content of the included files at build time
[11:45:41] <toddmparker> cool gseguin
[11:45:53] <toddmparker> so includes get complied into the pages
[11:45:57] <agcolom> yes, so what do I need to do exactly (just to be sure)
[11:45:59] <gseguin> that's right
[11:46:09] <uGoMobi> right, but if we use a php function to fix the relative path at different levels
[11:46:10] <gseguin> no more PHP in the zip file
[11:46:24] <uGoMobi> then that won't work in the zip
[11:46:27] <toddmparker> agcolom: just have the content in shape and know how to tag it as 1.3.0 final so you can do that when we release the code
[11:46:38] <agcolom> ok, so yes
[11:46:42] <toddmparker> cool
[11:47:21] <uGoMobi> well, we will think of some sort of fallback so it's still functional in the zip
[11:47:21] <toddmparker> we can figure out this php thing in -dev
[11:47:26] <toddmparker> +1
[11:47:27] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:47:34] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:47:43] <toddmparker> 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 maintenance releases coming - Since it’s a small release, we’re not doing an RC which is what core has switched to doing.
[11:47:58] <toddmparker> i'll update the docs in each branch
[11:48:07] <toddmparker> and johnbender can do a deploy
[11:48:16] <toddmparker> i'll get the blog posts written very soon
[11:48:25] <gseguin> and then we close 1.1-stable
[11:48:30] <uGoMobi> do we have to test them against new core versions?
[11:48:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no
[11:48:36] <toddmparker> not doing an rc speeds things up quite a bit
[11:48:38] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:48:40] <agcolom> the only thing that I'm a bit worried about is the tons of iframes we've got in the api docs for widgets... My computer & internet connection are a bit slow so it takes a few seconds to load each page. What is it like for you?(The worst page is buttons)
[11:48:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: not sure we want to go there if it adds complexity
[11:49:06] <toddmparker> opinions there?
[11:49:12] <toddmparker> definitely not for 1.1.2
[11:49:24] <toddmparker> agcolom: yeah, they are heavy
[11:49:37] <uGoMobi> 1.2.1 doesn't work with core 1.9 right
[11:49:39] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:49:39] <toddmparker> we can look at reducing some of them if it's trouble
[11:49:45] <uGoMobi> do we test against 1.8.3?
[11:50:03] <uGoMobi> I think when we released 1.2.0 core 1.8.2 was latest
[11:50:17] <toddmparker> i think we should have each version support the latest dot release
[11:50:22] <agcolom> but then I think the iframes provide a good illustration... so yes, maybe we can see what the community says...
[11:50:36] <toddmparker> so if 1.8.2 was at 1.2.0, we support up to 1.8.3
[11:50:42] <toddmparker> agcolom: right
[11:51:00] <toddmparker> 1.9 had enough changes that I can see that getting difficult
[11:51:13] <uGoMobi> 1.8.3 sounds good for 1.2.1
[11:51:13] <toddmparker> rather ship out some fixes
[11:51:16] <toddmparker> cool
[11:51:21] <uGoMobi> I agree
[11:51:30] <toddmparker> might be the same for 1.1.2
[11:51:52] <toddmparker> that's it for logistics, sorry that took so long
[11:52:09] <toddmparker> agcolom: what's your update?
[11:52:13] <arschmitz> A lot to discuss
[11:52:34] <agcolom> ok, updated CDN in api docs to 1.3 beta
[11:52:47] <toddmparker> great
[11:52:48] <agcolom> (so need to update again to rc1 but that's easy ;-) )
[11:53:13] <agcolom>     here’s the api docs status: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vo_O-GVATYLbo1WggLjlGAQGuFzwE3fUP_8ZR7aftE0/edit
[11:53:13] <agcolom>     Created entries for:
[11:53:13] <agcolom>         Page Initialization events
[11:53:13] <agcolom>         Page change events
[11:53:13] <agcolom>         Page scroll events
[11:53:14] <agcolom>         page load events
[11:53:14] <agcolom>         Page transition events
[11:53:15] <agcolom>         so all events are now covered!!!!
[11:53:15] <agcolom>     Added a clarification note for RWD tables
[11:53:37] <toddmparker> great progress…all events. hurrah!
[11:54:01] <agcolom> Thinking of adding icons and configurable options to guides & references
[11:54:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: I can do my update if you want
[11:54:14] <johnbender> update
[11:54:14] <johnbender> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/navigation/
[11:54:14] <johnbender> demos for the new nav stuff
[11:54:14] <johnbender> got the basetag branch updated and working
[11:54:14] <johnbender> it's ready to merge when we release 1.3
[11:54:14] <johnbender> that's it
[11:54:18] <toddmparker> that would be great
[11:54:46] <toddmparker> i linked that up to the panel nag last night johnbender
[11:54:51] <toddmparker> good stuff
[11:55:07] <toddmparker> good news on the base tag stuff. fully hydrated, eh?
[11:55:17] <johnbender> yes
[11:55:21] <johnbender> just needs to be lived wtih
[11:55:34] <johnbender> so we can find the relative image problems that scott was talking about if they exist
[11:56:58] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[11:57:05] <toddmparker> thanks johnbender
[11:57:26] <toddmparker> who wants to go next?
[11:57:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz ?
[11:58:13] <_|Nix|_> Sure, I can go.
[11:58:31] <_|Nix|_> Fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5590 at the same time (same root cause).
[11:58:32] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5593 by jaxtrx (1d 18h 17m 13s): ShowStopper - click on Form Fields adds hidden fields if 'name' attribute set
[11:58:40] <toddmparker> whew
[11:58:44] <_|Nix|_> Got rid of the whole hidden input thing after discussing it in core.
[11:58:57] <toddmparker> found a better way
[11:59:25] <_|Nix|_> Worked on the popup arrows. They're pretty much working, except on iOS 5 which I gotta figure out using my new-found browserstack-fu.
[11:59:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that might have fixed another old issue then... will look it up
[11:59:45] <_|Nix|_> Went through the process of getting api.jquerymobile.com deployed locally.
[11:59:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Please.
[12:00:01] <_|Nix|_> The more bugs I can fix in one shot, the better.
[12:00:22] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:00:30] <gseguin> I have to drop off soon, I'll turn off the lights when I get back
[12:00:43] <_|Nix|_> Working on creating the arrows without specifying quite so decimal values (like left: 3.1345529px; )
[12:00:57] <_|Nix|_> s/quite so/quite so many/
[12:01:09] <toddmparker> it's a cool extension for sure
[12:01:14] <_|Nix|_> Basically I need to center a square inside another square.
[12:01:42] <_|Nix|_> ... and I'm not sure if the margin: auto; trick works for things that are positioned relative, absolute, that kind of stuff.
[12:01:43] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Sorry, no results for ‟site:developer.mozilla.org not sure if the margin: auto; trick works for things that are positioned relative, absolute, that kind of stuff.”.
[12:02:00] <_|Nix|_> WTF was that? O_o
[12:02:23] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: maybe uGoMobi or wilto can help you with CSS wizardry
[12:02:31] <_|Nix|_> Maybe so.
[12:02:50] <_|Nix|_> There is another issue.
[12:03:03] <_|Nix|_> The arrows introduce quite a bit of themeing.
[12:03:16] <toddmparker> yeah, might be better to recommend flat colors
[12:03:34] <_|Nix|_> Basically, you need to choose the height of the arrow, and then calculate corresponding widths, heights, lefts, tops, rights, and bottoms throughout the theme section of arrows.
[12:03:48] <toddmparker> eesh
[12:03:55] <uGoMobi> sounds complex
[12:04:25] <toddmparker> well, we can help you chip away at this
[12:04:36] <toddmparker> good you got set up for the API docs too, nice
[12:04:47] <uGoMobi> sure, I can help with the CSS if you want _|Nix|_
[12:05:03] <uGoMobi> Re: hidden input https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721
[12:05:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: want to go?
[12:05:04] <_|Nix|_> You can judge for yourself: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/popup-arrow/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css#L1158
[12:05:05] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #3721 by jsm174 (11mon 1w 3h 7m 31s): Multiple buttons with type=submit and same name, serialize incorrectly on second submit
[12:05:12] <toddmparker> (seeing we're already over)
[12:05:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sure
[12:05:26] <uGoMobi> fixed panel issues:
[12:05:26] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5510 - opening a panel when there is already an open panel on the page: we now wait with opening the second until the first has been closed
[12:05:27] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5510 by uGoMobi (2w 2d 7h 56m 34s): Opening a panel while another panel is already open
[12:05:36] <uGoMobi> that was before RC
[12:05:53] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5583 - buttons in header active state not applied or removed
[12:05:53] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5583 by mhemesath (2d 17h 35m 7s): Header buttons dont' unfocus when opening/closing a panel.
[12:06:00] <uGoMobi> after RC
[12:06:07] <toddmparker> you landed a fix for that - after RC
[12:06:17] <toddmparker> yep. so we have two fixes post-RC
[12:06:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll check https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721 ...
[12:06:22] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #3721 by jsm174 (11mon 1w 3h 8m 49s): Multiple buttons with type=submit and same name, serialize incorrectly on second submit
[12:06:36] <toddmparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[12:06:48] <uGoMobi> one note about 5583: the issue was caused by buttons in header not getting data-role="button"
[12:07:01] <uGoMobi> I think we need to fix that in 1.4
[12:07:03] <toddmparker> right, like how you fixed it in the content
[12:07:46] <uGoMobi> fixed TR markup for 1.3
[12:07:48] <toddmparker> we were applying the active class to links that weren't buttons
[12:08:01] <toddmparker> thank you for that TR stuff
[12:08:06] <uGoMobi> yes, so I fixed that
[12:08:27] <uGoMobi> but a regression was that buttons in headers didn't get the active state or it wasn't removed
[12:08:33] <toddmparker> did you get a phone at BBJam?
[12:08:40] <uGoMobi> nope
[12:08:45] <toddmparker> d'oh
[12:08:52] <arschmitz> Bummer
[12:09:00] <uGoMobi> been to BBJam Europe with RWhitbeck and JasonDScott___
[12:09:06] <uGoMobi> was cool event
[12:09:09] <toddmparker> i'll see if i can distribute my beta devices at some point
[12:09:17] <uGoMobi> promoted JQM of course :)
[12:09:25] <toddmparker> good buzz on the theme
[12:10:12] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[12:10:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I made someone at BBJam happy with your iOS swipe fix
[12:10:57] <arschmitz> Nice!
[12:11:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: - i'll jot notes in for you…go for it
[12:11:43] <arschmitz> Had son lol
[12:11:51] <uGoMobi> yeahhh
[12:11:57] <toddmparker> noted.
[12:11:58] <arschmitz> Wrote all faqs in page section
[12:12:29] <arschmitz> Made deep links for docs until we can merge real fix after 1.3
[12:12:51] <arschmitz> Working on h2 widget
[12:13:10] <arschmitz> Talked with scott_gonzalez on bringing in ui core
[12:13:19] <arschmitz> Started initial work planning
[12:14:39] <arschmitz> Worked with gnarf ryanneufeld on 502 and view. Idea
[12:14:41] <toddmparker> I asked arschmitz to take point on coordinating with scott_gonzalez on core and widget factory compliance
[12:15:12] <_|Nix|_> +1
[12:15:20] <arschmitz> I think that hits the major points lol
[12:15:40] <toddmparker> everyone will be involved in that stuff btw, just wanted to get the ball rolling
[12:15:58] <toddmparker> thanks arschmitz - still amazed you're here :)
[12:16:10] <arschmitz> Ha ha wife needs rest!
[12:16:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you might need some rest too :)
[12:16:56] <arschmitz> Lol yea maybe later lol
[12:16:57] <toddmparker> i'll be on a 6hr flight so i'll keep plugging away at demos
[12:17:25] <arschmitz> Hoping to finish h2 widget tonight so it will be in demos for 1.3
[12:17:39] <toddmparker> in the demos, should we switch to local fonts so the pages look ok offline?
[12:17:49] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that would be really great
[12:18:02] <toddmparker> let me know how to prep the pages to make it easy to drop it in
[12:18:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: there is fallback to sans-serif
[12:18:14] <toddmparker> yeah, true
[12:18:23] <uGoMobi> should be fine
[12:18:24] <toddmparker> but it won't be so pretty :)
[12:18:30] <toddmparker> it's fine
[12:18:31] <arschmitz> Oh on that what do we thing generate whole panel or just panel content?
[12:18:53] <toddmparker> i think it maybe should generate the panel + contents and add the button too
[12:19:09] <arschmitz> Sounds like a plan
[12:19:11] <toddmparker> if we need js to show it
[12:19:11] <uGoMobi> but the panel get unique id
[12:19:35] <uGoMobi> so the panel container shouldn't be generated maybe
[12:19:38] <arschmitz> Yeah
[12:20:11] <toddmparker> was thinking that having the empty panel might be odd w/o JS?
[12:20:18] <arschmitz> We will be bringing in unique I'd function from ui soon so can port it temp for panel generation
[12:20:19] <toddmparker> well, the link esp.
[12:20:27] <toddmparker> but we can do whatever is easy
[12:20:53] <toddmparker> yeah, the id needs to be unique but it can be just a random string really
[12:21:02] <uGoMobi> true
[12:21:12] <toddmparker> the id's for the h2's are going to be generated?
[12:21:18] <arschmitz> Yes
[12:21:23] <uGoMobi> great
[12:21:38] <toddmparker> Icon Position >> id="uniqueprefix-icon-position"
[12:21:50] <toddmparker> super
[12:22:07] <toddmparker> useful little tool
[12:22:42] <toddmparker> arschmitz: we can comment out Q&A's that aren't written quite yet.
[12:22:51] <toddmparker> I'll make some from items in the old docs tonight
[12:23:19] <toddmparker> encourage people to write 'em too
[12:23:30] <arschmitz> Yea I'm going to plug away on those to try and finish before Monday
[12:23:30] <toddmparker> got one from max lynch from codiqa
[12:23:42] <toddmparker> be cool if these were community generated
[12:23:54] <toddmparker> no worries if we need to add more later
[12:23:55] <arschmitz> Yeah I had already written that one lol :( but I like his
[12:24:06] <arschmitz> Teaches me for not merging in timely fashion
[12:24:07] <toddmparker> it's a nice format. can be short.
[12:24:25] <uGoMobi> maybe we can add a "download template" button somewhere
[12:24:39] <uGoMobi> action button to encourage :)
[12:24:47] <arschmitz> Good idea
[12:25:00] <uGoMobi> jquerymobile.com/contribute
[12:25:41] <toddmparker> I like that idea
[12:25:56] <toddmparker> if we had a template, we can link it up from that Q&A page
[12:26:07] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:26:19] <uGoMobi> we can make a clean template file
[12:26:31] <toddmparker> template = a page in GH with instructions to do a PR
[12:26:33] <uGoMobi> with some comments in it with instructions
[12:26:37] <toddmparker> nice
[12:27:09] <uGoMobi> yes, we should include PR instructions
[12:27:13] <toddmparker> like that. when i asked a few people to write 'em, that's what they asked for
[12:27:23] <uGoMobi> ok noted
[12:27:38] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: want to make a template + instructions and i'll add that to the Q&A page?
[12:27:46] <uGoMobi> yes
