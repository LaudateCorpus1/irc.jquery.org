[14:09:03] <arschmitz> cogwurx: apsdehal: sfrisk:
[14:09:09] <sfrisk> allo
[14:09:12] <cogwurx> I'm here!
[14:09:23] <apsdehal> Hey
[14:09:53] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:10:06] <arschmitz> apsdehal: You were working on the api
[14:10:10] <apsdehal> Should we update the log btw?
[14:10:17] <arschmitz> yes
[14:10:26] <arschmitz> we have not been doing it and we should
[14:11:04] <apsdehal> I am mostly done with api, I will open up PR within half an hour
[14:11:13] <arschmitz> execlent
[14:12:05] <arschmitz> once that lands we can publish the last bits and work on any issues to fix for beta
[14:12:48] <arschmitz> apsdehal: you had started on a list of beta issues last week right?
[14:14:15] <apsdehal> No, I found only one or two at the moment, I didn't get much time after that
[14:14:40] <apsdehal> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=1502363897
[14:20:05] <apsdehal> So should we mention both jquery and ui version in main page of api documentation?
[14:20:35] <arschmitz> ui will be fixed version
[14:21:03] <arschmitz> because it the version we are using im not sure the best way to document this since we dont want people including full ui only pieces not already included
[14:21:16] <arschmitz> we might need a special section in the api for it or something
[14:21:38] <arschmitz> and its not a dependency the user needs to worry about unless adding more of ui
[14:21:46] <apsdehal> jQuery Mobile 1.5	supports jQuery 2.2 and newer and uses  jQuery UI 1.12?
[14:21:58] <arschmitz> sure
[14:29:11] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/402
[14:29:18] <apsdehal> arschmitz ^
[14:29:39] <arschmitz> execlent ill review before the end of the day
[14:29:59] <arschmitz> is there anything else?
[14:30:27] <apsdehal> I tested the basic infrastructure and errors  on the local vagrant and it is working
[14:34:46] <apsdehal> For the local it is showing 1.5 in the main page but it is showing widget information from older 1.4
[14:34:48] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:34:55] <apsdehal> I am not sure how to link the latest tag to main page
[14:35:02] <arschmitz> ill look
[14:35:10] <apsdehal> So that main page points to 1.5 and 1.4 points to 1.4 tag
[14:40:54] <arschmitz> ok'
[14:52:34] <arschmitz> ok guess thats it for today
