[09:01:13] <timmywil> m_gol, arthurvr, gibson042, markelog, DaveMethvin|away meeting time
[09:01:16] <arthurvr> hey
[09:01:16] <m_gol> present
[09:01:25] <timmywil> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BadwSO6Sn91RBfr05s77r81ncEi0oMBJ5mZS-k215vg/edit#
[09:01:29] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:03:47] <timmywil> First, we got a couple events issues I'm inclined to close, but wanted to make sure that was consensus.
[09:03:51] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2387
[09:04:14] <timmywil> This issue sounds really familiar
[09:04:30] <m_gol> Yeah, I think I saw it before
[09:04:31] <timmywil> ignoring duplicate listeners
[09:04:58] <gibson042> I'm in favor of closing
[09:05:22] <timmywil> What's a good reason I can put in the comment when closing?
[09:05:29] <gibson042> backcompat
[09:05:53] <timmywil> yea, that seems to be the only one I can think of.
[09:06:03] <gibson042> I mean, there's actually reason to do it
[09:06:19] <gibson042> but the cases where it comes up are rare
[09:06:34] <gibson042> and probably equally likely to go in either direction (dedupe or not)
[09:06:44] <gibson042> _not_ deduping makes our code simpler
[09:06:50] <gibson042> and it can be handled by user code
[09:08:08] <markelog> how about we ask, what is use-case for that behaviour?
[09:08:13] <markelog> maybe there is something we don't see?
[09:09:29] <timmywil> I just closed
[09:09:58] <timmywil> I'm sure the OP will come back with a rebutal if they feel strongly
[09:10:06] <markelog> okay
[09:10:22] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2388 (priority in event handlers)
[09:10:34] <markelog> тщ!
[09:10:35] <markelog> no!
[09:10:37] <markelog> no-no
[09:11:01] <timmywil> This is something that could be added without breaking back-compat, but it seems to me that it would be underused and misused.
[09:11:14] <markelog> z-index problem
[09:11:16] <m_gol> the on signature would turn from ugly to super ugly if we put in more params
[09:11:23] <markelog> $( "div" ).on( "click", "a", data, handler, 999999999 );
[09:11:26] <markelog> and such
[09:11:40] <markelog> and four arguments?
[09:12:00] <m_gol> markelog: that would be 5 :)
[09:12:15] <markelog> you see! madness!
[09:12:18] <timmywil> cosed
[09:12:18] <markelog> )
[09:12:19] <timmywil> closed
[09:12:37] <timmywil> ok, ms edge
[09:12:49] <m_gol> so
[09:12:59] <m_gol> I figured that it'd be good to test on it *before* the release
[09:13:13] <m_gol> instead of discovering blockers afterwards
[09:13:16] <m_gol> it looks good, though
[09:13:20] <timmywil> excellent idea
[09:13:23] <timmywil> thank you
[09:13:26] <m_gol> some feature tests now pass so they fixed a lot of things apparently :)
[09:13:33] <m_gol> there is this one focusin issue
[09:13:39] * markelog yeah, good thinking m_gol
[09:13:42] <m_gol> I contacted a couple of MS guys on Twitter
[09:13:56] <timmywil> we just got a response 3 min ago from jacob about focusin. He's waiting on a reponse about whether the removal was deliberate.
[09:13:57] <m_gol> focusin is still supported but there is no window.onfocusin
[09:14:18] <m_gol> fortunately we still have a 1.5 months to the release ;)
[09:14:20] <markelog> spec like support?
[09:14:26] <markelog> or chrome style?
[09:14:47] <m_gol> markelog: well, they forked from IE11 so I doubt they broke it in the process
[09:14:56] <m_gol> unless they thought breaking is important for back compat ;-)
[09:15:00] <m_gol> * for web compat
[09:15:14] <m_gol> but it'd be good to check
[09:15:16] <markelog> need to check that, if they removed window property, what else could they might did
[09:15:20] <markelog> )
[09:15:30] <m_gol> they changed the <a> URL parser to be more like Chrome
[09:15:33] <m_gol> e.g. port 80 is stripped
[09:16:11] <m_gol> and .pathname starts with "/"
[09:16:22] <m_gol> anyway, I'll be testing on Edge from time to time until it gets on BrowserStack
[09:16:30] <m_gol> when Safari 9 beta arrives I'll also try it
[09:16:58] <m_gol> last time with this qSA bug someone from Apple asked me why didn't we test on the 8 beta before the release to catch it earlier :P
[09:17:12] <m_gol> there is one Sizzle issue on Edge
[09:17:22] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/339
[09:17:29] <gibson042> right, the iframe thing AGAIN
[09:17:57] <timmywil> how did we fix the iframe thing before? I forget.
[09:18:18] <gibson042> the fix (setDocument() on unload) is probably still good
[09:18:20] <m_gol> if Edge broke sth, this is a good moment to contact someone from MS Edge team (I have emails if needed, DaveMethvin|away will be able to help with communication when he's back as well)
[09:18:22] <gibson042> it's detection that sucks
[09:18:50] <timmywil> ah, the unload handler
[09:19:07] <gibson042> m_gol: did they drop document.documentMode?
[09:19:07] <timmywil> which we're limiting to browsers with documentMode, iirc
[09:19:14] <m_gol> yup
[09:19:27] <gibson042> ugh
[09:19:27] <m_gol> gibson042: no documentMode, no X-UA-Compatible
[09:19:29] <timmywil> sigh
[09:19:33] <m_gol> Chrome-like userAgent
[09:19:42] <gibson042> everything-like userAgent :)
[09:19:43] <markelog> m_gol: could cc jquery-core in there?
[09:19:58] <timmywil> how duplicitous
[09:20:22] <m_gol> markelog: you mean in emails? I didn't send anything so far, I just got emails from Rey Bango so that I don't have to contact them on Twitter next time something happens :-)
[09:20:43] <markelog> yeah, cool
[09:20:44] <timmywil> It'd be great to get these things addressed on Edge's end, but it's good we know about this now.
[09:20:44] <m_gol> Edge userAgent is basically Chrome UA + " Edge/12.BUILD_NUMBER"
[09:21:20] <timmywil> If they don't address, we can commit some kind of fix.
[09:22:14] <m_gol> they're really good with communication now, though, so if they messed sth up they'll fix it :)
[09:22:34] <m_gol> timmywil: I PMd you contacts
[09:22:59] <gibson042> how prescient: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1772#issuecomment-72877984
[09:23:11] <m_gol> hahaha
[09:23:31] <timmywil> you the man
[09:23:43] <m_gol> yeah, so I think it'd be best to contact them for now, if they can't get the fix on time, we can patch then
[09:23:53] <timmywil> yup
[09:24:05] <timmywil> ok, setTimeout
[09:24:14] <m_gol> I sent 3 PRs :-)
[09:24:25] <timmywil> options!
[09:24:26] <m_gol> hopefully one of them is acceptable :P
[09:25:10] <timmywil> honestly, I like the biggest one :P
[09:25:11] <m_gol> the 2nd one won't work because of AMD, I didn't think about it when submitting
[09:25:13] <m_gol> hahaha
[09:25:31] <m_gol> it's certainly easier for contributors than the 3rd one
[09:25:48] <m_gol> in the 3rd one you need to know to use timeoutSet instead of setTimeout and that you have to inject it via AMD
[09:26:05] <timmywil> yea, I know it saves bytes, but I'm not a big fan of the maintenance cost
[09:26:10] <m_gol> but, +60 instead of +40
[09:26:35] <timmywil> it's true
[09:26:52] <timmywil> idk, what do others think?
[09:27:26] <m_gol> I have mixed feelings, that's why I sumbitted them all :)
[09:27:36] <m_gol> I think we should fix it as current behavior is confusing
[09:27:52] <timmywil> sure
[09:28:03] <gibson042> maintenance cost seems low to me, we don't use these functions in many places and attempting to will fail linting
[09:28:27] <timmywil> true, removing them from jshint helps keep us in check
[09:28:38] <gibson042> (in favor of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2394)
[09:28:50] <timmywil> but it is an extra brain cycle for new contributors
[09:28:56] <timmywil> ;)
[09:29:36] <gibson042> compat has 6 setTimeout calls and 1 setInterval
[09:29:59] <gibson042> master has (5, 1)
[09:30:24] <timmywil> and about 3 clearTimeouts, ya?
[09:30:36] <timmywil> it's not terrible
[09:30:47] <timmywil> I suppose 20 bytes is worth it
[09:30:52] <m_gol> 2 clearTimeouts on master
[09:31:14] <m_gol> and 1 clearInterval
[09:31:14] <timmywil> I see 3 in the PR
[09:31:24] <timmywil> but, w/e
[09:31:26] <gibson042> yeah
[09:31:31] <gibson042> it seems palatable
[09:31:57] <timmywil> markelog?
[09:32:00] <timmywil> you in favor?
[09:32:09] <markelog> hah?
[09:32:14] <timmywil> 2394
[09:32:21] <markelog> sorry was away for couple of minutes
[09:32:32] <timmywil> talking about setTimeout options
[09:32:35] <m_gol> markelog: we're choosing 1 of my 3 PRs ;)
[09:32:47] <markelog> let me take a closer look if you don't mind
[09:32:53] <markelog> i will post a comment in there
[09:32:55] <markelog> today
[09:32:57] <markelog> )
[09:33:03] <timmywil> ok, but it sounds like 2394 is the way to go
[09:33:53] <timmywil> Finally, I've got a PR in restoring legacy .offset() behavior for disconnected elements.
[09:34:02] <timmywil> I'd like to get that in today
[09:34:11] <timmywil> so UI can see green again
[09:34:16] <timmywil> mobile
[09:34:28] <markelog> so, what is final changes with offset()?
[09:34:37] <markelog> we throw a error at $(window).offset
[09:34:38] <timmywil> one question though. do we want to return zeros for hidden elements as well?
[09:34:45] <timmywil> markelog: that stays the same
[09:34:46] <markelog> but not for the $(<div/>).offset
[09:34:56] <timmywil> right, we'll return zeros for disconnected elements
[09:35:05] <markelog> is that all?
[09:35:14] <timmywil> we used to return zeros for hidden elements as well, but I separated that in the PR
[09:35:39] <gibson042> I don't want to separate them
[09:35:53] <timmywil> it *would* make the code simpler
[09:35:59] <timmywil> to treat both the same
[09:36:08] <timmywil> I was making no assumptions though
[09:36:26] <gibson042> offset is equally meaningless in both cases
[09:36:50] <timmywil> fair enough
[09:37:01] <timmywil> honestly, I was expecting push back from you gibson042 ;)
[09:37:07] <markelog> me too )
[09:37:25] <gibson042> don't get me wrong, I'm not in favor of returning zeroes again
[09:37:39] <gibson042> but that's just unhelpful purism
[09:37:58] <gibson042> apparently ;)
[09:38:01] <timmywil> ok, I'll update after the meeting
[09:38:22] <timmywil> Anyone have anything else for today?
[09:38:39] <timmywil> In that case, thanks everybody!
[09:38:40] <markelog> yeah
[09:38:42] <m_gol> when do we want to get an alpha out?
[09:38:45] <markelog> do we have a schedule?
[09:38:45] <timmywil> ha
[09:38:49] <markelog> )))
[09:38:56] <markelog> m_gol: high five!
[09:39:08] <m_gol> ;)
[09:40:08] <timmywil> it all depends on how much time the team has to dedicate to finishing up the major issues. I'm currently packing and getting ready to move so I'm off and on.
[09:40:35] <m_gol> we're waiting for issues marked "Blocker", right?
[09:40:39] <timmywil> right
[09:40:43] <m_gol> anything else can wait for further betas
[09:40:44] <m_gol> k
[09:40:57] <markelog> ok
[09:41:19] <m_gol> markelog: you might want to chime in re: focusin: https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/610484940925329412
[09:41:35] <timmywil> and we still need to drop some code for show/hide
[09:41:36] <markelog> thanks, will check it out
[09:41:54] <markelog> maan
[09:41:56] <markelog> that sucks
[09:42:03] <markelog> this is not good check
[09:42:06] <m_gol> ;)
[09:42:15] <m_gol> it's bad mainly because it steals focus, right?
[09:42:21] <markelog> yeah )
[09:42:26] <m_gol> is it async in IE as well?
[09:42:52] <m_gol> I mean, we could restore focus to what it was before but...
[09:42:54] <markelog> yes, as i recall
[09:43:11] <markelog> and what if input has on("focus") event?
[09:43:17] <m_gol> right
[09:43:26] <m_gol> that's a good check for a framework
[09:43:28] <m_gol> not a library
[09:43:34] <markelog> yeah
[09:43:37] <markelog> totally
[09:43:50] <timmywil> Let me throw out a date to shoot for. How about July 6? That's 3 weeks from now.
[09:44:00] <markelog> sounds good
[09:44:04] <m_gol> +1
[09:44:06] <markelog> why July 6 though?
[09:44:13] <markelog> is there like event or something?
[09:44:17] <timmywil> It's arbitrary.
[09:44:21] <markelog> ok-ok
[09:44:50] <timmywil> I can work up a blog post and finish my blockers by then.
[09:44:50] <markelog> I remember Dave used to put dates with conjunction with some event
[09:45:01] <timmywil> he did?
[09:45:01] <markelog> that is why i ask
[09:45:09] <markelog> yeah, like conference or something
[09:45:18] <markelog> we have one coming right?
[09:45:25] <m_gol> in September?
[09:45:40] <markelog> hm, not sure
[09:45:40] <timmywil> for an alpha, I think we can just release
[09:45:49] <markelog> sure
[09:45:50] <arthurvr> jQuery SF is June 22-23
[09:46:02] <timmywil> a week? hmmm
[09:46:14] <arthurvr> yeah
[09:46:18] <markelog>  too close i think
[09:46:23] <arthurvr> yep
[09:46:33] <timmywil> if we knuckled down, we could do it, but we've all got stuff going on
[09:47:47] <timmywil> We'll definitely want to align the final release with an event to announce it and show off the new stuff (or even the beta), but I'm less concerned about alphas.
[09:49:54] <timmywil> ok, thanks everyone. I'll talk to Dave about the date, but let's shoot for getting the blockers done in 3 weeks.
[09:50:36] <arthurvr> sounds good
[09:50:42] <arthurvr> bye everyone
