[12:01:05] <fnagel> hey
[12:01:13] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> So....pull requests seem to be piling up.
[12:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone want to try to work through that list with me for most of a day next week?
[12:05:32] <arschmitz> i can try to make time
[12:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. Does any day work better for you?
[12:05:50] <arschmitz> just let me know when
[12:06:06] <arschmitz> let me check my calendar
[12:06:37] <arschmitz> not friday or tuesday
[12:06:41] <arschmitz> any other day should be ok
[12:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, let's plan for a big UI day next Wednesday.
[12:09:09] <arschmitz> ok
[12:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I fixed the menu style regression.
[12:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> That has been merged to master.
[12:10:13] <arschmitz> the 3 issues you pinged me on
[12:10:16] <arschmitz> 2 have pr's
[12:10:23] <arschmitz> and one was fixed in button re-write
[12:10:29] <arschmitz> and just not closed
[12:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I figured you probably addressed that one.
[12:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> I forgot how I came across it.
[12:10:55] <arschmitz> that was while trac was all messed up too
[12:11:11] <arschmitz> so might not have been able to or might not have auto closed
[12:12:12] <arschmitz> both were pretty simple changes
[12:15:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: will we need another RC?
[12:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[12:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've got the button and selectmenu bugs in the agenda now.
[12:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> With links to the bugs and PRs.
[12:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> Errr... s/button/checkboxradio/
[12:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> The checkboxradio PR is good to merge.
[12:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> Haven't looked through the selectmenu one yet since it's more involved.
[12:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> There was a bug reported against themes from download builder: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/294
[12:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA, TR is busted.
[12:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> Weird, it worked fine when I reloaded the page.
[12:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> The sidebar was going crazy after I changed one of the colors.
[12:21:20] <arschmitz> crazy
[12:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll need to fix this bug, but it won't hold up the release since it's outside of jquery-ui.
[12:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, there was a selectmenu bug posted in the forums that I don't think ever made it to Trac.
[12:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find it.
[12:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-select-box-breaks-inside-absolutely-positioned-divs#14737000006731080
[12:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is actually just a z-index bug.
[12:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll reply to that thread.
[12:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> They can either add .ui-front to the positioned parent or use the appendTo option.
[12:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://jsfiddle.net/nap04mLa/4/
[12:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard anything about RTL in a while.
[12:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA
[12:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> So I just checked the PR.
[12:34:55] <scott_gonzalez> They've pushed a ton of commits.
[12:34:58] <scott_gonzalez> Haven't said anything.
[12:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll look through that later.
[12:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> Which brings us to the last item on the agenda...
[12:37:36] <scott_gonzalez> 1.12.0-rc.1 was released on Thursday.
[12:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks jzaefferer!
[12:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:45:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
