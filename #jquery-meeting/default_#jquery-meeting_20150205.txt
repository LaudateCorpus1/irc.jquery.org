[09:00:12] <jzaefferer> Can you share the agenda link?
[09:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmk0W43PzkG5RNbJu9oEZv5f-5KWeJo5z22kza6q2AM/edit#
[09:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> AFter today's meeting, we'll have meetings.jquery.org updated and everything will be findable then.
[09:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> We'll wait a few minutes to see if others join.
[09:02:42] <jperrault> sorry, here
[09:02:48] <jperrault> was looking at the PEP room
[09:03:27] <arschmitz> im here
[09:03:54] <snover> hello? hel—can you guys hear me? is my mic working?
[09:04:02] <snover> ok, great
[09:06:44] <jperrault> AFIK there is no skype for this...right?
[09:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Correct.
[09:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's get started. I think we've given people ample time to be late ;-)
[09:07:23] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[09:07:30] <jperrault> o/
[09:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> I believe everyone was already in the channel when I pasted the agenda link.
[09:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmk0W43PzkG5RNbJu9oEZv5f-5KWeJo5z22kza6q2AM/edit#
[09:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> First item is using ES6 modules for source files.
[09:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> We had discussed using AMD, but when I started working on it, I realized that we could do ES6 pretty easily.
[09:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> I know jzaefferer has looked over the PR since he had some comments, which I've already addressed.
[09:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> Has anyone else gotten a chance to look at it yet?
[09:09:12] <arschmitz> i did
[09:09:28] <jperrault> I read through it, I think it would be good to merge that before I make the next itern-related PR.
[09:09:44] <arschmitz> i built it and pulled it into my mobile branch that uses pointer events
[09:10:12] <arschmitz> Everything worked fine no issues either with the build or using the dist files
[09:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hearing no objections, I'll go ahead and merge that today.
[09:10:58] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[09:10:58] <jzaefferer> The failing iOS tests were fixed, right?
[09:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> I had to make a change to the source files though.
[09:11:40] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't figure out why the failure started after the ES6 chagne.
[09:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/PEP/commit/c741382824a94013156721bb7ee2313ed94e2e09
[09:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> And the related comment: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/157#issuecomment-72482336
[09:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to that change?
[09:12:43] <snover> scott_gonzalez: because es6 modules enforce use strict
[09:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, so this was bad before, it just didn't throw an error?
[09:13:23] <snover> yes
[09:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, so ES6 fixed a bug for us :-)
[09:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's paying off already.
[09:13:44] <snover> it’s not really a bug
[09:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> Bug in the sense that it was doing something it shouldn't be doing.
[09:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> Not that the behavior changed.
[09:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that will get merged after the meeting.
[09:15:08] <snover> well, mutating a dom event object is kind of something that shouldn’t be done…
[09:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> Next up is the switch to using Intern.
[09:15:45] <jperrault> The merge issues with PR #158 have been addressed.  I created a new fork based on PEP and added the intern changes back, and updated the label for PR #158 to indicate it should be deleted.
[09:16:02] <jperrault> I don't want to generate a new PR until I get some feedback on two issues (will get to those in a moment), as well as making some adjustments for the ES6 PR, once it lands.
[09:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: You should be able to close the PR.
[09:16:16] <jperrault> ok,, will do.
[09:16:29] <jperrault> The new branch is here: https://github.com/JacquesPerrault/PEP/tree/use-intern-for-testing2
[09:16:38] <jperrault> I addressed most of the comments scott_gonzalez made on PR #158, including formatting and src references.
[09:16:55] <jperrault> Open issues:
[09:17:04] <jperrault> 1: I still need to address the use of 'with', and would like snover's comments on that
[09:17:19] <jperrault> 2: All but two tests are passing, and I'm having some trouble resolving an issue between test/setup.js and test/dispatcher.js that I'd appreciate feedback on.  You can see the errors if you pull the branch above.
[09:17:49] <snover> jperrault: using with just provides a convenience for not having to write var test = tdd.test; var suite = tdd.suite; var before = tdd.before; var after = tdd.after;
[09:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer not to use with since it's a discouraged language feature.
[09:18:29] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez voiced some concerns in the PR #158 thread...
[09:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to hear opinions from others though.
[09:18:45] <snover> right. so, just write the aliases
[09:18:53] <snover> there are only four of them
[09:19:11] <jzaefferer> or use tdd.test etc. directly?
[09:19:14] <snover> or that
[09:19:26] <snover> long term view, hypothetically, you would be able to import * from 'intern!tdd'
[09:19:43] <snover> but of course this all relies on anyone agreeing to an actual loader standard
[09:19:50] <snover> which didn’t work when commonjs tried it
[09:20:20] <jzaefferer> are the tests going to use src files directly, or loading dist/pep.js?
[09:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with either (creating aliases for a potential future where we just import) or being explicit with tdd.whatever.
[09:20:31] <arschmitz> it seems simple enough to avoid with so probably should do it
[09:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> They're loading the dist file.
[09:20:37] <snover> they can only use the src files directly if they are AMD modules…
[09:21:09] <snover> i mean, you could write an AMD loader plugin to compile the es6 source, but…what a pain
[09:21:10] <jzaefferer> so <script src="../pointerevents.js"></script> is going to change to ../dist/PEP.js once the other PR lands?
[09:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> sort of
[09:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, yes, in the ES6 PR, that change exists.
[09:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> In the Intern PR, it switches to AMD loading.
[09:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> The test runner file goes away with Intern.
[09:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> See https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/157/files#r23782677
[09:22:36] <jperrault> the only place i reference src (for now) is in test/dispatcher.js
[09:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> and https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/158/files#diff-801764caf8b0b238274a5596efb19c85R3
[09:23:21] <jzaefferer> Well, let's merge the ES6 PR and update the Intern PR? Can review that then
[09:23:29] <jperrault> vg
[09:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:36] <jzaefferer> I made a note about with() on the minutes
[09:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:24:00] <scott_gonzalez> Next up is the release process.
[09:24:04] <jzaefferer> Can we use jquery-release?
[09:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:24:35] <jzaefferer> Makes it easy to commit built files for detached tags
[09:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> Let's give the team a few days to review that before making a final decision?
[09:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-release was created to automate the common parts of releases across jQuery Foundation projects.
[09:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release
[09:25:28] <jzaefferer> Let's create an issue for that and provide some context there
[09:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> It handles things like verifying AUTHORS.txt is up-to-date, generating changelogs, publshing to npm, the jQuery CDN, etc.
[09:26:00] <jzaefferer> I actually use that for a personal project as well, its decently flexible
[09:26:12] <arschmitz> +1 for jquery release its always worked well when iv used it and is pretty flexible
[09:27:26] <jrossi2> Oh that's pretty cool
[09:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get a release out as soon as our infrastructural changes are done (ES6, Intern, release process).
[09:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> Probably PEP 0.1.0.
[09:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> And then we can work on bug fixes, features, etc. once we know we're able to have everything building and tested automatically.
[09:28:33] <arschmitz> That would be good because then we could start work on jquery-pep and other related stuff
[09:28:39] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:28:54] <jperrault> Can we add a link to PEP minutes at http://meetings.jquery.org/  ?
[09:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> And we can get gh-pages set up again using the new build so the samples are hosted somewhere.
[09:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Yup, that will happen after the meeting once we have PEP minutes posted.
[09:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> So, that brings us to the last item on the agenda.
[09:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> We have a jquery-devs-team mailing list which includes the devs from all of the jQuery Foundation projects.
[09:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's fairly low traffic, mostly for things that are worth mentioning across projects.
[09:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> We generally use that to determine who has write access to the agendas as well.
[09:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll be sending invites to that list and by next meeting I'll update the agenda doc to not be editable to everyone, just to the mailing list.
[09:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> It will be world viewable like the other agendas.
[09:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:34:14] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:34:33] <jrossi2> Worth noting the formal objection that was revealed today. But not much to discuss really.
[09:34:35] <arschmitz> nope
[09:34:42] <jrossi2> (to the Recommendation spec)
[09:34:47] <arschmitz> :-/
[09:35:02] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi2: Sure. Do you want to discuss any details about it?
[09:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not even sure if we're allowed to discuss the reason for the objection.
[09:35:34] <jrossi2> The details of that objection are still member confidential. But I'll say that I think the odds are still in favor of publishing a REC at the moment.
[09:35:44] <jzaefferer> Do you have a link to the discussion (or whatever there is)?
[09:35:52] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2015JanMar/0005.html
[09:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> The actual details are in a members only list.
[09:36:32] <jrossi2> If you are a member and have a W3C account, you can read it here: https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/PointerEvents-PR/results
[09:37:03] <arschmitz> https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2015JanMar/0010.html has a lot more details for those of us without access
[09:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's it for today.
[09:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you next week.
[09:38:57] <jrossi2> Thanks!
[09:40:49] <arthurvr> bye!
[11:01:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: arthurvr: cgack: gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot sfrisk: Meeting Time
[11:02:03] <sfrisk> allo
[11:02:08] <arthurvr> hey-hey
[11:02:16] <sfrisk> I can be here for the first 30 minutes, work meeting after that
[11:02:39] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:03:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:04:15] <jasperdegroot> does anyone have the link to the agenda?
[11:04:25] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=141054388
[11:04:29] <jasperdegroot> it doesn't appear in my Google Drive anymore :/
[11:04:31] <jasperdegroot> thanks!
[11:05:06] <arschmitz> ok since sfrisk has limited time and there is something involving her lets start with that
[11:05:32] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: pinging sfrisk and i on the high contrast issue got us thinking
[11:05:59] <arschmitz> that there are likely many mobile issues that should really be moved to chassis for consideration there.
[11:06:09] <arschmitz> Because they will either be addressed there or likely not at all
[11:06:20] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:06:47] <arschmitz> So if anyone comes across an issue that could potentially pertain to chassis please ping sfrisk and i on it.
[11:07:06] <gabriel_schulhof> /o
[11:07:23] <jasperdegroot> I think we should only fix bugs in Mobile and leave big changes / new features for Chassis
[11:07:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: exactly
[11:08:02] <arschmitz> so anything that MAY fall into that please ping both of us on the issue so we can decide where it should go
[11:08:17] <jasperdegroot> maybe this is good example https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6405
[11:08:29] <jasperdegroot> although we did deprecate we might leave it for now
[11:08:51] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sure that is a good example of something we should consider for this
[11:08:56] <jasperdegroot> so people dont have to upgrade and then do it again when we switch to Chassis
[11:09:15] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: and some cases that may be a better choice
[11:09:28] <arschmitz> others it may make sense to update now to how chassis will do it
[11:09:33] <jasperdegroot> yeah, good to think all things over
[11:09:35] <arschmitz> so that we can make the transisition smoother
[11:09:43] <jasperdegroot> yes agreed
[11:10:11] <jasperdegroot> will transitions be part of Chassis or do we keep that in Mobile?
[11:10:19] <arschmitz> So in the spirit of playing nice with chassis and making the transition as smooth as possible i would like sfrisk pinged on all those issues
[11:10:23] <arschmitz> mobile
[11:10:30] <arschmitz> those will be moving to JS as well
[11:10:43] <jasperdegroot> there are still some transitions issue and we were planning on full review/rewrite
[11:11:06] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: if you recall we decided the rewrite will use js though not css
[11:11:07] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:11:19] <jasperdegroot> yeah, we talked about that
[11:11:32] <arschmitz> related there is some news this week
[11:11:47] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2053
[11:12:17] <sfrisk> Yay for pinging!
[11:12:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Whew! That's nice!
[11:13:29] <arschmitz> also related to core there was talk of dropping support for android 2.3 in 3.0
[11:13:42] <arschmitz> and only supporting in the compat version
[11:13:52] <arschmitz> this would have been hard for us
[11:14:00] <arschmitz> since compat does not support hybrid apps
[11:14:26] <arschmitz> so we could not have officially supported android 2.3 cordova builds with 3.x at all
[11:14:53] <arschmitz> This is not going to happen though 2.3 will remain in 3.x
[11:15:33] <arschmitz> ok 1.5 stuff
[11:16:21] <arschmitz> in ui classes is very close to landing on master
[11:16:28] <arschmitz> along with it there is now
[11:16:44] <arschmitz> https://www.npmjs.com/package/qunit-assert-classes
[11:17:41] <arthurvr> arschmitz: assert-classes is nice work bro :)
[11:17:50] <arschmitz> arthurvr: thanks
[11:18:21] <arschmitz> i updated every is/hasClass/attr( "Class" test in UI to use this
[11:18:27] <arschmitz> id like to see the same in mobile
[11:18:47] <arschmitz> but hoping someone else might want to do it i dont think i can change another 500 tests and keep my sanity right now
[11:20:01] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:20:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, we have the classes PRs so it breaks the task down nicely.
[11:20:33] <arschmitz> for the widgets at least yes
[11:21:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: is the tests branch ready now?
[11:23:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes.
[11:23:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Sorry.
[11:23:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Reading the animation issue
[11:23:30] <gabriel_schulhof> I've started building on top of it.
[11:23:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Started with textinput ...
[11:23:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok then i will merge that into ui-1-12 as well as make ui-1-12 include the qunit plugin
[11:24:01] <arschmitz> to base classes pr's off
[11:24:12] <gabriel_schulhof> :+1:
[11:24:30] <arschmitz> also related to ui-1-12
[11:25:07] <arschmitz> the issue gabriel_schulhof brought up with how we were finding inputs is now addressed
[11:25:22] <arschmitz> and its now more efecient too
[11:25:30] <jasperdegroot> nice
[11:25:36] <arschmitz> Button has also changed how icons work a bit
[11:25:52] <arschmitz> icons will now be placed inline rather then positioned
[11:26:12] <arschmitz> and there will just be a ui-icon-display-block class for setting them to display block and centering them
[11:26:22] <arschmitz> for top/bottom
[11:27:48] <arschmitz> this will allow any number of icons instead of just one
[11:28:44] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: did you already pulled this change in ui-1-12 or not yet
[11:28:44] <arschmitz> ok next
[11:28:48] <arschmitz> no
[11:28:51] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:29:06] <arschmitz> will as soon as im done with the other updates they are apart of
[11:29:14] <jasperdegroot> I still have to do some work on the button, controlgroup, and checkboxradio demos
[11:29:31] <jasperdegroot> but better wait until everything is in the branch
[11:29:40] <jasperdegroot> and ui-1-12-tests has been merged
[11:29:46] <arschmitz> this will change the prerendeded and enhanced examples a lot
[11:29:53] <jasperdegroot> yes
[11:29:57] <arschmitz> widget ones it wont change at all
[11:30:21] <jasperdegroot> but the enhanced demos are the ones that need most attention
[11:30:22] <arschmitz> it also reduced the ui button css to only 42lines
[11:30:34] <arschmitz> so thats pretty awesome
[11:31:22] <arschmitz> ok has anyone ever looked at bithound?
[11:31:47] <arschmitz> gseguin|away|awa: submitted a pr for supporting it
[11:32:10] <jasperdegroot> ah, that's where i saw it
[11:32:22] <arschmitz> I personally have mixed feelings because while its neat i dont see my self actually using it
[11:32:57] <arschmitz> so unless other feel they will actually actively use it i don't think we should add the file. If we don't use it its just bloat in the repo.
[11:33:32] <arschmitz> does anyone else have any thoughts about this?
[11:34:26] <gabriel_schulhof> *shrug* ... I mean, it doesn't affect the product that we ship, so I don't mind so much. I'm saying this having never heard of it, of course. My only worry is that we'll end up reluctantly having to support something we don't really use.
[11:34:52] <jasperdegroot> I think this is more something we need a general policy for, not only Mobile
[11:35:10] <jasperdegroot> otherwise all projects use different things in their ignore files
[11:35:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, good point.
[11:35:43] <jasperdegroot> specially now we are merging UI and Mobile
[11:35:52] <arschmitz> This is really up to us
[11:35:59] <arschmitz> we use coveralls and others dont
[11:36:04] <arschmitz> though some are considdering
[11:36:12] <jasperdegroot> but that's about using a tool
[11:36:14] <arschmitz> its about if we as a team will actually use this tool
[11:36:30] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[11:36:41] <arschmitz> we can use any tools we like
[11:36:44] <jasperdegroot> I thought it was only for convenience for user that use that tool
[11:36:50] <arschmitz> but i dont want to add tools just for the sake of adding tools
[11:36:51] <jasperdegroot> users*
[11:37:02] <arschmitz> no this would be for us
[11:37:12] <jasperdegroot> ok, misunderstood
[11:37:24] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so this is yet another analysis service?
[11:37:30] <arschmitz> yes
[11:38:32] <gabriel_schulhof> We must've hammered their Web server :) I can't access the "About" link ... oh, hey! They're canucks!
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> lol
[11:39:24] <gabriel_schulhof> OK ... doesn't actually say what bithound does.
[11:39:28] <arschmitz> this pr would make the service give more accurate data
[11:39:48] <arschmitz> they measure code quality / stability/ maintainability
[11:39:58] <arschmitz> and also list out of date dependencies
[11:41:30] <arschmitz> interesting to note of the priority files they list for us only 3 are actually in our code base
[11:41:34] <arschmitz> the rest are external
[11:42:15] <jasperdegroot> do you think we will do anything different once we use that tool?
[11:42:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, if we get this for free, this should only come up when we change the directory structure ...
[11:42:39] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: well that was my question
[11:42:44] <arschmitz> will any one actually use this
[11:42:51] <arschmitz> i will likely never use it my self
[11:42:58] <arschmitz> if others will im ok with adding the file
[11:43:08] <arschmitz> if no one will use it the file is just bloat
[11:43:32] <jasperdegroot> I think we won't use it much
[11:43:45] <jasperdegroot> so no need to add
[11:43:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what do you think?
[11:44:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Doesn't look like we need it much.
[11:44:14] <arschmitz> ok ill close then
[11:44:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do these bithound guys run these things for free, automatically, whether we want them to or not?
[11:45:23] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because if they do, we could reduce our CO2 footprint by merging that PR.
[11:45:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i think they just do it
[11:45:41] <arschmitz> they have it for qunit ui
[11:45:43] <arschmitz> others

[11:50:31] <arschmitz> yes
[11:51:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the last 2 itesm are yours from last week
[11:52:00] <arschmitz> anything new?
[11:53:04] <arschmitz> oh and one last thing relating to pointer events
[11:53:05] <arschmitz> well 2
[11:53:16] <arschmitz> there is now a working build of pep using es6 modules
[11:53:29] <arschmitz> i pulled it into a mobile branch and tested and all worked well
[11:54:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Nothing new on those two. I've been working on a few bugs and on the classes for textinput, listview, and popup.
[11:54:41] <arschmitz> and on less happy pointer event news there is this https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2015JanMar/thread.html
[11:55:32] <arschmitz> Yandex made a formal objection to the w3c pointer events recommendation wanting it dropped
[11:57:45] <arschmitz> I cant tell you any more then what in the thread
[11:58:07] <arschmitz> but since this could have a pretty big potential impact on us i wanted to make everyone aware
[11:59:45] <arschmitz> Thats all i have today and thats about time
[12:00:03] <arschmitz> if no one else has anything ill see everyone back on dev
