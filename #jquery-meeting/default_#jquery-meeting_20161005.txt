[12:03:20] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:20] <fnagel> hi
[12:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to investigate the datepicker bug in iOS 10: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15050
[12:05:19] <arschmitz> i keep forgetting about that one
[12:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone want to take ownership of that?
[12:05:46] <arschmitz> i dont have any other ui stuff at moment so i can
[12:06:00] <fnagel> Sorry, no mac available
[12:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks arschmitz
[12:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel also has a PR for the new datepicker which adds more test coverage: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1755
[12:07:54] <fnagel> working on the comments asap
[12:08:08] <fnagel> we might want to talk about that timezone test issue
[12:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should set that up in Travis.
[12:09:34] <fnagel> probably something for another PR, right?
[12:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> We had a few issue with checkboxradio styling.

[12:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15055
[12:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz addressed them in two PRs:
[12:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1753
[12:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1756
[12:12:49] <scott_gonzalez> Those have both been merged.
[12:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> We had a bug filed about draggable on native dialogs.
[12:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15063
[12:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that native dialogs are positioned with:
[12:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> position: absolute; left: 0; right: 0; margin: auto;
[12:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's not CSS that we support for draggable.
[12:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> Since dialog isn't common, and is basically Chrome only, I'm inclined to close this as won't fix.
[12:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> I made an example of how a user can work around this on their own: http://jsbin.com/wizediduqu/edit?html,js,output
[12:17:00] <arschmitz> yeah i would close and say if more browsers implement we will re considder
[12:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I can't find the comment you just wrote about using `assert`, but yes, we want to use it everywhere.
[12:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> I hate that the new GitHub emails don't contain the hash for the actual comment.
[12:19:25] <fnagel> yeah, second thought was: just do it, so I removed the comment. sorry for the confusion
[12:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> Hearing no objections, I'll close that draggable ticket.
[12:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:22:53] <arschmitz> i dont
[12:23:45] <fnagel> no
[12:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
