[08:59:30] <fnagel> hey
[08:59:34] <rxaviers> hello
[08:59:35] <kborchers> yo
[08:59:48] <tj_vantoll> heyo
[09:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll and I have been working through the docs updates.
[09:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> We've got the ability to provide custom examples for methods now.
[09:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> And tj_vantoll is working through the extension points one by one.
[09:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> I started documenting jQuery.Widget methods as well.
[09:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> After that is updating the docs for return types: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/164
[09:01:53] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #164 by tjvantoll (3w 3d ago): Missing `jQuery` return type for several methods

[09:03:30] <tj_vantoll> I'm about half way done with the extension points, plan on finishing those by the end of the week and going from there.
[09:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on automating the CLA checks.
[09:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> I have a grunt task which does the check, but we can't make it live until all existing commits are covered.
[09:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> So I've been trying to get all past contributors to sign.
[09:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> We're down to 381 commits by 84 authors.
[09:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> So still quite a few people to chase, but we're getting there.
[09:08:06] <tj_vantoll> I'm assuming that same process would need to be done for each project?
[09:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:09:14] <tj_vantoll> Fun times :)
[09:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, it's a blast ;-P
[09:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to report?
[09:10:36] <tj_vantoll> In Austin, did you guys decide that we're going to cut off 1.11 when selectmenu is merged in?
[09:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get AMD into 1.11 as well.
[09:11:20] <fnagel1> @kborchers Any news on https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/pull/315
[09:11:21] <b-ot> fnagel1: Pull request #315 by kborchers (1w 14h ago): Test PR
[09:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll see.
[09:11:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i removed a commit (grouping) and pushed a new one (items option) on that Menu PR if you get a chance to take a look … i'm thinking this PR may also help the text click issue in Selectmenu
[09:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks kborchers.
[09:12:08] <kborchers> fnagel1: i was waiting for this other PR to be merged first but i could probably just add it to this one as well
[09:12:24] <tj_vantoll> ok
[09:13:13] <fnagel1> kborchers: ok, never mind, just wanted to make sure its not forgotten
[09:13:21] <kborchers> nope ;)
[09:13:26] <fnagel1> :-)
[09:15:16] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: What about your Selectmenu review? Can we merge it (regardless of the two open issues)? There are some issue reports I would like to fix...
[09:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's ready to merge yet.
[09:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> There's no reason to wait on fixing issues.
[09:17:11] <fnagel1> Mhh why not?
[09:17:22] <fnagel1> I will go fix these regardless of your PR
[09:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, did you mean can you merge my changes into the selectmenu branch?
[09:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, you can merge that. I thought you were asking if we were ready to merge into master.
[09:18:24] <fnagel1> Sorry, not merge to master but your PR to selectmenu branch
[09:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I just did it separately so you could look through the changes before bringing them into the branch.
[09:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> You can pull all or part of it whenever you want.
[09:19:41] <fnagel1> Will you take a look into the two comments? https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/commit/f416a66f59e628bc635e120a39927be0fef139d1#commitcomment-4106188
[09:19:42] <b-ot> fnagel1: Scott González (1w 1d ago): Selectmenu: Code review.
[09:20:03] <fnagel1> I will pull all as it seems fine (expect that "follow anchor" issue)
[09:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> commented
[09:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:25:26] <fnagel1> scott_gonzales: please see again (your PR)
[09:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> Fix what?
[09:32:06] <jzaefferer> I've started with the polymer pointerevents polyfill. I can now appreciate why Kris got stuck with that. I still have a few local changes that I need to clean up and push.
[09:32:51] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: the anchor issue
[09:33:09] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:33:35] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i'd like to see what you've done so far (no matter how much/little). i'm hoping someone else diving in will spark my brain to think from different angles and dig back in
[09:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's continue any other discussion in -dev.
[09:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:39:37] <rxaviers> I've been in hiatus for the past weeks. But, I have resumed CLDR work now and I may have updates this week.
[09:39:57] <rxaviers> In brief, I've been working on the CLDR JSON vs. LDML basics to support Globalize needs http://git.io/h4lmVg before. Basically, abstracting the data access by handling hierarchy complexitites and by easying the process to figure out some implicit info like (language, region, script) given a locale (eg. en, pt_BR, jp).
[09:40:07] <rxaviers> After reading the news of version 24, I have found the JSON spec http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/json. Interestingly, I haven't found this before. It's weird. From what spec says, I should not worry with resolving hierarchy complexities on our CLDR implementation. (spec says "The JSON representation is based on the fully resolved form"). Although, the available JSON data is not fully resolved. So, I am spending some time now trying to ru
[09:40:07] <rxaviers> n the java conversion tool they offer (which doesn't work by simply following readme unfortunately) to see the output of this tool. If still in doubt, I will ask people in the mailing list. So, we can decide whether to rely on that or continue to implement some base logics in our side.
[09:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. Did you need to make any updates based on the changes in v24?
[09:42:29] <rxaviers> That spec precedes v24 actually
[09:43:01] <rxaviers> I just found more info that I need to dig in before moving on I think
[09:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> See everyone back in -dev.
