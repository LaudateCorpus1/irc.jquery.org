[12:01:28] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:43] <bethge> Hi
[12:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> hi
[12:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> I have to admit, I got wrapped up in "real work" and did not prepare at all. I just remembered the meeting four minutes ago :-/
[12:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: I see that you were doing more work on nested pointerenter/leave events.
[12:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/274
[12:04:40] <bethge> Yeah, indeed, sorry going back and forth between "wip" and "ready"
[12:05:57] <bethge> I hope I understand correctly, that whenever a finger touches an element, all its ancestors get a `pointerenter`
[12:07:36] <bethge> I noticed more and more things to consider. I feel like having functional tests for these kinds of issues would be great, since they are not covered by w3c tests, afaik.
[12:09:03] <arschmitz> bethge seems like a good idea
[12:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> If the W3C tests don't cover this, we can expand them.
[12:12:53] <bethge> Should we write our own tests and run them in parallel or expand the w3c tests and ask the PE wg if they want to add them?
[12:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer expanding the W3C tests.
[12:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> If it tests spec conformance, it makes sense to have it in the W3C test suite.
[12:14:06] <arschmitz> im sure the WG will be more then happy to add tests
[12:15:43] <bethge> Ok cool, I will cook something up for PR-274
[12:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> great
[12:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What's the status of https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/245?
[12:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> I still get errors when I run `grunt test` with that.
[12:17:29] <arschmitz> weird i thought it was good
[12:17:37] <arschmitz> no one ever commented that they got errors
[12:19:03] <arschmitz> i see yours about node 5.3.0 but that does not look at all related to the selenium server thats an intern error
[12:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/245#issuecomment-181905262
[12:19:49] <arschmitz> wasnt it 5.3.0 that broke grunt basicly
[12:19:58] <arschmitz> and fixed with 5.3.1
[12:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah?
[12:20:21] <arschmitz> one of the 5.x did
[12:20:27] <arschmitz> cant remember which
[12:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> Testing on 0.12 right now.
[12:20:56] <arschmitz> they broke path.relative in one of the 5.x releases
[12:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well that worked.
[12:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> Install 5.9.1 now.
[12:21:38] <arschmitz> 5.x also has the change to node_modules
[12:21:44] <arschmitz> which might break something in the chain
[12:22:01] <scott_gonzalez> WHY DO YOU HATE INNOVATION?!?!?!?!?!?
[12:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[12:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like selenium didn't stop even on 0.12.
[12:22:53] <arschmitz> hmm
[12:23:04] <arschmitz> i have a manual "oh shit" hook i use on a different project
[12:23:20] <arschmitz> to stop it if its running no matter what when grunt errors or exits
[12:23:23] <arschmitz> i can add that
[12:23:39] <arschmitz> i use a different package here and didnt think i was going to need it
[12:23:51] <arschmitz> i didnt get the issues with not stopping
[12:24:04] <arschmitz> bethge pretty sure you had tested this too right?
[12:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> Seems to be working properly with 5.9.1 though.
[12:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> Successfully ran it three times in a row on 5.9.1 just now.
[12:25:36] <arschmitz> hmm
[12:25:43] <arschmitz> i honestly never tried with 12
[12:25:45] <bethge> just ran it on 5.7 with an error: Failed to load module intern/node_modules/dojo/node from ...
[12:25:46] <arschmitz> i tried with 10 and 4
[12:25:52] <arschmitz> 5.7.0?
[12:26:00] <arschmitz> that the broken version i just found it lol
[12:26:06] <arschmitz> https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5383
[12:26:29] <bethge> yeah, downloading 5.9.1 now
[12:26:52] <arschmitz> yeah nothing is likely to work on 5.7.0
[12:28:36] <bethge> it works!
[12:29:00] <bethge> With 5.9.1 and deleting the node_modules folder
[12:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you want to check if we still need the modified shrinkwrap before we land this?
[12:32:57] <arschmitz> yeah ill double check
[12:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully they fixed that while we were waiting :-
[12:33:13] <arschmitz> can hope
[12:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:54:24] <arschmitz> oh i did
[12:54:28] <arschmitz> but got distracted lol
[12:55:43] <arschmitz> i was looking at any potential breakage from ios 9.3
[12:56:02] <arschmitz> and realized we make an assumption that has not been correct for a long time
[12:56:19] <arschmitz> we assume that pointer event support === touch-action support
[12:58:26] <arschmitz> which did i guess save us from breaking on iOS 9.3
[12:58:31] <arschmitz> but is still not correct
[13:07:13] <bethge> arschmitz: you mean pointer-event-support imples touch-action-support or touch-action-support implies pointer-event-support or both ways?
[13:07:36] <arschmitz> pointer event support implies touch-action support
[13:07:40] <arschmitz> is what we have now
[13:07:54] <arschmitz> but chrome has just touch-action for a long time
[13:08:04] <arschmitz> and now ios 9.3 has partial support
[13:08:37] <arschmitz> bethge we set touch action props
[13:08:42] <bethge> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/blob/master/src/touch-action.js#L26
[13:08:54] <arschmitz> bethge exactly
[13:09:09] <bethge> uuh, yeah, that is dangerous
[13:09:39] <arschmitz> and just plain wrong
[13:10:51] <arschmitz> looks like we never added the manipulation value either
[13:13:19] <bethge> Hmm ... where do we use touch-action as a css property?
[13:15:04] <bethge> I thought it is mostly for handling touch input, but for touch we also read the attribute of the html node, iiuc: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/blob/master/src/touch.js#L48
[13:18:15] <arschmitz> bethge we copy the attribute
[13:18:22] <arschmitz> to be a css rule
[13:18:29] <arschmitz> for browsers that support it native
[13:18:35] <arschmitz> is the theory there
[13:20:48] <bethge> stupid question: why do we do that?
[13:20:48] <arschmitz> so you dont have to write it twice in 2 different places
[13:20:48] <arschmitz> other wise you would need to do the attibute and the style
[13:20:49] <arschmitz> to cover all browsers
[13:21:05] <bethge> ah ok
[13:21:16] <arschmitz> but we should use native where we can instead of faking it
[13:21:17] <arschmitz> like in chrome
[13:22:27] <arschmitz> kinda comes around to what we talked about with just using the style attribute too i guess
[13:23:20] <arschmitz> and at this point i have no idea if apple has any intention of supporting values besides manipulation
[14:00:43] <cogwurx> hello!
[14:01:26] <gabrielschulhof> Hey! It's not moderated ... well, I guess it was left open from the last meeting.
[14:01:58] <cgack> freedom!
[14:02:02] <cgack> howdy
[14:02:11] <cogwurx> anarchy!
[14:02:29] <apsdehal> Hey
[14:05:21] <arschmitz> hey sorry
[14:05:33] <arschmitz> yeah we never officially ended last meeting lol
[14:05:45] <arschmitz> sfrisk jasperdegroot  agcolom
[14:05:46] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[14:06:59] <arschmitz> so lots and lots of activity
[14:07:01] <arschmitz> this week
[14:07:11] <arschmitz> we are down from 34 open pr's to 4
[14:07:20] <cogwurx> YAY!
[14:07:25] <cogwurx> great work everyone!
[14:07:43] <gabrielschulhof> Wow!
[14:08:06] <cgack> sweet
[14:08:27] <arschmitz> so tables are landed
[14:08:36] <arschmitz> all test are green including demos
[14:09:24] <jasperdegroot> nice
[14:09:32] <jasperdegroot> any idea what was going wrong?
[14:09:41] <jasperdegroot> with the demos spider I mean
[14:10:36] <sfrisk_> (hey, I'm in a meeting so limited availability)
[14:12:13] <arschmitz> yes
[14:12:23] <arschmitz> so it was the url re-writing on the root page
[14:12:37] <arschmitz> we re-write all the panel and slide bar links
[14:12:43] <arschmitz> and it was not working
[14:12:54] <arschmitz> on the search panel
[14:13:47] <jasperdegroot> ah I see
[14:14:01] <arschmitz> on the other tests
[14:14:03] <jasperdegroot> so the links were only broken when using search
[14:14:08] <arschmitz> yes
[14:14:10] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:14:13] <arschmitz> and only from root page
[14:14:19] <arschmitz> if you were on a demo page it worked fine
[14:14:36] <arschmitz> there were about a dozen other issues too
[14:14:37] <jasperdegroot> good thing we have that spider
[14:14:41] <arschmitz> broken links and what not
[14:14:48] <jasperdegroot> yeah I can imagine
[14:14:56] <arschmitz> so thats all fixed
[14:15:16] <arschmitz> tests we had a breakage in transitions
[14:15:30] <arschmitz> on core because they change the whole api for then / when in deffereds
[14:15:34] <arschmitz> thats fixed too
[14:15:48] <arschmitz> we got the whole test bootstrap landed
[14:16:02] <arschmitz> with a little docs page to explain how it works
[14:16:14] <arschmitz> the demos updates are all landed
[14:16:24] <arschmitz> know we need more but goot to get what he had landed
[14:16:45] <arschmitz> all the updates for page visibility and the pagecontainer classes are landed
[14:16:54] <jasperdegroot> nice work!
[14:16:54] <arschmitz> all apsdehal  test updates are landed
[14:17:30] <arschmitz> so the only thing blocking master is still selectmenu
[14:17:40] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof any updates there?
[14:17:47] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[14:17:58] <gabrielschulhof> I found another pagehide handler hiding in selectmenu.
[14:18:08] <gabrielschulhof> I removed it and I've just found the tests passing.
[14:18:15] <arschmitz> great
[14:18:22] <gabrielschulhof> My next step is to rebase onto 1.5-dev.
[14:18:28] <arschmitz> so one more thing now is to update to use the bootstrap and rebase with 1.5-dev
[14:18:34] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[14:18:45] <gabrielschulhof> Looking forward to the conflicts :)
[14:18:55] <arschmitz> we didnt rebase 1.5
[14:19:00] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, no?
[14:19:02] <arschmitz> no
[14:19:09] <gabrielschulhof> So, wait, onto what should I rebase?
[14:19:15] <arschmitz> going to wait at this point till we go to master
[14:19:17] <arschmitz> 1.5-dev
[14:19:42] <arschmitz> we landed stuff there but didnt rebase so it should not conflict everything
[14:19:46] <arschmitz> just legit things
[14:20:00] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, I was planning on rebasing onto 1.5-dev
[14:20:19] <gabrielschulhof> Didn't even think about master.
[14:20:20] <arschmitz> i dont think apsdehal updates the slectmenu tests anywhere either
[14:20:25] <arschmitz> so you shoudl be good
[14:20:34] <arschmitz> we will go to master
[14:20:40] <arschmitz> with 1.5-dev once selectmenu lands
[14:20:43] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:21:01] <arschmitz> we still have a lot of broken demos until that lands
[14:21:13] <apsdehal> Yes, I haven't touched selectmenu
[14:21:35] <apsdehal> Except the index.html file I think
[14:21:38] <gabrielschulhof> OK, then I'll look at the other tests as a template, and I'll apply bootstrap to selectmenu.
[14:21:45] <arschmitz> i have not seen any timeouts or flaky tests since this update either
[14:21:54] <gabrielschulhof> Good stuff!
[14:22:03] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/1.5-dev/tests
[14:22:13] <arschmitz> we added a readme to tests
[14:22:26] <gabrielschulhof> Very nice!
[14:22:44] <arschmitz> oh we also now have assert.domEqual
[14:22:50] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: Ping me, if you have any questions related to bootstrap
[14:22:53] <arschmitz> to replace testhelper version
[14:22:56] <arschmitz> and it gives a diff
[14:23:21] <arschmitz> but im actually working on seperating that and maybe changing the api
[14:23:25] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Is that somewhere in external/?
[14:23:27] <arschmitz> so i wouldnt jump on it just yet
[14:23:36] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof no but thats where it will be
[14:23:45] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:23:46] <arschmitz> its just a copyed file in the test/lib
[14:23:48] <arschmitz> from ui
[14:24:01] <arschmitz> but im making it a stand alone asserting extention
[14:24:07] <arschmitz> so we can bot hjust depend on it
[14:24:35] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof ill actually be looking for some feedback similar to qunit-assert-classes
[14:24:43] <arschmitz> it will be a suite of dom assertions
[14:25:10] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Between testHelper and UI's version, I think it covers most of the common use cases.
[14:25:13] <arschmitz> so would like to figure out what scenerios we would like to cover
[14:25:23] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof i want to remove the testhelper
[14:25:44] <arschmitz> and add things for checking different types of dom equality
[14:25:46] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I know, but as you create the extension, you can look at what testhelper does and what UI's version does and do the union.
[14:26:01] <apsdehal> Mostly testHelper is used atm for navigations
[14:26:04] <arschmitz> yeah i was also thinking things like sameNode
[14:26:14] <arschmitz> differentNode
[14:26:35] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: What are the semantics of that?
[14:26:54] <gabrielschulhof> Anyway, we can talk about this on -dev.
[14:26:58] <arschmitz> well in general we do $( "thing" )[ 0 ] === $( otherthing )[ 0 ]
[14:27:01] <gabrielschulhof> But it's a good idea.
[14:27:01] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:27:40] <arschmitz> anyway so if anyone has ideas for useful dom assertions
[14:27:43] <arschmitz> let me know
[14:28:40] <arschmitz> so next thing
[14:28:44] <arschmitz> cogwurx
[14:28:46] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot
[14:28:50] <arschmitz> demos are looking great
[14:28:54] <arschmitz> once we are happy there
[14:29:00] <arschmitz> i would love a good website refresh
[14:29:06] <arschmitz> to call attention to new version
[14:29:21] <jasperdegroot> website refresh?
[14:29:26] <arschmitz> jquerymobile.com
[14:29:33] <arschmitz> fix it up
[14:29:39] <arschmitz> make it all shiny and new
[14:30:02] <jasperdegroot> you mean within the possibilities of the WordPress theme that we are using?
[14:30:05] <arschmitz> yes
[14:30:19] <cgack> would that change the other sites that use that theme as well?
[14:30:30] <arschmitz> no
[14:30:36] <jasperdegroot> we wouldn't change the theme
[14:30:39] <jasperdegroot> just the content
[14:30:50] <arschmitz> we also have theme override stuff
[14:30:50] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/tree/master/themes/jquerymobile.com
[14:31:03] <cgack> okay cool
[14:31:04] <arschmitz> it has its own theme seperate that inherits from others
[14:31:17] <jasperdegroot> yeah I did that for this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/pull/120
[14:31:19] <arschmitz> so we have a lot of flexibility within that
[14:31:52] <arschmitz> so i would really like to see that get spruced p
[14:32:00] <arschmitz> it will bring more attention to new release
[14:32:18] <jasperdegroot> about that PR ... maybe the team members that already submitted a text want to review it since the  PR is more than a year old
[14:32:21] <arschmitz> cogwurx jasperdegroot  does that sound like something the 2 of you would be interest in
[14:32:30] <arschmitz> yes lets get new members added
[14:32:32] <arschmitz> and land that
[14:32:49] <cogwurx> ?? redesign/updated theme for jquerymobile.com?
[14:32:49] <arschmitz> apsdehal sfrisk for sure
[14:32:53] <arschmitz> cogwurx yes
[14:33:03] <jasperdegroot> not really redesign
[14:33:20] <cogwurx> "refresh"
[14:33:37] <jasperdegroot> I think we are not supposed to make big changes, only like small customizations
[14:33:38] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:33:39] <arschmitz> as far as im concerned go as crazy as you want within the confines of what we can do without effecting other sites
[14:33:54] <arschmitz> and breaking layouts for common stuff
[14:33:58] <arschmitz> like the header and footer
[14:33:59] <cogwurx> I'm game...
[14:34:10] <cogwurx> but breaking things is half the fun!
[14:34:30] <jasperdegroot> I think we should focus on the content first
[14:34:33] <arschmitz> like we of course need to keep the ad banners and what not
[14:34:43] <jasperdegroot> if some content needs changes in layout/style then go for it
[14:34:46] <gabrielschulhof> cogwurx: I totally read that as "but breaking things in half is fun"
[14:34:54] <cogwurx> lol
[14:35:00] <arschmitz> i think both apply
[14:35:07] <arschmitz> breaking things in half can be lots of fun
[14:35:15] <jasperdegroot> there is still enough to do to get demos in really good shape
[14:35:19] <arschmitz> espically if you get ot use like a big sword
[14:35:26] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot yes demos first
[14:35:35] <cogwurx> I like your thinking @arschmitz
[14:35:35] <arschmitz> i would want the site for the release of 1.5 stable
[14:37:01] <jasperdegroot> I think users prefer good/working demos and docs over a site redesign
[14:37:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot yes demos are first for sure
[14:37:27] <arschmitz> and docs are not optional
[14:37:34] <jasperdegroot> since we don't have that much time, let's just focus on those things before 1.5-stable
[14:37:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot there is a while for stable
[14:37:50] <arschmitz> we have not even done alpha yet
[14:37:59] <jasperdegroot> I know
[14:38:23] <arschmitz> and docs should be done by the people who made the changes so kinda unrelated
[14:38:48] <arschmitz> i think you and cogwurx  should focus on demos then site
[14:39:06] <arschmitz> apsdehal gabrielschulhof  cgack we should all be focusing on docs / bugs
[14:39:13] <cogwurx> right on...
[14:39:18] <apsdehal> sure
[14:39:45] <arschmitz> im going to focus on finishing the changelog and upgrade guide
[14:39:47] <arschmitz> then docs
[14:39:48] <jasperdegroot> we also have a themeroller that needs to be updated
[14:39:56] <cogwurx> what's left on demos for the design? I know I have one minor fix to do, if I can get git to cooperate
[14:40:01] <jasperdegroot> and I don't know about the download builder
[14:40:02] <cgack> arschmitz: will do. I'm afk all next week, but I'll dig into the docs/bugs for things when I return
[14:40:13] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot download build wont be happening most likely
[14:40:24] <arschmitz> which brings up next topic
[14:40:40] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof you have an old PR open to make the build work from command line
[14:40:44] <arschmitz> we are going to need this
[14:40:55] <arschmitz> since download builder is currently a bust
[14:41:30] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8067
[14:41:51] <gabrielschulhof> Boy!
[14:42:37] <gabrielschulhof> That's an old one.
[14:42:43] <arschmitz> if we can at least have a command line build
[14:42:55] <arschmitz> that relieves a lot of the need for the download builder site
[14:43:09] <arschmitz> we still want it to get fixed but thats sadly a lot of work
[14:43:14] <arschmitz> in other repos
[14:43:27] <gabrielschulhof> Well, my intention was to make a command line build work via some magical download builder so we only ever have one order of inclusion.
[14:43:47] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof right but thats not going to happen as planned in time
[14:43:53] <arschmitz> so i think that PR could address it
[14:44:10] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, so we have what we have and we need that PR.
[14:44:20] <arschmitz> yup
[14:44:31] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I can have another look at it.
[14:44:49] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof thanks might be easyest to just cherry-pick your commits that matter at this point
[14:45:08] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, probably.
[14:45:16] <gabrielschulhof> Though we haven't touched the build system much.
[14:45:24] <arschmitz> no but that because of rebase
[14:45:30] <arschmitz> has lots of unrelated commits in it
[14:45:56] <arschmitz> it should have 5
[14:46:02] <arschmitz> but has 27
[14:46:17] <arschmitz> just because 1.5-dev was rebased
[14:46:26] <arschmitz> at some point since last year lol
[14:46:30] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, I see that.
[14:46:49] <gabrielschulhof> OK, I'll see what the common base is and rebase.
[14:46:59] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof i would just cherry pick those 5 commits
[14:47:02] <arschmitz> to 1.5-dev
[14:47:12] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so I should just rebase/land that PR?
[14:47:17] <arschmitz> do a range cherry-pick
[14:47:27] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof maybe do another PR
[14:47:30] <arschmitz> or update that one
[14:47:34] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll do that.
[14:47:52] <arschmitz> im not sure you want the add DB to package.json either
[14:48:03] <arschmitz> i think that was you going to try to start switch to new builder
[14:48:52] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof but lets use that as a starting point for anything else we need to do to support a decent command line build
[14:50:01] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, dang! That's right.
[14:50:04] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:50:19] <gabrielschulhof> ... and it adds the boilerplate which we've already added.
[14:50:30] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so not gonna happen in five minutes.
[14:52:30] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:52:43] <arschmitz> id say that should be priority after selectmenu
[14:53:14] <gabrielschulhof> /o
[14:57:57] <gabrielschulhof> Alright. I need to take off. L8R all!
