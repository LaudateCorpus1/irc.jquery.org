[09:02:29] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:02:46] <DaveMethvin> hellow everyone!
[09:06:39] <gibson042> yyyyyyyyyo
[09:06:44] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:06:54] <DaveMethvin> you and timmy are the only ones around,
[09:07:02] <DaveMethvin> i'm just updating the minutes
[09:07:08] <DaveMethvin> in case people want to know what's going ont
[09:08:02] <gibson042> ok
[09:09:52] <DaveMethvin> just got in on a red eye about two hours ago
[09:10:39] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 any 1.8 priorities that you think haven't been fixed?
[09:11:01] <timmywil> I'll have a blog post for next monday
[09:11:13] <gibson042> I don't think so
[09:11:25] <DaveMethvin> so how does next monday sound for a beta2?
[09:11:28] <gibson042> there's still time to make it smaller, but we really seem to be feature complete
[09:11:32] <gibson042> +1
[09:11:40] <DaveMethvin> we can shoot for that
[09:11:44] <gibson042> oh, hang on
[09:11:47] <DaveMethvin> mainly i need to look at the pull q
[09:11:57] <gibson042> right
[09:12:02] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/836
[09:12:03] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (5d, 22h ago): Fix #11971: force starting points of numeric animations to be numeric
[09:12:23] <gibson042> that should definitely go in, because it fixes an infinite loop
[09:12:56] <DaveMethvin> those kind of loops tend to take a long time, so yeah
[09:13:12] <DaveMethvin> imma go thru the pull queue and will prolly land most of that
[09:13:34] <gibson042> I love the $(html, props) one :)
[09:13:49] <gibson042> "enhance it beyond repair"
[09:13:53] <DaveMethvin> hey if scott likes it then i'm good with it
[09:14:10] <timmywil> I mean, it's better, but I'll probably never use it
[09:14:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah it just gets more dangerous to use on large projects
[09:14:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: everything faster in IE7 as well :DDDD
[09:14:50] <DaveMethvin> witchcraft!
[09:15:31] <timmywil> timmy may explode.
[09:16:25] <DaveMethvin> oh wrong window
[09:16:30] <DaveMethvin> anythign you guys want to add?
[09:16:32] <DaveMethvin> that's it for me
[09:16:34] <gibson042> timmywil: can you summarize the changes? I skimmed the diff, and it looks like iterating over that first set of elements for match/no-match rather than iterating over the selector parts
[09:16:37] <gibson042> right?
[09:18:24] <timmywil> gibson042: basically, the performance gain comes form this: with any given selector, it is guaranteed to only loop over the set of elements once (except for POS selectors which are still 3 times faster). It compiles a function containing functions for each part of the selector that is run over each element.
[09:19:03] <timmywil> our performance is now very competitive with NWMatcher and dojo, and blows qwery out of the water.
[09:19:12] <gibson042> allright, cool :D
[09:19:17] <gibson042> you da man
[09:19:29] <timmywil> thanks dawg :)
[09:19:39] <timmywil> gibson042: feel free to look it over and make it smaller :)
[09:20:04] <DaveMethvin> ok imma close the meeting then, thanks guys
[09:20:05] <timmywil> keeping readability in mind tho
[09:20:08] <timmywil> kk
[09:20:09] <gibson042> yep
[09:20:12] <gibson042> see you in -dev
