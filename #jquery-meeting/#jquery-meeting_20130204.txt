[09:02:45] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:03:00] <mikesherov> .
[09:03:02] <orkel> .
[09:03:15] <DaveMethvin> agenda is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:04:01] <DaveMethvin> i'll give folks a second to show up
[09:05:49] <DaveMethvin> hokay
[09:06:04] <DaveMethvin> so i think testswarm started to resurrect itself
[09:06:16] <DaveMethvin> i saw a good run for the migrate plugin a few minutes ago
[09:06:28] <DaveMethvin> i am hoping we can get a good testswarm run
[09:06:46] <DaveMethvin> and for some reason the firefox browsers are complaining about the focus tests again
[09:06:54] <DaveMethvin> so imma look at that
[09:07:13] <DaveMethvin> is there anything that needs to go into 1.9.1 that isn't there yet?
[09:07:46] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1155
[09:08:05] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1152
[09:08:35] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1147 maybe
[09:09:39] <orkel> Currently working on this suggestion https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1147#discussion_r2798248
[09:10:21] <DaveMethvin> i am kinda scared of landing any more test changes before 1.9.1 so that's why i said maybe :D
[09:10:55] <orkel> gibson042 says he wanted to land it today
[09:11:13] <DaveMethvin> as long as it works ...
[09:11:20] <orkel> not yeat :-)
[09:11:26] <DaveMethvin> oh and as long as testswarm can run it
[09:11:32] <DaveMethvin> which seems to be iffy
[09:12:00] <DaveMethvin> okay build issues
[09:12:23] <DaveMethvin> i think we might as well limp along with the grunt we have until 0.4.0 is really released
[09:12:34] <DaveMethvin> i mean how many more RCs can they do?
[09:13:12] <DaveMethvin> and i'd really like the Chrome guys to reconsider their source map stuff
[09:13:19] <timmywil> here
[09:13:22] <DaveMethvin> using the same syntax as IE @cc_on just seems silly
[09:13:32] <DaveMethvin> they can pick any special char they want
[09:13:42] <DaveMethvin> also the use of // comments makes me uneasy
[09:13:48] <DaveMethvin> since it needs to be terminated by a newline
[09:14:45] <DaveMethvin> jquery 2 beta ... any objections to a beta2 later this week?
[09:14:55] <DaveMethvin> let people try out the new .data() stuff
[09:15:20] <timmywil> was there a ticket for that?
[09:15:55] <DaveMethvin> which, the data stuff?
[09:16:07] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:16:07] <timmywil> I'm thinking we should postpone that and release 1.9.1
[09:16:20] <DaveMethvin> 1.9.1 is today
[09:16:27] <DaveMethvin> barring some problem
[09:16:37] <DaveMethvin> 2.0 will be later this week
[09:16:38] <timmywil> oh right, this is only 2.0, ok
[09:16:42] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:16:53] <timmywil> well, we still need a place for discussing the data changes
[09:17:11] <timmywil> julian made some good points
[09:17:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah it was originally landed during all the initial 2.0 changes but backed out
[09:17:23] <orkel> why?
[09:17:34] <DaveMethvin> there was a bug with ie9
[09:17:46] <DaveMethvin> rick fixed that and landed it
[09:17:52] <orkel> ok
[09:18:17] <timmywil> brb
[09:18:22] <DaveMethvin> but to timmywil's point if there are suggestions, would that best be done on the commit?
[09:18:39] <DaveMethvin> not sure
[09:18:49] <DaveMethvin> that's where we've started the discussion
[09:18:50] <rwaldron> timmywil see the notes
[09:19:00] <rwaldron> I'm working on performance optimizations
[09:19:35] <DaveMethvin> we didn't have tickets for all the other refactors/removals so I'd just use the commit
[09:19:56] <DaveMethvin> and it sounds like rwaldron is addressing some of them, we can comment on the pull request when it arrives
[09:20:28] <DaveMethvin> ok...benchmarks...that's just a fyi, i don't know if siovene will come up with anything but it's good to have someone trying
[09:20:39] <DaveMethvin> he seemed enthusiastic about it
[09:21:02] <rwaldron> timmywil, the "suggestion" to use the "module pattern" is not one that really deserves much discussion
[09:21:58] <DaveMethvin> i put some of the open tickets there so we could do a quick triage
[09:22:07] <DaveMethvin> just to make sure none of them belonged in 1.9.1
[09:22:14] <DaveMethvin> 13380
[09:22:29] <jaubourg> plop, sorry to be late
[09:22:47] <DaveMethvin> np jaubourg, we were just on the last agenda item :D
[09:22:52] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:22:55] <jaubourg> that late?
[09:22:57] <jaubourg> :P
[09:23:02] <DaveMethvin> no we're THAT FAST
[09:23:08] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13380
[09:23:27] <DaveMethvin> i think this one is probably an attr/prop thing?
[09:23:42] <DaveMethvin> he's comparing it to 1.4.2
[09:23:49] <gibson042> same here; going over what's been said so far
[09:23:49] <rwaldron> I dont see a test case
[09:24:03] <DaveMethvin> and we can't tell if his code snippet html tag has a lang attr
[09:24:06] <DaveMethvin> i suspect it doesn't
[09:24:24] <DaveMethvin> so not critical
[09:24:24] <jaubourg> rwaldron: you got the general gist of my comment on the data rewrite in 2.0? I was watching the superbowl so I typed it fast and dirty ;)
[09:24:25] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13379
[09:24:54] <rwaldron> jaubourg, yes and I'm working on some performance optimization tweaks
[09:24:56] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: not sure why the guy wants the scripts in the html
[09:25:17] <DaveMethvin> just a sec, package
[09:25:27] <gibson042> 13380 is almost certain .attr that should be .prop
[09:25:34] <jaubourg> rwaldron: the main problem is we got from a O(1) complexity to a O(N) complexity, N being the number of nodes having data in the document :/
[09:25:40] <rwaldron> jaubourg yes
[09:26:15] <gibson042> 13379 I want to see a test case, because it's almost certainly worksforme
[09:26:37] <DaveMethvin> yep another one
[09:26:45] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13378
[09:26:50] <jaubourg> I'm wondering if we didn't get it backward with parseHTML... it seems more and more that we should probably have let $() as is and add a $.select helper to make pure requests... or am I misinterpreting the feedback we had?
[09:27:09] <DaveMethvin> hold that thought for  a sec jaubourg
[09:27:15] <jaubourg> k
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> b/c that would be good to discuss
[09:27:53] <DaveMethvin> so what 13378 is saying is that if the parent window of an iframe has focus, document.activeElement is in the parent?
[09:28:13] <jaubourg> well, it's on file://
[09:28:36] <jaubourg> the test case seems quite convoluted somehow and prone to exhibit bugs outside our reach
[09:29:14] <DaveMethvin> well in any case it's not a (recent) regression and pretty edgy so not a 1.9.1 critical bug
[09:29:48] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13376
[09:30:00] <DaveMethvin> there's two things here
[09:30:10] <DaveMethvin> one is that getting the height triggers a window resize
[09:30:39] <DaveMethvin> the other is that the resize fires DURING the other code
[09:30:50] <jaubourg> are we sure we don't have some console.log lag involved?
[09:31:15] <DaveMethvin> who konws
[09:31:28] <jaubourg> oh, synchronous event fired?
[09:31:55] <DaveMethvin> i'd say this isn't a super critical bug anyway, so we can figure it out after 1.9.1
[09:32:21] <DaveMethvin> those are the only bugs i wanted to do a quick check on
[09:32:28] <DaveMethvin> and none of them look too critical
[09:33:15] <DaveMethvin> but, to the issue with running scripts vs selecting elements you mentioned jaubourg
[09:33:32] <jaubourg> parsing html vs selecting, yes
[09:33:41] <DaveMethvin> i really don't like that we run scripts in content by default
[09:34:12] <jaubourg> that's not what I'm talking about actually, but I don't like we run scripts either... it promotes very bad practices
[09:34:14] <DaveMethvin> driving ppl towards $.parseHTML was one way to make them say "i really want to run scripts"
[09:34:29] <DaveMethvin> but we still run them by default with $() in most cases
[09:34:43] <DaveMethvin> and i think that would be a good candidate for change in the next major release
[09:34:48] <jaubourg> didn't we break $() enough already?
[09:34:53] <jaubourg> ;)
[09:35:07] <gibson042> well jaubourg we already had jQuery.find (returns array) and now we have jQuery.parseHTML (returns array)
[09:35:20] <gibson042> and jQuery is expected to intelligently figure out which to defer to
[09:35:43] <DaveMethvin> well i really dislike that we couldn't come up with some way to make $(null) vs $(NaN) vs $(undefined) behave in completely different ways yet! :D
[09:36:03] <gibson042> though I guess jQuery.find is actually undocumented
[09:36:17] <DaveMethvin> and of course $(new String(" .... "))
[09:36:37] <gibson042> `.trim()`! DON'T FORGET THE `.trim()`!!!1
[09:36:48] <jaubourg> gibson042: I know, but I think we went a bit overzealous with how strict we are when trying and recognizing html... especially given we can find() for edgy cases when html path is chosen when it shouldn't
[09:36:59] <DaveMethvin> anyway, just looking for ways to avoid people accidentally injecting scripts into their code
[09:37:37] <DaveMethvin> and if we had gone the opposite way and said "no scripts" then trimming the input wouldn't be so bad
[09:37:56] <jaubourg> just my 2 cents... I don't remember any complain about a selector being misinterpreted as html but we see the other way around a lot lately...
[09:38:13] <DaveMethvin> there definitely was a ticket about it
[09:38:30] <DaveMethvin> but html that starts with a text node becomes problematic
[09:38:36] <DaveMethvin> so we don't allow it
[09:39:47] <jaubourg> I understand the rationale, I'm just not that sure it justifies the level of breakage we incurred while there was a perfectly fine workaround when a selector was misinterpreted as html
[09:39:53] <DaveMethvin> so if you allow $("text<p>hello</p>") that basically brings you back to the "looks like html" of old, and i don't want to go back there
[09:39:56] <gibson042> see ?9521
[09:39:57] <bot-t> [#9521] XSS with $(location.hash) and $(#<tag>) is needed? (closed bug: fixed in v1.7) - http://jqbug.com/9521
[09:40:01] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:40:02] <gibson042> see ?6429
[09:40:03] <bot-t> [#6429]  (closed bug: wontfix) - http://jqbug.com/6429
[09:41:18] <gibson042> plus, as it is `$("<p>kept</p>not")` discards trailing text nodes
[09:41:27] <timmywil> jaubourg: we did have several tickets about selectors misinterpreted as html
[09:41:53] <gibson042> err, disregard that last
[09:42:43] <DaveMethvin> so here is a possible two-step alternative that might cause less pain ... does it make sense? 1) Ignore leading space before checking for HTML  in 1.9.1  2) broadcast that in 1.10/2.1 you'll need to $.parseHTML to run script
[09:42:59] <DaveMethvin> so #1 basically is saying timmywil was right
[09:43:02] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:43:11] <timmywil> wapow
[09:43:20] <DaveMethvin> #2 is addressing the problem of running script by accident
[09:43:22] <jaubourg> I think it would make sense
[09:43:37] <jaubourg> also, random thinking
[09:43:39] <jaubourg> again
[09:44:12] <jaubourg> do we absolutely need to have 1.9 synced with 2.0... I was thinking 1.10/2.0 1.11/2.1 would make a lot more sense and be simpler to figure out for people
[09:44:32] <gibson042> jaubourg +9001; I was going to propose the same thing
[09:44:37] <jaubourg> and it would allow us to deal with the discrepancies we have so far in a meaningful fashion
[09:44:57] <timmywil> wow, that's brilliant
[09:44:59] <gibson042> err, wait
[09:45:27] <gibson042> I was actually going to propose skipping 1.10 to have 1.11 synchronized with 2.1, but your way might be better
[09:45:52] <jaubourg> I don't see the interest in having "desyncs .x"
[09:46:01] <DaveMethvin> well it all depends on what gets updated when
[09:46:10] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking we wouldn't see 1.10 for a year
[09:46:23] <DaveMethvin> we normally add features on a .x
[09:46:26] <DaveMethvin> 1.x
[09:46:29] <jaubourg> we could have 2.0 before 1.10... it would give us a good idea at what to converge to in 1.10
[09:46:40] <DaveMethvin> we'll definitely have 2.0 before 1.10
[09:46:53] <DaveMethvin> but like, a month from now
[09:47:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: another way to look at it is we could make minor behavior changes
[09:47:00] <DaveMethvin> so that means it's out of sync for 10 months
[09:47:01] <jaubourg> it's just that 2.0 => 1.9, 2.1 => 1.10 doesn't make sense
[09:47:13] <jaubourg> 2.0 => 1.10, 2.1 => 1.11 does
[09:47:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: like the one for :visible
[09:47:46] <DaveMethvin> i definitey think there will be minor bug fixes and changes that aren't in full sync
[09:47:50] <DaveMethvin> no matter what
[09:48:06] <DaveMethvin> i think that's okay
[09:48:12] <timmywil> sure, but there are things we want changed sooner than 10 months that we could make now in 2.0
[09:48:16] <DaveMethvin> it's more about the big differences, particular the api
[09:48:20] <jaubourg> probably, but I'm more concerned with making the life of users simple by having meaningful version numbers that correspond to one another
[09:48:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah i guess we need to look at the particular tickets though, right?
[09:48:50] <jaubourg> "what version of 1.x do I need to be equiv to 2.2? 1.12!"
[09:49:20] <timmywil> jaubourg: yea, that's helpful
[09:49:26] <DaveMethvin> oh, i see what you're saying
[09:49:32] <DaveMethvin> just to keep the numbers similar
[09:49:35] <jaubourg> yep
[09:49:38] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:49:44] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:49:52] <jaubourg> :)
[09:50:13] <DaveMethvin> now, as for what we should do for something like "don't run scripts by default in $()"
[09:50:28] <jaubourg> hunt down people?
[09:50:35] <DaveMethvin> lol i'm for that
[09:50:36] * jaubourg hides
[09:50:55] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: but in order to align them, I'm saying we could release 1.10 sooner and just make it a smaller release that doesn't necessarily have extra features, but does have behavioral changes that we want in 2.0.
[09:51:25] <DaveMethvin> we could do that ... probalby still want to release 2.0, then let things settle for a while and do 1.10
[09:51:42] <timmywil> yea, ok
[09:51:53] <timmywil> also, +1 on not running scripts
[09:52:01] <jaubourg> the order is not that important as long as the correspondance in intuitive
[09:52:08] <DaveMethvin> ok let me put together some sort of proposal for what we discussed here and run it around in an email
[09:52:09] <jaubourg> s/in/is
[09:52:26] <jaubourg> k, sorry but I have to fly right now
[09:52:35] <DaveMethvin> as far as 1.9.1 goes did we discuss anything?
[09:52:56] <DaveMethvin> like should we ignore leading whitespace and get this fixed in 2.0/1.10?
[09:53:58] <gibson042> I don't think we should change that; jquery-migrate already gives back leading text nodes
[09:54:10] <gibson042> all-whitespace and otherwise
[09:54:44] <DaveMethvin> ok, and the safe/right thing to do is pass thru $.parseHTML
[09:55:01] <DaveMethvin> i think i need to do an extended article about $.parseHTML and why ppl need to use it
[09:55:29] <gibson042> yeah
[09:55:29] <DaveMethvin> i still don't think we document that scripts are executed in html, certainly not the quirks of it
[09:55:54] <gibson042> if anything, people seem to be most annoyed by having to wrap parseHTML to get a jQuery collection
[09:56:17] <DaveMethvin> but the good thing is that it is a visual clue
[09:56:35] <gibson042> `$( html )` → `$( $.parseHTML(html) )`
[09:56:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah people don't like typing and "it's ugly"
[09:57:00] <DaveMethvin> just do what i say but of course don't do anything bad
[09:57:42] <DaveMethvin> alright, that's about it for what i wanted to cover
[09:57:45] <DaveMethvin> anything else?
[09:58:06] <gibson042> I think I'm all set
[09:58:51] <DaveMethvin> ok, i'll land the two prs and wait for orkel on the third one
[09:59:00] <DaveMethvin> everyone back to -dev!
