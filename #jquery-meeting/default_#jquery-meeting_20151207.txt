[12:02:32] <timmywil> gibson042, m_gol, markelog, DaveMethvin|away https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BadwSO6Sn91RBfr05s77r81ncEi0oMBJ5mZS-k215vg/edit#
[12:02:42] <markelog> hey-hey
[12:02:56] <gibson042> who's ready for another week of fun and excitement?
[12:03:05] * timmywil this guy
[12:03:09] <markelog> me, me!
[12:04:53] <m_gol> present
[12:05:45] <timmywil> mentionbot seems good to me, but I was getting notifications for everything anyway
[12:05:58] <timmywil> so, it doesn't really affect me
[12:06:18] <m_gol> same for me
[12:06:30] <m_gol> this bug tracker is low volume enough that I can watch the repo
[12:07:01] <timmywil> For 2.2-stable, I'm in the middle of verifying. Started this morning.
[12:07:18] <timmywil> I've already found a few things, but I'll comment on the issue with all of my findings.
[12:07:33] <markelog> what things?
[12:07:45] <timmywil> Let me finish first :)
[12:07:57] <timmywil> we can talk in -dev after
[12:08:02] <timmywil> nothing major
[12:08:38] <timmywil> Has there been progress on 1.12?
[12:08:41] <markelog> did anyone else check it out?
[12:09:34] <markelog> can't start on it, until we could verify the 2.2, since there might be some commits that could be included in 1.12, but might inappropriate for this release
[12:10:02] <markelog> so i would be doing double amount of work otherwise
[12:10:28] <timmywil> Are you thinking of starting with compat and reverting?
[12:11:29] <markelog> yeah
[12:11:34] <markelog> but it depends
[12:11:44] <markelog> if there would be an easier way i will choose it
[12:11:52] <timmywil> ok, well I should have something for you later today
[12:12:20] <markelog> cool
[12:12:36] <markelog> although deadline is already lost
[12:12:37] <markelog> twice
[12:12:56] <timmywil> yea, need to get on it
[12:13:05] <markelog> m_gol: did you had the opportunity to fix opera failures
[12:13:08] <markelog> ?
[12:13:55] <m_gol> markelog: no, sorry, the last week was very bad with time for me; I'm switching jobs and it got very time-demanding
[12:14:05] <markelog> oh
[12:14:08] <markelog> better gig?
[12:14:43] <m_gol> yeah, but still looking in progress
[12:15:01] <markelog> i'm in the same boat man :-)
[12:15:16] <markelog> will you have time on this week?
[12:15:41] <m_gol> I surely hope so, it shouldn't be as bad as last week
[12:16:17] <timmywil> DaveMethvin|away still away?
[12:16:50] <markelog> timmywil:gibson042: don't want to be pushy, but are deadline for 3.0 is coming up
[12:16:55] <timmywil> Well, first, is anyone opposed to landing those first 2 PRs (grammer and https)
[12:17:07] <markelog> timmywil: left couple comments there
[12:17:19] <markelog> i think you can unite them together, for the clean commit history
[12:17:35] <timmywil> markelog: you can be pushy, but I'm not sure what you're pushing
[12:17:43] <markelog> we need those show/hide changes
[12:17:50] <gibson042> I love that "grammar" is misspelled in the title of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2757
[12:18:07] <markelog> not a native speaker
[12:18:14] <timmywil> yes, right, grammar. I can't spell either, apparently.
[12:18:34] <timmywil> *speell
[12:18:40] <markelog> since deadline is january 12
[12:18:53] <markelog> we need to be sure lodash can release on the same day
[12:18:56] <gibson042> yes, nothing on show/hide yet but it's still in the works and on track for that release
[12:19:00] <markelog> and more importantly we can too
[12:19:28] <markelog> also, we could search for the projects in the same situation
[12:20:29] <markelog> did we communicate with other projects?
[12:20:42] <timmywil> some
[12:20:51] <markelog> like what?
[12:22:34] <timmywil> Dojo 2, UI, Qunit 2.0, and Globalize won't support IE8, jdd is PR'ing prototype, requirejs will keep IE8 support
[12:23:01] <markelog> cool!
[12:23:15] <timmywil> and mootools will be IE10+ after 1.6.0
[12:23:20] <markelog> did anyone of those projects can meet the deadline?
[12:24:54] <timmywil> jdd is delaying his lodash 4 release until jan 12, so that will be ready. I think Globalize is already lacking any IE8-specific fixes. QUnit 2/UI will be end of Jan
[12:25:19] <markelog> so we are the only ones (aside from lodash) that will release on january 12?
[12:25:28] <timmywil> But Microsoft is talking about having a page with logos for all of these libraries, at least announcing their intention to drop IE8
[12:25:51] <markelog> oooh
[12:26:24] <markelog> yeah, even if some of those projects are not gonna drop ie8 support on that date, they could say they soon will drop it
[12:26:32] <timmywil> exactly
[12:26:52] <m_gol> timmywil: that's really cool!
[12:27:00] <markelog> ok-ok, if you don't mind, can you keep me (us) post it on it?
[12:27:32] <timmywil> sure
[12:27:35] <markelog> cool
[12:27:56] <timmywil> Microsoft is still working out the details, but that's the idea so far
[12:28:00] <markelog> so what about show/hide? Any approximation for the pr?
[12:28:50] <timmywil> gibson042 maybe this week or next?
[12:29:11] <gibson042> I'll say definitely by next week, maybe this week
[12:29:28] <timmywil> great
[12:29:48] <timmywil> and we'll punt on the Deferred exceptions for now with Dave being absent
[12:30:06] <markelog> we sure we are doing that, right?
[12:30:18] <markelog> is there any libs that do the same?
[12:30:27] <markelog> we can follow an example, if any
[12:30:29] <gibson042> I'm still against it
[12:30:32] <timmywil> I'd like to discuss again with Dave here
[12:30:35] <gibson042> agreed
[12:30:36] <markelog> me too, btw :-)
[12:30:57] <markelog> i wouldn't want to invent something that is not accepted by the community
[12:31:13] <timmywil> anything else for today?
[12:31:35] <m_gol> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2757 is almost ready
[12:31:36] <markelog> you will finish up with 2.2 changes review today?
[12:31:42] <m_gol> gibson has a good remark
[12:31:46] <timmywil> markelog: yup! right after this meeting
[12:31:57] <markelog> cool!
[12:32:07] <timmywil> m_gol: cool, thanks
[12:32:10] <markelog> if anyone else would check it, that would be appreciated
[12:32:29] <timmywil> thanks all, have a good week
[12:32:30] <markelog> gibson042: there is come "complicated" merges of your commits
[12:32:30] <gibson042> I wanted to talk about the https PRs
[12:32:38] <timmywil> oh sure
[12:32:45] <timmywil> what about it
[12:32:46] <markelog> would be cool if you can check it out, if you have some time
[12:32:59] <markelog> they are mentioned in the issue
[12:33:22] <gibson042> the biggest change seems to be in the banner
[12:34:25] <gibson042> I'm cool with the change; how does everyone else feel?
[12:34:36] <timmywil> I'm fine with it as long as the link works
[12:34:42] <markelog> checked the links
[12:34:52] <markelog> we need to remove moongoose though
[12:35:00] <markelog> it seems project is no longer supported
[12:35:03] <markelog> also
[12:35:08] <markelog> there is two docs pr
[12:35:14] <markelog> i would unite them together
[12:35:55] <gibson042> I'm fine with keeping them separate
[12:35:59] <timmywil> fair enough, but like m_gol  pointed out, we can do the mongoose removal in a separate PR
[12:36:00] <gibson042> commits are cheap :)
[12:36:12] <markelog> yeah, but commit history might tough
[12:36:18] <markelog> i learned while doing the 2,2
[12:36:30] <markelog> i'm all for clean commit history
[12:36:40] <gibson042> they're independent
[12:36:46] <markelog> who?
[12:36:49] <timmywil> yea, I think they have different focuses
[12:36:54] <gibson042> no conflicts between the two PRs
[12:37:05] <markelog> i mean the other thing
[12:37:09] <timmywil> grammAr and links
[12:37:29] <gibson042> right, that's one to fix during the merge
[12:37:40] <markelog> the more there commits that aren't important, the more things you need to check
[12:37:40] <timmywil> ah
[12:38:02] <timmywil> markelog: hopefully, we won't have to do what we're doing with 2.2/1.12 again
[12:38:02] <markelog> they all about docs, everything else could be mentioned in the commit body
[12:38:27] <markelog> yeah, but commit history is used all the time
[12:38:31] <timmywil> still, I'd prefer to keep them separate
[12:38:35] <markelog> when we search for bug, fix, etc
[12:38:39] <markelog> ok-ok
[12:38:44] <markelog> if you guys insist :-)
[12:38:55] <markelog> but that is what i mean
[12:39:02] <markelog> with separate commits
[12:39:10] <markelog> we will have three commits that all about docs
[12:39:29] <markelog> which, in my opinion, aren't useful
[12:39:40] <markelog> on the other thing
[12:39:41] <m_gol> that doesn't bother me, it's better to have a commit that's purely about the protocol change, it's easier to see the actual changes then
[12:39:48] <timmywil> commits should be atomized by purpose
[12:39:48] <m_gol> IMO
[12:39:52] <m_gol> yeah
[12:40:23] <markelog> timmywil: it is important to not lead to the absurd with that stuff
[12:40:31] <markelog> okay,
[12:40:49] <markelog> timmywil: after you verify the 2.2 changes, are you gonna start drafting the blog post?
[12:41:36] <timmywil> yes, but I'll be working on that more as we get closer to a release
[12:42:10] <markelog> right, you can work on the main part of the blog post though
[12:42:17] <timmywil> true
[12:42:31] <timmywil> I can do that
[12:42:34] <timmywil> ok, thanks all!
[12:42:50] <markelog> wait
[12:42:55] <timmywil> lol
[12:43:09] <markelog> last time we used github handles, when writing the blog post
[12:43:16] <markelog> seems as a good practise
[12:43:27] <timmywil> oh sure, yea, I think we should do that again
[12:43:33] <markelog> coolsies
[12:43:38] <markelog> okay, that is it :-)
[12:43:45] <timmywil> okay
[12:43:48] <timmywil> see you in -dev
[12:43:50] <markelog> see ya!
