[09:00:59] <DaveMethvin> where the posse at?
[09:01:37] <DaveMethvin> m_gol timmywil gibson042 markelog____
[09:01:48] <timmywil> hola
[09:01:50] <markelog____> hey-hey
[09:01:52] <DaveMethvin> NOW you can say something
[09:01:58] <gibson042> hi
[09:02:15] <gibson042> here, but unfortunately not with full attention
[09:02:25] <DaveMethvin> just half mast?
[09:02:46] <DaveMethvin> hokay
[09:02:47] <gibson042> yeah, approximately
[09:02:55] <DaveMethvin> ba dum pum
[09:03:19] <DaveMethvin> alrighty
[09:03:30] <DaveMethvin> so let's start with the fun stuff
[09:03:48] <DaveMethvin> i'm going to step back a bit and let timmywil drive core, and gibson042 is going to lead sizzle
[09:04:02] <DaveMethvin> that way i can focus on the jquery foundation stuff
[09:04:09] <markelog____> wow
[09:04:13] <DaveMethvin> so congrats timmywil and gibson042 !
[09:04:18] <markelog____> congrats!
[09:04:28] <arthurvr> congrats!
[09:04:50] <timmywil> thanks :)
[09:04:56] <gibson042> thank you :)
[09:05:19] <DaveMethvin> i'll still be around if you need me, and can do some tickets etc
[09:05:30] <DaveMethvin> but i'm going to let those guys make all the hard decisions
[09:05:51] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: do you still plan to attend this meeting regularly?
[09:05:56] <DaveMethvin> i will try to do that
[09:06:08] <DaveMethvin> also i thought i could help out with the docs for 3.0
[09:06:20] <DaveMethvin> so poor arthurvr will have to deal with me more
[09:06:29] <arthurvr> agghrrrr
[09:06:31] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:06:36] <arthurvr> ;-)
[09:06:41] <DaveMethvin> he's been around long enough to know
[09:07:29] <DaveMethvin> so i think i'll just hand off to timmywil, i had a couple of things on the agenda already but mainly you guys will
[09:07:37] <DaveMethvin> want to figure out the stuff left for 3.0 or whatever
[09:07:45] <DaveMethvin> IT'S YOUR MEETING!
[09:08:30] <DaveMethvin> oh one thing near the bottom i can clarify
[09:08:54] <DaveMethvin> i talked to julian ... forgot his last name
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> the velocity guy
[09:09:15] <DaveMethvin> if we're interested in using it he's up for doing the integration
[09:09:21] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at how compatible it is
[09:09:36] <DaveMethvin> but he's very enthusiastic and can make changes if needed
[09:09:40] <gibson042> there are definitely gaps, but we may decide to just drop them
[09:09:55] <DaveMethvin> i can put you in touch with him
[09:10:33] <timmywil> wow, cool, we'll need to look into that
[09:11:18] <DaveMethvin> i can either put you in touch by email or we can open a ticket
[09:11:35] <DaveMethvin> if you want a ticket we could just discuss it there
[09:11:37] <markelog____> why do we want that?
[09:11:37] <timmywil> maybe both?
[09:11:40] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:11:45] <DaveMethvin> i'll do that now
[09:11:58] <markelog____> i mean https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/master/velocity.js#L582-602
[09:12:26] <markelog____> or
[09:12:26] <markelog____> https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/master/velocity.js#L443-459
[09:12:43] <markelog____> with one diff is velocity uses raf
[09:12:53] <markelog____> which we are now use too
[09:13:28] <markelog____> with no tests
[09:13:40] <gibson042> we don't always use it, though
[09:14:35] <markelog____> what we don't use?
[09:14:55] <DaveMethvin> raf? yeah like ie8
[09:15:08] <DaveMethvin> we now use it when we can
[09:15:10] <markelog____> and velocity does?
[09:15:25] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it supports ie8?
[09:15:30] <markelog____> it does
[09:15:32] <gibson042> us: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/compat/src/effects.js#L648-L652
[09:15:48] <markelog____> yep
[09:15:49] <gibson042> I believe velocity shims rAF
[09:16:02] <gibson042> https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/master/velocity.js#L464
[09:16:16] <markelog____> which is setTimeout
[09:16:19] <gibson042> so actually very similar
[09:16:25] <markelog____> there is no diff at all
[09:16:40] <DaveMethvin> that's good
[09:16:56] <markelog____> so i really don't understand the reason to consider this such drastic changes
[09:17:25] <markelog____> no tests, ua-detection and it uses same methods
[09:17:47] <DaveMethvin> i think that's a legitimate part of the discussion
[09:17:54] <markelog____> we are always advocated to use tests and do feature detection
[09:17:55] <gibson042> the callback model is also different IIRC
[09:18:13] <markelog____> i think this is just marketing stuff
[09:18:44] <DaveMethvin> he contacted me and asked ... their animations are better but i agree some stuff would need to be done before we adopted it
[09:18:48] <timmywil> I'm not that familiar with velocity. what advantages does velocity have over the current animate? Are there use cases that we don't cover? Are there perf tests that demonstrate animate's shortcomings?
[09:18:57] <DaveMethvin> mainly perf as i understand it
[09:19:01] <DaveMethvin> i've seen some demos
[09:19:05] <markelog____> but not anymore
[09:19:05] <timmywil> gotcha
[09:19:08] <markelog____> since raf
[09:19:09] <DaveMethvin> the famo.us folks have some benches
[09:19:12] <markelog____> we use it now
[09:19:21] <DaveMethvin> oh markelog____ you're saying that raf was the main diff?
[09:19:22] <markelog____> i didn't do perf on latest code
[09:19:31] <markelog____> it should be
[09:19:33] <timmywil> well, if raf was the main diff, it may not be worth it
[09:19:47] <DaveMethvin> agreed, but we can let him make the case
[09:19:48] <markelog____> Corey has some thoughts about that
[09:19:58] <markelog____> gnarf: ping
[09:20:03] <timmywil> sure, maybe we can let him present his case over email
[09:20:15] <DaveMethvin> i had talked to gnarf as well
[09:20:23] <DaveMethvin> anyway, just wanted to mention that
[09:20:53] <markelog____> maybe we can improve animation if there is some tricks to make it better, but change everything?
[09:21:04] <markelog____> that seems like a lot
[09:21:12] <gibson042> +1
[09:22:04] <timmywil> I agree, but I think we can discuss it in more detail elsewhere
[09:22:09] <markelog____> ыгку
[09:22:12] <markelog____> sorry
[09:22:13] <markelog____> sure
[09:22:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah, sorry to sidetrack ... definitely not a 3.0 thing anyway :)
[09:22:52] <markelog____> cyrillic keyboard, sometimes it hard to make a switch )
[09:23:02] <timmywil> no problem! Good to talk about it.
[09:23:28] <DaveMethvin> let me hand the wheel back to you timmywil
[09:23:47] <timmywil> ok, I'm just going to go through the agenda you made for us this week. ;)
[09:24:04] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2030
[09:24:17] <markelog____> there is a lot of changes coming in jscs
[09:24:31] <markelog____> like we finally will support parentheses case
[09:24:39] <markelog____> which should be released this week
[09:24:47] <markelog____> but we use fixed deps
[09:24:54] <markelog____> so if we would use that pull
[09:25:02] <markelog____> we would need to make an update again
[09:25:12] <timmywil> gotcha, so maybe we should wait until the next release before doing all the style updates?
[09:25:32] <markelog____> yeah, i will prepare the pr
[09:26:00] <timmywil> awesome!
[09:26:03] <DaveMethvin> it just seemed like ntwb was willing to file a pr with all the fiddly style changes, any time you get a guy willing to do that you pounce on it
[09:26:18] <DaveMethvin> but we can wait and markelog____ can do that with the version update i guess
[09:26:42] <markelog____> sorry, didn't mean to make it look like that
[09:26:54] <markelog____> i remember scott was against that for while
[09:27:05] <DaveMethvin> i think ntwb was just a little sensitive
[09:27:15] <markelog____> so i followed the general idea of waiting on that
[09:27:36] <DaveMethvin> i guess i probably made it worse by asking him for a PR :)
[09:27:43] <timmywil> Unfortunately, it's a little awkward at this point. ntwb seems to have gotten fed up.
[09:27:54] <markelog____> well, code changes were good, he just refused to finish them
[09:27:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, we should leave it alone
[09:28:12] <DaveMethvin> those kind of changes are always tricky to land anyway
[09:28:17] <DaveMethvin> since every PR will be conflicted
[09:28:28] <DaveMethvin> well most of them
[09:28:41] <DaveMethvin> probably better to do right after 3.0 ships
[09:28:47] <DaveMethvin> when the PR queue is small
[09:29:00] <markelog____> so, jscs update only after 3.0?
[09:29:02] <timmywil> yea, even if he did finish another PR, we would probably need to do some cleanup when landing regardless (and possibly keep bugging him about tiny changes).
[09:30:16] <timmywil> yea, I think that's good, get all of necessary changes in for 3.0 before doing a blanket sweep of style changes.
[09:30:45] <markelog____> okay, noted
[09:31:58] <timmywil> ah yes, the hide/show issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/88
[09:32:28] <timmywil> as usual, paul_irish gave us numbers
[09:32:38] <timmywil> happily
[09:33:18] <markelog____> i guess we need to create ticket for methods simplification
[09:33:40] <timmywil> I'd like to see the performance improve, but from what I saw in the profiler, it seemed like most of the time was spent in computed.getPropertyValue
[09:33:57] <DaveMethvin> was that because of a forced layout or something?
[09:33:59] <markelog____> so we can continue discussion in there, since it looks like we leave show example on the page
[09:34:05] <DaveMethvin> i didn't look at it in detail
[09:34:27] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: perhaps, it probably needs further investigation
[09:34:38] <DaveMethvin> yep, sounds like it's best done on the ticket
[09:34:38] <timmywil> interestingly, this does not seem to be related to defaultDisplay
[09:34:48] <markelog____> defaultDisplay is very use case
[09:34:51] <markelog____> )
[09:34:56] <timmywil> ya
[09:35:03] <markelog____> but we need to get styles those methods
[09:35:07] <markelog____> we can dispose from that
[09:35:12] <markelog____> it will be a breaking change
[09:35:19] <timmywil> ok, so we'll keep thrashing on that
[09:35:20] <markelog____> but just might be the right thing to do
[09:35:47] <timmywil> Dave brought up deprecation of jQuery.swap and :hidden/:visible selectors
[09:35:54] <timmywil> Where are we leaning?
[09:36:23] <markelog____> We use swap internally a lot
[09:36:26] <markelog____> right?
[09:36:31] <timmywil> I think I'm fine with it, but it does seem like .is(":visible") is used a lot
[09:36:35] <gibson042> jQuery UI uses :visible and :hidden
[09:36:45] <markelog____> and many other people too
[09:36:55] <markelog____> seems like a popular selector
[09:37:01] <markelog____> but its slow
[09:37:03] <markelog____> obviously
[09:37:17] <timmywil> yea, for swap, the implication would be that we would no longer go through the rigamorole to get non-none values
[09:37:18] <gibson042> I think at minimum it should be build-excludable
[09:38:00] <markelog____> gibson042: easy thing to do, but i guess not a lot of people would use that
[09:38:13] <markelog____> until we have a download builder that is
[09:38:20] <timmywil> what about moving to deprecated.js, but leaving the build?
[09:38:29] <timmywil> although, that doesn't really work for swap
[09:38:36] <gibson042> swap is an undocumented internal helper, so I have no concerns there
[09:39:02] <timmywil> yes, but it affects documented behavior of .css (I think)
[09:39:04] <gibson042> we'll keep it until we don't need it
[09:39:06] <markelog____> yeah, but its there for the begining, some people might still depend on it
[09:39:35] <markelog____> there is a lot of articles that mentioned that method
[09:39:44] <timmywil> actually, I don't see a mention of it in css docs
[09:39:44] <markelog____> so there is certain risks
[09:39:52] <gibson042> then we can explicitly contravene them in a beta blog post
[09:39:59] <markelog____> yeah
[09:40:19] <markelog____> timmywil: i mean on out there, not on api.jquery.com
[09:40:29] <timmywil> sure
[09:40:29] <markelog____> like "hidden jQuery" or something
[09:40:32] <markelog____> )
[09:40:41] <timmywil> yea, I think I've actually blogged about it myself
[09:40:45] <timmywil> woops!
[09:40:51] <markelog____> )
[09:41:22] <gibson042> it's also really tiny
[09:41:32] <gibson042> and without dependencies
[09:41:32] <timmywil> ok, it seems like we're leaning towards not deprecating swap, but what about :hidden/:visible?
[09:41:51] <markelog____> popularity against performance
[09:41:59] <markelog____> which would win?
[09:42:01] <markelog____> )
[09:42:30] <timmywil> Perhaps we could leave it, but write a blog post about the performance implications of using it
[09:42:34] <markelog____> there is might be use-cased where those selectors are handy, but people often doesn't use them right
[09:42:40] <DaveMethvin> some of those examples paul_irish has are pretty bad, it's sad that people misuse them
[09:42:57] <timmywil> true enough
[09:43:02] <markelog____> do we mention this stuff in the docs?
[09:43:06] <DaveMethvin> it's just that .is(":visible") is SO easy to miunderstand
[09:43:25] <DaveMethvin> i have a presentation where show the diff between is(".visible") and .is(":visible")
[09:43:31] <DaveMethvin> it's pretty bad
[09:43:39] <timmywil> we do mention that it doesn't go through qsa
[09:43:42] <timmywil> but that's about it
[09:43:56] <markelog____> yeah, one just a class another is reflow in some cases
[09:44:10] <markelog____> we can add it to the docs plus a blog post
[09:44:14] <DaveMethvin> at the very least i think some docs improvements
[09:44:15] <markelog____> or
[09:44:17] <markelog____> you know
[09:44:19] <markelog____> depreacated it )
[09:44:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: absolutely
[09:45:01] <markelog____> maybe not just a note, but couple examples of misuse
[09:45:02] <DaveMethvin> deprecated doesn't mean removed, but it does give us reasons for putting warnings in jquery migrate
[09:45:15] <DaveMethvin> not sure we have the same reason if it's not deprected
[09:45:24] <timmywil> Ok, how about we deprecate, but leave it in the build. I know that's weird for some.
[09:45:38] <timmywil> what dave said
[09:46:39] <gibson042> I think reasons for deprecating are independent of reasons for advising avoidance
[09:47:16] <DaveMethvin> i guess we never formally deprecated stuff like :input either
[09:47:21] <gibson042> I mean, their presence hurts us only in code size
[09:47:37] <markelog____> which is not a big right?
[09:47:38] <DaveMethvin> well, also perf
[09:47:42] <markelog____> perf!
[09:48:04] <gibson042> perf is only impacted when someone uses them
[09:48:09] <markelog____> ))
[09:48:11] <timmywil> lol
[09:48:16] <gibson042> and we don't use them internally
[09:48:28] <gibson042> it's not like there's a big cost to jQuery itself
[09:48:33] <DaveMethvin> right but by making them avail we lead people to think they're okay
[09:48:39] <DaveMethvin> like we used to with $.browser
[09:48:53] <gibson042> it just seems like a "use with caution" case
[09:48:59] <DaveMethvin> and that was REALLY popular
[09:48:59] <markelog____> it seems we just might use something slower internally in show/hide
[09:49:08] <gibson042> which honestly goes for _all_ non-standard selectors
[09:49:27] <DaveMethvin> the big killer for :visible is that it forces layout
[09:49:32] <DaveMethvin> :input doesn't
[09:49:51] <DaveMethvin> it's like a whole nother level of hurt
[09:50:02] <markelog____> is that the case even in modern browsers?
[09:50:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah if layout is dirty
[09:50:13] <markelog____> i remember oldie was pretty bad at it
[09:50:29] <DaveMethvin> it has to reapply styles for example
[09:50:39] <DaveMethvin> so if you addclass followed by a check for visible, bam
[09:51:13] <timmywil> I think it's even worse than that
[09:51:23] <timmywil> any calls to offsetWidth trigger a recalc
[09:51:52] <markelog____> that was the case a was hinting about
[09:52:03] <markelog____> but even in modern browsers?
[09:52:17] <DaveMethvin> well just switch to getBoundingClientRect ... solved!   :))))
[09:52:21] <timmywil> yea, even there, but they can be fast enough that it's not visible
[09:52:26] <timmywil> GET IT?
[09:52:46] <markelog____> ))
[09:52:50] <timmywil> that's another option
[09:53:03] <timmywil> try to improve :visible
[09:53:11] <timmywil> but we've been changing that one since the beginning
[09:53:14] <timmywil> never quite right
[09:53:58] <markelog____> how about we start from the note in the blog post and docs update while creating a ticket for improval?
[09:54:38] <timmywil> Ok, well, we should probably move on. We'll start with updating the docs and see where we are next week.
[09:55:36] <timmywil> So, we've got 35 open issues for 3.0
[09:55:48] <timmywil> with only about 6 or 7 unassigned
[09:55:59] <timmywil> If you think you have time, grab one of those.
[09:56:06] <timmywil> Are there any issues anyone would like to bring up here?
[09:56:12] <markelog____> yeah
[09:56:16] <markelog____> shadow dom
[09:56:22] <markelog____> do we support it now?
[09:56:26] <DaveMethvin> QUICK CLOSE THE MEETING
[09:56:28] <DaveMethvin> LOL
[09:56:29] <markelog____> )
[09:56:33] * timmywil hides
[09:56:55] <DaveMethvin> specifically that one ticket markelog____ ?
[09:56:57] <gibson042> I don't think we can fully support it yet
[09:57:05] <gibson042> too much is out of whack in the specs
[09:57:09] <markelog____> yeah, i remember there was one
[09:57:19] <DaveMethvin> agreed about support in general
[09:57:23] <gibson042> but the offset one, I'm for
[09:57:24] <DaveMethvin> it was about position
[09:57:28] <DaveMethvin> offset yeah
[09:57:39] <DaveMethvin> it seemed easy enough
[09:57:43] <markelog____> gibson042: why? Is there something bad happending there?
[09:58:02] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2043
[09:58:12] <gibson042> can you clarify, markelog____?
[09:58:35] <markelog____> well, if we don't support it, why we want to add support it for one specific case?
[09:59:12] <markelog____> there a lot more issues
[09:59:15] <gibson042> I _want_ to support it
[09:59:16] <markelog____> and they all freaky
[09:59:24] <timmywil> I don't think we need to wait until recommendation status, but if the spec is flucuating and more changes are expected, I'd like to see us limit changes only to the ones that require very little code, just to get the little stuff out of the way to pave the way for later.
[09:59:32] <gibson042> yes
[09:59:48] <markelog____> i saw the polymer code for full support of it
[10:00:00] <markelog____> and its not pretty
[10:00:08] <DaveMethvin> i don't think the standards guys have fully thought this through
[10:00:16] <markelog____> like a lot of code and performance issues
[10:00:33] <DaveMethvin> it's like, "we want to hide" but then "we need to see"
[10:00:38] <gibson042> I'm particularly concerned about the shadow DOM boundary
[10:00:44] <DaveMethvin> yes
[10:01:09] <markelog____> jquery might grow a lot and start to have perf descrease
[10:01:15] <timmywil> If we punt on that, there should probably be a mention about why in the blog post.
[10:01:21] <gibson042> that's why I'm still case-by-case on it
[10:01:24] <timmywil> But I'm in favor of punting
[10:01:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[10:01:35] <gibson042> but in favor of fixing offset so it works when completely within Shadow DOM
[10:01:43] <DaveMethvin> and point out the issues with the standard right now
[10:01:44] <gibson042> which it currently doesn't
[10:01:53] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[10:02:15] <DaveMethvin> this one in particular is an easy fix
[10:02:15] <timmywil> gibson042: agreed, if it doesn't add a significant size increase
[10:02:25] <DaveMethvin> but its all case by case
[10:02:39] <timmywil> sounds good, any other issues?
[10:02:40] <gibson042> timmywil: it will in fact come with a size reduction if we're willing to throw exceptions from invalid input
[10:02:54] <timmywil> gibson042: great!
[10:02:57] <markelog____> what would be limitation, when should we refuse to add someting and accept?
[10:03:13] <DaveMethvin> probably just discuss each pr or issue
[10:03:17] <timmywil> markelog____: we'll just take it one issue at a time
[10:03:21] <markelog____> okay
[10:03:24] <DaveMethvin> they can't even agree on syntax
[10:03:31] <DaveMethvin> now the piercer is >>>
[10:03:32] <markelog____> one more thing
[10:03:33] <markelog____> just one!
[10:03:35] <markelog____> )
[10:03:42] <markelog____> when do we shedule the release?
[10:03:53] <timmywil> Now that's a good question
[10:03:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah timmywil ? :)
[10:03:58] <timmywil> haha
[10:04:03] <DaveMethvin> whew
[10:04:14] <timmywil> I SEE HOW IT IS
[10:04:19] <DaveMethvin> sucker!
[10:04:27] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: what were you thinking?
[10:04:32] <markelog____> i guess there data and promises stuff to land, right?
[10:04:33] <DaveMethvin> first thing would be the beta, right?
[10:04:36] <markelog____> the important ones
[10:04:50] <DaveMethvin> gotta get the breaking changes and features in
[10:04:58] <timmywil> absolutely, we need all breaking changes and new features in
[10:04:59] <markelog____> jquery-release is ready for semver?
[10:05:03] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: jinx
[10:05:34] <timmywil> yea, I've got jquery-release working for major updates
[10:05:43] <markelog____> cool!
[10:05:51] <markelog____> we can land promises stuff right?
[10:05:58] <markelog____> nothing holding us up?
[10:06:04] <markelog____> gibson042:.
[10:06:05] <timmywil> I think so
[10:06:19] <gibson042> I've got a decent handful of new features and at least one breaking change (.show ignoring cascaded display), but all are far smaller than Deferred
[10:06:20] <markelog____> and you take the data stuff?
[10:06:31] <timmywil> I'm going to say yes. We can always make more changes after the beta, but the bulk of it needs to get in.
[10:07:39] <timmywil> If you've got small bug fixes tickets too, those aren't as high priority.
[10:07:56] <markelog____> timmywil: but breaking changes should go in beta
[10:07:59] <gibson042> if no one has comments on the tests or deprecation/backcompat/etc. decisions for deferred, then it's basically ready
[10:08:01] <markelog____> only in beta
[10:08:03] <timmywil> markelog____: yes
[10:08:36] <DaveMethvin> gotta run now ... thanks and congrats!
[10:08:37] <markelog____> gibson042: didn't check them out, could you give me time until day after tomorrow?
[10:08:42] <gibson042> sure
[10:08:50] <markelog____> okay, cool
[10:09:29] <timmywil> Ok, we'll work out an actual date to shoot for next week.
[10:09:34] <timmywil> Thanks everybody!
[10:10:04] <timmywil> oh, but I'm thinking within the next 2-3 wekks
[10:10:32] <timmywil> if that's not feasible we'll move it
