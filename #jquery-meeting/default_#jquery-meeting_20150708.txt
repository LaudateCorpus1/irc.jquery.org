[09:01:44] <fnagel> hey
[09:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hey fnagel. I started the datepicker merge.
[09:02:25] <fnagel> great news!
[09:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm running into some problems with Globalize and the locales.
[09:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> Need to work through it with rxaviers when he's around.
[09:03:00] <fnagel> there are issues with localization, for which we need to update globalize
[09:03:31] <jzaefferer> here now
[09:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> One of the problems is that datepicker is using Globalize 1.x and spinner is still using 0.x.
[09:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> But they co-exist, so we need to handle that.
[09:04:16] <jzaefferer> Well, we do have the PR to update spinner
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> Another problem is that localization.js expects a global for Globalize.
[09:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> But the tests all run through AMD now.
[09:04:29] <fnagel> mhhh datepicker uses a alpha version of 1.0
[09:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Oh, so let's work on getting that landed in master.
[09:05:24] <jzaefferer> I don't see it on the PR page though - did we close it?
[09:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see the PR though.
[09:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember seeing any PR for spinner using Globalize 1.x
[09:05:51] <fnagel> Not sure what to do with spinner but Im fine when you udate the demos and the tests to work more or less. Issues with localization and similar will be fixed later on by me
[09:06:06] <jzaefferer> Maybe I was confusing it with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1341
[09:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> And this merge will enable that to finish.
[09:06:54] <fnagel> right
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Will you be around after the dev leads meeting?
[09:07:17] <arschmitz> here sorry
[09:07:25] <jzaefferer> I can be
[09:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if rxaviers isn't around, maybe you can help figure it out.
[09:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> Since you have more background with Globalize.
[09:08:05] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz landed the position update for jquery-git breakages.
[09:08:38] <fnagel> I need to leave early (at clients office)
[09:08:39] <arschmitz> yup
[09:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> What's the status of AMD in demos?
[09:09:18] <jzaefferer> that should be pretty much done now
[09:09:22] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: had made a comment about a global no longer being needed i fixed
[09:09:56] <jzaefferer> I would like to test these within the (updated) jqueryui.com
[09:10:16] <jzaefferer> since we won't see the changes live until the final release; beta doesn't update demos...
[09:10:49] <arschmitz> yeah i was having trouble deploying them again
[09:10:53] <arschmitz> locally
[09:10:59] <jzaefferer> testing anything related to jqueryui.com is still problematic, though I think the last time I got pretty far
[09:11:44] <jzaefferer> and we now have the option to use a local, existing UI repo
[09:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> I just rip out the download portion to test :-P
[09:11:53] <arschmitz> i did
[09:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> Though I guess demos rely on that to some extent now.
[09:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we don't have an update for CSS dependencies, right?
[09:12:50] <jzaefferer> I'll try again and nag you guys when I get stuck
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> And we already talked about datepicker merge.
[09:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[09:13:20] <arschmitz> splitting up core
[09:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah.
[09:13:25] <jzaefferer> Button review?
[09:13:29] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: suggested us using folders
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get to button review as soon as datepicker is merged.
[09:13:47] <arschmitz> we should decide what sort of folder structure we want
[09:14:06] <jzaefferer> I suggested a few names besides "core" :-)
[09:14:13] <arschmitz> yes
[09:14:20] <jzaefferer> shared, utils, platform, helpers, plugins, tools...
[09:14:30] <jzaefferer> Pick two!
[09:14:54] <arschmitz> even though its more work there is widgets also which is what mobile has
[09:15:01] <arschmitz> well we have a lot of folders but yeah
[09:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, perhaps these new files stay at the "root"
[09:15:24] <scott_gonzalez> And we move widgets and effects?
[09:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be a breaking change though.
[09:15:45] <arschmitz> that would be similar to what mobile does
[09:15:52] <arschmitz> yes it would
[09:16:06] <arschmitz> but splitting core unless we leave a file named core
[09:16:09] <arschmitz> is breaking
[09:16:25] <arschmitz> and have that just require all the individual files
[09:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we were going to have a core file that included everything for back compat.
[09:16:36] <jzaefferer> actually, didn't we want to keep a core.js file that requires everything it used to contain?
[09:16:49] <arschmitz> ok
[09:16:51] <jzaefferer> cute
[09:17:02] <arschmitz> i can add that its not there now
[09:17:21] <scott_gonzalez> Read the description in http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9647
[09:17:40] <arschmitz> yup ill add that
[09:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> So widget.js would stay in the root, right?
[09:18:11] <jzaefferer> So, folders?
[09:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> And the individual widgets would move to a widget folder.
[09:18:22] <arschmitz> yes
[09:18:30] <arschmitz> same with effects
[09:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> I want to split effects core as well.
[09:18:53] <arschmitz> ok
[09:18:54] <jzaefferer> i18n stays?
[09:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> Class animation, easings, etc.
[09:18:58] <arschmitz> i can do that at the same time
[09:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll stay for one more release.
[09:19:12] <jzaefferer> for now anyway
[09:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> Then it'll get deleted :-)
[09:19:19] <arschmitz> if im going to update all the tests and everything thing else might as well do it all in one go
[09:19:44] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:19:48] <jzaefferer> I guess that'll require more DB changes then
[09:19:55] <arschmitz> yup
[09:20:05] <jzaefferer> hopefully just prefixing one line with "widget/"
[09:20:38] <arschmitz> yeah i have to look but should be simple
[09:20:52] <jzaefferer> Well, the 1.12 packer PR isn't done anyway
[09:21:06] <arschmitz> yeah that will need to update
[09:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[09:25:22] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:25:30] <jzaefferer> Looks like we got the remaining work well distributed :-)
[09:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks everyone.
