[14:14:26] <cogwurx> hello!
[14:14:35] <agcolom> hey :-)
[14:14:46] <agcolom> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1314647570
[14:14:55] <arschmitz> apsdehal: sfrisk gabrielschulhof jasperdegroot cgack
[14:14:57] <gabrielschulhof> Hey, all!
[14:14:58] <agcolom> I've updated the PR and Issue numbers
[14:14:59] <sfrisk> hey
[14:15:02] <apsdehal> hi
[14:15:03] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:15:07] <gabrielschulhof> agcolom: Awesome!
[14:15:09] <cogwurx> cgack is doublebooked today
[14:15:40] <cogwurx> told me to let you know that: " I just started looking at api docs for navbar if they want an update"
[14:15:44] <apsdehal> I am working on phantomjs issue at the moment. Stuck with requirejs errors
[14:15:57] <apsdehal> Mostly issue is with requirejs versions
[14:16:08] <arschmitz> cogwurx: execlent thank yo
[14:16:17] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:16:17] <cogwurx> welcome
[14:16:28] <arschmitz> lets start with the big one for the moment select menu
[14:16:32] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: any updates
[14:16:47] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. It should be good to go. As for the related toolbar issue, I would suggest we leave it for now.
[14:16:52] <gabrielschulhof> That is, adding the option.
[14:17:21] <gabrielschulhof> It's not as simple as it sounds, and the toolbar /does/ work as it is, you just have to put it in a page before you instantiate it to avoid making all pages relative.
[14:17:37] <agcolom> I've added cgack's update to the notes.
[14:17:51] <gabrielschulhof> selectmenu works correctly because it attaches the toolbar first and then instantiates it.
[14:17:59] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ok didnt see a comment but ill review and fingers crossed we can land that and move back to master this week
[14:18:14] <agcolom> arschmitz: feel free to move somewhere else in the doc, I'm not too sure where it fitted (should it be under 1.5 blockers?)
[14:18:32] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes
[14:18:44] <agcolom> ok, I'll put under there
[14:19:09] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, sorry, I tried the toolbar thing so that's why I didn't update the labels.
[14:19:14] <arschmitz> ok cogwurx jasperdegroot any updates on demos
[14:19:18] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no problem
[14:20:25] <jasperdegroot> no, nothing to report
[14:20:44] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, BTW: view seems to be updating slowly, if at all.
[14:20:52] <cogwurx> no updates. I've not worked on anything since updating the CSS a few weeks ago. Not sure if there is anything for me to work on at the moment
[14:21:16] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: there are infra issues
[14:21:22] <arschmitz> that would cause that most likely
[14:21:26] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:21:26] <arschmitz> they are working on it
[14:21:33] <gabrielschulhof> Good to know it's a known problem.
[14:21:39] <jasperdegroot> cogwurx: anything in the demos issues ticket
[14:22:12] <jasperdegroot> just let others know if you're working on something
[14:22:27] <jasperdegroot> to prevent two people working on the same
[14:22:39] <cogwurx> right on...I'll take a look at those
[14:23:15] <jasperdegroot> great, thanks
[14:23:23] <cgack> sorry i'm late
[14:24:30] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Do you think you could have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8428? Only if it's an easy fix. I looked at it briefly, but I know you did toolbar so you may see a path more easily than I can.
[14:25:00] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: It's about adding an option to the toolbar to assume that it's part of a page, or assume it's outside a page, or (default) detect whether it's part of a page.
[14:25:25] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: The motivation is that we should be able to create a toolbar in a floating piece of DOM and then attach it.
[14:25:58] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: But if it turns into a quagmire, you can certainly remove the milestone and the blocker flag, IMO.
[14:26:31] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: ... because toolbars are not broken because of that issue, and you can work around by attaching first and then instantiating.
[14:26:43] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Hi!
[14:26:44] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[14:26:46] <arschmitz> if we cant fix for 1.6
[14:26:52] <arschmitz> i mean 1.5
[14:26:58] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, exactly.
[14:26:59] <arschmitz> we need to add a note to the api about it
[14:27:04] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[14:27:11] <cgack> i'll take a look
[14:27:16] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Thanks!
[14:28:06] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: The basic reason we need the option is so pages aren't set position: relative because the toolbar thinks it's not part of a page at _create(), even though you then proceed to insert it into a page.
[14:29:04] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: i see. I'll look at it and see if it is something quick, or if we punt to later
[14:29:23] <arschmitz> cgack: it can even go in after the alpha
[14:29:43] <cgack> arschmitz: awesome. when is alpha?
[14:29:50] <arschmitz> as soon as possible
[14:29:52] <arschmitz> lol
[14:29:57] <cgack> :)
[14:29:59] <arschmitz> if we get selectmenu in this week
[14:30:09] <arschmitz> then its just docs blocking us
[14:30:41] <gabrielschulhof> Here's hoping ...
[14:31:09] <arschmitz> becuase the alpha wtih out docs is kinda useless no one will know what to do or has changed
[14:31:28] <arschmitz> but once we merge to master im going to do a blog post
[14:31:33] <cgack> surely they can figure it out on their own ;)
[14:31:38] <arschmitz> so that will buy us some time on docs
[14:31:50] <arschmitz> couple weeks at least
[14:32:30] <gabrielschulhof> What about using data-ui-* in the demos?
[14:32:40] <gabrielschulhof> We /are/ going for that in 1.5, right?
[14:32:59] <gabrielschulhof> ... or is that something we can fix in beta?
[14:33:29] <gabrielschulhof> Beta I guess, right?
[14:33:49] <arschmitz> it can be fixed in beta
[14:33:54] <arschmitz> and yes demos should use data-ui
[14:34:24] <gabrielschulhof> I smell a | sed coming on sometime in the beta timeframe.
[14:34:33] <arschmitz> yes most likely
[14:34:56] <cgack> :)
[14:35:33] <arschmitz> we should have backcompat set to false in demos
[14:35:42] <arschmitz> to make sure we are only using non deprecated code
[14:36:19] <arschmitz> we sould not demo anything deprecated
[14:37:05] <cgack> arschmitz: what about demos for re-implementing deprecated things with things like classes option?
[14:37:24] <arschmitz> as long as it does not use anything deprecated its good
[14:37:32] <cgack> right on.
[14:37:41] <arschmitz> but like collapsible demos should just be removed now
[14:39:12] <cgack> here's another question: what are the biggest docs issues... i know navbar and table had rewrites, everything else got classes....more ui widgets... what else?
[14:39:12] <cgack> should we make a master issue that has a checklist on the  api.jquerymobile repo?
[14:40:09] <arschmitz> all the widgets have major changes
[14:40:21] <arschmitz> adding classes option
[14:40:24] <arschmitz> removing bool options
[14:40:37] <arschmitz> *bool style options
[14:41:06] <arschmitz> i dont think there is any widget that does not have major api surface changes
[14:41:53] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, and we've dropped initSelector, right?
[14:41:58] <arschmitz> yes
[14:42:05] <gabrielschulhof> So, now you need to always specify role(s).
[14:42:13] <arschmitz> yup
[14:42:26] <arschmitz> so i cant say there is a spcific place thats more important then others
[14:42:34] <gabrielschulhof> I think dropping deprecation in the demos will be a thorough reminder of what we need to update in the API docs.
[14:42:36] <arschmitz> though the changes will be very similar in most places
[14:43:06] <arschmitz> like marking corners deprecated and saying use classes
[14:43:09] <arschmitz> on almost every widget
[14:43:19] <arschmitz> add classes on every widget
[14:43:29] <arschmitz> etc
[14:43:51] <gabrielschulhof> We can do that with an include.
[14:44:01] <arschmitz> yes
[14:44:04] <arschmitz> if its the same
[14:44:19] <arschmitz> like corners we can but classes it self we cant
[14:44:51] <arschmitz> we dont have any docs for accordion
[14:44:53] <gabrielschulhof> Right, yeah, I guess for classes we need to document all keys.
[14:45:01] <arschmitz> buttton checkbox radio and control group need to point to ui
[14:45:12] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yup
[14:46:09] <cgack> so... plenty to do :)
[14:46:14] <arschmitz> yup
[14:46:26] <arschmitz> things that can be shared
[14:46:30] <arschmitz> like corners
[14:46:37] <arschmitz> who ever does that should just do all the widgets at once
[14:49:12] <agcolom> It'd be good to get all the options in etc, and I'm happy to review and check wording
[14:49:28] <gabrielschulhof> I need to set up the environment on this laptop.
[14:50:13] <cgack> thats a question I had. what is the environment for api docs. I've never messed with them locally.
[14:50:43] <arschmitz> cgack: there should be instructions in the root of the repo and on contribute to set them up
[14:51:11] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[14:51:30] <arschmitz> cgack: http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/
[14:51:53] <cgack> so api.jquerymobile.com runs through that. I see. thanks. lets hope vagrant.jquery.com on windows behaves
[14:53:23] <arschmitz> cgack: it probably wont
[14:53:32] <arschmitz> cgack: most people need to change a bios setting for it
[14:53:54] <arschmitz> cgack: if you have trouble let me know and ill see about finding you the links to get it working
[14:54:25] <cgack> arschmitz: i might just get my mac running it an not worry about it on windows
[14:54:35] <cgack> but if i do, i'll hit you up
[14:54:39] <arschmitz> cgack: either way
[14:54:45] <arschmitz> what ever is easiest for you
[14:58:11] <arschmitz> ok i think thats our time for today
[14:58:23] <arschmitz> just want to mention we got 2 GSoC students
[14:58:44] <gabrielschulhof> Yes. I'm a mentor for apsdehal and one other.
[14:58:53] <cgack> \o/ rad!
[14:58:56] <gabrielschulhof> Gonna go hunt some bugs!
[14:59:01] <arschmitz> apsdehal: will be working with us again through GSoC so he will have a lot more time for the summer
[14:59:11] <arschmitz> and hes working on reducing the issue count
[14:59:24] <arschmitz> we also got another who will hopefully be able to join us next week
[14:59:38] <arschmitz> who will work on adapting us to use hammer.js
[15:00:25] <apsdehal> I will be free during this summer, so I can also pick up any extra pending tasks
[15:00:40] <arschmitz> so that will be good cant complain about about 2 people paid to work for us full time for the summer :-)
[15:01:37] <gabrielschulhof> No, sir! Never!
[15:01:44] <gabrielschulhof> This is great!
[15:04:08] <arschmitz> ok
[15:04:15] <arschmitz> see everyone back on dev
[15:05:10] <gabrielschulhof> L8R all!
