[09:02:26] <timmywil> HI
[09:02:34] <DaveMethvin> O HAI
[09:02:47] <rwaldron> hey dudes
[09:02:54] <DaveMethvin> so engrossed in editing the agenda i forgot about the meeting :?
[09:02:57] <gnarf> omg meeting!
[09:03:24] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig: are you around?
[09:03:45] <DaveMethvin> not even sure what continent he's on
[09:03:55] <DaveMethvin> we all need gps
[09:04:09] <timmywil> .seen JohnResig
[09:04:12] <hsbot> JohnResig was seen 18 hours, 6 minutes and 30 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: OK
[09:04:21] <gnarf> OK!
[09:04:27] <gnarf> 1.7
[09:04:38] <timmywil> yes
[09:04:40] <gnarf> I think my last two open bugs can probably be punted to 1.8
[09:04:52] <timmywil> agreed
[09:04:56] <gnarf> docs#8627
[09:04:57] <bot-t> [#8627] .animate() fails on letterSpacing in IE (regression in 1.5.1) (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/8627
[09:05:05] <gnarf> docs#8498
[09:05:05] <bot-t> [#8498] Animate Hooks (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/8498
[09:05:15] <rwaldron> i just sliced my finger open
[09:05:20] <gnarf> there will probably be a better (extenstion based) solution
[09:05:21] <gnarf> in 1.8
[09:05:22] <DaveMethvin> ow
[09:05:28] <rwaldron> so, i'm going to be running back and forth for a sec
[09:05:46] <timmywil> stop typing with knives in your hand
[09:05:54] <rwaldron> no kidding right?
[09:05:56] <gnarf> i do have an issue that isn't on trac yet
[09:06:05] <DaveMethvin> NO ADDING TO THE PILE
[09:06:08] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:06:08] <gnarf> .stop( clearQueue, gotoEnd, queueName )
[09:06:13] <gnarf> shitty api
[09:06:15] * gnarf slaps self
[09:06:17] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah .stopQueue?
[09:06:25] <timmywil> ahh, yes
[09:06:29] <timmywil> yea, that's bad
[09:06:52] <gnarf> .stopQueue( queueName, clearQueue, gotoEnd )
[09:07:01] <DaveMethvin> in three more versions we'll have .stop(true, false, null, NaN, "myQueue")
[09:07:09] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: JohnResig said he wasn't going to be able to make it to the meeting. or didn't think he could, at least.
[09:07:16] <timmywil> i don't think it's worth adding another function so I'd rather check type string
[09:07:21] <gnarf> stop({ queue: "name", clearQueue: true })
[09:07:30] <timmywil> maybe that
[09:07:31] <gnarf> timmywil: queue: false is the issue
[09:07:43] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: your appearance reminds me i need to add an item to the agenda
[09:07:45] <gnarf> with typeof string
[09:07:51] <timmywil> yea i know, I'm okay with not passing false for queue in stop
[09:08:01] <timmywil> is there a point to that?
[09:08:08] <gnarf> timmywil: stop unqueued anims?
[09:08:25] <gnarf> stop transitions
[09:08:27] <timmywil> ah, separately
[09:08:36] <timmywil> well, ugh
[09:08:37] <gnarf> keep the queue going yes
[09:08:43] <gnarf> but kill the unqueued ones
[09:08:44] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: ah yes. thx.
[09:08:54] <gnarf> the object isn't so bad
[09:09:09] <timmywil> yea, that's probably the best idea so far
[09:09:26] <gnarf> anyone else?
[09:09:30] <DaveMethvin> so an object, to stop the madness of more args?
[09:09:37] <gnarf> heh
[09:09:45] <gnarf> DaveMethvin has a point there
[09:09:54] <gnarf> i dunno
[09:09:55] <timmywil> also do typeof string?  i'd like to do .stop('myQueue')
[09:10:10] <gnarf> i think the typeof string is the best bet
[09:10:11] <DaveMethvin> which is easy enough to test
[09:10:32] <gnarf> and then the only way to stop unqueued is to stop all
[09:10:54] <timmywil> i mean, there is a usecase for passing false for queue, but I'm not sure how clear that is that it will stop all unqueued animations
[09:10:57] <gnarf> right now stop ONLY stops everything
[09:11:13] <gnarf> it doesn't differentiate
[09:11:19] <gnarf> meaning 1.6...
[09:11:51] <gnarf> so like, adding the ability to limit it to a single queue is a huge boon
[09:12:29] <DaveMethvin> i'm good with whatever
[09:12:36] <gnarf> its more about stoping a queue tho
[09:12:53] <gnarf> in my mind
[09:12:53] <timmywil> what about typeof string and adding .stop("unqueued") or something
[09:13:07] <gnarf> .stop( null )
[09:13:12] <gnarf> ?
[09:13:25] <DaveMethvin> lol, wait until you have to document this
[09:13:32] <timmywil> heh, yea
[09:13:45] * DaveMethvin hides from kswedberg
[09:13:55] <kswedberg> ha
[09:14:46] <DaveMethvin> well simple is good, if .stop("queuename") can do the trick then great
[09:14:56] <timmywil> ok, well, since we need a decision for 1.7, I'd say go ahead and make a pull to do typeof string (that's really what it should be for custom queues) and we can figure out the queue: false problem
[09:15:17] <gnarf> sounds good
[09:15:25] <gnarf> i'll whip up a pull this afternoon
[09:15:37] <kswedberg> twss
[09:15:46] <gnarf> ?hi5 @kswedberg
[09:15:46] <bot-t> kswedberg, ‚Åµ
[09:15:46] <timmywil> haha
[09:16:09] <DaveMethvin> alright
[09:16:26] <DaveMethvin> so it sounds like we're gonna push the box-model stuff to 1.8 as well
[09:16:47] <timmywil> agreed
[09:16:48] <kswedberg> makes sense
[09:16:59] <timmywil> my remaining tix will be in this week.  they're easy
[09:17:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you have two blockers
[09:17:32] <timmywil> xhtml and mousewheeel
[09:17:43] <DaveMethvin> the xhtml one i think we're going to punt
[09:18:06] <timmywil> kk
[09:18:08] <DaveMethvin> it sounds like we'll need to redo the unit tests to dynamically generate the doctype and header
[09:18:10] <DaveMethvin> yuck
[09:18:16] <timmywil> eek
[09:18:25] <DaveMethvin> mousewheeeeeel i was working on last night
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> brandon added the mousewheel vars to the global list and we've taken them off
[09:18:54] <DaveMethvin> so i wanted to make a pull he could release
[09:19:07] <DaveMethvin> but i was having probs with ie7 so i need to circle back today
[09:19:39] <timmywil> are those core changes or just changes to his plugin?
[09:20:16] <DaveMethvin> just in his plugin i think
[09:20:24] <timmywil> cool
[09:20:32] <DaveMethvin> the plugin just needs to copy over the vars itself
[09:20:58] <DaveMethvin> so of the stuff still marked 1.7, what can/will/should be done?
[09:21:35] <DaveMethvin> the docs#8545 is more of a reminder for me to go through and make sure I didn't cause (more) leakage in IE with the event rewrite
[09:21:36] <bot-t> [#8545] Leak with events in IE (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/8545
[09:21:54] <DaveMethvin> i'll check that one this week
[09:22:11] <timmywil> as I said, I'll get all 3 of mine done
[09:22:23] <timmywil> docs#9945
[09:22:25] <bot-t> [#9945] Percentage Width Elements in Hidden Divs (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9945
[09:22:27] <gnarf> what about the unassisgned
[09:22:32] <timmywil> that could probably be 1.next
[09:22:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah just looking at that
[09:23:22] <gnarf> i'm at a loss how we'd even fix that
[09:23:24] <timmywil> for docs#5145, we could just remove that $ and be done with it
[09:23:28] <bot-t> timmywil, #5145 (jQuery.support.opacity = false in the Chrome browser ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5145
[09:23:49] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: agreed, seems that simple
[09:23:52] <timmywil> it's not really important that it's anchored anyway
[09:24:18] <timmywil> i'll take that then
[09:24:34] <gnarf> should that be 0.55 or 0\.55
[09:24:45] <DaveMethvin> no it should be unescaped dot
[09:24:50] <DaveMethvin> that way it matches dot or comma
[09:24:52] <gnarf> just checking :)
[09:25:02] <rwaldron> docs#9941 is either going to be easy, or wont-fix
[09:25:03] <bot-t> [#9941]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9941
[09:25:16] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then i think we are okay on these bugs
[09:25:46] <gnarf> docs#10067
[09:25:47] <bot-t> [#10067] Firing $.ready on document.readyState === 'interactive' too (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/10067
[09:26:11] <DaveMethvin> that also seems like an easy fix, although changing anything like that makes me nervous
[09:26:34] <DaveMethvin> one of those things that is really hard to test
[09:26:42] <DaveMethvin> and can cause subtle problems
[09:26:56] <DaveMethvin> thoughts?
[09:27:19] <timmywil> requirejs does that manually. looks like this is just about supporting the async attribute
[09:27:57] <DaveMethvin> well in any case it's not a blocker
[09:28:01] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg isn't here, i talked to him about the isProgressing thing
[09:28:03] <timmywil> true
[09:28:07] <rwaldron> i mostly hate that idea
[09:28:15] <rwaldron> for the same reasons
[09:28:21] <rwaldron> ...nervous
[09:28:25] <DaveMethvin> the boolean vars with the Promise states are out of  hand
[09:28:46] <DaveMethvin> we have a multi-state object and multiple booleans to tell you what it is
[09:29:03] <timmywil> .state
[09:29:07] <DaveMethvin> exactly
[09:29:07] <timmywil> i like that
[09:29:12] <gnarf> .state()
[09:29:13] <kswedberg> +!
[09:29:21] <rwaldron> +1
[09:29:25] <DaveMethvin> plus factorial from kswedberg
[09:29:31] <timmywil> gnarf: doesn't even need to be a function
[09:29:32] <kswedberg> heh. woops
[09:29:38] <gnarf> timmywil: it does
[09:29:41] <timmywil> as long as it is updated
[09:29:48] <timmywil> why?
[09:29:52] <gnarf> timmywil: copying to other promises
[09:30:01] <DaveMethvin> ok then, we'll add state() and then discourage use of isResolved and isRejected
[09:30:02] <gnarf> etc
[09:30:21] <DaveMethvin> and won't add isPending to discourage that ugly trend
[09:30:28] <timmywil> gnarf: it's specific to each promise tho
[09:30:30] <DaveMethvin> or isProgressign
[09:30:40] <DaveMethvin> or isJustLyingThereDoingNothing
[09:30:55] <timmywil> oh i see, you want to share it between promises
[09:31:11] <gnarf> timmywil: like when you make a promise it just copies functions from the dfds
[09:31:33] <timmywil> ah, so the deferred would stay updated, but not the promise.  ok sry, got it
[09:31:54] <gnarf> but yeah, booleans out of hand
[09:32:01] <gnarf> +%
[09:32:04] <timmywil> lol
[09:32:21] <DaveMethvin> ok, so let's talk timing
[09:32:41] <timmywil> can we do it by wednesday?
[09:32:47] <DaveMethvin> beta 2?
[09:32:47] <timmywil> beta 2
[09:33:00] <DaveMethvin> sounds doable, of course you have the most stuff timmywil
[09:33:07] <gnarf> i can have stop( "queue" )
[09:33:08] <timmywil> mine are cake
[09:33:09] <DaveMethvin> so yeah i say you can do it:P
[09:33:20] <timmywil> :)
[09:33:40] <DaveMethvin> ok then we'll make another push for ppl to test, i got the feeling we didn't get much testing
[09:33:59] <DaveMethvin> i mean, i totally broke jQuery UI with infinite recursion and there were only two reports
[09:34:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: nah, it's just perfect
[09:34:15] <DaveMethvin> we did get the mousewheel one tho which is good
[09:34:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: that's two more than we got in 1.6b
[09:34:24] <DaveMethvin> alright let's shoot for wednesday
[09:35:03] <DaveMethvin> so i can't remember where the .isNaN suggestion came from but since we don't document it we should be able to swing this
[09:35:19] <gnarf> its really confusing
[09:35:36] <DaveMethvin> the reason we have it is that .isNaN("")===false among others
[09:35:37] <timmywil> it is
[09:35:51] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: it came from our chat in Boston, going through the list of methods
[09:35:58] <DaveMethvin> any probs making this change in 1.7?
[09:36:09] <DaveMethvin> i can do it
[09:36:18] <timmywil> did we search google code?
[09:36:22] <timmywil> huh DaveMethvin ???
[09:36:27] <DaveMethvin> i'll do that LOL
[09:36:40] <DaveMethvin> using my own ninja techniques against me no fair
[09:36:51] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/jquery.color.js#L161
[09:37:08] <gnarf> still in beta
[09:37:11] <gnarf> so whatever :)
[09:37:19] <DaveMethvin> who wrote that crap? :P
[09:37:48] <gnarf> just sayin
[09:37:50] <gnarf> #js
[09:38:39] <DaveMethvin> the SO thread points out it's just isNaN and isFinite so you could use those directly if you wanted to avoid a version dependency
[09:39:05] <DaveMethvin> on to further deprecation ... too soon for that?
[09:39:06] <gnarf> yeah
[09:39:20] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I think we were going to make it more like a real isNumeric and map $.isNaN to $.isNumeric, yeah?
[09:39:36] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice to avoid the mapping if nobody is using it externally
[09:39:50] <kswedberg> nobody but gnarf, yeah. ;)
[09:39:59] * gnarf hides in a corner
[09:40:13] <DaveMethvin> gnarf does all magic so it won't affect him
[09:40:13] <timmywil> it's not just isNaN and isFinite
[09:40:46] <DaveMethvin> the SO thread had some test cases, we've got to be able to do better than a regexp there
[09:41:07] <timmywil> ?eval isFinite("")
[09:41:07] <bot-t> timmywil: true
[09:42:27] <kswedberg> ?eval isNaN("") && isFinite("")
[09:42:27] <bot-t> kswedberg: false
[09:43:06] <DaveMethvin> well it's on the list to look at in any case
[09:43:06] <kswedberg> oops. nm
[09:43:23] <DaveMethvin> so on those hooks...
[09:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: you know you can run the UI test suite against jquery master, right?
[09:43:58] <DaveMethvin> i haven't
[09:44:03] <DaveMethvin> but sure
[09:44:52] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure wev've explained well enough to ppl that we've preserved some amount of backcompat via hooks
[09:45:05] <DaveMethvin> so deprecating the hooks wouldn't say much to users calling .attr() for example
[09:45:34] <timmywil> i don't think we can deprecate the boolHook, but I can think we can deprecate tabIndex and value
[09:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> actually, looks like there are some tests that are failing against master
[09:45:48] <timmywil> -can
[09:46:27] <scott_gonzalez> looks like they're all event related
[09:46:39] <DaveMethvin> oh boy
[09:46:41] <timmywil> in most cases .attr('tabindex') will still be fine because it will only affect the elements that don't have any tabindex attribute
[09:47:15] <timmywil> some people might be surprised to get undefined, but that would be it
[09:47:26] <timmywil> as for value, people really shouldn't do .attr('value')
[09:47:44] <DaveMethvin> agreed, unless they want the value attibute
[09:47:45] <timmywil> that is utterly useless, but could actually be useful if it got the attribute instead
[09:48:37] <timmywil> if ( $elem.attr('value') !== $elem.prop('value') ) { /* value has changed */ }
[09:49:14] <DaveMethvin> although you could look at the defaultValue prop too, right?
[09:49:24] <timmywil> you could
[09:49:38] <DaveMethvin> i agree the attr one looks more obvious
[09:49:43] <DaveMethvin> most ppl don't know about defaultValue
[09:50:23] <DaveMethvin> ok let's move on to docs
[09:50:37] <timmywil> conclusion?
[09:50:54] <DaveMethvin> well how will we deprecate those?
[09:51:06] <rwaldron> Raid
[09:51:07] <DaveMethvin> it's a documentation issue, i am just not sure how to docuement
[09:51:19] <rwaldron> http://www.killsbugsdead.com/home.asp
[09:51:20] <timmywil> we could simply state it in the blog post and docs
[09:51:30] <DaveMethvin> i think that would work
[09:51:46] <DaveMethvin> as far as the docs go i think there's something in attr already?
[09:52:23] <DaveMethvin> nope
[09:52:33] <DaveMethvin> i guess we just had the blog post describing it
[09:52:45] <gnarf> kswedberg: if i want to write up docs for 1.7 stuff, should I just add it to api?
[09:53:14] <gnarf> i gotta put in the stuff about the .queue( function( next, runner ) { runner.stop = function() } ); hook
[09:53:26] <gnarf> and then animate queue option
[09:53:32] <kswedberg> gnarf: if it's a new entry, then put it in api.jquery.com and save as draft.
[09:53:43] <gnarf> its all changes to current stuff
[09:53:56] <kswedberg> ah right.
[09:54:02] <DaveMethvin> it might be handy if we could make the 1.7 changes public before we release final 1.7, in the past I htink we've waited until release day
[09:54:12] <DaveMethvin> what do you think kswedberg
[09:54:41] <gnarf> .stop( [queueName], clearQueue, gotoEnd ) .animate({ queue: "named" }) and .queue( fn( next, runner ) {} ) are my docs changes
[09:54:44] <kswedberg> depends on how big the changes are. with big changes Jaubourg and I usually start in a *pad and then migrate it back over to the wp-admin when we're happy
[09:54:57] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I'd like that, yes.
[09:55:39] <gnarf> kswedberg: so, should I etherpad them, or just inject it into the wp-admin ?
[09:55:49] <gnarf> I'll prolly etherpad anyway
[09:55:57] <gnarf> you're edits are always appreciated :)
[09:56:00] <gnarf> your
[09:56:01] <gnarf> *
[09:56:02] <gnarf> see
[09:56:03] <gnarf> !
[09:56:04] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:56:10] <kswedberg> gnarf: yeah. let's start with etherpad. or oksoclap.
[09:56:18] <kswedberg> lol
[09:56:23] <gnarf> kswedberg: cool, I'll try to have something for you by wed
[09:56:28] <kswedberg> fantastic.
[09:56:56] <kswedberg> .seen Jaubourg
[09:57:00] <hsbot> Jaubourg was seen 1 day, 22 hours and 26 minutes ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Curses! It's the LOLBAT!
[09:57:50] <DaveMethvin> the last 3 items are about deprecating or moving stuff, since we're running short of time how about we push them to next week?
[09:57:52] <DaveMethvin> four
[09:58:00] <kswedberg> I'll have to get together with Julian re documenting .progress() and .state()
[09:58:07] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: good idea.
[09:58:14] <rwaldron> i think jaubourg's girlfriend is in town
[09:58:24] <DaveMethvin> oh damn, now nothing will get done
[09:58:32] <kswedberg> aha!
[09:58:41] <DaveMethvin> frenchmen and their girlfriends
[09:59:12] <kswedberg> so, DaveMethvin, ajpiano, danheberden, and I went through http://test.learningjquery.com/jquery-methods.html the other day and flagged a bunch of stuff as "intentionally undocumented"
[09:59:23] <DaveMethvin> ah good
[09:59:29] <DaveMethvin> alright then, now i can go and figure out what i borked in UI
[09:59:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yes to all of those
[09:59:52] <kswedberg> if anyone has a problem with any of the things flagged that way, bring it up next meeting.
[10:00:12] <DaveMethvin> k sounds good ... we're dunzo?
[10:00:12] <timmywil> let's do it in 1.7.  We don't need to be paranoid about those.
[10:00:28] <kswedberg> dunz
[10:01:19] <timmywil> thanks all
