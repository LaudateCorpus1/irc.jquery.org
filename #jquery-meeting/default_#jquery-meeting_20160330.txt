[12:02:32] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:36] <fnagel> hi
[12:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz and I are going through PRs.
[12:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll see our PR and bug count are slightly lower.
[12:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> We'll continue doing this after the meeting.
[12:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> We've got the checkboxradio and selectmenu issues from last week fixed and merged.
[12:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we don't actually have much that needs to be discussed today.
[12:05:31] <arschmitz> lol
[12:06:11] <fnagel> ;-)
[12:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> We've had a few issues filed for download builder.
[12:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have time to look into those?
[12:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I can after the 1.12.0 release.
[12:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> I plan on spending most of my time on PEP and download builder after the release.
[12:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything to discuss?
[12:15:40] <arschmitz> nothing here
[12:15:55] <fnagel> no
[12:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today then.
