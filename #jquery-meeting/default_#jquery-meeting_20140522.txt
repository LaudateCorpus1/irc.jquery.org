[11:01:50] <agcolom> hi!
[11:01:57] <uGoMobi> hey agcolom
[11:02:06] <arschmitz> hi
[11:02:25] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:03:01] <cgack> hey everyone
[11:03:08] <uGoMobi> hey cgack
[11:03:36] <uGoMobi> we had a meeting about navbar yesterday
[11:04:04] <uGoMobi> cgack will update the ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7359
[11:04:32] <cgack> yep, I already added some stuff from the meeting in there
[11:04:40] <uGoMobi> great
[11:05:03] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:05:38] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:06:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how are the table tests looking?
[11:06:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They were green until I started factoring out the popup.
[11:06:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now I'm working on returning them to their verdant state.
[11:08:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you see that discussion on -dev about breaking table column toggle up into 3 parts?
[11:09:05] <uGoMobi> to me it wasn't clear why it has to be 2 extensions
[11:09:29] <arschmitz> yes i did
[11:09:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why not putting the button and popup code in one extension?
[11:09:45] <_|Nix|_> Because the button is totally separate from the popup.
[11:09:54] <_|Nix|_> In fact, I'm thinking we should deprecate the button altogether.
[11:10:13] <uGoMobi> in favor of... ?
[11:10:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think button should be an option on the popup extension
[11:10:22] <_|Nix|_> It's easy enough to <a href="table-id-popup" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Columns...</a>
[11:10:22] <arschmitz> its just a button its not complicated
[11:10:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[11:10:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so make it an option
[11:10:54] <arschmitz> one extension
[11:11:09] <uGoMobi> that sounds good
[11:11:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... OK. Default true.
[11:11:45] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:11:51] <arschmitz> for backcompt yes
[11:12:31] <_|Nix|_> OK, but if we add an option, then we have to deal with _setOptions() :/
[11:12:43] <arschmitz> yeah that not hard
[11:12:52] <_|Nix|_> I know, but seems kinda superfluous.
[11:12:59] <arschmitz> why?
[11:13:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, c'mon - it's not brain surgery. It's just an anchor, fer cryin' out-loud!
[11:13:33] <arschmitz> right so whats the problem?
[11:14:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem is I really don't see why we should go through all this trouble just for a button. We've had it in 1.4, so, OK, backcompat 'n all that, but I invision the button being an extension akin to filterable.backcompat.js - deprecated and to be removed in 1.6.0.
[11:15:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i need to hear a good reason why we should not generate the button you have not given any reason why to not do it
[11:16:23] <uGoMobi> the table column toggle widget needs a control to function so it doesn't make sense to me to not include that control
[11:16:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its a very simple option that provides a convienence for the developer to be bale to give normal semantic markup for the table
[11:16:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because it's on by default, because it increases code size unnecessarily, because it's super trivial to do on your own, and because, if you want to do something custom, you actually have to use a data-option to turn it off, instead of being able to completely excise it from your build.
[11:16:51] <uGoMobi> it's nice to make it possible to customize though
[11:17:05] <arschmitz> the code increase is trivial
[11:17:17] <arschmitz> the fact that its trivial is part of why we should do it
[11:17:34] <arschmitz> yes but if your doing super custom you should not use data roles
[11:17:43] <arschmitz> you should be calling it yourself
[11:18:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I disagree. We should handle what's difficult, not what's easy. The table exemplifies that excellently. In fact, the API docs say that explicitly.
[11:18:07] <arschmitz> and adding it in your markup actually puts a element in your markup with no semantic menaing until the widget runs
[11:18:26] <uGoMobi> that's a good point
[11:18:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... actually, that's the clincher. It breaks PE.
[11:18:59] <arschmitz> a primary audience of ours is beginers
[11:19:40] <arschmitz> we need to remember making things easy is what we do but we should have options for more advanced use
[11:19:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because now you have a button in your markup which serves no purpose if you're on C-grade. In fact, it confuses.
[11:20:05] <uGoMobi> that's why it's a good idea to make it an extension
[11:20:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[11:20:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. Sold!
[11:20:21] <uGoMobi> but still do the same as now by default
[11:20:23] <arschmitz> and for an advanced user one option difference is nothign
[11:20:24] <_|Nix|_> I'll keep it one extension and make an option.
[11:20:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess an advanced user can use data-enhanced="true" and then omit the button.
[11:21:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: an advanced user should not be using data roles at all and so enhncaed in not needed
[11:21:20] <arschmitz> or would be passed as an option not an atribute
[11:21:52] <arschmitz> i actually think we should add an option to not call enhancewithin in page
[11:22:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: An advanced user can write an extension to page ;)
[11:22:37] <arschmitz> not easily
[11:22:42] <arschmitz> its part of create
[11:22:56] <arschmitz> you should have to copy the whole create and change the one line
[11:23:07] <arschmitz> should/would
[11:23:23] <arschmitz> and options are not always a bad thing if they serve a real use
[11:23:49] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I see it now.
[11:23:57] <arschmitz> like not autoenhancing the page is a totally legit use case i advice it in all my talks on perf
[11:24:12] <arschmitz> but right now we actually make that hard to do
[11:24:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, this.element.enhanceWithin() should be moved to _enhance()
[11:24:33] <arschmitz> it should be its own option seperate
[11:24:51] <arschmitz> just because you want to handle page markup yourself does not mean you want to handle all markup yourself
[11:25:07] <arschmitz> espically since its about calling not markup
[11:25:41] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, OK.
[11:26:07] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, in that case an option makes sense,
[11:26:24] <uGoMobi> +1
[11:26:27] <arschmitz> there are some places like this that i think we do a poor job supporting advanced users
[11:26:46] <arschmitz> and its part of what we catch a lot of flak for on forums and twitter and stuff
[11:26:57] <_|Nix|_> I'll make an issue and milestone it 1.5-2.0
[11:27:10] <arschmitz> beginners love us and rave about us
[11:27:20] <_|Nix|_> ... but then they outgrow us
[11:27:37] <arschmitz> advanced not so much and i can see why adding things like this at strategic points in the library will help in this aspect i think
[11:28:40] <uGoMobi> the enhanced option was a good first step
[11:29:03] <uGoMobi> we will add that to the remaining widgets for 1.5
[11:29:07] <_|Nix|_> Boom! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7416
[11:29:25] <uGoMobi> I suggest we milestone this option 1.6
[11:30:03] <_|Nix|_> Can do.
[11:30:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think 1.5
[11:30:15] <arschmitz> its only adding a single if statement
[11:30:29] <uGoMobi> we have to get rid of that 1.5-2.0 mileston BTW
[11:30:32] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey
[11:30:35] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, and we don't even need to handle _setOptions()
[11:30:39] <uGoMobi> doesn't provide much info
[11:30:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope
[11:31:00] <uGoMobi> I will take care of that
[11:31:03] <_|Nix|_> frequent's giving an introductory course on jQM so I thought we should all praise him some :)
[11:31:12] <frequent> (blush again)....
[11:31:12] <_|Nix|_> Sorry for the interruption!
[11:31:57] * _|Nix|_ pats frequent on the back
[11:32:09] * agcolom me too :-) 
[11:32:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll be more specific
[11:32:33] <frequent> :-)
[11:34:19] <uGoMobi> I don't think there is much else discuss today
[11:34:31] <uGoMobi> I see arschmitz is cranking on PR reviews :P
[11:34:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[11:35:23] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we can land the bug fixes PRs coming week
[11:35:30] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:35:44] <uGoMobi> when arschmitz is done with page events we can release 1.4.3
[11:36:13] <cgack> and we can re evaluate all the tag:navigation issues
[11:36:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: can you look at that pr
[11:36:19] <arschmitz> the demo is not done yet
[11:36:26] <arschmitz> but the code should be good
[11:36:38] <uGoMobi> cgack: yeah
[11:37:18] <uGoMobi> BTW we have a "help wanted" label now
[11:37:52] <uGoMobi> don't change the text of that label
[11:38:39] <arschmitz> im yelling out my self in my pr for my terrible spacing if anyone wants to help yell at my poor code quality :)
[11:38:56] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:38:59] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:39:11] <uGoMobi> that "help wanted" label is an idea of GitHub
[11:39:20] * agcolom has to run to pick up Alex from rock climbing... 
[11:39:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What are the semantics of the help wanted label? Like, basically, inviting people to PR?
[11:39:38] <uGoMobi> it is to help people who wants to contribute to open source but don't know where to start
[11:39:51] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:40:23] <cgack> in that case i'll be using that label exclusively :)
[11:40:32] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:40:47] <_|Nix|_> Do you think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7416#issuecomment-43927020 is sufficient elaboration on what needs to be said about optional .enhanceWithin()?
[11:41:24] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss here today?
[11:41:38] <_|Nix|_> I'm good, I think.
[11:42:04] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Once more, good work, and break a leg ;)
[11:42:06] <frequent> I'm patted and good, too :-)
[11:42:15] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:42:41] <frequent> _|Nix|_: a due need to manage quite a learning curve in the next 3 weeks.
[11:43:01] <_|Nix|_> frequent:
[11:43:05] <_|Nix|_> "a due"?
[11:43:13] <frequent> ?
[11:43:36] <_|Nix|_> frequent: What do you mean by "/a due/ need to manage ..."?
[11:43:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, this can continue on -dev.
[11:43:50] <frequent> ah. due = do
[11:43:54] <uGoMobi> looks like we can wrap up
[11:43:58] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:44:00] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:44:03] <frequent> ok. cu
[11:44:04] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
