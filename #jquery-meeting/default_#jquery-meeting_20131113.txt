[09:00:05] <kborchers> i'm "here"
[09:00:07] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:00:11] <kborchers> i'll be a bit distracted
[09:00:14] <fnagel> here
[09:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> For AMD, we decided not to include the CSS files in the define().
[09:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> We'll juse use comments like Mobile is doing.
[09:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> So rxaviers can make some progress on that when he's around.
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: What's the status of the tooltip a11y PR?
[09:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1118
[09:02:38] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1118 by dylanb (2w 4d ago): Tooltip: Add tooltip content to an aria-live div when the tooltip conten...
[09:03:57] <tj_vantoll> When I tested it things were working fine. Then you had some additional comments.
[09:04:46] <tj_vantoll> As long as you are satisfied with his response to your question it should be good to land.
[09:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> He did answer my questions, so I'll do another pass over the code and see if everything looks good.
[09:06:54] <jzaefferer> here now
[09:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> Anything to discuss about buttons?
[09:07:29] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good. It works, and it looks reasonable to me.
[09:07:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: not really with being gone all last week didnt make much progress
[09:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> That brings us to tabs.
[09:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9518
[09:08:16] <arschmitz> tore out all the checkbox and button set stuff and started to make it work with new markup
[09:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> There's an issue if you have URLs that aren't UTF-8.
[09:08:27] <arschmitz> but not in working form yet will push an update once it is
[09:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> We use decodeURIComponent() which only works with UTF-8 encoding.
[09:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> So if anything is encoded with a different character set, the decoding may throw an error.
[09:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> The person reporting the issue doesn't want this to actually work. He just wants it to not throw an error.
[09:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts?
[09:10:22] <tj_vantoll> Presumably, we'd prevent errors with a try/catch?
[09:10:26] <arschmitz> are there any ideas on how to make it actually work?
[09:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, it's impossible to make it actually work.
[09:10:46] <arschmitz> didnt think so
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> You can't find out the encoding that's being used, and even if you could, there's no method for decoding other charsets.
[09:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'd be a try/catch, but then we'll just see everything as a remote tab.
[09:12:14] <tj_vantoll> Yeah exactly.
[09:13:20] <tj_vantoll> We do the decode for a Safari 5.1 but, correct?
[09:14:32] <tj_vantoll> *bug* that is.
[09:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> So just try/catch and on error use the non-decoded value.
[09:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> That might work.
[09:15:11] <tj_vantoll> I like that.
[09:15:18] <jzaefferer> Seems fine
[09:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it will actually fix his problem, but it'll stop throwing an error, which is what he wants apparently.
[09:15:47] <rxaviers> hey guys, my irc client was closed and I missed it.
[09:15:56] <tj_vantoll> That's the best we can do.
[09:16:16] <tj_vantoll> I seem to recall the encoding needing to happen in some older version of IE too. There's a related bug that the Safari 5.1 fix also resolved.
[09:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8896
[09:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> IE 8/9
[09:17:23] <tj_vantoll> So we'll be stuck with this fun indefinitely :)
[09:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[09:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> This is a method that should be so simple, but has so many workarounds.
[09:19:26] <tj_vantoll> It'll be extensible soon :P
[09:19:47] <arschmitz> thats really the best we can do is make it extensible
[09:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's already extensible, just not released yet.
[09:21:29] <jzaefferer> dialog?
[09:21:43] <arschmitz> yeah we have the unreleased version in mobile :) took unreleased core and factory so figured might as well take tabs too
[09:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> I've got 2 things (I think just 2) to look at for dialog.
[09:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> The failing IE tests from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e263ebda99f3d414bae91a4a47e74a37ff93ba9c#commitcomment-4234183
[09:22:10] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: JoÌˆrn Zaefferer (1mon 2w ago): Dialog: Switch back to shuffling z-index, but only look at .ui-front siblings.  Fixes #9166 - Dialog: moveToTop implementation resets flash/video/iframe/scroll Fixes #9364 - Dialog: Click of element with tooltip scrolls the dialog to the top
[09:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> And the inheritance issue: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9241
[09:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What's the status of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1108?
[09:23:13] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1108 by jzaefferer (4w 5h ago): Dialog: Restore focus to the previously focused element when window regains focus
[09:23:53] <jzaefferer> still stuck at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1108#issuecomment-26529523
[09:23:53] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #1108 by jzaefferer (4w 5h ago): Dialog: Restore focus to the previously focused element when window regains focus
[09:24:17] <jzaefferer> "I'll give this another try another day." hasn't happened so far, though
[09:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've still got that comment in my inbox.
[09:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> Kinda far down at this point :-P
[09:25:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: would you be available tomorrow or Friday to go through these dialog issues together?
[09:26:01] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to get through the backlog in my inbox.
[09:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a tech check tomorrow at 12:30 ET for the JS Summit.
[09:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> But other than that, I should be available.
[09:26:40] <jzaefferer> I haven't really made any progress on my backlog since coming back from Amsterdam
[09:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> I've been making progress on mine :-)
[09:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers has also been piling more on though :-/
[09:27:31] * kborchers hides
[09:27:35] * rxaviers has no updates for this week. He'll brb. Please, just let me know if you have any question for me and I will reply later.
[09:27:46] <kborchers> i have a PR or 2 that need review too when someone gets a chance
[09:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> Anything to discuss about scoped themes?
[09:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> The classes option will solve this.
[09:30:15] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez arschmitz: I'd like to go through the Amsterdam minutes and create follow-up tickets - would be good to get your input on what actually needs to be tracked, and where.
[09:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:30:35] <arschmitz> sure
[09:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that after the dev leads meeting.
[09:30:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I think the specific dialog issue can be ignored until we have the classes option or something else - its not worth adressing that in Themeroller now
[09:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> On to selectmenu...
[09:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/menu-item-styling/demos/menu/default.html
[09:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/menu-style/demos/menu/icons.html
[09:31:59] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have consensus on the menu-style branch now?
[09:32:08] <fnagel1> I assume we should remove the first one as its based on some misunderstandings ;-)
[09:32:35] <jzaefferer> I've updated the menu-style branch once, to add cursor: pointer and some multi-line menu items
[09:32:56] <jzaefferer> I'd say multi-line items are easy enough to keep apart from other items
[09:33:21] <jzaefferer> also looks better for autocomplete, e.g. http://view.jqueryui.com/menu-style/demos/autocomplete/default.html
[09:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think it looks good.
[09:33:41] <jzaefferer> this needs an update though: http://view.jqueryui.com/menu-style/demos/autocomplete/categories.html
[09:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on my comment about using ui-state-hover instead of ui-state-active for parent items that have an open submenu?
[09:33:43] <fnagel1> Do we have a demo for multiline in Menu?
[09:33:56] <jzaefferer> the headers shouldn't be selectable
[09:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel1: http://view.jqueryui.com/menu-style/demos/menu/icons.html
[09:34:20] <jzaefferer> fnagel1: I've updated that default demo
[09:34:33] <jzaefferer> err
[09:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, that's unrelated to the styling though.
[09:34:36] <jzaefferer> right, the icons demo
[09:34:41] <fnagel1> ahh nice
[09:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> The headers problem is from the removeal of anchors.
[09:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...no selectmenu demo with optgroups?
[09:37:00] <tj_vantoll> Seems like it should.
[09:37:02] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: sure
[09:37:05] <fnagel1> iun default demo
[09:37:07] <fnagel1> in
[09:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, the second one. I see it now.
[09:37:53] <jzaefferer> disabled options here have bad styling, though that might go away with the new menu style: http://view.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/tests/visual/selectmenu/selectmenu.html
[09:38:30] <jzaefferer> happens when using cursor keys to move focus inside the menu, pixel shifting when going in and out of disabled items
[09:39:12] <fnagel1> jzaefferer: teh flickering is due to the latest menu changes, but the "Bad style" was there for a year or something
[09:39:33] <jzaefferer> Let's land menu-style in master, fix the autocomplete categories, merge to selectmenu and test there?
[09:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel1: How does selectemenu prevent menu from treating the optgroup headers as menu items?
[09:39:40] <fnagel1> jzaefferer: flickering is because of the margin -1 workaround
[09:39:55] <fnagel1> jzaefferer: agree
[09:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Sounds good.
[09:40:11] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: its using the menu default
[09:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...ok, I'll have to see what it's doing differently than the autocomplete demo.
[09:41:57] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: I guess its because of another change in Menu, I could send you the commit loink
[09:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:42:39] <jzaefferer> rebased the menu-style branch, now has three commits: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/menu-style
[09:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You should probably just squash the first two together.
[09:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind.
[09:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> The regression is from the anchor removal.
[09:43:25] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, go ahead and merge that in.
[09:43:38] <jzaefferer> obivously kborchers' fault :p
[09:43:41] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the autocomplete demo is his fault too :-P
[09:44:00] * kborchers is still hiding
[09:44:59] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: anchor removal and evantually using ui-menu-divider as new CSS class
[09:45:00] <kborchers> let me get the links to the good to merge comments on the anchor removal PR :P
[09:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> Don't fall to peer pressure, kborchers.
[09:45:46] <kborchers> lol
[09:46:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers: fixing the categories demo is interesting. Autocomplete doesn't expose the options it sets on menu, so setting { items: "> :not(.ui-autocomplete-category.)" } isn't possible
[09:46:46] <jzaefferer> I guess we can extend _create and change the items menu option after it got initialized
[09:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, we can just work around it if we need to.
[09:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> Or if just using the ui-menu-divider class works, we can do that too.
[09:49:45] <jzaefferer> It doesn't, but updating the menu option after init works
[09:49:56] <jzaefferer> the menu is empty at first anyway
[09:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Anything to discuss about datepicker?
[09:50:19] <fnagel1> I've got one more thing regarding selectmenu: I've played around to make using the native select menu possible, see: http://view.jqueryui.com/selectmenu-native-menu/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[09:50:51] <fnagel1> lots of issues, some of them seems really tricky because of technical limitations
[09:51:41] <tj_vantoll> I have the test suite running now. Most of the existing tests were commented out or removed, but 59 tests are up and running.
[09:53:38] <tj_vantoll> Nothing to discuss though.
[09:53:56] <tj_vantoll> I'm going to try to add in some tests for already implemented stuff now that the suite runs.
[09:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:55:18] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: see my comment above tj's
[09:55:32] <jzaefferer> the code changes for that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/selectmenu...selectmenu-native-menu
[09:56:55] <fnagel1> It seems the origin problem is that the interaction with the native select is somewhat "sandboxed" so we have some serious a11y and cakkback event issue
[09:56:58] <fnagel1> issues
[09:57:25] <fnagel1> similiar to the implementation of Mobile -- I'm not sure if its possible to solve these
[09:57:56] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, to the best of my knowledge they are impossible.
[09:58:48] <fnagel1> some of the main issues: no button text update when navigation closed selectmenu in native mode
[09:58:49] <arschmitz> fnagel1: yeah native selects have some weird event issues
[09:59:23] <fnagel1> no focus and select, delayed close event when using native select mode
[10:00:18] <fnagel1> Best I could think of is an extension which enables native menu but disables a lot of a11y and events. very unattractive solution.
[10:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well dev leads meeting is about to start.
[10:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> Let's continue any discussions in -dev.
[10:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
