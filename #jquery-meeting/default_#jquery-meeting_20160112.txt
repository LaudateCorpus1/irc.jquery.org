[14:04:07] <sfrisk>  
[14:04:16] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:05:13] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit ?
[14:05:50] <sfrisk> apparently he's only in #css-chassis right now
[14:08:36] <kristyjy> hmm
[14:09:00] <sfrisk> Rightooo then
[14:09:08] <sfrisk> talk about style guide stuff then?
[14:09:48] <sfrisk> kristyjy
[14:09:48] <kristyjy> lol sure
[14:10:07] <geekman-rohit> heya
[14:10:10] <geekman-rohit> been long
[14:10:19] <sfrisk> So we had discussed about coming up with a list of stuff that was going to be in the css style guide
[14:10:23] <sfrisk> instead of the scss styleguide
[14:10:26] <sfrisk> hey geekman-rohit
[14:10:37] <kristyjy> I must apologize for my lack of work I've gotten done on it. My vacation which I had planned to get everything done during ended up being much more busy than I had planned for
[14:10:49] <sfrisk> It happens
[14:10:57] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy happened with me too
[14:11:07] <kristyjy> I'm glad it's not just me lol
[14:11:11] <sfrisk> I figured we could use part of the meeting to come up with a list of the stuff we want to put in the CSS style guide so we can create an issue for that
[14:11:33] <geekman-rohit> and I think we should close some more PRs we did not get any responses on
[14:11:39] <geekman-rohit> so someone else can get them done
[14:11:40] <sfrisk> already did :-)
[14:11:51] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pulls
[14:11:57] <kristyjy> but yeah I really will nail down some time to get it done. I'm going to try to at least get an hour or so in this week. Problem is I'm job searching again so that's eating up a lot of time
[14:12:16] <geekman-rohit> I'll take that up
[14:12:17] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/134
[14:12:25] <geekman-rohit> Its small
[14:12:27] <sfrisk> Sounds good
[14:12:35] <geekman-rohit> I should be able to do a PR this week on that
[14:12:43] <kristyjy> so hopefully I can at least have news to report next week :)
[14:12:54] <sfrisk> also geekman-rohit - agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:13:33] <sfrisk> I ended up having to write a talk this week, so I didn't manage to get what I wanted done on buttons
[14:13:41] <sfrisk> I did add the indentation stuff to JSCS lcoally
[14:13:58] <sfrisk> and got this fun mess of validation issues: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/137#issuecomment-171015619
[14:14:26] <sfrisk> which I looked at some of these examples, and I don't think I agree with what their validation was saying
[14:14:51] <sfrisk> so I might go with arschmitz saying "this is annoying and lots of edge cases"
[14:15:10] <sfrisk> and just pull it in as is, without any indentation validation
[14:15:18] <sfrisk> if that works for people
[14:16:30] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:16:53] <geekman-rohit> umm also we should have some sort of guideline for design?
[14:17:07] <sfrisk> probably
[14:17:12] <geekman-rohit> so everything looks in sync
[14:17:32] <sfrisk> I was hoping if I hammered out buttons I could get some consistency in them
[14:17:54] <sfrisk> Sometimes I wish I was a designer :-(
[14:17:55] <geekman-rohit> im hoping i get 6 hours straight for chassis some day
[14:18:13] <geekman-rohit> and I wish I was a jedi :(
[14:19:16] <kristyjy> lol I wish I was a designer jedi
[14:19:24] <sfrisk> Jedi puts a big target on your back
[14:19:32] <sfrisk> Order 66 and all that
[14:19:37] <kristyjy> hehe true and you're not allowed to love
[14:20:01] <kristyjy> annnyyyway yeah I wish do actually wish I was a designer
[14:20:09] <sfrisk> and believe in absolutes while at the same time claiming only sith deal in absolutes
[14:20:23] <geekman-rohit> okay I take that back
[14:20:25] <geekman-rohit> :D
[14:20:54] <geekman-rohit> I'd rather be a namer then
[14:20:54] <sfrisk> but yeah - I think doing the variables will be easy in jsass
[14:21:12] <sfrisk> let me do the buttons stuff - and hopefully that will give us a baseline for some of our design ideas
[14:21:18] <kristyjy> do we know any designers who would be willing to contribute to help us?
[14:21:20] <sfrisk> when it comes to colors, states, etc
[14:21:28] <geekman-rohit> issacdurazo?
[14:21:32] <sfrisk> maybe?
[14:21:34] <geekman-rohit> maybe he could be of helo
[14:21:36] <sfrisk> I don't know how busy he is
[14:23:23] <sfrisk> have you guys checked out https://app.frontify.com before?
[14:24:20] <sfrisk> Could be useful for defining some of our styles in a visual way
[14:25:32] <geekman-rohit> since we never had that hack weekend
[14:25:41] <geekman-rohit> once sarahs Pr is in
[14:25:46] <geekman-rohit> we could have a design party
[14:25:56] <geekman-rohit> and come up with a design document or something?
[14:26:03] <sfrisk> I'll see if I can get the designer here to help me with a pass on it
[14:26:08] <sfrisk> and get her eye on the buttons
[14:29:09] <kristyjy_> sorry stupid thing kicked me out
[14:30:41] <sfrisk> okay, well don't think we can discuss much more until that buttons PR is done
[14:30:47] <sfrisk> *note to sarah - get your butt in gear*
[14:31:25] <sfrisk> I'll try to make sure I'm available through this week (although this weekend I won't be online much), so feel free to ping me about assignement
[14:31:26] <sfrisk> s
[14:31:44] <kristyjy_> sounds good have a good week everyone
[14:31:54] <sfrisk> Current Todo Lists for the week:
[14:32:07] <sfrisk> sfrisk - pull in jscs, accessibility, and finish buttons pr
[14:32:15] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit - add jsass vars to typography
[14:32:24] <sfrisk> kristyjy - scss style guide
[14:33:18] <sfrisk> and on that note, see you all in #css-chassis
