[12:00:58] <fnagel> hi
[12:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> hey fnagel
[12:02:34] <fnagel> hey
[12:02:38] <fnagel> no one else today?
[12:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's just us.
[12:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer is the only other person that's even in the channel, and he's idle.
[12:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> Well, do you have anything to discuss for datepicker?
[12:05:14] <fnagel> not really, have you seen my comment?
[12:05:41] <fnagel> this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1660#issuecomment-178108603
[12:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I saw that :-)
[12:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm glad Jon's becoming active.
[12:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to get involved with the WG, but I was way too busy.
[12:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> And the meetings conflicted for me.
[12:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> So it's good to see him helping out.
[12:06:52] <fnagel> yeah, we should definitly try to keep him in the loop for other widgets!
[12:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know if it was intentional that the selectmenu icon moved to the left? http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[12:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> I assume this was a mistake during the CSS changes for button.
[12:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't tracked down when this broke, but it was after 1.11.4.
[12:07:59] <fnagel> No, thats seems unintended
[12:08:17] <fnagel> At least no change I'm aware of and it looks jst wrong
[12:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:09:09] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Check the icon: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[12:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> Probably broke during the button CSS change.
[12:09:16] <arschmitz> looking
[12:09:38] <scott_gonzalez> Should be on the right side, like http://view.jqueryui.com/1.11.4/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[12:09:57] <arschmitz> yeah that should be easy fix
[12:10:26] <arschmitz> we dont position the icon any more
[12:10:28] <arschmitz> its inline
[12:10:36] <arschmitz> so we need to make it append instead of prepend
[12:11:24] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/selectmenu.js#L122
[12:11:43] <arschmitz> ill take care of it
[12:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> cool, thansk
[12:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> There were two issues filed recently that we should discuss.
[12:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> Though I doubt we'll get a decision on either right now.
[12:13:36] <arschmitz> ok
[12:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> First, should you be able to change containment-based options in draggable during a drag?
[12:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14912
[12:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really opposed to it, though I have no desire to fix this prior to the rewrite.
[12:14:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:14:39] <arschmitz> i agree seems fine if there is nothing to crazy involved
[12:14:43] <arschmitz> but not until re-write
[12:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:19:23] <arschmitz> but id be genericly opposed to most changes prior to re-write
[12:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> The other ticket is about sortables that are stacked on top of each other with z-index: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14913
[12:20:11] <arschmitz> yuck
[12:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> This one seems trickier, and honestly without digging into the actual implementation, I don't even want to comment on it.
[12:22:37] <arschmitz> so i guess my main comment
[12:22:58] <arschmitz> is that i would have the top one catch it and based on his own logic
[12:23:03] <arschmitz> append it to the lower one
[12:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, he doesn't want it in the lower one.
[12:24:02] <arschmitz> maybe i read wrong
[12:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> Right now, the receive event is triggered on both sortables.
[12:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're not nested.
[12:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> They're just visually stacked.
[12:25:05] <arschmitz> ok i see and when you drop on the top one both are getting the event
[12:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:25:38] <arschmitz> i can only assume its because the event is coord based
[12:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> I think it is. I'm pretty sure it looks up bounding boxes on start and caches them.
[12:27:02] <arschmitz> so seems like a bug but i wouldnt want to even try to fix it before re write
[12:27:05] <arschmitz> seems to complicated
[12:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> And droppable/sortable only handle nesting, not overlapping.
[12:27:16] <arschmitz> right
[12:27:33] <arschmitz> and im not sure how simple this will be to fix either
[12:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's probably not super straight-forward.
[12:28:08] <arschmitz> well you will need to know where the possible targets all are at the start of darg
[12:28:23] <arschmitz> so maintain a hash of every possible target as they are initalized
[12:28:31] <arschmitz> and get all their positions
[12:28:44] <arschmitz> or completely change how sortable and droppable work
[12:29:05] <arschmitz> either way is major
[12:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so both are just on hold.
[12:30:01] <arschmitz> yup
[12:30:15] <arschmitz> first as long as its not crazy should be possible
[12:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> Did either of you have anything else to discuss today?
[12:30:26] <arschmitz> and second seems like a bug if we can sanely fix it
[12:30:29] <arschmitz> no
[12:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, I guess that's it for today.
[12:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. See you back in -dev.
