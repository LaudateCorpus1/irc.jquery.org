[09:02:06] <rworth> hey
[09:02:19] <jzaefferer> Starting another UI meeting, hooray
[09:02:20] <bot-t> (11 hours 10 mins ago) <kborchers> tell jzaefferer how/when are browsers added to swarm? Opera 11.6 needs to be added. I'm seeing weird failures with datepicker
[09:02:25] <jzaefferer> thanks kborchers
[09:03:13] <jzaefferer> danheberden: wanna give us the awesomest infrastructure update?
[09:04:16] <danheberden> jzaefferer allocating servers like a boss
[09:04:25] <jzaefferer> like a jboss?
[09:04:33] <jzaefferer> oh wait, that's kborchers
[09:04:33] <danheberden> heh
[09:04:49] <kborchers> jzaefferer: :D
[09:05:10] <danheberden> cleaning house with all our old boxes, getting the puppet on the new ones with staging servers
[09:05:18] <danheberden> puppet is up and running and working
[09:05:27] <rworth> yay
[09:05:38] <jzaefferer> okay, sounds like in another week we can put up some actual staging servers and stuff?
[09:06:06] <danheberden> the servers will be put up - there's more the setting up puppet to run them properly, stage them properly, etc
[09:06:37] <jzaefferer> is gnarf involved in that as well?
[09:06:49] <danheberden> he's been busy thus far, but i'm sure he'll be lending his magic fingers soon
[09:07:34] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:07:38] <danheberden> but as it stands now, there is a dummy server to play around with puppet configs, staging servers of each of the main servers that run off of the staging branch in github
[09:07:47] <danheberden> so pretty good so far on that end
[09:09:04] <jzaefferer> for the 1.9 release, will want to keep the UI site as is, but set up the new API subsite
[09:09:17] <jzaefferer> so getting a staging server for that in place asap would be very helpful
[09:09:56] <jzaefferer> rworth can tell you more about it
[09:10:12] <jzaefferer> I want to invite people to help us write docs, once things land in the repo they should be visible somewhere is intended for the end-result
[09:10:56] <danheberden> jzaefferer that meshes well either way, cuz that's all going to be wordpress ya?
[09:11:25] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:11:29] <danheberden> and since it's based on git, the content will be easy to sync on both the main and stage servers
[09:11:32] <rworth> I think there's a chance the site fully relaunches before 1.9
[09:11:40] <rworth> but whatevs, we'll need to make whatever work
[09:11:46] <jzaefferer> I guess we'll actually have to update the site to kick out all the API docs
[09:11:57] <jzaefferer> but just deleting things should be easy enough
[09:11:59] <rworth> might mean old download builder and old themeroller on new site, worst case, for example
[09:12:23] <danheberden> hmm, that might be an issue
[09:12:51] <danheberden> if the main ui site is wordpress, but /themeroller isn't
[09:12:58] <danheberden> and is compiling zips on the same box
[09:13:03] <rworth> it can be themeroller.jqueryui.com
[09:13:06] <rworth> and download.jqueryui.com
[09:13:18] <rworth> ie, different boxes
[09:13:26] <gnarf> got a bit of a reprise from my server FUBAR right now ( burning linux images ) :)
[09:13:27] <danheberden> a preemtive answer to my question!
[09:13:32] <rworth> :D
[09:15:18] <jzaefferer> gnarf, you're still on the effects unit tests?
[09:15:57] <gnarf> i did some testing by hand, can't reproduce, gotta dig into the swarm envrionment
[09:16:21] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:16:41] <jzaefferer> I've started working on a grunt zip task, that should be useful for the grunt-ui-build
[09:16:59] <jzaefferer> got some feedback from Ben for the API, that will help to make it reuseable
[09:17:28] <jzaefferer> rworth: did you look into that for UI?
[09:17:36] <jzaefferer> Otherwise I'll just put my name on the list there
[09:17:37] <rworth> jzaefferer: not yet, you're ahead of me
[09:17:42] <rworth> go ahead, thanks
[09:18:53] <jzaefferer> gnarf: from your work on the Makefile stuff, what should we focus on for migrating to grunt?
[09:19:24] <jzaefferer> concat, minify and zip seems to be under control
[09:19:35] <gnarf> tbh - it seems that the "make" targets are pretty straight forward, but the "push release" script is crazy complex
[09:19:41] <gnarf> there is probably something that can be done
[09:19:47] <gnarf> i didn't dive to far into it
[09:19:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did you ever test the output of the make branch (the zips?)
[09:20:11] <gnarf> also - most of it is pretty straight forward
[09:20:12] <jzaefferer> yeah, though push release doesn't really have to be cross-platform, right?
[09:20:23] <gnarf> dont think so
[09:21:06] <jzaefferer> kind of silly for us to have you work on make first, then move over to grunt, but still seems to make sense for the long run
[09:21:29] <gnarf> whatever - that make was like <8hr of work anyway
[09:21:45] <jzaefferer> with grunt we can abstract away the custom tasks as plugins, reusable for other projects or even to land upstream
[09:21:48] <gnarf> if it helps for the grunt migration at all to see it written as a make instead of build.xml then it helps
[09:22:14] <jzaefferer> as for the headers, we want to go for a unified header, listing all the concat targets
[09:22:22] <jzaefferer> did you look into that already?
[09:22:25] <jzaefferer> I guess not
[09:22:32] <jzaefferer> isn't in Ant
[09:24:09] <gnarf> nope, not yet
[09:24:39] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:25:14] <jzaefferer> will try and prototype that, then let someone more familiar with node tell me how to do it better
[09:25:23] <jzaefferer> As for Tooltip, that's pretty much done.
[09:25:43] <jzaefferer> I'm not expecting any major changes until 1.9 final, though we'll keep an eye on any feedback
[09:26:06] <jzaefferer> Still working on the collision notification API for Position, that may also affect tooltip
[09:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I could never get the make branch to finish a build
[09:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> It always hung at one point or another.
[09:26:44] <gnarf> :/
[09:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> I had some feedback written down, but then we got into grunt-mode...
[09:27:22] <jzaefferer> Then there's this on the agenda: 1.8.18 done, Updating to latest QUnit, data naming - I'll skip that unless someone has something to add...
[09:27:38] <jzaefferer> As for docs, rworth is working on a mediawiki2xml script
[09:27:54] <jzaefferer> not sure if thats the greatest idea, as the old docs aren't necessarily worth copying
[09:28:06] <rworth> they give us a really decent starting point
[09:28:09] <jzaefferer> Still might be good to fill out the boilerplate
[09:28:17] <rworth> if nothing more than listing out the options and methods and events
[09:28:22] <jzaefferer> especially for current interactions, which we don't want to documentation from scratch at this point anyway
[09:28:29] <rworth> just the names and types is a good help
[09:28:41] <rworth> descriptions leave a lot to be desired, so this is only a starting point
[09:28:48] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:28:53] <jzaefferer> how much time did you put into that?
[09:28:59] <rworth> 3hrs this am
[09:29:12] <jzaefferer> That's the total?
[09:29:15] <rworth> yeah
[09:29:21] <rworth> it's a few regex'es
[09:29:23] <jzaefferer> Okay, cool
[09:29:36] <jzaefferer> So next up is the WordPress integration, right?
[09:29:49] <rworth> yes
[09:30:00] <jzaefferer> I think for potential contributors, we should just go for previewing the xml file in the browser, then pushing to staging asap
[09:30:06] <jzaefferer> for the integrated view
[09:30:20] <jzaefferer> setting up WordPress network is still too much trouble...
[09:30:21] <rworth> we can do a local preview in the jquery-docs repo
[09:30:25] <rworth> with a simple grunt task
[09:30:26] <rworth> yeah
[09:30:50] <jzaefferer> you don't even need that, as the xslt is linked inside each xml file
[09:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, live preview for docs is gonna be really important.
[09:31:02] <jzaefferer> http://jquery.github.com/jquery-docs/jquery-ui/tooltip/tooltip.xml
[09:31:11] <jzaefferer> outputs html!
[09:31:35] <rworth> that's true, but browser dev tools don't allow you to inspect the transformed html *boo*
[09:31:44] <jzaefferer> That's also true
[09:31:49] <rworth> in a lot of cases, it will be sufficient
[09:32:03] <jzaefferer> Actually, latest Chrome shows me html
[09:32:18] <jzaefferer> Might be new in 17 :-)
[09:32:25] <rworth> but I'll write a 2min script to output the transformed html to disc, no reason no to share that with others
[09:32:33] <rworth> my memory could be of Firebug
[09:32:44] <jzaefferer> I think in 16 it didn't work
[09:32:46] <jzaefferer> Not sure though
[09:32:50] <rworth> cool
[09:32:52] <jzaefferer> right now there's an ant task for that
[09:32:59] <jzaefferer> might be useful as a reference
[09:33:10] <rworth> thanks
[09:33:56] <jzaefferer> So assuming we keep the old site, how do we integrate the new API?
[09:34:04] <jzaefferer> We can't get around to making site changes
[09:34:20] <jzaefferer> Which might get us close to the point where its less effort to go with the new site...
[09:34:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: Any thoughts on that?
[09:35:02] <rworth> the current sites uses html docs
[09:35:09] <rworth> the new docs are html after xslt
[09:35:13] <rworth> I don't see an issue
[09:35:40] <rworth> but the new site is ahead of the 1.9 release as it's part of the re-launch of all sites
[09:35:43] <jzaefferer> I mean, don't we want to move API docs to seperate subdomain and rip them out from the demo pages?
[09:36:00] <rworth> right, so that means having a completed redesign of jqueryui.com
[09:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> I think we'll get the new site out for 1.9
[09:36:28] <rworth> that's got to be done before the relaunch of all sites using web-base-template, but maybe not before download builder and themeroller are rewritten
[09:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not new DB + TR backends though.
[09:38:47] <jzaefferer> So new site, new API docs, old DB+TR
[09:38:58] <rworth> yeah
[09:39:12] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:39:15] <jzaefferer> gotta go
[09:39:23] <jzaefferer> we're through the agenda anyway
[09:39:43] <rworth> thanks all
