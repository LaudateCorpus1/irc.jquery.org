[11:01:39] <toddparker> Hi all - the jQuery Mobile meeting is getting started
[11:02:24] <toddparker> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xiJPR3oGU4uhqkWpvGXHNtAwmVPBpSvA4-ZRhRh7k6Q/edit?pli=1
[11:03:34] <gseguin> You can join the google hangout at https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/5a69651d14ada55ccb7e5dc15809dce43ac50741
[11:09:16] <toddparker> download builder
[11:09:59] <toddparker> in good shape, but need to look at how to package just structure css
[11:10:25] <toddparker> no open issues but we need do more testing internally
[11:15:23] <toddparker> next
[11:15:28] <toddparker> Themeroller
[11:20:07] <toddparker> open the ability of 3rd party tools to hook in to TR
[11:20:18] <toddparker> Current idea: Support a lightweight round trip theme solution that lets a 3rd party tool have a button that would launch TR in a new window/iframe. This could either be a default TR theme (Create new theme) or it could support editing by pushing in a theme (via the import mechanism) so the theme would appear in TR, ready for modification. In TR, allow the Download button to be customized in appearance (Save to App X
[11:20:19] <toddparker> icon) and the 3rd party tool would write a handler to manage the manipulation and saving of the TR output on their side. We'd just provide the hooks in and out so this would be a new API for developers to use TR without forking it and making a custom build.
[11:23:05] <toddparker> early days
[11:23:13] <toddparker> but this could be cool
[11:24:28] <toddparker> 1.1.1 Planning  ////////////////////////////////////////////////
[11:24:29] <toddparker> Open issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=14&state=open
[11:27:06] <toddparker> Pull requests
[11:27:07] <toddparker> Lots of recent activity so we need to carve out more time for review (Ghislain & Bender)
[11:27:07] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulls
[11:37:18] <toddparker> PhoneGap blinky transitions
[11:37:19] <toddparker> Scott's recent fix for blinking in PhoneGap seems to be pretty solid, though I've see a few reports that some issues remain. Since PG is a big deal, we should probably accelerate 1.1.1 for release in the next 2-3 weeks.
[11:37:35] <toddparker> Fixed jumping into place on transition w/scroll
[11:37:36] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3984
[11:37:37] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3984 on jquery-mobile (webdpro; 3w, 4d ago): jumping fixed header IOS & Android RC2
[11:37:37] <toddparker> This fix seemed to help when I tested:
[11:37:38] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4225
[11:37:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eugenebond (5d, 23h ago): Issue 3984: jumping fixed header IOS & Android RC2
[11:41:01] <toddparker> Button/form consistency
[11:41:01] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4098#issuecomment-5469381
[11:41:02] <toddparker> test page: http://ugomobi.github.com/forms/
[11:41:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4098 on jquery-mobile (elfgoh; 2w, 1d ago): Buttons not centralised horizontally
[11:41:10] <toddparker> - might need to think about IE7
[11:44:55] <toddparker> 2.3 nav issues
[11:44:56] <toddparker> The back button doesn’t work in 2.x in some situations. The proposed fix is a revert back to the old timeout based prevention but doesn’t prevent the popstate triggered navigation like the previous version did.
[11:44:57] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3980
[11:44:57] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3980 on jquery-mobile (konrado; 3w, 5d ago): 1.1 RC2, Android, data-rel back doesn't work correctly in some cases
[11:45:55] <toddparker> we're going to land this today so we can test this for a few weeks to land it in the patch release
