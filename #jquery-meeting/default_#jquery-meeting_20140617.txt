[01:03:23] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[01:03:27] <Changsuk> Hi~
[01:03:30] <Hyunsook> Hi~
[01:03:34] <Kangsik> Hi.. :-)
[01:03:38] <Minkyeong> hi all
[01:04:37] <uGoMobi> hi
[01:05:25] <_|Nix|_> So, one topic for today is collapsible.
[01:05:28] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_, @uGoMobi : I have removed style options(corners, inset) from collapsible widget.
[01:05:33] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_, @uGoMobi : Please visit below site and, then tell me your opinions.
[01:05:41] <Kangsik> http://allsteady.github.io/demo_widget/collapsible/demo.html
[01:05:48] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: awesome, thanks!
[01:06:28] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[01:06:28] <Kangsik> uGoMobi: NP :-)
[01:06:52] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: How's the interaction with collapsibleset?
[01:07:29] <Kangsik> I only use css.
[01:09:08] <_|Nix|_> For example, if the collapsibleset is inset, the collapsible must not have corners.
[01:09:14] <uGoMobi> Kangsik: did you have to make changes in the CSS or only use the negate-classes?
[01:10:21] <Kangsik> I add new negate-classes. ".ui-collapsible-set > .ui-corner-all-force.ui-collapsible.ui-first-child"
[01:11:57] <_|Nix|_> Why do you need ui-corner-all-force?
[01:14:17] <_|Nix|_> I ask, because we should use as few new class names as possible. Right, uGoMobi?
[01:14:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, and if possible only generic ones (not widget specific)
[01:15:35] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Yes, right. Kangsik already knew that.
[01:15:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: however, we have this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7242
[01:17:05] <Kangsik> in case, after a user uses inset option in a collapsible set, he/she want to use inset option in the child collapble.
[01:17:06] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi:  I think Kangsik will explain a reason for using ui-corner-all-force, right?
[01:17:28] <Kangsik> I think, we can/should  ui-corner-all-force.
[01:19:15] <_|Nix|_> Alright. I guess the PR will make it clear.
[01:19:31] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: yes, right. I agreed with you. but I had to add a new class to ignore a inheritance.
[01:19:46] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see ...
[01:20:02] <uGoMobi> yeah, I can imagine we need a class for that
[01:20:22] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Yes, I will do a PR.
[01:20:32] <uGoMobi> perfect
[01:20:41] <uGoMobi> makes it easier to see the diff
[01:21:01] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: But, I told you before i do a PR to clear.
[01:21:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think about arschmitz's idea to re-implement collapsible/-set using accordion? Now that we've achieved option deprecation for collapsible, I'm thinking we should first go through all widgets and only then, if we have time left, should we look into accordion.
[01:22:50] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik, Hyunsook, Minkyeong, Changsuk: arschmitz mentioned that we might want to re-implement collapsible&-set via UI's accordion widget: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1447
[01:23:31] <_|Nix|_> However, I'm thinking it might be better to break this into two tasks: One, to deprecate the style options, and two, to implement collapsible and collapsibleset via accordion - only if time permits.
[01:24:33] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: ah~
[01:24:38] <Kangsik> @_|Nix|_: I agree with your words.
[01:24:41] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: +1
[01:25:05] <_|Nix|_> The ultimate goal, nevertheless, is to move away from collapsible and towards accordion. However, we need not do that for 1.5.0.
[01:25:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was just looking at accordion
[01:25:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: +1
[01:26:03] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[01:27:21] <Kangsik> So should I do a PR with my code?
[01:27:40] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Absolutely!
[01:28:18] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Please don't forget the demos and the API docs, either!
[01:28:48] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Yes. :-)
[01:29:15] <_|Nix|_> Excellent! We're making good progress!
[01:29:43] <uGoMobi> for sure
[01:29:46] <Hyunsook> ^^
[01:29:47] <uGoMobi> nice!
[01:30:48] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Do you think that you could write unit tests for some of this stuff? We now have tests/css wherein we can write css-related unit tests.
[01:32:07] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: I will check test cases.
[01:32:25] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: My concern is that, if we ultimately merge the style-option-deprecation branch, we may end up with merge conflicts, and when we resolve those, we may end up introducing bugs.
[01:33:15] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Ok...
[01:33:39] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: ... especially if the merge conflicts show up in the CSS files.
[01:33:39] <_|Nix|_> Sheesh! What is it with IRC today?
[01:35:19] <uGoMobi> yeah :/
[01:35:33] <uGoMobi> we have some combined collapsible+listview demos
[01:35:50] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: It'd be nice to have things like ok( $( "#my-collapsible" ).css( "border-top-radius" ) > 0, "collapsible has a border radius" );
[01:36:00] <uGoMobi> we might want to work on listview next
[01:36:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, especially since listview is the other inset-accepting widget, right?
[01:36:37] <uGoMobi> but we want to review that widget
[01:36:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[01:36:49] <Kangsik> what is that mean '( $( "#my-collapsible" ).css( "border-top-radius" ) > 0, "'?
[01:37:08] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: It's an assertion.
[01:37:26] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: I was giving a (probably incorrect) example of a unit test for a CSS rule.
[01:37:50] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Here's what we have for controlgroup right now:
[01:37:52] <_|Nix|_> deepEqual( $( "#footer-notext" ).height(), $( "#footer-text" ).height(), "Footer: Icon-only button has the same height as text-only button" );
[01:38:06] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Ok. I see. :)
[01:38:20] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Something similar but for corners would be useful.
[01:38:37] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: You can, for example, check to make sure that inheritance works correctly.
[01:39:12] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Ok. I will check it.
[01:40:33] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Unfortunately we have very, very few css tests. In fact, we currently only have two assertions. It would be really nice to test our structural CSS some more.
[01:42:31] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: It will be nice to test CSS some more?
[01:42:59] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Yeah. It would be nice to put more tests into tests/css to make sure that, when we make CSS changes, we don't break existing styling.
[01:43:35] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Ah. I see. :)
[01:45:04] * _|Nix|_ is thinking about other places where we might add CSS tests
[01:45:41] <Hyunsook> Kangsik, Minkyeong: I think we told _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi all topics. right?
[01:46:10] <Kangsik> Hyunsook: Yes. I told all things.
[01:46:28] <_|Nix|_> Excellent! Thanks a lot for all your work!
[01:46:40] <uGoMobi> great, thanks!
[01:47:06] <Hyunsook> Good!
[01:47:57] <_|Nix|_> Well then, we're all set for another productive week. Have a good one, and a good weekend, too!
[01:48:28] <Hyunsook> Have a good weekend~! ^^
[01:48:44] <Kangsik> Have a good day. :-)
[01:49:04] <uGoMobi> good luck against Russia at the World Cup :)
[01:49:20] <uGoMobi> see you next week
[01:51:13] <Changsuk> Have such a nice week and weekend~~ :)
[01:51:38] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: thanks for your words~~!
[01:52:21] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Thanks~! *^-^*
[01:52:22] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: I really want for Korea team to win the game~~! ;)
