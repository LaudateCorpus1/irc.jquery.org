[01:00:51] <uGoMobi> hey
[01:01:04] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk, Kangsik, uGoMobi ready for another eye-popping, edge-of-your-seat meeting?
[01:01:15] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook should be along shortly.
[01:01:18] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[01:01:45] <uGoMobi> sure :)
[01:02:34] <Minkyeong> hi all
[01:02:52] <Kangsik> Hi All :-)
[01:03:03] <_|Nix|_> Minkyeong: hey! Sorry I missed you in the roll call :)
[01:03:54] <Minkyeong> _|Nix|_: NP! :-)
[01:05:10] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Hey!
[01:05:14] <Hyunsook> Hi~ ^^
[01:05:18] <uGoMobi> hi all
[01:06:02] <uGoMobi> shall we do a very short update?
[01:06:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Quick question - do we have a TR branch for 1.5 changes?
[01:06:47] <Changsuk> Hi~~ All. I'm late~
[01:06:59] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: No, you're not. We were just getting started.
[01:07:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: haha... guess what I was checking right now ;)
[01:07:16] <_|Nix|_> No way ...
[01:07:19] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: ha~ Thanks for your kind word.~
[01:07:21] <uGoMobi> seriously
[01:07:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't
[01:07:41] <_|Nix|_> I just realized that one of our checkpoints is to update TR - but we shouldn't be doing that on master.
[01:08:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wanted to wait until we landed those fixes for the icon issues... will create a 1.5-update branch now
[01:08:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[01:08:24] <_|Nix|_> Oh, right, that's a good point.
[01:08:36] <_|Nix|_> OK, so we PR against 1.5-update. Cool!
[01:10:08] <uGoMobi> So we have 1.5 branches on all repos and a checklist in all tickets
[01:10:20] <uGoMobi> I think we don't have a ticket for collapsible (set) yet
[01:10:26] <_|Nix|_> In terms of news, I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm done with the library and API portion of the checkboxradio style option removal. Please have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7466 and https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/317 and comment if you find anything missing/incorrect.
[01:10:36] <uGoMobi> awesome
[01:10:49] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Yes, right.
[01:11:16] <_|Nix|_> I guess I'll take a look at the implications for TR next.
[01:12:15] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: After the task for checkboxradio complete, my team can create a ticket for collapsible, I think.
[01:12:24] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: ok
[01:13:05] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: The API and library portion is complete, pending review. Only the TR porition is missing.
[01:13:51] <uGoMobi> and I will right something for the upgrade guide for those two widgets
[01:13:53] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Right. I saw your commits. ^^
[01:13:58] <uGoMobi> s/right/write/
[01:14:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does the button require any TR changes? I'm thinking that corners and shadow are still gonna be there. Maybe the preview needs to remove data-corners="true" if it's present at all, but other than that I don't think we need to change any of the TR logic, right?
[01:14:53] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: I think my team can/will create a ticket and PR for collapsible before next meeting.
[01:15:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I think the preview markup is the only thing
[01:15:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, that's, like, almost nothing. Good!
[01:15:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure how the app work regarding setting border-radius
[01:15:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, there's still place for the specially-formatted comment, right, because the theme will still have a key for button-border-radius.
[01:16:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[01:16:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, there's still gonna be a control for specifying border radius ... I really can't think of anything to change other than the preview. Let's hope that's really all there is.
[01:17:10] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Awesome!
[01:17:25] <_|Nix|_> That'll be three widgets already.
[01:17:50] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: collapsible and collapsible set will be really tricky, I think, because of the complex inheritance relationship.
[01:18:25] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: OTOH, replacing the inheritance-implemented-via-JS with inheritance-implemented-via-CSS will be really, really beneficial.
[01:18:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if we updated all corner handling correctly for 1.4 I don't think we need to do anything now besides the markup
[01:18:46] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: Yes, right. So, the task isn't easy....
[01:18:49] <Kangsik> _|Nix|_: Yes right.. Collapsible  is very very difficult. :-(
[01:19:04] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik, Hyunsook: You can do it!
[01:19:06] <uGoMobi> great... we have a challange :-)
[01:19:31] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: ha.... ^^;
[01:19:37] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually kinda hoping it'll turn out to be easy, because what I've done in JS is really something that should've been done in CSS.
[01:19:56] <_|Nix|_> But anyway, I'll stop speculating.
[01:20:59] <uGoMobi> I don't have anything else
[01:21:03] <Changsuk> Kangsik, Hyunsook: so... Can we modify Collapsible widget?
[01:21:23] <Changsuk> Kangsik, Hyunsook: How long does it take?
[01:22:08] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi, Changsuk: Yes. My team is modifyng collapsible.
[01:22:32] <_|Nix|_> OK, it's official then :)
[01:23:05] <_|Nix|_> Alright, I'm also outta topics.
[01:23:10] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi, Changsuk: ... but, I think we need to discuss the PR after we submit a PR for collapsible.
[01:23:18] <Changsuk> Hyunsook: ah~ I'm sorry that I didn't know that.
[01:23:27] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Yeah, for sure!
[01:23:30] <Hyunsook> Changsuk: NP. ^^
[01:23:32] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: sure
[01:23:52] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually looking forward to seeing the solution!
[01:24:16] <_|Nix|_> Implementing that inheritance has been quite a braintwister. I'd rather see it done correctly :)
[01:24:58] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Thanks~
[01:25:37] <uGoMobi> thanks for working on that!
[01:26:44] <_|Nix|_> OK. This is really good progress. Do we need to discuss any other topics before next week?
[01:27:40] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: No. I and my tema told you all topic.
[01:27:52] <Hyunsook> team*
[01:27:56] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook: Thanks!
[01:28:22] <_|Nix|_> In that case, let's all have a good, productive week, followed by a relaxing weekend! See y'all next week!
[01:28:22] <Hyunsook> ^^
[01:28:25] <uGoMobi> perfect
[01:28:27] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
