[12:01:19] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:28] <bethge> hi
[12:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> hi
[12:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> I've been super busy this week and haven't even looked at what's been going on.
[12:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> I do have a bunch of PEP emails in my inbox though.
[12:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm guessing there has been a fair amount of activity :-)
[12:03:19] <bethge> :-D
[12:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to give a run down of what's going on?
[12:06:07] <bethge> Sure, I'll try my best: steditor updated his PR (https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/267)
[12:06:34] <bethge> It now covers the mousemove situation for chorded mouse button presses on FF 44
[12:06:41] <bethge> (on linux)
[12:07:26] <bethge> Since on FF44 ubuntu was this issue of mouseevent.buttons behaving differently than on the other browsers
[12:08:12] <bethge> There still is some more work for handling touch events though
[12:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:08:57] <bethge> arschmitz added PEP to the gsoc proposal list https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2016-Ideas-List
[12:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> So, that PR is good to land at this poing?
[12:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll add another one for touch events?
[12:09:48] <bethge> Yeah it looks good to me, and a new issue sounds good
[12:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, do you want to handle the merge?
[12:12:47] <bethge> uuh, sure, thanks :)
[12:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> Just needs to have references added to the commit message.
[12:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> If you have any questions about doing that, just ping me in #pep.
[12:13:16] <bethge> ok, will do
[12:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/272 looks good to me.
[12:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need more than just a minute to review https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/271 though ;-)
[12:16:09] <bethge> ofc :D
[12:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> Does that cover everything?
[12:17:11] <bethge> I believe so
[12:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks!
[14:02:57] <arschmitz> apsdehal_: agcolom: sfrisk: cgack: cogwurx: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: meeting time

[14:08:04] <arschmitz> ok so lets start with panel
[14:08:09] <arschmitz> looks like its ready to merge
[14:08:30] <apsdehal_> Just finished addressing the comments
[14:08:37] <arschmitz> apsdehal_: i saw thank you
[14:08:50] <apsdehal_> ::)
[14:08:53] <arschmitz> apsdehal_: did you look at the issue with the header jasperdegroot mentioned last time or is that still a todo
[14:09:13] <apsdehal_> I had a look at it, but didn't get time to work on it, will try tonight.
[14:09:23] <arschmitz> sounds good
[14:09:26] <arschmitz> that can land seperate
[14:09:44] <arschmitz> i finished reviewing the selectmenu pr from gabrielschulhof
[14:09:53] <arschmitz> overall looks good and very close just some small things
[14:10:19] <gabrielschulhof> Thanks!
[14:10:21] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: anything else outsstanding there we should know about/
[14:10:30] <arschmitz> or that needs dscussion
[14:10:47] <gabrielschulhof> Just the tests. I need to excise the deprecated stuff and write tests for it specifically.
[14:10:53] <gabrielschulhof> Didn't have time this week :(
[14:11:12] <gabrielschulhof> ... but I'll try to squeeze it into next week, along with your review comments.
[14:11:21] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:11:45] <arschmitz> cgack: saw it looked like you pushed right before meeting?
[14:12:17] <cgack> just messing with tests. added a skip to see what happened....
[14:12:25] <arschmitz> ok
[14:12:41] <cgack> more failures in 2.1.1
[14:12:45] <arschmitz> ok
[14:12:58] <arschmitz> if you need help there let me know and i can try to figure it out with you
[14:13:04] <cgack> I would love some help
[14:13:19] <cgack> i pushed my branch upstream last week to jquery-mobile
[14:13:58] <cgack> I also have been trying to figure out what was deprecated, but with all the changes to table I'd appreciate some help there too
[14:14:39] <cgack> here's the branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/8341-table-classes-option
[14:14:47] <arschmitz> sure
[14:14:58] <arschmitz> ill take a look in next couple days
[14:15:06] <arschmitz> and see what i can figure out for the tests
[14:15:18] <arschmitz> and review for deprecated code
[14:15:32] <cgack> thanks!
[14:15:36] <arschmitz> @gabrielschulhof  can you review for table specific deprecated stuff
[14:15:43] <arschmitz> you probably remember that better then i do
[14:16:10] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:17:01] <cgack> I saw some css that is deprecated for the table-stripe/stroke do we have a backcompat css or is that just something we add to the docs
[14:17:31] <arschmitz> thats kinda jasperdegroot area what are your thoughts?
[14:17:52] <jasperdegroot> I think we can just remove
[14:17:57] <jasperdegroot> and maybe make a demo
[14:18:01] <cgack> wait... nvm. that was deprecated in 1.4 so yeah... its gone
[14:18:08] <jasperdegroot> to show how you can do it yourself
[14:18:12] <arschmitz> ok great!
[14:18:17] <cgack> I think its already in demos
[14:18:36] <jasperdegroot> yeah you're probably right
[14:19:11] <jasperdegroot> but not sure if that demo included the styles or just the classes (since the styles were in the theme CSS)
[14:19:56] <arschmitz> cgack: can you double check that and add if not
[14:19:57] <cgack> jasperdegroot: it has it -> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/table-reflow-stripes-strokes/
[14:20:33] <jasperdegroot> oh great
[14:21:05] <arschmitz> ok great
[14:21:10] <arschmitz> so next
[14:21:10] <jasperdegroot> and it has been removed from the theme CSS, right?
[14:21:11] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6531
[14:21:26] <arschmitz> Google Summer of Code
[14:21:36] <arschmitz> we are planning on participating again
[14:21:56] <arschmitz> and i was wondering if any one was willing to be a mentor or had ideas for projects
[14:22:07] <jasperdegroot> hmm it was not removed yet (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css#L42)
[14:22:13] <arschmitz> this is a great opportunity for the project
[14:22:35] <arschmitz> not only will get get full time paid developer(s) for the summer but hopefully new long term contributors
[14:22:47] <cgack> jasperdegroot: I'll add it as a TODO for my table pr
[14:22:48] <arschmitz> the is how apsdehal_ came to us and chassis got a new contributor last year as well
[14:22:59] <jasperdegroot> cgack: I just reopened the ticket
[14:23:14] <cgack> jasperdegroot: thanks
[14:23:17] <jasperdegroot> cgack: but great if you can remove it in your PR
[14:25:19] <arschmitz> if anyone is interested in helping as a mentor let me know by tomorrow morning please
[14:25:23] <arschmitz> we have to submit then
[14:25:33] <apsdehal_> arschmitz: I tried replicating the issue 6767 on android 2.3 with the latest jqm (1.5) and it seems to be fixed.
[14:25:51] <arschmitz> apsdehal_: we dont support 2.3 any more anyway so sound good
[14:25:55] <arschmitz> close it if you cant reproduce
[14:25:56] <apsdehal_> Only issue left is that of out of view ui-content
[14:26:24] <jasperdegroot> this can't be fixed if you ask me
[14:26:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:26:47] <apsdehal_> Why?
[14:27:15] <jasperdegroot> because it was not a bug in 1.4 but a change for 1.5
[14:27:23] <jasperdegroot> which we have to (partly) revert
[14:27:40] <jasperdegroot> I still notice the problem in the demos
[14:27:56] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I could try to be a mentor, but honestly, I'm not sure how responsive I can be :/
[14:28:09] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal_: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8323
[14:28:24] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: its mostly about just being able to help on irc
[14:28:30] <arschmitz> if they ping
[14:28:34] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Gotcha.
[14:28:53] <arschmitz> your a mentor so its just helping them through the process of basicly being a team member
[14:28:57] <arschmitz> and working on their project
[14:29:22] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Then, if we can think of a project, I suppose, you can sign me up. I'll do my best.
[14:29:29] <arschmitz> great!
[14:29:43] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal_: or maybe you mean the original in 6767 is fixed ... that's true. It's just that the fix is wrong. So the "new" issue is described in my comment https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6767#issuecomment-154146618
[14:29:45] <apsdehal_> I can try working on it still. Let me see if I can fix the issue. So final expected behavior is to only scroll to top if ui-content is out of view.
[14:29:57] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal_: that's correct
[14:30:07] <arschmitz> ok so does anyone have ideas of a good GSoC project for JQM
[14:30:18] <arschmitz> i have one already which is "Bug Master"
[14:30:31] <arschmitz> basicly try to work through the back log with a goal of < 100 open issues
[14:30:39] <arschmitz> and to have those 100 be organized and labeled
[14:31:02] <jasperdegroot> isn't that too generic?
[14:31:12] <arschmitz> no
[14:31:15] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:31:30] <gabrielschulhof> In a word ... :)
[14:31:40] <arschmitz> it has a very defined goal less then 100 open issues
[14:31:48] <gabrielschulhof> What about further migration of UI widgets?
[14:31:52] <arschmitz> so they will both triage and fix bugs
[14:32:03] <jasperdegroot> right, but the work that needs to be done is very generic
[14:32:07] <arschmitz> there is a ui one for working on native select
[14:32:11] <arschmitz> yeah thats fine
[14:32:17] <arschmitz> the work does not need to be specific
[14:32:27] <gabrielschulhof> ... only the goal, eh?
[14:32:29] <jasperdegroot> I have to admit that I didn't look into GSoC details because I knew I don't have time to mentor
[14:32:41] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: if you dont you dont and thats fine
[14:32:59] <arschmitz> i understand that completely
[14:33:00] <jasperdegroot> ok then it would be nice of course if someone can help with
[14:33:26] <jasperdegroot> page transitions could be a specific part of the project
[14:33:27] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: if you have project ideas though by all means
[14:33:36] <arschmitz> yeah we had that one last year
[14:33:40] <apsdehal_> jasperdegroot: How I am expected to find if ui-content is out of view, any general solutions?
[14:33:41] <apsdehal_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123999/how-to-tell-if-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-the-current-viewport
[14:33:50] <arschmitz> thats a good one
[14:34:19] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal_: maybe we have some logic for this already in the panel widget
[14:34:26] <jasperdegroot> but not sure
[14:34:38] <arschmitz> there are lots of plugins that do that
[14:34:41] <jasperdegroot> we do check for something to decide if we need to "un-fix" the fixed panel
[14:35:01] <arschmitz> but not a single simple solution besides checking the scroll offset
[14:35:22] <arschmitz> and taking into account position and stuff
[14:35:46] <jasperdegroot> I think we should use getBoundingClientRect
[14:36:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: certainly an option
[14:37:02] <apsdehal_> Yes it is supported in every browser we support
[14:37:11] <arschmitz> yup
[14:37:17] <arschmitz> we get to use all the good stuff now lol
[14:37:34] <gabrielschulhof> Huzzah!
[14:37:54] <arschmitz> ok so last think
[14:37:55] <arschmitz> thing
[14:38:13] <arschmitz> i just wanted to mention that i will be joining the W3C Web Platform group
[14:38:26] <jasperdegroot> oh nice
[14:38:29] <arschmitz> so if we have any concerns on the spec level
[14:38:30] <jasperdegroot> congrats!
[14:38:38] <apsdehal_> Congrats!
[14:38:38] <arschmitz> feel free to let me know
[14:38:41] <cgack> arschmitz: awesome!
[14:38:44] <arschmitz> thank you
[14:38:45] <arschmitz> !
[14:39:24] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Sweet!
[14:39:30] <arschmitz> this is like new thi week so i have not done anything besdes get a member confirmation yet
[14:39:48] <arschmitz> but i want to get a feel for areas different projects have concerns
[14:40:03] <arschmitz> so ping me if anyone has any
[14:40:41] <cogwurx> congrats!
[14:41:02] <arschmitz> oh
[14:41:04] <arschmitz> demos
[14:41:10] <arschmitz> cogwurx: jasperdegroot anything to report
[14:41:10] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:41:22] <jasperdegroot> cogwurx and I talk a bit about that this week
[14:41:30] <jasperdegroot> getting things up to speed
[14:41:31] <cogwurx> working on the CSS now
[14:41:37] <arschmitz> great
[14:41:57] <jasperdegroot> but that build problem ... I have no idea
[14:41:58] <cogwurx> should hopefully have things done tomorrow or early next week for review
[14:42:16] <arschmitz> ok
[14:42:21] <jasperdegroot> so it would be great if someone could take a look at the failing tests
[14:42:23] <arschmitz> i still need to look at that more
[14:42:29] <arschmitz> its got to be something simple
[14:42:37] <arschmitz> it works on 1.5-dev
[14:42:40] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8332
[14:42:41] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Promises suck for absorbing all exceptions - but that's more ECMA than W3C, right?
[14:42:54] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes
[14:43:00] <jasperdegroot> tests are failing for that PR ^^^
[14:43:03] <gabrielschulhof> D'oh!
[14:43:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah i know thats why i was saying it must be something simple in the pr
[14:43:46] <arschmitz> because 1.5-dev is ok and its broken in their its got to be a mangled path or something stupid
[14:43:56] <jasperdegroot> ok great if you can take another look. thanks!
[14:44:18] <arschmitz> because they are just totally broken with undefined errors
[14:44:19] <jasperdegroot> in the mean time cogwurx and I will keep working on getting demos in decent shape for beta
[14:44:25] <arschmitz> great
[14:44:37] <arschmitz> its got to be just not loading something
[14:44:59] <arschmitz> http://localhost:8747/forms-label-hidden-accessible/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css
[14:45:07] <arschmitz> oh yeah thats a bad path alright
[14:45:15] <jasperdegroot> sorry can't reach your localhost ;)
[14:45:27] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats from travis
[14:45:35] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[14:45:43] <arschmitz> but my point is the demo folder dont contain the css folder
[14:45:52] <jasperdegroot> yeah path is wrong
[14:45:56] <arschmitz> thats a totally bad path
[14:46:23] <arschmitz> so its just a broken path somewhere for a demo link i think
[14:46:27] <jasperdegroot> but the problem was that I don't see anything broken when I build local
[14:46:34] <arschmitz> ok
[14:46:52] <arschmitz> ill look
[14:46:58] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I think it showed errors for almost any link
[14:47:18] <arschmitz> yeah looks like all resource links are wrog
[14:47:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: one interesting thing I just noticed
[14:48:07] <agcolom> hi all, sorry on vacation, forgot to say!
[14:48:08] <jasperdegroot> this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8354 showed the same errors
[14:48:27] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: enjoy your vacation!
[14:48:40] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[14:48:59] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no it doesnt https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/100990786
[14:49:04] <arschmitz> the demos pass there
[14:49:09] <arschmitz> the table errors are known
[14:49:21] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ah right, it's just the other errors that are the same
[14:49:22] <arschmitz> they are fixed in the table pr ( though it has other errors )
[14:49:38] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:49:47] <arschmitz> so we can safely ignore those until table lands
[14:50:05] <jasperdegroot> will do
[14:51:14] <arschmitz> ok
[14:51:19] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else
[14:52:20] <jasperdegroot> nope, I am good
[14:52:35] <cgack> I have nothing else
[14:52:45] <apsdehal_> I am good too
[14:53:14] <cogwurx> I cool
[14:53:44] <arschmitz> ok
[14:53:49] <arschmitz> thank you everyone!
[14:53:53] <arschmitz> see everyone back on -dev
[14:53:57] <jasperdegroot> later all
[14:54:45] <cogwurx> later
