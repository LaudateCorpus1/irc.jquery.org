[10:02:12] <sfrisk> errr
[10:02:17] <sfrisk> arthurvr, arschmitz, kristyjy
[10:02:20] <sfrisk> keyboard flail
[10:03:21] <sfrisk> hellooo
[10:03:25] <kristyjy> hello
[10:04:19] <sfrisk> righto then
[10:04:33] <sfrisk> beginning to suspect we should change the time of this meeting, since this starting to not be a good time for people
[10:05:23] <kristyjy> yeah probably not a bad idea. I don't have stand up during it anymore but still second week we've not had people
[10:07:32] <sfrisk> I know arschmitz has a meeting during the first part
[10:07:38] <sfrisk> and this day I often have deploy meetings
[10:09:39] <kristyjy> well I'm normally pretty open my new stand up is at 10:30
[10:10:01] <sfrisk> earlier in the day might work, especially for geekman-rohit
[10:10:18] <sfrisk> I'm going to set up a issue to see if we should revisit the meeting time
[10:10:36] <kristyjy> sounds good!
[10:10:43] <sfrisk> Okay, creating issue now
[10:10:52] <sfrisk> how's the Style Guide going?
[10:14:34] <sfrisk> kristyjy
[10:15:43] <kristyjy> yes it's going pretty good I had planned to discuss comments and how we want to handle them in the style guide with you guys before pushing up my edits but I may just put what I have up for now since the last two meetings haven't really happened
[10:16:10] <sfrisk> Might as well post it, and let people review that way
[10:16:18] <sfrisk> since I think schedules are a bit hectic right now
[10:16:31] <kristyjy> yeah sounds good I'll do that this week
[10:18:34] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:18:36] <sfrisk> in that case
[10:18:43] <sfrisk> I call this meeting to an end
[10:19:08] <sfrisk> also for archive purposes, here is the doodle for the Chassis hack weekend: http://doodle.com/poll/cnvfrddganmk6x85
[10:22:05] <sfrisk> Okay, see everyone later
