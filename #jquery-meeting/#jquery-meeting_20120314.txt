[09:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone!
[09:01:43] <kborchers> ohai
[09:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Infrastructure update?
[09:04:01] <danheberden> zeh puppets are puppetting!
[09:04:26] <danheberden> getting nginx setup for the plugins site atm
[09:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. Will we have a stanging server for the API site too?
[09:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> *staging
[09:05:44] <danheberden> we have staging servers for all sites, except for the static ones, as of now
[09:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:06:08] <danheberden> it's getting the services installed properly on them - but commiting to the puppet-stage branch makes it happen
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I guess we'll see that in action tomorrow when we do our test deploys.
[09:07:04] <danheberden> lets hope so, heh
[09:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Any progress on figuring out the problem with the effects tests?
[09:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> Guess he's not here.
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Are you here?
[09:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> Guess not :-/
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> Well, he made a lot of progress on the new build system.
[09:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> We'll be comparing the output of the new build to the old build this week.
[09:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we can verify that all existing functionality is working as expected.
[09:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> And we've got a lot of new functionality.
[09:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit 1.4.0 was released.
[09:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll be updating all of our branches to use it.
[09:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Docs update?
[09:16:37] <jzaefferer> ello
[09:16:44] <jzaefferer> stupid DST gap
[09:17:23] <jzaefferer> Me actually using grunt caused ben_alman to make a lot of changes to grunt itself (or so I think)
[09:17:47] <jzaefferer> Once the noglobals branch lands in master, I'll update to that
[09:18:10] <jzaefferer> Also the adm-zip module got updated, will give that a try, if it works out, the release task should be cross-platform again
[09:18:20] <jzaefferer> Instead of relying on cli zip and unzip commands
[09:18:27] <danheberden> +1 to the noglobals stuff
[09:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ?
[09:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer went through the TODOs from my accordion review.
[09:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/610
[09:24:52] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by jzaefferer (6d, 21h ago): Accordion cleanup
[09:25:05] <jzaefferer> Ah yeah, still need to land that
[09:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> He addressed everything but the ARIA todos, which Hans will look into.
[09:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> I also removed the ui-accordion-disabled class.
[09:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> Once we have the accordion ARIA issues cleared up, we should do another milestone release.
[09:27:54] <jzaefferer> Its been a while since M6
[09:28:18] <jzaefferer> Can we generate a changelog for all of 1.9?
[09:28:25] <jzaefferer> By now that should look pretty impressive...
[09:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/21
[09:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> Also, grouped by component: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/20
[09:29:12] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: sorry I'm late
[09:29:13] <bot-t> (186 hours ago) <kborchers> tell rworth sorry i missed your ping earlier. if i don't hear from you i'll ping you tomorrow
[09:29:27] <kborchers> lol 186 hours
[09:29:29] <rworth> no update from me on docs
[09:29:50] <rworth> wow, that is late ;)
[09:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> When we finally release 1.9, I expect it to take me a full day to do the release
[09:31:40] <rworth> yeah
[09:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> I've considered starting the changelog ahead of time, but I think it will be a pain to do incremental update.
[09:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> I can start the upgrade guide ahead of time though.
[09:32:53] <rworth> right
[09:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything on the agenda.
[09:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we're done.
[09:35:58] <jzaefferer> Same (weird) time next week, right?
[09:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yup.
