[09:01:19] <jzaefferer> UI meeting! Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4ieJTELlFeUo9ycooPTqWv0gtIt-44T-47Y2F_100U/edit#gid=776389513
[09:01:32] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:48] <jzaefferer> Ping scott_gonzalez arschmitz awayrxaviers fnagel
[09:02:00] <jzaefferer> `uiteam
[09:02:00] <b-ot> jzaefferer: arschmitz fnagel jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers_ scott_gonzalez tjvantoll
[09:02:06] <jzaefferer> yay, bot is back :-)
[09:02:08] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:21] <jzaefferer> though it looks like Scott is n/a
[09:02:37] <jzaefferer> Which also applies to the button review we need
[09:03:16] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:03:20] <jzaefferer> Alex and me were in a meeting with some IBMers today, discussing bidi. We suggested the datepicker rewrite would be a good starting point for them to contribute
[09:03:51] <jzaefferer> so fnagel, if you run into some new people poking at the wiki or PRs, that's likely them
[09:04:04] <fnagel> ok, any plans what they should work on?
[09:04:10] <arschmitz> i can say iv been involved in at least 4 different rounds fo talks to implement rtl in some form and this is the most promising yet i think
[09:04:29] <jzaefferer> fnagel: I was looking at the datepicker and datepicker-globalize-1.x branches earlier, where there is no difference. Is everything merged into datepicker? If so, can we delete the other branch?
[09:04:50] <fnagel> yes, it has been merged
[09:05:16] <jzaefferer> I think the old PR had "text direction for arabic script" as an open issue, that's something they should be able to help with
[09:05:28] <fnagel> could be deleted, but what about the PR? Will it's data been deleted too? Some important infos about RTL
[09:05:39] <jzaefferer> Deleting branches doesn't affect PRs
[09:05:52] <arschmitz> just make sure you close the pr before you delete the branch
[09:05:58] <jzaefferer> Its already closed
[09:06:00] <arschmitz> that locks it
[09:06:01] <fnagel> right
[09:06:01] <arschmitz> ok
[09:06:20] <jzaefferer> fnagel: could you put that information on the wiki page? Closed PR isn't a good source and hard to find
[09:06:38] * rxaviers on standby
[09:06:55] <fnagel> ok, I can try to extract the most useful info
[09:07:41] <fnagel> Wiki page needs some love anyway
[09:08:54] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[09:09:25] <jzaefferer> it doesn't look like anyone from the IBM team is here now, maybe next week
[09:09:56] <arschmitz> they time should not be too terrible for them
[09:10:04] <arschmitz> no worse then you jzaefferer
[09:10:08] <jzaefferer> sure
[09:10:13] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: how's core-breakup going?
[09:10:21] <arschmitz> waiting on trac
[09:10:35] <arschmitz> its completely ready to merge but i need an issue to refrence
[09:10:57] <jzaefferer> ah, alright
[09:11:12] <jzaefferer> you can register a new account and file with that :p
[09:11:20] <arschmitz> i pinged scott_gonzalez but i never heard back so not sure he got it
[09:11:31] <arschmitz> true
[09:11:50] <arschmitz> i might just do that then
[09:12:02] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:12:11] <arschmitz> after that ill rebase button since there is a metric ton of changes on master
[09:12:24] <arschmitz> ( all from me though so oh well )
[09:12:55] <jzaefferer> yeah, fun :-)
[09:13:14] <arschmitz> i just had to change every file 4 times...
[09:13:33] <jzaefferer> From what I've seen from the infrastructure issue, the Trac upgrade is making progress, GitHub auth should be much better than what we have now
[09:13:43] <jzaefferer> Leave it to them to deal with spam accounts
[09:13:46] <arschmitz> yes im excited
[09:13:58] <arschmitz> to actually be able to use trac
[09:14:07] <jzaefferer> And no more spam!?!
[09:14:10] <arschmitz> iv only rarely been able to log in for the last few months
[09:14:38] <jzaefferer> I think that's all for now; I've been working on jquery-license the last few days, looking forward to spending time on interactions later this month and in September
[09:14:49] <arschmitz> oh i wanted to talk about mousewheel
[09:15:16] <jzaefferer> okay, what's up with that?
[09:15:19] <arschmitz> i have that pr pending still and DaveMethvin mentioned he thought we should do a full version bumb
[09:15:35] <arschmitz> the pr about remove the dependency on deprecated and event alias modules
[09:15:38] <jzaefferer> this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mousewheel/pull/138
[09:15:48] <arschmitz> yup
[09:16:45] <jzaefferer> bumping to 4.0.0 seems fine to me
[09:16:59] <arschmitz> yeah whats the release process on this is there one?
[09:17:01] <arschmitz> lol
[09:18:04] <arschmitz> im guessing no since its not even on the cdn
[09:19:39] <arschmitz> oh something else
[09:19:59] <arschmitz> iv been working with the folks at deque on a grunt plugin for accessability testing
[09:20:00] <jzaefferer> npm version major && npm publish?
[09:20:16] <jzaefferer> just commented on the PR, nothing major though
[09:20:23] <arschmitz> might be good once its ready to add it on the demos
[09:21:50] <arschmitz> i have mixed feelings on the whole browserify section on mousewheel i only updated it because it was there and broken we don't support browserify or demo it anywhere else
[09:22:12] <jzaefferer> just delete the readme then :-)
[09:22:30] <arschmitz> works for me
[09:22:40] <arschmitz> and since its a major version
[09:22:51] <arschmitz> easy to just be like yeah we dont do browserify
[09:23:06] <arschmitz> we probably should put this on the cdn though
[09:23:56] <jzaefferer> meh
[09:24:46] <arschmitz> ok
[09:25:44] <arschmitz> ok now thats really all i have lol
[09:26:24] <jzaefferer> alright, thanks everyone
