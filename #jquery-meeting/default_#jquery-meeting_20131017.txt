[11:01:19] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:23] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:01:26] <gseguin> hey
[11:01:53] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:02:02] <agcolom> hi!
[11:02:15] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[11:02:26] <uGoMobi> agenda/updates doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6N33TmpuXK5LxeEHJnjB8uu8fc2iOsqqJDz0tCLZ4s/edit?usp=sharing
[11:02:28] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:02:36] <uGoMobi> hi arschmitz
[11:02:56] <uGoMobi> let's start
[11:03:07] <uGoMobi> the 1.4 RC release
[11:03:19] <gseguin> when?
[11:03:25] <uGoMobi> last week we aimed for releasing by the end of this week
[11:03:33] <uGoMobi> so let's look at open tickets
[11:03:47] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=20&page=1&sort=updated&state=closed
[11:04:07] <uGoMobi> oops... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=20&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:04:14] <uGoMobi> that are the open ones :)
[11:04:56] <uGoMobi> we can still add/fix demos after RC so let's ignore those tickets
[11:05:30] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6604
[11:05:30] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6604 by frequent (3d 7h ago): Fixed footer positioning incorrect if header, footer and panel are outside of page
[11:06:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that looks the same as the issue when you injected the toolbars after pagecreate
[11:06:36] <uGoMobi> for which you added a note to the docs about you need to call $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight
[11:06:53] <uGoMobi> (not sure if that's the correct name of the method)
[11:07:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, is that it? In that case, nice!
[11:07:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It is, AFAIK.
[11:07:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, I don't know if it's the same
[11:07:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you give that one a look
[11:07:36] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:07:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:07:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great, thanks
[11:08:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe we need to put that call to resetActivePageHeight() into the lib - but not before 1.4.0.
[11:08:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you were looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6616 ?
[11:08:13] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6616 by uGoMobi (1d 2h ago): Textinput with disabled attribute doesn't get ui-state-disabled class
[11:08:22] <arschmitz> yes
[11:08:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, maybe
[11:08:52] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6562
[11:08:52] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6562 by botaniQQQ (2w 16m ago): Swipe left panel - moved
[11:09:27] <uGoMobi> I will look into that one ^^^
[11:09:47] <uGoMobi> might have to do with overflow setting in the CSS
[11:10:02] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6500
[11:10:03] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6500 by googol7 (3w 3d ago): iOS 7 homescreen app redirects to other page when widget gets input focus
[11:10:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well 2 issues there
[11:10:37] <arschmitz> one we cant fix its a bug with ios7 webapps
[11:10:57] <arschmitz> the click through to the select
[11:10:58] <uGoMobi> right
[11:11:00] <arschmitz> however
[11:11:09] <arschmitz> it seems that the toolbars are not hiding on focus
[11:11:12] <arschmitz> which they should
[11:11:18] <arschmitz> so need to look at why
[11:11:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:12:05] <uGoMobi> we do UA sniffing for that, right?
[11:12:21] <arschmitz> no
[11:12:30] <arschmitz> its just screen size
[11:12:32] <uGoMobi> oh, that's only for preventFocusZoom
[11:12:37] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:13:47] <uGoMobi> can we do this before RC or does it have to wait until 1.4.1?
[11:14:07] <arschmitz> its a regression
[11:14:09] <arschmitz> so we should
[11:14:26] <arschmitz> fix before rc that is
[11:14:56] <uGoMobi> did you test if it works on iOS6?
[11:15:11] <arschmitz> i did not but i will
[11:15:28] <uGoMobi> could also be a regression in iOS ;)
[11:15:37] <arschmitz> yup ill check
[11:16:07] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6349
[11:16:07] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6349 by uGoMobi (2mon 1d ago): Panel: Page contents disappear when opening a panel on WP8
[11:16:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have you had any signs of hope on that?
[11:16:43] <uGoMobi> I already mentioned that we probably can't fix that one because the same problems happen without JQM
[11:17:16] <uGoMobi> only thing I want to check is why we don't see an issue with fixed toolbars during page transitions
[11:17:59] <uGoMobi> if there is really no solution I will add a note in the docs
[11:18:19] <uGoMobi> last ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5309
[11:18:19] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5309 by Hamdiakoguz (10mon 3w ago): Series 40 and Symbian^3 loading / enhancement issues
[11:18:34] <uGoMobi> we already discussed this before
[11:18:45] <arschmitz> yeah i think this is not for 1.4
[11:18:58] <arschmitz> will need to add a hook for people to add their own logic to bail
[11:19:10] <uGoMobi> the problem is that the support test itself is already causing the platform to crash
[11:19:14] <arschmitz> because we are failing on support tests
[11:19:18] <uGoMobi> right
[11:21:17] <uGoMobi> ok removed the milestone
[11:21:18] <_|Nix|_> The only way I see is with browser sniffing /before/ we run the support tests ... but from what arschmitz has said, you cannot sufficiently distinguish those S40 browsers that crash from those that do not.
[11:22:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also its a platform we dont support
[11:22:21] <arschmitz> so it does not really make sense to add tests for an unsupported platform
[11:22:40] <arschmitz> instead add a hook for people to do them selves if they want
[11:23:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see what you mean, but we also say "any other platform get basic HTML experience"
[11:23:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yeah, it's not like they can if ( wontCrash ) { $( "head" ).append("<script src='jqm.js'></script>")} if it doesn't support DOM manip ...
[11:23:53] <arschmitz> thats a promise we cant possibly deliver on really
[11:24:44] <arschmitz> we run JS so we can never say what crazy js issues could happen
[11:24:54] <arschmitz> in any random browser
[11:25:07] <uGoMobi> true
[11:25:09] <arschmitz> as this issue illustrates
[11:25:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a chicken-and-egg problem: You need to run JS to detect that you must behave as if JS were turned off.
[11:25:51] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:25:57] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[11:26:02] <uGoMobi> see last bullet
[11:26:03] <arschmitz> thats why allow them to run their own tests to disable and have a flag they can set
[11:26:09] <uGoMobi> we have to rephrase that
[11:26:49] <uGoMobi> and remove Nokia Symbian^3 from B-grade
[11:26:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Add a second *Note
[11:27:09] <uGoMobi> because it does not always work
[11:28:11] <_|Nix|_> I guess if we wanted to add a flag for people to set, we'd have to add the codr for checking the flag to the library wrapper.
[11:28:29] <_|Nix|_> That is, build/wrap.start
[11:29:05] <arschmitz> yes first thing we would do is if( $.mobile.disable === true ) { return }
[11:29:11] <arschmitz> or something of that nature
[11:29:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not even. The $.mobile ns may not even be defined.
[11:29:50] <arschmitz> you can check that as well
[11:29:58] <arschmitz> and they would have to define it to set it
[11:31:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thing is, how do you bail on the whole lib? It's a set of IIFEs, so you have to bail from in between two of them.
[11:31:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it would have to in build wrap just as you said
[11:32:06] <uGoMobi> ok, we decided that we can't fix this for 1.4 so let's leave the discussion about how to fix it for another moment
[11:32:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess there's no way around that ...
[11:33:15] <uGoMobi> did anyone see other new issues being reported that we might have to look into before 1.4?
[11:33:49] <_|Nix|_> Not me ...
[11:34:01] <arschmitz> i didnt
[11:34:08] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:35:02] <uGoMobi> then based on the tickets we just discussed I think we should be able to fix those today/tomorrow
[11:35:11] <uGoMobi> agreed?
[11:35:35] <_|Nix|_> ... and then RC on monday?
[11:35:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, releasing on Friday end of the day is never a good idea
[11:36:05] <_|Nix|_> Agreed. Cool! +1
[11:36:07] <uGoMobi> I have to write a little blog post too
[11:36:30] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:36:35] <uGoMobi> I suggest code freeze at end of the day tomorrow
[11:36:58] <uGoMobi> when you think of something urgent this weekend we can look into it Monday morning before release
[11:37:13] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:37:16] <arschmitz> ok
[11:37:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ^^^
[11:38:07] <uGoMobi> then I would like to do quick status check of all things we need to do before 1.4 final
[11:38:29] <uGoMobi> demos... http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/
[11:38:33] <_|Nix|_> I still need to add all the $.mobile.path methods to the API docs.
[11:38:44] <_|Nix|_> I mean the rest of them.
[11:38:52] <uGoMobi> I will make a new homepage for the demos
[11:39:09] <arschmitz> i have a couple new demos i want to add
[11:39:12] <_|Nix|_> I have this idea of creating a subcategory under methods for path, but I'm not having any luck introducing subcategories. I need scott_gonzalez's help.
[11:39:32] <uGoMobi> the custom JS, global nav and search has been fixed and demos-nav has been merged into master
[11:40:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So I can go ahead with my find/cat/awk/sed?
[11:40:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes!
[11:40:25] <_|Nix|_> Boo-yah!
[11:40:35] * _|Nix|_ fires up the chainsaw
[11:40:41] <uGoMobi> I think all demos are in shape now
[11:41:07] <uGoMobi> only the grunticon demo needs some text
[11:41:13] <uGoMobi> it's more a test page now
[11:41:41] <uGoMobi> will open a ticket for that
[11:41:55] <uGoMobi> API docs...
[11:41:59] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I still need to make a test page for the FF bug ...
[11:42:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the iframe?
[11:42:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[11:42:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: miketaylr already did
[11:42:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think Mike already did
[11:42:41] <_|Nix|_> Oh, cooL!
[11:43:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz can you add in the agenda doc what API docs updates still need to be done
[11:44:32] <miketaylr> yeah i did thanks guys
[11:44:47] <_|Nix|_> miketaylr: Thank you!
[11:44:49] <miketaylr> and thanks _|Nix|_ for taking the time to report ^_^
[11:45:07] <_|Nix|_> miketaylr: NP.
[11:46:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz : I like to get an idea of how much still needs to be done for 1.4 final
[11:46:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure ill do a pass through
[11:47:03] <arschmitz> and see what i notice is left
[11:47:26] <_|Nix|_> Yes, please! I've been working with the API docs for so long I'm totally lost.
[11:48:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you have time to help with updating API docs?
[11:48:24] <agcolom> very tricky at the moment (teaching 16h per week)
[11:48:32] <agcolom> plus preparation
[11:48:36] <uGoMobi> ah ok, I understand
[11:49:12] <agcolom> I'll be doing 4h less in a few weeks
[11:49:20] <uGoMobi> I am currently working on the ThemeRoller update which will cost me some time and after that I take care of the new web site
[11:49:44] <uGoMobi> also have to finish the upgrade guide and demos homepage
[11:50:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz : I hope that you can take care of the API docs
[11:50:39] <uGoMobi> not sure how much time you guys have
[11:50:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I know I need to add the rest of the path methods.
[11:50:54] <uGoMobi> have available I mean
[11:51:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, less than I used to, now with all the Cordova stuff ... *sigh* ...
[11:51:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But I still have some ...
[11:52:32] <uGoMobi> I don't want too much time between RC and final
[11:52:39] <arschmitz> i agree
[11:53:04] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:53:31] <uGoMobi> so if we release RC on Monday I think we should release final one week later
[11:53:42] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[11:53:44] <uGoMobi> and I am not sure if we can make that
[11:54:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, at the very least before Amsterdam.
[11:54:38] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:54:44] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away: are you still here?
[11:54:50] <_|Nix|_> We should be able to do it.
[11:55:40] <uGoMobi> the download builder doesn't work with 1.4
[11:55:53] <arschmitz> thats the real blocker
[11:56:29] <arschmitz> if gseguin|away is not around to release i can do it but hes the only one that really knows download builder
[11:56:50] <uGoMobi> maybe Rafael can help already
[11:57:11] <arschmitz> yeah sadly they are nothing alike :(
[11:57:26] <arschmitz> iv looked at builder before though so maybe i can figure it out
[11:57:42] <uGoMobi> that would be great
[11:57:53] <uGoMobi> but you can't do everything at the same time
[11:58:02] <arschmitz> that is very true
[11:58:09] <uGoMobi> so I think we should wait with RC release
[11:58:10] <arschmitz> only so much time
[11:58:16] <uGoMobi> the open issues is not a problem
[11:58:28] <uGoMobi> but we don't have everything else ready in a week
[11:59:48] <arschmitz> i think api and demos can be ready i just dont know about builder
[11:59:59] <arschmitz> ill try to look today / tomorrow maybe its something simple
[12:00:04] <arschmitz> i can hope right?
[12:00:16] <uGoMobi> yeah demos are almost done and not critical
[12:00:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Amen!
[12:00:41] <uGoMobi> I mean, demos are updated, we are only talking about adding more
[12:00:48] <arschmitz> right
[12:01:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe _|Nix|_ can look into textinput disabled issue
[12:01:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that should be simple
[12:01:26] <uGoMobi> so you have time for the builder
[12:01:41] <arschmitz>  actually i already know what it is
[12:01:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:02:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: widget factory used to add class ui-state-disabled
[12:02:25] <arschmitz> but it does not any more
[12:02:31] <arschmitz> so we need to do it
[12:02:43] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[12:02:55] <arschmitz> just need to add that in set options
[12:02:56] <uGoMobi> the other widgets were not affected
[12:02:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that thing ... dang!
[12:03:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we aready fixed the rest
[12:03:09] <uGoMobi> do we add the class ourselves there?
[12:03:11] <arschmitz> as people reported them
[12:03:21] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:03:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The whole point of moving away from ui-disabled was to take advantage of ui-state-disabled ... and now that's gone too :)
[12:03:45] <arschmitz> iv seen this come through one widget at a time but didnt really put it all together until now :)
[12:03:59] <arschmitz> thought we just sucked at writing disabled code :)
[12:04:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it adds a widget specific disabled class now
[12:04:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Always has, IINM ...
[12:04:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but it also added ui-state-disabled.
[12:04:52] <arschmitz> yeah but removed the other so thats all it adds i mean
[12:05:45] <uGoMobi> ok, let's first fix the open issues
[12:05:56] <_|Nix|_> Right. Well, I can do it ... in fact, I'll do it real fast.
[12:06:10] <uGoMobi> and then look into what needs to be done to get API docs in shape for final release
[12:07:01] <uGoMobi> it would be great if we have an overview of that at Monday end of the day
[12:07:14] <uGoMobi> then we can decide if we can release RC on Tuesday
[12:07:38] <uGoMobi> so I suggest we do another status check on Monday
[12:07:48] <arschmitz> sounds good
[12:07:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : what do you think?
[12:08:32] <uGoMobi> I will try hard to have the TR finished by Monday
[12:08:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: +1
[12:09:08] <uGoMobi> then I have rest of the week for new web site and final blog post
[12:10:09] <uGoMobi> ok great
[12:10:48] <uGoMobi> new PR's... this can wait for now
[12:11:01] <arschmitz> yup
[12:11:08] <uGoMobi> we look into them when we are done with 1.4
[12:11:14] <_|Nix|_> +1
[12:11:16] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss now?
[12:12:25] <uGoMobi> I think we can go back to -dev
[12:12:28] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
