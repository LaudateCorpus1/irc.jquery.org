[09:00:03] <timmywil> markelog, DaveMethvin, m_gol meetingz
[09:00:13] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:00:18] <DaveMethvin> present
[09:00:34] <timmywil> gonna be short. I need to leave for a physical in 30 min.
[09:00:45] <markelog> is everything okay?
[09:00:48] <timmywil> gotta get physical
[09:00:54] <timmywil> yea, just a yearly thing
[09:01:11] <timmywil> I hope it's all okay! Need to quit smoking...
[09:01:17] <markelog> even a ferrari needs a tuneup )
[09:01:26] <markelog> you smoke?
[09:01:36] <timmywil> some days
[09:01:55] <DaveMethvin> days ending in "y"?
[09:01:55] <markelog> wow, i thought i'm only one in the planet that still does that )
[09:02:10] <DaveMethvin> you guys, give that stuff up!
[09:02:12] <timmywil> you, me, and gnarf holding down the fort
[09:02:28] <DaveMethvin> at least switch to the electronic ciggy machines
[09:02:29] <timmywil> I don't wanna! ...but I do.
[09:02:45] <timmywil> anyway
[09:02:52] <markelog> i guess i will be buried with a sig in my mouth
[09:03:06] <markelog> okay, do we have something important?
[09:03:13] <markelog> to discuss i mean?
[09:03:21] <timmywil> I think we've covered most of the PRs in past meetings
[09:03:27] <timmywil> Just a few issues to discuss
[09:03:28] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/352
[09:03:33] <timmywil> Sizzle.noConflict
[09:03:42] <timmywil> I'm surprised we never added this before
[09:03:55] <DaveMethvin> seems useful when using Sizzle by itself
[09:04:00] <timmywil> yea
[09:04:08] <timmywil> we could even remove it in the jQuery build
[09:04:52] <markelog> hey Richard!
[09:04:56] <timmywil> by simply sticking it in the // EXPOSE block
[09:05:15] <timmywil> hey gibson0421
[09:05:15] <gibson0421> ahoy!
[09:05:22] <timmywil> Sizzle.noConflict?
[09:05:32] <timmywil> was thinking we could remove it in the jQuery build
[09:05:35] <markelog> gibson042: talking about https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/352
[09:06:01] <timmywil> we remove the window.Sizzle assignment anyway
[09:07:10] <gibson042> can you ~~hear~~ read me now?
[09:07:15] <markelog> yep
[09:07:19] <timmywil> yerp
[09:07:25] <gibson042> good
[09:07:31] <DaveMethvin> no keyboard, press F1 to continue
[09:07:37] <markelog> )
[09:07:40] <timmywil> alt+F3
[09:08:01] <timmywil> or was it F4. I ain't no windows user.
[09:08:17] <timmywil> gibson042: so, you for Sizzle.noConflict?
[09:08:33] <gibson042> I'm leaning towards yes
[09:08:48] <gibson042> inside the EXPOSE block so it's removed by library inclusion
[09:08:54] <timmywil> yup, cool
[09:09:05] <markelog> did we started discussion with edge team?
[09:09:22] <markelog> like on focus(in | out) issue - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2389
[09:09:23] <markelog> ?
[09:09:47] <markelog> since they made the release
[09:10:03] <markelog> i think we should hoping for them to fix it, in the next version?
[09:10:05] <timmywil> I forgot
[09:10:14] <timmywil> I'll email them
[09:10:17] <markelog> cool
[09:10:21] <markelog> will you cc us?
[09:10:23] <DaveMethvin> i am talking with Microsoft about CI for their app environment, jdalton is working on a solution
[09:10:34] <DaveMethvin> i suspect things are crazy there, with all the bugs they're stomping
[09:10:41] <markelog> really?
[09:10:49] <markelog> i thought there isn't much of them?
[09:11:02] <markelog> we found couple
[09:11:07] <markelog> and bootstrap team one
[09:11:13] <markelog> is there anything else?
[09:11:20] <DaveMethvin> general crashes and hangs
[09:11:42] <DaveMethvin> happens to me when i bring up their dev tools sometimes
[09:11:49] <markelog> hm, didn't heard about, but again, i'm also no win user )
[09:12:17] <timmywil> we talked about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2541 (cache node_modules in Travis) last week, but I didn't write a resolution. Just want to confirm we decided to not do that.
[09:12:24] <markelog> although, i think we should start the discussion anyway, since they might go in the wrong way
[09:12:32] <markelog> like focus issue is tricky
[09:12:46] <timmywil> agreed, we'll catch up about it
[09:12:46] <DaveMethvin> definitely
[09:12:47] <markelog> pretty easy to remove support for those evetns
[09:13:04] <markelog> timmywil: yeah, we don't do that
[09:13:10] <markelog> at least right now
[09:13:13] <timmywil> right
[09:13:31] <markelog> will close this with explanation
[09:13:40] <timmywil> Finally, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2555 hide jQuery.acceptData
[09:13:45] <timmywil> I'm not sure if plugins use this
[09:13:56] <markelog> i don't think they do
[09:14:02] <markelog> plus wasn't documented
[09:14:12] <markelog> seems pretty clear we should hide it
[09:14:18] <timmywil> If we think it *could* be useful, we could document.
[09:14:28] <DaveMethvin> it was a lot more important in the oldIE days
[09:14:35] <timmywil> true
[09:14:38] <timmywil> well
[09:14:48] <timmywil> we don't allow data on object elements in compat
[09:14:51] <markelog> yeah, but you still can find text node and try to attach data to it
[09:15:11] <timmywil> because IE8
[09:15:11] <markelog> although, it seems that stuff should be incapsulated in the data api
[09:15:38] <timmywil> I've run into this in jquery.panzoom
[09:15:43] <markelog> ooo
[09:16:08] <markelog> you couldn't solved without that method?
[09:16:13] <markelog> or you implement your own
[09:16:14] <markelog> ?
[09:16:16] <timmywil> Theoretically, i could use acceptData to warn users about trying to instantiate the plugin on objects
[09:16:34] <timmywil> if using jQuery 2.0, it would work
[09:16:38] <timmywil> if using 1.x, it wouldn't
[09:17:00] <markelog> what do you do now?
[09:17:09] <timmywil> I just added a note in the README
[09:17:19] <timmywil> but it fails silently
[09:17:31] <timmywil> events can't be added
[09:18:13] <markelog> i'd say it is your call then, it seems though it will not find wide use
[09:18:18] <DaveMethvin> i was trying to remember how we got into checking for these crazy things anyway
[09:18:22] <markelog> we could ask ui/mobile about this too
[09:18:34] <DaveMethvin> like text nodes, which we generally don't support fully
[09:18:39] <markelog> you could do content().data()
[09:18:48] <DaveMethvin> IF YOU WERE CRAZY
[09:18:50] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:18:52] <markelog> )
[09:19:26] <timmywil> ok, let's ask UI/mobile. If they don't want it, we'll hide it.
[09:19:37] <markelog> i have another item
[09:19:40] <timmywil> sure
[09:19:47] <markelog> it seems when we released alpha
[09:19:55] <markelog> ppl focused on the wrong thing
[09:20:18] <markelog> i think we could reach out to Addy or Paul about this hide/show bussiness
[09:20:29] <markelog> so they would tweet or blog post about ot
[09:20:30] <markelog> it
[09:21:08] <timmywil> what do you mean focused on thee wrong thing? what did they focus on?
[09:21:14] <markelog> yandex.browser
[09:21:20] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[09:21:20] <timmywil> ah
[09:21:22] <markelog> (
[09:21:39] <markelog> that drama cluttered everything it seems
[09:22:01] <markelog> i can write them a letter
[09:22:15] <markelog> if that is feasible
[09:22:19] <DaveMethvin> i talked with paul_irish about whether the console could issue some sort of warning, it could be tricky to do that without making it noisy
[09:22:40] <DaveMethvin> "you're using an old jQuery that's taking a lot of time to show/hide, upgrade to 3.0"
[09:22:58] <DaveMethvin> the "taking a lot of time" is critical, don't want to always yell about this
[09:23:03] <markelog> didn't they already do that/
[09:23:13] <markelog> not specially for hide/show
[09:23:18] <DaveMethvin> but also we need to get the word out about how to rewrite code for this change
[09:23:18] <markelog> but for any slow function
[09:23:31] <DaveMethvin> and also have a 3.0 Migrate that restores it
[09:23:41] <markelog> i'd say we still on the "wait and see" phase
[09:23:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i wish more people had given us feedback
[09:23:58] <markelog> lots of people said they will not upgrade to the new version
[09:24:05] <markelog> yeah )
[09:24:15] <timmywil> not for slow functons exactly; they notify about methods that force synchronous layouts or cause reflows
[09:24:17] <markelog> that is why i'm thinking we should reach out to the "thought leaders" )
[09:24:46] <markelog> timmywil: right
[09:25:22] <timmywil> we could also do a blog post on the jQuery blog asking for more feedback
[09:25:32] <markelog> two fronts better then one )
[09:25:43] <markelog> +1 i mean
[09:26:55] <timmywil> gibson042 added this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2534
[09:26:59] <timmywil> async converters
[09:27:02] <markelog> so how about it? blog post and the letter?
[09:27:15] <timmywil> letter?
[09:27:21] <DaveMethvin> do we want to do another alpha maybe?
[09:27:30] <DaveMethvin> new code at least spurs people to test
[09:27:39] <DaveMethvin> better than a month-old alpha
[09:27:46] <markelog> yeah, to the addy or/and paul
[09:27:59] <markelog> +1
[09:28:05] <markelog> three fronts better then two )
[09:28:20] <DaveMethvin> maybe we could send something to the three browsers we talk to regularly about the issue
[09:28:26] <timmywil> oh, yea, I mean. With the size of their audience, I think all we need is retweets.
[09:28:34] <DaveMethvin> i think we have good channels now
[09:28:44] <DaveMethvin> all but safari but what else is new
[09:28:49] <timmywil> heh
[09:28:57] <timmywil> what would we ask them?
[09:29:08] <timmywil> I'm not a big fan of browser warnings
[09:29:25] <DaveMethvin> feedback on our show/hide changes, whether they think the change is worth the pain
[09:29:40] <markelog> or maybe there is some better way
[09:29:49] <DaveMethvin> if we can't get a very large chunk of existing users to upgrade to 3.0 then i think that would be a mess
[09:30:28] <timmywil> you know, I'm not even sure this is as big of an issue in Firefox/IE
[09:30:29] <DaveMethvin> i mean it's always a matter of time passing, nobody just drops in the new code, but we have a decade of info about the current show/hide behavior all over the net
[09:30:37] <timmywil> we've only really tested v8
[09:31:04] <DaveMethvin> altho i think reading before write on a dirty layout is bad for everyone
[09:31:17] <timmywil> yea
[09:31:20] <DaveMethvin> we just don't have exact numbers on how bad
[09:31:35] <markelog> yeah, although, people could switch to their own implemenation if browser would warn me
[09:31:37] <markelog> *them
[09:31:52] <markelog> if perf is that bad
[09:31:56] <timmywil> ha, what would that implementation look like
[09:32:21] <DaveMethvin> that's where i think we have work to do, need to explain how to change existing code
[09:32:25] <markelog> same thing what we have in the alpha?
[09:32:28] <DaveMethvin> and it has to be possible for a dev to do so
[09:32:36] <DaveMethvin> which could be tricky in the case of plugins
[09:32:51] <markelog> for the plugins, we don't have a solution yet
[09:33:03] <markelog> as scott_gonzalez mentioned
[09:33:17] <timmywil> well, we do, but they have to determine the display value themselves
[09:33:25] <timmywil> which is arguably not a solution
[09:33:31] <timmywil> I wonder if exposing a defaultDisplay is helpful for plugins
[09:33:39] <markelog> more or less
[09:33:56] <DaveMethvin> if it's helpful then there shoudl be a standard DOM api for it
[09:34:02] <DaveMethvin> ours is flakey
[09:34:03] <markelog> big +1
[09:34:10] <timmywil> wow, that's a great idea
[09:34:11] <markelog> mozilla did it
[09:34:22] <DaveMethvin> and now are removing it, right?
[09:34:25] <markelog> but other browsers didn't support it
[09:34:32] <markelog> and they diid it wrong
[09:34:41] <markelog> not fully
[09:35:03] <markelog> we could resurrect that discussion
[09:35:22] <gibson042> what people really want isn't even defaultDisplay, it's more like "what would this element be if it were not display: none?"
[09:35:23] <markelog> although i'm not sure if that would help
[09:35:41] <timmywil> gibson042: well, that's what I think of when I say defaultDisplay
[09:35:44] <markelog> and we remember previous display value
[09:35:55] <timmywil> respecting the cascade included
[09:35:58] <markelog> i'm not sure how dom api would allow that
[09:36:17] <gibson042> but defaultDisplay input is nodeName, not element
[09:36:34] <markelog> details of terminalogy
[09:36:36] <markelog> )
[09:37:06] <timmywil> gibson042: ok, we can use a different word
[09:37:10] <DaveMethvin> most of the time i think the top-level dev knows whether an element is block or inline or table-row or whatever, and much of the time a plugin writer would as well (e.g. dialogs are none/block and never table-cell)
[09:37:31] <markelog> okay, so blog post for the feedback, then reach out to the addy/paul?
[09:37:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: good point
[09:37:54] <markelog> could be inline-block
[09:37:57] <timmywil> but this information must be in the C code somewhere
[09:38:01] <DaveMethvin> DAMN YOU MARKELOG
[09:38:02] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:38:05] <markelog> ))
[09:38:12] <timmywil> they parse the stylesheet and know the user agent stylesheet
[09:38:31] <timmywil> it shouldn't be hard to get that value in C without forcing layout
[09:38:38] <markelog> so addition to the blog post a letter to vendor devs?
[09:38:43] <DaveMethvin> at worst they'd need to reapply styles but not force layout to get that info
[09:39:17] <timmywil> anyway, I've gotta run
[09:39:26] <DaveMethvin> ok, be healthy timmywil
[09:39:32] <markelog> okay, i will wrote a letter to jquery-dev
[09:39:33] <timmywil> you guys want to discuss async converters before closing?
[09:39:42] <markelog> and we can continue this discussion there?
[09:39:49] <timmywil> markelog: thanks, sounds good
[09:39:52] <markelog> cool
[09:39:58] <timmywil> gibson042: ^
[09:40:03] <timmywil> wanna take over?
[09:40:13] <gibson042> discussion can take place on the ticket
[09:40:22] <timmywil> ok, in that case, thanks all
[09:40:31] <gibson042> I just wanted the team to consider it in a "do we actually want to do this" sense
[09:41:15] <m_gol> duh, missed the meeting
[09:41:20] <m_gol> bad day
[09:41:26] <timmywil> I kind of like it only because of the way the new fetch api works
[09:41:38] <timmywil> my 2 cents
[09:41:55] <timmywil> ok, need to go, bye everyone!
[09:41:59] <markelog> see ya!
[09:42:02] <m_gol> cu
[09:42:17] <markelog> +0, you already can do that, but it seems to follow current thrend
[09:43:09] <gibson042> updated to reference issue instead of PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2532
[09:45:02] <markelog> it seems we're done?
[09:45:03] <m_gol> markelog: how are you with the style/QUnit updates PR?
[09:45:16] <markelog> didn't have the time, hoping for tomorrow
[09:45:23] <m_gol> ok
[09:45:33] <m_gol> I have a PR streak waiting and a couple of non-mine PRs also seem good to land
[09:45:35] <m_gol> after rebasing
[09:45:43] <m_gol> this will be painful :D
[09:45:46] <markelog> i remember )
[09:46:01] <m_gol> :)
[09:48:33] <markelog> DaveMethvin/gibson042: i guess we can close the room?
[09:48:40] <gibson042> aye
[09:54:09] <gibson042> hmm, I am not authorized... DaveMethvin?
[09:55:16] <m_gol> or scott_gonzalez?
[09:55:29] <m_gol> (or arschmitz?)
