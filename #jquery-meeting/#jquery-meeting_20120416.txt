[09:01:27] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:01:30] <DaveMethvin> yay
[09:01:48] <DaveMethvin> just a minute
[09:03:03] <mikesherov> here
[09:03:03] <bot-t> (2 hours 46 mins ago) <ajpiano> tell mikesherov when you get a chance, RSVP for that thing plz :)
[09:03:03] <bot-t> (2 hours 45 mins ago) <ajpiano> tell mikesherov otherwise i don't thing nothing in terms of prep
[09:03:36] <sindresorhus_> here too
[09:04:28] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then
[09:05:18] <DaveMethvin> anybody else here?
[09:05:31] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov and sindresorhus i got  you guys
[09:05:36] <ajpiano> i'm "here"
[09:05:37] <ajpiano> :p
[09:06:05] <DaveMethvin> that's funny, i've always heard ppl say you're not all there
[09:06:20] <DaveMethvin> ok, so this can prolly be a short meeting
[09:06:30] <DaveMethvin> i've updated the agenda
[09:06:47] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron is on a plane to boston atm, but he now has commit
[09:07:00] <DaveMethvin> so send him a hearty pull request
[09:07:47] <DaveMethvin> on triage, i think we still have a few bugs to stab here, and i need to catch up with pull request activity
[09:08:20] <DaveMethvin> did anyone else get a chance to look at gnarf's animation work?
[09:08:28] <mikesherov> I did
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> and what did you think?
[09:09:07] <DaveMethvin> looked a lot nicer to me
[09:09:15] <DaveMethvin> i wish it were smaller
[09:09:27] <DaveMethvin> but gibson042 did a good job of removing bytes
[09:09:52] <mikesherov> yeah, I think there are some ways to make it even smaller
[09:10:03] <mikesherov> I haven't really gone through it with a fine tooth comb yet
[09:10:18] <DaveMethvin> that's what i like to hear!
[09:10:24] <sindresorhus_> I thought the intention of the rewrite was to make it smaller?
[09:10:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah sindresorhus that's why i'd like to see it get smaller
[09:10:51] <DaveMethvin> we may be able to identify things to be pulled out
[09:11:00] <DaveMethvin> altho it passes current unit tests
[09:11:02] <mikesherov> the intention I believe was to make it an extension point so that it could work with another animation framework altogether, no?
[09:11:12] <DaveMethvin> well two things
[09:11:24] <DaveMethvin> a major goal of 1.8 is smaller
[09:11:36] <DaveMethvin> but the animation rewrite was supposed to allow better extensibility
[09:11:45] <gnarf> which it does ;)
[09:11:48] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:11:50] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[09:12:19] <gnarf> i gotta run "soonish" - richard and i are heading out to lunch
[09:12:23] <mikesherov> My goals for 1.8: remove archaic crap, make border-box work, and make ready more readier
[09:12:26] <sindresorhus_> It's also cleaner and easier to apprehend
[09:12:37] <DaveMethvin> amen sindresorhus
[09:12:49] <DaveMethvin> so the animation rewrite is the most extensible, good looking, bloated code you'll ever see
[09:12:50] <gnarf> I still need some help with "performance" and "memory" testing that 1.8 branch
[09:12:53] * DaveMethvin runs away from gnarf
[09:13:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah the mem leaks is something we do need to check
[09:13:29] <gnarf> im a little scared to see if they exist
[09:14:02] <gnarf> but if they do - as long as someone can help me figure out how i test them, i can probably fix them - I've done a lot of mem testing before, just not in JS
[09:14:25] <gnarf> i just know people report mem leaks with new ajax code
[09:14:41] <gnarf> and I kinda wanna make sure that the new animation code doesn't leak because it also uses deferreds
[09:14:54] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:14:58] <gibson042> hello
[09:15:59] <DaveMethvin> i want to see if we can land the new grunt stuff, any concerns before i do that?
[09:16:11] <mikesherov> I love that idea Dave
[09:16:13] <DaveMethvin> i want to check with rwaldron to see if he has any updates
[09:16:31] <mikesherov> the only problem I have with grunt is getting it to work on windows
[09:16:32] <sindresorhus_> Yeah, grunt ftw +++
[09:16:41] <mikesherov> I still use windows
[09:16:46] <sindresorhus_> what?!?!
[09:16:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i have to resolve the problem of needing different versions of node in windows to get master vs 1.8pre to run
[09:17:02] <mikesherov> Right
[09:17:04] <DaveMethvin> so you and i can figger that out
[09:17:10] <mikesherov> OK, sounds great
[09:17:19] <mikesherov> I still use XP on a 5 year old laptop :-P
[09:17:26] <sindresorhus_> ....
[09:17:52] <mikesherov> but we should land grunt as soon as possible
[09:17:52] <sindresorhus_> I don't understand how anyone can do dev on Windows
[09:17:57] <mikesherov> the less languages in the code, the better
[09:18:08] <mikesherov> I was getting trolled by wycats pretty hard about PHP
[09:18:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: is there no "nave" for windows?
[09:18:32] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[09:18:42] <mikesherov> ajpiano: I'm on the waitlist for that event
[09:19:23] <DaveMethvin> ok, back
[09:19:39] <DaveMethvin> i'm using cygwin, couldn't work on jquery without it
[09:19:44] <mikesherov> same for me
[09:19:47] <mikesherov> I use cygwin
[09:20:03] <mikesherov> and it has a problem resolving pathnames for npm packages :\
[09:20:04] <gibson042> thirded for cygwin
[09:20:06] <DaveMethvin> haven't used nave
[09:20:21] <DaveMethvin> just saw it
[09:20:28] <DaveMethvin> that might solve our probelm
[09:20:43] <DaveMethvin> (knowing windows it could just as easily make it worse :P)
[09:20:59] <DaveMethvin> ok so CCAO
[09:21:10] <DaveMethvin> that's what I'm proposing for now
[09:21:42] <DaveMethvin> we really do need to have 1.8 work with it but i'd like to dump the responsiblity into the laps of the 2-14 people who really want it
[09:22:03] <DaveMethvin> and if we get no enthusiastic response then that tells us what kind of priority it shoudl get going forward
[09:22:10] <mikesherov> who are these people?
[09:22:19] <sindresorhus_> ^
[09:22:21] <DaveMethvin> i don't know
[09:22:23] <mikesherov> I'm just curious
[09:22:33] <mikesherov> i.e. how do we put it in their laps?
[09:22:50] <DaveMethvin> create a branch that adds all the jsdoc so ccao can work
[09:23:09] <sindresorhus_> Do we have any numbers on the byte savings?
[09:23:26] <DaveMethvin> well, the changes required in core added about 200 bytes to the min-gzip
[09:23:37] <DaveMethvin> so negative 200 bytes saved! :D
[09:23:42] <sindresorhus_> Yeah!
[09:23:48] <DaveMethvin> which is another reason i don't want to land it in master
[09:24:23] <DaveMethvin> but it could end up being a pain to leave out the necessary code changes, so i only want to do it until we find out if people are going to use it in 1.8
[09:24:28] <mikesherov> yeah, I mean, I'm down with maintaining jsdocs, but only if it's really a huge win and people want it
[09:24:41] <gnarf>  /agree
[09:24:47] <DaveMethvin> if there really is demand we can land the 200 bytes, and possibly the jsdocs
[09:24:57] <mikesherov> OK, sounds good to me
[09:25:04] <mikesherov> forever the pragmatist
[09:25:15] <mikesherov> we should still give chad a free beer for all the hard work
[09:25:21] <sindresorhus_> What kind of savings are we talking about, with the advanced flag? Just curious.
[09:25:30] <mikesherov> sindresorhus, it depends
[09:25:36] <DaveMethvin> depends on the code you compile it with
[09:25:39] * gnarf needs to run - if anyone gets a chance to look @ 1.8-effects on my fork in further detail - you know where to find me ;)
[09:25:39] <sindresorhus_> Yes, he has done some awesome work.
[09:26:04] <mikesherov> we should see what the file size is if you compile it with literally something like $(element).show();
[09:26:30] <sindresorhus_> agree
[09:26:41] <DaveMethvin> our stuff gets maybe 200 bigger but let's say you bundle that with 200kb of jQueryUI and other user code, it might save thousands of bytes
[09:27:02] <sindresorhus_> True
[09:27:04] <DaveMethvin> so the idea is that the net of the combined code is smaller
[09:27:06] <DaveMethvin> BUT
[09:27:11] <DaveMethvin> you have to do a build step
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> most web sites don't have build steps
[09:27:27] <sindresorhus_> grunt task?
[09:27:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but we need to decide how much of that hand holding the jQuery project does for people
[09:27:55] <DaveMethvin> grunt may be a big win here
[09:27:58] <sindresorhus_> coffescript, less, sass, etc. a lot of websites do builds at the moment
[09:28:09] <DaveMethvin> you'd think so, but not the ones I see
[09:28:27] <DaveMethvin> i just dunno if the people complaining about size are also the ones who really try to reduce their own bytes
[09:28:34] <DaveMethvin> they may just be bitching AND lazy
[09:29:11] <sindresorhus_> I have a feeling a lot of people hear from "someone" that jQuery is "bloated" and just wants to complain.
[09:29:29] <DaveMethvin> i want to do a blog post on the whole process
[09:29:53] <DaveMethvin> b/c no matter what we cut, it won't make that big a diff in the size of most web sites
[09:30:09] <DaveMethvin> big web sites pull down 500k or more of assets
[09:30:12] <DaveMethvin> and we're 32k
[09:30:22] <DaveMethvin> so if we slimmed down to 20k
[09:30:25] <DaveMethvin> BFD
[09:30:35] <sindresorhus_> And even soo, there are other ways you can save even more bytes, like compressing png, css, etc..
[09:30:36] <mikesherov> it's more about people looking at zepto, or mathias's blog post, and badnwagoning
[09:30:42] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:31:01] <DaveMethvin> hey i know how we can reduce size, we can remove all semicolons like zepto! :D
[09:31:05] <sindresorhus_> I cut down my site in half by compressing pngs
[09:31:08] <sindresorhus_> haha, yeah
[09:31:16] <mikesherov> SEMICOLONS
[09:31:35] <sindresorhus_> ;
[09:31:42] <DaveMethvin> i love brandon's reply on that... ASI is an error correction process !
[09:31:58] <DaveMethvin> okay, anyways
[09:32:03] <DaveMethvin> on the remaining 1.8 stuff, i need to ping timmywil on the sizzle changes
[09:32:24] <DaveMethvin> anyone else have issues to discuss?
[09:32:43] <mikesherov> yeah, I just want opinions on jQuery.quickReady
[09:32:51] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i had a question
[09:32:53] <DaveMethvin> on that
[09:33:11] <mikesherov> sure
[09:33:12] <DaveMethvin> our current ready handling, does it consistenly wait for iframes across browsers?
[09:33:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: really busy with work. I have set aside this Saturday to get the bulk of it done. Sorry it's taking a while.
[09:33:22] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: no.
[09:33:22] <DaveMethvin> k thanks timmywil
[09:33:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wondered
[09:33:41] <mikesherov> so, without quickReady existing:
[09:33:55] <mikesherov> 1. oldIE waits for IFRAMES because they don't have DomContentLoaded
[09:34:26] <mikesherov> 2. async loaded standards browsers wait for IFRAMES because DomContentLoaded already fired
[09:34:35] <mikesherov> that's the situation
[09:34:46] <mikesherov> that's what quickReady attacks
[09:34:54] <DaveMethvin> so can we get away with saying that in 1.8 we are consistently NOT waiting for iframes across browsers and eliminate the need for quickReady?
[09:35:02] <DaveMethvin> or more accurately
[09:35:06] <DaveMethvin> not caring about iframes?
[09:35:12] <mikesherov> correct.
[09:35:18] <mikesherov> that would be the breaking change
[09:35:28] <mikesherov> and would be way smaller
[09:35:32] <DaveMethvin> but only breaking for some browsers with some ways of loading?
[09:36:00] <mikesherov> breaking specifically for oldIE and async loaded jQuery in newer browsers
[09:36:21] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:36:28] <mikesherov> but really, people should be using $(window).load() is they want to wait for subresources
[09:36:37] <mikesherov> if*
[09:36:40] <DaveMethvin> okay we should talk some more ... just tryna avoid another flag and perhaps we can
[09:36:51] <mikesherov> sure, I think we can too
[09:36:59] <mikesherov> I like to present the safest way first
[09:37:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah i agree
[09:37:25] <mikesherov> we can always take the easy / fast / smaller route if the safe route isn't desirable
[09:37:29] <DaveMethvin> just wondering if we are trying to preserve a behavior that wasn't consistent anyway
[09:37:39] <mikesherov> Oh, it definitely wasn't consistent
[09:37:46] <DaveMethvin> if so we can just document the behavior change and warn ppl
[09:37:50] <DaveMethvin> but everyone else gets faster loading
[09:37:57] <DaveMethvin> and everyone likes faster loading
[09:37:59] <mikesherov> sync loaded jQuery in modern browsers never waits for an IFRAME
[09:38:01] <sindresorhus_> we do
[09:38:08] <mikesherov> yes, that's optimal
[09:38:09] <DaveMethvin> except for people who wanted to diddle iframes
[09:38:14] <mikesherov> yes
[09:38:23] <mikesherov> and we can recommend $(window).load for them
[09:38:45] <mikesherov> actually, not really
[09:38:46] <DaveMethvin> "ask mikesherov if $(window).load is right for you"
[09:38:58] <mikesherov> because .load() might have already fired
[09:39:05] <DaveMethvin> right, hmmm
[09:39:35] <mikesherov> I mean, we can always make the default quickReady be true
[09:39:51] <mikesherov> and force you to say false if you want to preserve the behavior
[09:39:55] <mikesherov> that's why I made a flag
[09:40:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that would work too, and you're right that  you can't use window.load since it's a true event
[09:41:00] <DaveMethvin> ok so we do need quickReady but perhaps may want to flip the default
[09:41:00] <mikesherov> right
[09:41:05] <mikesherov> yup
[09:41:21] <mikesherov> depends if we want to turn on the bug tracker tractor beam
[09:41:29] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:41:33] <mikesherov> possibly*
[09:41:41] <sindresorhus_> doesn't people read the docs? :p
[09:41:46] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[09:41:48] <DaveMethvin> sindresorhus WAT
[09:41:57] <DaveMethvin> where have you been???
[09:42:10] <sindresorhus_> Yeah, I live in my own perfect unicorn world :)
[09:42:26] <DaveMethvin> if they can dream it, we are supposed to implement it
[09:42:28] <mikesherov> Dave, let me know what you'd like me to do, I'll modify the tests to accomodate
[09:42:42] <DaveMethvin> ok, i'll try to absorb all this
[09:42:56] <DaveMethvin> i have a pretty open week this week so i will try to get a lot of this done
[09:42:59] <mikesherov> read the tests, they should be good enough documentation of the behavior
[09:43:05] <DaveMethvin> next two weeks after that i'll be traveling
[09:43:17] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: the tests for quickReady explain current behavior
[09:43:26] <DaveMethvin> ok, thanks!
[09:43:29] <DaveMethvin> anything else?
[09:43:36] <mikesherov> let me know what you need, I'll help however I can
[09:44:27] <DaveMethvin> alright, thanks a lot everyone!
