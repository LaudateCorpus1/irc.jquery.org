[09:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: arschmitz gnarf kborchers mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:02:10] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:13] <kborchers> i'll be lurking but in other meetings unfortunately :(
[09:02:42] <fnagel> hey
[09:02:51] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to start with AMD/download builder?
[09:04:54] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:06:14] <rxaviers> I had no progress this week with AMD/download builder. I was waiting on team feedback on regard of AMDify tests. It seems it's a common sense that team prefers to AMDify the whole suite. Although, it seems like we wont implement that within the AMD PR
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: FYI never add comments to pbwiki edits.
[09:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> They seem like they should be helpful, but in reality they prevent pbwiki from sending a diff.
[09:06:56] <arschmitz> Ok sorry
[09:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry about it. Everyone does it once :-P
[09:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> It just feels like the right thing to do.
[09:07:48] <arschmitz> Yea had no idea and was just screaming commit message at me
[09:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with jzaefferer's comment to land what we have and add test changes later.
[09:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> As long as we've done manual testing, which I know we have.
[09:08:25] <tj_vantoll> Same here.
[09:09:05] <rxaviers> ok
[09:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, moving onto the next topic.
[09:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> Dylan's autocomplete a11y PR landed.
[09:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> And he should be looking at the datepicker rewrite soon.
[09:10:20] <rxaviers> So, I will squash the fixes on that branch, so it gets ready to be landed
[09:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sounds good. We should do one final review after that.
[09:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> But I think we're good to go.
[09:10:48] <rxaviers> ok
[09:11:23] <tj_vantoll> Do we want to add any documentation to the API docs for AMD?
[09:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I've actually wanted to write a more general doc about different environments. Let's sync up after the meeting.
[09:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to find my notes from forever ago.
[09:13:38] <rxaviers> can you guys put me on loop of this general doc about diff env too?
[09:14:01] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good. I think we should have *something*, and I'm up for writing it.
[09:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sure. We'll have the discussion in -dev or Skype. Anyone that wants to join can join.
[09:15:22] <rxaviers> ok
[09:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything to discuss for button?
[09:15:43] <tj_vantoll> ok
[09:16:08] <arschmitz> not really mostly just porting the google doc to wiki
[09:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> Back to autocomplete :-P
[09:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> I built an extension showing that the rare case of disabled items can be handled via an extension.
[09:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> So that ticket was closed and we won't be changing anything in our code.
[09:17:07] <tj_vantoll> :thumbs up:
[09:17:17] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Any selectmenu updates?
[09:17:23] <scott_gonzalez> I know we need to track down the IE7 width bug.
[09:17:28] <scott_gonzalez> That one sure is strange.
[09:17:54] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: no, i will work on this today. Problem is usage of outerWidth as a setter
[09:18:42] <fnagel> It works in "real world" just the test setting is failing. I will try to inject a style tag in order to change the native select width
[09:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Yeah, I'll dig into that. It sounds like a bug in core.
[09:19:15] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Do you need some more information? Did you notice my comment in Wiki?
[09:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I saw your comment. I think you provided enough info.
[09:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> We actually have a decrease in tickets AND pull requests this week. Pretty big dip in PRs actually.
[09:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> Down from 49 to 37 :-)
[09:20:35] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: ok, no other updates for selectmenu. I still need to find some time to take a look at Alex comments reagrding mobile issues
[09:20:43] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I see that you were busy this morning :P
[09:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, getting ready for 1.10.4.
[09:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> All the regressions introduced in 1.10.0 are fixed now.
[09:21:21] <jzaefferer> fnagel: it looks like selectmenu is somewhat consistently failing tests against jQuery Core 1.7, e.g. http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2341 not super important, but would be good to address as well
[09:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Any update for CLDR?
[09:22:45] <rxaviers> I'm working on https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/196 this weekk
[09:23:20] <rxaviers> I'll probably need some CLDR support on a few questions, also considering some data inclusion. But, so far so good.
[09:23:26] <rxaviers> No updates other than that.
[09:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> This is just for parsing and formatting exact dates, right?
[09:23:55] <rxaviers> correct
[09:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> And then moment will build on top of that, adding in the date math.
[09:24:19] <rxaviers> exactly
[09:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Any update on datepicker?
[09:25:09] <rxaviers> more precisely, Im implementing the "zone" row of http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table
[09:25:28] <tj_vantoll> Just minor stuff, nothing specific to note.
[09:25:33] <tj_vantoll> Datepicker ^
[09:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov will be working on draggable tests.
[09:26:25] <jzaefferer> Anyone who wants to help test commitplease, just `npm install commitplease` on any repo where you do comits: https://github.com/jzaefferer/commitplease
[09:26:28] <fnagel> jzaefferer: seems the failing test (and even the wrong value) is the same like the one in IE7, so its probably related to outerWidth, too
[09:27:08] <jzaefferer> fnagel: that's interesting, since jQuery Core 1.7 doesn't include outerWidth as a setter, so the bug seems to be in our implementation (in jquery.ui.core.js)
[09:29:04] <fnagel> jzaefferer: core 1.7 doesn have outerWidth implemented but UI does?
[09:29:27] <jzaefferer> yes
[09:29:34] <jzaefferer> We polyfill it for Core <1.8
[09:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll's PR for touch action support is just waiting on feedback from George Stephanis.
[09:29:46] <jzaefferer> The polyfill existed before it was added in Core
[09:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:34:26] <tj_vantoll> Any concrete plans for 1.10.4?
[09:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be part of the string of announcements during the week.
[09:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> Just need to coordinate with Dave to figure out which day.
[09:35:51] <fnagel> What about the line ending issue? ;-)
[09:35:54] <tj_vantoll> Which string of announcements?
[09:36:33] <scott_gonzalez> We do a series of posts and releases in January for jQuery's birthday.
[09:36:49] <tj_vantoll> ah ok
[09:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> Monday was The State of jQuery, yesterday was the CDN post
[09:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's continue any other discussions in -dev.
[09:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look for my notes about various environemnts. I think I was smart enough to create an issue for it.
