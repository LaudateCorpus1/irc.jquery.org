[08:57:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer arschmitz gnarf kborchers mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll
[08:57:54] <rxaviers> hey
[08:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> Meeting in 3 minutes.
[08:57:57] <kborchers> yo
[08:57:58] <mikesherov> weeee
[08:58:20] <tj_vantoll> yoooooo
[08:58:23] <mikesherov> I just finally finished my bullet proofing of the draggable test suite
[08:58:23] <arschmitz> hi
[08:58:36] <mikesherov> and by bullet proofing, I mean, tests the things it says it tests
[08:58:51] <mikesherov> I can finally fix the bugs I've caused
[08:58:54] * kborchers pulls mikesherov's draggable test suite and polishes his gun
[09:00:04] <mikesherov> ?
[09:01:05] <kborchers> mikesherov: bad joke is bad
[09:01:11] <mikesherov> oh word
[09:01:33] <scott_gonzalez> YAY
[09:01:48] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: sounds good, but draggable is not on the agenda :p
[09:01:55] <mikesherov> oh shucks
[09:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> It *can* be on the agenda :-P
[09:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> I sent the "globals" PR this morning.
[09:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's good to land.
[09:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'll make some style updates for code that got touched.
[09:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> And land that after the meeting, unless anyone still wanted to review but didn't get a chance.
[09:03:50] <jzaefferer> me
[09:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Is there anything else holding up AMD or was that the last thing?
[09:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll wait for jzaefferer to review before landing in master.
[09:05:00] <rxaviers> Well, you have made a list on the AMD PR. I think there are still open items to be done, like css stuff
[09:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right.
[09:05:34] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029/
[09:05:34] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (3mon 1w ago): AMD support
[09:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> I can do the file renames and splitting of core once the globals PR lands.
[09:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> And copy the i18n files.
[09:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> So we need to figure out CSS.
[09:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know what we should be doing here?
[09:07:04] <rxaviers> Yeap, I guess we can use AMD plugins for that, just like I do here with json data: (finding link...)
[09:07:23] <rxaviers> (for that = Handle CSS dependencies)
[09:07:44] <jzaefferer> We can check what Mobile does and do the opposite
[09:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:07:51] <jzaefferer> or ask what arschmitz would do if done right ;)
[09:07:54] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/CLDR/test/spec/datetime/format.js#L3
[09:08:04] <rxaviers> lol
[09:08:14] <arschmitz> lol
[09:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you look into how this will work with the build?
[09:08:42] <rxaviers> sure
[09:09:11] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: download builder seems to run well now, anything unusual?
[09:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll also ping some people on that PR to see if we can get some input from the community as well.
[09:09:28] <arschmitz> as far as css
[09:09:30] <rxaviers> arschmitz, have you done anything like that in mobile?
[09:09:58] <arschmitz> there are plugins for this but they are all unreliable or have issues when used with actual require because of load issues
[09:10:11] <arschmitz> but for the build they could probably work
[09:10:52] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, yeap, I havent heard any complains so far. It seems the fixes solved the two issues from prev weeks.
[09:11:13] <arschmitz> mobile only supports it for the build and we use pragmas that are custom parsed
[09:11:22] <rxaviers> ok
[09:11:25] <arschmitz> i would not recommend that
[09:11:50] <rxaviers> basically, we want the respective .JS file to let builder know which CSS it should include, right?
[09:12:20] <rxaviers> (by using any AMD thing to define that)
[09:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:12:22] <rxaviers> ok
[09:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> But we also need to determine if we should be exposing this in the define() for distributed files.
[09:13:03] <arschmitz> yeah thats harder
[09:13:12] <arschmitz> because there are plugins to use that sort of thing
[09:13:20] <arschmitz> but they all are buggy
[09:14:46] <jzaefferer> Can we ignore that problem for now and get back to it when there's a solution that jburke supports?
[09:15:04] <jzaefferer> as with the order plugin getting replaced with the shim configuration
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose that's a question for rxaviers.
[09:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> The build needs to handle this without any hard-coded settings.
[09:15:42] <jzaefferer> Can we assume 1:1 mappings from JS to CSS files?
[09:16:44] <jzaefferer> Let's see what the AMD community has to say
[09:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> With the exception of core and theme, yes.
[09:16:49] <jzaefferer> I can only guess
[09:17:13] <arschmitz> dont think its quite that clearcut in mobile but not far from
[09:17:38] <jzaefferer> thanks scott_gonzalez for fixing my typos
[09:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> no problem :-)
[09:17:49] <jzaefferer> aka brainfarts
[09:18:00] <jzaefferer> how did I write complaints?
[09:18:46] <rxaviers> (sorry for the absense, I was checking DB files)
[09:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> "complains"
[09:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> We got our first PR from the a11y summit.
[09:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1117
[09:19:20] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1117 by dylanb (3h 20m ago): Tooltip: Add tooltip content to an aria-live div when the tooltip conten...
[09:19:27] <jzaefferer> this one looks much more reasonable
[09:19:49] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: since you've been testing the tooltip ajax issue, could you verify his new PR works as intended?
[09:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should probably just create the instance at create though.
[09:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> One per instance.
[09:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> Just like autocomplete.
[09:20:17] <arschmitz> yeah this was the one we though was most likely to generate an actual PR
[09:20:44] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, about the css let me research some stuff first and I get back to you guys
[09:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise this will just grow and grow.
[09:20:53] <jzaefferer> store as this.liveRegion, as in autocomplete?
[09:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sounds good.
[09:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yeah
[09:21:13] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I agree on the one per instance.
[09:21:17] <jzaefferer> makes sense
[09:21:21] <jzaefferer> will you comment on the PR?
[09:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, doing that now.
[09:21:42] <tj_vantoll> Once that change is made I'll do the verification.
[09:21:53] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: anything on button?
[09:22:11] <arschmitz> yes been finishing the css only layer
[09:22:17] <arschmitz> have it working with icons
[09:22:32] <arschmitz> but its kinda weird with the current ui implementation of icons
[09:22:35] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: anything we can look at?
[09:23:04] <arschmitz> no i have not pushed a branch yet just got access this morning
[09:23:10] <arschmitz> :)
[09:23:24] <jzaefferer> use the fork, luke!
[09:23:34] <tj_vantoll> nice
[09:23:47] <fnagel> LOL
[09:23:51] <arschmitz> yeah i was getting ready to this morning but scott_gonzalez gave me access
[09:23:57] <arschmitz> to just make a branch
[09:24:09] <jzaefferer> makes sense
[09:24:12] <arschmitz> anyway i want to try to cleanup how icons are working
[09:25:06] <arschmitz> then have everyone take a look at the css only layer and see what you all thing before moving on to the JS
[09:25:22] <jzaefferer> can you do a review-PR? Regular PR, but intended for reviewing, no merging yet
[09:25:37] <arschmitz> yeah of course
[09:26:04] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:27:31] <jzaefferer> There's an oldish commit that kills the dialog testsuite in IE8. An recent change from me has failing assetions in the same browser. My dialog PR also has issues there.
[09:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you want to discuss dialog or just let people know that we need to fix the test suite?
[09:27:38] <jzaefferer> I could use some help debugging those
[09:27:49] <jzaefferer> Not much to discuss I guess
[09:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok. If it's still failing after I finish looking into selectmenu, I'll check it out.
[09:28:13] <jzaefferer> Looks like tj_vantoll closed a few more issues as duplicates of the z-index shuffling one, so seems like the fix itself is still good
[09:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> I started going through the wiki comments.
[09:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> Cleaning up the ones that are already dealt with.
[09:28:47] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I tested it out. Works perfectly.
[09:28:50] <fnagel> souds giid
[09:28:53] <fnagel> good
[09:28:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, speaking of...
[09:29:29] <jzaefferer> selectmenu?
[09:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> Does everyone agree with this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9616#comment:1
[09:30:24] <kborchers> i agree
[09:30:43] <arschmitz> yeah makes sense to me i agree
[09:31:15] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is dialogClass really compatible with "scoped themes"? There is no child element for ".scope .ui-dialog" when appending to body
[09:31:32] <jzaefferer> we probably discussed this before, but I can't remember the answer
[09:31:54] <fnagel> jfeafferer: this is a poblem in a few widgets. Remember me fighting for the wrapper div?
[09:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, we don't do the .scope.ui-dialog chaining?
[09:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/145
[09:33:25] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #145 by thomich (5mon 1w ago): JQuery-UI Theme with defined css scope won't work
[09:33:26] <fnagel> I think one need the wrapping div by using widget methid
[09:35:47] <jzaefferer> So we need to fix the download builder before we can tell people that they're doing it wrong?
[09:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[09:36:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: could you comment on this? How does the 1.4 theme deal with this?
[09:37:22] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: you mean how we deal with swatches basicly?
[09:37:28] <arschmitz> and inheritance from them
[09:38:20] <jzaefferer> yeah, whatever is closest to "scope themes" in UI
[09:38:38] <jzaefferer> *scoped
[09:38:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are you around?
[09:38:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is the better person for this since he wrote the 1.4 theme
[09:39:54] <jzaefferer> maybe something to discuss in Amsterdam, if we don't get to it before that
[09:40:15] <arschmitz> yeah i think i know but he knows much better so id rather let me answer this
[09:40:40] <arschmitz> *him answer
[09:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I'm not seeing any styling at all for http://jsfiddle.net/TRe2y/1/
[09:43:09] <jzaefferer> yeah, me neither
[09:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's the site he's linking to. It doesn't serve the file.
[09:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> It http://jsfiddle.net/TRe2y/2/
[09:45:26] <fnagel> scott's fiddle works for me
[09:46:42] <jzaefferer> fnagel: You're still looking for feedback on the widths-options, right? Is there anything else?
[09:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> Here it is actually reduced: http://jsfiddle.net/TRe2y/3/
[09:47:18] <fnagel> jzaefferer: yes, feedback for with and some open questions in wiki Im not able to answer on my own
[09:47:29] <arschmitz> fnagel: i looked at the width this morning
[09:47:51] <arschmitz> it addressed everything width related i could see for mobile or in general
[09:48:15] <fnagel> arschmitz: pleae notice the comment thread from TJ
[09:48:40] <arschmitz> i did sorry should have been more specific
[09:48:50] <arschmitz> your fiddle you posted as a suggestion in reply
[09:50:41] <arschmitz> is what i thought addressed everything and it also simplifies to two one option
[09:52:12] <jzaefferer> I think we made some good progress on PRs. Thanks tj_vantoll!
[09:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, good to see a 15% drop :-)
[09:52:32] <jzaefferer> also for tj_vantoll: did you test Scott's grunt-jquery-content updates? Can we deploy "return values"?
[09:53:09] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: did get get a chance to look at the classes option?
[09:53:15] <arschmitz> i did
[09:53:41] <arschmitz> it makes most widgets work without any custom css or js in mobile
[09:53:52] <fnagel> arschmitz: I ve lost the focus: which answer and which fiddle? Or not related to selectmenu?
[09:54:15] <arschmitz> however i ran into a few places where the element i would want to apply a class to does not get a class normally so classes option did not help
[09:54:25] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: I have not. scott_gonzalez: grunt-jquery-content just needs to be tagged, correct?
[09:54:34] <arschmitz> fnagel: http://jsfiddle.net/qeeSC/4/ you posted it in response to tj_vantoll comment
[09:54:49] <arschmitz> fnagel: on selectmenu
[09:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: It's tagged.
[09:55:22] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: the classes option is this something that would still be considdered if it were not for mobile?
[09:55:26] <uGoMobi> I am here now
[09:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yes.
[09:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> The ticket is very old.
[09:56:09] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7053
[09:56:11] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Ok I'll update api.jqueryui.com.
[09:56:21] <arschmitz> ok just wanted to make sure because this would be a temp thing for mobile so would not be worth adding just for that
[09:56:24] <fnagel> arschmitz: "simplifies to two one option" ? Did you see TJs answer below (not an dirkt reply)?
[09:56:46] <fnagel> TJ said: 1) A "width" option that controls the button width and we document how to control the menu width with CSS.
[09:56:46] <fnagel> 2) "buttonWidth" and "menuWidth" options as they're currently implemented.
[09:57:32] <fnagel> sorry, new keyboard, should read (not a direct reply)
[09:57:48] <arschmitz> yes i like option 1
[09:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer 1
[09:58:14] <tj_vantoll> I'm also a #1 supporter.
[09:58:34] <kborchers> #1
[09:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh good, now I don't need to comment on that on the wiki :-P
[09:58:59] <fnagel> So, I would remove widthMenu, which is set to auto by default (longest option) and could be set by CSS. width option controls button width as currently implemented. Right?
[09:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: You should look at autocomplete.
[09:59:41] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: I use autocomplete behaviour like in autocomplete for menu width
[09:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok, perfect
[10:00:12] <fnagel> Ok, will push this soon. I will remove all width comments written by Scott
[10:00:17] <jzaefferer> fnagel: are there other questions?
[10:00:29] <fnagel> Any comment onhttp://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu#cr1382044916
[10:00:31] <jzaefferer> line height?
[10:00:32] <fnagel> ys
[10:00:36] <fnagel> yes
[10:00:59] <fnagel> and http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu#cr1380051842
[10:02:54] <fnagel> and finally: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu#cr1379906016
[10:03:24] <arschmitz> i agree that the original one looks a little too much like its own option but i think your updated one looks fine
[10:03:32] <arschmitz> for the line height issue
[10:04:02] <fnagel> Which means adding some top / bottom margin to the list items (li)
[10:04:07] <fnagel> Agree
[10:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted to modify the menu CSS anyway.
[10:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> But for now, I think we're ok with what you've proposed in that fiddle.
[10:05:28] <fnagel> Only specific for selectmenu or menu in general?
[10:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> menu in general
[10:06:40] <tj_vantoll> "plugin only" is live now http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-close
[10:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:07:13] <fnagel> Ok, I wikl fix this in master branch
[10:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..was that font always used for the return value?
[10:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> Or did I break something recently?
[10:08:44] <tj_vantoll> You mean the italics?
[10:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> The quagmire font.
[10:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess that's actually Klavika.
[10:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> I probably just don't remember.
[10:11:16] <tj_vantoll> It looks fine to me.
[10:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> Good. As long as I didn't break it :-P
[10:13:43] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: any news on CLDR?
[10:13:48] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: any news on effects rewrite?
[10:13:53] <rxaviers> no news on CLDR sir
[10:14:09] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: no news yet
[10:14:14] <tj_vantoll> Only other thing I wanted to bring up is I completed my datepicker options/methods docs for the rewrite http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker.
[10:14:15] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: I've seen your edits on the datepicker wiki, what's next for you?
[10:14:22] <tj_vantoll> Good timing :)
[10:14:38] <tj_vantoll> We need to finalize datepicker's API.
[10:14:50] <tj_vantoll> Then I'll work on implementing it.
[10:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's schedule a call to go over the notes on the wiki.
[10:15:25] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: can you do the rip-jQuery-out-of $.date and fixing multi month, while arschmitz reviews the rewrite so far?
[10:15:35] <jzaefferer> then we can do the call
[10:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can discuss in Amsterdam if we don't finish the review before then.
[10:16:18] <tj_vantoll> Rip jQuery out of $.date?
[10:16:29] <tj_vantoll> I can clean up multi month sure.
[10:16:56] <jzaefferer> yeah, there's no good reason $.date is within the jQuery namespace
[10:17:18] <tj_vantoll> So $.ui.date?
[10:17:26] <tj_vantoll> Where should it live?
[10:17:43] <jzaefferer> I mean, this utility, like Globalize, should have no dependency on jQuery
[10:17:58] <tj_vantoll> ooooooh
[10:18:15] <jzaefferer> "Update $.date to remove the jQuery dependency."
[10:18:34] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I can do that. It'll need to be a global then correct?
[10:18:50] <jzaefferer> I'd rather include augmentjs to use Array.prototype.forEach or map then abusing jQuery for that
[10:19:06] <jzaefferer> yeah, we have to come up with a name
[10:19:19] <jzaefferer> maybe something with "calendar", since that's really what its all about
[10:20:10] <tj_vantoll> Naming it will be harder than removing jQuery :)
[10:20:28] <jzaefferer> JCalendar
[10:20:30] <jzaefferer> :p
[10:20:47] <jzaefferer> QDate
[10:20:53] <jzaefferer> Qulendar
[10:21:08] <tj_vantoll> DATE
[10:21:08] <fnagel> does it handle dates only? or time too?
[10:21:18] <tj_vantoll> Dates only.
[10:21:36] <jzaefferer> for time you just use Globalize
[10:21:55] <jzaefferer> this tool builds calendar related stuff on top of Globalize
[10:22:02] <fnagel> should these two functionalities stay at the same location aka Globalize?
[10:22:27] <jzaefferer> well, since Globalize is becoming more modular anyway, that seems reasonable
[10:22:34] <fnagel> its about formatting date and time, PHP handles this in DateTime object
[10:22:39] <jzaefferer> if someone only needs number formatting, they can skip everything else...
[10:23:06] <jzaefferer> fnagel: probably the most important method in $.date (as its called right now) is "days", which returns an array of weeks, which contains arrays of days
[10:23:09] <jzaefferer> to actually render a calendar
[10:23:43] <jzaefferer> but there's a bunch of related methods
[10:23:59] <fnagel> I'm not aware how Globalize is structured but it seems logical to date and time bundled. Dependencies should be a different concern in my opinion.
[10:24:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: any thoughts on making "$.date" a module in Globalize?
[10:25:24] <jzaefferer> or scott_gonzalez?
[10:25:26] <rxaviers> $.date is Globalize limited by date functions only?
[10:25:51] <jzaefferer> no
[10:25:57] <jzaefferer> nevermind, let's discuss this some other time
[10:26:05] <jzaefferer> I have some docs on $.date somewhere, I'll share those
[10:26:27] <rxaviers> ok, please just let me know.
[10:26:56] <jzaefferer> I think we're done here. Scott is probably off to lunch already or something :-)
[10:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> hehe
[10:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> I ate right before the meeting started :-)
[10:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's continue in -dev.
[10:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
