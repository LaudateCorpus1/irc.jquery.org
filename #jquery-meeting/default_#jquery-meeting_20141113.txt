[11:01:35] <arschmitz> gseguin: agcolom: jasperdegroot: cgack: sfrisk: Meeting Time!
[11:01:52] <sfrisk> allo
[11:01:56] <cgack> howdy!
[11:02:02] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:02:38] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:04:11] <arschmitz> Agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=53
[11:05:04] <arschmitz> Ok lets get started
[11:05:37] <arschmitz> there is a kinda big perf regression between 1.4.3 and 1.4.4
[11:05:48] <arschmitz> we will need to look into this for 1.5
[11:06:13] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7839
[11:07:03] <arschmitz> i looked quickly and didnt see anything that stuck out as a potential cause
[11:07:25] <jasperdegroot> did you try with another widget?
[11:07:51] <jasperdegroot> I mean, do you know if it is a popup specific problem
[11:07:53] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i have not looked into it
[11:08:03] <arschmitz> They seem to think it is but hard to tell
[11:08:32] <arschmitz> their test pages are pretty convoluted
[11:08:49] <arschmitz> but there is a noticable difference in load time between versions
[11:09:05] <jasperdegroot> yeah, saw that
[11:10:33] <arschmitz> ok so 1.5
[11:10:46] <arschmitz> classes is about to land in UI so that part of things will be solid
[11:10:56] <arschmitz> i implemented the automatic destroy
[11:11:01] <arschmitz> and we wont be doing this though
[11:11:12] <arschmitz> it only saved like 9 lines of code in the entire ui library
[11:11:18] <arschmitz> and added significant complication
[11:11:30] <arschmitz> to the base factory
[11:12:30] <arschmitz> Gabriel has asked cgack to take over the test fix branch
[11:12:33] <arschmitz> and ill be helping him
[11:13:02] <cgack> yepper, I'm just getting into it now, seems like he has a great deal of the work done
[11:13:22] <arschmitz> yeah he had been working on it for a bit
[11:13:47] <arschmitz> cgack also updated the navbar review pr
[11:14:16] <cgack> yes, that branch is a fresh as it can be (though I haven't added Classes option to it yet)
[11:14:32] <arschmitz> cgack: you wont
[11:14:39] <arschmitz> cgack: that is just to get passing tests as is
[11:14:46] <arschmitz> then that will land on ui-1-12
[11:14:57] <arschmitz> and the classes prs will go against ui-1-12
[11:15:04] <arschmitz> or already are
[11:15:46] <cgack> okay, i was confused with: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7705
[11:17:04] <arschmitz> cgack: sorry more or less unrelated
[11:17:23] <arschmitz> but on that issue
[11:17:35] <arschmitz> you should incorperate the classes update into the review
[11:18:14] * cgack is now more confused
[11:18:19] <arschmitz> lol
[11:18:28] <arschmitz> cgack: ok what part are you confused about?
[11:19:00] <cgack> do i implement the classes option on the navbar-review branch or not?
[11:19:36] <arschmitz> yes
[11:20:08] <arschmitz> it should all be one r
[11:20:09] <arschmitz> pr
[11:21:20] <cgack> okay. I think I understand - I'll ask outside of the meeting if I have any other questions about it
[11:21:28] <arschmitz> sure
[11:21:42] <arschmitz> ok jasperdegroot you continued on the css updates for buttons?
[11:21:52] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:22:06] <jasperdegroot> I hope to make some more progress this weekend
[11:22:20] <jasperdegroot> to have at least the CSS ready
[11:22:25] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok perfect
[11:22:40] <arschmitz> it will be hard to review other classes prs with out that
[11:22:55] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:23:08] <arschmitz> so many widgets use some part of buttons or checkboxradio
[11:23:21] <arschmitz> ok accordion
[11:23:37] <arschmitz> no the issue has been updated with a pretty good checklist
[11:23:45] <arschmitz> sfrisk: will be working on this soon
[11:23:48] <sfrisk> yes
[11:23:50] <sfrisk> that is the plan
[11:24:14] <arschmitz> i think thats it for new 1.5 stuff this week unless someone else has something?
[11:24:28] <agcolom> I do, but not for 1.5
[11:24:50] <arschmitz> yeah theres a lot more :)
[11:25:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: is it something already on the agenda?
[11:25:12] <agcolom> yep
[11:25:16] <arschmitz> ok
[11:25:30] <arschmitz> lets just go in order unless you need to leave
[11:25:41] <agcolom> I'm good for another 20min

[11:31:22] <arschmitz> this is blocking a lot of other issues

[11:33:27] <arschmitz> so we have real rules for CSS now http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/css/
[11:33:56] <arschmitz> in prep for the framework we are also working on updating the html style guide
