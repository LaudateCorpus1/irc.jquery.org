[12:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> Forgot which meeting we were having :-P
[12:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> We've had a few bug reports come in.
[12:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> Most of them look like regressions.
[12:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> I've been really busy this past week, so I haven't had time to look into them. But I should have time before the next meeting.
[12:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get everything resolved and then do another release.
[12:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did you get a chance to look into the datepicker bug on iOS 10? https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15050
[12:05:18] <arschmitz> hi
[12:05:31] <arschmitz> no with everything at work i didnt even look at ui
[12:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: What's the status of the datepicker PR? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1755
[12:08:49] <fnagel> hey
[12:09:18] <fnagel> almost ready
[12:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> I saw today that it slipped toward the bottom of my inbox, so I was late in responding to your question.
[12:09:27] <fnagel> blocker: travis / tinezone
[12:09:35] <fnagel> * timezone
[12:10:50] <fnagel> We need a decision on this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1755#discussion_r81809153
[12:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> I like the idea of just doing the manual parsing by splitting on dashes.
[12:11:43] <fnagel> I'm fine with that too
[12:13:29] <fnagel> So its: changing the parsing, change for resetting the min / max  and fixing the travis / timezone issues.
[12:13:49] <fnagel> Not sure if we might want to handle the travis one in a seperate PR
[12:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with that.
[12:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> Just gotta figure that out before we merge to master.
[12:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's all I had on the agenda.
[12:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Just want to get through any new tickets so we can release.
[12:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:16:17] <fnagel> It's already been added to the wiki todo list
[12:17:51] <fnagel> Anyway, I feel better with working travis tests. Would be nice if somebody could take a look and give me some adivise how to handle this
[12:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll need to figure out what we can do here.
[12:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure we can get this addressed soon.
[12:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
