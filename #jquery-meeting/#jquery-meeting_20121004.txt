[11:00:15] <toddmparker_> Hi all
[11:00:21] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:00:27] <toddmparker_> the jQuery Mobile meeting is starting up
[11:00:34] <toddmparker_> chime in if you're here
[11:00:42] <gseguin> hiya
[11:00:42] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:01:52] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:59] <toddmparker_> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQJ2stndkz5HC5t85CgW-6x6QLcfltrbofLl97jiKuI/edit#
[11:03:07] <toddmparker_> so the team is preparing for the DC session now
[11:03:27] <toddmparker_> we'll do a follow up after this to discuss goals/table assignments
[11:03:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Like, A/V?
[11:03:42] <toddmparker_> anyone lurking here that will be an attendee?
[11:03:47] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: prolly
[11:03:53] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:04:05] <toddmparker_> (silence)
[11:04:15] <_|Nix|_> *cricket* ... *cricket*
[11:04:16] <toddmparker_> oh, well. looking forward to meeting the volunteers
[11:04:35] <toddmparker_> next, There will be another maintenance release for 1.1 (1.1.2) in the coming weeks.
[11:05:05] <toddmparker_> Timing TBD - we want to look at some fixed toolbar issues in DC if we can and get those in
[11:05:09] <JasonDScott_> Hi
[11:05:19] <toddmparker_> hi JasonDScott_
[11:05:22] <toddmparker_> Roadmap draft for the next year close to complete: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Roadmap
[11:05:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Looking promising.
[11:05:44] <toddmparker_> we'll be refining this a lot as we go, but it maps out the general direction
[11:06:41] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:06:49] <toddmparker_> Plans for UI integration/harmonization are in full swing for the next few months - 1.3 will tackle basic conflicts, 1.4 will include a new tab widget from UI
[11:07:02] <toddmparker_> that will provide a template for how other widgets will merge
[11:07:22] <toddmparker_> some planning on this will happen in DC on Wednesday
[11:07:26] <toddmparker_> that's it for me...
[11:07:49] <_|Nix|_> Me?
[11:07:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: does that mean we don't continue with the tabview PR from @fequent?
[11:08:00] <toddmparker_> I'll paste in johnbender's updates in a sec
[11:08:15] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: no, that is still on deck for 1.3
[11:08:21] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:08:39] <toddmparker_> for 1.3, we're going to be doing some analysis on CSS framework merging/conflicts, etc.
[11:08:56] <toddmparker_> tabs in 1.4 will be the first new widget based on this work
[11:09:01] <toddmparker_> so for johnbender
[11:09:03] <toddmparker_> Branches to merge next week
[11:09:03] <toddmparker_> slider events to _on
[11:09:03] <toddmparker_> disable base tag management https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4456
[11:09:16] <toddmparker_> First pass at query param support in the hash
[11:09:16] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5085#issuecomment-9045132
[11:09:16] <toddmparker_> merge next week
[11:09:31] <toddmparker_> Nav refactor
[11:09:32] <toddmparker_> two event based approaches so far simple/full hash management
[11:09:32] <toddmparker_> will require discussion
[11:09:32] <toddmparker_> normalizing hashchange/popstate as navigate event
[11:09:32] <toddmparker_> attempting to do forward/back events with history tracking
[11:09:33] <toddmparker_> lots of considerations
[11:09:33] <toddmparker_> difficult without conventions/expectations
[11:09:48] <toddmparker_> (formatting is better in the doc)
[11:09:55] <toddmparker_> so the nav work is well underway for 1.3
[11:11:11] <toddmparker_> who wants to go next with an update?
[11:11:29] <gseguin> mine will be quick
[11:11:34] <toddmparker_> k
[11:11:46] <gseguin> The download builder now supports semver tagging
[11:12:11] <gseguin> which means when you push a semver tag it will automatically check out a workspace for that tag
[11:12:35] <gseguin> which means you only have to update the front-end manually from now on
[11:12:50] <toddmparker_> great news!
[11:13:08] <gseguin> Hoping I can spend some time today to plan for DC and start looking at what I can do for 1.3
[11:13:15] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:13:17] <gseguin> that's it
[11:13:33] <toddmparker_> think there are a lot of smaller features in the roadmap you could chip away at
[11:13:47] <gseguin> sounds good to me
[11:13:47] <toddmparker_> clear buttons for inputs, close button position for dialogs, etc.
[11:14:01] <toddmparker_> feel free to assign yourself to ones you want
[11:14:06] <gseguin> k
[11:14:09] <toddmparker_> ok, who's next?
[11:14:15] <_|Nix|_> I can go.
[11:14:52] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:14:53] <_|Nix|_> I've fixed a bunch of bugs, added the sequence tests, and I'm now fighting with the buttonMarkup, which I wouldn't mind talking a bout.
[11:15:24] <toddmparker_> let's keep this to a rundown so we have time for DC planning if that's ok
[11:15:35] <_|Nix|_> OK. WORKSFORME.
[11:15:45] <_|Nix|_> So, that's it, I guess.
[11:16:29] <toddmparker_> Ijust assigned this to you for 1.3 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4961
[11:16:52] <_|Nix|_> Right, that one.
[11:17:02] <toddmparker_> to recap all the stuff _|Nix|_ did this week:
[11:17:03] <toddmparker_> Fixed popup issue #5118 (page1 -> dialog -> popup -> page2 <- back)
[11:17:03] <toddmparker_> Added navigation sequence tests
[11:17:03] <toddmparker_> Fixed #4984 (re-introduce $.mobile._registerInternalEvents)
[11:17:04] <toddmparker_> Fixed #5104 (making sure loader event handlers are always called with the loader as “this”)
[11:17:04] <toddmparker_> Cleaned up popup
[11:17:05] <toddmparker_> Moved some of the inline functions to widget level
[11:17:05] <toddmparker_> Got rid of “self” wherever possible
[11:17:06] <toddmparker_> Fixed #5123 (when destroying a popup, do not emit “popupafterclose” if the popup is closed)
[11:17:08] <_|Nix|_> Should be easy. (Famous Last Words
[11:17:13] <toddmparker_> heh.
[11:17:16] <_|Nix|_> ™)
[11:17:21] <_|Nix|_> St00pid keyboard.
[11:17:29] <toddmparker_> hardest part will be to pick a name for the option
[11:17:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah.
[11:17:59] <_|Nix|_> preventClose?
[11:18:03] <toddmparker_> we'll definitely cover the button stuff in dev
[11:18:10] <_|Nix|_> closeOnClick?
[11:18:21] <toddmparker_> better
[11:18:23] <_|Nix|_> clickScreenToClose?
[11:18:28] <toddmparker_> better
[11:18:37] <_|Nix|_> Kinda long.
[11:18:48] <agcolom> what is the option doing?
[11:18:52] <toddmparker_> ScreenCloses?
[11:19:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It decides whether clicking on the screen will cause the popup to close.
[11:19:20] <toddmparker_> whether clicking out on the overlay (or outside the popup in general) closes the popup
[11:19:24] <toddmparker_> true by default
[11:19:28] <agcolom> ok....
[11:19:31] <agcolom> thiking....
[11:19:39] <agcolom> thinking!^
[11:20:02] <agcolom> shouldClose?
[11:20:04] <_|Nix|_> screenClickCloses ...
[11:20:21] <_|Nix|_> That's slightly shorter.
[11:20:25] <agcolom> ForceClose
[11:20:35] <_|Nix|_> Let's decide later.
[11:20:40] <agcolom> yeah!
[11:20:50] <uGoMobi> I think we need another hour for this :)
[11:20:52] <_|Nix|_> If I push a change with a given option name, we can always change it before the release.
[11:20:59] <toddmparker_> yeah, hard to name it
[11:21:35] <agcolom> ordinaryClose?
[11:21:49] <toddmparker_> commented on the ticket
[11:21:51] <toddmparker_>  This will be a boolean option that defaults to true. We need to work out a clear option name for this since clickOverlayToClosePopup is a wee bit long.
[11:21:55] <_|Nix|_> The funny thing is, preventing close in that fashion isn't really powerful.
[11:21:58] <toddmparker_> pile on!
[11:22:18] <uGoMobi> btnCloseOnly
[11:22:20] <_|Nix|_> You can still tab-navigate behind it.
[11:22:25] <toddmparker_> well, if you disable back button too
[11:22:33] <_|Nix|_> It only gives the illusion of modality.
[11:22:36] <uGoMobi> right
[11:22:39] <toddmparker_> we should manage focus to keep it in a popup
[11:22:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: That's really hard, because it doesn't tell you where focus goes.
[11:22:57] <toddmparker_> let's add an issue for that
[11:23:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I've already tried.
[11:23:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Impossibru!
[11:23:17] <toddmparker_> ui does it for their dialog
[11:23:31] <toddmparker_> but we can give it a look offline
[11:23:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Not cleanly though, I bet.
[11:24:02] <toddmparker_> it involves setting tabindex I think
[11:24:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It looked ugly, because the focus has to briefly go wherever it wants to, including some totally different part of the page, resulting in scrolling.
[11:24:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Then, it jumps back to the popup, so it scrolls back again.
[11:24:42] <_|Nix|_> "Jarring"
[11:24:45] <toddmparker_> mind making a ticket and we can add a few approaches to look at?
[11:24:51] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's no good
[11:24:51] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:25:42] <toddmparker_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11351983/how-to-limit-tab-indexes-to-just-an-overlay-and-its-elements
[11:26:25] <_|Nix|_> Alright ... I'll give it a shot.
[11:26:49] <toddmparker_> related: we do bounce focus to the first focusable item in a popup, right?
[11:27:01] <toddmparker_> if not, that needs to go in the ticket
[11:27:06] <toddmparker_> think we so tho
[11:27:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: No.
[11:27:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We pass focus to the popup container, not the first focusable item.
[11:27:29] <toddmparker_> well, that works
[11:27:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: People can focus whatever they want upon popupafteropen.
[11:27:40] <toddmparker_> just as long as we shift focus there
[11:28:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We do, but we cannot know what sorts of wonderous mysterious things people decide to place in a popup.
[11:28:28] <toddmparker_> that's fine. what we do now seems to work fine
[11:28:35] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[11:28:40] <toddmparker_> if i hit tab the browser jumps to the next focusable thing
[11:28:55] <toddmparker_> the issues is just that once i get to the last item in a popup, it roams the page
[11:29:02] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:29:08] <_|Nix|_> That's another problem.
[11:29:12] <toddmparker_> that's that part we should look at. should bounce it back to the popup again
[11:29:16] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[11:29:25] <_|Nix|_> In the example on SO the items are known.
[11:29:29] <toddmparker_> mind tagging that for 1.3 too
[11:29:37] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's not a real solution
[11:29:44] <toddmparker_> just illustrating
[11:29:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I think I might have to bind to every single element's blur ...
[11:30:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: For all elements inside the popup.
[11:30:13] <toddmparker_> i hope not
[11:30:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, like, container.find("*").bind( "blur" )
[11:30:25] <toddmparker_> UI has this already figured out
[11:30:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah, I guess.
[11:30:41] <toddmparker_> so we can start there
[11:30:45] <_|Nix|_> I hope :)
[11:30:49] <toddmparker_> me too!
[11:30:51] <toddmparker_> ok, agcolom - want to go?
[11:30:55] <agcolom> ok
[11:31:06] <agcolom>     nearly completed listview widget in api docs (needs a few more examples and the final code example) (reached the 10k lines mark on the api docs!)
[11:31:06] <agcolom>     next week:
[11:31:06] <agcolom>         complete listview widget (api docs)
[11:31:06] <agcolom>         update resources page (at least add BB10 theme!)
[11:31:06] <agcolom>         prepare for summit (checklist of what needs doing)
[11:31:06] <agcolom>             if you have items that need to be documented, please let me know
[11:31:24] <agcolom> (sorry for funny formatting!^)
[11:31:30] <toddmparker_> 10k lines of API docs...dang
[11:31:43] <agcolom> yes, I'm rather pleased ;-)
[11:31:51] <toddmparker_> me too. awesome work!
[11:32:26] <JasonDScott_> agcolom: Thanks for adding the BB10 theme!
[11:32:42] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott_: any word on the popularity of that?
[11:32:46] <agcolom> JasonDScott_: you're welcome! That's next on my to do list!!!!
[11:32:58] <agcolom> Only heard great things about it!
[11:33:23] <uGoMobi> still haven't seen a live example but screenshots were great!
[11:33:27] <JasonDScott_> I don't think we have any metrics in place to measure the popularity
[11:33:44] <toddmparker_> yeah, GH forks and followers I guess
[11:34:01] <toddmparker_> agcolom: think we have a bunch of articles to add when there's time
[11:34:25] <agcolom> yes, I want to compelte listview and get back to the resources page
[11:34:27] <JasonDScott_> toddmparker_:  4 and 18
[11:34:37] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:34:46] <toddmparker_> what else are you up to JasonDScott_
[11:35:12] <JasonDScott_> We Released the BlackBerry 10 theme last week at BB Jam americas
[11:35:19] <JasonDScott_> Code: https://github.com/blackberry/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme
[11:35:26] <JasonDScott_> Demo: http://blackberry.github.com/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/
[11:35:38] <JasonDScott_> Widgets that could be brought from the theme into JQM core. All of the following can be view here https://github.com/blackberry/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/tree/master/docs.
[11:35:52] <JasonDScott_> Progress bars
[11:35:52] <JasonDScott_> Gridview
[11:35:54] <JasonDScott_> Dividers
[11:35:55] <JasonDScott_> Dropdown (Not in the above doc. Check http://blackberry.github.com/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/kitchenSink/form.html)
[11:35:56] <JasonDScott_> Transition: cover
[11:35:57] <JasonDScott_> Possibly Overflow menus from the action bar (slide panel widget from stretch goals 1.3)
[11:36:03] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott_: I think the grid view would be good to look at. we have that in the queue for 1.3
[11:36:09] <toddmparker_> based on the listview?
[11:36:25] <uGoMobi> demo looks great
[11:36:25] <JasonDScott_> No its not.
[11:36:41] <JasonDScott_> toddmparker_ I could rework it to be tho
[11:36:47] <toddmparker_> http://blackberry.github.com/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/kitchenSink/gridview.html
[11:37:11] <toddmparker_> yeah, I have that as a goal. Listviews that can be used for photos like that
[11:37:26] <toddmparker_> be good to put that on your list to prototype
[11:38:04] <JasonDScott_> toddmparker_: ok, i'll try that
[11:38:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't see BB10 theme here http://jquerymobile.com/resources/
[11:38:30] <agcolom> uGoMobi: it's not there yet
[11:38:33] <toddmparker_> those selects are cool. they're inline instead of popups. i like
[11:38:34] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:38:55] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: want to go next?
[11:39:01] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:39:08] <uGoMobi> triage: issues for roadmap / Dev Summit / 1.1.2
[11:39:25] <uGoMobi> that's something for the hangout later
[11:39:52] <uGoMobi> working on “dynamic popup with images” demo (with robsmuecker)
[11:39:52] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5101
[11:40:19] <uGoMobi> started with the 1.3 tickets assigned to me
[11:40:31] <uGoMobi> irst:
[11:40:31] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045 (slider full width)
[11:40:31] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875 (IE10 transitions)
[11:40:40] <uGoMobi> s/irst/first/
[11:40:52] <toddmparker_> great
[11:40:53] <uGoMobi> wait with RWD features until after Dev Summit so we can discuss them first
[11:40:59] <toddmparker_> everyone is cranking this week
[11:41:20] <toddmparker_> waiting for 1.2 final to drop took a while
[11:41:34] <toddmparker_> ok, anyone else have an update?
[11:41:58] <toddmparker_> any questions from the community?
[11:42:10] <toddmparker_> if not, we'll wrap and work on DC planning
[11:46:35] <toddmparker_> alright, thanks all
