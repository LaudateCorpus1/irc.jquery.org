[11:58:44] <arschmitz> hi
[11:58:45] <fnagel> hey
[11:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> I need to step away for a few minutes, but I'll be back in a bit.
[11:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to start discussing anything I'm not needed for or just wait a few minutes for me.
[11:59:49] <fnagel> No news regarding datepicker / calendar. Still waiting for review.
[12:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> back
[12:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> So, the big thing for this week is getting tests passing
[12:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryui
[12:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> SO MUCH RED
[12:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to have a bunch of time this week to work on UI, but something came up at work and I'm really busy now.
[12:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> Plus I'll be on vacation next week.
[12:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> If people have time to look into test failures, that'd be a huge help.
[12:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> I cherry-picked a bunch of commits into 1-11-stable: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/1.11.4...1-11-stable
[12:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be good to review tests for that as well.
[12:09:09] <scott_gonzalez> Especially with jQuery 3.0.0.
[12:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> Both master and 1-11-stable still need 3.0.0 pulled in as an external.
[12:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14984 is the only open bug for 1.12.0
[12:15:24] <arschmitz> i can do that
[12:15:32] <arschmitz> the 3.0 stuff
[12:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks arschmitz. That will help with the testing.
[12:15:49] <arschmitz> i think im done reviewing the PR from gabriel seems good to me now
[12:16:01] <arschmitz> if you could just take a look also might not be a bad idea
[12:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll try to do that before I leave the office today.
[12:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Just to confirm, you'll pull 3.0.0 into both branches?
[12:20:40] <arschmitz> yes and run tests
[12:20:50] <arschmitz> and try to take care of any failures
[12:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Will you have time this week to look into tests failures?
[12:21:30] <arschmitz> i just fixed mobile against 3.0 so i know a lot of the changes so hopefully wont be bad
[12:21:31] <jzaefferer> Probably not
[12:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> What about next week?
[12:22:16] <jzaefferer> I might be able to support Alex with specific issues
[12:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> My other question is: If we get to the point where we can do the release, will you be able to do that while I'm on vacation?
[12:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really care about the timing of 1.11.5 vs. 1.12.0.
[12:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to get them both out as soon as we can.
[12:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> The timing is unfortunate with the stuff coming up at work and my vacation next week, because we're so close for both.
[12:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> But if it has to wait a few weeks, it's certainly not the end of the world :-)
[12:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> The releases are the only thing I'm concerned about right now, so that's all I had on the agenda.
[12:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:32:35] <arschmitz> no
[12:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess that's all for today.
[12:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I promise to give feedback on your PR as soon as the release stuff settles down.
[12:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> I know you've been waiting forever.
[12:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
