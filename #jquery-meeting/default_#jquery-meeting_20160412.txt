[14:03:27] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting
[14:03:34] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, kristyjy, arschmitz
[14:04:05] <thej> hey guys !
[14:04:09] <nashvail> hello everyone!
[14:04:43] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:05:02] <kristyjy> hello
[14:05:06] <rawteech> hello
[14:06:01] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:06:30] <sfrisk> first up, JSASS update is pulled in, so for anyone who was having issues with node 5+, that is resolved now
[14:06:43] <sfrisk> kristyjy, how goes the tables pr and converting everything to classes?
[14:06:54] <geekman-rohit> thats nice
[14:07:28] <nashvail> cool
[14:08:49] <kristyjy> It's going kinda slow I'm bummed to report. My professional life has been kinda busy but I'm going to cut out some time to work on it tonight
[14:10:31] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy, story of my life right now :D
[14:11:41] <sfrisk> okay RTL
[14:11:42] <kristyjy> yeah it's the worst
[14:11:47] <sfrisk> I know there has been an update to that
[14:11:58] <sfrisk> although I haven't had a chance to review it yet because I've been at work
[14:12:57] <thej> ok sure
[14:13:35] <sfrisk> that being said, it looks like the travis build is failing
[14:13:56] <sfrisk> ah, the 100 chars thing
[14:14:02] <sfrisk> ping @arschmitz
[14:14:05] <thej> yeah, should I break it up ?
[14:14:13] <sfrisk> also I would merge in master, looks like there are some conflicts
[14:14:35] <arschmitz> hi sorry family stuff going on was not paying attention whats up?
[14:15:58] <thej> sfrisk: will resolve them tonight
[14:16:16] <sfrisk> Regarding https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/150
[14:16:43] <sfrisk> Travis build fails because grunt task crosses 100 chars
[14:17:07] <arschmitz> it fails because its not following the style guide fix it and it will pass
[14:17:19] <arschmitz> 100 chars is part of the style guide that line is too long
[14:17:29] <sfrisk> so break it up then
[14:17:35] <thej> ok
[14:17:48] <arschmitz> yeah the style guide says that should be broken into like 10 lines
[14:18:17] <sfrisk> okay, thej, merge in what's in master, then break up the task
[14:18:26] <arschmitz> but i guess my bigger question is
[14:18:35] <arschmitz> i thought we talked that this was not even the correct approach
[14:18:43] <arschmitz> css janus
[14:18:49] <arschmitz> since it generates seperate files
[14:18:57] <sfrisk> it's been udpated
[14:19:09] <sfrisk> oh wait, I thought it had been
[14:19:34] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/150/files
[14:19:58] <sfrisk> looks like the two css files are getting concated together
[14:20:16] <thej> yes, I am doing that currently
[14:20:19] <arschmitz> wont the duplicate everything?
[14:20:45] <arschmitz> css janus generates the entire file not just the parts it changes right?
[14:20:48] <sfrisk> I think so, now that I'm looking at the code
[14:21:06] <arschmitz> from my understanding of css janus it wont work for what we talked about
[14:21:07] <thej> it generates the entire file
[14:21:15] <sfrisk> also I don't think we're going through existing files to figure out what gets flipped and what gets ignored
[14:21:23] <arschmitz> you would need to have a task that would de-dup all the rules
[14:21:47] <arschmitz> plus you need to as sfrisk mentioned make sure only the correct things are flipped
[14:22:05] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/150#issuecomment-203052895
[14:22:08] <arschmitz> which is complicated like some icons should be flipped but many should not and its specific to the icon chose
[14:22:58] <thej> ok, or we can ditch cssjanus for something similar to these lines http://www.sitepoint.com/manage-rtl-css-sass-grunt/ ?
[14:23:02] <sfrisk> for example, if you had a github icon, you wouldn't want to flip that
[14:23:21] <thej> yeah, you would want to flip things like arrow marks
[14:23:41] <arschmitz> thej that is not correct
[14:23:48] <arschmitz> arrows should generally NOT be flipped
[14:24:23] <thej> oh ok
[14:24:32] <arschmitz> the forward, back, fast forworward etc icons should not be flipped
[14:24:48] <arschmitz> the concept of forward and back direction are the same regardless of orientation
[14:24:58] <arschmitz> its a throw back from the days of VCR and tape players
[14:26:39] <thej> cssjanus doesnt handle these stuff , needs manual work , am i right ?
[14:26:49] <arschmitz> yes as far as im aware
[14:27:38] <thej> ok will work on it this week
[14:28:54] <thej> do we really need cssjanus then ?
[14:29:18] <arschmitz> no i dont think so
[14:29:24] <sfrisk> I'm almost thinking maybe we shouldn't have it be automatic
[14:29:33] <thej> yes, agreed
[14:30:07] <sfrisk> okay, I'm going to close the PR then
[14:30:10] <sfrisk> with a note
[14:32:16] <sfrisk> next up Image basic styling - looks like that has been updated
[14:33:25] <sfrisk> didn't realizeuntil just now since for whatever reason github doesn't like updating me when a commit happens
[14:33:27] <sfrisk> just a comment
[14:34:02] <sfrisk> that being said, I now that nashvail and thej talked about wanting to work on a UI library for components
[14:34:22] <sfrisk> did you make any progress on that
[14:35:07] <nashvail> I went through some styles and have collected some inspirations from dribbble and other places nothing concrete I can show as of now though
[14:36:25] <nashvail> was a little busy giving final touches to https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/the-beauty-of-react-native-building-your-first-ios-app-with-javascript-part-1/ </shameless-plug> might come in useful to folks interested in RN around here
[14:37:42] <sfrisk> Go you!
[14:38:29] <sfrisk> okay then, everyone review what's currently in  https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/149 right now
[14:38:30] <nashvail> ðŸ˜Š
[14:38:36] <sfrisk> and leave comments on there
[14:38:50] <sfrisk> next up is Grunt: 'grunt watch' runs all tasks at beginning
[14:38:54] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/147
[14:39:05] <nashvail> That's mine very basic
[14:39:37] <nashvail> I just wanted the build task to run when I CDd into the directory and ran grunt-watch
[14:40:31] <nashvail> Otherwise I had to run grunt-build and then grunt-watch
[14:41:09] <sfrisk> ping arschmitz
[14:42:36] <sfrisk> We've got two grunt tasks to discuss
[14:43:25] <nashvail> if someone could quickly do a check on the second one It'd be great, I still have some doubts about it
[14:43:45] <nashvail> the second last commit is what I am sure of works
[14:43:48] <sfrisk> thus the pinging of arschmitz
[14:43:53] <sfrisk> and geekman-rohit
[14:43:56] <sfrisk> all the pinging
[14:44:39] <geekman-rohit> nashvail ur pr works fine
[14:44:53] <geekman-rohit> last I checked
[14:45:19] <sfrisk> the variable changes one has been updated since last you commented
[14:46:10] <nashvail> yes the one before geekman-rohit 's comment (second last commit) works
[14:46:12] <nashvail> 100%
[14:46:30] <nashvail> I tried speeding up the build process by setting the value of spawn
[14:46:48] <nashvail> to true, but guess that causes problems not sure if just with me
[14:47:02] <nashvail> if bulding time isn't an issue we can stick with the second last commit
[14:47:46] <geekman-rohit> wait
[14:47:50] <geekman-rohit> we are talking of 146?
[14:47:54] <geekman-rohit> or 147
[14:47:59] <sfrisk> 146 and 147 I guess
[14:48:07] <geekman-rohit> 146 looks weird
[14:48:22] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/146/files
[14:48:28] <geekman-rohit> that just adds a new task
[14:48:43] <nashvail> In the this commit https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/146/commits/1f3fcd6d3e4d4fc5fd5c7d7ba51e57faf18ba550
[14:48:57] <geekman-rohit> ur new commits
[14:49:01] <geekman-rohit> overwrite your old changes
[14:49:07] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/146/commits/adef4184922219aae99e6a730e875d37ad2696aa
[14:49:31] <geekman-rohit> the PR as a whole does only one thing, adding jssasvars task
[14:49:36] <geekman-rohit> jsassvars*
[14:49:43] <nashvail> Ok I am quickly going to revert the last two commits
[14:49:50] <nashvail> and do a final check
[14:50:07] <nashvail> setting spawn to true isn't a problem right now
[14:50:08] <nashvail> right ?
[14:50:15] <geekman-rohit> not at all
[14:50:37] <geekman-rohit> it offers reliability at cost of little more time
[14:50:42] <geekman-rohit> I think we can afford that
[14:50:48] <nashvail> awesome
[14:50:55] <geekman-rohit> why did you add the jsassvars task?
[14:51:40] <nashvail> I was thinking that setting spawn to true only on the build that results from  jsassvars changes would kind of speed up the build process a little bit
[14:51:53] <nashvail> but that didn't work out that well
[14:53:04] <geekman-rohit> it might worl
[14:53:05] <geekman-rohit> work
[14:53:28] <geekman-rohit> ur latest commit removes all the changes u made earlier
[14:53:40] <geekman-rohit> that looks like a minor mistake at your part that messed it up
[14:54:36] <nashvail> Yes, seems like so
[14:55:44] <sfrisk> okay, peeps, i need to go to a work meeting
[14:55:49] <sfrisk> so I'm going to have to wrap this up
[14:55:52] <geekman-rohit> 147 can go in
[14:55:58] <nashvail> So I am going back to the state of the watch.js file as it was on this commit https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/146/commits/1f3fcd6d3e4d4fc5fd5c7d7ba51e57faf18ba550
[14:56:03] <nashvail> quickly
[14:56:07] <nashvail> that's alright ?
[14:57:23] <geekman-rohit> sure
[14:57:50] <geekman-rohit> also
[14:58:02] <geekman-rohit> i think you should try setting spawn to true on the watch task
[14:58:06] <geekman-rohit> not the other tasks
[14:58:43] <sfrisk> okay, peeps, need to close up the channel
[14:58:47] <nashvail> makes sense, you know what I am going to do a final run on this and push one final commit by tommorrow
[14:58:50] <sfrisk> you can finish the discussion in #css-chassis
[14:59:05] <nashvail> sure
[14:59:29] <geekman-rohit> sure
[14:59:36] <geekman-rohit> good day everyone
