[12:03:20] <bethge__> hi, sorry, bouncer departed. Are we meeting today?
[12:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:04:25] <bethge__> ok, awesome
[12:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> That `hasPointerCapture` PR looks good.
[12:04:41] <bethge__> Great. I will ahead and merge it after the meeting
[12:04:52] <bethge__> *go
[12:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[12:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> Do you think we should close https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/336 as a duplicate?
[12:10:18] <bethge__> Yeah, I would say so.
[12:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:10:56] <bethge__> I would also go ahead and close: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/278 . We tried it in https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/309 and noticed it didn't quite make sense.
[12:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> (re-reading the conversations)
[12:13:20] <bethge__> I just checked the support matrix to make sure: Safari will support passive events soon. Now I will also have to dig deeper again
[12:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> Safari already has support.
[12:14:19] <bethge__> Ah ok
[12:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> http://caniuse.com/#feat=passive-event-listener
[12:14:56] <bethge__> riight
[12:15:30] <bethge__> I think I remember now. Passive Event Listeners without proper touch-action attribute was the issue
[12:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yeah, and they don't have touch-actin.
[12:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> Though on iOS Safari, there's partial support.
[12:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that partial support helps us though.
[12:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's the problem.
[12:17:35] <bethge__> Right, I think it is just to avoid the delay for click events
[12:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll close it.
[12:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to get the release done today or tomorrow.
[12:19:13] <bethge__> Awesome!
[12:19:31] <bethge__> Some people have become ... impatient ;-)
[12:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> yeah...
[12:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have anything else to discuss today?
[12:24:19] <bethge__> Nope. See you next week!
[12:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> Alright. See ya.
