[09:00:53] <jzaefferer> weee
[09:00:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:01:02] <tj_vantoll> :)
[09:01:06] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:01:28] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:35] <scott_gonzalez> Got ticket and PR counts down again :-)
[09:01:45] <Tanay> Hey
[09:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> At this point, I can't do much more with the PRs.
[09:01:47] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[09:01:52] <interestinall> hi everyone!
[09:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> I don't plan on reviewing the old PRs that deal with interactions or datepicker.
[09:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> Because I'm never confident that they won't cause regressions.
[09:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> Even when they come with new tests.
[09:02:22] <jzaefferer> -9 is pretty nice
[09:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:02:32] <tj_vantoll> It's great to see the PR number down so low.
[09:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a few more that should be closed soonish.
[09:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll end up with about 10 stagnant PRs.
[09:03:14] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> I feel bad closing them with basically "Sorry, we're not going to land anything for this component."
[09:03:49] <mikesherov> better than "speak to you again in 2 years"
[09:03:54] <jzaefferer> this can land today: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1449
[09:04:05] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov: agreed
[09:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> You've got it passing now?
[09:04:12] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> So we should just close them?
[09:04:20] <Tanay> Hello all, My name is Tanay Pant and I wanted to showcase my proposal on jQuery UI demo for GSoC: https://gist.github.com/tanay1337/484daa8bb8410bcb607a
[09:04:20] <Tanay> It would be great if you all could take a quick peek and advice how this could be improved :)
[09:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> Tanay: We'll review and get back to you in #jqueryui-dev.
[09:04:45] <jzaefferer> Tanay: I've put that at the end of the agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4ieJTELlFeUo9ycooPTqWv0gtIt-44T-47Y2F_100U/edit#gid=847039809
[09:05:02] <Tanay> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez Thank you a lot :D
[09:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Got an ETA for next round of updates on classes?
[09:05:40] <arschmitz> im working on it right now so probably this afternoon there was not much there
[09:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it was pretty much ready to land.
[09:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we'll get that in master by the end of the week then.
[09:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> And that'll get us one less PR :-)
[09:06:18] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: are you going to update button again or this that independent of classes landing?
[09:06:20] * scott_gonzalez realizes that just means doing a full review of buttons...
[09:06:33] <jzaefferer> *is that
[09:06:51] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ill update again
[09:07:05] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: gotcha, let me know
[09:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> And at that point you should close the PR and send a new one with the updates against master.
[09:07:12] <arschmitz> there is nothing that requires it but ill rebase on master
[09:07:20] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup thats what i was saying
[09:07:33] <arschmitz> because you cant switch pr branches
[09:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:07:43] <jzaefferer> getting this low on PRs is also good for the thousands of style updates we've got to land at some point
[09:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yup
[09:08:05] <jzaefferer> I'm making progress with esformatter, but wouldn't want to mess up big PRs with that
[09:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Do you have time today or tomorrow to go through the open PRs with me and just see which should stay open?
[09:08:27] <jzaefferer> classes and button should land in master first, datepicker can be addressed in the branch
[09:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> I landed Felix's datepicker PR.
[09:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> So back to selectmenu.
[09:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> Last week we agreed that we would change the default width to an explicit value.
[09:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> But we never came to agreement on what that would be.
[09:10:19] <jzaefferer> 250px!
[09:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz proposed having `width: false` mean do not set an inline style at all.
[09:10:23] <arschmitz> then we spent another 3 hours talking about how
[09:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> And then having the CSS set a width in ems.
[09:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> And that would become our new default.
[09:10:48] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: thanks for that
[09:10:51] <fnagel> still so budy
[09:10:56] <fnagel> * busy
[09:10:57] <arschmitz> when we drop core 1.7 we can set em in the js
[09:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> We very rarely have false and null behave differently.
[09:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, that too.
[09:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of which....
[09:11:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that is true and im not crazy about it
[09:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Do you think anyone from core would be willing to reimplement .outerWidth(), etc. setters in UI?
[09:12:01] <arschmitz> well not really null and false are different in all the form elements
[09:12:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: why?
[09:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> Our implementation (which we use to support 1.6) only supports pixel values.
[09:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> When the methods were later added to core, they supported everything.
[09:12:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: 1.6 and 1.7 right we dropped 1.6 support already
[09:13:08] <mikesherov> I landed the setters in 1.8 of Core
[09:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> Right, which we use to support 1.7.
[09:13:22] <mikesherov> we're dropping 1.7 support?
[09:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> And if we could use .outerWidth( "14em" ), then we'd be able to get the default value for selectmenu width that we want to use.
[09:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> No, we don't want to drop 1.7 support.
[09:13:44] <mikesherov> oh duh
[09:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why we want .outerWidth() setter to support ems.
[09:13:47] <mikesherov> we only dropped 1.6
[09:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> The code in core is way too confusing for me.
[09:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> Every time I look at it, I just give up.
[09:14:14] <mikesherov> ha
[09:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> That's been the case for years.
[09:14:18] <arschmitz> yeah i looked too
[09:14:21] <arschmitz> and said no thank you
[09:14:21] <mikesherov> thank gibson042 and me for that
[09:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think it may be the most confusing code in core.
[09:14:42] <mikesherov> it's the absolute minimal implementation
[09:15:01] <mikesherov> we both bikeshedded that for days, squeezing out every bit
[09:15:04] <fnagel> Now I need to take a look at that code - thanks :-D
[09:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> Would you be interested in reimplementing in UI?
[09:15:11] <mikesherov> Sure
[09:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:15:19] <mikesherov> limited availability for next few weeks
[09:15:22] <mikesherov> but yes, I can
[09:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> You'd be replacing this code: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/core.js#L153
[09:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's entirely possible that it's just a few lines that need to change.
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't know exactly what's happening in core.
[09:17:14] <jzaefferer> Can we somehow avoid that change blocking the selectmenu default width change?
[09:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> Not unless we decide to add width: false and use CSS.
[09:18:01] <jzaefferer> Or set a fixed width in px?
[09:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> Or that, but I don't think people really wanted to do that.
[09:18:33] <arschmitz> yeah thats pretty terrible for responsive
[09:18:50] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I don't think the setters actually work how you expect.
[09:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check something.
[09:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not at all.
[09:21:18] <arschmitz> ?
[09:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<div>" ).appendTo( "body" ).css( "padding", "5px" ).outerWidth( "14em" )[0].style.width // 4em
[09:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> 14em - 5px - 5px = 14 - 5 -5 = 4 = 4em
[09:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> So, yes, you can pass units to the setters, but they don't get calculated as you'd expect.
[09:22:58] <arschmitz> interesting
[09:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> We could use `box-sizing: border-box` though.
[09:23:22] <arschmitz> yup
[09:23:41] <arschmitz> using it in controlgroup anyway for this lol
[09:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> But at that point, we're basically saying "We have an API, you CANNOT use content-box with it.
[09:24:02] <arschmitz> you can you would just need to understand how it calculates
[09:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> We can't say that.
[09:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> We can't say "understand how this is broken"
[09:24:55] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:25:23] <jzaefferer> we already have interactions for that
[09:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Was it intended that the setters support units?
[09:25:32] <mikesherov> I dunno
[09:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:25:44] <mikesherov> I just made tests and didn't break any
[09:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> I was surprised last week when arschmitz said that they worked.
[09:26:05] <mikesherov> core is supposed to convert everything to px anyway
[09:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> It wasn't in my proposal for the API.
[09:26:18] <mikesherov> 14em should NOT work
[09:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> Only for getters though, right?
[09:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: There you go. Unsupported.
[09:26:34] <mikesherov> but setters imply getters
[09:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> So we're back to `width: false` with CSS.
[09:27:06] <mikesherov> so I'm not doing anything
[09:27:07] <arschmitz> seems that way
[09:27:10] <mikesherov> hooray
[09:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Correct.
[09:27:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:27:16] <arschmitz> lol
[09:27:21] <mikesherov> plus, screw every other unit other than px
[09:27:28] <arschmitz> ha ha
[09:27:31] <mikesherov> because cssom is heavily entrenched in px
[09:27:36] <jzaefferer> oh well
[09:27:39] <mikesherov> minefield to use it for anything else
[09:28:23] <arschmitz> lol
[09:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> So thoughts on `width: false` as default?
[09:28:41] <scott_gonzalez> And having false = no inline style, null = match existing width
[09:29:12] <jzaefferer> seems good
[09:29:45] <fnagel> seems reasonable, alternative would be?
[09:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably make it very clear that `width: null` means copy the pixel width of the element at the time of creation.
[09:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> And not "copy the CSS width value"
[09:30:06] <arschmitz> it still kinda matches what we do for form elements with disabled "null" === check dom false === "dont do thing"
[09:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> true
[09:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, and we'll use 14em in the stylesheet for the default width.
[09:31:06] <arschmitz> it gives us the best flexibility too
[09:31:21] <arschmitz> because then people can do whatever they want in their css
[09:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> And you can do you insane `width: auto` :-P
[09:31:47] <arschmitz> lol
[09:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, last update before GSoC...
[09:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> CSS dependencies landed in master :-)
[09:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> That gets us to Tanay's proposal for the demo system.
[09:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/tanay1337/484daa8bb8410bcb607a
[09:32:49] <rxaviers> \o/ the change is simple, although polemical
[09:32:53] <rxaviers> :-)
[09:33:00] <Tanay> Right :)
[09:34:16] <Tanay> I was wondering if you could kindly review my proposal and could let me know how I can improve it?
[09:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What's the process here?
[09:36:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: Tanay is just looking for feed back on the application there is a formal review process with the mentors later
[09:37:11] <Tanay> Yes :)
[09:37:46] <interestinall> I also have a GSoC related question when you all have a min. Is this the sort of demo you are looking for in terms of individual elements? http://jsbin.com/xawufi/16/edit?output
[09:38:18] <interestinall> Or do you prefer a more default style? or..
[09:39:10] <scott_gonzalez> I think we definitely want less styling in terms of the amount of CSS that's there compared to the visual style of what's presented.
[09:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> That's a lot of code to look through in a demo.
[09:39:41] <interestinall> yeah i cut the date picker out of another larger set
[09:39:54] <interestinall> i can cut the css down to the minimal. no prob.
[09:39:58] <arschmitz> interestinall: also to keep in mind these end up in small boxes
[09:40:20] <arschmitz> that breaks at anything remotely small
[09:40:42] <interestinall> ok. what size are we talking about?
[09:40:56] <arschmitz> interestinall: your breaks under 1200px
[09:41:19] <arschmitz> ours are like 580px i think
[09:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we'll also want to consider mobile devices.
[09:41:42] <arschmitz> yup
[09:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> The demo pages probably need a different design.
[09:42:08] <arschmitz> yeah something a bit more dedicated
[09:42:32] <Tanay> Okay, any specific format?
[09:43:01] <interestinall> that's no problem in terms of width. i was just focused on a quick look mock up because arschmitz thought a previous design was too involved.
[09:43:42] <interestinall> but if i make it mobile friendly is that an acceptable look?
[09:43:50] <Tanay> Too involved?
[09:43:54] <arschmitz> i dont think we have a format in mind for how the demos should be just know what we have now is not ideal
[09:46:21] <arschmitz> for mobile we have a special versioned demos website thats created from the repo but im not sure we need anything like that for ui
[09:47:34] <bond007__> arschmitz: ping
[09:48:02] <arschmitz> bond007__: yes?
[09:49:18] <bond007__>  arschmitz: I am interested in working for `jQuery UI - new demo system` idea under gsoc , to get acquainted with jquery code base should I start by fixing bugs ? If yes can you point to easy-bugs which can help me quickly get started with development ?
[09:49:39] <arschmitz> bond007__: as i said we are discussing the demos task now
[09:49:57] <arschmitz> for other things i will answer in #jquery-ui dev shortly
[09:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> #jqueryui-dev
[09:50:22] <arschmitz> you can read the backlog discussion here http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20150304.log.html#t09:37:46
[09:50:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yes sorry
[09:50:36] <arschmitz> got that all wrong lol
[09:51:07] <bond007__> thanks! I'll check it out.
[09:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think any other feedback about GSoC will happen in #jqueryui-dev
[09:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:53:05] <interestinall> thanks!
