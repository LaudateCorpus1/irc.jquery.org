[09:07:06] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:07:27] <jzaefferer> so here's an agenda document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FbWhiFQ9gWQvB1Tm4QM_OC4me-ha2ujDWH5sdF7ueo/edit
[09:07:29] <jzaefferer> nothing much there yet
[09:07:51] <jzaefferer> apparently johnbend1r is around, Krinkle isn't
[09:11:25] <johnbend1r> Added a line item for perf regression testing
[09:11:55] <johnbend1r> note: my nick is odd because I'm on my mac, I'm leaving my lenovo on the stand tied to all my peripherals
[09:12:33] <DaveMethvin> i just thought you were e1eet johnbend1r
[09:12:39] <DaveMethvin> i'm around if you need me for the meeting
[09:12:49] <DaveMethvin> like to yell at core for not having passing tests
[09:13:25] <gnarf> why not johnbend3r tho?
[09:14:16] <DaveMethvin> he doesn't go that high
[09:14:31] <gnarf> johnbend]≅r
[09:14:34] <gnarf> ?
[09:14:43] <gnarf> didn't really work
[09:14:48] * gnarf shrugs
[09:14:49] <johnbend1r> gnarf: it was automatic
[09:14:56] <gnarf> this a testing meeting?
[09:15:15] <johnbend1r> it's a test of the continue integration testing meeting
[09:15:24] <johnbend1r> *continuous
[09:15:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: I set clarkbox on the task of helping you guys work on the jenkins server, he was looking for stuff to help with
[09:15:42] <gnarf> so let him know about this meeting time ;)
[09:16:26] <gnarf> the jquery-git process seems to be working well now
[09:16:44] <gnarf> when we can remove the "scp" step, I'll feel a lil better about it
[09:18:01] <gnarf> jzaefferer: I don't nessecarily think we need all the services over on that box by the conference, but soon there after, I'd like to make sure we are using the new machine for swarm/jenkins/etc... I'm hoping by July 5 or 12 - does this seem like a reasonable amount of time?
[09:18:31] <gnarf> We should be able to have more than one build running at a time
[09:19:23] <johnbend1r> gnarf: :D
[09:20:55] <jzaefferer> ugh, sorry guys, the dog walking into the room distracted me there for a bit
[09:21:11] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, moving sometime after the conf sounds good
[09:21:35] <jzaefferer> Clark emailed me, maybe I'll meet with him here in SF
[09:21:43] <jzaefferer> could then talk through that setup, see where he can help
[09:22:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: he offered up his work space
[09:22:27] <gnarf> he said there was plenty of co-working desks there
[09:22:30] <jzaefferer> yep
[09:22:33] <gnarf> so def get a hold of him
[09:22:35] <gnarf> :)
[09:22:45] <gnarf> hell, if we can get it done before the conf, even better
[09:22:50] <jzaefferer> johnbend1r: can you provide some details on perf regression testing?
[09:22:59] <johnbend1r> jzaefferer: yes!
[09:23:14] <johnbend1r> so at some point in the near future the jqm team is going to start tackling performance
[09:23:24] <johnbend1r> which requires a few things
[09:23:36] <johnbend1r> 1. measurement
[09:23:41] <johnbend1r> 2. data collection
[09:23:46] <johnbend1r> 3. automation
[09:24:07] <gnarf> johnbend1r: perhaps we should talk to matjas about building a "perfswarm"
[09:24:14] <johnbend1r> I have some early thoughts on a simple starter solution
[09:24:23] <johnbend1r> I don't want to do anything super complex before I have something working
[09:25:00] <johnbend1r> gnarf: but that would be the end game
[09:25:08] <johnbend1r> browserstack and stats data storage
[09:25:10] * gnarf nods - might be worth pinging matjas for thoughts anyway
[09:25:15] <johnbend1r> gnarf: will do
[09:25:20] * johnbend1r notes the name matjas
[09:25:23] <gnarf> he prolly has some insight from jsperf.com
[09:25:33] <johnbend1r> benchmark.js
[09:25:34] <jzaefferer> browserscope has an API that you can use directly as well
[09:25:38] <johnbend1r> I was going to use it
[09:25:45] * johnbend1r notes browserscope
[09:25:47] <gnarf> @mathias = matjas on irc
[09:26:04] <johnbend1r> yarp
[09:26:37] <johnbend1r> that won't be for a few weeks I think
[09:26:53] <johnbend1r> with the conf and some other more pressing issues coming up
[09:26:56] <gnarf> its a great idea tho
[09:27:08] <gnarf> if we had some sort of perf graphs, like we could write "unit perfs"
[09:27:09] <johnbend1r> needs to happen before we start working on the perf thing
[09:27:29] <johnbend1r> yah, my hope was that it would be as easy as writing unit tests
[09:27:33] <gnarf> and have some sort of automation testing these things per build
[09:27:39] <johnbend1r> yep
[09:28:00] <johnbend1r> gnarf: and report when something changes for the worse within some threshold
[09:28:09] <johnbend1r> one/two standard deviations
[09:28:25] <gnarf> +∞
[09:28:41] <gnarf> can't second that idea enough
[09:29:10] <jzaefferer> is there an API for jsperf?
[09:29:15] <johnbend1r> no
[09:29:17] <johnbend1r> I wish there was
[09:29:21] <johnbend1r> that was my first hope
[09:29:32] <gnarf> there might be, and we just don't know its there :)
[09:29:34] <johnbend1r> but the library they use benchmarkjs is open source
[09:29:42] <jzaefferer> so where do you see that mostly in use? For jQuery Core? UI/Mobile?
[09:29:56] <johnbend1r> jzaefferer: everywhere I guess
[09:30:08] <johnbend1r> obviously I'm going to start with mobile
[09:30:11] <gnarf> anywhere there are perf critical paths I would imagine
[09:30:35] <gnarf> oh btw - I realized yesterday that we don't have a Sizzle job on jenkins
[09:30:35] <johnbend1r> gnarf: it would be amazing if we could even just get the schema that they use at jsperf to save the trouble
[09:30:58] <gnarf> johnbend1r: yeah, I'm sure @mathias / matjas will help us out with that, hence the suggestion to ping him
[09:31:00] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, but then sizzle doesn't even have grunt
[09:31:09] <johnbend1r> gnarf: I love being friends with the cool kids :D
[09:31:16] <jzaefferer> need to get that in place first, figure out the linting setup, get lint fixed...
[09:31:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sounds good - timmy has been putting a lot of work into sizzle this last week
[09:31:50] <gnarf> and it only tests when he pushes to jQuery :)
[09:33:10] <jzaefferer> I've created a grunt.js file, could just push that and have timmy figure out the linting issues
[09:33:23] <jzaefferer> couldn't really tell if its stuff to fix in source or by adapting the jshint rules
[09:33:47] <gnarf> jzaefferer: branch / pull request it over to timmy?
[09:34:05] <jzaefferer> sure
[09:34:11] <gnarf> he might be able to solve that today
[09:34:16] <gnarf> timmywil: ^^^ ?
[09:34:19] <jzaefferer> or I'll just push it directly, the grunt.js itself won't hurt anyone
[09:34:42] <gnarf> I suppose, but since its "not passing" figured a branch was safer ;)
[09:34:44] <jzaefferer> so why did I delete that ...
[09:35:55] <timmywil> yea I can do that :)
[09:38:01] <timmywil> jzaefferer: so now I'm curious, lint is failing on sizzle but passes in a built a jquery?
[09:38:07] <timmywil> -a
[09:38:18] <jzaefferer> okay, just pushed a grunt.js file - timmywil there's plenty linting issue, mostly in that selector.js test
[09:38:30] <jzaefferer> haven't yet looked into those, but should be easy enough to fix
[09:39:07] <gnarf> what timmywil said is also interesting, I imagine we are using different jshintrc options?
[09:39:08] <timmywil> ah, the unit tests
[09:39:10] <jzaefferer> so once those are gone, I can add a Jenkins job to run the default task
[09:39:30] <timmywil> well, hmm, that should get run too
[09:39:46] <timmywil> i'll take a look
[09:40:52] <gnarf> also, curiosity makes me wonder if Sizzle should have its own section on code.jquery.com - but I imagine very few people use sizzle by itself
[09:43:29] <jzaefferer> johnbend1r: about getting mobile on swarm - first thing is to add a testswarm task for mobile's grunt setup, here a copy of the one in UI would probably be best
[09:43:35] <jzaefferer> want to look into that?
[09:43:47] <jzaefferer> we can then create a custom browserSet that just includes latest iPhone, to start with
[09:44:05] <jzaefferer> or iPhone + regular Safari and Chrome, to get same basic coverage
[09:44:32] <timmywil> ah, jquery doesn't lint its unit tests
[09:44:38] <timmywil> that would explain it
[09:45:11] <jzaefferer> well, you can kick that file out from grunt.js, or actually fix those issues
[09:46:24] <johnbend1r> jzaefferer: yah that was what we talked about earlier, you just told me to wait until it got clean up :D
[09:46:52] <johnbend1r> *cleaned
[09:46:56] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[09:47:01] <jzaefferer> well, that's done :-)
[09:47:51] <jzaefferer> need to create swarm accounts for sizzle and mobile, but thats easy
[09:48:17] <jzaefferer> just use the UI testswarm task as a reference and pull "jquerymobile" from the config
[09:48:25] <jzaefferer> that'll contain tokens and base urls
[09:49:51] <johnbend1r> jzaefferer: nice, thanks for adding that
[09:51:00] <jzaefferer> okay, that's probably all we've got for now
[09:51:14] <jzaefferer> too bad Krinkle didn't make it
[09:52:01] <johnbend1r> :(
[09:52:02] <johnbend1r> yar
[09:52:15] <gnarf> timmywil: we probably should
[09:54:15] <timmywil> agreed
[11:01:41] <toddparker> hi
[11:01:46] <uGoMobi> hello
[11:01:51] <MauriceG> Hi
[11:01:51] <JasonDScott> Hi
[11:01:52] <toddparker> the jQuery Mobile meeting is now starting
[11:02:15] <_|Nix|_> Geym akk!
[11:02:20] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:02:24] <toddparker> Agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gcm7c7gKD-ETJkFyQHFrJDKyDJhAXktCWLAQHFMPmhg/edit#
[11:02:38] <gseguin> hiya!
[11:02:52] <toddparker> gang's all here
[11:02:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: subtitles please
[11:03:03] <toddparker> saw johnbender is already here too
[11:03:11] <toddparker> ok, let's jump in
[11:03:25] <toddparker> subtitles?
[11:03:37] <toddparker> my update first
[11:03:38] <toddparker> Down to 350 issues (from 600) and 12 PR’s (down from 50+) in the last 2 months
[11:03:44] <toddparker> (yay!)
[11:03:45] <uGoMobi> Geym akk! ???
[11:03:49] <johnbender> HELL YAH
[11:04:00] <toddparker> great job on bug triage and PR reviews everyone
[11:04:07] * johnbender gives suitecases filled with money to uGoMobi agcolom _|Nix|_ 
[11:04:12] <toddparker> yup
[11:04:30] <toddparker> i keep thinking the PR count will go up but you are on it
[11:04:38] <toddparker> Site re-templating for the conference - met with Richard, Todd is working on porting over the static pages, Richard to port the blog, then we need to make CSS changes
[11:04:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ROTFL :)
[11:04:53] <toddparker> still a lot to do there
[11:04:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "Hey, all!"
[11:05:02] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm supossed to talk with Richard today briefly about jquerymobile.com
[11:05:09] <johnbender> as an added note
[11:05:11] <toddparker> speak *American* here please :)
[11:05:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, thanks :-)
[11:05:17] <toddparker> like the cheese
[11:05:36] <toddparker> Download builder alpha for conference - ready to go gseguin
[11:06:02] * gseguin is starting to sweat
[11:06:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: "'merican"
[11:06:12] <toddparker> no bugs, right?
[11:06:18] <toddparker> nice _|Nix|_
[11:06:31] <toddparker> ok, lets quickly review the 1.1.1 items I flagged last week
[11:06:36] <johnbender>  _|Nix|_ dun git it rite
[11:07:09] <toddparker> first, a new one - Opera 12 broken navigation
[11:07:09] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4521
[11:07:10] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4521 on jquery-mobile (chrisben; 6d, 8h ago): navigation broken in Opera12
[11:07:48] <uGoMobi> we can fix that by start supporting transitions on Opera
[11:08:20] <toddparker> looks like opera is losing prefixes very soon
[11:08:28] <johnbender> toddparker: talked with Mike too he's looking into it from their side
[11:08:32] <uGoMobi> not something we would normally do in a bug fixes release
[11:08:57] <toddparker> yeah, think this should be deferred
[11:09:06] <toddparker> but i don't want opera broken
[11:09:32] <johnbender> gseguin: do we have a back channel hangout?
[11:09:35] <johnbender> I can play music
[11:09:37] <johnbender> :D
[11:09:46] <toddparker> nope
[11:09:51] <gseguin> johnbender: no should I create one?
[11:10:00] <toddparker> think we're ok
[11:10:01] <johnbender> gseguin: we can wait until technical discussions
[11:10:07] <toddparker> let's flag this to discuss
[11:10:08] <gseguin> ok
[11:10:13] <johnbender> FLAGGED!
[11:10:14] <toddparker> ok, moving on
[11:10:39] <toddparker> listview click performance (ready to land + benchmark) - todo
[11:10:46] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340
[11:10:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4340 on jquery-mobile (mruffolo; 1m, 1w ago): slow response when clicking item in large listview on mobile devices
[11:11:03] <johnbender> we decided to just do it and suffer the consequences right?
[11:11:11] <johnbender> seems like it's a win
[11:11:13] <toddparker> think so yes
[11:11:25] <toddparker> comment out that line, check unit tests and land it
[11:11:34] <toddparker> I tried it and sisn't see issues
[11:11:36] <gseguin> alright I'll do that
[11:11:55] <toddparker> but they will be convered if we browse around if there are eye cases
[11:11:55] <toddparker> cool
[11:12:02] <toddparker> that is the #1 regression with 1.1
[11:12:13] <toddparker> slow = bad
[11:12:18] <_|Nix|_> Sorry I couldn't back you guys up with perf tests. The perf test stuff is still pretty new to me.
[11:12:20] <toddparker> ok, gseguin is on it
[11:12:25] <toddparker> it's ok
[11:12:31] <gseguin> not really a regression though
[11:12:41] <toddparker> i do want to test this empirically to see if this really does get us back to 1.0
[11:12:49] <toddparker> a perf regression
[11:12:57] <gseguin> it's always been there
[11:13:00] <toddparker> 1.0 is a lot faster clicking an item on that page
[11:13:23] <toddparker> even tho the code is old, the perf issue is new somehow
[11:13:33] <toddparker> any theories why?
[11:13:44] * johnbender is bewildered
[11:13:46] <gseguin> no idea
[11:13:50] <toddparker> odd, right
[11:14:06] <toddparker> i tested 1.0 and it's fine on the list view perf page on ios
[11:15:07] <gseguin> fastclick ?
[11:15:15] <toddparker> takes ~1./2 second to click a link on the perf page
[11:15:21] <toddparker> in 1.0.1
[11:15:25] <toddparker> just tested it
[11:15:38] <toddparker> on 1.1.0, it takes 5-10 seconds
[11:15:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OKOK, and with the line commented out?
[11:15:53] <toddparker> maybe a change in core?
[11:16:02] <gseguin> that's the time before you get the visual feedback
[11:16:03] <toddparker> i need to re-test that
[11:16:10] <gseguin> or the time before it changes page?
[11:16:12] <toddparker> no, navigate
[11:16:28] <toddparker> in 1.1 it takes 3-5 seconds to flip to active and the same to nav
[11:16:43] <johnbender> brutal
[11:16:45] <gseguin> right
[11:17:03] <toddparker> gseguin: give it a try and be amazed
[11:17:05] <toddparker> ya
[11:17:08] <johnbender> I don't think we're going to solve it here though, do we have enough info for everyone who wants to get involved?
[11:17:15] * johnbender is being super time snipey
[11:17:25] <toddparker> that issue has all the details
[11:17:27] <johnbender> *snipe*
[11:17:55] <toddparker> so gseguin will report back today on this
[11:18:07] <toddparker> next
[11:18:08] <toddparker> blinky transitions in PhoneGap (re-opened for review) - Todd tested latest in a webview and doesn’t seem blinky, even with fixed toolbars but only tested with fade. More investigation needed
[11:18:17] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4024
[11:18:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4024 on jquery-mobile (elfgoh; 2m, 1w ago): White flash/flicker when transiting between 2 web pages in Phonegap
[11:18:27] <toddparker> this is a crazy complex issue
[11:18:43] <toddparker> we landed at least one fix for this but there are a ton of comments on this probem
[11:19:01] <johnbender> toddparker: there's a pull request the purports to handle part of the transition blinkyness by preventing the browser history from autoscrolling the page
[11:19:05] <toddparker> when i tested /test/ yesterday with fixed toolbars in a web view, no blinks
[11:19:16] <toddparker> huh, interesting
[11:19:42] <toddparker> given the time, i think the changes in master are quite a bit better than 1.1.0
[11:19:44] <uGoMobi> BTW - that fix that I merged is not in 1.1.1 yet
[11:19:53] <toddparker> ah, that needs to be picked over
[11:20:00] <toddparker> is that the one you asked scott about?
[11:20:02] <uGoMobi> have to wait for scottjehl
[11:20:06] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:20:21] <toddparker> is he the only person who can do it?
[11:20:44] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4560
[11:20:44] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by dcarrith (2d, 17h ago): Issue #4559: Fixing the blink forward/back effect that sometimes happens...
[11:21:08] <toddparker> johnbender: could you try to pick this over to 1.1-stable
[11:21:24] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4535
[11:21:24] <uGoMobi> If he confirms everything regarding transitions needs to be 1.1-stable I can pick his commit(s)
[11:21:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4535 on jquery-mobile (dcarrith; 5d, 3h ago): Call to window.history.back() in click handler of jquery.mobile.navigation.js causes jump down to lastScroll of $to page if going back
[11:21:40] <johnbender> toddparker: pick which?
[11:22:19] <johnbender> toddparker: I think uGoMobi wants to confirm the functionality no?
[11:22:31] <toddparker> ah, that fix from scott on transitions
[11:22:32] <johnbender> I can certainly cherry pick it over though :D
[11:23:28] <uGoMobi> Scott did a few commits and didn't pick one of them, I don't know if that was on purpose
[11:23:31] <toddparker> asking scott j now
[11:23:41] <uGoMobi> I think not, but just wanted to be sure
[11:23:44] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:23:47] <toddparker> uGoMobi: do you have that commit handy?
[11:23:54] <uGoMobi> one sec
[11:24:32] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ff1a7e0
[11:24:32] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (2m, 1d ago): Add a class while the TO page is being set up for show (block display, focus, scrolling, setting height) called ui-page-pre-in. This class sets the opacity of the TO page to 0 during this momentary process, which at least in my testing,  prevents fixed toolbars and pages from flickering during transitions when fixed toolbars are used in a web app mode in iOS (not Safa
[11:24:33] <socialhapy> roved. Addresses, but perhaps doesn't completely fix Issue #4024
[11:25:53] <toddparker> johnbender: I'll test test that fill-mode PR
[11:25:55] <toddparker> https://github.com/dcarrith/jquery-mobile/commit/fbbcf9e16ed2978547f1460c66f533157714371d
[11:25:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by David L. Carrithers (2d, 17h ago): Issue #4559: Fixing the blink forward/back effect that sometimes happens before and after transitions.  This fix will only work in browsers that support animation-fill-mode
[11:26:37] <toddparker> while we wait for that commit from uGoMobi
[11:26:47] <johnbender> toddparker: cool
[11:26:54] <toddparker> the last 3 items for 1.1.1 are done
[11:26:55] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm still talking with him about the scrolling PR
[11:26:55] <toddparker> update page padding - Closed, fixes landed by Jasper
[11:26:56] <toddparker> unable to close dialog in webview - Closed, Bender posted a workaround in the issue
[11:26:57] <toddparker> IE submit button - Closed, fixes landed by Jasper
[11:27:08] <toddparker> ok
[11:27:09] <toddparker> cool
[11:27:13] <johnbender> toddparker: s/workaround/FIX/
[11:27:17] <toddparker> some of these are hard to reproduce
[11:27:35] <toddparker> like testing that css property may only happen with certain conditions
[11:27:47] <toddparker> so for 1.2
[11:27:53] <toddparker> we have the popup stuff
[11:28:12] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[11:28:18] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: I asked johnbender and gseguin to give the code a review since it hasn't had a lot of eyes on it yet
[11:28:31] <johnbender> I went over it with _|Nix|_ before the meeting
[11:28:36] <toddparker> johnbender: cool
[11:28:44] <johnbender> we have one item to discuss afterward
[11:28:50] <gseguin> started to do that a bit yesterday
[11:28:52] <johnbender> which is the stack vs singleton
[11:28:56] <toddparker> are others seeing slowness when opening
[11:29:05] <toddparker> great
[11:29:07] <gseguin> on Chrome / Linux
[11:29:07] <johnbender> toddparker: I didn't have time to look into that
[11:29:13] <toddparker> k
[11:29:18] <gseguin> very slow to open a popup
[11:29:23] <toddparker> if you have an iPad, seems especially slow for some reason
[11:29:29] <toddparker> any ideas why?
[11:29:32] <gseguin> might be my config though
[11:29:37] <gseguin> haven't looked into it
[11:29:52] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: any theories?
[11:30:11] <toddparker> we ca refine perf later, but if we can improve this now, would be a huge win
[11:30:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Not sure.
[11:30:24] <toddparker> ok
[11:30:34] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you and I need to look at some style Q's
[11:30:52] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:31:01] <toddparker> moving on
[11:31:11] <toddparker> gseguin's updates
[11:31:21] <toddparker> More code re-org, moved widgets into widgets directory
[11:31:21] <toddparker> Fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3558
[11:31:22] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3558 on jquery-mobile (simonvane; 4m, 1w ago): Buttons not disabled in internet explorer
[11:31:22] <toddparker> Started looking into popup code
[11:31:23] <toddparker> Getting feedback on download builder UI
[11:31:37] <toddparker> great that the IE disabling is now working
[11:31:39] <toddparker> thanks!
[11:31:50] <gseguin> you're welcome
[11:31:54] <uGoMobi> yeah, nice one!
[11:32:06] <toddparker> anything you want us to discuss on your end?
[11:32:22] <gseguin> the feedback on the builder is mostly ui
[11:32:35] <gseguin> so you or matt can probably help with that
[11:32:37] <toddparker> saw that
[11:32:44] <gseguin> s/matt/mat/
[11:33:05] <toddparker> it's ok to say, het, it's auto-generated and alphabetical
[11:33:24] <toddparker> oh missed the designs tuff
[11:33:26] <toddparker> links?
[11:33:39] * gseguin retrieves link
[11:33:41] <toddparker> k
[11:34:08] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/5
[11:34:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #5 on jquery-mobile-builder (Ruffio; 2h, 10s ago): Dependencies should be clearly marked
[11:34:17] <toddparker> uGoMobi: did you find that commit from Scott? Just don't want to forget it
[11:34:39] <toddparker> ah, saw that one
[11:34:45] <toddparker> is that reasonable to display?
[11:34:54] <toddparker> not sure how crazy that would be
[11:34:57] <uGoMobi> yes, already posted ^^^
[11:34:59] <toddparker> UI doesn't do that
[11:35:04] <toddparker> sorry I missed that uGoMobi
[11:35:07] <gseguin> like I said in the comment, it can get complex
[11:35:10] <uGoMobi> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ff1a7e0
[11:35:10] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (2m, 1d ago): Add a class while the TO page is being set up for show (block display, focus, scrolling, setting height) called ui-page-pre-in. This class sets the opacity of the TO page to 0 during this momentary process, which at least in my testing,  prevents fixed toolbars and pages from flickering during transitions when fixed toolbars are used in a web app mode in iOS (not Safa
[11:35:11] <socialhapy> roved. Addresses, but perhaps doesn't completely fix Issue #4024
[11:35:47] <gseguin> now we could go fancy and represent the dependencies in a tree using something like d3
[11:36:05] <johnbend1r> lawl
[11:36:14] <gseguin> but that would be for a next version
[11:36:16] <johnbend1r> it would be nice to visualize but I think that's overboard
[11:36:20] <uGoMobi> (note the comment of gseguin on that commit)
[11:36:26] <toddparker> confirmed that https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ff1a7e0 should be picked to 1.1-stable

[11:36:31] <toddparker> uGoMobi: mind doing that
[11:36:44] <uGoMobi> ok, will do
[11:36:58] <toddparker> gseguin: agreed
[11:36:58] <toddparker> think the current UI is fine for the first pass
[11:37:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: you might have to check your grunt fixes again after I picked that one
[11:37:33] <toddparker> cool
[11:37:33] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: there's no linting on 1.1-stable
[11:37:38] <johnbend1r> I didn't even bother
[11:37:49] <toddparker> ok, johnbender - what's up with you
[11:37:58] <johnbend1r> just the stuff in the doc
[11:38:06] <johnbend1r> talked with the other ci folks today
[11:38:07] <johnbend1r> earlier
[11:38:17] <johnbend1r> everyone is interested in the perf regression testing
[11:38:24] <johnbend1r> apparently we're friends with the jsperf folks
[11:38:26] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:38:31] * johnbend1r thinks it's nice to be a cool kid
[11:38:43] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:38:45] <johnbend1r> base tag stuff/testswarm stuff is next
[11:38:57] <johnbend1r> but I need to start work on my preso today
[11:39:00] <johnbend1r> so I'll  be in and out
[11:39:09] <johnbend1r> oh
[11:39:11] <johnbend1r> and linting is in on master
[11:39:16] <johnbend1r> and we already caught on issue :D
[11:39:20] <johnbend1r> *one
[11:39:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: "in"?
[11:39:42] <johnbend1r> "in" == "landed"
[11:39:46] <johnbend1r> it's in the code base
[11:39:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: OK.
[11:39:54] <johnbend1r> </stuff-thast-up>
[11:39:55] <uGoMobi> need subtitles too _|Nix|_  ? ;-)
[11:39:56] <toddparker> cool
[11:40:07] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:40:30] <toddparker> johnbender's summary for reference
[11:40:30] <toddparker> Linting is done, caught one bug
[11:40:30] <toddparker> Perf testing
[11:40:30] <toddparker> apparently we know the jsperf folks
[11:40:30] <toddparker> steal the scheme
[11:40:31] <toddparker> benchmarkjs.com
[11:40:31] <toddparker> Popup
[11:40:32] <toddparker> code reviewed
[11:40:32] <toddparker> tweaks to follow
[11:40:33] <toddparker> discussion on popup stacks
[11:40:33] <toddparker> Preso work this week
[11:40:34] <toddparker> Base tag issues next
[11:40:56] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: anything to add other than those proposals?
[11:41:01] * johnbend1r slams his gavel with a loud CRACK!
[11:41:02] <johnbend1r> NEXT!
[11:41:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I totally forgot what those proposals were.
[11:41:27] <_|Nix|_> Oh, the buttonMarkup corners ...
[11:41:34] <toddparker> heh
[11:41:37] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, well, once we have good perf stuff ...
[11:41:38] <toddparker> ya
[11:41:56] <_|Nix|_> Although adding the corners should be no big deal, because it's just a hash lookup.
[11:42:12] <toddparker> those seem like they should be considered for 1.3
[11:42:12] <toddparker> maybe we can wait?
[11:42:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Noooo - that's super trivial stuff.
[11:42:37] <agcolom> someone has opened an issue to ask for the same thing as I did (1st proposal): https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4565
[11:42:37] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4565 on jquery-mobile (AlexHowansky; 2d, 1h ago): Popups can not be defined outside the page they're used in.
[11:43:02] <johnbend1r> can we add that to the popup discussion afterward?
[11:43:08] <toddparker> sure
[11:43:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: Let's do that.
[11:43:10] <johnbend1r> it falls into the "how complex should this be"
[11:43:23] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[11:43:32] <toddparker> yeah
[11:43:41] <toddparker> ok, let's talk after this
[11:44:00] <toddparker> so Jasper closed a bunch of stuff already mentioned
[11:44:05] <toddparker> one item of note:
[11:44:06] <toddparker> Created PR to make slider widget independent from textinput widget
[11:44:07] <toddparker> Q: do all widgets need to be completely independent, also the CSS? (all button CSS in core?)
[11:44:30] <johnbend1r> as much as possible that would be nice
[11:44:34] <toddparker> I think the CSS should be decoupled so it fits 1:1 with the widget if possible
[11:44:44] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:44:53] <uGoMobi> except for the button CSS I suppose
[11:44:55] <johnbend1r> don't go super duper crazy and kill yourself to get it done
[11:45:00] <toddparker> think the slider could have the text input as a dependency
[11:45:05] <johnbend1r> that's the ideal we're shooting for
[11:45:07] <uGoMobi> because so many component use that
[11:45:12] <toddparker> but the CSS for the input and slider are separate concerns
[11:45:51] <toddparker> cool. so you have an answer then
[11:46:03] <toddparker> let's look at popup styling soon
[11:46:10] <uGoMobi> not sure about the slider input
[11:46:23] <toddparker> no?
[11:46:28] <uGoMobi> there is a bit of css for that in the slider css
[11:46:48] <uGoMobi> but most of the css and all js is in textwidget
[11:46:59] <uGoMobi> so it is a mix of both
[11:47:04] <toddparker> I think the base styles for the input should be input css
[11:47:24] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:47:30] <toddparker> but it's ok for the slider css to have overrides for inputs when used within a slider since it's an aggregate widget
[11:47:36] <toddparker> make sense?
[11:47:46] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:47:51] <uGoMobi> clear
[11:48:00] <toddparker> cool
[11:48:02] <uGoMobi> then it is ok right now and i just close that pr
[11:48:12] <toddparker> ah, ok. one less PR then!
[11:48:18] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:48:28] <toddparker> ok, agcolom
[11:48:42] <agcolom> Met with Todd and Richard on 15th June to get all setup to produce the new website
[11:48:42] <agcolom>     19 PRs and 18 commits on the docs.
[11:48:42] <agcolom>     6 widgets ready in the new api docs (which led to many small corrections in the docs).
[11:48:42] <agcolom>     Small amount of triage and testing
[11:48:44] <toddparker> Met with Todd and Richard on 15th June to get all setup to produce the new website
[11:48:52] <toddparker> ^^ think it's on me right now
[11:48:54] <toddparker> right?
[11:48:59] <agcolom> ok
[11:49:07] <agcolom> yes
[11:49:08] <toddparker> nice job keeping up on the docs - 19 PRs and 18 commits on the docs.
[11:49:21] <toddparker> 6 widgets ready in the new api docs
[11:49:26] <toddparker> that is huge
[11:49:44] <toddparker> anything you need to discuss?
[11:49:52] <agcolom> what is taking time is correcting all the little things discovered while doing that
[11:50:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Amen!
[11:50:18] <_|Nix|_> Side-quests FTW!
[11:50:22] <agcolom> not really... If someone can check the dialog api docs to check I haven't done anything wrong
[11:51:08] <toddparker> yeah, this is a very good activity to make sure things are 100% right
[11:51:12] <agcolom> (We haven't got the new format for dialogs in the current docs (with options, events,etc) so I looked at the code
[11:51:24] <toddparker> ok

[11:53:28] <toddparker> he's lacking in the other devices department
[11:53:39] <toddparker> so, for the releases
[11:53:51] <JasonDScott> i do have a ipad 2 to test with too
[11:53:57] <toddparker> wondering how close the timing is going to be
[11:54:09] <toddparker> cool JasonDScott, didn't know that
[11:54:15] <gseguin> aren't we ready for 1.1.1rc1?
[11:54:25] <toddparker> I can work on the blog post for 1.1.1rc1
[11:54:31] <toddparker> yes gseguin - i think so
[11:54:34] <johnbend1r> gseguin: hangout?
[11:54:49] <johnbend1r> no beta huh?
[11:54:52] <johnbend1r> rc it is!
[11:55:00] <toddparker> the fire items we discussed still need fixing, but you should ahem the list view stuff in good shape
[11:55:11] <toddparker> let's wrap up here

[11:55:48] <johnbend1r> blarg
[11:55:52] <johnbend1r> we need to talk about this soon
[11:55:53] <toddparker> I may hop on the hangout but pause for a bit ok?
[11:55:57] <johnbend1r> kk
[11:55:59] <johnbend1r> sounds good
[11:55:59] <jseguin> with devices getting larger and larger in resolution do we have any plans for scaling?

[11:56:54] <jseguin> oh okay great!
[11:57:04] <toddparker> does that answer your Q?

[11:57:18] <_|Nix|_> OK - just to get this out of the way: You guys are not related, right?
[11:57:20] <toddparker> ok
[11:57:39] <jseguin> hmm I don't think so, but you never know we could be

[11:58:42] <toddparker> cool

[11:59:01] <toddparker> gseguin: mind posting a link in the dog channel
[11:59:11] <toddparker> think we could discuss on the hangout
[11:59:16] <toddparker> maybe hop in in 15?
