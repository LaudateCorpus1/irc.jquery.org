[11:01:04] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:01:10] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:17] <toddparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting now
[11:01:32] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:01:35] <toddparker> hi all
[11:01:45] <toddparker> sound off if you're here
[11:02:16] * _|Nix|_ waves
[11:02:23] <toddparker> :)
[11:02:33] <toddparker> johnbender, agcolom, gseguin
[11:02:37] <johnbender> hey
[11:02:39] <toddparker> etc.
[11:02:40] <toddparker> hey
[11:03:12] <toddparker> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7KsL1TBK-nRPPy9G84TARGFE188Avoe4ogHMJ1oaoU/edit#
[11:03:20] <toddparker> ok, i'll start off
[11:03:42] <toddparker> 1.1.1 beta final - released today
[11:03:43] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/07/12/jqm-1-1-1/
[11:03:50] <toddparker> great work everyone!
[11:03:58] <toddparker> we're definitely going to do a 1.1.2
[11:04:04] * _|Nix|_ throws confetti
[11:04:09] <toddparker>  so i created a new milestone in the tracker
[11:04:58] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:05:39] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[11:05:40] <toddparker> Download builder - released
[11:05:53] <toddparker> gseguin just updated it to 1.1.1 just now
[11:06:45] <toddparker> device donation page is up and linked: http://jquerymobile.com/donate-devices/
[11:07:25] <toddparker> so now we can focus on 1.2
[11:07:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Intel is linked in the blog post as "http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/07/12/jqm-1-1-1/www.intel.com" - a broken link.
[11:07:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You probably forgot to prefix it http://
[11:07:38] <toddparker> boo, i'll fix
[11:07:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: NP.
[11:07:43] <toddparker> ya
[11:07:47] <toddparker> thanks
[11:08:10] <toddparker> for 1.2 I'll have a detailed thank you list. scott_gonzalez is helping to generate that
[11:08:46] <toddparker> so _|Nix|_ - where are we at with popup nav and android?
[11:08:52] <toddparker> (thanks for jamming on this btw)
[11:09:07] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I think you mispelled Maurice his name (if you gonna make corrections)
[11:09:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That's fixed.
[11:09:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Can I go next then?
[11:09:40] <toddparker> sure!
[11:09:59] <_|Nix|_> OK, so: Working on the wonky URLs issue now.
[11:10:11] <_|Nix|_> Need to discuss popup centering and resizing.
[11:10:47] <_|Nix|_> Need to discuss whether we want to lend a hand to people navigating with changePage( url, { changeHash: false } );
[11:11:15] <_|Nix|_> Actually the wonky URLs issue should be OK now.
[11:11:18] <toddparker> so with that off, what happens?
[11:11:33] <toddparker> do we add the hash when a popup opens?
[11:11:50] <toddparker> i'd imagine back wouldn't close it, but that's just the deal
[11:11:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Pages get added to urlHistory, but not to the browser history, so they get skipped over when going back and forward.
[11:12:36] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: THe problem is this: You add a page with changeHash: false, open a dialog or a popup, and when it closes, you're back to the last page that had changeHash: true, not to the correct page (because that one was added with changeHash: false).
[11:12:37] <johnbender> is that a documented option?
[11:12:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: changeHash: false? I'd imagine so, since people are using it.
[11:13:15] <johnbender> hrm
[11:13:21] <toddparker> that sort of works as expected
[11:13:32] <johnbender> giving people a way to break the back button
[11:13:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: gseguin was of the opinion that we change nothing - tell people that, while possible, we do not lend navigation support.
[11:13:40] <toddparker> if we're not listening to hash change, the back button would work that way
[11:13:56] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah. You're right.
[11:14:05] <johnbender> how would the back button work?
[11:14:24] <MauriceG> Hi!  Sorry late... was out
[11:14:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I made a nifty UTF-8 diagram in the agenda.
[11:14:38] <toddparker> saw that _|Nix|_
[11:14:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Not sure if that's worth implementing though.
[11:14:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I thought toddparker was saying it would work now with hashlistening disabled
[11:14:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It would make dialogs and popups behave less surprisingly.
[11:15:11] <toddparker> nah
[11:15:17] <johnbender> how do we even track a back button press without a hashchange event?
[11:15:31] <toddparker> i'm saying that if you turn off that feature, you're stuck with whatever the browser does
[11:15:40] <toddparker> i don't think so
[11:15:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yes, but the bug reporter wants us to use the no-hash-listening behaviour in the hash-listening case as well - /if/ the dialog/popup is opened off a page that was itself added with changeHash: false.
[11:16:04] <johnbender> :/
[11:16:14] <toddparker> sheesh
[11:16:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: changeHash: false pages become "children" of the last changeHash: true page.
[11:16:22] <johnbender> tradeoff
[11:16:34] <toddparker> i'm going to say this isn't a critical thing for us to deal with for alpha
[11:16:38] <johnbender> I can't imagine this being worth it as a matter of complexity
[11:16:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't believe it's worth implementing.
[11:16:41] <toddparker> or maybe even 1.2
[11:16:46] <toddparker> +1
[11:16:46] <johnbender> in the same way we do weird things with dialogs
[11:16:48] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[11:16:54] <_|Nix|_> Feature request, IMO.
[11:17:32] <_|Nix|_> OK, so that's about it.
[11:17:44] <toddparker> ok
[11:17:46] <toddparker> cool
[11:17:55] <toddparker> so android 2.3 should be ok with this commit?
[11:17:56] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/332fc42d2bcca8abfe068e064c0935052b5ede7c
[11:18:01] <toddparker> and the newer ones, right?
[11:18:01] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Gabriel Schulhof (20h, 44m ago): [navigation] Emit new signal "navigate" from _handleHashChange
[11:18:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The next one, actually.
[11:18:16] <toddparker> i have zach testing popups in master now across a lot of platforms
[11:18:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: This one merely lays the foundation.
[11:18:35] <uGoMobi> nice job
[11:18:45] <toddparker> cool
[11:18:52] <toddparker> there are a few commits
[11:18:56] <toddparker> i'll mark as resolved
[11:19:02] <toddparker> was there an issue #?
[11:19:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Oh, there was an issue?
[11:19:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I just filed the issue in my brain - I thought.
[11:19:29] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:19:29] <toddparker> k
[11:19:51] <toddparker> the only other major item was the centered in the window option
[11:19:59] <toddparker> not sure we're at with that
[11:20:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah - what should be the syntax?
[11:20:13] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4659
[11:20:14] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4659 on jquery-mobile (Sathis; 3d, 8h ago): Popup widget not showing in Android 2.3.5
[11:20:34] <toddparker> we can close and link to those commits
[11:20:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That may actually be a different issue.
[11:20:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Let me look at it.
[11:20:48] <toddparker> ok
[11:20:53] <uGoMobi> k
[11:20:53] <_|Nix|_> I'll close it if it is indeed that issue.
[11:20:58] <toddparker> so let's decide on the center option
[11:21:21] <toddparker> thinking that data-position is the name
[11:21:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I was thinking data-center="link|window"
[11:21:49] <toddparker> eventually the api may cover all the UI position utility features
[11:22:04] <toddparker> that's why I was thinking of using that name
[11:22:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That'll introduce a small language inside that one parameter.
[11:22:21] <toddparker> small language?
[11:22:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The value of the attribute is very complicated to parse.
[11:22:47] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Might as well make it json.
[11:22:54] <agcolom> i like data-position too
[11:22:58] <toddparker> oh, i see what you mean
[11:23:21] <toddparker> position has a more more complex syntax and overloading might not be a good idea
[11:24:04] <toddparker> i can see how center seems more direct but it may limit us
[11:24:14] <toddparker> position seems more neutral
[11:24:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If we're gonna position relative to anything other than the link, the attr needs to include a selector.
[11:24:37] <agcolom> data-center just makes me think of a data center!
[11:24:41] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:24:45] <toddparker> UI position is very rich: http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[11:24:47] <toddparker> heh
[11:25:10] <uGoMobi> data-popuppos :)
[11:25:20] <toddparker> so you're thinking that this could be any selector?
[11:25:35] <toddparker> i don't want to get to fancy
[11:25:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I dunno, but it's gonna be complicated, because we need to delimit the selector from the position specification - all within one string.
[11:25:58] <toddparker> because as soon as you do that, then people will want other options than just center over X
[11:26:05] <toddparker> above, below, etc.
[11:26:43] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: All very dandy, but we need to cram a selector and a position spec inside one string.
[11:26:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Maybe we should have a data-parent="selector"
[11:26:54] <toddparker> so if we just keep this to a simple option: do you want the popup centered over the link or within the viewport
[11:27:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I dunno - you might be right that that's limiting.
[11:28:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If people wanna do dropdowns, they'll probably want to align to the bottom of the button from the outside.
[11:28:14] <toddparker> in the UI context, this is the "of" option
[11:28:29] <toddparker> right, but if we go that far, we should use position plugin
[11:28:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I know. That's where the selector would go.
[11:28:34] <toddparker> it does everything
[11:29:22] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Not sure whether position prevents the top coordinate from being negative or tries to minimize the amount of height it adds to the document.
[11:29:37] <toddparker> if we implemted position eventually, we might have data-position-at and data-postion-offset
[11:29:39] <toddparker> etc.
[11:30:01] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We need to do a best effort to obey the position spec. We must never place a popup at y < 0
[11:30:08] <toddparker> yes
[11:30:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Dunno if position lets us give such constraints.
[11:30:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Collision looks like something along those lines, but collision with what?
[11:30:43] <toddparker> you can do any position and collision detection scenario with that
[11:31:27] <toddparker> so the question is whether our simple built-in positioning which is barebones should be called -position or something else
[11:32:00] <toddparker> even if we added position support, it would be an optional thing if you wanted to go further than these two options
[11:32:11] <toddparker> think that's reasonable
[11:32:52] <toddparker> edge collision
[11:32:57] <toddparker> sooooo
[11:33:09] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, that's it. No document-edge collision.
[11:33:48] <toddparker> i'm ok with calling this whatever is clearest
[11:33:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is $('.selector').popup('open', x, y); safe? does it prevent y < 0 ?
[11:34:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[11:34:17] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[11:34:23] <toddparker> link and view/viewport/window are the values for this
[11:34:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: x, y are the /desired/ coords. You're not guaranteed to get them.
[11:34:37] <toddparker> right
[11:34:38] <johnbender> s/position/offset/ ?
[11:34:39] <uGoMobi> right
[11:34:47] <toddparker> because you have collision detection
[11:35:23] <toddparker> other than naming, _|Nix|_ do you have Q's or concerns about landing this?
[11:35:36] <toddparker> just trying to make sure i'm tracking each item
[11:35:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Not really. I'll give it a shot.
[11:35:52] <toddparker> oh, ok
[11:36:34] <toddparker> data-position-to="link"
[11:36:38] <toddparker> data-position-to="window"
[11:36:54] <toddparker> dunno what's best
[11:37:08] <toddparker> -to doesn't interfere with the position options
[11:37:14] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... or data-position-to="<selector>"
[11:37:33] <toddparker> if that is easy to add, it would be cool
[11:37:45] <toddparker> so "link" and "window" would be reserved keywords?
[11:37:47] <uGoMobi> +1 for data-position-to
[11:37:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Give me something else instead of "link" because "link" is a valid selector.
[11:37:57] <toddparker> but i could use ".foo"
[11:38:05] <toddparker> right
[11:38:11] <toddparker> it's not a "parent"
[11:38:15] <toddparker> "trigger"
[11:38:18] <agcolom> origin?
[11:38:19] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah. We need to reserve words that are not valid selectors.
[11:38:26] <toddparker> origin is pretty good
[11:38:42] <uGoMobi> +1 for origin
[11:38:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, so "origin"/"window"/selector
[11:38:52] <toddparker> sweet
[11:38:59] <toddparker> selector would be slick
[11:39:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, that's the easy part - and if the selector evaluates to no elements, then it's "window" for ya, buddy!
[11:39:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Oh, and the selector has to be filtered for ":visible"
[11:40:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:40:20] <toddparker> good fallback
[11:40:28] <toddparker> right
[11:40:34] <toddparker> ok, i added this to the notes
[11:41:10] <toddparker> add position option to center the popup over various thing (link, window, selector)
[11:41:11] <toddparker> data-position-to=”origin|window|selector”
[11:41:12] <toddparker> origin is the default (the link you click to open it)
[11:41:21] <toddparker> all the css stuff seems solid not, thanks to uGoMobi
[11:41:33] <toddparker> any big ticket items there?
[11:41:41] <_|Nix|_> OK, so what about the idea that the popup emits an "opening" signal before calculating sizes and deciding on positions?
[11:42:08] <toddparker> sounds good to me
[11:42:13] <_|Nix|_> So, people can scale contents and things before the popup decides where to go ....
[11:42:29] <toddparker> if you change orientations, the positioning gets messed up
[11:42:36] <_|Nix|_> OK - can do. But the signal does not mean one can prevent the popup from opening by preventing default!
[11:42:53] <toddparker> so we should re-calc on throttled resize/orientationchange
[11:43:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, because the popup totally ignores orientation changes - except the overlay.
[11:43:09] <toddparker> johnbender: thoughts?
[11:43:11] <uGoMobi> my question is how easy we want to make it for people to make the popup content scale/fit the window
[11:43:31] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i think we can set a sensible but basic baseline
[11:43:31] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK - need to play with that. Got the gadgets for that too: Andriod 2.3.5, iOS 5.1.1 and WP7
[11:43:42] <toddparker> cool _|Nix|_
[11:43:56] <toddparker> because the popup goes to odd places when switching
[11:43:59] <uGoMobi> CSS is done for 1.2 alpha, but you can't make a large image fit the screen with CSS
[11:44:16] <johnbender> toddparker: on the opening signal?
[11:44:20] <toddparker> we can continue to refine that but sounds like a good start uGoMobi
[11:44:25] <toddparker> ya johnbender
[11:44:29] <johnbender> well it would be "open"
[11:44:30] <uGoMobi> the opening signal will make it possible to do this with a script
[11:44:42] <johnbender> popupopen
[11:44:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's already "opened" when it's all done.
[11:44:51] <johnbender> _trigger( "open" )
[11:45:06] <johnbender> hmm
[11:45:14] <johnbender> that should probably be _trigger( "afteropen")
[11:45:23] <johnbender> I think that's consistent with the other events we have
[11:45:25] * johnbender checks
[11:45:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Might be confusing, since you call .popup( "open" )
[11:45:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hopefully they understand that's a method call
[11:45:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: "popupbeforeopen", "popupafteropen" ?
[11:46:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: "popupafterclose"?
[11:46:11] <uGoMobi> that's consistent with the page events
[11:46:13] <johnbender> yah
[11:46:23] <johnbender> do we need those hooks though?
[11:46:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: [✓]
[11:46:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yes.
[11:46:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's how we know that we can open another popup.
[11:47:10] <johnbender> so just the last one then?
[11:47:25] <toddparker> popupafterclose?
[11:47:34] <johnbender> yah
[11:47:45] <toddparker> _|Nix|_?
[11:47:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah. The other one is from the pre-no-other-popups days.
[11:47:51] <johnbender> I'm just recalling the pain that having all the events in nav has caused us
[11:48:05] <toddparker> it's so simple!
[11:48:21] <johnbender> you end up in this cycle of adding new events after certain bits of code have run
[11:48:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But it's still a good idea to have the other one, because it sums up all the waiting-for-the-hashchange-and-the-transition-to-complete.
[11:48:44] <johnbender> agreed
[11:48:49] <johnbender> for testing if nothing else
[11:48:59] <toddparker> cool, seems decided then
[11:49:07] <johnbender> popupafteropen would be good
[11:49:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and if we go back to the previous policy of allowing one popup from another ...
[11:49:56] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. popupafteropen and popupafterclose is good, but we also need popupbeforeopen now that people want to size the content before it shows up.
[11:50:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: popupbeforeopen is kinda like pagebeforeshow
[11:50:18] <johnbender> when/if we do
[11:50:19] <johnbender> we can add it
[11:50:32] <toddparker> +1
[11:50:40] <toddparker> here's my last but major concern - speed: takes 1-2 seconds to open the most minimal popup on the iPad 3 - feels too slow.
[11:50:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we need popupbeforeopen right now?
[11:51:04] <johnbender> toddparker: I was wondering if that's a function of the overlay being animated?
[11:51:06] <toddparker> i can't tell if this is because of the nav stuff, transitions, etc.
[11:51:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Is that true for other iOS 5.1.1 devices as well?
[11:51:11] <johnbender> total speculation
[11:51:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that is the "opening" event you were referring to right?
[11:51:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[11:51:26] <toddparker> it's pretty laggy in general
[11:51:30] <uGoMobi> yes, so we fire the "opening" event, then you have to add custom script to set the max-height of the container
[11:51:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: johnbender is saying that we should add it when we need to. From what you're saying it sounds like we already need it.
[11:51:48] <toddparker> i think setting the default transition to "none" might be a smart idea
[11:52:00] <toddparker> transitions + overlays slows things down considerably
[11:52:20] <toddparker> so i'd rather have the default be the fastest, simplest and you can jazz it up if needed
[11:52:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: There's only an overlay transition if there's an overlayTheme ...
[11:52:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we need it because without it you can't make content fit the screen
[11:52:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, we need it now.
[11:52:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: why is that?
[11:52:55] <toddparker> the same popup with none is less than 1 second to open
[11:53:03] <toddparker> pop (current default) = 2 seconds
[11:53:18] <_|Nix|_> OK, conclusion: Three events: popupbeforeopen, popupafteropen, popupafterclose.
[11:53:21] <uGoMobi> johnbender: because the popup is positioned absolute
[11:53:29] <uGoMobi> therefor max-height 100% doesn't work
[11:53:44] <uGoMobi> also, the popup container has class ui-body-x
[11:53:47] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, having a transition causes the delay? Weird!
[11:53:58] <toddparker> they always do, on pages too
[11:54:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so the idea is that they can retrieve the width/height and remove content as needed?
[11:54:12] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... OK ...
[11:54:13] <uGoMobi> which means bg + border   ... so setting padding doesn't work eiter
[11:54:13] <johnbender> err
[11:54:17] <uGoMobi> either*
[11:54:18] <johnbender> relative to the screen size?
[11:54:24] <toddparker> probably because it needs to kick in hardware acceleration on the objects
[11:55:17] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes, when that event fires you can get the screen height and do .css( max-height, y);
[11:55:20] <_|Nix|_> OK. Will change default to "none".
[11:55:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: won't that just hide content?
[11:55:59] <johnbender> in the best case?
[11:56:01] <_|Nix|_> I was just gonna say ...
[11:56:21] <johnbender> I guess I'm just wondering what the user would actually have to do in the case where the content is large than the screen in a popup
[11:56:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You can $( "img" ).attr( "width", ... ); $( "img" ).attr( "height" ) too ...
[11:56:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes it hides content
[11:56:26] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: think that's an easy and effective first step
[11:56:44] <johnbender> k
[11:56:54] <toddparker> johnbender: if the popup content is large, you can scroll the page
[11:56:58] <johnbender> it doesn't seem like a solvable problem
[11:57:05] <uGoMobi> see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html photo portrait example at the bottom (use FF or other non-webkit browser)
[11:57:09] <johnbender> toddparker: in which case we wouldn't need the event right?
[11:57:26] <toddparker> not for text/forms, no
[11:57:36] <johnbender> ok
[11:57:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think the idea is that the solution depends on the content, so we have to leave it up to devs.
[11:57:55] <toddparker> unless you wanted to set the height of the popup to fit onscreen and use overflow (where supported) but that's not advisable
[11:58:02] <johnbender> right
[11:58:04] <toddparker> really, this is for things like images, maps, videos
[11:58:07] <johnbender> kk
[11:58:08] <johnbender> yah
[11:58:13] <johnbender> alight
[11:58:14] <toddparker> that can be squished
[11:58:15] <johnbender> *alright
[11:58:16] <johnbender> 3 events it is
[11:58:24] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:58:38] <johnbender> lets make sure to state the purpose of each clearly so they aren't misused if we want to change them
[11:58:50] <johnbender> at least then we can always point back to the docs when we move things around
[11:58:50] <toddparker> yes please
[11:59:01] <toddparker> so what are our events?
[11:59:20] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: can you make tickets for each of these? center option, events, etc.
[11:59:26] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK.
[12:00:10] <toddparker> events will be: "popupbeforeopen", "popupafteropen" and "popupafterclose"
[12:00:12] <toddparker> right?
[12:00:15] <_|Nix|_> Correct.
[12:00:56] <toddparker> ok, in the google doc
[12:00:59] <toddparker> thanks
[12:01:15] <toddparker> back to perf, any other ideas on how to speed these up?
[12:01:38] <toddparker> guessing we need to bind to click, not the vclick
[12:01:46] <toddparker> so we have that 300ms delay
[12:02:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: One more thing: There's that nagging link back to popup.js in nav, because of the call to handleLink ...
[12:02:26] <toddparker> i'd like to do some hardcore profiling after alpha to see if we can improve this
[12:02:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Do we add popup as a dep of nav?
[12:02:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we have to but we talked about ways around that
[12:02:51] <toddparker> mesh, rather not
[12:02:55] <toddparker> popup is pretty heavy
[12:03:15] <toddparker> i'd try to avoid that at all costs
[12:03:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, but, IIRC, we tabled it.
[12:03:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We were thinking about making the click handler pluggable.
[12:04:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Do I see another event on the horizon?
[12:04:28] <johnbender> no
[12:04:29] <johnbender> :D
[12:05:01] <johnbender> I gues I'd be interested to see if you can just disable the link handling for popup links
[12:05:10] <johnbender> and do youre own
[12:05:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's what I had before.
[12:05:30] <toddparker> as a power user option?
[12:05:35] <johnbender> no
[12:05:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But then they can't have a href.
[12:05:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/232114
[12:05:44] <johnbender> nav depends on popup right now
[12:05:51] <johnbender> which is bad
[12:06:05] <toddparker> we need to handle links within popups via the nav system
[12:06:13] <toddparker> agree on the badness
[12:06:25] <toddparker> why the sep? sorry, not up to speed
[12:06:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: nav depends on page - popup behaves like a page.
[12:06:29] <toddparker> dep
[12:06:32] <johnbender> its links _to_ popups that are in the nav code
[12:07:02] <toddparker> as in a deep link to a popup?
[12:07:08] <johnbender> no
[12:07:11] <johnbender> just a link
[12:07:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_ had it right
[12:07:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If you click on any link in jqm it goes through the click router.
[12:07:24] <toddparker> right
[12:07:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: To avoid that, you need to add your own click handler and remove the href.
[12:07:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That's bad.
[12:07:53] <toddparker> but why is a link inside a popup different from one in a page
[12:08:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: have you tried binding to pagebeforechange and preventing default?
[12:08:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It's not about links inside popups.
[12:08:13] <toddparker> ah, ok
[12:08:14] <johnbender> toddparker: it's about links _TO_ popups
[12:08:24] <toddparker> links TO popups. gotcha
[12:08:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. I'll try again.
[12:08:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that should work
[12:08:59] <johnbender> since nearly nothing happens before that's fired
[12:09:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[12:09:14] <johnbender> not sure you get enough information in the call though
[12:09:18] <toddparker> worth solving for sure
[12:09:36] <toddparker> this one may be something we can tackle after alpha though
[12:09:45] <toddparker> but before 1.2 rc
[12:09:50] <johnbender> true
[12:09:53] <toddparker> just throwing that out there
[12:10:07] <johnbender> that's a pretty crazy dep tree though :(
[12:10:07] <toddparker> since it's more of an optimization on dependencies
[12:10:11] <_|Nix|_> OKOK - so I'll deal with this after all the other stuff.
[12:10:17] <toddparker> +1
[12:10:22] <johnbender> especially with the goal of making bits like nav available seperately
[12:10:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Definitely.
[12:11:34] <toddparker> cool
[12:11:39] <toddparker> so i know we already are over
[12:11:48] <toddparker> so let's try to wrap
[12:11:51] <_|Nix|_> Things keep popping up.
[12:12:01] <toddparker> anything important to hash out here/now?
[12:12:07] * johnbender falls out of his chair
[12:12:09] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: yeah, it's complicated
[12:12:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: zing :P
[12:12:21] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:12:25] <_|Nix|_> LOL :)
[12:13:02] <_|Nix|_> I'm good - I think.
[12:13:10] <johnbender> same
[12:13:10] <toddparker> cool
[12:13:16] <agcolom> thanks for the nice mention on the blog
[12:13:16] <johnbender> toddparker: preso stuff this week
[12:13:17] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I wonder who is going to work on the fixed toolbar issues
[12:13:18] <johnbender> and next
[12:13:20] <toddparker> just scanned everyone's updates
[12:13:25] <toddparker> seems straightforward
[12:13:34] <toddparker> ok johnbender
[12:13:35] <johnbender> toddparker: and I'm leaving for OSCON on weds
[12:13:44] <johnbender> and Throne
[12:14:00] <toddparker> johnbender: will you be able to help with the build stuff next week and next if needed?
[12:14:15] <johnbender> toddparker: hopefully
[12:14:30] <toddparker> i'll try to give you lots of warning as we get closer to 1.2
[12:14:31] <johnbender> shouldn't be too much work
[12:14:33] <johnbender> kk
[12:14:35] <toddparker> nah
[12:14:47] <toddparker> uGoMobi: the android fixed stuff is really critical
[12:15:04] <toddparker> so if you think you and i could jam on that, let's do it
[12:15:15] <toddparker> do you have some android test devices
[12:15:17] <uGoMobi> yes, I really don't know how we can fix it
[12:15:27] <toddparker> seems like 2.3, chrome are all problems
[12:15:29] <uGoMobi> so would need lots of help
[12:15:34] <toddparker> yeah…not sure either
[12:15:39] <toddparker> but let's give it a look
[12:15:52] <toddparker> maybe we'll get lucky
[12:16:20] <toddparker> frankly, if android is totally busted we might need to kick them out of fixed toolbars but that's a ways off
[12:16:31] <toddparker> i'll try to get scottjehl to help out too
[12:16:43] <uGoMobi> yeah that would be great
[12:16:55] <toddparker> next week, if you can help me collect all these into the 1.1.2 milestone we can start tinkering
[12:17:05] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that's right!
[12:17:10] <toddparker> we need to do some trial and error mad scientist stuff here
[12:17:12] <_|Nix|_> Thanks for bringing up 1.1.2
[12:17:13] <uGoMobi> milestone 1.1.1. --> 1.1.2?
[12:17:21] <_|Nix|_> We should push the wonky URL stuff to 1.1.2 ...
[12:17:35] <_|Nix|_> That's also affected.
[12:17:37] <_|Nix|_> Dialogs.
[12:17:44] <toddparker> yeah
[12:17:55] <toddparker> well 1.1.1 is out the door so it should be in 1.1.2
[12:17:57] <_|Nix|_> OK ... making a note.
[12:18:00] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[12:18:05] <toddparker> maybe sure the tickets are tagged to that
[12:18:16] <uGoMobi> yeah, but maybe you want to move some to 1.2 instead of 1.1.2
[12:18:24] <toddparker> is the repo all set for us to now continue to cherry pick over for 1.1.2
[12:18:36] <_|Nix|_> I think so.
[12:18:36] <toddparker> yeah, right uGoMobi
[12:18:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We've already done some cherry-picking.
[12:18:51] <toddparker> anything that we can back port for 1.1.2, we should
[12:18:55] <toddparker> these are nasty issues
[12:18:55] <uGoMobi> I hope so becuase I already picked mine into 1.1-stable today
[12:19:01] <toddparker> heh. cool
[12:19:24] <toddparker> great. think things look really solid
[12:19:38] <toddparker> thanks everyone for all the hard work. this stuff is tricky business.
[12:20:05] <toddparker> ok, any last questions from anyone on the team?
[12:20:09] <toddparker> questions from the community?
[12:20:14] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Tell me about it. I was breathless for nigh on 5 minutes when I found that FF12 eats hashchange events just like Android 2.3.5
[12:20:21] <toddparker> ugh
[12:20:36] <toddparker> too many bugs
[12:20:49] <toddparker> the web is wild and wooly place.
[12:20:58] <toddparker> guess that makes our job that much more important
[12:21:01] <uGoMobi> :D
[12:21:13] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: No doubt - and coming from a native application development background, doubly so for me.
[12:21:28] <toddparker> yeah, the web must be a rude awakening
[12:21:43] <_|Nix|_> I'm not complaining though - lots of fun.
[12:21:46] <toddparker> i grew up on this wackiness. never knew the comfort of a controlled environment.
[12:21:58] <toddparker> bug wrangling.
[12:22:16] <toddparker> alright everyone, wrapping up and grabbing some lunch
[12:22:18] <_|Nix|_> You're about to show me you scar, aren't you - you know - /that/ one ;)
[12:22:27] <toddparker> hee
[12:22:29] <toddparker> GO TEAM
[12:22:32] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:22:33] <toddparker> thanks all
[12:22:39] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[12:22:50] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:22:56] <agcolom> thanks
