[08:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> ping gnarf jzaefferer kborchers
[09:01:01] <kborchers> hey, grabbing coffee brb
[09:01:28] <jzaefferer> here here
[09:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> I've been mainly focusing on docs for the past week.
[09:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> I've got all projects using the same XSL
[09:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> And I removed the need for preprocessing.
[09:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> Landed support for <signature> in widget methods.
[09:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> And @added, @deprecated, @removed everywhere.
[09:03:11] * rwaldron rejoices
[09:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm currently working on widget factory docs.
[09:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> Making progress on that, but it's a bit of a pain to document the base widget: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/widget/
[09:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to get the design finalized and iplemented.
[09:05:04] <kborchers> +1
[09:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to bring that up in today's dev leads meeting.
[09:05:27] <kborchers> i can help with that if i know exactly what we want things to look like. that's been my struggle
[09:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit is already live and hopefully UI will be live in 1-2 weeks.
[09:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> So it's pretty high priority.
[09:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we need to get the designers working on this.
[09:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> They didn't have nearly enough info when they were tasked with providing the design for the API sites.
[09:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> They weren't informed that there were half a dozen types of documentation pages.
[09:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: If I can get confirmation from the designers that the design for method pages won't change based on the yet-to-be-designed widget pages, then you could start on that.
[09:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> Since they've already delivered that.
[09:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> And we should be able to work form the method page to implement selector and property pages.
[09:08:54] <kborchers> yep, just let me know
[09:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> They should be pretty similar.
[09:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll ping the designers about that again today as well.
[09:09:35] <kborchers> thanks
[09:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers is making good progress on download builder.
[09:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> He said he can't make the meeting, but provided an update:
[09:10:14] <scott_gonzalez>  Completed the Builder Unit Test: it tests several combinations of component selection and make sure the expected files are added to the package. It also makes sure non-selected component files are NOT added.
[09:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> And he has PRs for:
[09:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> Added release version to frontend. (this was quite simple. More work is yet to come when we offer users the possibility to pick a release between some options)
[09:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> Cleanup. We've made a complete file/naming reorganization. Much more clear now, and some common functionalities have been encapsulated into classes. Easier to grow and maintain.
[09:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> ThemeRoller [partial], backend is about 60% completed, frontend 0%.
[09:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> He expects to have the TR backend finished this week.
[09:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> Then he'll write tests for it and move on to the front-end.
[09:12:51] <jzaefferer> the 60% backend is probably not realistic, unless he has more code for image processing written that isn't in a PR yet
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps. He didn't mention details.
[09:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> The designers started working on jqueryui.com last week, but I haven't seen any commits yet.
[09:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping them about that too to find out where we stand with that.
[09:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone want to tackle auto-generating a TOC for the upgrade guide?
[09:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I'll get back to that after the API doc updates.
[09:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> It involves taking the tokens generated by the markdown lexer and inserting the anchors for each header, then generating the actual TOC.
[09:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone's interested, just let me know.
[09:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.23 was released with proper support for jQuery 1.8.0.
[09:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to do another pre-release for 1.9.0.
[09:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> Either beta.2 or rc.1
[09:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's been 2 months since beta.1 and since then we've landed bug fixes, upgraded to jQuery 1.8.0 and jQuery Color 2.0.0.
[09:19:15] <jzaefferer> both seem fine
[09:19:15] <kborchers> if we do another beta then an rc won't we be late for our final?
[09:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> Probably, but I don't know if we can release in 1 week anyway.
[09:20:15] <kborchers> yeah
[09:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> Though beta.2, rc.1 an final would be like one week apart each if we did another beta.
[09:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's do rc.1
[09:20:54] <kborchers> +1
[09:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few bugs I'd like for us to look at first.
[09:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8515 - Datepicker i18n encoding
[09:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's a legit bug, should be really easy to fix.
[09:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to replace HTML entities with the actual characters.
[09:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone want to own that?
[09:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/555 - Sortable nested lists
[09:22:38] <kborchers> i can take it the datepicker bug
[09:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> This PR has been open for 8 months, but has been ignored since it's an interaction.
[09:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's apparently been tested by a lot of people, so we should review and land.
[09:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> I can take that.
[09:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8363 and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8364 are both about autocomplete on Blackberry.
[09:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> Kris can you look at those?
[09:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> I know you've been working with Blackberry devices :-)
[09:24:47] <kborchers> yeah, i can give them a shot. i only have a playbook so it may be different than a bb
[09:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:25:09] <kborchers> i'll assign to me and see how it goes
[09:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> I have one or two devices I can test with as well.
[09:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6031 I'm not sure about
[09:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably ask the core team if they know what's going on.
[09:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's just annoying to have this one still open.
[09:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> I can talk to core about that.
[09:27:03] <kborchers> lol applet
[09:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> yeah :-/
[09:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> It may not even be relevant anymore with new versions of Firefox.
[09:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that's everything.
[09:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:29:14] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything we're missing for the final release?
[09:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> Code is essentially done.
[09:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> We're working on jqueryui.com, api.jqueryui.com, download.jqueryui.com.
[09:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> Still a few minor tweaks to make in the release script, but it's fully functional.
[09:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Upgrade guide is complete, we can release without the TOC if we need to.
[09:31:52] <jzaefferer> yeah, pretty much
[09:32:02] <jzaefferer> most of that stuff can continue to improve after a release
[09:32:15] <jzaefferer> its just the actual code that kinda freezes
[09:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's try as hard as we can to hit the end of the month target.
[09:32:54] <scott_gonzalez> We'll probably miss by a few days, but it'd be awesome if we could launch before BrazilJS.
[09:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> Richard is giving a keynote on the 30th.
[09:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> So if everything is launched, he can show it off :-)
[09:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> Back to -dev.
