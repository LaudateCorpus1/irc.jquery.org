[12:02:00] <scott_gonzalez_> arschmitz fnagel jzaefferer
[12:02:10] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:11] <fnagel> hey guys
[12:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on getting our tests green.
[12:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> Been going slow since nobody ever reviews PRs :-P
[12:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> But we're getting there... http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryui
[12:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> I've been fixing bugs and working through the PRs.
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping to get us down to 0 PRs in a few weeks.
[12:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> At which point we can switch to standard.
[12:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to simplify our build process and onboard more people.
[12:08:07] <fnagel> switch to standard?
[12:08:11] <arschmitz> lol
[12:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to follow up the release announcement with a request for new committers.
[12:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://standardjs.com/
[12:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how you feel about the jQuery style guide, but the rest of the team is not a fan ;-)
[12:10:19] <fnagel> Alwayses use the jquery CGL for JS in my projects. Even introduced this for a few exrternal companies :-D
[12:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> I used to do that too, but it just go so annoying.
[12:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> Especially after I started playing with other styles in a few smaller projects.
[12:11:07] <fnagel> I'm a fan of readable code -- no matter which ruleset, I'm happy as long there is one...
[12:11:11] <arschmitz> yea i was not sure on standard til i tried it
[12:11:40] <fnagel> is it somehow specific?
[12:11:57] <fnagel> or just differs to our rules
[12:12:01] <fnagel> ?
[12:12:10] <arschmitz> the biggest thing in it is no semi colons
[12:12:24] <arschmitz> get rid of all the spaces
[12:12:34] <fnagel> no semicolon?
[12:12:39] <fnagel> ok, i hate it
[12:12:42] <arschmitz> none ever lol
[12:13:10] <fnagel> ugghh, thats just plain wrong
[12:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> heh, fnagel I had the exact same reaction for over a year.
[12:13:34] <arschmitz> same here
[12:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> Once you use it, you realize it's fine.
[12:13:39] <arschmitz> but i got used to it
[12:13:44] <arschmitz> the one thing i dont like
[12:13:45] <fnagel> mhhh
[12:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> There's only one real concern to keep in mind.
[12:13:51] <arschmitz> is that you cant start a line with an array
[12:13:52] <fnagel> sounds just plain wrong
[12:13:54] <arschmitz> to do like
[12:13:59] <fnagel> like some stupid hipster idea
[12:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> Never start a line with a paren or a square bracket.
[12:14:14] <arschmitz> [ 'thing', 'other' ].forEach(...
[12:14:28] <arschmitz> always have to use a temp var
[12:14:32] <arschmitz> that annoys me
[12:14:36] <arschmitz> but other then that i like it
[12:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I don't think you've heard my idea for getting new team members.
[12:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> For a long time, we didn't want people focused on just one component.
[12:16:31] <fnagel> no, just what you said minutes ago
[12:16:57] <fnagel> ...why exactly I'm here if thats the case ;-)
[12:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> Because in the beginning we had a lot of committers with different code styles creating APIs with differences across each component.
[12:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> But we've solved those underlying problems quite a while ago.
[12:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> So I'd like to bring people on and allow them to focus on, and lead, individual components.
[12:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> For example, someone can become the lead for draggable.
[12:18:47] <fnagel> sounds good to me
[12:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> As lead, they have a lot of say in determining use cases that we want to support, what features should exist, what the API should look like, etc.
[12:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> But then we have layers.
[12:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> So the lead for draggable has to work with the lead for interactions.
[12:19:25] <scott_gonzalez> The lead for interactions in ensuring that all interaction plugins work in a consistent way.
[12:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> And that they work well together.
[12:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> The interaction lead is working with the lead for all widgets.
[12:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> So the categories we have today are core, interactions, widgets, and effects.
[12:21:20] <fnagel> thats sounds a little obvious but I get the thing with having leads for specific sections
[12:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> Those have been our categories forever. I don't think we need to change anything there.
[12:21:28] <scott_gonzalez> But we'd have a role for each of those, plus a role for each individual component.
[12:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> Someone can obviously lead many things.
[12:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> So maybe the interaction lead, draggable lead, and sortable lead would all be the same, but someone else is leading resizable.
[12:22:11] <arschmitz> and until we have people its basicly us on everything lol
[12:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> So before I announce this (which will still be a while), we'll want the existing team members to say which areas they'd like to lead, if any.
[12:22:54] <fnagel> A "individual component" would be what in this context?
[12:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> datepicker, dialog, autocomplete, shake effect, drop effect, etc.
[12:23:32] <fnagel> ahh ok
[12:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> Basically, if there's a checkbox on this page, it would have a lead: http://jqueryui.com/download/
[12:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> If the lead position isn't filled, then it falls on the lead one level up.
[12:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> So let's say that you wanted to lead just datepicker and Alex waned to lead interactions.
[12:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> Since there is no lead for draggable, we'd go up on level to interactions, see Alex and Alex would be the de facto lead for draggable.
[12:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> But that actual position is still open.
[12:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> If someone wants to do something with datepicker, you'd be in charge.
[12:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> But for dialog, we don't have a lead, so we go up to widgets. We don't have a lead there, so we go up to the project as a whole.
[12:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> And we'd find me, so I'd be the de facto lead for dialog.
[12:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> But as soon as we have an actual lead for dialog or widgets, that would no longer bubble up to me.
[12:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> So we'd need to define the roles for the existing members, and then try to fill in as many open spots as possible.
[12:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> I plan on releasing 1.12.2 soon.
[12:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> Just want to make sure we don't have any important bugs before I do.
[12:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:32:41] <fnagel> Did you do anything regarding Calendar / Jon?
[12:32:52] <fnagel> He posted some markup example: https://github.com/jongund/jquery-ui-datepicker
[12:33:29] <fnagel> Had no time yet to comment on this
[12:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't yet. I've been focused on the release.
[12:36:41] <fnagel> ok, I hoprefully find some time soon to talk about this with Jon
[12:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> I saw that you have a new PR for date creation. I'll review that after the meeting.
[12:41:18] <fnagel> yeah, basic stuff -- preparemtn for some timezone / test issue
[12:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like you also need to do this for the date component.
[12:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this doesn't do any actual fixing yet, just abstracts out the date createion?
[12:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> So this should be really easy to review :-)
[12:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss?
[12:43:20] <fnagel> right, just the extraction as I still have no idea how to fix the actual thing :-D
[12:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I can play around with that after I review and see if I can come up with a way to fix it.
[12:44:35] <fnagel> would be nice if you could help -- a good start point is to adjust your local systen time to "some last day of the month"
[12:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for the tip
[12:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
