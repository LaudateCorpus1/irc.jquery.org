[08:33:25] <leobalter> hey
[08:34:19] <leobalter> pending the final review of #785, seems good so far
[08:34:25] <leobalter> (the core split)
[08:35:39] <leobalter> we need a better solution on #802 or stick with my last argument there (https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/802#issuecomment-93625947)
[08:35:45] <jzaefferer> leobalter: I've looked through that today, but didn't finish. Refactoring like that are really bad to review with a diff of all changes
[08:36:14] <jzaefferer> last argument? the bandname?
[08:36:26] <leobalter> no :) the one I linked
[08:36:47] <leobalter> also, I'm down for to set up a jQuery band.
[08:37:00] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure what you're arguing for
[08:37:08] <leobalter> I'm also going to the jQuery SF, will someone from the testing team going as well?
[08:37:50] <leobalter> well, the argument was that my regexp catches only boolean values, as strings are already represented with quotes
[08:39:00] <leobalter> browserstack tests are still being problematic on all the timeouts.
[08:39:23] <jzaefferer> so are you saying the PR is good as-is or are you suggesting a change?
[08:39:31] <jzaefferer> for some reason I'm pretty confused about this
[08:39:48] <leobalter> I'm saying the PR is good as-is
[08:40:19] <leobalter> there'll be no mess on diffs that will bring string or boolean values
[08:40:43] <jzaefferer> gotcha
[08:40:47] <jzaefferer> well let's merge it then
[08:40:52] <leobalter> good
[08:40:57] <leobalter> 2 other topics
[08:41:22] <leobalter> 1- can we make a work force on the 2 remaining features for QUnit 2?
[08:41:51] <leobalter> they are the nested suites and the standard reporter interface
[08:42:41] <leobalter> the other issues in the 2.0 milestone are only deprecation/removal references
[08:42:42] <jzaefferer> yeah, we should do something
[08:42:53] <jzaefferer> would be good to deal with the remaining open PRs first
[08:43:15] <jzaefferer> I'm currently spending all my time on jQuery UI 1.12, getting closer, but will likely take another week or two
[08:43:26] <jzaefferer> for jsreporter we may have a GSoC student working on it
[08:43:37] <leobalter> good
[08:43:58] <leobalter> 2- is there a light for the stdout reporter?
[08:44:34] <jzaefferer> there's still this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/790#discussion_r27982010
[08:45:18] <jzaefferer> regarding jQuery SF, I won't be there; I haven't heard anything from James or Krinkle, I assume they won't be there either
[08:45:37] <JamesMGreene> Correct, will not be able to make it to SF this time around
[08:45:44] <JamesMGreene> o/
[08:45:45] <leobalter> on the PR that is also solved on https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/9bea625
[08:46:04] <leobalter> it's properly using the global.QUnit
[08:46:20] <jzaefferer> sure, but as I commented: "still doesn't explain why it was working before."
[08:46:40] <jzaefferer> which you then wanted to investigate
[08:46:56] <leobalter> the QUnit leaking as global is something else we need to address in another patch, and that's independent from the stdout reporter
[08:47:17] <leobalter> I have some thoughts, but I've also got some time issues
[08:47:52] <leobalter> I'm spending this month in Brazil, and it is being busy
[08:48:52] <leobalter> there's nothing here that says QUnit is intentionally exposed to the global scope on Node: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/export.js#L53-L64
[08:49:49] <jzaefferer> maybe we end up as `window` pointing at `global`?
[08:49:56] <jzaefferer> *end up with
[08:50:20] <jzaefferer> we alias `this` to `window`: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/outro.js
[08:50:53] <jzaefferer> we should probably kill that and only reference `window` as `window`...
[08:50:58] <leobalter> I can't find a clue https://github.com/jquery/qunit/search?p=3&q=global+OR+window&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93
[08:51:14] <jzaefferer> look at intro and outro
[08:51:28] <jzaefferer> and then https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/export.js#L2
[08:51:49] <jzaefferer> so `this` maps to `global`, which we alias to `window`, which we then assign QUnit to
[08:52:21] <leobalter> got it
[08:52:22] <leobalter> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/export.js#L2
[08:52:54] <leobalter> this if goes true on Node (just put a console.log inside and tested on node)
[08:53:11] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/790#discussion_r28886124
[08:53:18] <leobalter> and this is where we're exporting QUnit https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/export.js#L49
[08:53:42] <leobalter> I'll send a PR fixing it
[08:53:46] <leobalter> today
[08:53:47] <leobalter> now
[08:53:52] <jzaefferer> alright
[08:55:47] <jzaefferer> I'll try to escalate the browserstack-runner issues, make some more serious noise
[08:55:52] <jzaefferer> not sure if it'll help
[08:55:59] <jzaefferer> anything else?
[09:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> NO, NOW GET OUT! :-P

[09:00:30] <arthurvr> hey all
[09:00:51] <kswedberg> hey arthurvr
[09:01:03] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:50] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> Our ticket count increased a bit, but that's actually ok.
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's mostly tickets for removing deprecated options in 1.13.
[09:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> And there was a bug in the new .transfer() method that I found today, which jzaefferer already has a PR for.
[09:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> And there's http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12205 which has a PR that's almost ready to land.
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> So all of that would get us back to +0.
[09:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer: What's the status of button?
[09:05:50] <arschmitz> we have been working through it together.
[09:06:13] <arschmitz> found some IE8 ugliness last night we will have to work around
[09:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> The form property?
[09:07:01] <arschmitz> yes
[09:07:12] <arschmitz> if someone sets the form attribute on an element
[09:07:21] <arschmitz> ir overwrites the form property with that string
[09:07:33] <arschmitz> only in ie8
[09:08:22] <arschmitz> so we need to find check if its a string and if it is try to find it on our own
[09:08:34] <arschmitz> i also noticed selectmenu is not handling form reset at all
[09:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, file an issue for htat.
[09:09:52] <arschmitz> well i was going to ask since it seems finding the form is non trivial and so is finding the label
[09:09:58] <arschmitz> and selectmenu does both wrong
[09:10:04] <arschmitz> should we extract these methods
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:10:24] <arschmitz> ok
[09:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> Throw them in core.js for now.
[09:10:30] <arschmitz> will do
[09:11:03] <arschmitz> so ill file an issue and do a pr to add these methods or just do them as part of button?
[09:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, since form is just a workaround for IE8, it's only likely to live for one version.
[09:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> So let's treat it as private API.
[09:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> What's the label issue?
[09:12:52] <arschmitz> its just really complex to properly find a label everywhere
[09:12:59] <arschmitz> we had already talked about pulling this one out
[09:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> Which browsers need the extra work?
[09:13:20] <arschmitz> just a sec getting link
[09:14:26] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/blob/button-fixup/ui/checkboxradio.js#L116-L162
[09:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> There's no support comment in there, so it doesn't answer my question ;-)
[09:15:07] <arschmitz> i need to check that because i dont remember but it was more then just ie8
[09:16:19] <arschmitz> part of it is for wp8
[09:17:24] <arschmitz> ill make a test page and run it through browsers and let you know where it fails
[09:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's make a public .labels() method.
[09:18:06] <arschmitz> sadly its the very innermost part that for wp8
[09:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, anything else for button?
[09:21:15] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[09:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> We finally finished porting tests to AMD.
[09:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> Had to work around a bug in IE8 and shim the TestSwarm injection script.
[09:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> Jörn finished the classes documentation.
[09:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> That landed in the 1-12 branch.
[09:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so this brings us to a demo I want to delete.
[09:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/slider/side-scroll.html
[09:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> Custom scrollbars are generally terrible; this implementation is far from ideal.
[09:24:00] <arthurvr> nice work on that docs, Jörn!
[09:24:23] <scott_gonzalez> You can't even scroll with the mousewheel.
[09:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> Can we just delete this?
[09:24:46] <arschmitz> im fine with it
[09:24:52] <arthurvr> :+1:
[09:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> Fantastic. I'll do that and close the associated PR.
[09:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> For the endless appending with tooltips, I met with Dylan to go over our AT support and discuss potential solutions.
[09:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> Dylan is testing a simplified approach in our supported browser/AT combinations.
[09:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> On a related note, I documented our AT support on jqueryui.com (but haven't deployed yet).
[09:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't get a chance to work on selectmenu max-height this week.
[09:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> And last item on the agenda, Jörn has been making good progress on 1-12 docs, beyond just classes.
[09:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:31:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks everyone.
[09:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
[09:31:27] <arthurvr> bye
[10:01:28] <arthurvr> hey everybody
[10:01:48] <kswedberg> hi arthurvr
[10:01:51] <agcolom> hey :-)
[10:01:56] <arthurvr> `contentteam
[10:01:57] <b-ot> arthurvr: agcolom arschmitz arthurvr AurelioDeRosa danheberden gnarf kswedberg RWhitbeck scott_gonzalez sfrisk
[10:02:21] <agcolom> good afternoon everyone!
[10:02:32] <agcolom> agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:03:19] <agcolom> Let's get started...
[10:03:51] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone
[10:03:51] <agcolom> so Spider... and broken links
[10:04:23] <agcolom> many have been fixed by Acho Arnold and Igor
[10:04:23] <agcolom> (Both been in contact with us through GSOC)
[10:04:54] <agcolom> and they've been great with helping
[10:05:11] <arthurvr> Yup. Don’t know if they are here but huge thanks!
[10:05:26] <agcolom> arthurvr: did you want to say something on this?
[10:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've seen lots of PRs flying by :-)
[10:06:00] <arthurvr> nope nothing more then thanks to those people. Irritating work to do TBH.
[10:07:23] <agcolom> I've been disconnected :-(
[10:07:54] <agcolom> anyone araound? (not sure my connection is working...)
[10:08:00] <arthurvr> hey hey
[10:08:08] <agcolom> ah :-)
[10:08:19] <arthurvr> next up I guess?
[10:08:23] <agcolom> yep
[10:08:52] <agcolom> So I'll be working with Kris on some changes to the foundation pages
[10:09:21] <arthurvr> You mean the new team page and cleaning up the top nav right?
[10:09:28] <agcolom> that's right
[10:09:30] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/issues/95
[10:10:04] <agcolom> So last time I spoke to Kris he told me he started some work but hasn't pushed yet, so we can take over then when that's up
[10:10:34] <agcolom> and I guess that will involve regular contacts with Kris to ensure that follows what he wants.
[10:10:59] <agcolom> other than that I'm looking at updating the contribute pages
[10:11:10] <agcolom> I've opened 2 issues
[10:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good if he just used the normal workflow.
[10:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> Commenting on the issue, starting a WIP PR or pushing a branch, etc.
[10:11:47] <arthurvr> Kris you mean? yeah
[10:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:11:59] <agcolom> yes.
[10:12:17] <arschmitz> +1
[10:12:19] <agcolom> so I'll ask Kris to push his branch when he can
[10:13:00] <arthurvr> Yeah that would be nice, plus a WIP PR to keep us updated and have it reviewed.
[10:13:46] <agcolom> ok, so the contribute pahes
[10:13:48] <agcolom> pages
[10:13:49] <agcolom>  https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/116
[10:14:05] <agcolom> and https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/115
[10:14:19] <agcolom>  https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/116
[10:15:26] <agcolom> I was finding confusing the fact that we say that users should fork, clone their fork, add the main repo as upstream but then we say git push --tags origin master
[10:15:44] <agcolom> so I was thinking of changing origin to upstream on that command
[10:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like the majority were in favor of the proposed change.
[10:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> What do others in here think?
[10:16:25] <arthurvr> Yeah I would be +1 to changing, although I think all people reading that doc are smart enough people with git that this doesn’t cause confusion.
[10:17:07] <arschmitz> i always use origin as the actual repo not the fork
[10:17:12] <arschmitz> but i dont care what we do here
[10:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> So do I, but I'm in favor of this change.
[10:17:33] <agcolom> in all cases, we can always add a warning div to remind users to check their remotes before the command
[10:17:43] <arschmitz> im used to just assuming everyone else is oppisite
[10:17:48] <agcolom> anyone against the change?
[10:18:32] <agcolom> everyone happy with the proposed change?
[10:18:57] <arthurvr> I don’t think so
[10:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> Haha, way to go asking two opposite questions :-P
[10:19:41] <agcolom> I know, I'm stupid ;-)
[10:19:57] <agcolom> so we'll go with the proposed change :-)
[10:20:01] <agcolom> and warning note
[10:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:20:07] <arthurvr> sgtm
[10:20:14] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:21:08] <agcolom> and https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/115
[10:21:36] <agcolom> any volunteer to write that section?
[10:21:51] <agcolom> (CLA check)
[10:22:25] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you agree with https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/115#issuecomment-94780172
[10:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:22:52] <agcolom> ok, if noone volunteers I'm happy to give it a try
[10:23:03] <arthurvr> great agcolom ;)
[10:23:39] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: are you going to make new changes to the cla checker in the near future or have these taken place already?
[10:24:15] <agcolom> (eg check against an array of matches rather than first match)
[10:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have any changes high up on my todo list.
[10:24:27] <agcolom> right, ok
[10:25:46] <agcolom> Anyone has anything to discuss? (update?)
[10:26:15] <arthurvr> quite a bunch happened in api.jquery.com lately but not really worth discussing at the meeting IMHO
[10:26:45] <agcolom> ok, so I'll have more time until the 29th April. Then I'll be receiving 317 exam scripts to mark :-P
[10:27:24] <agcolom> I'll try to reduce the number of issues on the mobile api site
[10:27:32] <arthurvr> have fun with those :p
[10:28:05] <agcolom> as this is now about 30% of content tickets
[10:28:57] <arthurvr> 19.5%, actually
[10:29:25] <agcolom> Ha, my brain added 10% to make me feel terrible ;-)
[10:29:31] <arthurvr> haha :D
[10:29:33] <AurelioDeRosa> :)
[10:30:18] <agcolom> right, so it's 2nd worst repo in terms of open tickets/PRs
[10:30:30] <arthurvr> Gotta talk to rxaviers as well but I wonder what the plans are for globalize and api.globalize sites?
[10:31:05] <agcolom> I think we should try to help with that
[10:32:49] <agcolom> anything else to discuss?
[10:33:04] <AurelioDeRosa> I don't think
[10:33:06] <arthurvr> don’t think so
[10:33:48] <agcolom> ok. I don't think the jquery account tweeted AurelioDeRosa's post
[10:34:06] <agcolom> so I'll ask Kris...
[10:34:19] <arthurvr> yeah
[10:34:34] <arthurvr> wonder why we don’t automate that using some fancy wordpress tech? (should be possible no?)
[10:34:45] <AurelioDeRosa> indeed it didn't, but I thought it was on purpos
[10:35:03] <AurelioDeRosa> there is a good plugin that i use called wp-twiter
[10:35:57] <agcolom> does that allow custom tweet text or does it just pick it up from the post?
[10:36:15] <AurelioDeRosa> allows custom text, tags, and so on
[10:36:21] <AurelioDeRosa> it's really powerful
[10:36:54] <agcolom> ok, I'll add that to the note, and will bring it up to the next Foundation meeting, see what people think.
[10:37:00] <AurelioDeRosa> https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-to-twitter/
[10:37:03] <AurelioDeRosa> here you go
[10:37:10] <arthurvr> I have a double feeling about it
[10:37:17] <AurelioDeRosa> it's wp to twitter
[10:39:12] <agcolom> I mean it's not as if we post every day...
[10:39:35] <agcolom> so manual tweets isn't an issue I think
[10:40:10] <agcolom> In our current case, there was some noise already with GSOC so it wasn't a bad thing to wait a bit for that to settle down
[10:40:23] <agcolom> Now might be a better time in a way.
[10:40:39] <AurelioDeRosa> If you think so, let's wait. But in case you want to adopt a plugin, I vote for it
[10:41:03] <agcolom> ok. It;s in the notes, so would be easy to find it again
[10:41:16] <agcolom> ok, so I think we're done?
[10:41:24] <agcolom> any question from anyone?
[10:41:26] <arthurvr> yep
[10:41:31] <arthurvr> no we’re done I mean
[10:41:47] <agcolom> Oh I have to stop asking 2 opposite questions!
[10:42:05] <AurelioDeRosa> I fixed an issue with the search bar, but I don't think that we need to discuss it here
[10:42:18] <AurelioDeRosa> It affects the api site as well, but it's a general patch
[10:42:21] <arthurvr> nah that’s just an all-day ticket ya know
[10:42:39] <arthurvr> also the PR needs some modifications
[10:42:54] <AurelioDeRosa> OK
[10:43:10] <AurelioDeRosa> That's all from me then :)
[10:43:23] <agcolom> ok, thanks everyone, next meeting in 2 weeks :-)
[10:43:30] <AurelioDeRosa> see you :)
[10:43:32] <AurelioDeRosa> bye
[10:43:39] <arthurvr> bye
[10:44:02] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: are you still around to close? Thank you :-)
[10:44:14] <arthurvr> somebody should grant agcolom access lol
[10:44:33] <arthurvr> to lock/unlock
[10:45:09] <agcolom> arschmitz: are you still around to close? Thanks :-)
[10:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> Bug gnarf or s5fs about it :-)
[10:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or maybe even ajpiano
[10:47:16] <ajpiano> agcolom already has access to lock and unlock :p
[12:25:12] <agcolom> .
