[09:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone!
[09:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> rworth jzaefferer kborchers gnarf
[09:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> xavier_
[09:00:55] <gnarf> yup
[09:01:01] * xavier_ 's here
[09:01:02] <jzaefferer> almost
[09:01:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sorry, i had a last minute meeting for work just come up so won't be around. i'll read back through logs though and comment if needed
[09:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ok
[09:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you want to kick off the meeting with any updates on bot.io/mergeatron/whatever?
[09:03:40] <gnarf> mikesherov wants us to try this thing Snap has been working on
[09:03:43] <gnarf> looks promising
[09:03:53] <gnarf> mergeatron
[09:04:06] <gnarf> bot.io is working for jquery/jquery-ui right now
[09:04:20] <gnarf> https://github.com/SnapInteractive/mergeatron/
[09:05:17] <gnarf> i think we could make that do what we want, it already has some sense of a jenkins integration
[09:05:26] <gnarf> but i'm thinking thats overly complex for our use case
[09:05:39] <gnarf> also testing wise
[09:05:56] <gnarf> we should try to get the phantomjs smoke test
[09:06:04] <gnarf> on everything
[09:06:32] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ^^^
[09:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like a good idea.
[09:07:07] <gnarf> plugins / download / etc all seem stable in stage?
[09:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> I need to get back to testing the plugins site.
[09:08:01] <gnarf> let me know
[09:08:02] <gnarf> also
[09:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> Got sidetracked with other stuff.
[09:08:18] <gnarf> we need to think about what we want to do with legacy urls from plugins.
[09:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> Let them rot?
[09:09:02] <gnarf> Well - like jQuery color will be on the old and the new
[09:09:09] <gnarf> a 301 would seem legit
[09:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that we'll want to 301 all the plugins though.
[09:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> And it seems a bit crazy to be writing one-offs for every plugin that's duplicated.
[09:11:52] * gnarf shrugs, seems like a lot of relevance for those plugins
[09:11:52] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:12:25] <gnarf> the ones that don't resolve can bounce to archive. until we decide to totally murder it
[09:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't want 80-90% of the redirects to 404.
[09:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> If you can have the redirects be conditional, that seems fine.
[09:15:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: im thinking send all 404's to a second node service we can write quick
[09:16:32] <gnarf> seems simple enough
[09:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to docs.
[09:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> The API site is essentially done.
[09:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on the single file XML dump.
[09:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it all working except for <placeholder> replacements.
[09:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why that's not working right now.
[09:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> Once I get that figured out, I'll move all the XSL and processing logic into grunt-wordpress and update all API repos.
[09:20:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: have we solidified how to handle 1-8.api.jqueryui.com ?
[09:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: TR update?
[09:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: no, I'll add that to the list.
[09:21:26] <rxaviers> ok, so proceeding
[09:21:30] <rxaviers> ThemeRoller is almost there!
[09:21:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you mean moving to grunt-jquery-content?
[09:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yes, thanks
[09:22:07] <jzaefferer> are we getting rid of the identity transforms?
[09:22:13] * rxaviers 's waiting
[09:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Identity transforms can't go away, but the preprocessing step is gone.
[09:22:55] <jzaefferer> okay?
[09:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it will be gone when I update grunt-jquery-content.
[09:23:08] <jzaefferer> I guess that was my point
[09:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> The preprocessing doesn't do anything any more.
[09:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: So you're making good progress on the front-end?
[09:24:42] <rxaviers> Right now on TR we have:
[09:24:47] <rxaviers> - TR frontend has been ported and working, live preview is working (including the icon and texture images), and it's properly linking to DownloadBuilder. I've added a Theme section to DownloadBuilder ("no theme" and "custom theme" so far). The downloaded package reflects the custom theme correctly (server part was already done and it has been integrated).
[09:24:57] <rxaviers> TODO:
[09:24:57] <rxaviers> - I'm finishing up the DownloadBuilder integration for "named themes". Remaining stuff are: (a) TR themePicker select at frontend, (b) clean it up for code review (some ported code needs coding standards fix).
[09:25:33] <rxaviers> Questions, comments? :)
[09:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> You have the scoping feature implemented?
[09:26:14] <rxaviers> ah! nope
[09:26:27] <rxaviers> adding to my TODO
[09:27:54] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: can you get rid of all the console logging?
[09:28:12] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, yeap. All the code still needs proper cleanup. I have a lot of FIXME comments too
[09:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> Have you looked through http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/10?P=themeroller ?
[09:28:59] <rxaviers> no
[09:29:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: also the index.html demo links to the wrong css file when selecting a custom theme
[09:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that would be good to do :-)
[09:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Feel free to add a comment to the tickets that are fixed in the rewrite.
[09:29:50] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ok
[09:30:10] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hm, good point. thks will check and fix that.
[09:32:50] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: frontend.js is used by the jqueryui.com site repo, we need you to set that up locally to test it
[09:33:05] <jzaefferer> I think the change from frontend.js to download.js is going to break stuff
[09:35:26] <rxaviers> I've updated packages'main to point to download.js. But, I can check that offline with you.
[09:36:05] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:37:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: anything else on jqueryui.com?
[09:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> I implemented the demo system.
[09:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[09:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> Demos are loaded into an iframe.
[09:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> Which fixes all of the problems with the existing demo system.
[09:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get syntax highlighting in the view source section.
[09:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> And improve the styling.
[09:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not worried about either of those for initial launch.
[09:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> Still need to figure out the content for the rest of the site.
[09:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> But we're making good progress.
[09:39:59] <jzaefferer> good
[09:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking we might ship with an under construction type page :-/
[09:40:19] <jzaefferer> examples are now ordered alphabetically?
[09:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> But the important info will all be there.
[09:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[09:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> I figured the order doesn't really matter too much.
[09:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll eventually replace them with completely different demos.
[09:41:04] <jzaefferer> right
[09:42:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: only if the construction link points to the github repo ;)
[09:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it will :-)
[09:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> I fixed the focus handling in menu.
[09:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> And I should be able to start working on the blog redesign by the end of the week.
[09:46:38] <jzaefferer> with events.jquery.org online, jqueryui.com redesigned would be the third to launch with the new theme
[09:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> And jqueryui.com, blog.jqueryui.com, api.jqueryui.com will all launch together.
[09:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's all I've got.
[09:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:50:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: all visual tests and demos work Chrome 21 … now on to the rest of the browsers :P
[09:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's everything.
[09:52:11] <jzaefferer> (party)
[09:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
