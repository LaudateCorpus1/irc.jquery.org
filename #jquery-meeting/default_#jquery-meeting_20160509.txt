[11:59:43] <DaveMethvin> here!
[11:59:59] <gibson042> also here!
[12:00:01] <timmywil> how goes it
[12:00:38] <timmywil> So, I hope to finish up 1.12.4, 2.2.4, and 3.0 rc this week
[12:00:54] <timmywil> 1.12/2.2 is pretty much me
[12:01:03] <timmywil> Should have PRs for everything today
[12:01:29] <timmywil> I'll double test that webpack thing. ugh
[12:01:49] <DaveMethvin> i'll fix the docs issue here https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/130
[12:02:15] <gibson042> my jQuery tasks for this week look like Migrate
[12:02:50] <DaveMethvin> the two from last week are done now, just removed them from the agenda
[12:03:03] <timmywil> ah, ok
[12:03:08] <timmywil> any other potential additions?
[12:03:41] <DaveMethvin> jbedard pointed out a new issue, I can fix it this week https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/189
[12:04:13] <timmywil> oh, speaking of jbedard
[12:04:18] <timmywil> welcome!
[12:04:28] <jbedard> hey! sorry I'm a minute late, just got into work...
[12:04:29] <DaveMethvin> ohai!
[12:04:44] <DaveMethvin> you west coast guys :)
[12:04:44] <timmywil> np
[12:04:49] <m_gol> present
[12:06:08] <m_gol> hi everyone, especially jbedard :)
[12:06:53] <DaveMethvin> i think 3.0 is pretty much ready
[12:07:15] <DaveMethvin> once those last two land
[12:07:24] <m_gol> plus the webpack thingy
[12:07:28] <m_gol> as it's broken everywhere
[12:07:38] <gibson042> any objections to landing the jQuery.when PR?
[12:07:42] <DaveMethvin> none
[12:07:57] <timmywil> yup, need to land that and decide on touch properties
[12:08:05] <timmywil> but that could probably be after rc if needed
[12:09:25] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3104
[12:09:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: or would you call that a blocker
[12:09:41] <timmywil> you broke my plugin
[12:09:45] <timmywil> which I forgot about
[12:10:03] <DaveMethvin> i can add a test to be sure we handle it
[12:10:05] <DaveMethvin> in migrate
[12:10:32] <DaveMethvin> let me look at doing that anyway
[12:10:52] <timmywil> but, what's the resolution for the core issue?
[12:11:30] <DaveMethvin> just land that pr
[12:11:44] <DaveMethvin> you shouldn't need the plugins now
[12:11:56] <timmywil> oh...there's a PR
[12:11:58] <jbedard> I think we may as well add touch properties now, will make the 3.0 upgrade easier for people using things like the touch plugin
[12:12:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:12:15] <timmywil> yup, that's easy
[12:12:25] <m_gol> +1
[12:12:26] <timmywil> yea, I like adding those
[12:12:47] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll land it
[12:13:08] <m_gol> timmywil: regarding the 3.0.0 release: how are you testing Android 2.3 before releasing?
[12:13:34] <timmywil> for final, we'll want to do a run a testswarm
[12:13:54] <timmywil> for a pre-release, I'm less worried
[12:14:04] <m_gol> we don't have it on TestSwarm, it has to be done manually
[12:14:14] <DaveMethvin> i recommend some spell involving a dead cat and a shrunken head
[12:14:21] <timmywil> isn't there a manually triggered testswarm run?
[12:14:21] <m_gol> we pulled it as it was timing out 80% of times
[12:14:23] <m_gol> even on basic
[12:14:38] <DaveMethvin> swarm has been pretty flakey lately for everything
[12:14:50] <timmywil> I mean, I can run basic on sauce or something
[12:15:44] <m_gol> we don't have a job for that, we used to but it wasn't really working
[12:15:59] <timmywil> gotcha
[12:16:08] <timmywil> actually, looks like sauce doesn't have android 2.3 anymore
[12:16:24] <m_gol> btw, Android 2.3 share dropped from about 5% when we decided to sort-of support it
[12:16:26] <m_gol> to 2.2%
[12:16:31] <timmywil> ah, but browserstack does
[12:16:43] <timmywil> but not on a physical device
[12:17:01] <m_gol> I still think we shouldn't sort-of support it, it causes problems and has miniscule market share
[12:17:06] <DaveMethvin> i know we don't want to drop browsers on non-majors but it's getting pretty hard to test things like IE6/7 and Android 2.3 now
[12:17:41] <timmywil> well, to be honest, I haven't been testing Android 2.3 for 1.12 releases
[12:17:47] <m_gol> yeah, BrowserStack had to restore one special IE6 client just for us as the default ones were broken
[12:17:48] <m_gol> :P
[12:17:55] <DaveMethvin> i feel bad about that
[12:18:09] <m_gol> timmywil: don't you follow https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Release-process?
[12:18:21] <timmywil> m_gol: sure, but...
[12:18:51] <m_gol> ok, then i think we should just stop pretending we sort-of support Android 2.3 in a basic way
[12:18:57] <m_gol> we clearly don't
[12:19:21] <timmywil> I'll run basic on 2.3 this release
[12:19:24] <m_gol> and not throwing on .css('width', '10px') doesn't mean the whole page doesn't break
[12:19:49] <m_gol> even if we do run basic tests on it for now, do we have to state officially that we're doing that?
[12:19:53] <m_gol> that's my main concern
[12:20:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think the best we can do for these cases is react to bug reports and maybe we make it clear that these older browsers are just too fragile for a full unit test run
[12:20:45] <timmywil> yea, I think we can say that
[12:20:57] <m_gol> because currently we're documenting basic support for Android 2.3 at the browser support page
[12:21:15] <DaveMethvin> i think that's fine?
[12:21:18] <m_gol> I think we should pull that note, state only 4.0+ support and do it all "unofficially" for now
[12:21:30] <DaveMethvin> i'd be good with that too
[12:21:40] <jbedard> 3.0 might be a good time to do that...
[12:21:48] <DaveMethvin> good point
[12:22:12] <m_gol> because "basic support" sounds like "we're not correcting pixel-perfect bugs" and not like "we're running 5% of the tests there but it may break completely anyway"
[12:22:19] <DaveMethvin> anyone opposed to dumping Android 2.3 official support in 3.0?
[12:22:44] <DaveMethvin> i mean if someone reports a bug we can fix, we can fix it, but we already aren't running unit tests
[12:23:14] <gibson042> I do think it's worth explicitly mentioned that we run "no catastrophic failures" tests
[12:23:30] <m_gol> I don't think people will fully realise what that means
[12:23:44] <gibson042> i.e., that `<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0.js"></script>` won't break your page
[12:23:47] <timmywil> Okay. Reading the Unsupported Browsers section of https://jquery.com/browser-support/, I think our support of 2.3 falls under that category.
[12:23:58] <m_gol> but it still might break your page
[12:24:10] <m_gol> if you depend on jQuery heavily and one of the APIs breaks
[12:24:13] <gibson042> no, _using_ it might have effects
[12:24:16] <timmywil> it doesn't say we don't fix bugs for those browsers, just that we "generally" don't
[12:24:19] <m_gol> because we're hardly testing anything there
[12:24:19] <gibson042> but _loading_ it is safe
[12:24:45] <m_gol> ok, fair enough, but people loading jQuery generally use it for something ;)
[12:25:22] <m_gol> also, what timmywil said, I agree Android 2.3 seems to fit this text
[12:25:31] <m_gol> "While jQuery might run without major issues in older browser versions, we do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs that may appear in them."
[12:25:33] <m_gol> all true
[12:25:47] <gibson042> yes, I agree
[12:25:48] <gibson042> +1
[12:26:42] <timmywil> I think we've updated this page in a 3.0 branch for jquery.com, right? We'll need to edit that again.
[12:26:42] <m_gol> so, can I just remove mentions of Android 2.3 from the browser-support page? or am I misunderstanding the +1? :)
[12:27:05] <m_gol> I can do it, this branch already has about 20 commits that I'm rebasing from time to time
[12:27:21] <timmywil> m_gol: yea, I think removal makes sense
[12:27:30] <DaveMethvin> sgtm
[12:27:38] <m_gol> k, I'll do it!
[12:27:40] <timmywil> Unless we want another section for basic support, but I see that being potentially confusing
[12:28:05] <timmywil> I'd rather just say "use at your own risk". Report bugs if you wants.
[12:28:08] <timmywil> want
[12:28:21] <m_gol> yeah
[12:28:26] <DaveMethvin> there's a mention in the upgrade guide too, i'll fix that one
[12:28:32] <timmywil> cool
[12:28:33] <m_gol> I just don't see a way of documenting that that's not confusing
[12:28:41] <timmywil> Thanks for bringing that up, m_gol
[12:29:36] <timmywil> anything else this week? I should have PRs for remaining 1.12.4/2.2.4 issues, we'll land jquery.when, and I'll email the 3.0 rc blog post this week to prepare for release.
[12:30:26] <timmywil> cool. thanks everybody. back to -dev.
[12:30:29] <timmywil> jquery core out
