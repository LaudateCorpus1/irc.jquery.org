[11:00:38] <gseguin> hiya
[11:00:46] <arschmitz> hi
[11:00:51] * _|Nix|_ waves
[11:00:57] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:01:19] <rxaviers> is this mobile meeting?
[11:01:25] <uGoMobi> it is rxaviers
[11:01:54] <uGoMobi> let's start with the new topics
[11:01:55] <cgack> hi
[11:01:56] <rxaviers> shoot I've schedule globalize in a busy spot :(
[11:01:59] <uGoMobi> hey cgack
[11:02:04] <iskren> hello
[11:02:15] <uGoMobi> panel on Android
[11:02:26] <uGoMobi> hello iskren
[11:02:38] <iskren> hm, rxaviers we can move to another room?
[11:02:39] <rxaviers> iskren, Nikerabbit, Krinkle|detached, can we chat in 1hour or in a different channel?
[11:02:57] <iskren> I prefer different channel
[11:03:12] <rxaviers> I've just created #jquery-meeting2
[11:03:23] <rxaviers> Sorry for interrupting the mobile meeting
[11:03:28] <uGoMobi> it's ok
[11:03:31] <uGoMobi> have a good meeting
[11:03:35] <rxaviers> thks :)
[11:03:45] <uGoMobi> ok, so panel on Android
[11:03:49] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[11:03:57] <_|Nix|_> I'm starting to think there's not much we can do.
[11:03:57] <uGoMobi> before we digg into that too much
[11:04:15] <uGoMobi> we already said we want to make a new panel widget
[11:04:20] <uGoMobi> starting from scratch
[11:04:28] <_|Nix|_> That's cool, but what about 1.4.x?
[11:04:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: how bad do you really think this is?
[11:04:46] <arschmitz> is it worth the effort?
[11:04:50] <uGoMobi> so we have to discuss what priority this issue should get
[11:04:59] <uGoMobi> exactly
[11:04:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean, making the new panel?
[11:05:07] <uGoMobi> nope, fixing the issue
[11:05:13] <arschmitz> no fixing in 1.4.x
[11:05:18] <_|Nix|_> I'm not sure we /can/ fix the issue.
[11:05:42] <uGoMobi> from experience I can tell that fixing this issue probably introduces a new issue on another OS/version
[11:06:34] <_|Nix|_> I do think that there's waaay too much class juggling going on though.
[11:06:42] <uGoMobi> so I think it's going to take a lot of time to fix and test this
[11:06:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: agreed
[11:07:05] <_|Nix|_> I can't believe this can't be done more simply.
[11:07:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but that's something we will work on when designing new widget
[11:07:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it can
[11:07:39] <arschmitz> but thats for a new widget
[11:07:51] <uGoMobi> we learned from this one
[11:07:55] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually thinking that we should maybe add a wrapper to the page container, and then move the wrapper around.
[11:08:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi and i have been fighting panel from the begining
[11:08:13] <uGoMobi> I don't think this is the right time to discuss new panel widget
[11:08:19] <_|Nix|_> Like: <pagecontainer><wrapper><page><panel><toolbar><page><page></wrapper></pagecontainer>
[11:08:30] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats for a wiki and another time
[11:08:36] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, OK.
[11:08:38] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:08:44] <_|Nix|_> So, panel stays buggy in 1.4.x?
[11:08:53] <_|Nix|_> ... on Android 4.0.0?
[11:08:54] <arschmitz> unless you can find an easy fix
[11:08:57] <uGoMobi> I don't say we shouldn't fix bugs at all
[11:09:14] <arschmitz> yeah just this one if it cant eaily be fixed
[11:09:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The bad thing is it feels like there might be one, but I'm just taking stabs at it.
[11:10:03] <uGoMobi> that's the tricky thing about panel... it seems so simple
[11:10:24] <uGoMobi> but it caused lot of headaches already
[11:10:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've stepped through the code and, unless it doesn't update immediately upon application/removal of a class, there is no in-between state that looks like the frame you see in that flash.
[11:10:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The panel's a siren.
[11:11:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so some times it redrwas mid tic and some times it does not?
[11:11:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what it looks like.
[11:11:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You catch the rendering thread at a bad time, and bam!
[11:11:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But that might just be because we're adding so many classes, instead of doing it all with very few dom manips.
[11:11:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that normally means something is getting checked like a height or dimensions or something
[11:12:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ...
[11:12:27] <uGoMobi> we could introduce BEM here already
[11:12:39] <uGoMobi> just add/remove one class
[11:12:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the panel /is/ getting positioned.
[11:12:45] <uGoMobi> but again, that's for later
[11:12:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nah we just need to simplify the process not the number really
[11:13:00] <uGoMobi> let's make a decision about the milestone of this issue
[11:13:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but I'll check up on that lead after the meeting.
[11:13:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's a fix, so 1.4.x, but I'm not sure it /can/ be fixed.
[11:13:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I thought both could go hand in hand
[11:13:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, if we fix it via a re-implement, then the re-implement will also fix this issue.
[11:13:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i just mean bem alone would not fix
[11:14:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: true, there is more to it
[11:14:20] <arschmitz> because with current process it would still happen because you would be juggling 100 bem classes instead
[11:15:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, exactly.
[11:15:23] <uGoMobi> panel rewrite is planned for 1.7
[11:15:57] <_|Nix|_> I think that sounds about right in terms of all the stuff that's already on our plate.
[11:16:06] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:16:22] <uGoMobi> I vote for not spending too much time on this issue right now
[11:17:11] <_|Nix|_> Alright. Sounds good.
[11:17:53] <uGoMobi> doesn't mean we don't care, it's just that we have limited time and have to make choices
[11:18:15] <uGoMobi> bigger chance we can fix this with new panel widget
[11:18:32] <uGoMobi> ok, topics from last week
[11:18:47] <uGoMobi> I did add labels in the issue tracker for PRs
[11:19:04] <uGoMobi> actually I want to clean up our labels
[11:19:29] <uGoMobi> we have too many if you ask me
[11:19:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i agree
[11:19:45] <uGoMobi> will work on that next week while doing triage at same time
[11:19:52] <arschmitz> actually im sure you noticed all the high priority stale comments
[11:20:00] <arschmitz> this moring
[11:20:03] <arschmitz> morning
[11:20:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:20:12] <uGoMobi> he got a point
[11:20:26] <arschmitz> well that person emailed me directly saying how he thinks that makes us look like we dont care about issues
[11:20:31] <Krinkle> o/
[11:20:39] <uGoMobi> I already removed the low and medium priority labels
[11:20:42] <uGoMobi> hey Krinkle
[11:20:52] <uGoMobi> Krinkle: they moved to #jquery-meeting2
[11:20:53] <arschmitz> which i think is a little over reaction but he makes a valid point
[11:21:12] <uGoMobi> yes I agree
[11:21:13] <arschmitz> he also offered to try and help and wants to joint the meetings
[11:21:19] <cgack> I'm happy to dig in and triage if you want help uGoMobi
[11:21:31] <uGoMobi> cgack: awesome, thanks!
[11:21:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh apparently he just emailed me and is trying to get on through freenode but cant
[11:22:00] <arschmitz> cgack: yeah just comment and we can check and close them behind you if you think they can be closed
[11:22:14] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's the best way
[11:22:24] <cgack> I'll do what I can. should I start with the oldest?
[11:22:32] <arschmitz> cgack: thts what i do
[11:22:33] <uGoMobi> so I removed those priority labels
[11:22:42] <uGoMobi> all tickets are important
[11:22:51] <arschmitz> cgack: also if you can confirm it still is a problem thats good to know too
[11:22:51] <uGoMobi> just kept "high priority"
[11:22:58] <Krinkle> uGoMobi: thx
[11:23:24] <uGoMobi> because we need to be able to highlight bugs that we want to fix before next release
[11:23:32] <uGoMobi> we have milestones for that of course
[11:23:48] <uGoMobi> but sometimes you want to release before all closed
[11:24:26] <uGoMobi> anyone disagree?
[11:24:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I mean we do punt bugs from release to release sometimes, but I guess the high prio ones should not be punted.
[11:24:33] <uGoMobi> or have a better system in mind?
[11:24:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[11:25:09] <_|Nix|_> There will always be a situation where it would have been nice to fix #nnnn for version x.y.z, but unfortunately we have to wait until x.y.z+1
[11:25:21] <uGoMobi> I also want to get rid of the "dev task" label
[11:25:29] <uGoMobi> because we abuse it
[11:25:40] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, it doesn't really fit anymore.
[11:25:47] <_|Nix|_> The issues are not a todo list.
[11:25:48] <uGoMobi> any change in code can be done by anyone, doesn't need to be dev team member
[11:26:10] <uGoMobi> so I will look into what those tickets are actually about while doing triage
[11:26:19] <uGoMobi> and discuss during the week on -dev
[11:27:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: dev task means its not a bug
[11:27:06] <arschmitz> its more of a todo
[11:27:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[11:27:23] <arschmitz> so that should stay
[11:27:31] <uGoMobi> but it sounds like only a team member could do it
[11:28:00] <uGoMobi> I remember someone asking if he could work on css linter implementation
[11:28:08] <uGoMobi> that was also a ticket with dev task label
[11:28:19] <_|Nix|_> Just call it "Task" then.
[11:28:28] <uGoMobi> so maybe it's only label name change thing
[11:28:52] <uGoMobi> but will see when I scan the tickets
[11:29:17] <_|Nix|_> Or simply call it "TODO" *shrug*
[11:29:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree it's good to have a label to distinguish bugs from other things
[11:30:08] <arschmitz> yeah does not matter what it is
[11:30:29] <arschmitz> dev task is just kinda traditional i think for such things
[11:31:03] <uGoMobi> there are also lot of other tickets that are not a bug but don't have that label
[11:32:00] <uGoMobi> ok let's discuss on -dev next week before making changes so we can first look at what kind of tickets we are actually talking about
[11:32:32] <uGoMobi> any updates about the other topics from last week?
[11:32:48] <arschmitz> sadly yes
[11:32:53] <uGoMobi> I am afraid arschmitz has an update about swipe on android 4.4
[11:32:57] <arschmitz> on swipe
[11:32:58] <uGoMobi> :(
[11:32:58] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:33:10] <arschmitz> well its fixed in chrome 35 beta
[11:33:10] <_|Nix|_> Everyone bow your heads!
[11:33:33] <arschmitz> but the chrome team promises it will break again in next build!
[11:33:42] <_|Nix|_> Yes!
[11:33:42] <arschmitz> so there was almost good news
[11:33:51] <uGoMobi> nice promise
[11:34:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im still talking with rick byers from chrome about possible work arounds
[11:34:36] <arschmitz> and there at least will be some now
[11:34:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's great
[11:35:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is touch-action css
[11:35:16] <arschmitz> which means you can disable horizontal scrolling and you will get touch events
[11:35:17] <uGoMobi> right
[11:35:38] <arschmitz> there is also touch overflow events
[11:35:54] <arschmitz> he sent me a liek 10 page doc he wrote on that which i need o read but i just got it
[11:36:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:36:30] <arschmitz> not touch overflow sorry but overscroll
[11:37:28] <arschmitz> basicly still up for debate i think it weather when its not possible to scroll eg when you are at top of page and move your finger down
[11:37:40] <arschmitz> you cant scroll up so should you get touch events here?
[11:38:05] <arschmitz> or what if your 20 px below top should you get one stop getting them and then get them again when you can no longer scroll
[11:38:26] <arschmitz> and if they do that what should the cords reflect and how would that work with touch cancel and touch start
[11:38:33] <arschmitz> its all very complicated
[11:38:40] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[11:39:03] <arschmitz> and its all cented around micro performance optimization
[11:40:18] <uGoMobi> did he gave an example of use cases where the changes in Chrome 35 are going to break things?
[11:40:59] <uGoMobi> right now I get the feeling that things might change each version
[11:41:25] <arschmitz> the one thing i dont like about using touch action here is the idea of needing to add a css prop in an event setup
[11:41:36] <arschmitz> and for examples of things it broke https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=360614
[11:41:52] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:44:52] <uGoMobi> ok, there is not much we can do about this at the moment besides discussing with Rick
[11:45:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well im testing work around he sugested
[11:45:25] <arschmitz> to see how the seem to work
[11:46:32] <uGoMobi> I hope it works
[11:47:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well touch action will work for sure
[11:48:36] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:49:14] <uGoMobi> any of the other updates or topics we need to discuss?
[11:49:23] <arschmitz> but i hate the thought of using .css() in an event :(
[11:49:50] <uGoMobi> yeah, totally agree
[11:49:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So much for separating event handing from dom manip.
[11:50:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: At least it's in the initial event :/
[11:50:15] <_|Nix|_> FWIW :/
[11:50:43] <arschmitz> and its not as odd as it seems i mean the whole point of that css prop is to effect events
[11:50:56] <arschmitz> it has no visual effect
[11:52:20] <arschmitz> so one last thing from me is on page events
[11:52:41] <arschmitz> i posted a novel here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7283 exepct angry replies any moment :)
[11:53:19] <arschmitz> im working on my second novel for the swipe issue
[11:53:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:54:58] <uGoMobi> but it's good that you take the time to explain to the community
[11:55:30] <uGoMobi> that it became a novel shows that we care :)
[11:55:41] <arschmitz> yeah there is a bit of a behind the scenes history to both of these
[11:57:12] <uGoMobi> ok, anything else?
[11:57:59] <uGoMobi> oh wait
[11:58:08] <uGoMobi> the style options removal
[11:58:18] <uGoMobi> there was email conversation
[11:58:35] <uGoMobi> and _|Nix|_ discussed with web-ui-fw team last Tuesday
[11:58:48] <uGoMobi> is everything clear now?
[11:59:00] <_|Nix|_> I believe so, but the PRs will tell the story.
[11:59:06] <arschmitz> the last things i saw in the meeting and email seemed like they are on the same page now
[11:59:12] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:59:15] <uGoMobi> yeah, thought so too
[11:59:22] <uGoMobi> great
[11:59:43] <uGoMobi> I think we can wrap up here
[11:59:47] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:59:52] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
