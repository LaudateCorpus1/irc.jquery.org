[12:00:03] <arschmitz> hi
[12:00:03] <fnagel> hey
[12:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yesterday, I finally had time to work on some bugs :-)
[12:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> Got some more tests passing.
[12:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> Interestingly, the fractional pixels for .position() test is failing in Chrome: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1639084
[12:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why Chrome would get rounded values.
[12:06:29] <arschmitz> weird
[12:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it should work fine: http://jsbin.com/tecudiluxa/edit?html,js,output
[12:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...yeah, our fractional support tests is failing.
[12:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, lack of fractional pixels is limited to IE <=9.
[12:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should just rip this code out and let them get inconsistent results that are off by 1px.
[12:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> What's a pixel between friends? :-P
[12:11:39] <jzaefferer> Since we already tolerate those, seems fine to me
[12:11:44] <jzaefferer> Don't we?
[12:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> Well, position has explicit tests for consistent results.
[12:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> So that subpixel errors can't mess with results.
[12:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find the ticket.
[12:12:57] <jzaefferer> oh, this is position, not dialog, right
[12:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think this is the bug: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6000
[12:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is the original one that I was thinking of: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5280
[12:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Of course the linked jsbin doesn't work because it references files that aren't hosted anymore.
[12:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> But the result was that the positioned element would bounce back and forth between two positions that were 1px apart.
[12:15:54] <arschmitz> so if its limited to ie9 and under support ends in 1.12 anyway
[12:16:01] <arschmitz> so 1 px seems minor
[12:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so I'll just rip this code out and send a PR.
[12:16:31] <jzaefferer> ok
[12:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> The timing on this next bug is kinda funny.
[12:18:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15038
[12:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel fixed the bug about numpad keys not searching through menus.
[12:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> And we talked about the proper fix being a move away from `event.keyCode`.
[12:19:00] <arschmitz> yup
[12:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> But that a simple fix was to just handle the numpad values.
[12:19:19] <scott_gonzalez> And as soon as the numpad values were fixed, someone filed a bug about accented characters.
[12:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> And they even state right in the ticket that we should stop using `keyCode` :-)
[12:19:53] <arschmitz> but when we looked wasnt support an issue
[12:20:29] <arschmitz> yeah no safari support
[12:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[12:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..I thought we just had to use two APIs.
[12:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> But could still move away from keyCode.
[12:21:31] <arschmitz> what would we use instead of keyCode in safari?
[12:21:32] <fnagel> from the history: arschmitz: also looks like no version of native android supports .key
[12:21:40] <fnagel> and: arschmitz: chrome only added in 51
[12:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> We can use .keyIdentifier though, right?
[12:22:01] <scott_gonzalez> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyIdentifier
[12:22:29] <arschmitz> that should be ok
[12:22:36] <arschmitz> though also deprecated and non standard
[12:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we should have an accent folding module.
[12:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> I wish you could specify optional dependencies in AMD.
[12:24:44] <arschmitz> yeah that always annoys me
[12:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...the position test suite doesn't fail for me locally.
[12:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, and now it does
[12:29:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, PR sent
[12:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> That brings us back to spinner supporting Globalize 1.x
[12:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15030
[12:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> This is actually a bit tricky.
[12:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> Globalize 0.x has `Globalize.format()` which accepts formats for any data type.
[12:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> But 1.x has multiple methods, one for each type.
[12:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> So `Globalize.formatNumber()`, `Globalize.formatCurrency()`, etc.
[12:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> Since the current spinner API just accepts a format, and we don't know the data type, we don't know which method to call.
[12:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why we have so many failures with jQuery 3.1.0: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3592
[12:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it got better with a rerun. There were lots of dead tests, not regular failures.
[12:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> That looks much better now.
[12:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep working on getting us completely green.
[12:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to release 1.12.1 next week.
[12:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> I fixed jqueryui.com deployments.
[12:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> After Krinkle fixed the generic deployment issues.
[12:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> We do need to get api.jqueryui.com showing the 1.12 docs though.
[12:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we just need to update this line? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/de2200e766f4757abdcbae439ad9c778223868c4/manifests/nodes/builder.pp#L63
[12:41:35] <scott_gonzalez> But I still don't know what the process is for infrastructure changes.
[12:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz or jzaefferer: Are either of you able to handle that?
[12:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> We should also make sure this process is documented in our release checklist.
[12:42:56] <arschmitz> sure
[12:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's all for today.
[12:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: This means that review of your PR is coming up soon :-)
[12:45:00] <fnagel> Nice....
[12:45:25] <fnagel> Next one is ready to be pushed :-)
[12:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> fantastic
[12:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> I want to get to 1.13 as fast as we can.
[12:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> PEP, Globalize, datepicker are the big things.
[12:46:26] <arschmitz> yup +1
[12:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to removing the events list on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137947/FrontPage ?
[12:48:00] <arschmitz> no
[12:48:02] <fnagel> no
[12:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
