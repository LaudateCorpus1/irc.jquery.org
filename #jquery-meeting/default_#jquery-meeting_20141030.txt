[11:05:16] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: thanks
[11:06:11] <arschmitz> so left to do for 1.4.5
[11:06:31] <arschmitz> i need to finish the change log its done execpt for the last few pr's gabriel_schulhof landed today
[11:06:39] <arschmitz> we need blog post
[11:06:45] <arschmitz> and the website updates
[11:08:06] <jasperdegroot> I can update the ThemeRoller right after the release
[11:08:14] <arschmitz> im going to finish the change log after the meeting and post a pr
[11:08:18] <jasperdegroot> (ZIP file needs to be on the server first)
[11:08:28] <arschmitz> if anyone gets a chance to take a look that would be great
[11:08:53] <gseguin> Updating the AUTHORS.txt right now
[11:09:00] <arschmitz> gseguin: thank you
[11:09:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: oh wait
[11:09:16] <gseguin> what?
[11:09:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: scott_gonzalez updated the task to actually update the list for us properly
[11:09:36] <arschmitz> not just check the last
[11:09:42] <arschmitz> so we should update and use that
[11:10:07] <gseguin> ok
[11:10:28] <gseguin> let me to that on master and cherry-pick it to 1.4-stable then
[11:10:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: sounds good
[11:11:31] <arschmitz> so lets try to release tomorrow
[11:12:43] <arschmitz> this is just another patch so im not worried about timing
[11:12:51] <arschmitz> and it being friday
[11:13:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: are you around tomorrow?
[11:14:04] <gseguin> I should be
[11:14:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: cool
[11:14:43] <arschmitz> ok anything else on 1.4.5?
[11:15:42] <arschmitz> ok so moving on to 1.5
[11:16:10] <arschmitz> this is mostly still held up by me
[11:16:48] <arschmitz> there has been a lot of progress its just an endless loop of updates with ui
[11:17:02] <arschmitz> and im trying to get classes landed asap so we can eliminate one step in this loop
[11:17:28] <arschmitz> There is however a few things to report
[11:18:10] <arschmitz> i created a widget factory extension that will handle all the boolean style options backcompat to classes with absicly a single line buy in
[11:18:24] <arschmitz> we will have to special case selectmenu
[11:18:43] <arschmitz> but other then that i think it will handle all the theme related deprecated options
[11:18:56] <jasperdegroot> nice
[11:19:28] <cgack> cool, can we start implementing it, or is it coming from ui?
[11:19:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: did i miss anything with that relating to what we talked about on it yesterday
[11:20:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No. I'll put your extension through its paces as soon as you grab the checkboxradio fix from UI.
[11:20:07] <arschmitz> no its in mobile i just need to adjust a few things gabriel_schulhof pointed out that i overlooked
[11:20:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: This iteration around, I'd like to have testability at every step.
[11:20:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats the idea
[11:21:02] <arschmitz> once i get these 1.4.5 things out of the way i think its just some simple things before i can push that
[11:21:17] <arschmitz> another backcompat related thing that came up is
[11:21:17] <gabriel_schulhof> We need to test both the effect of setting style options on the classes option and the effect on the style options of assigning style option classes to the classes option.
[11:21:33] <arschmitz> working with ui is how they handle backcompat
[11:21:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Can we use that in the tests as well?
[11:21:57] <arschmitz> they isolate all backcompat code into an extension wrapped in if( $.uiBackompat !== false )
[11:22:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes we should have tests for false
[11:22:29] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, if ( $.mobileBackcompat !== false ) { test(...); }
[11:22:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no
[11:22:49] <arschmitz> we will create seperate pages
[11:22:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaah, OK. That's good.
[11:24:05] <arschmitz> this means people can set this to false and turn off all deprecated code in the lib
[11:24:11] <arschmitz> to test upgrading their app
[11:24:59] <arschmitz> we will take an extra set and create separate modules to be able to exclude in a custom build
[11:25:01] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a good feature.
[11:25:36] <gabriel_schulhof> We're already doing this separate module thing to some extent. We have, for example, filterable.backcompat.
[11:26:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: not in the vast majority of places
[11:26:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Oooh! We can drop that in 1.5.0, right?
[11:26:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[11:26:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Niiiice!
[11:26:38] <gabriel_schulhof> That was some cringeworthy code.
[11:27:14] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:28:58] <arschmitz> ok so any 1.5 updates from any one else?
[11:29:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Not from me. I've been doing 1.4.5 all week.
[11:29:52] <arschmitz> ok jasperdegroot anything on the css update
[11:30:03] <jasperdegroot> not really
[11:30:10] <jasperdegroot> didn't have much time lately
[11:30:16] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok
[11:30:26] <jasperdegroot> but also kinda waiting until you are done with some of the steps
[11:30:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sure
[11:30:41] <arschmitz> ok so jsbin
[11:30:45] <cgack> i did just some minor adjustments
[11:31:17] <arschmitz> this is on hold for the time being
[11:31:43] <arschmitz> because we are going to be coming up with some bigger collaboration with jsbin
[11:31:57] <arschmitz> and we need to figure that out first
[11:33:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Bigger collaboration?
[11:33:42] <arschmitz> we had the first meeting of the new css framework
[11:34:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we want to switch all our website examples to open in it
[11:34:19] <arschmitz> and maybe stuff from the demos
[11:34:23] <arschmitz> and api
[11:36:10] <arschmitz> so speaking of collaborations
[11:36:14] <gabriel_schulhof> *whew*
[11:36:23] <arschmitz> we had our first meeting of the new css-framework
[11:36:35] <arschmitz> on wednesday
[11:36:44] <arschmitz> we had a pretty good turn out
[11:36:52] <arschmitz> from a bunch of projects
[11:36:55] <sfrisk> I thought it was Tuesday?
[11:37:00] <arschmitz> oh yeah sorry
[11:37:04] <arschmitz> it was
[11:37:18] <arschmitz> sfrisk: is helping with this also and was there :-)
[11:37:31] <lisa_deluca> "a bunch of projects" meaning other css frameworks?
[11:37:37] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yes
[11:37:45] <arschmitz> zurb foundation
[11:37:48] <arschmitz> famo.us
[11:37:52] <arschmitz> cascade.js
[11:37:59] <arschmitz> 960grid / unsemantic
[11:38:03] <arschmitz> cardinal css
[11:38:18] <arschmitz> not cascade.js lol
[11:38:56] <arschmitz> cascade framework
[11:39:03] <arschmitz> and topcoat
[11:39:35] <lisa_deluca> no bootstrap?
[11:39:38] <arschmitz> and of course UI and Mobile :-)
[11:39:46] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: no they are not interested
[11:40:21] <arschmitz> we tried for several months to collaborate with them and they declined
[11:41:59] <arschmitz> anyway so we are going to start a new frame work / standards set for frameworks
[11:42:14] <arschmitz> collaboration with any other frameworks that are interested
[11:42:47] <arschmitz> we sent invitations to about 30 including bootstrap and these are the ones that responded and showed up
[11:44:16] <arschmitz> so we have some progress on this now and next steps and everyone seems to agree and want to move forward
[11:44:56] <arschmitz> ok i think that about wraps this up unless anyone else has something?
[11:46:41] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[11:47:13] <lisa_deluca> so does next week go to 1.4.6?  or everything from here on is 1.5?
[11:47:23] <arschmitz> everything 1.5
[11:47:29] <lisa_deluca> thanks
[11:47:31] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: we had not intedned to do a 1.4.5
[11:47:44] <arschmitz> but there were some bad ios8 issues that we could not leave
[11:48:57] <arschmitz> anything else?
[11:49:16] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back on -dev
