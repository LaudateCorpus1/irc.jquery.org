[09:18:01] <gnarf> m_gol: Pre-check for pull requests
[09:18:17] <gnarf> was reading over last weeks notes and saw that
[09:18:45] <m_gol> yep, Angular guys have sth for automatically checking if CLA is signed etc.
[09:18:58] <m_gol> https://github.com/btford/mary-poppins
[09:19:33] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez
[09:19:51] <gnarf> m_gol so it wasn't about running the units on the pull, just the cla stuffs?
[09:20:35] <gnarf> I just want to put it out there that we must be VERY careful with pull request automated testing - it's way too easy to add code to be executed as jenkins
[09:20:53] <gnarf> i.e. in the gruntfile, rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins
[09:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: I don't see anything about CLAs in there.
[09:21:51] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: well, they use it for checking CLAs
[09:21:55] <m_gol> amongst other things
[09:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> So, umm...that sounds super generic and unhelpful :-P
[09:22:25] <m_gol> gnarf: oh god, really? So how does it work currently?
[09:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> Unless there's some actual code for us to look at.
[09:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I already have a grunt task that checks CLAs for jQuery projects.
[09:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> But we can't use it until the existing code actually has full CLA coverage.
[09:23:09] <m_gol> great :)
[09:23:15] <m_gol> right
[09:23:26] <m_gol> how many are we missing?
[09:23:32] <gnarf> m_gol: Travis runs everything in an VM
[09:23:34] <gnarf> so its safer
[09:23:34] <scott_gonzalez> hundreds
[09:23:59] <m_gol> gnarf: but we use Jenkins, not Travis on testswarm
[09:24:02] <gnarf> Travis also doesn't run the unit tests currently
[09:24:04] <m_gol> :(
[09:24:14] <gnarf> m_gol jenkins only runs against master / 1.x
[09:24:17] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: that doesn't sound very safe to us
[09:24:21] <gnarf> m_gol - not pull requests
[09:24:23] <m_gol> gnarf: ah, ok
[09:24:25] <m_gol> right
[09:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: What do you mean?
[09:25:41] <m_gol> well, if we have commits by people that didn't sign CLA
[09:25:58] <m_gol> it seems like possible trouble
[09:26:16] <gnarf> ranging in age over times when there wasn't a CLA step
[09:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> Less trouble than any previous year.
[09:34:13] <m_gol> where are we with the move to Sauce Labs?
[09:35:55] <gnarf> dunno myself
[09:36:34] <markelog> yep
[09:36:47] <markelog> sorry wrong window
[09:37:16] <gnarf> do we have other "meeting" discussion?
[09:37:20] <gnarf> or should i close up the room
[09:46:20] <m_gol> aaah, I mistook the tabs
[09:47:30] <m_gol> ok, I wrote to Krinkle on dev, I guess we'll have to wait for him
[09:53:00] <m_gol> ok, we'll have to discuss the rest with DaveMethvin, I guess
[09:53:13] <m_gol> so unless anyone has anything else for now on the plate, speak now ;)
[09:54:34] <m_gol> ok, so I guess you can close it up, gnarf, thanks!
