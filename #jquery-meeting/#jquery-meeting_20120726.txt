[11:02:33] <toddparker> hi
[11:02:38] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:02:38] <gseguin> hello
[11:02:40] * _|Nix|_ waves
[11:02:47] <toddparker> the jQuery Mobile team meeting is kicking off
[11:02:52] <toddparker> sound off if you're here
[11:02:53] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:03:00] <johnbender> ahoy
[11:03:06] <toddparker> agenda - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gDVpFYo5q5MV7aI0d5qTYNLvSxbVBX_fFEpehKmedKw/edit#
[11:03:28] <toddparker> i'll start off
[11:03:35] <toddparker> 1.2 alpha almost ready to go - writing the blog post now
[11:03:50] <toddparker> aiming for friday or monday as a release
[11:04:03] <toddparker> we can revisit after we discuss the specific open items
[11:04:31] <toddparker> agcolom is going to help document the collapsible methods now
[11:04:58] <toddparker> once 1.2 is out, i'll be focusing on hammering out a roadmap with you all
[11:05:02] <toddparker> collecting stuff now
[11:05:17] <toddparker> hopefully, we can get 1.2 final within 3-4 weeks
[11:05:19] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Then you'll like my pie-in-the-sky section :)
[11:05:34] <toddparker> been spending more time pre-alpha to get the popup API stuff just right
[11:05:44] <toddparker> i'm feeling really good about where we are
[11:05:52] <toddparker> saw that :)
[11:06:06] <toddparker> before i hand off, i had one item that i wanted us to look at
[11:06:07] <toddparker> slider change event - start/stop - add for 1.2? - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1589
[11:06:08] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1589 on jquery-mobile (tenor; 1y, 2m ago): Feature Request: Slider Change Event
[11:06:31] <toddparker> people have been asking for this for a long time…wonder if we can try and get this in
[11:06:40] <toddparker> seems pretty straightforward
[11:07:38] <uGoMobi> has JasonDScott been able to work on this?
[11:07:41] <toddparker> so we have change but it's chatty
[11:07:45] <uGoMobi> I see he is assigned
[11:07:50] <toddparker> people want to know when you've released the handle
[11:08:04] <toddparker> i haven't heard from him in a while
[11:08:12] <JasonDScott> Hi
[11:08:19] <JasonDScott> Sorry guys
[11:08:23] <uGoMobi> hi JasonDScott
[11:08:26] <toddparker> hey JasonDScott!
[11:08:35] <JasonDScott> I have not been able to look at it yet
[11:08:47] <toddparker> this was suggested
[11:08:50] <toddparker> $(document).on({
[11:08:50] <toddparker>     "mousedown touchstart": function () {
[11:08:52] <JasonDScott> I should be freeing up after this week
[11:08:52] <toddparker>         $(this).siblings('input').trigger('start');
[11:08:53] <toddparker>     },
[11:08:55] <toddparker>     "mouseup touchend": function () {
[11:08:56] <toddparker>         $(this).siblings('input').trigger('stop');
[11:08:57] <toddparker>     }
[11:08:58] <toddparker> }, ".ui-slider");
[11:09:10] <toddparker> basically a way to bind to when he slider starts being moved and when it stops
[11:09:22] <toddparker> ok JasonDScott
[11:09:33] <toddparker> just wanted to get opinions on this addition
[11:09:53] <johnbender> well it would be _trigger
[11:10:01] <johnbender> side note
[11:10:04] <johnbender> hmm
[11:10:18] <toddparker> sure
[11:10:27] <johnbender> seems odd to have a "change" function in there at all
[11:10:51] <toddparker> why's that?
[11:11:00] <johnbender> well why don't we just proxy the event
[11:11:12] <johnbender> on change _trigger("change"
[11:11:16] <johnbender> so it's namespaced
[11:11:41] <johnbender> I assume that was originally meant to replacement for that type of functionality anyway right?
[11:11:51] <johnbender> people are used to binding to change
[11:12:02] <johnbender> maybe I'm crazy
[11:12:11] <toddparker> this is what kin added - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4fa6ccdc0d8625f58e43e446f24bc4e65f87cb1d
[11:12:12] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Kin Blas (10m, 3d ago): Fix for issue 2315 - Flip toggle switch with change event bound, triggers multiple times  - Modified refresh() so that it checks to see if the value actually changed before firing off the "change" event.
[11:12:43] <johnbender> ah so it does proxy
[11:12:56] <johnbender> sorry I thought we used the change callback suggested in the original issue text
[11:13:04] <toddparker> actually, that's confusing. commit was for flip and this ticket is slider. but i goes they build on each other
[11:13:06] <johnbender> it appears that kin and I are of like mind
[11:13:08] <toddparker> but yeah
[11:13:13] <toddparker> genius!
[11:13:13] <johnbender> kk
[11:13:17] <uGoMobi> but isn't the problem that when you slide the slider handle the change event is fired multiple times (every step)
[11:13:37] <toddparker> yeah, up dates the input as you move and fires off change
[11:13:47] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:13:49] <johnbender> that's not wrong
[11:13:54] <johnbender> and someone might want that
[11:14:02] <johnbender> but I get the point
[11:14:02] <toddparker> which is very chatty if you want to re-run something expensive or save it back to the server or whatever
[11:14:05] <johnbender> people want the simple thing
[11:14:22] <toddparker> "i'm done moving the slider"
[11:14:26] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:14:26] <johnbender> right
[11:14:35] <toddparker> well, done for now :)
[11:14:38] <johnbender> are people going to expect that to work when changing the field value ?
[11:14:52] <johnbender> eg, clicking and holding the up and own buttons?
[11:15:36] <toddparker> updating the value would change the slider position, and both change and start>stop
[11:15:45] <toddparker> so yes
[11:15:53] <johnbender> toddparker: well when you click and hold it doesn't update teh slider currently in chrome
[11:15:55] <toddparker> at least i think so
[11:16:03] <johnbender> only on unfocus
[11:16:08] <toddparker> huh
[11:16:18] <johnbender> I'm guessing the change doesn't fire until you defocus
[11:16:20] <johnbender> but I could be wrong
[11:16:47] <toddparker> so even tho the value updates, change doesn't fire until mouseup touchend
[11:16:59] <toddparker> defocus is really late
[11:17:09] <toddparker> looks like this needs some investigation
[11:17:23] <toddparker> dunno if you have time to give this a look johnbender
[11:17:28] <johnbender> toddparker: that is a separate issue though
[11:17:34] <toddparker> seems you have opinions which is good
[11:17:38] <johnbender> toddparker: you can give it to me
[11:17:41] <toddparker> yes it is
[11:17:47] <johnbender> I'll need a break from the IE stuff at some point anyway
[11:17:53] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:17:58] <toddparker> but we should just look at all the events to see if they make sense
[11:18:02] <toddparker> good
[11:18:07] <toddparker> ok, i'll shut up now
[11:18:10] <johnbender> toddparker: why don't you assign both to me
[11:18:27] <toddparker> ok
[11:18:41] <toddparker> there isn't an issue for what you just described
[11:18:44] <toddparker> so just one
[11:19:07] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[11:19:09] <toddparker> assigned
[11:19:18] <toddparker> gseguin: how goes?
[11:19:25] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll add another one for the late change on input alteration
[11:19:33] <toddparker> perfect
[11:19:38] <gseguin> better, craziness  almost over
[11:19:53] <toddparker> :)
[11:20:22] <toddparker> once you're settled, that list view filter stuff is next
[11:20:28] <gseguin> I'm porting the metadata extraction code to the plugins .jquery.json generation that Bender pushed yesterday
[11:20:31] <toddparker> we can add that between alpha if needed
[11:20:36] <gseguin> then listview
[11:20:38] <toddparker> right. that's first
[11:20:45] <toddparker> how
[11:20:50] <toddparker> how's colorado?
[11:20:59] <gseguin> Sunny and hot!
[11:21:12] <toddparker> nice
[11:21:13] <gseguin> in other words: awesome!
[11:21:18] <toddparker> jealous
[11:21:28] <toddparker> alright
[11:21:40] <gseguin> that's it for me
[11:21:48] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: let's have you go last, i see a lot of stuff there :)
[11:21:55] <toddparker> uGoMobi: next...
[11:21:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: NP. Sure.
[11:22:10] <uGoMobi> finished collapsible stuff
[11:22:21] <toddparker> that looks great
[11:22:25] <uGoMobi> and related... listviews in collapsibles
[11:22:42] <toddparker> collapsible lists: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-collapsible.html
[11:22:53] <uGoMobi> I didn't finished controlgroup issue yet
[11:23:04] <uGoMobi> want to do that next
[11:23:16] <toddparker> ah, i see
[11:23:18] <toddparker> ok
[11:23:32] <toddparker> you also have those cool popup demos to add in, right?
[11:23:34] <uGoMobi> and popup code examples
[11:24:00] <uGoMobi> now code is final for alpha I can finish those and add them to the docs
[11:24:02] <toddparker> btw - current popup page is looking great
[11:24:02] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[11:24:38] <uGoMobi> forgot to add to the agenda... Opera transitions
[11:24:39] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:24:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, right you are
[11:24:43] <johnbender> oops
[11:24:46] <johnbender> wrong channel
[11:24:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[11:25:09] <toddparker> right, we need to re-visit that
[11:25:20] <toddparker> issue #?
[11:25:47] <uGoMobi> hang on
[11:26:10] <toddparker> ok
[11:26:23] <toddparker> i just want that link for posterity
[11:26:46] <uGoMobi> I think we only have that close Opera 12 bug ticket
[11:26:58] <uGoMobi> can't find it right now :(
[11:26:59] <toddparker> right - that's true
[11:27:12] <toddparker> that works, or we can open a new one
[11:27:41] <toddparker> we can just add it to the agenda doc
[11:27:43] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4521
[11:27:44] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4521 on jquery-mobile (chrisben; 1m, 1w ago): navigation broken in Opera12
[11:28:06] <uGoMobi> it's closed but we can reopen it and rename it
[11:28:15] <toddparker> ok, let's do that
[11:28:18] <uGoMobi> has useful info from miketaylr
[11:28:21] <toddparker> i added to the agenda
[11:28:23] <toddparker> yeah
[11:28:33] <toddparker> i'm working with him on that too
[11:28:39] <toddparker> update soon
[11:28:48] <toddparker> anything else uGoMobi?
[11:28:57] <uGoMobi> no, that's it for me
[11:29:02] <toddparker> cool, thanks
[11:29:15] <toddparker> agcolom: how are thing in the docs?
[11:29:23] <agcolom> good
[11:29:50] <agcolom> I've been working on the api docs, and had a lot of interaction with the jQuery UI guys
[11:30:05] <agcolom> inished collapsible and checkboxes in api docs with inline examples
[11:30:05] <agcolom>     now need to add inline examples to select, radio buttons, collapsible sets, search input, switch, slider and dialog
[11:30:13] <toddparker> you're up to 9 API docs roughed out?
[11:30:19] <agcolom> yes 9
[11:30:22] <toddparker> nice
[11:30:28] <agcolom> 2 with full inline examples
[11:30:47] <toddparker> great
[11:30:48] <agcolom> the others won't take too long
[11:30:52] <toddparker> good to hear
[11:31:00] <agcolom> we need to discuss jQuery html standard
[11:31:10] <toddparker> when you find a correction, do you port it over to the current docs?
[11:31:13] <agcolom> i.e. do we follow it?
[11:31:20] <agcolom> yes I do
[11:31:23] <toddparker> sounds like that will be documented soon
[11:31:28] <toddparker> yes, we'll follow it
[11:31:42] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I already removed a bunch of type="text/javascript" from some <script> tags.
[11:31:45] <agcolom> ok, so when? (currently we have self closing tags
[11:31:48] <toddparker> should be pretty easy to knock off most of it
[11:31:54] <toddparker> doctyle capitalization, etc
[11:32:19] <toddparker> we could do a big find/replace
[11:32:21] <agcolom> ok, when do we change this in the docs?
[11:32:57] <agcolom> otherwise, Raised some issues with the jQuery UI team regarding the API site (code highlighting, NAN in code line numbering). 1st issue is fixed. 2nd will be soon.
[11:33:07] <agcolom> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js still old (16th July)
[11:33:23] <agcolom> johnbender may be able to help with this one?
[11:33:43] <johnbender> agcolom: agh, I'm a jackass I need to refresh the cdn
[11:33:53] <agcolom> ok, cool, thx :-)
[11:33:57] <agcolom> Discussed jsbin with Remy Sharp. We can now view jQuery Mobile code in Output panel, except in FF. Remy has filed a bug report with Mozilla to get this sorted: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777526
[11:34:14] <toddparker> for latest johnbender
[11:34:27] <agcolom> but the new jsbin takes some practice to get used to :-)
[11:34:44] <toddparker> it does!
[11:34:45] <agcolom> better if you're logged in. Nice features
[11:34:53] <toddparker> indeed. still my favorite
[11:35:19] <agcolom> also added some videos from JQconf SF on hte resources page
[11:35:20] <gseguin> but it's awesome! remote rendering is genius
[11:35:31] <agcolom> absolutely!
[11:35:38] <toddparker> yeah
[11:35:39] <agcolom> and finally, Will be on holiday from tomorrow and will be on/off internet. Highly likely that I will not be online next thursday for the meeting. I will be online again around 8th August - 23rd August. Then off again and finally back at work on the 6th
[11:36:02] <toddparker> love those european vacations
[11:36:07] <toddparker> where are you off to?
[11:36:35] <agcolom> France! Paris first and then to my little paradise in the South of France (Provence)
[11:36:52] <agcolom> Will send you some nice pictures ;-)
[11:36:55] <gseguin> lucky you
[11:37:08] <toddparker> nice
[11:37:14] <toddparker> we'll miss you
[11:37:24] <agcolom> Yes, I get 35days off at the university + bank holidays + 3.5 extra days at Xmas!
[11:37:31] <toddparker> wow
[11:37:42] <agcolom> Can't complain ;-)
[11:37:54] <toddparker> seriously
[11:37:59] <toddparker> ok…_|Nix|_
[11:38:03] <toddparker> you're up
[11:38:10] * _|Nix|_ go check agenda
[11:38:11] <agcolom> When I'm in Provence, I'm at my parents and they have good broadband, so will be online doing the docs api
[11:38:18] <toddparker> nice
[11:38:24] <toddparker> don't work too hard
[11:38:27] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4649
[11:38:28] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4649 on jquery-mobile (frequent; 2w, 6d ago): feature request: fallback alert/confirm on popups
[11:39:02] <_|Nix|_> 1. People are asking for an option to not cause the popup to close when the user clicks on the screen. I've suggested that we handle this via an event/preventDefault(). Perhaps "popupbeforeclose" ...
[11:39:15] <_|Nix|_> ... much to johnbender's delight, no doubt.
[11:39:58] <_|Nix|_> So, that's one item for discussion.
[11:40:03] <toddparker> but the back button is still there
[11:40:07] <toddparker> and will be a problem
[11:40:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yes, but we can do one of those where it goes forward again automatically.
[11:40:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Probably not too nice though.
[11:40:49] <toddparker> i think this is worth discussing, but as a later enhancement
[11:41:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, let's leave it for post-1.2 ...
[11:41:06] <toddparker> cool
[11:41:20] <toddparker> we discussed this idea a while ago. i see a use case
[11:41:34] <toddparker> but the nav model stuff needs to be considered…might get complex
[11:41:58] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: before we go on, i was just testing /test/ and the popup positioning seems way off
[11:41:59] <_|Nix|_> 2. Reposition ... seems OK, but we need to test on lots more devices than just Android 2.3.5 and iOS 5.1.1 before we can say that repositioning works satisfactorily.
[11:42:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Oh, OK. On what device?
[11:42:15] <toddparker> on an iPad, it opens too far above
[11:42:25] <toddparker> recent regression
[11:42:42] <toddparker> ipad 3, ios5
[11:42:52] <uGoMobi> all popup examples?
[11:42:56] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: *sigh* ... works fine on iPod with iOS 5.1.1 ... dunno how I'm going to test.
[11:43:03] <toddparker> custom select is also affected (obviously)
[11:43:20] <toddparker> really? both our iPads are off
[11:43:22] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, is this the initial positioning or the orientationchange-induced repositioning?
[11:43:28] <toddparker> localhost of /test/
[11:43:37] <toddparker> initial positioning
[11:44:15] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK ... might be the window-height-is-wrong-via-jQuery thing ... I dunno ...
[11:44:17] <uGoMobi> does it matter if you load page in landscape or portrait?
[11:44:23] <uGoMobi> or both off?
[11:44:35] <toddparker> see tooltip, menu, etc.
[11:44:39] <toddparker> first example is ok
[11:44:56] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That's probably because the rest of the examples are at a scrollTop > 0 ...
[11:45:12] * _|Nix|_ slappin' on the guesses ...
[11:45:17] <toddparker> right
[11:45:23] <toddparker> that's it
[11:45:29] <toddparker> it was fine yesterday
[11:45:33] <toddparker> something new
[11:45:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: *grrr* ... wish I had an iPad 3 ...
[11:46:01] <toddparker> shows up on all ipads
[11:46:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, good ... I'll try to scrounge one up at the office ...
[11:46:34] <toddparker> ok
[11:46:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: it'd be nice if you could identify the commit that broke it ...
[11:46:38] <toddparker> back to business
[11:46:45] <toddparker> i'll try
[11:46:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: bisect?
[11:47:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... bisect, refresh, click on popup, mark as good/bad, refresh, click on popup, ...
[11:47:28] <toddparker> can anyone else repo that?
[11:48:25] <toddparker> oddly, it's ok on my iphone
[11:48:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... and my iPod ... both have a narrow screen, so some media queries might be kicking in which are absent on the iPad.
[11:49:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... might be affecting reported window size.
[11:49:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: *shrug*
[11:49:20] <toddparker> yeah, could be
[11:49:48] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4723
[11:49:48] <uGoMobi> if that was the case they should be off on desktop as well
[11:49:49] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4723 on jquery-mobile (gabrielschulhof; 1w, 8h ago): popup: Reposition upon orientationchange
[11:50:26] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, we need to close this when all's well in orientationchange land ... but I guess that's premature :)
[11:50:52] <toddparker> we can test today
[11:50:59] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Cool!
[11:51:11] <toddparker> think it's solid
[11:51:24] <toddparker> the position bug on iPad is only for origin
[11:51:26] <_|Nix|_> The only remaining thing (aside from the pie-in-the-sky section) is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4595 ... can we close that?
[11:51:27] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4595 on jquery-mobile (DzenisevichK; 1m, 3d ago): Popup causes navigation back from a redirected page
[11:51:28] <gseguin> I just tested on iPad3 and the popup disappears when I change orientation
[11:51:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Dang!
[11:51:50] <toddparker> is it zooming in?
[11:51:51] <gseguin> comes back when I restore orientation to original
[11:52:06] <gseguin> oh wait
[11:52:11] <toddparker> or is the zoom fix kicking in?
[11:52:18] <gseguin> the second time I changed orientation it was there
[11:52:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That's the st00pid thing with my iPod too - sometimes it zooms in, sometimes it does not.
[11:52:24] <gseguin> not at the right pposition
[11:52:27] <gseguin> but there
[11:52:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: After an orientation change, it's supposed to be centered in the window.
[11:52:46] <toddparker> our fix watches for accelerometer movement and temporary locks user zoom
[11:52:54] <toddparker> if you move too fast, we miss it
[11:53:01] <gseguin> ok that's what happened then
[11:53:09] <toddparker> iPad is worse than iphone
[11:53:21] <toddparker> they send out different tolerances
[11:54:27] <toddparker> let's look at this after this
[11:54:32] <toddparker> something is wacky
[11:54:49] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4595
[11:54:50] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4595 on jquery-mobile (DzenisevichK; 1m, 3d ago): Popup causes navigation back from a redirected page
[11:55:33] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. We need to agree that we can close that.
[11:55:49] <toddparker> that is a can or worms
[11:56:05] <toddparker> i'd like to leave it open to see if we can give this a look later
[11:56:18] <toddparker> the custom select scenario is a problem
[11:56:23] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... which is why we decided to not support navigation that involves pages added without a hash ...
[11:57:16] <toddparker> i know which is why i don't want to tackle this now
[11:57:33] <toddparker> but there is a lot of good info in that issue and i want to keep this on our radar for now
[11:57:38] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The problem is that the dev is adding pages with changeHash: false, so both dialogs and popups slip up.
[11:57:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, but not for 1.2 ...
[11:57:54] <_|Nix|_> ... or?
[11:58:51] <toddparker> johnbender: I think you latest commit hosed something
[11:59:37] <toddparker> ah, so it's only under those conditions? then that isn't supported and not ever be
[11:59:51] <johnbender> toddparker: yah, bash issue
[11:59:54] <johnbender> should be fixed in a sec
[11:59:59] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Are you referring to #4595?
[12:00:07] <toddparker> i think back button support is so important on these platforms
[12:00:28] <toddparker> yes
[12:00:44] <toddparker> that issue is only with hash change off, right?
[12:00:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah ... if you choose to add pages with changeHash: false, you're pretty much on your own, I'd say ...
[12:00:50] <toddparker> agreed
[12:00:57] <toddparker> ok, i'm convinced. close it.
[12:01:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We might want to provide a way to /replace/ a page ... so we replace the URL in the urlHistory entry.
[12:01:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Thus, when we encounter a certain hash key we map it to a different page than we originally did.
[12:01:48] <toddparker> that might be worth thinking about as an enhancement
[12:01:55] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But that will make copying/pasting URLs and cleaning up URLs complicated.
[12:02:03] <toddparker> indeed
[12:02:33] <toddparker> so other than this new position problem with tablets, are we feature complete on popup?
[12:02:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: AFAICT.
[12:02:50] <toddparker> the pie in the sky stuff seems like later items
[12:03:09] <toddparker> me too. great
[12:03:23] <toddparker> mind if we discuss those in -dev since we're at 3 already?
[12:03:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah ... and I didn't even mention the on-the-fly options, though those are less pie-in-the-sky, because I already have a PR that needs some heavy updating, but is otherwise OK.
[12:03:43] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: NP.
[12:04:36] <_|Nix|_> OK, so, I guess I'm done.
[12:04:59] <toddparker> right. good stuff, but roadmap items
[12:05:21] <toddparker> ok, any other items to discuss? questions from the community?
[12:06:05] <toddparker> ok, guess we can wrap up then
[12:06:17] <toddparker> thanks everyone. can't wait to get 1.2 out in the wild
[12:06:31] <toddparker> over and out
[12:06:45] <gseguin> see y'all on -dev
[12:06:50] <_|Nix|_> Back on -dev ...
