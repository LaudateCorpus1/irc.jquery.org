[09:03:37] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:03:39] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:04:51] <timmywil> hola
[09:05:12] <rwaldron> Oh hai!
[09:05:45] <gnarf> hey
[09:06:03] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[09:06:24] <DaveMethvin> ok, just getting a late start on the agenda
[09:06:31] <DaveMethvin> we did make some progress last week
[09:07:07] <DaveMethvin> that link in the agenda has all the open tix for 1.8
[09:07:26] <mikesherov> here
[09:07:29] <DaveMethvin> hey
[09:07:39] <DaveMethvin> so that link in the agenda has all the open tix for 1.8
[09:08:03] <DaveMethvin> we should either have a plan for fixing them in the next coupla weeks or figure out a way to kick them down the road
[09:08:06] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> i'm already plotting a few of those
[09:08:43] <DaveMethvin> for 1.8 my main concern is to nail down the big picture, like what we'll deprecate
[09:08:59] <timmywil> I am making some more progress on Sizzle, but not ready to push yet. I should be able to show more Tuesday
[09:09:16] <DaveMethvin> sounds good timmywil
[09:09:32] <DaveMethvin> if you have some way to do it in a couple of stages that would be good
[09:09:37] <DaveMethvin> just in case you run out of time
[09:09:51] <DaveMethvin> at least we  have a pretty good set of unit tests now
[09:10:16] <DaveMethvin> i think if we start the ie6 tests now they will finish by the time we release
[09:10:43] <DaveMethvin> i just created a ticket for the modularity issue
[09:11:02] <DaveMethvin> about halfway through typing it i realized it's most likely 3 different tickets
[09:11:15] <DaveMethvin> build, ajax modularity, effects modularity
[09:11:32] <DaveMethvin> or at least, could be worked on by different ppl
[09:12:10] <DaveMethvin> gnarf can you look at the effects?
[09:12:28] <DaveMethvin> i'll try to rope jaubourg into the ajax part
[09:13:01] <gnarf> meaning?
[09:13:49] <DaveMethvin> the ability to do a build without effects in
[09:14:14] <DaveMethvin> may need some tweaks to the unit tests for example if some other unit uses hide/show
[09:14:14] <gnarf> sure
[09:14:53] <DaveMethvin> but basically the idea would be that someone could build their own jquery but leave out effects, altho we'd still want to be able to unit test that subset
[09:15:12] <gnarf> hopefully its just removing effects.js unit
[09:15:13] <gnarf> ;)
[09:15:28] <DaveMethvin> i played around and it seems like about 90% there by doing that
[09:15:31] <mikesherov> there are a couple of selectors that effects provides to sizzle
[09:15:39] <gnarf> just :animated afaik
[09:15:47] <mikesherov> :hidden
[09:15:59] <mikesherov> or not
[09:16:02] <DaveMethvin> :hidden too?
[09:16:14] <gnarf> i uses :hidden, but i think thats in sizzle
[09:16:20] <DaveMethvin> and i would be ok with :animated failing if you left off animations
[09:16:21] <mikesherov> I see
[09:17:04] <timmywil> :hidden is in css
[09:17:36] <gnarf> mikesherov: RE: the "tick" function - does your comment on that pull mean you see people duck punching animation.tick as an extension point?
[09:18:31] <mikesherov> I don't see anything per se
[09:18:45] <mikesherov> I was just saying that we should do whatever is the least confusing for the end developer
[09:18:56] <mikesherov> and I don't know what that is :-)
[09:19:38] <gnarf> Well hopefully in the next week or two I can start working on some plugins using the 1.8 effects code
[09:19:46] <mikesherov> so DaveMethvin, we've been closing some tixx as "landed in 1.8pre", and leaving others open
[09:20:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah i noticed that, tried to close a few more over the weekend
[09:20:09] <DaveMethvin> if i had to do it all over again,
[09:20:13] <DaveMethvin> i would develop in master
[09:20:16] * gnarf winks
[09:20:29] <DaveMethvin> hell, we could do that now
[09:20:38] <gnarf> we could
[09:20:42] <DaveMethvin> once it all lands there it should close anything we missed
[09:20:45] <gnarf> it would get the "git" users testing 1.8 too
[09:21:00] <gnarf> you can still branch stable and push it first
[09:21:22] <DaveMethvin> stable is tagged already, any reason to do more than that?
[09:21:33] * DaveMethvin bows before gnarf's git knowledge
[09:21:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if we need to fix a bug in 1.7 before 1.8 releases
[09:22:00] <gnarf> we have a branch for it
[09:22:12] <gnarf> tag is probably safe enough anyway
[09:22:23] <gnarf> we can always branch off of it when we need to fix said bug
[09:22:28] <DaveMethvin> but we could pull the 1.7.2 tag, cherry-pick the patch, and push to a 1.7.3, right?
[09:22:35] <mikesherov> right
[09:22:58] <mikesherov> so, anyway....
[09:23:14] <gnarf> sure - presumably, the reason to have a branch is that there is more development happening than a single commit on the "stable" branch
[09:23:26] <gnarf> its git tho
[09:23:33] <gnarf> we have our butts covered if you want to merge
[09:23:36] <mikesherov> right, it's all spaghetti anyway :-P
[09:24:02] <DaveMethvin> well we may be developing on two branches at some point, but for now it's only one
[09:24:05] * DaveMethvin winks
[09:24:22] <gnarf> ?ts
[09:24:23] <bot-t> That's Sexualâ„¢
[09:24:32] <DaveMethvin> hah
[09:24:40] <DaveMethvin> okay, let's see what else we need to do here
[09:24:44] <mikesherov> OK, so are we still on the "these are all the 1.8 tickets" point?
[09:24:58] <gnarf> I have been going over all the effects tickets again
[09:25:16] <gnarf> is anyone else up for a open tickets review?
[09:25:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah there are two piles
[09:25:32] <mikesherov> Yes!
[09:25:34] <DaveMethvin> the ones open for 1.8
[09:25:39] <gnarf> cuz I'd like to sit in and go over all the open bugs
[09:25:40] <DaveMethvin> and the ones open otehrwise
[09:25:50] <DaveMethvin> lessee what we have
[09:26:10] <gnarf> do we have a good report for this?
[09:26:28] <DaveMethvin> we have the 1.8 report
[09:26:35] <DaveMethvin> and then we have open bugs/tickets by component
[09:26:57] <DaveMethvin> i have been commenting on tix as i review them
[09:27:07] <DaveMethvin> you've probably seen your inbox litered
[09:27:13] <mikesherov> what's the difference between an assigned ticket, and an open ticket with an owner?
[09:27:50] <gnarf> is the owner one of us? it should prolly be assigned
[09:27:51] <gnarf> :)
[09:28:47] <mikesherov> 9521 and 9385
[09:28:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do we really like "addBack"
[09:28:57] <gnarf> the name feels "meh"
[09:29:05] <ajpiano> +1
[09:29:16] <DaveMethvin> but you have to say it's better than andSelf tho
[09:29:27] <mikesherov> yes
[09:29:34] <DaveMethvin> and it's using add
[09:29:38] <DaveMethvin> so it's adding something to the set
[09:29:48] <DaveMethvin> what is it adding and what should we call that?
[09:29:54] <ajpiano> addLast ?
[09:30:25] <gnarf> endJoin()
[09:30:27] <DaveMethvin> Last works for me, i think we should avoid Prev since .prev means something else
[09:30:45] * gnarf laughs
[09:30:49] <gnarf> naming!
[09:30:51] <DaveMethvin> no, endJoin implies ending
[09:30:57] <ajpiano> heh DaveMethvin yeah my next suggestion was addPrev but then sat on it for just that reason
[09:31:09] <mikesherov> only 2 hard things in programming: naming is one of them
[09:31:15] <eddiemonge> addLast sounds like add last-chid
[09:31:37] <DaveMethvin> well, dump a bunch of suggestion names into the ticket
[09:31:43] <gnarf> k
[09:31:44] <mikesherov> great
[09:32:23] <mikesherov> that's the best way forward at the moment, I have a question on 11696
[09:32:34] <mikesherov> ?11696
[09:32:42] <DaveMethvin> damn bots
[09:32:46] <gnarf> docs#11696
[09:32:59] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11696
[09:34:00] <mikesherov> so, it's Safari 5.0
[09:34:09] <mikesherov> what versions of Safari do we support
[09:34:29] <mikesherov> do we support 4 and 5.0?
[09:35:14] <DaveMethvin> well how big a market share does 5.0 have?
[09:35:40] <DaveMethvin> i think our logic behind x and x-1 for everyone but IE was that upgrades happened really fast
[09:36:01] <DaveMethvin> but if that's not true and 5.0 has 20% share then we may need to rethink
[09:36:20] <mikesherov> right, but again, we still haven't discussed what a "version" is for safari
[09:36:37] <mikesherov> is 5.1.7 a different version from 5.1.5?
[09:36:48] <DaveMethvin> back to our logic i think
[09:37:10] <DaveMethvin> is there a lot of 5.1.5 out there?
[09:37:17] <DaveMethvin> if so we prolly need to support it
[09:37:31] <DaveMethvin> i'm not as much set on version numbers as market share
[09:37:51] <DaveMethvin> the version numbers were there to simplify our thought process but not to dictate it
[09:38:06] <DaveMethvin> but i don't know how safari versions are in the wild
[09:38:38] <mikesherov> yeah, and I think we need to separate out Safari desktop from mobile as well
[09:38:43] <DaveMethvin> well this is useless: http://www.statowl.com/web_browser_usage_by_version.php?timeframe=last_6&interval=month&chart_id=4&limit%5B%5D=safari&fltr_os=&fltr_se=&fltr_cn=
[09:39:04] <DaveMethvin> ah here we go: http://www.statowl.com/web_browser_usage_by_subversion.php?1=1&timeframe=last_6&interval=month&chart_id=4&fltr_br=&fltr_os=&fltr_se=&fltr_cn=&holder%5B%5D=safari&limit%5B%5D=5
[09:39:46] <mikesherov> looks like 5.0.* is about 15% of safari share
[09:39:56] <mikesherov> safari itself is like 5% share
[09:40:38] <DaveMethvin> so that's a pretty small number
[09:40:43] <mikesherov> yes.
[09:40:51] <mikesherov> but how reputable is statsowl?
[09:41:14] <DaveMethvin> well they gave us the answer we wanted
[09:41:22] <DaveMethvin> so i'd say pretty damn reputable
[09:41:25] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:42:53] <DaveMethvin> if there isn't an obvious fix for this, or it will take a lot of bytes, I'd say let's just close it wontfix
[09:43:12] <mikesherov> OK, will do
[09:43:16] <mikesherov> I'll spend an hour at most
[09:43:32] <DaveMethvin> does that mean there are quirks with some apis in 5.0? yes. but in general jQuery still works on 5.0
[09:43:49] <DaveMethvin> and by the time 1.8 comes out the 5.0 share will be even smaller
[09:44:05] <DaveMethvin> we know that the other browsers fall off a lot faster than ie
[09:44:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do we need to wait on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10544 - or did we deprecate this in 1.7?
[09:45:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw that last night gnarf, lemme check the 1.7 blog
[09:46:19] <DaveMethvin> gnarf we didn't deprecate the data events in 1.7
[09:46:25] <DaveMethvin> so that was slated for 1.8
[09:46:29] <DaveMethvin> and removal in 1.9
[09:46:41] <gnarf> k
[09:46:53] <DaveMethvin> but we should be really aggressive with deprecating whatever we might want to throw out
[09:47:07] <DaveMethvin> so that we have the ability to remove it (or not) in 1.9
[09:47:17] <DaveMethvin> otherwise we have to wait yet another whole cycle
[09:48:24] <mikesherov> 10996 and 11004 are landed in 1.8pre already
[09:49:07] <DaveMethvin> I'll test out the auto-close when I land in master
[09:49:54] <mikesherov> k
[09:49:58] <DaveMethvin> any other thoughts?
[09:50:04] <mikesherov> yes, one more
[09:50:06] <DaveMethvin> gnarf mentioned a sweep of the bugs
[09:50:15] <DaveMethvin> ga mikesherov
[09:50:36] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10814
[09:50:55] <DaveMethvin> ah a kitchen sink ticket
[09:50:58] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:51:02] <mikesherov> so this was "make support tests run late as possible for closure compiler"
[09:51:56] <DaveMethvin> i think the idea was that if we do the work on first need it would be localized with the code that needs it
[09:52:16] <DaveMethvin> so for example if nobody called .position() then we wouldn't need the feature detects for position at all
[09:52:29] <DaveMethvin> right now we force them all to run on ready
[09:52:39] <DaveMethvin> but given that closure isn't our first prio
[09:52:58] <DaveMethvin> i would say the main thing here is to review to make sure that it works fast
[09:53:08] <DaveMethvin> even if we still run it (mostly) as a lump
[09:53:34] <mikesherov> I am reluctant to move them, as they add bytes
[09:53:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's why it's not as much of an issue if ccao isn't in master
[09:54:07] <DaveMethvin> but it is probably worth a look
[09:54:23] <DaveMethvin> both jaubourg and i had a crash in ie9 during support
[09:54:30] <DaveMethvin> that we couldn't figure out
[09:54:35] <DaveMethvin> it was strange
[09:54:44] <DaveMethvin> only happened on full test runs
[09:54:44] <timmywil> very
[09:54:48] <DaveMethvin> only on our own systems
[09:54:50] <DaveMethvin> not on the swarm
[09:54:59] <DaveMethvin> but the swarm doesnt' do a full test run i think
[09:55:07] <DaveMethvin> it runs each one separately
[09:55:21] <DaveMethvin> so that would explain the diff
[09:55:36] <DaveMethvin> anyway it had me worried
[09:55:45] <mikesherov> so can I move http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10814 out of 1.8?
[09:56:05] <DaveMethvin> are there any changes we'd want for 1.8?
[09:56:25] <DaveMethvin> maybe that can be closed in favor of specific-issue tix
[09:56:26] <mikesherov> not that I can see
[09:56:37] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10467
[09:56:39] <gnarf> -1 btw
[09:56:49] <gnarf> i can't use it in animate if we make it async
[09:57:15] <gnarf> perhaps make it an "option"
[09:57:25] <DaveMethvin> haha well you'll need to deathmatch with scott_gonzalez
[09:57:34] <DaveMethvin> oh god not an option
[09:58:16] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.deferredSettings.resolveAsync = "yes"  thereifixedit.com
[09:58:20] <gnarf> I don't mind if we make it async by default
[09:58:31] <gnarf> as long as I can still register functions for a sync call
[09:59:30] <DaveMethvin> so, should we do a separate get-together to triage the ticket list?
[09:59:51] <DaveMethvin> perhaps meet in jquery-dev during the evening this week?
[09:59:54] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10814 I going to close as wontfix for now in favor of specific tickets related to support laziness
[10:00:03] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: k
[10:00:40] <DaveMethvin> i think it would be worthwhile to run through the tickets and see if we can tackle/trash some of them
[10:00:58] <mikesherov> I'm in for that DaveMethvin
[10:01:10] <DaveMethvin> when is the best time for everyone? are evenings better?
[10:01:28] <DaveMethvin> how bout you gnarf?
[10:01:41] <gnarf> tomorrow is bad
[10:01:49] <gnarf> afternoons/eves are pretty open otherwise
[10:01:49] <mikesherov> Best for me is 12:30-1:30 EST or past 8:00
[10:02:07] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: can you make it?
[10:02:17] <gnarf> rwaldron: ?
[10:02:39] <DaveMethvin> 8pm some night this week would work for me
[10:02:50] <DaveMethvin> 12:30 as well if that is better for all
[10:02:54] <timmywil> yea, depends on which night
[10:03:04] <DaveMethvin> gnarf says tomorrow is bad
[10:03:11] <DaveMethvin> how about weds night 8pm?
[10:03:22] <mikesherov> Wednesday is the ONLY night that's bad for me
[10:03:25] <timmywil> that would have to be a maybe for me. I'm not sure yet
[10:03:29] <timmywil> ha
[10:03:33] <DaveMethvin> ok, thurs?
[10:03:45] <mikesherov> thursday works @8PM for me
