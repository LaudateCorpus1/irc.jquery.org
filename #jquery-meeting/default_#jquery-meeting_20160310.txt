[12:03:03] <bethge_> Hi there
[12:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/271 hasn't been merged yet.
[12:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Were you waiting on anything?
[12:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> Would you like me to merge it?
[12:07:50] <bethge_> Oh, sorry, wasn't sure if I should merge it. I will go ahead after the meeting
[12:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> Did you get a chance to continue your work on https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/274?
[12:10:09] <bethge_> Almost done on that. Want to make sure there are no blunders. I got to directly incorporate your commonAncestor function into the propagate function.
[12:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> great
[12:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> I started looking into https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/226/files#r50330083
[12:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to figure out why this is so different from the other files.
[12:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> But this test isn't even being run.
[12:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> Because 1) the test files wasn't uncommented in the list, 2) the .js file is prefixed with an underscore.
[12:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> Running the tests results in a failure.
[12:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm not sure we want to land this.
[12:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep digging into this after the meeting though.
[12:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> To clean up the test and either get it passing or figure out what's wrong in PEP.
[12:13:17] <bethge_> Sounds good. More test coverage! :)
[12:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have anything else to discuss today?
[12:15:30] <bethge_> Don't have anything more.
[12:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, I guess that's all for today.
[12:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:17:05] <bethge_> Thank you
[14:00:10] <arschmitz> agcolom: sfrisk: cgack: apsdehal1: meeting time
[14:00:13] <sfrisk> allo
[14:00:20] <cgack> howdy
[14:00:59] <cgack> cogwurx will likely not make it today, though he did push some updates to his PR
[14:01:04] <arschmitz> i know agcolom and gabriel wont make it today either
[14:01:11] <arschmitz> and i dont see jasper
[14:01:26] <apsdehal1> Hi
[14:01:33] <arschmitz> wow i think i summoned him lol
[14:01:37] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[14:02:19] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:02:30] <arschmitz> gabriel got the tests on selectmenu green yesterday
[14:02:32] <arschmitz> YAY!
[14:02:38] <cgack> nice!
[14:02:38] <arschmitz> so that should be just about ready to land
[14:02:43] <apsdehal1> great
[14:03:11] <arschmitz> cgack: i saw you pushed fix for toolbar
[14:03:18] <arschmitz> happen to have more luck then me with table?
[14:03:26] <cgack> yeah in the panel demos
[14:03:43] <cgack> nothing on table, i toyed around with some guesses, but they led nowhere
[14:04:15] <cgack> without them failing locally, its very difficult to pinpoint
[14:04:55] <arschmitz> yup
[14:05:17] <arschmitz> much of the time i had set aside for this also got taken by other issues ill get to in a minute
[14:05:18] <cgack> the only thing that seems to be a trend is when the tests are using the table prototype to call private methods, it sometimes fails on travis
[14:05:52] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: did you make any progress on demo tests failing?
[14:06:03] <cgack> but not locally. not sure if we just QUnit.skip those for now, and rework them later, or what
[14:06:24] <arschmitz> cgack: im going to put a little more time in but we may end up skipping for now
[14:06:35] <apsdehal1> arschmitz: Didn't get time this week, have been busy with final year project. But will update surely before next week's thursday.
[14:07:01] <apsdehal1> Oh, it is Wednesday for you :)
[14:07:02] <cgack> arschmitz: okay great. let me know if I can help out
[14:07:42] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: no problem thank you
[14:07:53] <arschmitz> so this brings me to next issue
[14:07:58] <arschmitz> which is api.jquerymobile.com
[14:08:24] <arschmitz> its been unable to deploy it turns out since grunt-wordpress was updated back in december
[14:08:43] <arschmitz> i THiNK i know in a general sense whats wrong now
[14:08:58] <arschmitz> but not sure yet i think its bad xml
[14:09:17] <arschmitz> because the only change of any signifigance that went with this was an update to xmlrpc
[14:09:36] <arschmitz> core is having same issue
[14:09:54] <arschmitz> and its happening on a specific page when it validates so this would seem to confirm
[14:10:09] <arschmitz> so this is a blocker for 1.5-beta
[14:10:47] <arschmitz> also supporting my idea of bad xml is jqueryui.com works fine
[14:10:55] <arschmitz> api.jqueryui.com i mean
[14:11:03] <arschmitz> which is nearly identical to mobile api
[14:13:52] <arschmitz> ok jasperdegroot any updates?
[14:14:12] <jasperdegroot> not really, sorry
[14:14:29] <jasperdegroot> I just reviewed cogwurx his PR
[14:14:58] <jasperdegroot> but didn't have any time this week to fix any of the other demos issues
[14:16:01] <arschmitz> ok
[14:16:16] <arschmitz> well thats all i have this week
[14:16:32] <arschmitz> well kinda take that back
[14:16:34] <arschmitz> RTL!
[14:16:52] <arschmitz> is happening in UI well already happened in many widgets
[14:17:33] <arschmitz> so part of my reasoning in the change in icons was to do with rtl
[14:17:43] <arschmitz> if they are inline the position is adjusted automaticly
[14:17:57] <arschmitz> we had some one start testing and in ui
[14:18:11] <arschmitz> and most of the widgets no require no special handling at all for normal rtl
[14:18:35] <arschmitz> and bidi support is trivial
[14:19:04] <arschmitz> mostly adding the direction to any remote generate content like popups which are added to body
[14:19:48] <jasperdegroot> not bad
[14:20:30] <arschmitz> this should naturally translate to mobile
[14:20:37] <arschmitz> since we now match in most places
[14:20:56] <jasperdegroot> table might need some extra care
[14:21:20] <arschmitz> sure some widgets in ui do too
[14:21:35] <arschmitz> but in general we now support rtl pretty well and the rest is being worked on now
[14:23:18] <jasperdegroot> does a thing like a back button also have to be moved to other side of the header with RTL?
[14:23:51] <jasperdegroot> or is it only about text?
[14:24:06] <arschmitz> thats kinda a matter of oppinion
[14:24:18] <arschmitz> and some things are never mirrored
[14:24:22] <arschmitz> like directional things
[14:24:37] <arschmitz> play ff rewind icons things like that
[14:24:40] <arschmitz> are never mirrored
[14:24:47] <arschmitz> you can follow discussions here
[14:24:53] <jasperdegroot> next and previous buttons?
[14:24:53] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1682/
[14:24:58] <arschmitz> not mirrored
[14:25:01] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:25:19] <arschmitz> they dont change the idea of forward back direction in rtl
[14:25:33] <arschmitz> its an old throw back from VCR's lol
[14:25:35] <jasperdegroot> I see
[14:27:09] <cgack> I still have a VCR
[14:27:11] <cgack> :)
[14:27:35] <jasperdegroot> we also have to check CSS if we still use -99999px somewhere to move content from the screen
[14:28:05] <jasperdegroot> if we need to use it, left should become right, but of course better to not use it all
[14:28:34] <jasperdegroot> don't remember if we still have this somewhere in our CSS
[14:28:50] <arschmitz> i know we did in button
[14:28:53] <arschmitz> but it was removed
[14:29:08] <arschmitz> i know we also had it to do with the hidden accessible class
[14:29:28] <arschmitz> but i think that was update to use one which matches ui and does not do that but would have ot check to be sure
[14:30:17] <arschmitz> once  ui finishes
[14:30:26] <arschmitz> we can pull in the Ui change and go through mobile
[14:30:53] <jasperdegroot> it's still in button on 1.5-dev
[14:31:00] <jasperdegroot> text-indent: -99999px
[14:31:29] <jasperdegroot> just did a search... that's the only place where I found it
[14:31:51] <arschmitz> ok at some point we will need to update that
[14:32:34] <arschmitz> but lets let it get settled in ui first
[14:32:43] <jasperdegroot> yup
[14:35:38] <arschmitz> ok thats all i have this week
[20:35:58] <spring2> hi i need help about learning queueing for 2 different div id loading on document .ready
[20:35:58] <spring2> anyone want to help me plz  thx
