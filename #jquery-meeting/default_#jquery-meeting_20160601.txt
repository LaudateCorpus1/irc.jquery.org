[12:01:18] <arschmitz> hi
[12:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> So, let's start with checkboxradio.
[12:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14955
[12:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz sent a PR to fix this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1712/
[12:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> That PR looks good to me.
[12:05:33] <arschmitz> yeah rather then css trickery or specificity i just made a new class
[12:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> much saner
[12:05:51] <arschmitz> yup
[12:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> That brings us to controlgroup.
[12:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> Alex merged the PR to fix a bunch of issues.
[12:06:48] <fnagel> hey
[12:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> Which just left https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14972
[12:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Controlgroup with only one element does not get correct rounded corners
[12:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> And there's now a PR for that as well: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1711
[12:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need some time to review that.
[12:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> But those two PRs will close out the last issues for 1.12.0
[12:07:26] <arschmitz> little more complicated then other
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:07:39] <arschmitz> but basicly i added a 4th "position"
[12:07:47] <arschmitz> only in addition to beginning middle and end
[12:08:03] <arschmitz> or first last and middle rather
[12:08:21] <arschmitz> in the class generator function
[12:09:06] <arschmitz> oh that probably requires a docs change
[12:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> DOCS DOCS DOCS
[12:10:04] <arschmitz> oh guess we didnt document the extension process
[12:10:10] <arschmitz> so we need to do that
[12:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> whoops
[12:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/new
[12:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> Can you file an issue and set the milestone to 1.12?
[12:11:05] <arschmitz> lol yup
[12:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> Someone sent a PR to optimize all the images in jquery-ui: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1710
[12:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> In the past, we've always asked people to not touch theme images.
[12:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> Because of alpha channel problems.
[12:12:08] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/302
[12:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> But I think this is safe to do now since I think that was limited to IE 6.
[12:12:38] <arschmitz> good ol ie6
[12:13:01] <arschmitz> not sad to see that be way in the past
[12:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> Thought on one more RC before final?
[12:14:43] <arschmitz> i think so
[12:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> Or should we go straight to final?
[12:14:45] <arschmitz> lots of changes
[12:15:03] <arschmitz> i mean we can always patch
[12:15:34] <arschmitz> but another rc seems better
[12:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'd actually like to do another RC and try to get TestSwarm greener.
[12:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> Would also let us land the image optimization PR, get it out in an RC, and see if anyone runs into problems.
[12:16:15] <arschmitz> +1
[12:18:16] <jzaefferer> sounds good
[12:18:59] <jzaefferer> with yearly releases, people seem to be more likely to test RC releases
[12:20:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: about download builder..
[12:20:22] <jzaefferer> since you said you'd work on DB after 1.12 is done, maybe first task could be migrating to node 4+?
[12:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:21:06] <fnagel> Not really to discuss but I hoped to get some more feedback on my calendar PR
[12:21:11] <fnagel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1698
[12:21:20] <fnagel> So, just a "gentle reminder" ;-)
[12:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:22:16] <jzaefferer> Your last comment there is "Thanks for your feedback! I will implement this soon." - that didn't sound like you were looking for more feedback /o\
[12:22:30] <jzaefferer> Not that I looked until now :/
[12:22:53] <fnagel> Oh yes, that was about the next PR :-D
[12:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well fnagel's comment was about one specific question he asked.
[12:23:51] <jzaefferer> Alright, I'll try to help. Currently my time goes into mentoring 2 GSoC students...
[12:24:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you don't want to discuss DB?
[12:24:40] <jzaefferer> btw. I'm still not sure what to say here: https://github.com/jzaefferer/webpack-jquery-ui/issues/1
[12:24:46] <jzaefferer> themes on npm?
[12:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> Are there things to discuss about DB right now?
[12:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> My "sure" was in response to migrating to node 4+ as the first task.
[12:25:19] <scott_gonzalez> Are there specific things we should discuss now?
[12:25:23] <jzaefferer> oh, I missed that, with Felix' comments inbetween, nevermind
[12:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure there will be plenty to discuss once I start digging into it.
[12:25:40] <jzaefferer> right
[12:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> re: themes on npm
[12:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> My view is still that people shouldn't be using them.
[12:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> They should build themes that match their site.
[12:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm -0 on themes on npm.
[12:33:09] <scott_gonzalez> Anybody else want to chime in?
[12:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:36:43] <jzaefferer> Well, I closed the issue: https://github.com/jzaefferer/webpack-jquery-ui/issues/1
[12:36:54] <jzaefferer> pointed out they could install from https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/tree/master/cdn/ui/1.12.0-rc.2/themes
[12:37:05] <jzaefferer> and that they shouldn't...
[12:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> That looks good.
[12:38:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[12:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
