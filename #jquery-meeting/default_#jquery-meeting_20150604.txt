[09:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz M4rius snover
[09:02:09] <snover> i exist.
[09:02:56] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> I landed the pointermap update: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/190
[09:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard anything from Stuart about the dispatcher updates he was working on.
[09:04:49] <scott_gonzalez> And we *still* haven't had a PEWG call.
[09:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why this week's call didn't happen.
[09:05:22] <jrossi3> Yeah we need to get a call on the schedule
[09:05:46] <jrossi3> Idk either
[09:06:19] <jrossi3> Google landed the pointer event tests into blink, which is a good sign
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged Rick to find out if they use web driver for any of their tests, but I didn't hear back.
[09:06:52] <snover> i saw moz tried to land and then backed out PE in nightlies
[09:06:56] <jrossi3> I anticipate a resurgence of issues/calls once they start writing the implementation
[09:07:06] <snover> without a flag
[09:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> To find out if they could leverage any of the work we're going to do for automating the W3C tests.
[09:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of which...
[09:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi3: Didn't you say we can get an actual intern to do that work for us?
[09:08:37] <jrossi3> Hmm, we just had some start
[09:08:53] <jrossi3> Not sure if they have projects yet, but I'll check
[09:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:10] <jrossi3> Besides test automation, is there other work you could use help with?
[09:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> Going through the existing failures and seeing if the failures are from bad tests or bad code.
[09:12:29] <jrossi3> Sure though I'd consider that part of thr testing job ðŸ˜‰
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> I meant the unit tests that are failing.
[09:13:03] <jrossi3> Gotcha
[09:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius are you fully blocked on a response from the WG for the capturing stuff?
[09:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> I guess he's not around.
[09:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> There are two open PRs. Is anyone able to commit to reviewing one or both?
[09:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/pep/pulls
[09:23:36] * jrossi1 's connection dropped
[09:24:09] <jrossi1> I can look at #168
[09:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks
[09:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it for today.
[09:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[11:02:48] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: gabriel_schulhof: cgack sfrisk: agcolom: arthurvr meeting time
[11:03:00] <cgack> howdy
[11:03:04] <jasperdegroot> hello all
[11:03:12] <arschmitz> apsdehal
[11:03:32] <sfrisk> hey
[11:05:16] <apsdehal_> Hi
[11:05:27] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[11:05:36] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=2139473452
[11:06:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:06:49] <arschmitz> so lets go over PR status
[11:07:35] <arschmitz> we have 15 open PR's that represent the bulk of the work left for 1.5
[11:08:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the vast majority of these are yours
[11:08:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. Sorry! I'll get on them.
[11:09:17] <arschmitz> 11 of 15 are waiting on updates
[11:09:58] <arschmitz> do we have anything major that does not have an open PR for it yet?
[11:10:47] <jasperdegroot> what about selectmenu?
[11:10:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Ummm ... the two major ones that, although they may have PRs, will be quite a doozy, are table and panel.
[11:11:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[11:11:17] <cgack> slider i think needs a PR
[11:11:19] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i thought there was one for that maybe it has not been reopened?
[11:11:30] <arschmitz> cgack: you had one for that though didnt you it just needed to be updated?
[11:11:39] <arschmitz> or am i crazy?
[11:11:55] <cgack> yeah, I had one before the classes api change. I think i closed that one and just need a new one based off of 1.5-dev
[11:12:02] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:12:17] <arschmitz> and i thought gabriel_schulhof had done the same with selectmenu
[11:12:19] <cgack> i'm working on that now before heading back into toolbar land
[11:12:30] <arschmitz> cgack: sounds good
[11:13:00] <jasperdegroot> yeah, i see a branch for selectmenu, just no PR
[11:13:06] <arschmitz> ok
[11:13:25] <arschmitz> those should be simplish to update
[11:13:33] <arschmitz> now that everything is stabel ish lol
[11:14:09] <arschmitz> we are getting close to a beta so want to keep on top of priorities leading up to that
[11:14:21] <arschmitz> well alpha more likely but any way :-)
[11:14:23] <agcolom> hi, sorry for the delay!
[11:14:28] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem
[11:15:36] <arschmitz> lets make sure we have open issues for any 1.5 blockers
[11:15:44] <jasperdegroot> do those PRs include updates for demos?
[11:15:59] <arschmitz> yes all classes prs are including demo updates
[11:16:09] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:16:10] <arschmitz> before they land anyway
[11:16:15] <jasperdegroot> cool
[11:16:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: your great with issues do you want to try to make sure we have open issues marked blocker for anything remaining for 1.5?
[11:16:58] <jasperdegroot> sure
[11:17:14] <arschmitz> we can go over them next week in the meeting and try to make sure we have everything and assign them
[11:17:38] <jasperdegroot> there are 103 open tickets with milestone 1.5
[11:17:48] <jasperdegroot> just have to see what has been fixed in 1.5-dev
[11:17:51] <arschmitz> yeah im sure we wont be getting to them all like always
[11:18:02] <arschmitz> but yes also im sure many are actually fixed already
[11:18:06] <jasperdegroot> i am afraid not all commits ref to an issue
[11:18:18] <arschmitz> well anything in 1.5 does not auto close either
[11:18:23] <arschmitz> they only autoclose on master
[11:18:27] <jasperdegroot> of course
[11:18:35] <agcolom> in the notes, do you still need auto-update to the status of 1.5?
[11:18:48] <agcolom> auto init sorry!
[11:18:57] <arschmitz> yes
[11:18:57] <jasperdegroot> but you will see the reference in the ticket
[11:19:08] <arschmitz> thats not complete yet there is a version on master but we decided on changes
[11:19:12] <arschmitz> yes
[11:20:24] <agcolom> arschmitz: I'm counting 14PRs
[11:20:33] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulls
[11:20:48] <arschmitz> oh gabriel_schulhof landed one since the meeting started lol
[11:20:57] <agcolom> ;-)
[11:21:27] <jasperdegroot> by the end of the meeting 0 PRs :D
[11:21:40] <arschmitz> lol
[11:21:50] <arschmitz> ok so lets talk about tests
[11:22:01] <arschmitz> he have not been green in a while
[11:22:22] <arschmitz> core has broken us over and over lol
[11:22:30] <arschmitz> but the offset changes are being reverted
[11:22:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, but unfortunately, I forgot to correct all the carats :(
[11:23:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: heh you should see what the rebase of 1.5 to master looks like right now
[11:23:10] <arschmitz> its not good
[11:23:19] <arschmitz> we made to many chanfes on master
[11:23:41] <arschmitz> i should have landed all those master pr's on 1.5-dev
[11:24:01] <arschmitz> anyway
[11:24:13] <arschmitz> so the newest core breakage with the indexof url
[11:24:23] <arschmitz> is because we were using the deprecated .load event alias
[11:24:26] <arschmitz> which was removed
[11:24:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Aha! OK.
[11:24:44] <arschmitz> so it was trying to ajax a function
[11:24:57] <arschmitz> which does not really work
[11:25:05] <arschmitz> thats already fixed on 1.5-dev
[11:25:21] <arschmitz> the spider breakages
[11:25:37] <arschmitz> were due to fieldcontain.js still being in index.php
[11:25:44] <arschmitz> which causes no issues with normal logging
[11:25:57] <arschmitz> but grunt php does extra verbose warning logging
[11:26:08] <arschmitz> and there was a php warning in the middle of the combined file
[11:26:15] <arschmitz> which of course causes a syntax error
[11:26:37] <arschmitz> thats also already fixed on 1.5-dev
[11:27:23] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8135 plus the offset changes being reverted will get us back to green
[11:28:04] <cgack> well, maybe not rangeslider
[11:28:58] <arschmitz> cgack: yeah that too
[11:29:00] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:29:09] <arschmitz> so speaking of
[11:29:18] <arschmitz> I did find a break in our theme extension
[11:29:24] <arschmitz> reviewing rangeslider
[11:29:35] <arschmitz> we were counting on all the classes props to exist
[11:29:49] <arschmitz> and they dont in the final implementation unless they have a corresponding key
[11:29:56] <arschmitz> value i mean
[11:30:22] <arschmitz> so it was not applying anything in those cases
[11:30:27] <gabriel_schulhof> How do you mean we're counting on them to exist?
[11:30:45] <arschmitz> it was checking this.options.classes[ prop ]
[11:30:53] <arschmitz> and making sure it was defined before setting it
[11:30:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Ooooh! Yeah, that's no gouda!
[11:31:10] <arschmitz> it was correct when it was written
[11:31:15] <arschmitz> but the implementation changed
[11:31:35] <arschmitz> so thats included in the widget-extensions PR now too
[11:33:17] <arschmitz> i think thats the issue that jasperdegroot mentioned in dev with corners
[11:33:54] <arschmitz> controlgroup has no classes props at al
[11:34:11] <arschmitz> so the old option setting would not work
[11:37:51] <arschmitz> ok accordion
[11:38:05] <arschmitz> sfrisk: any update thats a 1.5 blocker with no PR come to think of it
[11:38:36] <sfrisk> I'll submit the PR tonight
[11:38:46] <arschmitz> awesome thanks
[11:39:52] <arschmitz> ok does any one have anything else to discuss?
[11:40:08] <jasperdegroot> not really
[11:40:36] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm good ...
[11:40:50] <arschmitz> ok thank you everyone
[11:41:01] <arschmitz> and thank you for helping to continue to get the PR count down
[11:41:02] <jasperdegroot> later all
[11:41:10] <arschmitz> everyone landed at least one open PR this week
[11:41:52] <jasperdegroot> awesome
[11:41:59] <arschmitz> lets see if we can do it again
[11:42:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: isnt your event prevent default one ready to land too?
[11:43:03] <arschmitz> i dont see the read to merge label but i think i gave it the :+1:
[11:44:50] <arschmitz> anyway see everyone back on -dev
