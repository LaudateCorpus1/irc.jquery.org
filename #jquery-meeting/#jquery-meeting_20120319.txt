[08:56:18] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:00:09] <DaveMethvin> hey everybody!
[09:00:27] <gibson042> hello
[09:00:40] <addyosmani> Hey all!
[09:00:51] <DaveMethvin> i'm out on the west coast, actually taking a couple of days off but since I missed last week and will miss next week i figured i should show up today. :)
[09:01:16] <DaveMethvin> addyosmani: thanks for keeping an eye on the docs issues
[09:01:32] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:01:37] <DaveMethvin> anybody else around?
[09:02:03] * kborchers is lurking DaveMethvin
[09:02:07] <addyosmani> Not at all, DaveMethvin
[09:02:15] <DaveMethvin> i can only stay about 20 more minutes so if anyone has anything let me know and we can add to the agenda for a lightning round
[09:02:20] <DaveMethvin> hey kborchers
[09:02:25] <kborchers> o/
[09:02:33] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, addyosmani: which docs issues in particular?
[09:02:44] <kswedberg> anything I should know about?
[09:03:01] <DaveMethvin> changing the ajax docs to use .done instead of .complete
[09:03:13] <DaveMethvin> er, .success
[09:03:19] <DaveMethvin> since we're deprecating those
[09:03:32] <addyosmani> kswedberg mainly outstanding updates to ajax examples to shift away from success/error
[09:03:36] <kswedberg> ah. cool. yeah, that's great. weird that I didn't get the auto-email about that.
[09:03:43] <DaveMethvin> tryna encourage ppl to use the standard promise methods
[09:03:47] <DaveMethvin> which is good
[09:03:48] <kswedberg> right on
[09:03:55] <DaveMethvin> maybe it will soak in by osmosis
[09:04:06] <DaveMethvin> not to be confused with osmani
[09:04:14] <kswedberg> zing!
[09:04:19] <addyosmani> :p
[09:04:20] <DaveMethvin> i gotta tellya
[09:04:23] <kswedberg> rimshot
[09:04:35] <DaveMethvin> so the biggest issue lately has been trac
[09:04:43] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: are you around?
[09:04:54] <addyosmani> Ugh. The trac spam
[09:05:04] <DaveMethvin> we have to figure out some way to stop the spam and get email notif back
[09:05:34] <DaveMethvin> it's that jaudorg and gidson042 thang
[09:05:37] <danheberden> DaveMethvin yes, sry
[09:05:42] <DaveMethvin> np dan
[09:05:47] <danheberden> so we have two problems re: spam
[09:05:58] <danheberden> i had to lower settings to let the damn ip filter spam thingy work
[09:06:13] <danheberden> and had to lower the karma threshold
[09:06:34] <DaveMethvin> are there other things we can do, like banning html and making the links nofollow?
[09:07:08] <danheberden> we can, i'm sure - honestly, the biggest problem is i don't know python, trac seems organized as well as a two yearolds closet, and everything is just "wtf" when i look at it
[09:07:14] <danheberden> so if there are any trac experts anyone knows
[09:07:37] <danheberden> or if mikesherov can keep looking at stuff
[09:07:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm no python expert either, i hoped i could use my patented copy/pasta method
[09:08:09] <danheberden> i'll raise the karma level back
[09:08:19] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at the code, i got close once just before snover volunteered to fix things
[09:08:23] <danheberden> that should help a bit and i'll look into the allowed settings
[09:08:59] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov said he had played with trac, can you get him access danheberden?
[09:09:09] <DaveMethvin> if so we just need to sweet talk him into fixing it
[09:09:11] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:09:17] <danheberden> DaveMethvin he has full access to the box
[09:09:21] <danheberden> he fixed some more query problems too
[09:09:24] <danheberden> also http://danheberden.com/share/c55641.png
[09:09:30] <danheberden> this might help - i'll tweak with it
[09:09:38] <rwaldron> Hi!
[09:09:40] <rwaldron> sorry I'm late.
[09:09:51] <DaveMethvin> np rwaldron
[09:10:01] <danheberden> we ask for fiddles
[09:10:08] <danheberden> and that actually hurts the karma
[09:10:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wonder if we could create a form field for that link to isolate it
[09:10:35] <DaveMethvin> one that had to point to jsfiddle or jsbin
[09:10:41] <rwaldron> (which part of the meeting notes are we on?)
[09:10:44] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure it's doable as a plugin
[09:10:44] <rwaldron> Trac?
[09:10:48] <DaveMethvin> still on the spam part yeah
[09:10:53] <rwaldron> ok
[09:10:54] <danheberden> heh, it'd be the same as allowing a link re: karma points tohugh
[09:11:13] <danheberden> there's also some regex we can run on the body
[09:11:21] <danheberden> and degrade points if it matches
[09:12:05] <DaveMethvin> so i only have about 10 more minutes before i have to leave,
[09:12:15] <DaveMethvin> looks like we're ready for 1.7.2 unless there are killer tickets
[09:12:27] <DaveMethvin> i'd like this to be the last release before 1.8, which will be two or three months
[09:12:39] <rwaldron> Sounds good to me
[09:12:44] <DaveMethvin> so if there are things that can't wait we should think about doing those before 1.7.2 is out
[09:12:55] <rwaldron> barring some sort of awful regression ;)
[09:13:05] <DaveMethvin> otherwise i'll assume weds is okay and shoot for then
[09:13:15] <rwaldron> +1
[09:14:02] <addyosmani> +1
[09:14:09] <DaveMethvin> triage ... since we're supposed to land 1.8 stuff soon, i guess we could wait on the triage and do it mid to late april?
[09:14:25] <DaveMethvin> all the fixes are going into 1.8 at that point anyway
[09:14:37] <DaveMethvin> i haven't seen anything too critical come in lately
[09:14:56] <DaveMethvin> but of course i've had to scan the recent list, we don't have emails
[09:15:29] <rwaldron> grunt is pretty much ready to rock
[09:15:34] <rwaldron> from a functional POV
[09:15:39] <DaveMethvin> so on the deprecated list, what was discussed last week? any thoughts on how to proceed?
[09:15:44] <rwaldron> just need to rewrite the release tasks, but that can wait
[09:15:45] <DaveMethvin> mainly we need to let people know
[09:15:49] <DaveMethvin> asap
[09:16:03] <rwaldron> I'd like to get everyone using grunt during 1.8 for feedback
[09:16:25] <DaveMethvin> agreed, that will make us all experience its joy or pain
[09:16:33] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin "Defer voting on deprecation/removal to dev days"
[09:16:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, if it's just voting how about we do it sooner?
[09:17:00] <DaveMethvin> or are there issues to discuss on some?
[09:17:03] <rwaldron> I think it's not just voting
[09:17:15] <rwaldron> I'm not sure, I can't speak for everyone else
[09:17:51] <DaveMethvin> i'll start an email thread to see if we can find a time for core dev days then
[09:17:57] <DaveMethvin> and we can discuss it then
[09:18:26] <rwaldron> +1
[09:18:50] <DaveMethvin> on mobile browsers, has anyone tried them on browserstack?
[09:18:56] <rwaldron> I have not
[09:19:03] <DaveMethvin> i
[09:19:05] <DaveMethvin> w
[09:19:10] <rwaldron> I only learned of that feature this AM
[09:19:10] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[09:19:21] <rwaldron> I was writing arduino code all last week
[09:19:29] <DaveMethvin> let's discuss and see if we should add to our list on dev days
[09:19:36] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[09:19:40] <addyosmani> I've tried it initially. JÃ¶rn has more experience with it though.
[09:19:56] <rwaldron> TBH, I'm not thrilled about core suddenly incurring the burden of running tests on mobile platforms
[09:20:17] <DaveMethvin> ok i have to go, but we can continue some of these topics online ... or you can talk amongst  yourselves :P
[09:20:24] <DaveMethvin> cyl guys, thanks!
[09:20:31] <rwaldron> I think I'm all set
[09:20:32] <rwaldron> later!
[09:20:54] <addyosmani> Later!
