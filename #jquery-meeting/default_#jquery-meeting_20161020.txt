[12:00:33] <arschmitz> hey
[12:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I know neither of us have done anything because we've both been slammed at work.
[12:02:01] <arschmitz> yup
[12:05:01] <bethge> Hi
[12:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:05:12] <bethge> sorry, same here. Didn't get to do much.
[12:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we don't have much to discuss today.
[12:05:33] <arschmitz> does not seem that way
[12:05:37] <bethge> Yeah afraid so :(
[12:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> I would really like to push through all the tests and get us to at least have everything automated, even if we're not passing.
[12:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping to have some time before the next meeting. Maybe we can all try to get a PR in for at least one test?
[12:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> That should be small enough that we're able to accomplish it.
[12:07:06] <bethge> Yeah, sounds good!
[12:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> Only one of my kids has activities tonight, so I *should* have time to look into the problem with pulling in newer W3C tests (https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/314)
[12:09:00] <bethge> Ok nice. Will look into setting the touch-action property on the elements for touch input.
[12:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[12:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
