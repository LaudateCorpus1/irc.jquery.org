[14:01:06] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time
[14:01:16] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, arschmitz, kristyjy, nashvail
[14:01:22] <arschmitz> hi
[14:03:08] <sfrisk> okay so while I grab the agenda link
[14:03:19] <sfrisk> it's important to note that we have the normalize stuff done from geekman-rohit
[14:03:24] <sfrisk> and kristyjy finished up the work on tables
[14:03:31] <kristyjy> woot
[14:04:11] <sfrisk> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:05:58] <sfrisk> normalize pr is here: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/169
[14:06:18] <geekman-rohit> hey everyone
[14:06:23] <sfrisk> and the tables PR is here: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/151
[14:06:49] <sfrisk> from what I saw, normalize looked good to me
[14:07:00] <sfrisk> so if everyone agrees, I'll pull that in after this meeting
[14:07:30] <sfrisk> kristyy reworked tables to take into account discussions from the review
[14:07:34] <sfrisk> including use of variables
[14:08:39] <kristyjy> I reviewed normalize looks good to me
[14:08:44] <sfrisk> okay
[14:08:56] <sfrisk> I'm not sure if what you did will get affected at all my normalize's inclusion
[14:09:08] <sfrisk> by* normalize's*
[14:09:17] <sfrisk> although I suspect changes will be minimal
[14:09:24] <kristyjy> sounds good
[14:09:58] <sfrisk> Okay
[14:10:00] <geekman-rohit> Sarah remember the css conf talk about using ems
[14:10:10] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:10:20] <geekman-rohit> I always thought our em function was weird
[14:10:26] <sfrisk> that was osmething I want to discuss after this
[14:10:35] <sfrisk> because this pr is not necessarily the place to change thing
[14:10:40] <sfrisk> tables pr
[14:10:44] <sfrisk> on em/px/etc
[14:12:18] <geekman-rohit> ohkay i meant in general
[14:12:24] <kristyjy> I agree I think doing an overall rework of handing using ems instead of pixels for all of the existing components could be one PR
[14:12:35] <geekman-rohit> it affects all PRs
[14:13:27] <geekman-rohit> it's also something that will need some discussion/debate
[14:15:13] <geekman-rohit> @sfrisk we can discuss later.  I was only voicing it before i forgot all about it later
[14:16:57] <sfrisk> but I want to create a ticket that addresses it
[14:17:29] <geekman-rohit> +1 for that
[14:17:41] <sfrisk> I would prefer rem for font-size, px for border-width, and em for almost everything else
[14:17:47] <geekman-rohit> I can already imagine the long debate it might start
[14:18:14] <sfrisk> haha, yeah
[14:18:51] <geekman-rohit> basically rem for font size is what we are doing indirectly via that em function
[14:19:26] <geekman-rohit> defining things in terms of em to a fixed px value of 16. shouldnt be that hard to translate that to rem
[14:20:02] <sfrisk> yeah, there is a mixin that I use that makes rems REALLY easy
[14:20:54] <sfrisk> honestly incorporating this on the base level would be cool: https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/
[14:21:54] <geekman-rohit> did we agree on not supporting ie9?
[14:22:14] <geekman-rohit> we had a discussion sometime about that I don't remember what we decided kn
[14:22:18] <geekman-rohit> on*
[14:26:18] <sfrisk> we could always do a fallback for ie9 if we have to
[14:27:35] <geekman-rohit> but I think this affects everything.. I don't really like the idea of a fallback for how we look at and think about sizing
[14:27:49] <arschmitz> why are we trying to support ie9
[14:27:55] <arschmitz> i thought we dropped that a long time ago
[14:27:58] <kristyjy> yeah I definitely think we should try to use the advice in that talk with using REMs as the parent size and then ems for it's children
[14:28:17] <kristyjy> we could even convert the rems to px with a mixin for ie9
[14:28:29] <geekman-rohit> if arschmitz is right then problem solved
[14:28:31] <arschmitz> ie9 is not even supported by microsoft anymore
[14:28:35] <kristyjy> sounds good to me
[14:29:39] <sfrisk> okay drop all the bad things!
[14:29:40] <sfrisk> weee
[14:30:01] <kristyjy> If that's the case we won't need a fallback for flexbox either
[14:30:18] <arschmitz> considdering we are still not that close to a v1
[14:30:22] <sfrisk> true
[14:30:23] <arschmitz> i wouldnt even bother with 10
[14:30:31] <kristyjy> lol fair enough
[14:30:31] <sfrisk> okay forward thinking css framework
[14:30:32] <arschmitz> just 11 and edge
[14:30:44] <arschmitz> thats all microsoft recomends supporting
[14:30:48] <sfrisk> I couldn't remember if jquery's stand on browsers had changed or not
[14:30:50] <arschmitz> thats all mobile and ui support
[14:30:52] <sfrisk> but 11 and edge isn't that bad
[14:30:59] <kristyjy> nice
[14:31:00] <sfrisk> and if we do flexbox, that make rtl support SOOOO much easier
[14:31:07] <kristyjy> :)
[14:31:26] <sfrisk> although probably not focus on grid right now
[14:31:33] <sfrisk> okay, so I'll merge in normalize
[14:31:40] <sfrisk> review tables for kristy?
[14:32:16] <sfrisk> and I'll create a ticket for standardization in units
[14:33:15] <geekman-rohit> I remember slayslot requesting to work on tables
[14:33:48] <kristyjy> if he wants to take over any edits from here he can feel free.
[14:34:20] <kristyjy> I'm not that attached to tables :)
[14:34:26] <sfrisk> i might write a ticket to revamp the typography
[14:34:31] <sfrisk> and do that this week
[14:34:31] <geekman-rohit> I like my tables
[14:34:40] <geekman-rohit> sounds good sfrisk
[14:35:23] <geekman-rohit> and once kristyjys pr is in.. i would like to work on tables too
[14:37:43] <sfrisk> I also want to see how http://view.css-chassis.com/input-styling/demos/inputs.html looks with buttons
[14:39:24] <sfrisk> okay I don't know if we have anything else to talk about today
[14:39:44] <sfrisk> I'll pull in normalize, create those tickets
[14:43:10] <sfrisk> see everyone later
