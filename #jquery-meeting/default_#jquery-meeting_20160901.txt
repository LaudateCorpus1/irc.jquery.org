[12:03:55] <bethge> Hi
[12:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> I looked over your PR. It looks good, but I'd like to spend more time thinking through the changes and what you've documented.
[12:05:17] <arschmitz> Hi
[12:06:46] <bethge> scott_gonzalez: Yeah I agree, there can easily unexpected side effects
[12:06:59] <bethge> *be
[12:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> In other news, I'm hoping to get jQuery UI 1.12.1 out next week, so that will make me available for PEP work :-)
[12:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, speaking of releases...
[12:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> We haven't done a PEP release in a while.
[12:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> And someone asked for one.
[12:10:14] <arschmitz> Yeah we should
[12:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should do that once the passive events listener PR gets merged?
[12:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> The other option is that we just do a release now.
[12:12:11] <arschmitz> Passive sounds good
[12:12:59] <bethge> hopefully rbyers can shed some light on the issue, then we know how good/bad the current approach si
[12:14:38] <bethge> I guess we also need think if it is ok to have different behaviour of native touch-action vs current approach
[12:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> I was wondering why that changes.
[12:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Are we doing something wrong?
[12:16:32] <bethge> I believe we are currently not checking if any ancestor element has a more restrictive touch-action property.
[12:17:50] <bethge> If you open this one in Chrome with Mobile emulation: http://bethge.github.io/touch-action/pep-touch-action.html
[12:19:16] <bethge> In PEP dragging the green box causes dragging, because it is auto, but with native touch-action support, there would be no dragging, because of the parent that has touch-action: none
[12:21:03] <bethge> I might be understanding something about touch-action wrong
[12:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> "When a user touches an element, the effect of that touch is determined by the value of the touch-action property and the default touch behaviors on the element and its ancestors. A touch behavior is supported if allowed by the touch-action properties of all elements between the hit tested element and it's nearest ancestor with the default touch behavior (including both the hit tested element and the element
[12:23:27] <scott_gonzalez>  with the default touch behavior)."
[12:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> Not the clearest wording.
[12:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm really not sure what's supposed to happen in this case.
[12:25:24] <bethge> arschmitz: didn't you polyfill this in hammer.js?
[12:27:40] <arschmitz> Yes
[12:27:47] <arschmitz> We walk up the tree
[12:28:35] <arschmitz> I sent a link to it at some point hard to get this second I'm on phone at bank
[12:28:51] <arschmitz> Look at hammer-time not hammer.js
[12:30:27] <bethge> Ah, right, it was hammertime
[12:31:41] <bethge> gotcha: https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer-time/blob/master/hammer-time.js#L138-L147
[12:33:59] <bethge> So, I would assume PEP kinda needs behaviour, before supporting native touch-action
[12:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> But that stops as soon as it finds a value.
[12:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what PEP is doing, right?
[12:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like Chrome isn't doing that.
[12:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe it's taking the combination of all ancestor values?
[12:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's wait for Rick to chime in.
[12:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see about getting the wording cleaned up a bit in the spec as well.
[12:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, actually re-reading the spec I realize I misread the first time.
[12:36:54] <scott_gonzalez> I read "default touch behaviors" as "default touch-action behaviors"
[12:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> And thought it was saying that it was finding multiple elements' values to use.
[12:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> But maybe this does need some clarification.
[12:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> Because "default touch behaviors of the element and its ancestors" might be interpreted differently.
[12:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> I would think it means actual default behaviors.
[12:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> But maybe Chrome is acting like the default behavior of the parent has changed because of its touch-action value.
[12:40:29] <bethge> Ok, so if all elements between hit-test target and "nearest ancestor with default touch behaviour" allow it, then it is allowed
[12:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> But it's not clear to me what "nearest ancestor with default touch behaviour" means
[12:41:15] <bethge> yeah, same here.
[12:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like this is our big question for the week ;-)
[12:41:41] <bethge> :D
[12:41:43] <arschmitz> Yeah I interpreted how I wrote hammer
[12:41:47] <arschmitz> But could be wrong
[12:42:08] <arschmitz> Stops as soon as it gets an explicit value
[12:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> So we're all in agreement on what we think the spec says. That's good. :-)
[12:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[12:43:55] <arschmitz> Not I
[12:44:01] <bethge> Nope
[12:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> Alright. Thanks everyone.
[14:09:29] <arschmitz> apsdehal: agcolom: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: cgack: cogwurx: sfrisk: meeting time
[14:09:34] <sfrisk> allo
[14:09:39] <cogwurx> I'm here...finally
[14:09:56] <cgack> howdy
[14:10:21] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[14:10:30] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:12:35] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:13:22] <cogwurx> apologies for being MIA for a month. got slammed with lots of stuff
[14:13:36] <arschmitz> no problem
[14:13:40] <arschmitz> summer is always that way
[14:14:09] <apsdehal__> A lot of activity by Jasper this week, great work!
[14:14:18] <arschmitz> yes just reviewed all those
[14:14:20] <arschmitz> and some more
[14:15:02] <apsdehal__> I forgot to land classes option PR, will land it during weekend
[14:15:39] <jasperdegroot> thanks
[14:17:10] <apsdehal__> A lot of new issues were also opened this week, sudden activity burst.
[14:17:33] <arschmitz> yes i went through all the new one
[14:17:35] <jasperdegroot> most of them by the same person
[14:18:52] <arschmitz> i made a little more progress on the guides this week i hope nxt week to have it wrapped up its been slow
[14:19:32] <gabrielschulhof> Is the git version getting updated in the CDN?
[14:19:38] <gabrielschulhof> ... of the library?
[14:19:39] <jasperdegroot> no
[14:19:48] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8515
[14:20:04] <gabrielschulhof> Dang!
[14:20:06] <arschmitz> yeah i need to look into why that is
[14:20:15] <arschmitz> i dont know any change that should have broke that
[14:20:18] <arschmitz> ohhhh yes i do
[14:20:20] <gabrielschulhof> I'm trying to update the popup docs, including the examples, to use data-ui-*
[14:20:21] <arschmitz> that was jenkins
[14:20:34] <arschmitz> i think we removed the old jenkins job
[14:20:35] <jasperdegroot> aha jenkins
[14:20:41] <arschmitz> cleaning up
[14:21:14] <apsdehal__> What was the old jenkins job?
[14:21:30] <arschmitz> we used to do CI through jenkins
[14:21:38] <arschmitz> and part of that job pushed each commit to the cdn
[14:21:52] <arschmitz> i forgot it did the cdn and dropped the tests
[14:21:57] <apsdehal__> Oh, ok! That seems long way back in past.
[14:22:08] <arschmitz> it just sat there failing for years
[14:22:11] <arschmitz> which is why i removed it
[14:22:15] <arschmitz> forgetting the cdn
[14:22:18] <arschmitz> was part of that
[14:22:31] <arschmitz> it was just a couple months ago
[14:22:43] <jasperdegroot> last build was June 18
[14:22:51] <arschmitz> sounds about right
[14:23:14] <jasperdegroot> is it easy to fix?
[14:23:21] <arschmitz> ill just copy the ui job minus tests
[14:23:23] <arschmitz> not a big deal
[14:23:27] <arschmitz> assign that issue to me
[14:23:29] <apsdehal__> It shows June 18, 2015, it should be June 18, 2016 I guess
[14:23:30] <gabrielschulhof> Awesome!
[14:23:36] <jasperdegroot> ah ok, nice
[14:23:50] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal__: I think that's the date of the commit, not the date of the build.
[14:24:10] <arschmitz> which would be master before we updated for 1.5
[14:24:15] <gabrielschulhof> Yep.
[14:24:21] <apsdehal__> Hmm, version is 1.5-pre
[14:24:35] <gabrielschulhof> Yes, because we update the version immediately after a release.
[14:24:45] <arschmitz> yup
[14:29:42] <arschmitz> ok so does anyone have anything else?
[14:29:46] <arschmitz> apsdehal__: anything from you?
[14:30:01] <arschmitz> btw congrats on passing gsoc for another year great job on everything
[14:30:07] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'm starting to update the popup docs, but honestly, I don't have a lot of time towards it.
[14:30:15] <arschmitz> ok
[14:30:16] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal__: Awesome!
[14:30:26] <arschmitz> docs are top priority right now
[14:30:31] <arschmitz> so keep with that
[14:30:41] <apsdehal__> I am reading up on hammer
[14:30:46] <apsdehal__> Thanks
[14:31:14] <apsdehal__> Didn't get much time this week, new school , new city, new country and all other stuff
[14:31:38] <apsdehal__> Now things are in place, so I will try to make up in the weekend
[14:32:01] <arschmitz> of course no problem
[14:32:03] <gabrielschulhof> Sounds like quite a whirlwind - a fun whirlwind :)
[14:32:15] <apsdehal__> It is :D
[14:32:42] <apsdehal__> NYC is huge
[14:33:49] * gabrielschulhof nods
[14:34:41] <arschmitz> apsdehal__: yeah for sure
[14:34:55] <arschmitz> apsdehal__: i might be driving through in next couple of month
[14:34:59] <arschmitz> ill let you know if i am
[14:35:11] <apsdehal__> Sure! That would be great
[14:42:14] <arschmitz> ok if there is nothing else lets call it a day
[14:42:34] <arschmitz> glad every one is back in the swing again and hopefully 1.5 in next 2 weeks
[14:42:47] <cogwurx> woo! see you all next time
[14:43:37] <jasperdegroot> later all
[14:43:50] <gabrielschulhof> L8R
