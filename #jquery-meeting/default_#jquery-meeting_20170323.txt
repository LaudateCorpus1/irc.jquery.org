[14:04:08] <arschmitz> @apsdehal @cogwurx meeting
[14:04:25] <apsdehal> Hi
[14:06:00] <apsdehal> No one else seems around
[14:07:00] <arschmitz> nope
[14:07:46] <arschmitz> i commented on your PR i think we should backfill but we also ( as a seperate issue ) explain in each 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 what is supported
[14:08:13] <apsdehal> So 1.5 => 1.12
[14:08:18] <arschmitz> yup
[14:08:19] <apsdehal> and 1.4 => ?
[14:08:26] <arschmitz> 1.10
[14:08:30] <apsdehal> and 1.3?
[14:08:50] <arschmitz> i dont know it was just copied and pasted in then
[14:08:56] <arschmitz> but i think it was from 1.9
[14:09:01] <apsdehal> I will make the required changes then
[14:12:11] <arschmitz> execlent
[14:12:22] <arschmitz> once thats done and we confirm its live we will post blog
[14:12:57] <apsdehal> Ok, you should check on the part of deploying 1.4 in 1.4 section
[14:14:18] <cogwurx> hello
[14:16:18] <apsdehal> Hey cogwurx
[14:16:28] <cogwurx> sorry was called a way for a bit.
[14:21:47] <arschmitz> hey
[14:22:06] <arschmitz> @apsdehal not sure what you mean?
[14:24:29] <apsdehal> So, I added a new section for 1.4
[14:24:46] <apsdehal> So the latest should point to latest tag 1.5
[14:25:20] <apsdehal> But it still shows 1.4's data
[14:26:16] <apsdehal> I tested on my local vagrant
[14:35:22] <arschmitz> oh its order dependant
[14:35:38] <arschmitz> it should stil ldefault to 1.4 when you go to the site
[14:35:49] <arschmitz> but should show 1.5 if you go to /1.5
[14:36:16] <arschmitz> once 1.5 final is done we will switch to default to 1.5
