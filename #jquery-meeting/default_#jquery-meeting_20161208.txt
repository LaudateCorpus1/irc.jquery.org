[14:11:25] <arschmitz> so i dont have much to report i didnt get blog post done because i was really sick all week

[14:11:50] <apsdehal> hi
[14:12:11] <apsdehal> arschmitz: get well soon
[14:12:19] <apsdehal> I am reviewing the changelog at the moment
[14:12:24] <cogwurx> no worries. been dealing with that sort of thing with the family for a month or two. public school is a petri dish of disease that my kids keep bringing home\
[14:12:30] <arschmitz> lol
[14:12:51] <apsdehal> lol
[14:12:52] <arschmitz> i work from home limits exposure but the child always gets me lol
[14:13:07] <cogwurx> germ factories!
[14:13:11] <cogwurx> but they are cute
[14:13:17] <apsdehal> I thought public schools were good here
[14:14:23] <cogwurx> in the US?
[14:14:28] <apsdehal> Yes
[14:15:15] <cogwurx> ed wise, it's fine, but still hygiene is an issue with kindergartners
[14:16:26] <cogwurx> and my kid is susceptible to lung issues/congestion and it lasts longer than it should....tmi
[14:16:37] <arschmitz> hygiene is an issue with any large group of people children are just worse lol
[14:17:54] <cogwurx> indeed!
[14:18:34] <arschmitz> so thats all i have ill send the blog post to everyone ASAP
[14:19:00] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Will you fix the review comments on Changelog, or should I open up a PR?
