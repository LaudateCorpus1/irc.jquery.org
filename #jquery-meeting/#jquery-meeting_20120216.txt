[11:03:34] <johnbender> sorry I thought todd needed two minutes
[11:03:42] * johnbender looses track of time whilst working
[11:04:46] <johnbender> waiting on the pinwheel of superfuntimes
[11:04:49] <Wilto> No, no, he does. You’re still getting a demerit, though.
[11:10:50] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:11:00] <toddparker> jQuery Mobile meeting
[11:11:51] <toddparker> John bender is working on the /test/ build stuff
[11:12:01] <toddparker> and the "don't enhance within"
[11:26:52] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3282
[11:26:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3282 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (2m, 2d ago): Fool-proof link buttons from button methods
[11:28:17] <toddparker> we're going to make sure that the framework doesn't double enhance buttons if you call disable
[11:28:44] <toddparker> but we're not going to support the enable/disable methods on link based buttons
[11:28:49] <toddparker> it's sort of an odd use case
