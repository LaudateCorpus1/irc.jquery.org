[10:58:49] <johnbender> hi!
[10:58:55] <gseguin> Yo
[10:59:33] <johnbender> going to get breakfast
[10:59:35] <johnbender> so hungry
[10:59:38] <johnbender> my insides are on fire
[11:00:42] <gseguin> johnbender: 11am is not breakfast
[11:01:47] * johnbender engages in hot dog construction
[11:01:49] <johnbender> brb
[11:02:47] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:03:03] * _|Nix|_ waves @ all
[11:03:09] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:03:10] <arschmitz> hello everyone
[11:03:29] <toddmparker> everyone have a hot dog at the ready?
[11:03:40] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay! Remembered the altered timezone difference!
[11:03:45] <toddmparker> nice _|Nix|_
[11:03:50] <toddmparker> 3rd time is a charm
[11:04:11] <toddmparker> The jury Mobile team meeting is a GO
[11:04:17] <_|Nix|_> I'm eating a conconction involving eggs, ham, and cheese ... kinda like a panzerotti, but instead of dough, it's ham.
[11:04:21] <toddmparker> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LfbdY8zmqk4ghgBVGXkIs63uI56Vpa_9NbcGLvufEwA/edit#
[11:04:48] <toddmparker> Maintenance releases went out last week for legacy versions. These were delayed until after 1.3 but still useful for people stuck on older versions.
[11:04:48] <toddmparker> 1.1.2 - http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/03/19/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-2/
[11:04:49] <toddmparker> 1.2.1 - http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/03/22/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-1/
[11:05:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we we will be back at 6 hours difference next week :)
[11:05:12] <toddmparker> cool
[11:05:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[11:05:17] <toddmparker> 1.3.1 in the works, to be released within a week. Moving towards more frequent maintenance releases.
[11:05:31] <toddmparker> I just realized my 1.3.1 change log was against master :(
[11:05:37] <toddmparker> so i have a jump on 1.4.0
[11:05:48] <toddmparker> but I need to update the blog post based on changes in 1.3-stable
[11:06:25] <toddmparker> for 1.3.1, I think we should pick a target release date now
[11:06:31] <gseguin> We're the jury? what are we judging on?
[11:06:42] <uGoMobi> I think we said 10 days last week
[11:06:49] <toddmparker> right
[11:06:58] <uGoMobi> so beginning next week?
[11:07:02] <agcolom> hi
[11:07:03] <toddmparker> i'd like to get it out by this time next week at the latest
[11:07:09] <gseguin> are we doing rc ?
[11:07:10] <_|Nix|_> Do we have a lot of 1.3.1 bugs?
[11:07:28] <toddmparker> we're not doing an RC for maintenance releases going forward
[11:07:33] <gseguin> ok
[11:07:46] <toddmparker> which will let us release these every 3-4 weeks
[11:08:01] <toddmparker> so we have a bunch of issues in the 1.3.1 milestone
[11:08:01] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=23&page=1&state=open
[11:08:19] <toddmparker> i've been triaging and moving these forward to 1.3.2 and even 1.4.0
[11:08:57] <toddmparker> i'd like to propose we have a code freeze EOD monday
[11:09:11] <gseguin> I like that
[11:09:22] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:09:27] <toddmparker> so the question is what handful of issues do we want to try and get fixed by then?
[11:09:38] <toddmparker> rather look at it that way
[11:09:50] <johnbender> +1
[11:10:13] <toddmparker> what are the top 5 issues we think we can fix by then?
[11:10:18] * _|Nix|_ picked the wrong time to go on vacation ... *sscratch head*
[11:10:18] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=23&page=1&state=open
[11:10:36] <_|Nix|_> I think we should check the nav ones and see if https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5800 fixed any of them
[11:10:36] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5800 by gabrielschulhof (6d 5h ago): A fix for issue #5775
[11:11:12] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: you on vacation right now?
[11:11:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I will be in a few hours :)
[11:11:42] <uGoMobi_> sorry IRC disconnected
[11:11:42] <toddmparker> cool…for a week?
[11:11:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah.
[11:11:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Ridin' the back of Easter.
[11:11:58] <uGoMobi> 2 of those issues are missing refresh methods
[11:11:58] <uGoMobi> table and panel
[11:12:10] <uGoMobi_> ah... with delay ^^
[11:12:25] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah refresh is another item too
[11:13:30] * gseguin will be right back
[11:13:42] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: do you have time to review the nag related issues and either close them or move them out?
[11:13:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yes.
[11:13:54] <toddmparker> nav…ugh autocorrecect
[11:13:58] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: super
[11:15:09] <toddmparker> johnbender: this base tag issue = 1.4? 1.3.2?
[11:15:09] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3978
[11:15:09] <b-ot> toddmparker: Issue #3978 by johnbender (11mon 3w ago): Base tag support issues
[11:15:09] <toddmparker> not for this week for sure
[11:16:18] <johnbender> toddmparker: sigh
[11:16:34] <johnbender> toddmparker: 1.3.2 should be fine
[11:16:34] <toddmparker> unless your'e fired up
[11:16:34] <johnbender> toddmparker: it might even be merged lol
[11:16:34] <johnbender> toddmparker: let me check
[11:16:36] <toddmparker> ok
[11:16:48] <toddmparker> re: the missing refresh method for table and panel
[11:17:03] <toddmparker> I think these 3 issues in 1.3.1 would be fixed by that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Refresh+addition&milestone=23&page=1&state=open
[11:17:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: nope it's not merged
[11:17:18] <toddmparker> maybe others out there
[11:17:28] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'll make that my first order of business after this refactor is finished
[11:17:32] <toddmparker> johnbender: is it merge-able?
[11:17:49] <johnbender> toddmparker: should be but it needs testing
[11:17:53] <toddmparker> ok, so should we tentatively leave that in 1.3.1
[11:17:59] <johnbender> we had issues with it before but I haven't been able to reproduce them
[11:18:53] <toddmparker> gotcha. let me know if you need testing help on devices
[11:19:11] <toddmparker> so let's make a call on adding refresh...
[11:19:19] <uGoMobi_> yeah
[11:19:33] <uGoMobi_> frequent created a PR for table
[11:19:48] <toddmparker> i'd vote to add it even if it crosses the line with semver
[11:20:06] <toddmparker> waiting for 1.4 is too long for something that important
[11:20:06] * gseguin is back
[11:20:34] <arschmitz> for 1.4 _|Nix|_ already made these proper extensions with refresh methods right _|Nix|_?
[11:21:14] <toddmparker> if that's true, could we cherry pick it back?
[11:21:35] <toddmparker> or did anything change with the API when they were made into proper extensions?
[11:21:42] <toddmparker> (assuming no)
[11:21:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[11:22:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You wanna cherry-pick the make-proper-extension stuff into 1.3-stable?
[11:22:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I did not add refresh methods.
[11:22:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I simply made them extensions.
[11:23:16] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: ah, then let's not add any code churn just for the extensions
[11:23:22] <toddmparker> for 1.3.1
[11:23:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Definitely not.
[11:23:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... especially since I didn't just blindly convert them to extensions. There was a lot of code cleanup to be done as well.
[11:24:03] <toddmparker> right
[11:24:21] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: did you review frequent's PR?
[11:24:24] <toddmparker> ok, so back to the original Q - add refresh to panels and the two table plugins. +1 or -1
[11:24:35] <uGoMobi_> +1
[11:24:37] <toddmparker> +1
[11:24:44] <arschmitz> did he update it?
[11:24:55] <arschmitz> if he did i missed that
[11:24:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: How can we add refresh methods to the table plugins if they're not proper extensions?
[11:24:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^?
[11:25:01] <uGoMobi_> not sure
[11:25:41] <arschmitz> ok looking now
[11:25:53] <toddmparker> is adding a refresh method contingent on how the extension is structured?
[11:25:54] <arschmitz> tests are failing
[11:26:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: NM. I withdraw my question. Still not as clean as adding refresh methods when they're proper extensions.
[11:26:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Nono. We can add the method per-instance.
[11:26:23] <toddmparker> ok
[11:26:44] <uGoMobi_> refresh method for panel shouldn't be too hard
[11:26:56] <toddmparker> arschmitz, gseguin, _|Nix|_, johnbender - adding refresh for 1.3.1
[11:26:59] <toddmparker> +1 or -1?
[11:27:07] <uGoMobi_> I suppose we can move things from create to refresh and have create call refresh
[11:27:20] <arschmitz> im a bit hesitant because of semvar but i guess im ok with it
[11:27:43] <gseguin> sorry in advance
[11:27:49] <gseguin> add refresh to what?
[11:28:11] <arschmitz> hmm im not sure about the pr though it adds a special tableupdate event it listens for
[11:28:23] <johnbender> ahh table
[11:28:23] <johnbender> hmm
[11:28:23] <arschmitz> rather then a refresh
[11:28:41] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: right
[11:28:43] <johnbender> can we just provide the workaround?
[11:28:51] <johnbender> with a widget extension?
[11:29:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If we add refresh we'll have to add it twice, because in master we'd have to add it as a proper widget method, and in 1.3-stable we'd have to add it as a $.extend on top of the widget instance during "tablebeforecreate" ...
[11:29:20] <toddmparker> i'm good with whatever approach we take, but it would be good to make this possible before 1.4
[11:29:33] <gseguin> is adding it breaking anything?
[11:29:33] <arschmitz> no because its not a widget so it cant be properly extended
[11:29:50] <johnbender> gseguin: no but semver says patch releases are bug only
[11:30:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.extend( $( e.target ).data( "mobile-table" ), { refresh: function() {} } ) is what I'm thinking.
[11:30:27] <gseguin> isn't it a bug that there is no refresh method on that widget?
[11:31:26] <arschmitz> _|yeah but reflow and column toggle are not part of the widget they are not widgets at all
[11:31:40] <arschmitz> they are just delagated event bindings
[11:31:56] <arschmitz> gseguin widgets make no promise of a refresh method
[11:32:10] <arschmitz> and the column toggle and reflow modes are not widgets
[11:32:15] <toddmparker> gseguin: i kinda of think of it that way
[11:32:27] <toddmparker> becomes somewhat unusable
[11:32:42] <arschmitz> i do agree its a big issue though which is why im on the fence about it
[11:33:07] <toddmparker> at least in dynamic situations. you'd need to generate a new table and call the plugin on it
[11:34:03] <toddmparker> so is this possible to add in the current state of things?
[11:34:16] <toddmparker> technically, not semver-wise
[11:35:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's definitely possible, but, like I said, it would have to be done twice.
[11:35:25] <arschmitz> and the pr right now will not work
[11:35:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The body of the refresh function would be almost identical, but it will have to be taken from one version and dropped into the place that is correct for the other version.
[11:35:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Will it work against 1.3-stable.
[11:35:45] <_|Nix|_> ?
[11:36:00] <arschmitz> its never passed tests not sure exact cause
[11:36:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, this can't be cherry-picked.
[11:36:06] <arschmitz> and i think it would need some work
[11:36:54] <toddmparker> so i'm inclined to punt on refresh for 1.3.1
[11:37:01] <arschmitz> so i guess if we dont care about semvar its a issue of effort
[11:37:09] <arschmitz> because the pr needs work
[11:37:16] <toddmparker> maybe move it to 1.3.2 for now so we can re-consider for that
[11:37:40] <arschmitz> frequent really wants it and has been working on some other stuff too
[11:37:49] <arschmitz> so maybe we can kick the pr back to him for more work
[11:38:20] <toddmparker> sure
[11:38:25] <arschmitz> but yeah punt on 1.3.1 i think
[11:38:33] <toddmparker> he just might need some guidance
[11:38:36] <toddmparker> yeah, ok
[11:38:37] <gseguin> I've already asked him to do the merge with master this morning because as it is it doesn't merge cleanly
[11:38:43] <toddmparker> moved those out and a few others
[11:38:45] <arschmitz> yeah i think so iv been helping him with his filter widget
[11:39:04] <arschmitz> hes eager to learn and get it right so i think he will fix it up if i i let him know what it needs
[11:39:39] <_|Nix|_> Can we talk briefly about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5608?
[11:39:39] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5608 by damnsecure (1mon 2w ago): Closing a dialog or using data-rel=back on dialog does back twice
[11:40:10] <_|Nix|_> In that bug, the guy opens a dialog by doing changePage with changeHash: false, and then he calls dialog.close()
[11:40:19] <_|Nix|_> So, of course it's gonna go back two history entries!
[11:40:33] <_|Nix|_> ... because no history entry is created during open.
[11:40:38] <toddmparker> so is this a bug then?
[11:40:58] <gseguin> no
[11:41:10] <gseguin> ( that's my vote )
[11:41:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I don't think so. Adding this special case handling is not something we want to do.
[11:41:25] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[11:41:31] <_|Nix|_> I'll close it with an explanation.
[11:41:43] <toddmparker> ok, cool

[11:41:56] <uGoMobi_> (agcolom just sent tweet that's she lost connection... her updates are in the agenda)
[11:42:03] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: what's your take on this one?
[11:42:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not a bug :(
[11:42:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'd say :)
[11:43:16] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: johnbender said he was going to look at that one
[11:43:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: which one?
[11:43:39] <johnbender> the media query one?

[11:43:52] <uGoMobi_> updatePagePadding
[11:44:10] <johnbender> haven't had time yet I guess
[11:44:14] <toddmparker> i could ask scott jehl
[11:45:06] <uGoMobi_> I can do more debugging tomorrow
[11:45:13] <uGoMobi_> to see what is causing it
[11:45:35] <toddmparker> i just asked scott to give it a look
[11:45:39] <uGoMobi_> ok thanks
[11:45:44] <toddmparker> if you want some eyes on it
[11:46:57] <toddmparker> ok, cool

[11:50:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Looking at it.
[11:50:40] <toddmparker> just want to know if it's a regression and if we should try to look at this for monday
[11:51:31] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah definitely a regression
[11:51:45] <johnbender> toddmparker: _|Nix|_ I think that's fixed by teh change _|Nix|_ put in
[11:51:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Unfortunately not.
[11:51:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no?
[11:52:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I thought so too.
[11:52:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know, weird, eh?
[11:52:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it says on inital load too

[11:52:19] <johnbender> huh
[11:52:28] <johnbender> ugh
[11:52:40] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah we should address that one for Monday
[11:53:11] <toddmparker> hrm, ok. blocker?

[11:56:54] <toddmparker> we're just triaging 1.3.1 issues
[11:56:57] <toddmparker> down to 5 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=23&state=open

[11:57:10] <agcolom> ok, thx :-) +
[11:57:23] <toddmparker> that seem like a good list? agcolom - targeting a code freeze monday eod for 1.3.1

[11:57:44] <agcolom> ok, I'm offline from tomorrow!
[11:57:50] <agcolom> (until 15th April)
[11:57:59] <toddmparker> have a nice time off
[11:58:10] <agcolom> thx ;-)
[11:59:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe the 200ms timer is firing before the initial popstate.
[11:59:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... causing the initial popstate to not be ignored.
[11:59:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We might want to get rid of that 200ms timer and sniff for Webkit :(

[12:04:20] <johnbender> don't put any tests in tests/integration/ unless you talk to me first
[12:04:32] <johnbender> thanks to gseguin for doing all the work
[12:04:41] <johnbender> you can run unit tests only by doing --types=unit
[12:04:48] <johnbender> or --types=integration for integration
[12:04:49] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[12:05:02] <johnbender> --suites=foo --types=unit works as expected
[12:05:13] <johnbender> it runs the tests in tests/unit/foo
[12:05:18] <toddmparker> cool
[12:05:24] <uGoMobi_> anyone noticed before that hideDuringFocus doesn't work on Android 2.3 ? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5556#issuecomment-15607989
[12:05:25] <b-ot> uGoMobi_: Issue #5556 by pupvogel (1mon 3w ago): fixed toolbars unfix after softkeyboard
[12:05:29] <toddmparker> so you can easily run a subset
[12:05:45] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: nope
[12:05:51] <arschmitz> yes
[12:05:54] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you mention "working on two range slider issues for 1.3.1"
[12:06:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi there is an old issue about that
[12:06:09] <toddmparker> are those tagged for the milestone and open? don't see 'em
[12:06:15] <arschmitz> i almost want to say that we decided not fixable
[12:06:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can we talk about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5579 after the meeting?
[12:06:16] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5579 by ottoville (1mon 3w ago): pagechange trigger two times
[12:06:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker: no they dont have a milestone i noticed it missing last night but forgot to fix it
[12:06:40] <uGoMobi_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Rangeslider&milestone=&page=1&state=open
[12:06:48] <uGoMobi_> ^^ rangeslider issues
[12:07:29] <toddmparker> ok, tagged
[12:07:40] <arschmitz> would like to get those fixed they are both ugly
[12:07:45] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: ok thanks will look for that ticket
[12:07:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sure
[12:08:11] <toddmparker> nice, be good to have you guys huddle on those nav items
[12:08:59] <toddmparker> anything else we should talk about here?
[12:09:01] <uGoMobi_> also noticed that focusin and focusout fires twice if you focus on a form element
[12:09:12] <toddmparker> any?
[12:09:26] <uGoMobi_> that caused issues with fixed toolbars but can think it could cause other issues as well
[12:09:28] <uGoMobi_> yeah
[12:09:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for select android does not fire change on keyboard close
[12:09:53] <uGoMobi_> didn't test all but select and text input for sure
[12:09:56] <arschmitz> or i mean foucus out
[12:10:13] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: I think I fixed that
[12:10:23] <arschmitz> ok
[12:11:28] <toddmparker> cool
[12:11:54] <toddmparker> if there are any other issues you're looking at for 1.3.1, just try and mark 'em to the milestone
[12:12:05] <uGoMobi_> will do
[12:12:06] <toddmparker> any questions from the community?
[12:12:37] <agcolom> did you get my update?
[12:12:52] <gseguin> did I miss my turn?
[12:13:39] <johnbender> gseguin: we skipped updates
[12:13:46] <gseguin> oh ok
[12:13:55] <gseguin> sorry I missed that
[12:14:25] <agcolom> same here...
[12:14:35] <toddmparker> pipe up if you have things you'd like to discuss gseguin
[12:14:47] <toddmparker> just might not be enough time for people to go thru every point
[12:15:03] <gseguin> nothing really important
[12:15:29] <gseguin> Just wanted to mention that if you have the deploy keys
[12:15:48] <gseguin> just doing `grunt deploy` will build and deploy the version in your workspace
[12:16:48] <gseguin> same goes for `grunt release --releaseBranch=1.3-stable --releaseVersion=1.3.1`
[12:17:06] <gseguin> but this one has to be follow by a manual `git push`
[12:17:23] <gseguin> and the `release` target will do a deploy for you
[12:17:30] <toddmparker> cool. looking forward to the new system
[12:17:46] <toddmparker> mind making a basecamp post or wiki page?
[12:18:05] <gseguin> there are a bunch of safegards to prevent messups, hopefully enough of them
[12:18:13] <gseguin> I'll make a wiki page
[12:18:37] <toddmparker> great
[12:18:47] <toddmparker> ok, thanks everyone. we can keep chatting over on -dev
[12:18:58] <uGoMobi_> later all
[12:19:14] <gseguin> alright, see you on -dev. Turning off the lights.
