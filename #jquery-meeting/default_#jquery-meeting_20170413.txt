[14:01:28] <arschmitz> apsdehal: cogwurx meeting time
[14:01:53] <apsdehal> Hi
[14:02:39] <cogwurx> Hello!!
[14:02:57] <arschmitz> so i just published the api site
[14:03:09] <arschmitz> but its not showing living yet waiting to see if there is an issue or just being slow
[14:03:14] <cogwurx> üëç
[14:03:15] <arschmitz> i also published to npm
[14:03:38] <arschmitz> so once site is live just need to publish the blog post
[14:04:35] <rotb> props to you guys, we've been lookin forward to this release
[14:05:38] <apsdehal> awesome
[14:05:45] <apsdehal> I will try to fix the docs issues (wrong version number, grammatical mistakes etc.) when I get time, this week has been heavy on me.
[14:05:59] <arschmitz> @rotb thank you
[14:06:16] <arschmitz> im also going to add into the blog post that we are looking for more help and team members
[14:06:45] <arschmitz> try to fill our numbers back up to where they were so we can get a quick turn around on 1.6
[14:06:46] <apsdehal> Yes, I think it was easy for me when I was totally free lol
[14:07:13] <apsdehal> Now, with grad courses and last month of semester it is very rough.
[14:07:32] <arschmitz> @apsdehal happens to the best of us
[14:07:45] <arschmitz> but as long as you can keep putting in some amount of time on a fairly regular basis
[14:07:59] <apsdehal> Having extra hands on team would be really helpful.
[14:08:03] <arschmitz> yes
[14:08:06] <cogwurx> indeed
[14:08:27] <arschmitz> the foundation change caused us to lose a couple of our oldest contributors which hurt us
[14:08:33] <arschmitz> we need to refill our ranks
[14:08:57] <arschmitz> 1.6 will be a small and focused release though
[14:09:13] <apsdehal> Hmm, and we didn't get a chance for GSoC this time.
[14:09:17] <arschmitz> switching to hammer and removing deprecated code mostly
[14:09:33] <arschmitz> yeah i wish he had but i just didnt have time to do it all by my self
[14:10:07] <arschmitz> i have always run it jointly with another person
[14:10:12] <apsdehal> Next year I can probably mentor.
[14:10:30] <arschmitz> yeah it was more the admin that was the issue this year
[14:10:57] <arschmitz> there was always 2 people doing it before myself and one other
[14:11:04] <arschmitz> and they decided they could not do it this year
[14:11:24] <arschmitz> but we will just make the best of it
[14:11:41] <arschmitz> so if anyone lurking is interested or apsdehal or cogwurx you know anyone
[14:11:55] <arschmitz> they can either just start showing up to meetings or on irc or can email me
[14:12:09] <apsdehal> I will see in my student group at undergrad college if anyone is interested
[14:12:21] <arschmitz> looks great on a resume
[14:12:27] <apsdehal> Yep.
[14:12:31] <cogwurx> I'll ask around...
[14:12:53] <apsdehal> I hope blog post will also help.
[14:13:04] <arschmitz> yup im hoping
[14:13:41] <rotb> Soliciting in this Github issue probably wouldn't hurt: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8546 -- a lot of people have commented and they get automatically notified of any replies
[14:13:51] <rotb> I'll probably have some time to help out with 1.6
[14:14:03] <arschmitz> rotb: execlent look for ward
[14:14:20] <arschmitz> and good idea ill mention it when i close that issue once the blog post is up
[14:16:30] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Blog will be up here, http://blog.jquery.com/ right?
[14:18:51] <arschmitz> yup
[14:22:53] <arschmitz> looks like api didnt go to production still stuck in staging
[14:27:01] <apsdehal> Does it take time or is it permanently stuck with some error?
[14:31:59] <arschmitz> it should not take more then 5 minutes
[14:32:02] <arschmitz> it runs on a cron
[14:32:14] <arschmitz> no i take that back thats view
[14:32:19] <arschmitz> api is a webhook
[14:32:34] <arschmitz> it runs as soon as the tag and should not take more then a couple minutes
[14:32:41] <arschmitz> so i need to ping infrastructure
[14:32:57] <arschmitz> why does nothing ever deploy like it should...
