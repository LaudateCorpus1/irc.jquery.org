[09:01:34] <jzaefferer> UI meeting time! Ping scott_gonzalez arschmitz gnarf kborchers mikesherov petersendidit gabriel_schulhof
[09:02:35] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: Want to start with button?
[09:02:54] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[09:03:25] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i dont really have much update on button i just pushed updates for classes to a branch but im fixing one small thing
[09:03:39] <arschmitz> then ill rebase the button branch with that and push the updated button branch
[09:03:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Pong!
[09:04:17] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:04:23] <jzaefferer> same for checkboxradio and controlgroup?
[09:04:36] <arschmitz> yes sorry meant button branch not button widget specificly
[09:04:42] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:05:00] <arschmitz> so for classes though i fixed all the null values as well
[09:05:05] <jzaefferer> did you update the wiki regarding two icons back compat?
[09:05:09] <mikesherov> hi
[09:05:29] <arschmitz> so once i fix tooltip and rebase that should fix everything we have talked about with classes
[09:05:32] <jzaefferer> null values? What was that about?
[09:05:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: oh no ill do it right now
[09:05:52] * rxaviers is now in
[09:05:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we decided like a month or 2 ago that the values should be empty strings rather then null
[09:06:03] <arschmitz> but no one ever actually fixed it
[09:06:15] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:06:21] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: that way you can do value += " new-class"
[09:07:24] <jzaefferer> makes sense
[09:07:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez rxaviers: did anything happen on datepicker? Felix isn't around, I haven't seen anything new from him
[09:07:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Ummm ... if I may interject. I don't mean to step on any toes or anything, but I kinda wrote the _setOptions implementation for classes a while back, and as far as I can tell, this is not that different. So, ummm ... it's kinda awkward ... I feel really bad about bringing this up ...
[09:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard anything from Felix.
[09:08:23] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, not from my side. I'm waiting his PR to land before resuming work there
[09:09:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay. As long as you're busy elsewhere, that should be okay
[09:09:18] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: updates on Globalize?
[09:09:26] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:10:11] <rxaviers> first one is the creation of globalization-javascript mailing list.
[09:10:58] <jzaefferer> ah, right. I haven't seen an invite to that...
[09:11:00] <rxaviers> So far we have Dojo, Google, IBM, Intl.js, us from jQuery, messageformat.js, moment.js, Wikipedia and Yahoo folks
[09:11:14] <rxaviers> Have you receive the "Welcome" email though?
[09:11:43] <jzaefferer> Was that from you or the mailing list?
[09:11:49] <rxaviers> The list has already been used by Yahoo folks to announce their formatjs website.
[09:11:56] <rxaviers> from me to the mailing list
[09:12:17] <rxaviers> http://formatjs.io/
[09:13:47] <rxaviers> On Globalize, we had a couple of minor fixes.
[09:14:03] <rxaviers> Ah, I've landed timezone support
[09:15:17] <rxaviers> which fixed #196 https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/196
[09:15:33] <rxaviers> and leaves the Olson-timezone-support for #340 https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/340
[09:16:46] <rxaviers> There's a change I'd like feedback: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/345#issuecomment-59231910
[09:16:56] <rxaviers> which scott_gonzalez has just replied to.
[09:18:37] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: have any of our discussions with Yahoo made any difference in what they're doing?
[09:18:39] <rxaviers> cldr-data is Globalize's peer dependency already.
[09:18:51] <jzaefferer> My impression is that they've just kept going with what they had planned anyway
[09:18:58] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, no (or at least not so far)
[09:20:17] <rxaviers> They were about to launch this formatjs thing by the first time we've talked to them. I wasn't expecting am immediate change anyway. Although, I still do expect a position from them about cldr-data (the email thread)
[09:20:44] <jzaefferer> There was no response to your last message, right?
[09:20:57] <jzaefferer> Probably overlapped with their launch as well
[09:21:07] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, right
[09:21:33] <jzaefferer> Maybe start a thread about cldr-data on the new mailing list?
[09:21:40] <rxaviers> Still on cldr-data topic, I have ongoing discussion with IBM / Dojo
[09:22:50] <jzaefferer> Any interesting details?
[09:23:08] <rxaviers> I think it'll be more productive to have an agreement first with IBM/Dojo folks. It gives us more scale to announce in the mailing list
[09:23:34] <rxaviers> Yeap, John Emmons have this trac issue http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/7968
[09:24:02] <rxaviers> about breaking locale coverage into an intermediate set between core and full.
[09:24:48] <rxaviers> Talking to him, he actually mentioned 4 sizes:
[09:24:49] <rxaviers> "tier 1" is roughly equivalent to the "short list" of locales as defined in our current "json.zip".
[09:24:49] <rxaviers> "tier 2"" would be everything in tier 1" + additional locales as defined "Cldr - tier 2.
[09:24:49] <rxaviers> "modern" would everything defined as "modern coverage" languages in CLDR.
[09:24:49] <rxaviers> "all" would be all locales in the CLDR main directories ( not seed locales ).
[09:26:26] <jzaefferer> Okay, that seems fine
[09:26:39] <jzaefferer> Though might as well point to that trac issue
[09:26:44] <rxaviers> The problem is
[09:26:49] <jzaefferer> See if anyone has feedback on that before implementing it
[09:27:25] <rxaviers> John is still trying to experiment using a bower mirror, although I've already pointed to him the issues I had experimenting what he's going to.
[09:29:23] <rxaviers> Christopher and I are stressing some scenarios with him. So far cldr-data is the only solution that works
[09:29:41] <rxaviers> But, his locale coverage break down is still useful and can be used by cldr-data.
[09:31:50] <rxaviers> I guess this is it, unless anyone has any question
[09:32:12] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:32:23] <jzaefferer> We already covered classes option
[09:32:45] <jzaefferer> 1.11.2 has one blocker remaining, with a PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1358
[09:33:15] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: are you waiting for TJ to respond?
[09:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> No, I'm going to land it as soon as I get a working test release run.
[09:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> I was getting some npm errors this morning.
[09:34:48] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[09:35:00] <jzaefferer> so you were testing releasing 1.11.2?
[09:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:35:30] <jzaefferer> okay, nice
[09:35:49] <jzaefferer> Well, the menu PR is done, unless TJ gets more feedback, that will land in 1.12
[09:35:56] <jzaefferer> That's all
[09:37:52] <jzaefferer> thanks everyone
