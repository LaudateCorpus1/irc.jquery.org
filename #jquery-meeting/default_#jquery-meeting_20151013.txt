[14:10:27] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time
[14:10:32] <arthurvr> hey
[14:10:45] <sfrisk> sorry, momentarily forgot about the new time
[14:11:56] <sfrisk> Is anyone around? arschmitz?
[14:12:03] <arschmitz> im here
[14:12:07] <sfrisk> I haven't seen geekman-rohit today, just pinged kristyjy
[14:12:12] <kristyjy> here I am
[14:12:17] <sfrisk> (besides you arthurvr)
[14:13:04] <sfrisk> Okay, so I'll admit, not much has happened the past few weeks, fall tends to be a busy time of year for everyone
[14:13:29] <sfrisk> Jquery Summit is next weekend, so I'm planning on doing a lot of hacking during that on Chassis tasks, and we have the hackathon the following weekend too
[14:13:56] <sfrisk> or rather this weekend*
[14:14:05] <sfrisk> hackathon the weeken after that
[14:14:27] <arthurvr> Neat!
[14:14:30] <arthurvr> Thanks sfrisk!
[14:14:47] <arthurvr> (Sadly I canâ€™t be at the summit btw)
[14:14:48] <sfrisk> anyone who participates gets some Chassis stickers mailed to them
[14:14:55] <sfrisk> We'll miss you arthurvr :-(
[14:15:11] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/123
[14:16:03] <sfrisk> That's the list of stuff I want some focus on during the Summit and the hackathon weekend
[14:16:57] <sfrisk> Also I need to update our contributing guide with the new meeting time
[14:21:48] <sfrisk> *crickets*
[14:22:42] <sfrisk> Okay then, so if anyone is around online this weekend, I will do my best to be on IRC, since I'll be working at knocking out some of our big todos
[14:22:56] <sfrisk> and then the official hackathon the weekend after
[14:23:04] <sfrisk> See everyone later!
[14:23:14] <kristyjy> okay
