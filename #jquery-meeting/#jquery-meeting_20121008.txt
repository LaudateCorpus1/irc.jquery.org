[09:00:30] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:00:37] <DaveMethvin> oh the door is open already
[09:00:57] <mikesherov> hi
[09:01:05] <gibson042> I just helped myself to your Scotch; hope you don't mind
[09:01:17] <DaveMethvin> a man of taste
[09:01:26] <mikesherov> boom
[09:01:30] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042 gnarf mikesherov jaubourg rwaldron
[09:01:32] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[09:01:50] <DaveMethvin> so, i did get an agenda prepared
[09:01:59] <mikesherov> WOW
[09:02:10] <DaveMethvin> was busy tearing up walls this weekend, didnd't get much actuall jquery work done
[09:02:52] <DaveMethvin> jquery 1.8.3
[09:02:58] <DaveMethvin> might as well do it
[09:03:03] <mikesherov> so, we should just wontfix any ticket that has SVG in it
[09:03:23] <DaveMethvin> i was tryna figure out why things were changing as far as worked/broke
[09:03:32] <DaveMethvin> but it shouldn't be surprising since there are no unit tests
[09:03:39] <DaveMethvin> since we don't really support it
[09:03:48] <DaveMethvin> and i don't really want to go there
[09:03:54] <DaveMethvin> we are a DOM library
[09:04:00] <DaveMethvin> not an SVG library
[09:04:04] <mikesherov> so wontfix it
[09:04:09] <mikesherov> I'm doing it now
[09:04:11] <DaveMethvin> but people see a <tag> is a <tag>
[09:04:21] <DaveMethvin> to them svg and dom look alike
[09:04:27] <DaveMethvin> but it's just like baggage claim
[09:04:27] <mikesherov> so
[09:04:31] <DaveMethvin> many bags look alike
[09:04:35] <DaveMethvin> but only one is YOUR bag
[09:04:36] <mikesherov> I'm wontfix'ing then
[09:04:37] <DaveMethvin> so wontfix
[09:04:40] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:04:51] <mikesherov> rwaldron is currently fishing on an SVG ticket
[09:04:54] <mikesherov> wontfix it
[09:05:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's just wontfix them
[09:05:18] <DaveMethvin> we  have been trying to accomodate svg for years
[09:05:24] <DaveMethvin> and it's just one battle after another
[09:05:44] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil gibson042 how bout those sizzle tix
[09:05:56] <DaveMethvin> do those look fixable this week?
[09:06:05] <DaveMethvin> would be good to get it into 1.8.3 if possible
[09:06:27] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&summary=~SVG&or&status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&description=~SVG&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
[09:06:54] <gibson042> I don't yet know what's going on with the IE loop (12671)
[09:07:19] <gibson042> 12672 appears to be fixable by using needsContext in .children etc.
[09:07:52] <gibson042> 12673 appears to already be fixed (read: consistent) in edge, but maybe not working in the best way
[09:07:55] <gibson042> did I miss any?
[09:08:34] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 didn't we wontfix 12626?
[09:08:59] <mikesherov> I just wontfixed it
[09:09:08] <DaveMethvin> hmm, 1.8.1 was the perf-borked one that didn't use matchesSelector
[09:09:26] <DaveMethvin> i bet thats why it had a brief moment of un-wontfixedness
[09:09:42] <DaveMethvin> oh well it's borked again as it should be
[09:09:43] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:10:08] <DaveMethvin> where do people come up with these selectors?  "input[type='text']:first, :input[value='']:first"
[09:10:28] <DaveMethvin> our unit tests shoudl just use modem line noise
[09:10:29] <mikesherov> I just wontfix'ed all the SVG tixx
[09:10:32] <DaveMethvin> thanks mikesherov
[09:10:52] <mikesherov> np
[09:11:18] <DaveMethvin> so if you know of any  other tix for 1.8.3 let me know
[09:11:20] <rwaldron> mikesherov I am?
[09:11:20] <b-ot> rwaldron, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[09:11:28] <mikesherov> yeah, I think every new 1.8.x jQuery release should fix the known sizzle regressions at the time
[09:11:30] <rwaldron> I looked at it for exactly 30 minutes
[09:11:44] <mikesherov> except I won't help at all because Sizzle is a foreign language to me
[09:11:57] <mikesherov> rwaldron: I was being hyperbolic
[09:12:07] <DaveMethvin> i've run out of goats to sacrifice so i  leave it to gibson042 and timmywil
[09:12:09] <timmywil> sry here
[09:13:14] <DaveMethvin> alright, i'll bug everyone in the next coupla days on 1.8.3 so we can get that one out
[09:13:18] <timmywil> I haven't dug into the sizzle tix yet
[09:13:20] <DaveMethvin> on to the Summit!
[09:13:30] <mikesherov> I have "dev summit intern" ideas
[09:13:41] <DaveMethvin> evil grin
[09:14:00] <timmywil> but I will
[09:14:02] <timmywil> anyways
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> what are your ideas mikesherov
[09:14:30] <timmywil> Concerning triage, I'd like to at least spend some time working on bugs
[09:14:36] <mikesherov> 1. format all the code up to the latest style standards, and if Rick finds even one character out of space… ritual sacrifice
[09:14:53] <DaveMethvin> gulp
[09:15:06] <DaveMethvin> there go the rest of the goats
[09:15:37] <mikesherov> 2. upgrade to latest JSHint, turn on "enforce double quotes", same thing with rick and goats
[09:16:01] <timmywil> goats are cute
[09:16:24] <mikesherov> 3. convert all unit tests to the signature that includes the "expect" param in the function args where applicable
[09:16:26] <rwaldron> +9001
[09:16:55] <DaveMethvin> #2,3 should not have a lot of trouble, #1 could touch a lot of files and make merges painful so we might want to do that when we aren't doing so much in parallel
[09:17:14] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin, hence the hard intern nature of it all
[09:17:30] <DaveMethvin> make them suffer!
[09:17:35] <DaveMethvin> it's easy coding
[09:17:42] <mikesherov> 4. find and/or build a style guide sniffer
[09:18:06] <timmywil> hmm?
[09:18:33] <mikesherov> same way JSHint runs on grunt save
[09:18:40] <mikesherov> make it check for our style guide
[09:18:47] <timmywil> jshint does take care of some it already yea?
[09:18:56] <rwaldron> #4 seems lovely, but we might have to adjust our policies
[09:19:01] <rwaldron> there are several
[09:19:02] <rwaldron> ack
[09:19:14] <mikesherov> timmywil: it takes care of crockford's insane whitespace rules
[09:19:18] <rwaldron> there are several "use your judgement" scenerios
[09:19:27] <mikesherov> I'm fine with use your judgement
[09:19:36] <mikesherov> it should at least take care of the known violations
[09:19:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah but is the style sniffer? :D
[09:20:34] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov you want to add those to the wiki?
[09:20:54] <DaveMethvin> i will go through and find some other tix that we can tackle as well
[09:20:57] <mikesherov> like, rwaldron, you should never have to write: `func("string", obj) => func( "string", obj)` again
[09:21:18] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: add them as issues?
[09:21:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:21:31] <mikesherov> I'm not totally clear on how to use the dev-summit github
[09:21:32] <timmywil> except right now cause mike missed a space
[09:21:37] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:21:41] <DaveMethvin> goats, please
[09:21:45] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[09:22:03] <mikesherov> OK, I'll add all of those
[09:22:03] * DaveMethvin makes note to get more goats before next week
[09:22:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we're gonna need a herd
[09:22:31] <mikesherov> then I have all the insane triage tasks I mailed out, timmywil: DaveMethvin: did those seem ok?
[09:22:33] <rwaldron> mikesherov  you mean:`func("string", obj) => func( "string", obj )`
[09:22:35] <rwaldron> right?
[09:22:40] <rwaldron> ;)
[09:22:41] <mikesherov> :-)
[09:22:44] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:22:50] <timmywil> mikesherov: those are great
[09:22:57] <rwaldron> (you missed a space between obj and ) )
[09:23:06] <DaveMethvin> we can make the list bigger and then have our recruits help us whittle them down
[09:23:07] <gibson042> jQuery Summit 2012: we're gonna need a bigger goat (herd)
[09:23:08] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:23:30] <timmywil> lol, summit tagline right there
[09:23:40] <mikesherov> ok, i gotta run gents
[09:23:42] <DaveMethvin> also i want to make sure we've contacted the folks this week so we know they're ready
[09:23:42] <mikesherov> sorry
[09:23:44] <DaveMethvin> thanks mikesherov
[09:24:04] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: as in we should email the people at our table?
[09:24:07] <DaveMethvin> basically just ask if they've got the software installed and a clone of the repo
[09:24:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:24:21] <DaveMethvin> just to introduce ourselves
[09:24:25] <DaveMethvin> it should be kind of fun
[09:25:21] <DaveMethvin> i want to make sure every person has some tasks they can do, they'll need some hand holding but we can do bug triage or whatever while they're puzzling out how to do their task
[09:25:56] <DaveMethvin> so i'm hoping for productive but also getting a few new guys up to speed and perhaps contributing long term
[09:26:58] <DaveMethvin> just looking at the wiki for a sec
[09:27:33] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil  you and mikesherov are on core triage
[09:27:57] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano shoudl have the list of people on your table to contact
[09:28:39] <DaveMethvin> I'll contact the people at the core bugs table and cc gibson042 and jaubourg
[09:29:03] <DaveMethvin> our tables will be together so i suspect we'll be talking a lot
[09:29:45] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then
[09:29:51] <DaveMethvin> voting!!!
[09:30:08] <DaveMethvin> vote like the bugs of the free world depended on it!
[09:30:25] <DaveMethvin> and let's defer assigned tix until after the summit
[09:30:46] <DaveMethvin> EOF
[09:31:02] <DaveMethvin> any other items for today?
[09:31:21] <DaveMethvin> the main things to do are 1.8.3 and Summit prepo
[09:32:16] <DaveMethvin> cool, we're done
[09:32:19] <timmywil> and voting
[09:32:29] <DaveMethvin> ok, 3 things!
[09:32:31] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:32:34] <timmywil> :)
[09:32:55] <DaveMethvin> see you guys next week!
