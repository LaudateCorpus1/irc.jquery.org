[08:40:38] <leobalter> o/
[08:40:47] <leobalter> QUnit 1.18.0 was released
[08:40:56] <arthurvr> really good news :)
[08:40:59] <arthurvr> hey everybody!
[08:41:20] <leobalter> now it's AMD friendly and we got a better diff handling
[08:41:31] <leobalter> .notOk was shipped as well
[08:41:49] <gibson042> woo
[08:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> I also got AMD support into grunt-contrib-qunit.
[08:42:33] <arthurvr> superb
[08:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> And have a PR for AMD in qunit-composite.
[08:43:43] <leobalter> we need a blog post about this AMD change
[08:44:09] <arthurvr> great idea, actually.
[08:45:08] <leobalter> we still got 10 open PRs created on the last 30 days
[08:46:52] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez: does grunt-qunit-istanbul use grunt-contrib-qunit or do we need to send a patch to this repo as well?
[08:47:06] * leobalter checking
[08:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> That was updated as well.
[08:47:52] <leobalter> yes: https://github.com/asciidisco/grunt-qunit-istanbul/commit/f7d1445861bab3c11db8acffa79f821927b2a701
[08:49:16] <jzaefferer> sorry, missed the start again
[08:49:26] <jzaefferer> leobalter: do you want to draft a blog post for the AMD change?
[08:50:21] <leobalter> I'm not sure I'll be able to write it this week, I'm hosting an event this Saturday
[08:51:14] <leobalter> I'll be able to write it on the next week, and to not miss it I can even schedule it.
[08:51:23] <jzaefferer> sounds good to me
[08:51:27] <leobalter> but I wouldn't block if someone else is interested
[08:52:50] <jzaefferer> I'm currently focusing on jQuery UI 1.12
[08:53:27] <jzaefferer> once GSoC starts for real, we should have plenty activity on QUnit again
[08:53:35] <leobalter> for QUnit I'm focused to work on the current commits, avoiding to create new ones (although I have some ideas)
[08:53:37] <jzaefferer> I'll review the remaining PRs inbetween
[08:53:48] <leobalter> current PRs*
[08:56:48] <leobalter> and for the 2.0 we need only to finish the nested modules and the stardard reporter interface
[08:57:22] <leobalter> the other issues are clean-up or not complex
[08:57:41] <jzaefferer> well, nested modules don't even need to be a breaking change (I hope)
[08:58:00] <jzaefferer> and we can add the new interface in a 1.x release as well
[08:59:19] <jzaefferer> btw. speaking of 1.18, I think the site and API docs updates all landed now
[08:59:23] <jzaefferer> There was one more PR that I merged today
[08:59:35] <jzaefferer> Need that on the release checklist..
[09:00:13] <leobalter> following the Ember release style, I believe we might try to make both a 1.x release and use 2.0 to ONLY commit feature removals or insert deprecation messages
[09:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> Running into UI meeting time.
[09:00:54] <arschmitz> GO AWAY!
[09:00:56] <arschmitz> :-p
[09:01:06] <leobalter> o/ have a good meeting. Bye
[09:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[09:01:23] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz jzaefferer fnagel mikesherov rxaviers rxaviers_ scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll tj_vantoll1
[09:01:30] <tj_vantoll> :waves:
[09:01:31] <rxaviers> Hi there!
[09:01:36] * rxaviers on standby
[09:01:46] <arthurvr> hey hey
[09:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Quick, land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1531 so we can adjust our counts ;-)
[09:02:23] <tj_vantoll> lol
[09:02:38] <tj_vantoll> I can land it if there are no other objections.
[09:02:53] <jzaefferer> leobalter: yeah, I think that's a good model
[09:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> Seemed like there was agreement, even from mikesherov, a few months ago.
[09:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer: Anything to discuss for button?
[09:04:05] <jzaefferer> ui-icon-widget-block
[09:04:16] <jzaefferer> ui-display-this-on-one-line
[09:04:21] <jzaefferer> blergh
[09:04:21] <arschmitz> lol
[09:04:37] <arschmitz> a class to add to an icon to make it centered on its own line
[09:05:46] <arschmitz> i think ui-widget-icon-block
[09:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> Is this applied to the element with ui-icon?
[09:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> Or is it applied a level up?
[09:06:31] <arschmitz> the elelemnt with ui-icon
[09:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> Does Mobile have anything like this?
[09:07:29] <arschmitz> no but we will any day now lol
[09:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> Does Bootstrap have anything like this?
[09:08:43] <arschmitz> nope
[09:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I hate naming, so...
[09:09:14] <arschmitz> it sets display:block; left:50% margin-left: -8px;
[09:09:23] <arschmitz> so basicly just puts it centered on its own line
[09:10:28] <arschmitz> ui-icon-centered?
[09:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> The naming is definitely tricky because ui-icon-* is generally an actual icon.
[09:12:15] <jzaefferer> so ui-widget-icon-block
[09:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> I assume Chassis isn't close to a point where this discussion can happen?
[09:13:01] <arschmitz> not really they are just about to start marking up buttons
[09:13:15] <arschmitz> and they will be doing bem so kinda different for this sort of thing
[09:13:43] <arschmitz> i did talk about the approach in general as far as how its done not naming and it was inline with sfrisks plans
[09:13:56] <sfrisk> wait, what?
[09:14:16] <arschmitz> a couple months ago when we talked about icons and making them inline
[09:14:19] <sfrisk> (catching up)
[09:14:25] <arschmitz> for buttons
[09:14:32] <sfrisk> ahhh, yes
[09:14:56] <arschmitz> obviously naming would not really carry over here though only aproach
[09:14:58] <sfrisk> Like in December or so?
[09:15:18] <arschmitz> probably i dont recall when ever i button switched to inline icons
[09:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'm fine with whatever name others choose :-)
[09:16:35] <arschmitz> ui-widget-icon-block still makes most sense to me it says its for an icon but not a ui-icon class
[09:17:11] <arschmitz> and the main function is to place on its own line via display:block for doing top and bottom icons so block makes sense to me
[09:18:04] <arschmitz> also does not seem like there is really another suggestion?
[09:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good to me.
[09:18:48] <arschmitz> done already changed lol
[09:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for button?
[09:20:27] <arschmitz> not off the top of my head most changes are overall trivial at this point
[09:20:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: you have anything else
[09:21:10] <arschmitz> a lot of adding comments
[09:22:25] <jzaefferer> I got nothing, its all in the PR
[09:22:51] <jzaefferer> I've continued work on classes docs today; can start with updates for button as well
[09:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> For AMD in tests, I've made a lot of progress.
[09:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> All tests have been updated, and the dependencies have all been updated, except for qunit-composite.
[09:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> Waiting for https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-composite/pull/16
[09:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's the last piece before this can be merged.
[09:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and arschmitz already did reviews.
[09:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you have anything for classes docs that needs to be discussed in here?
[09:25:38] <arschmitz> then comes splitting things up
[09:25:51] <jzaefferer> No, just need someone to confirm my list of default classes
[09:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> I emailed Dylan about the tooltip live region.
[09:26:23] <jzaefferer> Once my next round of updates is approved as well as that list, I can write the remaining docs
[09:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> He responded, so now I just need to continue that conversation.
[09:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> And that brings us to selectmenu max height.
[09:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer filed a PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1526
[09:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> But arschmitz raised some issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1526#issuecomment-88564398
[09:28:55] <arschmitz> yeah seems like at the very least we should add some sort of indicator that it can be scrolled
[09:29:16] <arschmitz> and on iOS its kinda broken
[09:30:39] <jzaefferer> is this any different from our max-height menu (demos)?
[09:30:52] <arschmitz> the brokenness?
[09:31:10] <arschmitz> or the look in general?
[09:31:25] <arschmitz> well neither are i guess they are both the same in current demos
[09:31:42] <arschmitz> but the difference is this is now going to be default behivor
[09:33:43] <jzaefferer> Is this our problem? Its not like we're actively hiding the scrollbar
[09:34:50] <arschmitz> i think it is
[09:35:13] <arschmitz> we are creating a scrollable container
[09:35:22] <arschmitz> with no indication that its scrollable
[09:35:35] <arschmitz> this seems like an accessibility issue to me
[09:36:04] <arschmitz> its one thing when it was soemthing the dev had to do in their own css
[09:36:13] <arschmitz> but now we are going to do this as part of the widget
[09:36:20] <jzaefferer> that applies to any element with a limited height and overflow:auto or scroll
[09:36:36] <arschmitz> yes but this is hiding options on a form control
[09:36:39] <arschmitz> thats a little different
[09:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> What if we add a class when the menu is scrollable?
[09:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> And we can have default styling that applies the down arrow icon at the bottom of the menu and adds some padding to prevent it from overlapping the last item?
[09:38:30] <arschmitz> to me i think we should follow what osx does and add a down arrow icon at the bottom
[09:38:36] <arschmitz> perfect
[09:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just do that with generated content?
[09:39:06] <arschmitz> i would think so
[09:39:14] <arschmitz> the whole menu is generated how would we not actually
[09:39:52] <arschmitz> also i think we should look into the iOS bug before this lands
[09:40:00] <arschmitz> since it makes that a real issue
[09:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> I meant CSS generated content.
[09:40:23] <arschmitz> oh
[09:40:44] <arschmitz> we dont do that anywhere else do we?
[09:40:51] <arschmitz> we also make an actual icon and add it
[09:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> I think we only use generated content for clearfix.
[09:41:57] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:42:23] <arschmitz> so i would say we should stay consistent
[09:42:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's see what that ends up looking like.
[09:42:47] <arschmitz> but it does make it more complicated
[09:42:51] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:43:41] <arschmitz> we will also need to wrap this in some logic that checks if its actually scrollable
[09:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's easy though.
[09:43:55] <arschmitz> dont want to show the icon if its not scrollable
[09:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty sure that logic already exists.
[09:43:59] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:44:40] <arschmitz> was just pointing out there is some logic involved now not just setting a css prop like in the pr
[09:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's why I suggested using CSS generated content ;-)
[09:45:10] <arschmitz> even then you need that logic
[09:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> Then the logic is just add a class if it's scrollable.
[09:45:22] <arschmitz> to determin if you need to add the class or not
[09:45:23] <arschmitz> yes
[09:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you want to work on that?
[09:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I can look into it.
[09:46:16] <jzaefferer> I'd like to finish the docs updates
[09:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:46:46] <jzaefferer> Can you comment on the original ticket with a summary?
[09:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:47:22] <jzaefferer> My PR itself isn't valuable
[09:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's just close that.
[09:49:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket updated: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11606
[09:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess that's all.
[09:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
[09:52:59] <arthurvr> bye everybody
