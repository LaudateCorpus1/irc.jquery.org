[14:04:00] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting time!
[14:04:22] <sfrisk> arschmitz, arthurvr_ geekman-rohit, kristyjy
[14:05:00] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:05:09] <sfrisk> Agenda:
[14:05:16] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:05:17] <kristyjy> hello all
[14:06:21] <sfrisk> So continuing last week's discussion about JSASS best practices
[14:06:51] <sfrisk> I have a PR that I submitted last night, of an example of best practices for button variables
[14:06:53] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/138/files
[14:07:20] <sfrisk> variables are grouped if they belong to the same thing
[14:07:34] <sfrisk> be in background/color
[14:07:50] <sfrisk> or the border, font size, line-height, padding that might be needed in various button sizes
[14:08:13] <sfrisk> I also tried to make the button variables a bit smaller than they were in previous iterations
[14:08:47] <sfrisk> to people like this approach? Is there anything you would rather see? I case I could think of is maybe introducing camel case or something
[14:11:03] <geekman-rohit> i think thats too many maps
[14:11:48] <geekman-rohit> maybe we should have maps say if border-size, border-color and all are together?
[14:12:28] <sfrisk> border stuff in this is border radius - that may differ for button sizes
[14:12:46] <geekman-rohit> yes so, ui-btn-border should be a map?
[14:12:53] <geekman-rohit> and ui-btn-xs-border
[14:13:14] <sfrisk> possibly - but btn color might be different based on the primary/success/info/etc state of the button
[14:13:17] <sfrisk> rather than button size
[14:13:31] <geekman-rohit> btn-color-xs
[14:13:35] <geekman-rohit> as one variable
[14:13:52] <geekman-rohit> i just think thats too many maps is all
[14:13:55] <sfrisk> but button colors are separate from button sizes
[14:14:05] <sfrisk> you could have a small green button, or a large green button
[14:14:06] <geekman-rohit> different variables then
[14:14:24] <geekman-rohit> btn-xs should not be a map is what i think
[14:14:30] <geekman-rohit> btn-xs-color as variable
[14:14:34] <geekman-rohit> btn-xs-border as map
[14:14:44] <sfrisk> which is why I kept things that affected colors of buttons apart from things that controlled size
[14:14:53] <geekman-rohit> btn-xs-color may be map, if in we have bgcolor and fgcolor, say
[14:15:18] <geekman-rohit> umm
[14:15:42] <geekman-rohit> everything is a map here
[14:15:52] <geekman-rohit> it just seems odd to me
[14:16:29] <sfrisk> Initial pass on the last button thing looked something like this: http://view.css-chassis.com/96-basic-buttons/scss/variables/buttons.js
[14:17:02] <sfrisk> which definitely spread out variables a bit more and had less maps
[14:17:17] <sfrisk> I think generic button stuff could possibly not need it's own map
[14:17:28] <sfrisk> such as font-weight, margin, text-transform
[14:18:02] <sfrisk> stuff that isn't necessarily going to get passed into a mixin to be like "Here, I want a primary button. print out the necessary colors for it"
[14:18:18] <geekman-rohit> yes
[14:18:49] <geekman-rohit> i think we should have maps for related fields, like border, colors(foreground, background), font(style,size, etc)
[14:18:58] <geekman-rohit> so btn-xs-font is a map
[14:19:13] <sfrisk> and btn-xs-padding is a map?
[14:19:13] <geekman-rohit> with style, size , decoration etc. inside it
[14:19:21] <sfrisk> and btn-xs-radius is another variable?
[14:19:23] <geekman-rohit> if its just one  value, no
[14:19:32] <geekman-rohit> btn-xs-border can have radius inside
[14:19:37] <geekman-rohit> its border-radius after all
[14:19:58] <sfrisk> but border color might be separate from the button size
[14:20:09] <geekman-rohit> yes so we have 4 maps
[14:20:12] <geekman-rohit> btn-xs-border
[14:20:18] <geekman-rohit> btn-lg-border
[14:20:33] <geekman-rohit> each definig border type/size/radius for different type of buttons
[14:20:57] <sfrisk> then have a separate map for the font sizes for each button?
[14:21:06] <geekman-rohit> if it is different
[14:21:14] <sfrisk> my case against that is it could complicate things on the SASS side of things
[14:21:14] <geekman-rohit> or we have font size only on btn class
[14:22:04] <geekman-rohit> my case is that varibales should be grouped into maps if they refer to same style type like text, border, colors
[14:22:10] <sfrisk> @mixin ui-button-sizes($size) {
[14:22:10] <sfrisk> 	border-radius: map-get( $size, border-radius );
[14:22:10] <sfrisk> 	font-size: map-get( $size, font-size );
[14:22:12] <sfrisk> 	line-height: map-get( $size, line-height );
[14:22:14] <sfrisk> 	padding: map-get( $size, padding );
[14:22:16] <sfrisk> }
[14:22:28] <sfrisk> that printed ugly
[14:22:30] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/blob/96-basic-buttons/scss/atoms/buttons/_mixins.scss
[14:23:09] <geekman-rohit> hmm its just my opinion
[14:23:22] <geekman-rohit> im fine with this way too
[14:23:24] <sfrisk> The advantage for one mixin that covers the various aspects of a button size, is you only need to call one mixin, rather than calling several
[14:23:32] <geekman-rohit> yes agreed
[14:23:37] <sfrisk> Oh, your idea definitely has merit, I think discussion is important
[14:24:07] <sfrisk> otherwise, development in a vacuum, which doesn't help at all
[14:24:42] <geekman-rohit> what does everyone else think?
[14:24:48] <geekman-rohit> @arschmitz?
[14:25:10] <geekman-rohit> we should go for whatever most people think is best
[14:25:52] <sfrisk> I put a comment on the PR to try and open up that discussion
[14:26:07] <geekman-rohit> yay
[14:26:20] <geekman-rohit> http://codepen.io/geekman-rohit/pen/qOGKMK
[14:26:34] <geekman-rohit> i am trying to make progress more.. material design oriented
[14:26:35] <sfrisk> I want to have this discussion, because if we want more contributors, I think we need a clear guide of HOW to use JSASS
[14:26:38] <geekman-rohit> they look better thinner
[14:27:03] <geekman-rohit> any major css projects that use sass 3.3+ ?
[14:27:16] <geekman-rohit> we could look in when most people use maps
[14:27:17] <sfrisk> haven't looked at the code too close (just visuals), but having the option to use either a thin or thick bar might be good
[14:27:34] <geekman-rohit> code is a mess
[14:27:41] <geekman-rohit> ill put up 2 more options this week
[14:27:51] <geekman-rohit> much free time in officen ow
[14:27:53] <geekman-rohit> now*
[14:28:03] <sfrisk> yay, free time!
[14:28:08] <geekman-rohit> i like them thinner though
[14:28:09] <sfrisk> (what is that?)
[14:28:27] <geekman-rohit> that is when the release this month does not include the module you are working on
[14:28:30] <geekman-rohit> :D
[14:28:51] <sfrisk> lol
[14:29:03] <sfrisk> I've been neck deep in iphone app development
[14:29:31] <geekman-rohit> ive been working on moving our php app to hhvm
[14:29:36] <geekman-rohit> nowhere close i be as of now
[14:29:39] <geekman-rohit> :(
[14:29:49] <geekman-rohit> but i got till jan first week for that, so no worries
[14:30:06] <sfrisk> fun times
[14:30:58] <sfrisk> okay, so I think the takeaway from the discussion is I'll do some research, see what I can find about variables vs maps in SASS and what general opinions are
[14:31:24] <sfrisk> I know when I did the initial pass on buttons, there were questions about why I didn't map things to simplify things - but it's entirely possible I could have gone too far
[14:32:00] <kristyjy> lol for real what is this free time you speak of? But yeah I agree with geekman-hohit about the maps :)
[14:34:23] <geekman-rohit> ill also find time to put up some examples about what I think should be the way
[14:34:30] <sfrisk> which is totally fine, we could decrease the size of the maps - I'm just trying to make sure it balances out on the sass end
[14:34:32] <sfrisk> awesome
[14:34:43] <geekman-rohit> i should have free time tomorrow between vm installations to try hhvm
[14:34:50] <sfrisk> okay
[14:35:08] <sfrisk> I may have free time this weekend, although part of me is super tempted on Friday to set up all the Christmas decorations in my apartment
[14:35:18] <geekman-rohit> also ill be attending next week too, ill have 2 themes for meter, material and flat
[14:35:29] <sfrisk> ok
[14:35:36] <geekman-rohit> we can then have a vote !
[14:36:05] <geekman-rohit> we should also have a set of color palette maps somewhere
[14:36:05] <geekman-rohit> ?
[14:36:22] <sfrisk> Yeah, I think those early files need to get redone a bit
[14:36:26] <geekman-rohit> $Blue(light: , dark: ) ?
[14:36:29] <geekman-rohit> something like that
[14:36:56] <geekman-rohit> and then a theme map that uses these colors
[14:37:10] <geekman-rohit> so modifying colors becomes super easy for user
[14:37:12] <sfrisk> yeah, I definitely think we should organize the colors bit
[14:37:15] <sfrisk> a bit*
[14:37:17] <geekman-rohit> they just chnage one map
[14:37:33] <sfrisk> so if it's a major pallet color, just refer to that, instead of the HEX/RGBA
[14:37:40] <geekman-rohit> yes!!
[14:37:50] <geekman-rohit> preferably most colors should come from palettes
[14:37:56] <sfrisk> also it might be good to have the HEX and RGB of major colors, if opacity becomes important
[14:38:16] <sfrisk> also have the color pallet flexible enough to add more colors as needed
[14:38:33] <geekman-rohit> so we have a map that goes something like
[14:38:48] <geekman-rohit> $Red(100: 200:#code 300:#code )
[14:38:58] <geekman-rohit> or light, super-light, dark instead of numbers
[14:39:31] <geekman-rohit> i got that idea from material design palettes when i was looking into it for progress examples
[14:39:40] <sfrisk> we definitely should figure it out. Because I know beyond figuring out if something is a light or dark, I sorta suck at guessing what color a HEX color is
[14:40:02] <geekman-rohit> https://www.google.co.in/design/spec/style/color.html
[14:40:14] <geekman-rohit> i suck at that too
[14:40:14] <sfrisk> to echo earlier discussions, be careful about referring to colors in the pallet
[14:40:53] <geekman-rohit> i kinda stole those palettes for our app at work :D
[14:41:24] <geekman-rohit> talking of colors
[14:41:30] <geekman-rohit> was accessibility pr merged?
[14:41:33] <sfrisk> because if someone decides they want to change all the colors that were previously purple to blue - to have the variable referred to as "$purple" might be awkward
[14:41:35] <geekman-rohit> we need that before colors
[14:41:40] <sfrisk> I don't think so
[14:41:48] <sfrisk> I think there was something we were waiting on from arschmitz?
[14:41:56] <geekman-rohit> no they simply say
[14:42:14] <geekman-rohit> $primary-palette: $Blue
[14:42:22] <geekman-rohit> $secondary-palette: $Red
[14:42:32] <geekman-rohit> we then use $primary, $secondary in theme maps
[14:42:34] <sfrisk> that works
[14:42:44] <geekman-rohit> so if someone wants to change, they change these variables
[14:43:01] <sfrisk> ok, that works then
[14:43:38] <geekman-rohit> ohkay i should have some sleep
[14:43:41] <geekman-rohit> work early tomorrow
[14:43:43] <geekman-rohit> :(
[14:43:44] <sfrisk> I think we should also decide on final colors, that are readable, I don't know if we want to bring a designer in for that. Or just for this initial first pass grab colors from bootstrap or material
[14:43:45] <sfrisk> okay
[14:43:49] <sfrisk> thanks for staying up late!
[14:43:56] <geekman-rohit> issacdurazo might help?
[14:44:28] <geekman-rohit> I am tired of work at office, some open source talk is refreshing!!
[14:44:48] <sfrisk> definitely worth reaching out perhaps, I think if we have some basic designs out there and be like "we need color advice" could be useful
[14:44:59] <sfrisk> open source talk is fun :-D
[14:45:01] <geekman-rohit> buttons and progress
[14:45:08] <geekman-rohit> lets decide a deadline internally for both
[14:45:09] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:45:24] <sfrisk> So if we can decide on variable conventions by next week
[14:45:39] <sfrisk> then I might make a deadline for buttons of 2 weeks after that
[14:45:57] <geekman-rohit> why dont you make a sheet for that? proposed timeline for us all?
[14:46:04] <sfrisk> Okay
[14:46:33] <sfrisk> I can have that ready for everyone by next week
[14:46:43] <geekman-rohit> sounds great!!
[14:46:52] <geekman-rohit> also think of Gsoc this year
[14:46:57] <geekman-rohit> we get a lot of crowd
[14:47:08] <geekman-rohit> small tasks will be done fast during this time of year
[14:47:13] <sfrisk> kristyjy, do you have bandwidth for anything right now? I can't remember if we owed you stuff for the SASS style guide or not
[14:47:29] <sfrisk> or if there is something you would like to work on
[14:47:36] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:47:47] <geekman-rohit> we will have some young college guys, we could use some help right now
[14:47:52] <sfrisk> if we do GSOC next year, I would like to have "phase one" goal of last year done before then
[14:48:06] <sfrisk> err last summer I guess
[14:48:13] <sfrisk> just life happened and things got crazy
[14:48:14] <kristyjy> sense we have a long weekend I may have some time to finish up some edits for the style guide
[14:48:26] <kristyjy> *crosses fingers*
[14:48:36] <sfrisk> I can always text you and bug you ;-)
[14:48:45] <kristyjy> you can lol
[14:48:58] <kristyjy> reminding me doesn't hurt
[14:49:04] <sfrisk> And then my greatest fear will be realized, I will have become a project manager
[14:49:10] <kristyjy> LOL
[14:49:31] <kristyjy> project lead.. PM.. pretty similar because we have no PM
[14:49:45] <sfrisk> Okay, so I wrote down some action items on the agenda for next weeek
[14:50:18] <sfrisk> Also I need to add to the JSCS PR to include tabbing checking
[14:50:29] <sfrisk> since that was removed from the jQuery preset
[14:50:42] <sfrisk> I'll try to have that PR updated before thursday
[14:50:56] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:51:18] <sfrisk> Okay
[14:51:28] <sfrisk> well good meeting everyone, see you on github and css-chassis!
