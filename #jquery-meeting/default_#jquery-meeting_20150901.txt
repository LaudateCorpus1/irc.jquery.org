[10:01:15] <sfrisk> this meeting might be a quick one, partly because I'm kinda on vacation right now, and didn't get a chance to get to a whole lot this week, and I don't think anyone else did either
[10:01:39] <sfrisk> How are localized downloads coming, geekman-rohit?
[10:02:18] <geekman-rohit> almost done, ill review it again and update in a day or two
[10:02:36] <geekman-rohit> i was like caught up in moving and stuff, finally settled and free again
[10:03:37] <arthurvr> hey everybody
[10:03:38] <sfrisk> understandable
[10:04:13] <sfrisk> I haven't redone buttons yet, I'll be doing that this week
[10:04:20] <geekman-rohit> and me meter
[10:04:26] <sfrisk> huzzuh for birthdays

[10:04:38] <sfrisk> yup

[10:05:11] <geekman-rohit> Happy Birthday!
[10:05:15] <arthurvr> Mine’s today too :)
[10:05:22] <sfrisk> :-D
[10:05:23] <arthurvr> Happy birthday!
[10:05:30] <sfrisk> Happy birthday!
[10:05:38] <geekman-rohit> Happy Birthday arthurvr!
[10:05:52] <sfrisk> Okay, so birthday party in chassis meeting today
[10:06:10] <geekman-rohit> someone send for a pizza
[10:06:15] <sfrisk> mmm, pizza
[10:06:25] <sfrisk> my family is coming up to visit, I think they're taking me out of lobster rolls
[10:06:35] <arthurvr> Ha, I actually just ordered a pizza fyi
[10:07:35] <sfrisk> Okay, so table styling needs to be taken over, but that can wait until after buttons/meter and the class naming has been finalized
[10:07:56] <sfrisk> I don't think kristyjy has had any more work done on the style guide, but I'll go bug her
[10:08:09] <sfrisk> arthurvr, how goes chassis support for node 0.12?
[10:09:08] <geekman-rohit> class naming? i think we decided that right?
[10:09:14] <geekman-rohit> be m m m
[10:10:00] <arthurvr> sfrisk: in fact I think we do support 0.12 (at least partially)
[10:10:09] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:10:15] <sfrisk> that was aaaaalll of last meeting
[10:10:18] <sfrisk> Option #3
[10:10:35] <sfrisk> Oh, okay, I think I have bugs when node runs on a newer version on my local enviroment
[10:10:36] <arthurvr> didn’t have time to look into it much, will do this week. I think we do support it except that node-sass landed some (tiny) fixes we don’t have yet
[10:10:53] <sfrisk> sounds good, don't work today though
[10:10:56] <sfrisk> it's your birthday
[10:11:07] <sfrisk> and if I can be a lazy bum on my birthday, so can you
[10:11:17] <arthurvr> sfrisk: can you send me some logs just so I can look into it? Normally the actual build system should work.
[10:11:45] <geekman-rohit> it worked on 0.12 for me
[10:11:51] <sfrisk> then maybe I'm going crazy
[10:11:51] <geekman-rohit> ill try again though
[10:11:59] <sfrisk> which is a possibility
[10:12:04] <sfrisk> or the issue has been fixed
[10:12:16] <arthurvr> yeah ^ that’s possible
[10:12:18] <geekman-rohit> or it was something specific to your installation
[10:12:27] <arthurvr> but just send me some logs
[10:13:10] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:13:21] <sfrisk> I'll see if I can reproduce the issue and send it to you
[10:13:37] <arthurvr> alright
[10:13:51] <sfrisk> okay so if someone wants to take add jsass vars to typography, that's open too
[10:13:58] <sfrisk> I could possibly grab that and work on it this week
[10:14:19] <sfrisk> Also I have two PRs I need to pull in. which is fixing the jscs lint errors in task files, and the [hidden]
[10:15:23] <sfrisk> and that's it on my list for today
[10:15:49] <sfrisk> anyone have anything else?
[10:16:39] <geekman-rohit> I dont think so
[10:17:04] <sfrisk> okay then
[10:17:05] <arthurvr> not for me at least
[10:17:08] <sfrisk> see you guys next week!
[10:17:16] <arthurvr> have a nice birthday :)
[10:17:24] <sfrisk> thanks! you too!
