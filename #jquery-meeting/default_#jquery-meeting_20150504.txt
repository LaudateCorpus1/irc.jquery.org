[09:00:55] <timmywil> m_gol, gibson042, markelog, DaveMethvin|away, arthurvr meeting time!
[09:01:04] <arthurvr> hey hey
[09:01:22] <timmywil> My computer died and I'm on crappy gogo wifi on my phone. 
[09:03:01] <timmywil> First, we got the patches released! Thanks all
[09:03:52] <timmywil> Also, I landed some data changes. I may have been too quick on the draw and I should have done a PR.
[09:04:25] <timmywil> But please have a look at those changes. They seemed simple enough at the time, but maybe I missed something.
[09:04:51] <timmywil> I can't pull up the agenda. Could someone take notes?
[09:05:16] <timmywil> The first item is also the biggest one. The PR on using native xhr.
[09:06:21] <timmywil> At this moment, I'm inclined to agree that we should not add the online dependency. However, I'd like to still test it somehow.
[09:07:10] <timmywil> If we need to add the integration tests, I propose we add them in a way that is completely separate from our unit tests.
[09:07:36] <timmywil> e.g. another teat page or something
[09:08:11] <timmywil> Someone say something so I know this phone is working. :)
[09:08:26] <arthurvr> heyyyy it works :D
[09:08:38] <timmywil> Cool!
[09:08:56] <arthurvr> I think we’re quite alone though. Anybody else here?
[09:09:13] <markelog> timmywil: did you summoned everyone?
[09:09:27] <timmywil> i did
[09:09:29] <markelog> i might have missed the "call" )
[09:09:37] <timmywil> It may not have gone through
[09:09:45] <arthurvr> it did
[09:10:00] <markelog> timmywil: i'd say we could even introduce real selenium tests
[09:10:19] <markelog> so we could correctly check the events stuff, for example
[09:10:42] <markelog> those focus tests and creation of our events is a burden
[09:10:52] <timmywil> yea that's probably a good idea. Something that should have been done a long time ago, I'd say.
[09:11:12] <markelog> we can create an issue for it
[09:11:23] <timmywil> Although, it's gotten much easier more recently
[09:11:33] <timmywil> yea, please do
[09:11:35] <markelog> yeah, browserstack saucelabs
[09:11:38] <markelog> karma launcher
[09:11:42] <markelog> much easier
[09:11:50] <markelog> not always stable though (
[09:12:00] <arthurvr> yup ^ though I think we should do it
[09:12:05] <gibson042> sorry I'm late; still splitting my attention a little bit
[09:12:09] <markelog> maybe ppl from other teams would want that too
[09:12:14] <arthurvr> hey gibson042
[09:12:15] <timmywil> but for now, are you ok with landing the patch test separate from unit tests?
[09:12:25] <markelog> timmywil: yep
[09:12:57] <timmywil> I really don't want to mix integration and unit tests, but I think we still could use the test.
[09:13:17] <m_gol> present
[09:13:29] <markelog> timmywil: speaking strictly, in many ways we already are
[09:13:36] <timmywil> gibson042: markelog I can't pull up the doc. Could one of you take notes!
[09:13:39] <timmywil> ?
[09:13:42] <markelog> but that happens a lot in js world though
[09:13:53] <markelog> sec
[09:14:17] <timmywil> that wasn't supposed to be an exclamation :)
[09:14:38] <markelog> okay opened
[09:15:31] <timmywil> need to mark who's present, that we'll create issue for integration testing, and will land the native xhr PR, but with the test separated.
[09:15:55] <markelog> marked
[09:16:03] <timmywil> thanks!
[09:16:07] <timmywil> what was next?
[09:16:17] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2254
[09:16:40] <markelog> weird, but these things happens
[09:16:59] <timmywil> ah yea, that one seems like a clear one to land
[09:17:13] <timmywil> stuff happens
[09:17:31] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2243
[09:17:34] <markelog> next one
[09:18:17] <markelog> seems we can land this one
[09:18:21] <timmywil> gibson042: is anything blocking your css cascade pr? I'm all for it
[09:18:43] <timmywil> markelog: yea, I think that one can land too
[09:19:04] <markelog> will land 2254 and 2255
[09:19:36] <markelog> sorry, that supposed to be 2254 and 2243
[09:19:45] <timmywil> gotcha, thanks

[09:22:01] <timmywil> We'll keep this one short. It looks like more than just me is juggling more than one thing at a time.
[09:22:15] <timmywil> markelog: that would be great
[09:22:24] <timmywil> and I'll work on landing that offest pr
[09:22:35] <timmywil> and moving on to other issues
[09:22:54] <markelog> timmywil: okay, it seems we can continue discussions at the github
[09:23:01] <markelog> timmywil: are you on the plane?
[09:23:01] <timmywil> I think we're actually seeing beta take shape!

[09:23:12] <timmywil> yea, lol
[09:23:20] <markelog> timmywil: cool!

[09:23:30] <markelog> and connection was pretty bad
