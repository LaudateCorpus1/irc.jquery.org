[09:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: kborchers mikesherov ngsilverman petersendidit rxaviers
[09:00:46] <rxaviers> hello
[09:00:48] <gnarf> hey!
[09:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf!
[09:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's been a while :-)
[09:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it'll be a short meeting.
[09:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Any update for download builder?
[09:03:03] <mikesherov> woah
[09:03:04] <mikesherov> special guest referee gnarf
[09:03:12] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:03:18] <rxaviers> Im still working on cutting off the release duplicate code between jQuery UI and DownloadBuilder. Although still working, I hope I have a PR today with the change summaries.
[09:03:25] <rxaviers> In order to let jQuery UI generate the release by using DownloadBuilder (low level building-blocks), I first needed to do some changes on DownloadBuilder. 1st, drop off its dependency on having a release-prepared-jquery-ui files. Yeap, part of the prepare process was running `grunt release`. Dropped, and now it prepare the files with `grunt built`.
[09:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:04:54] <rxaviers> (thinking loud, when writing the above I had two points.. But I forgot the 2nd aff)
[09:05:06] <rxaviers> ah
[09:05:15] <tj_vantoll> Hey everyone.  Running a little late today.
[09:05:22] <rxaviers> 2nd, change main DB interface to expose those low level building-blocks
[09:05:52] <rxaviers> I have almost everything done and I've tested before and after changes to make sure we still build the same things
[09:06:06] <rxaviers> I'm finding out some old bugs actually.
[09:06:11] <rxaviers> Im fixing those as well
[09:06:15] <petersendidit> hey
[09:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> Hooray for fixed bugs.
[09:06:35] <rxaviers> :)
[09:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of which, our ticket count is still dropping.
[09:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Down to 335.
[09:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> with 4 pending
[09:07:26] <mikesherov> :-)
[09:07:30] <scott_gonzalez> You may have noticed that I started reviewing datepicker tickets today.
[09:07:49] <mikesherov> I did notice!
[09:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> Someone filed a ticket and I was checking for a dupe and noticed that we still have a big pile...
[09:08:02] <tj_vantoll> I see that my inbox has quite a few messages :)
[09:08:04] <rxaviers> One thing in advance: for the `release` task, we could virtually use DB only. Although, for the `release_cdn` task, DB doesnt help much.. But, will cover that in more details in the PR.
[09:08:32] <mikesherov> LOL
[09:09:10] <rxaviers> (hooray about the ticket droppings :-) )
[09:09:20] <rxaviers> ah scott
[09:09:23] <rxaviers> one question
[09:09:35] <rxaviers> now, DB is generating demos/index.html dynamically based on component selection
[09:09:55] <rxaviers> it uses a template on DB to do so
[09:10:07] <rxaviers> so, whenever we update `demos/index.html` on jQuery UI, we need to update that DB template as well.
[09:10:14] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: we still need to discuss my open pull, and we need to discuss ultcombo's button stuff
[09:10:47] <rxaviers> What's the best way to place a trigger on that? Shall we add a comment on jquery-ui/demos/index.html mentioning that? SHall we observe that file some other way?
[09:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sure, we just won't udpate it.
[09:11:22] <rxaviers> if we dont update it on DB as well, we'll have wrong release packages
[09:11:37] <rxaviers> and wrong download packages
[09:11:55] <rxaviers> we just need to make sure they are in sync
[09:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> Why? As long as it's built from the list of subdirectories, it'll always be correct.
[09:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter what's in the jquery-ui repo, really.
[09:12:11] <rxaviers> nope, I dont mean that.
[09:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> The page only exists to guarantee you get a listing even if the server has directory listings disabled.
[09:12:34] <rxaviers> I mean: if index.html is changed (say we style it differently), we wont get those changes on DB
[09:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer if the file didn't even exist.
[09:12:46] <rxaviers> If we never change that index.html, so we'll have no trouble
[09:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> But it does, and people get mad when it doesn't.
[09:13:34] <rxaviers> see what I mean?
[09:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> I don't.
[09:13:53] <gnarf> leave a note in the directory that it is generated for each build, and this is the development version of it?
[09:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter what the page looks like.
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> All that matters is that it exists.
[09:14:06] <gnarf> er sorry, in the html
[09:14:20] <fnagel> sorry, I'm late
[09:14:53] <rxaviers> we have a file `demos/index.html`.. It's very simple and all it does is to list the demos subdirs. Ok.
[09:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> A comment in the HTML is fine.
[09:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's necessary, but I certainly won't object to it.
[09:15:19] <rxaviers> DB is smart enough to only show user the subdirs he has picked (by generating the LI list dynamically)
[09:15:31] <rxaviers> ok with that.
[09:16:02] <rxaviers> what I mean is: if we make a change on the index.html layout, that won't get reflected on DB automatically
[09:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> Right, it doesn't matter.
[09:16:16] <rxaviers> ok then
[09:16:34] <rxaviers> So, premise: demos/index.html will never have its layout changed
[09:16:35] <rxaviers> :)
[09:16:42] <rxaviers> or if it does, it doesnt matter
[09:16:59] <rxaviers> So, that's it from my side... Hopefully opening a PR today with all that
[09:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll did some investigation to see which features of the classes option would be solved by future CSS.
[09:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/65050459/Classes%20Option
[09:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately the answer is "not enough"
[09:19:09] <tj_vantoll> Yeah.  I think if we want the features the classes option is going for JS is the way to go.
[09:19:32] <petersendidit> Yea after reading your stuff I am thinking the same thing
[09:19:49] <tj_vantoll> I did want to talk to the mobile guys though.  scott_gonzalez You said they had chatted about this, was that in IRC?
[09:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe. I saw the notes in jquery-devs-team.
[09:20:59] <scott_gonzalez> Subject was "http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/65050459/Classes%20Option"
[09:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, I hate when copying doesn't work.
[09:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> "jQuery Mobile theming team planning"
[09:22:38] <tj_vantoll> Found it.  Alright I'll read that over and chat with them.
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:24:13] <scott_gonzalez> I still need finish reviewing interactions.
[09:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> I need to just pick a day and only work on interactions.
[09:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> No site work, no tooling, nothing but interactions.
[09:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll actually finish it :-P
[09:27:03] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> So: interactions review, selectmenu review, 1.10.3, 1.9.3, datepicker API design, 1.11.0
[09:27:31] <mikesherov> besides, I added a whole bunch of tests to draggable that need to get integrated
[09:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> Should I just wait for that?
[09:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> And just look at ngsilverman's stuff for now?
[09:28:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: not sure
[09:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, one thing that needs to happen for draggable is splitting the deprecated tests into a separate file.
[09:28:51] <mikesherov> but I've fixed like 6 ui bugs
[09:29:09] <mikesherov> in draggable that are real
[09:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> in master, right?
[09:29:17] <mikesherov> just need to make sure the rewrite passes them
[09:29:21] <mikesherov> yeah, in master
[09:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> right
[09:29:27] <mikesherov> including one a few seconds ago
[09:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> We can wait to move the deprecated tests until we feel that the master test suite is "complete"
[09:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> So that it's easier to compare the two.
[09:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, tj_vantoll don't leave comments for wiki edits.
[09:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> pbwiki is really annoying and if you leave a comment, it doesn't send a diff.
[09:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> So you think "Oh, I'll leave a message so the history is useful." and then the notifications become worthless.
[09:31:12] <tj_vantoll> Wow that's crazy, but ok.
[09:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:33:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: when might we be able to use a github wiki?
[09:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We're just going to create a new WordPress site.
[09:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub wiki won't allow use of iframes or scripts.
[09:33:38] <fnagel> What about Selectmenu?
[09:33:56] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: I'm going to do a review after interactions.
[09:35:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems good
[09:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> The site will deploy on every commit.
[09:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> So if you want to treat it like a wiki, just use the GitHub editing UI.
[09:38:27] <fnagel> Ok, I really hope we release Selectmenu soon. My first commit is older than two years...
[09:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> I realize it's taking a long time.
[09:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> But our big focus is on cleanup right now, so everything takes a long time.
[09:41:23] <scott_gonzalez> It won't be until 2.0 that our new dev pace will really pick up.
[09:42:25] <fnagel> I really hope so... if there's anything I can do, just drop me line
[09:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> Will do. I'll let you know as soon as I get to the review.
[09:44:33] <fnagel> Nice!
[09:48:59] <mikesherov> .
[09:49:46] <mikesherov> so, I wanting to bring up a few things, now a good time?
[09:50:03] <gnarf> seems like it
[09:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:50:34] <mikesherov> OK, so effects rewrite
[09:51:04] <mikesherov> petro and I did a review and figured out what expected behavior for all effects are, and fixed almost all the changes scott_gonzalez requested two weeks ago
[09:51:17] <mikesherov> still writing tests, but I'd like gnarf to look at it too
[09:51:21] <mikesherov> will you have time?
[09:51:30] <mikesherov> it's on my clip branch
[09:52:09] <gnarf> i can probably do that this week
[09:52:25] <gnarf> it's not a pull yet?
[09:52:38] <gnarf> might be an easier place to conduct a review?
[09:52:40] <mikesherov> not yet a pull
[09:52:48] <mikesherov> ok, I'll open one shortly
[09:53:52] <mikesherov> thanks gnarf
[09:54:04] <mikesherov> next I wanted to discuss the button fixes from UltCombo
[09:54:12] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: will you have time to look into it?
[09:54:28] <mikesherov> I can review, but I don't know the ins and outs of focus and checked state stuff
[09:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can look at it.
[09:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> But the last time I looked it was a ton of code.
[09:54:46] <mikesherov> it is a lot of code
[09:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..how much of this is just code that moved around?
[09:55:25] <mikesherov> I don't know, I didn't look closely yet
[09:55:36] <mikesherov> try ?w=1
[09:56:05] <mikesherov> just calling it out
[09:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll take a look.
[09:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> At  least it has tests.
[09:56:32] <mikesherov> yup, but some of it is untestable with sumlate
[09:56:35] <mikesherov> simulate
[09:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> It'll probably take some time just reading through the full discussion again.
[09:56:48] <mikesherov> can't simulate a real IE mouse click on a checkbox :-\
[09:57:00] <scott_gonzalez> WEB DRIVER!
[09:57:31] <mikesherov> selenium for that
[09:57:31] <mikesherov> yes
[09:57:35] <mikesherov> one DAY
[09:57:39] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of tests, I should probably mention here that I volunteered us to write some tests for the Pointer Events spec.
[09:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, dev leads meeting is starting in a minute.
[09:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> Let's continue any discussion in -dev.
[09:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
