[14:01:31] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting party!
[14:02:01] <sfrisk> (although I am in the middle of a work meeting right now so I might be a little spotty in responding for the first ten minutes)
[14:02:10] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman_rohit_, kristyjy
[14:02:25] <thej> Hey !
[14:02:51] <kristyjy> hi
[14:03:07] <geekman-rohit> hey people
[14:03:27] <sfrisk> Also everyone meet thej, who has been hanging out in #css-chassis lately and has been commenting on some issues
[14:03:38] <sfrisk> brought up the good point we don't have typography styling for <p>
[14:04:00] <kristyjy> ahh cool nice to meet you :)
[14:04:19] <sfrisk> thej, you're a google summer of code hopeful, right?
[14:04:21] <thej> very nice to meet all of you :)
[14:04:23] <kristyjy> sorry if I'm a bit quiet today. Got a huge deadline to meet today
[14:04:39] <thej> sfrisk yes
[14:05:10] <thej> sfrisk looking at a longer contribution rather than just gsoc
[14:05:43] <geekman-rohit> thats great @thej
[14:05:59] <sfrisk> Well we love having contributors!
[14:06:04] <kristyjy> glad to hear it we really need the help! :)
[14:06:44] <thej> sfrisk geekman-rohit kristyjy will give in my best :)
[14:07:46] <geekman-rohit> @sfrisk the agenda?
[14:08:02] <sfrisk> sorry, meeting haven't had a chance, one sec
[14:09:08] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:10:00] <sfrisk> so geekman-rohit has made some updates to typography
[14:10:12] <sfrisk> I think the updated variable pass looked good
[14:10:23] <geekman-rohit> and thej has pointed out some good suggestions
[14:10:32] <sfrisk> but thej made a good point that there were some typography styling that we did have
[14:10:41] <sfrisk> <ol> <li> <ul> isn't there either
[14:11:33] <thej> sfrisk I can help out there, work out the rest with geekman-rohit if its ok
[14:12:03] <geekman-rohit> i think marestad wanted things to be simple and basic back then
[14:12:26] <geekman-rohit> while ol, li, ul is a fair point , im not much into styling paragraphs
[14:12:26] <geekman-rohit> but there has to be atleast a style for margins and paddings for a paragraph I guess
[14:12:39] <sfrisk> but it would be nice to have some basic paragraph, li, ol, ul styling that could be variable controlled
[14:12:47] <sfrisk> like list style
[14:12:55] <geekman-rohit> leaving them to default by default, but variables all the same so easy to modify
[14:13:22] <geekman-rohit> sure thej
[14:13:52] <geekman-rohit> if you have any ideas for any style, you can do a PR on my repo, or simply commit in urs and ill pull it in
[14:14:28] <thej> geekman-rohit sure, will do that
[14:15:01] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk you wanna wait till that is done or pull in sooner?
[14:15:21] <sfrisk> well, your issue was the "add variables to existing typography"
[14:15:25] <geekman-rohit> this pr was meant to use more variables and mixins and not modify styles
[14:15:32] <sfrisk> so minus the fact that we don't have the p, li, ol, etc styles
[14:15:46] <geekman-rohit> i still have one small thing to commit
[14:15:49] <sfrisk> I think we could pull in what you have, then thej could do a pull request on what is in master
[14:15:53] <sfrisk> ahhh, okay
[14:16:00] <sfrisk> what are you adding?
[14:16:09] <geekman-rohit> just using the palette
[14:16:13] <geekman-rohit> shades on hover/focus
[14:16:27] <sfrisk> ah, okay
[14:17:05] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/141
[14:17:43] <geekman-rohit> do we have any decision about that?
[14:18:06] <sfrisk> no we really haven't talked about it minus the brief "this looks weird depending on what browser you're on for th ebuttons"
[14:18:12] <sfrisk> I think we should make a decision on it tho
[14:18:22] <geekman-rohit> I donot like modifying some basic browser styling, I like my css to add to that and not replace it
[14:18:33] <geekman-rohit> but we could have variables
[14:18:45] <geekman-rohit> the default theme could leave it as it is
[14:19:11] <sfrisk> I mean we could style the outline css element
[14:19:22] <sfrisk> to at least have the same feature
[14:19:28] <sfrisk> style*
[14:19:30] <sfrisk> Style the outline. Webkit browsers have a more prominent glow so you could try styling it to make it less obtrusive. Consider the use of a:focus { outline: thin dotted; } to normalize the look of the outline across browsers.
[14:19:39] <sfrisk> (taken from http://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/)
[14:20:26] <geekman-rohit> as long as we dont have a outline:none
[14:20:28] <thej> would help having a consistent design across browsers
[14:20:28] <geekman-rohit> im happy
[14:20:50] <geekman-rohit> no arschmitz today?
[14:21:06] <geekman-rohit> Im sure he would have something to say in this
[14:21:22] <geekman-rohit> wow i have never seen him not on irc
[14:22:24] <geekman-rohit> meh, sfrisk gone
[14:22:46] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy , We need some sort of standard to define variables
[14:22:53] <geekman-rohit> hyphenated or camelcased
[14:23:14] <sfrisk> (sorry)
[14:23:16] <sfrisk> (got grabbed away)
[14:23:33] <kristyjy> hmm I've never had much of a preference as long as we are consistent
[14:23:44] <geekman-rohit> i like hyphenated in scss
[14:23:50] <geekman-rohit> but they dont go well with jsass
[14:24:00] <geekman-rohit> u have to use double quotes
[14:24:25] <sfrisk> wait, what did I miss?
[14:24:44] <geekman-rohit> geekman-rohit> meh, sfrisk gone
[14:24:44] <geekman-rohit> <geekman-rohit> kristyjy , We need some sort of standard to define variables
[14:24:44] <geekman-rohit> <geekman-rohit> hyphenated or camelcased
[14:25:05] <sfrisk> ahhhhh
[14:25:17] <sfrisk> let me check whaat I did for buttons
[14:25:59] <geekman-rohit> hyphens
[14:26:00] <sfrisk> Looks like I was trying to go with something that was close to our CSS class name rules
[14:26:02] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/96-buttons-take-two/scss/variables/z_buttons.js
[14:26:04] <thej> sfrisk hyphens
[14:26:17] <geekman-rohit> but then u put quotes around them in jsass file
[14:26:28] <geekman-rohit> if we go for hyphens we make the quotes compulsory in jsass
[14:26:33] <geekman-rohit> for uniformity
[14:27:19] <sfrisk> quotes are being used right now in colors: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/blob/master/scss/variables/colors.js
[14:27:30] <geekman-rohit> yep
[14:27:33] <sfrisk> even for the non hyphenated things
[14:27:45] <sfrisk> so quotes as a rule seems like a good idea in general?
[14:27:54] <geekman-rohit> yep
[14:28:19] <geekman-rohit> coz hyphenated makes more sense
[14:28:27] <geekman-rohit> ill update my pr to use quotes and hyphens
[14:28:38] <sfrisk> awesome
[14:28:45] <geekman-rohit> someone put that on styleguide
[14:28:48] <sfrisk> do we have an issue for the jsass style guide?
[14:28:52] <geekman-rohit> anyone has the docs link?
[14:29:03] <sfrisk> @kristyjy
[14:29:16] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/135
[14:30:32] <sfrisk> Okay, want to make a note in there, geekman-rohit, that one of the rules is "use double quotes and hyphens" ?
[14:30:42] <sfrisk> also we should probably have something about file names for variables
[14:30:48] <geekman-rohit> yea
[14:30:51] <geekman-rohit> yeah*
[14:31:00] <sfrisk> I have the buttons PR with a "z_buttons.js" to make sure those variables were done AFTER typography
[14:31:07] <sfrisk> so I could grab the $sans variable
[14:31:19] <geekman-rohit> also it is gonna be hard for new people to go around the whole jsass thingy
[14:31:26] <sfrisk> but we really should maybe have a better method of controlling that over use "Z_" or whatever
[14:31:32] <geekman-rohit> a good wiki page or something will help
[14:31:42] <sfrisk> especially as we develop more components that require pulling from button variables or whatever
[14:31:58] <geekman-rohit> wait i didnt know that
[14:32:07] <sfrisk> yeahhh
[14:32:10] <sfrisk> fun fact!
[14:32:17] <geekman-rohit> weird
[14:32:35] <geekman-rohit> jsass picks up files alphabetically???
[14:32:43] <sfrisk> but adding a "JSASS" note in our getting started section could be helpful
[14:32:44] <sfrisk> apparently
[14:32:52] <geekman-rohit> we need a better way
[14:32:54] <sfrisk> I was throwing a bunch of errors when buttons was happening before typography
[14:32:56] <sfrisk> or colors
[14:33:30] <geekman-rohit> ill ping arschmitz later and get him to have a list of files or something
[14:33:48] <geekman-rohit> it should be like.. we declare a array of file names
[14:33:56] <geekman-rohit> and jsass parses them in that order
[14:34:08] <geekman-rohit> in a config file or something
[14:34:40] <sfrisk> yeah, or figuring out some solution
[14:36:09] <geekman-rohit> i think we should pull buttons in
[14:36:58] <sfrisk> (as a side note, I really think next meeting I am switching away from a spreadsheet and to a google doc)
[14:37:08] <sfrisk> (note writing is hard in this format)
[14:37:17] <sfrisk> I did tweak buttons a bit from last week
[14:37:47] <sfrisk> cascading is no longer a requirement
[14:38:02] <sfrisk> also btn-default and btn-md became their own classes
[14:38:09] <sfrisk> so that all the buttons weren't overwriting the styles on btn
[14:39:59] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/96-buttons-take-two/demos/buttons.html
[14:40:39] <geekman-rohit> the hover style on default
[14:40:43] <geekman-rohit> its too subtle
[14:40:53] <geekman-rohit> you have to be actually looking for it to notice it
[14:41:30] <sfrisk> agreeed
[14:41:43] <sfrisk> that is not accessible at all if it weren't for webkit's SUPER obvious highlighting
[14:41:52] <sfrisk> that might involve updating the color palette
[14:42:19] <thej> yes, hover on the default button is barely noticable
[14:43:15] <sfrisk> actually looks like the colors aren't changing at all
[14:43:22] <sfrisk> they were more obvious last week
[14:43:55] <geekman-rohit> other than that this is a good start
[14:44:01] <sfrisk> default - active there is no change
[14:44:02] <geekman-rohit> we can update later
[14:44:20] <sfrisk> I can add in a stronger color change - then pull in what I have
[14:44:27] <geekman-rohit> sounds great
[14:44:32] <sfrisk> and ping me when your tweaks are done, geekman-rohit, and I'll pull that in
[14:44:38] <geekman-rohit> i was about to say that
[14:44:42] <geekman-rohit> lol
[14:45:02] <geekman-rohit> rohit the official icmp scheduler for chassis
[14:46:28] <geekman-rohit> so we have a palette
[14:46:35] <geekman-rohit> we have a buttons almost done
[14:46:39] <geekman-rohit> base typo
[14:47:22] <sfrisk> I have html4 inputs started
[14:47:40] <sfrisk> although it kinda turned into "validation state styling"
[14:47:50] <sfrisk> kristyjy, any luck on tables?
[14:50:41] <kristyjy> sorry got pulled away
[14:51:15] <sfrisk> taaables?
[14:51:34] <kristyjy> and yeah for tables I will start this week!
[14:52:32] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy you can get a PR up as soon as u start
[14:52:50] <kristyjy> okay
[14:52:51] <geekman-rohit> so we can all bother u with comments and suggestions
[14:53:00] <kristyjy> sounds good lol
[14:53:19] <geekman-rohit> tables is the one thing whose default styling i hate the most
[14:53:48] <geekman-rohit> why in gods name do they have to look so ugly without any styling
[14:55:16] <sfrisk> well we shall be beautiful little butterflies
[14:57:21] <sfrisk> Okay, we've been at this for almost an hour
[14:57:44] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, let me know when you're edits are in, and I'll pull your stuff in
[14:57:47] <geekman-rohit> yeah and I have work tomorrow :(
[14:57:54] <sfrisk> I'll fix the button colors tonight, and pull that in
[14:58:00] <geekman-rohit> sounds good!
[14:58:14] <geekman-rohit> yay to some buttons
[14:58:21] <sfrisk> thej, if you want to do some styling based on what geekman-rohit has done for p, ol, li, etc, that would be awesome
[14:58:26] <sfrisk> kristyjy, is on thables
[14:58:31] <sfrisk> tables*
[14:58:38] <sfrisk> sfrisk is on learning how to type better
[14:58:54] <thej> sfrisk sure, will work on the rest of the typography styling and also on making outline consistent
[14:59:05] <geekman-rohit> thej keep it very simple
[14:59:29] <thej> geekman-rohit will surely do
[14:59:59] <sfrisk> pretty much just setting margins, maybe line heights
[15:00:18] <sfrisk> maybe put it into a variable, since that stuff could be opinionated
[15:00:26] <sfrisk> maybe using paddding over margin
[15:00:26] <sfrisk> s
[15:00:41] <sfrisk> because of the weird margin squishing thing
[15:00:49] <geekman-rohit> a neat combination of both outta be good
[15:00:55] <sfrisk> okay, I thinks that's it
[15:01:00] <sfrisk> anyone have anything else?
[15:02:08] <geekman-rohit> nope
[15:02:13] <arschmitz> sorry all
[15:02:18] <sfrisk> it happens
[15:02:25] <arschmitz> didnt realize the time and that py irc claimed it was cnnected when it was not
[15:02:49] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz we had some query related to jsass
[15:02:55] <arschmitz> ok
[15:02:57] <geekman-rohit> is there a way to define file order?
[15:03:07] <geekman-rohit> for jsass to parse variables
[15:03:17] <sfrisk> right now it does it alphabetically, which is why the buttons file is "z_button"
[15:03:18] <arschmitz> i think so just one sec its been a while let me check
[15:03:26] <sfrisk> to make sure it is done after colors and typography
[15:04:01] <arschmitz> i think its actually being done on our side
[15:04:06] <arschmitz> not the jsass sid
[15:04:34] <arschmitz> but either way this can be fixed
[15:05:35] <arschmitz> ill take a look and either fix in chassis or adjust jsass
[15:06:10] <geekman-rohit> yay
[15:07:48] <arschmitz> right now we are just passing it a single path
[15:07:55] <arschmitz> if we expand the path and pass it an array
[15:08:02] <arschmitz> it will process them in order
[15:08:17] <arschmitz> its basicly just globbing the path you send
[15:08:40] <geekman-rohit> okay
[15:08:46] <arschmitz> right now chassis passes "scss/variables/*"
[15:08:57] <geekman-rohit> it should pass array
[15:09:00] <arschmitz> we should switch that to an array of files in the order
[15:09:02] <arschmitz> we want them
[15:09:11] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[15:09:21] <geekman-rohit> that solves the problem
[15:09:23] <arschmitz> ill do a pr for it
[15:09:31] <arschmitz> apparently i thought ahead on this
[15:09:44] <geekman-rohit> sfrisks internet is being crzy today
[15:09:50] <arschmitz> oh right because we wanted people to be able to include their own files
[15:10:05] <arschmitz> and have an override system which would depend on this ability
[15:10:11] <sfrisk> sorry, keep getting called away for work meetings, don't have my laptop plugged in
[15:10:17] <sfrisk> so if it goes to sleep, all the disconnect
[15:11:15] <arschmitz> we just never built out the tooling to do this on the chassis sisde
[15:12:14] <arschmitz> ill update the variables task and this should be all set
[15:14:34] <sfrisk> awesome, thanks
[15:15:05] <sfrisk> okay, I think that's it for the day for real this time
