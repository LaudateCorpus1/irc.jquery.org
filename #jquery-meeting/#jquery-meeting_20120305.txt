[09:00:57] <rwaldron> howdy DaveMethvin addyosmani_ timmywil
[09:01:09] <timmywil> ohai!
[09:01:15] <timmywil> yay meeting
[09:01:29] <addyosmani> ohai guys
[09:01:41] <sindresorhus> Hi
[09:02:07] <DaveMethvin> hey dere
[09:02:16] <addyosmani> I'm interested in finding out if there's been much progress on the Trac front from last week :)
[09:02:23] <addyosmani> when you get around to it of course!
[09:02:27] <rwaldron> he sindresorhus!
[09:02:30] <rwaldron> hey*
[09:02:35] <DaveMethvin> why is my sound always muting!!!! very annoying
[09:02:45] <DaveMethvin> i miss all my alarms
[09:03:00] <DaveMethvin> ok let me start the agenda
[09:05:14] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin harsh!
[09:05:23] <rwaldron> you sunk my battleship
[09:05:55] <DaveMethvin> the grunt stuff?
[09:05:58] <DaveMethvin> that was from last week
[09:05:59] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:06:03] <DaveMethvin> it's still there
[09:06:11] <rwaldron> I put that in there for this week
[09:06:11] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:06:15] <rwaldron> just like... 3mins ago
[09:06:26] <DaveMethvin> oh then it needs to be moved up ... just a sec
[09:06:36] <rwaldron> I just wanted to report my progress is all :)
[09:06:46] <DaveMethvin> ta da
[09:06:59] <rwaldron> woo!
[09:07:06] <DaveMethvin> ok, lessee here
[09:07:20] <DaveMethvin> does anyone have bugs they wanted to get into 1.7.2?
[09:07:34] <DaveMethvin> i'd still like to get an rc out tomorrow if there isn't anything holding us up
[09:07:57] <DaveMethvin> i was tryna go thru trac over the weekend but it wasn't cooperating
[09:08:12] <rwaldron> so, did anyone follow that PR thread?
[09:08:23] <DaveMethvin> the ie6 one?
[09:08:40] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/699
[09:08:41] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by amonat (23h, 6m ago): Remove obsolete test code. Fixes #11435
[09:08:51] <rwaldron> I haven't had a chance to actually run through these
[09:09:04] <timmywil> tickets I am assigned to page spit out $USER instead of timmywil
[09:09:20] <timmywil> odd
[09:09:40] * DaveMethvin shakes fist ... "TRAC!"
[09:10:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wanted to look at pr699 rwaldron, he may be right
[09:10:27] <DaveMethvin> that would deuglify .data a bit
[09:10:53] <DaveMethvin> plus that was the hack we put in where snover had a comment "this is for 1.5.1 ONLY!" :)
[09:11:02] <DaveMethvin> and it's still there
[09:11:47] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[09:14:52] <DaveMethvin> sorry, back
[09:15:21] <DaveMethvin> ok, anyone else with stuff for 1.7.2 then?
[09:16:27] <DaveMethvin> i'll plan on rolling out the rc tomorrow afternoon if there are no objections then
[09:16:42] <DaveMethvin> if trac holds up i'll try to make a pass through tonight and see if we've missed anything
[09:17:25] <timmywil> I'll go ahead and knock out docs#10870 today
[09:17:27] <bot-t1> [#10870]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10870
[09:17:56] <DaveMethvin> great, thanks timmywil
[09:18:41] <DaveMethvin> i just added an item for unit test failures
[09:19:03] <DaveMethvin> i played with some of these and they seem to be the issue with timing being off when firefox doesn't have focus
[09:19:23] <DaveMethvin> i bumped up a lot of timeouts and got it to behave better locally
[09:19:32] <DaveMethvin> but it's still acting strange when Jenkins runs it
[09:19:51] <DaveMethvin> Anybody with expertise on this?
[09:21:52] <DaveMethvin> looking for a link to the last run to show you
[09:23:39] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/957/
[09:23:48] <DaveMethvin> that was last run
[09:24:03] <DaveMethvin> i have to look at the 3.6 fails, but the effects fails on ff10 are the ones i was talking about
[09:24:52] <rwaldron> blah
[09:24:53] <rwaldron> http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/libs/product-details/json/firefox_versions.json?view=co
[09:24:58] <rwaldron> was hoping it would be gone
[09:25:31] <DaveMethvin> unfortunatley i think it will be around a year or more
[09:25:50] <DaveMethvin> as soon as corporate america adopts it, we are talking about a multi-year death cycle
[09:25:53] <timmywil> haven't looked into it. So the timers do not get cleared when out of focus?
[09:26:08] <DaveMethvin> the timers aren't precise
[09:26:16] <DaveMethvin> so 100ms can be 1 second
[09:26:34] <timmywil> sob
[09:26:36] <DaveMethvin> and a few of our tests are like, "animation stopped about halfway thru"
[09:26:43] <timmywil> right
[09:26:44] <DaveMethvin> which is kinda risky anyway
[09:26:59] <DaveMethvin> so i had to switch 100/200ms to 1000/2000ms
[09:26:59] <timmywil> yea, but is there another way to test that?
[09:27:08] <DaveMethvin> probably not
[09:27:21] <DaveMethvin> i can try pushing up the timeouts even more
[09:27:50] <timmywil> well, we could have a step function that calls stop when it reaches a certain value I suppose
[09:27:57] <timmywil> but ugh
[09:28:07] <DaveMethvin> but there are a LOT of animation tests that use settimeout delays
[09:28:13] <timmywil> yes there are
[09:28:28] <DaveMethvin> i started to change more of them and then wondered whether it was a good idea
[09:28:37] <timmywil> well, this is test suite problem, not a library problem
[09:28:49] <DaveMethvin> agreed, i just don't like jenky hollerin at me
[09:29:05] <DaveMethvin> plus i am starting to treat him like the boy who cried wolf
[09:29:12] <timmywil> heh, yea
[09:29:19] <DaveMethvin> every once in a while he's right
[09:29:32] <DaveMethvin> it might be the case for this 3.6 problem, i dunno
[09:31:30] <rwaldron> Sorry, I'm a abit confused....
[09:31:43] <rwaldron> the failures in that PR thread - are those related?
[09:31:53] <rwaldron> or is this in addition?
[09:32:06] <DaveMethvin> these are ff10 failures
[09:32:16] <DaveMethvin> related to their treatment of timeouts when not in focus
[09:32:17] <rwaldron> ok gotcha
[09:32:19] <DaveMethvin> at least i think it is
[09:32:27] <DaveMethvin> I'll see if we can find a solution for those unit test issues, but i agree that it's not a library issue
[09:32:30] <timmywil> seems reasonable
[09:32:38] <rwaldron> that's what I thought, but I wasn't sure if there was a connection between these and those
[09:32:46] <rwaldron> it doesn't seem so...
[09:32:52] <DaveMethvin> i don't think so either
[09:32:59] <rwaldron> that's where I was confused
[09:33:04] <rwaldron> i mentioned the PR thread
[09:33:10] <DaveMethvin> i would just be a lot happier if jenky would say SUCCESS
[09:33:16] <rwaldron> and then the conversation jumped into this
[09:33:30] <rwaldron> sorry for the unne. confusion!
[09:33:40] <DaveMethvin> no confusion is ever unnecessary
[09:33:43] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:34:02] <DaveMethvin> Soooo, how bout that 1.8?
[09:35:22] <DaveMethvin> i have some stuff started to refactor and identify dependencies, once 1.7.2 is out I'll get back to that
[09:35:54] <DaveMethvin> i think a lot of this will be "behind the scenes" and not have to involve api changes beyond what we've already identified
[09:36:12] <rwaldron> looking forward to it
[09:36:25] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i'm looking forward to seeing the grunt stuff
[09:36:28] <rwaldron> I wish I could see the 1.8 ticket list
[09:36:31] <rwaldron> it's sassy
[09:36:43] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin after the meeting, I will push up my progress
[09:37:12] <timmywil> I haven't had time to destroy sizzle yet, but I will
[09:37:19] <rwaldron> i just finished doing the "sizzle-jquery.js into sizzle.js into selector.js" dance
[09:37:44] <DaveMethvin> any other issues to discuss?
[09:38:30] <DaveMethvin> well then, go forth and code!
[09:38:34] <rwaldron> WAIT
[09:38:38] <rwaldron> 1.8 all tickets:
[09:38:39] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?milestone=1.8&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&report=206&order=priority
[09:38:45] <rwaldron> there wasn't a report for it
[09:38:47] <rwaldron> now there is
[09:38:49] <rwaldron> have fun
[09:38:50] <rwaldron> <3
[09:38:57] <DaveMethvin> thanks rwaldron!
[09:39:12] <DaveMethvin> now all we need is a bug tracker that can show the report!
[09:39:25] <DaveMethvin> only took 25 seconds.
[09:39:34] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[09:39:56] <DaveMethvin> i can hardly wait to see timmywil fix :not(:has(:has(*)))  :)
[09:40:14] <DaveMethvin> the key is to separate the :has from the :has:not
[09:40:16] <timmywil> FUUUUUU
[09:40:18] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:40:40] <timmywil> :has or :has:not, that is the question
[09:41:01] <DaveMethvin> :is()  .... :is(:not)!
[09:41:09] <DaveMethvin> sounds like me arguing as a kid
[09:41:23] <timmywil> there is no :try!
[09:41:47] <DaveMethvin> words of wisdom from yoda
[09:42:28] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: fyi, I just tested ie9 and got the same stop fails in effects out of focus
[09:43:07] <timmywil> also, my browserstack seems to be unhappy testing ie6
[09:43:12] <DaveMethvin> hmm, that's odd
[09:43:14] <timmywil> but I don't think that's a jquery issue
[09:43:35] <DaveMethvin> maybe the ie9 was in focus, that is scary to think about
[09:43:57] <DaveMethvin> we need consistent unit tests!
[09:44:29] <DaveMethvin> hmm, maybe we could use the new visibility api and only bump up the timeouts if the browser was out of focus
[09:45:37] <DaveMethvin> in any case it might be a good idea to have a unitTestDelay variable rather than hard-wire all these 100ms everywhere
[09:45:53] <DaveMethvin> then make the other delay be a multiple
[09:46:01] <DaveMethvin> a few of the unit tests do define the delay as a variable
[09:46:37] <timmywil> we can check if an animation is in progress
[09:46:55] <timmywil> that doesn't really fix it
[09:47:00] <timmywil> nvm
[09:47:41] <DaveMethvin> i think this is akin to a crazy guy trying to figure out if he is crazy
[09:48:07] <DaveMethvin> we aren't really sure which parts of the environment are trustworthy
[09:48:42] <DaveMethvin> "Delay 100ms? Sure, or something like that, maybe 1200ms, that's pretty close"
[09:48:58] <timmywil> not exactly consistent
[09:50:24] <DaveMethvin> i was tryna think if i've seen the problem in other browsers, you said you just saw it in ie9 but i don't think i've ever seen it in chrome
[09:50:38] <DaveMethvin> and i test out of focus with it all the time
[09:51:20] <timmywil> just ie9 and FF for me so far
[09:54:26] <DaveMethvin> ok, i gotta run for a few minutes, but should be in #jquery-dev most of the afternoon
[09:54:30] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys!
