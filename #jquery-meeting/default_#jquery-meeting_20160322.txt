[14:01:34] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time
[14:03:47] <sfrisk> finishing up the agenda one moment
[14:03:56] <kristyjy> okay
[14:06:48] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:07:44] <sfrisk> kristyjy, geekman-rohit, arschmitz
[14:08:13] <kristyjy_> sorry our internet just went out lol
[14:08:23] <sfrisk> It happens
[14:09:22] <sfrisk> So we have a number of items in review right now that need to be looked over
[14:09:48] <arschmitz> got double booked today
[14:09:57] <arschmitz> so only kinda here
[14:10:38] <sfrisk> actually, you know what
[14:10:46] <sfrisk> GSOC Q and A time
[14:10:56] <sfrisk> I think this is the last meeting before proposal time runs out
[14:11:06] <sfrisk> so if you've got questions, throw them at us while we're here
[14:11:15] <sfrisk> (and aso review PRS that are currently open)
[14:11:32] <thej> is there a limit on the number of pages in a proposal ?
[14:11:51] <kristyjy_> I will work on making a more finalized version of the tables PR this week. I meant to do that last week but you know life :)
[14:12:16] <sfrisk> thej: no
[14:12:32] <thej> sfrisk: ok cool
[14:12:47] <nashvail> Do mentors give  a green light to like go ahead and make a PDF and do the final submission ? Or ..
[14:12:52] <nashvail> how does that work ?
[14:13:06] <nashvail> Of the proposal I mean
[14:13:38] <sfrisk> One moment, let me check
[14:13:48] <sfrisk> they completely changed how the site worked from last year
[14:14:04] <nashvail> sure
[14:14:15] <geekman-rohit> nashvail usually if we have nothing to say
[14:14:38] <geekman-rohit> that would be a good sign its ready to go ahead
[14:14:57] <sfrisk> I did go through some apps this morning
[14:15:05] <sfrisk> I'm going to try and go through stuff this evening again too
[14:15:41] <nashvail> The site does say to submit a PDF even if you've not received any feedbacks or such
[14:16:39] <sfrisk> I think PDF makes it final, but in the doc format it is easier for us to comment
[14:18:25] <nashvail> I think that'll do for my GSOC questions.
[14:18:34] <nashvail> Shall we discuss PRs?
[14:18:43] <sfrisk> anyone else have questions?
[14:19:10] <thej> that will be it from my side too, thanks
[14:21:14] <geekman-rohit> We do expect some discussion about your project done with the team
[14:21:28] <sfrisk> that is a good point
[14:21:34] <sfrisk> also in general, the way we did it last year
[14:21:40] <sfrisk> is that we had two checkin days a week
[14:21:53] <sfrisk> where mentor/student talked about how the project was going, what progress had been made, etc
[14:21:59] <geekman-rohit> also
[14:22:17] <geekman-rohit> since there are only a few days left, anyone who hasn't discussed their proposal with us yet
[14:22:21] <geekman-rohit> now would be the time
[14:23:06] <nashvail> geekman-rohit discussed in the sense?
[14:29:00] <thej> geekman-rohit: should we be discussing our approaches to the project with the mentors ?
[14:29:10] <sfrisk> in general, yes
[14:30:19] <thej> ok. sounds great
[14:31:15] <sfrisk> It helps make sure your proposal is actually tailored to the needs of the project
[14:32:13] <rawteech> hello team, following up the discussions, thanks
[14:32:15] <geekman-rohit> sorry got dragged off
[14:32:20] <nashvail> the project discussions are done via PMs right?
[14:32:35] <sfrisk> PM, although honestly email also makes sure we get the mesages
[14:32:41] <geekman-rohit> nashvail project discussion as in general discussion
[14:32:53] <geekman-rohit> what technologies will the project use,
[14:33:32] <geekman-rohit> for example for websites : how will documentation be maintained? will be be autogenerated
[14:33:35] <geekman-rohit> that sort of thing
[14:33:43] <nashvail> I tried to initiate a discussion but didn't really get any replies ðŸ˜› thought
[14:33:47] <nashvail> though*
[14:33:52] <geekman-rohit> you should have a clear idea about what you are going to do in the next 3 months
[14:34:12] <sfrisk> IRC isn't always the best way to contact me directly - I am normally at work during the day and can't always pay attention
[14:34:50] <sfrisk> But in general, if you're doing components for example, I want a detailed list of what components you plan on working on
[14:34:58] <sfrisk> and any alternate styling states you might have
[14:35:18] <sfrisk> for example, we have basic table stylings, but some optional classes for striped rows, or something like that
[14:37:09] <nashvail> Ah ok. Makes sense
[14:37:31] <geekman-rohit> also the order you would be doing those components in
[14:37:48] <geekman-rohit> some might be priority for jquery
[14:37:54] <codenirvana> geekman-rohit: I think the docs. needs to be stored saperately and later load the file using AJAX in order to make it manageable!
[14:38:03] <thej> geekman-rohit: that would be listed in the timeline right ?
[14:38:13] <geekman-rohit> yes, thej
[14:40:01] <rawteech> geekman-rohit, each component to be given it's own timeline or?
[14:40:26] <geekman-rohit> rawteech, not necessarily
[14:40:40] <geekman-rohit> you should have a clear picture of how you will implement each component
[14:40:59] <geekman-rohit> and how much time roughly it will take, also names of the components
[14:41:09] <arschmitz> woo just got new jsass working in chassis
[14:41:34] <geekman-rohit> if you are adding anything new that is not usually part of css frameworks, discussing it with team would be good
[14:41:39] <geekman-rohit> woohoo!!
[14:41:55] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, thats great!
[14:42:00] <rawteech> ok, thats better...
[14:42:07] <arschmitz> was getting all sorts of sass errors
[14:42:25] <geekman-rohit> so function(){return 'x' } ??
[14:42:41] <arschmitz> thats not part of it
[14:42:46] <arschmitz> but can be
[14:42:49] <geekman-rohit> oh
[14:42:55] <arschmitz> but i would never suggest that syntax
[14:43:03] <arschmitz> () => "x"
[14:43:07] <sfrisk> arschmitz: yay!
[14:43:19] <arschmitz> thats wat will be documented in jsass
[14:43:35] <rawteech> geekman-rohit, anything new would mean? kindly expound...
[14:44:04] <geekman-rohit> if your component list includes normal buttons/forms/grids/panel etc. that would be good
[14:44:12] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: what you wrote would work of course it just wont be the recomended syntax
[14:44:27] <sfrisk> although I already did buttons :-)
[14:44:39] <geekman-rohit> but if you plan to add something new as in ... a carousel etc. that would need discussion
[14:44:45] <geekman-rohit> esp. since we are css only
[14:44:53] <geekman-rohit> anything that needs js, should be discussed
[14:45:04] <sfrisk> We do want more complex components for JS frameworks to use in the future - a good idea of what we would need in the future you can find looking at jQuery mobile
[14:45:07] <arschmitz> yeah will need discussion with lib people
[14:45:15] <sfrisk> but we would like simple components done first, and those have priority
[14:45:23] <arschmitz> for what the interaction / css api etc would look like
[14:45:38] <arschmitz> and make sure libs are actually interested in the component
[14:45:55] <arschmitz> dont want to implement something no one in the lib community is interested in
[14:46:20] <rawteech> how about components like modals? needs  a little bit of jquery
[14:46:35] <arschmitz> rawteech: so thats a phase 2 thing
[14:46:37] <arschmitz> but on the map
[14:46:46] <arschmitz> and we would do the css markup
[14:46:53] <geekman-rohit> rawteech what arschmitz said
[14:46:56] <arschmitz> and leave the js to someone like jQuery ui or mobile
[14:46:58] <thej> so, for example, writing styles for tooltips and collapsible elements is not a part of this GSoC project ?
[14:47:01] <geekman-rohit> we would do only the markup and css
[14:47:06] <arschmitz> or dojo
[14:47:09] <arschmitz> or who ever
[14:47:12] <geekman-rohit> it is thej
[14:47:16] <geekman-rohit> we make styles for them
[14:47:22] <geekman-rohit> we dont implement them with js
[14:47:27] <arschmitz> just markup and style
[14:47:51] <thej> we make styles and amrkup that work alongside with jQuery UI/mobile
[14:47:55] <thej> *markup
[14:47:59] <geekman-rohit> yes
[14:48:06] <geekman-rohit> or any other ui library
[14:48:26] <geekman-rohit> thats one of the original ideas behind chassis
[14:48:40] <thej> setting only css standards
[14:48:46] <arschmitz> yes
[14:48:57] <rawteech> oh, wow... was abit worried of having to write the js first, but since we are only focusing on styling then its great
[14:49:06] <arschmitz> yes
[14:49:16] <arschmitz> we need to make it so frameworks
[14:49:24] <arschmitz> can just hook into our markup and classes
[14:49:42] <thej> right
[14:49:49] <sfrisk> we're trying to create a common language for JS frameworks to use when describing components with css
[14:52:21] <thej> are we looking to support IE8 as well ?
[14:52:40] <arschmitz> no i dont think so
[14:52:52] <arschmitz> all the frameworks we have worked with dropped support
[14:53:18] <thej> Ah. ok
[14:54:03] <sfrisk> but do make sure it works with all modern browsers
[14:54:06] <geekman-rohit_> Anything I missed?
[14:54:33] <sfrisk> safari/chrome/firefox/Microsoft Edge/and a few verisons of IE (back to 10?)
[14:55:33] <sfrisk> Also
[14:55:36] <sfrisk> as a general heads up
[14:55:57] <arschmitz> most thing are doing ie11
[14:56:00] <arschmitz> including ui and mobile
[14:56:05] <sfrisk> if we've never had a conversation with you, and you send us a proposal, we're unlikely to pick someone we've never had a conversation with
[14:56:29] <arschmitz> microsoft basicly dropped everything prior to 11
[14:56:51] <thej> sfrisk: fair enough
[14:57:27] <rawteech> sfrisk: got it
[14:57:39] <sfrisk> so if you've been lurking up until this point, while I get that it's sometimes scary talking to strangers on the internet - we do expect you to participate in meetings, and we would actually like to know who you are
[14:58:12] <thej> arschmitz: Does Chassis have a Sauce Labs account ?
[14:58:23] <arschmitz> no we use browserstack
[14:59:06] <thej> oh ok
[14:59:07] <geekman-rohit_> Yes.
[14:59:19] <geekman-rohit_> We would certainly like to know who you are when reading proposals
[14:59:27] <geekman-rohit_> Or its all french
[14:59:39] <geekman-rohit_> Since we don't know you or your coding skills
[15:00:26] <rawteech> a small question still on the css components, I wanted to work on the scroll bars... is it a good idea?
[15:00:43] <arschmitz> no
[15:00:54] <arschmitz> its only supported in one browser basicly
[15:01:06] <thej> firefox doesnt support it
[15:01:09] <arschmitz> nope
[15:01:14] <arschmitz> and neither does edge
[15:01:34] <rawteech> oh, wow... thanks for the heads up arschmitz
[15:01:53] <arschmitz> and its not on the standards track
[15:02:00] <arschmitz> so unlikely to show up in any new browsers
[15:02:16] <rawteech> but I wish all browser could just move with the trend and be more dynamic
[15:02:19] <arschmitz> it was in ie removed in edge
[15:02:38] <rawteech> will have to drop it then, thanks...
[15:02:51] <thej_> you can follow the rants here https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77790
[15:02:56] <thej_> quite interesting
[15:06:59] <rawteech> thanks thej_ , quite useful...
[15:09:53] <sfrisk> also if you're wondering what is supported and what isn't by various browsers:
[15:09:54] <sfrisk> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
[15:10:03] <sfrisk> http://caniuse.com/
[15:10:51] <nashvail> caniuse has a CLI as well super hc
[15:10:54] <nashvail> handy*
[15:11:45] <thej> naice !! I use the chrome extension most of the time
[15:13:06] <nashvail> In the last meeting we discussed about storing colors in some sort of global variable. Anyone working on that?
[15:13:42] <rawteech> sfrisk: thats great, I wish I had those resources long before...
[15:14:11] <sfrisk> we already have that nashvail
[15:14:24] <sfrisk> there is a colors variable - arschmitz was updating JSASS to do some stuff we wanted
[15:15:35] <sfrisk> Okay everyone
[15:15:38] <sfrisk> I need to get back to work
[15:15:46] <sfrisk> feel free to email me if you have questions
