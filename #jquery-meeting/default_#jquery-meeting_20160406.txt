[12:02:00] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:07] <fnagel> hey
[12:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> Our PR count is lower :-)
[12:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> And we've got a few that are awaiting feedback.
[12:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> Which unfortunately probably means they will close in a week when we don't get responses.
[12:05:33] <jzaefferer> There should be two more mostly ready to land (globals, line length, both updated today)
[12:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> So the only real item on the agenda is 1.12.0-rc.2
[12:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Are you reviewing the test updates?
[12:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like you already started digging in.
[12:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> I can do a review of the line length updates that arschmitz just pushed.
[12:07:32] <jzaefferer> yeah, I'll try to review the test stuff
[12:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[12:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else that should get into RC 2?
[12:11:42] <jzaefferer> we have more than I expected already: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/1.12.0-rc.1...master
[12:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, because arschmitz and I went through the PRs.
[12:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to address the CLA issue too.
[12:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't gotten a response from Dan yet, so we'll probably just end up with the mailmap entry on our own.
[12:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> But we should do that before the RC, so we don't end up with the bad name and email in the AUTHORS file.
[12:13:52] <arschmitz> +1
[12:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just do that after the meeting. If he comes back and replies, we can always update.
[12:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[12:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all. Thanks everyone.
