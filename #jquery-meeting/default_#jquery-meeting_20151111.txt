[11:58:40] <mikesherov_> hey all, just wanted to let you know I'll be back in business with this team at the beginning of December
[11:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> woohoo
[11:59:21] <mikesherov_> I was thinking to continue down the interactions path and using PEP
[11:59:34] <mikesherov_> and with that, improving jquery-simulate
[11:59:55] <mikesherov_> I have a meeting I need to be at today, but perhaps scott_gonzalez you and I can discuss how that fits into roadmap later?
[12:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'd actually prefer moving to web driver instead of putting more effort into jquery-simulate.
[12:00:48] <jzaefferer> mikesherov_: that's great!
[12:01:09] <jzaefferer> picking this up would help a lot: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611
[12:02:09] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: we can discuss both
[12:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:02:29] <mikesherov_> the simulate approach is good for cross boundary testing
[12:02:53] <mikesherov_> meaning, need to inspect javascript state while also simulating
[12:03:10] <mikesherov_> and requires way less infra and time to spin up.
[12:03:26] <mikesherov_> but yeah, we also need webdriver for that which can't possibly be faithfully simulated
[12:03:30] <mikesherov_> like focus, etc.
[12:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> I talked to TJ as well. He's still very busy and won't become active again any time soon.
[12:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> But he's happy to help out where needed if we ping him.
[12:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard back from anyone about button accessibility.
[12:09:29] <jzaefferer> I've asked rxaviers to look at https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/282#issuecomment-153057510 again - once I get some help there, I hope to be able to fix that
[12:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Did you see rxaviers' email about firstDay?
[12:12:34] <fnagel> yes
[12:12:54] <fnagel> But I had no time to really try this
[12:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:13:45] <fnagel> Same for his info about hot to hadle cldr in the grunt task (via skype)
[12:13:55] <fnagel> * how not hot :-D
[12:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> I assume there's nothing else to discuss for datepicker this week.
[12:15:48] <fnagel> no
[12:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> I've been making progress on the upgrade guide.
[12:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> Just have the effect rewrite to do.
[12:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> I filed an issue to get api.jqueryui.com/1.12/ set up as well, but haven't heard anything.
[12:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know everything involved in doing that so we can just do it ourselves?
[12:19:25] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure. Adding the site is the one thing I can think of, but there's probably more
[12:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> The jquery-wp-content part is easy.
[12:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's the nginx and deploy script part that I'm not sure of.
[12:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe if we just search for api.jqueryui.com/1.10 in the infra repo?
[12:22:44] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/02a422aa151a51fd97ada02d191afcb12bf1ce12/manifests/nodes/builder.pp#L75-L80
[12:23:58] <jzaefferer> https://stage.api.jqueryui.com/ doesn't work (for me), so I guess we have to test on live
[12:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> That works for m.e
[12:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> After the security warning.
[12:28:46] <jzaefferer> mh, not it works
[12:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:30:08] <jzaefferer> *now
[12:30:26] <jzaefferer> start with puppet, then update jquery-wp-content?
[12:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> If that's all we need to do for the infra repo, this should be easy.
[12:31:34] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/628c8e0554a09e5f98397935eac1b1c7640f6122
[12:31:52] <jzaefferer> if you update jquery-wp-content, we should be able to test on stage
[12:32:02] <jzaefferer> then merge that commit to puppet-master
[12:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:32:07] <jzaefferer> I've got to go now though
[12:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> Will you be back around today?
[12:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> There's a proposal to add new elements to handle accordions and tabs: http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/11/panels-and-panel-sets.html
[12:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> For anyone interested, read through that post and you can provide feedback in #jqueryui-dev or https://github.com/bkardell/common-panel/issues
[12:36:42] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today. Thanks everyone.
