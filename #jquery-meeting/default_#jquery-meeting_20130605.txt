[09:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: jzaefferer kborchers rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:01:17] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> I just need a minute to finish writing an email.
[09:01:43] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:02:11] <gnarf> hi - i'm way busy today, but holla if you need my opnion
[09:02:58] <kborchers> hey
[09:04:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i copied the sheet in the agenda but will let you update as needed
[09:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks kborchers.
[09:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, email sent.
[09:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> Let's just start with the topic of that email :-)
[09:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> On Yesterday's PEWG call, I mentioned that we started our own Pointer Events polyfill because of the lack of browser support in other polyfills.
[09:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> Rick Byers (Google rep) said that he would talk to the Polymer team about whether they would be willing to add support for oldIE.
[09:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> You may recall the Tool Kitchen implementation from last year.
[09:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> But when we talked to Daniel Freedman about oldIE support back in November, he was concerned about how hard/different it would be.
[09:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> That's the code that became the Polymer implementation.
[09:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> And after Rick talked to the Polymer team, they agreed to add support if we agree to collaborate with them.
[09:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> You can see the announcement here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2013AprJun/0182.html
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> So we're going to ditch our special events implementation and go with Polymer.
[09:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers started testing it last night.
[09:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> With a pointer event implementation, we'll probably remove our abstraction and go back to using real events in interaction plugins.
[09:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> I guess nobody is excited about this, so we'll move on :-P
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll has a pull request to add theming information for all widgets: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/144
[09:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> We've done a few rounds of review and updates, so I think it's ready to land now.
[09:18:29] <kborchers> thanks :)
[09:18:34] <tj_vantoll> I'm excited :)
[09:18:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: me too
[09:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> me three :-)
[09:19:09] <kborchers> my next question was going to be about going back to native events for pointer stuff
[09:19:12] <kborchers> :)
[09:19:18] <tj_vantoll> Once we verify it's working is the plan to start using it in the interactions branch fairly soon?
[09:19:35] <kborchers> since when i was playing last night i was having to pull the original event out of the jQuery event :)
[09:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, once we know it's working, we should pull it in.
[09:20:08] <jzaefferer> here now
[09:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Oh, hmm...we may need to add an event hook to say which properties to copy over.
[09:20:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what email?
[09:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: An email to SFC.
[09:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Verifying that any work Kris does on Polymer for the Pointer Events polyfill is covered by his contract.
[09:22:02] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:23:21] <jzaefferer> Is there a special hook to copy additional props for certain events?
[09:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> There's $.event.fixHooks.
[09:24:33] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: when you talk about oldIE, does that refer to IE6? Or IE6-8?
[09:24:46] <rxaviers> Maybe this is a very dump question. But, is polymer going to be a dependency for jquery-ui? So, for someone to use jquery-ui, he will need to load jquery, polymer, then jquery-ui?
[09:24:49] <jzaefferer> I wonder why we worry about IE6, when UI doesn't support that anymore
[09:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, in terms of Polymer it refers to IE6-9.
[09:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> Core supports it.
[09:25:20] <rxaviers> Or are we going to bundle it together? (I dont think so right)
[09:25:25] <jzaefferer> Sure, but as a UI dependency, IE6 matters less?
[09:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> The goals is core support.
[09:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> The goal was always IE6 support for pointer events, since we want it in core.
[09:26:07] <jzaefferer> Ah, okay
[09:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We'll probably bundle it.
[09:26:18] <jzaefferer> Looks like $.event.fixHooks is an undocumented API..
[09:26:35] <rxaviers> ah ok
[09:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It's a safe API for us.
[09:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to talk about download builder?
[09:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of activity this week.
[09:30:58] <rxaviers> sure
[09:31:04] <rxaviers> Everything that only runs when releasing jQuery UI is not inside its Gruntfile anymore. build/release/release.js has been updated to call a DB methods instead of invoking grunt tasks.
[09:31:22] <rxaviers> this is under review now. pretty much finished finally
[09:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to do a review of everything at the conf.
[09:31:52] <rxaviers> great, ok.
[09:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's so many PRs spread across multiple repos, it'll be easier to just do it in person.
[09:32:14] <rxaviers> I've made the slight necessary change to jquery-ui. So, we have a ready PR too.
[09:32:19] <rxaviers> Yeap, ok.
[09:32:47] <rxaviers> The next thing I am working on now is to DB support 1.11
[09:33:18] <rxaviers> with this, I mean support the few structural changes we did, like splitting effects and merging docs.
[09:33:33] <rxaviers> (If that's gonna be on 1.11)
[09:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> Once we have this split done and the conf is over, I should be able to work with you on the changes inside jquery-ui to clean up all the conditionals in DB.
[09:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll all be in 1.11.
[09:34:09] <rxaviers> ok.
[09:35:03] <rxaviers> If there's anything else you want me in, pls just let me know
[09:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:36:11] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:38:07] <tj_vantoll> There are 2 tickets I wanted to get some opinions on but I'll hop into -dev for that.
[09:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok, see everyone back in -dev
[09:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> no meeting next week
