[11:04:05] <arschmitz> Iv added open tickets and open pr's to the top of the agenda
[11:04:30] <arschmitz> and will update weekly so we can start trying to be more aware and proactive on keeping up on issues
[11:06:54] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=41

[11:07:14] <arschmitz> Open PR's: 37
[11:07:38] <arschmitz> that will go down a lot this afternoon
[11:07:46] <arschmitz> there are a bunch im going to land
[11:08:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome!
[11:08:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you have some ready as well
[11:08:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, sweet!
[11:08:17] * gabriel_schulhof kracks his knuckles
[11:08:29] * gabriel_schulhof fires up his ATC console
[11:09:42] <arschmitz> so i think the plan is still on to release 1.4.4 in chicago
[11:09:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: are you going to be there?
[11:09:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Yessir!
[11:10:00] <arschmitz> execlent
[11:10:26] <gseguin> release on stage?
[11:10:32] <arschmitz> maybe
[11:10:35] <gseguin> successfully this time :D
[11:10:52] <arschmitz> ha ha
[11:11:00] <cgack> lets hope npm doesn't go down
[11:11:19] <arschmitz> ha right
[11:11:26] <arschmitz> iv got my own wifi connection this time
[11:11:33] <arschmitz> to a sever where ill run in screen
[11:11:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Remember to screen + ssh from the actual machine where the release happens.
[11:11:37] <gseguin> and make sure we have plenty of bandwith for the team/presenters computers
[11:11:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. Yeah.
[11:11:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: there is not going to be dedicated wifi for us this time
[11:12:09] <arschmitz> its allready been sent to presenters to make them aware
[11:12:21] <gseguin> is or is NOT ?
[11:12:27] <arschmitz> NOT
[11:12:37] <gseguin> ok
[11:12:55] <arschmitz> im going to tether to the 4g on my cell phone for it
[11:13:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i saw some news about the samsung folks this morning
[11:14:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, they bowed out until at least next year.
[11:14:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Too busy on another project.
[11:15:32] <arschmitz> ok
[11:16:53] <arschmitz> well thats the nature of it
[11:17:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep. People come, people go, but the project continues.
[11:19:08] <arschmitz> ok so i think we will be looking pretty good for 1.4.4 prs most will land in next couple days i think
[11:19:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome!
[11:19:40] <gabriel_schulhof> There are a few issues I'm looking into that I'm not too sure about.
[11:19:58] <arschmitz> i reviewed a lot of 1.5 ones over last few days as well
[11:20:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: links?
[11:20:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Here's one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7607
[11:21:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and huh? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6088
[11:21:29] <gabriel_schulhof> How can you Ajax local files?
[11:21:32] <arschmitz> for active in widget this should work
[11:21:42] <arschmitz> in most cases i dont think you can
[11:22:06] <arschmitz> in fact i saw someone asking this very thing in #jquery today
[11:22:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Asking whether Ajaxing local files works?
[11:22:30] <arschmitz> wanting to do it with jqm
[11:23:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't see how https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6088 is even valid given you can't Ajax local files.
[11:23:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its not that simple it actually varies between browsers
[11:23:32] <arschmitz> some let you
[11:23:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Great!
[11:23:42] <arschmitz> chrome does not
[11:23:45] <arschmitz> ff does
[11:24:12] <arschmitz> for reference in chrome https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40787
[11:24:53] <arschmitz> ff has a same directory origin policy
[11:25:01] <arschmitz> ie allows it for the most part i think
[11:27:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but in short close that issue there is nothing we can do this is all about the browsers security policy for files system
[11:28:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: maybe link to the chrome ticket it has some good refrence on the subject
[11:29:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, *sigh* ... it seems like we're not properly supporting Safari then, though ...
[11:29:58] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, if it /does/ support Ajax, maybe we should at least try to figure out why it doesn't work.
[11:30:09] <arschmitz> i didnt say safari does?
[11:30:56] <arschmitz> infact im quite sure safari does not
[11:31:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... OK, then I'll close it.
[11:32:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright. That's all I got.
[11:32:57] <arschmitz> ok
[11:33:05] <cgack> I had a question about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7636
[11:33:05] <cgack> is it really expected that we would support mouse moves at 25/100,000,000 precision
[11:33:54] <gabriel_schulhof> What?! That's, like, what 1/10 of a pixel at 1080?
[11:34:03] <cgack> exactly
[11:34:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait ... much less than that.
[11:34:08] <arschmitz> lol thats not possible
[11:34:21] <gabriel_schulhof> The most we can do is 1 / 1080 :)
[11:35:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, if the mouse moves slowly enough, we get absolutely every pixel's worth of change.
[11:35:48] <cgack> well I couldn't think of a nice way to comment "What!!!!?" so I thought I'd bring it here
[11:35:57] <arschmitz> right but we cant capture tiny fractions of pixels
[11:37:26] <arschmitz> so nothing new on pointer events
[11:37:47] <arschmitz> there will be a meeting next week after which we should know more on our future direction
[11:38:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Sounds like our vmouse has once more gone from being downstream to being upstream.
[11:39:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i would not say that there is pretty much no possibility of use continuing to use vmouse
[11:39:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but time frame is unsure
[11:39:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, if not vmouse then what?
[11:39:37] <gabriel_schulhof> The industry cannot seem to agree.
[11:39:50] <arschmitz> what ever the foundation as a whole decides to go with
[11:40:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, absolutely, but there is no such thing.
[11:40:28] <arschmitz> vmouse does not support pointer events multi input devices or multi touch
[11:40:41] <arschmitz> so its really not at all a workable solution anymore
[11:41:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, hold on a minute. mouse{up,down,move} doesn't support any of that either, right?
[11:41:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Only touch events support that.
[11:41:48] <arschmitz> or pointer events
[11:41:59] <gabriel_schulhof> RIght, yeah.
[11:42:01] <arschmitz> or other abstractions using touch and pointer
[11:42:15] <arschmitz> and multi input is about things with both mouse and touch / pointer
[11:42:30] <arschmitz> which we dont correctly support currently
[11:43:09] <gabriel_schulhof> So, multi-input may need to be implemented natively using touch events.
[11:43:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Or it may need to be implemented using pointer events.
[11:43:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the point is whatever we decide on will handle all these issues
[11:44:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What is the range of options from among which we can pick?
[11:44:19] <arschmitz> pointer events solve many of these which is why we liked them and wanted to go that route
[11:44:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, but now Google pulled out.
[11:44:36] <arschmitz> there is not a specific set of options
[11:44:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: both microsoft and mozilla still intend to continue with pointer
[11:45:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess that's still sufficient for establishing a standard - presumably.
[11:46:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we are meeting next week with members of the working group and people from various companies and browser vendors to try to figure out the best direction to go from here
[11:46:23] <arschmitz> so i really cant say anything as to what we will do until after that
[11:46:34] <gabriel_schulhof> I was gonna ask: Can I listen in on that meeting somehow, or is it strictyl face-to-face?
[11:46:52] <arschmitz> talk to kris
[11:47:06] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:49:22] <arschmitz> i dont think i have anything else for today
[11:49:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Nope ...
[11:49:29] <arschmitz> does any one else have anything ?
[11:50:07] <cgack> i'm good
[11:50:09] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[11:50:39] <arschmitz> oops little quick there :)
[11:51:00] <arschmitz> ok well see everyone back on -dev!
[11:51:09] <gabriel_schulhof> CYA!
