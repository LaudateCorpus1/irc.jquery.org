[09:00:41] <DaveMethvin> ho boy, meetin' time!
[09:00:52] <DaveMethvin> who's around?
[09:01:56] <DaveMethvin> i spy with my eye ... gibson0421 timmywil m_gol markelog rwaldron
[09:02:09] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1su2ZTFZbnp_DD-LGZleuEudTFRJT_g4zf7UfGOMQvco/edit
[09:02:31] <m_gol> present
[09:02:49] <DaveMethvin> alright!
[09:02:50] <gibson0421> you spy correctly
[09:02:59] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:03:18] <DaveMethvin> nice
[09:03:42] <DaveMethvin> so things are looking pretty good so far
[09:03:53] <DaveMethvin> i expected more stuff to break when markelog landed all those pulls :)
[09:04:14] <m_gol> ;)
[09:04:21] <DaveMethvin> just have that one onerror issue, which was there already
[09:04:25] <m_gol> yup
[09:04:28] <markelog> spend some time preparing them :-)
[09:04:36] <DaveMethvin> now i'm starting to wonder if onerror works for injected scripts on android 2.3
[09:05:04] <m_gol> I can't believe how bad this browser is
[09:05:14] <markelog> need to look at this closely, how that code works not just on the code
[09:05:17] <DaveMethvin> and then the one small problem with ie8 and migrate
[09:05:24] <DaveMethvin> any other test issues?
[09:05:34] <m_gol> this problem was already there, it just wasn't tested ;P
[09:05:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:05:56] <m_gol> we should add IE6/7 to migrate testing as well
[09:06:01] <m_gol> tests are short so they should cope
[09:06:09] <DaveMethvin> it won't take long, agreed
[09:06:13] <m_gol> IMO no need for a separate run
[09:06:14] <m_gol> btw
[09:06:16] <DaveMethvin> not sure i want to know the answer :)
[09:06:24] <m_gol> ;)
[09:06:24] <m_gol> BrowserStack made real devices available :)
[09:06:27] <markelog> weirdly this â€“ https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/effects.js#L1358
[09:06:31] <m_gol> with newer Androids as well
[09:06:35] <m_gol> I need to test it
[09:06:38] <markelog> is keep falling on my local ie10
[09:07:27] <markelog> does anyone has seen the same?
[09:07:33] <markelog> gibson0421?
[09:07:52] <gibson0421> local as in native, or local as in Browserstack?
[09:07:59] <DaveMethvin> i am always having issues with ie changing its zoom and breaking things until i reset it to 100%
[09:08:07] <markelog> native
[09:08:20] <gibson0421> I don't have one to check with
[09:08:32] <m_gol> I have a VM, I can check
[09:08:32] <DaveMethvin> i can check it here, just a sec
[09:08:44] <markelog> DaveMethvin: same for me, but probably it's not it
[09:08:46] <markelog> thanks
[09:09:55] <DaveMethvin> effects runs fine by itself, all green in ie11, but i don't have ie10
[09:10:38] <markelog> also fine in ie9
[09:11:05] <DaveMethvin> whoops, just crashed the new ie11 dev channel :)
[09:11:16] <DaveMethvin> our work is done!
[09:11:36] <DaveMethvin> worked that time
[09:11:55] <DaveMethvin> well that's a pain, i guess ie10 is broken there somehow
[09:12:02] <markelog> btw, i saw in "Dev Leads Meeting 2014-06-11" letter
[09:12:18] <markelog> some things about css framework
[09:12:23] <markelog> how i could talk about it?
[09:12:46] <markelog> *with whom I can talk about it
[09:12:50] <markelog> that is more correct )
[09:13:39] <m_gol> markelog: all green in my IE10
[09:13:51] <DaveMethvin> arschmitz is working on that, i'm sure he could use all the help he could get markelog
[09:14:04] <markelog> m_gol: how many times did you run that test?
[09:14:15] <markelog> okay, great
[09:14:16] <m_gol> markelog: I run the whole suite once
[09:14:31] <markelog> try to run only that test
[09:14:32] <DaveMethvin> does it fail if you just run effects? that's what i did
[09:14:33] <markelog> couple times
[09:14:36] <arschmitz> markelog: yeah any help or questions let me know ill fill you in
[09:14:49] <markelog> DaveMethvin: yep
[09:15:01] <DaveMethvin> ok well at least it seems to work in ie11
[09:15:01] <markelog> it's just faster )
[09:15:03] <markelog> to check
[09:15:06] <m_gol> markelog: same
[09:15:09] <DaveMethvin> agreed!
[09:15:18] <markelog> arschmitz: okay, wil do
[09:15:21] <m_gol> your IE10 is broken :P
[09:15:30] <arschmitz> markelog: im free almost any time just ping me
[09:15:30] <DaveMethvin> which is good news imo :)
[09:15:33] <markelog> m_gol: probably :-)
[09:15:59] <m_gol> probably a weird setting in a weird place having (theoretically) nothing in common with this test :P
[09:16:02] <m_gol> I have a PR for Sizzle: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/267
[09:16:56] <DaveMethvin> i think the rnative was to work around an old Prototype bad shim wasn't it?
[09:17:36] <DaveMethvin> we definitely need to write more of this down :/
[09:19:34] <DaveMethvin> reading thru that pull now
[09:20:59] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil and gibson0421 had concerns about the rnative ... and like i said i vaguely remember that there was a popular broken shim for it
[09:21:54] <DaveMethvin> http://ejohn.org/blog/getelementsbyclassname-pre-prototype-16/
[09:22:18] <DaveMethvin> this has GOT to be pretty low impact tho
[09:22:39] <DaveMethvin> someone would need to be including ancient Prototype and also including the most up-to-datest jquery
[09:22:45] <gibson0421> actually, I'm not married to rnative
[09:23:03] <DaveMethvin> seems like it could be dropped at this point
[09:23:06] <gibson0421> I really don't care about blocking shims
[09:23:42] <DaveMethvin> so is that sizzle pull good to go?
[09:24:24] <gibson0421> verifying now...
[09:25:01] <gibson0421> LGTM
[09:25:52] <DaveMethvin> then lgtm too!
[09:26:25] <m_gol> ok
[09:26:30] <DaveMethvin> so on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1601 what does everyone think of those sneak dependencies?
[09:26:58] <DaveMethvin> it *could* be refactored to make everything explicit but really a mess to do i'd think
[09:27:50] <DaveMethvin> oh, backing up a bit, markelog can you take a look at the script problems with android 2.3?
[09:28:08] <markelog> yep, already on my radar
[09:28:19] <DaveMethvin> awesome
[09:28:25] <m_gol> ideally we'd rely on explicitly passing what's needed and only exposed everything on the jQuery object because that's the API
[09:28:27] <markelog> but if i remember correctly, m_gol wanted to take a look
[09:28:30] <m_gol> but we shouldn't rely on that internally
[09:28:39] <m_gol> yeah, I'll look into it
[09:28:45] <markelog> allrighty than
[09:28:48] <m_gol> I was mainly waiting for markelog's commit to be merged
[09:28:53] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[09:28:55] <m_gol> to re-check
[09:28:58] <gibson0421> the quick-and-dirty fix would be to comment that ../../selector provides jQuery.contains
[09:29:12] <DaveMethvin> always the pragmatist, that gibson0421
[09:29:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and probably should have that comment
[09:29:26] <DaveMethvin> we do the same in a few other places
[09:29:56] <DaveMethvin> but granularity that would let us express this explicitly would be a real mess IMO
[09:30:24] <DaveMethvin> if someone wanted to tackle it i'd be interested to see it, but it could be a suicide mission
[09:30:37] <DaveMethvin> all that work just to kill it
[09:32:14] <DaveMethvin> just looking through the other pulls ... any that need discussion here?
[09:33:38] <DaveMethvin> this looks like plugin to me http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15148
[09:33:50] <gibson0421> +1
[09:36:12] <DaveMethvin> damn spammers
[09:36:20] <DaveMethvin> we need email validation before you can post
[09:36:54] <DaveMethvin> and we need a faster bug tracker
[09:37:40] <DaveMethvin> thoughts on this one? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15097
[09:38:00] <DaveMethvin> it's a shortcut prop but usually we can get those
[09:38:07] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, no
[09:38:10] <DaveMethvin> nevermind
[09:38:15] <DaveMethvin> only set those
[09:38:31] <m_gol> yeah, we talked about it
[09:38:42] <m_gol> some browsers treat it just as a shorthand, some not only
[09:38:43] <timmywil> we have no documented behavior for that.
[09:38:49] <m_gol> and gCS doesn't work on shorthands
[09:39:09] <gibson0421> "Retrieval of shorthand CSS properties (e.g., margin, background, border), although functional with some browsers, is not guaranteed. For example, if you want to retrieve the rendered border-width, use: $( elem ).css( "borderTopWidth" ), $( elem ).css( "borderBottomWidth" ), and so on."
[09:39:14] <gibson0421> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[09:39:17] <m_gol> exactly
[09:39:37] <timmywil> I thought this was about .css()
[09:39:41] <timmywil> with no args
[09:39:54] <timmywil> and it's not, ok
[09:40:06] <gibson0421> `.css('animation')`
[09:40:12] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:40:29] <DaveMethvin> and there are individual props like animation-name etc
[09:41:01] <DaveMethvin> i often wonder what the heck people are doing who are grabbing all this stuff anyway
[09:41:05] <DaveMethvin> but i am afraid to ask
[09:41:20] <DaveMethvin> YOUR USE CASE IS INVALID, GOOD DAY SIR!
[09:41:22] <timmywil> in that case, I'd vote for leaving it to the browser to return a proper concatenation of values.
[09:41:56] <DaveMethvin> we'd need some other api to get those values
[09:42:23] <DaveMethvin> there are all those non-gCS things like "used value" etc
[09:42:38] <DaveMethvin> i think we have a ticket for that
[09:42:53] <DaveMethvin> aaaanyway
[09:43:31] <DaveMethvin> i've been ignoring this one: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14723
[09:43:37] <DaveMethvin> anybody have some time to look into it?
[09:43:53] <DaveMethvin> i think the problem was that the *default* style is always border-box
[09:44:06] <DaveMethvin> but it's been a while
[09:44:09] <markelog> afk
[09:45:20] <timmywil> I'm in trac loading land.
[09:46:09] <DaveMethvin> spammers won't leave trac alone, we get maybe 100 registrations per week that are totally bogus
[09:46:31] <DaveMethvin> and sometimes they hammer the server with 1 or 2 attempted spam posts every *minute*
[09:47:38] <DaveMethvin> ugh, have to leave ... i'm catching a plane to las vegas
[09:48:30] <DaveMethvin> i'll see  you guys later, thanks!
