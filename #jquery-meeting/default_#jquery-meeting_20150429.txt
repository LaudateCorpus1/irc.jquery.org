[09:01:17] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:30] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer: Anything to discuss for button?
[09:02:04] <arschmitz> well it needs a few PR's to land
[09:02:30] <arschmitz> the form one, the classes assert one and the one your working on thats waiting on the form stuff for reset
[09:02:45] <arschmitz> the first and last ones remove like half of the code in checkboxradio lol
[09:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> We still have the 1.9 git build on the CDN.
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection to removing it
[09:04:12] <arschmitz> nope
[09:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone else want to chime in on that?
[09:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go ahead and remove if we don't hear any objections by the end of the meeting.
[09:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's not serving any purpose.
[09:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so this is fun....autocomplete handling for focus and hover.
[09:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> A never-ending source of debate :-)
[09:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> Right now we treat hover and focus exactly the same.
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> I believe the awesome bar used to do this as well.
[09:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what we based our interactions on.
[09:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't do that today.
[09:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> Which seems like better UX.
[09:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> I think we tried to match the new behavior and screwed it up.
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> In 1.8.x, if you hovered, the text input would update.
[09:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> In 1.9.x, we changed it so that no longer happened.
[09:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> But we still mark the hovered item as active.
[09:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> Which means if you hover, then press enter, the item is selected.
[09:09:22] <scott_gonzalez> This is also the source of the accidentally selected item in Firefox bug that we work around right now.
[09:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> Where you click into the text input, move the mouse down, type something, suggestions appear, the mouse is now over the suggestions and an item is highlighted.
[09:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> We detect this scenario and then blur the item instantly.
[09:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> And the main reason for this is to prevent typing then pressing enter from selecting a hovered item that the user didn't interact with.
[09:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> If we no longer let hover mark an item as active, then we wouldn't need to work around it.
[09:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> All of the browsers are about to implement that behavior.
[09:11:38] <arschmitz> sounds reasonable
[09:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> The behavior I'm talking about is easy to understand if you look at http://dev-test.nemikor.com/behavior/mouseover-when-element-is-shown.html.
[09:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we're missing a lot of people today.
[09:12:39] <arschmitz> seems it
[09:12:49] <arschmitz> didnt this come up on the pointer events list?
[09:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> A related topic came up.
[09:13:08] <arschmitz> general behivor not autocomplete specificly
[09:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> About what events occur when pointer capture is released and the mouse is over an element other than the previously capturing element.
[09:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> That's what sparked this.
[09:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> I got into a discussion of how the Firefox behavior is the best behavior, but users get mad about it.
[09:14:41] <arschmitz> figured
[09:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> And then figured out that we should just change how autocomplete works.
[09:17:23] <mikesherov> here
[09:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> OHAI
[09:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> Can you read the backlog and weigh in on the 1.9 git and autocomplete?
[09:22:16] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Would you mind extending this sentence a little? "All of the browsers are about to implement that behavior."
[09:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> This behavior: http://dev-test.nemikor.com/behavior/mouseover-when-element-is-shown.html
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> The one that Firefox has.
[09:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> Meaning this block will apply to every browser soon: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/autocomplete.js#L260-L273
[09:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> But if hovering doesn't active, and only highlights, then that block can go away.
[09:23:45] <fnagel> Ahh ok, thanks!
[09:24:03] <mikesherov> I agree with scott_gonzalez
[09:24:13] <mikesherov> I'm not sure hovering should activate
[09:24:19] <mikesherov> weird ux
[09:24:29] <arschmitz> yup^^
[09:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel mikesherov: Any objection to dropping 1.9 git from the CDN?
[09:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have git builds for any other old version.
[09:26:55] <fnagel> Silly question: "All of the browsers are about to implement" -- is this for sure and how long will it take?
[09:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> This was only useful during the long 1.9/1.10 dev phase
[09:27:06] <mikesherov> Drop away
[09:27:10] <mikesherov> is anyone using it?
[09:27:18] <mikesherov> Like do actual users rely on it?
[09:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt anyone's using it in production.
[09:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably check.
[09:27:45] <mikesherov> would be good to know if we had access logs or something?
[09:27:53] <mikesherov> I'm not opposed, just curious
[09:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping infra about it.
[09:28:12] <mikesherov> kk
[09:28:14] <fnagel> Checking the logs sounds like a good idea
[09:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, it may be in splunk.
[09:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> Dylan is still working on the tooltip research. He's blocked on getting a JAWS update.
[09:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> That should be resolved this week, so he'll be able to continue working on it.
[09:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> I've made some progress on selectmenu max-height, but CSS is hard.
[09:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to pair with someone on that.
[09:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically, I'm having trouble with aligning the icon with the bottom of the menu.
[09:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> `bottom: 0` apparently means the bottom of the visible section.
[09:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> So it scrolls away as the menu scrolls.
[09:32:51] <arschmitz> i can try to help
[09:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it would behave more like a fixed position element within the scrollable area.
[09:33:09] <mikesherov> is it abspos?
[09:33:12] <mikesherov> or relative?
[09:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> absolute
[09:33:38] <mikesherov> that *is* weird
[09:33:54] <mikesherov> well, maybe it's absolute to wrong element then
[09:34:09] <mikesherov> like maybe it's direct parent needs to be static?
[09:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/49d4a4b75063a2aaa66e
[09:35:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so is this an item in the menu?
[09:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's on the same level as the items.
[09:35:53] <scott_gonzalez> But it's not an item itself.
[09:36:05] <arschmitz> yeah this needs to be in the parent to do what you want
[09:36:12] <arschmitz> outside the scrollable region
[09:36:17] <scott_gonzalez> But then the styling is wrong.
[09:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be below the element that has the background color and border.
[09:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it does make sense that it scrolls away though.
[09:37:26] <scott_gonzalez> It just didn't seem like it would when I implemented it.
[09:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> Since that's the difference between absolute and fixed.
[09:37:40] <arschmitz> i dont think there is a cross browser way to do what you want
[09:37:45] <arschmitz> you want position:sticky
[09:37:49] <arschmitz> which does not really exist
[09:37:55] <arschmitz> execpt in chrome i think
[09:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I'll have to try that just to see if it works.
[09:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'll ping you later today or tomorrow about it.
[09:38:32] <arschmitz> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky
[09:38:44] <arschmitz> safari only i guess
[09:38:49] <arschmitz> and firfox i mean
[09:38:55] <arschmitz> :-p
[09:39:15] <arschmitz> but yeah ping me and we can try and figure something out
[09:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the tooltip focus/click ticket...
[09:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12380
[09:39:31] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone think we should change anything here?
[09:39:59] <arschmitz> i think it would actually be wrong to change anything
[09:40:34] <arschmitz> though the page for the ticket loading would be awesome
[09:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh. MySQL keep spiking to 1200% CPU within a few minutes of restarting.
[09:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> Give me a minute.
[09:42:51] <arschmitz> thats a lot of percents 8-(
[09:43:02] <arschmitz> i got it to load though
[09:43:30] <arschmitz> the aria recommendations seem pretty clear here though
[09:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> Quick, load the page.
[09:43:41] <arschmitz> lol
[09:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, and the reporter even finally came around and acknowledged that this is not nearly as simple as what he thought.
[09:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> Even though I told him that multiple times before he filed the issue.
[09:46:37] <arschmitz> regardless of what others do the recomendation is open on focus only closes on esc or focus out
[09:48:25] <arschmitz> so to do anything else by default would seem wrong. And as far as adding options we have always been pretty firm we wont add options to disable accessability features
[09:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll close the ticket.
[09:50:15] <arschmitz> the only thing would be an extension point but from what i gather he can already work around it so not needed
[09:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:51:59] <fnagel> FYI: I've started working on the Calendar / Globalize PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1341
[09:51:59] <fnagel> Rebase on latest datepicker branch is almost done. Fixing Unit Tests and demos will be next.
[09:52:33] <scott_gonzalez> great :-)
[09:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
