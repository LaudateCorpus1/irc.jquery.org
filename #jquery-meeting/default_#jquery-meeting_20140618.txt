[08:30:43] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle leobalter
[08:31:28] <jzaefferer> yay, testing meeting time
[08:31:37] <jzaefferer> If you didn't find the link in the topic: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FbWhiFQ9gWQvB1Tm4QM_OC4me-ha2ujDWH5sdF7ueo/edit
[08:31:47] <jzaefferer> I filled out a few things already
[08:32:36] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: anything from your end?
[08:32:45] <jzaefferer> Looks like we're missing the other two
[08:33:03] <JamesMGreene> I was looking through the open PRs, hoping to jump in but I was a bit lost as to the status of some of them
[08:33:20] <JamesMGreene> e.g. #588 and #540
[08:34:06] <jzaefferer> Okay. I think Leo is still working on #588 and Benjamin Tan (d10) is still on #588
[08:34:45] <jzaefferer> You could look into our "throws" assertion, there's a bunch of related issues. https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/579 and ...
[08:34:53] <JamesMGreene> Yeah #540 (d10) hasn been quiet for a few days longer than expected
[08:35:03] <jzaefferer> these two https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/593 https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/595
[08:35:19] <JamesMGreene> Sounds good
[08:35:30] <jzaefferer> #540 has been open for so long, I think we can wait for a few more days
[08:36:36] <jzaefferer> You could also tackle the remaining items in https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/582 - jscs update with new jQuery preset landed in 1.5.x and grunt-jscs-checker 0.5 is out, which upgraded to 1.5
[08:37:32] <jzaefferer> If those aren't deep enough, there's always our best friend, the diff module: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues?labels=diff&page=1&state=open
[08:37:43] <JamesMGreene> OK
[08:38:04] <JamesMGreene> For starters, I've assigned the 1 `throws` PR and 3 `throws` Issues to myself
[08:38:05] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/348 and https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/483 should have a relatively limited scope
[08:38:08] <JamesMGreene> We'll go from there
[08:38:11] <jzaefferer> okay, great
[08:38:51] <jzaefferer> I'm still working on jQuery UI 1.11 final, until that is done I'll stick with reviewing issues and PRs and barely writing anything myself
[08:39:02] <jzaefferer> Writing upgrade guide is so much fun!!1
[08:39:48] <jzaefferer> I'll chat with Leo when he's around again.
[08:40:10] <jzaefferer> Since he and Timo aren't here, we can go back to whatever we were doing
[08:40:12] <jzaefferer> Thanks James
[08:40:29] <JamesMGreene> np
[08:40:38] <JamesMGreene> Looking forward to getting back into it
[08:46:31] <jzaefferer> Yeah
[09:00:17] <jzaefferer> jQuery UI Meeting Time! Ping arschmitz gnarf kborchers mikesherov petersendidit rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:00:24] <rxaviers> Hi jzaefferer
[09:00:26] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:00:35] <kborchers> hey
[09:01:09] <jperrault> o/
[09:01:13] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: wanna start with DB??
[09:01:18] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:54] <rxaviers> Woops. I have no update for DB this week.
[09:02:29] <jzaefferer> Are you working on the jqueryui.com update?
[09:03:55] <rxaviers> I've been in San Diego this week and I couldn't focus on it this week. But, I certainly will.
[09:05:36] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:06:23] <jzaefferer> Nothing on Globalize then either?
[09:06:45] <rxaviers> I've been working on #251
[09:07:10] <rxaviers> I see there are comments from you that I still need to read.
[09:07:19] <jzaefferer> Anyone with some bower experience is welcome to review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1271
[09:07:24] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:08:07] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: I was just on the phone with Felix, he can't make it to this meeting. He said you have at least a workaround for the selectmenu / menu padding issue?
[09:08:54] <jzaefferer> meanwhile, arschmitz anything on button?
[09:09:04] <tj_vantoll> Yep, I need to do some testing but it should be an easy change.
[09:09:16] <tj_vantoll> I still don't understand the underlying issue though.
[09:09:22] <arschmitz> sorry no no time again been completely taken up by getting mobile 1.4.3 out and css framework stuff
[09:10:12] <tj_vantoll> The code itself is fine, but it'd be nice to get that cleaned up soon. I'll get to it this week.
[09:10:15] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: ah, that sucks. May ping mikesherov?
[09:10:27] <jzaefferer> *maybe
[09:10:49] <tj_vantoll> Yeah. I'll write up what I've found.
[09:10:55] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:11:15] <jzaefferer> On Datepicker, Felix said he's making progress on fixing unit tests after the calendar split
[09:11:43] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I met with him on Skype and we worked through the existing tests.
[09:11:49] <jzaefferer> He would like to me with some team members, probably me and TJ to discuss some of the API changes, specifically which options to keep, change or remove
[09:11:52] <tj_vantoll> The datepicker suite is running now post split.
[09:12:42] <jzaefferer> Cool
[09:13:12] <jzaefferer> As for 1.11, last I talked with Scott the plans was to release the final next Monday, 23rd. We'll see how that goes
[09:13:23] <jzaefferer> I've been working with TJ on the upgrade guide, that's coming together quickly
[09:13:29] <tj_vantoll> Are we going to do an RC?
[09:14:23] <jzaefferer> I'd rather not
[09:14:30] <jzaefferer> Not sure what Scott thinks about that
[09:15:09] <jzaefferer> That reminds me, I haven't checked splunk stats for DB in a while
[09:15:12] <tj_vantoll> I would agree that it's unnecessary.
[09:15:38] <jzaefferer> 1625 beta 2 downloads
[09:15:49] <tj_vantoll> Wow, not bad actually.
[09:16:04] <arschmitz> yeah that sounds pretty good
[09:16:23] <jzaefferer> In the same period we still had a lot more 1.9.2 downloads, but I think this is still pretty good
[09:16:51] <tj_vantoll> I think it's enough at least.
[09:17:06] <jzaefferer> Yeah
[09:17:06] <arschmitz> yeah i mean if 1600 people tested in theory with as few issues as were reported that sounds pretty encouraging
[09:17:25] <tj_vantoll> As for the upgrade guide, I'll be back on that later today.
[09:17:27] <jzaefferer> Its good that we found the bower issue (dunno where the report came from)
[09:17:48] <jzaefferer> There shouldn't be too much left in the upgrade guide
[09:17:57] <tj_vantoll> Excellent
[09:18:06] <jzaefferer> Though it would be good if you could also make a pass through the changelog to see if I missed something
[09:18:29] <tj_vantoll> Will do
[09:19:30] <jzaefferer> I'll wait with the bower fix another day to see if I can get some feedback from timmywil. Otherwise we can just land that anyway
[09:19:45] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good.
[09:19:49] <jzaefferer> It fixes the issue for the end user and doesn't make much of a difference for us
[09:21:05] <jzaefferer> I think that's all. Thanks everyone!
