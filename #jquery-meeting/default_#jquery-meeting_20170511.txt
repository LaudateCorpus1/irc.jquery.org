[12:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> __bethge__ hey
[12:02:41] <__bethge__> Hi!
[12:02:57] <__bethge__> I feel like my bouncer died ... along with my virtual server.
[12:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> That's a shame.
[12:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> We could get you on the jQuery bouncer if you'd like.
[12:03:59] <__bethge__> Oh, that would be great, if it is not too much work.
[12:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, I'll ping someone from the infrastructure team after the meeting.
[12:04:49] <__bethge__> Great, thank you
[12:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> So, we released v0.4.3 https://github.com/jquery/PEP/releases/tag/0.4.3 :-)
[12:05:37] <__bethge__> Yeah! \o/
[12:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> I believe that puts us back to improving test coverage.
[12:06:43] <__bethge__> Afraid so. The w3c has been pretty busy
[12:06:49] <__bethge__> *group
[12:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything specific to discuss today?
[12:09:23] <__bethge__> Nope. I will look into my PRs and try to update them accordingly
[12:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[12:11:58] <__bethge__> Alrightly talk to you soon! Thank you for looking into the bouncer things!
[12:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> Do you happen to know anything about the stylus support in iOS?
[12:12:48] <__bethge__> oh sorry. uhm, afraid not
[12:13:08] <__bethge__> The iPad Pro is the only device that has one, right?
[12:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> perhaps
[12:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> Might need to go to the Apple Store at some point to do some testing.
[12:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> Not a high priority for me.
[12:15:16] <__bethge__> Hehe
[12:15:59] <__bethge__> I will be in Berlin next weekend and mean to head to the Apple Store anyways. I can check out some basic behaviour
[12:16:25] <__bethge__> Actually, its the weekend after next
[12:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if you don't have time, don't worry about it.
[12:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> There's one pretty close to me that I can get to.
[12:18:37] <__bethge__> Ah, ok. That sounds easier
[12:19:18] <__bethge__> Still, toying around with it is always fun :-D
[12:21:01] <__bethge__> I would be heading out for some dinner
[12:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, well I think we're done.
[12:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> (Sorry, got pulled away by a coworker)
[14:01:57] <apsdehal> Hi
[14:02:15] <arschmitz> hi
[14:02:27] <arschmitz> looks like no one else is here
[14:02:41] <arschmitz> but we released the blog and tweeted earlier today
[14:02:43] <apsdehal> yeah, last week cogwurx was here, but channel was on mute
[14:02:56] <apsdehal> yay, awesome
[14:02:58] <apsdehal> Finally
[14:03:16] <arschmitz> so now we just need to work on bugs
[14:03:18] <apsdehal> next to next week I will also get time to work on the issues people have filed
[14:03:22] <arschmitz> that come in or have already
[14:03:46] <arschmitz> and baring anything major we can do beta ASAP
[14:03:55] <apsdehal> Yeah, some of them have been filed specifically for 1.5
[14:04:09] <apsdehal> There was an issue that download builder is not working for 1.5
[14:04:55] <apsdehal> http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[14:05:05] <apsdehal> It gets stuck when I select 1.5-alpha option
[14:05:22] <apsdehal> Console shows CORS issue
[14:06:27] <apsdehal> Well, I guess download builder is not working for any of the version not just 1.5
[14:06:56] <arschmitz> yeah looks like the service is down
[14:07:00] <arschmitz> ill ping infrastructure
[14:07:24] <apsdehal> Also, @arschmitz I guess we can close that issue with link to blog post
[14:07:45] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8546
[14:21:46] <arschmitz> yup ill do it
[14:31:05] <cogwurx> do what?
[14:31:19] <arschmitz> close issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8546
