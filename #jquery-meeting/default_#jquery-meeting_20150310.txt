[10:01:17] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[10:01:38] <michaelarestad> Hi
[10:01:41] <imaffett> Hello
[10:02:01] <trailofdad> ahoy
[10:02:26] <sfrisk> Meeting Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:02:54] <sfrisk> Also for anyone unaware of it, previous meeting notes can be found at: http://meetings.jquery.org/category/chassis/
[10:03:33] <arschmitz> hi
[10:05:27] <sfrisk> So I went through last week and added labels to most of the issues to hopefully make it a bit clearer what issues align with which phase of the project
[10:05:49] <sfrisk> To help make it a bit clearer on where our next steps are going to be for Phase One
[10:07:15] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[10:07:51] <sfrisk> Also, I'm glad to announce that the file structure PR and issue is finally complete
[10:08:07] <arthurvr> Great!
[10:09:11] <sfrisk> and the first part of performance testing has been committed, with geekman-rohit, prasunanand and others stepping up to help add other components and frameworks to the testing suite
[10:09:24] <sfrisk> others actually might be arschmitz
[10:10:19] <geekman-rohit> Oh gosh, I am late, anything important I missed?
[10:10:37] <sfrisk> Not really, here's the agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:11:02] <geekman-rohit> It was 11:30 pm for me last week, day light savings or something??
[10:11:13] <trailofdad> yeah
[10:11:21] <sfrisk> Daylight savings is annoying
[10:11:27] <sfrisk> yay for US doing it before everyone else!
[10:12:17] <geekman-rohit> thanks for resharing the agenda for me
[10:12:23] <sfrisk> No problem!
[10:13:35] <sfrisk> Okay, so I'm going to skip around on this agenda a bit
[10:13:49] <sfrisk> Since it makes more sense to discuss next steps for phase one
[10:14:19] <sfrisk> For those of you unaware of it, here is the basic draft roadmap for Chassis: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/wiki/Chassis-Roadmap
[10:15:28] <sfrisk> Phase One will be focusing on the CSS Framework parts, so now that the file structure has landed
[10:15:38] <sfrisk> we can start on what next needs to get done for that
[10:16:03] <sfrisk> michealarestad, when you have a chance, could you do a PR for the base typography idea you had?
[10:16:18] <michaelarestad> Yep. Gladly.
[10:16:24] <sfrisk> Awesome
[10:18:26] <sfrisk> I've created an issue for semantic color variable names
[10:19:01] <sfrisk> which has resulted in a lot of suggestions for color names: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/43
[10:20:12] <samat123> Do suggested variable names have to be improved or completed?
[10:21:20] <arschmitz> samat123: discussed would be the start :-)
[10:21:28] <sfrisk> We could probably use more color variables than I listed, I'll admit I went super simplistic with the list I wrote
[10:21:34] <sfrisk> mostly to get the discussion going
[10:21:38] <prasunanand> sfrisk, when can we start working on grid system
[10:21:50] <sfrisk> I'll get to that issue, prasunanand
[10:22:04] <prasunanand> hmm
[10:22:16] <arschmitz> i think we should stay "fairly" simplistic on collors
[10:22:31] <trailofdad> I still think that we should have a gray scale and about 5 default colors to use for modules.
[10:22:35] <samat123> sfrisk: I wrote some suggestions for variable names at https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/43 What do you think about it?
[10:22:38] <sfrisk> I would say I would go with less rather than more variable names
[10:22:40] <arschmitz> because different states will likely not be something that is excludeable since it will be used by everything else
[10:24:14] <sfrisk> Might hit up isaacdurazo to see if he has some suggestions for base colors to use
[10:25:13] <sfrisk> as our defaults, especially since I'll admit, I do not always have a great eye for color
[10:25:32] <trailofdad> well, the blue from the logo is quite nice
[10:25:36] <trailofdad> as were the other colors
[10:26:24] <sfrisk> Yeah, but he might be able to help us figure out what colors to use for elements on the screen
[10:27:33] <sfrisk> samat123: I do like some of your suggestions, especially for link color states, but I don't know if we need that many variables
[10:27:34] <prasunanand> I think semantic-ui have done  it perfectly : eight base colors and idea of flat buttons
[10:28:11] <prasunanand> *9 base colors
[10:28:50] <samat123> I did not mean to use all the variables - rather only the ones we need. I meant only to show the pattern
[10:28:56] <sfrisk> ah, okay
[10:29:02] <sfrisk> in that case, yes, I agree with the battern
[10:29:56] <trailofdad> what are peoples thoughts on the scale of grays?
[10:30:00] <sfrisk> pattern*
[10:30:01] <arschmitz> prasunanand: semantic ui is MASSIVE and bloated i think
[10:30:18] <arschmitz> prasunanand: it is the largest of all css frameworks in filesize by a factor of 3
[10:30:19] <samat123> I think if we are sure we will have more or less the same color scheme we can use scale of gray.
[10:30:32] <sfrisk> I'm not necessarily a fan of scales of grays, mostly because it lacks semantic meaning, but I'm willing to listen to other opinions
[10:31:03] <geekman-rohit> we can always achieve any shades of grey with lighten and darken in sass
[10:31:23] <prasunanand> sfrisk, Thats right ; It provides a lot of variations for a component .
[10:31:50] <samat123> Otherwise if gray color will have to be changed to, for example, shades of blue. I think using something like $gray-dark would not be convinient.
[10:31:51] <arschmitz> i would like to see some colors
[10:31:53] <arschmitz> not JUST grey
[10:32:04] <prasunanand> yep
[10:32:23] <sfrisk> mostly because we want Chassis to be pretty customizable, and easy to adapt to whatever color pallet a developer is working from
[10:32:51] <trailofdad> I suppose it would be handy but not nessisary. I meant a gray scale + colors 5 or 6 would be a good number imo
[10:32:54] <arschmitz> we need a decent but not excessive number of base colors
[10:33:00] <arschmitz> for people to be able to customize in the first place
[10:33:20] <sfrisk> yeah, I just would avoid calling the variables by the name of their color
[10:34:25] <arschmitz> yup
[10:34:27] <samat123> Also, what do you think about using "chassis" in the variables as trailofdad proposed? Personally, I think $color-primary is more clear that $chassis-primary
[10:35:36] <sfrisk> I'm indifferent at the moment of the use of "chassis" in the variable name
[10:35:44] <arschmitz> it seems odd to me
[10:36:00] <arschmitz> in the bootstrap port it makes sense because your porting something
[10:36:25] <samat123> Yeah, I agree with that
[10:36:32] <arschmitz> but i don't see where we need to worry about scooping collisions in css vars unless im missing something?
[10:36:36] <sfrisk> but I'm not sure why 'chassis' would need to be used vs 'color' in the variable name
[10:36:38] <trailofdad> I was using it as a placeholder - should have been more clear. I just like that it doesn't seem bloated
[10:37:19] <arschmitz> well actually once css variables are a real thing this might matter
[10:37:30] <arschmitz> i need to look at the spec for this i think
[10:38:07] <sfrisk> hrmm, good point
[10:39:56] <sfrisk> okay so I'm leaning towards a naming scheme similar to what samat123 suggested
[10:40:40] <samat123> Are there some suggestions to improve $color-primary $color-text etc. ? I think it is a good balance between descriptiveness and succinctness
[10:40:45] <arschmitz> yes i like that just not sure if we need to care about scoping or not
[10:40:55] <sfrisk> and see if I can come up with some placeholder colors we can use, unless someone has a better idea for color pallets
[10:43:55] <sfrisk> Okay, so on the list of other things that need to get done for phase one include:
[10:44:00] <samat123> Thanks. My suggestions were rather based on how the vars were named on official styleguide. However personally I also think they are great
[10:44:48] <sfrisk> typography ( with a pr to be covered by michaelarestad), tables, form elements, form validation, any extra helper classes we need, and finally grid
[10:45:39] <sfrisk> I would argue that in general, I find Grid to be at the bottom of this priority list of things that need to get done, mostly because it would be helpful to have other elements in place to test any grid systems we might consider
[10:45:42] <michaelarestad> Sorry, I'm a bit distracted, but i wouldn't use chassis in a variable name. We could easily scope our variables or use maps.
[10:46:09] <michaelarestad> I might use it in a map like $chassis-colors:();
[10:46:54] <michaelarestad> Anyway, it's worth being an issue if it isn't already. I've been chewing on that for a bit.
[10:47:37] <sfrisk> add your thoughts to https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/43 michaelarestad?
[10:47:49] <michaelarestad> Will do.
[10:47:58] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: is there support for maps planned in the spec?
[10:48:00] <sfrisk> I had a rather simplistic list to start with just to get the ball rolling
[10:48:32] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: Not sure yet. Not sure I even think maps is favorable yet for variables.
[10:49:00] <michaelarestad> They're awesome to have, but a bit tedious to write map-get( $map, thing )
[10:49:03] <arschmitz> ok so css varibles are global
[10:49:29] <michaelarestad> I wasn't refferring to CSS variables. Sass variables and maps.
[10:49:47] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: i know but we have always said we wanted to stick with things that are in the spec
[10:50:14] <michaelarestad> Got it. I still would avoid CSS variables, in that case.
[10:50:23] <arschmitz> so that once support exists we can pretty much change .scss to .css and be done with it and drop sass
[10:51:01] <michaelarestad> CSS variables won't replace Sass variables. They're awesome for say switching to a dark theme via ambient light media query.
[10:51:21] <michaelarestad> But not for setting your base colors if the color scheme doesn't change dynamically.
[10:52:39] <sfrisk> the way css variables are declared are different than scss
[10:52:40] <sfrisk> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables
[10:52:53] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:53:24] <arschmitz> yeah scss does not fully follow spec but my understnading is they wanted to move towards it in the future
[10:53:46] <michaelarestad> Yep. <3 that about Sass.
[10:53:59] <sfrisk> well then we shall watch and see what they do
[10:54:10] <arschmitz> so i dont think we need to concern ourselves with details
[10:54:17] <arschmitz> but varibles will be a thing
[10:54:22] <arschmitz> so varibles are fine to use
[10:54:29] <arschmitz> just general concepts like that
[10:54:39] <sfrisk> but aside from color variable names that somehow took up most of our time, I think some good next steps are the typography, form elements, form validation, and other basic html4 styling
[10:54:43] <arschmitz> the spec is far from stable at this point
[10:54:46] <samat123> Yes. As far as I understand we can use SCSS when we need to change something and use CSS when the change is done.
[10:57:05] <trailofdad> sfrisk - agree
[10:57:34] <geekman-rohit> foem validation? wouldnt that be javascript turf?
[10:57:37] <geekman-rohit> form*
[10:58:07] <sfrisk> the CSS for the form validation
[10:58:20] <geekman-rohit> the color codes? classes etc. ??
[10:58:27] <sfrisk> so if you added an input-error class on an input field, it would style the input to show an error
[10:58:35] <sfrisk> or set the label to an error color, etc
[10:58:37] <geekman-rohit> understood
[10:58:53] <sfrisk> kinda like this: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-validation
[10:59:15] <geekman-rohit> yup, used that
[10:59:18] <prasunanand> what about tables. and panels ?
[10:59:47] <arschmitz> panels are a widget and way later phase
[11:00:01] <sfrisk> I already listed tables up above and created an issue for it
[11:00:02] <arschmitz> they fall under ui-toolkit
[11:00:14] <sfrisk> tables are covered under html4/5 elements that need some basic styling
[11:00:36] <samat123> sfrisk: At issues #9 and #10 about form styling I was also thinking about styles like on Bootstrap
[11:01:28] <sfrisk> yeah, similar to bootstrap in a lot of ways.  Most of what I want to avoid that bootstrap does is the reliance on cascading elements
[11:01:52] <sfrisk> so for example their text blocks depend on the .has-error class being in the div around it
[11:02:22] <sfrisk> rather than changing a class on the form control itself
[11:03:13] <samat123> Yes. Is there something what should be styled in somewhat distinctive manner compared to bootstrap? Or it is just the div?
[11:03:55] <sfrisk> so we're going with a BEM naming convention, so the idea is that you would have one class on any element
[11:04:03] <sfrisk> and that would determine all the styling
[11:04:12] <arschmitz> also we want to keep markup structure as loose as possible
[11:04:17] <sfrisk> Bootstrap is very dependent on cascading and how your format your markup
[11:04:31] <arschmitz> this will be important to get the best possible adoption from js frameworks
[11:04:41] <samat123> Yeah, I agree
[11:05:13] <prasunanand> but only one class would force the developer to write more SASS/
[11:06:18] <samat123> I think it is a worthwhile effort :)
[11:06:30] <sfrisk> it also has proved to be better performance
[11:07:29] <arschmitz> prasunanand: devs wont write any scss / sass if they dont want to
[11:07:45] <geekman-rohit> I prefer not to, if I a using a framework already
[11:08:49] <prasunanand> Got it
[11:09:09] <prasunanand> was confused :)
[11:09:41] <sfrisk> Okay, it's past 2, and I know I personally need to get back to work
[11:09:58] <sfrisk> didn't quite get into all the topics I wanted us to get into, but there is always next week
[11:10:24] <sfrisk> for this week, focus on the Phase One stuff (typography, variables for colors, html4 elements, form elements, form validation)
[11:10:34] <samat123> prasunanand: I think it is the best think from the end user perspective: to think what would be the best and then to implement it
[11:10:58] <sfrisk> validation styling might involve some discussion regarding naming conventions
[11:11:10] <samat123> sfrisk: is there someone already warking on forms? I would like to try to work on issues on #9 and #10
[11:11:54] <sfrisk> as of right now, no one is working on forms
[11:12:12] <prasunanand> Even I am wondering about how we are going to work and who is concerned with what?
[11:13:25] <samat123> Alright, then I will work on the forms and will report my progress at #css-chassis and/or github comments
[11:13:28] <sfrisk> although I would like a little more discussion on form elements at least - on how we might want to implement inline vs block forms
[11:13:51] <sfrisk> labels inline vs labels being treated as a black above the input
[11:14:14] <prasunanand> we can create classes like form-control in bootstrap
[11:14:32] <geekman-rohit> we should keep the inline label as flexible as possible
[11:14:38] <sfrisk> definitely
[11:14:43] <geekman-rohit> some forms may have big labels
[11:14:44] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit
[11:14:54] <geekman-rohit> that is a pain in bootstrap
[11:14:59] <sfrisk> which means making the inputs ability to deal with the labels flexible
[11:15:07] <samat123> Where and when could we discuss it? I also think it would be great to have a better understanding what we want exactly with the forms
[11:15:11] <geekman-rohit> yep, exactly
[11:15:44] <sfrisk> Okay, so it's 2:15, like I said I need to get to work, take the discussions back to the issues
[11:15:45] <geekman-rohit> and the user(developer) specifying size of the label
[11:15:50] <sfrisk> I'll post the meeting notes later tonight
[11:15:55] <sfrisk> or discussions back to #css-chassis
[11:16:02] <sfrisk> but I'm muting this room for now
[11:16:22] <sfrisk> see everyone back in #css-chassis
