[12:00:17] <bethge> hi
[12:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, look...

[12:00:54] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> I finally figured out how to update it. I feel like b-ot is constantly changing.
[12:01:18] <bethge> yay :D
[12:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody from Microsoft has shown up in quite a while.
[12:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll email Jacob about it.
[12:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> bethge's PR was merged :-) https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/256
[12:03:55] <arschmitz> woo
[12:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> Did you end up reaching out to snover about leadfoot?
[12:05:03] <bethge> Didn't get to it. I asked around the week before about iOS and he did help me out with the settings on the intern side of things, but the driver did not play along
[12:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:05:44] <bethge> last weekend i stabbed at it with chromedriver + android sdk but didn't get deep enough into it
[12:06:54] <bethge> when you use chromedriver, you just start the bin as an executable, did I get that right?
[12:08:53] <bethge> On OSX the chromedriver bin just throws errors, not sure if they support osx directly
[12:09:04] <arschmitz> it always worked for me
[12:09:12] <arschmitz> previously anyway
[12:09:18] <arschmitz> and im on osx
[12:09:36] <arschmitz> i am getting failures now when i went back to my branch running it from grunt though
[12:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you run `chromedriver --port=4444 --url-base=wd/hub` and then it should start up.
[12:10:06] <bethge> Ok cool, then it's just me
[12:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's no good, because a) I have no idea how to debug chromedriver issues; b) This could be happening for others and we just don't know.
[12:11:53] <bethge> There is still option c) : I am just doing something terribly wrong
[12:12:12] <bethge> ;)
[12:12:13] <arschmitz> i have debugged chrome driver a bunch
[12:12:27] <arschmitz> but let me see if i can get grunt working again and if that works for you
[12:12:45] <arschmitz> because that at least eliminates user error mostly
[12:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Think you'll have time to work on that this week?
[12:13:57] <arschmitz> i started looking into it again this week
[12:14:20] <arschmitz> yeah i am already just need to finish it up think i have it figured out
[12:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:16:27] <arschmitz> chromedirver is a pain but its almost always somethign simple and stupid
[12:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: Was that list of tests that you added (commented out), the complete list?
[12:16:46] <bethge> I think so
[12:16:56] <bethge> should be 64, I believe
[12:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I was thinking maybe we should close https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/170 and open new issues for small batches of related tests.
[12:17:57] <arschmitz> i think that makes more sense
[12:18:04] <arschmitz> something we can actually work though and close
[12:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> We've been breaking them up in PRs anyway. This would make it easier for someone to claim ownership of a set and not worry about duplicated efforts.
[12:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> I can double check to make sure that list is complete and then file issues for them.
[12:19:04] <bethge> That sounds good
[12:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll even commit to one of the batches for next week.
[12:20:54] <bethge> nice :)
[12:21:51] <bethge> btw. some tests are for mouse, touch and pen, should we do tests for all the input devices? (once we have touch and pen)
[12:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> If we can, we should.
[12:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> Because that's the only way we can really ensure that we're handling all the paths correctly.
[12:24:32] <bethge> yeah ... I imaged you would say that
[12:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> I can file an issue for us to go back through the tests and see which ones should run multiple times.
[12:24:53] <bethge> fun fun fun, tests tests tests :D
[12:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/257
[12:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's everything for tests.
[12:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else to discuss today?
[12:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[14:01:57] <arschmitz> agcolom: apsdehal: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: sfrisk: meeting time
[14:02:04] <jasperdegroot> hola
[14:02:19] <cogwurx> hello!
[14:02:31] <arschmitz> cogwurx: hello!
[14:03:02] <cgack> howdy
[14:05:20] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=1983914725
[14:05:27] <arschmitz> ok so big news this week
[14:05:34] <arschmitz> UI beta finally officially was announced
[14:05:46] <arschmitz> and as of about 2 minutes ago i just published out blog update
[14:05:59] <jasperdegroot> problems with API docs solved?
[14:06:00] <arschmitz> so every one quick tweet it
[14:06:13] <arschmitz> yeah it was the download builder that was the blocker for a while now
[14:06:32] <apsdehal> Hi
[14:06:59] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do you send a tweet from the @jquerymobile account?
[14:07:00] <arschmitz> but since we are talking about that once ui 1.12 stable is out scott will be concentarating on fixing the download builder and helping out getting it to work for mobile and that will be his concentration for a big
[14:07:15] <arschmitz> not yet logging in now i lterally just published the blog
[14:07:39] <cogwurx> haven't seen the tweet yet
[14:07:53] <cogwurx> ah...there it is
[14:09:53] <gabrielschulhof> Hey! Sorry I'm late!
[14:11:56] <arschmitz> ok
[14:12:02] <arschmitz> so in regular business
[14:12:15] <arschmitz> i reviewed table
[14:12:21] <arschmitz> and am half way through panel
[14:14:03] <arschmitz> as for failing table tests on 1.5-dev
[14:14:08] <arschmitz> those are fixed in the table branch
[14:14:17] <arschmitz> but there is 1 failing test in all core versions still
[14:14:23] <arschmitz> so that should be easier to fix
[14:14:39] <arschmitz> panel is looking good so far just small things
[14:14:56] <arschmitz> table was also pretty much mostly small things
[14:15:05] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: any update on selectmenu
[14:15:17] <cgack> arschmitz: I can't reproduce any errors on my table branch using any jqueries, any tips
[14:15:24] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah. I finally got the tests to be green again, but it's still slow going.
[14:15:26] <arschmitz> hrm
[14:15:54] <gabrielschulhof> I'm still using pagehide on page though, so I need to move away from that.
[14:15:55] <arschmitz> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/103908456
[14:16:22] <arschmitz> getting an undefined element somewhere in that test
[14:16:41] <arschmitz> its an actual error not just a failing test so should be easy to reproduce
[14:16:48] <arschmitz> maybe you have something not pushed?
[14:17:12] <cgack> i'll double check
[14:18:35] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:18:42] <cgack> nope, all clear, plus i just pulled the branch down on another machine and 1.9.1 is green, checking others now
[14:18:51] <arschmitz> weird
[14:19:00] <arschmitz> every version is failing on travis with same error
[14:19:32] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: you did a lot fo the work on that anything stand out to you?
[14:19:35] <cgack> well the git version is different and I can reproduce that
[14:19:51] <arschmitz> odd
[14:20:19] <cgack> but that is in transitions unit tests
[14:20:42] <cgack> anyway, I'll go through your review this week and maybe it'll work itself out on travis
[14:20:53] <arschmitz> 2 fails in 2.1
[14:21:08] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Just that it's very fragile.
[14:21:09] <arschmitz> both for element undefined though
[14:21:17] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, wait, you don't mean selectmenu.
[14:21:22] <arschmitz> no table
[14:21:36] <gabrielschulhof> Looking ...
[14:21:45] <arschmitz> it might be a async issue
[14:22:33] <gabrielschulhof> So, it's not reproducible locally, even with phantomjs?
[14:22:47] <arschmitz> so git has no table fails but does in transitions
[14:22:50] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, I just ran into such an exception that was happening in phantomjs but not in Chrome.
[14:23:00] <arschmitz> 1.x fails 1 table test
[14:23:05] <arschmitz> 2.x fails 2 table tests
[14:23:53] <gabrielschulhof> The only way of tracing that is to use try {} and console.log() and to submit to travis. Yuck!
[14:24:30] <gabrielschulhof> ... and the stack traces phantomjs produces are useless.
[14:24:36] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:24:38] <gabrielschulhof> I doubt that's coming from table_core.js
[14:24:51] <arschmitz> cgack: well just see what you can trace down with it
[14:24:59] <arschmitz> hopefully you can get it to happen local at least
[14:25:20] <cgack> i'll keep trying to break it :)
[14:25:27] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else?
[14:25:29] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Hang in there ...
[14:25:46] <arschmitz> cgack: if you get stuck feel free to ping me and ill try and dig in
[14:25:57] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: If you end up submitting repeatedly to travis, turn things off in .travis.yml
[14:26:05] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Like, all non-essential suites and stuff.
[14:26:32] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: You can even say grunt connect:server qunit:http to skip directly to the tests.
[14:26:53] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Like, grunt --suites=table connect:server qunit:http
[14:26:58] <arschmitz> you could even make it just run the suite you want too
[14:27:00] <arschmitz> yeah exactly
[14:27:45] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Yeah, turn things off, push a branch to jquery/jquery-mobile, and run travis repeatedly for that branch.
[14:27:50] <arschmitz> iv had luck before just bogging down my machine to reproduce too
[14:28:16] <arschmitz> like run the tests in like 6 different tabs at once while watching video and photoediting lol
[14:28:38] <arschmitz> try to simulate the load on travis a bit
[14:28:40] <cgack> haha, VisualStudio usually does enough to bog this machine down
[14:28:49] <cgack> but yeah, i'll tinker around
[14:29:21] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[14:29:32] <gabrielschulhof> Reminds me of Petzold: https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~ygu/petzold/ch20e.htm
[14:29:35] <arschmitz> ok any one have anything else?
[14:29:51] <gabrielschulhof> for (i = 0 ; i < REP && pparams->bContinue ; i++) A = tan (atan (exp (log (sqrt (A * A))))) + 1.0 ;
[14:30:04] <gabrielschulhof> But anyway ...
[14:30:26] <gabrielschulhof> Nothing else here ...
[14:31:27] <arschmitz> ok
[14:31:37] <arschmitz> ill see everyone back on -dev then
