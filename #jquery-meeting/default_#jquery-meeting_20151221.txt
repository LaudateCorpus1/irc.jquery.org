[12:00:21] <timmywil> Happy Christmas!
[12:00:32] <DaveMethvin> yay! same to you!
[12:01:04] <timmywil> I hope markelog arrives to update us on 1.12
[12:01:21] <DaveMethvin> i agree on the data and dashes issue, would be good to make that consistent
[12:01:31] <DaveMethvin> would that be considered a breaking change tho?
[12:01:40] <DaveMethvin> i guess it's broken in one or the other :)
[12:01:55] <timmywil> Dunno, the inconsistency problem could make it a bug fix
[12:02:02] <gibson042> this ^
[12:02:14] <gibson042> it's not a breaking change; just a fix of particularly insidious bugs
[12:02:22] <timmywil> :)
[12:02:33] <timmywil> I've got a blog post up
[12:02:41] <timmywil> Feel free to edit
[12:02:55] <timmywil> and add anything you'd like noted
[12:02:59] <DaveMethvin> k, i'll read through it a bit later
[12:03:39] <timmywil> I'll go through the api issues today. will probably make a 1.12/2.2 branch and cherry-pick stuff from the 3.0 branch
[12:04:01] <timmywil> gibson042: you ready for a Sizzle release today?
[12:04:11] <gibson042> yeah, I think so
[12:04:17] <timmywil> sweet
[12:04:25] <gibson042> I ended up fighting with the CI last week, but local testing is good
[12:04:34] <markelog> hey, sorry i'm late, couldn't connect to irc for some reason
[12:04:39] <timmywil> markelog: np
[12:04:46] <timmywil> markelog: how's 1.12 coming?
[12:05:08] <timmywil> In order to release wed, I think we'd need something pushed today
[12:05:10] <markelog> it was busy week, but i think i will finish tomorrow
[12:05:30] <timmywil> ok, that's cutting it close
[12:05:38] <markelog> will do my best
[12:05:50] <markelog> are you drafting the blog post?
[12:06:10] <timmywil> yea, you should see it in your email
[12:06:19] <timmywil> also in the notes https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BadwSO6Sn91RBfr05s77r81ncEi0oMBJ5mZS-k215vg/edit#
[12:06:33] <markelog> just got it
[12:06:35] <markelog> yeah
[12:06:47] <markelog> cool!
[12:07:22] <markelog> i can hit you with email, as soon as i'm done
[12:07:40] <timmywil> I understand being busy, but I want a thorough review of 1.12 before release, so we may have to delay.
[12:07:58] <markelog> i hope i will not get to that
[12:08:08] <markelog> but we should do what we must
[12:08:14] <timmywil> yea, not saying we will right now.
[12:08:28] <timmywil> if you let me know when you've got something, I'll review asap.
[12:08:36] <markelog> cool, will do
[12:08:54] <timmywil> cool
[12:09:16] <timmywil> gibson042: this isn't pressing, but how's show/hide coming?
[12:09:23] <timmywil> as pressing :)
[12:10:09] <gibson042> I dug in in earnest a bit over the weekend... I'm making progress, but more slowly than I hoped
[12:10:24] <gibson042> it'll be full steam after this Sizzle release and couple of docs PRs
[12:10:35] <timmywil> cool
[12:10:42] <m_gol> present, sorry for being late
[12:11:02] <timmywil> m_gol: hey!
[12:11:04] <markelog> on the sizzle btw
[12:11:11] <markelog> i see you commit escape
[12:11:24] <markelog> but it seems you missed my comment in the pr?
[12:11:53] <gibson042> checking now...
[12:11:57] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/364#discussion_r44823884 ?
[12:12:07] <markelog> yeah
[12:12:16] <markelog> we discussed it in the previous meeitng
[12:12:21] <markelog> but not fully
[12:12:30] <markelog> as comment is more detail
[12:13:15] <gibson042> I didn't use native CSS.escape because it's just extra code here, and the spec itself resolved NULL handling
[12:13:37] <gibson042> as for exposing in the jQuery API, I'm in favor but we need to settle on a name
[12:13:50] <markelog> would you mind posting it on the github, so it would be documented?
[12:13:56] <gibson042> posting what?
[12:14:02] <markelog> your response
[12:14:09] <markelog> to the comment
[12:14:10] <gibson042> sure
[12:14:13] <markelog> cool, thanks
[12:14:15] <timmywil> jQuery.escapeCSS?
[12:14:35] <markelog> if there would something more, i think we could talk about it in the there
[12:14:41] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1761
[12:14:45] <timmywil> sounds good
[12:14:54] <markelog> fyi https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2766
[12:15:16] <markelog> seems, like it could be dup
[12:15:16] <gibson042> oops ;)
[12:15:35] <markelog> not sure how to qualify it :-)
[12:15:41] <m_gol> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1761 "Has Pull Request"? I don't see one
[12:15:50] <gibson042> shall it be a blocker?
[12:15:59] <markelog> i guess it means pr to sizzle?
[12:15:59] <timmywil> m_gol: I did that in reference to the Sizzle PR
[12:16:12] <markelog> seems easy enough for 3.0
[12:16:17] <m_gol> ah, ok. I guess the markelog issue may be considered separate then
[12:16:33] <gibson042> no, I guess we should use 1761
[12:16:43] <gibson042> that's the original jQuery ticket
[12:16:54] <markelog> either way is good to me
[12:17:03] <timmywil> sure
[12:17:15] <m_gol> k, but then we don't have the PR yet as the "expose" part needs to be done
[12:17:16] <markelog> that is just bureaucracy anyhow
[12:17:22] <m_gol> true
[12:17:40] <timmywil> Still need a name, tho
[12:17:46] <markelog> so yeah, we can close the second ticket
[12:17:50] <markelog> and remove the label
[12:17:50] <gibson042> done
[12:17:56] <timmywil> gibson042 just did
[12:18:16] <gibson042> shall we shoot for a name here, or in the PR?
[12:18:34] <timmywil> As long as we don't forget
[12:18:46] <gibson042> PR, then
[12:18:51] <timmywil> ok
[12:19:45] <timmywil> For 2779, it sounds like we're in agreement. Add a fix for data + hyphens in 2.2.0.
[12:20:14] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2779
[12:20:26] <markelog> another commit for 2.2 right?
[12:20:31] <timmywil> right
[12:20:31] <markelog> but not in 1.12
[12:20:42] <timmywil> yea, 1.12 is okay, I think
[12:20:57] <markelog> added a label
[12:21:03] <timmywil> cool
[12:21:17] <timmywil> Finally, DaveMethvin updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2737
[12:21:24] <m_gol> markelog: wrong label :)
[12:21:29] <m_gol> 2.x-only, not 1.x-only
[12:21:40] <markelog> fixed
[12:21:43] <markelog> thanks
[12:21:46] <m_gol> np
[12:22:07] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I like the hook idea, but was wondering if we need to store the return value.
[12:22:24] <DaveMethvin> we have to if we want to only show it at exception time
[12:22:31] <DaveMethvin> because we have to store it before the setTimeout
[12:22:52] <timmywil> yea, my thought was we could make it separate: a verbose mode of sorts.
[12:23:01] <timmywil> meh, maybe not
[12:23:08] <DaveMethvin> it will be way too verbose
[12:23:25] <timmywil> yea, nvm
[12:23:39] <DaveMethvin> i want to build a plugin to do the stack tracing but the hook allows for that without a lot of bulk
[12:23:42] <timmywil> the process object seems as good a place as any
[12:24:35] <timmywil> We can wait to land until you've got a plugin that works with it, if you like
[12:25:04] <timmywil> In case you discover more necessary changes.
[12:25:06] <DaveMethvin> i guess there's no hurry since its 3.0
[12:25:10] <DaveMethvin> we have a little more time for that
[12:25:13] <timmywil> right
[12:25:20] <DaveMethvin> so yeah let it sit
[12:25:26] <timmywil> ok
[12:25:49] <timmywil> and markelog: you came in after, but I pointed out that I'll get to 1.12/2.2 api issues today
[12:26:03] <timmywil> anything else?
[12:26:05] <markelog> what api issues?
[12:26:14] <timmywil> making sure stuff is documented
[12:26:21] <markelog> oh yeah, cool
[12:26:30] <markelog> just waited for "anything else?"
[12:26:31] <timmywil> you asked about it last week, wanted to ease your mind
[12:26:37] <markelog> to ask that question :-)
[12:26:48] <markelog> thank you timmywil
[12:26:48] <timmywil> :)
[12:27:17] <timmywil> thanks everybody! I'll be available in -dev.
[12:27:26] <timmywil> have a happy holiday
[12:27:35] <markelog> see ya
