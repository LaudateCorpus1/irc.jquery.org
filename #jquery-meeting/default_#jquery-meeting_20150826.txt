[09:00:38] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:43] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I've seen some recent discussion on button again. What's the status of that?
[09:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> Still mostly just waiting on me?
[09:03:15] <arschmitz> it needs to be rebased once https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1589 lands
[09:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:03:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: did a review of things i changed
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait for that.
[09:03:51] <arschmitz> i can do it quickly once 1589 lands probably
[09:04:01] <arschmitz> but im pretty much gone next week
[09:04:08] * rxaviers on standby
[09:04:18] <jzaefferer> hi
[09:04:27] <arschmitz> starting new job and going to costa rica
[09:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I've only scanned through it, but the JSCS update looks good.
[09:07:13] <arschmitz> i did add one inine comment
[09:07:20] <arschmitz> to datepicker for jscs
[09:07:29] <arschmitz> i didnt want to blow up the pr
[09:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> That's fine. All of that code will get replaced anyway :-)
[09:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> And when we merge this into the datepicker branch, we'll just run the fix task again.
[09:08:16] <arschmitz> it would have also been a manual fix i didnt want to dea with ha ha
[09:08:35] <arschmitz> it was not something that could be done with --fix
[09:08:44] <arschmitz> it was variable naming
[09:09:20] <arschmitz> was not worth the effort in datepicker but i did it everywhere else
[09:11:06] <arschmitz> So the only rule we dont comply with is the 100 char limit now
[09:11:21] <arschmitz> that will be a lot of work unless someone writes a plugin for auto fixing
[09:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's not worth it.
[09:13:03] <arschmitz> my thought exactly
[09:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Anything to discuss for datepicker?
[09:13:09] <arschmitz> its like 900 errors lol
[09:13:17] <fnagel> There is a new PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1590
[09:13:25] <fnagel> If merged, tests are green again!
[09:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO!
[09:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> Is it still a WIP as the title suggests or is it ready for a full review/merge?
[09:14:08] <fnagel> What needs to be discussed is cldr data handling, thing we did't agree on anything last time
[09:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad rxaviers just disappeared.
[09:14:51] <fnagel> It's ready for a  merge. WIP just because it's a lot of small bugs, but nothing connected.
[09:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> When rxaviers is around again, let's try to schedule a meeting to discuss cldr.
[09:16:30] <fnagel> Sounds good.
[09:17:16] <fnagel> FYI: next thing I will try to address is the messed up focus handling. Propably a tough one.
[09:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well once we land this PR, we can probably get some help from Deque.
[09:18:28] <fnagel> Ahh, and I changed some text (you wrote?!) from the wiki page, section "Globalize related"
[09:19:14] <fnagel> Fixed statements about what localization.js contains (onyl cldr, no more localization for widget itself) and added a paragraph about we now have a labels option (for these localization data).
[09:19:46] <fnagel> These changes have been made when rxaviers updated the Globalize implementation of Calendar.
[09:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> When was this mousewheel stuff added?
[09:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> Do we need to discuss any of it this week or was it all handled previously?
[09:23:07] <arschmitz> uh i think it was just about bumping the version
[09:23:20] <arschmitz> since we are dropping support for older core
[09:23:53] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: "we can probably get some help from Deque." ?
[09:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> Birkir Gunnarsson has been asking about datepicker a lot.
[09:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> And I keep telling him that we've got some merging/cleanup to do before he can do any real testing and help out.
[09:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> So once we land this PR, we can probably get help from him and possibly others at Deque.
[09:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> We got a new ticket about npm/CJS: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14375
[09:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure what we should be doing here, or how this user plans to use jQuery UI inside node.
[09:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> Without knowing the toolchain, I'm not sure that we should be doing anything.
[09:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> Because the last thing I want to do is create one-off solutions to very large community problems.
[09:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm wondering if we should just close this as a duplicate of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11101
[09:29:08] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well webpack is not really using it in node
[09:29:16] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: it bundles all your css imgs js
[09:29:41] <arschmitz> it sounds like it expects a main field to conform to npm standards
[09:29:56] <jzaefferer> I'm fine with closing as duplicate; so far there's nothing on the ticket justifying it to stay open
[09:29:58] <arschmitz> browserify is similar but only handles js i think
[09:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> But how do you use webpack to include just one widget from UI?
[09:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't use webpack at all.
[09:30:12] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Please mention the wiki todo section as there still quite a few known bugs and missing features. Focus handling as the biggest issue atm.
[09:30:17] <jzaefferer> rxaviers now has some experience with webpack
[09:30:21] <arschmitz> i have not either i only started looking into them like today lol
[09:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'd really hate making a change and deploying it just to find out that it doesn't even help.
[09:30:51] <arschmitz> i agree but from what i understand there is a change to be made we just need to figure out what
[09:30:58] <jzaefferer> publishing as-is to npm to let people do whatever they want with files in node_modules/jquery-ui seems useful to me
[09:31:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i think what they are expecting is something similar to
[09:31:36] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.js
[09:31:51] <arschmitz> or a built dist one of the 2
[09:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> Surely someone using webpack doesn't want a built dist of the entire collection.
[09:32:33] <arschmitz> no but webpack expects a main file
[09:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but is that main file useful for getting to the things you actually care about?
[09:32:59] <arschmitz> thats the part im not sure about
[09:33:54] <jzaefferer> jquery-ui is similar to mout, which also has no main file (or main entry point); you just require the individual module you need: http://moutjs.com/ for example: var map = require('mout/array/map');
[09:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> In the last comment, they mention `var autocomplete = require('jquery-ui/ui/autocomplete');` which implies knowing the source directory structure.
[09:34:16] <jzaefferer> the same should work for jQuery UI: require("jquery-ui/widgets/autocomplete")
[09:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> If main points to the ui directory, that would work in node.
[09:34:44] <rxaviers> does browserify or webpack complains of packages missing a main entry?
[09:34:48] <rxaviers> complain*
[09:34:59] <scott_gonzalez> Probably, if index.js doesn't exist.
[09:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> Since it won't have an entry point that actually works.
[09:35:19] <arschmitz> i think just like a node module it expects SOMETHING there
[09:35:45] <arschmitz> and resolves similarly looking for an index the name of the package etc
[09:36:09] <jzaefferer> we need a demo app with webpack and browserify to actually test both scenarios
[09:36:21] <arschmitz> yeah i agree
[09:36:40] <arschmitz> it seems sane to support in some way at this point but i dont know what the right way is
[09:36:58] <arschmitz> do we know anyone from webpack lol to just ask them :-)
[09:37:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i bet if you tweet the issue at them you will get a response
[09:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> I've never talked to Tobias before.
[09:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> Do you think Kristofer Joseph would do it?
[09:39:19] <rxaviers> I've talked to Tobias and Juho at gitter.im
[09:39:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im sure if i ask him he will
[09:39:30] <rxaviers> Juho is more accessible
[09:40:00] <jzaefferer> I have to go, ttyl
[09:40:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's try one of them. Either Juho through rxaviers or Kristofer through arschmitz.
[09:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, who's Juho?
[09:41:18] <arschmitz> no idea
[09:41:57] <rxaviers> webpack guy
[09:42:00] <arschmitz> Juho Vepsäläinen
[09:42:07] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> Interesting, doesn't show up on https://github.com/webpack/webpack/graphs/contributors
[09:43:12] <rxaviers> well, at least he is active in the channel and helped me with a couple of questions while implementing globalize demo using webpack
[09:43:30] <arschmitz> seems to be an author
[09:43:35] <arschmitz> like books
[09:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ok, good enough.
[09:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you reach out to him about this?
[09:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> I think that might be better than Kristofer, since he's usually pretty busy.
[09:44:32] <rxaviers> sure, about http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14375 right?
[09:44:38] <arschmitz> yeah if we dont get an answer ill try Kristofer
[09:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: yup
[09:45:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:45:50] * rxaviers has pinged Juho about it
[09:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[09:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.

[10:00:11] <agcolom> `content
[10:00:51] <agcolom> @arthurvr @AurelioDeRosa
[10:00:56] <agcolom> meeting time.
[10:00:59] <agcolom> @kswedberg
[10:01:08] <kswedberg> hey @agcolom
[10:01:13] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone!
[10:01:16] <agcolom> I'm not sure who's around :-) holiday time....
[10:01:21] <agcolom> Hey Karl!
[10:01:27] <agcolom> Hi Aurelio!
[10:02:02] <AurelioDeRosa> How is it going?
[10:02:24] <agcolom> great. Except I'm not enjoying the London monsoon ;-)
[10:02:47] <agcolom> so I guess arthurvr added something in the notes
[10:02:49] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:03:04] <AurelioDeRosa> Today is really crazy, but that's English summer I guess.
[10:03:05] <agcolom> about globalizejs.com and the api site
[10:03:53] <agcolom> I haven't had a chance to catch up with Arthur so I don't know what the status is.
[10:04:49] <agcolom> let me ask rxaviers...
[10:05:22] <kswedberg> rxaviers has been busy with the docs lately, but I haven't seen arthurvr lately
[10:05:28] <rxaviers> Hey guys. No work has started for any of the sites
[10:05:50] <agcolom> rxaviers: thanks
[10:06:06] <rxaviers> kswedberg, arthurvr thanks for the continued help reviewing the docs btw
[10:06:14] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you for the update @rxaviers
[10:06:28] <kswedberg> rxaviers: you're doing an awesome job
[10:06:57] <agcolom> I agree!!!
[10:07:22] <rxaviers> phew
[10:07:23] <rxaviers> tks
[10:07:28] <agcolom> ok, so I guess that's something we should keep on and start work with.
[10:09:19] <AurelioDeRosa> Is anything we discussed in our previous meetings that needs an action?
[10:10:09] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: did you get the browserstack account?
[10:11:04] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, I have. It's my fault to haven't had the chance to work on it as I wanted. Sorry about that.
[10:11:18] <AurelioDeRosa> I've worked on fixing some issues though
[10:11:45] <AurelioDeRosa> I had the final rush for the book about jQuery that goes live in 5 days
[10:11:47] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: no problem. I had to cancel so many meetings because of clashes with work that I've forgotten
[10:11:54] <agcolom> what book??
[10:12:03] <agcolom> congrats btw
[10:12:46] <AurelioDeRosa> jQuery in Action, third edition (the one in the footer of the website)
[10:13:04] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: were you working on fixing issues with breakpoints on the main jquery site?
[10:13:11] <agcolom> (I noticed one issue)
[10:13:42] <agcolom> several issues actually...
[10:14:22] <agcolom> to do with the download icon coming over the text on the iPad mini (but cannot reproduce on a desktop browser)
[10:14:43] <AurelioDeRosa> If you mean this one (https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/issues/102) I've fixed it
[10:15:01] <AurelioDeRosa> Anyway, there are other issue to fix I guess
[10:15:27] <agcolom> yes, Maybe the easiest will be to open issues?
[10:15:30] <AurelioDeRosa> *issues
[10:15:45] <agcolom> I can do that either later today or tomorrow.
[10:16:20] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, definitely. But as I wrote in the group I'm on holiday from Friday.
[10:16:22] <agcolom> the other one is the tiled area getting funny width at certain widths
[10:16:53] <agcolom> yes. so I'll open the issues so we know... I'll see also if they are easy to fix...
[10:17:04] <agcolom> it may just be some incorrect maths?
[10:17:47] <AurelioDeRosa> Might be, but need further investigation. Anyway, if you see something wrong, I'll fix as soon as I come back from holiyday
[10:19:27] <agcolom> great, thanks!
[10:19:50] <agcolom> I don't really have anything else to discuss as we're only just coming back from holiday...
[10:20:27] <AurelioDeRosa> I think pretty much many people are on holiday now or are just coming back.
[10:20:58] <agcolom> yep. Do you have anything else to discuss?
[10:21:22] <agcolom> otherwise, I think this may be it for this week...
[10:22:17] <AurelioDeRosa> In regard of involving other people in jQuery, is there anything that we can do?
[10:23:51] <agcolom> Maybe Greg can help. I'll speak to him on tuesday
[10:24:19] <AurelioDeRosa> Great.
[10:25:08] <AurelioDeRosa> I've tried to receive help on this issue (https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/796) but it'd be lovely to have more people that help us.
[10:25:09] <agcolom> ok, so I guess we're good for this week?
[10:25:20] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, I think we're fine.
[10:25:28] <agcolom> oh, yes, I saw that
[10:25:44] <agcolom> it'd be great
[10:27:01] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes. Well, I think that's it for this meeting.
[10:27:32] <agcolom> yes. Thanks everyone. Hopefully we will have more to report in Sept :-)
