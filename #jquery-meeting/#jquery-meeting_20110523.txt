[08:59:16] <JohnResig> Hello everyone!
[08:59:21] <JohnResig> We'll be getting started in a minute
[08:59:54] <JohnResig> ajpiano, louisremi, jitter, scott_gonzalez, gnarf, kswedberg: meeting time!
[09:00:03] <nimb> teste
[09:00:04] <ajpiano> wooooooooo
[09:00:13] <louisremi> Hi!
[09:00:15] <nimb> o/
[09:00:18] <nimb> hi
[09:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: I don't have the 1.7 voting UI in Trac
[09:00:30] <nimb> you speak portuguese?
[09:00:39] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: it's hooked in to your trac username
[09:00:46] <nimb> muito bom
[09:01:11] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: so in your case "scott.gonzalez"
[09:01:25] <ajpiano> JohnResig: we just double checked the perms and it's just not showing up for him :/
[09:01:29] <stevben> $('#irc).html('"hello");
[09:01:33] <joasssko> spanish?
[09:01:39] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: did you shift + reload the page?
[09:01:45] <ajpiano> nimb, joasssko, no, the meetings are conducted in english :)
[09:01:45] <JohnResig> to make sure the old file isn't being cached?
[09:01:47] <gnarf> forced refesh / clear cache?
[09:01:53] <nimb> Ok
[09:01:56] <nimb> no problem
[09:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> whoa, it shows up in the report?
[09:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> not on the individual tickets?
[09:02:32] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: both
[09:02:32] <ajpiano> it shows up in both places
[09:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't get it on tickets
[09:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> I've tried several browsers
[09:03:18] <gnarf> wacky!
[09:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> including ones that have never been to Trac
[09:03:25] <gnarf> brb coffee
[09:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> just noticed that it shows up in the report when I expand the ticket
[09:03:51] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: can you give me an HTML dump of one of your ticket pages?
[09:03:56] <JohnResig> not sure what could be going on
[09:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: https://gist.github.com/255445ddb90226adc98a
[09:06:19] <jzaefferer> I had some trouble restoring my old account, current trac username for me is now "jzaefferer" - is that on the list for the voting tool?
[09:06:19] <gnarf> so https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/ -- right? :)
[09:06:34] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: no
[09:06:35] <jzaefferer> I guess not, as I don't see any of the voting stuff
[09:06:56] <JohnResig> ok everyone, let's get started: http://bit.ly/i3vsit
[09:06:56] <ajpiano> adding you now, jzaefferer
[09:07:43] <AdrianoSouza> sorry i change my nickname
[09:07:55] <ajpiano> seems like we're pretty locked in... just keeping an eye out for 1.6.2 potential blockers, and get votes in on 1.7 features
[09:08:07] <ajpiano> when do we want to get 1.7 voting done by, next monday?
[09:08:50] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: ah, it's failing on that one page because it has multiple keywords, and I didn't plan for that, I think
[09:08:57] <JohnResig> ajpiano: I suspect so
[09:09:05] <svizion> morning
[09:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: ah, ok
[09:09:20] <JohnResig> ajpiano: although we're not in a huge rush, so we could even take two weeks
[09:09:29] <ajpiano> ok
[09:09:41] <ajpiano> ultimately, it's just the 1.7-discuss tag that makes the difference
[09:09:56] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: oh, I take that back, it's working for me here in Chrome
[09:09:58] <addyosmani> It would be nice to have a little more time to provide feedback. More than a week would probably ensure we can review all of those 80+ tickets.
[09:09:58] <ajpiano> so if new enhancements/features come in in that time, we can just tag them and get 'em reviewed if necessary?
[09:09:59] <timmywil> 9300 > 7557.  Working on a solution for 9300.  Should just be a reordering of sorts.  The pull for it is not viable.
[09:10:12] <JohnResig> ajpiano: actually no
[09:10:24] <JohnResig> ajpiano: well, hmm
[09:10:38] <JohnResig> I think we should set a hard cap on the features
[09:10:46] <JohnResig> not let new ones bubble in
[09:11:14] <ajpiano> i am fine with that like, after everyone's voted, but if we close it now
[09:11:29] <danheberden> i agree - unless it's one that captivates us all and we all want to see it in like really bad
[09:11:31] <ajpiano> that means if you have an idea for jquery feature, you're waiting until like, early 2012 to see it land, best case...
[09:11:40] <JohnResig> ajpiano: isn't that the point, though?
[09:11:48] <gnarf> ajpiano: is that such a bad thing?
[09:11:56] <JohnResig> we had the form open for a couple weeks, we got the submissions, we closed the form - we're done now
[09:12:18] <gnarf> I missed out on the 1.6 cycle ;) -- I wasn't offended...
[09:12:20] <ajpiano> i think we should just use a bit of discretion in case someone has like some brilliant eureka moment. but generally yes, closed.
[09:12:22] <danheberden> plus we could do an accellerated 1.8 if necessary
[09:12:25] <addyosmani> +1 danheberden and JohnResig.
[09:12:43] <danheberden> ajpiano ya thats what i mean - like someone gets us all excited in -dev
[09:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> why do blocker bugs get pushed and voted on?
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> example: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8468
[09:13:31] <ajpiano> hm?
[09:13:48] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: why not?
[09:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> if we acknowledge that it's a blocker bug, there shouldn't be voting
[09:14:05] <DaveMethvin> it's fixed now
[09:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> it should be automatically high priority
[09:14:18] <DaveMethvin> wasn't it an opera bug tho?
[09:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> does that matter?
[09:14:31] <JohnResig> sure - but someone still has to fix it and we still have to dedicate the resources to fix it
[09:14:41] <JohnResig> if we don't have the resources, then we can't fix it - regardless of how blocker it is
[09:15:22] <timmywil> I think it'll have to take a back seat to the attribute changes
[09:15:24] <JohnResig> ajpiano: the report will only show stuff tagged with 1.7-discuss now, so yeah, if new stuff pops up, add that keyword
[09:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> so bugs can get deprioritized by committers deciding they only want to work on features?
[09:15:50] <ajpiano> well this goes back to scott's point that blockers be blockers, we have to find ways to fix them
[09:16:07] <JohnResig> timmywil: do you want to sit down with me and work on the sizzle attribute stuff?
[09:16:17] <timmywil> JohnResig: gladly
[09:16:22] <JohnResig> timmywil: it shouldn't be that bad, given the new attr architecture
[09:16:26] <ajpiano> at the very least, we should probably separate 1.7 "bug fixes" from 1.7 features, instead of having them all in one list
[09:16:39] <ajpiano> (once we've distilled the list a bit)
[09:16:43] <timmywil> JohnResig: it'll be nice to have that dried up
[09:16:44] <ajpiano> seems like most bugs are getting unanimous +1
[09:18:01] <JohnResig> the point of voting on the blockers is that they're, previously nominated by just one person as being a blocker - we use this opportunity to determine if it should remain a blocker (and be fixed) or if not, get bumped down to a lower priority
[09:18:15] <JohnResig> or in the case of feature/enhancement requests - either land it or close the bug as wontfix
[09:18:37] <danheberden> also, sometimes fixing a blocker has cons instead of just pros - slower performance, affects something else, etc
[09:18:41] <danheberden> voting makes sense in that regard
[09:19:00] <paul_irish> ajpiano: is there a report view of vote results sorted by votes?
[09:19:03] <timmywil> and some blockers are more important than others
[09:19:10] <ajpiano> i don'
[09:19:11] <timmywil> if we have to choose
[09:19:13] <ajpiano> t think so
[09:19:16] <JohnResig> paul_irish: not yet, I'm working to implement it, it'll require scraping a ton of pages
[09:19:21] <paul_irish> k
[09:20:34] <JohnResig> ok, so voting should be done by June 6th
[09:20:43] <JohnResig> that'll be when we have the final meeting
[09:21:17] <JohnResig> then we'll have this summer to work on the release
[09:21:32] * danheberden gets ready to play 'the final countdown' prior to that meeting
[09:21:36] <JohnResig> jQuery Conf is on Octobter 1st
[09:21:49] <JohnResig> we could do the realease on Friday September 30th
[09:21:53] <danheberden> this release feels like it'd be earlier than that
[09:22:10] <JohnResig> that gives us four months to work on the code
[09:22:11] <danheberden> or are we slowing town release cycles
[09:22:11] <ajpiano> i would love it if like, we were done with "features" by the end of august
[09:22:20] <JohnResig> danheberden: we're slowing down a little bit
[09:22:20] <danheberden> why 4 months?
[09:22:21] <ajpiano> so we had all of september just for QA and a long RC
[09:22:27] <DaveMethvin> and writing docs
[09:22:31] <ajpiano> etc.
[09:22:34] <JohnResig> danheberden: and to co-incide with the conf
[09:22:35] <danheberden> ajpiano DaveMethvin +1
[09:22:49] <JohnResig> *coincide
[09:22:57] <danheberden> ok - i can get on board with that
[09:22:59] <JohnResig> yeah, I'm fine with that
[09:23:04] <danheberden> i like the idea of time to manage things
[09:23:21] <ajpiano> we should like, shout the 1.7RC from the rooftops
[09:23:34] <danheberden> and, honestly, a realistic timeline/milestone
[09:23:50] <danheberden> jquery17.com yo
[09:24:11] <ajpiano> "jQuery reaches the age of consent [in some places!"
[09:24:17] <DaveMethvin> rated NC17
[09:24:19] <danheberden> haha
[09:24:27] <danheberden> rated RC17
[09:24:36] <danheberden> does that make any sen... no, no it doesnt
[09:25:04] <timmywil> 17 days of...
[09:25:22] <danheberden> timmywil exactly
[09:25:28] <danheberden> though i think we should do it on the learning site
[09:25:41] <ajpiano> now there's a concept
[09:25:41] <danheberden> but that's a whole seperate conversation
[09:25:44] <DaveMethvin> "the summer blockbuster that couldn't be stopped...in a world where $ means more than just money"
[09:25:46] <jgarrido> Where can one find more information on this conference?
[09:26:02] <ajpiano> jgarrido: once we make it public :)
[09:26:10] <addyosmani> speaking of which, it would be nice to arrange more work on the learning site. sep conversation as dan mentions.
[09:26:11] <danheberden> jgarrido make sure the blog's in your rss reader :)
[09:26:13] <ajpiano> we'er still finalising a LOT about it
[09:26:15] <DaveMethvin> jgarrido: i think we're close to making an announcement ... it will be in Boston
[09:26:28] <danheberden> or DaveMethvin's back yard
[09:26:32] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:26:34] <danheberden> he's gonna get a few kegs
[09:26:45] <jgarrido> Excellent! Thanks
[09:26:46] <timmywil> +1
[09:26:51] <ajpiano> addyosmani: sounds good to me, got some good stuff out of the way for working on navigation
[09:27:01] <addyosmani> awesome ajpiano
[09:27:05] <jgarrido> Ill bring the funnel ;)
[09:27:10] <danheberden> JohnResig so we gonna try to set time milestones during these months?
[09:27:28] <danheberden> so all isn't "due" by sept
[09:27:28] <addyosmani> whenever you and dan are available for a sprint, lets work on getting some nice progress there.
[09:27:33] <DaveMethvin> June 6: start .... Sept 1: be done :)
[09:27:40] <danheberden> DaveMethvin >_>
[09:27:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah we'd better set a few milestones
[09:27:54] <ajpiano> i think we will danheberden, once we know what we're working on  ;)
[09:28:03] <danheberden> ajpiano ya - just mentioning it
[09:28:09] <danheberden> so it could, like, be on the june6 meeting notes
[09:28:13] <danheberden> to discuss
[09:28:27] <danheberden> and we can assign like 10 things to ajpiano due june 30
[09:28:34] <DaveMethvin> seconded
[09:28:37] <JohnResig> danheberden: yep
[09:28:43] <danheberden> :D
[09:28:51] <JohnResig> do we really want to do a month long RC?
[09:29:01] <JohnResig> that seems like it might be frustrating to users
[09:29:05] <ajpiano> JohnResig i think we should, given the recent 1.6 experience
[09:29:10] <ajpiano> my thinking is that like
[09:29:11] <danheberden> well what about month long beta/RC
[09:29:14] <JohnResig> we would end up with a lot of people using the RC and not ugrading to final
[09:29:27] <JohnResig> danheberden: isn't that what we do already?
[09:29:28] <DaveMethvin> let's call the rc final 1.7 then
[09:29:31] <ajpiano> wouldn't it be nice if 1.7 could actually be THE 1.7 - instead of 1.7.1
[09:29:34] <DaveMethvin> and put out 1.7.1 and 1.72
[09:29:38] <danheberden> JohnResig 1.6 was like 2.5 weeks of beta/RC
[09:29:39] <DaveMethvin> like we usually do :P
[09:30:02] <danheberden> the hard thing is getting people to use/test it
[09:30:05] <danheberden> until it's "1.7"
[09:30:06] <DaveMethvin> honestly it's just human nature for ppl to not get serious until the release
[09:30:07] <danheberden> they don't bother
[09:30:14] <ajpiano> and that's assuming we're really ready for RC on sept 1 anyway
[09:30:39] <DaveMethvin> and then they recoil in horror because .attr(function, NaN, null, new Date) doesn't work anymore
[09:30:46] <danheberden> but a longer RC time might help people to do that
[09:31:05] <danheberden> give them time to run it - and if they run the RC instead of 1.7 - either way, they'd upgrade
[09:31:11] <jzaefferer> +Pi on making the RC blog post equivalent to the final blog post
[09:31:14] <danheberden> whether it be from RC to 1.7, or 1.7 to 1.7.1
[09:31:23] <timmywil> OK, I gotta run
[09:31:29] <DaveMethvin> bye timmywil
[09:31:31] <addyosmani> do we plan on making any prior announcements about breakages we'll expect 1.7 to make this time around? I believe I recall someone mentioning this on the spreadsheet too.
[09:31:34] <timmywil> thanks all
[09:31:48] <addyosmani> (of course after we've decided what 1.7 is going to contain etc)
[09:31:51] <JohnResig> addyosmani: yeah, we can do that with the Beta announcement
[09:32:03] <danheberden> addyosmani that'd be all .. ya, JohnResig +1
[09:32:12] <JohnResig> so are we shooting Beta on Sept 1st then?
[09:32:25] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[09:32:27] <danheberden> can we shoot for earlier?
[09:32:35] <JohnResig> danheberden: why?
[09:32:38] <danheberden> like - just to be on top of things
[09:32:43] <danheberden> have time to handle bugs that come in
[09:32:49] <danheberden> like - just try to be earlier
[09:32:50] <JohnResig> a month is more than enough time
[09:32:53] <danheberden> ok
[09:33:00] <ajpiano> we can probably do an alpha in august
[09:33:08] <danheberden> ya, i might be overthinking it
[09:33:08] <JohnResig> if we go longer it just starts to get ridiculous - and people we get upset that we're taking too long to release
[09:33:10] <danheberden> w/e's cool
[09:33:24] <JohnResig> yeah, I'd be fine with doing multiple alpha releases early on
[09:33:24] <ajpiano> like a legit, this-may-still-be-broken, alpha..
[09:33:30] <danheberden> JohnResig i was thinking more, like, an aggressive goal to keep us motivated
[09:33:31] <JohnResig> but we need to be feature complete by Sept 1st
[09:33:41] <danheberden> like i said, prolly just overthinking it
[09:33:48] <danheberden> sounds cool
[09:34:01] <JohnResig> let's set Alpha 1 for July 1st
[09:34:06] <JohnResig> Alpha 2 for August 1st
[09:34:15] <danheberden> i really like that
[09:34:20] <JohnResig> (or Alpha N, depending upon how many we've had in the interim)
[09:34:32] <JohnResig> any thoughts?
[09:34:33] <danheberden> like firefox, but better
[09:34:35] <ajpiano> at the risk of elongating this conversation
[09:34:41] <ajpiano> i think we shouldn't alpha until mid-july or august
[09:34:43] <DaveMethvin> maybe we could make blog entries when we land stuff?
[09:34:53] <DaveMethvin> so ppl could just use the nightlies
[09:35:05] <danheberden> ajpiano july 15th then?
[09:35:36] <JohnResig> ok - how about August 1st for first alpha - but with blog posts in the interim to get people using nightlies?
[09:35:38] <ajpiano> sure... just saying we probably won't be ready for an alpha 3 weeks after deciding who's doing which bugs etc.
[09:35:44] <ajpiano> JohnResig, that sounds good
[09:35:58] <JohnResig> nightly blog posts seems slightly dangerous as people will try to use it and then it'll explode almost instantly
[09:36:08] <JohnResig> APIs won't be doc'ed or very well defined
[09:36:28] <danheberden> this might be OT, but would a seperate 'dev' blog be a good idea?
[09:36:29] <ajpiano> hm
[09:36:35] <danheberden> if we're gonna try to do more posts about this
[09:36:45] <danheberden> scratch that, bad idea
[09:36:46] <ajpiano> i don't think we need a separate thing, just lowers visibility
[09:36:47] <ajpiano> anyhow
[09:37:16] <rwaldron> (sorry I'm late, was afk, lost track of time)
[09:37:18] <ajpiano> JohnResig, theoretically, we could like, also decide on june 6th to start doccing things
[09:37:34] <ajpiano> this way people can write features according to docs, unicorns can serve us tea, etc ;)
[09:37:54] <JohnResig> ajpiano: sure - althoug more accurately, we should really get into it in August so that we'll be 100% doc'ed by the Beta release
[09:38:16] <ajpiano> right, just so that it is kinda happening simultaneously to dev so that it can help out alpha users
[09:38:31] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: +1
[09:38:49] <danheberden> is there an easy way to do that with docs though?
[09:38:58] <danheberden> if we have 1.7 in with 1.6 in august
[09:39:02] <danheberden> even with a 'beta' flag
[09:39:08] <DaveMethvin> can we make things live in api.jquery.com with a beta tag perhaps?
[09:39:22] <DaveMethvin> it would be handy to expose things earlier
[09:39:22] <JohnResig> don't we already do that?
[09:39:24] <danheberden> i wish we had this static content thing done
[09:39:30] <DaveMethvin> not for 1.6 new apis we didn't
[09:39:46] <DaveMethvin> we do it for jquery templates but that was kind of an exception
[09:39:51] <DaveMethvin> since it's been beta forever
[09:39:55] <danheberden> lol
[09:40:02] <DaveMethvin> we can start doing it tho
[09:40:10] <jaubourg> sorry :/
[09:40:12] <DaveMethvin> i can talk to kswedberg and assk
[09:40:56] <danheberden> so lets add that to our june tasks
[09:41:00] <danheberden> how to get docs out the best
[09:41:20] <danheberden> cuz it would be really nice to have docs with the beta/RC
[09:41:28] <danheberden> that way people can really get into it
[09:41:34] <DaveMethvin> agreed, and putting it in api would just make it faster
[09:41:38] <danheberden> and, hell, we might even feel more organized about it
[09:42:12] <JohnResig> danheberden: that'll be for July then
[09:42:22] <JohnResig> not much point in having docs for an alpha if the features aren't even created yet
[09:42:37] <danheberden> i thought unicorns were serving us tea
[09:42:41] <danheberden> :D
[09:42:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah the docs shouldn't appear until the features land
[09:42:58] <danheberden> JohnResig i'm just talking about setting whatever infrastructure
[09:43:00] <DaveMethvin> no the unicorns serve tea to the narwhals
[09:43:02] <danheberden> so that when we ARE putting things in
[09:43:07] <danheberden> we, well, can
[09:43:50] <JohnResig> haha
[09:43:55] <JohnResig> ok, so I think we're good here
[09:44:19] <ajpiano> i would say so
[09:44:22] <JohnResig> we have dates set and the meeting date finalized
[09:44:29] <JohnResig> I'll see if I can work on the tooling more to provide more details
[09:44:51] <JohnResig> guess that's it
[09:44:56] <JohnResig> thanks everyone - have a good week!
[09:45:04] <ajpiano> yeah, hopefully we can get scott_gonzalez voting on tickets soon ;)
[09:45:16] <JohnResig> I have no idea what's up with his account
[09:45:22] <JohnResig> but he can vote from the main voting page
[09:45:24] <JohnResig> so he's good there
[09:45:32] <JohnResig> he /can/ vote, just kind of indirectly
