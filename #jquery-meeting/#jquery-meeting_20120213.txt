[08:59:23] <DaveMethvin> dere i fixed it
[09:01:16] * danheberden gives DaveMethvin a gold star
[09:01:55] <mikesherov> here
[09:03:48] <DaveMethvin> hokay
[09:03:54] <danheberden> moar jqueries
[09:04:02] <DaveMethvin> i am not az organized as i shoudl be
[09:04:20] <mikesherov> I'm watching you type the agenda Dave
[09:04:26] <DaveMethvin> moar organize
[09:04:27] <rwaldron> creeeepy
[09:04:31] <mikesherov> LOL
[09:05:15] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:06:00] <DaveMethvin> so at this point we're way past the holidays, really need to set up a schedule for these releases
[09:06:24] <DaveMethvin> it seems like there are some moar bugs we can tackle for 1.7.2 perhaps?
[09:06:58] <mikesherov> I've reviewed all the "css" bugs
[09:06:58] <DaveMethvin> there isn't a huge cry for a new release, so i am thinking we could clean up a few other items for 1.7.2
[09:07:04] <mikesherov> I can't repro a few of them
[09:07:27] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin +1
[09:07:33] <mikesherov> I also would LOVE if I could get the border-box stuff into 1.7.2
[09:07:38] <rwaldron> it's ok to take our time
[09:07:46] <mikesherov> but I was under the impression it was bug fixes only
[09:08:11] <DaveMethvin> yes it would be good to avoid new features, and also any major behavior changes even if they are bugfixes
[09:08:14] <mikesherov> But that breaks semantic versioning
[09:08:30] <mikesherov> Agreed
[09:08:37] <DaveMethvin> we should be working on 1.8 stuff in parallel
[09:08:37] <danheberden> +1 as well
[09:08:56] <DaveMethvin> and that's where we can break stuff
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:09:07] <mikesherov> I'd love a 1.8 branch, so I can land the border-box stuff and move on
[09:09:15] <danheberden> DaveMethvin mikesherov we can setup a branch'd git pull as well
[09:09:17] <danheberden> if you'd like
[09:09:29] <mikesherov> there is a lot of support test work that needs to happen one after another and I'm sort of reaching an impasse
[09:09:31] <DaveMethvin> that would be useful
[09:09:38] <mikesherov> Would be very useful to me
[09:09:56] <DaveMethvin> so what do we call the 1.8 git file?
[09:10:11] <DaveMethvin> should it be generic like jquery-git-next?
[09:10:21] <danheberden> DaveMethvin not sure - i started work on an auto pull by branch that would work for any, so i'll see what works
[09:10:31] <DaveMethvin> k danheberden, thanks!
[09:11:23] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil are you here?
[09:12:04] <DaveMethvin> let's come to some agreement on what people need to run the unit tests
[09:12:14] <mikesherov> FUN
[09:12:16] <DaveMethvin> PHP, yes.
[09:12:25] <mikesherov> +1 PHP
[09:12:39] <mikesherov> people have NO idea if thy're breaking AJAX ever
[09:12:47] <mikesherov> if they only run from file://
[09:12:56] <mikesherov> plus the file:// check for isLocal is faulty
[09:13:19] <mikesherov> as ben_alman demonstrated, people DO test from http:// WITHOUT php
[09:13:33] <DaveMethvin> right, but do we solve that with code, or is docs okay?
[09:13:47] <DaveMethvin> like, "YOU MUST USE TEH PHP"
[09:13:52] <mikesherov> I wrote a unit test that checks for PHP
[09:14:03] <mikesherov> that PR was closed, and rightfully so
[09:14:09] <mikesherov> but it can be resurrected
[09:14:16] <danheberden> we *could* open that up to use whatever is available, ya?
[09:14:28] <DaveMethvin> as long as it doesn't complicate things too much
[09:14:32] <danheberden> e.g. a ruby script with a small webserver gem
[09:14:49] <danheberden> but isn't node already a dependancy
[09:14:49] <danheberden> ?
[09:14:51] <mikesherov> well, the problem is that the AJAX tests actually USE PHP
[09:15:01] <DaveMethvin> then we'd need several different server-side ways to include files
[09:15:02] <ben_alman> wat
[09:15:09] <danheberden> i must not be understanding mikesherov
[09:15:24] <ben_alman> oh well i tested that way because i didn't know. if the docs say "http:// requires php" then i know for the future
[09:15:30] <timmywil> hi
[09:15:36] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:15:37] <mikesherov> ben_alman, rightfully so!
[09:15:38] <danheberden> mikesherov what about this being centralized?
[09:15:44] <danheberden> can the php part be something on jq servers?
[09:16:03] <danheberden> it sounds like this is validating ajax and responding with a "yup, it was right" or not?
[09:16:05] <mikesherov> so, I wrote a PR that was closed that made PHP a required thing
[09:16:17] <DaveMethvin> i'd kinda like some place where we could run the unit tests on jquery.com
[09:16:22] <mikesherov> but even before that, for a while, AJAX has needed PHP
[09:16:32] <danheberden> DaveMethvin would that be a possibility through browserstack?
[09:16:37] <timmywil> i didn't get to sizzle. sorry! I'm much more free after wednesday.
[09:16:52] <ben_alman> the ajax server component really needs to be hosted on the dev server, it's not practical or reliable to host the unit testing ajax endpoint on a remote machine
[09:17:07] <mikesherov> for example: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/data/echoQuery.php
[09:17:21] <DaveMethvin> ok, just to get everyone on the same page ...
[09:17:26] <danheberden> ben_alman something like that though?
[09:17:29] <danheberden> echoing back stuff?
[09:17:34] <danheberden> i think it's a good failsafe, at least
[09:17:35] <mikesherov> correct
[09:17:37] <DaveMethvin> the unit tests need some basic server func for echoing back headers, right
[09:17:43] <danheberden> if you don't have the abiility to run it locally, it'll at least *run*
[09:17:52] <mikesherov> right, but it accomplishes that goofily
[09:18:12] <mikesherov> currently, qunit detects isLocal by looking for file://, and if it sees file://, it just skips the AJAX tests
[09:18:51] <timmywil> mikesherov: we could detect PHP instead right?
[09:18:54] <mikesherov> but that's faulty, as ben_alman demonstrated by running them locally through http:// but without PHP
[09:19:06] <mikesherov> I then wrote a unit test to detect PHP properly
[09:19:15] <mikesherov> which was closed because it was overreaching
[09:19:18] <mikesherov> it made PHP a req.
[09:19:34] <mikesherov> I do believe PHP, or at least some server-side tech a requirement
[09:19:56] <mikesherov> because I then wrote a script that includes all of the jquery src as one file in the unit tests
[09:20:00] <mikesherov> and that required PHP
[09:20:09] <mikesherov> and I wrote a janky javascript fallback
[09:20:26] <mikesherov> which works, but I think it's ghetto
[09:20:30] <timmywil_> woops, dunno what happened there
[09:20:42] <mikesherov> Chrome doesn't really like file://
[09:20:55] <mikesherov> you have to run chrome with --allow-file-access-from-file
[09:21:12] <DaveMethvin> well i don't think file:// has to run the whole suite since it can't, but letting at least some of it run locally is nice
[09:21:21] <mikesherov> nice?
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> but to me not a requirement
[09:21:31] <DaveMethvin> nice as in "i don't have a server atm"
[09:21:32] <mikesherov> I think it's terrible
[09:21:55] <mikesherov> People don't realize they aren't running the whole suite
[09:22:08] <mikesherov> plus chrome is getting hostile towards running JS from file://
[09:22:12] <DaveMethvin> that's what your "missing my server" test is for
[09:22:29] <mikesherov> I see, just replace "isLocal" with "hasPHP"
[09:22:32] <DaveMethvin> if you ran it from file:// it would just yell a few times
[09:22:40] <timmywil> it's too easy to let it work with file:// so we should do it.
[09:22:48] <DaveMethvin> but otherwise succeed with a few errors saying it coudln't run all the tests
[09:23:03] <mikesherov> sure, but then we need to document the chrome dependency
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:23:16] <mikesherov> on running webkit with --allow-file-access-from-files
[09:23:18] <rwaldron> How did this become so effing complicated?
[09:23:27] <mikesherov> it's my fault really
[09:23:31] <rwaldron> I think we might be trying to solve the wrong problems
[09:23:51] <mikesherov> I tried to DRY how we include the JS files in the tests
[09:23:56] <timmywil> we shouldn't spend too much time on this. We should get the test suite in working order, then stop changing shit.
[09:24:05] <rwaldron> timmywil +9001
[09:24:15] <DaveMethvin> i think we're trying to accomodate too many people
[09:24:19] <mikesherov> I agree
[09:24:25] <mikesherov> I'm all for making PHP a req.
[09:24:26] <DaveMethvin> sorry but we aren't gonna support ruby, node, etc for server side
[09:24:27] <DaveMethvin> but i don't really want to have to support multiple different server technologies, it really complicates things, so PHP only?
[09:24:40] <timmywil> sounds good to me
[09:24:50] <DaveMethvin> yay for simple!
[09:25:00] <mikesherov> So, if we agree that PHP is a req, I have that PR
[09:25:13] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:25:18] <rwaldron> +1 to picking one thing and sticking to it
[09:25:34] <timmywil> well, I don't think we actually need to make it a req. We've documented it, let's just leave it at that.
[09:25:43] <timmywil> no need to break all tests.
[09:26:00] <mikesherov> Well, that's the thing timmy
[09:26:13] <DaveMethvin> php detect is what tells you file:// didn't do all tests
[09:26:19] <mikesherov> all the tests are broken in file:// with chrome if you don't run it with --allow-file-access-from-file
[09:26:28] <DaveMethvin> and it can also warn about file:// issues with chrome for that matter
[09:26:32] <timmywil> mikesherov: that's fine
[09:26:49] <mikesherov> Right, so I'll resurrect that PR, and allow it to run from file://
[09:26:58] <mikesherov> and just warn about chrome and not having PHP
[09:27:01] <timmywil> mikesherov: we don't actually say you can run it from file, but if people try and some tests work, great! If they notice that some tests are failing, they can read the docs.
[09:27:16] <DaveMethvin> hahah read the docs, timmywil you slay  me
[09:27:20] <danheberden> timmywil i.e., make a bug
[09:27:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that's what he meant
[09:27:40] <danheberden> *bug repot
[09:27:48] <timmywil> heh, well.
[09:27:49] <danheberden> *report in the bug depot!
[09:27:51] <mikesherov> OK, so I'm on that.
[09:27:59] <mikesherov> sorry for the confusion
[09:28:10] <mikesherov> I was just trying to fix the maintainability of unit tests
[09:28:23] <mikesherov> there were like 4 or 5 broken manual tests
[09:28:23] <DaveMethvin> and i do like the ability to run with the built file
[09:28:48] <mikesherov> yeah, the bult file is necessary if we ever want to write tests for lazy-loading jquery
[09:28:49] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin we need to address something there too
[09:28:59] <DaveMethvin> wazzat rwaldron
[09:30:11] <rwaldron> the php concatenization of the source files is actually transforming them
[09:30:31] <DaveMethvin> yes, i think we need to examine that whole process for 1.8 anyway
[09:30:32] <rwaldron> so, they are not running as individual source files as they had since 2010
[09:30:46] <mikesherov> +1 rwaldron
[09:30:56] <rwaldron> they're in a state of "built on the fly"
[09:31:02] <rwaldron> "sort of"
[09:31:04] <rwaldron> or something
[09:31:07] <mikesherov> sort of?
[09:31:09] <DaveMethvin> but in some ways the current is closer to the built file, so not bad
[09:31:10] <mikesherov> well, definitely
[09:31:23] <DaveMethvin> like, if the closure variables are dups :P
[09:31:33] <mikesherov> right, it uses the same process as the Makefile
[09:31:39] <rwaldron> mikesherov wait, no , not sort of
[09:31:43] <rwaldron> i had to check
[09:31:50] <rwaldron> wasn't sure if you'd included intro/outro
[09:32:12] <rwaldron> basically, we should drop intro/outro and any form of source transform for the source only tests
[09:32:17] <rwaldron> OR
[09:32:20] <rwaldron> don't do that
[09:32:34] <rwaldron> because honestly, that sucked
[09:33:00] <rwaldron> and resulted in a bunch of unnec redundant code getting written
[09:33:05] <rwaldron> toString?
[09:33:19] <mikesherov> oh, you're saying the imaginary closures in general suck
[09:33:29] <mikesherov> I just followed the example of the Makefile
[09:33:36] <rwaldron> but now that we are "simulating" a build everytime, without actually building, we have a new advantage
[09:33:57] <rwaldron> So, I bring this up because I want us to all be aware and on the same page
[09:34:09] <DaveMethvin> right, we're closer to the actual built file, whereas before it was more like a poor man's AMD
[09:34:19] <rwaldron> something like that
[09:34:30] <mikesherov> wait, I'm not sure why we're saying "closer"
[09:34:40] <mikesherov> the PHP script does the same thing as the makefile, no?
[09:34:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's just not the built file
[09:34:57] <DaveMethvin> basically the same
[09:35:11] <mikesherov> right
[09:35:27] <DaveMethvin> which is good since whatever problems we created by combining the closures will be created there too :D
[09:35:37] <mikesherov> right, that was my thought
[09:35:43] <timmywil> some duplication tho ya? can we have php just run the make?
[09:35:48] <mikesherov> and including more than 1 js file makes lazy-loading untestable
[09:36:04] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice to dry it out if it doesn't take a lot longer
[09:36:09] <mikesherov> well, I think Rick's point is more that the imaginary wall we created is silly
[09:36:14] <DaveMethvin> php doing it on the fly is prolly faster
[09:36:19] <mikesherov> And I think Rick is migrating to grunt anyway
[09:36:22] <timmywil> yea prolly
[09:36:34] <ben_alman> shit i need to finish grunt
[09:36:36] <ben_alman> heh
[09:36:49] <mikesherov> If we migrate to grunt, we can have PHP run grunt and then use the ACTUAL dist/ file
[09:36:53] <DaveMethvin> oh no pressure ben_alman, we'll let you know the unfinished parts
[09:37:20] <mikesherov> but I think Rick's point about source transform still stands
[09:37:23] <ben_alman> it's all unfinished parts
[09:37:33] <mikesherov> gibson024's PR deftly illustrated that
[09:37:51] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:37:54] <mikesherov> rSpace vs. rSpaceAjax to make JSHint happy is bonkers
[09:38:42] <DaveMethvin> so, any other issues to be discussed?
[09:38:47] <DaveMethvin> thanks for joining us bot-t
[09:38:47] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, I'm a bot you know..
[09:38:57] <timmywil> bot-t: so you say
[09:39:00] <rwaldron> sorry, i got distracted by boaz
[09:39:00] <bot-t> timmywil, #8419 (Ajax calls to encoded Internationalized domain names ... - Opened 12 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8419
[09:39:17] <rwaldron> " rSpace vs. rSpaceAjax to make JSHint happy is bonkers"  +9001
[09:39:29] <rwaldron> I remember working with jaubourg on those
[09:39:35] <mikesherov> speak of the devil
[09:39:42] <rwaldron> we went through them step by step
[09:39:42] <mikesherov> welcome gibson042
[09:39:44] <rwaldron> it was aweful
[09:39:47] <rwaldron> awful*
[09:39:53] <gibson042> hello
[09:40:02] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:40:16] <DaveMethvin> so, anything else?
[09:40:20] <mikesherov> here's gibson042's PR demonstrating the insanity of fake AMD: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/668
[09:40:21] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (1w, 6d ago): no ticket: smarter build to avoid redefining common subcomponent-local variables
[09:41:17] <rwaldron> I much prefer the idea of "simulated" build, transforms and everything (that is, the removal of IIFE stuff)
[09:41:34] <rwaldron> it will free us of redundant junk
[09:41:48] <DaveMethvin> just to recap schedule, I think we don't necessarily need a delivery date for 1.7.2 but would like to do betas every few weeks if we don't do a release
[09:41:55] <mikesherov> right, but that means the JS fallback is busted
[09:42:07] <DaveMethvin> on 1.8 if danheberden gets us a separate build we can start playing there
[09:42:11] <rwaldron> mikesherov fuuuuuuuuuu
[09:42:12] <rwaldron> dude
[09:42:13] <mikesherov> if we rely on a simulated build, file:// is busted
[09:42:14] <rwaldron> who cares
[09:42:19] <mikesherov> I don't care
[09:42:19] <rwaldron> require PHP
[09:42:25] <mikesherov> but we gotta say PHP is required
[09:42:27] <rwaldron> de jure
[09:42:32] <mikesherov> I'm all for that!
[09:42:32] <rwaldron> and move on
[09:42:45] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin danheberden timmywil can we please get consensus
[09:42:58] <DaveMethvin> well we have been trying to preserve file:// but i have to say *I* don't use it
[09:43:08] <mikesherov> Neither do I
[09:43:08] <DaveMethvin> if there was a good reason why it didn't work i'd be okay with that
[09:43:16] <rwaldron> it makes me anxious know the test suite is in flux like this
[09:43:23] <rwaldron> to* know
[09:43:30] <rwaldron> i have an idea
[09:43:32] <mikesherov> the good reason is that we're talking about making the individual files not work]
[09:43:32] <rwaldron> holy shit
[09:43:36] <rwaldron> ready?
[09:43:47] <rwaldron> we can offer a static, auto-built html file
[09:43:53] <rwaldron> that is file:// sage
[09:43:55] <rwaldron> safe*
[09:43:56] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:44:04] <rwaldron> we'll do it with the grunt system
[09:44:08] <mikesherov> right
[09:44:18] <mikesherov> but that requires you to run grunt before testing each time :-)
[09:44:25] <mikesherov> which I'm also fine with
[09:44:28] <DaveMethvin> whenever rwaldron is faced with a problem, he says "we can use grunt"  now we have two problems
[09:44:30] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:44:35] <mikesherov> just pointing it out
[09:44:50] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin do I really sound like that?
[09:45:01] <DaveMethvin> naw just yankin your chain
[09:45:08] <mikesherov> OK, I gotta run. My vote is "drop file://, require PHP, stop the nonsense"
[09:45:08] <DaveMethvin> and ben_alman's too
[09:45:21] <rwaldron> fair enough
[09:45:26] <mikesherov> but again, I'll do whatever the body decides
[09:45:33] <DaveMethvin> well let's get the php dependency in first, and think about fancier stuff for 1.8
[09:45:40] <rwaldron> yes
[09:45:43] <rwaldron> +1
[09:45:43] <mikesherov> OK< so PHP is a requirement?
[09:45:48] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:46:03] <DaveMethvin> as we were saying earlier
[09:46:04] <mikesherov> can I stop the JS fallback and trying to get soem tests to work in file://?
[09:46:18] <DaveMethvin> just barf out an error hairball
[09:46:22] <mikesherov> GREAT
[09:46:23] <DaveMethvin> but run what we can
[09:46:26] <danheberden> sounds fine - if we find a better way, it's not like making php not required is backwards compat issue :p
[09:46:35] <mikesherov> nothing will run
[09:46:36] <danheberden> like, that we'll have to require php for the rest of the project's existance
[09:46:47] <DaveMethvin> right, this isn't a release thing
[09:46:51] <DaveMethvin> we can change our mindes
[09:46:53] <mikesherov> no, but wait
[09:46:58] <DaveMethvin> it's not like $.Callbacks
[09:47:02] <mikesherov> I'm saying, that without PHP, nothing will run
[09:47:04] <danheberden> ?os
[09:47:04] <bot-t> oh snao™
[09:47:11] <timmywil> mikesherov: we're saying no to making php a requirement in the sense of disabling all tests if no php.
[09:47:41] <timmywil> it is a requirement in that we will tell people to use php
[09:47:44] <mikesherov> right, then do I remove the isLocal test or no? do I keep the JS fallback to enable file:// or no
[09:48:05] <mikesherov> because the tests will be busted
[09:48:06] <mikesherov> g2g
[09:48:07] <DaveMethvin> if the tests are run without php, generate a tests fail, but continue running tests but skip ajax or whatever else fails
[09:48:09] <mikesherov> let me know
[09:48:22] <mikesherov> ok
[09:48:26] <mikesherov> bye guys
[09:48:28] <DaveMethvin> so your php tests is the feature detect
[09:48:31] <DaveMethvin> adios
[09:48:35] <timmywil> laterz
[09:48:35] <mikesherov> thanks!
