[08:54:27] <timmywil> i'll be back in a 5-10min
[09:00:53] <addyosmani> hey all
[09:01:41] <DaveMethvin> hey addyosmani
[09:02:01] <DaveMethvin> oh it's meeting tiem
[09:02:16] <DaveMethvin> sounds like timmywil and gnarf were going to be a little late
[09:04:35] <gnarf> back
[09:05:27] <DaveMethvin> just looking at http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size
[09:05:29] <addyosmani> wb gnarf
[09:05:40] <DaveMethvin> how did we gain more than 1k this version?
[09:06:55] <gnarf> lots of little things i imagine
[09:07:04] <gnarf> i know i'm responsible for ~600 bytes
[09:07:30] <gnarf> in the queue stuff
[09:08:43] <DaveMethvin> when i landed event it was -200 or so, we prolly added some back with fixHooks but still should be in the less category
[09:09:13] * gnarf cheers for DaveMethvin
[09:09:45] <DaveMethvin> i just golfed another 30 or so bytes out over the weekend while fixing a couple of bugs so i feel good
[09:10:45] <DaveMethvin> of course that means whatever added the 1k really added more than 1k
[09:11:12] <DaveMethvin> gnarf that size tally at the end of the make is a really great idea
[09:11:15] <timmywil> sry, had a meeting
[09:11:16] <timmywil> back
[09:11:30] <DaveMethvin> it's like standing on the bathroom scale while eating dinner :P
[09:11:35] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:11:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: thanks - but i think it was someone elses idea, i just implemented ;)
[09:11:47] <DaveMethvin> cool, i guess we have a quorum
[09:11:56] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig: you around?
[09:12:06] <timmywil> it twas my idea :)
[09:12:18] <DaveMethvin> kudos all around!
[09:12:41] <DaveMethvin> so what's left on 1.7
[09:12:53] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: hence the need for us to go through everything in 1.8 to reduce bytes
[09:13:03] <timmywil> i bet i can get sizzle down
[09:13:10] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.7&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&report=206&order=priority
[09:13:17] <gnarf> mousewheel DaveMethvin?
[09:13:38] <DaveMethvin> i can fix that this week but the rc can go out
[09:13:52] <gnarf> docs#9217 is still waiting for timmy to be inspired to write a unit
[09:13:52] <DaveMethvin> i just need to let brandon know he needs to do an update
[09:13:53] <bot-t> [#9217] jQuery crashes in IE8 when scrollTop-animated element is removed (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9217
[09:14:13] <timmywil> blerg, i keep forgetting
[09:14:20] <timmywil> im gonna assign that to me
[09:14:29] <DaveMethvin> docs#9945 isn't that a long-standing issue?
[09:14:30] <bot-t> [#9945] Percentage Width Elements in Hidden Divs (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9945
[09:14:43] <DaveMethvin> and by that i mean it's standing because it's hard to knock down
[09:15:49] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: on docs#9941 i am still not clear on why some code is/was calling removeEvent(null ...)
[09:15:50] <bot-t> rwaldron, [#9941]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9941
[09:16:15] <DaveMethvin> it seemed that should never happen unless there was a bug in a special event handler for example
[09:16:55] <gnarf> timmywil: im pushing another update to my 9217 branch
[09:16:57] <gnarf> right now
[09:17:14] <timmywil> gnarf: ok
[09:17:59] <gnarf> just changed the width/height step function to be defined in the same way i defined the scroll step functino
[09:18:06] <gnarf> as we discussed
[09:18:29] <timmywil> cool
[09:18:32] <DaveMethvin> so does it seem like we should be able to get rc1 out today then?
[09:19:04] <DaveMethvin> i have a couple of meetings in the afternoon but can work on a release around 5pm
[09:19:19] <DaveMethvin> or if there's a lot to do we could plan for tomorrow
[09:19:42] <timmywil> today sounds good
[09:19:45] <gnarf> it does't seem like there are many open tickets
[09:19:47] <gnarf> i think today works
[09:19:52] <gnarf> its what we planned last week
[09:20:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't see any real blockers on this list now
[09:20:21] <DaveMethvin> so that works for me
[09:20:45] <gnarf> whats up with those two high bugs?
[09:20:57] <gnarf> we talked about the % width one
[09:21:00] <gnarf> that one is tricky
[09:21:05] <gnarf> might get pushed off
[09:21:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:21:16] <gnarf> fadeIn on inline?
[09:22:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i think 9945 has been an issue forever. maybe it should return percentage?
[09:22:55] <timmywil> better than returning 94, but .width() is a different issue
[09:23:04] <timmywil> 94px* in .css('width')
[09:23:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah it could just return percentage but i thought ppl were expecting px
[09:23:32] <DaveMethvin> it's just kinda hard to get px
[09:23:34] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:23:47] <rwaldron> whoops
[09:23:49] <gnarf> couldn't we find the parent's width?
[09:23:50] <DaveMethvin> but that
[09:23:51] <rwaldron> was in a client meeting
[09:23:51] <timmywil> we can do conversions, but so far we've only done that for IE
[09:24:13] <DaveMethvin> what do we do about a td that's a percentage tho?
[09:24:21] <timmywil> to fix this would require a refactor, which I don't think we want to do this close to release
[09:24:26] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:24:57] <gnarf> hi rick!
[09:25:01] <timmywil> hey rwaldron
[09:25:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah how dare you talk to clients! now we know who you love more
[09:25:27] <timmywil> so i'll assign it to me for 1.next?
[09:25:33] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:25:49] <timmywil> technically, it could go in 1.7.x
[09:26:08] <DaveMethvin> i think we're good for the release then, i'll plan on starting the rc1 this afternoon after checking with everyone in -dev
[09:26:25] <DaveMethvin> anything else we shoudl cover today?
[09:26:50] <timmywil> docs
[09:27:02] <DaveMethvin> oh noes!
[09:27:05] <timmywil> we need a date to have all docs in
[09:27:14] <DaveMethvin> before we ship for sure
[09:27:18] <timmywil> yea
[09:27:22] <DaveMethvin> so maybe the next question is  ....
[09:27:25] <ajpiano> hey guys
[09:27:28] <DaveMethvin> when should we release?
[09:27:30] <ajpiano> i have a question
[09:27:31] <DaveMethvin> hey ajpiano
[09:27:42] <ajpiano> it is.... are me and timmy the only ones whose e-mail notifications are borked
[09:27:44] <ajpiano> or is it everyone
[09:27:52] <DaveMethvin> seems like i am not getting notifications either
[09:27:53] <rwaldron> same
[09:28:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: bug emails?
[09:28:04] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:28:05] <DaveMethvin> who can unbork them?
[09:28:06] <gnarf> i haven't seen one in a while either
[09:28:10] <ajpiano> only trac-o-bot sends emails now :/
[09:28:12] <timmywil> maybe danheberden can look into it
[09:28:15] <gnarf> danheberden: do i have access to trac?
[09:28:28] <timmywil> or gnarf
[09:28:32] <ajpiano> jqueryui's trac e-mails are workin just fine
[09:28:43] <gnarf> yeah, jqueryui works, i haven't seen a jquery one in a while
[09:28:52] <gnarf> and i set up my subscription to everything in trac
[09:29:05] <gnarf> might just be a config issue with the email on the server or something
[09:29:27] <gnarf> maybe it got marked as a "spammer" by some service or something
[09:29:48] <ajpiano> yeah i retested my configs as well
[09:29:50] <ajpiano> it's been a week
[09:30:12] <timmywil> maybe longer
[09:31:12] <gnarf> i can take a look if dan can get me into the box
[09:31:16] <timmywil> so docs and release by next monday 10/31.  we can push if needed
[09:31:18] <ajpiano> danheberden: can you assist?
[09:31:52] <DaveMethvin> skype is showing danheberden offline
[09:32:04] <DaveMethvin> we can ping him later
[09:32:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah timmywil let's shoot for both docs and relase on halloween
[09:32:36] <timmywil> ?tell danheberden notification emails for core are on the fritz
[09:32:37] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[09:32:57] <timmywil> cool, scary release
[09:33:02] <gnarf> dan's getting me access via ssh
[09:33:34] <gnarf> i'll take a look at that
[09:33:36] <DaveMethvin> what specifically needs to be documented?
[09:33:38] <timmywil> so we need on/off, event props, ummm
[09:33:42] <DaveMethvin> i think i know events
[09:33:43] <gnarf> um i started a clap
[09:34:01] <timmywil> callbacks
[09:34:04] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah but i guess we can't link to it
[09:34:05] <gnarf> http://oksoclap.com/1-7-docs
[09:34:20] <timmywil> removeData/removeAttr
[09:34:28] <timmywil> queues
[09:34:39] <DaveMethvin> i am working on the event stuff
[09:34:50] <DaveMethvin> i think callbacks doesn't need to be immediately documented
[09:34:57] <gnarf> we can use that clap to coordinate 1.7 docs efforts?
[09:35:08] <gnarf> I could probably document callbacks
[09:35:18] <timmywil> addyosmani wrote an excellent post for it
[09:35:20] <DaveMethvin> i can link in the meeting notes, although it's a public pad
[09:35:46] <addyosmani> Lies. Most of what I write is crap :)
[09:35:53] <addyosmani> But feel free to use/reference
[09:37:41] <addyosmani> http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-1-7s-callbacks-feature-demystified/
[09:38:22] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah i think we can/should document isNumeric now
[09:38:45] <DaveMethvin> i contacted the $.isNaN users I found on google codesearch and warned them
[09:38:52] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ha, nice
[09:40:43] <DaveMethvin> just going thru commits looking for undocmented stuf
[09:40:56] <timmywil> me too
[09:41:36] <DaveMethvin> AMD
[09:41:44] <timmywil> oo yes
[09:41:48] <timmywil> where does that go?
[09:42:21] <DaveMethvin> er, ah, hrm
[09:42:41] <DaveMethvin> seems like it wants its own page but who knows where it should live
[09:42:51] <timmywil> it's not really API
[09:42:57] <DaveMethvin> at the very least we need to document it in the blog for now
[09:43:07] <DaveMethvin> there was a followup ticket about it
[09:43:32] <DaveMethvin> hey i have a phone call
[09:43:44] <timmywil> there's a PR, but I think we should stick with jrburke's suggestion and leave jQuery global for now
[09:44:06] <timmywil> there would be a ton of support tickets if we don't
[09:45:52] <addyosmani> There were some concerns (other than jrburke's) on the RequireJS mailing list about that changing. Sounds reasonable to leave as is for the time being timmywil
[09:45:54] <timmywil> ok, we can add more as we think of them, but if we have everything on that list it'll be ballin
[09:46:20] <timmywil> addyosmani: yea i saw
[09:47:51] <timmywil> ok everyone, I think we're good.  thanks!
[09:48:03] <DaveMethvin> sorry, i'll catch up in -dev
