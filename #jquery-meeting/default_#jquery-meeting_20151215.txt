[14:01:31] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting Time!
[14:01:42] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, arthurvr, arschmitz, kristyjy
[14:01:49] <arschmitz> hi
[14:01:57] <geekman-rohit> hi
[14:02:35] <sfrisk> okay, in the process of doing some pulling in the PR we talked about last week, which should be done momentarily
[14:03:12] <sfrisk> but today I wanted to tackle the currently open PR list and discuss what's in there, and close stuff that we don't think is going to get finished
[14:04:19] <geekman-rohit> sounds good, we should comment there and ask the person if they are willing to complete it
[14:04:25] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:04:26] <geekman-rohit> if not we close it during next meeting
[14:08:13] <sfrisk> sorry, one more minute
[14:13:32] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues
[14:13:39] <sfrisk> errr not that link
[14:13:43] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pulls
[14:14:03] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:15:50] <sfrisk> okay merged in the fix I wanted
[14:16:07] <sfrisk> So let's start with oldest first
[14:16:20] <sfrisk> Performance: Add BEM-Components to test suite
[14:17:10] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/61
[14:18:40] <geekman-rohit> looks like its held by some perf work
[14:18:46] <geekman-rohit> @arschmitz ?
[14:19:00] <arschmitz> so perf stuff is pretty stalled at this point
[14:19:02] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, didn't you start on the work to resolve that?
[14:19:07] <sfrisk> in the summer?
[14:19:19] <geekman-rohit> some of the work
[14:19:28] <geekman-rohit> I guess we will get to those prs soon too
[14:19:45] <arschmitz> i would close them for now its not like they are gone but since they are blocked and old
[14:20:13] <geekman-rohit> also for now I think we should focus on getting more sass done
[14:20:18] <sfrisk> I'm almost inclined to agree  . . . we can grab the work there later if needed, but they're pretttty old
[14:20:25] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[14:20:29] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:20:36] <sfrisk> I'll do that tot he checkbox one too
[14:20:42] <geekman-rohit> yep
[14:20:57] <arschmitz> #97 is supersceeded by 138 i think
[14:23:00] <sfrisk> yeah, 97 is ready to be closed in favor of 138
[14:23:58] <geekman-rohit> 111 can go
[14:24:00] <geekman-rohit> as well
[14:24:24] <sfrisk> getting to it
[14:24:28] <sfrisk> Typography: Add breakpoint variables and use them
[14:24:43] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/106
[14:24:45] <geekman-rohit> I think that should stay
[14:25:23] <sfrisk> possibly even brought in?
[14:25:30] <geekman-rohit> not all of it
[14:25:39] <geekman-rohit> jsut the scss/variables/breakpoints.js file
[14:25:42] <sfrisk> What part of it do we want
[14:25:45] <geekman-rohit> ill remove changes to other parts
[14:25:56] <sfrisk> okay, once you update that, I'll pull it in
[14:26:08] <geekman-rohit> it also changes default font size
[14:26:25] <geekman-rohit> but that can go into some other PR that deals with typo
[14:26:31] <sfrisk> yeah, leave that alone for now, just have it be the breakpoints
[14:26:36] <geekman-rohit> sure
[14:26:41] <geekman-rohit> Ill update it tomorrow
[14:28:25] <sfrisk> awesome
[14:28:42] <kristyjy> sorry I'm late
[14:29:26] <sfrisk> Life happens
[14:29:33] <sfrisk> we're going through all the PRs, and figuring out latest status
[14:29:34] <kristyjy> work happened lol
[14:30:07] <geekman-rohit> work happens with Life
[14:30:14] <sfrisk> Okay, next up is :   [hidden] { display: none !important; }
[14:30:18] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/109
[14:30:38] <geekman-rohit> i think that should go in
[14:30:43] <sfrisk> I meant to pull this in, but needed to tweak the csslint settings
[14:31:33] <sfrisk> I'll adjust the css-lint settings to make sure this doesn't throw errors
[14:31:58] <sfrisk> Next up is Build: heirarchial prefixer for scss variable files
[14:32:01] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/111
[14:32:03] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk why don't we assign PRs to people so we know who it is waiting on?
[14:32:10] <geekman-rohit> also works as a reminder
[14:32:20] <geekman-rohit> I think that can go out
[14:32:42] <sfrisk> I can't assign you, geekman-rohit
[14:32:46] <sfrisk> just jquery team people
[14:33:00] <geekman-rohit> I mean to other PRs
[14:33:09] <geekman-rohit> like if one persons pr is waiting on another person
[14:33:22] <sfrisk> it works as long as they're a jquery member
[14:33:26] <geekman-rohit> oh
[14:33:37] <geekman-rohit> cool
[14:33:40] <sfrisk> I can't assign people outside the organization
[14:34:13] <geekman-rohit> heirarchial prefixer can be closed
[14:34:37] <geekman-rohit> ill have to remove those commits and rebase some of my PRs to not use that
[14:35:04] <sfrisk> I think we should be fine, if we try not to have variable names be too long
[14:35:10] <geekman-rohit> yep
[14:35:22] <geekman-rohit> and since most work is already there without it
[14:35:30] <geekman-rohit> adding it will be just putting more prs to waiting
[14:36:44] <sfrisk> Okay, next up is Style Guide: Initial Commit of SCSS Style Guide https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/112
[14:36:59] <sfrisk> ping @kristyjy
[14:37:25] <sfrisk> I think if you merge in the current master into your branch, that should deal with any travis issues currently there
[14:37:43] <kristyjy> okay sounds good
[14:38:04] <kristyjy> I have some stuff to push to that branch as well just needed to work out a few final things
[14:38:09] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:38:34] <sfrisk> I know we want to tweak the BEM bits to discuss how we want to do modifiers
[14:38:48] <kristyjy> yeah that's what needs to be redone
[14:39:39] <sfrisk> Also I just noticed archmitz's note on the accessibility section, do we want to pull out stuff that should be in the css guide to set up a PR there?
[14:40:04] <arschmitz> i think we should
[14:40:07] <kristyjy> yeah I think I already removed that section from the guide but haven't pushed it yet
[14:41:03] <sfrisk> save the content, we can open up a issue for those items in that repo
[14:41:15] <kristyjy> okay
[14:41:41] <geekman-rohit> system crash happened
[14:41:44] <sfrisk> :-/
[14:41:48] <geekman-rohit> my pc is doomed
[14:42:50] <arschmitz> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqcn_TPu4qQ
[14:42:59] <sfrisk> Actually take anything that had the "CSS style guide" note on it, we'll list out all the items we want to include in the CSS style guide, and I can open up the issue there
[14:43:08] <sfrisk> if you want, kristyjy, you could submit the PR for that
[14:44:15] <kristyjy> okay I'll do that. I'm hoping to catch up on my open source work during the holidays as I'm taking some time off :)
[14:44:37] <sfrisk> I can help you out as much as I can too during my break, although I may be in the land of no internet for part of it
[14:44:51] * sfrisk considers adding tethering to her phone
[14:45:25] <sfrisk> Okay, next up: Build: add accessibility testing
[14:45:30] <sfrisk> from https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/114
[14:45:59] <sfrisk> I know dylanb was waiting on some feedback
[14:46:14] <arschmitz> i think we should test and land that it should be good
[14:46:30] * geekman-rohit is just glad that he is in good health again
[14:46:38] <sfrisk> me too, geekman-rohit
[14:46:48] <sfrisk> being sick sucks, sorry you were down for the count the past few weeks
[14:46:57] <geekman-rohit> 2 weeks
[14:47:00] <geekman-rohit> :/
[14:47:22] <sfrisk> I'll test and make sure that works with master, looks like there might be some merge conflicts to deal with
[14:47:40] <geekman-rohit> Im sure dylanb can rebase for us
[14:47:45] <geekman-rohit> he did mention it
[14:48:43] <sfrisk> I can leave a comment and see if he'll do the merge
[14:50:16] <sfrisk> if I don't hear back in a week, I'll do the merge
[14:50:46] <sfrisk> Next up: Progress and Meter styling
[14:50:50] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/116
[14:51:13] <sfrisk> I know you were planning on reworking this, geekman-rohit, did you want to do this as a new PR?
[14:51:23] <geekman-rohit> nope
[14:51:28] <geekman-rohit> I'll alter the commits
[14:51:32] <sfrisk> k
[14:51:48] <geekman-rohit> I have been procrastinating this for ages
[14:52:16] <geekman-rohit> not anymore, I have promised myself
[14:52:48] <geekman-rohit> also a circular progress ?
[14:53:20] <geekman-rohit> https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/progressCircular
[14:53:37] <sfrisk> I think that's closer to phase 2?
[14:53:51] <sfrisk> since it isn't actually based on an html element
[14:54:05] <sfrisk> but doing fancying things with css on a div
[14:54:12] <arschmitz> i agree
[14:54:18] <geekman-rohit> just a thought
[14:54:26] <arschmitz> though it should still be based on an element
[14:54:29] <geekman-rohit> i kindof like what angular-material does
[14:54:34] <arschmitz> you can have a hidden progress
[14:54:36] <arschmitz> or meter
[14:54:51] <sfrisk> oh, I missed that part
[14:55:22] <geekman-rohit> that pr was based on that prefixer thingy
[14:55:27] <geekman-rohit> ill have to change that too
[14:55:45] <sfrisk> ok
[14:56:02] <arschmitz> so the circular thing would be perfect to work with like the ui progress
[14:56:06] <sfrisk> also I'm putting action items for people on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:56:11] <sfrisk> agreedm arschmitz
[14:56:13] <sfrisk> agreed*
[14:56:15] <arschmitz> because we provide the style and then it can just hook in same way
[14:56:17] <sfrisk> pretend I know how to type
[14:57:13] <sfrisk> ok
[14:57:14] <sfrisk> Localize downloads. #117
[14:57:18] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/117
[14:57:23] <geekman-rohit> i m stuck with that
[14:57:48] <geekman-rohit> I couldnt find dist on some bower installed libs to be used directly by bowercopu
[14:58:41] <arschmitz> i think we should de-prioritize this
[14:58:51] <geekman-rohit> do we keep it open?
[14:58:52] <arschmitz> until we are prepared to put more effort into the perf in general
[14:59:10] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[14:59:21] <arschmitz> because tech for dependency managment changes to fast
[14:59:36] <sfrisk> true
[14:59:38] <arschmitz> id like to just use npm
[14:59:51] <arschmitz> but its not possible for a lot of things
[14:59:57] <arschmitz> but thats changing daily
[15:00:03] <sfrisk> so let's make it a goal to finish Phase One
[15:00:19] <sfrisk> and while we're in Phase Two, we could start focusing on Perf?
[15:00:31] <geekman-rohit> sure
[15:01:21] <arschmitz> sounds good
[15:01:30] <arschmitz> it will be more usefull with code to test
[15:01:58] <sfrisk> should be easier too if we have a limited number of things we're focused on
[15:02:30] <sfrisk> so 123 and 134 are both based on the same thing, although 134 is built on top of 129
[15:04:03] <geekman-rohit> 123 ?
[15:04:07] <geekman-rohit> no pr 123
[15:04:09] <sfrisk> 129
[15:04:16] <sfrisk> pretend I know numbers
[15:04:22] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/129
[15:05:14] <sfrisk> which is replaced by https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/134
[15:05:50] <sfrisk> I haven't seen any comments on that since geekman-rohit's comment
[15:05:52] <sfrisk> norm updates
[15:05:54] <sfrisk> nor
[15:06:39] <sfrisk> I can leave a comment about if theutahkate is going to address items
[15:07:00] <sfrisk> also CLA issues
[15:07:16] <geekman-rohit> someone else could take it up if there are no updates/responses
[15:07:23] <geekman-rohit> until next meeting
[15:07:28] <sfrisk> yeah
[15:08:56] <sfrisk> "Hey @theutahkate @xtinastarr!  Just checking in on the status of this PR." sound good?
[15:12:36] <geekman-rohit> ya :D
[15:12:45] <geekman-rohit> I'll comment
[15:12:49] <geekman-rohit> 'updates?'
[15:15:10] <sfrisk> sounds good
[15:15:31] <sfrisk> Okay, I need to get back to work, but I think we did a good job cleaning up a lot of this list
[15:16:54] <sfrisk> For todo items for everyone I have:
[15:17:46] <sfrisk> sfrisk: pull in [hidden], work on buttons PR, check in on some of the PRs we needed to check in on (including tables)
[15:17:58] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: breakpoint, meter
[15:18:30] <sfrisk> kristyjy: SCSS Styleguide
[15:18:34] <sfrisk> arschmitz: be awesome
[15:18:41] <sfrisk> and do stuff on all the other projects you're on
[15:18:42] <geekman-rohit> doom doom doom doom
[15:18:55] <arschmitz> im  never going to get that done...
[15:19:05] <sfrisk> :-p
[15:21:04] <sfrisk> and on that note, happy coding everyone!
[15:21:11] <sfrisk> see you in #css-chassis
