[09:04:29] <arschmitz> i think we need to re teach bot
[09:04:29] <fnagel> hey
[09:04:45] <arschmitz> i think when they took him down he forgot out commands
[09:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[09:05:59] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz fnagel jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers_ scott_gonzalez tjvantoll
[09:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> I probably missed someone.
[09:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you have anything to mention/discuss related to the jquery-git breakages?
[09:08:04] <arschmitz> just waiting for core to fix the issue with offset
[09:08:10] <arschmitz> they decided to revert
[09:08:52] <arschmitz> though i need to check if there are any new breakages i noticed last week a new one on mobile and need to check if it effects UI
[09:09:20] <arschmitz> though need to figure out exactly WHAT it is first lol
[09:09:28] <arschmitz> i think they are trying for one a week
[09:09:34] <arschmitz> :-p
[09:10:43] <arschmitz> to be clear they are not reverting the change to how window is handled
[09:10:48] <arschmitz> in offset
[09:10:54] <arschmitz> just hidden / detached elements
[09:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you're still planning on sending a PR for the window update, right?
[09:11:28] <arschmitz> yes
[09:11:37] <arschmitz> ill do it after the meeting its one line
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> Let's talk about AMD in demos.
[09:13:40] <arschmitz> ok
[09:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> The changes in jquery-ui look good.
[09:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> Just some minor comments on the PR.
[09:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> Also just some minor things for jqueryui.com update.
[09:14:47] <arschmitz> yup
[09:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you want to have https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/114 land first?
[09:15:09] <arschmitz> either way
[09:15:32] <arschmitz> i tested locally by just manually changing the needed lines
[09:15:41] <arschmitz> all that does is make that eaiser
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I noticed since they're in the PR :-P
[09:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/113/files#diff-35b4a816e0441e6a375cd925af50752cR99
[09:16:18] <arschmitz> oh ha lol
[09:16:29] <arschmitz> yeah i fixed that several times
[09:16:35] <arschmitz> but kept un fixing to test
[09:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well if #114 works for you, go ahead and land that so you can update #113.
[09:17:16] <arschmitz> cool
[09:17:17] <arschmitz> will do
[09:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't reviewed #114, but if it looks good to you, go for it.
[09:17:32] <arschmitz> ok ill check it out
[09:17:43] <arschmitz> and ill go ahead with updating the rest of the demos
[09:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good
[09:18:15] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Just to make sure it's not forgotten, what about the datepicker rebase (AMD for Globalize)?
[09:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it on my list, right after finishing the button review.
[09:18:40] <fnagel> cool
[09:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> I've just been very busy transitioning to my new job.
[09:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry it's taking so long.
[09:19:05] <arschmitz> totally understandable i think
[09:19:11] <fnagel> Sure!
[09:19:22] <fnagel> No hurry
[09:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I promised Birkir that I'd get datepicker updated so he could do accessibility reviews.
[09:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> And it's been a while, so I should really get that done for both of you :-)
[09:21:39] <arschmitz> speaking of button scott_gonzalez you were on the webaim thread not great feedback there
[09:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, really no resolution at atll.
[09:22:00] <arschmitz> one for and one against the label activating
[09:22:06] <arschmitz> and one that had no idea
[09:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> Let's reach out to the Fluid team and see what they say.
[09:22:26] <arschmitz> ok
[09:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ping me after the meeting if you need contact info.
[09:22:36] <arschmitz> ok will do
[09:22:57] <fnagel> uhhh a11y checks for datepicker. I didn't manage the last feedback we got (wiki changes). Well, we'll see :-)
[09:23:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: speaking of it would be great if Birkir could go through the new button checkboxradio controlgroup just to make sure there are no issues
[09:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. When I let him know that I've dropped the ball on datepicker, I'll ask him about button :-P
[09:24:19] <arschmitz> i fixed all the open issues on any of that stuff and they are very simple now so i dont expect any but you never know
[09:24:28] <arschmitz> lol
[09:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else we need to discuss today?
[09:26:10] <arschmitz> i updated my spinner pr
[09:26:17] <arschmitz> based on your comments
[09:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I can look at that again.
[09:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> Can you just comment on it so it shows up in my inbox again?
[09:27:23] <arschmitz> thats all i have
[09:27:24] <arschmitz> yup
[09:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone else have anything to discuss?
[09:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.

[10:06:42] <agcolom> Kris pushed his branch for the new foundation pages, so I can pick up from there. Crazy at work until end of the week with subject boards...
[10:07:33] <agcolom> Let's talk about what's been hapenning in hte last 4 weeks
[10:08:28] <AurelioDeRosa_> Yes. I've just added a question to the agenda. Anne feel free to rewrite it properly
[10:09:56] <agcolom> Sorry I got disconnected!
[10:09:57] <agcolom> My internet connection has been v bad recently :-(
[10:09:58] <agcolom> if anyone said anything, I missed it...
[10:10:14] <AurelioDeRosa_> Yes. I've just added a question to the agenda. Anne feel free to rewrite it properly
[10:10:22] <AurelioDeRosa_> that was the only new message
[10:10:39] <agcolom> Yes, I'll ask Kris for that
[10:10:56] <agcolom> Also, the whole jQuery Team is nominated for the netawards!
[10:10:58] <agcolom> yay!
[10:11:06] <arthurvr> woohooo!

[10:11:37] <kswedberg> awesome!
[10:11:45] <arthurvr> woohooo twice :)
[10:12:12] <agcolom> https://thenetawards.com/vote/team/the-jquery-team/
[10:12:25] <agcolom> and

[10:12:46] <AurelioDeRosa_> That's awesome
[10:13:17] <AurelioDeRosa_> Arthur, I didn't see you were in the list!
[10:13:48] <agcolom> yes! it's very well deserved as well!
[10:13:55] <agcolom> Please spread the word :-)
[10:14:08] <agcolom> the 5 with the most votes will make the shortlist
[10:14:19] <agcolom> so this part is public votes
[10:14:29] <AurelioDeRosa_> Yes. Congratulations!
[10:14:43] <agcolom> next on the agenda: Should we update code examples on the sites to use the latest jQuery JavaScript style guide?
[10:14:48] <agcolom> I'd say yes
[10:14:59] <arthurvr> I added that. The hard thing is that we don’t have tooling atm.
[10:15:15] <arthurvr> I could build that tooling though. Parsing the markdown + esformatter can’t be too difficult.
[10:15:18] <agcolom> We should definitely adhere to our own style guides
[10:15:36] <arthurvr> yeah, we always did, it’s mainly the recent changes.
[10:16:12] <agcolom> Can jscs help?
[10:16:14] <AurelioDeRosa_> I agree. Let's use the new style
[10:16:46] <AurelioDeRosa_> Yes, definitely can.
[10:16:48] <arthurvr> agcolom: esformatter did the job at mobile
[10:16:53] <agcolom> ok.
[10:17:04] <AurelioDeRosa_> Actually it has the autofix feature now so everything can be automatically done for us
[10:17:07] <kswedberg> agcolom: as far as I know, jscs can only report the problems, not automagically transform.
[10:17:16] <arthurvr> jscs can too but the feature to update code style is still experimental.
[10:17:19] <kswedberg> AurelioDeRosa_: jscs?
[10:17:30] <AurelioDeRosa_> they have introduced the feature a couple of release ago, so JSCS now has autofix as well
[10:17:30] <agcolom> kswedberg: yes, that's my understanding also
[10:17:41] <kswedberg> cool! looking forward to using that. :)
[10:17:43] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa_: oh really?
[10:18:05] <arthurvr> agcolom: yep though still kinda considered expermental from what I understood.
[10:18:21] <agcolom> ok, I'd say whatever works best
[10:18:26] <AurelioDeRosa_> Here's the link at the issue:  https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/issues/516
[10:19:20] <arthurvr> Well it’s kinda stupid that none of the tooling is able to parse our xml and update that.
[10:19:39] <arthurvr> for the markdown it should be as easy as a regex and a call to esformatter/jscs.
[10:20:04] <arthurvr> I wonder if somebody didn’t already build that. If not I think we should :p
[10:21:06] <agcolom> may be worth asking scott_gonzalez about this.
[10:21:06] <AurelioDeRosa_> That could be a nice open source project. Do we have the resources for that?
[10:21:08] <agcolom> we only have us and our free time for now
[10:21:20] <arthurvr> I could could do it for markdown as I would use it on a few hunderd other node modules :p
[10:21:39] <arthurvr> though for the api sites, I have no idea how to handle that.
[10:22:17] <agcolom> I did that all manually one summer ;-) for jQuery core ;-)
[10:22:30] <arthurvr> agcolom: really? wow
[10:22:47] <agcolom> yes... I think it was summer last year ?
[10:22:52] <agcolom> While sunbathing...
[10:23:02] <arthurvr> fun job :p
[10:23:16] <agcolom> or the year before, I can't remember...
[10:23:23] <AurelioDeRosa_> The life of developers, isn't it?
[10:23:29] <agcolom> I think it was 2013
[10:23:36] <agcolom> yes ;-)
[10:24:00] <agcolom> I need to go through the mobile api site because I never got round to it.
[10:24:17] <agcolom> I'd say Scott will probably take care of the ui api site
[10:24:48] <agcolom> but if we have a tool, then it'd be great
[10:24:57] <arthurvr> Before I used to do it with a fancy 100 lines of vim script but I feel like there should be a better solution out there now :p
[10:25:01] <agcolom> and a time saver in the long-term
[10:25:33] <agcolom> The question is, can everything be automated?
[10:25:38] <arthurvr> what agcolom said. Also the fact that this might be handy in other projects (the markdown thing at least)
[10:26:16] <agcolom> ok, so if arthurvr is happy to give this a go, then I think it could be good for the long term?
[10:26:21] <agcolom> What do you think"
[10:26:22] <agcolom> ?
[10:26:28] <arthurvr> agcolom: I think we should just automate it and review it ‘by hand’. If you mean if tools can automate all of the jQuery style guide, yes.
[10:26:35] <arthurvr> SGTM.
[10:26:41] <kswedberg> +1
[10:26:55] <agcolom> perfect
[10:27:13] <AurelioDeRosa_> +1
[10:28:34] <agcolom> Do you have anything else to discuss?
[10:29:11] <arthurvr> So I’ll try to work on that this week and for the rest I have some learn.jquery.com articles to finish.
[10:29:43] <arthurvr> Also, I’ll try to give api.jquery.com some love.
[10:29:47] <AurelioDeRosa_> I don't personally
[10:29:56] <arthurvr> That’s it for me.
[10:30:03] <agcolom> Excellent!
[10:30:33] <agcolom> And we're still doing ok on issues! So thanks everyone on keeping up the good work!!!!
[10:30:55] <AurelioDeRosa_> Great work everyone. It has been nice to catch up again.
[10:31:07] <AurelioDeRosa_> See you next time. :)
[10:31:11] <agcolom> Yes, Sorry for being sooooo busy atm!
[10:31:22] <agcolom> Thanks everyone!
