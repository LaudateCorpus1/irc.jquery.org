[09:08:41] <rwaldron> Hi!
[09:08:54] <rwaldron> Can someone take meeting notes?
[09:08:55] <timmywil> dave just emailed us. he has an agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit?hl=en&pli=1
[09:09:33] <rwaldron> It's an agenda
[09:09:35] <rwaldron> so...
[09:09:44] <rwaldron> the 2.0.3 data bug is fixed
[09:09:46] <rwaldron> ok to land?
[09:10:56] <timmywil> rwaldron: I'd say yes
[09:11:08] <m_gol> me too
[09:12:01] <m_gol> ouch, do we change the pragma to //# now?
[09:12:04] <m_gol> just saw
[09:12:11] <m_gol> ?13983
[09:12:24] <timmywil> I don't think we should until next version
[09:12:28] <m_gol> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13983
[09:12:37] <timmywil> should land in stable browsers first
[09:12:40] <m_gol> yeah, O agree
[09:12:42] <m_gol> * I agree
[09:12:50] <m_gol> the warning's just a warning
[09:13:05] <m_gol> although who knows how many tickets this will produce
[09:13:07] <timmywil> as for see ?13976
[09:13:31] <timmywil> dave marked it fixed, but it is still open
[09:13:42] <timmywil> (marked in the agenda that is)
[09:14:03] <timmywil> do we want to land anything for that in 2.0.3?
[09:14:06] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13976
[09:14:17] <m_gol> I don't see it marked fixed, did you correct it?
[09:14:24] <m_gol> ah, this one
[09:15:20] <timmywil> I'd navigate towards not throwing an error, since we don't in 1.x
[09:15:32] <m_gol> I agree, we should keep consistent behavior
[09:16:56] <timmywil> ok, I made a comment to that effect
[09:17:48] <timmywil> I'm fine with Monday as a release date. Does that sound good to everyone?
[09:18:32] <m_gol> after the next meeting?
[09:18:51] <timmywil> yea
[09:19:17] <timmywil> I'm also working on some build tweaks. I'll have them by Monday
[09:19:21] <timmywil> and npm
[09:19:45] <m_gol> Dave asked to limit changes to these releases
[09:19:51] <m_gol> so that they're stable for a few months
[09:19:59] <m_gol> but npm version is long overdue
[09:20:06] <timmywil> I won't be doing anything big
[09:20:20] <m_gol> as for build tweaks, I have 2 pull requests only to the build process to master & 1.x-master
[09:20:35] <timmywil> the tweaks are for exports options, which will give us a build for npm that excludes anything but module.exports
[09:21:08] <timmywil> after that, I'll be doing AMD, but that's for 2.1/1.11
[09:21:22] <timmywil> so that will stay out of master for now
[09:21:33] <m_gol> seems fine
[09:21:46] <rwaldron> landing that patch then
[09:21:59] <m_gol> I have these tweaks but they can wait for the next 2.0.x or 2.1 I guess: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1282
[09:22:07] <m_gol> rwaldron: +1
[09:22:31] <timmywil> m_gol: yea we can land that after release
[09:23:25] <rwaldron> m_gol: timmywil all set
[09:25:16] <timmywil> that should be it
[09:25:38] <rwaldron> oh one thing not on the list
[09:25:46] <rwaldron> real quick, I closed this
[09:25:47] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14042
[09:25:52] <rwaldron> it seemed "scary"
[09:25:59] <rwaldron> but turns out this has always been true
[09:26:03] <rwaldron> ok, that's all
[09:26:09] <rwaldron> I'll mention it in the notes
[09:26:21] <rwaldron> ah, timmywil thanks :)
[09:26:29] <timmywil> np :)
[09:27:35] <timmywil> cool, closing up
[09:27:44] <m_gol> ultra-fast meeting ;)
