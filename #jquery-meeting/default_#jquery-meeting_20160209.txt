[14:00:27] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:00:35] <sfrisk> arschmitz, kristjy geekman-rohit
[14:01:09] <arschmitz> hi
[14:01:11] <sfrisk> oops, didn't unmute
[14:01:18] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:01:20] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:01:48] <sfrisk> So I did another pass on the visual side of the buttons PR
[14:01:54] <sfrisk> and how complex we could get with variables
[14:02:15] <sfrisk> Also, along that line, tweaking the palette colors a bit - which I still need to update in that PR
[14:02:20] <sfrisk> but if people like that I can pull it in
[14:02:27] <kristyjy> hi
[14:02:46] <geekman-rohit> the buttons look good,
[14:02:54] <geekman-rohit> bold, a little matrialistic, and good
[14:03:08] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/96-buttons-take-two/demos/buttons.html
[14:03:26] <sfrisk> there is some opinionated stuff in there, but should be easy enough to tweak with the variables
[14:03:51] <geekman-rohit> capitalizing is fairly common in buttons
[14:04:24] <arschmitz> yeah im not sure on the caps but it is some what common
[14:04:30] <geekman-rohit> if we pull the colors in, I can rebase and redo all my PRs this week to use the color thingy
[14:07:01] <sfrisk> do people like the colors?  I went with some of the colors on https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette, and made sure the base styling was one of the ones that had white letters for the hex number, not black
[14:07:09] <sfrisk> so hopefully that should help with contrasting
[14:07:40] <geekman-rohit> But the buttons are strongly inspired by material design
[14:08:04] <geekman-rohit> I like it and use it a lot.. the subtle shadow, minute border radius, bold colors, capitalization
[14:08:34] <kristyjy> yeah they look good
[14:08:43] <geekman-rohit> very good
[14:08:55] <sfrisk> the shadow does make it VERY obvious if the button is disabled
[14:09:04] <sfrisk> I still need to make sure everything works with <a> tags
[14:09:11] <geekman-rohit> also
[14:09:17] <geekman-rohit> umm the default button
[14:09:20] <sfrisk> yeahhh
[14:09:25] <geekman-rohit> should have more effect on hover
[14:09:34] <sfrisk> I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with that
[14:09:42] <geekman-rohit> a little raising it with slight shade and shadow maybe? on hover
[14:10:04] <sfrisk> I was sorta looking at what material design had done with their 'flat' buttons
[14:10:37] <sfrisk> oh, wait, hovering does stuff
[14:10:41] <sfrisk> okay, I need to add that
[14:11:02] <geekman-rohit> https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/button
[14:11:09] <sfrisk> http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/myvzPO
[14:11:26] <geekman-rohit> https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-button?view=demo:demo/index.html&active=paper-button
[14:11:26] <sfrisk> yeah, apparently I hadn't clicked on any of my buttons I had made months ago when I was looking over this for ideas
[14:11:36] <sfrisk> okay, so I'll add that
[14:11:52] <sfrisk> put the "default" shades into the palette
[14:11:57] <sfrisk> and commit that
[14:12:12] <sfrisk> yell at me tomorrow geekman-rohit if I haven't updated palette
[14:12:22] <geekman-rohit> sure :D
[14:12:29] <geekman-rohit> when can we pull it in?
[14:12:33] <geekman-rohit> the palette
[14:13:01] <sfrisk> if people like the colors I have right now, I could just update it tonight with the buttons colors, and pull in tonight?
[14:13:15] <sfrisk> if we need to change it later we can, but gives everyone something to work with
[14:13:52] <geekman-rohit> sounds good to me
[14:14:08] <sfrisk> Also I'm not sure what I want to do with the css outline on buttons
[14:14:11] <sfrisk> http://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/
[14:14:14] <geekman-rohit> once we a few elements all using same palette
[14:14:19] <sfrisk> I know we technically want to keep it around
[14:14:38] <geekman-rohit> yes, certainly
[14:14:39] <sfrisk> because accessibility is a concern of hours
[14:14:42] <sfrisk> ourS*
[14:14:44] <sfrisk> ours*
[14:14:49] <sfrisk> I cannot type apparently
[14:14:57] <geekman-rohit> no removing outlines on active
[14:15:05] <sfrisk> but the border does make it hard to see some of the subtle effects
[14:15:44] <sfrisk> also not necessarily consistent cross browser
[14:15:54] <sfrisk> since Firefox's outline is VERY different from chrome's
[14:16:05] <geekman-rohit> we should leave it as is I think
[14:16:31] <sfrisk> Leaving as is looks nicer in Firefox than Chrome
[14:16:57] <sfrisk> since their outline only goes into effect if you start using the keyboard
[14:17:00] <geekman-rohit> um
[14:17:04] <sfrisk> not if you're physically clicking on the buttons
[14:20:24] <sfrisk> anyway, I don't know if I want to address it now - since this covers a lot of different things beyond buttons
[14:20:36] <sfrisk> but I think we should have at least consistent active styling across all broweers
[14:20:39] <sfrisk> browsers*
[14:20:45] <sfrisk> if that's styling the outline or what
[14:23:31] <sfrisk> .. I'll create an issue for it
[14:27:26] <sfrisk> Okay, so along the lines of the Button PR
[14:27:54] <sfrisk> I think it probably works as a basic pass at buttons, so we have some examples for our overall style - but there are still some other buttons we should still address
[14:28:16] <sfrisk> Specifically Button Groups
[14:28:21] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/96
[14:28:34] <sfrisk> After that, I think Buttons should in theory be good for comitting
[14:28:54] <sfrisk> and we can start addressing more form elements: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/6
[14:32:50] <sfrisk> hello?
[14:33:16] <sfrisk> Switch the topic to work on the SCSS Style Guide?
[14:33:25] <kristyjy> I'm still here
[14:33:33] <sfrisk> do you have the link to the style guide?
[14:33:44] <kristyjy> I'll grab it
[14:34:10] <kristyjy> https://docs.google.com/document/d/14REmIHA6U4sIlmkqiqCFTRKh0u1rJfPKn8x657bCkOo/edit
[14:34:48] <sfrisk> Okay I know we had a few comments on this, but I don't think any of us have dug into this deeply since we put it on the google doc
[14:36:04] <kristyjy> yeah I haven't had much time for it but maybe this weekend. I'm not sure on my plans just yet but they don't seem to be too big.
[14:36:58] <sfrisk> I think now that we've figured out how we handle variables we should add a section on that
[14:37:24] <geekman-rohit> and certainly not a modified version of BEM
[14:37:44] <geekman-rohit> multiple classes kinda is too major a modification
[14:38:11] <geekman-rohit> we should have like a small descriptiion of our naming convention
[14:38:14] <geekman-rohit> or so I think
[14:38:32] <geekman-rohit> @arschmitz ?
[14:38:48] <sfrisk> BE M!
[14:38:51] <arschmitz> lol
[14:38:57] <arschmitz> yeah its not really bem
[14:39:07] <geekman-rohit> point of bem is single class I think
[14:39:30] <sfrisk> I think regular BEM works well if you have a super defined style guide for a project and you know exactly what your use cases for everything is going to be
[14:39:39] <sfrisk> we're creating a pretty open framework.... makes it harder
[14:39:47] <geekman-rohit> yep!
[14:39:58] <geekman-rohit> but I dont like naming it even BE M
[14:40:06] <geekman-rohit> its just class naming style now
[14:40:10] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:40:45] <geekman-rohit> I gtg!!!
[14:40:52] <sfrisk> bye!
[14:40:57] <geekman-rohit> anyways I am thrilled with those awesome buttons!!
[14:41:23] <sfrisk> Okay so goals for tonight is get palette updated with the new colors and commit that, so people can use that for their PRs
[14:41:44] <sfrisk> I'm going to have the test cases for a, input=button, and button in the PR by next meeting
[14:41:49] <sfrisk> as well as a button bar implementation
[14:41:49] <geekman-rohit> and I'll update typography PR this week and make it ready for a pull in
[14:42:13] <sfrisk> and then everyone contribute to the style guide, let's get the done!
[14:42:32] <kristyjy> okay!
[14:43:14] <sfrisk> If this was sports I would have us all huddle and put our hands in a circle and yell
[14:43:25] <kristyjy> lol GO SPORTS@
[14:43:30] <sfrisk> but this is the internet, and there is too much distance separating all of us
[14:45:49] <sfrisk> Okay, see everyone in #css-channel
[14:45:53] <sfrisk> #css-chassis
[14:46:07] <sfrisk> whatever the name of our channel is
