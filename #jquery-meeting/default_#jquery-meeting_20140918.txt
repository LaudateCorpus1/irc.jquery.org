[11:04:55] <arschmitz> Meeting Time
[11:05:19] <cgack> howdy
[11:05:19] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=44
[11:05:26] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:05:56] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:06:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:07:36] <ldeluca> howdy, I'm new but here to listen in
[11:07:52] <jasperdegroot> hi Ideluca
[11:07:54] <arschmitz> ldeluca: welcome
[11:08:03] <arschmitz> ldeluca: i think most of us saw your talk last week :)
[11:08:27] <agcolom> Hi ldeluca :-)
[11:08:40] <arschmitz> ldeluca: if you have any suggestions or input feel free to speak up!
[11:08:51] <jasperdegroot> ah the cordova talk, right?
[11:09:41] <ldeluca> yea :)
[11:10:02] <jasperdegroot> nice!
[11:10:13] <arschmitz> ok so lets get started with 1.4.5
[11:10:41] <arschmitz> lets not plan on doing 1.4.5 unless anything major pops up we need to focus on 1.5 which is coming up very very fast
[11:10:56] <arschmitz> lets be good about cherry picking and maybe do one later
[11:11:03] <jasperdegroot> +1
[11:11:06] <arschmitz> but i would like all efforts for now to be on 1.5
[11:11:29] <jasperdegroot> so let's also not use the milestone in the issue tracker
[11:11:38] <jasperdegroot> people will expect a 1.4.5 if we do
[11:11:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I've used it on a few issues ... I think 2 so far.
[11:12:13] <gabriel_schulhof> 4, including the two bumps from 1.4.4.
[11:12:18] <jasperdegroot> then it's not much work to replace them by 1.5 :)
[11:12:18] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah im ok with that
[11:12:34] <arschmitz> so moving on to 1.5
[11:12:42] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:13:08] <arschmitz> there is now a branch ui-1-12
[11:13:16] <arschmitz> which pulls in the button branch from ui
[11:13:21] <arschmitz> which includes classes
[11:13:26] <arschmitz> so basicly everything we care about
[11:14:08] <arschmitz> lets start doing prs against this branch
[11:14:17] <arschmitz> for our individual parts we are working on
[11:14:45] <arschmitz> so jasperdegroot update css for icons and new widgets
[11:14:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: implementing classes option in current widgets
[11:15:17] <jasperdegroot> I can rebase the icon-span branch
[11:15:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Woah ... OK, ... do you want me to rebase the table review against that branch?
[11:15:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Is that branch up-to-date wrt. our master?
[11:16:01] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, it is.
[11:16:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Only one commit behind..
[11:16:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[11:16:22] <arschmitz> oh i thought i rebased first guess i missed one
[11:16:52] <arschmitz> so tables dont worry about for now it can land before or after
[11:17:01] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:17:05] <cgack> same with navbar?
[11:17:08] <arschmitz> yes
[11:17:22] <arschmitz> updates for classes are pretty simple
[11:17:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... waht's the point of redoing all our widgets with classes, if we're gonna drop them.
[11:17:40] <jasperdegroot> I think we should remove buttonMarkup.js ASAP
[11:17:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, for example, popup ...
[11:17:46] <arschmitz> and anyone can work on adding it to a widget and adding a commit
[11:17:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Amen!
[11:18:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: because this option needs to be in every widget or its not usefull
[11:18:19] <arschmitz> part of it is so you can change your whole theme basicly
[11:18:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Right ... hmmm ... OK ...
[11:18:46] <arschmitz> this will be an option guranteed by the factory like disabled
[11:19:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, yeah ...
[11:19:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and the updates are very simple
[11:19:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright ... I'll take popup for now ...
[11:19:38] <arschmitz> its basicly replace "ui-button" any where it is with this._classes( "ui-button" );
[11:19:40] <arschmitz> or similar
[11:19:47] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll make an issue for popup.
[11:19:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: lets make an issue for every widget
[11:19:58] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll move on to another widget afterwards.
[11:20:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. That was my plan.
[11:20:09] <arschmitz> any one that wants can assign or comment to claim one
[11:21:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Should we maybe have a temporary label so we can easily see which widget has gone how far?
[11:21:59] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or we can simply use "classes option" somewhere in the issue title.
[11:22:19] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:22:26] <arschmitz> i dont think we need a label
[11:22:56] <jasperdegroot> "[widget name]: Add classes option" will do I think
[11:24:17] <gabriel_schulhof> +1
[11:24:40] <cgack> is there a time when we hope to land all the widgets with classes option on ui-1-12
[11:24:55] <arschmitz> cgack: ldeluca: feel free to check out the new option and help :-)
[11:25:05] <arschmitz> cgack: we plan to release 1.5 and just over a month
[11:25:10] <cgack> so ASAP
[11:25:34] <arschmitz> yup
[11:27:47] <arschmitz> ok so other things we want to land in 1.5
[11:27:52] <arschmitz> navbar
[11:27:56] <arschmitz> and tables
[11:28:04] <arschmitz> those are both probably 90% at this point?
[11:28:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. I've already tested tables to death.
[11:28:21] <gabriel_schulhof> I think the PR's ready for a thorough review (read: thrashing).
[11:28:40] <arschmitz> lol oj
[11:28:55] <cgack> yeah, I think we need another merge from my navbar branch PR
[11:29:40] <jasperdegroot> cgack: merge what?
[11:29:43] <arschmitz> ok
[11:29:52] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: pr into branch
[11:30:36] <jasperdegroot> ah ok, forgot cgack is working in a fork
[11:30:46] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup for not
[11:30:48] <arschmitz> now
[11:30:55] <jasperdegroot> this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7473
[11:31:12] <cgack> yes
[11:31:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Whew! A lot less wild than the previous PR :)
[11:32:02] <gabriel_schulhof> PRs are ill-suited for lengthy work on a branch.
[11:32:06] <arschmitz> ok so other things we should TRY to land
[11:32:20] <arschmitz> removing custom data-attributes
[11:32:32] <arschmitz> and namspacing everything with ui
[11:32:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait ... "custom data-attributes"?
[11:32:44] <gabriel_schulhof> What are those?
[11:32:45] <jasperdegroot> I think we still have a lot of deprecated code removal to do
[11:32:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: data-foo-option
[11:33:02] <arschmitz> data-bar-option
[11:33:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Wha ... ?
[11:33:09] <arschmitz> jqmData
[11:33:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh.
[11:33:41] <gabriel_schulhof> We'll keep our custom getCreateOptions though, right?
[11:34:14] <arschmitz> yes
[11:34:22] <arschmitz> it just will only check data-ui-
[11:34:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Ooooooh, now I get it.
[11:35:05] <arschmitz> you wont be able to change the name space anymore
[11:35:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. Good.
[11:35:20] <arschmitz> it will be fixed to ui
[11:35:22] <gabriel_schulhof> We can simplify our tests too.
[11:35:50] <arschmitz> it also makes them usable as selectors if needed
[11:36:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Riiight! We had a few places where that was holding us back.
[11:36:22] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:36:32] <jasperdegroot> I am trying to remember what and where
[11:37:05] <gabriel_schulhof> I remember having this conversation with Wilto and the whole topic was shut down by our inability to select by attribute.
[11:37:20] <gabriel_schulhof> FWLIW
[11:38:10] <arschmitz> the other thing i would like to see is pulling autoinit out of page
[11:38:22] <gabriel_schulhof> That's gonna ba tricky.
[11:38:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Ideally, all widgets should AMD-depend on it.
[11:38:39] <arschmitz> and into its own module only dependent on the widget factory
[11:38:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no they should not
[11:39:02] <arschmitz> they in now way depend on it
[11:39:07] <arschmitz> its 100% optional
[11:39:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, a good place for it would be the same place as getCreateOptions.
[11:39:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that was my plan
[11:39:50] <arschmitz> they are both declaritive widget init
[11:39:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[11:39:59] <arschmitz> and are essentilly only usefull together
[11:40:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Exactly.
[11:40:39] <arschmitz> enhancewithin autoinit and getcreateoptions should all be together
[11:40:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: declarative.js
[11:41:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Might actually be useful on its own.
[11:41:39] <arschmitz> im going to talk to tj_vantoll about this https://github.com/tjvantoll/declarative-widgets
[11:41:43] <gabriel_schulhof> You could drop it into a jQuery UI project and Bam!
[11:41:50] <arschmitz> he pulled it out already in his own repo
[11:43:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... he did it without getCreateOptions!
[11:43:28] <arschmitz> no he didnt
[11:43:36] <arschmitz> https://github.com/tjvantoll/declarative-widgets/blob/master/declarative-widgets.js#L31
[11:43:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK. I just read the README.
[11:44:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because it might be possible without getCreateOptions.
[11:44:34] <gabriel_schulhof> You simply grab the options at the point where you $( theElement )[ widgetName ]({ /* options you've grabbed */ });
[11:45:01] <arschmitz> im not sure i see the point?
[11:45:08] <gabriel_schulhof> You know what options to look for because of Object.keys( $.ui[ widgetName ].prototype.options )
[11:45:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No need to extend the widget factory.
[11:45:26] <jasperdegroot> maybe this is more a discussion for -dev
[11:45:33] <gabriel_schulhof> But OK. Whatever. Same diff.
[11:45:55] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Yep. It is.
[11:46:48] <arschmitz> ok so this is a lot already so these should be our goals for 1.5
[11:47:17] <arschmitz> moving on unless someone has something else
[11:47:35] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm good.
[11:48:00] <arschmitz> ok so cross browser automated testing
[11:48:13] <arschmitz> there was talk and progress on this last week
[11:48:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[11:48:46] <arschmitz> there is a plan to move forward potentially through something using browserstack runner
[11:49:05] <arschmitz> which may actually work now with updates done by jzaefferer
[11:49:12] <jasperdegroot> ok nice
[11:49:35] <arschmitz> workers can now be re-used
[11:49:42] <arschmitz> before every file used its own worker
[11:49:48] <arschmitz> and every browser
[11:49:55] <arschmitz> so they multiplied very quickly
[11:50:04] <arschmitz> and you hit the open file limit
[11:50:21] <arschmitz> this will also improve test speed
[11:50:38] <arschmitz> but i have not got a chance to test this yet so we will see
[11:51:04] <gabriel_schulhof> We will soooo have to write new tests.
[11:51:21] <arschmitz> iv been thinking talking about that as well
[11:51:29] <arschmitz> and getting rid of all our timeouts
[11:51:47] <arschmitz> every last one in the tests :)
[11:51:48] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and nav tests ... man ... I dunno how we'll ever get those to pass everywhere, all the time.
[11:52:07] <arschmitz> because tests can return promises now
[11:52:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, there need to be failsafe timeouts in case events fail to fire when they're supposed to fire.
[11:52:19] <arschmitz> and ajax of course uses a deffered
[11:52:36] <arschmitz> so we can hook into these and not need to worry about a timeout
[11:53:36] <arschmitz> our pagecontainer methods also return defferds
[11:54:03] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, but again, how do you deal with a situation where you wish to assert that an event is triggered?
[11:54:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we can talk about this more in dev
[11:54:38] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:54:44] <arschmitz> but its something we should not worry about until 1.6
[11:54:56] <arschmitz> we need to focus on 1.5 for now
[11:55:12] <arschmitz> last builder
[11:55:23] <arschmitz> we still want to share the ui builder
[11:55:32] <arschmitz> but css paths are currently a blocker
[11:55:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Oooh! We have a nice builder bug!
[11:55:38] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:55:50] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/issues/103
[11:55:50] <arschmitz> rxaviers: and gseguin|away: talked about this
[11:56:04] <arschmitz> we are going to switch to requirecss under the hood
[11:56:16] <arschmitz> but pipe into it from the meta comments we already use
[11:56:27] <arschmitz> so we dont force its use on everyone that uses amd
[11:57:09] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:57:58] <arschmitz> oh one more css related 1.5 thing
[11:58:17] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: what do you think about switching to use the classes from ui and just add them to our rules
[11:58:29] <arschmitz> then we dont need to change the classes option
[11:58:58] <arschmitz> so replace ui-btn with ui-button etc
[11:59:48] <jasperdegroot> actually I thought that was already the plan because we adapt those widgets
[12:00:29] <arschmitz> ok cool
[12:00:33] <jasperdegroot> but we have to do the same in other widgets for consistency
[12:00:42] <arschmitz> we had originally talked about useing classes option
[12:00:56] <jasperdegroot> didn't think of that before
[12:00:56] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[12:01:09] <arschmitz> but i think we should change our css instead
[12:01:20] <jasperdegroot> I agree
[12:01:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Ideally we shouldn't be using the classes option for our own purposes.
[12:01:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[12:01:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Put the backcompat in the CSS.
[12:02:10] <jasperdegroot> that means two selectors during one version?
[12:02:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[12:02:29] <jasperdegroot> hmm
[12:02:37] <jasperdegroot> do we have to?
[12:02:38] <gabriel_schulhof> There's no other way to rename a class, right?
[12:02:45] <jasperdegroot> just rename
[12:02:56] <jasperdegroot> is a class name something we have to deprecate?
[12:03:06] <gabriel_schulhof> I think so.
[12:03:23] <jasperdegroot> we didn't do that when we changed some in the panel widget
[12:03:34] <jasperdegroot> people can use the classes option if they want the old class name
[12:03:50] <jasperdegroot> think of the theme CSS
[12:04:00] <jasperdegroot> problems with the ThemeRoller
[12:04:02] <arschmitz> he dont have good documentaton of our structure or classes currently
[12:04:44] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: IINM, you can't use the classes option that way.
[12:04:45] <jasperdegroot> and of course the file size
[12:05:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you can add any class you want to any element
[12:05:10] <arschmitz> and i dont think we need both
[12:05:22] <arschmitz> its super simple for anyone to add the class or upgrade if they need
[12:05:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, but if the class has no rules associated with it, it will have no effect.
[12:05:33] <arschmitz> search and replace ui-btn with ui-button in your css
[12:05:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The way jasperdegroot put it, ui-btn would have to be in the key, not the value.
[12:05:58] <jasperdegroot> no, it would be the value
[12:06:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no you do ui-button: ui-btn
[12:06:07] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm OK with not doing a deprecation period - don't get me wrong.
[12:06:10] <arschmitz> then your custom css still works
[12:06:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right. Your custom CSS.
[12:06:29] <arschmitz> because ui have ui-btn to target everywhere you have ui-button
[12:06:41] <jasperdegroot> but I think we should simple recommend people to do a search and replace
[12:06:46] <arschmitz> and really why not just search and replace ui-btn and ui-button in your css and js
[12:06:49] <jasperdegroot> in their custom CSS
[12:06:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Actually, duuuh! The way it is in ui-1-12, our whole CSS /is/ custom CSS from the jQuery UI perspective.
[12:06:54] <arschmitz> it takes like 1/10th of a second
[12:07:00] <jasperdegroot> + JS
[12:08:02] <gabriel_schulhof> I dunno though ... there's also ui-btn-* ...
[12:08:11] <arschmitz> so i dont think we need backcompat for this is a super simple change
[12:08:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Are the classes really, wholly one-to-one?
[12:08:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: which we will change for consistency
[12:08:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait! We can document that if they don't want to search and replace, they can overwrite the classes option during mobileinit.
[12:09:21] <gabriel_schulhof> They'd put the same stuff in their mobileinit that's currently inside the ui-1-12 branch in button.js.
[12:09:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also the actual strucutre of the widgets will be changing
[12:09:27] <arschmitz> so much custom css wont work no matter what
[12:09:40] <jasperdegroot> true
[12:09:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[12:09:50] <jasperdegroot> people just need to upgrade
[12:10:02] <gabriel_schulhof> OK then ... let's make a clean break.
[12:11:00] <jasperdegroot> only one problem... upgrading 1.4 custom theme to 1.5 with the ThemeRoller :/
[12:11:15] <arschmitz> yeah that might be ugly
[12:11:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Much work on TR
[12:11:24] <jasperdegroot> yes
[12:11:42] <arschmitz> why on earth do we allow upgrades lol
[12:11:46] <jasperdegroot> lol
[12:11:49] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[12:11:59] <jasperdegroot> we should only do 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 releases ;-)
[12:12:06] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[12:12:53] <gabriel_schulhof> You know, this whole API break thing is not the end of the world, as long as what breaks is well and exhaustively documented - which is not easy to do.
[12:13:28] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[12:13:33] <jasperdegroot> we need good upgrade guide
[12:13:47] <arschmitz> well we have almost no documentation of our classes and structure currently
[12:13:51] <arschmitz> so yeah...
[12:14:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, as far as structure is concerned, all the enhanced option documentation actually documents the structure.
[12:14:30] <arschmitz> ah yeah forgot that
[12:14:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and we have pages/classes.html
[12:14:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Or don't we?
[12:15:13] <gabriel_schulhof> No, wait ... what was I thinking about ...
[12:15:22] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do we have more to discuss? (dinner time here in spain :D )
[12:16:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: In our demos we have lots of "View Source" which shows how to create a button-like anchor with our button classes.
[12:16:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Dunno if that counts as docs.
[12:16:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway ...
[12:16:59] <arschmitz> no we are good i think
[12:17:06] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ^^
[12:17:14] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:17:14] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else?
[12:17:19] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm good.
[12:17:28] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[12:18:00] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back on -dev
[12:18:07] <jasperdegroot> later
