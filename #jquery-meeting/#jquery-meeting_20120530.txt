[08:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> .
[08:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...was this channel never muted?
[09:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> hey everyone
[09:03:03] <jzaefferer> Its not like there's monkey's around the corner that are just waiting for the channel to be left unmuted...
[09:03:24] <jzaefferer> pinging kborchers danheberden gnarf
[09:03:36] <kborchers> echo reply
[09:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I think there might be, actually :-)
[09:04:10] <jzaefferer> also paul_irish, maybe he can tell us how to get UI and the Google CDN
[09:04:15] <jzaefferer> 1.8.20 is still not there
[09:04:45] <gnarf> hey hey
[09:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.21 is coming soon too...
[09:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's get started
[09:05:52] <gnarf> is it just me or do we run into this "wait for google CDN" problem too often?
[09:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Want to give an update on api.jqueryui.com?
[09:06:00] <jzaefferer> Sure
[09:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If too often = every release, then yes
[09:06:10] <jzaefferer> If you've got the hosts entry, http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/ should be working
[09:06:26] <jzaefferer> The index is crap, but the content itself is somewhat working
[09:06:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: updated agenda?
[09:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> And that hosts entry would be 205.186.144.58 stage.api.jqueryui.com
[09:06:37] <kborchers> or just winging it :)
[09:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's updated.
[09:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> I was prepared this week :-)
[09:07:00] <jzaefferer> Generally we've got docs for both 1.8 and 1.9
[09:07:11] <jzaefferer> New docs for menu, spinner and tooltip
[09:07:20] <jzaefferer> Overhauled accordion and tabs to match redesigns
[09:07:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh, weird. had to expand the little box to see the latest version
[09:07:28] <jzaefferer> Widget is very much incomplete, still
[09:07:57] <jzaefferer> We need to document _bind et al somewhere, not exactly sure where/how
[09:08:16] <jzaefferer> Though 1.8 doesn't have any widget API docs, so its not getting worse
[09:09:01] <jzaefferer> mhm, this is still old 1.8 tabs api: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/2012/05/25/tabs/
[09:09:16] <jzaefferer> I have no idea how the deployment works for staging
[09:09:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is that supposed to be a post, not a page?
[09:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what's planned for post vs. page on api sites.
[09:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps rworth can provide some insight when he's around.
[09:10:19] <jzaefferer> Any thoughts on widget docs?
[09:10:20] <gnarf> deployment jzaefferer?
[09:10:38] <jzaefferer> We've got all the inheritated methods in each widget's file, so widget.xml can contain the internal API?
[09:10:42] <jzaefferer> _bind, _trigger...
[09:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe something like http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[09:11:17] <jzaefferer> gnarf: how do I update stage.api.jqueryui.com with what's on the github repo for that?
[09:11:50] <gnarf> jzaefferer: eventual plan is to monitor pushes to github and auto update stage
[09:12:07] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we wouldn't want to have individual files for each method, right?
[09:12:10] <gnarf> current plan is checking out the repo and running the grunt deploy stage or whatever
[09:12:37] <jzaefferer> gnarf: okay, I'll just nag Richard about that as well
[09:12:39] <gnarf> not sure how scott_gonzalez had that "push via wordpress" grunt task setup
[09:13:03] <gnarf> to update "live" we will either be using a tagged version or a branch
[09:13:07] <gnarf> not 100% sure yet
[09:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's just `grunt wordpress-deploy`
[09:13:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: and stage vs normal is just a config option?
[09:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> config.json points at a specific WP install.
[09:14:13] <gnarf> sounds good
[09:14:26] <jzaefferer> so I need a config.json with db details for the staging server?
[09:14:31] <gnarf> so jzaefferer should be able to grunt wordpress-deploy to the staging
[09:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> not db, wp
[09:14:45] <scott_gonzalez> url, username, password for WP
[09:15:00] <gnarf> jzaefferer: do you have a "super" user on the wordpress MU site yet?
[09:15:36] <jzaefferer> I don't think I have an account at all
[09:16:02] <jzaefferer> and I can't register
[09:16:19] <gnarf> jzaefferer: creating one
[09:16:48] <jzaefferer> Okay, let's move on
[09:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on Tabs ARIA
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/666
[09:17:49] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (5d, 15h ago): Tabs: ARIA! DO NOT MERGE TO MASTER!
[09:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> Got lots of good feedback from Hans, so I'm working on that.
[09:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> Hans also reviewed menu, and said everything is working well.
[09:18:49] <gnarf> can't be too careful with a pull numbered 666
[09:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> scottjehl: You around?
[09:19:50] <jzaefferer> Let's see what happens when I push this red buttons...
[09:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer started a discussion with Tim Wood about moment.js and Globalize
[09:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues/315
[09:20:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #315 on moment (jzaefferer; 6d, 23h ago): Explore CLDR for locale database
[09:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like Tim is interested in collaborating.
[09:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> Probably won't make much progress on that until after 1.9, when we start to actually look into CLDR.
[09:23:04] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do the 1.8.21 release soon, either this week or next week.
[09:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> Depends on how busy I get with working on sites.
[09:24:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / danheberden - I'm hoping to have time to get a few more steps down the puppet configs
[09:24:30] <gnarf> today or tomorrow
[09:24:45] <gnarf> work slowed down finally - got that version out yesterday
[09:24:48] <gnarf> no serious bugs
[09:24:56] <gnarf> so crunch time not too bad
[09:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's everything on the agenda.
[09:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:26:37] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:26:41] <kborchers> are we just wating on theme stuff for a decision on progressbar?
[09:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:27:14] <jzaefferer> That's where scottjehl comes in?
[09:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I should send an email to scottjehl with the subject "<picture> vs. <img srcset>" and then ask about the PR :-P
[09:27:31] <kborchers> lol
[09:27:32] <jzaefferer> haha
[09:27:44] <jzaefferer> kborchers: wanna helps with widget API docs?
[09:27:47] <jzaefferer> *help
[09:28:15] <kborchers> sure, i have free hours the next few nights so yeah. just let me know where you want me to work
[09:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: You can also ping kswedberg about ideas for how to document the internals of widget.
[09:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> wow, that was meant for jzaefferer...
[09:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's move any further discussion to -dev
