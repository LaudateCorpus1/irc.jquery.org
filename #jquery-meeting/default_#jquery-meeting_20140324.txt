[09:01:59] <DaveMethvin> gaah, i'm totally behind here
[09:02:06] <DaveMethvin> who's around?
[09:02:23] <timmywil> this guy
[09:02:29] <Iman_> Me
[09:02:42] <markelog> hey
[09:02:54] <Sina_> hey, i'm here too
[09:02:56] <DaveMethvin> okay timmywil and markelog ! that's a start
[09:03:08] <DaveMethvin> sorry guys, i was trying to get a core meeting started here
[09:03:21] <DaveMethvin> Iman_ and Sina_ you're welcome to listen int
[09:05:18] <DaveMethvin> so i think the beta is ready to go ... had it ready late thursday
[09:05:24] <DaveMethvin> but i can't run jquery-relase!
[09:05:28] <m_gol> we have a broken test in IE7
[09:05:34] <DaveMethvin> hey, since when?
[09:05:35] <m_gol> see http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1713098
[09:05:41] <m_gol> since a few commits ago
[09:06:01] <timmywil> ah display
[09:06:11] <DaveMethvin> well let's go with the beta unless someone has an obvious fix
[09:06:14] <timmywil> inline-block will be inline in IE7
[09:06:18] <timmywil> that's a test problem
[09:06:34] <m_gol> timmywil: but this test wasn't touched for 2.5 years!
[09:06:43] <m_gol> according to git blame
[09:06:58] <DaveMethvin> i thought ie7 supported inline block
[09:07:12] <m_gol> it doesn't but I have no idea how this test worked before :)
[09:07:15] <timmywil> ok, but why would we expect "inline-block" in IE7?
[09:07:24] <markelog> http://quirksmode.org/css/css2/display.html
[09:07:40] <m_gol> hmm
[09:07:40] <markelog> inline-block should work on <a>
[09:08:28] <m_gol> we have a span there but it should be the same
[09:08:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's naturally inline
[09:08:43] <timmywil> well, as I understand it, inline in IE7 works like inline-block in modern browsers. Hence why you see *display: inline; in CSS frameworks.
[09:09:09] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/5265cdac3d84b7bb4f8013ef10adaa5a9968fb1c/test/unit/effects.js#L297-309
[09:09:48] <m_gol> this whole test, except the `this.clock.tick` line saw last changes in 2011
[09:10:20] <timmywil> ok, what did we change about default display? I only skimmed it.
[09:10:43] <markelog> two things
[09:10:55] <markelog> one commit is gibson042
[09:11:08] <markelog> and another was mine
[09:11:25] <DaveMethvin> ah what does ie7 return for those cases?
[09:12:46] <markelog> sec
[09:12:46] <m_gol> see http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1713098 - it gets "inline" instead of "inline-block"
[09:12:50] <markelog> need to re-test that
[09:12:58] <timmywil> gibson042: why didn't you set display to the defaultDisplay result when called?
[09:13:25] <timmywil> nvm
[09:13:44] <timmywil> just don't want to call it twice
[09:13:49] <markelog> hm, for me it's falling on all inline elements
[09:13:54] <timmywil> ok, we can assign this
[09:14:26] <timmywil> markelog: you want it?
[09:14:31] <markelog> sec
[09:14:37] <gibson042> looks like it was my fault via https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/80cf965e02e71dc1b11bf8c1b3d216b9ab4e99ac, but can someone catch me up on the nature of the failures?
[09:15:05] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1713098
[09:15:12] <DaveMethvin> returning inline instead of inline-block
[09:15:18] <markelog> yeah, i confirm
[09:15:44] <markelog> it's indeed 80cf965e02e71dc1b11bf8c1b3d216b9ab4e99ac
[09:16:40] <markelog> i can take it, but only in the end of the week
[09:16:52] <gibson042> I can clean it up
[09:16:58] <markelog> ok
[09:17:07] <DaveMethvin> i want to get the beta out, i'm okay with this being broken if needed
[09:17:11] <markelog> this method is tricky
[09:17:20] <m_gol> ok, I can do a release
[09:17:45] <markelog> will it be your first?
[09:18:13] <m_gol> markelog: it would be (except npm); you can do it if you feel more confident
[09:18:20] <timmywil> well, let's give gibson042 a little bit
[09:18:46] <markelog> nah, i think we all should do a release, at least once )
[09:18:55] <gibson042> seconded :)
[09:18:59] <DaveMethvin> either of you would be fine, it's nice to have the knowledge spread around! there have been some changes to jquery-release so you may need to ping jzaefferer or scott_gonzalez  if there are problems
[09:19:36] <DaveMethvin> m_gol i think you already have permissions on the cdn repo right?
[09:20:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: no idea; I have some infra permissions but I don't know if that applies to cdn
[09:20:08] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 you were going to look at the ie7 fail?
[09:20:12] <gibson042> yes
[09:20:15] <DaveMethvin> ok m_gol i'll double check
[09:21:02] <m_gol> gibson042: FWIW, URLs for failing tests in IE7 are: /test/?module=effects&testNumber=648 and /test/?module=effects&testNumber=657
[09:21:16] <m_gol> this browser is slow as hell, better not to run everything :P
[09:21:17] <timmywil> m_gol: Run a test on your own repo first. When you do, force push master on the fake-cdn repo to clear out your test
[09:21:52] <markelog> Just want to say that i'm still busy with the work stuff, but i will do all that i suppose to do today or tomorrow
[09:22:05] <markelog> but next week i'm free as a bird )
[09:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> Whoever does the release should definitely do a test run first.
[09:22:31] <DaveMethvin> ok you're added
[09:22:49] <DaveMethvin> yes, definitely a test run
[09:23:01] <DaveMethvin> i usually push to a branch on my own fork
[09:23:11] <m_gol> sure; what should I do exactly?
[09:23:43] <DaveMethvin> you want to pull jquery-release, then in the root of that give the command like the one in the readme
[09:23:49] <m_gol> ok
[09:24:08] <DaveMethvin> it's actually pretty nice compared to what i used to have to do
[09:24:29] <DaveMethvin> plus it's fun to see all the gears turn and then suddenly, RELEASE
[09:24:57] <timmywil> You hit enter a lot.
[09:25:08] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:25:39] <DaveMethvin> just looking up my test command
[09:25:55] <m_gol> <test release in progress>
[09:26:25] <DaveMethvin> node release.js --remote=dmethvin/jquery --branch=test --pre-release=2.1.1-beta1
[09:27:27] <DaveMethvin> i think other than the IE7 fix, the next step would be to get some feedback on the beta (i hope)
[09:27:51] <DaveMethvin> btw i'll be traveling a lot over the next two weeks, not sure if i'll make the next two meetings but I'll try
[09:27:58] <m_gol> I get an error
[09:28:14] <DaveMethvin> what's the error?
[09:28:18] <m_gol> Loading project-specific release script...

[09:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Are both of your repos up to date?
[09:30:13] <m_gol> ah, crap, my master, right
[09:30:20] <DaveMethvin> been there done that
[09:30:35] <m_gol> I don't keep master in my fork in sync as I just track upstream there
[09:30:40] <m_gol> but that explains the error
[09:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> If you're referring to your copy of jquery-release, you shouldn't use that for an actual release.
[09:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> There's a reason the README tells you to clone every time.
[09:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/#creating-a-release
[09:32:30] <m_gol> I was referring to my fork of jquery repo
[09:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[09:33:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah i often let my fork get old and stale
[09:33:35] <DaveMethvin> since i'm push pulls up to differerent branches anyway
[09:33:42] <DaveMethvin> really i don't use master there
[09:33:43] <m_gol> all my branches are tracked on mzgol/jquery but master & 1.x-master just track jquery/jquery
[09:33:47] <m_gol> which means they get old
[09:34:08] <m_gol> I wouldn't even probably have master if a default branch wasn't needed for the repo
[09:34:43] <m_gol> m_gol is not an owner of jquery on npm.
[09:34:43] <m_gol> Aborting.
[09:34:54] <m_gol> I thought it's not supposed to check npm for test runs?
[09:35:08] <m_gol> (last time I was publishing to npm I did it from the jquery account)
[09:35:18] <DaveMethvin> was it --pre-release?
[09:35:31] <m_gol> yep
[09:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> pre-release and test release are different.
[09:35:40] <m_gol> node release.js --remote=mzgol/jquery --branch=test --pre-release=2.1.1-beta1
[09:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> npm owner is always checked, even for a test release.
[09:36:11] <m_gol> ok
[09:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to disable that check, you can just make https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/blob/master/lib/npm.js#L27 return right away.
[09:37:26] <DaveMethvin> so that's pretty close to the end anyway, right?
[09:37:30] <m_gol> I added myself
[09:37:38] <DaveMethvin> ok :)
[09:38:17] <DaveMethvin> anybody else have anything they wanted to add to the agenda?
[09:38:31] <DaveMethvin> we still have a few open tickets for the .1 releases, assigned to various people
[09:38:42] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=%21closed&status=%21pending&group=milestone&report=3&order=priority
[09:39:03] <gibson042> m_gol I just pushed a fix for the effects failures
[09:39:39] <m_gol> gibson042: ok, maybe I'll trigger the weekly build to confirm
[09:39:46] <DaveMethvin> talk about last minute fix! :)
[09:39:56] <DaveMethvin> thanks gibson042
[09:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: The npm check is one of the first things.
[09:40:16] <DaveMethvin> oh you moved them all up front
[09:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we do as many checks as we can up front now.
[09:40:35] <DaveMethvin> which is good
[09:42:50] <m_gol> what's the point of __release/codeorigin.jquery.com/cdn/qunit?
[09:43:57] <DaveMethvin> good question ... we don't do unit tests on cdn
[09:44:09] <DaveMethvin> oh but that's qunit distribution?
[09:44:12] <timmywil> if it's the fake-cdn, it was a test release that hasn't been removed yet
[09:44:34] <m_gol> yep, fake-cdn
[09:44:36] <m_gol> https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/commits/2.1.1-beta1
[09:45:00] <timmywil> yea, you can blow that away
[09:45:11] <timmywil> but, you know, not on the real repo
[09:45:27] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:45:45] <DaveMethvin> never feel bad about stating the obvious timmywil
[09:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: You can just reset and force push on the fake-cdn.
[09:46:47] <timmywil> I go eat
[09:47:28] <DaveMethvin> ok i think we're done except for the release
[09:47:34] <DaveMethvin> didn't sound like anyone else had issues
[09:47:47] <DaveMethvin> i would like to get those last few .1 things done soon tho
[09:48:10] <DaveMethvin> or move them to the next milestone :)
[09:48:20] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: what's the reason for the fresh clone requirement? doesn't it just dump files to __release?
[09:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: To ensure that you're using the correct files.
[09:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> You can easily forget to check the state of an existing repo.
[09:49:00] <DaveMethvin> also so you won't accidentally forget to npm install i suspect
[09:49:13] <scott_gonzalez> There's no npm install. All deps are committed.
[09:49:54] <m_gol> ok, what else?
[09:50:34] <DaveMethvin> did the script finish?
[09:50:38] <m_gol> yup
[09:50:45] <m_gol> I posted a link to the created tag
[09:50:51] <m_gol> https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/commits/2.1.1-beta1
[09:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> The changelog is likely busted.
[09:51:08] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll need the list of tickets and contributors for the changelog
[09:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> Because it doens't handle our new commit message format yet.
[09:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on that right now.
[09:51:25] <DaveMethvin> i can pull some of it manulaly but whatever it got is a start
[09:51:57] <markelog> DaveMethvin: where are we stand on the promises concerns?
[09:52:09] <m_gol> should I repeat the process with real jquery/jquery repo and the master branch?
[09:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> I can also run my incomplete script locally after the real release so that you have a better starting point.
[09:52:21] <DaveMethvin> yehuda was supposed to be taking them to the stds orgs
[09:53:05] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: yep, take a deep breath and do the real thing
[09:53:10] <m_gol> :)
[09:53:42] <markelog> DaveMethvin: are we gonna create a special build with compliant promises of the ecmascript 6?
[09:54:23] <DaveMethvin> markelog: i updated the ticket desription to make it a bit clearer about what 2.2 would do: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14510
[09:54:26] <markelog> DaveMethvin: at the conference i will have a talk about promises, so it would be cool to known how we dealing with it
[09:54:58] <DaveMethvin> Deferred is so different from Promises that we can't just use them as a drop-in replacement
[09:55:31] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: node release.js --remote=jquery/jquery --pre-release=2.1.1-beta1?
[09:55:34] <DaveMethvin> i would like $.xhr to not have a dependency on Deferred or Callbacks and potentially use Promises
[09:55:50] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: looks right to me
[09:56:00] <gibson042> is "(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻" not a good way to deal with it?
[09:56:09] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:56:15] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: note that currently core/ready requires Deferreds
[09:56:28] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: yes but just a TINY bit
[09:56:50] <m_gol> that could be made to use ES6 Promises if $.ajax is excluded from a custom build
[09:57:01] <DaveMethvin> the only other big client is animate
[09:58:16] <DaveMethvin> as long as we can consume Promise for example in $.when i think that would be a good start
[09:58:39] <markelog> but other promises lib could not do the same with ours, right?
[09:58:53] <DaveMethvin> they generally can if they handle thenables i think
[09:59:03] <DaveMethvin> and there is Promise.cast() or whatever they're calling it now
[09:59:23] <m_gol> Promise.resolve AFAIK
[09:59:25] <markelog> i meant this old shuffle about catching errors
[09:59:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:59:40] <m_gol> ok, taking a deep breath & releasing ;)
[10:00:17] <DaveMethvin> markelog: i am not sure if Promise.resolve can catch errors that Deferred might throw
[10:01:01] <DaveMethvin> Chrome is supposed to have a compliant impl now, so it might be possible to test
[10:01:22] <DaveMethvin> in practice i think people are going to be really bitten by swallowed errors
[10:01:46] <markelog> so we are actually saying that our implimentation should be different?
[10:01:57] <markelog> except catching errors stuff
[10:02:07] <markelog> but we're proposing to fix that
[10:02:13] <markelog> correct?
[10:02:26] <DaveMethvin> $.Deferred is different in a lot of ways that we can't fix without breaking code that's out there now
[10:02:35] <markelog> right
[10:02:38] <DaveMethvin> multiple args, not swallowing errors, etc
[10:03:04] <markelog> but if we would do it from the scratch?
[10:03:22] <markelog> we would do it like ecmascript people suggest?
[10:03:54] <DaveMethvin> if i had a time machine i don't think we would implement Deferred in our library
[10:04:00] <markelog> )))
[10:04:13] <DaveMethvin> just use callbacks and people could have wrapped it with their own Promise lib
[10:04:34] <markelog> can i quote you on that? )
[10:04:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:05:00] <DaveMethvin> but it's not that Deferred is wrong, it's just that people decided on something differnet
[10:05:16] <DaveMethvin> it's like Microsoft saying that width included padding and border
[10:05:19] <DaveMethvin> which was SANE
[10:05:29] <DaveMethvin> and the standards going the other way
[10:05:32] <DaveMethvin> which was CRAZY
[10:05:51] <DaveMethvin> and then they try putting it back with a new CSS property
[10:06:10] <m_gol> PUBLISHED
[10:06:14] <markelog> Microsoft had i lot of great ideas, like xhr, CSS filters etc
[10:06:24] <DaveMethvin> woo hoo! http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1-beta1.js
[10:06:33] <markelog> m_gol: congrats!
[10:07:28] <DaveMethvin> so i forget where it puts the changelog stuff m_gol  but grab that and email it to me or throw it in a gist so i can build the blog
[10:07:40] <DaveMethvin> and then get started on 1.11.1-beta1
[10:07:41] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:07:53] <markelog> afk
[10:07:57] <DaveMethvin> k
[10:08:21] <DaveMethvin> let's call the meeting over but might as well finish the release here
[10:08:36] <m_gol> hmm, can't find the changelog
[10:08:51] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: where do the changelog files go?
[10:08:55] <m_gol> does it generate changelogs for beta releases at all?
[10:09:00] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[10:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't generate them for pre-releases yet.
[10:09:18] <DaveMethvin> scott said he'd do them manually off the branch
[10:09:22] <m_gol> k
[10:09:26] <m_gol> so I just start with 1.x
[10:09:35] <m_gol> first my repo, right?
[10:09:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah just to be safe
[10:11:13] <DaveMethvin> just gonna run for a couple of minutes
[10:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Be aware that you're going to need to change npm tags after publishing 1.x.
[10:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to get someone from core to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/48
[10:12:28] <m_gol> ok, can it be made (in the future) so that 1.x skippes tags?
[10:12:36] <m_gol> k
[10:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> I meant to ping everyone, but I accidentally used @jquery/jquery instead of @jquery/core, so it didn't do the notifications.
[10:13:23] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: editing should result in a ping
[10:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:16:58] <DaveMethvin> back
[10:17:54] <m_gol> test: https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/commit/b36b9459493d6f04000c1150236c01aa710a005d
[10:18:25] <m_gol> I guess the test run generates "//# sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map", contrary to the real one
[10:19:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: seems fine? I'll do the real release next
[10:19:37] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:25:40] <m_gol> done
[10:25:48] <m_gol> now I need to update the npm beta tag
[10:27:04] <m_gol> done as well
[10:27:08] <m_gol> :)
[10:27:19] <m_gol> it was pretty smooth, this release script is pretty cool
[10:28:52] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I guess you can close the channel now?
[10:29:09] <DaveMethvin> sure, thanks m_gol !
