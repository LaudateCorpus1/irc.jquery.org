[09:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[09:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no, no b-ot
[09:00:21] <jzaefferer> slacker bot
[09:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz arthurvr awayrxaviers mikesherov
[09:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Are you here?
[09:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> Guess not.
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> And no fnagel or rxaviers either.
[09:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> So then there's not much to discuss today.
[09:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker PR is pretty much ready to be merged.
[09:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> Button is getting close.
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> CJS/Webpack support landed.
[09:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer has been working on docs and miscellaneous updates.
[09:06:02] <arschmitz> hi sorry
[09:06:04] <arschmitz>  been having irc issues
[09:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yay, arschmitz is here.
[09:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> So let's talk about button.
[09:07:23] <arschmitz> ok i just pushed some updates based on last review
[09:07:29] <arschmitz> and some commits jzaefferer did
[09:08:22] <jzaefferer> did that address everything or is there more?
[09:09:14] <arschmitz> i need to rebase and fix one demo
[09:09:24] <arschmitz> i just noticed i missed
[09:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> Think this will be ready to merge into master before the summit?
[09:09:42] <arschmitz> yes
[09:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Think we can wrap up everything else to get a beta out in time for the summit?
[09:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> I still have some test failures to go through.
[09:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1354 still doesn't look so great
[09:11:07] <arschmitz> im pretty sure download builder does not properly support 1.12 based on last time i talked to rafael
[09:11:12] <jzaefferer> well, should also rebase on top of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1609
[09:11:43] <arschmitz> i think it has issues with multiple css structure files and no way to exclude a file from the Ui though maybe those got addressed
[09:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> You mean rebase button once the tests lands in master?
[09:11:54] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yes
[09:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:16:55] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: did you fix the button unit tests in IE8?
[09:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> Let's try to remember to ask Rafael about DB supporting 1.12.
[09:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll try to get a beta out in the next two weeks.
[09:17:39] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:18:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: no ill check on those
[09:18:57] <arschmitz> and the things you just commented
[09:20:16] <jzaefferer> Meanwhile I've started resurrecting https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1524 - plenty of breaking changes in master since, so I'm mostly starting over
[09:20:52] <jzaefferer> at least its enough to add pep as a dependency to mouse.js, can skip changing all the demos
[09:22:59] <jzaefferer> can I land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1608 ?
[09:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss?
[09:27:18] <jzaefferer> I figured out how to increase the expiration date for the pbworks wiki cookie!
[09:27:29] <jzaefferer> No more expiration after 2 hours \o/
[09:27:40] <jzaefferer> so, no, nothing else to discuss
[09:27:53] <jzaefferer> need reviews for all the docs PRs...
[09:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> How'd you do that?
