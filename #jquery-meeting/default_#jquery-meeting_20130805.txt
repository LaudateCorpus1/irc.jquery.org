[09:02:02] <DaveMethvin> orkel timmywil rwaldron jaubourg gnarf mikesherov gibson042 m_gol  Meeting time!
[09:02:32] <orkel> hey-hey
[09:02:39] <gibson042> oy
[09:03:03] <DaveMethvin> cmon turnout, where's everybody?
[09:03:14] <DaveMethvin> lazy days of summer i guess
[09:03:42] <DaveMethvin> oh well, at least we don't have any big problems on our hands
[09:03:58] <DaveMethvin> did you guys get a chance to look at the AMD branch?
[09:04:28] <orkel> i downloaded it but did not have to chance to check it out :-(
[09:04:41] <orkel> but it looks like we could move on with support module rewrite
[09:04:49] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:04:59] <gibson042> I haven't looked at it yet, but I think that makes sense too
[09:05:05] <DaveMethvin> i wondered about the general approach with the module references
[09:05:09] <DaveMethvin> i have a link in there
[09:05:09] <timmywil> hey there
[09:05:12] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:05:22] <DaveMethvin> perfect timing since we're talking amd
[09:05:36] <orkel> who is doing that btw? mikesherov, paul_irish, m_gol?
[09:06:06] <DaveMethvin> lazy init? timmywil did you sign up for that as part of AMD?
[09:06:21] <timmywil> I think I did, but if anyone wants to pick it up that's fine
[09:06:33] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it will be too hard
[09:06:46] <DaveMethvin> so i had a q about the way we use the module dependencies
[09:06:48] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/compare/AMD#L29R4
[09:07:14] <timmywil> sure, what's the questio
[09:07:16] <timmywil> n
[09:07:22] <DaveMethvin> Although this module depends on callbacks it uses jQuery.Callback rather than the parameter
[09:07:45] <DaveMethvin> didn't know if we should be following a rule about that
[09:07:49] <DaveMethvin> i guess if it's public vs private?
[09:08:08] <DaveMethvin> so rnotwhite is not public for example, it has to use the param
[09:08:29] <timmywil> right, I was thinking ahead to the built file
[09:08:42] <timmywil> all of the AMD definitions will get removed
[09:08:48] <DaveMethvin> well plus it keeps the diff cleaner :)
[09:09:02] <timmywil> however, we could do something like var Callbacks = jQuery.Callbacks so references wouldn't die
[09:09:18] <timmywil> but for now, I was trying to keep the build as simple as possible
[09:09:25] <DaveMethvin> i think that's fine
[09:09:49] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil what is left to do and how much work is it?
[09:10:23] <timmywil> updating the build to trace dependencies, convert "var" modules to var declarations, concatenate, and remove AMD wrappers
[09:10:36] <timmywil> it's not too complicated. I just haven't had time.
[09:10:56] <timmywil> I should be able to make progress this week though
[09:11:04] <DaveMethvin> ok, great!
[09:11:35] <DaveMethvin> back to testswarm for a sec
[09:12:00] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle got Browserstack to update their browsers and fix an IE9 issue
[09:12:03] <DaveMethvin> so that's good
[09:12:13] <orkel> cool
[09:12:27] <DaveMethvin> he also found that horrid version comparison, made a ticket for it
[09:12:37] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at what the best fix would be for that
[09:12:52] <DaveMethvin> it's a pretty obscure backcompat issue in the first place
[09:13:09] <DaveMethvin> we've collected up enough things that it may be time for another Migrate release soon
[09:14:09] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 could you take a look at what needs to be done there?
[09:14:37] <gibson042> I may not be able to until next week
[09:14:52] <DaveMethvin> that should be fine, nothing urgent
[09:14:58] <gibson042> no problem then
[09:15:19] <DaveMethvin> FYI I've been working on the 2014 budget for the jQuery Foundation
[09:15:39] <DaveMethvin> we're aiming to get everyone together for San Diego in Feb and Chicago in August
[09:15:49] <DaveMethvin> so pencil in your calendars
[09:16:17] <DaveMethvin> alright ... performance
[09:16:23] <orkel> wait a sec
[09:16:27] <DaveMethvin> k
[09:16:30] <orkel> about the testswarm stuff
[09:16:50] <orkel> we have a couple of failures in our master branch
[09:17:05] <orkel> apparently we did not notice them before
[09:17:28] <DaveMethvin> there was one that i thought was due to the browsers needing updates
[09:17:38] <orkel> this commit makes almost every browser to fail https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ec6eb38
[09:18:02] <orkel> it's about order of the flex stuff
[09:18:12] <DaveMethvin> that one, yeah, that's b/c the "order" property isn't supported on a lot of browsers
[09:18:15] <orkel> IE10 < (in IE10 there is special prefix for "order"), Safari and Firefox < 22 don't support it, there is gonna be a lot of code to to do it properly, i propose to revert it entirely or move the assertion in separate test which will be executed only if browser support it and test it only then.
[09:18:18] <timmywil> sounds like orkel can fix it ;)
[09:18:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah, can you fix it orkel :)
[09:18:54] <orkel> we have to choises either to remove it or make test to run only in supported browsers
[09:18:59] <DaveMethvin> i think m_gol had it on his plate
[09:19:10] <DaveMethvin> i would be fine with removing it tbh
[09:19:30] <orkel> i will make PR and cc m_gol
[09:19:44] <orkel> now another failure
[09:19:56] <orkel> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/629002
[09:20:07] <orkel> I have a fix for it, it is similar to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/16115c1d9117cd0c22504d7b52f0f91e18c0d8df
[09:20:07] <b-ot> orkel: Oleg (2mon 2d ago): support.boxSizingReliable in FF 23 should be true. Close gh-1288
[09:20:25] <DaveMethvin> right, that was the one i was thinking of
[09:20:44] <DaveMethvin> so we can just land that
[09:21:11] <orkel> If we can fix those two it should make tests to pass in master branch
[09:21:27] <orkel> Why tests for 1.x-master failling across the board is a mystery, because if you run them directly through jenkins from browserstack or from VM they all pass in oldIE.
[09:22:12] <DaveMethvin> did they ever run since we've changed servers? i wonder if something unusual is going on there
[09:22:24] <orkel> We might have talk with QUnit team about that?
[09:23:19] <DaveMethvin> good idea
[09:23:35] <orkel> Also from now on, i propose to revert or provide immediate fix for any commit to jQuery Core which made our tests to fail
[09:23:58] <DaveMethvin> i think that would be good, once we get to things working again
[09:24:11] <orkel> okay
[09:24:11] <DaveMethvin> i am still not trusting our test infrastructure, which is not good
[09:24:25] <DaveMethvin> we should have confidence that when there is a failure it's really a failure
[09:24:37] <orkel> yeah, that's pretty annoying
[09:24:42] <DaveMethvin> some of the effects and ajax tests may need work to run successfully
[09:25:12] <DaveMethvin> and actually i'd rather skip those specific tests in Jenkins/swarm if we can't get them to run reliably
[09:25:27] <DaveMethvin> because they make it really hard to tell if we are introducing regressions for everything else
[09:26:19] <DaveMethvin> alright, performance!
[09:26:30] <orkel> sounds like a bad tendency, i will check it out
[09:26:35] <DaveMethvin> i like the idea of a single dashboard
[09:26:40] <DaveMethvin> but it may be ambitious
[09:27:05] <DaveMethvin> can we just do the perf as some sort of independent automated run backed by Browserstack perhaps
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> then figure out how to integrate
[09:27:35] <orkel> yeah, i'm working on it right now
[09:27:40] <DaveMethvin> great
[09:27:50] <orkel> the problem is where we could show that data
[09:27:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:28:30] <DaveMethvin> maybe Krinkle would have some ideas for that too, seems very similar to our unit test process
[09:28:43] <DaveMethvin> need to store results in a database and then retrieve, compare, etc
[09:28:59] <orkel> that task would use saucelabs not browserstack, but anyway if you run it locally it would take a lot of time and space
[09:29:57] <orkel> so we have to use in our continuous integration process
[09:30:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:30:34] <orkel> showing data is pretty easy that should just a simple graph power by highcharts for example
[09:30:52] <DaveMethvin> what we care about would require some history tho
[09:30:59] <DaveMethvin> like, to find perf regressions
[09:31:18] <DaveMethvin> we would want to know how fast/slow it was compared to say 1.10.2
[09:31:37] <orkel> yeah, but it also not a tricky thing to do, just store the data in one table and show it if request is made
[09:32:00] <DaveMethvin> and then have a bot yell at us in #jquery-dev :)
[09:32:17] <orkel> mmm, did not think about that, but yeah that should be very helpful
[09:32:21] <timmywil> bot says, "what the fuck, dude"
[09:32:25] <DaveMethvin> we shall name it slobot
[09:32:33] <orkel> :-)
[09:33:10] <DaveMethvin> alright, anything else on that? If not i had a couple of questions on ticket triage?
[09:33:17] <orkel> but we need a Krinkle approval, maybe he would not like the idea
[09:33:40] <DaveMethvin> he may have an even better idea
[09:33:49] <DaveMethvin> can you talk with him orkel?
[09:33:56] <orkel> sure thing!
[09:34:04] <DaveMethvin> ok, on this ticket http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14191
[09:34:19] <orkel> i think we have to reject it
[09:34:25] <orkel> owner of the ticket propose to remove execScript statement and always use eval, which is obviously would not work in oldIE.
[09:34:39] <orkel> also he proposes to add "context" argument which by his own admission would not work in IE.
[09:34:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah it seems like it wouldnt work for oldIE
[09:34:45] <orkel> globalEval in master branch also deals with "use strict" stuff, which would not work in that code path.
[09:35:15] <DaveMethvin> using globalEval is a bad idea anyway :)
[09:35:46] <orkel> yep, but sometimes it is only way to do the task :-(
[09:36:13] <DaveMethvin> all the others look like junk, i am not sure about this one: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14157
[09:37:02] <DaveMethvin> i just don't know enough about those cases
[09:38:53] <orkel> btw, on globalEval, do we really need a "use strict" check?
[09:39:10] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it's essential
[09:39:25] <DaveMethvin> globalEval is supposed to be global scope right?
[09:39:34] <DaveMethvin> so what is "use strict" doing in global scope?
[09:39:35] <orkel> yeah!
[09:39:50] <DaveMethvin> that's my excuse and i am sticking to it :)
[09:39:55] <orkel> :-)
[09:39:57] <orkel> ))
[09:40:12] <orkel> also we have it on branch but not in other one, it's reflecting on execution of big javascript code and it's a bit tricky to parse.
[09:40:47] <DaveMethvin> I am not sure how it got in there, maybe a ticket was related
[09:41:02] <DaveMethvin> but if so you would expect to see it in both branchs
[09:41:26] <orkel> i think it was happen at time we rewrite the core module for 2.0
[09:41:32] <orkel> shold a make a PR and include rwldrn?
[09:42:00] <DaveMethvin> sounds good, we can discuss it there orkel
[09:42:05] <orkel> okay
[09:42:12] <orkel> one other thing from me
[09:42:18] <orkel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1321
[09:42:18] <b-ot> orkel: Pull request #1321 by terrycojones (3d 16h ago): Removed an unneeded variable in deferred.js
[09:42:26] <orkel> i think we could merge it
[09:42:41] <orkel> it's -5 to master and -7 to 1.x-master
[09:42:53] <DaveMethvin> i agree, the PRs need to be cleaned up anyway there are several that could be landed
[09:43:06] <DaveMethvin> do you want to land that one?
[09:43:26] <orkel> yeah :-)
[09:43:33] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[09:43:37] <orkel> cool
[09:44:25] <DaveMethvin> alright i think that does it
[09:44:34] <DaveMethvin> anything from anyone else?
[09:44:52] <DaveMethvin> alright, see you in -dev!
