[10:04:30] <sfrisk> Meeting time guys!
[10:05:43] <sfrisk> @jobebot0101 @arschmitz @scott_gonzalez
[10:06:01] <sfrisk> err @joebot01_
[10:06:12] <sfrisk> who else am I missing?
[10:06:18] <joebot01_> afternoon all
[10:06:24] <arschmitz> kborchers: ianmaffett
[10:06:30] <ianmaffett> Hello!
[10:06:33] <sfrisk> Meeting Agenda: https://docs.google.com/a/sarahfrisk.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit#gid=1618433393
[10:06:51] <arschmitz> markelog__:
[10:07:39] <sfrisk> So do you guys want to know the result of the name voting at the beginning of this meeting, or the end?
[10:07:58] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: too oops
[10:08:14] <arschmitz> YES!
[10:08:59] <sfrisk> So a grand total of 10 anonymous people voted on the name of the css framework
[10:09:36] <sfrisk> With the results being 60% for Chassis, and 40% for Draft
[10:09:45] <sfrisk> Soooo, really close
[10:09:57] <arschmitz> yup but chassis it is sounds like
[10:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> YAY
[10:10:28] <arschmitz> so we have a name! woo
[10:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> So, I guess a follow up question is what do we want the repo name to be? chassis, chassis-css, css-chassis?
[10:11:15] <arschmitz> like like css-chassis
[10:11:29] <joebot01_> i like both chassis and css-chassis
[10:11:33] <sfrisk> Chassis is nice from a simplicity standpoint, although css chassis does help explain what it is
[10:11:56] <arschmitz> likely better for search-ability too
[10:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> There are also 0 repos with the name css-chassis on GitHub.
[10:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few with the name chassis.
[10:12:25] <arschmitz> done!
[10:12:29] <joebot01_> boom
[10:12:30] <arschmitz> lol
[10:12:33] <sfrisk> decision made!
[10:12:39] <joebot01_> productivity!
[10:12:46] <sfrisk> w000t
[10:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll rename it right now :-)
[10:13:00] <sfrisk> awesome, thanks scott_gonzalez
[10:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> DONE!
[10:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis
[10:13:20] <arschmitz> WOO HOO!
[10:13:31] <sfrisk> exciting!
[10:13:44] <sfrisk> I can update the readme later, unless someone else wants to?
[10:13:59] <sfrisk> since it's currently referring to the project as CSS Framework
[10:14:15] <arschmitz> yeah we should try to purge any refrences to css-framework
[10:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> There's probably a few places we need to update.
[10:14:28] <arschmitz> ill update my pr for the package.json and stuff too
[10:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to have someone go through and find them all and make updates today.
[10:14:43] <sfrisk> I'll create an issue for it
[10:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> Could probably just tack it on to the existing naming issue.
[10:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> And we can use the commit that updates everything as the trigger that closes that issue.
[10:15:42] <sfrisk> ohh, yeah, that might make sense
[10:15:45] <sfrisk> I'll add a note then
[10:17:11] <sfrisk> so if someone wants to tackle https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/14 that will be awesome, if not, I can do it tonight
[10:17:51] <arschmitz> i can do it
[10:18:04] <arschmitz> there are only 2 occurences
[10:18:10] <arschmitz> and i have to change more then that in my pr
[10:18:15] <arschmitz> so might as well do it at the same time
[10:18:23] <sfrisk> okay, that works
[10:19:54] <sfrisk> Okay so next up on the agenda is https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/1
[10:20:42] <sfrisk> bringing this discussion into the meeting mostly because there seems to be a lot of discussion at this very moment about how we're going to do icons
[10:21:37] <sfrisk> (Ignoring the specific icon set at the moment, since the discussion has moved more to UNICODE vs SVG type icons
[10:21:39] <sfrisk> )
[10:22:57] <arschmitz> I like the idea of using unicode glyphs but i have some concenrs
[10:23:02] <sfrisk> Is jslegers here at all?
[10:23:21] <sfrisk> I know he was a big proponent of using unicode
[10:23:25] <arschmitz> i dont think so dont see a similar name
[10:24:49] <sfrisk> Okay then, what were your concerns arschmitz?
[10:25:22] <arschmitz> well one thing for sure is i much prefer each icon to be its own span
[10:25:41] <arschmitz> not in the text node for a variety of technical reasons i mention in the issue comments
[10:26:09] <arschmitz> mostly to do with selection via javascript
[10:27:12] <arschmitz> beyond that there is if we care about the ability to use multiple colors gradients animations
[10:27:33] <arschmitz> and if we use the content css prop there are rendering bugs
[10:28:06] <sfrisk> (these animated svg icons are cool: http://livicons.com/)
[10:28:28] <arschmitz> yup
[10:28:46] <sfrisk> Does anyone else have any opinions on the matter? to argue for or against unicode icons?
[10:28:56] <arschmitz> im also not sure how we feel abour forcing people to copy and paste raw unicode if not in the content attribute
[10:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> Our users will for sure not insert the characters themselves.
[10:29:52] <arschmitz> which rules out every possibility jslegers mentions execpt the one with rendering bugs
[10:29:59] <sfrisk> I know when I've done unicode stuff with font awesome, I use a cheat sheet
[10:30:13] <sfrisk> but that's mostly when I'm doing something on a photoshop file
[10:30:27] <sfrisk> and adding icons to a design
[10:31:00] <arschmitz> so does anyone think we should require devs to enter the unicode characters themselves?
[10:31:36] <joebot01_> i get the hesitation around ease of use, but to me having a robust icon set is good enough reason for me to read the docs on how to implement and follow suit
[10:31:37] <sfrisk> my argument against that - is if you're dealing with (for whatever reason) a non dev needs to be using the icons
[10:31:45] <arschmitz> because if we all agree this should be done via class then this eliminates many of the issues
[10:32:05] <joebot01_> but easier is also better, often :)
[10:32:30] <arschmitz> joebot01_: i dont think this affects the robustness of the icon set
[10:32:35] <arschmitz> just how its implemented
[10:33:48] <joebot01_> i didn't mean to say one way limits the scope of the icon set...just that a particularly robust icon set will offset any minor implementation pain
[10:33:49] <joebot01_> for me
[10:33:59] <arschmitz> ok gotcha
[10:34:13] <joebot01_> but you guys have broader support experience with a wider range of devs, so i know that influences you
[10:34:26] <arschmitz> in general robustness would favor svg since it allows multi color and animation
[10:34:36] <joebot01_> i tend to favor svg
[10:34:43] <sfrisk> also it would allow for custom icons
[10:34:51] <joebot01_> much easier to deal with *esp* for customizing
[10:35:01] <arschmitz> yup
[10:35:04] <joebot01_> which i almost always have to do, for that one outlyer
[10:35:26] <arschmitz> also our experience with support is that there are a lot of devices ( which we will support ) that have incomplete support
[10:35:42] <arschmitz> they do technically support but do not properly render
[10:36:01] <joebot01_> true (box box box)
[10:36:10] <arschmitz> so support tests say that font-icons work so they get applied
[10:36:16] <arschmitz> this is not the case with svg
[10:36:45] <arschmitz> and either case requires some JS to implement a proper fallback
[10:38:50] <arschmitz> joebot01_: its more then just that some times sizes are off our they get static
[10:38:55] <arschmitz> all sorts of weird ness
[10:41:05] <arschmitz> so it sounds like people are generally favoring svg is that the case?
[10:41:19] <joebot01_> my vote is for svg
[10:41:27] <arschmitz> +1
[10:41:36] <sfrisk> It sounds that way. I mean, I would love to have other input, but since the other opinion isn't here . .
[10:41:45] <sfrisk> I give my +1 to SVG
[10:42:07] <arschmitz> yeah i mean im not dead set on svg it just seems like the choice that makes the most sense
[10:43:49] <sfrisk> Okay I'm going to skip Code Style Guide real quick just to check to see if anyone has any news on performance testing?
[10:45:52] <arschmitz> kborchers: did you get any response on that?
[10:46:06] <sfrisk> last news I heard was that kborchers talked to kristoferjoseph and brianleroux and they said they were going to be working on it
[10:48:13] <arschmitz> so i guess thats a no
[10:48:21] <sfrisk> guess so
[10:48:34] <arschmitz> i pinged Kristofer about something else last week and never heard back either
[10:49:19] <sfrisk> Okay then, on the naming conventions note, anyone who has any concerns about BEM, please write them down in  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mQTvgCPxwRvF7z4BgSEYaGaEwbK_9_Q9Ig_MMKEl-Ho/edit?usp=sharing
[10:49:35] <sfrisk> we're going to be trying to have that call later this week
[10:51:08] <sfrisk> Also, arschmitz has a pull request.  I think he's going to add in the Chassis stuff while he does that?  Anyone else have anything to say about the PR?
[10:52:01] <arschmitz> bigger question anyone mind if i force push master to fix an author name and avoid a mailmap?
[10:52:29] <arschmitz> since there is basicly nothing there yet i dont see a big issue there are only 4 commits and we just changed the name anyway
[10:55:51] <sfrisk> anyone? any concerns?
[10:56:05] <joebot01_> none here
[10:57:04] <sfrisk> okay, might as well then, arschmitz
[10:59:28] <sfrisk> Okay then, we're almost at 2 o'clock, the one thing left on the list is code style guide
[10:59:59] <sfrisk> I know I need to sit down at some point and finish writing up the html style guide for future contributors
[11:00:11] <arschmitz> the name of this is confusing to me when i think of a style guide i think of like the stuff on contribute.jquery.org
[11:00:20] <arschmitz> this seems like its more of a visual test page
[11:00:41] <sfrisk> Welcome to the joys of style guides, there are 3 different versions of them :-D
[11:00:44] <arschmitz> or am i confused even more then i thought?
[11:00:53] <sfrisk> the stuff we have on contribute, which is the code style guides
[11:01:24] <sfrisk> then stuff like the jquery brand guide, which is more of a graphic design style guide: http://brand.jquery.org/colors/#jquery-black
[11:02:02] <sfrisk> then you have the user interaction style guide, similar to http://getbootstrap.com/css/ (minus the code bits) that lets you quickly look over everything and make sure it looks right
[11:02:16] <arschmitz> ok gotcha im confusing this with the other issue https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/11 sorry
[11:02:42] <arschmitz> code style guide is exactly what i thought its number #11 that i found confusing
[11:03:06] <sfrisk> nope #11 is the code+visual I guess? together?
[11:03:21] <arschmitz> 11 i would think is just visual
[11:03:32] <arschmitz> and would be the third one you listed
[11:03:42] <sfrisk> well I meant, you need code for that particular style guide to work, but it's user interaction in general
[11:04:01] <arschmitz> ok
[11:04:32] <sfrisk> 1.) Just Design 2.) Just talking about how to code 3.) A page using the standards laid out in 1 + 2
[11:04:35] <sfrisk> if that makes sense?
[11:04:42] <arschmitz> yes
[11:04:56] <sfrisk> Anyway, we can go more in depth next meeting
[11:05:20] <arschmitz> yeah we really just need to add scss rules i think
[11:05:27] <sfrisk> Definitely
[11:05:51] <arschmitz> and fill out the html one like you said
[11:06:02] <sfrisk> yup
[11:06:03] <sfrisk> Okay, i'm going to call the meeting over, and I'll see all of you same time, same place, next week!
