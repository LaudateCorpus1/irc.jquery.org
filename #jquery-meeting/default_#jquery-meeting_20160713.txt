[12:01:39] <fnagel> hi
[12:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> So, we finally tagged 1.12.0, but ran into a bunch of problems.
[12:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> As a result, we haven't announced yet.
[12:03:54] <fnagel> what happend?
[12:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> The deployment for jqueryui.com was broken (some issues with the infrastructure transition from puppet to ansible, I believe).
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> I was able to fix that manually on the server.
[12:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> download builder keeps breaking, but we're not sure how that's happening.
[12:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> We released with a pretty bad bug in checkboxradio from a fix during the RC :-/
[12:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll need to get 1.12.1 out pretty quickly after we fix all these issues.
[12:08:28] <fnagel> damn
[12:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer arschmitz: Are you here?
[12:08:53] <arschmitz> hi
[12:09:01] <arschmitz> sorry lost track of time
[12:09:09] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Have you had a chance to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1719?
[12:09:26] <jzaefferer> I guess we won't accounce 1.12.0 at all? Once we've got the infra issues resolved, hopefully 1.12.1 is ready...
[12:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, we can do 1.12.1 right away and then announce that.
[12:10:06] <arschmitz> just did looks good
[12:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've got that merged now.
[12:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> Besides download builder issues, if people have time to look into test failures, we've still got scattered failures: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryui
[12:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> I fixed a bunch of failures already, but we've still got a fair amount to work through.
[12:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> We'll continue releasing with failures, but I'd like to get back to green ASAP.
[12:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer also pointed out that we need to capture npm usage changes in the upgrade guide: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/150
[12:20:03] <arschmitz> yeah i saw issue about that
[12:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I don't have much else to discuss besides the release problems.
[12:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> Getting those resolved are the highest priority.
[12:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else we need to discuss today?
[12:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, that's all for today.
[12:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
