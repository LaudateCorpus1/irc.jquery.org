[14:04:22] <sfrisk> Meeting Time!
[14:04:34] <kristyjy> hello
[14:04:38] <sfrisk> @kristyjy, arschmitz, arthurvr, geekman-rohit
[14:07:03] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[14:08:35] <sfrisk> Okay, so I have a basic list of the issues needed for phase one release that are code specific (with the exception of the JSASS style guide, since we sorta need to finalize that discussion
[14:08:36] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3j69bjpc-IH5roXhIYhSOGfL4SE10pZvMvKuetpJ_s/edit?usp=sharing
[14:10:30] <sfrisk> trying to see if I can get ahold of rohit regarding today's meeting
[14:11:48] <sfrisk> Since our goal was to sorta lock down and finalize some things regarding JSASS
[14:12:10] <sfrisk> specifically maps vs variables and usage
[14:12:48] <kristyjy> yeah probably good to talk about that sooner rather than later
[14:13:06] <sfrisk> well since moving forward on some items is rather dependent on that
[14:16:10] <sfrisk> overall a lot of research I did is pushing towards using maps + functions instead of variables
[14:16:37] <sfrisk> err maps *
[14:18:20] <sfrisk> As a side note, this is interesting for color palettes https://scotch.io/tutorials/aesthetic-sass-2-colors
[14:22:32] <kristyjy> that's cool
[14:23:52] <sfrisk> righto. well, I suppose I could just continue the buttons PR with the current map as is
[14:24:12] <sfrisk> tweak it as needed as I create mixins
[14:24:33] <sfrisk> and we can look at it next week to see if it makes sense in context vs just sitting by itself
[14:26:01] <kristyjy> that sounds like a good idea. Examples always makes things easier to understand :)
[14:27:55] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll make that the plan for next week
[14:28:28] <sfrisk> see ya next week
