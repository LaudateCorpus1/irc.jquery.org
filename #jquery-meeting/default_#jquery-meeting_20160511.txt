[12:06:39] <arschmitz> and yes im about to push all the fixes for controlgroup in a moment
[12:06:50] <arschmitz> for the bugs i filed plus the one gabrielschulhof filed
[12:07:07] <arschmitz> i didnt get to the dialog one because i ran into there others
[12:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[12:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's be good if jzaefferer or rxaviers could review that.
