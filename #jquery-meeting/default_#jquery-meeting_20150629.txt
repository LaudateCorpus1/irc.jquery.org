[09:00:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, markelog, m_gol, arthurvr meeting yo
[09:00:16] <b-ot> timmywil: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:00:21] <timmywil> `read
[09:00:21] <b-ot> timmywil: From m_gol, 1w 5d ago: let me know when you're available for a moment
[09:00:28] <timmywil> woops!
[09:00:29] <DaveMethvin> here
[09:00:45] <DaveMethvin> you're as bad as me timmywil
[09:00:46] <arthurvr> hi
[09:00:46] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:01:01] <timmywil> wait, 1w 5d? I typed before then.
[09:02:03] <m_gol> present
[09:02:07] <timmywil> how goes things
[09:02:26] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:02:28] <gibson042> I survived another year of camping, so pretty good :)
[09:02:38] <m_gol> compat is broken on IE8
[09:02:38] <gibson042> *week
[09:02:41] <m_gol> nothing serious, though
[09:02:45] <timmywil> ha, year
[09:02:54] <gibson042> you should see my beard!
[09:03:06] <gibson042> WHAT YEAR IS IT?
[09:03:22] <timmywil> You're making me stumble
[09:03:25] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:04:12] <m_gol> gibson042: jQuery Hipsta Team
[09:04:13] <timmywil> so yea, we do have some failures in IE8
[09:04:15] <m_gol> we used to have most effects tests failing but that was just one little bug; the remaining ones are only in tests for newly added modules by gnarf & only in IE8 so this is nothing serious, I don't think we need to block landing things because of that: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/820
[09:04:18] <timmywil> looks like the new effects tests
[09:04:32] <timmywil> m_gol: agreed
[09:04:44] <timmywil> but we need someone to tackel the failures
[09:04:49] <timmywil> perhaps gnarf
[09:04:53] <timmywil> tackle
[09:05:12] <m_gol> if he has time for it in the nearby future then that'd be best
[09:05:24] <gnarf> m_gol: timmywil: promise to look today/tonight
[09:05:31] <m_gol> gnarf: thx :)
[09:05:34] <timmywil> cool, thanks gnarf !
[09:05:40] <gnarf> I would have solved friday - but I couldn't find the one line m_gol found
[09:05:45] <m_gol> haha
[09:05:51] <gnarf> got stressed and had to run
[09:05:59] <timmywil> np
[09:06:15] <timmywil> I think there was something I wanted to bring up this week, but I can't remember what.
[09:06:29] <timmywil> There's some PRs I think we can land.
[09:06:33] <timmywil> Oh, show/hide
[09:06:44] <timmywil> so, where do we stand on that?
[09:06:49] <timmywil> we need to decide on something for the alpha
[09:07:04] <DaveMethvin> AAARRRGH
[09:07:15] <DaveMethvin> i am so torn on that one
[09:07:18] <gnarf> timmywil: issue?
[09:07:23] <gnarf> sorry out of loop
[09:07:24] <gibson042> I would like to leave in all changes, and respond to any uproar with post-iteration cleanup
[09:07:34] <DaveMethvin> all the solutions suck, including the status quo
[09:07:46] <timmywil> gnarf: there are a few. 2 open blockers related: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABlocker
[09:07:51] <timmywil> 2308 and 2057
[09:08:00] <gibson042> e.g., .show() can use gCS _after_ setting display: "" and override still-hidden elements then
[09:08:01] <DaveMethvin> but i would be interested to see how people react to what is currently there
[09:08:25] <timmywil> gibson042: is that what we have landed now?
[09:08:28] <gibson042> no
[09:08:48] <gibson042> right now, show just toggles inline display
[09:08:55] <timmywil> right right
[09:08:58] <gibson042> ignoring the cascade completely
[09:09:12] <timmywil> is that what the currently-open PR would accomplish?
[09:09:22] <gibson042> what's the PR?
[09:09:49] <timmywil> ok, nvm. The PR seems to be just a spec-driven defaultDisplay
[09:09:56] <markelog> what is "post-iteration cleanup"?
[09:10:04] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2374
[09:11:02] <gibson042> markelog: we set inline style in a loop... I'm saying that we could check the effects after that loop ends, and apply defaultDisplay then
[09:11:18] <timmywil> gibson042: so, are you proposing we leave what's there or are you proposing to implement your "e.g."
[09:11:25] <gibson042> so anyone Doing It Rightâ„¢ wouldn't suffer
[09:11:48] <gibson042> I'm proposing leaving what's there, with the e.g. as an option for responding to alpha/beta complaints
[09:11:55] <gibson042> I remain opposed to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2374
[09:12:09] <markelog> i'm for reverting
[09:12:10] <timmywil> I see
[09:12:19] <markelog> we will do it anyways
[09:12:26] <timmywil> markelog: we need to be specific tho. Do you want to revert everything?
[09:12:43] <markelog> just like it was said in the letter
[09:12:54] <markelog> will probably drop the performance fix in favor of features (hopefully, Chrome will improve when retrieving a computed display value)
[09:13:02] <markelog> from "Deav Leads Meeting Minutes"
[09:13:35] <timmywil> I see
[09:14:08] <markelog> we can do this dance with alpha, but seriously, when everything will broke and ppl would say nothing only in situation when they will stop using jq
[09:15:44] <markelog> still bad at expressing my thoughts )
[09:15:48] <timmywil> My thinking there was that I don't see a way to show cascade-hidden elements without retrieving computed display.
[09:16:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that's the basic catch-22
[09:17:01] <markelog> yeah
[09:17:02] <timmywil> also, maybe we've said this, but if we show cascade-hidden elements, will we also break responsive stylesheets?
[09:17:13] <gibson042> sometimes
[09:17:19] <DaveMethvin> the old code broke that, the current code does better actually
[09:17:37] <timmywil> gibson042: right, you're proposing we only stick a display on there if we have to
[09:17:44] <gibson042> right
[09:17:46] <timmywil> I like that better
[09:18:03] <gibson042> and _only_ if we're committed to keep .show()ing cascade-hidden elements
[09:18:18] <timmywil> gibson042: I think we have to
[09:18:26] <gibson042> based on what?
[09:18:34] <timmywil> gut
[09:18:36] <gibson042> I still want a pre-release that doesn't
[09:18:45] <timmywil> ok, I'm fine with that
[09:18:49] <arthurvr> :+1:
[09:19:12] <markelog> let's hear the people
[09:19:14] <gibson042> also, roll-your-own forceShow isn't bad: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2374#issuecomment-108933115
[09:19:24] <timmywil> so, all in favor of keeping what we have for alpha and adjusting later
[09:19:26] <timmywil> +1
[09:19:29] <gibson042> +1
[09:19:40] <DaveMethvin> markelog: yeah, if we have to go back it will because the people told us, which isn't so bad
[09:19:41] <m_gol> I'm +0
[09:19:49] <m_gol> maybe +0.2
[09:19:56] <DaveMethvin> NO FRACTIONS
[09:19:58] <timmywil> it helps with getting a release out
[09:20:02] <markelog> -1, do not see the point :-)
[09:20:05] <gibson042> +1-i
[09:20:14] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: sorry, +0.30000000000000004
[09:20:17] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:20:19] <timmywil> lol
[09:20:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin?
[09:20:23] <markelog> DaveMethvin: sure, better reason, then my opinion
[09:20:33] <markelog> ))
[09:20:53] <DaveMethvin> i'm good with what we have in there now for the alpha
[09:21:03] <DaveMethvin> let's get feedback
[09:21:28] <timmywil> ok, we'll do that for alpha, then. sry markelog! You got outvoted.
[09:21:43] <markelog> yeah, i knew that beforehand )
[09:22:10] <timmywil> that just leaves 3 fairly simple blockers
[09:22:37] <timmywil> which are currently assigned to me, gibson042, and m_gol
[09:23:00] <timmywil> m_gol, gibson042: do you think you can get to them before next week?
[09:23:10] <m_gol> timmywil: yes
[09:23:15] <gibson042> yes
[09:23:21] <m_gol> I should have it ready before Friday
[09:23:25] <timmywil> cool
[09:23:45] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'll prolly want to get with you to look over the blog post real quick
[09:23:54] <DaveMethvin> ok, sounds good
[09:24:07] <timmywil> nething else?
[09:24:30] <timmywil> thanks everybody! see you in -dev.
[09:24:54] <arthurvr> bye
