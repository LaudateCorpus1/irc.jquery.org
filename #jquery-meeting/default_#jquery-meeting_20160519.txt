[08:07:46] <agcolom> zz_AurelioDeRosa: Sorry for my previous message... Are you around at all?
[08:08:01] <agcolom> (I thought I would not be free at 1pm)
[08:08:19] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[08:12:52] <agcolom> hi :-)
[08:13:12] <connor__> Hey!
[08:13:17] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi Anne, hi Connor
[08:13:18] <agcolom> hey !
[08:13:29] <agcolom> Sorry I've been so busy!!!!
[08:13:51] <agcolom> So I haven't had a chance to prepare much!
[08:13:54] <AurelioDeRosa> No worries Anne, it happens
[08:13:56] <connor__> No problem :)
[08:14:56] <agcolom> I've checked the status of the GSOC issues
[08:15:02] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[08:15:23] <agcolom> connor__: please feel free to add/amend things there....
[08:15:43] <connor__> Will do, I think I fixed another tiny issue as well
[08:16:17] <connor__> Apologies though, I haven't had much activity on the issues this week - it's the last week of my placement so everything got a bit crazy handing work over
[08:16:44] <AurelioDeRosa> I totally understand the pressure Connor, it's fine
[08:17:11] <AurelioDeRosa> I also had a chance today to read your email in case Anne and you are  happy to discuss it
[08:18:29] <agcolom> sure.
[08:18:31] <connor__> Cheers :), yeah that would be good, I started making a Google doc with more detail and plan to create an Invision demo for the interface
[08:19:35] <agcolom> great. Can you share a link?
[08:20:17] <AurelioDeRosa> I think the plan is good but I'd like to know a bit more about the technical details. Basically, we need to Node.js (API-based? I'd like it) app that can talk  with the WP plugin. The latter will be mainly used to manage  the CRUD operations
[08:20:30] <connor__> Link here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mWBIpoN4ZU9vGRKP3vG_Zze0lsoWD6QiN3RNUQhps1g/edit?usp=sharing
[08:20:36] <agcolom> We could have google hangout for sound it that helps?
[08:20:51] <connor__> Can do
[08:21:21] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: how about adding Google hangout for sound to ease the discussion?
[08:21:45] <AurelioDeRosa> Cool

[12:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> bethge_
[12:00:15] <bethge_> hi
[12:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> Some of bethge_'s PRs were merged.
[12:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> mouse is always an active pointer (https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/282)
[12:01:22] <bethge_> \o/
[12:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> more W3C tests (https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/281)
[12:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> And one more is ready to be merged.
[12:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> assert that the capturing node is connected to the DOM (https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/283)
[12:01:56] <bethge_> On it
[12:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> The discussion about boundary events during pointer capture is still ongoing.
[12:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ted Dinklocker from Microsoft provided a desktop scenario that shows why they would want pointer capture on a button: https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/61#issuecomment-220192237
[12:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> So the question is does it really make sense to always do the hit testing to provide the developer with enter/leave events rather than requiring the developer to do the hit test on their own using getBoundingClientRect() or elementFromPoint()?
[12:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> We're waiting on responses from Microsoft about that.
[12:05:38] <bethge_> Do I understand correctly that, if boundary events would be left out, the behaviour during capture is similar to that of touchmove?
[12:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Touch Events avoids hit testing.
[12:07:29] <bethge_> So that would give pointer events the powerful ability to fully avoid hit testing. For all kinds of reasons, not just capturing for a button.
[12:08:08] <bethge_> Iirc constant hit testing was chrome's reason for dropping out for PE1.0.
[12:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> Correct, if you capture you can avoid hit testing completely (assuming we don't send boundary events).
[12:10:05] <bethge_> Thus, no one would have to stick to touch events for high-performance interactions, since pointer events with capture can deliver the same. I feel like that would be a great plus.
[12:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, Chrome is still committed to avoiding hit testing.
[12:12:06] <bethge_> I will grab some popcorn and see how it turns it.
[12:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have anything else to discuss today?
[12:14:33] <bethge_> Nope.
[12:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today then.
[12:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:15:35] <bethge_> Great, thanks :)
[14:02:24] <arschmitz> agcolom: apsdehal cgack cogwurx gabrielschulhof sfrisk meeting time
[14:02:32] <cgack> Howdy
[14:02:35] <gabrielschulhof> Hey! Sorry I missed last week's meeting!
[14:02:36] <apsdehal> hi
[14:02:36] <sfrisk> yo
[14:02:45] <cogwurx> hello!
[14:03:32] <agcolom> hello
[14:04:35] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:04:47] <arschmitz> and lets start with select menu
[14:04:57] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=312665471
[14:04:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: did you look at the changes i made in UI?
[14:05:32] <gabrielschulhof> No, sorry! Looking ...
[14:06:46] <arschmitz> it wont effect other widgets
[14:06:54] <arschmitz> other then to work as people probably expect
[14:07:21] <arschmitz> but it will require changes to what you did to selectmenu since you didnt wait for the change
[14:08:23] <gabrielschulhof> That's fine. Have you pulled it into mobile?
[14:08:35] <arschmitz> no its still a PR in ui but will land this week
[14:09:36] <gabrielschulhof> Excellent! I'll be happy to update to it once it lands.
[14:10:40] <arschmitz> basicly it only effects classes that are ui-corner-*
[14:10:56] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, OK, so it reconciles them.
[14:12:29] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so basically, by putting a widget inside a controlgroup you willingly give up control over the corner classes in those class keys that are listed in the _<widgetname>_options() method.
[14:14:13] <arschmitz> well thats the only thing control group does half the time lol
[14:14:31] <arschmitz> the main job of control group is to manage conrener classes
[14:15:13] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that's good, and expected. I mean, if you start specifying corner classes on your own, well, maybe you shouldn't be using a controlgroup, right?
[14:15:16] <gabrielschulhof> So, that's cool.
[14:15:23] <arschmitz> right
[14:16:10] <arschmitz> found some other bugs being addressed with controlgroup too
[14:16:29] <arschmitz> like it not applying left corners on single element controlgroups
[14:16:45] <gabrielschulhof> Oh yeah, single element is a special case for sure.
[14:19:39] <arschmitz> so that was the main thing i had this week
[14:19:58] <arschmitz> probably worth mentioning https://github.com/jquery-foundation/standards/issues/31#issuecomment-220406276
[14:20:28] <arschmitz> not directly related to jqm but mobile / app related for sure
[14:21:34] <arschmitz> apsdehal: i know last week you had questions for gabrielschulhof
[14:21:34] <gabrielschulhof> Is there something better in the works to replace it?
[14:21:42] <apsdehal> Yes
[14:21:47] <arschmitz> service workers
[14:21:48] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: What's up?
[14:22:05] <apsdehal> yo, wanted to ask about some old issues
[14:22:37] <apsdehal> First is controversial one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7588
[14:23:37] <gabrielschulhof> I think the milestone is right.
[14:24:18] <apsdehal> arschmitz has a rewrite in his pocket
[14:24:24] <apsdehal> but that is not complete
[14:24:33] <apsdehal> https://github.com/arschmitz/simple-panel
[14:25:03] <apsdehal> Ok, let's keep that milestone, I will try to work on it.
[14:25:26] <apsdehal> What about this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8066
[14:25:48] <apsdehal> Any plans of picking this up again, I remember that in some meeting you said it would be difficult to rebase
[14:26:04] <apsdehal> A whole rewrite is better I suppose
[14:26:10] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, and UI's is not ready, IIRC.
[14:26:38] <gabrielschulhof> So, I'm going to pick up https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8067 again.
[14:26:44] <apsdehal> Should we close this, or should we keep it in the pipeline?
[14:26:51] <gabrielschulhof> Keep it.
[14:26:56] <apsdehal> Ok
[14:27:12] <gabrielschulhof> This is an internal issue, so it shouldn't affect the release.
[14:27:20] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6613
[14:27:43] <apsdehal> I think this can be safely closed?
[14:28:38] <gabrielschulhof> I'm not sure, actually.
[14:28:49] <gabrielschulhof> That looks like a pretty easy issue, actually.
[14:29:02] <gabrielschulhof> To fix, I mean.
[14:29:26] <apsdehal> Ok, let me add it to my tasks
[14:29:55] <apsdehal> So this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8393
[14:30:18] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: For https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6613 we should discuss which option to pick.
[14:30:25] <apsdehal> is linked with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6898
[14:30:51] <apsdehal> which was closed by you, and I can confirm it is still not fixed in latest and 1.5-dev
[14:31:25] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: So, you can no longer reproduce https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8393 on any platform we support?
[14:31:41] <apsdehal> No I can reproduce that one also
[14:31:55] <apsdehal> both of them are actually there
[14:32:00] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, sorry! Misread.
[14:32:04] <apsdehal> I just wanted to bring to your notice the old one
[14:33:12] <apsdehal> So what do you suggest about #6613
[14:33:44] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6613 - we should discuss it.
[14:34:02] <apsdehal> Yes, what do you suggest?
[14:34:04] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: We should decide how to replace those settings.
[14:34:35] <gabrielschulhof> I would say a new options called "transition" should do the trick.
[14:34:44] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: What do you think?
[14:34:50] <arschmitz> wait so we already have in and out for all transitions
[14:35:05] <arschmitz> and they are chosen by the navigation direction
[14:35:21] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, but the base name should be configurable.
[14:35:37] <gabrielschulhof> Like "pop" vs. "fade"
[14:35:59] <arschmitz> it is but now the default is just what page uses because there are only pages
[14:36:07] <gabrielschulhof> Though actually, the option may not make it possible to have different transitions for dialogs vs. pages.
[14:36:33] <arschmitz> you can always specify it directly on the page / dialog if you want different
[14:36:35] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, and unfortunately, extension do not work per-instance. They apply to all instances.
[14:36:44] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, yeah. Duuuh!
[14:37:08] <arschmitz> so im not really sure there is a problem to fix here
[14:37:16] <arschmitz> defaultDialog goes away with dialogs
[14:37:32] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so we just drop the two conf values?
[14:37:36] <arschmitz> dialogs are just a style of page and therefore use page transition
[14:37:45] <arschmitz> well we still need one
[14:37:57] <arschmitz> we should still have efaultPageTransition
[14:38:14] <gabrielschulhof> If we had a "transition" option, we wouldn't need such a global setting.
[14:38:23] <gabrielschulhof> Less framework, more widgets.
[14:38:26] <arschmitz> true
[14:38:36] <apsdehal> Makes them more independent
[14:38:37] <arschmitz> right now the decision is outside the widget though
[14:38:44] <arschmitz> so that would be a fair bit of work
[14:38:51] <arschmitz> its part of nav not page
[14:39:19] <arschmitz> or might be pagecontainer now need to check
[14:39:25] <gabrielschulhof> pagecontainer.
[14:39:32] <apsdehal> arschmitz: What about rest of the widgets they would also require transitions property?
[14:39:35] <gabrielschulhof> It ends up in the page change options.
[14:39:46] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: I don't think so. Just page.
[14:39:58] <arschmitz> pagecontainer
[14:40:17] <arschmitz> there are no other widgets that require it
[14:41:12] <gabrielschulhof> Actually, yeah ... pagecontainer is a better place for it.
[14:41:26] <gabrielschulhof> Page needs not be aware of transitions.
[14:41:39] <arschmitz> so it should be internalized to page container
[14:41:45] <arschmitz> as an option
[14:42:02] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, but one that can be overridden on a link, right?
[14:42:10] <gabrielschulhof> The pagecontainer's option serves as the default.
[14:42:26] <gabrielschulhof> That should actually make the code simpler.
[14:44:12] <arschmitz> yup
[14:44:15] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:44:50] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so, apsdehal, I summarized our discussion as a comment on the issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6613#issuecomment-220416425
[14:44:51] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6898
[14:45:00] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: yes, thanks
[14:45:13] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: Yeah, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6898 is pretty sensitive.
[14:45:30] <apsdehal> links to many other issues too
[14:45:48] <gabrielschulhof> There's really no way to do auto*shrink* in addition to autogrow without jumping to zero size and back to what it should be.
[14:45:54] <gabrielschulhof> ... and that tends to cause havoc.
[14:46:26] <apsdehal> There are workarounds provided by the people on SO
[14:46:52] <apsdehal> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18262729/how-to-stop-window-jumping-when-typing-in-autoresizing-textarea
[14:47:40] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: That's what I did. I saved scrollTop(), since scrollLeft() is usually not an issue for us.
[14:47:57] <apsdehal> But issue was still not fixed :(
[14:48:13] <apsdehal> http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/65/edit?html,output
[14:48:17] <gabrielschulhof> I know. It's not an effective fix.
[14:48:34] <apsdehal> Should we reopen it or let it remain closed?
[14:48:46] <apsdehal> Because I am not sure we will be able to find a good fix
[14:48:58] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that's true.
[14:49:23] <apsdehal> Also it is somewhat not really related to jqm
[14:49:34] <apsdehal> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20139136/typing-in-autoresizing-textarea-keeps-on-focusing-at-the-top-of-the-element?rq=1
[14:49:42] <gabrielschulhof> Well, it is, because we have an autogrow option.
[14:50:14] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Thoughts?
[14:50:37] <arschmitz> i would keep it closed but as patches welcome
[14:50:50] <apsdehal> What about similar other issues?
[14:50:53] <arschmitz> meaning we dont think there is a better way but if someone finds one we are open to it
[14:51:16] <apsdehal> Ok, I will comment and close with that
[14:51:46] <apsdehal> Last: What should we do about this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8320
[14:52:55] <arschmitz> close it
[14:53:00] <arschmitz> we will replace with hammer tap
[14:53:18] <arschmitz> and not worry abuot it or send people to hammer to complain
[14:53:35] <arschmitz> :-p
[14:53:45] <apsdehal> Ok. Hammer is in 1.6 milestone, right?
[14:53:50] <arschmitz> yes
[14:54:04] <apsdehal> Ok. Thanks gabrielschulhof arschmitz. That is all I have
[14:54:57] <arschmitz> does any one else have anything for today?
[14:55:37] <gabrielschulhof> I'm good.
[14:55:50] <gabrielschulhof> Looking forward to that controlgroup fix!
[14:56:11] <cgack> i don't have anything
[14:56:14] <arschmitz> it will be landed and hopefully a new ui rc before next meeting
[14:56:25] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Will you then pull it into 1.5-dev?
[14:56:33] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah
[14:56:40] <gabrielschulhof> Awesome!
[14:56:41] <arschmitz> we will pull in rc3
[14:56:48] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, OK. Cool!
[14:59:25] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Any dates for 1.5 since selectmenu will land soon?
[14:59:39] <arschmitz> no we dont do dates
[14:59:41] <arschmitz> ever
[14:59:46] <apsdehal> ::(
[14:59:46] <gabrielschulhof> figs?
[14:59:51] <arschmitz> on any of the jquery projects
[15:00:01] <arschmitz> its always asap
[15:00:18] <arschmitz> depends on hw quick things get done
[15:00:20] <arschmitz> like docs
[15:01:26] <gabrielschulhof> I have to go. L8R all!
[15:02:48] <arschmitz> by
[15:02:49] <arschmitz> e
[15:03:15] <arschmitz> anything else?
[15:03:44] <apsdehal> Nope
[15:04:35] <arschmitz> ok see everyone next week
[15:05:52] <cogwurx> bye!
