[12:05:07] <arschmitz> hi
[12:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Want to give an update on the various tickets you've got going?
[12:05:22] <arschmitz> sure
[12:05:40] <arschmitz> im going to push the PR changs after meeting
[12:05:46] <arschmitz> for the controlgroup pr
[12:06:04] <arschmitz> the issue that came in today i have a branch ready to PR but it depends on the other controlgroup pr
[12:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:06:48] <arschmitz> the third issue with dialog i know how to fix i just have not got to yet
[12:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:08:19] <jzaefferer> I guess a good thing about a slow release schedule: We get people who actually test our release candidates
[12:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> I think I've got the notes for all of that correct in the agenda, can you confirm?
[12:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we've been getting good feedback.
[12:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably start planning longer RC periods.
[12:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to get to RC faster.
[12:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> Should be easier for 1.13.
[12:09:21] <arschmitz> yup
[12:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> So, themes zip...
[12:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> It's fixed and deployed.
[12:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> BUT
[12:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason the zip on production is still the old one.
[12:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> The zip on stage updated properly.
[12:10:48] <arschmitz> :-/
[12:17:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to SSH to the server and run a deploy.
[12:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> See if that fixes it.
[12:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, finally got into the server.
[12:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> I can confirm that it has the updated zip.
[12:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> Running a deploy.
[12:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> And the deploy updated the zip.
[12:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> So that means the deploy didn't happen before.
[12:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder why.
[12:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> And now the site is serving the new zip
[12:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> HOORAY!
[12:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> So here's our list of remaining bugs for 1.12.0: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/17?V=1.12.0
[12:30:02] <scott_gonzalez> They'll all be addressed pretty quickly by arschmitz.
[12:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> So we can probably do the release before next week's meeting.
[12:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Or anything that they think needs to happen prior to the release?
[12:31:31] <arschmitz> nope
[12:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a small update for the upgrade guide, but that's easy.
[12:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you want to keep this open or just close until we can actually get this working? https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/127
[12:33:53] <jzaefferer> Close and turn of the Travis integration, so it stops sending failure notes for everything...
[12:34:31] <jzaefferer> Done both
[12:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, I guess that's all for today.
[12:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
