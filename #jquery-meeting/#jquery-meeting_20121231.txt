[09:00:09] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:01:48] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron mikesherov gibson042 meeting time!
[09:01:53] <DaveMethvin> and anyone else online
[09:01:59] <mikesherov> hi
[09:02:00] <rwaldron> here!
[09:02:13] <DaveMethvin> so, i landed everything to get an idea of size
[09:02:14] <gibson042> ready
[09:02:32] <DaveMethvin> we're at about 29900
[09:02:37] <DaveMethvin> not counting data
[09:02:44] <DaveMethvin> and some support.js cleanups
[09:02:48] <DaveMethvin> but there are some fails
[09:02:55] <DaveMethvin> so i figured it might be good to fix them first
[09:02:58] <rwaldron> I'm pulling now
[09:03:03] <rwaldron> to get up to speed with you
[09:03:24] <DaveMethvin> timmywil made some changes to support.js with his changes
[09:03:32] <rwaldron> yep
[09:03:51] <rwaldron> that's what I predicted in my mind as I pulled this stuff
[09:03:53] <DaveMethvin> the test checks for support.js still seem useful to me
[09:04:08] <DaveMethvin> those tell us when the expected values change
[09:04:18] <DaveMethvin> so we know when it's okay to remove a support check
[09:04:29] <rwaldron> yes
[09:04:34] <rwaldron> I campaigned for that
[09:04:47] <DaveMethvin> let me start an agenda
[09:05:00] <rwaldron> IIRC, some argued with me that "[testing for the sake of testing isn't helpful]"
[09:05:59] <DaveMethvin> i think it's useful so that when all supported browsers end up not needing the test, we can leave it out
[09:06:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin... I started with fresh branch from current master
[09:06:24] <rwaldron> nevermind
[09:06:26] <rwaldron> strike
[09:07:33] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin how should we organize 2.0 bugs
[09:07:38] <DaveMethvin> btw first commit we need is for testswarm
[09:07:40] <rwaldron> (for this landing spree)
[09:07:49] <DaveMethvin> new browserset
[09:08:03] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: bugs? which ones?
[09:08:10] <rwaldron> sorry, not "bugs"
[09:08:13] <rwaldron> "fails"
[09:08:28] <rwaldron> are there enough to warrant a google docs spread sheet
[09:08:38] <DaveMethvin> no, i think they can be fixed before landing
[09:08:47] <rwaldron> great
[09:08:56] <DaveMethvin> i was just lazy and didn't run full tests after landing each set of commits
[09:09:03] <DaveMethvin> so imma go back and do it clean
[09:09:25] <rwaldron> Ok, so how will we keep track of fails by browser?
[09:09:39] <rwaldron> I'm looking at only 2 failed tests in Chrome
[09:10:00] <rwaldron> 6210 test of 6212 passed, 2 failed.
[09:10:05] <DaveMethvin> which ones failed?
[09:10:12] <DaveMethvin> you're doing better than me
[09:10:13] <rwaldron> ajax: jQuery.getJSON() - Using Native JSON
[09:10:17] <rwaldron> this is on me
[09:10:24] <rwaldron> (I think?)
[09:10:33] <rwaldron> ...assuming the blame gets back to core
[09:11:36] <rwaldron> ohh cool
[09:11:42] <rwaldron> this test can actually be removed.
[09:11:55] <DaveMethvin> but we shouldn't need to remove it, right?
[09:12:00] <rwaldron> you'll see
[09:12:01] <rwaldron> one sec
[09:12:08] <gibson042> ah, I get it
[09:12:11] <rwaldron> we actually DO need to remove it
[09:12:24] <rwaldron> it's no longer a valid thing that jQuery does
[09:12:28] <DaveMethvin> oh let me look at the code
[09:12:36] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/ajax.js#L1638-L1655
[09:12:40] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[09:12:56] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, I agree
[09:13:09] <rwaldron> The test itself is invalid to jQuery now
[09:13:26] <rwaldron> you did ajax, can you remove that block and push to that branch?
[09:13:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i wanted to remove the head commit anyway
[09:13:49] <DaveMethvin> that's the one orkel suggested we skip
[09:13:56] <DaveMethvin> b/c ie9 still needs it supposedly
[09:14:09] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[09:16:07] <DaveMethvin> imma force-push this since i removed a commit
[09:16:17] <DaveMethvin> the pull request that is
[09:17:08] <DaveMethvin> ok ie9 passed
[09:18:10] <DaveMethvin> aw damn it has the source vrsion update
[09:18:25] <DaveMethvin> well if we land that first it would be fine
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> but we need to also land the change to the browserset or this thing will fail a ton on oldie
[09:19:59] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron did you just merge all the pull requests to get your successful run?
[09:20:09] <DaveMethvin> i must have done something different to get those fails
[09:21:17] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: you said you had some 1.9+ ticket fixes to land?
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> which ones?
[09:21:29] <mikesherov> the ones I'm assigned too
[09:21:44] <DaveMethvin> oh, trying to throw us off the track, eh? :P
[09:21:46] <mikesherov> ?12846
[09:21:48] <bot-t> [#12846] overflow:hidden is not removed when .stop() is called (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/12846
[09:21:58] <mikesherov> ?13088
[09:21:59] <bot-t> [#13088]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/13088
[09:22:14] <mikesherov> that's pretty much it
[09:22:27] <mikesherov> also would like to talk about the speed framework stuff
[09:22:31] <mikesherov> dromareoeoeoeoeo
[09:22:36] <mikesherov> vs. what sizzle uses
[09:22:45] <DaveMethvin> those two should be easy to cherry pick
[09:22:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah, we definitely could use some speed tests
[09:23:02] <mikesherov> yes, no big deal
[09:23:12] <mikesherov> rwaldron: thoughts?>
[09:23:54] <DaveMethvin> some simple regression "database" would be handy to compare perf over time
[09:24:15] <DaveMethvin> in my dream world we'd do the perf regression tests against commits
[09:24:32] <gibson042> fwiw, I've never seen Sizzle's benchmark.js work right on IE
[09:25:10] <DaveMethvin> it seems like testswarm has quite a bit of perf variation from run to run
[09:25:17] <DaveMethvin> so i'm not sure we'd get valid results there
[09:25:22] <mikesherov> my thoughts are, we should have nothing in the repo that isn't maintained
[09:25:34] <mikesherov> for example, we have all these manual tests too
[09:25:52] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: several of those were for oldIE and can be removed
[09:25:58] <DaveMethvin> i can take a look thru them
[09:26:02] <mikesherov> I'm not so concerned with how we run them, as I am with what strategy we have moving forward
[09:26:15] <mikesherov> there's a ton of crap in theree
[09:27:01] <DaveMethvin> well the problem is that we don't currently run perf tests
[09:27:07] <DaveMethvin> so any perf-related stuff just goes stale
[09:27:22] <DaveMethvin> so unless we have some automated runs that yell when they break
[09:27:29] <DaveMethvin> this stuff won't be maintained
[09:27:52] <DaveMethvin> i just am not sure whether we can run these on testswarm for example and get reproducible results
[09:28:54] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sorry, yes that's what I did
[09:29:06] <rwaldron> starting from the oldest and working forward
[09:29:22] <DaveMethvin> okay well i must have done something different :D
[09:29:35] <DaveMethvin> so are you getting a clean run now rwaldron?
[09:30:28] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin running in chrome now
[09:30:37] <rwaldron> (sorry, I had stepped away for a few minutes)
[09:30:46] <DaveMethvin> as far as commits, we need to update the source version, change the browserset in the grunt, then land the changes on top of that
[09:30:48] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I hear you
[09:31:45] <DaveMethvin> do we have any good examples of projects that do CI perf tests?
[09:32:11] <rwaldron> sort of
[09:32:14] <DaveMethvin> for sites like github i know they do monitoring, but that kind of perf testign doesn't work for us
[09:33:06] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I built a framerate testing system
[09:33:08] <rwaldron> https://github.com/facebook/rng.io/blob/master/tests/ring-1-performance/test.js
[09:33:32] <mikesherov> And I can make sure that once we choose dromaraoeoeoeoeo vs. Sizzle harness, I can move forward with purpose
[09:34:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that test basically fires up this: https://github.com/facebook/rng.io/blob/master/tests/_resources/framerate-sprite.html
[09:34:19] <rwaldron> which does some animating and samples the framerate
[09:34:28] <rwaldron> it's "eh" at best
[09:35:00] <rwaldron> but for what it does, it's surprisingly accurate for detecting even "preceived" performance
[09:35:24] <DaveMethvin> So exactly what do we want from our perf tests?
[09:35:39] <rwaldron> what are hot paths?
[09:35:42] <rwaldron> each
[09:35:54] <rwaldron> anything into domManip
[09:36:00] <rwaldron> anything into events
[09:36:57] <DaveMethvin> what can we do for a first cut?
[09:37:04] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at dromeo
[09:37:18] <DaveMethvin> does that help us at all?
[09:37:23] <rwaldron> It could
[09:37:32] <mikesherov> anything in effects as well
[09:37:44] <rwaldron> mikesherov +1 (sorry I missed that)
[09:37:46] <DaveMethvin> for now i'd  just like something that exercises the api and let us know the time/call for the apis
[09:37:59] <rwaldron> Dromaeo could be exceptionally useful
[09:37:59] <DaveMethvin> so we'd know if we broke something badly
[09:38:07] <rwaldron> but it needs to be re-written from the ground up
[09:38:13] <DaveMethvin> oh is that all? :)
[09:38:17] <rwaldron> (this is a matter of opinion)
[09:38:47] <DaveMethvin> i would love to have something automated
[09:38:52] <rwaldron> well, it uses Perl
[09:39:08] <rwaldron> I'd like to re-write Dromaeo in JS
[09:39:41] <DaveMethvin> avoiding another dep would be nice
[09:39:45] <mikesherov> what about what sizzle's using? or benchmark.js?
[09:39:46] <rwaldron> at _very_ least, with the help of mikesherov
[09:39:53] <DaveMethvin> but so would getting som basic stuff done for a first cut
[09:40:13] <rwaldron> mikesherov jdalton and I have discussed re-writing dromaeo with benchmark.js
[09:40:24] <rwaldron> It's just a matter of having the time to do it.
[09:40:59] <rwaldron> In a perfect world, I'd like a system that stored results in a central registry
[09:41:14] <DaveMethvin> right, i agree but am okay with something simpler for now
[09:41:25] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin of course
[09:41:29] <DaveMethvin> esp until we understand the variance we're gonna see
[09:41:39] <rwaldron> mikesherov are you down for building such a thing with me?
[09:41:45] <mikesherov> sure
[09:41:48] <rwaldron> great
[09:41:51] <DaveMethvin> also i don't want to get too focused on the micro-path optimizations
[09:41:52] <mikesherov> that's why I brought it up :-)
[09:42:05] <rwaldron> mikesherov I think you should actually lead it
[09:42:12] <mikesherov> :-)
[09:42:13] <rwaldron> and I will follow your lead
[09:42:38] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin agreed. I think big picture hot-paths are important
[09:42:39] <mikesherov> OK, let's talk later this week about it
[09:42:42] <mikesherov> Wednesday?
[09:42:44] <rwaldron> like event dispatch
[09:42:51] <rwaldron> animation, etc.
[09:42:52] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:42:56] <rwaldron> mikesherov sure
[09:43:45] <DaveMethvin> alrighty
[09:43:46] <mikesherov> great!
[09:43:49] <rwaldron> Also...
[09:43:51] <rwaldron> one last thing
[09:44:04] <rwaldron> I'd like to consider abandoning jQuery Core Style Guide
[09:44:14] <rwaldron> in favor of automation via js-beautify
[09:44:19] <rwaldron> with simple rules
[09:44:23] <DaveMethvin> how different is js-beautify?
[09:44:45] <DaveMethvin> i am in favor of the principle
[09:44:59] <DaveMethvin> since none of us seem to either know or follow the current rules entirely :D
[09:45:02] <rwaldron> not very, but it surely won't support our "exceptions"
[09:45:38] <DaveMethvin> if we can automate it, then that would be very fine
[09:45:43] <rwaldron> yes
[09:45:52] <rwaldron> but I'm not sure "how"
[09:45:59] <rwaldron> what step of development does that happen?
[09:46:03] <rwaldron> I'd like something like...
[09:46:11] <rwaldron> 1. write a patch
[09:46:15] <rwaldron> 2. test the patch
[09:46:47] <rwaldron> 3. run a grunt task to format it (w/ js-beautify)
[09:46:55] <rwaldron> 4. commit, push => PR
[09:47:14] <DaveMethvin> style guide changes can be squashed into the previous commits during rebase without too much trouble by the person who lands it
[09:47:25] <DaveMethvin> assuming we're rebasing as a standard practice
[09:47:56] <rwaldron> true, but it would be just as easy for a contributor to do their part
[09:48:02] <rwaldron> it's not a big ask
[09:48:10] <DaveMethvin> oh sure
[09:48:23] <DaveMethvin> perhaps just a grunt task, like  you say
[09:48:46] <DaveMethvin> they can do a commit --amend to avoid the extra commit as well
[09:48:59] <DaveMethvin> we can have instructions on how to do it
[09:49:33] <mikesherov> g2g guys, I support 100% of what rwaldron is saying
[09:49:41] <DaveMethvin> ok, cool
[09:49:47] <DaveMethvin> thanks for fixing those tix mikesherov
[09:49:51] <mikesherov> np
[09:49:58] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: do you want to land the 2.0 changes?
[09:50:22] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin as in... to master?
[09:50:29] <DaveMethvin> we do need to get the vesion update and browsersets in ahead of that tho
[09:50:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:50:35] <rwaldron> sure
[09:50:41] <rwaldron> should I squash these?
[09:50:43] <DaveMethvin> whatsa matter, CHICKEN mcfly?
[09:50:55] <DaveMethvin> i wouln't squash them
[09:50:56] <rwaldron> I dont think these should be squashed
[09:51:16] <rwaldron> sure then, let me run through once more
[09:51:20] <rwaldron> see if I missed anything
[09:51:21] <DaveMethvin> so before you push the button
[09:51:42] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: is the version update to 2.0.0pre in there first?
[09:52:04] <DaveMethvin> and we also need to change the browserset in Gruntfile to "popular-no-old-ie"
[09:52:11] <rwaldron> got it.
[09:52:15] <DaveMethvin> right now it's coming out of the testswarm config
[09:52:33] <DaveMethvin> but otherwise if it's all passing, then it should be ready to go
[09:52:59] <DaveMethvin> let me push the 1.9-stable branch now, i just need to merge in mike's commits
[09:55:10] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin so... I just remembered that Julian asked us to hold off on ajax
[09:55:13] <rwaldron> should I omit?
[09:55:42] <DaveMethvin> if you pulled the new one, the only thing i removed was the old activex
[09:55:53] <DaveMethvin> so it should be safe as a baseline for him
[09:56:17] <rwaldron> ok, but his comment: "Well, it's not that the commit is bad in itself, but it is a bit too wide (as orkel pointed out) and it doesn't take advantage of new handlers (onload, onerror) which makes the use of isLocal and all the logic associated unnecessary. I'd prefer we wait a few day so that I can test what I have home properly and make a PR with it. I won't base my work off the PR here anyway."
[09:56:32] <DaveMethvin> oh, what' i have home
[09:56:37] <DaveMethvin> ok then let's leave that one out
[09:56:40] <rwaldron> ok
[09:57:25] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, so I'm pulling these onto master... have you branched 1.9?
[09:57:33] <rwaldron> i don't see it on the list of branches
[09:57:44] <DaveMethvin> just doing a test to be sure
[09:57:46] <DaveMethvin> hold on a sec
[09:57:48] <rwaldron> ok
[09:59:39] <rwaldron> Also, the version needs to be updated...
[09:59:59] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: okay, new branch is there
[10:00:00] <DaveMethvin> yes
[10:00:00] <rwaldron> in build/release-notes.js?
[10:00:08] <rwaldron> in package.json
[10:00:11] <rwaldron> both
[10:00:12] <rwaldron> ?
[10:00:18] <DaveMethvin> don't worry about release-notes
[10:00:21] <rwaldron> ok
[10:00:28] <DaveMethvin> package.jston needs a commit BEFORE the others
[10:00:37] <rwaldron> yes
[10:00:49] <DaveMethvin> and also the grunt update needs to come before or it will test with oldie
[10:00:57] <DaveMethvin> and we know it wont'
[10:01:01] <DaveMethvin>  like that :D
[10:04:28] <DaveMethvin> okay, let's call the meeting done and take this to #jquery-dev ... thanks guys!
