[14:04:35] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:04:43] <sfrisk> kristjy, nashvail, geekman-rohit, arschmitz
[14:05:08] <nashvail> What up?
[14:05:30] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:05:46] <kristy> hey
[14:06:01] <sfrisk> First up is a documentation add: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/158/files
[14:06:22] <sfrisk> if everyone is okay with wording, we can pull it into master
[14:07:17] <geekman-rohit> hey everyone
[14:07:19] <sfrisk> hey
[14:07:26] <sfrisk> going over https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/158/files
[14:07:43] <sfrisk> seeing if there is any wording tweaks we want before pulling it in
[14:08:07] <nashvail> Can it be like instead of the comman we have " To run grunt tests locally: "
[14:08:36] <sfrisk> I'm trying to remember the proper grammar there
[14:08:36] <nashvail> and the Run ... IDK
[14:08:46] <sfrisk> maybe tdo
[14:08:49] <sfrisk> maybe do:
[14:08:53] <sfrisk> Grunt Tests
[14:09:00] <sfrisk> To run the tests locally run:
[14:09:10] <sfrisk> *grunt test code here*
[14:09:10] <geekman-rohit> and say Pull Requests in full maybe
[14:09:20] <nashvail> yeah
[14:09:24] <kristyjy> okay sounds good
[14:09:27] <sfrisk> followed by "Before creating a pull request or committing to a pull request, make sure to always run your tests"
[14:09:29] <sfrisk> or whatever
[14:10:04] <geekman-rohit> Make Sure you run the tests before creating a pull request
[14:10:21] <sfrisk> That works
[14:10:57] <sfrisk> kristjy - ping me when those changes are done in the issue?
[14:11:00] <sfrisk> I can pull it in then
[14:11:45] <kristyjy> cool can do
[14:11:59] <sfrisk> next up is tables
[14:12:20] <sfrisk> I think if I remember correctly, kristy has turned everything to classes
[14:12:25] <sfrisk> and made div versions of tables
[14:13:06] <geekman-rohit> div version?
[14:13:11] <geekman-rohit> is there a demo
[14:13:28] <sfrisk> I could merge it into a branch
[14:13:32] <sfrisk> so it's up on views
[14:14:18] <geekman-rohit> thatd be good
[14:14:29] <geekman-rohit> thatd be good
[14:14:53] <kristyjy> yes it's all classes now. Probably still needs a little love but I'd love some reviews first
[14:15:03] <geekman-rohit> so I may not have paid attention last meeting
[14:15:20] <geekman-rohit> so we can have a table without a table tag right?
[14:15:26] <geekman-rohit> using just classes
[14:15:32] <kristyjy> yup
[14:15:38] <sfrisk> yeah, all classes based
[14:15:47] * geekman-rohit approves
[14:15:49] <sfrisk> so if you need it to be div based (for responsive reasons, for example) you can
[14:16:16] * geekman-rohit thinks thats very useful
[14:16:18] <sfrisk> similar to how we handled button stylings
[14:16:32] <geekman-rohit> but in buttons all frameworks do it
[14:16:38] <geekman-rohit> not many approach tables like that
[14:16:54] <sfrisk> there was a really good post on css-tricks about responsifying tables
[14:17:05] <sfrisk> I think if we had tables well thought out in other devices, that could set us apart
[14:17:18] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[14:17:42] <kristyjy> yeah my only wonder is accessibility but we could probably use more than just divs for more semantic markup later on
[14:17:42] <geekman-rohit> Fixed th table would be nice
[14:17:45] <geekman-rohit> maybe
[14:17:49] <geekman-rohit> fixed thead*
[14:18:01] <geekman-rohit> so we dont lose track of what was heading in large tables
[14:18:17] <sfrisk> added a screenshot: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/151
[14:18:20] <geekman-rohit> but thatd need js
[14:18:52] <sfrisk> https://css-tricks.com/accessible-simple-responsive-tables/
[14:18:56] <geekman-rohit> so we have a requirement at work
[14:19:01] <sfrisk> accessible responsive tables
[14:19:07] <geekman-rohit> to have tables with thead fixed
[14:19:20] <sfrisk> fixed thead is a paaaaain
[14:19:22] <kristyjy> I should add a note that the bottom one is the div table.. It was a bit late at night when I committed this :D lol
[14:19:26] <geekman-rohit> and the left td's too
[14:19:39] <geekman-rohit> so I decided to use div's instead of tables
[14:19:42] <sfrisk> unless you can guarantee that each cell has the same width
[14:19:46] <geekman-rohit> if we had chassis
[14:19:54] <geekman-rohit> a lot of my pain would have been saved
[14:20:05] <sfrisk> but that link about has some different ideas of what we could with tables to make them responsive
[14:23:29] <sfrisk> so review the table, we could call it good for base table styling
[14:23:35] <sfrisk> then open a ticket for how we want to expand tables
[14:23:42] <sfrisk> also I think we should have a full width table option
[14:25:47] <kristyjy> yeah works for me :)
[14:26:24] <sfrisk> So create ticket, link it to the css-tricks article, with the purpose of exploring how we want to handle responsive tables
[14:27:25] <sfrisk> including horizontal scrolling, fixed thead, and chaing positioning of cells in mobile to make it easy to read while remaining accessible
[14:29:02] <sfrisk> Okay, so it doesn't look like images has been updated
[14:29:16] <sfrisk> Style guide, nashvail you mentioned doing some work
[14:29:26] <nashvail> Yes one sec
[14:29:28] <sfrisk> I did update the issue today with some cases I could think of
[14:29:34] <nashvail> should I share the sketch file with you too ?
[14:29:42] <sfrisk> that would be cool
[14:30:12] <nashvail> I'll just drop it here.
[14:30:36] <nashvail> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/0yiRBXNC/Chasis%20UI%20Guide%20%5BWIP%5D.sketch
[14:30:49] <sfrisk> oooo!
[14:30:51] <nashvail> So first off I experimented with the size of buttons
[14:30:52] <sfrisk> I loke the input states!
[14:31:07] <nashvail> They're not much but took a number of iterations to get right
[14:31:27] <sfrisk> still, I like it
[14:31:58] <nashvail> I'll just put an image of it here so everyone can see
[14:32:13] <nashvail> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/zQsAM97P/Screen%20Shot%202016-05-17%20at%2011.59.56%20PM.png
[14:32:21] <sfrisk> oh, something I just thought of Re: buttons
[14:32:27] <kristyjy> looks good!
[14:32:34] <sfrisk> I'll add this to issues, but having icons on a button
[14:32:42] <sfrisk> either icon + text
[14:32:44] <sfrisk> or just icon
[14:33:11] <nashvail> I read somewhere they're called butcons? IDK
[14:33:28] <nashvail> I read that in About Face 3 . I remember totally out of context
[14:33:29] <sfrisk> no idea
[14:33:37] <nashvail> just ignore it
[14:33:57] <sfrisk> lol
[14:34:07] <nashvail> also sfrisk I'll need help with the button sizes if they're right
[14:34:10] <nashvail> in the size guide
[14:34:21] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:34:46] <nashvail> I was just trying to keep the w/h ratio close to 2 * golden ratio
[14:34:53] <nashvail> ignore that too ^
[14:34:57] <sfrisk> lol
[14:35:00] <sfrisk> math for buttons!
[14:35:26] <sfrisk> you could say for the buttons that's the min width (unless it's an icon butotn)
[14:35:36] <sfrisk> if you have longer text on a button, we'll want it to be wider
[14:35:40] <sfrisk> but not necessarily higher
[14:35:48] <nashvail> Yes. Totally missed that .
[14:36:25] <sfrisk> I think the next goal might be coresponding labels for the inputs?
[14:36:33] <sfrisk> both inline and also above the inputs
[14:36:59] <nashvail> Ok noted
[14:37:49] <sfrisk> if everyone likes those buttons too, I can start adjusting the buttons in the code to match that
[14:38:17] <geekman-rohit> Im on windows I dont have sketch
[14:38:23] <geekman-rohit> can someone send screenshot
[14:38:30] <nashvail> one second
[14:38:58] <nashvail> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/bktjft9I/Screen%20Shot%202016-05-18%20at%2012.08.41%20AM.png
[14:40:08] <geekman-rohit> I like our current buttons better
[14:40:19] <geekman-rohit> just my opinion
[14:40:44] <sfrisk> I do kinda like the border in the disabled view
[14:41:00] <geekman-rohit> I agree
[14:41:05] <geekman-rohit> lets take the best of bothe
[14:41:08] <geekman-rohit> both*
[14:41:15] <sfrisk> were the colors similar or different?
[14:41:34] <nashvail> I just picked the color off of the demo page
[14:41:35] <sfrisk> http://view.css-chassis.com/master/demos/buttons.html
[14:41:47] <geekman-rohit> umm borders in that disabled wont go good with our current design
[14:41:59] <geekman-rohit> im personally happy with current buttons
[14:42:22] <sfrisk> looks like that design has borders for regular and disabled
[14:42:29] <sfrisk> the arning color looks darker than the current warning color
[14:42:32] <sfrisk> warning*
[14:43:17] <sfrisk> we could also open it up in an issue
[14:43:22] <sfrisk> compare the two different versions
[14:43:26] <sfrisk> get community input
[14:43:44] <geekman-rohit> thats would be good
[14:43:58] <sfrisk> actually post the design for the inputs in #6 or #10
[14:44:07] <nashvail> yes also if someone suggests something we can incorporate that
[14:44:14] <sfrisk> to get some visibility into the design decisions
[14:44:31] <sfrisk> and post the contrast for buttons on the UI Guide issue
[14:46:12] <sfrisk> I'll ping some jquery peeps to look at it too
[14:46:17] <sfrisk> members of mobile and ui
[14:46:52] <sfrisk> okay I need to get back to work
[14:46:55] <sfrisk> anything else?
[14:47:25] <nashvail> nothing from me, I'll add more to the UI guide
[14:47:31] <sfrisk> okay
[14:47:44] <sfrisk> see everyone on the boards / #css-chassis / all that jazz
