[12:00:47] <fnagel> Hi
[12:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> I assume there's nothing to discuss for datepicker right now?
[12:02:29] <fnagel> no
[12:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> We're waiting on feedback from John Gunderson.
[12:02:37] <fnagel> had no time and no feedback
[12:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> I made some progress on tickets and PRs.
[12:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't get to everything for 1.12.2, but I should get to it this week.
[12:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, one of the 1.12.2 things I did get to.
[12:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> I looked into the Bower issue with minified files.
[12:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> Took a while to figure out how this bug existed, then I realized we did stop publishing minified files in our releases.
[12:04:28] <fnagel> oh
[12:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with the Bower package isn't from us.
[12:04:42] <fnagel> seems like a good reason it stopped working
[12:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> That package is maintained by someone in the community.
[12:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> And I have no idea how they generate the package.
[12:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> So I closed the ticket and linked to the relevant project.
[12:05:15] <fnagel> just drop them a line an point to our ticket?
[12:05:20] <fnagel> or that way
[12:06:53] <scott_gonzalez> I actually don't have anything else to discuss today. All the things on my list are just the remaining 1.12.2 tickets.
[12:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> So unless someone has something to discuss, I guess we're done.
[12:08:17] <fnagel> noting from my side
[12:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we're done.
[12:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks fnagel.
[12:10:55] <fnagel> bye
[12:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> bye
