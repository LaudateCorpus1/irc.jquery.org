[09:00:25] <rxaviers> hey
[09:00:45] <petersendidit> hey
[09:00:46] <tj_vantoll_phone> Hey
[09:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:01:58] <jzaefferer> oh hi
[09:02:24] <jzaefferer> Not much to say about grunt, still waiting for 0.4 to land
[09:02:30] <kborchers> here
[09:02:41] <fnagel> Hey
[09:02:44] <jzaefferer> our grunt-0-4 is on rc6, I hope we can just rebase and merge that once 0.4 is final
[09:02:50] <jzaefferer> hey, Felix made it :-)
[09:02:54] <mikesherov> hi
[09:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Hopefully. Apparently rc7 came out.
[09:03:23] <jzaefferer> regarding "view.jqueryui.com still doesn't support tags properly" - let's ask clarkbox to fix it?
[09:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> I can probably fix it if I knew where the script was.
[09:03:47] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[09:03:52] <jzaefferer> it should be in a git repo somewhere
[09:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, he knows it's a problem.
[09:04:20] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:04:28] <jzaefferer> do you know more then the above?
[09:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> but we should ping him again
[09:04:41] <jzaefferer> is this it? https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org
[09:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't use `fetch -t`
[09:04:54] <jzaefferer> oh
[09:04:59] <jzaefferer> well
[09:05:08] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org/blob/master/extractGitBranches.py#L49
[09:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess so
[09:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how that gets deployed though.
[09:06:21] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org/issues/2
[09:06:21] <b-ot> jzaefferer, issue #2 by jzaefferer (5m 21s ago): Detached commits/tags aren't fetched
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/93
[09:06:38] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/32
[09:07:52] <jzaefferer> yeah..
[09:07:59] <jzaefferer> I think add `-t` is easier for now
[09:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:08:42] <jzaefferer> well, I've added a line for esformatter
[09:08:55] <jzaefferer> the most promising tool I found so far, and the guy is interested in providing a jquery preset
[09:09:21] <jzaefferer> its still a complex task, but if it works out, the complexity will be encapsulated in that tool
[09:09:27] <jzaefferer> and we can build a simple grunt task around that
[09:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the discussion in that issue is promising.
[09:09:59] <jzaefferer> probably a generic task that just forwards whatever preset you want, doesn't has to be jQuery specific
[09:10:37] <jzaefferer> I want to get rid of this exception: "Single argument string literal, no space"
[09:10:54] <jzaefferer> It doesn't make any sense to me and we are not following that in UI anyway, afaik
[09:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> I want to get rid of all exceptions :-)
[09:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> But that one is especially annoying.
[09:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> And the array reference exception is annoying too.
[09:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's stay on top of esformatter.
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers is porting image generation to node.
[09:12:52] <jzaefferer> Array rerefence?
[09:12:59] <jzaefferer> Can you add that here? https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/21
[09:13:00] <b-ot> jzaefferer, issue #21 by jzaefferer (5m 36s ago): Drop exceptions from JS style guide
[09:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like it's almost ready to go live, just waiting on confirmation that the new imagemagick is installed in production.
[09:13:07] <jzaefferer> And yeah, I'll stay on top of esformatter.
[09:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: a[1] vs. a[ 1 ]
[09:14:19] <jzaefferer> thanks, added
[09:14:46] <rxaviers> that's right. And Im working on our biggest hitter today: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/82
[09:14:46] <b-ot> rxaviers, issue #82 by rxaviers (5d 16h ago): (RFC) 502 Bad Gateway on long urls
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> Does it look like that will get fixed today?
[09:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> I know you made a lot of progress by switching to a bitmask.
[09:15:31] <rxaviers> bitmask is almost done. Changing it caused other issues that Im fixing now.
[09:15:50] <rxaviers> bitmask will reduce a lot of bytes and hopefully address this for now.
[09:15:59] <rxaviers> that's what I hope :)
[09:16:03] <jzaefferer> Is the bitmask just for DB params?
[09:16:07] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:16:16] <jzaefferer> Can you point me at the bitmask code?
[09:16:21] <jzaefferer> I want to take a peek..
[09:16:22] <rxaviers> although, it still an open issue. What the real problem is, we dont know.
[09:16:40] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I will put it on a branch and point you.
[09:16:50] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:17:07] <scott_gonzalez> Our ticket count is going up :-/
[09:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> We're almost up to 400.
[09:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> But 8 pending.
[09:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> I should be able to start focusing on UI again next week, if not by the end of this week.
[09:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> And tackle a bunch of the bugs that came in.
[09:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get 1.10.1 out in a week or two.
[09:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like get all the regressions fixed and switch to jQuery 1.9.1.
[09:18:23] <tj_vantoll_phone> Incoming ticket count has been way up the last week or so.
[09:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> I've been able to look at some of them, but not most.
[09:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> Last week was crazy busy with the 1.10.0 release and the plugins site.
[09:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> We still have a lot of failures in TestSwarm.
[09:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> And incomplete results.
[09:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Any update on effects?
[09:23:00] <jzaefferer> I need to talk to Timo anyway...
[09:23:26] <mikesherov> yup, so I've updated them all alphabetically through fold
[09:23:45] <mikesherov> I spent significant time making sure margin-collapse issues are gone
[09:24:03] <mikesherov> including this insane bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107380
[09:24:15] <mikesherov> but it works well.
[09:24:46] <mikesherov> worked out most of the kinks, now it's just plowing through each one updating to the new helpers
[09:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:27:36] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:27:58] <jzaefferer> I want to work on dialog stuff today
[09:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> Would be great to fix the regressions.
[09:28:19] <jzaefferer> Kris' PR, some of the regressions...
[09:28:47] <jzaefferer> I've emailed Timo, to arrange a Skype meeting
[09:29:22] <kborchers> we never did hear from hans on that PR
[09:29:39] <kborchers> must be too busy these days
[09:29:46] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:29:53] <jzaefferer> I also need to test this: https://github.com/rwldrn/grunt-compare-size/pull/16
[09:29:54] <b-ot> jzaefferer, pull request #16 by gibson042 (2w 5d ago): Fix gh-13: restore MultiTask implementation
[09:32:33] <jzaefferer> guess that's it for today
[09:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to get a hold of gnarf to find out about deploying the view. script.
[09:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
