[09:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone
[09:01:34] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf kborchers tj_vantoll mikesherov petersendidit rxaviers rworth
[09:01:49] * rxaviers here
[09:01:51] <jzaefferer> and a bottle of rum!
[09:01:53] <tj_vantoll> hi
[09:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov made some progress on megeatron
[09:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> We're still only using it on core for now.
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Anything specific you'd like to say about mergeatron?
[09:04:27] <mikesherov> Yeah, it's still crashing occasionally
[09:04:34] <mikesherov> So I'm logging it now
[09:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:15] <mikesherov> and then I need to talk to gnarf about supervisor support, but it's there
[09:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we'll keep waiting :-)
[09:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> The progress so far seems good.
[09:06:27] <mikesherov> sorry :-\
[09:06:29] <gnarf> mikesherov: is it doing two repos yet?
[09:06:40] <gnarf> mikesherov: or just jquery
[09:06:52] <mikesherov> gnarf: just jquery
[09:07:00] <mikesherov> we can try adding jquery-ui
[09:07:20] <mikesherov> gnarf, for now I'm just doing "node mergeatron > log.txt &"
[09:07:24] <gnarf> I'll play with it tomorrow
[09:07:36] <mikesherov> gnarf: can you and I talk tomorrow about how we want to do serious logging?
[09:07:46] <gnarf> mikesherov: yeah, timeish?
[09:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> Let's hold off on adding it.
[09:07:55] <mikesherov> noonish
[09:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> Jenkins/TestSwarm are swamped.
[09:08:00] <gnarf> mikesherov: sounds good
[09:08:06] <mikesherov> gnarf, can you ping me?
[09:08:10] <gnarf> mikesherov: aye
[09:08:13] <mikesherov> thnx
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> The current build queue has a dozen mergeatron builds...
[09:09:51] <gnarf> i wonder if it isn't duplicating them somehow, doesn't make sense that there are that many
[09:10:11] <mikesherov> gnarf: When I restart, it queues up the ones I missed
[09:10:20] <mikesherov> and each updated pull generates a build
[09:10:33] <mikesherov> testswarm is just insanely slow
[09:10:52] <gnarf> browserstack
[09:10:59] <Krinkle> yes, thank you. browserstack not testswarm
[09:11:05] <gnarf> the API doesn't seem to be starting safari 6 builds
[09:11:09] <Krinkle> I've just removed IE7 and Safari 6 from all our active browserSets (1 hour ago)
[09:11:12] <Krinkle> it should be faster now
[09:11:29] <Krinkle> because those 2 have issues at browserstack
[09:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:11:53] <Krinkle> pending investigation, gnarf and I will help them with whatever they need (I'm setting up a debug build for them to use)
[09:12:11] <gnarf> id rather pass out the runtoken url to people so when they notice its getting behind they can do what I do, which is just start a browserstack VM pointed at it
[09:12:27] <gnarf> speaking of which - can anyone else help kill the safari 6 backlog?
[09:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Sure, just give me the URL and I'll run on it my local install.
[09:12:53] <mikesherov> browserstack, sorry. Testswarm is awesome
[09:13:05] <Krinkle> hehe
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, moving on to download builder.
[09:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: update?
[09:13:29] <Krinkle> gnarf: that'll time out after 5 minutes of mouse inactivity
[09:13:40] * Krinkle hides again
[09:13:47] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah, but when you're getting things caught up its useful
[09:13:48] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, we finally have our multi-versions front-end ready
[09:13:55] <rxaviers> Cool thing now is that anything a user changes in Donwload Builder / ThemeRoller gets url'ed. So, he can share it. We remember everything: components, folder-name (unless changed thru TR), scope, and jqui version.
[09:13:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also, remember - units don't like being the non-focus window :)
[09:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> crap
[09:14:15] <rxaviers> It had some bugs, but all fixed. From my sniff testing it seems rock solid now.
[09:14:55] <kborchers> gnarf: i can run Safari 6 for a bit … i can just leave that win focused when i go to lunch :)
[09:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, well I just ran a few. I'll run more after the meeting, while I'm eating lunch.
[09:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: great :-)
[09:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> So you're just waiting on a final review before landing in master, right?
[09:15:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer suggested to move to master and test it on stage
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's do that.
[09:16:18] <rxaviers> ok
[09:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the ThemeRoller migration is still on hold until after the verification on stage?
[09:17:34] <mikesherov> brb
[09:17:42] <gnarf> Krinkle: I think what I was saying is that I'd rather have safari 6 and ie7 in the browser set and deal with the adding clients by hand by just circulating the url to the people who will be spawning them - not having ie7 or saf6 coverage seems less desireable than having builds report "fail" because a browser lagged
[09:17:58] <gnarf> i dunno if others agree?
[09:18:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ?
[09:18:21] <Krinkle> gnarf: in the current way we can't have more than 30 commits a day, which we have easily
[09:18:30] <Krinkle> especially PRs
[09:18:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, sounds sane
[09:18:37] <rxaviers> :)
[09:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:18:41] <Krinkle> gnarf: it is temporary
[09:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Any update on switching to new-css?
[09:19:18] <Krinkle> gnarf: if we need to do a release, we can add them back or test manually with browserstack (you don't even need a run token to run the tests, the qunit link is available from the job page)
[09:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> I guess he's not here.
[09:20:58] <gnarf> Krinkle: besides, spreading the runtoken means when people are trying to "rush" a result out the door, they can manually help
[09:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I have been working through dialog bugs.
[09:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> We're down to 6 bugs for 1.10.
[09:21:26] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer has also done some cleanup of the code to use new APIs.
[09:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers cleaned up the progressbar label demo.
[09:22:39] <Krinkle> gnarf: yep :)
[09:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> We still have to review the wiki page and update the docs.
[09:22:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i updated docs yesterday would appreciate a review
[09:22:58] <kborchers> on progressbar branch
[09:23:08] <kborchers> didn't change too much from what i could tell
[09:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Ok, I've actually got "review 1.10 docs" pretty high on my list.
[09:23:36] <kborchers> added an indeterminate example at the bottom which is broken until 1.10 is available to use
[09:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> So I should get to that by tomorrow.
[09:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket triage is still going strong.
[09:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> Only 1 pending ticket.
[09:24:23] <scott_gonzalez> 374 total tickets
[09:24:24] <kborchers> also progressbar testsuite shows 98% coverage in JSCoverage
[09:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> 13 pull requests
[09:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Good to know. It's probably complete. I'll add "verify progressbar test suite coverage" to my list.
[09:25:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: let's merge all the 1.10 docs into a 1-10 branch
[09:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That's my plan after my review.
[09:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> Should happen by tomorrow.
[09:26:20] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> We'll skip the TestSwarm item, since it's been discussed already.
[09:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Petro is still going to try out clip for effects?
[09:26:53] <jzaefferer> I want to focus on Selectmenu tomorrow and Friday, along with Felix. Would be a shame to push that to a later release.
[09:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Let's wait till we get to the item to discuss it.
[09:28:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did your "yaySwarm" question ever get answered?
[09:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: no
[09:28:54] <gnarf> Krinkle: ^^^ you know why we are named "yaySwarm" ?
[09:29:24] <mikesherov> yes, petro is on it
[09:29:31] <Krinkle> gnarf: TestSwarm is the software, web.title is the instance name. The new installed asks for it, I recently partially re-installed the db and filled that in
[09:29:40] <Krinkle> installer*
[09:29:48] <mikesherov> so, WHY
[09:29:50] <Krinkle> (instead of "undefined")
[09:30:02] <mikesherov> this answers how, but not WHY
[09:30:21] <Krinkle> It's like the name of a WordPress blog (instead of "WordPress" which doesn't make sense)
[09:30:23] <gnarf> can we switch it to something like "jQuery swarm" *shrug* if we just wanted a non "testswarm" stitle
[09:30:39] <Krinkle> mikesherov: well, to avoid confusion with TestSwarm
[09:30:43] <Krinkle> Sure
[09:30:53] <gnarf> i mean, "yay"! :)
[09:30:54] <Krinkle> I didn't want it to be jquery core specific
[09:31:02] <mikesherov> sure, anything but yaySwarm
[09:31:02] <Krinkle> well, there is yayQuery
[09:31:11] <Krinkle> I thought you'd like it
[09:31:13] <Krinkle> :)
[09:31:15] <mikesherov> :-)
[09:31:22] <mikesherov> I love (hate) it
[09:31:26] <mikesherov> so next item?
[09:31:26] * gnarf shrugs
[09:31:26] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: "jQuery" is not core specific
[09:31:42] <Krinkle> I konw
[09:31:49] <Krinkle> I just hand't considered it
[09:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer we change it.
[09:32:08] <Krinkle> mikesherov: Or did I just uncover the dark secret of why yayQuery was shut down by the yayCIA?
[09:32:10] <Krinkle> :P
[09:32:13] * Krinkle changes it
[09:32:27] <mikesherov> great!
[09:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you want to have a PR review meeting?
[09:33:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I've added an item for selectmenu bloew dialog and progressbar. Seems like it belongs there.
[09:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> I think that came up in a metting that I wasn't able to attend.
[09:33:44] <mikesherov> Yeah, I do, actually. I think there's just some cruft we can land or close
[09:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'm back to a normal schedule, so we should be able to meet now :-)
[09:34:13] <Krinkle> mikesherov: One thing I tried to prevent also is confusing between a product and a website. "jQuery Swarm" (which is what I've changed it into just now) sounds a bit like a product
[09:34:26] <Krinkle> (like jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile, jQuery ..)
[09:34:37] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: "jQuery's TestSwarm"?
[09:34:49] <Krinkle> though I guess that's just getting used to (same for .. Blog, ... Docs, ... Podcast)
[09:34:59] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: now as in right now, or now as in after the rest of the meeting?
[09:35:04] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: cute :D
[09:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I meant now as in a general sense, but I can do after this meeting.
[09:36:08] <mikesherov> k, I would prefer a night thing, but that makes it impossible for jzaefferer
[09:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> Night time works for me.
[09:36:22] <gnarf> I could do some PR reviews until my infra meeting too if I won't be too much of a shed influence
[09:36:32] <mikesherov> gnarf: we NEED YOU
[09:36:54] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: nevermind me
[09:36:58] <mikesherov> I have a meeting at 2:30 so I can do PR review now
[09:37:09] <mikesherov> let's wrap a bow on this meeting first
[09:37:24] <kborchers> I could poke through PR's with you guys but probably not available till later this afternoon so don't wait for me if you can do before
[09:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov, Dave_Stein and I had a meeting last night to go over draggable API redesign.
[09:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> The new API is on the planning wiki
[09:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137878/Draggable
[09:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> The one big thing we decided was to drop distance and delay.
[09:38:18] <scott_gonzalez> We couldn't think of any cases where they actually made sense.
[09:38:23] <kborchers> +9001
[09:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to prevent accidental dragging, you should use handle or cancel.
[09:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> Or implement something like snap.
[09:38:40] <kborchers> always wondered why we had those
[09:39:06] <jzaefferer> Nice
[09:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing I ever heard from Paul was "it prevents accidental drags"
[09:39:26] <mikesherov> The other big thing is that we deprecated a ton of the options
[09:39:38] <mikesherov> but are given them backCompat for 2.0
[09:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:40:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: meh, your points about handle or cancel addresses that
[09:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:40:35] <mikesherov> so we can continue to fix bugs and build an awesome test suite, prove the new API works for those use cases, provide code for people if they ever want them themselves, and to give an easy upgrade path off the old shittiness
[09:41:00] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to selectmenu.
[09:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> Hans did a review and found some accessibility problems.
[09:41:57] <scott_gonzalez> Going to investigate using a live-region hack to announce the items like we do for autocomplete.
[09:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Anything else to mention for selectmenu?
[09:42:33] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: Felix wants to land selectmenu in 1.10 as much as we do
[09:42:44] <jzaefferer> He's going to work through the remaining smallish code cleanup issues
[09:43:07] <jzaefferer> That's all I have there
[09:43:10] <mikesherov> brb in a few
[09:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> So, regarding selectmenu in 1.10...
[09:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get the beta out next week.
[09:44:41] <kborchers> isn't there a lot to do to get selectmenu in for the beta next week
[09:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> And selectmenu obviously isn't ready to land in master.
[09:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> So I'd like to go ahead with 1.10 without selectmenu.
[09:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> 1.11 can be released as soon as slectmenu is ready as far as I'm concerned.
[09:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> Our releases can be really small.
[09:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> If we do it that quickly though, I'd like to keep anything deprecated in 1.10 in until 1.12.
[09:46:30] <kborchers> i would like it if we could try to get selectmenu and menubar in the same release (1.11). i just think it would be nice to release them together being built on menu but not absolutely necessary
[09:46:53] <scott_gonzalez> makes sense
[09:47:14] <jzaefferer> Menubar is still a big steaming pile...
[09:47:27] <kborchers> i could jump on that really soon though
[09:47:36] <jzaefferer> I'd release selectmenu once its ready, then push for menubar and a good popup widget
[09:48:05] <kborchers> that would make sense too since i think menubar using popup would make sense but that's another discussion
[09:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> So are we good with bumping selectmenu to 1.11 and redefining what's in 1.11?
[09:51:05] <kborchers> i think so
[09:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ?
[09:52:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yeah, I guess. As long as that's not final until we actually release the 1.10 beta
[09:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Ok, but I plan on doing that next week.
[09:53:14] <jzaefferer> right
[09:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so I think that's everything.
[09:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> anyone have anything else?
[09:57:04] <tj_vantoll> fyi I made this in case anyone is looking to create a quick test case http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/Qp39S/show/
[09:58:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, tj_vantoll's fiddle is really nice.
[09:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> You could also add a textarea for the git builds.
[09:59:33] <tj_vantoll> Will do.
[09:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> Also, in case people haven't seen, we now have http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-1-9-git.js
[10:00:36] <scott_gonzalez> OK, let's continue in -dev.
[10:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[11:01:20] <gnarf> infra meeting - if anyone is around
[11:01:25] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: says he's got a work thing
