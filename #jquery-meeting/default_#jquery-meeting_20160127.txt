[12:04:56] <fnagel> hey
[12:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> We finally announced the beta!
[12:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2016/01/jquery-ui-1-12-0-beta-1/
[12:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks to jzaefferer for fixing the quick download generation.
[12:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Anything to discuss for datepicker?
[12:08:44] <fnagel> Nope
[12:09:13] <jzaefferer> hello
[12:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm back to looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1548
[12:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> But I honestly don't know if we're handling this right.
[12:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to see if I can get a discussion going in #accessibility on Mozilla IRC after this meeting.
[12:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> I tried earlier, but a lot of them are in meetings/eating lunch.
[12:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> Can anyone think of a native equivalent to this?
[12:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> The best I've come up with is dragging a window.
[12:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> And that never moves focus.
[12:10:48] <jzaefferer> I have to read the whole thing again, its been too long
[12:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> There are a lot of specific scenarios that have been given in the past via bug reports.
[12:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> But the whole thing boils down to: When mousing down on a draggable (or any other mouse-based element), should focus ever move, and if so, when and where?
[12:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> #12472 (the ticket that the PR is supposed to fix) is specifically requesting that mousing down on a draggable handle *should* blur the active element when it's unrelated to the draggable.
[12:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not sure when that scenario would occur outside of a web page.
[12:13:53] <scott_gonzalez> Or even within a web page using only native controls.
[12:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to find precedence for the behavior.
[12:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[13:02:20] <agcolom> zz_AurelioDeRosa, kswedberg, arthurvr,
[13:02:32] <agcolom> good evening everyone! Meeting time :-)
[13:02:34] <arthurvr> Hey-hey!
[13:03:00] <agcolom> and happy new year! since it's our 1st meeting in 2016 (and we're still in Jan :-) )
[13:03:04] <agcolom> Hey Arthur!!!!!
[13:03:09] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[13:04:03] <arthurvr> Are we alone here today?
[13:04:12] <agcolom> looks like it....
[13:04:45] <agcolom> It would have been nice to discuss/approve https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/877
[13:04:58] <arthurvr> Yeah.
[13:05:49] <arthurvr> about api.jquery.com, we’ll have to actually make every file tab indented before landing this, I guess?
[13:05:57] <arthurvr> A bunch of stuff isn’t atm
[13:06:03] <arthurvr> like https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries/attribute-contains-word-selector.xml and a bunch of other entries
[13:06:14] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: if you're still around, are you happy with https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/877 ?
[13:06:38] <agcolom> arthurvr: oh, yes.
[13:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> A few small things.
[13:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'll comment on the PR.
[13:07:21] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sure, that would be great, thank you
[13:07:33] <arthurvr> Yeah let’s discuss it there :)
[13:07:45] <agcolom> arthurvr: can these be fixed afterwards? (entries with spaces?)
[13:08:29] <agcolom> or will having the .editorconfig file cause issues?
[13:09:07] <arthurvr> I don’t think it’s really gonna be a problem, but it seems like something that should happen at the same time.
[13:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> The files should be fixed.
[13:09:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: at the same time or can this be done afterwards?
[13:10:02] <arthurvr> It might be annoying when your editor switches to tabs automatically and you don’t want unrelated edits in a specific commit, so I think it’s better to fix those files right away.
[13:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise you'll end up with commits that mix indentation fixes (automatic by the editor) and actual changes.
[13:10:17] <agcolom> right, ok, that's what I was wondering
[13:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's a tool to fix indentation automatically from an editorconfig file.
[13:10:50] <agcolom> so it's a manual process?
[13:11:20] <agcolom> as you normally would?
[13:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well, TBH, I've had mixed results with editorconfig.
[13:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how effective this actually is.
[13:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm all for tooling to solve annoying problem like this.
[13:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> But it's getting out of hand.
[13:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> But I digress...
[13:12:26] <agcolom> so I was wondering whether we could just have the editorconfig file available for whoever wants to use it but we don't have to?
[13:12:40] <agcolom> or if we have it in, we have to use it?
[13:13:31] <arthurvr> If someone has the editorconfig plugin it seems to me that it’s their intention to actually use it. If people don’t have the plugin it won’t apply anyway.
[13:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's up to every individual contributor to use an editor that supports editorconfig (plus to install and enable the support).
[13:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> To clarify, this is very different from things like JSHint and JSCS.
[13:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> There is no editorconfig task that can be run to find or fix mistakes.
[13:14:27] <agcolom> right. So my inderstanding is we're offering the file so that XO can contribute
[13:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> You have to actually go through your editor.
[13:14:58] <agcolom> and whoever else that has the same issue and a requirement for this file
[13:15:43] <agcolom> so I can still carry on as normal and make my indetations manually, and fix spaces to tabs manually?
[13:15:54] <agcolom> Is this correct?
[13:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> The real issue is that this particular contributor has bad settings in their editor.
[13:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> But this will fix their problem.
[13:17:32] <agcolom> perfect. Ok, so actually all this can be done directly by changing settings in the editor?
[13:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> But I can tell you that this particular contributor will not do anything without the editorconfig file.
[13:17:59] <agcolom> just like you or kswedberg changed my editor to remove trailing spaces
[13:18:12] <agcolom> yes,
[13:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> Getting back to the PR, kswedberg's comment seems unaddressed.
[13:19:12] <agcolom> so I understand the issues about us having spaces in place sometimes and having to fix that. However, I don't see why it's important to fix this before we make the editorconfig avaialble
[13:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> But don't let me hold this up. I don't work on this repo.
[13:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> And there's not a whole lot of consensus across projects anymore.
[13:20:47] <agcolom> Your view is important
[13:21:00] <agcolom> so we could specify all file types to use tab?
[13:21:12] <arthurvr> yes I think so
[13:21:36] <agcolom> except *.yml
[13:21:42] <agcolom> and package.json
[13:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> Right, except for *.yml and package.json
[13:22:09] <agcolom> cool. Thanks a lot.
[13:23:05] <agcolom> It's in the notes :-)
[13:24:49] <agcolom> ok, next item: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/530
[13:24:51] <arthurvr> Thanks!
[13:24:57] <arthurvr> Oh yeah that issue.
[13:25:05] <arthurvr> It’s probably more something we should ask the core team.
[13:25:14] <agcolom> Maybe we could ask timmy
[13:26:01] <arthurvr> I’ll see if I can attend the core meeting monday and ask them
[13:26:46] <arthurvr> or simply ping the ticket again
[13:26:59] <agcolom> thanks, yes, I have lost Timmy's handle on irc...
[13:27:03] <agcolom> timmywil?
[13:27:03] <arthurvr> ah, thanks :)
[13:28:10] <agcolom> next item
[13:28:10] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/854
[13:28:31] <arthurvr> so this comment: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/854#issuecomment-167775764
[13:28:33] <agcolom> I think it's pretty clear: If you've already signed our CLA, it's possible your git author information doesn't match your CLA signature (both your name and email have to match), for more information, check the status of your CLA check.
[13:28:55] <arthurvr> Sure but I wonder if it can be made more specific about the issue with the name/email
[13:29:02] <arthurvr> people sometimes don’t realise what exactly is wrong
[13:29:30] <arthurvr> I still have to make that kind of comments often
[13:29:39] <agcolom> you mean we should say first name and last name as well as your email address
[13:30:09] <agcolom> ?
[13:31:02] <arthurvr> I was thinking in the line of simply adding things like ”you’re mail doesn’t look like a normal mail address” or ”your git commit author information doesn’t contain a last name”
[13:31:36] <arthurvr> Might make things more clear
[13:32:04] <agcolom> so you mean give an automatic specific error message?
[13:32:14] <arthurvr> yeah
[13:32:44] <arthurvr> not a big deal though
[13:32:45] <agcolom> but if they enter jsut one name, we don't know whether this is their first or last name?
[13:32:47] <arthurvr> I simply thought it might save some time
[13:33:47] <arthurvr> or something like ”The git commit author information doesn’t contain two valid names (first and last name are required)”
[13:34:23] <arthurvr> might help pointing out the issue for people when they don’t see what’s wrong
[13:34:43] <agcolom> yes, but I wonder whether this is the case everywhere in the world... (I seem to remember something about this but I am not sure....) I'll have to double check, maybe Scott would remember...
[13:35:09] <arthurvr> ah yeah there’s https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues/54
[13:35:48] <arthurvr> I forgot about it for a moment too
[13:36:15] <agcolom> no worries :-)
[13:36:18] <arthurvr> still I wonder whether it can be made more clear in general, people seem to have troubles still
[13:36:51] <agcolom> sure
[13:37:19] <arthurvr> I’ll look into it next time I see an issue with troubles and see if I can come up with more concrete suggestions
[13:37:45] <agcolom> yes, that would be great
[13:38:42] <arthurvr> alright :)
[13:39:43] <agcolom> finally https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/690
[13:39:49] <arthurvr> Yeah
[13:40:02] <arthurvr> I was wondering if anyone had seen this strange behaviour before?
[13:41:26] <agcolom> I haven't noticed but I tend to type the urls
[13:41:41] <agcolom> thanks for the comment :-)
[13:42:12] <arthurvr> Yeah, I just pinged the opener again. Let’s see and otherwise I’ll just forward that conversation to the infra or the wp-content repo.
[13:42:24] <agcolom> sure, sounds good :-)
[13:42:37] <agcolom> I've added your comment in the notes
[13:43:04] <agcolom> I don't have anymore comments
[13:43:12] <agcolom> any other issues?
[13:43:20] <arthurvr> not from me at least
[13:43:40] <agcolom> I just wanted to say huge thanks as well to Aurelio for his crazy work recently :-)
[13:44:13] <agcolom> but he's not here to hear it ;-)
[13:44:26] <arthurvr> Yeah, amazing work! Thanks! :)
[13:44:38] <agcolom> ok, thanks a lot for everything arthur and the agenda!
[13:45:26] <agcolom> ok, I think this is it for today and see you in 2 weeks!
[13:45:30] <arthurvr> Have a nice evening! :)
[13:45:36] <agcolom> thanks, you too!
