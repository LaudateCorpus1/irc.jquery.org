[09:09:23] <kborchers> :)
[09:09:40] <gnarf> kborchers: meet you @ starved rock? :)
[09:09:58] <kborchers> heh ... to busy punching Cordova (phonegap) in the face right now
[09:10:23] <gnarf> So anyway... https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArIM4UVbwE-3dFg1T0k4VlE1bF82Nm9tbW90cVNxN0E#gid=14
[09:10:27] <rworth> ok, gnarf let's start with infra
[09:10:36] <rworth> just added the sheet for today
[09:11:10] <gnarf> today I'm going to be working on the nginx proxies and potentially the "services" box
[09:11:29] <gnarf> after I figure out whatever the issue with color is
[09:13:36] <rworth> ok
[09:14:20] <rworth> JÃ¶rn got 1-8 docs ready in the 1-8 branch of api.jqueryui.com
[09:15:05] <rworth> any open issues on docs other than what's in the github issue queue?
[09:16:51] <rworth> the rest of these topics are brought over from last week. Any discussion on them or anything else?
[09:17:16] <gnarf> Nope, I should be solving color today
[09:17:26] <kborchers> rworth: only thing i have is availability :)
[09:17:42] <gnarf> also, jquery-git shit is being built by jenkins now
[09:17:43] <rworth> kborchers yeah, let's talk after this
[09:17:49] <kborchers> ok
[09:18:14] <gnarf> kborchers: like availability you have time to help on other tasks? or don't? :)
[09:18:47] <kborchers> gnarf: i do have time ... believe rworth has some stuff for me
[09:18:52] <rworth> indeed
[09:19:24] <rworth> ok, thanks all
[09:19:29] <gnarf> right-o - not sure if you have any interest in sysadmin shit, but dan & I could use some help with it as we reach this last mile haul
[09:19:51] <kborchers> gnarf: interest yes ... skill set, maybe not :)
[09:20:13] <gnarf> kborchers: fair enough - perhaps one of these days ;)
[09:20:45] <kborchers> i would like to dive into that stuff at some point ... maybe when it's a little calmer we can go through some stuff together
[09:21:13] <gnarf> sure, even another set of eyes maintaining it would be useful
[09:21:26] <gnarf> I'll add you to the infra repo so you can at least see whats happening :_)
[09:21:43] <kborchers> gnarf: sounds good, thanks
[09:23:09] <gnarf> heh
[09:23:14] <gnarf> I think you're already on it
[09:23:31] <kborchers> heh ... just need to actually start looking around then :)
[09:23:37] <gnarf> kborchers: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues?state=open :)
[09:23:51] <kborchers> gnarf: yep, i can see that :)
[09:23:58] <gnarf> alright then
[09:38:39] <gnarf> so - I'm pretty sure this much silence means we're done
[09:38:42] <gnarf> :)
[09:38:53] <gnarf> see you in -dev --- rworth can you mail out the status?
