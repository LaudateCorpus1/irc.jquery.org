[14:09:35] <kristyjy> Hello
[14:11:58] <kristyjy> *waves*
[14:12:02] <sfrisk> one sec, let me get the schedule
[14:12:13] <kristyjy> no hurry :)
[14:12:55] <nashvail> Hey
[14:13:07] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:14:52] <sfrisk> Agenda
[14:14:56] <sfrisk> okay first up, kristyjy
[14:15:07] <sfrisk> did you convert the table stuff to use 'default'?
[14:15:58] <kristyjy> Last week kinda went by fast... not sure what happened to my time. I'll do it this week. I'd really like to get tables wrapped up so I don't have it hanging over my head during my vacation :D
[14:19:25] <sfrisk> input is blocked by the normalize stuff
[14:19:32] <sfrisk> arschmitz, any progress on normalize?
[14:22:29] <sfrisk> okay, I guess he's not around
[14:26:44] <sfrisk> well then, nashvail I guess we're onto grids
[14:26:59] <nashvail> Yeah
[14:27:28] <nashvail> So I'll be creating a ticket with the demos you mentioned
[14:29:45] <sfrisk> okay sounds good
[14:29:53] <sfrisk> I would aim for a basic flexbox demo
[14:29:59] <sfrisk> for next week
[14:30:19] <nashvail> Sure
[14:30:22] <sfrisk> not necessarily alignment stuff, just a basic "here is a mobile/tablet/desktop resizing"
[14:30:30] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:30:51] <nashvail> Yes absolutely I'll be in touch if I get stuck
[14:34:48] <sfrisk> okay sounds good
[14:34:57] <sfrisk> my availability is gonna be iffy from thursday to sunday
[14:35:00] <sfrisk> because of that thing
[14:35:08] <sfrisk> but kristjy knows a bit about flexbox
[14:36:24] <nashvail> Alright I will be in the chassis channel so...
[14:36:42] <nashvail> Anyone free cab answer
[14:36:45] <kristyjy> sounds good
[14:37:42] <kristyjy> a great place to start is CSS tricks they have really good flex box articles
[14:38:09] <nashvail> Yeah Sarah linked me to some
[14:38:22] <kristyjy> awesome
[14:39:12] <sfrisk> okay, so if I'm not around, connect with kristy?

[14:39:59] <nashvail> Great!
[14:40:12] <nashvail> That sounds good
[14:40:19] <sfrisk> okay
[14:40:23] <sfrisk> I don't have anything else
[14:40:30] <sfrisk> and need to get back to work
