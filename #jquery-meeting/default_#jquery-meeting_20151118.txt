[12:00:59] <fnagel> hey
[12:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we have too much to discuss today.
[12:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Have you had a chance to look at the firstDay implementation for datepicker?
[12:05:20] <fnagel> Yes!
[12:05:23] <fnagel> I did make some progress regarding the firstDay cldr dependency (removed and replaced as Rafael sugggested) and started working on that Grunt task for compiling the cldr data.
[12:05:23] <fnagel> Here is a WIP branch: https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/commits/datepicker
[12:05:23] <fnagel> This is the main commit: https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/commit/1ad3388327e5b3fc45c57afe25e10f2b3505c6f1
[12:05:23] <fnagel> This removes about 5250 lines from the localization.js file :-D
[12:05:42] <fnagel> Demos are already working thanks to the help of Rafael and a quick bugfix, resulting in globalize#1.1.0-rc.6). I will push a PR as soon as the tests run with the new, compiled locales too.
[12:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> "This removes about 5250 lines" \o/
[12:07:07] <fnagel> :-D
[12:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> That's quite a diff :-)
[12:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> Not much to say about upgrade guide or docs.
[12:09:55] <jzaefferer> Is mikesherov_ around?
[12:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll continue working on them, but we've got enough done that it's no longer blocking the release.
[12:10:09] <jzaefferer> There was a bit of discussion about how to move forward with pointer events and rewriting draggable
[12:10:27] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611#issuecomment-155854365
[12:11:07] <jzaefferer> if PEP worked in IE8, we could just land this for 1.12 :/
[12:11:15] <jzaefferer> or we dropped IE8 in 1.12...
[12:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> We'll wait for 1.13.
[12:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> The 1.13 release should be MUCH faster than 1.12.
[12:12:53] <jzaefferer> so can we land "this", more or less, and leave the draggable rewrite for later?
[12:13:14] <jzaefferer> there's still plenty of work to make the testsuites work on mobile devices
[12:14:21] <jzaefferer> would be good to have a rough consensus there, so that whatever time Mike can invest, is spent well
[12:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> We need to figure out if we're going to bundle PEP in the standard build.
[12:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> I thought landing pointerevent support prior to the rewrite has been the plan for a while.
[12:15:34] <jzaefferer> I thought so too, but apparently Mike didn't get that? "Ideally, we'd rewrite draggable before jamming PEP in there."
[12:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why we'd have to wait.
[12:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, I thought the proposal originally came from MIke.
[12:16:55] <jzaefferer> Can you comment on the PR? That should help clarify the matter
[12:17:08] <jzaefferer> I added another item to the todo list, about bundling PEP
[12:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> Comment added.
[12:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> I think that brings us to panel/paneset.
[12:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/11/panels-and-panel-sets.html
[12:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> s/paneset/panelset/
[12:19:29] <b-ot> Correction, <scott_gonzalez> I think that brings us to panel/panelset.
[12:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> whoa, when did b-ot start doing that?
[12:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz and I both provided some feedback.
[12:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> Neither of us were interested in pushing for the new elements.
[12:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> The two big reasons are that complex elements and shadow DOM aren't all that wonderful to work with.
[12:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> And the widgets they're trying to represent with the same markup are actually fairly different.
[12:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
[13:01:53] <agcolom> zz_AurelioDb: kswedberg: good evening, afternoon :-)
[13:01:56] <agcolom> meeting time
[13:02:02] <kswedberg> hey agcolom

[13:02:25] <agcolom> I'm guessing it might be a short one...
[13:02:38] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[13:03:02] <agcolom> so I'd like to discuss https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/829
[13:03:38] <agcolom> do you think we should replace the image or keep it with the fig and then add an iframe with the working example?
[13:04:22] <kswedberg> agcolom: I'm willing to go through the docs and add <figure> and <figcaption> elements for those images so we have something in place for iframe stuff
[13:04:41] <agcolom> oh, brilliant!
[13:04:54] <agcolom> Thank you that would be excellent!
[13:05:06] <kswedberg> I might need a reminder, but I'll try to do it this weekend.
