[12:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz awayrxaviers fnagel jzaefferer KidSysco benjamin-albert-
[12:00:04] <fnagel> hey
[12:00:05] <arschmitz> hi
[12:00:23] <benjamin-albert->  Hi I'm Benjamin
[12:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:00:34] <benjamin-albert-> Glad I can attend today
[12:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> benjamin-albert- and KidSysco are the main developers for the month picker plugin: https://github.com/KidSysco/jquery-ui-month-picker/
[12:01:07] <benjamin-albert-> Can I start with some questions?
[12:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:02:09] <benjamin-albert-> So KidSysco noticed that you want to have support for the HTML 5 month input
[12:02:18] <benjamin-albert-> What do you have in mind?
[12:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> We don't actually want to support that inside datepicker itself.
[12:03:17] <benjamin-albert-> I agrre
[12:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> Supporting the HTML5 date types is something we want to support via extensions.
[12:03:38] <benjamin-albert-> You mean plugins (like ours)
[12:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally your month picker code would get pretty small.
[12:03:52] <benjamin-albert-> I would like that
[12:03:57] <benjamin-albert-> I feel it's to big right now
[12:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> Having the datepicker be a proper widget should help a lot.
[12:05:11] <benjamin-albert-> I also think so
[12:05:17] <arschmitz> yeah anything custom with date picker right now requires a lot of code but widget will make it much much easier
[12:05:51] <benjamin-albert-> Custom code in JS is something I can workaround press easily
[12:05:55] <benjamin-albert-> But custom CSS
[12:06:12] <benjamin-albert-> Is a huge problem because we support themes
[12:06:18] <arschmitz> Well by virtue of being a widget it will get and use the new classes option
[12:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> So, I'm looking at the month picker for the first time right now. It looks like a large portion of the code in datepicker would n't actually be used.
[12:06:29] <arschmitz> which should make css issues much easier to deal with also
[12:06:34] <benjamin-albert-> So I can just rewrite whatever CSS and classes I want
[12:07:02] <benjamin-albert-> This is why I got stuck with the transparent buttons
[12:07:22] <benjamin-albert-> I can't just use my own CSS because I want it to work in different themes
[12:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm curious what fnagel thinks about having the month picker extend datepicker vs. being a completely separate widget.
[12:07:40] <fnagel> Calendar and Datepicker already use the classes option
[12:08:13] <fnagel> I think an extension should be fine!
[12:08:22] <arschmitz> @fnagel your rewrite but not the released versions
[12:08:36] <fnagel> This might be a starting point how to extend: http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/demos/calendar/dropdown-month-year.html
[12:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> benjamin-albert- Do you want to continue with the month names as buttons display?
[12:08:56] <fnagel> arschmitz: you'r right, only in the datepicker branch
[12:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> vs. something like the Chrome rendering where individual months are rendered like a normal calendar?
[12:09:23] <benjamin-albert-> You mean make the calendar have month buttons?
[12:09:40] <benjamin-albert-> Calendar widget
[12:10:01] <fnagel> We might need to add some more extension points (methods to overwrite) but I think a usecase like benjamin-albert- has is exactly what would help to understand the needs
[12:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm asking about the month picker.
[12:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> Currently it displays a full year's worth of months in each render.
[12:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> Whereas Chrome shows one month per render.
[12:11:06] <fnagel> Yes, but the demo gives an idea how to get the month data (localizations) from the calendar widget
[12:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, just trying to get an idea of what functionality they'll need to override.
[12:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> With the current display, they'd be changing pretty much the entire rendering.
[12:12:43] <fnagel> true
[12:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> At that point, I'd wonder how much benefit they'd get from extending datepicker.
[12:13:47] <fnagel> Not sure if using the markup rendering should be reused -- more like adding a button / change events and utilizing the localization / time calculation (= Globalize)
[12:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> If the display were more like the Chrome display, then the extension would be really helpful.
[12:15:56] <benjamin-albert-> Other people have started by haking date picker to get month support. But we thought we can get something a lot better by starting from scratch with something specially designed fro months
[12:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds fine, I just don't think the datepicker rewrite is going to help you much.
[12:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> Other than maybe pointing you in the right direction for various parts.
[12:16:59] <benjamin-albert-> The main thing I need from this rewrite is the transparent buttons
[12:17:07] <benjamin-albert-> In the header
[12:17:14] <arschmitz> well thats nothing to do with datepicker
[12:17:20] <arschmitz> thats just a new feature for buttons
[12:17:33] <benjamin-albert-> Which date picker should also use
[12:17:55] <benjamin-albert-> (I think)
[12:19:04] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, I think it would look a bit better than what we have right now: http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/demos/datepicker/default.html
[12:19:44] <benjamin-albert-> I have a few small issues with http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/demos/datepicker/icon-trigger.html
[12:19:59] <benjamin-albert-> When I click in the textfield the calendar closes
[12:20:18] <arschmitz> benjamin-albert-: curious if it might be better / easier for your case to not use button widget at all and just do a css only button which we added in 1.12?
[12:21:13] <benjamin-albert-> Can I a transparent button which will look good in all themes
[12:21:16] <benjamin-albert-> Can I a transparent button which will look good in all themes?
[12:21:23] <scott_gonzalez> benjamin-albert- Looks like we have that problem even with the default demo.
[12:21:32] <scott_gonzalez> (The rewrite is still a WIP)
[12:21:45] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: I think a month picker extension could be used to extend our calendar widgt to be more like the chrome date picker but I agree that utilizing our markup generation makes no sense.
[12:22:46] <fnagel> Afair thats wanted behaviour (due to focus change), but I could be wrong
[12:23:30] <arschmitz> benjamin-albert-: we will support transparent buttons in 1.13 in 1.12 its going to be up to you to handle the css needed for that
[12:24:16] <benjamin-albert-> What do you mean by "handle the css needed for that"?
[12:24:27] <arschmitz> make a class add it to the button
[12:25:08] <benjamin-albert-> "make a class add it to the button" what kind of class?
[12:25:31] <arschmitz> like a css class that changes the styles you want ex removing border and background
[12:25:53] <benjamin-albert-> Got it
[12:26:11] <benjamin-albert-> Sounds good to me
[12:26:42] <arschmitz> benjamin-albert-: and in 1.12 you may not even want to use the widget unless you dynamically manage the icon or text
[12:26:55] <arschmitz> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/button/default.html
[12:27:05] <arschmitz> you can create a matching button with just css now
[12:28:14] <benjamin-albert-> So my homework is to try to create a transparent button with the CSS button?
[12:28:42] <arschmitz> benjamin-albert-: you can do it however works best for your use case in month picker
[12:29:34] <benjamin-albert-> OK. I'll get in touch if I have any issues with that
[12:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[12:29:55] <benjamin-albert-> What about supporting period partials?
[12:30:07] <benjamin-albert-> e.g. "+1y +7m"
[12:30:19] <benjamin-albert-> In the new Datepicker?
[12:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> That's a question for awayrxaviers, but he isn't around right now.
[12:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's a question of whether Globalize will support it.
[12:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Had you discussed this at all with him?
[12:31:28] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember us getting to that point in the new API yet.
[12:31:40] <fnagel> no, not that I remember
[12:31:52] <arschmitz> benjamin-albert-: so transparent button is super easy just playing real quick
[12:32:22] <fnagel> https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize/issues/205
[12:32:36] <fnagel> or better: https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize/issues/391
[12:32:53] <arschmitz> just make a class `.transparent-button { background-color: transparent; border-color: transparent; }` and you get what you want i think
[12:33:26] <benjamin-albert-> arschmit: can you put together an example (if it's not to much work)
[12:33:27] <arschmitz> still has proper hover / active / focus effects
[12:34:13] <fnagel> We could make use of that Globalize feature in Calendar / Datepicker, should be easy when it's there
[12:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: That's for generating a string from a duration.
[12:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> We need a date from a duration.
[12:36:39] <benjamin-albert-> I have some feedback about the button example in: http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/demos/datepicker/icon-trigger.html
[12:37:21] <benjamin-albert-> Can we make an autoOpen option instead of this allow open var thing
[12:37:34] <benjamin-albert-> And  call the open method in the click handler
[12:37:50] <arschmitz> benjamin-albert-: http://jsbin.com/ciyiweqodu/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:38:23] <arschmitz> also needed background-image: none; for old themes with a background image
[12:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> An autoOpen option would only exist to make a button option work.
[12:38:37] <benjamin-albert-> Yah
[12:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, by the way, one of the big reasons we removed the button is because of localization.
[12:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> We can't support the alt text using CLDR.
[12:40:47] <benjamin-albert-> I also understand that a button is something that the user will really want to customize
[12:41:04] <benjamin-albert-> Regardless of localization
[12:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, which requires a fair amount of options.
[12:42:45] <benjamin-albert-> Can you take a look at our button option: https://github.com/KidSysco/jquery-ui-month-picker/wiki/Button-Option
[12:43:04] <benjamin-albert-> It gives you all the customizing power in the world without having to maintain vars
[12:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> So if we had a button option that returned the element to use, that would eliminate most of the options.
[12:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that just leaves the logic for whether focus on the text field opens the datepicker.
[12:44:41] <benjamin-albert-> Yep
[12:45:11] <benjamin-albert-> It also allows make it easy to keep the button's disabled state consistent with the date picker's state
[12:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> That seems reasonable.
[12:46:46] <benjamin-albert-> Should we add that to the planning wiki?
[12:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:47:20] <benjamin-albert-> Do you want me to add it?
[12:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> sure :-)
[12:47:40] <fnagel> Just add a wiki comment, I will take care of everything elese
[12:47:52] <benjamin-albert-> Sounds good!
[12:48:04] <benjamin-albert-> I have to go to work now
[12:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> Alright. Thanks for joining us today.
[12:48:44] <benjamin-albert-> Great talking with everyone here. Thanks for all the help!
[12:49:11] <benjamin-albert-> I'm looking forward to contributing to the development of datepicker
[12:49:21] <benjamin-albert-> (And month picker)
[12:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:51:49] <arschmitz> im good
[12:51:55] <fnagel> I would like to talk about calendar ARIA / markup specs and Jons prosed changes
[12:52:18] <fnagel> https://github.com/jongund/jquery-ui-datepicker
[12:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:52:46] <fnagel> Looks good to me but I'm not sure about focus handling and the wiki specs are pretty chaotic
[12:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> You mean about keeping the focus on the input?
[12:53:38] <fnagel> I would like to start integrating his changes (at least the markup)
[12:53:45] <fnagel> no, what happens within the grid
[12:54:20] <fnagel> until now the only focus the grid wrapper, not the single day elements
[12:54:33] <fnagel> I'm not sure he want's me to change that or not
[12:57:15] <fnagel> Perhaps I should just start with changing the markup (which is not that hard and seems a good idea anyway), push that to a new "datepicker-aria" branch (so we have http://view.jqueryui.com available) and use this to discuss everything else with Jon
[12:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> I think he just wants the focus to stay on the input.
[12:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> And then we use CSS to manage the visual changes within the grid.
[12:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> Which we do now, we just move focus to the grid itself.
[13:00:20] <fnagel> Mhh, where do you see that?
[13:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind. I read this wrong.
[13:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> So focus stays on the input until the user presses a key, and then it moves into the grid.
[13:01:22] <fnagel> "Focus should be on the current date gridcell in the calendar grid after the dialog box opens"
[13:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> Where do you see that?
[13:02:08] <fnagel> Wiki
[13:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...is that copied from the ARIA doc?
[13:03:48] <fnagel> Yes, or placed within our old specs
[13:03:56] <fnagel> history of the wiki is not really helpful
[13:04:05] <fnagel> "Like other widgets, the date picker widget receives focus by tabbing into it. Once focus is received,focus is repositioned on today's date in a grid of days and weeks. A second tab will take the user out of the date picker widget. Focus initially is placed on today's date."
[13:04:47] <fnagel> but then, two lines later: "Left Arrow and Right Arrow: advances one day to the next, also in a continuum. Visually focus is moved from day to day and wraps from row to row in a grid of days and weeks."
[13:05:04] <fnagel> which sounds like "keep the focos on the grid wrapper, move visual focus only"
[13:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> "Focus initially is placed on today's date." seems wrong.
[13:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> Currently selected date would make more sense.
[13:05:18] <fnagel> after tabbing in
[13:05:25] <fnagel> yes
[13:05:30] <fnagel> you're right
[13:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's ask him about whether actual focus should be moving.
[13:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> I think the intent is clear though.
[13:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a question of whether actual focus is moving.
[13:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> So we have to ask about that, and then ask about "Keyboard focus should not move into the "grid" until the user presses "up" or "down" arrow keys while in the textbox." vs. "Once focus is received,focus is repositioned on today's date in a grid of days and weeks"
[13:08:06] <fnagel> More than that
[13:08:36] <fnagel> currently we have grid, prev and next button as tabbable items
[13:09:05] <fnagel> I think he wants us to move the focus within the grid, focusing the current day item -- which we don't do now
[13:12:28] <fnagel> Anyway, do you think I could start implementing the markup changes Jon proposed?
[13:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> We're over our time. Is there anything else to discuss quickly?
[13:17:23] <fnagel> I'm fine
[13:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get the release out soon. I just need to look into https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15188 and get the API site deploying properly.
[13:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, sounds like we're done.
[13:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[13:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Feel free to discuss stuff like this in #jqueryui-dev at any point. You don't have to wait for meetings.
[13:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> Meetings are just an organized way for us to make sure we're available.
[13:21:00] <fnagel> Acutally I know, but most of the time it's ok to wait for the next meeting
[13:21:11] <fnagel> but thanks for the offer
[13:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
