[12:07:33] <DaveMethvin> hey
[12:07:55] <DaveMethvin> markelog timmywil m_gol gibson042 etc
[12:08:05] <m_gol> ok, let's talk here
[12:08:16] <DaveMethvin> good catch on isNumeric m_gol
[12:08:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah that PR was sitting on my drive a while
[12:08:30] <DaveMethvin> i'll update
[12:08:34] <m_gol> I think this is the only case where this method threw?
[12:09:17] <m_gol> or maybe we should copy the code from 2.2.3, not 2.1.4? any particular reason why you copied 2.1.4?
[12:09:25] <DaveMethvin> nope
[12:09:31] <DaveMethvin> definitely should use 2.2.3
[12:09:58] <DaveMethvin> let's start an agenda
[12:10:39] <markelog> hey-hey
[12:10:44] <m_gol> k
[12:10:50] <markelog> timmy is out?
[12:11:11] <DaveMethvin> i guess, we hadn't heard from him
[12:11:22] <markelog> ok, probably late
[12:11:22] <DaveMethvin> the main thing is the show/hide docs i think
[12:11:35] <DaveMethvin> i got most of the migrate issues done
[12:11:43] <markelog> nicely done btw!
[12:11:47] <DaveMethvin> timmywil has one claimed but i can grab it
[12:12:00] <DaveMethvin> does that iframe test one look okay to everyone?
[12:12:29] <m_gol> markelog had one remark about JSHint which sounds valid
[12:12:30] <markelog> yeah, maybe only removing the jshint pragma would be cool
[12:12:35] <m_gol> apart from that, looks good to me
[12:12:36] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[12:12:49] <markelog> yeah, if we could attach those methods to qunit, we could do it later
[12:13:13] <m_gol> it'd be best to fix this one thing & land it so that we have an unbroken build :)
[12:13:15] <markelog> probably be a good thing to sweep it out, when we finish with 3.0
[12:13:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah, there could be some cleanup later
[12:13:46] <markelog> DaveMethvin: did you finish migrate ticket about show/hide?
[12:13:57] <DaveMethvin> no, haven't started that one
[12:14:06] <DaveMethvin> not really sure how to deal with the code for that
[12:14:22] <DaveMethvin> ideally we detect only the problem cases, fix them, and warn about them
[12:14:31] <DaveMethvin> but i wasn't familiar enough with the differences to know
[12:14:36] <markelog> yeah, that one is tough
[12:14:51] <markelog> but, probably wouldn't be possible to detect cases
[12:14:59] <DaveMethvin> i was afraid of that :)
[12:15:15] <markelog> since that would be just a behaviour change, with different result for all cases
[12:15:34] <DaveMethvin> people really don't like when they get warnings that may not be fixable, but they also don't like when things break and they don't know why
[12:15:42] <markelog> even for disconnected elems i think
[12:16:15] <markelog> we could just warn them about it on every call
[12:16:20] <m_gol> if we have to choose between warning even in correct cases or no warning at all I'd be for the former
[12:16:24] <markelog> it wouldn't be ideal, but...
[12:16:36] <DaveMethvin> where did gibson042 go?
[12:16:36] <m_gol> (this is about specific sub-features of the change, no a remark about everything)
[12:16:43] <DaveMethvin> he was in -dev and disappeared
[12:17:10] <markelog> people disappeare! I think i saw something like in some movie )
[12:17:33] <markelog> aliens or something
[12:17:35] <markelog> :)
[12:18:12] <DaveMethvin> zombies
[12:18:33] <DaveMethvin> well if you have some ideas on anything we can detect for show/hide that would be great
[12:18:43] <DaveMethvin> i just have a feeling that one will create some issues
[12:18:44] <leobalter> markelog: is there anything I can help on qunit?
[12:19:00] <DaveMethvin> i think we're good on qunit leo
[12:19:03] <markelog> i think we could warn on everything, but provide a flag maybe?
[12:19:09] <gibson042> I love it when my IRC client lies about being connected
[12:19:13] <DaveMethvin> haha
[12:19:17] <markelog> :)
[12:19:23] <gibson042> anyway
[12:19:25] <gibson042> here's a fun fact: we have _two_ definitions of `showHide` in the 2.2-stable branch, but we only use one
[12:19:32] <gibson042> so my progress in documenting show/hide differences had to restart when I discovered that
[12:19:35] <DaveMethvin> redundancy!
[12:19:44] <gibson042> but that writeup will be done today, and then I'll do my last core 3.0 blocker (probably tomorrow) and move on to putting show/hide in Migrate (probably Wednesday or Thursday)
[12:19:57] <DaveMethvin> ok great!
[12:20:05] <markelog> cool!
[12:21:03] <DaveMethvin> so, on jquery 3.0
[12:21:08] <DaveMethvin> 3 blockers
[12:21:27] <markelog> 2?
[12:21:29] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABlocker
[12:21:29] <m_gol> timmywil re-appeared on IRC
[12:21:36] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: is  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3029 really broken?
[12:21:40] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: hey!
[12:21:52] <gibson042> yes, it's really broken
[12:22:23] <markelog> m_gol: it is a ghost!
[12:22:28] <timmywil> oi
[12:22:37] <DaveMethvin> i guess if we don't consider when to be promise.all it's broken?
[12:22:56] <DaveMethvin> let's deprecate $.when :)
[12:23:04] <markelog> hah
[12:23:21] <DaveMethvin> i liked the idea of having two different methods and defining $.when to be the bastard child of the two gibson042
[12:23:30] <gibson042> that's the plan
[12:23:49] <gibson042> they'll be internal functions to start, but easy to expose (at which point $.when _should_ be deprecated)
[12:24:08] <markelog> oh, gush
[12:24:58] <DaveMethvin> so we did commit to how disc elements toggle so can we close that issue that's a blocker?
[12:25:28] <markelog> what is the issue?
[12:25:30] <timmywil> sorry I'm late. am sick
[12:25:41] <markelog> timmywil: get well!
[12:25:42] <DaveMethvin> ugh sorry timmywil
[12:25:52] <DaveMethvin> markelog: this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2863
[12:25:56] <markelog> thanks
[12:26:05] <markelog> oh, got it
[12:26:28] <markelog> yeah, we did
[12:26:34] <DaveMethvin> this one seems pretty serious but there's an easy fix if the guy will just let us fix and publish and update https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3010
[12:26:45] <DaveMethvin> an update
[12:26:55] <markelog> he didn't respond, right?
[12:27:12] <markelog> we can write a letter, we communicated like that before
[12:27:39] <m_gol> you mean a mail?
[12:27:47] <DaveMethvin> just trying again
[12:28:01] <markelog> no! I meant write an actual letter with the postman and stuff
[12:28:07] <DaveMethvin> not active on github for serveral months
[12:28:12] <markelog> yeah, of course an email :_
[12:28:13] <markelog> )
[12:29:23] <DaveMethvin> do you have an email addr for him?
[12:30:08] <markelog> now i'm hoping i'm not confusing him with somebody else, hm
[12:30:19] <markelog> yeah, presumably
[12:30:31] <m_gol> haha
[12:30:41] <DaveMethvin> might be in his commits, i haven't checked
[12:31:13] <timmywil> I say this one is good to go. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2863
[12:32:23] <markelog> timmywil: yeah, it is, gibson042 said he will do it during this week
[12:32:42] <timmywil> for easing, I think we can release rc, but I'd like to get a PR on the easing plugin before final, but it's disconcerting he hasn't responded to our pings.
[12:32:59] <markelog> so much work the Richard, wow
[12:33:08] <markelog> *for the
[12:33:13] <gibson042> yeah
[12:33:28] <DaveMethvin> everyone okay with taking the blocker off https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3010 ? I'll continue to work it
[12:33:35] <markelog> timmywil: we can write a letter
[12:33:36] <gibson042> that's what I get for show/hide/toggle _and_ Deferred
[12:34:06] <markelog> heh :), changes in the code are easy
[12:34:13] <timmywil> gibson042: you talk the talk then walk the walk
[12:34:19] <markelog> everything else, might not be
[12:34:30] <DaveMethvin> face it we are all writing too much code!
[12:36:03] <timmywil> migrate is looking pretty good
[12:36:17] <DaveMethvin> oh is there still a PR to land for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2863 ?
[12:36:36] <timmywil> oh, forgot I had a migrate ticket. Thanks for taking that DaveMethvin
[12:36:43] <DaveMethvin> sure np
[12:36:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yes
[12:36:54] <DaveMethvin> oh duh then
[12:37:36] <gibson042> any objection to landing it now? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3037
[12:37:48] <timmywil> not from me
[12:38:12] <m_gol> none
[12:38:31] <DaveMethvin> go fer it
[12:38:46] <markelog> i had a question there
[12:38:50] <markelog> but it is not important
[12:39:05] <markelog> just was surprised about it
[12:39:43] <gibson042> ah, right
[12:40:09] <markelog> would add more comments though :))
[12:40:26] <markelog> like here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3037/files#diff-f584c95a54f22b45ff73937ddd094f4dR57
[12:40:27] <gibson042> still?
[12:40:37] <timmywil> gibson042: You still up for #3029? I can take it if you want to focus on the upgrade guide/migrate.
[12:40:40] <markelog> we check for display = ""
[12:40:50] <markelog> but we do the same for isHiddenWithinTree
[12:40:56] <markelog> but not really
[12:41:06] <gibson042> yeah, 3029 will have a PR tomorrow
[12:41:10] <markelog> so that could be confusing a bit
[12:41:13] <timmywil> ok
[12:42:06] <markelog> this https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3037/files#diff-379e909bd75e27cd1a5c81356cb80a14R25
[12:42:11] <markelog> should be moved right?
[12:42:17] <markelog> to here - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3037/files#diff-379e909bd75e27cd1a5c81356cb80a14R30
[12:43:29] <gibson042> not really, the otherwise block applies to both but the contains clause is used to imply computed style
[12:43:51] <gibson042> I'll try rearranging, though
[12:44:21] <markelog> this bit
[12:44:24] <markelog> `elem.style.display === ""`
[12:44:28] <markelog> on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3037/files#diff-f584c95a54f22b45ff73937ddd094f4dR57
[12:44:32] <markelog> is still needed?
[12:44:47] <markelog> i remember it was
[12:44:57] <markelog> but now it looks like it isn't needed anymore
[12:45:18] <gibson042> I think it is still needed
[12:45:54] <gibson042> for inline display:none
[12:46:15] <gibson042> oh, which is already covered
[12:46:17] <markelog> okay, got it
[12:47:06] <gibson042> anyway
[12:47:08] <markelog> so, anyway, i would confirm and add a comment
[12:47:12] <gibson042> will do
[12:47:20] <markelog> otherwise - !
[12:47:42] <markelog> irc, doesn't support emoji right? :)
[12:48:53] <timmywil> good to end here?
[12:49:04] <m_gol> are we going to release 1.12.4?
[12:49:10] <markelog> weird that we hadn't much tests for it though
[12:49:26] <timmywil> m_gol: seems like we should given the regression
[12:49:32] <m_gol> yeah, I agree
[12:49:40] <timmywil> I've got a milestone up
[12:49:45] <m_gol> maybe we only need to release 1.12.4
[12:49:51] <timmywil> perhaps, yea
[12:49:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah, someone will prob find another one the day after :)
[12:50:00] <m_gol> but we can change the name of the milestone after a release if nothing pops out for 2.x
[12:50:09] <timmywil> sure
[12:50:31] <m_gol> at one point we'll have to drop 1.x/2.x
[12:50:44] <m_gol> but regressions from 1.11/2.1 sounds good to get fixed
[12:51:04] <m_gol> and we had lots of commits backported so I fear there may be more of them
[12:51:07] <timmywil> I know exactly what I did wrong too
[12:51:11] <timmywil> on that ticket
[12:51:18] <m_gol> :)
[12:51:45] <timmywil> alright, thanks all!
