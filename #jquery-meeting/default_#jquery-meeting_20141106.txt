[11:04:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: gseguin|away: jasperdegroot: cgack: agcolom: Meeting Time!
[11:04:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:04:43] <cgack> hi
[11:05:11] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:05:26] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: You too sorry
[11:06:32] <arschmitz> Ok lets get started
[11:06:56] <arschmitz> 1.4.5 has been release there were some deploy issues that made it land pretty late on friday
[11:07:17] <arschmitz> These should be fixed on the infra side now
[11:07:30] <arschmitz> there has been one minor regression reported
[11:07:39] <arschmitz> but its a single line of CSS to fix so no biggy
[11:08:24] <arschmitz> anything else related to 1.4?
[11:09:18] <gabriel_schulhof> No reason for a 1.4.6 so far, right?
[11:10:00] <arschmitz> right
[11:11:38] <arschmitz> ok so 1.5
[11:12:06] <arschmitz> all the button stuff is updated there are a few minor things but nothing that should hold any one back
[11:12:25] <jasperdegroot> yup, saw that
[11:12:29] <arschmitz> I am going to remove the theme extension
[11:12:31] <arschmitz> FYI
[11:12:39] <jasperdegroot> will continue with button-css
[11:12:42] <arschmitz> it would require css changes i dont want to make at this point
[11:14:10] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I got a lot of conflicts in files that I didn't touch while I was trying to rebase button-css
[11:14:28] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: is that because you fast forwarded ui-1-12 or something?
[11:14:43] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: No, I believe arschmitz rebased ui-1-12.
[11:14:43] <arschmitz> thats because you based your branch off master and then rebased in the changes it looks like
[11:14:56] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: I had the same problem when I tried to rebase the test-fixes branch on top of it.
[11:15:08] <arschmitz> if you base it on 1.12 to start with then you could just git pull --rebase origin ui-1-12
[11:15:30] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I see
[11:15:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's what I thought and I still got conflicts. It was weird.
[11:15:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I might've done something wrong.
[11:15:57] <jasperdegroot> yeah, same here
[11:16:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well conflicts could happen
[11:16:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've started a second branch on top of the rebase and I'm pulling each commit by hand.
[11:16:11] <arschmitz> still
[11:16:27] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I did exactly the same
[11:16:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you can cherry pick a range you know
[11:16:45] <arschmitz> git cherry-pick sha1..sha2
[11:16:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know, but I'd rather not. I have cherry-picked one commit from the old branch that worked.
[11:17:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I only had, like, 9 commits, so it's no big deal.
[11:17:10] <arschmitz> ok
[11:17:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Not complaining, just finding it strange.
[11:17:39] <jasperdegroot> anyway, I just mentioned it because maybe we can prevent it with future changes in the ui-1-12 branch
[11:18:26] <arschmitz> ok anyway classes is almost ready to land on master in UI
[11:18:51] <arschmitz> some very minor changes and then we are going potentially make it handle destroy automatically also
[11:19:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Have you looked into avoiding the removal of classes from divs which get removed anyway?
[11:19:28] <arschmitz> but not sure yet
[11:19:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it does not matter
[11:19:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you just check if its attached to the dom or not
[11:20:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, I guess you can check the immediate parent, so that shouldn't be expensive.
[11:21:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its faster to just document.body.contains( node )
[11:21:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What?! Than checking someVariable.parent()?
[11:21:19] <arschmitz> then check the parent fist
[11:21:54] <arschmitz> but thats a whole other conversation
[11:22:35] <gabriel_schulhof> I think even the native node[ 0 ].parentNode is available ...
[11:22:45] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyway. OK. Feasible. [âœ“]
[11:22:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you cant just check parent
[11:22:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but like i said thats a conversation for another time
[11:23:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. Just one last thing: If you detach a whole snippet and remove classes from an element inside the snippet, I don't think that's a big waste of time. It's probably lightning fast, even if it's superfluous, because it's detached.
[11:23:50] <arschmitz> so all the classes pr's should be ready to be updated and for a round of review
[11:24:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I'm still battling with the tests.
[11:24:15] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: lets talk about this in dev
[11:24:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, of course.
[11:24:33] <arschmitz> this is not something the whole team needs to talk about and its not even being workedo n yet
[11:24:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, right, sorry!
[11:26:02] <arschmitz> ok roadmap
[11:26:11] <arschmitz> https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/9591bfb59d879cb6a504
[11:26:29] <arschmitz> I need to know if everyone thinks these timeframes are reasonable and doable
[11:27:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Mousewheel?
[11:27:56] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mousewheel
[11:28:39] <arschmitz> https://twitter.com/jquery/status/526803614988525568
[11:28:39] <b-ot> arschmitz: @jquery: The jQuery Foundation has adopted @brandonaaron's mousewheel plugin: http://t.co/tFL8xNUxFn
[11:28:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[11:29:25] <gabriel_schulhof> We're getting all kinds of input-related code. At least two packages from two sources.
[11:29:48] <arschmitz> Pointer events we are just waiting on google to sign the CAA
[11:29:48] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and mousewheel seems highly desktop-centric ...
[11:29:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes so?
[11:30:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No, nothing ... just seems like we could be heading for a massive, event library. Just my limited vision.
[11:31:10] <gabriel_schulhof> I suppose mousewheel can (and should?) be built on top of pointer events?
[11:31:17] <arschmitz> no
[11:31:19] <arschmitz> and no
[11:31:27] <arschmitz> mousewheel is not a pointer
[11:31:51] <arschmitz> and these are just foundation projects not necessarily part of ui or mobile
[11:32:21] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:32:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the question here is the timeline
[11:33:09] <arschmitz> for mobile
[11:33:10] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: one release each quarter seems a lot to me
[11:33:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: well remember 1.5 will be done already essentially
[11:33:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but still.
[11:33:43] <arschmitz> so thats only actually making 3 releases
[11:33:47] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, I know
[11:33:58] <arschmitz> and that part is not really flexible
[11:34:01] <arschmitz> only whats in them
[11:34:15] <gabriel_schulhof> That's the scrum way.
[11:34:20] <jasperdegroot> I miss a few things in there.. panel rewrite, navigation rewrite
[11:34:32] <arschmitz> panel is in q3
[11:34:38] <arschmitz> navigation rewrite is not a single thing
[11:34:48] <jasperdegroot> ah, sorry, missed that
[11:34:49] <arschmitz> there are related tasks in all the quarters
[11:34:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess by Q3 we will have to have it in place.
[11:34:57] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:35:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Somewhere in there we need to untangle init.
[11:35:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Currently init, navigation, and transitions are all tangled up.
[11:35:50] <gabriel_schulhof> I suppose that fits under nav rewrite.
[11:36:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well q4 has transition module creation
[11:36:39] <arschmitz> init may get in there somewhere but hard to say this is pretty full already
[11:36:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ummm ... not seeing it. jQM's Q4?
[11:37:00] <arschmitz> Prototype JS based transition module
[11:37:04] <arschmitz> its the first thing
[11:37:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, there it is.
[11:37:35] <arschmitz> and notice that and pagecontainers is the only things in q4 really
[11:37:43] <arschmitz> since slider and flipswitch will come from ui
[11:37:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Have we decided whether transitions are page-specific things, or whether a transition can be applied to any element?
[11:37:51] <arschmitz> no
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> ok so anything anyone thinks needs to change on here?
[11:38:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I've never been good at estimating how long things will take, but nav seems like a mammoth task right now.
[11:38:59] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: will we do a new UI/Mobile theme for 2.0?
[11:39:26] <jasperdegroot> yeah, nav is big
[11:39:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: its the last thing in q3
[11:39:37] <arschmitz> 2 i mean
[11:40:18] <jasperdegroot> sorry, I really should read better
[11:41:17] <arschmitz> ok so anything anyone wants to see change on here?
[11:41:17] <jasperdegroot> ah right, I now see CSS fw 1.0 is planned for Q2
[11:42:38] <arschmitz> guess not
[11:42:39] <jasperdegroot> it would be nice if we can stick to this planning
[11:42:49] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: sorry, still looking
[11:42:52] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: this will not be public
[11:43:02] <arschmitz> this is only for foundation use
[11:43:07] <jasperdegroot> was also checking http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/
[11:43:16] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:43:22] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: it will not line up with that
[11:43:30] <arschmitz> there is a pr to update the roadmap
[11:43:35] <jasperdegroot> no I understand
[11:43:42] <arschmitz> and even that is actually already out of date
[11:43:46] <jasperdegroot> just checking if everything was covered
[11:44:06] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: well also remember this is not our full roadmap this is just the roadmap for 2015
[11:44:29] <arschmitz> and much of it is based on UI's
[11:45:12] <jasperdegroot> right, but our old roadmap contained things we wanted to do in 1.5-2.0
[11:45:30] <jasperdegroot> but maybe some things can wait until 2.1 or later
[11:46:21] <jasperdegroot> anyway, I don't see anything that should be changed
[11:46:59] <arschmitz> ok
[11:47:07] <arschmitz> Anything else anyone wants to talk about
[11:47:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Not here. Just gotta make my way through the tests before I can start moving the classes PRs forward.
[11:47:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: your pr should not have anything blocking it now
[11:48:40] <cgack> I think I'm good
[11:48:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, actually, that's the PR I'm having to cherry-pick one-by-one.
[11:49:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and other tests have broken - like, for instance, kitchensink ...
[11:49:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... which is responsible for making sure that widgets are created before pagecreate fires.
[11:49:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Something really weird happens when you include js/ from the tests.
[11:50:01] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyway ... I'm looking into it.
[11:51:49] <arschmitz> ok
[11:51:54] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[11:52:36] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back on -dev
