[09:01:05] <rxaviers> Hello
[09:01:07] <kborchers> beep
[09:01:56] <gnarf> hey
[09:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Let's start with any updates you have about download builder/AMD or CLDR.
[09:02:37] <rxaviers> Intense week on CLDR
[09:03:35] <rxaviers> I've worked on the foundations: CLDR manipulation
[09:03:42] <rxaviers> https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr
[09:04:20] <rxaviers> Now, Globalize can take benefit of it to implement its functions abstracting it like the below:
[09:04:35] <rxaviers> 	Globalize.load( enCaGregorian );
[09:04:35] <rxaviers> 	Globalize.load( likelySubtags );
[09:04:35] <rxaviers> 	Globalize.load( weekData );
[09:04:39] <rxaviers> 	Globalize.locale( "en" );
[09:05:06] <rxaviers> Globalize.format( date, "<pattern>" ) )
[09:05:30] <rxaviers> On format implementation, Im now able to use something like this
[09:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> So that CLDR module just handles parsing a path and resolving locales?
[09:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> And the Globalize builds on top of that to handle things like formatting?
[09:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> s/the/then/
[09:06:11] <rxaviers> ret = cldr.main([
[09:06:12] <rxaviers> 	"dates/calendars/gregorian/quarters",
[09:06:12] <rxaviers> 	chr === "Q" ? "format" : "stand-alone",
[09:06:12] <rxaviers> 	"short",
[09:06:12] <rxaviers> 	date.getMonth()
[09:06:12] <rxaviers> ]);
[09:06:26] <rxaviers> Exactly
[09:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:06:45] <rxaviers> And CLDR module also abstracts all the complexities of CLDR like
[09:06:47] <rxaviers> inheritance
[09:06:55] <rxaviers> and fallback to some default values
[09:07:11] <rxaviers> and also to breakdown the locale into subtag values like: territory, script
[09:07:21] <rxaviers> (which is used to fetch values)
[09:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:08:38] <jzaefferer> Do you have a rough estimate how far/complete those two efforts are? https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr and Globalize itself
[09:08:54] <jzaefferer> I currently have no idea if this will take another week, month or year...
[09:09:07] <rxaviers> I know sorry for the lack of feedback in here
[09:09:17] <rxaviers> I also had no idea. CLDR docs are complex
[09:09:27] <rxaviers> and some of the infos I took some time to ask the right person
[09:09:37] <jzaefferer> I mean, now that you've worked on it, can you make an estimate?
[09:09:39] <rxaviers> But, now it seems this foundation is solid for what we need
[09:09:49] <rxaviers> Now, I am being able to implement format really quickly
[09:10:17] <rxaviers> About Globalize, I think in a couple of days we'll have most of format done
[09:10:45] <rxaviers> One example of thigns CLDR is abstracting: https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr/blob/b0.1.1/src/supplemental.js
[09:10:46] <rxaviers> https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr/blob/b0.1.1/src/supplemental.js#L14
[09:11:01] <jzaefferer> Is that just formatting, and parsing is separate? Or does that include both?
[09:11:04] <rxaviers> supplemental.firstDay is an info needed for Globalize.format
[09:11:14] <rxaviers> Just formatting
[09:11:54] <jzaefferer> okay, cool
[09:12:04] <jzaefferer> a few more days for parsing then :-)
[09:12:35] <rxaviers> If you say so. lol
[09:12:52] <jzaefferer> Are you not a miracle worker?
[09:13:02] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:13:21] <rxaviers> Jorn, Im about to reply your comment (on the Globalize PR) as soon as I get this format() more complete
[09:14:19] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:14:22] <rxaviers> But, that's basically it.
[09:14:33] <rxaviers> We have tons of FIXMEs or TODOs in the code
[09:14:42] <jzaefferer> Do you have updates on download builder?
[09:14:43] <rxaviers> that I will remove as soon as I get answers for them
[09:14:58] <rxaviers> (some questions I still need to send to the group)
[09:15:03] <jzaefferer> Like about "3x slower for uncached builds. Looking into optimization techniques, probably requires upstream changes"
[09:15:16] <rxaviers> No updates. We had a timeout issue that I solved by restarting the server
[09:15:38] <rxaviers> I noticed some weirdness on the cache
[09:17:11] <jzaefferer> Well, when it happens again, hopefully we can extract some more info to prevent this
[09:17:57] <jzaefferer> I've been working on dialog tickets. With the help of TJ and Jasper we closed five as fixed so far. I've started implementing http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9101
[09:18:41] <jzaefferer> Seems simple, but currently I'm stick with the focus not happening. Not sure yet what's going on
[09:18:57] <jzaefferer> But that's all for dialog, I think
[09:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> We did have to go back to z-index shuffling.
[09:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> So that's a bummer. But at least we were able to fix the brokenness of moving elements in the DOM.
[09:20:00] <jzaefferer> Its still quite different compared to our previous approach
[09:20:16] <jzaefferer> Compared to the previous z-index shuffling
[09:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but it still requires setting CSS directly via JS.
[09:21:46] <jzaefferer> right
[09:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> TJ's in Bulgaria this week, but I have an update from him:
[09:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> "the widget extensions landed and I've been finishing up the method examples for the widget factory. I'll have that done by next week and then I'll dig back into datepicker."
[09:22:17] <jzaefferer> What's he doing in Bulgaria?
[09:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure.
[09:22:36] <scott_gonzalez> He sent me an email this morning.
[09:23:02] <jzaefferer> I've fixed the 1.9 git build: http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-1-9-git.js
[09:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:25:10] <jzaefferer> is codeorigin.jquery.com deployed from master? Or does it also need tags?
[09:25:20] <scott_gonzalez> Deployed from master.
[09:26:15] <jzaefferer> I see my change on http://codeorigin.jquery.com/ui/ - I guess http://code.jquery.com/ui/ is still cached
[09:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you have to wait a few minutes, just like the old CDN.
[09:26:40] <jzaefferer> k
[09:27:02] <jzaefferer> guess we're done here
[09:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
