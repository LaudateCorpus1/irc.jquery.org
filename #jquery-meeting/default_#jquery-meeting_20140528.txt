[09:01:02] <rxaviers> hey
[09:01:06] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:11] <petersendidit> hey
[09:01:36] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:41] <jacques_perrault> hello
[09:01:50] <jzaefferer> hallo
[09:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> There hasn't been too much noise about the beta.
[09:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> So that could be good (everything works) or bad (nobody's testing)...
[09:02:26] <jzaefferer> Less than beta.1 so far, which was a rather quiet afair already
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> I did get this: https://twitter.com/zestrax/status/471661084135661569
[09:02:44] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @zestrax: @scott_gonzalez cool the 1.11.0 beta works bug gone. Nice thanks
[09:03:06] <jzaefferer> That's something, whatever bug that was referring to
[09:03:20] <tj_vantoll_phone> Here now.
[09:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9315
[09:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> He had down graded from 1.10.3 to 1.10.2 because of that.
[09:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> So, do we wait for the ARIA issues with selectmenu to be figured out before 1.11.0 final or do we just go ahead and fix it whenever we have a solution?
[09:05:43] <arschmitz> would you say they make it impossible to use or just not as good as it should be?
[09:05:50] <jzaefferer> I've discussed selectmenu ARIA with fnagel today
[09:06:19] <jzaefferer> I've checked some old branch again, which didn't help and we're out of ideas besides contacting Dylan Barrell again
[09:06:36] <fnagel> I wrote an email to Dylan Barrell and asked for help
[09:06:57] <jzaefferer> I think things are okay in Firefox/NVDA (right, fnagel?), so we might as well go ahead and fix whenever we can
[09:07:30] <fnagel> No, no label announcement., but any fix we had broke something else in Safari / VoiceOver
[09:08:14] <jzaefferer> Its pretty broken in VoiceOver anyway, so I guess we should just land a fix to improve our primary target and hope for Dylan to come up with something better?
[09:08:27] <fnagel> Current state is far from perfect but works somehow consistent when I remember correctly
[09:09:10] <arschmitz> its silly how hard this is
[09:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of how hard this is...
[09:09:32] <fnagel> An its even more silly that we have to do this again once we try to implement a native menu option
[09:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> I told @wcagtest that I'd give them a list of how many ridiculous things we need to do for ARIA.
[09:10:41] <jzaefferer> Is there a punchline?
[09:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> If there is, I think we're the butt of the joke.
[09:11:54] <fnagel> jzaefferer: "Its pretty broken in VoiceOver anyway" - I thought its working a little in VoiceOver and a little better in NVDA
[09:12:54] <jzaefferer> fnagel: there are no announcements in VoiceOver when changing the value; the only way I could get it to announce in that case was to add "aria-live": "assertive" to the button, which then ends up reading the value three times on each change
[09:13:53] <fnagel> jzaefferer: That was the case in every version we came up with lately?
[09:17:42] <jzaefferer> Yeah, I think so
[09:18:33] <jzaefferer> Anyway, I don't think this should hold up the 1.11 release. It still works much better then any other select-replacement like Chosen, which doesn't do ARIA at all
[09:19:11] <jzaefferer> Hardly a high standard to look up to (more like looking down), but hey, there's only so much we can do
[09:19:36] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sounds reasonable
[09:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> We can ping Bryan Garaventa for ideas too.
[09:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> Let's see what Dylan says first.
[09:20:51] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: wrote him an hour ago
[09:21:26] <arschmitz> i can try and email Victor Tsaran he used to help on mobile a lot
[09:21:31] <arschmitz> if you guys want
[09:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be good.
[09:22:11] <arschmitz> ok
[09:23:27] <jzaefferer> Is he still at PayPal?
[09:23:44] <arschmitz> yes
[09:28:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: anything on Globalize?
[09:28:48] <rxaviers> I have landed number parsing
[09:29:20] <rxaviers> and released a new alpha, so our last updates are available on npm/bower easily for users
[09:29:41] <jzaefferer> Getting the published version on repo readme in sync again
[09:29:56] <jzaefferer> What's next?
[09:30:01] <rxaviers> other than number parsing, Globalize instances is the other feature available on 1.0.0-alpha.3
[09:30:44] <jzaefferer> What's next on the Globalize roadmap?
[09:30:46] <rxaviers> I've marked https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues?milestone=1&state=open
[09:30:56] <rxaviers> for 1.0.0 milestone
[09:31:08] <jzaefferer> Ah, nice
[09:31:16] <rxaviers> not sure whether or not we should wait/include the polyfil. But, I have added it to it
[09:31:29] <jzaefferer> added? To the ticket?
[09:31:44] <rxaviers> added to the milestone 1.0.0
[09:32:15] <rxaviers> ah! I need to add the test automation issue to 1.0.0
[09:32:21] <jzaefferer> Any progress on testing with browserstack-runner?
[09:32:35] <rxaviers> haven't touched that since your last comment
[09:32:48] <jzaefferer> As long as we run our tests in IE8, the actual implementation isn't that important
[09:33:17] <rxaviers> manually using browserstack?
[09:33:25] <jzaefferer> Error handling seems good to have in that milestone, since we don't really want to introduce throwing exceptions later
[09:33:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: im going to open a few issues on the browserstack-runner repo
[09:33:49] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: manually as in running the tool on the CLI
[09:34:19] <rxaviers> never used it. But, ok
[09:34:29] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay; if they don't respond, I can ping people
[09:34:35] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: iv been trying it with both jquery-mobile and playing with in in jquery-ui with little luck
[09:34:42] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I thought you tried to run browserstack-runner
[09:34:48] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its all the same errors in both
[09:35:03] <rxaviers> I thought you were mentioning an alternative to it, since it didnt work
[09:35:10] <rxaviers> :p
[09:35:28] <jzaefferer> It should work now
[09:35:39] <rxaviers> by now, you mean now today?
[09:36:27] <jzaefferer> since this landed a week ago: https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner/pull/83
[09:36:45] <rxaviers> Last time running it I got this
[09:36:45] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/235#issuecomment-44075943
[09:36:53] <rxaviers> 23/05
[09:37:05] <rxaviers> May 23th
[09:37:35] <jzaefferer> Let's get that reported to them
[09:37:45] <arschmitz> thats one of the ones i was going to report
[09:37:57] <jzaefferer> I guess we still have no solution to deal with checkbox focus outline?
[09:38:00] <arschmitz> alone with 2 similar ones
[09:38:08] <rxaviers> awesome arschmitz
[09:38:59] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the best thing i think we have come up with is to maybe try and copy some other browsers foucs outline and use that in places where we know the real one wont show
[09:39:26] <arschmitz> like maybe since chrome can be turned back on just pick chromes or something its really not a great solution
[09:40:26] <jzaefferer> I guess its worth a try, since we have nothing else
[09:40:52] <arschmitz> then that would get different focus out line in like firfox then other elements
[09:41:13] <jzaefferer> better then no focus indicator at all
[09:41:14] <arschmitz> but at least it shows and is something reasonable looking its just chromes but showing up in firefox lol
[09:41:22] <tj_vantoll> Another case where we have to pick the best of bad options :(
[09:41:26] <tj_vantoll> But I agree.
[09:41:40] <arschmitz> yeah its the best i can think of
[09:41:49] <arschmitz> iv really racked my brain
[09:42:20] <arschmitz> and tried tons of css tricks to like stretch the checkbox and use its ownline and be transparent or something
[09:42:41] <arschmitz> but nothing works every where and when it does not its HORRIBLE
[09:43:08] <arschmitz> like the little square checkbox shows up hovering over it
[09:43:34] <arschmitz> because some browsers wont let you change the style of that part
[09:45:02] <arschmitz> anyway ill implement that and we can see how it looks in different browsers
[09:46:14] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:46:29] <jzaefferer> I think that's all we have today
[09:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
