[10:04:07] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[10:04:14] <arschmitz> Hi
[10:04:17] <arthurvr> bonjour!
[10:04:29] <slayslot_> hi
[10:04:43] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:05:54] <noufal> hi
[10:06:21] <sfrisk> So, first up on the agenda today is marestad's Typography PR
[10:06:49] <sfrisk> I know it was discussed last meeting noufal that you would be helping out on that
[10:06:59] <sfrisk> Has any progress been made?
[10:07:16] <arschmitz> i dont think hes here he didnt respond to ping
[10:07:39] <arschmitz> and there are not new commits since before last weeks meeting
[10:07:42] <sfrisk> ping goes at his michaelarestad name, not marestad
[10:07:49] <arschmitz> ohhh yeah
[10:07:59] <arschmitz> PEOPLE STOP CHANGING YOUR NAMES!
[10:08:10] <arschmitz> :-)
[10:08:20] <sfrisk> It frustrates arschmitz
[10:08:27] <sfrisk> you do not want to frustrate arschmitz
[10:08:38] <arschmitz> also makes you not get pinged for meetings :-p
[10:08:41] <noufal> Sorry today I had a last exam. I will report tomorrow after disscussing with  marestad
[10:09:04] <sfrisk> You didn't talk after the meeting last week?
[10:10:03] <noufal> I ping marestad but marestad is busy.
[10:10:18] <sfrisk> hrm, okay
[10:10:42] <sfrisk> Well, we need to start moving ahead faster on stuff, since our goal is to have Phase One done in June
[10:11:02] <noufal> I will report u tomorrow.
[10:11:20] <sfrisk> So it might be wise to start working on some non typography items as much as we can
[10:11:44] <sfrisk> isaacdurazo - any update on logo stuff?
[10:13:39] <marestad> I'm here!
[10:13:50] <sfrisk> hey :-)
[10:14:03] <marestad> Sorry for the delay. Fire alarm.
[10:14:22] <sfrisk> that's frustrating :-/
[10:15:17] <arschmitz> marestad: so any progress on typography
[10:15:38] <sfrisk> I think the major concern right now is arschmitz' for native :focus
[10:15:46] <marestad> Just some local changes I've been messing with. Native focus will be restored.
[10:16:51] <arschmitz> marestad: yeah once focus is handled accessibly i think its good if i recall ( i have not looked since last week )
[10:17:39] <sfrisk> Okay, well when you have time, can you commit them?
[10:17:40] <noufal> We will give u progress in comming 2-3 days.
[10:17:48] <arschmitz> marestad: normalize.css is also on master now
[10:17:59] <marestad> Woo!
[10:18:01] <arschmitz> so you may want to rebase and build off that
[10:18:08] <marestad> Will do.
[10:18:17] <arschmitz> may change a pixel or 2 here and there with that in place
[10:18:33] <marestad> Shouldn't change much. I've been working off normalize.
[10:18:50] <sfrisk> Also, marestad, I updated the "create semantic color variable name" issue to include base color names
[10:19:01] <marestad> Cool.
[10:19:08] <marestad> Saw that.
[10:19:16] <arschmitz> marestad: ah ok well it could change what the rest of us see since its not in the preview since it was not in the commits
[10:19:28] <marestad> Got it.
[10:19:42] <marestad> I'll fix up a few more things and get it ready for merge.
[10:19:48] <sfrisk> I figured we could fill it in for now with colors in the logos that isaacdurazo designed
[10:19:54] <arschmitz> probably not a noticeable amount though pixel or 2 at most i would think
[10:20:05] <marestad> We can then create more PRs to tweak some of the other typography elements as we go as well as colors.
[10:20:24] <arschmitz> for sure
[10:20:39] <arschmitz> we just need basics in place to to build off
[10:20:45] <marestad> Yep.
[10:20:53] <sfrisk> Would it be easier for you to add in the colors one with your PR? Or I could set up a separate PR real quick for colors
[10:20:57] <sfrisk> so we can close out that issue
[10:21:16] <marestad> I'd rather have colors in a separate PR and add a color palette html page in demos.
[10:21:33] <arschmitz> yeah that seems sperate
[10:21:38] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll set up the PR for that then
[10:21:45] <marestad> Will involve some contrast checking and such.
[10:21:54] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:22:12] <arschmitz> i think i saw an automated task for that somewhere recently i need to look
[10:22:25] <sfrisk> I know of the website
[10:22:37] <arschmitz> yeah that wont check commit to commit though
[10:22:40] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:23:00] <arschmitz> https://github.com/globant-ui/arialinter
[10:23:55] <sfrisk> I'll create an issue for that
[10:24:03] <sfrisk> Assign it to you, arschmitz?
[10:24:06] <arschmitz> sure
[10:24:21] <arschmitz> im going to do some other grunt related stuff so i can do it at the same time
[10:25:15] <marestad> Rad.
[10:26:29] <sfrisk> Okay issue created and assigned to you
[10:26:36] <arschmitz>  thank you
[10:27:02] <sfrisk> Okay, so there has been a lot of discussion lately in the SCSS Style Guide and the HTML Style Guide
[10:27:51] <sfrisk> Does someone want to start a PR for one of these items based on rules that have been established thus far in the thread, and anything else that sounds important to include?
[10:28:21] <slayslot_> I could start a PR for the HTML style guide
[10:28:54] <sfrisk> Okay, do that in the contribute repo
[10:29:21] <slayslot_> sure thing
[10:29:53] <arschmitz> big priority for me in that pr
[10:29:53] <sfrisk> I can take the SCSS style guide
[10:30:00] <arschmitz> is a set of htmllint settings
[10:31:47] <sfrisk> did you make a note of that in the issue, arschmitz?
[10:31:56] <arschmitz> probably?
[10:32:24] <slayslot_> Should I add that to the list I created in the issue?
[10:32:26] <arschmitz> yup in november lol https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/92#issuecomment-62887139
[10:32:38] <sfrisk> Or add it in the PR
[10:33:03] <sfrisk> Take a look at the CSS or JavaScript style guide for an idea of what we're looking for in wording that
[10:33:20] <sfrisk> https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/css/
[10:33:24] <arschmitz> the js style guide is by far the most robust and up to date
[10:33:29] <sfrisk> http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/
[10:33:34] <arschmitz> that one is constantly revised for clarity
[10:33:45] <sfrisk> Yeah, I'm pretty much the one person who updates CSS
[10:33:57] <arschmitz> which reminds me i need to update all our js
[10:34:08] <arschmitz> the js style guide has a few changes
[10:34:13] <slayslot_> Alright, I'll add that to the PR.
[10:35:18] <sfrisk> I'll work on the SCSS one
[10:36:52] <sfrisk> Okay, so with Typography wrapping up, it's important to get work on the form elements soon
[10:37:03] <sfrisk> especially since we're trying to get the phase one stuff done by june
[10:38:17] <sfrisk> I updated some of the form related items today, including form validation style and input state
[10:38:39] <arschmitz> once we have something to test we need to get some form of perf ci going too
[10:38:41] <sfrisk> Also I'll be creating a separate issue for semantic buttons vs the base styling of html4 form elements
[10:39:02] <arschmitz> what do you mean?
[10:39:14] <sfrisk> buttons that have meaning based on class name
[10:39:23] <sfrisk> versus just a plain old button
[10:39:34] <sfrisk> Or I was considering it anyway
[10:39:40] <noufal> What is the deadline of phase 2?
[10:39:45] <arschmitz> can you give an example what you mean?
[10:40:04] <sfrisk> so basic html4 button types include reset, submit, button
[10:40:23] <arschmitz> ok
[10:40:25] <sfrisk> but if you look at something like bootstrap, for example
[10:40:39] <sfrisk> http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons-options
[10:41:01] <arschmitz> ok so heres my question
[10:41:10] <arschmitz> why do the states have anything to do with buttons
[10:41:14] <sfrisk> they have buttons that mean a bit more semantically
[10:41:20] <sfrisk> ... I'm not saying anything about states
[10:41:32] <arschmitz> since all they do is change the color
[10:41:41] <arschmitz> those are not semantic to buttons they are semantic to states
[10:41:43] <sfrisk> I'm saying having an issue that addresses the different
[10:41:52] <sfrisk> butotns
[10:41:54] <sfrisk> buttons*
[10:42:23] <sfrisk> if we want to include more than default button styling for reset/submit/button types
[10:42:44] <sfrisk> like button-default, button-primary, button-success, etc
[10:43:02] <arschmitz> right what im saying is i dont think those should have anything to do with buttons specificly
[10:43:12] <sfrisk> I don't know if that should be included or not with "Base styling for html4 form elements"
[10:43:20] <arschmitz> like success is a general state infact a success button makes little semantic sense
[10:43:33] <sfrisk> well like
[10:43:43] <sfrisk> button-delete, button-save, button-reset
[10:43:53] <arschmitz> those are icons
[10:43:59] <sfrisk> not always
[10:44:16] <sfrisk> I've worked on sites where a delete button vs a save button might just be a different color
[10:44:29] <arschmitz> you think we should have a special delete / save / reset style ?
[10:44:37] <arschmitz> that seems like a rabit hole
[10:44:54] <arschmitz> those are never ending like colors and very specific to your application
[10:45:02] <sfrisk> I'm suggesting that are there any button types that we want to account for
[10:45:05] <noufal> I think Sfrisk is right.
[10:45:44] <sfrisk> if no, that's fine, and they can make their own, but it might be helpful to have some various button options available to get things started quickly
[10:46:02] <noufal> yes
[10:46:16] <arschmitz> id say file an issue
[10:46:42] <sfrisk> it's more you just see more variety it what's going on with buttons than you do with other form elements
[10:46:43] <arschmitz> just my opinion is that that seems like a bad idea long term
[10:47:00] <arschmitz> but what im trying to get at with states is like this http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[10:47:02] <sfrisk> variety in*
[10:47:14] <arschmitz> if you scroll down to like highligh and error
[10:47:24] <arschmitz> those can be applied to any element not just a button
[10:47:46] <arschmitz> so we should talk about states as their own thing separate from buttons
[10:47:49] <noufal> one more suggestion. we we make a different style of button. we will mention who to change the color in docs. unlile bootstrap
[10:48:01] <noufal> how*
[10:48:08] <noufal> unlike*
[10:48:16] <arschmitz> noufal: trust me our docs will be good for stuff like that
[10:48:28] <noufal> good :)
[10:48:30] <arschmitz> i tore my hair out making the buttons for perf stuff for some frameworks
[10:48:51] <arschmitz> and saw what a pain bad docs is
[10:49:02] <noufal> hahaha
[10:49:26] <arschmitz> noufal: bootstrap are actually some of the best among css frameworks out there
[10:49:34] <arschmitz> but still far from perfect
[10:49:38] <noufal> I design different type of button. If u need any help I will help you
[10:50:42] <sfrisk> Anyway, I know in most CSS frameworks I've seen, they've offered a lot of variety in buttons beyond just a basic button.  It may be all we need is one basic button, but I would like to make it easy to have different ones
[10:50:46] <noufal> there are many thing which are not in bootstrap but I wish they will be there. But we will include this in chassis
[10:50:50] <sfrisk> and that could easily just tie into states
[10:51:12] <arschmitz> i think we should at least have in line and full width buttons
[10:51:47] <arschmitz> a few frameworks that are mobile first do this
[10:52:21] <sfrisk> part of me wants to at least offer a normal and a large size
[10:52:22] <arschmitz> and icon only
[10:52:30] <arschmitz> yeah sizes are cool
[10:52:35] <arschmitz> we do normal and mini in mobile
[10:53:22] <sfrisk> but yeah, in general I felt that buttons can get gnarly enough that keeping them separate from base styling might be good from a headache perspective
[10:54:02] <arschmitz> what do you mean keep them seperate in what way?
[10:54:23] <noufal> but button is very imp in styling. Styling a button is a headache
[10:54:42] <sfrisk> in issues
[10:54:58] <sfrisk> regular inputs covered in one issue, buttons covered in another
[10:54:59] <arschmitz> ah ok
[10:55:05] <arschmitz> yes
[10:55:17] <arschmitz> im strongly in favor of building a base button first
[10:56:04] <arschmitz> it tends to be a building block for everything else
[10:59:04] <sfrisk> so base button in HTML4 form elements, button variety in a separate button issue
[11:02:34] <sfrisk> Okay, that's about it, and it's 2 o'clock
[11:02:43] <sfrisk> I did update the validation styling issue too, as a heads up
[11:03:05] <sfrisk> to include the 3 types of validation I noticed being discussed thus far, as a sort of "definition of done" for the issue
[11:03:17] <sfrisk> as requirements are hammered out further through discussion I'll add more
[11:05:11] <sfrisk> so it's 2 o'clock
[11:05:17] <sfrisk> anyone have anything else they wanted to bring up?
[11:05:22] <arschmitz> nope
[11:05:31] <noufal> nope
[11:05:42] <slayslot_> no
[11:05:44] <sfrisk> Okay, this meeting is officially over, see you in #css-chassis
