[09:06:56] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin, addyosmani, rwaldron, gnarf, kswedberg etc
[09:07:00] <rwaldron> <
[09:07:06] <rwaldron> i meant... <3
[09:07:07] <kswedberg> hey
[09:07:09] <ajpiano> heh
[09:07:13] <ajpiano> did we end up doing a 1.6.2 rc?
[09:07:20] <DaveMethvin> announced it, yeah
[09:07:52] <DaveMethvin> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/06/14/jquery-162rc1-released/
[09:08:01] <ajpiano> derp.
[09:08:14] <DaveMethvin> seen a few good bugs come by and get squashed
[09:08:32] <ajpiano> reason enough to do rc2 ?
[09:08:39] <DaveMethvin> love rwaldron's commit ... begrudgingly lol
[09:08:46] <rwaldron> :D
[09:09:31] <DaveMethvin> on rc2, i'd like to get timmywil's input
[09:09:40] <DaveMethvin> what do you think rwaldron
[09:10:46] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin as far as readiness?
[09:11:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and whether the post-rc changes merit another go-round
[09:11:05] <ajpiano> well i'm just saying should we do another rc if there have been enough changes
[09:11:19] <DaveMethvin> remember this is a .2 release so it can't suck :P
[09:11:26] <ajpiano> haha
[09:11:59] <rwaldron> I feel like we had a smaller rc response then i am used to
[09:12:10] <rwaldron> w/r to filings
[09:12:24] <DaveMethvin> let's hope that means there wasn't too much wrong
[09:12:41] <addyosmani> don't appear to have been a huge number of changes since the rc1 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/master/
[09:13:04] <ajpiano> rwaldron: that's kind of the vibe i got too
[09:13:22] <rwaldron> It's odd, I don't really know what to make of it
[09:13:29] <rwaldron> does it mean that less testing happened?
[09:13:34] <rwaldron> was there less awareness?
[09:13:52] <rwaldron> or did the same amount of testing happen and it was just really good?
[09:14:02] <ajpiano> who knows, i think it's typically a low-turnout affair
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> so hard to get ppl interested in pre-release testing
[09:14:08] <rwaldron> I also cant shake a nasty feeling
[09:14:32] <ajpiano> that?
[09:14:32] <DaveMethvin> so i guess we
[09:14:32] <rwaldron> I think scott_gonzalez and the UI team is having a bummer of a time with attr/prop changes
[09:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> it's true
[09:14:40] <ajpiano> rwaldron: that is true
[09:15:02] <rwaldron> And I feel like we could be doing more to make that less crummy
[09:15:04] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: are there particular things that could be changed to make it easier?
[09:15:07] <rwaldron> but I don't know what
[09:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: not sure yet, I need to talk through it with someone that knows what's going on
[09:15:23] <jaubourg> ... late
[09:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> but I'm gonna be on vacation for most of this week
[09:15:41] <addyosmani> It's hardly a gauge of interest levels, but we haven't had as many/any comments about breakage on the release post as on previous releases. Short of the tickets that came through one might say we're in a good position, but blergh.
[09:15:45] <addyosmani> hey jaubourg
[09:15:56] <jaubourg> hey addy
[09:16:23] <rwaldron> hey jaubourg <3
[09:16:58] <jaubourg> hey rick :)
[09:17:00] <DaveMethvin> it seems like 1.6.2 may be in good shape then? other than a peaceful queasy feeling?
[09:17:10] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin
[09:17:37] <ajpiano> oops
[09:17:43] <DaveMethvin> I KNOW YOU WON'T LET ME DOWN
[09:17:51] <ajpiano> another rc wouldn't hut
[09:18:01] <ajpiano> i guess we should see what john and timmy think
[09:18:04] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I knew you were a Depeche Mode fan! I knew it!
[09:18:12] <rwaldron> "peaceful queasy feeling"
[09:18:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin... pure genious
[09:18:25] <kswedberg> sounds like the Eagles to me.
[09:18:33] <rwaldron> EXACTLY
[09:18:34] <rwaldron> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44A9iDQNrss
[09:18:43] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: what do  these whippersnappers know?
[09:18:44] <ajpiano> hey so guys WRT to that bug triage sprint, the 6/7th is kinda tough for me - was thinking more like the 11th/12th ?
[09:18:53] <kswedberg> :)
[09:19:03] <rwaldron> ajpiano i'm ok for whatever
[09:19:06] <ajpiano> i guess it doesn't really matter for anyone other than timmy and me
[09:19:11] <rwaldron> basically, you owe us all lunch now
[09:19:16] <ajpiano> everyone else is either on boston or skype :D
[09:19:19] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking about coming up
[09:19:24] <jaubourg> rick: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O83sZV360A
[09:19:30] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: that would be awesome
[09:19:35] <addyosmani> This July, ajpiano?
[09:19:40] <ajpiano> addyosmani yea
[09:19:44] <DaveMethvin> i've been on the west coast for 2 weeks straight, finally got back friday
[09:19:48] <addyosmani> 11th/12th works for me
[09:19:52] <ajpiano> yeesh
[09:19:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that sounds awesome
[09:19:59] <rwaldron> jaubourg http://gyazo.com/e3333eedd40cc977afc0f4d9da535b11.png
[09:20:10] <jaubourg> fuuuuu
[09:20:35] <jaubourg> rick: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q0lRGZ1zOg
[09:21:04] <DaveMethvin> the 11th/12th works for me, at least atm
[09:21:26] <jaubourg> just let me know guys and I'll stick around :)
[09:21:49] <rwaldron> i'll have to look at this later
[09:21:53] <rwaldron> no speakers on this machine
[09:22:04] <ajpiano> i'm checking the date w/ nate
[09:22:50] <danheberden> ajpiano will ARIA be an issue? (same dates)
[09:22:57] <ajpiano> mfer
[09:23:00] <ajpiano> i KNEW that date was bad
[09:23:12] <ajpiano> something in my head was ticking
[09:23:16] <ajpiano> but i'm not necessarily sure it's bad
[09:23:21] <ajpiano> you might be the only overlap
[09:23:32] <jaubourg> just so you all know, I have a solution for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/411 involving setTimeout( ..., 0 )... my usual solution to everything
[09:23:37] <danheberden> well i've been a bit aloof re: bugs team, so probably not a big deal re: me
[09:24:04] <jaubourg> waiting for 1.6.2 to be out to put it in
[09:24:05] <ajpiano> danheberden: scott_gonzalez, rworth, and jzaefferer weren't at the last bugs sprint day
[09:24:17] <danheberden> ya - i think it'll be fine
[09:24:27] <ajpiano> might even be easier to get their input if we need, if we know everyone is at least in jquery-mode
[09:24:36] <DaveMethvin> true
[09:24:44] <danheberden> coo
[09:24:44] <ajpiano> and jzaefferer will be in the same timezone :D
[09:24:57] <danheberden> lol phyiscally
[09:25:54] <ajpiano> anything else to talk about
[09:26:14] <ajpiano> ?
[09:26:44] <rwaldron> lunch?
[09:26:52] <ajpiano> i just sort of wanted to check in cause i missed last week
[09:27:37] <DaveMethvin> any exciting developments on the 1.7 front?
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> I'm working on ".on()"
[09:27:54] <rwaldron> $.browser.chrome
[09:28:02] * rwaldron shudders
[09:28:04] <DaveMethvin> YEAH!
[09:28:17] <rwaldron> so, it's in the queue
[09:28:25] <DaveMethvin> we better hold up 1.6.2 for that
[09:28:36] <JohnResig> hey guys sorry about this, i'm currently on the caltrain typing on my phone, forgot that the meeting would be at 9am here, sorry!
[09:28:38] <jaubourg> I need to come back to $.Callbacks, remove the fat, all that
[09:28:39] <rwaldron> i actually want to do my event data props _after_ you have a stable on()
[09:28:55] <ajpiano> JohnResig: notes are in goog doc from what we talked about so far
[09:28:56] <jaubourg> John: no biggy, I was soooo late myself ;)
[09:29:01] <rwaldron> jaubourg hates my constructed instances of Callback queues
[09:29:04] <ajpiano> but goog docs on phone is a nonstarter
[09:29:05] <rwaldron> :(
[09:29:20] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig: np, i think the main issue is whether 1.6.2 is ready to go ... timmywil is not here and we wanted to get  his take
[09:29:26] <JohnResig> i'l read when i get to the office
[09:29:32] <ajpiano> sounds good
[09:29:42] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: google docs has a nice android app now
[09:29:49] <JohnResig> ah, ok.  i hope we can get it out soon!
[09:29:51] <ajpiano> for bugs sprint we'd have the room all of monday and until 2:30 on tuesday, does that seem reasonable to everyone?
[09:30:05] <rwaldron> +1
[09:30:06] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: seems good to me,
[09:30:14] <ajpiano> cool!
[09:30:24] <JohnResig> yeah, we need to vote on timmy's airfare
[09:30:28] <ajpiano> we can move somewhere with food or something if we feel like continuing
[09:30:29] <DaveMethvin> lets hope we run out of bugs by noon tuesday
[09:30:37] <JohnResig> i suspect he'll crash with me
[09:30:54] <jaubourg> any new on the exact date for jqcon boston?
[09:30:59] <jaubourg> (just curious)
[09:31:02] <jaubourg> news
[09:31:05] <rwaldron> oof
[09:31:11] <rwaldron> same as jsconf.eu
[09:31:13] <rwaldron> :(
[09:31:17] <jaubourg> :|
[09:31:18] <addyosmani> :(
[09:31:27] <rwaldron> thats a lot of sadfaces
[09:31:28] <JohnResig> oxt 1st and 2nd
[09:31:54] <jaubourg> fuuuuu
[09:32:01] <Murali> cheers
[09:32:01] <addyosmani> I don't think a lot of people that wanted jsconf.eu tix got em anyway. Should be alright for jqcon
[09:32:05] <kswedberg> we kinda didn't have a choice. terribly tough to get anything in Boston around that time
[09:32:05] <rwaldron> inorite
[09:32:50] <jaubourg> well, I'll see if my proposal for jsconf.eu is taken up... I was too late for tickets... time flies :/
[09:33:38] <addyosmani> early birds sold out in 5 seconds, regulars in 10 mins jaubourg. don't feel too bad
[09:33:49] <addyosmani> sure your proposal will get accepted :)
[09:34:27] <ajpiano> alas.
[09:34:27] <jaubourg> we'll see, sucks not to be able to divide in two and be at jqcon too :/
[09:35:05] <danheberden> thats all for the agenda items, ya?
[09:35:14] <danheberden> (i.e. rest of convos can be moved to -dev)
[09:35:24] <ajpiano> seems like it
[09:35:33] <DaveMethvin> thanks for keeping the notes ajpiano!
[09:35:45] <JohnResig> ttyl all! thanks for holding the meeting :)
[09:35:45] <ajpiano> np
