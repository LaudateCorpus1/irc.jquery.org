[09:01:20] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:22] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:23] <gnarf> semi here
[09:01:33] <mikesherov> semi here, I have an interview in a few moments
[09:01:34] <petersendidit> hey
[09:01:42] <mikesherov> Interviewing a product manager, fun
[09:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> oh joy
[09:02:43] <mikesherov> All I need to know, and perhaps we should discuss it at a better time, is the 1.11 roadmap. I want to make sure the wiki and the bug tracker are accurate and that we're attacking those items.
[09:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Ok, let's discuss later today or tomorrow.
[09:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> The download builder blog post went live.
[09:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> I saw a lot of manual rewtweets.
[09:04:29] <rxaviers> nice!
[09:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket count is still dropping :-)
[09:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> Down to 324.
[09:06:47] <kborchers> nice
[09:07:07] <rxaviers> good to hear, good work guys
[09:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit updated the classes option PR based on the new plan.
[09:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> He just pushed another commit this morning, so I need to do another round of review.
[09:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> But it seems like we might have something sane now.
[09:09:47] <gnarf> gotta run, bbiab
[09:09:49] <petersendidit> I can start working on switching the other widgets once we like what we have
[09:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: That'd be great.
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers has a PR for pointer events special events implementation: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/957
[09:12:30] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #957 by kborchers (3d 12h ago): Code Review Pointer Special Event
[09:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like gnarf did a review and thought it looked good :-)
[09:13:00] <kborchers> i have a few more commits i need to push to that but i broke MSPointer late last night so need to look at it
[09:13:15] <kborchers> seems like every change i make works everywhere and breaks MSPointer stuff :)
[09:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:15:15] <tj_vantoll1> Here now.
[09:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, also DaveMethvin wrote some tests for Pointer Events spec.
[09:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently there was a lot of interest in Pointer Events at Test the Web Forward.
[09:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> Multiple people were writing tests.
[09:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> I think DaveMethvin is helping go through all the tests and merge them.
[09:16:07] <DaveMethvin> eyp
[09:16:10] <DaveMethvin> yep even
[09:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> Then they'll be moved into the official hg repo.
[09:16:21] <mikesherov> I'm here again
[09:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately it doesn't look like Pointer Events will move to git :-(
[09:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to releases...
[09:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure many of you have noticed that I started cherry-picking into 1-10-stable.
[09:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> Getting ready for 1.10.3
[09:17:34] <mikesherov> Yeah, I noticed
[09:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to pull in as much as I can and release soon.
[09:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll work on cherry-picking into 1-9-stable.
[09:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not too many bug fixes, just getting support for newer jQuery core.
[09:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> So, interactions...
[09:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> Reviewing this stuff is hard.
[09:19:32] <mikesherov> Yeah, totally
[09:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> I really wish Dave Stein had written tests as he was writing code.
[09:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> I did an intial pass over the draggable code.
[09:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> And I've got a few things I want to dig into.
[09:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> And I need to compare the test suite to master.
[09:20:18] <mikesherov> so, the order of events there was
[09:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> But I also kind of want to do a rebase.
[09:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> Clean up the history a bit.
[09:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> Every time I try to track something down, it's crazytown.
[09:20:57] <mikesherov> rewrite, then write some tests for rewrite, then write test for all options against master
[09:21:03] <mikesherov> then start fixing bugs against master
[09:21:13] <mikesherov> we have a pretty decent suite now in master for draggable
[09:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, basically the opposite of how we did the other refactors.
[09:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> Do you think an rebase with squashed commits is reasonable?
[09:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like it'd be a lot of work.
[09:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> But it should also make the history sane to look through.
[09:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> The number of broken commits is what concerns me.
[09:22:57] <mikesherov> I think we should just rebase all the commits into 1, one for test suite, 1 for the code
[09:23:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Dave Stein was committing as he went as a orking branch
[09:23:30] <mikesherov> not everyone view it as published history
[09:23:35] <mikesherov> it's understandable IMO
[09:23:48] <mikesherov> ugh, I'm a typo maniac today
[09:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I'm a typo maniac every day.
[09:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> If we're going to squash it all, we should do it soon.
[09:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> So that future commits are available.
[09:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:28:15] <rxaviers> Did you guys have a chance to read the duplicate cutoff thing? Given the long comments I saw on other PRs and all the things going on, I dont think so. Am I right? :P
[09:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> No, I haven't.
[09:31:08] <rxaviers> feels like this would happen soon? I have very highlevel question there
[09:31:23] <rxaviers> that I would like to hear what you guys think
[09:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, soon.
[09:31:44] <rxaviers> this would unlock me to code more
[09:31:53] <rxaviers> cool thanks
[09:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'll read the comment today, but I might not get a chance to review the code today.
[09:32:09] <rxaviers> if you need me to do anything or to make stuff there clearer, plz just let me know
[09:32:24] <rxaviers> ok, it's not about code level yet
[09:32:35] <rxaviers> (that I refer ^)
[09:33:02] <rxaviers> that's all from my side
