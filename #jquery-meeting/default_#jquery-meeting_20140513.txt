[01:02:39] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[01:02:59] <uGoMobi> hi
[01:03:01] <Minkyeong> Hi!
[01:03:01] <Hyunsook> Hi~
[01:03:14] <Kangsik> Hi all. :-)
[01:03:18] <_|Nix|_> How's it going?
[01:03:25] <Changsuk> All: I moved~
[01:03:39] <Kangsik> @_|NIX|_: I saw your comments in gitHub.
[01:03:43] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: IRL?
[01:03:49] <Kangsik> @_|NIX|_: I have one question in your words. You said to me that replace old examples code in index.php.
[01:03:58] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Right.
[01:04:10] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: IRL? what does it mean?
[01:04:18] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I-n R-eal L-ife.
[01:04:24] <Kangsik> @_|Nix|_: what is correct selection in the below guides?
[01:04:24] <Kangsik> A : Replace only old exmplaes code(data-shadow and data-corner).
[01:04:24] <Kangsik> B : Replace old examples code and remove new examples code.
[01:04:24] <Kangsik> I think that new examples code are same as changing old examples.
[01:04:44] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: [A]
[01:04:57] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, Kangsik: haha~
[01:05:10] <Kangsik> @_|Nix|_: Yes. Thanks :-)
[01:05:15] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[01:05:17] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: ha ha ~~ No.... My life is sticked.
[01:05:44] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: OK, so you meant you moved from #web-ui-fw to #jquery-meeting then, I guess, right?
[01:05:57] <uGoMobi> For reference... we are talking about this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348
[01:06:02] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: yes~! Sure~~
[01:06:21] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Yep!
[01:06:40] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: Basically, we don't want to give people examples that use deprecated code.
[01:06:57] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: it is for the people who read the log of this channel
[01:07:24] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: aha~~ OK. ^^;
[01:07:35] <Kangsik> @_|Nix|_: Yes. Thank your for your advice. :-)
[01:07:52] <_|Nix|_> Kangsik: NP! Good job on the PR!
[01:08:19] <uGoMobi> yeah, thanks Kangsik !
[01:08:57] <_|Nix|_> So, after this last change, library and demos should be pretty much covered.
[01:09:10] <Kangsik> @_|Nix|_, uGoMobi: It's my pleasure. :-)
[01:09:25] <_|Nix|_> All we need after that is API docs and upgrade guide, the latter of which uGoMobi can probably take care of, right uGoMobi?
[01:10:01] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Really? TIA~!
[01:10:23] <_|Nix|_> ... and then we can move on to another widget.
[01:11:05] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi: Oh~! Thanks!
[01:11:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, I can create a branch with an 1.5 upgrade guide and start with this change/deprecation
[01:11:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just had a thought: If we cannot remove style options from all widgets in time for 1.5, we could deprecate those we have covered, and keep them deprecated until all widgets have removed style options, and then, after each widget's style options have been deprecated for at least one version, we remove them.
[01:11:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we shouldn't merge Kangsik's PR before I have done that
[01:11:56] <_|Nix|_> ... and before the API docs PR is ready.
[01:12:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, would be nice if we can finish all for 1.5 but if not that seems the right way to go
[01:12:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't believe there's a rule that says the deprecation period is exactly one version - just that it's at least one version.
[01:12:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true
[01:13:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: often it's just us who add "and will be removed in 1.x"
[01:13:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: might be good to stick to the minimum and not add that
[01:16:00] <_|Nix|_> Sorry. had some trouble connecting.
[01:16:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, when we know that it's gonna be gone, we better say so, especially if some things will be gone and others will remain deprecated for another version.
[01:17:26] <_|Nix|_> Anyhoo ... let's just see how far we can get. Hopefully we can cover all widgets.
[01:18:01] <_|Nix|_> So, on that cheery note, are we good for another week? Any other topics?
[01:18:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, if we know for sure we can add the info
[01:19:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ I think we are good
[01:19:13] <Hyunsook> _|Nix|_: That's all, I think.
[01:19:27] <_|Nix|_> Alright, thanks all!
[01:19:28] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: No, I don't have anything to tell you and just joined here to follow issues.
[01:19:40] <_|Nix|_> Have a productive week, followed by a great weekend!
