[12:08:27] <arschmitz> hi
[12:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Any update on the button compatibility bug?
[12:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15109
[12:10:29] <arschmitz> i spent most of last wednesday working on it but still dont quite have it right
[12:10:46] <arschmitz> its a lot more complicated then i thought i was planning on working on it this morning but meetings...
[12:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> Do you need any help or just more time?
[12:11:32] <arschmitz> at the moment just more time but i may ping you again
[12:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> I fixed a bug that someone reported in the jQuery bug tracker.
[12:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> They were complaining that errors in `remove` events get swallowed.
[12:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/1f2011ece3fe6847874677e9a8210fa202498ccb
[12:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> We had the event triggering wrapped in a try/catch because a bug in core with getting the list of events.
[12:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> But that bug doesn't exist in any of the versions we support anymore.
[12:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> So I just removed the try/catch.
[12:13:24] <arschmitz> cool
[12:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> Hooray for comments that tell us why we're doing stuff :-)
[12:14:44] <arschmitz> comments that are usefull thats just silly
[12:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> Also, hooray for contributors that are willing to create follow up PRs.
[12:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> The bug for custom handles getting removed on update in resizable (https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15084) has been fixed.
[12:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> I asked Konstantin Dinev to look into this because he had submitted a PR that added the ability to update handles.
[12:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> So he submitted a PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1798
[12:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, I guess I shouldn't say it's been fixed yet, since the PR hasn't been merged.
[12:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> But at least we have the PR and his previous PRs have been very good.
[12:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:22:19] <arschmitz> no
[12:27:46] <scott_gonzalez>    I guess that's all for today.
[12:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone
