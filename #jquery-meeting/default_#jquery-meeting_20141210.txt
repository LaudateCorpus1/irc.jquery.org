[09:01:21] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:26] <jperrault> o/
[09:02:08] <fnagel> hey
[09:03:04] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> So, we got a report of a new regression in 1.11.2
[09:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10721
[09:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Likely caused by https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/6833a3169775d4c15dd5e68c96bc63ad0187035e
[09:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> dekajp pinged me and said he'll work on the fix since he caused the regression.
[09:04:54] <jzaefferer> That's something
[09:06:01] <jzaefferer> Anything new on AMD? rxaviers?
[09:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not too often a contributor notices a regression and offers to fix without anyone asking.
[09:06:22] <rxaviers> I need someone to take a look at some of those bugs
[09:06:34] <rxaviers> - Fix position fractions
[09:07:07] <rxaviers> Now, it returns integers instead of decimals
[09:07:10] <rxaviers> ?
[09:07:26] <rxaviers> - Fix QUnit's expect() failures
[09:07:51] <jzaefferer> Looks like my comment here didn't get the attention it deserved: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1335#issuecomment-63818170
[09:08:03] <jzaefferer> Only commits afterwards were "port all others"
[09:08:30] <rxaviers> Please could you be a little more specific?
[09:08:47] <jzaefferer> It looks like you ignored my comment
[09:09:14] <rxaviers> at
[09:10:04] <jzaefferer> Addressing that might resolve those issues, at least some of them
[09:10:13] <jzaefferer> Should try that first
[09:10:24] <rxaviers> Sorry I'm lost. Addressing what please?
[09:10:49] <rxaviers> You talk about smashing all the files in test/unit/helper/, export window.helper.jqueryUrl, The order isn't consistent...
[09:10:56] <jzaefferer> Yes, that
[09:11:03] <jzaefferer> We can go through that tomorrow before we talk about Globalize
[09:11:11] <rxaviers> please, ok.
[09:11:13] <mikesherov> hi!
[09:11:15] <rxaviers> thanks
[09:11:39] <jzaefferer> hey mikesherov, did you see my comments on your comments?
[09:12:01] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: nooo?
[09:12:23] <jzaefferer> rather boring, really
[09:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> Not boring. You said we're ready to land effects rewrite!
[09:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> Though your other comments were boring :-P
[09:13:07] <jzaefferer> also I have to go, I don't really have anything else to add anyway. Spent my time recently on QUnit 1.16 (lets upgrade!) and reviewing Globalize PRs
[09:13:22] <mikesherov> HOORAY!
[09:13:29] <mikesherov> I'll fix the nits from jzaefferer
[09:13:46] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: any thoughts on squash strategy?
[09:13:47] <rxaviers> And i know this meeting is not about Globalize. But, since jzaefferer referenced it.. Just check it out:
[09:13:48] <rxaviers> console.log( Globalize("ar").formatCurrency( 69900, "USD" ) );
[09:13:48] <rxaviers> US$ ٦٩٬٩٠٠٫٠٠
[09:13:50] <rxaviers> \o/
[09:14:17] <rxaviers> currency formatting support using different numbering systems
[09:14:27] <arschmitz> wooo
[09:14:39] <arschmitz> that was the last remaining blocker for spinner right?
[09:14:59] <jzaefferer> Still need parsing
[09:15:00] <rxaviers> needs the parser too :-(
[09:15:07] <arschmitz> ah right
[09:15:16] <arschmitz> well still closer
[09:15:20] <rxaviers> but almost there
[09:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Let's talk about that after the meeting.
[09:15:23] <jzaefferer> Hopefully most of the infrastructure can be reused
[09:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, after dev leads meeting, unless this ends early.
[09:15:48] <mikesherov> ok
[09:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> So excited to land this :-)
[09:16:34] <mikesherov> me too!
[09:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> Also excited about progress on Globalize :-)
[09:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you see the ticket about .finish()?
[09:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't even know this existed.
[09:16:56] <rxaviers> ;)
[09:18:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[09:18:36] <mikesherov> so, .stop, .finish, any variant doesn't work right on the "multieffects"
[09:18:43] <mikesherov> also, no effects queue, so...
[09:18:52] <mikesherov> there is work to be done to get that stuff right
[09:19:06] <mikesherov> gnarf has an idea how to address with queue hooks
[09:19:15] <mikesherov> but didn't want it holding up the rewrite
[09:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:25] <jzaefferer> Finish etc are all existing problems, independent of the rewrite?
[09:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:24:42] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: what about classes?
[09:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> Has anyone had a chance to look over the PR?
[09:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> I've been busy with site upgrades, so haven't gotten to it yet.
[09:25:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we discussed last week different api options
[09:25:09] <arschmitz> waiting for feed back
[09:25:41] <arschmitz> as well as if we should have classes auto remove in destroy
[09:26:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: mikesherov: I remember bringing up the stop/finish problems on the "multi effects" a while back
[09:27:05] <gnarf> but i don't think we can actually solve them until we can say min jQuery is 1.8
[09:27:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If there's a solution that works with 1.8, are we able to opt-in based on an exposed API?
[09:27:50] <mikesherov> then scott_gonzalez said we can detect
[09:27:54] <mikesherov> and fix for 1.8+
[09:29:38] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: maybe we can review classes together with Scott tomorrow morning?
[09:29:48] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:30:18] <arschmitz> button is updated as much as possible but i have not switched classes stuff until we decide this
[09:30:33] <arschmitz> its also holding up all 1.5 work in mobile
[09:30:46] <jzaefferer> Yeah, one of several reasons to get classes done
[09:30:46] <arschmitz> so a decision would be really really helpfull
[09:31:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've moved it up on my todo list.
[09:31:51] <gnarf> actually i think what we need is 1.
[09:31:52] <gnarf> 1.7
[09:32:11] <gnarf> $.fn.queue passes the queue function a second "hooks" argument
[09:32:14] <mikesherov> 1.8 was effects rewrite
[09:32:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: are you available tomorrow morning?
[09:32:21] <mikesherov> 1.7 was events rewrite
[09:32:21] <gnarf> right 1.7 did the queue update tho
[09:32:24] <mikesherov> kk
[09:32:27] <arschmitz> 1.7 we all ready talked about for UI recently
[09:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Around 9:00a ET, yeah
[09:32:55] <arschmitz> to remove the event aliases
[09:33:01] <gnarf> mikesherov: so the way to fill it in is wherever you make the .queue( doAnAnim ) make doAnAnim(next, hooks) and define a hooks.stop()
[09:33:03] <jzaefferer> Sounds good
[09:33:04] <arschmitz> 9:00 works for me
[09:33:24] <gnarf> still undocumented: http://api.jquery.com/queue/#queue-queueName-callback :(
[09:34:17] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you file an issue for that?
[09:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> At least then it's documented that it's not documented ;-)
[09:35:19] <jzaefferer> Core has many documented undocumented features, like outerWidth setter :/
[09:36:21] <gnarf> mikesherov: it should know how to handle stop( gotoEnd )
[09:36:59] <mikesherov> gnarf: ok
[09:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that was everything on the agenda.
[09:37:09] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:37:26] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/queue/delay.js is a dead simple example of hooks.stop also mikesherov
[09:37:48] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Any schedule for next calendar review?
[09:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> There were a few things above it on my list, but I just moved it under classes.
[09:38:26] <gnarf> mikesherov: also, there used to be some "direct queue manipulation" to get the effects queued in the "right place"
[09:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> So 1) finish site updates, 2) classes PR, 3) calendar PR
[09:38:56] <fnagel> Ok, thanks for the info!
[09:39:13] <mikesherov> gnarf: that's still there
[09:39:15] <gnarf> mikesherov: if 1.7+ is around we can use the new animation.queue option also - but thats not "detectable" http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: That means I will likely get to it on Friday.
[09:39:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so then can we talk about min version bump to 1.7?
[09:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, let's talk 1.7.
[09:39:56] <gnarf> mikesherov: it would be detectable if you detected the queueHooks getting passed into your queue() function
[09:40:12] <mikesherov> arguments for min 1.7:
[09:40:25] <mikesherov> effects can benefit from the simplified queueing stuff
[09:40:44] <arschmitz> remove the dependency on the core event alias module
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:40:48] <gnarf> so you could actually have two paths - one that does it the old "hack these queue functions in right after myself" way - and one that does it the "gnarf tried to make this easier for jQuery UI effects" way :)
[09:40:48] <mikesherov> 1.7 means stop works always
[09:40:50] <scott_gonzalez> we can use.on()
[09:40:59] <mikesherov> yes, .on is the big one
[09:41:07] <mikesherov> in terms of clarity
[09:41:26] <mikesherov> gnarf: I maintained the hack way
[09:41:32] <mikesherov> but exposed it as a proper function
[09:41:50] <gnarf> saw that, and total +1
[09:41:57] <mikesherov> but if there's a way to inject in the queue now, I should probably land that if we bump to 1.7 and not expose the "unshift"
[09:41:59] <gnarf> but i don't like the idea of "exposing" it :)
[09:42:02] <mikesherov> right
[09:42:09] <mikesherov> if we go 1.7
[09:42:13] <mikesherov> I can get rid of it completely
[09:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> attroperties
[09:42:34] <mikesherov> and if we don't go min 1.7 I can not *document* it so that at least we can remove when 1.7 is the true min
[09:42:41] <mikesherov> attroproperties yeah
[09:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> No more need to patch .removeData() for 1.6 bugs.
[09:43:12] <gnarf> arguments against?
[09:43:39] <gnarf> I think bumping is always worthwhile, we don't necesarily need to re-iterate our wins...
[09:43:48] <arschmitz> honestly its generally more painful to upgrade ui then core
[09:43:50] <mikesherov> we should query splunk to correlate people who download jquery UI 1.11 with jquery 1.6
[09:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> We can all .outerWidth/Height() on documents and windows
[09:44:04] <arschmitz> do we really think somone is going to jump to 1.12 and still use core 1.6?
[09:44:14] <mikesherov> I don't
[09:44:21] <mikesherov> but there is a way to guess via splunk
[09:44:24] <arschmitz> i dont either
[09:44:25] <gnarf> not really
[09:44:29] <gnarf> re: splunk
[09:44:43] <mikesherov> gnarf we can't correlate IPs to urls they are downloading off te CDN?
[09:44:45] <gnarf> we don't track core downloads, nor do we track enough information to track sessions between the two
[09:44:50] <mikesherov> kk
[09:44:51] <gnarf> mikesherov: we don't have cdn stats
[09:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> I've seen first hand companies upgrade UI and not core.
[09:45:04] <gnarf> mikesherov: but maxcdn has an API if someone wants to do it
[09:45:07] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: same here
[09:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> With the thought being that it's much easier to find all uses of UI than to retest your entire app.
[09:45:30] <gnarf> 1.7 is pre-migrate too
[09:45:39] <gnarf> so we can't suggest migrating
[09:45:54] <arschmitz> but as big a gap as 1.6 core and 1.12 of ui thats a huge gap
[09:46:17] <mikesherov> right, we're talking almost 4 years since 1.7
[09:46:25] <gnarf> Date: Thu Nov 3 16:18:21 2011 -0400 --- 3
[09:46:45] <mikesherov> sorry, 3
[09:46:59] <mikesherov> still a wile
[09:47:03] <mikesherov> while*
[09:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery/1/all
[09:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> This doesn't tell us core + UI versions though.
[09:48:02] <arschmitz> i dont doubt people still use 1.6
[09:48:10] <arschmitz> i just doubt they will be using it with ui 1.12
[09:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> So basically we go from support 81.6% of jQuery users to 75.9%.
[09:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's probably ok.
[09:49:04] <gnarf> i kinda agree - only losing a ~5% support gap
[09:49:10] <gnarf> and its 3 years ago version
[09:49:12] <gnarf> so like
[09:49:17] <gnarf> seems okay
[09:49:23] <arschmitz> and remember how many sites are never updated
[09:49:32] <arschmitz> i bet a big chunk of those 5% fall into that
[09:49:46] <arschmitz> but there is no way to know
[09:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> And 1.6 usage is dropping
[09:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery-1.6.4
[09:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery-1.6.3
[09:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery-1.6.2
[09:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery-1.6.1
[09:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> As would be expected.
[09:50:55] <arschmitz> just for reference mobile is 1.8+ currently
[09:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> I definitely don't want to drop 1.7.
[09:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm ok with dropping 1.6 now.
[09:53:44] <mikesherov> so, for 1.12?
[09:53:59] <mikesherov> I want to land effects as is, and then not document $.effects.unshift
[09:54:03] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:54:11] <arschmitz> yeah this actually effects button because i need to know if i can use on
[09:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10723
[09:56:20] <arschmitz> that means ill dig back up my branch removing the dependency on the event alias module
[09:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:58:27] <scott_gonzalez> And we're out of time.
[09:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
