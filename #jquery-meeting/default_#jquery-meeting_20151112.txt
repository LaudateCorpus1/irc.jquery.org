[12:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[12:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, bethge, switching up nicks on us.
[12:01:11] <bethge> Sorry about that, for the sake of consistency
[12:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[12:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's just you and me right now. arschmitz may not actually be here.
[12:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let's wait a few minutes and see if anyone else shows up.
[12:02:43] <bethge> Sounds good
[12:07:03] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it doesn't seem like anyone else is going to show up.
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> So, the only thing on the agenda right now is https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/242
[12:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> The Firefox bug was only filed two days ago. So I'm not sure if this is a new bug in Firefox or just coincidence.
[12:09:06] <bethge> Indeed. It occurs in a number of FF Versions for Ubuntu
[12:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think your PR is safe to land.
[12:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm happy to do a 0.4.1 release with just this fix since it's a pretty major regression for us.
[12:12:07] <bethge> Ok great. I hope the change doesn't cause other issues.
[12:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't seem like it would.
[12:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> The one new condition should never occur in a proper implementation.
[12:13:46] <bethge> Thats true
[12:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to talk to you about this after the meeting, but since we're effectively done and nobody else is here...
[12:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> Are you interested in officially joining the PEP team?
[12:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> You're one of the most active contributors, including team members.
[12:15:13] <bethge> Would be a honour
[12:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> In that case, CONGRATS!
[12:15:44] <bethge> Thank you very much!
[12:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for everything you've done so far. It's been a huge help.
[12:17:46] <bethge> It's a great experience and I am happy to be able to contribute to open source
[12:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to head out for lunch, but I'll ping you later with some more info.
[12:19:59] <bethge> Great, bon appetit. :)
