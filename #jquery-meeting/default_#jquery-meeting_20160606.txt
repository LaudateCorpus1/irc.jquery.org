[12:03:49] <gibson042> half-present
[12:04:00] <timmywil> hmm, was hoping Dave would be here for the TSC convo, but it's time senstitive
[12:05:03] <m_gol> present
[12:05:36] <m_gol> I need to run early today, though
[12:06:07] <jbedard> I'm here, will probably need to leave in 25 mins
[12:06:17] <timmywil> so, I'm not sure if everyone has seen the collaboration board and TSC proposal, but we've been asked to get to back to Kris on who we'd like to be grouped with.
[12:06:59] <m_gol> what TSC proposal?
[12:07:18] <timmywil> this was the original structure https://github.com/jquery-foundation/CB/blob/7bf25d754180717714365bd131648f1d95a46110/Technical-Org-Structure.pdf
[12:08:56] <timmywil> while the goals of the TSCs are being discussed (https://github.com/jquery-foundation/CB/issues/3), I think it would be good to discuss which projects we'd benefit from collaborating with most often (at least that's how I'm looking at).
[12:09:49] <timmywil> the convo has mostly been among project leads, but I don't want to make a decision by myself.
[12:10:01] <timmywil> and things can change
[12:10:10] <timmywil> obviously sizzle makes sense
[12:10:35] <gibson042> not only does it make sense, it also makes the ecosystem argument
[12:10:56] <timmywil> any others pop out?
[12:11:28] <m_gol> The graph seems to make sense. It's the first time I'm seeing it (& the issue) so it's hard to say more
[12:12:15] <markelog> in eslint team zakas just cc everyone to that letter :)
[12:12:36] <timmywil> which letter?
[12:13:08] <markelog> there is a letter that explain what tsc is and why it is a bad name :)
[12:13:33] <markelog> and that it would be good for project to collaborate
[12:13:34] <timmywil> the 40-email thread?
[12:13:52] <timmywil> that convo was moved to the github issue
[12:14:07] <markelog> no, probably not
[12:14:16] <markelog> although not sure
[12:15:25] <timmywil> ok, well, if there are no objections, I can tell kris that we're fine with starting out with the proposed group. To be honest, I'm not sure how much difference this will make, especially as the goals are still being clarified.
[12:16:26] <timmywil> but I think it's a good idea to allow projects to focus on coding, which we already do for the most part at core
[12:17:10] <timmywil> mostly, I wanted to put this on your radar. Chime in on the goal issue if something stands out.
[12:19:32] <timmywil> Ok, moving on
[12:20:37] <timmywil> I noticed m_gol added that mobile reported some breakages
[12:21:10] <m_gol> all the versions depend on $.event.props etc.
[12:21:13] <timmywil> looks like it was using $.event.props, but I think Dave was going to provide a fix
[12:21:15] <m_gol> just wanted to put it on the radar
[12:21:47] <timmywil> yup
[12:22:01] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3096
[12:22:27] <timmywil> looks good to me. is it okay to land?
[12:23:11] <markelog> gibson042: .
[12:23:39] <gibson042> unfortunately, no
[12:23:40] <timmywil> oh, it's using $
[12:23:42] <gibson042> it needs cleanup
[12:23:43] <markelog> this is only for ff?
[12:23:54] <gibson042> I failed in the conversation with that contributor
[12:24:35] <m_gol> I need to run, cu
[12:24:58] <timmywil> ok
[12:25:04] <gibson042> and I would actually characterize it as blocked by the offsetParent issue
[12:25:23] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3107
[12:25:36] <markelog> this is only for ff?
[12:25:38] <gibson042> but some independent improvements are possible
[12:26:07] <timmywil> markelog: the report is for ff, but I'm not sure
[12:26:13] <gibson042> the relationship is complicated
[12:26:47] <gibson042> current externally-observable behavior is wrong on Firefox because of some invalid assumptions made within the code
[12:26:50] <gibson042> IIRC
[12:27:11] <timmywil> ok to wait for 3.0.1 or 3.1.0?
[12:27:33] <markelog> about `clientLeft/Top` that is?
[12:27:42] <gibson042> yes, it's fine to wait
[12:28:22] <timmywil> cool. I think we can release 3.0 final this week, but I'll want to sync up with Dave first.
[12:28:36] <markelog> you don't want to land that, without offsetParent pull
[12:28:36] <markelog> ?
[12:29:32] <timmywil> I don't want to land either for 3.0.0.
[12:29:34] <gibson042> I think it could land, but some tests that I think should be included will fail if offsetParent() defaults to documentElement instead of document
[12:29:48] <gibson042> I also would like to hold them for after 3.0.0
[12:30:06] <timmywil> cool
[12:30:23] <timmywil> anything else?
[12:30:25] <markelog> could that be interpreted as breaking change?
[12:30:33] <markelog> timmywil: you need to be somewhere?
[12:30:39] <timmywil> no
[12:30:48] <gibson042> arguably, but I think it's a bug fix
[12:31:14] <markelog> it seems to return different results?
[12:31:25] <timmywil> agreed. the clientTop/Left addition was a bug fix, but it seems it needs removed now
[12:31:25] <jbedard> for jquery-mobile/event.props: we could consider adding whatever props they need to core now that it doesn't effect runtime performance
[12:31:31] <markelog> for some cases, obviously
[12:31:58] <markelog> timmywil: is there a ref to the bug fix?
[12:32:06] <timmywil> lemme see
[12:32:14] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/305f193aa57014dc7d8fa0739a3fefd47166cd44/src/offset.js#L171
[12:32:44] <markelog> yeah, i added that line
[12:32:49] <gibson042> I remember
[12:33:15] <markelog> what about it?
[12:33:18] <jbedard> i gotta run now too though, ttyl
[12:33:31] <markelog> this is only related to offsetParent
[12:33:49] <timmywil> I might be thinking of the scrollTop addition
[12:34:07] <timmywil> jbedard: thanks
[12:34:11] <gibson042> right... that offsetParent defaults to documentElement instead of document is a bug, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3107
[12:35:03] <gibson042> but it makes the also-incorrect .offset() right in some cases
[12:35:29] <markelog> and, so that is what https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3096 trying to fix?
[12:35:29] <gibson042> and all of this only manifests in unusual treatment of <html> and <body>
[12:36:04] <gibson042> yes
[12:36:41] <markelog> so if we land https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3107
[12:36:46] <markelog> we wouldn't need https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3096
[12:36:50] <timmywil> makes sense
[12:37:10] <timmywil> I mean, document vs documentElement makes sense
[12:37:39] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3096 - it would be nice to have though, right?
[12:37:41] <timmywil> the added tests are still appealing from 3107
[12:38:05] <gibson042> correct; 3107 is _almost_ there with respect to the tests that we should have
[12:38:06] <markelog> client properties wouldn't be needed to?
[12:38:34] <markelog> not a fact though, i suppose
[12:39:14] <markelog> okay, it seems i see the picture now, thanks
[12:39:26] <gibson042> my expectation is that fixing 3107 will break offset (or rather, expose its flaws) and that something like 3096 will then be necessary to fix them
[12:39:47] <timmywil> we say relative to the document in the docs, but is that the same as relative to the document element?
[12:40:00] <gibson042> which in the process will give us solid testing for unusual html/body styling
[12:40:11] <gibson042> it differs when body is positioned or bordered
[12:40:23] <gibson042> or when <html> is positioned or bordered
[12:40:37] <timmywil> right
[12:40:45] <timmywil> ok
[12:41:04] <timmywil> gibson042: could you add a comment to that PR?
[12:41:37] <timmywil> at least about us holding off on landing until the offsetParent issue is addressed
[12:41:49] <gibson042> ok
[12:42:07] <timmywil> markelog: did you have something else?
[12:42:18] <markelog> will send pr about eslint today :)
[12:42:25] <timmywil> nice
[12:42:28] <timmywil> thanks
[12:42:46] <markelog> not sure what's happening with mozilla team though
[12:42:57] <timmywil> yea, we got the mailing list together tho
[12:42:59] <markelog> do we need to do something?
[12:43:06] <timmywil> I'm not sure
[12:43:20] <timmywil> I need to take a look at the summary again
[12:43:27] <timmywil> scanning for action items
[12:43:31] <markelog> chrome implemented headless mode?
[12:43:37] <markelog> did you hear about it?
[12:44:13] <timmywil> I did, but I haven't tried it
[12:44:18] <markelog> the same thing i proposed to mozilla ppl on that nyc meeting
[12:44:39] <timmywil> would be great
[12:44:45] <markelog> okay, it seems there is stuff to talk with them, i just don't understand where and how to be begin
[12:46:00] <timmywil> I'll dig into it more and we could send a followup email
[12:46:08] <markelog> thanks :)
[12:46:19] <timmywil> thanks all! see you in -dev
