[11:06:37] <sfrisk> hi
[11:07:12] <jasperdegroot> hi sfrisk: how was SFO?
[11:07:33] <sfrisk> Great! super Jet lagged today and trying to catch up on work
[11:07:43] <arschmitz> snover: scott_gonzalez is on vacation
[11:07:52] <arschmitz> and not much had happened
[11:08:01] <snover> ok thanks :)
[11:08:21] <arschmitz> ill make sure there is one next week
[11:08:25] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:08:38] <arschmitz> snover: PEWG canceled the next like 3 or 4 weeks
[11:09:01] <arschmitz> So lets get started with mobile
[11:09:22] <arschmitz> Its been slow gabriel has been on vacation and cgack had some commit ments
[11:09:29] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:09:51] <arschmitz> Slider pr is close waiting on another review from me
[11:10:14] <cgack> then we I can fix rangeslider
[11:10:18] <arschmitz> yup
[11:11:19] <arschmitz> Iv been working on triaging the remaing 1.5 issues
[11:11:54] <arschmitz> closed a lot that we already fixed and either landed on 1.5 or the commits didnt get refrences to all the issues they fixed
[11:12:28] <arschmitz> A lot are also fixed by the remaining prs we have
[11:13:31] <arschmitz> Im making on a catagorizing them things we should fix for 1.5 / psuh to 1.6
[11:13:41] <jasperdegroot> I only labeled the obvious blocker issues
[11:14:01] <jasperdegroot> there are probably more that need to be fixed before alpha/beta
[11:14:33] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:14:41] <arschmitz> and some we can fix post alpha / beta
[11:14:44] <arschmitz> but pre final
[11:15:04] <jasperdegroot> yes
[11:15:28] <jasperdegroot> demos issues for example
[11:15:31] <arschmitz> yup
[11:15:43] <arschmitz> or testing ones
[11:16:39] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: is still on vacation and most of the open PR's are still his
[11:17:06] <arschmitz> cgack: you pinged on an issue this morning your working on right?
[11:17:23] <cgack> yeah i submitted a PR a bit ago for it
[11:17:45] <arschmitz> ok great
[11:17:52] <arschmitz> ill get that reviewed
[11:18:04] <arschmitz> try to get any new prs through the pipeline as quick as possible
[11:19:20] <jasperdegroot> I still have to update button, icon, controlgroup and checkbox radio demo pages but before i can do that we should fix some bugs
[11:19:40] <jasperdegroot> the problem with the corner classes, icons set with data-icon don't show up in single buttons, and buttons in controlgroups don't get a span with space between text and icon
[11:20:16] <jasperdegroot> i think fixes for some of all of these problems were already on their way
[11:20:28] <jasperdegroot> but didn't landed in 1.5-dev yet
[11:21:46] <jasperdegroot> oh and the data-classes attribute wasn't working last time i tested
[11:21:51] <arschmitz> it does
[11:21:59] <arschmitz> i sent you a link to a jsbin using it maybe you missed it
[11:22:10] <arschmitz> i should still have it just a sec
[11:22:23] <jasperdegroot> I tested data-classes="{ ui-textinput-search-icon: 'ui-icon ui-icon-search' }"
[11:22:35] <arschmitz> thats not valid json
[11:23:14] <arschmitz> it would have to be
[11:23:30] <arschmitz> data-classes={ 'ui-textinput-search-icon': 'ui-icon ui-icon-search' }
[11:23:50] <jasperdegroot> ah right
[11:24:03] <arschmitz> you passed a string
[11:26:12] <arschmitz> its very particular it must be valid json
[11:27:20] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:28:19] <arschmitz> So the other issues
[11:28:29] <arschmitz> You mentioned issues with corners?
[11:28:40] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:29:06] <jasperdegroot> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-dev/demos/controlgroup/
[11:29:22] <jasperdegroot> the corner classes are incorrect
[11:29:53] <arschmitz> hmm
[11:29:58] <arschmitz> thats odd
[11:29:59] <jasperdegroot> the first and last button do get the right corner class but all buttons get the ui-corner-all class
[11:30:18] <arschmitz> it must be something in the backcompat
[11:30:23] <arschmitz> because it fine in ui
[11:32:18] <jasperdegroot> I don't see any ui-corner-all in the 1.5-dev controlgroup JS files
[11:33:00] <jasperdegroot> the button widget is adding it?
[11:33:11] <arschmitz> must be
[11:34:11] <arschmitz> ill look at it right after the meeting
[11:34:36] <jasperdegroot> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/iATTg3dT/
[11:34:49] <jasperdegroot> oops, pastebin
[11:35:05] <jasperdegroot> anyways, looks like you already knew the cause arschmitz
[11:35:18] <arschmitz> apparently but that pr landed and didnt fix it
[11:35:30] <jasperdegroot> ok too bad
[11:36:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:36:34] <arschmitz> guess i was wrong about the cause
[11:37:10] <arschmitz> sfrisk: any progress on accordion
[11:40:30] <arschmitz> guess shes not here
[11:40:42] <arschmitz> Does anyone have anything else today
[11:40:55] <jasperdegroot> I am good
[11:42:00] <sfrisk> Sorry, was dragged away
[11:42:11] <sfrisk> doing some knowledge transfer before I leave my job
[11:42:24] <arschmitz> no problem
[11:42:26] <sfrisk> working on getting accordion working with the latest updates in 1.5-dev, then I shall PR
[11:42:32] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:42:58] <arschmitz> if you need anything on that just let me know\
