[12:03:06] <fnagel> hey
[12:03:10] <fnagel> again
[12:03:15] <fnagel> :-P
[12:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> Want to start with an update on datepicker?
[12:04:56] <fnagel> Added some commits and comments on the PR
[12:05:49] <fnagel> managed to contact Jon, regarding the upcoming a11y changes
[12:06:11] <fnagel> I invited him to join this meeting
[12:07:21] <fnagel> Thats it.
[12:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:07:40] <fnagel> Ahh, that issue with the date tests in december is fixed
[12:07:50] <fnagel> tldr: test did't make sense
[12:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[12:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you have an update on download builder?
[12:10:33] <rxaviers> I'm on standby https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/288
[12:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I just left a comment on the PR.
[12:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> My goal right now is to get the beta announced.
[12:13:32] <rxaviers> (y)
[12:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> So I asked jzaefferer is he's ok with the PR landing and we do the real fix later.
[12:15:56] <rxaviers> ok
[12:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer just replied.
[12:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why he's not in the meeting.
[12:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> But we're good to go with your changes :-)
[12:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's about it for today. Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:21:28] <fnagel> Noticed this ticket: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1656
[12:22:22] <fnagel> Do we accept  PRs for datepicker at all?
[12:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we accept bug fixes, but not new features.
[12:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> But we still have to be careful even with bug fixes because we've historically had a lot of regressions caused by bug fixes in datepicker.
[12:24:29] <fnagel> Ok, what is our general workflow regarding such tickets? Absolutly no offense, just curious as this is about two month old without an answer
[12:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, unfortunately, interaction and datepicker PRs generally just get ignored.
[12:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> Which is pretty terrible.
[12:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> But we just don't have many people willing to do the review and ensure that everything is good.
[12:26:06] <arschmitz> Hi sorry didnt realize half my irc channels were dissconnected
[12:26:14] <arschmitz> also have no back scroll
[12:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> You didn't miss much. We were just discussing this terrible developer named Alex ;-)
[12:27:23] <arschmitz> seems about right
[12:27:49] <fnagel> Ok, so, in general: PRs and tickets get answered / solved if anyone of the team is willing / finds some time. Which means I'm free to respond if I think it's useful.
[12:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> absolutely
[12:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally it is never the case that PRs just get ignored.
[12:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> But some portions of code are really just unmaintained right now.
[12:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> And that's why we've been on this long road to 2.0.
[12:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> I feel pretty terrible about how long it has taken though.
[12:29:05] <arschmitz> :-(
[12:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, I never would have guessed it would take this long.
[12:29:29] <arschmitz> me either
[12:29:59] <fnagel> Ok, will do my very best to pick up some selectmenu / datepicker PRs
[12:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[12:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did you have anything to discuss before we end the meeting?
[12:31:16] <arschmitz> just curious about beta
[12:31:31] <arschmitz> status on getting that announced
[12:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> That should finally happen very soon.
[12:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/288#issuecomment-173277930
[12:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Are you able to get that up now?
[12:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> That's the last piece before we announce.
[12:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to deploy the new download builder, then deploy jqueryui.com with the new download builder and we're good to go.
[12:34:29] <rxaviers> sure, will let you know when I do it
[12:36:13] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all. See everyone back in -dev.
