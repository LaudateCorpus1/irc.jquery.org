[09:00:35] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 m_gol timmywil rwaldron gnarf meeting time!
[09:00:44] <m_gol> present
[09:00:44] <gibson042> woooo
[09:00:47] <timmywil> Here
[09:00:49] <DaveMethvin> _markelog too if you're threre
[09:00:58] <_markelog> hey-hey!
[09:01:07] <DaveMethvin> awesome!
[09:01:08] <timmywil> But I'm double fisting meetings today
[09:01:13] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[09:01:30] <DaveMethvin> np i just recycled the  notes from last week
[09:01:34] <m_gol> ;)
[09:01:35] <timmywil> It's the mobile age
[09:01:49] <DaveMethvin> since we didn't have one
[09:02:23] <DaveMethvin> okay, so either nobody is testing beta2 or we did really good and there are no bugs
[09:02:26] <DaveMethvin> AHAHAHHAAH
[09:02:38] <m_gol> sure everyone is testing... right?
[09:02:44] <DaveMethvin> riiiiight
[09:03:15] <gibson042> they are, we just redirected all bug reports to Zepto :)
[09:03:24] <DaveMethvin> timmywil did domenic like the changes you did for node?
[09:03:36] <_markelog> gibson042: :-)
[09:03:43] <DaveMethvin> whoa yeah, zepto was whacking bugs all weekend
[09:03:43] <timmywil> Yea, he seems happy with them
[09:03:48] <DaveMethvin> ok good
[09:03:49] <m_gol> gibson042: to Zepto === to /dev/null? ;)
[09:03:53] <m_gol> I'm a bit worried about these ajax issues
[09:04:15] <DaveMethvin> if johnkpaul doesn't get to them by tonight i will
[09:04:15] <_markelog> it's sinon or our montly server problems?
[09:04:22] <DaveMethvin> probably sinon
[09:04:38] <DaveMethvin> somehow i managed to miss that before landing
[09:04:42] <m_gol> though it's weird, I cannot reproduce these bugs on localhost
[09:04:48] <m_gol> it all passes
[09:04:54] <m_gol> well, almost all
[09:05:11] <DaveMethvin> may be something that works fine on apache, which i am using too
[09:05:33] <m_gol> yeah...
[09:05:43] <DaveMethvin> anyway, if it doesn't get fixed by tomorrow i'll just back it out, don't want to leave things broken a long time
[09:05:44] <m_gol> I have an unload error but no these wierd ETag issues etc.
[09:05:48] <DaveMethvin> and i have a few other things to land
[09:05:48] <m_gol> yeah, agreed
[09:06:34] <DaveMethvin> geez, the tracker is dead it seems
[09:06:51] <m_gol> for me as well
[09:07:09] <m_gol> a possible option would be to not use fake timers in AJAX tests but to use them everywhere else
[09:07:19] <m_gol> though the nicer one would be to discover why it breaks there :)
[09:07:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah, if we could get the same speedup on ajax (or at least most of ajax tests) that would be awesome
[09:08:04] <DaveMethvin> did you notice how fast those tests run now?
[09:08:19] <timmywil> I didn't look, there are php sleep calls that may not mix well with sinon
[09:08:29] <DaveMethvin> gnarf it seems that bugs.jquery.com is down
[09:09:00] <DaveMethvin> well let's skip the ticket review then ;/
[09:09:16] <DaveMethvin> but we can talk about the data- names problem
[09:09:23] <m_gol> timmywil: I was thinking about the same thing but why do they work on localhost then?
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah you would think it wouldn't break but who knows
[09:10:07] <timmywil> Yea, idk
[09:10:58] <m_gol> hm, ok
[09:11:02] <DaveMethvin> i think i need a refresher on where the compat problems like with the data-foo-42 issue
[09:11:04] <m_gol> but the change was only in the effects module
[09:11:06] <m_gol> from what I see
[09:11:16] <DaveMethvin> but we include sinon in the test harness
[09:11:27] <DaveMethvin> so it might have a peripheral effect?
[09:11:47] <m_gol> but how does it cooperate with asyncTest function then?
[09:12:28] <DaveMethvin> my Magic 8 Ball says,, "Answer unclear, ask later" :)
[09:12:35] <m_gol> ;)
[09:12:52] <m_gol> and why was the change applied only to the effects module?
[09:13:01] <m_gol> I mean, changes asyncTest -> test with Sinon ticks
[09:13:37] <DaveMethvin> tbh i don't know, so that's why i wanted to take a look ... if asyncTest is affected then that could explain it
[09:13:44] <m_gol> yeah
[09:13:50] <timmywil> I'm still in favor of following spec, even though it is not backwards compatible. I'm also in favor of abandoning data-* handling with .data()
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> lol me too timmywil
[09:14:08] <timmywil> Sorry I'm noticing my messages may be delayed
[09:14:22] <DaveMethvin> but i think that ship has sailed as far as .data() is concerned
[09:14:39] <DaveMethvin> are you using a new irc client timmywil?
[09:14:53] <timmywil> I'm in the phine
[09:14:57] <timmywil> Phone
[09:15:03] <timmywil> On
[09:15:10] <DaveMethvin> i'm on mirc but need to find something better, it does a cpu  hang every few days and warms up my computer
[09:16:23] <m_gol> as for the npm stuff
[09:16:25] <m_gol> I was wondering
[09:16:37] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sorry I'm late, was just getting settled at Bocoup
[09:16:42] <DaveMethvin> np rwaldron
[09:16:52] <m_gol> we started by assuming it's going to be used in pure node so only 2.x makes sense there
[09:17:03] <m_gol> then it turned out there's browserify
[09:17:11] <m_gol> but we're still only publishing 2.x
[09:17:28] <m_gol> if we wanted to publish Migrate on npm, we should publish 1.x as well
[09:17:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin re: the data-foo-42 problem, what info are you looking for?
[09:17:35] <m_gol> otherwise I don't see much sense in it
[09:17:45] <rwaldron> I had filed a bug for the api docs to be updated
[09:17:49] <timmywil> Good point. I forgot i was going to suggest registering 1.x under a different name, say jquery-1.x
[09:18:17] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron just trying to figure out whether we had code changes to make there, but trac is down
[09:18:54] <DaveMethvin> on npm, it seems that anyone using npm for modules isn't going to need backcompat with old jquery
[09:18:57] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the result of the the last discussion we had: no changes
[09:19:00] <rwaldron> not possible
[09:19:04] <DaveMethvin> so migrate prob doesn't make sense
[09:19:21] <m_gol> agreed
[09:19:25] <m_gol> but 1.x potentially might ;)
[09:20:01] <DaveMethvin> how common is browserify? do people use it for web sites (vs apps)?
[09:20:17] <DaveMethvin> i just don't see the attraction
[09:20:19] <m_gol> no idea really... there surely is a huge fuss about it now
[09:20:29] <m_gol> but mostly by the really active node people ;)
[09:20:40] <timmywil> I think we should assume that it is
[09:20:43] <rwaldron> there is no way to tell the difference between a property, added via data(), called "foo42" and a property called "data-foo-42" (which is supposed to be left alone, but I don't know if it was always like that)
[09:20:47] <DaveMethvin> browsers are a very different env from node, tho
[09:21:23] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron i think what gnarf was advocating is that data-foo-42 should be left as "foo-42"?
[09:21:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: That argument is endless with some people
[09:21:24] <rwaldron> s/property called/data attribute called/
[09:21:39] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yes, it should
[09:21:48] <rwaldron> but I don't think we can safely make that change
[09:22:10] <rwaldron> there may be code that already assumes data-foo-42 => foo42
[09:22:16] <DaveMethvin> as long as the only people screwed over by that are people who use .data() for getting data- properties with -NUMBER i am okay with it, as they surely are crazy :)
[09:22:31] <m_gol> the question of safety is diffucult but we are breaking compatibility from time to time
[09:22:45] <m_gol> AJAX will be rewritten and I'm sure we'd love to drop the old impl. one day
[09:22:55] <gibson042> we can be clear about it in both -migrate and the 1.12/2.2 upgrade guide
[09:22:56] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the change will have to happen on both branches
[09:22:56] <m_gol> then will be changed to match the spec once it finalizes
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> we have broken data- behavior so many times since we added it, there is no way anyone depends on the edge cases :)
[09:23:13] <rwaldron> we also have unit tests that this will break
[09:23:13] <m_gol> * then -> `then`, as in the promise method
[09:23:34] <gibson042> lol DaveMethvin
[09:24:10] <gibson042> we did it with .attr; now time for .data!
[09:24:47] <DaveMethvin> if we can do it under cover of standards compliance, at least we can reply with righteous indignation
[09:24:47] <m_gol> I don't think we'd like such a change for 2.1/1.11 but it doesn't mean it can't be ever done
[09:25:09] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ok
[09:25:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah, true, i think 1.12/2.2 is a good time for some breaking things
[09:25:24] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin have you looked at the data-as-expando patch?
[09:25:27] <timmywil> hooray computer
[09:25:38] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron no, but that would be another good 2.2 thing
[09:25:55] <rwaldron> I see you left one comment, but I assumed you wanted to spend more time
[09:26:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:26:14] <rwaldron> I was trying to minimize the number of non-data changes that were made
[09:26:24] <DaveMethvin> the holidays are coming up, that's when i get to catch up on things
[09:26:44] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron yeah i think thats good and we can layer other changes on top of it
[09:26:46] <rwaldron> leaving the manipulation and events optimizations to someone that's more familiar with those modules
[09:27:04] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: would you like me to make migrate available on bower?
[09:27:13] <rwaldron> one trac is up I will take that foo-42 patch
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> timmywil yea was just coming back to that
[09:27:23] <DaveMethvin> that would be good
[09:27:32] <rwaldron> I'll have gnarf do the 1.x patch
[09:27:34] <timmywil> ok, I just assigned myself to the existing issue
[09:27:40] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[09:27:49] <DaveMethvin> wait, timmywil, trac is up now?
[09:27:57] <timmywil> github issue
[09:27:58] <rwaldron> (was about to ask)
[09:28:00] <m_gol> nope
[09:28:03] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[09:28:04] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:28:33] <timmywil> added a link to the notes
[09:28:38] <DaveMethvin> alright, we've jumped around, lets see what is left
[09:29:05] <m_gol> I added one entry
[09:29:09] <DaveMethvin> browser updates, good one
[09:29:13] <m_gol> I feel it's too hard for us to to browser updates
[09:29:17] <DaveMethvin> definitely
[09:29:23] <DaveMethvin> we're always falling behind
[09:29:28] <m_gol> and currently all of them are outdated
[09:29:30] <DaveMethvin> but we're limited by browserstack
[09:29:36] <m_gol> and yes, I've checked - new versions are available
[09:29:44] <m_gol> IE11 is available, Chrome 30, Opera 17, Safari 7
[09:29:51] <DaveMethvin> is there any way to poll bs via an api and upgraded automatically?
[09:29:53] <m_gol> we also need iOS there
[09:30:07] <m_gol> no idea but that would be the best way :)
[09:30:10] <DaveMethvin> because doing it manually we're always way behind
[09:30:12] <m_gol> should be
[09:30:13] <m_gol> yeah
[09:30:24] <timmywil> So I think even with 1.x, publishing migrate to npm is unnecessary. I speculate that if you're someone who would include migrate with npm, you're probably up-to-date with API changes.
[09:30:35] <m_gol> timmywil: +1
[09:31:23] <DaveMethvin> wow that was probably one of those delayed messages
[09:31:34] <m_gol> gnarf Krinkle|detached could you chime in?
[09:31:40] <timmywil> hehe, actually no, now I just have a one track mind
[09:31:43] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:31:44] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:32:07] <m_gol> a delayed timmywil ;)
[09:32:43] <m_gol> ok, so we'd love to get these automatic updates with a couple of custom rules defining which versions we're really interested in
[09:32:55] <m_gol> which should just match what's on jquery.com/browser-support/
[09:33:14] <DaveMethvin> BrowserStack.ChromeVersions.slice(0,2)
[09:33:18] <m_gol> :)
[09:33:35] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[09:33:39] <m_gol> the same with Fx & Opera + Opera 12.lastX + Safari 5.1+ etc.
[09:33:57] <_markelog> m_gol: you probably should create ticket about it
[09:34:13] <_markelog> maybe on the bug tracker
[09:34:15] <_markelog> or in https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues
[09:34:29] <m_gol> _markelog: I don't have access there
[09:34:37] <m_gol> it's 404 for me
[09:34:40] <_markelog> well, you should :-)
[09:34:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah let me see why that is
[09:35:25] <m_gol> I was wondering where should I report infra issues a couple of times :)
[09:35:44] <_markelog> jquery-infrastructure also works :-)
[09:35:50] <m_gol> I wonder why it's 404, not 403
[09:36:15] <m_gol> _markelog: you mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery-infrastructure/issues?
[09:36:26] <DaveMethvin> i just added all core team
[09:36:27] <m_gol> or IRC? ;)
[09:36:31] <_markelog> maybe because you should not know about private repos
[09:36:32] <DaveMethvin> so refresh!
[09:36:34] <_markelog> IRC
[09:36:40] <m_gol> thx, I see it now
[09:36:46] <m_gol> ok, so I'll report the issue
[09:36:59] <DaveMethvin> i think 404 doesn't leak info, 403 lets you know it's there but you can't get it
[09:37:12] <_markelog> that's what i said :-)
[09:37:26] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah you did!
[09:37:30] <DaveMethvin> i ran off for a sec
[09:38:09] <DaveMethvin> okay, well once trac comes up, if everyone could look at the list and grab a few tickets ... that would be great
[09:38:37] <_markelog> there couple things i wanted to talk about
[09:38:47] <_markelog> a while ago i heard there was some plans for reintroducing requestAnimationFrame
[09:38:51] <_markelog> those plans still exist?
[09:39:16] <DaveMethvin> it could be in 1.12/2.2 i guess if we wanted to break things
[09:39:25] <_markelog> i heard some concernes about it, like from Paul Lewis
[09:39:29] <_markelog> or from Julian :-)
[09:39:34] <_markelog> Like "Why they do not use requestAnimationFrame?! It's so cool and stuff"
[09:39:37] <m_gol> from what I understood it would be extremely difficult to do with the current model
[09:39:52] <timmywil> gotta run to a lunch meeting, bbl
[09:39:58] <m_gol> so it would have to be a new effects module
[09:40:08] <DaveMethvin> i don't know if we ever published a page explaining why, but it's pretty simple to come up with a page that breaks
[09:40:11] <_markelog> I have a thought about it, right now just a thought
[09:40:11] <_markelog> how about new method, say "raf" method
[09:40:11] <_markelog> which would have the same signature like animate does, with two difference:
[09:40:20] <_markelog> 1) it would use requestAnimationFrame if possible
[09:40:26] <_markelog> if user would use this method, instead of animate, he would know what problems he would encounter
[09:40:30] <_markelog> if it would be covered in our documentation
[09:40:55] <m_gol> would it work OK with multiple rafs running on the page?
[09:41:01] <DaveMethvin> there's already gnarf's plugin to insert raf though, so if anyone wants it they can get it
[09:41:16] <m_gol> true
[09:41:16] <_markelog> yeah, but it replaces the timer
[09:42:05] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, if we are introducing new api surface i'd like to do something more ambitious! :)
[09:42:20] <DaveMethvin> kind of like $.xhr
[09:42:20] <_markelog> 2) it could accept string as a first argument, the string would represent shorcut for animation methods like "slideDown", "fadeIn", etc
[09:42:25] <_markelog> if name of the method passed, then "raf" would became a decorator for that method like
[09:42:30] <_markelog> $().raf( "slideDown", "slow" );
[09:43:08] <_markelog> it should not take a lof of code to implement
[09:43:13] <DaveMethvin> a lot of those may map directly to css transitions though, which would be even better?
[09:43:21] <_markelog> yeah
[09:43:30] <_markelog> there is another choise
[09:43:37] <_markelog> implement "transition" methd
[09:43:42] <_markelog> or something like that
[09:43:50] <_markelog> which would have a different api
[09:44:01] <_markelog> and would use transitionы
[09:44:04] <_markelog> transitions
[09:44:13] <DaveMethvin> that's what i mean about new api surface ... and of course those coudl be plugins most likely to start
[09:44:14] <m_gol> completely different; way more efficient but less controllable
[09:44:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's all the flexibility of .animate() that makes it hard to map to transitions
[09:44:44] <_markelog> we could look at existing plugins
[09:45:05] <_markelog> or we could do both :-)
[09:45:09] <m_gol> all of these plugins do nasty stuff like forcing layout
[09:45:15] <m_gol> which is necessary, unfortunately
[09:45:24] <m_gol> bc transitions are really made for CSS, not JS :/
[09:45:31] <DaveMethvin> i don't know that forcing layout is, although causing them is
[09:46:03] <m_gol> it's necessary if you want to transition from 0 to auto
[09:46:06] <DaveMethvin> i think this would be good for a 1.12/2.2 discussion, we should plan for one
[09:46:21] <DaveMethvin> how about next month? will people be around over the holidays?
[09:46:26] <_markelog> i will
[09:46:43] <m_gol> though the fact it's necessary is caused by the fact it's hard to sensibly specify sth like that so it would be hard for us as well
[09:46:49] <m_gol> I will as well
[09:47:29] <_markelog> and another one little thing
[09:47:49] <_markelog> i talked about removing this code before
[09:47:55] <_markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a5037cb9e3851b171b49f6d717fb40e59aa344c2/src/core.js#L290-296
[09:47:58] <_markelog> but did not do it
[09:48:03] <_markelog> how about know?
[09:48:07] <_markelog> now
[09:48:30] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg suggested always using <script> tags
[09:48:52] <DaveMethvin> oh wrong spot
[09:49:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i think that shoudl be removed
[09:49:03] <m_gol> that would be more future-proof
[09:49:22] <_markelog> in beta3, or the next one?
[09:49:27] <DaveMethvin> i really dislike the whole idea of us doing this magic
[09:49:51] <DaveMethvin> i forget, when was this put in? it's not that long ago so it shouldn't be a lot of people depending on it
[09:50:01] <_markelog> in 2.0 rewrite
[09:50:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's take it out for beta3
[09:50:29] <_markelog> okay, will commit it shortly
[09:50:35] <m_gol> btw
[09:50:41] <m_gol> about use strict
[09:50:51] <m_gol> I'd love to see a list of obstacles
[09:51:05] <m_gol> because we really should be using it as soon as those crappy tools stop being crappy
[09:51:27] <_markelog> m_gol: not sure if i'm following you
[09:51:49] <m_gol> I'd love for jQuery to be in strict mode again once it's possible
[09:51:57] <DaveMethvin> the main obstacle is that use strict is lexical but it still affects the dynamic call chain
[09:52:06] <DaveMethvin> so all code in the project needs to be strict-aware
[09:52:14] <DaveMethvin> and there is still plenty of code that is not
[09:52:30] <_markelog> for ref
[09:52:30] <_markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/dc649a33e081c7beb083b04956731aa410eb6b3f/src/intro.js#L40
[09:52:59] <m_gol> _markelog: yeah, but your link is about tools
[09:53:11] <m_gol> and DaveMethvin means actual client-side code, right?
[09:53:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah, although i am not convinced it works right in a node env either
[09:53:59] <m_gol> we won't be able to avoid it forever anyway, we'll want to switch to ES6 modules one day which are implicitly strict
[09:54:11] <DaveMethvin> v8 would need to maintain a non-strict call stack for the sake of anything that may not be in strict
[09:54:16] <DaveMethvin> firefox currently doesn't do that
[09:54:21] <_markelog> ES6 modules wow, it's way way down the road
[09:54:37] <m_gol> in 3-4 years maybe :P
[09:54:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah, tell your grandchildren about it :)
[09:55:08] <m_gol> still, it's better to be proactive
[09:55:11] <DaveMethvin> please grandpa m_gol, i want to go outside and play on my hoverboard!
[09:55:16] <m_gol> :P
