[09:01:55] <arschmitz> snover: jdalton: jrossi9billion: meeting time
[09:02:07] <jdalton> woo
[09:02:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: cant make it this week he is recovering
[09:03:17] <arschmitz> jdalton: your still waiting on scott_gonzalez to review the functional tests right?
[09:04:54] <jdalton> yap but adding them as I go, didn't work on it this week though (short week, I'm technically oof now :P)
[09:06:40] <arschmitz> jdalton: cool it might be a while im not sure when scott will be back around hes pretty banged up
[09:06:54] <arschmitz> hopefully some time next week
[09:07:22] <arschmitz> Iv looked over them and they seem good to me but he wrote the POC for that
[09:07:25] <jdalton> banged up?
[09:07:30] <jdalton> he get into an accident?
[09:09:49] <arschmitz> Yeah he got hit by somone on the interstate monday
[09:10:11] <arschmitz> on his way to work
[09:11:04] <gtjrossi> yikes, that sucks
[09:11:29] <arschmitz> Yeah hes ok but car is totaled and hes pretty banged up
[09:12:05] <snover> :(
[09:14:27] <gtjrossi> good to hear he's alright though
[09:14:52] <arschmitz> yup just very stiff sore and in some pain still
[09:16:47] <gtjrossi> I plan to merge steditor's web-platform-test submission: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1949
[09:17:20] <arschmitz> sweet
[09:17:43] <gtjrossi> that would unblock PEP PR #168 https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/168
[09:17:51] <gtjrossi> though it looks like it's not passing the build at the moment
[09:19:16] <arschmitz> gtjrossi: the build does not pass on master
[09:19:27] <arschmitz> gtjrossi: I blame IE
[09:19:46] <arschmitz> oh this has a lot more failures then master though
[09:20:12] <gjtrossi> yeah i haven't looked into what's going on with it yet
[09:20:54] <arschmitz> ok
[09:21:29] <arschmitz> jdalton: how are you injecting the touch-action attribute into the w3c pages right now?
[09:21:55] <arschmitz> oh guess he is not here any more
[09:22:25] <gjtrossi> it says i quit... totally didn't
[09:22:33] <snover> ghost!
[09:22:47] <gjtrossi> had connectivity issues, maybe freenode is wacko today
[09:26:12] <arschmitz> maybe
[09:26:25] <arschmitz> jdalton: your back how are you injecting the touch-action attribute into the w3c pages right now?
[09:27:25] <jdalton> I'm not at the moment (I can though) I've skipped touch tests as Chrome driver complains about missing that functionality
[09:27:32] <jdalton> *to simulate touch
[09:30:23] <arschmitz> ok yeah we will need that eventually because thats how we determin what elements to listen on / dispatch events for
[09:30:46] <arschmitz> jdalton: but the reason i asked is because we are switching to using the style attribute with the touch-action property within it
[09:31:27] <jdalton> making modifications to the w3c test files is easy enough
[09:31:38] <jdalton> I already do it for injecting scripts
[09:32:25] <arschmitz> jdalton: it might require parsing css
[09:32:54] <arschmitz> i need to look how are the tests setting touch-action currently in a style tag style attribute or separate style sheet?
[09:33:15] <jdalton> I'm not sure
[09:33:33] <arschmitz> because we need it to be 100% style attribute
[09:36:02] <arschmitz> so far the only one i found is stye attribute already
[09:36:05] <arschmitz> might luck out
[09:36:31] <arschmitz> nope many are style tags
[09:37:18] <gjtrossi> yeah, definitely lots of style tags
[09:37:29] <arschmitz> jdalton: so you will have to parse the style tags and apply it to the elements that match the selector
[09:38:59] <jdalton> that's cool.
[09:39:12] <gjtrossi> some of the tests also dynamically change the touch-action value from script
[09:39:22] <gjtrossi> so you'll want to check how they're doing that (I imagine it's style attr)
[09:39:41] <arschmitz> gjtrossi: yeah thats will be troublesome
[09:39:58] <arschmitz> because if they do element.style[ touch-action ] = none
[09:40:04] <arschmitz> there is no way we can make that work
[09:40:17] <arschmitz> in browsers that dont support touch action
[09:40:44] <gjtrossi> that doesn't trigger the mutation observer?
[09:41:08] <arschmitz> not really
[09:41:17] <arschmitz> because if its invalid
[09:41:21] <arschmitz> it throws it away
[09:41:32] <arschmitz> so you have no idea what it ever was to begin with
[09:41:39] <arschmitz> or what it was trying to be changed to
[09:41:56] <arschmitz> depending on if it was originally set or not
[09:42:03] <gjtrossi> but you know the final value, isn't that all that's necessary?
[09:42:13] <arschmitz> no you dont know the final thats the problem
[09:42:32] <arschmitz> if style was undefined
[09:42:58] <arschmitz> and then they do element.style[ "touch-action" ] = "none"
[09:43:16] <arschmitz> the begining and end style attribute values will both be undefined
[09:45:34] <arschmitz> gjtrossi: because the browser constructs the string value dynamicly when you set a single prop like that and throws away anything invalid
[09:45:35] <gjtrossi> ah I gotcha
[09:45:56] <gjtrossi> clearly showing that I've used mutation observers like twice before :-)
[09:46:12] <arschmitz> gjtrossi: well this is a special thing to the style property
[09:46:24] <gjtrossi> can we wrap the style prop's setter?
[09:46:38] <gjtrossi> at least for the purposes of running web-platform-tests
[09:46:39] <arschmitz> hmm i had not thought of that
[09:46:47] <arschmitz> maybe?
[09:47:17] <arschmitz> it seems doable
[09:47:30] <jdalton> yess yesssssss I like this
[09:47:44] <gjtrossi> jdalton: if we do this, do you have a mechanism for synthesizing the touch input?
[09:48:23] <jdalton> I can create a touch even and trigger it (not sure why the Chrome driver has issues with it) maybe there's some gotcha I don't know about
[09:48:52] <gjtrossi> yeah, there is :-(
[09:49:40] <gjtrossi> if you create and fire touch events of down, move, up at a page, it doesn't trigger scrolling/zooming
[09:49:47] <gjtrossi> so you're not actually testing touch-action
[09:50:03] <gjtrossi> in fact, you'd probably fail some tests because you wouldn't cause scrolling
[09:50:26] <arschmitz> we also dont do everything native touch action does
[09:50:48] <arschmitz> like we dont prevent a lot of the native actions
[09:51:09] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/211
[09:51:46] <jdalton> if it's not testable we can always punt until it can be (do you know if IE/Edge Web Driver support has touch?)
[09:52:18] <gjtrossi> the Web Driver spec's support for touch is still in flux... nobody supports it AFAIK
[09:52:37] <arschmitz> there are some tests we just wont be able to run for some of the touch-action stuff i think
[09:52:37] <gjtrossi> lately, we've been contemplating a separate tool just for this purpose
[09:53:04] <arschmitz> jdalton: well also pep is a noop on IE / Edge :-)
[09:53:08] <gjtrossi> it's on our web driver team's backlog, but not sure if/when they'll get to it
[09:53:23] <gjtrossi> suppose you'd want to TEST it's a noop? :-p
[09:53:44] <arschmitz> gjtrossi: we actually fail on IE right now because its a noop
[09:53:59] <arschmitz> the internals dont get spun up and the unit tests test for them
[09:54:07] <arschmitz> :-/
[09:54:26] <jdalton> lol maybe we should pull them from the automated tests? Currently PEP attempts IE per commit I believe
[09:54:51] <arschmitz> jdalton: yes its on the todo to remove / fix those tests
[09:54:57] <arschmitz> just no one has got to it yet
[09:55:10] <jdalton> *I donno why but I totally spaced on the fact that it's a noop
[09:55:18] <jdalton> ah ok cool
[09:55:21] <arschmitz> they are leftovers from when this was part of polymer
[09:56:12] <arschmitz> so thats all i had for today
[09:56:36] <arschmitz> i have not got to switching the touch-action attribute yet
[09:57:44] <gjtrossi> alrighty, ttfn
[09:57:54] <jdalton> woot woot
[09:58:09] <arschmitz> see everyone in #pep or next week
[11:01:18] <arschmitz> cgack: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: sfrisk: agcolom: apsdehal: Meeting time
[11:01:40] <sfrisk> I'll be around, but pretty wrapped up with work today
[11:01:53] <arschmitz> sfrisk: any progress on accordion?
[11:01:54] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:02:03] <sfrisk> Nope, this week has been a bit nuts
[11:02:09] <arschmitz> ok
[11:02:17] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[11:02:30] <sfrisk> However, I actually have a free weekend this weekend :-D
[11:02:38] <arschmitz> sfrisk: cool
[11:02:43] <gabrielschulhof> I can echo sfrisk's situation :/
[11:02:57] <cgack> heyo
[11:04:09] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=1690822666
[11:05:15] <arschmitz> ok first up listview
[11:05:19] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof:  any update?
[11:06:35] <gabrielschulhof> Unfortunately none.
[11:06:44] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: same with loader?
[11:06:54] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. I had 0 time this week.
[11:07:01] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ok
[11:07:02] <gabrielschulhof> ... but IIRC loader was pretty close.
[11:07:13] <arschmitz> its ready it just needs to be merged and rebased
[11:07:19] <gabrielschulhof> Wait!
[11:07:22] <gabrielschulhof> It's landed.
[11:07:29] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[11:07:39] <gabrielschulhof> Well, at least it's not among my PRs anymore.
[11:07:48] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, yeah, now I remember. It's landed.
[11:07:52] <arschmitz> ok
[11:08:17] <gabrielschulhof> b92c8c4af63f6541932bdf29d466f3812271a933
[11:08:29] <arschmitz> cool
[11:08:29] <gabrielschulhof> ... and I just rebased listview.
[11:08:32] <arschmitz> ok
[11:08:53] <arschmitz> i submitted a PR for pagecontainer
[11:09:07] <arschmitz> needs someone to review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8261
[11:09:30] <gabrielschulhof> I'll take a look.
[11:10:08] <arschmitz> collapsible is waiting on a review too
[11:10:10] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8255
[11:10:43] <arschmitz> as well as the page visibility one
[11:11:36] <arschmitz> so if anyone has time to do some reviewing
[11:11:37] <jasperdegroot> I will look into that one
[11:11:59] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thank you
[11:12:28] <arschmitz> im almost done with the splitting up of navigation and helpers
[11:12:33] <arschmitz> and folder re-org
[11:12:45] <arschmitz> the split up is done just re-organizing the folders
[11:14:08] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: so when i land this there are also some semi big changes to controlgroup
[11:14:30] <jasperdegroot> why is that?
[11:14:32] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: each item now gets a ui-controlgroup-item class wich is used for the styling in ui
[11:14:48] <arschmitz> and there is now a label item
[11:14:57] <arschmitz> which is like a button you cant click lol
[11:15:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: realized we needed to support spinner which led to this
[11:16:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: and things like textinputs and spinners will need to be able to have labels to be able to have any idea what they are for usability wise
[11:16:44] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:17:09] <jasperdegroot> but where to put the label when it's inside a controlgroup?
[11:17:25] <arschmitz> immeditly before the input
[11:17:41] <jasperdegroot> should it become like a textinput and label inside a div styled as button
[11:17:43] <jasperdegroot> ?
[11:17:56] <jasperdegroot> but it is not actually a clickable button
[11:18:00] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no i just made a special item ui-controlgroup-label
[11:18:23] <arschmitz> add that class to an element and it treats it as its own thing
[11:18:32] <arschmitz> and controlgroup includes its own special style for it too
[11:18:40] <jasperdegroot> yes
[11:18:48] <jasperdegroot> was just wondering what that style should be
[11:19:02] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/blob/button-fixup/themes/base/controlgroup.css
[11:19:18] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: in ui i went with the same background color as the input
[11:19:21] <arschmitz> rather then the button
[11:19:33] <arschmitz> so that they are better visually associated
[11:19:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i also change the border between
[11:19:52] <jasperdegroot> is there a demo for this in the a branch?
[11:19:59] <arschmitz> yes
[11:20:03] <jasperdegroot> UI* branch
[11:20:40] <arschmitz> https://rawgit.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/button-fixup/demos/controlgroup/default.html
[11:20:58] <arschmitz> oh i guess i switched back on the backgound
[11:21:23] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:21:41] <arschmitz> so on the horizontal i remove the border completely
[11:21:49] <arschmitz> and on the vertical i just make it thinner
[11:22:02] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: for me to be able to work on this we first need to update that textinput demo on the controlgroup demo page
[11:22:11] <jasperdegroot> to make it extend the widget like you said
[11:22:26] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup ill take care of that
[11:22:33] <jasperdegroot> awesome
[11:23:11] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: this is not in 1.5-dev yet
[11:23:18] <arschmitz> just giving you a heads up
[11:23:28] <jasperdegroot> yeah, i understand
[11:23:29] <jasperdegroot> thanks
[11:23:54] <arschmitz> i like the horizontal style a lot better then the vertical
[11:24:22] <arschmitz> the spinner buttons are a pain visually
[11:24:26] <arschmitz> in the vertical
[11:25:37] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I would give the label a bit smaller font size
[11:25:49] <jasperdegroot> to differentiate it from button text
[11:26:16] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ill try that
[11:26:51] <jasperdegroot> now the label looks more like another control
[11:27:42] <jasperdegroot> 80% font-size looks better i think
[11:27:43] <arschmitz> hmm will have to adjust padding that makes it shorter changing its font size
[11:27:45] <arschmitz> but anyway
[11:28:50] <jasperdegroot> ok i will look into it when that branch has been merged and the textinput demo has been updated
[11:29:22] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sounds good thank you
[11:31:05] <arschmitz> apsdehal: is having internet issues
[11:31:12] <arschmitz> so no updates on the testing pr's
[11:31:27] <arschmitz> so i think thats all i have for this week
[11:31:40] <jasperdegroot> i saw you megred 1.5-css-and-demos
[11:31:41] <jasperdegroot> thanks
[11:31:49] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: oh yup
[11:32:05] <jasperdegroot> will start working on the various demos issues (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8245)
[11:32:32] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: execlent
[11:32:37] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: feel free to ping me
[11:33:01] <jasperdegroot> I'll start with markup/css of the buttons in the header and the quick links
[11:36:03] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sounds good
[11:37:23] <jasperdegroot> ok later all
[11:37:28] <gabrielschulhof> L8R
