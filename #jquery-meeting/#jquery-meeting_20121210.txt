[09:00:18] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:01:02] <rwaldron> hi!
[09:01:02] <DaveMethvin> yay
[09:01:13] <DaveMethvin> looks like we may have a small group today
[09:01:27] <DaveMethvin> but lots getting done so i'm happy!
[09:02:11] <rwaldron> I just pushed some sassy updates to gibson042's each/map refactor
[09:02:11] <DaveMethvin> so on jQuery.merge, we really can sub core_push?
[09:02:17] <rwaldron> suuuure can
[09:02:18] <rwaldron> :D
[09:02:23] <DaveMethvin> wow, works on oldIE??
[09:02:43] <rwaldron> push has been variable arity since pre-ES1
[09:02:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but that doesn't mean oldIE works :D
[09:03:18] <DaveMethvin> no better way than to test it
[09:03:18] <rwaldron> it does
[09:03:19] <rwaldron> :)
[09:03:26] <DaveMethvin> hokay
[09:03:37] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: you around?
[09:03:45] <timmywil> yupper
[09:03:50] <DaveMethvin> peachy!
[09:04:07] <DaveMethvin> so i's still like to get a beta out this week
[09:04:21] <DaveMethvin> we need to land that stricter interpretation of $(html)
[09:04:30] <DaveMethvin> lemme find the ticket, i think you own it tim
[09:04:37] <DaveMethvin> mywil
[09:04:40] <rwaldron> haha
[09:05:03] <DaveMethvin> bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11290
[09:05:29] <DaveMethvin> so, we tried landing this a while back
[09:05:44] <DaveMethvin> basically i think the test was "starts with <"
[09:06:25] <DaveMethvin> if we could just do selector.charAt(0)==="<" that would be fast
[09:06:39] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice to avoid a regexp or .trim() for that case
[09:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> :contains() ?
[09:07:01] <DaveMethvin> contains?
[09:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> :contains("<")
[09:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind.
[09:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> .charAt(0)
[09:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> ignore me
[09:08:31] <DaveMethvin> so would it be too strict to ignore whitespace there?
[09:08:51] <DaveMethvin> for literal strings you should never have it $("<p>aha</p>")
[09:09:07] <DaveMethvin> for processed tempates you might but it would be much preferable to use $.parseHTML for those
[09:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> Might want to deprecate it first. I'm sure it's going to break stuff.
[09:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming we support leading whitespace for HTML now.
[09:09:41] <DaveMethvin> this was discussed in the 1.8 notes
[09:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> In that case I think it's fine.
[09:09:58] <DaveMethvin> well it's funny, we allow it but don't turn it into text nodes
[09:10:05] <DaveMethvin> so it's thrown away
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> i expect that it will break code
[09:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> $() can be strict about what it considers HTML when $.parseHTML() is available, so +1 on .char(0) === "<"
[09:10:49] <timmywil> easy enough to ignore whitespace
[09:10:53] <DaveMethvin> someone will be depending on it in some strange way
[09:11:08] <DaveMethvin> it is, but if they have whitespace they are probably processing arbitrary html
[09:11:17] <DaveMethvin> not a literal few elements
[09:12:00] <timmywil> it's technically an invalid selector anyway
[09:12:39] <timmywil> because the space character means something, but we trim regardless
[09:13:13] <DaveMethvin> let's try the stricter defn and see what breaks
[09:13:17] <DaveMethvin> that's what the beta is for
[09:14:00] <timmywil> ok
[09:14:01] <DaveMethvin> my goal in getting a beta out early is to smoke out problems, we have almost a month before our target release date
[09:14:13] <DaveMethvin> so we can strategically retreat if needed :D
[09:15:15] <DaveMethvin> i need to make a note about the compat plugin there
[09:15:57] <DaveMethvin> ok, type attribute
[09:16:03] <DaveMethvin> timmywil i know you had concerns about htis
[09:16:14] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to be consistent across 1.9 and 2.0
[09:17:14] <DaveMethvin> we already document that it can't be done, this wouldn't break any existing code
[09:17:30] <DaveMethvin> it would just let new code do it where possible, and the user can try/catch or avoid doing it
[09:18:23] <DaveMethvin> imma grab that ticket and land it
[09:19:08] <DaveMethvin> just looking through what's here to see ones that need to land
[09:19:25] <DaveMethvin> thoughts on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12336
[09:19:27] <DaveMethvin> ?
[09:19:31] <rwaldron> Maybe we can get the Wordpress guys to roll it out to their hosted sites
[09:19:42] <DaveMethvin> gulp !
[09:19:44] <rwaldron> (the private dev zone)
[09:19:51] <DaveMethvin> it would have to be with the compat plugin
[09:19:53] <DaveMethvin> i suspect
[09:19:56] <rwaldron> and let us know what, if anything, breaks
[09:20:02] <rwaldron> yeah, that's fine
[09:20:10] <DaveMethvin> but knowing what warnings they got woudl be useful
[09:20:57] <DaveMethvin> on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12336 it's easy enough to fix, just ugly
[09:21:11] <DaveMethvin> hell why not
[09:21:36] <gibson042> it'll be gone soon anyway *shrugs*
[09:21:36] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:21:51] <DaveMethvin> gibson042! didn't realize you coudl make it
[09:22:05] <gibson042> meeting cancelled; I just jumped in
[09:22:08] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13021 will be fixed by your pull
[09:22:11] <DaveMethvin> yay
[09:22:57] <DaveMethvin> let's go to the pull requsts
[09:23:01] <gibson042> I think it'd be fair to call it rwaldron's pull now
[09:23:10] <DaveMethvin> sharing is caring
[09:23:50] <timmywil> sry, had to step away a sec
[09:24:11] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1067
[09:24:21] <DaveMethvin> this is our one real big feature
[09:24:37] <DaveMethvin> pretty useful actually to be able to get multiple css in one go
[09:25:11] <DaveMethvin> it costs some bytes but hey, we saved a lot via several other things
[09:25:36] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1066
[09:26:22] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: it seems inevitable that we're not gonna be able to paper over some of these problems in oldIE but we have different ones if we leave this in
[09:26:39] <gibson042> yeah
[09:26:43] <DaveMethvin> ROCKjQueryHARD PLACE lol
[09:26:52] <timmywil> gibson042: looks like you did the work for the boolHook, but is your point that boolean selectors can't work in old ie?
[09:27:04] <gibson042> basically
[09:27:27] <gibson042> IE6-7 don't differentiate attribute and prop AT ALL in these cases, as far as I can tell
[09:27:43] <DaveMethvin> mainly it's a question of whether we make things worse or break stuff that people currently have working
[09:27:56] <timmywil> gibson042: well, the problem is that we need to translate in places
[09:28:07] <DaveMethvin> there will be the compat plugin if needed
[09:28:16] <timmywil> [checked] === .defaultChecked
[09:28:34] <gibson042> if you look at see ?11115, you'll see how ugly it is
[09:28:37] <gibson042> aaaaah
[09:28:37] <bot-t> gibson042, 11115 - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 10 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11115
[09:28:56] <gibson042> shoot, this might work after all then
[09:29:35] <DaveMethvin> if there's a cleaner way to do it without breaking code, that would be great
[09:29:58] <gibson042> .defaultChecked may make all the difference in the world
[09:30:36] <DaveMethvin> does .defaltChecked get changed if the attribute is set?
[09:30:43] <timmywil> .defaultValue, .defaultChecked, and .defaultSelected
[09:30:45] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: no
[09:30:50] <timmywil> well, the first time
[09:31:12] <DaveMethvin> settable ONCE, where have i heard that :D
[09:31:13] <timmywil> the point is defaultChecked reflects the checked attribute
[09:31:27] <timmywil> not the checked proeprty
[09:31:34] <DaveMethvin> unless the attribute is changed
[09:31:39] <DaveMethvin> or removed?
[09:31:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'm not sure what you're asking
[09:32:23] <timmywil> ohhh, I'm only thinking about selectors
[09:32:25] <DaveMethvin> <input type=checkbox checked=checked>    $("input").removeAttr("checked")   what is .defaultChecked?
[09:32:33] <timmywil> yes, setting may have some quirks
[09:32:39] <timmywil> but I think we can work them out
[09:32:49] <DaveMethvin> ok, worth some more digging then
[09:33:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: but to answer you're question, it should end up being false
[09:33:21] <DaveMethvin> that would be good
[09:33:30] <DaveMethvin> if it tracks the attr
[09:33:49] <DaveMethvin> okay, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1065
[09:34:03] <DaveMethvin> where does orkel find these! :P
[09:34:20] <timmywil> and the dynamic state should not be affected. There may be exceptions like if it's disconnected.
[09:34:36] <timmywil> anyway
[09:34:38] <DaveMethvin> if it works everywhere and has consistent semantics let's land this
[09:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's consistent.
[09:35:44] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1063
[09:36:29] <DaveMethvin> this one looks good to me
[09:36:36] <gibson042> timmywil should this one use defaultValue?
[09:36:56] <DaveMethvin> oh, hmmm
[09:37:19] <timmywil> gibson042: the attrHook for oldIe probably needs to yea
[09:38:10] <gibson042> see, I *thought* it was all set until you pointed out default*!
[09:38:11] <DaveMethvin> as long as the .defaultValue really follows the attr that would simplify things
[09:38:24] <DaveMethvin> who invited timmywil? :P
[09:39:08] <DaveMethvin> while we're on the topic...
[09:39:34] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12577
[09:39:52] <DaveMethvin> some stupid ie10 bug seems to be triggered by assigning to the ret.value of the attribute node
[09:40:01] <DaveMethvin> but only when in ie7 compat mode
[09:40:50] <DaveMethvin> but that's for the set, not the get i guess
[09:41:16] <timmywil> weird
[09:41:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah it may be something we can't really fix, imma talk to tony ross at ms about it
[09:41:41] <timmywil> I wonder if setting value instead of nodeValue would fix it
[09:42:22] <timmywil> "compatibility view" is like "break my shit" view
[09:42:22] <DaveMethvin> ie10 seems to be so full of bugs
[09:42:41] <DaveMethvin> especially when you consider it's not even released on windows 7 yet
[09:42:47] <DaveMethvin> not a good sign
[09:43:01] <DaveMethvin> but maybe they'll fix these and we don't have to wait for ie11
[09:44:33] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1051
[09:44:55] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately jaubourg couldn't be here to discuss
[09:45:11] <DaveMethvin> what's everyone else think? it still seems that this hook shoudl be in ajax
[09:45:34] <DaveMethvin> seems strange to me for ajax to patch a method in manipulation to remove a reference to something
[09:45:55] <gibson042> I think so too, but was hoping for the other ajax PR to land before making my case again
[09:45:57] <DaveMethvin> i guess it's somewhat of a dependency injection pattern but ...
[09:46:49] <DaveMethvin> anyone else with an opinion?
[09:47:38] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1027  timmywil did you see the perf test i posted for this one?
[09:47:41] <timmywil> just that jaubourg should weigh in before landing
[09:48:08] <DaveMethvin> not sure it's testing what I want
[09:48:21] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I did. I'd like to see a perf from jQuery's perspective
[09:48:35] <DaveMethvin> well you want to make one? :D
[09:48:51] <timmywil> yea, I meant to. sorry I haven't done that yet
[09:49:28] <DaveMethvin> any others in the pulls or tickets that ppl want to discuss?
[09:50:25] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1060
[09:50:46] <gibson042> is Krinkle here?
[09:50:52] <Krinkle> I am
[09:51:34] <gibson042> what's going on with ^ at the moment?
[09:51:39] <Krinkle> Neither mine nor jaubourg's version can be merged yet because they fail on jq03's configuration.
[09:52:02] <gibson042> damn
[09:52:03] <DaveMethvin> i figured jaubourg would get that ironed out with Krinkle, but i guess it needs gnarf to add his tender touch
[09:52:17] <Krinkle> For the rest, they're okay (mine goes on top of his, and then the result would be merged in core)
[09:52:36] <Krinkle> but neither can happen yet because that would put testswarm full of with 100% errors
[09:53:07] <Krinkle> something is up with the php-fpm/nginx configuration, but since I never use nginx nor php-fpm, I have no clue. I tried some basic debugging and loggic, but coulnd't figure it out
[09:53:22] <Krinkle> somehow the server is responding with an empty body for certain requests.
[09:53:35] <DaveMethvin> cool
[09:53:51] <Krinkle> always the same requests, which invalidate the test of course (expected content doesn't match)
[09:53:57] <DaveMethvin> we just need to figure that out then... :/
[09:54:02] <Krinkle> Yep
[09:54:54] <DaveMethvin> no doubt we could clean that up a bit more, i know gnarf had to make some config changes b/c of the strange things we did like posting to .html pages
[09:55:22] <DaveMethvin> and a standalone setup wont work with ngnix out of the box last i checked
[09:55:28] <DaveMethvin> for unit tests that it
[09:55:29] <DaveMethvin> is
[09:55:36] <DaveMethvin> okay, any others?
[09:56:15] <gibson042> hmmm; https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1047 ?
[09:57:00] <DaveMethvin> geez i thought i remembered why that one hadn't landed yet
[09:57:15] <gibson042> me too, but GitHub is a mess there
[09:57:38] <DaveMethvin> it got tangled up with unrelated stuff
[09:58:24] <DaveMethvin> lemme just ask him to put in a clean pull request
[09:58:29] <DaveMethvin> it will be better for history's sake
[09:58:35] <gibson042> good call
[09:59:02] <DaveMethvin> please do make whatever sloppy notes you'd like in the 1.9 upgrade guide so that we can document the heck out of what we are breaking, er, changing here
[09:59:15] <DaveMethvin> and with that, we're done?
[09:59:27] <gibson042> I've got nothing else
[09:59:30] <DaveMethvin> i'll be in -dev after i finish a short meeting at 1pm
[09:59:40] <DaveMethvin> ok see you in -dev!
[09:59:43] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys
