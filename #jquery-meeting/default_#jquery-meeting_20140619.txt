[11:01:22] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz gseguin gschulhof agcolom cgack
[11:03:05] <jasperdegroot> thanks gschulhof  :)
[11:03:09] <cgack> howdy
[11:03:09] <gschulhof> :)
[11:03:42] * gschulhof struts up and down showing off his brand-spanking-new nick
[11:04:02] <jasperdegroot> yeah, we might have to start with re-introducing ourselves :)
[11:04:06] <gschulhof> Snazzy, eh?
[11:04:14] <gschulhof> :)
[11:04:43] <jasperdegroot> <-- formerly known as uGoMobi
[11:05:03] <gschulhof> <-- formerly known as _|Nix|_
[11:06:33] <jasperdegroot> just the 3 of us?
[11:06:47] <arschmitz> no im here sorry i was muted when i said hellow
[11:06:54] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[11:06:58] <jasperdegroot> yeah, my bad
[11:07:12] <jasperdegroot> what's the status of the 1.4.3 release?
[11:07:22] <arschmitz> fixing bugs and tests still
[11:07:29] <arschmitz> we keep finding broken bits
[11:07:42] <jasperdegroot> yeah, I noticed
[11:07:53] <jasperdegroot> well, better find them now than after the release
[11:07:57] <arschmitz> better now then after though thats why we test
[11:08:02] <arschmitz> yup lol
[11:08:52] <jasperdegroot> I did some work on the ThemeRoller
[11:08:52] <gschulhof> So, I take it, casper will be a lot more agressive now, eh, while at the same time glossing over failures to retrieve the page from the server?
[11:09:00] <jasperdegroot> the add_version script didn't work anymore since 1.4.0 so I did releases manually
[11:09:54] <jasperdegroot> sorry, I was dc
[11:10:37] <gschulhof> IRC's a bit flaky now ...
[11:11:46] <gschulhof> Ping!
[11:11:49] <arschmitz> hi
[11:11:52] <agcolom> hi!
[11:11:53] <gschulhof> OK.
[11:11:55] <gseguin> hey
[11:12:02] <gschulhof> Until the next netsplit ...
[11:12:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: is also not able to talk for some reason i think
[11:12:29] <arschmitz> he sent me a message on hangouts
[11:12:38] <gschulhof> K, weird ...
[11:12:50] <gschulhof> Channel should be unmoderated
[11:13:01] <arschmitz> and he never left
[11:13:18] <gseguin> Shall we?
[11:13:25] <arschmitz> sure
[11:13:28] <gseguin> or do we want to wait for jasperdegroot
[11:13:29] <gseguin> ?
[11:13:31] <jasperdegroot> test 1 2 3
[11:13:35] <arschmitz> hello
[11:13:36] <agcolom> yes!
[11:13:40] <gschulhof> WB
[11:13:41] <gseguin> hey Jasper
[11:14:15] <arschmitz> hmm he says he still cant even though he just did lol
[11:14:29] <arschmitz> something weird be happening
[11:14:43] <gschulhof> He may not be receiving his words back.
[11:14:45] <jasperdegroot> and I am back :)
[11:15:08] <gschulhof> jasperdegroot: How do you read?
[11:15:08] <gschulhof> Gah!
[11:15:08] <arschmitz> DOH!
[11:15:26] <arschmitz> BAD IRC BAD!
[11:15:33] <gschulhof> Ummm ... I dunno ... hangout?
[11:15:37] <gschulhof> It need not be voice.
[11:15:46] <gschulhof> ... though that won't be logged :/
[11:15:47] <arschmitz> yeah but thats not public
[11:15:59] <gschulhof> No, no it's not :/
[11:16:02] <cgack> what is happening?
[11:16:17] <jasperdegroot> pfff
[11:16:18] <arschmitz> gschulhof: jasperdegroot is getting a huge delay i guess
[11:16:31] <gschulhof> cgack: Lotsa netsplits, and jasperdegroot can't talk for some reason.
[11:16:35] <arschmitz> cgack: 'THE ARE ALL SPLITTING!
[11:16:49] <arschmitz> nets*
[11:17:10] <gschulhof> The t00bs are leaking.
[11:17:56] <jasperdegroot> ?
[11:18:13] <jasperdegroot> this is not going to work
[11:18:22] <arschmitz> lol
[11:18:31] <arschmitz> it seems like it might have calmed down
[11:18:33] <gseguin> we can meet on hangouts if there is another netsplit
[11:19:12] <arschmitz> yeah might not have a choice
[11:19:35] <gschulhof> I sent jasperdegroot a CTCP ping and it's still not back.
[11:20:01] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yours returned in less than half a second.
[11:20:23] <jasperdegroot> there is a 5 minute delay :/
[11:20:32] <gschulhof> CTCP PING reply from jasperdegroot: 90.605 seconds
[11:20:38] <cgack> its been a good first 20 minutes so far
[11:20:43] <jasperdegroot> seems to be ok now
[11:21:07] <gschulhof> Yeah, looking better now.
[11:21:13] <jasperdegroot> how about gseguin and agcolom ?
[11:21:16] <gschulhof> So, where were we?
[11:21:28] <arschmitz> they are here
[11:21:29] <agcolom> all fine here
[11:21:30] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: I'm here
[11:21:32] <gschulhof> All under a sec.
[11:21:33] <jasperdegroot> ok great
[11:21:42] <jasperdegroot> yes, where were we?
[11:21:55] <gschulhof> Lots a minor breakage in 1.4.3.
[11:21:57] <jasperdegroot> I was saying I have been working on the ThemeRoller add_version script
[11:22:02] <gseguin> 1.4-stable is all ready for release
[11:22:13] <arschmitz> gschulhof: no its not
[11:22:15] <gschulhof> gseguin: Hold on. It needs to wait for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7518
[11:22:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: i mean
[11:22:28] <gschulhof> This ^gs.* isn't helping.
[11:22:37] <jasperdegroot> lol yeah
[11:22:39] <gseguin> I meant on the release script and release requirements
[11:22:53] <jasperdegroot> ok so we continue to fix those small bugs
[11:22:53] <gseguin> once the code changes are in we're good to go
[11:23:15] <gschulhof> Have we done the test release to make sure the demos end up kosher?
[11:24:34] <jasperdegroot> gseguin arschmitz ^^
[11:24:54] <arschmitz> i have not iv just been working on bugs and tests
[11:24:59] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:25:37] <gseguin> gschulhof: yes I did a test release this morning
[11:25:45] <gseguin> and addressed all the issues
[11:26:08] <jasperdegroot> no root inside the transitions folder anymore?
[11:26:23] <gschulhof> Cool!
[11:26:30] <arschmitz> gseguin: and make sure you check that in the cloned demos repo?
[11:29:02] <gseguin> arschmitz: I checked the demos in the __release directory
[11:29:11] <gseguin> transitions demos were working
[11:29:20] <arschmitz> gseguin: we need to make sure we check them in the cloned demos repo
[11:29:35] <arschmitz> it could be an issue with them being copied since it was recursion
[11:29:56] <gseguin> arschmitz: not sure what you're asking
[11:30:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: as part of the release we clone the demos repo
[11:30:26] <gseguin> oh I see
[11:30:27] <arschmitz> and we copy the demos from the mboile repo into there
[11:30:32] <gseguin> let me check that
[11:30:47] <arschmitz> because thats the very last step
[11:30:54] <arschmitz> after that its just git push
[11:31:32] <gseguin> re-running
[11:31:50] <jasperdegroot> yeah, we really need to test/check this thoroughly
[11:31:55] <jasperdegroot> not assume it will be ok
[11:32:02] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: ok, thanks
[11:33:06] <jasperdegroot> I will open a PR for the ThemeRoller tonight which needs to land before we can update the TR to 1.4.3
[11:33:27] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz and gschulhof I will ping you when it's there
[11:33:38] <jasperdegroot> for review
[11:33:44] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thank you
[11:34:34] <jasperdegroot> since we don't want to release on Friday we probably have to postpone the release to Monday
[11:35:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes i think so
[11:35:45] <jasperdegroot> anything else about 1.4.3?
[11:35:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: I confirm that the demos in __release/demos.jquerymobile.com are working
[11:36:03] <gseguin> especially the transitions one
[11:36:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: thank you
[11:36:12] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: great!
[11:37:08] <jasperdegroot> any updates about 1.5 development
[11:37:09] <jasperdegroot> ?
[11:37:21] <gschulhof> I pushed that fixed toolbar table demo.
[11:37:29] <gschulhof> I'm pretty much done with the basic review.
[11:37:49] <gschulhof> I'm sure there're a ton of things wrong with it, but it feels done.
[11:38:00] <gschulhof> I wanna compare performance to master next.
[11:38:27] <gschulhof> ... and I keep trying to simplify the code, but it's pretty difficult, what with all the extensions.
[11:39:31] <cgack> and I fixed a css issue with footers and navbar that was really wonky on firefox - started authoring some more tests but have not pushed them yet
[11:39:45] <jasperdegroot> ok great
[11:39:57] <jasperdegroot> we have been talking about accordion/collapsible during the week
[11:41:20] <jasperdegroot> as also discussed during last week's meeting we don't work on style option deprecation/removal for collapsible(set) until we decided about when to adopt UI's accordion
[11:41:46] <jasperdegroot> we have to update the roadmap a bit
[11:42:16] <jasperdegroot> the part about in what version we adopt a specific UI widget
[11:42:55] <gschulhof> Oh, my Intel mail's broken, so I can't follow up on that email about accordion and collapsible :/
[11:46:55] <jasperdegroot> sorry, I was dc again
[11:47:21] * agcolom gotta run to pick up Alex... see you in -dev
[11:47:26] <gschulhof> K L8R
[11:47:56] <jasperdegroot> anything else about 1.5?
[11:48:18] <gschulhof> arschmitz: You just realized that we're severly short on pagecontainer tests, right?
[11:48:24] <gschulhof> severely, even.
[11:48:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: yes pretty much
[11:48:43] <arschmitz> like esentially there are none
[11:49:21] <jasperdegroot> that doesn't sound good
[11:49:44] * gseguin thinks gschulhof should go change his handle back
[11:49:48] <gseguin> :D
[11:49:54] <arschmitz> though ironically it has a higher test coverage then the rest of the lib on average
[11:50:09] <arschmitz> 84% vs 82%
[11:50:57] <gschulhof> *facepalm*
[11:51:24] <arschmitz> yup its all just indirect through sequence tests and stuff
[11:51:36] <gschulhof> Well, those /are/ integration tests.
[11:51:48] <gschulhof> Wait!
[11:51:54] <jasperdegroot> does the "1.5 development" section in the agenda still cover all the things we want to work on for 1.5?
[11:52:00] <gschulhof> One thing we have to do is re-write all the tests in terms of non-deprecated events.
[11:52:20] <gschulhof> ... at that point, the tests will target pagecontainer more specifically.
[11:52:27] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yup
[11:52:31] <gschulhof> ... although they will remain integration tests.
[11:52:45] <gschulhof> ... and the fact that we test path pretty well also helps.
[11:52:49] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah we dont even have anything designed to test specific options or methods
[11:52:57] <arschmitz> but they all end up getting tested
[11:53:10] <gschulhof> Yes - for historical reasons.
[11:53:36] <arschmitz> i think in general for 1.5 a goal needs to be to clean up our tests
[11:54:01] <arschmitz> gschulhof: on this note i talked to jzaefferer about mockjax
[11:54:17] <arschmitz> gschulhof: he said its good and we should use it for sure
[11:54:25] <gschulhof>  Cool!
[11:54:40] <arschmitz> gschulhof: he uses it in his tests for validate
[11:54:51] <gschulhof> Excellent.
[11:55:02] <arschmitz> gschulhof: https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax
[11:55:29] <arschmitz> this should really make our tests bullet proof on travis
[11:55:33] <arschmitz> execpt the casper ones
[11:55:50] <arschmitz> and it should make the tests a lot faster
[11:55:51] <gschulhof> Yeah.
[11:55:56] <jasperdegroot> that would be awesome
[11:56:06] <arschmitz> 1ms response time on all nav ajax
[11:56:28] <gschulhof> One thing we have to make sure is that we preserve the level of asynchonicity.
[11:56:43] <arschmitz> gschulhof: 1ms
[11:56:47] <arschmitz> is async
[11:56:53] <gschulhof> ... though I think if mockjax is worth anything at all, it already does that.
[11:56:58] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that's cool.
[11:57:14] <arschmitz> gschulhof: you configure the response time
[11:57:22] <gschulhof> arschmitz: We should also try to remove any and all evil, arbitrary setTimeout()s from our code.
[11:57:45] <arschmitz> gschulhof: we have always avoided that where possible
[11:57:48] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yes, I know, it's great, but I'm thinking that if we set the response time too low, it will influence our behaviour.
[11:58:07] <arschmitz> gschulhof: what do you mean async is async
[11:58:16] <arschmitz> the time should not matter or we are doing something wrong
[11:58:19] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I'll never forget when johnbender said he died a little inside anytime anyone used that for a "legitimate" reason.
[11:58:44] <arschmitz> gschulhof: setTimeout( function(){}, 0 ) is 100% legit
[11:58:46] <gschulhof> arschmitz: It may matter if we unwind the stack.
[11:58:54] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yes, but that's just it.
[11:58:56] <arschmitz> gschulhof: 1ms is async
[11:59:00] <arschmitz> async is async
[11:59:02] <gschulhof> Yes, I know.
[11:59:23] <gschulhof> But if it's too soon, it may actually trade places with a setTimeout(, 0) in the real world.
[11:59:25] <arschmitz> a 1ms timeout is longer then a 0ms one
[11:59:37] <arschmitz> so it is always futher back in the stack
[11:59:45] <gschulhof> ... or does setTimeout(, 0) deterministically insert a frame right after the current one?
[11:59:53] <jasperdegroot> this is more a -dev discussion if you ask me
[12:00:48] <gschulhof> OK. All I'm saying is that, since we're gonna save massive amounts of time anyway, we shouldn't unnecessarily reduce response times.
[12:01:14] <jasperdegroot> anything else we need to discuss here?
[12:02:23] <gschulhof> I'm good.
[12:05:10] <arschmitz> just to mention
[12:05:20] <arschmitz> there is a pr for a css style guide if anyone is interested
[12:05:34] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/83
[12:09:33] <jasperdegroot> thanks all!
[12:09:37] <jasperdegroot> see you on -dev
