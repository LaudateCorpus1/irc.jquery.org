[12:00:38] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:22] <fnagel> hi
[12:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't get a chance to put the agenda together. Just one more minute.
[12:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's start.
[12:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> Our ticket and PR counts dropped a bit :-)
[12:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> Some PRs were merged, but a bunch were just closed due to inactivity or being a risky change to interactions.
[12:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> I left a few interaction PRs open that looked sane.
[12:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to review. If others have time, it'd be good to get more eyes on it.
[12:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> I also did some ticket triage, which is what made our ticket count drop.
[12:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> For spinner, we decided not to support Globalize 1.x in UI 1.12.
[12:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> I filed a PR to document that: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/307
[12:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> That was merged.
[12:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't deployed that yet though.
[12:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> But speaking of deploying the API site...
[12:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz got the main site showing the 1.12 docs.
[12:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> For position, we removed the fractional pixel detection.
[12:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1739
[12:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> This was only there for IE <= 9 and was causing problems in Chrome.
[12:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on removing the external directory from the CDN zip we send to Google and Microsoft.
[12:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> This crept in during the big release script update to use the new download builder packager.
[12:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> Google noticed it as part of the 1.12.0 release.
[12:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> I have a PR for adding a custom handle demo for slider: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1740
[12:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> Includes a bug fix discovered by jzaefferer when reviewing the demo.
[12:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> That PR needs another round of review.
[12:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> So, I think the only things remaining before the 1.12.1 release are:
[12:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> Slider PR for custom handle
[12:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> Remove externals directory from CDN zip
[12:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> Deploy the updated API docs
[12:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to add to that list?
[12:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:21:50] <arschmitz> we should also fix the bug you pinged on this morning
[12:21:55] <arschmitz> with themeroller
[12:22:12] <arschmitz> since i think that is really the lib
[12:22:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right. I meant to get that on the agenda.
[12:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:22:34] <arschmitz> i got distracted and didnt finish checking the deoms to mak sure that didnt break anything but i think i can just remove that line
[12:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> This is the bug: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/159
[12:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> The icons are getting the hover color by default.
[12:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> I believe it's caused by this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/6e2bbcaa5e19bb933d8024ff5d6fcff34f91e034#diff-ff24a972bba1a2ecf79314fd9a5d048fR208
[12:23:23] <arschmitz> yeah which makes no sense and that line even seems unrelated
[12:23:35] <arschmitz> to the rest of the commit\
[12:23:55] <arschmitz> i just need to make sure thats not beins used somewhere
[12:27:28] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[12:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep working on the release.
[12:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> If someone can review that slider PR, that'd be great.
[12:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
