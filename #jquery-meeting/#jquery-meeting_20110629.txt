[09:03:27] <danheberden> Hey felixge
[09:03:38] <felixge> danheberden: hi
[09:03:40] <danheberden> just an fyi if you didn't know, the ui room is #jqueryui-dev
[09:03:48] <danheberden> for like, non-meeting's 'n shit
[09:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's get started
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: infrastructure update?
[09:05:32] <danheberden> i updated code.jquery.com with 1.8.14, also added some text to direct users to available previous versions
[09:05:52] <danheberden> y'all know about download builder's issue getting fixed by jdsharp
[09:06:13] <danheberden> i hadn't heard anything and eddie has been invisible all week since last ui call
[09:06:25] <danheberden> so i did the code.jquery.com thing - i'll worry about a build script later
[09:06:50] <danheberden> I'm seeking out further help for the view.jqueryui.com listing
[09:06:57] <danheberden> from someone who's been already quite helpful
[09:07:01] <danheberden> (clarkbox)
[09:07:13] <danheberden> that's it for ui related
[09:07:14] <toddparker> hey guys
[09:07:24] <danheberden> sup toddparker
[09:07:28] <toddparker> sup
[09:07:41] <danheberden> oh and scott_gonzalez it was last week, but the hotlinking thing is fixzored
[09:07:50] <danheberden> after i made a fool of myself starting the ui meeting
[09:07:52] <danheberden> ... alone
[09:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: could we maybe just get a list of js + base themes for all versions?
[09:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> like: 1.8.13 (theme)
[09:08:44] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ya- do you think it'd be helpful?
[09:08:51] <danheberden> i mean - instead of just changing the version number in the url
[09:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> I think it helps with seeing what versions were released
[09:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> alphas, betas, rcs, etc.
[09:09:25] <danheberden> i wasn't planning on putting those in the cdn
[09:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> they exist for core and mobile
[09:09:36] <danheberden> but i see with 1.9 that'll be useful
[09:09:43] <danheberden> well - that's legacy scott_gonzalez
[09:09:47] <danheberden> like - didn't want to break old shit
[09:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> 1.6rc1 is legacy?
[09:10:02] <danheberden> oh i meant the old alphas
[09:10:08] <danheberden> that's what i meant for 1.9
[09:10:12] <danheberden> like - i see what you mean
[09:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I'm fine if we just have the 1.7 and 1.8 finals on there
[09:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> but listing them out would be good
[09:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really care about listing out all themes for all versions though
[09:10:56] <danheberden> ok - i'll continue to checkout a buildscript idea; upkeeping by hand blows
[09:11:04] <danheberden> ok
[09:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> just as long as it's easy to grab the URL for the js + base theme
[09:11:20] <danheberden> fair 'nuf
[09:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> if I've got access, I can do the manual stuff
[09:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just add it to the release process
[09:11:58] <danheberden> moving forward, sure
[09:12:20] <danheberden> i'll work to make that easier for ya
[09:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> anyone know anything about docs?
[09:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> Richard's not here
[09:13:30] <danheberden> i'm a bit out of the loop on anything he might have done in the past 2 weeks
[09:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> menu/menubar planning meeting: jzaefferer ?
[09:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> guess he's not here
[09:16:46] <danheberden> out galavanting around with grabanski i guess
[09:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> a few of us got together on some day (can't remember who or when)
[09:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> we covered most of the open issues
[09:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think we came up with new names for the methods like left and right
[09:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> I think it might've been open and collapse
[09:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think any code changes have occurred since the meeting
[09:18:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think it was the other way around left/right -> open/collapse
[09:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> but we've got some notes on the planning wiki
[09:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, stupid ambiguous wording
[09:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> new names for methods (methods like what used to be left and right)
[09:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> and I think the new names might've been open/collapse
[09:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> that's what I was trying to say :-P
[09:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: do you remember anything else from that meeting worth mentioning?
[09:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> it seems like so long ago
[09:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> even though it was less than two weeks ago
[09:20:10] <kborchers> just need to discuss supporting other markup for menu other than just ul/li
[09:20:34] <kborchers> also, i have added label support to the inputs piece
[09:20:47] <kborchers> updated link on wiki
[09:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:21:30] <scott_gonzalez> booo...no view.jqueryui.com support for forks :-P
[09:21:49] <danheberden> for forks?
[09:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> the label support is in kborchers' fork
[09:22:10] <danheberden> lol
[09:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> allowing arbitrary repos would obviously be a bad idea
[09:22:26] <kborchers> i have a fiddle here so that you can see it and let me know if i should change anything http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/38wcx/6/
[09:22:28] <danheberden> haha
[09:22:41] <kborchers> also on the wiki
[09:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> that menu is looking really slick
[09:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> has anyone done anything with selectmenu?
[09:24:06] <kborchers> yeah, rworth asked to use bullet instead of checked radio icon but they don't align :/ talked about adding icons.
[09:24:07] <gnarf> i asked about that once scott_gonzalez :)
[09:24:18] <gnarf> view.jqueryui.com on my fork would be nice ;)
[09:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: now that you're a committer, you can just branch and push to the branch to get view.jqueryui.com support
[09:25:11] <gnarf> true
[09:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok, moving on
[09:25:45] <danheberden> annnnnnd complete all of the pending ui projects
[09:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.14 was released :-)
[09:26:10] <danheberden> ?eval hi5( 'scott_gonzalez', 'danheberden' )
[09:26:11] <bot-t> danheberden: "scott_gonzalez _o/\o_ danheberden"
[09:26:29] <toddparker> @ kborchers - the radio and check menu items are great. nice work
[09:26:35] <kborchers> thanks
[09:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> we still haven't landed 1.6.1 in master
[09:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> haven't had time to look into the boolean ARIA attributes yet
[09:27:13] <danheberden> might as well update that to 1.6.2
[09:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> support for tabs outside of the tab container never got a valid use case (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7462)
[09:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> so unless someone has a really good reason why we should support this, we're going to continue to only support panels inside of the actual widget
[09:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> so that just leaves testing animations
[09:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> we'll find a good time to have a meeting about that
[09:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> but probably not before next week's meeting
[09:31:36] <danheberden> -1 on the tabs content outside of the container
[09:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers has a pull request for activating accordion panels during animation: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/368
[09:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> demo: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YpFfN/
[09:32:28] <danheberden> heh, that demo is simply fun
[09:32:35] <danheberden> weeeeeeeee
[09:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> the jump is a bit noticeable (more noticeable on longer animations and/or bounceslide), but I think it's probably good enough to land
[09:35:07] <scott_gonzalez> anyone have anything else?
[09:35:33] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez perhaps a status on download builder?
[09:35:43] <danheberden> since that seems to fall under ui?
[09:35:55] <danheberden> namely, i have no idea whats going on with it
[09:35:57] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right, the rewrite
[09:36:07] <danheberden> except that felixge is tracking some data
[09:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> or are you talking about the total failure?
[09:36:23] <danheberden> the rewrite
[09:36:29] <danheberden> what felixge is workign on
[09:36:39] <danheberden> nothing big - just a small status/whats going on
[09:36:43] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:36:57] <scott_gonzalez> felixge will be writing the new download builder in node
[09:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> he's adding some logging to the current download builder to capture some stats
[09:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> like how many builds we're generating and how long it takes
[09:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> he actually has that ready and we'll be pushing that to production today
[09:38:09] <danheberden> is the thought of themeroller interacting with it on the table at all?
[09:38:35] <danheberden> e.g. custom theme + selected components = zomg.zip
[09:38:53] <toddparker> that's what we do now
[09:39:03] <toddparker> but are we reducing scope for the re-write
[09:39:07] <felixge> danheberden: Step 1 is to rewrite the jquery ui build system and re-use that code in the download builder. I think theme roller integration will be done after that
[09:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> we'll probably have two components (download builder + themeroller) and then code to integrate them
[09:39:28] <danheberden> ok cool
[09:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we're also going to change our build process over to node
[09:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> no more ant
[09:39:54] <danheberden> wonderful
[09:39:55] <jzaefferer> hey guys, sorry for missing most of the meeting, timezone difference is messing everything up
[09:39:55] * gnarf cheers
[09:40:03] <scott_gonzalez> that way we can share code between the build process and download builder
[09:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> since they do a lot of the same stuff
[09:40:10] <danheberden> jzaefferer heh, figured you were partying too hard with marc
[09:40:21] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez that makes a great deal of sense
[09:40:22] <jzaefferer> we had a javascript BBQ yesterday /o\
[09:40:37] <jzaefferer> don't have much to add to menu/menubar, hadn't even seen a comment on the open/collapse stuff
[09:40:46] <jzaefferer> was that added to the wiki somewhere/
[09:40:47] <jzaefferer> ?
[09:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> no, it probably got missed in the note taking
[09:40:58] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez felixge toddparker thnx for getting me up to speed on that stuff
[09:41:17] <jzaefferer> there's a comment from Richard about expand/collapse
[09:41:56] <jzaefferer> is that the real deal? or is it open/collapse?
[09:42:30] <kborchers> i think we did think expand was better than open, just sounded better together
[09:42:51] <toddparker> ya, agree
[09:43:05] <toddparker> with kborchers
[09:44:28] <jzaefferer> kborchers, would you be interested in implemented expand/collapse in Menu and the autoExpand option for Menubar?
[09:44:38] <jzaefferer> *implementing
[09:44:47] <kborchers> sure
[09:44:52] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:45:27] <jzaefferer> would have to make sure that the current methods aren't referenced anywhere, or update those, too
[09:45:35] <kborchers> right
[09:45:51] <jzaefferer> autoExpand should also be easy to implement, needs a demo to show it in action
[09:46:06] <kborchers> will do
[09:46:18] <jzaefferer> thanks, I'll review any related pull requests asap
[09:48:04] <kborchers> do you guys think the input stuff is ready to be merged into menu or do you want more time to review that visual test?
[09:48:21] <jzaefferer> on Selectmenu: Felix reviewed things and created an issue on his fork for other contributors to look at the suggested changes
[09:48:36] <gnarf> kborchers: which pull?
[09:48:44] <gnarf> we can talk about it in -dev
[09:48:44] <jzaefferer> he tested the typeahead feature in Menu, seems it can replace his implementation
[09:49:30] <kborchers> gnarf: ok
[09:50:23] <gnarf> has anyone from design looked at the pile-o-pulls?
[09:50:46] <gnarf> and whats up with that translation one? :)
[09:57:32] <jzaefferer> probably not
[09:58:02] <jzaefferer> need a pull triage with one or more designers?
[09:58:11] <gnarf> http://oksoclap.com/ui-pull-requests
[09:58:25] <gnarf> jzaefferer: The 4 that need eyes are at the top
[10:00:54] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:01:29] <jzaefferer> seems like three button issues, one about IE8 opacity
[10:02:00] <jzaefferer> got the feeling toddparker or Maggie or someone looked at them already, at least the case for input/button/anchor in IE7
[10:03:24] <toddparker> i know maggie looked at a bunch of the css issues
[10:03:44] <toddparker> it came down to a decision that y'all need to make on how many hacks you want to add
[10:04:23] <toddparker> in mobile, we went the route of normalizing all the markup so things look consistent everywhere instead of trying to hack the native controls
[10:04:31] <toddparker> but that's a conversation for another day :)
[10:05:02] <jzaefferer> I like that approach, can we adapt that?
[10:05:39] <borismoore> Hi - got held up a minute
[10:06:05] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js
[10:06:49] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-types.html
[10:07:45] <toddparker> we essentially just wrap the native element in a div and style that but you're still interacting with the native control
[10:08:13] <jzaefferer> okay, that sounds like something we could apply to button, too
[10:08:25] <jzaefferer> will have to discuss that another time
[10:08:31] <jzaefferer> now GRID meeting
[10:08:56] <jzaefferer> borismoore is here, I don't see Brad or Richard
[10:09:23] <jzaefferer> the agenda isn't quite up-to-date
[10:09:28] <borismoore> Just pinging Brad
[10:09:38] <jzaefferer> I've made some good progress on editing: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40076465/Grid-Editing
[10:09:59] <jzaefferer> the grid demo now has spreadsheet-like cell navigation: http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-editing/grid.html
[10:10:09] <jzaefferer> and there's a seperate example with full row editing: http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-editing/grid-row-editing.html
[10:10:19] <borismoore> Brad is offline, right now.
[10:10:31] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:11:23] <jzaefferer> as for custom inputs, Felix is gathering feedback on our Selectmenu spec; Josh Bush wrote a sepc for Mask; Hans Hillen is working on the datepicker prototype, adding ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
[10:11:54] <jzaefferer> I talked with Hans earlier today, need to get back to Felix and Josh
[10:12:33] <jzaefferer> planning to get together with Boris and Brad later today to review the new observable/editing-events implementation
[10:13:03] <jzaefferer> Richard isn't here, but I don't think there was progress on Selecting since the last meeting
[10:13:12] <borismoore> I did some work on selection, following on from Richard
[10:13:13] <jzaefferer> need to get that rolling again next week
[10:13:18] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[10:13:29] <jzaefferer> yeah, need to get that published :-)
[10:13:32] <borismoore> It's part of this code:
[10:13:38] <borismoore> Code and demos available here: https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-ui/commit/c2e9aaa198e607eadba319aa3ae1c4d5b8064641 http://borismoore.github.com/jquery-ui/grid-spf-observable/index.html
[10:13:51] <borismoore> Just needs review
[10:14:20] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[10:14:23] <borismoore> There is an incompatibility right now between the selection from Richard and the editing control from Joern
[10:14:25] <jzaefferer> yeah, I'll have to dig into that
[10:14:33] <borismoore> Selection takes over the mouse click
[10:14:46] <jzaefferer> I've been wondering about that
[10:14:53] <jzaefferer> having seperate demos probably isn't so useful
[10:15:04] <jzaefferer> as the interaction is pretty important
[10:15:22] <jzaefferer> your demos don't have inline editing, right?
[10:15:27] <borismoore> Yes. I started looking at Joern's editing demo and code and adding observability
[10:15:50] <borismoore> But I had to remove the selection integration for now for that demo
[10:16:06] <borismoore> Not you committed but soon be ready
[10:16:13] <borismoore> yet committed
[10:16:29] <borismoore> That will have inline editing
[10:16:44] <borismoore> but use observability etc
[10:17:07] <borismoore> Should reduce dependency on some of the helpers.js code
[10:17:11] <jzaefferer> okay, well, seems like no one else is here anyway (wrong?), so let's get on Skype later and dig into that
[10:17:36] <borismoore> Sure, sounds good. I also did a lot of work before that on template implementation comparison
[10:17:42] <borismoore> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Template-Comparison
[10:17:49] <borismoore> which also will need review.
[10:17:55] <jzaefferer> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41375604/Template-Comparison
[10:17:59] <jzaefferer> oops
[10:18:00] <jzaefferer> yeah
[10:18:05] <jzaefferer> (too slow)
[10:18:12] <jzaefferer> what's the status there?
[10:18:13] <borismoore> np
[10:18:31] <borismoore> I am setting up a Skype discussion with Mike
[10:19:05] <borismoore> He took a lot of detailed review comments back from me, in addition to what is on the comparison page, and we had some email discussion around that
[10:19:21] <borismoore> I don't think he disagrees with me, mostly at least
[10:19:39] <borismoore> But that will be clearer when we discuss further on Skype
[10:20:12] <borismoore> I have some thoughts as to how his code could be pretty useful, but need to share the thinking with him
[10:20:25] <gnarf> (i'm here too, just lurking as i don't have much to add)
[10:20:56] <borismoore> He looks interested in collaborating, and has been working on getting me to be able to build his project under Windows :)
[10:21:15] <borismoore> that's basically it.
[10:21:16] <jzaefferer> okay, so that sounds like we'll wait for the results there, then try to figure out how to move forward to get a templating implementation into UI
[10:21:17] <borismoore> Hi gnarf
[10:21:21] <borismoore> :)
[10:21:43] <jzaefferer> I want to try out jsrender+jsviews sometime soon
[10:21:59] <jzaefferer> see what they provide to replace jquery-tmpl's tmplItem() method
[10:22:05] <borismoore> yeah, well our chat later today should be a good first step
[10:22:20] <borismoore> You have the tmplItem equivalent (plus a bit more)
[10:22:42] <borismoore> So full scenario coverage of what tmpl provides already
[10:23:00] <jzaefferer> btw. just noticed you have a "yes" in the plugin wrapper cell for "most other…", but its still red, not green
[10:23:16] <borismoore> I have that in my integration work we will be discussing
[10:23:43] <jzaefferer> remember the discussion we once had about the wrap tag? what does Mike think of that?
[10:24:14] <borismoore> for the red yes, I'll correct that
[10:24:30] <borismoore> For wrap, he doesn't have it implemented, but plans to do so
[10:24:44] <jzaefferer> I can see a usecase for template composition via wrapping, but still think the current "API" for that is too complicated, making the feature rather useless
[10:24:58] <borismoore> I have it implemented in jsrender, although I have no DOM dependency there. So he can do the same
[10:25:13] <jzaefferer> oh?
[10:25:13] <borismoore> As for the API, yeah I know your concerns about that.
[10:25:24] <jzaefferer> is the implementation in jsrender different then?
[10:25:39] <jzaefferer> do you have a sample I can look at for jsrender's wrap?
[10:25:46] <borismoore> Same template markup syntax and semantics for wrap
[10:25:58] <jzaefferer> okay :/
[10:26:00] <borismoore> Sure, I'll look for it
[10:26:33] <borismoore> We can still discuss the API versus the scenario, to figure the optimal design
[10:27:15] <borismoore> http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/step-by-step/03_tabs-using-wrap-tag.html
[10:27:35] <borismoore> Renders the wrap stuff in jsrender, then activates using JsViews
[10:28:43] <borismoore> Guess that's it for IRC. We just need to set up the Skype call
[10:29:12] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:29:18] <jzaefferer> yeah, my concerns there are still the same
[10:29:32] <borismoore> Sure we can discuss that
[10:29:53] <jzaefferer> the $view.html(selector) stuff is a really odd programming model, from my perspective anyway
[10:30:24] <gnarf> selector?
[10:30:36] <jzaefferer> like {{each $view.html("h3", true)}}
[10:30:48] <borismoore> Let's discuss it on Skype too, some time
[10:31:05] <borismoore> Easier to get where each person is coming from
[10:31:05] <jzaefferer> that's it then for this meeting, see you next week (or on Skype soon)
[10:31:13] <gnarf> does that work? :)
[10:31:21] <borismoore> yes
[10:31:34] <borismoore> It is within template syntax and feature support
[10:31:46] <borismoore> See the demo link above
[10:32:04] <borismoore> Works in jsrender and also in jquery tmpl
[10:32:18] <borismoore> OK, see you later
