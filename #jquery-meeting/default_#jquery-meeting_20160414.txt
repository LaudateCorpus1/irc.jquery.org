[12:00:35] <bethge_> Hi
[12:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately I haven't gotten a chance to review your PR yet.
[12:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> But, I should have a large chunk of tomorrow to work on PEP and jQuery UI.
[12:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz_ never ended up merging the ChromeDriver PR either.
[12:03:00] <bethge_> I am afraid I did not get to do much last week either :(
[12:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> But I did get Rick Byers to reply about offsetX/Y :-)
[12:03:15] <bethge_> Right!
[12:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, do you want to discuss anything today or should we just wait till next week?
[12:06:03] <bethge_> Waiting till next week sounds good
[12:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, I guess we're done then :-P
[12:07:00] <bethge_> The spring tends to lure me away from the computer :)
[12:07:13] <bethge_> okidoki ;)
[12:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yeah, enjoy the nice weather :-)

[14:10:42] <cgack> I'll start things off... I've nothing to report as I just got back from vacation
[14:10:53] <jasperdegroot> welcome back
[14:10:57] <cgack> thanks
[14:11:09] <jasperdegroot> cgack: was table still waiting on review?
[14:11:36] <cgack> no, it landed after the tests were fixed
[14:11:39] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1094321574
[14:12:18] <jasperdegroot> ah ok, missed that it was actually merged
[14:12:55] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: the CSS part of the selectmenu PR looks good to me
[14:13:07] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Awesome! Thanks for looking over it.
[14:13:11] <jasperdegroot> I just opened a PR to fix that icon issue
[14:13:15] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: I'll pass it to arschmitz_ then.
[14:13:17] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: I will comment on the PR
[14:13:49] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: but we still have that FF issue with the popup, right?
[14:14:01] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, right!
[14:14:04] <gabrielschulhof> Good point.
[14:14:11] <gabrielschulhof> *sigh*
[14:14:25] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll comment that and place the PR back in modification mode.
[14:14:39] <jasperdegroot> ok good
[14:15:47] <gabrielschulhof> Alright, so I guess since we're talking about selectmenu, I'm afraid I haven't had much time for it since last week :/
[14:16:15] <gabrielschulhof> I'll try to look at that FF dialog transition this week.
[14:16:43] <jasperdegroot> great
[14:17:02] <gabrielschulhof> I'm surprised plain dialog transitions aren't bad.
[14:17:47] <gabrielschulhof> Actually, looking at http://view.jquerymobile.com/7731-selectmenu-classes-option/demos/pages-dialog/, plain dialog transitions are pretty bad too.
[14:17:55] <gabrielschulhof> I dunno though if it's not just our demos.
[14:18:26] <jasperdegroot> let's test in a JSBin
[14:18:32] <gabrielschulhof> ... the way the left-hand-size collapsible sticks around may just be because of the left-hand-side collapsible.
[14:18:47] <jasperdegroot> we do some special stuff in the demos to make the menu responsive
[14:18:55] <jasperdegroot> that is, making a hidden panel visible
[14:19:05] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: I think it's to do with scrolling to the top and then back again on the source page.
[14:19:54] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: didn't you look into panel and scrolling
[14:20:24] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: let's keep this issue out of the selectmenu PR
[14:20:52] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Want me to file it separately?
[14:21:04] <jasperdegroot> I suggest that arschmitz_ reviews that one and we make a separate ticket for this
[14:21:09] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: yes that would be great
[14:21:13] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Well, there /is/ a selectmenu-specific issue.
[14:21:22] <gabrielschulhof> The dialog appears, then moves down about 400px.
[14:21:36] <gabrielschulhof> That's different from the dialog-opens-in-the-demos issue.
[14:21:39] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: that could be because of the scrolling too
[14:21:57] <jasperdegroot> let's first see what issues remain if we test outside the demos
[14:22:01] <gabrielschulhof> Could be, but regular dialogs do not move down 400px after they appear.
[14:22:04] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:22:40] <gabrielschulhof> I think it's a bit of both.
[14:24:34] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'm done. Anybody else?
[14:25:11] <jasperdegroot> I am good
[14:25:54] <cogwurx> I got nothin'
[14:26:28] <apsdehal> jasperdegroot: No, not as of now. Will do soon
[14:26:43] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: ok perfect, thanks
[14:26:52] <cgack> I'm good too
[14:27:27] <gabrielschulhof> Alright ... next week, same bat-time, same bat-channel?
[14:28:38] <cogwurx> later
[14:28:46] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:28:51] <gabrielschulhof> L8R all!
