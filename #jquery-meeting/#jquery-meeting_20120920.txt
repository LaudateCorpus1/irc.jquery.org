[11:01:00] <toddmparker_> Hi all
[11:01:05] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:01:14] <toddmparker_> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:01:17] <toddmparker_> roll call!
[11:01:36] <toddmparker_> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1yY54F02Khk6DIfmD4GUC_EcdE1GEuVTxwFhtIG-38/edit?pli=1#heading=h.crg760xoxv4
[11:01:45] * _|Nix|_ jumps and waves about
[11:01:47] <johnbender> estoy aqui
[11:01:53] <toddmparker_> hola
[11:02:30] <_|Nix|_> Heippa, jätkät!
[11:02:39] <uGoMobi> ook goede avond
[11:03:04] <MauriceG> Guten Abend
[11:03:12] <JasonDScott> Bonjour
[11:03:28] <toddmparker_> so international.
[11:03:35] <toddmparker_> now speak 'merican please.
[11:03:42] <MauriceG> Hi
[11:04:16] <toddmparker_> anyone know if gseguin is coming?
[11:04:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no but I do know that he got the amd-builder fired up locally with Vagrant yesterday
[11:04:52] <johnbender> Vagrant is win
[11:06:06] <toddmparker_> BOOM
[11:06:22] <toddmparker_> who was the genius behind that project? we should give him a hand.
[11:06:36] <johnbender> lol
[11:06:43] <johnbender> mitchell hashimoto :P
[11:06:53] <toddmparker_> Alright, I'll kick this off
[11:06:58] <toddmparker_> 1.2 RC2 - Slated for week of 23rd - We’ve fixed a few issues since RC that trigger a new RC cycle.
[11:07:07] <toddmparker_> Current 1.2.0 blocker issues we’re tracking: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=13&state=open
[11:07:17] <toddmparker_> Select zoom fix not working in iOS6 final
[11:07:17] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5041
[11:07:41] <toddmparker_> wilto fixed this just now. Not a pretty fix, but it will work.
[11:07:53] <Wilto> We do what we must.
[11:09:21] <Wilto> Think Kin wanted to take a look at it.
[11:09:30] <Wilto> But I mean, the setTimeout works, if we’re all cool with that I can close it.
[11:09:40] <toddmparker_> ok, so that is still open, but we have a workaround in place
[11:09:52] <Wilto> Yeah. One way or the other, I’m on it.
[11:09:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You just died a little more inside, eh?
[11:09:59] <toddmparker_> the only other blocker for RC2 is...(drumroll)
[11:10:02] <toddmparker_> Popups not displaying on Opera Mini
[11:10:02] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5040
[11:10:15] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: have you looked at this?
[11:10:28] <toddmparker_> Just logged this last night, it's new
[11:10:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I've read the report.
[11:10:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Just now.
[11:10:54] <toddmparker_> :)
[11:10:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, not much so far.
[11:11:03] <uGoMobi> on opera mobile the popup scrolls to the top too
[11:11:09] <toddmparker_> Here's my theory: mini is B grade
[11:11:17] <uGoMobi> difference is that the popup is displayed
[11:11:20] <toddmparker_> because hashchange is wonky there.
[11:11:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: which reminds me
[11:11:40] <toddmparker_> are we properly excluding them from popup like we are for WP7?
[11:12:04] <_|Nix|_> If AJAX is not enabled, then history is not enabled in popup.
[11:12:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L705
[11:12:36] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[11:13:03] <_|Nix|_> Yep, that's where we take the no-history path.
[11:13:03] <uGoMobi> I think it has to do with how opera mini handles links
[11:13:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we should probably consolidate that with the one in _create
[11:13:23] <johnbender> there's no reason to do it in open is there?
[11:13:54] <johnbender> shit makes me nervous
[11:13:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I suppose we can assume it won't change across open()s.
[11:14:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah same logic as the one for _create
[11:14:10] <johnbender> we can make it dynamic later
[11:14:16] <johnbender> we can't do the reverse
[11:14:43] <_|Nix|_> I guess we have to put it in _create() because it's not yet set during $.widget() ...
[11:14:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[11:14:56] <johnbender> mobileinit
[11:16:05] <toddmparker_> so we're going to make this move?
[11:16:10] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:16:13] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[11:16:14] <uGoMobi> I am testing opera mini now and popups do open but are positioned at the top
[11:16:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: i was seeing that for the first, but others weren't opening
[11:16:44] <toddmparker_> maybe they were, just way offscreen at the top
[11:16:48] <uGoMobi> i see it with all popups so far
[11:17:01] <uGoMobi> have to scroll to the top of the page to find the popup
[11:17:07] <uGoMobi> but it's there
[11:17:17] <uGoMobi> i think opera mobile does the same
[11:17:35] <toddmparker_> so this might be another browser that doesn't handle the new offsets in core
[11:17:41] <johnbender> bam
[11:17:44] <johnbender> just about to ask that
[11:17:45] <toddmparker_> worth testing this with 1.7.2
[11:18:53] <toddmparker_> ok, i'll test that in a minute
[11:19:20] <toddmparker_> once this is ironed out, we should be in good shape for RC2
[11:19:22] <toddmparker_> other news
[11:19:24] <toddmparker_> New jQuery Mobile project logo released. Updated site, docs, Twitter so far:
[11:19:25] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/09/19/new-jquery-mobile-logo/
[11:20:06] <uGoMobi> whoeha
[11:20:07] <toddmparker_> response so far have been great
[11:20:12] <uGoMobi> nice work!
[11:20:14] <toddmparker_> lots of place to update the logo now
[11:20:16] <kswedberg> love it
[11:20:25] <toddmparker_> thanks all
[11:20:38] <_|Nix|_> Niceness!
[11:20:47] <toddmparker_> team members: the source files are in dropbox under jQM
[11:21:19] <toddmparker_> Issues: Jasper and Maurice are doing great on triage, closing bugs w/o specific test pages. Were over 370 issues two weeks ago, now at 338 overall
[11:21:26] <toddmparker_> nice job
[11:21:43] <toddmparker_> they have been responding to (and closing) issues within hours
[11:21:52] <johnbender> _amazing_
[11:21:54] <toddmparker_> be nice to keep on top like that
[11:21:55] <johnbender> seriously
[11:22:13] <toddmparker_> I think between all of us, we can do that
[11:22:49] <toddmparker_> also, we've been getting help from a new contributor, robschmuecker
[11:22:57] <toddmparker_> which is helpful, welcome
[11:23:09] <toddmparker_> Related: New contributor guidelines added by Jasper, now linked on every new issue form: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[11:23:27] <toddmparker_> new policy is to kick back any issue without detailed info and a test page
[11:23:38] <toddmparker_> close quickly if no response
[11:24:09] <toddmparker_> that's it for me...johnbender - you still on and want to go next?
[11:24:14] <johnbender> yah
[11:24:16] <johnbender> real quick
[11:24:18] <johnbender> then I have to bounce
[11:24:22] <johnbender> testswarm
[11:24:27] <johnbender> we're in good shape on ie9
[11:24:31] <johnbender> all the test are passing in the browser
[11:24:40] <johnbender> they are failing in the browserstack api vms for some reason
[11:24:48] <johnbender> all the failure tests are ones that make use of window.history.back
[11:24:52] <johnbender> so I've emailed them to see why
[11:24:55] <johnbender> nothing back so far
[11:25:10] <johnbender> we have an issue with the initial hash handling that might require work on our part
[11:25:25] <johnbender> arg now I have to find it
[11:26:00] <johnbender> anyway
[11:26:04] <johnbender> we're breaking the mobile router
[11:26:10] <johnbender> for hashes with ?
[11:26:15] <johnbender> on the initial page load
[11:26:32] <johnbender> I haven't been able to think of a way that the mobile router could handle that
[11:26:57] <johnbender> since it would be best not to special case
[11:27:07] <johnbender> I'll look into it more
[11:27:12] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:27:13] <johnbender> other than that I've got nothing
[11:27:17] <toddmparker_> that is tricky business
[11:27:44] <toddmparker_> there are reasons why people don't like dealing with back buttons and deep links with AJAX
[11:27:53] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[11:28:08] <toddmparker_> who's next?
[11:28:21] <uGoMobi> I will go next
[11:28:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_ you actually already did my update ;-)
[11:28:47] <uGoMobi> fixed 2 related CSS issues for 1.2 (issue with float after we removed overflow hidden for the navbar)
[11:28:47] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5008
[11:28:47] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4958
[11:29:01] <uGoMobi> triage: from 380+ back to 330+ open issues (please do a quick scan of the issues assigned to / opened by you)
[11:29:14] <uGoMobi> created CONTRIBUTING.md
[11:29:26] <uGoMobi> that's for the record
[11:29:44] <uGoMobi> don't have anything to add to that :)
[11:30:14] <toddmparker_> thanks uGoMobi, good stuff
[11:30:22] <toddmparker_> huge job on issues
[11:30:29] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: want to go?
[11:30:39] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:33:12] <_|Nix|_> Great ... opera mini cannot access pages on a local server ... Gee whiz ... I wonder why? :-S
[11:33:12] <bot-t> (26 hours 5 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/6ef910d929edaa4c479eef61a814beb82b685c0f#commitcomment-1876909
[11:33:30] <toddmparker_> heh
[11:33:38] <toddmparker_> just made test pages with 1.7.2 and 1.8.1
[11:33:39] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5040
[11:33:51] <toddmparker_> same result with both
[11:33:59] <toddmparker_> so it's something else
[11:34:29] <toddmparker_> Looks like MauriceG isn't at his desk...
[11:34:33] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: want to go?
[11:34:37] <_|Nix|_> Sure ...
[11:34:57] <_|Nix|_> Not much ... fixed 4994 and 5021 ...
[11:35:07] <_|Nix|_> That's about refreshing the page while a popup is on.
[11:35:10] <toddmparker_> bad ones.
[11:35:39] <toddmparker_> do you have time now to chip away at the opera mini issue?
[11:36:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Sure.
[11:37:10] <toddmparker_> great
[11:37:17] <_|Nix|_> Should also have to have at that really subtle issue of jumping outside history when refreshing a page.
[11:37:33] <toddmparker_> nice to be at the point where we just have an issue or two on our plate (for now)
[11:37:36] <_|Nix|_> Not yet codified as an actual issue, but we have it. It's just not spectacular.
[11:37:44] <toddmparker_> sure
[11:37:52] <_|Nix|_> But Opera Mini is first.
[11:38:05] <toddmparker_> yep, for sure
[11:38:16] <toddmparker_> and that change you discussed with johnbender earlier
[11:38:18] <toddmparker_> is JasonDScott here?
[11:38:26] <JasonDScott> I am
[11:38:26] <toddmparker_> (thanks _|Nix|_ !)
[11:38:31] <toddmparker_> how goes?
[11:38:41] <JasonDScott> It goes well
[11:38:45] <JasonDScott> I Added listview option to set the link icon (for 1.2.1)
[11:39:12] <toddmparker_> that will be a nice feature - you can set the listview icon at the UL/OL level with this feature
[11:39:34] <JasonDScott> and I have still been working on the BB10 theme which should release next week
[11:39:55] <toddmparker_> woo hoo. can't wait for that to go out
[11:40:01] <JasonDScott> Me too
[11:40:40] <toddmparker_> been a long time in the making. beautiful stuff.
[11:40:54] <JasonDScott> Indeed
[11:41:03] * uGoMobi is curious about the BB10 theme
[11:41:41] <toddmparker_> it's very impressive
[11:42:18] <JasonDScott> Thanks, I hope it goes well.
[11:42:22] <toddmparker_> we'll work with JasonDScott to roll any interesting fixes and improvements into the core library
[11:42:49] <toddmparker_> anyone else on the team here that wants to give an update?
[11:42:53] <JasonDScott> If anyone is interested in going to the BBJam next week PM me later and I can see what I can do...
[11:43:01] <toddmparker_> sweet
[11:43:56] <toddmparker_> alright, any questions from the community before we sign off?
[11:44:32] <toddmparker_> oh, and there will be another maintenance release for 1.1 (1.1.2) in the coming weeks. TIming TDB.
[11:44:50] <gnarf> nope - would like to add that #jquery-infrastructure is around now for anyone mucking around with servers/websites
[11:44:52] <gnarf> :)
[11:45:09] <uGoMobi> we should try to fix some of the fixed toolbars issues for 1.1.2
[11:45:14] <toddmparker_> thanks for all your help there gnarf
[11:45:24] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: absolutely
[11:45:38] <toddmparker_> rather wait a bit and get some fixes in there
[11:45:48] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:46:39] <toddmparker_> cool, well let's hop off here and look at some prioritization stuff in -dev
[11:46:49] <toddmparker_> thanks everyone, signing off
[11:48:19] <_|Nix|_> L8R all
