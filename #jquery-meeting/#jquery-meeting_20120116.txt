[09:01:10] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron gnarf wow this place is dead today
[09:01:25] <rwaldron> hi
[09:01:40] <rwaldron> I didn't realize today was a holiday
[09:02:26] <DaveMethvin> holiday, what's that?
[09:02:43] <DaveMethvin> so howya been doing anyway?
[09:04:16] <rwaldron> busy as hell
[09:04:19] <rwaldron> client work
[09:04:28] <DaveMethvin> hey it pays the bills ...
[09:04:34] <rwaldron> i worked on this mobile app from july to september
[09:04:47] <rwaldron> they missed their window to re-up
[09:05:03] <rwaldron> so i was on another project that also required 100% time
[09:05:12] <rwaldron> then when that was done, this client was on deck
[09:05:20] <DaveMethvin> AMBUSH
[09:05:27] <rwaldron> i haven't had my bocoup 20% time since july
[09:05:28] <rwaldron> :\
[09:05:29] <DaveMethvin> ive been busy too with client stuff
[09:05:41] <DaveMethvin> oh did you see jQ.mobi?
[09:05:50] <addyosmani> we were just talking about it in -ot
[09:06:02] <addyosmani> It sounded like something Rick would love :)
[09:06:10] <DaveMethvin> hey addyosmani
[09:06:11] <addyosmani> almost as much as he admires zepto.
[09:06:13] <addyosmani> Heya DaveMethvin
[09:06:29] <rwaldron> http://jq.mobi/ ?
[09:06:36] <addyosmani> How are you this fine day, DaveMethvin?
[09:06:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah but jq.mobi is half the size of that bloated zepto
[09:06:43] <DaveMethvin> lemme find it, they have a repo
[09:06:50] <addyosmani> half the size, none of those pesky unit tests
[09:06:54] <addyosmani> because who needs them!
[09:07:01] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/appMobi/jQ.Mobi
[09:07:33] <DaveMethvin> well if you don't have unit tests, you don't need to worry about people proving it's broken
[09:07:42] <rwaldron> i don't get it...
[09:07:45] <addyosmani> this is very true.
[09:07:47] <rwaldron> it's jQuery?
[09:07:54] <DaveMethvin> it's a tiny little subset
[09:08:05] <DaveMethvin> that works for whoever built it
[09:08:11] <DaveMethvin> if we take their word for it
[09:08:11] <rwaldron> this project has to work on both desktop and device
[09:08:16] <DaveMethvin> since they don't have unit tests
[09:08:36] <rwaldron> so, I'll stick with Actual jQuery™
[09:08:41] <addyosmani> I'm *sure* it works perfectly fine
[09:08:45] <DaveMethvin> http://blog.jqmobi.com/
[09:08:52] <addyosmani> it's also probably "fully jQuery compatible"
[09:09:07] <DaveMethvin> jQ.Mobi does not implement the majority of jQuery API’s.  Instead we  polled a large group of developers and picked which one’s they would  need and performed well on mobile devices.  Often, they’d ask for  something to make their life easier, but we said no because performance  would degrade.  To say “we’re faster” than any of the engines out there  is going out on a limb, but tests we ran on jsperf.
[09:09:07] <rwaldron> addyosmani DaveMethvin, one of my New Years Resolutions this year...
[09:09:17] <rwaldron> is to pioneer a movement
[09:09:34] <rwaldron> "Tests Or It Doesn't Exist"
[09:09:50] <rwaldron> starting in 2012, I refuse to use or promote code that is not tested
[09:09:57] <addyosmani> That deserves it's own mini-website, rwaldron
[09:09:59] <rwaldron> or that does not publish its tests
[09:10:03] <DaveMethvin> also i'd like to pioneer a movement for skepticism about jsperf.com perf tests
[09:10:06] <rwaldron> addyosmani if i had time
[09:10:21] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin talk to jdalton first
[09:10:25] <DaveMethvin> when something is 2x as fast but the "slow" one runs 2 million times a second, it doesnt matter
[09:10:28] <addyosmani> Bet we could pull it off if a few of us chipped in.
[09:10:37] <rwaldron> addyosmani by all means
[09:10:47] <rwaldron> all I care about is the message
[09:10:56] <rwaldron> as long as that's not compromised
[09:11:19] <rwaldron> then you're welcome to join me on this
[09:11:25] <addyosmani> I'll ping Tim about it later. He felt the same about their lack of tests I think
[09:11:48] <DaveMethvin> b-b-but they have jsperfs, that's BETTER than unit tests!
[09:11:55] <addyosmani> But yeah. Definitely agree on the same stance regarding unit tests.
[09:12:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin there is a PR that can be closed
[09:12:13] <rwaldron> on sec, i will find it for you
[09:12:15] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:12:26] <addyosmani> also https://github.com/appMobi/jQ.Mobi/issues/2
[09:12:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2 on jQ.Mobi, reported by wookiehangover (19m, 5s ago): No unit tests
[09:12:34] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/657
[09:12:34] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by nmjesus (2d, 16h ago): Ticket #5087
[09:13:18] <DaveMethvin> never mind jesus
[09:13:51] <rwaldron> ?
[09:13:55] <DaveMethvin> nmjesus
[09:14:00] <rwaldron> oh hahahaha
[09:14:14] <DaveMethvin> brbgod
[09:14:23] <DaveMethvin> okay, anways...
[09:14:42] <DaveMethvin> i have a few things in the agenda but since nobody is here AGAIN
[09:14:46] <DaveMethvin> well almost nobody
[09:15:02] <DaveMethvin> we gotta get a quorum for next week
[09:15:21] <DaveMethvin> i think we're in pretty good shape for 1.7.2, at least most is assigned
[09:15:28] <DaveMethvin> but we just have to get it fixed
[09:15:40] <DaveMethvin> and for 1.8, quite a bit is still unassigned
[09:15:56] <DaveMethvin> but we also don't know our schedule for 1.8
[09:16:26] <DaveMethvin> i think our goal should be to get it under the size of jQ.Mobi, we'll just need to deprecate 93% of the api by my cals
[09:16:29] <DaveMethvin> calcs
[09:17:09] <addyosmani> It's a 5 minute job at most. Right, DaveMethvin? ; )
[09:17:29] <DaveMethvin> oh darn my delete key is stuck, I can't do it
[09:17:34] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:18:23] <addyosmani> :D
[09:18:47] <DaveMethvin> well if  you guys don't have anything we can close the meeting, i have a dentist appt to go to at 12:45 anyway so the meeting wasn't gonna be long
[09:19:10] <rwaldron> sounds good
[09:19:16] <rwaldron> i'm reviewing 1.7.2 list now
[09:19:33] <DaveMethvin> ok, well you guys have a good one, I'll be in -dev for a few more minutes
