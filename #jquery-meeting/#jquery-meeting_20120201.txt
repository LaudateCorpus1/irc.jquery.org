[09:02:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez === IRC BOSS ;)
[09:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I'm now a master at copy/pasting that unmute command :-P
[09:02:33] <kborchers> heh
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's get started.
[09:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Infrastructure update?
[09:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> We've been getting a ton of spam since we moved to the new server.
[09:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> in Trac
[09:07:01] <gnarf> we moved to a new server for trac?
[09:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we did, it's been much more responsive.
[09:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> Seemed coincidental that Trac became more responsive when we got the new servers, so I assumed Trac was moved to a new server.
[09:09:18] <danheberden> sry, here
[09:09:32] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i've been on vaca, sry i hadn't gotten back to you
[09:09:43] <danheberden> trac was never moved - nothing has been moved
[09:09:55] <danheberden> hence why we're still formulating a plan on how the servers will get setup
[09:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> Interesting. Any idea why Trac would be working better?
[09:10:08] <danheberden> also the spending stuff re: help
[09:10:16] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i upgraded mysql which helped a bunch
[09:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[09:10:29] <danheberden> mikesherov is going to look at the mysql tables to improve some reports
[09:10:47] <danheberden> that are timing out/ destroying trac due to how many tickets there are
[09:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> So the increase in spam and the improved performance are unrelated?
[09:11:02] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i would think unrelated, as nothing has changed in that regard
[09:11:20] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i have been tweaking the spam aggressiveness on the core tracker to try and tune it
[09:11:33] <ajpiano> it's kind of a weird continuum where if you make it too aggressive, people can't file tickets with links to testcases
[09:11:46] <danheberden> ajpiano thank you for addressing that
[09:12:25] <ajpiano> but i don't have trac_admin on ui so i can't even look to see where it is
[09:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: one sec
[09:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> You're an admin now.
[09:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...snover's still an admin
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> I should probably change that, huh?
[09:13:47] <danheberden> all hail ajpiano, admin of the jqueryui's bugs
[09:14:18] <ajpiano> heh
[09:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano is now responsible for fixing all bugs
[09:14:29] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i'd leave it
[09:14:30] <ajpiano> arg
[09:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: ok
[09:14:52] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: right now it has the same karma setting as core's
[09:15:07] <ajpiano> which is 10,  i bumped it to 15, then down to 5, then back to 10
[09:15:16] <ajpiano> so unless you want to crank it up to 15 for ui and see if it helps with spam?
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'll start by removing karma for logged in users
[09:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> Creating an account isn't a deterrent for spammers.
[09:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> How can we see the regexes for RegexFilterStrategy and the link count for ExternalLinkFilterStrategy?
[09:19:44] <ajpiano> i haven't a bloody clue
[09:20:13] <gnarf> its probably hiding in the configs on the server?
[09:20:36] <gnarf> mikesherov might be able to help with that too - he seems to know his shit when it comes to trac
[09:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll ping him about it later
[09:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> On to accordion animations...
[09:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> I rewrote the animation logic for accordion: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/587
[09:22:21] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (1d, 3h ago): Accordion: Attempt at improving animation.
[09:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> It's much better than what we have now, but it's still not perfect in all browsers.
[09:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> The animation looks perfect in Firefox (the height never changes during animation), but the content below the accordion jumps around as if the height is changing.
[09:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you think you could look into this with me?
[09:23:20] <gnarf> yeah
[09:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok, got time after this meeting?
[09:23:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: one thing to mention, you know you can pass a "step" func as an option to the animation
[09:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but it runs before the step.
[09:24:15] <gnarf> rather than defining one for _height or whatever
[09:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> I need to define a step function to run after the step.
[09:25:02] <gnarf> thats such a complicated anim
[09:25:09] <gnarf> but yeah, lets peak at it
[09:25:17] <gnarf> peek
[09:25:20] <gnarf> whatev
[09:25:21] <gnarf> :)
[09:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> It looked like the step function also runs for every prop.
[09:25:39] <gnarf> i think you are correct
[09:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> This seemed to be the most sane of everything I tried.
[09:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, kborchers: Any select menu update?
[09:26:37] <scott_gonzalez> Does this need to stay on the agenda?
[09:26:54] <kborchers> nothing from me ... can prob be removed
[09:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like clarkbox is around to talk about TestSwarm
[09:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> So let's move onto the new build process.
[09:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you give us an update?
[09:31:09] <gnarf> so - I'm pretty sure that I got the "Makefile" implementing everything ant did
[09:31:49] <gnarf> also, updated the "whitespace" target to strip BOM as well
[09:32:00] <gnarf> at this point
[09:32:20] <gnarf> i need a little testing of it to make sure its building the proper zips and what not
[09:32:40] <gnarf> and need to look at updating that "distro" script
[09:33:01] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/make/build/release/prepare-release
[09:34:56] <gnarf> i think i handled this part in the new make: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/make/build/release/prepare-release#L244-247
[09:35:07] <gnarf> couple of other things to check on
[09:35:12] <gnarf> but i think it might be usable already
[09:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> We can do a walkthrough of that too and do a comparison of the generated zip to a previous release.
[09:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> That's it for this meeting, unless anyone has anything else to discuss.
