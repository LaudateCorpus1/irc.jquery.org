[09:02:21] <DaveMethvin> timmywill gnarf m_gol rwaldron jaubourg gibson042 orkel etc etc
[09:02:23] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:02:42] <DaveMethvin> i got a running start on an agenda
[09:02:52] <m_gol> present!
[09:02:59] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:03:03] <orkel> hey-hey
[09:03:12] <DaveMethvin> oh boy a jaubourg!
[09:03:27] <jaubourg> ^^
[09:03:30] <gibson042> it's a beaut
[09:03:30] <b-ot> gibson042: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:03:34] <gibson042> `read
[09:03:35] <b-ot> gibson042: From timmywil, 4d 16h ago: The only fails in 1.x now are line-height fails in IE7. Maybe you could take a look since you've spent so much time on it already.
[09:03:48] <DaveMethvin> hey orkel i got my visa today so I am definitely coming to moscow to visit
[09:04:08] <jaubourg> orkel: tried to get the trousers for you at the medieval fair but they don't make those anymore
[09:04:16] <jaubourg> :(
[09:04:24] <orkel> DaveMethvin: great news!
[09:04:29] <DaveMethvin> never thought i'd see that said in a dev meeting, jaubourg
[09:04:36] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:04:51] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure whether timmywil got more drinking or coding done last week in Austin, but we're passing master unit tests
[09:04:53] <m_gol> hahaha
[09:04:54] <jaubourg> note I didn't talk about pants
[09:04:57] <orkel> jaubourg: that's okay, but thank you for rembering this staff :-)
[09:05:15] <jaubourg> you got it man
[09:05:25] <DaveMethvin> things are looking pretty good
[09:05:35] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 can you look at that line-height issue?
[09:05:42] <jaubourg> with the wrong trousers though
[09:06:01] <gibson042> yeah; I've got one more trick inmind
[09:06:06] <jaubourg> (btw, I cannot stay more than half an hour just so you guys know)
[09:06:13] <DaveMethvin> IE7 cannot defeat you!
[09:06:34] <DaveMethvin> okay jaubourg, nice to see you (both here and last week in person)

[09:06:48] <m_gol> timmywil is definitely on fire :)
[09:06:53] <jaubourg> truth
[09:06:57] <DaveMethvin> m_gol git shortlog wll do most of that for you
[09:07:01] <orkel> gibson042: that fact that it's not falling in Safari 5.1 is pretty impressive already
[09:07:04] <m_gol> good to know ;)
[09:07:19] <DaveMethvin> my wife's ipad1 thanks us :)
[09:07:24] <gibson042> it's just ridiculous that the setTimeouts are coming in 1000 ms late
[09:07:41] <orkel> it was driving me crazy :-(
[09:08:02] <DaveMethvin> so jaubourg can you take a look at the open ajax tickets? some may just be closable
[09:08:13] <jaubourg> yeah I was looking at those
[09:08:18] <DaveMethvin> k
[09:08:36] <DaveMethvin> i grabbed a couple I thought would be easy for me to do
[09:08:41] <jaubourg> 14080 is closable, it was never supported nor is it supposed to... $.jsonp solves this
[09:08:45] <m_gol> I'd love to make all modules testing separately to have working tests on their own, are we there already?
[09:09:23] <DaveMethvin> m_gol  you mean if you did a build by itself and ran just those unit tests?
[09:09:25] <m_gol> though that can be done in any moment, after releasing a beta, rc, etc.
[09:09:27] <m_gol> yup
[09:09:57] <DaveMethvin> we could have some occasional job to do that, separate from the full unit tests
[09:10:07] <DaveMethvin> and run it on a schedule, like once a week
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> i did something like that for migrate
[09:10:23] <m_gol> yeah, that'd be grate
[09:10:26] <m_gol> * great
[09:10:29] <DaveMethvin> which is why it yells every monday :)
[09:10:32] <m_gol> hahaha
[09:10:41] <DaveMethvin> i put it on the agenda to fix tho
[09:11:42] <DaveMethvin> m_gol do you want to create that? It's just a jenkins job
[09:11:56] <DaveMethvin> well plus the code to build each module and run the units
[09:12:00] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[09:12:08] <DaveMethvin> anyway it should be doable ...
[09:12:09] <m_gol> I've never really configured Jenkins myself
[09:12:18] <m_gol> and I don't think I have credentials there
[09:12:25] <orkel> separate job for every build?
[09:12:26] <DaveMethvin> i've done it before, let me look at it
[09:12:29] <m_gol> k
[09:12:41] <DaveMethvin> it would be cleanest as one job i think
[09:12:52] <DaveMethvin> one per module would really create a lot of jobs
[09:12:56] <m_gol> yeah
[09:13:02] <DaveMethvin> but i can't remember what is easiest to do in jenkins
[09:13:12] <m_gol> you'd have to modify build scripts, though, probably
[09:13:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:13:22] <m_gol> or just do some renaming after every build
[09:13:29] <jaubourg> regarding #14207, we should probably just leave the status code as is... it means file request will only error with status code 0 but it's probably better than network errors defaulting to 404
[09:13:29] <DaveMethvin> that's what i'm not sure about
[09:13:30] <m_gol> to get jquery-ajax.js etc.
[09:14:11] <DaveMethvin> So what needs to land before thursday's beta?
[09:14:19] <DaveMethvin> i think we will have several betas
[09:14:34] <DaveMethvin> of course the earlier the better as far as letting people try it
[09:15:09] <orkel> i want to land those old optimizations, i can recheck and rebase them tomorrow
[09:15:21] <DaveMethvin> orkel sounds good
[09:15:55] <jaubourg> I'd be glad to tackle 14207
[09:16:05] <jaubourg> provided I understand how to build jquery now :P
[09:16:17] <DaveMethvin> awesome jaubourg
[09:16:18] <m_gol> :)
[09:16:34] <m_gol> as for browser support: any remarks about https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/pull/48?
[09:16:34] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #48 by mzgol (3d 17h ago): Supported browser versions are "(current - 1) or newer" only for rolling-release browsers.
[09:16:35] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg i got it to work on windows so it must be easy
[09:16:53] <jaubourg> you know me and configs, right?
[09:17:18] <jaubourg> but yeah, I should be able to deal with this
[09:17:23] <DaveMethvin> m_gol i thought that was good
[09:17:30] <DaveMethvin> we do need to figure out how to tests old android tho
[09:17:43] <m_gol> yeah, but I didn't add any mobiles there
[09:17:47] <DaveMethvin> and 2.3 is far enough back for me
[09:17:50] <jaubourg> #14036 I gotta check the spec but I suspect a browser bug
[09:17:52] <m_gol> so I think it's ready to merge for now
[09:18:06] <DaveMethvin> m_gol do you have commit on that repo?
[09:18:06] <m_gol> and we'll add some mobile OSs once we figure out how to test all of them
[09:18:12] <m_gol> nope
[09:18:32] <DaveMethvin> ok well the core team should i think so i will see if i can add you guys
[09:18:42] <m_gol> k, thx :)
[09:18:49] <m_gol> so, as for mobile devices
[09:19:01] <m_gol> 1) iOS is dead easy to test, emulators run at near-native speeds
[09:19:05] <m_gol> so that one should be easy
[09:19:19] <m_gol> 2) Android... seems no one knows how to do it in a non-dead-slow way
[09:19:33] <m_gol> there is an Intel package for Atom in Android emulator
[09:19:38] <m_gol> should work faster with it
[09:19:44] <m_gol> but I doubt BrowserStack uses it
[09:19:49] <m_gol> and it crashes on OS X :(
[09:20:11] <DaveMethvin> perhaps we could run that one only once a week in Jenkins? it's not ideal as far as catching regressions quickly but better than nothing
[09:20:18] <m_gol> yeah
[09:20:27] <m_gol> not on every run or Swarmy will get stuck forever ;)
[09:20:40] <m_gol> but at least we'll know where we are with Android failures
[09:21:05] <DaveMethvin> right, it can be a separate job so if it gets stuck it will not mess everything up
[09:21:16] <DaveMethvin> and it can run on the weekend when nobody is around
[09:21:22] <m_gol> ;)
[09:21:24] <m_gol> what do you think about 2.2? Jasper wrote about it in the thread
[09:21:36] <DaveMethvin> 2.3 is far enough back for me
[09:21:38] <m_gol> but I don't really know how much more suckiness we can take ;)
[09:21:52] <m_gol> my position is what I wrote... it's not that 2.2 suddenly fails completely
[09:22:00] <DaveMethvin> i guess we don't know what breaks so maybe nothing does :)
[09:22:01] <m_gol> and if there are some minor bugs, that's not terrible
[09:22:06] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:22:22] <m_gol> we don't even get Android 2.3 breakage bug reports, I doubt anyone would catch anything in 2.2
[09:22:33] <DaveMethvin> we do need some way to mark unit tests as "expected fails" for specific platforms
[09:22:41] <m_gol> right
[09:22:49] <m_gol> now we only have ifs ;)
[09:22:54] <m_gol> as with Safari 5.1 & CSP
[09:23:00] <DaveMethvin> marking them as success makes it harder to know what we don't do right on which platform
[09:23:15] <m_gol> with Safari 5.1 it's not even marking them as success, the test just doesn't run
[09:23:49] <DaveMethvin> well we definitely want to skip it then :)
[09:24:07] <m_gol> we will probably have to do sth like that for Android 2.3 for now but it'd be great if QUnit could handle sth like that
[09:24:20] <DaveMethvin> it sounded like they had a plugin?
[09:24:30] <DaveMethvin> dunno if it does what we need
[09:24:42] <jaubourg> well, what is the syntax we'd like to mark those expected failures? Let's decide on that then code a qunit plugin ;)
[09:25:10] <DaveMethvin> well, good point!
[09:25:28] <DaveMethvin> i think it should be flakeyTest(function...)
[09:25:31] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:25:34] <m_gol> :)
[09:25:37] <m_gol> hmm
[09:25:38] <m_gol> actually
[09:25:48] <m_gol> we want to mark them as expected failures only on specific platforms
[09:26:08] <DaveMethvin> right so we need a boolean to say whether it's flakey (or should be skipped, etc)
[09:26:11] <m_gol> so there should be a boolean parameter
[09:26:13] <m_gol> yup
[09:26:27] <jaubourg> maybe some kind of map external to the tests themselves would work better?
[09:26:43] <jaubourg> we could end up with nasty boolean expressions cluttering the tests
[09:27:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah, probably so
[09:27:13] <m_gol> true
[09:27:31] <DaveMethvin> i think we'll need to see what we are actually detecting
[09:27:34] <jaubourg> we could just liste the titles of the tests we want skipped or whatever?
[09:28:01] <m_gol> how about not skipped but not giving big scary red errors
[09:28:05] <m_gol> but a yellow warning?
[09:28:10] <jaubourg> BIG SCARY RED ERROR
[09:28:19] <DaveMethvin> NOT RED
[09:28:23] <jaubourg> sweet little yellow warning
[09:28:24] <DaveMethvin> maybe a soothing yellow
[09:28:37] <DaveMethvin> perhaps a chartruse
[09:28:40] <m_gol> :)
[09:28:43] <jaubourg> hahahaha
[09:28:48] <DaveMethvin> we'll use a french color
[09:28:57] <jaubourg> definitely gotta be french
[09:29:05] <DaveMethvin> burgundy red then
[09:29:21] <m_gol> so the message is "if you need to look at those failures, you need to drink"?
[09:29:38] <jaubourg> oh yeah, let's make that a DRINKING GAAAAAME!
[09:29:53] <DaveMethvin> the test failures are what drive me to drink
[09:29:58] <m_gol> I think Android 2.x and drinking should always stay together
[09:30:06] <orkel> another problem with Android 2.3 is that we moving to saucelabs, which do not have support for this platform
[09:30:18] <DaveMethvin> they don't? hmmm
[09:30:20] <m_gol> well, at least in one direction, drinking doesn't necessarily trigger Android 2.3 (I hope)
[09:30:24] <m_gol> :/
[09:30:29] <m_gol> orkel: do they support iOS?
[09:30:30] <orkel> only 4.x
[09:30:33] <orkel> yep
[09:30:37] <jaubourg> anyway, what do you guys think of a file per platform that would list the tests that are expected failure?
[09:30:46] <m_gol> seems clean
[09:30:50] <jaubourg> how well would that integrate in testswarm which code I know nothing about
[09:30:53] <jaubourg> ?
[09:30:55] <m_gol> though titles will be meaningful then
[09:31:08] <m_gol> so if you add a space somewhere...
[09:31:10] <jaubourg> that's the only id we have for tests
[09:31:27] <jaubourg> better than a number that will change the minute you add a test :/
[09:31:29] <DaveMethvin> well if you add a space the test will run/fail so you'll know you screwed it up :)
[09:31:51] <jaubourg> we're unit testing unit test titles... how hip is that?
[09:32:03] <DaveMethvin> orkel is right, saucelabs only supports android 4.0
[09:32:15] <jaubourg> I hate it when orkel is right...
[09:32:18] * jaubourg hides
[09:32:22] <orkel> :-)
[09:32:25] <m_gol> haha, and we could create sth like dashboard.angularjs.org (when master fails, the screen pulsates with big green background with white letters saying how many hours since it started failing and who screwed up :D)
[09:32:33] <DaveMethvin> but we could keep some basic tests on testswarm/jenkins i guess
[09:32:52] <DaveMethvin> that's so annoying we can't ignore it
[09:32:53] <DaveMethvin> dammit
[09:32:57] <jaubourg> what a nightmare mobile testing proves to be
[09:32:58] <m_gol> so what's the story with TestSwarm now?
[09:33:11] <DaveMethvin> it seems to be working
[09:33:17] <DaveMethvin> don't know how that happened!
[09:33:31] <m_gol> I mean: are we getting rid of it and letting it rot or not? Bc I've heard that was the plan ;)
[09:33:32] <jaubourg> yeah, got me by surprise too
[09:33:36] <m_gol> timmywil happened :)
[09:33:44] <jaubourg> some people have cardiac problems guys
[09:33:47] <jaubourg> stop fixing stuff
[09:34:12] <DaveMethvin> if testswarm works and saucelabs doesn't support old android we may need to do at least a few tests using ts
[09:34:22] <jaubourg> oh joy
[09:34:25] <DaveMethvin> but we could move most of our regular testing to sauce
[09:34:33] <m_gol> ok
[09:34:46] <m_gol> TestSwarm & Android 2.3, a happy couple
[09:34:53] <jaubourg> or we could pressure sauce to support old Android
[09:35:00] <DaveMethvin> i mean, we got this far without testing android 2.x so there is something to be said for dumb luck
[09:35:12] <m_gol> ;)
[09:35:17] <orkel> jaubourg: just wanted to say that
[09:35:19] <m_gol> yeah, they should, with 50% of the market...
[09:35:32] <jaubourg> orkel: GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!!!1111
[09:35:37] <m_gol> :)
[09:35:43] <DaveMethvin> its' like 35% of the android market now i think
[09:35:52] <DaveMethvin> so getting better
[09:35:55] <DaveMethvin> but still bad
[09:36:17] <jaubourg> oh well, blame vendors who do not upgrade older phones with newer versions
[09:36:20] <DaveMethvin> i have some contacts at sauce, i can ask
[09:36:23] <jaubourg> infuriating
[09:36:40] <jaubourg> man, the name sauce in itself is so weird sounding to me
[09:36:42] <m_gol> blame binding OS versions with browser versions :)
[09:36:51] <m_gol> Google seems to have learned that
[09:37:09] <jaubourg> blame built-in browsers? Those always turned to be so good!
[09:37:36] <DaveMethvin> i keep hearing a rumor that google will circumvent all the carriers by making it so google play store can force-upgrade android 2.x phones
[09:37:36] <m_gol> imagine Windows XP not being able to update past IE6
[09:37:48] <DaveMethvin> that would be great
[09:37:52] <m_gol> that would be weird
[09:38:02] <m_gol> I mean, they can do it with apps for sure
[09:38:12] <DaveMethvin> browsers too, and system components
[09:38:15] <m_gol> but how to make the whole OS update without approval?
[09:38:22] <m_gol> ah, in this way
[09:38:22] <jaubourg> arf, I'm late
[09:38:23] <m_gol> ok
[09:38:26] <jaubourg> gotta fly guys
[09:38:28] <DaveMethvin> cya jaubourg
[09:38:29] <jaubourg> ttyl
[09:38:32] <orkel> bye
[09:38:35] <m_gol> cu!
[09:39:01] <DaveMethvin> i need to run out a little early myself ... two items left
[09:39:04] <m_gol> as for PRs not directly related to the core
[09:39:07] <m_gol> there's this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/366
[09:39:08] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #366 by mzgol (6d 22m ago): Fix #315. Discourage jQuery.support usage, remove examples.
[09:39:21] <m_gol> we should get it merged and published before releasing the beta I think
[09:39:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah that should land soon too
[09:39:49] <DaveMethvin> the core team is responsible for api.jquery.com so everyone should have commit on that as well
[09:39:50] <m_gol> I can do it if I get permissions :)
[09:40:41] <DaveMethvin> i'll do that in a few minutes
[09:41:19] <DaveMethvin> m_gol what would it take to set up mary poppins for us?
[09:41:47] <m_gol> I can look into that but I haven't so far :)
[09:42:05] <DaveMethvin> ok np
[09:42:36] <DaveMethvin> the final item is that releases got a lot more complicated with npm and bower :)
[09:42:52] <DaveMethvin> well maybe not a LOT
[09:43:06] <DaveMethvin> i do not know what it takes to publish for those two
[09:43:14] <DaveMethvin> or who has credentials to do it
[09:43:35] <DaveMethvin> but i do need to update the build script to commit everything when we tag
[09:43:53] <DaveMethvin> including the built files and dependencies
[09:44:11] <DaveMethvin> so i need to look into what that involves
[09:44:42] <DaveMethvin> okay
[09:44:45] <DaveMethvin> anything else?
[09:44:59] <orkel> one other thing
[09:45:04] <orkel> we might also fix #12757, with the grunt task for checking code style issues i bring up in "Style Guide" thread
[09:45:12] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[09:45:35] <m_gol> commit everything? are we doing off-master tags?
[09:45:36] <DaveMethvin> if the tool can do that without being annoying, i am for it! :)
[09:45:44] <DaveMethvin> m_gol yes
[09:46:05] <orkel> well we could try it, if it would be annoying we could revert it
[09:46:09] <m_gol> we're publishing only the full version?
[09:46:19] <DaveMethvin> yes only the full version
[09:46:23] <DaveMethvin> and minified, map, etc
[09:46:28] <m_gol> yup
[09:46:33] <m_gol> with correct names, hahaha
[09:46:45] <DaveMethvin> picky picky :)
[09:47:08] <DaveMethvin> orkel how about if we do the code style check after beta lands?
[09:47:16] <DaveMethvin> i think it's worth a try
[09:47:33] <orkel> sounds good
[09:47:46] <m_gol> I'd like to land my getting rid of oldIE in master tests first
[09:47:52] <m_gol> to avoid conflicts ;)
[09:48:05] <DaveMethvin> m_gol land those before beta?
[09:48:26] <m_gol> that's probably not important, it's tests, not lib code :)
[09:48:45] <DaveMethvin> well you have a couple of days, if it can be done now go ahead
[09:48:53] <m_gol> I just have to get rid of style changes in my commit doing that
[09:49:04] <m_gol> ok, will try on Wednesday probably
[09:49:39] <DaveMethvin> alright, we're looking good then
[09:49:46] <DaveMethvin> anything else?
[09:50:00] <m_gol> added it to agenda
[09:50:09] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[09:50:12] <m_gol> ah, you added as well, haha
[09:50:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah but you added a link
[09:50:23] <DaveMethvin> that's better!
[09:50:33] <DaveMethvin> alright then, see you in -dev
[09:50:38] <m_gol> cu
