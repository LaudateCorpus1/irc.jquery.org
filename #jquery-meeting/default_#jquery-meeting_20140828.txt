[11:02:11] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: gabriel_schulhof: gseguin: agcolom_: cgack: Meeting Time!
[11:02:17] <gseguin> hiya
[11:02:18] <jasperdegroot> hey
[11:02:49] <cgack> howdy
[11:04:39] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[11:04:49] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=42
[11:05:18] <arschmitz> Lets start with 1.4.4
[11:05:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:05:24] <arschmitz> lets release in chicago
[11:05:31] <gseguin> yay!
[11:05:38] * gseguin loves risk taking
[11:05:40] <cgack> yes
[11:05:41] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:05:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: glad your here this will be big meeting id like everyong
[11:06:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Hut diggety!
[11:07:02] <arschmitz> so id like to freeze the code the friday before
[11:07:17] <arschmitz> so we can make sure everything is set durring team meetings to release
[11:07:18] <gabriel_schulhof> That's, like, two weks from now, right?
[11:07:21] <jasperdegroot> that's next Friday already, right?
[11:07:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Or next week?
[11:07:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Wow!
[11:07:32] <arschmitz> and do it that friday at the conf
[11:07:36] <arschmitz> next friday
[11:07:52] <arschmitz> so anything anyone wants in 1.4.4 its time to get the pr in :)
[11:08:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Then we better land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7646 because it's a regression fix
[11:08:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it's against 1.4-stable only.
[11:08:28] <jasperdegroot> we have 15 tickets with 1.4.4 milestone
[11:08:39] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because it's filterable.backcompat
[11:08:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ill review today or tomorrow
[11:08:46] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:09:06] <gabriel_schulhof> The bug just arrived today.
[11:09:07] <arschmitz> Please agressivly ping me if anyone needs a review to get it done in time
[11:09:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah i saw i have already looked at the issue and pr briefly
[11:09:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Careful what you wish for. I once wrote a cron job to bug m
[11:09:34] <gabriel_schulhof> y boss twice a day.
[11:09:46] <gabriel_schulhof> It wasn't pretty.
[11:09:47] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:09:51] <arschmitz> lol
[11:10:51] <arschmitz> anything else relating to 1.4.4?
[11:11:06] <jasperdegroot> 8 PRs with 1.4.4 milestone
[11:11:13] <jasperdegroot> so should be 7 bugs left to fix
[11:11:29] <gabriel_schulhof> Is there a bug-less PR?
[11:11:47] <jasperdegroot> there shouldn't be
[11:11:53] <jasperdegroot> all PRs should have a ticket
[11:12:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot means there are 7 bugs left open after the 8 prs in theory
[11:12:20] <gabriel_schulhof> So, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7155 requires that we add aria-hidden="true"
[11:12:24] <jasperdegroot> rigth
[11:12:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[11:12:26] <jasperdegroot> right*
[11:12:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup thats the plan
[11:13:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... meaning that we need to create a PR incorporating frequent's, and adding the mod.
[11:13:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im planning on fixing that and the same thing in ui spinner at the same time
[11:13:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I can do it.
[11:13:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do you think you could finish the widgets-outside-the-page demo?
[11:13:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ill look at it
[11:13:43] <gabriel_schulhof> You seemed to have a pretty good vision for how to unify the various widget-outside-the-page and external toolbar demos.
[11:13:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but i doubt it
[11:13:53] <gabriel_schulhof> We can punt ...
[11:13:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i need to finish my talk in that time
[11:13:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[11:14:11] <arschmitz> which keeps changing because of stuff going on lol
[11:14:19] <arschmitz> which we will be getting to in a bit
[11:14:27] <gabriel_schulhof> It's not that critical. After all, I haven't seen a lot of bugs that are reported due to lack of clarity in our docs/demos/
[11:15:00] <gabriel_schulhof> So, either people are not using widgets outside of pages much, or they work most of the time.
[11:15:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah i have a feeling a lot of people are just using enhancewithin
[11:15:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: which solves all that
[11:16:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Not super-cool, but what can you do.
[11:16:30] <arschmitz> ok anything else on 1.4.4?
[11:16:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its not terrible just not ideal we have optimized it now so its not terrible like the event system at least
[11:17:31] <arschmitz> ok so pointer / touch events
[11:17:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. I read the minutes. Did not seem very conclusive.
[11:18:27] <arschmitz> we will be in all likely hood continuing with the polymer pointer events polyfill
[11:18:40] <arschmitz> but either under the jquery or dojo banner
[11:19:05] <gabriel_schulhof> So, all that perf talk was just ... FUD?
[11:19:38] <arschmitz> if you read the notes again you will see rick is adamant perf is not the only or real issue
[11:19:55] <arschmitz> and that he has infact found a way to essentially fix any perf problems in chrome and it will still land
[11:20:06] <arschmitz> so it can be leveraged by the polyfill
[11:20:30] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Sounds good to me. Better pointer events polyfill than vmouse.
[11:20:51] <arschmitz> basicly rick said they think we should use a pointer events polyfill
[11:21:03] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: so this basically means that not much will change, besides the people who maintain it?
[11:21:03] <arschmitz> that he things this is an issue to solve on the library level not the browser level
[11:21:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: and they have no plans of landing pointer events in chrome any longer
[11:21:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, as usual, browsers move more slowly than what's above them.
[11:21:45] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: right
[11:21:55] <arschmitz> if you want to see them change their mind they say to star the closed issue
[11:21:59] <arschmitz> and to use a polyfill
[11:22:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Let's start a twitter campaign.
[11:22:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Says me, who doesn't even have a twitter account :)
[11:22:38] <gseguin> or a mouse bucket challenge
[11:22:45] <cgack> gseguin: lol
[11:22:49] <gabriel_schulhof> gseguin: ROTFL :)
[11:22:50] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:22:54] <arschmitz> lol
[11:23:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Eeeew! I actually have mice around the house ...
[11:23:28] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: do you need to freeze your mouse first?
[11:23:56] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean outside the house, but in its immediate vicinity ... that's bad enough/
[11:24:00] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: then that might hurt and PETA is going to sue you
[11:24:13] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:24:33] <gabriel_schulhof> We could just move to Australia, where they overrun entire provinces every once in a while. Then we'll have no shortage of them.
[11:24:38] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyhoo ... I digress ...
[11:24:56] <arschmitz> ok so please everyone if you want to see native pointer events star the issue
[11:25:03] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:25:10] <gabriel_schulhof> I've done my part. Have you?
[11:25:14] <arschmitz> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757
[11:25:43] <gseguin> done
[11:25:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I wonder. If you repeatedly open the tab in private mode, star the issue, then close the tab, does that game the system?
[11:26:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its based on your google account
[11:26:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh ... Well, there goes that idea.
[11:26:40] <arschmitz> ok moving on
[11:26:45] <arschmitz> 1.5
[11:27:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and i talked last week and we want to refocus a bit the 1.5 and 1.12 mobile and ui releases
[11:28:06] <arschmitz> ui 1.12 will include the new button, checkboxradio, and controlgroup widgets
[11:28:23] <arschmitz> as well as the classes option
[11:28:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Ooooh! classes is awesome!
[11:28:36] <arschmitz> and will be released in 2 months
[11:29:05] <arschmitz> we will do a release at the same time adding the classes option to all our existing widgets
[11:29:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Oooh!
[11:29:18] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a tall order.
[11:29:20] <arschmitz> and adding the new button, checkboxradio and controlgroup
[11:29:25] <gabriel_schulhof> panel abuses classes.
[11:29:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes it does
[11:29:36] <gabriel_schulhof> So we'll need a deprecation period.
[11:29:37] <arschmitz> very badly
[11:29:45] <gabriel_schulhof> ... to move to the correct implementation.
[11:29:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we will use a backcompat plugin or something
[11:30:03] <arschmitz> but that will not hold us back
[11:30:31] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess a backcompat might work.
[11:30:55] <arschmitz> since they are nearly ready i would also like to see table and navbar in 1.5
[11:31:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Actually, it might not be so bad, because the keys under options.classes that are abusive can co-exist with the properly named ones.
[11:31:14] <arschmitz> we will also plan on switching the download builder
[11:31:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: actually thats a great point
[11:31:37] <arschmitz> i think i can make that work without a plugin or anything now that you mention it
[11:32:14] <gseguin> arschmitz: will DB support old version of our build system?
[11:32:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: this._classes( "ui-table-correct-key" ) + " " + this.options.classes.incorrectKey
[11:32:19] <gseguin> I doubt it
[11:32:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: rxaviers says it will suport old versions that use the same css comments and amd
[11:33:02] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:33:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Man, this sounds like quite a plateful for two months, TBH.
[11:33:25] <gseguin> what about pragmas ?
[11:33:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: not sure we will have to talk to rxaviers about it
[11:34:04] <gseguin> Ok I'll sync up with him in Chicago
[11:34:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well most of it is just updating classes
[11:34:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we get to bail on negating classes too
[11:35:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec. table also abuses classes.
[11:35:23] <gabriel_schulhof> So, we'll have to implement the same strategy in table.
[11:35:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: figures written by same people at same time
[11:35:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, with only a vague idea of what classes should be.
[11:36:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: actually the pr is 2 years old for classes option
[11:36:46] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:37:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, really, with its current semantics?
[11:37:23] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, then I really dunno much about it.
[11:38:07] <arschmitz> yup
[11:38:16] <arschmitz> anyway
[11:38:35] <arschmitz> this is doable
[11:38:59] <arschmitz> ill handle everything for the button controlgroup and checkboxradio
[11:39:21] <arschmitz> and classes updates are very simple
[11:42:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: currently button, checkboxradio and controlgroup i would say are about 90% in ui
[11:42:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: they are in 4th round of review
[11:43:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: classes is essentially done but has an issue fixed in button
[11:43:40] <arschmitz> im working on rebasing these branches together now
[11:43:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[11:44:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: then we can start a branch based on these to get started on our side for compatability layers we will need
[11:45:34] <arschmitz> i would also say anyone interested in these new widgets now is the time to start looking and giving feedback before they are completely finalized
[11:47:15] <jasperdegroot> yeah, will give those branches a look
[11:47:36] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: im pusshing a new branch once i finish this rebase
[11:47:39] <arschmitz> ill ping you then
[11:47:52] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: there is a specific issue i would like your help with too
[11:48:03] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok
[11:50:36] <arschmitz> icon only buttons are getting wrong height in controlgroups
[11:50:47] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but only in firefox
[11:51:35] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: i can look into that
[11:57:45] <arschmitz> ok looks like we are running out of time
[11:57:55] <arschmitz> is there anything else we need to cover today?
[11:58:17] <jasperdegroot> I don't have anything
[11:58:55] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: let me know when the branch is ready where I can take a look at icon-only buttons in controlgroups on FF
[11:59:20] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesome will do thanks ill ping you in the pr
[11:59:44] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:04:28] <arschmitz> ok anything from the community?
[12:06:42] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back in -dev
[12:06:48] <jasperdegroot> later
