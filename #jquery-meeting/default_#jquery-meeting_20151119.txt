[12:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> bethge
[12:03:44] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta get that updated...
[12:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> So bethge fixed the Firefox bug on linux.
[12:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> And the Firefox bug itself was fixed as well.
[12:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> So the patch won't be needed after Firefox 45 is released.
[12:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to get 0.4.1 out with this fix since it effectively makes PEP unusable for a fraction of users.
[12:06:10] <arschmitz> +1
[12:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> That's actually all I had on the agenda today.
[12:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: How's Hammer work going?
[12:07:53] <bethge> I was wondering about the breaking functional tests.
[12:08:04] <arschmitz> good we have been trying to get a patch release out
[12:08:07] <arschmitz> hopefully tonight
[12:08:49] <arschmitz> the fast click based on touch action is catching on a bit
[12:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/234 or https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/231?
[12:09:00] <arschmitz> which was the POC for us switching to the css
[12:10:04] <bethge> Right: #231 . Does anyone else experience these timeouts?
[12:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had too much time to work on PEP issues, been really busy with life and the upcoming jQuery UI release.
[12:10:30] <arschmitz> sadly im in the same boat
[12:10:40] <arschmitz> i want to finish the touch action stuff asap but have had like no time
[12:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> Let me kick off the functional tests and see if they're timing out for me right now.
[12:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt test` results in a successful run for me.
[12:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> Using ChromeDriver.
[12:17:34] <bethge> Since Browserstack's Chrome has 41 passing tests ( ~31unit + ~10 functional ) I feel like the issue is specific to jzaefferer 's case
[12:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> I can work with him to figure out what's going on.
[12:20:29] <bethge> Yes, would be great to get some feedback from him. I have had some trouble with e2e Testing using selenium at work. Things can vary from os to os and from browser to browser.
[12:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> I had also suggested a while ago that we launch ChromeDriver ourselves. I can work on that too.
[12:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> Just filed an issue for that: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/244
[12:24:54] <bethge> That sounds great. It would make the testing process easier.
[12:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's strange to have to start it yourself.
[12:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[12:28:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i had the in a pr already
[12:28:48] <arschmitz> we didnt do it because colin objected and wanted us to make a real tunnel for intern
[12:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I remember that.
[12:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> So that would still be nice, but this seems easier.
[12:29:26] <arschmitz> i can do it easily
[12:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll assign it to you.
[12:29:40] <arschmitz> i have it already for globalize , the branch of ui, chassis etc
[12:31:55] <arschmitz> sounds good thats small enough i can actually get it done lol
[12:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[12:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in #pep.
[14:02:11] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: cgack: jasperdegroot: apsdehal1: meeting time
[14:03:24] <arschmitz> opps sorry every one
[14:03:28] <jasperdegroot> hi :)
[14:03:28] <arschmitz> oped and forgot to unmute
[14:03:40] <cgack> howdy
[14:04:43] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:04:49] <arschmitz> im reviewing selectmenu right now
[14:04:56] <arschmitz> but i dont see gabrielschulhof
[14:05:09] <jasperdegroot> have link to the PR?
[14:05:12] <arschmitz> cgack: any luck with table?
[14:05:16] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8309/files
[14:05:33] <cgack> just got into it today.  currently mid cherry-pick onto 1.5-dev
[14:05:47] <cgack> going decent, thought just implementing classes on what we have might be quicker
[14:05:51] <arschmitz> cgack: sounds good let me know if you run into anything
[14:06:08] <arschmitz> cgack: im sure it would since thats a full re-write
[14:06:33] <arschmitz> if possible it would be good to use the branch so we get the re-write but how long that will take you matters
[14:06:41] <cgack> yeah, so far nothing major, just the usual merge conflicts so I'm still going toward the rewrite because why not
[14:06:57] <cgack> its just a ton of commits to cherry pick
[14:07:07] <arschmitz> cgack: and i had reviewed that re-write already and it was pretty much good i think
[14:07:18] <arschmitz> cgack: you could squash first if it would be easier
[14:07:23] <cgack> yeah that gabrielschulhof fella does nice work :)
[14:07:27] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:07:35] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: hey
[14:07:44] <jasperdegroot> cgack: can I assign this ticket to you? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8324
[14:07:52] <cgack> oh.. a squash might be a great idea.. thanks arschmitz might try that
[14:08:15] <cgack> jasperdegroot: i'll take a look at it for sure... go ahead
[14:08:18] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Thanks!
[14:08:22] <jasperdegroot> ok thanks
[14:08:36] <cgack> np
[14:09:42] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot:  how goes the demo work?
[14:10:13] <jasperdegroot> I made a lot of progress but along the way I find more and more issues
[14:10:22] <jasperdegroot> so the list doesn't really get shorter
[14:10:25] <jasperdegroot> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8245
[14:10:45] <jasperdegroot> here you can see the preview: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-demos-issues/demos/
[14:10:55] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:10:57] <jasperdegroot> ignore the homepage because I will redesign that
[14:11:00] <arschmitz> feel free to break that up
[14:11:35] <jasperdegroot> also, what are the links to test something agaist 1.5-dev in a JSBin
[14:12:06] <jasperdegroot> we used to have links to the JS and CSS that we could use but I don't remember
[14:12:30] <arschmitz> we kinda cn do that
[14:12:30] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-dev/dist/jquery.mobile.js
[14:12:32] <jasperdegroot> that would make it easier for me to test if something is a framework issue or a demos issue
[14:12:36] <arschmitz> you have to hotlink to view
[14:12:39] <arschmitz> yeah that
[14:12:53] <jasperdegroot> a great, thanks gabrielschulhof
[14:12:56] <arschmitz> there are not cdn builds execpt for master
[14:13:13] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: feel free to do a PR with what you have so far
[14:13:15] <arschmitz> and then work on more
[14:13:17] <jasperdegroot> well it works for testing
[14:13:18] <arschmitz> it looks good
[14:13:41] <jasperdegroot> ok, I can open a PR to merge the commits I have
[14:13:53] <jasperdegroot> but I was squashing a lot
[14:14:03] <jasperdegroot> so we don't end up with 100s of commits
[14:14:04] <arschmitz> sure whatever works
[14:14:21] <arschmitz> i like the new look though freshens things up
[14:14:31] <jasperdegroot> thanks
[14:14:34] <jasperdegroot> that was the idea
[14:14:42] <jasperdegroot> makes it a bit easier to read
[14:14:48] <arschmitz> yup
[14:14:51] <jasperdegroot> less horizontal lines all over the place etc.
[14:14:59] <arschmitz> checklist looks good too in that issue
[14:15:14] <arschmitz> for tracking the things for demos
[14:15:29] <jasperdegroot> some are minor issues, some are more work
[14:15:38] <arschmitz> im sure
[14:15:38] <jasperdegroot> but not everything has to be a blocker for beta
[14:15:55] <arschmitz> right absolutely
[14:16:03] <arschmitz> we want a functional experience but we can tweak
[14:16:27] <jasperdegroot> yup
[14:16:31] <arschmitz> nice with the menu update to use accordion too
[14:16:37] <arschmitz> looks like it works well
[14:16:47] <jasperdegroot> yeah, I hope so
[14:16:50] <jasperdegroot> had to add some JS
[14:17:01] <jasperdegroot> because nested accordions doesn't work out of the box
[14:17:17] <arschmitz> where is it nested?
[14:17:35] <arschmitz> oh the widgets
[14:17:40] <jasperdegroot> form widgets > checkboxradion for example
[14:18:09] <arschmitz> i thought we did this already but we should also move form widgets
[14:18:24] <arschmitz> i always look in the wrong place and im sure im not the nly one
[14:18:26] <jasperdegroot> sure can move them too
[14:18:40] <jasperdegroot> but wasn't sure because you created that form widget section :)
[14:18:47] <arschmitz> figures
[14:18:48] <arschmitz> lol
[14:18:50] <jasperdegroot> lol
[14:18:57] <arschmitz> well i dislike it too lol
[14:19:04] <arschmitz> guess im bi polar
[14:19:19] <jasperdegroot> feel free everyone that items to the checklist if you see issues
[14:19:27] <arschmitz> sounds good
[14:19:32] <jasperdegroot> might be better to do a PR and merge
[14:19:46] <arschmitz> yeah thats a big list and you have a lot already
[14:19:47] <jasperdegroot> we can squash again if we rebase 1.5-dev onto master
[14:19:50] <arschmitz> it will thin it out a bit
[14:19:52] <arschmitz> yup
[14:20:10] <jasperdegroot> ok will do after meeting
[14:21:22] <arschmitz> something i wanted to bring up is http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/11/panels-and-panel-sets.html
[14:21:32] <arschmitz> a few of us were asked to provide feedback on this
[14:21:42] <arschmitz> scott and i both responded
[14:22:03] <arschmitz> neither scott_gonzalez nor i were in favor of it though
[14:22:31] <arschmitz> We both had a few main reasons for this
[14:22:37] <jasperdegroot> can you give a summary of what is in that article?
[14:22:40] <arschmitz> shadowing of the style DOM is not very robust
[14:22:49] <arschmitz> and cross platform at this point
[14:23:18] <arschmitz> It a proposal to make panelset, tabs, accordion, and carousel elements
[14:23:45] <arschmitz> and to make them be able to be represented by the same markup and responsively change into each other
[14:24:04] <jasperdegroot> I see
[14:24:15] <arschmitz> we also both believed that while the markup may be simillar they are actually quite different things
[14:24:23] <jasperdegroot> I agree
[14:24:41] <jasperdegroot> different type of content
[14:24:46] <arschmitz> yup
[14:24:53] <arschmitz> also i think they are very premature
[14:25:16] <arschmitz> there is currently 0 evidence for the viability of adding ui componenets to the native DOM
[14:25:20] <arschmitz> look at dialog
[14:25:26] <arschmitz> only chrome has implmented
[14:25:43] <arschmitz> there is zero interest from other vendors or the community from what i can tell
[14:26:02] <jasperdegroot> but isn't this just another web components thing?
[14:26:06] <arschmitz> and that does not have half the compexity or problems this proposal would
[14:26:26] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: in what way do you mean that exactly
[14:27:08] <jasperdegroot> I mean if we have web components you can make your panelset, tabs, accordion, etc elements
[14:27:39] <arschmitz> sure
[14:27:46] <arschmitz> but these would be native
[14:27:50] <arschmitz> like making a list or a table
[14:28:00] <arschmitz> <panelset preferreddisplay="tabs">
[14:28:00] <arschmitz>   <panel>
[14:28:00] <arschmitz>     <paneltitle>Reposado</paneltitle>
[14:28:03] <arschmitz>     <p>Reposado tequila is…</p>
[14:28:04] <arschmitz>   </panel>
[14:28:06] <arschmitz>  
[14:28:08] <arschmitz>   <panel>
[14:28:10] <arschmitz>     <paneltitle>Blanco</paneltitle>
[14:28:12] <arschmitz>     <p>Blanco tequila is…</p>
[14:28:14] <arschmitz>   </panel>
[14:28:16] <arschmitz> </panelset>
[14:28:18] <jasperdegroot> I understand, just don't see why we need native for this
[14:28:18] <arschmitz> you wouldnt define it it would be built in
[14:28:24] <arschmitz> i agree
[14:28:37] <arschmitz> though the future of webcomponenets from what i hear is not super bright
[14:28:47] <jasperdegroot> yeah, I read that too
[14:28:51] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that's what I heard too.
[14:28:55] <arschmitz> i hear progress on the spec has slowed to be basicly non existant
[14:29:10] <jasperdegroot> http://jonrimmer.github.io/are-we-componentized-yet/
[14:29:18] <gabrielschulhof> I think there are some fundamental flaws, like the inability to selectively override behaviour.
[14:29:31] <gabrielschulhof> ... of native elements.
[14:29:31] <arschmitz> yup
[14:29:42] <arschmitz> that is something i brought up in my feed back on this spec
[14:29:56] <arschmitz> is that i think there are pre requisite things that are needed first
[14:30:51] <arschmitz> right now you cant even consistently style selectmenus cross browser easily let alone something this complex
[14:31:00] <jasperdegroot> exactly
[14:31:23] <arschmitz> my feed back boiled down to prove it to me with dialog first
[14:31:51] <arschmitz> i want to see a successful ui component be available cross browser and have people care about it and libraries use it before we think about things like panels
[14:32:07] <arschmitz> as we know all to well there patterns for panels are not even well defined yet
[14:32:17] <jasperdegroot> maybe 80% is what you need but 20% doesn't match your use case and because customizing will be hard or impossible you end up not using it
[14:32:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: exactly
[14:32:49] <arschmitz> i have yet to talk to a single developer who said they support this spec actually
[14:33:08] <arschmitz> even non library people
[14:33:26] <arschmitz> and i dont know that browsers care at all about this sort of stuff
[14:34:26] <arschmitz> so i think thats all i have for this week
[14:36:10] <cgack> i'm good too
[14:36:14] <arschmitz> ok
[14:36:18] <jasperdegroot> me too
[14:36:23] <arschmitz> i will see everyone back on -dev then
[14:36:27] <jasperdegroot> later all
