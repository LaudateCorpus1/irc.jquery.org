[10:01:25] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[10:01:34] <arschmitz> isaacdurazo: if your around we will probably talk logo too!
[10:02:09] <rxaviers> fwiw, isaacdurazo logo looks really nice
[10:02:26] <arthurvr> I really like it too :)
[10:02:29] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yeah i like it maybe some fine tuning the colors but i like it
[10:03:01] <sfrisk> I like it too!
[10:04:21] <sfrisk> Meeting Schedule: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:06:34] <sfrisk> Okay, I know MichaelArestad  couldn't make it today
[10:06:55] <sfrisk> Which slightly limits about some of the things we can talk about - since we were discussing his PR
[10:07:02] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:07:25] <arschmitz> it sounds like we settled on adding info to readme / contributing based on their intended uses?
[10:07:37] <arschmitz> in regards to his file structure pr
[10:07:59] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:08:03] <sfrisk> and removing the css build files
[10:08:34] <arschmitz> yeah was there anything else to discuss on that pr i think that was it
[10:08:44] <sfrisk> I don't think so
[10:09:04] <sfrisk> once those are done I'm going to pull it in
[10:09:12] <arschmitz> so we can probably comment and once he updates to remove built files that should be good?
[10:09:44] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:09:50] <arschmitz> awesome
[10:09:59] <sfrisk> we can always have the readme bit be part of a seperate PR
[10:10:40] <arschmitz> sure
[10:10:52] <arschmitz> he said he was going to update both shortly in his last comment
[10:11:17] <sfrisk> okay, so that's pretty much all that needed to be said on that topic
[10:11:28] <arschmitz> i think so
[10:11:35] <sfrisk> the other item that really needed to discuss (other then the awesomeness of logo-ness)
[10:11:40] <sfrisk> was the Perf testing
[10:11:56] <arschmitz> Yeah michael was going to look into this and let me know what he though but nothing yet
[10:12:11] <arschmitz> the main discussion thats been going on with this is where it should live
[10:12:48] <arschmitz> do we want it in chassis proper, in a branch, its own repo but belonging to chassis, or in my own personal repo.
[10:13:26] <sfrisk> I've been thinking about it, I was leaning to either a branch or a repo that belongs to chassis
[10:13:57] <arschmitz> rxaviers: jzaefferer: kborchers: all had mentioned they thought it should be in my own
[10:14:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thought it should be in master ( thats what sizzle does )
[10:14:32] <sfrisk> hrmm
[10:14:36] <arschmitz> globalize has something semi similar but its just a table
[10:14:41] <arschmitz> to compare features
[10:14:46] <arschmitz> and thats in rxaviers own repo
[10:15:07] <arschmitz> so there is a pretty wide range of opinion on this lol
[10:15:11] <sfrisk> I guess maybe for as long as perf testing is testing OTHER css frameworks, it's slightly odd to have it in chassis, so I can understand rxaviers, jzaefferer, and kborcher's viewpoint on that
[10:15:26] <arschmitz> sfrisk: well once there are chassis buttons
[10:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just say as as the Chassis team and lead, it's up to you to make the decision.
[10:15:30] <arschmitz> we would add those
[10:15:34] <arschmitz> and test on every commit
[10:15:36] <sfrisk> although, that being said, when we start using it to evaluate the current state of our own framework, I could understand wanting it with chassis
[10:16:00] <sfrisk> since it would allow for people to test changes easily
[10:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry about the opinions of various outside individuals.
[10:16:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah thats why i brought it up here i was just mentioning the opinions others had expressed on the matter
[10:16:16] <sfrisk> More weighing the different opinions
[10:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> By all means, take other people's opinions into account, but it's up to the team to decide how they want to handle this.
[10:16:43] <arschmitz> of course
[10:17:14] <arschmitz> sfrisk: there is also two types of testing we will do with it directly on chassis
[10:17:22] <arschmitz> comparison to ourselves commit to commit
[10:17:29] <arschmitz> and comparison with other frameworks commit to commit
[10:17:36] <sfrisk> then maybe it's best to keep with the css framework for now
[10:17:49] <arschmitz> im really happy with any of the options
[10:17:58] <sfrisk> we can always change our mind later, but for now during development it makes sense to keep it with chassis
[10:18:02] <arschmitz> i just want some idea where to proceed for now
[10:18:09] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[10:19:11] <arschmitz> i can see the merits of all 3 options but from a ci stand point and infra stand point it is easier keeping this internal
[10:20:00] <arschmitz> dont need to pull new chassis into another repo constantly once it exists
[10:20:27] <arschmitz> because idealy we would want to trigger a build on this other hypothetical repo on every commit to chassis repo
[10:20:50] <arschmitz> while this is in theory possible ( we are talking about it on PEP ) it definitely a pain.
[10:21:53] <sfrisk> indeed.
[10:22:10] <arschmitz> related to this i have been talking with the creator of perfjankie and browser-perf
[10:22:13] <arschmitz> which make this work
[10:22:19] <sfrisk> oh?
[10:22:23] <arschmitz> and hes super willing to work with us and accept pr's
[10:23:13] <arschmitz> so thats promising since i found some issues / places it could work a lot better for our use.
[10:23:22] <arschmitz> because right now its not meant for comparison as much as CI
[10:23:36] <sfrisk> Awesome
[10:24:01] <arschmitz> So i guess related to that
[10:24:13] <arschmitz> thereis some things in my PR that will likely changed based on this
[10:24:35] <arschmitz> do we want to wait to land on master until thats settled or just update once things land upstream?
[10:25:20] <sfrisk> how soon do you think it will land on master?
[10:25:33] <arschmitz> my pr or the prs on the upstream stuff?
[10:27:04] <sfrisk> upstream
[10:27:08] <arschmitz> no idea
[10:27:18] <arschmitz> could not even begin to say
[10:27:34] <sfrisk> maybe do what you have for now then, and when they make the updates, we'll update perf testing accordingly
[10:27:42] <arschmitz> so having said that probably not wait?
[10:27:47] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:27:52] <arschmitz> its mostly trivial stuff
[10:28:17] <sfrisk> okay then
[10:28:30] <arschmitz> ok so next question
[10:28:41] <sfrisk> I mean, what you have now works - yes there changes will make life easier, but no point halting our progress waiting for them
[10:28:45] <sfrisk> go ahead
[10:29:03] <arschmitz> do we want a nicer looking url then jq01-test.dev.jquery.com?
[10:29:21] <arschmitz> like perf.css-chassis.com or something
[10:29:24] <arschmitz> for the dashboard
[10:30:08] <sfrisk> I like the perf.css-chassis :-)
[10:30:27] <arschmitz> ok and we can always change that in the future too but its a lot easier to remember lol
[10:30:59] <arschmitz> ok thats al i have
[10:31:49] <sfrisk> yeah, that's about all I have too
[10:31:59] <sfrisk> Unless anyone else has anything to say?
[10:33:55] <arthurvr> I donâ€™t :)
[10:34:31] <sfrisk> Okay then, I think we're good for this meeting
[10:34:35] <sfrisk> see everyone next time
[10:34:36] <arschmitz> bye all!
[10:34:39] <arthurvr> bye!
