[11:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[11:59:27] <fnagel> hi
[11:59:32] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:00:04] <arschmitz> hi
[12:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it's time to make a new agenda!
[12:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18JaqyU8wPJtn0HB9g7DpUiocZo8YC2p7MDovhcFZqzE/edit?usp=sharing
[12:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, got the cross-reference links added to both documents.
[12:07:03] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, ready to start.
[12:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Datepicker update?
[12:08:21] <fnagel> sorry, nothing. Need to answer JÃ¶rns PR comment and waiting for feedback on my Wiki comment. And: investigating that "globalize december issue"
[12:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> Is jzaefferer here?
[12:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's talk about 1.12.0-beta.1
[12:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> The actual release has already happened.
[12:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> Back before Christmas.
[12:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> But then vacation happened. And I never finished getting everything ready (and didn't want to announce during the holidays)
[12:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm halfway through the changelog.
[12:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> The blog post is written.
[12:17:30] <arschmitz> nice
[12:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> We need to get the live API site up too.
[12:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> So not much more to do.
[12:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we can announce today.
[12:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we do anything with download builder for pre-releases.
[12:19:21] <arschmitz> i thought we planned to
[12:19:26] <arschmitz> to hopefully get more testers
[12:19:31] <arschmitz> we even added support for t
[12:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right it's starting to come back to me.
[12:22:54] <scott_gonzalez> We would have 1.12.0-beta.1, 1.11.4 (default), 1.10.4, and 1.9.2, right?
[12:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> And after the stable release, we'd have 1.12.0 (default), 1.11.4, and 1.10.4
[12:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> Does that sound right, arschmitz?
[12:25:27] <arschmitz> yes
[12:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think the list in the agenda is complete.
[12:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> Can anyone think of anything that's missing?
[12:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
