[09:02:21] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042 rwaldron jaubourg orkel gnarf mikesherov -- core meeting!
[09:02:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin:
[09:02:37] * timmywil cheers
[09:02:44] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:03:27] <gibson042> heyoo
[09:03:43] <DaveMethvin> just getting the agenda set up
[09:04:01] <mikesherov> can't make the meeting today :-\
[09:04:38] <DaveMethvin> one more sec
[09:04:41] <gibson042> mikesherov is an obvious liar :)
[09:05:16] <DaveMethvin> alllllrighty then
[09:05:28] <DaveMethvin> so, jquery 2.0 beta 3
[09:05:32] <DaveMethvin> it's going out today
[09:05:43] <DaveMethvin> or i'll die tryin
[09:05:55] <DaveMethvin> i sent around the blog post draft
[09:06:10] <DaveMethvin> still need to go back and tweak the numbers after we land anything today
[09:06:50] <DaveMethvin> so what can/should we land before this ships?
[09:06:58] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to get as much as possible in
[09:07:05] <DaveMethvin> b/c this is likely our last beta
[09:07:12] <DaveMethvin> any changes after this wont get much testing
[09:07:49] <tbranyen> I owe you guys a bug report for named define
[09:08:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah you do tbranyen!
[09:08:56] <DaveMethvin> so on boxModel, should we take it out
[09:08:58] <DaveMethvin> ?
[09:09:04] <DaveMethvin> we're not using it
[09:09:27] <DaveMethvin> seems unlikely others are, certainly not the ones running in quirks mode
[09:09:39] <DaveMethvin> since they never seem to know they're in quirks :)
[09:09:54] <gibson042> I say drop it
[09:10:14] <DaveMethvin> if nobody can think of a reason to keep it, let's drop it then
[09:10:28] <DaveMethvin> and this is the beta, we want to find out if it breaks stuff now
[09:10:46] <gibson042> jQuery UI, doesn't need it, right?
[09:11:02] <DaveMethvin> they don't support quirks either
[09:11:19] <DaveMethvin> timmywil you think that tabIndex hook may not be needed at all for 2.0?
[09:11:28] <timmywil> Yea, I bet we can remove it
[09:11:45] <timmywil> And we're doing it wrong in 1.x
[09:12:02] <rwaldron> here
[09:12:05] <DaveMethvin> sounds like our unit tests need work
[09:12:22] <rwaldron> (sorry I'm late, we just received the canon selphy printer that I ordered last week)
[09:12:40] <DaveMethvin> step away from they toys rwaldron :)
[09:12:41] <timmywil> We basically just transferred over the attrHook to prop, which is fine for most cases, but the unset value is wrong
[09:13:05] <DaveMethvin> timmywil do you have time to look at that after the meeting?
[09:13:19] <timmywil> sure
[09:13:27] <timmywil> not a lot, but that should be small enough
[09:13:28] <DaveMethvin> k i'd like to get it into this beta
[09:13:33] <timmywil> work be crazy
[09:13:50] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron you mentioned 1223 there, the orkel pull that's a kitchen sink
[09:13:56] <DaveMethvin> i agree it shoudl be split up
[09:14:19] <DaveMethvin> not sure if i want to tackle pulling it apart this afternoon myself
[09:14:21] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin 1223?
[09:14:27] <rwaldron> is that my numbering?
[09:14:29] <rwaldron> haha
[09:14:34] <rwaldron> I can pull it apart
[09:14:39] <DaveMethvin> anything inhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1226
[09:14:40] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Pull request #1226 by orkel (1d 8h ago): Fixes #8335 for 2.0, makes additional simplifications for data module and more
[09:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Can you just verify that the :focusable and :tabbable selectors still work in UI with the change?
[09:15:11] <DaveMethvin> whoops https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1226
[09:15:11] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Pull request #1226 by orkel (1d 8h ago): Fixes #8335 for 2.0, makes additional simplifications for data module and more
[09:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> We have tests in tests/unit/core/core.html
[09:15:21] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: sure, but isn't tabbable logic all in UI?
[09:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> It uses tabindex.
[09:15:45] <timmywil> and uses prop to retrieve tabIndex?
[09:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nope. It uses $.attr()
[09:16:30] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L143-L147
[09:17:33] <timmywil> ok, those should work the same then
[09:17:43] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 actually on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1223 it occurs to me that wycats__ was the one who asked for that hook
[09:17:44] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Pull request #1223 by gibson042 (1d 13h ago): Ref #12652: Allow overriding native .click() suppression
[09:17:57] <DaveMethvin> dunno if he had code expecting `this` to be `document`
[09:18:18] <DaveMethvin> it's probably not heavily used in a lot of code but if it's in Ember for example then it's a shitstorm
[09:18:31] <gibson042> DaveMethvin I've since backed off on the claim a little bit
[09:18:45] <gibson042> but I'd like to have it be the root of the tree instead of always `document`
[09:19:08] <gibson042> so, jQuery("<a/>").trigger("click") will see the A element as `this`
[09:19:11] <DaveMethvin> it's hard to know what might break
[09:19:44] <gibson042> that's what betas are for :D
[09:19:48] <timmywil> that can't be that convenient
[09:19:54] <timmywil> just s/this/document
[09:20:11] <DaveMethvin> i really doubt a lot of ppl are using the _default hook anyway
[09:20:20] <DaveMethvin> like i said it was an inside baseball thing
[09:20:40] <DaveMethvin> so either no code will break or it's inside some framework and a ton of stuff will
[09:21:03] <timmywil> I'm sure Ember won't be using 2.0 for a little while
[09:21:19] <DaveMethvin> but sure let's land this, we can always back it out if people will just test and let us know it broke
[09:21:25] <timmywil> oh sorry, I'm still in 2.0 mode
[09:21:52] <timmywil> +1
[09:22:17] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 was there an equivalent change for 2.0?
[09:22:26] <gibson042> it should just cherry-pick
[09:22:39] <DaveMethvin> well if you want it in the beta, now's the time
[09:22:41] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:22:51] <gibson042> let me make some final cleanup and then land
[09:22:54] <gibson042> :D
[09:23:14] <DaveMethvin> and timmywil you've got the focus one too?
[09:23:25] <timmywil> on focus, I'll finish it up during lunch. gibson042 helped us figure out a failing test.
[09:23:31] <DaveMethvin> i think that will do it for beta 3
[09:24:14] <DaveMethvin> okay then i think we're better off writing code now ... anyone else have something for the meeting?
[09:24:29] <DaveMethvin> if not let's get going!
[09:25:10] <DaveMethvin> see you in -dev
[09:25:20] <DaveMethvin> mode #jquery-meeting +m
