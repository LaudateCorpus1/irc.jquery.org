[12:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz  awayrxaviers fnagel  jzaefferer
[12:02:16] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with controlgroup.
[12:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> We've got https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1713 which fixes https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14984
[12:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz said he'd merge it two weeks ago ;-)
[12:03:24] <arschmitz> oh i thought i merged it already
[12:03:27] <arschmitz> lol
[12:03:45] <arschmitz> oops
[12:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> If you merge now at least the meeting notes will say it got merged :-)
[12:05:10] <arschmitz> ill do that after the meeting
[12:05:12] <arschmitz> ok
[12:05:35] <fnagel> lol
[12:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> Based on there not being any new commits to master, I'm guessing you didn't get a chance to work on pulling in jQuery 3.0.0 for testing?
[12:06:18] <arschmitz> i did
[12:06:21] <arschmitz> and it fails
[12:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[12:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> You should just commit and push.
[12:06:45] <arschmitz> effects fail on class animations
[12:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> Just don't make it the default.
[12:06:57] <arschmitz> tabs fails on fragments
[12:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> That'll make it easier for others to test and fix.
[12:07:19] <arschmitz> and tooltip is failing in chrome regardless of version
[12:07:46] <arschmitz> i was just fixing them since there are only 2 failures related to 3.0
[12:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> oh, ok
[12:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> damn subpixels
[12:13:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the only thing I care about right now are getting 1-11-stable and master passing tests so we can do the releases.
[12:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> So that's basically all I have for today's agenda.
[12:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:14:16] <arschmitz> nothing from me
[12:16:14] <fnagel> nope
[12:17:07] <fnagel> I'll visit a music festival tommorow - monday, therefor not available
[12:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, thanks everyone.
