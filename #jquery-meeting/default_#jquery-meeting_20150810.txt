[09:00:28] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, gibson042, m_gol, markelog, arthurvr, meeting yo
[09:00:37] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:00:43] <DaveMethvin> present ... i think m_gol is on vacation
[09:01:29] <timmywil> oh right
[09:01:53] <markelog> i guess Krinkle too?
[09:02:07] <markelog> couldn't reach him for the gitter stuff
[09:02:32] <markelog> although i checked, we can retrieve logs from it
[09:03:11] <timmywil> speaking of gitter, there was a point brought up in the dev leads meeting that using gitter adds a hurdle to cross-project collaboration
[09:03:21] <timmywil> unless every project uses it
[09:03:37] <markelog> what hurdle?
[09:03:55] <timmywil> that we'd no longer be on the same communication platform
[09:04:17] <markelog> cmd+tab and you there you go
[09:04:45] <markelog> i don't think it is realistic to ask every project to switch
[09:04:52] <timmywil> it's not
[09:05:10] <markelog> and if so, and makes a very bureaucratic and not flexible
[09:05:29] <markelog> which seems as a bad thing
[09:05:30] <DaveMethvin> what does using gitter buy us?
[09:05:33] <timmywil> having one place to go if you want to talk to someone for any jQuery project is more convenient than knowing to go to gitter
[09:05:39] <timmywil> just for core
[09:05:49] <markelog> DaveMethvin: sec
[09:06:08] <markelog> as a temp measure we can keep an irc
[09:06:11] <markelog> and gitter
[09:06:11] <timmywil> that's another point. is there anything gitter has that we don't already have or can add to irc
[09:06:28] <DaveMethvin> irc is kind of old school but we log it, post test status to it, etc
[09:06:28] <timmywil> can't
[09:06:29] <markelog> that is why we need a dry run with it
[09:06:40] <DaveMethvin> but is there a reason to use it at all?
[09:06:44] <markelog> it is kind hard to mention all possible features
[09:06:44] <DaveMethvin> b/c we'll still need irc
[09:06:48] <DaveMethvin> so now we just have two things
[09:07:01] <timmywil> that's kinda my first point ^
[09:07:19] <markelog> irc would be a temp measure, that was my first argument  )
[09:07:22] <DaveMethvin> let's add Slack in there too, it's popular! :)
[09:07:35] <markelog> i think it is a good idea )
[09:07:50] <markelog> the bad thing with irc is that it is indeed an old school
[09:08:00] <markelog> which means not a lot of people can use it
[09:08:01] <timmywil> that's also a good thing
[09:08:13] <markelog> most popular projects switching to slack or gitter
[09:08:14] <DaveMethvin> if there's something awesome gitter (or Slack) does then let's hear about it and decide based on that
[09:08:15] <timmywil> I'd say the opposite. Everyone can use it
[09:08:19] <markelog> which means there is more ppl that use it
[09:08:24] <markelog> and less people that use irc
[09:08:37] <markelog> this is especially relevant for the front-end peoplee
[09:08:53] <DaveMethvin> tbh i hear more about slack than gitter
[09:09:11] <markelog> gitter/slack are pretty easy, whereas irc is not
[09:09:19] <markelog> we could try both
[09:09:31] <markelog> if we wouldn't be impress we wouldn't switch
[09:10:09] <gibson042> I'm meh on Slack; it's less accessible than both Gitter and IRC
[09:10:26] <DaveMethvin> mainly i don't want to have yet another window open :)
[09:10:29] <markelog> for example, when we try open irc channel for jscs
[09:10:35] <markelog> there was only couple people
[09:10:38] <markelog> for like two months
[09:10:48] <markelog> but with gitter we have like 40 people
[09:10:52] <markelog> for less then a month
[09:10:59] <DaveMethvin> so if we switch over completely i'm good with it but we'd still want logging, test notifications, commit notifications, etc
[09:11:22] <markelog> i think it is a bad thing that we distance ourselves from the community that way
[09:11:38] <markelog> you got everything
[09:11:45] <markelog> right from the box
[09:11:49] <markelog> plus a nice interface )
[09:12:12] <timmywil> Do we have numbers on that? Seems like irc still has a lot more users.
[09:12:33] <markelog> numbers on who many people use gitter or irc?
[09:12:39] <markelog> or only front-end people?
[09:12:51] <markelog> most projects in our field use gitter or slack
[09:13:08] <DaveMethvin> so if we're going to shut down the irc in 6 months and move to gitter i would do that if gitter is sooooo much better, but i don't want to be stuck watching two places for the next several years
[09:13:13] <markelog> if we include linux or postgress numbers would be different
[09:13:14] <timmywil> we could probably find number of users on popular front-end channels
[09:13:29] <markelog> DaveMethvin: agreed
[09:13:39] <markelog> this is suppose to be a temp measure
[09:13:48] <DaveMethvin> who is it who will talk to us on gitter that won't on irc and/or the issue tracker?
[09:13:54] <markelog> timmywil: yeah, we could try that )
[09:14:15] <markelog> everyone!!!111!!
[09:14:17] <markelog> )
[09:14:20] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:14:32] <DaveMethvin> i don't want to talk to everyone! :)
[09:14:41] <markelog> ref to the Luc Besson movie fyi :-)
[09:14:58] <markelog> with this tool we could be closer to the community
[09:15:22] <markelog> i think we should try, then, if we like it,
[09:15:27] <markelog> we could come up with numbers
[09:15:33] <markelog> then decide
[09:15:46] <DaveMethvin> sure, if someone wants to set it up i'll try it
[09:15:53] <timmywil> Another thing is if the front-end community is split between Slack, gitter, irc, and whatever else, staying in irc makes sense.
[09:16:08] <markelog> this shouldn't be easy design
[09:16:27] <markelog> don't see the connection
[09:16:40] <timmywil> anyway, I'm still willing to do a trial meeting, but we need to work out the logs first.
[09:16:49] <markelog> seems like a https://www.google.ru/search?q=broken+windos&oq=broken+windos&aqs=chrome..69i57.2359j0j9&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#newwindow=1&q=broken+windows
[09:17:15] <markelog> yeah, thats right )
[09:17:48] <markelog> i need to talk to Krinkle or gnarf about it
[09:18:01] <markelog> i reach out to Krinkle, but it seems he is on vacation too?
[09:18:01] <timmywil> I marked this issue needs review because I don't understand it. :) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2531
[09:18:14] <markelog> i remember there he send a letter about it
[09:18:20] <DaveMethvin> damn, i hope you understood it
[09:18:24] <DaveMethvin> i don't
[09:18:26] <timmywil> Are they confused about the purpose of jquery-compat?
[09:18:36] <timmywil> seems like they don't know that jquery will be 2.x and jquery-compat will be 1.x
[09:18:57] <DaveMethvin> now that we all know we don't get it, we can ask them to clarify :)
[09:19:15] <timmywil> or are they talking about using different module formats so they can mix and match?
[09:19:25] <markelog> oh, they want to browserify it
[09:19:33] <markelog> so install compat through npm?
[09:19:40] <timmywil> they can
[09:20:11] <markelog> hm
[09:20:25] <timmywil> I'll ask for clarification
[09:20:33] <DaveMethvin> do they want *us* to browserify it?
[09:21:21] <timmywil> i don't know :P
[09:21:39] <timmywil> the example use case they gave was about including both lodash and lodash-compat
[09:21:45] <timmywil> but that's what we're moving to
[09:21:48] <gibson042> based on the comparison to lodash/lodash-compat; I think this is already in our plans
[09:22:03] <markelog> what is?
[09:22:14] <timmywil> two separate npm packages
[09:22:21] <timmywil> jquery and jquery-compat
[09:22:27] <DaveMethvin> i think jdd got the name lodash-compat from us anyway!
[09:22:31] <markelog> didn't you say we already have that?
[09:22:41] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: heh
[09:22:47] <timmywil> markelog: yea, that's what I'm saying
[09:22:53] <gibson042> oh, hang on
[09:22:57] <markelog> confusing!
[09:23:00] <markelog> )
[09:23:21] <gibson042> it's a request to add _pre-3.0_ releases to jquery-compat
[09:23:27] <markelog> i remember there was a lot of fuzz about the name )
[09:23:31] <timmywil> ohhhh
[09:23:32] <markelog> and now it catches on )
[09:23:41] <gibson042> retroactively making jquery-compat equal jquery-1.x
[09:23:46] <timmywil> well, to clarify, we got that name from lodash
[09:24:03] <timmywil> I suppose we can do that
[09:24:19] <markelog> oh, that was a joke )
[09:24:20] <timmywil> actually, we'll have to
[09:24:29] <timmywil> markelog: ok, just making sure :)
[09:24:44] <markelog> everything is confusing now days, i guess i'm getting older )
[09:24:54] <gnarf> timmywil: I'd support using gitter over slack - but still prefer IRC
[09:25:26] <markelog> gnarf, do you maintain irc.jquery.com?
[09:25:39] <timmywil> ok, thanks gnarf
[09:25:54] <gnarf> markelog: its on github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.com ?
[09:25:58] <timmywil> we'll vote again after one or two trial meetings
[09:26:01] <DaveMethvin> the jquery-compat repo is just going to be releases, right? So it doesn't matter if we dump a bunch of old releases there as far as repo bloat
[09:26:05] <markelog> 404 )
[09:26:07] <gnarf> sry https://github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.org
[09:26:35] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: right, I don't have a problem copying the old 1.x tags over
[09:26:37] <markelog> not sure
[09:27:03] <timmywil> we'll have to copy all the tags to jquery-dist anyway, for bower's sake
[09:27:09] <gnarf> timmywil: my biggest concern is making sure "any random user" can attend the meeting without having to jump through hoops to get invited
[09:27:21] <timmywil> gnarf: agreed
[09:27:24] <gnarf> having a github account is a requirement I can live with (but only kinda)
[09:27:50] <markelog> we can make a closed room
[09:28:01] <markelog> only the ones that are in github org are allowed
[09:28:08] <gnarf> please never do this
[09:28:26] <markelog> what?
[09:28:31] <gibson042> right; _more_ open, not less
[09:28:56] <gnarf> approach 100% openness where possible, anything that needs to stay private should use the dev team email
[09:28:57] <timmywil> yea, we'd only switch if it makes joining easier for the majority
[09:29:40] <markelog> for the record: i'm not saying we *should* i'm saying we *can*
[09:30:01] <gnarf> For the record - I'm specifically shaying we "should not" :)
[09:30:06] <DaveMethvin> i have to run
[09:30:07] <gnarf> perhaps even "MUST NOT"
[09:30:15] <gnarf> whatever the spec sayz ;)
[09:30:18] <markelog> okay, gotcha
[09:30:33] <timmywil> yea, we can stop here. The PRs I've listed are all from Oleg, who's on vacation.
[09:30:47] <markelog> yeah, vacation so hard right now )
[09:30:53] <markelog> i guess you meant m_gol?
[09:31:03] <timmywil> I'm sorry, yes
[09:31:11] <timmywil> Michal
[09:31:18] <markelog> so, the question i asked on previous meeting
[09:31:19] <timmywil> with special characters I can't remember
[09:31:29] <timmywil> how to type
[09:31:36] <markelog> i would like to use new qunit constructions everywhere
[09:31:40] <markelog> and update jscs to 2.1
[09:31:54] <markelog> yeah, that is why i use his handle )
[09:32:01] <timmywil> oh yea, that's fine with me
[09:32:15] <markelog> although, it seems "Michal" is a correct translation
[09:32:20] <markelog> cool
[09:32:24] <markelog> will do a pr
[09:32:28] <timmywil> and with that update, would we also do the auto-formatting?
[09:32:33] <timmywil> of test code
[09:32:35] <markelog> yep!
[09:32:42] <timmywil> great, we can get that out of the way
[09:32:42] <markelog> but there was still be some issues
[09:32:50] <markelog> like long line
[09:32:55] <timmywil> I'm sure
[09:32:56] <markelog> can't autofix that right now
[09:33:09] <markelog> although, i think i could do couple modules by hand
[09:33:14] <timmywil> ok, well, feel free to open a PR
[09:33:19] <markelog> ok-ok
[09:33:29] <timmywil> thanks everybody!
[09:33:35] <markelog> see ya
