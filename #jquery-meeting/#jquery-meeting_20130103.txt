[08:03:57] <jzaefferer> Testing meeting! Ping DaveMethvin Krinkle|detached johnkpaul rwaldron scott_gonzalez mikesherov - agenda: http://bit.ly/qunitci
[08:05:21] <jzaefferer> Let's see if anyone is around or has time, otherwise I'm just going to cancel and we can try this again in two weeks.
[08:05:46] <JamesMGreene> I'm here for once :)
[08:05:51] <jzaefferer> If you haven't, fill out the QUnit survey: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBzQl9TWmQzbDdXS08wMTBuLTlObXc6MQ#gid=0
[08:05:55] <jzaefferer> oh hey JamesMGreene
[08:06:24] <JamesMGreene> (Wife is out running errands, so I'm free for a bit despite being our anniversary :-P)
[08:06:33] <jzaefferer> heh, nice
[08:06:53] <jzaefferer> So I've landed/closed all open PRs except your htmlEqual one
[08:07:02] <JamesMGreene> Understandable, it's a beast
[08:07:09] <jzaefferer> Yeah, that got quite big
[08:07:17] <JamesMGreene> Plus some tests are still failing ie IE7/IE8
[08:07:19] <JamesMGreene> in*
[08:07:36] <JamesMGreene> So I'll look into that in the next few days
[08:07:48] <jzaefferer> there are a lot of calls to other assertions
[08:08:11] <jzaefferer> that's quite different from the domEqual in jQuery UI, but probably much more useful
[08:08:14] <JamesMGreene> You mean in the tests, right?
[08:08:24] <jzaefferer> ah, yeah
[08:08:28] <jzaefferer> nvm
[08:08:34] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, I couldn't really find a way to bridge the two that well other than the serialization bit, and even that is fairly different
[08:09:24] <JamesMGreene> RE: the tests having lots of assertions (test-specific assert methods that call other assertions), is that something I should be managing myself to avoid the over-inflated assertion counts?
[08:10:49] <JamesMGreene> It's doable and would certainly reduce the noise in the HTML report
[08:12:40] <jzaefferer> doesn't matter that much, since its a separate suite anyway
[08:13:27] <JamesMGreene> *shrugs*
[08:13:28] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:13:32] <jzaefferer> well, I'll do a code review in the PR
[08:13:33] * JamesMGreene shrugs
[08:13:34] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:13:40] <jzaefferer> might take some time though :/
[08:13:54] <JamesMGreene> I saw your first comment about feature-checking for jQuery stuff, I'll remove those
[08:14:58] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: since you're using add-ons and now writing more - the major feedback from the survey so far is that most people don't even know add-ons exist. Any suggestions on how to better promote them?
[08:15:31] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[08:15:39] <JamesMGreene> I was unaware of them for quite some time as well, I think
[08:16:09] <jzaefferer> ps: you've got access to the survey results now
[08:16:14] <JamesMGreene> thanks
[08:17:46] <JamesMGreene> Have you guys ever discussed having pending tests?
[08:18:22] <JamesMGreene> (e.g. like Mocha, if you're not familiar)
[08:18:28] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: yes, that comes up every once in a while. Not yet mentioned in the survey though. I don't like it and so far no one insisted enough...
[08:18:43] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: is this something you could work on implementing? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/385
[08:18:44] <JamesMGreene> I mentioned it in the survey
[08:18:57] <jzaefferer> ah, okay, didn't yet check the newest answers
[08:19:09] <JamesMGreene> 'sok
[08:19:19] <jzaefferer> or missed it /o\
[08:19:20] <JamesMGreene> I could work on it but probably not for at least a week or two
[08:19:40] <JamesMGreene> Mine's tough... I missed it a few times when scrolling because it takes up a whole page :-P
[08:19:49] <JamesMGreene> (scrolls right by)
[08:20:00] <JamesMGreene> I'm behind on some tasks for PhantomJS and ZeroClipboard
[08:20:06] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:20:41] <jzaefferer> well, as for pending tests: I don't really like having the testsuite abused as a todo list. Either you wrote a test, or you don't, but adding placeholders is just adding entropy (or whatever the right term would be)
[08:21:01] <jzaefferer> If you implementing something that you know you have to test, you should add a test, not a placeholder, right?
[08:21:14] <jzaefferer> That said, in which cases do you see these pendings as useful?
[08:22:11] <JamesMGreene> Right, it's just a TODO but with a visual representation so it's not so easily overlooked (i.e. anyone who runs the tests will see them rather than only seeing the TODOs if they dig into the code)
[08:22:34] <JamesMGreene> I'm not adamant about it or anything but I thought it was a useful idea when I was first trying out Mocha
[08:23:13] <JamesMGreene> I usually have more trouble coming up with the test ideas than writing the tests ;)
[08:23:33] <jzaefferer> Well, in that case I'd table that idea once more :-)
[08:25:15] <JamesMGreene> Like I said, I think having the visual representation is useful rather than having a comment-based TODO. On the flip side, too many pending tests clutter the report, too.
[08:25:30] <JamesMGreene> I'd say make it an addon but it probably isn't a very natural extension point :-P
[08:26:24] <JamesMGreene> It would have to duck-punch the `test` method as well as whatever method(s) are responsible for counts and reporting
[08:26:54] <JamesMGreene> Might be doable, I'd have to dig into the code more. Still just getting familiar
[08:27:51] <jzaefferer> There's certainly more valuable stuff to tackle
[08:27:57] <JamesMGreene> yeah
[08:27:58] <jzaefferer> Like the codebase split or better async testing
[08:28:14] <JamesMGreene> More info on the latteR?
[08:28:51] <jzaefferer> A few ideas here: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/331
[08:28:55] <JamesMGreene> I need to give "composite" a makeover, too
[08:30:21] <JamesMGreene> k, makes sense
[08:32:30] <JamesMGreene> With regard to the first comments in that, a number of the other frameworks (I believe) allow you to _optionally_ pass an argument called `done` that, if present in the argument list, but be called to finalize the test
[08:32:38] <JamesMGreene> I like that pattern, keeps it simple
[08:32:47] <JamesMGreene> Mocha has that, I believe BusterJS does too
[08:34:11] <JamesMGreene> Basically that's their entire asyncTest impl
[08:34:13] <JamesMGreene> http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/#asynchronous-code
[08:34:55] <JamesMGreene> if a function called `done` is present (provided by the framework, if the user adds it to the arg list), then the test is automatically considered to be async
[08:35:25] <jzaefferer> okay, interesting
[08:36:15] <jzaefferer> well, the argument to the test() callback is already taken
[08:36:44] <jzaefferer> one suggestion was `test(…, function(assert) { var done = assert.async(); … done(); }`
[08:38:04] <JamesMGreene> I am guessing you wouldn't go for `this.done()` since others may have already used that :)
[08:38:32] <jzaefferer> kinda
[08:38:43] <JamesMGreene> That suggestion's not too bad, though
[08:39:00] <jzaefferer> but then you'd still hae to make it async explicitly and keep that `this` context inside callback
[08:39:09] <jzaefferer> *have
[08:39:10] <JamesMGreene> yeah
[08:39:30] <JamesMGreene> Could that be more automatic if we continue to provide `asyncTest`?  Hmm
[08:39:46] <jzaefferer> the main motivation for assert.async()() is to have it fail it bound to that particular test
[08:40:00] <JamesMGreene> right
[08:40:04] <jzaefferer> so that we can avoid non-deterministic failures when assertions leak from one test into another
[08:40:58] <jzaefferer> asyncTest(..., function(assert) { assert.done(); })
[08:41:01] <jzaefferer> or
[08:41:01] <jzaefferer> asyncTest(..., function(assert, done) {done(); })
[08:41:10] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[08:42:03] <JamesMGreene> Opposed to magical `done` propagation via closure in the function invocation?
[08:43:00] <jzaefferer> yeah
[08:43:17] <jzaefferer> I would consider that without the existing assert argument
[08:43:28] <jzaefferer> too late for that
[08:43:44] <JamesMGreene> I suppose
[08:43:46] <jzaefferer> also not a big fan of magic
[08:44:09] <JamesMGreene> Well, especially if their existing test bodies already have a variable named `done` :)
[08:44:23] <jzaefferer> ScrewUnit used new Function and with() to provide implicit globals, just to avoid making them actually global… I don't want to go in that direction
[08:45:05] <JamesMGreene> right
[08:45:47] <JamesMGreene> Well I'm OK with all three of the latest variations you proposed
[08:45:56] <JamesMGreene> `test(…, function(assert) { var done = assert.async(); … done(); }`
[08:46:02] <JamesMGreene> `asyncTest(..., function(assert) { assert.done(); })`
[08:46:03] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: did you ever look at TestSwarm?
[08:46:08] <JamesMGreene> `asyncTest(..., function(assert, done) {done(); })`
[08:46:20] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, a bit back when it was still alpha
[08:46:43] <jzaefferer> So not using it?
[08:46:44] <JamesMGreene> We setup our own swarm with a fair bit of difficulty but we were having some issues and just shelved it for the time being
[08:47:11] <JamesMGreene> Totally love the red/green/empty grid reporting
[08:47:24] <jzaefferer> Well, it got a lot better :-)
[08:47:29] <JamesMGreene> I've noticed
[08:47:37] <JamesMGreene> Pretty stoked about the BrowserStack integration as well
[08:47:54] <JamesMGreene> I plan to get either TestSwarm or at least Bunyip hooked up in 2013 at work
[08:49:18] <JamesMGreene> Also need to get our legacy JsUnit test suites migrated to QUnit -_-
[08:49:23] <jzaefferer> heh
[08:49:28] <JamesMGreene> Though I've bridged the gap fairly well with this: https://gist.github.com/4371789
[08:51:34] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: What's your experience with mocking frameworks? Have you tried mockjax? How does it compare for you to Sinon?
[08:52:04] <JamesMGreene> I haven't tried mockjax, no
[08:52:14] <JamesMGreene> Huge fan of Sinon
[08:52:33] <JamesMGreene> Some of our teams tried out JsMockito but I wasn't ever really a fan
[08:52:46] <jzaefferer> btw "Correct the summary text on the QUnit HTML to reporter to say "assertions" rather than "tests"." - that's fixed in master
[08:52:48] <JamesMGreene> Other than that, we did a lot of rolling our own mocks (sadly)
[08:53:01] <JamesMGreene> oh good, that's bugged me for years :-P
[08:53:34] <JamesMGreene> Oh yeah, I see it now locally
[08:53:46] <JamesMGreene> Still on 1.10 at work
[08:53:59] <JamesMGreene> Speaking of which, as a newbie: what's your release cycle like?
[08:54:45] <JamesMGreene> quarterly, just intermittent, etc.?
[08:55:44] <jzaefferer> It was monthly for a while, but 1.11 is behind a few months
[08:55:55] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/tags
[08:56:10] <jzaefferer> 4, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10...
[08:56:23] <jzaefferer> really need to release 1.11
[08:56:50] <JamesMGreene> Just a logistics thing or are there some big features/bugs to address first?
[08:57:46] <jzaefferer> would be good to get the deprecation tickets in
[08:58:00] <jzaefferer> the test isn't that pressing or too big
[08:58:27] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/354 and https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/356
[08:59:13] <jzaefferer> Removing QUnit.reset is pretty obvious. The other one has its charm...
[08:59:28] <jzaefferer> do you ever use test(name, expect, callback)?
[08:59:37] <jzaefferer> instead of calling expect(…) directly?
[09:01:01] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: ^
[09:01:43] <JamesMGreene> No, I personally hate the former. I always use `expect`
[09:02:09] <JamesMGreene> :)
[09:02:12] <JamesMGreene> No offense
[09:02:31] <jzaefferer> good
[09:02:33] <JamesMGreene> I can appreciate its succinctness but I think it's much too unclear
[09:02:53] <jzaefferer> so yeah, I want to get those in as deprecated
[09:03:17] <jzaefferer> throwing an error when you use them, pointing out what to use instead
[09:03:35] <jzaefferer> then removing them entirely in one of the next releases
[09:03:41] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, sounds good
[09:03:50] <jzaefferer> without the fallback the errors are terrible, so I'll probably keep it in for a while
[09:03:59] <JamesMGreene> Wasn't aware that `reset` was publicly exposed
[09:04:25] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, maybe `console.error` for 1 release and then upgrade to throwing in the next :)
[09:05:02] <JamesMGreene> Anyway, it's been fun but I need to jet
[09:05:53] <JamesMGreene> tty in 2 weeks if not sooner
[09:06:44] <jzaefferer> already, thanks!
[09:59:17] <ajpiano> content meeting in 2 minutes, probably more like 5, i'll BRB!
[10:05:49] <ajpiano> alrighty then
[10:07:03] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: want to have a meeting or just keep talking to each other, or are those the same thing
[10:07:03] <ajpiano> :p
[10:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think I have anything specific that needs to be discussed.
[10:07:58] <ajpiano> yeah, me neither
[10:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> Good meeting :-)
[10:08:09] <ajpiano> i am going to be working on web-base-tempalte and the contribute content for the next week
[10:08:17] <ajpiano> should have stuff for you to check out on syntax highlighting within the hour
[10:08:42] <ajpiano> oh also the nelson cash guys are going to be starting to put their stuff in github in the next few days, i'm walking him through it again in an hour
[10:08:58] <ajpiano> i'm going to have them work in new-css rather than master
[10:09:30] <ajpiano> seem reasonable  scott_gonzalez ?
[10:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[10:09:47] <ajpiano> ok
[10:09:58] <ajpiano> when do you think we should flip the switch on the brances
[10:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully next week.
[10:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> Just gotta get ThemeRoller updates done.
[10:10:27] <ajpiano> i'm gonna try to look at the custom css from learn and contribute oncethis highlighting stuff is ready for you to look at
[10:10:34] <ajpiano> to get those guys working in new-css
[10:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> Let me know if you need help.
[10:10:51] <ajpiano> will do
[11:03:32] <gseguin> Hi everyone
[11:03:35] * johnbender slams his gavel
[11:03:41] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:03:48] <johnbender> This meeting of he jQuery Mobile dev team will come to order
[11:03:49] <arschmitz> Hi all
[11:03:50] <_|Nix|_> Heippa!
[11:03:52] <johnbender> *the
[11:03:55] <johnbender> there will be no agenda
[11:04:10] <Wilto> [ cue: “Law and Order” segue noise. ]
[11:04:12] <johnbender> we will proceed in alpha order based on irc nick
[11:04:26] <johnbender> arschmitz: proceed
[11:04:36] <arschmitz> hey hey cant forget _|Nix|_
[11:04:42] <johnbender> argh
[11:04:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:04:46] <johnbender> I've already failed
[11:04:49] <gseguin> :)
[11:04:49] <johnbender> arschmitz: go ahead
[11:04:52] <johnbender> we'll just figure it out
[11:04:55] <arschmitz> lol
[11:05:05] <arschmitz> merged rangeslider woo!
[11:05:09] <_|Nix|_> Is '_' < 'a'?
[11:05:10] <Wilto> just gonna hang out and wait until I can object to something
[11:05:22] <johnbender> arschmitz: nice
[11:05:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Congrats!
[11:05:36] <arschmitz> been looking at panels @ toddmparkers request
[11:05:36] <johnbender> anything outstanding that you need help with there?
[11:05:45] <johnbender> re rangeslider
[11:05:48] <arschmitz> johnbender no i think we are good
[11:05:51] <johnbender> cool
[11:05:54] <arschmitz> i want to add a few more tests
[11:05:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: reviewing the code?
[11:05:59] <johnbender> re panels
[11:05:59] <arschmitz> but there are some
[11:06:09] <arschmitz> and fixing some issues i found
[11:06:23] <johnbender> cool
[11:06:44] <Wilto> Zachleat landed some panel tests, yeah?
[11:06:48] <johnbender> yes
[11:06:48] <Wilto> Or is that PR still kicking around?
[11:06:50] <johnbender> wel
[11:06:51] <johnbender> well
[11:06:52] <johnbender> no
[11:06:54] <johnbender> I reviewed the PR
[11:06:58] <johnbender> one tweak and a question
[11:07:01] <arschmitz> one think for any of the filamenteer's here is im curious about the use of on vs _on
[11:07:03] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/objection.png
[11:07:14] <Wilto> WHICH IS IT, JOHNBENDER: “yes” or “no!?”
[11:07:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: _on handles the discrepancy between jquery versions and makes sure that the events are unbound on destroy
[11:07:39] <Wilto> Speak of the zachleat and the zachleat appears.
[11:07:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I wrote the tests for rangeslider... not really experienced with that yet so if you want to give them a quick look and let me know if you have any comments... thanks
[11:07:50] <arschmitz> johnbender: i know but they use on a LOT
[11:07:53] <zachleat> It is I
[11:08:00] <arschmitz> and _on very little
[11:08:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Inside a widget?
[11:08:06] <arschmitz> yes
[11:08:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_on
[11:08:21] <Wilto> Sounds like we ought be using `_on`, yeah>
[11:08:24] <arschmitz> so i was wondering if there was some reason im not aware of or if i could change this
[11:08:25] <_|Nix|_> CRY HAVOC! etc.etc.
[11:08:51] <jlembeck> yeah, seems like we ought to be using _on instead
[11:08:56] <johnbender> arschmitz: we can discuss further in dev
[11:08:58] <arschmitz> that was my thought
[11:09:03] <johnbender> anything else?
[11:09:04] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Inside a widget - definitely.
[11:09:29] <arschmitz> yeah so ill go ahead and make the changes for that then
[11:09:37] <johnbender> arschmitz: awesome
[11:09:38] <arschmitz> and thats all i have
[11:09:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you're up
[11:09:43] <Wilto> Sounds like that’s the plan… [ http://wil.to/_/sunglasses.gif ] …from now _on.
[11:09:53] <_|Nix|_> Not much going on here.
[11:10:01] <arschmitz> Wilto: your just too slick for your own good
[11:10:03] <_|Nix|_> Before the holidays I was heavy on web-ui-fw.
[11:10:28] <_|Nix|_> Now, I've been tracking down that nav issue, but you've got it johnbender ...
[11:10:42] <_|Nix|_> ... so, I'm writing that concat thing for grunt docs.
[11:11:07] <_|Nix|_> ... to concatenate docs/demos/_assets/js/jqm-demos.js and docs/demos/_assets/js/view-source.js
[11:11:36] <_|Nix|_> Then we can revert uGoMobi's temp fix of including both scripts individually.
[11:12:21] <_|Nix|_> I still need to figure out where */js/ is being replaced with */js/jquery.mobile.js and fix it to replace with */js/jquery.mobile.demos.js instead - for the demos, anyway.
[11:12:48] <RWhitbeck> I like how Wilto livens up the meeting room a bit
[11:12:58] <_|Nix|_> That's about it I think. I'll be doing some more web-ui-fw stuff as well.
[11:13:15] <johnbender> cool
[11:13:17] <johnbender> gseguin: ?
[11:13:21] <Wilto> RWhitbeck: I’m the inappropriately-timed comic relief. I’m the Jar-Jar Binks of the jQuery Mobile project.
[11:13:39] <gseguin> yup
[11:13:46] <gseguin> I
[11:13:47] <RWhitbeck> I wouldn't go that far WIlto … you're still tollerable
[11:13:50] * _|Nix|_ cringes
[11:13:50] <gseguin> 'm back
[11:13:57] <Wilto> Just barely.
[11:14:15] <gseguin> I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5198
[11:14:21] <gseguin> and also at typing lessons
[11:14:28] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:14:34] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:14:48] <gseguin> then I'll look into upgrading grunt and then requirejs
[11:14:48] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[11:14:53] <johnbender> yay!
[11:15:00] <johnbender> jlembeck: ?
[11:15:12] <jlembeck> was just testing and working on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163#issuecomment-11803813
[11:15:21] <jlembeck> zachleat's comment in there is correct
[11:15:26] <jlembeck> as far as I can tell
[11:15:37] <johnbender> awesome
[11:15:57] <johnbender> jlembeck: I'm supposed to do some knowledge transfer with you on jquery admin tasks at some point
[11:16:00] <johnbender> starting with the build
[11:16:07] <jlembeck> Sounds good
[11:16:08] <johnbender> just keep it in the back of your mind
[11:16:20] <johnbender> jlembeck: anything else?
[11:16:39] <jlembeck> I'll hop on other bugs that are found when I'm done with this, nothing else immediately
[11:16:43] <johnbender> scottjehl______: you around?
[11:16:58] <johnbender> if not Wilto: you're up
[11:17:06] <gseguin> how many _ does Scott need?
[11:17:07] <RWhitbeck> whoa skipped r
[11:17:20] <Wilto> Burn on RWhitbeck.
[11:17:23] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: sorry, you're welcome to go if scott isn't around
[11:17:54] <Wilto> Anyway, I’m just gonna look into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380
[11:18:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think the IRC client adds another one when he gets kicked off and it tries to reconnect, because he's not around to ghost his old nick.
[11:18:20] <RWhitbeck> Ha no worries.  I've been keeping an eye on the 1.3 commits and planning on how to work that into some blog posts and such.  Other then that planning travel for some of the speaking I'll be doing for jQuery Mobile.
[11:19:04] <uGoMobi> my turn?
[11:20:51] <johnbender> yes if Wilto is done
[11:20:54] <johnbender> uGoMobi: go
[11:20:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:20:59] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. The aforementioned https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380, and looking into a less duct-tape-and-chewing-gum method of testing 3D transforms.
[11:21:03] <Wilto> All yours, uGoMobi.
[11:21:12] <uGoMobi> have been working on CSS for slider / rangeslider and tests for rangeslider
[11:21:30] <uGoMobi> fixed some smaller (mostly CSS) issues
[11:21:50] <uGoMobi> added more demos and will continue with that
[11:22:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Have you had a chance to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5409?
[11:22:10] <uGoMobi> have been debugging slide-panel on Android too
[11:22:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can reproduce on both Linux and Windows FF
[11:22:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Great!
[11:23:04] <uGoMobi> I will assign it to me and look into it
[11:24:02] <uGoMobi> about slide-panel... not sure who is going to work on that now, but if needed I can look into that position fixed issue
[11:24:40] <uGoMobi> that's it
[11:25:51] <gseguin> johnbender: you're next
[11:26:01] <johnbender> zachleat: ?
[11:26:10] <gseguin> oh oops, sorry Zach
[11:26:28] <zachleat> Yo
[11:26:46] <zachleat> Making that last change to the panel tests
[11:26:57] <zachleat> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5412
[11:28:21] <johnbender> alright
[11:28:37] <johnbender> No work last week
[11:28:41] <johnbender> company shutdown
[11:28:42] <johnbender> well
[11:28:44] <uGoMobi> I forgot one thing
[11:28:46] <johnbender> aside from that quick code review
[11:28:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: go ahead
[11:29:54] <uGoMobi> sorry disconnected
[11:30:00] <uGoMobi> this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5410
[11:30:13] <uGoMobi> I promised to discuss with team
[11:30:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi: what does he want to change it to?
[11:31:06] <uGoMobi> he want to make it an option
[11:31:15] <uGoMobi> I am not in favor of that
[11:31:23] <johnbender> hmm
[11:31:30] <johnbender> I'm not either but that's an interestind problem
[11:31:45] <uGoMobi> but maybe we should change the ui-collapsible-heading-toggle element a div instead of anchor
[11:31:45] <johnbender> it does break with our PE approach to change that
[11:32:00] <johnbender> ah it's added in jS anyway
[11:32:02] <johnbender> *JS
[11:32:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well I'll leave that up to the semantic police
[11:32:25] <johnbender> ie Wilto
[11:32:28] <johnbender> who isn't here :/
[11:32:32] <uGoMobi> right
[11:32:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: why don't you loop them in on that
[11:32:40] <johnbender> since it's markup
[11:32:50] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5410
