[14:00:30] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!!
[14:00:44] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, nashvail, kristyjy
[14:00:50] <kristyjy> hello
[14:00:55] <sfrisk> bonjour, allo, and all that jazz
[14:00:59] <nashvail> Hey
[14:01:24] <arschmitz> hi
[14:01:53] <sfrisk> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:01:57] <sfrisk> first up is tables
[14:02:03] <sfrisk> which I know kristyjy was working on
[14:02:18] <sfrisk> but we discovered something last night that could be problematic - unless arschmitz has an easy fix
[14:02:28] <sfrisk> kristyjy - take it away
[14:02:30] <arschmitz> hi
[14:03:04] <kristyjy> yeah the typography variables in jsass have dashes in them which doesn't seem to work when referencing those variables
[14:03:18] <kristyjy> font-default is the example I was having trouble with
[14:03:37] <arschmitz> can you show me how you were doing it
[14:03:46] <arschmitz> its probably a bug ill just need to fix
[14:03:48] <sfrisk> we tried the usual ['font-default'] trick, but it has issues parsing that in the sass side of things
[14:04:21] <sfrisk> that it thought instead of the variable, it was the string ['font-default'], or something along those lines
[14:04:30] <kristyjy> "font-size": () => "typography.font-default
[14:04:34] <kristyjy> "font-size": () => "typography['font-default']",
[14:04:43] <kristyjy> both threw errors
[14:07:21] <arschmitz> well .font-default cant work in js
[14:07:31] <arschmitz> your daying typography.font -  default
[14:07:52] <arschmitz> only lisps allow dashes in variable names
[14:08:08] <arschmitz> the second one should work so there must be a bug
[14:08:09] <sfrisk> yeah that's why we tried the ['font-default']
[14:08:20] <arschmitz> can you open a bug on jsass
[14:08:46] <sfrisk> this one? https://github.com/arschmitz/JSass-vars
[14:08:51] <arschmitz> yup
[14:09:11] <sfrisk> I can do that real quick
[14:09:15] <arschmitz> thank you
[14:09:17] <kristyjy> cool
[14:09:29] <arschmitz> i have an idea what this issue is already
[14:10:32] <arschmitz> so question though
[14:10:41] <arschmitz> i thought we decided to camelcase all keys?
[14:10:58] <arschmitz> wasnt that in the styleguide someone made for jsass
[14:11:00] <sfrisk> I was trying to figure that out when we ran into the issue
[14:11:22] <sfrisk> because everywhere in our jsass right now, it uses dashes
[14:11:34] <sfrisk> to mimic the scss, not camelcase
[14:12:01] <arschmitz> i swear i remember that but could be wrong or backwards
[14:12:41] <arschmitz> where was that anyway
[14:12:45] <arschmitz> i think geekman-rohit did it
[14:12:59] <sfrisk> might be in an issue
[14:13:08] <sfrisk> when I saw the problem last night
[14:13:18] <sfrisk> I was like "welp, we either fix jsass, or we enforce cammelcase
[14:13:31] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/135
[14:13:34] <sfrisk> figured it was better to have the conversation here
[14:14:04] <sfrisk> looks like I brought up we needed consistency
[14:14:08] <arschmitz> so right now camelcase follows geekmans suggestion there
[14:14:31] <sfrisk> his wrong example uses camelcase
[14:14:33] <kristyjy> "scss variables to be hyphen-separated for multiple words and not camelCased"
[14:14:46] <arschmitz> yes sorry thats what i meant
[14:14:52] <sfrisk> it's a tuesday.
[14:14:54] <kristyjy> just making sure I wasn't crazy lol
[14:15:03] <sfrisk> my brain never starts working until at least thursday
[14:15:05] <arschmitz> so i can probably fix this in jsass
[14:15:32] <arschmitz> but for this second if its a blocker i would just make it camelcase
[14:15:45] <arschmitz> and put a comment about why until i can get it fixed
[14:15:50] <sfrisk> that works
[14:16:00] <sfrisk> I think that variable needs to get changed in 5 places though
[14:16:09] <kristyjy> should we make a separate PR for that?
[14:16:10] <sfrisk> or we could just call it "default" instead of "font-default"
[14:16:45] <arschmitz> sfrisk: remember variables are global in scss
[14:17:16] <arschmitz> so things like "default" are bad
[14:17:23] <kristyjy> yeah but that would be typography.default
[14:17:51] <kristyjy> which we are using everywhere else.. color.default btn.default etc
[14:17:54] <sfrisk> well with the way you did jsass it would be typography-default
[14:18:05] <sfrisk> right now it is typography-font-default
[14:20:36] <sfrisk> however, we could just camel case it for now
[14:22:59] <geekman-rohit> @arschmitz I remember we agreed on dashed
[14:23:02] <geekman-rohit> dashes*
[14:23:08] <geekman-rohit> again it was a loong time ago
[14:23:17] <geekman-rohit> so I could be wrong
[14:23:19] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: yes we did
[14:23:43] <arschmitz> sfrisk: right forgot
[14:24:00] <arschmitz> default does seem fine then
[14:24:28] <sfrisk> okay, updated the agenda with that
[14:24:38] <sfrisk> once we switch that, you should be good to, right kristyjy?
[14:25:30] <kristyjy> yeah. The only comments I see unresolved in that PR are to make a few things variables so unless anyone remembers something I don't I should be good to go
[14:27:41] <sfrisk> okay, next up, nashvail's inputs
[14:27:55] <sfrisk> which actually, I should probably bring up normalize first
[14:28:01] <sfrisk> since that's causing some display issues
[14:28:09] <nashvail> Yes the issue is still open
[14:28:17] <sfrisk> did you have a chance to work on that arschmitz? or do you want me to do that?
[14:28:35] <arschmitz> im sorry im terrible i didnt get to new job was a distraction
[14:28:37] <arschmitz> lol
[14:28:56] <sfrisk> it happens
[14:29:02] <sfrisk> I'm the last person to point fingers
[14:29:53] <sfrisk> do you still want to do it? or I can do i
[14:31:01] <arschmitz> ill do it
[14:31:15] <sfrisk> k
[14:31:24] <sfrisk> we'll try to get that into master over the week
[14:31:33] <sfrisk> that way nashvail can pull that into inputs
[14:31:48] <nashvail> Sure
[14:33:35] <sfrisk> okay, is there anything else really to discuss?
[14:33:41] <sfrisk> since inputs are blocked by normalize
[14:34:18] <geekman-rohit> grid
[14:34:26] <geekman-rohit> nashvail wanted to start some work on that
[14:34:41] <nashvail> Yeah I am still going through everything
[14:34:53] <sfrisk> I know there was a long discussion about grid on the issues
[14:35:20] <sfrisk> back when we started we wanted flexbox, but the support wasn't there yet
[14:35:47] <nashvail> Also supporting ie ruled flexbox out no?
[14:35:55] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/5
[14:36:49] <nashvail> That's the one
[14:40:11] <sfrisk> what else do we have for phase one work that's not done?
[14:40:16] <sfrisk> besides grid
[14:42:28] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/milestone/1
[14:43:34] <sfrisk> flex box support levels: http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox
[14:43:42] <sfrisk> in theory - we could use flexbox
[14:43:44] <nashvail> I have used shadows for the consistent active state styling across browser
[14:43:52] <nashvail> Hope it'll solve the issue
[14:44:40] <sfrisk> we do have selects to work on too
[14:44:56] <kristyjy> yeah the only thing with flex box is no IE8 which I think we were originally planning to support if I remember correctly?
[14:45:11] <kristyjy> if that's changed I think we should definitely use flex box
[14:46:54] <sfrisk> we were, but that was the discussion we had 2 years ago
[14:47:11] <sfrisk> @arschmitz, what is mobile and UI's support policy right now?
[14:49:54] <sfrisk> currently mobile supports IE8
[14:50:02] <sfrisk> so maybe if we had a flexbox and traditional?
[14:50:11] <sfrisk> or is that overkill?
[14:51:35] <sfrisk> or everyone is busy
[14:52:09] <nashvail> IMO That won't be a overkill but definitely will take some work
[14:52:09] <sfrisk> we can pick up this discussion next week
[14:52:23] <sfrisk> you could focus on one half of grid maybe?
[14:52:39] <sfrisk> we could file issues for flexbox support, and then the grid div method
[14:52:46] <nashvail> Yeah that could be done
[14:53:01] <nashvail> It would be a great learning experience actually you know
[14:55:04] <sfrisk> do you want to create tickets for the traditional div based approach, and a flexbox approach
[14:55:14] <sfrisk> and then just let us know which one you'll work on this week?
[14:56:00] <nashvail> Sure I can do that
[14:56:18] <nashvail> Just got a couple of university stuff to take care of this week
[14:56:36] <nashvail> Might be a little slow
[14:56:50] <sfrisk> okay
[14:57:27] <sfrisk> on that note, our hour is up
[14:57:31] <sfrisk> see peeps later
