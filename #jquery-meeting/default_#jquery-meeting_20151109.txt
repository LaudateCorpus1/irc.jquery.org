[12:01:06] <arthurvr> hey everyone
[12:01:16] <timmywil> http://vectorbelly.com/ON177.gif
[12:01:43] <markelog> hey-hey
[12:02:33] <timmywil> We are down to 11 open 3.0 issues that don't yet have PRs
[12:02:57] <timmywil> progress is great there. Need to get this 1.12/2.2 done tho.
[12:03:16] <timmywil> branches have been created. markelog: how's the list coming?
[12:03:25] <m_gol> present
[12:04:04] <markelog> I was moving this week, which did get pretty hectic, in this week though, i have some time, so starting today, sorry for delay :/
[12:04:16] <m_gol> can you paste the link to the doc?
[12:04:27] <m_gol> markelog: if you don't have time please tell us :)
[12:04:39] <markelog> ok
[12:04:39] <m_gol> we don't have a lot of time so we need to start planning asap
[12:05:10] <m_gol> I have a free Wednesday - the Polish Independence day which means there will be a huge Nationalists march in Warsaw which means I'm staying home
[12:06:08] <DaveMethvin> here, sorry
[12:06:16] <timmywil> hi DaveMethvin!
[12:06:21] <m_gol> markelog: so if you can't find time before Wednesday then ping me & I can do it
[12:06:35] <markelog> okay!
[12:06:36] <m_gol> markelog: you can ping me before that as well if you already know ;)
[12:06:47] <markelog> okay m_gol
[12:06:54] <m_gol> timmywil: can you paste a link to the agenda?
[12:06:58] <DaveMethvin> i have weds off as well, ping me if you need anything
[12:07:00] <timmywil> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BadwSO6Sn91RBfr05s77r81ncEi0oMBJ5mZS-k215vg/edit#
[12:07:03] <m_gol> thx
[12:07:27] <timmywil> show/hide behaviors are filled in. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UaISjcS3UMxVJ7eSBIXtK-jqF8Grl67w640peCqlkoc/edit#gid=0
[12:07:30] <markelog> okay
[12:07:42] <timmywil> I like it
[12:07:52] <m_gol> I'd like to *not* backport https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2502 & https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2501 to 1.12; if no one disagrees I'll remove the milestones
[12:08:21] <DaveMethvin> agree with you on those m_gol
[12:08:22] <timmywil> m_gol: fine with me
[12:09:03] <timmywil> I think the tables are in a good enough place that we could start a PR.
[12:09:35] <gibson042> still missing animated, but I agree
[12:09:49] <timmywil> with markelog focusing on 1.12/2.2, I think gibson042 or I should take it.
[12:10:04] <timmywil> if you're cool with that, markelog
[12:10:13] <markelog> okay
[12:10:16] <markelog> we need an animated table too right?
[12:10:19] <markelog> before the pr
[12:10:19] <markelog> ?
[12:10:32] <timmywil> we need it eventually, but I think we can start with what we have now
[12:10:44] <timmywil> will probably make filling in the animated table easier
[12:10:52] <gibson042> you're such a dreamer
[12:11:15] <markelog> okay
[12:11:22] <markelog> i'm yes man, apparently )
[12:11:27] <DaveMethvin> :)
[12:11:49] <timmywil> gibson042: trying to think of a clever response. I got nothing.
[12:12:37] <timmywil> There's one unassigned ticket left for 3.0 that either doesn't already have a PR or won't be covered by another ticket. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2546
[12:13:05] <timmywil> My list is getting small, so I could take that one if gibson042 wants to take show/hide
[12:13:11] <gibson042> works for me
[12:13:46] <timmywil> Ok, and then we've got some PRs that can land
[12:14:03] <timmywil> I haven't stopped thinking of "sportsing" since I saw gibson042's Golf PR
[12:14:24] <gibson042> I sportsed it pretty good
[12:14:44] <timmywil> LGTM
[12:15:16] <timmywil> And the contributing one. I did an update to the non-px dimensions one for yall's review
[12:15:36] <DaveMethvin> i was trying to bikeshed a better name for "completed" since it's tri-state but couldn't come up with anything
[12:16:32] <gibson042> yeah, I figured it was good since there are only two checks for the initial "not sent" state
[12:17:05] <timmywil> It's "completed" from a certain point of view
[12:17:30] <DaveMethvin> in that "i did not have sex with that woman" sort of day
[12:17:32] <DaveMethvin> way*
[12:17:45] <timmywil> ha
[12:17:48] <DaveMethvin> but yeah it looks good
[12:17:56] <timmywil> didnotinhale = true
[12:18:51] <DaveMethvin> sorry i have to run across the room, mention me if you need something
[12:18:58] <m_gol> TestSwarm update: I added jobs for 1.12-stable & 2.2-stable, I also added periodic ones. I disabled the compat periodic one.
[12:19:15] <markelog> awesome!
[12:19:21] <timmywil> So, we'll get cracking on 1.12/2.2 this week. Thanks for keeping a good pace for 3.0.
[12:19:25] <m_gol> we have one ajax failure in Android 4.0 on master but I can't reproduce it on a local 4.0 emulator so we can re-check later
[12:19:34] <markelog> did think we would have a testswarm for new minor
[12:19:42] <markelog> *we wouldn't
[12:19:49] <m_gol> markelog: why not? we need to test it
[12:20:20] <markelog> i guessed it would be a hassle to add
[12:20:29] <m_gol> not really
[12:20:43] <m_gol> the way I've set it up a while ago it's quite easy to add new branches ;)
[12:20:49] <m_gol> with custom browser sets
[12:20:58] <markelog> do you have a local swarm
[12:21:00] <markelog> ?
[12:21:01] <m_gol> no
[12:21:34] <markelog> ok-ok
[12:21:50] <timmywil> nice that it wasn't difficult
[12:22:11] <timmywil> anything else?
[12:22:20] <markelog> on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/API-design-guidelines
[12:22:21] <m_gol> about the list
[12:22:37] <m_gol> we should have it on Wednesday, either markelog or me will create one
[12:22:45] <timmywil> sounds good
[12:22:49] <markelog> we might want to change "jQuery Core tenets" to something more friendly?
[12:22:50] <m_gol> it'd be good to meet next week with concrete opinions :)
[12:22:53] <m_gol> so that we can procede
[12:23:01] <m_gol> markelog: that was my observation as well :-)
[12:23:05] <markelog> since not a lot of ppl know what "jQuery Core" means
[12:23:07] <m_gol> that's the first time I've heard that word
[12:23:15] <markelog> that too )
[12:23:19] <m_gol> ah, I meant tenets, not Core ;)
[12:23:21] <m_gol> but right
[12:23:27] <timmywil> we could keep using the word "guidelines" instead of tenets
[12:23:38] <markelog> or "Principles"
[12:23:47] <m_gol> both sound fine to me
[12:24:25] <markelog> i guess "guidelines" is not mandatory thing right?
[12:24:35] <markelog> but "Principles" are?
[12:24:59] <timmywil> either is fine with me. Principles can still be flexible.
[12:25:11] <markelog> it is a bikeshedding though :-)
[12:25:15] <timmywil> ya
[12:25:17] <DaveMethvin> guidelines or principles +1 with me
[12:25:35] <timmywil> ok, thanks all
[12:25:46] <markelog> see ya
