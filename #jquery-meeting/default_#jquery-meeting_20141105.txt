[08:30:27] <jzaefferer> Ping JamesMGreene leobalter Krinkle|detached gibson042 - QUnit meeting!
[08:30:49] <gibson042> ready
[08:31:45] <jzaefferer> gibson042: hi there! I don't know if anyone else is around... do you have any ideas or complaints about QUnit?
[08:32:14] <gibson042> I think I'm good at the moment
[08:33:37] <jzaefferer> alright
[08:44:58] <leobalter> jzaefferer: I'm here, sorry for being late again. Just got more house stuff shipped at home
[08:54:13] <jzaefferer> hey there leobalter. I still need to review your updated PR.
[08:54:24] <jzaefferer> any idea what your schedule looks like for the next few weeks?
[09:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: jzaefferer gnarf kborchers mikesherov petersendidit tj_vantoll
[09:00:59] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:02] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:01:06] <jzaefferer> hallo
[09:01:58] <kborchers> hey
[09:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> I guess mikesherov won't make it again.
[09:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> And I have a feeling nobody else wants to look into the regression.
[09:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to catch him later.
[09:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers said he couldn't make it today, so no update on the AMD loading.
[09:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything to discuss for classes?
[09:04:05] <arschmitz> I just pushed all the updates from jzaefferer comments including updating all the tests
[09:04:13] <arschmitz> so that should be ready for a round of review
[09:04:22] <jzaefferer> okay, I'll put it on my list
[09:04:37] <jzaefferer> is that just classes or also button?
[09:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> Does that include https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1372 ?
[09:04:54] <mikesherov> I'm here
[09:04:59] <arschmitz> button ill push the changes to shortly i need to rebase it with the classes changes then its good
[09:05:04] <mikesherov> I looked into it
[09:05:08] <mikesherov> going to fix it shortly
[09:05:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yes
[09:05:12] <mikesherov> it was a head scratcher
[09:05:28] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: let me know when you push that, just comment on each PR after you push
[09:05:31] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[09:05:40] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i already pushed classes
[09:06:02] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay
[09:06:14] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ill comment on button once thats pushed as well
[09:07:17] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: if #1372 is in your branch, can you close the other PR?
[09:07:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[09:07:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Good to hear :-)
[09:07:59] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: anything on removing AMD wrappers in minified files?
[09:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You're also going to handle http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10534 soon, right?
[09:08:23] <mikesherov> I'll do it when I land the connectToSortable fix
[09:08:30] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: No. I realized I have no idea how to actually do that.
[09:08:34] <mikesherov> like, in 5 minutes
[09:09:24] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: okay. Rafael messed around with AMD wrappers a lot, could discuss with him when he's back
[09:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: :-)
[09:10:00] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: while you're here, anything on effects rewrite?
[09:10:06] <tj_vantoll> Ok cool. I'm not Grunt savvy enough to know how to do what needs to be done.
[09:10:13] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: had my fingers in a lot of pies lately
[09:10:18] <mikesherov> I hope to wrap it up this week
[09:10:22] <mikesherov> but I've said that before
[09:10:33] <mikesherov> if I find enough time, then yes
[09:10:50] <mikesherov> it's basically one regression, and one feature away from complete
[09:10:57] <jzaefferer> so close :-)
[09:11:16] <mikesherov> it's just about scraping together enough hours to do it
[09:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> Don't make me come to your house and tie you to a chair with your laptop in front of you :-P
[09:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> I've put together a rough roadmap for next year: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/3c1c149cab8bcfb19d85
[09:13:03] <jzaefferer> Speaking of Scott forcing developers to do his bidding, we have a roadmap proposal for next year: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/3c1c149cab8bcfb19d85
[09:13:16] <arschmitz> HA HA HA!
[09:13:17] <jzaefferer> (too slow)
[09:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> We're just looking for confirmation that the order and timelines seem reasonable.
[09:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> The public roadmap will continue to only list tasks per release with no dates.
[09:14:17] <jzaefferer> I'm hoping to increase the hours on my contract to spend more time on UI, besides QUnit and Globalize
[09:14:30] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:15:23] <mikesherov> I think some of the order of operations that we agreed upon in chicago for interactions is off
[09:15:38] <mikesherov> But that's probably too specific to discuss right now?
[09:16:03] <mikesherov> I thought that we would ship mouse and interaction side by side
[09:16:28] <mikesherov> so that the new draggable and the new droppable good get into the world ahead of the rest of the interactions?
[09:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we will.
[09:16:33] <mikesherov> ok, just making sure
[09:16:46] <mikesherov> the roadmap seems solid to me
[09:16:53] <tj_vantoll> +1
[09:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I did have one other thing.
[09:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10615
[09:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> Mouse: Deprecate distance and delay
[09:18:28] <arschmitz> i have one minor thing too
[09:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it's probably not worth doing at this point, since interaction is coming soon.
[09:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> And that will effectively deprecate all of mouse.
[09:19:06] <jzaefferer> Seems fine to close that
[09:19:16] <arschmitz> yeah makes sense
[09:19:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: what did you have?
[09:20:07] <mikesherov> right, new interactions deprecate those methods on the individual widgets
[09:20:28] <tj_vantoll> I thought that new interactions removed those options though.
[09:20:54] <arschmitz> so with all the references saved for elements and classes we could make classes cleanup automatically anything it handles in destroy
[09:21:02] <tj_vantoll> So wasn't the idea to deprecate them now so that interactions could remove them without replicating the functionality?
[09:21:08] <arschmitz> does anyone think we should do this?
[09:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, did I file this just as a docs issue?
[09:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> So that we can remove them in 1.13.0 with interaction?
[09:22:10] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Yeah. #10615 wasn't about removing those options, just about marking them as deprecated.
[09:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> We don't write any actual code for this, we just put in the upgrade guide and changelog that they're deprecated.
[09:22:25] <tj_vantoll> Because with interactions they're gone.
[09:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that's easy. I'll just close as fixed :-)
[09:22:32] <tj_vantoll> :)
[09:22:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Sometimes the order in which you remove elements matters. That may be widget-specific.
[09:22:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: does not matter
[09:22:56] <arschmitz> you can either do a check with contains
[09:23:04] <arschmitz> or the refrence still exists no matter what
[09:23:12] <arschmitz> so you remove it from a detached dom node
[09:24:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Just be careful to put back DOM nodes that were part of the original markup. For example, IIUC menu items now have wrapper divs. So, when you remove the wrapper, you must not also remove the div it did wrap.
[09:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> I think we should look into it after everything else is in order.
[09:24:57] <scott_gonzalez> Then it'll be a lot easier to see the benefit.
[09:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: He's not talking about removing elements at all.
[09:25:21] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, and we can always provide default behaviour, to be overriden in cases where it doesn't work.
[09:25:24] <arschmitz> i have no strong opinion either way
[09:25:40] <arschmitz> just putting the question out if we should do this or not
[09:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> He's just talking about doing: foreach classes as class, remove class from associated element
[09:26:02] <jzaefferer> Sounds like we should give it a try in one widget
[09:26:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, just removing classes ... OK.
[09:26:27] <gabriel_schulhof> May not make sense for elements that are gonna get removed anyway.
[09:26:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you can check that
[09:26:54] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so the question is does the abstraction provide enough benefit.
[09:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> Which we'll be able to judge a lot better by reviewing just that portion.
[09:27:21] <gabriel_schulhof> I think we should look at each widget's _destroy(), and if we see a common pattern, we can abstract that out.
[09:27:38] <arschmitz> i agree with scott_gonzalez
[09:27:46] <arschmitz> we should finalize the rest of the implementation first
[09:27:51] <arschmitz> then look at this by it self
[09:28:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, for sure. That's when we'll be able to notice common patterns in _destroy().
[09:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks everyone.
[09:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
