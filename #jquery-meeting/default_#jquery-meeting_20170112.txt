[14:14:07] <arschmitz> very positive

[14:19:13] <cgack> awesome. Thanks for tagging the alpha arschmitz!
[14:19:32] <cogwurx> unfortunately, I've got nothing...haven't been involved much since my graphics commit and just hanging out in the meetings...so if there is anything that you'd like for me to help out with, let me know
[14:19:44] <cogwurx> thanks for all your hard work on this arschmitz!
[14:34:43] <apsdehal> Hey all
[14:35:00] <apsdehal> I will make the website changes as soon as I am back
[14:38:17] <arschmitz> @cogwurx one thing you could look at
[14:38:27] <arschmitz> demo.jquerymobile.com/1.5-alpha.1
[14:38:34] <arschmitz>  http://demo.jquerymobile.com/1.5-alpha.1/
[14:38:44] <arschmitz>  http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.5-alpha.1/
[14:38:57] <arschmitz> hrm
[14:39:22] <arschmitz> oh forgot the 0 http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.5.0-alpha.1/
[14:39:32] <arschmitz> its showing version dev
[14:41:15] <cogwurx> you mean in the footer?
[14:41:31] <cogwurx> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.5.0-alpha.1/ that's where I see the version dev
[14:41:49] <cogwurx> The other links are redirecting me to the main jquery site
[15:03:04] <arschmitz> @cogwurx yes exactly
[15:11:34] <cogwurx> okay, should be an easy fix.
[15:11:42] <cogwurx> what do you want to put in it's place?
[15:11:52] <cogwurx> Version Alpha?
