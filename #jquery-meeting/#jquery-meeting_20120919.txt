[09:02:03] <Krinkle> Hey
[09:02:04] <kborchers> yo
[09:02:10] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf
[09:04:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i thought i used to be able to edit the agenda but can't now
[09:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Are you logged in?
[09:05:14] <kborchers> yep
[09:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes Google is stupid
[09:05:32] <kborchers> says view only at the top
[09:05:39] <scott_gonzalez> I only see Anonymous User 67 as viewing.
[09:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> Now Anonymous user 68 :-P
[09:06:41] <kborchers> weird … i logged out and back in
[09:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...you didn't have permission.
[09:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> I just added you.
[09:07:48] <kborchers> ok, thanks
[09:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's interesting that if you don't have permission to edit, you show up as anonymous even if you're logged in.
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, let's get started.
[09:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> I created the single file XML dump for the API sites.
[09:09:03] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/resources/api.xml
[09:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> It actually contains more data than the existing one from the core site.
[09:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> It includes slugs and descriptions for categories.
[09:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> I also improved support for marking which version something was added/deprecated/removed.
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> You can't see it on stage yet becuase I need to update everything to use grunt-jquery-content 0.5.1.
[09:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> I also updated all of the 1.8 docs.
[09:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> Next is getting the 1.8 site set up.
[09:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: download builder + ThemeRoller update?
[09:13:18] <rxaviers> Now they both are working on jqueryui.com (wordpress)
[09:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> Does that mean you're (almost) ready to merge to master?
[09:14:37] <rxaviers> Some parts of the frontend are dynamically fetched. The jqueryui.com and download.jqueryui.com are two separate servers. So, I've add a host variable in the themeroller as well.
[09:14:46] <rxaviers> and fixed the request by using jsonp
[09:15:26] <rxaviers> Almost. Sorry that my predictions of getting it done was far close of what it took. But,
[09:15:51] <rxaviers> closer than before. hehe. TODOs are:
[09:16:09] <rxaviers> - check download and themeroller former bugs
[09:16:47] <rxaviers> - better error handling of download builder
[09:17:04] <rxaviers> - fix FIXMEs (several minor things)
[09:17:29] <rxaviers> Ah, I've also implemented the scoping feature in download builder
[09:17:56] <rxaviers> - needs some style fixs on themeroller
[09:18:23] <rxaviers> Right now, it's possible to deploy it (jqueryui.com grunt deploy) and check it out
[09:19:53] <rxaviers> I think that's it.
[09:20:26] <rxaviers> My plan is to finish those above, cleanup the branch and let you guys know for code review (if the case)
[09:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> Jumping around a bit, kborchers: update on demos/visual tests?
[09:24:33] <kborchers> just that everything seems to work in latest chrome and FF. plan to test latest Opera, Safari and IE + IE6 tonight
[09:24:53] <kborchers> latest IE being 9 not 10
[09:25:01] <kborchers> unless i should test 10 as well
[09:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> 9 is fine.
[09:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> I started working on jqueryui.com homepage: http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[09:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> I've got some more done locally, but not ready to push yet.
[09:26:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure how i feel about this font http://cl.ly/image/0P3r3H1o3M1u
[09:27:26] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I don't like it.
[09:27:34] <kborchers> i don't think i do either
[09:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> But to be totally honest, I'm tired of making design chagnes.
[09:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> What's one more override? :-P
[09:29:19] <kborchers> i don't mind playing with stuff like that after testing is done … didn't we talk yesterday about me doing something else?
[09:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> You said you wanted to make some tweaks on blog.jqueryui.com.
[09:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which bring us to the next item on the agenda...
[09:31:29] <kborchers> oh right … yep i'll just make other style changes when i do that
[09:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> stage.blog.jqueryui.com has the new design applied to the existing site.
[09:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: The blog is running off of https://github.com/jquery/blog.jqueryui.com-theme
[09:32:23] <kborchers> oh … ok
[09:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> We had to do that so we could apply it to the exisitng site in order to reduce the amount of work to deploy.
[09:33:20] <kborchers> gotcha
[09:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll need another WordPress checkout and then replace wp-content/themes with that repo.
[09:34:18] <kborchers> fun :)
[09:37:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything on the agenda.
[09:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> Just so everyone is clear, once the items that have been discussed today are complete, we're ready to release 1.9.0.
[09:38:47] <scott_gonzalez> I will be at Strange Loop from Sunday - Wednesday, so my availability will be limited.
[09:39:24] * rxaviers will focus on finishing it this week
