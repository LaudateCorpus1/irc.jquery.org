[09:02:52] <DaveMethvin> m_gol orkel jaubourg rwaldron mikesherov timmywil gibson042 meeting time!
[09:03:00] <orkel> Hey-hey!
[09:03:14] <DaveMethvin> hey guys, sorry i've been so gone lately
[09:03:18] <timmywil> wat, a meeting?
[09:03:27] <DaveMethvin> vacation, plus traveling all over
[09:03:39] <DaveMethvin> internet access not so good
[09:03:45] <DaveMethvin> but now i'm home!
[09:03:51] <timmywil> are you all tan now?
[09:04:01] <DaveMethvin> no, still pale and sad looking
[09:04:09] <timmywil> oh ok
[09:04:21] <DaveMethvin> but the cats are happy i am home at least
[09:04:37] <jaubourg> OMG CATS MEMES!!!!1111
[09:04:55] <DaveMethvin> ok, so i want to get a patch release out here, so we can get the IE focus bug off our backs
[09:05:13] <timmywil> +1
[09:05:15] <DaveMethvin> i think we have the important bugs dealt with, either already landed or a PR ready
[09:05:30] <DaveMethvin> anything that you think we should do for this go-round that isn't accounted for?
[09:07:01] <DaveMethvin> just looking at the open tix here
[09:07:07] <orkel> i'm a bit worried about our swarm/test situation – http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[09:07:51] <orkel> It looks like we are falling for long time now
[09:08:08] <DaveMethvin> agreed, it's a mess
[09:08:21] <timmywil> is it swarm or the core?
[09:08:24] <timmywil> -the
[09:08:27] <DaveMethvin> and it's extra frustrating since the tests aren't broken afaict
[09:08:38] <orkel> plus we test stuff for browsers that we do not support anymore like old FF and Chrome
[09:09:25] <timmywil> ajax tests seem fine locally, but it seems the ajax test that is timing out has to do with something remote, which may be an issue in the swarm
[09:09:36] <orkel> i checked some stuff out, we are falling because nginx can't process post request on static failes
[09:09:54] <DaveMethvin> and that should have been changed when they moved servers
[09:09:55] <orkel> nginx return 502 for them
[09:10:01] <DaveMethvin> by default it does that
[09:10:19] <jaubourg> we need to test cors somehow
[09:10:23] <timmywil> also, I think testswarm-browserstack needed an update
[09:10:29] <timmywil> or still needs
[09:10:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:10:42] <DaveMethvin> there's a ticket for it :)
[09:10:50] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: which one?
[09:10:55] <jaubourg> but yeah, it's not reassuring for a release :P
[09:11:07] <timmywil> cors or testswarm-browserstack?
[09:11:24] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13371 timmywil
[09:11:57] <timmywil> ah , I see, I think jörn already did that tho
[09:12:10] <jaubourg> timmywil: the whole testswarm situation
[09:12:21] <timmywil> ok
[09:12:24] <DaveMethvin> so i am pretty sure i can get through this release with local testing, but yeah our swarm testing is useless right now
[09:12:31] <DaveMethvin> esp for ajax
[09:13:08] <m_gol> hey, sorry for being late
[09:13:10] <timmywil> specifically, browsers spun up by testswarm-browserstack occassionally hang and do nothing
[09:13:15] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol
[09:13:26] <jaubourg> hey m_gol
[09:13:30] <_orkel> hey
[09:13:38] <DaveMethvin> there was talk in portland of dumping testswarm altogether
[09:13:48] <timmywil> for what?
[09:13:50] <_orkel> Krinkle is working on that
[09:13:54] <jaubourg> what's the alternative?
[09:13:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:14:04] <_orkel> but it will not came out very soon
[09:14:06] <DaveMethvin> saucelabs for example
[09:14:13] <_orkel> he said something about a year or so
[09:14:21] <timmywil> saucelabs is a browserstack alternative
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> i dunno how soon or how well we can fix these issues
[09:14:44] <jaubourg> is the problem browserstack or testswarm itself?
[09:14:59] <jaubourg> (sorry for not following properly on this)
[09:15:47] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg i am not sure
[09:15:54] <DaveMethvin> before they moved servers the prob was the server
[09:16:05] <_orkel> both, browserstack does not have some features, like understanding when tests are finished
[09:16:08] <DaveMethvin> i know gnarf had to configure ngnix to handle posts to static pags
[09:16:58] <m_gol> one just-before-release thing - shouldn't we tag a Sizzle version included in stable jQuery ones? it's not reassuring to see *-pre Sizzle versions appear in stable jQuery releases (and that's what's written in the unminified code in a Sizzle banner comment)
[09:17:11] <DaveMethvin> so just to wrap up the discussion on this week's releases, i will be landing a few of the patches today and doing the release tomorrow after testing locally
[09:17:24] <DaveMethvin> let me know if you want to add anything
[09:17:24] <jaubourg> ok
[09:17:52] <DaveMethvin> timmywil added a question about how we document the stuff related to node
[09:18:04] <DaveMethvin> those have always been kind of tricky
[09:18:05] <_orkel> i want to land three PR – https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/940 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1299 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1284
[09:18:05] <m_gol> especially that Sizzle does have stable versions :)
[09:18:35] <_orkel> if that okey with DaveMethvin
[09:18:48] <timmywil> m_gol: we've been tagging Sizzle releases after jQuery releases, but we could do it just before a release
[09:19:04] <timmywil> put Sizzle releases in quotes
[09:19:30] <gibson042> I would prefer jQuery to reference Sizzle tags instead of commit hashes
[09:19:54] <DaveMethvin> orkel, 1299 and 1284 look good, what's the story with 940?
[09:19:55] <m_gol> gibson042: yeah, that would be the best
[09:19:59] <m_gol> didn't know it's possible :)
[09:20:02] <timmywil> gibson042: that may not be realistic
[09:20:16] <m_gol> it seems more reasonable to have a stable Sizzle included so I'm for reversing the tagging order
[09:20:21] <timmywil> we don't want to have to tag Sizzle every time we fix a jQuery bug
[09:20:33] <DaveMethvin> agreed on that timmywil
[09:20:39] <_orkel> sorry Dave, wrong PR
[09:20:47] <_orkel> this is a correct one – https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1288
[09:20:57] <gibson042> for releases at least
[09:21:07] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah that one sounds good too orkel
[09:21:14] <gibson042> inter-release development can proceed as normal
[09:21:23] <_orkel> okey-dokey
[09:21:23] <DaveMethvin> do you want to land those three _orkel?
[09:21:28] <timmywil> gibson042: ah, yea, well if we tag Sizzle just before release, it will point to the same location
[09:21:32] <DaveMethvin> cool
[09:22:37] <timmywil> meaning commit 209823409whatever would also be the tag reference
[09:22:43] <m_gol> I think that at least if we plan to tag Sizzle & jQuery in the same time in some cases, it's better to start with Sizzle
[09:23:01] <timmywil> m_gol: I would agree with that
[09:23:06] <timmywil> we can automate it in teh build script
[09:23:18] <m_gol> it's not only about tagging in git but also (or even more) about changing the *-pre version to a stable one
[09:23:49] <timmywil> a little more involved, but could still be automated
[09:23:57] <m_gol> ;)
[09:24:30] <m_gol> timmywil, can you look into that? if it's too much work we can start with this approach in the next minor version
[09:24:37] <DaveMethvin> we could definitely use some cleanup to the build process ... after this patch release :)
[09:24:42] <m_gol> :)
[09:24:51] <timmywil> m_gol: we should do it manually this time
[09:24:53] <DaveMethvin> perhaps as part of the switch to AMD build
[09:24:54] <timmywil> yea
[09:25:00] <m_gol> I have 2 pull requests making use of .jshintignore amongst others ;)
[09:25:06] * timmywil adding ticket
[09:25:10] <m_gol> as for prs, this one looks safe & worth to pull: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1300
[09:25:53] <DaveMethvin> agreed m_gol
[09:26:13] <m_gol> any objections? :) If not, I'll pull it after the meeting
[09:26:18] <DaveMethvin> ga m_gol
[09:27:18] <m_gol> k, the rest prs can wait for after the release
[09:27:41] <DaveMethvin> so as far as the last item regarding 2.1/1.11, I thought it might be easier to start a discussion based on what we talked about in Portland
[09:27:58] <m_gol> yup
[09:28:01] <DaveMethvin> so i'll put together a doc from that and send around a link in a couple of days
[09:28:06] <DaveMethvin> then we can discuss next monday
[09:28:09] <m_gol> k
[09:28:24] <_orkel> sounds good
[09:28:24] <DaveMethvin> if people can't make the meeting they'll at least have the chance to have input via the doc
[09:28:51] <jaubourg> good idea
[09:28:59] <DaveMethvin> the new ticket queue looks empty so that's god
[09:29:05] <DaveMethvin> the one left, i'm not sure about
[09:29:21] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: oh regarding documenting node stuff...
[09:29:39] <timmywil> do we need another docs page perhaps?
[09:29:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think we may
[09:29:50] <DaveMethvin> that doesn't really fit anywhere else
[09:30:00] <timmywil> ok
[09:30:55] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14084 so it seems that the result for .width() on border-box is wrong?
[09:30:57] <m_gol> do we plan to publish today's version to npm?
[09:31:16] <DaveMethvin> m_gol good question i think rwaldron may have the keys to our npm
[09:31:32] <timmywil> that's on me
[09:31:34] <DaveMethvin> ideally it would be part of our release script
[09:31:39] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: the jsonp bug is a known limitation btw. You need browser sniffing a-la $.jsonp to handle it correctly
[09:31:53] <timmywil> OH, perfect time to bring up a ticket. let me find it
[09:32:14] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13768
[09:32:28] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/compare/13768
[09:32:38] <timmywil> I've gotten feedback from domenic and he gave it a +1
[09:32:42] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: can't confirm... http://jsfiddle.net/m_gol/kDVyv/
[09:32:44] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:32:48] <timmywil> does everyone like this solution?
[09:33:06] <timmywil> essentially, it means jQuery is required in node like this: var jQuery = require("jquery")(window);
[09:33:15] * jaubourg loves it
[09:33:17] <timmywil> where window is optional if available globally
[09:33:41] <timmywil> without a window that has a document, jQuery cannot be initialized
[09:33:46] <DaveMethvin> i was good with it ... although it might confuse people?
[09:34:06] <timmywil> executing jQuery will give them an error on what needs to happen
[09:34:21] <DaveMethvin> seems good then
[09:34:32] <DaveMethvin> i prefer that to globals
[09:35:05] <m_gol> timmywil +1, and I've seen this pattern before so it seems it's an established solution
[09:35:34] <DaveMethvin> m_gol i looked at it last night and convinced myself it was wrong but I agree, it looks right now
[09:35:34] <timmywil> cool
[09:36:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: should this land in the next version, or should we publish to NPM starting 1.11?
[09:36:14] <DaveMethvin> timmywil let's go with 1.11
[09:36:20] <DaveMethvin> oh actually 2.1
[09:36:26] <timmywil> sry, I meant 2.1
[09:36:27] <DaveMethvin> we won't publish 1.x to node
[09:36:32] <timmywil> yea
[09:36:38] <_orkel> timmywil: so we passing window object only for nodejs?
[09:36:53] <timmywil> _orkel: right
[09:37:06] <_orkel> okey
[09:38:01] <DaveMethvin> alrighty, any other issues?
[09:38:35] <m_gol> I don't know what to think about this .height() issue...
[09:38:49] <m_gol> I can't reproduce it on jsFiddle but I mostly just pasted code from the example on jsbin
[09:38:54] <jaubourg> you need to .growUp()?
[09:38:58] * jaubourg hides
[09:39:15] <DaveMethvin> i could use a few more pixels of height myself
[09:39:26] <_orkel> timmywil: but we don't need "undefined" argument – https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/intro.js#L14
[09:39:28] <_orkel> correct?
[09:39:46] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: nah, you're perfect... you just need more memes on yout Ts
[09:40:06] <m_gol> _orkel: it's to protect ourselves from others overwriting undefined
[09:40:09] <timmywil> _orkel: there are lots of little things like that we don't need
[09:40:13] <DaveMethvin> sohttp://jsbin.com/etuvom/1 that looks wrong tho
[09:40:16] <jaubourg> and I need to practice typing it seems
[09:40:25] <DaveMethvin> whoops http://jsbin.com/etuvom/1
[09:40:31] <_orkel> m_gol: as far as i know you can do that only in old IE
[09:40:51] <m_gol> _orkel: unfortunately that's not true :)
[09:40:59] * m_gol in ES5 this is illegal:
[09:41:05] <m_gol> undefined = 5;
[09:41:10] * m_gol but this is legal:
[09:41:14] <m_gol> var undefined = 5;
[09:41:15] <m_gol> :P
[09:41:32] <m_gol> you can't overwrite it but since it's not a reserved keyword, you can shadow it
[09:41:33] <timmywil> _orkel: I'm planning on more custom builds for npm in the future, but for now I think we shouldn't veer too far away from the master branch
[09:41:52] <m_gol> which makes all of this write protection completely useless
[09:42:10] <_orkel> m_gol: in what browsers you can do that?
[09:42:14] <DaveMethvin> once we get this patch release out and a few weeks pass, i think we can start on 2.1/1.11 in masters
[09:42:15] <m_gol> in every single one
[09:42:26] <DaveMethvin> if we need another patch we just branch, cherry pick, and tag
[09:42:36] <jaubourg> var undefined = true; would probably be the most confusing thing ever
[09:43:10] <m_gol> these few extra bytes are worth protecting us from bug reports from people with such issues :P
[09:43:38] <DaveMethvin> m_gol you mean, crazy people? :)
[09:43:46] <m_gol> jaubourg: var undefined = Math.random() < 0.99; :P
[09:43:50] <_orkel> m_gol:can you give me a jsfiddle example?
[09:43:57] <m_gol> _orkel: sure, a moment
[09:44:18] <timmywil> that's probably good for -dev, yea?
[09:44:24] <DaveMethvin> alrighty, i think our work here is done
[09:44:32] <jaubourg> m_gol: var undefined = Math.random() < 0.99 || ( function() {} )()
[09:44:55] <_orkel> jaubourg: :-)
[09:44:58] <DaveMethvin> let's move this to -dev and wrap up ... see you there!
