[08:34:37] <jzaefferer> Thanks JamesMGreene for the reminder
[08:34:43] <JamesMGreene> np
[08:34:54] <jzaefferer> Ping leobalter scott_gonzalez gibson042 arschmitz sfrisk
[08:34:57] <gibson042> here
[08:34:59] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[08:35:02] <arschmitz> hi
[08:35:04] <jzaefferer> hi arthurvr
[08:35:06] <JamesMGreene> QUnit meeting time
[08:35:14] <jzaefferer> Agenda/minutes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FbWhiFQ9gWQvB1Tm4QM_OC4me-ha2ujDWH5sdF7ueo/edit
[08:36:27] <jzaefferer> Not much going on with QUnit itself
[08:36:49] <jzaefferer> We fixed some stuff from 1.16 and landed the filter UI, so those fixes have to go into 1.17
[08:37:05] <jzaefferer> leobalter wanted to work on the last regression, but hasn't gotten to it, yet
[08:37:10] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene, can you help with that?
[08:37:20] <JamesMGreene> Which one?
[08:37:34] <jzaefferer> Here: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/716
[08:37:45] <sfrisk> allo!
[08:38:07] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, I think so
[08:38:28] <jzaefferer> Okay, just assign it to yourself when you work on it, probably also ping Leo
[08:38:49] <jzaefferer> I'll review PRs asap
[08:39:19] <JamesMGreene> Funny, we have a test that using that element and its `innerHTML` o_O
[08:39:20] <jzaefferer> I thinks that's all on QUnit
[08:39:43] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/efec52ce947fea2b7c0021375a63549639f115e7/test/reporter-html.js#L75-L86
[08:40:04] <jzaefferer> As for TestSwarm: I've updated the readme to indicate the kind-of abandoned project status
[08:41:28] <JamesMGreene> ...and we don't run that test page with Grunt :-o
[08:41:44] <jzaefferer> oh
[08:41:59] <jzaefferer> I can't remember ever running it manually either
[08:42:12] <JamesMGreene> nvm
[08:42:14] <JamesMGreene> I was wrong
[08:42:23] <JamesMGreene> It is included on the "index.html" page
[08:42:39] <jzaefferer> oh
[08:42:43] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[08:42:46] <JamesMGreene> anyway, I'll dig into it
[08:42:46] <jzaefferer> well
[08:42:48] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:42:49] <leobalter> sorry, late
[08:42:58] <jzaefferer> On browserstack-runner: The BrowserStack team is fixing bugs on their end. Its not quite ready, yet, but I think they're making good progress
[08:43:17] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: Do you have time for #716 (regression in HTML Reporter) or do you want me to grab it?
[08:43:34] <jzaefferer> Once they fixed them all, we can deploy the .travis.yml update for QUnit and Globalize and get cross-browser testing for every commit, including PRs
[08:44:02] <leobalter> I'm having some family issues and I can't tell if I'll be able to do this week.
[08:44:21] <JamesMGreene> Understood. I'll grab it
[08:44:46] <leobalter> it's probably better if you grab it and if I get some time I'll work on something else
[08:45:31] <jzaefferer> Sounds good
[08:45:43] <jzaefferer> Not the family issues part, though
[08:46:03] <JamesMGreene> Indeed
[08:46:24] <jzaefferer> Last on the agenda, CSS testing. arschmitz sfrisk, was there any response from Kristofer? Or should we not discuss that here anyway?
[08:46:37] <jzaefferer> Then I can stop pulling you into this meeting
[08:46:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: on which aspect
[08:46:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: kinda makes sense it is testing infrastructure
[08:47:12] <arschmitz> some of which could potentially be used on ui and mobile as well
[08:47:56] <jzaefferer> Well, last time we ended with: "Alex to ping Kristofer (Topcoat)"
[08:47:57] <sfrisk> We have been discussing perf testing in Chassis
[08:48:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: so are you refering to perf testing or like the unit testing or?
[08:48:13] <jzaefferer> I don't know, anything related to CSS Testing...
[08:48:26] <jzaefferer> if its useful for UI and Mobile as well, it makes sense to cover it here
[08:48:28] <arschmitz> ok well iv been talking with him about all of it anyway
[08:48:50] <arschmitz> and he had said last week his time had freed up dramaticly
[08:49:07] <arschmitz> and we made plans on how we were going to approach it and the next step
[08:49:29] <arschmitz> but now i have not heard from him sense and i have pinged him again
[08:49:50] <arschmitz> the perf testing applies to ui and mobile for sure
[08:49:51] <jzaefferer> okay, we can get back to this in 2 weeks then
[08:49:58] <arschmitz> we have had prs to add it to both already
[08:50:32] <arschmitz> but i think we should work it out on chassis and then move it to the other repos once we have it all figured out
[08:50:33] <jzaefferer> speaking of cross-project testing infrastructure: What happened to your site spider?
[08:50:48] <arschmitz> oh i re wrote it last weekend actually
[08:50:53] <arschmitz> with some input from scott_gonzalez
[08:51:09] <arschmitz> i speerateed out the core spider and am publishing that stand alone from the grunt module
[08:51:24] <arschmitz> because arthurvr wants to try it with gulp for html5bp
[08:51:43] <arthurvr> I indeed wanted to develop gulp version of this
[08:51:44] <arschmitz> cleaned up the test reporting a lot
[08:52:21] <jzaefferer> Sounds good
[08:52:31] <arschmitz> i need to fix one small thing then im going to publish it ( i got pulled away after you reviewed all my ui stuff )
[08:52:54] <jzaefferer> If we had actual documentation about our cross-organization collaboration, we could add that there...
[08:53:09] <arschmitz> we shoud make something
[08:53:17] <arschmitz> we are really starting to have more and more all the time
[08:53:46] <jzaefferer> I wrote a small esformatter plugin to format object literals on one line when short enough. My line length detection is crap though, so now I'm waiting for some input from Miller (author of esformatter)
[08:54:09] <jzaefferer> There's this sad list: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Collaboration
[08:54:44] <jzaefferer> Btw. has anyone here used eslint?
[08:55:11] <arthurvr> I did on some projects, why?
[08:55:13] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure what's going on with jshint, but was wondering if one day just one of those two would exist...
[08:55:52] <jzaefferer> well, looking at recent commits, jshint is still alive and kicking...
[08:56:20] <jzaefferer> eslint as well
[08:56:22] <arthurvr> indeed, still really active people in there
[08:57:01] <jzaefferer> where jshint uses its own parser, eslint uses an esprima fork called espree
[08:57:10] <jzaefferer> oh well, some other time...
[08:58:08] <jzaefferer> I think that's all, thanks everybody!
[08:58:47] <arthurvr> bye!
[08:59:33] <JamesMGreene> o/
[09:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers rxaviers_ tj_vantoll
[09:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault:
[09:01:32] <jzaefferer> weeeee
[09:01:32] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:38] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:01:41] <jperrault> o/
[09:01:43] <arthurvr> Hi!
[09:02:14] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> hey everyone
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> So, after another round of review and some small updates, the slider regression has been fixed.
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10721
[09:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Any updated on AMD for tests and demos?
[09:04:44] <jzaefferer> Btw. we have a nice drop on tickets (-9) and PRs (-5) this week
[09:04:44] <rxaviers> can I answer you soon? I'm in the middle of the CLDR meeting right now
[09:04:52] <rxaviers> It's late. Almost done
[09:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sure.
[09:05:00] <rxaviers> delayed*
[09:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully the PR count will drop even more this week.
[09:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a few long-lived PRs that are coming close to an end :-)
[09:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of which, arschmitz: is there anything to discuss regarding classes?
[09:06:53] <arschmitz> No i got really bogged down on some widget test failures and didnt finish updates yet
[09:07:05] <arschmitz> but i got those figured out so hopfully after the meeting ill finish
[09:07:40] <arschmitz> and button will be right after
[09:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:07:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: i dont recall anything from either review needing discussion?
[09:08:00] <arschmitz> do you
[09:08:05] <jzaefferer> I got some time tomorrow morning to review them
[09:08:11] <jzaefferer> or Friday afternoon
[09:08:27] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: we had some pointless discussion about the "object" argument name :p
[09:08:32] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome thanks sorry its taking longer i was about to ask you or scott to look at it this morning it was killing me
[09:08:43] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: oh i went with classes?
[09:08:52] <arschmitz> as a property on the settings object
[09:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> If this next push will essentially make classes "done", then I'll do a review after that push.
[09:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> So far I've only reviewed the review :-P
[09:09:04] <jzaefferer> "Bad name!" "Good name!" "Still think its bad!" "Well, I don't care, I already renamed it" /o\
[09:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't actually done a full review of the code.
[09:09:33] <jzaefferer> So much fun
[09:09:36] <arschmitz> lol
[09:09:42] <arschmitz> i hate thinking of variable names
[09:09:45] <arschmitz> im terrible at it
[09:09:48] <jzaefferer> Well, my last review was a full review, before I only glanced at the unit tests
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we'll hopefully have reviews done by the end of the week then.
[09:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> I've scheduled my review for tomorrow.
[09:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> And jzaefferer said either tomorrow morning or Friday afternoon.
[09:10:45] <arschmitz> ok ill make sure its ready
[09:10:53] <arschmitz> by tomorrow morning
[09:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll make sure to think of some completely new implementation by then :-P
[09:11:15] <arschmitz> Deal
[09:11:28] <arschmitz> you know i can drive to PA in like 8 hours right?
[09:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep my doors locked and blinds shut.
[09:11:53] <arschmitz> lol
[09:11:57] <arschmitz> i know where you live
[09:12:30] <jzaefferer> Scott is already used to explosions on his street, you can use that to your advantage
[09:12:38] <arschmitz> lol
[09:12:44] <arschmitz> this is true
[09:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> ;-)
[09:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to RTL.
[09:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's much to discuss here, unless people have names to give to me.
[09:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Did you discuss this at IBM? Not sure when the internal governance call was scheduled for.
[09:13:54] <arschmitz> no ill email ariya today if you want and see if i can get a more clear answer then i did via tweet
[09:14:27] <jperrault> I brought it up with Andy, but I thought there was going to be a call scheduled to discuss...did I get that wrong?
[09:14:51] <jperrault> I have a call scheduled later today with one of our DE's to discuss.
[09:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm going to schedule a call, but I was waiting to see if there were others that should be invited.
[09:15:47] <jperrault> I should have a name for you after my meeting.
[09:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:16:07] <jzaefferer> I'll ask around a bit as well
[09:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> And arschmitz is in contact with Ariya, but I don't think he has the contact info for the Ariya's person yet.
[09:16:26] <arschmitz> thats correct
[09:17:05] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: there is also one person we could try to contact though previously todd has tried with out luck
[09:17:17] <arschmitz> that did a full rtl implementation of mobile back at 1.0
[09:17:25] <arschmitz> and has updated as recently as 1.4.3
[09:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> I've got that info. I'll try to contact that person as well.
[09:18:03] <arschmitz> cool
[09:18:06] <arschmitz> because i cant
[09:18:10] <arschmitz> i dont have a facebook lol
[09:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: You were supposed to close http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10743 with an explanation.
[09:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> Can you do that today?
[09:19:07] <arschmitz> oh shoot sorry ill do it right now
[09:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't get to tooltips in native dialogs yet, but I have it on my list for tomorrow.
[09:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer rxaviers: Anything that we need to discuss about the new theme?
[09:21:20] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, no updated on AMD test/demo
[09:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'd like to just remove that item from our weekly meetings.
[09:21:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'll add the variables back to the box-shadow definition, as Jasper suggested
[09:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's been dragging on and it's not essential in any way.
[09:22:30] <jzaefferer> rxaviers said that that should work fine, we'll still have to actually test it
[09:22:40] <jzaefferer> renaming the variables would cause various problems
[09:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: What's up with the minified files?
[09:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want someone else to look into this or do you have time to get it done?
[09:23:52] <tj_vantoll> I'm swamped lately so I don't have time for anything other than some light triage unfortunately.
[09:24:28] <tj_vantoll> If someone else wants to take a look feel free. rxaviers summarized the latest in the ticket.
[09:24:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> I might work on that since I need to do some AMD work with PEP.
[09:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you want to discuss menu styling?
[09:26:29] <jzaefferer> Yes
[09:26:45] <jzaefferer> Well, mostly get everyone to agree to the proposal to use ui-state-active for menu everywhere
[09:26:46] <jzaefferer> brb
[09:27:49] <jzaefferer> So instead of mixing ui-state-focus and ui-state-active, we'd only use ui-state-active
[09:28:03] <jzaefferer> Makes sense semantically and looks better, even more so with the updated theme
[09:28:32] <arschmitz> +1
[09:29:30] <tj_vantoll> I think it makes sense.
[09:29:55] <jzaefferer> Okay, I'll work on that next week
[09:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:31:02] <arschmitz> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10743 will be closed as soon as trac responds so should be done by tomorrow
[09:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's already closed :-)
[09:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes the reloading just takes forever.
[09:32:17] <arschmitz> lol
[09:32:37] <arthurvr> Working with trac means some things take forever.. ;)
[09:32:50] <arschmitz> lol
[09:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes Trac requests take almost as long as it's going to take for me to finish DEBT :-P
[09:33:16] <arschmitz> ha ha ha
[09:33:28] <arthurvr> lol :-)
[09:33:37] <arschmitz> maybe if i actually did more then 1 commit a year it woud help?
[09:33:57] <arschmitz> im still your ONLY contributor though lol
[09:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> Certainly. More commits would be great :-P
[09:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, sounds like we've got nothing else.
[09:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
[09:34:36] <arthurvr> bye!
[10:00:59] <arthurvr> agcolom: kswedberg: danheberden: RedWolves: gnarf: meeting time!
[10:01:07] <kswedberg> hello
[10:01:13] <arthurvr> who else am I forgetting?
[10:01:17] <gnarf> howdy
[10:01:27] <agcolom> hi!
[10:01:28] <gnarf> brb tho
[10:01:44] <agcolom> Aurelio, but I don't know his handle...
[10:02:02] <arthurvr> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJhQj3Nn-5rdmqocN9NKP8CpnC4Z42TRAvNC3SJLj3o/edit#gid=0
[10:02:04] <arthurvr> don’t know too
[10:03:32] <arthurvr> Okay let’s start, glad we’re all together today
[10:05:11] <gnarf> back now
[10:06:01] <gnarf> adding shit to bottom of agenda
[10:06:11] <gnarf> but we should probably get started with the Learn site stuff
[10:06:20] <arthurvr> yes, much to discuss
[10:07:03] <RWhitbec_> I'm here
[10:07:29] <RWhitbec_> new computer haven't set up ZNC yet so I get the funky nick for now
[10:07:32] <danheberden> sry, ran into an issue purchasing the jsconf ticket
[10:07:35] <danheberden> silly amex
[10:07:46] <gnarf> it was jsconf launch time :)
[10:07:47] <danheberden> ooh, looks super 1337 RWhitbec_
[10:08:02] <RWhitbec_> That's how I roll
[10:08:02] <agcolom> oh, sorry!
[10:08:18] <arthurvr> hi AurelioDeRosa
[10:08:22] <agcolom> Hey AurelioDeRosa!
[10:08:27] <gnarf> agcolom: where should we track attendance on this sheet?
[10:08:37] <gnarf> and should we maybe switch to a document instead of a sheet?
[10:08:39] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone. I'm a bit late, but here I am.
[10:08:39] <agcolom> I'll add a linke
[10:09:19] <danheberden> agcolom: to the doc, ya?
[10:09:34] <RWhitbec_> AureliaDeRosa you didn't miss anything
[10:09:37] <agcolom> yes
[10:09:56] <gnarf> AurelioDeRosa: no worries you can check the logs on irc.jquery.org but you didn't miss anything other than us talking about the agenda and saying "learn site" because thats the first item
[10:10:01] <gnarf> im reading over this doc linked tho
[10:10:13] <gnarf> I think the plan sounds solid
[10:10:22] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you for the sum up
[10:10:37] <arthurvr> I agree on everything in the doc
[10:10:41] <kswedberg> so for the "tutorials" on the learn site, is the proposal to have them be interactive?
[10:10:53] <agcolom> kswedberg: I would love that!
[10:10:59] <arthurvr> oh yeah
[10:11:01] <arthurvr> +1
[10:11:13] <gnarf> kswedberg: agcolom: unrealistic i think at first, unless someone really wants to spearhead that
[10:11:23] <kswedberg> agcolom: I would, too. I'm wondering how feasible that is in short term
[10:11:24] <gnarf> i'd prolly put the "interactive tutorials" on a lower priority
[10:11:28] <kswedberg> heh. gnarf
[10:11:30] <agcolom> yes,
[10:11:37] <arthurvr> Agreed on that
[10:11:38] <danheberden> yeah, it sounds fantastic
[10:11:51] <gnarf> I really think collecting the videos from all the jQuery confs and putting them in a curated thing on learn makes sense too
[10:11:52] <agcolom> I have written a proposal for a sabbatical at work to do exactly that
[10:12:02] <danheberden> but keeping up on all 9001 of arthurvr's PRs will take all of that time :p
[10:12:04] <agcolom> but I will hear in Feb to start in Jan 2016
[10:12:13] <kswedberg> so, if they aren't interactive, is there a clear distinction between articles and tutorials?
[10:12:16] <RWhitbec_> @gnarf I started working on that
[10:12:24] <arthurvr> danheberden: lol
[10:12:30] <agcolom> A tutorial shows you how to do something
[10:12:49] <gnarf> RWhitbec_: cool, running into any problems/progress yet? do we have an issue to track progress setup yet?
[10:12:51] <RWhitbec_> an articel shows you how smart I am
[10:12:59] <RWhitbec_> there is an issue.
[10:12:59] <agcolom> an article can be a discussion about a new feature for example or best practice
[10:13:03] <gnarf> cheers
[10:13:33] <RWhitbec_> gnarf https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/561
[10:13:33] <danheberden> Are we all on the same page about the desire to further the learn site?
[10:13:40] <kswedberg> agcolom: ok, but I think the line is going to blur pretty quickly.
[10:14:03] <gnarf> I think most of us here think learn is good in theory, but short on time
[10:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> The concept is definitely good.
[10:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's definitely lacking in some areas though.
[10:14:42] <agcolom> kswedberg: yes, it can but blurry. but say a getting started with jQuery Mobile and a step by step guide to getting your first page done... that's a tutorial
[10:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> And in my opinion, it contains some bad information.
[10:15:07] <RWhitbec_> I had a thought about learn I'd like to propose, I think we should expand scope of the learn to be more then just jquery and have it match our mission and vision of the foundation.
[10:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> Would you say a tutorial walks you through some process step by step and an article just explains a concept or set of APIs?
[10:15:32] <danheberden> is the learn site the best vehicle for that?
[10:15:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: perfect!
[10:16:02] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think there is some "bad info" too but we need to like identify it
[10:16:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i would say a tutorial is a step by step walk through 100%
[10:16:23] <kswedberg> k. that clarifies. thanks, scott_gonzalez
[10:16:43] <arthurvr> Personally I think this all isn’t as a fix for not having a maintainer tho - which was our biggest problem lately IMHO
[10:16:48] <arthurvr> but it for sure might help
[10:17:04] <gnarf> i think the most important thing
[10:17:25] <gnarf> is finding someone who has the time and wants to actually facilitate landing these things and making them happen and organizing it all :)
[10:17:37] <danheberden> i think having someone with this as their focus is essential to being successful
[10:17:44] <danheberden> without a curator
[10:17:52] <danheberden> it'll get into the same disarray
[10:18:00] <RWhitbec_> I've been working on landing things as I have time. 2-3 times per week
[10:18:08] <arthurvr> 200% agreed
[10:18:21] <arthurvr> thanks RWhitbec_ for that
[10:18:49] <agcolom> I think once we know what we're aiming for, then we can work towards our goal with the resources we have. Once we know what we want and what we have to achieve this, we can prioritise and have a plan.
[10:18:58] <RWhitbec_> for every PR I land arthurvr opens 3 more :P
[10:19:06] <arthurvr> Haha
[10:19:07] <gnarf> RWhitbec_: and I occasionally jump over to hit a merge or two also, but our commit style guides and clas and all that jazz make maintaining more of a task than "yeah this looks good" << I can offer that opinion a lot more often if someone else is bringing them home
[10:19:10] <arthurvr> So you don’t get bored :-)
[10:19:47] <arthurvr> Also agreed on that. I’d love to help once I can btw
[10:20:40] <danheberden> definitely
[10:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be working on the automated CLA checks, so that should get easier.
[10:20:52] <AurelioDeRosa> I have a bit of spare time lately, so if there is anything that needs to be written, I can help with that.
[10:20:53] <arthurvr> For sure
[10:21:03] <RWhitbec_> I think what would be great as an outcome of the content team is a roadmap to follow as a lander.  Right now the easy PR's are obvious problems but new content PR or content that is outdated would need some input from content team IMO
[10:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I think it's ok for learn.jquery.com to have more lax commit style guide if you want.
[10:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's really just the refs that matter.
[10:21:31] <danheberden> +1
[10:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you ever plan on producing a changelog.
[10:21:41] <gnarf> um
[10:21:42] <gnarf> no
[10:21:45] <gnarf> so
[10:21:48] <arthurvr> +1, why would we need a changelog?
[10:22:00] <gnarf> i think we can all vote on that and then it just becomes making sure the closes or fixes or ref's are right
[10:22:00] <agcolom> I've added a ok to land label and a needs CLA label which could be handy
[10:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> Writing the component has always been awkward for that repo anyway.
[10:22:24] <arthurvr> Yeah - just to make sure everybody uses them :)
[10:22:31] <RWhitbec_> BTW I was hoping to get feedback on this Issue/PR over at jquery-wp-content https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/338
[10:22:42] <gnarf> can we can do that for all of the content repos?
[10:22:44] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'll be automating the CLA check, which will manage the label for you :-)
[10:22:55] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Thank you!
[10:23:09] <arthurvr> awesome, scott_gonzalez !
[10:23:12] <danheberden> moar like awesomeizing
[10:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do what? Relax the commit message style guide requirements?
[10:23:29] <gnarf> yeah
[10:23:32] <arschmitz> gnarf: there are components for the api if you are considering those content?
[10:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[10:23:47] <gnarf> api is like half-content-half-code
[10:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> API sites are pretty structured, so they're easy to follow.
[10:24:12] <gnarf> basically non wp-conent, non api sites can just have normal messages and "component" isn't important
[10:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> But in general, the content sites can be pretty lax.
[10:24:43] <gnarf> if it has .com .org or .net in the repo name
[10:24:57] <danheberden> as long as common sense is used, it should be fine for content sites - agreed
[10:25:08] <gnarf> thats a decision then! :)
[10:25:18] <arthurvr> o/
[10:25:43] <gnarf> "Agreed to relax commit message style guides for content site repos (.com/.net/.org repos)"
[10:26:21] <RWhitbec_> Do we communicate that on contribute?
[10:26:31] <RWhitbec_> or do we just let it slide when we land?
[10:26:35] <danheberden> @gnarf but not for /^api/ repos, yes?
[10:27:02] <danheberden> RWhitbec_: should be on contrib of what process can be omittted
[10:27:08] <gnarf> i think we will end up following pretty closely
[10:27:15] <gnarf> even "relaxed"
[10:27:26] <gnarf> a lot of us are just in the mode to make those style commits all the time
[10:27:39] <gnarf> but for api contributions - it's prolly good to keep the "component: message" style
[10:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'd like API sites to follow the guidelines.
[10:28:23] <arschmitz> i would like to see api use the current format
[10:28:30] <agcolom> +1
[10:28:32] <arthurvr> For sure. Pretty easy to specify components in there
[10:28:53] <agcolom> it's in the notes
[10:29:05] <danheberden> for learn, the "component" could just be article, tutorial, content-update, fix
[10:29:54] <gnarf> maybe we should wait until we find a reason to "relax" and then quantify what it is we need
[10:30:07] <gnarf> but we do want to make it a little easier to maintain/land content
[10:30:18] <agcolom> ok
[10:30:32] <gnarf> so one of the proposals here was basically an analysis of the current content
[10:30:36] <gnarf> which i think is really needed
[10:30:49] <gnarf> but requires a lot of reading / hunting
[10:31:02] <arthurvr> that’s true, but at the end it’s needed
[10:31:02] <gnarf> perhaps we could dump ourselves a list of all the URL's into a spreadsheet and start?
[10:31:07] <gnarf> and share
[10:31:13] <agcolom> +1
[10:31:15] <arthurvr> I can work on that if you want
[10:31:20] <danheberden> any creative way we can get help on that?
[10:31:32] <danheberden> like, would time into trying to campaign for reviewers
[10:31:35] <gnarf> aim for getting at least 2 peoples to read the article and rates it?
[10:31:38] <gnarf> wait a sec
[10:31:51] <arthurvr> tweeting it? :-)
[10:31:53] <gnarf> should we add some sort of ratings tracking? there has to be some service that would do that for us
[10:32:05] <arthurvr> or having a note on the frontpage
[10:32:12] <danheberden> i could see about getting BV to donate
[10:32:28] <arthurvr> what’s BV?
[10:32:39] <danheberden> Bazaarvoice is the company i work for- we make ratings and review software
[10:32:42] <gnarf> and / or I think I could convince a few people to read articles for correctness / ease of understanding as a newbie
[10:32:43] <arthurvr> oh
[10:33:23] <danheberden> content gets moderated, too, which is a perk
[10:33:58] <gnarf> danheberden: i'd be interested in seeing how we could rate our own learn content
[10:34:00] <gnarf> with it
[10:34:08] <gnarf> and/or let the community rate it over time
[10:34:25] <gnarf> would probably give us a good measure of effectiveness too
[10:34:34] <arthurvr> Hey, I just joined the jQuery github org :-)
[10:34:37] <gnarf> we could combine some of that with reports on like views, etc
[10:34:40] <danheberden> yeah, we could include additional questions to survey people's thoughts
[10:34:54] <danheberden> arthurvr: :)
[10:35:04] <agcolom> Did you find this article useful 1-5
[10:35:12] <danheberden> agcolom: exactly
[10:35:18] <arthurvr> Yeah but is that going to be correct?
[10:35:36] <danheberden> we're dealing with humans, so it's all a guestimate
[10:35:46] <danheberden> but it would help us gauge where to spend energy
[10:35:51] <gnarf> "correct" is never stated for an opinion/statistics question :)
[10:36:02] <arthurvr> I mean if we’re writing about deprecated features, but nobody knows they’re deprecated, reviews are going to be still good
[10:36:08] <gnarf> sure
[10:36:13] <arthurvr> People will just believe everything we write is correct
[10:36:16] <gnarf> we also need a "review for correctness"
[10:36:24] <gnarf> by "experts"
[10:36:26] <danheberden> but if deprecated features are super relevant to people
[10:36:27] <gnarf> on some other channel
[10:36:29] <danheberden> that's interesting to know
[10:36:31] <kswedberg> The "did you find it useful" type questions, I think, are only helpful if we know who the audience is.
[10:36:49] <gnarf> kswedberg: i think they also give us a bit of insight into who the audience is
[10:36:53] <danheberden> you know, in case selector performance makes a big come-back
[10:37:07] <kswedberg> but you don't know *why* it isn't found useful.
[10:37:18] <agcolom> that could be another question
[10:37:23] <arthurvr> we in fact need issues like this about every article: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/38
[10:37:25] <danheberden> ping brianarn
[10:37:30] <kswedberg> I might not find an article personally useful if it's too beginner-y, but a beginner might find it very useful.
[10:37:37] <arthurvr> yup
[10:37:37] <gnarf> kswedberg: well, i'm on the opinion that if it's "found" but "not found useful" thats a good question to be asking :)
[10:38:02] <gnarf> hrm
[10:38:14] <danheberden> yay!
[10:38:24] <gnarf> so user feedback
[10:38:30] <agcolom> if it's not a 4/5 we could ask why and what was missing but then we'd have to find a way to track these answers as well...
[10:38:32] <danheberden> Brian, we're talking about adding BV to the learn site
[10:38:34] <gnarf> maybe we should ask them to rate themselves on the same scale we rate articles
[10:38:43] <danheberden> and getting feedback on articles
[10:38:47] <brianarn> interesting idea
[10:38:48] <gnarf> then like 1<->5 rate uesfulness
[10:39:13] <danheberden> here: brianarn is someone who would be incredibly amazing at helping us out with any of the things we want to do
[10:39:26] <gnarf> and a old school contrib to learn already! :)
[10:39:33] <danheberden> exactly :)
[10:39:34] <kswedberg> gnarf. that's what I'm thinking. 1–5 my expertise on this subject and 1–5 article's usefuleness
[10:39:53] <gnarf> i think user generated feedback would be huge
[10:40:09] <arthurvr> an article might be useful but not well written
[10:40:11] <danheberden> bestbuy does something like that. "rate this camera. what level of photographer are you? (novice...expert)
[10:40:13] <danheberden> "
[10:40:26] <gnarf> but i think we still need the internal "review" by "experts" arthurvr - did you want to take that action item to start us a spreadsheet/system to do that?
[10:40:27] <kswedberg> danheberden: yes! that's what I'm getting at
[10:41:16] <gnarf> i also really like the idea of tracking the "version numbers" or "datedness" of those things and having to recheck the articles occasionally in the long term
[10:41:53] <arthurvr> gnarf: I’ll create a spreadsheet till next week, just a list of ever article (split up in the different sections)?
[10:42:19] <arthurvr> Then we could fill in our names next to the articles we want to review
[10:42:26] <agcolom> arthurvr: yes, I see a matrix really
[10:42:51] <gnarf> i think we could just each take a "column" -- and add #'s in our column for our "grade"
[10:42:53] <danheberden> could we tag the articles in the script header?
[10:42:58] <gnarf> so mutliples could help
[10:43:21] <danheberden> like, have areas we want to focus on or work towards
[10:43:22] <gnarf> i mean i wouldn't mind seeing two or three people read each just to make sure it's recent info
[10:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> Tag them with what?
[10:44:14] <agcolom> Like I can comment on how easy it is to read/understand but not on correctness and whether the appraoch presented is best practice
[10:44:18] <danheberden> subject matter? i shouldnt' propose a solution i should speak to the problem: how do we know the articles we are reviewing are what we want to be working on?
[10:44:23] <gnarf> and i think we could email the dev team for a little bit of a "crunch" on it if we had a nice spreadsheet so each person could take 2 or 3 articles and we could build up everything reviewed
[10:44:31] <danheberden> maybe if we started from that perspective, it would help?
[10:44:45] <danheberden> basically, some way to frame our review of these docs
[10:44:50] <danheberden> besides in isolation of each article
[10:46:01] <gnarf> agcolom: maybe separate out "tech review" and "language review" ?
[10:46:14] <arthurvr> Good idea.
[10:46:19] <agcolom> could be 2 separate columns
[10:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> Does the existing heirarchy make that easy or is there a lot of cross-subject-matter content?
[10:46:36] <arschmitz> I know there are not many mobile article's but im willing to read any for that thats needs reading for "tech review" im probably not the person for language review
[10:46:43] <danheberden> would adding these to the trello board be useful?
[10:47:04] <danheberden> we could make a review board so that we know if a story is being language reviewed or tech reviewed
[10:48:54] <gnarf> danheberden: i kinda think we could do that in a google sheet more efficiently but trello might be useful for it
[10:49:07] <arthurvr> I’m +1 for google sheet
[10:49:18] <gnarf> also - i don't care where we do it, so long as we do it :)
[10:49:19] <arschmitz> a simple google sheet seems easier
[10:49:32] <danheberden> whatever is easiest - sounds like google is more comfy for er'body
[10:49:52] <danheberden> so arthurvr you're going to make said sheet?
[10:49:56] <gnarf> so we want a "language review" and a "tech review" of each article on learn
[10:49:57] <danheberden> and get us ready to start review?
[10:50:06] <arthurvr> for sure
[10:50:06] <gnarf> do we want to also add a "newbie review" ?
[10:50:13] <danheberden> haha
[10:50:24] <danheberden> you mean for when i review it, gnarf ?
[10:50:47] <gnarf> i mean, i'd kind of like someone who's still actually learning JS/jquery to read some of them and offer a review
[10:51:00] <arthurvr> yes
[10:51:28] <gnarf> okay so
[10:51:32] <gnarf> things that don't pass the review
[10:51:51] <danheberden> also is this just 'review' or are we rating these ourselves?
[10:51:57] <brianarn> +1 to the idea of newbie review, feels like an area that most tech docs really mess up (not specifically jQuery, speaking in general)
[10:51:58] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6xhKoSBtoK9Nsc7uqBcVQULqflc7xWZbtsTO7p1fqA/edit?usp=sharing
[10:51:58] <danheberden> are we calling out each problem/issue?
[10:52:11] <danheberden> are we making an issue for each item?
[10:52:31] <arthurvr> agcolom: looks great
[10:52:33] <gnarf> danheberden: i think if you find an issue, you create a github issue article: tech review and list points
[10:52:39] <arthurvr> agcolom: I’ll fill it in this week
[10:52:45] <danheberden> gnarf,, sgtm
[10:52:46] <agcolom> arthurvr: thanks!
[10:52:54] <arthurvr> gnarf: sgtm
[10:53:24] <gnarf> i think if you feel its low quality you create a "article: feels low quality for us, remove it or rewrite it" kinda issue
[10:53:35] <danheberden> fantastic stuff - it feels good to have some focus on the learn site
[10:53:45] <arthurvr> yes it does
[10:53:52] <danheberden> and add the issue number to the doc
[10:54:22] <danheberden> i think it'd be useful to limit how many of these issues we make
[10:54:27] <danheberden> until we stop and work on some of them
[10:54:56] <danheberden> lest we end up using all of our energy making issues and none of it on fixing them
[10:55:05] <arthurvr> also really good point
[10:55:24] <danheberden> and how can we involve more than us?
[10:55:33] <danheberden> e.g., how can RWhitbec_ incite people to help us?
[10:55:54] <RWhitbec_> I can work on that
[10:56:08] <arthurvr> RWhitbec_: thanks!
[10:56:21] <RWhitbec_> it'd be good to have a roadmap and something to say look this is what we're working towards
[10:57:01] <danheberden> perhaps we can temper that proposal with our discussion here today
[10:57:08] <danheberden> and use that as a roadmap moving forward
[10:57:13] <AurelioDeRosa> I think the best way to let people know the project is need for a help is via Twitter.
[10:57:16] <RWhitbec_> +1
[10:57:24] <AurelioDeRosa> And maybe a blog post on that on the website
[10:57:37] <arthurvr> On the frontpage of learn.jquery.com maybe?
[10:57:44] <arthurvr> A ”we need your help” section?
[10:58:05] <danheberden> AurelioDeRosa: perhaps you could brainstorm some ways we could communicate our ongoing needs
[10:58:27] <danheberden> this problem affects a lot more than just the content team
[10:58:51] <AurelioDeRosa> arthurvr: that would help too
[10:58:51] <sfrisk> I totally spaced and forgot the jQuery Content meeting was at 1.  I'll participate better next time, guys!
[10:58:59] <danheberden> ok all, i have to run to another meeting; i really appreciate you making time for this today
[10:59:14] <arthurvr> bye! glad we were all together!
[10:59:22] <arthurvr> who puts up the minutes?
[10:59:27] <agcolom> me
[10:59:34] <arthurvr> thanks agcolom
[10:59:49] <AurelioDeRosa> danheberden: Yes, I can. Ok for everyone?
[11:01:02] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: yes, perfecr
[11:01:06] <agcolom> perfect
[11:01:10] <agcolom> thansk
[11:01:22] * agcolom cannot type anymore!
[11:01:31] <gnarf> sfrisk: no problem! we can remember to ping you next time if you want cc arthurvr :)
[11:01:43] <agcolom> sfrisk: hi, great to see you :-)
[11:01:46] <gnarf> so +2 weeks right?
[11:01:48] <arthurvr> for sure, We’ll not forget you next time
[11:01:52] <arthurvr> gnarf: yup
[11:01:57] <agcolom> yup
[11:02:01] <RWhitbec_> gnarf that's my understanding
[11:02:02] <sfrisk> awesome, thanks!
[11:02:07] <arthurvr> see y’all in #jquery-content
[11:02:23] <gnarf> aye, closing meeting room - move any leftovers to -content plz
