[11:01:49] <arschmitz> hi
[11:02:06] <gseguin> yes sir
[11:02:33] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:02:59] <agcolom> Hi
[11:04:08] <uGoMobi> someone added classic theme as topic to the agenda
[11:04:31] <arschmitz> that was me
[11:04:41] <uGoMobi> answer is that it's only a demo
[11:04:46] <_|Nix|_> Hey, sorry, all! I'm here!
[11:04:51] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/theme-classic/theme-classic.css
[11:04:51] * _|Nix|_ waves emphatically
[11:05:00] <uGoMobi> the warning is in the CSS
[11:05:21] <uGoMobi> won't harm if we also add that to the demo page itself
[11:05:47] <arschmitz> yeah no one is ever going to look there
[11:06:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually the demo is all about that CSS file
[11:06:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: most people are just going to copy the whole hting
[11:06:41] <uGoMobi> right
[11:06:46] <arschmitz> and never read a single line
[11:07:08] <arschmitz> also if we are mainting it as a demo not a one time download we are essentially supporting it
[11:07:31] <uGoMobi> same as datapicker demo
[11:07:37] <uGoMobi> datepicker*
[11:07:39] <arschmitz> yup
[11:08:01] <uGoMobi> but it was mostly added for convenience
[11:08:07] <uGoMobi> I don't mind if we remove it in 1.5 demos
[11:08:22] <arschmitz> ok so what about this issue with popup arrow
[11:08:34] <arschmitz> ( which didnt even exist in 1.3 in the lib )
[11:09:04] <uGoMobi> it's not a problem if that breaks when used with the classic theme
[11:09:29] <_|Nix|_> I was thinking maybe we should add the arrow background as an extension.
[11:09:31] <uGoMobi> but people might use gradients of their won
[11:09:35] <_|Nix|_> Although that may be too much trouble.
[11:09:37] <uGoMobi> s/won/own
[11:09:41] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, exactly.
[11:09:47] <_|Nix|_> That's a bit of a problem.
[11:09:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not worth it
[11:09:56] <uGoMobi> so it's more a general question
[11:10:06] <_|Nix|_> ... and all because of Android 4.1 and 4.2
[11:10:13] <arschmitz> i think its a demo so we dont need to worry about peoples custom css
[11:10:19] <uGoMobi> which we don't officially support
[11:10:24] <arschmitz> only what happens if you just take it and drop it in
[11:10:24] <_|Nix|_> That's true.
[11:10:29] <uGoMobi> because core doesn't support them
[11:10:45] <arschmitz> core supports 4.x?
[11:10:54] <uGoMobi> errrrr
[11:10:56] <uGoMobi> sorry
[11:11:01] <uGoMobi> please ignore
[11:11:09] <uGoMobi> I am ready 2.1 and 2.2
[11:11:33] <uGoMobi> is the fact that I didn't eat dinner yet a good excuse? ;-)
[11:11:37] <arschmitz> ok so lets go ahead and land this then
[11:11:55] <uGoMobi> s/ready/reading/
[11:12:13] <uGoMobi> I can't read and type anymore today, sorry
[11:12:19] <uGoMobi> ok let's land it
[11:12:24] <uGoMobi> add note in the docs?
[11:13:15] <arschmitz> sure
[11:13:32] <uGoMobi> just a note in general, not about the classic theme specific
[11:14:08] <uGoMobi> a lot of PRs landed today
[11:14:09] <uGoMobi> nice!
[11:14:20] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and they're still landing ...
[11:14:26] <uGoMobi> lots of bug fixes for 1.4.1
[11:14:47] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:15:14] <gseguin> are we going to try releasing 1.4.1 before San Diego?
[11:15:44] <uGoMobi> shall we make a 1.4.2 milestone for issues/PRs with lower priority?
[11:16:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think almost all PR's have the thumbs up at this point
[11:16:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: even better :)
[11:16:21] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[11:16:29] <arschmitz> so other then a few from non team members or 1.5 ones i think all should be pretty much good to go by then
[11:16:48] <gseguin> good
[11:16:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then we use 1.4.2 milestone for tickets
[11:17:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[11:17:03] <_|Nix|_> Sounds good.
[11:17:03] <uGoMobi> I suggest we release tomorrow
[11:17:17] <_|Nix|_> Didn't we have something against Friday releases?
[11:17:25] <arschmitz> yeah bad for PR
[11:17:36] <uGoMobi> yes true
[11:17:43] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, let's do it on Monday.
[11:17:56] <arschmitz> that gives a little more time to get stuff landed too
[11:18:07] <arschmitz> i have a bunch of contirubter prs that i need to rebase and land
[11:18:30] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:18:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i pinged you on one too if you have time
[11:18:46] <uGoMobi> I'll make a draft for the blog post
[11:18:54] <uGoMobi> and a PR for website changes
[11:19:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Did you URL me too?
[11:19:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Let's talk about it after the meeting.
[11:19:29] <arschmitz> no i just mentioned you in comment
[11:19:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[11:19:38] <arschmitz> yeah ill give you link then
[11:19:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there were some open PRs for the docs too, right?
[11:20:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you give them the :+1: I can also land them.
[11:20:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean the third-party PRs.
[11:21:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok ill do that and assign you if i want you to get any more
[11:21:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ : can you take a look at the open PRs for the docs and website as well
[11:21:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i aalready am
[11:21:35] <uGoMobi> so we can land everything before we tag
[11:21:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, thank
[11:21:43] <uGoMobi> thanks*
[11:21:54] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&labels=Demos%2CComponent%3A+Build&milestone=26&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:22:06] <uGoMobi> we still have some demo issues
[11:22:15] <uGoMobi> actually it are more build issues
[11:23:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they can be manually fixed in demos as a stop gap if we want
[11:23:54] <uGoMobi> I think we can close https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/issues/4 as duplicate because I think it should be fixed in  jquery-mobile
[11:24:04] <arschmitz> but all should be fixed in build
[11:24:18] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, sorry there were
[11:24:34] <uGoMobi> yeah but I don't like to release the zip with jQuery core in it
[11:24:43] <uGoMobi> without*
[11:24:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: arschmitz is reviewing them now
[11:25:06] <agcolom> brilliant!
[11:25:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as far as https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/issues/4 it needs to be fixed in both places
[11:25:29] <arschmitz> the 1.4 need to be fixed
[11:25:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, we can leave that open for 1.4.0 demos
[11:25:47] <arschmitz> and then jquery-mobile needs to so it will be fixed going forward
[11:25:56] <uGoMobi> I forgot we can replaces them now
[11:26:03] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:26:28] <agcolom> I've made progress with the removal of iframes. But we need to change things in jquery-wp-content so I will do some testing locally and I hope that we will be able to decide how to best do this while in San Diego
[11:26:29] <arschmitz> yeah we can actually fix demos now its great
[11:26:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: good idea
[11:26:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok sounds good
[11:27:06] <agcolom> will be a lot easier to discuss this face to face ;-)
[11:27:18] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:27:22] <uGoMobi> no more typing :D
[11:28:13] <arschmitz> we have to have set a record for landing PR's today already
[11:28:30] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[11:28:50] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:29:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: May I land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6977 after I fix the line length issues?
[11:29:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: do you have time to give those demos/build issues a look?
[11:29:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just gave the thumbs up
[11:30:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! Thanks!
[11:30:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I can look at it today
[11:30:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: great, thanks
[11:30:30] <gseguin> which issue is it?
[11:30:45] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss?
[11:31:31] <uGoMobi> looks like we are done here
[11:31:34] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:31:38] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
