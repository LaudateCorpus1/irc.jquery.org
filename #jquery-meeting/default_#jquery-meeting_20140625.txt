[09:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: arschmitz gnarf kborchers mikesherov petersendidit
[09:00:57] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:15] <kborchers> howdy
[09:01:15] <tj_vantoll> I just missed the name call :)
[09:01:26] <petersendidit> hey
[09:02:20] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't seen jzaefferer today.
[09:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> And rxaviers is on vacation starting today.
[09:03:30] <jzaefferer> oh hai
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> The Bower issue with limiting jQuery versions has been fixed.
[09:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> And all externals are now managed via Bower.
[09:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll Anything to discuss for datepicker or selectmenu?
[09:05:13] <mikesherov_> Awesome
[09:05:44] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer and I worked with fnagel to work through documenting the remaining options.
[09:06:15] <tj_vantoll> fnagel has the calendar/datepicker split mostly complete. He's working on cleaning up the demos and tests at the moment.
[09:07:06] <tj_vantoll> I asked to work on finalizing the open PR so we can merge it into the main datepicker branch.
[09:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> That datepicker/calendar PR looks like it needs to be rebased.
[09:07:18] <tj_vantoll> Once that happens I'd like to get back working on it as well.
[09:07:23] <tj_vantoll> Indeed
[09:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> It contains a lot of commits that are from master.
[09:07:30] <jzaefferer> Where "documenting" mostly meant deciding whether to keep or drop an option. When dropping, what the alternative can be.
[09:07:48] <tj_vantoll> We discussed starting an upgrade guide for datepicker early, like now.
[09:08:54] <tj_vantoll> Some of the existing options that we're removing are reasonable use cases, so we want to make sure that they're easy to accomplish with the rewrite.
[09:08:57] <jzaefferer> Still makes sense to me. There was at least one demo that promotes bad interactions that we want to delete, once we have it captured in the upgrade guide
[09:09:36] <tj_vantoll> I'll probably get started on documenting those, at least until fnagel can get his PR cleaned up and merged in.
[09:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> After the 1.11 release, I plan on going through the datepicker issues and categorizing them.
[09:11:11] <tj_vantoll> That's it for datepicker. There's a lot of good progress from fnagel, but we need him to get those changes cleaned up and merged in so we can go from there.
[09:11:29] <tj_vantoll> For selectmenu I tracked the current test failure down to subpixel rounding.
[09:11:43] <tj_vantoll> So I have a PR open to switch that test to using closeEnough() https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1275
[09:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's good to land.
[09:12:17] <tj_vantoll> Ok I'll do that now.
[09:12:30] <tj_vantoll> That's it for selectmenu (that I know of).
[09:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything they want to get in before the 1.11.0 release?
[09:13:51] <tj_vantoll> I'll merge in my PR so we can have green tests before 1.11 :)
[09:15:17] <jzaefferer> I think we're good
[09:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Will you be around after the dev leads meeting?
[09:16:24] <jzaefferer> No
[09:16:28] <jzaefferer> Unfortunately not
[09:16:51] <jzaefferer> But I'll be available all day tomorrow and Friday
[09:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok. Should I do the release this afternoon or should we do it togheter tomorrow morning?
[09:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's do it tomorrow morning.
[09:17:38] <jzaefferer> I think its fine if you run the release script today and get everything on stage
[09:17:45] <mikesherov_> Anytime is fine by me
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> I can do that.
[09:17:55] <jzaefferer> Then we can review everything and publish tomorrow
[09:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:18:20] <jzaefferer> I guess the changelog will still eat a lot of time
[09:18:39] <tj_vantoll> Why?
[09:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can work on that after running the release script.
[09:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> Because there's a lot of manual formatting involved.
[09:18:52] <jzaefferer> There are a lot of tiny things we haven't automated. The changelog is a rather big chunk of work
[09:19:16] <jzaefferer> There's also a lot of lint commits and the like that we don't want to list
[09:19:47] <jzaefferer> For beta.2 I think I filtered 500 commits down to 150. Maybe even more, can't quite remember
[09:20:01] <jzaefferer> And I didn't even to the categorizing
[09:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> Right, compare http://jqueryui.com/changelog/1.10.4/ to http://jqueryui.com/changelog/1.11.0-beta.2/
[09:20:22] <jzaefferer> *do
[09:20:39] <tj_vantoll> Gotcha
[09:21:14] <jzaefferer> The generated file had 908 lines
[09:21:28] <jzaefferer> "Updated author information." yay
[09:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:21:50] <jzaefferer> Though like 500 of those are from selectmenu
[09:22:23] <jzaefferer> 400
[09:22:31] <jzaefferer> Still leaves 500 lines to review...
[09:22:41] <jzaefferer> So yeah, that still sucks :-)
[09:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not :-)
[09:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll start the release process this afternoon and finalize it tomorrow morning.
