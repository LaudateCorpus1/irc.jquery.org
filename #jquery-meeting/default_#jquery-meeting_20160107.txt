[12:01:15] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:21] <bethge> hi
[12:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess it's just us.
[12:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> The offsetX/Y polyfill is still waiting on a review from Jacob.
[12:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/233
[12:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Have you had any time to look into the ChromeDriver stuff?
[12:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/245
[12:04:47] <arschmitz> shoot no i had totally forgotten
[12:04:53] <arschmitz> ill try to do it this week
[12:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> No problem. I just assumed everyone else did nothing over the holidays, like me :-P
[12:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> I landed bethge's PR for suppressing boundary events during capture.
[12:08:19] <bethge> Yay :)
[12:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/195
[12:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> I also filed a new issue for the other half of that: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/254
[12:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> The issue: what happens after capture is released and the pointer is over a different element.
[12:09:58] <bethge> Did the w3c group decide on the expected bahaviour?
[12:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> Hmmm...I don't recall the discussion going anywhere, but it was so long ago.
[12:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll find the thread and see.
[12:11:44] <bethge> Found the gh issue: https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/15
[12:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just read through the mailing list discussion too.
[12:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> So no answer yet.
[12:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I think this is the conversation that lead to me realizing jQuery UI's autocomplete behavior needed to change :-P
[12:13:51] <bethge> hehe
[12:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, we never released 0.4.1
[12:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I should do that since we had to work around that Firefox bug.
[12:17:37] <bethge> yeah, probably. mbrubeck mentioned it would the fix would be realeased in March 2016
[12:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> yup :-)
[12:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> So probably around mid-year, we can remove the workaround.
[12:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:20:59] <bethge> I was wondering about the unit tests. Should be remove them eventually?
[12:21:07] <bethge> s/be/we
[12:21:08] <b-ot> Correction, <bethge> I was wondering about the unit tests. Should we remove them eventually?
[12:23:12] <bethge> You mentioned relying on the functional w3c tests for correctness (https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/192). Should we still aim to fix the unit tests?
[12:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> I think relying on functional tests if ine.
[12:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> s/if ine/is fine/
[12:24:24] <b-ot> Correction, <scott_gonzalez> I think relying on functional tests is fine.
[12:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to get higher test coverage before we drop the unit tests.
[12:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> Though I wouldn't object to just removing tests that are currently failing.
[12:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> Since we're obviously neglecting them anyway.
[12:26:51] <bethge> I looked into it a bit, and some are related to IE11 IE10 ms-environment, others to when a DOMException should be thrown and when not (I believe the draft was changed after the tests were written)
[12:27:39] <bethge> There is one outstanding PR by jdalton for functional tests: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/226, haven't looked at it, but I can work on written some more of those visual tests
[12:28:04] <bethge> s/visual/functional/
[12:28:05] <b-ot> Correction, <bethge> There is one outstanding PR by jdalton for functional tests: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/226, haven't looked at it, but I can work on written some more of those functional tests
[12:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[12:32:27] <bethge> Alrighty, great :)
[12:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[14:00:49] <arschmitz> agcolom: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: apsdehal: cgack: sfrisk: meeting time!
[14:00:56] <sfrisk> yo
[14:01:04] <cgack> happy new year!
[14:01:36] <agcolom> hello, happy new year also to all :-)
[14:01:36] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:01:45] <jasperdegroot> happy new year all
[14:02:02] <agcolom> arschmitz: I think we should create a new doc for the notes for 2016
[14:02:09] <arschmitz> already did
[14:02:33] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=261356364
[14:03:37] <agcolom> great! Thanks :-)
[14:03:57] <arschmitz> lets get started
[14:03:58] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:04:06] <arschmitz> we are still getting very close to 1.5
[14:04:13] <arschmitz> things were slow over the holiday
[14:04:25] <arschmitz> but apsdehal has done a ton for finishing up some straggling things
[14:04:51] <arschmitz> UI released 1.12 beta
[14:05:12] <arschmitz> i have a very rough draft of a blog post i more or less just outlined
[14:05:24] <arschmitz> comments suggestions and hate messages welcome lol
[14:05:40] <arschmitz> hopefully not many of the last
[14:05:57] <arschmitz> i actually plan 2 posts for next week
[14:06:00] <arschmitz> this one monday
[14:06:07] <arschmitz> and then a second one for the IE drop
[14:06:34] <jasperdegroot> maybe wait until next week with the second one
[14:06:37] <arschmitz> because i didnt want this to get lost in the IE ness
[14:06:38] <jasperdegroot> spread it a bit
[14:06:50] <arschmitz> the ie ones are a big effort
[14:06:53] <arschmitz> and all going on the same day
[14:07:00] <arschmitz> its not just us
[14:07:15] <gabrielschulhof> The Web will have a field day.
[14:07:26] <gabrielschulhof> I can just see the memes.
[14:07:57] <arschmitz> so we could do the ie one first and then the update the week after
[14:08:06] <arschmitz> but i would rather try to get the update on monday
[14:08:09] <sfrisk> *in edit modE*
[14:08:13] <arschmitz> and then do the ie one tuesday
[14:08:33] <arschmitz> what does everyone else think?
[14:09:05] <jasperdegroot> yeah update first
[14:09:40] <cgack> update ASAP i think
[14:09:44] <arschmitz> so blogs 2 days in a row it is then
[14:09:58] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:10:03] <arschmitz> because we have an unwritten policy about doing stuff on fridays
[14:10:08] <arschmitz> because no one pays attention
[14:10:48] <arschmitz> ok so gabrielschulhof whats the status on selectmenu?
[14:10:52] <jasperdegroot> yeah monday is fine
[14:11:11] <gabrielschulhof> I ran into a bit of an issue while removing pagehide.
[14:11:20] <gabrielschulhof> It seems page itself uses pagehide.
[14:11:48] <gabrielschulhof> ... and there's a whole kludgy setup where we override bindRemove so as to prevent the page disappearing when we pop the dialog-sized select.
[14:12:05] <gabrielschulhof> It's been there since, like, forever, with a comment saying it needs cleaning up.
[14:12:15] <arschmitz> oh right
[14:12:21] <gabrielschulhof> I think we should, but then we're kinda pressed for time :/
[14:12:27] <arschmitz> i thought that got cleaned up and remove was moved to pagecontainer but i guess not
[14:12:41] <gabrielschulhof> I tried replacing it with a simple refcounter, but, as usual, it's not as simple.
[14:13:24] <arschmitz> ok well we can move forward and just ignore for now if we need to right
[14:13:29] <gabrielschulhof> So, I'm kinda torn between just steamrolling it (again), and fixing it properly.
[14:13:43] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so steamrolling it is.
[14:13:47] <arschmitz> its hard i want to get done quick
[14:13:55] <arschmitz> but i thought we already fixed this and it is deprecated
[14:14:06] <arschmitz> but would not be the first time we did this sort of buy down
[14:14:08] <gabrielschulhof> No, unfortunately :(
[14:14:35] <arschmitz> for purposes of selectmenu
[14:14:42] <arschmitz> just steamroll i think
[14:14:48] <gabrielschulhof> ij
[14:14:49] <arschmitz> and maybe we can get this in after beta before final
[14:14:52] <gabrielschulhof> ok
[14:15:22] <arschmitz> any other blockers on selectmenu?
[14:15:49] <gabrielschulhof> I don't think so.
[14:15:54] <arschmitz> ok sounds good
[14:16:04] <arschmitz> just let me know when your ready for another review
[14:16:06] <gabrielschulhof> There'll be a bear of a time integrating it with apsdehal's test setup.
[14:16:24] <gabrielschulhof> *chugga chugga*
[14:16:32] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats still blocked externally
[14:17:19] <arschmitz> cgack: whats the status on table
[14:17:49] <cgack> pretty much the same as before the break, I managed to avoid computering for the last two weeks
[14:18:03] <arschmitz> ok
[14:18:13] <arschmitz> so same as gabrielschulhof let me know when you need review
[14:18:21] <cgack> still some test cleanup to do with hasClasses and lacks then it'll be ready for a full review
[14:18:22] <gabrielschulhof> Will do.
[14:18:50] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:19:00] <arschmitz> apsdehal: got an awesome start on panel
[14:19:04] <arschmitz> just waiting on my review
[14:19:15] <arschmitz> and has prs for a few other 1.5 issues
[14:19:26] <arschmitz> i think all 1.5 issues now have working PR's!
[14:19:50] <gabrielschulhof> *whew* ...
[14:20:24] <arschmitz> ok does anyone have anything else today?
[14:21:22] <gabrielschulhof> I'm good ...
[14:21:28] <sfrisk> Nope, I should have a pass done of blog post suggestions done soon
