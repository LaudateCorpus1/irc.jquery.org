[09:00:20] <kborchers> ohai
[09:00:20] * rxaviers here
[09:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll start without jzaefferer and gnarf
[09:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> So, obviously 1.9.0 was released :-)
[09:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't have too many issues.
[09:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> A few hiccups with the download builder, but we've got those under control for now
[09:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> One thing that remains a problem is that download builder doesn't work properly if there's more than one directory inside the release directory.
[09:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to pass in a version number in the query string to make that work properly.
[09:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> Which is something that we need before 1.10 anyway.
[09:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be doing a full review of download builder soon.
[09:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> Possibly at the summit or maybe the following week while jzaefferer is here.
[09:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> We've got two months till the planned beta for 1.10.
[09:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I will be working on dialog after the summit.
[09:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> I assume kborchers will work on menubar.
[09:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> and progressbar
[09:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can get progressbar done at the summit with kborchers changes.
[09:09:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i could though i think jzaefferer put rafael on it … i can do both if you like
[09:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ah, ok
[09:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever jzaefferer wants :-P
[09:09:56] <kborchers> but if you finish progressbar at summit then i'll need something :)
[09:10:01] <rxaviers> <jzaefferer>    hey rxaviers, before you start getting bored, check out the Roadmap for new tasks: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[09:10:02] <rxaviers> :)
[09:10:13] <rxaviers> <jzaefferer>    rxaviers: Menubar would be a good starting point for you, needs a proper spec, unit tests, better API for customizing button styles...
[09:10:22] <jzaefferer> hey
[09:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> hey jzaefferer: Can you update the roadmap to list out names for each component?
[09:14:41] <jzaefferer> sure
[09:15:09] <jzaefferer> I'll just spend five minutes logging in to pbworks!!1
[09:16:00] <jzaefferer> added two names for the 1.10 release
[09:16:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do you want that for 1.11 as well? doesn't seem very useful to me
[09:16:25] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you're still up for menubar?
[09:16:37] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, whatever you guys decide is fine for me
[09:16:44] <jzaefferer> I take that as a yes
[09:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> No, just 1.10.
[09:16:51] <rxaviers> definitely ;)
[09:17:05] <jzaefferer> I've put your name in there now. I assume we'll collaborate closely on that.
[09:17:12] <rxaviers> ok
[09:17:30] <jzaefferer> I'll also support Felix on Selectmenu and Scott on Dialog, the latter especially the week after the summit
[09:17:36] <kborchers> jzaefferer: where would you like me after progressbar since scott mentioned trying to kill that at summit?
[09:17:38] <jzaefferer> We'll see how that works out
[09:17:49] <jzaefferer> kborchers: let's no get ahead of ourself ;)
[09:17:57] <kborchers> ok :)
[09:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:18:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: there's plenty site stuff to tackle until January as well
[09:18:56] <jzaefferer> kborchers: demo system?
[09:19:09] <jzaefferer> we should brainstorm the demo system at the summit
[09:19:11] <jzaefferer> MAKE A PLAN
[09:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:19:26] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i'm up for what ever … won't be at summit though
[09:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone has stuff that we should work on or discuss at the summit, let me know.
[09:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm compiling a list.
[09:21:43] <jzaefferer> so popup isn't anywhere on the roadmap
[09:21:50] <jzaefferer> we need to figure that one out as well
[09:22:02] <jzaefferer> probably rip it out from the menubar branch, into its own
[09:22:11] <jzaefferer> or decide to just kill it and never speak about it again
[09:22:29] <jzaefferer> eventually we want to make it trivial to create a contextmenu
[09:22:40] <jzaefferer> 1.9 doesn't even have a contextmenu demo
[09:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> Let's talk about it at the summit.
[09:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that's about it.
[09:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> Good work on 1.9.0 everyone.
[09:36:00] <jzaefferer> (party)
[09:36:08] <jzaefferer> also run&coke™
[09:36:31] <jzaefferer> kinda sad that its easier to type ™ then € on a Mac US keyboard...
[09:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> heh
