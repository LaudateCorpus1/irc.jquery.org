[09:00:30] <timmywil> hai
[09:00:37] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1su2ZTFZbnp_DD-LGZleuEudTFRJT_g4zf7UfGOMQvco/edit
[09:00:52] <DaveMethvin> hi guyz
[09:01:18] <gibson042> hi Fearless Leader
[09:01:33] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:02:24] <DaveMethvin> fearless, haha
[09:02:30] <DaveMethvin> leader, haha
[09:02:45] <DaveMethvin> btw gibson042  thanks for the sizzle commit
[09:02:48] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:03:07] <gibson042> if only I'd been 5 minutes earlier, eh?
[09:03:22] <DaveMethvin> well i really shoulda seen that ticket
[09:03:39] <DaveMethvin> my eyes must not have been working
[09:03:53] <gibson042> it should have been a blocker, but I don't think it was
[09:03:56] <DaveMethvin> i have been trying to juggle too much stuff at once lately
[09:04:19] <DaveMethvin> so thinking about it this weekend i think we can just do an RC2
[09:04:24] <DaveMethvin> and not mention RC1
[09:04:31] <gibson042> +1
[09:04:34] <DaveMethvin> that way we don't need to unpublish or clobber anything
[09:04:54] <DaveMethvin> and after several false starts i got a vm running over the weekend
[09:05:00] <DaveMethvin> i am gonna try to publish from it
[09:05:36] <DaveMethvin> i had a really crazy problem with a couple of Ubuntu images, all the non-alpha chars on the keyboard were incorrectly mapped
[09:05:43] <DaveMethvin> so i gave up and used Debian
[09:05:59] <markelog> wow
[09:06:00] <markelog> debian
[09:06:32] <DaveMethvin> not a great desktop build but hey it seems to work, i just use the shell
[09:06:53] <DaveMethvin> and the rm -rf is just peachy
[09:07:05] <markelog> will you rebuild the kernel?
[09:07:07] <markelog> )
[09:07:12] <DaveMethvin> BE A MAN!
[09:07:25] <DaveMethvin> i did build node/npm from scratch
[09:07:27] <DaveMethvin> never done that
[09:07:56] <DaveMethvin> so anyway, I'll do an RC2 a little later today now that I have this VM
[09:08:04] <DaveMethvin> at least I'll TRY to do that, we'll see how it goes
[09:08:35] <DaveMethvin> over the weekend i saw that several people were advocating using a "browser" tag for client packages on npm
[09:08:41] <DaveMethvin> seemed like a good idea
[09:09:24] <DaveMethvin> of course we can run on node as well but we're mainly browser
[09:09:38] <DaveMethvin> maybe they need a browseronly
[09:09:44] <DaveMethvin> which we would NOT be
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> in any case it's pretty easy to add to our npmTags in release.js if we want to
[09:10:45] <DaveMethvin> thoughts?
[09:11:48] <timmywil> I was under the impression that adding any tag to npm publish prevented you from publishing the package as the latest version.
[09:12:00] <timmywil> like --tag beta
[09:12:16] <timmywil> didn't think "beta" actually had special meaning in npm, but maybe it does
[09:12:30] <DaveMethvin> let's check the docs for npm publish
[09:12:48] <timmywil> last I checked, the docs were severely lacking in this area
[09:13:20] <DaveMethvin> in npm-tag it says publishing always sets the "latest" tag
[09:13:33] <DaveMethvin> i think that's what was biting us originally with publsh order
[09:13:43] <timmywil> that's default though
[09:14:00] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:14:29] <timmywil> I know we've kept (at least some) beta releases from publishing as latest
[09:15:25] <timmywil> Point is, we don't want to make people type npm install jquery@browser
[09:15:33] <DaveMethvin> definitely
[09:15:47] <DaveMethvin> i think it's just to allow people to find the client side plugins easier
[09:16:13] <DaveMethvin> sorry i meant keywords ...
[09:16:20] <timmywil> oh, heh, maybe I'm thinking of this wrong. We could do that with a keyword
[09:16:26] <timmywil> ok
[09:16:28] <timmywil> :P
[09:16:48] <timmywil> REWIND
[09:16:58] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah
[09:17:02] <DaveMethvin> ok so let
[09:17:17] <DaveMethvin> s see if jquery-release supports keywords, don't think it does atm
[09:17:41] <DaveMethvin> nope
[09:17:51] <timmywil> I'd assume we'd just add it to our package.json
[09:17:51] <DaveMethvin> okay well we would need to add that
[09:18:05] <DaveMethvin> and then Release.npmKeywords
[09:18:10] <DaveMethvin> i assume
[09:19:09] <timmywil> npm publish publishes whatever is set in our package.json. I think we're good.
[09:20:16] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[09:20:17] <DaveMethvin> duh
[09:21:23] <DaveMethvin> so, thoughts on what we should do to ensure jQuery doesn't fall behind on its Sizzle?
[09:21:50] <DaveMethvin> for this case the ticket should have been marked with higher priority, but the short answer was that I just missed it
[09:21:50] <timmywil> We still need to implement that warning in the release
[09:21:56] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:22:13] <timmywil> I should be able to do that when I'm in San Fran this week
[09:22:33] <DaveMethvin> so would you just check for the latest Sizzle commit to master being tagged?
[09:22:55] <timmywil> hmm
[09:23:08] <DaveMethvin> an occasional false warning doesn't bother me
[09:23:19] <DaveMethvin> that's better than missing something
[09:23:31] <timmywil> Yea, I guess that would be 2 checks
[09:23:52] <timmywil> 1 to check if there have been any commits since the latest tag on Sizzle and 1 to ensure that jQuery has the latest tag
[09:24:19] <DaveMethvin> true
[09:24:30] <gibson042> the first one seems like overkill to me
[09:24:52] <gnarf> hrm
[09:24:52] <timmywil> well, the 2nd check would have passed this time right?
[09:24:54] <DaveMethvin> the first was how we got into trouble for the beta1 release tho
[09:25:07] <gnarf> but it would be some pain for sizzle dev
[09:25:11] <gibson042> it would catch some mistakes, including the recent one, but it just feels icky
[09:25:15] <timmywil> I mean, these are warnings. The point is to be aware.
[09:25:21] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:25:27] <gnarf> unless we only tested this on pre-release
[09:25:30] <DaveMethvin> and they appear for one person, the person doing the release
[09:25:55] <gnarf> don't want reds showing up in swarm/travis because sizzle is +1 commit from its tag during dev cycle yeah?
[09:26:08] <timmywil> this is not a build check
[09:26:22] <gnarf> so only pre-release then
[09:26:29] <DaveMethvin> no, always on every release
[09:26:29] <timmywil> right
[09:26:41] <timmywil> well, I assume you both mean the same thing
[09:26:50] <gnarf> pre-flight during release
[09:26:55] <DaveMethvin> "not a build check"
[09:27:10] <DaveMethvin> you mean, not done for building the "built files"
[09:27:11] <timmywil> as in, this is not something we check on travis
[09:27:21] <DaveMethvin> right we don't check it on travis
[09:27:39] <DaveMethvin> this would be in /build/release.js and run by jquery-release
[09:27:50] <timmywil> boom
[09:28:19] <DaveMethvin> basically this is a "hey you may be doing something wrong here, but if you know what you're doing go ahead"
[09:29:10] <DaveMethvin> ok soo
[09:29:19] <DaveMethvin> can i get a volunteer on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14824 ?
[09:29:19] <timmywil> Right, the person doing the release should be fully aware of the state of Sizzle.
[09:29:45] <gibson042> is that the same as http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15037?
[09:30:01] <DaveMethvin> related if not the same gibson042
[09:30:54] <DaveMethvin> i agree we kind of made a mess of this
[09:31:00] <DaveMethvin> ideally people would just use classes
[09:31:11] <DaveMethvin> and then they'd get transitions for free as well
[09:31:27] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should just tell people to stop using show/hide ...
[09:33:18] <gibson042> but we actually did regress, right?
[09:33:25] <DaveMethvin> appears so
[09:33:59] <DaveMethvin> just looking for the commit, it was to fix another problem i seem to remember it
[09:34:06] <markelog> probably one of ours commits to showHide helper
[09:34:37] <gibson042> that seems likely
[09:34:51] <markelog> i can take this one for the weekend
[09:35:17] <DaveMethvin> that would be awesome markelog
[09:35:26] <markelog> okay then
[09:36:14] <DaveMethvin> speaking of trac... what a pain
[09:36:20] <DaveMethvin> dunno why the spam has gotten worse
[09:36:48] <markelog> why don't we use github issues?
[09:37:07] <markelog> legacy?
[09:37:10] <markelog> or?
[09:37:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah mostly
[09:37:32] <DaveMethvin> and gh issues is not very featureful
[09:37:43] <DaveMethvin> i think we could probalby adapt tags to make it work
[09:38:00] <timmywil> I think the mobile guys would advise against that
[09:38:00] <markelog> do we want to use github for that?
[09:38:25] <DaveMethvin> well also we have so many bugs in trac and i don't think there's a way to import them
[09:38:56] <timmywil> Nah, don't migrate, just say, "NO MOAR BUGS"
[09:39:01] <markelog> )
[09:39:06] <DaveMethvin> we got no bugs!
[09:39:38] <DaveMethvin> i think there may be a way to tweak the captcha, but i hate captchas
[09:39:48] <gibson042> I'm holding out for scott_gonzalez's tracker :)
[09:39:54] <DaveMethvin> most likely our trac setup just needs some lovin care
[09:40:12] <DaveMethvin> haha, #debt will never be done!
[09:40:22] <markelog> hmm, don't like to care about things )
[09:40:36] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice if gh issues had better tagging/reporting
[09:41:09] <DaveMethvin> okay, that's about all i have
[09:41:18] <DaveMethvin> i will do a release a bit later today
[09:41:25] <DaveMethvin> rc2
[09:41:29] <markelog> debian rules!
[09:41:33] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:41:47] <DaveMethvin> well i will say it rules if i get the release done from it
[09:41:56] <DaveMethvin> but it should do better than Windows for sure
[09:42:04] <DaveMethvin> anybody got anything else?
[09:42:19] <DaveMethvin> let's call this baby done!
[09:42:33] <DaveMethvin> see you guys in -dev
