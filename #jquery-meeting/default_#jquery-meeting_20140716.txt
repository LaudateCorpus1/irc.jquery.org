[09:02:37] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:37] <kborchers> yo
[09:02:46] <jperrault> hello
[09:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxvaiers isn't here, so we'll skip DB and Globalize.
[09:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll and I did some datepicker review.
[09:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> We got some updates on the planning wiki today and worked through a few open questions.
[09:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be doing another pass over the comments today based on that.
[09:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> I also started triaging the datepicker tickets. That's mostly done.
[09:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> The datepicker branch has been rebased and the history has been cleaned up.
[09:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> And there's a new PR for the calendar split: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1281
[09:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> Which has already been rebased and partly cleaned up.
[09:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to clean it up some more before merging.
[09:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything specific about datepicker they want to discuss?
[09:07:18] <mikesherov_> hi
[09:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> Hey mikesherov_. So far I've just given an update on datepicker.
[09:08:09] <jperrault> IBM said we don't need the verbiage so you can process my PR.
[09:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> Great. Can you just add a comment on the PR saying that?
[09:08:52] <jperrault> will do
[09:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> When I merge it, the commits will get squashed and there should be history showing that you agreed to have that removed.
[09:09:14] <jperrault> vg
[09:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a few regressions that need to be fixed: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=!closed&keywords=~regression&report=40
[09:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: Do you have time to look at the interaction regressions?
[09:11:22] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: sure
[09:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:11:45] <mikesherov_> I and Dave Stein are actually actively setting aside time every week for jQUery UI now
[09:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:12:42] <mikesherov_> so, this one: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10147 ?
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10140
[09:14:27] <mikesherov_> OK
[09:15:01] <mikesherov_> On a side note, Dave STein is currently in hell trying to get his rewrite (which is finally rebased from 2 years ago) to pass the current test suite
[09:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> Test failures that already existed in the rewrite or new failures from the rebase?
[09:16:31] <mikesherov_> both kinda
[09:17:12] <tj_vantoll> here now
[09:17:33] <mikesherov_> I need to grab some lunch. Just a quick update from me: me and Dave Stein are back in action, and will release JSCS 1.6.0 in the next few weeks so I'll bring it to UI when it's done
[09:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> woohoo
[09:18:13] <tj_vantoll> I looked into http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10152 and it confused me.
[09:18:24] <tj_vantoll> I can tackle the menu one.
[09:18:28] <tj_vantoll> Or try to at least.
[09:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> Could be a bug in core.
[09:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> The menu one is definitely tricky.
[09:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that generating wrapper spans is a good idea.
[09:19:39] <tj_vantoll> I'm not either, but I don't have a better idea.
[09:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> We might be able to detach the submenus though.
[09:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> But that could break selectors.
[09:19:51] <tj_vantoll> ugh
[09:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have any good ideas for this.
[09:21:12] <tj_vantoll> I want to see how messy spans are. It shouldn't be too bad to implement to see.
[09:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't like the idea of us generating markup in the middle of user content.
[09:22:59] <tj_vantoll> We could try to "undo" the ui-state-focus rules in nested submenus.
[09:23:53] <tj_vantoll> But that's messy too.
[09:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, especially since it'd be putting theme settings into structural settings.
[09:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> And would require custom themes to do it as well.
[09:25:24] <tj_vantoll> And people could have custom rules applied to ui-state-focus.
[09:25:51] <tj_vantoll> I can toy with it and see, but this is hard.
[09:27:01] <tj_vantoll> Anyways, I have to take off momentarily. My only other update is on web components. I got dialog kind of sort of working as a component http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/5Bm7C/
[09:27:57] <tj_vantoll> But I didn't get into a lot of the edge cases where the real problems are.
[09:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> So are we ready to schedule a meeting with Polymer?
[09:29:40] <tj_vantoll> I think so. I think we know where we stand at a high level at least now.
[09:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:30:21] <arschmitz> i have a button update finally
[09:30:25] <tj_vantoll> Should we ping Addy about that, or do you have other contacts?
[09:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> Just ping Addy. He'll get whoever is needed from Polymer.
[09:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Oh yeah, I saw some commits come through this morning.
[09:31:12] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Will do.
[09:31:22] <arschmitz> finished cleaning up the tests and adding new tests so its ready for jzaefferer to review again when hes back around
[09:31:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: being away from internet ironically gave me time to work on it
[09:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:32:33] <arschmitz> acttually 2 of the other times i got a lot done on it were on long flights away from the internet ha ha
[09:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> That's how recursive-blame got written :-)
[09:33:03] <arschmitz> yeah russia right?
[09:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:33:43] <arschmitz> no emails to respond to or issues to look at
[09:33:48] <arschmitz> can actually WORK
[09:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[09:34:10] <arschmitz> nope
[09:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:34:28] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
