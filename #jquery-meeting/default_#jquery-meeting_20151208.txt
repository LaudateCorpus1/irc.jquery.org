[14:06:09] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:06:20] <sfrisk> hiii
[14:06:44] <geekman-rohit> so I have been not so healthy since 2 weeks, but things look good now
[14:07:28] <sfrisk> Well, I'm glad you're feeling better
[14:07:39] <geekman-rohit> me too
[14:08:27] <sfrisk> Ok, so here is the base deliverable list for Phase one https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3j69bjpc-IH5roXhIYhSOGfL4SE10pZvMvKuetpJ_s/edit?usp=sharing
[14:08:41] <sfrisk> I've got the btn pr like halfway done, going to try and finish it up tonight
[14:09:19] <geekman-rohit> last time i was here I remember we talked of deciding a deadline to get us all to work faster
[14:09:24] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:09:44] <geekman-rohit> that looks good
[14:09:52] <geekman-rohit> lets add a deadline column
[14:09:57] <sfrisk> that's the list of things that need to get done, if it sounds good, we can spend this meeting figuring out who can work on what, and when they deliver by
[14:10:22] <geekman-rohit> that sounds good
[14:11:53] <geekman-rohit> umm its view only
[14:11:54] <geekman-rohit> cant edit
[14:11:58] <sfrisk> tweaked permissions so you can edit it
[14:12:20] <kristyjy> sorry I'm late my meeting went long
[14:12:23] <sfrisk> that's okay
[14:12:33] <sfrisk> deliverable: https://docs.google.com/a/sarahfrisk.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3j69bjpc-IH5roXhIYhSOGfL4SE10pZvMvKuetpJ_s/edit?usp=sharing

[14:14:42] <kristyjy> just requested access
[14:14:52] <sfrisk> bah okay
[14:15:06] <sfrisk> try again
[14:15:11] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3j69bjpc-IH5roXhIYhSOGfL4SE10pZvMvKuetpJ_s/edit?usp=sharing
[14:15:20] <kristyjy> thanks
[14:15:26] <sfrisk> Today in : Does Sarah Know How to Use Google Docs
[14:15:29] <sfrisk> (the answer is no)
[14:15:41] <kristyjy> lol to be fair we've been having trouble with public docs at work too
[14:16:11] <sfrisk> ok, so anyway, those are the big things on that list for phase one
[14:16:38] <sfrisk> also I noticed a bug while I was working on the btn pr - the grunt watch task does not watch for changes in any of the variable js files
[14:16:57] <sfrisk> so if you change those files, the resulting sass file does not get updated
[14:17:50] <geekman-rohit> i never used our grunt watch task
[14:17:52] <geekman-rohit> :D
[14:19:11] <sfrisk> yeah, we have a PR that adds a note to the readme that it is a thing https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/132
[14:19:20] <sfrisk> although he hasn't updated the sentence update I requested
[14:20:13] <geekman-rohit> been 2 months since his last push
[14:20:14] <geekman-rohit> almost
[14:20:22] <sfrisk> yeah, it was at the jquery dev conf
[14:20:34] <sfrisk> I had hoped the people there would contribute more, they seemed excited
[14:20:43] <sfrisk> the stuff that wasn't finished I might just close and we can finish it
[14:20:45] <geekman-rohit> we might as well pull his commits and add changes ourselves
[14:20:57] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:21:43] <geekman-rohit> is deliver by supposed to be a date?
[14:21:44] <sfrisk> I'll also finish up Build: Upgrade JSCS #137
[14:21:50] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:22:01] <sfrisk> figured we might want to talk about that together as a group
[14:22:15] <sfrisk> since I know at least half of us are going to have winter holiday vacations
[14:22:25] <geekman-rohit> not me :(
[14:22:28] <geekman-rohit> still
[14:22:38] <geekman-rohit> I think I can pull out 2 weekends for chassis
[14:22:54] <geekman-rohit> and that should be enough to finish meter/progress coz I want to work on tables
[14:22:57] <geekman-rohit> i love tables
[14:23:01] <geekman-rohit> <3 :D
[14:23:33] <sfrisk> and a lot of tables is done, it's taking the stuff michealarestad did
[14:23:37] <sfrisk> and finishing it up
[14:23:42] <kristyjy> I need to finish the style guide so I can work on something is fun lol
[14:23:52] <sfrisk> you're so close!
[14:24:22] <kristyjy> as you said I do have some vacation for the holidays hopefully I can get some time during them the chill at the house and finish the style guide
[14:24:44] <sfrisk> if you want we can have a Portland Chassis day
[14:24:49] <sfrisk> sorry geekman-rohit :-(
[14:25:27] <kristyjy> sounds good but I might not be able to during vacation. I'll let you know when my plans are more finalized though
[14:25:31] <sfrisk> aww, no more geekman-rohit
[14:26:47] <sfrisk> yeah, part of my vacation may be internetless and I may not survive
[14:26:54] <sfrisk> being the computer obsessed person I am
[14:27:17] <geekman-rohit> system crashed
[14:28:28] <kristyjy> wb
[14:28:43] <sfrisk> fun times
[14:29:25] <geekman-rohit> i think we should set one final date to finish all
[14:29:36] <geekman-rohit> then work our way back and set dates for independent tasks
[14:29:55] <sfrisk> sounds good
[14:29:59] <geekman-rohit> also I'll take out some time every day to review PRs starting today
[14:30:06] <sfrisk> yeah, me too
[14:30:12] <geekman-rohit> so we don't have PRs waiting reviews
[14:30:27] <sfrisk> and close out the ones that have been sitting unfinished too long
[14:31:59] <sfrisk> I think if we all had the time to work 10-20 hours a week (and did it) we could get a lot of this done within 2 months
[14:32:33] <sfrisk> life being life, however, let's make a goal for  March 8th
[14:32:38] <sfrisk> 3 months from today
[14:32:40] <geekman-rohit> that sounds fun
[14:33:18] <sfrisk> I almost wish github had a jira / agile friendly system, would make organizing issues for weekly work easier
[14:33:43] <geekman-rohit> never used thoese
[14:33:49] <geekman-rohit> march 8 seems good
[14:34:31] <sfrisk> okay, I'm gonna get buttons pr up soon, will ping you guys in the PR when it's up
[14:35:04] <sfrisk> which should be tonight
[14:35:11] <sfrisk> or latest tomrorow
[14:35:44] <geekman-rohit> ill clean up all my PRs this week
[14:35:55] <geekman-rohit> and ping people to review them
[14:36:06] <geekman-rohit> and decide a fate for them
[14:36:15] <sfrisk> sounds good, I'll do the same
[14:36:45] <sfrisk> okay, so for next week, we'll definitely have buttons up for PR
[14:37:23] <geekman-rohit> yay
[14:37:29] <sfrisk> and the pr list in general will be cleaned up, with some items pulled in or closed as needed
[14:37:32] <geekman-rohit> also we need a common styling
[14:37:50] <geekman-rohit> u know similar colors and stuff across components
[14:37:57] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:38:12] <sfrisk> my buttons PR is kiiiiiiinda mooching from bootstrap, colors, which I rather not do
[14:38:33] <sfrisk> ... I'll put together some pallets, along with accessibility notes, see what we like?
[14:38:35] <geekman-rohit> we can take some inspiration from material design
[14:38:54] <geekman-rohit> https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html
[14:39:09] <sfrisk> def
[14:39:46] <sfrisk> get a basic palette together
[14:39:53] <sfrisk> that's like 6ish colors
[14:40:28] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[14:40:36] <geekman-rohit> i suck at olors
[14:40:39] <geekman-rohit> colors*
[14:40:44] <kristyjy> I also suck at colors lol
[14:40:47] <sfrisk> I might bug our designer here for help
[14:40:55] <kristyjy> sounds good :)
[14:42:45] <sfrisk> okay, so I think we all have some goals for this week, an dthe next few months
[14:42:55] <sfrisk> see everyone in the PRs this week!
[14:43:15] <geekman-rohit> no hack weekend?
[14:43:17] <geekman-rohit> :D
[14:44:26] <sfrisk> hack week!
[14:44:31] <sfrisk> although we need to do a weekend
[14:44:45] <sfrisk> my thing is for december... weekday nights might be freer for me
