[09:00:28] <gnarf> hey
[09:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> hey gnarf
[09:00:58] * gnarf shivers
[09:01:03] <gnarf> quick meeting?
[09:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> Anything interesting from infrastructure realted to UI?
[09:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not, I don't think we're waiting on anything.
[09:02:45] <gnarf> not really
[09:02:53] <gnarf> whats up with IE6 test timeouts?
[09:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: ?
[09:03:17] <Krinkle> ?
[09:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> Is that just slow tests or are there actual problems somewhere?
[09:03:22] <Krinkle> browserstack is awesome
[09:03:29] <Krinkle> I dont know
[09:03:38] <Krinkle> Is this jquery ui?
[09:03:40] <Krinkle> ah, topic
[09:03:42] <Krinkle> deja vu
[09:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, IE 6 is running tabs_deprecated right now
[09:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll see if it hangs :-P
[09:03:55] <Krinkle> Yes, IE6 is passing as of today
[09:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/65
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> You said we can run multiple instances of the same browser now, right?
[09:04:23] <Krinkle> Yes
[09:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, so IE6 can finish in time now?
[09:04:43] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Previously stackLimit was 4 and duplicate workers was 1
[09:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> IE6 just died
[09:04:53] <gnarf> theres our first timeout on Tabs_Deprecated
[09:05:04] <Krinkle> now neither has a limit, but we still have an overall limit of 8 (which can be 8 different ones or 8 the same, or anywhere in between)
[09:05:24] <Krinkle> that overall limit of 8 is just what I set on swarm.jquery.org instead of 4
[09:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs just died too
[09:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> I can't imagine those taking more than 5 minutes.
[09:05:55] <Krinkle> I don't know the real limit, pending question from browserstack support
[09:05:55] <Krinkle> but 8 is working :)
[09:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> Let me run it manually.
[09:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> Now spinner just died.
[09:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> Something's wrong.
[09:06:21] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/65 was kicked of artificially from Jenkins just now
[09:06:27] <Krinkle> (4 minutes ago)
[09:07:12] <Krinkle> server is going crazy
[09:07:16] <Krinkle> ajax requests failing
[09:07:19] <Krinkle> on job page
[09:08:34] <Krinkle> no idea why it is failing..
[09:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> 43 seconds to run Tabs_deprecated in IE6 on BrowserStack.
[09:09:35] <gnarf> Krinkle: none of my job requests are faililng...
[09:10:28] <Krinkle> it refreshed fine for a while
[09:10:44] <Krinkle> and then at some point it made 7000+ failing requests in < 2 mintues
[09:11:03] <gnarf> maybe when I restarted httpd?
[09:11:25] <Krinkle> now again, the ajax requests are stacking up like crazy, they're (pending) in chrome and the next one already starts
[09:11:28] <Krinkle> doesn't make any sense
[09:11:45] <gnarf> Krinkle: not here...
[09:12:00] <gnarf> Krinkle: also, why are you loading a second call before the first comes back?
[09:12:17] <Krinkle> I know, I was just looking at job.js
[09:12:24] <Krinkle> should be within the get() callback
[09:13:21] <gnarf> IE6 is still timing out
[09:13:22] <gnarf> a lot
[09:13:27] <gnarf> in the swarm environment
[09:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok, well let's continue this in #jqueryui-dev
[09:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer is working with Hans on tooltip a11y.
[09:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully they'll be able to cover some other widgets too.
[09:17:02] <kborchers> Menu please!
[09:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> Anybody have anything else to discuss?
[09:19:42] <gnarf> l8r!
