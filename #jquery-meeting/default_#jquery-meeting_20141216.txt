[10:00:58] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[10:01:28] <sfrisk> arschmitz, scott_gonzalez
[10:01:46] <arschmitz> Hi
[10:02:14] <sfrisk> kborchers: ianmaffett
[10:02:31] <sfrisk> uhhh, who else?
[10:02:45] <ianmaffett> hello
[10:03:16] <sfrisk> isaacdurazo: rxaviers__:
[10:03:24] <sfrisk> DaveMethvin: markelog_:
[10:03:35] <markelog_> hey-hey
[10:03:48] <DaveMethvin> here if you need me
[10:05:26] <sfrisk> Meeting notes: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:05:41] <sfrisk> (sorry got pulled away to sign for UPS deliveries)
[10:06:47] <sfrisk> Okay so I guess I'll go with Performance Testing first, have we heard any news on this, or should we start coming up with a new solution?
[10:07:58] <sfrisk> I know there was talk of kristoferjoseph and brianleroux working on it, but I haven't heard anything for the past few weeks
[10:08:24] <arschmitz> yeah i think we are are a point where its hard to move forward with out tests to set a perf base line
[10:09:00] <sfrisk> Probably the best solution in this case, so we can move this project forward
[10:10:31] <sfrisk> we already have an open issue for this, so that issue should probably get some focus so we can get that out of the way
[10:10:52] <arschmitz> yeah there is lots out there about setting this up
[10:11:02] <arschmitz> we just need to get it working
[10:11:17] <arschmitz> topcoat and bootstrap both have it
[10:11:30] <sfrisk> do you want to take point on that arschmitz? or at least we could start posting resources in the issue to see if someone wants to take than on
[10:11:32] <ianmaffett> http://topcoat.io/posts/benchmarks/
[10:11:40] <ianmaffett> Topcoat talks about how to setup the server
[10:11:51] <sfrisk> Awesome, thank you ianmaffett!
[10:11:53] <arschmitz> sfrisk: i have a collection of stuff already
[10:11:58] <arschmitz> from old css-framework issue
[10:12:02] <arschmitz> ill port it to the new issue
[10:12:27] <sfrisk> okay, sounds good
[10:13:57] <sfrisk> I posted the topcoat link in the issue too, and arschmitz can port in the stuff that was done in the old css framework days
[10:14:28] <sfrisk> Also, now that we have a name (huzzuh team Chassis!), we should probably get some domain names
[10:14:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: kborchers: can you help with this?
[10:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should be able to buy a domain.
[10:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to use jquery-wp-content or do your own thing?
[10:16:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: sfriskand i actually talked about this this morning
[10:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> Doing your own thing will probably allow for saner implemention of using Chassis within the site.
[10:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, you'll be burdened with updating all existing sites simultaneously.
[10:16:48] <arschmitz> and Jquery-wp-content seems like it would work well
[10:16:56] <arschmitz> but we may change our mind when we try it
[10:16:59] <arschmitz> :p
[10:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, even using jquery-wp-content, you could just not inherit from the base theme.
[10:17:23] <arschmitz> true
[10:17:33] <arschmitz> and the api docs are allready well suited
[10:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> Are they?
[10:17:53] <arschmitz> dont need to reinvent the wheel there
[10:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> Documenting CSS is not like documenting JS.
[10:18:18] <arschmitz> yeah much of how the widgets are documented in ui is pretty good
[10:18:43] <arschmitz> yeah but how the structure of widgets is documented is similar and works well so far
[10:19:15] <arschmitz> sfrisk: whats your feelings?
[10:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> You do realize that new structure means writing XSL, right? ;-)
[10:19:46] <sfrisk> *thinking*
[10:20:13] <arschmitz> yeah.... but its probably worth it in long run
[10:20:46] <sfrisk> I mean, it would encourage people to document things long term - because it's like the other sites, but you're right, documenting CSS is not like documenting JS
[10:21:50] <sfrisk> arschmitz and I had a discussion earlier today about how we would do it, and we were thinking about using aspects of what was already done in UI
[10:22:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, regarding the domain, feel free to file an issue and assign it to me.
[10:22:56] <sfrisk> okay shall do that now
[10:23:39] <sfrisk> I think this was the example arschmitz gave this morning: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[10:23:49] <sfrisk> and we were coming up with ways we could adapt that for Chassis
[10:24:30] <arschmitz> yeah the themeing and markup sections there
[10:24:38] <sfrisk> also, for anyone who doesn't know, we do have a #css-chassis channel now
[10:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> You realize that has nothing to do with the XML parsing and is just raw HTML, right?
[10:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> That would be much better served via markdown.
[10:25:28] <arschmitz> oh sorry yeah this is my fault
[10:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/accordion.xml#L38
[10:25:39] <arschmitz> i didnt mean that as an example of xsl
[10:25:48] <arschmitz> just that it was something that looked good
[10:25:56] <sfrisk> I think he meant it as an example of how to lay out the documentation
[10:26:17] <arschmitz> im not sure how exactly we would use the xslt
[10:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you would want to use XSLT.
[10:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> That was my point.
[10:26:35] <arschmitz> i was just saying before im not opposed to having to write it if there was a use case
[10:26:47] <arschmitz> im not sure there is but yeah
[10:27:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sfrisk assign the domain issue to me and let me know what domain you want ... csschassis.com and .org are avail and i could grab those now if that's what you want
[10:27:36] <sfrisk> okay, I'll reassign the task to you
[10:27:38] <arschmitz> kborchers: +1 on those
[10:27:53] <sfrisk> +1
[10:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> Wouldn't you want that hyphenated?
[10:28:07] <sfrisk> hyphanated might be nice for readability
[10:28:09] <arschmitz> i never use hyphens in domains if possible
[10:28:10] <kborchers> i hate hyphenated domains but what ever the project team wants
[10:28:15] <arschmitz> but im indifferent
[10:28:39] <arschmitz> kborchers: yeah pretty much but i dont care either way
[10:29:14] <kborchers> sfrisk: just let me know what domains you want in the issue and once they are noted there i will get them
[10:29:26] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:29:51] <sfrisk> I mean, I'm fine with both csschassis.com and css-chassis.com
[10:30:05] <sfrisk> css-chassis is a little bit easier to read, but I can understand not liking hyphens
[10:30:13] <arschmitz> anyone else have an opinion
[10:30:51] <sfrisk> looking through how we do our other domain names
[10:30:54] <jzaefferer> csschassis looks like CS Schassis, the hyphen avoids that
[10:31:12] <sfrisk> like "sizzlejs" and "qunitjs"
[10:31:29] <jzaefferer> chassiscss isn't much of an improvement ;)
[10:31:31] <sfrisk> chassiscss.com?  I
[10:31:35] <sfrisk> haha, yeah
[10:31:41] <sfrisk> I was just about to say that
[10:31:51] <jzaefferer> I voted for "Draft" :-)
[10:31:56] <sfrisk> lol
[10:31:59] <joebot0101> lol
[10:32:07] <joebot0101> in this case i think the hyphen is necessary
[10:32:14] <joebot0101> too many c's and s's
[10:32:18] <arschmitz> lol
[10:32:20] <sfrisk> yeah, with that manys c's and s's
[10:32:25] <sfrisk> many*
[10:33:27] <sfrisk> so kborchers: I vote add a dash for readability
[10:34:01] <sfrisk> plus that way it also matches the repo https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis
[10:34:13] <kborchers> ok, any objections to css-chassis.com?
[10:34:22] <arschmitz> none from me
[10:34:28] <jzaefferer> looks good
[10:35:10] <sfrisk> and joebot0101 I think is voting for dashes
[10:35:29] <arschmitz> by proxy i assume :)
[10:35:46] <sfrisk> well considering what he just said up above
[10:35:54] <joebot0101> confirmed
[10:35:58] <arschmitz> oh ha missed that
[10:36:02] <arschmitz> sorry
[10:36:28] <sfrisk> okay, so the agreement seems to be css-chassis.com for readability
[10:36:48] <jzaefferer> btw. joebot0101 since you're participating here, you should also join #css-chassis
[10:37:10] <joebot0101> done and thx
[10:37:37] <jzaefferer> since jquery-wp-content has support for markdown and you don't need to inherit from the base theme, you could just start with that and markdown files
[10:37:37] <sfrisk> Okay, so if that is agreed on, next topic is naming convention
[10:37:58] <sfrisk> That could work
[10:37:59] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i think we want jquery-wp-content for sure
[10:38:06] <arschmitz> not sure on the actual api setup
[10:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> To be clear, jquery-wp-content only supports HTML. grunt-jquery-content converts markdown to HTML.
[10:38:36] <jzaefferer> oh, right
[10:39:56] <kborchers> the jQuery Foundation now owns css-chassis.com and css-chassis.org and once a site is ready infrastructure can get everything wired up properly
[10:40:02] <sfrisk> thank you!
[10:40:06] <arschmitz> Awesome
[10:41:16] <arschmitz> so naming convention
[10:41:16] <sfrisk> okay, so that's handled, we'll definitely need to talk about/figure out documentation
[10:41:29] <sfrisk> but probably need code first, which leads into naming convention
[10:42:19] <sfrisk> so arschmitz and I woke up crazy early this morning and had a Skype call with the guys at Yandex who were behind BEM
[10:42:31] <arschmitz> I thought it was really productive
[10:42:45] <arschmitz> and they kinda changed my mind ( potentially )
[10:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have minutes from the meeting?
[10:43:04] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDtynv_VKHIQvkY9nisM20KWwWUUpI-K2RKjICGRDU4/edit?usp=sharing
[10:43:40] <sfrisk> That pretty much covers most of our discussion, and their responses to what questions/concerns we had
[10:44:02] <sfrisk> a lot of the ideas behind BEM, are actually already mostly being used in the UI projects
[10:44:25] <arschmitz> yeah the concept is very very similar to what we do in the ui theme already with naming
[10:44:51] <arschmitz> but they take the things in core.css and theme.css and make them mixins basically
[10:46:03] <arschmitz> which actually seems very sane to me its like the sass version of what we do already
[10:46:13] <sfrisk> what arschmitz said
[10:46:36] <arschmitz> and if you think about it that way the maintainability is actually easier
[10:46:57] <arschmitz> because you dont deel with issues of things being effected by specificity
[10:47:08] <arschmitz> because they avoid cascading
[10:47:17] <sfrisk> Overall I left the meeting with a positive view of BEM, and you're definitely not forced to have all those double dashes and whatnot - that was just their suggestion for separating elements and modifiers
[10:48:02] <arschmitz> yeah thats a good point they were clear about is the dashes underscores etc is totally up to you thats not really part of it thats just how they like to do it
[10:48:06] <sfrisk> definitely something that would cause a lot of repetition if we weren't using a preprocessor - but the preprocessor will make things very efficient
[10:48:35] <arschmitz> yeah i mean i dont think maintaing a mixin is any different then a class for the most part
[10:49:31] <arschmitz> they actually had very good answers for all our questions
[10:50:01] <sfrisk> not sure if mixin is the right word... probably want to use sass's   @extend
[10:50:09] <arschmitz> yes sorry
[10:50:13] <arschmitz> thats what they called them
[10:50:55] <sfrisk> But yeah, overall quite impressed with what they had to say - not sure if anyone else had anything they were concerned about regarding BEM
[10:52:51] <arschmitz> and topcoat has shown you can get CRAZY SMALL filesizes using it
[10:56:22] <sfrisk> So, not sure if that changes/confirms anyone's opinions on using BEM with an OOCSS like design or something?
[10:57:48] <sfrisk> yes? no? maybe so?
[10:58:27] <arschmitz> it did me
[10:58:34] <arschmitz> i like it much more now
[10:59:06] <joebot0101> i came to some of the same conclusions in my reading
[11:00:54] <sfrisk> Okay, so I'll post that in the issue thread
[11:01:24] <sfrisk> move the discussion maybe to how we specifically want to implement BEM (double dashes or something else for example)
[11:01:35] <sfrisk> and that pretty much brings us to the end of the meeting
[11:02:23] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:03:16] <sfrisk> okay, thanks for coming everyone, see you next week
[11:03:43] <sfrisk> Although someone else might need to run the meeting the week after (between Christmas and New Years), since I'll be traveling for the holidays with questionable internet access
[11:04:56] <sfrisk> or we could just agree to skip that tuesday
[11:05:11] <sfrisk> We can talk about that at next week's meeting though
[11:05:28] <sfrisk> talk to all of you later either in #jqueryui-dev or #css-chassis
