[10:03:11] <arthurvr> hey!
[10:03:17] <slayslot> Hello
[10:03:24] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[10:03:29] <sfrisk> `chassisteam
[10:03:29] <b-ot> sfrisk: agcolom, arschmitz, arthurvr, gnarf, helen, ianmaffett, jzaefferer, michaelarestad, rxaviers, sfrisk
[10:03:59] <geekman-rohit> hey everybody
[10:04:08] <noufal> hey
[10:04:12] <GreatDanton> hey
[10:04:45] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:04:58] <sfrisk> (Not quite finished, give me a moment)
[10:05:48] <marestad> Hi
[10:07:04] <sfrisk> Okay, first up, isaacdurazo, any update on logo stuff?
[10:07:56] <isaacdurazo> sfrisk sorry but no updates yet. I have been incredibly busy
[10:08:01] <isaacdurazo> I should have time this week
[10:08:02] <sfrisk> Totally understandable
[10:08:21] <isaacdurazo> we are very close and I really want to finish it
[10:08:25] <sfrisk> Life/work has a tendency of making us busy
[10:09:30] <marestad> Wah wah.
[10:09:41] <sfrisk> on the typography note, michaelarestad has been continuing work on the typography PR
[10:10:00] <sfrisk> if anyone has any comments on it, you can find it here: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/67
[10:10:20] <arthurvr> you mean https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/57 I guess?
[10:10:22] <marestad> Yep. Mostly picking fights with arschmitz on :focus.
[10:10:31] <arschmitz> lol
[10:10:34] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:10:39] <sfrisk> apparently I fail at linking to stuff
[10:10:47] <marestad> lol
[10:11:03] <geekman-rohit> thats the wrong PR
[10:11:05] <geekman-rohit> :D
[10:11:17] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/57 is the typography PR
[10:11:20] <marestad> I'm fully confident we'll tackle the focus issue along with adding more base type styles.
[10:12:04] <marestad> Upon reflection, I'm going to remove the removal of outline as well as base link styles.
[10:12:17] <marestad> Those should be defined at a component level.
[10:12:26] <sfrisk> Makes sense to me
[10:12:34] <marestad> Because arschmitz is right. Mostly.
[10:12:35] <arschmitz> marestad: my only concern is with accessability
[10:12:42] <arschmitz> lol
[10:12:43] <sfrisk> I can understand arschmitz's concern with accessibility
[10:12:50] <sfrisk> which he just typed
[10:13:01] <marestad> It's not a big deal with just the links, but when we start wrapping images in `a`, etc...
[10:13:10] <marestad> Not having the outline is bad.
[10:13:24] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:13:29] <arschmitz> marestad: even on links what if your tabing through links and using the keyboard
[10:13:43] <arschmitz> there should be a clear indication where you are in the document
[10:13:46] <sfrisk> Course you could have the project like the one I'm on, where they want outlines for buttons/regular inputs/etc
[10:13:52] <sfrisk> but HATED them on radio buttons
[10:14:01] <arschmitz> you might only be trying to get to a checkbox but its hard when you cant tell where you are on each tab
[10:14:08] <sfrisk> so there is literally no way of telling if you're focused on a radio button, because we were told to remove it
[10:14:17] <arschmitz> thats horrible
[10:14:28] <sfrisk> Oh, I fought it
[10:14:31] <sfrisk> I lost :-(
[10:14:37] <marestad> arschmitz: I agree about the links, but I have a better idea than stock outline for those. :)
[10:15:05] <arschmitz> marestad: like i said in my comment we do a different outline in mobile right now
[10:15:13] <marestad> Totally.
[10:15:15] <arschmitz> im not convinced its the best way but it does solve some problems
[10:15:29] <sfrisk> I agree it's something better handled at a component level
[10:15:44] <arschmitz> but seeing as i use it on the project im in charge of im obviously not totally against it lol
[10:16:31] <marestad> Cool. We'll figure it out.
[10:16:46] <noufal> Sfrisk: Is someone is working on form validation styling?
[10:17:03] <sfrisk> not yet, but that I feel is something that kinda needs typography in place first
[10:18:26] <sfrisk> we still need the SCSS style guide though
[10:19:42] <arschmitz> not only typography but its highly dependeany on form styles
[10:19:42] <noufal> Can I work on typography?
[10:19:50] <sfrisk> no, because marestad is working on that
[10:19:54] <sfrisk> there is a PR in place
[10:20:03] <noufal> oky
[10:20:08] <sfrisk> although, actually, I guess that's up to marestad
[10:20:10] <marestad> I mean you can. I can give you commit on my repo.
[10:20:13] <sfrisk> if he's got space to help
[10:20:37] <noufal> I can help. :)
[10:20:41] <sfrisk> you'll want to coordinate though, so you don't step on each other's shoes
[10:20:43] <marestad> noufal, ping me after and I'll add you. 8D
[10:20:59] <noufal> oky :)
[10:21:43] <sfrisk> once that lands though, we can start focusing on the other phase one stuff
[10:21:58] <noufal> marestad: can we have a small meeting after this one?
[10:22:27] <sfrisk> like buttons and other form elements, tables, form validation styling, etc
[10:22:43] <sfrisk> which we should be able to have a few different PRs going on at the same time
[10:22:55] <sfrisk> (yay for early awkward growing stages)
[10:24:40] <GreatDanton> it's bit hard to style buttons if colors are not defined
[10:24:52] <slayslot> sfrisk I didn't find HTML style guide in this weeks agenda
[10:25:14] <sfrisk> oops, my bad
[10:25:18] <noufal> but we can give user a choice to choice color.
[10:25:22] <sfrisk> today has been a bit hectic at work
[10:26:00] <sfrisk> looks like further discussion has been happening in the HTML style guide
[10:26:28] <slayslot> It's alright I thought maybe it wasn't a priority this week hence I asked :P
[10:26:58] <sfrisk> nope, it's on the list, I've been keeping up with the discussions
[10:27:00] <arschmitz> colors in some ways i would like to reflect the final logo color variations if it works out
[10:27:16] <arschmitz> the defaults
[10:27:25] <sfrisk> arschmitz - I agree with you there, I kinda want to see what isaacdurazo comes up with this week
[10:27:33] <sfrisk> and use those colors for the basic semantic colors on the site
[10:27:39] <arschmitz> yup
[10:27:46] <sfrisk> like that blue might be a good default button color / link color or something
[10:28:12] <arschmitz> or blue is a common active color
[10:28:21] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:30:23] <sfrisk> Also some further discussion has happened on Form Validation Styling
[10:30:57] <sfrisk> I'm going to update the first message in the issue to be a bit clearer, but I agree with marestad's idea of having at least two sets of error messaging components
[10:31:08] <sfrisk> one for the inputs, and another that is messaging related
[10:31:56] <arschmitz> yeah the plugin pointed to in the issue has two formats too
[10:32:02] <arschmitz> list at the top
[10:32:06] <arschmitz> or on each input
[10:32:06] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:32:29] <noufal> List at the top is better option.
[10:32:30] <sfrisk> Might put at the beginning of the issue a very clear definition of done for that Issue
[10:33:03] <sfrisk> I don't think we should force list at the top, or at each input, but allow for both
[10:33:16] <marestad> In-context notices are super important.
[10:33:33] <sfrisk> Especially since validation needs can vary project to project
[10:33:36] <marestad> At the top tends to lose and disconnect from the spot the issue takes place
[10:33:41] <marestad> Right.
[10:34:07] <sfrisk> Especially if you have a long form
[10:34:20] <arschmitz> we shoudl really look at that plugin
[10:34:27] <sfrisk> If you have to scroll up to find your validation message, that not a great user experience
[10:34:27] <arschmitz> its the most used form validation on the internet
[10:34:36] <noufal> yeah
[10:34:41] <sfrisk> I think I've used it for projects before actually
[10:34:44] <arschmitz> and its the #19 piece of JS on the internet
[10:35:12] <marestad> noufal: We can indeed have a short meeting after this one. (sorry for delay. In two meetings)
[10:35:23] <noufal> lol
[10:36:05] <noufal> Sfrish: We can check the size of form and than applay validation styling according to it?
[10:36:14] <noufal> apply*
[10:36:50] <marestad> Gotta think outside of conventional forms. Often, in web apps, form elements are in unique places by themselves, in modals, etc.
[10:37:26] <arschmitz> we are just providing styles
[10:37:30] <arschmitz> so we wont do anything
[10:37:35] <sfrisk> Well, we won't be doing the JS side of things
[10:37:39] <marestad> Yep.
[10:37:42] <sfrisk> that will be up to the developer to implement
[10:37:44] <arschmitz> we just provide the style and let people do with as they please
[10:38:06] <sfrisk> we'll give them the option to use either one, so the documentation for who to write it in your html, it's up to them to implement it
[10:38:29] <noufal> Marestad I develop a Web app for my start-up can u see the modal design ?
[10:39:43] <noufal> do you want to see the modal design?
[10:42:23] <ramasilveyra> Hello, sorry for being late.
[10:42:32] <sfrisk> Okay, so I think next priority is definitely finalizing the color definitions and setting up a PR for that
[10:42:33] <ramasilveyra> very late
[10:42:37] <sfrisk> even if it's just placeholder colors
[10:43:00] <marestad> Yep. I was actually going to use the colors in the last mockup of the blue logo.
[10:43:05] <sfrisk> also if anyone wants to work on the SCSS style guide - we do need  development on that
[10:43:09] <marestad> And create some semblance of a palette.
[10:43:16] <sfrisk> oo, sounds good marestad
[10:43:48] <sfrisk> I'm definitely interested in that sort of stuff too, so feel free to ping me about it
[10:44:13] <sfrisk> and Isaac is going to give us some use cases that work with that blue logo - so we should have some other "Official" colors for the pallet
[10:44:23] <slayslot> I'll try to add a list or something like I did with the HTML style guide
[10:44:32] <sfrisk> sounds good, slayslot
[10:44:42] <sfrisk> there should be a issue already created for scss style guide
[10:44:56] <slayslot> yes, I found it
[10:45:02] <sfrisk> also arschmitz was awesome this week, and updated naming convention, typography and grid system issues this week
[10:45:21] <sfrisk> to have a summary at the top of the page about where we currently are with discussions, since those issues were a bit long and complicated
[10:46:06] <marestad> Awesome.
[10:46:27] <sfrisk> especially naming conventions
[10:46:46] <marestad> Naming conventions is a beast.
[10:46:49] <sfrisk> yeahhhh
[10:46:54] <sfrisk> there were some feels in that one
[10:47:36] <sfrisk> as well as in icons
[10:48:14] <marestad> Related to icons a bit: http://slides.com/sarasoueidan/building-better-interfaces-with-svg#/
[10:48:36] <sfrisk> SVGs are awesome
[10:48:52] <marestad> :)
[10:49:00] <slayslot> true that
[10:49:06] <sfrisk> I think it will be cool to see what sort of animations we can do with the logo
[10:49:32] <marestad> :)
[10:50:27] <sfrisk> Also, GSoC students, as you may be aware, submissions ended on Friday, and we're in the process of picking what applications we can
[10:50:46] <noufal> oky :)
[10:51:16] <ramasilveyra> Okay thanks.
[10:51:16] <sfrisk> If we want further clarification on anything in your proposal, we'll leave a comment on your proposal
[10:52:09] <slayslot> sounds good
[10:53:07] <sfrisk> Okay, can anyone think of anything else they wanted to bring up?
[10:54:27] <sfrisk> Going once
[10:54:31] <sfrisk> Going Twice
[10:54:58] <noufal> I have some question about form validation styling
[10:54:58] <GreatDanton> mind explaining what are those numbers in there? http://slides.com/sarasoueidan/building-better-interfaces-with-svg#/19
[10:55:37] <sfrisk> noufal: what sort of questions?
[10:55:39] <arschmitz> GreatDanton: thats not something for the meeting
[10:55:43] <GreatDanton> ok
[10:56:28] <noufal> Some developer do validation from Controller how our stylling help them?
[10:57:03] <sfrisk> like a Controller in Angular.js?
[10:57:22] <noufal> Like MVC framework. Laravel
[10:57:26] <geekman-rohit> or a controller in server side?
[10:57:32] <noufal> yes
[10:57:41] <arschmitz> no matter how they do their validation server or client they still need mesages and styles
[10:57:50] <geekman-rohit> well? developer would render the message with our style
[10:57:59] <sfrisk> They would follow our standards for how to print out the validation
[10:58:16] <sfrisk> using the markup we give them to use
[10:58:23] <geekman-rohit> yes, what sfrisk said
[10:58:32] <noufal> It will be difficult for the
[10:59:08] <noufal> If user want validation at the top it is not the problem
[10:59:32] <geekman-rohit> does laravel autogenerate form markup?
[11:00:11] <noufal> If the develper want validation error next to the input field. it will case problem for the developer
[11:00:28] <noufal> yes laravel autogenrate a list for errors.
[11:01:06] <arschmitz> this really seems like something not for the meeting
[11:01:14] <sfrisk> Yeah, just what I was about to say
[11:01:14] <noufal> oky sorry :)
[11:01:16] <geekman-rohit> definitely
[11:01:20] <sfrisk> We can move it to css-chassis
[11:01:28] <geekman-rohit> noufal ping me later on this
[11:01:36] <noufal> oky sure
[11:01:37] <sfrisk> this is more of a discussion on how to get a server side language to implement Chassis, rather than Chassis itself
[11:02:00] <sfrisk> And on that note, I call this meeting to an end
