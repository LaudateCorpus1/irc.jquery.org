[09:01:04] <jzaefferer> ping DaveMethvin rwaldron johnbender Krinkle|detached gnarf
[09:01:20] <DaveMethvin> hey!
[09:01:42] <jzaefferer> I'm still not done with the 1.9.1 release.. would've missed this without Scott reminding me
[09:01:49] <jzaefferer> so tell me everything about your testing needs!
[09:02:28] <jzaefferer> no open PRs for QUnit
[09:02:41] <DaveMethvin> a release is a lot of work no matter how much you automate it, eh jzaefferer?
[09:03:07] <jzaefferer> a few issues, mostly feature ideas, half of them with inspiration from Yehuda
[09:03:16] <jzaefferer> if you have any input on them, please comment on the issues
[09:03:30] <jzaefferer> I haven't heard from Timo since the summit
[09:03:44] <jzaefferer> and as usual he's not around for this meeting, not sure why
[09:03:51] <DaveMethvin> in about a month we'll want to set up a 2.0 test without oldIE
[09:03:59] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle|detached was around last night
[09:04:12] <jzaefferer> that's a good point. I'll set up UI to test 1.10 without IE6 soon
[09:04:14] <DaveMethvin> so he's probably still sleeping
[09:04:29] <jzaefferer> I can just create another set for core 2.0 excluding 6, 7 and 8
[09:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> We also need UI 1-9-stable running in TestSwarm.
[09:04:35] <DaveMethvin> and we need to add Safari 6, IE10, etc
[09:04:52] <DaveMethvin> IE10 is officially out tomorrow
[09:05:02] <DaveMethvin> oh joy, another browser to test
[09:05:10] <jzaefferer> yay
[09:05:19] <DaveMethvin> otherwise, tho, nothing from me
[09:05:39] <jzaefferer> maybe I can catch timo later today
[09:06:01] <jzaefferer> maybe do a mini-dev-summit next month in the Netherlands, with Hans and Timo
[09:06:21] <jzaefferer> could get a lot done on the testing and accessibility fronts
[09:06:50] <DaveMethvin> we have budget for some travel
[09:07:28] <jzaefferer> if we can meet outside of amsterdam, travel costs should be really low, or if I can find a couch; hotels in Amsterdam are silly expensive
[09:07:50] <jzaefferer> just an idea for now, but maybe we can do that for real
[09:08:01] <jzaefferer> I'd certainly like to get more of Hans' attention on UI stuff
[09:08:24] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: any thoughts on this? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/332 - would you use that in core?
[09:09:08] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer:  i don't think we need it, we already fail in grunt on lint errors
[09:09:20] <DaveMethvin> and we just fail an assertion on file access
[09:09:23] <jzaefferer> I'll ask Timo for a TestSwarm update if I can find him later
[09:09:24] <DaveMethvin> which seems good enough
[09:09:37] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: okay, thanks
[09:09:50] <DaveMethvin> now finish up 1.9.1! :D
[11:00:51] <johnbender> I'm here!
[11:01:40] <gseguin> here
[11:01:40] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:46] <JasonDScott_> Here
[11:01:46] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:01:48] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:02:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Please check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5216
[11:02:04] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is jumping off
[11:02:25] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:02:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yes, I know ... running you down ... sorry!
[11:02:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... the deep end? Hope not :)
[11:02:45] <scottjehl__> hey
[11:03:03] <toddmparker> agenda here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ombrVLpvqUw7k3J_pdXY5Ou7GFP5xPmCcF7ukprljSg/edit#
[11:03:25] <toddmparker> we've got a lot of people so we can just hit highlights here to be discussed
[11:03:39] <toddmparker> people can read the doc or blog post after for the full rundown
[11:03:48] <toddmparker> DC summit was a great success
[11:04:04] <toddmparker> thanks to everyone for taking the time to make it a success
[11:04:14] <toddmparker> really nice to meet people in person
[11:04:53] <_|Nix|_> I've got four thumbs up (incl. big toes) :)
[11:05:07] <toddmparker> we had a bunch of new people stay with us after - looking at you arschmitz
[11:05:34] <toddmparker> ThemeRoller maintenance to transition from Tyler Benziger to Rafael Xavier int he coming weeks. Rafael will start work on porting TR over to Node.js so it can service both UI and Mobile
[11:05:41] <RWhitbeck> hi
[11:05:42] <toddmparker> Review NuGet PR: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/pull/114
[11:05:59] <toddmparker> and RWhitbeck will be helping us out on dev rel
[11:06:36] <toddmparker> or outreach? what's the right term RWhitbeck
[11:06:49] <RWhitbeck> dev rel is right
[11:06:52] <toddmparker> cool
[11:07:26] <toddmparker> so on that TR PR, AppendTo and MSFT were working making it easy to grab a custom theme via NuGet
[11:07:46] <toddmparker> we just need to figure out if/wen to pull this in and the support strategy
[11:08:00] <toddmparker> I'd prefer to have AppendTo take that on if we add this
[11:08:25] <toddmparker> any opinions?
[11:08:42] <RWhitbeck> I can talk with appendTo more on that.  I think that sounds fine though.
[11:09:29] <toddmparker> ok, let's jast keep talking about this
[11:09:38] <toddmparker> just popped up on my radar recently
[11:09:53] <toddmparker> Work has started on 1.3 features for responsive design features
[11:10:01] <RWhitbeck> I heard about it last month then I lost track of it.
[11:10:05] <toddmparker> scottjehl__ has been working with me on the RWD tables
[11:10:22] <toddmparker> prototyping two modes: column chooser and stack to label/value pairs at narrow widths.
[11:10:29] <toddmparker> demo: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html
[11:11:03] <toddmparker> stack w/more customs styles - http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/stack-custom.html
[11:11:14] <toddmparker> both modes are functional
[11:11:45] <scottjehl__> testing out well too: I'm working on that now
[11:11:52] <toddmparker> scottjehl__: just realized I stole your thunder
[11:11:56] <toddmparker> :)
[11:12:07] <scottjehl__> all yours
[11:12:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I did
[11:12:57] <RWhitbeck> ooh that stack column is nice
[11:13:01] <toddmparker> One big theme that scottjehl__ Wilto and I keep circling around re: RWD
[11:13:09] <toddmparker> Baking CSS media queries (breakpoints) into our structure CSS will cause a lot of maintenance issues and prevent easy customization. We’re leaning towards providing copy/paste styles for common scenarios in demos and docs but not shipping this CSS as part of the library because these must be tuned to the content/layout/design of each site. Focus on education and demos.
[11:13:10] <gseguin> both are really neat
[11:13:27] <toddmparker> yeah, think we'll be the first library to offer some easy solutions
[11:13:36] <toddmparker> yeah, they serve different needs
[11:13:50] <arschmitz> I really like the second one for phones
[11:13:58] <RWhitbeck> toddmparker sounds like good conent for learn.jquery.co
[11:13:59] <toddmparker> the col chooser mode is good for data that needs to be compared across rows/columns, like financials
[11:14:00] <RWhitbeck> m
[11:14:28] <toddmparker> the stack is better for stuff that doesn't need as much comparison - contact lists, movies, etc.
[11:14:37] <scottjehl__> also one of the bigger issues is it's not possible to provide media query breakpoints that work for different sites/content
[11:14:46] <toddmparker> both are very lightweight and built on a tiny table core
[11:14:56] <toddmparker> right.
[11:14:58] <Wilto> Right. We’d either just be making them up, or making decisions based on common screen sizes.
[11:15:08] <Wilto> Neither of which is especially Okay To Do.
[11:15:11] <toddmparker> Simple example: if a site has a left nav that is 300px wide, our breakpoints won’t make sense because they would have been written with a full-width layout.
[11:15:16] <scottjehl__> (re: not shipping media queries)
[11:15:34] <toddmparker> so that's the tricky education part on all RWD stuff
[11:15:50] <Wilto> I’ll be traveling the world giving lectures, as part of this initiative.
[11:15:53] <toddmparker> we will include lots of demos and cop/paste examples but shipping media queries in structure.css is a bad idea
[11:16:04] <Wilto> By “giving lectures,” I mean “making threats.”
[11:16:15] <toddmparker> so we'll need to do a lot of education with this
[11:16:26] <arschmitz> i fully agree shipping media queries is bad and dosent make sense
[11:16:31] <_|Nix|_> We should get accredited.
[11:16:44] <uGoMobi> +1 to the showing howto instead of including it approach
[11:16:53] <scottjehl__> so the goal is to build our widgets so that breakpoint toggles can be made in the fewest lines of css possible
[11:16:55] <toddmparker> we can, for example, include a small chunk of "default" MQ styles in the table API docs that people can drop into their stylesheets, but it won't be in the CSS download
[11:17:19] <toddmparker> yeah, anyone who actually writes MQs gets who bad an idea it is
[11:17:44] <toddmparker> ^^ sorry for the terrible Engrish
[11:18:00] <uGoMobi> I understand your Engrish
[11:18:01] <scottjehl__> for example, a full breakpoint could be:
[11:18:20] <scottjehl__> @media screen and (min-width: 20em) {
[11:18:20] <scottjehl__>    th.ui-table-priority-1,
[11:18:20] <scottjehl__>    td.ui-table-priority-1 {
[11:18:20] <scottjehl__>      display: table-cell;
[11:18:20] <scottjehl__>    }
[11:18:21] <scottjehl__> }
[11:18:40] <arschmitz> speaking of demos though i think we need to think about a scheme for where to put them all i think there are some that make sense linked from a widget or section but then some that are more general
[11:19:20] <toddmparker> arschmitz: agreed…think uGoMobi has been looking at that...
[11:19:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I suggest to not categorize based on widgets
[11:19:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I did :)
[11:19:43] <johnbender> scottjehl__: toddmparker: if you guys want to build this out as a separate project/repo you might consider parameterizing the mq's with sass or some simple interpolation and a build scrip
[11:19:47] <johnbender> thoughts
[11:20:05] <johnbender> I had one
[11:20:21] <toddmparker> johnbender: I did want to discuss where "demos" should live
[11:20:26] <arschmitz> that was my thought as well to not go based on widget's and maybe add a demos section
[11:20:39] <toddmparker> most of the current docs & demos will move to api.jquerymobile.com
[11:20:46] <scottjehl__> johnbender we were thinking of just demonstrating how to write them but leaving it to authors
[11:21:08] <toddmparker> and we're going to create a new set of kitchen sink & real-world demos that show off how to customize, extend and use the library
[11:21:20] <uGoMobi> because I see demos as a test suite as well I thought it might be useful to keep them in main repo so you can test when working in a branch
[11:21:23] <arschmitz> only thing with a sepearate repo is as uGoMobi mentioned the other day they could be good for testing
[11:21:26] <johnbender> scottjehl__: cool, I don't really know whether it's possible to parameterize the mq's in a sane way
[11:21:28] <toddmparker> so…should those demos just be a separate repo altogether?
[11:21:29] <_|Nix|_> There's gonna be a lot of "keep resizing the window and when it starts looking bad, jot down the width".
[11:21:33] <scottjehl__> more likely to be useful that way, I think.
[11:21:34] <johnbender> assuming it's not then education is really the only way
[11:21:43] <toddmparker> and we'd just pull a copy in when we do a build for a release?
[11:21:58] <toddmparker> i can see the testing argument
[11:22:08] <johnbender> if it is, making it stupid easy is one way to increase uptake
[11:22:25] <johnbender> which I presume is important to the Responsivistas like you guys :)
[11:22:33] <_|Nix|_> I think it should be the other way. The demos should pull in a version of jqm, not the other way around.
[11:22:34] <toddmparker> johnbender: ok, so leaving in the current repo seems like the plan
[11:23:03] <scottjehl__> time to encourage more custom app appearances though. too many apps that look like a colored version of jqm docs
[11:23:12] <johnbender> responsivistasⒸ
[11:23:14] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: seems like people like having the demos for testing
[11:23:21] <arschmitz> ^^ +++
[11:23:26] <agcolom> Hi, finally managed to connect!
[11:23:28] <Wilto> I have been known to responsivize every now and again.
[11:23:41] <toddmparker> think we just need to give more examples to show how to customize, really push people
[11:23:42] <johnbender> toddmparker: the demos?
[11:23:47] <johnbender> sure
[11:23:53] <johnbender> we can pull them out later when you guys want
[11:24:10] <johnbender> but we should aim to do that at some point
[11:24:10] <toddmparker> johnbender: i'm fine leaving demos in the same repo
[11:24:20] <johnbender> kk
[11:24:30] <johnbender> either way really
[11:24:32] <_|Nix|_> A crazy thought: Let's make all the demos in jsbin ...
[11:24:36] * _|Nix|_ ducks under a rock
[11:24:42] <toddmparker> the only reason for separate repo is for us to be able to track demo issues separate from the lib
[11:25:01] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: that is a cool idea
[11:25:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: there's also the social aspect of maintaining the demos
[11:25:13] <johnbender> people expect them to work as the library gets updated
[11:25:15] <toddmparker> wish you could edit a version w/o changing the URL
[11:25:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, then people can just append "edit" to the URL and copy.
[11:25:21] <johnbender> but when we update the library no one thinks about the demos really
[11:25:26] <uGoMobi> and without having iframe issues
[11:25:33] <toddmparker> frames are bad
[11:25:47] <johnbender> we had a directory labeled experiments that people were filing issues against
[11:25:50] <johnbender> _experiments_
[11:25:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I believe you can edit without changing the URL, as long as noone else has done that.
[11:26:06] <toddmparker> Making it easy to view source is important for the new demos for sure
[11:26:09] <johnbender> which implies "not supported"
[11:26:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but you're right. URLs do tend to change a lot.
[11:26:24] <uGoMobi> another reason to keep demos in the main repo is that we can close issues by adding a demo
[11:26:26] <toddmparker> Idea: have a button to open in jsbin and it would somehow create a jsbin with the code
[11:26:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: true
[11:26:39] <arschmitz> and i dont know about anyone else but i have trouble on jsbin with my ios devices a lot where it wont finish loading!
[11:26:49] <_|Nix|_> This needs server-side scripting.
[11:27:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I noticed that too
[11:27:05] <_|Nix|_> is jsbin itself available as a package?
[11:27:11] <toddmparker> all those kind of tools add jankiness because of their own overhead. it's not a "pure" page
[11:27:20] <scottjehl__> agreed.
[11:27:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I agree, but then we have to support it
[11:27:28] <johnbender> as in keep the demo up to date
[11:27:36] <johnbender> which isn't the primary purpose of the repo
[11:27:55] <johnbender> if it's separate we can at least associate it with a version of the library known to work with all the demos
[11:28:10] <toddmparker> I think this hits at the heart of the matter. What are we committing to with these demos in terms of maintenance?
[11:28:21] <johnbender> ^^
[11:28:22] <scottjehl__> are the new docs going to have examples of every variation?
[11:28:40] <toddmparker> I think we should have an area with lots of widget variations
[11:28:51] <_|Nix|_> I found https://github.com/remy/jsbin ... is that a fork of the upstream jsbin, or is that the real jsbin?
[11:29:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi keep whipping up test pages but I'd like to have a gallery of most every permutation so I can browse, copy and paste
[11:29:09] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: the real one
[11:29:22] <gseguin> remy is the author
[11:29:25] <toddmparker> we could talk to Remy
[11:29:40] <toddmparker> he did a bunch of work to improve mobile on jsbin
[11:30:03] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: maybe you can review where you are w/docs stuff
[11:30:15] <scottjehl__> isn't jsbin inaccessible in some devices?
[11:30:33] <scottjehl__> I worry this adds a layer that'll break our support claims
[11:30:37] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, then we could build our demos using this, and make them read-only.
[11:30:38] <toddmparker> I'd imagine there would be issues with the JS and iframes
[11:30:45] <uGoMobi> I agree with scottjehl__
[11:31:22] <toddmparker> thinking we could have "pure" static demo page with a button to view source to start
[11:31:29] <toddmparker> KISS
[11:31:35] <uGoMobi> +1
[11:31:42] <gseguin> +1
[11:31:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: What shall power that button?
[11:31:48] <toddmparker> (sorry I called everyone stupid)
[11:31:57] <toddmparker> * magic *
[11:32:00] <agcolom> +1
[11:32:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking into that magic
[11:32:36] <agcolom> there is something in jqueryui.com
[11:32:42] <uGoMobi> JS to copy the code and a regex to prevent the html from being rendered
[11:32:47] <toddmparker> We could wrap each example in a container and write a script to find each demo container, append a button and show a popup with the code escaped
[11:32:50] <agcolom> (view source), but we can make our own...
[11:33:05] <gseguin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-source_URI_scheme
[11:33:13] <agcolom> are we talking api docs or current docs?
[11:33:48] <uGoMobi> current docs that will be renewed when we have separate API docs
[11:33:51] <gseguin> current docs
[11:33:53] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: but is that supported across the board?
[11:34:07] <toddmparker> At the point where the API docs launch, the current docs need to switch over to a new purpose = demos and tutorials on how to customize/extend
[11:34:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ so close :( but no
[11:34:29] <toddmparker> I don't' want to repeat content from the API docs there, we'll jus link over
[11:34:31] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: not on IE nor Opera
[11:34:45] <uGoMobi> see agenda for structure that I suggest
[11:34:49] <arschmitz> or safari
[11:34:51] <scottjehl__> I think we'd want to grab pre-enhanced fragments, not the whole page
[11:35:01] <toddmparker> think there are two use cases: 1. view source of the whole page 2. view source of a snippet
[11:35:05] <toddmparker> both are valid.
[11:35:20] <toddmparker> that seems to cover #1, at least partially
[11:35:57] <arschmitz> for viewsource just a thought its easy server side to pick up a flag and send a text file vs html which = viewsource
[11:36:39] <toddmparker> arschmitz: one thought is these docs are packaged with the zip
[11:36:46] <toddmparker> so server-side can be a problem
[11:36:52] <gseguin> arschmitz: it'd be great if we had no dep on the serverside
[11:36:54] <scottjehl__> We could just get documentElement.innerHTML at domready
[11:37:08] <scottjehl__> open it in an overlay or whatever. with formatting
[11:37:14] <toddmparker> yeah, then just escape entities
[11:37:23] <toddmparker> that's what I was thinking too
[11:37:30] <gseguin> that sounds very doable
[11:37:34] <_|Nix|_> What about the js bits?
[11:37:42] <scottjehl__> prism.js is good for the highlighting
[11:37:56] <arschmitz> yeah that sounds better
[11:37:58] <scottjehl__> I've used it a lot
[11:38:00] <agcolom> if you are talking about the api docs, each example is a separate html file
[11:38:19] <toddmparker> agcolom: I see
[11:38:23] <uGoMobi> prism.js looks good... will try that out
[11:38:52] <agcolom> and each example appears in its own iframe
[11:39:05] <_|Nix|_> I suppose if we wrote the js for each example in a script tag next to the example, it would be easy to display.
[11:39:08] <toddmparker> for the demos, I'd like to have some pages be a collection of common variations of a widget
[11:39:09] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/radiobuttons/
[11:39:23] <toddmparker> ^^ like that, w/o most of the narrative
[11:39:51] <toddmparker> I'd want to view the source for just the 2nd radio example quickly. Tap a link/button, copy > paste
[11:40:31] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yep. we could wrap html, css, js together in one container so you could view source
[11:41:09] <_|Nix|_> <div data-role="example"><script>...</script><style>...</style><div>...</div></div>
[11:41:10] <uGoMobi> and disable Ajax nav
[11:41:15] <toddmparker> if the script was dumb, we could wrap a style block with custom styles in one of these view source wrappers and the button to view source would appear
[11:41:28] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yep
[11:41:54] <toddmparker> sounds like uGoMobi is already looking at this utility
[11:41:56] <agcolom> would that be for the new docs?
[11:42:01] <toddmparker> agcolom: yes
[11:42:11] <_|Nix|_> We could event be sneaky and disable AJAX in the actual DOM, but when someone clicks view source, we'd strip that stuff out before displaying it.
[11:42:12] <toddmparker> none of this will affect what you've done
[11:42:19] <scottjehl__> so these pages will all use data-ajax=false right
[11:42:19] <agcolom> ok
[11:42:29] <uGoMobi> scottjehl__: yes
[11:42:37] <toddmparker> I'd imagine so
[11:42:42] <scottjehl__> will there be transitions demos?
[11:42:47] <scottjehl__> because uh
[11:42:54] <toddmparker> there should be, yes
[11:43:08] <arschmitz> sounds like this will be super slick for the casual copy and paste user
[11:43:16] <toddmparker> well, not all pages would need data-ajax=false
[11:43:17] <_|Nix|_> scottjehl__: Smells like iframe at that point.
[11:43:41] <toddmparker> think we just need to bang out some demos
[11:44:14] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that's the goal - make it easy to build cool stuff, but teach them how to do things like override CSS, tweak JS config, write media queries
[11:44:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, I dunno how we could illustrate examples that require one to hook up to "mobileinit" ...
[11:45:07] <toddmparker> for those, we'd need to do a reload
[11:45:33] <arschmitz> I Like it! make it so easy people would be crazy not to use it!
[11:45:40] <toddmparker> yep
[11:45:53] <toddmparker> I see us having more "collection" pages like this: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[11:46:04] <toddmparker> for the pitch sink part of this
[11:46:09] <toddmparker> kitchen sink
[11:46:29] <toddmparker> right now, you need to navigate around a lot to see all the variety
[11:47:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, there is /a lot/ in there so you need to strike a balance between navigation and overwhelming the user with a heavy page.
[11:47:59] <toddmparker> true, true
[11:48:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Not to mention for performance reasons.
[11:48:27] <toddmparker> be cool to have that form page with some controls to set the theme, switch to mini, hide labels, etc.
[11:48:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We don't wanna give the impression that jqm performs poorly, because we have loaded the page with lots of gizmos.
[11:48:51] <toddmparker> sure
[11:49:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Do I smell on-the-fly options? No, no I don't. Just .remove() and re-create.
[11:49:11] <toddmparker> but i know that form page is my workhorse for testing
[11:49:21] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: maybe that for now :)
[11:49:46] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:49:52] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: do you have all your test pages handy?
[11:50:09] <toddmparker> might be good to start throwing those into that branch
[11:50:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: most of them
[11:50:19] <_|Nix|_> We should also ask MauriceG ... he's made a lot!
[11:50:29] <toddmparker> we could have a diagnostics area which is where we have these crazy test pages
[11:50:32] <toddmparker> ok
[11:50:47] <_|Nix|_> Maybe we should also scan the closed tickets for jsbins ...
[11:51:10] <toddmparker> yeah, some might also make good demos
[11:51:16] <arschmitz> that will be an amazing amount of jsbins!!!
[11:51:21] <toddmparker> yep
[11:51:34] <_|Nix|_> Funny thing is, if some random person submits a jsbin, do we have their permission to use it like this?
[11:51:36] <toddmparker> nice thing is we just need to start by paring down what we have
[11:51:45] <toddmparker> and can then add stuff as we see a demand
[11:52:11] <toddmparker> the vast majority of docs pages will need to be culled when the API docs go live
[11:52:28] <uGoMobi> that's why I suggest not to categorize demos but put them all on a list with a filter
[11:52:43] <toddmparker> agcolom: would there be a place in the API docs for the data- reference?
[11:52:45] <uGoMobi> because the amount of examples that is ^^
[11:52:49] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, we mostly just need docs/*/index.html ...
[11:53:04] <_|Nix|_> None of the events.html, methods.html, options.html ...
[11:53:09] <toddmparker> all gone
[11:53:53] <toddmparker> this has been a good conversation, seems like we're in general agreement on the plan
[11:54:12] <toddmparker> anyone have items they'd like to discuss in the last few minutes?
[11:54:33] <uGoMobi> I will continue to work on this so you can see the results next week
[11:55:08] <_|Nix|_> ... and I've got retina jitters to fix, although I'm looking forward to hitting the big green button on the form reset PR.
[11:55:23] <toddmparker> BTW - the Google doc with our "key activities" for the week is now 4 pages long. Dang.
[11:55:34] <uGoMobi> I have nothing that can't wait until next weeks meeting
[11:55:39] <toddmparker> Ah, form reset
[11:55:59] <toddmparker> What's the status on that one? There was a fair amount of iteration there.
[11:56:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah ... should be "In the pipe - five by five".
[11:56:40] <kpepin> toddmparker:  Only thing I've got is a minor update on the listview-grid...
[11:56:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can we test that?
[11:56:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We should probably cherry-pick that all the way to 1.1, or not?
[11:56:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think we can.
[11:57:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But that's a hell of a lot of work.
[11:57:20] <gseguin> We need to release 1.1.2 to be done with 1.1-stable
[11:57:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you could just mock the prototype `refresh` and check that it's called
[11:57:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can we close the other 2 PR's ?
[11:57:39] <johnbender> err
[11:57:40] <johnbender> stub it
[11:58:10] <toddmparker> Yeah, getting some test coverage there is important
[11:58:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno ... I also wanna make sure that refresh does the right thing.
[11:58:54] <toddmparker> gseguin: let's take a look and see if there is anything critical we'd want to get into 1.1.2 and get that shipped soon
[11:59:02] <toddmparker> need help making a changelog
[11:59:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, so no form reset cherry-picking?
[11:59:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: for 1.1-stable?
[11:59:44] <toddmparker> depends on how we feel about those changes
[11:59:53] <_|Nix|_> Gang? ^^^
[12:00:03] <uGoMobi> talking about branches... shall we clean up branches? Basecamp post so we can comment what branches shouldn't be deleted?
[12:00:14] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good idea
[12:00:16] <gseguin> well the thing is if we release 1.1.2 then we can just say we stop maintaining 1.1-stable
[12:00:18] <toddmparker> there are a ton
[12:00:26] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/
[12:00:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: testing refresh and testing that _reset calls refresh are two different things
[12:00:42] <gseguin> whereas if we don't then as a user I would expect to get that bug fix in the next patch release
[12:01:00] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:01:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: definitely to 1.2 stable, I don't think that 1.1 is that important but thats my 2c
[12:01:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'd want to take the hands-off approach: trigger the "reset" event on the form, and see that, for example, no checkbutton is checked.
[12:01:25] <toddmparker> that's where I'm leaning
[12:01:41] <toddmparker> I'd hate to introduce a regression on the last maintenance release for 1.1.x
[12:01:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and when I say that, I mean look at the classes we add to the buttonMarkup and all that, not the input.
[12:02:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The input will obviously be correct.
[12:02:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, like, no ui-btn-active in any of the divs, etc.
[12:02:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: alright, up to you
[12:02:38] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ and johnbender - can you guys huddle on tests and final review for the reset form stuff after the meeting? Seems like it would be good to have you hash it out
[12:02:43] <johnbender> but it sounds like you've got a good idea of what to test
[12:02:46] <gseguin> toddmparker: that's why I would cut 1.1.2 and be done with it
[12:02:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: I think we just did :)
[12:03:01] <toddmparker> johnbender: cool
[12:03:04] <johnbender> toddmparker: I agree with gseguin
[12:03:05] <toddmparker> gseguin: agreed
[12:03:08] <_|Nix|_> One more thing:
[12:03:24] <_|Nix|_> Land this thing only when the tests are in place, or land it and then work on the tests?
[12:03:36] <_|Nix|_> Which way shall I go?
[12:03:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: land it and then test
[12:03:54] <johnbender> not perfect but nothing ever is :)
[12:03:54] <_|Nix|_> WORKSFORME.
[12:04:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, manual tests pass, at any rate *shrug*
[12:04:13] <gseguin> gotta bail, see you guys in -dev to release 1.1.2
[12:04:21] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[12:05:26] <toddmparker> cool
[12:05:29] <toddmparker> thanks all!
[12:05:31] <toddmparker> wrapping up
[13:02:15] <agcolom> .
[13:02:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! I think we need to close the channel...
[13:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> SILENCE!
