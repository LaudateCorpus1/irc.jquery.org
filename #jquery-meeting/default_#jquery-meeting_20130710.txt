[09:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov rxaviers rxaviers_
[09:01:43] <kborchers> hey
[09:02:34] <rxaviers_> hello
[09:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like a small turnout today.
[09:03:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: here
[09:03:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: though bout to step afk for a bit
[09:03:58] <tj_vantoll_phone> On phone but here.
[09:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> So, a bunch of us had a meeting to discuss AMD/UMD.
[09:04:17] <scott_gonzalez> And we figured out what we're doing for all projects.
[09:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> UI and Mobile will use the jqueryPlugin implementation.
[09:04:34] <scott_gonzalez>  https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/jqueryPlugin.js
[09:05:38] <kborchers> seems good
[09:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> We're not concerned with doing anything specific for node or CommonJS support.
[09:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> Unlike core and QUnit.
[09:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> Which make sense to use in those contexts.
[09:06:20] <kborchers> makes sense
[09:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> For Bower, we're just going to ship the source files with @VERSION replaced.
[09:06:55] <tj_vantoll_phone> Sounds good to me.
[09:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> It will be up to the user to handle concat and minification.
[09:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> Either through a custom script or r.js since we'll now have AMD.
[09:07:20] <kborchers> yeah, that sounds like the only sane solution for bower
[09:07:55] <rxaviers_> did you have a change to talk to dan about bower's registries?
[09:08:01] <rxaviers_> change/chance
[09:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> not yet
[09:08:20] <fnagel> Sorry, Im late#
[09:08:35] <rxaviers_> when are going to add AMD wrappers to the projects?
[09:08:38] <tj_vantoll_phone> If you're using Bower you almost certainly have a concat and minify setup.
[09:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> no problem fnagel
[09:08:56] <kborchers> tj_vantoll_phone: yep
[09:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> We can do it immeditaely, assuming download builder can handle it.
[09:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only thing that will really hold this up.
[09:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> But we can create a branch today, and land it when download builder is ready for it.
[09:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get it into 1.11.
[09:10:01] <rxaviers_> ok I will check and list potential difficulties
[09:10:18] <rxaviers_> and make DB support it
[09:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks rxaviers_
[09:11:17] <rxaviers_> by the way, these (AMD and bower stuff) are really awesome updates :)
[09:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers_: Want to give a general update for download builder?
[09:12:37] <rxaviers_> sure, there's no much updates, but reviewing 1.11 support
[09:13:03] <rxaviers_> Last week, I've focuses on Globalize vs. CLDR
[09:13:04] <rxaviers_> focused*
[09:13:09] <mikesherov> hi
[09:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right. Let's give an overview of that
[09:14:48] <rxaviers_> sure
[09:15:19] <rxaviers_> the first two things I wanted to make sure we're good with CLDR was languages and content coverage.
[09:15:39] <rxaviers_> since we're good with CLDR language's coverage, I've mapped content.
[09:16:12] <rxaviers_> as far as I saw, most of the localize fields we use have straightforward mappings
[09:16:48] <rxaviers_> Although, there are two areas that are very different
[09:17:49] <rxaviers_> I would like to know what do we do with that.
[09:17:55] <rxaviers_> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/128#issuecomment-20612730
[09:18:07] <rxaviers_> Basically, it's Currency and Calendar
[09:18:35] <rxaviers_> The way CLDR defines those are different from the way Globalize does.
[09:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll need a discussion around that. I'm not sure what we should do here, but it definitely seems like Globalize was just missing necessary data.
[09:20:42] <rxaviers_> Ok, it's important to decide what we want to do with those before going into technical things like JSON tools, how to import those, etc.
[09:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeha
[09:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> *yeah
[09:21:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well now that you've started looking into this and tj_vantoll_phone is working on datepicker, we should really focus on this.
[09:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> So let's try to find some time for a discussion when jzaefferer is around.
[09:21:48] <rxaviers_> cool. ok
[09:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can rope SlexAxton in too.
[09:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Want to give an update on selectmenu?
[09:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not :-P
[09:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I believe he has made updates for all issues that have been pointed out so far.
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> So that means we're ready for the next round of review.
[09:26:36] <scott_gonzalez> After which, selectmenu will hopefully land in master :-)
[09:27:37] <tj_vantoll_phone> Excellent
[09:27:54] <fnagel> Sorry, too much workload
[09:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, anything else to add about selectmenu?
[09:28:41] <fnagel> Right, no open points atm. I will review jquery mobile select next days
[09:29:42] <fnagel> Please note I've opened another PR as requested by JÃ¶rn
[09:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> Great. I'll wait for that before the next review. In case we decide to make any big changes based on mobile.
[09:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Anything you want to discuss about the effects rewrite or anything else?
[09:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> I know you're waiting on feedback from the PR.
[09:31:50] <arschmitz> fnagel: if you have any questions related to mobile one feel free to ping me
[09:31:56] <fnagel> I dont think so, I took a quick look on the source of mobile and it seems we will run into a11y issues while merging.
[09:31:59] <fnagel> arschmitz: did you do any a11y testing?
[09:32:25] <arschmitz> fnagel: to be honest it was written before i was on the project so im not sure how much they did i know there was some but....
[09:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:34:28] <fnagel> arschmitz: so no a11y ;-) It was really hard to have working screenreader support across the OS and browser in UI selectmenu. Anyway, we will know more when I start to take a more detailed look at it,
[09:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, as a wrap up, I'll just mention that arschmitz and I have been making good progress with getting Mobile and UI closer to a merge point.
[09:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> $.mobile.widget is no longer its own base widget.
[09:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile just modifying $.Widget to have the functioanlity Mobile needs.
[09:40:18] <scott_gonzalez> We're working through some other changes as well to make it so you can just drop in 3rd party widgets and have them work.
[09:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> The first test is being able to completely remove this file: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/tabs.js
[09:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> And just use ui.tabs directly.
[09:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> Let's continue any other discussion in -dev.
[09:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
