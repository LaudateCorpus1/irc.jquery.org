[09:02:22] <jzaefferer> Let's see who's around
[09:02:27] <fnagel> hey
[09:02:36] <rxaviers> hello jzaefferer
[09:02:49] <jzaefferer> arschmitz:  fnagel gnarf kborchers mikesherov rxaviers uGoMobi
[09:03:01] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:08] <jzaefferer> Guess I could've skipped you two :-)
[09:04:09] <jzaefferer> I edited some of the agenda, some items still have the text from last week
[09:04:35] <jzaefferer> Last week TJ said he put the two autocomplete issues with lots of duplicates on his list, but I don't think he's done anything about those yet
[09:04:52] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: button?
[09:05:06] <arschmitz> Did a lot of updates on the wiki
[09:05:20] <arschmitz> and i have a few questions for discussion
[09:05:29] <jzaefferer> Right. Still have the tab open to review the checkboxradio stuff
[09:06:00] <arschmitz> one being if we should support hidden elements in controlgroups / buttonsets
[09:06:47] <arschmitz> we do in mobile but im not sure its needed
[09:06:50] <jzaefferer> I guess that issue never popped up in UI where buttonset is only for buttons, while controlgroup is more generic so more likely to contain hidden elements
[09:07:15] <jzaefferer> It seems easy enough to support and doesn't really need an option. Just call refresh when you toggle something
[09:07:34] <arschmitz> yeah just then you need to do :visible
[09:07:40] <arschmitz> which is super slow
[09:08:16] <arschmitz> but yes its easy to do and does not require an option
[09:08:39] <jzaefferer> Works for me
[09:08:57] <jzaefferer> If its too slow, use CSS only controlgroups?
[09:09:05] <arschmitz> true
[09:09:14] <arschmitz> so i guess speed in controlgroup is not a real issue
[09:09:18] <jzaefferer> Right
[09:09:33] <arschmitz> ok that works for me and its simple
[09:09:34] <jzaefferer> Can you update that accordingly? If no one complains, go ahead and implement it like that.
[09:09:38] <arschmitz> sure
[09:09:45] <jzaefferer> Though either way, removing the :visible check should be trivial, too
[09:09:56] <arschmitz> yup
[09:10:11] <jzaefferer> I guess the other question is "should we support textinputs and selectmenus"?
[09:10:17] <arschmitz> yup
[09:10:54] <jzaefferer> What does that involve, besides extending the items selector?
[09:10:56] <arschmitz> in mobile we currently support selectmenus but not textinputs
[09:11:24] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: maybe a couple trivial rules borders or something other then that not much
[09:11:45] <arschmitz> css rules that is of course
[09:12:10] <jzaefferer> sounds fine to me
[09:12:14] <arschmitz> ok
[09:12:20] <arschmitz> and here is a bigger question
[09:12:48] <arschmitz> in mobile we use .ui-btn our equivalent of .ui-button all over the place
[09:13:09] <arschmitz> so for example any button like widget uses it
[09:13:25] <arschmitz> so it becomes more a part of core css then button specific
[09:13:45] <arschmitz> all the button rules really
[09:14:17] <arschmitz> so that in something like controlgroup you dont need to make seperate rules for each widget type
[09:14:43] <jzaefferer> so in mobile you have .ui-btn in the theme, like you're adding .ui-button now?
[09:14:53] <arschmitz> yes
[09:15:28] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:15:42] <arschmitz> there is still a button css file too but its basicly always included
[09:15:49] <arschmitz> almost part of core
[09:15:52] <jzaefferer> that goes a bit outside the scope of controlgroup and touches too much css framework issue for my taste
[09:16:24] <jzaefferer> would be good to figure that out, but I don't have an answer for that
[09:16:29] <arschmitz> its not really just about controlgroup
[09:16:34] <jzaefferer> sure
[09:16:39] <jzaefferer> but css frameworky, right?
[09:16:42] <arschmitz> for example it would make it so you dont need ui-selectmenu-button class
[09:17:18] <arschmitz> kinda execpt since button and controlgroup and checkbox all would be effected by this it might make sense to decide on how to handle meantime
[09:17:26] <jzaefferer> I guess uGoMobi isn't around?
[09:17:44] <arschmitz> i have not seen him yet today
[09:17:47] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:17:56] <jzaefferer> Let's discuss that with him when he's around
[09:18:03] <arschmitz> yeah and scott too
[09:18:16] <jzaefferer> Yeah, Scott loves CSS discussions as much as AMD discussions :p
[09:18:17] <arschmitz> i just wanted to bring it up so we could start thinking about it
[09:18:53] <rxaviers> lol - "Scott loves CSS discussions as much as AMD discussion"
[09:19:06] <jzaefferer> did we decide anything on focus styling and anchor support?
[09:19:17] <arschmitz> anchor i think we are going to support
[09:19:41] <arschmitz> focus it was left at ask chris coyier
[09:19:51] <jzaefferer> Could you do that?
[09:20:05] <arschmitz> sure
[09:22:24] <jzaefferer> Okay, updated the agenda accordingly
[09:22:29] <jzaefferer> Anything else on button?
[09:22:38] <jzaefferer> Otherwise, rxaviers, what's going on with Globalize?
[09:22:46] <arschmitz> nope thats it for this week
[09:23:00] <arschmitz> just finishing overhauling the tests
[09:23:04] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: let me know when I should do another review
[09:23:13] <arschmitz> will do
[09:23:38] <rxaviers> Pluralization https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/220 is implemented, unit tests done, build done, needs to figure out the legal thing, and finish functional tests, and adjust documentation.
[09:24:08] <rxaviers> Documentation #224 has landed
[09:24:27] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: about plurals
[09:24:45] <jzaefferer> what did you implement and how does that, or doesn't, overlap with CLDRPluralRuleParser?
[09:25:14] <rxaviers> What I meant with implementation is basically wrapper
[09:25:21] <rxaviers> very slim thing
[09:25:41] <jzaefferer> What does "done" mean then?
[09:26:13] <rxaviers> unit tests and build done?
[09:26:15] <jzaefferer> in master? In a branch? If branch, could you do a PR?
[09:26:42] <jzaefferer> ah, there: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/compare/plural
[09:26:46] <rxaviers> pardon, plural branch
[09:26:47] <rxaviers> yes
[09:26:59] <rxaviers> I will include that in the description, or create a PR
[09:28:35] <jzaefferer> the naming is confusing, too. It formats a number into the locale specific plural word, right? Like formatNumberAsWord?
[09:28:58] <jzaefferer> CLDRPluralRuleParser involves parsing, the demo says "evaulate", all kinda confusing
[09:29:30] <jzaefferer> anyway, a PR would be good
[09:29:39] <rxaviers> The plural function returns the plural-form of a number/decimal value based on the chosen locale
[09:29:44] <jzaefferer> Updates on the issue description are very easy to miss
[09:30:12] <rxaviers> plural-forms are: zero | one | two | few | many | other
[09:30:38] <jzaefferer> Let's do the PR and I can ask my questions there :-)
[09:30:43] <rxaviers> ehehe
[09:30:53] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/241
[09:30:57] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what are your thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/234 ?
[09:31:05] <rxaviers> Im working on #234 Globalize instances. It's implemented, Im finishing the docs update.
[09:31:11] <rxaviers> I am following what you suggested
[09:31:19] <rxaviers> Globalize( locale )
[09:31:49] <rxaviers> as soon as I finish docs I will open a PR and let you know too
[09:31:54] * uGoMobi is here now
[09:31:56] <jzaefferer> Well, you never responded to that ticket
[09:32:20] <jzaefferer> Or was there a different ticket that I forgot about?
[09:32:23] <jzaefferer> Hey Jasper
[09:32:30] <uGoMobi> hey jzaefferer
[09:35:20] <jzaefferer> Let's finish with Globalize
[09:36:06] <jzaefferer> If figured out why the tests didn't run with browserstack-runner and send a PR to fix their issue, didn't get a response so far. Once that's done we can look into implementing it properly, with Travis et al
[09:36:28] <rxaviers> great!
[09:36:56] <jzaefferer> globalizejs.com now redirects to jquery.com, still need to actually set up the site
[09:37:31] <rxaviers> great, we have a domain already \o/
[09:37:36] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: was that all for Globalize?
[09:37:41] <rxaviers> yep
[09:37:43] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:38:19] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:38:33] <jzaefferer> fnagel: previous notes said "Felix to test with aria-describedby instead of modifying for-attribute" for selectmenu
[09:38:51] <jzaefferer> well, its been there for two weeks
[09:39:25] <jzaefferer> I guess inbetween we got the reply from Hans and Scott just merged his PR
[09:39:29] <fnagel> Outdated. I've tried with negative results.
[09:39:33] <fnagel> right
[09:39:58] <jzaefferer> Scott fixed some tests and I think TJ reviewed docs
[09:40:01] <fnagel> Still need to figure out how to implement one of hans ideas.
[09:40:17] <fnagel> Help is appriciated
[09:41:35] <jzaefferer> I think I saw something about TJ fixing selectmenu API docs
[09:41:39] <jzaefferer> Can't find that though
[09:43:02] <jzaefferer> Any idea what I'm talking about?
[09:43:24] <fnagel> No sorry
[09:44:19] <jzaefferer> brb
[09:47:16] <jzaefferer> I kind of  messed up the meeting notes when I edited the notes from two weeks ago :/
[09:47:48] <jzaefferer> there
[09:47:49] <jzaefferer> that's better
[09:48:11] <jzaefferer> fnagel: Let's find some time to look at selectmenu's ARIA implementation
[09:48:34] <fnagel> jepp
[09:49:07] <fnagel> Think we'll need to try some more of hans ideas and test with screenreader
[09:49:32] <jzaefferer> As for the rest of the agenda: 1.11.0-beta.1 is out. I haven't heard or seen any negative feedback. Just three more or less meaningless comments on the blog
[09:49:56] <jzaefferer> There's some stuff we need to fix for the RC
[09:50:04] <jzaefferer> I guess most people wait for the final to start testing
[09:50:16] <jzaefferer> Which I can relate to, since our pre-releases aren't available through download builder
[09:50:43] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: any thoughts on that? How much effort would it be to put the beta on jqueryui.com/download?
[09:50:54] <fnagel> definitly. I already spent a lot of time but did not find a suitable solution until now
[09:51:19] <rxaviers> Are we going to release https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/178 as part of 1.11?
[09:51:25] <arschmitz> we have git and betas on mobile
[09:51:44] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: no, that can and likely should wait
[09:51:52] <rxaviers> excellent
[09:52:11] <jzaefferer> now that the beta is out, we need no further delays
[09:52:19] <jzaefferer> but it might be good to get the RC.1 on there
[09:52:26] <uGoMobi> I remember Scott was very much against git version on the DB
[09:52:27] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: do you get feedback on pre-releases?
[09:52:38] <arschmitz> rxaviers: more then you have so far
[09:52:43] <jzaefferer> we don't need git there, but beta and rc seems sane
[09:52:51] <uGoMobi> yeah, agreed
[09:53:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah git is only nice to make sure something you have done did not break download builder
[09:53:18] <arschmitz> not as usefull to other people though
[09:53:19] <uGoMobi> true
[09:53:26] <uGoMobi> more for internal use
[09:54:06] <arschmitz> rxaviers: related to handling css we have had something come up recently that it would be awesome if DB could handle
[09:54:10] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, putting 1.11 beta on DB is easy
[09:54:20] <jzaefferer> Okay, great, let's try that
[09:54:25] <rxaviers> ok
[09:54:39] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will put it on stage and let you know
[09:54:42] <arschmitz> rxaviers: the ability to get just the css for a component and not the js useful for things like css only buttons or controlgroups
[09:54:49] <rxaviers> then, if it's ok we tag it to production
[09:55:37] <rxaviers> arschmitz, is this feature related to packing?
[09:55:47] <rxaviers> or serving css?
[09:55:52] <rxaviers> dynamically
[09:56:07] <arschmitz> packing just for use in the download builder
[09:56:17] <jzaefferer> arschmitz uGoMobi fnagel: Would be good to get some feedback on https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/207 - I will review that, too
[09:56:31] <rxaviers> About that...
[09:56:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, will do asap
[09:56:55] <fnagel> ok
[09:57:05] <arschmitz> im actually the only person that has commented on that :)
[09:57:13] <rxaviers> Yeah, it would be of great value if team could review that and give feedback.
[09:57:13] <arschmitz> but i will give more feedback
[09:57:17] <jzaefferer> I know, but only with a question :-)
[09:57:26] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:57:30] <rxaviers> I've been able to use gseguin's css builder just fine... Handling CSS dependencies is part of UI + Mobile merge.
[09:57:46] <rxaviers> Right now, using css builder won't help too much the UI package. It will actually duplicate the current code in some places, because UI package is so complex (and sometimes confusing), see #207.
[09:57:51] <rxaviers> Simplify UI package will help us reach UI + Mobile merge.
[09:58:16] <arschmitz> yeah the mobile package is VERY simple in comparison
[09:58:48] <rxaviers> It would be great if UI package could accept a couple of simplifications.
[09:59:04] <rxaviers> wait for your comments. :D
[09:59:10] <rxaviers> all from my part.
[09:59:25] <fnagel> rxaviers: agree
[09:59:45] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: will look into this week
[09:59:58] <arschmitz> rxaviers: im all for simplifying
[10:00:06] <rxaviers> \o/
[10:00:09] <arschmitz> it seems crazy complex to me
[10:00:21] <arschmitz> way more so the it need / should be
[10:00:30] <rxaviers> I've been working on this package for some time, and I get confused sometimes.
[10:00:56] <arschmitz> rxaviers: i can imagein i was confused looking at it
[10:02:13] <jzaefferer> As long as we don't force users to download the images in a separate zip file...
[10:02:17] <fnagel> Any ideas how to simplify without removing the unminified files?
[10:02:24] <jzaefferer> That's too simple :p
[10:02:30] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah agreed i hate that
[10:03:24] <arschmitz> if we want to keep the unminifed alongside built files why dont we just use a dist directory?
[10:03:52] <fnagel> do we really need to have the minified files in the development bundle? Either you use the packed files (js and css) or you building your own packed files from the unminified sources
[10:03:55] <arschmitz> i mean the development alongside built sorry
[10:04:39] <jzaefferer> yeah, that very much seems unnecessary
[10:04:59] <jzaefferer> If you really want to include everything, download a bundle with everything
[10:05:42] <jzaefferer> Let's take that discussion to the issue on GitHub
[10:05:48] <jzaefferer> thanks everyone!
[10:05:50] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:06:01] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer arschmitz : we can talk about button CSS later on -dev
[10:07:16] <fnagel> bye
[10:09:24] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: yes, thanks
