[08:59:51] <kborchers> hi :)
[08:59:54] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:07] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: fnagel gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov tj_vantoll1
[09:00:14] <arschmitz> hi
[09:00:40] <tj_vantoll1> hey
[09:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we have much to talk about today.
[09:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything?
[09:01:55] <arschmitz> just one question
[09:02:13] <arschmitz> is there a reason to have the disabled option null and not true or false?
[09:02:24] <arschmitz> on button
[09:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, so that it inherits from the input.
[09:02:37] <arschmitz> but if we check the input in getCreateOptions
[09:02:42] <arschmitz> it will default to that anyway
[09:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> Then the default is a lie.
[09:02:57] <arschmitz> right
[09:03:24] <arschmitz> so shouldnt the default just be false and it will get changed to true if it is disabled?
[09:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> That would mean that by default it is not disabled.
[09:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Which isn't the case.
[09:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> The default is that it checks the actual element.
[09:03:59] <arschmitz> ok
[09:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> And that's what null represents.
[09:04:13] <arschmitz> ok that makes sense
[09:04:35] <arschmitz> but after create if you check the option should it return null
[09:04:38] <arschmitz> or the elements value?
[09:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> Once it's initialized, the option should always be a boolean.
[09:05:16] <arschmitz> ok thanks
[09:05:18] <arschmitz> thats all
[09:05:21] <arschmitz> for me
[09:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> That was easy :-)
[09:05:35] <arschmitz> im updating the wiki right now for buttonset
[09:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Anything from you?
[09:05:42] <arschmitz> or controlgroup
[09:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Anything from you?
[09:07:27] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: no not atm
[09:07:44] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: or no new topics ;-)
[09:08:10] <jzaefferer> fnagel: you could start looking at the datepicker rewrite
[09:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers, mikesherov, tj_vantoll1: Anything from any of you?
[09:08:46] <kborchers> i've been digging into UI tests using pointer events, specifically draggable
[09:08:57] <kborchers> many of them pass just hacking pointer events into mouse
[09:09:14] <kborchers> the ones that fail just have wrong output and no errors which makes it fun to track down issues :)
[09:09:25] <fnagel> jzaefferer: Yes! Perhaps we could have a small kickoff call the next few days.
[09:09:35] <tj_vantoll1> Nothing from me. Going through the editing phase of the book, hoping to be more involved relatively soon.
[09:09:51] <tj_vantoll1> What's left for 1.11?
[09:10:21] <jzaefferer> rxaviers is working on the quick downloads
[09:10:30] <jzaefferer> that looked like it should be done this week
[09:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> Final review of selectmenu, quick download generation, release script, image generation for themes.
[09:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything from you?
[09:15:03] <rxaviers> like jzaefferer said, I plan to finish the quick downloads generation by thieow
[09:15:09] <tj_vantoll1> Ok thanks. Anything in particular I can help out with? My book is written from a 1.11 perspective so I have a vested interest in seeing it released :)
[09:15:09] <rxaviers> the eow
[09:15:48] <jzaefferer> you mean end of week?
[09:15:53] <rxaviers> correct
[09:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: If you want to do some more testing/reviewing of selectmenu, it's always helpful to have more eyes.
[09:17:29] <rxaviers> about IM 6.8.0-7 issue Scott found last time releasing jQuery UI, thanks jzaefferer for testing it out
[09:17:29] <tj_vantoll1> ok
[09:17:48] <rxaviers> (https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/144)
[09:18:15] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do you still have imagemagick 6.8.0-7 installed? (convert --version to check)
[09:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:19:01] <rxaviers> it'd be good if scott_gonzalez could test it using the latest patch
[09:19:06] <jzaefferer> I'm on 10.9.2, that might explain the difference
[09:19:35] <rxaviers> 10.9.2?
[09:19:43] <jzaefferer> can we add a check to the build that generates this one image and compares it to the reference?
[09:19:48] <jzaefferer> OSX 10.9.2
[09:19:51] <rxaviers> ah ok
[09:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm installing something, not sure what version. We'll see what I end up with.
[09:20:23] <rxaviers> ok
[09:20:47] <jzaefferer> Otherwise you still still update OSX :p
[09:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, whenever this finishes installing, we can continue this in -dev and the GH issue.
[09:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:23:17] <rxaviers> ok
[09:23:22] <rxaviers> I have some globalize updates
[09:23:48] <rxaviers> An initial number format implementation has landed
[09:24:03] <rxaviers> It supports Integer and fraction digits format,
[09:24:08] <rxaviers> Significant digits format
[09:24:14] <rxaviers> grouping separators,
[09:24:20] <rxaviers> and negative patterns

[09:25:28] <rxaviers> (as a 2nd priority after DB things)
[09:25:56] <rxaviers> that's all
[09:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:26:52] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
