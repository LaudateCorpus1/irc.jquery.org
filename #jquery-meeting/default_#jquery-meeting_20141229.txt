[09:00:50] <DaveMethvin> hellloooo!
[09:01:06] <arthurvr> hellooo!
[09:01:12] <DaveMethvin> okay, we got someone!
[09:01:22] <DaveMethvin> hey arthurvr!
[09:01:25] <gibson042> sometwo, even
[09:01:27] <DaveMethvin> thanks for your help on the docs
[09:01:36] <DaveMethvin> can we go for somethree?
[09:01:42] <gibson042> yes, thank you
[09:02:17] <DaveMethvin> like all good software projects, we tend to abuse our docs :)
[09:02:32] <DaveMethvin> i really do want to stop doing that tho
[09:02:32] <arthurvr> haha, Hope I can help out ;-)
[09:03:34] <DaveMethvin> m_gol you around?
[09:03:34] <m_gol> present
[09:03:36] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: what did you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1969
[09:04:34] <DaveMethvin> seems like there is at least the potential for problems if we throw early out of that block
[09:04:38] <DaveMethvin> and miss some feature detects
[09:04:45] <DaveMethvin> but none of them affect firefox afaict
[09:04:55] <gibson042> yes, that's true
[09:05:00] <DaveMethvin> so it doesn't cause problems at the moment
[09:05:10] <gibson042> it's probably worth documenting with a comment
[09:06:22] <gibson042> and a mozilla bug report
[09:06:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wonder if it is xhtml related
[09:07:04] <DaveMethvin> damn screwed up the link to sizzle
[09:07:43] <DaveMethvin> there we go
[09:08:18] <DaveMethvin> maybe \f isn't legal in xhtml values?
[09:08:29] <DaveMethvin> might need to be encoded
[09:08:29] <gibson042> hmmmm
[09:08:50] <DaveMethvin> oh did i mention I HATE XHTML
[09:09:29] <gibson042> ugh
[09:10:11] <DaveMethvin> we really do need some sort of sanity check for XHTML
[09:10:56] <m_gol> if we want to work in XHTML, this sanity check will probably mean most of the test suite
[09:11:05] <DaveMethvin> altho in this case it wouldn't have helped
[09:11:21] <m_gol> actually, is there anything that'd work in XHTML and not work in HTML?
[09:11:22] <DaveMethvin> well just something to keep us from looking stupid when it won't even load in xhtml :)
[09:11:47] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[09:12:08] <DaveMethvin> i can't recall, there are issues in oldIE but that may not matter
[09:12:15] <DaveMethvin> i think ie11 added xhtml support
[09:12:24] <DaveMethvin> and actually has the right doctype
[09:12:36] <m_gol> the doctype doesn't matter for XHTML
[09:12:38] <m_gol> formally
[09:12:45] <m_gol> at least not for XHTML5
[09:13:04] <m_gol> only the mime type served is taken into account
[09:13:18] <DaveMethvin> unless it's a local file
[09:13:24] <DaveMethvin> then the extension matters
[09:13:30] <DaveMethvin> at least for ff
[09:13:43] <DaveMethvin> but that's not relevant for our swarm testing
[09:14:35] <m_gol> local files are not served by a web serwer so Fx is probably proxying them and guessing the mime type in the process :)
[09:14:37] <m_gol> but yeah
[09:15:12] <gibson042> at any rate, I don't see the message when loading our test suite in Firefox, which does lend credence to the XHTML hypothesis
[09:15:12] <DaveMethvin> the only reason I wouldn't like running XHTML is that it's not the way 90% of jQuery users run it
[09:15:46] <m_gol> yeah, if there are any edge-case bugs we wouldn't catch them, that'd be bad
[09:15:58] <m_gol> maybe it's time for another weekly run ;)
[09:16:11] <DaveMethvin> might be the best way to fix it
[09:16:26] <DaveMethvin> can we change the mime type for just one run?
[09:17:10] <DaveMethvin> that might be tricky
[09:17:26] <DaveMethvin> there's probably some trick where we could serve it from a different place
[09:17:29] <m_gol> we can set env variable for that & use it
[09:17:35] <DaveMethvin> or pass in something on the url
[09:17:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:17:45] <m_gol> we'd need to change the start template to PHP
[09:17:49] <DaveMethvin> m_gol can you take a look?
[09:18:02] <DaveMethvin> there's an existing ticket for xhtml let me find it
[09:18:20] <m_gol> k, just probably not before next week :)
[09:18:22] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1731
[09:18:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah this isn't a priority
[09:18:43] <m_gol> I'll set the milestone to 3.0.0 for now but we'll see how it goes
[09:18:46] <gibson042> I still think Sizzle isn't doing anything wrong
[09:19:53] <DaveMethvin> so it's okay to have an unescaped formfeed in attribute values in xhtml? i haven't looked at the spec
[09:20:01] <gibson042> XML seems to allow it
[09:20:08] <gibson042> http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-AttValue
[09:21:02] <DaveMethvin> you sure?
[09:21:40] <DaveMethvin> looks like a charref is basically alphanumeric or an entity?
[09:22:29] <DaveMethvin> i just love winding my way through these specs
[09:22:33] <gibson042> yes, but we're not using a ref
[09:22:36] <gibson042> just the literal
[09:23:03] <DaveMethvin> ooooh
[09:23:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:23:18] <DaveMethvin> \f is a backslash and an f
[09:23:22] <DaveMethvin> but that converts to a formfeed
[09:23:29] <DaveMethvin> and that is injected as (x)HTML
[09:23:37] <gibson042> right
[09:23:49] <DaveMethvin> but shouldn't that be a &xxx instead?
[09:24:12] <gibson042> well, that's the question
[09:24:22] <gibson042> but I don't think it needs such escaping
[09:24:54] <gibson042> because it's not a less-than, ampersand, or quote
[09:25:49] <DaveMethvin> eventually it comes down to http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-Char tho doesn't it?
[09:26:06] <DaveMethvin> like a tab could be there unescaped but not a FF
[09:27:05] <DaveMethvin> the only non-escaped "control chars" allowed are tab, cr, lf by my reading
[09:27:42] <DaveMethvin> below that, it says "white space" is space, tab, cr, lf   .... but not ff
[09:28:19] <gibson042> reading now
[09:30:00] <DaveMethvin> the whole mess with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1967  ... cors
[09:30:21] <DaveMethvin> i think there may be some undocumented magic issues there
[09:30:22] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: I don't see a direct link between AttValue and Char, but it looks implied, so I think you're right
[09:30:45] <DaveMethvin> i followed some link trail gibson042 let me see if i left breadcrumbs
[09:31:09] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-Reference
[09:31:18] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-CharRef
[09:31:27] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#wf-Legalchar
[09:31:36] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-Char
[09:31:51] <gibson042> NT-Reference is the wrong starting point
[09:31:58] <DaveMethvin> oh haha
[09:32:08] <gibson042> but it still looks like you're right
[09:32:12] <gibson042> I can make the change
[09:33:11] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[09:33:34] <DaveMethvin> it probably deserves a Sizzle ticket
[09:33:46] <gibson042> yeah
[09:33:54] <DaveMethvin> on to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1967
[09:34:34] <DaveMethvin> in various places we document the support.cors flag to be set manually by users
[09:34:37] <m_gol> on one hand I agree we should just kill jQuery.support once we figure out how to do that and still keep tests
[09:34:45] <m_gol> OTH, what you said ;)
[09:34:58] <m_gol> this was also advised in a couple of tickets
[09:35:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's not "official" but that's how you get some unusual xhr impls to work properly
[09:35:09] <m_gol> as a way of hacking around our detection
[09:35:20] <DaveMethvin> i believe it happens in phonegap
[09:35:35] <DaveMethvin> and also on ie xhr when used locally for getting remote files
[09:35:42] <DaveMethvin> strange cases like that
[09:35:56] <DaveMethvin> basically where we can't know it's legal to do a cross-origin request without help
[09:36:20] <DaveMethvin> and the transport finder in $.ajax would get confused otherwise
[09:36:41] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno how to get out of this trap very easily
[09:37:13] <DaveMethvin> perhaps we just document it
[09:37:46] <m_gol> if we document anything out of jQuery.support, we need to document jQuery.support as wekk
[09:37:48] <m_gol> * as well
[09:38:00] <DaveMethvin> we don't document jquery.fx
[09:38:06] <DaveMethvin> not that i'm proud of that one either :)
[09:38:09] <m_gol> ;)
[09:38:21] <DaveMethvin> it's just a mystery incantation i guess
[09:38:35] <m_gol> IMO if we're going to document anything out of jQuery.support we should move everything we can out of it
[09:38:36] <DaveMethvin> "If you have a strange setup, set jQuery.support.cors to true
[09:38:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah we don't need to dump any more stuff in it
[09:39:15] <DaveMethvin> and don't need to maintain stuff there for sure
[09:39:18] <m_gol> the only problem is that we need jQuery.support props to test results in supported browsers
[09:39:24] <m_gol> so we need a way to get to it in tests
[09:39:43] <m_gol> maybe we just should run unit/support.js tests in AMD mode only or sth
[09:39:51] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[09:40:14] <DaveMethvin> well perhaps we maintain the status quo
[09:40:14] <DaveMethvin> none of our internal feature detects should be documented there
[09:40:15] <m_gol> that's another option ;)
[09:40:30] <DaveMethvin> and we just specify the one exception regarding jquery.support.cors
[09:40:38] <m_gol> though I feel telling people that setting jQuery.support.cors is OK is inviting them to touch other support props
[09:40:48] <DaveMethvin> they'll learn quickly enough :)
[09:40:54] <m_gol> ;)
[09:41:01] <DaveMethvin> if we could move it that woudl be great
[09:41:05] <DaveMethvin> but it's been around a long time
[09:41:10] <DaveMethvin> so we probably can't move it
[09:41:20] <DaveMethvin> and we'd just create a new way to get to it that nobody would use
[09:41:38] <m_gol> ok, then we should test the result of setting that prop
[09:41:58] <DaveMethvin> but it only applies in rare cases, not sure we test any of those
[09:42:05] <DaveMethvin> like phonegap
[09:42:33] <DaveMethvin> really it seems like we got into this trouble because of the transport selector
[09:42:44] <DaveMethvin> if we were just doing xhr we wouldn't need to test cors i think
[09:43:00] <DaveMethvin> if you just did a request and there was no cors, it would give you an error
[09:43:40] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:43:47] <timmywil> hi there
[09:44:43] <DaveMethvin> just wondering if there is a way to replace the "no transport" with a "screw it, just try xhr anyway"
[09:45:03] <DaveMethvin> we can discuss on that ticket i guess
[09:45:19] <m_gol> if that can be done, that'd be best
[09:45:30] <timmywil_> starbucks wifi
[09:45:37] <m_gol> we wouldn't have to document private props and external libs wouldn't even need to modify anything
[09:46:39] <gibson042> I agree
[09:47:02] <DaveMethvin> i didn't wrap up https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1967 from last week
[09:47:43] <DaveMethvin> seems like we should just tell him to get as .html() and set as .text() which i think works
[09:48:05] <m_gol> that's the support.cors issue
[09:48:22] <arthurvr> you mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1956?
[09:48:25] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1956
[09:48:27] <DaveMethvin> sorry
[09:48:55] <DaveMethvin> gotta improve my copy/pasta game
[09:49:13] <m_gol> he said: ".text() converts all the tags to html entities, so I can't."
[09:49:35] <DaveMethvin> oh both ways
[09:51:30] <DaveMethvin> setting as .text() seems to work?
[09:52:04] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/ku26kaq3/19/
[09:52:12] <gibson042> it did just now when I tried it
[09:52:35] <m_gol> hmm, right
[09:52:51] <gibson042> but so does `.innerHTML = value`, which means it's something we're (not) doing
[09:53:08] <DaveMethvin> we're trying to convert to a DOM first tho, right?
[09:53:30] <DaveMethvin> setting as text avoids that
[09:53:44] <DaveMethvin> i'll ask him about setting as text
[09:53:50] <timmywil> works for me
[09:54:25] <m_gol> so, my basic Node smoke tests have landed
[09:54:47] <m_gol> I hope jsdom weird compilation requirements didn't break anyone's build ;)
[09:55:04] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 how is that .then() patch coming?
[09:55:13] <gibson042> I was just working on it today
[09:55:25] <DaveMethvin> i should have time this week to work on several things
[09:55:32] <gibson042> should have something to discuss by next meeting
[09:55:34] <DaveMethvin> hope to get a lot of tickets and pulls cleaned up
[09:55:43] <DaveMethvin> sounds good, i'd like to get that one landed asap
[09:55:56] <gibson042> right
[09:56:05] <DaveMethvin> any other critical items?
[09:56:22] <DaveMethvin> we've gotten a few new contribs lately which is awesome
[09:56:33] <DaveMethvin> always nice to have others doing some work :)
[09:57:13] <DaveMethvin> okay, you'll probalby see me summoning various people as i go through the tickets, hope I don't get too annoying!
[09:57:21] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys
[09:57:29] <timmywil> peace
[09:57:33] <DaveMethvin> happy new year!
[09:57:42] <arthurvr> bye guys! happy 2015!
