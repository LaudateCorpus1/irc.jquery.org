[09:00:01] <rxaviers> hey!
[09:00:15] <mikesherov_> here
[09:00:22] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:30] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything to discuss for button? We'll finally get a full review of the existing code once 1.11 ships.
[09:01:55] <jzaefferer> where "existing code" refers to the rewrite?
[09:02:00] <arschmitz> i updated with wiki with proposed api and stuff for controlgroup
[09:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:02:10] <jzaefferer> I actually started that a week ago or so
[09:02:24] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:02:24] <arschmitz> and i have addressed everything jzaefferer mentioned and pushed that
[09:02:50] <jzaefferer> well, then we can start over with the reviewing :-)
[09:03:11] <jzaefferer> meeting notes still say "Determine if we really want to support anchors" - did we make any progress on that?
[09:03:33] <arschmitz> we talked about it but not sure we made a decision last time?
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, no decision.
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything to discuss for Globalize?
[09:09:01] <rxaviers> My Globalize updates for this week is PR #224, which  is supposed to fix Documentation on regard of #206, #210, #218 and #225.
[09:09:15] <rxaviers> WIP docs: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/fix-218-getting-started/README.md
[09:09:54] <mikesherov_> Just wanted to add, before I forget about this tab, that I'll be finishing the effects rewrite pending stuff this week
[09:10:06] <mikesherov_> I just came off a large all time consuming project at work
[09:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: Awesome. It might make it into 1.11 then :-)
[09:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I started another review of selectmenu.
[09:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1224
[09:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> We also cleaned up the demos: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/9d78023e35b4687bb2557293bda1e73e427733c3
[09:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have ideas for better demos?
[09:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> Our demos in general aren't very exciting, so this is par for the course.
[09:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> But if anyone has more enticing demo ideas, that's always helpful :-)
[09:13:17] <fnagel> Demo origin is filament group a loooong time ago ;-)
[09:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:14:08] <tj_vantoll> I'll think about it.
[09:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to do a review of tests and docs.
[09:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> But we're making good progress.
[09:14:55] <arschmitz> ill look at what we have for mobile demos not sure we have anything exciting but might be something neet that could be adapted
[09:15:02] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: you don't know anyone who's working on a JS widget framework with cool demos, do you?
[09:15:39] <tj_vantoll> http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/web/dropdownlist/index.html
[09:16:41] <jzaefferer> It should apply a transform to change the size of the image when you select a different size :-)
[09:16:52] <tj_vantoll> :P
[09:17:16] <rxaviers> In firefox, the popup keeps closing just after it's been opened to me.
[09:17:18] <jzaefferer> The "Edit this example" reminds me of our idea to integrate jsbin
[09:17:34] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: we're looking for ideas, not bugs :p
[09:17:40] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:17:41] <arschmitz> yeah i like that
[09:17:49] <rxaviers> Yeap, editing is really nice
[09:18:25] <fnagel> rxaviers: OS and version of FF?
[09:18:45] <rxaviers> linux 25.0
[09:18:53] <rxaviers> linux, firefox 25.0
[09:19:14] <tj_vantoll> The cascading dropdown idea is interesting, other than that most of Kendo UI's demos are data binding examples.
[09:20:07] <fnagel> rxaviers: does it work with keybaord control?
[09:21:05] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: Are you referring to Kendo UI's or jQuery UI's?
[09:21:16] <tj_vantoll> I’m heading out momentarily, so I’ll give one update as well: I’ve been doing some research into widgets + Web Components. A colleague of mine got it sort of working with Kendo UI, but it’s a mess: https://github.com/kendo-labs/polymer-kendoui. (See https://github.com/kendo-labs/polymer-kendoui/blob/master/components/k-autocomplete.html for instance.) You can’t reuse much of the existing code because everything fu
[09:21:34] <rxaviers> fnagel, tj_vantoll, Im moving our conv to -dev ok
[09:21:55] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: fu?
[09:23:37] <tj_vantoll> ?
[09:24:01] <jzaefferer> Your last message ended with this: "You can’t reuse much of the existing code because everything fu"
[09:24:25] <tj_vantoll> "You can’t reuse much of the existing code because everything fundamentally changes."
[09:24:31] <tj_vantoll> Odd, didn't cut out for me.
[09:24:40] <jzaefferer> gotcha
[09:25:27] <tj_vantoll> I'm still tinkering at this point.
[09:25:31] <rxaviers> (I got "fu" too)
[09:26:21] <tj_vantoll> Anyways I'm heading out.
[09:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:30:20] <rxaviers> well if anyone wants to take a look at an AMD question.
[09:30:26] <rxaviers> arschmitz has helped me out yesterday
[09:30:31] <rxaviers> But, I couldnt figure out yet.
[09:30:38] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/10194312
[09:31:02] <rxaviers> I have propagated that question on #requirejs, stackoverflow, and github/requirejs...
[09:34:20] <jzaefferer> maybe related to how requirejs deals with ".js" at the end?
[09:34:36] <rxaviers> there's no .js at the end, right?
[09:34:40] <jzaefferer> that is, maybe it cuts of the "js", resulting in paths that don't match anymore?
[09:35:39] <arschmitz> tyr changing to something else and see if it works like cldrjq
[09:35:46] <rxaviers> the trailing js of cldrjs should be treated as any other string :-S
[09:35:57] <rxaviers> yeap, I had. But, it doesnt
[09:36:38] <rxaviers> well, I guess if something has more ideas, please bring them to me at -dev.
[09:36:42] <rxaviers> someone*
[09:37:11] <jzaefferer> do you have links to your SO question and ticket on GitHub?
[09:37:44] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/1084
[09:37:53] <rxaviers> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22949132/require-js-cldrjs-why-renaming-a-config-paths-entry-break-it
[09:39:22] <jzaefferer> no idea
[09:39:38] <rxaviers> thks
[09:42:30] <jzaefferer> I think for the release everything is ready, just need to land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1203
[09:43:03] <jzaefferer> The changes in DB and the jqueryui.com repo are already in master, tagged and published
[09:43:11] <jzaefferer> See also http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9743#comment:11
[09:44:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: am I missing something?
[09:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think os.
[09:45:30] <jzaefferer> Should I squash these four? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1203/commits
[09:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do another test of that and make sure everything looks good.
[09:46:13] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can land that and close the ticket as well.
[09:46:18] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:46:25] <jzaefferer> I'll squash it now in my branch
[09:47:57] <jzaefferer> done
[10:00:32] <jzaefferer> well, thanks everyone!
