[08:00:21] <JamesMGreene> brb
[08:02:55] * JamesMGreene is back, whoamg
[08:08:49] <JamesMGreene> Testing meeting on today?
[08:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged jzaefferer earlier and didn't get a response.
[08:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> So probably not.
[08:18:21] <JamesMGreene> Hey scottgonzalez, what was your particular interest in my HTML5 spec proposal for getting a reference to the pertinent Error object when an error is unhandled?
[08:18:41] <JamesMGreene> I recall you inquiring if there was any activity on it a while back
[08:19:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just general interest in error handling being better.
[08:19:11] <JamesMGreene> Hear hear
[08:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> It seemed mostly stalled in the mailing lists.
[08:20:34] <JamesMGreene> Yeah
[08:20:47] <JamesMGreene> Ian replied a few weeks ago but I've been too buried to reply
[08:20:53] <JamesMGreene> Probably about time to get to it -_-
[08:31:34] <JamesMGreene> well, meeting looks like a no-go
[08:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:31:59] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer, if the meeting starts after I leave, please ping me on Gmail
[08:32:15] <JamesMGreene> TTFN
[10:01:35] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: gnarf agcolom kswedberg rworth danheberden
[10:01:41] <ajpiano> time for a content meeting
[10:01:56] <ajpiano> we can keep it quick cause we're all pretty  slammed,
[10:01:56] <kswedberg> hi
[10:02:54] <ajpiano> kswedberg: what was it you were asking earlier about the... contributing to documentation documentation
[10:02:55] <ajpiano> :p
[10:03:24] <kswedberg> :)
[10:03:29] <agcolom> hey!
[10:03:38] <ajpiano> howdy agcolom
[10:03:51] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I was saying that I didn't know how much to put in that page and how much to just link to other pages/resources
[10:04:02] <ajpiano> ah ok, i think you struck a pretty good balance
[10:04:23] <ajpiano> i'd rather have things be a little duplicative but individually useful
[10:04:27] <ajpiano> than just have docs that are like
[10:04:33] <ajpiano> HOW TO DO THIS: READ THESE OTHER DOCS
[10:04:50] <kswedberg> yeah. Is there anything else you think I should put in there? What about Style Guide(s)?
[10:05:33] <ajpiano> +1 for style guides
[10:05:46] <kswedberg> Or maybe have a section saying "the learn site has a style guide[link] that you should read before you get started. For other sites, look at their contributing.md files
[10:06:17] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:06:24] <ajpiano> if you just put that under a heading on style guides
[10:06:28] <kswedberg> Or have a condensed style guide that applies to all and say that individual sites may have specific requirements
[10:06:28] <ajpiano> with another expository sentence on like
[10:06:34] <ajpiano> why following style guides is important
[10:06:45] <ajpiano> my last sentence + your last sentence = solution
[10:07:10] <kswedberg> awesome! I think I got it. I'll try to do that tonight. If not, this weekend for sure.
[10:07:18] <ajpiano> if we could find some cross section that applied to everywhere, we could definitely add a style-guide/docs page
[10:07:29] <kswedberg> I don't think it would be terrible to launch it as is and fill it in later.
[10:07:35] <kswedberg> ok.
[10:07:46] <ajpiano> right on
[10:07:59] <kswedberg> yay! :)
[10:08:01] <ajpiano> a quick mention of the stlye guide would be good to get in asap
[10:08:19] <kswedberg> ok. I can do that tonight
[10:08:25] <kswedberg> at least
[10:08:31] <ajpiano> sweet
[10:08:41] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: are you around
[10:08:49] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:09:08] <ajpiano> have you had a chance to make any progress on the "contributing code" docs
[10:09:26] * DaveMethvin looks sheepish
[10:09:28] <DaveMethvin> sorry
[10:09:33] <ajpiano> hey now you look like me :p
[10:09:44] <DaveMethvin> oooh i'm purdy now
[10:09:48] <ajpiano> do you think you have some time to build something out before tomorrow
[10:09:59] <DaveMethvin> realistically no
[10:10:05] <ajpiano> hrmmmmmm
[10:10:05] <DaveMethvin> i have a bunch of client work backed up
[10:10:10] <ajpiano> i understand that :/
[10:10:30] <ajpiano> i don't know if we can launch contrib w/o how to contrib code
[10:10:39] <ajpiano> but we can't really launch sites w/o contrib
[10:10:51] <DaveMethvin> aaarrrgh
[10:11:16] <DaveMethvin> i can probalby sketch out something tonight
[10:11:18] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: do you wanna not think about it right this secon
[10:11:28] <ajpiano> and then yeah, let's see how we're all doing at like 8pm tongiht?
[10:11:34] <DaveMethvin> that sounds good
[10:13:39] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if you could write a quick outline of your doc, i could try to add more words to it and punt it back to you for your awesomeness
[10:14:13] <DaveMethvin> maybe later this afternoon... i have about 2 hrs worth of work to do for a meeting in 45 minutes :D
[10:14:41] <gnarf> roger
[10:15:45] <ajpiano> ok let's all leave DaveMethvin alone and stop pinging him
[10:15:56] <ajpiano> soooooo other content things.......
[10:15:57] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:16:08] <ajpiano> danheberden: how goes ye olde jquery dot com
[10:19:14] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: let's connect later today on jquery.com and blog.jquery.com, i know you are slammed at the minute
[10:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:19:35] <ajpiano> i feel kind of okay about launching with a minimalist jquery.com based on what danheberden has done already
[10:19:42] <ajpiano> anything is an improvement over the old design
[10:24:20] <ajpiano> well. anyhow
[10:24:44] <ajpiano> we're launching a lot of sites tomorrow :) gotta get my head back down to work on that
[10:25:03] <ajpiano> see everyone back in #jquery-content, if we missed anything here please raise it there
[11:02:10] <johnbender> nice
[11:02:33] <gseguin> Hi all
[11:02:52] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:02:56] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:03:01] <JasonDScott___> Hi
[11:04:27] <toddmparker> Hi everyone!
[11:04:37] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:04:48] <toddmparker> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8l_ZxTZN2sVPP4C4VOivb--1-wWpT4LgDwn8HWeAGU/edit#
[11:05:19] <toddmparker> is gabriel here?
[11:05:35] <uGoMobi> I think he said he couldn't make it today
[11:05:38] <arschmitz> no he said he couldnt make it
[11:05:38] <toddmparker> agcolom: will be on later
[11:05:40] <toddmparker> ok
[11:05:46] <toddmparker> let's dive in
[11:05:57] <toddmparker> first: 1.3.0 Beta released  late this Monday
[11:06:07] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/01/14/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-3-0-beta/
[11:06:27] <toddmparker> I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for all the hard work on this one. It's a huge release.
[11:06:42] <toddmparker> I saw nothing but great feedback on twitter and the comments
[11:07:00] <johnbender> yar
[11:07:01] <toddmparker> we were able to get a lot done with our larger sized team
[11:07:10] <johnbender> very few bugs, which is either really good or really bad
[11:07:18] <arschmitz> seems like there really werent too many issues either
[11:07:33] <toddmparker> yeah, think that's good. seems like people were fired up to use it
[11:07:40] <johnbender> either we built it and tested it well or no one is paying attention :P
[11:07:47] <toddmparker> though 99% of people wait until final to test
[11:07:51] <johnbender> yep
[11:08:26] <toddmparker> nice job on triage and fixing. seems like we're tacking each issue right away
[11:08:47] <toddmparker> arschmitz and uGoMobi especially
[11:09:04] <toddmparker> johnbender wants to talk about the android nag issue but after this meeting
[11:09:25] <toddmparker> nav, not nag
[11:09:37] <uGoMobi> I am getting used to that typo ;)
[11:09:42] <toddmparker> heh
[11:09:50] <toddmparker> i am made of typos
[11:09:57] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:09:59] <johnbender> can I go?
[11:10:02] <johnbender> :)
[11:10:05] <toddmparker> johnbender: sure
[11:10:15] <johnbender> nag [sic] bug issues
[11:10:17] <johnbender> I think two of them
[11:10:20] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:10:37] <johnbender> I closed
[11:10:45] <johnbender> and we have a test problem
[11:10:55] <johnbender> possibly a depedency issue
[11:11:05] <toddmparker> saw that. did we figure out what's up with the failures?
[11:11:14] <johnbender> it's failing _hard_ on the pushstate disabled tests
[11:11:21] <toddmparker> hmm
[11:11:27] <johnbender> my hunch is it has something to do with load order when it fails
[11:11:35] <johnbender> because it fails for whole test pages
[11:12:01] <toddmparker> is this consistent or randomly?
[11:12:47] <johnbender> random
[11:12:58] <toddmparker> awesomesauce
[11:13:10] <johnbender> I'm not super concerned about it but it could be masking other issues
[11:13:44] <toddmparker> sure. so we're juts going to keep digging there to see if we can figure out the dependency/sequence problem
[11:13:49] <arschmitz> johnbender: if your talking about the problem we discussed last night this is every single build not random
[11:14:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: well it's every single build on the build server
[11:14:04] <johnbender> locally it runs fine
[11:14:10] <arschmitz> johnbender: right
[11:14:15] <johnbender> that makes it "random" with respect to the location/timing
[11:14:28] <arschmitz> johnbendr: gotca sorry
[11:14:29] <johnbender> given a location there's a probability that it will fail
[11:14:53] <johnbender> poor semantics on my part
[11:14:58] <johnbender> also
[11:15:19] <johnbender> the inital page issue that _|Nix|_ and arschmitz brought up yesterday
[11:15:30] <johnbender> either one of those could get looked at today
[11:15:34] <johnbender> I'm working on internal stuff
[11:15:39] <toddmparker> ok
[11:16:04] <uGoMobi> shouldn't the file order in those two files be the same: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.js and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/index.php
[11:16:04] <toddmparker> johnbender: you mention a working example of $.mobile.navigate
[11:16:12] <toddmparker> is that a todo or done?
[11:16:36] <uGoMobi> I ask because sometimes we don't see issues local, only in the build
[11:17:37] <toddmparker> good question
[11:17:42] <uGoMobi> like the nav issue
[11:17:55] <toddmparker> johnbender ^^
[11:18:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah I need to add that to the docs
[11:18:27] <toddmparker> in the meantime, on this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5453
[11:18:28] <b-ot> toddmparker, issue #5453 by erikyuzwa (1d 21h ago): scrolling with jqm1.3.0 beta 1 and jquery1.9.0 throws TypeError
[11:18:35] <johnbender> there's an open issue on the api docs repo
[11:18:49] <toddmparker> johnbender: ok, cool
[11:18:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: doesn't matter for the tests but yes
[11:19:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah ok
[11:19:29] <toddmparker> on that scull issue, any idea why it didn't pop up until beta?
[11:19:51] <toddmparker> just curious what we might be missing
[11:19:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker: change was made right before 1.9 release
[11:19:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: assuming you mean scroll, arschmitz didn't dave put something in?
[11:20:00] <johnbender> ah that's right
[11:20:02] <arschmitz> took it out lol
[11:20:04] <toddmparker> aaaah
[11:20:08] <johnbender> :/
[11:20:14] <johnbender> bummer
[11:20:23] <toddmparker> so it was a last minute change.
[11:20:28] * johnbender throws a crumple piece of paper at DaveMethvin 
[11:20:39] <arschmitz> yeah it was depreciated in 1.7 and was undocumented to begin with
[11:20:39] <johnbender> s/crumple/crumpled/
[11:20:56] <johnbender> do we have a fix on our side if it shouldn't be there anyway?
[11:21:02] <DaveMethvin> arschmitz is right, but still we should have taken it out before we did
[11:21:04] <toddmparker> some of this was my bad. i should have pushed our release out so it wasn't so close to 1.9
[11:21:05] <DaveMethvin> sorry guys
[11:21:06] <johnbender> I'm not familiar with event.handle
[11:21:27] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: because it's NOT DOCUMENTED :D
[11:21:34] <toddmparker> niiiice
[11:21:38] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: :) yes it's definitely our fault
[11:21:46] <johnbender> well
[11:21:47] <arschmitz> yeah its our bad should have fixed way back when 1.7 came out
[11:21:54] <johnbender> it's someone's fault I don't think I put that in there
[11:21:54] <DaveMethvin> if you knew we'd have to kill you ... havent' broken the news to arschmitz
[11:22:18] <DaveMethvin> well let's not get hung up on who screwed who, i think we're all sorry
[11:22:23] <toddmparker> he knows TOO MUCH
[11:22:51] <toddmparker> yep, we all need to hug it out
[11:23:14] <toddmparker> ok, I was just curious if we that issue popped up because we didn't have test coverage
[11:23:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker: it was in the git build
[11:23:40] <toddmparker> speaking of core
[11:23:43] <toddmparker> jQuery core 1.9.0 is now final - we should replace 1.8.3 in our docs today
[11:23:49] <toddmparker> (if we haven't already)
[11:23:53] <johnbender> word
[11:24:08] <toddmparker> anyone want to grab that?
[11:24:21] <arschmitz> i can
[11:24:43] <arschmitz> i already tested against it local
[11:24:44] <toddmparker> thanks arschmitz - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5474
[11:24:45] <b-ot> toddmparker, issue #5474 by toddparker (5m 1s ago): Upgrade docs to 1.9.0
[11:25:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[11:25:24] <toddmparker> I like the "Please review the guidelines for contributing to this repository." when creating a message
[11:25:31] <uGoMobi> there you can see which files you need to check
[11:26:10] <toddmparker> New jQuery Mobile API docs released - need to start redirecting people there and not updating the old docs site. Transition plan?
[11:26:30] <toddmparker> now that we're live, i'd like to sr=tart getting rid of redundencies
[11:27:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker: one thing we should be careful of is in the current docs there are a lot of little snippits and tips and notes that we dont want to lose
[11:28:05] <uGoMobi> true
[11:28:06] <arschmitz> a lot of them dont have an obvious home in api docs and are not currently in demos
[11:28:20] <toddmparker> agreed
[11:28:38] <arschmitz> a good chunk of these may have a good home in the FAQ section we talked about?
[11:28:39] <toddmparker> just be good to start pointing pages that are 1:1 to the API version
[11:28:48] <uGoMobi> I can come up with a plan and discuss with toddmparker and agcolom
[11:28:50] <toddmparker> link http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/textinputs/ to http://api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/
[11:29:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i think that makes sense
[11:29:11] <toddmparker> all the leftover stuff needs a new home in the PAI docs or in the new demos
[11:29:17] <toddmparker> API
[11:29:28] <toddmparker> but we can start shuffling stuff around
[11:29:58] <agcolom> I'm here now btw :-)
[11:30:01] <toddmparker> we should do a follow up to talk about the new demos IA
[11:30:05] <toddmparker> hey agcolom
[11:30:07] <arschmitz> I was thinking for the time being should we add a link to the docs home page to go to demos?
[11:30:08] <toddmparker> perfect timing
[11:30:20] <toddmparker> talking about switching over to the new API site
[11:30:29] <agcolom> oh yes!
[11:30:36] <uGoMobi> I was thinking of stop editing current docs and create new docs structure and design in a branch
[11:30:40] <toddmparker> and not keeping API info up to date in the old docs
[11:31:03] <uGoMobi> we can still keep a page in there for all widgets with link to the new API docs
[11:31:08] <agcolom> I'll try to do my first new api site tagging tomorrow or monday!
[11:31:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: sure. though I bet we can keep working in that folder for a while
[11:31:45] <toddmparker> yeah, we need to figure out how to re-direct
[11:32:25] <toddmparker> for example, i'd like to set up redirects for all the old docs pages so we don't break anything
[11:33:00] <toddmparker> let's pow-wow on a plan after this
[11:33:12] <toddmparker> agcolom: do you want to give us an update?
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> souns like a "plan"
[11:33:28] <toddmparker> hee
[11:33:32] <arschmitz> sorry cant resist bad puns
[11:33:38] <uGoMobi> for google we should probably add the redirects to htaccess on the server
[11:33:45] <agcolom> yes
[11:33:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: agreed
[11:33:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: agreed
[11:33:51] <uGoMobi> or whatever sort of config is used
[11:34:03] <agcolom> is it my turn?
[11:34:09] <toddmparker> agcolom: sure
[11:34:20] <agcolom> ok so     API docs:
[11:34:20] <agcolom>         updated example template to use JQM 1.3 beta and jQuery 1.8.3
[11:34:20] <agcolom>         updated jquery-wp-content footer to new CDN
[11:34:20] <agcolom>         updated data-attribute page
[11:34:20] <agcolom>         created entries for panels and rangeslider
[11:34:20] <agcolom>         added examples to isRelativeUrl and get methods
[11:34:21] <agcolom>         added new options to dialog
[11:34:50] <toddmparker> dang. great
[11:34:59] <agcolom> I now have instructions from scott_gonzalez to tag and deploy api.jquerymobile.com
[11:35:21] <agcolom> I will wait until he's around the first time I'll try... just in case I need help...
[11:35:31] <toddmparker> cool
[11:35:32] <agcolom> I just don't want to get the site broken!
[11:35:35] <toddmparker> so what's left to have the API docs as the 100% accurate reference
[11:35:50] <toddmparker> think there are just a few smaller updates to make?
[11:35:55] <agcolom> I think we don't yet have all the events and methods
[11:36:06] <toddmparker> ok
[11:36:32] <toddmparker> and there were a few small additions I emailed this weekend
[11:36:36] <agcolom> I need to add grids
[11:36:40] <agcolom> yes
[11:36:58] <agcolom> and the good news is I'll be talking at jQuery Europe!
[11:36:59] <toddmparker> http://api.jquerymobile.com/grid-layout/
[11:37:06] <toddmparker> you mean just the RWD stuff?
[11:37:10] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:37:18] <arschmitz> agcolom: is the configuring defaults stuff in there?
[11:37:22] <agcolom> yes the RWD
[11:37:35] <agcolom> arschmitz: not sure
[11:37:54] <toddmparker> this needs a home - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[11:38:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats what i was talking about
[11:38:08] <toddmparker> mobileinit event
[11:38:09] <agcolom> the talk is not written yet but I plan on seizing the opportunity to do lots of JQM demos
[11:38:22] <toddmparker> just goes here I think - http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/
[11:38:30] <toddmparker> agcolom: that's excellent
[11:38:46] <uGoMobi> I want to add text about how to set options in general
[11:38:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: Awesome!
[11:38:54] <agcolom> it will be Good UI design with jQuery Mobile
[11:39:10] <uGoMobi> how to override programmatically and with data- attr
[11:39:10] <agcolom> because we don't often get to demo the cool stuff...
[11:39:19] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:39:32] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: we could add a lot of high level info here - http://api.jquerymobile.com/
[11:39:41] <toddmparker> that landing page is bare
[11:39:51] <agcolom> it is bare indeed!
[11:40:02] <toddmparker> or add some more pages here - http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/reference/
[11:40:15] <toddmparker> getting started, theming, etc. can be ported there
[11:40:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats where i was thinking the global config stuff might be good
[11:40:30] <toddmparker> sure
[11:40:42] <toddmparker> we should document the mobileinit event too
[11:40:43] <uGoMobi> ok I can add a section there
[11:40:58] <uGoMobi> have text in a document
[11:41:01] <agcolom> I have getting started and something on theming on the learn site as well...
[11:41:08] <toddmparker> let's start pulling some of the higher-level pages from docs into the reference area here
[11:41:10] <agcolom> but we could also cross reference
[11:41:18] <toddmparker> agcolom: good idea
[11:41:44] <toddmparker> we could port the current theming page into the API and cross link to your article
[11:42:14] <agcolom> that'd be good.
[11:42:34] <toddmparker> ok, so new rule: all new stuff changes either happen in the API site or in demos
[11:42:47] <agcolom> ok
[11:42:52] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:43:06] <toddmparker> let's not touch the current docs except to add links out to the API site or whatever
[11:43:25] <toddmparker> did anyone do a content inventory?
[11:43:31] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/document/d/19h7zQEc9VMPMBy3xcFuylq5-9k_ETufgYQ-Kuq-yaGo/edit
[11:43:40] <toddmparker> ah, awesome
[11:43:42] <uGoMobi> I started
[11:43:58] <uGoMobi> text for configuring options is in there too
[11:44:18] <agcolom> nice! thanks uGoMobi
[11:44:38] <toddmparker> excellent
[11:45:48] <toddmparker> ok, so this isn't a content inventory. my bad. this is great though
[11:46:18] <uGoMobi> no you are right
[11:46:30] <uGoMobi> the idea was to make one in that document
[11:46:47] <toddmparker> agcolom: I know you're busy but would be able to help us port the site over to the new template? it's just a few pages so it should be straightforward.
[11:47:02] <agcolom> sure
[11:47:02] <toddmparker> think ajpiano is going to help with that
[11:47:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ok, cool
[11:47:16] <toddmparker> thanks agcolom
[11:47:19] <ajpiano> what am i doing now?
[11:47:30] <ajpiano> we talkin bout jquerymobile.com itself now yes?
[11:47:32] <toddmparker> fixing all the things, ajpiano
[11:47:38] <toddmparker> we are indeed. and the blog
[11:47:40] <ajpiano> ah ok i have a lot of things
[11:47:48] <ajpiano> blog is a different story :/
[11:48:01] <toddmparker> oh, ok. who's baby is that?
[11:48:09] <ajpiano> it's an orphan
[11:48:12] <ajpiano> no but seriously
[11:48:21] <ajpiano> so blogs are interesing place
[11:48:31] <ajpiano> we have been leaning toward consolidating them all into one blog
[11:48:38] <ajpiano> and moving it into jquery-wp-content
[11:48:42] <ajpiano> but it's a bunch of work
[11:48:42] <toddmparker> right, that was what I heard last
[11:49:02] <ajpiano> so far we have just created franken themes for blog.jqueryui.com and will be creating one for blog.jquery.com
[11:49:02] <toddmparker> so we back to to quick 'n dirty
[11:49:06] <ajpiano> to work in the middle term
[11:49:11] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:49:17] <ajpiano> but i don't think scott_gonzalez wants to create any more franken themes
[11:49:24] <toddmparker> understandable
[11:49:27] <ajpiano> you guys aren't going to be ready to switch untl mid feb though right?
[11:49:33] <toddmparker> right
[11:49:40] <toddmparker> we're pretty easy on timing too
[11:49:42] <ajpiano> ok, maybe we can make some progress on the blog stuff until then
[11:49:46] <toddmparker> but that was the goal
[11:49:50] <toddmparker> cool
[11:50:04] <toddmparker> seems like that would be a blocker for the site switching
[11:50:47] <toddmparker> the site itself is just a handful of pages so that will be easy once the blog is sorted
[11:50:55] <ajpiano> right
[11:51:02] <scott_gonzalez> So, tonight I'm going to try to make the blog theme a bit more tolerable to updates when I have to add blog.jquery.com, but not sure how well that will work.
[11:51:02] <ajpiano> the regular site is easy and halfway there
[11:51:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get the blogs done for real very soon though.
[11:51:20] <toddmparker> yep., just has old content atm
[11:51:25] <toddmparker> +1
[11:51:30] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: me too
[11:51:40] <ajpiano> i think once events is moved over, blogs next
[11:51:43] <toddmparker> just don't want to make you frankenblog again scott_gonzalez
[11:51:56] <toddmparker> we know you hate that
[11:52:24] <toddmparker> ok, cool. just give us a holler when you're getting ready to look at the mobile site
[11:52:33] <toddmparker> we have plenty to do until then :)
[11:52:40] <agcolom> just thought of something: is someone going to update themeroller for JQM1.3 beta or do we wait until 1.3 final?
[11:52:56] <toddmparker> we wait until final for TR changes
[11:52:59] <ajpiano> toddmparker: for .com, i don't think we're planning to look at it other than to help y'all with issues
[11:53:09] <toddmparker> the download builder has the beta though
[11:53:15] <ajpiano> like, you guys would refresh the content etc and if you run into problems with templates or what not we can assist
[11:53:26] <toddmparker> ajpiano: ok, sure
[11:53:26] <ajpiano> but agcolom is set up to work locally now so i think she can really jam on all tha tnow
[11:53:40] <toddmparker> nice. should be a simple copy paste job
[11:53:50] <agcolom> thanks again ajpiano for helping me with that local setup :-)
[11:53:54] <toddmparker> so she can look at then once the API stuff is wrapped up
[11:54:05] <toddmparker> i need to get setup again. new machine.
[11:54:08] <agcolom> yep!
[11:54:25] <toddmparker> ok, great. thanks ajpiano and scott_gonzalez for you help there
[11:55:12] <toddmparker> ok, uGoMobi - want to go?
[11:55:16] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:55:22] <toddmparker> wait, agcolom - you had news??
[11:56:47] <toddmparker> think it's this - "Will talk at jQuery Europe!!! (Good UI design with jQuery Mobile) my aim is to illustrate all good UI design rules with JQM examples. "
[11:56:53] <toddmparker> nice. i'll be there too
[11:56:55] <toddmparker> ok, uGoMobi
[11:57:09] <uGoMobi> worked on panel mostly
[11:57:22] <toddmparker> thanks for cranking on that
[11:57:26] <toddmparker> re:
[11:57:28] <toddmparker> I am in favor of making swipe on page content close the panel too + we need to take the swipe direction into account
[11:57:29] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5458
[11:57:30] <b-ot> toddmparker, issue #5458 by luc-ass (1d 12h ago): New Panels not disappearing when swipe begins on actual page
[11:57:36] <toddmparker> +1 on all counts
[11:57:40] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:57:46] <uGoMobi> I will make the chance
[11:57:54] <uGoMobi> change*
[11:58:11] <uGoMobi> so the issues that have been reported after beta have been fixed
[11:58:18] <toddmparker> nice
[11:58:30] <uGoMobi> lot of people ask for page and panel to scroll independantly
[11:58:38] <toddmparker> might be cool to add the swipe to open as part of these demos:
[11:58:40] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form.html
[11:58:54] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form-fixed.html
[11:59:13] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: the scrolling thing is cool, but chock full of bugginess
[11:59:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: isnt that pretty bad onm android?
[11:59:28] <uGoMobi> I know
[11:59:33] <toddmparker> I think we need to wait until we have a nice qualified scrolling solution in the library and add it then
[11:59:45] <toddmparker> it's a bag of hurt
[11:59:46] <uGoMobi> I agree.. just mention it
[11:59:53] <toddmparker> yeah, i saw those too
[12:00:07] <toddmparker> i think i had scrolling in 1.5
[12:00:26] <arschmitz> a demo might be good for people who want iOS only
[12:00:36] <toddmparker> sure, a demo would be cool
[12:00:41] <uGoMobi> and yes we can ass code example to those panel demos to show how you can open panel with swipe
[12:00:51] <uGoMobi> add
[12:00:53] <uGoMobi> not ass
[12:00:55] <uGoMobi> :/
[12:00:58] <toddmparker> think android 4+ and BB playbook so a decent job too
[12:01:10] <toddmparker> POTTY MOUTH
[12:01:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:01:27] <toddmparker> that swipe to open is a quick one but is really nice
[12:01:43] <uGoMobi> there was a comment in the code
[12:01:50] <uGoMobi> if we should add swipe to open
[12:01:56] <arschmitz> toddmparker: scrolling looks like its a 1.4 "stretch" item on roadmap
[12:02:00] <toddmparker> we also might want to see if we need to add any more panel pages to test combinations of fixed headers, panels, etc.
[12:02:01] <uGoMobi> but that won't work
[12:02:08] <toddmparker> arschmitz: ok, cool
[12:02:13] <uGoMobi> you need to know which panel to open if more than one on the page
[12:02:40] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: was thinking if open and wipe it would close
[12:02:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I changed the demo with fixed toolbars to fixed panel
[12:02:54] <toddmparker> if both are closed, swipe L>R opens the left panel
[12:03:01] <toddmparker> swipe R>L opens right panel
[12:03:09] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good call on that change
[12:03:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: what if you have 3 right panels
[12:03:13] <arschmitz> lol
[12:03:21] <uGoMobi> exactly
[12:03:22] <toddmparker> that's why it needs to be a demo arschmitz
[12:03:26] <uGoMobi> see our docs page
[12:03:31] <uGoMobi> 3 left and 3 right
[12:03:39] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:03:39] <toddmparker> we can have just 1 or 2 panels and map the swipe to each one
[12:03:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: oh ok gotcha
[12:03:53] <toddmparker> yeah, i want to add this to here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form-fixed.html
[12:03:59] <toddmparker> not the docs page
[12:04:07] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:04:21] <toddmparker> and that's why it can't be a baked in behavior
[12:04:31] <uGoMobi> yup
[12:05:05] <toddmparker> curious to see if the swipe threshold is good enough or if scrolling sloppily will open/close it
[12:05:24] <uGoMobi> we have arschmitz his swipe fix
[12:05:34] <toddmparker> true
[12:05:37] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix/blob/master/swipefix.js
[12:05:50] <uGoMobi> we can add it there
[12:05:56] <toddmparker> be good to have a demo of that so sure
[12:05:58] <arschmitz> yeah with out something like that ios will always swipe if you "drift" while scrolling
[12:06:20] <toddmparker> right. scrolling w/your thumb especially. it's more of an arc
[12:06:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: exactly
[12:06:35] <toddmparker> cool kids use their thumbs
[12:06:52] <toddmparker> so arschmitz - want to go?
[12:06:55] <arschmitz> sure
[12:07:12] <arschmitz> triaging 1.3 issues as they came in
[12:07:18] <arschmitz> helped with panels some
[12:07:19] <toddmparker> (thanks)
[12:08:01] <arschmitz> have been doing a LOT of research and speedtesting with _|Nix|_: about creating dom nodes
[12:08:15] <toddmparker> yeah, that is good stuff
[12:08:29] <toddmparker> saw that latest PR might not work out
[12:08:36] <arschmitz> looks like there are some oppertunities to speed things up a bit but still more to be done
[12:08:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i think that ones is going to be a no go sadly
[12:08:55] <toddmparker> sure
[12:09:20] <toddmparker> as you and gabriel go, be good to start sketching out bigger re-factor/consistency ideas for 1.4
[12:09:34] <arschmitz> tracked down and fixed the tocuh event failures in 1.9
[12:09:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah this is actually in a round about way part of that
[12:10:02] <arschmitz> its already helping to speed up a few widgets
[12:10:05] <arschmitz> in testing
[12:10:45] <toddmparker> let's start throwing together a lis tot potential 1.4 ideas
[12:10:45] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-planning
[12:11:01] <arschmitz> i also exposed the resetActivePageHeight function from navigation so it can be used in panel
[12:11:07] <toddmparker> cool
[12:11:19] <arschmitz> it also now accepts a param to use something other then getScreenHeight()
[12:11:31] <toddmparker> that's a nice change
[12:11:49] <arschmitz> yeah helped fix an issue with panels in a consistant manner
[12:11:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: should we move the function to core.js
[12:11:58] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:12:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes probably
[12:12:39] <arschmitz> and one last kinda 1.4 relatd thing started looking at using widget outside pages
[12:13:01] <toddmparker> +1000
[12:13:11] <arschmitz> made a super quick hack and slash version the allows navbars buttons toolbars and fixedtoolbars all to work outside pages
[12:13:18] <toddmparker> great
[12:13:23] <arschmitz> this is going to be a lot of work to do it right
[12:13:29] <arschmitz> but i think its worth it for sure
[12:13:36] <uGoMobi> we have to come up with an idea for nested listviews
[12:13:47] <toddmparker> people really want to be able to re-use a widget like a navbar or popup across pages too - worth thinking about that too
[12:13:55] <gseguin> I have one: get rid of it
[12:13:55] <toddmparker> once of the major reasons to use it outside a page
[12:14:02] <uGoMobi> lol gseguin
[12:14:03] <toddmparker> +1000000000
[12:14:03] <uGoMobi> +1
[12:14:31] <arschmitz> +!
[12:14:36] <arschmitz> +1
[12:14:37] <toddmparker> let's seriously gig thought to whether we should deprecate in 1.4
[12:15:02] <toddmparker> so with 1.5, we can not worry about it
[12:15:21] <arschmitz> on that note pushstate for ios4?
[12:15:30] <toddmparker> i tried killing 'em in beta 1.0 and some squeaky wheels made me back down
[12:15:49] <toddmparker> if it's buggy, iOS4 can have uglier URLs
[12:15:57] <arschmitz> if we kick it down hash only it makes nav simplier  and cleaner
[12:16:10] <toddmparker> still works, just isn't as pretty
[12:16:15] <arschmitz> exactly
[12:16:18] <toddmparker> iOS4 has ~10% share now
[12:16:23] <arschmitz> and ios4 is pretty fringe these days
[12:16:24] <toddmparker> I'm ok with that
[12:16:25] <uGoMobi> same for android 4+
[12:16:31] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: heh
[12:16:34] <uGoMobi> as johnbender mentioned
[12:16:45] <uGoMobi> it's isn't working
[12:16:49] <toddmparker> it's a matter of trajectory
[12:17:03] <toddmparker> Android 4 has issues
[12:17:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: kinda it tracks history properly just doesnt update url untill refresh
[12:17:19] <arschmitz> so messed up
[12:17:20] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:17:24] <toddmparker> ugh
[12:17:30] <toddmparker> B grade!
[12:17:37] <uGoMobi> -1
[12:17:44] <toddmparker> :)
[12:17:44] <arschmitz> ha ha android 2.3+ gets down to be lol
[12:19:21] <arschmitz> thats all for me
[12:19:39] <toddmparker> thanks
[12:19:51] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck?
[12:20:04] <toddmparker> gseguin?
[12:20:05] <RWhitbeck> hey sorry on a call.
[12:20:13] <toddmparker> np
[12:20:16] <gseguin> yep
[12:20:23] <toddmparker> gseguin: floor is yours
[12:20:35] * gseguin starts a dance move
[12:20:44] <toddmparker> niiice
[12:20:44] <RWhitbeck> from agenda
[12:20:45] <RWhitbeck> Working on jQuery Mobile training for jQuery UK
[12:20:46] <RWhitbeck> Giving a jQuery Mobile session at BlackBerry Jam in Amsterdam Feb 5-6
[12:21:01] <toddmparker> thanks RWhitbeck
[12:21:14] <gseguin> some progress on the grunt migration
[12:21:16] <RWhitbeck> Todd are you planning on speaking in Toronto?
[12:21:27] <toddmparker> gseguin: on the download builder, i think it's worth trying to make that easier for folks
[12:21:31] <gseguin> I'm slow as I'm also learning grunt
[12:21:35] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: nope, can't make that
[12:21:38] <toddmparker> Vienna is next for me
[12:21:40] <gseguin> toddmparker: absolutely
[12:21:47] <RWhitbeck> ok I'll make sure JQM is covered there then.
[12:21:56] <toddmparker> re: Who can help putting them on the CDN after that’s done?
[12:22:05] <gseguin> I wrote a blob which you need to proof and I'll push it
[12:22:08] <toddmparker> johnbender: must know how to do that since it's part of the deploy
[12:22:40] <toddmparker> Q: if the files are on the CDn, could we just package them in the zip?
[12:23:09] <gseguin> hmmm that's a good question
[12:23:25] <gseguin> I'll work with Bender when he's back
[12:23:40] <toddmparker> maybe we can push up the individual images you need as part of the deploy and the builder can just grab those when packaging
[12:23:43] <gseguin> I was planning on checking out each branch
[12:23:45] <toddmparker> cool
[12:23:50] <gseguin> and build the dist.zip
[12:23:57] <gseguin> then extract the images out
[12:24:01] <toddmparker> i see. that could work too
[12:24:12] <gseguin> then hand the zip to johnbender for upload on cdn
[12:24:20] <toddmparker> after 1.4, we won't have images
[12:24:29] <toddmparker> actually, not true
[12:24:29] <gseguin> then I can easily generate a dynamic link on the builder page
[12:24:44] <toddmparker> we ail have pangs as a fallback for the svgs
[12:24:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: cant wait for that
[12:25:01] <toddmparker> gonna be hot
[12:25:26] <gseguin> that's it for me
[12:25:54] <gseguin> sorry still on a limited assignment so progress is slow
[12:25:58] <toddmparker> see this? http://andymatthews.net/read/2013/01/16/Build-custom-icon-fonts-with-Builder-for-jQuery-Mobile-Icon-Pack
[12:26:18] <toddmparker> gseguin: that's ok. just good to have some time, esp for download builder
[12:26:27] <toddmparker> ok, think that's it
[12:26:58] <toddmparker> oh, we need to talk about 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 timing
[12:27:03] <toddmparker> let's do that in -dev
[12:27:13] <gseguin> andy's stuff is neat indeed
[12:27:14] <toddmparker> any questions from the community?
[12:29:13] <toddmparker> alright, thanks all!
