[08:58:52] <JohnResig> hey everyone!
[09:00:22] <ajpiano> heya
[09:00:46] <JohnResig> let me get the google doc ready
[09:01:29] <ajpiano> donno who else is around... sup ben_alman danheberden gnarf jitter_ (THROWBACK) jzaefferer kswedberg paul_irish rwaldron timmywil
[09:01:41] <ajpiano> ;)
[09:02:00] <danheberden> i'm looming ominously over the chat room
[09:02:08] <paul_irish> same
[09:02:13] <kswedberg> hey hey
[09:02:13] <bot-t> (65 hours 30 mins ago) <jaubourg> tell kswedberg seems like we completely forgot to talk about ?? as an alternative to =? to specify jsonp callbacks in URLs on the ajax doc page :/
[09:02:20] <rwaldron> i'm here
[09:02:26] <rwaldron> hello everyone
[09:02:30] <ikertxu> here 2
[09:02:57] <ajpiano> no dave
[09:02:59] <ajpiano> :(
[09:03:42] <kswedberg> any agenda?
[09:03:51] <josephseraos> join #jquery
[09:03:53] <ajpiano> i think JohnResig is about to post it
[09:04:00] <JohnResig> pretty much just wondering if anyone is having any issues with 1.7 or random bugs
[09:04:30] <JohnResig> (I updated the google doc)
[09:05:20] <kswedberg> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit?hl=en_US
[09:05:27] <ajpiano> hmm @ docs#9823
[09:05:28] <bot-t> [#9823] IE 8 crashes when using background-image on BODY in css (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/9823
[09:06:22] <JohnResig> oh, heh, ok, we can fix that
[09:06:47] <JohnResig> k, blocker for 1.7
[09:07:13] <ajpiano> are we gonna even do a 1.6.3 ?
[09:07:27] <JohnResig> dunno - we could if we want
[09:07:37] <JohnResig> guess it depends upon the time frame we want to set here
[09:08:24] <ajpiano> we should take stock of what's been fixed/could be fixed since 1.6.2
[09:08:42] <JohnResig> probably not much, I suspect
[09:09:09] <JohnResig> (checking now)
[09:10:12] <Cleber> test
[09:10:17] <ajpiano> hello Cleber
[09:10:28] <ajpiano> your test worked, just a quiet meeting today :)
[09:10:39] <JohnResig> ajpiano: 3 closed & fixed bugs for 1.6.3 so far
[09:10:54] <ajpiano> hm
[09:11:00] <Cleber> ohh thanks for your feedback =)
[09:11:02] <ajpiano> we're not thinking of 1.7 till at least octoboer
[09:11:04] <ajpiano> right?
[09:11:09] <JohnResig> right, for the conf
[09:11:10] <JohnResig> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=closed&component=!web&resolution=fixed&milestone=1.6.3&group=component&max=250&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&report=4&order=id
[09:11:52] <rwaldron> that's cool
[09:11:58] <rwaldron> i was actually hoping that was the case
[09:12:07] <rwaldron> 1.7 will be a fun release
[09:12:13] <rwaldron> good for the conference
[09:12:23] <JohnResig> we could fix some 1.7 blocker bugs for 1.6.3
[09:12:26] <ajpiano> hmm, if we do the body background fix as well and see what else crops up, would a late august 1.6.3 be a good idea or overkill
[09:12:29] <JohnResig> and get it out at the end of august
[09:12:32] <JohnResig> yep
[09:12:33] <ajpiano> lol
[09:13:15] <rwaldron> JohnResig absolutely
[09:13:27] <JohnResig> ok! so anything else?
[09:13:32] <JohnResig> I think that sounds like a good plan
[09:13:41] <rwaldron> 1.6.3 fo' sho
[09:13:42] <ajpiano> yeah,m i'm just looking at http://bugs.jquery.com/query?priority=blocker&status=%21closed&report=5&order=priority
[09:13:54] <ajpiano> to see if anything there seems like it should be retargeted for 1.6.3
[09:14:11] <addyosmani_> when you say release out at the end of august, is that the RC + a week/longer for testing, JohnResig or the final?.
[09:14:22] <rwaldron> ajpiano i'll go through as well
[09:14:27] <rwaldron> give you some back up on that
[09:14:33] <ajpiano> docs#6150 and docs#6652 seem worth it
[09:14:34] <bot-t> [#6150] .stop sometimes doesn't clear .delay (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/6150
[09:14:35] <bot-t> [#6652] Remove filter:alpha(opacity=100) after animation (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/6652
[09:14:46] <JohnResig> addyosmani_: I think release at end of august, so at least a week for RC before that
[09:15:17] <ajpiano> ?9521
[09:15:18] <JohnResig> ajpiano: agreed
[09:15:18] <bot-t> [#9521] XSS with $(location.hash) and $(#<tag>) is needed? (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9521
[09:15:33] <JohnResig> good call, let's retarget all of those
[09:15:39] <JohnResig> (I'm on it)
[09:15:42] <ajpiano> coo'
[09:15:53] <addyosmani_> cool JohnResig
[09:16:11] <ajpiano> my last q would be if you think docs#9895 would be worth retargeting as well
[09:16:13] <bot-t> [#9895] Memory Leak in fxqueue (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9895
[09:16:38] <ajpiano> ooh and docs#9413
[09:16:40] <bot-t> [#9413] $.fn.removeData does not remove data with a dash in a name ( remove ""fooBar"" instead.) - http://jqbug.com/9413
[09:17:15] <JohnResig> yep again
[09:17:19] <JohnResig> there we go, good pile :)
[09:17:22] <ajpiano> woot
[09:17:33] <ajpiano> everything else seems tied to a larger feature or code reorg
[09:18:02] <ajpiano> or is a new feature :p
[09:18:23] <mbains007> Hi all
[09:18:33] <JohnResig> so is that it?
[09:18:34] <ajpiano> heya mbains007, we're just wrapping up here it seems
[09:18:40] <rwaldron> ajpiano 9413 is part of a series of data() fixes I'm working on
[09:18:44] <rwaldron> some blocking others
[09:18:46] <mbains007> dammit!
[09:18:51] <ajpiano> rwaldron: i figured as much
[09:19:03] <rwaldron> the ones doing the blocking are waiting in the pull request queue :\
[09:19:17] <mbains007> Is hardware acceleration for 1.7 still on track?
[09:19:49] <addyosmani_> If anyone requires docs related help for 1.6.3, I'm happy to pitch in. Doubt there's a lot given the current queue :)
[09:20:00] <ajpiano> i don't think hardware acceleration was ever on track, mbains007
[09:20:31] <ajpiano> paul_irish and i were tlaking about it abstractly with wycats at TXJS
[09:20:52] <mbains007> @ajpiano: hmmm... I was under the assumption that it was going to be done by taking advantage of CSS3 browser support...
[09:21:27] <ajpiano> what put you under that assumption ?
[09:21:45] <paul_irish> concievably..
[09:21:49] <paul_irish> in the meantime there is http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[09:22:01] <mbains007> here under 1.7 http://bugs.jquery.com/roadmap
[09:22:14] <ajpiano> oh gawd
[09:22:22] <ajpiano> that is horribly inaccurate :/
[09:22:25] <paul_irish> :p
[09:22:31] <ajpiano> sorry about that mbains007
[09:22:39] <paul_irish> i wrote those like right after 1.5 shipped or something
[09:23:00] <mbains007> lol, no worries
[09:23:01] <JohnResig> this is why we can't have nice things, haha
[09:23:10] <ben_alman> guess i missed everything
[09:23:10] <addyosmani_> alternatives to barnett's work here, mbains007 http://addyosmani.com/blog/css3transitions-jquery/. More than enough out there to help for now.
[09:23:41] <ajpiano> i'm revising that section now
[09:23:50] <ajpiano> removing everything but HTML5 element support
[09:23:57] <ajpiano> and adding the event rewrite
[09:24:26] <mbains007> thanks, addy. ajpiano - this could do with an update - still states that 1.8.13 is the latest stable build http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137947/FrontPage I thought 1.8.14 was?
[09:24:56] <ajpiano> you are correct
[09:25:39] <addyosmani_> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/06/jquery-ui-1-8-14/ if anyone wants to edit/update
[09:25:51] <ajpiano> yeah was fixing right now and grabbing that lnk tx addyosmani_
[09:25:55] <JohnResig> I gotta run - ttyl all!
[09:26:06] <addyosmani_> later JohnResig
[09:26:10] <mbains007> How's the grid and tooltip projects coming along. I'm having to resort to using JQueryTools for tooltips and a streamlined version of this grid plugin http://tablesorter.com/docs/#Demo
[09:26:19] <mbains007> bye John!
[09:26:38] <ajpiano> mbains007: this just the jQuery Core meeting
[09:26:48] <addyosmani_> You may find it useful asking about the status of those projects at the jQuery UI dev meeting, mbains007. That said, their wiki generally has a weekly update on where things are.
[09:26:49] <ajpiano> we have a UI and then a UI Grid meeting in here on wednesday at the same time
[09:26:52] <ajpiano> you should check back
[09:27:32] <addyosmani_> ^what the man with the formidable hair said.
[09:27:34] <ajpiano> tooltip is in pretty good shape
[09:27:34] <addyosmani_> :)
[09:27:58] <ajpiano> and the grid is progressing, but still a lot of work to do on a bunch of new widgets that will be used in the grid (and outside)
[09:28:11] <ajpiano> but yeah, come on back on wednesday to talk about that
[09:28:27] <mbains007> ok, will check in on Wednesday, aplogies for going off track
[09:28:36] <ajpiano> no problemo, just gonna wrap up now
[09:28:45] <ajpiano> ok folks, good meeting :) catchya in -dev :)
[09:28:51] <mbains007> bye all!
