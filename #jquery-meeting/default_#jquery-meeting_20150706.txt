[09:01:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, markelog, m_gol, arthurvr meeting dawgs
[09:01:54] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:01:55] <arthurvr> hey
[09:02:05] <timmywil> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BadwSO6Sn91RBfr05s77r81ncEi0oMBJ5mZS-k215vg/edit#
[09:02:16] <timmywil> also gnarf
[09:03:08] <timmywil> So, we've got a few things to do before we can release
[09:03:20] <m_gol> present
[09:03:37] <timmywil> The blockers are all either done or have PRs for review, so they just need to be resolved.
[09:04:02] <timmywil> We still have some failures in IE8 we'll need to fix
[09:04:34] <markelog> i would like to present another back-incompatible change
[09:04:44] <timmywil> And I need to look over the blog post again, hopefully with DaveMethvin if he's got time.
[09:04:44] <markelog> we didn't discuss it
[09:04:52] <timmywil> markelog: sure, what's that?
[09:05:02] <markelog> jsonp callbacks
[09:05:06] <markelog> long story :-)
[09:05:12] <markelog> will tell more in pr
[09:05:12] <timmywil> Is there an issue open?
[09:05:16] <timmywil> ok
[09:05:21] <markelog> cool
[09:05:51] <timmywil> There's one issue for review https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2435
[09:06:21] <markelog> why not use bind?
[09:06:27] <timmywil> I'm inclined to not change the jQuery() code to accomodate this case
[09:06:37] <timmywil> bind seems fine
[09:06:49] <markelog> oh, it seems Scott suggested the same thing )
[09:06:54] <timmywil> that's probably I would do in my own code, for any library I was using
[09:07:02] <timmywil> what* I would do
[09:07:09] <markelog> yeah, -1 too
[09:07:10] <m_gol> +1
[09:07:17] <m_gol> I mean, +1 for rejecting ;)
[09:07:21] <timmywil> :)
[09:08:01] <timmywil> I just opened a PR today for .catch
[09:08:12] <timmywil> and that other issue I had turned out not to be a blocker
[09:08:41] <timmywil> we have some lively discussion on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2439, tho
[09:08:53] <markelog> yeah, that code style discussion now is up again )
[09:09:02] <markelog> lets changed it!
[09:09:03] <timmywil> that too
[09:09:04] <markelog> hate it!
[09:09:09] <markelog> can't stand it!
[09:09:16] <m_gol> I actually like it :P
[09:09:25] <markelog> oh nooooo
[09:09:34] <markelog> )
[09:09:36] <timmywil> uhoh, m_gol, why'd you say that
[09:09:41] <timmywil> ;)
[09:09:59] <markelog> we can reopen that discussion in contribute repo
[09:10:15] <markelog> plus there is a gibson042 pr to jscs
[09:10:18] <m_gol> I don't like exceptions, they make me wonder what's right
[09:10:32] <markelog> for grouping parentheses
[09:11:04] <timmywil> m_gol: once we start formatting the code, you won't have to wonder about exceptions tho
[09:11:16] <markelog> true that
[09:11:26] <timmywil> it's just about what you'd rather read
[09:11:45] <markelog> funny thing, you could easily do jscs -x ...
[09:11:49] <markelog> with google preset
[09:11:51] <markelog> for example
[09:11:56] <m_gol> I'd prefer to read `( function` than `(function`
[09:12:00] <markelog> do you fix
[09:12:05] <markelog> close your eyes
[09:12:09] <m_gol> I don't have a strng opinion on `} )` vs `})` except consistency
[09:12:13] <markelog> do the jscs -x ... again with jquery preset
[09:12:15] <markelog> and commit )
[09:12:59] <timmywil> markelog: while that works for reading it, I don't think that's plausible for me during development because I do git status as I go
[09:13:00] <markelog> basically if you don't like any code style, you can always do the autofix thing
[09:13:22] <timmywil> git diff I mean
[09:13:24] <markelog> oh, yeah )
[09:13:55] <markelog> although, you can do autofix, then commit, do you fix, autofix again, then commit, then rebase and squash
[09:13:58] <markelog> ))
[09:14:25] <timmywil> we can discuss this in an email or on an issue. I'd like to resolve the fractional width/height first.
[09:15:26] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2439
[09:16:14] <m_gol> you know where I stand ;)
[09:16:31] <timmywil> markelog: you seem against this change, but I'm not sure it would break as much as you think. We've had several requests for returning fractions when the browser returns fractions.
[09:16:33] <markelog> yeah, about that, sometimes i can sound very categoric in my statements but i really do not trying to be arrogant
[09:16:53] <m_gol> I think it's worth a try
[09:16:54] <markelog> i remember when jdalton send me letter about that )
[09:17:24] <timmywil> what did he say?
[09:17:25] <markelog> timmywil: if you guys sure about it, then we should do it
[09:17:27] <m_gol> especially that it's not that we're consistent for fractional values currently
[09:18:06] <markelog> timmywil: that i was a very expressive )
[09:18:20] <timmywil> ohh
[09:18:21] <timmywil> :)
[09:18:25] <m_gol> browsers couldn't change it because people e.g. use the output as class names
[09:18:39] <m_gol> but if devs do it & it breaks with the jQuery upgrade it's easy to fix
[09:18:45] <timmywil> wow, they do?
[09:18:57] <m_gol> that's what bzbarsky said ;)
[09:19:05] <markelog> timmywil: i'm scared that chrome and ff actually try that with DOM methods
[09:19:09] <timmywil> I'd be nervous about doing that
[09:19:11] <markelog> and had to revert those commits
[09:19:26] <m_gol> yes, because of existing sites that got broken
[09:19:36] <m_gol> that won't happen just because we release a new jQuery ;)
[09:19:56] <markelog> yeah, but people really would want to update
[09:20:00] <markelog> or defer that
[09:20:13] <timmywil> we can always try it for alpha and back out later
[09:20:19] <gibson042> I second that
[09:20:21] <markelog> yeah
[09:20:45] <m_gol> yes but it's a conscious choice so the dev can fix everything before deploying, that's the difference
[09:20:47] <markelog> m_gol: problem there
[09:20:53] <markelog> is people might update to new jquery
[09:20:54] <timmywil> ok cool
[09:20:58] <markelog> wouldn't notice the bug
[09:21:05] <markelog> because it would be very edgy
[09:21:19] <markelog> then, they will blame us for it
[09:21:27] <m_gol> that concern applies to any breaking change
[09:21:36] <markelog> not exactly
[09:21:43] <markelog> if breaking change is seen
[09:21:46] <markelog> like method rename
[09:21:48] <markelog> then yes
[09:21:56] <markelog> but if breaking change only seen in edge cases
[09:21:59] <markelog> then no
[09:22:05] <timmywil> ok, well, we'll see how it goes
[09:22:25] <m_gol> I can prepare a version for compat, probably today
[09:22:34] <markelog> also
[09:22:42] <markelog> we need a change for the migrate
[09:22:44] <m_gol> I'm going on vacation on Thursday for a week so I have to get it ready today or tomorrow
[09:22:52] <m_gol> yes, I'll open a ticket
[09:22:53] <markelog> if result is subpixel
[09:22:54] <timmywil> markelog: good call
[09:22:56] <markelog> round it up
[09:23:00] <m_gol> or down
[09:23:02] <m_gol> :wink"
[09:23:06] <markelog> :))))
[09:23:17] <timmywil> m_gol: thanks
[09:23:34] <markelog> m_gol: where do you go?
[09:23:43] <timmywil> I'll take a look at the animation fails in IE8.
[09:24:15] <m_gol> markelog: https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Hel/
[09:24:52] <timmywil> you're vacationing in Hel?
[09:24:58] <timmywil> sounds dangerous
[09:24:58] <markelog> )))))
[09:25:08] <markelog> nice
[09:25:28] <markelog> what country is it?
[09:25:40] <markelog> oh,
[09:25:43] <markelog> Poland
[09:26:14] <markelog> looks fantastic!
[09:26:17] <markelog> jealous )
[09:26:27] <timmywil> Thanks everyone for your help getting this release out. I'll be working on that for the better part of today and possibly tomorrow.
[09:26:28] <markelog> side note
[09:26:42] <markelog> we discuss switching to gitter?
[09:26:46] <markelog> did*
[09:26:54] <timmywil> we didn't
[09:27:00] <markelog> perhaps we should
[09:27:06] <markelog> timmywil: did you try it?
[09:27:08] <m_gol> I like IRC
[09:27:13] <timmywil> I haven't
[09:27:14] <m_gol> it gets archived on our servers
[09:27:37] <m_gol> we'd need to have sth like that or we'd start relying on outside logs
[09:27:56] <markelog> m_gol: perhaps gitter could that too?
[09:28:18] <m_gol> maybe
[09:28:29] <markelog> i suggest we would do the next meeting there, try it out
[09:28:44] <timmywil> I don't have a problem with IRC. What are the advantages?
[09:28:55] <markelog> github integration is amazing
[09:29:09] <markelog> it is hard to explain :-)
[09:29:19] <timmywil> ok, I'll take a closer look
[09:29:26] <markelog> okay, cool
[09:29:53] <markelog> timmywil: you can go to https://gitter.im/jscs-dev/node-jscs
[09:30:06] <markelog> just to try it out
[09:30:27] <timmywil> will do
[09:30:32] <m_gol> as for my PR - I'll prepare the compat version, probaly today, when can I merge them both? it needs to be before Thursday
[09:30:33] <timmywil> thanks everbody! see you in -dev
[09:30:44] <timmywil> m_gol: whenever you're ready
[09:30:51] <m_gol> when do we want to release?
[09:30:58] <m_gol> we talked about July 6 before ;)
[09:31:06] <timmywil> yea, that's still possible, but probably tomorrow
[09:31:11] <m_gol> k
