[09:08:06] <DaveMethvin> SORRY!
[09:08:34] <DaveMethvin> m_gol gibson042 timmywil rwaldron gnarf and others
[09:08:45] <DaveMethvin> somehow i lost track of time
[09:08:50] <m_gol> present
[09:08:52] <m_gol> :)
[09:09:00] <m_gol> lots of lots of testing problems today...
[09:09:07] <DaveMethvin> well at least i had made up the agenda ...
[09:09:10] <m_gol> I've noticed a weekly test was running for 6 days
[09:09:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw
[09:09:21] <mikesherov_> here
[09:09:22] <DaveMethvin> thanks for working with BS on that
[09:09:24] <m_gol> keeping UI, Core, Migrate etc. tests in line
[09:09:28] <m_gol> that worries me
[09:09:34] <m_gol> we have a timeout plugin enabled in Jenkins
[09:09:42] <m_gol> and timeout set in our testswarm invocation
[09:09:49] <m_gol> and apparently both do nothing :(
[09:10:05] <DaveMethvin> at least they don't time anything out!
[09:10:36] <m_gol> I've removed Android 4.0 from the weekly build temporarily
[09:10:51] <m_gol> since it was spawning zombie Android Kindle Fire HD machines that were draining the pool
[09:10:59] <m_gol> and added 4.3 + 4.4 that are now available
[09:11:05] <m_gol> I've missed it before since they're not in Live
[09:11:18] <m_gol> apparently Live only has emulators while Automate has real devices
[09:11:19] <m_gol> weird
[09:11:27] <DaveMethvin> the browserstack guys need some sort of rss feed for their updates
[09:11:30] <DaveMethvin> or could use twitter i guess
[09:11:38] <DaveMethvin> but a lot of stuff happens without us finding out
[09:11:38] <m_gol> BrowserStack also removed all iOS <6.1 from automate :( :( :(
[09:11:44] <m_gol> and we tested on 5.1, 6.0 & 7.0
[09:12:12] <m_gol> so I've changed it to 6.1 & 7.0 & dumped 5.1 (it was only tested in the weekly run "so that we know", we don't support it officially)
[09:12:18] <DaveMethvin> what's the market share of devices still running those i wonder
[09:12:25] <m_gol> but still there are errors with Android 4.1 & 2.3...
[09:12:39] <m_gol> 2.3 is weird, it just keeps staying in the queue doing nothing
[09:12:55] <m_gol> while 4.1 gets stuck on a screen inviting the user to log in to Google :D
[09:13:16] <m_gol> so we have a mess now
[09:13:36] <DaveMethvin> arrrgh
[09:13:45] <gibson042> "now". I like your glass-half-full outlook, m_gol
[09:13:53] <DaveMethvin> that's why we have a weekly job when you think about it tho
[09:13:54] <m_gol> ]:->
[09:14:00] <m_gol> at least it's not draining the pool like 4.0 did
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> all the platforms that give us trouble
[09:14:05] <m_gol> it does timeout after a while
[09:14:38] <m_gol> I have an impression we have too many tools in the pipeline
[09:14:54] <DaveMethvin> feel free to update the bullets in the agenda m_gol, just don't make it seem too sad :)
[09:14:54] <m_gol> Jenkins -> TestSwarm -> testswarm-browserstack -> node-browserstack -> actual BrowserStack
[09:15:11] <DaveMethvin> no wonder that stuff never works
[09:15:14] <m_gol> and then we're playing a game "guess where sth broke"
[09:15:14] <DaveMethvin> too many cooks!
[09:15:35] <m_gol> and imagine the joy on my face when I get an error with a helpful field `err: {}`
[09:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> hint: It's never node-browserstack :-P
[09:15:37] <DaveMethvin> and none of them with very good cooking habits
[09:15:40] <m_gol> ;)
[09:15:54] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:16:05] <m_gol> [Mon, 14 Jul 2014 12:58:13 GMT] action=warning {"message":"Spawn error for browser","info":{"browser":{"browser_version":null,"os":"android","device":"Samsung Galaxy S 2","browser":null,"os_version":"2.3"},"err":{}}}
[09:16:05] <m_gol> [
[09:16:12] <mikesherov_> so testswarm is in the mix because it, what... keeps the results for display?
[09:16:15] <m_gol> I read it "TRY ME NOW"
[09:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: yeah
[09:16:48] <m_gol> mikersherov_: Sizzle is now on Karma, we're planning to switch the rest, too, but there are problems on the way so it's not so fast
[09:16:49] <mikesherov_> but now that we have Travis?
[09:16:52] <DaveMethvin> "os_version":"2.3"   <---- THERE IS YOUR PROBLEM
[09:16:58] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:17:00] <mikesherov_> I see
[09:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> We can't use Travis for a weekly job.
[09:17:15] <mikesherov_> so use Karma as the runner, and where are the histortical results kept?
[09:17:17] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: [Mon, 14 Jul 2014 13:03:24 GMT] action=warning {"message":"Spawn error for browser","info":{"browser":{"os":"ios","browser_version":null,"device":"iPhone 5S","browser":null,"os_version":"7.0"},"err":{}}}
[09:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we *could* automate empty commits on a branch...
[09:17:23] <mikesherov_> @scot
[09:17:25] <m_gol> mikesherov_: on Travis
[09:17:28] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: you monster
[09:17:39] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: I thought the same but I was afraid to open my mouth :P
[09:17:44] <DaveMethvin> that's just sick
[09:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> That's why I started with "We can't use Travis"
[09:18:07] <m_gol> ;)
[09:18:13] <DaveMethvin> my toilet needs fixing, let me just jiggle the handle
[09:18:26] <mikesherov_> oh man, I actually replaced my own toilet once
[09:18:32] <mikesherov_> but the problem didn't go away
[09:18:36] <m_gol> even then, shortening that to Jenkins -> Karma -> BrowserStack would probably help
[09:19:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah, might be worth changing up the plumbing on that just to see what is breaking
[09:20:28] <DaveMethvin> funny thing is, nobody seems to ever complain about the bugs we're finding in android
[09:20:36] <DaveMethvin> of course they're probably not testing on android :)
[09:20:38] <mikesherov_> right, and we can always keep the weekly jobs on TestSwarm in the mean time while we move over the actual PR workflow to remove it
[09:22:33] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 on that jquery-migrate fail, i think we may just want to pull the offending test
[09:22:34] <mikesherov_> anywho, sounds like we're plannig that already
[09:23:00] <DaveMethvin> we aren't guaranteeing consistent results since older versions gave different ones on oldIE
[09:23:01] <gibson042> I was looking at that a little bit
[09:23:04] <gibson042> yeah
[09:23:23] <DaveMethvin> ok imma just gonna remove it then
[09:23:34] <gibson042> this comes down to the weirdness of -migrate being bidirectional... what aspects of old versions are preserved vs. updated?
[09:23:39] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:23:50] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we want to change the behavior of old versions
[09:24:12] <gibson042> maybe move it into the 1.9+ block of that test, then
[09:24:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i *think* can do that
[09:24:48] <DaveMethvin> let me see
[09:24:50] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:25:49] <DaveMethvin> let me rearrange the agenda in the order we discuss
[09:26:09] <mikesherov__> .
[09:26:21] <DaveMethvin> so i'll be on vacation later this week
[09:26:23] <m_gol> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez: BrowserStack answered that they now only serve real mobile devices on Automate and they don't have old iOS versions; do we need <6.1 for anything?
[09:26:48] <DaveMethvin> i think that's like first-gen iPad and such? Let's say no
[09:26:56] <m_gol> ok, I'll answer them
[09:27:01] <DaveMethvin> do we have it on any official support lists m_gol ?
[09:27:13] <m_gol> hmm, we have 6.0+
[09:27:31] <m_gol> we might bump it to 6.1, after all every iOS device on 6.0 can be upgraded to 6.1
[09:27:32] <DaveMethvin> are there any devices on 6.0 that couldnt' upgrade to 6.1?
[09:27:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah ok
[09:27:40] <m_gol> and iOS people upgrade pretty quickly
[09:27:52] <DaveMethvin> let's just update our support matrix then
[09:28:03] <DaveMethvin> i mean, it may work with older but it's getting damn hard to test
[09:29:25] <DaveMethvin> so i updated $.xhr and basically incorporated all the comments from the week before
[09:29:48] <DaveMethvin> i think the main remaining issue is what promisey thing we return
[09:29:56] <DaveMethvin> in particular for the built file
[09:30:07] <DaveMethvin> which is what most people will be using
[09:30:34] <DaveMethvin> so getify has what seems to be a pretty tiny shim for Promise
[09:30:47] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only
[09:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> We should talk to Domenic about the return value.
[09:31:15] <mikesherov__> I still Gibson can produce a .4K version of that
[09:31:26] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: return value?
[09:31:37] <gibson042> I may yet get the chance :)
[09:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> Whether tacking an xhr property onto a Promise instance is the best way to go.
[09:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> To expose the additional data.
[09:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> He's been involved in a lot of W3C API design with promises.
[09:32:52] <DaveMethvin> native Promise is still pretty skeletal unfortunately
[09:33:00] <DaveMethvin> which is why ppl are extending it
[09:33:05] <DaveMethvin> and that isn't a good idea
[09:33:40] <DaveMethvin> like i said in that email i'm not even sure Promise is the right paradigm for all of XHR's capabilities
[09:34:08] <DaveMethvin> because it's not a single value delivered in the future
[09:34:47] <DaveMethvin> anyway, as long as there's a callback returning the XHR it can be wrapped any way people want
[09:35:18] <mikesherov__> we can always return an array suitable for .spread too
[09:35:28] <DaveMethvin> markelog said he'd send around his thoughts tomorrow, he's traveling
[09:35:52] <scott_gonzalez> Have any of the Dojo devs chimed in?
[09:36:03] <scott_gonzalez> Or are they planning on ignoring all of our ajax stuff?
[09:36:26] <DaveMethvin> i think they have their own
[09:36:36] <DaveMethvin> the collab was on the dom manip afaict
[09:37:29] <DaveMethvin> ok then let's assume we try the Promise shim
[09:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> We should see if there's potential for collab on ajax if we greatly simplify with $.xhr() and stop using $.Deferred
[09:37:44] <DaveMethvin> and i'll ping domenic
[09:37:58] <DaveMethvin> i'll ask snover
[09:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:38:15] <mikesherov__> someone should reach out to Kyle if he's open to contributions for file size considerations
[09:39:22] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: do you want to do the honrs there?
[09:39:43] <mikesherov__> will do
[09:39:56] <m_gol> how quickly is http://jquery.com/browser-support/ supposed to update? It doesn't pick up my change (I've tagged a new version with iOS 6.0+ bumped to iOS 6.1+)
[09:40:41] <DaveMethvin> sometimes it seems to take a little time
[09:40:49] <DaveMethvin> i had that happen a couple of days ago
[09:41:36] <m_gol> ok
[09:41:42] <m_gol> I was wondering
[09:41:51] <m_gol> should we put *some* info about Android 2.3 in the table?
[09:42:01] <m_gol> I mean it doesn't pass all the test so maybe putting it in the table is too much
[09:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: The deploy failed.
[09:42:19] <m_gol> but we've spent so much time on making it more or less work that it's bad not to mention it at all
[09:42:23] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: why?
[09:42:58] <DaveMethvin> why the deploy failed?
[09:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> Some problem with `npm update`
[09:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> There's an email that gets sent to deploy@jquery.com on every deploy to stage and master.
[09:43:29] <DaveMethvin> that looks bad ... + set -e
[09:43:29] <DaveMethvin> + cd /usr/local/wordpress-repos/jquery.com
[09:43:29] <DaveMethvin> + echo Checking out 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
[09:43:29] <DaveMethvin> + sudo -u jqdeploy git fetch -fup origin '+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*' '+refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*'
[09:43:30] <DaveMethvin> Checking out 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
[09:43:31] <DaveMethvin> + sudo -u jqdeploy git checkout --force 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
[09:43:32] <DaveMethvin> fatal: reference is not a tree: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
[09:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> That was a force push.
[09:43:47] <scott_gonzalez> The deploy script probably doesn't handle that very well.
[09:44:02] <m_gol> force-push? I don't thing I force pushed anything
[09:44:24] <m_gol> when I've noticed it doesn't pick up my change I tried removing the tag and adding it again, maybe that's the "force" part
[09:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, sorry, not a force push. I saw `--force`, but it was for the checkout.
[09:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> Never delete a tag.
[09:45:06] <m_gol> ok
[09:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> Just tag again and see if it works.
[09:45:26] <DaveMethvin> using npm version patch you mean?
[09:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> worked that time
[09:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> 2.0.29 just succeeded.
[09:45:38] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah, that's what I used
[09:45:50] <m_gol> I see the updated page now :)
[09:45:56] <DaveMethvin> probably got caught in some no-mans-land when the tag was temporarily deleted i guess
[09:46:11] <m_gol> but I've deleted it after 5-10 minutes ;)
[09:46:20] <m_gol> it should've got updated in the meantime
[09:46:27] <DaveMethvin> you'd think  :)
[09:46:31] <m_gol> ;)
[09:46:32] <m_gol> ok
[09:46:39] <DaveMethvin> alrighty
[09:46:39] <m_gol> I'll remember to never delete a tag again
[09:46:46] <DaveMethvin> let's see what's left
[09:46:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm hoping we'll get trac fixed
[09:46:59] <m_gol> so what about this Android 2.3 in the table?
[09:47:11] <m_gol> (see what I wrote above)
[09:47:20] <DaveMethvin> i think we want to support it
[09:47:39] <DaveMethvin> so any fails we have we should work on
[09:47:42] <m_gol> but should we add it to the table when it fails 17 tests?
[09:47:50] <m_gol> sure, I mean what should be written there now
[09:47:54] <m_gol> until we fix them
[09:47:59] <DaveMethvin> well nobody has ever reported them
[09:48:06] <DaveMethvin> and if they did they'd be open bugs
[09:48:07] <m_gol> ;)
[09:48:15] <DaveMethvin> so yeah i'd put it on there
[09:48:19] <m_gol> k
[09:48:35] <m_gol> I'll add it
[09:48:41] <m_gol> hopefully successfully this time ;)
[09:48:47] <m_gol> k, back to Trac
[09:48:54] <m_gol> I've seen you contacted sb about this?
[09:49:20] <DaveMethvin> about trac? nacin says he'll help
[09:49:32] <DaveMethvin> and we also have a second person who said they'll help
[09:49:49] <DaveMethvin> gnarf wants to get nacin to write some stuff down so we can do things ourselves
[09:50:00] <DaveMethvin> the main thing will be to get updated to 1.0 i think
[09:50:13] <DaveMethvin> snover said there's a maintenance job that goes haywire and uses up the box
[09:50:21] <DaveMethvin> that might be what is hanging it so often
[09:50:31] <DaveMethvin> the maint job is supposed to run like once a week or something
[09:50:41] <DaveMethvin> but it ends up running several times a day
[09:50:55] <m_gol> ouch
[09:50:56] <DaveMethvin> but step 1 let's get upgraded
[09:51:20] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: have you got nacin set up with what he needs?
[09:51:37] <DaveMethvin> not sure how hard it will be to upgrade our trac from 0.12 to 1.0
[09:51:41] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: no not yet - I was hoping to have a chance to actually talk to him
[09:51:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah ok
[09:51:47] <gnarf> with s5fs
[09:52:20] <DaveMethvin> i guess he'll need access to the bugs box, is that one of our newer ones gnarf or should it be migrated somewhere else?
[09:53:56] <m_gol> (heh, I see even mentions don't work in gists: https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/43ffd1c743554e5c50ae)
[09:54:00] <m_gol> (they're not even linked)
[09:54:14] <DaveMethvin> yep, which sucks
[09:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Yeah, a while ago they removed notifications and mentions. No idea why.
[09:54:57] <m_gol> I keep a Chrome extension to observe every single gist I care about for updates :D
[09:54:58] <m_gol> it sucks
[09:55:12] <DaveMethvin> they could always disable them for private gists, if there was some concern about that
[09:55:24] <DaveMethvin> i just feel bad about not seeing the comments when people make them
[09:55:51] <DaveMethvin> seems too early to do a PR for that, since i never completed or tested the code :)
[09:56:23] <DaveMethvin> had really hoped to get jauborg's input by now as well, i'll see if i can bug him again
[09:56:49] <DaveMethvin> alrighty, i've got to run in just a sec
[09:56:56] <DaveMethvin> any other priority items?
[09:57:20] <DaveMethvin> ok then, see you back in -dev!
