[10:02:45] <arthurvr> hey
[10:03:25] <sfrisk> hope everyone had a good week
[10:04:45] <sfrisk> Okay so we have some stuff potentially read for PR
[10:04:55] <sfrisk> or not PR
[10:04:57] <sfrisk> merging
[10:05:02] <sfrisk> sorry, words are hard
[10:05:17] <arschmitz> ah here
[10:05:17] <sfrisk> We have Typography: Remove overwriting of anchor elements, and Fixed typo and clarity in comment
[10:05:19] <arschmitz> i suck
[10:05:28] <arschmitz> in deep technical discussion lost track of time
[10:05:32] <sfrisk> lol
[10:05:54] <sfrisk> the first PR addresses the concerns brought up in https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/84
[10:06:03] <sfrisk> and the other one is just a typo fix
[10:06:03] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:06:23] <sfrisk> Fixes #81 can be closed since the typography one deals with the concern in that
[10:06:27] <sfrisk> which I shall do now
[10:08:27] <sfrisk> Unless someone sees anything that concerns them in the other two issues, we'll merge those in after the meeitng
[10:10:43] <michaelarestad> LGTM
[10:10:48] * michaelarestad brb
[10:13:19] <sfrisk> hrmm, okay I'll do the table PR discussion after michaelarestad gets back
[10:15:15] <sfrisk> okay, so we still have the performance PRs
[10:15:28] <sfrisk> arschmitz, have you submitted the PR for the colors js thing?
[10:19:36] <arschmitz> no
[10:19:36] <arschmitz> i got distracted ill do it right now
[10:19:36] <sfrisk> okay
[10:19:36] <michaelarestad> back
[10:19:36] <sfrisk> as a heads up to everyone, this should help make customizing chassis either
[10:19:36] <sfrisk> easier*
[10:19:36] <sfrisk> especially with the themeroller that geekman-rohit is working on
[10:19:56] <sfrisk> how are style guides going, slayslot, kristyjy?
[10:21:00] <geekman-rohit> yep, arschmitzs idea is awesome!
[10:21:06] <geekman-rohit> going to help us all a lot
[10:21:21] <kristyjy> SCSS is coming along. Ended up not getting to spend the time I wanted this weekend but I'm going to put some time into it tomorrow and Thursday night. Hopefully I can get a PR up even if it's not everything I hoped to cover
[10:21:53] <sfrisk> if there is parts you want community input on, we could probably do that during the PR
[10:22:34] <arschmitz> so i just submitted it its not ready to land or anything
[10:22:45] <arschmitz> we just wanted feed back on the concept
[10:23:16] <sfrisk> well arthurvr is on it :-)
[10:23:30] <sfrisk> however others should look too
[10:23:51] <sfrisk> I know the color list is based on something rough I told you, I'm gonna look over it and give me more formal ideas
[10:25:48] <arschmitz> lol
[10:26:09] <arschmitz> so no reall need on formatting stuff
[10:26:13] <arschmitz> :-p
[10:27:14] <sfrisk> okay so Table styling
[10:27:20] <sfrisk> how is that going, michealarestad
[10:27:30] <michaelarestad> Haven't touched it. :D
[10:27:51] <michaelarestad> Sorry. I've been out of town and am running a conference this weekend. Then my life returns to normal.
[10:28:04] <michaelarestad> I can probably fix the few things later this week.
[10:28:53] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:29:19] <sfrisk> I am heading out to jQuerySF for June 22/23, where I will be talking about Chassis a bit while I'm out there
[10:29:44] <michaelarestad> Awesome.
[10:29:54] <kristyjy> yay! :)
[10:31:37] <sfrisk> okay so some things that need to get done coming up is form elements, buttons, and form validation states
[10:31:42] <sfrisk> basically all things forms
[10:32:00] <sfrisk> although validation states are slightly dependent on form elements getting done
[10:32:21] <arschmitz> yeah ^^
[10:32:26] <sfrisk> I'm going to make a priority for myself this week to help arschmitz with the colors for the JS thing
[10:32:35] <sfrisk> and I'll work on buttons probably
[10:32:48] <arschmitz> yeah getting that in place sets the foundations for other stuff
[10:36:00] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:36:09] <sfrisk> so if someone wants to pick that stuff up
[10:36:27] <sfrisk> I would like most of that in PRs within the next 2 weeks
[10:38:17] <sfrisk> Okay, welp, that's it on my list for this week, anyone else have anything else they want to discuss?
[10:39:11] <arthurvr> just catching up
[10:39:18] <arthurvr> I didnâ€™t have anything more - thanks sfrisk
[10:41:09] <sfrisk> ohhh
[10:41:10] <sfrisk> wait
[10:41:13] <sfrisk> forgot one thing
[10:41:28] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, do you want to give an update on the themeroller and your work so far at all?
[10:48:01] <sfrisk> hrmm, okay, I guess he's away from the computer
