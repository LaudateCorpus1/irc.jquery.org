[09:00:52] <RTPMatt> hi
[09:01:14] <ajpiano> hey RTPMatt
[09:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's get started
[09:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf has commit access now :-)
[09:03:47] <rworth> \o/
[09:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> he's been helping out a lot with pull requests (and of course effects)
[09:04:31] <ajpiano> awesome!!@!!!
[09:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: infrastructure update?
[09:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't see any email last week
[09:05:13] <danheberden> sry scott_gonzalez on the phone atm - family emergency crap :/
[09:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok, we'll come back to that
[09:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: did you get a chance to review the Silk docs?
[09:05:57] <ajpiano> i read them, yes
[09:06:04] <ajpiano> i should probably write something up
[09:06:13] <rworth> no update from me on docs
[09:06:27] <ajpiano> generally it's good, i was sort of expecting some more content on like, "how"
[09:06:29] <ajpiano> but alas
[09:06:38] <ajpiano> i think we can borrow a lot of the stuff they use to describe the methods, etc.
[09:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it's a decent technical overview
[09:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> but we definitely need an intro walk-through
[09:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> like a tutorial about the colorize widget :-)
[09:08:17] <ajpiano> can you link to colorise again
[09:08:45] <ajpiano> it seems sort of an obtuse example - i feel like we might get more mileage out of explaining how something simple like progressbar works
[09:08:55] <ajpiano> even though it's nifty
[09:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/widget/default.html
[09:08:57] <rworth> progressbar doesn't have enough
[09:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> it's true, my widget factory article builds a progressbar, it doesn't cover everything
[09:09:59] <ajpiano> the colorize demo doesn't like, create any proxy elems or anything
[09:10:12] <ajpiano> i'll write my SJ article on whatever widget factory demo we end up settling on though
[09:10:25] <rworth> cool
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> proxy elements? like generating elements and doing something with them?
[09:11:18] <ajpiano> yep
[09:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> we could have an extension that generates a smaller box in the corner of the main box and colors it with the inverse color or something like that
[09:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> or we could just add a button to change the color
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> instead of clicking on the whole element to change the color
[09:12:51] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:12:53] <ajpiano> that would be ideal
[09:13:07] <ajpiano> cause that is like, an integral part of what you do with widgets, is add more elements and connect em
[09:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: menu?
[09:14:48] <rworth> jzaefferer couldn't make it
[09:14:55] <rworth> we want to do a call Mon
[09:15:00] <rworth> like we did for selectmenu
[09:15:08] <rworth> discuss some open issues on menu and menubar
[09:15:18] <rworth> kborchers can you make 1pm Eastern next Mon?
[09:15:34] <rworth> also, anyone else interested in coming?
[09:16:04] <kborchers> I will try. At my full-time job then but will see if I can get some time away.
[09:16:15] <ajpiano> i could listen in, might be swamped in client land
[09:16:40] <rworth> kborchers what timezone are you in again?
[09:16:48] <kborchers> CST
[09:16:58] <rworth> at least it's lunchtime then
[09:17:11] <kborchers> Exactly, going to try to make that work
[09:17:18] <rworth> great, scheduled then
[09:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> so we had the selectmenu planning meeting
[09:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> made some good progress going through the open issues and the current API
[09:19:44] <scott_gonzalez> we won't be starting from any of the existing branches though
[09:19:53] <ajpiano> are there any repercussions that relate to menu from selectmenu that might be worth discussing?
[09:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> we'll use the existing implementations as references, like we did for autocomplete
[09:19:58] <ajpiano> in the menu meeting?
[09:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we know of any yet
[09:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'd still like menu to be able to work against arbitrary markup though
[09:21:14] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: can you make the menu mtg?
[09:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm out W-F next week
[09:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> but I can make the Monday meeting
[09:22:27] <felixnagel> hey there, jörn chatted with me earlier and asked if I could join. Sadly I had no time to check your wiki changes for selectmenu
[09:22:54] <rworth> I'm out T-F next week
[09:23:20] <rworth> I think Jörn is also out part of next week
[09:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> sounds like next week will be very productive :-P
[09:25:05] <rworth> Monday will :)
[09:25:21] * rworth posted meeting to menu wiki page
[09:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> Chris Bannon reviewed tooltip
[09:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> he left his comments on the wiki
[09:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> we'll review them this week
[09:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> nothing on spinner yet
[09:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> nothing on bugs
[09:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> last week, adoven_ and gnarf reviewed pull requests with me for a few hours
[09:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> we're down to 25 pull requests
[09:28:23] <rworth> yay
[09:28:31] <ajpiano> nice work gentlemans
[09:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> I also sent over a list of CSS pull requests to FG, Maggie is reviewing them
[09:29:01] <rworth> going to set a regular weekly time for that?
[09:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> not sure, we can schedule another meeting this week and see what's left over after that
[09:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> does the same time work?
[09:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> tomorrow at 1:00p ET
[09:30:46] <adoven_> yeah
[09:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> anyone else?
[09:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok, well, adoven_ and I will be reviewing them tomorrow if anyone wants to join us
[09:33:22] <ajpiano> i might be able to hop in - i have a 1pm call every day right now but that project is ending next week (i hope)
[09:34:27] <scott_gonzalez> ARIA hackathon
[09:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> Mozilla is working on sending the $4k
[09:34:37] <scott_gonzalez> nobody else has gotten back to us
[09:35:15] <scott_gonzalez> we'll get Hans Hillen to join us with the Mozilla sponsorship
[09:35:57] <scott_gonzalez> 1.6.1 support is turning out to be a pain with the .prop() change
[09:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> I've created a branch for the update: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/core-1.6.1
[09:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> we're running into problems with boolean ARIA attributes
[09:36:36] <ajpiano> hum
[09:36:43] <ajpiano> you should talk to timmy/dave about how to approach it perhaps
[09:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, was planning on talking to timmy about it
[09:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> tests are passing in Chrome, but some fail in IE 6
[09:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> haven't gotten to any other browsers yet
[09:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> since we ran into problems, we're going to push 1.8.14 now without 1.6.x support
[09:38:45] <scott_gonzalez> we can push 1.8.15 as soon as we solve the problems
[09:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'd also like to have a meeting to discuss how to test animations
[09:39:51] <ajpiano> what's pending for 1.8.14
[09:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> nothing, just have to do the whole release process
[09:40:23] <ajpiano> no but like, why do it without 1.6.1 support?
[09:40:29] <adoven_> scott_gonzalez: i'd like to be included on the test animations meeting
[09:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> because it's been a month and we have 25 tickets
[09:40:55] <ajpiano> ok, sounds good to me
[09:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> and because not releasing 1.8.14 doesn't help anyone :-P
[09:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok, the rest is API related
[09:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> first is accordion: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/287
[09:42:16] <scott_gonzalez> the question is what happen when you activate a panel during the animation from another panel being activated?
[09:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> so let's say you have a really slow animation, say 5 seconds
[09:42:37] <scott_gonzalez> and you click on header 2
[09:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> while panel 2 is opening, you click on header 3
[09:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> and then you click on header 4
[09:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> both of those clicks are during the animation for panel 2
[09:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> we need to figure out the timing of events (beforeActivate and activate)
[09:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> and when we update the active option
[09:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> and whether we show all of the animations
[09:44:38] <ajpiano> it would seem to me that we should debounce activations, so at least you can't get the situation of hitting 3 AND 4
[09:44:42] <ajpiano> while 2 is animating
[09:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> oh right, this might just be for programmatic activations, not user activations
[09:45:34] <ajpiano> and then once we know they intend to activate, stop the other animation and reverse it
[09:45:44] <ajpiano> hum
[09:46:29] <ajpiano> well the latter would still apply, i tend to think we should just stop the existing animation dead in its tracks and close the pane while opening the intended one
[09:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> we don't have a way to do that though
[09:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was a proposed feature for core animations
[09:47:22] <ajpiano> yeah, it's kinda solved in core now
[09:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> but there's no way to stop an animation in the middle and then start a new animation as if you were in the same spot
[09:47:34] <ajpiano> there is in git
[09:47:42] <ajpiano> for core
[09:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[09:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> so it'll be in 1.6.2?
[09:47:50] <ajpiano> yeah, it's awesome
[09:47:56] <ajpiano> no, it's a 1.7 feature :/
[09:48:05] <ajpiano> let me get the ticket
[09:48:28] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8685
[09:48:39] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/gqZL5/17/
[09:49:12] <adoven_> wow, that is cool
[09:49:29] <ajpiano> yeah, thank ryan florence
[09:49:38] <rworth> totally
[09:50:38] <ajpiano> not sure if it's something we can steal for ui without stealing all of .animate
[09:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so let's look into using that in accordion
[09:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> even if we can't, it'd be good to know if we can use it when 1.7 lands
[09:50:59] <ajpiano> yeah, we could make it a 1.9 change potentially
[09:51:04] <ajpiano> yeah.
[09:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> any idea if it's able to work with different animations?
[09:51:55] <scott_gonzalez> well, different easinings
[09:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling it won't work
[09:52:46] <ajpiano> not sure
[09:53:00] <ajpiano> theoretically more work could be done to improve it before 1.7
[09:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> next up is datepicker
[09:53:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7079
[09:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> is it valid to use datepicker with a date format that doesn't include the day?
[09:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so
[09:54:33] <ajpiano> it isn't necessarily not
[09:54:33] <ajpiano> :/
[09:55:19] <rworth> html5 adds type="date" type="month" type="week" type="time" type="datetime" type="datetime-local"
[09:56:26] <ajpiano> i don't think it's that irrational for people to want people to use datepicker just to present a calendar for people to pick a month from, and then ignore the date
[09:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> the UI doesn't even make sense though
[09:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> to click on a specific day in order to select a month
[09:56:38] <ajpiano> sure, they have to click a date, but ... yeah.
[09:56:39] <rworth> Opera supports all of them, and with type="month" it looks like a normal datepicker, regardless of which day in the month you select, it selects that month
[09:56:48] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:57:12] <rworth> same thing with week
[09:57:16] <adoven_> then the question becomes, do you show a "day" selected
[09:57:30] <adoven_> how do i know that i have a month selected
[09:57:31] <rworth> ugly as heck, but I don't think Opera has it wrong with the UI (though I could imagine other UIs as well)
[09:57:36] <rworth> but they'd still be datepickers
[09:58:17] <rworth> adoven_: do you mean if you open it back up and go to a different month but have not yet clicked on a date in that month?
[09:58:23] * rworth gives 2min warning
[09:58:44] * rworth reminds there is a meeting after this one
[09:59:02] <adoven_> yeah, so i choose go in and click march 15th and then go to something else and click back to bring the datepicker up, what does it show
[09:59:16] <rworth> http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html#type-date
[09:59:32] <ajpiano> we should be storing a full date internally and only writing the value out to the field formatted
[10:00:23] <rworth> adoven_: may be better to try it in Opera as it's hard to get a feel for the hover in the screenshot, but the whole month hover highlights when you are over it
[10:00:39] <adoven_> yeah, that makes sense
[10:00:40] <rworth> does not highlight any particalar day as you're not selecting a day, same with week
[10:01:03] <rworth> ok, time's up. Time for UI Grid meeting to start
[10:01:06] <rworth> thanks everyone
[10:02:47] <borismoore> Brad and I are just finishing a meeting. Be with you soon.
[10:03:07] <rworth> ok
[10:05:03] <rworth> ready to start?
[10:07:04] <brado23> I'm ready.  Boris is 1 minute away here.  We were at the same mtg beforehand.
[10:07:38] <rworth> we'll start when he get's here. Anyone else on?
[10:08:10] <brado23> quiet today
[10:08:15] <rworth> indeed
[10:08:35] <JohnBrinkman> I'm here.  But don't expect to have anything to say...
[10:08:40] <vicMitnick> I'm here, though don't have anything to say :)
[10:08:47] <rworth> np
[10:09:10] <rworth> JohnBrinkman: have you gotten an email from Bradley?
[10:09:29] <JohnBrinkman> not yet
[10:09:44] <brado23> On the "editing events" wiki page, I'd promised to present an editing API...
[10:09:46] <borismoore> I'm back
[10:09:50] <rworth> I will bump him, he may have been out of town
[10:09:56] <JohnBrinkman> good
[10:10:00] <rworth> ok, let's begin then
[10:10:09] <rworth> jzaefferer can't make it today
[10:10:27] <rworth> but he and I met to look at the plan for Stage 3, set a target completion date of Aug 31
[10:10:37] <rworth> we're about 100hrs in to 400hrs estimate
[10:10:50] <rworth> still quite a bit to do, this is the largest of all the stages
[10:11:01] <rworth> next is Editing
[10:11:18] <brado23> Here is a demo I put together http://brado23.github.com/jquery-ui/grid-spf/observable/observable.html
[10:11:19] <rworth> everyone on the agenda?
[10:11:25] <brado23> Oh sorry
[10:11:30] <borismoore> yup
[10:12:01] <rworth> brado23: you're fine, I think that's related?
[10:12:50] <brado23> Yes, so what I have thusfar is the demo at the link.  I'll follow up with some wiki content to frame things...
[10:12:51] <rworth> or is that row 101 ?
[10:12:56] <rworth> ok
[10:13:13] <rworth> I know jzaefferer has done some work as well, you guys are communicating
[10:13:26] <rworth> any general update, or we'll wait to see it come out on the wiki?
[10:13:34] <brado23> Yes, that's right.  I hope to connect with him wrt this demo.
[10:13:38] <rworth> great
[10:13:42] <rworth> Globalization
[10:13:50] <brado23> Yes, of interest today is the jquery.observable.js file in the demo.
[10:14:12] <rworth> I started taking this over in the last week, in earnest
[10:14:13] <brado23> It has a really simple API to (1) mutate data then (2) issue events.
[10:14:25] <rworth> sorry, moved on too quickly
[10:14:39] <brado23> one more thing then...
[10:15:27] <brado23> In jquery.observable.js, I'll refer folks to setField, which accepts a .serializeArray()'d form...in the space of the "I want to commit a form" scenario re: events.
[10:16:05] <brado23> I'll summarize this in wiki content and follow-up with jzaafferer and others who are interested.
[10:16:47] <rworth> thanks
[10:17:10] <rworth> on globalization, as shown on the wiki page we're going to make it even more independent of jQuery
[10:17:13] <rworth> it won't be a jQuery plugin
[10:17:22] <rworth> it will be a JavaScript library called globalize.js
[10:18:02] <rworth> Hope to have that migration wrapped up this week, and that should put us into a good position to accept contribution on that lib, as well as get other (non-jQuery people/projects) using it
[10:18:10] <rworth> the API may change a bit
[10:18:28] <rworth> and there won't be a jQuery plugin that wraps it, just some proxied methods in jQuery UI core
[10:18:47] <rworth> but those can come later, or for purposes of grid we might have a shim plugin, but nothing we'll release and support
[10:18:51] <rworth> any questions?
[10:18:56] <borismoore> Is there a lot of redundant/proxied code?
[10:19:16] <rworth> that will go in jQuery UI core?
[10:19:33] <rworth> there will be default implementations that will do next to nothing
[10:19:46] <borismoore> Helpers like each...?
[10:19:54] <rworth> so that plugin/widget authors can use the API like $.parseInt and $.parseFloat
[10:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> things like $.parseInt = Globalize.parseInt || parseInt;
[10:20:06] <rworth> while not having to rely on a global called globalize
[10:20:08] <rworth> exactly
[10:20:58] <borismoore> Do you need a global called $? (not jQuery)
[10:21:06] <rworth> and then if a consumer of said plugin wants to globalize it they include Globalize and any cultures they want
[10:21:24] <rworth> globalize.js will introduce a global called 'Globalize'
[10:21:40] <rworth> jQuery UI core will not suggest people use it but instead a similar API on $.
[10:21:58] <rworth> which will then use Globalize if present, otherwise reasonable fallbacks
[10:22:10] <rworth> like natives
[10:22:32] <rworth> ok, not update on Selecting this week, I should have one next week
[10:22:53] <rworth> borismoore: can you look at the question on the agenda, B102 ?
[10:23:08] <rworth> is this a review you wanted to do, you wanted done? Was it?
[10:23:24] <rworth> and what's the next step here? Is it related to the Editing topic above?
[10:23:27] <borismoore> Let me give status on template rendering first. That was my primary task for this last week
[10:23:41] <borismoore> I have done a lot of work on template rendering implementations - delta between JsRender, jQuery tmpl, strappend (Mike Samuel's implementation).
[10:23:53] <borismoore> I have a repo here https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl-render-proposal forked and iterated from Mike's work
[10:24:03] <borismoore> I'll be putting conclusions, links and analysis on the wiki over the next couple of days
[10:24:13] <rworth> sorry, I mean to have that in there first
[10:24:27] <borismoore> Sure
[10:24:37] <borismoore> Then I'll be moving to the Data Source review and the Pager work.
[10:25:09] <borismoore> which was my main task, in principle, for this coming week
[10:25:28] <borismoore> I will also look at the relationship with editing, I hope/expect
[10:25:42] <borismoore> and collaborate with Brad and Joern as app.
[10:25:52] <borismoore> appropriate
[10:26:22] <rworth> great, thanks
[10:26:37] <borismoore> That's it
[10:26:41] <borismoore> for now from me
[10:26:43] <rworth> Ok, there are still a number of open TODOS listed, if someone needs a task
[10:27:09] <rworth> also, thre are some new components on Custom Inputs page to be designed and built
[10:27:32] <rworth> another open task (on the agenda after TODOs) is fix the preloader
[10:27:56] <rworth> there's a note about Stage 5, we'll scope it out after Stage 3
[10:28:11] <rworth> the rest of the items are just things we don't want to drop
[10:28:14] <rworth> any other updates?
[10:29:11] <borismoore> not from me
[10:29:26] <brado23> that's all from me
[10:29:32] <rworth> ok, thanks everyone. See you in #jqueryui-dev and next week
[10:29:39] <rworth> and of course on the wiki :)
