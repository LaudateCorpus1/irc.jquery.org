[09:10:39] <jzaefferer> also, hello arschmitz, good to have you back!
[09:10:55] <jzaefferer> Scott started (another?) review of button
[09:11:06] <jzaefferer> I don't know how far along that is
[09:11:13] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thanks it was a bit sketchy for a bit lol
[09:11:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: im not sure i saw emails but have not had a chance to look
[09:11:39] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:11:45] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: when can you finish the jscs PR?
[09:11:58] <arschmitz> remind me what it still needs?
[09:12:08] <arschmitz> is it just the one config change
[09:12:23] <arschmitz> i mostly didnt have wifi while gone so im catching u[
[09:12:25] <arschmitz> up
[09:12:32] <jzaefferer> config change and maybe some rebasing?
[09:12:44] <arschmitz> ok ill do it today / tonight
[09:12:44] <jzaefferer> there's at least one commit that said "squash" or something
[09:13:06] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:13:12] <jzaefferer> fnagel: any news on datepicker?
[09:13:44] <fnagel> Waiting for Scotts review
[09:13:57] <fnagel> Or more review in general
[09:14:22] <jzaefferer> How's "work on broken focus handling" going?
[09:14:25] <jzaefferer> Is that blocked?
[09:14:41] <jzaefferer> I can look into reviewing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1590
[09:14:44] <fnagel> Blocked, I want the PR merged first because GREEN TESTS :-D
[09:14:48] <jzaefferer> right
[09:14:58] <fnagel> Thanks!
[09:15:19] <jzaefferer> Will do that tomorrow
[09:15:27] <jzaefferer> How about "Schedule a meeting to discuss cldr"
[09:15:36] <jzaefferer> I guess that hasn't happened so far?
[09:15:49] <fnagel> No, I'm not sure who should be on board.
[09:16:05] <fnagel> And assumed Scott will do this :-/
[09:16:33] <jzaefferer> Well, he hasn't, so could you organize that?
[09:16:39] <jzaefferer> Invite Scott, Alex, me and of course Rafael
[09:16:49] <fnagel> Sure!
[09:16:54] <jzaefferer> And whoever else I'm forgetting or I'm not aware of
[09:17:12] <fnagel> What's the best channel for sending invitations?
[09:17:26] <fnagel> I *think* that should be everyone
[09:17:50] <jzaefferer> jquery-devs-team would cast a wider net
[09:18:14] <jzaefferer> otherwise custom email list, maybe with doodle
[09:18:24] <fnagel> Is that a IRC channel?
[09:18:30] <fnagel> Mail and doodle sounds good to me
[09:18:35] <jzaefferer> http://doodle.com/
[09:18:46] <jzaefferer> oh, sorry, jquery-devs-team@googlegroups.com
[09:19:01] <jzaefferer> you should be on that
[09:19:23] <fnagel> I guess so, wasn't aware of the exact address
[09:19:29] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:19:56] <jzaefferer> When you invite people, can you provide a summary or event agenda? I'm not up-to-date of what needs to be discussed there
[09:20:16] <fnagel> I will summarize what's in the wiki
[09:20:32] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:21:00] <jzaefferer> I hope we can finish 1.12 sooooon, to shift focus to datepicker and pointer events...
[09:21:52] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: have you heard anything about npm/CJS?
[09:22:23] <arschmitz> npm cjs??
[09:22:38] <jzaefferer> npm/CJS

[09:22:42] <jzaefferer> 	Scott asked Juho to provide feedback
[09:22:44] <jzaefferer> (from the agenda)

[09:23:27] <jzaefferer> okay, will have to wait for Scott

[10:04:25] <arthurvr> Hey

[10:04:33] <AurelioDeRosa> Hello!
[10:04:36] <agcolom> sorry only just got back
[10:05:36] <arthurvr> Anyone else around? kswedberg, arschmitz?
[10:05:47] <kswedberg> hey!
[10:05:50] <arschmitz> kinda here in another meeting
[10:06:22] <agcolom> cool!
[10:06:23] <arthurvr> hey-hey
[10:06:30] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit
[10:08:06] <agcolom> ok, so I just have one question for arschmitz: should we update the mobile api docs to 1.11.1 or stay as we are? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/358#issuecomment-138403732
[10:08:15] <arschmitz> 1.11.1
[10:08:28] <agcolom> cool, thanks
[10:08:29] <arschmitz> sorry iv been out of the country
[10:08:40] <agcolom> sure, no problem
[10:08:44] <arschmitz> and had crazyness happen there being left with no hotel
[10:08:57] <agcolom> oh dear! doesn't sound like fun!
[10:09:06] <arschmitz> no bad conference organizer
[10:09:22] <agcolom> I have one more question
[10:09:36] <AurelioDeRosa> I'm sorry to hear that.
[10:10:05] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/383
[10:10:12] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[10:10:38] <agcolom> and then I'm done ;-) I can do the updates tomorrow
[10:11:06] <arschmitz> just a sec checking
[10:11:22] <arschmitz> countTheme null
[10:11:31] <arschmitz> dividertheme null
[10:12:00] <arschmitz> splitTheme also null
[10:12:19] <arschmitz> countTheme is also deprecated in 1.4
[10:12:23] <agcolom> cool. And inherited from parent ok to add to all 3?
[10:12:57] <arschmitz> yess
[10:13:09] <agcolom> brilliant! Thank you!
[10:13:18] <agcolom> Other things on the agenda...
[10:13:48] <agcolom> New grunt-jquery-content feature allows to setup redirects in the repo (redirects.json)
[10:13:48] <agcolom> Arthur working on moving all redirects from the infrastructure repo to the repos
[10:13:48] <agcolom> Example: https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/108
[10:13:49] <agcolom> Should be finished soon as there are only a few sites to go
[10:14:06] <agcolom> arthurvr: would you like to say a few words?
[10:14:28] <arthurvr> sure, just wanted you all to be aware of this. We can now setup site redirects using a file in the repo
[10:14:42] <arthurvr> which means we don’t need to ask infra people every time we delete or move around pages
[10:14:47] <arthurvr> :)
[10:14:52] <agcolom> sounds great!
[10:14:55] <agcolom> Thank
[10:14:57] <agcolom> s
[10:15:09] <arthurvr> Just some existing ones in the infra repo that need to be moved to the site repos
[10:15:28] <AurelioDeRosa> that's awesome. Good work!
[10:15:46] <arthurvr> Just gotta do these and I’m done. https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/fc4b4902f057899726f77a9a25474d967e3f8b42/modules/jquery/manifests/wp/jquery.pp
[10:15:56] <arthurvr> And then delete them all from the infra repo.
[10:16:02] <agcolom> cool!
[10:16:14] <agcolom> next item...
[10:16:21] <agcolom> Status on the http -> https redirects?
[10:16:35] <arthurvr> few weeks ago we discussed this
[10:16:47] <arthurvr> but I don’t think anything changed
[10:17:34] <arthurvr> June 17 it was
[10:17:48] <kswedberg> I think it's up to infra to implement it. Makes sense to me to just have https by default and have http redirect to https
[10:18:02] <arthurvr> Yes, but I do believe we’ll need to do some testing first.
[10:18:21] <arthurvr> I saw various issues with the sites on https pop up
[10:18:40] <kswedberg> interesting. what kind of issues?
[10:18:46] <arthurvr> one minute
[10:19:52] <arthurvr> generally just mixed content issues (on demos for example)
[10:20:33] <kswedberg> ah, right. that makes sense. yeah, we'll have to hunt down references to http:
[10:20:41] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/118 for example
[10:21:03] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/14
[10:22:49] <agcolom> ok, so we agree that we need to replace refs to http to https?
[10:23:11] <arthurvr> Yeah, I’ll see if I can hunt down most of them.
[10:23:21] * arthurvr adds to todo list
[10:23:24] <arthurvr> should be easy enough
[10:23:40] <agcolom> brilliant! Thank you so much arthurvr!
[10:24:29] <kswedberg> yeah, thx, arthurvr !
[10:24:35] <arthurvr> o/
[10:24:56] <agcolom> ok, excellent.
[10:25:04] <agcolom> Globalizejs docs: a new contributor has offered to help :-)
[10:25:04] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.globalizejs.com/pull/2
[10:25:07] <agcolom> next point:
[10:25:14] <arthurvr> Good to see that people are willing to help out
[10:25:25] <agcolom> sorry (issues when pasting multiple lines ;-) )
[10:25:37] <agcolom> yes, thats really encouraging
[10:26:20] <kswedberg> yeah, rafael is awesome about reaching out for help, too. I really appreciate that.
[10:26:31] <agcolom> absolutely!
[10:26:32] <arthurvr> Yeah, really cool :+1:
[10:26:57] <agcolom> I noticed this person was based in Brazil as well :-)
[10:27:17] <arthurvr> wow, awesome!
[10:28:12] <agcolom> Other than that, we have the dev summit in NYC in oct, and I'm hoping that this will also help get more contributors to our various content repos
[10:28:31] <AurelioDeRosa> I hope so as well. It'd be nice to have more help.
[10:28:47] <arthurvr> yeah
[10:28:55] <kswedberg> I'm so bummed I can't make it. :(
[10:29:00] <arthurvr> Sadly I won’t be there too
[10:29:16] <agcolom> I know, noone from content except me can make it :-(
[10:29:35] <arthurvr> ha
[10:29:38] <AurelioDeRosa> That's a shame. I didn't realize that :S
[10:29:55] <agcolom> And AurelioDeRosa and I will try to meet soon ;-)
[10:30:00] <arthurvr> :(
[10:30:02] <agcolom> (we're both in London!)
[10:30:12] <arthurvr> Oh, right, cool
[10:30:53] <AurelioDeRosa> Anne, are you attending The lead developer conference of State of the browser by any chance?
[10:31:03] <agcolom> nope :-(
[10:31:08] <agcolom> when is that?
[10:31:34] <AurelioDeRosa> The lead developer is Friday, while State of the browser happens Saturday
[10:31:57] <agcolom> no, sorry :(
[10:32:10] <AurelioDeRosa> no worrie
[10:32:13] <AurelioDeRosa> *worries
[10:32:18] <agcolom> saturday is tricky for me with kids
[10:32:33] <agcolom> ok, so I guess we're done for the meeting?
[10:33:21] <agcolom> does anyone have anything to add/discuss?
[10:33:25] <arthurvr> Not me at least
[10:33:53] <agcolom> ok, I'll upload the minutes tomorrow....
[10:33:55] <AurelioDeRosa> Just a quick note.
[10:34:00] <agcolom> sure
[10:34:23] <AurelioDeRosa> For the next meeting my goal is to take care of the mobile website, so I'll address the issue (and hopefully more) that you (Anne) opened
[10:34:56] <agcolom> oh yes, excellent! Thank you!
[10:35:09] <agcolom> That would be absolutely awesome!
[10:35:53] <agcolom> Ok then, thanks everyone! Speak soon!
[10:35:56] <arthurvr> By the way, I’ve been away for very long, but AurelioDeRosa are you setup on ZNC now?
[10:36:21] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes. Since 3-4 weeks ago.
[10:36:42] <arthurvr> Alright, cool, was on vacation back then :)
[10:36:46] <arthurvr> thx :)
[10:36:58] <AurelioDeRosa> I think there has been an issue today though as my "ghost" wasn't connected.
[10:37:09] <AurelioDeRosa> Anyway, I'll try to sort it out after the meeting.
[10:37:27] <arthurvr> Maybe someone in #jquery-infrastructure can help :)
[10:37:50] <arthurvr> So that’s it for today I guess
[10:38:24] <agcolom> ok, thank you all,
[10:38:31] <kswedberg> thanks. :)
[10:38:37] <arthurvr> bye everybody
[10:38:40] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes. Thank you everyone. See you soon!
