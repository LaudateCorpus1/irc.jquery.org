[09:00:43] <jzaefferer> jQuery UI Meeting time! Ping agcolom arschmitz fnagel gnarf kborchers mikesherov petersendidit rxaviers scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll - agenda is here: http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda3
[09:00:57] <mikesherov> hi!
[09:00:59] <fnagel> hi!
[09:01:06] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:07] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:01:12] <kborchers> i imagine scott_gonzalez won't be here
[09:01:22] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:02:02] <jzaefferer> not really in order, but since he's here: mikesherov, got anything on the effects rewrite? An estimate when you can get started on that again?
[09:02:18] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:25] <mikesherov> so, when we left off, I had asked for a review, despite the failing tests
[09:02:38] <jzaefferer> I suppose that never happened
[09:02:53] <mikesherov> correct
[09:03:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez got swamped with plugins / mobile merge / etc.
[09:03:08] <jzaefferer> I'm afraid to go in there alone, but I can probably team up with Scott when he's back
[09:03:12] <mikesherov> I didn't push because I got kids
[09:03:35] <tj_vantoll> here now
[09:03:40] <jzaefferer> maybe gnarf could take a look? He's way more familiar than me
[09:04:19] <jzaefferer> We'll get there
[09:04:32] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: The AMD stuff is also blocked by Scott's work on removing globals?
[09:04:38] <mikesherov> there are two things pending really: 1. failing tests (which I think are faulty tests), 2. one of the effects actually needs to modify layout, so that one should use placeholder, but the placeholder should shrink accordingly
[09:04:47] <mikesherov> so that's my update on that
[09:04:50] <rxaviers> yeap, correct
[09:05:33] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: so that's something you could work on, even without the review?
[09:06:09] <mikesherov> right, I will if that's cool, but I wanted some feedback before I plunked down the potential final pull.
[09:06:31] <mikesherov> I can start that up again in earnest Nov. 4th (I start a new job where I get 20% time)
[09:06:33] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay. I don't know how far Scott go on that. Maybe I can finish that part
[09:06:39] <mikesherov> I might get to it before then
[09:07:01] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: I think its better to continue - can't be THAT wrong :-)
[09:07:19] <mikesherov> haha, hopefully
[09:07:35] <jzaefferer> but then I'm not familiar with the code at all; ask Scott to review if you think that's better
[09:07:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: did you make progress on tracking down what caused DB to fail?
[09:08:13] <jzaefferer> kborchers: do you have something to report from the a11y summit?
[09:08:17] <rxaviers> yeap, there was a bug in the cache code
[09:08:24] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: did you get started on the button rewrite?
[09:08:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i have not made any progress sense last meeting because i was at summit most of the time
[09:08:57] <rxaviers> is it ok if we all reply in parallel? rsrs
[09:09:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: worth a try :-)
[09:09:18] <rxaviers> :)
[09:09:32] <kborchers> jzaefferer: it went well … i need to track down the code people wrote but there were some interesting approaches to fixing a11y of tooltips with ajax loaded content and contextual help for all widgets in general that we should review and see if we can implement
[09:09:35] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: ah, okay. Then I've got the same question for you as for kborchers
[09:09:57] <arschmitz> yeah same thing kborchers just said basicly
[09:10:18] <kborchers> none of the code was "merge ready" but it could be good inspiration
[09:10:23] <arschmitz> dont really need to track down code for the contextual help but something to discuss i think
[09:10:25] <jzaefferer> kborchers: sounds good. I'm happy to review and test tooltip updates
[09:10:31] <kborchers> or we could contact those folks and ask for PRs
[09:10:42] <arschmitz> tooltip would like to track down their code for sure though
[09:10:44] <jzaefferer> What's contextual help?
[09:10:45] <rxaviers> We had two issues recently in DB, (a) the service getting down/unresponsive, therefore bad gateway; and (b) bad themeroller url.
[09:11:19] <rxaviers> The (a) issue seems to have been caused by the cache bug. Because, we no one complained anymore after I fixed it.
[09:11:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: basicly provide usage instructions that dont have a strict definition already to how to use them
[09:11:28] <kborchers> jzaefferer: basically when a widget or a focusable element inside a widget gains focus, help on how to use it is read by screen readers and/or presented on screen
[09:12:45] <rxaviers> The (b) issue was caused by client-side bugs, which I also fixed (code has been fixed, so no more bad urls are created; code has been fixed to workaround existing bad urls out there). After that, no more complains neither
[09:13:08] <kborchers> contextual help definitely needed more work but was an interesting idea
[09:13:12] <jzaefferer> kborchers: Okay. Can you take care of that? Get people to send PRs or get the underlying idea in a form where it can be reviewed.
[09:13:20] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yep
[09:13:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: sounds good, thanks
[09:13:41] <rxaviers> :)
[09:13:45] <arschmitz> kborchers: want to collaborate on a google doc or something for that?
[09:13:56] <kborchers> no way!
[09:13:58] <kborchers> sure :P
[09:14:04] <arschmitz> lol
[09:14:24] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: could you help me with the unit test here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1108
[09:14:24] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #1108 by jzaefferer (4h 19m ago): Dialog: Restore focus to the previously focused element when window regains focus
[09:14:35] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: there is one button related thing that did not come up last week that i think is worth noting / discussion
[09:15:11] <jzaefferer> fnagel: any news on selectmenu? any blockers?
[09:15:14] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: what's that?
[09:15:33] <arschmitz> using the approach outlined last week we would be dropping support for icons on ie7
[09:15:48] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: I'll think through that, but off the top of my head I have no idea.
[09:16:16] <fnagel> jzaefferer: No, nothing so far. Waiting for feedback on several changes (width options) and kborchers pending fix
[09:16:23] <arschmitz> due to lack of support for :before and :after pseudo elements
[09:17:09] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: the gdoc has "Can we use ::before/::after for icons and ignore IE7?", I guess we never answered that? When it comes to supported browsers, I prefer to let Scott answer. He certainly has stronger opinions there than me
[09:17:13] <kborchers> fnagel: oh right … can you ping me on the PR on your repo as a reminder to implement that in the ui repo so you can pull it in?
[09:17:22] <fnagel> sure
[09:17:25] <kborchers> thanks
[09:17:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yes its in the doc it just did not come up in meeting
[09:17:55] <arschmitz> scott was fine with it i just figured others should get a chance to weigh in
[09:18:10] <jzaefferer> if Scott is fine with it, then I'm as well
[09:18:34] <fnagel> kborchers: done!
[09:18:51] <fnagel> Would be nice if somebody could check the new selectenu width options and provide some feedback
[09:19:18] <arschmitz> fnagel: ill look at it some since i was one of the people complaining it was needed :)
[09:19:33] <tj_vantoll> fnagel: I'll look as well.
[09:19:38] <jzaefferer> fnagel: can you update the wiki page, to include the width option?
[09:19:39] <fnagel> arschmitz: hehe, thanks
[09:19:48] <jzaefferer> also sounds like you've got reviewers
[09:20:36] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I've included it in the notes now, about not supporting IE7 for button icons
[09:20:47] <fnagel> jzaefferer: I would like to wait for some feedback first as I've implemented these options without a specification
[09:21:24] <fnagel> Just wanted to have something to test when disussing the width issue next time
[09:21:25] <jzaefferer> sure. If its implemented, you might as well specifiy it; if it gets kicked out, remove it from the spec. But if they know what to look for, its fine
[09:22:15] <jzaefferer> On Ticket triage: We're doing okay on tickets: 0 pending, just +1 on total. But five more open PRs, but suck at dealing with those.
[09:23:06] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll mikesherov: Could you share the burden of doing CLA and other basic checks on new PRs? We shouldn't keep people waiting on rather trivial issues...
[09:23:38] <jzaefferer> Check for: CLA signature; ticket; unit tests. Maybe more?
[09:24:21] <mikesherov> travis
[09:24:25] <mikesherov> make travis do it
[09:24:41] <mikesherov> I could definitely do this
[09:24:45] <mikesherov> and I will
[09:24:53] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: do you have some boilerplate?
[09:24:57] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: well, Scott has been working on automating the CLA check, but as with many things Scott works on, its not done yet
[09:25:01] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I made a pass through the pull requests a month or so ago and cleaned up some. Most of the requests we're either waiting on people and should just close OR we have to either accept/reject it.
[09:25:16] <tj_vantoll> I don't have a boilerplate.
[09:25:22] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: we should do a PR bash
[09:25:22] <jzaefferer> We can close "pending" PRs after two (or four) weeks?
[09:25:32] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: consider it done
[09:25:37] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov: Yeah we should.
[09:26:00] <jzaefferer> there was discussion about a bot that comments with a task list
[09:26:06] <jzaefferer> I think Angular uses that
[09:26:08] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: right
[09:26:12] <jzaefferer> I can't remember where or who discussed that
[09:26:22] <mikesherov> I discussed back in the mergeatron days
[09:26:27] <jzaefferer> I'll ask on the dev leads team
[09:26:29] <mikesherov> also, travis should handle this
[09:26:31] <tj_vantoll> - CLA
[09:26:31] <tj_vantoll> - Test
[09:26:31] <tj_vantoll> - Coding Standards
[09:26:31] <tj_vantoll> - Commit Message Standards
[09:26:49] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: lets draft some boilerplate and add it to the contribute siute
[09:26:52] <mikesherov> site*
[09:27:00] <mikesherov> then we can use that when this gets automated eventually
[09:27:11] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: how about this order? CLA signature; ticket; unit tests, coding standards, commit message standards.
[09:27:30] <jzaefferer> coding and commit message standards should come last; those should never prevent a merge and can be manually fixed
[09:27:36] <tj_vantoll> Makes sense to me.
[09:27:48] <tj_vantoll> It would give us a good baseline to close after 2 − 4 weeks as well.
[09:28:12] <jzaefferer> contribute site and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?
[09:29:21] <mikesherov> so we should rewrite contributing.md
[09:29:24] <mikesherov> it's the wrong focus
[09:29:36] <mikesherov> it currently talks about how to get involved
[09:29:50] <mikesherov> it should just be the preflight checklist before you hit submit
[09:30:07] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: okay, I'm good with that. Its currently way too long to actually be read
[09:30:22] <rxaviers> agree with mike
[09:30:22] <mikesherov> ok, I'll submit a patch that we can bikeshed
[09:30:31] <jzaefferer> cool, thanks
[09:30:55] <tj_vantoll> Ok, once we have those guidelines we should schedule a call and make a pass through the pull request queue with everyone interested.
[09:31:47] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: that works, though I'm more interested in keeping up with new PRs. Stale ones will not get that much staler ;)
[09:32:12] <tj_vantoll> Agreed. That's why I said we should get new guidelines in place first :P
[09:32:17] <jzaefferer> yep
[09:32:38] <jzaefferer> btw. I've tested jscs. Doesn't cover everything, but should already be a big help for coding standard checks
[09:32:51] <tj_vantoll> cool
[09:33:00] <jzaefferer> I'll have a PR or two for that later, one to fix issues it found, one to add it to grunt
[09:33:01] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: mikesherov: im happy to help with prs also would be good to share standards / boilerplate with mobile for this
[09:33:11] <arschmitz> and i cleaned up all mobile prs a month or so ago
[09:33:20] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: cool
[09:33:23] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: agenda from last week had this: "Add learn article about direct invocation vs. jQuery method invocation" - did you work on that? Is it done? Or still open?
[09:33:31] <mikesherov> arschmitz: yeah, I cleaned up UI PRs about a year ago
[09:33:36] <mikesherov> time to clean them up again, LOL
[09:33:58] <arschmitz> yeah on mobile been trying to keep them under 5 lol
[09:34:06] <arschmitz> reviewing everything once a week
[09:34:18] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: Not live yet but done.
[09:34:36] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez was going to tag it then he went to Russia.
[09:34:40] <tj_vantoll> But the work is done.
[09:34:57] <tj_vantoll> Which finishes my docs updates.
[09:35:33] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: I can tag stuff. Or give you access to tag stuff
[09:35:48] <jzaefferer> What needs to be tagged? Or published to npm?
[09:36:48] <tj_vantoll> I have access. https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/164
[09:36:48] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Issue #164 by tjvantoll (1mon 2w ago): Missing `jQuery` return type for several methods
[09:37:51] <tj_vantoll> It's grunt-jquery-content. Scott said he was going to deploy it so I was going to let him in case he had something else locally. I've been unable to contact him for obvious reasons.
[09:38:50] <tj_vantoll> I'll be back on datepicker next week. Also my wife now gets 10% time at her work and I think I've convinced her to help with datepicker.
[09:39:02] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: can you test grunt-jquery-content locally, via `npm link`? If its all good, I'll tag and publish to npm, should end up at 0.10.7
[09:39:13] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: for CLDR I wrote down this: "Unit tests migrated to QUnit, working with AMD, running with Grunt". What are you working on (next)?
[09:39:32] <rxaviers> finish datetime/format
[09:39:53] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: Not today, but I can test it tomorrow morning and get back with you.
[09:40:03] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: cool, that works.
[09:40:18] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: also for datepicker, I've pasted a few notes/TODOs in the agenda doc.
[09:40:40] <jzaefferer> once those are done, I'd like to meet with Alex, Scott, you and me and discuss the API
[09:40:40] <tj_vantoll> ok
[09:41:05] <rxaviers> having implemented datetime/format gave us a pretty good shot with CLDR.
[09:41:11] <jzaefferer> Also more help with datepicker would be great :-)
[09:41:38] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: cool. Looking forward to putting that to use
[09:42:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, what globalize functions you need first? We could prioritize our development based on what we're going to use first...
[09:42:47] <rxaviers> it's always good to have a practical use case
[09:42:48] <rxaviers> :)
[09:43:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: well, whatever datepicker needs
[09:43:22] <jzaefferer> via $.date
[09:43:39] <rxaviers> can you (or someone) list and let me know?
[09:44:05] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/datepicker/external/date.js
[09:44:26] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: you beat me to it :)
[09:44:44] <jzaefferer> .culture().calendar, parseDate, format (for dates)
[09:44:48] <rxaviers> so, parse date and format date?
[09:45:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: spinner uses number formatting and parsing and doesn't need a rewrite, so that might be easier to test: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js#L399
[09:47:13] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: parse date and format date, yes, but also replacements for all the calendar properties, like month names, firstDay etc.
[09:47:54] <rxaviers> good to know the exact piece of info from calendar it needs. But, yeap ok. Thanks I got the big picture
[09:48:20] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: cool, thanks. For datepicker, tj_vantoll is probably is the go-to guy, for spinner ping me
[09:48:31] <rxaviers> ;)
[09:48:35] <jzaefferer> One more thing: Classes option is the only thing where we have absolutely no progress. I don't really know where that got stuck either, apart from petersendidit not really having time anymore. arschmitz I think you've looked at that before - could you take that over?
[09:48:57] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i have started testing it
[09:49:01] <arschmitz> need to finish
[09:49:15] <jzaefferer> Okay, thanks
[09:49:50] <arschmitz> my time is Much more open now so i should be able to finish that up
[09:49:50] <jzaefferer> I think I've got everything into the agenda. Let me know if I missed something.
[09:50:02] <jzaefferer> Thanks everyone!
[09:58:24] <jzaefferer> fnagel kborchers mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll: Any of you interested in joining the dev leads Skype call? Meeting bi-weekly, after the UI meeting, so in two minutes today or in two weeks.
[09:58:47] <jzaefferer> The group is currently pretty random, but a good way to keep up with the whole project, not just one team
[09:58:58] <mikesherov> I'd like to listen in if I can
[09:59:01] <fnagel> Sorry, I've got another skype meeting scheduled for now
[09:59:03] <rxaviers> yeap me too
[09:59:29] <fnagel> I could attend until my contact is available...
[09:59:45] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: can you add me on Skype? joern.zaefferer
[10:01:43] <mikesherov> added jzaefferer
