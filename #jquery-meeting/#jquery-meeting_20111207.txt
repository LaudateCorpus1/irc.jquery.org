[09:01:52] <jzaefferer> meeting time
[09:02:12] * rworth copied agenda from last week
[09:02:27] <jzaefferer> now open to the public :-)
[09:07:46] <rworth> danheberden around?
[09:08:13] <rworth> scott_gonzalez anything on interactions rewrite this week?
[09:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> nope, been busy with the plugins site, haven't really done much of anything for UI in the past week
[09:08:39] <rworth> same for me
[09:08:56] <rworth> scott_gonzalez 1.8.17 status as per agenda?
[09:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> still waiting on Google
[09:09:40] <jzaefferer> that is, paul_irish?
[09:09:53] <paul_irish> my colleague bryan
[09:10:06] <paul_irish> but i did raise an issue yesterday over email to scott
[09:10:08] <paul_irish> that is,
[09:10:08] <jzaefferer> can we offer him beer or something?
[09:10:25] <paul_irish> we have an internal team that makes an open-id login widget sorta thing (its awesome)
[09:10:59] <paul_irish> and they use jquery ui widget factory
[09:11:15] <paul_irish> and that's it.
[09:11:30] <paul_irish> and so they thought it was wasteful to grab all of ui-all when they just need core
[09:11:46] <paul_irish> so.. should the CDN have smaller choices like that available?
[09:12:09] <paul_irish> who is using alllll of UI at once?
[09:12:10] <rworth> doesn't it?
[09:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> we could make them available, but I think people would start linking to individual files even when the have multiple plugins
[09:12:19] <rworth> I mean, grab core and widget
[09:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> which would result in lots of requests
[09:13:01] <paul_irish> YUI decided to stop hosting on google's CDN because we  cant build custom packages of diff modules
[09:13:05] <jzaefferer> we can only offer everything or individual files, there's are too many combination to offer them all, right?
[09:13:21] <rworth> sounds to me like they should just pull in ui.widget from the CDN
[09:13:29] <rworth> they don't even need core
[09:13:38] <jzaefferer> but ui.widget isn't there on its own
[09:14:11] <rworth> I was thinking it was
[09:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> it's not
[09:14:21] <rworth> sorry
[09:14:26] <rworth> I have no problem with individual files
[09:14:51] <rworth> people shouldn't point to 6 sep. files, but they shouldn't do that on their own server either, and yet we provide them in the zip
[09:15:27] <jzaefferer> I can look into extending our ant build to add indiviual (minified) files to the google-cdn target
[09:15:47] <jzaefferer> so paul_irish, we can add that, but what about the 1.8.17 release?
[09:16:02] <jzaefferer> or the submit-to-cdn turnaround time in general?
[09:17:40] <rworth> we offer individual css files, that's why I was confused
[09:17:54] <rworth> forgot we made that change for css but never for js
[09:18:54] <danheberden> rworth yo i'm here
[09:19:05] <rworth> danheberden any infra update?
[09:19:48] <danheberden> rworth haven't heard back from chris about what he can/could acquire for us, so that's a little in the air
[09:20:09] <rworth> that's the new box?
[09:20:14] <danheberden> box(s)
[09:20:15] <danheberden> ya
[09:20:25] <danheberden> like the dpv nitro's or whatever
[09:20:29] <rworth> how bout the new cdn, for like jquery.net?
[09:20:47] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e9f5c1857f9d70e69f08be158b2275736c02647f#commitcomment-750342
[09:20:48] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (2w, 5d ago): Droppable: Cleanup.
[09:20:55] <danheberden> yeah, he's getting it all authorized/in-place
[09:21:11] <rworth> danheberden: on the agenda "view.jqueryui.com doesn't work for 1.8.17"
[09:21:13] <Dave_Stein> which bit are you saying is a bug? that it would count as a drop? or that its using mouseUp instead of dragStop? or that you don't want helper staying?
[09:21:29] <danheberden> rworth NOU
[09:21:30] <jzaefferer> clarkbox is the view guy
[09:21:35] <rworth> ah
[09:21:40] <danheberden> jzaefferer i'll see if it was just a pull problem
[09:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> that it breaks with stopPropagation is a bug
[09:22:01] <jzaefferer> danheberden: I can probably do that, too :-)
[09:22:06] <Dave_Stein> i thought we agred returning false from the callback on stop would keep the helper there?
[09:22:16] <Dave_Stein> whenw e were on phone with Corey that one time
[09:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> if they prevent default
[09:22:32] <danheberden> yeah "cannot remove" errors al over
[09:22:54] <jzaefferer> what dir are you looking at?
[09:23:07] <Dave_Stein> oh sorry, used wrong word. replace stop propogration with prevent default in that comment
[09:23:08] <jzaefferer> this? /srv/view.jquery.org
[09:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> yes, prevent default in a drag stop should still be a drop
[09:23:19] <danheberden> yeah, the update.sh is what gets called
[09:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> prevent default in a drop should prevent the drop
[09:23:52] <jzaefferer> "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits." <- that shouldn't happen, eh?
[09:24:06] <Dave_Stein> so if i have mouseup triggering drop, why would i change it to dragstop?
[09:24:27] <danheberden> jzaefferer rworth it's updating currently
[09:24:38] <rworth> danheberden thanksman
[09:24:49] <Dave_Stein> if anything i should change it to "dragDrop" or some other name like that to work into your file that you recently added
[09:24:59] <danheberden> http://view.jqueryui.com/1.8.17/
[09:25:01] <Dave_Stein> oh what was it? the one that abstracts those
[09:25:14] <jzaefferer> danheberden: but there are uncommited changes, right? I confused that with the actual pulling, should push then
[09:25:19] <scott_gonzalez> ui.interaction
[09:25:30] <Dave_Stein> sometimes i wonder why i can't think of the obvious ;)
[09:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> I still think droppable can just proxy the draggable methods
[09:26:44] <Dave_Stein> how does one get access to the others methods? is it stored somewhere in widget namespace?
[09:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> $.ui.draggable.prototype.X
[09:27:54] <Dave_Stein> okay
[09:28:22] <Dave_Stein> i'll see what i can do with some proxies to override the method for that part and the $('*').live crap im doing
[09:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:28:43] <Dave_Stein> i guess i'll hop to sortable next
[09:28:58] <gnarf> jzaefferer, sounds like it hasn't fetched but has pulled
[09:29:24] <Dave_Stein> i can't wait to get the use case of using draggable, droppable, sortable ( with a helper ) together without those drop bugs
[09:29:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I think someone just edited stuff on the server and didn't push back to github
[09:29:47] <gnarf> on view?
[09:30:00] <Dave_Stein> i blocked them out of my mind, but i know they are what got me started on 2 haha
[09:30:03] <gnarf> reset it
[09:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:30:16] <gnarf> i really doubt anyone was editing code on view
[09:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, hopefuly not
[09:30:26] <gnarf> at least inside jquery-ui
[09:30:30] <gnarf> and if they were
[09:30:41] * gnarf shrugs - reset it to origin/master anyway
[09:30:51] <Dave_Stein> anyway im off for lunch. see you guys later. gnarf, i havent spoken to you in ages. i miss you. lol
[09:32:46] <jzaefferer> I mean just the web-view-org repo
[09:33:03] <jzaefferer> github.com:jquery/web-view-jquery-org.git
[09:33:17] <gnarf> oh
[09:33:25] <gnarf> well then yeah, maybe it didnt get pushed
[09:33:37] <gnarf> prolly clark
[09:34:00] <gnarf> that might be the diff for the branches/tags folders not being there
[09:34:02] <jzaefferer> but then those commits are actually on github
[09:34:11] <jzaefferer> no idea, I'll let clarkbox handle that
[09:34:18] <gnarf> is it still out of date after a git fetch?
[09:34:20] <jzaefferer> danheberden says its fixed, what do I care
[09:35:09] <danheberden> gnarf jzaefferer efs/pull/520/head does not point to a valid object!
[09:35:17] <danheberden> s/efs/refs/ hmm
[09:35:26] <jzaefferer> yeah, no idea what that is about
[09:35:44] <gnarf> never seen that error b4, whats it on?
[09:36:51] <danheberden> gnarf - not entirely sure, it's a python script
[09:37:16] <jzaefferer> gnarf: you should also get that when you pull jquery-ui
[09:37:22] <danheberden> weird, i did a git pull manually
[09:37:30] <danheberden> and it pulled all kinds of new stuff
[09:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> we're using `git fetch -t` for the plugins site to ensure we always get all tags
[09:38:13] <danheberden> does it look better now?
[09:39:10] <jzaefferer> ~/dev/jquery-ui [git:master+?] $ git pull
[09:39:10] <jzaefferer> error: refs/pull/520/head does not point to a valid object!
[09:39:10] <jzaefferer> Already up-to-date.
[09:40:13] <rworth> jzaefferer: that error has just been happening the last few weeks/months
[09:40:15] <IvanKuzev> about the dialog size animation? is there such a thing ?
[09:40:46] <gnarf> fetch -t might be the issue
[09:40:48] <jzaefferer> rworth: right, but gnarf apparently never noticed
[09:40:54] <rworth> ah
[09:41:06] <RTPMatt> sounds like your head is pointing to a commit that is not there.  should be reset to point to the latest commit?
[09:41:11] <gnarf> its been that long since i pulled prolly :/
[09:41:21] <gnarf> is there a pull/520 branch or something?
[09:41:58] <rworth> IvanKuzev: ask in #jqueryui-dev
[09:43:12] <gnarf> i'll bbiab - gotta restart my comp
[09:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think that's a GitHub bug
[09:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> I submitted a bug to them about it
[09:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> haven't gotten any response other than "we'll look into it"
[09:46:37] <jzaefferer> kborchers, did you get around to checking the selectmenu/menu issue Felix reported?
[09:47:01] <kborchers> i am actually working on that now
[09:47:29] <kborchers> trying to find the best way to fix his issue but still work in a useful way on its own
[09:47:36] <kborchers> menu that is
[09:47:51] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[09:48:00] <kborchers> focusing the first item is how we show that the menu has focus but that messes with selectmenu
[09:48:02] <jzaefferer> other then that, Dan and Felix are working on unit tests
[09:48:26] <kborchers> i'm close though ... hope to have something today
[09:49:06] <jzaefferer> gnarf: what about mask and timepicker? let's land it this year!
[09:50:00] <gnarf> jzaefferer: agreed - should be able to get some demos done and in here soon
[09:50:00] <jzaefferer> kborchers: as for menubar, good to go from my point of view
[09:50:21] <gnarf> along with the datepicker as a mask attempt
[09:50:31] <kborchers> ok, thanks. i'll merge later today unless i hear from anyone else jzaefferer
[09:55:23] <rworth> anything else?
[09:58:32] <rworth> adjourned, thanks all
[09:59:13] <jzaefferer> confirm
