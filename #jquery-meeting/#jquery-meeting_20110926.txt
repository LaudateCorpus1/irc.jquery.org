[08:57:18] <JohnResig> Hey all
[08:57:25] <JohnResig> Meeting will be starting in a few
[09:01:58] <timmywil> hihi
[09:02:26] <addyosmani> hai
[09:02:39] <rwaldron> heyo
[09:03:03] <DaveMethvin> thanks for the qunit fix timmywil
[09:03:28] <DaveMethvin> we're now on "qunit classic"
[09:03:34] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig are you here?
[09:03:34] <timmywil> not so much a fix as a call for action on QUnit :)
[09:04:34] <addyosmani> he was here a few mins ago DaveMethvin
[09:04:44] <gnarf> i posted a comment on that commit in qunit
[09:05:15] <timmywil> welcome jrburke
[09:05:23] <JohnResig> yep - I'm here
[09:05:27] <jrburke> Hi timmywil
[09:05:42] <JohnResig> timmywil: what's up with qunit?
[09:06:10] <timmywil> JohnResig: they made a change to the start/stop function that effects/offset has a problem with
[09:06:15] <timmywil> functions*
[09:06:21] <JohnResig> ah
[09:07:20] <timmywil> as far as we can tell, it's not an issue with our tests
[09:08:44] <timmywil> open 1.7 tix http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.7&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&report=206&order=priority
[09:09:02] <gnarf> my 2 blockers have pulls up
[09:09:17] <timmywil> i'll be working on getText tonight
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron and i have just about got propHooks done but i can't get the unit test to behave in IE
[09:09:56] <rwaldron> Grind
[09:10:35] <DaveMethvin> is there anything else that needs to land before we can declare a beta?
[09:10:51] <DaveMethvin> some of the others are just bug fixes and we can get them afterwards
[09:11:53] <timmywil> event hooks, gnarf's pulls, and getText should probably go in
[09:12:03] <timmywil> docs#8539
[09:12:04] <bot-t> [#8539] Sizzle cache collision in browsers without querySelectorAll (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/8539
[09:12:09] <timmywil> JohnResig: you have time for that?
[09:12:42] <DaveMethvin> i dunno that i'd call that a blocker, seems pretty obscure
[09:13:22] <JohnResig> yeah, I'm not sure if that's really a blocker, either
[09:13:28] <timmywil> good opint
[09:13:29] <timmywil> point
[09:13:34] <DaveMethvin> what if we aim for a beta on Wednesday? It can't be much later since most of us are going to the conf
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> we can land the important stuff and do cleanup afterwards
[09:13:57] <DaveMethvin> i'd really like to get this out for the public to play with
[09:14:02] <timmywil> but we can make that expando version specific
[09:14:03] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm done for that
[09:14:23] <timmywil> wed sounds good
[09:14:24] <rwaldron> down*
[09:14:33] <DaveMethvin> I can make a post covering the stuff that addyosmani didn't cover already -- btw thanks addy!
[09:14:41] <addyosmani> np DaveMethvin :)
[09:15:55] <timmywil> JohnResig: is "done" the only thing that gets attached to the element?
[09:16:11] <JohnResig> hmm
[09:16:13] <JohnResig> I think so
[09:17:49] <timmywil> we could do something similar to jQuery.expando
[09:18:18] <timmywil> make sure anything sizzle attaches is under one thing
[09:19:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah seems like the expando approach should work with some random number
[09:20:25] <timmywil> Regarding that pull, I'm not sure how setting done to Math.random() would fix the problem
[09:21:18] <timmywil> though it might certainly confuse Sizzle
[09:21:58] <DaveMethvin> you say that like it's a BAD thing timmywil
[09:22:03] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:22:03] <timmywil> haha
[09:22:14] <timmywil> anyway, I'll set that high priority and I can grab it if you want JohnResig
[09:23:06] <timmywil> or if you have time for it, please feel free
[09:23:16] <timmywil> :)
[09:23:36] <DaveMethvin> the only other thing on that list i really wanted to do was be able to run the unit tests in xhtml (with a real xml+xhtml content type) but i am not sure how to do it effectively cross-browser   ... and IE6/7/8 will ignore it anyway
[09:24:05] <DaveMethvin> seems like we'd have to deliver the files by php and push out the right header
[09:24:10] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: don't we already do that?
[09:24:35] <DaveMethvin> the doctype is there but browsers don't treat it like xml without the right header, at least some of them
[09:24:44] <DaveMethvin> that's how we broke support.js
[09:24:46] <timmywil> ah
[09:25:12] <DaveMethvin> well it's not really a blocker either so we can certainly do the beta without it
[09:25:25] <DaveMethvin> if we break xhtml again i am sure we'll hear about it :)
[09:25:34] <timmywil> true
[09:26:03] <DaveMethvin> anything else we need to tackle here?
[09:26:28] <DaveMethvin> i want to land the propHooks stuff asap but this damned ie failure is cramping my style
[09:26:59] <DaveMethvin> since we can't unit test it very effectively i think it needs as much testing as possible in beta
[09:27:05] <timmywil> i'll have a getText change by tomorrow
[09:27:14] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[09:27:26] <timmywil> and if you get propHooks set, we can land gnarf's pulls and rollout a beta
[09:27:41] <DaveMethvin> and there will be great rejoicing
[09:27:53] <timmywil> even by tomorrow if we're ready
[09:28:29] <DaveMethvin> maybe late tomorrow, mainly i want to have an overview of what has been added so ppl can test effectively
[09:29:02] <gnarf> oh hey
[09:29:14] <timmywil> hey
[09:29:19] <gnarf> I added a third param to .stop()
[09:29:22] <gnarf> to take a queue
[09:29:30] <gnarf> curious if anyone had an issue with that
[09:29:39] <DaveMethvin> as long as it's backcompat, no
[09:29:40] <timmywil> seems like it goes with animate queues
[09:29:49] <gnarf> yeah - that was my feeling too
[09:29:53] <timmywil> sounds necessary to me
[09:30:00] <gnarf> and without any param - it stops all queues
[09:30:27] <gnarf> or without that third param
[09:30:29] <DaveMethvin> so if there are any changes you think need to be  high profile let me know so i can emphasize them
[09:30:44] <DaveMethvin> addy did a lot of it already so i can just reference his writeup
[09:30:51] <DaveMethvin> but i wanted to cover .on() and .off()
[09:31:02] <DaveMethvin> plus any other important stuff
[09:31:04] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: did you see addy's post?
[09:31:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:31:09] <timmywil> might help you with ours
[09:31:10] <timmywil> kk
[09:31:34] <timmywil> yea, you just said that
[09:31:43] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:31:48] <timmywil> OK
[09:32:06] <timmywil> all good?
[09:32:18] <DaveMethvin> i think timmywil is getting meeting fatigue, we'd better quit! :P
[09:32:54] <timmywil> hehe, i don't read good
[09:33:03] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron you got a minute? i'll meet you back in -dev
[09:33:24] <timmywil> thanks everybody
[09:33:34] <DaveMethvin> on to 1.7!!
