[14:02:23] <agcolom> hi everyone from mobile team
[14:02:33] <arschmitz> agcolom: thank you for opening room
[14:02:41] <agcolom> I have to run in 15 min so please make sure notes are in :-)
[14:02:42] <cgack> howdy
[14:02:49] <apsdehal> hello
[14:02:54] <agcolom> I'll try to catch up with uploading them!
[14:03:07] <arschmitz> cgack: apsdehal sfrisk gabrielschulhof jasperdegroot cogwurx meeting time
[14:03:45] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:04:01] <agcolom> another 31 issues closed this week!
[14:04:10] <gabrielschulhof> Nice!
[14:04:24] <cogwurx> hello
[14:04:25] <arschmitz> yeah down to 200
[14:04:29] <cogwurx> YAY
[14:04:34] <sfrisk_> huzzuh!
[14:04:37] <arschmitz> *under
[14:05:07] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:05:21] <arschmitz> changes we needed landed in selectmenu landed
[14:05:27] <sfrisk> bah, no laptop policy in my grooming meeting I'm in
[14:05:29] <sfrisk> guess I'm out
[14:05:43] <gabrielschulhof> sfrisk: L8R
[14:05:58] <sfrisk> see everyone later
[14:06:17] <agcolom> see you later sarah!
[14:06:25] <gabrielschulhof> So, where do I grab the files from? Tip of UI master?
[14:06:32] <arschmitz> master yes
[14:06:36] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Can do.
[14:06:44] <arschmitz> rc3 got delayed
[14:06:49] <arschmitz> more bugs to fix
[14:08:07] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: so once you pul that in and land associated changes
[14:08:12] <arschmitz> selectmenu should be good
[14:08:22] <gabrielschulhof> Yep.
[14:08:37] <gabrielschulhof> It should be pretty simple. I should simply be able to remove the workaround I added.
[14:08:45] <arschmitz> yup
[14:08:46] <gabrielschulhof> The thing with the second class key just for corners.
[14:08:50] <arschmitz> because its just magic now
[14:08:56] <gabrielschulhof> Yep :)
[14:09:01] <gabrielschulhof> Just Magicâ„¢
[14:09:35] <gabrielschulhof> Eeexcellent!
[14:10:06] <arschmitz> ok sounds good
[14:10:15] <arschmitz> the other changes in UI should not effect us
[14:10:20] <arschmitz> they are for spinner and dialog
[14:10:42] <gabrielschulhof> Oh! I noticed our flipswitch is messed up!
[14:11:04] <arschmitz> what about it?
[14:11:21] <gabrielschulhof> The styling, at least. The native element is visible next to the flipswitch.
[14:11:56] <gabrielschulhof> OK, wait, it looks good.
[14:12:04] <gabrielschulhof> I did see something odd though.
[14:12:24] <arschmitz> yeah i dont see an issue here
[14:12:34] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-dev/demos/flipswitch/
[14:12:50] <gabrielschulhof> OK ... maybe it was during a time when I was messing something up.
[14:13:08] <gabrielschulhof> After all, I was working with selectmenu, and a flipswitch can be based on a selectmenu.
[14:13:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:13:51] <gabrielschulhof> Maybe it was double-enhancing or something.
[14:13:53] <arschmitz> well if you see something open an issue
[14:13:58] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, definitely.
[14:14:14] <arschmitz> apsdehal: any update on phantom 2
[14:14:35] <apsdehal> I have opened a PR.
[14:15:15] <apsdehal> Let me check what was the latest state of it
[14:15:19] <arschmitz> looks like test are failing though
[14:16:08] <apsdehal> It must be failing on init if they are. Checking
[14:16:29] <apsdehal> There was something else I wanted to discuss also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7036
[14:16:57] <apsdehal> Views on this and how we should actually handle dismissible
[14:17:09] <arschmitz> apsdehal: can you add that to the agenda :-)
[14:18:32] <gabrielschulhof> Well, yeah, dismissible = false implies that we have to swallow mouse events.
[14:18:33] <arschmitz> that should be re-opened though
[14:18:40] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, it's essentially modal at that point.
[14:18:54] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. It's not fixed, and we haven't refused to fix it.
[14:19:36] <arschmitz> but we should only be binding the events we care about
[14:20:10] <apsdehal> Not all the events guy mentioned should be unregistered though
[14:20:13] <arschmitz> if a binding is not needed in that case we should not handle it
[14:20:30] <apsdehal> Second thing is easily manageable though
[14:20:33] <arschmitz> yeah im not saying hes completely right
[14:20:46] <arschmitz> but we should never be telling people to unbind widget events on their own
[14:20:48] <arschmitz> thats bad
[14:20:57] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, definitely.
[14:21:10] <apsdehal> Should we have a function to unregister then?
[14:21:12] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, we could just forego binding to them in the first place.
[14:21:12] <arschmitz> .off wont work when its done with _on either
[14:21:14] <arschmitz> no
[14:21:21] <arschmitz> they shouldnt not be un registering them them selves
[14:21:41] * gabrielschulhof 's head explodes. NEGATIVE OVERLOAD!
[14:21:56] <arschmitz> panel should do it directly or it should not be supported
[14:22:07] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: the no was to the function idea sorry
[14:22:10] <apsdehal> A new attribute then?
[14:22:19] <arschmitz> apsdehal: no we should just fix the widget
[14:22:34] <apsdehal> So what events should not be registered?
[14:22:35] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec ... if we don't want the panel to be dismissible, we should simply skip the code that registers the swipe handlers, for example, right?
[14:22:44] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes
[14:22:48] <arschmitz> exactly
[14:23:03] <gabrielschulhof> Same for all the other event handlers we normally use to decide that the panel should be dismissed.
[14:23:09] <arschmitz> yup
[14:23:22] <arschmitz> pagehide is an interesting case though
[14:23:29] <apsdehal> Code is really not that good, would require a lot of changes
[14:23:31] <arschmitz> as thats not a user interaction
[14:23:38] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Sounds simple enough - just put an if (this.options.dismissible) { this._on(...); }
[14:23:49] <arschmitz> apsdehal: yeah what gabrielschulhof said
[14:24:03] <apsdehal> Well, that brings me to second discussion, a lot of issues relate to current panel code.
[14:24:18] <apsdehal> Panel needs a serious rewrite
[14:24:20] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, we need to know when the page goes away so as to hide the panel before it does.
[14:24:31] <arschmitz> yup its been bad from the get go it was kinda forced in by former team members and never finished
[14:24:31] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal: yes it does
[14:24:37] <arschmitz> needs a ful re-write
[14:24:49] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: unless its an external panel
[14:24:53] <apsdehal> > 60 issues will be fixed with panel rewrite
[14:25:02] <arschmitz> in whcih case you may want it to stay through a page change
[14:25:12] <arschmitz> apsdehal: no suprise
[14:25:18] <jasperdegroot> I think we have panel rewrite on the roadmap for 1.6
[14:25:24] <arschmitz> its been a POC pain from the beginning
[14:25:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: can attest
[14:25:32] <gabrielschulhof> Whew ... I dunno how the transitions would handle a panel hanging over the page.
[14:25:38] <arschmitz> its been a horrible nightmare for both of us
[14:25:46] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:25:52] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: should not matter its outside pagecontainer
[14:26:10] <gabrielschulhof> Not currently. It's in the body and the body is the pagecontainer.
[14:26:22] <arschmitz> sorry i meant outside page
[14:26:34] <arschmitz> pretty sure i did this on an app once
[14:26:44] <gabrielschulhof> I agree that it shouldn't matter.
[14:26:59] <gabrielschulhof> Well, OK. Nothing we can do for now.
[14:27:09] <gabrielschulhof> The problems shall remain until 1.6 :(
[14:27:10] <arschmitz> but i think that still different
[14:27:23] <arschmitz> dismissable is really about user interaction
[14:27:34] <arschmitz> page change is not a user interaction
[14:27:41] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, yeah ... definitely. Agreed there.
[14:27:52] <apsdehal> Yes, agreed only mouse events for now
[14:27:53] <jasperdegroot> maybe we have to deprecate panel in 1.5 so we have our hands free to do a complete rewrite for 1.6
[14:28:17] <gabrielschulhof> Will the API be very different though?
[14:28:25] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: if there is a panel and will be a panel we cant really
[14:28:26] <apsdehal> Though, as I see over in issues, panel is one most used widgets
[14:28:41] <arschmitz> its not deprecation its a re-write
[14:28:53] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, and if it has the same API, we're not really breaking API.
[14:28:56] <arschmitz> we went through that with slider and were forced to reverse decision as you recall
[14:29:03] <arschmitz> even if its not same api
[14:29:11] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:29:13] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Can you guide me later in free time how to start with rewrite I am ready to take it up?
[14:29:26] <arschmitz> apsdehal: we are blocked on that
[14:29:31] <arschmitz> by pep integration in UI
[14:29:35] <jasperdegroot> complicated thing might be the panel classes option which is not compatible with the new classes option
[14:29:36] <gabrielschulhof> Well, if the API differs we need to deprecate the parts of the panel API which will be different.
[14:29:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: we dont know that yet
[14:29:58] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that should definitely go.
[14:30:07] <arschmitz> but deprecation of that stuff is generally part of re-write
[14:30:11] <arschmitz> just like button checkbox et all
[14:30:13] <gabrielschulhof> Well, we know one point of difference: the classes option.
[14:30:30] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thats been fixed already
[14:30:34] <arschmitz> it had to for 1.5
[14:30:46] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[14:30:55] <gabrielschulhof> So, the old class keys are already deprecated?
[14:30:56] <arschmitz> we had no choice
[14:31:03] <arschmitz> kinda
[14:31:11] <arschmitz> it was just a plain breaking change no real option
[14:31:22] <arschmitz> because the widget factory it self addes new classes option
[14:31:35] <gabrielschulhof> Right ...
[14:31:35] <arschmitz> so setting it would have caused chaos
[14:31:53] <arschmitz> im not sure we could backcompat classes option
[14:32:03] <gabrielschulhof> I think I tried. It's insane.
[14:32:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:32:13] <gabrielschulhof> You can't really distinguish between old and new class keys.
[14:32:18] <arschmitz> yup
[14:32:23] <arschmitz> and the factory handles it
[14:32:28] <arschmitz> so we have no real control
[14:32:35] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, if you assume that old class keys have no dashes whereas new ones do, that's kind of a hackish distinction.
[14:32:50] <arschmitz> would still require changes to factory
[14:33:00] <arschmitz> otherwise setting option would blow up
[14:33:21] <gabrielschulhof> Not necessarily, because the old-style class keys are not associated with any elements.
[14:33:31] <arschmitz> true
[14:33:35] <gabrielschulhof> So, setting the old-style option would do nothing.
[14:33:37] <arschmitz> either way we didnt do it
[14:33:44] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, not worth the trouble.
[14:33:59] <gabrielschulhof> ... and if panel is so desirable a widget, I believe it will remain desirable.
[14:34:06] <arschmitz> so main panel blocker is pep
[14:34:12] <arschmitz> we wanted to add dragability etc
[14:34:25] <arschmitz> which we cant do without ui being based on pep
[14:34:39] <gabrielschulhof> I vote to punt.
[14:35:32] <arschmitz> punt on what?
[14:35:39] <gabrielschulhof> On panel changes that require pep.
[14:36:03] <gabrielschulhof> We have what we have and it's gonna have to do for 1.5.
[14:36:06] <arschmitz> so you think we should re-write panel with out that stuff then re-write again with it?
[14:36:15] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: we are talking about the re-write
[14:36:18] <arschmitz> thats not 1.5
[14:36:19] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK.
[14:36:20] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:36:33] <gabrielschulhof> No, then we should definitely re-write with pep.
[14:36:48] <arschmitz> status of pep in ui
[14:36:50] <gabrielschulhof> When you said "blocker" I figured you meant wrt. 1.5.
[14:36:59] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611
[14:37:03] <apsdehal> There are many other rewrites also waiting, like slider :(
[14:37:12] <arschmitz> slider is part of ui
[14:37:18] <arschmitz> or will be
[14:37:30] <arschmitz> so thats directly waiting on someone to re-write the ui one
[14:37:37] <arschmitz> to work for both of us
[14:38:11] <apsdehal> I also confirmed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8334
[14:38:36] <apsdehal> Listview's refresh also needs to be fixed as I looked into source code
[14:38:55] <apsdehal> It really doesn't consider many things to do an actual refresh, lol
[14:39:04] <arschmitz> thats another one pending a re-write
[14:39:11] <arschmitz> though far less major
[14:39:19] <arschmitz> its just an old widget that needs a good once over
[14:39:45] <apsdehal> Every widget should have a proper refresh method though
[14:40:01] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec ... with the new code, you have to add the icon yourself, like <span ...></span>
[14:40:26] <gabrielschulhof> ... oh, no, wait, we have the icon option.
[14:40:30] <gabrielschulhof> per-item, no less.
[14:40:35] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:40:40] <arschmitz> its just a bug
[14:40:49] <gabrielschulhof> Well, since I did listview, I can fix this.
[14:41:04] <apsdehal> arschmitz: gabrielschulhof Can you provide the guys a better workaround?
[14:41:15] <arschmitz> i dont think there is one
[14:41:23] <arschmitz> its a bug we just need to fix
[14:41:37] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so one more thing.
[14:41:37] <arschmitz> until then to update you need to change it your self
[14:41:40] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: Willing to take it up?
[14:41:46] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: You confirmed this in 1.5-dev as well?
[14:42:14] <apsdehal> Yes, I checked the source code for 1.5-dev
[14:42:20] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Thanks!
[14:42:27] <gabrielschulhof> I assigned myself.
[14:43:31] <arschmitz> cool
[14:44:20] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/js/widgets/listview.js#L161
[14:44:32] <apsdehal> Fails the check here itself, where inside the checking happens
[14:45:19] <apsdehal> Passes in the case of create due to condition being true
[14:45:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: cogwurx any updates on demos?
[14:45:30] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, right.
[14:45:42] <jasperdegroot> no updates from me
[14:45:56] <cogwurx> neither from me
[14:46:00] <arschmitz> ok
[14:46:07] <arschmitz> cgack: any update on the navbar docs?
[14:47:21] <cgack> arschmitz: I only got a brief chance to get a look at them and start working on the "more button", need to get the sites setup local so i can see them
[14:47:44] <arschmitz> ok
[14:49:31] <arschmitz> anyonr have anything else
[14:49:41] <cgack> next week might settle down. no conferences for a while... thats all for me
[14:49:48] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Phantomjs build is passing, random fail in 5th set
[14:50:05] <apsdehal> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/129761060
[14:50:29] <arschmitz> cool
[14:50:40] <apsdehal> THough I should confirm it again
[14:57:12] <gabrielschulhof> I have to go. L8R all!
[14:57:45] <jasperdegroot> later
