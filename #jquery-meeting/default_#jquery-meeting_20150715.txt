[08:35:33] <jzaefferer> leobalter: are you around?
[08:35:41] <jzaefferer> something you want to discuss about QUnit?
[09:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[09:00:04] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz fnagel jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers_ scott_gonzalez tjvantoll
[09:00:14] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:43] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> So I finally finished the datepicker merge :-)
[09:02:03] <fnagel> nice!
[09:02:04] <arschmitz> yay
[09:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to figure out what's going on with that date module.
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like it either needs to just move into calendar or actually become an external.
[09:03:08] <fnagel> you talk about $.date ?
[09:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:04:25] <jzaefferer> Its currently in ui/date.js, right?
[09:04:32] <fnagel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/datepicker/external/date.js
[09:05:12] <fnagel> Wow, that merge is huge...
[09:05:38] <jzaefferer> oh, right, external but not really external
[09:05:53] <fnagel> what would be really external?
[09:06:02] <jzaefferer> separate repository
[09:06:10] <jzaefferer> publish to npm etc. pp.
[09:06:25] <jzaefferer> I think that's what Scott is referring to
[09:06:40] <jzaefferer> "Showing  340 changed files  with 105,020 additions and 9,057 deletions."
[09:06:42] <jzaefferer> wat
[09:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> We shouldn't have files in external that originate in our repo.
[09:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it was a big merge.
[09:07:19] <jzaefferer> (and that doesn't event include button rewrite or core-split)
[09:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> There were almost 200 commits.
[09:07:33] <arschmitz> or demos
[09:07:37] <jzaefferer> !
[09:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> At this point, datepicker will just keep getting merges.
[09:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> It has lived too long and we've done too many big changes in master.
[09:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> So we can't do sane rebases anymore.
[09:08:45] <fnagel> ok, good to know
[09:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> So, I'll have time to look at button again.
[09:12:24] <fnagel> next steps would be updating globalize and fix the demos / tests. rxaviers wanted to help out with this
[09:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> Though perhaps not until after India.
[09:13:07] <jzaefferer> When's that?
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> The 27th.
[09:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully I'll have time to do it while I'm there.
[09:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> Since I'll be there for a whole week.
[09:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> What's the status of demos?
[09:17:47] <arschmitz> waiting on review
[09:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer is doing that?
[09:18:29] <arschmitz> as far as i know
[09:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: CSS dependencies?
[09:20:14] <jzaefferer> am I?
[09:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno, are you
[09:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[09:21:02] <jzaefferer> This is still bad: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/113/files#diff-35b4a816e0441e6a375cd925af50752cR182
[09:21:18] <jzaefferer> I suggested merging the replaceWith() and after() into a single replaceWith()
[09:21:28] <arschmitz> right ill fix that
[09:21:31] <jzaefferer> I think I was waiting for that to land, then would try to test again
[09:21:34] <arschmitz> the main repo should be good though
[09:21:37] <arschmitz> ok
[09:21:44] <jzaefferer> yeah, didn't notice anything there based on diff
[09:21:51] <jzaefferer> but want to actually test stuff on the site
[09:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers?
[09:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> Guess he's not around.
[09:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: The core split is ready for another round of review now, right?
[09:24:41] <arschmitz> im fixing what you suggested for version
[09:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:25:26] <arschmitz> iv added it as a dependency everywhere but need to remove anyplace that sets $.ui
[09:25:31] <arschmitz> before i push it
[09:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[09:25:53] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[09:26:21] <jzaefferer> looking at roadmap..
[09:26:58] <jzaefferer> I'm gonna look at the DB updates Rafael did along with the demo testing
[09:27:07] <jzaefferer> Probably on Friday, I'll be away all day tomorrow
[09:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:27:27] <jzaefferer> Rest looks good, button is still the biggest blocker
[09:28:49] <jzaefferer> tis all
[09:29:50] <jzaefferer> Thanks everyone!
