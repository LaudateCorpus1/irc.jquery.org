[12:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz awayrxaviers  fnagel  jzaefferer
[12:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone here?
[12:05:23] <fnagel> yes sorr
[12:05:30] <fnagel> just got a phone call of a client
[12:05:39] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[12:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz said he'll be another five minutes or so. He's stuck running errands right now.
[12:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> There's been good progress on fnagel's datepicker PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1755
[12:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> I need to do another round of review now that he has pushed updates.
[12:09:14] <scott_gonzalez> I remembered that we don't have auto-closing pending tickets any more.
[12:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Tickets set to pending used to close after two weeks if there was no response from the reporter.
[12:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> Since the Trac upgrade, we haven't had that functionality.
[12:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> So I went through and closed the old pending tickets.
[12:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ask Ryan Ollos (Trac core dev who has been helping us) if he can reimplement that functionality.
[12:12:01] <fnagel> ok
[12:12:09] <fnagel> I'm here now
[12:12:59] <arschmitz> Here now
[12:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Any progress on the datepicker iOS 10 bug?
[12:18:57] <arschmitz> Ha ha I just responded to this and totally the wrong channel not paying attention
[12:19:35] <arschmitz> And ensure no I didn't look at it I keep forgetting about that one I need to actually check my assigned tickets when I don't think I have anything to work on for UI
[12:20:09] <arschmitz> I'm terrible
[12:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> Custom Selectmenu with _renderItem crashes when calling "refresh": https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15075
[12:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't confirmed this yet.
[12:25:56] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/vuvara/edit?html,js,output
[12:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is this a 1.12 change for menu?
[12:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.12/#require-wrappers-for-each-menu-item
[12:28:46] <arschmitz> yes i think thats it
[12:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/vuvara/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:30:50] <arschmitz> thats just mine?
[12:31:28] <scott_gonzalez> weir
[12:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[12:31:42] <fnagel> nah, seems to crash when using the original _renderItem code too
[12:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder why it didn't generate a new URL for the snapshot.
[12:32:21] <arschmitz> fnagel: does not for me
[12:32:53] <fnagel> http://jsbin.com/xutanosipi/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> So strange. It refuses to save mine.
[12:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'll have to start over.
[12:33:07] <arschmitz> ok so this is when you extend selectmenu at all
[12:33:48] <arschmitz> because refresh is fine with original selectmenu widget
[12:34:14] <fnagel> seems related to the widget itself
[12:34:33] <arschmitz> fnagel: weird
[12:34:34] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/vuvara/edit?html,js,output
[12:34:41] <arschmitz> that works fine
[12:34:47] <fnagel> jep
[12:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/pufevezoja/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:34:56] <arschmitz> i dont get whats going on here
[12:35:02] <scott_gonzalez> jsbin is having serious issues for me.
[12:35:46] <arschmitz> fnagel: yours and mine are identical as far as i can tell
[12:35:50] <arschmitz> but yours fails and mine works
[12:36:10] <fnagel> something's wrong
[12:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel's fails because he has reference errors.
[12:36:49] <arschmitz> oh $ul
[12:36:50] <arschmitz> yup
[12:36:53] <fnagel> http://jsbin.com/pufevezoja/1/edit?html,js,output works now
[12:36:55] <scott_gonzalez> He kept the function definition from the original
[12:37:01] <fnagel> right
[12:37:03] <fnagel> sorry
[12:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, http://jsbin.com/pufevezoja/1/edit?html,js,output has the minimal change to make it work.
[12:37:33] <arschmitz> ok so yes this is just the 1.12 menu wrapper issue
[12:37:45] <arschmitz> so not actually an issue
[12:37:56] <arschmitz> but maybe add it to the upgrade guide
[12:38:24] <arschmitz> specifically for selectmenu with custom rendering
[12:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/309
[12:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/160
[12:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:50:54] <fnagel> just a question
[12:51:13] <fnagel> any idea why the timezone issue hits now for datepicker / calendar branch but did not before?
[12:51:30] <fnagel> seems strange to me, or do I miss something
[12:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure. We've had plenty of timezone issues in the past though.
[12:52:00] <fnagel> travis unit tests fail due to timezone issues (that the idea atm)
[12:52:30] <fnagel> so, its probably caused by some change related to travis?
[12:52:45] <scott_gonzalez> could be
[12:52:52] <fnagel> ok
[12:53:20] <fnagel> everything else in the PR
[12:53:23] <fnagel> thanks!
[12:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
