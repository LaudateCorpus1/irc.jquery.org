[11:01:40] <cgack> howdy
[11:01:54] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:02:56] <sfrisk> allo
[11:04:27] <arschmitz> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=54
[11:05:27] <arschmitz> Ok lets get started
[11:05:56] <arschmitz> UI classes is ready to land and has thumbs up from jzaefferer just waiting for the ok from scott_gonzalez
[11:06:15] <cgack> awesome
[11:06:31] <arschmitz> so that will simplify things a lot not having to worry about api / implmentations
[11:06:40] <arschmitz> and takes one step out of our crazy rebase chain
[11:09:16] <arschmitz> cgack: has the tests passing i just need to review the fixes
[11:09:38] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i saw some commits on the theme branch
[11:09:40] <cgack> found one remaining set of tests that weren't passing
[11:09:48] <arschmitz> cgack: ok
[11:09:54] <jasperdegroot> yeah, made some progress
[11:10:16] <jasperdegroot> there are some things we need to look into first before i can finish work on controlgroup and checkboxradio
[11:10:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok like?
[11:11:09] <jasperdegroot> one problem is horizontal controlgroups
[11:11:38] <arschmitz> selects wont work until that widget gets classes
[11:12:16] <jasperdegroot> sorry, i mean vertical controlgroups
[11:12:27] <arschmitz> ok
[11:12:27] <jasperdegroot> they all get horizontal controlgroup class now
[11:12:42] <arschmitz> in latest?
[11:12:58] <jasperdegroot> yes
[11:13:04] <arschmitz> do you mean now in mobile or in ui
[11:13:50] <jasperdegroot> http://view.jquerymobile.com/ui-1-12/demos/controlgroup/
[11:14:03] <jasperdegroot> check the classes of that first (vertical) controlgroup
[11:15:35] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: it does not have the orientation option set
[11:15:46] <arschmitz> so its default to horizontal
[11:17:00] <jasperdegroot> ah ok, the default has changed
[11:17:11] <arschmitz> the option name also changed
[11:17:28] <arschmitz> there is backcompat for that
[11:18:00] <arschmitz> there is no way to backcompat the change in default though
[11:18:30] <jasperdegroot> but should data-type="vertical" work?
[11:18:40] <arschmitz> yes
[11:18:42] <jasperdegroot> we never used that before since that was default
[11:18:47] <jasperdegroot> ok will check that
[11:18:55] <arschmitz> ok
[11:19:01] <jasperdegroot> I also saw some border issues in the button branch in UI: http://view.jqueryui.com/button/demos/controlgroup/default.html
[11:19:23] <arschmitz> ah yeah the booknow one is a little off
[11:19:42] <arschmitz> that should not effect mobile though since thats a css issue
[11:20:18] <jasperdegroot> do you want to keep those double borders between buttons?
[11:20:45] <jasperdegroot> yeah, but I thought it would be nice if Mobile and UI use same CSS as much as possible
[11:20:45] <arschmitz> yes other wise the hover states look weird
[11:21:01] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes for sure and we will fix it in ui of course
[11:21:14] <arschmitz> but the double border is intentional
[11:21:37] <jasperdegroot> will see how that works out in Mobile
[11:21:55] <arschmitz> ok
[11:22:40] <arschmitz> did you run into anything else?
[11:22:41] <jasperdegroot> will let you know when I run into more issues while finishing this
[11:22:46] <arschmitz> ok
[11:22:49] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:22:51] <jasperdegroot> yeah few other things
[11:23:00] <jasperdegroot> but maybe better to discuss on -dev
[11:23:16] <arschmitz> sure
[11:24:14] <arschmitz> ok i know sfrisk has been working on accordion but not sure there is anything to report yet?
[11:25:15] <arschmitz> we will go with no :)
[11:25:44] <sfrisk> nope, planning on next wee
[11:25:45] <sfrisk> k
[11:26:06] <arschmitz> nothing new still on pointer events wiaing on google
[11:26:23] <jasperdegroot> lawyers :/
[11:26:39] <arschmitz> css framework continues to crank along wont get into details here but check the repo
[11:26:49] <arschmitz> got our first pr on it today
[11:28:09] <arschmitz> so i think thats it unless anyone else has something
[11:28:40] <lisa_deluca> i wanted to share my npm module with everyone.  already shared it with Alex https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swSiPZqzfcQ
[11:29:18] <arschmitz> oh yeah thats cool stuff
[11:29:19] <jasperdegroot> cool
[11:29:23] <lisa_deluca> I was at the Defrag conference this week. and met a guy who created an app for connected cars joinfuse.com
[11:29:32] <lisa_deluca> anyways, he said he started using cordova so he didn't have to write an android app
[11:29:51] <lisa_deluca> and then added jQuery mobile.  and he said that he had some trouble getting started with how to add jQuery mobile to cordova.  a bit of a learning curve
[11:30:02] <lisa_deluca> so something like this npm module should be really helpful to get people going with cordova and jqm
[11:30:11] <arschmitz> for sure i think its a good idea
[11:30:22] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:30:29] <jasperdegroot> might want to tweet it arschmitz
[11:30:38] <jasperdegroot> from @jquerymobile
[11:30:41] <lisa_deluca> jasperdegroot: well, it's not live
[11:30:47] <lisa_deluca> only the youtube video, then it took it down
[11:30:48] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: its not a real thing yet
[11:30:56] <jasperdegroot> ahaaa
[11:30:57] <arschmitz> in the sense people cant get it
[11:31:02] <jasperdegroot> gotcha
[11:31:26] <lisa_deluca> It would definitely be easier approval wise (from IBM) if there was a way to host within jqm
[11:31:31] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: and I spoke about it
[11:31:46] <lisa_deluca> some incubation process would be nice just to get around the red tape
[11:31:47] <arschmitz> ill need to talk to kris scott and dave on that
[11:32:20] <arschmitz> but we will figure something out
[11:32:48] <arschmitz> they are all gone this week
[11:32:52] <lisa_deluca> anyways, just wanted to share :)
[11:32:53] <arschmitz> so ill talk to them next week
[11:33:04] <arschmitz> oh that does remind me though http://jsbin.com/xeqop/2
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> a proof of concept of multiple page contianers
[11:33:17] <jasperdegroot> yeah, saw that on -dev
[11:33:23] <jasperdegroot> nice!
[11:33:48] <arschmitz> back button does not work and you need to handle links your self
[11:33:52] <arschmitz> but it shows its possible
[11:35:00] <arschmitz> the slide transition even works in the first one
[11:35:26] <arschmitz> anyway anything else from anyone or the community?
[11:37:05] <sfrisk> Nope
[11:37:21] <jasperdegroot> not from me
[11:37:37] <arschmitz> ok thanks everyone see you all back on -dev!
[11:37:42] <jasperdegroot> later
