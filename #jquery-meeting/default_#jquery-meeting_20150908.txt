[10:03:00] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[10:03:17] <arthurvr> hey hey
[10:03:22] <geekman-rohit> hey
[10:03:27] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:06:19] <arschmitz> hi not really here for a few more minutes
[10:06:30] <kristyjy> hi
[10:06:52] <sfrisk> So I don't think we have too big of an update this week  - mostly because of holiday weekend stuff on my end and I didn't really see many updates on github
[10:07:11] <sfrisk> That being said, the Buttons Redux PR should be up later this week
[10:07:25] <geekman-rohit> and I broke the build on localize downloads somehow
[10:07:35] <geekman-rohit> Ill get it fixed today
[10:08:08] <geekman-rohit> Ill need some reviews and help on it, not all the projects downloaded via bower have a dist file
[10:08:09] <sfrisk> yeah, I have a PR I need to land tonight that fixes some jscs lint errors in task files
[10:08:22] <geekman-rohit> semicolons
[10:08:24] <sfrisk> Definitely, feel free to ping with help
[10:08:24] <geekman-rohit> :D
[10:08:32] <sfrisk> haha, yeah
[10:08:51] <sfrisk> I swore it didn't throw errors when I initially tested stuff when pulling in PRs
[10:09:02] <geekman-rohit> my new job is giving me less space to do open source :(
[10:09:08] <sfrisk> but then I put it on github, and bam, broken
[10:09:15] <sfrisk> Welcome to adult like, geekman-rohit!
[10:09:19] <sfrisk> life*
[10:09:27] <sfrisk> :-D
[10:09:40] <geekman-rohit> and sundays are like.. where is that sleep I need :/
[10:09:46] <sfrisk> Sleep is overrated
[10:09:56] <kristyjy> sleep is great don't lie lol
[10:09:58] <sfrisk> my issue the past few weeks has been an apartment that is 85 degrees and a broken AC
[10:11:10] <sfrisk> So localized downloads has a broken build issue, buttons pr will be updated shortly, probably once my AC gets fixed
[10:11:26] <sfrisk> Table styling is still open for someone to take over and finish - since there wasn't much left there
[10:13:30] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk / me whoever finishes buttons/meter first
[10:13:44] <sfrisk> that or kristyjy
[10:13:47] <sfrisk> she's good at CSS
[10:14:01] <sfrisk> But I think work is a bit crazy right now there
[10:14:04] <geekman-rohit> you forget where she works :/
[10:14:06] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[10:14:20] <kristyjy> yeah I might take that task but yeah like she said work has been nuts lol
[10:14:33] <sfrisk> if it's still free in three weeks, we'll talk to you
[10:14:48] <geekman-rohit> well work is crazy for me right now too
[10:14:49] <sfrisk> although if you have a chance on scss style guide, awesome - but like I said, I know you're doing some overtime lately
[10:14:54] <geekman-rohit> like CRAZY
[10:15:04] <sfrisk> well you just moved, started a job
[10:15:23] <kristyjy> works for me I'm planning to get some time to finish updating the style guide this week
[10:15:31] <sfrisk> awesome
[10:15:37] <kristyjy> so hopefully in a few weeks I'll be free from that :)
[10:15:44] <arthurvr> yay
[10:15:49] <arthurvr> :p
[10:16:13] <sfrisk> It would totally be fun to do a hack day sometime - although with all our time zones not sure how well that would work
[10:16:51] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[10:16:59] <kristyjy> yeah true it would probably have to be a weekend but I'd be up for it. Would have to be a few weeks once this work project is over :D
[10:17:31] <arthurvr> Ha, yeah.
[10:17:50] <geekman-rohit> nice idea
[10:18:07] <sfrisk> We could have it be for a full Saturday, witht he understanding people would 'be around' at various points of the day in chat
[10:18:31] <sfrisk> Might be fun for some team bonding and getting some issues done
[10:18:53] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[10:19:10] <geekman-rohit> saturday for you is like saturday night for me
[10:19:13] <arschmitz> id have to see when and what things were looking like
[10:19:15] <geekman-rohit> so works
[10:19:35] <arschmitz> my company is all out right now as we are doing inital public launch for company in like am onth
[10:19:45] <sfrisk> Fun times
[10:19:56] <geekman-rohit> we have a product release date to 1 october
[10:20:11] <geekman-rohit> i shouldave just joined a month later :/ meh
[10:20:13] <sfrisk> so maybe something early october?
[10:20:23] <sfrisk> after release dates
[10:20:34] <geekman-rohit> we could have like a hack weekend
[10:20:45] <geekman-rohit> free stickers for everyone to encourage them :D
[10:20:46] <sfrisk> that would be cool
[10:21:00] <sfrisk> I have a bunch of stickers I could mail people
[10:21:28] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[10:21:46] <arschmitz> yeah october things should settle down for me and ill be back to 25% OSS time
[10:21:54] <geekman-rohit> me too
[10:21:56] <kristyjy> hmmm neat idea maybe we could get more regular members if we encourage people to join our hack weekend for stickers
[10:22:22] <sfrisk> Definitely, we could make it into a monthly thing
[10:22:32] <sfrisk> help foster our community a bit
[10:22:49] <sfrisk> first Saturday in october is the 3rd
[10:23:31] <geekman-rohit> we could decide the date in next meeting
[10:23:50] <sfrisk> Definitely
[10:24:04] <sfrisk> but something to think about over the next week about what we could work on and would want to focus on
[10:24:23] <geekman-rohit> I think getting most PRs to merge should be a good start
[10:24:35] <sfrisk> Yeah
[10:25:21] <sfrisk> but should be fun
[10:25:42] <sfrisk> Okay so I have those two prs I need to pull in tonight, to fix the build and the [hidden] thing
[10:25:57] <sfrisk> I am going to create an issue for documentation to make sure we add a note about proper usage
[10:27:41] <geekman-rohit> and everyone look up probable schedules for october so we can decide on a weekend
[10:28:31] <sfrisk> Definitely
[10:29:04] <arthurvr> :+1:
[10:29:49] <sfrisk> Okay, so that's really most of my notes for this week, minus arthurvr I need to see if I can break my build on node 0.12
[10:30:06] <arthurvr> right
[10:30:08] <arthurvr> sgtm
[10:30:38] <sfrisk> So call it at 30, and we'll all work this week to try and get something in the PR for next meeting
[10:32:36] <sfrisk> okay, have a nice week everyone!
