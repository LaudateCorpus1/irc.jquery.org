[11:01:52] <johnbender> toddparker: are we doing a hangout
[11:01:54] <toddparker> hi all
[11:02:03] <johnbender> I have to hit the restroom quickly before we start
[11:02:16] <toddparker> TMI
[11:23:35] <toddparker> AMD is live
[11:24:30] <toddparker> working on a download builder now
[11:24:36] <toddparker> aiming for 1.1 for that
[11:24:47] <toddparker> live branch preview
[11:26:21] <toddparker> bender will look into fixing this, will work with eddie on this
[11:26:31] <toddparker> staging for mobile site
[11:26:58] <Wilto> Codename: “2 Live Preview.”
[11:31:08] <toddparker> new transitions: http://filamentgroup.com/tests/jqm-fade-out-in/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[11:40:23] <johnbender> toddparker: amazing
[11:40:36] <toddparker> things are looking smooth
[11:58:35] <toddparker> we're leaning towards using the new 3D transition support test to just use simple fade transitions on Android because it's smoother and less buggy than slide/pop
[11:58:56] <toddparker> 1.0.1 targeting within 10 days
[12:01:23] <toddparker> 1.1 - to include download builder, AMD, new transitions, fixed headers
[12:01:31] <toddparker> shooting for February for 1.1
[12:04:45] <toddparker> alright all, sighing off
[12:04:51] <toddparker> signing (sigh)
