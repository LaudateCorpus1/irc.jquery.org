[12:01:40] <fnagel> hey
[12:02:16] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> Give me one sec to get issue/PR counts.
[12:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> I think they finally went down.
[12:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, ticket count only went down by one.
[12:04:16] <arschmitz> and i just opened a pr
[12:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, fnagel any datepicker items to discuss?
[12:04:45] <fnagel> nope
[12:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> I finally landed the draggable focus handling change: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1548
[12:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I updated every build dependency.
[12:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1670
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> Well, all except grunt-html. I reverted that upgrade because it failed on Travis.
[12:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> But you can specify a JDK for Travis to use. Need to see if that works even for non-Java projects.
[12:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> And with these updates, we're now running tests on Phantom 2.
[12:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> Which enabled us to finally land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1536 which had been open for almost a year because Travis would fail the build.
[12:09:40] <arschmitz> yay
[12:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Got an estimate for when you'll have a chance to look at selectmenu icon position?
[12:11:20] <arschmitz> its done there is a pr
[12:11:36] <arschmitz> mention bot even pinged you :-)
[12:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it's the oldest unread email in my inbox.
[12:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> SO MUCH EMAIL
[12:12:17] <arschmitz> lol
[12:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll check that after the meeting.
[12:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom is going through the demos on the API site to make sure all of the demo frames are the right size after the theme update.
[12:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/241
[12:14:43] <arschmitz> thats good needed to be done
[12:14:47] <arschmitz> a lot changed
[12:14:51] <arschmitz> and a bunch of new demos
[12:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> That's everyone on the agenda. Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:18:28] <arschmitz> no
[12:18:40] <fnagel> n
[12:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
[13:01:06] <agcolom> Content meeting time :-)
[13:01:11] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone!
[13:01:29] <agcolom> Hi Aurelio :-)
[13:01:52] <agcolom> not sure whether Arthur is able to join this evening?
[13:02:09] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[13:02:15] <AurelioDeRosa> Is Karl here?
[13:02:24] <agcolom> Karl can't make it today
[13:02:45] <agcolom> So just some things that happened this week:
[13:02:52] <AurelioDeRosa> OK, so I think we can start
[13:02:55] <agcolom> UI produced api docs for 1.12.
[13:03:08] <agcolom> and I'm going through to check the example fit in their frames
[13:03:37] <AurelioDeRosa> Sounds good. Do you need help?
[13:03:39] <agcolom> this is ongoing. Shouldn't take long
[13:04:09] <agcolom> I've started and I should be finished this evening I hope :-)
[13:04:13] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[13:04:42] <AurelioDeRosa> Great!
[13:04:52] <agcolom> and as I was playing with SVG, I discovered a few issues with SVG and jQuery. We need to make it clear to users that jQuery doesnâ€™t support SVG even if some things will work.
[13:05:22] <agcolom> So Michal opened two issues:
[13:05:23] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/884
[13:05:25] <agcolom> and
[13:05:28] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/885
[13:07:12] <agcolom> (I assumed it would work since it's about dom manip)
[13:07:16] <AurelioDeRosa> I can take of these issues if you want
[13:07:27] <agcolom> that would be great! Thank you!
[13:07:31] <AurelioDeRosa> I can even try to submit a first PR for today
[13:07:37] <agcolom> wow!!!! :-)
[13:07:57] <agcolom> Then kswedberg and myself will comment when ready.
[13:08:06] <AurelioDeRosa> Sure.
[13:08:23] <agcolom> Wonderful.
[13:09:06] <agcolom> Also I wanted to say huge thanks for moving forward on the .editorconfig file issue
[13:09:50] <AurelioDeRosa> You're welcome. It wasn't the most precise PR in the world but it was to kickstart things
[13:10:12] <AurelioDeRosa> and to start discussing how we can fix that issue
[13:10:19] <agcolom> indeed!
[13:10:36] <agcolom> we discussed it last week, and the outcome was that it would be good to update hte PR to have all file types to use tab except for *.yml and package.json
[13:11:30] <AurelioDeRosa> I'll update the PR then
[13:12:03] <agcolom> thank you very much!!!!
[13:12:09] <AurelioDeRosa> Another thing I'd like to discuss is the GSoC
[13:12:17] <agcolom> oh yes
[13:12:28] <agcolom> good point I had forgotten about this.
[13:13:54] <agcolom> ok, so I saw you'd be happy to work with me on mentoring someone on the interactive tutorials project?
[13:14:21] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, that's correct. You mentioned the jQuery learning center but we also got another proposal from latt year
[13:14:38] <agcolom> yes
[13:14:54] <AurelioDeRosa> jQuery Content - Tracking of jQuery Issues on GitHub
[13:15:06] <agcolom> that one I have a student working on it
[13:15:44] <agcolom> did you prefer this one?
[13:16:21] <AurelioDeRosa> No, I only wanted to bring this idea up
[13:16:36] <AurelioDeRosa> We can have even more proposal because I remember that only few of them are actually accepter
[13:16:38] <AurelioDeRosa> accepted
[13:17:14] <agcolom> yes, that's correct, they'll tell us how many projects we can go for and then we need to make choices
[13:17:44] <AurelioDeRosa> OK, great. Then we can start with this one and see what happens
[13:18:25] <agcolom> the interactive tuts?
[13:20:07] <AurelioDeRosa> yes
[13:20:21] <agcolom> perfect.
[13:20:44] <agcolom> I think it's better to stick to one because each one is a lot of work responding to applicants
[13:22:04] <agcolom> So for that one I'd be happy to help on the pedagogic side, UX, etc. and it would be good if you could help with the technical aspects and technology choices? (and backend stuff if we need some)
[13:22:23] <AurelioDeRosa> Sure, definitely.
[13:22:39] <AurelioDeRosa> I actually even know a very talented developer that might be interested in this project.
[13:22:48] <agcolom> fantastic!
[13:22:57] <agcolom> is he/she a student?
[13:24:52] <AurelioDeRosa> He's a University student from the University of London.
[13:25:29] <agcolom> Perfect! That would be excellent!!!!
[13:26:18] <agcolom> Can you have a word with him?
[13:27:16] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, I can. Actually he works in my own company and I quickly mentioned to him this project. He was interested but I didn't go into the details
[13:27:17] <agcolom> that would be awesome because we could even meet him face to face. It would be really good!
[13:27:31] <AurelioDeRosa> But if you think that he might be a good fit, I can actually talk more seriously with him
[13:27:39] <agcolom> Excellent!
[13:27:49] <agcolom> SO that was all I had for today...
[13:28:29] <AurelioDeRosa> OK. Thank you very much for the agenda
[13:28:33] <AurelioDeRosa> and for all your work
[13:28:39] <AurelioDeRosa> See you in two weeks
[13:29:02] <agcolom> see you in 2 weeks :-)
[13:29:18] <agcolom> thanks very much for all the hard work :-)
