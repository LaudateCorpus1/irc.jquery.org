[08:59:41] <rworth> hey
[09:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[09:00:36] <kborchers> hi
[09:00:40] <gnarf> howdy
[09:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's get started.
[09:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Anything that needs to be discussed about infrastructure?
[09:02:05] <danheberden> not particular to ui - we have a plan moving forward to allocate time for it
[09:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.17 was finally announced yesterday.
[09:02:48] <gnarf> im here but semi afk - be sure to use my name if you need my opinion, trying to tackle issues on api.jquery.com
[09:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> Paul updated the Google CDN :-)
[09:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> We do have some issues though.
[09:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> The minified concatenated i18n file is completely busted.
[09:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> It just contains the word "undefined"; there's no actual content.
[09:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> This is the cause of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8004
[09:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8005
[09:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf, jzaefferer: We'll need to figure out what's broken in the build script.
[09:04:32] <jzaefferer> clarkbox made some progress on TestSwarm/BrowserStack integration, but nothing to see there yet, as far as I know
[09:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what we can do about the CDNs though.
[09:04:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what is broken? :)
[09:04:55] <gnarf> aha
[09:04:57] <gnarf> just read that
[09:05:14] <gnarf> I'll dig into it soon
[09:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> We might need to just push 1.8.18 once we fix the build script.
[09:05:26] <gnarf> I really think we should try to replace that ant build chain with make
[09:05:43] <gnarf> because I'm having some strange issues with it anyway
[09:05:49] <gnarf> that i can only repro on mac os
[09:05:54] <gnarf> never happens on my linux vm
[09:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That's a possibility, but we'll need to be careful with testing.
[09:06:07] <jzaefferer> or convert to a node script?
[09:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> Either one is fine with me.
[09:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to have a meeting to discuss this, plus some other issues, and our plans going forward.
[09:06:33] <jzaefferer> I don't care about ant anymore, but at least I'm more familiar with that then make
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like jzaefferer, rworth, and gnarf to be there at a minimum
[09:06:53] <rworth> core seems to have a decent model
[09:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> probably kborchers too
[09:07:04] <rworth> do simple stuff in make, have it call out some complex stuff to node
[09:07:11] <jzaefferer> well, don't need all of em for the build script
[09:07:26] <jzaefferer> rworth: that sounds good, too
[09:07:37] <jzaefferer> but please no sed stuff in make ;)
[09:07:39] <gnarf> make is really strong for dealing with file lists, etc
[09:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, rworth, gnarf, kborchers: what's your availability today?
[09:08:18] <rworth> anytime until 5pm
[09:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be really good if we could have ~30 minute Skype call
[09:08:29] <jzaefferer> I'll take the time
[09:08:55] <gnarf> before 2 or 3 hours from now is best
[09:08:59] <jzaefferer> sooner the better
[09:09:04] <kborchers> i could prob jump on without cam and mic and contribute via chat here at the office. i'm out after 3:30 CST
[09:09:35] <gnarf> i was planning on heading into the new "job" at 1pm my time ( +2 hrs from now )
[09:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok, well our agenda doesn't have much more on it, so maybe we can finish up and just do it now
[09:09:41] <gnarf> but i can delay for a meeting
[09:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: does now work for you or are you buried in api.jquery.com?
[09:10:20] <gnarf> kinda buried trying to fix these issues
[09:10:31] <gnarf> maybe 20 min?
[09:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. Let's go through the rest of the agenda.
[09:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers, jzaefferer: selectmenu update?
[09:11:11] <jzaefferer> got nothing on selectmenu
[09:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> select-first-item was fixed last week, right?
[09:11:23] <kborchers> yes
[09:12:05] <jzaefferer> I'll ping Felix to get an idea
[09:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> What's the status on the code review for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/492 ?
[09:12:07] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by fnagel (3m, 1d ago): Selectmenu: Code review
[09:12:25] <jzaefferer> probably still working on units
[09:12:32] <jzaefferer> Dan Wellman got involved in that as well
[09:12:53] <jzaefferer> could that land in 1.9?
[09:12:56] <jzaefferer> or is that a no-go?
[09:13:42] <gnarf> it'd be nice if it could
[09:14:13] <kborchers> i agree, it would make sense for that to come along with Menu i think
[09:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It's possible. Let's keep it in a separate branch for now, but keep that up to date with master
[09:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's honestly a bit awkward to bring in another form element widget at this point, but I'm ok with that.
[09:15:04] <jzaefferer> pinged Felix, he should be here soon
[09:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to get more moaning about inconsistent theming of forms
[09:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm sure that will be drowned out by the improvements in 1.9 and the benefit of having the widget vs. not having it
[09:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> Does that sounds like a plan?
[09:17:33] <jzaefferer> I'm sure Filament Group will also appreciate it
[09:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> Keep it in the selectmenu branch for now, and we'll try to get it into master for 1.9
[09:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> But not right now.
[09:17:56] <kborchers> +1
[09:17:56] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:19:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get in touch with clarkbox about TestSwarm clients.
[09:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea where we actually stand with that.
[09:19:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you send an email introducing us (I don't think we've ever talked) and asking for an update on his progress?
[09:21:10] <jzaefferer> I'm mostly chatting with him here on irc via PMs every once in a while
[09:21:24] <jzaefferer> I'll aks him to send his next update to #jqueryui-dev
[09:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:27:28] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything.
[09:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ready for the call?
[09:32:53] <gnarf> soon
[09:33:13] <gnarf> yeah, call
[09:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, rworth: is there a grid meeting today?
[09:33:37] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: nope
[09:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:33:56] <rworth> we should unschedule those for the time being, likely until 1.9 is out
[09:33:57] <afshin> when will the next grid meeting be?
[09:34:00] <afshin> oh i see
[09:34:16] <rworth> we really can't focus on anything before 1.9 at this point
