[14:02:05] <geekman-rohit> @arschmits, @kristyjy, @nashvail
[14:02:11] <geekman-rohit> hey everyone
[14:02:29] <geekman-rohit> @arschmitz :/
[14:02:38] <arschmitz> hi
[14:02:38] <nashvail> hey!
[14:02:53] <geekman-rohit> so sarah may not be around much today during meeting
[14:03:05] <geekman-rohit> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit
[14:03:09] <geekman-rohit> the agenda
[14:04:20] <geekman-rohit> #arschmitz there seems to be some problem with nashvail's CLA
[14:04:40] <geekman-rohit> he claims to have signed it multiple times, maybe the status isnt getting updated
[14:04:44] <geekman-rohit> that has happend before
[14:04:54] <geekman-rohit> @arschmitz, damn I am bad at typing
[14:05:00] <arschmitz> looking
[14:05:52] <arschmitz> if you follow the link on the PR it tells you the problem
[14:05:53] <arschmitz> http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/status/?owner=jquery&repo=css-chassis&sha=397073611981418a6c75558528e07f32be792828
[14:06:49] <nashvail> I did the following I signed with  nashvail, nishantve1@gmail.com that didn't work, then I changed git global user.name to Nash Vail and signed with Nash Vail (nishantve1@gmail.com)
[14:06:53] <nashvail> even that didn't fix the issue
[14:07:08] <arschmitz> you should follow the instructions on the cla
[14:07:12] <arschmitz> and sign it with your real name
[14:07:19] <arschmitz> and make sure you git config matches
[14:07:53] <geekman-rohit> @nashvail
[14:07:57] <arschmitz> your sig is Nishant Verma, Nash Vail
[14:08:03] <geekman-rohit> that would be Nishant Verma I guess
[14:08:12] <arschmitz> and the git config is
[14:08:29] <arschmitz> nashvail
[14:08:55] <arschmitz> there is a link on every pr in the status that says click here for details and tells you why it failed
[14:08:56] <nashvail> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/zmrmvBuH/Screen%20Shot%202016-06-07%20at%2011.38.32%20PM.png
[14:09:11] <arschmitz> thats not whats in your pr
[14:09:44] <arschmitz> and its also not what you signed with
[14:09:48] <geekman-rohit> @nashvail you can ammend the commits
[14:09:57] <nashvail> I have just pushed a commit to this PR https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/166 with that git config, is there a step I am missing?
[14:09:59] <geekman-rohit> i think the CLA page shows how to do that
[14:10:24] <arschmitz> nashvail: and notice it passes now that things match
[14:10:31] <geekman-rohit> yes
[14:10:34] <geekman-rohit> it does
[14:10:48] <nashvail> oh yes it does
[14:10:48] <geekman-rohit> you can do that with all your PRs, I think you intended to squash ur commits anyways
[14:10:54] <nashvail> I did squash the commits
[14:11:01] <geekman-rohit> @arshmitz should we insist the name be real
[14:11:21] <geekman-rohit> in that case Nash Vail, in git config is not @nashvail's real name
[14:11:26] <arschmitz> so it "should" be but there is nothing that stops people from using a not real name
[14:11:33] <arschmitz> we only know because we know nashvail
[14:12:07] <arschmitz> so it would be appreciated but its not the end of the world
[14:12:25] <nashvail> as long as the CLA works I am fine I guess
[14:12:37] <geekman-rohit> He is just happy it finally worked
[14:12:37] <nashvail> So I will have to rebase the commits
[14:12:53] <nashvail> Yes I am been banging my head on this since last week
[14:13:14] <geekman-rohit> so nashvails PR https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/166/files
[14:13:19] <geekman-rohit> nashvail that is much better
[14:13:31] <geekman-rohit> that at-root thingy u did before was super weird
[14:13:52] <arschmitz> nashvail: it really should be your real name thats what we ask for but i wont make a stink over it
[14:14:51] <nashvail> I was just confused how to figure if the parent is an anchor tag but underline was disabled by default which I didn't notice until Sarah Pointed.
[14:15:10] <nashvail> yes Alex, I will switch the name as long as the CLA doesn't break again
[14:15:12] <nashvail> for me
[14:15:37] <arschmitz> nashvail: it wasnt broken you just signed it incorrectly :-)
[14:15:57] <nashvail> yeah got it
[14:18:12] <geekman-rohit> nashvail if you can fix CLA on all ur PRs
[14:18:30] <nashvail> yes I will
[14:18:39] <geekman-rohit> we can merge them into branches for people to see on view.css-chassis.com
[14:19:35] <nashvail> okay first thing I will fix my signing issue before anything on all the PRs, it will be ok right if I squashed them all to the latest commit ?
[14:19:51] <nashvail> on that branch
[14:20:13] <geekman-rohit> yes
[14:20:30] <nashvail> alright cool
[14:20:43] <nashvail> Also it would be great if I got some feedbacks on the actual code
[14:21:23] <nashvail> Travis complains about color, date and other such inputs of not being supported by all browsers, should I get rid of those from the html file?
[14:21:41] <geekman-rohit> I'll ping people up on the PR for reviews if they dont comment by this thursday
[14:21:48] <geekman-rohit> you can do the same if I dont comment
[14:22:07] <nashvail> alright
[14:22:12] <geekman-rohit> what are these all browsers?
[14:22:31] <geekman-rohit> if they are one of the browsers we plan to support, we should find a way to fix it
[14:23:15] <nashvail> the message is something like consider using polyfills
[14:23:21] <nashvail> I am sending a link one sec
[14:24:59] <nashvail> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/css-chassis/builds/135785278
[14:25:53] <geekman-rohit> remove them
[14:25:54] <geekman-rohit> :)
[14:25:57] <geekman-rohit> as simple as that
[14:26:37] <nashvail> yeah that's what I was asking for
[14:27:52] <geekman-rohit> Ill review your PRs after work tomorrow
[14:27:55] <geekman-rohit> and ask others as wel
[14:28:02] <geekman-rohit> feel free to ping me if I dont
[14:28:18] <nashvail> sure! evening sounds good ?

[14:28:36] <nashvail> ah ok got it.
[14:28:54] <geekman-rohit> Id probably be on way to home from work at 6
[14:29:04] <geekman-rohit> we can call it a day ? since no one is around mostly
[14:30:26] <nashvail> üëç  I was wondering if kristyjy had something to share for the tables part
[14:30:38] <geekman-rohit> she isnt around
[14:30:56] <geekman-rohit> she and sarah work together, I guess its a busy day for then
[14:30:57] <geekman-rohit> them
[14:31:11] <nashvail> alright. My conerns are addressed.
[14:31:18] <nashvail> so if no one is around we can call it a day
[14:32:36] <geekman-rohit> here she is
[14:32:41] <geekman-rohit> hey kristyjy
[14:32:50] <kristy> sorry I'm late.. meetings and things are annoying ;)
[14:32:51] <geekman-rohit> updates on full width table?
[14:33:01] <geekman-rohit> I heard things were thrown at you
[14:33:03] <kristy> I'm a terrible person lol
[14:33:04] <geekman-rohit> to get you here
[14:33:33] <kristy> I'll work on it tonight.. you can sorta blame Sarah I was planning on working on it last night ;)
[14:33:55] <geekman-rohit> lol
[14:34:31] <kristy> but I helped move boxes instead of code lol
[14:34:47] <geekman-rohit> aha
[14:35:05] <geekman-rohit> so you are helping her
[14:35:21] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy would be good if you find time to review PRs by nashvail

[14:35:36] <kristy> okay I'll take a look at those tonight too
[14:35:58] <nashvail> thanks kristy!
[14:36:56] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy, another thing
[14:37:16] <geekman-rohit> you will need to fix your commit to get a valid CLA label it seems
[14:37:22] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/158
[14:37:36] <kristy> yes! I need to do some rebasing as I used my work email by mistake
[14:37:47] <kristy> that and adding the fullwidth table support are my goals
[14:38:06] <geekman-rohit> sounds goo
[14:38:09] <geekman-rohit> good*
[14:38:16] * geekman-rohit hates this desk
[14:39:01] <geekman-rohit> if that is all, we can ask sarah to mute the chat
[14:40:12] <geekman-rohit> all right then, have a great week people, and see if you can sign the attending thingy in  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit
[14:40:26] <geekman-rohit> Adieu!
