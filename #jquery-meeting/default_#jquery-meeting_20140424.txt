[11:02:03] <agcolom> Good evening :-)
[11:02:06] <gseguin> here
[11:02:10] <arschmitz> hi
[11:02:14] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:02:25] <uGoMobi> welcome back agcolom
[11:02:31] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[11:02:40] <agcolom> such short vacation!!!!
[11:02:46] <cgack> hey
[11:03:22] <agcolom> Can I ask a v quick question to everyone for the talk I'm writing for jQuery Oxford?
[11:03:44] * gseguin is grabbing lunch and will be back shortly
[11:03:48] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[11:04:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: maybe better to ask the question on -dev
[11:04:13] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sure
[11:04:31] <agcolom> will do after the meeting
[11:05:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sure or you can do it now... we can multitask :)
[11:05:33] <agcolom> ok
[11:05:51] <uGoMobi> any topics for this week?
[11:06:55] <_|Nix|_> I dunno ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6810 ... *shrug* ... not really, but still ... kinda bothers me.
[11:07:11] <_|Nix|_> This bug that only happens on Android 4.4.
[11:07:37] <_|Nix|_> I closed it, meaning I can probably also close the related PRs without merging, but I can't help but think that it may be relevant still.
[11:07:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we haven't been able to reproduce, right?
[11:07:42] <_|Nix|_> No.
[11:07:50] <_|Nix|_> What's the market share for 4.4?
[11:07:56] <_|Nix|_> ... and I don't mean 4.4.2
[11:08:02] <_|Nix|_> Just exactly 4.4.
[11:09:24] <_|Nix|_> Doing great on merging PRs!
[11:09:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: those are essentially auto updates security patches
[11:09:35] <cgack> probably small %, there was a really fast patch for "issues" to 4.4.1 when I got my nexus 5
[11:09:38] <arschmitz> so i would say it would be very low that are not on 4.4.2
[11:09:41] <uGoMobi> http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html?utm_source=ausdroid.net
[11:09:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, so chances are that bug is gone forever.
[11:09:48] <uGoMobi> but that's app store
[11:09:59] <uGoMobi> so not browser market share
[11:10:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I dunno if I can give any examples for your comment in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6574
[11:10:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that does not break down 4.4.0 vs 4.4.2 that i see?
[11:10:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just figured, if the fields of the location object are not always reliable, as we've now seemingly had a precedent, then we should use only one field: location.href.
[11:10:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what precendent?
[11:10:57] <uGoMobi> ah, _|Nix|_ meant 4.4.0 ?
[11:11:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That the location object /was/ broken on Android 4.4.0
[11:11:10] <uGoMobi> I wouldn't worry about too much
[11:11:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it there was an issue with that tit should be VERY obvious and is a huge issue with a browser
[11:11:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: A WebView, in this case.
[11:11:34] <arschmitz> that would mean in some cases the same url put in two different browsers would take you two different places
[11:11:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, no, because location.href was still correct.
[11:11:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It was just broken down differently.
[11:12:10] <_|Nix|_> location.path was /server.com/path/to/
[11:12:19] <_|Nix|_> ... and location.host was empty.
[11:12:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you ever actually see this ?
[11:12:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and we're using location.host directly to assemble the URL in getLocation()
[11:13:14] <_|Nix|_> No, no ... of course not. That's why I closed the issue, but I doubt it was a complete figment.
[11:13:26] <uGoMobi> I tested on Nexus 5 Android 4.4.2 in Webview app and couldn't reproduce
[11:13:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that was the exact device mentioned in the report, eh?
[11:13:56] <arschmitz> im hesitant to implement something to reproduce something already in the browser when we cant find a single situation which its wrong
[11:14:00] <arschmitz> thats just crazy
[11:14:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's fair.
[11:14:59] <arschmitz> we should use exactly what the browser gives us directly until we find a case where this causes an issue
[11:15:05] <arschmitz> and we can then worry about workaround
[11:15:16] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:15:36] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:15:49] <_|Nix|_> I'll re-work that part of the PR for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6574
[11:17:00] <_|Nix|_> So, that's about all I can think of.
[11:17:17] <_|Nix|_> BTW: I fixed the build.
[11:17:24] <uGoMobi> nice!
[11:17:35] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. It's in a PR.
[11:17:40] <arschmitz> there has been surprisingly little reaction to the page events change announcement
[11:17:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope that doesn't mean everyone's ditching jQM :/
[11:18:10] * gseguin is back
[11:18:48] <uGoMobi> when shall we do a 1.4.3 release
[11:18:49] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:19:03] <arschmitz> i think as soon as the page event stuff is all ready
[11:19:15] <arschmitz> what ever we have then do a 1.4.3 with
[11:19:24] <uGoMobi> sounds good to me
[11:20:10] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:20:15] <arschmitz> so randomly met someone that just made thir first app for a company that works with microsoft dynamics ax to build custom software and they are starting to use jqm for their mobile apps
[11:20:28] <arschmitz> so thats kinda cool news
[11:20:39] <gseguin> nice
[11:20:40] <uGoMobi> heh cool
[11:20:42] <_|Nix|_> I love running into jQM in the wild :)
[11:21:00] <arschmitz> they really liked their first app using it too they are really ahppy with 1.4
[11:21:05] <_|Nix|_> I booked my annual safety inspection for my car via jQM 1.veryLittle
[11:21:12] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:21:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: and the api docs were one of their favorite parts :)
[11:21:26] <_|Nix|_> Very, very cool!
[11:21:35] <_|Nix|_> Good vibes, all around!
[11:21:49] <_|Nix|_> Sets my existential worries at ease :)
[11:22:04] <uGoMobi> maybe it's good to talk a bit more about development for 1.5 next week
[11:22:14] <uGoMobi> who is working or going to work on what
[11:22:36] <_|Nix|_> Not a bad idea, but I also have a bit of sleuthing on my plate for core.
[11:22:37] <uGoMobi> there will be a meeting with the web-ui-fw team again tomorrow
[11:24:28] <uGoMobi> any updates on the topics from last weeks? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc#gid=25
[11:25:03] <cgack> i don't think i know what the web-ui-fw team is
[11:25:33] <uGoMobi> cgack: I think _|Nix|_ is the right person to explain
[11:25:55] <_|Nix|_> cgack: It's a team from a company called S-Core (wholly owned by Samsung) working on extra widgets based on jQuery Mobile.
[11:26:21] <cgack> cool
[11:26:30] <_|Nix|_> cgack: I started web-ui-fw with some colleagues from Intel for Tizen, and then Samsung got in on the act.
[11:26:34] <uGoMobi> they are in South Korea
[11:27:34] <gseguin> uGoMobi: css builder is decoupled
[11:28:09] <_|Nix|_> cgack: http://web-ui-fw.github.io/jqm/0.2.0/demos/
[11:28:10] <gseguin> and published to NPM so the ball is now in rxaviers' hands
[11:28:23] <uGoMobi> gseguin: that's great!
[11:30:28] <_|Nix|_> cgack: There are also some older widgets: http://web-ui-fw.github.io/ - some stuff from there has already made its way into jQM.
[11:31:32] <uGoMobi> A market researcher from DZone contacted me for a survey. First the review the survey and now to fill out the form.
[11:31:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there are a few things I want your help with, have time tomorrow?
[11:32:04] <arschmitz> sure
[11:32:09] <uGoMobi> few things as in few questions
[11:32:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah ill be here
[11:32:29] <uGoMobi> ok great, will ping you
[11:32:51] <uGoMobi> I think we can keep it short today
[11:33:09] <agcolom> got to get my son from rock climbing...
[11:33:19] <_|Nix|_> I'm psyched about the progress towards 1.4.3.
[11:33:20] <uGoMobi> unless there is anything else you want to discuss we can wrap up and go back to -dev
[11:33:38] <uGoMobi> ok agcolom, see you later
[11:33:39] <_|Nix|_> I'm good.
[11:34:26] <gseguin> I'm good
