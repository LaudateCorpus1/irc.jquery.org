[08:57:17] <rwaldron> oh hai
[09:00:24] <darcyclarke> rwaldron oh hai!
[09:01:03] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:01:09] <jaubourg> hullo
[09:01:26] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg, still got that girlfriend?
[09:01:37] <jaubourg> yes
[09:01:42] <DaveMethvin> damn! :D
[09:01:48] <jaubourg> she's playing kung fu panda 2 on the kinect as we speak
[09:02:11] <DaveMethvin> we won't share you!
[09:02:23] <jaubourg> lol
[09:02:31] <DaveMethvin> who else is here?
[09:02:49] <sindresorhus> here :)
[09:02:51] <jaubourg> just bought a couple hdmi cables and she's looking at her gigantic tv as if she had never saw it before :P
[09:03:00] <DaveMethvin> hey sindresorhus
[09:03:15] <jaubourg> hey sindresorhus, nice to meet you "in person"
[09:03:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah and thanks for all your help sindresorhus
[09:03:31] <sindresorhus> jaubourg:  Yeah, dude, you too ;)
[09:03:45] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin: Sure
[09:03:57] <DaveMethvin> well this meeting may represent one of our issues recently ... we need more activity!
[09:04:16] <jaubourg> def
[09:04:25] <DaveMethvin> i think the bug triage is still okay, we just need to get things going on 1.8 for example
[09:04:36] <jaubourg> hey gibson
[09:04:37] <ronchi> :sh
[09:04:38] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:04:45] <gibson042> hi all
[09:04:56] <DaveMethvin> the bug tracker is really starting to piss me off
[09:05:11] <DaveMethvin> i had a nice reply all written and it stack-traced all over it
[09:05:36] <DaveMethvin> ok now the party is starting ... hey louisremi
[09:05:38] <jaubourg> yeah, the bug tracker soft is dumb as f-ck these days
[09:05:44] <jaubourg> hey louisremi
[09:05:46] <DaveMethvin> we'll give folks a sec to show up
[09:05:56] <louisremi> Hey guys :-)
[09:06:52] <DaveMethvin> ok, so on 1.7.2 i think we are in pretty good shape
[09:07:06] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg is going to nail that callbacks bug
[09:07:16] <DaveMethvin> i have one or two events bugs to be fixed if possible
[09:07:24] <jaubourg> k
[09:07:35] <DaveMethvin> one involves adding some more hooks to special events ... not sure if i want to do that in 1.7.2 or wait for 1.8
[09:07:46] <DaveMethvin> but if I don't *document* them .... :)
[09:08:07] <jaubourg> you know how this kind of stuff ends when we put it in minor releases :P
[09:08:28] <DaveMethvin> so i still don't have a strong feeling on when 1.7.2 should ship but thought it was a good idea to create a beta that might encourage external testing
[09:08:44] <DaveMethvin> when the time seems right we can do an rc
[09:09:14] <rwaldron> jaubourg <3
[09:09:15] <rwaldron> hey dude
[09:09:18] <DaveMethvin> there is still quite a bit of activity on twitter from ppl upgrading from 1.4.x to 1.7.x
[09:09:19] <jaubourg> hey rick
[09:09:22] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[09:09:33] <rwaldron> thanks for filling in the blanks on that PR
[09:09:35] <rwaldron> hey DaveMethvin
[09:09:37] <jaubourg> np
[09:09:38] <rwaldron> :)
[09:10:00] <DaveMethvin> soooo... with 1.7.2 under control we need to get some stuff going on 1.8
[09:10:26] <DaveMethvin> i have the link there, assuming the tracker dosnt' replace it with a stack dump
[09:10:56] <DaveMethvin> we still have some unassigned things but mainly i am wondering about the big ticket items
[09:11:30] <jaubourg> how so ?
[09:11:35] <rwaldron> ugh
[09:11:38] <DaveMethvin> timmywil has a sizzle rewrite and gnarf an effects rewrite
[09:11:39] <rwaldron> stack dump
[09:12:09] <DaveMethvin> then we have a refactor to reduce dependencies
[09:12:23] <DaveMethvin> only slightly related to Closure Compiler really
[09:12:42] <rwaldron> I'm working on a complete build tool reorganization, that will exist in parallel with the current system until in parity
[09:12:47] <DaveMethvin> the goal being an ability to leave out effects or ajax or sizzle
[09:12:51] <rwaldron> to simplify the process
[09:13:02] <DaveMethvin> in a custom build
[09:13:03] <rwaldron> i hate that list of files in the Makefile
[09:13:22] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: what would you replace it with?
[09:13:32] <DaveMethvin> we could annotate dependencies in the files themselves
[09:13:39] <DaveMethvin> i think that's what mobile did
[09:13:39] <rwaldron> node based system that we developed at Bocoup
[09:13:46] <rwaldron> fully tested on windoze
[09:13:46] <DaveMethvin> oh
[09:13:51] <DaveMethvin> sweeeeeeet
[09:13:57] <DaveMethvin> is that the grunt stuff?
[09:14:02] <rwaldron> yessir
[09:14:10] <DaveMethvin> been meaning to look at taht
[09:14:18] <rwaldron> it's almost... too easy
[09:14:21] <DaveMethvin> well i am all up for it
[09:14:28] <sindresorhus> grunt is awesome, used it for a personal project recently.
[09:14:31] <rwaldron> excellent
[09:14:36] <rwaldron> sindresorhus nice!
[09:14:42] <DaveMethvin> anything that makes our build process easier
[09:15:05] <timmywil> here sry
[09:15:06] <rwaldron> So, #10589 is anyone chomping at the bit to have this?
[09:15:17] <DaveMethvin> ?10589
[09:15:19] <bot-t1> [#10589]  (open enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/10589
[09:15:19] <rwaldron> sorry... docs#10589
[09:15:20] <bot-t1> [#10589]  (open enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/10589
[09:15:23] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10589
[09:15:24] <rwaldron> ugh
[09:15:46] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean the STACK TRACE rwaldron? :(
[09:16:03] <DaveMethvin> what a pain
[09:16:19] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that's the one
[09:16:26] <rwaldron> Deprecate $.fn.data("events") - Replace with debugging extension
[09:16:51] <DaveMethvin> the deprecation is done for 1.8 right?
[09:16:57] <DaveMethvin> if so we can't remove until 1.9
[09:17:06] <DaveMethvin> or was that on the 1.7 list?
[09:17:08] <rwaldron> Ohhh right
[09:17:12] <rwaldron> ok, thanks for the reminder
[09:17:36] <DaveMethvin> well anyway it's pretty easy
[09:17:48] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we're committing ourselves to making a debug plugin
[09:18:03] <rwaldron> ok, well it's in the list
[09:18:14] <rwaldron> maybe I misunderstood the list's purpose
[09:18:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah there are  a few in there like that
[09:18:45] <DaveMethvin> proposals where the action for 1.8 may only be to deprecate or such
[09:18:51] <DaveMethvin> which is just a docs issue
[09:19:14] <DaveMethvin> like removing ajax async
[09:19:51] <DaveMethvin> whoops i mean sync ... making deferreds always async depends on removing ajax sync
[09:20:06] <jaubourg> yep
[09:20:29] <DaveMethvin> so basically all we can do for 1.8 is tell people we aren't going to support it in the future
[09:20:40] <DaveMethvin> and i am fine with that
[09:21:36] <DaveMethvin> a few things snuck on here that didn't get voted
[09:21:44] <DaveMethvin> let
[09:21:53] <DaveMethvin> let's try to clear them off now
[09:22:08] <DaveMethvin> integrate widget factory? I don't think we will
[09:22:18] <DaveMethvin> docs #10442
[09:22:19] <bot-t1> [#10442] Integrate widget factory (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/10442
[09:22:38] <rwaldron> I'd love to, but given our larger-picture goals, no
[09:23:10] <mikesherov> late
[09:23:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think there are some pros, but perhaps in the jQuery UI 2.0 / jQuery 2.0 time frame it's better
[09:23:26] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[09:23:37] <mikesherov> I'm getting better, going from noshow to late
[09:23:38] <DaveMethvin> so atm we're looking at the 1.8 tickets
[09:23:40] <mikesherov> :-P
[09:23:46] <mikesherov> OK
[09:24:37] <DaveMethvin> on the adding of Google Chrome ... perhaps we can branch off that code into a jquery-browser plugin and support/fix it there?
[09:24:50] <DaveMethvin> with the idea that we've frozen/deprecated what is in core
[09:24:55] <DaveMethvin> carrot and stick
[09:25:09] <mikesherov> lets beat them with the stick
[09:25:20] <DaveMethvin> hell i'll beat them with the carrot
[09:25:57] <DaveMethvin> so in 1.8 there would be a plugin for that but we'd keep the existing code as is ... most likely remove in 1.9
[09:26:03] <mikesherov> so, my only c omment on that is that our unit tests still use $.browser a few times
[09:26:04] <louisremi> I did that two weeks ago: https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.browser
[09:26:34] <DaveMethvin> sweet louisremi, are you planning to maintain that?
[09:27:18] <louisremi> Yep, or throw it altogether if someone else in the team wants to make his own
[09:28:10] <DaveMethvin> ok i'mma mark this as going into a plugin, again won't be removed in 1.8 but let's target 1.9
[09:28:24] <DaveMethvin> and the plugin will substitute
[09:30:31] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sorry, i was afk for a moment
[09:30:39] <rwaldron> but yes, that's how I have browser/chrome set up
[09:30:44] <DaveMethvin> timmywil  you have a lot of stuff for 1.8, how does your time look?
[09:30:44] <rwaldron> are we removing?
[09:30:52] <rwaldron> with accompanying plugin?
[09:31:03] <DaveMethvin> in 1.9 removed to a plugin
[09:31:19] <DaveMethvin> but in 1.8 the plugin should be avail with whatever fixes are required
[09:31:34] <rwaldron> louisremi I have the whole thing (including its tests) moved
[09:31:35] <DaveMethvin> so someone could start using the plugin as of 1.8
[09:31:49] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sounds good
[09:32:03] <louisremi> rwaldron: moved where?
[09:32:11] <rwaldron> I have a local branch
[09:32:19] <rwaldron> I've been working on those tickets
[09:32:34] <louisremi> rwaldron: alright
[09:33:07] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sizzle will be my focus
[09:33:11] <DaveMethvin> ugh, this is getting frustrating ... how about we do this in email after I get someone to look at trac?
[09:33:45] <DaveMethvin> i can't edit tickets reliably
[09:34:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: maybe you'd like to pick up docs#10814
[09:34:04] <bot-t1> DaveMethvin, #10814 (make support as lazy as possible with closure in mind ... - Opened 2 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10814
[09:34:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah just looking at that one
[09:34:13] <DaveMethvin> i can take it
[09:34:34] <DaveMethvin> or i will try now ... :D
[09:34:46] <DaveMethvin> nope, stack trace
[09:34:55] <mikesherov> 10814
[09:34:56] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that's fine
[09:35:00] <mikesherov> about 10814
[09:35:01] <rwaldron> we're in no hurry, remember?
[09:35:23] <mikesherov> I really think we need to implement the simplify offset ticket first
[09:35:41] <mikesherov> it makes $.support a lot smaller
[09:35:49] <DaveMethvin> i like that idea mikesherov
[09:35:56] <DaveMethvin> we'll simplify it first
[09:36:00] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/642
[09:36:01] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1m, 6d ago): fixes #10996 (simplify offset)
[09:36:15] <mikesherov> I'm just waiting for the mobile team to confirm it's safe
[09:36:26] <DaveMethvin> i think we are going to break some rules about deprecation/removal regarding $.support
[09:36:40] <DaveMethvin> but the lesson learned is  "don't document $.support"
[09:36:49] <mikesherov> $.support is an asshole
[09:36:53] <DaveMethvin> damn right
[09:36:58] <mikesherov> write your own support tests!
[09:37:04] <DaveMethvin> or use modernizr
[09:37:12] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin acn you go ahead and create an empty repo on github.com/jquery called "jquery-browser"
[09:37:16] <mikesherov> or use ANYTHING other than $.support
[09:37:25] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: sure
[09:37:33] <rwaldron> thank you sir
[09:38:18] <timmywil> mikesherov, DaveMethvin: are we sure removing the manual offset calcs won't affect mobile?
[09:38:40] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov was waiting to hear from the mobile team
[09:38:56] <mikesherov> timmywil: the webkit fallback covers safari 4
[09:39:19] <timmywil> mikesherov: they have a lot more to support than safari 4. we should be careful about removing fallbacks
[09:39:42] <mikesherov> so, we are definitely going to lose some browsers that are not webkit (as of safari 4) and don't have the bounding rectangle stuff
[09:39:45] <mikesherov> but yeah
[09:39:50] <mikesherov> that's why I reached out to them
[09:39:56] <sindresorhus> Do we support Safari 4? http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility
[09:40:08] <mikesherov> and it's why I complain about us saying we only support certain browsers when that isn't true
[09:40:19] <mikesherov> sindresorhus: exactly
[09:40:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's a bit strange, that list is mainly desktop
[09:40:33] <mikesherov> we say we support only certain browsers, but that's a lie
[09:40:41] <DaveMethvin> we need a single place for that list anyway
[09:40:45] <DaveMethvin> docs.jquery.com is soon to die
[09:40:51] <mikesherov> yes, I've complained to addy about that
[09:40:55] <DaveMethvin> but we have similar lists sprinkled around
[09:41:00] <DaveMethvin> all wrong :D
[09:41:06] <mikesherov> right
[09:41:07] <DaveMethvin> but wrong in different ways
[09:41:22] <mikesherov> I've never ran the jQuery unit tests in anything other than our "supported" browsers
[09:41:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah i haven't done mobile browser testing
[09:41:43] <mikesherov> it wasn't until "simplify offset" did I even think about mobile
[09:41:54] <DaveMethvin> i do run the ui unit tests on occassion and before each release
[09:41:58] <mikesherov> that's a big gap in our process and stated goals
[09:42:07] <mikesherov> but I digress,
[09:42:10] <timmywil> the desktop list is good. I don't think we need to say we support safari 4, but we should be communicating with the mobile team about what will make their lives harder if we remove.
[09:42:19] <mikesherov> timmywil: I'm waiting on confirm from jQm
[09:42:39] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i don't see that i have privs to create a repo on github.com/jquery
[09:42:47] <rwaldron> nuts
[09:42:51] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yt?
[09:42:51] <timmywil> I'm not saying we can't remove the offset fallbacks, but that's particularly hard to replace if we remove it.
[09:42:54] <jaubourg> +1 on the nuts remark
[09:43:00] <mikesherov> timmywil: you're 100% right
[09:43:00] <DaveMethvin> we'll get it created somehow
[09:43:02] <rwaldron> rworth yt?
[09:43:03] <jzaefferer> hey rwaldron, whats up?
[09:43:07] <rwaldron> hey!
[09:43:10] <jaubourg> hey jorn
[09:43:21] <rwaldron> do you have repo creation privs on github.com/jquery ?
[09:43:26] <rwaldron> jzaefferer ^
[09:43:37] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:43:42] <rwaldron> awesome
[09:43:49] <jzaefferer> <- proud owner
[09:43:57] <rwaldron> Would you mind creating a new empty repo named "jquery-browser"
[09:43:59] <rwaldron> :)
[09:44:05] <jzaefferer> maybe?
[09:44:21] <DaveMethvin> oh pretty please?
[09:44:24] <jzaefferer> is this a good time "GET OFF MY LAWN!"?
[09:44:24] <jaubourg> <= gotta fly
[09:44:30] <DaveMethvin> cyl jaubourg
[09:44:32] <jzaefferer> *for
[09:44:32] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[09:44:38] <rwaldron> jzaefferer hahaha
[09:44:46] <rwaldron> jaubourg later dude
[09:44:47] <rwaldron> :)
[09:44:51] <jzaefferer> are you planning an "official plugin"?
[09:45:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, to extract the poison from core
[09:45:14] <jzaefferer> to deprecate $.browser or to actually remove it?
[09:45:17] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yessir
[09:45:23] <rwaldron> release with 1.8
[09:45:26] <rwaldron> remove in 1.9
[09:45:26] <jzaefferer> (looking for the create button)
[09:45:41] <jzaefferer> who's going to maintain it? core team?
[09:45:48] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: yeah
[09:45:51] <mikesherov> I'll maintain it:
[09:46:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it will be too hairy
[09:46:18] <mikesherov> jQuery.browser = function(){ console.log('DONT DO THIS!');};
[09:46:28] <DaveMethvin> jquery-browser: because jquery-dont-use-this-evar was too long
[09:46:40] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: until you see people with feature request for mobile and desktop OS detection ;-)
[09:46:51] <DaveMethvin> oh louisremi don't even THINK it
[09:47:12] <DaveMethvin> but even then, if people want a bloated jquery-browser plugin it's better than having that in core
[09:48:06] <jzaefferer> tada: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-browser
[09:48:19] <jzaefferer> "jQuery Core Commiters" should have write access already
[09:48:26] <DaveMethvin> thanks jzaefferer
[09:48:39] <jzaefferer> once someone pushes something, you can see my awesome description as well :-)
[09:48:43] <DaveMethvin> hey imma have to run in a sec, are there any big issues left?
[09:49:17] * timmywil says 'MySQL server has gone away'
[09:49:25] <timmywil> heh
[09:49:33] <DaveMethvin> oh small problem
[09:49:35] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:49:46] <timmywil> thanks all
[09:49:55] <DaveMethvin> i've been so lonely since MySQL went away
[09:50:02] <timmywil> inorite
[09:50:12] <DaveMethvin> thankyouverymuch
[09:50:13] <mikesherov> MySQL went away! Where did it go?
[09:50:15] <rwaldron> thanks jzaefferer
[09:50:21] <mikesherov> Report 103!
[09:50:24] <rwaldron> shit
[09:50:24] <mikesherov> that's the culprit
[09:50:30] <rwaldron> the default repo is empty
[09:50:39] <rwaldron> so i cant fork
[09:50:45] <timmywil> setting mode then
[09:50:47] <rwaldron> and make a PR
[09:50:50] <DaveMethvin> does it need a dummy file?
[09:51:03] <DaveMethvin> alright, adios my friends
