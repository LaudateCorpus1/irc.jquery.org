[02:01:38] <zs_> hello can you hear me
[02:02:25] <zs_> somebody here
[11:03:09] <toddparker> Ok, fixed
[11:03:19] <toddparker> The JQuery Team meeting is starting
[11:03:25] <toddparker> chime in if you're here
[11:03:32] <gseguin> hi
[11:03:36] <kinblas> chime
[11:04:09] <scottjehl> hey
[11:04:13] <toddparker> hey buys
[11:04:16] <toddparker> guys
[11:04:23] <toddparker> eating and typing = bad thing
[11:04:50] <toddparker> is _nickel around?
[11:05:13] <gseguin> looks like _nickel is away, I just pinged him on -dev
[11:05:18] <toddparker> k
[11:05:26] <toddparker> so gseguin, you had a question
[11:05:27] <toddparker> question was around that commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a620d97868844f8f5b0721bc07d24f415d66ed1c
[11:05:28] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (22h, 56m ago): Re-uses the boolean create at creation time to let the refresh functions know that they've been called by create
[11:05:36] <toddparker> i think this is a good scottjehl q
[11:05:50] <scottjehl> looking
[11:06:05] <gseguin> wow like the socialhapy bot
[11:06:36] <toddparker> what's that?
[11:06:55] <gseguin> when you posted the github url
[11:07:14] <gseguin> socialhapy happy grabbed the description of the commit and posted it
[11:07:23] <peol> yeah...
[11:07:26] <toddparker> cool
[11:07:28] <peol> it takes pulls and issues too
[11:07:29] <peol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2298
[11:07:29] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by h-andreas (11h, 31m ago): More options for selectmenus
[11:07:33] <toddparker> oh, i see now
[11:07:38] <scottjehl> so the question on that commit?
[11:07:39] <gseguin> very nice!
[11:07:48] <gseguin> can we have socialhapy on -dev?
[11:08:01] <toddparker> dunno who sets that up
[11:08:16] <peol> me
[11:08:21] <peol> gseguin: he's in #jquery-dev already
[11:08:24] <gseguin> oh goodie!
[11:08:29] <toddparker> scottjehl
[11:08:30] <toddparker> the create flag was not being sent to refresh at create time
[11:08:30] <toddparker> and I was wondering if you had any idea why
[11:08:35] <gseguin> jquerymobile-dev I meant
[11:08:57] <gseguin> yeah back to that
[11:09:09] <scottjehl> hmm no not sure why
[11:09:26] <gseguin> scottjehl: ok that's fine
[11:09:34] <toddparker> so adding it is ok?
[11:09:46] <gseguin> scottjehl: re-using it solved pretty much all my problems
[11:09:52] <scottjehl> think so? if it tests out, it makes sense to me
[11:10:01] <toddparker> cool
[11:10:10] <toddparker> just wanted to close that one out from earlier
[11:10:26] <toddparker> ok, so kinblas seems like the new transitions are pretty close now
[11:10:35] * kinblas grumbles
[11:10:38] <kinblas> I was playing with it lastnight
[11:10:40] <toddparker> now that we understand the case of those darn properties
[11:10:44] <kinblas> and noticed that on iPad
[11:10:54] <kinblas> there is a flash on reverse transitions
[11:11:02] <kinblas> where the 'to' page
[11:11:05] <kinblas> doesn't animate
[11:11:09] <kinblas> so things like
[11:11:15] <kinblas> slideup, slidedown, and pop
[11:11:17] <kinblas> are affected
[11:11:21] <toddparker> a flas instead of a transition or after the transition finishes?
[11:11:24] <kinblas> I'm currently trying to figure out why
[11:11:42] <kinblas> it's as if as soon as we add the classes to start the transition, the 'to' page flashes to the top
[11:11:44] <toddparker> 4.2?
[11:11:46] <kinblas> and then goes where it should
[11:11:46] <toddparker> 3.2?
[11:11:53] <kinblas> 4.3.5
[11:12:11] <toddparker> top as in z-index
[11:12:22] <gseguin> toddparker: you beat me to it
[11:12:33] <toddparker> or scroll position
[11:12:33] <kinblas> yeah that's all set up
[11:12:47] <toddparker> ?
[11:12:48] <kinblas> anyways, I'm playing with it now
[11:12:51] <toddparker> ok
[11:12:54] <kinblas> to see if I cna fix it
[11:13:02] <kinblas> I've spent the last few days ... of spare time
[11:13:04] <toddparker> and you're pulling opera out
[11:13:09] <kinblas> trying to fix up the transition tests
[11:13:11] * _nickel is here
[11:13:12] <toddparker> so we just have webkit, moz
[11:13:22] <toddparker> are we doing non-prefixed too?
[11:13:30] <toddparker> hey _nickel
[11:13:45] <kinblas> oh, we nee dto pull the -o rules from the transition CSS
[11:13:50] <kinblas> I'll comment them out
[11:13:59] <kinblas> btw, have you seen the latest opera mobile?
[11:13:59] <toddparker> think so, right ghislain?
[11:14:05] <kinblas> It always uses a slide transition
[11:14:08] <kinblas> between pages
[11:14:11] <toddparker> opera?
[11:14:11] <gseguin> yes
[11:14:17] <toddparker> mobile?
[11:14:19] <kinblas> it was a bit disorienting for me at first
[11:14:24] <kinblas> because I thought it was us
[11:14:24] <toddparker> mini slides
[11:14:28] <kinblas> but then I went to other sites
[11:14:31] <gseguin> what? havent's tried latest version
[11:14:33] <_nickel> kinblas: can we just remove them? I'm against commenting out when we have scm :(
[11:14:38] * _nickel is nitpicking
[11:14:43] <kinblas> what's scm?
[11:14:49] <_nickel> source control management
[11:14:52] <kinblas> oh heh
[11:14:56] <toddparker> what's that ;)
[11:15:00] <_nickel> toddparker: :D
[11:15:05] <kinblas> no problemo not a big deal
[11:15:13] <toddparker> so nix the rules
[11:15:20] <kinblas> was thinking it was documentation to show folks we are aware they exist
[11:15:33] <kinblas> I'll remove
[11:15:37] <toddparker> miketaylr will give us a heads up when opera releases a version with better transitions and we'll add them right in
[11:15:48] <miketaylr> yep
[11:16:10] <toddparker> miketaylr - desktop opera supports these now, but the issue is that is kills perf on mobile, right?
[11:16:13] <kinblas> so question about opera mobile
[11:16:20] <toddparker> so we need to nix opera transitions across the board
[11:16:20] <miketaylr> essentially, toddparker
[11:16:33] <miketaylr> for the transitions, yes
[11:16:39] <toddparker> just making sure i'm square on this stuff
[11:16:44] <toddparker> thanks miketaylr
[11:16:48] <miketaylr> np
[11:16:57] <kinblas> so for opera mobile, we disable ajax too?
[11:17:01] <toddparker> shoot kinblas, while we have miketaylr here
[11:17:18] <kinblas> that is, we're doing it for both mini and mobile?
[11:17:30] <kinblas> er ... we're disabling ajax for both mini and mobile?
[11:17:34] <toddparker> mini is opted out of the the ajax nav
[11:17:40] <toddparker> so transitions are moot
[11:17:45] <kinblas> what about mobile
[11:17:54] <toddparker> mobile is a full browser so it gets the ajax nav and transitions
[11:18:00] <miketaylr> mobile does AJAX or pushState just fine
[11:18:06] <toddparker> but perf is not up to snuff
[11:18:07] <kinblas> hmmm ok, it seemed to be loading new pages
[11:18:14] <kinblas> hence the discovery of slidig
[11:18:17] <kinblas> sliding it does
[11:18:24] <toddparker> mobile?
[11:18:26] <kinblas> yeah
[11:18:32] <miketaylr> have a test page?
[11:18:38] <scottjehl> I think Mobile is opted into the ajax nav
[11:18:40] <kinblas> I'll try it again ... make sure I wasn't on crack
[11:18:53] <toddparker> ok
[11:18:56] <kinblas> miketaylr: I was using jqm docs
[11:18:58] <miketaylr> you can ping me at miket@opera.com if you need some help kinblas
[11:18:59] <toddparker> put down that pipe
[11:19:02] <scottjehl> or (it passes the media query test)
[11:19:06] <kinblas> miketaylr: ok thanks
[11:19:36] <toddparker> so the net of all this transition work is that things pretty much look the same as they do now with keyframes
[11:19:44] <kinblas> lol
[11:19:50] <toddparker> tho it gives us the ability to easily add other platforms
[11:19:59] <toddparker> like FF and Oera
[11:20:01] <kinblas> yeah, I'm worried about perception
[11:20:11] <kinblas> there are still browser bugs related to all this stuff
[11:20:16] <scottjehl> a little less code weight too right? keyframes are more verbose?
[11:20:19] <toddparker> tho FF mobile doesn't seem to support this *yet*, only desktop 5+ me thinks
[11:20:26] <kinblas> so the expectation that switching was going to solve everything is wrong
[11:20:31] <toddparker> yeah
[11:20:51] <miketaylr> you can blame me if it ever comes up ^_^
[11:20:51] <toddparker> if things are HW accelerated, that solves the issue. but most aren't yet
[11:20:55] <toddparker> heh
[11:20:55] <kinblas> smaller CSS ... but more code ... and timers (yuck!) to manage the start of the animations
[11:21:11] <toddparker> IT'S ALL MIKETAYLR'S FAULT
[11:21:16] <toddparker> I feel better now
[11:21:26] <miketaylr> that's basically a keynote right there
[11:21:26] <kinblas> miketaylr: blame for what?
[11:21:40] <miketaylr> kinblas: whatever you'd like :P
[11:21:41] <scottjehl> well keyframes or not, we're going to get scroll-jumping on any browser that doesn't support scrolling-overflow:touch anyway. (once we implement that, at least)
[11:21:44] <toddparker> do we know of any improvements in quality or compatibility on this switch?
[11:21:58] <scottjehl> miketaylr - any plans to support that in Opera?
[11:22:03] <toddparker> (not second guessing, thinking about the blog post)
[11:22:10] <kinblas> for what it's worth, transitions are a bit faster on Android, but I think that's mainly due to the fact that it doesn't have to look things up in the CSS keyframe rules every iteration
[11:22:12] <miketaylr> scrolling-overflow? i can find out
[11:22:13] * scottjehl hopes
[11:22:55] <toddparker> miketaylr - also ask if they are going to couple that with that [roperty above. that is essential.
[11:23:37] <miketaylr> with which property?
[11:23:45] <scottjehl> we're likely going to base our truly fixed toolbars on that property's existence
[11:23:49] <toddparker> sorry, scrolling-overflow plus overflow
[11:23:52] <scottjehl> -webkit-scrolling-overflow: touch
[11:23:54] <miketaylr> (sorry, haven't been following)
[11:23:54] <toddparker> the former is the key part
[11:24:01] <miketaylr> got it
[11:24:02] <scottjehl> (not just webkit)
[11:24:09] <scottjehl> well, currently it's only ios5
[11:24:21] <scottjehl> but we'd write tests for all vendors
[11:24:25] <toddparker> but we hope everyone follows this model
[11:24:42] <toddparker> it will get you true fixed toolbars and silky transitions
[11:25:13] <toddparker> so kinblas - do you know when this may land?
[11:25:52] <kinblas> toddparker: well I was sort of waiting to hear the verdict from you on WebOS, WP7, and Symbian ... and then of course there's the 'reverse' problem I'm looking into at the moment
[11:26:05] <kinblas> I got the unit tests green btw on the branch
[11:26:15] <toddparker> oh, did you miss my test results on Friday?
[11:26:19] <kinblas> but that's not testing visual aspects, just mechanics
[11:26:21] <toddparker> those are all at parity
[11:26:31] <toddparker> they look good
[11:26:32] <kinblas> oh I didn't see a reply
[11:26:45] <kinblas> or I saw something but I thought it was dated during July
[11:26:50] <toddparker> i did it here on IRC in -dev,sorry email would have been better
[11:26:50] <kinblas> when I was out
[11:26:54] <toddparker> heh
[11:26:56] <kinblas> oh then I missed it
[11:27:07] <kinblas> just an FYI, i've been *VERY* distracted by a couple of things internally
[11:27:12] <toddparker> nope. i did a full batch of testing last week on your branch
[11:27:13] <toddparker> no red flags
[11:27:30] <kinblas> ok I'll look for the email
[11:27:30] <toddparker> my bad, sorry
[11:27:37] <toddparker> IRC is not a good medium for that stuff
[11:27:42] <kinblas> I havne't really touched the CSS/js part of the transitions stuff since last week
[11:27:55] <kinblas> so things should still be the same as when you tested
[11:28:10] <kinblas> anyways, my concern at the moment is iPad/reverse
[11:28:14] <kinblas> I'll get back to you today on that
[11:28:22] <toddparker> Do you need an email from me? I can tell you that all on our test devices, things seemed at least at party with /test/
[11:28:29] <kinblas> lol
[11:28:29] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:28:31] <kinblas> yes Please
[11:28:41] <kinblas> I'm suffering from scatter-brain-syndrome
[11:28:44] <toddparker> just listing what i tested
[11:28:50] * kinblas has a finger in too many pies at the moment
[11:28:52] <toddparker> k
[11:29:05] <toddparker> so _nickel - what are you up to now?
[11:29:15] <toddparker> I've been assgning select issues to you BTW
[11:29:18] <_nickel> replacestate
[11:29:23] <_nickel> yah I've seen those
[11:29:26] <toddparker> awesome.
[11:29:29] <scottjehl> how's that goin
[11:29:31] <gseguin> kinblas: I have iOS 5 on an iPad2 here if needed
[11:29:34] <_nickel> pretty well
[11:29:39] <_nickel> I have one more bug to work out
[11:29:43] <_nickel> but the tests are proving to be a bitch
[11:29:45] <scottjehl> I saw you mentioned the double dialogs
[11:29:51] <scottjehl> good catch
[11:30:05] <_nickel> yah Kins work in nav handled all of that
[11:30:20] <_nickel> the one left is the initial hash
[11:30:27] <_nickel> doesn't seem to work
[11:30:34] <scottjehl> man, we should have a light version of this that doesn't make exceptions for multi-page, dialogs, nested lists. much simpler
[11:30:53] <scottjehl> sorry, tangent
[11:30:54] <_nickel> the tests are really difficult though
[11:31:01] <scottjehl> initial hash - is that the thing I pointed out?
[11:31:04] <_nickel> all thats left is the main nav tests
[11:31:07] <_nickel> everything else passes
[11:31:10] <_nickel> scottjehl: not sure
[11:31:11] <scottjehl> no forward button in Chrome
[11:31:20] <_nickel> I don't know if its related
[11:31:23] <scottjehl> when you back up to the first page
[11:31:25] <scottjehl> k
[11:31:35] <_nickel> when I go to the docs and I enter something like
[11:31:48] <kinblas> oh I remember mentioning a chrome bug related to history
[11:31:48] <_nickel> domain.com/#/foo/bar/baz.html
[11:32:00] <kinblas> in an issue a while back
[11:32:05] <_nickel> resuls in just the page at domain.com/
[11:32:08] <_nickel> *results
[11:32:24] <scottjehl> k
[11:32:37] <scottjehl> that's odd
[11:32:48] <kinblas> what is the bug?
[11:32:49] <scottjehl> so anything on a root domain or what?
[11:32:58] <_nickel> scottjehl: I have no idea
[11:33:02] <_nickel> haven't tested it extesively
[11:33:06] <_nickel> *extensively
[11:33:12] <_nickel> BUT
[11:33:19] <scottjehl> k.
[11:33:28] <_nickel> there is one other thing that ties in here
[11:33:41] <_nickel> that I talked with kin and gseguin about this morning
[11:33:48] <_nickel> that is browser state in the tests
[11:34:26] <_nickel> so much pain in trying to get the tests to work with both pushstate and hash
[11:34:32] <_nickel> because of the page state etc
[11:34:35] <scottjehl> hmm. a url like this seems to work fine for me http://filamentgroup.com/examples/pushstate/#/examples/pushstate/docs/toolbars/index.html
[11:34:57] <scottjehl> i thought we were going to test pushstate separately?
[11:35:21] <_nickel> we are
[11:35:26] <_nickel> we're testing it twice
[11:35:37] <_nickel> "separately"
[11:35:44] <_nickel> we can't write two sets of tests
[11:35:54] <scottjehl> ok
[11:36:04] <_nickel> that would be impossible to maintain
[11:36:23] <_nickel> right now I'm stuck duplicating the fixtures which is bad enough
[11:36:28] <_nickel> most of them pass
[11:36:30] <toddparker> so same tests, run with and w/o PS
[11:36:33] <_nickel> yes
[11:36:49] <_nickel> and only modifying tests that check the url as part of the test
[11:36:59] <_nickel> content based tests stay the same
[11:37:27] <_nickel> anyway
[11:37:34] <_nickel> I have a solution to our browser state testing woes
[11:37:34] <scottjehl> I noticed one other (much more minor) thing. If jQ + jQM are loaded dynamically, pushstate doesn't end up getting initialized. I think it's because registerInternalEvents doesn't fire. calling init myself made it work fine
[11:37:48] <scottjehl> something to keep in mind for later anyway
[11:37:51] <_nickel> ok
[11:38:05] <_nickel> so I'm going to continue to work on getting the tests working as is today
[11:38:10] <toddparker> so we just have those 2 issues plus the tests to work out?
[11:38:17] <_nickel> but if I run into too much more resistence I might go off and solve that problem
[11:38:17] <toddparker> great
[11:38:28] <kinblas> scottjehl: could be because loading is async and happens after the domready/load fires?
[11:38:35] <scottjehl> we usually dynamically load jq and such in client projects.
[11:38:47] <scottjehl> domready still fires
[11:38:57] <kinblas> scottjehl: after the JS loads?
[11:39:00] <scottjehl> anyway, not a blocker
[11:39:20] <kinblas> scottjehl: anyways, we'll talk on dev
[11:39:24] <scottjehl> yeah. if you call $(foo) in the console, it'll execute
[11:39:27] <_nickel> whats the schedule for beta 3?
[11:39:36] <_nickel> I want to know if I'm pressed for time
[11:40:00] <kinblas> we really need to ship 1.0 by september
[11:40:07] <toddparker> i'd like to get B3 out in the next week or two at the latest
[11:40:11] <toddparker> we do
[11:40:15] <_nickel> alright
[11:40:34] <toddparker> that's why we need to button up these bigger changes and focus on bug fixes and perf
[11:40:45] <_nickel> so is this the last big change?
[11:40:52] <_nickel> aside from the transitions?
[11:41:03] <scottjehl> overflow-scrolling
[11:41:05] <toddparker> scottjehl - do you think we can get those overflow: powered fixed toolbars and transitions in for b3?
[11:41:10] <toddparker> read my mind
[11:41:10] <scottjehl> I've been working on that one
[11:41:40] <toddparker> i sort of feel like we need to get this in because it's really the only way forward for improving toolbars and transitions
[11:41:41] <scottjehl> it's super easy to pull off for normal pages. basically, we just set the page's height instead of min-height, and apply that property.
[11:41:57] <scottjehl> however, for fixed toolbars, we have to set height on the content div and overflow that instead
[11:42:12] <toddparker> ...and this can then support a polyfill like scrollview if neded?
[11:42:19] <scottjehl> so it gets complicated, butI've been working on it
[11:42:53] <scottjehl> toddparker: yeah maybe. Still not sure that's something we should recommend, but for a phonegap app I could see that
[11:42:57] <toddparker> can you all think of any other bigger changes we need to do to get things in good shape for 1.0?
[11:43:16] <kinblas> toddparker: 2 other issues
[11:43:23] <toddparker> oh, we were going to add an extensibility hook somewhere to help devs doing dynamic stuff
[11:43:26] <scottjehl> those are all I know of. Oh, lastscroll
[11:43:30] <kinblas> I've seen folks turning off transitions and couplaining about double clicks
[11:43:37] <toddparker> lastscroll definitely needs to be fixed
[11:43:40] <_nickel> I need time after this pushstate to deal with the select menu bugs
[11:43:44] <toddparker> ticket #?
[11:43:45] <_nickel> and then to fix this testing problem
[11:43:47] <kinblas> toddparker: right the 2nd was the extensibility hook
[11:43:48] <_nickel> and get out server set up
[11:43:57] <scottjehl> we've got a fix for lastscroll that I'd like to improve and land
[11:44:24] <scottjehl> ooh. yeah extensibility hook
[11:44:31] <scottjehl> can we discuss the high-level plan for that?
[11:44:42] <toddparker> we need to tag these few items w/b3
[11:45:00] <kinblas> I think we just need an encode/decode hook for updating the location
[11:45:05] <scottjehl> like, are you thinking it'd just be an even that you could bind to, where the first arg is the server response, and you could return whatever string you want?
[11:45:11] <kinblas> default for this messes with hashes (our default)
[11:45:14] <scottjehl> event*
[11:45:27] <kinblas> that is why I was hoping push-state could leverage the same mechanism
[11:45:54] <toddparker> is this the lastscroll ticket? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1774
[11:45:55] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1774 on jquery-mobile, reported by badtoto (2m, 2w ago): about lastscroll in the nightly version
[11:45:59] <kinblas> scottjehl: well there are 2 cases we need to handle
[11:46:06] <kinblas> hashchange urls
[11:46:19] <kinblas> well that's the only case I think
[11:46:20] <kinblas> :-)
[11:46:22] <scottjehl> $( document ).bind( "jqmnavresponse", function( data) { return runMyTemplate( data ); });
[11:46:29] <kinblas> and then on the page change side
[11:46:50] <kinblas> we need code to allow for encoding the URL
[11:47:06] <scottjehl> encoding...
[11:47:21] <kinblas> encoding === I have this page url I just loaded
[11:47:28] <kinblas> i want to save it to the location somehow
[11:47:37] <kinblas> default would be the hash deal we do today
[11:47:41] <kinblas> for someone like jive
[11:47:52] <scottjehl> isn't that $.mobile.path.set ( url ); ?
[11:47:53] <kinblas> they would stuff it in a property that is part of the hash they manage
[11:48:31] <kinblas> hmmmm, I suppose they could monkey patch that
[11:48:33] <scottjehl> hmm... client-side, js-dependent content?
[11:48:56] <scottjehl> this url wouldn't mean anything to the server, or?
[11:49:23] <kinblas> I think its up to the app ... today the hash means nothing to server
[11:49:39] <scottjehl> right, which is why pushstate is critical
[11:49:44] <scottjehl> well, we can hash this out in dev. I think it's lengthy.
[11:50:04] <scottjehl> do you envision the event part being similar to the example above?
[11:50:11] <kinblas> anyways those are the 2 pending things
[11:50:17] <scottjehl> or more of a callback approach?
[11:50:52] <kinblas> regarding the double click issues I've seen floating around in other issues
[11:50:54] <_nickel> so do we have a cutoff yet on the features for 1.0
[11:50:59] * _nickel senses things creeping
[11:51:41] <toddparker> these are the items we've had for a long time
[11:51:53] <kinblas> .. I spent some time last week looking at the case where a touch results in something being hidden, only for the click to be intercepted by a text input of some sort below
[11:51:54] <toddparker> guess the iOS5 overflow is new
[11:52:17] <toddparker> before we move on, do we have a ticket for this extensibility hook?
[11:52:42] <kinblas> I think so
[11:52:47] * kinblas looks
[11:52:54] <toddparker> i want to tag that to B3
[11:53:01] <_nickel> toddparker: yah it just seems like a lot to do and get stable in the next couple of weeks
[11:53:12] <toddparker> i'm going to tag some more stuff this weekend so we have a short list
[11:53:15] <scottjehl> I think part 1 of the hooks is very doable soon
[11:53:26] <toddparker> the hook can be pretty modest

[11:53:28] <gseguin> '
[11:53:28] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #836 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (6m, 4w ago): path.get() needs a callback hook or options to configure how urls get processed
[11:53:32] <scottjehl> a filter callback so people can run the response through a templater
[11:53:54] <gseguin> oops that for options
[11:53:54] <toddparker> ok, assigned to kin and flagged as B3
[11:54:07] <gseguin> man! not my day...
[11:54:16] <scottjehl> then we can make a demo where the server returns markup or json depending on headers, and people can run with it
[11:54:31] <toddparker> gseguin - wrong issue?
[11:54:34] <scottjehl> the url management thing seems like a bigger projects
[11:54:56] <gseguin> toddparker: yeah I misread
[11:55:10] <kinblas> I'll look for it I just can't find it right now
[11:55:15] <toddparker> ok
[11:55:19] <kinblas> and don't want to hold folks up
[11:55:20] <toddparker> tag it when you do
[11:55:23] <toddparker> k
[11:55:29] <scottjehl> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1872
[11:55:30] <kinblas> so can I just finish up something about double click?
[11:55:30] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1872 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 3w ago): Add extensibility hooks to allow for dynamic page creation and mgmt
[11:55:39] <toddparker> sure
[11:55:44] <scottjehl> kinblas go ahead
[11:56:01] <kinblas> I saw some mentions in other transition related issues regarding double click ... because folks are turning off blinky tansitions
[11:56:32] <kinblas> most of the issues I saw had to do with hiding something that was clicked and then some flash of the keyboard because a text input was revealed at the spot where the user had previously touched
[11:56:40] <kinblas> I verified ... we *ARE* canceling the clicks
[11:56:44] <kinblas> but
[11:56:52] <kinblas> the browser gives focus to inputs
[11:56:55] <kinblas> on mousedown
[11:57:15] <kinblas> so it isn't a click problem per-se
[11:57:20] <kinblas> the flash happens because
[11:57:27] <kinblas> the browser gives the text input focus
[11:57:31] <kinblas> but then our page transition code
[11:57:37] <kinblas> gives focus to something else when it is done
[11:57:43] <toddparker> ah
[11:57:59] <kinblas> anyways, what I was thinking was that we really can't perform actions on vclick
[11:58:06] <kinblas> because folks can get into this situation
[11:58:15] <toddparker> so they hide a button when clicked and the browser bounces focus to an input on the page
[11:58:19] <toddparker> before the transition
[11:58:19] <kinblas> I believe it was a select box that was causing this
[11:58:28] <toddparker> saw that one
[11:58:40] <kinblas> toddparker: no it gives focus *AFTER* the transition because there is no transition
[11:58:48] <kinblas> they turned it off by setting default to "none"
[11:58:52] <kinblas> so it hides instantly
[11:58:52] <toddparker> ah.
[11:59:00] <kinblas> before the mouse events are dispatched
[11:59:08] <kinblas> anyways, the only way to get around these bugs
[11:59:11] <kinblas> is to perform the action
[11:59:13] <kinblas> on click
[11:59:15] <toddparker> and is focus on the new page or the old one?
[11:59:27] <kinblas> that way the mouse events are already dispatched before things get hidden
[11:59:40] <kinblas> focus is given to the element below the touch position on the new page
[11:59:45] <kinblas> and that happens to be a text input
[12:00:05] <toddparker> interesting. so random
[12:00:13] <kinblas> anyways ... the same approach for the ajax click is in order here
[12:00:22] <kinblas> we *MUST* perform the action on "click"
[12:00:22] <toddparker> so are you saying we can't use vclick anywhere/
[12:00:29] <kinblas> sucks
[12:00:30] <_nickel> just bind to click then?
[12:00:37] <kinblas> well we can give feedback on vclick
[12:00:50] <kinblas> but the action can't be dispatched till click if you want to avoid all these problems
[12:00:55] <toddparker> so bind to vclcik for flipping active
[12:01:00] <toddparker> but click for the action
[12:01:05] <kinblas> right, instant feedback, delayed action
[12:01:14] <_nickel> ugh
[12:01:17] <toddparker> kin - we really need to write up how to best use vclick in the docs
[12:01:18] <kinblas> sux
[12:01:29] <toddparker> i just added the bare minimum for B1
[12:01:42] <kinblas> yeah, basically vclick isn't good when content changes out from underneath it
[12:01:44] <toddparker> but there is a lot to know about how these work and how to use 'em
[12:01:48] <toddparker> right
[12:02:06] <kinblas> btw, this isn't a vclick immplementation problem
[12:02:12] <kinblas> it's just how the events work on these devices
[12:02:17] <toddparker> so it would be ok for a toggle controlling content below, but if it made the page change or re-flow, it could be bad
[12:02:21] <toddparker> sure
[12:02:32] <kinblas> right
[12:02:38] <kinblas> if you change content underneath the touch
[12:02:40] <kinblas> it's bad
[12:03:13] <kinblas> anyways, I'm done, after delivering that sunshine
[12:03:22] <toddparker> ok
[12:03:29] <toddparker> so is that a change you want to make?
[12:03:37] <kinblas> we need to make it to avoid these problems
[12:03:39] <toddparker> or is this jsut advice
[12:03:45] <kinblas> affects, listview and select (custom)
[12:04:09] <toddparker> so we need to tweak the events on all these
[12:04:19] <kinblas> yeah
[12:04:30] <kinblas> I think folks are seeing it most with selects (custom)
[12:04:39] <kinblas> because those pages tend to have selects and text inputs together
[12:04:43] <toddparker> ok
[12:04:55] <kinblas> actually I think it may be just selects
[12:04:55] <toddparker> can you tag those related for B3?
[12:05:03] <toddparker> better
[12:05:09] <kinblas> I'll have to file a bug ... these are just mentions in transition bugs
[12:05:15] <toddparker> is this critical for B3? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1376
[12:05:16] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1376 on jquery-mobile, reported by StevenBlack (4m, 1w ago): pagebeforeshow event not fired at the correct juncture.
[12:05:24] <toddparker> or still true
[12:06:16] <toddparker> it's an old issue
[12:06:31] <kinblas> I have trouble parsing the original description
[12:07:40] <kinblas> but I believe we now have the state set to the new page before we fire the transitions
[12:07:52] <toddparker> should i ask for confirmation then>
[12:08:12] <toddparker> ok
[12:08:20] <toddparker> sorry we went over
[12:08:29] <toddparker> gseguin - anything we need to cover here?
[12:08:40] <gseguin> no big items here
[12:08:50] <gseguin> going through "critical" bugs
[12:08:54] <scottjehl> yeah that's the issue really
[12:09:02] <scottjehl> re: the page state before all events
[12:09:28] <scottjehl> I'd expect a page to be in it's original state when before[show|hide] events fire
[12:09:42] <gseguin> still need to address that comment: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/dd9ae4898b254cb2d24d303addb2322e3fe07c51#comments
[12:09:43] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (6d, 19h ago): Fix for issue #779Added a ui-li-has-count class for listview items that contain a count bubble. Changed default padding-right to 25px adjusting it to 75px when count bubble is present.
[12:10:00] <scottjehl> but we set active and all that long before those events fire. I think Steven's right that it makes it hard to work with this way
[12:10:32] <toddparker> so is that event timing a pretty easy fix?
[12:10:40] <scottjehl> heh
[12:11:11] <scottjehl> they all fire during transition pages. Seems like they might be better off in changePage
[12:11:18] <scottjehl> transitionpages() rather
[12:11:20] <toddparker> gseguin - i think we may need to add classes for tracking if there is a right arrow btn or a count bubble in lists so we can write padding rules for those cases
[12:11:40] <gseguin> I added the has-count
[12:11:40] <kinblas> scottjehl: There's changepage notifications as well as show/hide notificaitons
[12:11:46] <kinblas> all of those have before notifications
[12:11:52] <gseguin> but not he has-arrow
[12:12:00] <kinblas> so if you want to know before a change is about to happen use beforechangepage
[12:12:05] <toddparker> i think we should probably move this over to dev since we're over on time
[12:12:22] <scottjehl> oh. okay, well that's fair. we need to document that then!
[12:12:23] <kinblas> if you just want to know when the actual show/hide happens use beforepageshow, beforepagehide
[12:12:29] <gseguin> I've got to run to another meeting
[12:12:36] <kinblas> scottjehl: true that
[12:12:38] <kinblas> :-)
[12:12:38] <scottjehl> show/hide used to be what we'd recommend for that
[12:12:40] <gseguin> see y'all on -dev
[12:12:45] <toddparker> ok, let's keep chatting
[12:12:56] <toddparker> i'll move things into B3 and keep triaging
[12:13:00] <toddparker> thanks all
