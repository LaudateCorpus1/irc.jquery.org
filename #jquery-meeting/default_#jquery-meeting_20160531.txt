[14:05:13] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:05:21] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, nashvail, kristyjy
[14:05:25] <nashvail> hey!
[14:05:27] <arschmitz> hi
[14:05:36] <kristy> hey
[14:06:00] <sfrisk> working on getting the document up, but we do have a number of PRs for review
[14:07:15] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:07:35] <sfrisk> kristyjy - any progress on documentation and adding a full width version of tables?
[14:08:35] <kristyjy> afraid I don't have anything to report. Got pretty busy and lost track of time. I still have it in my head it's Monday. I'll try to make some progress this week
[14:09:18] <sfrisk> So based off some of the initial style guide stuff, nashvail has submitted PRs for Inputs, Modals, and Notifications
[14:09:39] <nashvail> Yes
[14:09:50] <nashvail> they are WIP
[14:10:25] <sfrisk> Still, good idea to get some eyes on them
[14:10:29] <arschmitz> so in my opinion colors are not being done correctly there
[14:10:36] <arschmitz> i think they should match buttons
[14:11:35] <nashvail> in the notifications?
[14:11:37] <arschmitz> yes
[14:11:48] <nashvail> alright, noted
[14:12:17] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/blob/master/scss/atoms/buttons/_mixins.scss#L12
[14:12:19] <arschmitz> use a mixin
[14:12:21] <sfrisk> in notifications?
[14:12:23] <arschmitz> to get colors from a map
[14:12:34] <sfrisk> oh wow, way to not scroll down limechat
[14:12:35] <arschmitz> and then set the variable to the map just like buttons do
[14:12:37] <sfrisk> I thought it got super quiet
[14:13:21] <arschmitz> sfrisk: you implemented the button solution thoughts?
[14:14:18] <sfrisk> I thought I had commented on doing things similar to buttons - although with the updated pr, a lot of my comments got hidden
[14:14:37] <arschmitz> oh i may have missed it
[14:14:46] <arschmitz> i noticed based on the questions about jsass last week
[14:15:19] <sfrisk> also the dark notification button is a bit at odds with the default styling for buttons, which is lighter
[14:16:17] <nashvail> guys are we ok with the way colors are retreived from JSASS or not ?
[14:16:48] <arschmitz> nashvail: it should really match button
[14:17:12] <arschmitz> thats how jsass was designed to work we had some pretty length discussion about this when working on buttons and jsass initially
[14:17:42] <nashvail> so you're saying insted of "background": chassis.colors.warning.value.base I assign background to an object which then gets converted to a SASS map and then get colors from the map?
[14:17:47] <arschmitz> in fact i added new features to jsass to support this style
[14:17:59] <arschmitz> no
[14:18:10] <sfrisk> I think the reason nashvail opted to go with the direct color is because the default notification uses a dark color
[14:18:18] <sfrisk> while the current default map is for light colors
[14:18:19] <nashvail> yes that's right
[14:18:27] <sfrisk> so "base" doesn't work for default
[14:18:45] <arschmitz> right so dont pass base to the function?
[14:19:11] <arschmitz> the mixin from buttons i linked has a required param
[14:19:22] <arschmitz> that is the color variation
[14:19:22] <sfrisk> which I'm still not sure how I feel about default notification being super dark
[14:19:43] <sfrisk> unless we want a light default option and a dark default option
[14:19:58] <arschmitz> color wise it should jive with our current pallet
[14:20:04] <arschmitz> dark seems out of place
[14:20:20] <arschmitz> i think a secondary pallet is a good idea in the future
[14:20:25] <arschmitz> but lets get something usable first
[14:20:51] <arschmitz> we were all happy with buttons and their pallet
[14:21:02] <arschmitz> i think we should maintain that unless there is some new compelling reason not to
[14:22:34] <sfrisk> Also I think that while showing the code for how to do notifications is a good idea - I'm not sure if this is the best PR to introduce a new CSS theme for showing code samples
[14:22:55] <sfrisk> especially since the method you're using involves having to write out everything 2x - only the second time the ascii way
[14:23:10] <sfrisk> arschmitz, I remember liking what jquery mobile was doing for showing the code for demos
[14:23:11] <arschmitz> yeah...
[14:23:21] <sfrisk> that prevented writing everything 2x
[14:23:24] <arschmitz> yup
[14:23:31] <arschmitz> there are a few ways to do that
[14:23:37] <arschmitz> all fairly simple
[14:23:55] <sfrisk> I worry about the current solution in this PR, mostly because it's easy to accidentally type the wrong thing and miss it
[14:24:02] <sfrisk> Especially when we get to more complicated components
[14:24:39] <arschmitz> this is a simplified version
[14:24:41] <arschmitz> https://rawgit.com/arschmitz/jqueryui-bootstrap-adapter/master/index.html
[14:24:48] <arschmitz> of what mobile does i use on a few things
[14:25:14] <arschmitz> the html looks like https://github.com/arschmitz/jqueryui-bootstrap-adapter/blob/master/index.html
[14:26:08] <arschmitz> it is keyed off the class sample container
[14:26:15] <arschmitz> it pulls out style and script tags
[14:26:20] <arschmitz> and renders them
[14:26:55] <arschmitz> the mobile version is a bit more complicated
[14:27:01] <arschmitz> it uses ids to link to the parts
[14:27:13] <arschmitz> and renders them as seperate js / css / html tabs
[14:27:34] <sfrisk> I don't think we would need seperate js/css/html tabs
[14:27:40] <sfrisk> just the html code, like in your example
[14:28:04] <arschmitz> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/table-reflow-heading-groups/
[14:28:24] <arschmitz> yeah i agree thats why i made that version i like it better for simple things then the mobile one
[14:30:02] <arschmitz> so that is really simple its just
[14:30:25] <arschmitz> syntax.js + https://github.com/arschmitz/jqueryui-bootstrap-adapter/blob/master/demo/code_sample.js
[14:33:32] <sfrisk> So, open up an issue to maybe add that (or at least get community feedback for any other possible solutions)
[14:33:42] <sfrisk> and remove it from the current notifications PR
[14:33:52] <arschmitz> seems like a good idea
[14:34:01] <arschmitz> im happy to work on that once a decision is made
[14:34:08] <arschmitz> iv implemented different versions several times
[14:34:12] <nashvail> the cyaman theme?
[14:34:20] <nashvail> cayman*
[14:34:39] <arschmitz> we can theme however we like
[14:35:16] <nashvail> ok so remove external theming library from the PR
[14:36:10] <nashvail> we have an issue for the demo page and code snippets styling https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/162
[14:36:49] <sfrisk> okay, but take what's in the notification PR for showing how to do the code out
[14:36:55] <arschmitz> we can use our own syntax highlightor css if we would like or use the provided with our chosen solution
[14:37:06] <sfrisk> since the solution we're talking about means we don't have to write everything out 2x
[14:37:30] <sfrisk> and ensures in more complicated component, we're less likely to have mistakes
[14:37:33] <arschmitz> we will also want to impose a structure for how this works
[14:37:52] <arschmitz> like in my page i wrap all samples in a div with a special class to make it work
[14:38:19] <arschmitz> we will likely want something similar
[14:39:13] <arschmitz> or we could make each sample its own file
[14:39:21] <arschmitz> and pull them in as part of build step
[14:39:25] <arschmitz> many options
[14:39:39] <sfrisk> arschmitz, do you want to include links to your example in the issue?
[14:39:46] <arschmitz> sure
[14:39:52] <sfrisk> please and thank you
[14:40:09] <arschmitz> its probably the simpilist solution
[14:41:37] <arschmitz> FYI seperate files is how UI does it
[14:41:39] <nashvail> and the default notification color? we're sticking with the current dark one(#333) ?
[14:41:53] <arschmitz> i think we all said it should match buttons
[14:41:54] <arschmitz> so no
[14:41:57] <arschmitz> ?
[14:42:15] <nashvail> that would allow colors to be retrieved from maps
[14:42:54] <arschmitz> i meant it should not be dark
[14:43:01] <arschmitz> it should match the theme we have already
[14:43:28] <nashvail> the color palette in the colors.js file
[14:48:58] <sfrisk> the issue with occasionally using dark and occasionally using light is that we don't seem to have a rule behind when to use dark and when to use light "default" colors
[14:49:31] <sfrisk> as asrchmitz mentioned earlier, we could add a secondary pallet in the future
[14:49:56] <sfrisk> but right now we're working on the initial pass of all the components to be in our phase one release, using the palette that we have
[14:50:09] <sfrisk> unless we can come up with a compelling reason to add/change that pallet
[14:50:33] <nashvail> makes sense
[14:51:23] <arschmitz> sfrisk: thats exactly what i was saying
[14:51:39] <sfrisk> Well just summing up what was said up above
[14:51:43] <sfrisk> totally agreeing with you
[14:53:45] <sfrisk> :-)
[14:54:58] <arschmitz> yeah i was just agreeing with you lol
[14:55:24] <nashvail> and any issues with the Modals PR so far?
[14:55:44] <arschmitz> well aside from the several we just talked about none i have noticed yet
[14:57:45] <sfrisk> and can pull stuff into branches if we want so it can be viewable on views.css-chassis.com
[15:00:42] <arschmitz> yup
[15:01:03] <sfrisk> okay, I need to get back to work
[15:01:14] <sfrisk> I'm on breakfix this week, ALL the bugssss
[15:01:27] <sfrisk> see everyone in #css-chassis
