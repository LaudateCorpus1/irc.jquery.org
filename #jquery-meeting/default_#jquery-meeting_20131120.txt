[08:35:25] <jzaefferer> Thanks for the reminder JamesMGreene
[08:37:02] <jzaefferer> Do you have any updates?
[08:37:10] <jzaefferer> Looks like Timo isn't here
[08:40:42] <JamesMGreene> Nope :-|
[08:41:11] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: would you have time to review those docs PRs?
[08:41:20] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/28 and https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/pull/55
[08:41:21] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #28 by jugglinmike (2w 2d ago): Document QUnit.push
[08:41:27] <JamesMGreene> Side project is from hell... had a big fight with my client, ended up cutting him out of the middle to work directly with his client (my indirect client)
[08:41:34] <JamesMGreene> I'll take a look right now
[08:42:16] <jzaefferer> sounds like fun
[08:42:26] <JamesMGreene> indeed
[08:42:31] <jzaefferer> I want to get those merged and see if the guy is willing to work on some other docs issues
[08:42:54] <jzaefferer> otherwise I got nothing, my jQuery time goes to UI currently
[08:44:49] <JamesMGreene> Should we be discouraging the expect-count-as-an-argument syntax?
[08:45:12] <JamesMGreene> i.e. `test("blah", 1, function(assert) { ... });
[08:45:13] <JamesMGreene> `
[08:45:52] <jzaefferer> ah, yes
[08:45:58] <jzaefferer> I'd like to get rid of that
[08:46:24] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/356
[08:46:24] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #356 by jzaefferer (11mon 3w ago): Deprecate/remove expect argument from test() and asyncTest()
[08:49:41] <JamesMGreene> (That is used in Mike's PR for the cookbook)
[08:51:00] <jzaefferer> right
[08:51:03] <jzaefferer> can you comment on that?
[08:51:29] <JamesMGreene> sure thing
[08:51:34] <JamesMGreene> I'll leave comments on each PR
[08:51:38] <JamesMGreene> Anything else to discuss?
[08:52:15] <jzaefferer> I got nothing
[08:54:33] <JamesMGreene> OK. Meeting adjourned?
[08:59:42] <JamesMGreene> Hey jzaefferer, still there?
[09:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: arschmitz gnarf kborchers mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll1
[09:01:45] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:03:47] <arschmitz> big turn out today
[09:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> Heh. Anyone else around?
[09:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:05:18] <tj_vantoll1> Kind of here but in another meeting for about 10 more minutes.
[09:05:18] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: yeah, adjourned; thanks for coming by. Timo should be around again next week.
[09:05:50] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: PM?
[09:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's wait a few minutes to start then.
[09:10:21] <tj_vantoll1> Alright I'm here now.
[09:11:00] <mikesherov_> hello
[09:11:49] <mikesherov_> Just a quick update from me. I have no new news since last meeting, except that DaveStein and I will be working on draggable this week now that I've settled into my new job
[09:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:12:24] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: A ticket just came in that should be easy to fix in master.
[09:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> It works properly in the interactions branch.
[09:12:45] <mikesherov_> cool, just assign it to me
[09:12:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: one of the AMD tasks is to rename files. Neither PR nor wiki page say what the naming should look like - do you have details?
[09:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9671
[09:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: done
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Removing the "jquery." prefix.
[09:14:21] <jzaefferer> but keeping "ui."?
[09:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, umm..maybe not.
[09:15:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: correct me if im wrong but i think ui goes too
[09:15:07] <arschmitz> thats what we decided in austin
[09:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think it does, now that I'm thinking of it again.
[09:15:15] <jzaefferer> define(["ui/autocomplete", ...) <- that suggest they both go
[09:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:18:06] <jzaefferer> a simple rename shouldn't be a big deal for git, so we can do the rename any time?
[09:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm assuming kborchers and rxaviers won't show up today since they're at a conference.
[09:18:38] <jzaefferer> rename files, all references in html and gruntfile?
[09:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Any update on button?
[09:21:22] <arschmitz> yeah have the widget all updated and working with new markup
[09:21:37] <arschmitz> just changing a few things based on our conversation earlier
[09:22:02] <arschmitz> also started working on the css and markup for checkbox
[09:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. So you'll push soon?
[09:22:27] <arschmitz> yeah probably before the end of the day
[09:22:43] <arschmitz> i can ping anyone interested when i do
[09:23:37] <arschmitz> would you prefer button and checkbox in separate or the same branch since they depend on each other but are different widgets?
[09:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> You can put them in the same branch.
[09:24:01] <arschmitz> ok
[09:24:07] <jzaefferer> I'd say everything that affects what button currently contains can go in one branch
[09:24:21] <arschmitz> sounds good that is easiest
[09:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I went through the dialog tests and get them passing.
[09:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> Though there seems to be intermittent failures in Opera 15.
[09:25:50] <tj_vantoll1> Well Opera 18 is latest now.
[09:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to get TestSwarm updated.
[09:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully it'll pass in newer versions :-P
[09:27:18] <scott_gonzalez> This ticket came in today: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9670
[09:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> About preventing page scroll while a modal dialog is open.
[09:27:49] <scott_gonzalez> I agree with tj_vantoll1's comment that the current behavior is correct.
[09:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> Although native alerts prevent scrolling.
[09:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> But native alerts are also outside of the window.
[09:28:45] <tj_vantoll1> Native alerts also prevent changing tabs in most browsers.
[09:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> We should so what a native dialog does.
[09:29:52] <tj_vantoll1> <dialog> is in canary now right?
[09:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> You can scroll.
[09:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's not even fixed position.
[09:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/uvOQExuh/2/edit
[09:31:34] <tj_vantoll1> Close as plugin then?
[09:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:32:38] <jzaefferer> What is the jsbin supposed to do? I tried in Chrome Canary...
[09:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> It should show you a modal dialog in the page.
[09:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> A white box that says "hello"
[09:34:32] <jzaefferer> not happening
[09:34:50] <tj_vantoll1> Do you need to update?
[09:35:23] <jzaefferer> it claims to be up-to-date
[09:35:39] <jzaefferer> not important
[09:36:34] <arschmitz> since we are talking about dialog http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9578 i looked into and i don't really consider it a bug
[09:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, ticket closed.
[09:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, jzaefferer already returned it to the reporter.
[09:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anything to discuss about datepicker this week?
[09:38:18] <tj_vantoll1> Per our discussion in #jqueryui-dev I'm going to add value() and valueAsDate() methods.
[09:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> Another decision based on HTML :-)
[09:39:09] <tj_vantoll1> Yep. That's about it. I needed those for some tests so I'll add them then keeping expanding the test suite.
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> I started working on the new release script that can be shared across all projects.
[09:40:59] <scott_gonzalez> Making good progress on that. Went over it with jzaefferer this morning.
[09:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> So we should have that ready before the 1.11 release.
[09:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> Probably won't be ready before the next core or Mobile releases though.
[09:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> Since those are coming up pretty quickly.
[09:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
