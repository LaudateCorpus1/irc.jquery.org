[09:00:47] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:01:05] <DaveMethvin> i am at a conf and the wifi is kinda flakey
[09:01:19] <DaveMethvin> but it's working
[09:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like your code ;-)
[09:02:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[09:02:58] <DaveMethvin> so who's here? I updated the agenda
[09:03:29] <DaveMethvin> markelog m_gol timmywil gibson042 and others
[09:03:37] <timmywil> oloh
[09:03:44] <DaveMethvin> ehlo
[09:04:37] <DaveMethvin> anything critical that we should push out in a .2 release?
[09:04:45] <DaveMethvin> i didn't see much
[09:05:01] <DaveMethvin> so i'm ready to start landing some of this
[09:05:07] <DaveMethvin> for 1.12/2.2
[09:05:31] <DaveMethvin> wrap/clone thing lgtm
[09:05:39] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:05:43] <DaveMethvin> hey
[09:06:19] <timmywil> Sizzle assurance is in
[09:06:24] <DaveMethvin> any objection to moving the ajax event aliases into their own file?
[09:06:32] <DaveMethvin> ooh Sizzle Assurance
[09:06:43] <DaveMethvin> when you absolutely positively need the latest Sizzle
[09:06:54] <m_gol> present
[09:07:40] <timmywil> Moving it to its own file is the best solution, but I'd like to make sure we update this https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L42
[09:08:07] <timmywil> it's missing a few things
[09:08:24] <timmywil> like removing event aliases when the events module is removed
[09:08:59] <DaveMethvin> timmywil can you do the updating?
[09:09:05] <m_gol> it'd be great if it could be automated somehow
[09:09:13] <m_gol> we have 2 kind of dependents - optional & hard one
[09:09:20] <m_gol> or weak & hard
[09:09:56] <m_gol> ajax will depend weakly on ajax/event_alias but event_alias will depend strongly on event
[09:10:01] <timmywil> It would be automated if we added event aliases to the list of dependencies for the events module, but I don't want to do that.
[09:10:43] <DaveMethvin> If someone wants a custom build they need to know what they're calling, unfortunatley
[09:10:58] <timmywil> It's a short list anyway
[09:11:02] <m_gol> ok
[09:11:46] <DaveMethvin> if you exclude ajax you don't need ajax/alias so yeah this is another one
[09:11:57] <timmywil> right
[09:12:39] <m_gol> technically it's ajax/alias that depends on both ajax & events
[09:13:27] <timmywil> Actually, I forgot I automated some of this already. Anything in the corresponding folder for a module gets removed with the module.
[09:13:41] <DaveMethvin> alias doesn't really depend on ajax but doesn't make sense to use without it
[09:13:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: did you intend to indent "Scott says yes"? :)
[09:14:00] <m_gol> yeah
[09:14:10] <DaveMethvin> there!
[09:14:23] <m_gol> "intend to indent", hehe
[09:14:41] <DaveMethvin> all of that lgtm
[09:14:52] <DaveMethvin> so how bout that QUnit pull?
[09:15:00] <DaveMethvin> call me lazy but i would prefer the globals
[09:15:17] <markelog> jzaefferer: thoughts?
[09:15:33] <DaveMethvin> we could always just pull them into globals
[09:15:38] <m_gol> you can do `var Q = QUnit`
[09:15:46] <m_gol> Q.assert is not that longer than assert
[09:15:58] <DaveMethvin> collisions with our own globals or locals haven't been a problem in the past afaik
[09:16:21] <markelog> qunit team really wanted to do this
[09:16:29] <DaveMethvin> assert = QUnit.assert would be fine somewhere in our own tests
[09:16:39] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: +1
[09:16:46] <markelog> as far as i remember they were planning to remove globals completely
[09:16:50] <DaveMethvin> i agree that QUnit shouldn't make this decision for you but want globals
[09:16:55] <timmywil> I'd rather not edit 6000 tests
[09:17:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:17:03] <DaveMethvin> that too
[09:17:06] <m_gol> yeah, we can add globals
[09:17:20] <m_gol> I wish we had destructuring ;)
[09:17:31] <m_gol> it would be a one-liner then
[09:17:33] <DaveMethvin> it's one of my favorite new features
[09:18:01] <m_gol> the diff is huge in this PR!
[09:18:26] <DaveMethvin> we use a lot of QUnit stuff :)
[09:18:32] <m_gol> I'm always pissed off when I do git blame & all I find is indent changes & other irrelevant stuff like that ;)
[09:19:17] <markelog> m_gol: maybe you could find that useful - https://github.com/scottgonzalez/recursive-blame
[09:19:54] <m_gol> markelog: I know that. :) Also, WebStorm has it's own recursive blame feature. Still, it's easier to just see it with regular blame annotation
[09:20:05] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez wrote that on the way to Russia!
[09:20:12] <markelog> ))
[09:20:22] <DaveMethvin> but i agree it's aways a pain to have big diffs
[09:20:31] <DaveMethvin> even if these don't really change anything
[09:20:56] <DaveMethvin> re-assigning to globals makes QUnit and us happy so let's do that
[09:20:57] <m_gol> sometimes unavoidable
[09:21:03] <m_gol> if you're adding/removing ifs
[09:21:08] <m_gol> yup
[09:21:22] <DaveMethvin> anybody heard from jaubourg lately?
[09:21:31] <DaveMethvin> i'd really like his input on that Promise pull
[09:22:02] <DaveMethvin> dcherman thanks for that pull btw ... it's not forgotten!
[09:22:09] <m_gol> maybe we could ping him via e-mail?
[09:22:10] <jzaefferer> wat?
[09:22:10] <b-ot> jzaefferer: does not works
[09:22:20] <jzaefferer> thoughts on what?
[09:22:41] <markelog> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1586#issuecomment-44858381
[09:22:45] <DaveMethvin> we're gonna assign to globals rather than qualify everything with QUniit. everywhere
[09:23:52] <DaveMethvin> oh man they're chasing me out of this room, gtg
[09:23:59] <DaveMethvin> i'll catch up with you guys later
[09:24:11] <DaveMethvin> can scott_gonzalez  or jzaefferer  close the room?? thnks
[09:24:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: would be great if you found time to look at the testing PR for sizzle: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/263
[09:24:22] <m_gol> some time ;)
