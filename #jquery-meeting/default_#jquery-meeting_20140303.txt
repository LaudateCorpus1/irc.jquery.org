[09:01:07] <DaveMethvin>  m_gol markelog gibson042 timmywil rwaldron gnarf  it's core meeting time
[09:01:42] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, we have a Bocoup meeting, but I am remote so I can sort of do both
[09:01:58] <DaveMethvin> ok multitask away rwaldron  :)
[09:02:18] <DaveMethvin> let's see if anyone shows up other than us
[09:03:56] <gibson042> phew; made it :)
[09:04:14] <m_gol> present
[09:04:31] <DaveMethvin> awesome!
[09:04:38] <DaveMethvin> ok that's 4 of us
[09:05:08] <m_gol> great, we can make breaking decisions then ;)
[09:05:22] <DaveMethvin> and get the people who aren't here to implement them!
[09:06:07] <DaveMethvin> so m_gol what do we need to do to get that "weekly" job done? Just move the browser sets around in the Gruntfile?
[09:06:53] <m_gol> I'd add a parameter to the testswarm task
[09:06:59] <m_gol> changing the browserset
[09:07:08] <m_gol> and we'd invoke the weekly run with this parameter
[09:07:22] <DaveMethvin> ok sounds good ... can you do that in the next couple of days?
[09:07:25] <m_gol> we'll also need to actually create the proper browserSet but that's not that difficult, I can do it
[09:07:28] <m_gol> sure
[09:07:38] <DaveMethvin> would be so awesome to have tests that succeed more than they fail
[09:07:42] <m_gol> :)
[09:07:51] <m_gol> what's the result of your talks wrt Opera Presto?
[09:08:18] <DaveMethvin> they are still ongoing, i don't think we are going to break much
[09:08:24] <DaveMethvin> but the opera mini thing is tough
[09:08:30] <DaveMethvin> we can't test it
[09:08:32] <m_gol> yeah
[09:08:36] <DaveMethvin> i asked them for help in doing that
[09:08:41] <DaveMethvin> right now it's on opera 11.11
[09:08:44] <m_gol> especially that it's very clever in how it handles JS
[09:08:51] <m_gol> but it's cleverness means problems for us :)
[09:09:07] <DaveMethvin> mainly i just want to be sure nothing breaks really badly
[09:09:11] <DaveMethvin> like script errors
[09:09:13] <gibson042> what cleverness is that?
[09:09:25] <m_gol> as my colleague said, they have a pretty different understanding of what server-side JS means ]:->
[09:09:35] <DaveMethvin> it executes most of the browser stuff on the server
[09:09:42] <DaveMethvin> and then sends the rendered page to the device
[09:09:51] <m_gol> yeah, and makes some decisions about clamping setTimeout/setInterval
[09:09:51] <DaveMethvin> kind of like amazons silk
[09:10:08] <m_gol> it increases low timeout, disregards ops with ones too large
[09:10:09] <DaveMethvin> like settimeout is 5 seconds min or something like that
[09:10:10] <gibson042> got it
[09:10:25] <m_gol> and most of JS is executed on some triggers like events
[09:10:49] <m_gol> it seems impossible for us to fully test that
[09:10:52] <DaveMethvin> but to me as long as we don't have any stuff that just horribly breaks it then i am happy
[09:11:03] <DaveMethvin> and i plan to leave most of that in their lap
[09:11:15] <m_gol> but that, again, might make it worthwile to test on Opera 12.1x for a little longer
[09:11:29] <m_gol> since they plan to upgrade Opera Mini servers to that version
[09:11:37] <DaveMethvin> it's just that they freak out when we say "we're dropping Opera 12.1x support" when all that means is we'll stop unit testing as of 1.13
[09:11:43] <m_gol> and I don't think they're going to switch all that to Blink any time soon...
[09:11:44] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't mean it stops working there
[09:12:15] <DaveMethvin> m_gol i think you said there are two fixes for opera 12
[09:12:23] <DaveMethvin> one is that offset patch where they can be negative
[09:12:33] <DaveMethvin> you'd think THEY could fix that one by making it 0
[09:12:38] <m_gol> but well, we'll not dropping it in 1.12, who knows what's the situation when we ship 1.13 :)
[09:12:41] <DaveMethvin> even if it's not being "maintained"
[09:12:42] <m_gol> haha, right
[09:12:51] <m_gol> especially on servers
[09:13:00] <m_gol> one fix and suddenly everyone has it
[09:13:14] <DaveMethvin> and i'm okay with changing our minds on this if 1.13 time rolls around and there is still lots of X in the world
[09:13:23] <DaveMethvin> where X=IE7 or whatever
[09:13:26] <markelog> one thing that occured to me recently, is that those statistics that we use to justife this solution, might not take into the account that some sites use say IE8 in IE7 mode
[09:13:27] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think there will be in a year
[09:13:42] <m_gol> it'd be nice if they fixed this isse before deploying the new version to servers
[09:13:47] <m_gol> * issue
[09:14:08] <m_gol> bc if they deploy 12.16 I don't see them upgrading from that ever to another Presto version
[09:14:11] <DaveMethvin> markelog good point, i dunno if those browser market share things detect that
[09:14:42] <m_gol> that's mostly for internal sites, though, right?
[09:14:43] <markelog> we use this everywhere in my company
[09:15:01] <m_gol> since IE8 is in IE7 mode by default in intranets
[09:15:06] <DaveMethvin> well we are ASHAMED of you markelog  :)
[09:15:09] <DaveMethvin> tell them to stop!
[09:15:30] <m_gol> yeah, upgrade all that to... IE8 on Windows 7 :-)
[09:15:34] <markelog> we specially enable this mode
[09:15:37] <m_gol> in IE8 mode
[09:15:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno what will happen there but again the reason it's like that is because you probably have OLD code and that won't be upgraded to jQuery 1.13 right?
[09:15:58] <m_gol> internal apps, the abyss...
[09:16:00] <DaveMethvin> it's probably on 1.4.2 or something
[09:16:37] <DaveMethvin> i dont have a problem saying, "If you have old code in your intranet, don't upgrade to 1.13"
[09:16:50] <markelog> sorry got disconnected for a sec
[09:16:51] <markelog> no
[09:16:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:17:03] <markelog> we do this because ie7 is faster then ie8
[09:17:04] <markelog> )
[09:17:07] <m_gol> LOL
[09:17:08] <DaveMethvin> WAT
[09:17:08] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: When translating code from PHP to Javascript it is easy to miss that JS use + and PHP use . as glue between strings.
[09:17:27] <markelog> yeah, we had tests and everything
[09:17:27] <m_gol> haha, that's a first :D
[09:17:29] <DaveMethvin> well definitely stay on 1.4.2 then
[09:17:32] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:17:49] <markelog> but i actually disagree with that assesment
[09:17:59] <markelog> we should use ie8 in ie8 mode
[09:18:06] <m_gol> you know what would be faster than IE8 in IE7 mode? IE11 in IE11 mode. :-)
[09:18:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:18:17] <DaveMethvin> m_gol has a point
[09:18:20] <markelog> tell this to those users )
[09:18:29] <m_gol> yeah, I know ;)
[09:18:56] <DaveMethvin> well we have intentionally created a long runway so I am sure we'll get "feedback" from people who have those special situations
[09:19:13] <markelog> maybe some others sites do the same thing, but i doubt it
[09:19:27] <markelog> yeah, right
[09:19:28] <DaveMethvin> the people who would count are the ones using IE6/7 (or IE8+ in IE7 mode) and need to upgrade to 1.13+ for some reason
[09:19:36] <m_gol> btw, that's the link about Opera Mini & JS: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mini-and-javascript/
[09:19:48] <markelog> we're doing blog post about it?
[09:19:52] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:20:05] <m_gol> markelog: there's a google doc open for comments :)
[09:20:24] <DaveMethvin> so that will let people know well in advance and also let us see if we are crazy and can't possibly do this :)
[09:20:47] <markelog> yeah, that's what i proposed )
[09:20:48] <DaveMethvin> but i would think 1.13 won't happen until 2015 and IE6/7 should be a pretty small share by then
[09:20:56] <markelog> if you recall )
[09:21:16] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R3MfxyGXJ3ydZOKoIMbe9cG6PvTHyBED50RCva8ozkU/edit
[09:21:25] <DaveMethvin> (team only)
[09:21:30] <markelog> it should be, otherwise we probably shouldn't help this to stay as is
[09:21:55] <DaveMethvin> right so if we are wrong somehow we have time to adjust
[09:22:28] <DaveMethvin> i just don't want to say "we're dropping IE6/7" a month or so before we ship 1.13
[09:23:01] <DaveMethvin> the downside is that people will look at current market share and try to infer what we should do in a year based on THAT rather than on market share in a year
[09:23:35] <DaveMethvin> anyway, let's wrap up this point, comments still welcome in that doc and i need to get with scott_gonzalez to finish it
[09:23:48] <DaveMethvin> next, the .data() API
[09:23:59] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we came to a conclusion on this and we should
[09:24:11] <gibson042> link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj5JJFjq9rZDdFpCNDZucDgwRVMtaHQyd1RVN0JFamc&usp=drive_web#gid=0
[09:24:11] <DaveMethvin> i'm becoming more chicken about what we should change
[09:24:13] <m_gol> did you look at the VOTE column? :)
[09:24:25] <m_gol> that looks like a conclusion ;)
[09:24:31] <DaveMethvin> VOTES WE DON"T NEED NO STINKIN VOTES
[09:25:08] <markelog> "You are a sick sick man, gibson042"
[09:25:08] <m_gol> Y U NO LIKE HTML5?
[09:25:09] <markelog> ))
[09:25:09] <b-ot> m_gol: (屮'Д')屮
[09:25:25] <DaveMethvin> i like it, just worried about the backcompat implications
[09:26:09] <gibson042> it will break `var iHaveJquerysInternalObject = $el.data( object ).data()`
[09:26:10] <DaveMethvin> the only one that worries me is .extend()ing keys into the data
[09:26:22] <DaveMethvin> that's not a typical HTML5 thing
[09:26:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:26:48] <DaveMethvin> what gibson042  said
[09:26:56] <DaveMethvin> what if we didn't do that?
[09:26:59] <DaveMethvin> but did the rest?
[09:27:12] <gibson042> but `$el.data( object ).data( key )` will work
[09:27:25] <DaveMethvin> yes i think it fixes everything else
[09:27:36] <DaveMethvin> and if we get data both ways it will still work
[09:27:54] <DaveMethvin> but always set camelized
[09:27:59] <DaveMethvin> and DON'T PUT BOTH in
[09:28:00] <gibson042> I think it is the only one to break that pattern
[09:28:15] <gibson042> but that *does* look like the pattern worth dropping
[09:28:32] <DaveMethvin> okay then i'm good with it too
[09:28:46] <DaveMethvin> btw gibson042 thanks for spelling all the alternatives out there
[09:28:49] <m_gol> any solution except "embrace HTML5" introduces concepts confusing to user
[09:28:55] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:29:02] <m_gol> the embracing option basically means "camelize everything"
[09:29:18] <m_gol> but seeing how .data(key, value) and .data({key: value}) work differently is confusing
[09:29:42] <gibson042> m_gol: but they only work differently if some tries to get our internal object
[09:30:05] <m_gol> right
[09:30:19] <DaveMethvin> the important thing is to document it
[09:30:31] <DaveMethvin> the .data() docs are kind of a mess
[09:31:07] <DaveMethvin> some of it i don't think we can "fix" because people will always confuse the purpose of .data() vs data- attrs
[09:31:24] <DaveMethvin> but i think we've wrapped that one up
[09:31:31] <DaveMethvin> sooo Bower
[09:31:48] <DaveMethvin> did i mention i regret ever hearing the name Bower?
[09:32:06] <m_gol> :)
[09:32:08] <DaveMethvin> and nobody tell scott_gonzalez he was right
[09:32:13] <DaveMethvin> NOBODY
[09:32:20] <m_gol> :)
[09:32:40] <m_gol> it's really bad there's no publishing to bower
[09:32:40] <DaveMethvin> i just wasn't sure what the specific problem was since the guy didn't spell it out in the ticket
[09:33:02] <m_gol> so pending+needinfo
[09:33:05] <DaveMethvin> but before i asked for clarification i thought i'd check with someone who might now
[09:33:10] <DaveMethvin> know*
[09:33:30] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll just ask on the ticket then
[09:33:40] <m_gol> what are bower module exports?
[09:34:06] <DaveMethvin> well that's why i am asking :)
[09:34:17] <m_gol> :)
[09:34:45] <DaveMethvin> on jQuery.trim() did we all agree that a trusty regex was the best cross-browser solution?
[09:34:52] <m_gol> +1
[09:34:58] <gibson042> +1
[09:35:02] <DaveMethvin> who wants to take that one?
[09:35:11] <m_gol> and we can add all Androids 4.0+ to hellspawn
[09:35:13] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if we have a ticket
[09:35:22] <m_gol> I think we don't
[09:35:27] <DaveMethvin> it's all in the pull i think
[09:35:29] <DaveMethvin> we should have a ticket
[09:35:33] <markelog> sorry, gotta go
[09:35:42] <m_gol> well, I changed it to match 1.x so I might as well change it to the final solution :)
[09:35:51] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks m_gol !
[09:36:08] <m_gol> I'll create a ticket
[09:36:24] <DaveMethvin> alright, we're moving now
[09:36:39] <m_gol> actually, there's a ticket
[09:36:40] <m_gol> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14794
[09:36:56] <m_gol> I just forgot to add the "Fixes" section to commit msg
[09:37:04] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[09:37:22] <DaveMethvin> that link has the trac tickets for the next patch release, not too many and they mostly seem easy
[09:37:54] <DaveMethvin> left out the owner field
[09:39:04] <DaveMethvin> if any of you have some time, feel free to grab one and fix it, i think they all are pretty simple
[09:39:09] <DaveMethvin> except this one http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14836
[09:39:16] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked into what's going on there
[09:39:41] <DaveMethvin> it's kind of a strange situation because the css property is prefixed, but so is one of the values
[09:40:05] <DaveMethvin> i just haven't run thru it in the debugger to see what's being set
[09:40:11] <m_gol> well, we don't prefix values
[09:40:17] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:40:23] <m_gol> it would be hard to do and we'd have to explicitely whitelist properties we parse
[09:40:36] <DaveMethvin> but since they gave us an explicit prop with prefix we should have set it
[09:40:54] <m_gol> ah, we don't?
[09:41:00] <DaveMethvin> i dunno :)
[09:41:19] <DaveMethvin> i didn't debug it but whatever we do it doesn't work :)
[09:41:40] <DaveMethvin> the fact that "all" works may be a clue
[09:41:42] <m_gol> yeah, ok, sth should have gotten set there
[09:43:04] <DaveMethvin> i may have missed a few simple bugs in the open tix but i think most of the other ones are breaking or big changes that can wait for 1.12  and 2.2
[09:43:36] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 if you want to land you squashed code we should do that asap before trying to patch all these things
[09:44:03] <gibson042> ok, I think the only open issue was my minification hint comments
[09:44:13] <m_gol> there's this Android 2.3 cross-document appending but I'll need to check it before we decide sth
[09:44:51] <DaveMethvin> and yeah i got it ... it would be good to have some place that documents that
[09:45:06] <gibson042> what about http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.11%2F2.1&milestone=1.11&milestone=2.1&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=component&order=priority ?
[09:45:21] <gibson042> 1.11/2.1 tickets for which we never updated the milestone
[09:45:36] <DaveMethvin> both look like they could be fixed in the patch, i agree
[09:45:41] <DaveMethvin> let me move them over
[09:46:10] <m_gol> I have one more thing
[09:46:27] <DaveMethvin> fire away
[09:46:56] <m_gol> does anyone know why the boxSizing support test doesn't just do support.boxSizing = document.createElement('div').style.boxSizing === ''?
[09:47:37] <m_gol> current way of testing required this ugly patch to workaround the WebKit zooming patch, it requires body etc.
[09:47:51] <m_gol> and from our support tables only IE6/7 fail this anyway
[09:48:02] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov may know
[09:48:05] <m_gol> but it seems obvious this test was done this way on purpose
[09:48:19] <m_gol> maybe some older WebKit/Gecko versions were buggy?
[09:48:29] <DaveMethvin> could have been
[09:48:36] <m_gol> bc I'd love to simplify this test if that's the case
[09:48:45] <DaveMethvin> seems like we should be past that, i'd hope
[09:49:07] <DaveMethvin> check with mikesherov or heck, just see what breaks in the browser tests
[09:49:14] <m_gol> I'll check Android, you never know ;)
[09:49:25] <DaveMethvin> grrr
[09:49:52] <DaveMethvin> so i have to run in a sec
[09:50:09] <DaveMethvin> does it seem like these patches could be done by March 20? I'd like to get a beta out
[09:50:19] <DaveMethvin> so we can get 1.12 / 2.2 underway
[09:50:54] <DaveMethvin> i think i have time to do some of these in the next week
[09:50:57] <m_gol> seems fine
[09:51:05] <DaveMethvin> but there are a few i'll need help with probably
[09:51:17] <DaveMethvin> i'll just come and bug some of you :)
[09:51:25] <m_gol> :)
[09:52:03] <gibson042> I think March 20 is possible
[09:52:11] <DaveMethvin> ok gotta run ... thanks guys
