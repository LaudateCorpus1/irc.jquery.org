[08:58:36] <DaveMethvin> creeek
[09:02:31] <DaveMethvin> hellooooo
[09:02:38] <DaveMethvin> lemme see here
[09:02:51] <DaveMethvin> who's around?
[09:03:02] <gibson042> yo
[09:03:26] <DaveMethvin> nice work on that cleanup gibson042
[09:03:37] <DaveMethvin> where DO you find those bytes?
[09:03:52] <gibson042> I always keep some under the mattress for a rainy day
[09:03:57] <DaveMethvin> are you using smaller semicolons or something?
[09:04:29] <DaveMethvin> let's give ppl a few more minutes to filter in
[09:05:11] <gibson042> and ritual offerings to the Lempel/Ziv/Welch trinity
[09:06:57] <gibson042> I think the changes in checked state for event handlers deserve a mention in the upgrade guide, but I'm not sure how to word it
[09:07:11] <gibson042> focus/blur ordering as well
[09:07:27] <DaveMethvin> agreed, lemme add that
[09:08:49] <DaveMethvin> if i knew docs would be this much of a pain i wouldn't have changed anything :D
[09:09:15] <mikesherov> brb
[09:09:25] <DaveMethvin> didn't know he was here!
[09:10:01] <DaveMethvin> OMG IT'S CYBER MONDAY, LET THE SPAMMERS REJOICE!
[09:10:50] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 i think you should land those changes whenever you're ready, and jaubourg is landing his unit test rewrite soon
[09:11:28] <gibson042> yup
[09:11:35] <gibson042> I'll land after http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1591 gives me a green light
[09:11:41] <DaveMethvin> i'm hoping mergeatron will be ready soon, without a way to test i am feeling like i feel when i leave my cell phone at home
[09:12:01] <gibson042> amen, brother
[09:12:30] <gibson042> so I think we should have a jshint scavenger hunt at one of the events ;)
[09:13:06] <DaveMethvin> how would that work?
[09:13:27] <gibson042> who the hell knows; I just want a handle on all these damn options
[09:13:35] <DaveMethvin> well that's fer sure
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> every time i read those docs it's sprouted a couple more
[09:13:57] <DaveMethvin> btw how is your availability in december?
[09:14:19] <gibson042> pretty much the same as now; no major obstacles
[09:14:39] <DaveMethvin> ok, just trying to figure out who might be off on vacations or whatever
[09:15:06] <DaveMethvin> well gibson042 it may just be you and me ... take a look at the agenda
[09:15:32] <DaveMethvin> does it seem like we can get most of the 1.9 stuff buttoned up in hte next couple of weeks?
[09:15:41] <timmywil> ahhh
[09:15:45] <DaveMethvin> aha!
[09:15:57] <DaveMethvin> same q for you timmywil :)
[09:16:13] <DaveMethvin> anything you guys need to finish for 1.9 in sizzle?
[09:16:32] <timmywil> yea, we've got some selectors to finish up
[09:16:39] <gibson042> expanding selector support maybe
[09:16:57] <DaveMethvin> okay and that's pre-split work I suspect
[09:16:58] <gibson042> 1.9 seems like a good time to go all CSS3
[09:17:03] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: speaking of, that bug you posted…should we fix that?
[09:17:23] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: probably, i just added some code that expects it to work :)
[09:17:23] <timmywil> gibson042: that's what we have scheduled
[09:18:01] <DaveMethvin> you'd only need to do a .closest("fieldset") style look if the current element had a Boolean disabled property that was false
[09:18:30] <timmywil> I think there are other cases that make an input disabled as well
[09:18:37] <timmywil> like maybe form[disabled]
[09:18:45] <DaveMethvin> orly?
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> well
[09:18:54] <DaveMethvin> whatever the spec says
[09:19:07] <DaveMethvin> kind of a pain
[09:19:22] <DaveMethvin> it's not a critical item tho
[09:19:34] <timmywil> it is also language-dependent
[09:19:34] <DaveMethvin> and since it's outside the jQuery repo it doesn't have to be finished before the split
[09:19:40] <timmywil> xml != html
[09:20:11] <DaveMethvin> altho the check for the .disabled property being Boolean would take care of that, no?
[09:20:46] <timmywil> I don't think a fieldset would have an effect on it's inputs if the document is XML, although that's quite an edge case
[09:20:58] <DaveMethvin> wow
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> that would be ugly
[09:21:31] <DaveMethvin> so mainly i just want to be sure all the removals are done and we have 1.9 ready for an early test
[09:21:53] <DaveMethvin> including the compat plugin so ppl can know what is broken in their code and why
[09:22:11] <DaveMethvin> i still have to get the ajax global evnets change moved to the compat plugin
[09:22:20] <DaveMethvin> waiting on jaubourg to land his unit test changes
[09:22:30] <timmywil> I'm pretty sure Sizzle would be the only engine that respects parents(fieldset or otherwise) being disabled for inputs, but I want to research more
[09:22:40] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:22:53] <DaveMethvin> i doubt it's encountered very frequently
[09:23:04] <timmywil> yea
[09:23:32] <DaveMethvin> and in 2.0 even less frequent since qSA will usually take care of it
[09:23:39] <timmywil> ah here it is http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/links.html#disabled-elements
[09:23:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: true
[09:24:19] <DaveMethvin> the room spins: li elements that are children of menu elements, and that have a child element that defines a command, if the first such element's Disabled State facet is true (disabled)
[09:24:30] <timmywil> LOL "and is not a descendant of that fieldset element's first legend element child, if any."
[09:25:04] <gibson042> good grief
[09:25:08] <timmywil> optgroups too
[09:25:37] <timmywil> anyway
[09:26:21] <DaveMethvin> let's look at the open tix ... btw we're down to only about 100 now
[09:26:36] <DaveMethvin> unassigned first
[09:27:04] <DaveMethvin> i have a pull for 9885, again stacked behind the ajax test rewrite
[09:27:11] <timmywil> I want to get in :lang(), :link, :target, and :root. gibson042 has a ticket for *-of-type and :nth-last-child
[09:27:25] <DaveMethvin> grabbed that ticket
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> there's a pull for 12004, and i told him i'd help so i'll that that one
[09:28:11] <DaveMethvin> TRAC TOO SLOW
[09:28:38] <timmywil> I'm still redirecting for some reason
[09:28:51] <DaveMethvin> because TRAC TOO SLOW
[09:29:15] <DaveMethvin> it would be faster for me to send a screen shot
[09:29:30] <timmywil> ah, got there
[09:29:55] <DaveMethvin> 12838 i was thinking...isn't that really just jQuery.getScriptSync??
[09:30:49] <mikesherov> I'm here
[09:30:55] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[09:31:08] <gibson042> DaveMethvin yeah
[09:31:35] <DaveMethvin> i know we don't LIKE sync script execution but we might as well call it what it is if we're making a hook for it
[09:32:02] <gibson042> I expect lots of bikeshedding on the name in the PR for that ticket
[09:32:08] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah
[09:32:14] <timmywil> I'll grab ?12885
[09:32:17] <DaveMethvin> getScriptTheBadWay
[09:32:22] <DaveMethvin> ok timmywil
[09:32:25] <timmywil> ?12885
[09:32:26] <bot-t> [#12885] Optimize jQuery.expr.filters.hidden (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/12885
[09:32:32] <timmywil> and do a perf
[09:32:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah i would have landed it as is except for the perf question
[09:32:55] <DaveMethvin> i think it should be better the new way
[09:33:05] <DaveMethvin> but what i think isn't always right :D
[09:33:23] <DaveMethvin> let's backtrack for a sec ... mikesherov anything we should know about mergeatron progress?
[09:33:26] <timmywil> ditto
[09:33:32] <mikesherov> yes
[09:33:41] <mikesherov> so, we got mergeatron up and running on Saturday
[09:33:45] <DaveMethvin> YAY
[09:33:46] <gibson042> it's freaking awesome
[09:33:56] <mikesherov> so, it's OK
[09:33:57] <gibson042> big kudos to all who are working on it
[09:34:01] <mikesherov> thanks
[09:34:05] <mikesherov> it's got bugs
[09:34:09] <DaveMethvin> NO
[09:34:13] <mikesherov> obviously, it was built for SNAP's use case
[09:34:14] <timmywil> what are bugs?
[09:34:16] <mikesherov> and works great
[09:34:23] <mikesherov> but for jQuery, it no work
[09:34:26] <timmywil> I don't understand this word
[09:34:29] <mikesherov> so I am debugging
[09:34:31] <mikesherov> with gnarf
[09:34:38] <mikesherov> we already addresses like 6 bugs
[09:34:41] <DaveMethvin> are you saying mergeatron saw our code and ran away?
[09:34:49] <DaveMethvin> WHO DEALT THIS MESS?
[09:34:52] <mikesherov> it saw jaubourg's unit test overhaul and died
[09:34:58] <mikesherov> literally
[09:35:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah THAT's a diff
[09:35:03] <mikesherov> it was like, fuck that
[09:35:16] <DaveMethvin> no one expects the suppressed diff
[09:35:27] <mikesherov> yup, surpressed diff killed it
[09:35:31] <mikesherov> so worked around that
[09:35:42] <mikesherov> and now it's got a synchronization issue
[09:35:43] <DaveMethvin> so any thougts about when it might be in fighting shape?
[09:35:45] <timmywil> alright, hate to be here for only 20min. Need to run. I'll dig into code this week.
[09:35:52] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks timmywil
[09:35:59] <mikesherov> I'm hacking on it on Friday some more
[09:36:12] <mikesherov> and also going to work with steves on it in a few minutes
[09:36:36] <mikesherov> the main problem now is that it just needs a lot more logging so I know where the issue is
[09:36:44] <mikesherov> Hopefully, by next Monday
[09:36:47] <DaveMethvin> ok ... per the agenda/notes i'm really hoping we can get a 1.9 beta out on dec 9
[09:36:57] <DaveMethvin> and i'll see you in nyc next week?
[09:37:01] <mikesherov> Yes!
[09:37:03] <mikesherov> So, can I talk about my stuff here
[09:37:11] <mikesherov> I have the css array signature
[09:37:41] <mikesherov> I'm thinking of adding a bit of magic too… if you use array notation, certain shorthands can work…
[09:38:18] <mikesherov> sorry, I meant certain non array shorthands can work:
[09:38:31] <mikesherov> $('#elem').css('border*Width');
[09:38:34] <mikesherov> thoughts?
[09:38:36] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[09:38:53] <DaveMethvin> depends on the bytes
[09:38:58] <DaveMethvin> would definitely be useful
[09:39:02] <mikesherov> I mean, regardless of bytes
[09:39:19] <mikesherov> it would be insansely useful in UI
[09:39:22] <mikesherov> insanely*
[09:39:48] <DaveMethvin> thing about UI is that they have to old cores into eternity
[09:39:59] <DaveMethvin> but sometime in 2020 they'll be able to use what we put in 1.9
[09:40:04] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:40:10] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: sure, they still have 1.6.4
[09:40:10] <gibson042> that's a bit too magical for me
[09:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> We still have 1.6.0...
[09:40:35] <mikesherov> gibson, how about $('#elem').css(['borderWidth'])
[09:40:38] <DaveMethvin> i've needed it before
[09:40:44] <gibson042> maybe `$elem.css( $.css.borderWidths )` or something though
[09:41:03] <mikesherov> gibson, that works too
[09:41:07] <DaveMethvin> so borderWidth would return [ top, right, bottom, left ]
[09:41:22] <DaveMethvin> or whatever magic word
[09:41:23] <mikesherov> the reason I bring it up is because of getWidthOrHeight
[09:41:26] <mikesherov> in dimensions
[09:42:28] <mikesherov> and lastly, I want to add the ability (only on the static, non-documented internal) to pass in a CSSStyleDeclaration to work off of
[09:42:30] <gibson042> there's huge value in making it easy to get all directional properties, I just don't want to lock us in to a particular syntax/approach so early on
[09:42:51] <mikesherov> so that you can retrieve multiple normalized styles from the object
[09:43:16] <mikesherov> style = getStyle(); $.css(elem, prop, style)
[09:43:20] <DaveMethvin> which you'll need if  you want to return they array of stuff efficiently
[09:43:31] <mikesherov> well, right, I need it for that
[09:44:23] <DaveMethvin> sounds like you have that one under control ... can you get it done in the next couple of weeks?
[09:44:36] <mikesherov> So, I was going to ask if we can document a third parameter to $('elem').css… one that does parseFloat automatically
[09:44:39] <mikesherov> yes, I will
[09:44:42] <DaveMethvin> it's one of our few major feature additions
[09:44:44] <mikesherov> sorry, too much detail :-)
[09:44:57] <mikesherov> I was backed up with UI pull queue, and then mergeatron
[09:45:04] <mikesherov> next couple of weeks are core time
[09:45:08] <DaveMethvin> all sounds good
[09:45:17] <mikesherov> Plus I was trying to stay out of gibson042 and orkel's way!
[09:45:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah tell that mean scott_gonzalez to go away!
[09:45:36] <gibson042> lol
[09:45:50] <DaveMethvin> i need to dig back into the orkel pulls
[09:46:12] <DaveMethvin> they seem to be on the right track but sometimes he makes changes i don't understand
[09:46:23] <DaveMethvin> which may just be because i'm not very understanding
[09:46:27] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[09:46:34] <DaveMethvin> but in general they are right
[09:46:36] <gibson042> no, I get the same impression a lot
[09:46:45] <DaveMethvin> some of it seems to be a language barrier
[09:46:52] <gibson042> he's frequently right for non-obvious reasons
[09:46:57] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah
[09:47:07] <DaveMethvin> some more comments would help
[09:47:16] <DaveMethvin> and i can add them once i understand what the  heck is going on
[09:48:19] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 iff you have some extra time i was looking for stuff you might take
[09:48:26] <DaveMethvin> since you don't have any assigned tix
[09:48:35] <DaveMethvin> a lot of the open stuff is oldIE
[09:48:41] <gibson042> I was thinking about removing the last of our undocumented private parameters
[09:48:48] <DaveMethvin> ah, yes
[09:48:53] <gibson042> we got started at the summit, but there's still some more
[09:49:02] <DaveMethvin> agreed, and there's no ticket for that
[09:49:18] <DaveMethvin> i created that generic one but we renamed it and closed it
[09:49:27] <DaveMethvin> for the .data() case
[09:49:42] <mikesherov> gibson042: .css() comes to mind
[09:49:46] <gibson042> yeah, see ?12519 seems like it was prematurely closed
[09:49:47] <bot-t> yeah, [#12519] Public API methods should not have private arguments (closed bug: fixed in v1.9) - http://jqbug.com/12519
[09:50:07] <DaveMethvin> agreed, that is the one i was thinking of
[09:50:18] <DaveMethvin> really should have been separate tickets or all addressed at once
[09:51:10] <DaveMethvin> that failure on HEAD requests was a browserstack issue wasn't it? it got fixed but must have re-broken
[09:52:32] <DaveMethvin> perhaps docs#12600 gibson042?
[09:52:33] <bot-t> [#12600]  ( then:) - http://jqbug.com/12600
[09:52:54] <DaveMethvin> dunno where that description came from...
[09:53:26] <gibson042> sure
[09:53:39] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron is owner right now
[09:54:10] <gibson042> I'll talk with him later, but am likely to take it
[09:54:20] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[09:54:36] <DaveMethvin> alright, i think that's about it
[09:54:49] <DaveMethvin> this looks like we may be able to pull off 1.9
[09:54:57] <DaveMethvin> looking pretty decent right now
[09:55:14] <DaveMethvin> i definitely want to get the docs all polished up
[09:55:37] <DaveMethvin> and make sure the compat plugin whispers the right hints so people can know what to fix
[09:55:46] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys!
[09:56:56] <gibson042> see you in -dev
