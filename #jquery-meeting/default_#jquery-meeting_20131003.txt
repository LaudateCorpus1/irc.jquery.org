[11:00:17] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:02:05] <arschmitz> Ahoy
[11:02:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hey Alex
[11:03:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like it is just you and me
[11:04:02] <arschmitz> guess so
[11:04:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin informed me that he couldn't make it
[11:04:41] <uGoMobi> didn't hear from the others
[11:05:08] <arschmitz> ok
[11:05:54] <arschmitz> well 1.4 RC
[11:06:16] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:06:22] <uGoMobi> agenda and updates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e1u7NMP9hyQeiVsSp0Rn9OIpD72XSlBZ_YeQJRgc6QA/edit#
[11:07:16] <uGoMobi> not that many open tickets left
[11:07:32] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6500
[11:07:32] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6500 by googol7 (1w 3d ago): iOS 7 homescreen app redirects to other page when widget gets input focus
[11:07:34] <arschmitz> yeah iv been concentrating on fixing bugs
[11:07:41] <uGoMobi> nice!
[11:08:04] <uGoMobi> close that one as won't fix since it will also happen without jQuery Mobile?
[11:08:29] <uGoMobi> and I can't think of anything we can do about it
[11:08:46] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[11:08:54] <arschmitz> just dont know what we could do
[11:09:41] <uGoMobi> can people work around it?
[11:09:52] <arschmitz> im not sure
[11:10:00] <arschmitz> one thing i want to look into with it
[11:10:10] <arschmitz> is shouldnt the toolbar hide when the select gets focus?
[11:10:23] <uGoMobi> yeah we have that option
[11:10:27] <arschmitz> it does not seem to in 1.3 or 1.4
[11:10:32] <arschmitz> and i thought it was the default
[11:10:40] <arschmitz> so i need to check that
[11:10:56] <arschmitz> but i think it might be inputs only not selects
[11:11:59] <uGoMobi> yeah, just checked
[11:12:04] <uGoMobi> select doesn't have that option
[11:12:23] <arschmitz> ok so maybe we should add it?
[11:12:32] <arschmitz> then they can work around it that way?
[11:12:44] <uGoMobi> hmm don't see it in textinput either
[11:12:54] <uGoMobi> is it an option in fixedToolbar?
[11:13:11] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L22
[11:13:12] <arschmitz> yes its just a selector in there
[11:13:13] <uGoMobi> it is
[11:13:23] <uGoMobi> so that should still work
[11:13:26] <arschmitz> ok so it should hide on fouce
[11:13:29] <arschmitz> focus
[11:14:24] <uGoMobi> ok let's test that
[11:14:44] <uGoMobi> I have been looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6349
[11:14:44] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6349 by uGoMobi (1mon 2w ago): Panel: Page contents disappear when opening a panel on WP8
[11:14:46] <agcolom> sorry was on the phone with my parents... and having dinner....
[11:14:53] <uGoMobi> hey agcolom
[11:15:19] <agcolom> hey :-)
[11:15:52] <uGoMobi> so I have been looking into that WP8 issue
[11:16:08] <uGoMobi> and can also reproduce without jQuery Mobile
[11:16:13] <arschmitz> hows that 8X working for you?
[11:16:24] <uGoMobi> and can't think of anything that would fix this
[11:16:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh is that the flying away one
[11:16:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it works
[11:16:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[11:16:55] <arschmitz> that one is crazy
[11:17:23] <uGoMobi> if you transition a transform WP8 applies the translate-x again at end of the transition
[11:17:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is there any sort of work around for it?
[11:17:52] <uGoMobi> I tried a lot, but no dice
[11:18:03] <uGoMobi> and can't find anyting on the web about this bug
[11:18:06] <arschmitz> bummer
[11:18:18] <arschmitz> i remember finding other people complaining about it
[11:18:21] <arschmitz> but no fix
[11:19:25] <uGoMobi> will leave the ticket open for now in case I think of something but we probably can't fix this for the 1.4 RC/final release
[11:19:45] <uGoMobi> then we have to add a note in the docs about it
[11:20:33] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:20:33] <uGoMobi> API docs... Gabriel updated a lot of things already
[11:20:48] <arschmitz> yeah those seem to be coming along awesome
[11:20:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you have time to work on API docs?
[11:21:22] <uGoMobi> this ticket maybe https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/82
[11:21:23] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #82 by uGoMobi (11mon 1d ago): Combine header and footer entries: toolbar widget
[11:22:43] <uGoMobi> I combined header and footer in the demos and updated the toolbar pages there
[11:23:07] <uGoMobi> the demos are getting in shape too
[11:23:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we have to look into the custom JS there
[11:23:35] <uGoMobi> maybe you can work a bit on that
[11:23:39] <arschmitz> sure
[11:24:00] <uGoMobi> we can discuss on -dev what we do exactly with the navmenu
[11:24:10] <arschmitz> ok
[11:24:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin updated the Download Builder to 1.4 beta 1 but that didn't work
[11:24:51] <uGoMobi> I noticed 1.4 alpha 1 didn't work either
[11:25:30] <uGoMobi> gseguin doesn't have much time at the moment so it might be good someone else know how to update the builder too
[11:26:16] <arschmitz> I can try and look at it have not really done anything with it before
[11:26:48] <uGoMobi> great, thanks
[11:27:14] <uGoMobi> I will work on the ThemeRoller update next week
[11:28:33] <uGoMobi> I will talk with RWhitbeck and agcolom about the new web site
[11:28:49] <uGoMobi> haven't been able to get in touch with RWhitbeck
[11:29:14] <uGoMobi> not sure if he is working on it
[11:29:35] <uGoMobi> if not I will work on it after ThemeRoller update
[11:29:56] <uGoMobi> so it looks like we need at least 2 more weeks to get things in shape
[11:30:46] <agcolom> RWhitbeck is in Lisbon
[11:30:59] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[11:34:27] <uGoMobi> let's decide when we release RC1 during next week meeting
[11:34:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you think ^^ ?
[11:35:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you had mentioned wednesday before
[11:35:08] <arschmitz> im fine with that
[11:36:46] <uGoMobi> yeah, I know
[11:37:15] <arschmitz> oh sorry durring meeting missed that part
[11:37:16] <arschmitz> lol
[11:37:18] <uGoMobi> but since we need at least two more weeks for final we might want to stay on beta a bit longer
[11:37:27] <arschmitz> yes im fine with that too
[11:37:51] <arschmitz> yeah sounds good to me
[11:38:29] <uGoMobi> let's try to have the open tickets fixed by the end of next week
[11:38:53] <uGoMobi> the problem is more all other things we have to do before final
[11:39:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you have time to work on things?
[11:39:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh thats right

[11:43:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i missed that
[11:44:23] <toddmparker> (lurking)
[11:44:35] <arschmitz> .ui-panel is fine there
[11:44:40] <agcolom> hey toddmparker :-)
[11:44:48] <arschmitz> because this is part of destroy
[11:45:03] <arschmitz> so all panels are enhanced at this point for sure
[11:45:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, but it is the check for other panels
[11:45:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and thats a much faster selector
[11:45:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes thats fine it should be .ui-panel
[11:46:06] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:46:10] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker
