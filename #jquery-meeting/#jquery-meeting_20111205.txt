[09:01:07] <jaubourg> hey
[09:01:16] <gnarf> hallo
[09:01:44] <addyosmani_> hai
[09:01:55] <sindresorhus> Hi
[09:02:12] <DaveMethvin> heidy ho
[09:02:27] <gnarf> rwaldron and ajpiano are apparently away for this meeting
[09:02:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just saw that
[09:02:45] <jaubourg> yeah,saw that in -dev too
[09:03:05] <DaveMethvin> so I vote that whatever we decide to work on, we assign it to ajpiano and rwaldron then
[09:03:22] <jaubourg> +1 Dave
[09:03:23] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:03:28] <jaubourg> and lol
[09:03:34] <DaveMethvin> see its working already
[09:03:35] <danheberden> since ajpiano isn't here to vote for himself, i'll +1 for him
[09:04:15] <DaveMethvin> sounds like timmywil is out too
[09:04:34] <DaveMethvin> prolly busy at his new job!
[09:04:53] <DaveMethvin> i think this is a pretty light meeting anyway
[09:05:03] <DaveMethvin> i have the agenda updated
[09:05:57] <DaveMethvin> so jaubourg ... good to hear from you btw ... whatsup with that memory leak thing? People are swearing they have to null out the handler on the xhr
[09:06:35] <gnarf> i suppose i need to submit my suggestion to rewrite effects.js ? :)
[09:06:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah if there is no ticket
[09:06:54] <DaveMethvin> we can all vote it down that way :P
[09:07:23] <DaveMethvin> i think we are in good shape as far as 1.7 goes, just a few straggler bugs
[09:07:32] <DaveMethvin> for 1.8 we just closed the suggestion box
[09:07:39] <DaveMethvin> well actually it's still open but the deadline was today
[09:08:06] <DaveMethvin> so you may want to go through there for ideas we can discuss for 1.8
[09:08:38] <DaveMethvin> we can start voting for those features next week once all the suggestions are there
[09:08:59] <DaveMethvin> i mean, you can jump on it now if you want as well, just remember the high-water ticket so you won't miss any
[09:09:28] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I find it strange given I specifically = undefined the transport internally
[09:10:12] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg i didn't test to see if it really did fix a leak but it may be worth checking since there are mltiple reports
[09:10:21] <DaveMethvin> i pinged the closure compiler guys and they are working on changes as we speak for that part
[09:10:28] <DaveMethvin> i dunno what their timeline is tho
[09:11:01] <DaveMethvin> i have been really busy catching up on work so i haven't cleaned out the pull q but still want to do that
[09:11:14] <jaubourg> yeah, I'm cramping in work too
[09:11:22] <gnarf> my website is blowin up
[09:11:24] <DaveMethvin> maybe this week we can confab in -dev and discuss them?
[09:11:40] <jaubourg> sounds good
[09:11:50] <DaveMethvin> it would be good to land anything that needs to go in 1.7.2 asap so it can be tested for a while
[09:12:37] <jaubourg> but I didn't get the Closure reference... closure compiler guys making changes to fix memory leaks in ajax or did I mix everything up?
[09:13:00] <DaveMethvin> the cc stuff is general, they need to change their code so  they can
[09:13:08] <DaveMethvin> determine the stuff we do in defining methods with strings
[09:13:19] <jaubourg> oh
[09:13:36] <DaveMethvin> i thought we'd just annotate them
[09:13:46] <DaveMethvin> but they wanted to recognize them, not sure why
[09:14:01] <jaubourg> because the pattern will exists in plugins?
[09:14:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah perhaps
[09:14:25] <jaubourg> well, you all know what I think about this cc thingy anyway
[09:14:34] <DaveMethvin> rworth: what do you need from us on the docs repo?
[09:14:47] <jaubourg> oh yeah, doc repo... /me likes
[09:14:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[09:16:07] <jaubourg> ...
[09:16:12] <DaveMethvin> how does tomorrow look for a get-together in -dev for cleaning out the  pull queue
[09:16:13] <jaubourg> no Richard either
[09:16:23] <DaveMethvin> maybe around noonish?
[09:16:39] <jaubourg> sounds good, let me check my schedule
[09:16:41] <DaveMethvin> need to find out if rwaldron and timmywil can come
[09:16:50] <DaveMethvin> i'll propose that in the notes
[09:17:16] <jaubourg> I'll be able to attend for something like 2 hours
[09:17:21] <DaveMethvin> great!
[09:17:35] <DaveMethvin> any new stuff anybody wants to discuss?
[09:17:58] <DaveMethvin> gnarf can you come tomorrow and play?
[09:18:01] <jaubourg> how do we do for 1.8 proposals, we transfer them into tickets? Who's in charge of that?
[09:18:40] <DaveMethvin> if you see any that look good in the list, let me know ... i'll move those over
[09:18:50] <DaveMethvin> if you have new ideas, just create a ticket marked 1.8-discuss
[09:18:55] <jaubourg> ok
[09:19:02] <DaveMethvin> well, new ideas that aren't CRAZY! :P
[09:19:17] <DaveMethvin> i think you had one for Promises/A compliance on there?
[09:19:18] <jaubourg> I wanna rewrite events and... wait...
[09:19:20] <jaubourg> :P
[09:19:30] <jaubourg> yep, Promise/A compliance
[09:19:51] <DaveMethvin> that's a good one to discuss...i like the compliance but it will cause some confusion for existing code
[09:20:03] <DaveMethvin> but there's a growing set of compliant implementations
[09:20:08] <jaubourg> yes and no, only existing code that would chain after then
[09:20:18] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: tomorrow for pull queue?
[09:20:20] <jaubourg> ie $.Deferred().then(...).always(...)
[09:20:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: what time?
[09:20:31] <jaubourg> which is probably not that usual
[09:20:33] <DaveMethvin> noon?
[09:20:36] <DaveMethvin> noon-ish
[09:20:42] <DaveMethvin> really we should be discouraging use of the .done/.progress(), no?
[09:20:43] <jaubourg> same as meeting would be nice for me
[09:20:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: probably - ping me - i should be around
[09:20:48] <DaveMethvin> k
[09:21:17] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: on the contrary, they are far more performant
[09:21:30] <DaveMethvin> so they're adding to the existing promise?
[09:21:44] <jaubourg> if then === pipe in the future, it will get very heavy to use then
[09:21:50] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:22:02] <jaubourg> at least just to add callbacks
[09:22:12] <DaveMethvin> that's what i mean, so shoudl we also be pushing ppl to use .then() in most cases?
[09:22:16] <DaveMethvin> in the future?
[09:22:38] <danheberden> ?!
[09:23:01] <jaubourg> I'm torn on this one, because .then() is so non-performant (abd cannot be performant)
[09:23:14] <jaubourg> we should push for done/fail/progress imo
[09:23:32] <DaveMethvin> even if were Promise/A?
[09:23:44] * rworth is here now
[09:24:01] <jaubourg> yeah, being Promise/A just means our promises can be passed to code expecting Promise/A compliant implementation
[09:24:04] <jaubourg> that's all
[09:24:15] <danheberden> the done/fail api is so much more idiomatic then .then, imho
[09:24:31] <danheberden> *than .then
[09:24:32] <DaveMethvin> oh and .then is the only one that has to return a new promise?
[09:24:43] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: exactly
[09:24:44] <DaveMethvin> got it
[09:24:51] <DaveMethvin> now i see
[09:25:09] <DaveMethvin> so yeah it's less of a problem than i thought
[09:25:20] <jaubourg> you'd probably chain with done and fail: defer.done(...).fail(...) ... not so much with then: defer.then(...).then(...) ??
[09:25:28] <jaubourg> so return value of then is less of an issue
[09:25:40] <jaubourg> imho
[09:26:01] <DaveMethvin> i have some use cases for chained .then (.pipe)
[09:26:08] <jaubourg> thing is we have the Promise/A then... we just called it pipe :P
[09:26:18] <DaveMethvin> but yeah if we offer both we give the best of both worlds
[09:26:41] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg if there's not a ticket for that can you create one?
[09:26:51] <jaubourg> we could have current then => 'attach" or something... current pipe => "then" and keep pipe in for backward compat
[09:27:13] <DaveMethvin> rworth: so what do you need for the jquery-docs stuff?
[09:27:28] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: ditto
[09:27:32] <rworth> I think I'm good now. We got consensus via email to create a new repo
[09:27:37] <rworth> I'll create api.jquery.com repo
[09:27:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and it's a great idea
[09:27:50] <danheberden> rworth actually
[09:27:54] <rworth> I'll get with Karl about history, I think it'd be cool to import at least WordPress history into it
[09:28:01] <danheberden> is the _site_ going to be there or just the content?
[09:28:20] <DaveMethvin> wow that was scary, i came back to irc and accidentally clicked on the #jquery tab
[09:28:25] <danheberden> like - if the site (theme, blah blah blah) is going to be api.jquery.com or a subdir of the wordpress repo
[09:28:27] <DaveMethvin> i thought the meeting had really gone downhill
[09:28:31] <danheberden> "jquery-docs" might be better?
[09:28:42] <rworth> danheberden: api.jquery.com will just contain the xml files
[09:28:50] <rworth> the theme is in web-base-template
[09:28:51] <danheberden> DaveMethvin how can i add clicks to my buttons to ajax submit my form to google?
[09:28:59] <rworth> that's pretty much how all sites will be
[09:29:03] <DaveMethvin> GAAAAH
[09:29:13] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: jqueyr not worsks
[09:29:14] <danheberden> rworth ah, good point
[09:29:24] <danheberden> cary on then, fine sir
[09:29:27] <rworth> :)
[09:29:34] <danheberden> and by fine, i mean HAWT
[09:29:43] <rworth> youknowit
[09:29:47] <jaubourg> xml doc in repo = win
[09:29:55] <jaubourg> just saying
[09:30:00] <rworth> +1
[09:30:11] <DaveMethvin> and being able to checkpoint docs by version is a win too
[09:30:37] <DaveMethvin> sokay then, anythin else?
[09:31:07] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron is going to rewrite the docs site, and ajpiano will do all the 1.8 features
[09:31:36] <jaubourg> +1 Dave
[09:31:39] <rworth> ready, go
[09:31:51] <DaveMethvin> we'll check their progress next meeting
[09:32:08] <rworth> but the schedule has them being done tomorrow
[09:32:27] <DaveMethvin> they said they were in a cab, let's hope they have internets there
[09:32:40] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then, i have to run but will be back in -dev soon ... see yalll later!
[09:33:44] <jaubourg> \o/
