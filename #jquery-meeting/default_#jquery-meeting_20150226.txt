[09:00:36] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz jperrault jrossi2 scott_gonzalez snover
[09:00:44] <jperrault> o/
[09:00:51] <snover> yo
[09:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> So there was some pretty exciting news that we all saw this week.
[09:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> With PE reaching REC.
[09:01:38] <snover> which news was that? :)
[09:01:42] <snover> oh that news!
[09:01:58] <snover> yeah!
[09:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> There was lots of publicity around this. Resulted in a lot of people viewing PEP and starring the Chrome issue.
[09:03:26] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/270Q3J3V0v3X
[09:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> That's the traffic for the GitHub repo.
[09:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of that traffic came from the jQuery blog post.
[09:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://blog.jquery.com/2015/02/24/getting-on-point/
[09:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> A big chunk came from Ars Technica as well.
[09:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/pointer-events-finalized-but-apples-lack-of-support-still-a-deal-breaker/
[09:05:18] <arschmitz> Also twitter
[09:05:26] <arschmitz> lots and lots of links flying around on twitter
[09:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of links, but not lots of clicks.
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> At least not through t.co.
[09:06:44] <snover> that’s twitter for you
[09:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, everyone retweets, but nobody reads ;-)
[09:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> We did get some more people to chime in on the team issue from the blog post though.
[09:07:58] <arschmitz> yeah cgack from mobile expressed interest too
[09:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: How's the Intern PR update going?
[09:09:50] <jperrault> I have reviewed the latest comments, and expect to begin work on the proposed changes today.
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:42] <jperrault> is it worth merging the PR and doing the interface changes as a new issue?
[09:10:51] <scott_gonzalez> Would it help if snover implemented the changes?
[09:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really want to merge with essentially broken tests.
[09:11:29] <jperrault> understood.  clearly he has a firm grasp of what is needed, time is an issue for all of us :-)
[09:11:52] <jperrault> I'd like to take a stab at it
[09:12:00] <jperrault> he has offered his support as I need it
[09:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, do you think you can have this ready early next week?
[09:12:28] <jperrault> InterConnect has taken some time from me this week
[09:12:44] <jperrault> yes, I think that is reasonable
[09:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> I have a few other tasks to work on for othe projects, but I'll start working on the release script soon.
[09:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get a release out once we have CI set up.
[09:14:39] <arschmitz> +1
[09:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything they think we should focus on before getting out our first release?
[09:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> Besides CI and setting up gh-pages again.
[09:16:48] <arschmitz> so right now unless i missed some changes its still es5 only right
[09:17:07] <arschmitz> so will the first release be es5 only and we will work on making es3 for later release?
[09:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> Right, still ES5 only and we removed the hooks for external tools.
[09:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:17:36] <arschmitz> ok thats fine just wanted to clarify
[09:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted to wait for CI before making big changes.
[09:18:03] <arschmitz> yeah makes sense
[09:18:44] <arschmitz> and with es5 shim/sham it IS uesable in es3 as is
[09:18:51] <arschmitz> if people want to go that route
[09:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> snover: For testing in IE8, we'll need to load a different version of Intern, correct?
[09:19:37] <arschmitz> just need to polyfill the polyfill :-p
[09:21:40] <jperrault> do we need a different version of intern, or just list a different browser in the config?
[09:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> Intern is IE9+ for unit testing.
[09:24:12] <arschmitz> its intern-geezer as i recall
[09:24:34] <arschmitz> https://www.npmjs.com/package/intern-geezer
[09:24:55] <snover> for unit testing, yes, if the tests get updated to use functional tests instead then you can use regular intern with ie8
[09:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need to rewrite our tests though.
[09:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:25:12] <snover> to use -> to be
[09:25:44] <snover> none of these tests would have ever worked in ie8 because chai doesn’t support ie8
[09:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> right
[09:26:09] <snover> i still question the cost-benefit of supporting ie8 on this but i guess i am in the minority :)
[09:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault had actually done work to conver the tests to QUnit at one point.
[09:26:31] <jperrault> I think I still have that somewhere...
[09:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> But I believe there were legal issues with contributing to Polymer.
[09:26:41] <jperrault> at the time, yes.
[09:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's all I had for this week. Is there anything else anyone wants to discuss?
[09:28:24] <snover> does anyone want to take bets on where the chrome ticket will end up? it was at 29 when i went to bed last night
[09:29:24] <snover> it’s at 26 now
[09:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> Needs quite a few more stars to get really high though.
[09:29:50] <arschmitz> ill say 15
[09:30:04] <arschmitz> i dont think it will crack top 10 right off
[09:30:22] <arschmitz> its a long ways from top 10 still
[09:30:42] <snover> i’ll guess 13
[09:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> $1
[09:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's not how you play this game.
[09:32:10] <arschmitz> lol
[09:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go with 6. Let's see if we can get up to 2k stars...
[09:32:52] <arschmitz> that would be awesome
[09:32:59] <snover> ambitious! i like it.
[09:33:24] <arschmitz> just ovr double right now
[09:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, though even double would get it to 6.
[09:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, assuming the others don't increase...
[09:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think that's it for this week.
[09:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.

[10:59:32] <b-ot> arschmitz: agcolom, arschmitz, arthurvr, cgack, gabriel_schulhof, ianmaffett, jasperdegroot, sfrisk
[10:59:36] <arschmitz> Meeting time!
[10:59:38] <sfrisk> allo!
[10:59:50] <arthurvr> Hey
[11:00:18] <arschmitz> awww^^ guess he doesn't want to join us
[11:00:44] <cgack> heyo!
[11:01:02] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:01:15] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=693052
[11:02:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:02:33] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[11:03:19] <arschmitz> classes after reviewing the pr's submitted so far it seems there was some implementation confusion
[11:03:31] <arschmitz> so id just like to take a few minutes and address any questions anyone has
[11:04:22] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm good wrt. questions because of our discussion just prior to the meeting plus your review comments.
[11:04:36] <arschmitz> cgack: ?
[11:04:57] <cgack> yeah, I was just curious how we handle ui-button and theme .addClass()
[11:05:20] <cgack> are we to use _addClass( "ui-button" )
[11:05:38] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Actually, _addClass( targetElement, null, "ui-button" )
[11:05:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, arschmitz?
[11:05:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Lessee if I got this ...
[11:06:03] <arschmitz> correct
[11:06:09] <gabriel_schulhof> \o/
[11:06:20] <arschmitz> same with theme classes
[11:06:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Right ... do not resolve via class key, but do track.
[11:06:39] <arschmitz> ALL class additions or removals should go through new methods in widgets
[11:06:43] <cgack> interesting.. I must have missed that discussion. should be an easy once-over on toolbar then.  Thanks!
[11:07:19] <arschmitz> so if you do a search on the widgets there should not be any .addClasss .removeClass or .toggleClass calls any more
[11:07:34] <arschmitz> also incase this was missed
[11:08:06] <arschmitz> when your updating widgets you should also ( as seperate commits but same pr ) be updating all tests for that widget to use hasClasses and lacksClasses
[11:08:32] <cgack> cool, will do
[11:08:45] <arschmitz> so there should be no more calls in tests to .is( "., .attr( "class" or , .hasClass
[11:09:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I have a PR against qunit-assert-classes: https://github.com/arschmitz/qunit-assert-classes/pull/4
[11:09:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You need to reverse expected and actual.
[11:09:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i saw im doing some other updates and will land that at the same time
[11:09:45] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:10:06] <arschmitz> just trying to find time...
[11:10:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Tell me about it :)
[11:10:43] <arschmitz> also remember if your widget your reviewing uses icons
[11:10:48] <arschmitz> to update the code for those
[11:10:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep ... need to add spans.
[11:11:26] <gabriel_schulhof> I really, really, really, hope this isn't going to absolutely demolish listview performance.
[11:11:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its no different then it was in 1.3
[11:11:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Adding 350 right arrow spans on startup ...
[11:11:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but we had a good perf gain in 1.4.
[11:12:02] <arschmitz> not really
[11:12:04] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I guess, go with enhanced.
[11:12:22] <arschmitz> it turned out the most of the gains did not pan out in reality when they tested as i recal
[11:12:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, well then ...
[11:12:45] <arschmitz> dont have the results handy i would have to search my email
[11:13:11] <arschmitz> and yes listview does not worry me specificly also too much
[11:13:20] <arschmitz> because there are more significant optimizations
[11:13:33] <arschmitz> including not using the widget since it provides little value
[11:13:54] <arschmitz> if you are autogenerating your list like most big ones i would assume are
[11:14:23] <gabriel_schulhof> I've improved autodividers to work faster. Maybe we'll get something from that.
[11:14:33] <arschmitz> cool
[11:14:42] <arschmitz> sfrisk: anything on accordion?
[11:14:44] <gabriel_schulhof> It now reuses existing dividers.
[11:14:51] <gabriel_schulhof> ... when appropriate.
[11:14:59] <arschmitz> execlent sounds good
[11:15:01] <sfrisk> nope, not yet, I've been away on a business trip
[11:15:06] <arschmitz> ok
[11:15:44] <arschmitz> auto init
[11:16:37] <arschmitz> iv been trying to get this all passing on ui-1-12 but when i add there im getting weird seemingly unrelated test fails in things like collapsible
[11:16:42] <arschmitz> so im working on that
[11:17:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Module load order?
[11:17:13] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: RE: button --> looking into checkboxradio CSS again because things got broken in ui-1-12 branch
[11:17:34] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Yeah, checkboxradio looks kinda funky.
[11:17:44] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: the icon markup has completely changed
[11:17:52] <arschmitz> needs to be updated
[11:17:53] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:17:55] <gabriel_schulhof> The checkmark is off-center, and the place for it is absent when the input its unchecked.
[11:17:58] <jasperdegroot> will do that
[11:18:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[11:18:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah it just needs to be updated its not really broken just markup changed for icons
[11:18:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Looks much better though than before - which was exactly like native :)
[11:18:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Looking forward to it.
[11:18:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: icons are not longer positioned with absolute
[11:18:55] <arschmitz> they are inline
[11:19:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK. I just add the span, the classes, and I wipe my hands. They Just Work™
[11:19:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Thanks to jasperdegroot, right?
[11:20:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well you need to append / prepend to put them in the right place
[11:20:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, really? I thought we were going to stick to one of the two so as to allow the browser to do its RTL thing.
[11:20:49] <arschmitz> and there is a ui-icon-inline class i think i called it lol
[11:21:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: this isnt about rtl
[11:21:16] <arschmitz> its about where you want the icon left or right based on begining or end position option
[11:21:39] <arschmitz> so rtl is going to switch it where it should be this is not a factor
[11:21:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Aha, OK ...
[11:22:05] <arschmitz> old left === new begning === prepend
[11:22:15] <arschmitz> top is also prepend
[11:22:20] <arschmitz> bottom is append
[11:22:28] <jasperdegroot> how about the space span and rtl?
[11:22:37] <jasperdegroot> will it be at the "right" side?
[11:23:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Ha! So far, I've done it right, even with the search icon for the textinput, because I append, but it's the first child I add to the wrapper, and I append the input later, so in effect it ends up at the beginning.
[11:23:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Yaaaay!
[11:24:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: the space gets placed before or after the icon so it still works
[11:24:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: are you adding the space span though ?
[11:25:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Ummm ... no ... is that supposed to go inside the icon span, or is it supposed to succeed it?
[11:25:40] <gabriel_schulhof> So, like, [icon] [space] [input]?
[11:25:47] <arschmitz> ^^ that
[11:25:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[11:26:04] <gabriel_schulhof> So, just add a span with a space in it for good measure.
[11:26:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I can still do it all with append.
[11:26:32] <jasperdegroot> why don't we use :before/after to add the space?
[11:26:40] <gabriel_schulhof> I know, eh?
[11:27:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... is this not the same question as "why don't we use :before/after to add the icon"?
[11:27:09] <jasperdegroot> nope
[11:27:13] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:27:18] * gabriel_schulhof retreats, confused
[11:27:21] <arschmitz> there is a reason let me remember lol
[11:27:28] <jasperdegroot> ok :)
[11:27:44] <arschmitz> this took like 4 hours of discussion to come to this
[11:28:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... is a it a plain old space or a non-breaking space that I should be adding?
[11:29:02] <jasperdegroot> well, if you say it has been discussed but it was not a good option then it's fine
[11:29:47] <arschmitz> <span> </span>
[11:29:57] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i will get you that answer
[11:31:05] <arschmitz> that way you dont get a double space if you add it your self
[11:31:25] <jasperdegroot> I guess no one is fan of adding markup for this so I guess all alternatives have been investigated :)
[11:32:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ill get with you on that but moving on
[11:32:56] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:33:11] <arschmitz> we already covered qunit
[11:33:43] <arschmitz> no update on team pages but we dont want to forget this we should have it up before the other one goes away
[11:34:17] <arschmitz> and webiste grunt task
[11:34:28] <arschmitz> i finally published the webiste spider i have been working on to npm
[11:34:40] <arschmitz> it ended up its own command line tool with a seperate grunt wrapper
[11:35:05] <arschmitz> so over the next 2 weeks i will be adding a grunt task to all the websites
[11:35:30] <arschmitz> so any time anyone is bored and feels like running the test and fixing some links
[11:35:40] <arthurvr> awesome arschmitz! thanks!
[11:35:59] <arschmitz> arthurvr: im trying to tell everyone
[11:36:10] <arschmitz> there is a lot to fix when you get into the 3x stuff
[11:36:50] <arschmitz> thats everything i have for this week
[11:37:00] <arschmitz> does anyone else have anything?
[11:37:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Nope.
[11:37:50] <cgack> I'm good
[11:38:23] <jasperdegroot> nope
[11:38:27] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[11:38:42] <jasperdegroot> working on about page now (team section)
[11:38:51] <jasperdegroot> for jquerymobile.com
[11:38:53] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesome thank you
[11:39:00] <arschmitz> its pretty out dates
[11:39:02] <arschmitz> dated
[11:39:17] <jasperdegroot> yes it is
[11:47:15] <jasperdegroot> I guess we can turn off the lights
