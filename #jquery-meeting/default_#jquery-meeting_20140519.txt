[09:01:59] <DaveMethvin> who's here today?
[09:02:25] <gibson042> I'm hangin' on
[09:03:21] <DaveMethvin> okay, at least it's you and me
[09:03:28] <DaveMethvin> i see m_gol's cursor :)
[09:03:37] <m_gol> resent
[09:03:40] <m_gol> * present
[09:03:41] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: you around?
[09:03:44] <m_gol> cursor? :P
[09:03:51] <DaveMethvin> in the document notes
[09:03:55] <m_gol> ah
[09:03:59] <m_gol> I have it always open ;P
[09:04:10] <m_gol> one of the ~200 tabs :P
[09:04:17] <DaveMethvin> wow i thought i was bad
[09:04:20] <DaveMethvin> how do you find anything?
[09:05:13] <DaveMethvin> just putting together the notes
[09:05:36] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: any thoughts on that isNumeric bug?
[09:05:46] <gibson042> yes, and they're mostly violent :)
[09:05:49] <DaveMethvin> hah
[09:05:52] <DaveMethvin> i know the feeling
[09:05:52] <m_gol> I have 7 windows in 7 spaces
[09:06:01] <m_gol> each with about 20-30 tabs open ;)
[09:06:23] <m_gol> each space for a different topic - work, jQuery, Angular, etc. ;)
[09:06:26] <gibson042> looks like it's from loss of precision in a string cast for parseFloat
[09:06:58] <gibson042> so the fix will be almost certainly be replacing `obj - parseFloat( obj ) >= 0` with `!isNaN( obj - parseFloat( obj ) )`
[09:07:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah i figured
[09:07:16] <DaveMethvin> which is fine
[09:07:59] <DaveMethvin> what javascript really needs is a <=> operator :)
[09:08:25] <DaveMethvin> Perl has one
[09:08:35] <DaveMethvin> i don't know if that's an argument for or against tho
[09:08:38] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:08:39] <gibson042> lol
[09:09:40] <m_gol> we've started breaking on IE6/7 in the data module recently: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3032
[09:09:53] <m_gol> sometimes only 7, lol: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3011
[09:10:41] <DaveMethvin> what changed there recently?
[09:11:55] <DaveMethvin> nothing afaict
[09:12:01] <DaveMethvin> at least in acceptData
[09:12:29] <m_gol> the previous line with "data" in it is from Jan 16, 2013
[09:12:56] <m_gol> I got disconnected, so I'll repeat: the onpageshow IE issue was all that changed recently in 1.x data from what I can see
[09:13:34] <DaveMethvin> and that didn't do much
[09:14:41] <m_gol> the weird thing is nothing gets reported: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1854589
[09:15:47] <DaveMethvin> does it do the same on browserstack when testing manually?
[09:16:21] <m_gol> I'll need to check
[09:16:39] <DaveMethvin> checking now
[09:16:50] <m_gol> IE6 sometimes fails, IE7 always
[09:17:02] <DaveMethvin> damn browserstack you slow
[09:17:05] <m_gol> ;)
[09:17:16] <m_gol> IE7 on BrowserStack is slowness inception
[09:17:48] <DaveMethvin> oh gotta run 1.x i guess ... :)
[09:18:04] <m_gol> :D
[09:18:34] <m_gol> lol
[09:18:39] <m_gol> hangs on an alert
[09:18:45] <m_gol> about some ActiveX controls
[09:18:52] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i see that too
[09:18:59] <m_gol> so it seems BrowserStack messed sth up?
[09:19:32] <DaveMethvin> i guess
[09:19:38] <DaveMethvin> it's then saying Java is out of date
[09:19:43] <m_gol> what's the proper channel for us to report bugs to them?
[09:19:43] <DaveMethvin> WELL YEAH
[09:19:44] <m_gol> LOL
[09:19:55] <m_gol> well, you can't use jQuery without Java ;P
[09:20:14] <m_gol> (...Script)
[09:20:17] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe the unit tests pull in Java to check acceptData?
[09:20:30] <DaveMethvin> lemme  look
[09:20:37] <gibson042> yeah, that sounds familiar
[09:21:27] <DaveMethvin> nothing wired in afaict into index.html
[09:21:48] <gibson042> could be https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1bd576a3c4e9b95a4dcfe37fc58d3657ac10681e/test/unit/data.js#L153 or one of the surrounding lines
[09:22:17] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/data.js#L769 too
[09:22:48] <m_gol> yeah, but we didn't touch that code since forever
[09:22:59] <m_gol> and it started failing a couple of weeks ago
[09:23:08] <gibson042> it could be sensitive to a BrowserStack change
[09:23:08] <m_gol> we need to report it to them, what's the proper channel?
[09:23:35] <m_gol> browsers in BrowserStack should have all these alerts disabled anyway
[09:23:36] <DaveMethvin> i think we've been emailing their support, jzaefferer and Krinkle talk to them pretty regularly
[09:24:28] <m_gol> ok, I'll contact them
[09:24:32] <DaveMethvin> well we know IE didn't change so it must be the environment ... but i don't recall ever seeing those specific dialogs and they appear to be from the OS
[09:24:40] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[09:25:56] <DaveMethvin> thoughts onhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1494
[09:26:02] <DaveMethvin> whoops https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1494
[09:26:29] <gibson042> way too big to land
[09:26:35] <DaveMethvin> i want to encourage a new contributor but think it's too big
[09:26:50] <DaveMethvin> also seems like it could be reduced a log
[09:26:51] <DaveMethvin> lot
[09:26:58] <gibson042> the contributor didn't understand my original points, and I haven't yet had time to visit it myself
[09:27:14] <DaveMethvin> and perhaps doesn't need to address all the cases he's trying to solve
[09:27:34] <m_gol> mail sent, you should get a copy
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: can you go in and just reiterate your questions?
[09:27:54] <gibson042> doing it now
[09:27:58] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can keep him busy :)
[09:29:14] <DaveMethvin> i'll be interested to see what we get from the Google bug bounty
[09:29:58] <m_gol> all these script injection stuff gives us bad publicity
[09:30:11] <m_gol> also, I'd like to disable it as well ;)
[09:30:14] <DaveMethvin> it would definitely be nice to remove, perhaps in 1.13
[09:30:36] <DaveMethvin> allowing stuff to execute via injection is just a Bad Idea
[09:30:58] <DaveMethvin> but backcompat and all blah blah
[09:31:08] <DaveMethvin> i know we're gonna break stuff
[09:31:33] <DaveMethvin> people have these cool "components" consisting of a hunk of HTML and JS that they jam into pages
[09:32:29] <m_gol> gibson042: I don't fully understand your point here: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14228#comment:9
[09:32:41] <gibson042> jQuery 1.13: "we'll preserve the <script>s, but executing them is your problem" :)
[09:33:37] <DaveMethvin> (tm)
[09:33:58] <DaveMethvin> well we have parseHTML(..., true) for those cases
[09:34:22] <gibson042> m_gol: we have a single replacement pass right now (for adding close tags), and need to decide if a new hook replaces, or precedes and/or follows that call
[09:34:34] <m_gol> ok
[09:34:38] <m_gol> I'd say replacing is fine
[09:34:46] <m_gol> then we don't slow down the default code
[09:34:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm leaning that way too
[09:34:58] <timmywil> hai
[09:34:58] <m_gol> and at the same time we allow others to do what they think is right
[09:35:11] <DaveMethvin> hai timmywil
[09:36:06] <DaveMethvin> okay, that's about all i have for now, anyone got anything?
[09:36:18] <gibson042> I'm wondering if https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/261 necessitates a patch release
[09:36:40] <gibson042> we don't honor escape sequences inside `:contains`
[09:36:53] <gibson042> but it's been that way forever
[09:37:05] <DaveMethvin> i'd say let's try to tough it out :)
[09:38:04] <m_gol> I'd like to get this landed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1449 and see if it helps with our Android issues
[09:38:29] <DaveMethvin> Agreed, please, everyone be at least thinking hard about the 1.12/2.2 stuff you have ... in another week I'll want to start landing stuff in master
[09:38:35] <m_gol> but markelog isn't here so I'll need to ping him separately ;)
[09:39:04] <DaveMethvin> i haven't seen anything worth another release yet
[09:39:08] <DaveMethvin> another patch rel
[09:39:24] <m_gol> also, DaveMethvin, pinging again about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pulls :-)
[09:39:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's in my todo-inbox
[09:39:44] <m_gol> currently we're not testing Migrate on oldIE at all which is bad
[09:39:45] <DaveMethvin> i never seem to get that far down the box!
[09:39:48] <m_gol> ;)
[09:39:55] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll do that today
[09:40:00] <m_gol> I have 100 mails marked as super-duper-important in my inbox
[09:40:02] <m_gol> so I can relate ;)
[09:40:21] <DaveMethvin> super DUPER!
[09:40:25] <DaveMethvin> ok, that's about it?
[09:40:42] <DaveMethvin> in that case I'll see you in -dev guys
[09:40:43] <m_gol> I'd like to iron out the Android 2.3 issues
[09:40:51] <DaveMethvin> definitely
[09:40:55] <m_gol> it's getting forward slowly ;)
[09:41:10] <m_gol> there are some manipulation issues that might require a real fix, though
[09:41:19] <m_gol> in one set of tests
[09:41:46] <timmywil> gibson042: so, "'Phone' must match \"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}\"" works?
[09:41:46] <m_gol> it would be cool if we could extract those workarounds for old browsers to separate modules
[09:41:54] <m_gol> at least so old as Android 2.3
[09:41:55] <DaveMethvin> it will be easier to see the real bugs once we land all the odds and ends
[09:41:59] <m_gol> it's really a lot of code
[09:42:15] <m_gol> and some people don't need it
[09:42:26] <m_gol> it'll get only worse when we drop Safari <6 in 2.3
[09:42:39] <timmywil> oh, I see, he's escaping the escape character
[09:42:39] <m_gol> as A2.3 shares a lot of workarounds with it
[09:43:02] <m_gol> I've been asked about it by @maxodgen at Front Trends
[09:43:12] <gibson042> timmywil: right now, stuff "works" but not like it should
[09:43:37] <timmywil> what if we delimit by parenthesis and quotes?
[09:43:44] <timmywil> some combination thereof
[09:43:49] <gibson042> because in our fallback we pick up the quotes as characters to find
[09:44:40] <timmywil> the parens are required anyway, so the first quote wouldn't break it
[09:44:51] <gibson042> we just need to decide on what to do with the starting/ending/embedded examples from https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/261#issuecomment-42770942
[09:46:06] <timmywil> I'd like to be able to say that quoting always works
[09:46:26] <gibson042> yes, I'm almost taking that as given
[09:46:52] <gibson042> the corner cases are then those where someone might have intended to quote, but malformed it
[09:46:57] <timmywil> and let the other cases fall where they may
[09:47:09] <gibson042> they're basically independent
[09:47:33] <gibson042> quoting only doesn't work now because we're missing a .replace to unwrap escape sequences
[09:47:59] <timmywil> then I think that's the priority for the pull. Let's fix that first.
[09:48:18] <gibson042> will do
[09:48:33] <gibson042> I'll probably open a separate ticket for the other discussion
[09:48:44] <timmywil> cool
[09:49:23] <DaveMethvin> hey markelog! thanks for those pull requests btw
[09:49:40] <DaveMethvin> we've pretty much wrapped the meeting
[09:50:02] <DaveMethvin> so i'll close the room, we can continue in -dev
[09:50:03] <markelog> sorry, i'm late, i had a notification about the meeting, but i worked it through :(
