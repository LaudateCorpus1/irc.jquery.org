[10:04:31] <sfrisk> Meeting time
[10:04:42] <arthurvr> Hey everybody
[10:05:23] <sfrisk> arschmitz, arthurvr, geekman-rohit, kristyjy
[10:06:26] <sfrisk> It is time for our favorite day/time of the week
[10:06:29] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:08:22] <sfrisk> hey geekman-rohit: Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:09:22] <geekman-rohit> thanks, sfrisk
[10:09:55] <sfrisk> people attending, add yourself to the attendance list
[10:10:14] <arthurvr> done :p
[10:10:16] <sfrisk> Okay, so major focus for me today is pulling in the PRs related to fixing the build
[10:10:45] <sfrisk> But it doesn't look like the build is quite fixed - I know we had an issue with the 'dist' folder not getting created, which geekman-rohit said he would get on
[10:11:20] <sfrisk> We're also getting other grunt failures related to "grunt perf" https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/107
[10:12:09] <arschmitz> thats a bug in load-grunt-tasks or perf jankie it self
[10:12:16] <arschmitz> its not loading the task for some reason
[10:12:26] <arschmitz> we can work around it and manually load it though
[10:12:27] <sfrisk> Do you want to add that note to #107?
[10:12:47] <arschmitz> technically thats unrelated
[10:12:52] <arschmitz> it has nothing to do with the build
[10:12:56] <arschmitz> and does not effect grunt build
[10:13:14] <sfrisk> True, I think he's running grunt perf, but it would at least be nice to have a note on how to deal with that
[10:13:25] <arschmitz> grunt build works fine as long as you have a dist folder on that PR
[10:13:43] <arschmitz> grunt perf fails because of that bug
[10:14:33] <sfrisk> Well I'm just saying can you comment in that Issue about how grunt perf is failing because of a bug in perfjankie.  That or I can do it. I understand that it is unrelated to grunt build, but I would still like this community to be known for being helpful if possible
[10:14:59] <sfrisk> Since I know dylanb is interested in helping out with accessibility testing
[10:15:35] <arschmitz> yes what im saying is they are seperate fixes though and should not go into the PR for addressing that issue
[10:15:48] <geekman-rohit> problem with load-frunt-config maybe
[10:16:00] <geekman-rohit> coz loadNPMTask on perfjankie works just fine
[10:16:02] <sfrisk> well there isn't a PR for 107
[10:16:12] <sfrisk> it's dylan having issues with the grunt build
[10:16:16] <arschmitz> yes there is
[10:16:18] <arschmitz> 104
[10:16:23] <arschmitz> thats the issue with grunt build
[10:16:31] <arschmitz> just because it was opened after its the same issue
[10:16:54] <sfrisk> Okay true, and that's why I suggested he use the 104 PR
[10:17:01] <arschmitz> yup
[10:17:03] <sfrisk> because that would fix his problem
[10:17:26] <arschmitz> indeed
[10:17:29] <sfrisk> I was just wondering if you wanted to comment on #107 about what his issues with "perfjankie" might be, it doesn't need to be part of the PR
[10:17:36] <arschmitz> yes
[10:17:42] <sfrisk> but if you want, I can leave a comment instead
[10:17:49] <arschmitz> no im happy to
[10:19:13] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:20:12] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, the options are loading fine
[10:20:19] <geekman-rohit> it task isnt just being init or something
[10:20:25] <geekman-rohit> the task*
[10:20:53] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: simply adding grunt.loadNpmTasks( "perfjankie" ); fixes it
[10:20:58] <arschmitz> its just not loading the task
[10:21:07] <geekman-rohit> yep
[10:21:29] <geekman-rohit> we want to add that to Gruntfile now?
[10:21:36] <geekman-rohit> or find out what the bug is
[10:21:37] <geekman-rohit> ?
[10:21:44] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: no im adding it to the options
[10:21:52] <arschmitz> file for perfjankie for now
[10:22:02] <sfrisk> Okay, that works
[10:22:04] <arschmitz> better to get it fixed and track down 3rd party issues later
[10:22:26] <geekman-rohit> :+1 to that
[10:22:30] <sfrisk> and geekman-rohit, you mentioned making sure the 'dist' folder gets created in the gruntfile
[10:23:23] <arschmitz> that should go here https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/blob/master/tasks/variables.js
[10:24:10] <sfrisk> do you want to do that geekman-rohit, or arschmitz? once that gets in a PR, I'll start merging stuff in so our build is fixed
[10:24:18] <sfrisk> and then merge jsass into the buttons pr
[10:24:45] <geekman-rohit> i cant commit to arschmitz's pr
[10:25:02] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: you have 2 options
[10:25:03] <geekman-rohit> ill pull in his commits and do it ?
[10:25:10] <arschmitz> you can do a PR against my repo
[10:25:16] <arschmitz> or i can push it to a branch on chassis
[10:25:19] <arschmitz> and do a new PR
[10:25:27] <geekman-rohit> ill do a PR on ur repo
[10:27:39] <sfrisk> Okay, let me know when that's updated, and I'll pull that stuff in
[10:32:11] <sfrisk> Okay so after that, we've got the linting tasks
[10:32:23] <sfrisk> PRs*
[10:36:06] <sfrisk> So that would be https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/103
[10:36:12] <sfrisk> and https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/105
[10:36:33] <sfrisk> by geekman-rohit and arthurvr
[10:36:47] <arthurvr> mine should be good to go, or not arschmitz? I still donâ€™t really get it :p
[10:37:47] <arschmitz> arthurvr: no i said i was good with it you did what i wanted
[10:37:58] <arthurvr> oh, awesome :)
[10:38:08] <arschmitz> i just wanted you to update jscs
[10:38:19] <arschmitz> to remove the one var requirment rather then update the file
[10:38:30] <arthurvr> oh well, that should be done :)
[10:38:30] <geekman-rohit> mine will need a review
[10:38:38] <sfrisk> Okay, well then I'll pull that in
[10:38:39] <arschmitz> arthurvr: yes you did it
[10:39:17] <geekman-rohit> do we have to remove oneevar from jscs as well
[10:39:34] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: thats what i asked him to do / he did
[10:39:36] <geekman-rohit> we use the preset, which does "requireMultipleVarDecl": onevar
[10:39:40] <sfrisk> I'll agree with arthurvr, I wasn't quite sure if you were happy with it or not
[10:40:14] <arschmitz> sorry no i was arthurvr did exactly what i asked and it was my only thing i had found with the PR
[10:40:22] <geekman-rohit> he did jshint*
[10:41:00] <arschmitz> oh sorry i thought it was both your right
[10:41:09] <arschmitz> no the jscs version needs to be bumpted
[10:41:12] <arschmitz> bumped
[10:41:32] <geekman-rohit> i dont think they have a release with the new preset yet
[10:41:37] <arschmitz> yes they do
[10:41:39] <geekman-rohit> atleast they didnt last i checked
[10:41:41] <arschmitz> we use it on other projects
[10:42:24] <geekman-rohit> they did a release last night
[10:42:30] <geekman-rohit> 2.00 we gonna bump to that?
[10:42:31] <arschmitz> the several of the core maintiners are jquery team member so it gets updated almost same day
[10:42:47] <arschmitz> when we make style guide changes
[10:43:14] <arschmitz> yes we should bump to whatever the latest is
[10:43:30] <arschmitz> we will probably need to run fix as well because it probably also contains some spacing changes
[10:43:43] <arschmitz> from the version we are on
[10:43:47] <arthurvr> alright
[10:44:17] <arschmitz> i want to say the current version is pre when we did the collapse parens change
[10:44:19] <geekman-rohit> i overrid it in my PR
[10:44:30] <geekman-rohit> ill change that and update the version instead
[10:44:40] <geekman-rohit> i overrid the oneevar rule
[10:45:31] <arschmitz> current jscs has autofixer anyway for spacing
[10:45:43] <arschmitz> so this shold be as simple as a version bump and run with fix true
[10:46:05] <geekman-rohit> run with fix true? Im not sure I understand
[10:46:15] <arschmitz> its an option on the jscs task
[10:46:20] <arschmitz> it fixes issues for you
[10:46:27] <arschmitz> instead of failing
[10:46:42] <geekman-rohit> yep
[10:46:45] <geekman-rohit> understood
[10:48:26] <sfrisk> so Arthur's is PR is good, but we have a few updates to make to Rohit's?
[10:49:19] <geekman-rohit> yes
[10:49:32] <arthurvr> Yay!
[10:50:02] <sfrisk> Okay, so Arthur, I'll pull in your PR, once geekman-rohit updates arschmitz's PR
[10:50:28] <sfrisk> and there will be a PR inception and it will be very exciting
[10:50:42] <sfrisk> and then once that works, I'll pull in the tiny stuff
[10:51:01] <sfrisk> also please review https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/106
[10:51:20] <sfrisk> and if someone is interested in taking over the table styling PR
[10:51:27] <sfrisk> that is up for grabs now
[10:52:14] <geekman-rohit> i have meter and progress up my sleeve now, if it merges and goes good ill take table
[10:52:54] <sfrisk> Okay, I'm gonna add the other states for buttons too this week
[10:52:54] <geekman-rohit> im new to sass so treading carefully, lol
[10:53:22] <arthurvr> Cool!
[10:53:27] <arthurvr> We could also use thoughts on #108
[10:54:01] <sfrisk> Luckily, geekman-rohit, we have lots of resources to help out with that in reviewing
[10:54:09] <sfrisk> actually arthurvr, that was up next
[10:54:37] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/108
[10:55:21] <sfrisk> the commit right now is just a basic remove of a .DS_Store file, but it did bring up global ignore
[10:56:27] <arschmitz> this was already discussed
[10:56:28] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/22
[10:57:27] <arthurvr> yep - so it looks like that one should be good to go.
[10:57:40] <sfrisk> Okay, that's one is easy, I'll pull that in
[10:58:11] <sfrisk> Okay, kristyjy, how goes SCSS Style Guide?
[11:01:18] <sfrisk> hrm, guess she had to leave
[11:01:21] <kristyjy> yeah so I had made quite a few changes to it based on the media query stuff before so I need to go through and revert those and then add a few more items. I'm going to try to get a PR in asap
[11:01:30] <sfrisk> Okay
[11:01:34] <sfrisk> eta on that?
[11:01:56] <kristyjy> before next weeks meeting

[11:03:22] <sfrisk> Okay, good meeting everyone, let me know when geekman-rohit's PR on arschmitz' PR is good to go
