[09:00:22] <DaveMethvin> aaallllrightythen
[09:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's been a few hours since the core release and no bug reports against UI yet :-P
[09:02:29] <DaveMethvin> gotta try harder
[09:02:40] <DaveMethvin> did git one against the migrate plugin already
[09:02:44] <DaveMethvin> no test case yet tho
[09:03:05] <DaveMethvin> who's here
[09:03:18] <gibson042> crap, did we drop the "break jQuery UI" ticket?
[09:03:32] <DaveMethvin> i was sure boolhook was gonna do that
[09:03:53] <DaveMethvin> we'll get them on the final release gibson042, don't worry
[09:04:04] <mikesherov> listening
[09:04:09] <mikesherov> ping me if necessary
[09:04:17] <DaveMethvin> kk
[09:04:46] <DaveMethvin> well let's get going, the missing folks can check the log or meeting notes
[09:05:12] <DaveMethvin> i'm just waiting for a bunch of bugs to be reported, let's see how that goes
[09:05:20] <DaveMethvin> but in any case the beta(s) are out
[09:05:33] <DaveMethvin> i think we should use github for the migrate bugs
[09:05:42] <DaveMethvin> people already are, so there's that :P
[09:05:59] <DaveMethvin> there was some discussion in an earlier mtg about using trac
[09:06:03] <gibson042> yeah, hard to disagree when 2 out of 3 are mine
[09:06:06] <DaveMethvin> but i think it would be better to use gh
[09:06:17] <DaveMethvin> well if i didn't want to use it i shoulda shut it off
[09:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> +1 gh
[09:06:27] <DaveMethvin> and sizzle does as well
[09:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> Even though I don't really like GitHub Issues.
[09:06:51] <DaveMethvin> i agree it isn't flexible enough for core so i'm okay with trac for that
[09:07:02] <DaveMethvin> but i hope our list of migrate bugs will be relatively small
[09:07:08] <DaveMethvin> and easy to manage in gh issues
[09:07:27] <DaveMethvin> okay, that's decided
[09:07:36] <DaveMethvin> i have to go back and check the blog, it may need editing
[09:07:51] <DaveMethvin> alright, now we have jquery 2.0 pass 1 assignments
[09:08:08] <DaveMethvin> for now i think we should just remove oldie quirks and leave the tests untouched
[09:08:13] <DaveMethvin> see how far that gets us
[09:08:35] <DaveMethvin> and then branch off 1.9
[09:08:39] <DaveMethvin> land the first pass
[09:08:43] <DaveMethvin> fix what blows up
[09:09:04] <DaveMethvin> so first thing, who wants what? i figured it would be easiest to break it up by file
[09:09:18] <DaveMethvin> altho support will need to be touched by a lotta people
[09:09:19] <gibson042> do we have the 1.9 branch yet?
[09:09:23] <DaveMethvin> no
[09:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> When people are going through, cleaning stuff up, they should normalize the browser-specific comments to: // support: {browser} {version}
[09:09:31] <DaveMethvin> oh good idea scott
[09:09:40] <DaveMethvin> i'll make a note
[09:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> I forget where the idea came from. It was someone on the core team a long time ago.
[09:10:07] <DaveMethvin> came from mike
[09:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> But we've been doing it for UI, it's really nice.
[09:10:24] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: what format do you use for multiple versions?
[09:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> / support: Opera, IE <9
[09:11:11] <DaveMethvin> so, comma
[09:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> So if you're searching, you'd need to use a regex.
[09:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> And you can't search for version numbers.
[09:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you wanted to expand to // support: IE6, IE7, IE8
[09:11:58] <DaveMethvin> we're not gonna have so many that you can't just look for // Support
[09:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> Or I guess IE 6, IE 7, IE 8 if we want version spacing to be consistent across browsers.
[09:12:05] <DaveMethvin> and visually inspect
[09:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I do.
[09:12:24] <DaveMethvin> and here we're just talking about 2.0, not trying to go back to change 1.9
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> We have a lot of "support: jQuery <1.8" :-P
[09:12:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah who wrote THAT crap
[09:13:17] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil gibson042 what about sizzle for 2.0?
[09:13:40] <DaveMethvin> would you git a big bump from making a branch w/o oldIE support?
[09:13:54] <DaveMethvin> or is it too horrific to contemplate?
[09:14:12] <DaveMethvin> don't forget you'll be able to use ES5 features
[09:14:32] <gibson042> I've been operating on the assumption that Sizzle would keep broad support all the way back
[09:14:38] <gibson042> but it might be worth investigating
[09:15:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah you might get some ideas after we refactor jquery code
[09:15:36] <DaveMethvin> anything on the list in the meeting notes that anyone wants to claim?https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:15:38] <gibson042> it's definitely less important at the selector engine level than higher up in jQuery
[09:15:54] <DaveMethvin> some of those should be pretty easy, at least for a first pass
[09:16:16] <DaveMethvin> so if nobody claims them i will probably go through and do some cleanup
[09:16:34] <DaveMethvin> orkel really wanted to play with traversing so i'll ping him on that one
[09:16:51] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: how's your availbility the next couple of weeks?
[09:17:05] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: will you have some time?
[09:17:09] <gibson042> not great this week, remains to be seen after that
[09:17:21] <DaveMethvin> HUMBUG! :D
[09:17:23] <gibson042> if I do have time I'll probably grab whatever's opne
[09:17:25] <gibson042> *open
[09:17:27] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:17:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah just put your name next to it on the agenda here so we won't get any duplication
[09:18:16] <DaveMethvin> manipulation should have a great payback, removing all the oldie shimming crap
[09:18:27] <DaveMethvin> but i was going to leave that glory to someone else
[09:18:49] <DaveMethvin> traversing can probably use the nextElementSibling etc
[09:19:00] <DaveMethvin> which may get rid of a few loops
[09:19:07] <DaveMethvin> where we have to look for text/comment nodes
[09:19:15] <gibson042> yeah
[09:19:35] <DaveMethvin> i was kind of hoping to talk jaubourg into ajax at least
[09:19:41] <gibson042> core will be fun too
[09:19:53] <DaveMethvin> i feel like a kid in a candy store
[09:19:59] <DaveMethvin> or is it a bull in a china shop
[09:20:04] <DaveMethvin> whatever
[09:20:58] <DaveMethvin> i do have some concerns about non-oldIE strange browsers like the old Android browser but we'll have to see how quirky those guys get when we test the edges of ES5 support
[09:21:24] <DaveMethvin> i know there were some issues with Safari 5.0 ES5 but i'd have to look up what they were
[09:21:45] <gibson042> we haven't settled on compatibility yet, have we?
[09:22:00] <DaveMethvin> no, a few more of the really old ones may fall
[09:22:11] <gibson042> we can let browser capabilities guide us to some extent
[09:22:24] <DaveMethvin> i'll bet the old mobile browsers will be the most troublesome
[09:22:45] <gibson042> gotta get them running out TestSwarm jobs
[09:22:49] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:23:39] <DaveMethvin> so, mikesherov sent around the note about grunt 0.4
[09:23:53] <DaveMethvin> i haven't played with it yet myself, sounds like we have to get the plugins working
[09:24:22] <DaveMethvin> perhaps we defer that until after the new year?
[09:25:24] <DaveMethvin> has mergeatron been working? didn't seem like it
[09:25:41] <gibson042> I'm pretty sure it's been down for a while
[09:25:55] <DaveMethvin> WE MUST FIX THE IE8 TWO PIXEL BUG
[09:26:07] <DaveMethvin> whatever caused it to come back, it must be un-caused
[09:26:17] <gibson042> HEAR HEAR
[09:26:35] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: was it a style change to the outer page? can that be reverted
[09:26:55] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Yes, Bootstrap has been updated.
[09:27:01] <Krinkle> But that has dependencies, it is integrated now.
[09:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I think we can get core on grunt 0.4 before the new year.
[09:27:16] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: so the problem should go away?
[09:27:17] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: However the css patch we had in our bootstrap made it upstream
[09:27:22] <DaveMethvin> yay
[09:27:37] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: if so, that's great
[09:27:46] <DaveMethvin> mainly that was me pondering that nobody would get to it
[09:27:46] <Krinkle> so though I do think it is that css leakage bug again from IE8, I have no idea what property is leaking this time
[09:27:52] <DaveMethvin> but if someoen does, all the better!
[09:27:53] <Krinkle> font-size and line-height are unchanged
[09:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> All the plugins are updated, so it's just a matter of updating core's Gruntfile.
[09:28:05] <Krinkle> so it must be something that plays together with other factors
[09:28:13] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[09:28:25] <DaveMethvin> this has been the most bizarre bug
[09:28:41] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: No, I didn't fix the offset issue with IE8. I updated bootstrap and saying it cant' easily be reverted since bootstrap is very integrated now.
[09:29:08] <Krinkle> I think jzaefferer was the one who figured out which property was being leaked, maybe he can work his magic again?
[09:29:16] <DaveMethvin> well i would rather have a butt-ugly page than failing tests
[09:29:18] <Krinkle> (last summer that is)
[09:29:19] <rwaldron> Sorry I'm late, started new client project this week
[09:29:30] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Yes
[09:29:40] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: check the notes and grab a module if you have time this week
[09:30:02] <rwaldron> cool
[09:30:04] <rwaldron> looking
[09:30:05] <DaveMethvin> i think it was mikesherov who found the 14px font issue causing the 2px problem
[09:30:24] <mikesherov> we need to get away from iframe for testswarm
[09:30:30] <Krinkle> jquery-migrate? what happened to jquery-compat?
[09:30:36] <DaveMethvin> name change Krinkle
[09:30:40] <rwaldron> holy geeze I'm excited for next monday
[09:30:41] <Krinkle> k
[09:30:54] <Krinkle> mikesherov: yep, but that's a long term solution. I've been working on that for a long time, but its not easy
[09:31:15] <DaveMethvin> wanted to emphasize the migration aspect not the "your broken code can work forever" aspect
[09:32:25] <DaveMethvin> okay let's skip the tickets for today, there's nothing too critical in there
[09:32:38] <DaveMethvin> i really REALLY would like to fix that ie8 issue
[09:32:56] <DaveMethvin> and honestly the styling of the outer frame is not important at all to me
[09:33:04] <DaveMethvin> i want the tests to succeed
[09:33:38] <gibson042> is there something we could do by tweaking the css etc. in our iframe page?
[09:34:03] <DaveMethvin> maybe? :)
[09:34:29] <gibson042> I looked last night but didn't see anything obvious; now I'm just throwing it out there
[09:34:33] <DaveMethvin> let me update the blog post, just a sec
[09:35:08] <DaveMethvin> ugh, this is going to take some fancy wording
[09:35:21] <DaveMethvin> if you have the compat plugin loaded you need to go to gh
[09:35:26] <DaveMethvin> but if not, go to bugs.jquery.com
[09:35:44] <DaveMethvin> now i remember why we were gonna do this on trac :)
[09:36:36] <DaveMethvin> well let me muddle through somehow
[09:36:48] <DaveMethvin> any other things we should discuss this week?
[09:37:16] <DaveMethvin> if not, i will meet you one foggy christmas eve
[09:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> I had something, but I completely forgot what it was :-/
[09:37:34] <DaveMethvin> well you know where i'll be
[09:37:40] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys
[09:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I remember :-)
[09:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like quite a few of us don't like our style guide.
[09:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> 2.0 seems like a good time to make a change if it's ever going to happen.
[09:40:31] * scott_gonzalez wonders if everyone left already
[09:40:58] <gibson042> I'm still here scott_gonzalez
[09:41:16] <gibson042> I'm thinking it'd be best as an issue on https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.com
[09:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I should start a thread on the devs list first?
[09:42:49] <gibson042> that works too
[09:43:11] <DaveMethvin> ok, blog updated
[09:43:21] <DaveMethvin> and yeah i think that would be better as a wider discussion
[09:43:59] <DaveMethvin> closing the door and turning out the lights
