[11:00:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ gseguin agcolom cgack
[11:00:42] <gseguin> All right stop, Collaborate and listen...
[11:00:50] <cgack> howdy
[11:00:52] <arschmitz> hi
[11:01:18] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:02:11] <gseguin> what's up yo?
[11:02:45] <uGoMobi> let's start with the 1.4.3 release
[11:03:04] <gseguin> let's do this!
[11:03:11] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[11:03:17] <gseguin> I'm available today for that
[11:03:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: need more time for the page events demo and maybe some PRs/
[11:03:28] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:03:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just pushed update to page events
[11:03:53] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:03:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: need _|Nix|_ to go through and try that out also _|Nix|_ is working on a test to add to it
[11:04:31] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:04:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: how is that looking?
[11:05:02] <uGoMobi> what about the other PRs? are those things that can wait until 1.4.4?
[11:05:07] <cgack> I think we ought to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7252 to 1.4.4 milestone (unless of course its good to go as is)
[11:05:23] <cgack> adding the _destroy() to toolbar
[11:05:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was going to suggest we go over each one right now
[11:05:28] <arschmitz> and decide
[11:05:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[11:05:39] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&labels=Action%3A+PR+needs+reviewing&milestone=30&sort=updated&state=open
[11:06:00] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[11:06:05] <_|Nix|_> I just got the first test to pass.
[11:06:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[11:06:15] <_|Nix|_> Just plain go-to-another-page test.
[11:06:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i just pushed an update to fix pageload
[11:06:32] <_|Nix|_> I still wanna do page load failed.
[11:06:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, cool!
[11:06:45] <_|Nix|_> I'll update the test.
[11:06:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the demo also includes a pageloadfailed example now
[11:07:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Excellent!
[11:07:18] <arschmitz> as well as popup and select
[11:07:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, there was that circular reference the stringify was refusing to parse.
[11:07:43] <arschmitz> ok so open PR's
[11:07:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: fixed that
[11:08:09] <uGoMobi> ok let's start with Cory's PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7252
[11:08:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: happens when you try to stringify a jquery object
[11:08:22] <agcolom> Hi, sorry, got delayed
[11:08:33] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[11:08:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have a function to fix that but missed an instance
[11:09:06] <arschmitz> yes cgack had a question on this
[11:09:25] <arschmitz> cgack: when is the footer in the body that we need to worry about it in destroy?
[11:10:20] <cgack> Yeah when we appendTo("body") do we need to track the original position for destroy
[11:10:47] <cgack> and I've been pretty busy all week and haven't circled back on this until now
[11:11:01] <arschmitz> cgack: that only happens durring a transition
[11:11:10] <arschmitz> cgack: with old persistent toolbars
[11:11:20] <arschmitz> and it is then removed completely
[11:11:51] <uGoMobi> and we don't support destroy during a transition :)
[11:11:51] <arschmitz> cgack: in other words you dont need to worry about that ever being the case in destroy
[11:12:00] <cgack> super!
[11:12:18] <arschmitz> also the code that does that is being removed in 1.5 its deprecated
[11:13:08] <cgack> okay well then that answers that question, the rest is just a final review of the _destroy() I added - and if that halts 1.4.3 I say bump to 1.4.4
[11:13:29] <arschmitz> cgack: i looked quickly already but had been meaning to ask you about that
[11:13:40] <arschmitz> if i recall it looked good but i will look again
[11:14:20] <uGoMobi> ok, so if the PR is good to go it will land in 1.4.3
[11:14:36] <uGoMobi> next one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6719
[11:15:27] <arschmitz> yeah that one is good to go i just need to rebase and land it
[11:15:39] <arschmitz> i meant to when i did a whole bunch last week guess i missed it
[11:15:46] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:15:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can do it if you're too busy.
[11:15:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just give it the :+1:
[11:16:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure
[11:16:29] <uGoMobi> next https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7258
[11:16:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: update the commit message of course
[11:16:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, and I'll double-check the real-name thing.
[11:17:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i already confirmed the cla and everything
[11:17:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Great!
[11:18:13] <uGoMobi> I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7258 needs more testing first
[11:18:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im pretty sure its the same now in grunticon
[11:18:42] <arschmitz> which is why i had asked that person in the first place
[11:18:49] <arschmitz> let me look right now
[11:18:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[11:20:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope even in master they are still using the one we have
[11:20:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so yeah this needs more testing as id be surprised if they missed this
[11:20:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[11:21:09] <arschmitz> 1.4.4 it is
[11:21:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you gave it üëç ... did you test it?
[11:21:37] <gseguin> I don't remember
[11:21:58] <uGoMobi> ok, well 1.4.4 it is
[11:22:02] <_|Nix|_> Man, I'm waaay behind on my Unicode ... I can't see the thumbs-up character :(
[11:22:14] <gseguin> I'm thinking if we're testing for inline SVG support why are we inlining a gif?
[11:22:15] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7260
[11:22:57] <gseguin> or is it just testing inlining support
[11:22:58] <gseguin> ?
[11:23:09] <uGoMobi> have to give it a look
[11:23:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill give that one a final look over but i think its good
[11:23:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[11:23:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: i believe that one is just inline support but not sure
[11:23:34] <uGoMobi> last one...https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7370
[11:23:45] <_|Nix|_> Definitely 1.4.4
[11:23:56] <gseguin> arschmitz: ok, then sorry for giving it üëç
[11:24:19] <arschmitz> yeah that demos is a beast lol
[11:24:29] <uGoMobi> it is
[11:24:36] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:24:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i remember we talked about it again but dont recall where its at right now?
[11:25:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know there was a bunch of stuff you were going to update
[11:25:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ... I need to fix up the front page for the demo, and have all the demo intro pages point to the front page.
[11:25:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok sounds good
[11:25:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Instead of chaining one demo intro page to the next.
[11:26:07] <arschmitz> yeah i remember now
[11:26:12] <uGoMobi> did anyone fix this issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7310
[11:26:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and we talked about highlighting bits that would be skipped via server-side if-statements.
[11:26:22] <uGoMobi> ticket might be a duplicate
[11:26:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right yeah i liked that idea
[11:26:55] <uGoMobi> I can't reproduce the issue with a 1.4-stable local build or on view.*
[11:27:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its fixed
[11:27:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just waiting for release
[11:27:15] <arschmitz> gseguin: right?
[11:27:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: with magic or a commit?
[11:27:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: mostly magic i assume :)
[11:27:47] <gseguin> arschmitz: what?
[11:27:56] <uGoMobi> just want to be sure because we always have issues with some demos
[11:27:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: lol didnt you fix the transitions demo?
[11:28:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: or was that _|Nix|_?
[11:28:13] <uGoMobi> this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7310
[11:28:15] <gseguin> shit, I don't remember either
[11:28:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what do you remember?
[11:28:26] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:28:27] <arschmitz> is a build issue
[11:28:39] <gseguin> that having a goldfish memory is annoying at times
[11:29:01] <uGoMobi> I will scan the commits again
[11:29:29] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a9d37bef04c80021155141495854cd400f8f0a4b
[11:29:36] <uGoMobi> so we need to do some last PR reviews and the changelog
[11:29:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: "I have a great mind, but it's very short." -- Albert Einstein
[11:29:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks!
[11:30:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope wrong that fixed different demo issue
[11:30:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ;)
[11:30:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and mine isn't even that great :/
[11:30:43] <arschmitz> damn we gotta make sure this is fixed
[11:30:56] <arschmitz> i thought it was but if not people comment like daily on twitter about it
[11:31:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: still, shouldn't that commit be in 1.4-stable as well
[11:31:13] <gseguin> I can do a build  and make sure the built demos work
[11:31:18] <arschmitz> yes it needs to be
[11:31:47] <_|Nix|_> The commit that introduces cheerio?
[11:31:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unrelated
[11:32:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thought that was where you fixed transitions demo
[11:32:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you remember if you did fix that demo?
[11:32:22] <uGoMobi> ah it is in 1.4-stable
[11:32:27] <_|Nix|_> No.
[11:33:11] <_|Nix|_> I don't even remember what I fixed with that.
[11:33:35] <_|Nix|_> Oh, right ... classic theme ...
[11:33:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you find it?
[11:33:59] <_|Nix|_> The regexs were too aggressive. Needed actual BNF grammer.
[11:34:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, I only found that cheerio commit in 1.4-stable
[11:34:19] <arschmitz> oh
[11:34:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will investigate further after the meeting
[11:34:45] <_|Nix|_> So, then, classic theme demo should be broken in master ...
[11:34:46] <arschmitz> ok so maybe this isnt fixed maybe im crazy i swear we fixed this though
[11:34:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no that commit is in master
[11:35:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can't reproduce in a build
[11:35:50] <_|Nix|_> Wow ... just conf00sion, al-round.
[11:36:19] <gseguin> arschmitz: same here, clean build no problem
[11:36:47] <uGoMobi> I can easily reproduce with demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/demos/
[11:37:04] <uGoMobi> - demos/
[11:37:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes that has been broken but im pretty sure we fixed the build i just cant find where
[11:37:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will try to trace it after the meeting
[11:37:35] <arschmitz> ok
[11:37:36] <_|Nix|_> Can we not post some tag on that Web site just to test?
[11:38:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its easy to test local
[11:38:54] <arschmitz> and no i dont thing we should push a random tag we have lots of tooling build around semvar that would probably explode
[11:39:03] <uGoMobi> to be sure I can test with a 1.4.2 local build
[11:39:14] <uGoMobi> to see if you can reproduce it local as well
[11:39:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Just checking...
[11:39:52] <uGoMobi> anyway, we have to be completely sure that we fixed it
[11:40:05] <_|Nix|_> It kinda sucks that we can't stage this though.
[11:40:12] <cgack> i'm not sure how demos.jquerymobile.com is built but it looks like its a deploy step issue right, so local should _always_ work?
[11:40:56] <cgack> or i'm crazy
[11:41:00] <_|Nix|_> cgack: I think this is about running grunt, then loading the demos from dist/
[11:41:05] <gseguin> cgack: deploy is a copy to a git repo
[11:41:13] <gseguin> and then add/commit/push
[11:41:46] <_|Nix|_> Well, dist/demos/transitions/ works fine for me.
[11:41:56] <_|Nix|_> ... after running grunt
[11:42:08] <_|Nix|_> So, it must be something else.
[11:42:31] <gseguin> best is to checkout 1.4.2 and try
[11:42:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you focus on those last PRs and your page events demo I can clean up the changelog
[11:42:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll do that.
[11:43:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we cant run changelog until everything is pushed
[11:43:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: gseguin : that's what I just said
[11:43:23] <gseguin> uGoMobi: sorry for not paying attention
[11:43:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah right
[11:44:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry, now I'm dead-set on reproducing it :)
[11:44:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: go ahead
[11:44:12] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:44:20] <gseguin> working locally on 1.4.2
[11:44:36] <_|Nix|_> Same here.
[11:44:43] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:44:46] <_|Nix|_> Could it be a redirect thing?
[11:44:50] <uGoMobi> weirddd
[11:44:53] <_|Nix|_> We do some redirecting on demos.jquerymobile.com
[11:44:59] <_|Nix|_> Like, from / to /1.4.2/
[11:45:17] * agcolom pick up time. Will be back later on dev
[11:45:26] <uGoMobi> later agcolom
[11:45:29] <cgack> https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/tree/master/1.4.2/transitions holds the root of 1.4.2
[11:45:31] <_|Nix|_> Of course, I don't see why transitions/ should be affected, and no other page.
[11:45:34] <gseguin> gotta run too :(
[11:45:47] <uGoMobi> later gseguin
[11:45:50] <_|Nix|_> cgack: Aaah! That's bad.
[11:46:26] <_|Nix|_> Might just need to fix that up manually.
[11:46:42] <uGoMobi> I suggest we release on Monday
[11:46:59] <uGoMobi> we have a few more things to do and Friday is not a good release day
[11:47:04] <arschmitz> wo what the heck
[11:47:09] <_|Nix|_> üëç
[11:47:12] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:47:16] <arschmitz> cgack: thats crazy
[11:47:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 21:45:47 < cgack> https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/tree/master/1.4.2/transitions holds the root of 1.4.2
[11:47:42] <cgack> grunt copy error or something? perhaps
[11:47:55] <arschmitz> cgack: i dont know interesting too
[11:48:08] <arschmitz> cgack: its the root minus transitions to not make it an infinite loop
[11:48:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I am looking at it O_O
[11:48:23] <_|Nix|_> Super-weird.
[11:48:45] <_|Nix|_> That's why it'd be nice to be able to push another tag to it without the whole thing blowing up.
[11:49:06] <_|Nix|_> How about cloning the repo, and then replacing the destination with the clone?
[11:49:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or just fix the demos repo
[11:49:20] <arschmitz> like he have for all the other demos issues
[11:49:27] <arschmitz> creat thing about having a demos repo
[11:49:30] <arschmitz> great
[11:49:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm saying to make sure that the next time we push a tag, it's not gonna end up doing the same thing.
[11:49:56] <arschmitz> but need to figure out why it happened and make sure it does not
[11:50:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[11:50:15] <_|Nix|_> The tools that end up pushing to that repo may be doing it.
[11:50:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you dont need to push a tag to do that
[11:50:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it copys the repo copys files then pushes the repo to github
[11:50:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all we need to do is a test release
[11:50:55] <arschmitz> and check local
[11:51:17] <arschmitz> not a test build but a test release
[11:51:40] <_|Nix|_> Oh-OK.
[11:51:59] <arschmitz> unless you think git push is somehow broken ? :)
[11:52:16] <_|Nix|_> No, I doubt that.
[11:53:04] <uGoMobi> any updates about 1.5 development?
[11:53:37] <uGoMobi> regarding deprecating/removing style options... we are now at collapsible
[11:53:43] <arschmitz> i need to schedule some time to talk to felix about select menu and native select before i go further with select i think
[11:53:44] <uGoMobi> which is a tricky one
[11:54:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah good idea
[11:54:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we shoudl deprecate collapsible instead
[11:54:16] <arschmitz> and work on using accordian
[11:54:58] <arschmitz> or at least look into it before we invest more time in collapsible it seems like it should be a simple one
[11:55:41] <uGoMobi> adopting accordion is on the roadmap for 1.7 but we could change that to 1.6
[11:56:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if it is not going to be much work we should just not do ANYTHING to collapsible
[11:56:30] <arschmitz> and just have them work on accordian as part of style option removal
[11:56:54] <uGoMobi> yeah, makes sense
[11:57:09] <_|Nix|_> Implementing the collapsible API with accordion might be a worthy goal for 1.5.0
[11:57:13] <arschmitz> its a really simple widget it should be almost as easy as tabs i would guess
[11:57:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why just deprecate collapsible and introduce accordion
[11:58:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I see what you mean.
[11:58:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and they coexist in 1.5.0.
[11:58:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[11:58:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was wondering how we are going to do that with selectmenu... can't have two widgets with the same name in one vesion
[11:58:54] <uGoMobi> version*
[11:59:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope but we have some options there
[11:59:13] <arschmitz> some sort of compatibility layer
[11:59:18] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[11:59:37] <arschmitz> or you can rename a widget and have ti under a flag
[11:59:41] <arschmitz> few options
[11:59:46] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:00:03] <uGoMobi> cgack: anything about navbar this week?
[12:00:16] <cgack> yes -I had a quick question about navbar
[12:00:16] <cgack> I unwittingly added a listview dependency for the morebutton popup
[12:00:16] <cgack> I assume I should refactor with CSS and remove the listview yes?
[12:01:20] <_|Nix|_> Well, if it's a listview, it's a listview.
[12:01:28] <arschmitz> cgack: that actually points out a flaw in our builder
[12:01:33] <arschmitz> and our css dependencies
[12:01:42] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we could make it only depend on the css
[12:01:47] <uGoMobi> of listview
[12:01:49] <arschmitz> cgack: we should have a way to depend on a widgets css without its js
[12:01:56] <uGoMobi> but not the widget
[12:01:57] <uGoMobi> right
[12:02:16] <_|Nix|_> OK, so, lemme get this straight. We're not actually instantiating a listview, but we're adding all the styles?
[12:02:39] <cgack> currently i'm .listview()-ing but was wondering if I should avoid that
[12:02:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what we should be doing most likely not sure i have not looked
[12:03:06] <_|Nix|_> Worst. Timing. Ever.
[12:03:21] <uGoMobi> welcome back
[12:03:52] <cgack_> hey
[12:03:52] <_|Nix|_> I guess it makes sense to not instantiate a listview for just a few items.
[12:04:07] <uGoMobi> yeah, let's try to avoid that
[12:04:10] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, you wanna avoid duplicating code like dealing with ui-first-child and ui-last-child.
[12:04:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats already broken out and this will always be a list of the same form
[12:04:29] <_|Nix|_> Is listview really so bad?
[12:04:41] <arschmitz> not maybe its this type or maybe its that type business
[12:04:49] <arschmitz> no options
[12:04:52] <cgack_> well i was thinking of a custom build people might not want it
[12:05:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess you can pass the children to _addFirstLastClasses()
[12:06:38] <_|Nix|_> Then it might be time to do what arschmitz suggested - an empty module that depends only on the listview CSS, and listview depends on the empty module.
[12:06:48] <cgack_> of course if you've decided to go with the morebutton - you've already decided you want popup, so why not listview too
[12:07:25] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... why does listview depend on page?
[12:07:26] <arschmitz> cgack_: not a bad point
[12:07:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should not
[12:07:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ?
[12:07:43] <_|Nix|_> .. because, otherwise it's actually not that heavy.
[12:07:44] <uGoMobi> we fixed that for 1.4
[12:07:52] <_|Nix|_> ... and you don't need any of its extensions.
[12:08:08] <_|Nix|_> OK, then we need to get rid of that dependency.
[12:08:18] <_|Nix|_> I'll file an issue for 1.4.4.
[12:08:23] <arschmitz> accordion in mobile http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1439/edit
[12:08:56] <arschmitz> so should be pretty easy
[12:09:40] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:09:47] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss?
[12:09:50] <cgack_> okay - well rather than reinvent wheels - I'll stick with listview now for this extension to navbar
[12:11:50] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:11:54] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[12:11:57] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
