[11:02:06] * gabriel_schulhof waves
[11:02:09] <jasperdegroot> hola
[11:02:26] <cgack> howdy
[11:02:37] <gabriel_schulhof> You know you have a small kid when ... you see that and think "Yo soy Dora!" :)
[11:02:47] <arschmitz> lol
[11:02:54] <arschmitz> ill add a page to the agenda just a sec
[11:04:43] <arschmitz> ok its there
[11:05:05] <arschmitz> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=38
[11:06:14] <gabriel_schulhof> I've got one thing for panel ... whenever ...
[11:06:28] <arschmitz> just add it to the agenda
[11:07:38] <agcolom> Sorry, a bit late... I'm here now
[11:07:48] <arschmitz> ok well since thats first gabriel_schulhof go ahead
[11:08:15] <gabriel_schulhof> So, when a widget is visible but truncated, the autogrow height is calculated to a nn incorrect value.
[11:08:31] <gabriel_schulhof> It's much taller than it needs to be.
[11:08:48] <gabriel_schulhof> So, the height needs to be calculated synchronously right after the class that causes the truncation is removed.
[11:08:58] <gabriel_schulhof> That's already happening in popup as part of an earlier fix.
[11:09:12] <gabriel_schulhof> The same thing needs to happen in panel, but panelbeforeopen is too soon for that to happen.
[11:09:43] <gabriel_schulhof> We either need a new event right after we remove ui-panel-closed and replace it with ui-panel-open, or we need to move panelbeforeopen right after that point.
[11:10:12] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or we don't care that the textarea animates to the correct height upon initial panel open.
[11:10:40] <arschmitz> see i personally dont mind seeing the animation
[11:10:46] <arschmitz> but i know some people seem to
[11:10:52] <gseguin> sorry for being late
[11:11:10] <arschmitz> agcolom: gseguin: no problem your both here now :)
[11:12:42] <gabriel_schulhof> So, basically, the problem with moving the existing panelbeforeopen event is that another panel starts listening for that event and closes when it is triggered.
[11:13:12] <gabriel_schulhof> So that means that that event has to be triggered before the opening panel checks that another panel is open and waits for that panel to close, otherwise there's deadlock.
[11:13:23] <arschmitz> right
[11:13:25] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyway ... I'm fine with leaving things the way they are.
[11:13:49] <gabriel_schulhof> People can always turn off the animation via CSS.
[11:13:56] <cgack> is this something we should just add to keep in mind for a panel rewrite?
[11:14:01] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and then it'll still jump, but at least it won't be conspicuous.
[11:14:20] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Good point.
[11:14:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Should I open an issue for panel re-write?
[11:15:52] <gabriel_schulhof> I remember when I ran into this problem in popup, I had to separate the un-truncating from the un-hiding, and trigger popupbeforeopen in-between the two, so things are still off-screen, but their width/height is no longer set to 0.
[11:16:04] <gabriel_schulhof> I dunno why height calculations mess up when one of the dimensions is 0.
[11:16:36] <arschmitz> yeah i think file this as an issue for re-write
[11:16:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it's not the dimension of the textarea, either. The textarea's parent is the one that's truncated.
[11:17:35] <gabriel_schulhof> I would argue that this is a browser shortcoming. I wonder if there's some CSS way to fix this.
[11:17:55] <jasperdegroot> it looks a bit odd http://jsbin.com/sekujuqa/8 but not high priority if you ask me
[11:18:15] <jasperdegroot> +1 for waiting with this until panel rewrite
[11:22:21] <arschmitz> any new 1.4.3 regressions this week?
[11:22:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Not that I'm aware of.
[11:22:57] <arschmitz> execlent
[11:23:22] <cgack> just the one in the persistent toolbar demo - not a regression though
[11:24:52] <arschmitz> any one have any updates for 1.5 ?
[11:25:08] <cgack> I think i'm ready for another set of eyes on my navbar-review branch
[11:25:23] <arschmitz> ill look this week
[11:25:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, just today's development. Gonna have proper same-page navigation in 1.5.0.
[11:25:46] <cgack> arschmitz: thanks
[11:26:12] <arschmitz> im working on a document of all the current navigation api
[11:26:17] <arschmitz> as a starting point
[11:26:28] <gabriel_schulhof> That is, you get a transition not only when you .pagecontainer( "change", $.mobile.activePage, { allowSamePageTransition: true } ), but also when you reach a page that was navigated to via that call by clicking the browser's back/forward buttons.
[11:26:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Currently, the latter results in an instant switch to that page. No transition.
[11:28:55] <arschmitz> scott and i also started discussing how we come together on ui select menu in the dev leads meeting yesterday
[11:29:21] <arschmitz> going to talk to felix more about it next week since he wrote the ui one
[11:33:24] <arschmitz> ok any one have anything else i know gseguin has been working on an issue with iframes and ios
[11:33:29] <arschmitz> but not much hope there
[11:35:50] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm good!
[11:42:33] <arschmitz> ok anything from the community
[11:42:35] <arschmitz> ?
