[12:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> AW WTF?
[12:03:31] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz awayrxaviers fnagel jzaefferer scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll rxaviers
[12:03:39] <fnagel> hey
[12:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> At least if b-ot is gonna rebel, I get a link to Jenna Marbles :-)
[12:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> So, button...
[12:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> We didn't end up with anyone that wanted to go through the tickets to verify them at the dev summit.
[12:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> So that still needs to be done.
[12:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> We had our datepicker/CLDR discussion.
[12:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> And we have a plan to move forward.
[12:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> We've decided to use the runtime modules internally.
[12:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll generate the formatters and parsers we need for our demos and tests and include that in our repo as an external.
[12:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll add some functionality to the download builder to let users choose the locales they want to support.
[12:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> Or they can opt to not bundle Globalize and then just load Globalize themselves with whatever functionality they need.
[12:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Anything else to discuss for datepicker right now?
[12:11:52] <fnagel> no, waiting for awayrxaviers to adjust that first day issue and the grunt snippet. Hopefully can work on the grunt task this weekend.
[12:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok, sounds good
[12:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> The dev summit was pretty good.
[12:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> For UI specifically, we had a few tickets closed.
[12:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we'll get some longer term contributors from it, but I'm not sure.
[12:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.

[13:01:44] <agcolom> kswedberg: zz_AurelioDeRosa: good afternoon :-)
[13:01:51] <agcolom> meeting time :-)
[13:01:53] <kswedberg> hello
[13:02:03] <sfrisk> hello
[13:02:22] <agcolom> Hey kswedberg, sorry I didn't reply to your email, but 100% with what everyone said :-)
[13:02:28] <agcolom> hey sfrisk!
[13:02:42] <kswedberg> oh, np. :-)
[13:03:05] <sfrisk> hey agcolom!
[13:03:09] <agcolom> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[13:03:48] <arthurvr> Hey everyone
[13:03:52] <agcolom> So We had the dev summit... And that was really good!
[13:03:57] <agcolom> Hey arthurvr!
[13:03:58] <arthurvr> I’m here but for only like 10 minutes :/
[13:04:25] <agcolom> Did you have anything you wanted to share with us/discuss arthurvr since you have to leave v soon?
[13:04:35] <arthurvr> Not really, no.
[13:04:44] <agcolom> ok.
[13:05:08] <kswedberg> agcolom: can you tell us a few key things you took away from the dev summit?
[13:05:17] <agcolom> So dev summit. We got attendees all setup and ready to contribute
[13:05:24] <arthurvr> o/
[13:05:28] <agcolom> some made PRs that have already landed :-)
[13:05:40] <kswedberg> awesome!
[13:05:41] <agcolom> Some made PRs that are ready to land :-)
[13:05:45] <arthurvr> I noticed. Really cool :)
[13:06:09] <arthurvr> I wonder if we can do something to make sure they stay motivated now
[13:06:13] <arthurvr> and stay contributing
[13:06:21] <agcolom> The event was very well organised, the attendees were fantastic, and really enthusiastic
[13:06:27] <agcolom> A wonderful experience
[13:07:01] <sfrisk> I know Chassis we were thinking about doing some sort of hack weekend for people who got into Chassis
[13:07:06] <sfrisk> maybe do something similar for content?
[13:07:52] <agcolom> How would you organise that?
[13:08:23] <agcolom> (weekends are hard for me with kids)
[13:08:41] <arthurvr> Dunno but I don’t think we really have the spare time for that
[13:09:01] <sfrisk> understandably, could be tough
[13:09:01] <arthurvr> we *don’t really
[13:09:21] <arthurvr> I like the idea for Chassis though
[13:09:55] <agcolom> So we're hoping people will continue to contribute. So we should try to look at PRs fairly quickly in order to keep the enthusiasm going
[13:10:13] <agcolom> I think that summarises the dev summit...
[13:10:21] <arthurvr> :+1:
[13:10:29] <agcolom> sfrisk: did I miss anything?
[13:10:41] <sfrisk> I don't think so
[13:10:50] <sfrisk> There were a lot of awesome people there eager to contribute
[13:10:57] <agcolom> Ok, then we have some ongoing issues...
[13:11:25] <arthurvr> Should probably just handle Aurelio’s tickets on github as he isn’t here.
[13:11:34] <agcolom> Arthur, any update on New grunt-jquery-content feature allows to set up redirects in the repo (redirects.json)
[13:11:55] <agcolom> arthurvr: yes
[13:12:11] <arthurvr> Had some troubles finding all the correct ones to setup but have a commit ready to PR
[13:12:32] <agcolom> yay!
[13:12:50] <arthurvr> (in the infra repo all redirects match for urls starting with a specific part while we should match exact pages in redirects.json.
[13:13:03] <arthurvr> Which makes it kinda difficult to find the right pages back in the git history
[13:13:17] <arthurvr> luckily splunk helps
[13:14:00] <agcolom> good
[13:14:28] <agcolom> if you have any questions regarding splunk, you can ping clarkbox
[13:15:02] <arthurvr> For the ”Status on the http -> https redirects” item, I’m going to take care of that soon. Got some time soon to work on OSS stuff upcoming days.
[13:15:28] <arthurvr> … and I gotta leave, train just arrived.
[13:15:32] <arthurvr> Bye everyone!
[13:15:40] <kswedberg> bye arthurvr !
[13:15:49] <agcolom> bye arthurvr
[13:15:53] <agcolom> thank you!
[13:16:00] <sfrisk> bye arthurvr!
[13:16:13] <agcolom> so that was it from me really...
[13:16:16] <kswedberg> also, about http->https, Chrome doesn't do the mixed content warning thing anymore. they've simplified.
[13:16:50] <kswedberg> so you either get the green padlock or you get the blank sheet of paper as the icon
[13:18:07] <agcolom> oh, that's what that means... (blank sheet)
[13:18:41] <kswedberg> yeah, so if it's http:// or if it has mixed content, it gets the blank sheet.
[13:20:12] <agcolom> interesting! I was wondering why a site I was looking at today had that!
[13:20:30] <kswedberg> :)
[13:20:58] <agcolom> So I will land the update on the learn site for the mobile article.
[13:21:04] <agcolom> yay :-)
[13:21:29] <agcolom> that's it from me...
[13:21:37] <agcolom> any other things need discussing?
[13:21:49] <sfrisk> Nothing from me
[13:21:56] <kswedberg> nothing here
[13:22:32] <agcolom> ok, Thanks everyone
[13:22:46] <agcolom> :-)
[13:23:23] <agcolom> See you all in 2 weeks or on -content!
