[14:01:31] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[14:01:40] <sfrisk> nashvail, asrchmitz, geekman-rohit
[14:02:17] <geekman-rohit> hey
[14:03:31] <sfrisk> so kristyjy is out this week
[14:03:50] <sfrisk> inputs is waiting on the normalize thing, which I haven't heard anything about progress with that
[14:03:58] <sfrisk> so I'll go work on that either tonight/tomorrow
[14:04:01] <sfrisk> so we can wrap up inputs
[14:04:20] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit - do you have anything?
[14:04:23] <geekman-rohit> i think we should target on merging nashs prs this week
[14:04:41] <sfrisk> yeah - well some of that depends on the normalize being brought back in
[14:04:55] <geekman-rohit> some may require some more work if we all review again
[14:05:07] <sfrisk> I would like to get kristyjy's table stuff done too, but she's in non internet zone
[14:05:41] <geekman-rohit> i hope she is back soon
[14:05:54] <geekman-rohit> our all components still don't feel like.. One
[14:06:17] <geekman-rohit> they all have their own things and styles.. and even mixins are all differently used
[14:08:58] <sfrisk> she's out until the 12th
[14:09:07] <sfrisk> so she should be back for next meeting
[14:09:54] <geekman-rohit> sounds good to me
[14:10:31] <sfrisk> okay, so I'm gonna get the normalize stuff done tonight/tomorrow.  After that's done, I'll ping nashvail to pull in latest master into inputs
[14:10:42] <nashvail> alright
[14:10:47] <sfrisk> so we can hopefully finalize that and get that pulled in this week
[14:10:55] <sfrisk> or pretty soon in any case
[14:10:56] <nashvail> I have went through some grid stuff as well
[14:11:27] <nashvail> we sure are keeping grids optional? as display: grid proposal looks pretty solid
[14:11:51] <nashvail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paBou8Fy25k
[14:15:20] <sfrisk> what do you mean, keep grids optional?
[14:16:22] <nashvail> optional as in other components won't depend on it
[14:19:05] <geekman-rohit> they shouldn't
[14:19:30] <sfrisk> grid is it's own thing
[14:19:41] <sfrisk> just like basic buttons are their own thing
[14:19:45] <sfrisk> or inputs are their own thing
[14:19:53] <geekman-rohit> but all components should work good with grid
[14:19:59] <geekman-rohit> especially form and table
[14:20:41] <sfrisk> yes
[14:21:57] <sfrisk> but I like the idea of a first pass flexbox based grid
[14:22:21] <sfrisk> and the step 2 is the "well we need to support older browsers" version maybe?  I believe that's what we agreed to last meeting
[14:28:47] <sfrisk> okay, I need to get to another meeting for work
[14:29:08] <sfrisk> but I'll have the PR for normalize up by tomorrow night, and someone feel free to yell at me if I don't
[14:29:18] <sfrisk> and I'll ping everyone to read it over to make sure we're good to go
[14:29:20] <sfrisk> sound good?
[14:31:11] <nashvail> üëç
[14:33:23] <sfrisk> okay good
[14:33:29] <sfrisk> see you next week
