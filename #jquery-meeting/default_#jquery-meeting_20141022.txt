[09:00:05] <rxaviers_> hello
[09:00:09] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:00:13] <jzaefferer> ola
[09:00:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[09:00:15] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> So we released 1.11.2 last week :-)
[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> We did have one regression reported so far.
[09:01:15] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:17] <jzaefferer> Which one was that?
[09:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10669
[09:02:49] <tj_vantoll> It's an odd one.
[09:03:08] <tj_vantoll> I tried to figure out a bit more but failed.
[09:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> Master is now 1.12.0-pre, so we can land some PRs that have been sitting.
[09:04:13] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1342
[09:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, like that one :-P
[09:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it on my list to do a final review now that you've fixed the last issue.
[09:05:06] <tj_vantoll> Ah I meant to paste https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/milestones/1.12
[09:05:55] <tj_vantoll> I'm working on the font-size: 62.5% removal too. I'll have a PR for that one soon.
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> I can't wait for that one :-)
[09:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Got a button, etc. update?
[09:08:15] <arschmitz> there is a pr for classes
[09:08:57] <arschmitz> ill push button updated with classes everything from jzaefferer review and backcompat any minute
[09:09:24] <arschmitz> just double checking a few things right now
[09:10:03] <mikesherov> hi
[09:10:06] <arschmitz> i updated some things on the wiki too
[09:10:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the classes pr implements what you suggested with making it default to this.element now
[09:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> Hey mikesherov. Did you see the draggable regression?
[09:10:33] <arschmitz> which does reduce the code a bit
[09:10:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: no
[09:10:45] <mikesherov> link?
[09:10:52] <mikesherov> will address today
[09:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10669
[09:11:04] <mikesherov> is it a big one?
[09:11:14] <arschmitz> i also fixed a few test failure in classes that cropped up when i rebased it on master
[09:11:20] <mikesherov> NOOOOOOO
[09:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it gets pretty whacky.
[09:11:26] <mikesherov> connectToSortable kills me
[09:13:03] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov: This one is a bit wacky too. I dug in a little and got nowhere.
[09:13:09] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I'll do reviews of classes and button (once updated) again
[09:13:14] <mikesherov> OK
[09:13:20] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: cool thanks
[09:13:27] <mikesherov> I figured connectToSortable would regress a bit
[09:13:34] <mikesherov> there were so many other edge cases I handled
[09:13:39] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez said he was going to do a round on classes also so we can try to get that landed
[09:13:41] <mikesherov> I figured I had to be breaking a few with no tests
[09:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel has been making more progress on calendar/datepicker.
[09:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> There will be a new PR soon, right?
[09:14:06] <fnagel> I will push a new PR this eveneing
[09:14:22] <fnagel> * evening
[09:14:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: one thing to mention i removed all commits related to button to make it not conflict with the button branch after it lands
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> There's a ticket about selectmenu not honoring the tabindex of the original select: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10665
[09:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> There's actually code written to make this work, it's just half implemented and broken.
[09:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd rather remove this than fix it.
[09:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> Using tabindex >0 is generally a bad idea.
[09:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> W3C is even considering deprecating it.
[09:17:00] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: makes sense
[09:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to closing as wontfix and removing the existing broken code?
[09:17:33] <arschmitz> im ok with it if thats the suggestion even from W3C
[09:17:50] <fnagel> yeah the tabindex is very simple, pertty much what was in the filament group selectmenu
[09:18:13] <jzaefferer> should we throw an error when using tabindex > 0 with selectmenu?
[09:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[09:18:21] <jzaefferer> or just ignore it?
[09:18:36] <arschmitz> thats not a breaking thing so i would ignore
[09:19:05] <tj_vantoll> I'm in favor. But if/when we close the ticket we should link to the W3C discussion if there is one.
[09:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> ehttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2014Oct/0027.html
[09:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> Minus the leading e :-P
[09:20:35] <tj_vantoll> Perfect. We should keep the code in that sets tabindex to -1 when the disabled option is set though.
[09:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:20:58] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: well thats not > 0
[09:21:16] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I was just clarifying to make sure we're on the same page.
[09:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, jzaefferer suggested removing globalize updates from the UI meetings.
[09:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> And only discussing it when it relates to things that are actually in UI.
[09:22:40] <mikesherov> +1
[09:22:48] <scott_gonzalez> So with that in mind, rxaviers is there anything to discuss this week?
[09:23:27] <rxaviers> Should I bring globalize issues in here or let's discuss them in dev?
[09:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> Let's discuss in dev.
[09:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> We can add a standing meeting for globalize if it becomes necessary.
[09:24:05] <jzaefferer> What's the status of currency formatting in Globalize?
[09:24:25] <rxaviers> ok
[09:24:39] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will answer you in dev.
[09:24:42] <jzaefferer> Also can we migrate to Globalize 1.x without all the unrelated AMD changes?
[09:24:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: we need currency formatting for spinner, so that is actually relevant for UI
[09:25:21] <jzaefferer> We don't need to discuss collaboration with out i18n projects here
[09:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> From dev: Raphael Amorin was supposed to be working on currency. But, no update so far. He's talked with me this weekend and said he couldn't work on anything yet. But, that he would.
[09:29:28] <jzaefferer> Is that the only blocker for spinner + Globalize 1.x?
[09:29:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: ^^^
[09:30:45] <rxaviers> Yeap, it's a blocker for spinner's demo and I guess the only one.
[09:31:04] <rxaviers> When is spinner+Globalize 1.x due to?
[09:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> The sooner the better.
[09:32:33] <jzaefferer> "Also can we migrate to Globalize 1.x without all the unrelated AMD changes?"
[09:32:56] <scott_gonzalez> We're stuck on 0.x until spinner can use Globalize.
[09:33:06] <rxaviers> and datepicker right?
[09:33:18] <jzaefferer> Datepicker in master doesn't use Globalize
[09:33:20] <jzaefferer> only spinner
[09:33:34] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, on regard of AMD changes, we can, but it's easier with the AMD changes in place.
[09:33:53] <rxaviers> Re: "Datepicker in master doesn't use Globalize only spinner" ok
[09:34:06] <jzaefferer> Because you're using requirejs to load CLDR files?
[09:35:32] <rxaviers> Having AMD changes in place, yeap I'd use requirejs to load CLDR files. An alternative is to use $.get requests.
[09:37:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: is it worth waiting more for Raphael Amorin?
[09:38:47] <rxaviers> Good question. I can take it to myself if we want it to be done faster. No problem.
[09:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz has an updated classes PR.
[09:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> We should get a few pairs of eyes on it.
[09:41:50] <scott_gonzalez> And see if this is the best/smallest implementation we can get.
[09:42:10] <arschmitz> yeah anything to slim it down would be good if anyone has ideas
[09:42:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how about you look into the AMD updates again. Afterwards, implement currency yourself, if there's still no progress
[09:42:32] <jzaefferer> I need to go now
[09:43:54] <rxaviers> works for me
[09:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> And finally, arschmitz has some details about jsbin...
[09:45:55] <arschmitz> So for mobile i have talked to remy and he is going to donate us a Pro account which gives a vanity url like jquerymobile.jsbin.com
[09:46:04] <arschmitz> and you can manage the default template through git
[09:46:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Sweet!
[09:46:20] <arschmitz> including things like editor config to use tabs vs spaces and 4 space tabs
[09:46:50] <arschmitz> and i know tj_vantoll has a whole set of ui templates in jsfiddle
[09:46:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Super cool!
[09:47:07] <arschmitz> but jsfiddle has some draw backs like not being able to actually remove the iframe any more
[09:47:13] <arschmitz> no pretty url
[09:47:14] <arschmitz> etc
[09:47:28] <arschmitz> so is this something ui would be interested in as well?
[09:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think so.
[09:47:46] <arschmitz> jsbin is also open source
[09:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> Would like to hear what tj_vantoll thinks.
[09:47:52] <arschmitz> which is i think big for us
[09:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> I've always liked jsbin better than jsFiddle.
[09:48:29] <gabriel_schulhof> Me too.
[09:48:31] <tj_vantoll> I'm not sure I'm following. What would be using jsbin for?
[09:48:49] <arschmitz> issue templates
[09:48:58] <arschmitz> like the jsfiddle ones you already have
[09:49:13] <arschmitz> just port them over to a jsbin pro account for jquery-ui
[09:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> But we could have URLs like jqueryui.jsbin.com/draggable/
[09:49:28] <tj_vantoll> Ah ok. Yeah I'm fine with that.
[09:49:30] <fnagel> and everybody could just use them to build examples?
[09:49:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: the draggable part im still not sure about
[09:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[09:49:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We should have one for Ajax.
[09:50:10] <arschmitz> im checking with him i think you might just get the one template but then you can save the others and just link to them from an index like
[09:50:15] <arschmitz> jqueryui.jsbin.com
[09:50:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we do already its in a branch i need to submit a pr for
[09:51:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but i wanted to see UI decision first before i bug remy again
[09:51:18] <tj_vantoll> Yeah something like this http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/Qp39S/show/
[09:51:37] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: exactly i was thinking basicly just move that exactly to jsbin
[09:52:08] <fnagel> tj_vantoll: wow, thats very useful!
[09:52:16] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: http://emberjs.jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output
[09:52:17] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, yeap, fantastic
[09:52:23] <arschmitz> thats for example what ember has right now
[09:52:38] <arschmitz> you get to customize the header too
[09:53:04] <tj_vantoll> So we'd have shared credentials to access the pro account then?
[09:53:30] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: the template is managed through git
[09:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/tree/4fcce8413d046f1871f22976f63e77c46ddb11ad/public/custom
[09:53:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: exactly what i was in the process of pasting
[09:54:42] <tj_vantoll> Ah that's slick.
[09:55:31] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah
[09:55:36] <arschmitz> and remy is super responsive
[09:56:08] <arschmitz> ever since i worked with him to fix some mobile nav issue that were jsbin specific he actually pings me when making changes he thinks might effect us
[09:56:21] <tj_vantoll> Ok yeah let's do this.
[09:56:27] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: sweet
[09:56:37] <arschmitz> ill talk to remy about a UI account also
[09:57:06] <arschmitz> and once i get the ok from him we can do a PR for it
[09:57:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Does it impose less if we go with jquery.jsbin.com/{ui,mobile,etc.}?
[09:57:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im not sure thats possible
[09:57:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Or does that not offer enough flexibility for us?
[09:58:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: nothing iv seen so far indicates its possible to do /anything
[09:58:16] <arschmitz> but its something im going to ask about
[09:58:22] <gabriel_schulhof> OK ... I guess it has to be a subdomain then.
[09:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm 99% he used to have custom paths for logged in users.
[09:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> I could be remembering it wrong though.
[09:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> This was like five or six years ago.
[09:58:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah im not sure im just going to talk to him and see what he says is out best option and how to do it
[09:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> No? Great! Ending exactly on time :-)
[09:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
[09:59:29] <tj_vantoll> nice
[09:59:33] <gabriel_schulhof> L8R
