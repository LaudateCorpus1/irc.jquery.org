[10:10:06] <michaelarestad> Hi!
[10:10:13] <arschmitz> oh has to be all by it self
[10:10:24] <sfrisk> Welcome to the wonderful world of Chassis weekly meeting
[10:10:28] <sfrisk> I'm your host, sfrisk
[10:10:42] <sfrisk> after a week long absence from being on a business trip with extremely limited internet
[10:10:47] <arschmitz> apparently i am terrible at b-ot commands
[10:10:57] <arthurvr> arschmitz: :)
[10:11:20] <sfrisk> We have a fantabulous agenda for today, found at the usual location on Google Drive: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:12:13] <sfrisk> So first thing I wanted to discuss was roadmap for this project
[10:12:37] <sfrisk> since this was something I've been thinking about lately, since I had to write the article for Net Magazine (coming out in the June edition sometime in April)
[10:12:52] <sfrisk> plus we had the question about it in https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/39
[10:13:44] <arthurvr> Sure. Would definitely help new contributors
[10:14:03] <michaelarestad> And our planning for features/etc.
[10:14:13] <arthurvr> of course :)
[10:15:05] <arschmitz> roadmaps for a project are just a generally good thing
[10:15:35] <sfrisk> So the basic idea I had was CSS Framework -> UI Toolkit -> Rule the World
[10:15:44] <sfrisk> or Profit for the last one
[10:16:12] <sfrisk> CSS framework meaning that version 1.0 will be just a CSS framework, the building blocks of a site, but without all the widget/UI components
[10:16:22] <sfrisk> so typography, whatever we choose to do for a grid, form, etc
[10:16:25] <sfrisk> helper classes
[10:16:54] <michaelarestad> I would keep it as minimal as possible to start.
[10:17:05] <michaelarestad> It's easier to add features than remove them. :)
[10:17:11] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:17:20] <sfrisk> thus why version 1.0 is the framework - bare bones
[10:17:24] <michaelarestad> Awesome.
[10:18:02] <sfrisk> version 2.0 is when we go all UI-kit and start implementing components that are common projects like jQuery mobile/jQuery UI
[10:18:05] <sfrisk> example being accordian
[10:18:50] <sfrisk> that would definitely be a more complicated step though, than version 1.0, especially since it will involves more opinions about how markup should be done, etc
[10:20:21] <michaelarestad> Is ROADMAP.md a thing?
[10:20:26] <sfrisk> I should probably make it
[10:20:33] <sfrisk> I'll share the article I wrote for net magazine with you guys
[10:20:34] <arschmitz> i would make a wiki
[10:20:39] <michaelarestad> Awesome.
[10:20:45] <arschmitz> there is no reason to commit the roadmap to the repo
[10:20:46] <michaelarestad> Ooh! A wiki.
[10:20:56] <michaelarestad> That's probably a better idea.
[10:21:19] <arschmitz> once we have a webpage i would put it there but until then
[10:21:39] <arthurvr> Yes, seems like the way to go :)
[10:21:55] <michaelarestad> We're about a logo and super basic html page away from that.
[10:22:01] <michaelarestad> And from what I've seen, the logo's there.
[10:22:16] <arthurvr> Just the decide the color isn’t it?
[10:22:21] <sfrisk> I'll create a wiki page for it then
[10:22:24] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:22:40] <arschmitz> well not exactly
[10:22:46] <arschmitz> once we pick the base color
[10:22:55] <arschmitz> he will come up with variations for different usages
[10:23:10] <sfrisk> do we want to create a wiki page for the scss style guide? or keep that to a PR?
[10:23:12] <arschmitz> isaacdurazo: thats what you had mentioned before correct ^^
[10:23:42] <arschmitz> sfrisk: wikis prevent discussion
[10:23:47] <arschmitz> you cant comment
[10:23:48] <isaacdurazo> arschmitz: I think we should have a wiki page w
[10:24:09] <arschmitz> isaacdurazo: sorry that was for above about the colors
[10:24:10] <sfrisk> I thought you could suggest changes and stuff?
[10:24:14] <isaacdurazo> something pretty simple
[10:24:25] <sfrisk> I guess it's different from bitbuckets, which are treated a bit like repos themselves
[10:24:45] <arschmitz> wikis dont have notification either
[10:25:03] <arthurvr> Actually wikis are technically repos too (but miss features like PRs, so no/less discussion
[10:25:27] <sfrisk> ahh. :-/
[10:25:37] <sfrisk> ok, PR for that then, and wiki for the roadmap
[10:25:43] <arthurvr> I think a style guide always needs discussion, so PR, ya.
[10:27:25] <sfrisk> okay
[10:27:28] <sfrisk> works for me
[10:27:35] <sfrisk> also, here is the google group url: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/css-chassis
[10:27:53] <sfrisk> decided to make it public, where you ask permission to join/post, to prevent spam
[10:28:26] <arthurvr> Is it like team members only or can everybody just join?
[10:28:53] <sfrisk> they have to ask permission to join
[10:29:00] <sfrisk> I assume it's anyone interested in the project
[10:30:22] <sfrisk> I'll add a question to help weed out spammers in the request
[10:30:26] <sfrisk> to join the group
[10:30:44] <arthurvr> seems fine
[10:33:01] <michaelarestad> Note: I think most discussions should really take place on Github.
[10:33:10] <arschmitz> +1
[10:33:16] <sfrisk> definitely
[10:33:16] <arthurvr> Sure.
[10:33:50] <sfrisk> this is more for non issue discussion, like you won't be available for a week, or something like that I would assume
[10:34:46] <arschmitz> exctly
[10:34:58] <michaelarestad> Got it.
[10:35:54] <michaelarestad> I may not be available much this week. Merging a thing int WP core has been sucking up 100% of my extra time. I'm hoping to spend a little time (somehow) to address the changes to get that super old PR finally merged in.
[10:36:16] <sfrisk> Understood
[10:36:26] <sfrisk> it's mostly copy changes right now I think, correct?
[10:37:12] <sfrisk> for the readme file
[10:37:19] <michaelarestad> I think so.
[10:38:20] <sfrisk> one sec, let me check - maybe one of us could help you out with the copy change if you're hit with deadlines and stuff this week
[10:38:30] <sfrisk> and work being all work-y
[10:38:45] <sfrisk> ohhh, on that note, I won't be around much the latter half of next week (vacation)
[10:39:04] <michaelarestad> I can add anyone to my fork of the repo if someone wants to make the changes.
[10:39:24] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: we can clone your fork too
[10:39:44] <michaelarestad> Cool.
[10:40:13] <sfrisk> Okay, arschmitz and I can help address those changes then, if you're busy michaelarestad
[10:40:16] <sfrisk> somce ot
[10:40:20] <michaelarestad> I really am.
[10:40:30] <sfrisk> I believe you
[10:40:33] <sfrisk> I've been there :-)
[10:42:08] <sfrisk> since* it looks like the changes are just suggestions on the copy for building
[10:42:10] <sfrisk> grunt
[10:44:11] <michaelarestad> Would definitely appreciate it.
[10:45:15] <sfrisk> no problem :-)
[10:45:42] <sfrisk> okay, last thing on the list is Performance testing - any more news there, arschmitz?
[10:45:51] <arschmitz> no iv been very busy
[10:46:03] <arschmitz> have not had a chance to get back to it
[10:46:10] <sfrisk> okie dokey, no problem
[10:46:16] <sfrisk> so goals for this week
[10:46:36] <sfrisk> add yourself to the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/css-chassis)
[10:46:56] <sfrisk> and then either myself or arschmitz will help update the PR, unless someone else wants to
[10:47:23] <sfrisk> I'll also add a roadmap to the wiki to help with explaining the project to new contributors
[10:47:55] <arthurvr> SGTM :)
[10:47:56] <sfrisk> Can anyone think of anything else that needs to be added?
[10:48:48] <gnarf> We enabled CLA checks recently
[10:48:54] <gnarf> so make sure y'all have signed it :)
[10:49:21] <sfrisk> Thanks, gnarf :-)
[10:49:36] <arthurvr> awesomesauce!
[10:51:23] <sfrisk> Okay, then if that's everything, I declare this meeting officially adjourned
[10:51:31] <sfrisk> and I'll see all of you next week, same time, same place
[10:52:08] <michaelarestad> Later!
