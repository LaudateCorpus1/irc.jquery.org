[12:01:07] <bethge_> Hi there
[12:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> Your PR for making `gotpointercapture` and `lostpointercapture` into actual `PointerEvent`s is good to merge.
[12:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/271
[12:04:54] <bethge_> ok, nice
[12:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> I also landed your README update for the capitalization consistency.
[12:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to `pointerenter` and `pointerleave`: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/197
[12:06:46] <bethge_> hehe, indeed. nkronlage already gave some great feedback
[12:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> Which you have a WIP PR for; https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/274
[12:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yup :-)
[12:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Do we need to discuss anything for that right now?
[12:07:41] <bethge_> I will get back to the drawing board for that. Do you have experience with document.range? It works in somewhat mysterious ways for me
[12:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> You might want to also check the behavior when you move over an iframe.
[12:08:07] <bethge_> Good point!
[12:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> I've done some work with ranges when I was working on RTEs.
[12:09:10] <bethge_> Would you say ranges are the way to go to find the common ancestor of two nodes?
[12:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'd personally avoid ranges unless you actually care about the range.
[12:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'd use .contains()
[12:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> And then walk the DOM if one node doesn't contain the other.
[12:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> I can try to write that portion of the code this afternoon if you'd like.
[12:11:52] <bethge_> Sure, that would be great!
[12:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> So if a contains b, you want to get a back, right?
[12:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> But if one is not a descendant of the other, you want the nearest ancestor.
[12:13:54] <bethge_> if "a" is a descendeant of "b", I would want "a" back, I believe
[12:14:00] <bethge_> right right
[12:14:01] <bethge_> sry
[12:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll work on that after the meeting.
[12:14:53] <bethge_> Great thanks :)
[12:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[12:16:57] <bethge_> Thats all from me
[12:20:12] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, I guess we're done.
[12:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks
[12:21:15] <bethge_> Thanks :)
[14:01:05] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: apsdehal1: cgack: gabrielschulhof cogwurx agcolom: sfrisk: meeting time
[14:01:24] <cogwurx> happy thursday!
[14:01:30] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:01:46] <sfrisk> it is thursday
[14:01:53] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:02:59] <cgack> howdy
[14:03:18] <agcolom> hi,
[14:03:39] <agcolom> My daughter has to use my laptop to finish her homework
[14:03:42] <apsdehal1> hi
[14:04:03] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=154577118
[14:04:35] <arschmitz> so we are down a few pull requests despite some being opened
[14:04:37] <arschmitz> which is great
[14:05:01] <arschmitz> issue count is up
[14:05:15] <arschmitz> iv been running table tests trying to figure that out
[14:05:32] <arschmitz> but it looks like cgack you pushed a change but it fails more places now?
[14:06:16] <cgack> I've just been hacking. I put a QUnit.skip in and it fails differently now, but nothing makes it better. I'm going to revert that because its not right
[14:06:33] <cgack> still works fine in the browser on the branch
[14:06:38] <arschmitz> ok
[14:06:47] <cgack> http://view.jquerymobile.com/8341-table-classes-option/tests/unit/table/?jquery=2.1.1
[14:06:49] <arschmitz> let me know when you revert so im working with clean code
[14:06:54] <cgack> seems fine but fails on travis
[14:07:06] <cgack> the branch on jquery-mobile is clean
[14:07:07] <arschmitz> ui upgraded to phantom 2
[14:07:18] <arschmitz> maybe we should look into same
[14:07:46] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: that would be a great thing for you to look int
[14:08:07] <arschmitz> you upgraded everything pretty recently
[14:08:40] <apsdehal1> Yes.
[14:10:41] <arschmitz> great
[14:10:50] <arschmitz> that might help a lot of flaky tets
[14:10:58] <cogwurx> I have one more thing to clean up on the styles. I got slammed this week so I couldn't give it much attention.
[14:11:07] <cogwurx> *for the demo site
[14:11:32] <arschmitz> cogwurx: no problem
[14:11:40] <arschmitz> happens to all of us
[14:11:51] <cogwurx> :-]
[14:11:56] <arschmitz> cgack: want to talk about the issue you pinged me on
[14:12:03] <cgack> yeah sure.
[14:12:29] <cgack> so with panel, the demos have an issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8324
[14:13:03] <cgack> but it seems that this is happening because the ui-panel-wrapper is being applied before the ui-toolbar-header, etc are being applied
[14:13:08] <cgack> so it only applies to ui-content
[14:13:40] <cgack> I'm having a hard time tracking it down and don't know if we need to make panel have a toolbar dependency or something else I'm missing
[14:14:53] <gabrielschulhof> Sounds like enhancement order issues.
[14:15:15] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: is there is a clear cut way to define that order?
[14:15:45] <arschmitz> not really because things that dont have a dependency should not be dependant
[14:15:59] <gabrielschulhof> Only with AMD dependencies, and those have to be justified very strongly.
[14:16:27] <gabrielschulhof> ... and AFAICT toolbar and panel are conceptually orthogonal.
[14:16:56] <arschmitz> this is basicly because of all the complicated wraper stuff we are doing for panel
[14:17:41] <cgack> except panel requires .ui-toolbar-header... etc, when doing _getWrapper, else it falls to ui-content
[14:18:02] <arschmitz> yeah we need to look at and re think this
[14:19:02] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: im getting an error from panel in demos
[14:19:02] <gabrielschulhof> How weak is it to say that you need to recognize a toolbar before /and/ after enhancement.
[14:19:05] <gabrielschulhof> ?
[14:19:13] <gabrielschulhof> i.e., data-ui-role="toolbar"
[14:19:38] <gabrielschulhof> So, .ui-toolbar-header,[data-ui-role='toolbar']
[14:19:39] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: scope issue you are calling this._removeClass inside a .one handler
[14:19:40] <cgack> you mean, don't look for the class, but for the attr
[14:19:48] <arschmitz> and this is not the widget
[14:19:51] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Look for both.
[14:19:53] <apsdehal1> Oh, I will fix that
[14:19:57] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: I mean either.
[14:20:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: that seems right
[14:20:28] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: that might work, any gaps to worry about there...  probably not
[14:20:34] <apsdehal1> I will upgrade tests also to catch that one
[14:20:40] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: <div></div> doesn't tell you anything, but then you can claim that, "Well, dummy, indicate in /some/ way that it's gonna be a toolbar!"
[14:20:50] <arschmitz> cgack: only someone manually calling .toolbar too late
[14:21:01] <arschmitz> at which point we say you need to call it earlier
[14:21:08] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Those people should also call panel.
[14:21:14] <cgack> arschmitz: they should handle that manually themselves i'd guess
[14:21:14] <arschmitz> yes
[14:21:14] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: We can't recognize everything.
[14:21:36] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: cgack: thats my point there is a gap but its not up to us to fill
[14:21:48] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, I see. Yeah. I agree.
[14:22:00] <arschmitz> might be worth documenting though
[14:22:10] <cgack> cool gabrielschulhof arschmitz i'll work on it that way and figure it out to at least get what we know working properly
[14:22:14] <jasperdegroot> panel --> complicated :(
[14:22:27] <cgack> arschmitz: for sure... jasperdegroot indeed
[14:22:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah i still have the simple panel re write somewhere
[14:22:51] <arschmitz> but that depends on pep
[14:22:52] <jasperdegroot> I don't understand why this wasn't an issue before
[14:23:05] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: right, I remember that
[14:23:22] <cgack> jasperdegroot: I said the same thing to arschmitz in a PM.  I think we have just been lucky with timings
[14:23:24] <arschmitz> so this worked before because order was a bit different
[14:23:33] <arschmitz> it was never guranteed
[14:23:40] <arschmitz> but the order did change with new enhancer
[14:23:57] <jasperdegroot> cgack: did you hard code the new class names when you updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L107-L124 ?
[14:24:17] <jasperdegroot> or did you try to get them from the toolbar classes option?
[14:24:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: apsdehal1 did that one
[14:24:39] <jasperdegroot> ah right, sorry
[14:24:44] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Well, in the distributed jquery.mobile.js, they're probably in the right order. So, timing in the sense of at the time jquery.mobile.js was rendered.
[14:24:46] <cgack> jasperdegroot: i still have to add the new classnames there to fix the issue
[14:25:05] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/js/widgets/panel.js#L152
[14:25:32] <cgack> but they will likely be hardcoded. the link there should be ui-toolbar-header... ect
[14:26:35] <cgack> can we appropriately handle classnames build for toolbar outside of the pre-defined names?
[14:26:36] <jasperdegroot> we can't hardcode them
[14:26:51] <jasperdegroot> I mean, it would be wrong
[14:27:16] <jasperdegroot> maybe the panel classes option should include toolbar classes
[14:27:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no
[14:27:34] <jasperdegroot> so if you change class names in toolbar you also have to change them in panel
[14:27:36] <arschmitz> they should be hardcoded
[14:27:39] <arschmitz> no
[14:27:43] <arschmitz> thats not how classes works
[14:27:51] <arschmitz> classes always applies the structure class
[14:27:54] <arschmitz> you have no choice
[14:28:03] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[14:28:03] <arschmitz> you cn only change theme classes
[14:28:10] <jasperdegroot> understood
[14:28:38] <jasperdegroot> then we can simply hardcode them in panel.js
[14:28:57] <arschmitz> yeah they are now already it looks like
[14:29:59] <cgack> plus since we are going to be looking for both classnames and data-role=toolbar, we should be golden
[14:30:08] <arschmitz> yes
[14:30:20] <arschmitz> we need both for the case its called manually without data-attributes
[14:30:27] <arschmitz> so that should cover all cases we care about
[14:31:30] <cgack> I think so. thanks everyone
[14:32:38] <arschmitz> so i didnt get to demos test fails yet since im still stuck on table
[14:32:50] <arschmitz> have to get that figured out so we can merge
[14:33:05] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: any progress on selecmenu
[14:33:08] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[14:33:17] <gabrielschulhof> I actually found some blunders I'd introduced.
[14:33:29] <gabrielschulhof> Like, the list was being copied into the header, because both now have .ui-content
[14:33:39] <arschmitz> ah
[14:33:50] <arschmitz> yeah i hadnt done any demo testing yet just basic code review
[14:33:52] <gabrielschulhof> ... and pagecontainer is full of .jqmData(), which is not good.
[14:34:02] <arschmitz> oh that reminds me
[14:34:14] <arschmitz> i have ot land the pagecontainer classes PR still!
[14:34:16] <gabrielschulhof> ... and it was not recognizing dialogs correctly.
[14:34:19] <arschmitz> i noticed it still open
[14:34:26] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, wow! OK ... is that mine?
[14:34:31] <arschmitz> no
[14:34:34] <gabrielschulhof> I think it was yours, right?
[14:34:34] <arschmitz> i took it over
[14:34:37] <arschmitz> its both
[14:34:40] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[14:34:47] <arschmitz> i finished a semi related pr you had and added classes
[14:34:59] <gabrielschulhof> It'd be nice to rebase on top of that.
[14:35:06] <arschmitz> yeah i think it was done
[14:35:15] <arschmitz> or just had a minor change you commented
[14:35:20] <arschmitz> i need to go back and get it landed
[14:36:40] <arschmitz> ill make sure to do that this week
[14:36:46] <arschmitz> so you can base selectmenu off it
[14:37:01] <arschmitz> looks like some simple review stuff but looks like iv pushed since
[14:37:10] <arschmitz> so just need to make sure i addressed everything
[14:37:14] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8261
[14:38:06] <arschmitz> ok and i have one last thing
[14:38:21] <arschmitz> right now 1.4.5 breaks on latest core
[14:38:30] <arschmitz> should we do a 1.4.6 to fix it
[14:38:37] <arschmitz> we have fixes in 1.5-dev
[14:38:49] <arschmitz> we would have to look into cherry-picking them and how much work it would be
[14:39:02] <gabrielschulhof> ... or just do a branch ...
[14:39:19] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: what do you mean?
[14:39:42] <cgack> what all breaks core? I'm of the opinion to just move to 1.5 asap
[14:39:44] <gabrielschulhof> We shouldn't reorder 1.5-dev so the fixes are at the bottom and then rebase onto master.
[14:39:54] <arschmitz> no
[14:40:02] <arschmitz> thats why we have 1.4 stable branch
[14:40:08] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, right! We have that.
[14:40:13] <arschmitz> if we did a 1.4.6 it would be off that
[14:40:21] <arschmitz> with the fixes just cherry-picked
[14:40:38] <arschmitz> cgack: i agree this would not be a blocker for 1.5
[14:40:40] <gabrielschulhof> Wow! Have I ever forgotten how we used to do things :)
[14:40:45] <arschmitz> and may even come after that
[14:41:10] <arschmitz> but there are major ( though mostly backcompatible ) changes in 1.5
[14:41:17] <arschmitz> and people may not want to upgrade
[14:41:26] <arschmitz> ui has always done this
[14:41:42] <arschmitz> we dont have to i just wanted to discuss if we should
[14:42:45] <jasperdegroot> maybe do 1.5 beta first and then  a 1.4.6 release
[14:42:55] <arschmitz> that would be fine
[14:43:00] <gabrielschulhof> Well, we've uprooted a lot of stuff in 1.5, so I guess it'd make sense to retain a non-broken 1.4.x.
[14:43:17] <arschmitz> that was kinda my thought
[14:43:53] <gabrielschulhof> We literally just need to make sure it doesn't break against core as it rolls forward.
[14:44:00] <arschmitz> right
[14:44:08] <arschmitz> in theory it should me minimal effort
[14:44:20] <arschmitz> just cherry pick a few commits just need to track down the right onw
[14:44:46] <jasperdegroot> we can cherry pick them once 1.5-dev is merged into master
[14:44:55] <arschmitz> yes
[14:44:59] <jasperdegroot> then you have a better overview of all the 1.5 commits anyway
[14:45:02] <cgack> i'm down with that
[14:45:29] <arschmitz> ok so we will plan on doing that
[14:45:30] <jasperdegroot> easier to find the once that need to be cherry-picked into 1.4-stable
[14:45:36] <arschmitz> but it wont be until after beta
[14:45:40] <jasperdegroot> sounds good
[14:48:06] <arschmitz> ok thats all  i have on the agenda for oday
[14:48:18] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else
[14:49:13] <apsdehal1> Is there anything in demos that I can help with to speed up the process?
[14:49:34] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal1: yes, sure
[14:50:08] <arschmitz> yes look at the failing tests
[14:50:09] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal1:  see the checklist here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8245
[14:50:12] <arschmitz> for demos on that branch
[14:50:22] <arschmitz> the paths are some how all wrong
[14:50:37] <arschmitz> thats holding up all the demos changes
[14:50:38] <apsdehal1> Ok, I will look into them.
[14:50:52] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: those use spider.js a lib of mine so ping me with any questions
[14:50:55] <jasperdegroot> great!
[14:51:05] <arschmitz> but its a build issue not a issue with the lib as far as i can tell
[14:53:51] <arschmitz> ok anything else today?
[14:54:58] <gabrielschulhof> I'm good ...
[14:55:31] <cgack> i'm good too
[14:56:09] <apsdehal1> I'm also good
[14:56:21] <arschmitz> ok
[14:56:26] <arschmitz> lets call it a wrap then
[14:56:33] <gabrielschulhof> L8R all!
[14:56:46] <arschmitz> thank you every one
[14:57:13] <cogwurx> have a great week!
