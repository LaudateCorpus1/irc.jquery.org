[09:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone!
[09:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden, gnarf: Any infra updates pertaining to us?
[09:05:13] <gnarf> not ui specifically, but I'd like to talk to you about where we are with getting some content into at least one or two of these staging domains
[09:05:20] <gnarf> after meeting is fine
[09:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> Which sites are currently staged?
[09:08:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the jq01.stage.jquery.com box has a list, lemme fish it up for you
[09:09:03] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/8573dfe0ebeec6b0711e
[09:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well we're definitely interested in *.jqueryui.com :-)
[09:10:41] <gnarf> sure
[09:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> After the meeting works for me.
[09:10:56] <gnarf> I'm not sure where nacin is on the setup, it seems some stuff is still hardcoded
[09:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> Firt pass at the new node-wordpress is done.
[09:11:37] <gnarf> nice
[09:11:40] <scott_gonzalez> It's all XML-RPC.
[09:11:59] <nacin> gnarf: It's all ready to be moved back into puppet, I think.
[09:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to add some sugar on top of the API though.
[09:12:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: at some point, I'd like to get this setup on another staging box with the auto-pull from git etc
[09:12:33] <gnarf> so we can watch changes to jqueryui.com git repo update staging
[09:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: you around?
[09:12:57] <gnarf> i still need to get whatever script dan had started for this
[09:12:59] <rworth> yeah
[09:13:13] <gnarf> unless anyone else has a cool post-commit hook script
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, how about the 3 (4?) of us get together after the meeting and figure out what the next steps are for jqueryui.com
[09:13:39] <gnarf> but i think danheberden had crafted a decent one in node
[09:14:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: Sure
[09:14:27] <danheberden> sry late
[09:14:33] <rworth> scott_gonzalez like on skype?
[09:15:00] <gnarf> I'm sitting in the middle of 3 other dudes working in a bullpen, but could move into the other room for a skype call
[09:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> Skype works
[09:15:53] <rworth> sorry I'm late too, what topic are we on?
[09:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> Just finishing infrastrcture.
[09:16:25] <danheberden> also the "why are rworth and danheberden late?" topic
[09:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what's going on with TestSwarm. I think we should just ignore it for now.
[09:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> There's someone connected with a bad Chrome.
[09:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> And then there's the intermittent IE error.
[09:17:28] <Krinkle> will be fixed hopefully in TestSwarm 1.0.0
[09:17:39] <gnarf> hey Krinkle
[09:17:53] <Krinkle> which will no longer have a * Chrome, but actually check the version
[09:17:54] <Krinkle> sorry, I got beeped by the /testswarm/ mention
[09:18:04] <rworth> awesome news Krinkle
[09:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: The problem isn't the version.
[09:18:20] <Krinkle> although I ^^
[09:18:30] <Krinkle> indeed, the bad Chrome client uses 18
[09:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that it's a real person, not a VM, and the window isn't active.
[09:18:37] <Krinkle> weird
[09:18:50] <Krinkle> well, then TestSwarm 1.0.0 will stick fix it :D
[09:19:01] <Krinkle> since it'll feature a run-token so that we can deny public access
[09:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:19:15] <gnarf> Krinkle: hrm
[09:19:15] <Krinkle> which we can do now that we have  browserstack, we can close the crowd sourcing
[09:19:16] <rworth> :)
[09:19:21] <gnarf> feature request idea
[09:19:33] <gnarf> is there a way to know which "user" is running the bad chrome?
[09:19:38] <Krinkle> it is an optional configuration option in TestSwarm 1.0.0, already landed in master, disabled by default
[09:19:57] <Krinkle> gnarf: Yes, but 0.2.0 broke that (regression), it is fixed in 1.0.0
[09:20:15] <gnarf> because it might be nice to just flag that user as broken and send him to a "fix your browser and let us know" type of page :)
[09:20:17] <Krinkle> you can do it now, but will need db manual lookup
[09:20:35] <Krinkle> click run results link, check client_id, and look it up via the clients table which user id, and then get that from the users table
[09:21:01] <gnarf> Krinkle: but without a way to "blacklist" that client_id - it doesn't mean much
[09:21:01] <gnarf> :)
[09:21:26] <Krinkle> I'll execute my previous reply, don't let me hold up the meeting :)
[09:21:54] <Krinkle> (jzaefferer granted me jqadmin ssh access on swarm.jq.o so I can do that)
[09:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok, moving on to the build process
[09:22:15] <scott_gonzalez> We finished the js lint cleanup.
[09:22:24] <gnarf> ?hi5 scott_gonzalez
[09:22:26] <bot-t> gnarf, Couldn't find "hi5 scott_gonzalez" in jQuery Docs.
[09:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer added HTML lint (Thanks to Mike Smith from W3C)
[09:22:31] * gnarf frowns
[09:22:45] <rworth> yay
[09:22:50] <gnarf> nice
[09:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> HTML lint runs a local copy of validator.nu :-)
[09:23:07] <gnarf> so how much lint did we clean up?
[09:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> And it's available as a grunt plugin.
[09:23:10] <gnarf> :)
[09:23:14] <rworth> that's a local copy of a living validator ;)
[09:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> A lot :-)
[09:23:27] <gnarf> i've got a question about grunt
[09:23:40] <gnarf> i noticed that i needed to npm install stuff
[09:23:53] <gnarf> to get grunt running some tasks
[09:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> Some of our tasks use grunt plugins, which are npm modules.
[09:24:13] <gnarf> can we write a "grunt grunt" that does that?
[09:24:24] <rworth> like a bootstrap?
[09:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> How is that better than `npm install`?
[09:24:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, like if i were to automate a download/build of jquery
[09:24:53] <gnarf> or jquery-ui
[09:24:55] <gnarf> or any project
[09:25:10] <gnarf> it would be nice to not have to know which grunt plugins i need to npm install in each folder
[09:25:20] <gnarf> and just be able to run "grunt grunt" and know that it keeps itself up today
[09:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> git clone ...; npm install; grunt
[09:25:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it detects automagically?
[09:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> with a cd in there :-P
[09:25:39] <gnarf> wtf npm magic
[09:25:47] <gnarf> nevermind then
[09:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, npm install with no args means install the required packages :-)
[09:25:53] <gnarf> im just ignorant of npm
[09:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[09:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron and jzaefferer worked together to move the compare
[09:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> compare_size task into a plugin
[09:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> So jquery and jquery-ui are able to share the code.
[09:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> I also moved the jshint configs into .jshintrc files.
[09:27:38] <rworth> and I'm working with rwaldron to make sure it runs on Windows
[09:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> I also suggested to ben_alman that grunt should have built-in support for .jshintrc https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/issues/141
[09:28:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #141 on grunt (scottgonzalez; 5d, 53m ago): Lint task should hook into .jshintrc files
[09:28:25] <Krinkle> (btw, guys, fyi, it is not just Chrome. the "dimensions" module test suite really is broken in 12 places in all browsers)
[09:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: That's core, no UI :-P
[09:28:49] <Krinkle> There is a bad Chrome, yes, but there is also a genuine breakage
[09:29:00] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: so ?
[09:29:33] <Krinkle> the bad Chrome affects both in testswarm
[09:29:46] <Krinkle> Oh ,this is a UI meeting
[09:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but it's not on the list of things we're concened with.
[09:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:30:01] <Krinkle> okay, I never attend these things, sorry :D
[09:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> heh, no problem
[09:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok, on to docs
[09:30:23] * Krinkle reads topic and stfu :| ;-)
[09:30:45] <rworth> so, most of the progress of late is happening in the new api.jquery.com repo
[09:30:51] <rworth> but it will soon make its way into ui docs
[09:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Let's meet sometime this week to go over the migration to node-wordpress.
[09:31:01] <rworth> I added grunt to api.jquery.com
[09:31:05] <rworth> it does an xmllint
[09:31:20] <rworth> I'm working on adding xsltproc to do a local build of html files for local preview
[09:31:42] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: sounds good. I just saw your commit. You gonna bump ver and push to npm?
[09:31:43] <scott_gonzalez> I assume a lot of the logic will be duplicated in both repos?
[09:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> ALREADY DONE!
[09:32:36] <rworth> oh, I looked but missed it
[09:32:58] <rworth> ummm, I haven't really considered that yet, but only because I didn't want to, not because you're not right
[09:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably be aware of it so that we can find a good way not to actually duplicate the logic.
[09:33:34] <rworth> yeah
[09:33:57] <rworth> maybe it'll end up be via grunt tasks
[09:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can always wait until we move to UI to deal with it.
[09:34:05] <rworth> s/be/being/
[09:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> That could work.
[09:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.19 was released last week.
[09:35:38] <rworth> first grunt release - yay
[09:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately there was an issue with the @VERSION replacement and only some of them got replaced.
[09:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that it seems to have gone pretty well.
[09:36:03] <scott_gonzalez> I've fixed the @VERSION replacement already.
[09:36:07] <rworth> three cheers for ben_alman?
[09:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> ?eval hi5("ben_alman")
[09:36:53] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez: "ben_alman"
[09:37:02] * scott_gonzalez has no idea how bot-t works.
[09:37:07] <rworth> haha
[09:37:13] <rworth> ?hi5 ben_alman
[09:37:15] <bot-t> rworth, Couldn't find "hi5 ben_alman" in jQuery Docs.
[09:37:22] <ben_alman> heh
[09:37:28] * rworth has no better idea how bot-t works
[09:37:28] <gnarf> ?js hi5("ben_alman","scott_gonzalez")
[09:37:29] <bot-t> gnarf: "ben_alman _o/\o_ scott_gonzalez"
[09:37:35] <gnarf> ?hi5 @rworth
[09:37:35] <bot-t> rworth, ⋰⁵⋱
[09:37:41] * rworth bows to gnarf
[09:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I finished the position feedback changes.
[09:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> So the position API updates are done.
[09:38:41] <rworth> schweet
[09:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> If you haven't seem the visual tests:
[09:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/position/position_feedback.html
[09:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/position/position_feedback_rotate.html
[09:38:52] <gnarf> ?js hi5.apply( hi5, team=["rworth scott_gonzalez gnarf jzaefferer ajpiano ben_alman Krinkle"].split(" ") );
[09:38:52] <bot-t> gnarf: TypeError: ["rworth scott_gonzalez gnarf jzaefferer ajpiano ben_alman Krinkle"].split is not a function
[09:38:56] <gnarf> oops
[09:39:04] <gnarf> ?facepalm
[09:39:05] <bot-t> gnarf, Couldn't find "facepalm" in jQuery Docs.
[09:39:09] <ben_alman> i hope to see a blog post about grunt at some point in the future
[09:39:13] <rworth> oh, rotate is too awesome
[09:39:18] <ben_alman> wait until at least 0.4.0 tho :D
[09:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: sounds good
[09:39:47] <rworth> indeed
[09:40:47] <Krinkle> Okay, I found the guilty user. There is about 3-4 different client session IDs but all belong to user id 2881 [ 2881, wmchristie, since: 2012-03-21 ]
[09:40:51] <Krinkle> does anyone know that user?
[09:41:20] <Krinkle> (re testswarm bad chrome in jq ui)
[09:41:52] <gnarf> this position stuff seems nice
[09:42:02] <gnarf> and afk a min
[09:42:23] <gnarf> gonna move the laptop into the hallway, which without a battery takes some effort
[09:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> I also landed some improvements to our unit tests.
[09:43:39] <scott_gonzalez> The tests will now run JSHint (in your browser!), so no excuses for lint errors :-P
[09:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's currently only implemented for widgets, but I'll be adding it to all plugins soon.
[09:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> I also exposed our boolean options in the QUnit banner.
[09:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> So that people know they exist.
[09:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> For example, I don't think anyone besides gnarf and I knew about the min option.
[09:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> Which will run the test against a build instead of the source files.
[09:45:46] <rworth> awesome
[09:46:00] <rworth> what about linting script tags, I saw some mention of that idea?
[09:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone wants to take a stab at that, go ahead :-)
[09:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that any tools currently exist for that.
[09:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> It shouldn't be too hard to implement though.
[09:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> Since you don't actually need to parse the HTML, you can use regex.
[09:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm 99% certain that statement is true.
[09:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> I believe parsing for <script> is the only time you don't need a parser.
[09:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps <style> as well.
[09:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm probably wrong because of things like <textarea><script>...
[09:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> ANYWAY
[09:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything on the agenda.
[09:49:52] <rworth> cool
[09:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:50:08] <rworth> is the roadmap up-to-date?
[09:50:16] <rworth> I saw an update recently on position
[09:50:31] <rworth> but I wondered about plugis that used to be in master but got moved out
[09:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:50:55] <rworth> are they not on the roadmap for that reason? Should they be potentially in 1.10 or do we now know, and that's why?
[09:51:26] <rworth> s/now/not/
[09:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably put menubar in 1.10.
[09:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose that's a question for jzaefferer/kborchers.
[09:52:15] <rworth> which was the other. Popup?
[09:52:26] <rworth> (also not on the roadmap)
[09:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I don't know what the status of popup is.
[09:52:51] <rworth> ok, we'll ask jzaefferer another time then
[09:52:54] <rworth> I guess that's it
[09:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, gnarf what happened with SineSwiper?
[09:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> Did you get back to him about clip?
[09:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> We could definitely use his help on bug fixes and effects rewrites while you're busy with infra.
[09:54:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I haven't no - I'll put it on my list
[09:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Skype call after rworth eats lunch?
[09:56:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sure
