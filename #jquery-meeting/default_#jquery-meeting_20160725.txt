[08:06:36] <jzaefferer> there
[08:06:43] <flore77> Hi
[08:06:43] <jzaefferer> hello flore77 to another js-reporters meeting
[08:07:30] <jzaefferer> agenda/minutes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dq_2Asse7r7598WV2khJnbXf1KQ2tkEWtJiuBhzJ63Q/edit#
[08:07:36] <flore77> should I start to speak about last week?
[08:07:41] <jzaefferer> yes please
[08:08:20] <flore77> the most important facr of last week
[08:08:40] <flore77> is that or pr against browserstackk was accepted and merged
[08:09:04] <jzaefferer> yeah, and we have a new contact there
[08:09:17] <flore77> yes, which is cool
[08:09:34] <flore77> I will have a new pr soon after we make a new release
[08:09:36] <jzaefferer> so its a little bit disappointing that it was merged without any review comments. Makes it seem like there wasn't much effort in reviewing it
[08:10:03] <flore77> yeah, I think they know you
[08:10:11] <flore77> and you supervised this
[08:10:42] <jzaefferer> and I guess the new developer isn't really familiar with the code base
[08:10:48] <flore77> so they assumed that it is ok
[08:11:04] <flore77> could be
[08:11:43] <jzaefferer> we even have more good news
[08:12:05] <flore77> anyway I think it is really great that we have a production integration
[08:12:12] <flore77> yes indeed
[08:12:20] <flore77> I contacted boneskull from Mocha
[08:12:38] <jzaefferer> Christoph Hiller, right? We should tell him about this meeting
[08:12:42] <flore77> and he is really interested in integrating the js-reporters standard into Mocha
[08:12:52] <flore77> yes
[08:13:06] <flore77> maybe from next time?
[08:13:38] <jzaefferer> I still need to upload meetings notes to http://meetings.jquery.org/ - I'll try to do that today, afterwards you could send him the link to the previous meeting notes, our running document and the time and place
[08:13:59] <flore77> ok
[08:14:22] <jzaefferer> Apparently I don't have access to the jQuery calendar though, so I can't add it there
[08:14:50] <flore77> neither the notes?
[08:15:22] <jzaefferer> I can add the notes
[08:15:40] <flore77> that's ok
[08:15:49] <jzaefferer> I'll find someone with access to the calendar
[08:16:10] <flore77> ok
[08:16:35] <flore77> last week, i also finished the fullName prop
[08:16:52] <flore77> implemantation, which was also merged
[08:17:28] <jzaefferer> Missing in https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters#event-data
[08:17:41] <flore77> yes
[08:17:55] <flore77> I want to finish the adding of the assertions property
[08:18:03] <jzaefferer> We can address that as part of https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/30#issuecomment-234937369
[08:18:04] <flore77> assertions normalizing
[08:18:36] <flore77> yes and then i want to address this issue
[08:19:10] <flore77> as also: https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/27
[08:20:59] <flore77> and then would be left only the test emitting order issue
[08:21:16] <flore77> which is nothing to implement, it would be more like a discussion
[08:21:20] <jzaefferer> Let's ping boneskull on that issue
[08:21:40] <flore77> on tests emitting order?
[08:21:48] <jzaefferer> yeah
[08:21:54] <flore77> ok, sounds legit
[08:22:13] <flore77> I wiant to focus on closing all this issues this week
[08:22:18] <flore77> want*
[08:22:54] <flore77> this way the standard will be complete and from next week to start working on qunit integration
[08:23:29] <flore77> I contacted the qunit team, but I am still waitimg for an answer
[08:24:55] <jzaefferer> I commented on the QUnit PR today. With the work in progress on turning code into ES6 modules, we may have to wait a little longer, or help with that
[08:25:14] <jzaefferer> Have you made progress on your project summary page (like a blog post)?
[08:28:44] <flore77> I created a blog on wordpress, i didn't have one
[08:29:02] <flore77> but I didn't start writing anything yet
[08:29:27] <flore77> should there be only one blog post? or they could be multiple?
[08:29:31] <jzaefferer> okay. Can you start a draft this week, collecting relevant links for now?
[08:29:43] <flore77> yes
[08:29:47] <jzaefferer> It needs to be one URL. That one can have plenty links
[08:30:02] <flore77> ok
[08:30:49] <flore77> I think that's it
[08:31:11] <flore77> the project seems to go somewhere now :)
[08:31:13] <jzaefferer> Alright, thanks. I'll try to publish those notes
[08:31:28] <flore77> yes, ping me on telegram when done
[08:31:37] <flore77> so i can contact boneskull
[08:31:38] <jzaefferer> Btw. on API design questions, we can also ping @searls
[08:31:50] <jzaefferer> like tests emitting order
[08:32:08] <flore77> yes, we could, but I think now on the normalizing assertions issue
[08:32:13] <flore77> we have quite finished
[08:33:09] <flore77> I will ping both on the test emitting order issue
[12:02:38] <timmywil> lost track of time
[12:03:29] <m_gol> :)
[12:04:00] <m_gol> timmywil: do we start?
[12:05:04] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, jbedard, m_gol https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhcW9_TlSwD8JnO1_HNnSYJAriTK9WYZ8uQNDvtAAhA/edit
[12:05:12] <timmywil> gibson needs to miss the meeting today
[12:05:26] <timmywil> but said he'd have a patch for the selector issue this week
[12:05:58] <DaveMethvin> here
[12:06:25] <timmywil> 3.1.1 is priority. I've got 4 issues, but this week is busy at work.
[12:06:59] <timmywil> I could probably knock out 2930
[12:07:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah i need to get to mine this week, will do
[12:08:05] <timmywil> Did anyone happen to get to the periodic jobs for custom builds?
[12:08:43] <m_gol> not yet
[12:09:08] <m_gol> I'll report an issue to infra
[12:09:39] <timmywil> Not sure what happened to this PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1612
[12:11:16] <m_gol> sounds like a hijacked account or sth
[12:11:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's strange
[12:12:28] <timmywil> I reported to github
[12:12:58] <timmywil> Ok, I can't think of a lot to add. We covered most of it last week.
[12:12:58] <DaveMethvin> can one of you take a quick look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/212
[12:13:25] <DaveMethvin> i can start the deprecation work for 3.2 once that's in place
[12:13:43] <m_gol> LGTM
[12:13:49] <timmywil> ok
[12:13:54] <DaveMethvin> cool, thanks
[12:14:13] <DaveMethvin> alright then all that we need to do  now is do the work :)
[12:14:30] <timmywil> yup
[12:14:31] <m_gol> in the future you might want to make newFunc optional, maybe
[12:14:41] <m_gol> so that it just warns & invokes the original one
[12:14:49] <m_gol> but we'll see if it's really needed
[12:14:59] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i was thinking about that but as of 3.0 i think we always fill
[12:15:09] <DaveMethvin> and don't depend on the functionality being there
[12:15:15] <m_gol> you'd have to swap argument order then :)
[12:15:15] <DaveMethvin> but i would be good with that
[12:15:17] <m_gol> yeah
[12:15:22] <m_gol> that's true
[12:15:26] <DaveMethvin> no, you could pass in the existing one, right?
[12:15:36] <m_gol> even if we didn't alias, we'd still copy the source
[12:15:53] <DaveMethvin> i'll play with it
[12:16:00] <DaveMethvin> i can take https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3226
[12:16:29] <timmywil> we might get a patch from huguoliang1314, but I doubt it
[12:16:43] <timmywil> thanks
[12:16:46] <timmywil> anything to add?
[12:16:50] <DaveMethvin> nothing here
[12:16:51] <timmywil> light meeting
[12:16:59] <timmywil> thanks all
