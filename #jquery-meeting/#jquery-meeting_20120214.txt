[09:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Any infra stuff that needs to be discussed?
[09:02:30] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez not particularly
[09:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> I've made some more progress on the accordion animations
[09:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/587
[09:02:54] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (2w, 3h ago): Accordion: Attempt at improving animation.
[09:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> If heightStyle != "content" then we force the height on the accordion.
[09:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> That prevents content below for shuffling during animation if the browser STILL can't get the dimensions right.
[09:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> I also came up with a new API for the animations, with help from ajpiano
[09:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> animated: false => no animation
[09:04:49] <scott_gonzalez> animated: easingName => defined easing, default duration
[09:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> animated: duration => default easing, defined duration
[09:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> animated: { easing: easingName, duration: duration } => defined easing, defined duration
[09:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> animated: { easing ..., duration: ..., down: { easing: ... duration: ... } } => different animation for "up" and "down"
[09:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> down = activating a panel with a lower index than the currently active index.
[09:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> You can see an example of that with the existing animated: bounceslide option
[09:07:02] <scott_gonzalez> For down, you can also specify just an easing or a duration and it will inherit the other value from the up animation.
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'll take silence as everything thinking the new API is amazing.
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> *everyone
[09:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> In which case I'll add the back-compat layer and finally get this into master :-)
[09:09:50] * scott_gonzalez realizes that I'm a day early on this meeting...
