[09:01:06] <jzaefferer> meeting time
[09:01:30] <jzaefferer> danheberden or clarkbox around?
[09:02:25] <gnarf> i spoke with clark about view
[09:02:30] <gnarf> so he knows what we want
[09:02:43] <gnarf> dan pointed him my way
[09:03:46] <jzaefferer> he's got access to the repo, right?
[09:03:50] <gnarf> yah
[09:04:03] <gnarf> i think he has access to ssh there too
[09:04:03] <jzaefferer> k
[09:04:44] <jzaefferer> okay, we'll see
[09:05:17] <jzaefferer> what's up with the effects schema for docs?
[09:05:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf?
[09:06:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can ya add a link to the widget factory docs?
[09:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs/
[09:06:47] <gnarf> i didn't really go over it yet apologies, if this is stalled on me i'll put it on the top of the list
[09:07:03] <jzaefferer> docs aren't moving much anyway
[09:07:20] <gnarf> i figured i had a week or two to figure that out
[09:08:12] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did anything come out from Richard's work? he mentioned working on widget docs
[09:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> he did a few updates on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[09:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> but nothing in the new docs
[09:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page-revisions/compare/12138135/Widget%20factory?rev2=1318276567&rev1=1311185468
[09:09:06] <jzaefferer> okay, that's not very useful?
[09:09:13] <jzaefferer> how do these two overlap?
[09:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> the new docs completely replace the wiki page
[09:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> plus a lot more
[09:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> but they're not fully written yet :-P
[09:10:53] <jzaefferer> seems like new docs don't have anything on the internal methods, like _setOption
[09:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> How jQuery UI Works is mostly done: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs/blob/master/how-jquery-ui-works.md
[09:11:29] <scott_gonzalez> that's in How to Use the Widget Factory, which isn't written yet
[09:12:21] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> so far I've been the only one working on the docs
[09:12:37] <jzaefferer> that's also where we'd document new stuff like _bind, right?
[09:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:12:52] <jzaefferer> why is this on your private account?
[09:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> because it's a very temporary repo
[09:14:22] <jzaefferer> shouldn't stop us from putting it on the jquery account
[09:14:39] <jzaefferer> that way more people have access by default (and can give access)
[09:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> that's not an issue
[09:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> and I can't imagine it becoming an issue
[09:15:16] <jzaefferer> dunno if it would be more discoverable
[09:15:19] <jzaefferer> anyway
[09:15:36] <jzaefferer> I can give the how it worky it a shot
[09:15:51] <jzaefferer> looks like I already have write access :p
[09:16:30] <jzaefferer> would should the filename be?
[09:16:47] <jzaefferer> how-to-use-the-widget-factory.md?
[09:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> it's already mostly covered by http://blog.nemikor.com/2010/05/15/building-stateful-jquery-plugins/
[09:18:31] <jzaefferer> should we start with that?
[09:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> the plan was to mostly migrate that over
[09:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> the intro of that post is already covered in much more detail in the other docs
[09:20:01] <jzaefferer> oh well
[09:20:10] <jzaefferer> I'll start just making a list of all the internal methods
[09:20:14] <jzaefferer> like _bind
[09:20:21] <gnarf> speaking of
[09:20:27] <gnarf> should we think about using _on ?
[09:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: the docs should not look like the bottom half of the current wiki page
[09:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yes
[09:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7795
[09:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> we should also really close that ticket as a duplicate of the _bind ticket, since _bind was never released
[09:22:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, is there something specific I can write?
[09:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: what do you mean by something specific?
[09:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> it should read as a tutorial, not an API listing
[09:24:16] <jzaefferer> is there a reasonable way to convert your blog post to markdown, at least as a starting point?
[09:24:34] <gnarf> yeah, copy the html
[09:24:38] <gnarf> html still works in markdown
[09:24:39] <gnarf> :)
[09:24:41] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:25:07] <paul_irish> http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try
[09:25:49] <gnarf> paul_irish: thats hot
[09:28:02] <jzaefferer> looks like I can use that to import Scott's post
[09:30:24] <gnarf> animation testing is still no updates, i have some notes, but need to just do it one of these days
[09:30:53] <jzaefferer> what's up with that position PR
[09:30:55] <jzaefferer> ?
[09:30:57] <gnarf> should that testswarm note from up above come down to the testing section?
[09:31:16] <jzaefferer> ah, its merged
[09:31:32] <jzaefferer> after Scott asking for a visual test page
[09:31:36] <jzaefferer> kborchers scott_gonzalez?
[09:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> didn't realize kborchers had merged it
[09:32:55] <kborchers> I did?
[09:33:03] <kborchers> Sorry in another meeting right now
[09:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub says you did
[09:33:39] <gnarf> jqbug.com/ui/p740
[09:34:01] <gnarf> wow
[09:34:05] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/470
[09:34:06] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (3w, 4d ago): Position: Added a check for fraction support in element positions
[09:34:23] <gnarf>  kborchers merged commit 4c218ee into jquery:1-8-stable from kborchers:1-8-stable about 11 hours ago
[09:34:44] <kborchers> Not sure how that happened
[09:34:52] <kborchers> It says merged 0 commits
[09:35:07] <jzaefferer> eh?
[09:35:53] <kborchers> At the top of that page but then it says the commit was merged at the bottom
[09:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh, weird
[09:36:41] <kborchers> I never did anything with 1-8-stable, just some pushes to master
[09:36:59] <gnarf> hrm
[09:37:08] <gnarf> did your local 1-8-stable lose that commit?
[09:37:13] <gnarf> did you reset it or something?
[09:37:20] <gnarf> cuz you had your fix on top of 1-8-stable
[09:37:27] <gnarf> instead of its own branch
[09:37:37] <kborchers> Hmmm, I'll have to check after my meeting
[09:39:16] <kborchers> Those changes are not in the actual file so I must have reset and then it broke like gnarf said
[09:40:43] <jzaefferer> can't reopen PRs, so needs a new one
[09:41:09] <kborchers> I'll do that later this afternoon and ask for that test page again
[09:43:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what's the status of the interactions rewrite?
[09:43:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf and I did a review of the code
[09:43:51] <jzaefferer> I'm following Dave Stein on Twitter now, but haven't seen him in irc a lot
[09:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> it's coming along pretty well
[09:43:55] <jzaefferer> if at all
[09:43:57] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> let me find our review
[09:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/pull/2
[09:44:58] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (4d, 22h ago): Draggable: Cleanup.
[09:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> there are some next steps in a comment
[09:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> also updated it to use _bind: https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/pull/3/files
[09:45:38] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (4d, 21h ago): Draggable: Use ._bind().
[09:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> then we had a conference call with him
[09:46:00] <scott_gonzalez> to go over everything
[09:46:07] <gnarf> that was part 2 of the review
[09:46:16] <gnarf> he pulled https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/pull/2/files
[09:46:17] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (4d, 22h ago): Draggable: Cleanup.
[09:46:46] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> right now it handles all types of positioning, scrolling when you hit the edge, modifying position in drag event
[09:46:53] <scott_gonzalez> helpers
[09:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> true = clone, fn = custom helper
[09:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> definitely a good start
[09:47:53] <jzaefferer> how does the modifying work?
[09:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> ui.position in the event
[09:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> contains top and left properties, you can change them to anything you want
[09:48:20] <jzaefferer> is the redesign doc anywhere?
[09:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> just our initial notes, nothing final
[09:48:46] <jzaefferer> that's what you use to implement grid, contains etc.?
[09:49:00] <jzaefferer> notes are fine
[09:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:49:54] <scott_gonzalez> I can update the planning wiki
[09:50:20] <jzaefferer> k
[09:50:28] <jzaefferer> as for selectmenu, thats also moving along, still missing unit tests; I'll create the basic structure, maybe that helps moving forward with them
[09:53:31] <jzaefferer> as for tabs, scott_gonzalez I doubt that Hans will have much time to merge his version with master, wanna check his keybinding code and try to land it in master?
[09:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:56:04] <jzaefferer> he's got two tabs branches: https://github.com/hanshillen/jquery-ui/commits/tabs-hh-keyboard https://github.com/hanshillen/jquery-ui/commits/tabs-hh-keyboard
[09:56:43] <jzaefferer> looks like this is what we're looking for: https://github.com/hanshillen/jquery-ui/commit/8612c6c564d27d30be7584155b1e28ad4e89687c
[09:56:44] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by hanshillen (4m, 3w ago): Added keyboard support for tabs
[09:57:33] <jzaefferer> as for datepicker, I landed Hans update today
[09:57:41] <jzaefferer> http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/datepicker-rewrite/index.html
[09:57:59] <jzaefferer> the top inline picker and the Date of Birth field are actually working, the rest not so mcuh
[09:58:22] <jzaefferer> Michelle might start working on datepicker in the next weeks
[09:58:31] <jzaefferer> I'm gonna update the date.js thingie
[10:00:20] <gnarf> sounds good jzaefferer
[10:00:55] <gnarf> im curious why we have that in its own directory instead of on the actual ui.datepicker, but whatever
[10:01:39] <jzaefferer> mostly so that any bug fixes that actually land in the current datepicker don't need to be merged
[10:01:50] <jzaefferer> or rather, can be merged cleanly
[10:02:23] <gnarf> hey borismoore - real quick before the meeting, paul_irish was asking me about jsviews / code stuffs a week or two ago, u might wanna ping him and chat :)
[10:02:37] <jzaefferer> we'll drop that once the datepicker actually gets closer to matching the spec
[10:02:52] <jzaefferer> that spec that we lost along with some etherpads...
[10:03:02] <borismoore> @gnarf k, thanks, will do
[10:03:30] <jzaefferer> hey borismoore brado23
[10:03:34] <borismoore> hey
[10:03:35] <jzaefferer> looks like richard won't be around
[10:03:41] <brado23> hey
[10:04:02] <borismoore> so we are 4 people?
[10:04:08] <jzaefferer> yeah
[10:04:18] <jzaefferer> wanna start with jsrender status?
[10:04:21] <borismoore> irc/skype?
[10:04:50] <borismoore> for jsrender, I've been on vacation :)
[10:05:04] <borismoore> But I did some minor fixes
[10:05:17] <borismoore> Lot of encouraging feedback since the conference
[10:05:43] <borismoore> Nothing new to report beyond what I showed then
[10:05:45] <jzaefferer> cool
[10:05:56] <brado23> re: dataview/observable, jzaefferer, I have some deltas/feedback that I developed in the course of integrating dataview/observable into Upshot.  I'd like to share at some point.
[10:06:11] <brado23> ...minor stuff.
[10:06:18] <jzaefferer> we have no progress on figuring out how to adapt it in UI, so maybe we should just start replacing jquery.tmpl with jsrender in the grid branch, maybe also datepicker
[10:06:22] <brado23> I'll send this over email.
[10:06:33] <borismoore> I need to work towards beta soon for jsrender.
[10:06:34] <jzaefferer> brado23: cool, or put it on the wiki
[10:06:48] <brado23> sure.  sounds good
[10:06:48] <borismoore> Need to decide whether to move jQuery UI now, or a bit later...
[10:07:28] <jzaefferer> I'll start replacing jquery.tmpl with jsrender, that should help
[10:07:29] <borismoore> I could start by a couple of fixes first, if you want, then give you the go ahead for a fairly stable version, but not beta
[10:07:50] <jzaefferer> we're not doing anything fancy anyway
[10:08:03] <jzaefferer> and apparently its faster then jquery.tmpl, so nothing to worry about really
[10:08:08] <borismoore> sure, that's true, should be fine then
[10:08:26] <jzaefferer> might also start deploying it on another project, also moving on from jquery.tmpl
[10:08:32] <borismoore> ok
[10:08:54] <jzaefferer> that actually involves a lot more templates, but we already have no js code within templates, and could make use of a propery API for custom tags
[10:11:14] <jzaefferer> as for other updates: landed a few improvements to grid itself to better deal with the source option, e.g. when source is null, the localDataview it creates and fills based on existing rows should now work properly with various grids
[10:11:59] <jzaefferer> took a few iterations, but the guy involved is interested in helping more
[10:12:53] <brado23> Ahh, interesting.  Who's "the guy involved"?
[10:13:33] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/adamboduch
[10:13:46] <jzaefferer> sent me a message of github
[10:13:56] <jzaefferer> hoping for more contributions
[10:14:20] <brado23> Does "LDV over existing rows" work by scraping data out of the TRs and creating an array of objects?
[10:14:51] <jzaefferer> brado23: yeah, pretty much
[10:14:59] <jzaefferer> the tablesorter demo makes use of that
[10:15:16] <brado23> If you have a github URL to share, I'd like to take a peek.
[10:15:22] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/grid/ui/jquery.ui.grid.js#L291
[10:15:36] <jzaefferer> http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-spf/tablesorter.html
[10:15:40] <brado23> thx
[10:18:05] <brado23> touch on bracketing next?
[10:18:12] <jzaefferer> yeah
[10:18:28] <brado23> you guys saw my email from last night...
[10:18:32] <gnarf> yup
[10:18:43] <brado23> I played around with using this "debouncing" technique in the TODO app.
[10:18:45] <jzaefferer> yeah, not enough time to dig in
[10:18:52] <jzaefferer> but at a glance looks good
[10:19:03] <jzaefferer> need to dig out a debounce implementation I recently wrote
[10:19:08] <jzaefferer> might be useful
[10:19:19] <brado23> We can break out and walk-through in Skype if there's interest.
[10:19:27] <jzaefferer> actually:
[10:19:27] <jzaefferer> Function.prototype.debounce = function(threshold) {
[10:19:27] <jzaefferer>   threshold = threshold || 100;
[10:19:28] <jzaefferer>   var func = this;
[10:19:28] <jzaefferer>   var timeout;
[10:19:28] <jzaefferer>   return function() {
[10:19:28] <jzaefferer>     var obj = this,
[10:19:28] <jzaefferer>         args = arguments;
[10:19:29] <jzaefferer>     clearTimeout(timeout);
[10:19:29] <jzaefferer>     timeout = setTimeout(function() {
[10:19:30] <jzaefferer>       func.apply(obj, args);
[10:19:30] <jzaefferer>     }, threshold);
[10:19:31] <jzaefferer>   };
[10:19:31] <jzaefferer> };
[10:19:39] * gnarf kicks jzaefferer for not gisting that
[10:19:46] <jzaefferer> >(
[10:19:57] <jzaefferer> https://gist.github.com/1298986
[10:20:04] <jzaefferer> we don't even need the threshold
[10:20:35] <jzaefferer> anyway, I could do a Skype call now
[10:20:37] <jzaefferer> on that
[10:20:55] <jzaefferer> apart from that, there's plenty of progress on custom inputs (mask, timepicker, selectmenu, datepicker)
[10:21:00] <brado23> Sure...maybe we wrap up the agenda and then resume on Skype.
[10:21:54] <brado23> (actually, I have a mtg in 9 minutes...so it'd have to be a short-ish Skype)
[10:22:39] <jzaefferer> you aren't even online on Skype
[10:22:48] <jzaefferer> or at least Skype tells me that
[10:23:02] <brado23> signing in...
[10:23:15] <brado23> Skype pushed a new client and lost my "login at startup" settings.
[10:23:25] <jzaefferer> ossom
[10:23:25] <brado23> there we go
[10:23:29] <jzaefferer> borismoore: wanna join?
[10:23:35] <borismoore> yep
