[11:03:59] <jasperdegroot> hi jperrault
[11:04:21] <gseguin> what's up? yo!
[11:04:23] <cgack> hey
[11:05:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:05:23] <jasperdegroot> do we have anything to discuss?
[11:05:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't have much. I've been diving into wordpress themes.
[11:06:00] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: I noticed we have one 1.4.3 ticket left https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7318
[11:06:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Made a couple of PRs for 1.4.4 tickets.
[11:06:21] <jasperdegroot> great
[11:06:29] <jasperdegroot> I am looking at some tickets now
[11:06:50] <gseguin> hmm, ok I can tag that repo with a semver
[11:07:59] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: ok thanks
[11:08:07] <gseguin> oh it's already tag
[11:08:20] <gseguin> oh, it's already tagged
[11:08:23] <gseguin> 1.3.2
[11:08:32] <gseguin> let me update the bower.json file in our repo
[11:08:50] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: see also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7554
[11:11:16] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: queued, I'll try looking into it today
[11:11:24] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: awesome, thanks
[11:12:24] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: wait, that's because what we distribute on bower is not the built version of jQM
[11:12:27] <gseguin> it's not a bug
[11:14:40] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: ok, maybe we need some info about Bower in the readme?
[11:15:08] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: that sounds like a good idea. I thought it already was documented.
[11:16:05] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: I don't see anything
[11:18:30] <jasperdegroot> anyways, I think we can move back to -dev
[11:18:30] <gseguin> I commented and closed the issue
[11:18:35] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: ok, thanks
[11:19:08] <gseguin> alright see you on -dev
[11:19:34] <jasperdegroot> later
