[09:02:46] <DaveMethvin> i am on a call
[09:03:57] <gibson0421> I have completely lost the past week, and it seems to be the _worst_ week to say that about
[09:05:24] <m_gol> gibson0421: what do you mean?
[09:06:50] <gibson0421> I spent zero time on jQuery, and judging by email subjects it would have been very beneficial to have done so
[09:07:21] <DaveMethvin> we love you gibson0421, come back!
[09:07:57] <gibson0421> I sure want to :)
[09:08:06] <DaveMethvin> if you could get the deferred pr done that would be awesome, i think that's the main item in your inbox
[09:08:46] <m_gol> there are a couple of Sizzle-related topics
[09:09:39] <m_gol> gibson0421: any take on https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/290?
[09:09:44] <timmywil> here
[09:09:51] <m_gol> hi :)
[09:10:27] <timmywil> anyone taking minutes?
[09:10:37] <DaveMethvin> i am not ... will have to bail in a second
[09:10:54] <timmywil> k
[09:11:38] <m_gol> I'm doing it
[09:11:57] <timmywil> cool
[09:12:15] <m_gol> so, https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/290
[09:12:34] <m_gol> Apple is apparently not interested in fixing it in iOS8
[09:12:35] <gibson0421> m_gol: I think we're driven to a new buggyQSA test
[09:12:45] <timmywil> yea, sounds like it
[09:13:04] <m_gol> I would've never suspected such a simple selector to not work
[09:13:11] <m_gol> in a new browser
[09:13:12] <timmywil> gibson0421: you or me?
[09:14:06] <gibson0421> do you know what _exactly_ broke?
[09:14:19] <gibson0421> the webkit ticket wasn't exactly clear to me at first glance
[09:14:21] <timmywil> I'd have to investigate the cases. Do you?
[09:14:36] <m_gol> "#id + p" works, "p#id + p" breaks
[09:15:01] <timmywil> sure, but we need to all cases
[09:15:07] <m_gol> yeah, sure
[09:15:28] <gibson0421> i.e., what about `tag#id ~ …` or `tag#id …`?
[09:15:55] <m_gol> fwiw, Safari 8 breaks in the same way, probably easier to test on desktop
[09:16:45] <gibson0421> or `[attr]#id`, or ...
[09:16:46] <m_gol> gibson0421: tag#id ~ breaks as well
[09:17:06] <timmywil> if it breaks in enough cases, we'd probably just set support.qsa to false
[09:17:13] <timmywil> which sucks
[09:17:29] <m_gol> '[style]#a ~ div' breaks
[09:17:53] <timmywil> tag[attr] div?
[09:18:05] <timmywil> maybe tied to compound with ID?
[09:18:10] <m_gol> it seems anything#id ~ anything breaks
[09:18:18] <timmywil> anyway, we could figure this out later
[09:18:30] <m_gol> ok, not anything
[09:18:32] <m_gol> right
[09:20:55] <timmywil> what else we got?
[09:21:22] <DaveMethvin> got to go .. timmywil can you close the channel?
[09:21:27] <timmywil> sure
[09:21:35] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys
[09:21:42] <timmywil> gibson0421: how's your .done proposal?
[09:21:45] <m_gol> browser suppoort ;)
[09:23:04] <gibson0421> actually, I have a half-finished response to jaubourg's PR that raises questions for which this would be the proper venue
[09:23:29] <gibson0421> re: compatibility with older jQueries and Promises/A+ and ECMAScript
[09:24:00] <gibson0421> we need to decide exactly what we're changing, and it will probably come with deprecations
[09:24:19] <gibson0421> but since it's only half-finished, I don't think much can happen on it yet
[09:24:42] <timmywil> ok
[09:26:17] <timmywil> So, now that we're on github issues, I have this dream that we get to a really small number of issues. There's probably still some triage we can do and there are some small ones to go through and knock out. Have a look at the list to see if you can grab any.
[09:27:36] <timmywil> Also, I think adding Shadow DOM support to Sizzle should be pretty trivial, but it might be a lot more complicated in core. We have an issue focused on .offset(), but I'm sure there are other areas we could look at.
[09:28:16] <timmywil> Feel free to open another issue if you think of an area that needs changes to work with Shadow roots.
[09:28:17] <gibson0421> timmywil: did you check if it already works?
[09:28:30] <timmywil> yea, it's another nodeType I believe
[09:28:39] <gibson0421> I thought they were DocumentFragment nodes
[09:28:50] <timmywil> ah, right, but the supported methods differ
[09:29:23] <timmywil> like it supports qsa, but not gByID or something
[09:29:26] <gibson0421> in that Shadow DOM supports more element methods, or fewer?
[09:30:00] <gibson0421> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/911362e4570591d84e4358971414e724ef3bfa52 might have been all we need
[09:30:07] <timmywil> It's been a while. Someone opened an issue a while ago.
[09:30:32] <timmywil> Maybe, I just ported an issue from bugs.jquery.com
[09:30:36] <gibson0421> ok
[09:31:17] <timmywil> would be great if we don't need more changes
[09:31:24] <timmywil> but we could use a shadow root test
[09:31:32] <gibson0421> took the words right out of my fingers
[09:32:04] <timmywil> anyone have another issue to bring up?
[09:32:07] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1837
[09:32:21] <m_gol> any additional feedback? do you want to look at it more before landing?
[09:33:12] <timmywil> looks good to me as long as tests pass
[09:33:34] <m_gol> I still don't understand why this line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1837/files#diff-6d4bb79610683d9749d2cbb62e708d88R19 is necessary for tests to not break...
[09:33:37] <m_gol> need to investigate more
[09:34:05] <m_gol> apart from that I can land it unless someone wants to have another look
[09:34:19] <m_gol> tests pass at least on IE8, Fx, Chrome & Android 2.3
[09:34:36] <timmywil> oh, is it that doc ready line?
[09:34:48] <m_gol> yes
[09:35:07] <timmywil> is it the last one in compat internally?
[09:35:58] <m_gol> no :)
[09:36:10] <timmywil> heh, then I have no guesses
[09:36:12] <m_gol> ah, a moment, wrong branch
[09:36:14] <m_gol> lemme check
[09:36:15] <m_gol> again
[09:36:31] <m_gol> yes, that's the last one
[09:36:50] <timmywil> so, we might need at least one to ensure doc ready gets run
[09:36:52] <m_gol> (at least the last one matching /jQuery\(\s*function/
[09:37:02] <timmywil> might be different in master
[09:37:05] <m_gol> yeah, but it's not needed for master
[09:37:53] <timmywil> yea, look at bottom of ready.js in master
[09:38:02] <timmywil> might need the same in compat
[09:38:06] <m_gol> ah, right
[09:38:23] <m_gol> thank you :)
[09:38:32] <timmywil> np ;)
[09:38:56] <timmywil> aight, if that's all, I'll close the channel
[09:38:58] <m_gol> that reminds me
[09:39:06] <m_gol> that I can remove the doScroll(left) hack
[09:39:09] <m_gol> as well
[09:39:15] <timmywil> oh yea! good call
[09:39:24] <m_gol> I wonder how many of those I've missed...
[09:39:37] <timmywil> we can always do more incrementally too
[09:39:40] <m_gol> sure
[09:39:49] <timmywil> thanks all!
[09:39:52] <m_gol> thx
