[08:58:47] <jzaefferer> test
[09:00:32] <gnarf> pass
[09:02:32] <jzaefferer> weee
[09:02:49] <gnarf> So - view repo is public now right?
[09:03:03] <jzaefferer> I started editing the agenda, but then got nowhere past making a copy of last weeks and renaming it
[09:03:16] <gnarf> edit as we go! :)
[09:03:19] <jzaefferer> but yeah, danheberden finally hit the switch
[09:03:33] <gnarf> any docs updates?
[09:03:42] <jzaefferer> rworth: yt?
[09:03:45] <jzaefferer> but prolly not
[09:03:56] <gnarf> whos all around btw?
[09:04:03] <scott_gonzalez> I am
[09:04:06] <kborchers> here
[09:04:46] <gnarf> pending a sneak attack on docs updates -- Testing the animations in widgets - I reviewed this again, have a plan, just need to write the code
[09:05:12] <danheberden> i'm very round
[09:06:03] <rworth> hey
[09:07:12] <gnarf> cool
[09:07:38] <jzaefferer> kborchers: what's the status of #7686?
[09:07:40] <jzaefferer> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7686
[09:07:51] <kborchers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/454
[09:07:52] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (1d, 22h ago): Datepicker: Added additional check to checkExternalClick
[09:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah, I think that's on me
[09:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers sent a pull request that had a failing test, then he fixed it and I never got back to reviewing it
[09:08:31] <gnarf> is there a way to get a unit on that?
[09:09:03] <gnarf> so we don't regress it again?
[09:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> we can
[09:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> though I'm very much inclined to just reject all datepicker PRs at this point
[09:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> even for bug fixes
[09:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> I think >50% of bug fixes in datepicker cause regressions
[09:09:57] <jzaefferer> yeah, its pretty bad
[09:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> so I'm fine with landing this fix and knowing that it won't regress because we won't touch it :-P
[09:10:24] <jzaefferer> datepicker has a big test suite, it doesn't help
[09:10:41] <gnarf> we should still test it against the "new datepicker" too right?
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, but we're not going to go through all the old unit tests when we write the new ones
[09:11:19] <gnarf> fair nuff
[09:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> unlike the existing plugins with shitty test suites, where I actually do look at every previous test during the redesigns
[09:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> there's going to be too many massive API changes in datepicker
[09:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> anyway, on to the next topic
[09:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'll review that PR today
[09:14:35] <gnarf> hrm
[09:14:36] <jzaefferer> pr442 is going to land very soon
[09:14:44] <jzaefferer> gonna give that another round of testing
[09:14:50] <kborchers> for position, i just tested the changes he made to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/419/ It fixed the broken test in FF but broke the 5280 bug test in IE9. left a comment in the PR
[09:14:51] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by inukshuk (1m, 1w ago): Positions: added conditional suppression of position rounding
[09:14:54] <gnarf> I'm still on PR 419
[09:15:13] <gnarf> Out of curiosity, could we use the "create a body" trick?
[09:15:21] <gnarf> instead of "dom ready" ?
[09:15:45] <gnarf> advantages?
[09:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it should use the fake body
[09:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure we discussed that lsat week
[09:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> must not have made a note of it
[09:16:28] <kborchers> yeah, i was going to do it then he replied so we thought we would let him try
[09:16:30] <gnarf> I'll add a note to the PR
[09:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> and I added a note to the agenda
[09:18:37] <jzaefferer> well, dunno if there's anything else to discuss, the agenda isn't providing much
[09:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> we found someone to work on download builder
[09:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> we have a call with the nodejitsu team on Friday to go over the implementation details
[09:20:04] <gnarf> fun
[09:20:07] <gnarf> what time?
[09:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> we've already given them the specs (available at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41505725/Download%20Builder%20Rewrite )
[09:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> 1p ET
[09:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> so we should finally start seeing some progress there
[09:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: do you want to be on the call in case they have any questions about infrastructure?
[09:21:39] <danheberden> yeah, i'd like to be a part of that
[09:21:45] <danheberden> if only to listen in
[09:22:40] <gnarf> same
[09:22:43] <danheberden> scared the shit out of me scott_gonzalez
[09:22:47] <danheberden> haha, my phone went off wehn you made that
[09:22:56] <scott_gonzalez> hah
[09:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> last thing on the agenda: 1.9m6 is going live today
[09:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> with the updated spinner API
[09:24:15] <gnarf> YAY!
[09:24:20] <gnarf> and new events API
[09:24:23] <gnarf> er effects
[09:24:36] <gnarf> i don't think any of that was in m5
[09:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> oh, really?
[09:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> I guess m5 was quite a while ago
[09:25:27] * gnarf grins
[09:25:45] <gnarf> are you gonna write up a blog post about stuff to look at in m6?
[09:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:26:52] <gnarf> coo
[09:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> we don't have effects on the wiki, do we?
[09:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> nope, page is pretty empty: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137882/Effects
[09:28:20] <jzaefferer> menu and position also got a lot of updates since m5
[09:28:22] <gnarf> I don't think so
[09:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> anyone have anything else?
[09:31:01] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:31:09] <rworth> lata
[09:31:19] <jzaefferer> time to watch some funny cat videos
[09:59:37] <gnarf> ROUND 2 - FIGHT!

[10:06:58] <rworth> borismoore: any update on template?
[10:07:06] <borismoore> working on it, and making progress
[10:07:20] <borismoore> but not yet ready for external consumption :)
[10:07:38] <borismoore> encouraging, but it's quite a bit of work
[10:07:55] <rworth> any eta? Last week we talked about a goal to have something together in time for the conference
[10:08:01] <borismoore> Try and push by EOW at least something you can play with
[10:08:12] <rworth> that would be great, thanks
[10:08:14] <borismoore> sure
[10:08:53] <rworth> we'll talk about observable end editing/data-linking on a skype call in I guess 1hr or so?
[10:08:58] <rworth> anything else until then?
[10:09:11] <borismoore> not from me
[10:09:22] <brado23> nope.
[10:09:31] <rworth> ok, talk to you then. thanks
[10:09:40] <brado23> sounds good.
