[11:07:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot: Meeting time :)
[11:07:41] <jasperdegroot> hey
[11:07:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey!
[11:08:41] <arschmitz> so this is it today i think for people
[11:09:01] <jasperdegroot> yeah, think so
[11:09:57] <arschmitz> why dont we make this real quick then
[11:11:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Works for me.
[11:11:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: jasperdegroot: care to fill in on anything from last 2 weeks?
[11:11:38] <arschmitz> and then we can just discuss 1.4.4 and 1.5 briefly
[11:12:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Basically I put in a few more PRs for bugs that showed up after 1.4.3.
[11:12:30] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and I moved up some of my PRs which developed merge conflicts.
[11:12:42] <arschmitz> ok
[11:13:07] <jasperdegroot> I have nothing much
[11:13:14] <arschmitz> ok
[11:13:15] <jasperdegroot> will try to do some triage soon
[11:13:19] <arschmitz> so 1.4.4
[11:13:31] <arschmitz> anything major come up for that yet?
[11:13:57] <jasperdegroot> not major as far as I know
[11:14:31] <arschmitz> cool gabriel_schulhof i know you found 2 regressions right?
[11:15:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[11:15:37] <arschmitz> how do other pending 1.4.4 issues look at this point?
[11:15:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Grabbing the link, hold on ...
[11:15:52] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Regression&state=open
[11:16:25] <gabriel_schulhof> The selectmenu one irritates me especially, since I made the modification that introduced it.
[11:17:18] <gabriel_schulhof> I realized that you only need to worry about accidentally injecting scripts if you use something like $( "<div>" + text + "</div>" ) where the text ultimately comes from outside the library.
[11:17:39] <arschmitz> yup
[11:17:45] <gabriel_schulhof> If you ever need to display an untrusted string, you must use $( "<div>" ).text( untrustedString )
[11:17:56] <arschmitz> correct
[11:17:58] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because .text() automagically entity-encodes.
[11:18:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I now grok this.
[11:18:22] <arschmitz> yeah well i did already and still missed it in review
[11:18:27] <arschmitz> cant catch everything
[11:18:37] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:18:48] <jasperdegroot> I closed this one as not a bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7551
[11:18:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't blame you. It's pretty complex juggling in _buildList()
[11:19:23] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah now we get bugs on bugs lol
[11:19:41] <jasperdegroot> yeah, it's more about what behaviour you expect
[11:19:51] <jasperdegroot> I guess we are not clear enough about it in the docs
[11:19:57] <arschmitz> yeahi think ever defaulting to mini is a bad idea
[11:20:07] <arschmitz> i think that should be left to the dev
[11:20:12] <jasperdegroot> but I suggest to get rid of the inline and mini by default for toolbars
[11:20:18] <jasperdegroot> agreed
[11:20:31] <jasperdegroot> not sure if I already opened a ticket for that yet
[11:20:39] <arschmitz> yeah non inline in a toolbar makes almost no sense but for consistency i agree
[11:20:44] <jasperdegroot> if not I'll open a new one
[11:21:06] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:21:17] <arschmitz> i think these are places we tried to think for the devs too much rather then let them make their own decisions
[11:21:26] <jasperdegroot> it also affects buttons in grids though
[11:21:38] <jasperdegroot> non-inline in grids inside toolbars does make sense
[11:21:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup
[11:21:46] <jasperdegroot> so let's just remove it
[11:22:10] <arschmitz> yup we can deprecate it in 1.5
[11:22:25] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:22:38] <arschmitz> and probably just leave until new button widget
[11:23:26] <arschmitz> since that has no concept of inline or not but it also can be done with a simple class width:100%
[11:23:59] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:24:01] <arschmitz> but really thats all theme anyway
[11:24:06] <arschmitz> has nothing to do with the widget
[11:26:02] <arschmitz> ok so 1.5
[11:26:15] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i know you were working on table
[11:26:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[11:26:25] <gabriel_schulhof> I kinda got burned out on it
[11:26:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: is that still what your working on for 1.5?
[11:26:34] <gabriel_schulhof> So I'm giving it a break.
[11:26:42] <gabriel_schulhof> It's pretty much done.
[11:26:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[11:26:52] <gabriel_schulhof> The only thing I need to add is unit tests for the extensions.
[11:27:21] <arschmitz> what about throttling the row generation?
[11:27:28] <gabriel_schulhof> I think only columntoggle unit tests is missing.
[11:27:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right, and that.
[11:27:45] <gabriel_schulhof> That might be an extension though.
[11:27:55] <arschmitz> thats important :)
[11:28:05] <arschmitz> but cant come back to it
[11:28:32] <gabriel_schulhof> I wanna first restore the status quo in terms of what we've had in the table widget with a thorough review.
[11:28:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats fine
[11:28:53] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and the extension system is causing some complex code flow.
[11:29:07] <arschmitz> now that we are full on 1.5 ill do a first pass review and testing
[11:29:48] <gabriel_schulhof> For example, in reflow we do refresh, which iterates over the headers in one order, but reflow has to iterate over them in the opposite order, so, in addition to the basic table refresh, it has to do a second loop in the opposite direction.
[11:30:22] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I cannot fully reuse the base class refresh() helpers.
[11:30:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah its pretty complex i had a hard time grasping the logic at first
[11:30:49] <arschmitz> when working on it
[11:31:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... actually, if the reflow table loops in the opposite direction, the direction could be factored out in the base class and overridden in the subclass ...
[11:31:31] * gabriel_schulhof scratches his beard
[11:31:47] <arschmitz> beard eh?
[11:31:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[11:32:09] <arschmitz> have not seen you with a beard before
[11:32:12] <gabriel_schulhof> The good news is that I'm testing things to death, so if I break something with a code change, I'll know it.
[11:32:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No, I always shave before going to the States.
[11:32:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Gotta look good at the border.
[11:32:37] <arschmitz> lol julian has had issues
[11:32:42] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:32:44] <arschmitz> but not at the us border
[11:32:51] <arschmitz> at the belgium one
[11:33:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, flying into Belgion, eh?
[11:33:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Gah! Belgium.
[11:33:21] <arschmitz> no leaving
[11:33:22] <gabriel_schulhof> What's wrong with me?
[11:33:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Towards the States?
[11:33:35] <arschmitz> yes
[11:33:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, well, that's basically the US border then, because they do a pre-screening before you even board.
[11:33:59] <arschmitz> yea
[11:34:11] <gabriel_schulhof> It's funny.
[11:34:28] <gabriel_schulhof> In the communist system, there was a border at the exit as well as at the entrance.
[11:34:36] <arschmitz> ok anyway lol jasperdegroot: is there anything for 1.5 you are working on?
[11:34:40] <gabriel_schulhof> You needed an exit via from your own country.
[11:34:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway ...
[11:35:02] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: no, nothing yet
[11:35:09] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok
[11:35:12] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: will take care of this for 1.5 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7377
[11:35:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok
[11:36:01] <jasperdegroot> will also check with cgack when he is back if he need help with things for navbar
[11:36:17] <jasperdegroot> with the CSS or new demos
[11:36:22] <arschmitz> i think hes waiting for me to review at the moment
[11:36:39] <jasperdegroot> yeah, think so too
[11:37:09] <arschmitz> which brings something up
[11:37:34] <arschmitz> because of all the issues in 1.4.x we have had 1.5 has been pushed back quite a bit i think
[11:38:42] <arschmitz> so we need to decide to do an abridged 1.5 to get it out sooner or adjust our timetable for 1.5 to account for the fact of getting pushed back
[11:39:30] <arschmitz> some things to consider is 1.4 was a really big release and the patches have been big too
[11:39:31] <jasperdegroot> yeah, i agree we should look at the planning again
[11:39:42] <jasperdegroot> but we don't have that much ready yet, do we?
[11:39:51] <arschmitz> right
[11:40:03] <arschmitz> so i think we should push back rather then abridge the release
[11:40:12] <arschmitz> i think the community could use a break lol
[11:40:16] <jasperdegroot> yeah, think so too
[11:40:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what do you think?
[11:41:16] <jasperdegroot> maybe we should only do 1.5 and 1.6 before 2.0, drop 1.7
[11:41:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: some of that will also depend on ui
[11:41:45] <arschmitz> so we need to kinda take that as it goes
[11:41:57] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: right
[11:42:28] <arschmitz> but its very possible we will just have to see how quickly things come together
[11:42:33] <arschmitz> espically with theme
[11:42:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I think we can cut it off at some feature boundary.
[11:42:58] <gabriel_schulhof> ... if we start to feel that too much time has passed.
[11:43:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[11:43:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i think the question is really about how soon we thing there should be a release from now
[11:44:01] <arschmitz> i think jasperdegroot and i were expressing we thing the community needs time to digest the 1.4.x releases
[11:44:22] <jasperdegroot> i think first 1.5 pre release in september will be fine
[11:44:23] <arschmitz> so we should push back our release schedule to say in essence 1.5 starts now
[11:45:15] <jasperdegroot> or maybe even october if september is too soon
[11:45:28] <jasperdegroot> realize it's already second half of July
[11:45:39] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup
[11:46:22] <arschmitz> and sadly summer is generally a very slow development time because of vacations
[11:46:30] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:46:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[11:47:56] <arschmitz> i think october should be our goal
[11:48:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Sounds good.
[11:48:53] <jasperdegroot> +1
[11:49:38] <arschmitz> ok so lets put some thought into what at this point is going to make sense on 1.5
[11:49:49] <arschmitz> and we can discuss more next week when hopefully we have more people
[11:50:00] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:50:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, table should be ready to go :)
[11:50:16] <arschmitz> yeah table and navbar for sure lol
[11:50:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, that too :)
[11:50:44] <gabriel_schulhof> We should also look at nav.
[11:51:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: iv already been doing that that will be in every release from now on lol
[11:51:35] <jasperdegroot> might be good to have a ticket for that like we have for navbar and table
[11:51:41] <jasperdegroot> with bullets
[11:52:00] <jasperdegroot> multiple tickets prabably, one for each milestone
[11:52:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We need to hack out all the dialogHashKey special cases.
[11:52:05] <jasperdegroot> probably*
[11:52:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: there will be but some things need to be seperated before we can have defined things to discuss
[11:52:38] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:52:50] <gabriel_schulhof> I'd personally love to see init cleaned up.
[11:52:53] <arschmitz> and we dont want it to devolve before we have concrete things to discuss we dont want another pagecontainer events ticket
[11:53:21] <gabriel_schulhof> init is an entangled mess.
[11:53:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes thats essentially the first part of nav
[11:53:44] <arschmitz> ( currently )
[11:53:50] <arschmitz> though i think we will change that
[11:54:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Things kinda work without init, but only widgets.
[11:54:20] <gabriel_schulhof> IINM, pagecontainer doesn't work without init.
[11:54:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont believe so
[11:54:34] <arschmitz> but i have not tried
[11:54:51] <gabriel_schulhof> At least, I haven't been able to $.testHelper.asyncLoad([ [ "widgets/pagecontainer" ] ]);
[11:55:01] <gabriel_schulhof> for pagecontainer unit tests.
[11:55:15] <gabriel_schulhof> There's actually a circular dependency.
[11:55:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah pretty sure pagecontainer is in no way standalone
[11:55:49] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7158
[11:56:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah this is something more for dev but yes nav should not depend on pagecontainer in anyway
[11:56:46] <arschmitz> and i dont even think it actually does
[11:57:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I think it's only because of $.mobile.changePage()
[11:57:40] <arschmitz> ok
[11:57:41] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and $.mobile.pageContainer;
[11:57:59] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: anyting else you wanted to discuss? I have another call in a minute
[11:58:01] <arschmitz> so thats fixed in 1.5 anyway then
[11:58:09] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no i think we are done here
[11:58:13] <gabriel_schulhof> I think if we manage to make pagecontainer standalone, we'll be able to ditch init altogether and re-write it.
[11:58:14] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:58:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[11:58:55] <arschmitz> ok so lets wrap this up
[11:58:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, let's go back to -dev
[11:59:03] <gabriel_schulhof> L8R all.
[11:59:04] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[11:59:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Good question.
[11:59:46] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back on -dev
