[08:58:42] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:00:16] <timmywil> ahhhh
[09:02:08] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, meant to add the chinese wiki pages to the docs, i bet karl can do that
[09:02:14] <DaveMethvin> he knows chinese
[09:02:15] <DaveMethvin> i bet
[09:02:30] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:02:51] <DaveMethvin> hi guys ...  looks like timmywil and gibson042 so far?
[09:02:59] <gibson042> yep
[09:03:15] <timmywil> oo big agenda
[09:03:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah just lots of words
[09:03:42] <DaveMethvin> but i wanted to see if all of that makes sense, schedule wise
[09:04:03] <timmywil> so I think 1.8.2 is bug-free. right??
[09:04:08] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:04:16] <DaveMethvin> nothing major afaict
[09:04:24] <DaveMethvin> you guys stomped out the sizzle bugs
[09:04:35] <timmywil> I blame gibson042
[09:04:44] <DaveMethvin> except for that heat load on the crawford house
[09:04:46] <DaveMethvin> fix that!
[09:04:50] <timmywil> beleted
[09:05:04] <rwaldron> Hi!
[09:05:04] <gibson042> that's a jQuery bug, I vote to refile it
[09:05:19] <DaveMethvin> we gotta fix the heat load problem
[09:05:25] <DaveMethvin> it's a blocker
[09:05:30] <timmywil> the wiki has revision history, so if we get goobers editing the docs, we can always revert
[09:05:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:05:53] <DaveMethvin> i doubt we need a lot of public edits on it
[09:05:56] <timmywil> not that it really needs to change much
[09:06:01] <timmywil> yerp
[09:06:02] <DaveMethvin> probably better to control what goes in
[09:06:15] <timmywil> ANYWAY
[09:06:22] <DaveMethvin> ya
[09:06:52] <DaveMethvin> so i'd like to land all the pre-1.9 bug fixes and patches before the summit
[09:07:03] <DaveMethvin> get a nice base for 1.9 that way
[09:07:26] <DaveMethvin> if we think someone would want to finish them during the summit we could do that i guess
[09:07:42] <DaveMethvin> but soon thereafter i want to get 1.9 underway
[09:07:46] <DaveMethvin> chop chop chop
[09:07:50] <rwaldron> Excellent
[09:07:55] <timmywil> yay!
[09:08:10] <DaveMethvin> gentlemen, get your delete keys going
[09:08:12] <timmywil> I think it can just be 1.9pre, pending any blockers in 1.8.2
[09:08:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's hard to imagine a critical fix at this point
[09:08:50] <DaveMethvin> and we have a couple of weeks
[09:09:01] <DaveMethvin> so on the compat plugin
[09:09:04] <DaveMethvin> i've started that
[09:09:12] <DaveMethvin> but i don't like the name
[09:09:15] <DaveMethvin> hi jaubourg
[09:09:16] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:09:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the name?
[09:09:25] <timmywil> jaubourg: bonjour!
[09:09:26] <DaveMethvin> of the compat plugin
[09:09:32] <jaubourg> I won't have much time (like 10 mins or something)
[09:09:38] <DaveMethvin> i was gonna call it jquery-compat-1.9
[09:09:41] <DaveMethvin> but that's not right
[09:09:47] <DaveMethvin> perhaps just jquery-compat
[09:09:55] <DaveMethvin> b/c i want it to serve multple purposes
[09:10:03] <jaubourg> jOld
[09:10:06] <DaveMethvin> 1) warn people when they're using removed features
[09:10:21] <DaveMethvin> 2) patch in those features for 1.9/2.0
[09:10:26] <rwaldron> jquery-deprecation-compatibility.js
[09:10:30] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:10:30] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:10:31] <timmywil> new project? jquery-compat.js
[09:10:31] <DaveMethvin> 3) there is no #3
[09:10:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:10:43] <jaubourg> jDonotusethese
[09:10:46] <DaveMethvin> i think compat by itself would be good
[09:10:47] <rwaldron> +1
[09:10:54] <DaveMethvin> i will rename the repo
[09:10:58] <rwaldron> ok
[09:11:04] <timmywil> that's fine
[09:11:10] <rwaldron> you can then roll in jQuery.browser
[09:11:30] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-browser
[09:11:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah rwaldron i think i want it all to go into a single repo
[09:11:59] <rwaldron> yes
[09:12:01] <rwaldron> I agree
[09:12:04] <timmywil> btw, I don't think we'll realistically maintain a "1.8-stable" branch. 1.8.2 seems to be in a great place so far, so maybe we can move on.
[09:12:07] <rwaldron> >1 is confusing
[09:12:34] <gibson042> so the plugin will make 1.9/2.0 act like 1.8... what's the plan going forward?
[09:12:38] <DaveMethvin> i sure hope we don't have to revisit 1.8.x but if we do we can always create a branch on demand
[09:12:48] <timmywil> true nuff
[09:13:03] <gibson042> i.e., always one major back?
[09:13:12] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: that's why i think the plugin was badly nameed, you should be able to use it with 2.0 too
[09:13:14] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I thought that 1.9x was the last of the 1.x
[09:13:19] <rwaldron> 1.8.2 would not be supported
[09:13:20] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: probably
[09:13:25] <rwaldron> same way we do it today
[09:13:40] <DaveMethvin> correct there
[09:13:50] <rwaldron> So, if someone reports a 1.8.2 bug, we say "be sure to check against 1.9"
[09:13:54] <DaveMethvin> i was just thinking we might need to put out a 1.8.3
[09:13:58] <rwaldron> and if they come back and say "something is missing"
[09:14:02] <DaveMethvin> but we can do that as needed on demand
[09:14:04] <rwaldron> we say "use the compat plugin"
[09:14:24] <timmywil> not important right now, but I was assuming 1.9 would continue into the 1.10s and 2.0 would go to 2.1, until we can finally say 1.9+ is no longer officially supported
[09:14:34] <DaveMethvin> yes timmywil
[09:14:39] <jaubourg> ok, I'm sorry but I gotta go :/
[09:14:40] <rwaldron> 1.8.3 would be the pre-1.9 release, correct?
[09:14:47] <rwaldron> if that needed to happen
[09:14:54] <DaveMethvin> right if needed
[09:14:54] <rwaldron> (I'm asking the wrong question)
[09:15:05] <rwaldron> We will only maintain 1.x and 2.x
[09:15:07] <DaveMethvin> also, i would like to give ppl the -compat plugin and have them use it with 1.8 as a diagnostic tool
[09:15:12] <jaubourg> anybody interested in giving feedback onto ajaxHooks, feel free to do so on the doc, thanks
[09:15:16] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: only two versions maintained
[09:15:19] <rwaldron> not 1.8.x, 1.x and 2.x
[09:15:22] <rwaldron> ok
[09:15:23] <DaveMethvin> 1.x and 2.x
[09:15:24] <rwaldron> lovely
[09:15:32] <DaveMethvin> thanks jaubourg
[09:15:41] <jaubourg> sorry I couldn't stay longer :/
[09:15:44] <jaubourg> bbye
[09:16:28] <DaveMethvin> so I *think* master should be 1.9, then after we get everything deleted and cleaned up we make master be 2.0
[09:16:36] <DaveMethvin> and do the finishing touches to 1.9 in a branch
[09:16:47] <timmywil> I think it might make more sense to make 2.0 the branch
[09:16:47] <DaveMethvin> the exact time that happens can be flexible
[09:17:08] <DaveMethvin> well usually master is the latest, and 2.0 is kind of the latest
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> either way we'll be doing some work in branches
[09:17:24] <timmywil> 2.0 is completely fresh while 1.9 continues to have IE fixes
[09:17:42] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:17:48] <DaveMethvin> you have a point timmywil
[09:18:15] <rwaldron> I will have the note summary soon, but I pushed for an "extend, merge, mixin, augment, whatever-the-hell" prior to and at last week's TC39
[09:18:23] <timmywil> that way it doesn't matter when we start 2.0, it can keep getting pushed to it's own branch
[09:18:23] <rwaldron> and I got it.
[09:18:25] <DaveMethvin> after the common deletes, 1.9 won't have alot of diffs but 2.0 will
[09:18:43] <DaveMethvin> okay i agree with timmywil now ... other thoughts?
[09:19:05] <rwaldron> timmywil +1
[09:19:18] <rwaldron> to making a 2.0 branch to start working in
[09:19:33] <rwaldron> but I made that argument and was told I was wrong by someone
[09:19:40] <rwaldron> so now it's your turn
[09:19:41] <DaveMethvin> well as soon as we whack stuff out in the 1.9
[09:19:44] <rwaldron> g'luck
[09:19:58] <gibson042> they should be swapping after 1.9, right?
[09:20:13] <gibson042> 2.0 is the branch until 1.9 becomes a branch and 2.x is master
[09:20:17] <timmywil> at some point we can swap when it feels right
[09:20:18] <DaveMethvin> well we are going to support both for quite a while
[09:20:18] <rwaldron> I suggested it as a "starting today" thing
[09:20:22] <rwaldron> that can merge later
[09:20:35] <DaveMethvin> but there's a lot of common stuff to do before we split
[09:20:39] <rwaldron> what whatever
[09:20:41] <DaveMethvin> common bug fixes and deletions
[09:20:54] <DaveMethvin> so the bug fixes should happen in the next 3 weeks
[09:20:59] <DaveMethvin> then the deletions
[09:21:20] <DaveMethvin> and feature adds, not a lot of those, but like gnarf's thing for the data api
[09:21:48] <timmywil> sure, bugs first
[09:21:54] <peol> Sorry, just came home. Have you discussed the SVG stuff yet?
[09:21:58] <DaveMethvin> but i am hoping we'll have most of 1.9 ready for a solid beta right after thanksgiving
[09:22:05] <DaveMethvin> peol: no
[09:22:38] <DaveMethvin> so i think we can start the voting on 1.9 stuff this week too
[09:22:51] <DaveMethvin> we need a report for that, lemme make a note
[09:23:10] <DaveMethvin> let me try my luck with making one now
[09:23:14] <DaveMethvin> cmon trac
[09:23:18] <rwaldron> peol yes
[09:23:30] <rwaldron> SVG support
[09:23:30] <rwaldron> Would like a deeper analysis before official support
[09:23:30] <rwaldron> Okay with landing simple SVG fixes
[09:24:16] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?keywords=~1.9-discuss&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
[09:24:46] <DaveMethvin> doing a quick look
[09:25:19] <DaveMethvin> not sure if all of these are really vote-worthy but meh
[09:25:38] <DaveMethvin> keep that in mind, some may be more "fix em if they're easy"
[09:25:51] <peol> rwaldron, cool. I just noticed a regression with delegation today concerning SVG (actually, the "improve delegate performance" checkin just before 1.8.2). I'm gonna look at it tonight but I just wanted to check if you'd accept PR's for SVG. Got my answer I guess :)
[09:26:28] <DaveMethvin> peol: i'd like to see a test case
[09:26:35] <peol> DaveMethvin, http://jsfiddle.net/qqvzM/3/
[09:26:39] <peol> ;)
[09:27:00] <timmywil> the boolHook is probably a longer conversation
[09:27:04] <DaveMethvin> i really hate SVG
[09:28:07] <DaveMethvin> jquery is a DOM library, not an SVG library
[09:28:16] <DaveMethvin> and unfortunately they've defined things differently
[09:28:25] <peol> Yeah, it's a bit of a PITA
[09:29:07] <DaveMethvin> okay well a ticket seems to be in order peol in any case and if you have a small simple fix we can consider
[09:30:23] <DaveMethvin> oh and nice bike timmywil!
[09:30:32] <timmywil> thanks! :)
[09:30:45] <peol> Anyway, the "simple" fix was to change  "needsContext ?" to "needsContext || isSVG ?" here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L397 But I'm not too sure about what other impacts such a change could have
[09:30:56] <timmywil> need a seat cover, but mechanically, seems great
[09:30:58] <peol> I'll create a bug report in a bit
[09:31:53] <timmywil> aights, I need to get lunch
[09:31:57] <DaveMethvin> so the list of assigned tix is too long to go thru in detail ... be sure to look at your assigned tix and see if they should be landed now
[09:32:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's pretty much it
[09:32:20] <peol> Maybe timmywil can shed some light into that, the jQuery.find( sel, this, null, [ cur ] ).length; part doesn't find any element if cur is an element inside an SVG root :)
[09:32:30] <peol> Sorry, I'll jump over to -dev instead
[09:32:46] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys!
[09:32:59] <timmywil> peol; we can discuss, but that just runs a filter over `this`, with `cur` as the context
