[14:03:41] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting!
[14:03:51] <sfrisk> kristjy, arschmitz, geekman-rohit, nashavail
[14:08:04] <sfrisk> hey kristyjy
[14:08:13] <kristyjy> hi sorry I"m late
[14:08:20] <sfrisk> you're the first one to show up!
[14:08:23] <kristyjy> LOL
[14:08:35] <sfrisk> I'll check out your tables PR tonight
[14:09:10] <kristyjy> sounds good. It probably needs some work after the addition of reset. I kinda forgot about that
[14:11:06] <sfrisk> okay
[14:11:26] <sfrisk> I know geekman-rohit mentioned he might not be able to make it today
[14:11:45] <sfrisk> Right then
[14:11:47] <sfrisk> if nothing else
[14:11:49] <sfrisk> meeting done
[14:12:11] <kristyjy> also not sure if it's my fault the CLA is failing. It does say I signed
[14:12:22] <sfrisk> did you sign the new one?
[14:12:25] <kristyjy> yeah
[14:12:26] <sfrisk> I can look into it
[14:12:42] <kristyjy> it says I signed when I click it again so in theory I'm good
[14:12:46] <kristyjy> just want to make sure :)
[14:14:49] <sfrisk> I know we've had some bugs with that
