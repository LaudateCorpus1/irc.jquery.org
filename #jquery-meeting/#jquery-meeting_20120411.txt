[09:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone.
[09:01:24] <jzaefferer> Hey kborchers, still around? danheberden? rworth?
[09:01:35] <kborchers> o/
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> I think danheberden is on a plane.
[09:03:39] <rworth> here
[09:03:50] <jzaefferer> rworth:
[09:03:54] <jzaefferer> while here, docs?
[09:04:11] <rworth> nothing, but I will be working on them the rest of this week
[09:04:11] <jzaefferer> more to the point, once Menu is done, Kris wants to move on to docs
[09:04:17] <rworth> awesome
[09:04:47] <rworth> I'll get him up and cracking tomorrow
[09:04:56] <rworth> kborchers when do you get in?
[09:05:03] <jzaefferer> So focus should be split between finishing the integrations, especially with Wordpress, and passing on to Kris
[09:05:04] <kborchers> rworth: just let me know where i should jump in ... not sure where you are
[09:05:18] <kborchers> rworth: around 10 or 11 tonight
[09:05:45] <jzaefferer> I'd say Kris knows enough about the content editing after working on menu docs, but the mediawiki import and wordpress export is too much magic
[09:05:54] <jzaefferer> I wouldn't be of much help there at least
[09:06:05] <rworth> sounds good
[09:06:14] <jzaefferer> kborchers: So you'll be done by tomorrow at 11?
[09:06:24] <kborchers> :P
[09:06:32] <jzaefferer> I see
[09:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> Moving on to grunt...
[09:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> All existing functionality has been ported to grunt and we're working on new functionality.
[09:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> Hoping to add HTML linting very soon. Mike Smith from W3C is just waiting on some review of the work he did for us.
[09:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> Review from W3C, not from us.
[09:08:46] <jzaefferer> Once I get a hold of rwaldron, we can even start extracting the sizer task
[09:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> I've updated the prepare-release script to work with grunt.
[09:09:28] <jzaefferer> Yeah, currently it looks like we can get a single 18meg jar file, put that into a a grunt-html plugin and publish to npm...
[09:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> So we're just waiting on a final verification from rworth that grunt is producing the correct output before releasing 1.8.19.
[09:11:23] <jzaefferer> That's pretty much all we have, it seems
[09:11:40] <rworth> I noticed the gruntfiles are different between master and 1-8-stable
[09:12:02] <jzaefferer> Yeah, because 1-8-stable actually uses the download_docs task
[09:12:59] <rworth> wasn't super suprising, but I wanted to make sure we're merging as much as is needed/reasonable
[09:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, you should be testing in 1-8-stable.
[09:16:03] <rworth> back
[09:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: If you didn't see I said you should be testing with 1-8-stable
[09:16:49] <rworth> got it, yup
[09:59:29] <rwaldron> jzaefferer I'm about to step out for lunch
[09:59:33] <rwaldron> I'll ping you when I get back
