[14:08:01] <cgack> howdy
[14:08:02] <apsdehal_> hi
[14:08:04] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:08:10] <cogwurx> hello!
[14:08:18] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:08:34] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:08:45] <arschmitz> apsdehal_: has started landing his outstanding PR's
[14:08:52] <arschmitz> to get our count down
[14:08:58] <arschmitz> panel is ready to land YAY!
[14:09:02] <apsdehal_> Landing panel at the moment
[14:09:44] <arschmitz> im trying to figure out the failures in table so we can get that landed
[14:09:54] <arschmitz> i have not figured them out yet
[14:10:20] <arschmitz> once i get those figured out next ill look at the issues in the demos PR
[14:10:39] <agcolom> hi
[14:10:40] <jasperdegroot> great
[14:10:40] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-mngR57h54cIOjGDE2Z6LjaiyRgDwlcvKUzZn2Fw6M/edit#gid=154577118
[14:10:44] <arschmitz> cgack: did you have any luck withthe table yet
[14:11:04] <gabrielschulhof> Sorry I didn't have time to help with that :/
[14:11:06] <agcolom> I've updated triage numbers
[14:11:17] <arschmitz> agcolom: thank you
[14:11:26] <cgack> no, i've been under the weather this week unfortunately.
[14:11:37] <arschmitz> cgack: sorry to hear that
[14:11:51] <arschmitz> cgack: let me know if you do figure anything out since im looking at that too
[14:12:06] <cgack> arschmitz: will do.
[14:13:02] <arschmitz> i saw a PR from cogwurx
[14:13:13] <cogwurx> Indeed!
[14:13:16] <arschmitz> and looks like jasperdegroot reviewed already
[14:13:18] <jasperdegroot> :)
[14:13:22] <cogwurx> finally got one through
[14:13:27] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:13:54] <sfrisk> ahh, sorry, I'm late
[14:14:03] <cogwurx> will revisit sometime tomorrow and hopefully knock it out in a couple of days
[14:14:08] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i assume your still just plugging away at demos but waiting on that test issue?
[14:14:17] <arschmitz> cogwurx: sounds great
[14:14:25] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yes
[14:14:42] <jasperdegroot> although I have to admit that I didn't have that much time lately
[14:14:43] <arschmitz> hopefully ill figure out the table issues soon so i can look at that next
[14:14:55] <jasperdegroot> this week I helped cogwirx a bit
[14:15:07] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no problem thanks for helping him get started
[14:15:47] <jasperdegroot> and will do my best to fix as much of the other demos issues before beta
[14:15:52] <arschmitz> so that covers all the main items
[14:16:12] <arschmitz> there is one item that was brought up my a GSoc Student i wanted to bring up
[14:16:38] <arschmitz> which is so we decided to replace vmouse with pep
[14:16:44] <arschmitz> and touch events with hammer.js
[14:16:53] <cogwurx> am very thankful for all your help @jasperdegroot
[14:16:57] <arschmitz> but that leaves a gap with vclick or some other fast click
[14:17:01] <jasperdegroot> :)
[14:17:34] <arschmitz> if we remove all of vmouse we remove vclick with no replacment
[14:17:58] <arschmitz> we could add in a 3rd party fastclick as well
[14:18:21] <jasperdegroot> do we still need it?
[14:18:23] <arschmitz> fastclick is the most common but it has most of the same bugs our vclick does just standalone
[14:18:26] <arschmitz> yes
[14:18:42] <jasperdegroot> https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away?hl=en
[14:19:01] <jasperdegroot> of course there are more browsers than Chrome
[14:19:03] <arschmitz> that does nt help ios
[14:19:22] <arschmitz> they even recomend fastclick at the bottom of that article
[14:19:29] <jasperdegroot> was also reading a bit about touch-action manipulation
[14:19:40] <arschmitz> yes but thats a whole can of works
[14:19:54] <arschmitz> because they are only supporting that one value of touch action
[14:20:03] <arschmitz> and thats not until next ios in fall
[14:20:13] <arschmitz> thats the long term solution
[14:20:55] <arschmitz> hammer does have a stand alone fast click thats also becoming popular
[14:20:59] <arschmitz> used in ember
[14:21:05] <arschmitz> hammer-time
[14:21:13] <arschmitz> it polyfills touch-action css
[14:21:29] <arschmitz> instead of being automatic like fastclick
[14:21:45] <jasperdegroot> in general I prefer polyfills
[14:21:53] <arschmitz> the is a catch
[14:21:55] <jasperdegroot> but don't know hammer-time
[14:22:00] <arschmitz> no support for style sheets
[14:22:11] <arschmitz> because you cant really polyfill css from a stylesheet
[14:22:35] <arschmitz> it only works on styles set in the style attribute directly
[14:22:41] <arschmitz> but thats what pep is switching to also
[14:22:58] <jasperdegroot> I could live with that
[14:23:06] <arschmitz> instead of custom touch-action attribute
[14:23:22] <arschmitz> yeah hammer time was actually a POC for pep's change
[14:23:37] <arschmitz> so once pep updates they will work exactly the same
[14:24:06] <arschmitz> does anyone have any opinions of what we should do for a fast click?
[14:24:51] <gabrielschulhof> Maybe we should just stick with vclick for the time being.
[14:25:06] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: well vclick is part of vmouse
[14:25:09] <gabrielschulhof> We could reduce vmouse to just vclick if we have better solutions for everything else.
[14:25:38] <arschmitz> that means a lot of work for us
[14:25:44] <arschmitz> compared to dropping in something 3rd part
[14:25:44] <apsdehal_> Panel landed
[14:25:52] <jasperdegroot> did we deprecate vmouse already?
[14:25:56] <arschmitz> no
[14:25:56] <jasperdegroot> apsdehal_: awesome!
[14:26:02] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal_: Grats!
[14:26:07] <arschmitz> because it will be replaced by pep
[14:26:14] <arschmitz> so we cant do that until pep is in mobile
[14:26:21] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:26:43] <arschmitz> vlick has many problems also
[14:26:54] <arschmitz> i mean we basicly dont recomend people even use it
[14:27:47] <arschmitz> some advantages of hammer-time over what we have ( and im not as familiar with fast click recent versions ) but there is no possibility of a target mismatch
[14:28:02] <arschmitz> and it also does fast focus so there is not a delay in poping the keyboard
[14:28:19] <arschmitz> i know fast click does not do fast focus
[14:29:17] <jasperdegroot> then we also need fastTapToggle ;)
[14:30:29] <arschmitz> hammer-time being a polyfill is also a no-op on chrome and ie which support touch-action
[14:30:59] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you're involved in hammer.js, right?
[14:31:03] <arschmitz> yes
[14:31:14] <jasperdegroot> I think that's also an advantage
[14:31:30] <arschmitz> full disclaimer i wrote hammer-time completely
[14:31:35] <arschmitz> it was a POC for pep
[14:31:46] <arschmitz> and people asked to make it an actual microlib
[14:31:48] <jasperdegroot> when people report issues we can do something about it
[14:31:54] <arschmitz> yes
[14:32:14] <arschmitz> its in production in many ember apps already too
[14:32:24] <arschmitz> with very positive feedback
[14:32:49] <arschmitz> it replaced fastclick in the ember-touch module
[14:33:09] <jasperdegroot> although I think fastclick is good too, I think I am in favour of this hammer-time solution
[14:33:24] <arschmitz> i have no issue with fastclick in general its the most popular
[14:33:34] <arschmitz> but it can get target mismatches
[14:33:40] <arschmitz> and its not a polyfill
[14:33:50] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:33:52] <arschmitz> and no fast focus
[14:34:00] <arschmitz> i think hammer time is a lot smaller too
[14:34:08] <jasperdegroot> the fact that hammer-time is a polyfill is the reason I am in favour of that one
[14:34:15] <arschmitz> 417B lol
[14:34:43] <arschmitz> yeah that was the idea is this is already a solved problem
[14:34:49] <jasperdegroot> does hammer time depend on hammer.js?
[14:34:49] <arschmitz> touch-action is the right way to do this
[14:34:52] <arschmitz> no
[14:34:57] <arschmitz> its standalone
[14:34:58] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:35:30] <arschmitz> https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer-time
[14:36:21] <arschmitz> we dont need to decide this today
[14:36:40] <arschmitz> i just wanted to bring it up that there was a gap in our plans as pointed out by a GSoC student
[14:37:50] <jasperdegroot> this discussion was the reason why I wondered if we still need vclick https://gist.github.com/gajus/bbf06ea2e37047b01e70#gistcomment-1703639
[14:38:39] <arschmitz> safari did not fully remove
[14:38:45] <arschmitz> its not just double tap
[14:39:23] <arschmitz> plus old browsers
[14:39:52] <arschmitz> this is not even in any released version of iOS
[14:40:09] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:40:33] <arschmitz> though i think its a good reason to use a polyfill in general
[14:40:41] <arschmitz> the fast this is becoming increasingly unnessasarry
[14:40:56] <jasperdegroot> yes agreed
[14:41:43] <arschmitz> ok so i think thats all i have for this week
[14:41:50] <arschmitz> does anyone else have anything?
[14:42:36] <jasperdegroot> I am good
[14:42:39] <cgack> i'm good
[14:45:50] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back on -dev
