[09:00:58] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:00] <kborchers> hi
[09:01:16] <tj_vantoll> Here (but on a plane so crappy wifi)
[09:01:57] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: aka "Here (despite being on a plane!!!1"
[09:02:11] <tj_vantoll> lol
[09:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything to discuss this week?
[09:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> DB or Globalize
[09:02:53] <rxaviers> I've been working on the Globalize's number module...
[09:03:05] <rxaviers> To be more specific, in the significant figures format
[09:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> Any roadblocks?
[09:03:40] <rxaviers> numbers can be formatted using two mutual exclusive formats: integer and fraction format (eg. #,##0.00###), and
[09:04:01] <rxaviers> significant formats (eg. ##@@), which is more commonly used for scientific number format.
[09:04:37] <rxaviers> integer and fraction format is pretty much done, and significant formats are giving me a little more trouble.
[09:06:10] <rxaviers> I've been able to implement it using Number.prototype.toPrecision(). Although, it doesn't let me to arbitrarily round the number the way I want (it always round to the nearest neighbor). Spec says implementation should allow override for other types (eg. ceil, floor). By the way, the integer and fraction implementation does allow that.
[09:06:24] <rxaviers> So, I need to re-implement it using another algo.
[09:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you look into how spinner handles rounding and see if we'll be able to clean that up at all?
[09:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/spinner.js#L334 for what I'm referring to.
[09:07:27] <rxaviers> ah! sure. Although, I have looked into a lot of implementation (eg. dojo, which doesnt implement significant numbers), I havent looked at spinner.
[09:07:44] <rxaviers> s/significant numbers/significant figures/
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's very closely tied to the spinner's step option, I'm not sure if we'll be able to take advantage of anything in Globalize.
[09:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess also with Globalize being optional for spinner, we can't rely on it anyway.
[09:08:35] <rxaviers> will check and let you know my findings.
[09:08:38] <rxaviers> Other than that, unicode has fixed a couple of doc bugs I'd opened: http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/6788 http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/6790 http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/6849 http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/7001ï»¿
[09:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's just annoying that we had to write these methods: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/spinner.js#L320-L332
[09:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> Which I instantly thought of when you mentioned rounding :-P
[09:09:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, but significant numbers are a little different. You are talking about decimal precision right?
[09:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> Great. Improved docs are always good.
[09:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: yeah
[09:10:10] <rxaviers> re docs: yeap! It's awesome! :D
[09:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like you're making good progress.
[09:11:21] <rxaviers> significant figures precision (what toPrecision() does) is like (12345).toPrecision(3) = 12300
[09:11:35] <rxaviers> or (0.12345).toPrecision(3) = 0.123
[09:11:54] <rxaviers> or (0.000012345).toPrecision(3) = 0.0000123
[09:12:31] <rxaviers> I need to update https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/200 with the current status
[09:12:47] <rxaviers> ops actually: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/209
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[09:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I have been making good progress on jquery-release updates.
[09:15:13] <jzaefferer> Making a fake-project so that its much quicker to test changes in jquery-release
[09:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> We've added some safety checks upfront.
[09:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> Checking for required executables: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/40
[09:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> Verifying npm credentials: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/36
[09:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> We've added the ability to specify release-specifc dependencies within a project: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/35
[09:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> This allows us to avoid having every dev install the deps if they're only needed for the release.
[09:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> We also made a change so that Release.exec() aborts on failure.
[09:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/39
[09:17:17] <scott_gonzalez> Which removes a lot of redundant code.
[09:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> We've got PRs for all the projects to update their release scripts.
[09:17:59] <tj_vantoll> Awesome.
[09:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> We'll continue working through issues making the process more reliable and adding in any missing parts for the UI release.
[09:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:19:53] <jzaefferer> I hope to have a unit test for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1210 soon
[09:20:17] <jzaefferer> I've ran the testsuite with browserstack-runner, which by now works pretty well and has reasonable output
[09:20:48] <jzaefferer> I hope they'll address this soon, that'll make it even better: https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner/issues/51
[09:25:09] <rxaviers> Re checks: awesome
[09:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess that's it.
[09:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> See everyone back in -dev.
