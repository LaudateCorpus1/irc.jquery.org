[08:39:25] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: yes
[08:39:32] <jzaefferer> Its been a while since our last meeting: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FbWhiFQ9gWQvB1Tm4QM_OC4me-ha2ujDWH5sdF7ueo/edit
[08:39:44] <JamesMGreene> Indeed
[08:40:31] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Did you get a chance to look into https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/217 ?
[08:40:46] <JamesMGreene> So as far as my availability goes, I figured out a schedule that should at least allow me to get back into QUnit at a slow but steady rate of >= 2 hours per week
[08:41:00] <jzaefferer> Last I heard from you on that was this: "Should be a relatively small change, but requires figuring out how this all works together. The rerun stuff always has been a bit fragile."
[08:41:02] <JamesMGreene> (starting next week)
[08:41:35] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: Sounds good. With Leo implementing lots of things, its always good to have someone around to do reviews.
[08:41:52] <leobalter> reviews <3
[08:42:03] <JamesMGreene> <3 leobalter implementing lots of things
[08:42:56] <leobalter> regarding the reviews: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/540#issuecomment-45106446
[08:42:59] <jzaefferer> For example, I haven't loooked at https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/588 yet
[08:43:53] <leobalter> About #588: It's a small step, only part of the process. I don't want to hurry that up and modify everything in a single PR
[08:44:12] <jzaefferer> "a lib this out of touch with modern testing needs" thanks for the kind words
[08:45:06] <jzaefferer> Did any of those libs complain about our lack of non-browser env support? I still have the impression that this is a purely theoretical discussion
[08:46:20] <leobalter> Returning to #540, let's close that and ask for what's JDalton suggested, baby steps with a solid implementation for Browser and Node
[08:50:11] <jzaefferer> leobalter: Scott has replied to jdalton, we can keep that open a little longer
[08:51:52] <JamesMGreene> Browser + Node are obviously way more important than all the rest
[08:52:33] <JamesMGreene> jdalton is just used to working on niche language-level (and usually not DOM-related) libraries that CAN realistically run on all JS runtimes
[08:52:58] <JamesMGreene> It's not a bad thing, just a bias of his
[08:53:43] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Not yet.
[08:53:46] <JamesMGreene> I can't picture why Backbone or WinJS would care
[08:53:59] <JamesMGreene> Underscore and Lo-Dash are somewhat realistic, though
[08:54:29] <jzaefferer> leobalter has been talking about supporting node CLI usage, which I'm open to. Dalton's qunit-extras seems to do that, but the "Usage" in his readme doesn't suggest a simple to use implementation
[08:54:53] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Okay. Would be good to get that implemented
[08:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, qunit-extras looks like it's trying to hack in support for a browser-only version of QUnit.
[08:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's mocking lots of stuff that doesn't look necessary if proper node support exists.
[08:55:47] <mikesherov_> hi
[08:56:07] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer leobalter: Is there an issue filed for the CLI usage thing? I'm not sure I understand what we would expect such usage to look like
[08:56:07] <scott_gonzalez> Hey mikesherov_. Just finishing up the testing meeting.
[08:56:09] <JamesMGreene> hi mikesherov_
[08:56:17] <mikesherov_> k, I'll wait :-)
[08:56:54] <leobalter> JamesMGreene jzaefferer: I want to finish the reporter implementation before going to CLI usage
[08:57:33] <leobalter> #588 is also important to refactor the reporter interface. We have to make it async as the assertion obj
[08:57:48] <jzaefferer> leobalter: makes sense
[08:58:35] <leobalter> for the CLI I'm really considering a TAP implementation (also for reporting at console)
[09:00:14] <JamesMGreene> sure
[09:00:42] <JamesMGreene> Any final comments for QUnit/TestSwarm?
[09:01:33] <kborchers> get out of our way testers ;)
[09:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz fnagel gnarf kborchers mikesherov_ petersendidit rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:01:48] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:49] <rxaviers> Hi
[09:01:58] <mikesherov_> hi hi
[09:02:20] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you want to start with Globalize?
[09:03:16] <rxaviers> sure, I have been working on some things in parallel. My main focus this week has been to improve error handling
[09:03:36] <rxaviers> I've mimicked your approach in DEBT and updated the error branch in Globalize.
[09:03:44] <arschmitz> hi
[09:04:00] <rxaviers> Now, parameters are validated. I'm implementing the checks for CLDR content as well.
[09:04:10] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/251
[09:04:49] <rxaviers> I hope Alex Sexton was here, so we could discuss the Message Format.
[09:05:06] <rxaviers> But, it doesnt look like.
[09:05:36] <rxaviers> I have also gone through a bunch of past opened issues and closed every closable ones.
[09:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to schedule some time to talk about error handling with DaveMethvin|away
[09:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> I saw that :-)
[09:06:14] <rxaviers> more precisely #51, #73, #74, #81, #82, #88, #93, #97, #103, #110, #113, #120, #121, #125, #129, #130, #132, #134, #135, #137, #139, #141, #144, #148, #155, #176
[09:06:15] <rxaviers> :)
[09:06:31] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, oh nice. I'd be really interested in knowing the outcome
[09:06:47] <rxaviers> or to listen to the talk
[09:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> When I get a hold of him, I'll let you know.
[09:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> I think he's still traveling.
[09:08:01] <rxaviers> ok thks
[09:08:08] <rxaviers> About this Improve error handling only remaining ticket in 1.0.0 milestone
[09:08:29] <rxaviers> It has changed actually. I've added some more items to the 1.0.0 milestone, which I thought was important having.
[09:08:55] <rxaviers> So, the list has grown a little
[09:08:56] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues?milestone=1&state=open
[09:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to get a final decision on the polyfills too.
[09:09:44] <rxaviers> thanks
[09:10:57] <rxaviers> Most of the added tickets are small fixes/improvements or stuff that I wanted to double check about cross browser compat.
[09:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel arschmitz: Did either of you hear back about selectmenu accessibility?
[09:11:39] <arschmitz> nothing yet
[09:12:47] <arschmitz> jsconf was this week though so a lot of people may have been there
[09:13:40] <fnagel> Dylan will take a look soon
[09:13:46] <fnagel> He replied to my email
[09:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> I think we'll aim for a final release next week.
[09:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we implement any major changes, like selectmenu accessibility or close on scroll.
[09:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then we'll do an rc.
[09:19:30] <jzaefferer> I think rxaviers is working on fixing DB logging, so we should get some actual numbers soon
[09:19:49] <jzaefferer> right now I can't tell if adding beta.2 to DB made any difference
[09:21:07] <rxaviers> will let you know as soon as I figure what's wrong on the logs
[09:23:30] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:23:42] <fnagel> I've got some news regarding Datepicker: I've already splitted the functionality in a Calendar and a Datepicker widget.
[09:23:45] <mikesherov_> yes
[09:24:00] <mikesherov_> Just wanted to mention that I've been mostly working on JSCS for the past few months
[09:24:22] <mikesherov_> looking to get back into more active development, hoping to finally finish up effects rewrite after 1.11 lands
[09:24:39] <mikesherov_> for sure though, JSCS 1.5 will be out this week
[09:24:48] <mikesherov_> and should be good to use on all jQuery projects
[09:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: That's great. I've been waiting for this release.
[09:25:52] <mikesherov_> me too
[09:26:03] <mikesherov_> after 1.5 we start work on 2.0, which will have autofixing in it
[09:26:13] <mikesherov_> at least for whitespace rules
[09:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Can you push your work into the datepicker branch?
[09:26:39] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer: I've used a "Calendar: xyz..." prefix for some commit messages and would add PRs for datepicker branch, ok?
[09:26:40] <mikesherov_> anyway, just wanted to once again apologize for my lack of activity
[09:26:46] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: aahh too slow
[09:26:48] <mikesherov_> finding it hard to find balance
[09:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: No problem. We've all gone though that.
[09:28:10] <mikesherov_> yup. new job + new babies + an additional project makes it tough to find time for jQuery, but that *should* change soon enough
[09:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, looks like that's it.
[09:30:11] <mikesherov_> gotta run. bye all!
[09:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
[09:31:23] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: looking forward to the updated jQuery preset and eventually autofixing
