[12:04:40] <fnagel> hey
[12:05:20] <arschmitz> hi
[12:05:24] <jzaefferer> hello
[12:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz finally merged his docs update from two weeks ago :-)
[12:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/297
[12:07:18] <arschmitz> i did!
[12:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I assume you still need help with menu styling.
[12:09:13] <jzaefferer> yeah
[12:09:22] <jzaefferer> I haven't looked into that again
[12:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> Let's work on that tomorrow morning ET?
[12:10:33] <jzaefferer> Friday would be better
[12:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to RTL support.
[12:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1682
[12:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ahmed sent a PR, but none of the changes were actually needed.
[12:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> He's now working on autocomplete, but that has some big issues too.
[12:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> Like hard-coding a menu position (i.e., ignoring the position option).
[12:13:26] <arschmitz> iv been looking at widgets
[12:13:32] <arschmitz> and it seems like for the most part
[12:13:45] <arschmitz> all we need to do is add the attribute to remote content
[12:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> I really wouldn't be surprised if that's the majority of the work.
[12:14:17] <arschmitz> there are some small execptions but for the most part thats it
[12:14:32] <arschmitz> the changes in 1.12 fixed like 95% of this already
[12:15:08] <arschmitz> for the most part as long as you dont want bidi and just want rtl 1.12 works
[12:15:13] <jzaefferer> What's remote content in this context?
[12:15:25] <arschmitz> things like popup for selectmenu or autocomplete
[12:15:46] <arschmitz> where they wont be guranteed in the same direction context as the widget element
[12:16:14] <arschmitz> so like if you just set it on the body your good
[12:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> Usually it's generated content.
[12:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog wrapper, autocomplete menu, etc.
[12:16:31] <arschmitz> yup exactly
[12:16:50] <arschmitz> tooltips could be a big one
[12:17:12] <arschmitz> this is where bidi vs just rtl comes into play
[12:19:01] <arschmitz> its relly really simple to do
[12:19:07] <arschmitz> you can see it in the autocomplete pr
[12:19:31] <arschmitz> beyond that i think its mostly tweaks for demo specific and not widgets
[12:19:41] <arschmitz> like he switched the icon to face other direction
[12:19:50] <arschmitz> which im still not sure is correct
[12:20:00] <arschmitz> since "play" icons shouldnt be reversed
[12:20:39] <arschmitz> one way to improve this might be to change the default icon to "+" and "-"
[12:21:07] <arschmitz> its what we do in mobile
[12:21:24] <scott_gonzalez> I prefer the arrows.
[12:21:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather have RTL users just change their default.
[12:21:45] <arschmitz> im fine with that
[12:24:02] <arschmitz> i think datepicker will be most work here by far
[12:25:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm sure a lot of that will run through Globalize though.
[12:26:16] <arschmitz> yup
[12:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[13:01:44] <agcolom> Good evening/afternoon content team!
[13:01:54] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[13:02:21] <agcolom> zz_AurelioDeRosa: kswedberg arthurvr
[13:03:10] <kswedberg> hey there!
[13:03:34] <agcolom> hey Karl!
[13:04:20] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/702
[13:04:30] <agcolom> Ithink this is a good point and we should add this
[13:04:36] <agcolom> what do you think?
[13:05:37] <kswedberg> agcolom: Is he talking about another example? something like $( ".myClass, .yourClass" ); ?
[13:05:42] <agcolom> yes
[13:06:00] <kswedberg> ah, I see. yeah, makes sense to me.
[13:06:28] <agcolom> great. I can probably come up with a PR this week or next week :-)
[13:07:21] <kswedberg> awesome. also, there's some old/incorrect info on that page.
[13:07:58] <kswedberg> like this: $( "a[rel$='thinger']" ); … While these can be useful in a pinch, they can also be extremely slow in older browsers.
[13:08:29] <agcolom> oh, ok, so that should be removed?
[13:08:33] <kswedberg> with querySelectorAll, it's not really that slow to do something like that.
[13:09:54] <kswedberg> yeah, probably. also, all the examples in the pseudo-selectors section use jQuery custom selectors. (:visible, etc.) Those are the ones that we should warn about.
[13:10:14] <agcolom> ok, so basically we should just keep it simple?
[13:10:21] <kswedberg> But we should also distinguish between jQuery custom selectors and valid CSS pseudo-selectors (like :nth-child)
[13:10:42] <agcolom> yes, I'm thinking it might be best if you could do this PR?
[13:10:59] <kswedberg> ok, sure. it kind of needs an overhaul.
[13:11:11] <kswedberg> is there another issue for that page?
[13:11:15] <agcolom> brilliant!
[13:11:37] <agcolom> no, I think this is the only one for that page I can think of. I can check though
[13:12:57] <agcolom> now, regarding https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/701
[13:13:21] <agcolom> I've asked the user whether the suggestion by Dave solves his issue.
[13:14:10] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/693
[13:14:17] <agcolom> I have no idea :-(
[13:14:33] <agcolom> who would be the best person to ping about this?
[13:15:13] <kswedberg> I think Dave's suggestion is a good one.
[13:15:17] <kswedberg> for 701
[13:15:52] <agcolom> right, good
[13:18:36] <agcolom> We should also decide what to do about https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/693
[13:18:45] <agcolom> that's regarding https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[13:19:18] <kswedberg> ? looks like "Deferred example suggestion " to me
[13:19:47] <kswedberg> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/697 ?
[13:19:51] <agcolom> oh yes, sorry ;-)
[13:20:12] <agcolom> yes, that's the one.
[13:20:34] <agcolom> so do we know who we should ask about the deffered example suggestion?
[13:20:36] <agcolom> Dave?
[13:20:45] <agcolom> deferred
[13:22:29] <agcolom> so that's Q1
[13:22:36] <agcolom> and Q2 is
[13:22:40] <agcolom> that's regarding https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[13:23:20] <kswedberg> hmm. I understand what's going on in 693, but it's a weird example, I think. since $.getScript already returns an "enhanced" promise, there isn't much need for that $.Deferred(). But if all we need to do is explain what defer.resolve and defer.reject do, it should be easy enough
[13:26:02] <agcolom> ok. that sounds good
[13:28:22] <kswedberg> agcolom: Tell you what… I'll take a crack and fixing those three issues this weekend. If you don't see any activity from me, please remind me?
[13:28:33] <kswedberg> take a crack at*
[13:29:38] <agcolom> fantstic! thanks
[13:30:30] <agcolom> ok the rest was just straight forward things just for info
[13:30:56] <kswedberg> ok. any idea if api.jquery.com is getting updated yet? some serious issues with that.
[13:31:17] <agcolom> I'm not aware of things working
[13:31:35] <kswedberg> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/890
[13:32:49] <agcolom> Yes, that's bad
[13:34:44] <agcolom> I've not deployed anything to api.jquerymobile.com in a while so I don't know whether that is affected as well
[13:36:12] <agcolom> interesting about the period issue (v.1.xx instead of v1.xx )
[13:38:05] <kswedberg> yeah, that's unrelated to the bigger problem. but interesting, yeah. I think that was just a typo
[13:40:49] <agcolom> I've checked and I'm still running an old version
[13:40:53] <agcolom> so I'm getting Warning: Mismatching versions for Gilded WordPress. Version 1.0.2 is installed as a Node.js module, but the WordPress server is running version 1.0.0. Use --force to continue.
[13:41:17] <agcolom> so I guess I could/should update jquery-wp-content?
[13:41:50] <agcolom> but since I haven't does that mean that if I can force push it could be successful? (that's me kind of dreaming!)
[13:44:10] <kswedberg> no idea. :) maybe scott_gonzalez knows.
[13:45:01] <agcolom> I'm not getting the updated changes locally
[13:45:42] <kswedberg> hmmm
[13:46:39] <agcolom> but then I'm getting warning along the way as well...
[13:46:51] <agcolom> I was checking that the entry on val was up to date
[13:47:22] <agcolom> yes, on stage as well it's not updated
[13:47:25] <kswedberg> that build/deploy stuff is beyond me.
[13:47:53] <agcolom> me too
[13:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> You need to update jquery-wp-content.
[13:48:41] <kswedberg> hey scott_gonzalez ! is it fixed now?
[13:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> No, api.jquery.com is a separate issue.
[13:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait is agcolom not talking about local?
[13:49:16] <agcolom> I'm talking about local
[13:49:44] <kswedberg> so scott_gonzalez : api.jquery.com should work *locally*?
[13:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> No, api.jquery.com is just broken.
[13:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know why.
[13:50:38] <kswedberg> :'-(
[13:51:23] <agcolom> I've just update jquery-wp-content
[13:51:27] <agcolom> and now I'm getting
[13:51:28] <agcolom> FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - process out of memory
[13:51:30] <agcolom> :-(
[13:51:39] <agcolom> is it my computer?
[13:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's happening on api.jquery.com or api.jquerymobile.com?
[13:52:35] <agcolom> api.jquery.com
[13:52:54] <agcolom> I've just quit all the apps I could quit
[13:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquery.com won't deploy anywhere.
[13:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's broken.
[13:53:23] <agcolom> yes
[13:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's been broken for a while.
[13:53:41] <agcolom> same error?
[13:53:54] <agcolom> sorry same error
[13:55:17] <agcolom> trying with api.jquerymobile.com
[13:55:27] <agcolom> wow
[13:55:28] <agcolom> Segmentation fault: 11
[13:55:56] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: do you think you can figure this out, given sufficient time? Or is there someone else who might be able to?
[13:56:54] <agcolom> arschmitz: Are you able to deploy api.jquerymobile.com or is that broken for you too?
[13:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> Probably, but honestly this isn't something I planned on spending time on.
[13:57:08] <arschmitz> agcolom: i have not tried recently
[13:57:14] <agcolom> I'm getting Segmentation fault: 11 :-( when trying to deploy locally
[13:58:39] <arschmitz> agcolom: are you using vagrant? i think we upgraded wordpress
[13:58:46] <agcolom> no I'm not
[13:58:54] <arschmitz> which means the wordpress in our vagrant box no longer matches the one on servers
[13:59:08] <agcolom> I updated jquery-wp-content
[13:59:40] <arschmitz> right but that does not effect wordpress version
[13:59:44] <agcolom> ok
[14:00:19] <agcolom> so I need to update my wordpress?
[14:00:31] <arschmitz> possible im not sure what you have vs whats on servers
[14:01:00] <arschmitz> agcolom: so to be clear your not using the vagrant box we recommend in the contributing?
[14:01:15] <agcolom> No I don't think so
[14:01:32] <agcolom> I've got the local setup that scott_gonzalez installed on my machine
[14:03:13] <agcolom> kswedberg: Thanks for everything. I think we're ok now for the meeting content. Obviously now issues regarding the deployment of the sites...
[14:03:45] <kswedberg> no prob agcolom . gotta run. ttyl!
[14:03:51] <arschmitz> in October there were 3 commits to support new wordpress
[14:03:59] <agcolom> see you later
[14:04:02] <arschmitz> not sure those were backward compatible
[14:04:18] <agcolom> ok
[14:04:21] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commits/master
[14:05:37] <agcolom> right so before I update jquery-wp-content, I got this error:
[14:05:38] <agcolom> Version 1.0.2 is installed as a Node.js module, but the WordPress server is running version 1.0.0.
[14:12:45] <agcolom> ok so should I try to use vagrant and update everything
[14:12:47] <agcolom> ?
[14:12:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz ^
[14:14:39] <arschmitz> versions 1.0.2 of what?
[14:14:59] <arschmitz> vagrant wont be up to date
[14:15:04] <arschmitz> its several years old
[14:15:20] <agcolom> Warning: Mismatching versions for Gilded WordPress. Version 1.0.2 is installed as a Node.js module, but the WordPress server is running version 1.0.0. Use --force to continue.
[14:17:36] <agcolom> arschmitz: If I go to http://local.api.jquery.com/readme.html
[14:18:00] <agcolom> it's saying I'm using wordpress 4.1
[14:19:04] <arschmitz> agcolom: im not sure
[14:20:24] <agcolom> it'd be good I think to find out whether the segmentation fault is a pb on my side or with the repo
[14:26:05] <agcolom> I guess we should discuss this outside of this meeting...
[14:26:10] <agcolom> thanks
[14:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> vagrant is not several years old.
