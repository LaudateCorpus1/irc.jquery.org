[10:37:01] <gnarf> Anyone looking for the content meeting
[10:37:04] <gnarf> its going to happen
[10:37:10] <gnarf> people are just running late
[10:37:42] <gnarf> cc ajpiano rworth danheberden agcolom kswedberg ... etc (dunno who i missed ;) )
[10:37:48] <ajpiano> hey al
[10:37:51] <rworth> hey
[10:38:26] <ajpiano> sooo, content meeting
[10:38:45] <ajpiano> we launched a lot of new sites yesterday, so that's awesome
[10:39:13] <ajpiano> we are still running a bit behind on learn, i think i will do it next week (the official launch)
[10:39:15] <gnarf> ajpiano: do you have an agenda link?
[10:39:28] <ajpiano> nope
[10:39:36] <ajpiano> we haven't really had... agendas
[10:40:12] <ajpiano> usually just a quick spin through what's going on
[10:40:42] <gnarf> coo
[10:41:14] <ajpiano> but i think we should do a tag on learn, cause it's already "live" and just broken looking
[10:41:16] <gnarf> I'm just curious where we are at with our "release plan" for the new sites
[10:41:49] <ajpiano> we're in pretty good shape, the only thing that's behind is learn, as i've been busy this week in boston and dealing with the other sites lauch
[10:41:57] <ajpiano> we're on track to launch the portland event site tomorrow
[10:42:19] <ajpiano> oh and jquery.org
[10:42:37] <ajpiano> which rworth is heading up right now
[10:43:01] <rworth> yeah, I've got a new plan for /join, will get it by Mon
[10:43:11] <ajpiano> but we'll still have 3 announcements this week, yesterday's site launch, today qunit, tomorrow the event
[10:43:20] <rworth> still have to do a bunch of content stuff, so we could launch sometime between Tue-Thu
[10:43:30] <rworth> only advantage to Thu is I'd be back from training (M-W)
[10:43:55] <ajpiano> it will be hard to do jquery.org w/o you and would it be done before then anyway
[10:44:06] <ajpiano> rworth: i actualyl kind of wanted to bikeshed the .org color one more time
[10:44:07] <ajpiano> :/
[10:44:24] <rworth> yeah
[10:44:27] <ajpiano> Regarding the use of the navy for jQuery overall, we still recommend keeping it simple and only using the light blue and dark blue provided. Adding a second dark blue could complicate things, so we recommend that both jQuery and jQuery Foundation use the same two colors.
[10:44:35] <rworth> umm, yeah that color has been buggin me all morning
[10:44:39] <ajpiano> i asked them about whether we shoudl include the navy int eh brand guide etc
[10:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Here's a bikeshed for you: http://www.the-top-tens.com/lists/ugliest-colors.asp
[10:44:48] <ajpiano> rworth: you don't mind it in the membership logo stuff, do you?
[10:45:05] <ajpiano> so i'm not really crazy about using the same blue for .com and .org
[10:45:22] <rworth> let's do a call after this if you're available
[10:45:42] <ajpiano> i'm gonna be getting picked up by rwaldron in a bit to head back to nyc, not sure when i'll be available to
[10:45:48] <ajpiano> but i can talk on the phone i guess about it as well
[10:45:53] <rworth> ok
[10:45:57] <rworth> call me
[10:45:58] <ajpiano> i was kinda thinking we could go with the grey
[10:45:59] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano I've been working on the content for the learn site.  I've got a couple of PR in.  One that starts a jQuery UI section and once that lands I can work on bringing over some of the other jQuery Ui content listed in the issues.
[10:47:14] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano also trying to work with agcolom and toddmparker on the jquerymobile.com contnet and figure out how to tackle it.  I'll mention that in the JQM meeting next hour.
[10:47:31] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: yeah i saw those PRs late last night, haven't had a chance to review yet
[10:47:44] <RWhitbeck> no worries
[10:47:55] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: the thing that comes to mind is removing any overlap between the "new" jquery ui articles and this http://stage.learn.jquery.com/plugins/stateful-plugins-with-widget-factory/
[10:48:12] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: do you think we're gonna launch portland on web-events at this point?
[10:48:22] <ajpiano> i mean rworth
[10:48:33] <RWhitbeck> whew I was like "Yes?"
[10:48:34] <rworth> yes
[10:48:47] <ajpiano> okey doke
[10:48:56] <rworth> ajpiano gnarf is waiting to hear back from you on whether this means we no longer need redirects
[10:49:06] <rworth> caus I think that's what it means, but I wanted to doublecheck
[10:49:25] <ajpiano> i mean, in the short term it means we don't need them
[10:49:32] <ajpiano> but it also means we'd have to switch the dns back
[10:50:38] <rworth> hmm
[10:50:45] <ajpiano> i really hate being on web-events much longer
[10:50:53] <rworth> let's do events.
[10:50:56] <rworth> we can do it
[10:51:08] <ajpiano> do what?
[10:51:14] <rworth> portland on events.
[10:51:17] <ajpiano> get it on static content for tomorrow
[10:51:23] <ajpiano> ok
[10:51:28] <rworth> it's 3 static pages and their resources
[10:51:33] <ajpiano> ok
[10:51:38] <ajpiano> what about the events index page
[10:51:57] <rworth> shouldn't be much to do there
[10:51:58] <ajpiano> that's redirected as well?
[10:52:06] <ajpiano> right now it's going to the old server though
[10:52:17] <rworth> it is, but we can port it over. Might just need a class/id change or two for new-css
[10:52:19] <rworth> but nothing big
[10:52:28] <ajpiano> ok
[10:52:43] <ajpiano> well it'll need the logo, and the jquery.org color
[10:52:46] <ajpiano> but indeed, nothing big
[10:52:47] <rworth> will you have time tonight we can work on it together?
[10:52:57] <ajpiano> i won't
[10:53:07] <ajpiano> traveling today and not gonna be online :/
[10:53:13] <rworth> how bout in the morning
[10:53:19] <ajpiano> morning yep
[10:53:22] <rworth> cool
[10:53:35] <rworth> I'll do what I can and we'll wrap up in the morning. gotta go live at 12noon ET
[10:53:59] <ajpiano> right.... see how far you can get it tonight and we'll go from there in the AM
[10:55:03] <ajpiano> i think it's better than doing web-events, at least
[10:55:06] <ajpiano> ok so in other news
[10:55:29] <ajpiano> we should be getting a beta from code school on the 29th
[10:55:44] <ajpiano> so we'll be able to review that next week and figure out when it will really be ready to launch
[10:56:54] <ajpiano> and also scott_gonzalez is going to be adding some auto anchor generation to our markdown files
[10:57:01] <ajpiano> so that our headers are linkable exactly like github
[10:57:26] <ajpiano> we also have to figure out where to link the error.log on plugins.jquery.com
[10:59:14] <ajpiano> if at all
[10:59:45] <RWhitbeck> is there a troubleshooting section on the instructions page?
[10:59:54] <RWhitbeck> could go there if so
[11:00:35] <ajpiano> if there isn't, we should add one and put it there
[11:00:49] <RWhitbeck> there is one on Publishing your plugin page
[11:01:00] <RWhitbeck> would need some rewriting.
[11:01:14] <ajpiano> yeah, we can add it in there
[11:01:35] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:01:37] <ajpiano> i can take care of it
[11:01:42] <ajpiano> oh hey toddmparker it's time for your meeting
[11:01:50] <toddmparker> GET OUTTA HERE
[11:01:51] <ajpiano> SO THAT'S IT content folks.... it's meeting time for jqm
[11:01:54] <ajpiano> NO U
[11:02:17] <toddmparker> it's ok, we'll all mull around outside the meeting room and glare at your sandwich platters
[11:02:36] <rworth> don't touch my cookie
[11:02:41] <toddmparker> no worries if you need a few minutes to wrap up
[11:02:45] <rworth> we're done
[11:02:47] <ajpiano> nah i think we're good
[11:02:54] <ajpiano> we can keep talking in -content
[11:02:54] <toddmparker> hey fellas!
[11:03:29] <toddmparker> maybe someday, we can build another conference room on irc
[11:03:34] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:03:42] <toddmparker> hi
[11:03:59] <toddmparker> ok, the jQuery Mobile meeting is starting up
[11:04:06] <toddmparker> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z5c_thFDEAvHS3ga5JYEsg7EuOho7-fiq27b4lky9HQ/edit#
[11:04:14] <arschmitz> hi
[11:04:23] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Sorry I'm late!
[11:04:57] <RWhitbeck> hi
[11:06:26] <toddmparker> hey gang
[11:06:35] <toddmparker> anyone feel a burning need to go first?
[11:07:14] <toddmparker> no?
[11:07:15] <toddmparker> ok
[11:07:25] <RWhitbeck> I'll go if no vols
[11:07:34] <toddmparker> go for it RWhitbeck
[11:08:12] <RWhitbeck> Need to work with agcolom and toddmparker on a content plan for the new jQuerymobile.com
[11:08:24] <RWhitbeck> what would work best to coordinate?
[11:09:11] <toddmparker> good question, i don't think agcolom is here
[11:09:25] <toddmparker> mind sending the 3 of us an emails RWhitbeck
[11:09:34] <toddmparker> let's set up a time to huddle
[11:09:43] <RWhitbeck> will doâ€¦I think I have agcolom
[11:09:47] <RWhitbeck> secondly
[11:09:49] <toddmparker> really appreciate help with that
[11:09:52] <RWhitbeck> Would like to put some effort into working on the learn site content with Anne-Gaelle
[11:09:52] <RWhitbeck> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/189
[11:09:52] <b-ot> RWhitbeck, issue #189 by agcolom (2mon 2w ago): Create a series of guides for getting started with jQuery Mobile
[11:10:02] <toddmparker> cool
[11:10:21] <RWhitbeck> so that's what I've been doing.
[11:10:23] <toddmparker> i want to also talk about content strategy in general
[11:10:36] <RWhitbeck> ok awesome.
[11:10:39] <toddmparker> in the new demos site, i have an articles place
[11:10:56] <toddmparker> but if there is too much overlap with learn, we can nix that section
[11:11:51] <toddmparker> we have a bunch of stuff in the current docs that needs a home
[11:12:09] <RWhitbeck> fyi bbjam europe is in a week or so and Jason and I will be doing a joint jQM talk together
[11:12:18] <toddmparker> cool
[11:12:21] <toddmparker> what topic?
[11:12:52] <RWhitbeck> Me: General State of the Project, Jason: How to get it to work in BB10
[11:12:54] <toddmparker> man, that BB10 rending bug is a doozy, Eli mentioned it to me, but wow.
[11:13:01] <toddmparker> nice
[11:13:20] <RWhitbeck> uGoMobi are you in Amsterdam?
[11:13:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:13:29] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: like your eyes on the new demos site too
[11:13:34] <uGoMobi> I was about to say we  should meet
[11:13:35] <RWhitbeck> would love to meet up while I am there.
[11:13:43] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:13:45] <uGoMobi> for sure
[11:13:52] <toddmparker> i'll be in vienna
[11:14:08] <toddmparker> anyoneâ€¦bueller?
[11:15:01] <toddmparker> so on the topic of demos, i've been trying to hammer that out so we can get help with production
[11:15:06] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[11:15:12] <uGoMobi> really nice toddmparker !
[11:15:17] <toddmparker> thanks
[11:15:28] <toddmparker> so all API info will live on the new API site
[11:16:05] <toddmparker> but here, I want to have a simple widget list that shows off the options with easy copy/paste code - see buttons
[11:16:06] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/
[11:16:34] <toddmparker> if you tap the menu button in the header, you'll see the list of widget pages I want to write
[11:16:48] <toddmparker> most is porting demos and docs into this simpler format
[11:17:22] <uGoMobi> I can work on getting the other example/reference pages in same shape as buttons next week
[11:17:31] <toddmparker> and listing things as how people might look for 'em. for example, we have "accordion" that is really the collapsible set but new people wouldn't know where to look
[11:17:44] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: awesome, i'll jam on it to
[11:17:50] <uGoMobi> great
[11:18:00] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck and others - if you have time, it's pretty straightforward
[11:18:05] <toddmparker> if you want to help
[11:18:11] <RWhitbeck> yeah count me in.
[11:18:24] <toddmparker> the second big area is this Q&A section - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/faq/
[11:18:49] <toddmparker> only the first item is linked - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/faq/question-template.html
[11:18:57] <toddmparker> just so we have a tempalte
[11:18:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ill take care of all the ones that are there now of course
[11:19:05] <toddmparker> this is arschmitz's idea
[11:19:40] <toddmparker> i hope we can reach out to knowledgeable people and encourage them to contribute by grabbing that template and making a PR
[11:19:47] <RWhitbeck> is there anyway we can track this as issues?
[11:20:06] <toddmparker> so if you now people that blogged about jQuery Mobile or help in forums/irc, ask them to write some of these
[11:20:12] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: interesting idea
[11:20:19] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: its part of the library so they can file an issue right on our normal github
[11:20:24] <toddmparker> so have a tracker where people can ask Q's?
[11:20:47] <RWhitbeck> No I mean create issues for content that still needs attention
[11:20:59] <toddmparker> good idea
[11:21:07] <toddmparker> dunno if we want to use our tracker tho
[11:21:19] <RWhitbeck> That way we can be clear what needs to be done still
[11:21:27] <toddmparker> easy: all of it
[11:21:28] <RWhitbeck> yeah that's the thing right
[11:21:35] <RWhitbeck> haha
[11:21:38] <uGoMobi> Maybe add a section to Feature Request wiki page... demo request / Q&A request
[11:21:39] <toddmparker> but sure, i like that idea
[11:21:48] <uGoMobi> although that page is getting bit long already
[11:21:49] <toddmparker> just need a repo set up
[11:21:59] <RWhitbeck> maybe we can figure out a good plan when we corrdinate
[11:22:02] <toddmparker> be cool to have folks contribute these
[11:22:02] <arschmitz> maybe just add a wiki page for just this
[11:22:28] <RWhitbeck> maybe it fits over at jquerymobile.com
[11:22:33] <RWhitbeck> that repo
[11:22:36] <toddmparker> what we could do arschmitz is cut all these out, add 'em to a wiki page then just populate the list as we go
[11:22:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah
[11:22:54] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: that could work
[11:23:01] <toddmparker> we don't use that currently
[11:23:05] <toddmparker> so it's free
[11:23:09] <RWhitbeck> yeah
[11:23:15] <RWhitbeck> it could live there too
[11:23:27] <toddmparker> the content?
[11:23:30] <RWhitbeck> perhaps
[11:23:39] <RWhitbeck> we can talk about that later.
[11:23:46] <toddmparker> that is a question we had - should this demo stuff be int eh main repo
[11:24:03] <toddmparker> the nice thing is the demos stay in sync and can be published with releases
[11:24:19] <toddmparker> the downside is people don't see updates until we have releases
[11:24:20] <arschmitz> and people get them as part of a clone to use and play with
[11:24:25] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:24:42] <uGoMobi> and they are great for testing things on your local repo
[11:24:49] <toddmparker> so for now, let's either use the wiki or GH tracker for the site to watch content issues
[11:25:03] <toddmparker> i only used that list so I could whip up some styles
[11:25:11] <toddmparker> amazing how much better things look with a custom font
[11:25:18] <arschmitz> for sure
[11:25:21] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:25:53] <toddmparker> oh, and arschmitz said he's working on automating the "in this section" panel w/anchor links
[11:26:10] <toddmparker> so don't' populate that manually like i've been, right arschmitz
[11:26:19] <arschmitz> yup
[11:26:45] <arschmitz> once 1.3 is done so i can merge some nav changes im working on these will get added
[11:27:33] <toddmparker> yeah!
[11:28:05] <toddmparker> ok, that's it for docs. i'd like to make a big push on this in the next week or two so we can make the switch and kill the old docs
[11:28:22] <toddmparker> for 1.3, think we're in good shape.
[11:28:38] <toddmparker> now seeing anything serious open - anyone?
[11:29:26] <uGoMobi> I don't really like this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5510
[11:29:26] <b-ot> uGoMobi, issue #5510 by uGoMobi (2d 7h ago): Opening a panel while another panel is already open
[11:30:56] <toddmparker> hmmm
[11:31:09] <toddmparker> that one does seem like it's worth a look before rc
[11:31:22] <toddmparker> I bumped it to critical
[11:31:29] <uGoMobi> yes we need to fix this before next release
[11:31:30] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:31:34] <arschmitz> works great with over lay
[11:31:54] <arschmitz> push works but is not really push anymore
[11:31:55] <toddmparker> if you guys can try and get to the bottom of it
[11:32:07] <uGoMobi> I am working on it
[11:32:09] <toddmparker> anything else come in that is a showstopper from beta?
[11:32:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[11:32:17] <uGoMobi> but simple/small fixes didn't work out
[11:32:26] <toddmparker> awesome work on triage/fixes
[11:32:37] <toddmparker> you guys are killin' it
[11:33:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: this one probably merits a look too
[11:33:33] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512
[11:33:34] <b-ot> arschmitz, issue #5512 by erikyuzwa (2d 2h ago): history stack seems to be screwy on IE7 and Firefox, Chrome
[11:33:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The presence of a notification when an issue is filed helps.
[11:34:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah between irc and my email i feel like i cant miss them lol
[11:34:43] <toddmparker> dammit johnbender
[11:35:11] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: hmm
[11:35:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: is that the same issue we fixed?
[11:35:31] <arschmitz> johnbender: have not looked yet
[11:35:33] <arschmitz> could be
[11:35:44] <arschmitz> just noticed it and thought it warrented a look before rc
[11:35:49] <johnbender> for sure
[11:36:22] <arschmitz> oh also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5519
[11:36:22] <b-ot> arschmitz, issue #5519 by pupvogel (1d 22m ago): popup over selectmenu: z- or taborder related issue ?
[11:36:46] <_|Nix|_> This looks hauntingly like that fixedToolbar issue I found ...
[11:36:55] <toddmparker> that is an odd one
[11:36:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking at that right now.
[11:37:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ cool
[11:37:06] <toddmparker> is it just odd iOS behavior?
[11:37:18] <arschmitz> no they mention android being really bad at bottom
[11:37:25] <_|Nix|_> It's because of the focus restriction.
[11:37:34] <toddmparker> ah, gotcha
[11:37:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No, I can give focus to the select menu in Chrome 24 / desktop as well ...
[11:37:59] <uGoMobi> that android issue sounded very familiar
[11:38:16] <uGoMobi> pretty sure there is an open or closed ticket for that
[11:38:19] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: did you see me mention that the popups still seem to be doing that re-position thing in iOS6?
[11:39:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No. Wouldn't be surprised though - IIRC I fixed that with a debounce ... those things are inherently unstable.
[11:39:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll have another look.
[11:39:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Where did you mention it?
[11:39:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Were you checking with the old docs?
[11:39:59] <toddmparker> i'll make a quick issue _|Nix|_
[11:40:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. That's probably best.
[11:40:26] <_|Nix|_> Looks like I'm back in popup-land :)
[11:40:33] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5523
[11:40:34] <b-ot> toddmparker, issue #5523 by toddparker (5m 40s ago): Popups - re-position in iOS6
[11:40:48] <toddmparker> welcome back to popup land
[11:41:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: You can check-out any time you like,
[11:41:03] <arschmitz> But you can never leave!
[11:41:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Arrgggh! :)
[11:41:33] <_|Nix|_> Once a popup coder, always a popup coder ...
[11:41:57] <_|Nix|_> Live by the popup, die by the popup ...
[11:41:58] <_|Nix|_> etc.
[11:42:09] <toddmparker> so what else are you looking at _|Nix|_
[11:42:18] <toddmparker> (might as well go)
[11:42:22] <_|Nix|_> Well, currently these two ...
[11:42:35] <_|Nix|_> Fixed some nav issues, ...
[11:42:59] <_|Nix|_> Improved buttonMarkup performance based on Changsuk's PR.
[11:43:08] <_|Nix|_> I'll look at the rest of the PR before I close it.
[11:43:20] <_|Nix|_> He said he has another up his sleeve.
[11:43:25] <_|Nix|_> Another PR, that is.
[11:43:27] <toddmparker> ok, great. thanks for staying on that
[11:43:30] <toddmparker> good
[11:43:50] <toddmparker> there an easy way to compare before/after on a typical page?
[11:43:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did it work out with mini/inline buttons in toolbars?
[11:44:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I believe so.
[11:44:14] <uGoMobi> ok cool! thanks!
[11:44:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: changsuk was trying to find us the other night but we both missed him
[11:44:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I set up a weekly meeting Thu @ 09:00 (02:00 Easter).
[11:44:57] <toddmparker> nice
[11:44:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We meet in #web-ui-fw ...
[11:45:16] <arschmitz> ok
[11:45:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, following in jQM footsteps wherever we can ... set up a roadmap for web-ui-fw and everything.
[11:45:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, we agreed to set it up, but I haven't created the first draft yet.
[11:46:00] <toddmparker> that's really great
[11:46:29] <toddmparker> I think if you can get web-ui-fw to a point where it's easier for people to grab plugin, it will be really popular
[11:46:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: They're working on several new widgets, so adding those, plus the HSV color picker + the popup 'n arrow are slated for the first release.
[11:46:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's the plan.
[11:46:57] <toddmparker> sweet
[11:47:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I've been talking to gseguin about making it depend on individual pieces of jQM, rather than jquery.mobile.js ...
[11:47:28] <toddmparker> for fewer dependencies
[11:47:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So the libraries will work together seamlessly.
[11:48:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Theoretically, it should be possible to create a download builder that grabs exactly what you need /across/ both libraries.
[11:48:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: At least, that's the target.
[11:48:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The good news for jQM is that it helps me identify aspects of the library that could enable such integration.
[11:48:52] <toddmparker> that would be hawt
[11:48:56] <arschmitz> it would be really awesome to allow adding in other well supported things outside of jquery mobile like that
[11:49:03] <toddmparker> agreed
[11:49:38] <_|Nix|_> I think, an eventual roadmap item for us will be to go over what we have in web-ui-fw and decide whether we wanna give it a nod on the docs site.
[11:49:42] <arschmitz> the icon pack from "person whos name i cant remember" would be awesome too lol
[11:50:18] <toddmparker> Andy, yep
[11:50:23] <_|Nix|_> A pointer from jQM would really kickstart the project.
[11:50:40] <toddmparker> yeah, well you could make demos that use those widgets
[11:50:42] <_|Nix|_> But that's still a way off.
[11:50:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: once they are ready that would be great for demos
[11:50:55] <arschmitz> make a whole bunch of demos showing off their widgets
[11:50:59] <toddmparker> exactly
[11:50:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah. The structure of the demos is also identical to jQM.
[11:51:03] <toddmparker> nice
[11:51:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I factored out the view-source code so I could include it directly from web-ui-fw.
[11:51:41] <toddmparker> guys- this chrome icon bug is really annoying. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5456#issuecomment-12667223
[11:51:41] <b-ot> toddmparker, issue #5456 by salamanders (1w 1d ago): Right-button "shifts" in the "Panel: Menu + form" demo because of scrollbar
[11:51:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's an example of making jQM play nice as a subproject of another project.
[11:51:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ thats even better you could pretty much just copy and paste their demos into our directory
[11:51:47] <toddmparker> was killing me last night in the docs
[11:51:53] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[11:51:55] <arschmitz> yeah it looks terrible
[11:52:03] <toddmparker> it comes and goes
[11:52:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's the idea. Make it as easy as possible to integrate.
[11:52:08] <uGoMobi> we should file bug report
[11:52:32] <uGoMobi> and see if there is anything we can do to prevent it
[11:52:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think its something in chrome for osX i dont see it and have never seen it in windows
[11:52:40] <_|Nix|_> So yeah, I think that's about it.
[11:52:54] <toddmparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[11:53:22] <toddmparker> is this a know bug?
[11:53:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: when did you start noticing it?
[11:53:29] <toddmparker> wonder if we need to report it
[11:53:34] <uGoMobi> I couldn't find it
[11:53:37] <toddmparker> think just a few days ago
[11:53:45] <toddmparker> not 100%
[11:53:53] <uGoMobi> but not issue to search in 10000+ bug reports
[11:54:05] <uGoMobi> s/issue/easy
[11:54:08] <uGoMobi> pfff
[11:54:18] <toddmparker> heh
[11:54:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you try couple of things? hardware accel might help
[11:54:29] <toddmparker> might as well submit a bug and test page
[11:54:32] <arschmitz> ok i started when i got my mac but its on all versions of our docs not just 1.3 or anything
[11:54:43] <toddmparker> we can see if paul irish and give it a nudge
[11:54:56] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah?
[11:54:58] <uGoMobi> Chrome also has an issue with em values for top/bottom padding
[11:55:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker: good idea its really annoying
[11:55:01] <toddmparker> so it's not panels
[11:55:04] <arschmitz> no
[11:55:07] <toddmparker> ooh
[11:55:09] <uGoMobi> I reported that one
[11:55:19] <toddmparker> bug mentions panels
[11:55:22] <arschmitz> i see it on  almost all pages in all versions of docs
[11:56:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: could you test if removing the &nbsp; that we add for Android prevents the Chrome issue?
[11:56:45] <toddmparker> they fixed themselves when you mouse over
[11:56:57] <arschmitz> i checked as far back as 1.0 on http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/index.html
[11:57:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yup but scrolling messes with them for me like sets them back to bad again a lot of the time
[11:57:22] <toddmparker> h/w accel
[11:57:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[11:57:54] <arschmitz> its strange though its only on right hand one not left?
[11:58:02] <uGoMobi> is it?
[11:58:06] <arschmitz> yup
[11:58:16] <toddmparker> when i load a page, it's off
[11:58:17] <uGoMobi> he also showed a controlgroup with the issue
[11:58:20] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/
[11:58:23] <toddmparker> see the icon section
[11:58:50] <toddmparker> mouse over = fixed
[11:58:54] <toddmparker> ugh
[11:59:16] <arschmitz> yeah its some really nasty rendering
[11:59:44] <arschmitz> its seems that the further you are from the left of the page the larger the shift
[11:59:53] <paul_irish> (what was the issue you wanted to ping me about? i can take a look)
[12:00:12] <toddmparker> wow, hey paul_irish
[12:00:25] <toddmparker> look here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/#button-icons
[12:00:35] <toddmparker> scroll down to the section with icons
[12:00:51] <toddmparker> you may see that they look a bit off
[12:00:58] <toddmparker> mouse over and they shift into place
[12:01:35] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5456#issuecomment-12667223
[12:01:36] <b-ot> toddmparker, issue #5456 by salamanders (1w 1d ago): Right-button "shifts" in the "Panel: Menu + form" demo because of scrollbar
[12:01:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: have you seen it where you get an extra broken piece of one too?
[12:01:50] <arschmitz> i was noticing that on some pages
[12:02:08] <toddmparker> like stray pixels?
[12:02:12] <arschmitz> yes
[12:02:25] <toddmparker> not sure. i'll look
[12:03:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/deeplink/  does it for me
[12:03:20] <toddmparker> search icon?
[12:03:22] <arschmitz> when the scroll bar goes away after load
[12:03:24] <arschmitz> yup
[12:03:30] <toddmparker> i see it too
[12:03:47] <toddmparker> paul_irish: Version 24.0.1312.56
[12:03:48] <toddmparker> mac
[12:04:08] <toddmparker> 10.8.2
[12:04:12] <toddmparker> odd
[12:04:16] <arschmitz> exactly the same here
[12:04:39] <toddmparker> hmmm
[12:04:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and your on retina also right not that it should matter?
[12:05:13] <toddmparker> sub pixel oddness maybe
[12:05:46] <toddmparker> yeah, ok on a SD display, same setup
[12:06:00] <arschmitz> hmm so it is retina i guess?
[12:06:21] <uGoMobi> didn't see it on retina iPad
[12:06:25] <arschmitz> those are some pretty big subpixels lol
[12:06:57] <toddmparker> rounding errors
[12:07:06] <toddmparker> maybe they add it somehow
[12:07:14] <toddmparker> some icons see more off than others
[12:07:22] <arschmitz> not sure but its really annoying to look at lol
[12:07:26] <toddmparker> yep
[12:07:34] <toddmparker> explains why we don't get a ton of bugs
[12:07:58] <toddmparker> arschmitz: what else is going on?
[12:08:02] <arschmitz> yeah pretty isolated
[12:08:26] <arschmitz> been trying to stay on top of issues as they come in
[12:08:45] <arschmitz> been working hard on deeplinking to id's with help of johnbender
[12:09:00] <arschmitz> this is going to add two other features that have been requested as well
[12:09:09] <arschmitz> passing hashes to an external page
[12:09:25] <toddmparker> cool
[12:09:26] <arschmitz> and updateing the hash with out adding a history entry
[12:09:33] <toddmparker> sounds like that will be 1.4
[12:09:42] <toddmparker> great feature
[12:09:42] <arschmitz> yea i think so
[12:10:01] <arschmitz> im thinking ill have it ready to go when we push button on 1.3 final
[12:10:14] <arschmitz> so it can be in the docs by the time anyone is really looking
[12:10:58] <arschmitz> added a few demos one at the request of agcolom
[12:10:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, link to internal section is required by the docs anyway, right? Might as well have a systematic solution ...
[12:11:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats why ill have it done so right after we push 1.3 final out i can merge it in so it will be ready to go
[12:12:04] <toddmparker> nice
[12:12:06] <arschmitz> can coordinate so they are "almost" simultanious
[12:12:39] <toddmparker> since you're going to automate the jump to menu, what should we do in the templates?
[12:12:52] <toddmparker> not have the panel at all? just leave it empty?
[12:13:03] <toddmparker> should we manually put id's on the h2's?
[12:13:12] <arschmitz> we will just have to add a class on pages that need it
[12:13:26] <toddmparker> nice
[12:13:33] <toddmparker> huge timesaver
[12:13:36] <arschmitz> yup
[12:13:44] <toddmparker> for 1.3, we should just delete that markup then?
[12:13:45] <arschmitz> ill have it pull each h2 and add link to panel
[12:13:53] <arschmitz> yes i think so
[12:13:55] <toddmparker> ok
[12:13:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: May I suggest a data-* attribute instead? Like, data-autosections="true"
[12:14:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[12:14:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We shouldn't use classes for structural stuff.
[12:14:10] <toddmparker> good idea
[12:14:11] <arschmitz> more the way we do things
[12:14:33] <arschmitz> ill have it auto add the return to top link before each h2 execpt the first also
[12:15:57] <arschmitz> i also worked with ryanneufeld to get parsing of php in html
[12:16:07] <arschmitz> so we can use an include for a nav menu
[12:16:20] <arschmitz> gseguin is working on getting this into the build also
[12:16:52] <arschmitz> updated core to 1.9
[12:17:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm just wondering - isn't there a way to not have to go to the top. Like, open the panel in such a way that the list of links is pushed down to scrollTop() by a div that precedes it whose height is equal to scrollTop().
[12:17:40] <arschmitz> and continued widget review planning a bit with _|Nix|_:
[12:17:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ all depends on the page
[12:17:54] <toddmparker> cool, busy
[12:17:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you can open the panel from anywhere on the page and get the list of links.
[12:18:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi - want to go?
[12:18:08] <uGoMobi> sure
[12:18:15] <arschmitz> if its short enough for fixed position then that would work
[12:18:17] <uGoMobi> I will keep it short
[12:18:18] <arschmitz> if not it wont
[12:18:25] <uGoMobi> most things already discussed
[12:18:30] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:18:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Let's talk about it in -dev ...
[12:18:35] <toddmparker> suggest not to support opening multiple panels programmatically
[12:18:41] <toddmparker> +1 if that is messy
[12:18:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:18:52] <toddmparker> can always add it later
[12:18:53] <uGoMobi> I agree
[12:18:53] <arschmitz> only thing with that is it works great for overlay
[12:18:56] <toddmparker> just need to update the docs
[12:19:09] <uGoMobi> we don't have the CSS to open panel left and right at same time
[12:19:14] <toddmparker> we can say that I suppose
[12:19:16] <arschmitz> i use it in overlay and link from one to another in something and its perfect reveal is the issue
[12:19:21] <uGoMobi> yes, will remove that
[12:19:56] <toddmparker> i can see how that could get ugly
[12:20:23] <toddmparker> looking forward to the grid demo
[12:20:42] <uGoMobi_> sorry... IRCCloud
[12:20:57] <uGoMobi_> :(
[12:21:14] <uGoMobi_> working on the listview grid demo now
[12:21:26] <uGoMobi_> don't think Keith has time to finish it
[12:21:31] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:21:47] <uGoMobi_> and that panel chaining issue
[12:21:58] <uGoMobi_> that's about it
[12:22:07] <uGoMobi_> next week docs & demossss
[12:22:09] <uGoMobi_> :)
[12:25:35] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: do you want me to debug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514
[12:25:35] <b-ot> uGoMobi_, issue #5514 by benwwest (1d 10h ago): Fixed footer moves when select opened
[12:26:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you want i had a couple ideas i could try but i honestly dont think any will work
[12:26:33] <arschmitz> i dont know how to capture a menu close with out it firing some sort of event
[12:26:36] <uGoMobi_> I can use Chrome code inspector to debug my android device and see what events are fired
[12:26:47] <uGoMobi_> if any
[12:27:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah id go for it i dont have great access to the 4.1 device here as it actually belongs to some one lol
[12:27:25] <uGoMobi_> ok sure np
[12:27:39] <arschmitz> i have a terrible feeling there is no event though :(
[12:28:19] <toddmparker> probably right...
[12:28:46] <toddmparker> alright, think we can break up this party. keep cranking, good week so far.
[12:29:05] <arschmitz> sounds good
