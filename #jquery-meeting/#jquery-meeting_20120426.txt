[11:02:13] <gnarf> sigh - hangouts
[11:02:14] <gnarf> :)
[11:04:29] <gseguin> You're welcome to join gnarf, we use to do it public but ended up with a bunch of randos
[11:04:48] <gseguin> Hopefully Google will open their "on air" to a wider audience soon
[11:05:39] <gnarf> :)
[11:07:11] <gnarf> hangouts hurts my computer so much :)
[11:11:19] <toddparker> ok, new team members - added as committers - Anne and Gabriel
[11:11:24] <toddparker> congrats guys
[11:12:42] <toddparker> Bender is working on grunt
[11:16:42] <gnarf> do you guys have an agenda link for your meeting btw?
[11:24:04] <gseguin> gnarf: no agenda today, mostly status
[11:24:36] <gnarf> I was just gonna edit it into the title if there was a consistent google doc or something
[11:28:00] <gnarf> what do you guys need from infra with regards to your builds? can whomever needs whatever talk with me about it? :)
[11:28:10] <gnarf> (sorry, I can't use the voice atm, sitting in a bullpen)
[11:30:26] <gseguin> gnarf I'll ping you on -dev in the afternoon
[11:30:33] <toddparker> download builder in good shape, adding alpha testers
[11:30:38] <toddparker> just testing and fixing bugs
[11:30:48] <toddparker> we'll do a public beta next
[11:31:05] <toddparker> popup - working on the history/hash management
[11:31:27] <toddparker> Gabriel working on this now
[11:31:49] <toddparker> investigating stacking popup support
[11:32:13] <toddparker> in "popup-widget" branch
[11:56:57] <toddparker> looking into changes in the widget factory to support dynamic changes
[12:10:40] <rworth> scott_gonzalez _|Nix|_ has a proposal for changing _setOption in the widget factory to look for _setOptionName methods on this in place of switch case
[12:10:51] <rworth> I suggested he ash you and jzaefferer in #jqueryui-dev
[12:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> rworth, _|Nix|_: I'll land a PR for that.
[12:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> I already have a TODO for it :-)
[12:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> Of course we'll need a ticket for it first.
[12:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the related TODO https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.button.js#L207
