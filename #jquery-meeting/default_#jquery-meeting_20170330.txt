[14:15:17] <arschmitz> once we can just confirm that ill tag to put it live
[14:15:31] <arschmitz> and publish the blog post and tweet
[14:21:59] <apsdehal> hi
[14:22:04] <apsdehal> Got late
[14:22:12] <apsdehal> Was sitting there then something came up
[14:22:54] <apsdehal> arschmitz: is the pr looking fine now?
[14:23:13] <arschmitz> apsdehal: its merged
[14:23:23] <arschmitz> you can see it at http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/
[14:25:04] <apsdehal> awesome
[14:25:11] <apsdehal> widgets are still showing 1.4 data
[14:25:15] <apsdehal> how will that change
[14:26:42] <arschmitz> what do you mean im looking at button and it has all the deprecations and everything
[14:27:08] <arschmitz> there are some issues in general i see but it is showing 1.5
[14:28:54] <apsdehal> Yeah, there are some issues, I was seeing: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/category/widgets/
[14:29:44] <arschmitz> whats wrong with that page?
[14:30:05] <arschmitz> aside from that its missing accordion
[14:30:45] <cgack> arschmitz: what should that page look like
[14:31:06] <apsdehal> See the note
[14:31:12] <arschmitz> it looks like it should other then missing accordion widget not sure
[14:31:31] <cgack> mine looks like http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/widgets/
[14:31:33] <arschmitz> apsdehal: whats wrong with the note thats still relevant
[14:31:58] <arschmitz> yeah i think the only change should be adding accordion its missing
[14:32:19] <apsdehal> >  The base widget ($.mobile.widget) is deprecated as of 1.4 and will be removed in 1.5. I
[14:32:25] <apsdehal> will be removed in 1.5
[14:32:29] <apsdehal> This is 1.5
[14:35:51] <arschmitz> yes
[14:36:02] <arschmitz> so its still relevant to say it was removed in this version
[14:36:29] <arschmitz> maybe change will to was
[14:38:55] <cgack> okay yeah, that was confusing to me with the way it was worded, but I get it now
[14:50:36] <apsdehal> That was the first thing I saw
[14:50:42] <apsdehal> So I thought it was 1.4
[14:52:01] <apsdehal> arschmitz: What else do you need me to do, except finding and fixes issues with 1.5?
[14:52:10] <apsdehal> *fixing
[14:52:28] <arschmitz> all i care about for the moment is fixing anything related to 1.5
[14:52:33] <arschmitz> both in docs and the lib
[14:53:01] <apsdehal> Once it is released, I think we will get to know about more issues
[14:53:36] <arschmitz> yeah but im sure you can find plenty just in the docs too
[14:53:41] <arschmitz> that are really simple fixes
[14:54:44] <apsdehal> Ok, I will open up a separate PR for fixes alone
