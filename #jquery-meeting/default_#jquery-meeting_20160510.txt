[14:02:59] <sfrisk> nashvail, kristyjy, arschmitz, geekman-rohit
[14:03:09] <arschmitz> hi
[14:03:10] <sfrisk> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:03:30] <sfrisk> Sooo, I'm kinda in the middle of a major architecture meeting for work of some emergency work
[14:03:44] <sfrisk> so I have the agenda ready to go - but I should be participating in this meeting
[14:04:27] <sfrisk> if someone could run this meeting and just update the agenda notes, that would be helpful
[14:04:40] <arschmitz> so far aside from you its just me
[14:04:45] <arschmitz> so might be a boring meeting talking to my self
[14:05:25] <kristy> well I am here but not too much to say from my end. I did get some table stuff done
[14:05:28] <nashvail> Hello
[14:05:55] <arschmitz> PEOPLE!
[14:06:06] <nashvail> I have some initial UI guide ready
[14:06:47] <sfrisk> oo, yay
[14:06:48] <sfrisk> link?
[14:07:18] <kristy> Also added a PR last night to add a note about running grunt test. I always forget to do it so I thought that might help me and others :)
[14:07:25] <nashvail> It's a sketch file I have started working on the Buttons
[14:07:26] <kristy> to the README I mean
[14:07:36] <nashvail> I opened this issue https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/157
[14:08:02] <nashvail> if anyone could check it out if it's formatted properly
[14:08:45] <sfrisk> I think there is an extra large button?
[14:08:51] <sfrisk> 5 button sizes currently
[14:09:22] <nashvail> I will update it with Extra large
[14:09:36] <nashvail> I'll need help with the table styling, not sure what to put there,
[14:09:51] <nashvail> Also I played around with button styles would you like to have a look at the mockup ?
[14:11:26] <sfrisk> kristyjy did update some table stuff this weekend
[14:11:34] <sfrisk> so it works with the new jsass stuff
[14:11:40] <sfrisk> sure
[14:11:42] <sfrisk> send me a link
[14:11:55] <kristy> yup and has classes instead of elements now too
[14:11:57] <kristy> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/151
[14:12:33] <geekman-rohit> Hey everyone
[14:12:34] <geekman-rohit> Sorry
[14:12:38] <geekman-rohit> Got distracted
[14:12:45] <kristy> I added a sample table with all divs so you can see they work the same
[14:13:10] <nashvail> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/vU38k6gu/Screen%20Shot%202016-05-10%20at%2011.39.56%20PM.png
[14:13:23] <nashvail> Like you mentioned we are inclining a little towards material design
[14:13:37] <geekman-rohit> Material design is the current trend
[14:13:51] <geekman-rohit> I like it because it is very accessibility oriented
[14:14:08] <geekman-rohit> So that's not a bad thing
[14:14:29] <nashvail> yes, agreed
[14:14:52] <nashvail> The font is Open Sans
[14:15:11] <sfrisk> I like
[14:15:51] <geekman-rohit> @sfrisk it's a personal opinion :p
[14:17:03] <geekman-rohit_> @nashvail can u resend the last link
[14:17:23] <nashvail> the image?  it's here https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/vU38k6gu/Screen%20Shot%202016-05-10%20at%2011.39.56%20PM.png
[14:17:41] <geekman-rohit_> ah thanks
[14:18:49] <sfrisk> I assume top row is disabled
[14:18:54] <sfrisk> second row is "default"
[14:19:00] <sfrisk> 3rd is active? or focused?
[14:19:04] <nashvail> Yes Disabled, Normal, Hover
[14:19:27] <sfrisk> okay, we'll need to figure out active
[14:19:30] <nashvail> I guess in focus we'll have a blue glowing outline of sort
[14:19:37] <nashvail> s
[14:19:52] <nashvail> Along with the shadow?
[14:20:11] <sfrisk> and have some sort of outline
[14:20:17] <geekman-rohit_> @nashvail do the button follow material design?
[14:20:29] <geekman-rohit_> buttons*
[14:20:30] <sfrisk> they're close to a lot of aspects of material design
[14:20:59] <geekman-rohit_> http://view.css-chassis.com/master/demos/buttons.html
[14:21:10] <geekman-rohit_> our current buttons are closer, principally
[14:21:37] <geekman-rohit_> nashvails colors look, more pleasant
[14:21:52] <nashvail> We don't have to strictly stick with Material design right?
[14:22:10] <geekman-rohit_> nope not at all
[14:22:14] <geekman-rohit_> we only use what we like
[14:22:40] <nashvail> Yes, we can just pick the good parts I suppose
[14:22:53] <nashvail> or the parts we like I mean
[14:23:36] <sfrisk> no we don't, it was more just an idea we started with
[14:23:56] <sfrisk> I like your colors, should double check contrasting
[14:24:13] <geekman-rohit_> what sfrik said
[14:24:19] <geekman-rohit_> sfrisk*
[14:24:27] <geekman-rohit_> about contrasting
[14:24:48] <nashvail> Also I think buttons are like brand icons for frameworks like you can look at Bootstrap's button and quickly identify it's bootstrap's and similar for Foundation so I think the buttons should have a unique style
[14:24:51] <geekman-rohit_> unknowingly most of our own principals are part of material desing
[14:24:58] <geekman-rohit_> there is bound to be similarity
[14:25:17] <geekman-rohit_> high contrast colors, user exp oriented, bold , accessibility first
[14:25:23] <sfrisk> definitely it would help to have a unique style - but also make it super easy to customize so customization isn't quite the main it is for stuff like bootstrap
[14:25:53] <geekman-rohit_> bootstraps buttons are easily customizable
[14:26:08] <sfrisk> more from a css perspective, not class switching out
[14:26:23] <geekman-rohit_> also we need to consider content editable divisions in input styling
[14:26:27] <geekman-rohit_> not apply by default
[14:26:38] <geekman-rohit_> but our styling for from fields should be easy to assign to divisions
[14:26:42] <geekman-rohit_> using classes
[14:26:57] <geekman-rohit_> for form88
[14:27:03] <geekman-rohit_> FOR FORM***
[14:27:10] <geekman-rohit_> damn you keyboard
[14:27:48] <geekman-rohit_> @sfrisk agreed
[14:28:38] <nashvail> speaking of inputs "Focused" and "Typing" state are the same right?
[14:28:45] <sfrisk> yes
[14:30:28] <nashvail> Alright updated the issue description, I had "Focus" and "Typing" now it's just "Focus"
[14:32:38] <sfrisk> :active, :hover, :focus, :disabled
[14:32:57] <nashvail> Error?
[14:33:05] <sfrisk> error would be a class
[14:33:11] <sfrisk> not a css state
[14:33:22] <sfrisk> but we should have an error class
[14:35:48] <geekman-rohit_> yes
[14:36:44] <nashvail> okay, sfrisk could you go through the issue once in your free time I think I might have made some mistakes
[14:37:45] <sfrisk> yeah sure
[14:37:46] <sfrisk> can do
[14:37:51] <sfrisk> sorry, this has been a crazy day at work
[14:38:04] <geekman-rohit_> umm block buttons?
[14:38:17] <geekman-rohit_> they come in handy at times
[14:38:52] <nashvail> Yus! Block buttons
[14:40:35] <sfrisk> block buttons and button bars
[14:41:23] <nashvail> I'll take a note. Please add it in the issue if something is missing ðŸ˜ƒ
[14:43:47] <sfrisk> okay, I'll update the issue with my notes
[14:43:55] <nashvail> thanks!
[14:43:57] <sfrisk> also please review the copy update to the readme regarding running tests
[14:44:40] <sfrisk> and also the div/class solution for tables in the tables PR
[14:44:50] <sfrisk> now I must run away back to work
[14:45:01] <sfrisk> see everyone later this week
[14:45:48] <nashvail> Bye!
[14:45:52] <nashvail> I
[14:45:57] <nashvail> I'll keep working on the guide
