[09:01:01] <timmywil> markelog_____, m_gol, DaveMethvin, arthurvr, gibson042 Meeting time!
[09:01:12] <DaveMethvin> oh meeting time!
[09:01:22] <DaveMethvin> my favorite time of the year
[09:01:30] <timmywil> So, most importantly, what does everyone think of Kanye and Kim
[09:01:36] <DaveMethvin> m_gol is on vacation
[09:01:41] <DaveMethvin> prob with Kayne and Kim
[09:01:54] <timmywil> right, as you were m_gol
[09:01:58] <DaveMethvin> imma let you finish but jQuery 1.4.2 was the best ever
[09:02:21] <timmywil> I don't think Kanye and Kim helped with that
[09:02:46] <timmywil> anyone else here?
[09:03:00] <timmywil> you don't have to discuss entermainment news with me
[09:03:01] <DaveMethvin> it's lonely at the top
[09:03:11] <DaveMethvin> i have a couple of things while we're here
[09:03:16] <timmywil> sure
[09:03:35] <DaveMethvin> i created this page https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Adding-new-features
[09:03:48] <DaveMethvin> i suspect we'll only reference it after the fact, like that ticket today
[09:03:58] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:03:59] <timmywil> woops! sorry for the mute everyone
[09:04:07] <timmywil> thanks gibson042
[09:04:27] <gibson042> it's nice to be back out of the cone of silence
[09:04:34] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 should be an op and then we could just talk amongst us ops
[09:04:43] <timmywil> but leave on that dunce hat, it looks good
[09:04:51] <DaveMethvin> coneheads
[09:05:01] <gibson042> <:-)
[09:05:01] * timmywil likes this idea
[09:05:19] <DaveMethvin> i wonder, should the wontfix page be on the wiki too?
[09:05:27] <DaveMethvin> might be easier to maintain
[09:05:29] <timmywil> Thank you btw, DaveMethvin. That's a good list of reasons to shut people up I think
[09:05:40] <arthurvr> the date in the agenda doc is wrong right?
[09:05:48] <DaveMethvin> you misunderestimate the power needed to shut people up i think
[09:05:50] <timmywil> Look to the future arthurvr
[09:05:58] <arthurvr> timmywil: :-)
[09:06:25] <timmywil> you made up misunderestimate
[09:06:32] <DaveMethvin> so? :)
[09:06:39] <gibson042> how do we feel about wiki vs. in-repository? GitHub wikis feel so dark and unreachable
[09:06:54] <gibson042> and unindexed also, from what I can tell
[09:07:01] <DaveMethvin> it's a question of where we want to put things that nobody reads anyway :)
[09:07:12] <DaveMethvin> i can move that to a jquery.com page if it makes more sense there
[09:07:35] <timmywil> I think the wiki is nice for little things that not a lot of people care to read.
[09:07:40] <markelog_____> what is the easier way?
[09:07:50] <arthurvr> wiki IMHO
[09:07:56] <timmywil> well, wiki is easiest
[09:08:00] <markelog_____> it feels that jquery.com update is harder to do
[09:08:06] <markelog_____> with vargant and all that
[09:08:13] <DaveMethvin> now that the gh online editor is decent it's not hard to maintain in a repo, but tagging to get it pushed is a pain
[09:08:31] <DaveMethvin> so that's why i went with wiki
[09:08:44] <DaveMethvin> we could reference some of those pages in the README if it made sense
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> or CONTRIBUTING
[09:09:13] <timmywil> It's really just there for linking to people
[09:09:24] <timmywil> but I'm fine with adding references
[09:09:31] <DaveMethvin> i just wish GH would do a better job of the initial issue reporting page
[09:09:39] <DaveMethvin> that's where things go wrong
[09:10:05] <timmywil> It should have entertainment news
[09:10:23] <gibson042> we can link _that_ in README.md
[09:10:27] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: do you want me to take the Migrate tickets?
[09:10:37] <DaveMethvin> i think they should be easy
[09:10:44] <DaveMethvin> so that's why i'm taking them :)
[09:10:55] <timmywil> Well, that would be super
[09:11:03] <timmywil> what about Deferred
[09:11:08] * timmywil dumdumdum
[09:11:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll leave the hard stuff to gibson042  :)
[09:11:36] <gibson042> I haven't heard anything about it since last week
[09:12:01] <timmywil> No, I mean, do we want to support legacy behavior for deferreds in migrate?
[09:12:30] <timmywil> Maybe add a default error handler?
[09:12:44] <timmywil> Just a thought
[09:13:32] <gibson042> hmmm
[09:14:02] <DaveMethvin> definitely need the error handler, but it can be stupid simple ... i proposed one in the comments that would only yell for syntax errors and the like
[09:14:14] <gibson042> I think that conversation should be.... deferred 8-)
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> DEFERREDCEPTION
[09:14:43] <timmywil> ok, we can defer that, but thank you DaveMethvin for staying on top of migrate
[09:15:26] <timmywil> We can also take our time with the Velocity discussion, but I would like to see where you guys are leaning.
[09:16:17] <gibson042> especially in a domain like animations where jQuery will never be enough for everybody, I think the most important thing we can do is promote a consistent interface
[09:16:31] <markelog_____> i have the same position i had before
[09:16:48] <DaveMethvin> i think the telling thing will be how well it passes current unit tests
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> it should be possible to find that out without too much investment of time on julian's part
[09:17:25] <timmywil> I'm just concerned about wasting Julian's time. Except, personally, I don't think the attempt to integrate is a waste of time.
[09:17:53] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ok, that's my hope
[09:17:54] <markelog_____> yeah
[09:18:21] <markelog_____> attempt might be good, but i think we should lower our expectations
[09:18:26] <DaveMethvin> if it's really going to break a lot of stuff, it seems better for people to build their own jquery without our animate and include Velocity or Greensock
[09:18:46] <markelog_____> currently it does break everything
[09:18:56] <markelog_____> like 400 tests from 500
[09:19:04] * gibson042 whistles
[09:19:10] <DaveMethvin> well that's not *everything* :)))
[09:19:25] <markelog_____> okay-okay, you got me, almost everything )
[09:19:27] <timmywil> yea, that's like 500-400 tests passing!
[09:19:27] <DaveMethvin> it passes the ".animate() method exists" test :)
[09:19:41] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I don't think we test for that
[09:19:48] <DaveMethvin> well we should!
[09:19:52] <markelog_____> aam, it wouldn't actually )
[09:19:54] * timmywil cheers
[09:20:03] <markelog_____> velocity has $.fn.velocity
[09:21:18] <timmywil> OK, well, maybe I should make it clear to Julian that he shouldn't start gutting Velocity
[09:21:38] <markelog_____> btw, don't remember exact number of falling tests, so don't quote me on that )
[09:21:51] <DaveMethvin> i suspect many/most have the same root cause
[09:22:00] <DaveMethvin> so it would be interesting to see what it is
[09:22:13] <timmywil> true
[09:22:17] <markelog_____> some them, and some of them really aren't
[09:22:25] <DaveMethvin> but yeah, if it looks too hard i wouldn't want to have him do a lot of work
[09:22:31] <markelog_____> like end states, step method, etc
[09:22:52] <timmywil> Sounds good
[09:22:52] <DaveMethvin> let's face it, unit tests are generally made up of edge cases so it's not surprising
[09:23:00] <timmywil> show/hide https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2057
[09:23:16] <markelog_____> some of them, and some of them, really aren't ))
[09:23:31] <markelog_____> we can try to use hidden
[09:23:31] <markelog_____> sure
[09:23:39] <markelog_____> but it is not support in ie10
[09:23:41] <timmywil> We talked about using the [hidden] attribute a while back, but I wonder if it's more feasible now.
[09:23:45] <markelog_____> so two code paths
[09:23:53] <DaveMethvin> simplifying show/hide would be so awesome, is it realistic?
[09:23:55] <markelog_____> or just display stuff
[09:23:56] <timmywil> or adding CSS to the page?
[09:23:56] <DaveMethvin> i hope so
[09:24:09] <gibson042> please no global CSS from jQuery
[09:24:12] <timmywil> I hope so too
[09:24:16] <gibson042> rather https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1767
[09:24:17] <markelog_____> gibson042: ++1
[09:24:36] <gibson042> specifically https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1767#issuecomment-59862309
[09:25:12] <markelog_____> defaultDisplay is really rare problem, it only a concern for the byte size i think
[09:25:16] <gibson042> just toggle elem.style.display between "hidden" and whatever was there before
[09:25:33] <timmywil> the bottleneck in Paul's ticket had to do with webkit taking forever to retrieve the display value. Could we get around reading it?
[09:25:45] <gibson042> it's not so much about defaultDisplay as it is overriding display: none in stylesheet
[09:25:55] <gibson042> timmywil: yes, by looking _only_ at elem.style
[09:25:59] <DaveMethvin> which is a really common case
[09:26:02] <gibson042> not getComputedStyle
[09:26:06] <markelog_____> right
[09:26:09] <timmywil> gibson042: hooray!
[09:26:18] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: is it?
[09:26:19] <markelog_____> well, let's look at it closesly
[09:26:27] <gibson042> it seems so backwards
[09:26:29] <markelog_____> need to understand what use-cases we're no longer support
[09:26:29] <DaveMethvin> well i know I've done it myself
[09:26:36] <DaveMethvin> so i declare it to be common :)
[09:26:40] <gibson042> lol
[09:27:16] <DaveMethvin> the stylesheet-hidden case is the only sticky one since you don't know the "correct" display
[09:27:50] <timmywil> I know defaultDisplay is big, but it doesn't seem like a performance issue. It's just about whether it is worth it's size.
[09:27:59] <markelog_____> yep
[09:28:17] <markelog_____> we can use hidden attribute and slow down for ie
[09:28:31] <gibson042> oh, I'm not arguing in favor of getting rid of defaultDisplay for its own sake
[09:28:31] <markelog_____> this seems doable
[09:28:56] <gibson042> I'm claiming it will just naturally go away from more sane .show()/.hide() behavior
[09:29:13] <timmywil> gibson042: gotcha
[09:29:41] <timmywil> so I see 3 options. 1. only reading elem.style.display 2. using the hidden attribute where available 3. both
[09:29:42] <DaveMethvin> so is this a 3.0 feature, or a 4.0 one?
[09:29:59] <markelog_____> i like #3
[09:30:08] <markelog_____> but again, need to check out the implementation
[09:30:21] <markelog_____> a lot of tests will break )
[09:30:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: good q
[09:30:43] <gibson042> I'm pushing for 3.0
[09:30:46] <markelog_____> i'd say, its easy to do
[09:30:50] <markelog_____> so i'm for 3.0
[09:30:51] <timmywil> Is anyone will to take this on for 3.0?
[09:30:58] <timmywil> willing*
[09:30:59] <gibson042> I've already got the first part
[09:31:28] <markelog_____> i can too, when i finish with other tickets )
[09:31:38] <timmywil> markelog_____: would you like to investigate the hidden attribute feasibility?
[09:31:44] <markelog_____> yep
[09:31:46] <gibson042> does someone want to perf-test elem.style.display vs. elem.hidden?
[09:32:06] <markelog_____> seems easy
[09:32:16] <markelog_____> but might be different in the jq code
[09:32:24] <markelog_____> so i would compare old with new code
[09:32:25] <markelog_____> too
[09:32:38] <gibson042> I guess that means waiting for new code, then ;)
[09:33:35] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1835 tbody
[09:33:39] <markelog_____> so...? Who is gonna do it?
[09:33:59] <markelog_____> i can, but i'm not sure if gibson042 is mind, since you started to work on it?
[09:33:59] <gibson042> me for an elem.style PR (gh-1767), and then we'll see
[09:34:09] <timmywil> The perf test? We can throw that together when we've got some code.
[09:34:20] <gibson042> unless you're free immediately, in which case I will yield the ticket
[09:34:47] <markelog_____> all right, so gh-1767, then we will see, corret?
[09:34:49] <markelog_____> *correct
[09:34:53] <gibson042> +1
[09:34:56] <timmywil> sounds good
[09:34:58] <markelog_____> okay, seems good
[09:35:00] <markelog_____> tbody
[09:35:06] <markelog_____> need to finish up with comments and merge it
[09:35:18] <markelog_____> can do it, after the meeting
[09:35:21] <timmywil> This ticket is marked for review, but it seems like we've resolved it correct?
[09:35:27] <markelog_____> yep
[09:35:30] <timmywil> ok cool
[09:35:39] <timmywil> thanks markelog_____
[09:35:44] <markelog_____> i was very detailed
[09:35:52] <markelog_____> so all info is there
[09:36:14] <markelog_____> Dave check it out too
[09:36:25] <markelog_____> and gibson042
[09:37:24] <timmywil> And we've handed off the migrate issues to DaveMethvin –sucker – so all that's left is to set a date for 3.0 beta. But maybe we don't need to set a date, depending on Dave's answer to this: do you think Ben Affleck will be a good batman?
[09:37:43] <DaveMethvin> wait, i am not answering hard questions today
[09:37:47] <timmywil> wait, not that question
[09:37:56] <timmywil> did you have a date in mind already
[09:38:00] <timmywil> or rough estimate
[09:38:12] <DaveMethvin> me? no, it was mainly waiting on major changes
[09:38:20] <DaveMethvin> the hidden one just got added :)
[09:38:38] <DaveMethvin> once those are done there can be a beta
[09:39:00] <timmywil> yep, so if there was no pressure to release quickly, I'd say we shouldn't set a date until we've got the major issues resolved.
[09:39:11] <DaveMethvin> depending on the amount of yelling and gun-waving you can decide on how much to back out :)
[09:39:12] <markelog_____> as far as recall, we have most problems with deferred and data
[09:39:38] <markelog_____> so if we resolve them, we can understand when to release
[09:39:39] <markelog_____> i think
[09:39:42] <timmywil> yep, just need to merge those I believe
[09:39:53] <DaveMethvin> i'd merge asap and we can tweak
[09:39:57] <markelog_____> then it should be easy :-)
[09:40:06] <gibson042> data doesn't even have a PR yet
[09:40:51] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2070 ?
[09:41:20] <DaveMethvin> i thought for sure we had a pr for that
[09:41:33] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2036
[09:41:33] <gibson042> there's no PR for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1751#issuecomment-67721150
[09:41:41] <gibson042> "Embrace HTML5"
[09:41:57] <timmywil> Oh right, I took that
[09:42:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah 2036 is only part of that
[09:42:49] <timmywil> Ok, so I'll work on that this week
[09:42:50] <gibson042> my 3.0 blockers list would look like 1) Deferred; 2) Data; 3) show/hide; 4) domManip interception (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1747 )
[09:43:23] <DaveMethvin> geez it's like the gibson042 memorial edition
[09:43:32] <gibson042> sadly
[09:43:44] <gibson042> but the last two are tiny
[09:44:17] <markelog_____> devil in the details
[09:44:32] <DaveMethvin> i'll focus on Migrate and also do the docs changes so if you have any of those just pull me in and be sure to tag anything behavior-change as needed
[09:44:40] <markelog_____> like #4 might be tricky
[09:45:16] <gibson042> ooh, maybe also https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1724
[09:45:53] <timmywil> Yea, that's a slight behavior change, although we haven't always been consistent in that area
[09:46:11] <DaveMethvin> that means switching to gBCR, pros and cons to that
[09:46:26] <DaveMethvin> the docs already say they can be fractional
[09:46:43] <markelog_____> but not in ie, right?
[09:46:43] <DaveMethvin> since we subtract out borders and such in some cases and they can be fractional
[09:47:00] <DaveMethvin> old ie, i don't think they ever are
[09:47:35] <DaveMethvin> it's mainly a question of how much breakage you want in 3.0 and how soon 4.0 might arrive to allow more breakage
[09:48:08] <DaveMethvin> and who knows what it will break, that's always been a problem because we don't know what plugins are depending on what
[09:48:14] <DaveMethvin> it might break very little
[09:48:40] <DaveMethvin> so if we could get people to try a beta with existing popular plugins that would be awesome
[09:49:09] <gibson042> can we identify that set?
[09:49:29] <gibson042> esprima includes downstream software in unit testing
[09:49:37] <gibson042> for precisely that reason
[09:49:59] <markelog_____> ui has that right?
[09:50:02] <markelog_____> integration tests?
[09:50:09] <gibson042> I'm not sure
[09:50:10] <markelog_____> with the core
[09:50:18] <gibson042> core is upstream from ui
[09:50:22] <markelog_____> we can do the same for popular plugins
[09:50:49] <gibson042> right, if we can identify popular plugins
[09:50:56] <DaveMethvin> if we don't break *something* in UI we aren't tying hard enough
[09:50:56] <markelog_____> stars on github
[09:51:20] <markelog_____> not sure if it should be in core repo or in migrate
[09:51:31] <markelog_____> maybe even in both
[09:51:39] <gibson042> both
[09:52:07] <markelog_____> what we gonna do if we would break some plugin?
[09:52:24] <gibson042> make an informed decision for a change ;)
[09:52:24] <markelog_____> nvm, need to create a ticket and discuss it there
[09:52:48] <markelog_____> we can deal with details in there
[09:53:04] <timmywil> yup, let's continue in -dev and on github
[09:53:12] <markelog_____> right on )
[09:53:13] <timmywil> I think that's all. Thanks everyone!
[09:53:34] <timmywil> Turning on cone of silence again
