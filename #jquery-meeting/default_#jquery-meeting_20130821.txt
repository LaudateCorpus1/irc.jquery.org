[09:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything to discuss this week?
[09:01:46] <fnagel> Nope
[09:01:46] <kborchers> tuesday meeting pushed to wednesday again so mostly  just lurking again today
[09:02:16] <tj_vantoll> Hey. I wanted to chat about datepicker quickly.
[09:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: sure
[09:02:59] <tj_vantoll> We chatted about this before but are we ok ditching history on the current branch and starting with a new one?
[09:03:38] <tj_vantoll> Because the current one was based on popup at some point and is a bit of a mess.
[09:03:42] <rxaviers> hello
[09:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we can kill the history.
[09:04:24] <tj_vantoll> Alright I'll start up a new branch then.
[09:05:10] <tj_vantoll> Other than that I have multi month datepickers working so the next step is to start working on the final API.
[09:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:05:41] <rxaviers> From my side, I started working on globalize:CLDR, but nothing yet. There's a new comment on the issue that gives some help. I will reply to that soon.
[09:06:17] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: when you think your at a good place id like to start testing integrating this into mobile datepicker is very high priority for us
[09:07:25] <rxaviers> Just remembering, whenever you (scott_gonzalez) have a chance to review the UMD thing, just let me know. Depending on how the "dependencies" thread goes, what do you thing of decoupling colors in this UMD branch/pull?
[09:07:41] <rxaviers> I could work on that if you will
[09:07:53] <fnagel> Do we plan to integrate an option to pick time, too?
[09:07:54] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: Ok. What's there is relatively stable, just need to go through the crazy number of options in the current plugin and decide what to do with them. I'll let you know.
[09:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Not as part of that branch.
[09:08:05] <rxaviers> ok
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: no
[09:09:01] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah thats why i said when ever you thought you were at a good place for it let me know :) i figured you would know best when it was ready for that sort of thing
[09:10:25] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: Will do.
[09:11:46] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: awesome thanks i can do a pretty substantial round of mobile testing if / when you need it too
[09:12:18] <arschmitz> as far as device testing i mean
[09:12:31] <tj_vantoll> Cool.
[09:14:02] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah just ping me anytime you need anything tested on a mobile device i have just about anything you could be looking for
[09:16:29] <tj_vantoll> Excellent. I'll have a good chunk of time to work on datepicker next week and hope to make a good dent in it.
[09:18:37] <tj_vantoll> That's all I have.
