[09:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz fnagel jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers
[09:01:13] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:13] <b-ot> rxaviers: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:01:20] <rxaviers> `read
[09:01:20] <b-ot> rxaviers: From m_gol, 1d 7h ago: look at build/tasks/build.js near "figure out which files to exclude"; it's build:*:+ajax, not build:*:*+ajax etc.
[09:01:24] <fnagel> hey
[09:01:40] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a pretty short agenda today.
[09:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to be blocking stuff right now :-/
[09:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> I need to review button.
[09:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> And I need to send a PR for the form reset mixin.
[09:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz, jzaefferer, and I discussed the various implementation options the other day.
[09:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> And we decided to go with a mixin.
[09:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> And not to add any new API surface to $.widget().
[09:03:18] <arschmitz> we are going to accept an array i thought?
[09:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, umm...yeah, I'm looking at my notes now and I'm remembering this wrong.
[09:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to add support for mixins into $.widget().
[09:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so the API will allow an array of objects for the prototype.
[09:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> So you can do: $.widget( "ui.selectmenu", [ $.ui.formResetMixin, { ...normal prototype here... } ] );
[09:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> And I never got together with arschmitz to work on selectmenu height.
[09:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> Man, I'm just full of fail this week.
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be doing the form reset stuff this afternoon.
[09:06:38] <arschmitz> awesome
[09:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> There was a ticket that came in that I'd like to discuss.
[09:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12588
[09:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's currently pending. I'm trying to figure out why this is needed.
[09:09:54] <arschmitz> oh i do
[09:10:03] <arschmitz> the fact that we are failing massivly on git
[09:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yeah
[09:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> Core broke half of our test sutie.
[09:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> *suite
[09:10:53] <arschmitz> so i got to the bottom of this with DaveMethvin
[09:11:10] <arschmitz> its 2 different breakages both from the same commit
[09:11:25] <arschmitz> one i think is only breaking tests for interactions but the interactions are ok
[09:11:41] <arschmitz> offset does not work on disconnected or hidden elements any more
[09:11:57] <arschmitz> the second is not breaking the tests
[09:12:06] <arschmitz> but is breaking most things that use position
[09:12:32] <arschmitz> anything that does not pass a within to position
[09:12:52] <arschmitz> so that position uses window is broken because core no longer returns undefined on $( window ).offset()
[09:13:07] <arschmitz> instead it lets it throw getBoundingRect is not a function
[09:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that's an easy fix.
[09:14:18] <arschmitz> yes
[09:14:34] <arschmitz> im filing an issue with core though
[09:14:40] <arschmitz> because this will break all old ui versions
[09:15:16] <arschmitz> but i think we should fix it on our side anyway because calling offset on window does not seem valid
[09:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> Did you want to do that?
[09:16:22] <arschmitz> sure
[09:16:36] <arschmitz> so related to this in that its how i noticed all the broken tests
[09:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably just a one line change.
[09:16:50] <arschmitz> 2 lines but thats just because of how we do it
[09:17:16] <arthurvr> hey-hey everybody. A little late but Iâ€™m here.
[09:17:24] <arschmitz> i was going to submit a pr today for removing our dependency on the event alias module in core
[09:17:55] <arschmitz> but i wanted to get the tests to pass with that build which i made me find the git failures
[09:18:05] <arschmitz> to do this we will need to update mousewheel too
[09:18:18] <arschmitz> and to get passing tests also update simulate
[09:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> Start with just a PR for our code.
[09:19:37] <arschmitz> one question i had is do we want to add a jquery version to the ones we test with a custom build without the event alias module
[09:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but it's more than just the event alias module.
[09:20:40] <arschmitz> ??
[09:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> We'd want to test with -deprecated as well.
[09:21:17] <arschmitz> oh right
[09:21:35] <arschmitz> ok ill do that as well
[09:22:30] <arschmitz> just call it jquery-alias-deprecated?
[09:22:46] <arschmitz> or jquery-custom
[09:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-custom seems fine.
[09:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> And it should be built against the latest stable 1.x.
[09:23:50] <arschmitz> so obviously this will not pass until simulate and mousewheel are updated
[09:23:57] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so start with just a PR for our code.
[09:24:30] <arschmitz> will do
[09:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be nice to finally have tests for this.
[09:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks everyone.
[09:29:22] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
