[11:04:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you manage to review most of the PRs with 1.4.2 milestone?

[11:05:52] <uGoMobi> but let's be careful and not land PRs in rush
[11:07:17] <uGoMobi> I will review some API docs PRs
[11:07:40] <_|Nix|_> Just for clarification: Who can give :+1 to API docs?
[11:07:56] <agcolom> anyone I think
[11:08:23] <_|Nix|_> OK. Anyone but the submitter of the PR, I assume :)
[11:08:32] <agcolom> correct :-)
[11:08:37] <uGoMobi> right
[11:08:57] <_|Nix|_> Roger that!
[11:09:13] <arschmitz> unless it was a functional change but there are VERY few of thoes in apiu
[11:09:55] <arschmitz> ( actually i cant even think of one ha ha )
[11:10:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: entries2html.xsl?
[11:10:24] <_|Nix|_> ... but anyway ...

[11:10:55] <agcolom> enjoy arschmitz :-)
[11:10:57] <uGoMobi> enjoy the dinner
[11:11:16] <arschmitz> thanks
[11:11:29] <uGoMobi> next week we can work on changing the file structure and discuss 1.5 development
[11:11:40] <_|Nix|_> Can't wait!@
[11:11:47] <uGoMobi> and we should not forget to cherry-pick into 1.4-stable branch
[11:12:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can already start tomorrow when we discuss removing style options with the web-ui-fw team
[11:12:15] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:12:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom _|Nix|_ : is there anything else we should discuss?
[11:12:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, we should reset 1.4-stable to master right after the release and then start diverging it again.
[11:13:03] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:13:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Whoever's doing the release needs to do that extra step.
[11:13:32] <uGoMobi> has been so long that we had to cherry-pick
[11:13:41] <_|Nix|_> For sure :)
[11:13:56] <agcolom> nothing I can think of
[11:13:59] <uGoMobi> so we should remind each other after landing a commit on master
[11:14:33] <uGoMobi> short meeting :)
[11:14:37] <_|Nix|_> Yep :)
[11:14:40] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:14:43] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:14:46] <_|Nix|_> L8R!
[11:14:47] <agcolom> ok
