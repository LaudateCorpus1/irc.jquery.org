[09:03:32] <DaveMethvin> i'll be right there
[09:04:59] <DaveMethvin> meeting time!
[09:05:42] <gibson042> yo yo yo
[09:05:48] <DaveMethvin> looks like markelog gibson042 m_gol  .. anyone else not just idling?
[09:05:48] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:06:11] <DaveMethvin> alrighty
[09:06:39] <DaveMethvin> so lets try to clear out the pull requests this week
[09:06:47] <DaveMethvin> i listed a few on the agenda
[09:07:22] <DaveMethvin> i don't really want to add a bunch of code to .css() and make it sower
[09:07:25] <DaveMethvin> slower*
[09:07:33] <DaveMethvin> it's already pretty slow
[09:07:54] <DaveMethvin> seems like !important isn't that, um, important
[09:08:10] <gibson042> I agree
[09:08:23] <gibson042> I want to back out the old fix, which only made it in on a low-impact pitch
[09:09:10] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah, LOW IMPACT
[09:09:24] <DaveMethvin> ok then sounds like we agree
[09:09:59] <DaveMethvin> so, we'll close the m_gol PR and just revert that patch?
[09:10:51] <gibson042> I like m_gol's tests in the PR
[09:10:54] <gibson042> those should stay
[09:11:25] <DaveMethvin> oh that's a good idea
[09:11:46] <DaveMethvin> m_gol can you land the new unit tests and revert the patch then?
[09:13:07] <DaveMethvin> pull 1531 really bugs me ... how can they screw up the option.value property in IE?
[09:13:16] <DaveMethvin> and of course we'll need to support this FOREVER now
[09:13:27] <DaveMethvin> ugh i mean .text
[09:13:48] <gibson042> jQuery 2.x has a sad sad history so far
[09:14:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah because new browsers have just as bad a history as old ones in screwing up things it seems
[09:15:11] <DaveMethvin> i'm also frustrated that in nearly every case where we have tried to use ES5 functionality it's either broken or horribly slow
[09:15:58] <DaveMethvin> or the objects where we could really use it are host objects, like events, and don't work
[09:16:37] <gibson042> yeah
[09:17:38] <DaveMethvin> so on 1529 the box sizing test ... should we land that for the .1 releases? it seems like we don't need the extra work now
[09:17:48] <DaveMethvin> but i'm wondering what browser might have needed ti
[09:17:49] <DaveMethvin> it
[09:17:58] <DaveMethvin> or maybe it got that way during refactoring
[09:18:31] <gibson042> looks good for the .1's to me
[09:19:23] <gibson042> whatever required the old method looks to have been fixed in recent jQuery-supported versions
[09:19:48] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 re https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1514#issuecomment-37201036
[09:20:03] <DaveMethvin> i agree we are always on shakey ground with any cross-document manip
[09:20:13] <DaveMethvin> people LOVE to do it and don't understand the implications
[09:20:30] <DaveMethvin> but we can't protect them from most of those problems
[09:20:48] <gibson042> right
[09:20:54] <markelog> any reason not to use adoptNode is good reason to me
[09:21:01] <markelog> )
[09:21:08] <DaveMethvin> AGREED!
[09:21:10] <gibson042> we can't control that it *happens* to work when the XML is right and the browsers align, but there's no reason to guarantee it
[09:21:17] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:22:09] <DaveMethvin> so basically let's get rid of that unit test
[09:24:11] <DaveMethvin> or should we just skip them for android? i feel like leaving all the tests as-is indicates we're letting android 2.3 get worse support
[09:24:23] <DaveMethvin> but it's really that it happened to work before on everyone else
[09:24:25] <gibson042> the tests are no good as is
[09:24:45] <gibson042> we can rewrite it to single document or drop entirely
[09:25:07] <DaveMethvin> agreed, it's one or the other
[09:25:14] <markelog> yep
[09:25:34] <gibson042> I saw Pull Requestor's choice :)
[09:25:37] <gibson042> *say
[09:29:12] <DaveMethvin> oh good, my iphone unit test fail went away
[09:29:40] <DaveMethvin> after i landed that bunch of stuff i was having a fail on the iphone, and i reproed it locally through browserstack
[09:29:55] <DaveMethvin> but then i went to bisect it a couple of days later, and poof it was gone
[09:30:03] <DaveMethvin> SO STAY GONE!
[09:31:17] <DaveMethvin> so any ideas on what we should do to make old IE tests pass the animation tests?
[09:31:38] <DaveMethvin> i really don't want to revert fake timers
[09:31:49] <DaveMethvin> but it seems related
[09:32:05] <DaveMethvin> it just always seems to stop at some random point
[09:32:17] <DaveMethvin> or at least it seemed random when i looked at it a while back
[09:32:34] <markelog> didn't we fix that?
[09:32:46] <markelog> i remember m_gol patch for this
[09:32:52] <markelog> or even a couple of them
[09:33:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah there were some, but not fixy enough :)
[09:33:33] <DaveMethvin> we even patch a few things in the testswarm injected code to protect those setTimeouts
[09:33:34] <markelog> it is a swarm problem
[09:33:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah i agree
[09:33:46] <DaveMethvin> never happens to me locally
[09:33:58] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, let me double check the inject.js code
[09:34:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah, both setTimeout and clearTimeout are protected https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/inject.js
[09:34:48] <markelog> so if this only related to swarm and we're planning to switch karma - we can wait on it?
[09:34:57] <DaveMethvin> sure, that's actually a good idea
[09:35:59] <markelog> hope karma project will fit for our needs
[09:36:07] <DaveMethvin> it's worth a try!
[09:36:43] <DaveMethvin> so any thoughts on when we should change the .data() api? should we leave it as-is until 1.12 and 2.2?
[09:36:56] <DaveMethvin> or is it broken enough that we should go ahead and change behavior now?
[09:37:33] <DaveMethvin> always a little hesitant to change that kind of thing on a .1 but the 2.x behavior with both camelized and not is kind of strange
[09:37:37] <gibson042> let's save the changes
[09:37:40] <DaveMethvin> and not compat with 1.x
[09:38:01] <gibson042> it's weird and inconsistent, but only visible for edge cases
[09:38:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah, true
[09:38:09] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:38:14] <markelog> +1
[09:38:52] <DaveMethvin> alright, that's about all i have ... I'd really like to get most stuff landed this week if possible
[09:38:59] <DaveMethvin> the bug list is pretty small i think
[09:39:06] <DaveMethvin> anyone else have anything?
[09:39:37] <DaveMethvin> then we're done!
[09:39:52] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys
[09:40:15] <gibson042> see you in -dev
