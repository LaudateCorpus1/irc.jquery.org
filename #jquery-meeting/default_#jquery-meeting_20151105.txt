[12:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer
[12:03:54] <M4rius> hi there
[12:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> So we've had a lot of action since last week.
[12:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> Mostly from jzaefferer.
[12:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Fixed warning about deprecated `Touch.webkit*` properties
[12:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/225
[12:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> Replaced `touch-action` value list with a link to the spec
[12:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/210
[12:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> For that, we just gutted the content in the README (just for `touch-action` values).
[12:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> Added a `grunt watch` task so PEP will auto-rebuild during development.
[12:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/236
[12:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> Moved `pointerevents.js` to the `src` directory, which shouldn't really affect anyone, even us.
[12:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/239
[12:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> But the big thing that I'd like to discuss is that jzaefferer disabled functional tests until we can fix the timeout issue.
[12:08:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/commit/28a8a417b6783c62579f6384d82e02eecf963275
[12:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> We should try to get that fixed soon.
[12:11:42] <scott_gonzalez>  I also got the 0.4.0 release out this morning.
[12:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/releases/tag/0.4.0
[12:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> Still need to announce, but wanted to wait until the meeting to see if anyone had anything to include in the announcement.
[12:14:26] <M4rius> I am afraid it
[12:14:46] <M4rius> 's mostly the two of us
[12:16:13] <M4rius> 0.4.0 sounds great to show progress.
[12:18:26] <M4rius> I got some time on my hands again and can make some stabs at the functional tests issue. Been dabbling with the PEP integration for jQuery UI, but iOS gives quite a few grievances
[12:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great.
[12:20:19] <M4rius> Earlier today I went ahead with the PR for web tests for capture issue
[12:20:21] <M4rius> https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/2306
[12:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wonderful.
[12:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess that's all for today.
[12:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping some people for the W3C PR.
[12:29:15] <M4rius> Ok great, thank you.
[12:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> Since nobody with push access to that repo is in the meeting right now.
[14:04:42] <arschmitz> agcolom: cgack: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: apsdehal: sfrisk meeting time
[14:04:52] <cgack> Howdy
[14:04:55] <jasperdegroot> hola
[14:05:00] <apsdehal> hi
[14:05:20] <arschmitz> sorry got stuck in traffic coming back from my new house
[14:06:16] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=573738029
[14:06:55] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you're moving?
[14:07:01] <apsdehal> So daylight saving is on for you guys.
[14:07:08] <arschmitz> yes started last week
[14:07:21] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: oh nice, congrats with new house
[14:07:27] <apsdehal> Congrats
[14:07:35] <arschmitz> thank you lot of wok
[14:07:36] <arschmitz> work
[14:07:41] <jasperdegroot> I can imagine
[14:07:53] <arschmitz> thankfully only about 8 miles lol
[14:08:18] <apsdehal> I might miss some meetings while daylight savings are on because it gets very late in night here.
[14:08:45] <arschmitz> apsdehal: no problem when do you switch there next week?
[14:08:56] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:09:31] <apsdehal> India doesn't shifts, we got the same timings whole year :p
[14:09:32] <arschmitz> well since we have both gabrielschulhof and apsdehal why dont we start with the test bootstrap
[14:09:37] <arschmitz> apsdehal: ohhh
[14:09:56] <apsdehal> I have been working on navigation changes in integration
[14:10:06] <apsdehal> That is the biggest one
[14:10:07] <arschmitz> most countries switch but the US switches a different week starting a few years ago really annoying
[14:10:18] <arschmitz> ok
[14:12:19] <agcolom> Sorry, just arrived
[14:12:32] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: any progresson your side of things?
[14:13:13] <gabrielschulhof> Not much, unfortunately, because I have been doing a lot of IoT work :/ In fact, I'll probably be super-busy with that until mid-december. I'm hoping to get it to a stable plateau but it seems like a lot of work now.
[14:13:30] <gabrielschulhof> s/plateau/plateau before that/
[14:13:30] <b-ot> Correction, <gabrielschulhof> Not much, unfortunately, because I have been doing a lot of IoT work :/ In fact, I'll probably be super-busy with that until mid-december. I'm hoping to get it to a stable plateau before that but it seems like a lot of work now.
[14:13:52] <arschmitz> so probably not looking good for beta this year then?
[14:14:10] <gabrielschulhof> No, unfortunately :(
[14:14:37] <arschmitz> ok
[14:14:42] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, I'm hoping for the best, but right now I'm getting a lot of feedback on my code, and I need to address that pronto ...
[14:14:53] <arschmitz> ok
[14:15:22] <gabrielschulhof> Sorry I don't have better news :/
[14:15:27] <arschmitz> its fine
[14:15:42] <gabrielschulhof> I can lurk around and help apsdehal for sure though.
[14:16:04] <arschmitz> it was selectmenu i was more concerned about
[14:16:17] <apsdehal> hopefully once I get all the integration tests shifted, it should all work
[14:16:25] <arschmitz> we have been almost 2 years since a new release
[14:16:38] <apsdehal> Mostly the problem is with events. They will only be left out
[14:16:51] <arschmitz> we need to get a beta out to people i get weekly emails from people asking if JQM is dead
[14:17:25] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Is there a way I can test whole navigation suit on browser, instead of going to each html individually?
[14:17:36] <arschmitz> apsdehal: no
[14:19:16] <jasperdegroot> this is not the right time for that but I really think we need to talk again about the way we work
[14:19:39] <jasperdegroot> I know that are reasons like that we had to wait for button to land in UI etc
[14:19:42] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes after this we need to do smaller focused releases but yeah another time
[14:19:53] <jasperdegroot> but no release in almost 2 years is bad
[14:19:59] <arschmitz> yes it is very bad
[14:20:01] <jasperdegroot> agreed
[14:20:55] <arschmitz> at this point its mostly just selectmenu and panel that are blocking us along with some issue cleanup
[14:21:05] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:21:08] <jasperdegroot> and table?
[14:21:13] <arschmitz> right table
[14:21:39] <gabrielschulhof> ... and panel is really tricky because it already has classes, but with different semantics :/
[14:21:59] <arschmitz> yeah we should think of a way to do as little to panel as possible
[14:22:00] <jasperdegroot> can we get them in decent shape without adding classes option?
[14:22:13] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: selectmenu cant function without classes
[14:22:26] <jasperdegroot> for selectmenu just fix icons maybe
[14:22:34] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: it cant actually function
[14:22:43] <jasperdegroot> I see
[14:22:52] <cgack> I can grab one of those after next week (i'm on away next week) and help alleviate some stress
[14:23:22] <arschmitz> cgack: coordinate with gabrielschulhof he started all 3 of the pending widgets
[14:23:35] <arschmitz> but that would be great
[14:23:41] <cgack> roger, wilco
[14:24:27] <jasperdegroot> let's make a checklist in the tickets (open tickets for each widget if not already there) and list what is the minimum that needs to be done
[14:24:28] <arschmitz> things should be less crazy for me after this weekend when im in the new house so i should be able to help and review quickly
[14:24:45] <arschmitz> panel is the one that concerns me
[14:24:57] <arschmitz> if we can find a way to buy down on panel i would be ok with it
[14:25:03] <arschmitz> selectmenu is very close i think
[14:25:23] <arschmitz> table was pretty solid for re-write and just needs classes i think
[14:25:24] <jasperdegroot> is panel broken in 1.5-dev?
[14:25:32] <arschmitz> yes
[14:25:38] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-mobile/tree/7731-selectmenu-classes-option
[14:25:42] <arschmitz> because it has a classes option
[14:25:52] <arschmitz> but its not "THE" classes option
[14:25:57] <arschmitz> so using it will break things
[14:26:09] <arschmitz> it follows different semantics
[14:26:19] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Feel free to pull and take it over.
[14:26:25] <jasperdegroot> ok but can we fix it without adding THE classes option?
[14:26:33] <arschmitz> no
[14:26:41] <jasperdegroot> aww ok
[14:26:43] <gabrielschulhof> That would be super confusing.
[14:26:43] <arschmitz> the classes option is part of the widget factory
[14:26:46] <arschmitz> you cant remove it
[14:27:03] <jasperdegroot> I understand
[14:27:21] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: I'll see what I can do. Thanks!
[14:27:32] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Thank /you/!
[14:27:57] <jasperdegroot> I am getting close with demos
[14:28:06] <jasperdegroot> I guess the other big thing is documentation
[14:28:08] <jasperdegroot> right?
[14:28:09] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesome thats an important one before beta
[14:28:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes iv been working on some of that as i have time
[14:28:27] <arschmitz> the upgrade guide is mostly done
[14:28:29] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: ... though you may want to start with another widget, because I got stuck with selectmenu, because it needs a newer version of qunit-assert-classes, which basically in turn needs the whole testing AMD infrastructure.
[14:28:33] <jasperdegroot> oh that's great
[14:28:49] <arschmitz> cgack: maybe take over table
[14:28:57] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: wasent that basicly just needing classes
[14:29:06] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: maybe it's a good idea if you write a blog post and tweet about what we are working on
[14:29:08] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: ^
[14:29:11] <arschmitz> the rewrite was already given the thumbs up
[14:29:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: might not be a bad idea
[14:29:36] <jasperdegroot> to explain the merge with UI makes that we need to make some big changes which takes a lot of time
[14:29:53] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: For table, we were talking about factoring out the UI for the column picker (popup, button, checkboxes, controlgroup)
[14:30:05] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: ... and adding an idle loop for refresh()
[14:30:06] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: that can wait
[14:30:14] <arschmitz> i dont think those are critical for 1.5
[14:30:20] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:30:21] <cgack> just classes for 1.5 on table then?
[14:30:25] <gabrielschulhof> Then yeag, just classes.
[14:30:34] <arschmitz> cgack: and the re-write so far
[14:30:57] <arschmitz> thankfully the re-write bits left can be done as non breaking incremental changes
[14:30:58] <arschmitz> and wait
[14:31:10] <cgack> right. pull in table-review on 1.5-dev and add classes?
[14:31:15] <agcolom> jasperdegroot: yes, that'd be good
[14:32:39] <arschmitz> cgack: perfect
[14:32:50] <cgack> gabrielschulhof:  is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/7360-table-review the repo of record for table?
[14:33:13] <jasperdegroot> let's make sure we have a checklist of what needs to be done
[14:33:22] <jasperdegroot> also for documentation
[14:33:25] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: maybe in between demo work you could start trying to label issues that are must have for 1.5?
[14:33:28] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Yeah, but that's very old.
[14:33:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: sure, will do
[14:33:43] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i think we have a bunch that are kinda must haves
[14:33:44] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: I think if you have any use out of that, it's mostly for inspiration.
[14:33:55] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: just use your best judgement and we can review as a group
[14:34:06] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:34:09] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: ... and it does the breaking up of the columntoggle widget, which we have just deemed non-critical.
[14:34:10] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: so was navbar :) I'll start from there and see what I can do with it.. ping you if needed
[14:34:25] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: if its done its fine
[14:34:41] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: OK. Great! By all means!
[14:34:43] <arschmitz> or close to it
[14:35:19] <gabrielschulhof> The truth is that, breaking up the widget like that has forced me to do the logic in pretty cooky ways. They may not be the best.
[14:35:41] <jasperdegroot> is there anything that can easily be picked up by others? In other words ... label with "help wanted"?
[14:35:45] <gabrielschulhof> You'll see ... <lightning/><thunder/>
[14:36:03] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: you are scaring me... so should I just go to the existing table and use classes option and we can do review for 1.6?
[14:36:13] <jasperdegroot> we can do that with documentation tickets probably
[14:36:51] <cgack> jasperdegroot: i'd love a checklist 1.5 issue that we could use for sanity checks
[14:37:08] <jasperdegroot> yeah me too
[14:37:16] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Up to you, of course, just know that the branch goes into a direction which, if you can salvage, great, just add classes and call it a day, but if not, then you're better off starting on 1.5-dev.
[14:38:18] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: But hey! Let the code do the talking, right?
[14:38:26] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: It's been a while since I've looked at it.
[14:38:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok your doing demos and triage
[14:38:37] <jasperdegroot> check
[14:38:37] <arschmitz> cgack: your going to take over table
[14:38:45] <arschmitz> apsdehal: your working on tests
[14:38:48] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: okay, i'll probably explore both after i'm AFK next week and try to figure it out.  review will be the first check since a bunch of work went into it
[14:39:02] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: in what time you have lets focus on selectmenu
[14:39:03] <cgack> arschmitz: that is the plan right now
[14:39:07] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: Good plan!
[14:39:11] <apsdehal> Cool
[14:39:18] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK.
[14:39:36] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: and also think of what we can do with panel with the least effort
[14:39:42] <arschmitz> and i will too
[14:39:51] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I might even backport your qunit-assert-classes changes just to keep that going.
[14:39:55] <arschmitz> im going to work on getting ui master onto 1.5 dev
[14:40:04] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thats fine
[14:40:42] <arschmitz> agcolom: if you have any time if you could look at the API and identify anything you know we need to do there and make sure there are issues and label them
[14:40:53] <agcolom> sure
[14:41:14] <arschmitz> and ill prioritize reviews and anything to keep everyone unblocked
[14:41:30] <jasperdegroot> how about merging 1.5-dev in master?
[14:41:41] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: as soon as selectmenu lands
[14:41:52] <arschmitz> selectmenu is to broken to pull into master
[14:41:54] <jasperdegroot> that's another thing ... people didn't see a commit on master for very long time
[14:42:00] <arschmitz> yup
[14:42:00] <jasperdegroot> ok clear
[14:42:11] <arschmitz> thats the only blocker on going back to master
[14:42:24] <cgack> soon, they will see many :) jasperdegroot
[14:42:30] <jasperdegroot> haha yes
[14:42:32] <arschmitz> yup it will flood lol
[14:43:33] <arschmitz> ok so everyone has what they need to focus on to move towards getting 1.5 out the door
[14:43:48] <cgack> i'm good!
[14:44:11] <jasperdegroot> ok great
[14:44:13] <arschmitz> ok lets just keep trying to make progress
[14:44:31] <gabrielschulhof> *emphatic nod*
[14:44:47] <arschmitz> we are getting very close
[14:45:15] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else they would like to talk about?
[14:45:27] <gabrielschulhof> Actually, something just came to mind ...
[14:46:01] <gabrielschulhof> We could develop new minor versions in n.nn-dev like we're doing now, and keep landing bugfixes on master whenever we can ...
[14:46:13] <gabrielschulhof> That way, we could roll releases off of master every once in a while.
[14:46:26] <gabrielschulhof> Like, micro releases.
[14:46:44] <arschmitz> its a possibility for sure
[14:46:52] <agcolom> +1
[14:46:56] <arschmitz> but lets just focus on getting 1.5 out and re-asses for 1.6
[14:47:06] <arschmitz> how we want to handle releases
[14:47:18] <arschmitz> but i think moving to much smaller focused releases is what we need to do
[14:47:19] <gabrielschulhof> Make an effort to fix, like a-bug-a-week, and if we all do that, in a month we'll have a potential release.
[14:47:29] <agcolom> I won't be able to attend next week. I'm meeting Her Royal Highness Princess Royal (Princess Anne, the Queen's daughter).
[14:47:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats fine cgack is away too
[14:47:48] <jasperdegroot> I like this approach http://blog.atom.io/2015/10/21/introducing-the-atom-beta-channel.html
[14:47:54] <gabrielschulhof> agcolom: Dang! Say hi for me ;)
[14:48:02] <cgack> agcolom: awesome!
[14:48:12] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ill take a look
[14:48:14] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: say hi from me ;)
[14:48:21] <agcolom> :-)
[14:48:30] <arschmitz> agcolom: have fun
[14:48:37] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[14:48:40] <arschmitz> you finnally get to dress up for your big ball
[14:48:46] <jasperdegroot> lol
[14:48:50] <agcolom> indeed ;-)
[14:48:57] <jasperdegroot> yeah probably no hard rock this time
[14:49:03] <arschmitz> i wouldnt think so
[14:49:17] <agcolom> yes, they even specify the length of the dress :-)
[14:49:27] <arschmitz> ha ha
[14:49:44] <arschmitz> i can see them measuring at the door
[14:49:56] <arschmitz> nope you cant come in 1cm too short
[14:49:57] <jasperdegroot> haha
[14:50:06] <cgack> ha
[14:50:12] <gabrielschulhof> 1cm? Try, like, 2mm :)
[14:50:18] <arschmitz> lol
[14:50:28] <gabrielschulhof> Wait, lemme stretch that ... gnnnn ... mmmmph ... there!
[14:51:56] <arschmitz> ok does anyone have anything else?
[14:51:57] <agcolom> ha ha ;-) I've gone for the safe below the knee option :-)
[14:52:28] <jasperdegroot> I am good
[14:52:47] <arschmitz> ok thank you everyone
[14:52:53] <arschmitz> see everyone back on dev
