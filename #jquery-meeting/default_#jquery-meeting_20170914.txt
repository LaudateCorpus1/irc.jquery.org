[14:01:43] <arschmitz> jQuery Mobile meeting time
[14:01:45] <apsdehal____> Hey
[14:02:06] <arschmitz> is there anyone here or lurking for the meeting
[14:02:32] <apsdehal____> Are my messages going through?
[14:02:37] <arschmitz> yes
[14:02:44] <apsdehal____> ok, cool
[14:02:48] <arschmitz> sorry i meant anyone besides you
[14:02:48] <jimmich> yes
[14:02:59] <arschmitz> jimmich: hi
[14:03:06] <apsdehal____> jimmich: Hey
[14:03:54] <arschmitz> So the big thing this week is the announcement i mentioned in the issues which ill mention here first but there is a blog post coming
[14:04:16] <apsdehal____> hmm
[14:04:42] <arschmitz> its no mystery to most that there has been a huge decline in activity which was related mostly to changes with in the foundation which we are a part of
[14:05:00] <arschmitz> we lost many team members as a result of these changes
[14:05:46] <arschmitz> sadly jQuery UI has suffered much the same fate
[14:06:09] <arschmitz> and we depend on jQuery UI and share some team
[14:06:40] <arschmitz> so in attempt to jump start both projects again there are going to be some changes
[14:06:58] <arschmitz> the two teams will be merging
[14:07:08] <arschmitz> and i will be leading both teams
[14:07:29] <arschmitz> we are also going to start looking for component maintainers
[14:07:52] <arschmitz> people who are willing to take on and be responsible for some individual component with no need to work on the rest of the libs
[14:08:13] <arschmitz> so if there is someone that just wants to work on select menu they could be the maintainer of that component
[14:09:12] <arschmitz> part of the blog post will be asking for people interested in the projects to step forward and join the team either as a regular or component maintainer
[14:10:38] <arschmitz> i would also like to look at other things that might help with community involvment and team building
[14:10:42] <apsdehal____> Great, that can bring in some folks as they won't  need to share the same burden as maintaining the whole project, but still divides the responsibility very well.
[14:10:44] <arschmitz> like is IRC still the right choice
[14:11:44] <apsdehal____> I also feel like IRC is not the right choice anymore. Many open source projects are moving towards alternatives such as slack and discord where people are easily reachable.
[14:13:26] <arschmitz> we will be looking at any ideas any one has to recruit more help on the projects and get them moving forward again
[14:16:41] <arschmitz> does anyone have any thoughts or feedback?
[14:17:12] <apsdehal____> I would say first we should open a issue on repo itself about contributors needed.
[14:17:45] <apsdehal____> Then we can post the blog post on various tech networks to increase the audience.
[14:18:09] <apsdehal____> Other thing would be to go to conferences and look for potential contributors there.
[14:19:06] <apsdehal____> Also, scheduling some events where people can come in and fix some bugs would be great
[14:23:07] <apsdehal____> Anybody else have any feedback?
[14:23:57] <apsdehal____> Otherwise, we can discuss 1.5?
[14:26:52] <apsdehal____> arschmitz: ^
[14:27:32] <arschmitz> well as far as conferences events etc
[14:27:41] <arschmitz> there is no budget for the projects any more
[14:27:54] <arschmitz> and so no budget for travel confrences or anything like that
[14:28:12] <arschmitz> i was going to open an issue already
[14:31:59] <apsdehal____> Ok, about 1.5, we have the API 98% ready, there is one PR pending on you
[14:32:25] <apsdehal____> The issues that people have opened are not really blockers.
[14:32:39] <apsdehal____> Most of the stuff as I have seen in API documentation is working fine
[14:32:54] <arschmitz> ok
[14:33:00] <arschmitz> ill review that PR
[14:33:29] <apsdehal____> Thanks
