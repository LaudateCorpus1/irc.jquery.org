[11:00:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz agcolom gseguin
[11:00:43] <arschmitz> hi
[11:00:53] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:02:22] <cgack> hey guys mind if I sit in today?
[11:02:34] <uGoMobi> cgack: hey!
[11:02:42] <uGoMobi> not at all, welcome!
[11:02:43] <arschmitz> cgack: no not at all
[11:02:55] <cgack> super! thanks
[11:03:53] <uGoMobi> not sure if _|Nix|_ remember that meeting is hour earlier this week
[11:04:00] <uGoMobi> and agcolom
[11:04:09] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:04:15] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:04:27] <uGoMobi> ok let's start
[11:04:39] <uGoMobi> short agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc#gid=13
[11:04:57] <uGoMobi> I added removal of style options
[11:05:31] <uGoMobi> I just wanted to be sure that the summary that I wrote on the wiki page matches with what we discussed last week and during the week on -dev
[11:05:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz and _|Nix|_ can you confirm
[11:06:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i already looked and i think it sounds correct
[11:06:13] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[11:06:38] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:07:23] <uGoMobi> I think we should take a look at the code of each of the widgets
[11:07:37] <uGoMobi> link: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.5-Style-options-removal
[11:07:53] <uGoMobi> just to see if there is anything we didn't think of
[11:08:06] <uGoMobi> and then we can start with button widget
[11:08:15] <_|Nix|_> I need to remove the discussion about expanded-icon and collapsedIcon, since we're not touching those.
[11:08:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[11:08:48] <uGoMobi> I guess that's it
[11:08:58] <gseguin> here now
[11:08:59] <uGoMobi> page / pagecontainer event demo
[11:09:02] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:09:08] <gseguin> hey all
[11:09:15] <uGoMobi> or "no demo" I should say I think
[11:09:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz?
[11:09:40] <arschmitz> just one sec
[11:09:47] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:11:44] <arschmitz> ok sorry
[11:11:47] <arschmitz> was pushing the demo
[11:12:04] <uGoMobi> ok, no problem
[11:14:51] <arschmitz> ha ha
[11:14:56] <arschmitz> iv been typeing in the wrong chanel
[11:15:12] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:15:17] <uGoMobi> yeah, I just noticed
[11:15:26] <arschmitz> ok ill copy and paste
[11:15:29] <uGoMobi> copy paste
[11:15:36] <arschmitz> so my original idea i started over a year ago :( for this was to make a set of pages that when you navigated between them it would log / alert the events as they took place
[11:15:49] <arschmitz> so you could see the order in which they happened and if you used alerts it pauses execution
[11:15:59] <arschmitz> so you can see the current state of the page
[11:16:09] <arschmitz> while i was working on this it became clear more info was needed besides just the name that the event data and ui object would be nice to be able to be seen
[11:16:16] <arschmitz> then i thought wow a description of the event would be great too
[11:16:30] <arschmitz> but copy and pasting all the from docs seemed not fun
[11:16:47] <arschmitz> so i set up to pull in the xml and parse it
[11:17:15] <arschmitz> which gave me the idea this could be set to work for any event in the docs with out previously knowing what exist or hardcoding any of it
[11:17:54] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:17:54] <arschmitz> so instead of a demo i made a debugger tool that you pass an options object to with what widgets / categories of events you want to listen to
[11:18:06] <arschmitz> then a made a demo using the debugger for page events
[11:18:58] <arschmitz> so now if people are having issues with the events and the data passed with them
[11:19:32] <arschmitz> they can just include the debugger and call it with whatever events they need and it will log / alert them
[11:19:51] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:20:05] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/page-events-demo/demos/page-events/
[11:20:06] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds great
[11:20:21] <arschmitz> and https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-event-debugger
[11:20:42] <arschmitz> that demo is not quite done
[11:20:51] <arschmitz> i need to add the popup and some internal pages
[11:20:55] <arschmitz> but it gives the idea
[11:22:15] <arschmitz> that demo is showing deprecatedevents pageevents ( nav) page events ( widget ) and pagecontainer events
[11:22:37] <arschmitz> you can set it to show or not show deprecated events
[11:23:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: going to play a bit with it later
[11:23:33] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:23:54] <gseguin> for depreciation, dojo had a dojo.deprecated( msg, removedIn ) function. A similar model could work for us
[11:24:39] <arschmitz> we could but i think the notes in the docs are enough
[11:24:56] <arschmitz> and the changelog
[11:25:00] <arschmitz> and the upgrade guide
[11:25:15] <gseguin> It's good to have a message at runtime, do developers read docs? That's be a first ;)
[11:25:26] <uGoMobi> hehe
[11:25:44] <arschmitz> non of the other projects do this with out a special plugin ( migrate )
[11:25:54] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: console.log is a dicy affair. It can cause runtime errors on IE.
[11:25:57] <uGoMobi> yeah, might be nice but not a high priority
[11:26:07] <arschmitz> so unless the other projects decide to do this we shouldnt
[11:26:15] <gseguin> just a suggestion
[11:26:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you just make sure it exists first
[11:26:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and so it begins.
[11:26:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah of course its not a bad idea
[11:27:01] <arschmitz> we just want to make sure we stay consistent for how we handle things like deprecation
[11:27:18] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. I think we're doing well so far.
[11:27:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you ever look at this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/tools
[11:28:30] <uGoMobi> I just remembered we had some sort of page events log
[11:28:36] <_|Nix|_> Woah ... our project has a tools/ subdir? :O
[11:28:43] <uGoMobi> anyway, might be something we want to clean up
[11:28:52] <gseguin> arschmitz: https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/_base/kernel.js#L183-L204
[11:29:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: kernel.js - sounds ambitious :)
[11:29:19] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: :)
[11:29:27] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:29:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i had no idea that existed either :/
[11:30:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats kinda the idea i had started with but this is much more robust
[11:30:45] <arschmitz> and is more then just page events its any event we define in the api
[11:31:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, what you have made sounds more complete
[11:31:55] <arschmitz> i had no idea these tools existed lol
[11:32:02] <uGoMobi> if we don't use tools/ anymore we should remove it
[11:33:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: your debugger is going to replace the demo, right?
[11:34:12] <arschmitz> the demo uses the debugger
[11:34:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... you could set things up as a bookmarklet. Idea taken from tools/log-page-events.html
[11:35:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then you cant run at the right time
[11:35:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because you want to be able to catch events on inital page load
[11:36:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right. Bookmarklets get the page at the point where you click on them.
[11:36:16] <_|Nix|_> NM.
[11:36:18] <arschmitz> yup
[11:37:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: demo in the jQM demos?
[11:38:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I mean, is you plan to add a demo to the JQM demos?
[11:39:03] <uGoMobi> your*
[11:39:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i posted a link to one
[11:39:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ahhh, I only saw the second link
[11:39:57] <uGoMobi> now I get it, sorry
[11:40:02] <arschmitz> ok :)
[11:40:47] <uGoMobi> are we ready to change file structure and break everything? :)
[11:40:55] <uGoMobi> gseguin ^^
[11:41:05] <gseguin> F YEAH!
[11:41:17] <gseguin> death to prefixes!
[11:41:27] <_|Nix|_> Bring that suckah oan!
[11:41:29] <gseguin> I can rebase that branch and be ready today
[11:41:30] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:41:51] <uGoMobi> if tests pass I don't see why we should wait to land it
[11:41:53] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait!
[11:41:58] <uGoMobi> oh oh
[11:41:58] <_|Nix|_> We need to reset --hard 1.4-stable
[11:42:06] <_|Nix|_> It's missing some cherry-picks.
[11:42:28] <uGoMobi> any 1.5 changes on master already?
[11:42:40] <uGoMobi> if not, just make new 1.4-stable branch :)
[11:42:41] <_|Nix|_> Not AFAIK.
[11:42:47] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's what I meant.
[11:43:12] <agcolom> Hi! I just forgot about the timeshift!
[11:43:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hey
[11:43:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey!
[11:45:17] <uGoMobi> I missed a topic... https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/178
[11:45:24] <uGoMobi> the download builder
[11:45:58] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Before you land the rename, please reset 1.4-stable to master and please add 1.4-stable to .travis.yml!
[11:45:58] <gseguin> yeah I'm supposed to make our builder modular so UI can use our buildCSSBundle function
[11:46:15] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ok
[11:46:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Like, they'll copy the JS file?
[11:46:34] <gseguin> so force push to 1.4-stable right?
[11:46:54] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: no like exporting to npm and them having a dependency on it
[11:47:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, cool!
[11:48:14] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah except it's not designed that way so it may require a bunch of work
[11:49:16] <_|Nix|_> Gotcha!
[11:50:06] <uGoMobi> great
[11:50:21] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss?
[11:50:40] <_|Nix|_> I'm good ...
[11:50:52] <agcolom> just that I was looking at some crazy old issues on the api docs
[11:51:18] <agcolom> I think some can now be closed. I'll grab arschmitz one day if that's ok
[11:51:35] <arschmitz> agcolom: sounds good
[11:51:37] <uGoMobi> yeah, nice to do some triage
[11:51:50] <cgack> I was going to add that I started looking at some issues this week and trying to triage them to clean up the old ones if thats cool with you all
[11:51:50] <agcolom> but I'll prepare something in advance so that we can go through it quickly
[11:52:05] <_|Nix|_> cgack: +1
[11:52:06] <gseguin> hey cgack!
[11:52:11] <uGoMobi> yeah, probably most effective
[11:52:14] <agcolom> hey cgack !
[11:52:15] <gseguin> thanks for the help!
[11:52:24] <uGoMobi> cgack: awesome!
[11:53:14] <uGoMobi> cgack: I think you know most of us already
[11:53:26] <uGoMobi> cgack: except _|Nix|_ maybe
[11:53:29] <arschmitz> cgack: thats fine
[11:54:12] <arschmitz> cgack: i try to pay attention but if there is one you think can be closed feel free to ping me and ill double check and close them
[11:54:46] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I haven't been strong with the in-person thing of late :/
[11:54:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cgack (Cory) has been doing talks at jQuery conf Austin, San Diego, and Vienna
[11:55:06] <cgack> awesome. not sure i've met you _|Nix|_ so 'hello'
[11:55:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and portland
[11:55:20] <arschmitz> so you might have caught his talk there
[11:55:21] <_|Nix|_> Well, I was there in portland ...
[11:55:26] <uGoMobi> cgack: _|Nix|_ = Gabriel
[11:55:41] <uGoMobi> oh that's right
[11:55:46] <cgack> we may have met there, i'm horrible with names
[11:56:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was the guy waering the same shorts all week :)
[11:56:13] <_|Nix|_> cgack: Same here ... takes months for the connection between the name and the face to become permanent ... *sigh*
[11:56:20] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:56:53] <cgack> I'll be sure to ping you all if there are questions with some of the issues. some of the old ones just need some jsbin love
[11:57:15] <_|Nix|_> cgack: Awesome! Looking forward to it!
[11:57:15] <uGoMobi> ok, since we start talking about _|Nix|_ his shorts we are probably ready here
[11:57:15] <arschmitz> cool
[11:57:22] <uGoMobi> great!
[11:57:23] <arschmitz> probably
[11:57:27] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:57:34] <uGoMobi> ok thanks all
[11:57:40] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:57:46] <_|Nix|_> L8R
