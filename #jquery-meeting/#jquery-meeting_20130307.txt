[11:00:42] <gseguin> Hello
[11:00:59] <gseguin> The jQuery Mobile weekly team meeting is about to start
[11:01:01] <arschmitz> hi
[11:01:06] <johnbender> HELLO
[11:01:14] <johnbender> this is going to be short and sweet
[11:01:21] * _|Nix|_ waves
[11:01:24] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:01:25] <johnbender> are we missing anyone?
[11:01:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Ping!
[11:01:48] <gseguin> she's here
[11:01:54] <johnbender> agcolom: yah sorry, I completely failed to take a surve
[11:01:55] <agcolom> I'm here :-)
[11:02:01] <johnbender> working on getting all the jquery methods we depend on
[11:02:11] <johnbender> alright
[11:02:15] <johnbender> one more minute and then we'll start
[11:02:15] <agcolom> johnbender: no problem :-)
[11:02:19] <agcolom> ok
[11:03:36] <johnbender> ok lets do this
[11:03:38] <johnbender> gseguin: you're up
[11:03:43] <johnbender> no particular order here
[11:03:47] <johnbender> just going to make it fast
[11:03:57] <gseguin> Landed grunt 0.4 changes on master
[11:04:04] <gseguin> you probably have noticed
[11:04:05] <johnbender> win
[11:04:06] <uGoMobi> nice gseguin !
[11:04:07] <johnbender> so good
[11:04:16] <_|Nix|_> Ka-tching!
[11:04:18] <gseguin> Added TravisCI config
[11:04:23] <johnbender> win x 2
[11:04:24] <johnbender> so good
[11:04:28] <uGoMobi> are we green?
[11:04:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yep
[11:04:33] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:04:37] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yeah!
[11:04:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You also added grunt-0.4 to 1.3-stable, right?
[11:04:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm going to shut off phantom master in a day or two
[11:04:53] <gseguin> backported to 1.3-stable yes
[11:04:55] <uGoMobi> great
[11:04:55] <johnbender> so good
[11:04:57] <johnbender> so good
[11:05:07] <_|Nix|_> Niceness!
[11:05:08] <johnbender> gseguin: first beer in portland is on me
[11:05:11] <johnbender> don't let me forget
[11:05:24] <gseguin> johnbender: I won't forget when it comes to free booze :D
[11:05:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think he gets one from each of us.
[11:05:37] * gseguin likes that job
[11:05:47] <johnbender> gseguin: done?
[11:06:03] <_|Nix|_> Test Your Might! (queue Mortal Kombat theme)
[11:06:06] <gseguin> there are probably some things to iron out, let me know if you find problems
[11:06:16] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:06:32] <gseguin> next is testswarm
[11:06:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm going to try to use jQM with web-ui-fw to do custom builds across both libs.
[11:06:45] <Krinkle> Hi
[11:06:45] <johnbender> gseguin: good luck with that *grimace*
[11:07:02] <johnbender> Krinkle: hello
[11:07:03] <gseguin> oh and other jQuery projects are interested in the TravisCI thing so I'll work with them on making it happen
[11:07:06] <johnbender> YAR
[11:07:13] <johnbender> big interest at the meeting yesterday
[11:07:13] <gseguin> hey Krinkle
[11:07:17] <Krinkle> As a reminder (not directly testswarm related) mobile code is continueing to emit a lot of php errors and other stuff.
[11:07:23] <johnbender> X as a Service is great
[11:07:25] <uGoMobi> yeah so dev lead meeting notes
[11:07:31] <uGoMobi> they want you gseguin :)
[11:07:36] <Krinkle> I'd recommend you go over the logs in splunk and fix some of these bugs that are likely causing errors and you wouldn't even know why they're failing.
[11:07:38] <uGoMobi> s/so/saw/
[11:07:51] <johnbender> Krinkle: we're trying to get rid of php all together
[11:08:08] <johnbender> Krinkle: noted though
[11:08:09] <Krinkle> johnbender: well, the bugs are in the logic you wrote, not in php.
[11:08:15] <johnbender> ...
[11:08:23] <Krinkle> I mean, it'd be the same in nodejs
[11:08:47] <johnbender> except we'll be discarding the php shortly so it'd be a waste ._.
[11:09:04] <johnbender> Krinkle: is it flooding the logs?
[11:09:05] <Krinkle> either way, if you're wondering why certain tests fail... here's why.
[11:09:26] <Krinkle> johnbender: I've blacklisted most of mobile because I can't fix it and you're not caring.
[11:09:27] <johnbender> Krinkle: which tests?
[11:09:42] <Krinkle> I don't know to what actual tests they correlate, I only see the http requests
[11:09:48] <gseguin> Krinkle: can you send me a pointer to the splunk logs?
[11:09:52] <Krinkle> so it doesn't flood the visible logs.
[11:09:58] <Krinkle> will do
[11:10:03] <gseguin> Krinkle: we'll look at it
[11:10:04] <johnbender> Krinkle: this is the first time I've heard about it ... "not caring" isn't quite fair
[11:10:28] <Krinkle> johnbender: okay, I might have been under an illusion
[11:10:44] <Krinkle> I feel like I encounter new ones every few days and I fixed a few a few months back
[11:10:44] <arschmitz> we have tests that intentionally request pages that dont exist could this be causing that?
[11:10:54] <johnbender> Krinkle: ^
[11:10:59] <Krinkle> No, that should be fine
[11:11:06] <Krinkle> they'd be catched by nginx before it goes to php.
[11:11:51] <johnbender> alright then
[11:11:58] <johnbender> uGoMobi: why don't you go
[11:12:04] <arschmitz> what sort of php errors are they?
[11:12:05] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:12:10] <johnbender> arschmitz: can we do this in dev?
[11:12:11] <Krinkle> johnbender: they are the type of errors I suspect will make things fail, and also show up in your own logs. by not caring I meant the fact that theyre still there. so either it doesn't affect you (in which case they're false positives) or it does but its not a priority.
[11:12:14] <johnbender> Krinkle: ^
[11:12:16] <uGoMobi> not much from me
[11:12:18] <johnbender> can we take the discussion to dev/
[11:12:19] <arschmitz> yeah sorry no prob
[11:12:19] <johnbender> ?
[11:12:30] <uGoMobi> have been looking into things we discussed for 1.4
[11:12:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For example: file_get_contents(../LICENSE-INFO.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory
[11:12:44] <uGoMobi> going to crank on triage soon
[11:12:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's all I can see in my Apache error_log
[11:12:57] <uGoMobi> and do some bug fixing
[11:13:01] * Krinkle pulls up logs without filter
[11:13:35] <uGoMobi> FYI - going to do JQM talk and workshop and Dutch Mobile Conference in June
[11:13:47] <uGoMobi> that's it for me
[11:13:52] <Krinkle> I'll ping you guys later in #jquerymobile-dev
[11:14:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: nice!
[11:14:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: ??
[11:14:21] <johnbender> you're up
[11:14:48] <arschmitz> not really much here been looking into a few things for 1.4 but havent actually done much
[11:14:57] <gseguin> Krinkle: sounds good
[11:15:29] <uGoMobi> teaching JavaScript to your son already arschmitz ?
[11:15:33] <uGoMobi> ;-)
[11:15:44] <arschmitz> ha ha
[11:15:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: arschmitz: sweet God please start with something else (half joking)
[11:16:07] <johnbender> agcolom: you want to go?
[11:16:10] <arschmitz> yeah ill start reading him books on js instead of storeies
[11:16:14] <agcolom> ok,
[11:16:46] <agcolom> really been recovering from Vienna conf... so only minor changes/fixes to the api docs and a bit of triage...
[11:17:17] <agcolom> I have big work things for one more week... will have more time after the 15th
[11:17:25] <johnbender> agcolom: cool
[11:17:31] <agcolom> that's it
[11:17:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you think demos and docs issues in two diff repos is too confusing?
[11:18:18] <johnbender> am I missing anyone else before we discuss the registry?
[11:18:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I'm not sure... May be confusing for users...
[11:18:34] <agcolom> (not confusing for us ;-) )
[11:18:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes that's what I mean
[11:18:44] <agcolom> maybe we can educate users
[11:19:21] <agcolom> and have a clear statement somewhere? (readme/contribute on github for the api docs?
[11:19:33] <uGoMobi> yeah, was thinking the same
[11:19:51] <agcolom> ok, maybe we can discuss this on dev?
[11:19:56] <johnbender> gseguin: oh that reminds me I said I would update the readme o.o
[11:19:59] <uGoMobi> or maybe it's just now and people get used soon
[11:20:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you want to go?
[11:20:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah
[11:20:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sure.
[11:20:14] <gseguin> johnbender: that's right
[11:20:20] <agcolom> (not this evening though, I still need to finish my lecture slides for tomorrow!)
[11:20:22] <_|Nix|_> Merged some performance PRs.
[11:20:33] <gseguin> johnbender: I can help there but I've got to handle a shitstorm at work first
[11:20:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: were you able to test them at all?
[11:20:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we can look at it some other time
[11:20:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: or was it a pretty clear win?
[11:20:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep. Got jsperf links on all of them.
[11:20:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: fucking win
[11:21:08] <_|Nix|_> Discovered to my amazement that Webkit intenitonally doesn't create history entries until after the first (spurious?) popstate unwinds!
[11:21:13] <johnbender> gseguin: no worries I can get off my ass
[11:21:17] <_|Nix|_> ... while looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5733
[11:21:17] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5733 by mrextreme (2d 9h ago): Closing a popup does back twice on WebKit-based browsers
[11:21:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ewww
[11:21:30] <_|Nix|_> Yeah :/
[11:21:38] <_|Nix|_> ... and then I worked on the registry ...
[11:21:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The jsperf links are either in the issue comment or the commit message.
[11:22:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ did i see in jQuery Dev they are saying thats intentional on part of webkit?
[11:22:26] <arschmitz> ah sorry
[11:22:31] <arschmitz> missed right above link lol
[11:22:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep mkwst in #jquery-dev was saying that - and he's on the Google Chrome team.
[11:22:54] * johnbender shrugs
[11:22:55] <b-ot> johnbender: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:22:59] <johnbender> this is the web
[11:22:59] <arschmitz> crazy!
[11:23:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Insanity^2
[11:23:24] <_|Nix|_> Anyhoo ... that's it from my end.
[11:23:30] <johnbender> anyone else?
[11:23:44] <johnbender> Mine is short
[11:23:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The perf wins were fairly evident.
[11:24:01] <_|Nix|_> Sorry!
[11:24:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no worries
[11:24:22] <johnbender> helped out gseguin a bit
[11:24:33] <johnbender> cataloging all the core methods called in our test suite
[11:24:41] <johnbender> yay for 20 lines of js and a bash one liner
[11:24:58] <johnbender> cataloguing*
[11:25:10] <johnbender> still need to map that to the core modules
[11:25:15] <johnbender> (the hard part)
[11:25:21] <johnbender> and then the registry thing yesterday
[11:25:53] <johnbender> Anyone from the community have questions? Comments?
[11:25:58] <johnbender> Complaints?
[11:26:03] <_|Nix|_> Lamentations?
[11:26:26] <johnbender> alright
[11:26:38] <johnbender> does everyone from the team have time to discuss the registry bit?
[11:26:46] <johnbender> we'll switch to dev for that
[11:26:53] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:26:53] <_|Nix|_> OK. Can do.
[11:26:54] <johnbender> just checking since you're all here
[11:26:57] <johnbender> kk
[11:26:57] <arschmitz> sure
[11:26:58] <johnbender> thanks all!
[13:31:56] <jzaefferer> gseguin: regarding Travis - have you ported any jobs that use TestSwarm from Jenkins Travis?
