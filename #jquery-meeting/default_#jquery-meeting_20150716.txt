[09:00:35] <arschmitz> hi
[09:00:48] <jdalton> yay
[09:00:48] <b-ot> jdalton: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:01:03] <jdalton> wat
[09:01:13] <jdalton> b-ot you let me down
[09:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> jdalton: Have you been working on automating individual tests?
[09:03:12] <jdalton> Ya I got that bit worked out, just need to finish going through them.
[09:03:25] <jdalton> also the odd travis-ci fails
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, our unit tests don't pass.
[09:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> We inherited failing tests, but we wanted to see what the coverage was like with the W3C tests.
[09:04:55] <jdalton> oh this was on the automated side
[09:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> Some of the unit tests seem whacky, so I think many of them will go away in favor of functional tests.
[09:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[09:05:31] <jdalton> ya I noticed some issues with the functional ones too but just skipping them and will revisit (may require a PR on the w3c repo)
[09:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:06:15] <jdalton> to automate I'm using a combo of snovers chrome extension and a cleanup pass but got it to work locally which is win
[09:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> It'd probably be good to send PRs in batches, maybe 10 tests at a time?
[09:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> Just to keep the reviews manageable.
[09:06:51] <jdalton> ya once I get them all converted I'll see what we have to push up to them
[09:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> I meant for PEP.
[09:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> So we don't get a PR at the end of your work with dozens of tests files to review.
[09:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> Since each one will be reviewed independently anyway.
[09:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> We can review and land them incrementally as you automated them.
[09:08:22] <jdalton> oh ya ok
[09:10:20] <arschmitz> +1 would be nice to see some up and running
[09:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> We're still waiting for Stefan to update the PR for the new W3C test: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1949
[09:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> No Jacob today, huh?
[09:13:21] <jdalton> I donno
[09:13:32] <jdalton> I guess I could walk like 15 feet
[09:13:34] <jdalton> one second
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:13:51] <arschmitz> lol
[09:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi1: Once the W3C test lands and we import and update it, https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/168 is good to land?
[09:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> I believe https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/168#discussion_r32285964 was the only thing that came out of your review.
[09:14:38] <jdalton> he;s here
[09:14:40] <jrossi1> Yes
[09:14:49] <jdalton> yay!
[09:14:55] <jrossi1> (sorry i got in late today)
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> Any update on touch-action?
[09:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi1, arschmitz ^
[09:18:13] <arschmitz> im waiting on jrossi1
[09:19:29] <arschmitz> a few meetings ago he agreed to set up meeting with the person he knew
[09:20:35] * jrossi1 bangs head against desk for forgetting
[09:20:48] <jrossi1> I'm on it. I'll set up a chat today.
[09:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for us to discuss today?
[09:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not.
[09:26:13] <jdalton> jq 3.0
[09:26:15] <jdalton> woooo
[09:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:26:23] <jdalton> modules modules modules
[09:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in #pep.
[09:26:53] <jdalton> : D
[09:26:55] <jrossi1> archmitz: i sent a mail to get the conversation started
[09:27:22] <jrossi1> s/archmitz/arschmitz
[09:27:35] <arschmitz> jrossi1: just got it thank you!
[11:04:18] <arschmitz> agcolom: apsdehal: gabrielschulhof: cgack: jasperdegroot: sfrisk: Meeting Time
[11:04:34] <apsdehal> HI
[11:04:45] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[11:04:49] <sfrisk> Allo!
[11:05:01] <cgack> howdy
[11:05:09] <jasperdegroot> hello
[11:05:38] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=849521519
[11:05:41] <arschmitz> agenda ^^
[11:07:04] <arschmitz> So big news this week is page and popup
[11:07:19] <arschmitz> just doing some final testing on various devices and i think they are good to land
[11:07:40] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i plan to finish tonight
[11:07:53] <arschmitz> so if your around can get them landed tomorrow
[11:08:18] <jasperdegroot> great
[11:08:36] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i had started going over your PR then you updated it :-)
[11:08:41] <arschmitz> so i will start over
[11:08:49] <jasperdegroot> aww sorry
[11:08:51] <gabrielschulhof> \o/
[11:09:01] <arschmitz> its ok i was just going through the demo pages
[11:09:06] <arschmitz> nothing big
[11:09:23] <jasperdegroot> I just noticed some small things that I missed
[11:09:29] <gabrielschulhof> It'll be good to have them off my shoulders.
[11:09:43] <jasperdegroot> so I rebased to add the changes to existing commits
[11:09:58] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats absolutely fine
[11:10:06] <arschmitz> id rather you fix it :-)
[11:10:14] <jasperdegroot> should have warned you
[11:10:23] <arschmitz> dont worry about it
[11:10:30] <gabrielschulhof> This can be handled with assignment, you know ...
[11:10:47] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:10:50] <gabrielschulhof> When you intend on making changes, assign yourself and add the label that it needs modification.
[11:10:59] <arschmitz> so in other demo new sfrisk got the promised 3rd party stuff in a PR
[11:11:09] <jasperdegroot> although you might miss the change in assignment
[11:11:15] <gabrielschulhof> Of course this does not work if both of you check in close proximity.
[11:11:29] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Right.
[11:11:36] <jasperdegroot> a warning in IRC probably works better
[11:11:37] <arschmitz> unless there was any additional feed back on that ill pull in sfrisk changes and land that on 1.5
[11:12:04] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I only noticed some missing tabs in the CSS of sfrisk her PR
[11:12:15] <sfrisk> I think the only issue so far was I accidentally used spaces, and I fixed that this morning
[11:12:15] <arschmitz> she fixed
[11:12:16] <jasperdegroot> but maybe that has already been fixed
[11:12:19] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:12:29] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:12:39] <sfrisk> Newer computer, forgot to have to force to have white space characters to appear
[11:13:13] <agcolom> hi, sorry a bit late...
[11:13:58] <arschmitz> no problem
[11:14:05] <sfrisk> It happens
[11:14:10] <arschmitz> be prepared for that from me when i get my new one next week lol
[11:15:05] <gabrielschulhof> Back up your dotfiles, ppl.
[11:15:09] <arschmitz> sfrisk: also submitted a pr for accordion
[11:15:24] <sfrisk> I accomplished stuff last night!
[11:15:28] <sfrisk> It was exciting
[11:15:32] <gabrielschulhof> I keep my text editor configuration in a git repo.
[11:15:39] <sfrisk> I need to start doing that
[11:16:08] <arschmitz> dont all our repos have editor configs?]
[11:16:17] <sfrisk> ... possibly
[11:16:28] <arschmitz> no mobile does not
[11:16:29] <arschmitz> odd
[11:16:38] <arschmitz> we should add that porbably
[11:16:51] <sfrisk> I know I should have checked the style last night, I'm blaming the fact that by the time I was finishing up the 3rd party it was 11:45 at I was sleepy.
[11:16:54] <arschmitz> i thought we had one
[11:17:22] <sfrisk> and I*
[11:17:32] <sfrisk> So, create an issue, we'll add it
[11:18:46] <arschmitz> dont
[11:18:48] <arschmitz> done
[11:21:41] <arschmitz> so UI is getting ready to land a breakup of their core file into individual modules
[11:21:58] <arschmitz> su we will need to update anything using anything from ui core
[11:22:06] <arschmitz> I started going through and doing this
[11:22:20] <arschmitz> will submit a PR for it once the one in UI lands so that i can test it
[11:22:36] <arschmitz> they are also re organuizing their JS file structure
[11:22:47] <arschmitz> so we will have to update all our dependencies to match
[11:23:11] <arschmitz> their widgets will now be in a widgets folder like ours
[11:23:30] <arschmitz> its a small change but it kinda ripples
[11:24:52] <jasperdegroot> maybe we want to do the remaining things from this ticket at the same time? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5982
[11:25:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i was thinking about that as well
[11:25:58] <jasperdegroot> ticket is old, not sure if everything in there is still applicable
[11:26:11] <gabrielschulhof> Well, that's part of using UI's DB.
[11:26:12] <arschmitz> yeah well do what ever is that we care about and call it good and close it
[11:26:33] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes it ties into that too
[11:26:33] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:26:47] <arschmitz> i was kinda thinking we should go with a flatter structure
[11:27:01] <arschmitz> like js/core stuff
[11:27:04] <arschmitz> js/navigation
[11:27:07] <arschmitz> js/widgets
[11:27:16] <arschmitz> and no folders inside thoes
[11:28:09] <gabrielschulhof> That's actually not much, right? Just transitions/visuals and widgets/forms
[11:28:10] <jasperdegroot> sounds good to me
[11:28:24] <arschmitz> i think so
[11:28:51] <arschmitz> so just simplify a little
[11:28:58] <arschmitz> also move enhancer out of widgets
[11:29:09] <arschmitz> since its not dependent on widget.js any more
[11:29:12] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that makes sense in the root.
[11:29:23] <arschmitz> well it was originally widget specific
[11:29:30] <arschmitz> but its not any more
[11:30:44] <arschmitz> ok so ill incorperate the re-org into the core break up just like i did for ui
[11:30:57] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[11:31:08] <arschmitz> ok so enhancer
[11:31:18] <arschmitz> that PR is waiting on review
[11:32:19] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll have a look.
[11:32:26] <arschmitz> cgack: any updates on toolbar or rangeslider backcompat
[11:33:12] <cgack> no, i hope to get some work done tomorrow on it. Also gabrielschulhof pointed out that slider is missing ui-slider-bg so that will be another PR for 1.5 when i get to it, unless it has already been addressed
[11:33:23] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: I fixed that.
[11:33:29] <cgack> gabrielschulhof: thanks!
[11:33:33] <gabrielschulhof> cgack: It was super minor.
[11:33:42] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:33:51] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: your working on listview now right?
[11:33:52] <cgack> still should be helpfull before i hit rangeslider backcompat with the highlight issues
[11:34:00] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Boy, am I ever.
[11:34:09] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:34:15] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: It's a can of worms.
[11:34:22] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: are you incorperating https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7162
[11:34:24] <gabrielschulhof> I shudder to think about panel and table.
[11:34:27] <arschmitz> and other review ithem stuff
[11:34:33] <arschmitz> oh wait we talked about that one already
[11:34:38] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that's in there.
[11:35:08] <gabrielschulhof> Though, like I said, not much left. Still, we can't squash that because it's a genuine new feature.
[11:35:12] <arschmitz> yup
[11:35:31] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: what about other reiviw stuff like options
[11:35:34] <arschmitz> at run time
[11:35:40] <arschmitz> .on
[11:35:44] <arschmitz> etc
[11:35:45] <gabrielschulhof> All part of this PR.
[11:35:48] <arschmitz> awesome!
[11:36:00] <arschmitz> I consider listview key for us
[11:36:06] <arschmitz> one of our most popular widgets
[11:36:12] <jasperdegroot> yeah it's pretty popular
[11:36:27] <gabrielschulhof> I have a checklist:
[11:36:31] <gabrielschulhof> [ ] Use theme extension
[11:36:31] <gabrielschulhof> [ ] _(add|remove|toggle)Class
[11:36:31] <gabrielschulhof> [ ] deepEqual -> strictEqual
[11:36:31] <gabrielschulhof> [ ] hasClasses
[11:36:31] <gabrielschulhof> [ ] style options go into .deprecated.js
[11:36:34] <gabrielschulhof> [ ] tests for deprecated style options
[11:36:51] <gabrielschulhof> [ ] this._on()
[11:37:09] <gabrielschulhof> ... which is why we need to keep a close eye on perf.
[11:37:18] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, BTW, listview.
[11:37:28] <gabrielschulhof> Do we need to add class ui-listview-item to each item?
[11:37:39] <jasperdegroot> I think we do
[11:37:46] <arschmitz> in theory yes
[11:37:51] <gabrielschulhof> I'm currently doing it just so we have class keys for everything, but we didn't use to do that in 1.4.
[11:37:58] <arschmitz> but if there was a strong provable perf case we could discuss it
[11:38:03] <gabrielschulhof> I don't wanna thrash the DOM more than I need to.
[11:38:17] <gabrielschulhof> I'll do some tests now that jsperf is back.
[11:38:18] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: if it has no styles applied to it it should not repaint or do anything
[11:38:22] <jasperdegroot> I also remember that adding a class like that to the list items again was the solution for an open issue
[11:38:26] <arschmitz> *SHOULD*
[11:38:44] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: OK, in that case it stays.
[11:39:00] <gabrielschulhof> ... until perf says otherwise (which may be never).
[11:39:06] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: perf is a real concern in the past on listview so we want to check to make sure
[11:39:16] <gabrielschulhof> I also wanna compare against 1.4.
[11:39:29] <gabrielschulhof> I'm planning a really huge jsperf :)
[11:39:30] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6680
[11:40:14] <jasperdegroot> that ticket has milestone 1.6 btw
[11:40:20] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, wait a sec ... that may already have been fixed.
[11:40:24] <gabrielschulhof> Like, in 1.4
[11:40:31] <gabrielschulhof> We had ui-li-static and ui-li-divider.
[11:40:45] <gabrielschulhof> ... and in refresh() we skip items that already have that class.
[11:40:49] <gabrielschulhof> those classes.
[11:41:21] <jasperdegroot> but actually I was thinking about this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7670#issuecomment-55835734
[11:41:41] <gabrielschulhof> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.js look for ui-li-static
[11:41:55] <gabrielschulhof> So we can close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6680
[11:42:37] <arschmitz> woo
[11:42:41] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[11:43:15] <arschmitz> cgack: after toolbar you just have navbar right/
[11:44:11] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll make sure to mark https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7670 as fixed in the classes PR
[11:44:26] <arschmitz> and gabrielschulhof you have listview, selectmenu, and loader
[11:44:41] <arschmitz> and i think that is all of them
[11:45:01] <arschmitz> oh wait no panel :-/
[11:45:25] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. Quite a lineup, eh?
[11:45:33] <gabrielschulhof> ... and table.
[11:45:38] <arschmitz> right
[11:45:55] <gabrielschulhof> I'd done a review on table before the classes option surfaced, so I need to start from there.
[11:45:58] <arschmitz> well i think the rest though challenging should be smoother
[11:46:00] <jasperdegroot> about the helper classes to make icons float... we discussed the name last week and came up with ui-widget-icon-flushbeginning/end, but doesn't ui-widget-icon-floatbeginning/end make more sense?
[11:46:22] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: WFM
[11:46:30] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll rename.
[11:46:33] <cgack> @arschmitz i think so, toolbar then navbar
[11:46:41] <jasperdegroot> WFM?
[11:46:52] <arschmitz> works for me
[11:46:55] <jasperdegroot> works for me
[11:46:58] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:47:08] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:47:36] <jasperdegroot> I'll make a PR for the CSS for that
[11:47:48] <arschmitz> last thing
[11:48:04] <arschmitz> apsdehal: the test updates from apsdehal look good
[11:48:18] <arschmitz> im going to land those and let him get to work on more modules
[11:48:45] <gabrielschulhof> Is that the webdriver stuff?
[11:48:50] <arschmitz> not yet
[11:48:55] <arschmitz> this is just updating to not use globals
[11:49:06] <agcolom> regarding the helper classes, this shou;d be in the notes
[11:49:07] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, like QUnit.test and stuff?
[11:49:07] <arschmitz> so test->QUnit.test
[11:49:13] <gabrielschulhof> Gotcha.
[11:49:23] <agcolom> should it be in a new category or one of the existing ones?
[11:49:32] <arschmitz> new
[11:49:42] <gabrielschulhof> We should also asyncTest() -> test( ) + var done = assert.async()
[11:50:22] <arschmitz> we can worry about that later
[11:50:27] <arschmitz> this is being done automated
[11:50:36] <arschmitz> its a step towards intern
[11:50:38] <gabrielschulhof> Well, I'm doing it for all my new asyncTests().
[11:50:47] <arschmitz> ok
[11:50:52] <gabrielschulhof> Very nice!
[11:51:03] <arschmitz> the intern interface does not expose globals
[11:51:08] <gabrielschulhof> I can't wait to have the kind of multiplatform testing that UI gets.
[11:51:20] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: here is the ticket if you need it for the notes... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8145
[11:51:24] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: and real functional tests
[11:51:31] <agcolom> jasperdegroot: thanks!
[11:51:34] <arschmitz> with real browser events and real navigation
[11:52:21] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: also means dropping ie8 YAY
[11:52:30] <arschmitz> we get to do all the fun stuff after 1.5
[11:52:39] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[11:53:00] <gabrielschulhof> Speaking of IE8 ... did you device test popup on that as well?
[11:53:10] <gabrielschulhof> I'm a bit worried about the arrow.
[11:53:13] <arschmitz> i have not done ie8 on either yet
[11:53:18] <gabrielschulhof> That's always giving me trouble on IE.
[11:53:29] <gabrielschulhof> Like black squares instead of the neat triangle and stuff.
[11:53:46] <arschmitz> ie8 is just not made for that type of manipulation
[11:53:48] <jasperdegroot> I wouldn't worry too much about it
[11:54:05] <arschmitz> i have little concern for ie8 other then functionality
[11:54:09] <jasperdegroot> if you use IE8 you probably are used to things like that
[11:54:10] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[11:54:23] <arschmitz> we have never enforced perfection we have always embraced progressive enhancment
[11:54:29] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... it's like reading in the dark. Sooner or later you break your eyes.
[11:54:33] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:55:09] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thought
[11:55:22] <arschmitz> could we have a single float class by using :first :last?
[11:55:31] <arschmitz> no need for beginning / end
[11:55:39] <arschmitz> similar to how the block one does top bottom
[11:56:12] <jasperdegroot> hmm
[11:56:33] <gabrielschulhof> Remember that it may be the first visible, but not first in the DOM ... riiight? *scratch head*
[11:56:34] <jasperdegroot> I don't think so
[11:56:38] <arschmitz> if so that would be awesome sauce lol
[11:57:08] <jasperdegroot> but let me give it a look first
[11:57:09] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no in this case the icon should always be first last in dom if its getting floated
[11:57:18] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: this is with IE8 support?
[11:57:23] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[11:57:27] <arschmitz> oh right hmm
[11:57:53] <jasperdegroot> doesn't support :last-child
[11:58:10] <gabrielschulhof> Gah ...
[11:58:44] <jasperdegroot> one thing I could look into is using + in the selector
[11:58:59] <jasperdegroot> at the left the icon comes before the space span
[11:59:06] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok well if you can make it work i think it would be nice
[11:59:10] <jasperdegroot> at the right it's other way around
[11:59:26] <jasperdegroot> ok I will try that first before making two classes
[11:59:48] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: though also to considder is css only where you dont need the space span
[11:59:51] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: I guess changing the class name again in listview isn't much trouble
[12:00:27] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: No. It only appears in one place.
[12:00:36] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: actually I added some padding to the space span in my PR
[12:00:56] <jasperdegroot> because there was not that much space between text an icon
[12:01:15] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah we had talked about that on ui
[12:01:37] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but if possible we shoud adjust the icon not the space
[12:01:46] <arschmitz> since the space should not be required when doing css only
[12:01:57] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:02:20] <jasperdegroot> in that case I will have to revert that commit
[12:02:42] <arschmitz> could you just add some margin to the icon instead?
[12:03:02] <jasperdegroot> yes sure
[12:03:08] <arschmitz> cool
[12:03:29] <arschmitz> then it should work either way
[12:03:41] <arschmitz> ok so last 2 things real quick
[12:03:46] <arschmitz> git failures soom to be all better
[12:03:57] <arschmitz> so now only failing tests on 1.5 are the rangslider ones
[12:04:00] <arschmitz> yay
[12:04:14] <arschmitz> and jasperdegroot found a bug in the backcompat im fixing
[12:04:30] <arschmitz> so if a backcompat option is not being applied in something thats probably why
[12:05:07] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, wow, really? Got a link?
[12:05:49] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/js/widgets/widget.backcompat.js#L100
[12:06:09] <arschmitz> that typeof check on original will fail if the classes prop is undefined
[12:06:16] <arschmitz> but that does not mean its not a valid prop
[12:07:07] <arschmitz> i feel like i fixed this already and landed it but it must have been another branch of the logic doing basicly the same thing
[12:07:11] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, yeah, you're derefing two levels deep in one step.
[12:07:48] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: when this was written it was a valid assumoption
[12:08:00] <arschmitz> we used to enforce everything be defined even if its as null or ""
[12:08:08] <arschmitz> we changed that in the course of classes
[12:08:18] <gabrielschulhof> Wait though. That's fine.
[12:08:28] <gabrielschulhof> This only fails if classes is undefined.
[12:08:40] <arschmitz> right but for example
[12:08:45] <arschmitz> ui-controlgroup is undefined
[12:08:52] <arschmitz> but its a valid prop you could be setting
[12:09:21] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec, if you have no class keys, you still need to define the classes option as {}, right?
[12:09:31] <gabrielschulhof> Like options: { classes: {}, ... }?
[12:09:34] <arschmitz> yes but thats checking a specific prop
[12:09:37] <arschmitz> and no
[12:09:42] <arschmitz> the widget factory does that
[12:09:51] <arschmitz> all widgets have the classes option
[12:10:02] <arschmitz> even if they dont define it
[12:10:18] <gabrielschulhof> OKOK, but for typeof thatOneClassKey !== "string" is fine.
[12:10:18] <arschmitz> the issue is not classes being undefined
[12:10:27] <arschmitz> no
[12:10:53] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I understand now.
[12:11:08] <arschmitz> ok
[12:11:11] <gabrielschulhof> Just because it's undefined in the proto does not mean it does not need to be defined in the instance.
[12:11:30] <gabrielschulhof> It may need to be, if a style option needs to cause it to become defined.
[12:11:37] <arschmitz> right
[12:11:42] <gabrielschulhof> I see the bug now.
[12:11:49] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Good catch!
[12:11:52] <arschmitz> so just need to remove that first check entirely
[12:12:17] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: I just noticed it didn't work, arschmitz found the cause :)
[12:12:22] <arschmitz> only check the thing to be set not the thing we are setting
[12:12:50] <arschmitz> so thats all i have for today
[12:12:50] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, OK.
[12:12:55] <gabrielschulhof> Cool!
[12:13:13] <arschmitz> anyone have anything else?
[12:13:23] <gabrielschulhof> I'm good.
[12:13:33] <arschmitz> ok thanks everyone
[12:13:38] <jasperdegroot> later
[12:13:41] <gabrielschulhof> L8R
[12:13:42] <arschmitz> we are continuing to make awesome progress the last few weeks
[12:13:49] <arschmitz> lets keep it up and get 1.5 out
[12:13:57] <gabrielschulhof> :+1:
[12:16:14] <arschmitz> see everyone back in -dev
