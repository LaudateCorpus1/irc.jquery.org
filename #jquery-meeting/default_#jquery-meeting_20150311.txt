[08:57:40] <b-ot> jzaefferer: arschmitz jzaefferer fnagel mikesherov rxaviers rxaviers_ scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll tj_vantoll1
[08:57:55] <jzaefferer> uh, a bit early I guess
[08:58:01] <jzaefferer> have to fix that watch :/
[08:58:14] <fnagel> hey
[08:58:47] <jzaefferer> let's wait until the full hour...
[09:00:05] <arthurvr> ‘Allo!
[09:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> Now we can start :-)
[09:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket count is still dropping :-)
[09:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> Got a few new PRs this week. I reviewed most of them, and there were some updates after that.
[09:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll be getting back to those.
[09:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: Have all your comments/concerns been addressed for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1478 ?
[09:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to land that and the other PR that inspired it.
[09:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> For classes option, arschmitz pushed another update last night.
[09:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be reviewing that after the meeting.
[09:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully this will be the last round.
[09:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can start on button reviews ;-)
[09:04:03] <arschmitz> yay
[09:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> Selectmenu default width was updated. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1467
[09:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> And we just released 1.11.4 http://blog.jqueryui.com/2015/03/jquery-ui-1-11-4/
[09:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> There was a draggable bug that caused a bug in the WordPress admin panel.
[09:05:10] <scott_gonzalez> 1.11.4 was released to fix that.
[09:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> But there were a decent number of other fixes that were able to get in as well.
[09:05:37] <arschmitz> cool
[09:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Anything to discuss regarding GSoC?
[09:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not.
[09:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:12:00] <arschmitz> well that was quick
[09:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that was a quick meeting.
[09:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> More time for classes review :-P
[10:01:46] <arthurvr> Meeting time :)
[10:01:47] <agcolom> Thanks Alex!
[10:01:52] <arthurvr> `contentteam
[10:01:52] <b-ot> arthurvr: agcolom arschmitz arthurvr AurelioDeRosa danheberden gnarf kswedberg RWhitbeck scott_gonzalez sfrisk
[10:01:56] <arschmitz> agcolom: your welcome
[10:01:59] <sfrisk> bonjour!
[10:02:15] <agcolom> hello :-) Bonjour!
[10:02:29] <agcolom> I'm a bit behind with the agenda...
[10:02:33] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:02:36] <sfrisk> Blame daylight savings?
[10:02:43] <agcolom> absolutely!
[10:05:08] <arschmitz> its always day light savings fault
[10:05:24] <arthurvr> Sure it is :D
[10:05:43] <agcolom> ok, let's get started
[10:05:49] <agcolom> Ticket Triage: 245 (issues + PR) (-7)
[10:05:51] <agcolom> yay!
[10:06:03] <agcolom> jQuery UK went well also!
[10:06:03] <arthurvr> Yay
[10:06:19] <sfrisk> oo yay!
[10:06:27] <agcolom> so I'll be getting more time now (once I'm over this cough/cold)
[10:06:38] <sfrisk> Conference Crud?
[10:07:20] <agcolom> I think it's when you start relaxing, I fall ill!
[10:08:01] <agcolom> on a side note, I went to Facebook London last night for some talks on ReactJS and ReactNative.
[10:08:24] <agcolom> ReactNative looked quite good... Shame it's not out yet.
[10:09:00] <agcolom> Genesis script:
[10:09:00] <agcolom> will clone build and deploy all websites
[10:09:00] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/346
[10:09:28] <agcolom> arschmitz: did you want to say something about this?
[10:09:44] <arschmitz> sure
[10:09:54] <arschmitz> its just something i use to update all the sites at once
[10:10:06] <arschmitz> it will also clone and deploy all the sites at once if you dont have them
[10:10:46] <arschmitz> i had mentioned to agcolom earlier and she was interested in it so i did a pr to see if any one else was
[10:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> When do you need to update all the sites at once?
[10:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still trying to grasp the actual scenarios where you'd want this.
[10:11:40] <scott_gonzalez> I assume by update you mean pull and deploy.
[10:11:45] <arschmitz> correct
[10:11:57] <arschmitz> and i use it when im going to be making changes to a bunch of sites
[10:12:07] <arschmitz> and just want to make everything is up to date before i start
[10:12:09] <agcolom> I'd say it's not frequent. but it would have been useful for the change of copyright notice
[10:12:14] <agcolom> for example
[10:12:29] <arschmitz> i also used it to set up every site initially
[10:12:42] <arschmitz> rather then clone and set up the config for them one at a time
[10:13:23] <arthurvr> I needed it to test https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/332 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/331. I agree it’s useful but the audience seems rather small.
[10:13:23] <arschmitz> im the first to admit its not something that i use often which is why i had not previously dont a pr but there are times where its useful i think
[10:13:47] <agcolom> would it be possible to have a list of sites and select whcih ones you want to update? (don't worry if the answer is no)
[10:14:01] <arschmitz> agcolom: sure
[10:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> Even more to manage ;-)
[10:14:42] <arthurvr> ^ My first thought as well :-)
[10:14:49] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you think it's better to be all or nothing?
[10:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's better to be nothing :-)
[10:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> `git pull` is not difficult.
[10:16:00] <agcolom> I'm not strongly opinionated one way or the other
[10:16:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: this is a bit more then that it checks out master does a hard reset of it removes the node_modules directory then does npm install and deploys
[10:16:32] <arschmitz> but either way makes no difference to me i already have it lol
[10:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so if you forget that you've done some unsaved work, you'll lose it.
[10:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> Even better.
[10:16:56] <arschmitz> on master yup other wise it will fail and skip that site
[10:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> At least running `git pull` manually you'll know.
[10:17:19] <arschmitz> but i could add a warning about that too
[10:17:37] <arschmitz> but the whole point is to make sure master is up to date on every site
[10:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> To what end?
[10:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> If you're going to actually do work on a repo, you have basically the same steps to follow anyway.
[10:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> cd to the individual repo, make the change, deploy, check, commit, push
[10:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> repeat 20 times
[10:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that removing `git pull` from that list provides much value.
[10:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> The use case that arthurvr brought up is better, but extremely rare.
[10:20:45] <agcolom> ok, so scott_gonzalez do you think it's better not to have it because of the added maintenance, and risk to lose unsaved work in master?
[10:21:12] <agcolom> and small usecase/audience?
[10:21:28] <arschmitz> like i said i use this myself for my own uses and find it useful. If others want it im happy to work on this pr otherwise ill close it.
[10:22:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ?
[10:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think this is something we should maintain.
[10:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> Also, it's not about losing unpushed commits on master, it's about losing uncommited work.
[10:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> That was my concern.
[10:22:54] <agcolom> yes, that was what I meant
[10:23:02] <arschmitz> that is simple to address it can either not do a hard reset or warn
[10:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> My bigger concern is just maintainence and explaining when you should and shouldn't use this.
[10:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> And why we have this + vagrant.
[10:23:22] <arschmitz> how does this effect vagrant at all?
[10:23:31] <arschmitz> these all need to be setup to deploy to vagrant
[10:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, I was thinking vagrant had sites in it, but that just gets you jquery-wp-content + servers, huh?
[10:24:56] <arschmitz> yup
[10:25:07] <arschmitz> thats basicly just wordpress already spun up
[10:25:34] <arschmitz> this script actually makes our vagrant box actually work
[10:25:47] <arschmitz> with out manually cloning and depolying 25 sites one at a time
[10:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> Well, with massively more overhead than necessary for most.
[10:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> Very few people need 25 sites deployes.
[10:26:16] <jzaefferer> I can see quite a few improvements you could make for that script
[10:26:17] <arschmitz> true
[10:26:24] <jzaefferer> not sure if that makes it useful enough though
[10:26:26] <arschmitz> and it could be made to do select sites
[10:26:43] <arschmitz> right now its just what i spent 30 minutes writing to solve a problem i had
[10:28:17] <agcolom> right... we need to come to a consensus...
[10:28:52] <agcolom> should we leave it for next meeting to decide and continue the discussion on the PR on GH?
[10:29:06] <arthurvr> sgtm
[10:30:09] <agcolom> ok, updated the notes.
[10:30:22] <agcolom> Spider:
[10:30:22] <agcolom> Add spider task for checking website for issues
[10:30:22] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/364
[10:31:14] <arschmitz> i just didn't want to do a pr for every site it seems un-nessasarry so if people are happy with this one ( its super minor ) i'm just going to push the change to the rest of the sites
[10:31:43] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[10:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if `grunt spider` from any random dev should result in a full crawl of our stage and production sites.
[10:33:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so it would be better to have it done by one person and we all have access to the results?
[10:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> This makes me think we shouldn't have this in the Gruntfile for any of our sites.
[10:33:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: then you get people doing the same changes with no cordination
[10:33:52] <agcolom> ok
[10:34:05] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: what would you suggest if its not in some easy to do place no one will ever do it and nothing will get finished
[10:34:24] <jzaefferer> it could be a jenkins jobs that runs on some schedule or manually
[10:34:24] <agcolom> would it be best to do just stage?
[10:34:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we always planned to have it run on a cron
[10:34:58] <arschmitz> but right now there are thousands of errors so its pretty pointless
[10:35:00] <jzaefferer> jenkins makes that pretty easy and you get IRC notifications
[10:35:07] <jzaefferer> (if you want them)
[10:35:09] <arschmitz> i dont think there is a single site that is close to passing
[10:35:26] <jzaefferer> adding this to each site's gruntfile doesn't seem useful
[10:35:47] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the idea is then anyone can run the test and have a list of broken links to try to fix
[10:35:59] <arschmitz> its a task any random person can do no technical knowledge required
[10:36:19] <arschmitz> many are just typos or adding the s to https
[10:36:27] <arschmitz> missing trailing slashes
[10:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> But we shouldn't have any random person just crawling the entier site at random.
[10:36:50] <arschmitz> does it really hurt stage?
[10:37:02] <jzaefferer> could also do that based on output from jenkins, doesn't need to be local
[10:37:03] <arschmitz> production sure
[10:37:09] <jzaefferer> anyway, I got to go
[10:37:38] <arschmitz> this has no concurrency so its not going to overwhelm anything
[10:38:11] <arschmitz> and honestly there is little value to the production since it rare they are far out of sync
[10:38:45] <agcolom> ok, so if we decide to go ahead with this, we only do stage, not production, right?
[10:39:06] <arschmitz> i would say IF we added it i would do stage only yes
[10:39:48] <arschmitz> the ideal case would be to run against a local copy but that cant actually work
[10:39:58] <arschmitz> because you need every site setup local which is not possible
[10:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I just tried running this locally on api.jqueryui.com.
[10:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/ebf24a5285ab18b91d97
[10:41:23] <arschmitz> hm phantom is a dependency of casperjs which is a dependency of spider.js which is a dependency of grunt-spider
[10:41:32] <arschmitz> i know this worked for arthurvr
[10:41:38] <arschmitz> hes been using it
[10:41:43] <arthurvr> Sure it worked.
[10:42:23] <AurelioDeRosa> Oh....s**t. Are you people running the content meeting?
[10:42:34] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa: Yup. Daylight savings?
[10:42:47] <AurelioDeRosa> Oh...for God sake...
[10:43:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so no idea how you would get that warning from casperjs after an npm install https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/blob/master/package.json#L18
[10:43:31] <AurelioDeRosa> I thought I was the first
[10:43:34] <AurelioDeRosa> sorry about that
[10:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> I've got casperjs@1.1.0-beta3, phantomjs@1.9.16
[10:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well, casper is really git+https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs#7dece42de3119c3552fb64c8daa10e888cc56955
[10:44:44] <AurelioDeRosa> Anyone keen to provide a short summary?
[10:44:46] <arschmitz> well 1.9 sounds higher then 1.8 lol
[10:45:28] <agcolom> Aurelio, yes, notes at https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:45:36] <agcolom> we're only on 2nd item
[10:46:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: also those are the same versions i have
[10:46:50] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you Anne
[10:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> Are you sure it's not using the global phantomjs instead of the local phantomjs?
[10:49:16] <arschmitz> to be honest no baecause thats all part of casper i dont install or use phantom directly for this
[10:49:37] <arschmitz> so im not sure what casper is using ill have to look at their code or file an issue there
[10:49:46] <arthurvr> Maybe we should move this to the spider.js issue tracker?
[10:51:08] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/861
[10:53:55] <agcolom> ok, so is the decision that this issue needs more discussion/investigation and we defer the decision to the next meeting also?
[10:55:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz arthurvr ^?
[10:55:20] <arthurvr> seems good.
[10:55:27] <arschmitz> thats fine with me
[10:56:40] <agcolom> ok, thanks
[10:56:50] <agcolom> The other issues should be easy :-)
[10:57:50] <agcolom> I've received 2 requests to have access to trello from people interested in GSOC
[10:58:14] <arthurvr> IMHO, at the moment trello does not add many value
[10:58:31] <agcolom> however, I'm not sure that's terribly useful to them as I'm the only one using it and I use it to keep track of all the content-related issues I'm dealing with
[10:58:57] <agcolom> so I'd be inclined to remove this from the readme.
[10:59:04] <agcolom> nothing there isn't already on GH
[10:59:16] <arschmitz> +1
[10:59:18] <arthurvr> Yeah +1 :D
[10:59:21] <agcolom> Cool!
[10:59:26] <AurelioDeRosa> Agree
[10:59:35] <agcolom> good
[10:59:57] <arthurvr> Shall I PR to remove that sentence?
[11:00:19] <agcolom> arthurvr: if you like. yes please
[11:00:33] <agcolom> check past messages and see if any contain private info, then, make mailing public
[11:00:33] <agcolom> Not done - ongoing
[11:01:07] <arthurvr> sh** accidentally commited it on master.
[11:01:10] <agcolom> So I'll try to have a look this week if anything is sensitive in the past messages
[11:01:16] * arthurvr hates github interface.
[11:01:23] <arthurvr> Shall I reset it?
[11:01:43] <agcolom> no,
[11:01:53] <agcolom> on content. it's ok I believe :-)
[11:02:14] <arthurvr> Okay then :D
[11:02:15] <agcolom> it's just the readme, not code per se :-)
[11:02:31] <arthurvr> Sorry again! :)
[11:02:31] <agcolom> thanks for the quick fix
[11:02:51] <agcolom> Anne to update matrix with details (mail sent/consent received)
[11:02:51] <agcolom> ongoing
[11:03:10] <agcolom> again, did not have anytime in the last 2 weeks. should be better now
[11:03:26] <agcolom> aim to have this comleted by next meeting
[11:03:33] <arthurvr> No worries :) SGTM
[11:03:38] <agcolom> Aurelio to see how we can get more help from the community
[11:03:38] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeiwEtiIitFt1X8Iu1Cu2X0GgwM-MSb4FOOl50oerPY/edit
[11:03:38] <agcolom> Looks good! A few comments need addressing and a final review from Karl would be great.
[11:03:51] <AurelioDeRosa> I made the final changes, so it should be ready.
[11:04:35] <agcolom> do you know if kswedberg did a final check?
[11:04:56] <AurelioDeRosa> I don't think so
[11:05:01] <agcolom> hey Karl :-)
[11:05:04] <kswedberg> hey agcolom , AurelioDeRosa
[11:05:10] <agcolom> (Karl is looking at it now :-) )
[11:05:28] <kswedberg> sorry, been sick. missed the first part of mtg
[11:05:35] <kswedberg> I can take a look now.
[11:05:36] <arthurvr> Hey Karl!
[11:05:56] <kswedberg> hey!
[11:06:02] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you Karl
[11:06:09] <agcolom> Thanks Karl!
[11:08:47] <AurelioDeRosa> Do we want to plan when to publish this post?
[11:08:58] <agcolom> yes, this is exactly what I was going to ask
[11:09:12] <AurelioDeRosa> Is there any process you usually follow?
[11:09:37] <agcolom> I need to check with scott_gonzalez and gnarf how best to do this.
[11:09:57] <AurelioDeRosa> IMO it can be published anytime we want also because we had this post drafted a few weeks ago
[11:10:24] <agcolom> because there is no content-related blog area I don't think
[11:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> We've generally just used blog.jquery.com in the past.
[11:12:03] <kswedberg> I have a question about the 2nd paragraph…it starts by talking about "work on the several jQuery-related websites," but then it says "you can help by fixing issues in the code or improving the documentation." Are you referring to issues with the websites' code? or, like, jQuery core? It seems the focus shifts a bit in there.
[11:12:31] <AurelioDeRosa> I think it'll be fine. We also thought about sharing it on Twitter (I don't know if it's the default behavior).
[11:13:05] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, and how best would it be to specify the author?
[11:13:17] <AurelioDeRosa> The general idea as I recall was to have help in any area.
[11:13:37] <agcolom> Can we add Aurelio as the Author?
[11:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[11:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get him added now.
[11:14:21] <kswedberg> ok... Looks good as is.
[11:14:39] <kswedberg> (I made one or two tiny edits)
[11:14:54] <agcolom> Thank you scott_gonzalez!
[11:15:28] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you Scott
[11:16:22] <agcolom> We tend to say that early in the week US time is best for posts
[11:17:36] <agcolom> So we could publish early next week... like monday, midday ET? That'd be 4pm in Europe and we can tweet again tuesday 10am GMT
[11:17:58] <arthurvr> Sounds good
[11:18:39] <agcolom> should we mention irc #jquery-content also?
[11:18:43] <AurelioDeRosa> Sounds good!
[11:18:50] <arthurvr> Yeah, why not
[11:19:24] <AurelioDeRosa> As I said, I think we're asking for help in any repo, so I don't think the content channel should be there.
[11:20:34] <agcolom> ok...
[11:21:13] <agcolom> any other issues/questions?
[11:21:57] <agcolom> ok, so I think this is it for today. Thanks everyone!
[11:22:03] <arthurvr> Bye guys!
[11:22:29] <agcolom> arschmitz: could you please close the channel? Thank you
[11:22:37] <arschmitz> yup
