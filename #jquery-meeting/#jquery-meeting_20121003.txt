[08:59:31] <jzaefferer> is this thing on?
[08:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> It is now
[09:00:07] <kborchers> heh
[09:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry for all the emails.
[09:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm about halfway done...
[09:00:24] <kborchers> good thing i have a filter for trac :)
[09:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf rxaviers
[09:03:22] * rxaviers here
[09:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's get started.
[09:05:27] <jzaefferer> no more opening of a really old sheet...
[09:05:41] <kborchers> jzaefferer: thank you sir!
[09:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> I moved the index page for api.jqueryui.com into the content repo.
[09:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> So now the 1.8 and 1.9 docs have different index pages.
[09:06:26] <jzaefferer> gnarf: around?
[09:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> nacin is working on a filter to rewrite URLs so that we can use api.jqueryui.com/1.8/ without having the include the "/1.8/" in all of the content links.
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Download Builder and ThemeRoller are done, correct?
[09:08:25] <rxaviers> All issues pointed so far have been fixed
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> I've been porting old changelogs to jqueryui.com.
[09:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> I've got quite a few done: http://stage.jqueryui.com/changelog/
[09:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> The 1.9.0 changelog will be finished as soon as we do the release.
[09:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which brings us to the next item...
[09:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know of ANYTHING that needs to happen before we tag 1.9.0?
[09:10:09] <jzaefferer> Nope
[09:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> If not, the plan is to tag 1.9.0 today.
[09:10:42] <kborchers> \o/
[09:10:56] <rxaviers> On DLB and TR, what I still need to complete is do a snif test with other browsers to see if everything is alright. But, I can do it in the next hours
[09:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: That should just be the generated HTML pages and JS/CSS resources, right?
[09:11:47] <rxaviers> I think (hope) we wont have surprises, because most of the html / css is from former code anyway
[09:11:58] <rxaviers> right
[09:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we're not ready to deploy the new sites yet anyway.
[09:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> So if you find something and fix it after I tag 1.9.0, that should be fine.
[09:12:33] <rxaviers> ah ok
[09:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> We need to get the 1.8 API site done first.
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> We need to deploy all the sites together.
[09:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> Tagging will allow us to notify the CDNs.
[09:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer did another dry run this morning with the release script and everything seemed good.
[09:14:12] <jzaefferer> yeah, and scott_gonzalez already worked through most of the changelogâ€¦ 2500 lines of crazyness seemed not much fun
[09:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that was quite tedious to work through.
[09:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that brings us to 1.10.
[09:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> Since 1.10 actually has a deadline and 1.9 is late, we're going to be in crunch mode again :-/
[09:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> The most important thing is to get dialog updated for Drupal 8.
[09:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> They have a feature freeze on December 1 and a code freeze on February 1.
[09:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> So we're aiming for a beta by December 1 and final by January 1.
[09:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> We do have 2 options for making this easier.
[09:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Cut scope on 1.10
[09:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Get the accessibility updates into a 1.9.x release.
[09:17:50] <jzaefferer> Speaking of, when do we start a 1-9-stable branch?
[09:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking we'll do that after 1.9.1.
[09:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> Since branching puts us in cherry-pick mode.
[09:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> So we can start a branch for the dialog API redesign now.
[09:19:05] <jzaefferer> okay, we've got the others in branches already anyway
[09:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> And then just merge that in to master after we branch for 1-9-stable.
[09:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, new plugins will just stay in their branches until after 1-9-stable exists.
[09:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's important for us not to merge new plugins until they're really ready though.
[09:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> Which is different from other releases.
[09:20:11] <jzaefferer> We could work on Dialog after the dev summit, we've got a few days together
[09:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> Just because we don't want to end up with a new plugin holding up 1.10 and screwing up the dialog release.
[09:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog will be my big focus at that point.
[09:21:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: how about progressbar? should i create a branch for that or work in master?
[09:21:17] <kborchers> planning on focusing on that unless you need me elsewhere
[09:21:19] <jzaefferer> How can we remove the bug triaging load from you?
[09:21:37] <jzaefferer> That is, for every new ticket that comes in, have someone else process that befoure you look at it.
[09:21:39] <jzaefferer> *before
[09:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that.
[09:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> Bug triage hasn't actually been too bad recently.
[09:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> Especially since I ignore interaction tickets :-P
[09:22:27] <jzaefferer> Well, it should get more interesting after the 1.9.0 release
[09:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> But help with triage would certainly be appreciated.
[09:22:47] <jzaefferer> I don't really want to get into that either
[09:23:40] <jzaefferer> Can we take over some core triagers? Just for the first response, checking if its valid and stuff
[09:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> If they're interested.
[09:24:06] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: got any triagers you can recommend for us?
[09:24:14] <jzaefferer> We've got bugs, too!
[09:24:15] <jzaefferer> and trac
[09:24:18] <jzaefferer> and booze!
[09:24:31] <DaveMethvin> woo hoo, boozed triagers
[09:24:33] <bot-t> (13 hours 50 mins ago) <gibson042> tell DaveMethvin I still don't see the official voting widget; if we can't get it sorted out in time just count mikesherov's votes twice and that'll be pretty close ;)
[09:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> We're staying fairly level over time, which is actually good even though it sounds bad.
[09:24:36] <DaveMethvin> what could go wrong?
[09:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> I really need a graph of bugs, not all tickets.
[09:24:57] <scott_gonzalez> Because that should be going down.
[09:25:00] <DaveMethvin> i wish we had more triagers tbh
[09:25:00] <jzaefferer> Seriously though, could we for example ask Mike Sherov to help us out?
[09:25:11] <DaveMethvin> sure i bet mike would want to do that
[09:25:18] <scott_gonzalez> Mike actually would. He's done some triage for us before.
[09:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> He had some co-workers triage UI one day.
[09:25:51] <jzaefferer> That's good, but we're looking for a more permanent job, right?
[09:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> We have a triage table at the dev summit too.
[09:26:01] <ajpiano> there are 4 people working triage at the dev sumit besides petersendidit
[09:26:02] <petersendidit> yup
[09:26:09] <ajpiano> we just have to convince them to stick around :)
[09:26:13] <jzaefferer> on UI triage?
[09:26:15] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:26:21] <DaveMethvin> booze
[09:26:35] <jzaefferer> nice
[09:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: I put some links on the wiki page for the triage table.
[09:26:47] <petersendidit> saw that
[09:27:09] <jzaefferer> petersendidit: can you make it a priority to keep people involved beyond the summit? That would help a lot
[09:27:28] <petersendidit> Sure
[09:27:41] <jzaefferer> if people are looking for some kind of recognition, find out what it is...
[09:28:19] <jzaefferer> btw. looking forward to meeting you in person petersendidit :-)
[09:28:25] <petersendidit> me too
[09:28:34] <ajpiano> one of the traigers for UI is http://tjvantoll.com/
[09:28:50] <ajpiano> he seems like a good candidate for roping in, especialy :)
[09:28:50] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez is really the only one I have meet in person
[09:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm excited to finally meet TJ.
[09:29:52] <jzaefferer> So, looks like API docs will be done soon as well
[09:30:02] <jzaefferer> Now we just need to get hold of gnarf to get the sites live
[09:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> We're actually doing pretty good with the new workflow and APIs: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[09:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> As we work through more plugins, the red lines will go away.
[09:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> Also, deploying the new sites will drop some numbers.
[09:33:15] <jzaefferer> That's it for today?
[09:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that means it's time to get back to flooding everyone's inbox.
