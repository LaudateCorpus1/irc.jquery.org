[08:56:05] <DaveMethvin> .
[08:56:21] <DaveMethvin> who left the door open? now all the sticky buns are gone
[09:03:05] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gnarf rwaldron gibson042 Meetin time!
[09:03:38] <timmywil> hi
[09:03:43] <DaveMethvin> ohai
[09:03:46] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:03:54] <DaveMethvin> should be pretty fast today
[09:04:16] <timmywil> fyi, the door was closed
[09:04:24] <DaveMethvin> oh did you open it?
[09:04:25] <gnarf> tail end of the night for me - but here breifly
[09:04:40] <timmywil> i did
[09:04:44] <DaveMethvin> well thanks!
[09:04:46] <timmywil> you could chat cause you're an admin
[09:04:59] <DaveMethvin> oh i haven't disconnected
[09:05:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:05:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: :)
[09:05:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so um 1.8.3
[09:05:15] <DaveMethvin> today i hope
[09:05:20] <DaveMethvin> unless
[09:05:26] <DaveMethvin> you have objectoins?
[09:05:34] <gnarf> paul_irish would be mad if i didn't ask about uglify2 source maps landing
[09:05:45] <DaveMethvin> in 1.8.3?
[09:05:54] <gnarf> i'm nervous about switching in a point release - but he's very very excited to show it off
[09:06:03] <DaveMethvin> i think we should hold it for 1.9
[09:06:08] <DaveMethvin> let's just get 1.8.3 out
[09:06:08] <gnarf> delay to 1.9?
[09:06:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:06:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin are those like bitcoins?
[09:06:44] <gnarf> i feel thats probably best as well, but also am excited to see source maps on cdn
[09:06:44] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil 12801 depresses me
[09:07:09] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's already a Sizzle issue https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/122
[09:07:17] <DaveMethvin> ah ok so that can be closed
[09:07:22] <timmywil> the fix requires an explicit list of what attributes are treated case-insensitive
[09:07:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah :(
[09:07:53] <timmywil> yea, sux, which is why I never did it
[09:07:56] <DaveMethvin> hey i know who has that list THE BROWSER!
[09:08:03] <DaveMethvin> GIVE IT TO US
[09:08:19] <mikesherov> Hi
[09:08:33] <DaveMethvin> and of course this is some case of a stupid framework generating that crap in uppercase for no good reason
[09:08:41] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[09:08:51] <mikesherov> sorry I'm late
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> on 11290 ...
[09:09:11] <timmywil> nwmatcher has it done for us if we want it: https://gist.github.com/063bec04792485566f42
[09:09:37] <DaveMethvin> it's not the list as much as the size it takes to keep the list
[09:09:41] <timmywil> and yea, it's different for different document modes
[09:09:54] <gnarf> i hope that mikesherov and i can connect and push mergeatron forward after i return to the states this week
[09:10:10] <DaveMethvin> ok, it would be great to have that soon
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> it is so nice to test before landing
[09:10:39] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm almost done
[09:10:40] <timmywil> i like the name
[09:10:44] <mikesherov> :-)
[09:11:20] <mikesherov> if we wanted to do Mongo, we could have it today… but it's really just porting some of the sqllite stuff
[09:11:43] <mikesherov> some of the more advanced mongo stuff needs to get ported
[09:11:49] <mikesherov> but almost there
[09:12:31] <mikesherov> SOrry I keep pushing it back :-\
[09:12:37] <mikesherov> I just got power and home on friday
[09:12:44] <mikesherov> been kept busy elsewhere
[09:12:48] <DaveMethvin> so as i just told gnarf ... :D
[09:12:53] <DaveMethvin> 11290
[09:12:57] <mikesherov> sorry
[09:13:01] <DaveMethvin> no np
[09:13:05] <DaveMethvin> i typed in the wrong window
[09:13:15] <DaveMethvin> so 11290 i think we should realy encourage ppl to use parseHTML for random markup
[09:13:23] <mikesherov> yes
[09:13:26] <DaveMethvin> nd part of that is if they are processing a string they shoudln't have leading space
[09:13:37] <DaveMethvin> they should use parseHTML for unkown strings of HTML
[09:13:47] <DaveMethvin> and only $() for known literal strings
[09:13:59] <DaveMethvin> $("<p> .. </p>") etc
[09:14:00] <mikesherov> and theoretically never use $()
[09:14:02] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:14:11] <mikesherov> just for selectors
[09:14:19] <DaveMethvin> that avoids the need to trim the string too
[09:14:22] <DaveMethvin> which will be a bit faster
[09:14:26] <mikesherov> or, should we create $.select() :-P
[09:14:30] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:14:39] <DaveMethvin> actually it's not a dumb idea
[09:14:53] <DaveMethvin> when someone wants to ensure that something is a selector
[09:15:07] <gnarf> $.find or whatever doesn't work?
[09:15:25] <gnarf> the sizzle alias, i forget the exact entry point
[09:15:32] <DaveMethvin> i've never used it that way but hmmm
[09:15:34] <mikesherov> doesn't find need a context already?
[09:15:52] <mikesherov> Or is the default context ":root"?
[09:15:56] <DaveMethvin> well we don't document it so we'd need to ensure it's clean enough to expose
[09:16:44] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: did you have something going for the speed tests?
[09:16:53] <DaveMethvin> you had talked about dromaeoeoeoe
[09:16:56] <DaveMethvin> at one point
[09:17:18] <mikesherov> I think it's spelled droaeoeoeomeoeoeooeaoaoao
[09:17:27] <DaveMethvin> dromeeeeo, dromaaaaaho, perf tests coming and i wanna go home
[09:17:50] <DaveMethvin> so we need to get these 1.9 tix done
[09:17:54] <DaveMethvin> let's look at the list
[09:18:25] <DaveMethvin> this dmethvin guy is slow
[09:18:36] <DaveMethvin> i should be able to work on these this week
[09:18:42] <DaveMethvin> once 1.8.3 is out
[09:18:56] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: is there a ticket for the source maps?
[09:19:44] <gnarf> http://open.spotify.com/track/6HPbHOHTPV0uNMcR4D8Au1
[09:19:45] <b-ot> ♩ Jungle Love - Live by Morris Day ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮
[09:19:56] <gnarf> droameoeoe
[09:20:12] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if there is - i don't know it
[09:20:21] <DaveMethvin> ok well as long as we have one that's good
[09:20:22] <gnarf> just the email from paul in devs chat about it afaik
[09:20:31] <DaveMethvin> oh there isn't
[09:20:34] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[09:20:45] <DaveMethvin>  nope
[09:20:47] <DaveMethvin> lemme make one
[09:20:55] <gnarf> tyty - cc paul
[09:21:35] <mikesherov> so, the source maps stuff
[09:21:56] <mikesherov> doesn't this require Grunt 0.4
[09:22:02] <mikesherov> which isn't released yet?
[09:22:12] <mikesherov> I did some research on this as well already
[09:22:27] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, why does it need grunt 0.4?
[09:22:33] <mikesherov> well, uglify2
[09:22:51] <mikesherov> which is a grunt-contrib that is using Grunt 0.4
[09:23:08] <mikesherov> We can generate a 1 off source map no problem
[09:23:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't think this is critical at all, we would still want ppl to submit bugs with unminified if possible
[09:23:51] <DaveMethvin> it's mainly for debugging in production
[09:23:53] <DaveMethvin> for users
[09:24:02] <mikesherov> sure, I'm just saying that the depgraph leads to Grunt
[09:24:19] <timmywil> unassigned 1.9 http://bugs.jquery.com/query?owner=&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.9&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=changetime&report=506&order=owner
[09:24:24] <gnarf> and giving paul an awesome use case to say "jQuery has source maps on the cdn now too!"
[09:24:33] <DaveMethvin> so grunt 0.4 is like the plugins site, every week i hear a rumor that it's shipping in a coupla days
[09:25:04] <DaveMethvin> timmywil thanks, yeah we need to look at those
[09:25:08] <DaveMethvin> let's do that now
[09:26:05] <gnarf> nothing on that list jumps at me
[09:26:13] <DaveMethvin> i'm assuming we can get jaubourg to do the ajax ones
[09:26:19] <gnarf> so i'll take another look later - need sleep now - its 2:30am here
[09:26:37] <DaveMethvin> i have been doing the deprecated stuff, i'll grab that ticket
[09:26:45] <DaveMethvin> go sleep gnarf, gangnam style
[09:27:36] <mikesherov> so, how serious are we about 12757, and 12756?
[09:27:38] <timmywil> don't do that
[09:27:56] <timmywil> unless you're in an elevator
[09:28:04] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:28:29] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: neither are critical, nice to have tho
[09:28:34] <gnarf> 강남스타일
[09:28:37] <gnarf> 니니
[09:28:43] <timmywil> I vote we close this wontfix: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12863
[09:28:43] <mikesherov> I can take those DaveMethvin
[09:28:51] <timmywil> ?12863
[09:28:52] <bot-t> [#12863] IE8 - Object doesn't support this property or method (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/12863
[09:29:07] <DaveMethvin> it's pretty obscure but shoudl be easy to fix timmywil
[09:29:18] <DaveMethvin> and it's only 1.9, we can throw it out for 2.0
[09:29:55] <DaveMethvin> this one i feel like we could close wontfix http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9832
[09:29:57] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's not about fixing this one issue. It's a crap shoot that involves supporting the behavior css property
[09:30:24] <DaveMethvin> oh you're saying it may affect other stuff? yeah that's possible and he just tripped on this one first
[09:30:49] <mikesherov> 9832 we talked about already
[09:31:12] <timmywil> it could set us down a path we don't want to be.
[09:31:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's just a q of how much code it takes for any of these oldie fixes
[09:31:27] <mikesherov> we talked about 9832 and it fell under the blanket of "fix all the IE stuff for 1.9"
[09:31:40] <DaveMethvin> but that's the one timmywil mentioned as well
[09:31:59] <DaveMethvin> i am definitely conflicted
[09:32:07] <DaveMethvin> it seems like a good idea to fix all these oldie things
[09:32:15] <DaveMethvin> but then again i see the byte counts for the fixes...
[09:32:22] <DaveMethvin> and it makes me sad
[09:32:40] <mikesherov> we just dumped ~500B with the deprecated stuff
[09:32:47] <DaveMethvin> and we'll get a few more bytes
[09:33:00] <DaveMethvin> but these are sometimes 20 or 30 bytes to fix
[09:33:02] <mikesherov> yeah, and I'm going to spend a few on css array stuff
[09:33:15] <DaveMethvin> which i think are bytes well spent for that
[09:33:39] <mikesherov> sure
[09:33:50] <DaveMethvin> so if someone wants to grab them fine but if we get near the end and nobody fixed them i wouldn't feel bad if we wontfix
[09:34:16] <mikesherov> sure
[09:34:22] <DaveMethvin> the rest of these unassigned either look pretty simple, or are meta type tix
[09:34:28] <mikesherov> makes sense, so don't mark wontfix yet
[09:34:32] <mikesherov> just reduce priority
[09:34:46] <DaveMethvin> so i think we're in pretty good shape ... if we had some new contribs perhaps they coudl try to tackle soem of these
[09:34:55] <mikesherov> yup, I'm all over that
[09:35:08] <mikesherov> SNAP hack next week, any tickets better for new guys?
[09:35:21] <DaveMethvin> what can we do to re-connect with some of the people who were at the summit or expressed interest lately?
[09:35:39] <mikesherov> Reach out to them
[09:35:41] <DaveMethvin> i guess I could go through the landed patch contributors and just ping them perhaps?
[09:35:45] <mikesherov> with the tixx we definitely want
[09:35:53] <DaveMethvin> let me do that this week
[09:36:09] <mikesherov> k, g2g
[09:36:13] <mikesherov> lunch meeting
[09:36:29] <DaveMethvin> yep, i have to go as well
[09:36:35] <DaveMethvin> gotta take the dog to the vet
[09:36:44] <DaveMethvin> any other items or issues?
[09:37:11] * timmywil closed the door
[09:37:29] <DaveMethvin> cya in -dev!
[09:37:42] <timmywil> ;)
