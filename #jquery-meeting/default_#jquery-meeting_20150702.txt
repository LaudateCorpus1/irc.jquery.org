[09:00:44] <arthurvr> hey everybody
[09:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> Not many people here today.
[09:02:47] <arschmitz> im here
[09:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> jdalton has a PR for automating the retrieval of W3C tests: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/199
[09:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's ready to land.
[09:04:32] <arschmitz> Looks good to me anything i would say would just be a nitpick that does not really matter
[09:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> Isaac provided a first draft of the logo with the wordmark: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/161#issuecomment-117754543
[09:06:49] <arschmitz> yeah i like it with the wordmark in the shield
[09:07:00] <arthurvr> <3 it
[09:08:42] <jrossi1> +1
[09:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have anything else on the agenda. I was on vacation last week and have mostly just been catching up on stuff since I got back.
[09:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything to discuss?
[09:10:27] <jrossi1> one quick thing
[09:10:36] <arschmitz> jrossi1: want to work on setting up something about touch-action?
[09:10:59] <jrossi1> oh sure i promised that didn't I? :-/
[09:11:03] <jrossi1> will do
[09:11:35] <jrossi1> Regarding PR #168
[09:11:42] <jdalton> word
[09:11:56] <jrossi1> A new w-p-t test has been created for it
[09:11:57] <jrossi1> https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1949
[09:12:00] <jrossi1> I'm going to review that
[09:12:23] <jrossi1> scott_gonzalez: could I get you to review also since you're in the WG?
[09:12:32] <jrossi1> two should be sufficient for me to merge
[09:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:15:30] <jrossi1> thanks
[09:15:40] <jrossi1> ok, now that's all from me
[09:15:45] <jrossi1> oh wait
[09:15:47] <jrossi1> news update!
[09:16:01] <jrossi1> but shhhh...  let's let Mozilla announce this (I think they're planning it)
[09:16:22] <jrossi1> 100% passing pointer events was committed this week into trunk for Firefox
[09:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:16:36] <jrossi1> requires enabling their APZ scroller, which is unfinished (under a flag)
[09:17:01] <jrossi1> but even without APZ, mouse/pen work just fine (only required for touch support)
[09:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> jdalton: Before you joined, we said that your PR is good to land.
[09:18:37] <jdalton> rock, I made the change you commented on too
[09:19:19] <scott_gonzalez> The path exists check?
[09:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, you just pushed that.
[09:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:25:47] <arthurvr> that update you just pushed is it okay to use the fs.exists method it’s deprecated?
[09:26:10] <arthurvr> anyways we can fight that out in the ticket :p
[09:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably never going away.
[09:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> The "right" way to do this is to just read from the file.
[09:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> And then catch the error and see if the error was caused from the file not existing.
[09:29:34] <arthurvr> still then I’d prefer not to use it but alright no big deal
[09:29:57] <arthurvr> Sindre Sorhus (of course, lol) built an easy module to replace it too
[09:30:00] <arthurvr> anyways no big
[09:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't want us to get hung up on that detail, but if you're inclined to change it, feel free :-)
[09:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> I just merged to master.
[09:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[09:30:55] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:30:56] <arthurvr> no big deal :p that’s it I guess
[11:01:33] <arschmitz> agcolom: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: cgack sfrisk: arthurvr: apsdehal: meeting time
[11:01:38] <arthurvr> hey!
[11:01:40] <apsdehal> Hey
[11:01:44] <agcolom> hello!
[11:01:50] <jasperdegroot> hi
[11:01:52] <cgack> howdy
[11:03:28] <arschmitz> is anyone else having trouble with google sheets / the agenda
[11:03:35] <arschmitz> i keep getting server errors
[11:03:52] <arthurvr> works for me
[11:04:03] <jasperdegroot> no problems here
[11:04:39] <cgack> seems to work for me
[11:04:50] <arschmitz> ok does someone mind making a tab for this week
[11:04:56] <arschmitz> and updating as we go
[11:06:05] <arschmitz> ok so PR count is way up this week
[11:06:17] <agcolom> done :-)
[11:06:30] <agcolom> issues -30 PR +7
[11:06:31] <arschmitz> but thats because i opened a bunch
[11:06:43] <arschmitz> and have more coming before the day is done
[11:06:54] <arschmitz> so anyone that has time there are a bunch that need to be reviewed
[11:07:21] <arschmitz> as far as i know there is only one PR waiting on review by me
[11:07:37] <arschmitz> which is cgack's slider one
[11:07:45] <arschmitz> iv reviewed the code and it looks good
[11:07:56] <arschmitz> i just need to do some manual testing on a few devices
[11:08:14] <cgack> awesome
[11:08:38] <arschmitz> I did a lot of issue triage for 1.5 this week
[11:08:49] <arschmitz> all the issues that have pr's have a label saying so
[11:09:37] <arschmitz> once you exclude demo issues issues for removing deprecated code and issues which have PR's we are getting pretty low
[11:10:15] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+-label%3A%22Remove+deprecated+code%22+is%3Aissue+-label%3ATests+-label%3ADemos+-label%3A%22Status%3A+Has+PR%22+milestone%3A1.5.0&utf8=%E2%9C%93
[11:11:37] <arschmitz> some of those still might be ones we can move to 1.6
[11:12:47] <arschmitz> aside from my PR's most of the open ones are gabrielschulhof's and he is not here it seems
[11:14:35] <arschmitz> one of the big blockers left is the download builder
[11:14:42] <arschmitz> but thats blocked on the UI side still
[11:16:23] <jasperdegroot> is that a blocker for alpha/beta?
[11:16:36] <arschmitz> we cant do custom builds without it
[11:16:43] <jasperdegroot> of course more people will test if it's available on db
[11:16:53] <arschmitz> and ui is considdering it a blocker for their's
[11:17:06] <arschmitz> so its more or less one for us too
[11:17:08] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:19:01] <arschmitz> cgack: what is your next step?
[11:19:21] <cgack> try to get some time to work on anything jquery :)
[11:19:40] <cgack> actually I'm gonna look at rangeslider next, now that slider is ready to land
[11:19:46] <cgack> or re-look at rangeslider
[11:20:39] <cgack> then try to carve out some time for the remaining (toolbar & navbar) then I think that's it
[11:20:40] <arschmitz> cool
[11:20:52] <arschmitz> awesome that will keep you busy for a bit
[11:20:57] <cgack> indeed!
[11:21:01] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: your still working on demos right?
[11:21:13] <jasperdegroot> yes
[11:21:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: did you get my message about controlgroup?
[11:21:34] <jasperdegroot> but the issues that I mentioned last week needs to be fixed before i can finish
[11:21:43] <arschmitz> ill take that as a no
[11:21:48] <arschmitz> that issue is the demos
[11:21:54] <arschmitz> they all have invalid markup
[11:21:57] <jasperdegroot> no I didn't get it, sorry
[11:22:11] <arschmitz> they all have the corner classes on the element in the markup
[11:22:21] <jasperdegroot> hmm
[11:23:25] <jasperdegroot> why did we do that?
[11:23:30] <arschmitz> i have no idea
[11:23:35] <arschmitz> its everywhere in the demos
[11:23:50] <jasperdegroot> maybe I am the one to blame
[11:23:54] <arschmitz> the old controlgroup didnt use classes so it removed it
[11:24:14] <arschmitz> but since the new one uses classes it only checks it self for what classes to change not the element directly
[11:24:30] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:24:33] <arschmitz> so it has no idea it needs to remove them
[11:24:43] <jasperdegroot> yeah makes sense
[11:24:50] <jasperdegroot> ok I will remove them
[11:24:55] <arschmitz> nor should it really there is no reason for those to have that class on them unless you wanted it to look that way
[11:25:17] <jasperdegroot> how about the icon issue?
[11:25:27] <jasperdegroot> icons in controlgroup lack the space span
[11:25:43] <jasperdegroot> maybe also markup problem
[11:25:49] <jasperdegroot> I will look into it again
[11:26:01] <jasperdegroot> and let you know what problems remain after cleaning up the markup
[11:26:13] <gabrielschulhof> Hey! Sorry! Wall clock stopped!
[11:26:22] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:26:32] <jasperdegroot> hey Gabriel
[11:26:39] <gabrielschulhof> ... and I experienced a bout of jetlag.
[11:26:51] <gabrielschulhof> Anyway ...
[11:27:07] <arschmitz> so i think we just need to update the markup
[11:27:30] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:29:08] <arschmitz> Im going to push a PR updating collapsible / set demos
[11:29:14] <arschmitz> after meeting
[11:29:21] <arschmitz> and the widget for new icons
[11:29:59] <jasperdegroot> great
[11:31:35] <arschmitz> so unless someone has something else i think thats all i have for this week with out gabrielschulhof being here
[11:31:56] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: did my fix of removing the duplicate ID work for enhancer?
[11:32:46] <gabrielschulhof> It worked for me.
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: you alright there? you seem like your stuck in a loop :-)
[11:33:29] <jasperdegroot> huh?
[11:33:55] <jasperdegroot> I don't notice anything odd
[11:33:57] <gabrielschulhof> Oh ... I see ... you just submitted the enhance-multiple PR - so, I guess that means it worked.
[11:36:06] <gabrielschulhof> Other than that, I've been working on arschmitz' review comments for popup. Should be pretty ready for another round.
[11:36:34] <gabrielschulhof> Other than /that/, I've been on vacation, and now I'm back until August 8th.
[11:36:58] <gabrielschulhof> So, that's about it for me.
[11:38:26] <arschmitz> i think jasperdegroot might be lagging
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> lol
[11:38:41] <jasperdegroot> ok i rejoin
[11:38:49] <arschmitz> ok im going to close the room lol
[11:39:02] <arschmitz> see everyone back on -dev
[11:39:05] <gabrielschulhof> K L8R
