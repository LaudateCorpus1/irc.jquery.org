[09:02:10] <rworth> hey all
[09:02:34] <ajpiano> hi rworth
[09:02:37] * jonathansampson waves
[09:02:41] <jzaefferer> hello
[09:02:45] <gnarf> mornin
[09:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[09:02:56] * gnarf rubs eyes
[09:03:03] <rworth> I'm mostly here, jzaefferer and scott_gonzalez, can you take it away?
[09:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> I added jquery-ui.git to jqueryui.com/development
[09:03:57] <jzaefferer> is danheberden here?
[09:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: any update on the various infrastructure items?
[09:04:22] <danheberden> ya - just got in :)
[09:04:36] <danheberden> so all the jqui versions are up on the cdn
[09:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:04:58] <danheberden> also, i just finished revamping the hotlinking code to allow themeroller to work without having to mess with themeroller
[09:05:00] <ajpiano> they're not on the index yet though, right
[09:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> what do we need to do in the future to get new versions added?
[09:05:10] <danheberden> since all of it's work is done by making the images on the spot with the css generator thingy
[09:05:23] <alexiswilliams> are the new milestones avail, too?
[09:05:32] <alexiswilliams> like 1.9 with menu?
[09:05:41] <danheberden> alexiswilliams we have a git version for that
[09:05:46] <danheberden> so it's just 'the latest'
[09:05:51] <alexiswilliams> o i c
[09:05:53] <danheberden> instead of each milestone
[09:06:06] <jzaefferer> well, but could make sense to put milestone releases on our CDN as well
[09:06:07] <rworth> yup, milestones are just so you have a zip file instead of pointing at git
[09:06:11] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez it can be added to the cdn when you build, but you can just have eddiemonge or I do it
[09:06:14] <rworth> er -git
[09:06:27] <eddiemonge> do what?
[09:06:33] <danheberden> get ui onto code.jquery.com
[09:06:39] <danheberden> e.g. 1.8.14
[09:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok,
[09:07:08] <eddiemonge> yeah no problem. just give me some details and i can whip up an auto push if you want
[09:08:08] <danheberden> ya, the code listing stuff is another topic but we'd like to get it at least somewhat automated - though the build process for a full ui version will probably continue to be manual
[09:08:15] <danheberden> and it's not particularly difficult
[09:08:38] <RWhitbeck> I am here.
[09:08:49] <danheberden> expires header is pending a meeting in the (hopefully) next day or two, still waiting on mt's response
[09:08:53] <danheberden> hi RWhitbeck :)
[09:09:09] <alexiswilliams> i don't know if this is the right forum. i am n00b on jquery... just immigrated from dojo... sortable with multiple draggable, does not look natively supported. is there a solution that someone can cite?
[09:09:16] <RWhitbeck> hi danheberden
[09:09:26] <RWhitbeck> so no 5pm today an with mt?
[09:09:42] <danheberden> alexiswilliams #jquery is probably your best bet for support-ish stuff
[09:09:55] <alexiswilliams> cool thanks i will try that forum
[09:10:04] <RWhitbeck> and jQuery UI is the library you want to look at http://jqueryui.com
[09:10:14] <danheberden> RWhitbeck it's not looking very good, but then it's just 9am here so they might have just gotten into the office?
[09:10:24] <danheberden> ( i didn't get back to them until early this morning :(  )
[09:10:55] <RWhitbeck> ok just let me know
[09:10:58] <jonathansampson> alexiswilliams Bring your jQuery questions to http://stackoverflow.com - we'd love to help you there as well ;)
[09:11:11] <danheberden> will do
[09:11:16] <danheberden> i think that's all for infra
[09:11:25] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ^
[09:11:25] <RWhitbeck> hey jonathansampson
[09:11:29] <alexiswilliams> will do. i saw some stuff there, but nothing quite on the mark yet.
[09:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> what about view.jqueryui.com dir listings?
[09:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> anyone in particular assigned to it?
[09:12:29] <jonathansampson> Hello, Ralph. Trying to be a silent observer - sorry to speak up ;)
[09:12:35] <danheberden> no, not yet - i'm going to bring it up to the ML and ask someone to volunteer for it
[09:12:46] <danheberden> i just had time for the themeswitcher/ui stuffs
[09:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> on to docs
[09:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> any news from MS P+P about their widget factory chapter?
[09:14:02] <ajpiano> supposedly they were gonna send it "later today" yesterday
[09:14:05] <ajpiano> but i haven't gotten it yet
[09:14:07] <RWhitbeck> they posted it to codeplex
[09:14:20] <ajpiano> got a link?
[09:14:37] <RWhitbeck> i'll dig it up
[09:14:43] <jzaefferer> btw hey RWhitbeck, good to see you again on a UI meeting :-)
[09:14:50] <ajpiano> thanks
[09:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> http://silk.codeplex.com/releases/view/66995#DownloadId=243130
[09:15:35] <RWhitbeck> http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/project-silk-documentation-drop-new-chapters-ready-for-review/
[09:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> I found my old color-div demo
[09:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> gave the code to jzaefferer
[09:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> it's pretty old though (1.7.x)
[09:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: any progress on updating it?
[09:17:43] <jzaefferer> nope, not yet
[09:17:46] <jzaefferer> haven't started
[09:17:51] <jzaefferer> maybe tomorrow
[09:18:05] <jzaefferer> regarding silk: they got custom namespaces right!
[09:18:46] <rworth> :)
[09:19:24] <rworth> not certain, but I feel like that's something we may have pointed out to them early on. Can't remember. or maybe they already had it right by the time we saw the first bit of code
[09:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: XML update?
[09:21:02] <RWhitbeck> is there anything else to discuss?  Or are we done...meeting isn't moving along it seems
[09:21:17] <rworth> open item is for our team to write two script junkie articles about the widget factory, silk would be a great mention in at least one of them, if not both. We also could approach doing these along with updates to widget factory docs
[09:21:36] <jzaefferer> RWhitbeck, see http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda
[09:21:59] <rworth> no update on XML. still. Same as I said last week, but I'll try to do it before the end of this week
[09:22:04] <jzaefferer> rworth: is there an author for the JS articles?
[09:22:05] <ajpiano> i am going to start looking over the widget stuff in project silk
[09:22:14] <rworth> that is, get a wiki page up and do a dump so others can start pitching in
[09:22:45] <jzaefferer> that should help, currently there's no way but asking you to figure out what's going on
[09:22:46] <ajpiano> jzaefferer, yes i'm gonna be driving the article bus
[09:23:01] <gnarf> also no update on effects docs... my birthday + memorial day weekend sucked up a ton of time...  Will do my best to have at least 2 or 3 effects documented and maybe the addClass/removeClass/toggleClass extensions
[09:23:09] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, good. let me know if you need a tech reviewer
[09:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> docs meeting?
[09:23:36] <gnarf> try again, again?
[09:23:42] <jzaefferer> let's try again, on a non-holiday
[09:23:43] <rworth> not on a holiday? ;)
[09:23:46] <rworth> yeah
[09:23:47] <ajpiano> will do
[09:23:48] <danheberden> heh, ya - and non-birthdays
[09:23:54] <danheberden> me 'n gnarf partied TOO hard
[09:24:03] <jzaefferer> next Monday?
[09:24:09] <rworth> ok
[09:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> same time? 11 ET?
[09:24:27] <rworth> and I'll try to have my part done well before then, but abs no later than then
[09:24:37] <rworth> worksforme
[09:24:57] <ajpiano> do we want to do it on tues so it doesn't conflict with core?
[09:25:11] <jzaefferer> updated calendar and sent out a few invites
[09:25:17] <danheberden> 11EDT would make sure we keep it to an hour
[09:25:17] <rworth> worried about it going over time?
[09:25:23] <jzaefferer> we've got an hour, that has to be enough
[09:25:30] <rworth> concur
[09:25:35] <jzaefferer> confirm!
[09:25:41] <danheberden> AGREEANCE
[09:25:42] <ajpiano> oh, cool.
[09:25:52] <jzaefferer> next
[09:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> selectmenu
[09:26:25] <jzaefferer> selectmenu is part of grid stage 3, but also kind of long overdue anyway, Filament Group still getting a lot of requests
[09:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> who wants to help implement selectmenu?
[09:26:31] <jzaefferer> Felix Nagel is maintainging a fork
[09:26:40] <jzaefferer> I want to get those interested working on design and rewrite
[09:26:49] <jzaefferer> we'll be doing a planning and spec meeting sometime soon
[09:27:01] <jzaefferer> if you're interested, say so, and we'll invite you as well
[09:27:08] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ping me about it, at the very least I'd like to sit in
[09:27:14] <jzaefferer> should be on Skype, as working on functional specs via irc is not cool
[09:27:25] <jzaefferer> I'll invite Felix as well
[09:27:48] <jzaefferer> need to ping David Petersen (?), he's also working on that (as on everything else)
[09:27:53] <jzaefferer> gnarf, cool
[09:27:56] <jzaefferer> anyone else?
[09:27:59] <ajpiano> i've implemented selectmenu in production before, i have some feedback as to some minor stuff that could be improved
[09:28:10] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, you're in!
[09:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: you got his name right
[09:28:58] <mandragorn> ping me too, I want to sit in to get some insight into the design process for jQuery-ui
[09:29:22] <jzaefferer> mandragorn, okay, can you pm me?
[09:29:24] <rworth> perhaps we should make a list of interested people on the wiki page?
[09:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> good idea
[09:29:52] <rworth> than wiki lurkers than may not be lurking here can get notified of a chance to sit in
[09:30:00] <rworth> then even
[09:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> post the date/time for the meeting and ask people to add themselves to a list of participants
[09:30:28] <jzaefferer> okay, I'll take care of that
[09:30:51] <danheberden> or a list of interesting people?
[09:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think Dan just flash caged
[09:31:30] <rworth> FLASHCAGE
[09:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok, next up
[09:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> tooltip is pretty much done
[09:32:01] <jzaefferer> thanks to scott_gonzalez
[09:32:05] <rworth> thanks to scott_gonzalez
[09:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> got some accessibility stuff to work on
[09:32:18] <jzaefferer> Hans Hillen is looking into that
[09:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> but the API is pretty solid, good test coverage and updated demos
[09:32:32] <jzaefferer> he's not here, but we talked with him earlier
[09:32:55] <mandragorn> accessibility in general or on tooltip?
[09:32:55] <rworth> beautiful demos
[09:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> heh, mandragorn both, but I was specifically talking about tooltip
[09:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> there are some quirks in older IEs
[09:33:52] <jzaefferer> actually that issue with removeAttr happens in all IEs, even IE9
[09:34:01] <jzaefferer> is that on the wiki page?
[09:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right
[09:34:30] <jzaefferer> ah, yeah, down at Open issues
[09:34:37] <jzaefferer> ARIA impl in IE
[09:34:37] <jzaefferer> setting attr("title", "") prevents IE to expose Name attribute to screenreaders, so JAWS just reads the description. Removing it via .removeAttr("title") has the bad side effect, when done in mouseover event, of the native tooltip still showing up, with whatever title attribute value the element had when the event was triggered.
[09:34:41] <mandragorn> scott: ok I'll be looking into adding some accessibility stuff to datepicker, I may poke you later.
[09:35:01] <jzaefferer> mandragorn, let's talk about that in #jqueryui-dev
[09:35:08] <jzaefferer> we've got Hans Hillen starting to work on that as well
[09:35:23] <mandragorn> ok
[09:35:45] <jzaefferer> he'll be focusing on the prototype here: http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/datepicker-rewrite/index.html
[09:36:02] <jzaefferer> anyway, Spinner - Scott, anything to discuss there?
[09:36:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh, when working on tooltip, I fixed the implementation of _show and _hide in the base widget
[09:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fairly sure the code can be reduced a bit
[09:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> if anyone wants to look at that, go ahead
[09:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> there's full test coverage now, so you'll know if it's working
[09:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> haven't dug into spinner too much yet
[09:37:02] <scott_gonzalez> but I think there was a todo that seemed done
[09:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> first todo: get/set formatted number as string: use value option
[09:37:34] <jzaefferer> not sure, could be
[09:37:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok, when I start digging into the widget I'll check
[09:38:34] <jzaefferer> okay, onto the fun topics: Download builder rewrite and ThemeRoller redo
[09:38:55] <jzaefferer> I know nothing about that, haven't noticed any activity
[09:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard of any progress
[09:39:47] <danheberden> i haven't started in on my stuff yet
[09:40:23] <eddiemonge> is there a spec doc or anything for it?
[09:40:26] <rworth> I'll follow up with a couple folks again on this over the next week
[09:40:28] <RWhitbeck> Do we have a spec
[09:40:41] <rworth> we started a spec for themeroller rewrite on the wiki
[09:40:45] <danheberden> just a team lead
[09:41:10] <danheberden> were all the old docs lost in the typewithme crap?
[09:41:17] <rworth> we had a spec for download builder but lost it, but we can generally uses the existing site as a reference, it doesn't need near as many changes as TR
[09:41:26] <jzaefferer> would be good to put everything going on there on the wiki, have discussions in #jqueryui-dev
[09:41:38] <rworth> concur
[09:41:39] <jzaefferer> or is there an appropiate mailing list for that?
[09:41:43] <danheberden> ok
[09:41:43] <rworth> no
[09:42:02] <danheberden> since it's no longer in the agenda, am i sitll responsible for TR?
[09:42:06] <rworth> and I don't think it would make sense, they too closely involve every jQuery UI team member
[09:42:21] <ajpiano> -dev and wiki seems best, another list would just be fragment'y
[09:42:24] <rworth> danheberden: you're leading that? problem solved ;)
[09:43:09] <danheberden> yeah, just need to get a better idea where we were/needs/etc
[09:43:10] <RWhitbeck> danheberden I think what would be best is to flush out the specs and get consensus so we can move forward.
[09:43:11] <eddiemonge> has it been working lately?
[09:43:19] <danheberden> RWhitbeck sounds reasonable
[09:43:29] <danheberden> since we don't have them anymore :(
[09:43:38] <danheberden> eddiemonge aye
[09:44:04] <RWhitbeck> this maybe a strong candidate for seeking funding to move the development along faster?  agree/disagree?
[09:44:23] <danheberden> RWhitbeck agree
[09:45:09] <rworth> confirm!
[09:45:18] <danheberden> you're on a roll with that today rworth
[09:45:26] <rworth> no, I concured before
[09:45:26] <RWhitbeck> So next steps.  Dan to lead spec development and time/costs estimates?
[09:45:33] <rworth> jzaefferer confirmed
[09:45:40] <danheberden> lol
[09:45:51] <jzaefferer> so, how do we get the frontend/backend teams involved?
[09:45:55] <gnarf> danheberden is sexy
[09:45:56] <jzaefferer> seems like they won't meet anytime soon
[09:45:58] <danheberden> RWhitbeck yeah - lets get an idea of this monster before we dive into production
[09:46:03] <danheberden> gnarf inorite?!
[09:46:12] <rworth> lay out our plan and see if they volunteer? ;)
[09:46:15] <danheberden> jzaefferer when you figure that out......
[09:46:17] * gnarf was waiting for the "confirm!"
[09:46:28] <eddiemonge> who are the frontend/backend teams?
[09:46:29] <danheberden> gnarf gah! missed it
[09:46:40] <danheberden> eddiemonge we keep them locked in a basement
[09:46:45] <rworth> hard to say, without a list
[09:47:04] <danheberden> strobe and doug
[09:47:08] <danheberden> boom done
[09:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> and Darcy
[09:47:12] <danheberden> oh and darcy
[09:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> and Eddie?
[09:47:14] <danheberden> heh
[09:47:19] * danheberden is just being silly
[09:47:30] <eddiemonge> oh yeah i guess im on the front end team too now
[09:47:43] <danheberden> eddiemonge welcome to the TR rebuild project!
[09:47:57] <eddiemonge> but we are scheduling a design meeting for next week and darcy and i are going to work on the new design this week
[09:48:02] <jzaefferer> dan, as the new lead for this subproject, can you get in touch with Yehuda and Doug, one by one, and see what they can offer?
[09:48:10] <RWhitbeck> eddiemonge is also on middle management team...congrats
[09:48:15] <jzaefferer> or that
[09:48:37] <danheberden> jzaefferer definitely, just need to figure out what to, you know, talk to them about
[09:48:49] <RWhitbeck> jzaefferer I think we should tackle spec first before approaching anyone.
[09:49:03] <jzaefferer> okay, that makes sense
[09:49:18] <jzaefferer> silly me assumed we knew what we want there...
[09:49:31] <danheberden> jzaefferer bwhahahahaha
[09:49:52] <RWhitbeck> WE may but do we have a way to convey that to someone else who is going to work on it?
[09:50:00] <danheberden> an array of levels and pulleys to build a theme
[09:50:08] <danheberden> *levers
[09:50:23] <RWhitbeck> danheberden that would be awesome if you could do it in minecraft
[09:50:23] <danheberden> ya, we need a nice plan/map of what needs to happen
[09:50:24] <jzaefferer> including boss fights?
[09:50:35] <danheberden> jzaefferer sounds like a perfect easter egg
[09:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> levels :-) we're adding gaming to TR :-P
[09:50:59] <gnarf> will the konami code unlock unlimited themes? :)
[09:50:59] <RWhitbeck> achievements +1
[09:51:21] <RWhitbeck> someones tracking all these awesome ideas right?
[09:51:28] <rworth> the only spec we really need is to remove all themes and have only hot dog stand theme
[09:51:31] <danheberden> that's what jqlog is fore
[09:51:33] <danheberden> *for
[09:51:43] <RWhitbeck> and banana stand theme
[09:51:45] <gnarf> lemonade stand themeroller?
[09:51:49] <danheberden> just don't come crying to me when swanky purse is the default
[09:51:52] <jzaefferer> okay, as we're running out of time: we got a ton of ugly bugs (some with pull requests) that we should tackle
[09:51:58] <jzaefferer> irc meeting is not good for that
[09:52:17] <jzaefferer> Scott mentioned last week we should have a seperate meeeting for that
[09:52:21] <ajpiano> do we need to have a power triage sesh
[09:52:24] <jzaefferer> preferably inviting some CSS gurus
[09:52:39] <gnarf> ui triage / pull nights?
[09:52:42] <gnarf> days?
[09:52:51] <gnarf> lemme know when, and I'll be there ;)
[09:52:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez?
[09:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> we should schedule a time for a group triage
[09:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> let's figure out a time later
[09:54:34] <ajpiano> i vote for a tuesday.
[09:54:46] <danheberden> we're running out of days to do stuff :/
[09:54:55] <ajpiano> that's why i picked tuesday ;)
[09:55:03] <danheberden> :p
[09:55:10] <gnarf> i vote for your mom?
[09:55:12] <ajpiano> just do the same thing we did for jqcore in march
[09:56:43] <jzaefferer> okay, skipping a few entries, gnarf, anything about color and effects in the context of UI to discuss?
[09:56:54] <gnarf> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ -- play with it!
[09:57:07] <gnarf> other than that, my next big target is docs
[09:57:10] <gnarf> then back to bugs
[09:57:11] <jzaefferer> so that is now a core plugin, right?
[09:57:18] <jzaefferer> okay, good
[09:57:30] <gnarf> jzaefferer: by naming only i assume... we need to pull it in as an external
[09:57:43] <jzaefferer> core as in core team is responsible for it
[09:57:44] <gnarf> jzaefferer: but yeah, theoretically "core plugin"
[09:57:48] <jzaefferer> not UI team
[09:57:56] <RWhitbeck> I didn't even know that got posted.
[09:58:56] <gnarf> yeah, not UI's responsibility, but it does kill like 5 bugs in effects :)
[09:59:14] <jzaefferer> and will probably affect a lot more, as it was part of UI...
[10:00:04] <jzaefferer> RWhitbeck: we (or core team?) should figure out how to handle core plugins and announcements, afaik it was discussed in the last weeks here or in #jqueryui-dev
[10:01:11] <ajpiano> besides posting them on the blog?
[10:01:17] <ajpiano> ....
[10:01:23] <ajpiano> i also actually have to run to get on a call
[10:01:34] <jzaefferer> guess that's it for today for jQuery UI, now starting with jQuery UI Grid meeting
[10:02:14] <jzaefferer> borismoore is here, Brad isn't?
[10:02:45] <borismoore> brad should be joining... give him a couple of minutes?
[10:02:50] <jzaefferer> agenda at bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda - starts at 65
[10:03:29] <jzaefferer> and I hear Felix Nagel now also made is, hi re-aktor
[10:04:18] <jzaefferer> while we wait another minute, we've got some progress on grid editing, documented on these two pages:
[10:04:19] <jzaefferer> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40076465/Grid-Editing
[10:04:21] <jzaefferer> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40632995/Grid-Editing-Events
[10:04:30] <re-aktor> hi there
[10:04:38] <borismoore> brad is here now
[10:05:00] <jzaefferer> the first one has three demos, all using mostly just basic jQuery and the widget factory, no custom/grid-specific abstractions in there yet
[10:05:17] <jzaefferer> still trying to figure out what the right abstractions are, part of that is the Events page
[10:05:35] <jzaefferer> Brad updated that recently, haven't yet gotten a change to work through the update though
[10:06:00] <jzaefferer> brado23, how far along is that?
[10:06:49] <brado23> I took a shot at a spec for data change events (the 2nd URL).  Happy to hear comments, feedback.
[10:07:32] <brado23> This is inspired by the prototyping work that Boris and I have shared in the past few months, although change events had been a detail of those prototypes.
[10:07:44] <jzaefferer> in regards to objectchange: what if multiple fields are changed?
[10:07:47] <jzaefferer> at once
[10:07:59] <brado23> To me, this'd mean separate change events.
[10:08:07] <brado23> ...one per discrete field change.
[10:08:18] <chrisBannon> Some feedback on events: I think it is important to have a objectChanging event too. I don't think you can rely on just notifying after a change. You will need this in order to intercept changes and validate them and what not
[10:08:49] <jzaefferer> that's a good point - a cancellable beforechange?
[10:08:50] <brado23> Yes, that's something we can consider.  I don't have strong feelings about this pre-change eventing.
[10:09:04] <jzaefferer> do we need both?
[10:09:20] <brado23> I find myself wondering how pre-change eventing relates to Joern's "editing" work.  I wonder whether we cook this into the eventing.
[10:09:20] <chrisBannon> For scenarios like parsing, validation and formatting this event is important.
[10:09:46] <jzaefferer> probably yes, as we don't want to have the mess that is currenlty in jQuery's change event, where the checked state of a checkbox changes after your event handlers runs, but not always
[10:09:49] <brado23> Not expressing a preference now, but there are alternatives to doing this through eventing.
[10:10:14] <jzaefferer> brado23, my work so far is just building prototypes, I haven't defined or abstracted anything, so all open to change
[10:10:33] <jzaefferer> we should lay out what the alternatives are
[10:11:15] <jzaefferer> there are cases where you want to have an event before the change happens, to prevent it, and cases where you want to just store the updated object, after it happened
[10:11:42] <brado23> Yes, agreed on the scenario.
[10:11:43] <jzaefferer> what about a per-field event, triggered before changing anything, and a per-object-event, triggered after updating the object?
[10:11:54] <jzaefferer> if you stop the before-event, the after-event is also stopped
[10:12:08] <chrisBannon> Agreed, both are important.
[10:12:53] <mikesamuel> By stopping a change do you mean something like java's VetoableChangeListener?
[10:13:21] <brado23> This makes sense.  I expect that the before-event would be optional, right?  There will be scenarios where it doesn't make sense to reject a change (like changes due to new $.ajax data hitting the client).
[10:13:23] <jzaefferer> mikesamuel, maybe, but mostly like cancellable events in jQuery UI
[10:13:29] <mikesamuel> k
[10:13:50] <chrisBannon> @jzaefferer, I think beforeChange and change should both be on field. I would also have a change event on object too.
[10:14:35] <jzaefferer> so beforefieldchange, fieldchange, objectchange?
[10:14:40] <jzaefferer> or need also a beforeobjectchange?
[10:14:52] <chrisBannon> i am not sure beforeObjectChange is needed
[10:14:58] <brado23> sorry what's the "field" / "object" distinction?
[10:15:08] <brado23> Is it that "object" can convey multiple field changes?
[10:15:09] <jzaefferer> field event: a field changed
[10:15:19] <jzaefferer> object event: the object changed, without specifics on fields
[10:15:26] <brado23> Ah, got it.
[10:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> the objectchange event would occur after all fieldchange events
[10:15:40] <brado23> thx
[10:15:58] <jzaefferer> so a cancelled beforefieldchange event would also prevent the fieldchange event
[10:16:00] <jzaefferer> right?
[10:16:06] <chrisBannon> yes
[10:16:10] <jzaefferer> would it also prevent objectchange?
[10:16:14] <chrisBannon> yes
[10:16:24] <jzaefferer> what if you cancel one of two field changes?
[10:16:44] <brado23> seems like you still get an object change, since the object _did_ change
[10:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> it depends
[10:16:50] <chrisBannon> the non-cancelled event raises the objectchange event
[10:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> if anything on the object actually changes, then objectchange would get triggered
[10:17:14] <brado23> yep
[10:17:36] <jzaefferer> the objectchange could convey that part of the change got rejected
[10:17:58] <jzaefferer> in form validation, I may want to prevent the entire submit for a single invalid field
[10:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> would that be useful in any scenario?
[10:18:02] <chrisBannon> the point of cancelling the beforefieldchange is to prevent the object from being modified with invalid data (for exampl)
[10:18:06] <mikesamuel> @zaefferer can you have two fields change atomically or not change at all by beginning both changes and only carrying through the changes if neither begin change is cancelled?  Can two changes be in-flight at once?  If so, do you get two object change events or can they be collapsed to one?
[10:18:53] <jzaefferer> mikesamuel, Brad mentioned earlier that there should be individual fieldchange events for every field
[10:19:11] <jzaefferer> the objectchange would be the collapsed variant
[10:19:13] <jzaefferer> right?
[10:19:25] <brado23> yes, that sounds right.
[10:19:41] <brado23> mike is talking about the pre-change events though and whether we/he can use this as a tx
[10:19:46] <brado23> transaction
[10:20:06] <mikesamuel> @jzaefferer, I understand that, but my question is does every field change have to complete before another begins?  If so, harmony proxies can be used to trivially implement field changes for any object, but if not they can't.
[10:20:20] <mikesamuel> @brado23, exactly
[10:20:21] <jzaefferer> I don't know
[10:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> mikesamuel: I think one at a time
[10:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> also, we can't use harmony proxies
[10:20:57] <borismoore> You can call setField on individual fields, or no several fields at once, like attr and css()
[10:21:16] <borismoore> When you do several, they are like a transaction for hte object
[10:21:32] <mikesamuel> @scott_gonzales, you can't assume them, but it's nice to know whether in the distant future they'll fit well into your scheme.
[10:22:26] <brado23> Re: tx, as long as we allow for someone building a tx concept on top, we don't have to go knee deep into making sure every atomicity scenario is accounted for directly.
[10:22:58] <brado23> We could go only as far as Boris' "setField can set multiple fields at once" idea, for instance.
[10:23:08] <borismoore> And we need to target simplicity = perf
[10:23:10] <chrisBannon> You can always have an event option that determines when the grid actually pushes the edits to the model
[10:23:26] <brado23> exactly
[10:23:33] <chrisBannon> then you can support both "batch" edits with full row validation or single field validation
[10:23:58] <brado23> yes, this can be a Grid concept (that of buffering up changes)
[10:24:08] <jzaefferer> I added an open issues section to the Editing Events page, please take a look if that covers the questions brought up here
[10:24:44] <borismoore> It is always possible to cache/copy objects, and make changes on them before committing the changes to the original objects
[10:25:11] <borismoore> So transactions can be added on top with out hitting basic perf
[10:25:24] <brado23> Re: open issues, let's make sure we treat "I want to make data changes in a tx" and "I want to hear about events in a batch so I can do optimal rerender" separately.
[10:25:43] <brado23> both important imho
[10:26:07] <brado23> i can update open issues
[10:26:20] <jzaefferer> okay, let's continue working on that via the wiki page, feel free to use that to discsuss it, too, via comments or open issues
[10:26:33] <chrisBannon> ok, LMK if you want me to collaborate brad
[10:26:34] <brado23> sounds good
[10:26:48] <brado23> will do, chris
[10:27:00] <jzaefferer> as for collection events, insert and remove are probably fine as-is
[10:27:11] <jzaefferer> I still don't like the name "reset", but don't yet have an alternative
[10:27:25] <brado23> me neither...not wedded to reset
[10:27:46] <jzaefferer> also wondering if it should have a paramter, with values like "sort", "replace"
[10:27:51] <chrisBannon> revert?
[10:27:58] <borismoore> refresh
[10:28:19] <brado23> what would a client do with "sort" vs "replace"?
[10:28:27] <borismoore> It is not going back to previous state, but is an 'unknown' unspecific  set of changes
[10:28:28] <brado23> in a practical sense, I mean
[10:28:43] <chrisBannon> then refresh makes more sense
[10:28:51] <brado23> i like "refresh"
[10:28:53] <jzaefferer> brado23, dunno
[10:29:02] <chrisBannon> So do insert and remove trigger the beforeObjectChange event?
[10:29:16] <borismoore> sort and replace etc can be cues to listeners - like hints
[10:29:35] <borismoore> That can be used to optimize or subclass the generic refresh
[10:29:42] <jzaefferer> does it make sense to cancel collection events?
[10:30:16] <chrisBannon> sure, validation rules can prevent adding or removing from a collection
[10:30:34] <jzaefferer> what kind of validation would that be?
[10:30:48] <borismoore> I think some of the same semantics for pre and post apply as in object changes
[10:31:11] <jzaefferer> just looking for an example - field validation makes sense, but for rows?
[10:31:22] <borismoore> You have to have at least one element in the array, for example
[10:31:28] <borismoore> That could be a rule
[10:31:35] <chrisBannon> simple example: minimum of four rows must be in this grid
[10:31:45] <brado23> another data point...some frameworks have "canInsert", "canRemove" APIs on data
[10:32:07] <chrisBannon> or: this row is mapped to a chil object that can not be deleted without first removing the mapping
[10:32:09] <brado23> "canInsert" doesn't treat all constraints though
[10:32:40] <brado23> chris' seem like reasonable scenarios
[10:32:42] <jzaefferer> would be good to have a application example for that
[10:33:08] <jzaefferer> otherwise I suspect that there are better alternative to implement it, especially as your UI should make constraints like that visible
[10:33:15] <jzaefferer> hide a Delete button if you can't delete a row
[10:33:24] <brado23> yes, I wonder about that too.
[10:33:26] <jzaefferer> you can't implement that with a beforeremove event
[10:33:36] <brado23> Are these invariants of the data or invariants of the particular UI view.
[10:33:38] <brado23> ?
[10:33:41] <chrisBannon> sure, you have to draw the line somewhere
[10:33:59] <jzaefferer> seems more like the latter, therefore a practical example would be good
[10:34:16] <brado23> I tend to agree.
[10:34:17] <borismoore> If it is UI invariants, it can be fixed by UI.
[10:34:18] <jzaefferer> also, you could just re-insert a row on remove...
[10:34:40] <borismoore> But if it is data invariants, you may need the preevents and cancel feature
[10:34:42] <chrisBannon> well, not if other UI is tied to that model and reacting to its changes
[10:34:43] <jzaefferer> which brings up another point: suppress events?
[10:34:58] <jzaefferer> chrisBannon, true, but what does that look like?
[10:35:27] <brado23> I think we probably need an affordance for both UI invariants (enable "Delete" button?) and data invariants (allow >4 rows).
[10:35:52] <chrisBannon> I am not 100% sure they are needed. I will try to think of a real world scenrio (or not) to get a better opinion
[10:36:01] <borismoore> Suppressing events can be like the observer transaction that suppresses the events then sends them as a batch
[10:36:36] <chrisBannon> yeah, supressing events is useful in allowing the dev to control when the model is updated
[10:37:13] <jzaefferer> okay, updated wiki page
[10:37:29] <borismoore> I'm not convinced that UI invariants need to be a convern in the eventing support features, provided at least the data invariants scenarios are covered.
[10:37:30] <brado23> I have reservations about using eventing to be the means of updating the model.
[10:37:47] <borismoore> But the UI scenarios may just fall out of the data scenario support
[10:37:53] <borismoore> in many cases
[10:37:59] <brado23> it leads to consistency problems in the model, if the model can't assume that it's being notified first.
[10:38:31] <brado23> ...and if clients can't assume that the model has been fully updated by the time they are called back.
[10:38:56] <jzaefferer> borismoore, brado23, getting a bit too abstract there - could you continue working on that, maybe add a few UI examples to the wiki page?
[10:39:49] <borismoore> Yes I think we need to some specific examples, and maybe a prototype implementation, moving on from what we started doing in observable...
[10:40:08] <jzaefferer> also, chrisBannon, take a look at the move and objectchange events under collections, we need to get back to that another time, but if you have feedback, comment on the wiki
[10:40:41] <chrisBannon> sounds good
[10:41:09] <jzaefferer> borismoore, yeah, would be good; I'll probably start prototyping the field events
[10:41:19] <brado23> yes, sounds good.
[10:41:31] <jzaefferer> okay, great
[10:41:40] <borismoore> cool
[10:41:51] <jzaefferer> before we wrap this up, we're planning a seperate Skype meeting to work on the functional specification for Selectmenu, as part of Custom Inputs: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Selectmenu
[10:42:09] <jzaefferer> if you're interested participating there, ping me, or add yourself to the list that I'm going to add to that page
[10:43:26] <jzaefferer> so thanks everyone, another productive meeting, see you next week, or talk inbetween
[10:43:36] <chrisBannon> see you
[10:43:42] <borismoore> thanks...
[10:44:01] <brado23> yes, thanks all
