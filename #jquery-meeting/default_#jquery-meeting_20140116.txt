[11:00:18] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:00:21] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:18] <arschmitz> hi
[11:02:00] <uGoMobi> gseguin agcolom
[11:02:08] <agcolom> hey :-)
[11:04:01] <uGoMobi> I see some PR's on the agenda
[11:04:16] <gseguin> hey
[11:04:35] <uGoMobi> let's start with Panel widget
[11:04:50] <uGoMobi> anything we need to discuss about those PR's?
[11:04:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I'm mostly concerned about the swipe one. It has highlighted what could be a general problem with the way we attach event handlers.
[11:05:20] <_|Nix|_> ... or rather the way we detach them.
[11:05:27] <agcolom> sorry, could we have the link to the agenda again please
[11:05:34] <_|Nix|_> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=sharing#gid=3
[11:05:41] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[11:06:04] <_|Nix|_> Basically, whenever we .on( "eventname", function() { } ); We can't simply .off( "eventname" );
[11:06:27] <_|Nix|_> We need to store the function in a variable and then pass it to off: .off( "eventname", theFunction );
[11:06:37] <_|Nix|_> Otherwise we risk removing other people's event handlers.
[11:07:27] <uGoMobi> yeah, I see the problem
[11:08:11] <_|Nix|_> I've changed the way the swipe-related mouse event handlers are attached, but the rest of touch.js also needs a going over, and so does the rest of the library.
[11:08:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would just file an issue for it for now
[11:09:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we have never had an issue reported about this
[11:09:02] <_|Nix|_> When I say "I've changed", I mean pending landing of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6946
[11:09:24] <arschmitz> so while its worth attention i dont think its super high priority
[11:09:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: True, but it's still not good practice, if you ask me.
[11:09:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not disagreeing
[11:09:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed, so we can do this half-passively, just like with this._on()
[11:10:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but you should file an issue so we dont forget
[11:10:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: does need to be fixed before we can fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925
[11:10:39] <_|Nix|_> It shouldn't really be an issue inside widgets.
[11:11:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this does not fix any issues its just not good practice
[11:11:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[11:11:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see what you mean.
[11:11:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The swipe event needs to be fixed for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925 to be fixed.
[11:11:51] <arschmitz> right but not the issue with off
[11:11:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925 depends on the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6262
[11:12:25] <uGoMobi> right
[11:12:31] <_|Nix|_> ... and the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6262 is implemented the right way - that is, swipe is not doing any .off( "eventname" ) anymore.
[11:13:20] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925 isn't a high priority issue if you ask me
[11:13:35] <uGoMobi> so we could let this wait until 1.5
[11:13:44] <uGoMobi> so we have some time to look into all the events
[11:13:47] <uGoMobi> what do you think?
[11:14:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it was documented as just not possible in 1.3
[11:14:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we just said no sliders in panels if you use swipe to close
[11:14:58] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[11:15:25] <arschmitz> so this would be a new feture then
[11:15:30] <arschmitz> so it should wait for 1.5
[11:16:00] <uGoMobi> I agree
[11:16:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: any objection?
[11:16:44] <_|Nix|_> Naw. Let's do it for 1.5.0.
[11:16:52] <arschmitz> while we are talking about swipe i found a solution for the ios issue that does not effect our platform support
[11:16:57] <uGoMobi> ok, let's set milestone to 1.5 on issue and PR's
[11:17:03] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:17:10] <arschmitz> so we will get correct cords on all devices
[11:17:34] <_|Nix|_> Well, actually, hold on ...
[11:17:44] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6262 might be considered a regression.
[11:17:58] <_|Nix|_> ... because in 1.3.2 we let events bubble, so their default could be prevented.
[11:18:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we were only talking about 6925
[11:18:17] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK.
[11:18:19] <_|Nix|_> Sorry!
[11:18:51] <arschmitz> 6262 is a bug and a regression
[11:19:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome (re: iOS fix)
[11:19:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we choose to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6262 sooner than 1.5.0, then I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925 is fairly trivial, and it may be beneficial to have it.
[11:20:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: has nothing to do with how beneficial it is
[11:20:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we documented that it was not support
[11:20:22] <arschmitz> so to do so now is a new feature
[11:20:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, somehow it did work in 1.3 without the 6925 fix
[11:21:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It did work, because the swipe events were being triggered on the element that received the mousedown, not the element that had the handler attached.
[11:21:31] <uGoMobi> then maybe that is what we need to revert?
[11:22:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono, because that's not right either. A sequence of mouse events should result in exactly one swipe event, not multiple.
[11:22:18] <arschmitz> the two issues are really unrelated
[11:22:24] <arschmitz> one is a bug and a regression
[11:22:32] <arschmitz> the other is a new feature
[11:22:56] <arschmitz> and just the feautre depends on the bug being fixed
[11:23:01] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec ... arschmitz is right ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925 should not have been possible in 1.3.2, because the panel wasn't looking for whether the default is prevented, so it would've closed on swipe.
[11:23:06] <uGoMobi> yes, agreed. Discussion is about that _|Nix|_ says we would need the new feature to fix the bug/regression
[11:23:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925 -> 1.5.0, and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6262 -> 1.4.1
[11:23:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no he doesnt hes just saying its trivial after that
[11:23:50] <uGoMobi> sorry, misunderstood
[11:24:00] <arschmitz> ok so i think we are all in agreement then?
[11:24:12] <uGoMobi> I think so too
[11:24:30] <uGoMobi> A note about our agenda document...
[11:24:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: People can .off( "swipeleft" ) on the elements to which the panel attaches the swipe handles and attach their own handlers.
[11:24:50] <uGoMobi> let's only put things in there that we are going to discuss
[11:24:58] <uGoMobi> so we can just go from top to bottom
[11:25:34] <uGoMobi> I don't think we need a list of all PR's that are awaiting review
[11:25:41] <_|Nix|_> OK. Removing ...
[11:25:50] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:26:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: agreed if any one is waiting on a review from me just ping me
[11:26:08] <arschmitz> ill do it asap
[11:26:44] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:26:58] <arschmitz> and as far as status of prs we can just check the prs them selves and see
[11:27:22] <gseguin> Contacted coveralls to see if we can delay the posting of the coverage result
[11:27:29] <uGoMobi> true
[11:27:35] <uGoMobi> gseguin: cool
[11:27:46] <arschmitz> but if something needs discussion then of course add it
[11:28:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: anything about dependencies?
[11:28:17] <gseguin> what about them?
[11:28:32] <gseguin> it's now handled by bower
[11:28:33] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am just looking at the agenda
[11:28:40] <gseguin> so if you want to change a version
[11:28:45] <gseguin> update the bower.json
[11:28:48] <uGoMobi> "one last PR from Ghislain to review + merge"
[11:28:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Once https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6946 lands, I can advise the OP of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925 that they can remove the panel-attached swipe handlers and handle swipe manually, at least until 1.5.0.
[11:29:01] <gseguin> run `grunt bowercopy`
[11:29:15] <gseguin> git add, git commit, git push
[11:30:10] <uGoMobi> is this documented somewhere?
[11:30:35] <gseguin> uGoMobi: nope
[11:30:43] <gseguin> where would you like it documented?
[11:30:53] <gseguin> dependencies.md ?
[11:31:04] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: input? ^
[11:31:17] <arschmitz> gseguin: other projects put that stuff in the readme i think
[11:31:20] <uGoMobi> or readme.md
[11:31:39] <gseguin> well it's more of a developer task than a user task
[11:31:41] <gseguin> but sure
[11:31:59] <uGoMobi> right
[11:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> Core documents it in a comment inside grunt.js
[11:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> Where the dependencies are listed.
[11:32:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah there was a discussion about this with qunit a while back and it was about the readme i think
[11:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that's a lie.
[11:32:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: do you remember that?
[11:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> Core *is going to* document it...
[11:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> I don't recall any discussion about documenting this.
[11:33:10] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: so you're suggesting a big comment in the bowercopy configuration ?
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> hmm ok
[11:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> Other than the recent discussion when core realized everything was borked.
[11:33:23] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:33:52] * _|Nix|_ signs up for a course on agriculture
[11:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Where is the discussion that just happened about bowercopy and committing dependencies?
[11:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> Was it just in IRC?
[11:34:14] <uGoMobi> will this be the same for all projects?
[11:34:25] <gseguin> uGoMobi: it should be
[11:34:25] <uGoMobi> can't we centralize the documentation?
[11:34:34] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: on a commit, let me get it
[11:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: the problem is that nobody will read that doc until it's too late.
[11:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what happened with core.
[11:35:09] <scott_gonzalez> And I rolled my eyes and held and laughed as someone else said "I told you so"
[11:35:12] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/9ac88dea494b0b79d1e1d1d26f8d9f5eb670cf62
[11:35:13] <arschmitz> this is what i was thinking of https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/230
[11:35:18] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:36:24] <uGoMobi> How about a comment in the grunt.js file that point you to the documentation?
[11:36:36] <uGoMobi> and/or in the readme.md
[11:37:10] <gseguin> Why don't we run bowercopy as part of the npm install script?
[11:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're different things.
[11:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> Bower dependencies are committed.
[11:37:57] <gseguin> but in case of a release it would ensure that the right version is pushed to the repo at least at release time
[11:38:06] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I understand that
[11:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> bowercopy should only be run at the time of dependency changes.
[11:38:15] <DaveMethvin> it's really very similar to submodules, with many of the same drawbacks unfortunately
[11:38:32] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I'm thinking of a failsafe way to have the updated dependencies pushed
[11:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> TBH, it's not at all like submodules.
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> did we decide on bower partially because we hated sub modules lol?
[11:38:51] <DaveMethvin> well in that they get out of sync, not in the mechanics
[11:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone who updates the dependencies and doesn't actually test that the update works is doing something Very Bad.
[11:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone who does test and then commits without realizing they still have a dirty checkout is doing something Very Bad.
[11:39:47] <_|Nix|_> Such updates will be submitted via PR as everything else, right?
[11:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Not for all projects.
[11:40:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for mobile yes
[11:40:36] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I agree. And putting the bowercopy in the npm install script would be more of a safety net that will ensure that we never release with outdated dependencies
[11:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/9ac88dea494b0b79d1e1d1d26f8d9f5eb670cf62 is that gibson never tested.
[11:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: That's not a safety net.
[11:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's a ticking time bomb.
[11:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you have tests that are being run at the time that npm install is being run.
[11:41:54] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah sorry but that sounds like a huge potential for trouble
[11:43:07] <gseguin> alright
[11:43:59] <uGoMobi> let's start with document it
[11:43:59] <_|Nix|_> Umm ... how is this different from long ago, when we collectively decided to drop in another version of core, or another version of the widget factory?
[11:44:15] <uGoMobi> documenting*
[11:44:26] <_|Nix|_> We basically copied the file, ran the tests, committed and pushed.
[11:44:31] <_|Nix|_> This sounds no different.
[11:44:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its a different process thats all
[11:45:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but it accomplishes the same thing. So, I think as long as we think about it the same way, we should be good. This shouldn't happen very often, and so we maybe don't need to automate it.
[11:45:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right thats what scott_gonzalez and i were saying
[11:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Yes, it's essentially the exact same thing, which is why I don't understand how there are issues.
[11:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> The only difference is that you don't have to manually copy the new files anymore.
[11:46:30] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: no difference except we have a file describing which versions we're using
[11:47:03] <_|Nix|_> Right, so instead of copying a file, you edit bower.json ... sounds good to me.
[11:47:43] <_|Nix|_> How about a big fluffly comment in bower.json urging one to tread carefully and test exhaustively.
[11:47:49] <_|Nix|_> ?
[11:47:58] <gseguin> it's json, not comments in json
[11:48:05] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[11:48:10] <arschmitz> ok so we just need to document the process of updating with bower
[11:48:38] <uGoMobi> right
[11:48:45] <uGoMobi> comment in the grunt file?
[11:48:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What about "xyzzy" : "BE CAREFUL! YOU MAY BREAK THE WORLD!" (Sorry about the caps)
[11:49:11] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Will unrecognized keys break the process?
[11:49:11] <gseguin> whatever you find appropriate: readme.md, dependencies.md, wiki, Gruntfile.js
[11:49:22] <gseguin> just let me know
[11:49:34] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I don't think so
[11:49:43] <agcolom> gseguin: apparently core was saying not readme
[11:50:09] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... CONTRIBUTING.md ... ? *shrug*
[11:50:16] <agcolom> in that discussion on the commit that dave pointed to
[11:50:17] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: we can have a "comment" key in the bower.json
[11:50:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: right, so let's be consistent and put it at the same place as core
[11:50:25] <gseguin> that sounds like a good place
[11:51:05] <agcolom> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/9ac88dea494b0b79d1e1d1d26f8d9f5eb670cf62#commitcomment-5055737
[11:51:49] <gseguin> agcolom: yeah that's what I was saying, this is only for committers
[11:52:00] <gseguin> so it doesn't really belong in the readme.md
[11:52:24] <gseguin> I'm fine with putting a comment key in the bower.json
[11:52:33] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:52:47] -gseguin- "comment": [ "update process",
[11:52:58] <gseguin> "1. blah blah",
[11:53:04] <gseguin> and so on
[11:53:04] <_|Nix|_> If dropping in new versions involves editing bower.json, then you should be confronted with the documentation during that unavoidable step.
[11:53:06] <gseguin> ]
[11:53:41] <uGoMobi> I am fine with that too but we should check with other projects because we should put at the same place
[11:53:50] <uGoMobi> only few minutes left
[11:54:01] <gseguin> yeah I've gotta drop off actually
[11:54:01] <uGoMobi> so let's move that discussion to -dev
[11:54:13] <gseguin> I'll see you on -dev
[11:54:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: do you have one more minute?
[11:54:36] <gseguin> sure
[11:54:49] <_|Nix|_> Let's dev.
[11:54:55] * _|Nix|_ winks at scott_gonzalez 
[11:54:59] <uGoMobi> gseguin: just want to check last items on the agenda
[11:55:25] <uGoMobi> unit tests, code climate, TravisCI
[11:55:30] <uGoMobi> any updates here?
[11:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Pretty much anything can be a verb ;-)
[11:55:52] <gseguin> TravisCI, last PR is about to land
[11:56:04] <gseguin> unit tests, no progress
[11:56:12] <gseguin> code climate, no progress
[11:56:24] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[11:56:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you had a solution for API docs examples without iframes, right
[11:57:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I mean, to prevent JQM taking over the whole page
[11:57:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah just need to set $.mobile.gradeA=$.noop
[11:57:37] <arschmitz> short circuts everything
[11:58:03] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:58:24] <uGoMobi> and I see we need to comment on the issue opened by agcolom
[11:58:44] <uGoMobi> to provide a list of which widget can be used without page
[11:59:23] <uGoMobi> "memory leaks and broke animation callbacks"
[11:59:38] <uGoMobi> let's discuss that on -dev
[11:59:44] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... arschmitz rocked that one!
[11:59:51] <uGoMobi> awesome
[12:00:08] <uGoMobi> ok thanks all
[12:00:12] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[12:00:25] <_|Nix|_> L8R
