[08:56:28] <DaveMethvin> timmywil how did you know :)
[08:56:40] <timmywil> I'm amazing
[08:58:03] <DaveMethvin> oh good, i still have it
[08:58:18] <DaveMethvin> for some reason it stops identifying me every few days
[09:00:59] <timmywil> weird
[09:02:06] <DaveMethvin> timmywil orkel mikesherov gnarf jaubourg gibson042 rwaldron m_gol -- meeting time!
[09:02:12] <orkel> hi!
[09:02:30] <DaveMethvin> hi orkel
[09:02:56] <DaveMethvin> so the Moscow conference is finalized for October 15
[09:03:03] <orkel> great news
[09:03:18] <DaveMethvin> Digital October is the venue
[09:03:19] <orkel> i'm in touch with some of the itmozg guys
[09:03:42] <DaveMethvin> who else is here?
[09:03:50] <DaveMethvin> timmywil opened the door so i know he's lurking
[09:03:53] <timmywil> in October? that's an uncanny event name
[09:04:07] <DaveMethvin> i guess it's like Red October?
[09:04:08] <timmywil> event location
[09:04:38] <timmywil> perfect, there's your blog post theme
[09:04:49] <DaveMethvin> got to be a soviet russia joke in there
[09:04:58] <orkel> :-)
[09:05:02] <DaveMethvin> i'll need to work with orkel to find the right russian memes
[09:05:34] <m_gol> present!
[09:05:40] <DaveMethvin> awesome
[09:05:40] <timmywil> so I'm really hungry
[09:05:44] <orkel> hey m_gol
[09:05:54] <DaveMethvin> timmywil do you want to update us on the bower stuff?
[09:05:58] <DaveMethvin> seems like it's working
[09:06:03] <DaveMethvin> then you can go eat
[09:06:06] <m_gol> :)
[09:06:25] <timmywil> bower should be working fine for everyone in terms of including Sizzle and QUnit
[09:06:35] <timmywil> jQuery core support for bower is another story
[09:06:40] <m_gol> yeah
[09:06:54] <DaveMethvin> seemed like that had to wait for their release?
[09:07:03] <m_gol> timmywil, do you have any ETA when bower publishing is going to be available?
[09:07:04] <timmywil> right now, I think we can continue to punt that to the components repo
[09:07:16] <timmywil> until bower supports publishing to their own registry
[09:07:20] <timmywil> which is in alpha right now
[09:07:26] <timmywil> alpha-2 actually
[09:07:42] <m_gol> k, so not so quick
[09:07:49] <m_gol> current jquery package sucks, unfortunately :)
[09:08:02] <m_gol> by including the migrate plugin by default and lots of unnecessary files
[09:08:08] <DaveMethvin> ick
[09:08:28] <timmywil> it's either that or commit built jQuery ourselves
[09:09:02] <timmywil> we can ask them to remove the migrate plugin
[09:09:14] <DaveMethvin> i can see that being error prone if we commit a built version
[09:09:36] <DaveMethvin> i don't use grunt watch so i know mine would be broken on some commits when i forget
[09:09:49] <timmywil> scott suggested that the tagged commit be off-branch (so that commit can include built files)
[09:09:56] <timmywil> but that gets complicated
[09:10:18] <DaveMethvin> tho it could be automated?
[09:10:47] <timmywil> it could
[09:10:56] <m_gol> it seems we don't have a policy of including compiled files currently :)
[09:11:02] <m_gol> Sizzle does, jQuery doesn't
[09:11:05] <timmywil> it's just more work, and I'm in the middle of AMD
[09:11:20] <m_gol> I'm personally against that
[09:11:49] <DaveMethvin> i see both sides but would prefer to not add the built files
[09:12:07] <m_gol> at least not in the main branch
[09:12:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: me too
[09:12:39] <DaveMethvin> really we only need built files for releases
[09:12:49] <timmywil> It's not the best, but we're not putting a stamp on the other repo
[09:12:57] <timmywil> just saying we do not yet support bower
[09:13:39] <timmywil> but we will when bower gets a publishing workflow
[09:13:57] <DaveMethvin> well the important thing is that we can build jQuery right now :)
[09:14:21] <timmywil> true enough, and afaik we don't have a problem there
[09:14:48] <DaveMethvin> ok then, let's leave it as it is for now?
[09:15:07] <m_gol> yeah, probably better to wait for bower update
[09:15:19] <DaveMethvin> ok sounds good
[09:15:43] <m_gol> as for npm: timmywil, you wrote the next version will be published, but the next version isn't supposed to come quickly, is it?
[09:16:42] <timmywil> m_gol: publishing to npm should probably include the new module.exports, which needs a version bump
[09:16:49] <DaveMethvin> so what does it take to publish jQuery on npm? we have the npm "jquery" account, i just don't know the mechanics of it
[09:17:53] <m_gol> ok, so we don't have much choice
[09:17:54] <timmywil> just a matter of uploading a folder or tarball to the registry
[09:18:19] <m_gol> I don't think we want another quick release :)
[09:18:29] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:18:58] <DaveMethvin> our goal is to have the npm version and the cdn web version be the same bitwise tho, right?
[09:19:03] <DaveMethvin> so we need to wait for 2.1 to do that
[09:19:18] <m_gol> 2.1, not 2.0.4?
[09:19:26] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we're holding anyone back who wants to use jquery on node
[09:19:53] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yes, those versions will be the same
[09:19:58] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking 2.1 ... timmywil what's your take
[09:20:05] <DaveMethvin> prob not a lot of people using it
[09:20:18] <DaveMethvin> normally we wouldn't make a change like that in a patch release, but it won't affect web users
[09:20:22] <m_gol> I'm asking bc we have quite large plans for 2.1 :)
[09:20:41] <DaveMethvin> m_gol and the timing is far off compared to 2.0.4
[09:21:24] <timmywil> I'd be fine either way. It is a breaking change for CommonJS-like envs
[09:21:42] <DaveMethvin> all 2 people will be mad at us no doubt :D
[09:21:53] <DaveMethvin> let's try 2.0.4 so we can move ahead on that then
[09:22:08] <DaveMethvin> now...jenkins and swarm
[09:22:18] <DaveMethvin> our tests have been failing for a LOOOONG time
[09:22:44] <DaveMethvin> they're kind of sensitive to the server config
[09:22:53] <DaveMethvin> because we do things like POST to .html files
[09:23:16] <DaveMethvin> if we make a PHP file to serve up that content we can avoid needing to do fussy config on the server
[09:23:38] <DaveMethvin> i am working on that now
[09:23:59] <DaveMethvin> so I hope we can get ajax back on track
[09:24:12] <DaveMethvin> the only other fail is with one of the support tests
[09:24:21] <timmywil> I need to go, but reading ahead, I'm willing to take on perf tests, but it would need to wait until after I can get AMD to a good point.
[09:24:22] <orkel> so we don't have to change nginx config?
[09:24:38] <DaveMethvin> orkel right
[09:24:51] <DaveMethvin> when they switched servers this broke (again)
[09:24:57] <DaveMethvin> thanks timmywil
[09:24:58] <orkel> good thing i didn't do that :-)
[09:25:37] <DaveMethvin> looks like the latest Chrome fixes one of our feature tests, that is the only other failure
[09:25:44] <timmywil> by the way, I'm pushing AMD work to https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/tree/AMD
[09:26:27] <m_gol> you might push to jquery's amd branch, what do you think?
[09:26:43] <DaveMethvin> feel free to create a branch on jquery if you want timmywil
[09:26:49] <timmywil> I will as soon as I have tests passing again
[09:27:05] <timmywil> good idea
[09:27:13] <DaveMethvin> ok cool
[09:27:15] <orkel> DaveMethvin: i hope someday we will use node instead of php
[09:27:22] <timmywil> ok, gotta run
[09:27:25] <DaveMethvin> orkel yes i agree
[09:27:54] <DaveMethvin> maybe if/when we switch to travis
[09:28:32] <DaveMethvin> the last item, i still have to summarize our discussion from last week
[09:28:53] <DaveMethvin> sorry it's not done yet, i have been soooo busy
[09:29:05] <DaveMethvin> any other items to discuss?
[09:29:35] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then, thanks a lot guys!
