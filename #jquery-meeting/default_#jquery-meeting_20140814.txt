[11:03:04] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: gseguin: agcolom: cgack: Meeting Time!
[11:03:13] <jasperdegroot> hey
[11:03:16] <cgack> howdy
[11:03:33] <arschmitz> i think this is probably it today
[11:04:04] <arschmitz> gseguin: said he wont make it Gabriel is on vacation and so is agcolom
[11:04:11] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:04:27] <cgack> alright
[11:04:38] <arschmitz> So there is one big thing this week i want to talk about
[11:04:42] <arschmitz> which is pointer events
[11:04:52] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:05:12] <arschmitz> The polymer pointer events polyfill has been deprecated
[11:05:15] <arschmitz> and will not be replaced
[11:05:26] <cgack> wha?
[11:05:48] <arschmitz> https://github.com/Polymer/PointerEvents#this-repo-is-deprecated
[11:06:31] <arschmitz> It also looks like the current attitude at google is that pointer events dont work well with shadow dom
[11:06:43] <arschmitz> and they are heavily invested in web components
[11:07:02] <arschmitz> so not looking good for pointer events landing in chrome at all
[11:07:03] <jasperdegroot> I see
[11:07:23] <cgack> oh boy
[11:08:10] <arschmitz> this leaves us in a very awkward situation
[11:10:00] <arschmitz> so once scott_gonzalez is back we are going to have a meeting about what to do
[11:10:48] <arschmitz> on the brighter side kborchers and i have both made some progress looking into the polyfill in ie8 but yeah...
[11:11:13] <arschmitz> i had it working using es5 shim
[11:12:41] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: what are the options now Pointer Events has been deprecated?
[11:14:09] <arschmitz> not really sure
[11:14:21] <arschmitz> but not keen on jumping to another polyfill
[11:14:37] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:14:41] <arschmitz> we have tried with several already
[11:14:55] <arschmitz> and each one just gets deprecated or does not work out or something
[11:17:10] <arschmitz> but anyway that the current state of things there
[11:17:17] <cgack> lets adopt touch-punch
[11:17:23] <cgack> :)
[11:17:25] <arschmitz> cgack: lol
[11:17:34] <arschmitz> the creator has offered it to us lol
[11:17:58] <arschmitz> but it does not solve any of the problems things like the polyfill or vmouse were created to
[11:22:21] <arschmitz> ok so in other things iv been continuing to work with gseguin on his touch events shim
[11:22:45] <cgack> for that iframe madness?
[11:22:49] <arschmitz> yes
[11:23:06] <arschmitz> https://github.com/gseguin/ios-iframe-touchevents-fix
[11:23:40] <arschmitz> i have a pull request for it to fix some bugs and make it work with both signitures of .on
[11:23:53] <arschmitz> but have a maddening bug need to figure out before it lands
[11:24:17] <arschmitz> nice thing with this is it works independent of jqm or vmouse
[11:24:23] <arschmitz> it shims .on directly
[11:24:26] <jasperdegroot> cool
[11:25:08] <cgack> thats pretty sweet
[11:28:06] <jasperdegroot> I just opened a PR with the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7606
[11:28:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesome thank you
[11:30:40] <arschmitz> either of you have anything else
[11:30:41] <arschmitz> ?
[11:30:49] <arschmitz> i think we can keep this short
[11:30:55] <cgack> i just did a pr
[11:30:58] <cgack> small change
[11:31:14] <arschmitz> execlent thank you ill take a look
[11:31:22] <cgack> I'll make sure I add that button stuff from jasperdegroot 's PR into the navbar review
[11:31:43] <cgack> or jasperdegroot can
[11:32:19] <jasperdegroot> cgack: sure
[11:32:40] <jasperdegroot> but some of the changes are only for 1.4
[11:33:03] <jasperdegroot> because the problems were caused by things we deprecated
[11:33:24] <cgack> okay, I just think we probably want to support both 'a' and 'button' going forward, right?
[11:33:37] <jasperdegroot> cgack: why not?
[11:33:49] <cgack> i think we do
[11:33:55] <jasperdegroot> cgack: oops, sorry, misread
[11:33:59] <cgack> no worries
[11:34:00] <jasperdegroot> cgack: yeah
[11:34:14] <jasperdegroot> cgack: actually I should add a CSS test to my PR
[11:35:55] <jasperdegroot> I made a change in buttonMarkup.js which we will remove for 1.5 and a change in navbar.css which will not be needed anymore after we dropped making buttons in toolbars default to mini and inline (1.6)
[11:36:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah make sure there are deprecated comments to fix that stuff too
[11:37:02] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, will also add comments
[11:39:50] <arschmitz> ok if no one has anything else i think we can wrap up for today
[11:40:45] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[11:40:45] <jasperdegroot> ok, later all
[11:41:02] <arschmitz> ok see everyone back in dev
