[09:00:13] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:00:15] <rxaviers> Hello
[09:00:27] <arschmitz> hi
[09:00:55] <scott_gonzalez> I think today will be a quick meeting.
[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything that needs to be discussed for Globalize?
[09:02:11] <rxaviers> Globalize seems to be moving smooth...
[09:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:02:41] <rxaviers> santhoshtr/CLDRPluralRuleParser is now MIT licensed and I have plural support coming soon for Globalize.
[09:03:10] <rxaviers> I mean. Wrapper is virtually ready at https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/241
[09:03:36] <rxaviers> Other parts that use plural are also coming
[09:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:03:45] <rxaviers> eg. https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/254
[09:03:53] <rxaviers> relative time (which iskren is working on)
[09:04:02] <rxaviers> parts of the number format
[09:04:04] <rxaviers> currency format
[09:04:06] <rxaviers> \o/
[09:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> And for download builder, the simplified package has landed.
[09:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for DB?
[09:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> We'll probably release beta.2 tomorrow morning.
[09:05:30] <rxaviers> cool, our next step on DB is test it with beta.2
[09:05:36] <rxaviers> is to* test it
[09:06:17] <rxaviers> other than that we're 1.11 ready.
[09:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:06:36] <rxaviers> right jzaefferer? is there anything else?
[09:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:06:54] <arschmitz> one thing real quick
[09:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> David Petersen (petersendidit) said he'll be available on Tuesdays to work on UI again.
[09:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> He started looking into the slider rewrite.
[09:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> He has some notes at https://gist.github.com/petersendidit/98d86742827784b4dd2c
[09:07:51] <tj_vantoll> Awesome.
[09:08:20] <arschmitz> sweet
[09:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What did you want to talk about?
[09:09:55] <tj_vantoll> On a somewhat related note, I got my wife to contribute a CSS fix (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/b0e8380f023f41cb4a1bd3665177b5f0e795c289). She wants to get more involved, especially on CSS-related issues.
[09:10:05] <arschmitz> just if we should support checkboxes wrapped in labels
[09:10:14] <arschmitz> we had put it as something to discuss but have not yet
[09:10:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: links seem to imply its ok now
[09:11:02] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: links?
[09:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm....I'm not sure if it's still bad for accessibility. Let's see what it would take to make it work.
[09:11:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: it takes essentially nothing
[09:11:17] <tj_vantoll> Yeah we discussed this before. Wasn't the conclusion that there used to be issue in some screen readers but not anymore?
[09:11:48] <arschmitz> its explicitly excludes the possibility now i just need to stop doing that and check if there is a parent label
[09:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I heard that it wasn't an issue, but I haven't seen anything definitive.
[09:12:14] <tj_vantoll> That sounds right.
[09:12:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did you mean to put "slider rewrite" in the notes? It currently says spinner
[09:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yeah
[09:12:57] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: you had added some to the original google doc on this
[09:13:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: they are in the wiki now
[09:13:18] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:13:20] <arschmitz> http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2011/07/html5-accessibility-chops-form-control-labeling/
[09:13:26] <arschmitz> http://usability.com.au/2013/04/accessible-forms-1-labels-and-identification/
[09:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> Let's review the newer one and see if we care about any of the combinations that are broken.
[09:15:33] <tj_vantoll> "The use of implicit labels to identify an input type for commonly used form controls was not very well supported by some earlier versions of screen readers (pre 2007). And, support for the select form control is still a little patchy in some circumstances."
[09:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the question is are any of the circumstances in browser/AT combos that we care about.
[09:17:20] <arschmitz> the second link indicated the only current issue is with browserEyes
[09:17:26] <arschmitz> which does not read them at all
[09:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> You mean WindowEyes?
[09:18:12] <arschmitz> yeah sorry
[09:18:27] <arschmitz> its right above the word browser put them together lol
[09:18:57] <arschmitz> forms mode does read them correctly just not browse mode
[09:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> Primary for 6.7% of respondents for WebAIM screen reader survey.
[09:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> But not something we test against.
[09:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with continuing to not support it.
[09:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> But if the code/performance hit is small enough, I'm ok either way.
[09:19:51] <arschmitz> we support it in mobile
[09:20:02] <arschmitz> as far as perf its better right now we filter out the possibility
[09:20:15] <arschmitz> so its one less filtering when we are searching
[09:20:32] <arschmitz> but its not an issue either way
[09:21:37] <arschmitz> to be clear because i dont think i was perf would be better allowing the possibility that the label is the parent
[09:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> How about putting together a patch that adds support and we can judge from there?
[09:22:02] <arschmitz> sure
[09:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss?
[09:22:23] <arschmitz> not from me
[09:22:32] <tj_vantoll> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10048
[09:22:47] <tj_vantoll> Sortable containers that are smaller than sortable items.
[09:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> I only looked at that briefly. Does it matter if you use a different tolerance?
[09:23:26] <tj_vantoll> *testing*
[09:24:17] <tj_vantoll> nope
[09:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> The user provided fiddle seems to work fine for me.
[09:24:30] <tj_vantoll> http://jsfiddle.net/9aX8n/1/
[09:24:42] <tj_vantoll> Start dragging a blue box on the right hand side.
[09:24:47] <tj_vantoll> Move right.
[09:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's just because of where my pointer was.
[09:24:55] <tj_vantoll> Then approach the red box right to left.
[09:25:13] <tj_vantoll> With a min-height on the container there is no problem.
[09:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like the intersect tolerance just isn't working properly.
[09:26:58] <tj_vantoll> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8342
[09:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> Close the new one as a duplicate?
[09:27:48] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I was just confirming that.
[09:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:28:00] <tj_vantoll> :thumbs up:
[09:28:08] <tj_vantoll> That was all I had.
[09:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> See everyone in -dev.
