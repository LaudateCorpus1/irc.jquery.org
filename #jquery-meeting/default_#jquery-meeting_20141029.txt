[09:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: jzaefferer fnagel gnarf kborchers mikesherov rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:02:23] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:25] <kborchers> yo
[09:02:36] <fnagel> hey
[09:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything to discuss for button/checkboxradio/controlgroup today?
[09:03:58] <arschmitz> i pushed a ton of updated to button
[09:04:11] <arschmitz> but im updating classes and some other stuff on button
[09:04:21] <tj_vantoll> Late but here
[09:04:27] <arschmitz> so probably not worth reviewing again until those are done
[09:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I think the menu wrappers PR is ready to land.
[09:05:35] * kborchers cringes
[09:05:37] <kborchers> :P
[09:06:28] <tj_vantoll> :)
[09:06:45] <tj_vantoll> I can land it and get a PR for the docs ready then.
[09:06:53] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> There's an existing issue for the docs.
[09:07:29] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I saw that. I'll make sure to reference it.
[09:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> Aw crap, I edited last week's agenda.
[09:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> Hold on a sec.
[09:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> We've got some stuff to discuss about AMD.
[09:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> First is the status of using require.js in demos and tests.
[09:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10119
[09:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: ?
[09:12:40] <rxaviers> sorry the delay, I was searching the issue
[09:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> You have this PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1336
[09:12:49] <rxaviers> demos https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1336
[09:13:12] <rxaviers> tests https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1335
[09:15:03] <rxaviers> about the demos, as far as I remember I had no issue and I've changed spinner decimal as a sample
[09:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> We're not going to have configs in all demos are we?
[09:15:30] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll raised an interesting concern about how jqueryui.com deploy would be affected
[09:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> I would hate to see this over and over: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1336/files#diff-b0d27073828e53773e3cf8881a529b0cR36
[09:16:49] <rxaviers> we do need a config. But, we could wrap that in a helper
[09:17:30] <jzaefferer> here now, sorry, blabla DST crap bla :/
[09:17:42] <arschmitz> cant it be done with a single config file like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/requirejs.config.js
[09:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't worry too much about jqueryui.com. I'll be able to parse whatever we have.
[09:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> The only tricky part might be loading things that aren't on the CDN.
[09:18:49] <rxaviers> arschmitz, user browse the demo individually. How do you suggest using the same config?
[09:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> But we can just hard-code a list of the externals.
[09:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> Or maybe just re-parse the config on our own.
[09:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> Can you update the demos PR to handle more demos (maybe start with all demos for 2 different widgets).
[09:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> And move the config to a separate file.
[09:20:12] <scott_gonzalez> That should give us something better to review.
[09:20:15] <rxaviers> sure
[09:20:15] <arschmitz> rxaviers: <script src="../../../js/requirejs.config.js"></script> something like
[09:20:39] <arschmitz> just load the config as a module or script tag
[09:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> The tests PR has a recent comment from jzaefferer saying that he got an error during testing.
[09:21:26] <rxaviers> Yeap, I didnt have a chance to reply Jörn
[09:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> The other thing to discuss about AMD is handling of minified files: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10674
[09:22:49] <rxaviers> Given the fact next week I'll be in CA for the Unicode Conf, I will only be able to touch this after Nov 9th
[09:23:04] <rxaviers> But, as soon as I can I'll do it and let you know.
[09:23:11] <tj_vantoll> I'd like to see the response to Jörn's comment. I'm not sure why you'd want to use minified files with AMD.
[09:23:18] <rxaviers> This demo/test issues has rested for awhile and I lost the attention
[09:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> So shouldn't we strip the wrapper then?
[09:24:50] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, " why you'd want to use minified files with AMD" are you asking me?
[09:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> If you'd never use it, it's just bloat. And that's the opposite of what you want in a minfied file.
[09:25:26] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: No, jzaefferer asked the OP in that ticket
[09:25:45] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Yeah I could see stripping the wrappers.
[09:25:49] <fnagel> " use the optimizer to create one or more optimized, minified files for production. " seems the correct way to create  production use files
[09:27:44] <tj_vantoll> Well that's from download builder which gives you a concatenated jquery-ui.js.
[09:27:46] <rxaviers> everyone, please add your comments/suggestions at each respective PRs: demos (1335) or tests (1335).
[09:27:52] <rxaviers> after discussing here
[09:28:05] <rxaviers> demos (1336*)
[09:29:04] <tj_vantoll> This is someone that depends on “accordion.min” (https://github.com/components/jqueryui/blob/master/ui/minified/accordion.min.js), which breaks it depends on “core”, and not “core.min”.
[09:29:14] <tj_vantoll> *because* it depends...
[09:30:05] <tj_vantoll> So either we add “.min” to the define() calls in the AMD wrappers or we remove them.
[09:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> Or we rename the fiels.
[09:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say we should just remove the wrappers.
[09:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, I don't understand why people want minified individual files in our distributions. They should be minimizing in their own build process.
[09:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> But years of saying this hasn't seemed to change the landscape much...
[09:31:12] <tj_vantoll> +1
[09:31:30] <tj_vantoll> Yeah that OP of that ticket won't be happy with this decision.
[09:32:34] <tj_vantoll> I say we just remove the wrappers.
[09:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> Works for me. Anyone want to volunteer for that?
[09:33:24] <tj_vantoll> I'll take it.
[09:33:47] <tj_vantoll> Is this just the grunt task?
[09:34:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, tj_vantoll, although I do agree initially with what you said about minified AMD, I have a concern
[09:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: What's the concern?
[09:36:04] <rxaviers> why do we distribute minified files in a general way? We're advocating developers that use globals to cherry-pick each component in a script tag. Is that correct?
[09:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Yeah, it's the minify task.
[09:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> We've never ever ever advocated for developers to cherry-pick components in separate script tags.
[09:37:09] <scott_gonzalez> Developer should be cherry-picking components, but they should be using their own build system and including a reasonable number of script tags.
[09:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> Generally one or two.
[09:38:41] <rxaviers> Ah! We don't distribute individual minifieds anymore.
[09:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> And we don't distrubute minified files anyway.
[09:38:46] <arschmitz> +1
[09:39:05] <rxaviers> user had a bug using a package bower we dont maintain
[09:39:12] <rxaviers> nevermind then
[09:40:01] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: A lot of people do not have a own build system. In that case we would suggest to the custom download builder, right?
[09:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> I think the minify task was only preserved for the bower package to use. I'm not really sure why we need to do that.
[09:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Sort of. We should really suggest that they add a build system.
[09:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> Even using download builder, they have a minimum of 3 script tags, which is still higher than it should be.
[09:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> 1 for core, 1 for UI, 1 for their app.
[09:41:35] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: I'm totally with you but a lot of people do not care or build low budget stuff.
[09:41:55] <fnagel> Anyway, back to topic
[09:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> And those people are probably not using AMD...
[09:42:00] <rxaviers> Is minified files used by compare_size?
[09:42:03] <rxaviers> Are*
[09:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, that could be why.
[09:42:35] <tj_vantoll> I think it's worth preserving the minify task. I've used it before.
[09:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we'll keep it and remove the wrappers.
[09:43:14] <tj_vantoll> And the code it generates does have invalid references in define(), so I think the simplest thing to do is to just axe the wrappers.
[09:43:16] <rxaviers> Maybe, we could change its output: from dist/ to tmp/
[09:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm not sure what problem you're trying to solve.
[09:43:46] <rxaviers> to make it clear the minifieds are not intended for distribution.
[09:44:24] <rxaviers> Im thinking loud here
[09:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone that wants to grab them isn't going to care what the directory is called.
[09:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> You can call it dont-use-these-minfied-files/ and they'd get used.
[09:44:58] <rxaviers> lol
[09:45:00] <rxaviers> true
[09:45:02] <rxaviers> ok
[09:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Any news from Remy?
[09:46:33] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i have not got back to him yet since it seems we want more they just jQuery ui and mobile now
[09:46:43] <arschmitz> i was going to bring it up in the dev leads next
[09:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:47:09] <arschmitz> since we are talking about moving demos and other things as well
[09:49:06] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss this week?
[09:49:47] <jzaefferer> Let's put the theme update on the agenda
[09:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> Is there something to discuss?
[09:50:19] <jzaefferer> Looks like Jasper isn't around. He needs to rebase after we landed the font-size changes, right?
[09:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:50:37] <arschmitz> and probably base it on master not button
[09:52:41] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1376#issuecomment-60960847
[09:53:31] <arschmitz> ah yes
[09:53:48] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: anything new on effects rewrite?
[09:54:37] <tj_vantoll> I've got to take off. I'm also going to get started on an upgrade guide for 1.12 and start it with the menu wrappers.
[09:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think mikesherov is here right now.
[09:55:16] <scott_gonzalez> And if he was, I'm pretty sure the answer would be no, since he has two tickets he's working on right now and they're both still open.
[09:56:17] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:57:15] <jzaefferer> guess that's all
[09:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[11:34:29] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you were working on button, but want to finish classes update first before pushing button upddates? did I get that right?
[11:34:39] <jzaefferer> eh, wrong channel
