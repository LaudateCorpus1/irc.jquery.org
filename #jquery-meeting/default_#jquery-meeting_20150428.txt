[10:00:23] <arschmitz> Meeting time
[10:00:25] <arthurvr> hey there
[10:00:29] <noufal> hello
[10:01:26] <arschmitz> agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit#gid=151548196
[10:01:53] <arschmitz> Dont think much has changed since last week
[10:02:10] <michaelarestad> Hi!
[10:02:35] <jzaefferer> hello
[10:03:21] <noufal> Arschmitz: did u setup the view for meter stylng?
[10:03:52] <arschmitz> noufal: yes
[10:04:02] <arschmitz> it should be up in < 5 mins
[10:04:06] <arschmitz> http://view.css-chassis.com/meter/
[10:04:34] <arschmitz> looking at the pallet PR it looks like sfrisk is still working on that
[10:05:04] <arschmitz> Typography
[10:05:47] <michaelarestad> Good to go IMO
[10:05:56] <arschmitz> I think this was still waiting on something but i don't recall do you michaelarestad?
[10:06:41] <michaelarestad> Not anymore. Probably the lint settings or something, but that's all in there.
[10:06:47] <arschmitz> i see at least one comment still but its super minor
[10:07:05] <michaelarestad> The comment has already been fixed, but it was made on the wrong line.
[10:07:27] <michaelarestad> (so it still shows up)
[10:07:35] <arschmitz> the line im talking about is still there https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/57/files#diff-7b5a3fcfd94771f45fccea0900244670R5
[10:07:45] <noufal> http://view.css-chassis.com/meter/scss/atoms/typography/ css is not working
[10:08:25] <arschmitz> define not working?
[10:09:03] <noufal> because the is no typography.css file
[10:09:19] <arschmitz> noufal: please hold general issues questions for after the meeting
[10:09:26] <arschmitz> not really relevant to the current topic
[10:09:30] <noufal> k
[10:09:42] <michaelarestad> Oh. The ie=edge
[10:09:48] <michaelarestad> I can remove that RQ
[10:09:48] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yup
[10:09:53] <arschmitz> cool
[10:09:59] <arthurvr> thanks
[10:10:10] <michaelarestad> NP
[10:10:12] <arschmitz> everything i asked for is addressed so ill just check with sfrisk and hopefully land this
[10:10:25] <arthurvr> awesome :D
[10:10:47] <michaelarestad> Rad.
[10:11:14] <arschmitz> ok So on meter stykeing since that relates
[10:11:29] <arschmitz> looking at this there should not be an index in that folder at all
[10:11:39] <arschmitz> please look at the typography pr and update it to match this
[10:12:03] <arschmitz> you also cant expect a browser to use scss
[10:12:34] <michaelarestad> I'm not even seeing an index file.
[10:12:49] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: thats what he linked to
[10:12:50] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/73/files
[10:13:10] <michaelarestad> Oh. Huh.
[10:13:36] <noufal> I'm doing some changes plzz wait.
[10:13:48] <michaelarestad> Supposed to look like this? https://cloudup.com/cAE98HulRpB
[10:14:24] <arschmitz> ok so moving on to colors
[10:14:42] <arschmitz> Sarah i think is still working on this since i dont see any commits after her last comment shes still working on it
[10:15:16] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: any updates on the table styles?
[10:15:57] <michaelarestad> Nope. It's just kind of hanging out. Probably needs the ie=edge removed as well.
[10:16:15] <arschmitz> ok
[10:16:27] <arschmitz> i have not gone over it in super detail ill try and find time this week
[10:16:37] <arschmitz> but i like the overall look
[10:17:40] <arschmitz> though its a bit odd right now because it incorperates the typography
[10:17:51] <arschmitz> so its hard to see what code wise is actually for that pr vs typography
[10:17:57] <arschmitz> but landing typography will fix that
[10:18:21] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:18:51] <arschmitz> so all the Perf stuff is still waiting on me
[10:19:00] <arschmitz> i have not had much time for chassis the last few weeks
[10:19:31] <arschmitz> slayslot it does not look like is here for html guide
[10:20:01] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: i assume anything with forms is waiting on typograpjy
[10:20:24] <michaelarestad> Yeeeeep.
[10:20:29] <michaelarestad> Also, I was on a beach for a week.
[10:20:34] <michaelarestad> So that delays things a little.
[10:20:36] <arschmitz> lucky you
[10:20:53] <arschmitz> buttons sfrisk is not here so skipping
[10:21:37] <arschmitz> Validation
[10:21:58] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: has given some good info here
[10:22:05] <arschmitz> but we need someone to follow up on it
[10:22:14] <noufal> arschmitz: Can u issue a PR to me for styling checkbox and radio button?
[10:22:38] <arschmitz> noufal: im not sure what you mean but thats allready being worked on
[10:23:06] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: what are you planning on working on under "Forms" thats extreamly generic?
[10:23:28] <noufal> but in the agenda this is an issue.
[10:23:40] <michaelarestad> Oh. Text inputs and textareas + labels.
[10:23:48] <arschmitz> ok lets change that
[10:23:55] <michaelarestad> And that's it for the first PR
[10:24:11] <michaelarestad> Then we can start with validation styling on another one, etc.
[10:24:15] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yeah thats what i was getting at forms is not a component itself
[10:24:21] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:24:29] <arschmitz> you dont style a form you style the componenets in the form generally
[10:24:35] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:24:37] <arschmitz> ok cool ill update the agenda
[10:24:53] <michaelarestad> I'll also probably do a PR with checkboxes/radio buttons if I have time.
[10:25:10] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: that should probably wait on buttons
[10:25:17] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:25:38] <noufal> Create Styled Checkboxes/Radio Buttons for jQuery UI/Mobile Support. I am talking about this. arschmitz
[10:25:38] <arschmitz> tends to be a fancy button ( for any sort of a styled one )
[10:25:52] <arschmitz> noufal: please wait for topics until we get to them
[10:25:58] <noufal> k
[10:26:27] <arschmitz> noufal: this is also not available to work on its waiting on buttons currently and both sfrisk and michaelarestad have talked about working on them
[10:26:40] <arschmitz> ok scss style guide
[10:27:25] <arschmitz> No progress here since the leading zero debate
[10:28:56] <michaelarestad> Leading zero 4 life.
[10:29:01] <arschmitz> lol
[10:29:03] <noufal> lol
[10:29:15] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: feel free to file an issue on the css style guide for it
[10:29:17] <michaelarestad> But also it doesn't matter at all since I can still do it on my projects.
[10:29:22] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: other very may will agree
[10:29:27] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:29:59] <arschmitz> but thats not part of the scss so if anyone has comments about the scss please leave them there and we can try and get that issue back on topic
[10:30:24] <arschmitz> for the base CSS anything there should be opened as an issue on the contribute repo where it lives
[10:30:52] <michaelarestad> Got it. Will spend more time looking at both.
[10:32:29] <arschmitz> BEM tyle guide i dont think there is anything happening here
[10:32:53] <arschmitz> we are now down to checkboxes and radios though i think we covered most of this already
[10:33:00] <arschmitz> and there has not been anything new
[10:33:05] <noufal> hmmm
[10:33:46] <arschmitz> noufal: did you have any additional questions about this i think i already addressed what you had asked about
[10:35:17] <noufal> only one question. when it is avaliable for work?
[10:35:35] <arschmitz> noufal: well first buttons need to be done
[10:36:03] <arschmitz> noufal: and second sfrisk an michaelarestad had both talked about working on this prior to you so probably never
[10:36:17] <arschmitz> as one of them will likely do it
[10:36:40] <noufal> oky
[10:36:58] <arschmitz> selectmenu
[10:37:25] <arschmitz> this is similar to checkbox and radio execept extremely complicated :-/
[10:37:36] <noufal> hahahahaha lol
[10:37:42] <arschmitz> http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/ gives a good refrence
[10:38:02] <arschmitz> its just an absolute accessability minefield
[10:38:30] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:39:01] <michaelarestad> Would we consider an option styling for checkboxes to look like a toggle switch?
[10:39:09] <michaelarestad> *optional
[10:39:13] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yes
[10:39:16] <arschmitz> its in mobile already
[10:39:19] <michaelarestad> Rad.
[10:39:21] <arschmitz> and is on the UI roadmap
[10:39:31] <michaelarestad> <3 me some toggles.
[10:40:01] <arschmitz> yup
[10:40:17] <arschmitz> iv been debating with my self
[10:40:31] <arschmitz> if they should be a seperate component from a normal checkbox
[10:40:37] <arschmitz> or just a different style
[10:40:42] <arschmitz> of the same component
[10:40:58] <arschmitz> kinda philosophical but yeah...
[10:41:00] <michaelarestad> Separate component even if some styles are duplicated.
[10:41:28] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: well my debate was more on the JS side of things but for chassis yes i think seperate for sure
[10:41:41] <michaelarestad> Ah!
[10:42:02] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: on the js side its pretty much entirely duplicated logic
[10:42:30] <arschmitz> but the css structure may be different enough that it still may make sense to be seperate
[10:42:34] <arschmitz> hence my mentioning now
[10:42:54] <arschmitz> interested to see how the markup and styles transfer between the 2
[10:42:55] <michaelarestad> Worth debating in the issue.
[10:42:59] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:43:29] <michaelarestad> Anything else? Gotta run shortly.
[10:43:33] <arschmitz> i could see it either way but it will be determind by our markup so we should talk about it here
[10:43:42] <michaelarestad> Ah.
[10:43:44] <arschmitz> nope
[10:43:55] <arschmitz> i think thats the last thing for this week
[10:43:56] <michaelarestad> The markup will be identical.
[10:44:23] <michaelarestad> At least the way I've used them recently using the markup you provided for the checkbox.
[10:44:28] <michaelarestad> (but with span instead of i)
[10:44:50] <michaelarestad> The classes are about the only thing to change.
[10:44:51] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: iv done them a few ways some translate better then others for this
[10:45:01] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:45:37] <arschmitz> thats one of the next widgets im working on porting for jQuery Mobile to ui too so timing here is good
[10:46:06] <arschmitz> we should open an issue for this probably mark it phase 2 though
[10:46:17] <arschmitz> its not required for phase one like the normal checkbox and radio buttons
[10:46:37] <arschmitz> if its done it time it can be in phase one but its not required
[10:46:50] <noufal> phase 2 contain all the Jquery UI components?
[10:47:49] <arschmitz> no
[10:47:59] <arschmitz> just some
[10:48:05] <arschmitz> we will add componenets slowly over time
[10:48:18] <arschmitz> and as we add the ones that are in jquery ui/ mobile they will adopt them
[10:48:50] <noufal> oky
[10:49:29] <arschmitz> ok does anyone have anything else
[10:50:13] <noufal> yes
[10:50:40] <noufal> micheal is working on ALternating table styling
[10:50:47] <noufal> ?
[10:50:52] <arschmitz> no
[10:51:06] <arschmitz> thats a new issue no one is working on yet but it needs to wait for the base table styles to land
[10:51:14] <noufal> can I work on this or this is complicatied :P
[10:51:23] <noufal> ok ok
[10:51:23] <arschmitz> not until the base table is landed
[10:51:35] <noufal> ok
[10:51:44] <michaelarestad> It's really not complicated either.
[10:51:50] <michaelarestad> It's probably a few lines of CSS.
[10:52:13] <noufal> yeah I know.
[11:03:03] <arschmitz> ok going to close up here i thin
[11:03:13] <arschmitz> see everyone back in #css-chassis
