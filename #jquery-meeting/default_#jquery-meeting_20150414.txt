[10:01:41] <b-ot> arschmitz: agcolom, arschmitz, arthurvr, gnarf, helen, ianmaffett, jzaefferer, michaelarestad, rxaviers, sfrisk
[10:01:49] <arschmitz> Meeting time
[10:01:50] <arthurvr> hey hey everybody
[10:01:53] <ianmaffett> hey
[10:01:55] <michaelarestad> hey!
[10:01:56] <slayslot> hello
[10:02:15] <arschmitz> I believe sfrish got pulled away so we will get started and she may or may not make it at some point
[10:02:19] <arschmitz> sfrisk:
[10:02:21] <arschmitz> i mean
[10:02:37] <arthurvr> k
[10:02:58] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit#gid=1830382015
[10:03:37] <slayslot> I took up the HTML guide by the way
[10:04:48] <arschmitz> ok so lets start with colors
[10:05:05] <arschmitz> actually lets not since sfrisk is working on that
[10:05:17] <arschmitz> maybe she will get here before we get there
[10:05:26] <arschmitz> so Tables!
[10:05:46] <arschmitz> link to the demo http://view.css-chassis.com/table/demos/tables.html
[10:06:08] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: has been working on this
[10:06:11] <GreatDanton> looking good
[10:06:22] <slayslot> yeah, looks good.
[10:07:14] <arschmitz> There are 2 things on the PR right now that it looks like need to be discussed or addressed in some form
[10:07:17] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: thoughts?
[10:07:48] <michaelarestad> looking at the PR now
[10:08:31] <michaelarestad> Huh. Thought I got rid of the uppercase. Might not have pushed.
[10:08:54] <arschmitz> yeah you also said you were fixing the other issue but it looks like you have not yet
[10:10:01] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: one thing i wanted your thoughts on here was around the idea of responsive tables
[10:10:01] <michaelarestad> Ha
[10:10:04] <michaelarestad> git stash pop
[10:10:08] <arschmitz> :-)
[10:10:25] <michaelarestad> Yep. There are two kinds.
[10:10:29] <michaelarestad> One just overflows
[10:10:38] <michaelarestad> The other drastically rearranges itself.
[10:10:47] <arschmitz> yes have you looked at the mobile ones
[10:10:55] <arschmitz> our responsive tables are pretty popular
[10:10:57] <michaelarestad> Yep. Bunches of them.
[10:11:00] <michaelarestad> Oh.
[10:11:03] <arschmitz> jquery mobile i mean sorry
[10:11:05] <michaelarestad> jQuery mobile, no.
[10:11:11] <michaelarestad> Will take a look.
[10:11:28] <arschmitz> we have two types
[10:11:42] <arschmitz> one toggles columns based on a popup using js so nthing for us to do there
[10:11:52] <sfrisk> And I'm back!
[10:11:53] <arschmitz> the other though does the drastic rearranging you mention
[10:12:07] <sfrisk> (Sorry, lunch meeting for work)
[10:12:10] <michaelarestad> pushed
[10:12:41] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: we had a suggestion for improving or adding another form that look realy nice too but the jsbin died so i need to contact the person who made it
[10:12:48] <michaelarestad> The drastic rearranging can be awkward if in no-js situations.
[10:13:02] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yup does not work at all in this case without
[10:13:04] <michaelarestad> Usually requires data attributes.
[10:13:10] <michaelarestad> (for no-js)
[10:14:14] <michaelarestad> I made a note to look at a second version of responsive table.
[10:14:40] <michaelarestad> I think for the initial PR, we can start with what I have and modify class names if needed when adding the second version.
[10:14:56] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: but we intend to provide css for js only features
[10:15:07] <michaelarestad> Totally.
[10:15:12] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: sure i was only wanting your thoughts on the idea
[10:15:16] <michaelarestad> It's just something I think about all the time for no reason.
[10:15:30] <michaelarestad> I think that kind of responsive table is killer for things like speaker schedules, etc.
[10:15:35] <sfrisk> haha, I do stuff like that
[10:15:59] <michaelarestad> I'm also not sure about keeping the sweet super hacky gradients, but it was fun to do so w/e.
[10:16:08] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yeah the one like you have now does not really work well on mobile
[10:16:13] <arschmitz> but i do like it a lot
[10:16:26] <geekman-rohit_> I like it a lot too
[10:16:26] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yeah i was un sure on those as well
[10:16:29] <arschmitz> i love them
[10:16:38] <arschmitz> but i have a feeling they will come back to bite us lol
[10:16:41] <geekman-rohit_> especially the shadows. neat and clear
[10:16:51] <michaelarestad> I really don't think most tables involving a ton of data should change layout on mobile, but there are certain uses where the other version would be great.
[10:16:54] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:17:06] <michaelarestad> They will bite us if the background color changes.
[10:17:22] <michaelarestad> Though we could make the variable for the gradients the same
[10:19:27] <michaelarestad> I've been thinking a ton about striping. I don't think it should support rowspan.
[10:19:40] <michaelarestad> (haven't added stiping yet)
[10:19:46] <sfrisk> could get weird if you had a row span
[10:20:15] <geekman-rohit_> bordered and condensed are we considering those too?
[10:20:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:20:17] <michaelarestad> It's not that bad
[10:20:18] <michaelarestad> https://cloudup.com/cmf5ZzxXbxf
[10:20:39] <arschmitz> they are just so usefull for schedules
[10:21:26] <michaelarestad> bordered: maybe, condensed: I'd rather not
[10:21:49] <geekman-rohit_> exactly my thoughts, though I think we should certainly have bordered
[10:23:29] <michaelarestad> I think condensed is easy enough to add for the niche cases it's needed by just reducing padding.
[10:23:43] <michaelarestad> Rather than making it a part of the framework.
[10:24:53] <arschmitz> i dont have a strong opinion here
[10:24:57] <geekman-rohit_> agreed there, but I have used bordered a lot, we should have that
[10:25:03] <arschmitz> other then that i would like us to cover the comon use cases
[10:25:13] <sfrisk> What arschmitz said
[10:25:14] <arschmitz> what ever we think those are
[10:25:44] <geekman-rohit_> condensed, totally agree with michaelarestad, never used them in any framework
[10:26:35] <sfrisk> Maybe identify in the issue/Pr a list of the use cases to have in the demo?
[10:27:05] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:27:15] <geekman-rohit_> Sounds good
[10:27:17] <michaelarestad> I do think we should add these additions in separate PRs.
[10:27:24] <michaelarestad> So this one doesn't get too big.
[10:28:15] <geekman-rohit_> Also someone else can help once michaelarestad has the base ready
[10:28:33] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: im fine with different use cases im fine with this being a base and more PR's
[10:28:42] <sfrisk> True, I could add a list to the Issue then
[10:28:54] <sfrisk> Or create separate Issues for different cases?
[10:29:22] <geekman-rohit_> One would do , I guess
[10:29:27] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:29:56] <sfrisk> So we have condensed? or was that a nope on condensed
[10:29:58] <sfrisk> bordered
[10:30:05] <sfrisk> stripes
[10:30:15] <michaelarestad> Probably should at least discuss condensed in the issue, but it gets a nope from me.
[10:30:22] <michaelarestad> Bordered and stripes are a yes
[10:30:24] <sfrisk> (trying to go through the conversation )
[10:30:42] <geekman-rohit_> nope so far but we should make it easy to reduce padding without making anything look awkward
[10:31:11] <sfrisk> Okay, so create two issues for bordered and striped tables
[10:31:23] <sfrisk> and one for a "Discuss if we should have a condensed table styling"
[10:31:32] <arschmitz>  and more responsive "modes"
[10:31:32] <geekman-rohit_> I favor both striped and bordered, I have needed them a lot in past!
[10:31:47] <michaelarestad> sfrisk: Yep.
[10:31:51] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll add those then
[10:31:52] <michaelarestad> Colors?!?
[10:31:55] <arschmitz> the responsive is imporant but should be seperate modules from the base
[10:32:12] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: Yep.
[10:32:19] <sfrisk> I can create the phase 2 issue for it
[10:32:56] <geekman-rohit_> Umm shouldnt responsive be in phase one too?
[10:33:27] <michaelarestad> It's an alternate responsive table. Might require some JS and some testing.
[10:34:02] <geekman-rohit_> Sounds cool
[10:34:14] <arschmitz> phase 1 /2 in many ways is as much about when some one gets to it as about if it requires js or not
[10:34:54] <sfrisk> yup
[10:34:56] <arschmitz> we will have things in phase one like for forms that still require just
[10:35:03] <arschmitz> JS*
[10:36:16] <geekman-rohit_> yup (y)
[10:37:06] <sfrisk> Validation styling
[10:37:12] <noufal> hi
[10:37:21] <sfrisk> although to be fair, some of the validation styling could be triggered via server side stuff
[10:37:30] <sfrisk> rather than JS
[10:37:38] <sfrisk> hello noufal
[10:37:52] <geekman-rohit_> hey noufal
[10:38:04] <noufal> sorry I am late working on my final year project :(
[10:38:23] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yup totally
[10:38:40] <arschmitz> sfrisk: but not styled  checkboxes and selects
[10:38:47] <sfrisk> Nope
[10:38:59] <sfrisk> but styled selects/checkboxes get in the weird area
[10:39:12] <geekman-rohit_> Yep
[10:39:27] <geekman-rohit_> Are we looking at styled checkboxes?
[10:39:34] <geekman-rohit_> for phase 1 or 2?
[10:39:41] <michaelarestad> Depends on how much we want to be mad at FF.
[10:39:43] <arschmitz> they are required if jquery ui / mobile is going to adopt
[10:39:49] <sfrisk> they're technically kinda phase 2, but  jquery ui/mobile need them
[10:39:53] <michaelarestad> Got it.
[10:40:14] <sfrisk> and ui/mobile are going to start trying to adopt this summer
[10:40:40] <geekman-rohit_> understood, I like what arschmitz did with jquery-ui checkboxes
[10:40:46] <arschmitz> that is our goal
[10:40:55] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit_: i did that with input from sfrisk
[10:41:00] <michaelarestad> If we style checkboxes, they can be a bit complex if we want them to look good on FF.
[10:41:11] <noufal> sfrisk u said to me u will assign me a PR
[10:41:11] <noufal> can I style checkbox and selects?
[10:41:12] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: why we have no issues with them?
[10:41:15] <michaelarestad> (not opposed, but just a word of warning)
[10:41:17] <geekman-rohit_> we provide the markup and css? without js?
[10:41:48] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit_: thats correct
[10:42:12] <geekman-rohit_> michaelarestad, sorry, but what's FF :P
[10:42:17] <michaelarestad> Firefox
[10:42:34] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: what issues are you talking about?
[10:42:40] <geekman-rohit_> gotcha
[10:43:18] <michaelarestad> Issues being, you can't style the checkbox element itself.
[10:43:45] <sfrisk> noufal, pick an issue and submit a PR for it.  the SCSS style guide needs work.  the select/checkboxes issue is more than just styling the native checkbox/select
[10:43:52] <geekman-rohit_> yeah, we would provide markup that hides it, and puts in a custom box
[10:43:52] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: right you dont
[10:43:53] <sfrisk> since like what michaelarestad said, you can't style the element by itself
[10:43:56] <arschmitz> you style the label
[10:44:01] <michaelarestad> Yep. Super hacky.
[10:44:05] <sfrisk> all the hacks
[10:44:11] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: i disagree
[10:44:36] <sfrisk> I can't remember off the top of my head how jquery ui/mobile are doing it right now
[10:44:43] <arschmitz> we style the label
[10:44:46] <arschmitz> its very simple
[10:44:55] <michaelarestad> You style the :before or :after of the label.
[10:44:55] <arschmitz> and once you dont support ie8 does not even require js
[10:44:59] <arschmitz> no
[10:45:08] <geekman-rohit_> arschmitz, jquery-ui adds a lot of classes
[10:45:10] <arschmitz> oh you mean ie
[10:45:11] <michaelarestad> The label should be the actual label.
[10:45:11] <arschmitz> 9
[10:45:16] <geekman-rohit_> we should have less*
[10:45:26] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: it is the label
[10:45:53] <arschmitz> your label text goes in it
[10:45:56] <michaelarestad> I'll wait to see the markup.
[10:46:35] <sfrisk> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/forms/#Checkboxes
[10:47:04] <michaelarestad> Yeah. It's the after element.
[10:47:05] <arschmitz> <label for="checkobx1" class="someclass"><i class="checkbox"></i>Text</label><input id="checkbox1" />
[10:47:14] <arschmitz> thats not a good example
[10:47:26] <arschmitz> thats deprecated and been replaced in latest
[10:47:29] <michaelarestad> *after pseudoelement
[10:47:44] <arschmitz> the current version does not use any after or before
[10:47:45] <michaelarestad> i is deprecated
[10:47:57] <michaelarestad> But yeah
[10:48:04] <michaelarestad> That's what I mean with complex.
[10:48:15] <michaelarestad> Have to add an element to represent the checkbox.
[10:48:18] <arschmitz> you consider this complex?
[10:48:19] <arschmitz> <label for="checkobx1" class="someclass"><i class="checkbox"></i>Text</label><input id="checkbox1" />
[10:48:38] <arschmitz> other then having an icon how is that any different then standard markup
[10:48:53] <michaelarestad> Shouldn't the hidden input be before the label?
[10:49:03] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: it can be where ever you want it
[10:49:09] <arschmitz> because thats what the html spec says
[10:49:14] <michaelarestad> Sure.
[10:49:17] <arschmitz> in the label before it after it
[10:49:26] <arschmitz> what ever floats your boat :-)
[10:49:38] <michaelarestad> But you can use CSS input:checked + label to check/uncheck the .checkbox
[10:49:47] <michaelarestad> If it's directly before.
[10:49:48] <arschmitz> no we use js
[10:49:53] <michaelarestad> JS is gross.
[10:49:55] <michaelarestad> ;p
[10:50:05] <arschmitz> not if your a javascript framework
[10:50:08] <michaelarestad> lol
[10:50:13] <michaelarestad> Touche
[10:50:23] <geekman-rohit_> not if you love javascript
[10:50:24] <arschmitz> and one of our primary goals is to be a css framework for javascript libraries
[10:50:30] <sfrisk> This is why I think we should have a CSS only solution, but also one the fulfills the needs for the JS frameworks
[10:50:35] <noufal> lo
[10:50:35] <noufal> lol
[10:50:38] <michaelarestad> We can do both.
[10:50:47] <michaelarestad> It's just a matter of adding a comma and a JS class.
[10:50:56] <sfrisk> Because JS Frameworks need our help, to make the internet a prettier place :-)
[10:51:01] <noufal> agree
[10:51:10] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: that would break our bem conventions
[10:51:26] <michaelarestad> Anyway. Totally sidetracked. We can discuss this further in our issue.
[10:51:35] <arschmitz> agreed
[10:51:39] <sfrisk> Yeah, I'll create an issue for the JS focused form elements
[10:51:43] <geekman-rohit_> sfrisk  we talked of having our own BEM guide? do we have it yet?
[10:51:54] <sfrisk> We need to do that, good point geekman
[10:52:06] <sfrisk> we discussed it a bit in the naming conventions issue, but that one died out a bit
[10:52:17] <sfrisk> I think we were waiting for some results from arschmitz performance testing?
[10:52:19] <arschmitz> one thing i was thinking about with that
[10:52:22] <sfrisk> (I might be lying though (
[10:52:29] <arschmitz> we should go ahead with bem i think
[10:52:32] <michaelarestad> input:checked + label, .checkboom--checked {}
[10:52:35] <arschmitz> and see how it stacks up
[10:52:42] <geekman-rohit_> even a link to some guide works for me :)
[10:53:06] <arschmitz> because we dont have good examples to test compared to conventional frameworks
[10:53:21] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:53:32] <geekman-rohit_> we havent merged bem-components yet, we need that for bem perf testing I guess
[10:54:16] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: that should be .checkboom-checkbox:checked + .checkboom-label :-p
[10:54:17] <geekman-rohit_> arschmitz, cool (y)
[10:54:34] <sfrisk> So we have the naming conventions thread where we discussed stuff, but it might be good to have a quick reference sheet for how we want to do BEM
[10:54:51] <sfrisk> It could be part of our SCSS style guide, but it might make sense to be separate
[10:55:05] <geekman-rohit_> definitely!
[10:55:19] <arschmitz> im kinda for it being seperate
[10:55:28] <sfrisk> I agree
[10:55:37] <geekman-rohit_> i could volunteer but my exams start in 3 days :(
[10:55:41] <arschmitz> because id like to see it constructed in a way it can be implemented programaticly
[10:55:43] <sfrisk> Okay, so on the list of issues sarah will create after this meeting, I'll do one for VEM guide
[10:55:48] <sfrisk> BEM&
[10:55:52] <sfrisk> BEM&
[10:55:54] <sfrisk> argh
[10:55:56] <sfrisk> I give up
[10:56:01] <sfrisk> you guys know what I'm trying to type
[10:56:03] <geekman-rohit_> BEM*
[10:56:03] <GreatDanton> BEM*
[10:56:10] <arschmitz> because with bem it will be important to make it easy to construct the class names with js
[10:56:21] <sfrisk> Definitely
[10:56:28] <michaelarestad> BEM
[10:56:55] <sfrisk> The keyboard is not with me today
[10:57:07] <noufal> lol
[10:57:35] <sfrisk> Okay, so we have 3 minutes
[10:57:57] <michaelarestad> Colors or Typography?
[10:58:00] <sfrisk> Not sure if we can get to much in this, I have the colors PR, but I'm going to tweak it a bunch after sleeping on it
[10:58:31] <arschmitz> typography is looking good i need to double check if there is anything left to fix
[10:58:36] <arschmitz> i dont recall anything though
[10:58:42] <sfrisk> Maybe make the pallet names more generic, so it's easy to generate a demo file of the pallet colors
[10:58:54] <noufal> micheal did u style 'small' , 'code' , 'meter' elements?
[10:59:40] <sfrisk> I liked how Wordpress had a page devoted to identifying different colors, part of me wants to do that
[11:00:03] <sfrisk> especially since it might be useful for letting the demos folder be a means of helping a developer construct a style guide for a project
[11:00:16] <arschmitz> sfrisk: agreed i like the page you showed me and we could easily make that all automagic
[11:00:29] <sfrisk> I started looking into it, but then passed out :-/
[11:00:42] <geekman-rohit_> noufal, he did
[11:00:42] <michaelarestad> noufal: I did not.
[11:00:48] <noufal> oky
[11:00:55] <geekman-rohit_> http://view.css-chassis.com/typography/demos/typography.html
[11:01:09] <noufal> can I help u on that?
[11:01:12] <geekman-rohit_> wait, i see it in your demo
[11:01:14] <michaelarestad> Normalize may have, but I did not.
[11:01:26] <sfrisk> I could create a separate issue for the elements you didn't cover, michaelarestad
[11:01:27] <michaelarestad> I think they're fine.
[11:01:29] <michaelarestad> And pretty niche.
[11:01:46] <michaelarestad> I did style code.
[11:01:51] <arschmitz> ok
[11:01:59] <geekman-rohit_> Yep, LGTM
[11:02:01] <arschmitz> i was going to say i would like code if its not there but i thought it was
[11:02:06] <michaelarestad> Meter has some goofy browsery issues, so that should be a separate issue.
[11:02:14] <sfrisk> I can create a meter issue then
[11:02:19] <sfrisk> if you want that noufal, you can take that
[11:02:36] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: seperate issue as well but in ui we have a JS progressbar
[11:02:48] <noufal> oky.
[11:02:59] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: Awesome.
[11:03:13] <noufal> I will do this issue
[11:03:16] <sfrisk> We should probably start coming up with a list in the next few weeks of the stuff we'll want in Phase 2
[11:04:23] <noufal> stuff and students :P
[11:05:05] <sfrisk> Well the specific list of JS components we need to style, plus components that aren't really JS, but aren't really base styling either
[11:07:22] <arschmitz> yup
[11:07:34] <arschmitz> also we dont need to get everything into that one release
[11:07:44] <arschmitz> we can just add what we consider the basics and add more as we go
[11:08:09] <sfrisk> yup
[11:08:36] <noufal> dropbox and select are Js components?
[11:08:36] <noufal> dropdown*
[11:08:47] <noufal>  we style all the common components for this release?
[11:09:12] <sfrisk> We're styling a lot of base stuff this release, the things common in a css framework
[11:09:23] <sfrisk> later releases are going to cover the more complex items
[11:09:32] <noufal> okay okay.
[11:10:42] <sfrisk> On that note, I think we can call this meeting done for today
[11:10:54] <michaelarestad> I do want to make as much stuff functional without JS as possible. Then, further enhance it with JS bonus stuff.
[11:11:00] <noufal> yes
[11:11:00] <noufal> :)
[11:11:01] <sfrisk> I agree
[11:11:14] <sfrisk> back to #css-chassis!
