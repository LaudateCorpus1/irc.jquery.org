[12:02:27] <arschmitz> Hi
[12:02:32] <fnagel> hi
[12:02:47] * rxaviers on standby
[12:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Any updates for datepicker?
[12:03:21] <fnagel> no, pretty busy atm
[12:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> For the beta release, we've confirmed that download builder is ready to deploy (thanks rxaviers).
[12:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> We think we've finally tracked down why the API site isn't working.
[12:04:17] <scott_gonzalez> So hopefully that will be fixed today and we'll be able to announce the release.
[12:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> The changelog is finished.
[12:04:26] <rxaviers> ywc, I've done few there :P
[12:04:29] <rxaviers> to confirm
[12:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> We don't actually have anything else on the agenda for this week.
[12:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:09:33] <arschmitz> bye
[12:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> See everyone back in -dev.
[12:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
