[10:00:50] <sfrisk> Meeting Time!
[10:00:55] <arthurvr> Hey!
[10:00:57] <arschmitz> Hi
[10:00:59] <prasunanand> hi
[10:01:21] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:01:32] <alexeiTruhin> hi
[10:01:43] <GreatDanton> heya
[10:02:50] <sfrisk> Google Summer of Code Applications are officially open! I'll leave some time at the end of meeting today for any questions students might have, plus some FYI's about what we're looking for in applications
[10:03:40] <sfrisk> but I want to leave that to the end of the meeting today so we can go over Chassis work first
[10:03:58] <sfrisk> so any GSoC students with any questions, please leave those for the end of the meeting
[10:04:30] <alexeiTruhin> +
[10:04:40] <sfrisk> On that note, first thing is dropping source map for generated files
[10:04:45] <sfrisk> which was recommended by arschmitz
[10:04:59] <sfrisk> Do you have any details you want to add to that, arschmitz?
[10:05:22] <arschmitz> browsers handle them pretty terribly
[10:05:37] <arschmitz> so i dont think we should have them in the production files
[10:05:48] <arschmitz> however i think maybe leaving in the non min file might make sense for debugging
[10:06:05] <arschmitz> also we can include it as a data-uri there
[10:06:18] <arschmitz> so it eliminates many of the problems of  normal sourcemaps
[10:08:58] <sfrisk> Makes sense
[10:10:43] <arschmitz> ok unless someone disagrees ill update that
[10:10:49] <sfrisk> Sounds good to me
[10:11:04] <arschmitz> we can always add back if things change
[10:11:06] <sfrisk> true
[10:12:04] <sfrisk> okay, next up is another arschmitz thing
[10:12:12] <sfrisk> setup view.css-chassis.com
[10:12:20] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/58
[10:12:30] <arschmitz> there is nothing really to talk about other then i guess to explain what this is
[10:12:36] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:12:47] <sfrisk> Maybe a little more in depth explanation?
[10:12:54] <arschmitz> this is a site that will build every branch and tag every 5 minutes
[10:12:55] <arschmitz> http://view.jqueryui.com/
[10:13:02] <arschmitz> thats the one for jquery ui
[10:13:03] <geekman-rohit> Yes, would help, I didn't realy understand :D
[10:13:24] <arschmitz> this way with the typofraphy pr for example
[10:13:44] <sfrisk> It's easy to visually see what he did
[10:13:54] <arschmitz> you would be able to just go to view.css-chassis.com/typography/typography.html
[10:14:05] <arschmitz> and you would see the page including the built css files
[10:14:18] <arschmitz> you can also then link to the build css files for things like jsbin
[10:14:55] <sfrisk> That could definitely be helpful
[10:15:16] <arschmitz> so there is nothing for anyone to do for this other then me and s5fs its all in private repos and dns setup etc
[10:15:36] <arschmitz> so its basicly all done and just waiting on the DNS now
[10:15:49] <sfrisk> yay!
[10:16:06] <alexeiTruhin> won't server overload?
[10:16:42] <arschmitz> i really only added the issue to chassis because no one but me that works with chassis can see the repo where the issue should have gone :-)
[10:16:49] <arschmitz> alexeiTruhin: overload from what?
[10:17:35] <alexeiTruhin> building every branch.. every 5 minutes
[10:17:42] <arschmitz> no
[10:17:55] <arschmitz> it only builds if there is a change
[10:18:05] <arschmitz> and its very very fast
[10:18:11] <alexeiTruhin> +
[10:18:18] <arschmitz> we have had this for jquery ui mobile and core for years
[10:18:28] <arschmitz> and those are very very active and popular projects
[10:19:05] <arschmitz> also you can even just paste in a file name from github and it will show it on view
[10:19:27] <alexeiTruhin> thanks for answer : )
[10:20:51] <sfrisk> next item on the list is semantic color variable names.  I don't necessarily want to get into the super long discussion this turned into last week, more of a note of if you can think of cases we might need a color definition for
[10:20:54] <sfrisk> please add it to the issue
[10:21:01] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/43
[10:22:10] <sfrisk> Okay, next on the issue list is the SCSS style guide and refining the HTML style guide
[10:22:53] <sfrisk> The latest Typography PR has made it clear that from a style standpoint, we need to start clearly defining expectations
[10:23:20] <sfrisk> I know there was some interest in https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/41
[10:23:23] <geekman-rohit> but dont we follow jQuery html markup style guide?
[10:23:34] <arschmitz> yes we will add to that
[10:23:36] <sfrisk> jQuery's html markup style guide has been in need of some refactoring
[10:24:01] <sfrisk> Several months ago I added their css style guide since at the time there wasn't one
[10:24:08] <geekman-rohit> yes, understood
[10:24:37] <sfrisk> and the HTML one has been on the list of being refactored
[10:25:22] <geekman-rohit> it is quite minimal as of now
[10:25:23] <sfrisk> so if someone would like to write up that documentation, it would be helpful
[10:25:30] <sfrisk> Otherwise I can do it
[10:25:37] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: yup
[10:25:42] <sfrisk> Very minimal
[10:25:58] <arschmitz> we want to make that much more explicit
[10:26:16] <arschmitz> and add htmllint settings
[10:26:29] <sfrisk> To handle the documentation PR, I figured you could submit a PR to chassis, where we could comment on and review the changes
[10:26:42] <sfrisk> and once it's good, we could submit it to the contribute repo
[10:27:04] <sfrisk> there is already an issue listed there: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/92
[10:27:09] <arschmitz> for html i think its fine to do the PR directly on the contribute repo
[10:27:15] <arschmitz> since its an existing document
[10:27:24] <sfrisk> true
[10:27:37] <sfrisk> separate probably for SCSS makes sense though
[10:27:47] <arschmitz> if anyone that works on it wants feedback prior to submitting pr just ask though
[10:27:54] <sfrisk> also some more details on Code Style Guides: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/12
[10:28:00] <sfrisk> What arschmitz said
[10:28:47] <arschmitz> so for csscomb mentioned there this has already landed
[10:29:41] <sfrisk> true
[10:30:04] <arschmitz> css comb does the scss as well
[10:30:41] <arschmitz> which made me realize there are actually very few rules specific to scss
[10:30:50] <arschmitz> most of the css rules naturally apply
[10:31:26] <arschmitz> it basicly will just cover usage of varibles mixins and stuff like that it seems like?
[10:31:34] <sfrisk> sounds good to me
[10:31:35] <arschmitz> and not even really their formatting
[10:31:48] <sfrisk> more just making sure we're using them the way we want them to be used?
[10:31:55] <arschmitz> right
[10:32:05] <arschmitz> and not their formatting
[10:32:29] <arschmitz> so that should make that task a bit smaller
[10:32:43] <sfrisk> yup
[10:34:25] <sfrisk> okay so if anyone is looking for a way to contribute, style guides is useful to us right now
[10:34:30] <sfrisk> are* useful
[10:34:44] <sfrisk> along with Performance Testing!
[10:35:10] <sfrisk> which there has been a bunch of work happening there the past few weeks, with new frameworks being added for testing
[10:35:20] <prasunanand> I will work on it
[10:35:35] <geekman-rohit> there is just BEM left I guess?
[10:35:52] <geekman-rohit> which I'll finish in a day or two, as my proposal work is almost done
[10:36:18] <sfrisk> work on which one, prasunanand?
[10:36:30] <prasunanand> style guides
[10:36:33] <sfrisk> which one
[10:36:40] <sfrisk> html or scss?
[10:36:49] <prasunanand> scss
[10:37:13] <sfrisk> good point on BEM, geekman-rohit
[10:37:27] <sfrisk> we are enforcing a BEM naming convention right now for this project
[10:37:44] <sfrisk> so it will be important to have some BEM best practices in the scss style guide
[10:38:08] <geekman-rohit> sorry, I was talking about BEM's css-framework :D
[10:38:18] <geekman-rohit> in the performance testing
[10:38:24] <sfrisk> ah
[10:38:43] <geekman-rohit> but our own BEM naming convention guideline should be there
[10:38:54] <geekman-rohit> when I googled it, I found a few 'variations' too
[10:38:59] <sfrisk> yeah, which means we need to finalize the naming convention
[10:39:07] <geekman-rohit> yep
[10:40:17] <sfrisk> I'll work on getting that issue discussions going again this week to finalize things
[10:40:34] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/4
[10:41:17] <sfrisk> arschmitz has provided a link for your convenience
[10:41:38] <geekman-rohit> yes, thanks, going through the issue
[10:43:17] <geekman-rohit> 1:43 already!
[10:43:19] <sfrisk> Okay so the typography issue made it clear that we're going to want to have a folder to put the markup for components
[10:43:26] <sfrisk> (time flies when you're having fun)
[10:43:52] <sfrisk> as part of the pattern library, or an early prototype to it
[10:44:07] <sfrisk> so we'll need to create a folder for that, considering calling it "demo"
[10:44:33] <sfrisk> shall have michaelarestad  made that as part of his typography PR
[10:44:44] <sfrisk> also if anyone hasn't checked out that PR yet, I suggest you do
[10:45:00] <sfrisk> it's a work in progress, but open for commenting https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/57
[10:45:37] <prasunanand> sfrisk, For my GSOC proposal I would like to work on Pattern library.
[10:45:38] <sfrisk> So on that note, we have fifteen minutes left
[10:45:55] <sfrisk> Any questions from GSoC students
[10:46:15] <geekman-rohit> Mine were resolved by arschmitz some time ago
[10:46:25] <sfrisk> Also I can tell you what we're looking for in your proposal
[10:46:40] <sfrisk> don't just copy and paste what was listed as an idea from the idea list
[10:46:41] <prasunanand>  For my GSOC proposal I would like to work on Pattern library. Need help how to implement it?
[10:46:44] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk: yes that
[10:47:03] <sfrisk> So if you're interested in the pattern library
[10:47:16] <sfrisk> what you will need to be doing is helping to create a lot of the UI components this summer
[10:47:41] <prasunanand> yes,
[10:47:47] <alexeiTruhin> I just got to this project. A bit 'dizzy', still. Where (in time, on plan) are we with this project right now.
[10:47:48] <sfrisk> So taking components that are in both jQuery UI and jQuery mobile - that might be marked up differently or use different CSS
[10:48:17] <sfrisk> and come up with the markup for the 'standard' on how that component should work in html/css
[10:48:21] <geekman-rohit> alexeiTruhin: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/wiki/Chassis-Roadmap
[10:48:36] <slayslot> Hi, sfrisk I'm looking to apply for creating a theme for CMS. I've worked with wordpress and drupal before and it's right up my ally. I've been reading logs of chassis-css channel and the issues on Github. Just wanted to ask if there is anything else I can do to contribrute?
[10:49:00] <sfrisk> If you're doing that proposal, I would suggest going through both javascript frameworks and listing what components you will be working on, and any others you feel would be important to add to a UI toolkit
[10:49:10] <sfrisk> look at other frameworks on the internet as well for ideas
[10:49:28] <sfrisk> also a link to to show off your html/css skills wouldn't hurt either
[10:49:54] <sfrisk> alexeiTruhin: That roadmap link geekman-rohit gave you is pretty accurate
[10:50:00] <alexeiTruhin> thanks
[10:50:08] <prasunanand> sfrisk , what about scss?
[10:50:10] <sfrisk> we're currently in the middle of implementing phase one of the project, with phase two starting early summer
[10:50:36] <sfrisk> prasunanad: good point. show off your abilities with scss as well
[10:50:42] <GreatDanton> sfrisk, I am working on my proposal styling components for JS... now can you specify little bit more what falls under this category. I am using this : http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/ as a guide
[10:50:56] <GreatDanton> widgets and form widgets?
[10:51:33] <sfrisk> But if you send a html/scss example of what you can do for components, show us something fun you can do
[10:51:39] <sfrisk> even something like this works: http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BymJer
[10:51:47] <prasunanand> sure ,
[10:51:48] <sfrisk> helps give us an idea for your coding style and abilities
[10:52:12] <Samat> sfrisk: hello! As for me, I am most excited about the website project for GSOC. Could you give some advice about applying there?
[10:52:43] <sfrisk> slayslot: you can help by writing up a new html style guide, adding to frameworks to performance testing, and contributing to discussions of upcoming work
[10:53:37] <sfrisk> GreatDanton: If you are styling UI components, my suggestion is very similar to what I told prasunanad
[10:53:40] <slayslot> okay, will do just that. Thank you :)
[10:54:42] <sfrisk> Find common components in mobile and UI, as well as other frameworks that you feel would be important to a UI toolkit.  Identify what components you would be working on, and send us a code sample showing us what you can do
[10:55:15] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, in the theme-roller, would it help if there are some pre defined themes that user can select and build on
[10:55:23] <geekman-rohit> say a high-contrast theme
[10:55:34] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: +1 for that ui does this
[10:55:42] <arschmitz> and they are very very popular
[10:55:57] <sfrisk> Samat: I would suggest against the website project.  We have greater need for other issues over the website.  If you're interested in that type of development, however, I would recommend applying for creating a CMS theme
[10:56:19] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: yes. yes yes yes.
[10:56:45] <geekman-rohit> and the contrast ratio we talk about
[10:57:05] <geekman-rohit> we could run it in background on checks, and show an  alert sign, if a test is failed
[10:57:09] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: highcontrast is actually a seperate thing though
[10:57:10] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: we can probably get a designer to help us with that too, since I know I personally struggle with what colors work together, although comics are forcing me to get better at that
[10:57:38] <geekman-rohit> and kuler s api is kinda deprecated
[10:57:43] <geekman-rohit> we have to look at options
[10:57:58] <prasunanand> sfrisk, In case of pattern library  components, what about designs?
[10:58:30] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: http://paletton.com/ is a good site for figuring out what colors work together
[10:59:13] <sfrisk> prasunanand: what about designs?
[10:59:35] <arschmitz> sfrisk: they dont have an api though
[10:59:43] <prasunanand> How to make sure the components look nice
[10:59:49] <arschmitz> which is the point of kuler
[10:59:51] <sfrisk> true, just some widget: http://paletton.com/widget/
[10:59:55] <geekman-rohit> thanks, will explore there, also an option for kuler api, for showing good palettes right on the theme-roller would be http://www.colourlovers.com/
[11:00:31] <Samat> sfrisk: ok. CMS is also very interesting project. However, would you advise for applying for Styling Components for JS Libraries. Or CMS project is a higher priority?
[11:00:33] <sfrisk> I haven't looked too much into the live colorizer though, since it's in beta
[11:01:02] <sfrisk> Samat: if you do the CMS, you will be contributing to styling components, although instead of focusing on the widgets you find in jquery ui/mobile
[11:01:13] <sfrisk> you would be focusing more on things you would need for a theme
[11:01:25] <sfrisk> (which I guess is also in jquery ui/mobile)
[11:01:35] <sfrisk> but drop down navigation, pagination, tabs
[11:01:39] <sfrisk> that sort of things
[11:02:02] <sfrisk> so you would be adding to the UI component library, and then use those things you added to help with your theme
[11:03:21] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: they do seem to have a API you can tap into http://www.colourlovers.com/api
[11:03:52] <geekman-rohit> yep
[11:03:58] <geekman-rohit> we looked into that earlier today
[11:04:10] <geekman-rohit> me and arschmitz that is
[11:04:15] <sfrisk> So that could potentially be a good fit then
[11:04:23] <alexeiTruhin> about CMS. If there are gonna be 2 diff. people with diff. CMS.. should they somehow syncronize?
[11:04:25] <geekman-rohit> i still like kuler more :(
[11:04:42] <geekman-rohit> liked**
[11:04:51] <sfrisk> alexeiTruhin: if there are two different CMS proposals accepted, it would be nice if they worked together
[11:05:15] <sfrisk> also if you do the CMS one, it would be nice to see an example of what you can do with your chosen CMS
[11:05:28] <sfrisk> me too, geekman-rohit
[11:05:55] <Samat> sfrisk: Alright! That sound totally great. Is there something I could do before applying or in the application itself to better show my abilities and interest in the project?
[11:07:20] <sfrisk> Coming to meetings helps. I discussed in the meeting today a few things that require attention
[11:07:38] <sfrisk> Also join in on the discussions in the issues
[11:08:03] <sfrisk> Also in the application, if you choose UI component, I would like some sort of html/scss code sample
[11:08:11] <sfrisk> even if it something as simple as http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BymJer
[11:08:36] <sfrisk> if you're going for CMS, I would like to see some code or a project that shows your familiarity with your chosen CMS
[11:09:43] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk that brief  note of what you expect in proposal?
[11:11:24] <sfrisk> What project you would like to work on, what deliverables to you intent to have by the end of the summer, a timeline, any risks you may feel be involved with completing everything, a code sample is nice - although if you have already done PR requests for chassis that helps too
[11:11:46] <sfrisk> Also go into detail about how you plan to approach the project
[11:12:04] <sfrisk> Okay, it's past 1 o'clock, any other questions people have, I'll be available in css-chassis, but it make take me a little bit to get back to you, since I'm in the middle of work.
[11:12:07] <sfrisk> past 2*
[11:12:15] <sfrisk> but let's get out of jquery-meeting
