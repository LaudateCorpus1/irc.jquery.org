[10:00:01] <sfrisk> Meeting Time, wonderful Chassis people!
[10:00:16] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:00:18] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[10:00:24] <arschmitz> Hi
[10:00:59] <michaelarestad> :)
[10:01:12] <sfrisk> scott_gonzalez, ryanneufeld, rxaviers, michaelarestad, kborchers, jzafferer, ianmaffett, helen, cgack, arthurvr
[10:01:35] <arschmitz> dam____:
[10:02:01] <ryanneufeld> whatup
[10:02:38] <helen> hi :)
[10:02:45] <sfrisk> Hope everyone had a good week.
[10:03:20] <sfrisk> As a heads up, we have initial PRs in place for the SVG iconset issue and File structure
[10:03:47] <sfrisk> brought to us by michaelarestad
[10:03:48] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/33
[10:03:58] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/32
[10:04:53] <arschmitz> I think michaelarestad already addressed any comments i have
[10:05:28] <michaelarestad> Except maybe that missing extra line. :)
[10:05:43] <arschmitz> oh yeah that needs to be figured out though lol
[10:05:44] <sfrisk> I encourage everyone to go check the PRs and comment on them
[10:06:20] <arschmitz> i still think there must be an option for it. Its a common enough thing we just need to figure out what it is
[10:06:20] <michaelarestad> I did try various output formats hoping the expanded output would have an extra line. No such luck.
[10:07:09] <arschmitz> yeah i have not looked at all yet into how it might be fixed maybe someone that uses sass a lot might know?
[10:07:16] <arschmitz> i honestly dont yet
[10:09:44] <sfrisk> In theory there should be a way
[10:10:41] <arschmitz> yeah git does not like files with out the blank last line it complains in verbose
[10:11:01] <arschmitz> which is why github marks them too
[10:11:52] <sfrisk> well we'll look into it
[10:12:04] <arschmitz> Yeah this is not something to get bogged down on
[10:12:07] <arschmitz> we will figure it out
[10:12:59] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:13:35] <arschmitz> hmm the sass docs say they put it
[10:13:47] <arschmitz> by default
[10:14:06] <arschmitz> http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_16
[10:14:35] <arschmitz> so it might actually be a bug
[10:15:21] <michaelarestad> Maybe. It's using libsass so it has its own quirks.
[10:15:45] <sfrisk> https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/247
[10:16:10] <sfrisk> hrmm, that was for variables
[10:16:44] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:16:55] <arschmitz> eh not a big deal right now but we will need to look into it
[10:17:21] <sfrisk> well I added a note in the agenda that we need to look into it
[10:17:37] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:18:17] <sfrisk> Okay so the other PR was initial File Structure
[10:18:28] <sfrisk> wait now
[10:18:29] <sfrisk> no
[10:18:33] <sfrisk> that was the one we just talked about
[10:18:39] <sfrisk> SVG icon placeholders
[10:20:10] <michaelarestad> So all I've done is create the SVGs and some grunt tasks to optimize and compile them
[10:20:30] <michaelarestad> I haven't messed with grunticon (which we'll need if supporting IE8)
[10:20:44] <sfrisk> we are supporting IE8 for version 1
[10:20:57] <michaelarestad> Cool. I can add that. It's relatively painless.
[10:21:14] <arschmitz> yup
[10:21:15] <sfrisk> awesome, thanks
[10:21:35] <arschmitz> one thing this does mean is js of some sort to make a fall back work
[10:21:47] <michaelarestad> Nope. :)
[10:21:51] <arschmitz> ?
[10:21:55] <michaelarestad> Generates fallback CSS.
[10:22:10] <arschmitz> yes but you need to know either which style sheet to load
[10:22:16] <michaelarestad> Or Sass. The filetype is changeable.
[10:22:17] <arschmitz> or add a class as a switch
[10:22:33] <michaelarestad> Nope. I can use CSS to do the fallback.
[10:22:41] <michaelarestad> Using a multiple background hack.
[10:22:48] <arschmitz> ah ok
[10:23:05] <arschmitz> we used inline so that was not really a great option
[10:23:14] <arschmitz> but if we use a sprite thats simpe enough
[10:23:33] <arschmitz> we as in when we used grunticon on jquery mobile
[10:23:37] <michaelarestad> I figured out a painless way of using inline with fallbacks.
[10:23:49] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: cool id like to see that
[10:24:06] <michaelarestad> Cool. Just a sec.
[10:24:19] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: oh it does not need to be right this sec
[10:24:31] <michaelarestad> cool
[10:25:44] <sfrisk> yeah, you can show us later in css-chassis or whatever is easier
[10:26:00] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: m_gol: So what do you want it to be instead, return [] for falsey values?
[10:26:09] <Krinkle> (like jQuery#init)
[10:26:15] <sfrisk> Krinkle wrong meeting?
[10:26:23] <Krinkle> I'm following up from buffer
[10:26:30] <Krinkle> Sorry, didn't realise it was -meeting channel
[10:26:39] <arschmitz> hi Krinkle you should stay and convince wikipedia to use chassis! :-)
[10:26:41] <sfrisk> It's okay, it happens!
[10:26:52] <sfrisk> hint hint nudge nudge?
[10:27:18] <Krinkle> arschmitz: Yeah, I'm following the css framework dsicussions as close as I can.
[10:27:32] <arschmitz> Krinkle: yeah i was just joking around but cool good to know
[10:28:09] <Krinkle> So far liking it's movement. Once it's in ready for usage in a small project, I'm happy to give it some exposure in Wikimedia and introduce it gradually to test its limits.
[10:28:25] <arschmitz> Krinkle: that would be awesome!
[10:28:27] <sfrisk> That would be awesome
[10:28:37] <sfrisk> ... fine arschmitz you can say it first
[10:28:41] <arschmitz> lol
[10:30:28] <sfrisk> soooo, on the list of other things michaelarestad has also been doing
[10:30:42] <sfrisk> he has an initial pass of how typography could work if people want to check it out: http://codepen.io/MichaelArestad/full/abbe07c15c81010d04473f341dbcc137/
[10:35:04] <arschmitz> looks good to me
[10:36:14] <michaelarestad> I'd like to add a typography.html or elements.html file into chassis while initially fine-tuning the typography and other base styles.
[10:36:26] <sfrisk> Only thing I'm kinda ehhh about it the use of pixels for font sizes
[10:36:28] <arschmitz> i think thats a good idea
[10:36:50] <arschmitz> oh yeah i think em would be better i was only commenting visually it "looks" good
[10:36:54] <arschmitz> :-)
[10:37:04] <sfrisk> yeah, in the process of looking at the scss
[10:37:16] <michaelarestad> Oh it's generating em.
[10:37:19] <sfrisk> oh wait, do you have an em converter
[10:37:21] <sfrisk> I just saw it
[10:37:22] <sfrisk> sorry
[10:37:30] <arschmitz> how do you see the code ( i dont use code pen )
[10:37:36] <sfrisk> http://codepen.io/MichaelArestad/pen/ogzZEN
[10:37:51] <michaelarestad> Usually there's an edit link at the bottom.
[10:37:51] <arschmitz> thank you
[10:38:02] <michaelarestad> You can turn off the html/js views for more real estate.
[10:38:06] <arschmitz> ah i see it
[10:38:11] <sfrisk> I just typed 'pen' instead of full in the url and it took me to that view
[10:38:12] <arschmitz> i use jsbin
[10:38:30] <sfrisk> I need more in my codepen, there is like nothing in there right now
[10:39:06] <sfrisk> It looks good to me though, michaelarestad, good job!
[10:39:35] <michaelarestad> Cool. After we get file structure squared away, I'll create a PR to start bringing the styles in.
[10:39:48] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:40:12] <sfrisk> w00t
[10:40:59] <sfrisk> okay, so as a side note isaacdurazo has started work on created a logo
[10:41:10] <michaelarestad> Yesssss!
[10:41:19] <sfrisk> creating*
[10:41:23] <sfrisk> wrong verb tense there
[10:43:39] <sfrisk> so what's left on the list was that there had been a brief discussion (a little over a week ago, since we didn't get to this last week) regarding grid systems
[10:44:03] <sfrisk> and the possibility of using susy, or having a customizable grid tool that gives you just enough grid you need for a project
[10:44:20] <isaacdurazo> YESSS!
[10:44:38] <isaacdurazo> I'm still in "research mode?
[10:44:44] <sfrisk> (yay! issacdurazo!)
[10:44:50] <sfrisk> that's fine, I totally get it
[10:44:55] <arschmitz> isaacdurazo: cool
[10:45:00] <michaelarestad> Also, file structure.
[10:45:03] <isaacdurazo> ignore the question mark there :P
[10:45:11] <sfrisk> I figure you meant "
[10:45:18] <sfrisk> and there was a finger slip
[10:45:18] <isaacdurazo> yah :D
[10:45:58] <michaelarestad> We can come up with our own or use another. I'm game for either.
[10:46:14] <sfrisk> O
[10:46:16] <sfrisk> err
[10:46:19] <sfrisk> keyboard fail
[10:46:19] <arschmitz> yeah i guess we need to figure out exactly what our requirements are
[10:46:25] <arschmitz> and if an existing one meets them
[10:46:29] <sfrisk> Yeah, that's what I was trying to type
[10:46:36] <arschmitz> if so we should use it if not then make one
[10:46:44] <sfrisk> because I have seen too many grids with a very bloated grid
[10:47:32] <joebot0101> i'm down for bare bones
[10:48:56] <michaelarestad> I do like the generated ones like susy as it can generate a 3 line or 500 line grid depending on how intense it needs to be.
[10:49:14] <arschmitz> yeah that is nice
[10:49:37] <arschmitz> depending on the use some people want really fine grain control
[10:49:43] <sfrisk> it would be nice if the generator was built into the builder on the site - if we're looking at possible newbies working with this
[10:49:54] <arschmitz> that seems doable
[10:49:56] <michaelarestad> If we come up with an excellent grid syntax and structure, I could build the functions/mixins needed to generate it.
[10:50:35] <arschmitz> ok so in the issue lets start figureing out what our exact requirements and wishes are
[10:50:59] <arschmitz> once we have a list we can see from there whats possible and what we need to do from here?
[10:51:13] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:51:23] <sfrisk> yeah - figured I would bring it up here so we could discuss it a little
[10:51:28] <sfrisk> while we're all sitting around on IRC
[10:51:36] <arschmitz> oh for sure i just mean as a next step
[10:51:36] <sfrisk> and it was the last thing on my list :-)
[10:51:42] <sfrisk> yeah, deifnitely
[10:51:44] <michaelarestad> (file strcture)
[10:51:49] <michaelarestad> *structure
[10:51:58] <sfrisk> oh, my file structure note was you had a PR request for it
[10:52:07] <arschmitz> I really dont have a lot of opinion here
[10:52:13] <sfrisk> unless did I miss something else going on there?
[10:52:17] <arschmitz> as long as its simple and easy to understand im happy
[10:52:30] <michaelarestad> That's pretty much it.
[10:52:32] <arschmitz> its not like if we have a reason we want to we cant change it
[10:52:39] <michaelarestad> cool
[10:53:05] <sfrisk> if no one has any issues with that one, I'll pull it in.
[10:53:14] <arschmitz> its not uncommon for it to change over time with evolving tools and project needs
[10:53:29] <arschmitz> so im really not worried about it as long as its not crazy which this does not seem to be
[10:53:34] <sfrisk> Probably next up for scss stuff would be form elements
[10:53:47] <sfrisk> (well, and typography, once that PR is in)
[10:54:27] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:54:55] <sfrisk> so maybe focus on the issues on the form discussion, since I think we should look at what types of buttons we'll need,
[10:55:06] <sfrisk> or if we just want one button
[10:55:18] <arschmitz> before we start work on anything beyond typography
[10:55:32] <arschmitz> we need to 100% settle the class naming convention
[10:55:36] <sfrisk> ohhh, right
[10:55:43] <arschmitz> which means perf testing
[10:55:53] <sfrisk> are you doing perf testing? or who is on that?
[10:56:03] <arschmitz> dam____: and i are both
[10:56:26] <sfrisk> okay
[10:56:28] <arschmitz> right now we are making a basic set of test pages
[10:56:42] <arschmitz> for existing frameworks
[10:57:05] <sfrisk> okay
[10:57:07] <arschmitz> one set which is like a kitchen sink of common components
[10:57:17] <arschmitz> and one with a single component on it
[10:57:39] <sfrisk> okay
[10:57:49] <arschmitz> the idea is comparing the numbers on the kitchen sink gives an over all score to the framework as a whole
[10:57:57] <sfrisk> true
[10:58:04] <arschmitz> then individual components evaluate the approach to that individual component
[10:58:06] <sfrisk> okay, so goals for this week:
[10:58:37] <sfrisk> Typography PR, pulling in the file structure PR, figure out the blank line thing with libsass, Perf Testing
[10:58:48] <sfrisk> also update the CSS style guide to frown on !important
[10:58:56] <michaelarestad> Yes.
[10:59:06] <michaelarestad> Massive frown.
[10:59:07] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:59:32] <sfrisk> okay sounds good
[10:59:35] <arschmitz> yeah there is ALMOST no case where it should be allowed
[10:59:53] <sfrisk> yeah, if you need it - something is wrong with how you're coding things
[10:59:57] <sfrisk> either JS or CSS
[11:00:14] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[11:00:22] <sfrisk> okay, so on that note, it is 2:00 - see you guys next week? Same time and place?
[11:00:29] <michaelarestad> Yep. Later!
[11:00:32] <arschmitz> later
