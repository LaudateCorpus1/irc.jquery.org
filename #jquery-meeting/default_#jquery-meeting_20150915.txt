[10:00:32] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time!
[10:00:37] <arthurvr> Hey
[10:01:09] <sfrisk> arthurvr, geekman-rohit, kristyjy, arschmitz
[10:01:54] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:02:22] <sfrisk> So my goal for this week is to get rid of some of the copy related PRs that have been sitting in PR purgetory for awhile, that for the most part seem fine
[10:02:50] <sfrisk> specifically, some of the copy related PRs
[10:02:55] <sfrisk> Contributing: Adding information about the weekly IRC meeting #100
[10:03:04] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/100
[10:03:11] <sfrisk> and README: Improve wording, formatting, links, headers
[10:03:15] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/115
[10:03:29] <sfrisk> These PRs deal with cleaning up our readmes, and making it obvious when our meetings are
[10:03:41] <sfrisk> if they look good to everyone, I'll pull them in
[10:05:08] <sfrisk> Also I was going to pull in the [hidden] PR (#109), however it's failing the current css lint settings
[10:05:17] <sfrisk> for unqalified attribute selectors and the use of !important
[10:09:06] <sfrisk> So if I don't hear from anyone on the two copy ones, I'm gonna assume they're good and pull them in
[10:10:09] <arthurvr> alright :+1:
[10:10:27] <sfrisk> quiet meeting, lol
[10:10:34] <arthurvr> ha, yeah :p
[10:10:38] <kristyjy> lol yeah
[10:10:46] <kristyjy> my last day of this project of doom
[10:10:55] <sfrisk> awesome
[10:10:59] <sfrisk> than scss style guide?
[10:11:01] <sfrisk> :-D
[10:11:56] <kristyjy> lol yeah between the project of doom and needing to do some family stuff this weekend I didn't get a chance to finish my style guide edits. But the good news is as I said the project is closing and this weekend I have no plans :)
[10:12:25] <sfrisk> weee
[10:12:44] <sfrisk> yeah, I had unexpected family visit that took over my entire house
[10:12:55] <sfrisk> but buttons should be updated later this week
[10:13:09] <sfrisk> and geekman-rohit said meter revision should be up thursdayish
[10:14:02] <sfrisk> also I'm gonna set up a dribble - announce it in an issue too
[10:14:09] <sfrisk> for a good weekend for the Chassis Hack Weekend
[10:14:17] <sfrisk> Participators will get a Chassis sticker mailed to them
[10:15:24] <sfrisk> righto, since it seems like everyone is busy, maybe end things early today?
[10:15:50] <arthurvr> Up to you but it seems like not many people are here today, yeah.
[10:16:03] <sfrisk> Okay
[10:16:10] <sfrisk> I'll pull in the copy changes today
[10:16:23] <sfrisk> and create an issue for css linting rules
