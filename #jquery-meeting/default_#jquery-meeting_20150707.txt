[10:02:57] <sfrisk> Meeting time!!!
[10:03:24] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, arthurvr, michealarestad, kristyjy
[10:03:28] <arthurvr> hey
[10:03:34] <arschmitz> hi
[10:03:49] <kristyjy> hi
[10:04:05] <sfrisk> Hope everyone is having a good day
[10:04:24] <geekman-rohit> yep :) hey everyone
[10:04:33] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FUdRcAq2d8njs8KAcfQmEyoZL74SXLsLp1rtc7E9z_I/edit?usp=sharing
[10:05:41] <sfrisk> So first things first is the currently open PRs
[10:06:09] <sfrisk> also we've gotten a few hits after jQuerySF, so I would like to encourage continuing that sort of engagement from the community
[10:06:22] <sfrisk> PR #1: kristyjy's Media Query Mixin
[10:06:43] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/94
[10:07:30] <sfrisk> This ties in with our discussion from a few weeks ago to have an easy way to specify mobile only vs responsive layouts
[10:08:09] <sfrisk> Ties in with this issue: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/88
[10:08:13] <sfrisk> (For some history)
[10:09:45] <sfrisk> If people could please review this issue, it would be most appreciated
[10:10:28] <sfrisk> since it ties into what geekman might be doing with the themeroller - if we have it so the themeroller can determine if a site is responsive or not
[10:12:15] <geekman-rohit> so that means the variable should go to our single variables file ?
[10:13:15] <sfrisk> I think the variables belong in the variable file that the themeroller could edit
[10:13:27] <sfrisk> since this is one of the easiest ways to make Chassis responsive/not responsive
[10:14:44] <sfrisk> Although I'm open to input
[10:15:32] <sfrisk> hey michaelarestad
[10:15:33] <kristyjy> yeah that sounds good is there a global variable file now? or do we need to create that? The only one I saw was in typography
[10:15:39] <sfrisk> we're discussing https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/94
[10:16:38] <sfrisk> I believe the editable variable stuff is part of the work arschmitz has been doing on jsass-vars
[10:16:55] <arschmitz> yes
[10:17:32] <arschmitz> and no variables are by component
[10:23:16] <sfrisk> Okay, well if everyone could review that PR
[10:23:19] <sfrisk> that would be helpful
[10:23:36] <sfrisk> we have a redme typo, but that is awaiting a CLA signing
[10:24:01] <sfrisk> Also arschmitz, we have a bootstrap upgrade from cvrebert for performance testing
[10:24:15] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:24:19] <sfrisk> are we good with pulling that in? Or do you want to hold that off for doing the other performance stufF?
[10:24:25] <arschmitz> bumps for minor versions can just be merged
[10:24:29] <sfrisk> Okay then
[10:24:33] <arschmitz> the only thing we care about is that makrup has not changed
[10:24:45] <sfrisk> I can double check before I merge
[10:24:51] <sfrisk> I doubt there has been any major changes
[10:24:55] <arschmitz> its a patcj
[10:24:59] <arschmitz> if there are they are crazy
[10:25:02] <arschmitz> lol
[10:25:16] <sfrisk> lol
[10:25:57] <sfrisk> I need to pull in Comments: CSS complient comments, fixed typos, unless anyone has seen anything in that
[10:31:24] <sfrisk> any update on table styling, michaelarestad?
[10:33:58] <sfrisk> Hrmm, kinda seems like most people are kinda busy today
[10:35:18] <sfrisk> I would like to discuss some goals and deadlines for getting Phase One finished, since having more of that done makes things easier on geekman-rohit for the themeroller
[10:35:50] <sfrisk> However, if people aren't available to discuss that right now, I'll create an issue to discuss it
[10:36:43] <arschmitz> im here
[10:36:47] <arschmitz> dont know about others
[10:37:09] <kristyjy> sorry I'm stuck in a meeting but I'm here
[10:37:43] <sfrisk> Well this is kinda a discussion I want to have as many people in on
[10:38:06] <kristyjy> agreed maybe an issue is the best idea then
[10:38:51] <geekman-rohit> Im here too
[10:39:42] <sfrisk> Okay, well I'm going to create an issue for it
[10:39:56] <sfrisk> Right after this meeting, so we can get a discussion going in there
[10:40:04] <sfrisk> And get other input in it too
[10:40:26] <sfrisk> And on that note, see you guys next week/in the issues/ in css-chassis
[10:40:32] <sfrisk> I would like to move forward with development more
[10:40:55] <sfrisk> we got some interest at jQuerySF and I would like to continue that momentum by having something to show off in Chassis
[10:41:53] <sfrisk> Okay, on that note that's everything
