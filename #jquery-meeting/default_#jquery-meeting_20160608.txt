[12:00:28] <fnagel> hey
[12:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Can you make the minor update to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1711 so we can merge it?
[12:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> The checkboxradio icon issue (https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14955) has been fixed.
[12:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1712
[12:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe he's not here.
[12:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a bug introduced with the latest version of Chrome: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14978
[12:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Dialogs shrink on drag.
[12:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what changed in Chrome, but I'm guessing it's subpixel issues.
[12:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need to fix this before we can release.
[12:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> In anybody even here besides fnagel ?
[12:11:55] <fnagel> this seems a general problem last few weeks
[12:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[12:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess I'll spend this time trying to fix that dialog bug.
[12:14:37] <fnagel> Good idea
[12:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> Compare these two fiddles:
[12:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://jsfiddle.net/spetnik/4w4fadws/ (has bug)
[12:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://jsfiddle.net/4w4fadws/2/ (works)
[12:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> The only difference is that I put the JS and CSS includes in the markup instead of using the external resources from the sidebar.
[12:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> So this is a difference of loading the JS in the head or in the body.
[12:31:14] <fnagel> I'm not able to reproduce this issue
[12:31:45] <fnagel> Just move the dialog around in the fiddle should trigger it in latest chrome?
[12:32:37] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome 51.
[12:33:28] <fnagel> works fine for me, using Version 51.0.2704.84 m on Win 8.1 64bit
[12:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[12:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> Seems to work in master also.
[12:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if it's fixed by https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/0ff7a1653407d2a91cff721528a0a435dbf12503
[12:35:03] <fnagel> I will try this on another win instance
[12:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Did you have dev tools open?
[12:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like this bug might only exist when they're closed.
[12:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> This just keeps getting weirder and weirder.
[12:41:16] <fnagel> Ok, triple checked this: Win 8.1 latest Chrome -> no bug, Win 10, latest Chrome -> has bug
[12:41:23] <fnagel> both 64bit systems
[12:41:30] <fnagel> dev tools not opened
[12:42:22] <fnagel> screams for a uni test and testswarm
[12:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> So my guess is that Chrome on Win 8.1 doesn't provide subpixel values.
[12:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> I've confirmed that this works with the 1.12.0 RCs.
[12:44:30] <fnagel> possible
[12:48:00] <fnagel> Sorry, I need to go
[12:50:14] <fnagel> bye
