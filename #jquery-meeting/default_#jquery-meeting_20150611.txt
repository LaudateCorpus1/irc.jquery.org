[09:03:15] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:39] * jrossi3 wonders why his username is always stuck in here
[09:03:39] <arschmitz> the jrossi's are multiplying
[09:03:51] <temputemp> hi
[09:04:08] <M4rius> my hi ^
[09:04:51] <jrossi3> I think my irc client doesn't close out the connection properly
[09:05:49] <arschmitz> hey at least you mix it up with numbers instead of boring old underscores :-p
[09:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:06:40] <scott_gonzalez> I figured I'd just keep adding you until I got to your current nick :-P
[09:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> So, we have a logo design that a few people have shown interest in.
[09:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/161#issuecomment-109401366
[09:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> Unless there are any objections, I think that's our winner.
[09:07:54] <jrossi3> +1
[09:08:04] <arschmitz> looks good to me
[09:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> Since it has 6 +1s and no -1s.
[09:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've commented on the issue saying that we've approved that logo.
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> I went through some of the open issues and commented on a few of them.
[09:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius also sent a PR right before this meeting.
[09:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/195
[09:11:27] <M4rius> (picked it as my deadline)
[09:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to review that before the next meeting.
[09:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately, we still haven't had a PEWG call.
[09:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> But they promised to have one next week.
[09:12:50] <arschmitz> slackers
[09:12:54] <M4rius> hehe
[09:13:07] <M4rius> btw. i am very open to design suggestions, and should I add a test?
[09:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should have a test for this.
[09:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to see if this was covered by a W3C test before I said something though.
[09:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> Because it *should* be covered.
[09:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> But since this was something that changed after we wrote out a list of test cases, it may have been missed.
[09:16:42] <jrossi3> I don't think there was one. Maybe writr it and contribute also to web-platforn-tests ?
[09:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's my thought.
[09:17:15] <jrossi3> Because there should be one if it doesn't exist already
[09:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> Any cases we encounter that we encounter which aren't covered by W3C tests should be written as W3C tests and then automated.
[09:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of W3C tests...
[09:18:21] <M4rius> Ok cool will do
[09:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi3: Were you able to get the automation task started?
[09:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> Or at least assigned.
[09:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> I know you mentioned possibly getting jdalton to lead that.
[09:21:12] <jrossi3> I was expecting jdalton and another guy on our team (Alex Lu) to join us today, but they're MIA i think
[09:21:34] <jrossi3> But yes they will work on this
[09:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[09:24:50] <jrossi3> I failed to get to PR 168 this week
[09:25:10] <jrossi3> I'd like some guidance on review criteria
[09:25:29] <arschmitz> Might be worth mentioned the folks now working on hammer.js are interested in working together on https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/151
[09:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: That'd be great.
[09:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi3: What kind of guidance are you looking for?
[09:26:15] <jrossi3> Besides technical accuracy, code style guidelines, and adding tests when needed....anything thing else I should look for?
[09:26:24] <jdalton> word
[09:26:34] * jrossi3 waves
[09:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds about right to me.
[09:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> And style should be automatically checked by Grunt.
[09:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically by JSCS.
[09:27:09] <jrossi3> Yep
[09:27:38] <jrossi3> cool, I'll look through it today
[09:27:50] <jrossi3> *fingers crossed*
[09:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember if I mentioned this when I added it, but `grunt jscs:fix` will actually update the files to conform to the style guide.
[09:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> At least for most things.
[09:28:09] <jrossi3> That's sorcery right there
[09:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's currently limited to whitespace only changes, but that's like 90% of the style rules.
[09:28:49] <jdalton> nice!
[09:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> jdalton: Have you had a chance to look at the existing test automation in PEP?
[09:30:33] * jrossi3 waves at alxlu
[09:30:59] <jdalton> I've looked at the w3c tests but haven't gotten to integration with PEP
[09:31:35] <jdalton> *more than looked, gotten it up and running and seeing what we're up against
[09:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> Great.
[09:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> If you have any questions, just ping me in #pep.
[09:32:35] <jdalton> Ahh nice!
[09:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:34:28] <jrossi3> What do people think about adding pressure support from the force touch apis?
[09:35:07] <jrossi3> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/194
[09:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a good idea. I was going to look into it since I just got a new MBP.
[09:35:56] <arschmitz> makes sense to me
[09:36:09] <jrossi3> Yeah I don't have hardware at the moment
[09:36:44] <scott_gonzalez> Microsoft doesn't have a pile of new Apple hardware just sitting around in their offices?!?
[09:37:53] <jrossi3> Oh we do, but they're mostly for office space reenactments
[09:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:38:09] <jrossi3> Force touched a bit too hard i guess
[09:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess that's all for today.
[09:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:39:55] <jrossi3> 'Later dudes
[11:01:11] <arschmitz> apsdehal: agcolom cgack gabrielschulhof jasperdegroot sfrisk arthurvr Meeting time!
[11:01:21] <arthurvr> hey there
[11:01:29] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:01:30] <apsdehal> hey
[11:01:32] <cgack> Howdy
[11:01:50] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[11:03:33] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=1272707525
[11:03:35] <arschmitz> agnda
[11:05:01] <arschmitz> Ok lets get started
[11:05:12] <arschmitz> 1.5-dev is now up to date with master
[11:05:22] <arschmitz> that was a big job
[11:06:04] <arschmitz> Lets try to land all big prs on 1.5-dev from now on
[11:06:07] <gabrielschulhof> There's only that rangeslider backcompat test failure ...
[11:06:08] <arschmitz> to avoid this in the future
[11:06:18] <arschmitz> cgack: any word on that?
[11:06:40] <cgack> unfortunately no, I've not had time to look at anything this week
[11:06:46] <gabrielschulhof> Wait - isn't that what you meant by having blown up the rebase?
[11:06:59] <arschmitz> no
[11:07:10] <arschmitz> in cgack's rebase with 1.5-dev
[11:07:19] <arschmitz> not in the rebase with 1.5-dev and master
[11:08:13] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, you need me to rebase my PRs wrt. the new 1.5-dev!
[11:08:41] <arschmitz> yes
[11:08:59] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Gotcha. Can do.
[11:09:34] <arschmitz> so the theme pr is basicly all update
[11:09:42] <arschmitz> i have one annoying test failing i need to figure out
[11:10:50] <cgack> @arschmitz did the changes you were going to make to the backcompat help fix anything wrt the Rangeslider changes you had me push? or have they landed yet
[11:11:08] <arschmitz> thats the pr i was just talking about
[11:11:45] <cgack> so once it lands we might be green?
[11:11:49] <arschmitz> no
[11:11:56] <arschmitz> that was just the mini issue
[11:12:02] <arschmitz> not the rest
[11:12:12] <cgack> alright. I'll dig into highlight
[11:12:20] <arschmitz> thank you
[11:12:23] <gabrielschulhof> Excellent!
[11:13:07] <arschmitz> so in working on finishing the improved enhancer
[11:13:14] <arschmitz> i realized something pretty awesome
[11:13:34] <arschmitz> on very complex pages the enhancer is actually faster then the traditional seperate calls
[11:14:03] <arschmitz> the perf penalty is now nearly non existent if you have more then a few widget and as you add more it actually has a benefit
[11:14:12] <arschmitz> because it only runs a single selector per page
[11:14:29] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, nice! And it passes them all into the widget factory at once. Nice!
[11:14:31] <arschmitz> and if you add ids agressively caches options and roles
[11:14:37] <gabrielschulhof> The .each() in there actually has some use :)
[11:15:03] <arschmitz> remember this can now also run custom code and jquery plugins
[11:15:13] <arschmitz> so "not just widgets anymore"
[11:15:30] <arschmitz> its anything you do when a page is loaded
[11:18:03] <arschmitz> ok so gabrielschulhof where did you leave off on download builder?
[11:18:42] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I shelved it for now. I have waaay too much on my plate.
[11:18:55] <arschmitz> ok
[11:18:59] <gabrielschulhof> I'm sorry to say ...
[11:19:01] <arschmitz> where did you leave off though
[11:19:19] <arschmitz> like did you actually start implementation
[11:19:23] <arschmitz> or did you just look into it
[11:19:44] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, it was pretty preliminary.
[11:19:48] <arschmitz> ok
[11:20:11] <gabrielschulhof> I was about to add it to the build, just trying to thread our build process through it.
[11:20:20] <arschmitz> ok
[11:20:25] <gabrielschulhof> ... but it's fairly UI-oriented.
[11:20:42] <arschmitz> not trying to rush just rxaviers is getting ready to start work again so i wanted to know where we are at with it
[11:21:06] <arschmitz> want to get stuff for beta first
[11:21:33] <jasperdegroot> is this a blocker for our 1.5 alpha?
[11:21:34] <arschmitz> if we cant do custom downloads on the very first alpha of 1.5 i think we can live with that
[11:21:37] <gabrielschulhof> Lemme make sure I get the big picture straight: We still produce everything we currently produce in dist/ but we use DB to do it - ight?
[11:21:47] <arschmitz> as long as we get it done for beta probably i think we are ok
[11:21:58] <arschmitz> essentially
[11:22:00] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:22:17] <arschmitz> i dont think it needs to be 100% the same as long as we are ok with the new package
[11:22:25] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[11:22:34] <arschmitz> but i think the new ui builder is actually modeled after out package
[11:22:46] <arschmitz> the old one was very different
[11:23:12] <gabrielschulhof> *sigh* ... there's another problem ... I'm going on vacation for two weeks ...
[11:23:23] <arschmitz> ok
[11:23:44] <cgack>  have a great vacation!
[11:23:45] <arschmitz> we do what we can
[11:23:50] <gabrielschulhof> I've got until Tuesday to cram in as much as possible.
[11:23:59] <arschmitz> so anything you have will just have to wait lol
[11:24:15] <gabrielschulhof> ... and since I'm not going to any exotic place (Hamilton, Ontario), I might be able to look in occasionally.
[11:24:24] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i think selectmenu is the most important widget your working on fyi
[11:25:04] <gabrielschulhof> The page classes PR actually touches that too, because it gets rid of the dialog widget.
[11:25:10] <arschmitz> but id rather see anything really close land first and clean up your plate
[11:25:28] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. I'd like to land popup and page, but they both need the theme extension.
[11:25:41] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: want to look it over again
[11:25:53] <arschmitz> aside from fixiing the one test it addresses everything you commented on
[11:26:07] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Did you rebase it wrt. the latest 1.5-dev?
[11:26:11] <arschmitz> and the test seems unrelated so im not sure
[11:26:13] <arschmitz> yes
[11:26:27] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[11:26:56] <arschmitz> its about active class on form reset button being removed?
[11:27:01] <arschmitz> so kinda odd
[11:27:04] <arschmitz> anyway
[11:27:51] <arschmitz> cgack: your working on toolbar next or navbar?
[11:28:17] <cgack> probably slider actually, then those others, unless someone else already grabbed slider
[11:28:23] <arschmitz> ah right
[11:28:36] <arschmitz> slider should be next since we already did rangeslider makes sense
[11:29:02] <cgack> okay, then I'll hit toolbar after that most likely since its already half way there
[11:29:12] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:29:24] <arschmitz> half the work there is in the delete key ha ha ha
[11:29:31] <arschmitz> best kind
[11:29:39] <cgack> indeed
[11:30:20] <arschmitz> ok so there is something that i have talked to most of you a little bit about before but i would like to discuss
[11:30:33] <arschmitz> which is the possibility of collaboration with Hammer.js
[11:30:47] <arschmitz> to replace our current touch events
[11:30:56] <arschmitz> like swipe tap taphhold
[11:31:16] <gabrielschulhof> Why not simply yank them and tell people to use hammer.js?
[11:31:24] <gabrielschulhof> Is it not drop-in?
[11:31:26] <arschmitz> http://hammerjs.github.io/
[11:31:41] <arschmitz> well we have internal dependencies
[11:31:52] <arschmitz> so this would become a dependency
[11:31:59] <arschmitz> if we go that route
[11:32:40] <arschmitz> however the current build is only 3.5k and has a lot more supported gestures
[11:33:02] <arschmitz> but the idea i think would be to work with them on a v3 of hammer
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> that we would pull in as a dependency
[11:33:30] <arschmitz> there are differences between our implementations
[11:33:36] <arschmitz> so we would need a deprecation period
[11:34:34] <arschmitz> they support things like pinch, zoom, rotate, pan
[11:34:47] <jasperdegroot> what reasoning? what they support works better?
[11:34:57] <jasperdegroot> what is*
[11:35:07] <arschmitz> Well collaboration is always good
[11:35:15] <arschmitz> its not good to duplicate effort
[11:35:20] <arschmitz> they also do work better
[11:35:27] <jasperdegroot> agreed
[11:35:31] <arschmitz> because they polyfill touch action
[11:35:33] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, a lot of our events do not properly keep context.
[11:35:41] <arschmitz> to make things liek swipe work properly on old android where we cant
[11:35:49] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:36:01] <arschmitz> and this is a full gesture recognition library
[11:36:09] <jasperdegroot> sounds good
[11:36:22] <cgack> +1
[11:36:25] <arschmitz> and its extendable with modular recognizers
[11:36:37] <arschmitz> there is also talk for collaboration with pep
[11:36:49] <arschmitz> to share the polyfill for touch-action
[11:36:55] <arschmitz> and do a pointer only build
[11:37:11] <arschmitz> Hammer is also very popular
[11:37:15] <arschmitz> its on more websites the JQM
[11:37:25] <arschmitz> and its very well liked
[11:37:36] <arschmitz> we have had a bunch of issues about interoperability with them
[11:38:47] <gabrielschulhof> So, correct me if I'm wrong. When Chrome ships pointer events, we'll only need PEP for old browsers, right?
[11:39:00] <arschmitz> all versions of safari
[11:39:15] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, crap! That's right ...
[11:39:27] <arschmitz> and firefox does not yet
[11:39:34] <arschmitz> but they will likely beat chrome
[11:40:22] <arschmitz> so we will need it for a while
[11:40:55] <gabrielschulhof> OK, but we should definitely build on top of it.
[11:41:04] <arschmitz> yes of course
[11:41:04] <gabrielschulhof> We should forget we've ever had mouse/touch.
[11:41:09] <arschmitz> we decided that a long time ago
[11:41:25] <arschmitz> thats why we are using pep
[11:42:57] <arschmitz> ok so is there anyone that does not think pursueing collaboration with hammer is where we should look?
[11:43:19] <arschmitz> oh before any one answers lol
[11:43:25] <arschmitz> incase it makes a difference
[11:43:34] <arschmitz> I am also now the project lead of Hammer.js
[11:43:43] <jasperdegroot> oh nice
[11:44:07] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that should definitely be a breath of fresh air for our events.
[11:44:21] <arschmitz> yes and its we have to directly maintain
[11:44:55] <arschmitz> and i think both testing and the community have shown the prefer the hammer approach
[11:45:19] <arschmitz> its also what ionic, ember touch and angular touch use
[11:45:27] <cgack> I'm for it
[11:45:32] <jasperdegroot> me too
[11:45:34] <gabrielschulhof> Same here.
[11:45:52] <arschmitz> rick byers from google and jacob rossie from microsoft have agreed to help with hammer as well
[11:46:03] <arschmitz> so has the creator of ember touch
[11:46:49] <arschmitz> ok
[11:46:56] <arschmitz> im going to open an issue for it then
[11:47:17] <arschmitz> we can track everything about when and how this will work there
[11:47:42] <arschmitz> oh also
[11:47:51] <arschmitz> i think gabrielschulhof already fixed any compat issues
[11:48:09] <arschmitz> so you can already use hammer with a custom 1.4.5 build ( or maybe master ) build
[11:48:09] <gabrielschulhof> I did what?
[11:48:29] <jasperdegroot> always nice when you fix things without even knowing it ;)
[11:48:35] <gabrielschulhof> I know, eh?
[11:49:10] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7805
[11:49:12] <gabrielschulhof> It's like, "Oh, sorry! Did I fix that? Oh well ... "
[11:49:22] <arschmitz> nah this was pretty intentional
[11:50:32] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, that? Right ... I had to split, like, swipe, or scroll, or something out of the touch events, or something like that, so you can do a custom build without it.
[11:50:50] <gabrielschulhof> ... and use hammer instead.
[11:50:55] <arschmitz> init was requireing swipe or something crazy
[11:51:03] <arschmitz> because it needed scrollstop i thin
[11:51:51] <arschmitz> so you could not use a custom build without swipe
[11:52:19] <gabrielschulhof> Right, yeah ...
[11:53:08] <gabrielschulhof> Anyhoo ... glad that's behind us.
[11:53:09] <arschmitz> so i think this will be a positive move for us
[11:53:52] <arschmitz> there is also a lot of talk over there about a better way to do fast click that is looking promising
[11:54:53] <jasperdegroot> does hammer.js currently include anything like fastclick or not?
[11:55:00] <arschmitz> it has tap
[11:55:08] <arschmitz> which is often used as a fast click
[11:55:24] <arschmitz> but what this does
[11:55:32] <arschmitz> is polyfills touch-action="none"
[11:55:46] <arschmitz> and just removes the delay on the actual click event
[11:56:00] <arschmitz> so it avoids most of the problems with traditional fast clicks
[11:56:10] <jasperdegroot> i see
[11:56:54] <arschmitz> i have a jsbin demo but jsbin is not loading
[11:57:16] <agcolom> Hi, sorry only just got back!
[11:57:27] <arschmitz> agcolom: Hi
[11:57:48] <gabrielschulhof> agcolom: Hey!
[11:57:48] <arschmitz> agcolom: the main topic has been the idea of collaboratiing with Hammer.js
[11:58:26] <agcolom> OK,
[11:58:38] <arschmitz> they are a gesture library
[11:58:44] <arschmitz> and would replace our touch events
[11:58:51] * agcolom reads up on Hammer.js
[11:58:58] <arschmitz> http://hammerjs.github.io/
[11:59:30] <arschmitz> they overlap a lot with parts of jqm
[11:59:49] <agcolom> interesting!
[12:00:14] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: http://jsbin.com/pisake/5/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:00:25] <arschmitz> thats demoing the approach to fast click
[12:00:42] <jasperdegroot> ok thanks
[12:01:05] <arschmitz> its very very simple
[12:01:08] <arschmitz> no jquery
[12:01:57] <arschmitz> it also avoids the need for heuristics execpt on ios 8 because of the crazy new native fast click
[12:02:28] <jasperdegroot> ah right :(
[12:02:43] <arschmitz> returning false when it reaches that does nothing
[12:03:00] <arschmitz> so you need to make sure you dont do anything and let the native one happen
[12:03:40] <arschmitz> oh one big thing with hammer we dont do
[12:03:46] <arschmitz> is support multi touch
[12:08:49] <arschmitz> ok so we are over on time
[12:08:58] <arschmitz> is there anything else any one wants to discuss?
[12:09:33] <jasperdegroot> I am good
[12:10:30] <cgack> same
[12:11:26] <arschmitz> ok
[12:11:33] <arschmitz> see every one back on dev then
