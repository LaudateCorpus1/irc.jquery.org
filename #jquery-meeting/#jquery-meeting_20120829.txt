[09:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> MEETING!
[09:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> We're making really good progress on docs.
[09:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> I've written docs for a lot of stuff that wasn't previously documented.
[09:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> And fleshed out some of the other docs.
[09:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> XSL is starting to settle down.
[09:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers has been working on the design implementation.
[09:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> So the site is actually starting to look good :-)
[09:02:10] <kborchers> sample http://cl.ly/image/2q1Y2h2P2L1n
[09:02:39] <jzaefferer> ping gnarf rxaviers
[09:03:16] * rxaviers here
[09:04:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: are we still looking for more design?
[09:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I pinged the designers about that today.
[09:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> They're still working on it.
[09:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why it's taking so long.
[09:06:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, kborchers, Question about design vs. download builder: are there any new design for it? So far, it's been developed based on previous (current actually) styles.
[09:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We don't have a design for it yet.
[09:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> Right now we're mostly concerned with functionality.
[09:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> We can always make pages prettier later.
[09:08:18] <rxaviers> ok
[09:08:20] <rxaviers> thks
[09:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with releasing what we have now (once everything is tied together).
[09:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> The big thing left for the API site is how we want to document effects.
[09:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> and easings
[09:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kswedberg gnarf and anyone else interested: Do you have time to discuss that after this meeting?
[09:11:20] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:11:57] <kborchers> sorry, i have a meeting after this
[09:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll get together with jzaefferer, hopefully kswedberg or gnarf is around at that point.
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to give an update for download builder?
[09:13:59] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: sorry. in a mtg. let's discuss later?
[09:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Does 1:00p ET work for you?
[09:14:47] <jzaefferer> worksforme
[09:16:15] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: no, I'm out until 2pm
[09:16:19] <kswedberg> ET
[09:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer?
[09:16:31] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, sure... Im working on the server part of the Theme Roller port for download builder.  So far, it creates theme full CSS (replacing the theme variables). It generates theme images (by actually fetching it from the 1.8 server);
[09:16:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yeah, that probably works, too
[09:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:16:59] <jzaefferer> more important to get kswedberg on there then me anyway ;)
[09:17:08] <rxaviers> and it's already building the package with those.
[09:17:14] <kswedberg> not sure about that. jzaefferer is superman
[09:17:30] <jzaefferer> maybe, but kswedberg is apidocman!
[09:17:43] <kswedberg> :)
[09:18:04] <rxaviers> The server-side todos are: it needs to generate the minified theme CSS; Handle <no theme> and <saved theme>; Finish unit test; Some other minor things;
[09:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sounds like you're making good progress.
[09:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> Also, holding off on image processing in node has another benefit.
[09:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> We're dropping IE6 support in 1.10.
[09:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> So we weon't need to worry about crippled png support.
[09:19:57] <rxaviers> That's great. Porting the image creation was a heavy weight part of it. That is another great good thing to know.
[09:21:25] <rxaviers> And that's it.. I still didnt touch much in the front side of it.. There's a lot of things there, which I still dont know estimate the effort.
[09:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder how much of the old front-end we can just copy over.
[09:22:04] <rxaviers> yeah me too :)
[09:22:17] <rxaviers> I mean, I hope most of it
[09:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be good.
[09:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> We haven't made much progress on jqueryui.com.
[09:22:39] <rxaviers> it will be a job of separating the php code from it I guess
[09:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> I still haven't seen any work from the designers who were supposed to be working on this for a few weeks now.
[09:22:54] <jzaefferer> the old one is pretty much just a bunch of templates stringed together, along with a bunch of JS
[09:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> I did get the TOC generated for the upgrade guide.
[09:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> And it's done in such a way that we can auto-generate a TOC for any page just by adding a flag.
[09:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> I should move that into grunt-jquery-content.
[09:24:39] <jzaefferer> yeady!
[09:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of moving things into grunt-jquery-content, we can probably move the XSL for the API sites next week.
[09:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> Last thing on the agenda, I'm sure everyone is aware of...
[09:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.0-rc.1 was released :-)
[09:27:12] <kborchers> \o/
[09:27:15] <rxaviers> :)
[09:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> If nobody has anything else to discuss, we're done.
[09:27:54] <jzaefferer> very little feedback on that so far, right?
[09:28:00] <jzaefferer> neither good nor bad
[09:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> Just one bug report (a regression).
[09:28:12] <jzaefferer> the datepicker thing?
[09:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:28:50] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:29:53] <jzaefferer> wraps!
