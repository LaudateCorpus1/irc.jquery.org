[08:59:46] <rworth> hey all
[08:59:59] <gnarf> hey, shhh yer early
[09:00:02] <gnarf> okay
[09:00:04] <gnarf> now its time
[09:00:26] <rworth> ok, let's get started
[09:00:27] <jzaefferer> hey all y'all!
[09:00:34] <ajpiano> hi hi
[09:00:36] <rworth> danheberden here?
[09:00:44] <gnarf> danheberden is on lion
[09:01:23] <gnarf> $.when( danheberden ).then( infrastructure );
[09:01:25] <gnarf> ?
[09:01:40] <danheberden> heh i think i'm alive and working
[09:01:48] <danheberden> though i can't swipe back in chrome :(
[09:01:50] <gnarf> infrastructure
[09:01:54] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, any news on recruiting?
[09:02:18] <danheberden> so clarkbox is totally rocking the view.jqueryui.com work
[09:02:29] <jzaefferer> nice
[09:02:37] <danheberden> last step is to get the url form and that branch listing on the home page
[09:02:40] <rworth> :)
[09:02:41] <danheberden> and then it's good to go
[09:02:52] <danheberden> and instead of proxying github evertytime
[09:02:58] <danheberden> its just serving local content
[09:03:03] <rworth> yay
[09:03:06] <danheberden> all thanks to clarkbox's smarts
[09:03:15] <ajpiano> recruiting... uhh.
[09:03:18] <ajpiano> you guys see that gnarf guy
[09:03:19] <ajpiano> :p
[09:03:21] <jzaefferer> sounds like something we could also reuse elsewhere?
[09:03:28] <danheberden> jzaefferer ya, just not sure where
[09:03:35] <danheberden> like - ui is the place with demos
[09:03:39] <danheberden> so wherever else needs that
[09:03:40] <gnarf> ajpiano: am I ur success story?
[09:03:48] <ajpiano> i think so
[09:03:48] <ajpiano> :p
[09:03:49] <jzaefferer> so, where's the code?
[09:04:01] <gnarf> so what did ajpiano do when he was dev relations lead
[09:04:05] <danheberden> its a separate branch right now, on jquery/view-jquery-org i think
[09:04:08] <gnarf> .... "recruited gnarf" ....
[09:04:10] <danheberden> jzaefferer: ^
[09:04:28] <jzaefferer> totally 404s
[09:04:37] <danheberden> the index page for code, eddie said he was going to tackle it along with a big list of other things
[09:04:53] <danheberden> but still think he's on vacatinon/in hiding
[09:04:54] <jzaefferer> maybe this? https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org
[09:05:00] <danheberden> jzaefferer that's the one
[09:05:11] <jzaefferer> why is it on http://view.jquery.org/ ?
[09:05:18] <danheberden> it's the same site
[09:05:34] <danheberden> like - literally
[09:05:48] <danheberden> it just [used to] serve different content depending on the server_name
[09:06:00] <danheberden> but i think core doesn't particularly need one
[09:06:01] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:06:10] <jzaefferer> very nice :-)
[09:06:14] <danheberden> but that's a discussion for non-ui
[09:06:21] <jzaefferer> yep
[09:06:26] <jzaefferer> can we make the repo public?
[09:06:31] <danheberden> yeah, clarkbox has been super helpful
[09:06:39] <danheberden> jzaefferer i'll just make sure there's nothing private in there
[09:06:48] <jzaefferer> of course :p
[09:06:48] <danheberden> github api key or something
[09:06:57] <danheberden> MAH PRIVATES IN TEH REPO
[09:07:07] <jzaefferer> ssh root
[09:08:27] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:08:41] <jzaefferer> so danheberden ajpiano, is there still a need to do recruiting for infrastructure?
[09:08:58] <danheberden> yeah, we still need to talk about it together
[09:09:09] <ajpiano> i think there is always a need for it
[09:09:22] <jzaefferer> okay, then talky talky, NEXT!
[09:09:46] <danheberden> when you're as cool as ajpiano and I, its hard to find time for that!
[09:09:55] <danheberden> dizzocs
[09:09:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, danheberden, are you still totally opposed to Wordpress? seems like starting with that for jquery-docs could get as closer to something that actually works much sooner
[09:10:23] <danheberden> jzaefferer wordpress/deployment is hardly the problem
[09:10:45] <jzaefferer> otherwise we have to tackle navigation and search from scratch, and we've got nothing for that so far
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> I think pros/cons of wordpress vs. completely custom would help make that decision
[09:11:07] <danheberden> jzaefferer well we're tackling all of those issues with the learning site anyway
[09:11:11] <danheberden> so why not reap those rewards
[09:11:16] <rworth> I'm pro WP
[09:11:39] <danheberden> its extra infra overhead, harder to manage in my opinion
[09:11:50] <danheberden> and we already have a system being built
[09:11:56] <rworth> I'd like to see us write a simple script that handles a github hook on a commit to docs content, dumps the content into the mysql table
[09:12:07] <jzaefferer> so what's the status of navigation and search on the learning site?
[09:12:25] <rworth> you say we already have a system being built, I say we already have a system built
[09:12:28] <ajpiano> danheberden: i suspect it's because jzaefferer doesn't want to wait for us to cross that bridge....
[09:12:32] <danheberden> rworth a bad system built
[09:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: that system is getting built no matter what we do with docs
[09:12:45] <danheberden> is this due next week?
[09:12:59] <danheberden> are we rushing to get docs deployed?
[09:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> docs won't be deployed until 1.9
[09:13:16] <jzaefferer> no ones rushing, but that's also no reason to have no progress at all
[09:13:32] <danheberden> jzaefferer i was under the impression we were still working the xslt's and formatting
[09:13:34] <danheberden> not deployment
[09:13:42] <danheberden> if the xml and stylesheets are a ok
[09:13:48] <danheberden> then i'll start focusing on deployment
[09:13:52] <jzaefferer> if we have no solution for deployment I'd rather have that in focus sooner
[09:13:58] <danheberden> but we don't even have a schema finalized
[09:14:00] <jzaefferer> the one doesn't block the other
[09:14:13] <rworth> agreed, they can work in parallel
[09:14:14] <danheberden> jzaefferer no, but we're just adding more todos
[09:14:40] <danheberden> instead of focusing on something and getting it done
[09:14:47] <jzaefferer> we're not making progress on the one thing, but at least that's somewhat solid; I'd like to have something in place that shows the entire setup can actually work
[09:15:03] <jzaefferer> which will also help to convince kswedberg that we're on the right track
[09:15:10] <rworth> +1
[09:15:13] <gnarf> no matter what we are doing, the xml+xlst will be somewhere right?
[09:15:15] <jzaefferer> and getting his help would be nice
[09:15:21] <danheberden> which we're getting to/doing with the learning site
[09:15:23] <rworth> gnarf: yes, in github
[09:15:39] <rworth> the open question is how does it end up in prod
[09:15:40] <danheberden> if people want to contribute to the learning site
[09:15:43] <jzaefferer> so, what's the status of navigation and search on the learning site?
[09:15:45] <danheberden> then we could get some more progress
[09:16:21] <jzaefferer> I talked with Adam last week, I think he was like 'here are various options, we haven't tried anything'
[09:16:25] <danheberden> jzaefferer navigation works via nanoc, but ajpiano was working on getting hierarchal nav to work
[09:16:30] <danheberden> we still need to investigate search options
[09:16:43] <ajpiano> yes, that is still where i am
[09:16:46] <danheberden> yeah, the biggest first step was rendering markdown into the pages
[09:17:03] <danheberden> it's just adam and I on the actual build stuff i think
[09:17:13] <jzaefferer> I've got someone interesting in helping on the QUnit site, which could potentially use the same stack as learning and api
[09:17:19] <danheberden> and adam is the one doing everything
[09:17:26] <jzaefferer> right now I dunno what to tell him except work on jquery-docs xml
[09:17:32] <danheberden> i guess re: wp
[09:17:40] <danheberden> i really, really want to get away from it
[09:17:45] <rworth> why?
[09:17:46] <danheberden> if we can get this learning site type of deployment working
[09:17:51] <danheberden> it'd be such less overhead on the servers
[09:18:01] <danheberden> easier to manage via git
[09:18:42] <jzaefferer> Adam, can we put the search options together somewhere and get some opinions on them?
[09:19:05] <jzaefferer> navigation is static, I'm not worrying about that too much, but search isn't...
[09:19:19] <ajpiano> i think we just have to actually try implementing one
[09:19:20] <rworth> I feel like we're not yet 50% done with our transition to WP, which I think is a mighty fine system, esp. seeing where we came from. And it sounds like you're proposing we now move to a system that's in development
[09:19:30] <ajpiano> rather than just assessing things blindly
[09:19:39] <danheberden> rworth you were all for this system
[09:19:42] <danheberden> wtf changed?
[09:19:50] <rworth> and would this (eventually) be for everything? Caus a couple years ago we sat down and said "Yes, WP for pretty much everything"
[09:20:02] <rworth> I'm all for docs being in github
[09:20:14] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: right now all I have is a skype log somewhere, would be good to write down the options (not on an etherpad) and share that at least with this group
[09:20:21] <danheberden> rworth and everyone didn't like that idea via ui meetings
[09:20:29] <danheberden> they said that "someone" said wp for everything
[09:20:35] <danheberden> this isn't a blog
[09:20:41] <danheberden> so why are we using wordpress
[09:20:47] <gnarf> ++
[09:20:51] <rworth> and not editing XML via WP, but there are a ton of other WP features you're now suggesting we walk away from
[09:21:04] <danheberden> like the overhead of running shit through mysql
[09:21:10] <danheberden> which crashes on all of these mt boxes
[09:21:19] <rworth> that's a data point I don't have
[09:21:43] <danheberden> well, its built, right?
[09:21:47] <danheberden> i mean - api is using it currently
[09:21:49] <danheberden> so if we hit 1.9
[09:21:56] <danheberden> and we can't do the stataic deployment
[09:22:01] <danheberden> we can easily deploy using wp, ya?
[09:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> I think rworth and jzaefferer are looking for proof of that
[09:22:33] <danheberden> git pull, import into mysql - that's a simple work around if wee need it
[09:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> since we have a different structure than core
[09:22:48] <rworth> seems quite simple to me, so let's start there
[09:22:53] <rworth> this would also work for core
[09:23:03] <danheberden> fine
[09:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> btw, direct injection into the tables sounds scary to me
[09:23:38] <gnarf> just seems like we're asking the busiest section of the team to working something we are going to try our best to throw away
[09:24:03] <rworth> we're going to try our best to throw away WP?
[09:24:15] <rworth> that's what's coming as brand new news to me, if I'm understanding right
[09:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> we're going to try our best to throw away WP for API
[09:24:33] <danheberden> we've talked about getting rid of WP in many ui meetings
[09:24:36] <gnarf> docs sites in general right?
[09:24:38] <danheberden> and everyone was on board
[09:24:40] <rworth> WP for authoring and managing the content of API, at a minimum, from my perspective
[09:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> we were very clear on not using WP at all for API
[09:25:30] <danheberden> so we're using wp to deploy content, not even edit it
[09:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> discussing how to implement search is the first time that WP has been mentioned in months
[09:25:34] <danheberden> why use git then?
[09:25:47] <rworth> what's not clear however is how our site functions without it
[09:25:58] <gnarf> .html
[09:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: what specifically isn't clear?
[09:26:15] <gnarf> xslt translated into coolness?
[09:26:50] <rworth> search, navigation, hierarchy, tags, permalinks, slugs, caching, etc.
[09:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> the only thing WP provides there is search
[09:27:18] <rworth> all the non-author-using-a-wysiwig-editor-from-wp-admin features of WP that we can use even if we author an manage content in git
[09:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> we have to define navigation, heirarchy, tags
[09:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> there's no caching because it's all static
[09:27:42] <rworth> except that WP has themes and plugins, and lots of people know themes and plugins and they get tested and updated
[09:27:49] <rworth> and are easy to deploy and upgrade
[09:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> but we don't need them
[09:28:00] <danheberden> what theme?
[09:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> we have our own custom written theme
[09:28:13] <rworth> right, and isn't it a WP theme?
[09:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> it's raw HTML + CSS
[09:28:25] <rworth> isn't that what Darcy's working on, a WP theme?
[09:28:25] <danheberden> it had to be MADE into a wordpress theme for the sake of old sites
[09:28:31] <rworth> got it
[09:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> search is the only feature we're talking about
[09:28:52] <danheberden> seems silly to use git if you want to use wp
[09:29:14] <danheberden> we could just copy the api setup over, replace the templates and xslt
[09:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> we want the docs source to be public
[09:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> and having it tagged with code will be useful as well
[09:29:57] <danheberden> maybe there's a wp plugin to show original content?
[09:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> you can't send a pull request against WP
[09:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> right now we have this conversation all the time:
[09:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> community member: "how do I fix these incorrect docs?"
[09:30:45] <danheberden> so we're using wordpress for search, url rewrites and themes?
[09:30:49] <rworth> I don't understand why it seems silly, WP does not mean blog, and why can't a WP site present content that originates in a db other than its own
[09:30:53] <danheberden> and importing shit into it
[09:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> us: "umm...we attempt to give you access to a broken MediaWiki install"
[09:31:44] <rworth> what I'm trying to tackle is how/whether we'll have two sep. sites. I'd rather have jqueryui.com as a WP site that can also host docs, so it can be as integrated as possible
[09:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> injecting content into WP without an actual API seems really scary to me
[09:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like it's almost guaranteed to fail
[09:32:14] <rworth> how so? It's just content in a single field in a single table in mysql?
[09:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> no way
[09:32:26] <gnarf> api.jqueryui.com / blog.jqueryui.com / jqueryui.com
[09:32:26] <jzaefferer> let's table that discussion for now, focus on the xslt/xml stuff and helping the learn-site team set up a static site generator with search
[09:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> there's crazy metadata on everything, isn't there?
[09:32:37] <jzaefferer> then check if that can work for us
[09:33:13] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, is anyone but you working on learn?
[09:33:17] <ajpiano> it's dan and i
[09:33:34] <ajpiano> but "it's dan and i" describes a lot of projects so
[09:33:37] <jzaefferer> weren't there other contributors?
[09:33:46] <ajpiano> addy osmani is hepling as well
[09:33:48] <danheberden> addy is working on content stuffs
[09:33:51] <ajpiano> but not really in technical stuff
[09:34:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: fill me in on learn
[09:34:06] <gnarf> i'll see if there's something I can add
[09:34:18] <ajpiano> do you know ruby
[09:34:19] <ajpiano> :p
[09:34:25] <jzaefferer> gnarf, wanna explore options for searching?
[09:34:37] <jzaefferer> or rather, test one or two...
[09:34:46] <gnarf> not by memory (yet) but have been looking for a really good reason to learn it
[09:34:56] <jzaefferer> hired!
[09:35:20] <gnarf> i wish you had said "node"
[09:35:21] <gnarf> instad
[09:35:23] <jzaefferer> speaking of hired, your grid contract should be available for signing any day now
[09:35:32] <danheberden> gnarf heh, such a hipster
[09:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok, moving on...
[09:36:36] <gnarf> I know over 15 programming languages - i'm confident that ruby wont throw me for a loop
[09:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update the colorize demo
[09:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: what's the status of widget factory docs?
[09:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> and where are they?
[09:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> because http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget-factory is way out of date
[09:37:53] <ajpiano> the same as it was the last time we checked-  the first part of that page is relatively recent
[09:38:17] <ajpiano> just the properties and nuts-and-bolts API points need to be updated
[09:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:38:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do a run through of that page too
[09:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, kborchers: menu
[09:40:35] <jzaefferer> I need to review the last pull request(s)
[09:40:47] <jzaefferer> and the issues with the navigation menu
[09:41:06] <jzaefferer> in general going well
[09:41:14] <kborchers> Writing unit tests for keyboard nav
[09:41:20] <gnarf> yay!~
[09:41:28] <rworth> kborchers: using simulate?
[09:41:34] <kborchers> Yes
[09:41:36] <rworth> yay
[09:41:37] <jzaefferer> Selectmenu: Talked with Felix last week, he should be working on the remaining open issues
[09:42:15] <jzaefferer> Datepicker: What is says there, update from Hans should come this week
[09:42:54] <rworth> is that on existing or branch?
[09:43:02] <jzaefferer> datepicker branch
[09:43:25] <jzaefferer> Tooltip: I actually reviewed Chris' feedback and posted a reply, mostly asking for clarifiaction, didn't hear back
[09:45:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, got an estimate for the 1.6.2 support? any news on 'boolean' ARIA attributes?
[09:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we figured out boolean ARIA attributes are actually strings
[09:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> and should go through .attr()
[09:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> I started making some progress on that at the hackathon
[09:45:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: anything I can do to help on that front?
[09:45:54] <scott_gonzalez> still some more work to do, but I don't think we're stuck anymore
[09:46:04] <jzaefferer> good
[09:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: checkout https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/core-1.6.1
[09:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> you actually have to manually put 1.6.x in there :-P
[09:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> I've just been pasting the contents of 1.6.2 into the jquery-1.5.1 file for testing
[09:46:45] <gnarf> k
[09:46:48] <jzaefferer> as for the Testing point, where do we need to test animations?
[09:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> we need to test all widgets in all browsers
[09:46:53] <gnarf> btw
[09:47:07] <gnarf> how do you guys feel about dropping the -1.5.1 part of that filename eventually
[09:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: if you want to work on that, let's communicate on what we're working on so we don't waste time double testing
[09:47:26] <rworth> didn't we answer that a couple weeks back?
[09:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: let's just find the ticket
[09:47:41] <gnarf> maybe? if you did it slipped my mind
[09:47:45] <jzaefferer> rworth, just write down your answer in public and link to it
[09:47:47] <scott_gonzalez> we need an FAQ section on jqueryui.com
[09:47:49] <rworth> gnarf: I think we did last time
[09:48:01] <jzaefferer> saying "we already answered that" is not helpful
[09:48:20] <gnarf> if you did, i forgot the resolutions, sorry to double ask
[09:48:33] <rworth> np
[09:48:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7171
[09:48:54] <rworth> there it is
[09:49:03] <rworth> got it about 2sec after scott_gonzalez
[09:49:18] <jzaefferer> ha
[09:49:46] <jzaefferer> again, any input on testing animations? gnarf?
[09:50:01] <jzaefferer> otherwise I'll just drop that from the agenda, been pulling that along for some time
[09:50:05] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i've been trying to get the actual effects tested
[09:50:17] <gnarf> and making sure things like margins
[09:50:19] <gnarf> position
[09:50:20] <gnarf> etc
[09:50:21] <gnarf> display
[09:50:24] <gnarf> show correctly
[09:50:27] <gnarf> all thats there already
[09:50:33] <gnarf> but i don't know how detailed we want to get
[09:50:39] <gnarf> with testing options / api /etc
[09:50:46] <gnarf> or how detailed we can get....
[09:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think the context here is testing animations in widgets
[09:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> like ensuring that using effects for dialog open work properly
[09:51:47] <gnarf> you could make a test effect
[09:52:02] <gnarf> using the $.effects.effect.test = function()
[09:52:09] <gnarf> animate using "test"
[09:52:24] <gnarf> make sure it is animating the right elements
[09:52:24] <gnarf> ?
[09:52:38] <gnarf> is that animation hooking in widget core stuff?
[09:52:38] <jzaefferer> could you put an example together, e.g. extend the tooltip testsuite with that?
[09:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, let's figure out what specifically we'd want to test for various components and then figure out what we need to test them
[09:53:07] <jzaefferer> see if tooltip works with Widget._show/_hide
[09:53:16] <gnarf> aye
[09:53:21] <gnarf> i'll look into it this week
[09:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok, last item
[09:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: any news from Felix on download builder
[09:54:34] <jzaefferer> talked to Felix yesterday, he started working on it again just then, but is basically busy all the time with other stuff
[09:54:37] <gnarf> quick afk - be back for grid
[09:55:00] <jzaefferer> though he considered supporting incremental updates, told him that's not important right now
[09:55:06] <rworth> what exactly is he working on? something non-Make?
[09:55:10] <jzaefferer> probably worth waiting another week
[09:55:18] <jzaefferer> node-based build file to replace ant
[09:55:35] <rworth> oh, this is download builder, sorry I was thinking Make+node not Ant
[09:56:25] <jzaefferer> well, he's actually working on just the build file
[09:56:34] <jzaefferer> but with the goal of using that for download builder, too
[09:56:44] <rworth> and is he doing that without Make?
[09:56:52] <jzaefferer> I think so
[09:57:04] <jzaefferer> does it Make a difference? /o\
[09:57:22] <rworth> is he inventing his own build file/build system? Node doesn't even do that, they use WAF
[09:57:57] <jzaefferer> so what, node can't build itself, therefore using something else
[09:58:10] <rworth> which, btw, is Python-based and as generic (programming language-wise) as Make is
[09:58:44] <rworth> I'm saying the fact that we're using Node should not preclude the use of a non-node build system, since (afaik) one does not exist
[09:59:05] <rworth> that is, I don't know of a node-specific build system
[09:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> why do we need an exsiting build system? we don't actually compile anything
[09:59:19] <jzaefferer> actually there's Jake
[09:59:24] <jzaefferer> which isn't that great
[09:59:28] <rworth> certainly if one is being worked on, it's far behind Make and WAF
[09:59:40] <rworth> just saying let's not reinvent the wheel and NIH
[09:59:41] <gnarf> rworth: actually i think rwaldron has already build a "plugin builder" in node
[09:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, even building this from scratch wouldn't be any more time consuming that building something using an existing tool
[09:59:52] <rwaldron> nope
[09:59:55] <rwaldron> not me
[09:59:58] <gnarf> hrm
[10:00:01] <gnarf> someone was doing that
[10:00:02] <gnarf> ...
[10:00:36] <rworth> the things we need doing are the things build systems do, copy files, run commands, run commands on each file, move files, delete files, zip files, etc.
[10:00:48] <rworth> so we should be using one of those systems, not building one
[10:01:14] <scott_gonzalez> node has that type of stuff pretty much built in
[10:01:25] <gnarf> but, that wheel isn't as sexy!
[10:01:30] <gnarf> I want a red bike shed!
[10:01:46] <rworth> ok, grid mtg time
[10:01:56] <gnarf> (I'm all for a fun build system)
[10:02:15] <vmitnick> are we doing the grid meeting here or on skype today?
[10:02:30] <rworth> it's on the schedule as an irc mtg
[10:02:35] <gnarf> i hope not skype, i'll sound like a robot 42 minutes later
[10:02:48] <vmitnick> irc is good; just checking since it moved to skype last week.
[10:03:06] <rworth> that happens at times when its 2-3 people at their discretion
[10:03:13] <jzaefferer> the agenda just says whatever it had there for a long time
[10:03:24] <jzaefferer> considering the small group, I'd rather go Skype
[10:03:40] <rworth> do we know the group size? Who's all here?
[10:03:49] <borismoore> me
[10:03:55] <gnarf> me
[10:04:06] <vmitnick> me (nothing to say, just observing)
[10:04:18] <chrisBannon> here
[10:04:51] <rworth> borismoore: do you know if Brad will be here?
[10:04:52] <jzaefferer> hey chrisBannon, independent of this meeting now, can you take another look at the Tooltip wiki page and provide some more details?
[10:05:08] <chrisBannon> sure
[10:05:11] <borismoore> Not sure. I think he may not be able to make it today
[10:05:15] <rworth> ok
[10:05:22] <borismoore> From what he said last night...
[10:05:59] <rworth> jzaefferer: do you want to give us an update on editing?
[10:06:25] <jzaefferer> there are a few improvements on the main demo: http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-editing/grid.html
[10:07:16] <jzaefferer> I spend some time on the focus handling of the inline editor, by now I think I should drop the blur handler and instead bind to click events outside - current approach is messy and unreliable
[10:07:39] <jzaefferer> I've started migrating to jsrender, requires changes in more then just editing files, so took longer
[10:07:48] <jzaefferer> still only local
[10:08:14] <jzaefferer> but that was already helpful, want to discuss the plugin wrapper of jsrender with Boris
[10:08:30] <jzaefferer> e.g. I think a method that returns a jQuery object, containing the rendered template, is very useful
[10:08:39] <jzaefferer> as long as its a helper, not the required way to go
[10:08:53] <borismoore> I just pushed the updated JsViews implementation to https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews, and also updated the Grid demos here http://borismoore.github.com/jquery-ui/grid-spf-observable/index.html https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-ui/tree/grid/grid-spf-observable to use it.
[10:09:06] <borismoore> JsViews gives you the wrapper.
[10:09:09] <jzaefferer> speaking of template, also want to discuss my {{wrap}} strawman, either use that or drop {{wrap}} completely
[10:09:36] <jzaefferer> I'm not sold on jsviews as-is, so would help if we could move that over to jsrender
[10:09:43] <jzaefferer> as that just needs polishing
[10:10:09] <borismoore> I need to look at having a wrapper in JsRender, but it should not confuse the issue of JsRender being pure string concatenation
[10:11:00] <borismoore> I think we should review JsViews, together, which we have still not done, so that we can then figure out about Grid needs for data link (or not)
[10:11:09] <borismoore> What about using template for edit mode
[10:11:11] <jzaefferer> jsrender needs some more API update anyway - the current mix of loading templates and rendering them, as nice as it is in the default case, is a bit messy
[10:11:18] <borismoore> So ;users can provide editors
[10:11:24] <borismoore> What about using template for edit mode
[10:11:37] <borismoore> so users can provide editors (I meant)
[10:12:10] <jzaefferer> that won't change the usage of jsrender, so I'd like to tackle that first
[10:12:22] <borismoore> Yes, I'll look at it, and the scenarios
[10:12:57] <borismoore> Well let's follow up on a Skype call. Difficult on IRC to explain the pros and cons in detail, or discuss the design implications
[10:13:05] <ajpiano> are we definitely using an actual input replacement for editing, or has there been any consideration given to using contenteditable?
[10:13:31] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, spinner and autocomplete are based on input
[10:13:57] <ajpiano> ah, true
[10:13:58] <jzaefferer> I haven't yet considered contenteditable, we don't have anything for that right now
[10:13:59] <rworth> do we know about a11y for contenteditable?
[10:14:11] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: i have some work i can show you
[10:14:36] <ajpiano> but it does make me uneasy, it's definitely not *as* well supported as doing input replacement
[10:14:49] <ajpiano> and i certainly don't know aobut that, rworth
[10:15:16] <jzaefferer> Jennison managed to get his name on the ARIA hacakathon attendees list, so it can't be that bad
[10:15:31] <ajpiano> but the spinner and autocomplete and datepicker is a relevant thing to consider
[10:15:31] <jzaefferer> though editing hrefs obviously wasn't working well
[10:16:48] <jzaefferer> anything else? chrisBannon, vmitnick, anything you'd like to know about?
[10:17:20] <chrisBannon> we are going to start eval'ing datasource for our grid use
[10:17:33] <chrisBannon> can you point me to the right repo/source to use?
[10:17:38] <ajpiano> chrisBannon: just use a script tag, you don't have to eval it
[10:17:41] <ajpiano> :p
[10:17:47] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid#StatusandTasks
[10:17:57] <gnarf> oops
[10:18:00] <gnarf> hit enter early there
[10:18:05] <jzaefferer> this is a good starting point: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Grid-SPF
[10:18:25] <jzaefferer> basically all files in the grid branch, grid-spf folder, e.g. http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-spf/menugrid.html
[10:18:58] <jzaefferer> if you want to test the nested/preloader thing, keep in mind that its still buggy
[10:19:17] <rworth> chrisBannon: that'll be some great feedback for us
[10:19:42] <borismoore> Review is pending on the datasource  in general. Your eval can be part of that of course...
[10:19:43] <jzaefferer> there's some condition where something fails to load, some unit testing would probably help there, haven't gotten around to that - Brad was interested in working on the preloader, but I don't think he's done anything so far
[10:19:53] <chrisBannon> ok, we mainly just want to start binding our grid to your datasource to 1) see if it meets needs and 2) see if it is extensible to add features to
[10:20:17] <jzaefferer> so far its really about supporting the spf usecase
[10:20:21] <chrisBannon> sure, we can definitely give feedback from our r&d
[10:20:22] <jzaefferer> which it does pretty well
[10:20:28] <jzaefferer> but nothing really beyond that
[10:20:59] <chrisBannon> we will most likely look at extending it beyond SPF, is that possible with its current architecture (extensibility that is)?
[10:21:32] <jzaefferer> what are you looking for?
[10:22:19] <chrisBannon> just that we can extend it with things like grouping, aggregates, etc
[10:22:41] <jzaefferer> yeah, that should work quite well, as its basically just adding more options
[10:22:49] <chrisBannon> ok sounds good
[10:22:52] <jzaefferer> and thats all based on the widget factory
[10:23:32] <jzaefferer> some of the subclasses, like the odataSource is actually adding an option, here just a url-string, but still, the pattern should apply to other usecases
[10:25:45] <rworth> anything else?
[10:25:46] <chrisBannon> thanks
[10:25:48] <chrisBannon> ok, thats all I had
[10:25:52] <gnarf> jzaefferer: I want to start researching wherever you guys want my time going - Recently I remember talking w/ jzaefferer about Custom Inputs stuff, what stuff isn't actively being worked on?
[10:26:12] <gnarf> and/or what are the priorities
[10:26:13] <rworth> gnarf: lets you and jzaefferer get together
[10:26:20] <gnarf> k
[10:26:29] <rworth> I mean and I
[10:26:42] <rworth> you and jzaefferer and I
[10:26:52] <rworth> ok, thanks everyone
[10:26:55] <gnarf> aye, i implied that with the "lets"
[10:27:20] <borismoore> thanks...
[10:27:53] <jzaefferer> if you look at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40076546/Grid-CustomInputs - Timepicker is completely open for grabs, Mask needs someone to work with Josh, Selectmenu needs someone to work with Felix, Checkbox and Radiobutton need someone to work with Benjamin
[10:28:37] <jzaefferer> Hans was testing Spinner, not sure if that needs work on the ARIA side, there are certainly various TODOs and no one working on it
[10:28:55] <borismoore> Shouldn't we determine whether templates should be used, like they are for custom non-editable columns?
[10:29:36] <borismoore> It gives complete control over HTML
[10:30:01] <borismoore> and simplifies the click event chain design
[10:31:35] <jzaefferer> we're exploring that with the datepicker prototype, there's still various open issues
[10:32:04] <borismoore> It would be a good driver for design and scenarios for JsRender
[10:32:23] <borismoore> are the issues around templating, or orthogonal?
