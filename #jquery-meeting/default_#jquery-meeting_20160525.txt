[12:00:10] <fnagel> hi
[12:02:40] <arschmitz> hi
[12:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> We got a PR for the checkbox radio inside dialog bug.
[12:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14955
[12:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1704
[12:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> The PR doesn't look valid though.
[12:03:26] <arschmitz> yeah and they added tests i didnt in my branch
[12:03:32] <arschmitz> oh bummer i only skimmed
[12:03:38] <arschmitz> didnt look at how they did it
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> They changed `background` to just `background-color`.
[12:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> Which means that ThemeRoller won't work.
[12:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> Because none of the custom styles can be applied.
[12:04:16] <arschmitz> yup
[12:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> Do you already have a local fix for this?
[12:05:07] <arschmitz> a couple ha ha
[12:05:25] <arschmitz> i dont like the fixes so was debating which to use
[12:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> You could send multiple PRs for us to discuss.
[12:06:54] <arschmitz> i can
[12:07:28] <arschmitz> once the control group one lands i have another controlgroup one ready to push also
[12:07:36] <arschmitz> but it depends on current one
[12:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had time to look at the update yet.
[12:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> Had the PEWG meeting right before this.
[12:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> And was fixing some other bugs before that.
[12:08:07] <arschmitz> no problem
[12:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be able to review it today though.
[12:08:23] <arschmitz> yeah i saw pr
[12:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol sent a PR to update jQuery Core versions: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1706
[12:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> Also adds jQuery 2.x to CI.
[12:16:27] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:18:29] <arschmitz> no
[12:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
