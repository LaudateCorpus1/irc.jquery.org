[09:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone!
[09:02:49] <kborchers> hey
[09:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> rworth jzaefferer: docs update?
[09:03:41] <jzaefferer> that time again!
[09:03:43] <rworth> :)
[09:04:12] <jzaefferer> We've recruited kswedberg to work on the index page for api.jquery.com - we'll apply that to the other API sites
[09:04:33] <rworth> I'm working on getting the pretty titles in there, just about done
[09:04:42] <jzaefferer> Some content updates landed, but nothing big
[09:05:02] <jzaefferer> Effects and Widget docs still suck, interactions need some updates as well
[09:05:26] <kswedberg> rworth: awesome. think you could give me a hand at some point getting grunt to work again? says it can't find pygmentize
[09:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> stuck?
[09:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Did you `npm install`?
[09:06:00] <jzaefferer> Open issues are now listed here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues
[09:06:06] <rworth> I'm gonna do some markup and xsl normalization work this week
[09:06:06] <rworth> between core ui and mobile docs
[09:06:07] <rworth> ideally get a single xsl, and into an npm package (with some grunt tasks) to share between these 3
[09:06:09] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I need to do that again?
[09:06:20] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: + qunit
[09:06:29] <jzaefferer> err
[09:06:34] <jzaefferer> rworth ^^^
[09:06:39] <jzaefferer> stupid autocomplete
[09:06:43] <rworth> oh yeah, thanks
[09:06:53] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: whenever there's a package.json change
[09:07:26] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: aha. cool. thanks! looks like it's install new stuff for me now.
[09:07:39] <rworth> speaking of titles, kswedberg should we add a title attribute on the entry node, for the pretty title ?
[09:08:07] <kswedberg> rworth: I was thinking about that. Seems like it would be cleaner to just have a <title> node as the first child of <entry>
[09:08:42] <rworth> ok
[09:08:51] <jzaefferer> cleaner?
[09:09:03] <jzaefferer> do we expect titles to have more then, say, three words?
[09:09:36] <rworth> some have quotes
[09:09:36] <kswedberg> Attribute Contains Prefix Selector [name|="value"]
[09:09:44] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[09:09:55] <jzaefferer> yeah, that needs an element
[09:12:11] <jzaefferer> Next!
[09:12:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: tabs?
[09:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> Still working on the ARIA implementation.
[09:12:33] <jzaefferer> I saw some wiki updates
[09:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's almost done. There's just been a lot of back and forth about what we should implement.
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a lot of stuff beyond what's in the ARIA best practices.
[09:12:56] <jzaefferer> the evil PR :-)
[09:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[09:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> Right now we have delayed activation with arrow keys.
[09:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> So if you're on tab 1 and press right arrow twice, you won't activate tab 2 while navigating to tab 3.
[09:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> And tab 3 will activate half a second after the second arrow keypress.
[09:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> The idea was that you should be able to navigate quickly without activating everything in the middle.
[09:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Especially nice for ajax tabs.
[09:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> But we've added ctrl+arrow keys to move focus without activating at all.
[09:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> And then you can press space/enter to activate.
[09:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm wondering if we should just drop the delay now that we have ctrl+arrow.
[09:15:08] <jzaefferer> so you added the delay before ctrl+arrow?
[09:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:15:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is ctrl+arrow intuitive for someone using a screen reader?
[09:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> I had the delay then Hans pointed out that nobody with AT would be able to navigate in half a second.
[09:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I believe so.
[09:16:24] <jzaefferer> Let's see what Hans thinks about that.
[09:16:56] <jzaefferer> As for discovering keyboard shortcuts, that's a pretty general issue. We don't really want to add live-regions everwhere to explain the keyboard controls.
[09:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We can actually have extensions that do that.
[09:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> Bound to a specific help control key.
[09:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> So like you press ? or whatever and it spits out instructions into a live region.
[09:18:06] <jzaefferer> Right
[09:18:17] <jzaefferer> So autocomplete now just works, without the implementor having to know anything about ARIA
[09:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> So the delay is essentially for sighted keyboard users.
[09:18:33] <jzaefferer> The live region tells you that up/down arrows work
[09:18:56] <kborchers> i guess as long as we provide the mechanism, the person building the interface can find the best way to explain to both AT users and not how to use shortcuts
[09:19:39] <jzaefferer> kborchers: that only works under the assumption that the implementor knows anything about ARIA and ATs, which is often not the case
[09:20:18] <scott_gonzalez> Well, ideally this is a short term problem.
[09:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> And then ARIA stops sucking and things just work.
[09:20:29] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: so delayed activation is just a convenience for sighted users?
[09:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> pretty much
[09:20:50] <jzaefferer> let's kick it out
[09:20:51] <kborchers> i would say we could drop the delay
[09:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> Screen reader users will need to use ctrl+arrow anyway.
[09:20:59] <jzaefferer> sighted user can just click tabs...
[09:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise they'll always wait for the full delay before hearing the name of the tab.
[09:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, some sighted users don't click.
[09:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> But it's not horrible if they activate the tabs inbetween.
[09:22:15] <jzaefferer> great timing for a disconnect :/
[09:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> They can still use ctrl to not activate, but there's not really any discoverability.
[09:22:42] <jzaefferer> none of the keyboard controls are obvious
[09:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> How so?
[09:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> They follow common conventions.
[09:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> With the exception of alt instead of ctrl.
[09:24:05] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:24:51] <jzaefferer> Let's see what Hans says. Dropping delayed activation seems fine to me.
[09:25:00] <jzaefferer> Regular arrow keys still work...
[09:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, though Hans will probably just say "Yeah, that makes JAWS happier"
[09:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> AT expect immediate activation.
[09:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> I specifically asked him if it fixes a JAWS announcement issue, so we'll wait to hear from him.
[09:27:00] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:27:21] <jzaefferer> Let's see if scottjehl is ready to talk about indeterminate progressbar...
[09:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> I talked to Doug about it this morning.
[09:27:37] <jzaefferer> Ah?
[09:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> He said static image is bad.
[09:27:47] <jzaefferer> What was the question anyway?
[09:27:55] <kborchers> did he provide a solution to theme an animated gif? :P
[09:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> I put a comment on the PR
[09:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> I think a indeterminate bar that doesn't animate doesn't make too much sense.
[09:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> The goal is to put people at ease, not make them freak out cause its not moving.
[09:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> That's from Doug.
[09:28:50] <jzaefferer> what's the PR?
[09:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/619
[09:29:32] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (2m, 1w ago): Progressbar: Add ability to set value: false for an indeterminate progressbar. Fixes #7624 - Progressbar: Support value: false for indeterminate progressbar
[09:31:39] <jzaefferer> Okay, I've got nothing to add to that. Though I can agree with Doug's concern
[09:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's keep it on hold for now :-/
[09:34:06] <jzaefferer> 1.8.21 is done, 1.8.22 and 1.9 in July...
[09:34:18] <jzaefferer> Tough enough to get all the sites done in time for the conference
[09:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> hopefully :-)
[09:35:42] <jzaefferer> Can we cut some corners to get at least essential sites done? Existing ones and API docs plus QUnit… learn, plugins could as well wait another month, if that helps to get others done?
[09:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: no, we can't push off plugins.
[09:36:45] <jzaefferer> learn?
[09:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> We've already trimmed down the list.
[09:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> Unless someone other than ajpiano is working on learn, what would that accomplish?
[09:37:24] <jzaefferer> okay, nevermind
[09:37:48] <jzaefferer> for plugins it seems like you're pretty much the only one working on it? Along with everything else you're working on?
[09:38:09] <jzaefferer> Can you spend a little more time on delegating work to others?
[09:38:31] <jzaefferer> One or two people that can take some load off of you
[09:38:32] <rwaldron> jzaefferer I've just updated to the latest qunitjs.com repo
[09:38:52] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: nice - now checkout the api.qunitjs.com repo ;)
[09:39:06] <rwaldron> different repo?
[09:39:08] <rwaldron> one sec
[09:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Is there something specific that I should be working on that I'm not?
[09:39:36] <rwaldron> jzaefferer I'm read-only on this repo.
[09:39:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: No, that's not the issue. There's just too much work to be done for you alone to get it all done in time. Right?
[09:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> Too much work overall? Yes, but it's not just me.
[09:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's you, rworth, kswedberg, rwaldron, ajpiano, nacin, etc.
[09:41:16] <rwaldron> brb
[09:41:24] <rwaldron> need to grab lunch food before dev leads meeting.
[09:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: No dev leads today.
[09:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's every other week.
[09:41:55] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez thanks for the heads up
[09:41:57] <rwaldron> oh
[09:41:57] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: you've got push access now
[09:42:04] <rwaldron> jzaefferer thank you sir
[09:42:18] <rwaldron> I wish i could set every-other week on iphone calendar
[09:42:33] <nacin> Looking into attending the conference, as well as getting there early (as I imagine some of you are doing) to help with site launches.
[09:42:38] <gnarf> rwaldron: can you subscribe to a google calendar and have it sync?
[09:42:44] <gnarf> rwaldron: cuz there is the jquery meetings google cal
[09:42:50] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: maybe we can go through open plugins site issues together to figure out where I and others can help
[09:42:52] <rwaldron> oooo
[09:42:58] <rwaldron> gnarf I actually wasnt aware
[09:43:15] <rworth> http://jquery.org/meeting
[09:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: sure, it's pretty small in terms of functionality now.
[09:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues
[09:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> Basically index and search results pages.
[09:43:43] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:43:46] <gnarf> https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=jquery.com_ucvu273d4ae0hl1jloc60th1to@group.calendar.google.com&pli=1 <--- rwaldron
[09:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> I got it converted to a mixture of node-wordpress + grunt-wordpress.
[09:44:17] <jzaefferer> We need some testers asap. Do we have enough staged for a plugin author like ben_alman to play with?
[09:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> Updated package.json format and validation.
[09:44:32] <ben_alman> it's going to be a while before i can "play"
[09:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Not yet, at least not from a staging server.
[09:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's all command line.
[09:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> This is getting off-topic.
[09:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> Let's move to -dev.
[09:45:38] <jzaefferer> Yeah...
[09:45:42] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:45:44] <ben_alman> i'm not looking forward to having to create package.json files and re-tag all my jquery plugin repos just to publish to the site
[09:45:53] <ben_alman> so i'll probably procrastinate just a little
[09:45:55] <ben_alman> :)
[09:46:43] <rwaldron> xml... this makes me not want to do this.
[09:46:49] <rwaldron> wtf :(
[09:47:05] <rwaldron> I need lunch...
[09:47:09] <rwaldron> brb
[09:47:27] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: #jqueryui-dev
