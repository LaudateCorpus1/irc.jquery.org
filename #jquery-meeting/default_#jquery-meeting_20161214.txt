[12:07:32] <arschmitz> hi
[12:07:34] <fnagel> hi
[12:08:06] <jzaefferer> I haven't done anything on UI for a while, so I don't really know what's going on
[12:08:50] <fnagel> last week there was no meeting so...
[12:09:20] <arschmitz> yeah @scott_gonzalez and i have been crushed at work
[12:10:05] <fnagel> ahh ok, just wondered whats going on
[12:10:31] <fnagel> I've pushed a PR with updated QUnit for calendar / datepicker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1777
[12:11:08] <fnagel> perhaps somebody knows why the tests fail due to some spinner widget issues
[12:11:32] <fnagel> "Works on my machine"
[12:52:49] <fnagel> I need to leave soon. If you guys have some ideas, let me know...
