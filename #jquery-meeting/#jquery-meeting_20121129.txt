[10:05:18] <ajpiano> CONTENT MEETING ahoy
[10:05:23] <kswedberg> ahoy!!
[10:05:55] <ajpiano> anyone else around
[10:06:22] <kswedberg> rworth? nacin? scott_gonzalez ?
[10:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> here
[10:06:38] <agcolom> I'm here
[10:06:44] <kswedberg> hi agcolom!
[10:06:48] <nacin> not here - T minus 6 days to 3.5
[10:06:59] <kborchers> lurking
[10:07:16] <ajpiano> sooo
[10:07:24] <kswedberg> ok, nacin. you're off the hook. but I'm still waiting for my jsonp search update for api.jquery.com. :p
[10:07:51] <ajpiano> quick learn site update: we still haven't announced yet
[10:08:00] <ajpiano> going to do it tomorrow regardless of whatever
[10:08:11] <ajpiano> would like to get better tiered navigation in before then
[10:08:31] <ajpiano> but we got the live site up to 3.5 RC 1 so the chapter listing is displaying correctly
[10:09:01] <kswedberg> nice!
[10:09:05] <ajpiano> and we are also now properly displaying contributors in articles
[10:09:15] <ajpiano> using the git file history and the attribution flag in articles
[10:10:07] <ajpiano> which is a nice thing to be able to launch with
[10:10:15] <kswedberg> ajpiano: what's with the reference to /exercises/index.html and /exercises/js/blog.js in http://learn.jquery.com/effects/effects-exercises/ ?
[10:10:39] <ajpiano> kswedberg: that page is gone
[10:10:56] <ajpiano> throw a stage in front of there and you'll see
[10:11:03] <kswedberg> ah, ok! :)
[10:11:51] <ajpiano> outside of learn, we are trying to get new-css ready
[10:12:21] <ajpiano> so we can pull the trigger on that and get, among other things, api.jquery.com launched
[10:12:28] <kswedberg> yay!
[10:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[10:12:42] <ajpiano> rworth has been making some progress but i don't know if we are going to be where we want to be on dec 1st
[10:13:16] <ajpiano> yesterday on dev leads i said i would attempt to jump into the breach next week if necessary but now i may be starting on a client project, so i'm unsure
[10:13:24] <rworth> yeah, I'm doing what I can, but I'm a couple days behind
[10:13:29] <ajpiano> i think we'll just have to evaluate on monday
[10:13:33] <rworth> my holiday travel was extended a tad
[10:14:35] <ajpiano> also, there is one high priority thing that needs to get done, which is re-writing the box on bugs.jquery.com
[10:14:39] <ajpiano> to reflect... the present
[10:15:17] <ajpiano> i'm going to take care of that today or tomorrow, unless DaveMethvin still feels like taking a shot at it
[10:15:23] <ajpiano> :p
[10:15:36] <DaveMethvin> wow, i am JUST doing that ajpiano
[10:15:39] <DaveMethvin> as we speak
[10:15:41] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: awesome
[10:15:45] <DaveMethvin> let me press submit
[10:15:46] <ajpiano> lemme know when it's updated
[10:15:50] <ajpiano> awesome
[10:16:41] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket  stilll needs work but at least it's visible on screen; I need to find out how to avoid it focusing the first form element
[10:17:09] <rworth> $("*").on("focus").blur() ;)
[10:17:19] <ajpiano> the window still will be scrolled :p
[10:17:23] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: main thing to add would be
[10:17:31] <ajpiano> for bugs with the the jQuery Website
[10:17:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't think the wiki site lets me add script
[10:17:56] <DaveMethvin> but let me stop hijacking this meeting, ping me after :D
[10:18:02] <ajpiano> ok
[10:18:12] <ajpiano> well there's my thought anyway :p
[10:18:59] <kswedberg> ajpiano: is there a guide for giving proper attribution on the learn site?
[10:19:29] <kswedberg> like if the article was originally published on someone else's blog?
[10:19:35] <ajpiano> it's in the style guide
[10:19:43] <kswedberg> awesome. thx!
[10:19:53] <ajpiano> if it was initially published by someone else, you put source and attribution
[10:20:03] <ajpiano> and that gets pushed to the top of the list
[10:20:13] <ajpiano> i'm not *linking* to the old resource though, except for jquery fundamentals
[10:20:29] <kswedberg> ok.
[10:20:44] <agcolom> ajpiano: your changes in web-base-template need to be brought in I think (I'm still seeing that FF problem)
[10:20:47] <ajpiano> seems weird to link to a similar outdated version of an article you're already on
[10:20:55] <ajpiano> agcolom: yeah we haven't updated live in a few days
[10:21:15] <ajpiano> rworth: what do you think of the aesthetics of the contributors block right now
[10:21:27] <ajpiano> it is neither the best nor is it the worst
[10:22:16] <rworth> yeah, it looks ok
[10:22:28] <rworth> can we link to people's github accounts?
[10:22:54] <ajpiano>  i don't think we have their github usernames
[10:23:06] <ajpiano> i mean, i know we don't
[10:24:02] <ajpiano> so for now i think the answer is no
[10:24:11] <rworth> oh that's right, we only get name and email
[10:24:15] <rworth> ok, it's fine yeah
[10:25:45] <ajpiano> i think that's all i have for learn... it's a work in progress, we have to take the veil off sometime :)
[10:26:35] <rworth> should jQuery Fundamentals have the jQuery logo?
[10:26:44] <ajpiano> i asked rebecca yesterday
[10:26:45] <rworth> that was my only concern when I first saw the box
[10:26:53] <ajpiano> it never had a logo
[10:26:57] <ajpiano> so i wasn't sure what to use
[10:27:01] <ajpiano> she said jq logo was fine w/ her
[10:27:09] <ajpiano> that's what i had been using months ago
[10:27:09] <rworth> seems… weird
[10:27:13] <ajpiano> not sure what else to use
[10:27:16] <rworth> right
[10:27:33] <rworth> I guess I could go either way
[10:27:40] <rworth> just wanted to see where there origins of it were
[10:28:06] <ajpiano> it's hardcoded https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L133-L134
[10:28:13] <ajpiano> so if we wantt to use something else we can
[10:28:24] <rworth> right. I mean origins like why and when and how we decided on it, or if it had it before
[10:28:28] <rworth> yup
[10:28:53] <ajpiano> rworth: cause it wasn't *only* rebecca who worked on jqf
[10:29:00] <ajpiano> and since it doesn't have a logo of its own
[10:29:02] <rworth> caus if it had had it before (or even now) it would be a trademark violation
[10:29:07] <ajpiano> there isn't really a good answer as to what to show
[10:29:38] <rworth> of course it's not a violation if we approve it
[10:29:44] <ajpiano> "jquery fundamentals" doesn't have a jquery logo in it at all
[10:29:50] <rworth> right
[10:29:51] <ajpiano> we're just shoing a jquery logo next to it
[10:29:52] <ajpiano> on our site
[10:29:56] <rworth> that's why it seems weird
[10:29:59] <rworth> yeah, I understand
[10:30:04] <ajpiano> do you have any other ideas
[10:30:19] <ajpiano> we could not show an image at all
[10:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> A picture of David Mark?
[10:30:45] <rworth> a book icon?
[10:31:17] <ajpiano> that is clever
[10:31:29] <ajpiano> would work
[10:32:02] <ajpiano> though i don't think we should chase our own tail around too much in terms of attempting to figure out whether we're violating our own copyright by putting our own logo next to the title of a legacy content that was itself donated to us
[10:32:09] <ajpiano> jussayin
[10:32:32] <rworth> well, it was donated to us but not assigned to us
[10:32:45] <rworth> not trying to minimize the contribution
[10:32:51] <ajpiano> i realise that
[10:32:58] <ajpiano> but we're going to iron out the technical side of it
[10:32:59] <rworth> but the donation wasn't more than what's allowed by the original license
[10:33:02] <rworth> yup
[10:33:56] <ajpiano> so let's decide on that finally after we talk to rebeca bout it
[10:33:59] <ajpiano> book icon is fine with me
[10:34:28] <rworth> let's just stick a book icon there in the meantime, the swoops on their own just worry me in terms of our coming trademark use guidelines
[10:34:52] <ajpiano> i think we should probably find someone else to target with those guidelines besdies us
[10:34:57] <rworth> again, we can do what we don't allow others to do, but we should take care in that
[10:35:10] <ajpiano> yep
[10:35:36] <ajpiano> alright
[10:35:37] <ajpiano> moving on
[10:35:46] <ajpiano> anyone got anything they want to bring up from API docs etc
[10:36:13] <kswedberg> nothin here
[10:36:15] <agcolom> all fine on my side...
[10:36:44] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to make sure that rworth is moving the common API stylings to the correct location when doing the new-css migration.
[10:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> Since master has common styles either duplicated across themes or only implemented in api.jqueryui.com.
[10:37:19] <rworth> actually I wanted to discuss this (or something like it)
[10:37:24] <agcolom> oh yes...
[10:37:27] <rworth> we currently have 2 stylesheets per site
[10:37:30] <rworth> base.css for all sites
[10:37:43] <rworth> that's shared
[10:37:50] <ajpiano> i will be back in 3 mins, contine w/o me obvi
[10:37:51] <rworth> and a sep. style.css per site/theme
[10:38:26] <rworth> for something like API where 3-5 sites will use the same style(s), should we just put that in base, in an API section?
[10:38:35] <rworth> caus adding a 3rd sheet seems a bit much
[10:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> Moving them to base seems fine, we can always get them into a 3rd file that goes away with a build process later.
[10:39:17] <kswedberg> ideally we'd concat the stylesheets
[10:39:22] <rworth> ok
[10:39:48] <rworth> we'll do that for now. when base gets too big we'll come up with some other solution like that. That's what I was thinking
[10:39:49] <rworth> thanks
[10:39:58] <rworth> so, yeah, I'll consolidate all the api styles into base
[10:39:59] <kswedberg> +1
[10:40:56] <agcolom> thanks!
[10:42:01] <ajpiano> imagine if there was some kind of crazy "css preprocessor" that would allow for this type of style sharing
[10:42:02] <ajpiano> :p
[10:42:37] <kswedberg> :D
[10:42:38] <ajpiano> well, now that i've trolled my own meeting... i think we can wrap up
[10:42:54] <ajpiano> the important part is we're gonna get 1.8 on jquery.com
[10:43:08] <ajpiano> everything else is small potatoes compared to that
[10:43:49] <ajpiano> alright, see everyone in #jquery-content
[10:44:14] <ajpiano> gonna leave the chan open for now as mobile is starting in 15 minutes anyway
[10:44:21] <ajpiano> it's all yours toddmparker :)
[10:44:22] <kswedberg> bye
[11:03:43] <toddmparker__> Hi all
[11:03:49] <RWhitbeck> Hello
[11:03:57] <toddmparker__> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:04:02] <toddmparker__> chime in if you're here
[11:04:08] <toddmparker__> (hey RWhitbeck)
[11:04:11] <jlembeck> hey
[11:04:22] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:04:23] <toddmparker__> agenda here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lhOuwXgrFqfrc2SrHvfv9KcyGX69rkNnxLz0wVoJENU/edit#
[11:04:26] <agcolom> hi!
[11:04:35] <toddmparker__> hi agcolom, arschmitz, jlembeck
[11:05:04] <toddmparker__> guess we need johnbender, _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi
[11:05:06] <toddmparker__> and JasonDScott__
[11:05:17] <uGoMobi> I am here
[11:05:29] <johnbender> bingo
[11:06:01] <agcolom> JasonDScott__ is in Bangkok I think for BBJam asia
[11:06:07] <toddmparker__> ah, ok
[11:06:47] <RWhitbeck> Sounds like that would hurt … badum ching
[11:06:59] <toddmparker__> hehe
[11:07:14] <johnbender> ZING RWhitbeck!
[11:07:16] <johnbender> :) :)
[11:07:19] <toddmparker__> ok, we can start. maybe _|Nix|_ will hop on in a bit
[11:07:25] <toddmparker__> my update is quick
[11:07:39] <toddmparker__> Good progress on 1.3: 14 open issues / 36 closed - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&sort=updated&state=open
[11:07:39] <toddmparker__> Sliding panel widget work underway in a branch, will need docs and demos soon
[11:07:48] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:07:49] <toddmparker__> ^ Jeff can talk about panels in a bit
[11:07:53] <toddmparker__> hey _|Nix|_ !
[11:08:09] <toddmparker__> I will focus on release notes for 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 this week so we can get those released
[11:08:20] <toddmparker__> jlembeck has a script I can use for that
[11:08:34] <toddmparker__> Next: new demos site to compliment new API site
[11:08:48] <agcolom> yes!
[11:08:53] <toddmparker__> Collecting a rough set of demo pages here - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[11:09:29] <toddmparker__> Hoping we're on track for a beta of 1.3 by the end of the year. Seems reasonable.
[11:09:40] <jlembeck> awesome.
[11:09:55] <toddmparker__> 1.4 is looking like it will be heavy on re-factoring for speed, consistency and performance
[11:10:09] <johnbender> provided John "Douchebag" Bender doesn't hold things up
[11:10:22] <toddmparker__> yeah, DB
[11:10:40] <toddmparker__> don't derail this train
[11:10:46] <toddmparker__> :p
[11:10:53] <johnbender> I'm tryin not to I promise
[11:10:58] <johnbender> that's why it's taking so long
[11:11:03] <johnbender> The Kinks
[11:11:06] <toddmparker__> speaking of johnbender - wanna give us an update on your nav work?
[11:11:08] <johnbender> yes
[11:11:10] <RWhitbeck> toddmparker_ will we be focusing more on using jQM with RWD techniques in 1.3 or 1.4?  I can't remember what you said.  How are we going to do that?  Tutorials?
[11:11:11] <johnbender> 3 yests left
[11:11:13] <johnbender> tests
[11:11:17] <johnbender> for the whole sweet
[11:11:25] <johnbender> suite
[11:11:27] <johnbender> good lord
[11:11:30] <toddmparker__> heh
[11:11:41] <johnbender> but things are looking good
[11:11:58] <johnbender> once I get it merged there's some refactoring of my refactoring to do :x
[11:12:03] <johnbender> but not much
[11:12:19] <toddmparker__> cool
[11:12:21] <johnbender> been working on internal stuff alot recently
[11:12:27] <johnbender> so that's why it's not merged already
[11:12:28] <johnbender> :(
[11:12:34] <toddmparker__> internal = adobe?
[11:12:49] <johnbender> yessir
[11:12:52] <johnbender> Vagrant stuff
[11:13:08] <johnbender> which I'm the authority on for god knows what reason :)
[11:13:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You're the vagrant authority? :)
[11:13:34] <johnbender> haha
[11:13:40] <johnbender> indeed!
[11:14:26] <jlembeck> probably a reason or two behind that.
[11:14:49] <toddmparker__> sounds like vagrant is going to be able to move forward even faster now
[11:15:01] <johnbender> yah super excited for Mitch
[11:15:13] <johnbender> he's work insanely hard on that project
[11:15:17] <johnbender> *worked
[11:15:19] <toddmparker__> yeah, great news
[11:15:22] <toddmparker__> i bet
[11:16:02] <toddmparker__> johnbender: is there a quick way to summarize what part sof you nav you're working on for 1.3?
[11:16:11] <johnbender> yes
[11:16:17] <johnbender> do you want me to write something up?
[11:16:18] <toddmparker__> I have seen a few Q"s about that
[11:16:20] <johnbender> I'v got my writing hat on
[11:16:30] <toddmparker__> sure, probably too hard to wing it here
[11:16:37] * johnbender thinks his typing hat must have fallen off though
[11:16:41] <toddmparker__> be helpful for the blog post too
[11:16:50] <johnbender> toddmparker__: kk, I'll do a paragraph
[11:16:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, you're gonna use pen and paper?
[11:16:56] <toddmparker__> cool
[11:17:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm no hipster ?:)
[11:17:22] <toddmparker__> for example, will the separation of nav into more of a standard plugin out of the core stuff be for 1.4?
[11:17:42] <toddmparker__> or the start of that process anyway
[11:18:11] <toddmparker__> johnbender ^
[11:18:51] <johnbender> toddmparker__: it can start now
[11:18:52] <johnbender> at 1.3
[11:18:55] <toddmparker__> cool
[11:18:57] <johnbender> if we're comfortable with the api shape
[11:19:00] <johnbender> that was my goal
[11:19:05] <johnbender> and part of why it was so hard
[11:19:15] <johnbender> value for the user + value for the project
[11:19:15] <toddmparker__> it'll probably be a multi-part thing. groundwork now, more in 1.4
[11:19:20] <toddmparker__> right.
[11:19:26] <johnbender> yes, it's a start
[11:19:32] <johnbender> and a good one I think
[11:19:38] <toddmparker__> nice
[11:19:42] <toddmparker__> thanks johnbender
[11:19:51] <toddmparker__> RWhitbeck re: RWD
[11:20:06] <toddmparker__> 1.3 will be chock full of RWD stuff
[11:20:16] <toddmparker__> RWD intro started (very basic): http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/grids/rwd-basics.html
[11:20:16] <toddmparker__> Responsive grids w/default breakpoint: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/grids/grid-stack.html
[11:20:16] <toddmparker__> Responsive tables: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/tables/index.html
[11:21:08] <toddmparker__> the panels will also have a responsive element where we could have a demo showing how we could display a panel and hide the open/close button above a certain width
[11:21:15] <RWhitbeck> awesome.  I'd love to know how I can help preach the good word on RWD.   Let me know how I can help
[11:21:41] <toddmparker__> i need to flesh out the into with best practices
[11:21:59] <toddmparker__> that could be moved over to the learn site if we think that will be more visible
[11:22:19] <toddmparker__> we're going to be building more responsive demos too
[11:23:12] <toddmparker__> widgets like tables and grids will have a single, optional preset breakpoint people can opt into via a class and we'll use demos and docs to teach people how to customize for their needs
[11:23:52] <toddmparker__> scroll to the bottom here to see a bunch of more customized RWD table demos - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[11:24:11] <toddmparker__> each have a style block so you can see how we customzed
[11:24:30] <toddmparker__> i'd like to coordinate w/you on this more though.
[11:24:40] <toddmparker__> RWhitbeck: want to go next?
[11:25:19] <RWhitbeck> Sure
[11:25:56] <RWhitbeck> I've been heading up a community effort to write a book for O'Reilly called the jQuery Mobile Cookbook.  More info here http://jquerymobilecookbook.com
[11:26:59] <RWhitbeck> Have good momentum now.  HAve a few dozen authors that have contributed and looking for more.   Hoping to have this published first half of next year ideally
[11:27:31] <RWhitbeck> I am also working on putting together some jQuery Mobile talks that I can submit to conferences so that I can work on preaching jQuery Mobile's good word.
[11:27:34] <toddmparker__> been seeing a lot of commits to the cookbook
[11:28:01] <toddmparker__> roughly how far along is it?
[11:28:03] <RWhitbeck> yeah it's been great
[11:28:17] <RWhitbeck> about 40-50%
[11:28:35] <RWhitbeck> here is my presentation slides from jQuery Asia https://speakerdeck.com/rwhitbeck/in-depth-look-at-jquery-mobile
[11:28:43] <toddmparker__> ok, great. momentum is back
[11:29:13] <toddmparker__> woudl you be interested in helping with mobile support on the #jquery channel
[11:29:29] <RWhitbeck> had a interesting question come from that.  How are we going to handle tablets that are 10" or greater.  I suggested that we'd be talking about RWD techniques but wasn't sure if we had an official answer.
[11:29:30] <toddmparker__> or forums?
[11:29:47] <johnbender> you guys and your keynote slides
[11:29:52] <RWhitbeck> sure I can jump in there.
[11:29:54] <toddmparker__> yeah, all the widgets are 100% flexible
[11:29:54] <johnbender> my next preso is going to be pretty
[11:29:56] <johnbender> I swear
[11:30:05] <toddmparker__> and we're building some RWD stuff in, like for tables
[11:30:27] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: there is no real size restrictions currently
[11:30:40] <toddmparker__> to support a broad range of devices, people really need to write some media queries that make sense for their design and content
[11:30:53] <toddmparker__> we'll help with docs and demos to show the way
[11:31:02] <RWhitbeck> ok so I was on par with my answer
[11:31:07] <toddmparker__> right now, things will stretch out to 100%
[11:31:10] <toddmparker__> yeah
[11:31:24] <RWhitbeck> ok I am done.
[11:31:29] <agcolom> we can also write tutorials in the jquery mobile section of the learn site (being released very soon)
[11:31:46] <RWhitbeck> yeah I plan on contributing to that when I get some air
[11:31:51] <toddmparker__> problem is, it's hard to library-ize a lot of RWD layouts. some people try, but I think it's a mistake.
[11:32:03] <toddmparker__> and writing a few media queries is easy
[11:32:06] <_|Nix|_> I have an idea re: responsive stuff: Is there a systematic way of doing stuff like this: if the width is greater than x, you get widget y, otherwise you get widget z.
[11:32:46] <toddmparker__> swapping widgets is an interesting one
[11:33:01] <johnbender> That sounds like something you could plug into a container
[11:33:08] <agcolom> what happens when people rotate the device?
[11:33:12] <toddmparker__> classic example would be a horizontal navbar that swaps to a menu
[11:33:45] <toddmparker__> agcolom: rotating the device is the same as re-sizing the browser so if you cross a breakpoint, it will adapt
[11:33:55] <agcolom> ok.
[11:33:58] <_|Nix|_> The naïve way is to instantiate both, and hide one. Then, upon orientation change, hide it and reveal the other one.
[11:35:03] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ... just a thought ...
[11:35:17] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: i think this is an interesting pattern to explore
[11:35:37] <arschmitz> a widget to swp widgets !
[11:35:41] <arschmitz> swap
[11:35:53] <_|Nix|_> I guess the same way that the solution for MQs is to educate, the solution for widgets that are responsive in the way I describe is also app-level, rather than framework-level.
[11:35:57] <toddmparker__> one option is to bake this into a widget so a navbar can have a point where it becomes a menu
[11:36:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: That's the other option.
[11:36:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Not sure if that'll complicate our widgets much.
[11:36:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: pure CSS you mean?
[11:36:51] <toddmparker__> there are a lot of things to think about - whether content is duplicated, source order, ARIA
[11:37:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I doubt that's possible. Maybe if the DOM structure can be kept identical between the two looks.
[11:37:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree
[11:37:43] <toddmparker__> you can swap from a navbar to menu with the same html and different css
[11:38:09] <uGoMobi> yes, swapping between widget will difficult though
[11:38:28] <toddmparker__> but i can see other situations where you might need to literally destroy widget A and call widget B on the same markup. might be too complex to build that in and instead make some demos
[11:39:03] <toddmparker__> this all seems like demo territory
[11:39:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Actually, if wew properly implement _destroy(), like we're planning for 1.4, we'll be well along towards that goal - assuming performance doesn't kill us.
[11:39:18] <toddmparker__> right
[11:39:38] <arschmitz> i have some ideas on this we should talk about _|Nix|_ too much for in here i think though
[11:39:41] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: you want to go next?
[11:39:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Yeah, demos - definitely. Those should help us identify what, if anything needs to go into the framework.
[11:39:53] <toddmparker__> right
[11:40:03] <_|Nix|_> Sure, I'll go next.
[11:40:09] <RWhitbeck> Worry that some of these ideas will make the library heavier in file size.
[11:40:24] <_|Nix|_> So, I fixed a bunch of bugs. I also partially fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009 (active state for buttons).
[11:40:44] <toddmparker__> saw that - great
[11:40:55] <_|Nix|_> enhanced native buttons now get the active state, if the form they're a part of is AJAX-submitted.
[11:41:09] <toddmparker__> cool
[11:41:26] <toddmparker__> seems like we can't really go much further on this, can we?
[11:41:27] <_|Nix|_> Then, I have a bunch of stuff pending on the nav refactor ...
[11:41:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Not without a major design discussion.
[11:42:03] <toddmparker__> so i'd close and say that's as far we we'll go
[11:42:18] <_|Nix|_> One dicy thing is that nav completely dies if a pageshow handler throws an error.
[11:42:45] <toddmparker__> oh, _|Nix|_ one thing I just remembered: for popup, the new option should be "dismissible" not "dismissable"
[11:43:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Is that the officially correct spelling? Like dirigible?
[11:43:11] <toddmparker__> hopefully a quick change
[11:43:13] <toddmparker__> yeah :)
[11:43:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Just out of curiosity: where'd you find that?
[11:43:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I looked everywhere for an authority on the spelling ...
[11:43:44] <uGoMobi> maybe we should add spell checker to unit tests :)
[11:43:44] <toddmparker__> http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dismissible
[11:43:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Cool.
[11:43:58] <toddmparker__> google corrected jlembeck and that's how we got clued in
[11:44:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Oh, really! Cool!
[11:44:13] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: heh, seriously.
[11:44:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: OK. dismissible it is.
[11:44:19] <toddmparker__> thanks google
[11:44:29] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:45:00] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: re: "nav completely dies if a pageshow handler throws an error."
[11:45:11] <_|Nix|_> Then I had an idea for making history change preventable via pagebeforechange - but that's assuming johnbender's refactor doesn't already make that possible.
[11:45:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Yeah.
[11:45:17] <toddmparker__> johnbender - is that something you can look at with _|Nix|_
[11:45:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Had a discussion with the core guys.
[11:45:25] <toddmparker__> seems bad
[11:45:32] <toddmparker__> and...
[11:45:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: This is a fundamental problem with callback-based event handling systems.
[11:45:45] <toddmparker__> ah
[11:46:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: When the browser fires an event, it'll tear down the whole stack frame handling that event upon error.
[11:46:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: The solution? one event handler per event.
[11:46:29] <toddmparker__> that workable?
[11:46:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: So, if you have 5 handlers bound to an event, you emit 5 fake events when you receive the real event, and hook one of the five handlers up to each of the fake events.
[11:46:54] <toddmparker__> actually, seems like a good to to discuss offline, esp with johnbender and core
[11:46:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Workable, but performance is 0.
[11:47:00] <toddmparker__> eh
[11:47:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Core will have none of it.
[11:47:12] <toddmparker__> i see why
[11:47:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it does make it possible
[11:47:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Yeah, that's insane.
[11:47:20] <johnbender> we can chat
[11:47:23] <johnbender> it's used in popup
[11:47:25] <toddmparker__> ok
[11:47:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, let's talk after.
[11:47:37] <toddmparker__> anything else _|Nix|_
[11:47:44] <_|Nix|_> That's about it.
[11:47:47] <toddmparker__> cool
[11:47:51] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi?
[11:47:55] <_|Nix|_> I'll try and repro that table failure.
[11:47:56] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:47:58] <_|Nix|_> In the unit tests.
[11:48:12] <uGoMobi> textinput clear button landed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1834
[11:48:12] <uGoMobi> fixed iOS preventFocusZoom issue iOS
[11:48:12] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5333
[11:48:12] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3690
[11:48:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry.
[11:48:23] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: thanks - jlembeck can help fix that if you can narrow down
[11:48:36] <uGoMobi> np
[11:48:41] <uGoMobi> made some changes to demo source code view: max height + scroll, better performance
[11:48:58] <toddmparker__> i'll need to check those demo changes out
[11:49:10] <uGoMobi> scroll doesn't work on mobile so i should add a MQ
[11:49:15] <toddmparker__> do we have demos for the clear button feature?
[11:49:28] <uGoMobi> almost... hang on
[11:49:34] <toddmparker__> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/textinput/index.html
[11:49:35] <toddmparker__> ?
[11:49:57] <toddmparker__> those work nicely
[11:50:13] <uGoMobi> I will clean up that page
[11:50:16] <toddmparker__> is that 2nd example of the false clear button doing much? it's the default, right?
[11:50:28] <toddmparker__> but that's a nice page to demo it
[11:50:56] <uGoMobi> yes no clear btn is default
[11:51:04] <toddmparker__> right
[11:51:31] <uGoMobi> wasn't sure if we needed so many clear button examples
[11:51:33] <toddmparker__> so maybe only search needs the false example since that defaults to true
[11:51:44] <uGoMobi> I mean... with and without fieldcontain, etc.
[11:51:47] <toddmparker__> probably only need 1-2 true examples
[11:51:51] <toddmparker__> yeah
[11:52:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: you can't disable it on search
[11:52:14] <toddmparker__> yeah?
[11:52:27] <uGoMobi> didn't we discuss that on -dev
[11:52:28] <toddmparker__> might be nice for consistency
[11:52:30] <toddmparker__> sure
[11:52:40] <toddmparker__> Textarea: data-clear-btn="true" >> not needed, not supported
[11:52:41] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:52:49] <toddmparker__> that is a nice feature
[11:52:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you remember what we discussed?
[11:53:18] <arschmitz> type="search" has a native clear button so it always should
[11:53:19] <uGoMobi> but we can add the option for search, np
[11:53:29] <toddmparker__> cool
[11:53:46] <toddmparker__> more consistent that way, just different defaults
[11:53:50] <uGoMobi> I am adding few textinput examples to other form demo pages too
[11:54:02] <toddmparker__> oh, do we have an issue for the range slider tagged for 1.3?
[11:54:07] <uGoMobi> that's true
[11:54:07] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: great
[11:54:22] <uGoMobi> not sure what to do with these Symbian issues (can we reproduce? should we degrade?)
[11:54:22] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&labels=Symbian&milestone=&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:54:34] <uGoMobi> not high priority issues
[11:54:34] <toddmparker__> if not, we should and link up the prototypes such
[11:54:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker: not currently but i can add one
[11:55:01] <uGoMobi> but if we want to degrade we should to it in main release
[11:55:09] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: on symbian, the problem is that the page dies = blank screen?
[11:55:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have a Series 60 phone - just need to charge it.
[11:55:24] <uGoMobi> yes that was the series 40
[11:55:37] <uGoMobi> series 40 is proxy browser
[11:55:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK. Series 40 ...
[11:55:53] <uGoMobi> but also crashing on series 60
[11:56:12] <toddmparker__> i'd lean towards playing it safer with symbian and only letting the newer series 60 versions in and having 40 and older 60 be C grade
[11:56:17] <uGoMobi> series 440 is C grade but still blank page
[11:56:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK ... well, since they're low prio, we should probably wait until after 1.3 ... although I think we'll be knee-deep in refactors fater that so, I dunno ...
[11:56:35] <toddmparker__> the 2-3 symbian 60's I tested worked great at the office
[11:56:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If these issues linger much longer, Series (40|60) will disappear off the radar.
[11:57:05] <uGoMobi> I am fine with deciding to leave this for now
[11:57:12] <toddmparker__> be good to find a way to detect 40 and force C grade (don't enhance)
[11:57:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker its not even all c grade
[11:57:34] <toddmparker__> i just hate having stuff not be accessible
[11:57:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: it should be that way already but just loading the JS makes that browser crash already
[11:57:44] <toddmparker__> right
[11:57:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: I agree
[11:57:51] <arschmitz> i mean all series 40
[11:58:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, then there's not much we can do.
[11:58:16] <arschmitz> its only series 40 5th edition
[11:58:17] <toddmparker__> we had to spend a ton of time getting symbian to work for 1.0
[11:58:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can only affect things via JS.
[11:58:32] <toddmparker__> it would error out and die and there was no way to track it down
[11:58:33] <arschmitz> 4th and 6th edition series 40 are fine
[11:58:39] <toddmparker__> we did eventually (we think)
[11:58:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, we could <script src="jquery.mobile.js" style="display: hidden;"></script> :)
[11:58:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe it is the support tests that cause the problem
[11:58:58] <toddmparker__> it could be that it's choking on core for all we know
[11:59:09] <toddmparker__> yeah, could be anything
[11:59:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it's crashing inside our code. OK.
[11:59:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's traceable.
[11:59:34] <uGoMobi> I had that guy tested out support tests
[11:59:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: alert() is your friend :)
[11:59:42] <uGoMobi> but that didn't work
[11:59:45] <toddmparker__> do we spin up core or only if a browser passes
[12:00:03] <uGoMobi> ok _|Nix|_ shall we discuss on -dev next week?
[12:00:05] <johnbender> looking
[12:00:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[12:00:19] <toddmparker__> let's keep an eye on this in -dev
[12:00:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:00:29] <uGoMobi> now working on slider CSS (full width), also for new range widget
[12:00:29] <uGoMobi> will push demos for new options (dialog close button, etc.), table styling, and methods (API docs) this week
[12:00:29] <uGoMobi> continue working on new docs for 1.3
[12:00:29] <uGoMobi> discuss structure and content with Todd and Anne
[12:00:29] <uGoMobi> make “real world” and RWD demos
[12:00:39] <johnbender> toddmparker__: the core file is spun up
[12:00:42] <johnbender> the check is in init
[12:00:44] <toddmparker__> i see
[12:00:52] <johnbender> by then there are a lot of js objects
[12:00:57] <toddmparker__> so it could be core or our support stuff
[12:01:07] <toddmparker__> lot of code to interpret
[12:01:19] <johnbender> yah
[12:01:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: alert( "I am not dead yet." );
[12:01:30] <toddmparker__> wish we had a symbian expert
[12:01:40] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: seriosuly, we did that for days
[12:01:48] <uGoMobi> pfff
[12:02:05] <toddmparker__> thanks uGoMobi
[12:02:15] <toddmparker__> arschmitz: wanna go?
[12:02:19] <arschmitz> Sure
[12:03:40] <arschmitz> re-wrote the swipe event to allow it to be extended to allow fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2328
[12:04:22] <arschmitz> and then wrote an extension to demonstrate this / fix ^^
[12:04:35] <toddmparker__> that is hot
[12:04:47] <toddmparker__> where is that demo?
[12:05:01] <arschmitz> agcolom: i know you just documented swipe this will add a little more to it
[12:05:08] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix/blob/master/swipefix.js
[12:05:22] <agcolom> Cool thanks!
[12:05:27] <arschmitz> i didnt make a page using it for the docs yet or anything just wrote the extension
[12:06:13] <toddmparker__> so do you want to add info on how to extend in the API docs then use this extension in the new demos site? just trying to figure out where we should put things
[12:06:57] <toddmparker__> think it's kosher to just link to that file from the api docs?
[12:07:09] <toddmparker__> anyway, worth thinking about and coordinating with agcolom
[12:07:09] <arschmitz> that was my thought
[12:07:17] <arschmitz> then we dont have to support it
[12:07:18] <toddmparker__> ok, that works I think
[12:07:26] <toddmparker__> yes, that's the idea :)
[12:07:47] <arschmitz> just document the hooks and link to the demo extension
[12:08:12] <toddmparker__> cool
[12:08:28] <toddmparker__> we can also make a real demo page in demos that shows this in action
[12:08:55] <arschmitz> while working on this and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5035
[12:09:10] <arschmitz> i noticed we are missing the teardown methods for our touch events
[12:09:20] <toddmparker__> yep
[12:09:24] <toddmparker__> that a 1.4 thing
[12:09:30] <arschmitz> yes but i had one thought
[12:09:50] <arschmitz> this could have some pretty serious performance implications currently if people use these events a lot
[12:10:02] <arschmitz> because none of the internal event bindings are ever unbound
[12:10:51] <arschmitz> was wondering what other people thought about the seriousness of this?
[12:10:53] <toddmparker__> so maybe it's not good to promote this too heavily
[12:11:15] <toddmparker__> worth building a test page and testing on real devices
[12:11:24] <toddmparker__> i have an original iphone
[12:11:33] <arschmitz> no i mean the way it is now could be potentially really bad not fixing it
[12:11:57] <toddmparker__> oh, i see
[12:12:10] <toddmparker__> let's discuss that in dev then
[12:12:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: worst case open a ticket
[12:12:32] <johnbender> we can discuss there for posterity
[12:12:37] <toddmparker__> dual handle slider stuff looking good...sounds like you and uGoMobi are collaborating on that
[12:12:49] <arschmitz> yes first draft of range is in a branch
[12:12:58] <arschmitz> gallery http://www.uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html
[12:13:10] <toddmparker__> +1 for discuss that swipe stuff in a ticket
[12:13:10] <_|Nix|_> Dual-hanlde ... why does that sound like dual wield? :)
[12:13:13] <uGoMobi> I will make sure slider and range CSS are compatible
[12:13:19] <toddmparker__> slick
[12:13:31] <toddmparker__> yeah, between the two of you, this will be perfect
[12:13:34] <arschmitz> made all range essentially full width for better usability
[12:13:38] <toddmparker__> nice feature
[12:14:14] <uGoMobi> for 1.4 we can do the vertical ones :)
[12:14:17] <toddmparker__> yeah, i don't think there is enough room for two inputs + slider on one line
[12:14:32] <toddmparker__> yeah, and dragging the fill of a range to shift it
[12:14:49] <toddmparker__> and supporting 8 slider handles
[12:14:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: you said something about hiding inputs on tap?
[12:14:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Is that finger-friendly.
[12:14:57] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:15:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: The trough is pretty narrow.
[12:15:31] <agcolom> could the input fields be below the sliders?
[12:15:38] <toddmparker__> oh, i was just suggesting that it might be cool to have the option to tack on a class to make the inputs smaller so they feel better on the same line as the input
[12:15:52] <toddmparker__> agcolom: worth thinking about
[12:16:03] <arschmitz> right now on small width screens the slider always goes to its own line
[12:16:16] <arschmitz> on wide screens you have a number of layout options
[12:16:16] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:16:23] <toddmparker__> label: 50 - 100 << where the two numbers are tappable, but less padding, less visual noice
[12:16:33] <toddmparker__> noise
[12:16:33] <uGoMobi> for consistency we might want to do the same for regular slider
[12:16:40] <toddmparker__> sure
[12:16:58] <toddmparker__> i know some people choose to hide the input because it's pretty chunky
[12:17:19] <toddmparker__> but if we styled them to to smaller and more subtle, but still active they might be nicer
[12:17:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker__:its something to think about for sure
[12:17:59] <toddmparker__> better to make 'em smaller but still function as feedback and an optional way to input
[12:18:08] <toddmparker__> yeah, might not work well, who knows
[12:18:15] <uGoMobi> we also have those demos https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045
[12:18:22] <toddmparker__> but we have the flexibility to have an alt style for those
[12:18:23] <uGoMobi> tooltip style
[12:18:52] <toddmparker__> like: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/vyy65/15/show/light/
[12:18:57] <toddmparker__> those are nice
[12:19:10] <uGoMobi> yeah sorry, copied wrong link
[12:19:12] <toddmparker__> don't think we'd need both the value under and the tooltip
[12:19:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#slider-demo
[12:19:21] <toddmparker__> i'd probably just do the value under
[12:19:35] <uGoMobi> I agree one is enough
[12:19:45] <toddmparker__> oh, i like that
[12:19:55] <uGoMobi> oh thats cool _|Nix|_
[12:19:56] <toddmparker__> the _|Nix|_ version
[12:19:58] <arschmitz> those look nice
[12:20:04] <agcolom> I love those examples@
[12:20:07] <toddmparker__> CASE CLOASED
[12:20:31] <uGoMobi> does that "popup" work on touch _|Nix|_ ?
[12:20:40] <uGoMobi> second example
[12:20:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pretty sure.
[12:20:52] <toddmparker__> that doesn't really work well for using inputs as the alt way to enter a value, but it's cool for showing the number
[12:21:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker__: good demo but not feature nessasarrily
[12:21:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/tree/master/src/widgets/slider/js
[12:21:33] <toddmparker__> nice demo for sure
[12:21:41] <toddmparker__> let's not forget that one
[12:21:49] <uGoMobi> ok so our structure CSS should have the flexibility to make it easy to do custom styling like those demos
[12:22:04] <toddmparker__> so seems like we can do some more cool stuff with sliders...let's keep working on this in dev
[12:22:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/blob/master/src/widgets/slider/js/slider.js more precisely.
[12:22:24] <toddmparker__> is there an issue for the range slider? if not, can arschmitz add one and link this stuff up?
[12:22:28] <uGoMobi> ok great _|Nix|_
[12:22:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Feel free to copy. The intention was to upstream that to jQM anyway.
[12:22:40] <toddmparker__> i do like that 2nd example
[12:22:44] <arschmitz> there isnt but i will
[12:22:47] <uGoMobi> me too
[12:22:51] <toddmparker__> thanks arschmitz
[12:23:18] <toddmparker__> man, lots of good stuff being built now
[12:23:35] <toddmparker__> arschmitz: that it for you?
[12:23:42] <arschmitz> yup im done
[12:23:50] <toddmparker__> we're over so i want to hit jlembeck and agcolom
[12:24:04] <toddmparker__> who's first?
[12:24:07] <jlembeck> I can go
[12:24:18] <jlembeck> Slide-panel is mostly workable now. Missing a few tests. Still needs tests for dismissible, and needs implementation for transitions and _destroy.
[12:24:18] <jlembeck> Work happening here in a branch: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel/docs/panels/index.html
[12:24:55] <jlembeck> I'm refactoring and debugging still, but will likely have this wrapped up today.
[12:25:21] <toddmparker__> looks like we need to pull off the active state on those buttons
[12:25:39] <jlembeck> Indeed.
[12:26:22] <jlembeck> Before I dig into finding the best way to do that, is there something simple that anybody around here has done (looking at you _|Nix|_)?
[12:26:24] <toddmparker__> i think we may want to make sure to add a class to the button that has the panel state so people can style the button differently when the panel is open/closed
[12:26:43] <jlembeck> hmm.. for menu situations?
[12:26:52] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: What buttons?
[12:26:53] <jlembeck> I can dig that.
[12:27:07] <toddmparker__> ui-panel-btn-open and ui-panel-btn-closed
[12:27:16] <jlembeck> when you were setting up popup
[12:27:18] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: the button you use to open the panel
[12:27:22] <jlembeck> and you had a link to open it
[12:27:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I see it.
[12:27:32] <toddmparker__> is similar to the popup
[12:27:38] <jlembeck> did you just remove the active state class?
[12:27:46] <jlembeck> or is there something... better.. than that?
[12:27:51] <jlembeck> (haven't looked)
[12:27:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Your best bet is to let nav handle the click and preventDefault() on pagebeforechange while opening the panel from there.
[12:28:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: That way you're going through the global click and vclick handlers.
[12:28:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I told you that during the week.
[12:28:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I had to convert popup as well as custom select to that method.
[12:28:50] <jlembeck> yeah, I've been using preventDefault on pagebeforechange, but had to stopProp as well because it was changing the hash on the page
[12:28:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: You get an additional bonus on Android in that you won't have any spurious mouseup/focusin events.
[12:28:57] <toddmparker__> right, i remember you saying that. makes sense. so we can piggyback on the standard button active state behavior and cleanup
[12:28:59] <jlembeck> which I'd assume we don't want to do since panel is not set into nav
[12:29:25] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Aaaa, right.
[12:29:26] <toddmparker__> that is a difference here - no history
[12:29:45] <toddmparker__> i'd look at collapsibles
[12:29:55] <uGoMobi> is there a panel open event?
[12:30:03] <toddmparker__> those get an active state w/touch events, then bounce back to the normal state
[12:30:04] <uGoMobi> if the menu button has a class anyway
[12:30:05] <jlembeck> Yes.
[12:30:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Actually, popups use a setTimeout to turn off the active state.
[12:30:21] <uGoMobi> we could use the event + class to remove active state
[12:30:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Because, like sliding panels, they do not cause the current page to become hidden.
[12:30:45] <toddmparker__> right, once it opens, you pull off the active state
[12:30:52] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: Seems reasonable.
[12:30:52] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:31:07] <toddmparker__> seems like a solid way to go
[12:31:18] <uGoMobi> BTW - is it easy to add a menu icon (3 horizontal stripes) to our icon sprite?
[12:31:28] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: You need to set a timeout of 300ms and remove the $.mobile.btnActiveClass ...
[12:31:34] <uGoMobi> or more something if we look into icons in general?
[12:31:47] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: js/widgets/popup.js:852
[12:31:49] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: that's a good idea
[12:31:55] <toddmparker__> we should add that icon
[12:32:03] <uGoMobi> think people would like it
[12:32:09] <toddmparker__> pretty easy - just need to add it to 4 sprites and add the styles
[12:32:11] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Maybe we should expose that code, at least internally, because you'll also have to work around being launched from a list item.
[12:32:31] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Just as popup's active-remover had to.
[12:32:59] <toddmparker__> in 1.4, we may want to switch to svg icons w/png fallbacks but we can add to the sprites for now
[12:33:17] <uGoMobi> yes we want to look into icon sizes as well
[12:33:30] <toddmparker__> right. with svg, that will be easy
[12:33:36] <uGoMobi> but nice to add this one already
[12:33:41] <toddmparker__> though the png fallbacks, less so
[12:33:44] <toddmparker__> yeah
[12:34:00] <toddmparker__> while i'm in there, any other icons we are critically missing?
[12:34:50] <toddmparker__> assigned myself an issue - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5340
[12:34:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: well, svg makes it easy to resize the icon, but you still have to deal with button padding
[12:35:01] <toddmparker__> yeah
[12:35:08] <uGoMobi> but that's for later
[12:37:32] <agcolom> my turn?
[12:37:41] <toddmparker__> sure agcolom
[12:37:47] <agcolom> Api docs:
[12:37:48] <agcolom> Modilfied the following widgets for the new version of grunt (generated examples for options, methods and events)
[12:37:48] <agcolom> •	Slider, Dialog, Collapsible, Select, Textinput, Popup, Listview, Collapsibleset
[12:37:48] <agcolom> Created the following event entries:
[12:37:48] <agcolom> •	Updatelayout, Pageremove, Swipe, Swipeleft, Swiperight
[12:37:48] <agcolom> Other changes:
[12:37:48] <agcolom> •	Designed a warning style to draw the user’s attention to a warning paragraph
[12:37:49] <agcolom> •	Created the getting started with jQuery Mobile guide on the learn site (most of the guide is based on the original guide which is on the current docs.)
[12:38:14] <toddmparker__> awesome
[12:38:20] <agcolom> the learn site will be released very soon (possibly tomorrow), then we can tweet.
[12:38:32] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:38:36] <agcolom> working on the api style guide (our widget description is long so the quick-nav section is not in view... which I believe is a problem for us...)
[12:38:39] <toddmparker__> great, that will be a good place to put longer format tutorials
[12:38:51] <toddmparker__> yes, that's a problem
[12:39:27] <toddmparker__> do you still have to update a lot of widgets to the new version of grunt?
[12:39:44] <agcolom> no, not many
[12:40:14] <agcolom> I need to cleanup button... (button vs buttonMarkup in the examples)
[12:40:23] <toddmparker__> great
[12:40:33] <agcolom> but the new version of grunt should allow me to do that easily
[12:40:42] <toddmparker__> maybe you can look at pulling tables in at some point
[12:41:10] <agcolom> then there's merging another 3 widgets into one (page sections)
[12:41:16] <toddmparker__> ah
[12:41:19] <agcolom> yes, definitely!
[12:41:24] <toddmparker__> cool
[12:42:00] <agcolom> so I'll come up with an example to discuss the new layout with Scott G and Karl this weekend
[12:42:06] <toddmparker__> at some point, we'll all have to look at the new demos and figure out what to do with pages in the current docs that aren't demos
[12:42:22] <agcolom> yes
[12:42:24] <toddmparker__> like the phonegap page, that kind of thing
[12:42:30] <toddmparker__> need an inventory
[12:42:42] <uGoMobi> was thinking the same
[12:42:48] <agcolom> yes, that's exactly what we need!
[12:42:59] <uGoMobi> like to discuss with you what should go where
[12:43:00] <toddmparker__> once we get all the api stuff in good shape, we could soft launch that and start linking to pages from our demos
[12:43:19] <toddmparker__> just need it to have parity with what we have now
[12:43:24] <toddmparker__> and it's close
[12:44:54] <toddmparker__> scott - interesting article
[12:45:11] <toddmparker__> worth adding to our preso as "the way"?
[12:45:25] <toddmparker__> i want to start collecting best practices for things like this for the deck
[12:45:39] <toddmparker__> wrong window - sorry!
[12:45:42] <toddmparker__> ha
[12:46:05] <agcolom> then that's it from me. I'm in my busiest time at work so hard to go faster ;-)
[12:46:22] <toddmparker__> no, you're cranking. thanks agcolom
[12:46:31] <agcolom> (at the moment!) will be better after Xmas I think ;-)
[12:46:43] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[12:46:47] <toddmparker__> alright, that was a long meeting but we had a lot to cover. nice to have everyone together to see what everyone is working on
[12:47:00] <_|Nix|_> Sorry, one more thing: Can we through https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2383 in there? It's basically about removing the don't-bubble from checkboxradio's vclick handler. The stop is in there for historical reasons (see issue). Can we remove that, and leave that during beta? If there are no issues, it could stay.
[12:47:08] <_|Nix|_> ... yes, I pasted that :)
[12:47:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker__: didnt have a meeting last week stuff piles up!
[12:47:24] <toddmparker__> ah, maybe that's it
[12:47:50] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: seems reasonable, let's discuss that over in -dev
[12:47:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: OK.
[12:47:55] <toddmparker__> alright, if there aren't any questions from the community, we can wrap
[12:48:13] <toddmparker__> thanks everyone, incredible work!
[12:48:21] <toddmparker__> over and out
[12:48:31] <_|Nix|_> To the batcave!
[12:48:44] <uGoMobi> later
[12:49:37] <agcolom> later all. We need to close the channel...
[12:50:03] <agcolom> ajpiano: scott_gonzalez ^ please :-)
