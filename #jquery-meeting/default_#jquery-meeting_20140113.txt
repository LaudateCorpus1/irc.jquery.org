[08:51:54] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:00:35] <DaveMethvin> what up everybody?
[09:01:45] <DaveMethvin> let's see, gibson042 _markelog m_gol rwaldron timmywil ... you guys here?
[09:02:04] <DaveMethvin> did i miss anyone who's here?
[09:02:15] <DaveMethvin> oh gnarf
[09:04:12] <DaveMethvin> hello! anybody home?
[09:04:49] <gibson042> ah, that's better
[09:04:50] <DaveMethvin> maybe that will help!
[09:04:54] <_markelog> hey
[09:05:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah i forgot i was an op so i thought the channel was already open
[09:05:09] <DaveMethvin> duh
[09:05:19] <rwaldron> [12:01:53]  <rwaldron>	 here
[09:05:20] <rwaldron> ;)
[09:05:57] <DaveMethvin> hah
[09:06:06] <DaveMethvin> hokay
[09:06:18] <DaveMethvin> i've got a real mess here
[09:06:20] <m_gol> present
[09:06:46] <DaveMethvin> when i went to land that little patch for effects i realized i'd never landed the fake timers in 1.x
[09:06:48] <DaveMethvin> so i did that
[09:06:58] <DaveMethvin> but of course there are oldIE issues
[09:07:20] <DaveMethvin> and then i went to try a push of the rc using jquery-release
[09:07:24] <DaveMethvin> and there are issues with Windows
[09:07:39] <DaveMethvin> but i also need to get a bunch of blog posts out this week
[09:07:52] <DaveMethvin> so i was hoping i could enlist some of you to look at these things
[09:07:55] <m_gol> I've seen that chat... is it really a problem with string delimiters?
[09:08:10] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure, i put together a simple test case and it seemed to work
[09:08:22] <DaveMethvin> with single quotes
[09:08:30] <DaveMethvin> but i haven't had time to look in detail
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> that code is pretty ugly tbh, it POLLS to wait for the command to finish and is incredibly cpu intensive
[09:09:13] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[09:09:16] <jaubourg> sorry I'm late
[09:09:19] <jaubourg> hi all
[09:09:31] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you're talking about oldIE handling by Sinon?
[09:09:37] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: yes
[09:09:45] <_markelog> in IE7 only?
[09:09:52] <DaveMethvin> and there's a special file we can add, but when i'm trying that locally it doesn't seem to help
[09:09:54] <DaveMethvin> no all oldIE
[09:10:25] <m_gol> _markelog: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2328
[09:10:31] <DaveMethvin> http://sinonjs.org/releases/sinon-ie-1.7.1.js
[09:10:52] <_markelog> swarm page does open for me :-(
[09:11:04] <_markelog> i guess i have bad connect
[09:11:15] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: and this file is included as-is?
[09:12:12] <DaveMethvin> well i want someone else to give it a look, i may have done something wrong
[09:12:52] <m_gol> I can try on a local IE8
[09:13:21] <DaveMethvin> http://sinonjs.org/docs/#clock
[09:13:40] <DaveMethvin> sorry, i gave the wrong link, it's http://sinonjs.org/releases/sinon-timers-ie-1.7.3.js
[09:14:27] <DaveMethvin> problem is, i have several meetings this afternoon
[09:14:35] <DaveMethvin> so i wouldn't have time to look
[09:14:54] <DaveMethvin> i was trying on Friday but kept getting interrupted and my browserstack session would time out :(
[09:15:18] <m_gol> I can look into it
[09:15:34] <m_gol> though I can't guarantee I'll get to anything usable - you never know with oldIE!
[09:15:58] <DaveMethvin> Once i pulled out the references to Date.now in the setup/teardown and included the file, the only problem that seemed to be left was that timers were left active
[09:16:09] <DaveMethvin> so i am hoping it's some really simple thing
[09:16:58] <DaveMethvin> the other problem may also be simple, jquery-release just doesn't like Windows :)
[09:17:13] <m_gol> is there anything so os-specific in there?
[09:17:19] <m_gol> doesn't seem like a low-level package
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> not that I can tell
[09:17:38] <DaveMethvin> but the code in shelljs is UUUUUUGLY
[09:18:02] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs/blob/master/src/exec.js#L45
[09:18:27] <m_gol> haha, that reminds me of lodash's method compilation
[09:19:37] <DaveMethvin> however, if i can't get this to run on Windows I may want to ping one of you to run the RC release script
[09:19:51] <DaveMethvin> it's actually a very nice process compared to doing in without jquery-release
[09:19:59] <DaveMethvin> *it
[09:20:39] <DaveMethvin> alright, what other stuff needs to land btw
[09:22:05] <DaveMethvin> I'd like to land https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1482
[09:22:07] <DaveMethvin> mark
[09:22:12] <DaveMethvin> _markelog:
[09:22:17] <DaveMethvin> is that ok with you?
[09:22:39] <_markelog> yeah it seems it should not present any danger
[09:23:10] <_markelog> although for 1.x-master we might wait until timers issue is resolved
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: thoughts on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14484 ? we could push it
[09:23:17] <DaveMethvin> _markelog: agreed
[09:23:51] <gibson042> I thought about #14484 enough to know how to resolve it, but don't want to block the release
[09:23:58] <DaveMethvin> _markelog: will you get to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14038 today?
[09:24:17] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: we can fix in a .1
[09:24:22] <_markelog> gibson042 didn't like a tmp fix
[09:24:44] <gibson042> at this point, I'd like to resolve them together or nearly so
[09:25:04] <_markelog> so we will gonna wait until next version?
[09:25:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's do that
[09:25:16] <DaveMethvin> there's enough going on without these
[09:25:30] <DaveMethvin> and it could be in a .1
[09:25:40] <_markelog> yep, my thoughts exactly
[09:26:09] <m_gol> what about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1471? It seems votes were against (for now at least) bc of potential editor problems
[09:27:10] <DaveMethvin> let's wait on it
[09:28:17] <m_gol> what about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1466?
[09:28:33] <timmywil> here!
[09:28:45] <_markelog> we could wait until next version
[09:29:01] <timmywil> I can look at jquery-release if there's a problem
[09:29:05] <_markelog> although it should be solid
[09:29:32] <DaveMethvin> lgtm and i'd be okay if we land it now
[09:29:39] <m_gol> _markelog: doesn't look like it could be problematic
[09:29:42] <DaveMethvin> SEEMS pretty low damage
[09:29:42] <m_gol> I'd be for landing
[09:29:50] <_markelog> okay then, i need to update comments for it
[09:29:58] <_markelog> as by m_gol request
[09:30:01] <_markelog> so i could land it
[09:30:15] <m_gol> yes, please :)
[09:30:33] <_markelog> don't worry i always remember
[09:31:07] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: cool, i may need you to run the RC but I'll look at why the quoting is broken when i get a chance later today
[09:31:44] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: cool, let me know when to run it
[09:31:46] <m_gol> _markelog: always? scary ;)
[09:31:58] <_markelog> :-)
[09:32:03] <DaveMethvin> as opposed to me, who never remembers
[09:32:26] <DaveMethvin> anything else look critical for pre-RC?
[09:33:05] <m_gol> this one's not pre-RC but I'd really want to get iOS to TestSwarm
[09:33:07] <timmywil> _markelog: side note, when I said it was ok to disregard Sizzle integration tests, I didn't mean we'll be removing any tests but that we don't need to run the Sizzle module from the jQuery suite after karma
[09:33:28] <m_gol> 2 failures on iOS7, one on iOS6 but we can work on them afterwards, I'd like to get the suite running first
[09:33:36] <DaveMethvin> once we are all green on swarm it would be good to add some new browsers/envs
[09:33:38] <timmywil> In other words, test/unit/selector.js should continue to run on built jQuery
[09:33:40] <m_gol> once we handle that, we can look into Android & later iOS 5 etc.
[09:33:47] <DaveMethvin> there is one fail on ie11 as well, cloning a textarea
[09:33:54] <DaveMethvin> i meant to create a ticket for it
[09:34:10] <timmywil> _markelog: just to clarify
[09:34:15] <_markelog> timmywil: then i understood you correctly :-)
[09:34:27] <timmywil> cool
[09:34:29] <_markelog> but i will make a PR for it first
[09:34:37] <_markelog> not just commit it
[09:34:41] <_markelog> and cc you
[09:34:43] <DaveMethvin> seems that IE11 fixed the cloning checkboxes but not cloning textarea, and we had a single feature detect for both :(
[09:34:43] <_markelog> just in case
[09:35:18] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: at least it should be simple to fix
[09:35:20] <_markelog> m_gol: soon ios will be run at least for sizzle tests :-)
[09:35:29] <m_gol> _markelog: great :)
[09:35:39] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we have a ticket for that?
[09:36:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: not yet
[09:36:04] <m_gol> we focused too much on old Android whereas we should start from iOS and later new Android and go from there
[09:36:19] <m_gol> unfortunately no other mobile browsers seem to have Selenium drivers available...
[09:36:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i agree with that, let's be sure the later stuff works first
[09:36:48] <_markelog> m_gol: wow, it will be cool
[09:36:50] <m_gol> ergo they're not on BrowserStack
[09:37:43] <DaveMethvin> any other issues?
[09:37:56] <DaveMethvin> imma have to run in a sec
[09:38:09] <DaveMethvin> but thanks for the help guys!
[09:38:34] <m_gol> "sync execution seems to mess up quotes" - that seems so absurd...
[09:38:51] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it's the sync as much as the process it goes through
[09:39:02] <DaveMethvin> maybe the backslash escaping breaks on Windows, i dunno
[09:39:23] <DaveMethvin> their examples in shellJS all seem to use double quotes for args, we used single
[09:39:46] <DaveMethvin> but i don't want to read too much into it until i get a simpler test case
[09:40:07] <m_gol> sure
[09:40:39] <DaveMethvin> it gets pretty far into the release script before it breaks, i guess it's the first use of quotes
[09:40:47] <m_gol> :)
[09:41:19] <DaveMethvin> okay, thanks guys
