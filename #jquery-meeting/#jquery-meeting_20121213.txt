[10:01:23] <gnarf> ajpiano: \o/
[10:01:31] <ajpiano> hi everyone
[10:02:17] <ajpiano> sorry for being a bit incommunicado lately
[10:02:20] <ajpiano> in a bit of a sprint at work
[10:02:57] <ajpiano> as you know i haven't yet announced learn
[10:03:06] <ajpiano> i started working on a contribute site
[10:03:13] <ajpiano> and then it got really big and i have a bit more content there
[10:03:18] <ajpiano> kind of want to push them simultaneously
[10:04:18] <ajpiano> but i've been kind of slammed
[10:04:35] <ajpiano> i think i'm gonna push the contrib stuff that i've done so y'all can look at it and flesh it out if anyone's feeling charitable
[10:04:54] <gnarf> sure - point me at some stuff, I'll do what I can
[10:05:40] <ajpiano> yah i'll do that within the hour then
[10:05:44] <ajpiano> at least so it isn't just languishing
[10:06:03] <ajpiano> cause i'm gonna be slammed for another week i think
[10:06:22] <ajpiano> rworth: are you around to give an update on the new-css stuff
[10:08:10] <ajpiano> looks like a no
[10:08:36] <ajpiano> as i understand it, it's moving along kind of slowly
[10:08:51] <ajpiano> i was talking with DaveMethvin and scott_gonzalez yesterday
[10:09:05] <ajpiano> and thinking that if we aren't ready w/ new css by the 1st of jan, we should maybe go live without it
[10:09:10] <ajpiano> it's just snarling us up way too much
[10:11:53] <ajpiano> it seems like no one else is here
[10:11:54] <ajpiano> :p
[10:11:57] * gnarf smiles
[10:12:05] * DaveMethvin smirks
[10:12:09] <gnarf> start off your meeting with some pings
[10:12:12] <gnarf> it helps ;)
[10:12:29] <ajpiano> i am just trying to push this contribute as is right now so y'all can look at it
[10:12:54] <ajpiano> heh, agcolom kswedberg :p
[10:13:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: got a question about the way the wordpress sync works
[10:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> I have an answer!
[10:13:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I really want to have the generated html index for http://code.jquery.com go through the same themeing/etc as the jquery.com site
[10:14:24] <gnarf> I guess I'm a little curious to know if we could sync a single "hidden" page to jquery.com somehow
[10:14:44] <gnarf> or if i should setup a whole "hidden" domain to generate it
[10:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, do you want the menus and stuff?
[10:17:02] <gnarf> hadn't really thought about that
[10:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> Is your plan to just redirect code.jquery.com/index.html -> jquery.com/code-index/ ?
[10:17:17] <gnarf> something like that
[10:17:33] <gnarf> although proxy it so that the CDN can deliver it
[10:17:38] <agcolom> hi, sorry only just arrived back home!
[10:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if it's proxied, wouldn't all the relative URLs break?
[10:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> Like links to stylesheets, images, etc.
[10:18:28] <gnarf> :/
[10:18:33] <gnarf> yes- they would
[10:18:36] <gnarf> grr
[10:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> We could look into making a template that has static URLs.
[10:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> We'd have to see how much duplication that would result in.
[10:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> It might be feasible.
[10:20:13] <gnarf> It might be better to do anyway because we could rewrite statics to be CDN delivered
[10:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> Using the CDN for statics is actually fairly painful to develop against.
[10:22:38] <gnarf> not if a deployment process can handle flushing the CDN
[10:22:56] <gnarf> just a thought
[10:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> That's not the painful part.
[10:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> The painful part is the devleopment.
[10:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> If everything is pointed at the CDN, you can't easily test changes to static content.
[10:24:10] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez: its mostly all in wordpress right? you could add logic that says if dev, point to local, otherwise cdn
[10:24:58] <gnarf> just a random thought
[10:25:09] <scott_gonzalez> So we'd need to wrap every reference to a static file in a function call
[10:25:36] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez: which for wordpress, should be doing anyway.
[10:25:50] <eddiemonge> to account for plugins and things
[10:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> What are we considering static?
[10:26:23] <eddiemonge> en_queue script or something like that
[10:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> Only files inside themes?
[10:26:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: for now I guess I'll just keep generating an index.html
[10:27:08] <gnarf> from a template
[10:27:23] <gnarf> but i think bringing it inside web-base-template might be worthwhile
[10:27:35] <gnarf> to keep consistent themeing
[10:27:37] <ajpiano> i tend to agree
[10:28:03] <gnarf> just gotta work around the absolute/relative urls
[10:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Anything else?
[10:32:56] <ajpiano> not much
[10:33:02] <ajpiano> i'm about to merge the contribute theme into web base template
[10:33:05] <ajpiano> and i'l ping you all when that's up on stage
[10:33:25] <ajpiano> otherwise... see you all in -content?
[11:00:54] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:01:02] <johnbender> hey!
[11:01:04] <johnbender> :)
[11:01:07] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile eating is starting up
[11:01:15] <toddmparker> roll call
[11:01:29] <johnbender> hmm
[11:01:34] <johnbender> what's being served?
[11:01:43] <johnbender> ... zing!
[11:01:59] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:02:34] <eddiemonge> "Also, the jQuery Mobile site needs an update, it still says to join #jquerymobile"
[11:02:48] <toddmparker> ah, gotta fix that eddiemonge
[11:02:50] <toddmparker> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1PHMYUqXDBFCrL1i2Ey5AqdiBC3frKMhHPh7yBcQ6A/edit#
[11:02:53] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:03:46] <JasonDScott__> Hi
[11:03:50] <toddmparker> hi all!
[11:04:39] <gseguin> hi
[11:05:08] <gseguin> bailing again today :( I updated the agenda with my tiny update
[11:05:10] <toddmparker> gangs all here
[11:05:14] <johnbender> gseguin: I just came up with a new nickname for you
[11:05:18] <johnbender> not particularly original
[11:05:22] <johnbender> gswizzle
[11:05:30] <toddmparker> oh, brother
[11:05:33] <toddmparker> :)
[11:05:40] * johnbender shrugs
[11:05:40] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:05:40] <toddmparker> first up, 1.3 update...
[11:05:43] <johnbender> I keeps it real
[11:05:43] <gseguin> swizzle ?
[11:05:55] <johnbender> the s -> swizzle
[11:05:59] <johnbender> it doesn't have to make sense
[11:05:59] <toddmparker> Panels: final re-factor work underway
[11:05:59] <toddmparker> We’ve decided to tweak the sliding panel code a bit and API to simplify internals and support the most common use cases. So instead of the link being used to configure the panel position (left, right) and display (reveal, push, overlay), these are now set on the panel and the link just points to which panel to display. Work being done in the slide-panel-refactor branch.
[11:06:11] <toddmparker> Still looking at whether the “push” mode is going to be performant enough to include in 1.3. Because it causes a reflow of the page, it’s much heavier than the other two modes.
[11:06:22] <gseguin> I'll catch you guys in the afternoon on -dev
[11:07:15] <toddmparker> ok gseguin
[11:07:32] <_|Nix|_> I'm here too, just so y'all know ...
[11:07:37] <toddmparker> jlembeck will give us an update on -dev later today on how this is all shaking out
[11:07:50] <toddmparker> Still aiming to get 1.3 beta out by the end of the year
[11:08:00] <_|Nix|_> Eye of the tiger!
[11:08:14] <toddmparker> seems like we're in decent shape for that, know panels are the last big thing
[11:09:09] <toddmparker> New API site and docs will go live when 1.3 hits final in early 2013
[11:09:23] <toddmparker> Tyler doing knowledge transfer with Xavier and Jeff on ThemeRoller admin
[11:09:49] <johnbender> nav might be the last big thing
[11:09:52] <johnbender> almost there though
[11:10:17] <johnbender> once it gets merged I've got some cleanup to do
[11:10:17] <toddmparker> stop holing us up johnbender
[11:10:17] <johnbender> but it's the last bit
[11:10:17] <toddmparker> holding
[11:10:17] <toddmparker> sheesh
[11:10:19] <johnbender> lol
[11:10:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:10:29] <johnbender> turnabout is fair play lol
[11:10:34] <toddmparker> let's see who lands in master first - panels or nav. it's a race
[11:10:46] <toddmparker> Tyler doing knowledge transfer with Xavier and Jeff on ThemeRoller admin
[11:10:50] <johnbender> muphry's law and whatnot
[11:10:56] <toddmparker> seriously
[11:11:03] * johnbender notes that it is in fact "muphry" and not "murphy"
[11:11:15] * _|Nix|_ nods
[11:11:18] <toddmparker> TR call happened an hour ago I believe
[11:11:36] <toddmparker> ha. oh, the irony
[11:11:42] <toddmparker> Coordinating with a few 3rd parties who want to try and contribute code to the project
[11:11:51] <jlembeck> yeah, Todd - TR call is done now
[11:12:01] <toddmparker> jlembeck: oh, great. how did it go?
[11:12:11] <jlembeck> lots of stuff there but a really solid walkthrough
[11:12:34] <toddmparker> (the idea is for Xavier to take point on TR, but have Jeff up to speed for backup)
[11:12:59] <toddmparker> yeah, it's a beast but Tyler did a nice job building it
[11:13:10] <jlembeck> yeah, works super well
[11:13:13] <jlembeck> lot of great functionality
[11:13:22] <toddmparker> easy to stage up locally too
[11:13:37] <toddmparker> jlembeck: while you're here, what's the latest work on panels?
[11:14:00] <johnbender> can I go next :)
[11:14:09] <jlembeck> Tack me on at the end :)
[11:14:10] <toddmparker> sure johnbender
[11:14:24] <johnbender> almost done with the sequence tests
[11:14:30] <johnbender> we're down to the last few stalls
[11:14:42] <toddmparker> woo hoo
[11:14:43] <johnbender> hoping to merge by tomorrow afternoon
[11:14:44] <johnbender> err
[11:14:48] <johnbender> push by tomorrow afternoon
[11:14:51] <johnbender> it's been merged
[11:14:55] <toddmparker> yeah? great!
[11:15:17] <johnbender> at which point I'll probably dive into cleaning up the internals a tad
[11:15:37] <johnbender> also
[11:15:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and I'm thinking about cleaning up the sequence tests too - make them faster, more reliable ...
[11:15:50] <johnbender> talked with the other dev leads yesterday
[11:15:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: they are already
[11:16:00] <johnbender> as a consequence of the refactor
[11:16:03] <johnbender> at least it looks that way
[11:16:17] <johnbender> since there's no delay/timeout for hashchange with popstate
[11:16:26] <toddmparker> that would be great
[11:16:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: True, but I know of lots of kludges: Like, "expect event 'xyzzy.suffix'" ...
[11:16:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: removed those :)
[11:16:47] <toddmparker> +1000
[11:16:54] <johnbender> they were blocking the tests :)
[11:16:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, awesome!
[11:16:58] <johnbender> did that about an hour ago
[11:17:01] <johnbender> yes
[11:17:02] <johnbender> good things
[11:17:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: scott_gonzalez is wondering about the css stuff
[11:17:40] <johnbender> we were delayed because of markup changes for the post oldIE era
[11:17:44] <johnbender> or some such
[11:17:46] <johnbender> as I recall
[11:18:28] <toddmparker> johnbender: what css stuff?
[11:18:37] <johnbender> toddmparker: the merge with UI
[11:18:50] <johnbender> we can discuss that further offline if you want
[11:18:55] <johnbender> just wanted to point it out before I forget
[11:19:12] <toddmparker> thanks, missed that. offline.
[11:19:18] <toddmparker> ok, anything else?
[11:20:05] <toddmparker> I think agcolom should go next. Mix it up.
[11:20:21] <uGoMobi> I don't think she is here
[11:20:34] <uGoMobi> see her message on -dev
[11:20:40] <toddmparker> d'oh
[11:20:47] <toddmparker> missed that. next week then
[11:21:06] <toddmparker> ok, back to jlembeck then?
[11:21:12] <toddmparker> panel bizness
[11:21:25] <jlembeck> So panels made the switch from being a dynamic panel that was created based on the link you pressed
[11:21:38] <jlembeck> and is now a set panel, with all of its attributes defined on the panel itself
[11:21:52] <jlembeck> this matches the use cases for a panel significantly better.
[11:21:59] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: So, no more link attributes?
[11:22:04] <jlembeck> nope.
[11:22:12] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Great - that should simplify things.
[11:22:15] <johnbender> frankly that makes more sense to me
[11:22:30] <jlembeck> yeah, we had a working version of the other way, but it was overly complicated for what this is
[11:22:33] <uGoMobi> nice change indeed
[11:22:34] <johnbender> we don't have the infrastructure to properly maintain links between dom elements in the project
[11:22:41] <toddmparker> yeah, exactly. seems like most people will have a panel that does a certain transition so if we bake it into the panel, it's way simpler
[11:23:01] <toddmparker> starting to wonder if we should do the same for popup based on how much this simplified panels
[11:23:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Popup has two link-based properties.
[11:23:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: positionTo, and transition.
[11:23:43] <toddmparker> right
[11:23:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: positionTo is dynamic during a single open/close anyway, because of resize.
[11:24:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We could simplify with transition a bit.
[11:24:29] <toddmparker> yeah, be good to see if there are ways to simplify popup by making some calls
[11:24:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Not sure about breaking API though.
[11:24:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We've promised to honour those link attributes.
[11:24:54] <toddmparker> definably a conversation for later
[11:25:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, we don't need to decide now.
[11:25:26] <toddmparker> that's why with panels, we wanted to make the change *now* even though ti was working great the other way. hard to take it back.
[11:25:43] <jlembeck> on the panel note, we've got reveal and overlay working pretty dang smoothly, we're trying to make push part of that smoothness
[11:25:51] * _|Nix|_ nods gravely
[11:26:18] <jlembeck> ipad sees some jank in the reflowing of content, I'm working on a solution :)
[11:26:30] <toddmparker> so jeff - push is the last thing that still needs some work?
[11:26:42] <jlembeck> yeah, in particular, the content reflow part
[11:26:43] <toddmparker> reflow is brutal on a tablet
[11:26:48] <jlembeck> yes.
[11:26:53] <toddmparker> thanks jlembeck
[11:27:20] <toddmparker> btw - I saw there is already a video tutorial on how to use panels
[11:27:27] <toddmparker> I told them it's changing
[11:27:32] <toddmparker> people pick up on stuff fast
[11:27:36] <jlembeck> wow!
[11:27:41] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:27:45] <toddmparker> ok, who wants to go next?
[11:27:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its because you tweeted it
[11:27:59] <_|Nix|_> I'll be quick ...
[11:28:09] <toddmparker> gor for it _|Nix|_
[11:28:29] <_|Nix|_> Two things: Worked with johnbender on the nav stuff, and fixed the fixedToolbar persistence.
[11:28:40] <johnbender> yes, thanks for that
[11:28:45] <johnbender> got me headed in the right direction :)
[11:28:47] <toddmparker> so happy the fixed toolbar is working again
[11:28:48] <_|Nix|_> I'd like to know more about the Samsung guys, if we have time left.
[11:29:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: I was thinking we could do a hangout about the external projects
[11:29:09] <toddmparker> glad to see you diving into the nav stuff _|Nix|_ - we need some backup for johnbender
[11:29:11] <johnbender> lots to talk about
[11:29:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, turns out that ._on( { event: function() { ._off(); } is not a replacement for .one()
[11:29:40] <toddmparker> Interesting, so that was the culprit
[11:29:41] <_|Nix|_> I'm curious too ...
[11:30:50] <_|Nix|_> +1 to the hangout, I mean.
[11:31:14] <toddmparker> I really don't have any more info than that email, hope to hear more tomorrow
[11:31:31] <toddmparker> maybe after we get some details, we should all huddle
[11:31:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: with the time difference tomorrow 9am for them is tonight at 7 pm for us
[11:31:54] <toddmparker> arschmitz: oh, really?
[11:31:58] <arschmitz> yup :)
[11:32:06] <toddmparker> Must have mis-read that
[11:32:07] <uGoMobi> yes 1am here
[11:32:16] <toddmparker> crazy timezones
[11:32:18] <uGoMobi> unix time? ;-)
[11:32:20] <arschmitz> yeah im all down on the korean time since i went there ha ha
[11:32:20] <toddmparker> ok, good to know
[11:32:36] <toddmparker> I would have missed it, thought it was 7am tomorrow
[11:32:48] <toddmparker> you're so worldly arschmitz
[11:32:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: What email?
[11:33:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: All I know about is the stuff in the channel.
[11:33:23] <arschmitz> ha ha so is that what it takes to become worldly 14 times zones?
[11:33:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I forwarded the email to you
[11:33:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where Changsuk asks for my email address?
[11:33:51] <uGoMobi> nope, after that one
[11:34:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, got it.
[11:34:31] <toddmparker> cool
[11:34:34] <toddmparker> godo topic for -dev
[11:34:50] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: seems like you're covered?
[11:34:58] <toddmparker> who wants to hop in next?
[11:35:15] <uGoMobi> ok I'll go
[11:35:15] <agcolom> I can I have just 1 update
[11:35:28] <uGoMobi> sure agcolom
[11:35:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[11:35:34] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[11:35:42] <toddmparker> hi agcolom - I offered for you to go earlier, I swear
[11:35:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll try to show up for the meeting - 02:00 for me ... *yawn*
[11:36:03] <agcolom> just had time for 1 entry this week... been mad
[11:36:08] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: nice
[11:36:22] <toddmparker> agcolom: cool that you started on tables
[11:36:25] <toddmparker> catching up
[11:36:26] <agcolom> just had a chance to do the basic table entry
[11:36:46] <agcolom> will do the other 2 in the next few days....
[11:37:05] <agcolom> At least we know how we want to present them now, so that's good :-)
[11:37:15] <agcolom> and that's it from me :-)
[11:38:06] <toddmparker> thanks agcolom, hope things slow down for you at some point
[11:38:11] <toddmparker> holidays
[11:38:28] <agcolom> yes, next week (wednesday/thursday)
[11:38:47] <agcolom> for about 2 weeks I think! but I'll have internet access :-)
[11:39:28] <toddmparker> ok, have fun!
[11:39:35] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[11:39:35] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: wanna go?
[11:39:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: respect that you joined the meeting despite the sad news you just received
[11:39:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sure
[11:40:13] <uGoMobi> Added two swipe demos:
[11:40:13] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/swipe/swipe-list.html
[11:40:13] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/swipe/swipe-page.html (problem: source code highlighting does only work for the first page + need to add prefetch next page)
[11:41:12] <toddmparker> *looking at demo*
[11:41:31] <uGoMobi> maybe arschmitz or _|Nix|_ can help me look into that highlight issue cos I don't see it
[11:41:51] <uGoMobi> demos view source: you can now target an html element of which the markup should be shown (so you can show a whole page without the need to wrap in a div)
[11:41:53] <toddmparker> updated swipe list looks great.
[11:41:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can help if you want
[11:42:11] <toddmparker> think the overlay theme maybe makes it feel too modal?
[11:42:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: maybe bit too much blue now with the swipe list
[11:42:24] <toddmparker> I like the blue overlay
[11:42:53] <uGoMobi> without overlay the blue popup on blue active list item doesn't look good
[11:42:57] <toddmparker> guess you could tack any theme swatch onto the swiped row
[11:43:08] <uGoMobi> but yeah, might need some changes
[11:43:12] <toddmparker> even just a gray button like c?
[11:43:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I see ... no HTML for the swipe-page.html ...
[11:43:20] <toddmparker> slick tho
[11:43:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the source code is correct but the highlighter doesn't do its job
[11:43:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right - I see it now.
[11:44:05] <toddmparker> swipe page is cool too
[11:44:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: other color for active list item is good idea
[11:44:45] <toddmparker> just needs something to indicate the row, can be more subtle
[11:45:00] <uGoMobi> while working on demos you run into issues too so takes more time than i thought
[11:45:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I agree
[11:45:10] <toddmparker> heh, yeah
[11:45:15] <toddmparker> that's why they are good.
[11:45:22] <uGoMobi> true
[11:45:25] <toddmparker> nice photos on the page demo
[11:45:27] <uGoMobi> example: noticed issues with the CSS transitions and transform 3D tests
[11:45:44] <uGoMobi> thanks, unfortunately i didn't take them myself ;)
[11:46:10] <toddmparker> did the list view filter go away on the demo page for a reason?
[11:46:32] <uGoMobi> sorry what do you mean?
[11:47:25] <uGoMobi> ah on the demo index page?
[11:48:08] <uGoMobi> right, yeah I removed that at some point just to keep markup as basic as possible until we have design for new docs
[11:48:51] <toddmparker> yep
[11:48:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the top says 1.2.0 final on top of index page too
[11:49:00] <toddmparker> yeah...
[11:49:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah that's same as docs homepage
[11:49:12] <toddmparker> it's no biggie, just curious
[11:49:37] <uGoMobi> we use a function that grabs the version from version.txt
[11:49:48] <toddmparker> ah
[11:50:10] <arschmitz> i thought it used to say latest though?
[11:50:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that demo index page is only temporary, right?
[11:50:13] <toddmparker> ok, so you're on demo duty for the most part uGoMobi
[11:50:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: for sure
[11:50:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: depends on local or on server
[11:50:36] <toddmparker> once panels are are, i want to start looking at a new demo design
[11:50:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes demo duty
[11:50:43] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:50:45] <toddmparker> ok, great
[11:50:49] <toddmparker> arschmitz: how goes?
[11:50:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok that must be it
[11:50:51] <uGoMobi> some triage and reviewed PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4973 (closed, have to look into other CSS to give the title in the header more space)
[11:50:58] <uGoMobi> oh sorry
[11:51:14] <uGoMobi> updated contributing guidelines and JS Bin test case template
[11:51:21] <uGoMobi> that was it
[11:51:30] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:51:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz... go ahead
[11:52:06] <arschmitz> Mostly working on ironing out the rangeslider
[11:52:30] <toddmparker> ah, was wondering about that PR
[11:52:34] <arschmitz> have one last feature im trying to get working which is dragging the whole range when you drag the highlight
[11:52:41] <toddmparker> (sorry uGoMobi, thought you were done)
[11:52:46] <uGoMobi> np
[11:53:02] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that drag fill thing isn't critical by any stretch
[11:53:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i have it mostly working already just 2 bugs i need to figure out on it
[11:53:26] <toddmparker> go ahead and button this up and we can always add that as an enhancement once in master
[11:53:33] <toddmparker> oh, great
[11:53:53] <uGoMobi> then I will finish slider full width CSS and add the demos
[11:54:13] <arschmitz> also made a super quick extension to quite the guy on the issue that wanted a push option
[11:54:31] <uGoMobi> what issue?
[11:55:06] <toddmparker> arschmitz ^
[11:55:19] <arschmitz> finding it

[11:55:58] <_|Nix|_> Or not ...
[11:56:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes but it's an old one
[11:56:08] * _|Nix|_ needs to learn to use GMail ...
[11:56:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, didn't know it was about range slider
[11:57:35] <_|Nix|_> If I may butt in: Another thing ... who's going to which conference - if any?
[11:57:49] <arschmitz> also addressed scott_gonzalez concerns about which handle is selected when clicking on track
[11:58:27] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: nothing planned for me
[11:59:47] <uGoMobi> same here
[11:59:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^^
[11:59:56] <arschmitz> me either
[12:00:10] <toddmparker> arschmitz: keep plugging away, you're super close on slider
[12:00:11] <toddmparker> who else is here that didn't yet go?
[12:00:11] <toddmparker> JasonDScott__?
[12:00:34] <JasonDScott__> No real updates for me
[12:00:42] <uGoMobi> hi JasonDScott__
[12:00:51] <JasonDScott__> hi uGoMobi
[12:02:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Keith isn't here I think, I will see if he is on -dev tomorrow and ask about grid listview demo
[12:02:16] <toddmparker> ok, great uGoMobi
[12:02:27] <uGoMobi> so we keep things going
[12:02:29] <toddmparker> great, we made it on time
[12:03:04] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:03:13] <arschmitz> is that good or does it mean we are all slacking off ? lol
[12:03:20] <toddmparker> SLACKERS
[12:03:22] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=19&state=open
[12:03:24] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:03:29] <toddmparker> ^^ any issues we can close there?
[12:03:37] <toddmparker> somehow, we went up to 11
[12:03:52] <uGoMobi> I added that blocker issue
[12:03:54] <toddmparker> arschmitz: is working on 2 of those
[12:04:00] <toddmparker> we're on panels
[12:04:11] <toddmparker> 5 are demos?
[12:04:19] <arschmitz> i am lol?
[12:04:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: created that autocomplete demo but didn't landed yet
[12:04:25] <toddmparker> wonder if we should consolidate
[12:04:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We need to check the nav deps after we merge.
[12:04:33] <toddmparker> range slider + full width
[12:04:39] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yep
[12:04:39] <arschmitz> oh ok
[12:05:07] <arschmitz> full width is more uGoMobi :)
[12:05:18] <toddmparker> wilt will close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5359
[12:05:20] <toddmparker> that's fixed
[12:05:24] <arschmitz> but thats waiting on me so i suppose :)
[12:05:41] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045 is more about changes in structure CSS
[12:05:48] <toddmparker> so we're in good shape for 1.3
[12:06:00] <gseguin> I'll create a PR so you guys can review it
[12:06:02] <toddmparker> we're all close to landing the last items
[12:06:11] <toddmparker> the 2 base tag items, not so sure
[12:06:29] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4389 has milestone 1.3 but we could remove that
[12:06:42] <uGoMobi> because we won't land everything in that thread for 1.3
[12:06:53] <uGoMobi> so the ticket will remain open anyway
[12:07:10] <uGoMobi> or maybe create a wiki page
[12:07:17] <toddmparker> it's ok to leave that open and tagged
[12:07:18] <uGoMobi> to list demos we want
[12:07:23] <uGoMobi> on going thing
[12:07:29] <toddmparker> but there are 4 other 1.3 issues that are docs
[12:07:33] <uGoMobi> then we can close the ticket
[12:07:36] <toddmparker> so we could close those and add to that
[12:07:43] <toddmparker> yeah, true
[12:07:56] <toddmparker> i'm fine with closing demo issues
[12:08:10] <uGoMobi> ok I will take care of that
[12:08:21] <toddmparker> gseguin finished this, right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5096
[12:08:34] <uGoMobi> 21:05 <gseguin> I'll create a PR so you guys can review it
[12:08:54] <uGoMobi> we can close by merging that PR
[12:09:04] <gseguin> sounds good
[12:09:11] <toddmparker> ah, ok. I saw the demo so I though it was in master
[12:09:18] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: thanks
[12:09:33] <gseguin> The demo might need some CSS love like a spinner or something like that
[12:09:35] <toddmparker> if you can help clean up the demo issues in the tracker, it'll feel like we're closer :)
[12:09:43] <uGoMobi> :D
[12:09:47] <uGoMobi> sure np
[12:10:00] <toddmparker> gseguin: we have our loader, we could drop that in
