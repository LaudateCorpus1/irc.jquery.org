[14:01:26] <arschmitz> apsdehal: agcolom: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: cgack: sfrisk: Meeting time
[14:01:37] <cgack> howdy all!
[14:01:43] <apsdehal> Hi
[14:01:52] <jasperdegroot> hola
[14:03:27] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:04:17] <arschmitz> the dev summit was successful
[14:04:36] <arschmitz> we helped a lot of people get their first contributions
[14:04:37] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[14:04:45] <arschmitz> and even got some of our own work done too!
[14:04:46] <gabrielschulhof> Super-cool!
[14:05:07] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: and i looked at the bootstrap testing pr
[14:05:18] <gabrielschulhof> ... which is all squashed 'n all, BTW.
[14:05:29] <arschmitz> execlent
[14:05:36] <gabrielschulhof> Just waitin' on grunt-qunit-istanbul ...
[14:05:56] <arschmitz> that should be know problem just waiting for jzaefferer to get home and ill ask him to give the thumbs up
[14:06:02] <sfrisk> allo
[14:06:14] <arschmitz> probably wont really be until tomorrow thoug
[14:06:26] <gabrielschulhof> NP.
[14:06:42] <arschmitz> the accordion PR got landed
[14:06:48] <sfrisk> huzzuh!
[14:06:59] <arschmitz> the collapsible update pr got landed
[14:07:46] <cgack> navbar is ready for another (hopefully final) round of review
[14:07:47] <arschmitz> also on the testing front we are working on dropping phantom JS for commandline testing
[14:08:19] <arschmitz> im doing this for UI right now we will run headless in a virtual box via selenium and webdriver on actual chrome
[14:08:28] <arschmitz> i have it working but need to do some cleanup
[14:08:31] <apsdehal> Yay
[14:08:56] <arschmitz> this is just a stopgap until we can use intern
[14:08:57] <gabrielschulhof> But, like, that won't work on travis, right? You were saying it's just for local.
[14:09:05] <arschmitz> but it gets rid of old phantom at least
[14:09:11] <gabrielschulhof> OK, right. Stopgap. Gotcha.
[14:09:15] <arschmitz> travis will use browserstack
[14:09:38] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: So, are we gonna have a whole boatload of jobs, each for a browser?
[14:09:42] <arschmitz> browserstack has selenium server endpoint
[14:09:45] <arschmitz> no
[14:09:50] <arschmitz> it will just test chrome same as local
[14:10:13] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:10:20] <jasperdegroot> do people need to install or setup something before they can run tests?
[14:10:28] <arschmitz> npm install
[14:10:34] <arschmitz> but thats already the case
[14:10:35] <jasperdegroot> ok so that's just the same
[14:10:41] <gabrielschulhof> What about VirtualBox?
[14:10:43] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:10:51] <arschmitz> optional
[14:10:52] <gabrielschulhof> Is there an npm for that? If so, wow!
[14:11:03] <arschmitz> you can just point at your normal chrome
[14:11:14] <arschmitz> you dont need to use virtaul box that just will make it headless
[14:11:32] <arschmitz> and you can always just open the page in your browser like you always have too
[14:12:13] <gabrielschulhof> Sounds good!
[14:12:41] <arschmitz> we could think about on BS doing like latest ie and FF too but even just chrome is better then right now
[14:13:09] <agcolom> Sorry I'm late... don't forget to write in the notes https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=295611051
[14:15:21] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: how are demos looking?
[14:16:14] <jasperdegroot> Inow those accordion and collapsible PRs landed I should be able to fix most of the things
[14:16:24] <arschmitz> execlent
[14:16:27] <jasperdegroot> but didn't had time yet since back from the summit
[14:16:36] <arschmitz> understandable
[14:17:01] <jasperdegroot> I'll try to have a PR ready before next week's meeting
[14:17:06] <arschmitz> minor but there is a problem with filterable amd wrapper i noticed
[14:17:12] <arschmitz> filed an issue its missing dependencies
[14:17:19] <arschmitz> i noticed another one after the ticket too
[14:17:20] <jasperdegroot> which should cover most of the remaining issues that are listed in the ticket
[14:17:27] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: perfect
[14:19:13] <jasperdegroot> did anyone had a chance to look at those iOS9 issues?
[14:19:26] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i looked at them a bit
[14:19:42] <jasperdegroot> is it something we should fix, you think?
[14:19:46] <jasperdegroot> or iOS bug?
[14:19:47] <arschmitz> this is not a "jquery mobile" problem from what i can see but one we will need to figure out none the less
[14:20:05] <arschmitz> its a change in the webviews on ios9
[14:20:18] <arschmitz> there seem to be 2 solutions i have seen so far
[14:20:24] <arschmitz> dont use hash listening
[14:20:36] <arschmitz> or use the old type webview
[14:21:04] <arschmitz> so the easiest wipe our hands of it solution is just say "use wkebview"
[14:21:28] <arschmitz> i think there may already be an issue open that would fix this though
[14:21:34] <arschmitz> in a better way
[14:21:43] <arschmitz> so iOS should not actually use hash change
[14:21:52] <arschmitz> no platform that supports history api should
[14:21:55] <arschmitz> but currently all do
[14:22:07] <arschmitz> they always do both because of a very very very old iOS 4 bug
[14:22:08] <jasperdegroot> I see
[14:22:15] <arschmitz> we have not supported iOS 4 in years
[14:22:43] <arschmitz> so if we just fix this like we said we were going to when we released 1.3 it might fix the issue
[14:23:28] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thoughts?
[14:24:24] <gabrielschulhof> Jussec ... had to step away for a sec ...
[14:24:30] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, about the hashchange?
[14:24:37] <arschmitz> yes
[14:25:01] <gabrielschulhof> Ummm ... yeah ... if we have no more browsers that need hashchange, then hack 'n slash.
[14:25:14] <arschmitz> we cant do that
[14:25:24] <arschmitz> we do have browsers thats not what i suuggested
[14:25:39] <arschmitz> i suggested completely seperating push and hash
[14:25:50] <arschmitz> right now we do a hash change then squash it with replace state
[14:25:51] <gabrielschulhof> OPh, right.
[14:25:58] <gabrielschulhof> Right, yeah.
[14:26:02] <arschmitz> we should just replace that with a push state
[14:26:03] <gabrielschulhof> It should be a clean separation.
[14:26:13] <arschmitz> this was there to fix an ios 4 bug
[14:26:24] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, like, either pushState() (and not replaceState()), or hashchange.
[14:26:43] <gabrielschulhof> ... but, as we all things nav, it's a tricky proposition.
[14:27:04] <arschmitz> well this also makes it possible to use replace state to support other cases
[14:27:32] <arschmitz> like allowing pushing of new entries and history less nav and all the other things we need
[14:27:33] <gabrielschulhof> Like, maybe, non-deep-linkable?
[14:27:37] <arschmitz> yes
[14:27:44] <arschmitz> it is needed for that explicitly
[14:27:46] <gabrielschulhof> Oooh, aaaaw ... all in favour.
[14:28:13] <gabrielschulhof> But d000d ... that is a deep dive ...
[14:28:35] <gabrielschulhof> TBH, I'm not sure I'll have the time to do this in one contiguous chunk ... *sigh*
[14:28:56] <gabrielschulhof> This borders on a nav rewrite ...
[14:29:16] <gabrielschulhof> ... because I know that in nav it's all too easy for one thing to lead to another ..
[14:29:54] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i didnt ask you to do it and this is actually a very small change in how navigation works
[14:30:19] <gabrielschulhof> No, I know, I'm just trying to size up the task - pessimistically.
[14:30:20] <arschmitz> iv already done it once we did it in a branch at the end of 1.3 but decided ot wait for 1.4 and then it never got it
[14:30:25] <arschmitz> in
[14:30:38] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK. Well, that sounds good :)
[14:30:49] <jasperdegroot> yeah I remember that
[14:31:07] <jasperdegroot> was looking for the related ticket but can't find it
[14:31:24] <arschmitz> yeah it may have been closed for some reason at some point
[14:31:32] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:31:38] <gabrielschulhof> So, we wanna put this on the plate for 1.5?
[14:31:42] <arschmitz> but we did it aleady once so it should not be a big deal to do again if it fixes the issue
[14:31:53] <gabrielschulhof> ... what with the new iOS WebView phenomenon?
[14:31:57] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: first we need to confirm it works
[14:31:59] <arschmitz> yes
[14:32:42] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hope you still have the fork that has the branch in it :)
[14:32:49] <jasperdegroot> can you reproduce the issue by adding to homescreen and then open the web page?
[14:32:51] <arschmitz> lol who knows ill look
[14:32:53] <jasperdegroot> or didnt' try?
[14:33:08] <arschmitz> i have not tried yet i was only reasearching the issue briefly
[14:33:16] <arschmitz> and it seemed related to hashchange
[14:33:27] <arschmitz> specificly window.history.hash
[14:33:30] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:33:41] <arschmitz> and so if we dont use that by useing push state im hoping it will fix it
[14:34:03] <arschmitz> i mean window.location..hash
[14:34:13] <gabrielschulhof> So, lemme guess: IE9 is the only remaining platform to not have pushState ...
[14:34:22] <arschmitz> yes
[14:34:27] <arschmitz> well kinda
[14:34:37] <arschmitz> we disable it selectively some places we need to retest
[14:34:41] <arschmitz> liek crios
[14:34:54] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK.
[14:35:08] <arschmitz> im hoping its fixed there
[14:38:43] <arschmitz> ok i think thats all i have this week
[14:38:48] <arschmitz> des any one else have anything?
[14:39:05] <sfrisk> not me
