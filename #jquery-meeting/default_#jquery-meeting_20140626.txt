[11:02:39] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz gschulhof gseguin|away agcolom cgack
[11:03:11] <arschmitz> hello
[11:03:14] <agcolom> hello
[11:03:17] <jasperdegroot> hey
[11:03:17] <cgack> Howdy
[11:03:18] <jperrault> hello
[11:03:30] <arschmitz> jperrault: welcome
[11:04:38] <jasperdegroot> let's start with 1.4.3 status
[11:04:50] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you got green tests, right?
[11:05:11] <arschmitz> yup
[11:05:24] <jasperdegroot> turned out there were lots of issues with demos
[11:05:25] <arschmitz> waiting for a second run of ALL of the tests
[11:05:37] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:05:38] <arschmitz> should be done in ~5 - 10 minutes
[11:05:59] <cgack> Then deploy?
[11:06:05] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: we still have this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7518
[11:06:24] <arschmitz> cgack: not quite but close
[11:06:38] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: is that PR ready for a final review?
[11:07:01] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i need to double check but i think so
[11:07:07] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:07:22] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: can you assign it to gschulhof after you checked?
[11:07:22] <arschmitz> my mind is still spining from staring at demos tests for a week straight
[11:07:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup
[11:07:33] <jasperdegroot> lol
[11:07:37] <jasperdegroot> I can imagine
[11:07:53] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: it crawls 1820 links every run
[11:08:08] <arschmitz> and each loads an average of 20 resources
[11:08:19] <arschmitz> and iv run them hundreds and hundreds of times
[11:08:20] <jasperdegroot> :P
[11:08:53] <arschmitz> but the demos site should be in really good shape now
[11:08:55] <jasperdegroot> there is one PR in ThemeRoller repo that is ready for review https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/pull/203
[11:08:56] <arschmitz> and a lot faster
[11:09:07] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: awesome!
[11:09:07] <arschmitz> ok ill look after meeting
[11:09:18] <jasperdegroot> ok thanks
[11:09:51] <jasperdegroot> and we probably need to update the changelog for 1.4.3 a bit
[11:10:09] <jasperdegroot> add the last commits
[11:10:38] <arschmitz> yeah just a new new entry for the demos tests i think most of the other stuff is fixing things we broke sicne 1.4.2 so no need to add change log entries
[11:10:56] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:11:20] <jasperdegroot> I can add those
[11:11:28] <arschmitz> ok
[11:11:52] <jasperdegroot> so it looks like it will be beginning next week that we can release
[11:11:58] <arschmitz> im going to do a pr for the demos after meeting
[11:12:04] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup shoot for monday
[11:12:09] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you're on vacation as from Thursday?
[11:12:16] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes
[11:12:21] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:12:27] <arschmitz> ill be available via email
[11:12:28] <jasperdegroot> Monday sounds good
[11:12:51] <arschmitz> and i can get online if i need but no wifi so ill be thethering
[11:13:15] <arschmitz> or if something REALLY horrible happens i can go in town to a coffee shop
[11:13:30] <jasperdegroot> shoud be fine
[11:13:34] <arschmitz> but lets assume that wont happen lol
[11:14:19] <jasperdegroot> do we have anything about 1.5 development?
[11:14:35] <arschmitz> i have only worked on tests
[11:14:39] <jasperdegroot> anything to discuss*
[11:14:44] <jasperdegroot> yeah, of course
[11:15:13] <jasperdegroot> web-ui-fw team is going to do PRs for deprecating style option of the textinput widget
[11:15:18] <arschmitz> i believe i saw that the guys from samsung prefer not to work on accordion
[11:15:32] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, they replied by mail
[11:16:05] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: which is fine there is not a lot of work there either i or gabriel or cgack or all three lol can work on that
[11:16:57] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:17:15] <arschmitz> we also have joebot0101 who is doing some triage right now and is looking to help out more with dev as he gets more familiar
[11:17:21] <jasperdegroot> it would be good if we review our roadmap
[11:17:40] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah we need to do a few updates and juggle some things around
[11:17:52] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: also you saw about ui textinput
[11:17:54] <jasperdegroot> and when we decided when to adopt which widget from UI we can make a planning for style options deprecation
[11:18:10] <arschmitz> thats going to be part of button or right after
[11:18:34] <jasperdegroot> yes
[11:18:36] <arschmitz> im making a textinput widget for ui based on our
[11:18:57] <jasperdegroot> so there is something with every widget
[11:18:58] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats next step after controlgroup
[11:19:05] <jasperdegroot> ok cool
[11:19:54] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but we dont need to worry about that yet none of that will be done before 1.5
[11:20:15] <arschmitz> we will likely adapt those all in 1.6 it looks like
[11:21:10] <jasperdegroot> but then it has not much use to deprecate the style option in 1.5
[11:21:24] <jasperdegroot> if we switch to new widget in 1.6 anyway
[11:21:29] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sure there is we will have to have backcompat
[11:21:45] <arschmitz> and we dont wat to backcompt style options into the new widgets
[11:21:56] <arschmitz> the api changes will be a pain enough
[11:23:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: also something like style options should be done all at once
[11:23:47] <arschmitz> otherwise its confusing why some widgets are one way and some another like with enhanced right now
[11:23:56] <jasperdegroot> sorry, I am tethering and was dc for a moment
[11:24:02] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yes, agreed
[11:24:15] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no problem im sure ill feel your pain next week
[11:24:27] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i should still be around for meetings most likely
[11:24:36] <jasperdegroot> tethering is still better than the wifi in this hotel
[11:24:45] <jasperdegroot> I am in Madrid for a conference
[11:24:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: lol
[11:24:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: cool
[11:25:06] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz:  so in 1.6 the old and new widget will live next to eachother
[11:25:16] <jasperdegroot> and only the old widget will have the backcompat
[11:25:17] <jasperdegroot> ?
[11:25:32] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: im just hoping i actually have good service im on a mountain on an island off the coast lol
[11:25:35] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no
[11:25:47] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: only new widget
[11:25:58] <arschmitz> but with an extension to backcompat the api
[11:26:07] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[11:26:17] <jasperdegroot> gotcha
[11:26:24] <arschmitz> it will be a real pain lol but because they have the same name there is no real choice
[11:26:39] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:27:09] <arschmitz> part of why it was important to get rid of dialog
[11:27:19] <arschmitz> now we dont have to deal with that when we adopt ui dialog
[11:27:32] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:27:52] <arschmitz> that would have been horrible some how making popup dialog and ui dialog api compatible ?!?!?
[11:28:10] <jasperdegroot> yeah lol
[11:29:04] <jasperdegroot> ok, so we will give the planning another look
[11:29:33] <jasperdegroot> agcolom cgack do you have anything to discuss
[11:29:34] <jasperdegroot> ?
[11:29:55] <cgack> sadly no - busy with the day job all week
[11:30:18] <jasperdegroot> cgack: no problem, I understand
[11:31:13] <arschmitz> cgack: yeah no worries
[11:31:35] <agcolom> no, nothing
[11:31:56] <jasperdegroot> ok, then I think we can wrap up here
[11:31:58] <agcolom> I did review a PR by Gabriel yesterday or the day before
[11:32:16] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: cool, thanks
[11:32:31] <agcolom> just 2 typos. not checked whether he's had a chance to make the changes
[11:32:44] <arschmitz> agcolom: saw those thank you
[11:32:49] <agcolom> :-)
[11:33:07] <jasperdegroot> BTW - besides my IRC nick I also changed my GitHub username... @jaspermdegroot
[11:33:19] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: cool good to know
[11:33:31] <agcolom> you can ping me when you think the changelog and other docs need reviewing as well
[11:34:13] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: agcolom: just to let you both know if you see issue comments from joebot0101 he is trying to help with triage so if we can try to follow up on those it would help him out
[11:34:15] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: the changelog is already in a branch so it can be reviewed
[11:34:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: agcolom: i will try also of course but might be slow while im gone
[11:34:33] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok awesome
[11:34:42] <agcolom> sure, yes, and great!
[11:35:07] <arschmitz> thank you
[11:35:09] <arschmitz> !
[11:35:14] <agcolom> btw, I'm havign a detailed read (and reviewing with typos fixes ;-) ) of http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html
[11:35:24] <agcolom> really worth having a look.
[11:35:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: cool good to know
[11:35:54] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: nice, thanks, will take a look
[11:36:13] <arschmitz> im looking at a new bot from twitter too that _zoggy_ suggested
[11:36:21] <arschmitz> it triages github issues
[11:36:33] <arschmitz> and verifies that jsbins have valid markup
[11:36:48] <agcolom> nice!
[11:36:58] <arschmitz> seems like it could be cool
[11:37:21] <jasperdegroot> and if it doesn't find a link to a JS Bin in the ticket it will auto-close? ;-)
[11:37:42] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: that would be sweet not sure
[11:37:51] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but its open source so i bet we could make it lol
[11:37:59] <jasperdegroot> cool
[11:38:18] <jasperdegroot> ok, thanks all!
[11:38:28] <jasperdegroot> see you on -dev
