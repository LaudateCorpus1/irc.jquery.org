[09:01:20] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gnarf jaubourg rwaldron mikesherov meetin time!
[09:01:29] <timmywil> ahhhh
[09:01:40] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 said he wouldn
[09:01:44] <DaveMethvin> t make it today
[09:02:02] <mikesherov> JQUERY CORE TEAM ASSEMBLE
[09:02:06] <gnarf> here but semi-afk working on something for ajpiano
[09:02:22] <DaveMethvin> k, i don't have a very long agenda
[09:02:30] <DaveMethvin> mainly want to get 1.9 together
[09:02:58] <DaveMethvin> any hope for Mergatron soon? i've become addicted to running tests on pull requests
[09:03:18] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yes, I have a working local version using MySQL
[09:03:29] <DaveMethvin> ah, great!
[09:03:38] <mikesherov> just need to coordinate some time with gnarf over the holiday weekend to get it integrated
[09:03:52] <DaveMethvin> ok so in the next week we hope
[09:04:16] <mikesherov> it'll be grunt style in deployment, in the sense that my goal is just to get the jenkins plugin running, and then at some point, develop additional plugins for other stuff we want like CLA sniffing
[09:04:35] <mikesherov> I'm fairly confident that this week will see a deployment
[09:04:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah once the framework is in place we might be able to get some people to add stuff
[09:05:05] <mikesherov> That's my hope
[09:05:10] <DaveMethvin> so it's not all on your/gnarf's shoulders
[09:05:21] <DaveMethvin> imma skip speed tests fro now
[09:05:35] <DaveMethvin> on documenting jQuery.find, we talked a bit about that last week
[09:05:37] <mikesherov> in all honesty, I've bitten off a lot right now, and have some personal stuff going on, otherwise, mergeatron would be deployed by now :-)
[09:05:42] <DaveMethvin> just wanted to formalize it
[09:05:51] <gnarf> In the realm of PRs - is anyone familiar with writing the code for the hooks API on github?
[09:06:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it could just point to Sizzle docs right?
[09:06:02] <mikesherov> yeah, good idea
[09:06:13] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: should we expose all the args?
[09:06:17] <DaveMethvin> that's what i wanted to ask
[09:06:26] <gnarf> github support is suggesting I delete the irc hooks from the old repos and try to turn it back on to see if I can get them listening to the new events
[09:06:39] <DaveMethvin> or should it be a different signature
[09:06:47] <DaveMethvin> Sizzle( selector, context, results, seed )
[09:06:59] <DaveMethvin> results in the middle works for us but seems strange as a public api
[09:07:10] <timmywil> it's already public
[09:07:35] <timmywil> at least in Sizzle docs.
[09:07:39] <DaveMethvin> well not in jQuery's docs
[09:07:47] <DaveMethvin> i don't think a lot of people use Sizzle directly
[09:07:55] <timmywil> actually, seed isn't public
[09:07:59] <DaveMethvin> AHA!
[09:08:07] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:08:13] <timmywil> :/
[09:08:33] <timmywil> but my point is the Sizzle docs can handle those kinds of questions rather than having two sets of docs
[09:08:56] <DaveMethvin> i think this would be the first time we exposed Sizzle though
[09:09:00] <DaveMethvin> so it's worth thinking about that
[09:09:14] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg!
[09:09:18] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:09:19] <bot-t> (121 hours ago) <seutje> tell jaubourg ajpiano could use some help with prnouncing your name :P
[09:09:21] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's still going to be used mainly by power users
[09:09:36] <DaveMethvin> perhaps not in the future tho timmywil
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> the goal is to let people be specific about what they are doing
[09:10:02] <jaubourg> sorry for being late, what are we talking about?
[09:10:02] <DaveMethvin> $(variable) can mean about 7 things
[09:10:13] <timmywil> I don't think we'll see a lot of $( $.find("div") )
[09:10:13] <DaveMethvin> exposing some method that just selects elements
[09:10:17] <timmywil> that should be the default
[09:10:35] <DaveMethvin> yes it will be
[09:10:45] <timmywil> and that would be a poor suggestion on our part
[09:10:47] <DaveMethvin> but if someone wanted to be sure they were selecting elemnts
[09:10:55] <DaveMethvin> they don't have a way to do that right now
[09:11:12] <jaubourg> hmmm... is that on the same ground as exposing "methods" that act on a single element? Still didn't get why this is useful
[09:11:25] <DaveMethvin> $(variable)  <--- what does that do?
[09:11:44] <DaveMethvin> it's really ambiguous
[09:11:53] <DaveMethvin> we even have two sigs that take strings
[09:12:11] <timmywil> sure, but I thought the html path was going to be more strict
[09:12:12] <DaveMethvin> so the idea is that sometimes you want to be sure of what you're doing
[09:12:22] <DaveMethvin> yes, it should be
[09:12:26] <jaubourg> hmmm... why is this suddenly a problem? It's been like this for ages and is probably one of the reasons why jQuery is so popular: $( something ) will always solve your problem
[09:12:32] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:12:37] <timmywil> $("<") is not a valid selector anyway
[09:13:00] <jaubourg> who complained about it being ambiguous?
[09:13:11] <DaveMethvin> it's an XSS vector for oen
[09:13:12] <DaveMethvin> one
[09:13:18] <jaubourg> (I may very well have missed a conversation)
[09:13:37] <timmywil> as far as calling methods, I think that should be the explicit codepath rather than jQuery.find
[09:13:50] <jaubourg> it still will be though, no? Wouldn't an option to specifically forbid html code in the constructor solve that issue?
[09:14:08] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: right if you use $.parseHTML to parse html
[09:14:18] <DaveMethvin> but if you use $( )
[09:14:27] <timmywil> The main use case I see for exposing jQuery.find is to get an array of elements so one doesn't have to do jQuery("div").get()
[09:15:07] <mikesherov> The only reason I was mentioning to expose $.select in the first place was to disambiguate
[09:15:17] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:15:27] <timmywil> but if we're trying to make selecting elements less ambiguous, I think we've done something really wrong with $()
[09:15:27] <mikesherov> I don't think we need new func here...
[09:15:29] <DaveMethvin> so someoene can be sure they are selecting and not creating  html
[09:15:42] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: if you have a security risk, offer a means to go around it by de-activating auto html parsing... exposing selection seems kinda silly for this use case
[09:15:45] <mikesherov> I'd want $.select('div') to do EXACTLY what $('div') does
[09:15:45] <timmywil> I don't see the need
[09:16:19] <DaveMethvin> i think $.select("div") would return an array not a jQuery object
[09:16:22] <mikesherov> I don't know if there's a need per se, except parity and short-circuiting anyway
[09:16:23] <jaubourg> because you're just telling people: don't use $( selector ) anymore
[09:16:24] <timmywil> again mikesherov: if we're trying to make selecting elements less ambiguous, I think we've done something really wrong with $()
[09:16:25] <DaveMethvin> like find
[09:16:33] <timmywil> jaubourg: +1
[09:16:49] <mikesherov> timmywil: makes sense
[09:17:16] <DaveMethvin> no we're telling people that if you have something and you want to be sure it's treated as selector/html/ready/whatever there are ways to do that
[09:17:23] * jaubourg hates it when he barges in after several weeks and just disagrees with something ;P
[09:17:38] <DaveMethvin> so it's not telling ppl to avoid $()
[09:17:42] <mikesherov> The only reason I mentioned it was to solidify in users minds that there is a non-magical way to be gauranteed the selection path
[09:17:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: they shouldn't have to specify unless it's something NOT a selector
[09:18:07] <timmywil> if there's a problem here, we should change it so they don't have to specify instead of adding a method
[09:18:31] <timmywil> I'm still fine with exposing jQuery.find, just not for this purpose
[09:18:58] <jaubourg> to be honest, I'd need actual use cases in a doc or something... I'd need to see the trade of and code samples to see what we're trying to achieve... seems very abstract right now
[09:19:11] <DaveMethvin> i think we should wait to expose jQuery.find if that is the use case
[09:19:17] <DaveMethvin> i'm stil not happy with that signature
[09:19:23] <DaveMethvin> the args are pretty funky
[09:19:47] <jaubourg> as if having methods with funky signatures ever stopped us before :P
[09:19:47] <DaveMethvin> so let's wait until we have the discussion about element methods which is 2.1 or later
[09:19:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: are they?
[09:19:58] <DaveMethvin> Sizzle( selector, context, results, seed )
[09:20:00] <timmywil> because of the "private" seed?
[09:20:12] <DaveMethvin> why doesn't it return results for example?
[09:20:20] <timmywil> it does
[09:20:23] <DaveMethvin> why do you pass them in?
[09:20:32] <timmywil> in case results is array-like instead of just an array
[09:20:42] <timmywil> Sizzle pushes to a jQuery object directly
[09:20:49] <DaveMethvin> it's just unlike any other sig we  have
[09:20:58] <DaveMethvin> so that's why i'm hesitant to expose as it is
[09:21:06] <DaveMethvin> it's convenient for our internal use
[09:21:18] <DaveMethvin> but that doesn't mean it shoudl be exposed the same way
[09:21:39] <DaveMethvin> so in any case...is everyone okay with not exposing this for 1.9?
[09:21:56] <mikesherov> sure, I defer to you guys on this
[09:22:06] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't seem like an urgent need
[09:22:16] <timmywil> ok, I guess I'm thinking if the point is to expose Sizzle, then the args make sense (these are pretty common args for a selector engine minus the seed argument)
[09:22:20] <jaubourg> we probably should defer big API changes/additions to 2.1+
[09:22:40] <timmywil> if the point is to expose something else, I don't think we should change Sizzle's args
[09:23:10] <DaveMethvin> alright, let's look at tix
[09:23:22] <DaveMethvin> trac has been slow lately
[09:23:25] <DaveMethvin> it was good for a while
[09:23:42] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: can you take a look at the ajax tix?
[09:24:05] <jaubourg> yeah, I'll have some time finally... saw the IE10 xhr on win7 debacle
[09:24:36] <DaveMethvin> it sounded like they'd already fixed it in the latest ie10 on windows 8 but not on the preview for win7
[09:24:47] <jaubourg> seems like it
[09:25:03] <jaubourg> gotta give credit to people not being helpful in the report :/
[09:25:15] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not sure what the problem is with trac
[09:25:23] <gnarf> no cpu issues or anything
[09:25:24] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: can you look at those two unassigned selector problems?
[09:25:40] <jaubourg> I don't think I've seen any other big ajax bug but I wasn't that focussed on bugs these days
[09:25:59] <mikesherov> do we have a target date for 1.9?
[09:26:07] <mikesherov> I need some motivation / fear
[09:26:14] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to get an early beta out in about two weeks
[09:26:30] <DaveMethvin> we're shooting for mid-january for the final
[09:26:41] <DaveMethvin> but i wanted to get 2.0 going in december
[09:26:58] <DaveMethvin> btw mikesherov http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9628
[09:27:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yea, I'm inclined to say wontfix for one and the other is about removing the boolHook
[09:27:29] <DaveMethvin> gulp, boolHook
[09:27:40] <jaubourg> even the name sounds clunky ;)
[09:27:41] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I responded to Boris
[09:27:41] <timmywil> yea :/
[09:28:08] <DaveMethvin> it is kind of strange that we allow fractions in .position() but not in .width()
[09:28:23] <DaveMethvin> but it's all so screwed up anyway
[09:28:34] <DaveMethvin> we need some standard to follow when it comes to fractional px
[09:28:36] <jaubourg> anyway, about 2.0, shouldn't we, like, split the lib in pieces so that we don't walk on someone else's feet?
[09:28:57] <DaveMethvin> i thought we could do that branch once the 1.9 beta came otu
[09:28:57] <DaveMethvin> out
[09:29:06] <jaubourg> ok
[09:29:22] <DaveMethvin> i didn't want to branch too soon b/c we'll be doing a lot of cherry picking and working in two places
[09:29:25] <jaubourg> I'll be happy to re-write/architecture Callbacks/Deferred/ajax
[09:29:38] <jaubourg> so you guys don't have to worry about those
[09:29:38] <DaveMethvin> in 2.0 it's all fair game
[09:30:03] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil what do you think about the boolHook?
[09:30:12] <timmywil> I'm confused on the `.width()` one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't we return what the browser returns? I thought it was just that some browsers return floats and some don't
[09:30:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'd love to remove it, but it will break code for sure
[09:30:44] <timmywil> until 1.6, we recommended attr for changing the dynamic value of a checkbox
[09:30:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah i know timmywil it's a question of whether we can survive the complaints :D
[09:31:14] <DaveMethvin> if we don't take it out now i think its likely to be in forever
[09:31:18] <timmywil> if we're ever going to do it, 1.9/2.0 is probably a good time
[09:31:20] <DaveMethvin> which isn't necessarily horrible
[09:31:32] <DaveMethvin> it's just not very consistent
[09:31:37] <mikesherov> timmywil: some return floats, but we clobber with parseInt
[09:31:52] <timmywil> ah, didn't know that
[09:32:00] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: that's another one where 1.9 would be a good time to "fix" it
[09:32:31] <DaveMethvin> it really seems like we should be returning the best number the browser has
[09:32:37] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: overall I'm +1 for removing the boolHook. It will break code, but it is closer to real javascript
[09:32:39] <mikesherov> timmywil: actually, we clobber with parseFloat
[09:32:50] <mikesherov> hmmm…. not sure why that doesn't work now either
[09:33:19] <DaveMethvin> okay timmywil let's take it out
[09:33:22] <mikesherov> I'll reopen that one then, and see what I can do. Will need docs, but, whatever
[09:33:27] <DaveMethvin> we can always put it back in if the yelling gets too loud
[09:33:30] <timmywil> woo!
[09:33:33] <DaveMethvin> also it will go in the compat plugin
[09:33:43] <timmywil> good idea
[09:33:51] <timmywil> we'll have to migrate some tests also
[09:33:55] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:34:01] <mikesherov> WAIT
[09:34:05] <DaveMethvin> TOO LATE
[09:34:06] <mikesherov> WAIT A GOSHDARN SECOND
[09:34:10] <timmywil> heh
[09:34:13] <jaubourg> TOO LATE WE SAID
[09:34:15] <jaubourg> :P
[09:34:16] <mikesherov> Did we just agree to remove boolHook for 1.9?
[09:34:27] <DaveMethvin> where the heck were you mikesherov?? :D
[09:34:38] <jaubourg> anyway, I gotta fly, sorry for being a mere presence in the background these days
[09:34:45] <timmywil> jaubourg: <3
[09:34:49] <DaveMethvin> btw jaubourg imma  remove global triggered events here soon
[09:34:49] <gnarf> finally
[09:34:52] <DaveMethvin> moving to the compat plugin
[09:34:56] <timmywil> mikesherov: objection?
[09:35:09] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: great :)
[09:35:10] <gnarf> timmywil: only 3 versions after I said boolHook was terrible idea for the future we get to remove it ;)
[09:35:21] <DaveMethvin> such is backcompat
[09:35:21] <jaubourg> cya around guys
[09:35:23] <mikesherov> No, no objetion
[09:35:26] <DaveMethvin> at least we have a plugin for that stuff
[09:35:28] <timmywil> lol
[09:35:32] <mikesherov> I thought you should've stood your ground in 1.6!
[09:35:41] <DaveMethvin> the favicon for the jquery-compat plugin should be a toilet
[09:35:43] <mikesherov> I just wanted to be clear I was hearing right
[09:35:44] <gnarf> I did - my ground just lost to resig ;)
[09:35:55] <timmywil> resig had the final word on that one
[09:36:06] <DaveMethvin> well he ain't here now!
[09:36:06] <timmywil> made the masses happy tho
[09:36:09] <gnarf> agree
[09:36:14] <DaveMethvin> now we can make them sad
[09:36:22] <gnarf> our favorite thing todo
[09:36:26] <DaveMethvin> but they will have the compat plugin
[09:36:29] <timmywil> besides, now that we've educated a little more, maybe it's a better time
[09:36:37] <mikesherov> it'll never be the right time
[09:36:43] <timmywil> true nuff
[09:36:48] <DaveMethvin> imma break your leg but on the bright side here's a crutch
[09:36:56] <gnarf> we need a really good learn.jquery.com article on attropeties /cc ajpiano
[09:36:56] <mikesherov> we can only ever do it at the wrong time
[09:37:09] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:37:11] <mikesherov> this wrong time is as good as any
[09:37:17] <timmywil> the docs on prop are a good place to start
[09:37:17] <ajpiano> i think we are giong to commandeer some of timmywil's blog posts
[09:37:30] <timmywil> or that :)
[09:37:36] <DaveMethvin> just like the ticket this morning where the guy wanted us to fix 1.5.1 b/c he didn't have time to test a later version
[09:37:50] <DaveMethvin> okay, assigned tix
[09:37:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: "dbr" tag? :)
[09:38:00] <mikesherov> dbr tag!
[09:38:02] <timmywil> hey, remember when david mark said it was a bad idea to add prop?
[09:38:08] <DaveMethvin> no that's a "lazy ass" tag
[09:38:24] <timmywil> anyways
[09:38:29] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should deprecate .prop() in 1.9 then :)
[09:38:35] <timmywil> lol
[09:38:39] <mikesherov> nonono
[09:38:51] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron still holds the record for most assigned tix
[09:38:56] <mikesherov> it would be usePropIfOnABrowserThatSupportsProperties()
[09:39:11] <DaveMethvin> LEAVE MY LIBRARY ALONE!
[09:39:20] <mikesherov> no, its MY library
[09:39:30] <gnarf> I wish I could remember what arschmitz danheberden rworth julian kborchers etc came up with for the "dbr"
[09:39:45] <mikesherov> ?
[09:40:00] <mikesherov> dbr is a healthy collection now
[09:40:00] <arschmitz> dedicated branch request
[09:40:02] <gnarf> we came up with what dbr could stand for that wasn't what it is
[09:40:06] <gnarf> ah yeah
[09:40:07] <mikesherov> OHHH
[09:40:08] <gnarf> dedicated branch request
[09:40:09] <gnarf> :)
[09:40:11] <mikesherov> nice
[09:40:18] <timmywil> lol
[09:40:22] <mikesherov> as if you can't tell just by reading them
[09:40:41] <DaveMethvin> so i think we've been making slow progress towards 1.9 but the actual bugs here don't look too tough. Does everyone think they can get theirs done in the next couple of weeks?
[09:40:42] <mikesherov> MY THING WON'T DOWNLOAD: I go to the download page, and click download, and all I get is a huge page of code! help?
[09:41:00] <gnarf> mikesherov: we can fix it in a dedicated branch right?
[09:41:12] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yeah, I've bitten off a bit of UI, and mergeatron, and testswarm, and core
[09:41:26] <mikesherov> I just need to prioritize, so if there's a date, I'll hit it
[09:41:35] <gnarf> mikesherov: when do you want to work on merge?
[09:41:44] <mikesherov> gnarf: can you do some time on Saturday?
[09:41:46] <DaveMethvin> i still have the call for help that will go out, so if you have something that maybe could use one of our recent contribs that might be a possiblity
[09:41:57] * Krinkle tunes in
[09:41:59] <gnarf> mikesherov:  seems possible
[09:42:05] <mikesherov> I know it's not ideal., given the weekend
[09:42:23] <gnarf> mikesherov: eh - easier for me, don't have to worry about the 3 contracts hassling me on sat. :)
[09:42:32] <DaveMethvin> are you kidding? holidays are the only time i can get anything done!
[09:42:32] <mikesherov> yup, that's the way I feel
[09:42:40] <DaveMethvin> exactly
[09:43:19] <DaveMethvin> so yeah, if we could get a beta out for people to test early in december, that would be great
[09:43:29] <mikesherov> btw, I just want to call out that pbramos has been helpful lately, good communicator
[09:43:35] <DaveMethvin> let people try 1.9 with/without the compat plugin
[09:43:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah pbramos is coming along
[09:43:51] <DaveMethvin> i want to get a few others participating too
[09:44:00] <mikesherov> gibson042 has been working well with him, hopefully he steals some of that knowledge from gibson
[09:44:11] <gnarf> anyone look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1024 btw?
[09:44:20] <DaveMethvin> and gibson has been mentoring him, great job
[09:44:40] * timmywil needs food
[09:44:46] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: looked good to me
[09:44:50] <gnarf> k
[09:45:02] <gnarf> im gonna try gibsons suggestion see if it can recover some bytes
[09:45:02] <DaveMethvin> okay i think that does it
[09:45:15] <DaveMethvin> yell if you need help with your tickets
[09:45:27] <timmywil> AHHHHHHHHHH
[09:45:30] <DaveMethvin> and have fun over thanksgiving!
[09:45:32] <timmywil> jk
[09:45:38] <DaveMethvin> you'll have plenty of time for food this week timmywil
