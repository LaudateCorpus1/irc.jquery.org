[09:04:09] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:04:10] <rxaviers> Hey!
[09:04:11] <mikesherov> yooooo
[09:04:13] <arschmitz> hello
[09:04:23] <mikesherov> jQUERY UI, ASSEMBLE
[09:04:26] <kborchers> hey
[09:04:36] <mikesherov> kborchers: love the mission statement work, btw
[09:04:51] <kborchers> mikesherov: thanks :) and thanks for your feedback
[09:05:10] <fnagel> hey
[09:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> I started discussion the button refactor with arschmitz.
[09:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> We went over the API in UI and Mobile and came up with the new propsoed API.
[09:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFD_Y9QuuMTI4NOc-JQYRjPTrcVV52h7ZeLKLPbSj40/edit
[09:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> Basically the same as what we have in UI today.
[09:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have a use case for 2 icons in a button?
[09:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> We couldn't think of any, so we want to drop support to a single icon.
[09:06:38] <mikesherov> well, if I'm an insane person...
[09:06:50] <jzaefferer> seems fine, since we have an example for how to build a split button
[09:07:17] <mikesherov> I have no use case for a two icon button
[09:07:22] <tj_vantoll> Split button is the only use case I can think of.
[09:07:24] <kborchers> i can't think of a use either
[09:07:49] <fnagel> Yes, split button
[09:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so split button is actually two separate buttons, so that's easily handled.
[09:08:13] <mikesherov> but split button is really just a buttonset though, right?
[09:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, switch the icons option to icon.
[09:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: yup
[09:08:32] <mikesherov> so, no single button should have two icons
[09:08:50] <arschmitz> yeah seems like bad ui to have two icons in general
[09:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> Should we add an icon position option?
[09:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> To control left, right, top, bottom?
[09:09:36] <tj_vantoll> That might be nice.
[09:09:50] <kborchers> agree
[09:09:59] <arschmitz> with out the two icons its the only way to move from right to left before it was just based on primary / secondary
[09:10:03] <tj_vantoll> left vs right at least is fairly common.
[09:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so the next question is trickier.
[09:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> Since buttons are mostly just styling, it'd be really nice if we had pure CSS buttons.
[09:11:40] <arschmitz> we have this in mobile already
[09:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> So something like <button class="ui-button ui-corner-all">...</button> should get you the same look as $( "<button>" ).button();
[09:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with this is in order to not have to manually add `ui-widget`, we'd need to include theming rules in the ui-button styles.
[09:12:41] <rxaviers> I like this to be handled by CSS
[09:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> Which is a deviation from how our CSS works now.
[09:13:02] <tj_vantoll> hmmmm
[09:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we'd have mixins.
[09:13:16] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: how does that part work in mobile?
[09:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> And we'd just mix ui-widget into ui-button and ui-widget would never actually show up in the markup.
[09:13:31] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: all based on ui-btn class
[09:13:35] <arschmitz> so the same
[09:13:57] <arschmitz> one difference though is
[09:14:04] <arschmitz> in mobile we have the idea on inheritance
[09:14:20] <arschmitz> so you dont have to define every style rule in ui-btn
[09:14:32] <arschmitz> because it will inherit from the closest parent
[09:15:11] <arschmitz> ui does not really have this concept so it would all have to be directly defined as part of ui-button
[09:16:33] <arschmitz> if there is no parent it will be missing theme related styles unless you set a theme class directly or via option
[09:16:52] <arschmitz> on the button it self
[09:17:32] <rxaviers> perhaps this is useful to grab some ideas https://github.com/styleguide/css/1.0
[09:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> They don't have any of the concerns that we do.
[09:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's a decent reference for pure CSS buttons.
[09:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't address the concern of splitting style from function.
[09:20:56] <arschmitz> one option would be to create a theme class
[09:21:15] <arschmitz> that just contains the theme things like background font etc
[09:21:33] <arschmitz> so then you would have to add ui-button ui-theme ui-corner-all
[09:21:38] <tj_vantoll> That's really what ui-widget is doing now though.
[09:21:55] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: execpt when its pure css its not a widget
[09:22:10] <arschmitz> so it semantically makes no sense
[09:22:15] <tj_vantoll> True
[09:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it does make sense.
[09:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> ui-widget is a CSS object for theming. It's not actually related to JS functionality.
[09:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's kind of like OOCSS in that regard.
[09:22:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i just meant the name
[09:22:59] <tj_vantoll> I really don't think it's the end of the world to have someone provide <button class="ui-button ui-widget ui-corner-all"> for a CSS only button for now.
[09:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, all form controls are widgets. Whether they're native or JS.
[09:23:18] <arschmitz> true
[09:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so requiring the manual use of ui-widget for now seems fine to me too.
[09:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> Eventually we'll have native mixins and then we can stop using ui-widget and ui-corner-all :-)
[09:23:50] <tj_vantoll> If you want to not have to provide all those classes then just call .button().
[09:23:58] <tj_vantoll> yeah
[09:24:55] <jzaefferer> Leaving out "ui-widget" will make it easier to provide your own theme, without having to override anything
[09:25:04] <arschmitz> yup
[09:25:06] <jzaefferer> So that might even be an advantage
[09:25:29] <jzaefferer> Theming jQuery Mobile is certainly easier without its theme CSS
[09:25:42] <arschmitz> oh course
[09:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so it sounds like we've got a plan.
[09:25:54] <fnagel> tj_vantoll: I don't think that will be used a lot at all because most people use a framework for styling buttons.
[09:25:55] <arschmitz> no need to worry about crazy specificty or overrides
[09:27:45] <arschmitz> ok i need to run to get to the airport in time to make my flight for the accessibility summit
[09:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> Later arschmitz.
[09:28:03] <arschmitz> but it there is anything else ill make sure to read back scroll once i get there
[09:28:16] <tj_vantoll> safe travels
[09:28:24] <arschmitz> thanks
[09:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of the accessibility summit, I put together a doc for some topics to discuss: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MFM0zaLt-Gqaj3Ajv2p5d-STuaEZ6MoqfpYANX1VgpM/edit
[09:28:45] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone has anything to add to that list, let me know.
[09:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers and arschmitz will be there.
[09:30:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: would be nice to get someone to evaluate aria-autocomplete. See if things got any better, and it can be used and if the spec should be changed to actually be more useful. One day our autocomplete widget should get rid of the live-region hack and do it properly
[09:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oops, fixed the permissions on that.
[09:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Everyone can comment view and comment now.
[09:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: added
[09:32:48] <kborchers> we'll see what we can get accomplished â€¦ most of the time there are talks and then the last half or so of the second day is meant to hack on stuff
[09:32:51] <jzaefferer> I saw a related Mobile ticket earlier today: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6196 - added that to the doc as well
[09:32:51] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #6196 by uGoMobi (2mon 2w ago): Filterable: input label and ARIA attribute
[09:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, I got 3 requests to share that doc, each in a different language :-P
[09:33:51] <rxaviers> :)
[09:37:49] <mikesherov> just so the team knows, I will be getting more free time starting around 3.5 weeks from now, so I'll be way more active than I've been in the past few months
[09:38:16] <mikesherov> Also, my newborn twins are just about 3 months old, so I should have some more free awake time at night as well
[09:38:40] <tj_vantoll> That's a good milestone :)
[09:39:23] <rxaviers> amazing, glad to hear
[09:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be great to have you back mikesherov :-)
[09:39:51] <mikesherov> thanks, and again, apologies for my relative inactivity.
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> Perfectly understandable.
[09:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on Pointer Events.
[09:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> Slowly making progress (I think).
[09:43:06] <jzaefferer> What repo or whatever are you working in?
[09:44:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working locally. Trying to get this working.
[09:44:33] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Want to pair on this after the meeting?
[09:45:30] <jzaefferer> Last dialog ticket I've been working on is http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9101#comment:12 - my implementation wasn't working and I didn't figure out the issue. Its been a few days since, been working on other stuff
[09:45:48] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how about tomorrow?
[09:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:46:06] <jzaefferer> ping me when you're online
[09:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe some miracle will occur and I'll even get it working by then :-P
[09:46:10] <scott_gonzalez> will do
[09:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:46:35] <jzaefferer> fnagel: any update on selectmenu?
[09:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> I know fnagel is still waiting on me for some stuff.
[09:47:35] <scott_gonzalez> Though with the menu update that landed, we need to rip out the anchors.
[09:47:46] <jzaefferer> Well, that's something
[09:47:48] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: I guess you'll be working on 'Documenting return values' before going back to Datepicker?
[09:48:16] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'll probably finish that up just to wrap up the docs updates.
[09:48:24] <tj_vantoll> I landed the method examples yesterday.
[09:48:38] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: nice. Make sure to tag to actually publish the changes.
[09:48:53] <tj_vantoll> Alright I can do that now.
[09:49:01] <fnagel> right, I've implemented something regarding width just to have somethign to discuss, see wiki!
[09:49:19] <fnagel> I will check the anchor think today
[09:49:26] <fnagel> anchor change
[09:52:19] <jzaefferer> fnagel: that should be farely easy, just skip generating the "<a>" when building the markup
[09:52:41] <jzaefferer> though you may need to set menu's new items option to deal with delimiters or other non-menu items
[09:55:45] <fnagel> jzaefferer: I will check this. Propbaly we could get rid of a small hack that way too.
[09:57:46] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it.
[09:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
