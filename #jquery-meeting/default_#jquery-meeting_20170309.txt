[12:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> hey bethge
[12:01:36] <bethge> Hi!
[12:01:52] <bethge> About to create a PR for Element.hasPointerCapture
[12:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> Great!
[12:05:10] <bethge> Hmm ... might be have run into some timing issues, will have to double check this.
[12:05:30] <bethge> Anywho, I was wondering, if the function should throw, if the pointerId is unknown
[12:06:05] <bethge> set- and releasePointerCapture do. But the spec doesn't really mention it.
[12:06:23] <bethge> (for hasPointerCapture) so ... probably it should not throw?
[12:06:37] <bethge> ~> https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#dom-element-haspointercapture
[12:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, probably just return false.
[12:08:02] <bethge> Alrighty. There has been some trouble with my propagate function *yikes*
[12:08:50] <bethge> ~> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/326
[12:11:38] <bethge> The quick fix of testing for null would stop it from throwing any errors
[12:12:27] <bethge> and with the already landed fix for IE10, this hopefully quites things down on that front
[12:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:13:16] <bethge> I will create a PR
[12:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[12:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[12:21:48] <bethge> Probably forgetting something, but thats all I can come up with
[12:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll try to get a release out to address https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/337
[12:23:20] <bethge> Great
[12:23:48] <bethge> We should try to merge a fix for #326 before shipping
[12:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:24:36] <bethge> I will get on that right after dinner ... iirc it's just a simple test for null, but i will double check
[12:24:53] <bethge> <-- Europe/Berlin tmz :D
[12:25:58] <bethge> Sorry for causing that bug :(
[12:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
