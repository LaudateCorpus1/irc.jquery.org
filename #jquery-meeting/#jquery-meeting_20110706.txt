[09:01:18] <rworth> hey all
[09:01:27] <danheberden> brb - coffee refill
[09:02:51] <danheberden> oh hai
[09:03:15] <rworth> ok, let's get started
[09:03:23] <rworth> danheberden: go ahead
[09:03:31] <RWhitbeck> I am here but have to leave soon...Jörn asked me to attend to discuss UI talks at the conference.  Can we start there first?
[09:03:37] <danheberden> not much - my infra guys are disappearing
[09:03:47] <rworth> RWhitbeck: sure, go first
[09:03:49] <danheberden> except those busy ones that had time to fix the dl builder
[09:04:06] <danheberden> but on to RWhitbeck
[09:04:09] <danheberden> :D
[09:04:36] <RWhitbeck> I am not sure why Jörn wanted to discuss it here so will someone else start?
[09:04:57] <rworth> is ajpiano here ?
[09:05:14] <RWhitbeck> I am planning on submitting a talk based on my script Junkie article Intro to building Complex UI's with jQuery Ui
[09:05:43] <rworth> anyone else planning on submitting a UI talk, scott_gonzalez: yes?
[09:05:50] <danheberden> ooh i was thinking about a talk like that this morning - that would be awesome RWhitbeck
[09:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> yes, API redesign
[09:07:11] <ajpiano> rworth: i am now, was in the bathroom
[09:07:14] <rworth> anything else to discuss on this topic? Seems like jzaefferer and ajpiano might have the most to say and neither are here
[09:07:19] <rworth> ajpiano: there he is
[09:07:33] <danheberden> wat, you don't take your laptop with you ajpiano?
[09:07:51] <RWhitbeck> poopin'
[09:07:59] <ajpiano> no, just ipad
[09:08:33] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: is that meant to kind of fill the "Intro To UI" slot?
[09:08:52] <RWhitbeck> I think this talk could be the intro to jQuery talk.  Be a different take on the past talks were we see what can be built using most of the widgets/interactions then seeing them one at a time
[09:09:04] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano I think it could
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> is there something specific we're supposed to be talking about?
[09:10:36] <ajpiano> no - like i said in my e-mail yesterday
[09:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's get back to infrastructure then
[09:10:53] <ajpiano> we should all just propose the talks were were planning to propose and see how the chips fall when everything's in
[09:11:08] <rworth> ok infra danheberden
[09:11:10] <RWhitbeck> I wasn't included in that thread so maybe that's why I was asked to discuss it here?
[09:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> this isn't a topic that should be on the agenda
[09:11:35] <RWhitbeck> OK I'll just submit it.   Thanks
[09:11:38] <rworth> ok
[09:11:46] <danheberden> sigh
[09:12:18] <danheberden> anyway - not much on infra, i haven't heard back from clarkbox on where he's at with the dir listing ( as of last week, he was gonna dig into it )
[09:12:37] <danheberden> eddie's been missing from what seems to be all channels, so i'm having an infra issue of lack of manpower
[09:12:45] <danheberden> which, ajpiano, i'd like to talk to you later about if we could
[09:12:48] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:12:53] <ajpiano> we could trawl that list for more people if you want
[09:13:02] <danheberden> yeah
[09:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: docs?
[09:14:10] <rworth> no update, on the docket for this week
[09:14:20] <danheberden> i have a small concern re: docs
[09:14:30] <danheberden> i noticed an email from karl about implementing with core
[09:14:43] <rworth> yeah, saw that this morning
[09:14:46] <danheberden> a topic that had already been discussed with karl when we started this before
[09:15:08] <danheberden> i'm afraid the same topics are being discussed, etc - so wondering if i need to outline any of that plan somewhere?
[09:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: you can document it on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40995891/Docs2xml
[09:15:54] <danheberden> k
[09:18:18] <rworth> menu and menubar
[09:18:32] <rworth> kborchers around?
[09:18:48] <kborchers> i sent a pull req for the left/right, expand/collapse change, pretty straight forward https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/377
[09:19:26] <kborchers> i have also implemented the autoExpand option in Menubar, here is a fiddle so if people are ok with that i can send a pull for that today http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/RArZj/
[09:20:08] <rworth> can we get some hoverIntent on there?
[09:21:19] <kborchers> sure, i can look into that
[09:21:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need to either fix hoverintent or rebuild it as a UI plugin
[09:21:35] <rworth> it's broken?
[09:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, if you try to call any methods on the event, it throws an error in IE
[09:21:54] <rworth> fun
[09:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> and we're using it in an accordion or tabs demo
[09:23:17] <rworth> we should test this one https://github.com/LeMisterV/jquery.hoverintent
[09:23:49] <rworth> anything else on menu for now?
[09:24:17] <kborchers> going to move the input stuff from my visual test into menu and send a pull soon as well
[09:24:55] <rworth> awesome, just played a bit more with the autoExpand, looks good. I'd like to think a bit more on the API (or was it previously discussed?)
[09:25:58] <kborchers> not sure, i wasn't involved in any of those discussions jzaefferer just asked me to implement autoExpand while I was working on the other menu stuff
[09:26:14] <rworth> ok
[09:26:47] <rworth> tooltip
[09:27:01] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: have you had a chance to review Chris Bannon's comments?
[09:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:28:23] <rworth> can you this week?
[09:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> not sure
[09:29:52] <rworth> ok, 1.6.x, any update?
[09:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had any time to work on anything
[09:31:31] <rworth> good holiday?
[09:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, lots of fireworks :-)
[09:33:15] <rworth> :)
[09:33:47] <rworth> next is Accordion, do we need to discuss that, or just assign to someone to review?
[09:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> need the team to say yes or no
[09:35:49] <kborchers> here's a fiddle showing that pull in action for those that want to play with it again http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YpFfN/
[09:37:18] <rworth> kborchers: I see how that's working but not how it's being pulled in
[09:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> manage resources on the left
[09:37:41] <rworth> oh, in manage resources it only shows filenames
[09:37:46] <rworth> you have to hover to see the full url
[09:37:47] <rworth> ok
[09:38:26] <rworth> I like it
[09:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> so I think this is like the third week that it's been on the agenda
[09:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> nobody has said no yet
[09:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> so we're probably good to land it
[09:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll comment on the implementation
[09:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok, added comments on the pull
[09:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> no update on testing
[09:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> haven't heard anything from Felix since we added the redis logging
[09:43:20] <rworth> ok
[09:43:26] <rworth> that look like it
[09:44:00] <rworth> thanks everyone
[09:51:57] <ajpiano> :)
[10:00:39] <rworth> ok, grid meeting time
[10:01:41] <rworth> hey borismoore
[10:01:48] <rworth> anyone else around for the grid mtg?
[10:01:51] <borismoore> Hey Richard
[10:02:00] <borismoore> Brad is OOF on vacation this week
[10:02:11] <rworth> jzaefferer also could not make it
[10:02:21] <rworth> I know a lot of people are still out for the 4th
[10:02:28] <borismoore> Ah so it is just the two of us!
[10:02:32] <rworth> :)
[10:02:48] <borismoore> We could do a quick Skype syncup
[10:02:55] <rworth> let's do that
[10:03:01] <borismoore> ok cool
