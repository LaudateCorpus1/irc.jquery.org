[12:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: What's up?
[12:07:43] <bethge> Hi!
[12:07:51] <bethge> Sorry havent been around for too long
[12:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> Just going through the issues and PRs that Patrick filed yesterday.
[12:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, I've been pretty busy too.
[12:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm currently looking at https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/332
[12:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> We obviously can't provide any real values here, but I'm not sure that setting `maxTouchPoints` to 0 is a great idea.
[12:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that in practice any user code is going to handle 0 better than 1.
[12:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> But at least 1 will sometimes be correct (if only mouse is supported).
[12:09:51] <bethge> "value of greater than 0 indicates the user's device is capable of supporting touch input"
[12:10:12] <bethge> mouse isn't touch, is it? ^^
[12:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> You know, I'm actually not sure. It does seem like this is specifically talking about touch points and not other pointer types.
[12:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> But that doesn't seem like what's it should be talking about.
[12:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> However, there is this note: "On platforms where the precise number of touch points is not known, the minimum number guaranteed to be recognized is provided. Therefore, it is possible for the number of recognized touch points to exceed the value of maxTouchPoints."
[12:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> So setting to 0 would still be considered valid.
[12:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess we can just do that.
[12:12:04] <bethge> Yeah, I agree with it feeling odd though
[12:13:19] <bethge> But you are right, it is valid
[12:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> We can add it and then update the wording in https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/334/files to say that PEP always sets the value to 0.
[12:14:57] <bethge> Yeah, that sounds good
[12:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitely add the new `hasPointerCapture` method as well.
[12:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/333
[12:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> That should be a simple addition, though not quite as simple as just setting `maxTouchPoints` to 0 :-P
[12:18:35] <bethge> Haha
[12:18:44] <bethge> yeah, I can look into that
[12:19:34] <bethge> I am really really sorry, I have an appointment in 10 minutes
[12:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> That's fine. I'll mark you down for `hasPointerCapture` and I'll take care of the rest of Patricks issues.
[12:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you don't have anything else to discuss today?
[12:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> Our main priority at this point should just be getting the test suite updated.
[12:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> And also figuring out how we want to handle local testing now.
[12:21:28] <bethge> All good :) This weekend I will catch up on the changes in the spec
[12:21:32] <bethge> yeah
[12:21:42] <bethge> safari \o/
[12:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, BTW, I will be out of the country from the 11th to the 29th.
[12:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> So I won't be available.
[12:22:03] <bethge> Ok, good to know
[12:22:21] <bethge> Shall we meet next week?
[12:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> And after that, we'll resume in April.
[12:23:17] <bethge> Ok great, by then I will be up to date.
[12:23:48] <bethge> Thanks for the meeting, talk to you soon!
[12:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. Enjoy the rest of your day.
[14:26:27] <arschmitz> cgack: cogwurx: meeting
[14:26:40] <cogwurx> I'm here
[14:26:41] <cgack> for reals?
[14:26:42] <arschmitz> apsdehal:
[14:26:45] <apsdehal> Hey
[14:26:55] <arschmitz> yeah cogwurx and i met last week no one else was here
[14:27:17] <apsdehal> Are my messages getting through?
[14:27:29] <cogwurx> I see you @apsdehal
[14:27:45] <apsdehal> Bouncer was offline whole time, I was disconnected lol
[14:27:56] <cogwurx> bummer
[14:28:05] <arschmitz> ok so 2 things to really discuss this week first is API
[14:28:16] <arschmitz> apsdehal: you were working on getting that setup did you have any luck?
[14:28:47] <apsdehal> Didn't get any time this week, had mid exams, now I am somewhat this weekend, will try now.
[14:28:55] <apsdehal> *somewhat free
[14:29:20] <arschmitz> execlent i got the blog post all written just need to add links to the api once its live
[14:29:57] <apsdehal> I have once before setup that box to test the website, so I guess setting up won't be an issue
[14:31:01] <apsdehal> And about that issue, I believe we should lock and only we can further make announcements on it.
[14:31:14] <apsdehal> There is no fun in getting constant nagging
[14:31:24] <arschmitz> cogwurx: cgack your feelings on locking that issue?
[14:31:40] <cogwurx> which issue would that be?
[14:32:07] <cgack> is that the "is jqm dead?" issue?
[14:32:16] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8546
[14:32:54] <cgack> I'm not sure it looks good to lock it honestly.
[14:33:56] <apsdehal> Maybe close it then?
[14:35:15] <cgack> close it when we release 1.5
[14:35:22] <arschmitz> cgack: it has been released
[14:35:29] <arschmitz> just the api is not published
[14:35:42] <apsdehal> arschmitz: what should we do about, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8546 , IIRC you said you will take care of it ?
[14:35:49] <cgack> and jquerymobile.com is not updated then either?
[14:35:59] <arschmitz> cgack:  it is updated
[14:36:10] <apsdehal> It is just not published.
[14:36:21] <apsdehal> Changelog is there
[14:36:23] <arschmitz> its published everywhere execpt npm
[14:36:30] <cgack> i'm seeing latest version 1.4.5
[14:36:39] <arschmitz> cgack thats latest stable
[14:36:43] <arschmitz> 1.5 is still alpha
[14:36:45] <cgack> so not released
[14:36:54] <cgack> sorry semantics i suppose
[14:36:59] <cgack> but we leave it open till 1.5 is final
[14:37:04] <cgack> in my opinion
[14:37:09] <arschmitz> i for sure dont think until final
[14:37:22] <cgack> as a user i don't even know where to find the alpha
[14:37:23] <cogwurx> agree with cgack
[14:37:26] <apsdehal> no issues with me.
[14:37:28] <arschmitz> until blog post announces perhaps
[14:37:35] <arschmitz> but not final
[14:37:53] <cgack> maybe close it after we can link to a blog post
[14:37:58] <cgack> at the very earliest
[14:38:04] <arschmitz> that was my original thoughts
[14:38:11] <cgack> i'm down with that
[14:39:17] <apsdehal> We didn't participate in GSoC this year?
[14:39:29] <arschmitz> the foundation as a whole did not
[14:40:02] <apsdehal> was a good place to get regular contributors
[14:40:13] <arschmitz> yes
[14:40:39] <apsdehal> arschmitz: will take care of npm package?
[14:40:45] <arschmitz> yup
[14:40:48] <apsdehal> *will you :p
[14:40:59] <apsdehal> Great
[14:40:59] <arschmitz> i was the only person willing to admin for GSOC and i didnt have time to do it alone
[14:41:19] <apsdehal> Oh
[14:42:10] <apsdehal> Anything else to be taken care of?
[14:42:26] <apsdehal> Once this is done, I guess we can start working on 1.6?
[14:42:35] <arschmitz> once we have the api set we just need to give a couple weeks for issues and fix any critical ones
[14:42:40] <arschmitz> for beta
[14:43:05] <arschmitz> and yes we need to have a good talk among those of us left about priorities and timeline for 1.6
[14:43:33] <apsdehal> We should reply on this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8559
[14:43:57] <arschmitz> ill take care of that
[14:44:36] <apsdehal> I will try to check on in other 1.5-alpha issues
[14:45:11] <arschmitz> yes if anyone has time to get a list of 1.5 issues that will be a big helpp
[14:46:44] <apsdehal> Two of which I can see:
[14:46:45] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8551
[14:46:55] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8550
[14:47:55] <sfrisk__> oo meeting!
[14:48:10] <arschmitz> the second one does not seem legit
[14:48:13] <arschmitz> but first does
[14:51:09] <apsdehal> http://jsbin.com/xosulekuke/1/edit?html,output
[14:51:29] <apsdehal> For second, HTML atleast seems correct, though need to look thoroughly
[14:57:05] <arschmitz> <div role="main" class="ui-content" align="center">
[14:57:09] <arschmitz> thats not valid html
[14:58:43] <arschmitz> align on a div is not valid html any more
[14:58:58] <apsdehal> Yeah, saw, align is not valid in html5 anymore
[14:59:17] <apsdehal> They specifically need to set styles
[15:02:37] <arschmitz> yup
[15:04:26] <arschmitz> FWIW though its because controlgroups are display block
[15:04:44] <arschmitz> so its 100% width and is centered
[15:05:04] <arschmitz> if they want the controlgroup inline-block they can set it as such and it will center
[15:05:30] <apsdehal> Great, I will look up on rest of the new issues open
[15:12:20] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Anything else to discuss?
[15:18:42] <cogwurx> can't recall if I have anything, so I'm good
[15:20:33] <apsdehal> I am good too
