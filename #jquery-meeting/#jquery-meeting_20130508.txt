[08:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf_: jzaefferer kborchers petersendidit rxaviers
[08:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> Meeting in a few minutes.
[08:58:39] <kborchers> hey
[08:59:02] <kborchers> for the record, chorded buttons are FUN </sarcasm>
[09:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's get started.
[09:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers sent 2 pull requests to address the inconsistencies we talked about last week.
[09:02:30] <petersendidit> hey
[09:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/981 splits the size, pull, and scale effects into their own files.
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> The PR looks good to me, but I want to get a few more eyes on this before we land it.
[09:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> Just to make sure we're not overlooking something.
[09:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/982 moves the effects demos into the effect directory.
[09:03:31] <scott_gonzalez> The idea seems good, but as is, it will break jqueryui.com
[09:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> So we need to figure out how we want to change jqueryui.com to handle this change.
[09:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> I think we probably want the sidebar to stay as is.
[09:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> Do people agree with that or are there changes we should make to the sidebar?
[09:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll_phone: Are you able to see the logs?
[09:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> I can repost the last question (the only important thing so far)
[09:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[09:06:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so i don't have to look back at how it works, can you summarize how it will break jqueryui.com?
[09:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> The demo iframes are inserted during rendering, and the path to the demo is determined by the page's URL.
[09:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> We can easily change this, but it creates an inconsistency in the site, so we just need to write more code.
[09:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> Which is fine.
[09:09:28] <kborchers> yeah, i think the sidebar should not change so i would be on board with the change to the demo insertion
[09:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so if the sidebar doesn't change, this is where things get tricky...
[09:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> If you look at a normal page: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[09:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> The demos are listed on the right.
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> And demo navigation is ajax'd, with a hash to indicate the demo.
[09:11:20] <kborchers> ok
[09:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> But with effects, you'd end up on a page like http://jqueryui.com/addClass/
[09:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> And all the effects demos would be on the right.
[09:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> And it would basically match the effects nav in the sidebar.
[09:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> And it wouldn't really make sense to use ajax + hash for the demos.
[09:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> Because you'd end up on a page like /addClass/#toggle
[09:12:37] <kborchers> hmmm
[09:14:11] <kborchers> would it be possible to just remove the right nav for all but effect?
[09:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> You mean remove the right nav just for effects?
[09:15:59] <kborchers> yes, but keep it for effect since it seems like the only one with 2 examples, right?
[09:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, effect vs. effects makes this discussion hard :-P
[09:16:49] <kborchers> yeah
[09:17:11] <kborchers> or just combine the default and easing demos for effect and then remove the right nav for all effects
[09:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like there has to be some better way to handle this.
[09:18:25] <kborchers> another not so great idea
[09:19:14] <kborchers> move everything under /effects and ajax nav it on the left and right so basically you just have identical navs /effects/#addClass etc
[09:19:27] <kborchers> not sure if even possible
[09:19:31] <kborchers> just throwing ideas out
[09:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty much everything is possible :-)
[09:20:09] <kborchers> s/possible/sane
[09:20:14] <kborchers> :)
[09:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> Though changing the sidebar to use a hash would mean bad SEO.
[09:20:31] * rxaviers is here
[09:20:37] <kborchers> true
[09:21:10] <rxaviers> (missed the time today)
[09:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The goal here is just to get the demo files into a single directory for download builder to avoid a conditional, right?
[09:22:40] <rxaviers> correct
[09:23:53] <rxaviers> I can check which changes we need to do in jqueryui in order to leave the sidebar as it is today with the unification change.
[09:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> The sidebar isn't the problem.
[09:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's the demo list on the right.
[09:24:41] <DaveStein> bah almost messed up my timezones
[09:24:53] <kborchers> actually the problem is your change rxaviers :P
[09:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, well, the problem is that effects have always deviated from our standards.
[09:25:41] <rxaviers> eheh
[09:25:45] <kborchers> i blame gnarf_
[09:25:47] <kborchers> ;)
[09:25:59] <DaveStein> scott_gonzalez: I think I figured out why my draggable scrolling tests are failing.. so close. I think it's becuase there is a scrollbar and the draggable is starting off screen. I'm thinking my math doesnt account for it. the last I checked, I saw that the scrollLeft doesn't even hit 0
[09:26:06] <gnarf_> what?
[09:26:12] <gnarf> it was worse before I came around
[09:26:15] <gnarf> but now you can blame mike :)
[09:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> DaveStein: Please wait until we're talking about interactions.
[09:26:30] <DaveStein> kk
[09:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> What if we add Easings to the sidebar?
[09:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> Then we list all the effects demos on the right and kill the ajax nav just for effects.
[09:28:02] <kborchers> hmmm, i could maybe go for that
[09:28:25] <kborchers> seems more sane than my suggestions anyway
[09:28:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well if nobody has any objections to that, I'll see if I can get that working.
[09:28:50] <kborchers> gnarf: i just have to give you crap because you're moving away from me :(
[09:29:29] <rxaviers> seems cool to me too
[09:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll look into this today.
[09:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: I know there are a few outstanding TODOs for the classes option that are really design considerations for specific widgets.
[09:30:42] <petersendidit> yea
[09:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> Is there anything else left for it, or are you just waiting for a review at this point?
[09:31:13] <rxaviers> yeap, I just wanted to know if we're sticking with that
[09:31:22] <petersendidit> Waiting for review and solving the weird places that _classes can't work right now
[09:31:36] <rxaviers> no need to code review.. I can proceed just fine knowing it'll be structured that way
[09:31:40] <rxaviers> for*
[09:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll review (hopefully) this week.
[09:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll start looking into the widget-specific design issues.
[09:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> I know at least the menu one will have a huge ripple.
[09:32:30] <rxaviers> ops.. that wasnt for me right ..
[09:32:30] <scott_gonzalez> Because I'd like to just rip out the use of anchors.
[09:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: :-P
[09:32:39] <rxaviers> :)
[09:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, DaveStein, you're up :-)
[09:33:07] <DaveStein> ha ok
[09:33:12] <DaveStein> well i was going nuts with those unit tests
[09:33:28] <DaveStein> took me 10 years to figure out that i needed to enforce the scrollbar which is why it would pass when i reran - cause there was no scrollbar
[09:33:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: good luck … we had that discussion before and i think ripping out the anchors will not be fun
[09:33:46] <DaveStein> but i think my widget is failing since its doing a simulate on a drag out of the viewport with the viewport magically being scrolled over by 100
[09:33:58] <DaveStein> if that's the case, is that a legit bug
[09:34:09] <DaveStein> or should i move the draggable into viewport before running the testdrag?
[09:34:29] <DaveStein> because the actual condition of relative parent yada yada works in the browser when im being a human :)
[09:34:48] <scott_gonzalez> The draggable should be in the viewport. Otherwise you're testing an impossible situation.
[09:35:04] <DaveStein> exactly okay im gonna take care of that then
[09:35:23] <DaveStein> cause its not 100% impossible if youre using simulate
[09:35:24] <DaveStein> :p
[09:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for interactions
[09:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[09:35:53] <DaveStein> and then the testScroll funciton takes a position and is always modifying #main, even for times i don't think the unit test cares/expects it to
[09:35:58] <DaveStein> is that a bug or a feature? :)
[09:36:20] <DaveStein> in the draggable test helpers
[09:36:25] <DaveStein> i just thought it was odd wheni was debugging
[09:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't looked at how the tests are written yet.
[09:37:31] <DaveStein> ill leave as-is for now
[09:37:51] <DaveStein> and on a sidenote, have you been in touch with ngsilverman about sortable lately? just curious how thats coming along
[09:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:38:22] <DaveStein> kk i think thats it then
[09:38:23] <scott_gonzalez> At this point, my interaction concerns are really on the pointer events polyfill.
[09:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> Which brings us to kborchers...
[09:38:50] <kborchers> CHORDED BUTTONS
[09:38:55] <DaveStein> i shoulda done that instead of unit tests cause now he gets the fun part ;)
[09:39:15] <DaveStein> damn you kborchers
[09:39:38] <kborchers> DaveStein: not sure fun is the right word now … it started that way … now i just get to find bugs in MSPointer and wrestle with chorded buttons :)
[09:40:01] <kborchers> it's coming along though
[09:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Did you see the new polyfill?
[09:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/Rich-Harris/Points#whats-wrong-with-the-existing-polyfills
[09:40:38] <kborchers> yeah, i started looking at it but i feel it still has a few missing items / shortcuts
[09:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's annoying that everyone is starting from scratch instead of collaborating.
[09:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> At least we're working with MS.
[09:41:11] <kborchers> i could have pushed what i have and said, "Oh, BTW these features don't work yet" but would rather not do that
[09:41:14] <kborchers> right
[09:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> They should be giving us some feedback in a few days.
[09:41:22] <kborchers> have they been looking at what i'm doing?
[09:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:41:33] <kborchers> ok good … would really like their feedback
[09:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> We asked them to do a review and come up with pros/cons and feedback.
[09:41:47] <kborchers> cool
[09:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> If a special event turns out to be a better approach than hand.js, they're willing to help with it.
[09:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> But, as I've said a million times, I'd much rather find out that hand.js will work for us.
[09:42:52] <kborchers> that would be cool … or if they can take what i've done and make hand better i'd be willing to jump in on that
[09:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> If hand.js does turn out to be our option, maybe we can get the tool kitchen guys to merge and get support from Google too.
[09:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> If we do go with hand.js, I think they're going to move it to GitHub :-)
[09:43:56] <kborchers> that would be a very good thing
[09:44:12] <kborchers> and getting support from google would be very good too … and then there was apple :/
[09:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of moving code to GitHub... I need to work with DaveMethvin to get the TTWF tests into the new repo.
[09:44:27] <kborchers> oh, about those tests
[09:44:36] <kborchers> one thing i've noticed
[09:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> We're moving away from mercurial :-) https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/pointerevents
[09:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard back about who has commit access.
[09:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> I submitted a PR for the jQuery submission that's in mercurial: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/107
[09:45:18] <kborchers> is it not normal to somehow indicate what the expected "passing" result of a set of tests should be?
[09:45:26] <kborchers> that would be really nice
[09:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see if the test suite supports that.
[09:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> This was my first time using it, and I was going off of previous tests.
[09:46:00] <kborchers> otherwise, if i have something completely broken that runs one passing test, it "looks" good
[09:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you mean like QUnit's expect() ?
[09:46:38] <kborchers> just weird or maybe i'm too used to qunit
[09:46:42] <kborchers> yeah
[09:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it has something like that.
[09:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> But maybe we can add a failing assertion if a flag isn't set.
[09:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> And just set flags for each operation we expect to occur.
[09:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping the WG and see if there's a standard way to do this for W3C tests.
[09:47:57] <kborchers> it's just tough … because i'll have one device say 27 passing tests and another will say 56 passing tests and then i have to figure out, did one not run half of the tests or did the other run them twice :/
[09:48:04] <kborchers> 54
[09:48:07] <kborchers> i suck at math :/
[09:48:14] <kborchers> you get the idea
[09:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for Pointer Events?
[09:49:00] <kborchers> nope just plugging away
[09:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:49:26] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10.3 was released, without too much of a hassle :-)
[09:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid ImageMagick problems still exist.
[09:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's amazing that this isn't a widespread issue.
[09:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> Considering how much investigation rxaviers has done.
[09:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like there should be lots of people having problems with the version of IM that MacPorts uses.
[09:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, I'll start cherry-picking for the 1.9.3 release soon.
[09:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's about it for today.
[09:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:53:32] <DaveStein> that seems like a no... heading to conference center now to knock out these unit tests. hopefully youll have a PR in a bit
[09:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
