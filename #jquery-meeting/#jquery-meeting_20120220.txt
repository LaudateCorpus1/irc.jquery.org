[08:55:32] <DaveMethvin> yay
[08:58:13] <gnarf> hey
[08:59:15] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf!
[08:59:15] <addyosmani> g'day
[08:59:21] <DaveMethvin> hey addy
[08:59:31] <addyosmani> heya Dave
[09:00:02] <DaveMethvin> you are such a popular guy addy, my son was so impressed that I knew you :)
[09:00:09] <gnarf> heh
[09:00:10] <addyosmani> oh psh!
[09:00:28] <DaveMethvin> hey, I'M impressed that I know you! :D
[09:00:31] <addyosmani> I'm barely known, Dave :) Thanks for the email btw!
[09:00:59] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf, are you busy nowadays?
[09:01:43] <gnarf> not really - but I'm also not very productive these days - dealing with some troubles
[09:01:55] <gnarf> talkin with dan about the infra plan tho
[09:01:58] <DaveMethvin> imma try to get the 1.8 work going here, wondered what your time was like
[09:02:04] <DaveMethvin> dan and the infra plan
[09:02:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:02:22] <gnarf> I'm hoping to have time for 1.8 effects
[09:04:43] <DaveMethvin> by contract, we're required to completely break one subsystem per major release :D
[09:04:53] <gnarf> exactly
[09:04:57] <DaveMethvin> it can be sizzle this time if timmywil comes thru
[09:06:11] <DaveMethvin> alriighty then, we have gnarf, addyosmani, who else? Is danheberden here?
[09:06:21] <DaveMethvin> i saw rwaldron over in -dev
[09:06:35] <danheberden> DaveMethvin i'm hiding in the shadows, ready to attack
[09:06:38] * kborchers is lurking
[09:07:00] <DaveMethvin> lemme fill in the attendance form
[09:07:02] <gnarf> im actually afk for 5, brb
[09:07:46] <kborchers> lol, love how on the 13th bot-t was marked late
[09:07:58] <DaveMethvin> three lates and we'll eject him
[09:08:39] <DaveMethvin> so just an fyi we've formed our own jQuery Foundation
[09:08:39] <kborchers> he'll eject himself eventually
[09:08:51] <DaveMethvin> separate from the Software Freedom Conservancy
[09:09:06] <DaveMethvin> it was formed on friday, we should have more of announcement soon
[09:09:26] <addyosmani> very cool. Does the goal of the foundation differ hugely from the SFC?
[09:09:35] <DaveMethvin> that gives us more control over taking in and spending money, that's the main thing
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> we don't need to go through SFC for that
[09:09:58] <DaveMethvin> they also charged 5% of our donations for overhead
[09:10:02] <DaveMethvin> which is actually not bad
[09:10:08] <DaveMethvin> but still we can do it ourselves
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> so there's a lot of stuff we are still in the process of figuring out
[09:10:40] <DaveMethvin> but i am sure there will be announcements in the next few weeks with details
[09:10:41] <addyosmani> I can imagine.
[09:10:56] <addyosmani> btw, if anyone at all needs help with 1.8 docs when the time comes, please feel free to reach out.
[09:11:00] <addyosmani> Always happy to assist with that stuff.
[09:11:06] <DaveMethvin> oh we will i can guarantee you
[09:11:37] <addyosmani> \o/
[09:11:50] <DaveMethvin> and also, John has handed over core team lead to me, he's kinda busy with Kahn as you might expect
[09:11:57] <DaveMethvin> so no change
[09:12:09] <DaveMethvin> exept that you will address me as "your highness"
[09:12:11] <addyosmani> Understandable.
[09:12:12] <addyosmani> haha
[09:12:16] <DaveMethvin> especially danheberden
[09:12:24] <gnarf> back
[09:12:49] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: were you able to put together that 1.8 build process? Anything you need from us?
[09:12:51] <addyosmani> I shall refer to you as "your daveness" from hence forth.
[09:12:59] <danheberden> may the cries of a thousand sacrificed virgins find thee, DaveMethvin
[09:13:00] <DaveMethvin> I can create a 1.8 branch if you want
[09:13:12] <danheberden> DaveMethvin no, i haven't yet - soon though!
[09:13:48] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if i do start working on my effects stuff, want me to store it in gnarf37:effects-1.8 or something?
[09:13:59] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: that sounds good
[09:14:23] <DaveMethvin> Okay, i have a list of stuff to be deprecated for discussion, linked in the notes.  http://goo.gl/Vzaxa
[09:14:44] <DaveMethvin> it's for the core/bugs team only at the moment, if you can't get there let me know and I'll add you
[09:15:20] <DaveMethvin> so i want to identify stuff we should deprecate that would help us reduce size and dependencies
[09:15:43] <DaveMethvin> we will probably find other stuff as we go but the sooner we test the waters the better
[09:16:34] <addyosmani> The vast majority of those look sane. Happy to see setData()/getData()/data('events') going away..finally :)
[09:16:45] <DaveMethvin> if you guys can go over that list and think about what should be added or removed, and whether there should be a version for removal specified
[09:16:50] <DaveMethvin> that would be great
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> remembering of course that we need to give a version between deprecation and removal
[09:17:40] <DaveMethvin> so at this point we shouldn't be removing anything from 1.8 that we haven't already announced
[09:18:10] <DaveMethvin> is there anything you guys wanted to discuss?
[09:18:34] <DaveMethvin> Whitney Houston's funeral?
[09:19:19] <DaveMethvin> well in that case i guess we're done
[09:19:20] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: outside of core, but it would be great to get a general idea of roughly when the site refreshes might be targeted for a roll-out
[09:19:31] <addyosmani> Almost no one I've spoken to seems to know.
[09:19:35] <DaveMethvin> that's a good question addyosmani
[09:19:47] <DaveMethvin> i don't think they're far enough into the work to know
[09:19:57] <DaveMethvin> i would guess it might be formally rolled out at our next conf
[09:20:02] <DaveMethvin> which will be ...
[09:20:03] <addyosmani> I ask because we're still working on the learning site, but I know Doug etc also aren't sure how soon their parts need to be wrapped up.
[09:20:12] <addyosmani> in a few months? :)
[09:20:14] <DaveMethvin> June 28-29 i think in SFO
[09:20:21] <DaveMethvin> but not set in stone atm
[09:20:31] <DaveMethvin> SO DON"T TWEET
[09:20:35] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:20:35] <addyosmani> haha.
[09:21:04] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then, see you guys later
[09:21:10] <addyosmani> Later, Dave!
[09:21:14] <gnarf> next conf
[09:21:29] <gnarf> Who's got bugs selected for readings? :)
[09:22:05] <DaveMethvin> i do
