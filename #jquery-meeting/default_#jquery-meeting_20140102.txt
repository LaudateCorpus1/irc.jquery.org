[10:59:16] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[10:59:16] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[10:59:22] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[10:59:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz agcolom RWhitbec- toddmparker
[11:01:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz will probably be here in a minute
[11:01:24] <arschmitz> yeah im here
[11:01:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom is still on vacation
[11:01:30] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:01:58] <uGoMobi> first of all... happy new year everyone!
[11:03:26] <_|Nix|_> Welcome to 2014, all!
[11:03:42] <uGoMobi> here is the link to the weekly meeting doc that we will be using from now on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=sharing
[11:04:20] <_|Nix|_> So, we no longer write in what we've been doing?
[11:04:21] <uGoMobi> you don't have to put updates in there like we did before
[11:04:42] <uGoMobi> not in detail
[11:06:18] <gseguin> Just what's discussed during the meeting, is that right?
[11:07:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, did I interpret this correctly? Topic: <PR number>, Detail: <PR description>, Outcome: Merged/In review/Not applied/Whatever
[11:07:11] <uGoMobi> just put things in there that you are working on that we need to discuss or keep track of progress
[11:07:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[11:07:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'm actually making good progress with the one PR of mine that has caused the most discussion for me ...
[11:08:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what PR is that?
[11:09:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6823
[11:10:02] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:11:31] <uGoMobi> gseguin and arschmitz: any updates about all the things you guys have been working on?
[11:11:58] <gseguin> I think all my PR for the jquery-release process have landed
[11:12:02] <arschmitz> iv just been doing triage and pr review there is a ton since rc thats backed up
[11:12:17] <uGoMobi> yeah I noticed
[11:12:25] <arschmitz> oh and also triaged all the download builder issues
[11:12:30] <gseguin> I have a pending one for using Bower as our dependency management
[11:12:33] <arschmitz> and ported them to jquerymobile.com repo
[11:13:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: we had a plan for directory structure for that im trying to find it to see if it matches
[11:13:16] <gseguin> I have filed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6871
[11:13:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you update the readme.md of jquery-mobile?
[11:13:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[11:13:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we point to the builder issue tracker there
[11:13:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem
[11:13:59] <gseguin> And I've been working on a karma branch
[11:14:26] <gseguin> not related to a ticket though
[11:14:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what is the plan with karma?
[11:15:00] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you just looking into it?
[11:15:15] <gseguin> So, I was looking into it for 2 things
[11:15:24] <gseguin> multi browser testing locally
[11:15:39] <gseguin> code coverage report to coveralls.io
[11:15:59] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:16:02] <gseguin> checkout: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/karma#jquery-mobile--
[11:16:16] <gseguin> that badge, I like
[11:16:24] <uGoMobi> isn't code coverage something the other projects are interested in as well?
[11:16:36] <gseguin> indeed
[11:16:50] <gseguin> and that work could be leveraged
[11:17:17] <gseguin> though it's mostly making our tests work in karma
[11:17:37] <uGoMobi> could be good to mention to them that you are looking into this (if you haven't already)
[11:17:49] <uGoMobi> maybe post in the Google dev group
[11:18:18] <uGoMobi> to see if anyone has input or questions
[11:20:51] <gseguin> Will do once I solve the issue I have right now
[11:21:16] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[11:22:51] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the badge is cool indeed :)
[11:24:12] <_|Nix|_> Oh, nice (the badge)! I actually remember seeing this in other projects.
[11:26:17] <uGoMobi> does what I put in the agenda doc make sense?
[11:27:39] <uGoMobi> I was a bit busy with other work and celebrating holidays
[11:27:53] <gseguin> yes
[11:28:04] <gseguin> it's more minutes than agenda
[11:28:09] <gseguin> but that makes sense
[11:28:40] <uGoMobi> I wanted to to finish the 1.4 upgrade guide but I messed it up a bit so I am still not done with it :(
[11:28:50] <uGoMobi> will finish it asap
[11:29:53] <uGoMobi> anything else you guys want to discuss?
[11:30:32] <arschmitz> i have just one quick thing
[11:30:37] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:30:56] <arschmitz> just want to thank you guys for doing the PR's
[11:31:00] <arschmitz> i know its a pain
[11:31:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Naw, it's actually a good thing.
[11:31:17] <arschmitz> and if you guys are being held up by me on any feel free to ping me
[11:31:18] <_|Nix|_> I'm starting to get used to it.
[11:31:34] <arschmitz> other wise im just kinda working down the list
[11:32:19] <_|Nix|_> Actually there's one thing we should establish: A comment that unambiguously indicates that the PR may be merged.
[11:32:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6821
[11:32:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is it good to go, or did you mean for me to fix the commits so you can look at it again?
[11:33:24] <gseguin> :+1:
[11:33:40] <arschmitz> sure
[11:33:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So far, I've taken when you say something to the effect of "OK, but please squash" to mean that I may now go ahead and land the PR.
[11:33:57] <arschmitz> yes that was my intention
[11:34:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Then I'll land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6821
[11:34:11] <arschmitz> yup
[11:34:23] <gseguin> :+1: as the "go ahead" comment that is
[11:34:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, that's a nice closure for a PR.
[11:35:07] <uGoMobi> go ahead it is
[11:35:20] <arschmitz> works for me
[11:35:48] <gseguin> no no
[11:36:13] <gseguin> I meant the emoticon you get when you type ":+1:" in github
[11:36:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's what I thought.
[11:36:35] <uGoMobi> oh, sorry
[11:36:38] <_|Nix|_> I agree. The emoticon would be a nice closure.
[11:36:41] <gseguin> looks like there was confusion though
[11:37:38] <arschmitz> that works too
[11:39:04] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:39:17] <uGoMobi> looks like we can wrap up here
[11:39:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I thought periods at the end of the long description were OK, just not the short (72 char) description. No?
[11:40:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats correct
[11:40:57] <uGoMobi> thanks all
[11:40:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Just checking.
[11:41:04] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:41:11] <_|Nix|_> Welcome to another exciting jQM year :)
[11:41:20] <uGoMobi> yayy
[11:41:33] <gseguin> see ya
