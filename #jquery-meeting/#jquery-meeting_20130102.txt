[09:00:20] <kborchers> yo
[09:00:22] <rworth> hey
[09:00:54] <petersendidit> hey
[09:01:38] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer has a PR to get us on to grunt 0.4 :-)
[09:02:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/867
[09:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> I just need to run through the release script and make sure everything is working properly.
[09:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be doing that this week.
[09:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> Our site repos will stay on 0.3 for a bit longer.
[09:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> Just because upgrading grunt-wordpress and grunt-jquery-content will take some time.
[09:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think mikesherov is around right now, so we'll come back to mergeatron.
[09:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've got jqueryui.com and api.jqueryui.com updated to new-css.
[09:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers is working on updating the TR styling to work with new-css.
[09:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm in the middle of updating blog.jqueryui.com (huge pain since it doesn't use web-base-template).
[09:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> On a related note, I've also updated qunitjs.com, api.qunitjs.com, api.jquery.com, api.jquerymobile.com, jquery.org.
[09:06:40] <rworth> caus you rock
[09:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano and I are trying to get the sites ready for a launch very soon.
[09:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano was able to redo the All Projects menu and create a new icon sprite.
[09:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> So we're getting close.
[09:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to see the site, you'll need to deploy locally though.
[09:07:26] <ajpiano> oh yeah, that reminds me scott_gonzalez
[09:07:41] <ajpiano> what do you think of the border on the *existing* stage sites
[09:07:47] <ajpiano> cause i basically did the same border as was already there
[09:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I think those are fine, but the difference is that there's a 1px border on the nav on stage/production.
[09:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know if that was intentionally removed or not.
[09:08:36] <ajpiano> ohhh, on the top of the content area
[09:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> But without it, the border on the icon looks out of place.
[09:08:39] <ajpiano> that is exactly what it is
[09:08:41] <ajpiano> good call
[09:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> :--)
[09:09:01] <ajpiano> i also felt it was kind of out of place but didn't have my finger on it, i'll get that in
[09:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:09:15] <ajpiano> oh also btw guys, i put the sprite in the jquery dropbox
[09:09:26] <ajpiano> we should probably figure out a better place, or at least a gree on a place
[09:09:32] <ajpiano> for us to store PSDs and AIs, etc
[09:09:44] <rworth> brand. ?
[09:10:01] <ajpiano> i don't want to have like really heavy binary assets in any of the content repos if we can avoid it
[09:10:03] <rworth> that's where I started putting comps publicly
[09:10:09] <ajpiano> right, comps
[09:10:22] <rworth> not sure of a better way to share stuff like that publicly
[09:10:26] <ajpiano> but i'm talking bout PSD/EPS/AI things that typically one doesn't store in git
[09:10:27] <ajpiano> true
[09:10:40] <ajpiano> maybe a separate repo?
[09:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> We can create a new repo for assets if we want.
[09:10:51] <ajpiano> +1
[09:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-ass ?
[09:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:11:01] <rworth> haha
[09:11:02] <ajpiano> loooooooo
[09:11:28] <ajpiano> jquery-raw-assets?
[09:11:38] <rworth> brand-assets ?
[09:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> Let's bikeshed that repo name later :-)
[09:12:02] <ajpiano> yeah, we don't need jquery in there
[09:12:03] <ajpiano> k
[09:12:06] <rworth> :)
[09:12:20] <ajpiano> speaking of bikeshedding repo names, we are sticking with web-base-template for better or worse, right?
[09:12:30] <rworth> now's the time to change it
[09:12:39] <ajpiano> my thoughts exactly
[09:12:41] <ajpiano> but i donno if we should bother
[09:12:43] <rworth> and I'd be for picking a *much* better name
[09:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-wordpress?
[09:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> jqwptheme
[09:13:21] <rworth> jquery-wordpress
[09:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh good, because jqwptheme was a joke.
[09:13:59] <rworth> jquery-wp-content
[09:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> I still need to go through the dialog test suite.
[09:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> And we're still not sure what to do about progressbar.
[09:14:20] <ajpiano> we can bikeshed this during the content meeting and let you guys get back to UI
[09:14:24] <rworth> sounds good
[09:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> I think maybe we'll just release with what we have for progressbar.
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> If we find a way to get indeterminate progressbars working everywhere, we can also fix in a point release.
[09:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket triage is still going well.
[09:16:17] <scott_gonzalez> 372 open tickets, which is down from the last meeting.
[09:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> Has anyone seen blanket.js?
[09:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> http://migrii.github.com/blanket/
[09:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> It does code coverage and hooks into QUnit.
[09:17:24] <tj_vantoll_phone> Interesting.
[09:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> I did a quick test with it and it caused some test failures :-/
[09:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> But I haven't dug in to what's going on yet.
[09:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> I just heard about it this morning.
[09:18:30] <tj_vantoll_phone> Neat idea at least.
[09:18:37] <kborchers> looks promising … need to play with that
[09:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> I guess there's not much else to discuss if mikesherov isn't around.
[09:22:48] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything they wanted to talk about?
[09:25:37] <mikesherov> Hi
[09:25:55] <mikesherov> Just got out if the shower. I'm on vaca this week
[09:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> Hey mikesherov! Just in time...
[09:26:13] <mikesherov> I was just thinking about blanket.js
[09:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> Have you used it?
[09:26:56] <mikesherov> No
[09:27:01] <mikesherov> Buggy, right?
[09:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> It caused some failures for me when I added it.
[09:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> I also got an error when I tried to click on the results.
[09:27:37] <mikesherov> Yeah. I think it does some not safe transformations
[09:27:46] <mikesherov> Lets hold off for now
[09:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:28:12] <mikesherov> But keep an eye on it
[09:28:51] <mikesherov> So, I'm on mobile... What am I supposed to be discussing today?
[09:29:03] <scott_gonzalez> Petro did a POC of clip, right?
[09:29:08] <mikesherov> Yes
[09:29:12] <mikesherov> Works well
[09:29:32] <mikesherov> Uses an object to store the clip cords
[09:29:50] <mikesherov> And animates the object with a step function to set css
[09:29:52] <scott_gonzalez> So should we move forward on updating all effects?
[09:30:13] <mikesherov> Let me ping him
[09:30:35] <mikesherov> There was 1 bug in WebKit regarding gCS value when clip is auto
[09:30:42] <mikesherov> But there's a workaround
[09:31:04] <mikesherov> The only other thing is that no matter what, there's still an effect on the DOM
[09:31:23] <mikesherov> positional selectors like :first or :last get thrown off
[09:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> Only if the element isn't already absolute/fixed, right?
[09:31:45] <mikesherov> Because it still needs a placeholder.
[09:31:58] <mikesherov> Good point. Not sure if he's checking for that.
[09:32:41] <mikesherov> I'll ping him about both
[09:33:25] <mikesherov> He's coming
[09:34:33] <mikesherov> He also had other improvements he wanted to make
[09:34:41] <mikesherov> I told him to ping you scott_gonzalez
[09:34:51] <mikesherov> He was away last week though.
[09:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember if you were around when we discussed http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8914 last time.
[09:35:55] <mikesherov> I hate backgroundColor
[09:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> Seems to me like jquery-color needs to be changed.
[09:36:07] <mikesherov> K
[09:36:16] <mikesherov> Assign it to me
[09:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok
[09:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like this to be fixed for 1.10.0.
[09:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> I believe it's the only regression left.
[09:37:45] <mikesherov> K
[09:37:56] <mikesherov> It'll happen today
[09:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> Did you want to schedule a PR review meeting?
[09:38:54] <mikesherov> Sure
[09:39:19] <mikesherov> List is manageable at the moment. But when can you do one?
[09:39:34] <mikesherov> I'm open today before 7:30 and all day tomorrow
[09:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...tomorrow we might be able to do one in person.
[09:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> We're driving to NY in the morning.
[09:41:25] <mikesherov> Where in NY?
[09:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> Roslyn Heights
[09:41:45] <mikesherov> Oh awesome.
[09:41:51] <mikesherov> I'm in plainview
[09:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably meet when I get there. Let me check with Kristin.
[09:43:07] <mikesherov> K. Let me know
[09:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> She's laying on the couch with a migraine :-/
[09:44:34] <petro> hey guys
[09:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll give you a call when we get to NY.
[09:44:42] <mikesherov> Ugh
[09:44:42] <mikesherov> petro: Hey
[09:44:49] <mikesherov> K
[09:45:19] <mikesherov> petro: We were talking effects clip
[09:45:27] <petro> ah cool
[09:45:35] <mikesherov> Couple of questions:
[09:46:13] <mikesherov> 1. When the elem is already abspos, it shouldn't create a helper. Does it?
[09:47:21] <petro> nope, only if it's static or relative
[09:47:26] <mikesherov> K
[09:48:08] <mikesherov> 2: are you at a place where you'd say its safe to apply this technique to other effects?
[09:48:31] <mikesherov> Also, I remember you saying it can't cover every effect, only some...
[09:49:31] <petro> it's almost at a place where it can be applied to other effects; i may need to abstract some of the clip animation functionality further to do so, however
[09:50:12] <mikesherov> K. Can you link scott_gonzalez to your compare view branch?
[09:50:19] <petro> well, some effects don't really involve clipping, but any that do should, in theory, be able to use this new clip animation
[09:50:27] <petro> sure, let me push real quick
[09:51:27] <mikesherov> Ok, so this can be used for any clipping effect, and then we'll see how many wrapper based anims exist after theyre all updated?
[09:52:24] <petro> sounds like a good approach
[09:53:02] <petro> https://github.com/mpetrovich/jquery-ui/compare/clip
[09:53:26] <petro> it's not optimized and still has a few bugs, but the approach is there
[09:53:29] <mikesherov> K. So scott_gonzalez can you review that ^
[09:53:50] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:54:11] <mikesherov> Ok, scott_gonzalez does it make sense to make this one of those code review pull requests?
[09:54:39] <mikesherov> petro: You can open a pull, and list current issues in the pull, etc.
[09:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:54:51] <petro> even though it's not quite ready for pull?
[09:55:08] <petro> needs another hour or two of work
[09:55:18] <petro> + testing
[09:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can track that work in the PR.
[09:55:23] <mikesherov> Yeah, so we can track your progress :)
[09:55:33] <petro> gotcha, makes sense :)
[09:55:33] <mikesherov> Jinx
[09:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:55:49] <mikesherov> So, before I forget, one issue: positional css
[09:56:04] <mikesherov> Consider .class:last
[09:56:27] <petro> that's one of the worrisome edge cases
[09:56:36] <mikesherov> No approach avoids at least SOME css issue
[09:57:06] <petro> .class:last is less risky than wrapping, IMO
[09:57:08] <mikesherov> I think we can just brute force copy css for the duration of the anim
[09:57:10] <b-ot> petro, memorised “class:last”.
[09:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh b-ot, you crack me up.
[09:57:39] <mikesherov> ?woah
[09:57:39] <bot-t> Mind Blown Conspiracy Keanu: http://troll.me/2011/12/20/conspiracy-keanu/mind-blown-4/
[09:58:30] <petro> lol
[09:58:52] <petro> gotta run to a meeting in 2min. Should I open a PR for this as-is?
[09:59:11] <mikesherov> we can do: var oldcss=gCS(elem, null).cssText; elem.style.cssText = oldcss;
[09:59:20] <mikesherov> And then remove afterwards
[09:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:59:31] <mikesherov> petro: Yes
[09:59:47] <petro> instead of $.effects.save(el, props) ?
[10:00:00] <mikesherov> Oh, right
[10:00:15] <mikesherov> Props is all props though :)
[10:00:36] <mikesherov> Anyway, open pull and we'll list issues.
[10:00:40] <mikesherov> Thanks petro
[10:01:16] <petro> will do
[10:01:20] <petro> see you gents later
[10:01:51] <mikesherov> Later
[10:02:11] <mikesherov> Brb in 1 sec
[10:02:58] <mikesherov> back
[10:03:18] <petro> mikesherov, scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/876
[10:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks petro
[10:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's it for today.
[10:08:30] <mikesherov> OK, one last thing
[10:09:04] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein is almost "done" with draggable. We should also see if we can squeeze another call in to discuss more of the interactions API upgrades
[10:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to do a review of draggable first.
[10:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't reviewed any of his commits in a while since I've been focused on sites.
[10:10:32] <mikesherov> ok, fair enough
[10:12:19] <mikesherov> OK, scott_gonzalez speak to you tomorrow hopefully!
[10:12:20] <mikesherov> later
[10:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> yup, later
