[11:02:03] <_nickel> I think that's it
[11:02:04] <_nickel> not sure
[11:03:00] <_nickel> toddmparker_: are you joining us?
[11:03:09] <toddparker> hey all
[11:03:14] <gseguin> come have fun with the reindeers
[11:03:30] <toddparker> So the team is doing a parallel video hangout in the link above
[11:03:57] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:10:13] <toddparker> so summarize our branch strategy
[11:10:54] <toddparker> we'll work in master which is 1.next
[11:11:12] <toddparker> 1.0-stable is for maintenance releases (1.0.1)

[11:18:07] <toddparker> fixed: positioning is going well
[11:18:08] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3216
[11:18:08] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #3216 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1w, 3d ago): Switch fixed toolbars to CSS position:fixed
[11:25:54] <toddparker> making good progress, going to put up a branch tomorrow
[11:26:01] <toddparker> scott is working on this
[11:26:27] <toddparker> fetch links, popup and dialog refactor branches soon - mat is on that
[11:26:41] <toddparker> AMD progress from gseguin for dependency management
[11:26:50] <toddparker> define what module we depend on
[11:27:02] <toddparker> all plugins are wrapped now
[11:27:23] <toddparker> build file has been updated to work with this, closure compiler too
[11:27:32] <toddparker> AMD branch is up
[11:27:44] <toddparker> loads all files async
[11:28:04] <toddparker> don't need php combiner anymore
[11:28:13] <toddparker> require.js now does this
[11:28:40] <toddparker> build strips out the defines so it looks like before
[11:28:52] <toddparker> but we get the dependency management
[11:43:16] <toddparker> need to figure out how to deal with css
[12:44:29] <toddparker> thanks all!
