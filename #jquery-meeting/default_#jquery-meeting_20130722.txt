[09:00:31] <DaveMethvin> oh boy
[09:01:52] <DaveMethvin> orkel m_gol timmywil rwaldron gnarf mikesherov jaubourg gibson042 meeting time!
[09:02:05] <DaveMethvin> i made u an agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:02:06] <timmywil> yay!
[09:02:22] <orkel> hey-hey
[09:03:03] <DaveMethvin> we'll give the slackers a couple of minutes
[09:05:13] <DaveMethvin> okay, let's roll!
[09:05:13] <m_gol> hi
[09:05:27] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol
[09:05:44] <DaveMethvin> so it's summer time and the living is easy
[09:05:58] <DaveMethvin> our unit tests are kinda almost running
[09:06:12] <DaveMethvin> looks like there's a recent issue with the "order" patch
[09:06:21] <DaveMethvin> on browsers that don't support "order" css
[09:06:34] <DaveMethvin> they are returning undefined which makes sense
[09:06:59] <m_gol> hard to test sth like that
[09:07:13] <DaveMethvin> i am thinking we can change the test to allow either `undefined` or just make sure it doesn't have `px` at the end
[09:07:20] <m_gol> we'd have to first check if a browser supports order prefixed
[09:07:29] <DaveMethvin> not ideal but hey, it will pass :)
[09:07:43] <DaveMethvin> we auto-check them tho right?
[09:08:05] <DaveMethvin> and i don't think anyone will intro it with a prefix in the future
[09:08:28] <m_gol> or maybe just check first if a browser supports -webkit-order or order
[09:08:44] <m_gol> there's also -ms-flex-order, what do we do about it?
[09:08:51] <m_gol> it's from the middle stage of the spec, around 2011
[09:09:00] <m_gol> it's in IE10
[09:09:03] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i'd make people do that one themselves
[09:09:10] <DaveMethvin> since it's a vendor specific thing
[09:09:10] <m_gol> k, that makes sense
[09:09:14] <m_gol> since behavior is different
[09:09:26] <m_gol> so we'd only have to check -webkit-order & order
[09:09:36] <DaveMethvin> all we need the test to do is ensure that the result does not have "px" at the end of what it returns
[09:09:41] <m_gol> and if any of those 2 is supported, we could do the test
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> we're not really caring (in that test) what else it does
[09:09:47] <m_gol> otherwise we'd check for undefined
[09:10:30] <DaveMethvin> String(undefined) doesn't end in "px"  :D
[09:10:30] <m_gol> as for introing with prefixes, WebKit still plans to use prefixes
[09:10:35] <m_gol> lol
[09:10:56] <DaveMethvin> oh i guess that's true, Safari guys
[09:11:03] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think they're going to do a lot
[09:11:12] <m_gol> Blink & Mozilla don't, the same goes for Opera as it's Blink, dunno about IE
[09:11:32] <DaveMethvin> seems like just about all the other WebKit guys are going with Blink
[09:11:38] <DaveMethvin> except for Safari
[09:11:54] <m_gol> well, if one wants to embed an engine, Blink might be harder to do it
[09:11:58] <m_gol> e.g. PhantomJS
[09:12:17] <m_gol> otherwise IIRC you have to take full Chromium
[09:12:20] <DaveMethvin> i just wonder how much is going to get done on WK now that Google is out
[09:12:43] <m_gol> Adobe plans to submit patches to both WebKit & Blink
[09:12:55] <DaveMethvin> Google seemed like 80% of what was getting done
[09:13:07] <m_gol> yeah
[09:13:13] <DaveMethvin> m_gol can you come up with a fix for that unit test?
[09:13:14] <m_gol> we're getting a little OT ;)
[09:13:20] <m_gol> ok, no problem
[09:13:28] <DaveMethvin> make up something good :)
[09:13:39] <m_gol> ;)
[09:13:47] <DaveMethvin> on the ajax tests
[09:14:07] <DaveMethvin> dunno why they are hanging
[09:14:22] <DaveMethvin> i guess i need to check with jzaefferer gnarf or Krinkle|detached on that
[09:14:40] <DaveMethvin> the server was supposedly fixed to allow POST to html files
[09:14:51] <DaveMethvin> but maybe it's still an issue and we should just change that
[09:15:01] <orkel> it was, it seems there is another problem
[09:16:05] <orkel> it looks like temporary issue with the server, because for me ajax tests are passing in jenkins
[09:16:11] <DaveMethvin> oh, ok
[09:16:14] <DaveMethvin> good!
[09:16:36] <orkel> but we still have to update browsers in testswarm
[09:16:54] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah  i noticed and forgot that
[09:17:09] <orkel> we test in chrome 25, whereas current version is 28 :-(
[09:17:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah we're a bit out of date!
[09:17:22] <orkel> i could talk we Krinkle about that
[09:17:37] <DaveMethvin> thanks orkel
[09:17:45] <orkel> i mean i already did, but he must have forgot about that
[09:18:23] <DaveMethvin> i forget, are the versions hard coded into the browser set files?
[09:19:09] <orkel> mm, dunno :-), we have to check with Timmo
[09:19:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah np
[09:19:54] <DaveMethvin> alright, next item
[09:20:04] <DaveMethvin> How's everything coming on AMD timmywil
[09:20:56] <DaveMethvin> let's move on and we can catch up on that later
[09:21:01] <timmywil> it needs more work, but I'll be pushing a branch to the jQuery repo soon
[09:21:04] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:21:46] <DaveMethvin> that next one is from paul_irish, about the forced layouts
[09:21:56] <paul_irish> yes. so i bump into this a lot
[09:22:11] <paul_irish> but just a second ago i tested the latest build ... and things look pretty good there.
[09:22:16] <paul_irish> so i'll have to dig in more
[09:22:23] <DaveMethvin> we fixed a bunch of things in 1.8 that did more forcing
[09:22:36] <DaveMethvin> but i also cced you on that other ticket about layout on event handling
[09:22:38] <m_gol> we still have a few unnecessary tests, though, I think
[09:22:41] <m_gol> at least in 2.x
[09:22:43] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:22:51] <orkel> m_gol do we?
[09:22:51] <m_gol> we should evaluate if some could be skipped
[09:23:01] <m_gol> the boxSizing test is not necessary in 2.x
[09:23:09] <DaveMethvin> i'd esp like to have the modules do their own tests and try to make them lazy
[09:23:16] <m_gol> yup
[09:23:18] <DaveMethvin> and you know the boxSizing causes layout :)
[09:23:31] <m_gol> how are we staying on eliminating public access to jQuery.support?
[09:23:42] <DaveMethvin> altho it's not very slow, at least on desktops
[09:23:53] <paul_irish> desktops are always fast
[09:23:57] <paul_irish> desktop is easy :)
[09:23:57] <m_gol> ;)
[09:24:05] <m_gol> yeah
[09:24:08] <DaveMethvin> well EXCUUUSE me!
[09:24:13] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:24:27] <DaveMethvin> let's just get everyone a desktop, problem solved
[09:24:27] <m_gol> I've seen that iPhone 4S is a little more efficient than IE8
[09:24:31] <paul_irish> hahahaha. :) fast on mobile is just super hard. it's a good challenge.
[09:24:32] <m_gol> :D
[09:24:37] <DaveMethvin> also solves the obesity problem, we will all be lifting weights
[09:24:45] <paul_irish> love it.
[09:25:01] * paul_irish orders larger pockets.
[09:25:06] <m_gol> we just need to add a little change
[09:25:13] <m_gol> fat on mobile -> fast on mobile
[09:25:16] <m_gol> just one letter
[09:25:23] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, simple edit
[09:25:56] <DaveMethvin> so do we need a ticket specifically for this? I'm leaning towards yes although it does overlap with others
[09:26:00] <m_gol> so... I'd love to eliminate jQuery.support
[09:26:11] <m_gol> and at least not add any new properties to it
[09:26:18] <m_gol> and deprecate current ones
[09:26:32] <DaveMethvin> agreed m_gol i think we will break it well enough that nobody will use it :)
[09:27:00] <DaveMethvin> if we do the detects lazily a lot won't be usable exernally since they can't trigger them directly
[09:27:11] <DaveMethvin> if you want to know about offsets you'll need to call .offset() at least once
[09:27:17] <DaveMethvin> which is fine with me
[09:27:48] <DaveMethvin> imma create a new ticket for this and xref the others that are in the same neighborhood
[09:27:57] <m_gol> exposing jQuery.support is the reason we can't just remove support.boxModel in 2.x
[09:28:12] <m_gol> how about just setting it to true and not using it in 2.x?
[09:28:17] <DaveMethvin> at least that one doens't force layout
[09:28:22] <m_gol> while deprecating the whole support access
[09:28:50] <DaveMethvin> we'll need to keep jQuery.support around as an object b/c people add their own stuff to it
[09:28:54] <DaveMethvin> mobile does
[09:28:58] <DaveMethvin> a few plugins do
[09:28:59] <m_gol> ah, ok
[09:29:04] <m_gol> but it could be empty
[09:29:10] <DaveMethvin> that would be ideal :)
[09:29:21] <m_gol> though I suppose we can't just remove every property outright
[09:29:27] <m_gol> we need one version to deprecate, right?
[09:29:45] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.support is "unstable" so we don't need long notice
[09:29:54] <m_gol> ah, great
[09:29:54] <DaveMethvin> we can change stuff from version to version
[09:30:12] <m_gol> k, so we could just remove it
[09:30:25] <DaveMethvin> for that i think the existing ticket 10814 can hold our jQuery.support changes
[09:30:26] <m_gol> I mean, replace with an empty object ;)
[09:30:40] <m_gol> true
[09:30:56] <m_gol> I'll check if we have any other useless test in 2.x
[09:31:10] <DaveMethvin> great, you want to grab 10814 then?
[09:31:17] <m_gol> yeah, sure
[09:31:23] <DaveMethvin> atm it's closed but we can just reuse it
[09:31:25] <m_gol> but I need an AMD build first, right?
[09:31:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:31:47] <m_gol> and it's for 2.1
[09:31:54] <DaveMethvin> orkel, anything on that list you see that you'd like to work on?
[09:31:57] <m_gol> so the question is, when do we branch
[09:32:08] <m_gol> 2.0-stable etc.
[09:32:08] <m_gol> ?
[09:32:11] <orkel> benchmarks!
[09:32:14] <m_gol> :)
[09:32:23] <DaveMethvin> i'll bet timmywil would love that!
[09:32:26] <orkel> i hate speed folder
[09:32:33] <DaveMethvin> please, delete that thing!
[09:32:41] <orkel> I was thinking it could be done as grunt task
[09:32:44] <timmywil> oh yea, that can go now
[09:32:53] <orkel> through phantomjs and if it would look presentable, through sause labs in all supported browsers
[09:33:15] <orkel> I already start working on that, but there is a couple of issues about that.
[09:33:21] <DaveMethvin> have a good time with it orkel, it's got to be better than /speed no matter what
[09:33:22] <m_gol> maybe we could use karma for tests on real browsers?
[09:33:24] <timmywil> orkel: we should start with a page
[09:33:45] <orkel> timmywil ?
[09:34:00] <DaveMethvin> oh just a test page for perf?
[09:34:08] <DaveMethvin> kinda like a qunit page?
[09:34:22] <orkel> oh, yes, kinda like that
[09:34:25] <timmywil> yes
[09:34:32] <timmywil> but it should run in any browser
[09:34:39] <m_gol> why not, it'd be easier to run :)
[09:35:08] <timmywil> phantomjs isn't actually a real perf target, even though it's convenient
[09:35:18] <DaveMethvin> true dat
[09:35:37] <DaveMethvin> i wish phantomjs would use a more up to date engine
[09:35:57] <m_gol> I reassigned http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10814 to myself, though I'll need to wait for timmywil's AMD build
[09:36:01] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:36:12] <orkel> at the first it might work only in phantomjs and if it would look okey, then we should run it in all browsers but automatically
[09:36:26] <timmywil> yup, I'll be working on that this week
[09:36:29] <DaveMethvin> i'll create a ticket for the deferred/callback work, which also will wait for amd
[09:36:46] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I could probably fold that into what I'm doing
[09:36:54] <m_gol> so ass soon as timmywil's AMD branch is ready we should branch for 2.1, right?
[09:37:00] <m_gol> * ass -> as...
[09:37:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah we didn't answer that question m_gol
[09:37:21] <orkel> timmywil: if we do this only as a page, then it might became another speed folder
[09:37:21] <DaveMethvin> does it seem like we'll need another patch release?
[09:37:35] <DaveMethvin> if not we can just work in the 1.x-master and master
[09:37:48] <DaveMethvin> if we DO need a patch, we can branch from any point in history
[09:37:53] <timmywil> orkel: not if we run it in swarm
[09:38:14] <orkel> testswarm will go away soon
[09:38:15] <m_gol> ?14152
[09:38:30] <m_gol> not this channel I guess... http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14152
[09:38:34] <DaveMethvin> so i'd just say we work in master on 2.1/1.11 stuff and branch if we need a patch
[09:38:44] <timmywil> orkel: wait what?
[09:39:20] <orkel> krinkle will deprecate it rewriting testswarm as grunt task
[09:39:40] <DaveMethvin> also i think there was some discussion of moving to saucelabs
[09:39:42] <timmywil> oh, well as long as it runs real browsers
[09:39:47] <DaveMethvin> definitely
[09:40:09] <DaveMethvin> actually, "as long as it runs" it would be better than today :)
[09:40:09] <orkel> timmywil: it will! There is no point to run it only in phantomjs
[09:40:20] <timmywil> i don't care what we use, but our integrated cross-browser tester can also run perf tests to catch regressions
[09:40:43] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: dunno, if we start commiting breaking changes, later patch releases would force us to look up the latest non-breaking commit
[09:40:56] <m_gol> it might be easier to branch now, maybe the branch won't be used, no loss
[09:41:42] <DaveMethvin> we can update the package.json version before starting to land stuff so we'll know where to branch
[09:41:46] <orkel> but as the first step it might work only with phantomjs, another issue with that it could take a long time to run all the perf tests
[09:42:05] <timmywil> orkel: which is another reason why it should be automated
[09:42:24] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ok, that's another solution
[09:42:44] <orkel> timmywil: with what?
[09:43:24] <timmywil> orkel: I'm not sure how I'm confusing you
[09:44:38] <orkel> i mean you want to see a regression through what interface?
[09:44:46] <orkel> testswarm? jenkins?
[09:46:09] <DaveMethvin> well step 1 is to get some benchmarks, but it would definitely be sweet if we could do regular runs similar to our qunit tests that compared the perf and warned if we had regressed
[09:46:45] <timmywil> I'd like to see automated perf tests that run in all our supported browsers on every commit. So, whatever runs the tests can report results.
[09:47:32] <timmywil> I imagine jenkins (or travis if we do that) can trigger the test runner (testswarm or whatever else)
[09:47:49] <orkel> not sure if travis can
[09:48:03] <orkel> okey, i will think how to make this happen
[09:48:15] <DaveMethvin> great!
[09:48:23] <DaveMethvin> so i think we got everything covered
[09:48:29] <orkel> wait sec
[09:48:44] <timmywil> oh someone linked a ticket
[09:48:51] <timmywil> m_gol
[09:49:06] <orkel> if right know we would run tests only in console, what that be okey?
[09:49:21] <DaveMethvin> i think that would be a good start
[09:49:36] <orkel> okey, great
[09:49:51] <DaveMethvin> eventually we will want them all automated like jenkins/swarm is for unit tests
[09:49:58] <DaveMethvin> but one step at a time
[09:50:08] <orkel> right
[09:50:12] <DaveMethvin> if you delete /speed i will be happy :)
[09:50:38] <m_gol> seems like Horse JS quote :P
[09:50:39] <timmywil> yea, writing perf tests will be the time-consuming part
[09:50:52] <orkel> :-), yeah we should open a bottle of champagne on that day
[09:51:22] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure our perf suite will be like our unit test suite, we will add more as we find bottlenecks
[09:51:40] <timmywil> sure
[09:51:41] <DaveMethvin> okay, anything else?
[09:52:01] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you wrote about a couple of unmentioned tickets in agenda
[09:52:26] <DaveMethvin> oh #9628 maybe?
[09:52:36] <m_gol> yup
[09:52:52] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, mikesherov is the owner, but i dunno if he will have time to do that one
[09:53:08] <m_gol> yeah, he has one other big ticket assigned now ;)
[09:53:17] <DaveMethvin> anyone interested in tackling that? m_gol?
[09:53:44] <DaveMethvin> his wife just had twin sons a couple of days  ago
[09:53:56] <m_gol> I can take it though probably not during this week and I'm on vacation 28.07-8.08 so it'd wait a little
[09:54:09] <DaveMethvin> okay, we don't have to decide it today
[09:54:16] <m_gol> but we're not releasing 2.1 in a month I guess ;)
[09:54:22] <DaveMethvin> not likely :)
[09:54:43] <DaveMethvin> i think we want to give people a chance to catch up
[09:55:06] <DaveMethvin> okay, let's call this meeting closed then
[09:55:08] <m_gol> yeah, we don't want a race with Chrome version numbers ;)
[09:55:18] <DaveMethvin> see you in -dev!
