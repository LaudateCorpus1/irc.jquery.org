[13:59:24] <sfrisk> Chassis meeting time
[13:59:44] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit nashvail arschmitz
[14:00:46] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:01:38] <sfrisk> kristyjy can't make it today, I think
[14:03:19] <sfrisk> unless of course I lied, and kristy really is here
[14:03:29] <kristy> I'm here
[14:03:38] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:03:40] <nashvail> me too
[14:04:10] <sfrisk> okay, might be a short meeting then
[14:04:21] <sfrisk> Kristjy, did you get a chance to do those last changes on tables?
[14:04:31] <sfrisk> kristy*
[14:05:26] <kristy> The 4th really messed me up. I'm sorry. I have a free weekend this coming weekend for the first time in like a month so yay
[14:06:12] <kristy> You can come harass me if you want this week too :D
[14:06:56] <sfrisk> okay!
[14:07:19] <sfrisk> *puts note in agenda*
[14:07:48] <sfrisk> Okay, as for inputs, nashvail has been working on some possible designs for the inputs
[14:08:01] <sfrisk> as an alternative to http://view.css-chassis.com/input-styling/demos/inputs.html
[14:08:12] <sfrisk> http://imgur.com/ED9dxaw
[14:08:34] <sfrisk> My notes were to clearly call out label sizes, have a group label for checkbox/inputs, and an error styling for labels
[14:08:42] <nashvail> this one's in full res http://i.imgur.com/ED9dxaw.png
[14:08:44] <sfrisk> the five examples of inputs are slightly different in different ways
[14:08:49] <sfrisk> although I do have old lady eyes
[14:09:17] <sfrisk> I almost want a grey background or something else for "disabled" -- that redish tone makes me think "error"
[14:10:18] <kristy> yeah I agree I liked how the grey background looked on the ones you had last time. All the other new ones I like a lot more though :)
[14:10:46] <nashvail> the color will be fixed, I think I had flux on LOL
[14:12:03] <sfrisk> a particular one you like? I like slight rounded corners over no rounded corners - I think they match with the buttons better
[14:12:21] <sfrisk> with the exception being of a label + button were inline togeter
[14:12:30] <sfrisk> like what we have for button bar
[14:12:34] <sfrisk> but instead input + button
[14:12:39] <sfrisk> like you might see in a search bar
[14:13:14] <sfrisk> http://codepen.io/phantomesse/pen/CrzkA
[14:13:24] <sfrisk> so rounded corner on left input, and right button
[14:13:32] <sfrisk> but flat edges meeting each other
[14:14:04] <nashvail> we can do that in say input-inline-left/right ?
[14:14:06] <sfrisk> similar to what we have with button bars at the bototm: http://view.css-chassis.com/input-styling/demos/buttons.html
[14:14:50] <sfrisk> possiibly, but you want to take into account stuff that is in the center as well
[14:14:51] <kristy> welp I have old lady eyes too because for some reason my eye wanted there to be a slight rounded corner so that's how I saw it :D But yeah what I did like about these are the colors. The dark black in the last version was too much IMO so I like the feel of these more
[14:18:10] <sfrisk> also if you could post the current high res version on the input issue - for example https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/10 or https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/6
[14:18:23] <sfrisk> there are people who watch those issues that aren't necessarily in meetings
[14:18:35] <sfrisk> and then add some of the notes brought up here.  See if we can get more input
[14:18:57] <nashvail> sure
[14:19:49] <nashvail> I will add a comment
[14:20:34] <nashvail> Also if we can finalize the design sooner I can make the required changes in code
[14:21:33] <sfrisk> yeah, update that issue, make the updates we suggested here
[14:21:43] <sfrisk> including adding a few of those examples mentioned
[14:21:54] <sfrisk> and just keep messaging me until I look at it
[14:21:57] <sfrisk> :-)
[14:22:23] <sfrisk> also on that note, I can't make it to next week's meeting, so unless arschmitz can run it, I don't think we can have a meeting next week
[14:22:30] <sfrisk> unless all of you want to run it from #css-chassis
[14:23:54] <nashvail> ok
[14:27:35] <sfrisk> okay, on that note, if no one has anything else...?
[14:30:05] <sfrisk> see everyone in two weeks!
