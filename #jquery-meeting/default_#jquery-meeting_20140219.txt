[09:02:11] <mikesherov_> hi
[09:02:25] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:26] <mikesherov_> I have only a few minutes today
[09:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: gnarf jzaefferer kborchers rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:02:32] <mikesherov_> mind if I give an update real quick?
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:02:37] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:02:38] <arschmitz> hi
[09:02:53] <kborchers> i have to sit this one out but am here if you need me. just mention me
[09:03:09] <mikesherov_> OK, I have effects in a good place. There are tasks listed on the PR. I'd like scott_gonzalez to review with jzaefferer and maybe gnarf
[09:03:28] <mikesherov_> I'm waiting on the IE7, Opera decision before I go testing in those browsers.
[09:03:48] <gnarf> mikesherov_ scott_gonzalez  jzaefferer : if you guys plan to review that together, I'll happily join
[09:03:57] <mikesherov_> There is a test fail in droppable in IE7 which I can ignore as well if we drop IE7
[09:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's pick a time either tomorrow or Friday?
[09:04:08] <mikesherov_> so, that's me this week
[09:04:13] <mikesherov_> friday works
[09:04:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: tomorrow, i'll be on a plane friday
[09:04:30] <gnarf> unless we go for fri later eve
[09:04:39] <gnarf> but if we want to catch jzaefferer i doubt thats possible
[09:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What time works for you tomorrow morning?
[09:05:17] <gnarf> well, considering its 9am now... :)
[09:05:29] <gnarf> i could go for pretty much now or later in time tomorrow
[09:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you're still west coast...
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Does noon tomorrow work for you?
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> noon ET
[09:11:28] <jzaefferer> oh hai
[09:12:28] <jzaefferer> noon ET tomorrow should work
[09:12:35] <jzaefferer> I could also do after the dev leads meeting today
[09:12:49] <jzaefferer> just need some time inbetween somewhere to eat
[09:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Does noon ET tomorrow work for you?
[09:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's move to the next item while we wait for gnarf.
[09:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Anything to discuss for button right now?
[09:17:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah noon ET works tomorrow
[09:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:19:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok...
[09:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Anything to discuss for Globalize?
[09:20:14] <rxaviers> Im working on the number module https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/200
[09:20:44] <jzaefferer> Rafael has been working on DB as well, might want to add that to the agenda
[09:20:44] <arschmitz> nothing really going through open issues and making sure they are all addressed
[09:21:00] <arschmitz> i split out the tests and got them all passing again for button / checkboxradio
[09:21:21] <arschmitz> just one is giving me trouble passes in browsers but not phantom something to do with focus
[09:22:30] <rxaviers> Just want to note that #196 is the PR for the part of date module that handles timezone. The ideia is that the plain timezone support requires no extra dependency. But, the extended timezone support requires a dependency that supports olson timezone, Moment.js-timezone could be one of them.
[09:23:10] <rxaviers> Date module is has been implemented on #172
[09:23:55] <jzaefferer> What's olson timezone?
[09:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> Names for timezones.
[09:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> Like "America/New_York"
[09:25:59] <rxaviers> Correct
[09:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's discuss browser support.
[09:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone object to dropping IE7 and Opera 12.1x immediately?
[09:31:21] <jzaefferer> I think the PR is good to land as-is. We can work on adding devDependencies afterwards
[09:31:27] <jzaefferer> Oh, browser, not bower
[09:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I changed the order :-)
[09:31:40] <jzaefferer> bower comes earlier in the agenda!
[09:32:12] <tj_vantoll> Does that mean pulling out IE7 hacks from the code as well?
[09:32:32] <jzaefferer> Do we have Opera specific hacks anywhere?
[09:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yes
[09:33:02] <tj_vantoll> "support: ie7" appears 13 times in the project
[09:33:14] <jzaefferer> in effect.js we've got // support: Opera, IE <9
[09:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> Though often combined with other browser support.
[09:33:36] <jzaefferer> tooltip.js has // support: IE<9, Opera in jQuery <1.7
[09:33:49] <jzaefferer> so we'd not remove anything opera specific
[09:34:01] <jzaefferer> as long as we still support IE8
[09:34:33] <tj_vantoll> We have "Support: Opera 12.10" in some of draggable's tests.
[09:35:00] <jzaefferer> I haven't looked at tests
[09:35:07] <tj_vantoll> If we're going to do it, 1.11 seems like a decent time to do it. And I'm in favor.
[09:35:09] <jzaefferer> looks like we have a single IE7 specific hack in tabs
[09:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> And it doesn't even work properly!
[09:35:30] <jzaefferer> but getting tests to pass in IE7 is awful, since it has no built-in console etc.
[09:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> That was actually the tipping point for me with IE7.
[09:35:57] <arschmitz> im +1 for dropping ie7 for sure
[09:36:04] <jzaefferer> Did we have anyone ever complain about our lack of support for IE6?
[09:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[09:36:28] <tj_vantoll> If we don't drop it in 1.11 we'll be stuck with it for awhile. And I haven't heard a single IE6 complaint.
[09:36:41] <arschmitz> we had some complaints when we dropped ie7 on mobile
[09:36:46] <arschmitz> but they were very very minor
[09:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> And it was a long time ago, right?
[09:37:00] <arschmitz> 1.3
[09:37:08] <arschmitz> wait no 1.4 actually
[09:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> Really?
[09:37:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> Two months ago and you had complaints?
[09:37:36] <arschmitz> but it was one of the first things we did when we started
[09:37:41] <arschmitz> and the complaints were then
[09:37:49] <arschmitz> so like last march
[09:37:50] <tj_vantoll> Kendo UI still supports IE7 fwiw.
[09:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Do you know if they have plans to drop it?
[09:38:17] <arschmitz> but they were not very vocal and it went no where
[09:38:51] <jzaefferer> so there were complaints a year ago, but not after the actual release?
[09:38:52] <arschmitz> and to us drop of support is a bit more dramatic because they get no js at all
[09:38:56] <tj_vantoll> It'll happen late this year, not sure on specifics. We have kept it around because Kendo UI has a pretty big enterprise market.
[09:39:03] <arschmitz> non since release
[09:40:15] <arschmitz> its such a small share now
[09:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5607 is in the 1.4 changelog :-P
[09:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> http://jquerymobile.com/changelog/1.4.0/ doesn't mention dropping support for IE7.
[09:41:09] <tj_vantoll> http://jquerymobile.com/upgrade-guide/1.4/#supported-platforms
[09:41:09] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:41:19] <arschmitz> weird that issue should not have been its milestone is 1.3.1
[09:42:04] <arschmitz> and i need to add that to the changelong clearly
[09:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Does Kendo UI support Opera 12.1x?
[09:42:36] <tj_vantoll> Nope
[09:42:39] <tj_vantoll> http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/ (scroll to bottom)
[09:42:47] <tj_vantoll> Opera 15+
[09:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, Mobile is IE 10+
[09:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> and no ESR for Firefox?
[09:43:16] <tj_vantoll> It follows the same reasoning as before though, enterprises generally don't use Opera.
[09:44:55] <tj_vantoll> I'm not exactly sure the details on the Firefox support. It doesn't come up often anyways.
[09:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_ put this together: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqG6HhF00MnSdGNYX3NEUjd5ZTE3SFd5WkpPaGdqa3c&usp=drive_web#gid=1
[09:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> more stats from mikesherov_:
[09:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> Opera 12.1 in "Asia": (0.5%) http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-as-weekly-201340-201407
[09:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> Opera 12.1 in "Russian Federation": (5.1%, though dropping at a rate of .1% / week) http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-RU-weekly-201340-201407
[09:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> Opera 12.1 in "Europe": (1.1%) http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-eu-weekly-201340-201407
[09:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> If we drop support today, it won't affect users for at least a month.
[09:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> So we're talking Q2 at the earliest.
[09:46:46] <jzaefferer> Let's do it!
[09:46:52] <tj_vantoll> +1 do it
[09:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> Final chance for objections...
[09:47:14] <jzaefferer> There are no Opera-specific hacks that we'd remove, so its likely that everything will just continue to work
[09:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> Dropping browsers in 5...
[09:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> 4...
[09:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> 3...
[09:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> 2...
[09:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> 1...
[09:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> YAY, no more IE7 or Opera 12.1x support
[09:47:35] <rxaviers> lol
[09:47:42] <arschmitz> hoora!
[09:48:05] <jzaefferer> I'll look into updating our TestSwarm browserSet
[09:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> I think we should updates TestSwarm immediately, but leave our workarounds in place until after 1.11.
[09:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> So we won't officially support them anymore, and we won't land new fixes, but we (hopefully) won't regress until after 1.11.
[09:49:18] <tj_vantoll> That could be a bit odd though, since we could (to the end user) remove support in a bug fix release.
[09:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> In practice that won't happen though.
[09:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> We wouldn't remove them until after we branch 1-11-stable.
[09:49:48] <tj_vantoll> Ah ok.
[09:49:49] <scott_gonzalez> And those wouldn't get cherry-picked.
[09:49:57] <tj_vantoll> I'll make a ticket.
[09:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:52:17] <tj_vantoll> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9838
[09:52:31] <jzaefferer> Afaik jQuery UI is the only project using the popular-no-ie6 set. The name is kinda stupid, I tend to rename that to "popular-ui" and drop IE7 and Opera 12.1 from that
[09:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> Marked as 1.12 blocker.
[09:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:53:22] <jzaefferer> looking at http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2555 - once IE7 and Opera 12.1 are gone, we just need to fix that dialog regression in Chromium-based browsers
[09:53:32] <jzaefferer> then we'd be all green!
[09:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO!
[09:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can try to get the various core versions all green too :-)
[09:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> So, datepicker...
[09:55:07] <scott_gonzalez> Should we move it up to 1.12?
[09:55:15] <scott_gonzalez> Or do we think 1.13 is still an accurate timeframe?
[09:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers has been making great progress on Globalize.
[09:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> So I don't anticipate that being a blocker.
[09:55:59] <rxaviers> :)
[09:56:18] <jzaefferer> Its not encouraging that Dylan didn't like the ARIA implementation.
[09:56:42] <tj_vantoll> I'm going to be attacking datepicker in ~2/3 months when my book is wrapping up. Until then I won't have too much time.
[09:56:46] <rxaviers> It will be so cool to rm -Rf ui/I18n :p
[09:56:47] <tj_vantoll> There's still quite a bit to do.
[09:56:59] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: CONFIRM!
[09:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I think you should get that commit when it's ready :-)
[09:57:22] <jzaefferer> I may be able to work on datepicker mid-March.
[09:57:25] <rxaviers> ahahah
[09:57:33] <rxaviers> I guess it's a good timeframe
[09:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's still plenty of time for 1.12 though.
[09:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get back to more frequent patch releases.
[09:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> I've been scattered all over the place for about a year and UI releases have suffered from that.
[09:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 was too long and 1.10 was too fast.
[09:58:51] <tj_vantoll> The core of the rewrite is solid. I have the vast majority of the test suite converted and running.
[09:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> If we can do 2-3 major releases every year, with about 1 patch release every month, that'd be great.
[09:59:36] <jzaefferer> where 1.x is major in your book, right?
[09:59:43] <arschmitz> thats about the same schedule mobile is trying for too
[10:00:20] <jzaefferer> once you stuff giving out legal advice on twitter or building a bug tracker, I'm sure you can get more done on UI :p
[10:01:07] <jzaefferer> s/stuff/stop
[10:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yeah
[10:01:12] <tj_vantoll> I say we put it in 1.12 for now. That might be overly optimistic, but we can always bump it back.
[10:01:31] <tj_vantoll> If button ends up being ready we can ship it and wait on datepicker.
[10:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, those aren't detractors for UI releases :-P
[10:01:42] <arschmitz> button will be for sure i think
[10:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> Some of us have another meeting to join.
[10:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> Let's finish the discussion in -dev.
