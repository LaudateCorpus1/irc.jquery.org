[12:00:39] <fnagel> hi!
[12:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> hey fnagel!
[12:01:10] <fnagel> nobody else here today?
[12:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz said he'd probably miss the meeting.
[12:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> He's not near a computer at the moment.
[12:02:16] <fnagel> ok
[12:03:21] <fnagel> I've started to work on implementing the current specs for datepicker / calendar. No feedback from Jon Gunderson yet regarding multiple month, etc.
[12:03:41] <fnagel> and I've merged datepicker with master
[12:03:57] <fnagel> * current a11y specs
[12:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[12:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> How long have you been waiting for feedback from Jon?
[12:06:18] <fnagel> almost two month
[12:08:24] <fnagel> Idea was to contact him again when all pending a11y changes are implemented , asking for general feedback and for feedback on the current state of the widgets.
[12:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know if he's working on it or if it may have just slipped off his radar?
[12:08:39] <fnagel> No idea
[12:11:13] <jzaefferer> Re https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1577 - I still haven't done a full review. The known issues were all resolved though, and both the migration guide and the migrate tool were updated accordingly.
[12:11:21] <jzaefferer> (QUnit migration guide, that is)
[12:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> So, what are the chances that the parts you haven't reviewed can actually have bugs?
[12:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> This was all automated, correct?
[12:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> uhoh
[12:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> space indentation
[12:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> Are the globals gone in a new version of QUnit?
[12:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> Can we turn them off right now to verify that this covers everything?
[12:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer?
[12:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> apsdehal ^
[12:23:50] <jzaefferer> In 2.0 they will be gone, throwing errors
[12:23:56] <jzaefferer> but that's not released, yet
[12:24:25] <jzaefferer> I guess we could build and test with this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/976
[12:24:38] <jzaefferer> for spacing issues, talk to apsdehal :-)
[12:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> I commented on the PR in the place that I noticed it.
[12:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how much of that there might be.
[12:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> Could easily run a search for it though.
[12:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we can check the globals pretty easily by removing them from the jshint settings.
[12:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> This list would get pretty short: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/.jshintrc#L20
[12:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you still want to get that PR into RC2?
[12:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't touch any actual functionality. So landing it between the RC and final should be fine.
[12:34:48] <jzaefferer> I'd rather get it into an RC
[12:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:35:21] <jzaefferer> I can do a review after he removed the globals and fixes style issues
[12:35:31] <jzaefferer> Both should make it easier to review...
[12:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> There's this newly filed bug: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14947
[12:36:13] <leobalter> I'm finishing to address the review, it's just taking some extra time as I'm improving my own tests on qunit
[12:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> But the description isn't really clear and the example code isn't very helpful.
[12:37:21] <leobalter> the description on the PR / commit? and which example, The upgrade guide?
[12:37:54] <leobalter> I won't publish anything before the upgrade is really done, also there's a qunit-migrate tool to support changes before upgrading.
[12:38:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also super skeptical that this person knows what they're doing.
[12:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> With lines like:
[12:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> var $select = $("#DocumentsFile_Cat");
[12:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> $select.appendTo("#DocumentsFile_Cat");
[12:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> Appending a select to itself...
[12:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> $.each([data], function(i, optgroups) {
[12:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> Looping over an array that is known to only ever contain one item...
[12:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: So I guess we'll release RC2 whenever that PR lands?
[12:41:51] <jzaefferer> ok
[12:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
