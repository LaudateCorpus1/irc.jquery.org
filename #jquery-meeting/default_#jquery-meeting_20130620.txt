[11:01:57] <uGoMobi> hey
[11:02:13] <_|Nix|_> Yo ho ho and a barrel of grog!
[11:03:12] <arschmitz> Hello
[11:03:30] <_|Nix|_> I see the throngs of jQM developers are all present.
[11:03:33] <uGoMobi> ok back
[11:03:40] <uGoMobi> was disconnected
[11:04:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That'll happen ...
[11:04:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the agenda must have a different default language because you made it it is telling me essentially every word is misspelled lol
[11:04:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang nab it! you /have/ been busy!
[11:05:01] <_|Nix|_> nl_NL is my guess.
[11:05:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:05:07] <uGoMobi> sorry bout that
[11:05:09] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/document/d/18NLGuSS-G2fSb8wEQp0i18rr84GHoDOR6M5vUyeZNWE/edit#
[11:05:16] <uGoMobi> agenda ^^^
[11:05:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol its fine it just threw me off
[11:05:43] <uGoMobi> so is it just the 3 of us?
[11:06:00] <arschmitz> think so
[11:06:02] <_|Nix|_> Yep :) Real crowded in here. Someone please open a window ... *phew*
[11:06:08] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:06:49] <_|Nix|_> So, 1.4 alpha, eh?
[11:06:57] <uGoMobi> right
[11:07:15] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... widgets reviewed?
[11:07:21] <uGoMobi> what have you guys been up to ? :)
[11:07:34] <_|Nix|_> After alpha we stop merging stuff and we just fix bugs, right?
[11:07:54] * uGoMobi noticed that wifi in Canada is bit slower ;)
[11:08:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: alpha changes can be made but it requires another alpha
[11:08:13] <arschmitz> if they are more then trivial
[11:08:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:08:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, understood.
[11:08:51] <uGoMobi> I think you can even remove a feature when it's an alpha release
[11:09:00] <_|Nix|_> Is there anything other than widget review that needs to be done?
[11:09:26] <_|Nix|_> ... cuz I'm thinking widget review, and then we pick a set of bugs to fix for 1.4.0 and then that's it.
[11:09:43] <uGoMobi> so what widgets have been reviewed?
[11:09:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: need to merge tabs
[11:09:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right!
[11:09:54] <arschmitz> and maybe flip
[11:10:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about slider?
[11:10:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we desperately need a well-performing slider.
[11:10:18] <uGoMobi> new slider in 1.5?
[11:10:20] <arschmitz> thought we could push flip to 1.5 but people complain so much already i want to try and finish it
[11:10:27] <uGoMobi> new flip in 1.4?
[11:10:28] <arschmitz> yes new slider for 1.5
[11:10:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats what i was thinking
[11:10:40] <uGoMobi> and deprecate the old one
[11:10:44] <arschmitz> exactly
[11:11:00] <uGoMobi> are tabs and flip both ready to be merged into master?
[11:11:02] <arschmitz> we could not redo slider for 1.4 even if we wanted
[11:11:08] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec ... deprecate old slider? Why do we need to do that? The new slider will have the same interface as the old slider, right?
[11:11:11] <arschmitz> tabs are flip is not it needs tests
[11:11:26] <uGoMobi> okay
[11:11:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: depreciate flip funcationalty from slider
[11:11:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: deprecate old flip toglle
[11:11:40] <uGoMobi> toggle*
[11:11:47] <arschmitz> right
[11:11:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I guess that's fair.
[11:11:56] <arschmitz> because we cant redo slider until thats ripped out
[11:12:00] <uGoMobi> it's going to use different markup, right?
[11:12:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: flip or slider?
[11:12:21] <uGoMobi> flip
[11:12:24] <uGoMobi> sorry
[11:12:44] <_|Nix|_> OK. Sounds like a good plan.
[11:12:46] <arschmitz> yes its more flexible
[11:12:52] <arschmitz> can be checkbox or select
[11:12:53] <uGoMobi> okay
[11:12:59] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:13:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker: wanted to see radio too but i have not added that yet
[11:13:24] <uGoMobi> so let's merge tabs
[11:13:44] <arschmitz> sounds good i just need to make one minor change that was noticed yesterday and ill merge after meeting
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> okay
[11:14:03] <arschmitz> on those same lines
[11:14:05] <uGoMobi> re: other things besides widget review....
[11:14:25] <uGoMobi> when I am back I will look into transitions (blink issues)
[11:14:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there are a few things that could use a good css review
[11:14:52] <arschmitz> like panels
[11:14:58] <uGoMobi> external panels
[11:15:01] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:15:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[11:15:23] <arschmitz> and be good to have you look closely at flip to see if it needs any changes
[11:15:35] <arschmitz> i think its pretty good but your better with css
[11:15:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There may also be a problem with popups outside pages: No theme by default. That may be intentional. They have no place from which to inherit a theme.
[11:15:42] <uGoMobi> that's on my list
[11:16:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that makes sense if you put outside page you must specifiy a theme i would say
[11:16:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we may have to document that, when used outside of pages, popups must be given a theme explicitly, since they have no parent from which to inherit.
[11:16:20] <_|Nix|_> OK, so that needs to be documented.
[11:16:20] <uGoMobi> yeah, that will be a problem in general
[11:16:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think that would be something for all widgets
[11:16:40] <uGoMobi> if you use any widget without a page you have to set a theme
[11:17:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think that makes sense and should be that way
[11:17:13] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... what about custom select popups? It's not easy to specify a theme for those. You pretty much have to bind to popupcreate and call .popup( "option", "theme", <your choice of theme> ); during popupcreate.
[11:17:25] <uGoMobi> okay, we just document that
[11:17:37] <uGoMobi> other thing is alternative for nested listview
[11:17:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you look at the menu widget jsbin i sent you for that?
[11:18:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am ppretty sure I took care of custom selects
[11:18:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I saw that
[11:19:02] <uGoMobi> we have also been talking to make the collapsible widget work on a nested list
[11:19:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats essentially what the menu does
[11:19:32] <arschmitz> the offset is my own doing
[11:19:37] <arschmitz> just to show levels
[11:19:38] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:19:46] <_|Nix|_> Man, that's a lot of duplication between the two libs.
[11:19:54] <arschmitz> yup
[11:20:06] <arschmitz> that was on jorns mobile project doc he sent
[11:20:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, they have the nested listview taken care of. We do not (anymore).
[11:20:20] <arschmitz> that they allready have collapisble and accordian \
[11:20:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are they very different? Can we drop ours?
[11:21:02] <arschmitz> very similar
[11:21:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, re-implement it using theirs for one version, and then drop ours?
[11:21:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill try to do that tonight like i did with other widgets
[11:21:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but that's probably something for > 1.4.0, right?
[11:21:30] <arschmitz> soo how it comes out
[11:21:34] <arschmitz> yes i would think so
[11:22:15] <arschmitz> i think merging in ui widgets we could potentially do a very quick 1.5 release
[11:22:24] <arschmitz> and use it as a way of depreciating a bunch of stuff
[11:23:27] <uGoMobi> (tunnel)
[11:23:46] <arschmitz> its divirging from the roadmap a bit but might be a nice way to do some more cleanup of things that need to have a release for being depreciated
[11:24:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's not bad.
[11:24:02] <uGoMobi> let's discuss this with UI next Wed
[11:24:15] <_|Nix|_> Absolutely.
[11:24:19] <arschmitz> and give more time to work on bigger stuff like slider and content router for 1.6
[11:24:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good
[11:25:12] <_|Nix|_> So, it's next Wednesday during the regular UI meeting, right?
[11:25:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[11:25:25] * _|Nix|_ is adding a reminder
[11:25:32] <uGoMobi> so we have tabs, external panels and new flip toggle
[11:25:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: external toolbars
[11:25:51] <uGoMobi> nested listview alternative
[11:26:12] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec! We have external /everything/
[11:26:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, but those are completely ready right?
[11:26:19] <_|Nix|_> ... part of the widget review, right?
[11:26:23] <arschmitz> thaoh yeah sorry
[11:26:31] <arschmitz> thought you were just listing new features
[11:26:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'd call that a new feature too.
[11:26:59] <_|Nix|_> Same widget, new and exciting functionality!
[11:27:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but he was just listing things that still need to be done
[11:27:04] <uGoMobi> sorry, was listings things that need to be done/finished
[11:27:10] <arschmitz> :)
[11:27:13] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[11:27:23] <_|Nix|_> Well, custom select is also a doozie!
[11:27:31] <uGoMobi> and the new default theme was just a first pass
[11:27:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats basicly part of review though
[11:27:47] <_|Nix|_> ... it still has a lot of .one() and even a .bind(), IINM.
[11:27:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just an execptionaly ugly part :)
[11:28:01] <_|Nix|_> I dunno what to use instead of .one().
[11:28:02] <uGoMobi> what's the status of custom select review?
[11:28:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: old code
[11:28:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lots to do still.
[11:28:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... especially to make it work outside pages.
[11:28:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz:  did you run into an issue??
[11:28:39] <arschmitz> run into an issue with what?
[11:28:56] <uGoMobi> the custom select
[11:29:14] <arschmitz> oh no i have not done much with that its pretty much all _|Nix|_ im working on textinput
[11:29:33] <uGoMobi> my lines show up one minute after I type so I have to be more specific ;)
[11:29:34] <arschmitz> i however did suggest seperating dialog functionality
[11:29:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Have you had a chance to skim over the code in the PR? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6108?
[11:29:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure ... +1
[11:30:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, just noticed a comment from you to _|Nix|_ on IRC
[11:30:45] <uGoMobi> let's deprecate the dialog widget in 1.4 and make it an option for 1.5
[11:30:59] <_|Nix|_> What do you mean "make it an option"?
[11:31:08] <uGoMobi> option in page widget
[11:31:12] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see.
[11:31:17] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Not bad.
[11:31:24] <_|Nix|_> ... and UI also has a dialog.
[11:31:27] <arschmitz> yeah i think we had allready decided that?
[11:31:30] <_|Nix|_> What's their plan re: dialog?
[11:31:31] <uGoMobi> right
[11:31:39] <arschmitz> ui dialog is essentially popup without history
[11:31:45] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wow!
[11:31:57] <_|Nix|_> Sooo much duplication.
[11:32:06] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:32:26] <uGoMobi> okay let's discuss the dialog widget with them as well before we do anything
[11:32:36] <_|Nix|_> It's like a merger of galaxies. An enormous impact, but it's still mostly empty space O_o
[11:33:04] <arschmitz> so i have a couple thoughts on changes to core
[11:33:17] <arschmitz> i want to rip out all data functions into a module
[11:33:18] <uGoMobi> 20:32 <uGoMobi> okay let's discuss the dialog widget with them as well before we do anything
[11:33:18] <uGoMobi> 20:32 <uGoMobi> any other widget that has been or will be reviewed besides custom select?
[11:33:55] <uGoMobi> I saw that frequent has been working on filter widget
[11:34:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i need to talk to him
[11:34:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think all of them - checkboxradio, slider, collapsible, collapsibleSet, popup, the lot.
[11:34:30] <arschmitz> he has it in a seperate repo so not sure if he is going to maintain seperate or whats up with that
[11:34:41] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:34:51] <arschmitz> yeah its not in a fork or anything
[11:35:12] <uGoMobi> BTW - I am almost at Vancouver so I just have couple minutes left
[11:35:23] <_|Nix|_> The widgets I mention should be fairly clean, because I've been over them a few times, but, like, panel, and tables ... *cringe*.
[11:35:41] <arschmitz> tables i think we should punt till 1.5 if we need to
[11:35:46] <uGoMobi> I am in favor of finishing what we started to work on and not add other things
[11:35:47] <arschmitz> its scary in there
[11:35:56] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:36:10] <uGoMobi> maybe we can release 1.5 a bit sooner
[11:36:15] <_|Nix|_> As long as tables work, we should restrict ourselves to bugfixes for 1.4
[11:36:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i mentioned that idea earlier probably missed it in the tunnel
[11:36:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, let's release with whatever we have on schedule.
[11:36:35] <uGoMobi> oh ok, sorry
[11:36:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: agreed
[11:36:47] <arschmitz> do a real fast 1.5 to get some unfinished stuff in then take more time with big stuff for 1,6
[11:37:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not to mention yanking all that we deprecate in 1.4.
[11:37:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah which will make rewrites cleaner
[11:37:20] <uGoMobi> although it is tempting to do more, let's make sure we can release within two weeks
[11:37:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +1
[11:37:37] <_|Nix|_> Woah! Two weeks?
[11:37:45] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:37:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we have our work cut out for us!
[11:38:11] <_|Nix|_> ... especially since I'm supposed to be on vacation next week :/
[11:38:18] <uGoMobi> aha
[11:38:19] <arschmitz> oh damn i forgot that
[11:38:27] <_|Nix|_> Can we make it three weeks? Oh please oh please oh please?
[11:38:51] <arschmitz> i have no objection uGoMobi?
[11:39:03] <uGoMobi> okay, week of Monday July 15?
[11:39:10] <arschmitz> sounds like a plan
[11:39:21] <_|Nix|_> Alright. +1
[11:39:37] <arschmitz> ok one thing real quick
[11:39:48] <_|Nix|_> Better find my old intravenous caffeine equipment.
[11:39:55] <arschmitz> i want to add uniqueid function to core from ui untill we add ui core any objection?
[11:40:09] <uGoMobi> in 1.4?
[11:40:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not from me. Do we use it a lot?
[11:40:15] <arschmitz> we dont at all yet
[11:40:23] <arschmitz> but most ui widgets do
[11:40:28] <arschmitz> tabs needs it
[11:40:32] <arschmitz> and its just plain useful
[11:40:38] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:40:38] <arschmitz> we SHOULD use it
[11:40:45] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... maybe I can use uniqueid to handle .one() and .bind() correctly.
[11:41:08] <uGoMobi> sounds good to me
[11:41:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[11:41:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking I need not worry so much about elements internal to the custom select as much as elements outside of it.
[11:42:05] <uGoMobi> okay I need to get off the train
[11:42:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok take care
[11:42:13] <_|Nix|_> Alright.
[11:42:15] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[11:42:18] <uGoMobi> you guys can continue
[11:42:31] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away: can shut down the room later
[11:42:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok
[11:42:41] <uGoMobi> ok later all
[11:42:49] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[11:43:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Was there anything else?
[11:43:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so anything else we should talk about?
[11:43:23] <arschmitz> ha ha
[11:43:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nah i dont think i have anything else important
[11:43:51] <_|Nix|_> I guess we should stick around a few more minutes for community questions. There was a person at the conference who seemed like he might show up.
[11:43:54] <arschmitz> been super busy but we went over most of it
[11:44:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, eh?
[11:44:16] <arschmitz> would never guess im also launching a new site todau huh?
[11:44:17] <_|Nix|_> So, communité, any questions out there/
[11:44:18] <_|Nix|_> ?
[11:44:24] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:44:42] <agcolom> will upload the minutes
[11:44:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Be careful! Any busier and you'll violate causality.
[11:44:51] <arschmitz> ha ha
[11:44:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey! Thanks!
[11:45:08] <agcolom> sorry my internet was dead until 10 mins ago!
[11:45:26] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[11:45:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What have you been up to?
[11:45:59] <agcolom> recovering ;-) jetlag did not treat me too well :-)
[11:46:09] <_|Nix|_> *nod* ... I know the feeling.
[11:46:17] <agcolom> lack of sleep....
[11:46:47] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, fear not. We'll almost certainly be super busy for 1.4.0.
[11:46:49] <agcolom> but I'm good now. had to do some work until 1am last night (for work!) so a bit tired today, but all ok otherwise :-)
[11:46:58] <agcolom> yes
[11:46:58] <arschmitz> wow so im the only person in the USA thats really around any more lol
[11:47:25] <agcolom> yes arschmitz you'll soon have to adapt to European time :-)
[11:47:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I think he's doing pretty well already.
[11:47:49] <agcolom> yep!
[11:48:08] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: could you add a line for me in the update?
[11:48:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: For sure! Do tell!
[11:49:02] <agcolom>  corrections to the  api docs:
[11:49:05] <_|Nix|_> BTW: Happy midsummer, everybody! Big holiday here in Scandinavia! Longest day of the year 'n all ...
[11:49:17] <agcolom>  - fixed dead links
[11:49:58] <agcolom> - removed inline styles
[11:50:35] <agcolom> - updated jquery core and mobile versions for v mouse events example
[11:50:55] <agcolom> that's it :-)
[11:50:58] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[11:50:59] <arschmitz> agcolom: not sure if you saw issue but i think we should remove the orientation change example
[11:51:08] <agcolom> yes, I saw that...
[11:51:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Alright. You got it!
[11:51:28] <arschmitz> its not possible for it to actually work in the api docs
[11:51:32] <agcolom> would it work if someone looked at it from a mobile device though?
[11:51:38] <arschmitz> no
[11:51:48] <agcolom> so they would have to open just the iframe?
[11:51:52] <arschmitz> it will always read window dimensions wich is the iframe
[11:52:25] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah basicly that event cannot work within an iframe
[11:52:32] <arschmitz> only on the actual page
[11:52:49] <arschmitz> would work on a resizable iframe lol
[11:53:03] <agcolom> at the same time, some people have no idea how to write such an example, so that's why I thought it'd still be good to have...
[11:53:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait, isn't there a native orientationchange as well?
[11:53:29] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:53:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we can provide some "simulate" buttons ... or put a demo in /resources/
[11:54:07] <arschmitz> yeah or point them to demos
[11:54:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[11:54:33] <arschmitz> we should have some examples / demos of it they just cant be in api iframes
[11:54:53] <agcolom> yes, we should have the example somewhere
[11:54:54] <_|Nix|_> We should do a brief docs sweep before release.
[11:55:03] <agcolom> good idea...
[11:55:04] <arschmitz> yes execpt maybe more then brief lol
[11:55:22] <arschmitz> docs can be done durring alpha beta rc though
[11:55:25] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:55:28] <arschmitz> when its hard to do feature work
[11:55:38] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure. I just realized that.
[11:55:57] <arschmitz> kinda like we did last time after alpha it was all hands on deck for demos and docs
[11:56:02] <_|Nix|_> We can comb the docs while waiting for the world to crash in the issues.
[11:56:13] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:56:22] <arschmitz> speak of such things
[11:56:34] <arschmitz> code.jquery.com is 100% manual update of an html file
[11:56:50] <_|Nix|_> Yikes.
[11:56:55] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[11:56:57] <arschmitz> i gave myself access to the server so i can do that now but we need to make sure its done at each release
[11:57:17] <arschmitz> or i do an a friendly reminder can never hurt lol
[11:57:20] <_|Nix|_> Right. There was a checklist somewhere. We should ask uGoMobi about it.
[11:57:30] <arschmitz> yeah make sure this is added
[11:58:33] <agcolom> there is a checklist on github...
[11:58:49] <agcolom> but it needs more now... also with the api docs...
[11:59:59] <_|Nix|_> I'll update the checklist with the manual update step.
[12:00:17] <agcolom> here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[12:00:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ha ha i was editing and it kicked me out because you did it
[12:00:56] <_|Nix|_> OK. I think we should call it a meeting.
[12:01:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: agreed
[12:01:04] * _|Nix|_ is eager to kick off his vacation :)
[12:01:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: mind muting the room?
[12:01:28] <_|Nix|_> Alright. CY'all on -dev!
[12:03:12] <agcolom> oh, I think I can actually do that now...
[12:03:20] <agcolom> just have to remember how!
[12:05:04] <arschmitz> agcolom: no only people in here right now that can are gnarf gseguin and jzaefferer they have op status
[12:05:31] <agcolom> I was added 2 weeks ago...
[12:05:45] <agcolom> but looks like I was removed..
[12:05:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: weird
[12:06:10] <gseguin> Alright, muting now.
[13:00:52] <gnarf> agcolom: you can op whenever you want... just /msg chanserv op #jquery-meeting (assuming you are identified)
[13:01:54] <gnarf> uGoMobi: added you to -meeting's op list too
[15:37:01] <gseguin> agcolom: you need to "/msg chanserv op #jquery-meeting agcolom" to get opped on the channel
