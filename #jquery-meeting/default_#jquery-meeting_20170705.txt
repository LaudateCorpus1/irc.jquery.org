[12:03:39] <arschmitz> hi
[12:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not prepared for today at all :-/
[12:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> And it looks like it's just the two of us.
[12:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like we've got some broken tests.
[12:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryui
[12:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like focus issues.
[12:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps a BrowserStack problem.
[12:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> The IBM people are really anxious to get the text direction PR merged.
[12:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had a chance to review it again since the update.
[12:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that, we just need to get the release out.
[12:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> So unless arschmitz has anything to discuss right now, I think we're done.
[12:07:43] <arschmitz> nope
[12:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, I guess we'll close the channel then.
