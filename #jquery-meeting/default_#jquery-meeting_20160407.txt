[12:00:23] <bethge> Hi
[12:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> hey bethge
[12:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> I saw that you pushed another update for enter/leave.
[12:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> That's back out of WIP?
[12:03:18] <bethge> Right, there actually are tests for the pointerleave/enter propagation in the w3c suite
[12:03:25] <bethge> (is one test)
[12:04:15] <bethge> It already passed before because it think we missed a step, so I modified it and now it would break and master and passes on the PR.
[12:04:41] <bethge> s/and master/on master/
[12:04:41] <b-ot> Correction, <bethge> It already passed before because it think we missed a step, so I modified it and now it would break on master and passes on the PR.
[12:05:42] <bethge> The test is only for a simple propagation of going two nodes up the DOM, not for more advanced stuff.
[12:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:08:35] <bethge> I am undecided if more elaborate and complex tests should be added to the w3c test.
[12:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's stick with what's already there and if we find bugs that aren't covered by the tests, we can expand on them.
[12:10:11] <bethge> Sounds good.
[12:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll find some time to review that this week.
[12:11:35] <bethge> Sweet
[12:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> Along with merging the old test PR from jdalton (at least the parts that are good for now).
[12:13:34] <bethge> I was wondering, we do not have any applicants for writing the mobile tests as a part of gsoc, do we?
[12:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[12:14:19] <bethge> darn ;)
[12:16:29] <bethge> I start looking into https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/235 this week, see why we are doing the things do.
[12:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> oh great
[12:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Are you here?
[12:20:02] <arschmitz> i am sorry just got back
[12:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/245 merged.
[12:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, hey :-)
[12:20:20] <arschmitz> i can do it this after noon
[12:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> great
[12:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> Did you get a chance to check the dependencies yet?
[12:20:44] <arschmitz> no but ill do it before i land it
[12:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> We still haven't gotten a response on https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/233
[12:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> For the offsetX/Y polyfill.
[12:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to ping someone outside of GitHub to get them to confirm the implementation is correct.
[12:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for us to discuss today?
[12:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:34:58] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[14:09:36] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot gabrielschulhof  agcolom  apsdehal sfrisk meeting time
[14:09:56] <gabrielschulhof> Yo ho ho and a barrel of grog!
[14:10:22] <jasperdegroot> hi
[14:10:35] <gabrielschulhof> I saw the new demos. Niiiiice!
[14:13:25] <sfrisk> allo!
[14:23:50] <arschmitz> hey all sory
[14:23:55] <arschmitz> got pulled away
[14:24:13] <arschmitz> so i think the only thing i really happened this week was gabrielschulhof updated the selectmenu pr
[14:24:15] <arschmitz> today
[14:24:25] <arschmitz> Ill try to review it today or tomorrow
[14:24:31] <gabrielschulhof> Awesome!
[14:24:32] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else this week?
[14:24:45] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Could you also please have a look to make sure all the styling is good?
[14:25:20] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: yes I will
[14:25:33] <gabrielschulhof> Is it OK that the icon span /must/ precede the text span in order for it to work on FF?
[14:25:42] <jasperdegroot> already gave a quick look, but will review a bit more this weekend
[14:25:52] <jasperdegroot> together with that icon space issue
[14:25:53] <gabrielschulhof> Awesome! Thanks al lot!
[14:25:55] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof thats normal with FF and float
[14:26:13] <arschmitz> we had to fix exact same thing in UI recently
[14:26:14] <gabrielschulhof> OK, then so it stays.
[14:26:45] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I hope I fixed it correctly.
[14:27:04] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do we copy that fix to JQM?
[14:27:20] <arschmitz> it was specific to selectmenu in ui
[14:27:28] <arschmitz> because we float the icon similarly
[14:27:48] <arschmitz> so there is nothing to copy execpt to look at how we did it
[14:27:55] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Got a link?
[14:28:24] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1685
[14:28:26] <arschmitz> and
[14:28:30] <jasperdegroot> well if we look at how it is done and then do the same... i call that copy :)
[14:28:35] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1671
[14:28:43] <jasperdegroot> ah, thanks for the links
[14:29:05] <arschmitz> the first one caused the FF issue
[14:29:08] <arschmitz> second one fixes it
[14:29:18] <arschmitz> and also fixes some issues with overflow elipsis
[14:29:26] <arschmitz> when you float it like that
[14:30:22] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, looks like the DOM order fixes it.
[14:30:38] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof yes the rest is to make overflow elipsis work
[14:31:22] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: That might be another issue with custom selectmenu. I believe the popup is too narrow compared to 1.4.5.
[14:32:01] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: The placeholder is getting ellipsized a lot.
[14:32:22] <jasperdegroot> let me see
[14:32:52] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: ah, you already fixed that FF issue, right?
[14:32:56] <jasperdegroot> was a bit confused
[14:34:01] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Yeah, but view took its time updating.
[14:34:07] <jasperdegroot> right
[14:34:15] <jasperdegroot> I see that it's ok now
[14:34:38] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that part seems to be good now. Just maybe the width of the popup.
[14:34:46] <jasperdegroot> so we only have to fix the width of the custom select popup and the padding for the icon
[14:34:50] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:35:03] <gabrielschulhof> Maybe. I will trust your eyes.
[14:38:16] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: http://view.jquerymobile.com/7731-selectmenu-classes-option/demos/selectmenu-custom/ when I open the long list example the selectmenu gets positioned very low (on Chrome)
[14:38:46] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Yeah, I noticed that too ...
[14:39:24] <gabrielschulhof> Weird, it's OK at first, and then it jumps down.
[14:41:08] <jasperdegroot> yeah exactly
[14:41:42] <gabrielschulhof> Alright ... more stuff to fix.
[14:43:21] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: the problem with the placeholder is that we don't override the margin anymore
[14:43:44] <jasperdegroot> headers have 30% margin left and right
[14:44:05] <jasperdegroot> for selectmenu we used to override that with  2.875em left and right
[14:45:35] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: ... and the dialog moves to some value of y > 0 for some reason.
[14:45:42] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: It starts out at 0 and then moves down.
[14:45:51] <gabrielschulhof> Probably at the end of the transition;.
[14:46:02] <gabrielschulhof> I don't get why ... it's position: relative and top: 0
[14:46:14] <jasperdegroot> weird
[14:47:43] <gabrielschulhof> Alright, I guess I'll take a look at some of these issues over the course of the next week.
[14:48:07] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: The CSS is still in selectmenu.css but the classes need to be updated: .ui-selectmenu-custom .ui-header .ui-title { margin: 0 2.875em; } ---> .ui-selectmenu-custom .ui-toolbar-header .ui-toolbar-title { margin: 0 2.875em; }
[14:49:07] <jasperdegroot> just add -toolbar- in the selectors and it should be the same as before again
[14:49:18] <gabrielschulhof> Aaaah! OK. The class names in selectmenu do not have the toolbar modifications.
[14:49:25] <jasperdegroot> yup
[14:49:29] <gabrielschulhof> Alright. Can fix!
[14:49:36] <jasperdegroot> I am sure you can :)
[14:51:11] <gabrielschulhof> Wow! There were actually quite a few rules with ui-header.
[14:52:23] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: I think we should do a search in the whole repo as soon as everything is in 1.5-dev
[14:52:45] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[14:53:26] <jasperdegroot> not just for toolbar classes
[14:54:55] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, we've renamed a lot of classes.
[15:12:49] <gabrielschulhof> I'm gonna close the channel, since it looks like we're done for the week.
