[14:04:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: cgack: jasperdegroot: apsdehal: meeting time
[14:04:21] <cgack> howdy
[14:05:30] <jasperdegroot> hello again
[14:08:02] <arschmitz> lets get started
[14:08:21] <arschmitz> missing gabriel again
[14:09:43] <cgack> I was able to cherry-pick his table review branch onto 1.5-dev... but...
[14:10:15] <cgack> trying to get the tests to pass is a nightmare after adding classes
[14:10:44] <arschmitz> cgack: what exactly is the issue in tests
[14:10:58] <cgack> I think its because he used $.mobile.table.prototype to test methods, so this._addClass doesn't exist
[14:11:00] <cgack> etc
[14:11:24] <cgack> I haven't really looked into the integration tests yet, but they are failing all over the place too
[14:14:26] <arschmitz> ohhhh
[14:14:52] <cgack> so anyway, I am back to thinking.
[14:14:52] <cgack> a) I try to get the tests green and push and we can try to rework the tests that used the prototype
[14:14:52] <cgack> b) I push it in a broken state and we use it to base off table-review-X that we can target for 1.6
[14:14:52] <cgack> c) I take the table as it is on 1.5-dev and just add classes
[14:15:38] <arschmitz> so i think c wont work
[14:15:57] <arschmitz> because those get added to the prototype regardless of classes
[14:16:03] <arschmitz> the widget factory adds them
[14:16:49] <arschmitz> cgack: the base factory addes both the classes option and all those methods and we cant get around that
[14:17:30] <cgack> arschmitz: what i'm seeing is this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/7360-table-review/tests/unit/table/table_core.js#L3
[14:18:07] <arschmitz> ok and where is that failing?
[14:18:24] <cgack> which when those tests hit this._addClass it is undefined
[14:18:35] <arschmitz> oh weird
[14:18:47] <arschmitz> there is something more to that
[14:19:04] <arschmitz> because _addClass should be part of the prototype
[14:19:21] <cgack> well it works in the demos
[14:19:26] <arschmitz> im not sure why hes doing it that way though
[14:19:33] <arschmitz> thats weird
[14:19:48] <cgack> anyway, i was just commenting those out for now to find the other test issues and then i was going to circle back.
[14:19:53] <arschmitz> oh maybe he didnt know you could $.mobile.table();
[14:20:01] <arschmitz> yeah im not worried about thoes
[14:20:10] <arschmitz> id rather skip those tests and revisit later
[14:20:26] <cgack> I can create a WIP PR once i get the others green and we can circle back
[14:20:29] <arschmitz> sadly im not sure about your option B
[14:20:32] <arschmitz> how that would work
[14:20:48] <arschmitz> you mean we release with broken tests?
[14:21:21] <arschmitz> oh you should not need to comment those out though i think we should have qunit skip now
[14:21:30] <arschmitz> https://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.skip/
[14:21:36] <cgack> well perfect
[14:22:23] <cgack> i'll do that and get them green. I'm hoping to get some time next week to focus on mobile after {{dayjob}} release on tuesday
[14:22:39] <arschmitz> cool i know the feeling
[14:22:51] <arschmitz> i should get more time starting next too in theory
[14:23:41] <cgack> awesome. that's all I had
[14:23:47] <arschmitz> cool
[14:24:26] <jasperdegroot> I have been looking into the failing demos spider test
[14:24:31] <jasperdegroot> in 1.5-demos-issues
[14:24:39] <jasperdegroot> but I really can't figure it out
[14:24:46] <arschmitz> i saw your comment
[14:25:06] <arschmitz> so our demos only work without a server to an extent and only in the dist folder
[14:25:07] <jasperdegroot> and I don't see the issue on view.*
[14:25:15] <arschmitz> but it sounds like thats what you were doing
[14:25:20] <jasperdegroot> or in /dist/
[14:25:45] <jasperdegroot> ok, so maybe that's not an issue
[14:26:06] <jasperdegroot> but when I go to demos in the dist folder on my web server the demos look good
[14:26:15] <jasperdegroot> meaning, all CSS and JS loads
[14:26:26] <jasperdegroot> so I don't understand why the spider reports issues
[14:28:44] <jasperdegroot> I thought the demos would also work with file:// protocol, so that's why I opened that ticket
[14:28:59] <arschmitz> they should
[14:29:02] <arschmitz> for the most part
[14:29:04] <apsdehal> hi, sorry I am late.
[14:29:11] <arschmitz> there are individual ones that wont work
[14:29:11] <jasperdegroot> hi apsedal
[14:29:16] <arschmitz> but most should
[14:29:36] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ah ok, then there is still something to look into
[14:29:43] <arschmitz> yes it sounds it
[14:29:53] <arschmitz> im not sure whats not resolving on file
[14:30:01] <arschmitz> but that at least lets us know a place to start
[14:30:38] <jasperdegroot> what I don't understand is that the demos test doesn't fail on 1.5-dev, but do fail on 1.5-demos-issues
[14:30:49] <arschmitz> yeah i dont know
[14:31:07] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: would be great if you could take a look
[14:31:11] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Do we really need those reload tests in events module?
[14:31:54] <arschmitz> apsdehal: im not sure
[14:32:01] <arschmitz> apsdehal: if we pass without then no
[14:32:23] <apsdehal> Ok.
[14:37:20] <jasperdegroot> *cricket*
[14:37:57] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do you have updates?
[14:38:06] <arschmitz> yes
[14:38:07] <arschmitz> sorry
[14:38:11] <arschmitz> multiple meetings
[14:38:25] <arschmitz> so i updated the PR for pagecontainer
[14:38:48] <arschmitz> i have one thing i wanted to bring up
[14:39:09] <arschmitz> which is gabriel suggested switching some things to $.mobile.pagecontainers.active
[14:39:22] <arschmitz> but i think right now it will be a lot of work and not worth it
[14:39:31] <arschmitz> because $.mobile.pageContainer
[14:39:42] <arschmitz> is a little different in that its set even when there is not pagecontinaer
[14:39:46] <arschmitz> because its part of init
[14:39:50] <arschmitz> and also
[14:39:55] <arschmitz> pagecontainer( "Change"
[14:40:04] <arschmitz> is a little different then .changePage
[14:40:11] <arschmitz> because again you actually need a pagecontainer
[14:40:17] <arschmitz> and you didnt before
[14:40:22] <jasperdegroot> I see
[14:40:23] <arschmitz> so bad things could pass through
[14:40:34] <arschmitz> you could call cange when there was nothing to chang
[14:41:04] <jasperdegroot> if we want to make some changes there it could wait until after 1.5, right?
[14:41:08] <arschmitz> yes
[14:41:20] <jasperdegroot> I really think that we should stick to essentials
[14:41:25] <arschmitz> i agree
[14:41:42] <arschmitz> so ill push the update to that there are only trivial changes so i think we can go right to 1.5
[14:41:55] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:41:58] <arschmitz> i also started a blog post
[14:42:07] <jasperdegroot> I was about to ask about that
[14:42:11] <jasperdegroot> good
[14:42:18] <arschmitz> i think we should publish it at same time as ui beta
[14:42:32] <arschmitz> which should be any day the only blocker is an issue with api site
[14:42:43] <jasperdegroot> I think we should publish ASAP
[14:42:57] <arschmitz> its going to refrence the ui 1.12 a lot
[14:43:02] <arschmitz> which is why i think it should go with it
[14:43:10] <jasperdegroot> ok I understand
[14:43:18] <arschmitz> and it should be any day
[14:43:23] <arschmitz> its 100% done all updates are done
[14:43:29] <arschmitz> its an infrastructure issue
[14:43:29] <jasperdegroot> It's just that there is a lot of negative communication about the project
[14:43:41] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:43:41] <jasperdegroot> a lot of people complaining
[14:43:53] <arschmitz> yup i want to get it out but i want something to refrence our changes
[14:44:04] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:44:21] <jasperdegroot> this ticket has been reopened https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8336
[14:44:43] <jasperdegroot> you might want to refer to your blog post when it's published and then close the ticket again
[14:44:48] <arschmitz> yeah im going to comment that we are releasing a blog to answrr
[14:44:59] <arschmitz> his question
[14:45:03] <jasperdegroot> sounds good
[14:45:33] <agcolom> hi, sorry only just arrived back!
[14:45:40] <jasperdegroot> hi agcolom
[14:47:42] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I hope we can turn the negative vibe into a positive one
[14:47:49] <arschmitz> me too
[14:47:59] <agcolom> hi everyone! don't forget to take notes... https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=1383409736
[14:48:09] <jasperdegroot> at this moment people might not be interested to contribute to the project because they think it's inactive
[14:48:11] <agcolom> I've updated PR and issue numbers
[14:48:29] <jasperdegroot> while in fact we can use every help that we can get
[14:48:34] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: for sure
[14:50:17] <cgack> is table the only outstanding widget before we're ready to roll this out
[14:50:25] <arschmitz> panel
[14:50:28] <arschmitz> and selectmenu
[14:50:56] <jasperdegroot> and selectmenu is the one that keeps us from merging 1.5-dev in master, right?
[14:51:13] <arschmitz> yes
[14:51:22] <arschmitz> but no gabriel in a few weeks
[14:52:38] <cgack> looks like his WIP PR for that is ready? or nearly ready?
[14:53:11] <jasperdegroot> yeah, this is the last thing I saw https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8309#issuecomment-161740867
[14:53:31] <arschmitz> yeah its pretty small stuff overall
[14:53:40] <arschmitz> but waiting on gabriel
[14:53:47] <arschmitz> he was not in the dev leads meeting this week either
[14:54:15] <jasperdegroot> it would be great if we can finish those last few small things so we can merge 1.5-dev in master
[14:54:26] <jasperdegroot> then people notice activity again
[14:54:29] <arschmitz> yup
[14:55:52] <jasperdegroot> let's ping Gabriel and ask when/if he has time for that
[14:56:21] <jasperdegroot> we have some other blocker issues for 1.5 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Priority%3A+Blocker%22+milestone%3A1.5.0
[14:56:56] <jasperdegroot> but maybe some are not 100% blocker for beta
[14:56:57] <arschmitz> sounds good
[14:57:05] <arschmitz> yeah we should try to review that
[14:57:12] <jasperdegroot> we can over them next time
[14:57:22] <jasperdegroot> can go*
[14:57:33] <arschmitz> sounds good we are short on time
[14:57:36] <jasperdegroot> s/can/can go/
[14:57:43] <jasperdegroot> aww no bot
[14:57:50] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:58:45] <arschmitz> ok im going to get my 2 hanging pr's merged
[14:58:51] <arschmitz> so we have those out of the way
[14:58:59] <arschmitz> and get the blog ready to go with the ui beta
[14:59:05] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ill try and look at demos too
[14:59:19] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: great, I'll keep dinging too
[14:59:25] <jasperdegroot> digging*
[14:59:51] <cgack> and i'll get table ready for review
[14:59:53] <jasperdegroot> I was curious about the status of the download builder
[15:00:06] <jasperdegroot> we didn't talk about that for a while
[15:00:10] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: download builder is a no go for mobile for 1.5
[15:00:13] <jasperdegroot> but let's do that next week
[15:00:15] <arschmitz> for now
[15:00:22] <arschmitz> im not sure what our path forward there is
[15:00:25] <jasperdegroot> oh ok, I missed that memo ;)
[15:00:35] <jasperdegroot> ok we can discuss later
[15:01:00] <jasperdegroot> let's focus on things that we are going to do / need to do for 1.5
[15:01:20] <jasperdegroot> I'll continue with fixing and cleaning up demos
[15:01:27] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: sonds great
[15:09:06] <arschmitz> ok lets cal this a day
[15:09:11] <arschmitz> see everyone back on dev
[15:09:30] <jasperdegroot> ok later all
