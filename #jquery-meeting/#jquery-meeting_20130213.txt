[09:03:00] <kborchers> hi
[09:03:00] <rxaviers> hello
[09:03:01] <petersendidit> hey
[09:03:03] <Dave_Stein> hey
[09:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> sorry about that
[09:03:11] <tj_vantoll_phone> Heyo
[09:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> Linkinus wasn't showing that the channel was +m
[09:03:36] * scott_gonzalez waits for kborchers to tell me I shouldn't be using Linkinus...
[09:03:44] <kborchers> :D
[09:03:58] <kborchers> Textual FTW
[09:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure I'll switch one day...
[09:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> So, let's get started with download builder updates.
[09:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers made a pretty big change to rendering, right?
[09:05:29] <rxaviers> that's correct. Now, server dont send the HTML to client, but JSON.
[09:05:56] <rxaviers> client renders the HTML itself. We reduced traffic this way and some CPU processing
[09:06:49] <rxaviers> this has been done in the DB side.. There are some potential TR places that needs to be changed as well.
[09:07:43] <fnagel1> hey
[09:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> Is there any noticable difference in perceived page load time for users?
[09:10:02] <rxaviers> it should be
[09:10:08] <rxaviers> let me get the size differences
[09:11:03] <rxaviers> > Reducing the traffic by 65% on components (6.2KB vs. 18KB), and by 16% on theme (34.6KB vs. 41.5KB).
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:13:18] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Want to plan on 2.0 work kicking up again next week?
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: yes :-)
[09:14:38] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: scott_gonzalez where do you think you're headed next? droppable? i started playing with the resizable rewrite
[09:14:44] <Dave_Stein> excellent.. ive been out of office for 2 weeks so this week is super-catchup-time.
[09:14:53] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: definitely droppable since draggable is not complete until that
[09:15:48] <kborchers> ok cool … it's weird. i tried some basic changes to resizable to just try to use the interactions stuff and it still works with mouse, and works when you simulate touch events but fails on my iphone. just started messing with it though
[09:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: If you're working from existing resizable code, it's probably reading properties from the events.
[09:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> Which is going to fail for touch.
[09:16:52] * scott_gonzalez censors feelings about Touch Events
[09:16:59] <kborchers> i think i most of that but probably missed stuff. it was late last night
[09:17:38] <kborchers> anyway, sorry for hijacking the meeting … proceed :)
[09:17:53] <Dave_Stein> haha
[09:18:07] <Dave_Stein> well do you wanna meet about API via skype early next week? then i can get truckin before next wednesday's meeting
[09:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that works for me.
[09:19:06] <Dave_Stein> okay during workday or post?
[09:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> During is always easier for me, but either usually works.
[09:19:40] <Dave_Stein> okay how about monday 11am est then?
[09:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> worksforme
[09:19:58] <Dave_Stein> sweet
[09:20:03] <kborchers> i'd like to jump in that meeting too … even if you only talk about droppable api for now
[09:20:13] <Dave_Stein> of course
[09:20:14] <kborchers> i'm available that time too
[09:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:20:49] <Dave_Stein> cool.. and with that i'm off til the skype so i can eat before my next meeting :)
[09:20:52] <Dave_Stein> see you guys later
[09:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> There's not much else on the agenda.
[09:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> We're ready for the 1.10.1 release, just working through some issues with the deploy process.
[09:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> We need to clean up some hacky code we wrote that hijacks download builder.
[09:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> Something rxaviers yelled at us for a long time ago and we've just been putting it off.
[09:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> It pretty much breaks every release and we just keep patching over it.
[09:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> So now we're actually discussing a real solution.
[09:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ticket triage is still going strong.
[09:25:20] <scott_gonzalez> Down 8 tickets from last week.
[09:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> And 8 pending, with about half of them getting ready to auto-close this week.
[09:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm very much looking forward to the day we hit 350.
[09:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll_phone has been amazing at finding related tickets as they come in.
[09:26:40] <petersendidit> me too
[09:27:48] <tj_vantoll_phone> :) helps to have done it for awhile. What do we want to do with those two Opera tickets?
[09:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, wait till WebKit Opera comes out? :-P
[09:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> Is there an Opera CSS hack we can use?
[09:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> Changing the values causes 1px issues in other browsers.
[09:31:48] <tj_vantoll_phone> I'm not aware of a hack. Seems reasonable to wait.
[09:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://bricss.net/post/11230266445/css-hack-to-target-opera
[09:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> That hack is crazy :-)
[09:33:21] <tj_vantoll_phone> Wow
[09:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we can try that.
[09:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> Is that slider bug still relevant?
[09:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> bah, BrowserStack has 11.6x and 12.1x, but not 12.0x
[09:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure when Opera started supporting fractions.
[09:38:48] <tj_vantoll_phone> I don't know. I can check later tonight.
[09:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like slider range works properly in latest Opera.
[09:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> That test page linked from the ticket shows the problem really well.
[09:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look at the spinner one again.
[09:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> It definitely causes off-by-1 issues, so I think it's just a matter of which direction the error occurs in Opera.
[09:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll probably do the 55% thing, but inside the Opera hack.
[09:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
