[11:03:17] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:03:22] <agcolom> Hi :-)
[11:03:55] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[11:04:02] <uGoMobi> ok let's get started
[11:04:09] <gseguin> let's do it!
[11:04:20] <agcolom> I'm sort of on and off (dinner time)
[11:04:20] <uGoMobi> planning is still to release 1.4 alpha today
[11:04:27] <uGoMobi> enjoy your dinner agcolom
[11:04:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Bon ap√©tit!
[11:04:53] <uGoMobi> but I don't like to release in the evening (US time)
[11:05:01] <_|Nix|_> s/ap/app/
[11:05:06] <gseguin> uGoMobi: what time are you thinking?
[11:05:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's 11:05 on the West coast ...
[11:05:52] <arschmitz> but 2:00 on east coast ...
[11:05:59] <gseguin> it's even earlier in Hawai
[11:06:02] <gseguin> :P
[11:06:03] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:06:05] <uGoMobi> depends on if arschmitz still has his notebook or he smashed it out the window
[11:06:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it survives
[11:06:18] <uGoMobi> thanks for the time check
[11:06:26] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I can do the release as well if needed
[11:06:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: feel free if you want to do it
[11:07:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes I was counting on you doing the release
[11:07:23] <gseguin> alright just tell me when
[11:07:32] <uGoMobi> it's just that arschmitz needs his notebook to finish work
[11:07:37] <arschmitz> lol
[11:07:42] <uGoMobi> and I am not finished with post and changelog
[11:08:27] <uGoMobi> if we release in the evening we will miss some twitter buzz I think
[11:09:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so what time did you have in mind? east coast we are getting there fast
[11:09:38] <uGoMobi> I think I need to 1-2 hours to get blog post ready
[11:09:58] <arschmitz> ok so after meeting we would be looking at 5 ish
[11:09:59] <uGoMobi> but also have to update ext-panels unit tests
[11:10:03] <arschmitz> east coast
[11:10:21] <uGoMobi> yeah probably 5pm ET
[11:10:24] <gseguin> ok 2pm MDT works for me
[11:11:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think you can finish before 5pm?
[11:11:23] <arschmitz> yes
[11:11:37] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:11:50] <uGoMobi> then we go for release today at end of afternoon
[11:12:25] <uGoMobi> please check https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog if we missed anything
[11:12:38] <uGoMobi> I think the new enhance option is not in there yet
[11:12:52] <uGoMobi> and _setOptions for collapsibe
[11:12:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^^ :)
[11:13:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: GOod point.
[11:13:20] <uGoMobi> just small fix right? ;)
[11:13:27] <uGoMobi> easy
[11:14:16] <uGoMobi> anyone else has something to discuss re: 1.4 alpha release?
[11:15:15] <uGoMobi> if not, I have one other thing
[11:15:22] <uGoMobi> ho is going to Austin conf and will be there on Thursday for the UI/Mobile meeting as well?
[11:15:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Added _setOptions and "enhance"
[11:15:31] <arschmitz> i am / will
[11:15:32] <uGoMobi> s/ho/who/
[11:15:34] <_|Nix|_> Not me :(
[11:15:43] <gseguin> I'll be there, just confirmed with my manager
[11:15:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks !
[11:15:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Awesome!
[11:16:05] <uGoMobi> I know agcolom will be there too
[11:16:11] <arschmitz> yup
[11:16:35] <uGoMobi> and maybe jlembeck and/or toddmparker
[11:17:36] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:17:48] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss today?
[11:18:18] <_|Nix|_> Merge ALL the branches!
[11:18:40] <uGoMobi> all? :/
[11:18:45] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:18:47] <uGoMobi> cleanup all the branches!
[11:18:51] <gseguin> oh I started refactoring the code to remove the jquery.mobile prefix
[11:18:52] <_|Nix|_> Better.
[11:19:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ah nice
[11:19:04] <gseguin> I put that in a local branch for now
[11:19:14] <gseguin> tests are failing left and right
[11:19:24] <gseguin> once it's stabilized I'll push to a branch
[11:19:35] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:20:02] <uGoMobi> we have to look at the CSS files too
[11:20:14] <uGoMobi> naming should consistent with the JS
[11:20:24] <gseguin> yup, but that's pretty straight forward I think
[11:20:30] <uGoMobi> use subfolders instead of prefix etc
[11:20:37] <gseguin> xactly
[11:20:42] <uGoMobi> gseguin: it is, but we have to do it
[11:21:07] <gseguin> do we have an issue to keep track of that?
[11:21:11] <gseguin> so I can claim it?
[11:21:17] <uGoMobi> there is a ticket about file order
[11:21:24] <gseguin> ok
[11:21:36] <uGoMobi> I wanted to add a comment to that ticket
[11:22:04] <uGoMobi> gseguin: if you filter on dev tasks it's easier to find that ticket
[11:22:15] <gseguin> cool
[11:22:16] <gseguin> thanks
[11:22:19] <uGoMobi> maybe rename it to file reorganization or something
[11:22:34] <uGoMobi> ok i think that's all
[11:22:42] <uGoMobi> questions from the community?
[11:23:23] <eddiemonge> shortest meeting ever that ive attended
[11:23:43] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:25:06] <uGoMobi> thanks all
[11:25:11] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:25:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: can you turn off the lights and close the door?
[11:25:43] <gseguin> sure
