[11:05:39] <uGoMobi> +o
[11:05:44] <agcolom> hey :-)
[11:05:46] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:06:03] <toddmparker> Hi
[11:06:11] <arschmitz> hi all
[11:06:12] <uGoMobi> hi :)
[11:06:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: can you edit the agenda doc now?
[11:06:50] <johnbender> hi
[11:07:06] <uGoMobi> jQuery Mobile meeting agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h6QIhTWR-rPoP9sxw8PETJEdq0yuKxfj5ZZSHrV8aWE/edit#
[11:08:29] <uGoMobi> Gabriel is still on vacation
[11:09:37] <uGoMobi> as discussed in Portland we want shorter meetings
[11:09:55] <uGoMobi> so I split the agenda doc up in agenda and updates
[11:10:15] <uGoMobi> updates will just be posted on meetings.jquery.org
[11:10:52] <uGoMobi> if you have something that needs to be discussed with whole team it can be added to the agenda section
[11:11:01] <uGoMobi> any objections?
[11:11:10] <uGoMobi> or suggestions? :)
[11:12:17] <uGoMobi> ok, I guess not
[11:12:18] <arschmitz> im fine with that
[11:12:38] <uGoMobi> I added UI/Mobile meetings as agenda item
[11:13:13] <uGoMobi> already said in my email to you all yesterday
[11:13:17] <uGoMobi> but for the record...
[11:13:32] <uGoMobi> UI/Mobile meetings won't be every week
[11:13:44] <uGoMobi> and do not replace the Mobile weekly meetings
[11:13:59] <uGoMobi> they will probably once a month
[11:14:29] <uGoMobi> and for the community... the idea behind this is that we want to merge both projects at some point
[11:15:40] <uGoMobi> next item is: 1.4 alpha release in week of Mon July 15
[11:16:09] <uGoMobi> last week Gabriel, Alex and I had team meeting we discussed the planning
[11:16:31] <uGoMobi> many people are asking when 1.4 can be expected
[11:17:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: maybe you can tweet this from @jquerymobile account?
[11:17:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe we should do an announcment in the forums too? and try and encourage people to test the alpha?
[11:18:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good idea
[11:18:58] <uGoMobi> I will do that
[11:19:18] <toddmparker> sure can
[11:19:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thanks
[11:19:42] <toddmparker> i can give you the twitter login too
[11:19:49] <toddmparker> you should have it!
[11:19:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok
[11:20:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you have access to it?
[11:20:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you are good at Twitter !!
[11:20:24] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:20:55] <uGoMobi> so maybe good idea if we both can tweet from that account
[11:21:15] <agcolom> I do not have the jquerymobile twitter account (was that hte question?)
[11:21:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yup, that was the Q
[11:21:41] <toddmparker> happy to send the login to both of you
[11:21:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you think it's a good idea if we both can tweet from that account?
[11:21:55] <agcolom> yes, that's fine by me
[11:21:55] <uGoMobi> or 3 of us
[11:22:06] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:22:53] <uGoMobi> okay, last item that I added is Grunticon
[11:24:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker Scott and Andrew created a branch with Grunticon solution for SVG icons
[11:24:43] <uGoMobi> I will work on the implementation today and tomorrow
[11:25:20] <agcolom> (Is that Scott J?)^
[11:25:34] <uGoMobi> yeah, Scott Jehl, sorry
[11:26:05] <scottjehl__> heyo
[11:26:27] <scottjehl__> I don' think the icons are wired-in. Just added to the repo
[11:26:33] <agcolom> hey scottjehl__ :-)
[11:26:34] <uGoMobi> hey scottjehl__
[11:26:34] <scottjehl__> don't*
[11:26:49] <uGoMobi> okay
[11:27:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker and I discussed the way to implement this
[11:27:47] <toddmparker> we have a few options
[11:28:00] <agcolom> just for the record, to everyone called Scott on the jQuery project: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BNtloMkCMAQuNd6.jpg:large
[11:28:01] <toddmparker> but scottjehl__ will be the best person to help uGoMobi
[11:28:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: lol
[11:29:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you followed the convo about this on IRC as well (during Portland conf)
[11:29:28] <arschmitz> yea
[11:29:30] <uGoMobi> about performance vs. avoid too much fuzz
[11:29:43] <arschmitz> yup i saw the convo you and todd had the other day too
[11:29:50] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:30:26] <scottjehl__> 2 basic options are: a) use the Grunticon loader snippet standalone, dropped into the head of each template (this loads the icons soonest and keeps the css urls easy to edit) b) integrate  the loader logic into jQM and offer url config via the init event pattern (requires waiting for jq and jqm to load before icons can be requested)
[11:31:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i liked your idea to support both through download builder
[11:31:30] <uGoMobi> we are going for option b)
[11:31:52] <uGoMobi> but make it possible to do option a) by excluding the snippet in the download builder
[11:32:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats what i saw you discussing that i liked
[11:32:32] <toddmparker> makes sense to me
[11:32:43] <scottjehl__> oh - also the snippet offers a non-js fallback via noscript.
[11:32:44] <uGoMobi> what's the best way t handle this "requires waiting for jq and jqm to load before icons can be requested"
[11:32:54] <scottjehl__> can't js-write that in of course
[11:32:55] <uGoMobi> scottjehl__: great!
[11:33:27] <toddmparker> but that no script requires that a no script tag is in the markup
[11:33:36] <scottjehl__> right
[11:33:37] <uGoMobi> right
[11:33:45] <toddmparker> so if we rolled this into the lib, you'd lose that
[11:33:55] <scottjehl__> so this is the loader js portion https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/tasks/grunticon/static/grunticon.loader.js
[11:33:57] <toddmparker> or we advice people to still add that
[11:34:25] <scottjehl__> full snippet looks like this
[11:34:25] <scottjehl__> https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/example/output/grunticon.loader.txt
[11:34:55] <arschmitz> i think integrating makes sense for default cdn and stuff but should have demos saying this is the better way to do it but you need to do it yourself
[11:35:23] <toddmparker> so if we went with the option to include the loader in the lib files, we could recommend people add this to their pages: <noscript><link href="/example/output/icons.fallback.css" rel="stylesheet"></noscript>
[11:35:33] <toddmparker> that right?
[11:36:41] <scottjehl__> yeah, and they'd have to configure that url to match the others too
[11:37:33] <uGoMobi> scottjehl__: huh, not sure what you mean
[11:37:44] <uGoMobi> the other 2 CSS files?
[11:37:58] <scottjehl__> so in the txt above, there are 3 potential css files to load
[11:38:01] <scottjehl__> via js
[11:38:11] <uGoMobi> but how does that work without the JS?
[11:38:25] <toddmparker> the no script
[11:38:26] <scottjehl__> those urls need to be configured. plus the fallback noscript element's css path as well, of course
[11:38:48] <scottjehl__> you can see in the txt that the urls are passed into that loader js
[11:39:40] <scottjehl__> I guess we could have these overridable in mobileinit or iconloaderbeforecreate, or something like that
[11:39:51] <uGoMobi> ah, you mean that you have to cofigure 4 url's in total
[11:40:02] <uGoMobi> 3 in the JS and 1 in the noscript
[11:40:03] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: so will will this be able to work pure cdn the way it can now?
[11:40:12] <scottjehl__> svgdatacss, pngdatacss, pngcss, fallbackcss
[11:40:18] <arschmitz> or will they need to be local?
[11:40:20] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[11:40:26] <scottjehl__> sure they can all be full urls
[11:41:03] <arschmitz> so this will just be a 100% required configuration step now?
[11:41:24] <arschmitz> because the paths are not relative to the css they are relative to the document
[11:43:04] <scottjehl__> same as any css theme link, but yeah
[11:43:21] <arschmitz> ok
[11:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> So there's no JS config value that needs to be set?
[11:43:52] <scottjehl__> definitely will be, yeah
[11:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> That seems like it could be a deal breaker for UI.
[11:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> Which in turn should mean it's a deal breaker for Mobile.
[11:44:22] <scottjehl__> goal is to dynamically load one of 3 css files based on feature support
[11:44:53] <scottjehl__> each containing data uri'd icons of different formats. svg data uris being ideal
[11:45:07] <scottjehl__> why's it a deal breaker?
[11:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> Requiring users to set config to get icons to work seems terrible.
[11:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> It's not at all how users are accustomed to working with CSS.
[11:46:05] <toddmparker> icon fonts have similar complexity, there are multiple formats
[11:46:08] <scottjehl__> totally open to alternate ways to get fully scalable icons that work everywhere (I know of none, though)
[11:46:17] <toddmparker> but they don't even have fallbacks
[11:46:55] <toddmparker> they only thing that will work like it does now is what we have now - png sprites
[11:47:36] <uGoMobi> right, and users want SVG
[11:47:39] <scottjehl__> it could default to hitting the cdn icon urls without an override
[11:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> What about SVG built into the stylsheet with fallbacks to PNG (not inlined).
[11:48:06] <toddmparker> the default can just include the icon loader in the lib and point to the cdn stylesheets
[11:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> Add a class to the body on load to trigger the PNG fallback.
[11:48:13] <toddmparker> so it won't be very different from now
[11:48:13] <scottjehl__> svg goes to waste in that case
[11:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> Only on old IE, right?
[11:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> And we double up on the rules in the stylesheet.
[11:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> But that doesn't seem like it should add up too much.
[11:48:41] <scottjehl__> android 2.3 (most popular version still)
[11:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> How large is the inline SVG for all the mobile icons?
[11:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> after gzip
[11:49:28] <scottjehl__> 9kb I think (down from 20 or so via png sprite)
[11:49:34] <toddmparker> or less
[11:49:43] <toddmparker> thought i was closer to 7-8k
[11:49:53] <uGoMobi> is that with the 50 new icons?
[11:49:59] <toddmparker> yep
[11:50:00] <scottjehl__> but external png isn't the first fallback
[11:50:04] <scottjehl__> png data uris are
[11:50:04] <uGoMobi> 50 in total
[11:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine if there's a way to opt-in for a more complex setup.
[11:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> Which has no unnecessary overhead.
[11:50:40] <scottjehl__> external request pngs only happen for non svg and non data uri browsers
[11:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> But I think the default should be config-free and optimized as best we can.
[11:50:51] <toddmparker> unless we want to offer 50 in black and 50 in white = 100 = ~16k-18k
[11:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> data URI SVGs with a fallback to external png sprite seems like a sane default.
[11:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> It gives the vast majority of users the best experience, with slight extra overhead for the png rules.
[11:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> And it will work everywhere.
[11:52:41] <toddmparker> discussing...
[11:52:55] <scott_gonzalez> The biggest downside is the unnecessary SVG data being sent to the older/slower devices.
[11:53:03] <arschmitz> i think i tend to agree with scott_gonzalez on this right now there is no required setup for mobile or ui and adding it seems weird to me
[11:53:44] <uGoMobi> it doesn't seem weird to me, just different
[11:53:49] <scottjehl__> even if we combine these to one stylesheet, there's still a css url to figure out, right?
[11:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> Again, I'm fine if there's a way for users to choose that they want to set a config and avoid any unnecessary overhead.
[11:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> scottjehl__: It'd just be a single stylesheet, so they'd include it in their markup just like they're doing now.
[11:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> You were already planning on an option in download builder to decide whether you get the loader.
[11:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> So you can have users choose to use the loader, include the noscript stylesheet in their markup, and set a config value via js.
[11:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> And you can still ship the optimized stylesheets and the JS loader will pick the correct one.
[11:56:10] <scottjehl__> k. you'd get another blocking request that way (current request is async to let the ui spin up as soon as possible)
[11:57:23] <scott_gonzalez> It's not any worse performance wise than what everyone is doing today though, is it?
[11:57:46] <toddmparker> so if we have a single stylesheet with svg data uri's and the png rules w/refs to external files
[11:57:59] <scottjehl__> guess not. was sort of hoping to make this one of many steps to make the framework spin up faster than it already does
[11:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can still encourage people to do that.
[11:58:15] <toddmparker> if you didn't support svg, you download 50 svg uri's you don't need + 50 individual png files
[11:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> But I think out of the box, you shouldn't have to set a config value.
[11:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> Wouldn't it be 1 png sprite?
[11:58:53] <scottjehl__> no
[11:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> You'd still load the 50 SVG URIs, which is ~8k, right?
[11:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> Why isn't the png a sprite?
[11:59:07] <toddmparker> right now, we avoid the ugliness of sprites
[11:59:17] <toddmparker> and the need for extra containers
[11:59:38] <scottjehl__> separate icons mean designing without the constraints of sprite bleeding and such
[11:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> (if this is killing the meeting agenda we can move this to -dev)
[11:59:52] <toddmparker> eau, maybe we should. don't want to dominate...
[11:59:54] <scottjehl__> so it'd be hard to start there and fall back to sprite
[12:00:27] <scottjehl__> k so the css would be like... .iconfoo { background: svgdatauri; } .no-svgsupport .iconfoo { background: externalpngurl; }  ?
[12:00:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok, that makes sense
[12:00:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:00:47] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have a sense of how many icons people actually use on average?
[12:00:51] <scottjehl__> I'm okay with this
[12:01:22] <scottjehl__> downside is considerable though: android 2.3 will make tons of png requests with this pattern
[12:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I thought this was going to be a sprite so it'd be a single request.
[12:01:39] <scottjehl__> as will IE7, Opera Mini Todd?
[12:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> The downside is definitely larger than I had originally thought.
[12:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> Opera Mini has SVG support
[12:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> At least back to 5.0
[12:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> Current is 7.0
[12:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://caniuse.com/#search=svg
[12:02:19] <uGoMobi> IE7 will become C-grade
[12:02:21] <scottjehl__> we can check the tests Todd did to get the clear line
[12:02:26] <scottjehl__> good point
[12:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> Same for data URI support
[12:02:32] <scottjehl__> (both)
[12:02:55] <uGoMobi> but Android 2.3 might be an issue
[12:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> So it's basically Android 2.3 and IE8 that will take the hit.
[12:03:09] <scottjehl__> hate that platform so much
[12:03:17] <uGoMobi> ok shall we continue this on -dev in a few minutes?
[12:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> Android 2.3 seems like a much bigger concerns.
[12:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> Considered the hardware it's likely to be running on and the connection speed.
[12:03:50] <scottjehl__> right: IE8 not 7
[12:04:00] <scottjehl__> pngs for 8 as well I mean
[12:04:51] <scottjehl__> we could consider sprite fallbacks. I mean, we control the icon placement and markup so maybe we can try it out and see what issues arise
[12:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> So, in terms of stats, 2.3 is the most popular, but it's not more popular than 4+ combined.
[12:05:30] <toddmparker> true, just tipped
[12:05:38] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yes 2.3 is 38% 4.x is 60%
[12:05:39] <toddmparker> but it's like 450 million
[12:05:47] <toddmparker> ok, so 380 million on 2.x
[12:06:22] <arschmitz> pretty substantial
[12:06:55] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> Where are these stats coming from?
[12:07:34] <uGoMobi> android dashboard
[12:07:37] <arschmitz> http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/android-jelly-bean-marketshare-overtakes-ice-cream-sandwich-gingerbread-still-going-strong-361920 is where i got mine
[12:08:15] <uGoMobi> alright, let's continue this discussion on -dev
[12:08:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you added two agenda items
[12:08:52] <scottjehl__> If we went the sprite route, we'd need to automate that from the svgs somehow (via phantom or whatever)
[12:08:57] <arschmitz> yup both very quick
[12:09:13] <johnbender> the dashboard could be considered optimistic too since it's play store contact
[12:09:17] <uGoMobi> (ignore "test devices" as agenda item, that should have bee an update from me)
[12:09:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and i discussed a process for large commits
[12:09:51] <uGoMobi> johnbender: good point
[12:09:59] <toddmparker> stats? i believe android is 900million
[12:10:06] <toddmparker> opera mini = 200m
[12:10:22] <arschmitz> that anything more then trivial should be done as a pr and have at least one other team member review before merge
[12:10:47] <arschmitz> just to make sure we are getting more then one set of eyes on any big changes
[12:11:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, I agree
[12:12:01] <arschmitz> and just a quick update on pointer event support
[12:12:53] <arschmitz> have talked with kborchers about this quite a bit and we should not make any real changes to support it until they finish their work with polymer
[12:13:06] <arschmitz> WP8 supports full mouse events
[12:13:20] <arschmitz> so it "mostly" works with vmouse plugin
[12:13:31] <uGoMobi> okay
[12:13:35] <arschmitz> i say mostly because we need to add one css rule to slider to make it work correctly
[12:13:57] <arschmitz> other then that everything works already in WP8
[12:14:23] <uGoMobi> and Windows RT?
[12:14:36] <arschmitz> i dont have an RT device but it should be the same
[12:14:49] <toddmparker> we bought on at filament so i can test RT stuff
[12:14:59] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:15:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok ill send you a link todd
[12:15:13] <toddmparker> great
[12:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, IE11 should have more spec compliant events too :-)
[12:15:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you make that CSS change?
[12:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't tested out the pre-release yet though.
[12:15:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not yet wanted to check with you first
[12:15:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, we can discuss on -dev
[12:15:56] <arschmitz> yup
[12:16:07] <arschmitz> i just wanted to let everyone know where that landed
[12:16:19] <arschmitz> thats it for me
[12:16:27] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[12:16:54] <uGoMobi> anyone else has something that needs to be discussed here during the meeting?
[12:17:22] <uGoMobi> or any questions from the community?
[12:17:59] <agcolom> at some point I'd like help with the docs... I'd need someone to go through the methods and check signatures
[12:18:11] <agcolom> and the same with events
[12:18:14] <agcolom> please :-)
[12:19:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok
[12:20:11] <agcolom> maybe sometime early next week would be good...
[12:21:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I can help with that next week
[12:21:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Fantastic! Thank you!
[12:21:27] <uGoMobi> and I will ask the others for help if I am not sure about something :)
[12:22:41] <uGoMobi> ok, let's wrap up
[12:23:06] <uGoMobi> thanks everyone
