[09:01:37] <tj_vantoll> yo
[09:01:38] <kborchers> yo
[09:01:52] <rxaviers> hello
[09:02:03] <gnarf> hey
[09:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to start with download builder updates?
[09:03:14] <rxaviers> Sure...
[09:04:06] <rxaviers> We have a PR with the pre-req work for (a) cutoff duplicate parts - which is importing release script from UI to db, (b) support 1.11
[09:04:11] <rxaviers> It's the https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/146
[09:04:52] <rxaviers> I wait for feedback of this PR. In the meanwhile, I am working on the 'release script import' and '1.11 support'.
[09:06:11] <mikesherov> hi
[09:06:19] <rxaviers> (both work-in-progress code not pushed to a branch yet)
[09:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:06:30] <rxaviers> basically, that's it
[09:07:11] <rxaviers> As soon as we close the first PR above, the less the risk of rework on what I doing now
[09:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> There's not much on the agenda today.
[09:07:26] <rxaviers> I am*
[09:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll try to land this soon.
[09:07:57] <rxaviers> \o/
[09:08:22] <mikesherov> should I land the "effects split out" PR?
[09:08:36] <mikesherov> I got up to it this morning
[09:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/981
[09:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think that can land.
[09:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to update the commit message to reference the ticket.
[09:10:04] <rxaviers> well remembered
[09:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> We landed some theming updates on api.jqueryui.com.
[09:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> We now have docs for icons and .ui-front.
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> Individual widget theming is the only thing left: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/144
[09:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> As you can see, tj_vantoll is already workig on it.
[09:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Now that DaveMethvin is back, we should discuss which testing framework to use for pointer events.
[09:12:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you, DaveMethvin and i need to talk pointer testing at some point. i started looking at selenium webdriver, webdriverjs and mocha. seems like that could be a good solution. i can start putting together some pointerdown tests to see how it might work for us either before or after we talk
[09:12:19] <kborchers> :)
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> Wouldn't hurt to just start working on it.
[09:13:51] <kborchers> ok, will do â€¦ it'll give us something tangible to look at when discussing
[09:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:15:37] <mikesherov> nothing else to report
[09:15:39] <mikesherov> plugging along
[09:16:07] <mikesherov> our bug count has stagnated, but should start going down again as I land these PR's
[09:16:22] <mikesherov> stevenluscher is pretty good, we should reach out to him to fix more bugs
[09:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've been focused on docs recently.
[09:16:51] <mikesherov> no worries, between you, tj and I, bugs are under control, just not really decreasing recently
[09:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> But on top of that, we've had an increase in bug reports recently.
[09:16:59] <mikesherov> right
[09:17:04] <mikesherov> Oh, I did have one question
[09:17:11] <mikesherov> did you ever figure out that regression I introduced?
[09:17:23] <mikesherov> can you assign the ticket to me if you didn't
[09:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had time to investigate it.
[09:17:47] <tj_vantoll> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9315
[09:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> Trac is so slow...
[09:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it's assigned to you now.
[09:19:53] <tj_vantoll> Well we probably had a whole 3 people visit the same page within a few seconds of each other :)
[09:20:56] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think that's it.
[09:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> See everyone back in -dev.
[11:03:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez ryanneufeld Krinkle jzaefferer mikesherov s5fs clarkbox: anyone have any infra topics?
[11:03:45] <clarkbox> I'm around. don't have anything
[11:04:01] <gnarf> clarkbox: is logging working again?
[11:04:05] <clarkbox> it is
[11:04:14] <gnarf> awesome
[11:04:21] <clarkbox> have not had time to hook up html. its easy enough. just have not got around to it
[11:04:33] <gnarf> can you try to tackle that today?
[11:04:34] <clarkbox> but if you see jqlog in channel, its logging to disk
[11:04:53] <clarkbox> I'm pretty slammed with work and life. ill do what i can
[11:08:42] <gnarf> k
