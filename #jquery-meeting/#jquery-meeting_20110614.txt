[11:09:05] <eddiemonge> yay
[11:09:07] <gseguin> good morning
[11:09:21] <todd_> Thanks ajpiano!
[11:09:30] <todd_> Hi all
[11:09:37] <kinblas> hey-oh
[11:09:38] <gseguin> aloha!
[11:09:56] <todd_> We're going to have a very brief, 15 minute checkin for the jQuery Mobile team today to huddle on to-dos for neta 1
[11:09:59] <todd_> beta 1
[11:10:29] <todd_> Our meeting will be moved to Thursdays at 2:00pm EST / 11:00am PST going forward
[11:10:38] <todd_> We'll have a quick meeting at that time this week
[11:11:17] <todd_> No formal agenda, just wanted everyone to gather and give quick updates on where they are
[11:11:33] <todd_> Big news: the nav changes kinblas was working all landed last night!
[11:11:41] <todd_> kinblas - want to give a quick update?
[11:11:55] <kinblas> Sure, my changes landed last night.
[11:12:06] <kinblas> Things look good in the normal browser case
[11:12:48] <kinblas> I'm currently testing Phone Gap for 2 specific cases, loading an application from (file:// normal case) and loading urls from the server; and the case where we load the app file from file:// but have a base tag set for server
[11:13:12] <kinblas> it's going Sloooooooow because of the android emulator
[11:13:29] <kinblas> after the meeting I need to switch to Mac so I can test on iOS to get going a bit faster
[11:13:47] <todd_> so far so good with file URLs
[11:13:48] <kinblas> the android emulator isn't cutting it today even with 8gb of ram
[11:14:04] <kinblas> Right, so the goal was to enforce
[11:14:12] <todd_> These changes cover the URL and basetag code for those listening in
[11:14:13] <kinblas> the hash policy of element id or site relative paths
[11:14:30] <kinblas> while at the same time supporting relative variants
[11:14:37] <kinblas> and preserving query strings
[11:14:39] <kinblas> etc
[11:14:51] <kinblas> in other words, not mangling the urls folks use
[11:15:07] <kinblas> some loose ends
[11:15:30] <kinblas> right now the navigation code tracks documentUrl and documentBase as private variables
[11:15:38] <kinblas> I'm assuming we want to expose those for developers?
[11:15:49] <kinblas> via the $.mobile.path namespace object?
[11:16:15] <scottjehl> hi
[11:16:16] <scottjehl> sorry
[11:16:21] <scottjehl> looks like I can chat now :)
[11:16:30] <kinblas> 2nd loose end ... I need to make the change we talked about yesterday regarding resolving changePage() direct calls against the URL used to load the active page
[11:16:31] <todd_> hi scottjehl
[11:16:43] <kinblas> right now it resolves it against the base
[11:16:52] <kinblas> documentBase that is
[11:17:12] <todd_> scottjehl - want to weigh in here? For #1, definitely
[11:17:35] <todd_> BTW - I just pushed a blog post outlining these new changes: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/06/14/jquery-mobile-update-week-of-june-13/
[11:17:56] <kinblas> One thing I should point out  for folks writing code that takes apart Urls
[11:18:08] <kinblas> I wrote a regexp Url parser
[11:18:15] <kinblas> that can break the url into pieces
[11:18:25] <todd_> I saw that. Mad code Kin
[11:18:27] <kinblas> this is important because devs use ?/# in hashes
[11:18:51] <todd_> Right
[11:18:53] <kinblas> if you aren't careful, you may delete or pull in the wrong pieces of an url if your regexp isn't correct
[11:19:02] <kinblas> so use the urlParser
[11:19:11] <todd_> So at this stage, we just want people to test the new nav code for a few days to see if we missed anything
[11:19:43] <kinblas> right
[11:19:49] <todd_> we should document the features devs can use in the new nav stuff for beta
[11:20:09] <kinblas> ok, where?
[11:20:11] <todd_> kin - would you be able to add a page in demos & docs for the nav stuff
[11:20:17] <scottjehl> catching up
[11:20:18] <todd_> Under API?
[11:20:21] <scottjehl> looking for #1
[11:20:39] <todd_> right now the navigation code tracks documentUrl and documentBase as private variables
[11:20:39] <todd_> I'm assuming we want to expose those for developers?
[11:20:39] <todd_> via the $.mobile.path namespace object?
[11:21:25] <todd_> ...that is #1 scottjehl
[11:21:28] <scottjehl> hmm
[11:21:45] <scottjehl> so would those be page data?
[11:21:57] <kinblas> ??
[11:21:58] <scottjehl> $(mypage).data( "documentUrl" )
[11:22:05] <kinblas> oh no no
[11:22:10] <scottjehl> would they be data-attrs per page?
[11:22:17] <scottjehl> ...would that be useful?
[11:22:27] <kinblas> jqm tracks at startup what the documentUrl is and what the documentBase is because they could be different
[11:22:48] <scottjehl> oh ok. this isn't a dynamic thing
[11:22:54] <kinblas> right
[11:22:56] <scottjehl> sure. expose em :)
[11:23:20] <todd_> for #2?
[11:23:22] <scottjehl> well, expose for setting?
[11:23:26] <scottjehl> or just for getting?
[11:23:31] <kinblas> they aren't something devs set
[11:23:36] <kinblas> but more of an informational thing.
[11:23:38] <todd_> so just getters?
[11:23:39] <kinblas> for example
[11:23:41] <scottjehl> $.mobile.getDocUrl()
[11:23:51] <scottjehl> but not expose the var?
[11:23:51] <kinblas> they can't just grab the base tag to see what the document base is because we change it all the time
[11:24:25] <kinblas> scottjehl: perhaps we can add getDocUrl() and have it return the parsed object
[11:24:28] <kinblas> so folks can do stuff like
[11:24:33] <kinblas> getDocUrl().protocol
[11:24:44] <kinblas> getDocUrl().href
[11:24:46] <kinblas> or whatever
[11:25:10] <kinblas> I was just thinking of doing something like:
[11:25:21] <scottjehl> yeah
[11:25:21] <kinblas> path.documentUrl = documentUrl.href;
[11:25:32] <kinblas> path.documentBase = documentBase.href;
[11:25:39] <kinblas> but if you want fancier api we can
[11:25:52] <scottjehl> well I was just thinking exposing the property will allow for setting right?
[11:25:56] <scottjehl> probably don't want that
[11:26:08] <kinblas> yeah ok, we'll use accessors
[11:26:17] <kinblas> but scoped to $.mobile.path right?
[11:26:20] <kinblas> like all the other stuff?
[11:26:33] <kinblas> or hmmm, nevermind that's just path utils
[11:26:42] <scottjehl> sure. whatever works
[11:26:50] <kinblas> ok
[11:26:56] <scottjehl> does path have private props too?
[11:27:01] <scottjehl> or is it all exposed?
[11:27:03] <scottjehl> and is that fine
[11:27:03] <kinblas> it used to
[11:27:04] <scottjehl> ?
[11:27:06] <kinblas> path.origin
[11:27:09] <kinblas> but I got rid of that
[11:27:16] <scottjehl> k
[11:27:30] <kinblas> _nickel: hola
[11:27:32] <scottjehl> so yeah, sounds good
[11:27:43] <kinblas> ok I'll add that today
[11:27:44] <_nickel> kinblas: hey
[11:27:54] <_nickel> kinblas: pure happenstance I'm online
[11:28:01] <_nickel> just answering an email then I'm hopping off :D
[11:28:05] <scottjehl> kinblas: about #2
[11:28:09] <todd_> hey _nickel
[11:28:30] <scottjehl> (hey _nickel!)
[11:28:44] <scottjehl> is that just a matter of removing the logic that tells it not to use the current path?
[11:29:27] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah #2 is a one liner where I call a utility method that checks the .ui-page for a data-url, if it has one and isn't an id then it uses that as the url to resolve against, other-wise it uses the document base.
[11:29:39] <kinblas> one-liner, but I have to run the unit tests to make sure it doesn't bust something unexpected
[11:30:01] <scottjehl> k nice
[11:30:03] <scottjehl> not major
[11:30:08] * kinblas is groovin' on the unit tests as a sanity check
[11:30:12] <scottjehl> awesome work, kin
[11:30:20] <kinblas> that's it from my end
[11:30:29] <todd_> great. _nickel would be proud of all the new tests
[11:30:40] <scottjehl> that regexp is something of wizards
[11:30:54] <kinblas> todd_: _nickel's last set of changes (pageSequence) makes things much much easier
[11:30:56] <_nickel> todd_: true facts
[11:30:57] <_nickel> :D
[11:31:18] <todd_> so now that nav is in, we can let people bang on it for a few days
[11:31:34] <kinblas> is pushstate post beta 1?
[11:31:45] <todd_> yep
[11:31:59] <todd_> for beta 2, we should try to get that in tho
[11:32:08] <scottjehl> YES
[11:32:10] <todd_> that right scottehl
[11:32:13] <kinblas> ok, I was just asking for test purposes
[11:32:21] <kinblas> testing phonegap is hard cause there's no location bar
[11:32:23] <scottjehl> yeah, gonna need your help on that one :)
[11:32:33] <scottjehl> I got it pretty close. we'll need to work out the details
[11:32:49] <kinblas> cool
[11:32:51] <todd_> gseguin, you here?
[11:32:56] <gseguin> yup
[11:32:59] <eddiemonge> speaking of location bar, is there a way to get rid of it completely on page transitions?
[11:33:02] <scottjehl> pretty close = works in chrome, firefox
[11:33:02] <todd_> oh, hi
[11:33:07] <scottjehl> not ios yet
[11:33:16] <gseguin> hi
[11:33:22] <eddiemonge> and the page transitions need work i think. the loading image appears to appear at the wrong time
[11:33:23] <scottjehl> eddiemonge: it's tricky
[11:33:32] <todd_> looking at al the page transition stuff should maybe be next on kin's list
[11:33:43] <scottjehl> we've tried. but yeah, we're looking at that for B2
[11:33:50] <todd_> i'd like that to be as slick as possible for beta 2
[11:34:04] <scottjehl> getting the bar not to drop at all is something we've had limited luck with
[11:34:05] <eddiemonge> someone told (but havent tried) that if you do link instead of href the bar doesnt popup
[11:34:08] <gseguin> todd_: I just picked up issue 1825: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1825
[11:34:28] <todd_> you're fast!
[11:34:30] <scottjehl> "that if you do link instead of href the bar doesnt popup" right... the problem is we use real links
[11:34:37] <scottjehl> if you call that a problem :)
[11:35:02] <todd_> maybe in the hijack we can do some funny bizness?
[11:35:12] <todd_> seems like hackery tho
[11:35:13] <scottjehl> not sure what to do there. we could script against something else after page load, but hrefs are good for other reasons
[11:35:16] <scottjehl> a11y
[11:35:35] * kinblas isn't following the difference between link and href
[11:35:39] <scottjehl> ...right click to open a new tab
[11:35:42] <todd_> i like that browsers are slowly getting more standards compliant so we can be less hack-y
[11:36:10] <scottjehl> Eddie, it's that the href itself causes it right? remove that and no address bar drop?
[11:36:23] <eddiemonge> i think thats it
[11:36:29] <scottjehl> removing href causes tons of keyboard access issues
[11:36:49] <eddiemonge> we could just do that for ios, although i really hate that idea
[11:37:00] <scottjehl> stackoverflow has some anchors without hrefs, they don't receive focus
[11:37:07] <eddiemonge> i hate being os/browser specific
[11:37:32] <todd_> let's start collecting ideas for the page transition smooth-out: CSS transitions, URL bar drop, focus and scroll jump
[11:37:42] <todd_> lots of topics to cover there :)
[11:37:46] <scottjehl> I'm mostly concerned about removing features that browsers depend upon. href allows all sorts of nice behavior
[11:38:03] <todd_> ...we can pick this up later
[11:38:11] <todd_> quick question on this new issue:
[11:38:12] <todd_> When transition is set to none, it hangs after the transition is complete on desktop chrome. This issue is only present is the latest revision from github and not a4.1 itself.
[11:38:13] <kinblas> scottjehl: eddiemonge: maybe later you guys can explain to me what the difference between link and href are that you are talking about on dev channel
[11:38:15] <eddiemonge> wiki it lol
[11:38:21] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1822
[11:38:36] <eddiemonge> kinblas: its about ios url bar dropping down and how to prevent it
[11:39:06] <todd_> kinblas - you want this one?
[11:39:06] <scottjehl> fwiw, sencha's clickables are divs. That's why they don't have this issue
[11:39:11] <kinblas> todd_: I can look at that
[11:39:16] <todd_> let's make the switch!
[11:39:24] <todd_> kinblas - coolio
[11:39:37] <todd_> seems like a quick one
[11:39:50] <scottjehl> anchors to divs?
[11:39:59] <scottjehl> heh. we can take this discussion offline ;)
[11:40:05] <todd_> ok, tagged to you
[11:40:07] <eddiemonge> yeah thats a big discussion
[11:40:11] <todd_> way offline
[11:40:21] <todd_> like i never want to hear about div links again
[11:40:21] <scottjehl> yeah like off the whatever line I'll ever be found on
[11:40:25] <kinblas> todd_: that bug lacks details too
[11:40:28] <kinblas> I added a comment
[11:40:48] <todd_> ah, good question
[11:41:13] <gseguin> kinblas: he just closed the issue
[11:41:17] <todd_> kinblas - this would be another that you might want to look at
[11:41:18] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1821
[11:41:22] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1803
[11:41:25] <gseguin> that was a quick one!
[11:41:34] <kinblas> todd_: he closed probably by accident, I do that all the time
[11:41:47] <gseguin> yep, reopened
[11:41:52] <todd_> yeah, i hate that comment & close button
[11:41:56] <todd_> grrr
[11:42:03] <kinblas> they need to swap the order of those buttons
[11:42:05] <todd_> eddiemonge - you want us to pull that in?
[11:42:07] <kinblas> or make it a checkbox option to close
[11:42:10] <todd_> yeah
[11:42:16] <eddiemonge> todd_: yeah its php changes.
[11:42:18] <todd_> horrible ui
[11:42:30] <todd_> i don't mind hitting 2 buttons: close and comment
[11:42:32] <todd_> k
[11:42:48] <todd_> eddiemonge - pulled in
[11:42:50] <eddiemonge> cleans up php in the source and removes the closing php tags which arent needed
[11:43:09] <todd_> eddiemonge - any update on the docs template?
[11:43:22] <todd_> i really want to see if we can get some volunteers filling that out ASAP
[11:43:42] <eddiemonge> im going to work on it this tomorrow and friday. im trying to rope in some more of the design team to help me
[11:45:17] <todd_> ok, thanks!
[11:45:30] <eddiemonge> with the exception of line 8 (which i cant changes since the branch seems tohave disappeared from my repo) thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1802/files
[11:45:34] <todd_> i think just having the basic markup syntax down is the most important thing right now
[11:46:34] <todd_> eddiemonge - that seems ok to me
[11:46:36] <scottjehl> looks good. but yeah that demo url throws me off
[11:46:38] <todd_> except for 8
[11:46:41] <todd_> +http://jquerymobile.com/demos/
[11:46:45] <todd_> ...doesn't exist
[11:46:59] <todd_> or we shouldn't point people to /demos/
[11:47:00] <scottjehl> we can pull that in and then change the url back to test/
[11:47:27] <scottjehl> right that's the major point. /demos/ isn't our test url.
[11:47:32] <eddiemonge> the thing with /demos is that it points to the folder that is named the same as what is in version.txt
[11:47:33] <todd_> yeah
[11:47:43] <todd_> it's just confusing tho
[11:47:48] <todd_> it's the same as /latest/
[11:47:48] <eddiemonge> which i dont think should get updated until we are actually at that version
[11:49:05] <scottjehl> oh so that's supposed to be latest release?
[11:49:09] <scottjehl> not just latest nightly?
[11:50:03] <eddiemonge> yeah /demo and /demos are supposed to point to the latest 'stable' release
[11:50:25] <eddiemonge>  /test points to the latest uncompiled from git
[11:50:43] <eddiemonge> and /latest shortcut to the blog post about the CDN versions
[11:51:36] <todd_> makes sense
[11:51:56] <todd_> except does /demo/ resolve in the URL bar to 4.1 or whatever
[11:52:03] <todd_> a redirect essentailly
[11:52:08] <eddiemonge> yeah
[11:52:12] <todd_> ok then
[11:52:55] <todd_> makes sense to me
[11:53:11] <todd_> ok, we've gone long so any other items to discuss today?
[11:53:25] <todd_> just keep trying to close criticals and blockers int he next 2 days
[11:53:28] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1801/files
[11:53:42] <eddiemonge> this isnt critical but should be addressed at some point
[11:53:46] <todd_> we can decide whether beta goes out at the end of the week or Monday
[11:53:55] <eddiemonge> scottjehl suggested dropping grid altogether
[11:54:08] <eddiemonge> i agree since its just a convenience class adder at the moment
[11:54:27] <scottjehl> yeah... only one plugin uses it
[11:54:34] <todd_> i think i'd rather leave grid alone for now but definiely replace it when we start building the responsive stuff in
[11:54:42] <scottjehl> I'd rather not see anyone latch onto it externally
[11:54:56] <kinblas> so then how are buttons going to be layed out in the demos?
[11:55:00] <todd_> i think some people are using it already for sure
[11:55:04] <scottjehl> this is all post B1 anyway
[11:55:06] <todd_> i see forum and issues related to grids
[11:55:09] <todd_> yeah
[11:55:09] <scottjehl> we can talk later about it
[11:55:19] <eddiemonge> with the exception of js/jquery.mobile.grid.js  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1800/files cleans up the markup
[11:55:19] <todd_> post b1 or even 1.0.
[11:55:19] <scottjehl> I have to run
[11:55:27] <todd_> ok all, let's wrap it up
[11:55:27] <scottjehl> anything else for me?
[11:55:39] <todd_> don't think so. anyone?
[11:55:46] <gseguin> nothing here
[11:56:03] <todd_> i'll try to look for any other issues that we shouls try  o tackle for b1
[11:56:21] <todd_> feel free to bump anything up that is bad news
[11:57:42] <kinblas> todd_: Just wanted to make sure wp7 looks good for you guys right? I don't have a wp7 device, only IE7
[11:59:19] <todd_> it seems to work well excpt scott noticed a bad issue with radios and checkboxes
[11:59:23] <todd_> recent regression
[11:59:45] <scottjehl> i'll take a look at that in th emonign
[11:59:58] <kinblas> ok, hopefully not my fault?
[12:00:00] <kinblas> :-)
[12:00:41] <scottjehl> thanks everyone!
[12:00:44] <scottjehl> gotta run
[12:02:24] <kinblas> todd_: so is that it for the meeting?
[12:03:27] <gseguin> are we the only 2 left? :P
[12:03:33] <kinblas> heh
[12:05:09] <eddiemonge> hmm
[12:06:22] <todd_> I just added a WP7 radio/check issue
[12:06:24] <todd_> so 3
[12:06:33] <todd_> kinblas - is this closed? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1778
[12:07:09] <todd_> actually, let me close this meeting and we'll continue on -dev
