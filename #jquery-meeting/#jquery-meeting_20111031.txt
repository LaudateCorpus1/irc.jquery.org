[09:03:46] <addyosmani> hey guys
[09:03:52] <kswedberg> hi
[09:04:39] <timmywil> bienvenido
[09:04:50] <DaveMethvin> finally i can say what i think
[09:06:43] <DaveMethvin> ok, agenda for today (10/31) is updated
[09:07:02] <addyosmani> coolio
[09:07:19] <DaveMethvin> nothing really going on ... just a couple of BLOCKERS and a lot of missing docs :D
[09:07:29] <kswedberg> heh
[09:07:42] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/compare/master...bug_10613_2
[09:07:46] <timmywil> halloween blocker
[09:07:56] <DaveMethvin> detached head ... scary
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> so do you think you have a solution?
[09:08:21] <timmywil> yea
[09:08:34] <addyosmani> I can help with missing docs when we get to talking about that
[09:08:35] <timmywil> it no longer crashes and I think I've covered affecting any real styles
[09:08:40] <DaveMethvin> good, drive a stake through IE8's heart!
[09:08:46] <kswedberg> awesome, addyosmani. thanks!
[09:08:53] <addyosmani> anytime!
[09:09:04] <addyosmani> I'd like to take on the $.Callbacks() stuff. Maybe more depending on time
[09:09:22] <timmywil> after the meeting I'll push it and we'll see if testswarm ever crashes (but I don't think it will)
[09:09:32] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron says he'll take care of the other blocker, so  yeah lets move to docs after we nail down the schedule
[09:09:49] <DaveMethvin> if we can, let's get RC2 out this afternoon or evening
[09:09:59] <DaveMethvin> then give ppl at least a couple of days to find problems
[09:10:11] <DaveMethvin> notice how once we have an rc, people FINALLY start to test
[09:10:29] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: ping me when RC2 is out so I can start massive doc update
[09:10:36] <DaveMethvin> so i was thinking thursday for the release assuming no showstopper bugs
[09:10:49] <DaveMethvin> sound good?
[09:11:19] <kswedberg> seems reasonable
[09:11:26] <DaveMethvin> if so let's be sure we have the docs under control
[09:11:50] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg sounded like addyosmani could be suckered into callbacks
[09:12:03] <DaveMethvin> oh hi addy, didn't see you there! :)
[09:12:10] <addyosmani> suckered? I've been looking for some docs to get my teeth stuck into.
[09:12:21] <DaveMethvin> sweet as candy corn
[09:12:45] <kswedberg> addyosmani: awesome. I have a new post in there with some a skeleton (spooky!)
[09:12:56] <addyosmani> Ooooooh
[09:12:58] <addyosmani> awesome
[09:12:59] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: do you need any help on the docs items you took? I could do them if you're busy
[09:13:05] <addyosmani> I'll take a look at expanding them from there
[09:13:32] <addyosmani> brb
[09:13:35] <kswedberg> so have at it. addyosmani, there's no content â€¦ just some xml really. just wanted to get the entry in there for ya
[09:13:48] <timmywil> I can probably get to them tomorrow
[09:13:55] <timmywil> they are minor
[09:13:59] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: deferred.state is done. would appreciate your review.
[09:14:25] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: sure, i'll look in WP after the meeting, just ping me on other stuff
[09:14:35] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: dfd.state() doesn't depend on anything else docswise, so feel free to publish if it looks good
[09:14:49] <DaveMethvin> do we have an idea of where the AMD stuff would be documented?
[09:15:00] <kswedberg> NO IDEA
[09:15:01] <timmywil> hmmm
[09:15:08] <timmywil> in the blog post ? :P
[09:15:09] <kswedberg> was just wondering about that myself
[09:15:19] <kswedberg> let's put it in the blog post for now.
[09:15:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah that for sure, lemme make a note
[09:16:30] <kswedberg> k. like me note for deferred.state()? ;)
[09:17:12] <DaveMethvin> pending, har de har
[09:17:19] <kswedberg> :)
[09:17:28] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i moved your docs items to the clap
[09:17:37] <timmywil> k thx
[09:17:43] <kswedberg> so, we also need docs for dfd.notify(), dfd.notifyWith(), and dfd.progress() yes?
[09:18:00] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:18:03] <DaveMethvin> i can do those
[09:18:10] <kswedberg> awesome
[09:18:19] <kswedberg> timmywil: http://oksoclap.com/1-7-docs
[09:18:53] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then
[09:19:28] <DaveMethvin> looks like this may not be as scary as first thought
[09:20:03] <kswedberg> cool cool.
[09:20:53] <AddyosmanI> Can someone put me down for callbacks on the pad? It's not editing on mobile safari for some reason
[09:21:13] <kswedberg> AddyosmanI: done.
[09:21:28] <AddyosmanI> Thanks jawed erg
[09:21:38] <AddyosmanI> Thanks karl
[09:21:51] <kswedberg> who is jawed erg?!
[09:22:00] <AddyosmanI> Darn autocorrect :(
[09:22:04] <DaveMethvin> that's your name to autocorrect karl
[09:22:04] <timmywil> lol
[09:22:13] <kswedberg> love it!
[09:22:28] <DaveMethvin> really sounds more like a jaubourg nickname tho
[09:22:41] <kswedberg> that's what I was thinking.
[09:22:44] <DaveMethvin> oh and the other question, do these fixes reopen any tickets?
[09:23:17] <DaveMethvin> i forgot, had we documented anything about the offset properties being moved to .support?
[09:23:29] <DaveMethvin> i don't think they necessarily NEED to be documented at this point
[09:23:46] <timmywil> i just want jaubourg to see the support changes
[09:23:49] <kswedberg> explain? what would need to be documented there?
[09:24:07] <timmywil> jQuery.support.fixedPosition is worth documenting
[09:24:08] <DaveMethvin> we moved some of the offset-related feature detects to jQuery.support
[09:24:45] <timmywil> sry, .suppot.supportsFixedPosition
[09:24:47] <timmywil> ugh
[09:24:47] <kswedberg> ah ah. yeah.
[09:24:52] <timmywil> that's ugly
[09:24:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:25:12] <timmywil> hey! how bout we change the name of that
[09:25:17] <DaveMethvin> YEAH!
[09:25:24] <kswedberg> before it's too late!
[09:25:28] <timmywil> yea
[09:25:29] <DaveMethvin> unless IE8 crashes because of it
[09:25:35] <timmywil> lol
[09:25:39] <timmywil> we'll see
[09:25:41] <DaveMethvin> hey maybe it crashed b/c the name was too long
[09:25:56] <timmywil> probably
[09:26:21] <DaveMethvin> ok ... anything else? I think we have this almost kinda sorta under control
[09:27:08] <timmywil> also, do these need to be at jQuery.offset?
[09:27:09] <DaveMethvin> hmm google docs disconnected me
[09:27:19] <timmywil> cause we put them both in jQuery.offset and jQuery.support
[09:27:30] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: oh yeah maybe that's why we didn't change the name, just for simplicity
[09:27:43] <timmywil> well, can't offset reference support now?
[09:27:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah it could, true
[09:28:04] <DaveMethvin> it can lazy-copy over the value if it wanted
[09:28:10] <DaveMethvin> whatever is easiest
[09:28:59] <kswedberg> nothing more here, DaveMethvin.
[09:29:42] <DaveMethvin> ok, great then, sounds like we have a bag full of treats to keep us going
[09:29:50] <kswedberg> :)
[09:29:51] <DaveMethvin> happy halloween everyone!
[09:30:00] <DaveMethvin> see you back in -dev
[09:30:05] <kswedberg> you, too!
[09:30:15] <AddyosmanI> Indeed. happy halloween!
