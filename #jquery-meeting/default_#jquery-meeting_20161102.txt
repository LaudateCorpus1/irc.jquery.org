[12:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...now Felix.
[12:04:28] <arschmitz> hi
[12:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Did you get a chance to look at that datepicker iOS bug?
[12:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> ?!?!?!?!?!?
[12:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[12:05:39] * scott_gonzalez looks at magic 8 ball and sees "no"
[12:06:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: knows many things
[12:06:51] <arschmitz> like how little time he also had for ui this week
[12:06:55] <arschmitz> lol
[12:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> Us? Busy? No way.
[12:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately the community has been very busy too.
[12:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of bugs filed in the past two weeks.
[12:08:40] <arschmitz> yeah iv seen them come through
[12:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start at the top...
[12:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> Selectmenu is currently using the combobox role.
[12:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> We have a bug saying that's wrong.
[12:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15091
[12:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> Depending on which part of the spec you read, they're clearly right or maybe not so right.
[12:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> But I think they're right.
[12:11:06] <arschmitz> lol
[12:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> So here's what's confusing.
[12:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#combobox
[12:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> "A combo box enables the user to type in a field and at the same time chose a predefined value from a list. By using the keyboard the user can select an item from the list. After selection she will be able to type further characters in the field."
[12:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> Minus that last sentence, you could easily see how that applies to a select.
[12:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> Under keyboard navigation it says "Typing a letter (printable character) key moves focus to the next instance of a visible node whose title begins with that printable letter."
[12:13:05] <scott_gonzalez> Which to me seems to be only describing select and not combobox.
[12:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> Since a combobox should not be based on titles BEGINNING with the letter, but titles matching the full text typed so far.
[12:14:09] <arschmitz> right
[12:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> The "WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties" seems pretty clear that there must be a text field though.
[12:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> Now, if we look at https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#combobox
[12:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> The definition clearly says there is a text input.
[12:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> But if you scroll down to the Characteristics table, it says that HTML select is a related concept.
[12:15:49] <arschmitz> seems contradictory
[12:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> Now, I assume we should be using listbox: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#listbox
[12:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> Here are the docs for the authoring practices: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox
[12:17:56] <arschmitz> yeah that sounds like a select
[12:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> We currently have listbox set on the menu itself.
[12:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure how this works in terms of applying roles to the container vs. the menu, and how the button gets handled.
[12:22:43] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll come back to that.
[12:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to do some research.
[12:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> We're missing minified widget files in our distributions: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15089
[12:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> This is probably just a * vs ** glob.
[12:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> But not sure where the problem is coming from. We'll need to dig into the release script and see what's happening.
[12:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> We got another bug filed about checkboxradio styling: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15085
[12:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you want to check if that's already been addressed by your previous updates?
[12:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't looked into this one yet.
[12:28:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:28:31] <arschmitz> im seeing some issues but didnt we already release all the updates i did?
[12:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[12:29:37] <arschmitz> oh ok
[12:29:38] <arschmitz> few
[12:29:44] <arschmitz> because it all seemed broken
[12:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/1.12.1...master
[12:30:13] <arschmitz> cool then yes this is the same issue
[12:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, want to close as a duplicate then?
[12:30:33] <arschmitz> sure]
[12:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Resizable custom handles get destroyed on update: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15084
[12:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like that shouldn't be too hard to fix.
[12:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into that.
[12:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> Slider custom handles don't get positioned properly during scroll: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15083
[12:32:37] <scott_gonzalez> This isn't new, but since we added a demo for it, someone noticed :-P
[12:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> Good job making all of our flaws visible, jzaefferer :-P
[12:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> I can take a look at that one too if nobody else wants to.
[12:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, guess I'll take that on.
[12:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> And that brings us to....
[12:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> Autocomplete duplicate `remove` event listener: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15082
[12:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you think this was already addressed?
[12:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...doesn't look like it.
[12:36:20] <arschmitz> depends if that person really set the version right
[12:36:30] <arschmitz> there was an issue in 1.12.0
[12:36:35] <arschmitz> but was fixed for 1.12.1
[12:37:58] <arschmitz> looks like someone is saying its a duplicate of this
[12:37:58] <arschmitz> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10050#comment:6
[12:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> http://plnkr.co/edit/Jk2xg3ZjJ5jS5mgP1zHZ?p=preview is using 1.12.1
[12:38:56] <arschmitz> well if its related to 10050 thats a 2 year old bug
[12:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> Seems legit.
[12:39:20] <arschmitz> so not what i fixed since that was to do with classes
[12:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> Not realted.
[12:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> Just the "fix" is the same.
[12:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> Delete all event bindings.
[12:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> Of course that will stop it from growing :-P
[12:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> It will also break stuff.
[12:42:18] <arschmitz> looks like it might be
[12:42:19] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L517
[12:42:26] <arschmitz> should really be `one`
[12:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[12:44:32] <arschmitz> simple fix
[12:44:40] <arschmitz> ill do it and test it really fixes
[12:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[12:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:45:54] <arschmitz> no
[12:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> Alright. Thanks everyone (arschmitz).
