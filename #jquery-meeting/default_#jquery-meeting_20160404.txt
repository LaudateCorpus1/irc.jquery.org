[12:04:17] <markelog> hey-hey
[12:04:27] <timmywil> hello!
[12:05:08] <m_gol> present
[12:05:28] <timmywil> Thank you gibson042 for the recent PR. That would have made an rc releasable had DaveMethvin|away not pointed out a new blocker (*glares*).
[12:05:41] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3029
[12:05:41] <gibson042> I can fix the new blocker as well
[12:05:52] <timmywil> nice
[12:06:08] <gibson042> but right now am going through the Upgrade Guide in preparation for the Migrate additions
[12:06:23] <timmywil> cool
[12:06:28] <timmywil> thanks for doing all that
[12:06:53] <timmywil> I plan on releasing our one-change 1.12.3.
[12:06:55] <timmywil> today
[12:08:14] <timmywil> 3.0 rc should be this week or beginning of next.
[12:08:24] <gibson042> I think so too
[12:08:31] <timmywil> as soon as gibson042 can finish, but I also need to make some changes to blog post
[12:08:41] <timmywil>  / additions
[12:08:59] <gibson042> for the deprecations (mostly)?
[12:09:15] <timmywil> right, and an intro to the upgrade guide
[12:09:38] <timmywil> and a warning for easing
[12:10:17] <m_gol> as for 1.12.3
[12:10:33] <m_gol> we probably should fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3035
[12:10:42] <m_gol> which means we have material for 2.2.3 as well
[12:11:09] <timmywil> ah, well, good timing.
[12:12:42] <timmywil> looks like an easy fix
[12:12:48] <m_gol> yup
[12:13:15] <m_gol> gibson asked the OP about a PR, though
[12:13:18] <timmywil> alright, I think I can take care of thatt one.
[12:13:42] <timmywil> if the OP responds/does it quickly, great
[12:13:46] <gibson042> maybe just save that merge until right before the release, just in case a PR comes in
[12:13:55] <timmywil> sure
[12:13:58] <gibson042> but don't hold up the release
[12:14:04] <m_gol> +1
[12:15:18] <timmywil> gibson042's new PR needs review https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3037. Looking good to me.
[12:15:41] <timmywil> and that's about it
[12:16:21] <gibson042> it's finally happening!
[12:16:45] <timmywil> wooooooo
[12:16:51] <timmywil> alright, thanks everybody
