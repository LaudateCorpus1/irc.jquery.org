[11:02:14] <gseguin> The jQuery Mobile weekly meeting is starting
[11:02:28] <gseguin> Who's  here?
[11:02:38] <uGoMobi> hello
[11:02:47] <MauriceG> Hi gseguin - Hi all !
[11:02:59] <agcolom> Hi All!
[11:03:29] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:03:43] <gseguin> toddmparker_ & johnbender are off I believe
[11:04:11] <uGoMobi> Jason Scott as well
[11:04:48] <uGoMobi> johnbender said he was going to try to make it so maybe he joins later
[11:05:21] <gseguin> Hi MauriceG, thanks for joining
[11:05:25] <gseguin> alright so let's go ahead with your updates
[11:05:28] <gseguin> uGoMobi?
[11:05:33] <uGoMobi> yes?
[11:05:43] <uGoMobi> oh ok, sorry :)
[11:06:06] <uGoMobi> can I copy them in at once?
[11:06:35] <gseguin> yup
[11:07:00] <uGoMobi> done: bug fixing, triage and popup styling
[11:07:00] <uGoMobi> 1.1.1. final release: do we make changes to the 1.1.1RC1 code or not?
[11:07:00] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/uGoMobi/jquery-mobile/commit/db2868854d2bfd91b26db8a7c9cc20d6f60674e5 was not picked into 1.1-stable
[11:07:00] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/866bb5da445e07fc8c977e860064db3a24dc2d2d correction in one of my fixes
[11:07:00] <uGoMobi> I have 2 fixed toolbars issues assigned to me, but running out of ideas how to fix it
[11:07:01] <uGoMobi> new approach for making buttons default to mini (and inline) in toolbars
[11:07:01] <uGoMobi> currently we do this with specific rules for buttons in toolbars - this leads to many specificity issues and only works half now
[11:07:01] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (1d, 10h ago): Button widget: Rewrote code that adds class ui-submit. Fixes #4642 - submit button in header renders incorrectly [1.1.2.]
[11:07:01] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Scott Jehl (1m, 2w ago): Merge pull request #4363 from uGoMobi/issue_#3998  Fixes #3998 - All buttons, regardless of markup, should be mini by default in toolbars
[11:07:02] <uGoMobi> this should change to setting option mini so we can use the existing CSS for mini style - can we make the toolbar widget set this option (_setOptions?) and still keep it possible to override the default?
[11:07:02] <uGoMobi> this would also make it possible to have form elements default to mini in toolbars
[11:07:03] <uGoMobi> improve adding and removing active button class (navigation.js)
[11:07:03] <uGoMobi> see open issues #4611 and #1181
[11:07:04] <uGoMobi> improve visual feedback (like example 1 here http://jsbin.com/otepum/41)
[11:07:27] <uGoMobi> wow, not very clear this way, but ok
[11:07:59] <uGoMobi> wow, not very clear this way, but ok?
[11:08:16] * gseguin reads through
[11:08:30] <uGoMobi> Q: do we make changes to 1.1.1.RC1 code before final or not?
[11:09:26] <gseguin> yes we can if it's a bug and that you're very confident that it's a low risk fix
[11:09:50] <uGoMobi> ok, how does this work? can I just pick them in 1.1-stable?
[11:10:22] <gseguin> yes
[11:10:29] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:10:45] <uGoMobi> next point: 2 fixed toolbar issues
[11:10:48] <gseguin> it would be great if you can have another team member review the fix before you do so
[11:11:01] <uGoMobi> ok good idea
[11:11:32] <uGoMobi> it only concerns those two
[11:11:48] <uGoMobi> those = the ones I copied in agenda
[11:12:24] <gseguin> we can take that to -dev, maybe?
[11:12:24] <uGoMobi> so the 2 fixed toolbar issues are 2 out of many but those are assigned to me, need help with that
[11:12:47] <uGoMobi> sorry, what do you mean by -dev?
[11:12:56] <gseguin> the dev channel
[11:13:04] <uGoMobi> ah ok :)
[11:13:35] <uGoMobi> who is the right one to ask for help? is Scott available?
[11:14:04] <gseguin> I would think he's the one to ask
[11:14:15] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:14:40] <gseguin> if he's not on IRC, send an email on BC
[11:14:52] <uGoMobi> last two points... just something I want others two look at and let me know what you think
[11:15:00] <uGoMobi> we can take that to -dev as well
[11:15:24] <uGoMobi> for the record: 1. new approach for making buttons default to mini (and inline) in toolbars
[11:15:33] <uGoMobi> 2. mprove adding and removing active button class (navigation.js)
[11:15:39] <uGoMobi> improve*
[11:15:56] <gseguin> are there PRs in for these?
[11:16:04] <uGoMobi> no
[11:16:22] <gseguin> have you started working on it?
[11:16:29] <uGoMobi> first like to know if we want to change it
[11:16:34] <uGoMobi> no
[11:17:16] <gseguin> ok, maybe when the rest of the team is back, next week we can talk about on #jquerymobile-dev
[11:17:34] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:17:41] <uGoMobi> ok thats it for me
[11:17:59] <gseguin> thank you uGoMobi
[11:18:07] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: what's up?
[11:18:17] <_|Nix|_> Three things, mostly.
[11:18:42] <_|Nix|_> 1. Minor fix for IE8 - been using things like window.innerWidth which is unavailable in IE8 ...
[11:18:53] <_|Nix|_> Switched to using jQuery methods which work everywhere.
[11:19:27] <_|Nix|_> 2. Slightly bigger thing: Noticed that page titles are not always reflected in the window title consistently (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2865#issuecomment-6727496)
[11:19:28] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2865 on jquery-mobile (toddparker; 8m, 1w ago): Page title overridden on first load
[11:19:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_ said he'd look at that - when he gets back, I guess ...
[11:19:58] <_|Nix|_> and 3. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4595
[11:19:59] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4595 on jquery-mobile (DzenisevichK; 1w, 5d ago): Popup causes navigation back from a redirected page
[11:20:30] <_|Nix|_> Turns out that if you add pages to the urlHistory with changeHash: false, and then open a dialog, it goes back to the last page that was added with changeHash: true ...
[11:20:43] <_|Nix|_> ... when you close the dialog.
[11:21:19] <_|Nix|_> So, I need to find a good place to add a special case to go back to the previous page in the urlHistory, not the page identified by examining the hash given to _handleHashChange ...
[11:21:28] <gseguin> which makes sense since you do a history.back
[11:22:10] <_|Nix|_> You do window.history.back(), but since you didn't use the hash to get here, you will end up back where you last used the hash ...
[11:22:58] <_|Nix|_> I'm tempted to say that, if you don't use the hash, don't expect jqm to navigate you correctly, so it's up to you to get back to the right page ...
[11:23:13] <gseguin> If you implement such thing won't it break the hardware back button?
[11:23:33] <gseguin> I think that's fair
[11:24:30] <gseguin> it might introduce too much complexity to handle such a use case
[11:24:32] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, we do provide changePage( url, { changeHash: false } ) ...
[11:24:47] <_|Nix|_> It certainly looks like it.
[11:25:40] <_|Nix|_> I mean, if you crowd multiple urlHistory entries into a single browser history entry, you can't expect to be able to access all urlHistory entries ...
[11:25:58] <_|Nix|_> ... unless you write some navigation code yourself.
[11:25:58] <gseguin> exactly
[11:26:29] <gseguin> so maybe provide ways to override the behavior of the popup close
[11:26:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, do I mark https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4595 as WONTFIX?
[11:26:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4595 on jquery-mobile (DzenisevichK; 1w, 5d ago): Popup causes navigation back from a redirected page
[11:26:49] <gseguin> but I don't think we should handle it
[11:27:27] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: let's wait for toddmparker_ on this one but I'm +1 for WONTFIX
[11:27:48] <_|Nix|_> OK ... nav is complex enough as it is ...
[11:27:54] <uGoMobi> lets add a note to the docs
[11:28:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, a caveat about using changeHash: false ...
[11:28:18] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:29:00] <_|Nix|_> Then, there was actually one more thing. I was talking to Elliot Smith about interrupting the page change process when things need to be done asynchronously before the next page can be shown.
[11:29:29] <_|Nix|_> He things it would greatly improve how jqm interacts with other frameworks such as Knockout.
[11:30:04] <_|Nix|_> I was thinking that, maybe pagebeforechange should pass around an object that collects deferreds, and then wait for all of those to be resolved before it proceeds with the page chagne.
[11:30:12] <gseguin> interrupting as in stopping and resuming?
[11:30:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ... wait for a bunch of deferreds to be done, and move the rest of changePage inside the .done
[11:31:15] <gseguin> That sounds like a good idea
[11:31:41] <gseguin> branch?
[11:31:50] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: pagebeforechange already passes around an object because you can redirect by overwriting toPage. So, the object might also contain an array of deferred.
[11:31:58] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: *nod*
[11:32:27] <gseguin> awesome.
[11:32:35] <gseguin> next
[11:32:44] <_|Nix|_> Then I tried to reproduce some popup sizing issues with my shiny new iOS 5.1.1 iPod touch, but no dice.
[11:32:57] <uGoMobi> :(
[11:32:57] <_|Nix|_> That's about it.
[11:33:18] <agcolom> I can test stuff on iOS 5.1, 4.3.3 if you need (and 3.something)
[11:33:43] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK, I'll put the pictures up to where you can see them. Try to reproduce the screenshot.
[11:33:48] <_|Nix|_> I'm done.
[11:33:51] <agcolom> ok
[11:34:08] <gseguin> agcolom: your turn
[11:34:36] <agcolom> ok, Hi, the 1st week was really around getting ready for the SF conf and 1.1.1-rc.1
[11:34:41] <agcolom> Prepared docs for 1.1.1-rc.1
[11:34:41] <agcolom>     prepared docs popup demos with uGoMobi (map & video) for SF conf
[11:34:41] <agcolom>     1 or 2? widget for the API docs. (we now have 8)
[11:34:41] <agcolom>     added 1 iframe to illustrate the possibility of using iframes for api docs demos
[11:34:41] <agcolom>     created & sent screenshots for Todd’s talk at SF conference
[11:34:41] <agcolom>     Many doc PRs (corrections/clarifications)
[11:34:42] <agcolom>     some doc commits (corrections/clarifications that are discovered when porting widget docs to api docs + added popup and loading widget to the seach)
[11:34:42] <agcolom>     10 PRs/Commits need to be cherry-picked
[11:34:42] <agcolom>     Added commit message to the readme (as advised by JZefferer)
[11:34:43] <agcolom>     Added a checklist on GitHub for new releases (to avoid missing doc updates in the future)
[11:34:43] <agcolom>     Some triage (including Android 2.2 issues testing thx to a device lent by a colleague)
[11:34:44] <agcolom>     Some issues I’d like the team to look at:
[11:35:47] <agcolom> so the good news is I have an Android 2.2 at home that was lent to me (until further notice :-) ) and it's really useful for bug triage
[11:36:51] <agcolom> I discover errors in the docs as I port the widget info to the new api docs, so that;s a really useful exercise... but slow...
[11:37:25] <agcolom> the 10 PRs/Commits that need to be cherry-picked are written down... I understand that we can cherry-pick into 1.1-stable?
[11:37:53] <gseguin> if it's doc and it applies to 1.1.1 then no problem
[11:37:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, seems pretty safe :)
[11:38:25] <gseguin> anything else agcolom ?
[11:38:32] <agcolom> ok, will do this evening..
[11:38:42] <agcolom> no that's it really.
[11:39:15] <uGoMobi> Some issues I’d like the team to look at ?
[11:39:26] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2810
[11:39:26] <gseguin> shoot
[11:39:27] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2810 on jquery-mobile (anpsince83; 8m, 2w ago): Page height not updated correctly after orientation change on iPad with RC2
[11:39:29] <uGoMobi> you ask on -dev?
[11:39:46] <agcolom> only saw it yesterday when I was looking at old issues
[11:40:51] <uGoMobi> the way we calculate min-height has changed
[11:41:07] <uGoMobi> the issue is 9 months old so might not be an issue anymore
[11:41:21] <agcolom> but was reported as still an issue 1 month ago
[11:41:39] <uGoMobi> ah ok, see the last comment now
[11:41:52] <gseguin> is it still the case in 1.1.1 ?
[11:42:18] <agcolom> I don't know. I guess I can try... or ask them to report
[11:42:27] <gseguin> ok, let's take that to -dev and bring it back into todd's radar
[11:42:37] <agcolom> ok
[11:42:43] <agcolom> That's it from me
[11:42:51] <gseguin> thank you agcolom
[11:42:52] <gseguin> MauriceG: welcome to our weekly meeting and thank you for your help, do you have an update
[11:42:55] <gseguin> ?
[11:43:38] <gseguin> I guess not ;)
[11:43:47] <gseguin> I'll go then
[11:43:56] <MauriceG> Thanks, no.
[11:44:03] <gseguin> last week was jQCon SF
[11:44:29] <gseguin> Todd's presentation was very well received
[11:44:49] <gseguin> great job everyone!
[11:45:25] <gseguin> We announced 1.1.1-RC1 and the download builder
[11:45:32] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:46:06] <gseguin> so far I haven't seen stopper issues for 1.1.1 which is awesome
[11:46:07] <MauriceG> somebody may found a video about the presentation ?
[11:46:44] <gseguin> and there were only  a couple issues filed against the builder
[11:46:51] <gseguin> which are now fixed
[11:47:12] <uGoMobi> would be interesting to know how many times the zip is downloaded and the amount of traffic to the source files on the CDN
[11:47:59] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I need to do some log grepping on the backend of the builder to figure it out
[11:48:25] <gseguin> for the CDN johnbender would be the one to ask
[11:48:28] <uGoMobi> sorry, meant 1.1.1.RC1 but same goes for builder yes
[11:48:34] <gseguin> that's pretty much it for me
[11:48:38] <agcolom> FYI I've also added some articles to the resources page this week. That includes Todd's presentation slides from the SF Conf.
[11:48:49] <agcolom> if anyone wants to see
[11:49:16] <MauriceG> agcolom: okay, thanks
[11:49:30] <gseguin> anyone from the community wants to bring up anything?
[11:50:02] <gseguin> We'll wait one more minute
[11:50:15] <agcolom> I think the video will be released later. The UK one took a few months. I'll add it as well when it's released
[11:50:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: in the meantime... when do you think we release 1.1.1 final?
[11:51:00] <gseguin> I don't know when toddmparker_ will be back
[11:51:11] <uGoMobi> ok, was just curious
[11:51:15] <gseguin> I think end of next week most likely
[11:51:22] <uGoMobi> ok, thanks
[11:51:48] <gseguin> alright, thank you folks, see you on #jquerymobile-dev
[11:52:08] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:52:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Have a safe trip!
[11:52:40] <gseguin> thank you!
