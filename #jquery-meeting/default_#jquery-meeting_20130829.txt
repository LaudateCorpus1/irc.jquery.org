[11:00:36] * _|Nix|_ waves
[11:00:38] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:00:57] <_|Nix|_> What's another word for a barbecue?
[11:01:02] <uGoMobi> BBQ
[11:01:07] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:01:11] <_|Nix|_> No, that's an abbreviation.
[11:01:15] <_|Nix|_> It's a meating.
[11:01:28] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:01:30] <_|Nix|_> Please don't kill me!
[11:01:40] <uGoMobi> let's meat
[11:01:50] <gseguin> and talk bacon ?
[11:01:50] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:01:54] <uGoMobi> agenda / updates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SfIJyX_SYZ5GFXbmeLVOje5w7y-2GTJEHt0MNuVRET4/edit?usp=sharing
[11:02:03] <gseguin> hiya everyone!
[11:02:08] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:02:11] <gseguin> 2 weeks!
[11:02:18] <_|Nix|_> Bienvenu!
[11:02:47] <_|Nix|_> Or, tervetuloa as they say locally.
[11:02:50] <uGoMobi> last week we didn't have a meeting
[11:03:06] <_|Nix|_> Oh, great! I happened to be on vacation. Great!
[11:03:15] <gseguin> well we technically had one but it was the shortest meeting ever
[11:03:23] <uGoMobi> only arschmitz, gseguin and I were here so we decided to discuss things on -dev
[11:03:47] <arschmitz> hi
[11:03:48] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK. Gotcha.
[11:03:53] <uGoMobi> hi arschmitz
[11:04:14] <uGoMobi> the first item on the agenda: John Bender, Scott Jehl, Mat Marquis, Jeff Lembeck, and Jason Scott are no longer officially on the team
[11:04:33] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...
[11:04:45] <uGoMobi> they don't have time anymore to contribute to the projects on regular base
[11:05:41] <uGoMobi> but all of them still want to help
[11:05:54] <uGoMobi> anyways...
[11:06:08] <uGoMobi> BIG THANK YOU !!
[11:06:20] * _|Nix|_ applauds
[11:06:26] <uGoMobi> for all the great work on the project
[11:06:39] <_|Nix|_> Yeah! +1.0e6
[11:07:00] <gseguin> Thank you! a bazillion times!
[11:07:14] <arschmitz> yeah the help will be missed for sure
[11:07:26] <_|Nix|_> Definitely. We need to do a recruiting drive.
[11:07:56] <uGoMobi> talking about great work... next agenda item: 1.4
[11:08:39] <gseguin> _|Nix|_ is right, let's try to recruit at the upcoming conference
[11:08:57] <arschmitz> agcolom's talk is all about that
[11:09:04] <arschmitz> in austin
[11:09:05] <gseguin> kewl
[11:09:24] <uGoMobi> yeah, would be great if we can find some new people
[11:09:40] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[11:09:45] <uGoMobi> so after agcolom her talk in Austin we lock the doors :D
[11:09:53] <gseguin> :)
[11:10:08] <_|Nix|_> You ain't gettin' out 'till you've contributed at least 150 lines.
[11:10:21] <uGoMobi> right
[11:10:40] <_|Nix|_> Now git!
[11:10:48] <_|Nix|_> clone, that is :)
[11:11:11] <_|Nix|_> NM me ...
[11:11:59] <uGoMobi> I like to discuss what we need to do before we can release 1.4 beta 1
[11:12:18] <uGoMobi> let's start with open issues
[11:12:24] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=20&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[11:12:56] <uGoMobi> what issues need to be fixed before we can release beta?
[11:13:46] <arschmitz> i would like to take care of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6347
[11:13:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Some seem easy enough - like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3415
[11:13:50] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6347 by doomsy (1w 6d ago): Scrolling vertically on panel fails after first scroll on ios device (1.4.0a2)
[11:13:55] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #3415 by scottjehl (19mon 2w ago): pagecontainercreate should trigger on the page container, not window
[11:14:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i got that already
[11:14:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean you've fixed it?
[11:14:37] <uGoMobi> I want to fix this one before beta https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6348
[11:14:37] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6348 by uGoMobi (1w 6d ago): Theme inheritance during transition
[11:15:15] <uGoMobi> and this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6349
[11:15:15] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6349 by uGoMobi (1w 6d ago): Panel: Page contents disappear when opening a panel on WP8
[11:15:23] <_|Nix|_> OK, then I'll suspend my API doc activities and look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6365
[11:15:24] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6365 by robcaldecott (1w 1d ago): Popups containing textareas change height when characters typed
[11:15:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah uGoMobi and i started looking at that one
[11:16:19] <_|Nix|_> I think we can close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4974, right?
[11:16:19] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #4974 by johnbender (11mon 2w ago): Move non-option constants to defaults object
[11:16:22] <arschmitz> but found another issue we were trying to fix and i dunno then got distracted by other stuff
[11:16:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[11:16:36] <_|Nix|_> Bam!
[11:17:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what happened to the same page transition one i can find it now did you close that?
[11:17:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, I didn't close but I don't think it has 1.4 milestone
[11:17:43] <arschmitz> ohhhh ok
[11:18:00] <uGoMobi> we can leave that one for now
[11:18:06] <arschmitz> ok
[11:18:09] <_|Nix|_> I'll close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6163 ...
[11:18:09] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6163 by gabrielschulhof (1mon 2w ago): When enhancing an already-enhanced widget, _setOptions() must still be called, but it must do nothing
[11:18:23] <_|Nix|_> We're not calling _setOptions from _create anymore.
[11:18:27] <arschmitz> yup
[11:19:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you test https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6349 on Nokia Lumia 920?
[11:19:40] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6349 by uGoMobi (1w 6d ago): Panel: Page contents disappear when opening a panel on WP8
[11:19:54] <arschmitz> i can
[11:19:57] <uGoMobi> I tested on Lumia 520
[11:20:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this is the same page transition issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4078#issuecomment-23430866
[11:20:32] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #4078 by storm (16mon 1w ago): Page receives display:none after samePageTransition
[11:20:43] <uGoMobi> assigned it to you
[11:20:46] <arschmitz> ok thanks
[11:21:13] <uGoMobi> how about this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6394
[11:21:13] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6394 by negue (3d 7h ago): Dynamically setting the Toolbar to a "fixed" Mode doesn't work anymore with 1.4
[11:21:32] <arschmitz> oh i just need to push the fix for that
[11:21:35] <_|Nix|_> Sounds like a widget review item.
[11:21:37] <arschmitz> its very simple
[11:21:38] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:22:11] <uGoMobi> I fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6407 but didn't push yet
[11:22:12] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6407 by uGoMobi (1d 7h ago): Nodisc and alt icon classes don't work when added to button or anchor elements
[11:22:19] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:22:36] <uGoMobi> the nested listview demo can be added later
[11:22:54] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, we can work on demos/docs until the last second.
[11:23:22] <arschmitz> yeah nested lists is more or less done just needs to go into actuall demos _|Nix|_ and i worked out all the "mechanics"
[11:23:41] <uGoMobi> yeah, I noticed the discussions :)
[11:23:44] <uGoMobi> nice!
[11:24:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. I learned that you can't arbitrarily turn nesting on and off and on and off as you go deeper and deeper into sublists :(
[11:24:27] <uGoMobi> yeah, we can still work on updating demos and API docs until final
[11:24:58] <uGoMobi> but what I am a bit worried about that people don't test if we don't provide them some documentation
[11:25:10] <arschmitz> right i agree
[11:25:22] <arschmitz> need something more for people to go on
[11:25:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I meant indentation, not nesting. Sorry.
[11:25:30] <uGoMobi> I am going through the demos and work on upgrade guide at the same time
[11:25:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i knew i saw convo earlier
[11:26:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry, I just wanna shout it from the mountaintop, because it's a fairly fundamental limitation of CSS.
[11:26:59] <uGoMobi> I also created a "classic" theme which should help people with upgrading
[11:27:02] <_|Nix|_> Well, people might test their existing stuff, so we're more likely to learn about regressions than whether the new stuff is working correctly.
[11:27:43] <uGoMobi> not sure, most alpha issues were about new filterable
[11:27:57] <uGoMobi> many people look out to new features
[11:28:04] <uGoMobi> and it's the first thing they try
[11:28:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but only because it replaces the old listview filter.
[11:28:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess that's even better.
[11:28:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not so sure i agree people set up little test apps just to see how new things work or play in jsbin
[11:28:47] <uGoMobi> yeah, we need both to be tested
[11:28:47] <arschmitz> before bothering to try actually porting apps
[11:29:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[11:29:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but if they just drop in the new version and find things are breaking they will surely report that.
[11:29:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess that counts as porting, but only in the most trivial way.
[11:30:06] <uGoMobi> BTW - because I am also reorganizing the demos I am working in a branch demos-update
[11:30:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Saw that. Good!
[11:30:33] <_|Nix|_> Looking forward to the new setup.
[11:31:11] <uGoMobi> I shared this doc with you all https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWN1UAncQHcmDfy9UuD_ftMtyhQhWiq3inYm0ReE-J8/edit?usp=sharing
[11:31:33] <uGoMobi> about all our information and documentation
[11:31:54] <uGoMobi> it's a bit messy because it's an overview and todo in one, sorry
[11:32:01] <gseguin> I would like to do the versionning of the demos, part of the build so we don't ever have to do it manually again
[11:32:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: +1
[11:32:32] <gseguin> I'll try to look into that tonight
[11:32:33] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:33:14] <uGoMobi> the main reason to reorganize the demos is to make them easier to maintain
[11:33:57] <uGoMobi> we more or less made it a web site on it's own but don't have the time to maintain that next to API docs and web site
[11:33:57] <gseguin> Just saw that on twitter: https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247
[11:34:06] <_|Nix|_> I wonder if we could do something like <div class="jqm-version" data-src="jqm-version.json"></div><script>$.ajax( $( ".jqm-version" ).attr( "data-src" ) ).done( function( data ) { $( ".jqm-version" ).text( data.version ); } ); </script>
[11:34:06] <uGoMobi> and still do some development ;)
[11:35:00] <uGoMobi> gseguin: cool
[11:35:22] <uGoMobi> I also want the API docs and demos to be more organized the same way
[11:35:38] <uGoMobi> so you can use them next to eachother
[11:36:17] <uGoMobi> and people get a good picture of what jQuery Mobile offers
[11:36:28] <uGoMobi> back to 1.4 beta planning
[11:36:48] <uGoMobi> we need a couple more days to fix issues
[11:37:18] <uGoMobi> and I need at least 2 more days for documentation and upgrade guide
[11:37:40] <arschmitz> so like monday or tuesday?
[11:38:04] <uGoMobi> Tuesday would be nice
[11:38:26] <_|Nix|_> Sounds good.
[11:38:36] <arschmitz> too bad final wont be ready to release in Austin lol
[11:38:41] <_|Nix|_> BTW: What exactly does beta mean in terms of making code changes to the lib?
[11:38:45] <uGoMobi> if no big issues pop up we can release RC1 around Austin conf
[11:39:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah too bad
[11:39:37] <uGoMobi> but we also have lots of work to do on the web site
[11:39:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh for sure
[11:40:10] <uGoMobi> so we can switch to new WordPress theme when we launch 1.4 final
[11:40:41] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yeah releasing at the conference would be a good idea
[11:40:55] <arschmitz> that will be awesome to no longer be the black sheep in the jquery family lol
[11:41:03] <gseguin> like press the button, on stage
[11:41:10] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:41:19] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you mean new web site or 1.4 final release
[11:41:20] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:41:21] <arschmitz> be on the same setup as all the other projects
[11:41:29] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:41:31] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure.
[11:41:32] <gseguin> 1.4 RC1 or final
[11:41:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think Austin'd be too soon for final.
[11:41:53] <uGoMobi> RC1 should be possible
[11:42:29] <arschmitz> who would do it though
[11:42:35] <arschmitz> scott is doing the mobile keynote lol
[11:42:43] <_|Nix|_> So, like, is beta purely bugfixing, or can we do some performance improvements?
[11:42:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: bugs i think
[11:42:57] <uGoMobi> we can hack in arschmitz
[11:42:58] <gseguin> one of us while he's talking
[11:43:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so no more perf tweaks? *sigh* ...
[11:43:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I guess those can go into 1.4.1.
[11:43:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: depends on what the change looks like
[11:43:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not that I have any in mind, just to do a(nother) general pass.
[11:44:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if its like a selector or something simple sure
[11:44:18] <arschmitz> but not if its like real changes
[11:44:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we have to leave that for 1.5
[11:44:30] <uGoMobi> and focus on getting documentation ready
[11:44:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking more about making sure we set attributes before we attach to the DOM and stuff like that.
[11:44:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Use document fragments instead of multiple attaches.
[11:44:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that stuff should wait
[11:45:00] <uGoMobi> we can keep making improvements forever, but we have to release too :D
[11:45:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, so that's 1.4.1 stuff.
[11:45:25] <uGoMobi> so let's only fix the regressions we discussed earlier
[11:45:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:45:35] <gseguin> MUST. RELEASE. OFTEN.
[11:45:44] <uGoMobi> exactly
[11:46:12] <uGoMobi> after 1.4 final release we will have a meeting to discuss some things about the way we work
[11:46:39] <uGoMobi> like updating docs and demos while we make a change, etc
[11:46:49] <uGoMobi> commit messages is another
[11:46:50] <_|Nix|_> I think we've taken on quite a bit with 1.4.0. I think more than one team would've called it 2.0.
[11:47:20] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:47:47] <_|Nix|_> I wonder if we could do a git hook to generate commit messages.
[11:48:10] <_|Nix|_> Like in ncurses, with text fields and stuff.
[11:48:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz worked on automating that
[11:48:55] <gseguin> gotta drop off guys, see you on -dev
[11:49:01] <uGoMobi> later gseguin
[11:49:03] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: K L8R
[11:49:22] <uGoMobi> any new PR's we need to discuss?
[11:49:39] <_|Nix|_> What about that fixes-flickering-transitions one?
[11:49:43] <_|Nix|_> Just curious.
[11:49:48] <_|Nix|_> That seems fairly involved.
[11:50:04] <_|Nix|_> In terms of making sure we don't break anything.
[11:50:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean?
[11:51:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, if we chose to make a change in response to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/54121
[11:51:33] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[11:51:35] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5431
[11:51:36] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5431 by hikalkan (7mon 2w ago): Solution to flicker problem in jQuery mobile page transitions!
[11:51:43] <_|Nix|_> We'd have to test on a boatload of devices.
[11:51:56] <_|Nix|_> There are mixed reports in that bug as to whether it works or not.
[11:52:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, it's a complicated one
[11:52:36] <uGoMobi> a lot of rant in there :(
[11:52:53] <uGoMobi> but nobody answered my question
[11:53:14] <uGoMobi> oops... wrong ticket
[11:53:30] <uGoMobi> I was talking about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4024
[11:53:31] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #4024 by elfgoh (16mon 2w ago): White flash/flicker when transiting between 2 web pages in Phonegap
[11:53:59] <uGoMobi> I was asking there if https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5431 resolves the problem
[11:53:59] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5431 by hikalkan (7mon 2w ago): Solution to flicker problem in jQuery mobile page transitions!
[11:55:15] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Pretty back-and-forth.
[11:55:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5431 setting disablePageZoom to false gives the same result
[11:55:19] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5431 by hikalkan (7mon 2w ago): Solution to flicker problem in jQuery mobile page transitions!
[11:55:38] <uGoMobi> so I don't think we should make a change in the library right now
[11:56:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:57:21] <uGoMobi> there is one new PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6389
[11:57:22] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #6389 by pereorga (4d 20h ago): Theme: Optimize images using lossless compression
[11:57:37] <_|Nix|_> That sounds like an easy win.
[11:57:57] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:58:10] <uGoMobi> not sure what scott_gonzalez meant with his comment
[11:58:16] <uGoMobi> will ask on -dev
[11:58:49] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss here?
[11:59:21] <uGoMobi> any questions from the community?
[11:59:45] <uGoMobi> looks like we can wrap up
[11:59:49] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:59:52] * _|Nix|_ waves
[11:59:58] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
