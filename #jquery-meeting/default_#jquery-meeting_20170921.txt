[14:09:42] <arschmitz> Mobile meeting
[14:10:33] <apsdehal____> Hey
[14:13:07] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Hey
[14:13:45] <arschmitz> hey
[14:14:17] <arschmitz> so i dont have a whole lot to report since last time didnt get a chance to finish blog been crazy worked like 100 hours in last week
[14:14:30] <apsdehal> woah
[14:14:43] <apsdehal> seems like it was a very busy week
[14:15:09] <apsdehal> any progress in PR?
[14:17:12] <arschmitz> talking about this one? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/397
[14:17:36] <apsdehal> Yes
[14:17:47] <arschmitz> looking through right now
[14:17:55] <arschmitz> was this all just search and replace?
[14:18:18] <apsdehal> Yes :)
[14:18:42] <apsdehal> Though I went through all the pages and checked if everything was working fine
[14:19:04] <arschmitz> ok i approved it i went through a bunch and looked fine im not going to look at the same 2 char change 600 time lol
[14:19:35] <apsdehal> Also, I went to open source community group in school. Apparently Mozilla is sponsoring 20 around colleges in US to open up such groups everywhere which do open source work.
[14:20:21] <apsdehal> We should get around 3 mentees working on jQuery UI and Mobile. Contribution period can be of 6 months or 1 year.
[14:21:16] <apsdehal> We need to be prepared with starter bugs and features in case they come around to contribute.
[14:22:00] <apsdehal> And an outline of what they will work on. The group expects us to spend around 2 hours a week mentoring and showing progress of the mentees around every 2 weeks.
[14:22:32] <arschmitz> thats great!
[14:23:09] <arschmitz> 2 hours a week i can handle lol
[14:23:31] <apsdehal> Yes, only issue is that I can't meet them mostly in person as they want because my classes clash with the time they meet. So I asked them that we will contact through text communication mostly.
[14:24:05] <apsdehal> Yes, I can help in mentoring anytime just that meeting clashes. But I can meet them on some other time except the usual group meeting time.
[14:24:21] <apsdehal> Also,  we need to figure out what to do with IRC.
[14:24:51] <apsdehal> Because probably we would want to have faster means of communication where everyone is easily available.
[14:25:35] <apsdehal> I am really excited about having new contributors on board. We should keep on looking for the same from other schools as Mozilla will apparently have such groups in other places also.
[14:25:45] <apsdehal> And let's see how people respond to your blog post.
[14:26:27] <arschmitz> yup
[14:26:41] <arschmitz> im open to other forms of chat outside irc like i said last time
[14:26:53] <arschmitz> whatever will be most effective for getting and keeping contributors
[14:27:39] <apsdehal> Yes, let's figure out that by next week.
[14:28:10] <apsdehal> That was what I had for this week. I will merge these PRs once that is done, we can push forward the 1.5-beta launch
[14:28:22] <apsdehal> So that we have more testers on board
[14:31:22] <arschmitz> sounds good
