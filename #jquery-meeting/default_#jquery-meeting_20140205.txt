[09:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz gnarf jzaefferer kborchers rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:00:07] <rxaviers> Hey
[09:00:09] <arschmitz> hi
[09:00:16] <kborchers> hey
[09:00:17] <jzaefferer> ola
[09:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> Not too much to talk about today.
[09:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz is working on checkbox/radio.
[09:02:22] <jzaefferer> that's not yet in any PR, right?
[09:02:28] <arschmitz> yeah trying to make sure its ready to go over next week
[09:02:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the new branch is not i should probably close the old one and open a new one on new branch
[09:02:53] <jzaefferer> guess its there: ui/jquery.ui.checkboxradio.js
[09:03:14] <tj_vantoll> hi
[09:03:42] <jzaefferer> I don't understand. I see radio/checkbox code on the button branch; is there something else?
[09:04:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thats the branch that uses before and after
[09:04:12] <jzaefferer> oh
[09:04:15] <jzaefferer> I see
[09:04:18] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott had asked me to do a new branch with spans
[09:04:40] <jzaefferer> can you close that PR and create a new one from the span-button-PR?
[09:04:54] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yea i just mentioned i should probably do that
[09:05:02] <jzaefferer> okay :-)
[09:05:08] <jzaefferer> I agree
[09:05:14] <arschmitz> cool well do :)
[09:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, might as well now that we know we're definitely going with the span implementation.
[09:05:40] <arschmitz> yeah i delete the old branch too unless someone has a reason to keep?
[09:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[09:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> We have the PR for reference if we need it anyway.
[09:06:23] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:06:30] <jzaefferer> Does the PR survive deletion of the branch?
[09:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:06:40] <arschmitz> yea its an issue
[09:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> PRs are permanent.
[09:06:44] <arschmitz> and issues cant be deleted
[09:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so arschmitz will close the PR, delete the branch, and we'll review the full progress in San Diego.
[09:08:27] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to give an update on the date module for Globalize?
[09:09:00] <rxaviers> well, I don't have too much to talk about today either... I've been working on the globalize presentation...
[09:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we can just skip it this week if there's not much to report.
[09:09:51] <rxaviers> I think we could. Not too much progress
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll has a PR for Bower support.
[09:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1189
[09:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> It moves the canonical data source for jQuery core compat from being buried inside a grunt task to being in bower.json.
[09:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> So that's a nice change.
[09:11:39] <tj_vantoll> Can anybody think of any thing else we need for this? I'd like to handle external support before tackling using Bower within our own repo.
[09:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> Does Bower support doing installs from a local or a specified remote like npm does?
[09:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> Like `bower install /path/to/repo`
[09:13:26] <rxaviers> it does
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so there's a sane way to test this.
[09:14:16] <rxaviers> What's the goal of supporting bower.json? Usually, bower.json is used for two things: use it ourselves on development to install dependencies, and guide users to use bower to install jquery-ui themselves as a dependency.
[09:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> Let's do a group test in San Diego to make sure we're good with how this works.
[09:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to use it for both.
[09:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> This PR is for users to install jQuery UI.
[09:15:52] <tj_vantoll> That sounds good.
[09:16:18] <rxaviers> when we tag versions, we don't change VERSION on ui/*js files
[09:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> We will.
[09:16:59] <tj_vantoll> jquery-release?
[09:17:16] <rxaviers> great. That's a requisite to make it usable I think
[09:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, see http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9465
[09:18:33] <rxaviers> ah! cool
[09:18:53] <rxaviers> About "When this is ready, we'll need to claim ownership of the jquery-ui component in the Bower registry"
[09:19:08] <rxaviers> Current jquery-ui component in Bower has themes
[09:19:13] <rxaviers> We wont include themes right
[09:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> We'll probably include the base theme.
[09:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> But nothing generated.
[09:19:49] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I didn't exclude the base theme in my PR.
[09:19:51] <rxaviers> Yeah, they have a list of themes we distribute in the CDN
[09:20:09] <rxaviers> the "preset" themes
[09:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> Seems pretty heavy.
[09:20:21] <rxaviers> I dont know how to call it. But, I guess we wont be distributing them
[09:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Someone can publish a jquery-ui-themes if they wnat.
[09:21:14] <rxaviers> When we switch bower registry to point to ours. We'll cause an impact on users.
[09:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> That's ok.
[09:21:57] <rxaviers> Im not saying we should mimic them. But, people will get diff files.
[09:21:58] <rxaviers> ok
[09:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone who gets our version without explicitly updating their dependency version deserves to have it break on them :-P
[09:22:35] <scott_gonzalez> It'd mean they're using 1.x or *
[09:22:58] <jzaefferer> Well, it might still complicate getting the registry updated: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120#issuecomment-34130170
[09:23:10] <jzaefferer> "If I change as you requested any user pinned to a lesser version will be left with a completely broken application. "
[09:23:39] <jzaefferer> maybe timmywil already figured something out?
[09:24:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, maybe.
[09:24:04] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't be opposed to re-publishing all the existing verions.
[09:24:33] <jzaefferer> what would that look like?
[09:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we can just take the current source and publish it?
[09:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> Or is Bower really tied to a git repo and doesn't have a separate publish process?
[09:25:33] * scott_gonzalez should probably learn how Bower works...
[09:25:57] <tj_vantoll> I was under the assumption it was tied at the hip to the git repo, but I guess I don't know for sure either.
[09:26:28] <rxaviers> hehe.. as far as I know, it was completely tied to a git repo. I heard they were interested on managing the publish process themselves, like npm.
[09:26:32] <rxaviers> But, I didnt follow this
[09:26:54] <scott_gonzalez> Let's hound Dan about it in San Diego :-)
[09:26:57] <rxaviers> dan may know
[09:26:58] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:27:13] <tj_vantoll> Perfect :)
[09:27:59] <jzaefferer> I guess that's why a lot of people still prefer npm, since it has all this figured out...
[09:28:15] <rxaviers> I think they serve diff purposes :p
[09:28:33] <rxaviers> personally, I use bower for client-side, npm for server-side
[09:29:08] <jzaefferer> sure, that's why we figured to adopt both, but that doesn't change all the shortcomings bower has compared to npm
[09:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, let's talk about San Diego for a bit.
[09:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpFPKgaoPYKO2ijsFmJ8sXdu2Fdty3Jvroth6nLCTMc/edit
[09:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone has anything else to discuss in San Deigo, please add it to the list.
[09:30:01] <rxaviers> ok
[09:32:38] <fnagel> Any plans to add a gitattrributes file to the repo, so windows user do not need to change files for running unit tests?
[09:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Yeah, I thought you were discussing that with DaveMethvin.
[09:33:11] <jzaefferer> Can we just zip up our repo and upload that as a alpha/beta release for 1.11? Or we do need all the infrastructure changes before we can publish anything?
[09:33:36] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: yeah, but without anybody in charge said "lets do it"
[09:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What do you mean?
[09:33:45] <jzaefferer> we already have "*       text=auto" in .gitattributes, is that not good enough?
[09:33:48] <fnagel> See here: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jqueryui-dev/default_%23jqueryui-dev_20140115.log.html#t07:56:38
[09:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Oh, I thought I had said yes.
[09:34:36] <fnagel> jzaefferer: no, we need something like this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.gitattributes
[09:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jqueryui-dev/default_%23jqueryui-dev_20140115.log.html#t07:38:25
[09:35:17] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[09:35:28] <jzaefferer> that sucks, since it'll change images as well
[09:35:40] <jzaefferer> I actually dealt with this elsewhere, ending up with this: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/.gitattributes
[09:35:49] <fnagel> adding it for txt only should work too
[09:36:09] <fnagel> jzaefferer: looks good to me, shoudl work on windows
[09:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the extension-specific setting seems safer.
[09:36:42] <scott_gonzalez> Let's just put this on the team discussion for San Diego and we can get core to use the same settings.
[09:36:49] <jzaefferer> afaik `* text=lf` is what we want, but git doesn't support that
[09:38:42] <fnagel> One more thing: any news on the usage of outerWidth IE7 issue Dave wanted to look at? Just asking as the selectmenu tests still fail because of that
[09:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14723
[09:40:24] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: I will add this to selectmenu wiki.
[09:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: You should expect .gitattributes to be updated next week.
[09:41:00] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: nice!
[09:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:42:12] <jzaefferer> are there any blockers in jquery-release for jQuery UI?
[09:42:24] <jzaefferer> Or is it just a matter of migrating jQuery UI itself?
[09:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> Should just be a matter of migrating.
[09:42:49] <jzaefferer> Commit message parsing probably: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/issues/7
[09:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, there's the new commit message format.
[09:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/issues/7
[09:43:15] <jzaefferer> We don't publish to npm, so I think that's the only blocker
[09:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't be too hard to migrate.
[09:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's continue any other discussions in -dev.
[09:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
