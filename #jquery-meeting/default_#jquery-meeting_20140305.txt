[09:06:55] <scottgonzalez> But he's working on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1201 (just waiting on confirmation from Rafael that we don't need to make any changes in DB.
[09:06:55] <tj_vantoll1> Can someone share a link to the Google doc? I lost my link and finding things in Google docs is impossible.
[09:07:04] <scottgonzalez> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgyHrN8YnS0IdER6clpleEd6WnBrRTgybnhUSTVMRUE&usp=drive_web#gid=10
[09:07:10] <tj_vantoll1> Thanks
[09:07:14] <scottgonzalez> He also started working on the transition to jquery-release.
[09:07:21] <scottgonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1203
[09:07:30] <scottgonzalez> There's still plenty of work to do for that.
[09:07:34] <scottgonzalez> Mostly in jquery-release itself.
[09:07:47] <kborchers> tj_vantoll1: the link is in the topic too ;)

[09:09:25] <scottgonzalez> arschmitz: Anything to discuss for buttons right now?
[09:09:51] <arschmitz> no havent made much progress since last time with all the travel and mobile releases
[09:10:15] <scottgonzalez> ok
[09:10:28] <scottgonzalez> mikesherov: Anything to discuss regarding effects?
[09:10:45] <scottgonzalez> I know you're working on updates.
[09:13:03] <scottgonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:13:31] <tj_vantoll1> What left for 1.11? The effect rewrite, jquery-release, anything else?
[09:14:04] <scottgonzalez> We need to fix the quick download generation: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9743
[09:15:33] <tj_vantoll1> Ok. Were we going to split up core.js and widget.js into multiple modules as part of 1.11, or are we going to wait on that?
[09:15:52] <scottgonzalez> I just made the broken theme image ticket a blocker for 1.11.0 as well: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9759
[09:16:07] <scottgonzalez> I was going to, but I think we're going to leave that for 1.12.
[09:16:20] <scottgonzalez> Fewer things to worry about right now.
[09:16:37] <tj_vantoll1> Sounds good.
[09:20:01] <scottgonzalez> Anything else?
[09:24:12] <scottgonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
