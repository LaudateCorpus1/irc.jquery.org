[08:59:35] <mikesherov> .
[09:01:21] <DaveMethvin> ding
[09:01:24] <DaveMethvin> fries are done
[09:01:37] <rwaldron> yo
[09:01:46] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i just wrote up an explanation for that ticket
[09:01:52] <rwaldron> and closed "patchwelcome"
[09:02:07] <DaveMethvin> sounds good rwaldron
[09:02:12] <rwaldron> feel free to reuse the explanation in any other capacities
[09:02:12] <mikesherov> hi
[09:02:15] <gibson042> hello
[09:02:20] <rwaldron> hey dudes
[09:02:31] <DaveMethvin> okay seems like a good turnout today
[09:02:31] <mikesherov> oh, btw, I changed the "triage: assigned tickets" to be grouped by owner
[09:02:36] <mikesherov> PUBLIC SHAME WALL!
[09:02:39] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:02:50] <DaveMethvin> must be working for rwaldron he's been busy lately
[09:02:51] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:03:18] <DaveMethvin> okay, lots of agenda items but i think most are quick
[09:03:27] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:03:32] <rwaldron> :P
[09:03:32] <DaveMethvin> for your convenience
[09:03:51] <DaveMethvin> sooo, can we get 1.8.2 out this week?
[09:04:00] <rwaldron> I'm busy because I gave up using chrome with browserstack and started using firefox... so now it works and I can actually do stuff
[09:04:17] <DaveMethvin> the sizzle and delegated event regressions are holding people back
[09:04:19] <rwaldron> (this has been my blocker for 2 months)
[09:04:20] <DaveMethvin> and causing dup tickets
[09:04:35] <DaveMethvin> so if we can get 1.8.2 out i think we'll be good
[09:04:48] <rwaldron> +1
[09:04:59] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12009 has been labelled 1.9 in the PR queue, but 1.8.2 in the tracker
[09:05:06] <mikesherov> I can move to 1.9 in the tracker if you'd like
[09:05:11] <rwaldron> I have a patch that is probably low priority, but has been around since pre 1.8
[09:05:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's move any non-critical stuff to 1.9
[09:05:42] <rwaldron> sounds good
[09:05:58] <DaveMethvin> we may  need a 1.8.3 down the line if someone finds something big but i am hoping we can focus on 1.9/2.0 for the next few months
[09:06:02] <mikesherov> find corrupting the stack is not crit? I suppose you then mean, only regressions?
[09:06:17] <DaveMethvin> that find bug has been around for a good long time
[09:06:21] <mikesherov> I get it
[09:06:22] <rwaldron> mikesherov ithink he was talking about my ticket?
[09:06:29] <mikesherov> so only high priority regressions
[09:06:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah, regressions are the main thing
[09:06:44] <mikesherov> rwaldron: "http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12009 has been labelled 1.9 in the PR queue, but 1.8.2 in the tracker"
[09:06:46] <rwaldron> who here is actively working on API docs?
[09:06:51] <mikesherov> OK, moving it in the tracker then
[09:06:56] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10977
[09:06:59] <rwaldron> grab this
[09:07:01] <rwaldron> <3
[09:07:03] <mikesherov> I'm not actively, but can if it needs help
[09:07:31] <DaveMethvin> at some point we should run through and change the needsdocs to tickets in the docs repo
[09:07:42] <DaveMethvin> but until we switched that to github i found it easier to just DO IT
[09:07:49] <rwaldron> I'm asking for a bailout on that because I'm no longer familiar with the API docs editting process
[09:07:59] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin, I did some of them, I can do another run through to make sure
[09:08:00] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin easier?
[09:08:02] <DaveMethvin> so i am hoping once everything settles we can go back to tweaking the docs simply
[09:08:08] <rwaldron> ok
[09:08:35] <DaveMethvin> well rather than just moving them to the new tracker, i meant just edit the docs and remove the "needsdocs"
[09:08:53] <mikesherov> Oh, so, submit PR's against the docs?
[09:08:57] <mikesherov> I can do THAT
[09:09:02] <DaveMethvin> is anyone working on the docs tickets over in that tracker? I haven't looked
[09:09:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin got it
[09:09:15] <mikesherov> wait a sec...
[09:09:17] <DaveMethvin> i don't want to just move something from pile to pile if it is nearly as easy to do the work
[09:09:31] <DaveMethvin> but at the moment i am not even sure HOW to do the work :)
[09:09:46] <mikesherov> Tickets that have no development left shouldn't be open
[09:09:52] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:09:55] <mikesherov> if it's just a docs issue, it should be a docs ticket
[09:09:56] <DaveMethvin> closed/needsdocs
[09:10:11] <gibson042> +1 to that
[09:10:42] <mikesherov> so, I'll port that one over to the docs tracker, rwaldron
[09:10:54] <rwaldron> rad
[09:11:11] <DaveMethvin> some of these changes are like, a sentence or two, if the ticket in the docs tracker could suggest some language that would help
[09:11:20] <DaveMethvin> or be a real pull request
[09:11:24] <DaveMethvin> with changes to the docs page
[09:11:48] <mikesherov> I can
[09:11:53] <DaveMethvin> but again i find the whole process much less easy, maybe because i havent been through it for a while
[09:11:58] <mikesherov> I just want to clean up the tracker though
[09:12:09] <mikesherov> and then I can blast through the api docs tracker
[09:12:22] <DaveMethvin> sure if you want to do it that way
[09:12:36] <DaveMethvin> i just don't want to move our messy room to their messy room and declare victory :D
[09:12:40] <mikesherov> that's what works best for me
[09:12:48] <mikesherov> I like blasting through one queue at a time
[09:13:07] <mikesherov> I don't mind the overhead of copying tixx around, it makes it clearer for the rest of the core team what CODE needs to be written
[09:13:08] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 the main things left for 1.8.2 are sizzle things
[09:13:13] <mikesherov> which is what we should focus on
[09:13:19] <DaveMethvin> i saw that you did a new pull request
[09:13:28] <DaveMethvin> has timmywil had a chance to look at it?
[09:13:36] <DaveMethvin> it would be good to land all that and see what we have
[09:13:56] <timmywil> hi
[09:14:01] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:14:01] <gibson042> yeah, mostly the issues were so deep that they just went into https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/151
[09:14:14] <gibson042> but there was at least one that was independent enough to merit its own pull
[09:14:18] <gibson042> hey timmywil
[09:14:43] <DaveMethvin> so if you guys could get that stuff landed today/tomorrow that would be ultra fine
[09:14:52] <mikesherov> nothing would be finer
[09:15:20] <timmywil> gibson042: do we need 153 if we land 151?
[09:15:32] <timmywil> gibson042: also, you didn't the perf loss?
[09:15:42] <gibson042> I would say yes to 153
[09:15:53] <DaveMethvin> once the sizzles land to fix those regressions i think we have everything we currently need for 1.8.2
[09:16:11] <mikesherov> dmethvin, you sure?: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.8.2&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&order=priority
[09:16:24] <timmywil> ah I see, it's just a refactor of child
[09:16:28] <gibson042> and I saw some perf loss where expected, but gains in other areas so it seemed like a wash
[09:16:30] <gibson042> yep
[09:16:40] <DaveMethvin> well, and a new bug tracker ... still waiting on that report mikesherov
[09:16:55] <timmywil> gibson042: where did you expect it?
[09:16:56] <mikesherov> The TPS report is processing
[09:17:09] <timmywil> gibson042: POS?
[09:17:33] <gibson042> :not mostly, since there's a new decision point to differentiate set-based vs. element-based sub-matching
[09:17:58] <timmywil> ah, well that may answer one my concerns
[09:18:13] <DaveMethvin> those are all sizzle pulls mikesherov so yeah i think we're good
[09:18:30] <DaveMethvin> i marked that one a blocker just to not forget it
[09:18:39] <DaveMethvin> but nobody has replied so i'll prolly just close it
[09:18:43] <mikesherov> but they are all in 1.8.2 milestone
[09:18:45] <mikesherov> and 4 are open?
[09:19:04] <mikesherov> just want to make sure we're on the same page here
[09:19:18] <gibson042> everyone, any thoughts on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12545 ? it is a regression, and potentially big if people were anchoring on id
[09:19:21] <DaveMethvin> do any of those look like they must land?
[09:19:44] <gibson042> timmywil: it reduces the size of the set sent to set matchers by pulling out things that failed at an earlier point
[09:20:00] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: that's a regression but because I should have had that totally fixed in 1.8.0
[09:20:22] <DaveMethvin> i do think we want to stick with our 1.8.1 behavior, but it does act differently
[09:20:26] <DaveMethvin> so we need to document that
[09:20:45] <DaveMethvin> this is another case of one person's bug being another's feature
[09:21:02] <timmywil> gibson042: can we refactor at all to get rid of the function?
[09:21:02] <gibson042> I seem to remember past advice to use precisely that pattern, though
[09:21:34] <DaveMethvin> so someone will be unhappy
[09:21:48] <gibson042> i.e., .on("event", "#anchor ...", handler) instead of .on("event", "> ...", handler) since the latter wasn't possible until recently
[09:21:50] <timmywil> if you're confident about it, I'm willing to have it, but I'm sad about the addition of a private function
[09:21:59] <DaveMethvin> we either say that delegated events are always from document and piss off the people who expect it to be rooted at the delegate target
[09:22:01] <DaveMethvin> or vice versa
[09:22:29] <DaveMethvin> i like the way it works right now, but agree it's a breaking change
[09:22:38] <timmywil> gibson042: actually, it's only necessary for POS isn't it?
[09:22:41] <gibson042> timmywil: I don't see an easy way to factor it out before 1.8.2
[09:22:47] <gibson042> right
[09:22:51] <timmywil> ok, then fine
[09:22:59] <timmywil> we can refactor later if we want
[09:23:03] <gibson042> yeah
[09:23:14] <gibson042> I tried to keep stuff like that in the POS codepath
[09:23:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'll land those pulls after work tonight
[09:23:47] <DaveMethvin> so on the other 1.8.2-tagged bugs, are there any that really need to go there? I was going to re-tag them 1.9
[09:23:59] <DaveMethvin> sorry i didn't do that earlier
[09:24:29] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12423 ?
[09:24:33] <timmywil> gibson042: thanks btw, you handled a lot ;)
[09:24:44] <DaveMethvin> i think that could be fixed but it's not a regression
[09:25:00] <gibson042> you're more than welcome; my only regret is the size increase
[09:25:25] <DaveMethvin> don't worry gibson042 we'll get it back in 1.9
[09:25:27] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:26:02] <DaveMethvin> okay, assigned tix
[09:26:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we'll see, we should probably be supporting the rest of the css3 selectors at this point :P
[09:26:45] <DaveMethvin> okay, you have a 20-byte budget for that timmywil :D
[09:26:56] <DaveMethvin> as the agenda says, let's only grab tix if we're going to work on them soon
[09:27:07] <timmywil> heh, well I'm hoping we can address most of them with another child refactor
[09:27:07] <DaveMethvin> that way we have a better idea of what is actually going to be done
[09:27:37] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf suggested we do a weekly status on assigned tix
[09:27:47] <DaveMethvin> which makes sense just to see what progress is happening
[09:28:01] <DaveMethvin> so if you have 3 dozen tix assigned you might want to get going :)
[09:28:13] <DaveMethvin> or unassign yourself from a few
[09:28:18] <timmywil> for 1.9?
[09:28:24] <DaveMethvin> for any, really
[09:28:33] <mikesherov> sure
[09:28:37] <mikesherov> that makes sense
[09:28:40] <timmywil> ok, I'm kinda working by milestone here
[09:28:40] <DaveMethvin> but yeah we're coming up on 1.9/2.0 territory
[09:29:00] <mikesherov> you don't have to give them up, but it's good to touch base in case someone else is light and can take tixx
[09:29:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah, especially ones that are relatively standalone
[09:29:29] <mikesherov> I know I have a few tix I've held onto forever that are worth reviewing
[09:30:00] <DaveMethvin> i mean, only gibson042 and timmywil would even attempt a ticket named "Rewrite Sizzle for the fifth time" :P
[09:30:26] <timmywil> I think gibson042 and I want to avoid that ticket
[09:30:34] <timmywil> :)
[09:30:37] <gibson042> timmywil: hell yes
[09:30:41] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:30:46] <DaveMethvin> wimps
[09:30:57] <DaveMethvin> so assuming we squeeze 1.8.2 out, we are at 1.9 time
[09:31:03] <rwaldron> a good portion of my tickets are 2.0 focused, that I have historic context for
[09:31:17] <DaveMethvin> hey, no 2.0 fun until you eat your 1.9!!!!
[09:31:25] <rwaldron> when we dig in they should be added to vote pool or whatever
[09:31:35] <mikesherov> Yeah
[09:31:37] <rwaldron> well, I'm working through 1.9 now
[09:31:52] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov you mentioned oldIE support for 1.9
[09:31:54] <mikesherov> So I have one comment on the strategy of only majors for 1.8.2
[09:32:02] <DaveMethvin> ga mikesherov
[09:32:25] <mikesherov> it means we need to define a touch AFTER 1.8.2 when we decide to split off a branch for 1.9 vs. 2.0
[09:32:56] <mikesherov> because there a bunch of bugs to clean up that we know of, and why do the work after the split
[09:33:11] <DaveMethvin> yes, i'd think we'd land any common tix before we split
[09:33:26] <mikesherov> prob not a big deal, but we should set an internal milestone, not correlated to an actual release that we assign tixx to
[09:33:41] <rwaldron> +1
[09:33:43] <timmywil> that would make sense
[09:33:47] <mikesherov> and bust our ass on those before the split
[09:33:49] <rwaldron> I always figured thats how it would work
[09:33:56] <mikesherov> sure, I'm the new guy
[09:33:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah, good to say it out loud
[09:34:00] <rwaldron> glad we're saying it outloud
[09:34:02] <mikesherov> so just making sure :-)
[09:34:04] <rwaldron> thanks mikesherov
[09:34:07] <timmywil> that's probably a good thing to focus on for the hackathon as well
[09:34:13] <mikesherov> timmywil +1
[09:34:18] <mikesherov> clean up before the big split
[09:34:53] <DaveMethvin> so perhaps we can do the split after the hackathon
[09:34:55] <rwaldron> yikes
[09:35:01] <rwaldron> i need to grab food before i get on a client call
[09:35:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: +1
[09:35:08] <rwaldron> mikesherov thanks for the re-org of the tickets <3
[09:35:09] <DaveMethvin> k thanks rwaldron
[09:35:14] <mikesherov> NP, rwaldron
[09:35:18] <timmywil> don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves
[09:35:24] <rwaldron> I'm going to keep working on whatever I can get out of the way
[09:35:32] <mikesherov> right, me too
[09:35:37] <rwaldron> now that i have browserstack working again, holyshit yay
[09:35:39] <rwaldron> ;)
[09:35:50] <DaveMethvin> even if we do 2.0 code at the hackathon it shouldn't be hard to merge
[09:36:15] <mikesherov> sure, but I'm def going to be working on pre big split stuff
[09:36:26] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: mmmmm, it's going to be a mess regardless of when we split. I wouldn't mind putting as much work as we can into minimizing that mess.
[09:36:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, there are all kinds of plumbing things we have to work out
[09:37:07] <DaveMethvin> like we need a different set of browsers in jenkins for that branch
[09:37:12] <DaveMethvin> all pretty solvable i think
[09:37:17] <DaveMethvin> just has to be done
[09:37:28] <DaveMethvin> anyway, 1.9 voting
[09:37:45] <DaveMethvin> don't bother tagging stuff for a vote that is just gonna get done
[09:37:52] <DaveMethvin> it's mostly about controversial stuff
[09:38:11] <DaveMethvin> if you think it *needs* to be discussed or is a feature addition, then let's vote that
[09:38:29] <DaveMethvin> so try to tag everything for a vote by next Monday and we can vote following that
[09:39:07] <DaveMethvin> so that's all i have
[09:39:13] <DaveMethvin> anybody have other issues/
[09:39:14] <DaveMethvin> ?
[09:39:29] <timmywil> not me
[09:39:34] <mikesherov> um.
[09:39:48] <timmywil> at least not JQUERY issue
[09:39:49] <DaveMethvin> i will update the 1.8.2 tix to reflect reality
[09:39:55] <timmywil> :)
[09:39:56] <mikesherov> OK, great
[09:40:02] <mikesherov> That's all I had
[09:40:10] <gibson042> nothing more here
[09:40:14] <DaveMethvin> ok, thanks guys!
