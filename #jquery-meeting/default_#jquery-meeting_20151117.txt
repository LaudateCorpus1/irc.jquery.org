[14:01:53] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, kristyjy, arthurvr
[14:03:14] <arschmitz> hey
[14:03:57] <sfrisk> hey
[14:04:00] <sfrisk> might just be you and me
[14:04:02] <arschmitz> and que crickets
[14:04:05] <sfrisk> kristyjy has a meeting
[14:04:07] <arschmitz> queue
[14:04:14] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:04:16] <sfrisk> and geekman-rohit was going to bed, but was having some stuff for us soon
[14:04:24] <arschmitz> cool
[14:05:04] <sfrisk> I added in a PR to upgrade JSCS
[14:05:24] <sfrisk> maybe this should just become a biweekly meeting
[14:06:02] <arschmitz> the turn out would justify the change
[14:06:14] <arschmitz> i just fear it may slow progress even furhter then already
[14:06:17] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:06:20] <sfrisk> bahhhh
[14:06:32] <sfrisk> well we'll try it at this time for a few more weeks
[14:06:38] <sfrisk> I started the buttons pr locally
[14:06:48] <arschmitz> nice
[14:06:48] <sfrisk> just need to get it to a PR-able point
[14:07:04] <sfrisk> would have done more last night, but there was a cat poop situation
[14:07:37] <arschmitz> im getting two kitties for new house
[14:07:41] <arschmitz> this weekend
[14:07:41] <sfrisk> yay!
[14:07:44] <sfrisk> kitties!
[14:08:05] <sfrisk> I might actually do the initial PR as button variables, to tie in with "this is how we want JSCS variables to work"
[14:08:24] <arschmitz> cool
[14:08:25] <sfrisk> hash out best practices in that PR
[14:08:36] <arschmitz> makes sense
[14:08:37] <sfrisk> while I work on the rest of buttons separately
[14:08:50] <sfrisk> Okay, I'll do that then
[14:09:42] <sfrisk> I can test https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/111 while I'm at it
[14:09:57] <sfrisk> to do some automatic prefixing
[14:10:51] <arschmitz> oh so geekman has asked why the indentation fix to the jquery style guide in jscs was removed
[14:11:01] <sfrisk> ... huh?
[14:11:04] <arschmitz> its because it was more or less unenforcable in practice
[14:11:14] <arschmitz> inforcing tabs vs spaces
[14:11:31] <arschmitz> was removed from the jquery preset in jscs the thing he was updating jscs partially for
[14:11:48] <sfrisk> okay, I had wondered why I hadn't seen any spaces/tabs flags
[14:12:02] <arschmitz> so we can enable it still in our config
[14:12:04] <sfrisk> when I upgraded grunt-jscs to 2.3
[14:12:18] <sfrisk> I can add that to the PR
[14:12:21] <arschmitz> it may not be a problem for us but in general it can be hard to enforce properly
[14:13:42] <sfrisk> well, we could add it in, since it's definitely a problem we've seen in PRs
[14:14:01] <sfrisk> and if it becomes an unusable feature, we'll remove it and find a less automated way to deal with tabs/spaces
[14:23:04] <sfrisk> okay, well I think I'm going to call the meeting there
