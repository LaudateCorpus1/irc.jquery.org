[09:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano thinks I know how to use IRC...
[09:00:45] <ajpiano> feels like one of those

[09:00:47] <ajpiano> moments to me
[09:00:47] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from diveintomark: I can code 6502 assembly without an assembler, but I can't decode my son's text messages. ★ http://bit.ly/oU2h1N
[09:02:50] <jzaefferer> let's get this started then
[09:03:06] <jzaefferer> danheberden?
[09:03:57] <jzaefferer> danheberden: infrastructure? public repo?
[09:05:30] <jzaefferer> nope?
[09:05:34] <jzaefferer> rworth: anything on docs?
[09:05:39] <rworth> nope
[09:05:46] <ajpiano> who has access to the frontpage of jqueryui.com
[09:05:52] <ajpiano> i have some packt books that need to get up there
[09:05:55] <jzaefferer> gnarf: anything on testing animations?
[09:06:03] <rworth> ajpiano: do you have website svn?
[09:06:15] <ajpiano> no
[09:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> I can do it
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: connect with me after the meeting
[09:06:29] <rworth> scott_gonzalez scott_gonzalez he's your man
[09:06:37] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: aight thanks
[09:07:53] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: seems like that dialog issue isn't new at all, right?
[09:08:06] <jzaefferer> if it isn't a regression, let's fix it in 1.9, end of story
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> no, it's not a regression
[09:08:31] <jzaefferer> unlikely everything we change in datepicker...
[09:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> it just seems like an oversight, but I wanted to verify everyone agreed
[09:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so if everyone agrees, we'll mark the ticket valid and fix for 1.9
[09:09:43] <jzaefferer> yeah, the regular box model sucks, so we should work around it where ever possible..
[09:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> so yeah, datepicker regression
[09:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7686
[09:10:09] <jzaefferer> :/
[09:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> opening a datepicker from the close event of another datepicker causes an infinite loop
[09:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> this is the commit that caused it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/bdd2362754705628c7d5ad9a1b2edc8269c05e6c#ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js
[09:10:18] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by jzaefferer (3m, 2w ago): Merge remote branch 'kzys/trac-6656'
[09:10:55] <jzaefferer> the actual commit, not just the merge commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2063a113d6dbae006413896a93d46a34ebc9b155
[09:10:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kzys (4m, 2d ago): Datepicker: onClose callback should be triggered by show. Fixed #6656 - onClose event not triggered.
[09:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> so the problem is on close, we call show
[09:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> and show triggers the close event
[09:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> which then calls show...
[09:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> We can revert the fix or we can work around this
[09:12:18] <danheberden> sry, had to step away for a bit
[09:12:22] <jzaefferer> actually, its about closing already open datepickers when opening another one
[09:12:24] <danheberden> no scott_gonzalez nothing public yet
[09:12:31] <jzaefferer> the onclose-onclose was there before
[09:12:36] <jzaefferer> that didn't really change
[09:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: it's not about closing, it's about triggering the close event
[09:13:02] <jzaefferer> so opening another datepicker closes itself opens itself...?
[09:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> if you have two datepickers attached to text fields
[09:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> click on the first text field and the datepicker shows
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> without choosing a date, click on the second text field
[09:13:35] <jzaefferer> right, but only for the on close triggered when opening another one
[09:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> before the dialog didn't trigger teh close event
[09:13:48] <jzaefferer> this is actually new, introducing the issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2063a113d6dbae006413896a93d46a34ebc9b155#L2R612
[09:13:49] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kzys (4m, 2d ago): Datepicker: onClose callback should be triggered by show. Fixed #6656 - onClose event not triggered.
[09:13:56] <jzaefferer> this existed before: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2063a113d6dbae006413896a93d46a34ebc9b155#L2L779
[09:13:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kzys (4m, 2d ago): Datepicker: onClose callback should be triggered by show. Fixed #6656 - onClose event not triggered.
[09:17:53] <jzaefferer> anyway, needs to be debugged and fixed for 1.8
[09:18:13] <scott_gonzalez> any volunteers?
[09:18:47] <kborchers> i can take a look
[09:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> let me know if you need help
[09:19:05] <kborchers> ok
[09:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: what's the status of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/419/ ?
[09:19:35] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by inukshuk (1m, 4d ago): Positions: added conditional suppression of position rounding
[09:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> on a related note, dialog position tests are failing (off by 1px)
[09:20:03] <jzaefferer> I guess we're waiting for an update from the author?
[09:20:04] <scott_gonzalez> this might fix that
[09:20:38] <kborchers> i commented on the pull and was hoping he would fix it. the pr fixes IE off by one and chrome continues to work but it breaks the fraction test in FF
[09:21:10] <jzaefferer> I'm posting another comment
[09:21:27] <kborchers> FF doesn't like https://github.com/inukshuk/jquery-ui/commit/43115ae531c05cf8b26964949a84a4f14a8c7cf8#L0R257
[09:21:28] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by inukshuk (1m, 4d ago): Position: added test whether jQuery.offset supports fractions and suppresses rounding if it does
[09:21:56] <kborchers> document.body is null ... looked at it quickly and didn't find a better soultion but i can keep looking if we don't hear back from him
[09:22:21] <jzaefferer> seems like a common issue in support tests - how does Core do it?
[09:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> core creates a fake body
[09:22:54] <kborchers> ok, i can try that
[09:23:08] <kborchers> i'll check the dialog tests as well
[09:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:23:54] <jzaefferer> I still haven't reviewed the menu PRs
[09:24:34] <kborchers> and i haven't had much time to finish up the input menu extension either
[09:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:25:09] <jzaefferer> hey, the 419 guy just responded to my ping
[09:25:14] <jzaefferer> "Absolutely. I'll take a look at it later tonight."
[09:25:23] <jzaefferer> so kborchers, don't bother today
[09:25:26] <kborchers> ok
[09:27:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: about tabs meeting, I can help coordinate with Felix and Hans, but I likely won't be able to join at their available time next week
[09:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm finishing up the post about the download builder right now
[09:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> will send after this meeting
[09:29:08] <jzaefferer> Hans isn't around this week, I hope we get the datepicker update next week
[09:29:34] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: Maybe tweet from @jqueryui with a link to the post once it's out?
[09:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:30:04] <jzaefferer> do you have access to the account by now?
[09:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[09:30:41] <rworth> or I can do it
[09:30:46] <rworth> or I can give you access
[09:30:49] * scott_gonzalez opens 1Password
[09:30:55] <jzaefferer> let's get Scott access
[09:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> I have it
[09:31:02] <rworth> yay
[09:32:55] <jzaefferer> quick update on testswarm:
[09:33:04] <jzaefferer> Jenkins is running and connected to TestSwarm
[09:33:36] <jzaefferer> I've started adding QUnit to TestSwarm, which is currently blocked by bad RewriteRules in a .htaccess in the git/index.php serving the versioned files
[09:33:48] <jzaefferer> haven't yet figured that out, but might be close
[09:33:58] <jzaefferer> once that works, I also want to test adding jquery-mobile
[09:34:25] <jzaefferer> if we can get them on board, Filament Group might be much more interested (or Adobe) in helping set up clients
[09:34:29] <jzaefferer> and keeping them active
[09:34:36] <jzaefferer> which still needs to be automated
[09:35:21] <jzaefferer> there's also jq-jenkins in #jqueryui-dev, it'll send updates about broken builds
[09:35:25] <jzaefferer> eventually about passing builds, too
[09:35:50] <jzaefferer> can be configured per job, so it'll ping #jquery-dev for core, #jqueryui-dev for ui etc.
[09:36:10] <jzaefferer> I need to introduce at least one other dev to Jenkins management
[09:36:30] <jzaefferer> most of the stuff is pretty easy, you should create an account if you're interested: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/
[09:36:53] <jzaefferer> that's about it for now
[09:41:53] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez danheberden rworth: any comments on that?
[09:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> which part :-P
[09:42:27] <jzaefferer> everything
[09:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> the automation is awesome
[09:42:44] <jzaefferer> I haven't even enabled the 'poll repository' yet
[09:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> we really need to get more reliable clients
[09:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> we've been saying that for a long time
[09:43:25] <jzaefferer> yeah, I'd like to get FG invested, then ask them to donate or to give them money to buy hard- and software and put it in their office
[09:43:42] <jzaefferer> kinda likely for them to have some idles machines around anyway
[09:43:52] <jzaefferer> or we get back to rworth proposal of a heavy duty machine for VMs
[09:44:01] <jzaefferer> prolly should be a Mac server to test OSX
[09:44:21] <jzaefferer> if we actually need it
[09:44:30] <jzaefferer> we may be able to get away with just Windows VMs
[09:44:41] <jzaefferer> runs pretty much all browsers, doesn't it?
[09:46:04] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez
[09:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> we should just run them on (mt) servers
[09:47:22] <rworth> yeah
[09:47:55] <jzaefferer> that requires infrastructure support, setting up the VMs and remote access to them
[09:48:07] <jzaefferer> and figuring out the licensing issue
[09:48:24] <jzaefferer> we need to test IEs, so we need windows VMs
[09:48:38] <rworth> licensing issue is same whether or not we use VMs
[09:48:42] <jzaefferer> can we give someone money to plan and implement that?
[09:49:00] <rworth> might be worth talking to Bocoup
[09:49:26] <jzaefferer> rworth, do you want to start that discussion?
[09:49:35] <rworth> sure
[09:49:42] <jzaefferer> wouldn't want another plugins-site-situation...
[09:50:10] <jzaefferer> based on the exprience with that and downloadbuilder, we shouldn't waste time trying to get it donated
[09:50:28] <jzaefferer> work together to figure out the tasks, put an amount on it, get it done
[09:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to hear the proposal for knowing when the browsers are properly connected
[09:51:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: was does that mean?
[09:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> the only thing I could imagine us paying for is software that ensures all browsers are always connected
[09:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> how is that software going to work?
[09:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> I would imagine it would have to be implemented per OS and interacting directly with the applications
[09:52:48] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:53:08] <rworth> do we really need more than Windows?
[09:53:38] <rworth> didn't testswarm drop OSes ages ago?
[09:54:12] <rworth> I don't know how it's going to work, but from my experience the only way to keep IE running is to reset it every few hours
[09:54:32] <rworth> so it might make sense to just script the browser to launch on startup and have a script to restart the machine a few times a day
[09:55:00] <jzaefferer> if we stick with windows, we need a window programmer that knows enough about scripting processes...
[09:55:13] <jzaefferer> selenium and similar tools could provide valuable references
[09:55:52] <rworth> I've done application automation in windows, scripting mouse and keyboard and automated testing of UI states, etc.
[09:57:57] <jzaefferer> we you're usually pretty busy, no? but sounds like you could manage someone doing the implementation work, review the estimates and results...
[09:58:20] <rworth> I am indeed, thought I may have more time through Bocoup than otherwise, can't speak for them
[09:58:29] <rworth> and yes, I'd be happy to oversee someone
[09:59:01] <jzaefferer> so, who knows some windows programmers?
[09:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> we have some at appendTo
[10:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure
[10:01:15] <jzaefferer> if they're not involved with jQuery currently, we shouldn't have a problem with the SFC, right?
[10:01:31] <rworth> no
[10:01:48] <rworth> ok, grid meeting time
[10:02:12] <rworth> though let's give brad and boris a minute to arrive
[10:02:19] <jzaefferer> no Boris or Brad around
[10:02:22] <rworth> hey JohnAyers
[10:02:33] <rworth> jzaefferer: they typically enter a few minutes after the hour
[10:02:37] <JohnAyers> hola
[10:02:52] <jzaefferer> hey JohnAyers
[10:02:58] <JohnAyers> hi
[10:03:22] <rworth> hey borismoore , do you know if we're expecting brad today?
[10:03:50] <borismoore> not sure
[10:04:01] <borismoore> I would have expected him to be here.
[10:04:05] <rworth> ok, let's get started then
[10:04:11] <borismoore> He didn't contact me
[10:04:13] <rworth> borismoore: any update on template?
[10:04:31] <jzaefferer> well, Brad just sent an update on bracketing and pbworks claims he's editing the wiki
[10:04:44] <jzaefferer> this page: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41891169/Grid-Editing-API
[10:04:50] <borismoore> I was held up quite a bit on ms meetings and work, but have begun to pick up on the logicless
[10:05:05] <borismoore> Should be making progress in the next few days
[10:05:11] <rworth> great, thanks
[10:05:48] <borismoore> no details to report at this point
[10:06:57] <rworth> ok, I'd like us to set some goals for what we'll have to show the world in 3 weeks at the conferenec
[10:07:16] <rworth> Jörn and I started this discussion a bit in the last week or two
[10:07:42] <rworth> basically continue to focus on what is still open from Stage 3 but also do some integration with some earlier bits
[10:08:03] <rworth> like I've got an open task to incorporate markup from Stage 1 into the latest editing demos
[10:08:11] <jzaefferer> We already started bringing some demos into a state where they are more demoable
[10:09:58] <jzaefferer> The editing stuff still needs some of that attention
[10:11:19] <jzaefferer> Worth discussing: How much do we care about the table-specific components planned for stage 4? It seems like the whole area of data binding generally is much more interesting
[10:11:38] <jzaefferer> with jsviews, knockoutjs, addons for backbone and whatever else gets released daily
[10:12:06] <jzaefferer> borismoore JohnAyers rworth: what do you think?
[10:12:32] <JohnAyers> i tend to agree
[10:12:38] <rworth> I'm definitely in favor of deferring those, not that we won't do them, but that we could have a useful release before they're started
[10:12:39] <borismoore> For data binding, I think it would be great to have a clearer sense of jQuery UI (not just the Grid) requirements
[10:13:07] <borismoore> I'm ok for deferring some Grid specific pieces
[10:13:38] <borismoore> in favor of determining data binding requirements and scenarios, and beginning to integrate db into Grid
[10:13:46] <JohnAyers> me too
[10:13:54] <rworth> hey brado23
[10:14:00] <brado23> sorry I'm late :(
[10:14:19] <jzaefferer> JohnAyers: is wijmo doing anything in that direction already?
[10:15:10] <JohnAyers> we're getting a team together now
[10:15:10] <rworth> brado23: sent you the log till now via email
[10:15:31] <brado23> got it.  thx!
[10:15:54] <borismoore> For JsViews and JsRender, I have to figure my goals also for the conference
[10:15:58] <jzaefferer> getting a team together? does that mean you're just starting to research that?
[10:16:29] <JohnAyers> yes, we think that's a key missing piece of the client story
[10:17:25] <borismoore> What is your timeline?
[10:17:25] <jzaefferer> would be good to make that happen together with the grid effort
[10:17:59] <JohnAyers> absolutely.  we have a couple of guys freeing up in a couple of weeks...
[10:18:21] <rworth> borismoore: I know you may not have as much time as before, but it'd be great to get jQuery UI templates to a point where you could do JsViews on top of it, so half your talk would be about jQuery UI is doing and the other half about what you're doing
[10:18:36] <brado23> JohnAyers -- is this the same work that is looking at RIA/JS?  Getting on the same APIs with jQ Data Model?
[10:18:42] <rworth> (which we'll look at further down the road, as we've talked about)
[10:18:55] <borismoore> rworth - sure
[10:19:02] <JohnAyers> bardo32: yes
[10:19:25] <rworth> borismoore: but that means we need an implementation in 1 week not 3
[10:19:51] <borismoore> an implementation of what? Logicless with the new syntax
[10:19:56] <rworth> yes
[10:19:59] <borismoore> so you/I can demo that
[10:20:01] <borismoore> ?
[10:20:16] <borismoore> You want it in a week so you can then integrate in time?
[10:20:28] <brado23> In the spirit of getting db<->Grid, we could get on the same set of dataview/observable files for Grid / JsViews / RIA\JS and wijmo?
[10:20:38] <brado23> ...and demo around that
[10:20:43] <rworth> I'm not sure how quickly we can do so, I'm just saying it won't work if we don't see anything until the conference
[10:21:05] <rworth> but with 2-3 weeks we could make a lot of progress, atm we're holding on you
[10:22:00] <borismoore> I can work with my team to try to free up more time. Can't be certain how much that can be, for the next couple of weeks... But I'll do what I can...
[10:22:01] <rworth> borismoore: but yes, if we're able to, it'd be great to have an early release of jQuery UI template you can demo and talk about
[10:22:20] <rworth> borismoore: ok, thanks. And keep me updated
[10:23:16] <borismoore> JohnAyers, we could also sync up on your data binding requirements and scenarios, at Wijmo... I you would like...
[10:23:25] <borismoore> So we can try to align it all
[10:23:55] <JohnAyers> OK, I'll put something together
[10:25:24] <rworth> ok, let's plan on pulling together a concrete set of plans by next week's meeting
[10:25:51] <brado23> sounds good
[10:25:53] <rworth> on what we'll iterate/integrate on leading up to the conference
[10:26:14] <jzaefferer> to gather input on databinding, please use http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/43684051/Grid-Editing-Databinding
[10:28:34] <brado23> Do we want to Skype briefly to discuss further what could/not be achievable here?
[10:29:21] <rworth> my time is up, but I could meet at another time
[10:30:25] <brado23> What time works?  I'm typically available 9-12 PST.
[10:31:08] <rworth> Thu 9 PST?
[10:31:26] <borismoore> works for me
[10:31:42] <rworth> ok, join if you're able
[10:31:42] <brado23> sure
[10:31:44] <rworth> thanks everyone
[10:31:47] <jzaefferer> is that 9am PST?
[10:31:50] <rworth> yes
[10:31:56] <rworth> 12noon Eastern
[10:32:01] <jzaefferer> so tomorrow 6pm for me...
[10:32:06] <rworth> ok
[10:32:08] <jzaefferer> that probably won't work
[10:32:11] <rworth> oh
[10:32:15] <jzaefferer> so make sure to document your discussion :-)
[10:32:20] <rworth> sure thing
[10:32:23] <brado23> yep!
[10:32:32] <jzaefferer> going back to Cologne tomorrow, will focus a lot more on grid the next weeks
[10:32:42] <borismoore> Does it make sense to meet without Jorn :)
[10:32:55] <rworth> jzaefferer: would Fri work better?
[10:33:17] <jzaefferer> Friday 6pm could work
[10:33:25] <jzaefferer> already close to being a bad time...
[10:34:14] <jzaefferer> we'll probably have to stripe that discussion - you'll get together with the westcoast people, I'll talk with you...
[10:36:04] <rworth> let's stick with Thu then
[10:36:13] <rworth> and I'll talk with Jörn much earlier on Fri
[10:36:45] <rworth> or did you mean you and I talk early Fri and then I get with westcoast people later?
[10:37:59] <brado23> ...sorry...I have to run now.  I'll watch the IRC window to pick out the meeting time.  thx!!
[10:42:14] <JohnAyers> i need to run also
