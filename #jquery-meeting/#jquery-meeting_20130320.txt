[09:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov ngsilverman petersendidit rxaviers tj_vantoll
[09:00:24] <kborchers> yo
[09:00:28] <petersendidit> hey
[09:00:31] <tj_vantoll_phone> Hey
[09:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone!
[09:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's too much to discuss this week.
[09:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers fixed the intermittent issues with the versions field (hooray for async control flow).
[09:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> And we released 1.10.2.
[09:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> Since then rxaviers has fixed a few other bugs that cropped up from the UI rewrite.
[09:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to add rxaviers?
[09:03:27] <rxaviers> actually, there was the versions issue and the async one when producing icons. the versions was simply crawlers making requests I was not expecting.
[09:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right.
[09:04:08] <rxaviers> We had other two ugly regressions. Although, easy fix which is now live.
[09:04:26] <rxaviers> about the IE baseline, so we're going to stick with IE8?
[09:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:04:33] <rxaviers> ok
[09:04:43] <rxaviers> any one for firefox, safari, chrome?
[09:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> Curent - 1
[09:05:04] <rxaviers> ok
[09:05:14] <rxaviers> question
[09:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> For Firefox and Chrome that X.y.z.
[09:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> For Safari and Opera that's x.X.y
[09:05:35] <rxaviers> priority? a) IE8, then grunt cleanup?
[09:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that sounds good
[09:05:50] <rxaviers> cool ok
[09:06:09] <rxaviers> ah one more thing. this is minor, but
[09:06:24] <rxaviers> if you guys have a chance to take a look at
[09:06:24] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/222
[09:06:26] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #222 by rxaviers (1w 5d ago): Blog: tabular horizontal minimalist style
[09:06:37] <jzaefferer> hmpf
[09:06:44] <jzaefferer> stupid stupid DST stupid stupid
[09:06:45] <rxaviers> we'd be able to fnially publish that post
[09:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I'll be getting to that this week.
[09:06:50] <jzaefferer> figured I still have an hour ...
[09:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Probably tomorrow.
[09:06:53] <rxaviers> haha
[09:06:58] <rxaviers> np
[09:07:01] <rxaviers> thks
[09:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> Monday night, mikesherov and I got together and did a review of the effects rewrite.
[09:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> Clip animations are working well.
[09:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> We found some more work to do.
[09:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> But it's getting close.
[09:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> And I learned that .offset* properties are liars.
[09:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're rounded values.
[09:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> We spent way too long trying to figure out why things like elem.height( elem.height() ) was changing the size.
[09:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> I started reviewing interactions.
[09:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't get too far, but will continue with that.
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's about all I've got.
[09:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[09:11:08] <kborchers> i've been working on the pointer special event
[09:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, how's that coming along?
[09:11:46] <kborchers> actually pretty decent but a little stuck … mostly just copying the original event and modifying a bit to match the pointer spec for now
[09:12:04] <kborchers> mouse and touch work well … MSPoint is giving me issues though .. go figure :P
[09:12:10] <kborchers> MSPointer*
[09:12:12] <jzaefferer> I thought we're not working on that since the more low-level pointer events polyfill could work?
[09:12:21] <jzaefferer> well, apart from them having various issues
[09:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> We want to see what the size difference is and if we have fewer implementation issues since jQuery already handles lots of stuff for us.
[09:12:51] <kborchers> i thought we were still investigation both until we knew if the polyfill could actually support old IE
[09:13:26] <jzaefferer> okay, that makes sense
[09:13:59] <jzaefferer> Selectmenu hasn't seen any activity since last week, still looking for Scott to do the review.
[09:14:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'll push what i have later today so you can take a look
[09:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ok
[09:14:18] <kborchers> or maybe just gist it again
[09:14:18] <jzaefferer> Menubar was updated, Steven (@sgharms on github) is working on more bug fixes for the keyboard bindings
[09:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, I'm trying to get through the interaction stuff so I can shift my focus to selectmenu.
[09:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> Also trying to prevent sites from becomining stagnant though.
[09:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> As you saw this morning :-P
[09:15:14] <jzaefferer> I created a tiny survey for improving the UI site, we gathered 4 replies
[09:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of sites, we now have exposed permalinks for method signatures.
[09:15:24] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., http://api.jqueryui.com/show/#show-options
[09:15:38] <jzaefferer> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArIM4UVbwE-3dHRwMlhPQXR1YmwtYnNkcXBMbzZsc3c#gid=0 (except for Scott you'll have to request access)
[09:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, 4 users care about our sites :-P
[09:15:53] <jzaefferer> Well, I made two text areas required input
[09:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We could make it read-only to the world, right?
[09:16:09] <jzaefferer> ah, yes
[09:16:18] <jzaefferer> done
[09:16:38] <jzaefferer> second answer is basically asking back for the demo/api combo pages we had before 1.9
[09:17:05] <jzaefferer> first answer is looking for something like bootstrap, to style the rest of the page
[09:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> I think the first is really a tutorial for the learn site.
[09:18:39] <jzaefferer> We don't have any deep links from our site to the learn site, right?
[09:18:55] <jzaefferer> There's UI specific content on learn, but we don't link to it
[09:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, now that the site is actually live, we should add some links.
[09:20:11] <jzaefferer> So that was about B2/1.?
[09:20:21] <jzaefferer> The learning trails?
[09:21:07] <rxaviers> scott, do we have any work in progress migrating current wiki into a repo?
[09:21:40] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/39
[09:21:40] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #39 by jzaefferer (6s ago): Link to relevant learn articles
[09:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: not yet
[09:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like all of B2 is learn content.
[09:23:08] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:23:28] <jzaefferer> Any thoughs on C3? Aka oldschool demo/api combo pages?
[09:24:03] <jzaefferer> Sure, we want to have actual demos, but since we're not making progress on that, is there a simple intermediate step we can take to improve these pages?
[09:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> There's no step in between.
[09:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> Our API docs are ridiculously big.
[09:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> Putting them on jqueryui.com wouldn't be a good idea, IMO.
[09:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps we need someone good at information architecture...
[09:27:19] <jzaefferer> yeah, that might help
[09:27:29] <jzaefferer> Let's ask someone from GitHub :p
[09:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:29:41] <jzaefferer> oh well: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/115
[09:29:42] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #115 by jzaefferer (6s ago): Rethink widget docs
[09:30:08] <jzaefferer> B4 and C4 are both talking about composite demos that we don't yet have
[09:30:36] <jzaefferer> Not sure what to take away from that
[09:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's good input for when we do get to implementing new demos.
[09:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> That you should be able to filter based on multiple widgets.
[09:34:03] <jzaefferer> Okay, I'll put a note on that on the wiki page for Demos: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59810840/Demos
[09:34:36] <jzaefferer> B5, editing demos on jsbin or jsfiddle isn't really a new idea, but we never implemented it
[09:35:00] <jzaefferer> Having a "Edit on jsbin" link that creates a bin with the demo code seems like something we can do
[09:35:13] <jzaefferer> As long as we don't actually store anything in jsbin ourselve
[09:35:48] <scott_gonzalez> We can also just build editing into our site.
[09:36:04] <jzaefferer> Or that
[09:36:11] <scott_gonzalez> It depends on whether having a publicly saved version is beneficial.
[09:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> Pushing the user out of our site to play with a demo isn't great.
[09:37:24] <jzaefferer> Well, we could embed jsfiddle on demand? "Edit on jsfiddle" creates a jsfiddle template, then embeds that on the page?
[09:37:48] <jzaefferer> I don't think we want to create content on third-party sites when deploying our site, right?
[09:38:06] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely don't want to create content on other sites.
[09:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really like the embedded fiddles. jsFiddle is really flaky.
[09:38:39] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:39:06] <fnagel> how sad, jsFiddel works great with GitHubs gists
[09:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> Putting our demos in gists would be so horible.
[09:39:52] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/40
[09:39:55] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #40 by jzaefferer (9s ago): Allow editing of demos
[09:40:31] <jzaefferer> Finally there's C5: "Always showing left menu. If you're on the bottom of the page, you need to go to the top to select another widget / option"
[09:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh the humanity.
[09:40:50] <jzaefferer> We can set position:fixed, but that breaks down once the sidebar is longer then the page
[09:40:56] <jzaefferer> So we probably don't want to go there...
[09:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> We don't want to do anything.
[09:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> It takes one keystroke/tap to get to the top.
[09:42:27] <jzaefferer> That's all there is
[09:43:01] <jzaefferer> Since Scott is working on site issues, this should all be resolved by next week :p
[09:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:43:44] <jzaefferer> Guess we're done here?
[09:43:53] <scott_gonzalez> yup
