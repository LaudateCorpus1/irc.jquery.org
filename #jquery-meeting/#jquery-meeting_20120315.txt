[11:02:27] <toddparker> Hi all - the jQuery Mobile team meeting is about to start
[11:08:01] <abub> Hello folks, whats today link?
[11:08:06] <abub> *today's meeting link
[11:10:17] <gseguin> abub: https://plus.google.com/hangouts/2bd8c3c95a41cf755cf765fe32dc6ef44d904786
[11:11:12] <abub> thanks
[11:14:47] <toddparker> first off, we've discovered a really bad issue with android that makes selects not work with fixed toolbars
[11:15:04] <toddparker> so we're going to move out the rc until we have a solution
[11:15:05] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3712
[11:15:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3712 on jquery-mobile, reported by felipegs (1w, 6d ago): Select Box Android not working with fixed positioning
[11:20:36] <toddparker> we're refining the optional poly fill to restore the dynamic re-position script…needs a bit more work
[11:29:30] <toddparker> phone gap issue we're tracking
[11:29:31] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3768
[11:29:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3768 on jquery-mobile, reported by haroldneal-cap (1w, 1h ago): Double transitions with jqm 1.1-rc1 and phonegap 1.4.1 + fixed toolbars
[11:32:54] <toddparker> trying to get set up to debug this
[11:36:23] <toddparker> we have an auto build that pushes docs into a phone gap app for daily testing
[11:40:52] <gseguin> gseguin is working on the bundle builder
[11:41:15] <gseguin> good progress on css dependency map building
[11:43:33] <Wilto> Wilto is working on the previously mentioned Android/selects/fixed positioning bug.
[11:43:48] <Wilto> Wilto is also the coolest; pass it on.
[12:06:59] <toddparker> so I will do a blog post about the delay in rc2 so we can figure out a good fix for this android bug
[12:07:03] <toddparker> alright, thanks everyone
[13:37:13] <toddparker> looks like wilt might have one possible fix for that select issue
[13:44:45] <johnbender> toddparker: praise the loard
[13:44:51] <johnbender> s/loard/lord/
[13:45:03] <johnbender> though I think "loard" captures the phonetics better :D
[14:15:40] <toddparker> seriously
[14:15:51] <toddparker> we just need to see if the fix is worse than the disease
