[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: fnagel1 gnarf jzaefferer mikesherov
[09:01:22] <gnarf> low bandwidth - but hereish
[09:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, this will probably be a short meeting.
[09:01:45] <jzaefferer> hey
[09:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> hey jzaefferer, I thought you weren't going to show up :-P
[09:02:27] <jzaefferer> I know!
[09:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> I did some triage this morning.
[09:03:04] <fnagel1> hey
[09:03:14] <jzaefferer> anyone around who wants to talk about bower.json devDependencies?
[09:03:28] <jzaefferer> that explains the ticket drop
[09:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: If nobody's around, I'll discuss it with you after the meeting.
[09:04:18] <mikesherov_> here
[09:04:26] <mikesherov_> hit me by name if you need me
[09:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Right after last week's meeting, we dropped support for IE7 and Opera 12.1.x
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> They're gone from TestSwarm, resulting in a green build :-)
[09:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2579
[09:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> And all tickets only affecting those browsers were closed as wontfix.
[09:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, gnarf, and I did a review of mikesherov_'s effects rewrite PR.
[09:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> We found some issues that we'll be looking into.
[09:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> Probably means we need to increase test coverage.
[09:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> One thing I wanted to discuss is whether we should move transfer out of .effect() and into its own method.
[09:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> Since it can't be used for showing/hiding.
[09:07:45] <jzaefferer> yeah, it is an odd one
[09:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's just an effect, and an effect that doesn't even modify the original element.
[09:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> But it is one of the more useful effects.
[09:08:23] <mikesherov_> right
[09:08:37] <jzaefferer> It deserves its own demo
[09:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to moving it?
[09:09:28] <jzaefferer> What would the new API for transfer look like?
[09:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> Probably elem.transfer({ to: otherElem }) but we should figure out if there are additional options that should be added.
[09:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> Right now there's support for adding classes to the generated element.
[09:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> We might want to expose more control than that.
[09:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'll send an email to jquery-devs-team and ask for references to existing real world uses of this type of effect.
[09:13:07] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:13:14] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: perhaps for 1.11 though we can just pull it out as is
[09:13:20] <mikesherov_> and then in 1.12 add functionality
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:13:49] <mikesherov_> and I suppose I should backCompat .effect('transfer') for 1.11?
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:14:36] <mikesherov_> ok, by not .show('transfer'), which some people might be doing?
[09:14:47] <mikesherov_> even though it isn't a show effect?
[09:15:12] <Krinkle> Nice
[09:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> Can we just define the effect and just have it call .transfer()?
[09:17:10] <mikesherov_> yeah, sure... that works
[09:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, then that should cover all the uses.
[09:17:46] <mikesherov_> yeah
[09:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> After I work through some other stuff, I'll look into the issues we found.
[09:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer started working on the migration to jquery-release.
[09:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1203
[09:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:22:11] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: yeah, I'm a bit baffled, because I got all the visual tests working. We just need much much better unit test coverage, and perhaps even port the demos to visual tests as well
[09:22:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: don't forget about implicit duration option on transfer :)
[09:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yeah, most of the .animate() API will need to move into the option hash for .transfer().
[09:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> duration, easing, step, callback, etc.
[09:23:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: mikesherov_: we could make it have show and hide, based on "to" or "from"
[09:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> But showing and hiding don't make sense if the actual element isn't moving.
[09:23:58] <gnarf> because it could actually be a transfer from to open for instance
[09:24:11] <mikesherov_> gnarf: that's just animate though
[09:24:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but it is being hidden or shown based on state?
[09:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:24:30] <gnarf> after a transfer is over, does it call .hide()?
[09:24:34] <mikesherov_> gnarf: no
[09:24:36] <gnarf> oh well then screw it
[09:24:39] <mikesherov_> :-)
[09:24:45] <gnarf> $(target).transfer({ to: this })
[09:24:47] <mikesherov_> which is why .transfer is a special snowflake
[09:25:06] <jzaefferer> its more of an oddball
[09:25:38] * scott_gonzalez wonders how much code is required to manually create a transfer effect using .position()...
[09:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[09:29:41] <jzaefferer> There's a bunch of open PRs that need updates from me, others need feedback from the team
[09:29:51] <jzaefferer> But I think we're good for this meeting
[09:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok. Thanks everyone.
[09:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
