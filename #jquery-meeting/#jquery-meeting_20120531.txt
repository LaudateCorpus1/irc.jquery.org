[09:00:57] <jzaefferer> Hello testing people
[09:01:14] <jzaefferer> pinging rwaldron johnbender scott_gonzalez rworth Krinkle
[09:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[09:01:39] <jzaefferer> As before, I'd like to just do some ticket triaging: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues
[09:01:54] <jzaefferer> Some are still around, some new ones could use your input
[09:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:14] <jzaefferer> Though if Scott is the only one here, I might as well get with him on Skype :p
[09:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> Are we just going to go top ot bottom?
[09:02:38] <jzaefferer> top to bottom works, yeah
[09:02:55] <jzaefferer> brand new: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/252
[09:02:55] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #252 on qunit (mihneagiurgea; 1h, 3m ago): Filter enhancement
[09:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> lowercase comparison seems easy
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> filter by module seems easy too, but adding filters is tricky.
[09:04:18] <jzaefferer> yeah, and module filters would be nice, but there's no room for that right now
[09:04:28] <jzaefferer> That's somewhat related to https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/251
[09:04:29] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #251 on qunit (jzaefferer; 4d, 5h ago): Improve composite runner
[09:04:45] <jzaefferer> and duplicate of https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/246
[09:04:46] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #246 on qunit (jonnyreeves; 2w, 2d ago): Provide a link for re-running a single Module / TestGroup.
[09:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we can do module + filter combined
[09:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> And leave the new test-specific filter on its own.
[09:05:45] <jzaefferer> What do you mean with "module + filter combined"?
[09:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> module filtering would be something like ?module=foo
[09:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> And current filtering is filter=foo
[09:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> So we can support ?module=foo&filter=bar
[09:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> And filter on both at the same time.
[09:07:10] <jzaefferer> Ah, okay
[09:07:35] <jzaefferer> I don't think that's what the ticket implied
[09:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> Whereas the testNumber filter can't be combined with anything
[09:07:51] <jzaefferer> ?filter=module somewhat works
[09:08:00] <jzaefferer> but as for tests, isn't an exact match
[09:08:03] * rdworth a few min late, but here now
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Nested modules is probably a breaking change.
[09:09:24] <jzaefferer> The nesting could be just in the html output
[09:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> How do you define nested modules?
[09:09:52] <jzaefferer> Currently there's a flat list of tests
[09:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not talking about visually indenting the module.
[09:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm talking about the requested nesting.
[09:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> From #251
[09:10:41] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> I think the indenting from #252 and the rerun link from #246 can be implemented.
[09:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> But the nesting is probably going to break all existing test suites.
[09:11:37] <jzaefferer> yeah, actual nesting is too far off
[09:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so should we close the nesting ticket?
[09:12:50] <jzaefferer> #251?
[09:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> It also talks about life cycles though.
[09:13:16] <jzaefferer> Ignoring the suggestion, it would still be nice to improve the composite runner
[09:13:37] <jzaefferer> Having all tests of one suite in a single test isn't very useful
[09:14:07] <jzaefferer> What if we'd map modules and tests 1:1, prefixing each module with the suite's name?
[09:14:16] <jzaefferer> accordion:core, accordion:events etc
[09:14:44] <jzaefferer> Would be a better balance of scrolling through more tests, but less assertions
[09:14:50] * scott_gonzalez load our composite test
[09:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> How would that work?
[09:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have any insight into the individual test pages until they start running.
[09:17:27] <jzaefferer> we could call module() for each moduleStart event
[09:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what's wrong with the current setup.
[09:17:35] <rwaldron> Ok, I'm not going to the conf lunch
[09:17:40] <rwaldron> so I'm here. will read back
[09:17:41] <jzaefferer> and test() for each testStart
[09:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't that too late?
[09:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit is already running at that point.
[09:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> What problem are we trying to solve?
[09:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> Why do composite pages need any heirarchy at all?
[09:18:33] <jzaefferer> Currently the composite addon stuffs everything the iframe suite produces into a single test
[09:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[09:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> Why is that a problem?
[09:18:43] <jzaefferer> giving you a looong list of assertions from various tests
[09:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> Which you should never look at.
[09:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> They auto-collapse after running.
[09:19:32] <jzaefferer> So you're saying if a suite fails, just run it stand-alone to see what failed?
[09:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> No, there's a very handy checkbox for that.
[09:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> Click the hide passed tests checkbox and you'll see just the failures.
[09:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> And the test name will give you the correct file + module + test.
[09:21:05] <jzaefferer> Okay, I'll just include some of that in the composite readme and close the ticket with that
[09:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> At that point, you should switch to running just the one test file as you work on fixing the failure.
[09:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:22:11] <jzaefferer> okay, #251 is down, I can work on #252
[09:22:36] <jzaefferer> I need to look into this, too, sounds harmless though: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/250
[09:22:37] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #250 on qunit (vdboor; 1w, 6h ago): Expected Date value is not displayed properly in HEAD
[09:22:51] <jzaefferer> Any idea what to do here? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/249
[09:22:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #249 on qunit (DmitrySokolov; 1w, 2d ago): Text output for 'notXXX' assertions
[09:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> I don't get it.
[09:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> He wrote the opposite of what he wanted logged and then complained about it?
[09:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the expcted line.
[09:25:58] <jzaefferer> Currently all those assertions pass through their arguments to QUnit.push
[09:26:04] <jzaefferer> Which isn't aware of inverted assertions
[09:26:31] <jzaefferer> I never use notXXX, so I don't care that much...
[09:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's fine.
[09:27:42] <jzaefferer> Close as "worksforme"?
[09:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> The first thing you're going to do is look at the test.
[09:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok, next
[09:29:35] <jzaefferer> this is a fun one: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/239
[09:29:36] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #239 on qunit (jzaefferer; 3w, 6d ago): Better Phantomjs integration
[09:29:59] <jzaefferer> Skipping docs tickets and #246, which we covered before
[09:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yikes, let's come back to that.
[09:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> brb
[09:30:32] <jzaefferer> At this point I'd just like to close that ticket. The script is there as an addon, it works
[09:30:38] <jzaefferer> And I have no clue what his problem is
[09:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> back
[09:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm reading through all the comments.
[09:36:04] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: late, but here
[09:36:09] * johnbender is watching his daughter this mornin
[09:37:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just updated it
[09:37:15] <jzaefferer> though if you understand what his problem is, all the better
[09:37:25] <jzaefferer> hey johnbender
[09:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? Why is that gist so big?
[09:37:55] <jzaefferer> just ignore it
[09:38:10] <jzaefferer> I actually downloaded it, and ran it locally
[09:38:15] <jzaefferer> and still had no idea what was going on
[09:38:29] <scott_gonzalez> whatever
[09:38:32] <jzaefferer> there's still https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/227 and #226
[09:38:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on qunit by amb26 (1m, 3w ago): Patch and test case for #226 allowing cumulative issue of "expect" calls
[09:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> Closing it was fine.
[09:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't that a breaking change?
[09:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's not that hard to get the behavior he wants today.
[09:40:23] * scott_gonzalez var expected = 1;
[09:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> doSomething();
[09:40:31] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/226#issuecomment-5740524
[09:40:32] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #226 on qunit (amb26; 1m, 3w ago): Allow calls to "expect" within a single test to be cumulative
[09:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> expect( ++expected );
[09:40:54] <jzaefferer> "iii) Arguments based around expecting the test case author to mock up this feature of the testing framework manually whenever they want it are unhelpful. The testing framework has this feature (the ability to count the number of assertions) and it would be most helpful for it to be upgraded so that it covers more use cases for the user base."
[09:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let me read the whole coversation.
[09:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand that last complaint (the one you pasted)
[09:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll reply on the ticket.
[09:45:02] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[09:46:40] <jzaefferer> Skipping the logo ticket. Next is yours: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/207
[09:46:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #207 on qunit (scottgonzalez; 2m, 4w ago): Add option to require all tests to call expect()
[09:46:56] <jzaefferer> Ha, more expect() changes :p
[09:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> gah, I HATE MARKDOWN
[09:51:56] <scott_gonzalez> Why is my code block totally busted?
[09:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously I'm +1 for that :-)
[09:52:44] <jzaefferer> Wanna implement it?
[09:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> Sure.
[09:56:12] <jzaefferer> Closed the PR and also commented on #226
[09:56:40] <jzaefferer> I don't like this one, so much deprecation necessary: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/190
[09:56:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #190 on qunit (jzaefferer; 4m, 2w ago): Deprecate `module`, rename to `group`
[09:57:10] <jzaefferer> And as usual, only years later when we actually remove the old ones, will other projects update...
[09:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> So, umm...
[09:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> My response is "who cares about CommonJS?"
[09:59:34] <jzaefferer> What about the ecma module module?
[10:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> link?
[10:00:04] <jzaefferer> also using module keyword: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules
[10:00:12] <jzaefferer> or rather, making module a keyword
[10:00:17] <jzaefferer> and not just a variable
[10:00:32] <jzaefferer> Scroll to "Inline module declarations"
[10:00:42] <rwaldron> the ecma module and our module will work fine
[10:00:49] <rwaldron> (no one believes me)
[10:00:53] <rwaldron> but it's true.
[10:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Just like package?
[10:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: I believe you, there was a discussion on node about it.
[10:01:52] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: so we can ignore that? Any thoughts on node's module.exports vs QUnit's module?
[10:01:55] <rwaldron> ModuleDeclaration ::= "module" [NoNewline] Id "=" ModuleSpecifier ";"
[10:01:55] <rwaldron>                    |  "module" [NoNewline] Id "{" ModuleBody "}"
[10:01:59] <rwaldron> makes it work
[10:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You can opt-out of module in QUnit, right?
[10:02:19] <jzaefferer> so module() will still work as a function call?
[10:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit.module
[10:02:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yep
[10:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> Qunit.equal
[10:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> etc.
[10:02:33] <jzaefferer> globals are optional
[10:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> So it's all a non-issue in the first place.
[10:02:36] <rwaldron> its a pain for implementors, but it's there for just this reason
[10:02:40] <rwaldron> yes
[10:02:51] <jzaefferer> by now QUnit.test(name, function(assert) { assert.equal(…); }) also works
[10:02:56] <jzaefferer> or rather, will be in 1.7.0
[10:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> so ok, so close that ticket
[10:03:47] <rwaldron> jzaefferer neither module.exports nor QUnit.module nor module (an Identifier) will be a problem
[10:04:15] <rwaldron> because ES module requres "module Something {"
[10:04:38] <jzaefferer> Closed
[10:04:39] <rwaldron> otherwise implementors would've said "fuck no"
[10:04:40] <rwaldron> hahaha
[10:05:08] <rwaldron> canary's impl is behind
[10:05:15] <jzaefferer> Let's skip https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/186 - once johnbender extracted the grunt-qunit-xml plugin, we can revisit that
[10:05:16] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #186 on qunit (jzaefferer; 5m, 1w ago): Provide a JUnit reporter
[10:05:23] <rwaldron> which is why turning on experimental js will break google maps, docs etc.

[10:09:08] <jzaefferer> 2: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/173
[10:09:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #173 on qunit (jzaefferer; 6m, 3w ago): Sandboxing and parallelization
[10:09:28] <jzaefferer> johnbender rwaldron: this one is for you
[10:09:59] <jzaefferer> What johnbender describes is basically the composite addon for a single suite, isn't it?
[10:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like his description is a bit crazier.
[10:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> Stopping and resuming tests within a frame.
[10:12:01] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah the idea is to run _each_ test
[10:12:13] <johnbender> and have it set up as a switch
[10:12:18] <johnbender> so you can run your tests as normal
[10:12:24] <johnbender> or have a complete state reset
[10:12:27] <johnbender> via an iframe
[10:12:44] <johnbender> no progress on that though :(
[10:13:19] <johnbender> also that _will_ cause issues when run with test swarm I imagine which has dampened my enthusiasm
[10:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> Sandboxing each test might add a fair amount of overhead.
[10:13:40] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: in terms of time?
[10:13:43] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: absolutely
[10:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:13:53] <jzaefferer> Sooo
[10:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be more interested in parallelizing modules or something.
[10:14:03] <jzaefferer> You mentioned you wrote something for jQuery Mobile
[10:14:08] <jzaefferer> is that actually in use?
[10:14:10] <johnbender> nope
[10:14:16] <johnbender> I got about 60% of the way there
[10:14:31] <jzaefferer> Is that enough of an issue to justify the work and runtime overhead?
[10:14:41] <johnbender> well
[10:14:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: parallelizing to get results faster?
[10:14:59] <johnbender> our suite has stabilized a lot over time so it's less of an issue now, but broadly I think it's a problem with javascript tests
[10:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:15:36] <johnbender> the runtime overhead could be offset by running many tests in many iframes but that requires testing
[10:15:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: wouldn't that only make sense when you actually have multiple threads?
[10:15:46] <johnbender> also it might be something you'd push to the ci server
[10:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> Async code.
[10:15:55] <johnbender> ^
[10:15:58] <jzaefferer> only case I can think of where parallel execution would be faster is when you deal with a lot of timeouts
[10:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> I bet UI and Mobile would benefit quite a bit.
[10:16:03] <johnbender> ^
[10:16:08] <johnbender> yes
[10:16:37] <johnbender> the biggest issue I ran into when I was working on it was extracting an individual test run out of the stack that qunit keeps
[10:16:40] <jzaefferer> How about closing this one, and creating a fresh one just for parallel execution?
[10:16:44] <johnbender> and then shuttling that into the iframe
[10:16:58] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I actually care more about it for the state reset
[10:17:00] <jzaefferer> johnbender: sounds like you should just use the filter feature
[10:17:01] <johnbender> but that's up to you guys
[10:17:17] <johnbender> jzaefferer: hm, that's a fine idea
[10:17:23] <jzaefferer> johnbender: right, but one makes it run faster, the other slower and "safer"
[10:17:28] <johnbender> yes!
[10:17:33] <johnbender> so two seperate issues?
[10:17:36] <jzaefferer> yeah
[10:17:36] <johnbender> *separate
[10:17:41] * johnbender can't spell that damn word
[10:17:45] <jzaefferer> haha
[10:17:50] <jzaefferer> been there...
[10:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> I think the correct spelling is "sep." :-P
[10:18:01] <johnbender> :D
[10:18:05] <jzaefferer> in german its a lot more obvious
[10:18:12] <jzaefferer> same word, different pronounciation
[10:18:23] <jzaefferer> well, without the e at the end
[10:18:31] <jzaefferer> no need for that anyway...
[10:18:37] <jzaefferer> soooo
[10:18:47] <johnbender> I'll split it up
[10:18:56] <johnbender> assuming I have permissions
[10:19:03] <johnbender> ahh
[10:19:07] <johnbender> I can just close and open new ones

[10:23:03] <jzaefferer> http://bitovi.com/blog/2010/07/syn-a-standalone-synthetic-event-library.html
[10:23:12] <jzaefferer> Download http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/funcunit/dist/scripts/syn.js (59KB. Size doesn’t matter. Users don’t download this)
[10:23:12] <jzaefferer> haha
[10:23:17] <jzaefferer> right on
[10:24:17] <jzaefferer> That looks somewhat like simulate.js, but goes a few steps further
[10:24:25] <jzaefferer> Syn.type('JavaScriptMVC[shift][left][left][left][shift-up]\b',
[10:24:25] <jzaefferer>  'foo')
[10:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh, it 404s
[10:24:53] <jzaefferer> nice
[10:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jupiterjs/syn
[10:25:20] <jzaefferer> what's up with bitovi vs jupiterjs?
[10:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[10:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like Syn.js works the way simulate does.
[10:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> So not worth digging into.
[10:27:46] <scott_gonzalez> JSRobot might be worth looking into.
[10:27:49] <scott_gonzalez> It uses java.
[10:27:51] <jzaefferer> Someone mentioned https://github.com/ephox/JSRobot/
[10:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> Someone = Wes
[10:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> I actually saw him over the weekend. He was back in the states for a few days.
[10:28:47] <jzaefferer> right
[10:28:50] <jzaefferer> ah, okay?
[10:28:54] <jzaefferer> Where was he?
[10:28:57] <jzaefferer> Or is he now
[10:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> He lives in Australia now, working for Atlassian.
[10:29:14] <jzaefferer> Riding a roo to work?
[10:29:27] <scott_gonzalez> heh, rides his bike to work
[10:29:37] <jzaefferer> That also works
[10:30:03] <jzaefferer> So I tend to just documenting the options and closing the ticket.
[10:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[10:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit itself does nothing related to the DOM, other than resetting the fixture.
[10:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> So this is easily out of scope.
[10:31:38] <jzaefferer> Yeah
[10:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything?
[10:32:20] <jzaefferer> Alright, down to 12 tickets, I'll tackle a bunch of those over the next days, Scott got one, maybe one from Yehuda
[10:32:32] <jzaefferer> And some others will just continue to sit around and wait for better ideas
[10:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:32:44] <jzaefferer> Yep, that's all, thanks
[10:32:55] <jzaefferer> Till next time, August or something ;)
[10:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> 30% reduction in tickets.
[10:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> Let's do that to UI :-P
[10:59:54] <Wilto> All wings: report in.
[11:00:10] <uGoMobi> present
[11:01:41] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:01:46] <toddparker> the jQuery Mobile meeting is now starting
[11:01:54] <toddparker> Agenda here:
[11:01:55] <toddparker> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i3cHUre22BreB3BwkTu5EjFImYL0-zup4WS7gUS9w7I/edit
[11:02:19] <toddparker> so who's here?
[11:02:39] <uGoMobi> Jasper de Groot is here
[11:02:45] <toddparker> I see Wilto, uGoMobi, _|Nix|_
[11:02:47] <gseguin> Ghislain
[11:02:55] <toddparker> johnbender?
[11:03:05] <toddparker> any UI guys here?
[11:03:11] <toddparker> anne?
[11:03:48] <johnbender> here!
[11:04:04] <toddparker> hey-o
[11:04:13] <scottjehl> hey
[11:04:26] <toddparker> ok, let's all do a quick rundown of status and try to keep this to 10-15 minutes
[11:04:31] <toddparker> I'll go first
[11:04:38] <scottjehl> k
[11:05:02] <toddparker> I just posted a public spreadsheet of all devices in out current test lab here:
[11:05:09] <toddparker> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Agm-zX35StMidE1uaWRNSmVmaWFVWkdPWnc2dmxHeVE#gid=0
[11:05:29] <toddparker> And installed Adobe Shaow on the iOS and Android devices to help us do batch tests faster
[11:05:46] <johnbender> yay
[11:05:52] <toddparker> Q: should we have each team member capture their devices here
[11:06:01] <toddparker> so we know who can test what?
[11:06:16] <scottjehl> sounds like a nice idea
[11:06:21] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:06:22] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:06:27] <scottjehl> Todd I have one or two to add to the list still
[11:06:30] <johnbender> yah
[11:06:40] <toddparker> I just need to make you all editors or make this editable publicly (yikes)
[11:06:46] <johnbender> should we have the person who's in possession in there?
[11:06:52] <johnbender> owner sounds like who it belongs too
[11:06:54] <johnbender> *to
[11:06:56] <toddparker> we could, yes
[11:07:04] <scottjehl> good idea
[11:07:15] <toddparker> ok, let's follow up after on logistcs
[11:07:35] <toddparker> related: Todd & Anne to work on device donation page
[11:07:38] <gseguin> We have a bunch here at Jive too
[11:07:46] <toddparker> Anne has a draft, I'll work on doing another pass
[11:07:52] <toddparker> gseguin: cool
[11:08:14] <toddparker> I'd like to really push on getting more devices so we can distribute these to team members
[11:08:20] <toddparker> so donations matter
[11:08:52] <toddparker> so other than that, we've made good progress on bug triage and fixes
[11:09:12] <toddparker> down from close to 600 a few weeks ago to 440
[11:09:32] <toddparker> great work everyone
[11:09:45] <Wilto> \o/
[11:09:51] <johnbender> incredible
[11:09:55] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:10:07] <toddparker> i bet we can get into the 300's within a week if we keep cranking
[11:10:34] <toddparker> uGoMobi has been tagging them o we can track big issue topics
[11:10:39] <toddparker> ok, i'll zip it
[11:10:52] <gseguin> I'll go
[11:10:55] <toddparker> who wants to go next? what have you been up to this week
[11:11:10] <gseguin> css builder now outputs structure + them
[11:11:11] <gseguin> e
[11:11:25] <gseguin> working on decoupling basic comps
[11:11:42] <gseguin> like touch, orientation, throttledresize
[11:11:57] <gseguin> so people can use them as "standalone"
[11:12:15] <scottjehl> nice
[11:12:16] <toddparker> great
[11:12:21] <gseguin> got a license of WebStorm 4.0 from JetBrains for the jQM team
[11:12:30] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez will be a big help there
[11:12:37] <gseguin> sent out an email. let me know if I missed you
[11:12:42] <johnbender> gseguin: can't wait for that
[11:12:42] <gseguin> that's it
[11:12:43] <toddparker> saw that thanks. anyone want to use that?
[11:12:45] <toddparker> cool
[11:12:59] <toddparker> great
[11:13:14] <toddparker> agcolom: did you already update the meta data to support the download builder?
[11:14:05] <agcolom> gseguin did i think
[11:14:20] <toddparker> awesome, that was fast
[11:14:20] <gseguin> I did
[11:14:35] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[11:14:41] <toddparker> master of copy paste
[11:14:55] <toddparker> ok…jojohnbender
[11:14:58] <toddparker> heh
[11:15:03] <toddparker> johnbender - go for it
[11:15:13] <johnbender> my presentation
[11:15:15] <johnbender> solamente
[11:15:29] <toddparker> ok
[11:15:37] <toddparker> but you did some grunt stuff this week, no?
[11:15:41] <johnbender> toddparker: nope
[11:15:44] <johnbender> that was last week
[11:15:46] <toddparker> oh
[11:15:48] <toddparker> ok
[11:15:50] <toddparker> next!
[11:15:53] <scottjehl> ok
[11:15:55] <Wilto> We done already Grunted.
[11:16:01] <toddparker> eww
[11:16:36] <toddparker> _|Nix|_?
[11:16:43] <_|Nix|_> 1. Fixed #4423 ( initial page has dialogHashKey ) need to talk about it. 2. Merged custom-select-via-popup Need to talk about progressive enhancement. 3. Fixed popup screen sizing issues. 4. #4340 ( slow lists ) need to talk with gseguin.
[11:17:00] <_|Nix|_> That's about it.
[11:17:09] <_|Nix|_> ... that I can remember ...
[11:17:12] <scottjehl> yeah busy on client work this week but this morning I tested and reviewed the slow lists issue
[11:17:15] <scottjehl> offered a solution
[11:17:44] <toddparker> saw that - i'd like to nail that down
[11:17:48] <toddparker> is kinblas here?
[11:18:03] <scottjehl> Kin suggested a better way. I suggested maybe landing this first
[11:18:10] <toddparker> #4340 - do we need to blur() all links anymore now that gseguin has added the link tracking?
[11:18:11] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1267
[11:18:12] <toddparker> I’ve tried with that line commented out and the problem from #1840 (which caused the above line to be added) did not re-occur - Improvemen
[11:18:15] <scottjehl> his would involve changes to other parts I think
[11:18:40] <toddparker> scottjehl: you suggestion is to tighten down the scope
[11:18:47] <gseguin> I did what?
[11:19:10] <toddparker> scottjehl: mind summarizing
[11:19:14] <scottjehl> yeah it wouldn't be the fastest selector I've seen before but it'd limit the event triggers
[11:19:46] <scottjehl> so the gist of it is, our code is finding all link/buttons on the page that aren't the active link and triggering a blur event on them
[11:20:08] <scottjehl> really we just need to find the ones that have previously been focused/hovered/etc and trigger it on that
[11:20:25] <scottjehl> the issue thread has a suggested selector that could replace that line
[11:20:31] <kinblas> scottjehl: I can't attend the meeting today, but I can profile that change if you need me to, but later tonight for comparison.
[11:20:34] <scottjehl> and could be improved upon
[11:21:04] <scottjehl> sure. whatever you want to test would be great
[11:21:25] <toddparker> this is the biggest perf regression in 1.1 so I'd like to get some eyes on it
[11:21:28] <scottjehl> I was hoping someone in the thread could try that code out and report back.
[11:21:35] <scottjehl> this isn't a regression
[11:21:40] <toddparker> kin - if you have time to give this a look today, that would be awesome
[11:21:49] <scottjehl> that code landed almost a year ago, afaik
[11:21:58] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah it did
[11:22:08] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, it would have to be later tonight
[11:22:22] <toddparker> that's fine
[11:22:37] <toddparker> seems like you could probably make a call on this
[11:22:50] <scottjehl> sounds great
[11:22:58] <toddparker> i.e. - either tighten the scope or make bigger changes
[11:23:22] <toddparker> ok
[11:23:24] <scottjehl> A then B would be good I think
[11:23:36] <toddparker> yeah
[11:23:38] <toddparker> uGoMobi: what's new?
[11:23:51] <uGoMobi> beginning of the week mostly triage
[11:24:02] <toddparker> saw that - tons of issues
[11:24:04] <uGoMobi> now working on finishing PR buttons and form
[11:24:12] <toddparker> the width issue?
[11:24:20] <uGoMobi> among others
[11:24:46] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:24:47] <uGoMobi> will fix 10+ issues 1.1.1
[11:24:57] <Wilto> Sweet.
[11:25:01] <uGoMobi> need you to test on WP, Todd
[11:25:07] <toddparker> scottjehl: what was that article from paulirish re: using the new box model
[11:25:12] <uGoMobi> posted simple test page link in agenda
[11:25:19] <toddparker> oh, cool
[11:25:25] <uGoMobi> yeah i know that post of Paul
[11:25:26] <Wilto> toddparker: http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/ ?
[11:25:30] <toddparker> we now have interns here at FG who can do test runs for anyone
[11:25:31] <scottjehl> yeah that one
[11:25:50] <uGoMobi> only issue is IE7/WP
[11:25:55] <toddparker> we just need a list of devices, short link, steps to reproduce, and list of things to test for
[11:26:00] <uGoMobi> but not sure if WP is issue
[11:26:05] <gnarf> toddparker: sorry, had a call - here now :)
[11:26:15] <toddparker> yeah, that link. uGoMobi - not sure if you're using this approach, but it's a nice idea
[11:26:27] <Wilto> Also, the interns can do coffee runs for anyone.
[11:26:36] <Wilto> Really long coffee runs, depending on where one is located.
[11:26:39] <scottjehl> can they run it up to NH plz
[11:26:44] <Wilto> scottjehl: Y
[11:26:52] <uGoMobi> but the 100% width is just small part of it
[11:26:56] <uGoMobi> one other question
[11:27:06] <toddparker> sure, i know
[11:27:14] <uGoMobi> do we want forms in toolbars to default to mini?
[11:27:42] <scottjehl> you had a pr for that right?
[11:27:51] <toddparker> yes we do
[11:27:52] <scottjehl> I think it was ready to land
[11:27:57] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:28:23] <uGoMobi> that PR included CSS for mini listview
[11:28:27] <toddparker> yeah, thought it was in a PR from uGoMobi but was going to be broken out from other items?
[11:28:29] <uGoMobi> if you are talking about that one
[11:28:35] <toddparker> yeah, that
[11:28:54] <uGoMobi> and we decided not to support that
[11:29:06] <toddparker> right we're not supporting mini lists
[11:29:12] <uGoMobi> so I closed it and making new one  that includes the form styling
[11:29:28] <toddparker> but i think we should make all buttons and forms mini in toolbars, right?
[11:29:36] <toddparker> ok
[11:29:44] <uGoMobi> thats it
[11:29:55] <uGoMobi> after that want to look into updatePagePadding
[11:30:01] <toddparker> i'd have the consistency in a different commit from the mini rules
[11:30:05] <toddparker> yes please
[11:30:12] <toddparker> that has a bunch of issues
[11:30:34] <toddparker> I will test - Test box-sizing border-box on WP: jsbin.com/emaziy/ (Todd)
[11:30:44] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[11:30:58] <toddparker> is there an issue I can post results to?
[11:31:00] <uGoMobi> what do you mean with ẗhe mini rules ?
[11:31:17] <toddparker> just automatically making buttons mini
[11:31:18] <uGoMobi> yes its in agenda i think
[11:31:27] <toddparker> ok
[11:31:49] <toddparker> ok, i see it now
[11:32:01] <uGoMobi> i will break the PR in multiple commits, also because some might not land in 1.1.1
[11:32:06] <toddparker> right
[11:32:09] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:32:18] <toddparker> agcolom: what have you been up to?
[11:32:33] <agcolom> Hi
[11:32:51] <agcolom> Will meet Richard about the new docs
[11:32:54] <agcolom> next week
[11:33:35] <agcolom> Otherwise some docs issues (PRs pulled in)
[11:33:46] <toddparker> all: XML format that follows the UI standard for docs in the works
[11:33:50] <toddparker> cool
[11:33:59] <toddparker> and the device donation page
[11:34:03] <toddparker> ok
[11:34:04] <agcolom> there are some more there that need someone to check whether the changes are correct
[11:34:13] <agcolom> yes, the device donation page.
[11:34:19] <toddparker> ok, maybe hit us up on IRC later for that
[11:34:25] <agcolom> (draft) needs data :-)
[11:34:30] <toddparker> yes
[11:34:31] <agcolom> and some more articles on the resources page
[11:34:33] <toddparker> my job
[11:34:35] <toddparker> JasonDScott?
[11:34:44] <toddparker> know this issue
[11:34:45] <toddparker> BlackBerry 7.1 Transitions https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4001 documentation about -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
[11:34:46] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4001 on jquery-mobile (jasondscott; 1m, 2w ago): Page flashes after transition is complete on BlackBerry 7.1
[11:35:01] <JasonDScott> Yes I have been working on that
[11:35:22] <JasonDScott> The fix I have works well on BB but is flashing on iOS
[11:35:23] <toddparker> my comment was that using back face-visibility is sort of scary, memory-wise so we avoid ever adding this globally
[11:35:32] <toddparker> (just so people understand)
[11:35:37] <toddparker> hmmm
[11:35:45] <toddparker> ok, well keep plugging away
[11:35:59] <JasonDScott> I think agcolom is going to document the work around for now
[11:35:59] <toddparker> any way the BB browser could get a tweak to avoid this issue?
[11:36:03] <toddparker> ok
[11:36:14] <JasonDScott> I will keep going at it, it really bothers me
[11:36:29] <toddparker> if someone like Eli could nail down what is causing it in your renderer, might be fixable
[11:36:32] <toddparker> agreed
[11:36:43] <toddparker> seems like a regression
[11:36:49] <toddparker> 6 doesn't have this issue, right?
[11:36:54] <toddparker> or playbook
[11:37:02] <JasonDScott> Not that I am aware of
[11:37:09] <toddparker> that's the odd thing
[11:37:20] <JasonDScott> I agree it does seem like a regression
[11:37:20] <toddparker> any way to run this up the chain of command?
[11:37:24] <toddparker> yeah
[11:37:28] <agcolom> And also did a fair amount of testing for _|Nix|_ and JasonDScott. I enjoy that a lot :-)
[11:37:44] <_|Nix|_> Thanks!
[11:38:08] <toddparker> thanks agcolom
[11:38:33] <toddparker> anyone else want to chime in with updates (sorry if I forgot to ask someone)
[11:38:41] <JasonDScott> I have talked to Eli briefly, he said that we need to get/trick the webkit engine to turn on 3d support
[11:38:58] <toddparker> thus backface
[11:39:15] <JasonDScott> It is hard to run 7.1 issues up the chain, everyone is focuses on BB10
[11:39:43] <toddparker> i know
[11:39:52] <toddparker>  don't see an issue on that device, do you?
[11:40:04] <JasonDScott> BB10? no
[11:40:09] <toddparker> me either
[11:40:13] <toddparker> just a blip
[11:40:22] <JasonDScott> Exactly
[11:40:29] <toddparker> alright, if no other team member have updates
[11:40:40] <toddparker> anyone from the community have questions?
[11:41:06] <toddparker> (i'll give this a minute, then we can wrap up)
[11:42:30] <toddparker> alright all
[11:42:35] <toddparker> wrapping up
[11:42:39] <toddparker> thanks everyone
[11:42:58] <toddparker> meeting is over, giddy up
[11:43:06] <agcolom> just to let you know I'll be away from tomorrow until monday eveonday
[11:43:15] <toddparker> ok agcolom
[11:43:16] <agcolom> evening
