[11:04:46] <toddparker> Wilto doesn't know how CSS works
[11:04:53] <toddparker> version flag is now CSS based
[11:04:56] <Wilto> #realtalk
[11:06:05] <toddparker> dialog will be landing in master soon
[11:06:09] <toddparker> branch: popup-widget
[11:06:46] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[11:07:01] <toddparker> currently, every popup has handers for hash and page change
[11:07:21] <toddparker> in #3653 - added popupStack to manage handlers
[11:07:43] <toddparker> #4097 bug needs a look too
[11:08:05] <toddparker> popupStack is pretty much ready to go, needs unit test
[11:18:14] <toddparker> need to think about the nav model - support back button w/o changepage
[11:18:19] <toddparker> multiple steps?
[11:30:27] <toddparker> after discussing, we're going to create a new branch that only supports a single popup at a time to avoid all the complexity of multiple, nested popups and the popupStack
[11:33:00] <toddparker> next
[11:33:12] <toddparker> download builder - alpha is now ready for testing!!
