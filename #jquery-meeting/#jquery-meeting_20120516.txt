[09:00:36] <scott_gonzalez> Hey everyone!
[09:01:05] <rworth> hey
[09:02:45] <danheberden> squirrel!
[09:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: I assume there's no infra update?
[09:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> We're not waiting on anything.
[09:03:45] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i'm uncertain, i've been aloof with work 'n stuff, so gnarf has been shouldering the load of that
[09:04:14] <danheberden> i'm hoping to remain available for him in the coming days to find out where we are
[09:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Any update on documentation progress?
[09:05:22] <rworth> not since last week, nope
[09:05:26] <gelegrodan> hi
[09:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> Tooltip and autocomplete accessibility changes are complete!
[09:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks to jzaefferer and Hans.
[09:06:06] <rworth> yay jzaefferer
[09:06:11] <rworth> (and Hans, yes)
[09:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> While implementing autocomplete changes, we started talking about i18n again.
[09:06:48] <gelegrodan> quick question, are the  accessibility parts going to be optional?
[09:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to look into using CLDR for Globalize and I think it will provide some of the missing data for datepicker as well.
[09:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan: No, why?
[09:07:13] <gelegrodan> shrug, save bytes i guess
[09:07:30] <scott_gonzalez> Accessibility is not something you should ditch to save a few bytes.
[09:08:05] <gelegrodan> some might want that
[09:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad.
[09:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> Some people like to do lots of bad things.
[09:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> We have no desire to support them.
[09:08:58] <gelegrodan> ok, just a question..
[09:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'd also like to look into using ICU MessageFormat when we tackle i18n.
[09:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> Alex Sexton has a good article about it: http://alexsexton.com/blog/2012/03/the-ux-of-language/
[09:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> But we can't get that done in time for 1.9.
[09:09:48] <rworth> scott_gonzalez one consideration in using CLDR is we have data not only from .Net but we also do some custom work for some different calendars
[09:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: We should get that back into CLDR if it's wrong.
[09:10:23] <rworth> presumably this could be ported, but this is some C# code that's fun to navigate as it requires understanding lots of different kinds of calendars
[09:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> We can also have a script that fixes mistakes when we refresh the data.
[09:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> I landed the new animation API for tabs as well.
[09:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> Using the new show and hide options.
[09:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> So that matches tooltip and (sort of) dialog.
[09:14:01] <rworth> awesome
[09:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog still has the original implementation that the new code is based on.
[09:14:12] <rworth> will it get updated?
[09:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> So it's 90% the same, but will get updated to use the new code in 1.10.
[09:14:20] <rworth> not in 1.9
[09:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> Correct, dialog redesign is slated for 1.10.
[09:14:39] <rworth> ok
[09:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> Hooray for .tabs({ hide: "explode" }) :-P
[09:16:07] <rworth> hooray for explode ;)
[09:16:23] <rworth> actually, I take that back
[09:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a few releases coming up too.
[09:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9m8 is planned for this week.
[09:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> The two big things for m8 will be autocomplete a11y and position feedback.
[09:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.21 will be closer to the end of the month.
[09:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> Then hope is that we can get 1.8.22 and 1.9 out for the end of June.
[09:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 is looking a bit tight still, with lots of review to do on menu.
[09:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> But we're definitely getting close.
[09:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a lot of stuff done from the roadmap: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[09:18:49] <rworth> yeah, that's looking really good
[09:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:23:21] <gelegrodan> maybe someone can help gnarf so this lands; https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/185
[09:23:22] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by lindstroem (1y, 4w ago): Split
[09:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's not landing in 1.9.
[09:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> There's plenty of other effects stuff that has to happen first.
[09:24:14] <gelegrodan> ok, then it should be removed from the roadmap?
[09:24:29] <gelegrodan> or moved to 1.10 or wherever it fits
[09:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll move the whole effects block to 1.10.
[09:25:57] <gelegrodan> how is the documentation going? scott said the wiki page was outdated
[09:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ^
[09:26:11] <gelegrodan> most scripts seems to be in place?
[09:26:37] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged rworth about updating that page, but he hasn't gotten to it yet (I think he was doing a training).
[09:26:43] <rworth> yes, the wiki page needs to be updated
[09:26:53] <rworth> I'll be doing that today before I leave town for a few days
[09:27:01] <gelegrodan> great
[09:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan: Are you interested in helping with the actual docs or just the infrastructure about the docs?
[09:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> s/about/around/
[09:27:41] <gelegrodan> hm, im interested in helping in general
[09:28:09] <gelegrodan> so if rworth needs help, sure
[09:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> There's plenty of work to be done for docs :-)
[09:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> We'd love your help.
[09:28:32] <rworth> indeed
[09:28:37] <gelegrodan> yes i figured so, problem is you really dont know what to do
[09:28:47] <gelegrodan> since many of the "todos" seems to be done already
[09:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Let's switch the topic of our call from site redesigns to cleaning up that page so we can get gelegrodan involved.
[09:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's essentially on-topic anyway :-)
[09:31:07] <rworth> sounds great
[09:31:16] <rworth> ok, back in a few and see you then scott_gonzalez
[09:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. I'm going to mute this channel.
[09:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan: We'll ping you in #jqueryui-dev after rworth and I talk and get that page cleaned up.
[09:32:34] <gelegrodan> ok, sounds great
