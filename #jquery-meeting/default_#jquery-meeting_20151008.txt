[12:03:05] <arschmitz> `pepteam
[12:03:17] <arschmitz> stupid bot lol
[12:03:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: isnt here
[12:03:47] <arschmitz> looks like no jrossie incarnations either
[12:03:58] <arschmitz> or snover
[12:05:03] <jdalton> hi
[12:06:40] <arschmitz> jdalton: anything to talk about no one really here lol
[12:07:00] <jdalton> I threw up a PR just now
[12:07:02] <jdalton> with more tests
[12:07:09] <jdalton> Imma do a pass this morning and make them more explicit
[12:07:17] <jdalton> since it doesn't hurt
[12:07:25] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[12:12:18] <jdalton> that's all my take
[12:15:20] <arschmitz> i looked at  https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/219
[12:15:23] <arschmitz> briefly
[12:15:43] <arschmitz> and i think this is an issue with older iOS / not handling touch cancel at some point in the past
[12:17:00] <arschmitz> that tends to be where this happens since  in older iOS you could lose events because anything that "happened" during scrolling was thrown away rather then queued
[12:17:17] <arschmitz> thats all i got
[12:27:16] <arschmitz> ok well i guess ill call it a day then
[14:01:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: sfrisk: jasperdegroot: gabrielschulhof: apsdehal: meeting time

[14:03:01] <arschmitz> so big news this week

[14:03:10] <arschmitz> im am currently landing button on master in UI
[14:03:17] <sfrisk> huzzuh!
[14:03:20] <arschmitz> so we will no longer have to work on a branch of a fork
[14:03:21] <jasperdegroot> nice
[14:04:34] <gabrielschulhof> :+1:
[14:05:15] <arschmitz> update from cgack he did some more updates to navbar and i will be review that
[14:05:51] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: any update on selectmenu
[14:05:51] <arschmitz> ?
[14:06:13] <gabrielschulhof> Unfortunately, no. I haven't had time this week.
[14:06:17] <arschmitz> ok
[14:06:23] <gabrielschulhof> I'll try to squeeze something in on the weekend.
[14:06:26] <arschmitz> ok
[14:08:46] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: any additional progress on demos"?
[14:09:07] <jasperdegroot> small progress, not really worth a PR yet
[14:09:16] <arschmitz> ok
[14:09:21] <jasperdegroot> it would help if https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8197 got merged
[14:09:38] <arschmitz> ok ill make sure that gets merged ASAP
[14:09:40] <jasperdegroot> then I could update the menu markup and our custom css
[14:09:59] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:10:18] <arschmitz> the only other thing i have today is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BAJM7nDkqiCTmYxaqThQj3LNghzPqrX2YQdvbGdxpMA/edit
[14:10:31] <arschmitz> starting to create a list of things for people to work on at the summit
[14:10:43] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: are you going to be at the summit?
[14:10:47] <jasperdegroot> yes
[14:11:01] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i assume you will also be?
[14:11:11] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: can you make that doc public or should we ask permission
[14:11:25] <arschmitz> oh scott made that doc
[14:11:32] <sfrisk> I don't have access
[14:11:45] <arschmitz> ill make a new one
[14:11:48] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:11:50] <sfrisk> Okay
[14:12:26] <gabrielschulhof> I'll be there.
[14:12:27] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tq3RP0NgD-3oz--YcJ_KqWLqlOCeVLyPRHBNDgsrb_M/edit?usp=sharing
[14:13:27] <jasperdegroot> looks good
[14:13:30] <arschmitz> i may have to bounce around a bit to different teams especially chassis since it will be only sfrisk and she wont be there for planning friday. So i would like to have a good list / plan worked out in advance
[14:13:42] <sfrisk> Themes maybe?
[14:13:43] <arschmitz> and add any issue links we have to those items
[14:14:02] <arschmitz> sfrisk: how can they make themes with nothing to theme?
[14:14:21] <arschmitz> sfrisk: lets try to use next weeks chassis meeting to plan the chassis part
[14:14:33] <sfrisk> Wasn't sure if we wanted any additional 1.5 themes
[14:14:41] <sfrisk> Sounds good, I think Chassis is moving the meeting time back an hour
[14:14:48] <sfrisk> since 1 stopped working for anyone
[14:14:55] <sfrisk> everyone*
[14:14:58] <arschmitz> oh we dont do themes in that way
[14:15:13] <jasperdegroot> I think we should stick to one theme until we switch to using Chassis for Mobile
[14:15:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:15:19] <sfrisk> Works for me
[14:15:38] <arschmitz> yeah for mobile we should focus on things that get us closer to 1.5
[14:15:43] <sfrisk> I was planning on using the summit as time to get a bunch of Chassis work done.  Also Chassis is having a hackathon the following weekend
[14:15:48] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you were working on upgrade guide, right?
[14:15:57] <arschmitz> yeah its basicly done
[14:16:22] <arschmitz> aside from things we have not finished yet like navbar and table and stuff
[14:16:54] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:18:01] <arschmitz> ok thats all i have
[14:18:14] <arschmitz> anyone can feel free to edit that doc add things add links etc
[14:18:43] <arschmitz> im assuming most people wont be able to make next weeks meeting since its the summiit travel day for most
[14:18:53] <jasperdegroot> I added iOS label to iOS9 tickets
[14:19:04] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: execlent thank you
[14:19:06] <jasperdegroot> all recent iOS labelled tickets are iOS9 issues
[14:19:15] <arschmitz> we can also se the help wanted label to help at summit
[14:19:22] <jasperdegroot> ah right
[14:20:18] <jasperdegroot> should we create tickets in the API docs repo for all widgets of which we need to update the docs?
[14:20:25] <arschmitz> yes
[14:22:08] <jasperdegroot> we have some time on Friday together during team meeting to prepare this, right?
[14:22:57] <arschmitz> yes
[14:23:25] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:23:52] <sfrisk> Okay, I have to go to a meeting, do you need anything else from me?
[14:24:04] <arschmitz> no thats all i have
[14:24:09] <sfrisk> Okay
[14:24:39] <jasperdegroot> ok see you all next week
[14:24:50] <gabrielschulhof> L8R
