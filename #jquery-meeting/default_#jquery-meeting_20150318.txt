[09:00:42] * rxaviers on standby
[09:00:42] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:01:02] <tj_vantoll> hey
[09:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> First on the agenda... CLASSES LANDED IN MASTER!
[09:02:31] <arschmitz> YAY!
[09:03:02] <jzaefferer> not on the agenda: Lots of style issues are fixed
[09:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz is working on cleaning up the buttons branch now to send a new PR against master.
[09:03:20] <arschmitz> yup essentially done that
[09:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> I just pushed a new branch for AMDifying tests.
[09:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1511
[09:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> Based on a discussion with jzaefferer
[09:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's just rxaviers' existing changes but with reduced scope.
[09:06:03] <jzaefferer> all the changes from the classes PR made it difficult to update the AMDify-tests branch
[09:06:23] <jzaefferer> focusing on one widget without breaking all other tests allows us a step-by-step migration
[09:06:54] <jzaefferer> We need to figure out how to deal with $.ui.backCompat in the AMD context, since requirejs specifies no ordering
[09:07:35] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: any input on that?
[09:08:35] <rxaviers> no input
[09:08:39] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the simple solution is done include core in those defines add that as a script tag to each page still place backcompat after
[09:08:46] <arschmitz> done/don't
[09:10:02] <jzaefferer> that sounds terrible
[09:10:08] <jzaefferer> why even bother with AMD?
[09:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> The fix is to have a backcompat module that requires jquery and sets the flag, then returns jquery.
[09:10:44] <jzaefferer> that sounds better
[09:10:47] <arschmitz> that seems sane
[09:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> I can work on this after I finish the PEP release script.
[09:12:43] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: is removing `classes: {}` the only left over from the PR?
[09:12:55] <jzaefferer> I think I can deal with that and work on the API docs
[09:13:14] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah and if we want to use strict class checks anywhere
[09:13:17] <jzaefferer> gives you more time for button and everything else on Mobile
[09:13:24] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: do we?
[09:13:29] <arschmitz> we can update qunit-assert-classes
[09:13:40] <arschmitz> there were some places it makes sense
[09:13:42] <jzaefferer> I mean, are there areas where we should?
[09:13:51] <jzaefferer> so, which places?
[09:14:02] <arschmitz> there are 2 that come to mind
[09:14:14] <jzaefferer> sounds like you should just do that yourself, will likely be quicker
[09:14:17] <arschmitz> places where we do has and lacks on the same element at same time
[09:14:46] <arschmitz> and in $.widget tests where its a test widget
[09:14:58] <jzaefferer> or I'll look for those and do a PR and you can tell me what I missed
[09:15:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah im happy to do it ill open an issue so i dont forget
[09:15:10] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: either way
[09:15:32] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: go ahead then; I'm actually running out of hours for this month anyway :/
[09:16:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll arschmitz: any thoughts on dealing with Trac spam?
[09:16:58] <jzaefferer> I once asked on Twitter for help, got no response
[09:17:23] <jzaefferer> playing catchup by adding to the blacklist makes no sense, we'll never get rid of the problem that way
[09:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really want to move away from Trac. Maybe we can try reaching out to someone on the Trac team and see if they have a recommendation for a person that can help with the upgrade?
[09:17:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: im more or less indifferent there are things i like about trac but the spam is out of control. and every other project i work on uses github so im used to it lol
[09:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged the people working on the upgrade yesterday but haven't gotten a response.
[09:17:44] <tj_vantoll> ^ +1
[09:17:44] <jzaefferer> dunno why askismet lets so many spam tickets through
[09:18:08] <jzaefferer> reaching out to Trac team sounds like an option
[09:18:09] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: which comment was that a +1 to lol
[09:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Was the +1 for me or arschmitz?
[09:18:17] <jzaefferer> what are we gonna we if that doesn't go anywhere either?
[09:18:22] <tj_vantoll> For arschmitz
[09:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> Then we reach out to WordPress?
[09:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> They have a really nice Trac setup.
[09:18:53] <jzaefferer> Are they using Trac?
[09:19:12] <jzaefferer> Contact both directly
[09:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> I can do that.
[09:19:28] <jzaefferer> Alright
[09:19:39] <jzaefferer> that buys you some time :p
[09:20:08] <jzaefferer> Anything else?
[09:20:28] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: what's your availability like?
[09:20:52] <tj_vantoll> Low unfortunately
[09:21:33] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:22:07] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: so you'll work on removing `classes: {}` and updating qunit-assert-classes, I'll work on the API docs
[09:22:10] <arschmitz> if anyone wants to fix links http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Websites/job/stage.jqueryui.com/1/consoleFull
[09:22:21] <arschmitz> jqueryui.com could use a little love
[09:22:45] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yup
[09:23:33] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: wanna fix some bad redirects?
[09:23:45] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: theres like 15 404s too
[09:24:15] <arthurvr> Yeah sure but Iâ€™ve got not much time this week. Will defenitly work on some.
[09:24:36] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: alright, thanks
[09:24:42] <jzaefferer> I think thats it then
[09:25:29] <jzaefferer> thanks everyone
[09:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
