[09:00:43] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:45] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:00:49] <tj_vantoll> :waves:
[09:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> We've had quite a few PRs come in this week.
[09:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> A lot from team members.
[09:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> I've got some that are waiting for review: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/scottgonzalez
[09:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> And fnagel opened two in the past 24 hours: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/fnagel
[09:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel jzaefferer: What's the intention of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1520?
[09:02:37] <fnagel> Yeah wanted to show you something before I'm on vacation
[09:03:01] <fnagel> Jörn wanted to have a demo for showing usage of a default but diasabled option
[09:03:25] <fnagel> I assumed an extra demo fot that would be too much
[09:03:28] <fnagel> * fdor
[09:03:29] <rxaviers> hi
[09:03:30] <fnagel> * for
[09:03:52] <arthurvr> Hey guys!
[09:03:59] <mikesherov> hi
[09:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> Do people actually do this?
[09:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've seen a lot of people do the empty initial value.
[09:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like good product selection UX always starts on a valid option.
[09:05:37] <arschmitz> iv seen it not saying its good but iv seen it a bunch
[09:05:54] <fnagel> I did this for some UIs, when having a select which needs action but should not have a default value
[09:06:06] <tj_vantoll> I've done it on selects as well.
[09:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think product selection is a good example of that though.
[09:06:25] <fnagel> gender, salutation, etc.
[09:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> For example, I don't think you'll ever end up on an Amazon page with no product selected.
[09:06:39] <tj_vantoll> Salutation is a good one.
[09:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> It'd just be bad UX.
[09:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> So, the closest example I can think of with good UX on product selection would be:
[09:07:36] <scott_gonzalez> Default color, no default size, but a preview still exists.
[09:07:40] <fnagel> It was the best fit of our current demos in my opinion, perhaps we add another demo
[09:08:09] <fnagel> So we just add it for size and give it a default via CSS as before?
[09:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> Is the concern that people will think this isn't possible if we don't demo it?
[09:08:46] <fnagel> Something like that, but you will need to ask Jörn for his motiviation
[09:08:50] <arschmitz> yeah im unclear on why this is needed in a demo
[09:09:06] <fnagel> I think he wanted to show its possible
[09:09:07] <arschmitz> unless you need to do something out of the ordinary for the widget
[09:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> Since this is just standard <select> behavior, I don't see any reason to explicitly show it.
[09:12:59] <fnagel> Too bad jzaefferer isn't here to advocate his suggestion, perhaps we keep the PR open until Jörn commented, ok?
[09:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> sound good
[09:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What's the status of button?
[09:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> I saw tons of comments from jzaefferer, but I haven't been following along.
[09:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> Was waiting for that to die down so I can do a review on the next round of updates.
[09:15:22] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: finished reviewing earlier this week
[09:15:42] <arschmitz> but i have been busy with some other stuff and have not updated it based on his review yet
[09:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll wait until after jzaefferer reviews the next round of updates :-P
[09:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing that needs to be discussed here?
[09:19:07] <arschmitz> i ont think so
[09:19:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> I emailed someone from the Trac team last week.
[09:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> And we now have a few of the Trac team members working on upgrading our Trac install.
[09:20:12] <scott_gonzalez> They say with the updated spam plugin, spam is practically non-existant for them.
[09:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> So hopefully we'll have this resolved soon.
[09:21:16] <arthurvr> Sounds awesome
[09:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> I made a bunch of progress on AMD in tests: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1511
[09:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> It's quite a differnet implementation from the earlier approach.
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> The big problem right now is that QUnit doens't really work with AMD (I have a PR for that).
[09:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> And that grunt-contrib-qunit requires QUnit to be available immediately (bigger problem).
[09:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> So I may need to dig into that and see what's going on.
[09:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> Because right now this change would mean that we can't test in Grunt anymore.
[09:24:09] <arschmitz> yeah that would not be good
[09:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be good to get feedback on the approach that I used.
[09:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> And I can look into grunt-contrib-qunit.
[09:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> Can we close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1335?
[09:25:45] <tj_vantoll> Probably yeah
[09:26:26] <arschmitz> seems like it
[09:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers?
[09:27:41] <rxaviers> Unless you guys have any question for me, I'm good. I'm mostly on stand by
[09:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> Can we close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1335?
[09:29:08] <rxaviers> I'm assuming https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1511 has supersdeded it
[09:29:54] <rxaviers> I can review 1511 later. But, I think we're good to close it
[09:30:02] <rxaviers> close it = close 1335
[09:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you know if there's anything that neesd to be discussed for classes API docs?
[09:31:58] <arschmitz> I dont think so
[09:32:08] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it looks like addressed all my comments
[09:32:29] <arschmitz> i just need to review it again
[09:32:57] <arschmitz> oh one thing i had asked in it to you i dont think was answered thoguh
[09:33:25] <arschmitz> about would it be possible to get better display of a default value thats an object
[09:34:44] <arschmitz> right now it shows them as a big string which is super ugly
[09:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, that's pretty tricky.
[09:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> We can try.
[09:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> It has to be implemented in XSLT.
[09:35:21] <arschmitz> yeah i figured
[09:35:36] <arschmitz> we would want to do something like cored does in .data for html5 data attributes
[09:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I wonder if we can just make it nicer directly in the attribute.
[09:36:07] <arschmitz> where we attempt to figure out the type and format properly
[09:36:37] <arschmitz> how would we do that?
[09:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues/64
[09:36:59] <arschmitz> cool
[09:37:34] <arschmitz> it just makes some of the classes defaults look horrible if they are a large object like tabs
[09:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we've got this issue with tooltip about constantly appending new elements to the DOM for ARIA: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10689
[09:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> I had this suggestion in the ticket: Perhaps we can dynamically create and destroy the entire live region based on a timer after all tooltips are closed.
[09:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> Does that seem reasonable?
[09:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't think of anything else to do.
[09:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's safe to assume that if the tooltip is closed, that we don't have to worry about removing the content.
[09:44:16] <arschmitz> seems like a reasonable option
[09:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I can look into that.
[09:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> There was also a request for selectmenu to have a default max height: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11606
[09:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> This is something I've thought about before too.
[09:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, it's line 379 in my todo list :-P
[09:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> One of these days I'll get better about that...
[09:45:52] <arschmitz> so this is part of what we needed to figure out for mobile too
[09:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> What does mobile currently do?
[09:46:06] <arschmitz> likely part of why you had thought about it before
[09:46:14] <arschmitz> we display it as a dialog
[09:46:21] <arschmitz> which is obviously not an option
[09:46:57] <arschmitz> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/selectmenu-custom/ click the second one
[09:47:42] <arschmitz> for mobile devices the best option is to fall back to native
[09:47:56] <arschmitz> since scrolling a popup is going to be insane
[09:49:50] <arschmitz> we had talked about at one point adding a check to see if a device supports softkeyboard style native selection and using a fallback in this case
[09:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's discuss this in -dev.
[09:51:46] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:55:58] <arschmitz> nothing here
[09:56:04] <fnagel> nope
[09:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev.
[10:00:54] <agcolom> Thanks!
[10:01:04] <arthurvr> I’m here
[10:01:06] <agcolom> Meeting time for Content!
[10:01:08] <arthurvr> Tho I don’t know for how long
[10:01:12] <arthurvr> `contentteam
[10:01:12] <b-ot> arthurvr: agcolom arschmitz arthurvr AurelioDeRosa danheberden gnarf kswedberg RWhitbeck scott_gonzalez sfrisk
[10:01:13] <AurelioDeRosa> Meeting time! :)
[10:01:25] <agcolom> Cool!
[10:02:13] <agcolom> ok, so after my crazy time stopped, I had the flu!
[10:02:26] <agcolom> better now :-)
[10:02:33] <arthurvr> Good to hear that!
[10:02:36] <agcolom> so let's get started...
[10:02:47] <agcolom> GSOC...
[10:02:53] <agcolom> Currently no proposal for issue tracking
[10:03:18] <agcolom> but I have a 2nd year student working on this over the summer anyway for his final year project.
[10:03:43] <arthurvr> That’s good news! awesome
[10:04:17] <arschmitz> agcolom: is she not interested in getting paid for it :-)
[10:04:19] <agcolom> so if we don't get anyone through GSOC, there will still be someone working on this. His plan will be to get most of it done between May (after the exams) and when teaching starts again mid/emd Sept
[10:04:22] <arschmitz> he i mean
[10:04:38] <agcolom> He has exams for now
[10:04:51] <agcolom> Like in May and courseworks...
[10:04:57] <arschmitz> gotcha
[10:05:24] <agcolom> yes, it's not terribly friendly for our students in terms of time
[10:05:47] <agcolom> He needs to submit his project in April 2016...
[10:06:10] <agcolom> now for hte interactive tutorials..
[10:06:25] <agcolom> we have 3 proposals and I'm expecting at least one more
[10:06:36] <agcolom> After discussion with various team members and Kris, it was decided that the additional infrastructure for the initially proposed project (backend using node and a mySQL database) could be a risk for hte long-term maintenance. Instead, we can improve the current jQuery Learning Center (learn.jquery.com) by adding small entries for users to test their understanding, for which http://koans.herokuapp.com/en s
[10:06:36] <agcolom> eems to be a good solution, so for example, where we have http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/getting-started/#jquery-ui-basics-using-options we could add something like http://jsbin.com/gofirumecu/1/edit?html,js,output (we could only present the user with a small data entry to get the code required, and give them some feedback on the correctness using qunit)
[10:06:50] <agcolom> All students working on their proposal have been informed.
[10:07:23] <agcolom> I think that could be a nice improvement for the time being.
[10:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, node and MySQL don't seem like very big long-term risks.
[10:07:32] <arschmitz> agcolom: did you read the discussion in the GSoC skype yesterday
[10:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming the code is robust.
[10:07:43] <arschmitz> on this topic
[10:07:49] <agcolom> yes
[10:08:05] <agcolom> It was more the time and money required to maintain this.
[10:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that's a real concern.
[10:09:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: the discussion im refering to was options that dont actually require infrstructure
[10:09:25] <agcolom> arschmitz: no I missed that
[10:09:28] <arthurvr> Yeah we had a discussion afterwards
[10:09:31] <arschmitz> and woudl reduce maitnence cost
[10:10:30] <arschmitz> basic idea was have a folder in a repo meaybe the learn repo in this there would be folde each of which would be a tutorial
[10:10:43] <arschmitz> the folder would have a read me with instructions and sample files to work with
[10:10:57] <arschmitz> to complete the person would fork the repo
[10:11:08] <arschmitz> and modify the sample files to complete the task in the instructions
[10:11:25] <arschmitz> to test the solution each folder would have a qunit test file
[10:12:02] <arschmitz> an chrome / firefox extension could load the sample files from the repo / local and inject qunit and the test file to evaluate the solution
[10:12:23] <arschmitz> this way it encourages real work flows and allows use of a real editor
[10:12:29] <agcolom> wouldn't that be a bit complex for someone to just try things out?
[10:12:32] <arschmitz> and it has no infrastructiure burden
[10:12:55] <arthurvr> I really like that idea. It feels much more real life and is in any way more maintainable.
[10:13:05] <arschmitz> well is the goal to have turorials or interactive smaple those seem a lot different
[10:13:15] <agcolom> right.
[10:13:20] <arschmitz> trying things out is more of a jsbin interactive sample not a tutorial
[10:13:28] <agcolom> So I almost see this as 2 projects.
[10:14:03] <arschmitz> jsbin interactive samples could be easily done once we have this in place for ui demos
[10:14:15] <agcolom> One is to improve the current articles.
[10:14:29] <agcolom> with small sample code for the user to try
[10:14:50] <arschmitz> ok thats where jsbins would make sense i think
[10:14:57] <agcolom> and that's where the example proposed by scott_gonzalez works nicely
[10:15:10] <arschmitz> we are not teaching them or giving a tutorial its just sample code
[10:15:14] <agcolom> yes
[10:15:54] <agcolom> the other project (which I now see as much more long term) would be something along the lines of what Khan Academy is proposing with their code talkthroughs
[10:16:39] <agcolom> and proper tutorials where the user has to follow instructions to complete step by step a small project
[10:18:01] <agcolom> (which could be as simple as create a three jQuery Mobile pages, with a panel that contains a listview widget with links to page2 and page3, and each page has an automatic back button
[10:19:01] <agcolom> what do you think?
[10:19:34] <arschmitz> so personally my thoughts are this
[10:20:19] <arschmitz> i think anything requireing any real infrastructure are a bad idea we already have enough trouble maintining the current learn site. and we wont have continuing developer time to maintain this after GSoC
[10:20:42] <arthurvr> I totally agree with arschmitz
[10:20:44] <arschmitz> so i would say we should opt for as simple as possible just use jsbins for code samples
[10:21:10] <arschmitz> and for tutorials i dont see it getting much simplier then a folder with a test file and samples
[10:21:42] <arschmitz> it leaves no burden on us of maintenance other then keep them up to date like any other page on the learn site
[10:22:14] <arschmitz> and it requires no persistence of information in a database or other wise it does not even require a server to run on
[10:22:52] <arschmitz> It also encourages the use of real workflows for developers and people learning a like which i feel we should encourage
[10:23:11] <arschmitz> it also still leaves room to just edit in the github editor if people dont want to fork and use git local
[10:23:46] <agcolom> arschmitz: right, so just using the github editor would work?
[10:24:10] <arschmitz> and it introduces no new technologies or tools or anything else into our development or maintenance stack we don't use already
[10:24:13] <arschmitz> yes
[10:24:33] <arschmitz> thats the idea anyway
[10:25:02] <agcolom> right that sounds good but somehow I'm not seeing how this works
[10:25:02] <arschmitz> it wouldwork similar to jquery PR where it would show if its on a fork of the repo
[10:25:31] <arschmitz> and you could click and run the tests against the current files to evaluate your solution
[10:26:31] <agcolom> so we would provide 2 files per turorial exercise?
[10:26:32] <arthurvr> I’m totally +1 on all Alex said. If we’re already having a hard time to stay on top of the 70 tickets in the api site, we really can’t maintain an extra service and its infrastructure.
[10:26:50] <arschmitz> arthurvr: well it was half your idea lol
[10:26:59] <arthurvr> :p
[10:27:49] <agcolom> ok, that sounds good.
[10:28:35] <agcolom> I think it would be good if the system is as simple as possible for the user to use.
[10:28:37] <agcolom> and learn
[10:28:56] <arthurvr> for sure
[10:29:19] <agcolom> arschmitz: arthurvr: do you think one of you could write a few paragraphs to explain this and how it would work?
[10:29:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: sure i might even be able to make a proof of concept
[10:30:02] <agcolom> that would be amazing!
[10:30:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: another advantage of this
[10:30:33] <arschmitz> is because there is no infrastructure or tooling really to make
[10:30:47] <arschmitz> we could have them focus on creating content rather then creating a framework
[10:30:47] <agcolom> that's all good
[10:31:03] <arthurvr> Go wild Alex :D Sounds all awesome. I’ll be available next week again so ping me if you need my help
[10:31:32] <arschmitz> arthurvr: awesome i know you have worked with extensions as well so would be good to get some help there
[10:31:45] <agcolom> I'd like to inform the 3/4 students working on a proposal...
[10:32:12] <arthurvr> I worked on some extensions yeah, feel free to ping me :p
[10:32:25] <arthurvr> Yeah. Are they hanging out on irc?
[10:32:31] <agcolom> Do you think you can have some explanation for them soon? (deadline for proposals is 27th :-( )
[10:32:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: sure i can type something up
[10:33:18] <agcolom> brilliant! Thanks. We can send them the info on the GSOC portal
[10:33:43] <agcolom> and I can reach out to the other one who hasn't submitted yet on IRC.
[10:34:10] <arthurvr> splendid
[10:34:18] <agcolom> Yes, and creating content is also something I'll be able to help them with ;-)
[10:35:57] <agcolom> Ok, I've added this in the notes: Discussion: we’ll investigate also another system (proposed by Arthur and Alex) that requires no infrastructure. Just sample code and unit test using QUnit
[10:36:04] <agcolom> Is this correct?
[10:36:08] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:36:42] <arthurvr> sgtm
[10:37:42] <agcolom> ok, actions from last meeting...
[10:38:13] <agcolom> no progress on my part (being ill) so actions carried forward.
[10:38:19] <agcolom> Aurelio to see how we can get more help from the community
[10:38:31] <agcolom> Blog Post ready.
[10:38:34] * arthurvr had exams, so didn’t do anything too :(
[10:38:40] <arthurvr> And yay for the blogpost
[10:38:47] <agcolom> well exams are important!
[10:39:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: can we publish the blog post?
[10:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> Why not?
[10:39:33] <agcolom> (I don't think I have an account). or should AurelioDeRosa publish himself?
[10:39:33] <arthurvr> Yup. It’s ready to go I think?
[10:39:41] <agcolom> yes, it is.
[10:39:41] <scott_gonzalez> AurelioDeRosa should publish.
[10:39:55] <AurelioDeRosa> ok
[10:40:02] <agcolom> Thanks.
[10:40:02] <AurelioDeRosa> I'll do that
[10:40:28] <agcolom> Thank you AurelioDeRosa!
[10:40:31] <arthurvr> Awesome
[10:41:05] <AurelioDeRosa> But I don't have the privilege to publish it right now
[10:41:29] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^
[10:41:35] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:42:05] <AurelioDeRosa> My bad
[10:42:09] <AurelioDeRosa> I can :)
[10:42:16] <AurelioDeRosa> Should I publish it right now?
[10:42:40] <agcolom> +1 from me
[10:44:24] <arthurvr> +1 here too
[10:44:49] <arschmitz> go for it
[10:44:52] <AurelioDeRosa> OK. Doing it right now!
[10:45:07] <arthurvr> published :)
[10:45:13] <agcolom> and it's up!
[10:45:16] <agcolom> thanks a lot!
[10:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> TWEET
[10:46:04] <arthurvr> Does the tweet from @jquery happen automatically?
[10:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, someone has to do it.
[10:46:26] <arthurvr> Who can do that for us?
[10:46:32] <arschmitz> no its not its not pun filled enough
[10:46:40] <arschmitz> thats why we have ajpiano
[10:46:57] <arschmitz> we need all the puns
[10:47:13] <arthurvr> lol
[10:47:59] <agcolom> would "Come help the #jQuery Foundation http://blog.jquery.com/2015/03/25/come-help-the-jquery-foundation/  " be ok?
[10:48:10] <agcolom> or the jQuery Foundation needs you...

[10:55:01] <b-ot> agcolom: @agcolom: If the #jQuery Foundation projects have saved you work & frustration, this is the right time to give something back http://t.co/hIkx2wFD4d
[10:56:42] <agcolom> Spider:
[10:56:42] <agcolom> http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Websites/job/stage.api.jquerymobile.com/1/console
[10:57:14] <agcolom> so that was good to see what we can get out of it and all the issues that need fixing ;-)
[10:57:48] <arthurvr> Yup
[10:58:00] <arschmitz> http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Websites/
[10:58:09] <arschmitz> that runs every night for each site
[10:58:41] <arschmitz> and sadly that stage.jquerymobile.com is not really green
[10:59:03] <arschmitz> phantomjs crashed and for somereason it reports that as a pass
[10:59:19] <arschmitz> :-/
[11:00:10] <agcolom> So I'll be looking at this in the next few weeks and fix issues on mobile api docs
[11:00:44] <agcolom> Genesis script:
[11:00:44] <agcolom> Not had a chance to discuss further.
[11:00:56] <agcolom> unless arschmitz did with scott_gonzalez?
[11:01:06] <arschmitz> nope
[11:01:31] <agcolom> ok, should we leave it for now and talk again at the next meeting?
[11:01:35] <arthurvr> Guess we’ll have to punt that item then
[11:02:59] <agcolom> Also, I'll be away for 2 weeks from Saturday for holiday
[11:03:32] <agcolom> no internet (so will be relying on the neighbour's internet which may not be great...
[11:04:06] <arthurvr> k
[11:04:11] <agcolom> hence I won't be around for the next meeting in 2 weeks. Should we cancel or does anyone else want to run it?
[11:04:33] <arthurvr> will we have much to discuss?
[11:04:40] <arthurvr> gsoc maybe?
[11:04:53] <arthurvr> we can just do that in jquery-content anyways
[11:05:13] <agcolom> yes,
[11:06:10] <AurelioDeRosa> As I said, if we have't something important to discuss we can cancel it
[11:06:17] <arthurvr> Yeah +1
[11:06:26] <agcolom> ok, so I'll await Alex's notes on the changes to the interactive tutorials project and will notify the stduents
[11:06:32] <agcolom> ok, no meeting in 2 weeks.
[11:06:48] <arthurvr> Okay guys. Gotta run. Seeya in 4 weeks.
[11:07:03] <agcolom> thanks all,
[11:07:10] <agcolom> see you on -content
[11:07:32] <agcolom> any questions from the community?
