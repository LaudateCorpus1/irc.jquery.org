[07:08:27] <rxaviers> Hi Nikerabbit, iskren, santhosh, siebrand, jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, tj_vantoll1
[07:08:51] <rxaviers> I guess this meeting today will be pretty much you and me Nikerabbit rssr
[07:09:44] <Nikerabbit> ug
[07:11:04] <jzaefferer> I'm here, too
[07:11:20] <jzaefferer> There was a doc for agenda/minutes, right?
[07:11:20] <rxaviers> Im not sure if there's much to say. Last week I have talked on San Diego (http://events.jquery.org/2014/san-diego/) about the new Globalize/CLDR. So, while it's been great to spread the word about the news on Globalize, I haven't too much time to word on it.
[07:11:33] <jzaefferer> You mean "work"?
[07:11:39] <rxaviers> hey jzaefferer, yeap there is
[07:11:41] <jzaefferer> Seems like you had plenty words on it :-)
[07:12:27] <Nikerabbit> moment.js was included in mediawiki core (just learned this today)
[07:12:27] <rxaviers> is this one? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8X33uphHUeUEhX8AYU4GZ4DrPPGxbbpuydqShDO-Gw/
[07:13:03] <rxaviers> s/word/work :p
[07:13:04] <Nikerabbit> rxaviers made some plans with me about relative time support on globalize, which I've failed to execute so far
[07:13:35] <rxaviers> Interesting news
[07:13:41] <rxaviers> No problem
[07:14:20] <rxaviers> I will work on the number module, so hopefully I will have updates about it in the next meeting.
[07:15:06] <rxaviers> Does anyone have anything else?
[07:15:38] <jzaefferer> Is there a ticket or something for the relative time support?
[07:15:55] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/205
[07:16:24] <jzaefferer> There's one for the number module, too, right?
[07:16:36] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/200
[07:16:37] <rxaviers> :)
[07:16:53] <jzaefferer> I like adding links to tickets in meeting minutes.
[07:17:00] <jzaefferer> Makes it much easier to keep track of tasks and follow-ups
[07:17:14] <jzaefferer> too bad no one from moment.js made it
[07:17:30] <rxaviers> Sure, and thanks for handling the minutes. It helps a lot :-)
[07:17:35] <jzaefferer> I've been using moment.js in a project, building a calendar.
[07:18:17] <jzaefferer> I wonder if they would add methods for generating data to render calendars, similar to what the "date plugin" in UI's datepicker branch is doing
[07:18:59] <jzaefferer> if that doesn't belong in moment either, maybe I'll just make that a standalone library, built on top of moment.js, that we could use in UI (along with other externals)
[07:19:00] <rxaviers> Yeap, I would like to know what's Iskren plans for CLDR as well. If it meets our expected window for datepicker, we could include it in this rewrite.
[07:19:06] <jzaefferer> I need that anyway for my calendar project
[07:19:32] <jzaefferer> Can you email Iskren separetly and ask for an update? Could include that in the minutes
[07:19:45] <rxaviers> Sure ,and will let you know.
[07:22:28] <rxaviers> ok, so we'll hopefully get moment.js updates by email. Anything else?
[07:22:44] <jzaefferer> Not from me
[07:23:15] <rxaviers> I guess this is a short meeting
[07:23:43] <Nikerabbit> looks so
[07:23:47] <rxaviers> Nikerabbit, please just let me know if you need my help on anything about the relative support.
[07:24:20] <Nikerabbit> rxaviers: yeah
[07:24:48] <rxaviers> thanks everyone
[11:00:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ gseguin|away
[11:00:34] <agcolom> Hi
[11:00:52] <uGoMobi> hey Anne, didn't you just say you couldn't make it today
[11:00:53] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:01:12] <agcolom> Hi can make it, G can't
[11:01:49] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:02:03] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[11:02:08] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:02:17] <agcolom> Hey _|Nix|_ :-)
[11:03:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you here?
[11:04:20] <uGoMobi> ok let's start
[11:04:40] <_|Nix|_> L
[11:04:42] <_|Nix|_> Sorry!
[11:04:57] <uGoMobi> last week we had an in-person meeting, so we didn't have a meeting on IRC
[11:05:16] <arschmitz> here sorry
[11:05:34] <uGoMobi> we discussed things like the new CSS framework, download builder, and bower
[11:05:37] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:06:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you should have access to the agenda/notes
[11:07:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I added the stuff about the external toolbars.
[11:07:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, I meant the notes from last week's in-person meeting
[11:07:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can give you the link later
[11:07:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, right.
[11:07:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - that'd be good.
[11:07:57] <uGoMobi> we released 1.4.1 during arschmitz his talk at the conf :D
[11:08:23] <uGoMobi> nice first maintenance release with over 50 fixes!
[11:08:35] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure!
[11:08:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you work on the changelog?
[11:08:55] <arschmitz> yeah its taking a little bit because the script didnt work
[11:09:31] <uGoMobi> do we know why it failed?
[11:09:50] <arschmitz> well its not implemented yet for github issues
[11:10:12] <arschmitz> for 1.4 we used a script i wrote that ran before the release
[11:10:24] <arschmitz> but then we switched to the new release script
[11:10:31] <uGoMobi> I see, the UI script
[11:10:35] <arschmitz> and that does not work for github issues
[11:10:47] <uGoMobi> :(
[11:10:57] <arschmitz> i tried to use the old one
[11:11:02] <uGoMobi> can we generate the changelog with that old script?
[11:11:07] <arschmitz> but other changes are making it fail
[11:11:10] <uGoMobi> +1
[11:11:24] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:11:25] <arschmitz> like we changed out commit message format
[11:12:56] <uGoMobi> we also have some problems with the download builder
[11:13:05] <arschmitz> yup
[11:13:17] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away isn't here, so I don't know if he started to look into it
[11:13:33] <arschmitz> he said he was going to but not sure if he has had time
[11:13:41] <uGoMobi> I remember him saying the specific reason why it was failing
[11:13:52] <arschmitz> it works on master
[11:14:01] <arschmitz> which is odd
[11:14:02] <uGoMobi> but don't remember what it was exactly
[11:14:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:14:16] <uGoMobi> yeah it was an odd server thing
[11:14:28] <arschmitz> ok
[11:14:49] <uGoMobi> I'll send gseguin|away an e-mail after the meeting to ask if he can update us about the status
[11:15:08] <uGoMobi> and tell us if he can work on it or not
[11:15:11] <arschmitz> sounds good i started to look into it but didnt figure anything out
[11:15:17] <uGoMobi> maybe we need help from infra team
[11:15:28] <arschmitz> so if he knows cause but does not have time i can take it from there
[11:16:11] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:16:24] <uGoMobi> I'll cc you on the email arschmitz
[11:16:35] <uGoMobi> last thing is the theme roller update
[11:16:51] <uGoMobi> I actually did that on the plane, but the PR needs to be reviewed
[11:17:39] <arschmitz> ok i didnt see the pr ill check it out
[11:17:59] <uGoMobi> maybe I forgot to add comment to ask you to review
[11:18:13] <uGoMobi> would be great if we can land that
[11:18:29] <arschmitz> yup
[11:18:33] <uGoMobi> anything else about the 1.4.1 release?
[11:18:50] <arschmitz> we need to test things better in the future
[11:18:53] <arschmitz> like the demos
[11:18:54] <agcolom> talking about PR reviews, it'd be good also if arschmitz and/or uGoMobi could review https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pulls
[11:19:16] <agcolom> so that we can land the ones that are ok.
[11:19:27] <arschmitz> no problem
[11:19:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok
[11:19:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: anyone on the theme can review API docs PR's
[11:19:38] <arschmitz> PR reviews are my priority for next few days
[11:19:40] <uGoMobi> s/theme/team/
[11:19:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[11:19:52] <_|Nix|_> One place where not testing on multiple platforms has bitten us is the $.fn.animationComplete.default thing ...
[11:20:11] <_|Nix|_> How do core and UI use BS to test on multiple platforms?
[11:20:15] <agcolom> yes, I did comment on the style/format. But I'd like one of you to review what touches on funtionalities/code explanation
[11:20:17] <uGoMobi> is that why the panel close animation doesn't work anymore?
[11:20:17] <arschmitz> testswarm
[11:20:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no unrelated
[11:20:32] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:20:33] <arschmitz> but there is a pr to fix both
[11:20:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We had a testswarm effort earlier, but we didn't finish it, right?
[11:20:51] <uGoMobi> ok nice
[11:20:59] <_|Nix|_> Maybe we should give it another look ...
[11:21:02] <arschmitz> yes all by former team members at this point
[11:21:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for sure
[11:21:16] <arschmitz> i talked with the browser stack guys at the conf
[11:21:30] <_|Nix|_> ... although we should probably remove all tests, turn on testswarm, and then add them back in one-by-one.
[11:21:33] <arschmitz> and they are working on some new testing infra we will have access to soon
[11:21:41] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!
[11:21:50] <arschmitz> on actual devices not emulators
[11:22:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow!
[11:22:00] <arschmitz> for any js unit tests
[11:23:07] <uGoMobi> right, that is going to be really nice
[11:23:25] <_|Nix|_> We just need to hook into it.
[11:23:32] <arschmitz> this is something gseguin|away and i were talking about last week though
[11:23:41] <arschmitz> that we need to get on testswarm
[11:23:47] <arschmitz> and fix our tests
[11:24:06] <arschmitz> we have many tests that are designed in such a way they cant possibly test on all the platforms we support
[11:24:15] <arschmitz> pass*
[11:25:19] <uGoMobi> 1.4.2 vs 1.5 changes
[11:25:25] <arschmitz> yes
[11:25:56] <arschmitz> i would like to try and land all the 1.4.2 prs currently open before we make any directory changes or things like that
[11:25:59] <uGoMobi> we have a 1.4-stable branch now, but would be nice if we can land open PR's before changing file structure on master
[11:26:17] <uGoMobi> yeah, the 1.4.x stuff
[11:26:36] <arschmitz> so i propose we for the next week focus just on landing all open prs
[11:26:43] <uGoMobi> +1
[11:26:46] <arschmitz> and release 1.4.2 the end of next week
[11:27:05] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:27:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: before we make code changes for removing style options we should make a document first anyway
[11:27:38] <arschmitz> gseguin|away: yesterday said he was good with this also
[11:27:42] <uGoMobi> so we can start with that
[11:27:46] <uGoMobi> great
[11:28:05] <arschmitz> ha ha i can try and release on stage again lol
[11:28:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:28:19] <arschmitz> i have jquery europe next friday
[11:28:33] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:28:40] <uGoMobi> we release at each conference
[11:28:44] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:29:18] <arschmitz> then i dont have to take those slide out ha ha just change the 1 to a 2
[11:29:29] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:29:33] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:30:02] <uGoMobi> ok, file structure changes on master after next week
[11:30:45] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7134
[11:31:27] <arschmitz> thats a bug it should check for external
[11:31:40] <arschmitz> and account for such
[11:31:50] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if it's a bug
[11:31:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ?
[11:32:11] <uGoMobi> we are talking about a non-fixed footer
[11:32:51] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, the point was to deal with totally normal, but external headers and footers.
[11:32:51] <uGoMobi> internal footer comes right after the content
[11:33:02] <uGoMobi> external comes after the page
[11:33:28] <uGoMobi> the min-height for page is same in both cases
[11:33:29] <arschmitz> ohhh i gotcha
[11:33:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but if we stretch the page to the size of the window, we're not taking into account external toolbars.
[11:33:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is that intentional?
[11:34:12] <uGoMobi> so you're saying we should reduce the height of the page by the height of the footer?
[11:34:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, a page with an external footer will always have a scrollbar, even if there is no content.
[11:34:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not sure.
[11:35:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'd vote for consistency between external and internal toolbars, or at least for defining a policy that we can stick to.
[11:35:30] <arschmitz> yeah i think it should account for external toolbars
[11:35:35] <uGoMobi> but we can't make them constistent
[11:35:46] <uGoMobi> consistent*
[11:35:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why not? We can make it so if there's an external footer, we don't stretch the page at all.
[11:36:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way it'll look the same as if the footer was internal.
[11:36:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the page is themed
[11:36:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, good point - suppose the theme had a gradient.
[11:36:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, the gradient would extend past the internal footer.
[11:37:03] <uGoMobi> gradient or not, if your page is black you don't want to see the white body at the bottom
[11:37:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, as things are now, the page ends below the footer.
[11:37:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I see your thinking.
[11:37:36] <uGoMobi> the page has to be at least the same height as the window
[11:37:51] <uGoMobi> or we reduced by the height of external toolbars
[11:38:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then I vote for reducing the height.
[11:38:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, then an external footer looks like a fixed footer, as you say.
[11:38:19] <uGoMobi> but then a footer will still be at a different position if you compare internal and external
[11:38:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[11:38:28] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[11:38:59] <uGoMobi> so I think this is just a logical result of markup order
[11:39:03] <_|Nix|_> OK, so if our primary goal is to cover the entire window with the themed background, then we will also have this internal/external footer inconsistency.
[11:39:24] <uGoMobi> something I would like to look into for a future version is an absolute position footer
[11:39:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno though. If you have an internal footer, why would the page not end with the footer?
[11:39:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes! bottom: 0 for a footer would be really nice.
[11:40:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then we can stretch the page.
[11:40:09] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:40:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's currently preventing us from doing that?
[11:40:43] <uGoMobi> new feature
[11:40:57] <_|Nix|_> Well, then we can play with it for 1.5.0.
[11:41:15] <uGoMobi> so we can look into it for 1.5 if we have time for that
[11:41:18] <_|Nix|_> ... although we have soooo much to play with :)
[11:41:43] <uGoMobi> I also don't really like to add new features while we still have many issues to fix (fixed toolbar issues)
[11:41:48] <_|Nix|_> The other thing we should look at is the broken slide transition ( https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7135)
[11:42:16] <arschmitz> thats not the right issue i think
[11:42:17] <uGoMobi> anyway, question for now is if we should reduce the page height by the height of the toolbars
[11:42:32] <arschmitz> also thats an issue with the demo the external toolbars are not managed in any way
[11:42:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right, sorry!
[11:42:42] <arschmitz> nor should the be
[11:42:49] <uGoMobi> yeah, different issue
[11:42:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so we make a false claim in the demo.
[11:42:54] <arschmitz> right
[11:43:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll adjust the issue.
[11:43:35] <arschmitz> we considered management like that as an issue early on and decided against it
[11:43:48] <_|Nix|_> Gah ... cant find the slide-broken issue.
[11:44:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im guessing this is related to some issues we addressed shortly before release
[11:44:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you still think it's a bug that we don't reduce page height of pages with external toolbars?
[11:45:02] <arschmitz> i think all three of us worked on them with the position for external and pages durring transitions
[11:45:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The slide transition is broken because the page, as it slides in, is below the page that is sliding out, because of flow.
[11:45:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right we worked on this before
[11:45:34] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:45:46] <arschmitz> it was fixed at some point so i think we regressed
[11:45:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really? I'll bisect.
[11:46:12] <arschmitz> unless it was something that was too late to fix before final but i dont think so
[11:46:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do you remember this?
[11:46:52] <uGoMobi> I am trying
[11:47:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as far as page height im a little tossed
[11:47:09] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! I'm sure I created a bug about the broken slide transition ... now I can't find it.
[11:47:30] <_|Nix|_> Although I guess I must not have ...
[11:47:30] <uGoMobi> was this about page having position absoltute instead of relative?
[11:47:34] <arschmitz> it seems like if we are going to set height in js of the page it should take into account footer
[11:47:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[11:47:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's another problem I noticed.
[11:47:54] <uGoMobi> I do remember now
[11:48:10] <arschmitz> and i think we had to do some juggeling with it durring the course of the transition
[11:48:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When you start the transition, the external footer jumps to the top of the page, because the page, IINM, gets removed from the flow.
[11:48:19] <uGoMobi> right
[11:48:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we decided to not fix that
[11:48:39] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK.
[11:48:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because it in essence just hides right?
[11:48:59] <arschmitz> and then pops back at end
[11:48:59] <uGoMobi> I do remember we consider some thing acceptable, even though not perfect
[11:49:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I've sometimes seen it briefly at the top of the page.
[11:49:48] <_|Nix|_> We might be able to wedge open the space between the top of the window and the footer with a temporary div.
[11:49:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if thats the case we should try and fix that if possible but we decided it was ok to not have it flow correctly
[11:50:13] <arschmitz> and pop in at end
[11:50:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I think we should first fix the slide transition and then worry about this.
[11:50:44] <arschmitz> for sure
[11:51:01] <uGoMobi> I agree
[11:51:21] <_|Nix|_> OK, so subtract external toolbars from page height or not? What's the verdict?
[11:52:15] <_|Nix|_> I vote yes, because it doesn't make sense to me that a document that's almost empty should have a vertical scrollbar just because it has an external toolbar.
[11:52:16] <uGoMobi> maybe it is the best solution
[11:52:17] <arschmitz> i think i personally would subtract
[11:52:36] <uGoMobi> just not sure if this is a bug and is something we can change in 1.4.x
[11:53:05] <arschmitz> i think its a bug because its not a css issue its a jsbug we reset to an incorrect height
[11:53:06] <uGoMobi> ok, so we are going to substract
[11:53:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it certainly looks like a bug, but I guess people can override $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight()
[11:53:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Care to swing the gavel?
[11:53:24] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:53:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: overriding ^
[11:53:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, rather, re: bug ^
[11:53:56] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:53:58] <arschmitz> i think its a bug and we should fix it
[11:54:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:54:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'm all over that - I think I already have a PR in the pipe.
[11:54:20] <arschmitz> i can tell you that while writing the widget had i noticed this i would have considdered it a bug
[11:54:25] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:54:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, hold on!
[11:54:44] <_|Nix|_> There's an important implication to fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7134
[11:54:54] <_|Nix|_> We need to wait for window.onload.
[11:55:09] <_|Nix|_> Currently we calculate page height upon pagechange.
[11:55:27] <_|Nix|_> That's fine, but the first pagechange doesn't work, because the CSS isn't loaded yet, so the toolbar height is reported incorrectly.
[11:55:27] <uGoMobi> this sounds like a discussion for -dev
[11:55:40] <_|Nix|_> Yeag.
[11:55:43] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:56:14] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss here?
[11:56:58] <arschmitz> dont think so
[11:57:34] <uGoMobi> ok thanks all!
[11:57:40] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
