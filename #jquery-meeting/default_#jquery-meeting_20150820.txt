[09:00:21] <arschmitz> hi
[09:00:48] <jrossi9billion> Hola
[09:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you want to lead this one too?
[09:02:18] <arschmitz> I can im not sure there have been any updates since last week though
[09:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> So let's just start with an open floor :-)
[09:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything to discuss?
[09:02:39] <arschmitz> i have not made any progress on the attribute switch
[09:03:54] <jdalton> hi
[09:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> I guess there's nothing to discuss then.
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm mostly caught up at this point (down to 73 emails), so I should be able to review the test PR before the next meeting.
[09:07:13] <jrossi9billion> scott_Gonzalez: You are ok with the WPT test case we reviewed?
[09:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:07:44] <jrossi9billion> Cool, i will merge
[09:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, progress :-)
[09:10:17] <jrossi9billion> Speaking of progress, you feeling better?
[09:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, though still pretty sore.
[09:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> I get my stitches out tomorrow :-)
[09:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's still painful to straighten my arm or turn my neck.
[09:13:06] <jrossi9billion> Well that's progress. Hope you fully recover soon.
[09:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's it for today.
[09:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:14:10] <jdalton> woop!
[11:03:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: jasperdegroot: cgack: gabrielschulhof: apsdehal1: meeting time
[11:03:23] <cgack> howdy
[11:03:58] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:04:12] <apsdehal1> hi
[11:07:19] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[11:07:40] <arschmitz> sfrisk: too
[11:07:42] <arschmitz> oops
[11:08:43] <arschmitz> ok button stuff
[11:08:54] <arschmitz> all the updates have landed in ui
[11:09:08] <arschmitz> still working on trying to pull them into 1.5 dev along with the breakup
[11:09:27] <arschmitz> but ran into some failing tests that had me stumped for a while
[11:09:37] <arschmitz> fixed now though so should have that pr up soo
[11:09:38] <arschmitz> n
[11:10:49] <arschmitz> almost done with a first draft upgrade guide
[11:11:03] <jasperdegroot> great
[11:12:17] <arschmitz> cgack: i think toolbar is just about ready
[11:12:34] <cgack> lets hope!
[11:12:45] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:14:00] <arschmitz> i need to look over one more time but i think it should probably be good there was onlly line one or two small things last time
[11:14:40] <arschmitz> ohhhh
[11:14:54] <arschmitz> cgack: did you add backcompat for data-role="header/footer" ?
[11:14:59] <arschmitz> when you changed that
[11:15:05] <cgack> of course not
[11:15:06] <arschmitz> we need to make sure we do that
[11:15:06] <cgack> :)
[11:15:22] <arschmitz> and add a couple tests to make sure it works
[11:15:24] <cgack> sounds lke fun
[11:15:30] <arschmitz> ok so maybe one more small thing
[11:15:48] <arschmitz> actually no need for tests the enhancer backcompat does that
[11:16:07] <arschmitz> just make sure the initselector is in the backcompat file
[11:17:49] <arschmitz> cgack: so once thats done its on to navbar correct?
[11:18:39] <cgack> yep, it'll take some fancy cherry-picking to get navbar into 1.5-dev I think since that branch is pretty stale
[11:18:55] <cgack> but who knows, maybe it'll be painless
[11:18:59] <arschmitz> cgack: i think there has been execptionally little change to navbar
[11:19:10] <cgack> sweet
[11:19:13] <arschmitz> jscs thats about it i think
[11:19:45] <cgack> good, well I'll finish up toolbar and move to that
[11:20:02] <arschmitz> 4 commits on 1.5-dev
[11:20:03] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/1.5-dev/js/widgets/navbar.js
[11:21:43] <arschmitz> ok jasperdegroot looks like you have 2 pr's ready to merge
[11:21:55] <jasperdegroot> cgack: the toolbar branch is on your forked repo, right?
[11:22:05] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, just saw that :)
[11:22:13] <jasperdegroot> will do that after the meeting
[11:22:34] <arschmitz> so a couple pr's need some discussion
[11:22:55] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8255
[11:23:00] <jasperdegroot> I noticed a css issue with the buttons in the header
[11:23:13] <jasperdegroot> will check if it still is a problem after toolbar merge
[11:23:18] <jasperdegroot> can't preview that branch
[11:23:18] <arschmitz> is failing only on core 1.8 and i have no idea why and cant figure out why but...
[11:23:44] <arschmitz> since 3.0 is already in beta if we continue like in the past 1.5 will not support core 1.8
[11:24:22] <arschmitz> any thoughts?
[11:24:56] <jasperdegroot> I think scott_gonzalez once mentioned that we shouldn't drop support for a core version if not really needed
[11:25:08] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: that is what ui does
[11:25:14] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:25:15] <arschmitz> but that is not what mobile has always done
[11:25:36] <jasperdegroot> we kinda changed that
[11:25:50] <jasperdegroot> I was about to drop support for a core version when we released 1.4
[11:25:54] <arschmitz> we have always done 3 most recent at time of release
[11:26:00] <jasperdegroot> but didn't because of feedback from scott
[11:26:27] <cgack> jasperdegroot: yes its on y fork
[11:26:40] <arschmitz> which stayed with 1.4 i believe because we did 1.8, 1.9, 1.10
[11:26:41] <jasperdegroot> cgack: ok
[11:26:45] <arschmitz> 1.11 came out after
[11:27:05] <jasperdegroot> ok I don't remember exactly
[11:27:39] <arschmitz> this particular failure is totally wacky
[11:27:46] <arschmitz> the PR pases on its own
[11:27:50] <arschmitz> and 1.5 passes on its own
[11:28:04] <arschmitz> but when you rebase the 1 commit from the pr onto 1.5 it fails
[11:28:08] <jasperdegroot> weird
[11:28:20] <arschmitz> and online on 1.8
[11:28:23] <arschmitz> only
[11:29:18] <arschmitz> cgack: any opinion?
[11:30:10] <cgack> what was the question?  sorry, pulled into dayjob briefly there
[11:30:29] <arschmitz> should we drop support 1.8 in 1.5
[11:30:34] <arschmitz> core 1.8
[11:30:48] <arschmitz> in the past we have always done most recent 3 versions of core
[11:30:59] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do you know usage stats of 1.8?
[11:31:04] <arschmitz> but ui does everything they possibly can
[11:31:43] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no
[11:31:57] <cgack> i'm okay with dropping support for 1.8
[11:32:11] <arschmitz> ok
[11:32:36] <jasperdegroot> me too
[11:32:42] <arschmitz> im leaning towards dropping but there are not many people here today
[11:32:45] <sfrisk> sounds good to me
[11:32:51] <jasperdegroot> mostly because I kinda like to "force" people to upgrade core
[11:32:58] <arschmitz> ok thats a majority then
[11:33:12] <arschmitz> so we will switch our tests on travis and drop 1.8
[11:33:14] <arschmitz> on 1.5
[11:33:18] <sfrisk> Hey, if IE can force people to upgrade now, we should too
[11:33:34] <arschmitz> the next question is about some gross css
[11:33:38] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8241
[11:33:53] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:33:57] <arschmitz> what is worse the gross rule at the end there
[11:34:15] <arschmitz> or having to calculate everything on pageshow that care about dimensions
[11:35:22] <jasperdegroot> I think we should go for the gross css rule
[11:35:36] <arschmitz> while i have a special kind of distast for just how bad that rule is
[11:36:01] <arschmitz> from a user perspective i think i would rather have the library easy to use and include one gross rule
[11:36:01] <jasperdegroot> :not() and *
[11:36:11] <jasperdegroot> can't get more ugly ;)
[11:36:17] <arschmitz> and a !important for extra points
[11:36:23] <jasperdegroot> ah right
[11:36:25] <jasperdegroot> almost forgot
[11:36:32] <sfrisk> needs more nesting
[11:36:34] <jasperdegroot> we really have a winner here
[11:37:04] <arschmitz> the !important does not bother me so much here though
[11:37:12] <arschmitz> as it seems like its actually a valid use
[11:37:27] <arschmitz> its the :not *
[11:38:02] <jasperdegroot> we can prevent the not if we add a class that is opposite of ui-page-active
[11:38:15] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah i was thinking about it
[11:38:24] <arschmitz> and it might not be a bad idea
[11:39:30] <sfrisk> definitely cleaner
[11:39:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: and since i added the classes option to page container thats pretty trivial
[11:39:51] <jasperdegroot> ok let's go for that
[11:40:09] <arschmitz> ui-page-hidden {
[11:40:16] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:40:19] <sfrisk> +1
[11:40:32] <arschmitz> ok sounds good
[11:40:37] <jasperdegroot> +1
[11:40:50] <jasperdegroot> we can't do anything about * and !important
[11:40:51] <arschmitz> ill update that
[11:41:02] <jasperdegroot> because we override user content that we don't know about
[11:41:06] <arschmitz> nope but this is a valid case if there ever was one
[11:41:13] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:41:15] <arschmitz> we dont want any one to be able to over ride it ever
[11:42:18] <arschmitz> ok so accordion
[11:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> Chiming in late, but FWIW jQuery 1.8 has more adoption than 1.9 or 1.10.
[11:43:14] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: not surprised actually last version before the split
[11:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> Though I would think it'd be easy for anyone upgrading jQuery Mobile to also upgrade jQuery.
[11:43:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i agree
[11:43:55] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> It's quite a different situation than UI, where it's easier to upgrade UI than core for many sites.
[11:43:58] <arschmitz> this is also what we have always done and im not aware of anyone complaining
[11:44:07] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah its not a whole framework
[11:44:44] <jasperdegroot> ok let's stick to latest 3 versions
[11:44:52] <arschmitz> generally upgrading mobile is going to be much harder then core
[11:45:05] <sfrisk> so they're already making a big commitment there anyway
[11:45:33] <arschmitz> yup
[11:46:09] <arschmitz> sfrisk: so you updated accordion but i saw you had some questions about options
[11:46:16] <sfrisk> yeah, for icons
[11:46:28] <arschmitz> sfrisk: for options that are objects or arrays you use the array
[11:46:46] <arschmitz> data-icons=[ header: "ui-icon-star" ]
[11:46:57] <arschmitz> data-icons='[ header: "ui-icon-star" ]' i mean
[11:47:25] <jasperdegroot> double quotes inside the object is important
[11:47:29] <arschmitz> just need to make sure you use single quotes
[11:47:34] <arschmitz> outside
[11:47:45] <arschmitz> because otherwise it will parse as a string instead of an object / array
[11:47:55] <sfrisk> okay
[11:48:00] <sfrisk> in that case I'll update it
[11:48:10] <sfrisk> I think the only way I didn't try it is with the []
[11:48:29] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:48:43] <arschmitz> its just a fancy jQuery.data()
[11:48:54] <arschmitz> that pulls those in so it follows the same rules
[11:49:07] <sfrisk> hrmm
[11:49:10] <sfrisk> that may not have worked
[11:49:26] <sfrisk> oh wait
[11:49:27] <sfrisk> one sec
[11:49:49] <arschmitz> ok
[11:50:17] <sfrisk> data-icons='[header: "ui-icon-arrow-d-r", activeHeader: "ui-icon-arrow-d-d"]'
[11:50:27] <sfrisk> like that?
[11:51:18] <sfrisk> because that and data-icons='[ header: "ui-icon-star" ]' still aren't returning any icons
[11:52:00] <jasperdegroot> shouldn't it be.... data-icons='{ "header": "ui-icon-arrow-d-r", "activeHeader": "ui-icon-arrow-d-d"}'
[11:52:12] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah
[11:52:15] <arschmitz> its an object lol
[11:52:24] <arschmitz> :-/
[11:52:42] <arschmitz> associative arrays not so much a think in js
[11:53:46] <sfrisk> header icon works, no on activeHeader
[11:54:43] <sfrisk> wait, now it is
[11:54:45] <sfrisk> shall commit
[11:54:52] <jasperdegroot> magic
[11:54:54] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:55:19] <arschmitz> sfrisk: awesome
[11:55:39] <sfrisk> pushed
[11:55:39] <arschmitz> and thats all i have for today since no gabrielschulhof
[11:55:48] <arschmitz> does anyone else have anything?
[11:55:56] <sfrisk> I also added a demo for theme too
[11:56:16] <arschmitz> sfrisk: execlent thank you
[11:56:22] <jasperdegroot> I might have found the cause for that fixed header change position issue
[11:56:23] <arschmitz> ill try to look at / review that tonight
[11:56:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesome!
[11:56:38] <jasperdegroot> this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4259
[11:56:58] <jasperdegroot> although the cause is described here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8264#issuecomment-132522182
[11:57:44] <arschmitz> oh right
[11:57:49] <arschmitz> i read that alreay
[11:57:54] <arschmitz> i wanted to discuss it
[11:58:05] <jasperdegroot> have to double check if both tickets are about the same thing before closing as duplicate
[11:58:16] <arschmitz> im leaning towards sad part of css transitions
[11:58:27] <arschmitz> not a lot we can do
[11:58:39] <arschmitz> recomend more people use external toolbars?
[11:58:53] <jasperdegroot> yeah was about to recommend that to the OP
[11:59:03] <jasperdegroot> but if you use different toolbars on pages
[11:59:30] <jasperdegroot> it's probably not what you want
[12:00:25] <jasperdegroot> you can't associate an external toolbar with a specific page, right?
[12:04:18] <arschmitz> not directly
[12:04:31] <arschmitz> but you couldwrite special handling for it
[12:04:47] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:07:32] <jasperdegroot> later all
[12:07:47] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: don't forget to turn off the lights ;)
