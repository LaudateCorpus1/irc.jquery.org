[12:09:09] <arschmitz> hi
[12:10:12] <fnagel> he
[12:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> hey everyone
[12:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> So I've had very little time since I got back from vacation.
[12:10:44] <arschmitz> same here
[12:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> So I haven't gotten anything done in a while.
[12:11:16] <fnagel> nothing new from my side, still on wait
[12:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> I wrapped something up yesterday, so hopefully I'll have more time now.
[12:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> But today is full of meetings for me.
[12:11:36] <arschmitz> i added core 3.0 to master and 1-11
[12:11:42] <arschmitz> and landed that pr
[12:11:51] <arschmitz> but thats it didnt get a chance to fix the tests
[12:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> The PR for classes option was merged: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1713
[12:12:00] <arschmitz> been busing preparing mobile 1.5
[12:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> I started looking into the tabs failre.
[12:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> failure
[12:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's a result of this change in core: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/e077ffb083743f4a4b990f586c9d25d787e7b417
[12:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> The test itself seemed odd to me though.
[12:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> So I tracked down where it was introduced: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/59c6f97625cf6f149af7543b1739aa8d22737e6e
[12:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling this is no longer an issue and the test can probably just be deleted.
[12:13:28] <arschmitz> sounds likely
[12:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> That fix that was introduced in 2009 hasn't existed in UI for quite a while.
[12:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> When all of my meetings are over, I'll test the ajax request in our supported browsers to verify.
[12:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to pull 3.0.0 into 1-11-stable as well.
[12:16:17] <arschmitz> its there
[12:16:19] <arschmitz> i did both
[12:16:38] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1-11-stable
[12:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh sure. You did that just now :-P
[12:17:21] <arschmitz> 7 whole minutes ago
[12:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> There were some bugs that came in this week that I want to discuss.
[12:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> For resizable, supporting flexbox: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14997
[12:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how that would work. I haven't used flexbox.
[12:24:11] <arschmitz> iv used it but id have to try it and look it up its been a little bit
[12:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really understand how the example provided would ever work.
[12:24:40] <scott_gonzalez> Both panels have `min-width: 50%`
[12:25:38] <arschmitz> and i dont understand how resizable makes sense with flex
[12:26:24] <arschmitz> one is designed to autosize and flow the other is designed to set a specific size
[12:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the idea is that one flex item has a set width and the other items in the row are flexing based on that first item's size.
[12:28:54] <arschmitz> ok yeah i guess that makes sense
[12:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> This is the other bug I want to discuss:
[12:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> Draggable prevents pinch zoom on Windows 10 touch in Chrome/Edge
[12:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14993
[12:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like draggable is doing the right thing.
[12:29:49] <arschmitz> thinking future
[12:30:00] <arschmitz> that element would get touch-action none anyway
[12:30:07] <arschmitz> which would prevent the pinch zoom
[12:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> It already has touch-action
[12:30:16] <arschmitz> oh right we addedthat
[12:30:21] <arschmitz> ok so yeah its doing the right thing
[12:30:25] <arschmitz> thats how it has to work
[12:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the browser would need to detect a multi-touch gesture and do its own thing, right?
[12:31:00] <arschmitz> this would require what i wanted to add for a value
[12:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> It would be up to the browser to determine that it shouldn't even look at touch-action because of the multi-gesture.
[12:31:47] <arschmitz> the multi touch value i want added
[12:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> Right, the single-point interaction value for touch-action.
[12:32:08] <arschmitz> yup
[12:32:29] <arschmitz> or another one i wanted to propose after that one also
[12:32:57] <arschmitz> something similar to how passive works
[12:33:07] <arschmitz> where you get the evnts ( like mousemove is )
[12:33:17] <arschmitz> but they are non blocking no prevent default etc
[12:34:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping Rick Byers just to confirm there's nothing we can do about this.
[12:34:49] <arschmitz> basicly for when you just want to track a touch but let all the normal things still happen
[12:34:57] <scott_gonzalez> Usually he'll have ideas if there are crazy workarounds.
[12:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> Not that we'd necessarily implement a workaround even if there is one.
[12:35:12] <arschmitz> yeah im interested as well because i was going to make those proposals anyway
[12:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to get a definitive answer from him before responding on the ticket.
[12:37:01] <arschmitz> sounds good
[12:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's all I've got for today.
[12:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'll spend all of my available time on getting tests passing with 3.0 so we can get the releases out.
[12:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[12:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[12:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
