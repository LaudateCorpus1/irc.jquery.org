[11:01:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ agcolom dam__
[11:01:20] <arschmitz> hi
[11:01:27] <uGoMobi> hey
[11:02:30] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:02:35] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:02:53] <agcolom> Hi
[11:02:59] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[11:03:07] <uGoMobi> ok let's start
[11:03:21] <uGoMobi> slider and rangeslider
[11:03:36] <uGoMobi> we deprecated those without offering an alternative
[11:03:48] <uGoMobi> except for flipswitch
[11:04:05] <arschmitz> yeah i was talking to scott about this this morning
[11:04:18] <arschmitz> and he made a VERY convincing argument that we did this wrong
[11:05:01] <arschmitz> they should not be deprecated
[11:05:39] <uGoMobi> it is indeed not the right way to deprecate something
[11:05:49] <uGoMobi> what was Scott his argument?
[11:06:00] <arschmitz> well it should not be deprecated at all
[11:06:06] <arschmitz> because its not going away
[11:06:09] <arschmitz> its just being changed
[11:06:17] <arschmitz> even if its a new widget from a new repo
[11:06:24] <arschmitz> the functionality will always be there
[11:06:27] <arschmitz> with no gap
[11:06:36] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:06:53] <uGoMobi> the reason we did it is was to have our hands free the change API, right?
[11:07:01] <agcolom> sorry I missed a few because I got disconnected from znc. What has been deprecated and shouldn't have been?
[11:07:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: slider and rangeslider
[11:07:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right
[11:07:28] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, thx
[11:07:40] <uGoMobi> so we don't have to deprecate if we change API?
[11:07:47] <uGoMobi> only if we remove a feature?
[11:07:49] <arschmitz> well heres the thing
[11:07:56] <arschmitz> even if its in another repo
[11:08:04] <arschmitz> there is no reason we could not maintain backcompat
[11:08:09] <arschmitz> through an extension
[11:08:27] <arschmitz> so we at that point would deprecate parts of the api and introduce the new
[11:08:35] <arschmitz> just like any other change we make
[11:08:42] <uGoMobi> right
[11:08:58] <arschmitz> and its not like sliders have that many options to have to maintain the api
[11:09:09] <uGoMobi> true
[11:09:19] <arschmitz> like my example to scott was datepicker which they are possibly going to do an api breaking change on
[11:09:28] <arschmitz> but that has like 50 options
[11:09:35] <arschmitz> so its just not reasonable there
[11:09:39] <arschmitz> but slider is pretty simple
[11:09:43] <uGoMobi> yeah, different case
[11:10:08] <uGoMobi> the options for our sliders will probably stay more or less the same
[11:10:15] <arschmitz> so after that i think we should "undeprecate"  them
[11:10:26] <uGoMobi> it's just the code that will be completely rewritten
[11:10:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: api who knows on at this point for options and such
[11:10:51] <arschmitz> but it does not really matter we can deal with that when it comes
[11:11:12] <arschmitz> we will just have to patch some functionality here and there
[11:11:21] <uGoMobi> didn't we put the new slider on the roadmap for 1.6 instead of 1.5?
[11:11:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think so but i would have to check
[11:11:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: TBH, I would wait with the un-deprecation until we have the new slider in place.
[11:12:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why ?
[11:12:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just in case we can't accomplish the API even with an extension.
[11:12:52] <uGoMobi> but still this is not the way to do it
[11:13:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then we just do like with datepicker and say sorry it had to happen
[11:13:15] <arschmitz> because it no longer meets the test of being reasonable
[11:13:28] <arschmitz> but i really dont think that will be a problem
[11:13:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but that's exactly what deprecation is for - to avoid a breaking change from one version to the next.
[11:13:38] <arschmitz> slider has a very simple api
[11:13:51] <_|Nix|_> There's the nice kind of deprecation where the new way overlaps with the old.
[11:14:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's the only way if you ask me
[11:14:09] <_|Nix|_> Then there's the ugly kind of deprecation where you're being told your favourite tool is going to disappear.
[11:14:20] <_|Nix|_> This is in-between.
[11:14:36] <arschmitz> not true
[11:14:38] <arschmitz> You can't deprecate something and say "At some point, we'll just change APIs."
[11:14:45] <arschmitz> That's not helpful to anyone.
[11:14:52] <arschmitz> The point of deprecating something is to give the user time to move to the alternative.
[11:15:17] <uGoMobi> exactly
[11:15:42] <uGoMobi> so we can only deprecate at the moment we have something new
[11:15:50] <arschmitz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation
[11:15:56] <arschmitz> Deprecation is a status applied to a computer software feature, characteristic, or practice indicating it should be avoided, typically because it is being superseded
[11:16:07] <dam__> +1
[11:16:16] <uGoMobi> what we can do is deprecate the flip toggle switch feature of the slider widget
[11:16:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right
[11:16:29] <uGoMobi> better.. should do
[11:16:30] <arschmitz> but not slider and rangeslider
[11:16:50] <uGoMobi> right
[11:17:03] <arschmitz> however we can still of course refuse to make improvments or change anything besides bugs
[11:17:08] <arschmitz> because its being rewritten
[11:17:33] <uGoMobi> yup, that's just a matter of priority/planning
[11:18:12] <_|Nix|_> OK. You guys are right.
[11:18:56] <uGoMobi> ok we edit the message in the 1.4.0 changelog
[11:19:06] <arschmitz> and remove notice on api
[11:19:11] <uGoMobi> right
[11:19:24] <uGoMobi> I don't think there is a note in the code itself
[11:19:25] <_|Nix|_> Issue?
[11:19:32] <uGoMobi> but will double check
[11:19:39] <_|Nix|_> I can jump on it ...
[11:20:02] <uGoMobi> great
[11:20:18] <uGoMobi> next topic is PR reviews
[11:20:31] <arschmitz> im all for assigning to me
[11:20:45] <arschmitz> will make it much easier to see what i need to look at lol
[11:21:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool! Can you then assign back afterwards?
[11:21:00] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:21:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure
[11:21:12] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:21:33] <uGoMobi> maybe first assign only the ones for 1.4.1 bug fixes
[11:21:50] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure.
[11:21:54] <uGoMobi> you can't filter PRs by milestone if I am not mistaken
[11:21:57] <arschmitz> there "Should" not be any others right now lol
[11:22:12] <uGoMobi> oh ok, didn't check all 40 ;-)
[11:22:12] <_|Nix|_> Actually, I think you can.
[11:22:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i was alluding to the fact that we should not be working on anything else right now
[11:22:46] <arschmitz> so there should only be 1.4.1 prs
[11:23:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, but maybe there are some old ones, don't know
[11:23:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i know it was just a joke there are some that we decided to wait on
[11:23:41] <_|Nix|_> Actually, you can filter by milestone and then click "Assigned to me" and you should see both issues and PRs assigned to you.
[11:23:43] <arschmitz> apparently im not funny :)
[11:23:44] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:23:47] <uGoMobi> haha
[11:23:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now you are :D
[11:24:12] <_|Nix|_> You buncha clowns :)
[11:24:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and then all tickets have the "Android" label? ;-)
[11:24:36] * _|Nix|_ cowers behind a large rock
[11:25:19] <uGoMobi> anyways, when we are done with PR reviews we can do a 1.4.1 release
[11:25:32] <_|Nix|_> I will never again check off the checkmark at the top of the issue list. That way be dragons!
[11:25:45] <uGoMobi> and if it's too much work, we review the high priority ones first
[11:26:03] <_|Nix|_> The rest can always go into 1.4.2, right?
[11:26:07] <uGoMobi> and the others can wait until 1.4.2
[11:26:11] <uGoMobi> exactly
[11:26:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah we are making some awesome progress on 1.4.1 issues
[11:26:24] <uGoMobi> I want to do maintenance release more frequently
[11:26:35] <arschmitz> and even some oldies
[11:26:36] <uGoMobi> not wait untile *everything* is done
[11:26:41] <uGoMobi> because we are never done
[11:26:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah awesome
[11:27:36] <uGoMobi> somebody just added AMD to the agenda
[11:27:39] <uGoMobi> what about it?
[11:27:48] <arschmitz> that was me
[11:27:56] <arschmitz> AMD has landed in master for UI
[11:27:59] <uGoMobi> ah, I see the rest of the text now
[11:28:13] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[11:28:14] <uGoMobi> yeah, saw that... nice!
[11:28:28] <arschmitz> bringing us closer to being able to truely interop
[11:28:55] <arschmitz> so now we need to update to the same UMD wrapper they have
[11:28:56] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:29:00] <arschmitz> and ditch our amd one
[11:29:23] <arschmitz> also would be a good time to update our file names and directory structure
[11:29:26] <uGoMobi> shall we start with that after 1.4.1 release
[11:29:30] <uGoMobi> exactly
[11:29:41] <_|Nix|_> So, are we doing the 1.4-stable thing after 1.4.1?
[11:29:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes its a after 1.4.1 thing
[11:29:50] <uGoMobi> so we can create 1-4-stable branch after 1.4.1 release
[11:29:54] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:30:00] <arschmitz> i just wanted to bring it up since it finally landed in ui master
[11:30:03] <_|Nix|_> I always ask 17 seconds too soon :)
[11:30:34] <arschmitz> then we can get rid of the jquery.mobile.tabs.js file too
[11:30:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you know if Hyunsook and team already started to work on removing style options?
[11:30:39] <arschmitz> as thats just an amd wrapper
[11:30:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's Lunar New Year out East right now.
[11:31:02] <uGoMobi> I know
[11:31:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Today's meeting was off.
[11:31:09] <uGoMobi> year of the horse :)
[11:31:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Last week they said they're planning the year, so they haven't had a chance to work on the style removal yet.
[11:31:38] <uGoMobi> that's good
[11:32:08] <uGoMobi> let's do 1.4.1 release next week and then change file structure
[11:32:32] <uGoMobi> after that they can work on removing style options without having to worry about bunch of conflicts
[11:32:40] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[11:32:52] <_|Nix|_> Actually, I don't think file structure should be such a big deal.
[11:33:00] <_|Nix|_> Git is pretty good about tracking files across moves.
[11:34:26] <uGoMobi> ok, is there anything else we need to discuss?
[11:34:34] <uGoMobi> ah, one thing
[11:35:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I noticed you mentioned something about checkboxradio icons during yesterday's UI meeting
[11:35:09] <uGoMobi> about going back to spans
[11:35:09] <arschmitz> indeed
[11:35:16] <uGoMobi> err :after I mean
[11:35:17] <arschmitz> yup
[11:35:29] <arschmitz> no its going to use spans
[11:36:24] <uGoMobi> 18:07 <arschmitz> nothing to discuss its back to where it was with before and after
[11:36:36] <arschmitz> the status of the widget
[11:36:55] <uGoMobi> ok I misunderstood
[11:36:56] <arschmitz> its now back to where it was when it used before and after
[11:37:01] <arschmitz> but now using spans
[11:37:10] <uGoMobi> I thought you tried spans but were moving back to pseudo elements
[11:37:17] <arschmitz> no
[11:37:20] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[11:37:42] <arschmitz> so far spans are actually much cleaner
[11:37:55] <arschmitz> and have had minimal impact on the code
[11:37:58] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[11:38:39] <arschmitz> oh i just thought of something else
[11:38:55] <uGoMobi> talking about cleaner... I am reviewing the icon optimization PR at the moment and I would really like to have a much more simple solution for that in the future
[11:39:13] <arschmitz> for demos using external code is it better to link to a stable tag on github or include in library
[11:39:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lemme get this straigh. checkboxradio uses spans, but we're not doing the buttonMarkup thing where we're doing spans for every single anchor, right?
[11:39:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: link?
[11:39:23] <uGoMobi> I mean, the PR made me aware again of that our icon CSS is confusing
[11:39:58] <arschmitz> every anchor?
[11:40:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6654
[11:40:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we used to have <a href="#"><span class="ui-btn-inner"><span class="ui-btn-text">Click me</span></span></a>
[11:40:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope we're not doing that again.
[11:41:06] <uGoMobi> that doesn't look like a checkbox
[11:41:12] <uGoMobi> but yeah, no more inner markup
[11:41:22] <_|Nix|_> No, that's why I'm making sure that the span thing is restricted to checkboxradio widgets.
[11:41:34] <_|Nix|_> OK, good.
[11:41:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it will be <a href="#"><span class="ui-icon"></span>text</a>
[11:41:42] <arschmitz> that sort of thing
[11:42:06] <arschmitz> so if an anchor has an icon it will have an icon span
[11:42:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but these spans are there a priori, right? No startup DOM manip on our part, right?
[11:42:54] <uGoMobi> BTW - when I pull the changes from that icon PR into a branch and resolved conflicts I ended up with coveralls report directory inside the build directory. something to be aware of.
[11:43:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin will add it to .gitignore
[11:43:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it depends
[11:43:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: a person can add the span and classes them selves
[11:43:41] <arschmitz> or do it with the widget their choice
[11:43:54] <arschmitz> but if they use the widget it will be generated
[11:44:04] <arschmitz> and with checkbox radio it will be generated
[11:44:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but simple anchors no longer have an enhancement step. So, <a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Link</a> is just that. It does not get modified by the framework upon startup anymore - right?
[11:44:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: anything about documentation or other content that needs to be discussed?
[11:45:09] <agcolom> will work on the iframe issue this weekend
[11:45:22] <agcolom> will do one and see if it's a good solution
[11:45:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in that case if you dont call anything on it yourself by adding rold="button" or with js then you will get whatever you put
[11:45:45] <arschmitz> so if you add an icon span you get an icon if you dont you dont
[11:45:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok great
[11:45:50] <agcolom> in the mean time everyone can vote for me at https://thenetawards.com/vote/developer/anne-gaelle-colom/
[11:45:55] <agcolom> :-)
[11:46:01] <arschmitz> there is no js involved so its whatever you put in your markup
[11:46:04] <uGoMobi> yeah awesome
[11:46:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, that's good.
[11:46:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: again, congrats with your nomination
[11:46:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks!!!! :-)
[11:46:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, that's really awesome!
[11:46:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats not really a change though you could do that before when they had 3 spans too
[11:46:52] <arschmitz> thats just css
[11:47:01] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thank you :-)
[11:47:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, you'd risk double-enhancing it before.
[11:47:17] <arschmitz> not if you didnt add data-role="button"
[11:47:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right - true.
[11:47:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ sounds like a nice discussion for -dev
[11:47:33] <arschmitz> we only change the behivor if you add data-role="button"
[11:47:40] <agcolom> gotta run to pick up alex from rock climbing...
[11:47:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, we can move that to -dev
[11:47:48] <uGoMobi> later agcolom
[11:47:49] <arschmitz> what? im rock clibming
[11:47:57] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:47:58] <arschmitz> i should really know these things :)
[11:47:58] <agcolom> absolutely ;-) arschmitz :-)
[11:47:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Didn't you know?
[11:48:09] <agcolom> and I hope you're ready ;-)
[11:48:34] <agcolom> speak later all :-)
[11:48:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: L8R
[11:48:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: L8R
[11:48:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry :)
[11:48:54] <uGoMobi> ok thanks all
[11:49:00] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:49:01] <arschmitz> bye all
