[09:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> hey everyone
[09:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, am I able to talk when I'm an op even while it's muted?
[09:08:08] <kborchers> yep
[09:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> Well that kills my ability to do my easy check :-P
[09:08:25] <kborchers> YOU HAVE THE POWER!
[09:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> I should just always unmute :-p
[09:08:48] * scott_gonzalez sucks at IRC
[09:08:54] <kborchers> lol
[09:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Anything for infrastructure?
[09:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> Trac spam seems to have stopped.
[09:09:40] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez adam's adjustements must have made some happiness :)
[09:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:09:59] <danheberden> no updates sans the overarching issues we've finally made headway on as a team
[09:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:21] <danheberden> assuming gnarf will be ready soon to make server magic
[09:10:29] <danheberden> ;)
[09:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so back to accordion animation...
[09:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> I made some changes to the CSS and now even the new animation code isn't smooth in Firefox :-/
[09:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have time to look into this?
[09:12:01] <kborchers> stupid IE ... err ... wait ... i mean firefox
[09:12:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is it that pull
[09:12:42] <kborchers> ?
[09:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, merge that into master.
[09:13:05] <scott_gonzalez> Or merge master into it.
[09:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> Either way...
[09:13:39] <kborchers> so the css changes are in master already and it broke that pull? is that right?
[09:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice the bottom border on the headers is missing in the branch.
[09:14:37] <kborchers> ok, i'll try to take a look later today
[09:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> The CSS was really busted before.
[09:15:07] <kborchers> so the issue now though is that the animations are not smooth in FF, otherwise, it's good?
[09:15:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. I'm pretty sure it was still good in other browsers.
[09:15:35] <kborchers> ok
[09:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox has been working on the TestSwarm/BrowserStack integration.
[09:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> He has a repo for the integration: https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack
[09:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: How's that coming? Do you need help with anything? I've got time to work on it.
[09:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm going to start testing the new build process
[09:20:18] <clarkbox> i am here
[09:20:28] <clarkbox> its all done
[09:20:42] <clarkbox> it runs the script every 10 min
[09:21:08] <clarkbox> starts workers that are needed. kills workers that are not.
[09:21:29] <clarkbox> but there is the element of the browserstack queue that holds things up on occasion
[09:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. Can we have a quick call with you, me, and jzaefferer at some point (maybe after this meeting) to just go over how everything works?
[09:21:46] <clarkbox> ya sure
[09:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know much about the actual setup for our testing infrastructure.
[09:22:12] <kborchers> ignoring the menu issues which are not related, do we know if there are effects issues in IE or could this be from running via the API? http://swarm.jquery.org/job/733/
[09:22:25] <clarkbox> i think its due to browserstack issie
[09:22:48] <clarkbox> i tested the tests that are marked "Err" and they passed
[09:23:12] <clarkbox> i think that happens when a machine is shut down 1/2 way through a run
[09:23:26] <clarkbox> browserstack only runs tests that have been run 0 times
[09:23:58] <clarkbox> so it does not run a test 3 times. it lets another client attempt. otherwise it would be a fail, and not an err i believe
[09:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> The effects are failures though, not errors.
[09:24:32] <kborchers> but what about the effects that report issues not Err
[09:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> Focus issues actually sound like users, not BrowserStack.
[09:25:01] <clarkbox> i think the same goes for fails
[09:25:03] <clarkbox> http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery-ui/a3abb3b5f5db19196c66a5b25e2c93eec7a0cd1f/tests/unit/effects/effects.html
[09:25:05] <clarkbox> that works locally
[09:25:20] <clarkbox> 733 lists as a fail, which probably came from browserstack
[09:25:25] * scott_gonzalez launches BrowserStack
[09:25:27] <kborchers> hmmm, would be nice to find a way to get those working
[09:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> damn .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729
[09:27:00] <clarkbox> even if you run it in browsercam console... it will pass
[09:27:12] <kborchers> i just got it connected to browserstack and the effects tests pass when run manually
[09:27:13] <clarkbox> its only if its a worker spawned by API
[09:27:22] <kborchers> yep
[09:28:05] <clarkbox> so two issues a) if a browser is shut down mid run, the test can get stuck, and may not be re-issued by testswarm to subsequent clients
[09:28:17] <clarkbox> b) headless workers are causing false fails
[09:28:22] <clarkbox> a is us.
[09:28:25] <clarkbox> b is browserstack
[09:28:32] <clarkbox> ill get in touch with them about B
[09:28:49] <kborchers> would be nice to find find fixes for both of those issues so we can get passing tests (minus my broken menu tests)
[09:28:54] <clarkbox> wait
[09:28:58] <kborchers> stupid IE
[09:29:04] <clarkbox> i think A is moot
[09:29:12] <clarkbox> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/733/
[09:29:13] <jzaefferer> hey guys, sorry for missing half the meeting
[09:29:19] <clarkbox> just ran in VM and its working
[09:29:26] <kborchers> jzaefferer: we will never forgive you :P
[09:29:28] <jzaefferer> putting the finishing touches on my jQuery UK presentation
[09:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: if a browser disconnects mid-test, it will be rerun
[09:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> We do need to fix TestSwarm to not treat them as failures though.
[09:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> A client disconnecting shouldn't cause a build to fail.
[09:30:03] <clarkbox> yes. i knew thats how it was designed. i thought it was getting stuck. disregard.
[09:30:06] <jzaefferer> specifically, sorry clarkbox for not reviewing your popup PR for so long. I'll do that early next week
[09:30:16] <clarkbox> ya no prob
[09:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that's all we had for this meeting.
[09:30:55] <jzaefferer> regarding general testing infrastructure, I should be able to get back in the game next week as well. See how far Justin got by then, if not so much, start developing the Jenkins plugin myself again.
[09:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> So unless anyone else has anything, I think we're done.
[09:31:11] <jzaefferer> at least Justin put together a tutorial on setting up local Jenkins debugging
[09:31:16] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, clarkbox: Can you do a call now?
[09:31:33] <jzaefferer> got about 30mins, yeah
[09:32:06] <clarkbox> give me 30 as well
[09:32:16] <clarkbox> i mean, i can do 30
[09:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we're done.
