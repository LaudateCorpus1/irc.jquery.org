[08:35:18] <leobalter> copy pasting from jquery-dev:
[08:35:20] <leobalter> My next goal is to land that nested modules PR, I would like to hear from JamesMGreene as he also did another PR with the same topic.
[08:35:38] <leobalter> with the nested modules PR, I believe the only major thing we would have to be ready for long waited QUnit 2 is a proper reporter for node.
[08:36:46] <leobalter> QUnit is my favorite test tool (not surprising) and it's great to have our assertions not breaking the rest of the test block when they fail.
[08:37:25] <gibson042> yeah
[08:37:47] <leobalter> so if we make more efforts to support node envs, we might find a good new era for QUnit
[08:38:03] <leobalter> the api is still simple, clean, precise and works fine.
[08:38:26] <leobalter> and it's great on the performance
[08:38:51] <gibson042> I am always surprised when other frameworks bail on the first failing assertion
[08:39:08] <gibson042> QUnit gets it right IMO
[08:39:59] <gibson042> at least, that part ;)
[08:40:00] <leobalter> so, I'm asking everyone's support to land that nested modules and then we should work together on the node reporter (maybe js-reporters is part of this way)
[08:41:10] <gibson042> there will be cleanup between landing #800 and releasing it (as noted), but I think the basic approach is sound
[08:43:26] <leobalter> nice. I'll probably release a patch version for #856 to not delay with a release with #800.
[08:43:37] <leobalter> as we also need to update the docs
[08:44:15] <leobalter> QUnit.only is also on its way.
[08:44:44] <leobalter> as #863 is also ready
[08:44:56] <gibson042> will QUnit.only have module-level scope, or global?
[08:45:37] <leobalter> this is not defined yet, but I would say global
[08:46:37] <leobalter> do you recommend it being module-level scope?
[08:47:42] <gibson042> so it's like providing testId in the HTML UI parameters?
[08:47:55] <leobalter> Yes. The use of QUnit.only is for a faster development process. Having loose QUnit.only on different modules would allow a bad practice.
[08:48:55] <gibson042> interesting
[08:49:03] <leobalter> also, with the nested modules, a entire QUnit.module can be replaced by a QUnit.skip
[08:49:31] <jzaefferer> hello
[08:49:34] <gibson042> so `only` will presumably mark all other tests as skipped?
[08:50:02] <jzaefferer> I think `only` should be more like filter by testId
[08:50:09] <jzaefferer> you don't want the noise of skipped tests
[08:50:29] <jzaefferer> I've been using mocha with .only for a while, for a console runner it seems like the only reasonable option
[08:50:36] <gibson042> but you do want an obvious indication of partial execution
[08:50:56] <gibson042> good point that, though
[08:50:59] <leobalter> we can flag that test as the only test
[08:51:01] <jzaefferer> sure, but thats a more general issue, there's a ticket somewhere
[08:51:05] <gibson042> ok
[08:51:24] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/528
[08:51:31] <jzaefferer> would be nice to address that along with Qunit.only
[08:51:40] <gibson042> agreed
[08:51:49] <gibson042> an across reporters
[08:51:52] <gibson042> *and
[08:53:02] <leobalter> anything else?
[08:53:06] <jzaefferer> about js-reporters
[08:53:36] <jzaefferer> Franziska is going to finish the mocha adapter early October, then we'll have Jasmine, QUnit and Mocha covered
[08:53:46] <jzaefferer> I've been thinking about moving that to the jquery org
[08:54:06] <jzaefferer> and getting some noise going, @jquery on Twitter, post on blog.jquery.com
[08:54:08] <jzaefferer> that might help
[08:54:19] <leobalter> sure
[08:54:35] <jzaefferer> speaking of bigger picture: leobalter, would you be interested in taking over as project lead for QUnit?
[08:55:25] <leobalter> yes, if everyone is ok with that I'm in.
[08:56:51] <jzaefferer> I don't know if there's anyone else to ask. You obviously care about the project, might as well make that more official.
[08:57:20] <jzaefferer> I'll keep helping out where I can
[08:58:03] <leobalter> nice. I hope this helps us to reach QUnit 2 soon
[08:58:09] <jzaefferer> there, now you can mute and unmute this channel ;-)
[08:58:26] <leobalter> thanks
[08:58:37] <jzaefferer> at least as long as you're not going offline
[08:58:53] <leobalter> as long as the ZNC stays up
[08:59:00] <jzaefferer> you can ask Corey to give you more long-lasting access via ChanServ
[08:59:12] <jzaefferer> I don't know how that part works
[08:59:32] <jzaefferer> as for QUnit 2, I'd still like to see all new features added in 1.x releases, like Ember does
[08:59:37] <leobalter> I'll talk to Corey at the office anytime
[08:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ajpiano s5fs should all be able to help you with that.
[08:59:53] <jzaefferer> but since we're getting pretty close, a 2.x shouldn't be too far away either
[09:00:04] <leobalter> sure
[09:00:25] <jzaefferer> maybe Franziska can help implement the js-reporter events in QUnit, when she's done with the mocha reporter
[09:00:58] <jzaefferer> leobalter: I'll ping you about making project lead change official, dunno yet what that involves
[09:01:05] <jzaefferer> otherwise I think we're done here
[09:01:12] <jzaefferer> at least I got nothing else
[09:01:16] <jzaefferer> and its time for UI meeting
[09:01:20] <leobalter> np.
[09:01:22] <leobalter> yes
[09:01:26] <leobalter> thanks!
[09:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[09:01:38] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz fnagel jzaefferer mikesherov rxaviers_ scott_gonzalez tjvantoll
[09:01:49] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:52] <arthurvr> hey
[09:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> So, arschmitz what's up with button right now?
[09:04:00] <arschmitz> waiting for me to update from jzaefferer review last week
[09:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so the current comment is accurate?
[09:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> (in the agenda)
[09:04:55] <jzaefferer> can you paste the link?
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it's a little behind.
[09:05:07] <fnagel> hey, sorry I'm late
[09:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4ieJTELlFeUo9ycooPTqWv0gtIt-44T-47Y2F_100U/edit#gid=967235104
[09:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> No problem fnagel, we just started.
[09:05:47] <jzaefferer> I think the agenda comment still applies
[09:05:49] <arschmitz> yes
[09:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I updated it already :-)
[09:06:00] <jzaefferer> unless Alex sneaked in some commits without any comments
[09:06:04] <arschmitz> no
[09:06:07] <arschmitz> iv been busy
[09:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that brings us to datepicker.
[09:06:41] <jzaefferer> we still have plenty of docs to write
[09:07:02] <jzaefferer> though by now we can consider the new APIs frozen and just write the docs, right?
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> I believe so.
[09:07:40] <jzaefferer> I don't want to mess with Alex' branch, but I can work on docs
[09:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> I've been trying to get through all the random stuff I've started on but never finished.
[09:08:39] <jzaefferer> same for the upgrade guide, no need to wait anymore
[09:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> Once I can get through that stuff, I can help with docs too.
[09:09:17] <jzaefferer> arschmitz, while you're here, https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/113#issuecomment-139283701
[09:09:54] <arschmitz> that can / should land now that demos have
[09:10:03] <arschmitz> though not on master
[09:10:05] <arschmitz> on branch
[09:10:06] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:10:28] <jzaefferer> can you do that now or after the meeting? I still need to set up site repos on my new machine...
[09:11:46] <arschmitz> i can later im in multple meetings for next couple hours
[09:13:01] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:13:38] <jzaefferer> about "CJS" support, which currently means webpack
[09:13:48] <jzaefferer> I consider this ready to land: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1600
[09:14:05] <jzaefferer> We'll still have to aquire owner rights to publish jquery-ui on npm
[09:14:17] <jzaefferer> hopefully Devon will be more responsive on that
[09:14:22] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the PR looks good to me
[09:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with whatever works. You know me, I try to stay out of all these tooling discussions ;-)
[09:15:14] <jzaefferer> are we okay with breaking jquery-ui 1.10.5 to 1.12.0 compat for the npm package?
[09:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> Too many build systems and dependency managers.
[09:15:17] <jzaefferer> I am...
[09:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:15:32] <arschmitz> yes
[09:16:11] <jzaefferer> adding the `main` prop is pretty trivial, so we'll see what people complain about, if at all, and can adjust accordingly
[09:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:16:35] <jzaefferer> changelog/upgrade guide can point to my demo, that one is pretty easy to understand
[09:16:46] <jzaefferer> unlike some other webpack setups that get crazy complicated
[09:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, ones that incorporate every possibly new technology?
[09:17:51] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:18:20] <jzaefferer> looking at `npm search jquery-ui`, https://github.com/gaurav0/ember-cli-jquery-ui is up-to-date; I'll ping them to look at my PR
[09:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Nothing ever happened with that doodle.
[09:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> I guess because Rafael never responded?
[09:19:44] <fnagel> I've waited for rafeal and arschmitz for too long.
[09:19:48] <fnagel> yes
[09:20:03] <arschmitz> sorry i missed the doodle
[09:20:04] <fnagel> Another round?
[09:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, send another one.
[09:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping Rafael separately to make sure he responds.
[09:20:25] <arschmitz> ill fill it out asap i just never saw first one
[09:20:56] <fnagel> I'm moving next week, but I'll see what can be done
[09:21:19] <jzaefferer> I'll wait a bit to see if I can get a response here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1600#issuecomment-142652602 if there is none, I'll merge it as-is
[09:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today.
[09:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[09:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> See you back in -dev.
[10:01:34] <arthurvr> Hey everybody
[10:01:41] <agcolom> Hey, content team meeting!
[10:01:47] <agcolom> Hi everyone :-)
[10:01:49] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone!
[10:01:50] <arthurvr> `contentteam
[10:02:02] <arthurvr> should we set that up again?
[10:02:13] <agcolom> I think that would be good :-)
[10:02:18] <arthurvr> anyways, hi everyone!
[10:03:31] <agcolom> let's see who's around... kswedberg arschmitz ?
[10:03:40] <arschmitz> im here
[10:03:41] <kswedberg> oh hey agcolom
[10:03:47] <agcolom> hey Karl :-)
[10:03:50] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:04:01] <agcolom> Sorry not much on the agenda...
[10:04:14] <arthurvr> I don’t really have much eighter.
[10:04:22] <arthurvr> Not been that active of a week.
[10:04:48] <agcolom> I started landing stuff on the api.jquerymobile.com but I need help from arschmitz for cherry-picking
[10:04:55] <AurelioDeRosa> I didn't expect the issues + PRs count to be increased
[10:06:11] <agcolom> sorry had to get the door...
[10:06:47] <agcolom> great job though from you guys
[10:07:43] <AurelioDeRosa> When any of you have time, can you review this PR? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/806
[10:07:53] <AurelioDeRosa> It felt weird when I found out the page was completely missing
[10:08:47] <agcolom> Added to the agenda :-)
[10:10:06] <agcolom> I need to check how this is done elsewhere, but I wonder whether line 4 should use <code> </code> for contextmenu instead of " "?
[10:10:33] <agcolom> (I haven't checked how it's done elsewhere)
[10:11:11] <arthurvr> We don’t have strict rules and use both all over the place.
[10:11:33] <arthurvr> I always go for <code> tags but we’ve never been consistent
[10:11:36] <AurelioDeRosa> True, although I think we should use <code>
[10:11:38] <agcolom> oo :-(
[10:11:53] <agcolom> yes, I think <code> would be good...
[10:12:09] <arthurvr> that kind of things should perhaps go into the prose style guide (https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/75)
[10:12:15] <agcolom> Ok, let's all take a look at AurelioDeRosa's PR and add comments
[10:13:41] <AurelioDeRosa> @agcolom: As promised I also took care of the WP website. Not that I've done crazy stuff, but I've submitted 3-4 PRs
[10:13:58] <agcolom> That's great! Thank you AurelioDeRosa
[10:14:14] <agcolom> I've seen also that scott_gonzalez reviewed your jquery-wp-content PRs
[10:14:34] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, 2 of them have been already reviewed and merged.
[10:14:45] <AurelioDeRosa> I think there is one more standing
[10:15:02] <arthurvr> there’s still https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/374
[10:15:30] <arthurvr> Our CSS is such a mess, by the way
[10:15:49] <AurelioDeRosa> 100% agree.
[10:16:18] <AurelioDeRosa> I think that at the end of the day, the only solution is to create a complete new theme that replaces this one.
[10:16:56] <arthurvr> Our styles are mixed with third-party ones, it has no style at all and it’s not logical in many ways
[10:18:14] <arthurvr> Nobody is actively developing new design/sites atm so I don’t think it’s really worth spending much time on atm though.
[10:18:19] <arthurvr> As AurelioDeRosa said it’s probably only going to get cleaned up when when we ever totally write a new theme…
[10:18:42] <arthurvr> I mean, lolz this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/9f916acf4979f65350a048269977348981deefca
[10:18:59] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, that was a lovely finding :)
[10:19:36] <agcolom> indeed!
[10:19:43] <arthurvr> I wonder what whoever that wrote those background-image rules thought while writing those :P
[10:20:35] <agcolom> ok, I've added links to PRs that need reviewing
[10:20:45] <agcolom> any others in that category?
[10:21:17] <arthurvr> Don’t think so.
[10:21:38] <AurelioDeRosa> I think those are the main ones submitted by me but we have other people PRs to review
[10:21:39] <arthurvr> there are those api.jquerymobile.com PRs waiting for someone to merge
[10:22:13] <agcolom> Those that have the 1.5 milestone will only go in just before 1.5 is out
[10:22:21] <agcolom> I think is my understanding
[10:22:36] <arthurvr> Isn’t that what the branch is for?
[10:22:47] <arthurvr> like we do it on every other site?
[10:22:55] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/354#issuecomment-109601998
[10:23:31] <agcolom> ok, cool, I missed that
[10:23:55] <agcolom> I can mention it at the mobile meeting tomorrow if I can attend
[10:26:29] <agcolom> it's in the notes also now.
[10:27:15] <agcolom> so I'll try to take care of the mobile issues again, and speak with alex and gabriel about the 1-5 PRs that are ready to land
[10:28:03] <agcolom> Are all of issues from 9th Sept still ongoing?
[10:28:17] <agcolom> (just to add to the notes so we know)
[10:28:28] <arthurvr> yeah, just haven’t had much time lately
[10:29:05] <agcolom> no problem arthurvr. Thanks for everything you're doing!
[10:29:13] <agcolom> same with AurelioDeRosa :-)
[10:29:19] <kswedberg> +1
[10:29:24] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you :)
[10:29:29] <arthurvr> o/
[10:30:20] <agcolom> I don't have anything else either to discuss. New academic year means a lot more help with homework needed!
[10:30:31] <agcolom> (from me :-P )
[10:30:43] <kswedberg> :) ok, see ya around everyone
[10:30:48] <AurelioDeRosa> I think we discussed a few things, so we can wrap up.
[10:30:53] <arthurvr> Bye everyone.
[10:30:54] <AurelioDeRosa> See you all!
[10:31:01] <agcolom> cool. Thanks everyone!
[10:31:15] <AurelioDeRosa> Bye
