[11:02:27] <toddparker> Hi all
[11:02:39] <toddparker> the jQuery Mobile meeting is going to start now
[11:02:46] <toddparker> chime in if you're here
[11:03:38] <toddparker> meeting is not un-moderated
[11:03:41] <toddparker> sorry about that
[11:03:46] <agcolom> hi
[11:03:50] <JasonDScott> Hi
[11:03:54] <gseguin> hi
[11:03:56] <uGoMobi2> hi
[11:04:06] <johnbender> rawr
[11:04:24] <toddparker> hey all
[11:04:31] <toddparker> ok, let's jump in
[11:04:55] <toddparker> Device donation page by conference so we can announce - I'm working on that
[11:05:12] <toddparker> Roadmap for conference
[11:05:32] <toddparker> think this can be high level but will require some discussion so let's cover that in a breakout
[11:05:43] <toddparker> couple big things for the conference
[11:05:45] <toddparker> Site re-templating for the conference
[11:05:55] <toddparker> Richard wants to help get us set up on that
[11:06:14] <toddparker> Anne - do you have time tomorrow to meet with Richard and I?
[11:06:24] <agcolom> What time tomorrow?
[11:06:34] <toddparker> the plan is to port our existing content into the new template, then tidy up styles
[11:06:37] <agcolom> I could but it would have to be a bit later....
[11:06:42] <toddparker> what times work for you?
[11:06:44] <agcolom> say from 9pm for me
[11:06:51] <agcolom> 4pm for you
[11:06:54] <toddparker> ok, I'll ask Richard
[11:07:01] <agcolom> ok
[11:07:19] <agcolom> I have 4 widgets ready in hte api docs
[11:07:29] <toddparker> email sent
[11:07:39] <agcolom> dialog, collapsibles, collapsible sets and sliders
[11:07:41] <toddparker> great!
[11:07:50] <toddparker> re: embedded examples
[11:08:04] <agcolom> no embedded examples... had a nightmare with it...
[11:08:17] <toddparker> richard said we just need to tweak the XSLT to handle examples in the longdesc node
[11:08:33] <toddparker> maybe we can ask him tomorrow if we talk?
[11:08:33] <agcolom> I have not managed to add the data-role page
[11:08:42] <toddparker> hmm
[11:08:46] <agcolom> so I get the embedded example twice
[11:08:50] <toddparker> ok. hopefully he can help with that
[11:08:55] <agcolom> ok
[11:08:57] <toddparker> cool
[11:09:13] <toddparker> so for the conference, I do want to have 1.1.1 RC1 ready
[11:09:14] <agcolom> the problem is we have to add JQM to the page and all gets enhanced
[11:09:23] <toddparker> gotcha agcolom
[11:09:26] <toddparker> hmm
[11:09:36] <johnbender> toddparker: beta or RC?
[11:10:00] <toddparker> i think we were saying that we'd go right into RCs for maintenance releases
[11:10:12] <toddparker> since it's all bug fixes
[11:10:21] <toddparker> but we could do a beta instead
[11:10:28] <gseguin> yep I think that's what we agreed on
[11:10:49] <toddparker> i'd do a beta if we were unsure of some changes
[11:10:52] <johnbender> the only thing I'm thinking is that we haven't been using it and we've had issue sneak in from the cherry picking
[11:11:00] <toddparker> i see
[11:11:08] <johnbender> we pulled out some merge conflict markers the other day
[11:11:08] <toddparker> fine with doing a beta
[11:11:11] <toddparker> can't hurt
[11:11:15] <johnbender> it can be a super short one
[11:11:19] <toddparker> yeah
[11:11:23] <johnbender> it's just been a long time since anyone used stable
[11:11:26] <toddparker> week, then move into RC1
[11:11:26] <johnbender> ah!
[11:11:27] <toddparker> sure
[11:11:32] <toddparker> ?
[11:11:46] <johnbender> and maybe we can make stable our "master" for the week running up to it?
[11:11:55] <johnbender> so it gets more testing?
[11:11:58] <johnbender> just a thought
[11:12:00] <johnbender> might be overboard
[11:12:11] <toddparker> we could ask people to test via the branch preview
[11:12:21] <toddparker> and give them the links to the JS and CSS
[11:12:25] <toddparker> for that branch
[11:13:13] <toddparker> seems like an ok idea?
[11:13:31] <johnbender> sure
[11:13:36] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:13:49] <toddparker> we'll decide RC vs. beta before releasing
[11:14:12] <johnbender> yar
[11:14:13] <toddparker> key issues we should focus on nailing down this week
[11:14:18] <toddparker> listview click performance (Gabriel to land + benchmark?)
[11:14:34] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340#issuecomment-6198601
[11:14:45] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: i saw you had a comment on that
[11:15:42] <toddparker> ?
[11:15:49] <_|Nix|_> sec ...
[11:15:54] <toddparker> sounds like we it's ok to comment this out
[11:15:55] <toddparker> commented out the aforementioned "$( "." + $.mobile.activePageClass + " .ui-btn" ).not( link ).blur();" line and ran the unit tests. They all passed.
[11:16:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Mostly that I'm not sure I can run the performance tests - johnbender Gave me the tarball with the test stuff, and I got it to not have any errors, but all I'm getting is "[]"
[11:16:23] <toddparker> i'd like to land this change ASAP so we can see if there are edge cases our tests aren't seeing
[11:16:38] <toddparker> johnbender: can you help benchmark this with _|Nix|_
[11:16:43] <johnbender> sure
[11:16:44] <gseguin> I can confirm that we did that in an app here last year and had no noticeable change of behavior
[11:16:55] <toddparker> i want to know if this change gets us back to 1.0.1 perf
[11:17:01] <toddparker> +/-
[11:17:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... and I'm also getting pulled away to web-ui-fw work ...
[11:17:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we can also do it with jsper
[11:17:17] <johnbender> probably easier that way
[11:17:38] <toddparker> thanks johnbender, gseguin - sounds encouraging
[11:17:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... I'm mucking with that now ... it got stuck in FF saying "pending..." ...
[11:17:45] <toddparker> hrm
[11:17:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Doing it in Chrome now.
[11:18:11] <toddparker> if usit tests pass and it seems faster in testing, we can land it and benchmark later to see if we need to do more work on this
[11:18:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Some script error, but not in jqm - in some ui.js O_o
[11:18:17] <toddparker> great
[11:18:25] <toddparker> eh?
[11:18:48] <johnbender> sounds good
[11:19:02] <johnbender> I think we were planning to do a perf pass at some point anyhow
[11:19:51] <toddparker> cool
[11:19:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It'd be nice to have a setup for perf tests as easy as we have for unit tests ...
[11:19:54] <toddparker> ok, next
[11:20:05] <toddparker> flickering in uiWebView (phonegap)
[11:20:08] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4024
[11:20:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thats what I was saying earlier, we need that to do it right and keep it maintained
[11:20:22] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: saw that related PR
[11:20:25] <johnbender> I'll look into it
[11:20:26] <uGoMobi2> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4462
[11:20:27] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by alexksso (2w, 4d ago): slide flickering within a ios app webview (i.e. phonegap container)

[11:20:31] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by alexksso (2w, 4d ago): slide flickering within a ios app webview (i.e. phonegap container)
[11:20:38] <uGoMobi2> oops
[11:20:45] <toddparker> ?
[11:21:00] <uGoMobi2> i am not really familiar with phonegap
[11:21:06] <toddparker> ah
[11:21:10] <uGoMobi2> that user offered help
[11:21:14] <uGoMobi2> the one from the PR
[11:21:18] <toddparker> good tip for simulating phonegap
[11:21:28] <uGoMobi2> can you tell him in a comment what you need to test it
[11:21:45] <uGoMobi2> i saw in the thread at the issue that it does help
[11:21:56] <toddparker> go here
[11:21:56] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/config/index.html
[11:22:08] <toddparker> well, make the change locally
[11:22:15] <toddparker> then go to the con gif test page
[11:22:31] <toddparker> this one specifically
[11:22:32] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/config/iOSFullscreen.html
[11:22:40] <toddparker> save to your iOS homescreen
[11:22:49] <toddparker> open the link from the homescreen
[11:23:00] <uGoMobi2> well thats a problem since i dont have iOS
[11:23:08] <toddparker> this is now a web view and i've been able to reproduce PG issues there
[11:23:10] <toddparker> ah, i see
[11:23:15] <toddparker> we can test then
[11:23:18] <toddparker> no worries
[11:23:22] <uGoMobi2> yup :-)
[11:23:24] <toddparker> i'll test
[11:23:28] <uGoMobi2> ok cool
[11:24:15] <toddparker> unless anyone here has iOS and the time to test this PR
[11:24:47] <johnbender> I have a simulator
[11:24:53] <johnbender> I can give it a whirl
[11:25:02] <toddparker> it's ok, i'll test on real devices
[11:25:07] <toddparker> INTERN TASK
[11:25:13] <uGoMobi2> FWIW - i can't think of a downside of that change (setting and removing z-index)
[11:25:15] <johnbender> lawl
[11:25:24] <toddparker> seems safe, yes
[11:25:34] <toddparker> just want to see if it works
[11:25:50] <uGoMobi2> yes
[11:25:51] <toddparker> ok, next
[11:25:53] <toddparker> update page padding (Jasper)
[11:26:00] <toddparker> http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjquery%2Fjquery-mobile%2Fissues%3Flabels%3DupdatePagePadding%26milestone%3D14%26page%3D1%26state%3Dopen&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFgX4awZJj7pocAUhC9KIOvr8rWNg
[11:26:01] <uGoMobi2> see my update in the agenda
[11:26:45] <toddparker> ok, so you need testing help
[11:26:56] <toddparker> updatePagePadding
[11:26:57] <toddparker> fixed 1 issue about shifting headers during transition
[11:26:58] <toddparker> working on fix for issue about the default padding in structure css
[11:27:00] <toddparker> about to close #4223 about setting uPP to false - see my comment there
[11:27:01] <toddparker> 3 other issues might be fixed by PR from MauriceG
[11:27:02] <toddparker> land PR (need test results from Todd before merge)
[11:27:03] <toddparker> have people testing again to see if there are still issues
[11:27:16] <toddparker> what's the PR from maurgiceG? link?
[11:27:32] <uGoMobi2> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4260
[11:27:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1m, 1w ago): Suggestion: Fix for fixed persistent toolbar padding issues
[11:28:53] <toddparker> ok, so you need us to test on our devices then?
[11:29:00] <uGoMobi2> needs to be tested on iOS
[11:29:08] <uGoMobi2> yes
[11:29:18] <toddparker> seems like this needs unit test help too?
[11:29:33] <toddparker> johnbender: you were on that thread
[11:29:44] <uGoMobi2> how can i run unit test on a patch in a PR?
[11:29:46] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: can we just test that jsfiddle?
[11:30:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi2: click the circle i button the left side of the green bar
[11:30:07] <johnbender> follow the steps
[11:30:10] <uGoMobi2> yes - it loads the adjusted JS
[11:30:23] <johnbender> and that will create a new branch with the patches applied
[11:30:26] <johnbender> you can then add a test or two
[11:30:30] <johnbender> maybe rebase
[11:30:34] <johnbender> and then merge back into master
[11:30:46] <uGoMobi2> johnbender: ok thanks
[11:30:50] <johnbender> if you need to then get it into stable you'll have to cherry pick many commits
[11:30:52] <uGoMobi2> even when it's a gray button?
[11:31:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi2: especially when it's grey :D
[11:31:09] <johnbender> that means there are merge conflicts
[11:31:22] <uGoMobi2> yes I understand, but I mean does it work same way
[11:31:27] <toddparker> johnbender: does the gray button mean merge conflicts ahead?
[11:31:33] <uGoMobi2> will look into it and otherwise ask after meeting
[11:31:46] <johnbender> no
[11:31:51] <johnbender> toddparker: well
[11:31:52] <johnbender> it checks
[11:31:55] <toddparker> so i can tell the intern to test: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/jVKyS/
[11:31:56] <toddparker> anyone know how to view a jsfiddle with no chrome
[11:31:58] <johnbender> I think it does a  dry run to look for them
[11:32:04] <johnbender> it's one of the merge options
[11:32:13] <toddparker> johnbender: no?
[11:32:21] <uGoMobi2> toddparker: yes (just add "show" add and of the link)
[11:32:26] <toddparker> show!
[11:32:52] <uGoMobi2> end*
[11:33:00] <agcolom> http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/jVKyS/show/
[11:33:34] <johnbender> toddparker: ah sorry I misread your question
[11:33:48] <johnbender> yes it means it can't automerge because of conflicts or some other issue
[11:33:55] <johnbender> I'm not 100% on what the criteria is
[11:33:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: fiddle.jshell.net/dVrKS/4/show/light/
[11:34:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Of course, replace the right parts.
[11:34:59] <toddparker> ok, we'll test that
[11:35:24] <uGoMobi2> toddparker: as soon as it is tested I get back to the people who opened those issues
[11:35:32] <toddparker> ok, last issue i saw that needed attention
[11:35:36] <toddparker> will do uGoMobi2
[11:35:38] <toddparker> unable to close dialog in webview (Bender)
[11:35:47] <toddparker> http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjquery%2Fjquery-mobile%2Fissues%2F2190&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFPOqbnb70qe1LKszvqJQX8MV9e2A
[11:35:58] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2190
[11:36:34] <johnbender> I can take a look at that one
[11:36:37] <johnbender> fegging weird though
[11:36:46] <johnbender> I might even still have the project lying around
[11:36:49] <toddparker> yea dude
[11:37:23] <toddparker> ok, anything else we really need to land for 1.1.1?
[11:37:38] <uGoMobi2> IE submit button issue
[11:37:41] <uGoMobi2> ?
[11:37:51] <toddparker> link?
[11:38:33] <uGoMobi2> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4413
[11:38:49] <uGoMobi2> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2743
[11:39:08] <toddparker> ah, yes
[11:39:09] <toddparker> fun
[11:39:15] <toddparker> be good to fix that too
[11:39:17] <uGoMobi2> :-)
[11:39:32] <toddparker> ok, on the hot list
[11:39:38] <uGoMobi2> moving on to that one while uPP is being tested
[11:39:45] <toddparker> ok
[11:40:04] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: can you send me a summary email with issue and test links for anything you need us to look at?
[11:40:15] <toddparker> i can have Zach crank thru that today
[11:40:26] <uGoMobi2> toddparker: ok no problem
[11:40:26] <toddparker> just don't want to hold you up waiting for us
[11:40:28] <toddparker> cool
[11:40:46] <toddparker> so for 1.2, i'd like to have an alpha so we can get people playing with the popup
[11:40:51] <toddparker> seems pretty solid
[11:40:58] <toddparker> this new issue I logged
[11:41:00] <toddparker> positioning - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4519
[11:41:11] <gseguin> We're already using it in prod
[11:41:15] <toddparker> seems like we could refine positioning a bit - _|Nix|_
[11:41:21] <toddparker> yeah gseguin?
[11:41:27] <toddparker> have you run into any issues?
[11:41:28] <gseguin> backported it for use with 1.1
[11:41:33] <toddparker> cool
[11:41:34] <gseguin> not really
[11:41:40] <toddparker> good to hear!
[11:42:04] <agcolom> same here
[11:42:05] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:42:11] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: I'd like your opinion on how we should handle padding rules
[11:42:14] <johnbender> Jicing
[11:42:16] <johnbender> Jiving
[11:42:28] <uGoMobi2> ok
[11:42:40] <toddparker> right now, i'm adding the content padding (15px) but it's too much when combined with a  Heading or <p>
[11:42:58] <uGoMobi2> yes
[11:43:01] <toddparker> so i just want to think about some good defaults for styles
[11:43:13] <uGoMobi2> and when it's an image or map etc we dont want padding at all
[11:43:25] <toddparker> right, by default popups have no padding
[11:43:32] <toddparker> if you want  padding, add a class
[11:43:39] <toddparker> i'm using ui-content
[11:43:45] <toddparker> which may be fine
[11:43:47] <uGoMobi2> ok same as ui-bar
[11:43:57] <uGoMobi2> same idea i mean
[11:44:03] <toddparker> but we may want to tweak some defaults if that's used within a popup
[11:44:08] <toddparker> yeah
[11:44:22] <toddparker> maybe we use 10px by default instead of 15
[11:44:29] <toddparker> for pudding on the container
[11:44:38] <toddparker> it gets wonky when you add just a p inside
[11:44:43] <toddparker> too much vertical space then
[11:44:54] <toddparker> padding on parent + margin on p
[11:45:00] <toddparker> same with a heading
[11:45:00] <uGoMobi2> right
[11:45:13] <toddparker> so it's sort of a scoping exercise
[11:45:29] <toddparker> if it's the first p or h, don't add margin maybe?
[11:45:39] <toddparker> not sure
[11:45:51] <uGoMobi2> have to look at it
[11:45:55] <uGoMobi2> not sure either
[11:46:05] <toddparker> or does this class just add left/right padding and no top/bottom
[11:46:06] <uGoMobi2> will do after uPP and IE buttons for 1.1.1
[11:46:09] <toddparker> rely on margin for that
[11:46:21] <toddparker> will collapse if you just add test inside the popup div then
[11:46:29] <toddparker> some of this si a docs question too
[11:46:31] <toddparker> cool
[11:46:37] <toddparker> happy to work with you on it
[11:46:56] <uGoMobi2> cool
[11:46:56] <toddparker> any other issues with popup we' deed to fix before showing it off publically
[11:47:00] <toddparker> as an alpha
[11:47:08] <toddparker> we can keep fixing later
[11:47:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I can't think of any, but testing the tab navigation would be good.
[11:47:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Also, open one popup from another.
[11:47:45] <toddparker> ok, sure
[11:47:50] <toddparker> seems to be working but yeah
[11:47:58] <uGoMobi2> same for selectmenu accesibility inside popup
[11:48:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I've had this flashing issue where it looks like the page briefly scrolls to 0 before scrolling back to where it was.
[11:48:12] <toddparker> in FF?
[11:48:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The flashing was confined to Chrome, AFAICT.
[11:48:40] <toddparker> hmm
[11:48:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi2: Yeah, the multiselect is still broken.
[11:48:45] <toddparker> i'll test that
[11:48:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'm not seing it anymore, but who knows.
[11:49:10] <toddparker> anyone know why the jQM logo here keeps poplin cup as a broken image
[11:49:11] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[11:49:14] <toddparker> random
[11:49:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The root of the issue is that the browser doesn't tell you where the focus will go, giving you a chance to stop it from going there with a .preventDefault() ...
[11:49:27] <toddparker> will look ok, but is broken sometime on back butt on or nav home
[11:49:31] <toddparker> new regression
[11:49:36] <agcolom> I've had that too... gets fixed when you reload the page...
[11:49:39] <uGoMobi2> yeah i noticed that too
[11:49:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You've been having some random broken image problems recently ...
[11:50:01] <johnbender> I can't get it to happen here
[11:50:08] <toddparker> odd
[11:50:13] <toddparker> maybe why i saw the broken photo last night too
[11:50:15] <toddparker> hrm
[11:50:15] <agcolom> more recently, it's been the logo, before it was the version banner
[11:50:22] <toddparker> yeah, right agcolom
[11:50:33] <toddparker> ghosts in the machine
[11:50:49] <agcolom> happens when the page has been up for a very long time...
[11:50:51] <uGoMobi2> can it be a server issue?
[11:51:00] <toddparker> maybe
[11:51:02] <uGoMobi2> JQM becomming too popular :-)
[11:51:04] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: other updates
[11:51:25] <toddparker> think we covered your 2 items
[11:51:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Nothing major - just the popup tab nav, and the buttonMarkup stuff, but that's going for 1.2 now, as you've milestoned it.
[11:51:53] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:51:55] <toddparker> gseguin: your update list can drop in here :)
[11:52:31] <toddparker> Ghislain
[11:52:32] <toddparker> kinda stuck in the code re-org because of the depend! plugin:
[11:52:33] <toddparker> going to attempt moving the depend plugin
[11:52:34] <toddparker> or upgrade to RequireJS 2.0
[11:52:34] <agcolom> looks like it's there, no?
[11:52:39] <toddparker> yep
[11:52:48] <toddparker> re: download builder
[11:53:00] <toddparker> i'm tempted to tweet that URL to get more activity
[11:53:13] <toddparker> or we can wait til the conference
[11:53:24] <toddparker> gseguin: have you been using this internally?
[11:53:37] <toddparker> anyone used the builder for testing
[11:53:39] <gseguin> yeah I built a custom build
[11:53:49] <gseguin> and used it in our app
[11:54:07] <toddparker> maybe i'll announce at the confercne
[11:54:11] <gseguin> that worked besides one ui glitch which I'm sure is not really due to jqm
[11:54:14] <toddparker> don't want to spoilt he surprise
[11:54:50] <toddparker> ok
[11:55:09] <gseguin> yeah I was thinking you could keep it as a "there is one more thing"
[11:55:10] <toddparker> gseguin: are you in a holding pattern now
[11:55:13] <toddparker> heh
[11:55:15] <toddparker> yeah
[11:55:37] <toddparker> bender - your updates?
[11:55:44] <gseguin> kinda, I mean I would love to finish reorganizing the code
[11:55:51] <johnbender> grunt-junit is working for the ui folks
[11:55:52] <toddparker> yeah
[11:55:56] <toddparker> woo hoo
[11:55:57] <johnbender> new readme is in
[11:56:00] <toddparker> BOOM
[11:56:07] <johnbender> please have a look and use the anchors as links
[11:56:12] <johnbender> issues and pr info are at the top
[11:56:15] <gseguin> but I think I hit a bug in RequireJS and I doubt it's going to get fixed
[11:56:18] <toddparker> cool
[11:56:21] <toddparker> didn't know that landed
[11:56:24] <johnbender> linting is almost finished
[11:56:28] <gseguin> so the solution would be to upgrade to 2.0
[11:56:31] <johnbender> the support module is the last offender
[11:56:36] <gseguin> will try it out
[11:56:39] <johnbender> and I'm scared to change the crazy shit that's in there
[11:56:47] <uGoMobi2> lol
[11:56:49] <johnbender> toddparker: can you have Scott runt the linting on master
[11:56:56] <johnbender> there are some bizarre things
[11:57:00] <toddparker> scott G or J?
[11:57:03] <johnbender> while loop with no block
[11:57:03] <johnbender> J
[11:57:16] <toddparker> that was his code?
[11:57:18] <johnbender> it's totes crazytown
[11:57:28] <johnbender> no he cargo culted it from someone for an ie version test
[11:57:33] <johnbender> inserts conditioncal comments
[11:57:45] <toddparker> ah DAMMIT PAUL IRISH
[11:57:47] * johnbender grumbles about overly clever code
[11:57:55] <johnbender> anyway
[11:57:59] <toddparker> sometime you gotta bend the rules
[11:58:02] <johnbender> once that gets sorted I'm adding to the build
[11:58:09] <johnbender> so if you forget a semi YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED
[11:58:32] <johnbender> since all of your editors are incapable of alerting you to things like that before hand
[11:58:35] * johnbender coughs
[11:58:40] <johnbender> emacs js2-mode
[11:58:43] * johnbender coughs
[11:58:46] <gseguin> can we customize the notification message to: "DAMMIT, <username>!"?
[11:58:53] <paul_irish> whatd i do?
[11:58:57] <toddparker> heh
[11:59:02] <johnbender> it's actually someone else
[11:59:02] <toddparker> sorry paul, wrongly accused
[11:59:20] <johnbender> one James Padolsey
[11:59:24] <toddparker> exactly
[11:59:31] <toddparker> was hunting for the details
[11:59:50] <johnbender> while ( div.innerHTML = "<!--[if gt IE " + ( ++v ) + "]><br><![endif]-->", a[ 0 ] ){};
[11:59:53] * johnbender falls out of his chair
[11:59:55] <paul_irish> love that line.
[11:59:55] <toddparker> paul_irish is everywhere
[12:00:12] <paul_irish> live nodelists
[12:00:16] <toddparker> sweet, sweet genius
[12:00:16] <toddparker> looks good to me
[12:00:16] <paul_irish> oh yes.
[12:00:41] <johnbender> the linter is not happy
[12:00:47] <toddparker> boo hoo
[12:00:52] <johnbender> and I don't think they make linting rules for that
[12:00:56] <johnbender> lol
[12:00:58] <johnbender> well the ydo
[12:00:59] <toddparker> er...nope
[12:01:06] <johnbender> but it breaks the linter something like 10 times
[12:01:13] <toddparker> can we just tell it "here be monsters"
[12:01:20] <johnbender> maybe
[12:01:34] <Wilto> I won’t be satisfied until we’ve broken the linter 15 times.
[12:01:38] <johnbender> given the choice I'd rather use something sane that I actually understand
[12:01:49] <toddparker> we could probably add those brackets
[12:02:13] <toddparker> before we run out of time
[12:02:15] <toddparker> agcolom:
[12:02:26] <toddparker> i know you chimed in areasy on docs (yay)
[12:02:34] <agcolom> yep
[12:02:35] <toddparker> and we'll connect on the site re-design
[12:02:38] <gseguin> johnbender: is it complaining because of the empty {} ?
[12:02:40] <paul_irish> that line should be possible to adapt to pass the linter with flying colors
[12:02:52] <agcolom> Richard is ok for 4pm your time tomorrow
[12:02:57] <toddparker> cool, perfect
[12:03:02] <johnbender> gseguin: nope, that was added in to avoid a closure compiler issue
[12:03:11] <johnbender> paul_irish: indeed!
[12:03:13] <gseguin> ok
[12:03:36] <agcolom> so all is here:     a few commits for docs (minor corrections/corrections)
[12:03:36] <agcolom>     14 new articles on the resources page
[12:03:36] <agcolom>     worked on api resource site:
[12:03:37] <agcolom>         dialog, collapsibles, collapsible sets complete (basic info). More info can be added. Will complete by the end of the week
[12:03:37] <agcolom>         slider: complete with full info
[12:03:37] <agcolom>         modified the XSL file to display all methods/events/options
[12:03:37] <agcolom>         modified XSL file to display the correct example base code
[12:03:52] <toddparker> nice agcolom
[12:04:05] <toddparker> still making process on issue counts too
[12:04:07] <johnbender> which is why I was hoping scott would look at it since I'm under the impression it was he who added it
[12:04:14] <toddparker> JasonDScott: how goes?
[12:05:00] <JasonDScott> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4001
[12:05:00] <JasonDScott> Added Docs page (currently open pull request https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4517) for work around to
[12:05:00] <JasonDScott> Searching for possible pseudo css we could use to target BB 7.1 with this fix
[12:05:00] <JasonDScott> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2159
[12:05:00] <JasonDScott> Helping Jasper test on BB5 Devices
[12:06:01] <uGoMobi2> JasonDScott: just saw you comment that navbar/grid is fixed on all BB5 devices :-)
[12:06:14] <toddparker> woo hoo
[12:06:21] <toddparker> awesome work uGoMobi2
[12:06:31] <uGoMobi2> will ask Todd in email to test few others so we can land it
[12:06:33] <paul_irish> picture is unrelated: http://paulirish.com/i/9a55b0.png
[12:06:50] <toddparker> BOO
[12:07:01] <toddparker> IE8 FTW
[12:07:10] <paul_irish> atta boy
[12:07:10] <toddparker> great
[12:07:34] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: re: your other proposals, can we discuss next week?
[12:07:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Sure!
[12:07:54] <johnbender> paul_irish: lawl at ie10 beating safari/ff
[12:07:59] <johnbender> oh how times have changed
[12:08:11] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... FF seems kinda slow ...
[12:08:19] <toddparker> kinda? sheesh.
[12:08:29] <Wilto> I only use Camino, me.
[12:08:32] <toddparker> I <3 Chrome
[12:08:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah but they've done some interesting research on type inference based performance improvements
[12:08:45] <johnbender> TYPES
[12:08:50] <johnbender> you need them even when you don't want them
[12:09:04] * johnbender laughs maniacally
[12:09:13] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:10:00] <johnbender> toddparker: one quick question for the CSS folks
[12:10:11] <johnbender> we can add in a CSS lint to the build too
[12:10:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We were just talking about that the other day - how they run things a couple of times interpreted, and then they compile it because they see that it always gets the same type of value - or something like that ... or maybe that's another optimization.
[12:10:13] <johnbender> do you guys want that
[12:10:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yep, the interesting stuff is in the details
[12:10:32] <johnbender> type barriers
[12:10:34] <toddparker> ok...
[12:10:34] <johnbender> confidence levels
[12:10:34] <johnbender> etc
[12:10:43] <johnbender> toddparker: yes you want it?
[12:10:53] <johnbender> there's likely to be some work involved in getting it to pass initially
[12:11:17] <uGoMobi2> already started cleaning up
[12:11:25] <johnbender> noice
[12:11:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sometimes I picture those developers suspended in a glass box filled with orange smoke.
[12:11:28] <toddparker> i was saying "ok" to johnbender asking a CSS Q
[12:11:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I've read all of those books
[12:11:41] <johnbender> toddparker: cool
[12:11:46] <johnbender> your elipses confused me
[12:11:52] * johnbender hates ambigous elipses
[12:11:57] <johnbender> :D
[12:11:59] <Wilto> Or…
[12:12:04] <Wilto> …do you?
[12:12:13] <johnbender> I've been scared by mean bosses
[12:12:21] <johnbender> ending everything that way
[12:12:23] <toddparker> you're FIRED
[12:12:25] <Wilto> I HEAR THAT.
[12:12:34] <uGoMobi2> toddparker: one more Q from me... can you look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4303
[12:12:34] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (1m, 1w ago): Disabled browser default outline for listview buttons on focus
[12:12:37] <johnbender> we need this work done soon ....
[12:12:52] <uGoMobi2> i want to get rid of default browser outline on focus
[12:12:53] <johnbender> .
[12:12:54] <johnbender> .
[12:12:54] <johnbender> .
[12:13:41] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: I agree we should nix the focus and add our shadow class for consistency
[12:13:45] <Wilto> “…” = “or you’re fired.” I mean, I mentally end everything toddparker says with “or you’re fired” anyway, really. Dude is a _tyrant_.
[12:13:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi2: It's kinda hard to see which item is highlighted. Try navigating the multi-level menu on the popup page with only the Tab key.
[12:13:56] <uGoMobi2> box-shadow is there already
[12:14:18] <johnbender> are we going to discuss the roadmap on a hangout?
[12:14:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi2: It's hard to see which item is focused in Chrome. FF adds the antsy outline and that's nice in that case.
[12:14:51] <uGoMobi2> _|Nix|_: I agree that we should improve the ui-focus box-shadow
[12:15:00] <toddparker> uGoMobi2: can you put together a demo page illustrating the issue and proposed solution? sorry, being thick
[12:15:13] <toddparker> i'm all for improving the tab focus style for clarity
[12:15:23] <uGoMobi2> same here
[12:15:37] <uGoMobi2> sure will create test page
[12:15:54] <uGoMobi2> i even see a flash of outline when i click select menu on chrome
[12:16:04] <toddparker> fun
[12:16:05] <toddparker> johnbender: did you ask your Q?
[12:16:17] <uGoMobi2> the fix is in that PR but will put it all together
[12:16:20] <johnbender> toddparker: only thing left I have is my perf/roadmap question
[12:16:29] <toddparker> ah
[12:16:36] <toddparker> i think we need to discuss both
[12:16:49] <toddparker> maybe we can chat tomorrow on IRC
[12:16:52] <toddparker> i have a meeting in a few
[12:16:54] <toddparker> boo
[12:16:56] <johnbender> kk
[12:17:04] <toddparker> ok all
[12:17:08] <johnbender> community input?
[12:17:17] <toddparker> thanks johnbender
[12:17:27] <toddparker> anyone in the community have questions for the team?
[12:17:31] <johnbender> ^^^^
[12:17:34] <johnbender> ^^^^
[12:17:44] <toddparker> bueller?
[12:17:47] <toddparker> ...
[12:17:51] <toddparker> bueller?
[12:17:53] <toddparker> ...
[12:17:54] <johnbender> lol
[12:18:04] <johnbender> two movie/book refs in one meeting
[12:18:08] <johnbender> totally out of hand
[12:18:08] <_|Nix|_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/bad-list-item-focus.avi
[12:18:11] <toddparker> we're doing well
[12:18:17] * johnbender flies away
[12:18:42] <Wilto> I’m out. http://wil.to/_/rap-music.png
[12:18:48] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: i can never open your videos, sorry
[12:18:51] <toddparker> get a mac!
[12:19:04] <_|Nix|_> It's MPEG4 inside an AVI - get mplayer.
[12:19:04] <toddparker> alright since we don't have any questions, we'll sign of
[12:19:06] <toddparker> off
[12:19:12] <toddparker> hrm
[12:19:12] <toddparker> ok
[12:19:14] <_|Nix|_> L8R all
[12:19:19] <uGoMobi2> later
[12:19:21] <agcolom> later
[12:19:23] <toddparker> thanks all!
