[09:33:37] <jzaefferer> Oh yeah, totally forgot about that UI meeting
[09:33:42] <jzaefferer> As Scott's not here...
[09:34:00] <jzaefferer> clarkbox gnarf kborchers - anyone around?
[09:34:13] <jzaefferer> danheberden?
[09:34:48] <kborchers> jzaefferer: not really ... lurking but have a deadline today on a UI mockup so pretty busy
[09:35:17] * kborchers has a real job now :)
[09:35:23] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:35:25] <gnarf> i just got up
[09:35:32] <jzaefferer> Yeah, its kind of obvious by now :p
[09:35:41] <jzaefferer> Hey Corey, haven't seen you in a while :-)
[09:35:44] <gnarf> kborchers: where?
[09:35:55] <kborchers> gnarf: Red Hat
[09:36:02] <gnarf> nice
[09:36:19] <kborchers> yeah, pretty sweet and working from home
[09:37:33] <jzaefferer> Well, there's one thing on the agenda for gnarf, same as it was for weeks
[09:37:47] <jzaefferer> Though the effects aren't the only swarm errors
[09:39:22] <jzaefferer> Well, everything else is already noted on the agenda, I don't have anything to add: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArIM4UVbwE-3dFg1T0k4VlE1bF82Nm9tbW90cVNxN0E#gid=13
[09:40:06] <jzaefferer> kborchers: you can land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/626 yourself, right?
[09:40:06] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (14h, 28m ago): Position: Fixed issue with offsets using the within option which caused flips to not happen when the containing element had been scrolled.
[09:40:52] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yep, as soon as i can get to it i'll get it in. is it breaking something important? have we been merging with 1-8-stable?
[09:41:40] <jzaefferer> kborchers: not important, no; just noticed that when I looked at the visual test
[09:41:54] <jzaefferer> also we don't land any of the new position features in 1-8-stable, so no need to merge that
[09:42:00] <jzaefferer> within is new in 1.9
[09:42:12] <kborchers> ok, speaking at a meetup tonight so if it's not too late when i get back i'll get it merged
[09:48:21] <jzaefferer> that's fine
