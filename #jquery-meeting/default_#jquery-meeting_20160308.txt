[14:00:49] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting Time!
[14:01:38] <thej> hey !
[14:01:52] <geekman-rohit> hey thej
[14:01:59] <geekman-rohit> hey sfrisk
[14:02:08] <sfrisk> kristjy, thej, geekman-rohit, arschmitz
[14:02:08] <thej> hi geekman-rohit !
[14:02:14] <kristyjy> hiya
[14:02:19] <sfrisk> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:02:44] <geekman-rohit> doc
[14:02:46] <geekman-rohit> nice
[14:03:03] <sfrisk> I figured this would make my life easier when I write up meeting notes
[14:03:08] <sfrisk> Copy paste ftw!
[14:03:18] <kristyjy> yay!
[14:03:43] <sfrisk> so up first is JSASS stuff, which arschmitz has been working on
[14:03:54] <thej> awesome
[14:03:58] <sfrisk> which would allow us to specify the order of css classes
[14:04:04] <arschmitz> yeah sorry i thought i would have it finished
[14:04:20] <arschmitz> it was going to be a simple 2 line change in chassis
[14:04:21] <sfrisk> No worries. We all have lives. But I know you did do a bunch of work on it today
[14:04:29] <arschmitz> but then instead i wrote a new version of jsass
[14:04:37] <arschmitz> and a grunt plugin for jsass
[14:04:47] <arschmitz> so then we can use that instead of our own
[14:04:54] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, I can relate
[14:05:04] <arschmitz> all 3 things i think are done
[14:05:04] <geekman-rohit> and that does make things simple
[14:05:10] <arschmitz> just need to be published and tested
[14:06:24] <arschmitz> i wrote up better docs too which should help people trying to use it
[14:08:07] <sfrisk> that's something I love to hear
[14:08:10] <sfrisk> "I have written docs"
[14:08:17] <arschmitz> it already had docs
[14:08:22] <arschmitz> i just made them better
[14:09:02] <sfrisk> better docs are nice
[14:09:10] <sfrisk> Okay, so expect that finished sometime soon
[14:09:13] <sfrisk> I assume
[14:09:16] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[14:09:21] <sfrisk> awesome
[14:09:29] <sfrisk> Next up is Buttons PR
[14:09:40] <sfrisk> I updated it so the disabled cursor is a variable and is currently set to not-allowed
[14:09:42] <arschmitz> which is what iv been using to test lol
[14:09:52] <sfrisk> haha, nice
[14:10:07] <sfrisk> I think the cursor was the last thing people had notes on, if so I'll pull that in today
[14:14:50] <sfrisk> yes?
[14:14:51] <sfrisk> no?
[14:14:52] <sfrisk> maybe so?
[14:15:02] <arschmitz> last thing i see commented on
[14:18:43] <sfrisk> ok
[14:21:34] <sfrisk> hrm, I don't think I'm seeing your last comment, arschmitz
[14:22:06] <sfrisk> just the note on avoiding cascading
[14:23:14] <arschmitz> no i was saying that the comment you mentioned was last i saw
[14:23:17] <arschmitz> not that i made one
[14:23:26] <arschmitz> sorry
[14:25:05] <sfrisk> ah okay
[14:25:33] <sfrisk> well if we think buttons are in a good place, I'll pull them in tonight then
[14:25:45] <sfrisk> also on a yay note - Typography is pulled in!!!
[14:26:43] <kristyjy> yay
[14:26:58] <thej> thats great to hear
[14:31:12] <sfrisk> also there is a pr open for the basic paragraphs and list styling
[14:32:25] <sfrisk> Looks like there have been updates since we've commented
[14:35:05] <thej> sfrisk Don't have a visual demo right now. Will get back to it tonight
[14:35:15] <sfrisk> awesome
[14:37:12] <sfrisk> Also looks like thej also added a PR for sass unit testing
[14:37:32] <sfrisk> I know we had discussed the possibility of adding sass unit testing months ago, but I don't think we had super looked into it
[14:37:47] <arschmitz> we had an issue open for it
[14:37:49] <sfrisk> so I'll admit to being a bit unfamiliar with pure
[14:37:51] <arschmitz> talked about it a bunch
[14:37:56] <arschmitz> just never setteled on anything
[14:38:08] <sfrisk> yeah I remember having discussions
[14:38:12] <arschmitz> pure was one of the ones we look at think i may have even posted it
[14:38:18] <sfrisk> ok
[14:38:31] <arschmitz> i think it died of mostly for 2 reasons
[14:38:36] <arschmitz> 1 we had nothing to test
[14:39:07] <arschmitz> 2 we were unsure of how much value it added in our case
[14:39:23] <geekman-rohit> im still doubtful about 2
[14:39:24] <arschmitz> since it only tests your logic and we are unlikely to have much logic in the scss
[14:39:43] <geekman-rohit> there will rarely be functions/mixins we need unit testing for
[14:39:54] <geekman-rohit> however that front end testing we wanted
[14:40:03] <geekman-rohit> rendeing/ rerendering time etc.
[14:40:07] <arschmitz> yes
[14:40:07] <geekman-rohit> that could really help
[14:40:11] <arschmitz> thats very different
[14:40:22] <arschmitz> we also talked about visual regression testing
[14:40:36] <sfrisk> which is also outside of sass unit tests
[14:40:43] <arschmitz> im all for unit testing if we have something worth testing
[14:40:48] <arschmitz> sfrisk: for sure
[14:40:51] <geekman-rohit> we could keep the pr open
[14:40:55] <geekman-rohit> for now
[14:41:06] <sfrisk> figure out how it could possible best work with the project?
[14:41:09] <arschmitz> a lot of this sort of logic may also end up in our jsass files
[14:41:11] <geekman-rohit> yes
[14:41:24] <geekman-rohit> we see how our mixins grow once we have buttons in
[14:41:27] <geekman-rohit> and forms
[14:41:36] <geekman-rohit> and then decide if we need unit testing
[14:41:37] <geekman-rohit> I doubt that still
[14:42:00] <arschmitz> if we add much logic into our var files we could add regular js unit testing to them
[14:42:12] <geekman-rohit> yes that I agree to
[14:42:31] <geekman-rohit> but will we have much logic?
[14:42:48] <geekman-rohit> we have tooo too many variables already coming up
[14:42:54] <geekman-rohit> almost everything is a variable
[14:43:15] <geekman-rohit> in time we will need some logic to make it.. easier to handle
[14:43:59] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:44:05] <sfrisk> agreed
[14:44:07] <arschmitz> i mean i cant predict the future lol
[14:44:11] <sfrisk> also to make sure we don't have unused variables
[14:44:16] <arschmitz> but if we see much logic it should be tested
[14:44:23] <thej> true
[14:44:28] <sfrisk> I accidentally noticed today I had an unused variable in buttons
[14:44:32] <arschmitz> that goes for the jsass and the scss
[14:44:45] <arschmitz> we could make a test for that
[14:44:51] <arschmitz> might be a little weird but we could do it
[14:48:32] <thej> arschmitz can't we use the grunt-mocha plugin to run our pure tests ?
[14:48:51] <arschmitz> thej: im not sure but i dont think thats really an issue this moment
[14:49:10] <arschmitz> i have not looked a pure recently to know how it works
[14:49:20] <thej> arschmitz ok
[14:50:59] <sfrisk> do we know of any other projects actively using unit testing?
[14:51:04] <sfrisk> for sass
[14:51:14] <arschmitz> thej: you looked when you did this but didnt realy find any right?
[14:51:40] <thej> yes, none of the sass based frameworks are using any right now
[14:52:21] <arschmitz> i dont think thats a good reason for us not to i mean someone has to be first
[14:52:27] <arschmitz> none of them are using rendering tests either
[14:52:32] <geekman-rohit> yes but as you said
[14:52:36] <geekman-rohit> if there is enough to test
[14:52:38] <geekman-rohit> we should
[14:52:40] <arschmitz> its all about if we have enough to test
[14:52:43] <arschmitz> exactly
[14:52:44] <geekman-rohit> when there is enough to test
[14:53:08] <sfrisk> so bench testing stuff for now until we hit enough of the phase one items?
[14:53:18] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: even if we only had 2 or 3 things right now
[14:53:21] <geekman-rohit> sounds good to me
[14:53:27] <geekman-rohit> agreed arschmitz
[14:53:31] <arschmitz> id be good with it because that means more will come
[14:53:40] <geekman-rohit> but right now I cannot see anything that might come except em
[14:53:46] <arschmitz> and id rather see it added early so we add tests as we go
[14:53:48] <geekman-rohit> that will require unit testing
[14:53:55] <arschmitz> not go back and try to write them after
[14:54:03] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[14:54:11] <geekman-rohit> but atleast one more thing to test
[14:54:21] <arschmitz> thej: can you look at the current lib and pending pr's and see if you can find anywhere you would use it
[14:54:26] <arschmitz> and write some example tests
[14:54:34] <thej> arschmitz sure, will be on it
[14:54:43] <arschmitz> so we can get a better idea of this
[14:54:47] <arschmitz> and how pure works
[14:55:22] <arschmitz> i think that wouldbe helpful for us looking at this
[14:55:28] <arschmitz> and if its needed
[14:55:54] <geekman-rohit> thats a good idea
[14:56:02] <geekman-rohit> we could look at some closed prs as wel
[14:56:05] <sfrisk> sounds good to me
[14:56:10] <geekman-rohit> table for instance
[14:56:11] <sfrisk> yeah, we need to close accessibility
[14:56:15] <geekman-rohit> marestads**
[14:56:16] <arschmitz> yeah i just want to see examples of what we would test
[14:56:21] <arschmitz> and what the tests look like
[14:56:21] <sfrisk> but that rebase/merge is painful
[14:56:31] <arschmitz> sfrisk: do you want me to do it
[14:56:32] <sfrisk> Kristyjy I think started that last night
[14:56:36] <sfrisk> pleaaase
[14:56:37] <arschmitz> i thought i offered before
[14:56:40] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:56:41] <arschmitz> but maybe just meant to
[14:56:42] <sfrisk> I was stubborn
[14:56:46] <arschmitz> no problem
[14:56:47] <sfrisk> and was all "oh, I'll do it"
[14:56:49] <arschmitz> i know the feeling
[14:56:52] <sfrisk> then I decided, no, stubborn is dumb
[14:56:57] <arschmitz> lol
[14:57:15] <sfrisk> it's basically before we changed how all the grunt tasks are laid out
[14:57:16] <arschmitz> no problem ill take care of that
[14:57:16] <sfrisk> soooo
[14:57:27] <arschmitz> yeah then probably easier for me anyway
[14:57:54] <sfrisk> yeah, I hadn't realized at the time until I started digging into it
[14:58:26] <kristyjy> sorry was waiting for you to ask and as soon as you do I get pulled away lol
[14:58:36] <sfrisk> that is the way it goes
[14:58:41] <kristyjy> I had to get the project set up again because I got a new computer
[14:58:51] <kristyjy> I ran into some issues trying to run grunt build
[14:59:14] <kristyjy> I thought I needed to build to actually run the project so I don't have anything to show for my efforts
[14:59:18] <arschmitz> kristyjy: you were looking at tables or accessability?
[14:59:22] <kristyjy> tables
[14:59:27] <arschmitz> ok
[14:59:59] <kristyjy> I'm going to try again tonight I should be able to actually get some work done now thanks to sfrisk
[15:00:00] <sfrisk> so todolist for this week!
[15:00:10] <sfrisk> kristyjy: tables
[15:00:19] <sfrisk> sfrisk: pull in buttons pr, finish up inputs
[15:00:28] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: meter? unless you want something else
[15:00:37] <sfrisk> arschmitz, jsass work, pull in accessibility
[15:00:43] <geekman-rohit> meter
[15:00:50] <geekman-rohit> unless there is something more important
[15:01:01] <sfrisk> thej: look into Pure, come up with some more test examples
[15:01:11] <sfrisk> everyone: review basic styles for paragraph and lists
[15:01:46] <thej> sfrisk can I work on alternate table styling too ? unless kristyjy is going to be working on it
[15:02:04] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy has started i think
[15:02:10] <geekman-rohit> thej we could help
[15:02:18] <geekman-rohit> I plan to help her with it
[15:02:26] <geekman-rohit> hop right in
[15:02:34] <thej> geekman-rohit sure, that's a plan, thanks !
[15:02:46] <sfrisk> we'll want kristy to get  a base styling in for review before touching alternate stuff
[15:03:01] <geekman-rohit> yep
[15:03:09] <thej> yeah, sure
[15:03:16] <geekman-rohit> and easy variables
[15:03:22] <kristyjy> yeah that would make it easier I imagine :)
[15:04:09] <thej> any updates on consistent outline styles #141 ?
[15:04:12] <geekman-rohit> kristyjy if you setup a pen or anything let me know
[15:04:36] <geekman-rohit> we dont do :none but we do something to make it look common across browsers
[15:04:48] <kristyjy> I will. That's a good idea actually I may do that
[15:04:50] <geekman-rohit> i think thats what we agreed upon?
[15:05:55] <arschmitz> so geekman-rohit mentioned we decided on a sort of jsass style guide if so it might be worth makeing a test for it
[15:06:00] <sfrisk> we could play with the outline stuff once we get the buttons committed
[15:06:16] <sfrisk> then we'll have a mix of <a> and buttons to test the outline styling with
[15:07:38] <sfrisk> okay, on that note
[15:07:42] <sfrisk> I need to get back to work
[15:07:48] <sfrisk> see everyone later!
