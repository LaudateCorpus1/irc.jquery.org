[11:01:17] <gseguin> Hi all, it's jQuery Mobile meeting time!
[11:01:20] <toddmparker> Hey gseguin - just saw you opened this. I was all fired up to -m
[11:01:30] <uGoMobi_> hi
[11:01:52] <gseguin> heh sorry toddmparker, I can +m it back if you'd like ;)
[11:02:11] <toddmparker> YES
[11:02:16] <toddmparker> sound off if you're here
[11:02:21] <johnbender> here
[11:02:29] <arschmitz> HERE!
[11:02:47] <uGoMobi_> rest of europe is on vacation I think
[11:02:58] <toddmparker> slackers
[11:03:01] <johnbender> that seems to happen at times in europe :)
[11:03:21] <toddmparker> no time off in 'merica
[11:03:32] <toddmparker> ok, let's do this
[11:03:36] <johnbender> word
[11:03:43] <toddmparker> first item is where we're at with 1.3.1
[11:03:53] <toddmparker> open issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=23&state=open
[11:04:09] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you said you made a branch with the 2 refresh fixes?
[11:04:15] <uGoMobi_> yes
[11:04:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: does the stable branch have the panels issue on ie?
[11:04:32] <uGoMobi_> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5854
[11:04:34] <b-ot> uGoMobi_: Pull request #5854 by uGoMobi (3h 34m ago): Table refresh method for 1.3.x. Fixes #5841 and fixes #5842.
[11:04:40] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: no
[11:04:43] <uGoMobi_> only master
[11:04:47] <toddmparker> whew
[11:04:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: cool
[11:05:11] <toddmparker> so how are the tests in that branch? we far off?
[11:05:20] <uGoMobi_> no, only one left
[11:05:21] <frequent> hey there
[11:05:24] <uGoMobi_> working on it
[11:05:27] <uGoMobi_> hey frequent
[11:05:47] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great!
[11:05:49] <frequent> uGoMobi: did you check start() in the one test? I think that's it. But I can't test from my tiny netbook here...
[11:06:01] <uGoMobi_> frequent: yeah, but that's not it
[11:06:12] <uGoMobi_> no worries
[11:06:14] <frequent> oik
[11:06:17] <uGoMobi_> I will update the test
[11:06:34] <toddmparker> great, so that should be in master later today
[11:06:38] <toddmparker> re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764
[11:06:38] <b-ot> toddmparker: Issue #5764 by Jelmeaux (3w 1d ago): Slide transition not working properly on iOS
[11:07:01] <uGoMobi_> iOS slide transition bug is fixed on Safari but still an issue on Chrome (I think we have to look in navigation.js)
[11:07:02] <uGoMobi_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764
[11:07:03] <b-ot> uGoMobi_: Issue #5764 by Jelmeaux (3w 1d ago): Slide transition not working properly on iOS
[11:07:03] <toddmparker> that was the slide transition we tested yesterday and it seemed ok on my iOS 6 and even 5
[11:07:13] <uGoMobi_> correct
[11:07:27] <uGoMobi_> Chrome is still a (different) issue though
[11:08:49] <uGoMobi_> if you test that same JS Bin on iOS Chrome you will see that pages slide over eachother
[11:09:12] <uGoMobi_> if you disable hashListening the issue is gone
[11:09:13] <toddmparker> I don't know if that's fixable. I'd rather kick that up to the Chrome guys
[11:10:26] <toddmparker> Let's talk about that after
[11:10:39] <uGoMobi_> it seems like it is a bug in iOS/Chrome but maybe we can do something to avoid it
[11:10:48] <uGoMobi_> yeah, we can discuss on -dev
[11:11:00] <toddmparker> the chrome guys asked for us to flag stuff for them to look at
[11:11:06] <toddmparker> seems perfect
[11:11:12] <uGoMobi_> :)
[11:11:12] <toddmparker> so 2 more issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5284
[11:11:14] <b-ot> toddmparker: Issue #5284 by rbu (4mon 2w ago): Navigating back is broken with autoInitializePage = false (Cannot call method 'trigger' of undefined)
[11:11:35] <toddmparker> this something we want to tackle today or should move out to 1.3.2
[11:12:43] <toddmparker> johnbender ^
[11:13:07] <toddmparker> anyone really :)
[11:13:28] <arschmitz> id have to dig in but looks simple enough
[11:14:01] <uGoMobi_> I haven't looked at that issue
[11:14:22] <toddmparker> do you have time to give this a look? not sure how critical this is. if it's not, i'd rather move it out
[11:14:24] <arschmitz> as long as there is something being over looked in issue the fix is provided and seems right
[11:14:39] <gseguin> if it's not crtical lets push it out
[11:15:00] <arschmitz> id say its probably an edge case
[11:15:22] <arschmitz> iv never actually seen autoinitialize false used before
[11:15:33] <frequent> I use it all the time
[11:15:56] <uGoMobi_> why did we decide to make it high priority and set milestone 1.3.1 last week?
[11:17:19] <toddmparker> exactly, not sure.
[11:17:30] <arschmitz> no idea this is honestly the first iv looked at it
[11:17:46] <toddmparker> moving to 1.3.2
[11:17:53] <toddmparker> ok, last issue: base tag stuff
[11:18:04] <johnbender> yah
[11:18:11] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3978
[11:18:12] <johnbender> the static base tag is ready to merge
[11:18:13] <b-ot> toddmparker: Issue #3978 by johnbender (11mon 4w ago): Base tag support issues
[11:18:22] <johnbender> but we need to live with it for a while
[11:18:27] <toddmparker> oh, great
[11:18:32] <toddmparker> so let's move to 1.3.2
[11:18:38] <johnbender> yah
[11:18:42] <gseguin> so we can release then ?
[11:18:43] <johnbender> toddmparker: it's a feature though
[11:18:46] <toddmparker> and push it to master now-ish
[11:18:52] <johnbender> we should probably fix 5284 eh?
[11:19:09] <toddmparker> johnbender: we were just talking about that
[11:19:27] <toddmparker> is it important enough and low risk enough and easy enough to try and do today
[11:19:29] <johnbender> I can take a look at the one if it's blocking us
[11:19:34] <toddmparker> or do we wait for 1.3.2
[11:19:42] <johnbender> I can take a look today
[11:19:47] <toddmparker> ok
[11:19:48] <johnbender> I'm going ot be in transit for lunch
[11:19:53] <johnbender> but I can look at it after that
[11:20:19] <toddmparker> ok, moved back to 1.3.1 and assigned to johnbender
[11:20:37] <toddmparker> it it ends up being hard/risky, we'll push it out
[11:21:03] <toddmparker> so once we land the refresh stuff and 5284, i'd like to do a deploy to test all that stuff
[11:21:18] <toddmparker> i know gseguin will want to see how that goes
[11:21:31] <gseguin> toddmparker: absolutely
[11:21:43] <toddmparker> if things look ok tonight, we could release tomorrow
[11:21:50] <gseguin> it'd be great if we can do that today
[11:21:56] <toddmparker> i'll be a conference mon/tue
[11:22:10] <toddmparker> but if we have to do it then, i can if the internet is ok
[11:22:47] <uGoMobi_> I think tomorrow should be fine
[11:22:48] <toddmparker> wed/thu uGoMobi, wilto and scottjehl and I will be jamming ontheming stuff
[11:22:54] <toddmparker> for 1.4
[11:23:08] <uGoMobi_> yeah :)
[11:23:17] <toddmparker> looking forward to it
[11:23:20] <uGoMobi_> me too
[11:23:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i'll check in after on what you've done so far
[11:23:53] <toddmparker> that's it for 1.3. seems like we're very close
[11:24:15] <toddmparker> for 1.4.0, i asked arschmitz to create a doc with widget standards and he did a great job on that
[11:24:16] <uGoMobi_> toddparker: I haven't pushed a branch yet, but can do that tomorrow
[11:24:25] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[11:24:35] <gseguin> toddmparker: I have hard stop at 1:00pm MDT
[11:24:40] <toddmparker> johnbender: you wanted to look at that list and prioritize
[11:24:46] <toddmparker> gseguin: ok
[11:25:44] <toddmparker> so what's the status of the download builder?
[11:26:01] <gseguin> I'm working on it
[11:26:01] <toddmparker> guess that's a blocker for 1.3.1
[11:26:13] <toddmparker> how broken?
[11:26:29] <gseguin> because we moved the requirejs plugins out of js/ it can't find them anymore
[11:26:35] <gseguin> and the fix is not trivial
[11:26:51] <gseguin> I'm hoping I can get a fix in by the end of the day
[11:26:59] <gseguin> but as usual I'm optimistic
[11:27:33] <toddmparker> yikes, ok
[11:27:52] <toddmparker> so tomorrow might be a long shot then
[11:28:16] <gseguin> if you consider the builder to be a blocker yes
[11:28:21] <toddmparker> i'd like to use some of this time to review that widget doc
[11:28:38] <toddmparker> but before that, anyone have anything they'd like to review/discuss?
[11:28:50] <johnbender> toddmparker: sorry reading back
[11:28:51] <toddmparker> figure we don't need to cover everything - it's in the doc
[11:29:03] <uGoMobi_> nope, nothing that hasn't been discusses yet
[11:29:39] <uGoMobi_> discussed*
[11:29:47] <johnbender> toddmparker: I think we should pick like the top 5 that people can aim for
[11:30:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: didn't check for a response from arschmitz on that suggestion
[11:30:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: just to be clear this is for internal use while writing and reviewing widgets
[11:30:47] <arschmitz> so personally i think it should include everything we want but be prioritized
[11:31:22] <toddmparker> right. but we should probably draw a line at the minimum things every widget must have that we can cover for 1.4
[11:31:27] <toddmparker> there are a lot of plugins
[11:31:43] <toddmparker> granted, some of this stuff if already in place too
[11:31:47] <arschmitz> yes which brings up something i wanted to mention
[11:32:17] <arschmitz> some of the things on here are more suggestions then punch list items
[11:32:27] <arschmitz> or things to look for
[11:32:37] <arschmitz> so maybe split it up
[11:32:52] <arschmitz> a set of general widget guidlines
[11:33:05] <arschmitz> performance stuff
[11:33:19] <arschmitz> and then a 5 or 10 item punch list
[11:33:23] <toddmparker> right. can be the same doc, but sections
[11:33:33] <uGoMobi_> +1
[11:33:52] <uGoMobi_> required + preferred
[11:33:59] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:34:04] <arschmitz> yeah i like that
[11:34:14] <arschmitz> and i think performance should be completely seperate
[11:34:17] <toddmparker> a lot of these are general guidelines which are good to keep in mind
[11:34:19] <arschmitz> thats not widget specific stuff
[11:34:33] <arschmitz> its just guidlines for effecient JS
[11:34:37] <uGoMobi_> I wouldn't mind if perfomance stays in same doc
[11:34:38] <toddmparker> but for #1
[11:34:44] <uGoMobi_> nice to have one checklist
[11:34:50] <toddmparker> +1 to one doc, just with headings
[11:34:54] <arschmitz> sure
[11:34:56] <toddmparker> destroy
[11:34:56] <toddmparker> disable
[11:34:58] <toddmparker> enable
[11:34:59] <toddmparker> option
[11:34:59] <toddmparker> widget
[11:35:14] <arschmitz> maybe not call it widget then and just a JS guidlines doc with a widget section?
[11:35:22] <toddmparker> ^ i wonder if writing destroy methods for every widget will be a ton of work for 1.4
[11:35:29] <toddmparker> stuff like that
[11:35:41] <arschmitz> destroy should not really be that bad
[11:35:47] <arschmitz> just look at what you have done in dom
[11:35:51] <arschmitz> and undo it
[11:35:51] <uGoMobi_> I don't think so either
[11:35:57] <toddmparker> ok
[11:36:10] <arschmitz> just a lot of remov() removerClass stuff
[11:36:11] <toddmparker> so johnbender - looking at this list, what stuff would you trim off
[11:36:35] <uGoMobi_> not if we don't add them with JS anymore ;)
[11:36:48] <toddmparker> true
[11:36:57] <arschmitz> there will always be some im sure
[11:37:01] <uGoMobi_> true
[11:37:13] <toddmparker> so what are the key punch list items here?
[11:37:27] <toddmparker> 1, 2
[11:37:39] <toddmparker> 3. Widgets should be stateful and support dynamic setting of all options.
[11:37:58] <arschmitz> i kinda think 1-10 are the big ones
[11:38:02] <uGoMobi_> 1 - 7 I think
[11:38:30] <toddmparker> +1 for 1-7
[11:38:37] <toddmparker> 10 seems like a note for destroy
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> well 1-9 really 10 is covered by 1
[11:38:46] <uGoMobi_> except 4 maybe
[11:39:06] <arschmitz> 4 is important for supporting refresh
[11:39:13] <arschmitz> but could be more a suggestion
[11:39:40] <toddmparker> most of these are recommendations for sure
[11:39:44] <toddmparker> best practices
[11:39:54] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:39:58] <toddmparker> arschmitz: mind breaking that up
[11:40:02] <arschmitz> sure
[11:40:04] <toddmparker> i can't edit anymore :(
[11:40:14] <arschmitz> you made your own private copy
[11:40:18] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit+
[11:40:37] <johnbender> toddmparker: I wouldn't trim off anything
[11:40:40] <johnbender> I would just pick the top 5
[11:40:53] <johnbender> toddmparker: let me think about it
[11:40:57] <toddmparker> ok
[11:41:11] <toddmparker> i want to walk thru this with scott_gonzalez after too
[11:41:21] <toddmparker> I think this is important: if a widget may be used in a global context ( on every page ) make it able to live outside the page ( allows it to not have to be sent and enhanced on every page load ).
[11:41:31] <toddmparker> i'd vote to move that up
[11:41:47] <uGoMobi_> agreed
[11:42:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: looking forward to being good UI citizens
[11:42:07] <uGoMobi_> otherwise issues/feature request guaranteed
[11:42:10] <arschmitz> Yeah me too!
[11:42:11] <toddmparker> every UI widget or utility should work standalone, no page requirements
[11:42:28] <johnbender> toddmparker: that's a big one
[11:42:30] <toddmparker> Q: on this one
[11:42:37] <johnbender> toddmparker: so it seems like there are two things herre
[11:42:41] <johnbender> stuff we need for widgets
[11:42:44] <toddmparker> johnbender: it is, but super important
[11:42:45] <johnbender> well three things
[11:42:54] <johnbender> stuff we want for 1.4
[11:42:57] <toddmparker> one of the biggest complaints now
[11:43:04] <johnbender> and guidelines
[11:43:39] <toddmparker> right
[11:43:45] <toddmparker> most are guidelines
[11:44:11] <toddmparker> So my Q on:
[11:44:13] <toddmparker> Flag to say the markup is already pre-enhanced so if using client-side templating, you could generate the slider markup from the start and not have us do the generation. We’d just handle event binding in these cases.
[11:44:28] <toddmparker> how hard would it be to do that?
[11:44:39] <arschmitz> really easy in my oppinion
[11:44:48] <arschmitz> it would just be an option
[11:45:10] <toddmparker> we already have all the markup manip stuff broken out, right?
[11:45:21] <toddmparker> just don't run that if this is off
[11:45:22] <arschmitz> on some widgets
[11:45:25] <uGoMobi_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4935
[11:45:25] <b-ot> uGoMobi_: Issue #4935 by frequent (6mon 4w ago): feature request: trigger('eventcreate') to set event bindings to a widget without enhancing the markup
[11:45:49] <arschmitz> but really it should probably be that way
[11:46:00] <arschmitz> -1 for it being an event trigger
[11:46:33] <toddmparker> just an option when you call the widget
[11:46:41] <uGoMobi_> ok
[11:46:42] <arschmitz> yup
[11:46:45] <toddmparker> mind linking this issue up
[11:46:56] <arschmitz> sure
[11:47:03] <toddmparker> or creating a new one with the preferred way and closing this
[11:47:09] <toddmparker> that's probably better
[11:47:30] <toddmparker> so those two should move up - living outside a page and no enhancement
[11:47:43] <toddmparker> once you edit that, we can take a look
[11:48:30] <toddmparker> anything else here need discussion? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[11:49:08] <arschmitz> if any one wants to look i did a quick top 5 and then best practices there already
[11:49:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz: seems like #5 is a best practice
[11:49:32] <arschmitz> true
[11:49:51] <arschmitz> moved
[11:49:52] <uGoMobi_> I thought All bindings should be done with _on and _off was a big one too
[11:50:01] <arschmitz> its really covered by 4
[11:50:09] <arschmitz> as a must
[11:50:14] <uGoMobi_> ah true
[11:50:22] <arschmitz> same with destroy and trigger
[11:50:28] <toddmparker> maybe just note that in #4
[11:50:39] <toddmparker> _on - use for all bindings
[11:50:45] <toddmparker> etc.
[11:51:06] <arschmitz> i tagged those with (MUST)
[11:51:17] <uGoMobi_> great
[11:51:31] <arschmitz> broke perfromance into a 3rd section
[11:52:23] <johnbender> seems like top 3 and then standalone widgets
[11:53:15] <arschmitz> i inclueded 4 because of _on _off _destroy and _trigger
[11:53:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: yar
[11:53:37] <johnbender> arschmitz: makes good sense to me
[11:53:45] <johnbender> hot damn so excited about this stuff
[11:53:52] <arschmitz> only reason i didnt include stand alone
[11:54:00] <toddmparker> johnbender: agree on moving standalone widgets into the top
[11:54:04] <arschmitz> is because i see 1-4 as 1.4 punch list
[11:54:14] <johnbender> arschmitz: yap it doesn't really belong on the list perse
[11:54:17] <arschmitz> and that might be a lot for all widgets on 1.4
[11:54:24] <johnbender> agree
[11:54:26] <uGoMobi_> it sure is
[11:54:38] <toddmparker> but you should tick off the box and make sure it works
[11:54:54] <arschmitz> i think going forward with new widgets it should be #5
[11:55:03] <arschmitz> but for 1.4 widget review its not 100%
[11:55:17] <arschmitz> its what we can get to
[11:55:18] <toddmparker> right. we can be selective if needed
[11:55:26] <arschmitz> prioritize
[11:55:28] <toddmparker> what about the no-enhance?
[11:55:55] <arschmitz> strong suggestion but not 100% for a lot of widgets i think
[11:55:59] <toddmparker> i'd at least move those out of "possible additions" and into widget standards
[11:56:07] <arschmitz> yes i agree ill give it a place on list
[11:56:12] <toddmparker> ok
[11:56:25] <toddmparker> cool. i'm excited to shape up all the widgets
[11:56:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: random thought, it is possible to standardize on refresh as the "enhance" method in our widgets?
[11:56:40] <toddmparker> arschmitz: might be easier if that was a real numbered list :)
[11:56:51] <johnbender> that way we can just wrap those calls in guard that checks the markup
[11:57:04] <arschmitz> johnbender glad you mentioned
[11:57:11] <toddmparker> interesting idea
[11:57:18] <arschmitz> thats how i write my own widgets already
[11:57:23] <johnbender> _create shouldn't be doing much work imo
[11:57:26] <arschmitz> and i meant to add that to possible additions
[11:57:31] <johnbender> that's like object instantiation
[11:57:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: exactly
[11:57:45] <arschmitz> it also makes options easy to handle
[11:57:48] <arschmitz> just call refresh
[11:57:48] <johnbender> yar
[11:57:59] <johnbender> so all enhancements in refresh
[11:58:03] <arschmitz> yup
[11:58:04] <johnbender> clean out _create
[11:58:23] <arschmitz> yeah thats how i do all my own personal widgets so much easier to deal with i think
[11:58:24] <uGoMobi_> actually I was about to do that for panel
[11:58:37] <uGoMobi_> to create a refresh method
[11:58:47] <arschmitz> johnbender glad you mentioned though i had forgot to add to list
[11:58:53] <johnbender> cool
[11:59:30] <toddmparker> write it up, sounds like a great plan
[11:59:36] <arschmitz> already on there
[11:59:43] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks for doing that
[11:59:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: whole eff ton of stuff I wouldn't have thought up
[11:59:54] <toddmparker> so you can use that to either update based on markup changes *or* to change options?
[11:59:55] <johnbender> *of
[11:59:58] <arschmitz> johnbender no thank you for remembering
[12:00:01] <johnbender> I've just had a mental checklist for a long time
[12:00:20] <toddmparker> anything else up in yer noggin johnbender
[12:00:27] <johnbender> oh
[12:00:38] <johnbender> if anyone has time to look at how transitions are setup I welcome feedback
[12:00:55] <johnbender> the method names need changing probably but I just kept those from the previous setup
[12:01:06] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: I am going to give that a look for sure
[12:01:10] <arschmitz> johnbender iv been in there a bunch already so ill take a look
[12:01:16] <johnbender> and the "abstract methods" in the transition parent class could be done differenlty but that was a quick hack and it works
[12:01:34] <arschmitz> do we want to look at last for maybe items on list?
[12:01:39] <johnbender> it's plain ol' js objects
[12:04:38] <toddmparker> great, should we make a ticket for that specific thing?
[12:05:55] <toddmparker> bueller?
[12:06:21] <toddmparker> alright, this was great stuff. seems like we're very close with 1.3.1 and have a solid plan for re-factoring for 1.4
[12:06:47] <uGoMobi_> nice :)
[12:07:28] <toddmparker> ok, think we can wrap up
[12:07:33] <toddmparker> any Q's from the community?
[12:07:44] <mspisars> toddmparker: when is 1.4 scheduled for release (approx.)?
[12:08:08] <mspisars> what timeframe are you targeting?
[12:08:18] * johnbender grabs the popcorn
[12:08:42] <johnbender> mspisars: we haven't actually nailed down what we're going to do for 1.4
[12:08:45] <johnbender> so it's hard to say
[12:08:47] <arschmitz> if any one has time id like oppinions on remaining 3 Possible additions: items
[12:08:53] <johnbender> but I'll defer to todd on that
[12:09:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: looking
[12:09:03] <toddmparker> I think we're 2 months out from a beta or RC at a minimum
[12:09:22] <toddmparker> That seem about right everyone?
[12:09:26] <uGoMobi_> we might want to do an alpha first
[12:09:29] <mspisars> so ~june to see first tags of 1.4?
[12:09:37] <johnbender> mspisars: if we're lucky :(
[12:09:43] <mspisars> lol
[12:09:51] <arschmitz> yeah LOTS of work for 1.4
[12:09:54] <toddmparker> right. release will depend on how many cycles (alpha, beta, RCs)
[12:10:03] <mspisars> yes, but this is the stuff I've been waiting for
[12:10:04] <uGoMobi_> yeah 2-3 months at least I think
[12:10:06] <toddmparker> but I see us needing a solid 8 weeks to get through all this.
[12:10:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: the second of the three is tough because I think we support it in some cases :(
[12:10:28] <toddmparker> if we had more help mspisars...
[12:10:37] <johnbender> yah we need to post this to an issue
[12:10:39] <johnbender> the punch list
[12:10:41] <toddmparker> wanna help us do some widget cleanup?
[12:10:45] <johnbender> then folks lik mspisars can dive in
[12:10:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: i guess the question is SHOULD we support it
[12:10:56] <toddmparker> yeah, exactly.
[12:11:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: no we definitely shouldn't
[12:11:03] <johnbender> arschmitz: but we do
[12:11:06] <johnbender> so we need to depricate
[12:11:10] <arschmitz> for widgets not for things like links
[12:11:21] <toddmparker> i we have clear guidelines and maybe an example or two of a widget we've cleaned up, that will help with contributions
[12:11:29] <mspisars> i can try, but i do have many commitments so, not sure how much time I can commit regularly
[12:11:35] <johnbender> arschmitz: in any case we provide an api to alter the config after the fact the data attribute is just the starting point
[12:11:40] <johnbender> that's where we landed last we discussed
[12:11:46] <toddmparker> no pressure mspisars
[12:11:54] <arschmitz> yeah so ill add to list
[12:11:58] <johnbender> mspisars: it's ok, we need to do it so people *like* you can contrib if they have time
[12:12:12] <johnbender> mspisars: ultimately it's up to use to get it done
[12:12:16] <toddmparker> but we do need help so if you're lurking and want to help out, give us a should here or on #jquerymobile-dev
[12:12:21] <johnbender> toddmparker: we don't have to to ALL of it for 1.4 either
[12:12:29] <toddmparker> johnbender: right
[12:12:30] <johnbender> we can keep working on it in the background
[12:12:35] <mspisars> yeah im in -dev regularly
[12:12:49] <johnbender> toddmparker: given how much work there is you might want to pick a freeze date
[12:12:54] <toddmparker> i'd like to focus on a lot of the UI widgets first - forms, collapsibles, etc.
[12:12:58] <johnbender> after which widget refactor branches won't get merged
[12:13:15] <toddmparker> stuff people might want to use in isolation and would need all the methods
[12:13:31] <toddmparker> johnbender: yeap
[12:13:38] <mspisars> toddmparker: that is exactly what i need
[12:14:03] <toddmparker> looks like end of june would be as late as we should go before releasing something for feedback
[12:14:29] <arschmitz> gives us 3 months of actual work
[12:14:29] <toddmparker> we can keep cooking up until we hit RC too
[12:15:01] <toddmparker> i will be bring some Filament help in soon too
[12:15:17] <toddmparker> since uGoMobi will be heads down on theming
[12:15:35] <toddmparker> re-factor is arschmitz, johnbender, gseguin and _|Nix|_
[12:15:46] <toddmparker> and whoever else we can recruit
[12:15:55] <johnbender> A-team
[12:15:56] <uGoMobi_> theming, buttonMarkup, transitions
[12:16:05] <johnbender> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyz_2DEah4o
[12:16:06] <toddmparker> I love it when a plan comes together
[12:16:07] <johnbender> recognize
[12:16:32] <toddmparker> love that show
[12:16:39] <uGoMobi_> :)
[12:16:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi one thing i want to work with you on is how panel animations will work if its not inside a page div
[12:17:03] <arschmitz> will have to rethink how they work completely i think
[12:17:07] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: yeah that's going to be interesting
[12:17:10] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, that would be great if we can move it outside
[12:17:25] <arschmitz> im trying to finish up toolbars outside page now
[12:17:32] <arschmitz> after that im going to start panels
[12:17:47] <uGoMobi_> unfortunately CSS doesn't work like * < .ui-panel
[12:17:49] <toddmparker> rdavidwu_ was just asking about when we think we'd add in the top/bottom panels he built
[12:18:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i thinking it will need completely seperate handling when outside page
[12:18:15] <toddmparker> eesh.
[12:18:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: maybe we should hold off on panel changes until its where we want it ( if we want to move out of page)
[12:18:50] <toddmparker> but if the *goal* is to just re-use a panel across pages, maybe we can leave it where it is markup-wise and do something about re-use
[12:18:54] <arschmitz> then it can be refactored to where the current panel lands
[12:19:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker makes things complicated to handel removing the panel from the page and adding back
[12:19:30] <toddmparker> i definitely want to stay focused in 1.4. lots to do.
[12:19:38] <arschmitz> lots of nav hooks
[12:19:45] <arschmitz> if you actualy put outside page div
[12:19:49] <toddmparker> right
[12:19:51] <arschmitz> it can just stay and not care
[12:19:59] <arschmitz> and just animate .ui-page-active
[12:20:37] <arschmitz> seems like it would be better to have seperate anamation handeling rather then a lot of nav hooks
[12:20:38] <uGoMobi_> yeah I am sure we can work something out
[12:20:51] <toddmparker> wonder if this is where the ajax link thing would be useful
[12:21:04] <arschmitz> ajax link thing
[12:21:05] <arschmitz> ?
[12:21:21] <toddmparker> esp if you could place the panel markup outside the page in a multi-page doc and somehow add a hook within each page where the markup should be moved to on page show
[12:21:43] <toddmparker> so we just move that chunk of markup into whatever page is open
[12:22:04] <arschmitz> still requires nav hooks which seems like un-needed complication to me
[12:22:05] <toddmparker> actually, we have a plugin that does that already called appendaround
[12:22:42] <arschmitz> but anyway should probably move to dev this is digressing lol
[12:22:52] <uGoMobi_> right
[12:23:05] <toddmparker> it looks to see which of the multiple "slots" a piece of markup could live in is visible and tosses it there
[12:23:25] <toddmparker> right, good thing to think bout tho
[12:23:30] <toddmparker> alright, wrapping up here
[12:23:37] <toddmparker> thanks everyone!
[12:23:41] <uGoMobi_> if the panel is outside the page just position absolute should do the trick right?
[12:23:50] <arschmitz> yes
[12:23:52] <uGoMobi_> well, have to think about it....
[12:23:56] <johnbender> TO THE -DEV
[12:23:59] <uGoMobi_> later all
[12:24:01] * johnbender waves
[12:24:03] <toddmparker> later
