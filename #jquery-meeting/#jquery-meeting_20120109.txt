[09:00:15] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:00:57] <addyosmani> ..
[09:03:00] <DaveMethvin> so i'm getting a late start on the agenda
[09:03:18] <DaveMethvin> who else is here?
[09:03:34] <gnarf> i am
[09:04:16] <DaveMethvin> addyosmani rwaldron timmywil gnarf
[09:04:24] <gnarf> rwaldron is not here today
[09:04:50] * DaveMethvin sniff
[09:05:32] <DaveMethvin> well it looks like it will be a short meeting ... howya doing gnarf?
[09:06:06] <gnarf> good
[09:06:13] <gnarf> getting back into the swing of working
[09:06:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[09:06:29] <DaveMethvin> really goofed off during the holidays
[09:06:32] <gnarf> yeah
[09:06:44] <gnarf> SWTOR was released too, so I've been playing a lot of that ;)
[09:06:48] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:06:52] <timmywil> hi
[09:06:56] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:06:57] <gnarf> but um - meeting - do we need to do anything about these 1.8 votes?
[09:07:23] <DaveMethvin> if nobody had objections i was going to close the ones in the minus territory
[09:07:30] <gnarf> docs#10417
[09:07:32] <bot-t> [#10417] jQuery.later (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/10417
[09:07:37] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: +1
[09:08:01] <DaveMethvin> so on .later i wondered if we should use something more obvious like .setImmediate
[09:08:08] <gnarf> docs#10770
[09:08:09] <bot-t> [#10770] Investigate re-ordering build file (open enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/10770
[09:08:23] <gnarf> that can prolly stay "open" if mike wants to "Investigate" it
[09:08:28] <DaveMethvin> my feeling on 10770 is that it's kind of ongoing
[09:08:32] <gnarf> true
[09:09:06] <DaveMethvin> that was a specific thing that i doubt we'll want to mess with
[09:09:13] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I have to split in a few minutes. any API issues that need my attention?
[09:09:24] <gnarf> timmywil: you don't think its worth jQuery.later ?
[09:09:28] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: i think we're good
[09:09:36] <kswedberg> awesome. thx, DaveMethvin
[09:10:06] <gnarf> and DaveMethvin - i'm okay with setImmediate, but like "later" is nice and short
[09:10:11] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i think it's worth doing if we need it internally in a few places
[09:10:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah i know :D
[09:10:26] <gnarf> we have 5 uses inside jQuery itself
[09:10:36] <DaveMethvin> well that's a few by my defn
[09:10:47] <gnarf> not counting the uses in UI
[09:10:49] <gnarf> which are even more
[09:11:37] <gnarf> http://dbaron.org/mozilla/zero-timeout
[09:11:46] <DaveMethvin> we'll need owners for the stuff that needs to be done
[09:12:03] <DaveMethvin> i need to ping jaubourg, haven't' heard from him for a while
[09:13:01] <DaveMethvin> so i'm in no hurry to release 1.8, do you guys have thoughts on a timeline for that?
[09:13:32] <gnarf> I don't think it will be a rush
[09:13:33] <DaveMethvin> I wanted to clean up the 1.7.2 issues in the next couple of weeks, so we could do a release for that soon
[09:13:55] <DaveMethvin> but with 1.8 i don't think users are pressing us for anything critical
[09:13:55] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: is there a report of 1.7 bugs we need to investigate?
[09:14:06] <DaveMethvin> a few odds and ends in the tricker
[09:14:09] <DaveMethvin> tracker
[09:14:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:14:18] <DaveMethvin> sometimes it is a tricker
[09:14:35] <DaveMethvin> damn thing gives me a stack trace ... that's something we need to fix come to think of it
[09:14:41] <DaveMethvin> maybe mikesherov can take a look
[09:16:35] <jaubourg> omg late
[09:16:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do you think we should use http://ajaxian.com/archives/settimeout-delay - or should we just use https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setImmediate and setTimeout?
[09:17:00] <gnarf> speak of the devil
[09:17:06] <gnarf> and the LOLBAT appears ;)
[09:17:09] <jaubourg> $.later we're talking about right ?
[09:17:14] <gnarf> jaubourg: ya
[09:17:21] <DaveMethvin> yay jaubourg!
[09:17:26] <gnarf> jaubourg: also, DaveMethvin thinks we should just $.setImmediate
[09:17:29] <jaubourg> hey Dave, gnarf, everyone :)
[09:17:51] <jaubourg> erk... $.setImmediate is soooo long
[09:18:03] <jaubourg> $
[09:18:09] <gnarf> i like $.later more myself
[09:18:10] <jaubourg> $.getElementById why not?
[09:18:12] <jaubourg> :P
[09:18:19] <timmywil> gnarf: ya, I'm not convinced it's worth it
[09:18:52] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, on the implementation i wasn't aware there were better tricks than setTimeout( ..., 0)
[09:18:53] <jaubourg> timmy: $.later or using setImmediate?
[09:19:11] <timmywil> either one
[09:19:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, the postMessage is much speedier ;)
[09:19:44] <gnarf> i imagine setImmediate is the speediest when it exists
[09:19:51] <DaveMethvin> if setImmediate is pretty widely implemented i would just use that and then fallback to setTimeout
[09:19:53] <timmywil> setImmediate is still not part of the spec btw
[09:20:09] <DaveMethvin> i suspect that only penalizes IE, and not critically
[09:20:20] <jaubourg> whatever the implementation I think it would be nice to have it as a jquery method
[09:20:39] <timmywil> it is only implemented by recent ie
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg, thoughts on the ajax and promise tix?
[09:21:45] <jaubourg> tickets?
[09:22:10] <DaveMethvin> http://goo.gl/SeuVZ  in general
[09:22:12] <jaubourg> I pretty much need to fix this callbacks bug
[09:22:45] <timmywil> according to mdn, it's not expected to become part of the spec, so I'd like to wait until it is more fleshed out.  setTimeout(fn,0) is common and even optimized in modern browsers.  I don't see a good enough reason to add a call to the stack yet.
[09:23:23] <jaubourg> Dave: well, I'd love to remove async false, other than that, I just have to implement some stuff and be done with it
[09:23:45] <jaubourg> are we Promise/A complying jQuery or not?
[09:23:53] <DaveMethvin> looks like we are, i think we should
[09:23:58] <jaubourg> so do I
[09:24:50] <DaveMethvin> i haven't heard from the closure guys for a week, i guess i need to ping them again
[09:25:00] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't seem like that is progressing quickly
[09:25:22] <DaveMethvin> or maybe it's just really, really, hard
[09:25:24] * jaubourg won't say he is not surprised and will refrain from commenting on any of this :P
[09:26:01] <DaveMethvin> i have a branch i was tinkering with that stubbed out animation and removed some of the ie hooks
[09:26:13] <DaveMethvin> didn't save all that much, maybe 3kb
[09:26:30] <jaubourg> I think the guys of Closure are doing a tremendous job, but I don't see this going anywhere as the only solution jQuery provides to shrink size
[09:26:35] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to try stubbing ajax to see what that bought
[09:26:36] <jaubourg> damnit, I commented
[09:26:39] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:26:56] <DaveMethvin> well unless there is some silver bullet i don't see it getting that much smaller
[09:27:02] <DaveMethvin> even if we deprecate stuff
[09:27:13] <DaveMethvin> maybe it goes down to 25kb from 32kb
[09:27:24] <DaveMethvin> and thats if we hack out big stuff
[09:28:11] <DaveMethvin> but i  have been doing a lot of site analysis for some consulting and can tell you that a LOT of sites seem to not care about either performance or size
[09:28:23] <jaubourg> I know
[09:28:24] <DaveMethvin> apple.com doesn't even compress or combine their scripts
[09:28:33] <DaveMethvin> and you KNOW they use a lot of bw
[09:28:59] <DaveMethvin> just tons of sites have two dozen included script and css files on every page
[09:29:40] <DaveMethvin> so i do think that this is more of interest to the extremes
[09:29:45] <DaveMethvin> not to the mainstream
[09:30:19] <DaveMethvin> so if we have some makefile option to build some custom versions that exclude stuff I'd consider that fine, and let people fork it to build their own
[09:30:49] <jaubourg> I'd really like to know where Slex's modular version is at
[09:30:52] <DaveMethvin> all we neeed to do for that is to eliminate some dependencies and document the makefile options
[09:31:00] <jaubourg> also, I need to do this tracer thingy
[09:31:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah he mentioend that a while back
[09:31:19] <jaubourg> didn't have tme during the hollidays, should be able to have some time this week
[09:31:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah back to the coal mines jaubourg
[09:31:32] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:31:34] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:32:00] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so I've been thinking - on the topic of reducing size
[09:32:24] <gnarf> has anyone ever succesfully setup some code coverage tools for jQuery?
[09:32:37] <DaveMethvin> not that i know of
[09:32:47] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: was looking at doing some trace stuff
[09:32:48] <jaubourg> gnarf: I'm supposed to work on this
[09:32:49] <gnarf> a) it would be really interesting to see what % coverage we have with our unit tests
[09:33:00] <jaubourg> I have started it, just need to finish it :P
[09:33:03] <DaveMethvin> s/interesting/depressing/
[09:33:06] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:33:08] <gnarf> b) we might find some dead code branches
[09:33:35] <DaveMethvin> measurements like that always bring up interesting questions
[09:34:53] <DaveMethvin> ok as far as schedule goes, let's see what needs to be done first for 1.7.2 and then get names next to 1.8 work
[09:35:28] <DaveMethvin> just grab the ticket if you want it
[09:35:30] <jaubourg> ok
[09:35:44] <DaveMethvin> and then we'll force tickets on people :D
[09:36:01] <jaubourg> hahaha
[09:36:07] <DaveMethvin> some of them are just docs atm since they're deprecations
[09:37:48] <gnarf> docs#10944 ?
[09:37:49] <bot-t> [#10944] $.ajax does not always return an object implementing the Promise interface (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/10944
[09:38:17] <gnarf> fuckin mysql server gone away errors left and right on trac nowadays
[09:38:40] <jaubourg> heh
[09:38:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it seems to be getting worse
[09:38:50] <jaubourg> it's a breaking change, this ajax stuff
[09:39:20] <jaubourg> but I think it's worth it... just be aware the silent majority will jump at us, because if( $.ajax(...) ) is that convenient
[09:39:55] <gnarf> i think that its worth it too
[09:39:56] <DaveMethvin> it seems unlikely someoen is depending on the current behavior though?
[09:40:09] <jaubourg> unlikely, yes, probably, yes :/
[09:40:11] <DaveMethvin> that is, one person's breaking change is another's fixed bug
[09:40:18] <jaubourg> as usual
[09:40:51] <gnarf> i think the fixed bug is more important than the backwards compat
[09:40:57] <gnarf> at least on this one
[09:41:03] <gnarf> its so close to being "unified"
[09:41:06] <DaveMethvin> and the docs say it works the way we intend to fix it anyway
[09:41:45] <jaubourg> true
[09:41:57] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: do you think you can get the code tracing done this week?
[09:42:04] <gnarf> it deletes a unit test tho right?
[09:42:28] <jaubourg> Dave: I sure want to do it this week... that's as good of an answer I can give given my schedule
[09:42:48] <jaubourg> gnarf: yes, it's unit tested
[09:43:20] <jaubourg> but we can keep the unit test and change it to suit the new behaviour
[09:43:29] <gnarf> true
[09:43:34] <gnarf> make it check for the right "error" or whatever
[09:43:41] <jaubourg> yep
[09:45:40] <DaveMethvin> anybody else have anything?
[09:45:48] <DaveMethvin> i have to run off in a minute
[09:45:58] <jaubourg> nothing comes to mind right now
[09:46:37] <DaveMethvin> well don't be strangers! i'll see if I can get someone to look at trac and get it feeling better
[09:47:10] <DaveMethvin> and also look at the 1.7.2 tickets, prolly be bugging you guys on those later
[09:47:26] <DaveMethvin> cya in -dev later!
[09:48:13] <jaubourg> k, time to fly for the frenchman too
[09:48:22] <gnarf> closing channel
