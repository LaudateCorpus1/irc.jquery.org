[12:05:20] <arschmitz> hi
[12:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on getting TestSwarm green.
[12:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> But there was a problem with either BrowserStack or TestSwarm for a bit, so that made it hard since I couldn't get results.
[12:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting closer though: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryui
[12:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> I've reset some failed test runs because I think some of them aren't real.
[12:07:52] <arschmitz> core git is all sorts of busted but the rest is getting close
[12:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the core team just breaks shit on us all the time.
[12:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> I've given up on getting the jquery-git builds to always be green.
[12:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'll occasionally look at the failures to see if it's a bug in core.
[12:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> At this point, I think we're good to release.
[12:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look through the failing tests to verify there's nothing big in there.
[12:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have anything else specific to discuss today.
[12:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> Do you?
[12:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not.
[12:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
