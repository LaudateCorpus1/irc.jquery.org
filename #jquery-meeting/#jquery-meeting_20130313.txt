[09:01:02] <petersendidit> hello
[09:01:33] <tj_vantoll_phone> Hey
[09:01:39] <rxaviers> hello
[09:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> We finally did it. Our bug count is under 350!
[09:02:09] <tj_vantoll_phone> :)
[09:02:43] <petersendidit> !!
[09:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll_phone has been doing a great job of finding duplicates and previously fixed tickets.
[09:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> And mikesherov landed a few multi-ticket fixes.
[09:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> Resulting in 22 fewer bugs this week compared to last week :-)
[09:04:46] <jzaefferer> oh hi
[09:04:52] <jzaefferer> DST shift is still annoying
[09:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: indeed
[09:05:18] <tj_vantoll_phone> Yes it is.
[09:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Want to give a download builder update?
[09:06:08] <rxaviers> sure,
[09:06:53] <rxaviers> master is live, we had (during the past weeks) a bunch of bug fixes.
[09:07:06] <rxaviers> Now, we render templates on client using handlebars
[09:07:17] <rxaviers> and we are using concated/minified JSes.
[09:07:30] <rxaviers> All seemed a wonderland until I deployed it live.
[09:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:08:07] <rxaviers> Occasionally, I see an error when user downloads.
[09:08:27] <rxaviers> it seems it misses the `version` of the form. Still debugging.
[09:08:37] <rxaviers> it's intermittent
[09:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: This is a new issue, right?
[09:11:44] <rxaviers> that's correct
[09:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> So we should hold off on the 1.10.2 release until this is resolved.
[09:12:06] <rxaviers> ok. Im working hard to try to address it as soon as I can
[09:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers, DaveMethvin and I had a meeting with MS Open Tech about hand.js
[09:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> http://aka.ms/handjs
[09:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> We might be able to work with them on their low-level Pointer Events polyfill and then just use that.
[09:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's not clear how easy/sane it will be to shim at the DOM level though.
[09:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> Daniel Freedman from Chrome is also working on a DOM level polyfill
[09:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> http://github.com/toolkitchen/PointerEvents
[09:15:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: want to discuss that bug a little later? Maybe I can help tracking it down
[09:16:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sure, just let me know when you're available for that. In the meanwhile, Im debugging i
[09:16:02] <rxaviers> t
[09:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to reach out to him and see if he's willing to support old IE and/or work with the Microsoft team.
[09:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have high hopes for that though.
[09:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> Just because dealing with old IE means lots of limitations.
[09:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> MS Open Tech seems very interested in collaborating and meeting our requirements though.
[09:18:49] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:19:18] <jzaefferer> so that chrome-guy polyfill wouldn't cover enough browsers for our needs, but hand.js does?
[09:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> Right now neither does.
[09:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> But they're looking to add support in hand.js
[09:22:06] <jzaefferer> sounds promising
[09:22:30] <jzaefferer> but MS would keep owning that codebase, right?
[09:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they'd continue to manage the hand.js repo.
[09:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> But they'd work with us.
[09:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> And if we decided to pull hand.js into jQuery like we do with Sizzle, they'd be willing to change the license to MIT.
[09:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> We'll continue to prototype with a special events implementation, so that we can compare the solutions.
[09:24:22] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Got an update on selectmenu?
[09:25:20] <jzaefferer> Worked on that with Felix last week(end)
[09:25:44] <jzaefferer> From our point of view, its ready
[09:25:59] <jzaefferer> including API docs
[09:26:39] <jzaefferer> mostly waiting for 1.10.2
[09:26:48] <jzaefferer> to merge to master
[09:27:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok, after I do a review of the interactions branch, I'll let you know when I'm ready to do a review of selectmenu
[09:27:51] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> Is it up to date with master?
[09:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> (have you merged master in recently)
[09:28:39] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:28:41] <jzaefferer> recently
[09:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> great
[09:30:04] <jzaefferer> btw. I looked at our roadmap recently and commented there: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[09:30:23] <jzaefferer> Any clue for button redesign documents are?
[09:30:44] <jzaefferer> Or what's going on with effects?
[09:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> Button might get pushed.
[09:30:55] <jzaefferer> Or the classes option?
[09:30:59] <jzaefferer> demo system?
[09:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov has huge effects changes coming.
[09:31:18] <jzaefferer> And we should get those other things on there, since we're actively working on them
[09:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> classes option may die.
[09:31:46] <jzaefferer> even if we don't work on button - do we have the redesign doc anywhere?
[09:31:53] <jzaefferer> did we ever have one?
[09:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> We never did one.
[09:33:10] <jzaefferer> Okay
[09:33:30] <jzaefferer> Since that is likely to be influenced by whatever happens in Mobile 1.4, let's push Button back
[09:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's mostly just internal cleanup
[09:34:02] <jzaefferer> "classes option may die." I feel like I missed discussion about that
[09:34:37] <jzaefferer> Did we have a redesign for slider?
[09:34:59] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> The classes option discussion was about one minute of discussion between me and tj_vantoll_phone.
[09:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> We need to have a bigger discussion.
[09:35:54] <jzaefferer> I see
[09:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> Basically, I think we're solving the problem in the wrong place.
[09:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> We're trying to solve a CSS problem in JS.
[09:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> And if we just keep holding out, CSS will eventually solve the problem.
[09:36:34] <jzaefferer> How about we rewrite our roadmap to list things we plan to work on. Where we only put things into the upcoming release once its clear it'll make it. Like Selectmenu to make it into 1.11.
[09:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> The roadmap is just a rough idea.
[09:37:10] <tj_vantoll_phone> Yeah I wanted to finish a triage pass of sortable then I was going to investigate.
[09:43:42] <jzaefferer> So we need more discussion about classes option, datepicker, grunt/downloadbuilder, maybe slider and button
[09:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:44:54] <jzaefferer> For a start, I could do tomorrow morning, the hour before the testing meeting. Or two hours before. 9am or 10am ET, I think
[09:45:02] <jzaefferer> 2pm or 3pm for me
[09:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Does that work for you to talk about grunt/download builder?
[09:45:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: would one of those times work for you? ^
[09:45:32] <jzaefferer> ah, too slow
[09:46:03] <rxaviers> either one is ok to me
[09:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, should we schedule a time or just catch each other in the morning (for me)
[09:49:39] <rxaviers> I'll be online.
[09:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you still need the selectmenu-aria* branches?
[09:53:23] <jzaefferer> No, I'll remove them
[09:54:10] <jzaefferer> So nice to click a "Delete this branch" button on GitHub :-)
[09:54:31] <jzaefferer> Let's schedule for tomorrow 9am ET?
[09:54:46] <jzaefferer> If we miss that, we can meet as soon as we're all online
[09:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll send an invite.
[09:55:48] <jzaefferer> on it
[09:56:05] <jzaefferer> sent :-)
[09:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> BLITZED
[09:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Accept jzaefferer's and decline mine
[09:57:15] <rxaviers> ;)
[09:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, don't worry about declining mine, I just deleted it.
[09:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:58:45] <rxaviers> just looked like a Western duel
