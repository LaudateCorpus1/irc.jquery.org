[11:01:09] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:03:20] <_|Nix|_> Here we go.
[11:03:21] <uGoMobi> sorry
[11:03:22] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:03:24] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:03:38] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:04:23] <uGoMobi> who else is here
[11:05:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom and toddmparker can't join today
[11:05:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz gseguin RWhitbeck ?
[11:05:27] <arschmitz> here
[11:05:36] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[11:05:55] <uGoMobi> agenda/updates /mode -m #jquery-meeting
[11:06:00] <uGoMobi> grrr
[11:06:11] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uDpyNM9CQDPLoA5f1ypfzSsiH1ePYT8qqZBYgxPjqLI/edit?usp=sharing
[11:06:17] <uGoMobi> that's better :)
[11:07:17] * gseguin is back
[11:07:23] <uGoMobi> so we are about to release 1.4 beta
[11:07:28] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:07:32] <gseguin> w00t!
[11:08:16] <gseguin> wanna wait for the conference or not?
[11:08:20] <uGoMobi> all this docs, demos, upgrade guide, blog post stuff is taking a lot of time :(
[11:08:41] <uGoMobi> I want to have beta out before the conference
[11:08:54] <uGoMobi> but I also want people to actually going to test it
[11:09:16] <uGoMobi> so that's why we spend more time on updating as much as possible
[11:09:24] <gseguin> makes sense
[11:09:46] <uGoMobi> today _|Nix|_ found out that two JS files were missing in the build
[11:09:51] <uGoMobi> two new features
[11:09:57] <_|Nix|_> My fault.
[11:09:57] <uGoMobi> and no one reported an issue
[11:10:13] <uGoMobi> no problem _|Nix|_
[11:10:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird, since we did mention the new features in the changelog.
[11:10:30] <gseguin> oh oops
[11:10:33] <uGoMobi> just saying that it worries me that no users reported it
[11:10:39] <_|Nix|_> True.
[11:10:58] <gseguin> yeah or that means that they're waiting for beta rather than alpha
[11:11:14] <uGoMobi> it's not new that people don't test alpha and beta versions much
[11:11:27] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah could be
[11:12:29] <arschmitz> we got an issue on 1.3 beta just yesterday so someone is testing betas :)
[11:13:13] <uGoMobi> I have a 15 hour flight tomorrow so I think I can finish upgrade guide and blog post during that :)
[11:13:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, after the 1.3 final release :/
[11:13:30] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:13:56] <arschmitz> and 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 and 1.4.o alpha and 1.4.0 alpha 2
[11:14:02] <arschmitz> they are only a little behind
[11:14:18] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:14:26] <uGoMobi> trying to finish demos as much as possible tonight
[11:14:36] <uGoMobi> how are we doing with fixing issues
[11:14:39] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:15:13] <arschmitz> i have 2 assigned to me currently
[11:15:24] <arschmitz> 1 im still working on the other is a demo
[11:15:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that are open tickets that need to be fixed before beta? (besides that demo)
[11:16:14] <arschmitz> i only have one asigned to me currently and yes it SHOULD be fixed its a big issue
[11:16:24] <uGoMobi> which one?
[11:16:34] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6347
[11:16:35] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6347 by doomsy (2w 6d ago): Scrolling vertically on panel fails after first scroll on ios device (1.4.0a2)
[11:16:59] <uGoMobi> ah that one
[11:17:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about you?
[11:17:26] <uGoMobi> anything you are still working on?
[11:17:37] <uGoMobi> how is textarea autogrow?
[11:18:33] <uGoMobi> in the meantime...
[11:18:40] <uGoMobi> I know how I can fix this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6348
[11:18:40] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6348 by uGoMobi (2w 6d ago): Theme inheritance during transition
[11:18:46] <uGoMobi> but I don't like the fix
[11:18:54] <arschmitz> what is it?
[11:18:59] <uGoMobi> because it would mean slower CSS selectors
[11:19:32] <uGoMobi> ui-page-theme-a should override ui-overlay-b
[11:20:33] <uGoMobi> so I am still looking at other ways to make this work and this need to be done before beta
[11:20:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how would that work with more then 2 swatches?
[11:21:18] <arschmitz> would theme just always override overlay?
[11:21:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry.
[11:21:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[11:21:37] <arschmitz> ok
[11:21:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: autogrow is good, except for animation.
[11:21:44] <uGoMobi> same as the rest of the theming
[11:22:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but the problem is that we are running out of elements/classes that I can use in the selector
[11:22:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Need to review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6436
[11:22:42] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Pull request #6436 by gabrielschulhof (1d 4h ago): Textinput autogrow transition
[11:23:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could this be the problem of infinite inheritance?
[11:23:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: One theme has to come before the other.
[11:23:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but I guess in this case there are only ever two pages involved. fromPage and toPage.
[11:23:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, that's a different situation
[11:25:07] <uGoMobi> I can explain later on -dev
[11:25:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that is a new PR for autogrow transition, right?
[11:25:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: yes, it addresses your diff comments.
[11:26:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's as final as I could make it.
[11:26:19] <uGoMobi> ok, I can give that a look again
[11:26:41] <uGoMobi> there is one other PR
[11:26:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It special-cases the textarea in the popup. There's never a transition when you open a popup, because there's a bug where the textarea is briefly extremely tall.
[11:27:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, popups are always sharp.
[11:27:14] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:27:40] <uGoMobi> and what happens when you just have a textarea, without any text, on a page?
[11:27:54] <uGoMobi> do we transition the height on pageshow?
[11:29:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We transition.
[11:29:23] <uGoMobi> that's a change compared to 1.3, right?
[11:29:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: All are smooth except popup. Attempt no smoothing there.
[11:29:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The transition is a change, yes.
[11:30:21] <uGoMobi> is the reason that we need to transition it now, the fact that we added autoshrink?
[11:31:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess so. We need to make sure that when the page shows up, the size of the textarea is what we would calculate it to be when we first update the height.
[11:31:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But of course we cannot ensure that until heights can be calculated.
[11:31:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So we must do it when the page is already visible.
[11:32:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which means that, on slow devices, the page might jerk.
[11:32:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, better to jerk smoothly :)
[11:32:47] <uGoMobi> right
[11:33:28] <uGoMobi> I still don't understand that it worked without transition in 1.3
[11:33:48] <uGoMobi> I mean, I would prefer it without transition
[11:33:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it'll work, but it might jerk.
[11:33:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: because it would only check if it needed to grow
[11:34:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, right.
[11:34:08] <arschmitz> it never checked if it was too small
[11:34:14] <arschmitz> to shrink
[11:34:19] <_|Nix|_> In 1.3 there was no need to do anything upon pageshow.
[11:34:30] <arschmitz> unless it had content
[11:34:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... might be better to shrink if and only if you have already grown once.
[11:35:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It was a mistake to size the textarea to its contents at pageshow time.
[11:35:14] <uGoMobi> I don't see why it would need to shrink
[11:35:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You type three paragraphs, and then you delete two.
[11:35:35] <uGoMobi> on init
[11:35:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because the size given by the browser is more than it needs for displaying the cursor.
[11:35:57] <arschmitz> because other wise it changes height when you type first char
[11:36:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[11:36:23] <_|Nix|_> I don't like this on-pageshow approach either.
[11:36:41] <arschmitz> and we could not fix this with css alone because it was inconsistant among browsers for some reason what was calculated
[11:37:03] <arschmitz> firefox bug is the cause
[11:37:05] <uGoMobi> yeah I noticed that on Firefo
[11:37:12] <uGoMobi> Firefox*
[11:37:52] <uGoMobi> didn't have to do with box-sizing?
[11:38:08] <arschmitz> i think it was about scrollHeight
[11:38:13] <arschmitz> and including padding
[11:38:17] <arschmitz> would have to find the ticket though
[11:38:18] <_|Nix|_> IMO, in a perfect world, we would leave the initial size up to devs, and, upon pageshow, we would set a flag that says "thou shalt only expand", and when it has expanded at least once, only then does the possible-shrink take effect.
[11:39:04] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, we assume that the initial size is correct, and we do not shrink when the user first starts typing.
[11:39:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: with the current logic thats not really possible because we dont know if we are growing or shrinking until after the height has already been changed to 0 for calculation
[11:39:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, actually, the height stays 0 for so short a time that it's not visible on screen.
[11:40:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After all, we set the height to 0 after the user has typed a character, and it certainly does not jerk.
[11:40:19] <arschmitz> true
[11:40:22] <uGoMobi> leaving the initial size up to the devs is not a solution
[11:40:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why not? What did people do before jQM?
[11:40:41] <uGoMobi> how can you set height if you don't know the width
[11:40:52] <uGoMobi> they got textarea with scrollbar
[11:41:00] <uGoMobi> we offer one that resizes
[11:41:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hold on ... for empty textareas, they can set a comfortable initial height, right?
[11:41:31] <uGoMobi> true
[11:41:38] <uGoMobi> we had min-height in the CSS
[11:41:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For ones with text, they can also set a comfortable initial height.
[11:41:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, they know their app.
[11:41:57] <uGoMobi> what is comfortable?
[11:42:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Depends on the initial text, the font size, etc. - all app-specific.
[11:42:12] <uGoMobi> but they don't know the device (screen)
[11:42:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They can be pessimistic.
[11:42:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So what if the textarea is initially too tall?
[11:42:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They can do media queries.
[11:42:53] <uGoMobi> that's true
[11:43:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The initial size of the textbox does not need to be correct.
[11:43:35] <_|Nix|_> The point is to never get a scrollbar - once the user starts typing.
[11:44:07] <_|Nix|_> But anyway, we've committed ourselves in 1.3.x to have an initially exactly correct height.
[11:44:16] <arschmitz> i think saying its not our problem figure it out your self is not really a good solution when we are setting all sorts of custom css on it right from the beginning
[11:44:21] <_|Nix|_> So, unless we deprecate that initial behaviour now, we'll be stuck with it.
[11:44:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What I'm saying is that devs can eyeball it for their target market.
[11:45:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and we /are/ providing functionality once the user starts typing.
[11:46:32] <uGoMobi> let's take this discussion to -dev
[11:46:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:47:44] <uGoMobi> so what do we say about 1.4 beta release? trying to get everything finished by tomorrow, release at Monday at latest?
