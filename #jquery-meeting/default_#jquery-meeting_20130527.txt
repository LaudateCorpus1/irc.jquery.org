[09:02:21] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf
[09:02:30] <DaveMethvin> oh i'm not authed, that's why
[09:03:41] <DaveMethvin> okay
[09:04:19] <DaveMethvin> gnarf gibson042 orkel m_gol  who else is here
[09:04:28] <gnarf> jaubourg: !
[09:04:35] <DaveMethvin> i didn't see him
[09:04:42] <DaveMethvin> oh now i di
[09:04:43] <gibson042> hi DaveMethvin et al.
[09:04:44] <DaveMethvin> do
[09:04:46] <m_gol> hi
[09:04:48] <orkel> hi
[09:04:55] <jaubourg> hey guys
[09:05:19] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit
[09:05:32] <DaveMethvin> so not bad for two releases
[09:05:50] <jaubourg> what? we didn't break the interweb?
[09:05:54] <DaveMethvin> you guys already jumped on the two animation ones
[09:06:11] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf do you think the changes to queue will trip anyone up?
[09:06:17] <DaveMethvin> good thing we didn't document it :)
[09:06:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it shouldn't - I hate doing it in a point release though
[09:06:51] <gnarf> but noone is using it yet
[09:07:08] <DaveMethvin> agreed, but if we didn't document it we don't guarantee it
[09:07:22] <gnarf> I actually think we have documented hooks.stop() already
[09:07:37] <gnarf> nope
[09:07:39] <gnarf> we haven't
[09:07:47] <gnarf> we should probably document that in 1.11/2.1
[09:07:51] * jaubourg thinks the best course of action is to never document anything
[09:07:54] <gnarf> by then it will be "stable"
[09:07:56] * jaubourg hides
[09:08:06] <DaveMethvin> it's kind of nice to let the docs be behind the code being there, for just these situations
[09:08:20] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1279 btw for those following along at homes :)
[09:08:37] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: you make it sound as if we did it on purpose (document later) :P
[09:08:46] <m_gol> ;)
[09:08:49] <DaveMethvin> OF COURSE WE DID!
[09:08:49] <gnarf> but doing it this way actually solves a bug
[09:08:55] <gnarf> that we didn't know we had in .finish()
[09:09:11] <gnarf> elem.delay(100).animate({ something: 100 }).finish()
[09:09:18] <DaveMethvin> it certainly seems more elegant the way it's done now, which is a good sign
[09:09:31] <gnarf> leaves a setTimeout( elem.dequeue.bind(elem), 100 ) on the stack
[09:10:18] <DaveMethvin> is there anything else that needs to be done? I took a quick look at tickets and a few may be real bugs but are not critical
[09:10:39] <jaubourg> there's this XHR construction options thingy
[09:10:50] <jaubourg> not vital but it's annoying for people
[09:10:52] <DaveMethvin> since we are getting a lot of dup tix i am thinking we may want a release really soon
[09:11:13] <jaubourg> problem is it will require... drumrolls, dramatic voice... """a new ajax option"""
[09:11:17] <DaveMethvin> i think the XHR construction could wait for 1.11/2.1
[09:11:30] <jaubourg> I think so too, but, hell, a new ajax option :/
[09:11:32] <DaveMethvin> since it's a feature and htere are several ways to do the thing today
[09:12:19] <DaveMethvin> so, since we're going to be together at the conf soon, i thought that might be a good time to discuss the next big release
[09:12:28] <jaubourg> +1k
[09:12:40] <m_gol> heh, people don't test betas which makes *.0 releases true betas
[09:12:54] <DaveMethvin> orkel m_gol you guys good to travel now?
[09:13:18] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah, if only my tomorrow's meeting will go well
[09:13:28] <orkel> DaveMethvin: it seems so
[09:13:34] <m_gol> I mean, if they don't decide tomorrow I'm going there to bomb Portland :P
[09:13:35] <DaveMethvin> we will sneak you across the border
[09:13:44] <m_gol> (yes, I know I shouldn't joke like that :P)
[09:13:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:14:01] <DaveMethvin> the cia is listening
[09:14:03] <DaveMethvin> and the kgb
[09:14:20] <jaubourg> m_gol: OH GN0, you said it on the interweb now you're on the WATCH LIST!!!111
[09:14:35] <DaveMethvin> they  never put Frenchmen on the watch list
[09:14:37] <DaveMethvin> :(
[09:14:41] <orkel> —Åonference starts 12 right?
[09:14:49] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin... KGB... now I know you're old :P
[09:14:54] <m_gol> conf 13, jQuery meeting 12, right?
[09:15:04] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:15:19] <DaveMethvin> should be fun
[09:15:21] <jaubourg> meeting first, conf later, kinda like the format
[09:15:28] <orkel> actually KGB still exist in Belarus :-)
[09:15:33] <DaveMethvin> we figured we would mix it up
[09:16:14] <DaveMethvin> so depending on how many people yell about the animations being broken we may release this week
[09:16:43] <DaveMethvin> i always like to give people some time so we don't end up doing a .1 .2 .3 all quickly in a row
[09:17:09] <jaubourg> it's better if we want to find out nasty regressions... or else it's a release per regression
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> let's take a quick look at what's open in the tracker
[09:17:31] <m_gol> that's what unit tests are for :)
[09:17:41] <m_gol> if we have a regression, we most probably had a test missing
[09:17:42] <DaveMethvin> unless you don't have any :)
[09:17:46] <m_gol> yup ;)
[09:17:53] <gibson042> unit tests? pshhh
[09:18:16] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13912 think this is fixed, just changed to pending
[09:18:39] <DaveMethvin> bug ajax function http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13913 :)
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> feature ajax function
[09:19:00] <DaveMethvin> you say potato
[09:19:07] <jaubourg> 13913 is a duplicate
[09:19:21] <jaubourg> it's the old "??" in data problem
[09:19:25] <DaveMethvin> cyeah
[09:19:30] <DaveMethvin> can you mark the dup?
[09:19:40] <jaubourg> need to find the original, let me handle this
[09:19:42] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13919 oh boy, a chrome bug
[09:19:59] <DaveMethvin> goes back to us using the native click
[09:20:22] <DaveMethvin> which i am now regretting
[09:20:38] <DaveMethvin> should have just closed a half-dozen bugs wontfix for 1.9
[09:20:45] <DaveMethvin> but NO
[09:22:05] <gibson042> no, I think we were right to fix the order/state
[09:22:05] <jaubourg> marked as dup: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13913#comment:1
[09:22:57] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13938 so there's already a fix on sizzle for this from orkel
[09:23:18] <DaveMethvin> i'll mark it open
[09:24:13] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, need a 1.10.1/2.0.2 milestone i guess
[09:24:17] <DaveMethvin> i'lll do that
[09:24:23] <gibson042> I thought I already created that
[09:24:56] <DaveMethvin> you did, i just found out :)
[09:25:42] <orkel> i guess 13936 will be a dup for 13938?
[09:26:30] <orkel> this bug dates for 97 commits back
[09:26:45] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah we can use 13936
[09:26:51] <DaveMethvin> i'll mark 98 as the dup
[09:27:02] <DaveMethvin> 38
[09:27:45] <orkel> don't why people did not notice it, seems as common use-case
[09:28:07] <gnarf> hey btw
[09:28:22] <gnarf> has anyone looked at johnkpaul's work with the effects unit suite and sinon?
[09:28:38] <DaveMethvin> no but i was thinking about it yesterday
[09:28:43] <DaveMethvin> don't ask me why
[09:29:00] <DaveMethvin> i was wondering if our unit tests would ever work in testswarm
[09:29:13] <DaveMethvin> the fake timers might help that
[09:29:20] <gnarf> he's gotten pretty far, and I would really like to push for us to adopt this - as well as re-writing some of the trickier ajax tests to use fake XHR
[09:29:49] <m_gol> oh, and we could get rid oh php in tests then
[09:29:56] <gnarf> i know we won't be testing real xhr implementations then, so we should keep some bugs as real XHR's but the ones with tricky server responses, we could fake and get rid of the php
[09:29:59] <m_gol> mostly
[09:30:23] <gnarf> jaubourg: thoughts there?
[09:30:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah, something about the server breaks head requests in ie8 consistently
[09:30:37] <m_gol> Angular.js does sth like that, they use mocks for a lot of things, fake backend etc.
[09:30:53] <gnarf> i mean, all that matters to us is that when the xhr responds with _____ we do _____ yeah?
[09:31:03] <gnarf> the fact that it's a real/fake XHR shouldn't bug us?
[09:31:07] <DaveMethvin> m_gol the diff there is that they are farther away from the metal so they care less about the actual responses and bugs
[09:31:15] <jaubourg> not sure it's such a good idea to remove server code from ajax tests because we need to test to whole back and forth. What I think it that we should reconsider something like jhp
[09:31:39] <DaveMethvin> if we could run a really bare bones node server that would be great
[09:31:42] <gnarf> jaubourg: so, i kind of disagree here, the unit we are testing is jQuery, not server communications
[09:31:54] <gnarf> the XHR responds with things we know it responds with
[09:32:05] <gnarf> using a fake one might help stability of tests
[09:32:11] <jaubourg> higher-level libs can ignore client-server hiccups and xhr peculiarities, we can't
[09:32:27] <orkel> jaubourg: +1
[09:32:30] <jaubourg> a fake one won't help us identify bugs in XHR imps we need to fix when they appear
[09:32:40] <m_gol> there's only one thing - some of our php intentionally delays responses
[09:32:48] <m_gol> hard to do things like that with mocks
[09:32:55] <gnarf> m_gol: not at all
[09:32:56] <gnarf> :)
[09:33:06] <DaveMethvin> that ends up being the prob, if everyone's XHR worked then we could just plug in our own stub
[09:33:20] <DaveMethvin> but we've got a lot of code in there to work around xhr issues
[09:33:24] <gnarf> right, but thats why I was saying, we have to test SOME things using native XHR
[09:33:28] <m_gol> gnarf: no? :)
[09:33:37] <jaubourg> I really think we'd better clean-up the php and js code of the ajax tests. I had done it but Krinkle came by, said it wasn't good and it pretty much died
[09:33:42] <DaveMethvin> gnarf right, any of our higher level stuff
[09:34:14] <gnarf> there is a smaller subset of strange responses we know we COULD get
[09:34:19] <gnarf> that we can test with fakes
[09:34:21] <m_gol> I'd like to separate test modules more properly btw
[09:34:30] <m_gol> so that custom builds don't fail tests
[09:34:43] <m_gol> better not to do both those things at the same time, jaubourg :D
[09:34:44] <DaveMethvin> speaking of that, imma post a question on that pull and close it if we aren't going to move it forward
[09:34:49] <jaubourg> gnarf: we cannot test against a fake xhr for the same reason we cannot test against a fake dom... because we never know when and where a browser will introduce a regression
[09:35:01] <jaubourg> m_gol: they're deeply connected
[09:35:45] <m_gol> jaubourg: yeah, I mean more ifs
[09:36:19] <m_gol> jaubourg: if (module sth present) {check this; check that;}
[09:36:37] <m_gol> after all that's what testing custom builds is about :)
[09:37:09] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg thoughts on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13927 ?
[09:38:22] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: Callbacks is a low-level object that already does a lot. The notion of Promise is alien to it and if you wanted to do something like this, you'd just create an object with the methods you wanted publicized
[09:38:27] <jaubourg> if that makes sense
[09:38:47] <gnarf> i agree with jaubourg there
[09:38:50] <jaubourg> methods are detachable in Callbacks and Deferreds
[09:38:56] <DaveMethvin> i'm fine with that, can you comment and close?
[09:39:01] <jaubourg> sure
[09:39:21] <gnarf> wontfix --- function cbPromise( callbacks ) { return { add: callbacks.add, remove: callbacks.remove }; };
[09:39:55] <gnarf> i mean, its easy to do yourself - and it's not really a "promise" either :)
[09:40:39] <DaveMethvin> gnarf gibson042 orkel is this perhaps a dup? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13940
[09:41:03] <DaveMethvin> no test case
[09:41:55] <m_gol> I say let's close as a dup, if that's not the case, they'll comment on it
[09:43:15] <jaubourg> guys, I'm sorry but I gotta fly
[09:43:35] * jaubourg closed the Callbacks bug with an explanation
[09:43:52] <jaubourg> cya around, I'll try and get on IRC more often
[09:45:22] <DaveMethvin> alright, i think we have all this under control then
[09:45:49] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 gnarf ga and land that finish() fix when you're satisfied
[09:46:27] <DaveMethvin> and let's plan on having a release late this week or early next, definitley before we all meet in Portland
[09:46:38] <DaveMethvin> thanks everyone!
[09:49:23] <m_gol> +m?
[09:51:42] <m_gol> gnarf: +m? :)
