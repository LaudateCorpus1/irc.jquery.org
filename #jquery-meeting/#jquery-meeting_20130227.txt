[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov ngsilverman petersendidit tj_vantoll
[09:01:14] <Dave_Stein> hey
[09:01:16] <tj_vantoll_phone> To
[09:01:21] <petersendidit> hey
[09:01:41] <mikesherov> hi
[09:01:46] <tj_vantoll_phone> Yo that is
[09:02:40] <kborchers> here
[09:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> Let's get started.
[09:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> I can't remember if we discussed keeping the base theme last week.
[09:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> on the CDN
[09:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> If we did, I didn't take any notes about it :-P
[09:03:47] <tj_vantoll_phone> Don't think we did.
[09:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> Just checked logs, we didn't.
[09:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> So, we've got all the pre-built themes on the CDNs.
[09:04:12] <scott_gonzalez> But the base theme is also there.
[09:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> And has a different directory structure than the built themes.
[09:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> So it's a bit confusing.
[09:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> And nobody should really be using the base theme from the CDN.
[09:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> Smoothness is base, but actually processed through download builder.
[09:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> Are there any objections to removing base from the CDNs?
[09:06:59] <kborchers> nope
[09:07:15] <tj_vantoll_phone> Not from me.
[09:07:30] <mikesherov> no objections
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> ticket and PR count are still going down :-)
[09:09:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to remove the event option from accordion and tabs.
[09:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we should be encouraging users to activate on something other than click.
[09:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> And if they really want to, they can easily build the functionality they want by setting the active option.
[09:11:48] <tj_vantoll_phone> Again seems reasonable.
[09:12:04] <mikesherov> I wish we had a way to know what users are using
[09:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> That would definitely be useufl.
[09:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> But even for our demos, we couldn't come up with anything to use other than mouseover/hoverintent.
[09:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> And that's not really great UX.
[09:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> And even when you use one of those, you still want click to activate.
[09:14:07] <ngsilverman> (hi)
[09:14:36] <mikesherov> fair enough
[09:14:40] <mikesherov> I'm just thinking out loud
[09:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. It'd definitely be easier to make these decisions knowing actual usage.
[09:16:59] <gnarf> unicorns...
[09:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer said he was in favor of removing them as well (before the meeting).
[09:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> So unless anyone objects, I'll mark them for deprecation in 1.11.
[09:17:34] <gnarf> i think as long as we show the way you described with the activate option
[09:17:42] <gnarf> er active
[09:17:44] <gnarf> we should be fine
[09:18:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is that purely a documentation deprecation, or would it move behind the backCompat flag?
[09:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> back compat
[09:18:19] <jzaefferer> ps: I'm here now
[09:19:48] <jzaefferer> anyway, still fine with me
[09:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> back compat = more work for us, but easier testing for users and an easy escape for users who still want it after we remove it
[09:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to interactions
[09:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman sent a massive PR for sortable
[09:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had time to review it yet :-(
[09:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> Also haven't had time to look at all the commits form Dave_Stein.
[09:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> But after the conference this weekend, I should have time.
[09:22:10] <Dave_Stein> yeah we're busy bees and you're bogged down
[09:22:14] <Dave_Stein> :D
[09:22:44] <Dave_Stein> it's okay cause i haven't had time for event stuffs asiode from a couple of hours monday, and at this rate i wont be able to for 2 weeks... i'll be gone next weds-sat
[09:22:57] <Dave_Stein> and im overloaded at work because of the vacation i forgot i was taking... luxury problems?
[09:23:14] <Dave_Stein> so if you take your time im okay for now.. but ngsilverman might not be heh
[09:23:19] <ngsilverman> I think everything that isn't backcompat works, save for 'accept' which I haven't started on
[09:23:31] <ngsilverman> but like I said the other day I'd like to get pointers before I go on
[09:23:51] <Dave_Stein> yeah it would suck to code down the wrong path and have to rewrite
[09:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman: I promise to review next week.
[09:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> Same for Dave_Stein
[09:24:07] <ngsilverman> ok :)
[09:24:15] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: how'd the tests for droppable go? did you figure out why my test helpers were broken in master but not interactions?
[09:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> I wasn't expecting to be giving a keynote for this conf.
[09:24:28] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: no
[09:24:40] <Dave_Stein> that's upsetting for both of us eh
[09:24:47] <mikesherov> I will figure it out
[09:24:54] <mikesherov> I'm just getting ramped up though again
[09:25:01] <mikesherov> so still sorting out all the pending work
[09:25:09] <Dave_Stein> kk like i said ill be a little slower so you have time to catch up
[09:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> I also haven't had any time at night, busy building walls in the basement.
[09:25:38] <Dave_Stein> right now im putting my website INTO photoshop so lots of late nights here this week
[09:26:27] <Dave_Stein> so anything else about interactions?
[09:26:47] <jzaefferer> Paul?
[09:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> Paul Bakaus appeared out of the blue and said he's going to help with interactions :-)
[09:26:57] <jzaefferer> Paul!
[09:27:04] <Dave_Stein> that's the original interactions paul guy right
[09:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:27:10] <jzaefferer> yep
[09:27:15] <Dave_Stein> he's at zynga still?
[09:27:24] <jzaefferer> I think so.
[09:27:35] <Dave_Stein> interesting
[09:27:45] <mikesherov> only other thing I have about interactions is still working on the master test suite against master
[09:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, he's a CTO at Zynga.
[09:28:10] <Dave_Stein> thought so
[09:28:57] <mikesherov> "a CTO"?? Isn't the definite article here more appropriate?
[09:29:10] <jzaefferer> btw I intend to get back to Selectmenu in the next days. Felix is taking care of the issues reported in wiki comments, I want to nail down the screenreader support
[09:29:20] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: "CTO of Zynga Germany" afaik
[09:29:24] <mikesherov> OH
[09:29:26] <mikesherov> Right
[09:29:30] <mikesherov> a CTO
[09:30:14] <tj_vantoll_phone> I'll try to make a triage pass of the interactions due to the activity as I have time.
[09:30:38] <Dave_Stein> so does he want to help with 2.0 or continued fixes to 1.* or what
[09:31:53] <jzaefferer> 2.0 stuff!
[09:32:05] <mikesherov> Yeah, AFAIK I'm the only one working on 1.0
[09:32:14] <jzaefferer> actually he just said he wants to help, but it makes sense to focus on the interactions branch
[09:32:22] <mikesherov> and only because I want to keep the community involved, and acquire more tests :-)
[09:32:49] <Dave_Stein> haha
[09:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, definitely 2.0
[09:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of 2.0
[09:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> I want to change 2.0 to 1.13.
[09:33:07] <mikesherov> YES
[09:33:14] <kborchers> o_O
[09:33:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: why you gotta mess with my talk
[09:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> My original plan was to not have back compat for 2.0
[09:33:37] <mikesherov> right, major vs. minor
[09:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> Since mikesherov and Dave_Stein told me not to be a dick like that, we should do a 1.x release with interaciton rewrites.
[09:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> And 2.0 should be no back compat for anything.
[09:34:07] <Dave_Stein> aren't there only 5 interaction widgets and now we'll have 4 people on it?... me, ngsilverman , mikesherov , and Paul? not sure how we're gonna distribute the tasks but I guess you'd have a plan for that scott_gonzalez
[09:34:26] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: what about the features we arent doing backcompat for?
[09:34:42] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: those still get into 1.13
[09:34:55] <mikesherov> but only because they are bad practices
[09:35:01] <mikesherov> whereas 2.0 is about complexity
[09:35:06] <Dave_Stein> so we want iframefix to still be an option in 1.13??
[09:35:13] <mikesherov> no
[09:35:17] <mikesherov> let me back up
[09:35:30] <mikesherov> things that are not being backCompatted should still be cut from 1.13
[09:35:54] <mikesherov> because they are bad practices or no longer apply
[09:35:58] <jzaefferer> we're not too serious about semver anyway
[09:35:58] <Dave_Stein> ah ok
[09:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> Right, because we're doing back compat, we should be treating this the same as any other 1.x release with API changs.
[09:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> Starting with 2.0.0, we'll follow semver for real.
[09:36:15] <Dave_Stein> makes sense to me
[09:36:18] <jzaefferer> btw. if anyone gets bored, work on datepicker
[09:36:18] <mikesherov> right, so we deprecate now
[09:36:24] <Dave_Stein> semver?
[09:36:29] <mikesherov> semantic versioning
[09:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> http://semver.org/
[09:36:39] <Dave_Stein> ah
[09:36:48] <Dave_Stein> i saw scott shooting down everything this one guy was trying to do to datepicker cause it was bad haha
[09:36:53] <Dave_Stein> i'd work on that too if we settledon future api
[09:36:56] <mikesherov> right, we can deprecate the handful of stuff we're cutting for 1.13 now
[09:37:05] <kborchers> jzaefferer: s/get's bored/wants a "challenge"  :P
[09:37:11] <mikesherov> and then just cut it as part of 1.13
[09:37:37] <mikesherov> but for the real bridge burning, we go 2.0
[09:38:31] <jzaefferer> kborchers: datepicker consists of at least three somewhat distinct components: UI, calendar logic, globalize. Any of those is up for the taking
[09:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so is everyone on board with this?
[09:38:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: are you summing up this version stuff somewhere so i can update my talk later since i refer to 2.0 a few times and i'd like to explain all of this
[09:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, let me summarize here to make sure we're all on the same page.
[09:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> We've been doing all the API redesigns in 1.x releases.
[09:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> With back compat for 1 major version.
[09:39:23] <Dave_Stein> kborchers what conference am i missing right now?
[09:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> We will continue to follow that pattern until EVERYTHING has gone through API redesigns.
[09:39:31] <mikesherov> hooray
[09:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> When we drop the last of the back compat, we will be at 2.0.0.
[09:39:36] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: this weekend jQuery Toronto
[09:39:44] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah thats right
[09:39:50] <Dave_Stein> mike mentioned that other day i forgot :P
[09:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> Once we reach 2.0.0, we'll start following semver.
[09:40:03] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I love that idea
[09:40:12] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what about datepicker? There's no way to provide a backwards compatible API there, right?
[09:40:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: makes sense to me and i agree. thanks
[09:40:42] <Dave_Stein> ugh datepicker boy do i hate you
[09:41:03] <mikesherov> well, it's not even a WIDGET
[09:41:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm not sure how much back compat we can do for datepicker without really bending the implementation.
[09:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with having no or little back compat for datepicker.
[09:41:46] <jzaefferer> even in a 1.x release?
[09:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think so.
[09:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, it may actually fall all the way to 2.0 just because we havne't been making progress on it.
[09:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> And finishing Globalize seems like a big task.
[09:43:05] <kborchers> i think it would make sense for datepicker to just move to 2.0
[09:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be ok with interactions being higher priority than datepicker.
[09:43:33] <tj_vantoll_phone> I like that as well.
[09:44:13] <jzaefferer> Well, since interactions are covered pretty well, it would be nice to have people take care of at least Globalize (or parts of that) and the calendar logic (date.js in the datepicker branch). The latter is similar to Globalize, as it has no UI and can be nicely unit tested.
[09:44:34] <mikesherov> Yeah, I think that makes sense too. It does mean though, that we should have an API redesign call for datepicker sooner rather than later, because I'll want to know what bugs we should be going after in that rat's nest in the meantime
[09:44:36] <ngsilverman> what's Globalize?
[09:45:05] <jzaefferer> ngsilverman: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/ a lib for date and number formatting and parsing
[09:45:16] <ngsilverman> thanks
[09:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> That code was all written by Microsoft.
[09:45:35] <jzaefferer> ngsilverman: the big and most important task there is to adopt CLDR as the culture (aka locale) database: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/128
[09:45:36] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #128 by jzaefferer (4mon 1w ago): Evaluate CLDR as database for cultures
[09:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> The data comes from .NET
[09:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> But we want to change the data source to CLDR.
[09:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, what jzaefferer said :-)
[09:45:57] <mikesherov> datepicker has 43 open bugs, and we'll want to improve that rather than wait till 2.0. So at least a prelim call to discuss what would get cut in 2.0.0 makes sense
[09:46:17] <mikesherov> or is that way too premature?
[09:46:28] <jzaefferer> this is frustrating: http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/2733#comment:23 I don't know who "mark" is or where the code landed some supposedly was implemented
[09:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sure, that discussion will take a long time though. Just FYI.
[09:46:50] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: over drinks at the conference?
[09:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad jzaefferer won't be there.
[09:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> We can pull in rworth.
[09:47:06] <mikesherov> Skype?
[09:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> We've already done this.
[09:47:08] <kborchers> count me in on that convo
[09:47:12] <mikesherov> kborchers: woo
[09:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> And lost all the notes :-(
[09:47:18] <mikesherov> drunk API redesign!
[09:47:24] <kborchers> \o/
[09:47:25] <jzaefferer> flash cage!
[09:47:31] <jzaefferer> and Kaiserschmarn
[09:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> Vienna was hours and hours of heated debate over APIs.
[09:47:40] <rworth> tafel shpitz
[09:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> It was awesome.
[09:47:48] <mikesherov> Yeah, well, we should get it all up in the wiki like we did for interactions
[09:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:47:57] <jzaefferer> rworth: Tafelspitz
[09:48:16] <rworth> jzaefferer: flush cache ;)
[09:48:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: interrupted by misunderstandings about "peperoni"?
[09:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, one more thing about interactions...
[09:49:31] <scott_gonzalez> Dropping IE7 support.
[09:49:47] <jzaefferer> In general? Or just for interactions?
[09:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> In general.
[09:49:57] <Dave_Stein> thats always good news
[09:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming it's going to take 9-12 months to get there.
[09:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.akamai.com/html/io/io_dataset.html#stat=browser_ver&top=5&type=line&start=20120601&end=20130223&net=both
[09:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> IE7 is ~8% usage.
[09:50:14] <jzaefferer> Seems sane, now that IE10 is coming to Win7. And IE8 is the annoying bugger that's not going away...
[09:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> Dropping about 4% per year.
[09:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> So the plan would be to drop IE7 support with 1.13.
[09:51:02] <scott_gonzalez> Which means anythign in the interactions branch can assume that IE7 doesn't exist.
[09:51:07] <kborchers> +1
[09:51:08] <jzaefferer> IE9 more popular than IE8? That's unusual
[09:51:17] <mikesherov> So, Akamai has some good stats there. Other data points, like GA for my website, or gs.statscounter.com suggest even lower
[09:51:19] <ngsilverman> so what needs updating for Globalize is the whole cultures folder basically?
[09:51:21] <jzaefferer> Recent stats I've seen where the other way round
[09:51:54] <mikesherov> for my site it's 23% of 27%
[09:52:08] <Dave_Stein> i g2g.. talk soon
[09:52:09] <tj_vantoll_phone> IE8 is the highest available on XP and XP's stats are still pretty high.
[09:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: For which browser? IE7?
[09:52:18] <mikesherov> yes
[09:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> So that's 6%
[09:52:41] <scott_gonzalez> Which is lower than the 8% from akamai.
[09:52:42] <mikesherov> wait, sorry wrong
[09:52:47] <mikesherov> looking at the wrong thing
[09:53:08] <tj_vantoll_phone> Now that Microsoft is auto updating I think it makes sense to drop 7.
[09:53:14] <mikesherov> it's more like 1.5% for my site
[09:53:19] <tj_vantoll_phone> In 1.13 that is.
[09:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, IE7 usage is pretty low.
[09:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> I mean lots of places dropped IE7 support a while ago.
[09:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> Like Google.
[09:53:56] <mikesherov> For my site, it's about 1.6% of total visits
[09:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> But I want to continue supporting for a bit longer.
[09:54:04] <mikesherov> and dropping about .1% a month
[09:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so you'll be <1% by the time 1.13 ships.
[09:54:35] <mikesherov> Well, Google technically dropped IE8 when IE10 came out for Win7
[09:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> oh, really?
[09:55:03] <jzaefferer> statcounter has IE7 at <1%, if you look at the "Browser Version (Partially Combined)" graph
[09:55:10] <mikesherov> well, they have Major-1 support, right?
[09:55:22] <mikesherov> yeah, statcounter suggests way lower
[09:55:26] <tj_vantoll_phone> We just dropped 6 so I think it's sensical to wait before we drop 7.
[09:55:29] <mikesherov> Akamai includes China
[09:55:48] <mikesherov> My site has almost no Chinese visitors
[09:55:59] <mikesherov> and statounter doesn't really either
[09:56:23] <mikesherov> netstats and akamai both apply weightings
[09:56:41] <mikesherov> which I've been calling BS on for years, but it is what it is
[09:56:55] <mikesherov> either way, I'm fine with waiting till 1.13 to drop IE7
[09:57:06] <mikesherov> it's got pretty much all the same bugs as IE8
[10:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[10:02:09] <mikesherov> clip effects and effects is where it was at a few weeks back, which is that I have all the code converted over but some failing tests
[10:02:29] <mikesherov> and I'll fix all of them at the conference
[10:03:13] <mikesherov> then I want to write some new tests for them, because like some of the other files, effects has very very little coverage
[10:03:27] <mikesherov> but that's really it
[10:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[10:04:12] <mikesherov> For button, we should reach out to Ult_Combo
[10:04:31] <mikesherov> he has a pretty significant PR out there with tests that I told him to wait till 1.11 on
[10:04:57] <mikesherov> other than that, I'm not involved
[10:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Think we should wait a few more days for that sortable PR or just write the tests?
[10:05:55] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm trying to find time to write all the tests.
[10:06:06] <mikesherov> If he doesn't get them by then, we'll just write them
[10:06:24] <mikesherov> I'm really waiting till nighttime at the conference to bang out interactions tests
[10:06:25] <mikesherov> there
[10:06:36] <mikesherov> there's so much to do
[10:07:34] <ngsilverman> I have a question about Globalize, where's the tool that pulls data from .NET located?
[10:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman: Not sure, but we don't want to use it anymore.
[10:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> We want to pull data from CLDR.
[10:08:19] <ngsilverman> understood, which brings me to my second question
[10:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> I would assume it's this though: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/master/generator
[10:09:00] <ngsilverman> say I were to write a tool to pull the data from CLDR's XML, would there be a language of choice that you'd like me to use?
[10:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> node.js
[10:09:19] <ngsilverman> ok
[10:09:30] <ngsilverman> but I don't know javascript
[10:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[10:09:46] <ngsilverman> kidding
[10:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> I know :-)
[10:09:52] <ngsilverman> I think I might give globalize a go
[10:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great.
[10:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's everything. We'll continue any other discussions in -dev.
[10:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[10:59:19] <gnarf> adding topics on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUfGj8dQH3Q4JoBOlNnfDFrESzMt6LhktXsmtPYocXI/edit
[11:01:04] <gnarf> ryanneufeld Krinkle clarkbox danheberden mikesherov scott_gonzalez - infra?
[11:01:07] <gnarf> not a ton to talk about
[11:01:15] <gnarf> clark got the splunk issues sorted
[11:01:20] <ryanneufeld> pong
[11:01:39] <gnarf> though, (mt) is going to be shutting off that server, they will be migrating us, so the IP will be changing - cc clarkbox
[11:01:44] <danheberden> it's amazing that jq01 serves 3 terabytes of stuff a month
[11:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> wow
[11:02:11] <gnarf> yup
[11:02:18] <gnarf> OVER 3tb
[11:02:24] <danheberden> heh
[11:02:31] <gnarf> cuz thats when we get the "bandwidth overage" notice
[11:02:39] <gnarf> that we are supposed to ignore
[11:02:47] <danheberden> 34 megs a second
[11:02:48] <Krinkle> Hi
[11:02:50] <danheberden> is my math right on that?
[11:03:27] <danheberden> no it isnt
[11:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> no
[11:03:32] <gnarf> 1.15
[11:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> ~73 per minute
[11:03:42] <danheberden> haha
[11:03:44] <danheberden> there we go
[11:04:04] <danheberden> that's nuts
[11:04:09] <gnarf> peaks of 3 or 4 mb a sec
[11:04:10] <gnarf> you can look at the graphs
[11:04:31] <ryanneufeld> nice
[11:04:55] <gnarf> though there is a silly peak in the graph today
[11:04:56] <gnarf> :/
[11:04:57] <gnarf> hate that
[11:05:09] <gnarf> its like some counter loops
[11:05:12] <gnarf> and you get a huge number
[11:05:13] <gnarf> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=b55f002de3884719&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10055&graphid=406
[11:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: You forgot to divide by number of days in the month :-P
[11:05:20] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i did indeed
[11:05:46] <gnarf> those are megabytes
[11:05:48] <gnarf> not bits
[11:05:58] <ryanneufeld> We do about 25M on each of 6 servers :P
[11:06:13] <gnarf> bytes?
[11:06:45] <gnarf> so
[11:06:51] <gnarf> also, zabbix notifications enabled
[11:06:56] <gnarf> seems mostly sane this afternoon?
[11:07:16] <gnarf> i think i tamed it to things we should probably be concerned about
[11:07:36] <gnarf> also, i want to sit with people and show em zabbix dashboard and how we can use it
[11:07:51] <gnarf> that thing with jq03
[11:07:59] <gnarf> so, everything there has been slow
[11:08:04] <gnarf> swarm, view
[11:08:10] <gnarf> jenkins
[11:08:15] <gnarf> we might be asking too much of it
[11:08:22] <gnarf> but i think view could be a big part of it
[11:08:29] <gnarf> lots of useless disk
[11:08:39] <gnarf> and if you catch it right, and try to ssh in
[11:08:47] <gnarf> it's like you caught it thinking
[11:08:51] <gnarf> you wait.......
[11:09:08] <gnarf> so, i'm working on rewriting that right now in node
[11:09:18] <gnarf> slightly optimized to only fetch changes
[11:09:18] <gnarf> also
[11:09:23] <gnarf> be able to build
[11:09:36] <gnarf> cc DaveMethvin toddmparker gseguin
[11:09:52] <gnarf> so it can run grunt, or whatever in the folder after a checkout
[11:10:12] <gnarf> hope to try deploying it tonight
[11:10:20] <gnarf> or later today
[11:11:05] <danheberden> sounds sensible
[11:13:13] <gnarf> We need to make sure we hash out a few hours of infra overview this weekend
[11:13:18] <gnarf> everyones there right?
[11:13:45] <gnarf> I hope you all have a lot of questions
[11:13:48] <gnarf> :)
[11:14:08] <gnarf> anyone know if clarkbox will be in toronto?
[11:14:15] <ryanneufeld> he's my roomate
[11:14:19] <ryanneufeld> so yes
[11:14:33] <gnarf> cool, i got danheberden we think
[11:14:35] <gnarf> :)
[11:14:45] <ryanneufeld> At least I assume its him since I only have a first name, and I don't know of any other clarks
[11:14:56] <danheberden> only first name would definitely be him
[11:14:57] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: bring earplugs dude, I snore like a lawnmower
[11:16:57] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: some training on zabbix would be nice.
[11:17:13] <ryanneufeld> Also a topology diagram could be useful for review
[11:17:22] <gnarf> whiteboard
[11:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> If you can get one of those computers from the Matrix, I'd like a dump of the infra team's collective shell scripting knowledge.
[11:19:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sadly, i'd like a dump of that too
[11:19:21] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure we're even on bash tricks
[11:19:39] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I'll take sloppy seconds on that one dude
[11:19:48] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: trade you for all you know on node
[11:19:56] <gnarf> Lets take the rest of the meeting to talk about stuff we want to talk about/do in toronto
[11:20:17] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I still owe a backupscript for plugins
[11:20:43] <gnarf> yeah, i've been rsyncing the folders by hand every now and then
[11:20:59] <ryanneufeld> perhaps we should discuss current backup solutions, disaster plans and go over things like (mt) control panel
[11:21:13] <gnarf> i really want to talk about a good backup solution, perhaps we can get a service
[11:22:01] <ryanneufeld> indeed, and I think a better solution than dropbox is needed for all the misc files we have
[11:24:27] <gnarf> I really want to get with the testing guys
[11:24:39] <gnarf> and see if we can figure out a way to get everything we want from something like travis
[11:25:20] <ryanneufeld> mhmm
[11:25:32] <ryanneufeld> could someone give me a rundown as well of how all the new sites templates work?
[11:26:01] <ryanneufeld> I've not had time to go through it on my own, and if someone could take me through getting the dev envirionments setup, it would be useful
[11:26:21] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: jquery-wp-content is a multi-site wordpress, it routes based on domain, instructions for that on the readme, and assistance in -content
[11:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> ryhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[11:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> The README should have all the steps
[11:26:42] * ryanneufeld looks
[11:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> (this is a pefect opportunity to update the README if it's not clear/missing any steps)
[11:27:32] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: yeah, I'll take a look
[11:28:04] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin and I were talking at the summit about building a VM for Windows lusers that won't easily have all the tools at hand
[11:28:14] <gnarf> we should maybe talk about that talk scott_gonzalez
[11:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:28:40] <gnarf> i think clarkbox wanted to talk about splunk
[11:28:42] <gnarf> also
[11:28:51] <gnarf> not sure what all you were thinking
[11:29:11] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: honestly
[11:29:21] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: if you wanted to work on a Vagrantfile for jquery-wp-content
[11:29:22] <gnarf> :)
[11:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I was thinking big picture, so splunk would fit in.
[11:30:09] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I understood the words you used just then, just not the way you put them together
[11:30:27] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: might be nice to just have vagrant up
[11:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know how detailed he wanted to get? Like 5 minutes? 10 minutes? 20 minutes?
[11:30:33] <gnarf> in jquery-wp-content
[11:30:37] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yeah
[11:30:37] <gnarf> that had the whole thing
[11:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a LOT of infrastructure :-)
[11:30:38] <ryanneufeld> that's the plan
[11:30:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, no clue
[11:30:59] <ryanneufeld> we have a lot of infra
[11:31:07] <ryanneufeld> but for people wanting to contrib
[11:31:13] <ryanneufeld> a smaller subset of what we use would be useful
[11:31:18] <ryanneufeld> and less intimidating
[11:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> I think site deployments will probably be the most interesting since they touch on a lot of our tools.
[11:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> But other things like view., download builder, etc.
[11:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> would be interesting as well
[11:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to see how much time we have and how detailed we want to get.
[11:32:11] <gnarf> as interesting as notifier is
[11:32:15] <gnarf> i kinda don't wanna mention it
[11:32:25] <gnarf> or at least if i do
[11:32:38] <gnarf> i really gotta do some pondering on the possible holes
[11:32:44] <gnarf> cuz i'm sure there is one
[11:32:59] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I would go with a hand wavy explanation of that
[11:33:28] <ryanneufeld> if you don't think it's ready for primetime, hold off getting too detailed until it is
[11:34:03] <gnarf> so, you could deploy an old site with some clever json
[11:34:07] <gnarf> thats one hole
[11:34:08] <gnarf> :)
[11:34:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you know if github offers a way to verify a json packet?
[11:35:02] <gnarf> or would we have to fetch/double check
[11:36:44] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you can do any verification.
[11:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to be safe, you can verify that the SHA points to a tag and that tag date is newer than the currently checked out tag's date.
[11:38:43] <gnarf> do they publish the IP's of the push servers?
[11:38:43] <gnarf> could we restrict on ip?
[11:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose that could break with a lightweight tag if we tried to roll back to a known good state.
[11:39:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if you're going to mess with us, you'd just fake the IP, right?
[11:39:43] <gnarf> yeah
[11:43:05] <ryanneufeld> also, once noticed, we could easily un-do right?
[11:44:49] <gnarf> I hope our hotel has decent wifi
[11:45:32] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[11:45:41] <ryanneufeld> I need to check w/ Rogers about data
[11:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> We can require signed tags for deploys.
[11:46:15] <scott_gonzalez> Then it'd be easy to verify the input.
[11:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> But it would also require everyone having a proper setup for signing.
[11:46:39] <ryanneufeld> woot, I should have LTE in Toronto, so there's that
[11:47:02] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: well, who's going to be in charge of deploying things?
[11:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov and I also have jetpacks.
[11:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: It varies by site.
[11:47:19] <ryanneufeld> for plugins. I can see signing being hard
[11:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[11:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> Very few people deploy plugins.
[11:47:43] <ryanneufeld> I mean the automatic adding of plugins
[11:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> It's like me, gnarf and sometimes ajpiano.
[11:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> Those aren't deploys.
[11:47:57] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins site has its own crazy setup :-)
[11:48:17] <ryanneufeld> so the idea of deployers having to sign commits isn't a bad one
[11:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> It'd just require every deployer setting the git and npm configs properly.
[11:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's just one setting each.
[11:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'd have to look into it.
[11:49:06] <ryanneufeld> 1-10 how hard?
[11:49:21] <ryanneufeld> 10 being
[11:49:25] <ryanneufeld> `k this stuff
[11:49:25] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: (╯°□°）╯︵ɟɟnʇs sıɥʇ
[11:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'd guess 1 or 2.
[11:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> You're asking for individual deployers, not for us writing the verification script, right?
[11:49:58] <ryanneufeld> yes
[11:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'd guess 1 or 2.
[11:50:12] <gnarf> still we would need the other logic to compare with the current version, etc yeah?
[11:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Well, if we want to get really paranoid, yes.
[11:50:35] <ryanneufeld> maybe we hire hubot?
[11:50:43] <mikesherov> Oh man, I thought we were talking about REAL jetpacks
[11:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, we can do a simple check like signed tag + tag created <1 day ago
[11:50:48] <mikesherov> that would be far more exciting
[11:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Maybe we can build a rotorcycle.
[11:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> They don't seem too complicated :-)
[11:51:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: would that require a checkout in the notifier?
[11:51:31] <gnarf> i guess we could api it
[11:51:43] <gnarf> but then ick for private repos
[11:51:45] <gnarf> ...
[11:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, I'd have to investiage.
[11:51:59] <gnarf> why no "verify" url github....
[11:52:15] <gnarf> maybe we just beg github for a verify? :)
[11:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Well, gnarf, the notificer has the repo, right?
[11:52:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not really
[11:52:28] <gnarf> it just knows a pattern and a shell script
[11:52:34] <gnarf> the shell script knows where the repo lives
[11:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> So the conern is about the shell script being secure, not the notifier, right?
[11:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> The notifier is essentially dumb and secured by the config?
[11:53:30] <gnarf> yeah, and then the only real check i think it does is that the sha is hex
[11:53:39] <gnarf> to avoid escapes
[11:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so then the check can happen in the shell script.
[11:53:52] <gnarf> sure
[11:54:03] <scott_gonzalez> Which has access to the repo, so it can check the date.
[11:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> And run a verify.
[11:54:38] <ryanneufeld> indeed it could
[11:55:17] <gnarf> seems sane
[11:55:57] <gnarf> it could even verify that the name === the sha
[11:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> `git describe SHA` will tell you if it's signed.
[11:56:20] <gnarf> could even distribute a check-sha.sh with it
[11:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> For jquery-ui, you can try it with 1.9m1
[11:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> `git describe 1.9m1` => 1.9m1
[11:56:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, we also track "master" with this
[11:56:49] <scott_gonzalez> `git describe 1.9.0` => fatal: ...
[11:56:58] <gnarf> so i don't know about requiring signed on the master branch
[11:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you can special case master.
[11:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> You know that nobody can screw us up by deploying master to stage.
[11:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> Worst case is someone tries to DOS up.
[11:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> s/up/us/
[11:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> Which they can do even with a tag.
[11:58:14] <gnarf> thats where IP kinda helps
[11:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess we'd have the 1 day or current checkout check.
[11:58:49] <gnarf> IP, name === sha, and <1 day seem enough
[12:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well we've got plenty of time before Portland to implement that and get everyone using signed tags.
[12:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add this to my todo list.
[12:04:26] <gnarf> cool
[12:04:31] <gnarf> this meeting is long over
[12:04:35] <gnarf> -infra
