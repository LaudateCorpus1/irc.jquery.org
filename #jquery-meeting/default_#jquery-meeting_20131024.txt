[11:00:23] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:00:27] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:00:30] <gseguin> hiya
[11:00:52] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz, gseguin
[11:01:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ agcolom_ agcolom toddmparker RWhitbeck
[11:01:20] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:01:26] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:01:35] <uGoMobi> agenda/updates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koHDKspWhzadOl682F-5UURrs63kbnfPxw1nBVwxM8o/edit?usp=sharing
[11:02:07] <uGoMobi> let's start
[11:02:30] <uGoMobi> looks like we are ready for 1.4 RC release
[11:02:42] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[11:02:45] <gseguin> just say the word
[11:03:04] <uGoMobi> no open tickets anymore, besides the ones for demos
[11:03:11] <gseguin> did we fix the demo script that looks for "demo" in the url ?
[11:03:17] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:03:22] <gseguin> kewl
[11:03:39] <gseguin> so I'll be able to deploy the demo on the website
[11:04:04] <uGoMobi> yeah, that should work
[11:05:19] <uGoMobi> is the changelog up to date?
[11:05:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz ^^
[11:05:33] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog
[11:05:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think so
[11:05:38] <_|Nix|_> AFAIK
[11:05:52] <uGoMobi> I think so too
[11:06:36] <uGoMobi> I have to write a short blog post and will use the changelog for key changes
[11:07:00] <uGoMobi> shall we release today?
[11:07:16] <gseguin> I'm available
[11:07:22] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[11:07:28] <uGoMobi> no more changes after RC so we have to be sure :)
[11:07:54] <_|Nix|_> Well, whatever we find we need to change, we'll just have to do it for 1.4.1.
[11:08:05] <uGoMobi> right
[11:08:29] <_|Nix|_> I wonder ... does it make sense to start 1.4-stable right after rc.1?
[11:08:37] <uGoMobi> no
[11:08:51] <uGoMobi> we will make changes in demos
[11:09:02] <agcolom> I'm here... just finishing dinner... sorry...
[11:09:23] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[11:10:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why would you want to create the branch already?
[11:12:32] <gseguin> I'm guessing because RC is supposed to be stable
[11:12:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So we can fix things which will go into 1.4.1.
[11:12:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But it's not important.
[11:13:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can do other branches, and do PRs, and file issues.
[11:13:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Plenty of ways to avoid our forgetting.
[11:13:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:13:43] <uGoMobi> and maybe we need a RC2
[11:14:19] <uGoMobi> we also have to discuss commit messages
[11:14:27] <gseguin> unless one of us needs to start working on future release on master
[11:14:37] <gseguin> then there is no real reason to branch early
[11:14:44] <uGoMobi> so I don't want commits for 1.4.1 or 1.5 yet
[11:15:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What about commit messages?
[11:15:25] <gseguin> and even then, a feature branch should do.
[11:15:29] <uGoMobi> we are going to use same format as UI and automate the changelog
[11:16:42] <gseguin> I thought we were already doing that?
[11:16:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought we already were: "Component: Brief description. Fixes #nnn - issue title."
[11:16:54] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: heh :)
[11:17:00] <arschmitz> we are not consistant enough with it
[11:17:06] <uGoMobi> it also means we should always create a ticket for an issue (if there is none yet) and close with commit
[11:17:12] <arschmitz> and we dont always have an asscoiated message
[11:17:15] <arschmitz> lol
[11:17:26] <arschmitz> and by message i meant issue
[11:17:30] <_|Nix|_> OK, wait a sec ... so every single commit fixes an issue?
[11:17:41] <arschmitz> unless its white space or somthing
[11:18:15] <gseguin> but if you're working on a new feature that doesn't really make sense
[11:18:33] <uGoMobi> there are just some things I want to discuss in first meeting after 1.4 final release
[11:18:42] <_|Nix|_> "20:22:27 < jquicommit> jquery-ui/master 7e68945 Scott Gonz√°lez: Menu (icons demo): Removed anchors from menu items."
[11:18:42] <uGoMobi> things that should make our lives easier :)
[11:18:49] <_|Nix|_> That one didn't fix any issues ...
[11:19:07] <gseguin> ok, that would work then
[11:20:04] <uGoMobi> let's first focus on 1.4 release
[11:20:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You could spin it that way: Create an issue, label it a feature request or dev task or whatever, then submit a PR that fixes that issue.
[11:20:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... to handle new features, I mean.
[11:20:28] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: overhead
[11:20:37] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: *shrug*
[11:20:45] <arschmitz> if its a commit that should not show in change log it does not need an issue
[11:20:45] <uGoMobi> just saying I want to have a moment to discuss a couple of things about the way we work
[11:20:50] <arschmitz> this is for automating changelog
[11:20:58] <uGoMobi> not saying I want to discuss this now
[11:21:05] <gseguin> ok
[11:21:12] <gseguin> next topic then
[11:21:13] <_|Nix|_> We can talk about it in AMS.
[11:21:41] <uGoMobi> not all of us are in Amsterdam
[11:21:49] <uGoMobi> s/are/will be/
[11:22:29] <_|Nix|_> Dang ... right ...
[11:22:30] <_|Nix|_> NM ...
[11:23:00] <uGoMobi> let's talk about things we have to do before 1.4 final
[11:23:12] <uGoMobi> first things first
[11:23:32] <uGoMobi> I am working on ThemeRoller update
[11:23:47] <uGoMobi> and that's not an easy one
[11:24:00] <gseguin> I bet
[11:24:28] <uGoMobi> many people ask about the TR update
[11:24:55] <uGoMobi> so I try to get it fixed ASAP
[11:25:33] <uGoMobi> API docs update is going well
[11:25:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome work!
[11:25:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks for opening all those tickets!
[11:26:03] <arschmitz> yeah took a while to go through all the api :)
[11:26:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, thanks a lot. It's good to have a clear path.
[11:27:15] <uGoMobi> when I am done with the TR I am going to make the new web site ready
[11:27:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you work on complete changelog and updating the supported platforms list?
[11:27:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome and DB seems to be fine now have not received any complaints since i fixed
[11:28:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, great that you fixed that
[11:28:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup ill get change log on master and then we can tweak it for 1.4
[11:28:43] <arschmitz> it will still need some hand editing but should be simple compared to old ones
[11:29:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, would be great if you could clean it up a bit
[11:30:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you keep cranking on the API docs?
[11:30:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[11:30:29] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:30:54] <uGoMobi> I want to plan on releasing Mon 4 Nov
[11:31:02] <uGoMobi> when we are in Amsterdam
[11:31:43] <uGoMobi> I think we need a whole week at to get TR, docs and new web site in shape
[11:31:54] <uGoMobi> and don't want to release Friday end of the day
[11:32:11] <uGoMobi> good idea?
[11:32:20] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[11:32:23] <_|Nix|_> +1
[11:32:36] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:32:58] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss?
[11:34:00] <uGoMobi> oh, let's not forget about the open demos tickets
[11:35:04] <arschmitz> yeah ill take care of the search one and the nested listview one
[11:35:15] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:35:50] <uGoMobi> I think we can go back to -dev and get ready for RC release
[11:35:54] <uGoMobi> yiha!
[11:36:05] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:36:08] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
