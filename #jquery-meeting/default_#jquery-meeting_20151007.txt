[11:33:13] <jzaefferer> leobalter: there
[11:33:23] <leobalter> nice
[11:33:46] <leobalter> gibson042 JamesMGreene Krinkle hey!
[11:34:16] <gibson042> hi
[11:34:26] <leobalter> first thing: nested modules are ready, just need a final review on the docs (thanks @gibson042)
[11:34:56] <leobalter> with the nested modules, the 2.0 Milestone is just one feature away!
[11:35:12] <jzaefferer> What's the missing feature?
[11:35:22] <leobalter> the standard reporter interface
[11:35:54] <jzaefferer> right
[11:36:17] <leobalter> QUnit.only is not on 2.0 but it's not a blocker as well
[11:36:55] <leobalter> that leads to the question: how is js-reporters?
[11:37:03] <jzaefferer> Could do another 1.x release once nested modules land
[11:37:13] <leobalter> sure, I'll
[11:37:17] <jzaefferer> Or wait for new events
[11:37:29] <leobalter> I'm also writing a blog post about the nested modules
[11:37:52] <jzaefferer> js-reporters still suffers from zero participation from anyone outside Franzsika (who was working on it during Google Summer of Code) and me (who was mentoring her)
[11:38:20] <jzaefferer> as for progress, the Mocha adapter is almost ready, hopefully Franzsika is available sometime soon to finish that
[11:38:39] <jzaefferer> to see if we're on a good track, I'd like to integrate all three available adapters into browserstack-runner
[11:38:45] <leobalter> is there anything we can do on QUnit to support js-reporter?
[11:39:17] <jzaefferer> we can start implementing the events as currently specified: https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/#event-names
[11:39:37] <jzaefferer> js-reporters has tests for the QUnit-adapter, we should be able to run the same tests against our own implementation
[11:41:20] <leobalter> JamesMGreene: seems that we are ready to move https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/644 forward
[11:42:25] <leobalter> if JamesMGreene is busy, I can rebase his branch and continue working on top of it.
[11:42:54] <jzaefferer> well, he commented on one issue today, but otherwise has been very much unavailable
[11:43:05] <jzaefferer> 101% busy
[11:43:17] <jzaefferer> so makes sense if you'd pick up where he left it
[11:44:22] <leobalter> well, I have a question: if we integrate QUnit with js-reporters, how do I tell js-reporters the reporter I want to use?
[11:44:28] <jzaefferer> you can check https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/blob/master/lib/adapters/QUnitAdapter.js as a reference as well
[11:44:52] <jzaefferer> consider js-reporters just a specification for events and event names
[11:45:08] <jzaefferer> registering reporters is still up to each framework
[11:45:31] <jzaefferer> integrating into browserstack-runner would be a good opportunity to figure out how to standardize that part as well
[11:45:57] <leobalter> ok. I was thinking about having a tap reporter on QUnit, and it seems that qunit-tap does it really well. https://github.com/twada/qunit-tap
[11:47:06] <gibson042> sweet!
[11:47:30] <jzaefferer> It would be nice to have reporters build on top of js-reporters
[11:47:53] <jzaefferer> and/or bundle them with js-reporters: https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/tree/master/lib/reporters
[11:48:07] <leobalter> jzaefferer: yes, and we should make some as examples.
[11:48:52] <jzaefferer> Maybe integrate https://github.com/twada/qunit-tap/blob/master/lib/qunit-tap.js into https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/blob/master/lib/reporters/TapReporter.js
[11:49:14] <leobalter> sure
[11:49:32] <jzaefferer> btw. I was thinking about moving js-reporters to the jquery org on Github, and trying to get the Foundation to give it some "official" support, whatever that would look like in the end
[11:49:41] <jzaefferer> at least make some noise through blog and twitter
[11:50:02] <jzaefferer> would be nice to have at least one other framework adopt it, so that it looks less sad
[11:50:08] <jzaefferer> but I don't know how
[11:50:23] <leobalter> Mocha has tons of built ins reporters
[11:50:30] <leobalter> maybe Jasmine is a good one to start
[11:50:44] <leobalter> or even Jest
[11:51:03] <leobalter> we should write some good reporters based on js-reporters
[11:51:46] <leobalter> and see how to contribute to them to use these reporters
[11:52:08] <leobalter> I'm not 100% aware on how they work with different reporters. I've had just a brief on Mocha
[11:52:22] <leobalter> *just a brief overview on Mocha
[11:52:42] <leobalter> also: for QUnit, I'm proposing this thing in order to advance on the custom reporters: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/872
[11:52:56] <jzaefferer> well, make the tapreporter in the js-reporters repo work properly, then pick a framework to implement the js-reporters interface, contribute an implementation and demo it using the existing tapreporter
[11:53:08] <jzaefferer> lots of work, but if that's what it takes...
[11:53:37] <leobalter> jzaefferer: can we have a individual repo for each reporter on js-reporters and load them as modules?
[11:54:42] <leobalter> maybe it it good to have just one default reporter built in on js-reporter
[11:55:05] <leobalter> and all the others loads js-reporter
[11:55:18] <jzaefferer> that should be possible
[11:55:43] <jzaefferer> we can start with the current structure and extra modules once we got a better idea what that will look like
[11:55:49] <leobalter> like: let's say I want to use the tap-reporter (based on js-reporter): On QUnit I will load it only.
[11:56:04] <leobalter> So I will say that reporter is compatible with Mocha, QUnit, Jasmine, etc
[11:56:32] <jzaefferer> QUnit.register(require("js-reporters/tap-reporter")
[11:56:54] <leobalter> ok
[11:56:56] <jzaefferer> Mocha.register(require("js-reporters/whutever-reporter"))
[11:57:05] <jzaefferer> (plus actually valid syntax)
[11:57:21] <jzaefferer> Mocha.register(require("custom-reporter"))
[11:57:49] <jzaefferer> dunno if register is a good name, might be fine, might be misleading, based on whatever is actually passed
[11:57:58] <jzaefferer> might also be taken in at least one framework...
[11:58:22] <leobalter> Mocha has it's own way to define a custom reporter
[11:58:37] <leobalter> on QUnit I believe it's better to stick with something at QUnit.config
[11:58:57] <leobalter> like QUnit.config.reporter( ... )
[11:59:17] <jzaefferer> I don't think that belongs on QUnit.config
[11:59:24] <jzaefferer> QUnit.on will be on the top-level as well
[11:59:31] <leobalter> sure
[11:59:58] <leobalter> I can imagine a qunit.json with configuration settings
[12:00:21] <leobalter> so that's why I'm thinking this way. QUnit.reporter is fine too
[12:00:30] <leobalter> anyway, I'll need to finish the events emitter before
[12:00:46] <leobalter> to advance on the tests for js-reporters
[12:01:06] <jzaefferer> do you have any contacts to maintainers of other test frameworks?
[12:01:14] <jzaefferer> if not, maybe someone at Bocoup can help?
[12:01:33] <leobalter> I can try, but everyone is pretty busy as well.
[12:01:55] <leobalter> I'll also take a look at the bugs, where the last one is a recent regression: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/labels/bug
[12:02:32] <jzaefferer> ok
[12:03:18] <leobalter> cool. I'm writing the meeting notes now.
[12:03:24] <jzaefferer> I still have a contract with the jQuery Foundation to work on jQuery UI, but only until the end of this month. Maybe afterwards we can make a proposal for me to get some paid time on QUnit. It would have to have a limited scope and specific goal
[12:04:46] <leobalter> I would really appreciate more of your time on QUnit.
[12:05:07] <jzaefferer> are you going to be at the Dev Summit in NYC?
[12:05:14] <leobalter> yes yes.
[12:05:17] <jzaefferer> good
[12:05:21] <leobalter> are you?
[12:05:34] <jzaefferer> Let's discuss it there, we may even be able to get a direct line to the board
[12:05:36] <jzaefferer> yeah
[12:05:48] <jzaefferer> I think we need to stop now, time for `uiteam meeting
[12:05:52] <jzaefferer> `uiteam
[12:05:53] <jzaefferer> ?
[12:05:56] <jzaefferer> meh :/
[12:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> b-ot: You're failing...
[12:06:18] <jzaefferer> ping arschmitz fnagel scott_gonzalez
[12:06:26] <jzaefferer> awayrxaviers:
[12:06:29] <arschmitz> hi
[12:06:29] <fnagel> hey
[12:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> So, button...
[12:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz and jzaefferer have pushed some updates.
[12:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> Where do we stand with that now?
[12:08:52] <jzaefferer> From my point of view, the branch only needs a rebase
[12:09:00] <jzaefferer> I've addressed everything from my last review myself
[12:09:12] <jzaefferer> With some help from Alex after I got stuck
[12:09:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i pulled your commits and rebased with master
[12:09:26] <jzaefferer> got everything working in IE8
[12:09:30] <arschmitz> but the history needs some fixing
[12:09:38] <jzaefferer> speaking of history
[12:09:45] <jzaefferer> what are we going to land in master?
[12:09:49] <jzaefferer> one commit? 100?
[12:10:03] <jzaefferer> ps: sneaky pushes are sneaky!
[12:10:13] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it was just this morning
[12:10:15] <scott_gonzalez> We're just going to amend the whole thing into whatever the HEAD commit is on master and then force push.
[12:10:30] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: sure, but I could've looked at it before the meeting if I knew
[12:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's only 55 commits right now.
[12:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> So I'd say just merge as is if it's already rebased.
[12:11:07] <arschmitz> its rebased as of this morning
[12:11:21] <arschmitz> like 2 hours ago
[12:12:15] <jzaefferer> so we just merge --fast-foward this?
[12:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> There's definitely a little commit cleanup that could happen, but I'll leave that up to arschmitz.
[12:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm more interested in seeing this in master than not seeing fixup commits.
[12:12:41] <arschmitz> yeah i can clean up and land this if everyone is good with it
[12:12:58] <arschmitz> i know what needs to be fixed
[12:13:01] <jzaefferer> what would you squash?
[12:13:11] <arschmitz> controlgroup: fixup for starts lol
[12:13:17] <arschmitz> all my own fixup commits
[12:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> He has commits that are labeled as fixup.
[12:14:00] <arschmitz> yup just minor typos and stuff from reviews that should just be squashed
[12:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you have a core.excludesfile set up?
[12:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> Because https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/dc178e8323466bc29d8cc75094b9d9207af43787 should never be an issue.
[12:14:40] <arschmitz> heh i lost it when i switched laptops but i have it back now
[12:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[12:15:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: so if your both good with this i can land it after all my meetings today
[12:15:50] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: can you push the cleaned up branch somewhere else and let me know?
[12:15:59] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[12:16:07] <jzaefferer> if we're doing that, I'd like to take a final look
[12:16:18] <arschmitz> ok
[12:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm good with it landing after jzaefferer's review.
[12:16:25] <arschmitz> ok
[12:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want another round of my review to hold anything up.
[12:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just get to that after it's in master.
[12:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> Potentially even after the beta.
[12:18:45] <jzaefferer> sounds good
[12:18:56] <jzaefferer> well,
[12:19:04] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: just squash and merge, nevermind another review from me
[12:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that brings up to datepicker.
[12:19:30] <jzaefferer> better to review my docs PRs instead of spending more time on button
[12:19:59] <arschmitz> ok
[12:20:36] <fnagel> Sorry guys, due to my relocation I had no time and no internet for almost a week. Even my mobile fallback solution did not work as there was an issue with the local cell.
[12:20:56] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[12:20:57] <arschmitz> fnagel: im moving in less then a month and dreading that
[12:21:05] <fnagel> Regarding the doodle: I'm almost up-to-date with my job duties and promise to send another doodle asap!
[12:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Do you need anything before merging https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1590 ?
[12:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:22:02] <fnagel> No, not in specific, but there are some comments I need to work on
[12:22:20] <jzaefferer> Merging master into the branch and fixing style issues should be all that's left
[12:22:30] <fnagel> seems so
[12:23:47] <fnagel> And: "Sure, as long as we get the jscs changes into the datepicker branch"
[12:24:15] <jzaefferer> yes, that's the "merge master into the branch" part :-)
[12:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> Do you need help with that?
[12:24:33] <fnagel> Not sure what needs to be done
[12:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> Just merge master into datepicker.
[12:24:53] <fnagel> Merge with master and run grunt again :-)
[12:25:09] <arschmitz> wait for button to bother with master ll
[12:25:30] <fnagel> We implemented more specific jscs rules, right?
[12:25:46] <arschmitz> we removed most of the execptions
[12:26:04] <arschmitz> but jscs also fixed some problems we are working around in the jquery preset since
[12:26:20] <arschmitz> to do with comments and something else
[12:26:25] <arschmitz> issues i had reported
[12:28:08] <fnagel> Ok, I can do that soon
[12:28:25] <fnagel> Anything else regarding calendar / datepicker?
[12:29:01] <jzaefferer> Don't think so
[12:29:13] <jzaefferer> fixing focus handling will be more interesting than fixing some style issues
[12:30:05] <fnagel> Yes. I guess that will come with some general a11y changes.
[12:31:28] <jzaefferer> alright
[12:31:36] <jzaefferer> on docs, I'm looking for reviews on my two PRs
[12:31:49] <jzaefferer> upgrade guide should be complete now: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/123
[12:32:14] <jzaefferer> and this adds button, checkboxradio and controlgroup docs: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/280
[12:32:42] <jzaefferer> fnagel: are you coming to the NYC Dev Summit?
[12:32:48] <arschmitz> ill review those after i land button
[12:34:19] <fnagel> jzaefferer: No, too much workload, espacially with this relocation chaos
[12:35:05] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: yay
[12:35:08] <jzaefferer> fnagel: gotcha
[12:35:19] <fnagel> jzaefferer: :-( I would love to
[12:35:44] <jzaefferer> fnagel: can you see which issues from the rewrite we can/should add to the list? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BAJM7nDkqiCTmYxaqThQj3LNghzPqrX2YQdvbGdxpMA/edit?ts=5613e483#heading=h.11563ywih90x
[12:37:09] <jzaefferer> I've also axed rxaviers to add to that for download builder
[12:37:19] <jzaefferer> I think that's all we have for today
[12:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, thanks everyone.
