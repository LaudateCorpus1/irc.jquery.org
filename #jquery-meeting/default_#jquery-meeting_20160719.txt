[14:00:06] <sfrisk> Chassis Meeting time
[14:00:24] <nashvail> hello!
[14:00:27] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit, nashvail, kristyjy
[14:00:27] <sfrisk> although I think kristyjy is going to be late today
[14:00:33] <sfrisk> but she does have the tables pr updated
[14:01:33] <nashvail> yes
[14:02:45] <sfrisk> one sec, I'll have the link to agenda
[14:03:00] <nashvail> don't forget to mention https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/10
[14:03:49] <sfrisk> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke2x_powoI8QnfyFtyOdeOI1ZJjL0PzAy9oXgyUYXb8/edit?usp=sharing
[14:07:06] <sfrisk> first up is the updated table pr https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/151/files
[14:07:45] <sfrisk> which adds the full table option
[14:11:11] <nashvail> scss/variables/tables.js has "border-color" set as #eee wouldn't it be better to pull colors from the pallette?
[14:14:31] <sfrisk> hrm good point
[14:14:38] <sfrisk> do you want to add a note about that on the PR?
[14:14:46] <nashvail> sure
[14:15:14] <sfrisk> should hook in the "default" variable by default
[14:15:54] <geekman-rohit> Hey
[14:16:48] <nashvail> default - dark is #eee
[14:17:06] <sfrisk> okay, make a note to include that
[14:17:08] <sfrisk> good catch
[14:18:54] <sfrisk> I think after that thing, it should be good
[14:19:31] <nashvail> üëç added the note
[14:21:01] <sfrisk> awesome
[14:21:02] <sfrisk> okay
[14:21:25] <sfrisk> next up is issues: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/10
[14:21:34] <sfrisk> errrr inputs
[14:21:36] <sfrisk> with the url issues
[14:21:39] <sfrisk> so I get confused
[14:22:23] <sfrisk> scroll to the bottom and you'll get the latest designs for inputs
[14:22:39] <sfrisk> including default, disabled, focused, error
[14:23:26] <sfrisk> I assume readonly state would be similar to disabled, but might want to call that out
[14:23:36] <sfrisk> https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5c37e13d7ec539f787cf5653ca8fa1cb6e6336fb/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6b476a546b65542e706e67
[14:25:53] <nashvail> they should be similar though shouldn't they?
[14:26:11] <nashvail> just that the readonly inputs will already have some content in them
[14:26:17] <nashvail> to convery they're read only
[14:26:18] <nashvail> ?
[14:26:38] <sfrisk> yeah
[14:27:01] <sfrisk> More of a note that when for the demo, a readonly example and a disabled example should be included
[14:27:14] <nashvail> alright noted
[14:28:00] <sfrisk> but on the code side - maybe have different classes, just in case someone wants to change varaibles to be different for readonly
[14:28:04] <sfrisk> since they might
[14:28:21] <nashvail> yes I figured that üòÑ
[14:28:31] <sfrisk> :-)
[14:28:46] <sfrisk> Captain Obvious is Obvious
[14:28:57] <sfrisk> I'm captain obvious I guess
[14:29:52] <nashvail> üòÜ  So i should go forward with this design?
[14:32:17] <sfrisk> I like it, @geekman-rohit, thoughts?
[14:32:35] <geekman-rohit> Yep! We go ahead with it
[14:32:59] <geekman-rohit> Though about readonly.. does anyone know if the defauly cursor is different for the two?
[14:33:20] <geekman-rohit> The browser does not submit the data of disabled by default unlike readonly
[14:33:40] <sfrisk> "a readonly element is just not editable, but gets sent when the according form submits. a disabled element isn't editable and isn't sent on submit. another difference is that readonly elements can be focused (and getting focused when "tabbing" through a form) while disabled elements can't."
[14:33:42] <geekman-rohit> Maybe a different cursor for the two so its obvious
[14:34:01] <geekman-rohit> Yes
[14:34:16] <nashvail> there is this cursor with an abort symbol for the disabled inputs
[14:34:35] <geekman-rohit> And readonly?
[14:34:41] <nashvail> for read only .... the regular text cursor would be fine ?
[14:34:44] <nashvail> probably not
[14:34:58] <nashvail> how do the other libraries handle it?
[14:35:05] <geekman-rohit> We should leave both to default
[14:35:18] <geekman-rohit> Whatever  most browsers do by default to the two
[14:35:20] <sfrisk> I think it defaults to the I-beam text cursor
[14:35:26] <sfrisk> for read only
[14:35:31] <geekman-rohit> Yeah @sfrisk I think so too
[14:35:52] <geekman-rohit> So we do have that with our classes too
[14:36:21] <nashvail> the I-beam is the regular text cursor right?
[14:36:44] <geekman-rohit> Yeah
[14:37:06] <geekman-rohit> Nash just check what most browsers do by default
[14:37:13] <geekman-rohit> And implement that
[14:37:21] <nashvail> sure
[14:37:31] <geekman-rohit> The design is good though
[14:37:34] <geekman-rohit> +1
[14:37:34] <sfrisk> I like it
[14:38:18] <nashvail> üòÉ
[14:42:06] <sfrisk> okay, do we have anything else?
[14:42:43] <nashvail> Everything on agenda is covered
[14:43:02] <sfrisk> okay
[14:43:28] <sfrisk> so inputs and tables updated for next week - if that fix is made for tables before then, I'll pull it in
[14:43:48] <nashvail> üëç
[14:44:03] <sfrisk> okay, see everyone next week
