[09:01:14] <gnarf> AGENDA! https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AusvKVL7jmFUcHVBQk9tMUxkRGl0emVwZGdLd0QtUlE&hl=en#
[09:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> Google Docs is being super laggy for me
[09:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Anything to discuss about infrastructure?
[09:03:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: are we STILL waiting on google CDN?
[09:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[09:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> At this point we should probably just switch to using the MS CDN.
[09:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> Announcing a release over a month after it's tagged is insane.
[09:04:36] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez not really
[09:04:42] <danheberden> been waiting on (mt) and waiting
[09:05:00] <danheberden> and don't really want to spend time on this old shit vs. putting time into new shit
[09:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> When was the last time we got an update from them?
[09:06:34] <gnarf> paul_irish_:?
[09:07:16] <gnarf> danheberden: are we still interested in setting up some central monitoring / puppet deployments ?
[09:07:42] <danheberden> gnarf - definitely; i figured by this time it'd be like "hey corey, um, so i have this pile of servers and...."
[09:08:03] <danheberden> i've inquired into other providers
[09:09:15] <gnarf> paul_irish: can you please tell us why its been a month for google to put stuff on CDN? :)
[09:10:57] <paul_irish> weird.
[09:11:02] <paul_irish> must have been lost.
[09:11:15] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: it'd be totally fine to ping the thread again after 1w
[09:11:27] <paul_irish> i can do it late this afternoon
[09:11:35] <paul_irish> but scott_gonzalez, plz email
[09:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> 2 weeks later, Bryan said "I'll go ahead and publish the current release."
[09:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> Then there were the holidays.
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> It seemed like he was maybe hoping we'd rebuild the zip to include individual files
[09:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, if you can get it up today that'd be great
[09:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, kborchers: any update on selectmenu?
[09:16:06] <kborchers> i fixed the select-first issue and felix is happy with it
[09:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, clarkbox: any news on BrowserStack integration for TestSwarm?
[09:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> guess not
[09:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> menubar and popup were moved out of master so we can focus on 1.9
[09:23:41] <kborchers> do we have a list of things that need to be done before 1.9 release?
[09:23:49] <kborchers> i have tests and demos to write for menu
[09:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[09:24:22] <kborchers> oh, right. thnx
[09:26:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I pinged clarkbox earlier as well, no reply yet
[09:26:56] <jzaefferer> haven't heard anything for a while
[09:27:50] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: any word from nodejitsu of late?
[09:28:04] <jzaefferer> rworth: I checked the repo earlier, no new commits in a while
[09:28:12] <rworth> ok
[09:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> No, they're waiting on me to review the code.
[09:28:28] <jzaefferer> didn't we get them some feedback?
[09:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> We had a very short discussion which ended with me needing to dig into the code and give them actual feedback
[09:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> Which I haven't done yet.
[09:31:22] <jzaefferer> I've spend a lot more time with nodejs these last few days then ever before - could pair on that review
[09:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:32:40] <rworth> let's the three of us get together sometime
[09:32:49] <rworth> like, three dudes
[09:33:17] <gnarf> this sounds like a setup for a bad movie
[09:33:19] <jzaefferer> today?
[09:33:33] <rworth> I can do whenever this week, pretty much
[09:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> Not today.
[09:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting close to finishing the processing for the plugins site.
[09:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[09:36:07] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:36:15] <jzaefferer> don't think so
[09:36:19] <rworth> dasit
[09:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, crawling back under my plugins site rock...
[09:36:39] <gnarf> good luck
[09:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> Very much looking forward to finishing this up and getting back to focusing on UI
