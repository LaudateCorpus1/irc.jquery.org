[09:01:20] <markelog> hey-hey
[09:01:21] <markelog> meat?
[09:01:37] <timmywil> it's what's for dinner
[09:01:51] <markelog> )
[09:02:01] <timmywil> also, I bought a house today
[09:02:23] <gibson042> congratulations on your albatross :)
[09:02:28] <timmywil> thanks!
[09:02:52] <timmywil> It sure is a stressful process
[09:02:54] <markelog> congrats!
[09:02:58] <markelog> that's big
[09:04:00] <timmywil> OK, first, release retrospective. Is there anything we should change or fix for the next release?
[09:04:15] <timmywil> We probably won't mention Yandex next time
[09:04:25] <markelog> yeah, that was weird
[09:04:33] <timmywil> yea
[09:04:47] <markelog> google ppl, you know )
[09:05:03] <markelog> in any case, once was plenty
[09:05:20] <timmywil> Other than that, I think it went pretty well
[09:05:36] <markelog> feel bad about that, users should have looked at what have changed, not on such small matters
[09:05:50] <timmywil> it was nonsense
[09:05:56] <m_gol> resent
[09:05:58] <m_gol> * present
[09:06:02] <timmywil> ha
[09:06:04] <markelog> raf and promises changes had quite welcome
[09:06:05] <m_gol> sorry, I don't resent anyone
[09:06:11] <markelog> *were
[09:06:30] <timmywil> yea
[09:06:39] <markelog> show/hide weren't, but that was expected i guess
[09:06:42] <timmywil> show/hide changes are getting mixed reviews, but from what I can tell are generally favored
[09:06:53] <markelog> favored?
[09:06:59] <m_gol> I'm getting generally negative ones
[09:07:04] <markelog> me too
[09:07:08] <timmywil> where?
[09:07:14] <markelog> both in blog post comments and in github issues
[09:07:26] <m_gol> and on a Warsaw JS Facebook group
[09:07:44] <m_gol> s/Warsaw/Polish/
[09:08:02] <markelog> wow
[09:08:07] <markelog> do you have a link?
[09:08:12] <timmywil> In terms of blog comments, there are more comments favoring the changes
[09:08:24] <timmywil> and we're only going to see negative on github issues
[09:08:39] <markelog> i seen both, but more were against
[09:09:08] <markelog> it was next after the post
[09:09:12] <m_gol> almost every negative comment is explicitly about .show() not showing cascade-hidden elements, as expected
[09:09:13] <markelog> *next day
[09:09:57] <m_gol> the number of comments is not the best metric btw ;)
[09:10:05] <markelog> nothing is )
[09:10:19] <timmywil> we did get suggestions to use hidden
[09:10:22] <markelog> perhaps we need more attention? Can we ask paulirish/addy to tweet about it?
[09:10:35] <timmywil> I wonder if that's worth trying
[09:10:36] <markelog> it would be a spec violation
[09:10:44] <markelog> we can use aria-hidden
[09:10:54] <markelog> but that is another black whole
[09:10:55] <timmywil> there's an argument that it would not be
[09:11:05] <gibson042> setting hidden=true would also be inconsistent across our support range
[09:11:21] <m_gol> one issue is that the suggestion to be able to show cascade-hidden elements later is to do `.css('display', WANTED_DISPLAY).hide()` but on jQuery<3 it will trigger a reflow in the meantime
[09:11:28] <timmywil> gibson042: that's probably the reason not to
[09:11:35] <gibson042> but I expect a bug report requesting that .show sets hidden=false at some point
[09:11:58] <markelog> there is a lot of reasons
[09:12:07] <markelog> display and hidden will conflict
[09:12:11] <markelog> display will win
[09:12:22] <markelog> i don't think we can accomplish much
[09:12:25] <m_gol> cc scott_gonzalez archmitz btw, they may be interested in this discussion
[09:12:50] <timmywil> ok, well, we don't need to decide anything right now. We can ask for more feedback.
[09:13:08] <markelog> that is what we doing isn't it? :-)
[09:13:19] <timmywil> I mean again
[09:13:28] <m_gol> I remember paul_irish posted a proposal for a display-like CSS property that has just two modes - show or not show, that would be ideal ;p
[09:13:30] <markelog> i think we need to ask paul and addy
[09:13:31] <timmywil> via tweets or w/e
[09:13:40] <gibson042> for me, it's all about the bug reportsâ€”i.e., what did we _actually_ break
[09:13:50] <markelog> m_gol: that is what i have explored in my pr
[09:14:16] <m_gol> markelog: this is a separate property so it doesn't affect display in any way
[09:14:31] <timmywil> that would be nice, but wouldn't solve anything until it's implemented.
[09:14:31] <m_gol> but it's a potential future standard so won't help us currently
[09:14:34] <m_gol> yes
[09:15:12] <markelog> okay, gotcha
[09:15:38] <markelog> gibson042: cascade hidden elements do not show anything
[09:15:46] <markelog> that is one thing
[09:16:40] <timmywil> m_gol: for the Android 2.3 PRs you marked for review, did you have a specific question you'd like answered during the meeting?
[09:16:56] <m_gol> yes, do we all agree with enabling es3 on master?
[09:16:58] <markelog> and do not show anything
[09:17:00] <m_gol> in JSHint
[09:17:05] <markelog> damn, do not hide anything
[09:17:13] <markelog> that is the other
[09:17:19] <gibson042> that's not what I mean
[09:17:48] <markelog> i want to show a div, i use show() it doesn't show anything )
[09:18:13] <gibson042> so who is doing that? which packages, etc.
[09:18:13] <timmywil> markelog: I think gibson042 is saying that no one has actually opened that bug report yet
[09:18:37] <markelog> why is that?
[09:18:38] <m_gol> well, people are just commenting on the existing slideDown bug
[09:18:49] <m_gol> if it didn't exist, maybe they'd open separate ones
[09:18:59] <markelog> so we call it a bug huh?
[09:19:04] <timmywil> that bug report doesn't point us to code in the wild
[09:19:09] <markelog> jk
[09:19:10] <gibson042> this ^
[09:19:45] <markelog> i don't know, sounds like we want to ask what we already know
[09:20:13] <timmywil> perhaps, but let's move on for now
[09:20:28] <gibson042> on es3: true for master, I'm +1
[09:20:28] <markelog> like, open any plugin that shows anything
[09:20:30] <markelog> it would work
[09:20:33] <markelog> wouldn't
[09:20:44] <timmywil> gibson042: me too
[09:20:45] <markelog> that is pretty "wild" as you say )
[09:20:51] <markelog> yeah, +1
[09:20:53] <m_gol> let me express my deep distaste towards the Android 2.3 Browser
[09:21:12] <markelog> proposed to remove it from our matrix )
[09:21:14] <m_gol> I've wasted soooo many hours into making our tests not break totally on it
[09:21:27] <m_gol> I have an impression it's a growing percentage :P
[09:21:35] <m_gol> of my total jQuery involvement
[09:21:42] <markelog> that "catch" thing, should have been a hard bug to find
[09:21:56] <m_gol> well, deferred tests were completely failing ;)
[09:22:08] <m_gol> because of a parse error on the whole file
[09:22:19] <timmywil> I'm fine with this too https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2458
[09:22:20] <m_gol> these are current stats btw http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html
[09:22:36] <m_gol> 5.6% of the total Android market share at this point
[09:22:42] <markelog> so 6%
[09:22:47] <timmywil> hopefully that will drop
[09:22:48] <markelog> all 2.
[09:23:05] <markelog> but that is all android browsers
[09:23:08] <markelog> not all mobile
[09:23:10] <m_gol> yes
[09:23:12] <markelog> or not all browsers
[09:23:21] <markelog> so percentage is not that high
[09:23:37] <timmywil> true, maybe it's low enough in terms of overall market share?
[09:23:38] <markelog> i would even try to assume that a lot is falling in that env
[09:23:54] <markelog> timmywil: now, that is subjective, some could say yes
[09:23:59] <markelog> some could say no
[09:24:05] <timmywil> perhaps we could make it compat-only
[09:24:43] <m_gol> we could make it compat-only but IMO only if we decide that when we drop IE8 we also drop Android 2.3
[09:24:45] <markelog> since compat differs from master only with support of ie8
[09:24:54] <m_gol> I wouldn't want to maintain the compat branch just for Android 2.3
[09:24:59] <markelog> it might be a thing to consider
[09:25:12] <markelog> m_gol:well, that's not gonna happen
[09:25:24] <markelog> surely ie8 will die after android 2.x
[09:25:35] <m_gol> I know arschmitz wanted Android 2.3 support on master
[09:25:35] <timmywil> At what point is the percentage low enough to drop a browser? 2%?
[09:25:47] <markelog> i would say 3%
[09:25:56] <m_gol> but it's really an ES3 browser as we see, we were assuming master is ES5
[09:25:59] <timmywil> right, best to defer to arschmitz on whether to support it
[09:26:07] <markelog> that is what some companies doing on browser support
[09:26:26] <timmywil> does defineProperty work on 2.3?
[09:26:28] <m_gol> Android 2.3 has never been green for us btw
[09:26:39] <m_gol> timmywil: I don't think so
[09:26:41] <markelog> we can maintain parital support of 2.3
[09:26:58] <markelog> like if no one, except for us, notice the bug
[09:27:00] <markelog> we don't fix it
[09:27:08] <m_gol> the thing is, we kind of already half-support Android 2.3
[09:27:08] <markelog> that is what i mean by "partial"
[09:27:11] <timmywil> ok, sounds like it needs more investigation. If we've never actually supported it, maybe we should just drop it.
[09:27:18] <m_gol> lots of tests have an `if (android23)` guard
[09:27:28] <m_gol> and there are these AJAX weirdnesses now
[09:27:34] <m_gol> and manipulation failures for checked radios
[09:27:35] <markelog> m_gol: i know you added them though )
[09:27:41] <m_gol> yes :P
[09:27:44] <m_gol> that was some time ago
[09:27:49] <m_gol> when I was an optimist
[09:27:57] <m_gol> and I believed I can win with this terrible browser
[09:28:09] <m_gol> but it's been fighting hard
[09:28:17] <markelog> war is not yet lost!
[09:28:31] <markelog> i think arschmitz would be in favour of leaving it in
[09:28:37] <m_gol> does history know about cases of burnout caused by Android 2.3 debugging? :P
[09:28:43] <m_gol> yeah, I think so
[09:28:45] <m_gol> unfortunately
[09:28:58] <timmywil> if we've never had full support, I wonder how much jQuery mobile covers for our deficiencies
[09:29:03] <markelog> there was some guys that went crazy with old IE
[09:29:12] <markelog> :-)
[09:29:15] <m_gol> :)
[09:29:31] <m_gol> we could test that it doesn't crash
[09:29:40] <markelog> mobile could apply their workarounds in their code
[09:29:46] <m_gol> and more or less returns what expected in various modules
[09:29:50] <m_gol> like, a few tests per module
[09:30:00] <markelog> smoke tests you mean
[09:30:08] <m_gol> yes
[09:30:08] <m_gol> but that will still mean our code needs to be parseable in this browser ;)
[09:30:25] <timmywil> "Support for Android 2.3 dropped to keep m_gol out of psychiatric institution"
[09:30:31] <m_gol> :)
[09:30:39] <m_gol> Zepto supports Android 2.3
[09:30:43] <m_gol> or so they say on their page
[09:31:13] <markelog> well, velocity it can be used as drop in
[09:31:16] <markelog> for animate
[09:31:24] <timmywil> btw, if we turn on es3: true, will the use of defineProperty throw an error?
[09:31:25] <m_gol> timmywil: I doubt jQuery Mobile tests if the right margin is reliably returned in Android 2.3
[09:31:27] <markelog> *velocity says
[09:31:39] <m_gol> timmywil: it doesn't, JSHint passes on my PR :)
[09:31:40] <markelog> timmywil: shouldn't
[09:31:41] <m_gol> Travis checks it
[09:31:52] <timmywil> ok
[09:31:52] <m_gol> I only had to add a JSON global
[09:31:56] <markelog> that is host property not a syntax thing
[09:31:56] <m_gol> and check sth in 3 places
[09:32:04] <m_gol> yup
[09:32:19] <timmywil> alright, I need to run
[09:32:20] <m_gol> this particular PR is not a huge nuisanse, it's just all these bugs that happen all the time
[09:32:34] <markelog> timmywil: would like to land delete thing
[09:32:48] <markelog> how can we verify problem is still exist?
[09:32:58] <markelog> since jsperf is down and all
[09:33:08] <m_gol> benchmark.js exists
[09:33:16] <timmywil> I'm not sure, but I'd like to avoid it if at all possible
[09:33:20] <timmywil> hold off on landing
[09:33:23] <markelog> yeah, but someone else would need to duplicate it
[09:33:27] <timmywil> we have time
[09:33:38] <markelog> okay
[09:33:45] <timmywil> thanks everybody
[09:33:48] <markelog> see ya!
[09:33:51] <m_gol> I wanted to propose dropping iOS 6 & Safari 6... but that can wait until next meeting ;)
[09:34:04] <markelog> lets create an issue about that?
[09:34:06] <m_gol> k
[09:34:11] <markelog> cool
[09:34:12] <timmywil> yup, please add to agenda and it will get included for next week
[09:34:16] <m_gol> k
[09:34:20] <timmywil> thanks
