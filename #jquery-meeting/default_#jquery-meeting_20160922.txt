[12:00:20] <bethge> Hi
[12:00:22] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:16] <bethge> Sorry, been meaning to finish the PR to cut out touch_delay, will do this weekend.
[12:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[12:02:04] <afa> PEP PEP Hooray
[12:02:40] <bethge> Hi afa
[12:03:15] <afa> ahoy
[12:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> hey afa
[12:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> We have a PR to ensure pressure is 0 for `pointerup` events.
[12:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/313
[12:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> The related W3C discussion is here: https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/146
[12:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> The PR looks good to me.
[12:05:24] <appsforartists> I wasn't able to run tests on that PR because tests are broken.  Have been since July.
[12:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> Minus the author change, but we can just merge that one commit.
[12:06:02] <arschmitz> yea
[12:06:09] <appsforartists> Google's open source office requests that it be listed in any AUTHORS file, as it holds the copyright
[12:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> It wasn't listed when Google owned the project.
[12:07:12] <appsforartists> Was there an AUTHORS file when Google owned it?
[12:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:07:22] <appsforartists> strange
[12:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> And all of our meta changes were approved by Google prior to the transfer.
[12:08:15] <appsforartists> I only know what our open source office tells me.  This is the file they required us to include in a bunch of our repos:
[12:08:16] <appsforartists> https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-experiments-js/blob/develop/AUTHORS
[12:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/146/files
[12:10:20] <appsforartists> https://github.com/Polymer/polymer
[12:10:40] <appsforartists> :shrug:  I don't know if Polymer had an exception, or if they just made a mistake.  Their current repo doesn't even have an AUTHORS file
[12:10:45] <appsforartists> for some reason, those sent out-of-order
[12:11:20] <appsforartists> anyway, i don't wanna get blocked on that.  i'm just trying to do what our legal people tell me to do
[12:11:59] <appsforartists> but that can be a separate issue.  the more important point is that i can't get any w3c tests newer than July to run
[12:12:17] <appsforartists> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/314
[12:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> We have this problem every so often.
[12:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Where something changes upstream and we need to make modifications to how we pull the tests in.
[12:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> We'll get it fixed.
[12:14:05] <bethge> I just deleted my w3c folder and ran grunt test and it downloads and runs through smoothly
[12:14:16] <appsforartists> did you point it at a new commit?
[12:14:47] <bethge> ah ok, its only with a new hash?
[12:14:53] <appsforartists> newer than july
[12:15:07] <appsforartists> i think when @rbyers added html files to the resources folder
[12:15:13] <appsforartists> but manually adding those in doesn't fix it
[12:15:55] <appsforartists> it would be great if the testing infrastructure was documented, perhaps in contributing.md
[12:16:00] <appsforartists> it's not fun to reverse engineer
[12:16:19] <appsforartists> and i'm still not sure how to manually run the tests, e.g. in a browser without selenium
[12:17:13] <appsforartists> (i haven't tried running an http server in the w3c folder yet - just in web-platform-tests/pointerevents, which doesn't work)
[12:17:20] <appsforartists> and my work laptop is dead right now
[12:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have a system set up for manual testing.
[12:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> You'd have to edit the w3c test to load PEP.
[12:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> The wpt repo has instructions for running the tests.
[12:19:06] <bethge> i think you can just run an http server in w3c
[12:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> If you need any help with that, let me know.
[12:19:44] <appsforartists> thanks.  i will
[12:20:02] <bethge> the line with the script tag to load pep is inserted by the pretest
[12:22:49] <bethge> The version of Web platform tests in package.json should be this one: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/commit/c98d1ff0ea91ba1aa9a15e8ea2d70d8ede1fdc0e from December 2015
[12:23:09] <bethge> Ah wait, sorry you mean this july
[12:23:12] <bethge> nvm
[12:23:54] <appsforartists> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/315
[12:24:01] <appsforartists> issue to track test documentation
[12:24:23] <appsforartists> as for the test failures, this seems to be the problematic commit:
[12:24:24] <appsforartists> https://github.com/material-foundation/web-platform-tests/commit/c5d333c859075744b3828a2a29057ee456234cb2
[12:26:48] <arschmitz> that class touchActionNone might be the issue we use a touch-action attribute which is wired in somehow to the w3c tests but i dont remember how
[12:28:35] <bethge> Do we even add the touch-action attribute at all?
[12:29:16] <bethge> I vaguely remember that being one of the issues for adding testing for touch event input, but may be mistaken.
[12:31:02] <arschmitz> well no test would pass without it pep wont work with out it
[12:31:45] <arschmitz> another question though is testing now that chrome and ie both have native we can really only test in safari and FF
[12:32:25] <appsforartists> you have to manually enable pointerevents in chrome.  after they ship, IDK if you can disable them the same way
[12:32:43] <appsforartists> firefox and chrome are at the same place with pointerevents (both ship behind a flag)
[12:39:40] <bethge> Tbh, i don't think you need touch-action attribute for mouse events: http://jsbin.com/wojofixoki/1/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[12:41:42] <bethge> We should possibly change the wording in Getting Started, "By default, no pointer events are sent from an element ..."
[12:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I wonder if we should really be trying to sell pointer events in the readme.
[12:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> Or if we should just assume that anyone coming to PEP understands what Pointer Events are and that's why they're here.
[12:44:55] <arschmitz> i dont think a lot of devs fully understand them still
[12:45:09] <arschmitz> and may have got to us either through a recomendation or SO or similar
[12:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else for today?
[12:51:37] <appsforartists> Recap:
[12:51:54] <appsforartists> - https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/313 is approved
[12:52:25] <appsforartists> - https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/314 Tests are broken.  scott_gonzalez will look into a fix.
[12:52:42] <appsforartists> - https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/315 The testing process needs to be documented
[12:53:26] <appsforartists> - Discussed removing PointerEvents explanation from README, but decided to leave it in
[12:53:31] <appsforartists> Is that a fair assessment?
[12:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:53:44] <appsforartists> =)
[12:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.

[14:09:38] <arschmitz> which is good
[14:10:08] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: submitted a PR for updating for the new classes changes but i requested a small change
[14:12:45] <arschmitz> There was another performance issue about classes filed on UI but i cant reproduce so waiting for more info but seems like non issue so far
[14:13:11] <arschmitz> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15049
[14:16:52] <arschmitz> i didnt get much time this week for other stuff
[14:17:02] <arschmitz> apsdehal: you have a block assigned to your self
[14:17:11] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8519

[14:18:57] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[14:18:57] <apsdehal> I am going to take other two priority blockers too
[14:18:58] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: do you think you could try to find a minute to check that one out
[14:19:17] <arschmitz> apsdehal: which 2?
[14:19:27] <apsdehal> #8507 and #8506
[14:19:36] <apsdehal> If jasperdegroot is ok with that
