[09:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> Meeting time!
[09:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> We're still making progress on the API site.
[09:02:11] <jzaefferer> yay progress
[09:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> UI and Mobile are now using the same XSL.
[09:02:23] <jzaefferer> they are?
[09:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they're duplicates, but they're are no differences.
[09:02:37] <jzaefferer> still separate copies?
[09:02:39] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> there are
[09:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to add <signature> support.
[09:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> And get to the point where core and UI can use the same XSL.
[09:03:40] <jzaefferer> and then move it to grunt-jquery-content...
[09:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> At that point, we'll move the files to grunt-jquery-content.
[09:03:56] <jzaefferer> btw. ping kborchers gnarf rxaviers
[09:04:06] * rxaviers here
[09:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll also be working on widget factory docs.
[09:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> Hoping to get that done this week.
[09:04:49] <kborchers> here now, other meeting just ended
[09:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> But it requires a lot of the XSL changes.
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> So who knows how long that'll take.
[09:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery Color 2.0.0 was finally released!
[09:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yay gnarf
[09:05:36] <jzaefferer> yay color!
[09:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> So that's pulled into UI now, and the last open ticket that was being addressed in the color rewrite has been closed.
[09:06:21] <jzaefferer> two download builder PRs just landed from rxaviers, two more to go, then we'll have docs included and nice unit tests
[09:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:06:44] <rxaviers> :)
[09:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> I started working on jqueryui.com, adding the 1.9 upgrade guide.
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm currently working on generating a TOC from the markdown file.
[09:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's proving to be a bit painful.
[09:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> Another thing I'm trying to finish this week...
[09:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> Also working on the 1.8.23 release.
[09:07:52] <jzaefferer> yay Scott
[09:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> Which is actually almost done.
[09:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's already tagged and on the jQuery CDN :-)
[09:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> We simplified the licensing, along with core and Mobile.
[09:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> No more GPL :D
[09:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> ...and Color; made sure to drop GPL before the 2.0.0 release.
[09:09:22] <jzaefferer> yay MIT
[09:09:54] <scott_gonzalez> And finally, 1.8.0 is now in master and 1-8-stable.
[09:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> And we're running tests against 1.8.0 in TestSwarm.
[09:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/518
[09:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> And that's the whole agenda!
[09:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> lightning meeting :-P
[09:10:50] <kborchers> man do i love seeing all green test swarm screens :)
[09:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> I know. This makes me very happy: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui
[09:11:24] <kborchers> that is awesome!
[09:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else?
[09:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> If not, let's continue the party in -dev.
[09:12:46] * kborchers moves keg to -dev
