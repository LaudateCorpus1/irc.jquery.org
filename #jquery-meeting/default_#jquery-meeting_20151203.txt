[12:01:06] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:11] <bethge> hi
[12:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> We've re-enabled the functional tests for Travis.
[12:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> And arschmitz has a PR for launching ChromeDriver automatically when we run the tests.
[12:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/245
[12:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had a chance to review that yet since it just came in.
[12:04:37] <arschmitz> yeah its just adding a grunt task
[12:04:40] <arschmitz> nothing special
[12:05:37] <arschmitz> interesting so grunt test does not run jshint
[12:05:41] <arschmitz> but grunt ci does
[12:05:58] <arschmitz> seems like test should be running jshint / jscs
[12:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> Correct. grunt test just runs tests.
[12:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> The default task runs linters and tests.
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> `npm test` should run `grunt` though, not `grunt test`. That's something we should change.
[12:07:50] <arschmitz> why wouldnt you want to build and lint before running tests?
[12:08:03] <arschmitz> if your making change you need to do that for the changes to reflect anyway
[12:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> We do build before running tests.
[12:08:32] <arschmitz> sorry ok so why wouldnt you want to lint
[12:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, `npm test` wouldn't run the actual tests if it just ran `grunt` though.
[12:09:01] <arschmitz> it takes almost no time and is going to fail on ci anyway
[12:09:09] <arschmitz> nope
[12:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why it's done this way.
[12:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> We can add linting to the test task.
[12:10:36] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[12:10:59] <arschmitz> its pretty common to also use it as a fail fast for tests that take a while like the functional ones
[12:11:38] <arschmitz> anyway ill do a pr for that
[12:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer has a PR to polyfill offsetX and offsetY.
[12:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/233
[12:12:24] <arschmitz> i saw it but have not really had a chance to look at it yet
[12:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> I believe this is no longer a WIP.
[12:12:38] <jzaefferer> Still doesn't have tests
[12:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to get a browser vendor to verify the implementation is correct.
[12:13:02] <jzaefferer> That would be nice, too
[12:13:39] <arschmitz> need to bug jrossi
[12:13:43] <arschmitz> and or rick
[12:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I just pinged both of them, plus Matt and jdalton.
[12:15:08] <arschmitz> lol so our lodash version is depracted and throwing warns on npm install
[12:15:23] <arschmitz> thought that was funny with everything jdalton did lately :-)
[12:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:17:39] <bethge> Is there anything I can do on https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/195 ?
[12:18:11] <bethge> Always appreciate feedback (here to learn ;) )
[12:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess I should review that, huh?
[12:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> That completely fell off my radar when we were dealing with the W3C test.
[12:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'll put that on my list.
[12:19:34] <bethge> Well, if it wouldn't bother you :) I believe we should also update the commit-id of the w3c suite we are pulling
[12:20:10] <bethge> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/blob/master/package.json#L39
[12:20:29] <bethge> I can add that to the PR.
[12:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good
[12:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else?
[12:20:54] <arschmitz> should be simple as long as nothing breaks after its good lol
[12:21:42] <arschmitz> i dont have anything else
[12:22:01] <bethge> yup, that was all from me
[12:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, thanks everyone.
[14:00:50] <arschmitz> agcolom: cgack: gabrielschulhof: sfrisk: jasperdegroot: apsdehal1: Meeing time
[14:00:54] <sfrisk> allo
[14:01:07] <jasperdegroot> hola
[14:01:09] <cgack> howdy all!
[14:02:06] <agcolom> hello :-)
[14:02:49] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[14:03:09] <arschmitz> I finished reviewthing the selectmenu PR from gabrielschulhof but looks like he is not here
[14:03:44] <arschmitz> cgack: any progress on tables?
[14:04:05] <agcolom> btw, meeting notes: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=1708695740&vpid=A1
[14:05:18] <cgack> arschmitz: not really, work got busy after the last meeting, then the holiday. hoping to make some progress this week
[14:05:42] <arschmitz> cgack: ok sounds good
[14:05:55] <cgack> probably will end up just taking the existing table and adding classes option if the cherry-pick keeps being troublesome
[14:06:28] <arschmitz> @jasperdegroot iv restarted your pr a couple times but its getting errors
[14:06:51] <jasperdegroot> yeah I saw that too
[14:07:01] <jasperdegroot> but don't really understand what is causing it
[14:07:11] <arschmitz> im seeing same ones on 1.5-dev actually they are in table
[14:07:21] <arschmitz> its timeing out ill look at that
[14:07:32] <jasperdegroot> ok
[14:07:35] <jasperdegroot> will do a rebase once it's fixed on 1.5-dev
[14:07:52] <jasperdegroot> I continued to work on fixing demos locally
[14:07:56] <jasperdegroot> the PR isn't holding me up
[14:08:05] <arschmitz> @jasperdegroot the demo tests are failing on your pr too though
[14:08:10] <arschmitz> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/92033191
[14:08:32] <arschmitz> and those are passing on 1.5-dev
[14:09:24] <jasperdegroot> ok I'll take another look
[14:09:35] <arschmitz> looks like some bad refrences
[14:09:50] <arschmitz> to files
[14:10:12] <jasperdegroot> yeah, those I didn't understand because I didn't move anything
[14:10:27] <jasperdegroot> but will try to figure out why the tests fail
[14:10:44] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: in theory you should just be able to go to the same page in your browser and should get same error
[14:11:22] <jasperdegroot> maybe it has to do with how the test is set up?
[14:11:27] <jasperdegroot> something hard coded in there?
[14:11:30] <jasperdegroot> don't know
[14:11:33] <jasperdegroot> will look first :)
[14:11:46] <arschmitz> the test just points the spider at a url
[14:12:41] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: this looks wrong http://localhost:8303/listview-nested-lists/demos/_assets/css/jqm-demos.css
[14:12:53] <jasperdegroot> I see in the test report that ...
[14:12:59] <jasperdegroot> was about to say the same :)
[14:13:00] <jasperdegroot> swipe-list/demos/_assets/css/jqm-demos.css
[14:13:15] <arschmitz> and http://localhost:8303/listview-autodividers-selector/external/jquery/jquery.js
[14:13:23] <jasperdegroot> but if you go to that page the CSS is loaded
[14:13:55] <jasperdegroot> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-demos-issues/demos/swipe-list/
[14:14:25] <jasperdegroot> so that's the part I don't understand
[14:14:39] <arschmitz> hmm
[14:14:57] <arschmitz> oh i see the issue
[14:15:21] <arschmitz> using relative urls
[14:15:40] <arschmitz> and they are failing when its missing the branch folder name it seems
[14:16:04] <jasperdegroot> aha
[14:16:26] <arschmitz> but i dont think you changed that
[14:16:28] <arschmitz> ...
[14:16:51] <jasperdegroot> yeah, I didn't
[14:17:02] <jasperdegroot> did we change something in the test?
[14:17:06] <arschmitz> no
[14:17:13] <arschmitz> and ts passing on 1.5-dev
[14:17:41] <jasperdegroot> weird
[14:17:47] <jasperdegroot> ok let me think of what it can be
[14:17:54] <jasperdegroot> can continue with the meeting in the mean time
[14:17:57] <arschmitz> yeah ill look too
[14:18:07] <arschmitz> ok so for other work going on
[14:18:16] <arschmitz> jQuery UI is getting really really close to beta
[14:19:12] <arschmitz> apsdehal1: i think just has 1 test to fix for the bootstrap
[14:19:14] <arschmitz> for tests
[14:19:18] <arschmitz> which is really exciting
[14:19:44] <arschmitz> last thing i have is help wanted issues
[14:20:09] <arschmitz> if everyone can take a few minutes and try to tag some help wanted issues esipically some easy ones i think that would be great
[14:20:28] <arschmitz> a lot of people looking right now because of 24 PR's
[14:22:06] <arschmitz> does anyone else have anything
[14:22:07] <arschmitz> ?
[14:22:23] <cgack> help wanted should be.. something someone can handle in a short period of time?
[14:22:49] <agcolom> just that I think we can get rid of https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/221  from the notes as an issue?
[14:23:22] <arschmitz> @agcolom yes
[14:23:32] <arschmitz> cgack: yeah
[14:24:09] <cgack> arschmitz: great. I'll try take a look and tag what I can
[14:24:21] <jasperdegroot> I will do the same
[14:24:27] <arschmitz> awesome thank you
[14:24:36] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: you might have a lot of good demo ones
[14:24:44] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I do see some issues in the demos test with selectors
[14:24:51] <arschmitz> agcolom: api would be good too if you know of some easy ones
[14:25:12] <agcolom> sure
[14:25:13] <jasperdegroot> yeah, maybe I should break https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8245 up in smaller issues
[14:25:42] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: issues in selectors? im not sure we are talking about same tests
[14:26:03] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/build/tasks/options/spider.js
[14:26:04] <jasperdegroot> tests/casperjs/demos.test.js
[14:27:20] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i dont think we run those any more
[14:27:39] <jasperdegroot> grrr sorry I was on master
[14:29:37] <arschmitz> maybe something in here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/demos/_assets/js/jqm-demos.js
[14:31:18] <jasperdegroot> I did make changes in there
[14:31:27] <jasperdegroot> not sure how that affects the spider
[14:31:41] <arschmitz> well there is url re-writing in there
[14:31:52] <arschmitz> so if you broke something by accidnet based on relative paths
[14:31:54] <jasperdegroot> the one for the homepage?
[14:32:19] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/demos/_assets/js/jqm-demos.js#L7
[14:33:04] <arschmitz> a few things below that do to not sure its related just something to check
[14:33:36] <jasperdegroot> here are the changes in jqm-demos.js: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8332/files#diff-510eea303cf6718a212dc1de97d60ee5R48
[14:33:59] <jasperdegroot> anyways, let's move this to -dev
[14:34:57] <arschmitz> yeah anyway
[14:35:03] <arschmitz> does any one have anything else?
[14:35:14] <sfrisk> nope
[14:35:23] <cgack> I'm good
[14:35:23] <arschmitz> ok thank you everyone
[14:35:39] <jasperdegroot> later all
