[09:00:20] <arschmitz> hi
[09:00:21] <rxaviers> hey
[09:00:23] <fnagel> hey
[09:00:25] <kborchers> howdy
[09:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> So, let's start with the big news.
[09:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> AMD landed in master.
[09:01:36] <paul_irish> \o/
[09:01:40] <rxaviers> :)
[09:01:58] <tj_vantoll> :)
[09:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to update our tests to load files through AMD to ensure test coverage.
[09:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> I assume rxaviers will just continue from the work he already did in the PR.
[09:03:27] <rxaviers> correct. Do we want AMD tests on 1.11?
[09:03:37] <rxaviers> for*
[09:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:03:45] <rxaviers> ok
[09:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing else to discuss about AMD right now, correct?
[09:04:57] <rxaviers> nothing else occurs me
[09:05:01] <tj_vantoll> I started work on a tutorial on it for the learn site.
[09:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> Great. We should publish that at the same time as 1.11.
[09:06:11] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, it'd be a good thing to link to from the release blog post / upgrade guide. I'll have it ready in time.
[09:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz is working on checkboxradio.
[09:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> Anything to discuss regarding that right now?
[09:07:21] <arschmitz> nothing to discuss its back to where it was with before and after
[09:07:30] <arschmitz> im fixing some things people had noticed with that
[09:07:46] <arschmitz> then ill do a
[09:07:51] <arschmitz> PR with the new branch
[09:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> Great. Hopefully we can get a good review/discussion session in San Diego.
[09:08:55] <arschmitz> yeah that would be awesome
[09:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers has been working on the date module for Globalize.
[09:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/202#issuecomment-33504187 explains the current plan for dealing with timezones.
[09:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> That's everything on the agenda. Is there anything else that someone would like to discuss?
[09:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to discuss http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9775
[09:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that we should have any of this built into datepicker.
[09:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have a good feel for how often weekend markings are actually used?
[09:15:36] <tj_vantoll> You can easily add the behavior this user is looking for with an extension point in the rewrite: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/datepicker/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js#L433
[09:15:56] <tj_vantoll> I think their request is reasonable, but an edge case.
[09:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> Should we close as "plugin" and explain how it will be handled in the rewrite?
[09:17:47] <rxaviers> does datepicker mark end of weekend now? It seems so, right? Using ui-datepicker-week-end class?
[09:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[09:18:07] <tj_vantoll> I'm torn. It looks bad if we close it as "plugin"â€¦ when you can't actually build a plugin currently.
[09:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> So just leave it open until the rewrite lands?
[09:18:33] <rxaviers> Do you want to remove it from datepicker, and make this as a plugable feature?
[09:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:19:05] <tj_vantoll> So remove all weekend handling altogether in the rewrite?
[09:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> Is the rewrite doing anything for weekends right now?
[09:19:34] <tj_vantoll> nope
[09:19:36] <rxaviers> ok, got it.. I thought we were talking about making pluggable the code to make weekend dynamic.
[09:21:14] <rxaviers> But, I vote to not make this an option. But, part of the localization using globalize.
[09:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't seen many datepickers where there's actually different styling or anything for weekends.
[09:21:28] <rxaviers> vote for*
[09:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like usairways.com styles them.
[09:21:49] <tj_vantoll> I've used beforeShowDay: $.datepicker.noWeekends for a scheduling use case before.
[09:22:30] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: me too
[09:22:41] <tj_vantoll> I say we add the current class names using the current implementation.
[09:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, that seems easy to implement though.
[09:22:49] <tj_vantoll> But we make it extensible.
[09:23:06] <tj_vantoll> So this guy with his edge case can do what he needs to do.
[09:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> If we're going to add them, we need to do it right.
[09:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> Adding the classes is different than disabling the dates though.
[09:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> This ticket is about adding the classes.
[09:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically the concern is about adding classes to the headings.
[09:24:43] <tj_vantoll> The datepicker currently uses the firstDay option to drive the ui-datepicker-week-end class name exclusively.
[09:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> If we're going to keep the classes, it should be based on CLDR.
[09:25:22] <tj_vantoll> And we have that information, correct rxaviers?
[09:25:28] <rxaviers> correct
[09:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> It basically comes down to how popular we think it will be.
[09:26:54] <tj_vantoll> Is there an API in Globalize currently to access this information?
[09:27:10] <tj_vantoll> From the widget's perspective this should be simple.
[09:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, http://www.flyfrontier.com/ has a script error for their datepicker.
[09:27:47] <tj_vantoll> If ( Globalize.isThisDayAWeekendDayInThisCultureOrWhatever) {
[09:27:48] <tj_vantoll>     addClass( "ui-datepicker-week-end" );
[09:27:48] <tj_vantoll> }
[09:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm checking all of the major airlines right now.
[09:28:24] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, cldr.js has an API to access any CLDR info.  Globalize exposes the cldr.js instance, so we can access any info using Globalize. If this it too hacky, we can proxy it via some API on Globalize.
[09:29:02] <rxaviers> lol
[09:29:10] <tj_vantoll> ok
[09:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> I checked every airline on the first three pages of Google, plus kayak, hipmunk and AOL. Three sites styled the weekends.
[09:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> So that's about 10%.
[09:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's probably high enough to include, since it wouldn't be an option, it'd just be built-in and smart enough to use the locale data.
[09:33:43] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I say we accept the ticket and document this on the Wiki.
[09:34:38] <arschmitz> +1
[09:34:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:34:50] <rxaviers> probably a good option would be a boolean whether or not to highlight weekends
[09:35:12] <rxaviers> letting localization handle the details
[09:35:13] <tj_vantoll> With the class names that's trivial to add on your own.
[09:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9775#comment:6
[09:36:36] <tj_vantoll> Looks good.
[09:36:39] <rxaviers> +1
[09:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, see everyone back in -dev.
[09:38:54] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
