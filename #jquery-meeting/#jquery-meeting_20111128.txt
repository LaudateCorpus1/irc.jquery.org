[08:53:44] <DaveMethvin> .
[08:53:53] <addyosmani> ..
[08:55:42] <DaveMethvin> oh, addyosmani, always trying to one-up me :D
[08:55:56] <addyosmani> Someone has to keep you on your toes DaveMethvin :D
[09:00:46] <DaveMethvin> hope everyone had a great thanksgiving
[09:01:09] <rwaldron> coming in here just after chatting in -dev always reminds me of this...
[09:01:10] <rwaldron> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7IcDtaK0adU/S6-Q1DIapSI/AAAAAAAAA_Y/Qus2vP9n_mg/s320/lockers_you+can't+do+that+on+television.jpg
[09:01:15] <rwaldron> "Heyyyy Dave"
[09:01:19] <addyosmani> hah!
[09:01:22] <rwaldron> "Yessss, Rick??"
[09:01:36] * rwaldron gets green slimed for no reason
[09:02:01] <addyosmani> I would watch and or DVR said show.
[09:02:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah and why do they always screw up the good cable networks?
[09:02:09] <DaveMethvin> i remember when mtv played music
[09:02:41] <rwaldron> So... that WEBKIT_ONLY stuff... that's just browser sniffing in sheeps clothing
[09:03:21] <DaveMethvin> let's come back to that in -dev later rwaldron, i think there are cases where it could be useful
[09:03:25] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh94FG5Q_j8
[09:03:27] <DaveMethvin> sooo...
[09:03:36] <DaveMethvin> the agenda!
[09:03:49] <addyosmani> The argument that a) other plugins or b) third-party scripts on the page may assume a 'complete' version of jQuery is available makes me want to push towards closure.
[09:03:55] <addyosmani> despite being a modular/AMD fan.
[09:03:57] <DaveMethvin> i've seen a few bugs come through, most were not newly introduced just newly found
[09:03:58] <addyosmani> agenda!
[09:04:04] <rwaldron> I added something
[09:04:07] <rwaldron> :O
[09:04:23] <DaveMethvin> what's a twitter dev request?
[09:04:28] <rwaldron> Yes
[09:04:33] <rwaldron> Allow me to explain
[09:04:34] <addyosmani> a dev request from someone at twitter?
[09:04:53] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron wouldn't be that obvious addyosmani :D
[09:04:56] <rwaldron> I received an email from Angus Croll (twitter dev), asking for a trivial favor
[09:04:57] <addyosmani> :P
[09:05:04] <rwaldron> but it deserves explanation
[09:05:25] <rwaldron> Apparently they have some sort of "sanity tests" that they use for their builds
[09:05:33] <rwaldron> and jQuery gets run through this wringer
[09:06:17] <rwaldron> well, they're trying to upgrade from 1.5.x to 1.7.1 and apparently there is a comma at the end of comment line that is causing their sanity tests to barf
[09:06:33] <DaveMethvin> they use the uncompressed version?
[09:06:41] <rwaldron> probably not
[09:06:45] <rwaldron> they probably build
[09:07:04] <rwaldron> and serve their own compressed version
[09:07:22] <rwaldron> I did offer that they could "donate" these tests to jQuery and we'd add them to our tests, but no word on that
[09:07:31] <rwaldron> anyway, the line in question was indicated to be
[09:07:34] <rwaldron> me*
[09:07:39] <gnarf> but the comma at the end of the line in a comment is causing a problem
[09:07:49] <rwaldron> i have a branch that removes a few end-of-comment-line commas
[09:07:55] <rwaldron> it's weird, yes... i know
[09:07:59] <DaveMethvin> which one was it?
[09:08:07] <rwaldron> I'm not sure why any test would care
[09:08:33] <rworth> maybe it's checking for end of line commas ala IE
[09:08:34] <DaveMethvin> it seems strange to say "some comment in the uncompressed code with a trailing comma is causing our tests to fail" so we take them all out
[09:08:53] <DaveMethvin> i thinik we would want to know more
[09:09:08] <DaveMethvin> maybe their sanity test isn't sane? :)
[09:09:21] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin it was one of these: https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery/commit/e7e89cc913f93ced9e5c7c2be95d2893dd726910
[09:09:22] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by rwldrn (3d, 17h ago): Remove comma at end of comment line causing issues with certain build systems
[09:09:33] <rwaldron> i changed em all... not that it should matter
[09:09:39] <rwaldron> anyway, like I said, trivial
[09:09:51] <DaveMethvin> but there isn't a valid reason to do it
[09:09:57] <rwaldron> rworth possibly
[09:10:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yeah
[09:10:06] <rwaldron> agreed
[09:10:14] <DaveMethvin> and we'll break this again without a build script to ensure it doesn't happen again
[09:10:24] <rwaldron> but there is no side effect, so i dont see a reason not to
[09:10:30] <DaveMethvin> breaking a multi-line comment on a comma seems like a good idea
[09:10:46] <rwaldron> hey dude, i agree
[09:10:52] <DaveMethvin> ok then let's get some more info
[09:11:01] <rwaldron> like...?
[09:11:01] <rworth> there is no side effect other than comments are written in english to be read by humans
[09:11:01] <DaveMethvin> it really sounds like their sanity test isn't right
[09:11:19] <rworth> and the proposed fix is to apease a computer that's barfing on something it can safely ignore
[09:11:20] <DaveMethvin> the info i would like is, what does their sanity test look for
[09:11:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it's an insanity test
[09:11:34] <miketaylr> trade the commit for some super short twitter names
[09:11:40] <rworth> haha
[09:11:41] <miketaylr> @r
[09:11:41] <rwaldron> ok, guys... FWIW i totally agree with everything your saying
[09:11:49] <DaveMethvin> ok then ask him for some more info
[09:11:50] <rwaldron> please, dont shoot the messanger
[09:12:00] <rwaldron> messenger*
[09:12:04] <gnarf> we can do this if they can destroy @gnarf and let me take it over
[09:12:06] <DaveMethvin> massager
[09:12:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin what do we want to know?
[09:12:13] <miketaylr> are those the only 3 comments affected?
[09:12:18] <rwaldron> miketaylr not even
[09:12:27] <rwaldron> i just fixed all of them in core.js
[09:12:36] <rwaldron> not "fixed" but you know what i mean
[09:12:36] <DaveMethvin> why is their sanity test breaking on comments?  why are they sanity checking against the uncompressed file?
[09:12:42] <miketaylr> ya
[09:12:44] <DaveMethvin> those are two i can think of right now
[09:13:28] <rwaldron> ok, Im going to loop jquery-bugs into it, ok?
[09:13:40] <miketaylr> will that make it public?
[09:13:47] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:13:51] <DaveMethvin> which is fine with me
[09:13:55] <miketaylr> oh i guess these logs are public :P
[09:13:58] <miketaylr> dunno if twitter wants that
[09:14:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah maybe this is proprietary trailing-comma detection code
[09:14:21] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:14:27] <gnarf> heh
[09:14:35] <gnarf> like the tweet @rwaldron?
[09:14:35] <miketaylr> you've said too much DaveMethvin
[09:14:36] <gnarf> :)
[09:14:43] <DaveMethvin> comma comma comma chamelion
[09:14:52] <DaveMethvin> alright next up
[09:14:52] <gnarf> you come and go
[09:14:56] <gnarf> you come and gooooooo
[09:15:10] <gnarf> lovin would be easy if my commas were like the wind
[09:15:17] <DaveMethvin> you're good
[09:15:31] <DaveMethvin> for the 1.8 stuff, most of the suggestions are pretty expected
[09:15:36] <DaveMethvin> "put in mobile events"
[09:15:38] <DaveMethvin> and the like
[09:15:47] <DaveMethvin> we can go through it next week when it closes
[09:16:15] <DaveMethvin> we are starting to accumulate more prs
[09:16:40] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: Do you thing the discussions regarding sizing will spill over into -meeting at some point or are those best left explored via the list/group at the moment?
[09:16:41] <DaveMethvin> if possible we should land a bunch soon so we can have them well tested for 1.7.2
[09:17:15] <DaveMethvin> addyosmani: i have a feeling those will be long so i hope we can boil them down before a meeting here
[09:17:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin given what miketaylr just mentioned, I've only included you on the email
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> dunno if that will work
[09:17:27] <addyosmani> sounds reasonable DaveMethvin
[09:17:47] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov suggested the jshint switch, he's got a pull rq for it
[09:18:07] <DaveMethvin> the good is that it does find undeclared vars, the bad is that it goes all gestapo on order of declarations
[09:18:11] <rwaldron> Hopefully those haven't bit-rotted
[09:18:17] <DaveMethvin> given the pro, i'm willing to live with the cons
[09:18:20] <rwaldron> me too
[09:18:35] <DaveMethvin> any other thoughts? i know jaubourg wasn't thrilled with it
[09:18:51] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin Orkel fixed that 10006 shenanigans
[09:19:01] <rwaldron> jaubourg hates change
[09:19:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw
[09:19:24] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg and I need to sit down and figure out where to put the special events docs
[09:19:33] <DaveMethvin> they are pretty much done tho
[09:19:51] <DaveMethvin> and rworth is just waiting to talk about github, right??
[09:19:56] <rworth> :)
[09:20:12] <DaveMethvin> which also involves kswedberg
[09:20:27] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, rworth: sorry I've been AWOL lately. on vacation the past week. trying to get caught up today
[09:20:33] <DaveMethvin> np
[09:20:37] <rworth> kswedberg: np
[09:20:45] <rworth> it was a long holiday weekend after all
[09:20:51] <DaveMethvin> i like the idea of moving docs to github as  you've set it up rworth
[09:20:59] <DaveMethvin> it should be pretty simple
[09:21:09] <DaveMethvin> i just need to fork your repo and play with it
[09:21:12] <rwaldron> Yeah, +1 to docs on github
[09:21:38] <DaveMethvin> that would also mean we could use github's monitoring for changes i guess
[09:21:40] <kswedberg> rworth:  yeah, me too. just need to test things out, play around wth it a bit
[09:22:02] <rworth> ok, well feel free to take the week and provide feedback
[09:22:16] <rworth> let's discuss next week whether jquery repo or jquery-docs repo
[09:22:20] <rworth> that's it for me
[09:22:24] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[09:22:55] <DaveMethvin> does anyone have thoughts on how we might work on 1.8? should we continue to do a one-at-a-time?
[09:23:00] <gnarf> jquery-docs repo could include mobile and ui as well
[09:23:04] <DaveMethvin> or should we move to 1.7.2 and 1.8 in parallel
[09:23:28] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: parallel if we have 1.8 features piling up already
[09:23:55] <DaveMethvin> we just need to figure out what 1.8 features are :D
[09:24:07] <gnarf> a 1.8 branch - or a 1.7-stable branch would be useful if we wanted to start working 1.8 - i think we could side-by-side it
[09:24:20] <gnarf> also i can easily get jenkins/testswarm monitoring both branches
[09:24:25] <gnarf> so testing wont be a huge deal
[09:24:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I think we should wait on planning 1.8 until we have an idea about what the work load will look like
[09:24:42] <gnarf> i can agree with that too
[09:24:50] <gnarf> its kinda moot to talk about until we have pulls for 1.8
[09:24:54] <gnarf> or time to work on it
[09:24:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i think we are blocked waiting for more info on closure
[09:25:14] <DaveMethvin> they need to make changes before we can use it
[09:25:22] <rwaldron> Also, Kyle Simpson tweeted some comments when we released 1.7 that the releases might be coming too quickly
[09:25:26] <DaveMethvin> but as far as the reducing dependencies we coudl start that sooner
[09:25:35] <DaveMethvin> i agree that we don't need to move too quickly
[09:25:41] <rwaldron> he wasn't trolling, so it felt valid to listen to what he had to say
[09:25:42] <DaveMethvin> a lot of ppl are on 1.4.x still
[09:25:59] <DaveMethvin> which means they are on old ajax, old attributes, old event, etc
[09:26:03] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:26:15] <rwaldron> Honestly, I see no rush to 1.8
[09:26:25] <DaveMethvin> but as part of 1.8 planing i think we should look to what 1.9 and 2.0 will do
[09:26:29] <rwaldron> there are really great features in 1.7
[09:26:41] <rwaldron> that most of the world arent even using yet
[09:26:48] <DaveMethvin> this might be a good time to follow what ui did as far as deprecating things and making 2.0 a lot cleaner/smaller
[09:27:01] <rwaldron> it would be nice to let those features permeate
[09:27:23] <gnarf> i wouldn't mind having time to really dig into the effects rewrite instead of feeling rushed too
[09:27:34] <gnarf> reminds me, i need to put that up for 1.8
[09:27:39] <rwaldron> totally
[09:28:00] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then, i guess we are done?
[09:28:20] <DaveMethvin> last one to -dev is a rotten egg!
[09:28:41] <rwaldron> Rob Larsen posted a lazyweb tweet last night asking about realworld examples of promis.resolveWith() and this morning tweeted that he had zero responses
[09:28:45] <rwaldron> that doesnt really mean anything
[09:29:13] <rwaldron> but maybe it does?
[09:29:15] <rwaldron> i dunno
[09:29:28] * rwaldron headcold talk
[09:29:31] <gnarf> rwaldron: other than ajax?
[09:29:40] <addyosmani> rwaldron: I've seen people do the same with $.Callbacks, though .resolveWith() does have more real world uses.
[09:29:57] <rwaldron> let's move to dev
