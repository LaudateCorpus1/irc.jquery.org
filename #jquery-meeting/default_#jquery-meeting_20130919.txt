[11:02:26] * _|Nix|_ waves enthusiastically
[11:02:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz gseguin|away agcolom RWhitbeck toddmparker
[11:02:44] <uGoMobi> hey all
[11:02:47] <arschmitz> here
[11:02:52] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:04:02] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BweVshL8qcno4jE0WVJGFiIU641CsuigFFhJbpYAw5I/edit?usp=sharing
[11:04:54] <uGoMobi> just the 3 of us?
[11:05:02] <arschmitz> looks like it
[11:05:25] <_|Nix|_> Let's make a lot of noise so it sounds like there's more of us!
[11:05:37] <RWhitbeck> Hi
[11:05:42] <_|Nix|_> See?
[11:05:43] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:05:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ and toddmparker were the only ones that weren't in Austin
[11:05:58] <uGoMobi> so let's start with a quick update
[11:06:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz and agcolom did a talk there and they were awesome!
[11:06:52] <agcolom> Hi, sorry just got back home :-)
[11:06:59] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[11:06:59] <arschmitz> woo up to 5
[11:07:29] <uGoMobi> about the UI/Mobile meeting
[11:08:08] <uGoMobi> we discussed that after the "merge" it will still be two projects with their own repos
[11:08:18] <uGoMobi> or at least two products
[11:08:46] <uGoMobi> but we want to have one download builder
[11:08:51] <_|Nix|_> That's cool!
[11:09:17] <_|Nix|_> I vote we build it on top of grunt from the repo.
[11:09:18] <uGoMobi> and, as you already knew, all widgets should work in both UI and Mobile
[11:09:49] <uGoMobi> then theming...
[11:10:02] <uGoMobi> we met with Kristofer from Adobe / Topcoat
[11:10:16] <uGoMobi> see Topcoat.io
[11:10:29] <gseguin> here now
[11:10:37] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[11:10:46] <gseguin> hiya, sorry for being late
[11:11:11] <RWhitbeck> no excuse :P
[11:11:12] <uGoMobi> we want to collaborate with Topcoat
[11:11:30] <uGoMobi> and they with us :)
[11:11:42] <gseguin> about topcoat they have their channel on freenode now: #topcoat
[11:11:56] <gseguin> we might want to lurk in there
[11:12:06] <uGoMobi> yesterday arschmitz and I talked with Dave and Scott during Dev leads meeting
[11:12:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: thanks, I will join that channel
[11:12:41] <uGoMobi> and we are thinking about making the CSS framework a project on its own
[11:12:56] <uGoMobi> it should work with both UI and Mobile but also standalone
[11:13:44] <uGoMobi> Topcoat has same goals as we do and is very enthusiastic about collaborating so that looks really good
[11:13:58] <uGoMobi> I will meet with Kristofer again next week here in Amsterdam
[11:14:09] <RWhitbeck> Will there be a "download" builder for css.  That could make the file size really big unless we offer a way to choose.
[11:15:34] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: the current download builder also takes care of css files
[11:16:07] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: I think we will keep the possibility to just build the CSS for the widgets you use
[11:16:15] <uGoMobi> like we have now
[11:16:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I would love to have the --modules option also build only the css needed.
[11:16:48] <uGoMobi> would be even better if you could build one CSS file with custom theme and structure CSS only for the widgets you use
[11:17:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does it in which order you include CSS files?
[11:17:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, structure files.
[11:17:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It shouldn't rigth?
[11:18:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: currently same order as the JS files
[11:18:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'd love to take a look at how to do the CSS via requirejs then ...
[11:19:19] <uGoMobi> anyway, I just wanted to give a heads up about what we talked about last week
[11:19:47] <uGoMobi> this is more long term stuff, so how the download builder and theme roller should work is something to look into later
[11:20:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom and RWhitbeck worked on the new web site last Thursday
[11:20:45] <uGoMobi> what's the status of that?
[11:20:52] <RWhitbeck> I think I am more concerned with complexity that we are creating with "merging" projects which seems to "separate" them.
[11:21:39] <gseguin> The problem with CSS is that there are no standard way (AFAIK) of associating CSS to JS modules
[11:21:48] <RWhitbeck> I haven't had a chance to work much on it since I left Austin but plan on working alot more this weekend on jquerymobile.com.
[11:21:52] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: it might be a bit complex to build or change the download but for end users it is less complex
[11:22:12] <agcolom> I haven't had a chance to work on that either
[11:22:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I was hoping that requirejs would have a hook where I can parse the file just before it adds it to jquery.mobile.js ...
[11:22:19] <RWhitbeck> I'd like to make a list of priority and add those to github issues to track what's left to do so we know when we are ready to launch.
[11:22:20] <gseguin> our homegrown thing is not solid enough as you can't load a module via requirejs and have the css inserted
[11:22:34] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: sounds like a good plan
[11:22:36] <gseguin> yeah, me too
[11:23:03] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: let's see what is needed to make it good enough to switch
[11:23:13] <RWhitbeck> I'll be working on that more this weekend.
[11:23:31] <uGoMobi> great
[11:23:59] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:24:12] <uGoMobi> 1.4 beta release
[11:24:36] <uGoMobi> any open issues that keeps us from releasing?
[11:25:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : what do you think?
[11:25:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: worst i know about is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6347
[11:25:59] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6347 by doomsy (1mon 4d ago): Scrolling vertically on panel fails after first scroll on ios device (1.4.0a2)
[11:26:13] <arschmitz> which im working on
[11:26:24] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:26:26] <arschmitz> that ones is annoying!!
[11:26:35] <arschmitz> but that does not need to hold back beta
[11:26:52] <_|Nix|_> Exactly ... I was just gonna say ...
[11:27:07] <uGoMobi> yeah, we can still fix bugs after beta 1
[11:27:08] <_|Nix|_> I think we should roll beta ASAP ...
[11:27:12] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[11:27:50] <uGoMobi> I have to make sure this one is resolved https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6348
[11:27:50] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6348 by uGoMobi (1mon 3d ago): Theme inheritance during transition
[11:28:17] <uGoMobi> because that might require changes that you shouldn't do after beta
[11:28:41] <uGoMobi> and I will check default value for panel theme option
[11:28:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[11:29:00] <uGoMobi> then I suggest we release Monday morning
[11:29:15] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[11:29:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin ^^ ok with you?
[11:29:30] <gseguin> Monday works for me
[11:29:47] <uGoMobi> I have to update the build script for demos before I can merge demos-update branch
[11:29:53] <uGoMobi> otherwise I break the build
[11:30:14] <uGoMobi> I think it's just a matter of changing folder names
[11:30:20] <gseguin> I still can't figure out why effing Travis is barfing on the no-prefix branch
[11:30:35] <uGoMobi> yeah, bummer
[11:30:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah thats weird
[11:30:53] <uGoMobi> gseguin: shall we wait with it until after the 1.4 final release?
[11:30:58] <gseguin> I would have loved to see that change in 1.4 (not that it matters to the user)
[11:31:04] <uGoMobi> so you have time to look into it
[11:31:17] <gseguin> it really doesn't matter that much for the end user
[11:31:27] <uGoMobi> yeah me too, but not sure if we should do it after beta
[11:31:43] <gseguin> fine with me
[11:33:01] <uGoMobi> for the API docs we need to create api.jquerymobile.com/1.4/
[11:33:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: is that something you can do?
[11:33:25] <agcolom> I can speak with scott_gonzalez and see how we do that
[11:33:36] <uGoMobi> that would be great
[11:33:42] <agcolom> sure, no problem
[11:34:18] <agcolom> so we want to release that monday also, right? (what sort of time?)
[11:35:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: morning for gseguin means afternoon for us
[11:35:19] <agcolom> ok, that works
[11:35:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's not big problem if it's online bit later
[11:36:06] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[11:36:06] <agcolom> right, yes, that might be better for me
[11:36:29] <uGoMobi> so we are going to deprecate buttonMarkup and style options
[11:36:36] <uGoMobi> in 1.4
[11:36:46] <agcolom> so evening for me because I'll be at work... all depends how long it takes. Might be quick, in which case it should be ok
[11:37:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that's fine
[11:37:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: let me know if I can help with anything
[11:37:27] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6451
[11:37:33] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6451 by gabrielschulhof (1w 3d ago): Deprecate buttonMarkup
[11:37:54] <uGoMobi> I change that milestone to 1.4
[11:38:16] <uGoMobi> is there a ticket for removing it? with milestone 1.6?
[11:38:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^^
[11:38:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No.
[11:38:37] <agcolom> so we need to mention that buttonMarkup is deprecated in the 1.4 branch
[11:38:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Only for deprecating it.
[11:38:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[11:38:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I can add that.
[11:38:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thanks!
[11:39:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[11:39:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so we're officially deprecating buttonMarkup. That means API docs, code, and 1.4-changelog
[11:39:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[11:39:28] <uGoMobi> unless you object
[11:39:30] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:39:35] <_|Nix|_> Hell, no!
[11:39:39] <_|Nix|_> Good riddance!
[11:39:49] <uGoMobi> I wanted to do it together with removing style options from widgets
[11:39:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz made this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZGlikXfhIEz9GUDJ1TLNHUVHaV-TlFC4zk_YgL3dUo/edit
[11:40:42] <uGoMobi> we can deprecate those options because they all work by adding a class
[11:40:54] <uGoMobi> in some cases option wrapperClasses
[11:41:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you mean slider and rangeslider are deprecated?
[11:41:27] <arschmitz> yes
[11:41:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: new or refactored slider in 1.5
[11:42:01] <arschmitz> even if we dont replace for several versions we should do it now so people know its on its way out
[11:42:03] <_|Nix|_> That's fine, but that doesn't make it deprecated. The new slider will have the same API, just a different implementation - no?
[11:42:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no it will be a whole new widget
[11:42:27] <arschmitz> which we will share with ui
[11:42:49] <arschmitz> so the new one will be a collaboration to meat both projects needs
[11:43:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hold on. Just because it's re-written doesn't mean it won't work the same way. You'll still be doing .slider() and autoinit, and stuff.
[11:43:19] <arschmitz> right
[11:43:26] <arschmitz> but the api will likely be different
[11:43:34] <arschmitz> as far as methods and options
[11:43:39] <arschmitz> and events
[11:43:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aha, OK.
[11:44:11] <arschmitz> right now ours and ui's are very different
[11:44:19] <arschmitz> so it will likely be somewhere in between
[11:44:34] <uGoMobi> how many sliders did you test arschmitz ? ;-)
[11:44:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so I guess the new and the old are sufficiently different to not just deprecate individual options/event/etc.
[11:45:02] <arschmitz> in portland we tests all sorts plus we did general concept testing
[11:45:25] <uGoMobi> I think it's good to have our hands free and deprecate the slider widget as it is
[11:45:27] <arschmitz> originally we had decided to go with the one i wrote for filament as a basis
[11:45:55] <arschmitz> but after talking with scott_gonzalez about it there some major things to change there too
[11:46:15] <arschmitz> so its exact form is still very much up in the air
[11:47:01] <uGoMobi> right
[11:47:19] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss re: 1.4 beta release?
[11:47:54] <uGoMobi> PR's
[11:48:10] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6436
[11:48:10] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #6436 by gabrielschulhof (2w 1d ago): Textinput autogrow transition
[11:48:22] <arschmitz> thats good to go right _|Nix|_?
[11:48:40] <uGoMobi> I think so too
[11:49:02] <agcolom> I have a few things I need to ask but that can be done in dev
[11:49:26] <agcolom> otherwise can do it here quickly, I don't mind
[11:49:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sure, shoot
[11:49:36] <agcolom> 2 are quick
[11:49:43] <agcolom> ok. here:
[11:50:08] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/144#issuecomment-24702057
[11:50:09] <b-ot> agcolom: Issue #144 by gabrielschulhof (1mon 2d ago): Some iframes have two scrollbars on FF
[11:50:20] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Are you still seeing this issue?
[11:50:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Lemme check ...
[11:50:52] <agcolom> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/145
[11:50:52] <b-ot> agcolom: Issue #145 by uGoMobi (2w 6d ago): Data- attribute reference: data-collapse-cue-text and data-expand-cue-text missing
[11:51:11] <agcolom> are these from 1.3.2? or from 1.4?
[11:51:22] <agcolom> I just wanted to check before adding this
[11:51:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: 1.3
[11:51:34] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, I will add those then
[11:51:42] <uGoMobi> great, thanks
[11:51:54] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep, still seeing it.
[11:52:08] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: which page?
[11:52:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: checkboxradio
[11:52:28] <agcolom> with FF or Chrome?
[11:52:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: FF.
[11:52:34] <agcolom> are you on a Mac
[11:52:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Chrome too.
[11:52:58] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No. Linux.
[11:53:04] <agcolom> Ah!
[11:53:14] <agcolom> I'm not seeing this on the Mac
[11:53:29] <agcolom> Could someone else test also? http://api.jquerymobile.com/checkboxradio/
[11:53:34] <uGoMobi> I can test it on both Linux and Mac later
[11:53:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No.
[11:53:41] <uGoMobi> I will
[11:53:42] <_|Nix|_> Not api.jquerymobile.com
[11:53:48] <agcolom> oh
[11:53:58] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: which one?
[11:53:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It's only on the local build, because I changed all the examples to use 1.4.0-alpha.2
[11:54:01] <uGoMobi> it's in the 1-4 branch?
[11:54:07] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[11:54:08] <_|Nix|_> 1-4
[11:54:10] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:54:11] <agcolom> oh, I see, sorry!
[11:54:21] <uGoMobi> let's take this to -dev
[11:54:21] <agcolom> How do I see the 1.4 branch?
[11:54:27] <agcolom> sure
[11:54:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You have to build locally.
[11:54:37] <agcolom> I have I think
[11:54:59] <agcolom> but then I'm nore sure... maybe in -dev?
[11:55:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, let's do it in -dev.
[11:55:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is the autogrow PR good to go?
[11:55:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[11:55:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should be.
[11:55:40] <uGoMobi> ok, let's rebase -i it onto master then :)
[11:55:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But I wouldn't mind arschmitz's eyes on it one last time before it goes in.
[11:55:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure ill look again
[11:56:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just a quick look-see to make sure I'm not doing something insanely wrong.
[11:56:33] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6445
[11:56:34] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #6445 by hyunsook (1w 6d ago): Reducing $.extend function calls to improve performance.
[11:56:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I looked into that quite deeply, and I don't think it improves performance much.
[11:57:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh i meant to reply to that last night
[11:57:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also we cant do it
[11:57:33] <_|Nix|_> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au8wFOs7WWDUdGZOc3pnZTQyTDBBU3U0ZXpiU1liUkE#gid=0
[11:57:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why not?
[11:57:52] * _|Nix|_ is just curious
[11:58:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its not just about performance extend does checks and it also leads to very poor code quality
[11:58:20] <arschmitz> that pr also modifys ui-core
[11:58:45] <_|Nix|_> Those results are based on http://web-ui-fw.github.io/extend-vs-assign/instructions.html
[11:59:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. I wasn't thinking of applying it as-is, but the fact that the performance improvement is, like, non-existent puts the kibosh on it, I think.
[11:59:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in general assignment is always going to be slightly faster
[11:59:50] <arschmitz> there is no function call overhead
[12:00:27] <arschmitz> and asignment is fine if its just a single item and nothing crazy
[12:00:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, apparently a lot faster: http://jsperf.com/extend-vs-direct-setting/2
[12:00:59] <arschmitz> but when doing multiple items like we generally are extend should be used
[12:01:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But I guess it's very little in the overall picture, so even a lot faster doesn't mean much.
[12:02:41] <uGoMobi> ok so we are not going to make this change
[12:02:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I doubt it.
[12:02:55] <uGoMobi> can you guys comment on the PR and close it?
[12:03:08] <arschmitz> yup
[12:03:08] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:03:13] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:03:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: firefox issues
[12:03:56] <arschmitz> ok i had a call with Dave and mike taylor from mozilla yesterday
[12:04:21] <arschmitz> they are interested in trying to fix all firefox related issues / bugs we currently have
[12:04:37] <arschmitz> and staying up to date on new ones we find so they can fix them
[12:05:02] <arschmitz> so there are a few things we can do here
[12:05:11] <arschmitz> first add a label to the issue tracker
[12:05:18] <arschmitz> for firefox related items
[12:05:29] <arschmitz> this includes firefox os and firefox for android
[12:05:53] <arschmitz> next we should try to find all firefox related issues and workarounds we know about and i will email them to him
[12:05:56] <uGoMobi> I just added Firefox label to issue tracker
[12:06:07] <arschmitz> or collest in google doc
[12:06:10] <arschmitz> collect
[12:06:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know one: You need to turn off pushState inside FF-based iframes.
[12:06:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i found that one doing a code search already :)
[12:06:35] <arschmitz> but yes perfect example
[12:07:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we had an issue on api.jquerymobile.com about that.
[12:07:28] <arschmitz> also he said we can feel free to lean on him for any "mozilla" related things we have and he will do what he can to help and bug the right people for us
[12:07:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: During 1.3.x we actually had an ugly script to turn off pushState in all the examples, and a comment that that script was unnecessary :/
[12:07:41] <uGoMobi> coo
[12:07:44] <uGoMobi> cool*
[12:08:10] <arschmitz> he is doing the same with core
[12:08:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tell him to implement WeakMap - pronto!
[12:08:38] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:08:53] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually quite serious ... we need that!
