[12:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> `uiteam
[12:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> b-ot: You're killing me
[12:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jzaefferer fnagel
[12:00:52] <fnagel> hey
[12:01:02] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Button!
[12:02:03] <arschmitz> landed YAY!
[12:02:17] <arschmitz> oh yeah i suck though i didnt close the tickets
[12:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh?
[12:02:24] <arschmitz> all button tickets are fixed
[12:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> Or the PR...
[12:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see the CSS ticket I mentioned this morning?
[12:02:44] <arschmitz> yes
[12:02:57] <arschmitz> its fixed
[12:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yay
[12:03:19] <arschmitz> i can double check but i went through all open button tickets a couple months ago andconfirmed all were fixed
[12:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, can you go through and close all the tickets?
[12:03:31] <arschmitz> so unless something regressed durring reviews all are fixed
[12:03:34] <arschmitz> yup
[12:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll close the PR now.
[12:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> Let's double check just to be sure.
[12:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> We should also check if we need any tests based on the tickets.
[12:04:10] <arschmitz> yeah but in theory out button checkbox button set issue count should now be zero
[12:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't get the squashes in, huh? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/eae5671dc551d09d03c0076f67680d4ada015bfc
[12:04:35] <arschmitz> doh no i just missed that one
[12:04:47] <arschmitz> all the fixup ones should be gone
[12:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> If you want, we can just make this part of the work for the dev summit :-)
[12:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> Button: review all open tickets
[12:08:04] <arschmitz> sure
[12:08:12] <arschmitz> i doubt ill get to it before then
[12:08:27] <arschmitz> and its a good contributor task
[12:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> Can you just check the CSS one since it's filed as a CSS issue and will probably get overlooked?
[12:09:07] <arschmitz> yup
[12:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've added that to the dev summit work list.
[12:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to datepicker.
[12:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1590 was merged into the datepicker branch.
[12:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> So we can work on fixing the focus handling now.
[12:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> Has that been started, fnagel?
[12:10:54] <fnagel> No, not yet
[12:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> We have the CLDR discussion scheduled for this Friday at 11:00a ET.
[12:11:45] <arschmitz> do we know for sure that works with whatever is planned for us?
[12:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, we don't know anything for sure. We don't really have a schedule.
[12:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> But because of that, we'll make it work.
[12:12:13] <arschmitz> that was kinda my point
[12:12:51] <fnagel> Is rafael with you guys?
[12:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> All I know is we're meeting form 9:00a - 6:00p and Firefox discussion is at 1:00p.
[12:13:11] <arschmitz> i dont even know anything about firefox discussion
[12:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Yeah, Rafael will be at the summit.
[12:14:56] <fnagel> Ok, so if it does NOT work there is a chance to make it happen that weekend anyway
[12:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but I don't see any reason it won't work out.
[12:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> So that brings us to the upgrade guide that jzaefferer has been working on.
[12:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably get some people to work on that during the summit as well.
[12:18:22] <arschmitz> yeah it needs button docs
[12:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what the mix of people will be like.
[12:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> But hopefully we'll get some people interested in docs.
[12:18:49] <fnagel> jzaefferer: Did you check my additions on the summit doc? Helpful?
[12:18:56] <arschmitz> which are also needed for Mobile so maybe we can get them to multi task that it will be mostly duplicate content execpt for a few backcompat differences
[12:20:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we can definitely have people working on multiple projects.
[12:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> There's so much overlap.
[12:20:18] <arschmitz> yup
[12:20:30] <arschmitz> because half the changes to UI now effect mobile
[12:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:21:00] <arschmitz> we also need to talk again about how to effectivly document these widgets
[12:21:06] <arschmitz> we had kinda punted last time
[12:21:30] <arschmitz> because the docs for mobile need to be everything on ui but with some additions
[12:22:56] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we'll get someone that actually knows XSL...
[12:23:06] <arschmitz> that would be awesome lol
[12:24:45] <arschmitz> we need to be able to "extend" the ui one almost lol not sure if thats even vaguely possible though lol
[12:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> Might need to make api.jqueryui.com a dependency of api.jquerymobile.com so we can create documents that build on the other documents.
[12:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not sure if you can do that at the XML level.
[12:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> That might have to happen at the XSL level.
[12:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> And that might get tricky to maintain.
[12:26:55] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can put the meta data in the XML and have the XSL read it and act on it.
[12:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see...
[12:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted to talk about a very old ticket.
[12:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6642#comment:17
[12:32:30] <scott_gonzalez> Let me know what you think.
[12:34:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i tend to agree
[12:35:16] <arschmitz> in mobile we listen for outside events and close popup type things in response to keep things sane
[12:36:35] <fnagel> "any widget that has a contextual open state should listen for actions outside of the widget and revert back to the closed state." +1
[12:37:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we're all in favor of closing this ticket and dealing with the interaction in the individual widgets.
[12:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss today?
[12:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today. Thanks everyone. See you back in -dev (and most of you in NYC soon).
