[08:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no, we're botless.

[09:01:01] <fnagel> hey
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: The last comment on the button PR is from jzaefferer, saying "Let me know when I should do another review."
[09:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> So am I correct in assuming I should be waiting right now?
[09:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll come back to that.
[09:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Are you waiting on more feedback for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1590?
[09:05:32] <fnagel> yes
[09:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll go through that.
[09:06:04] <fnagel> thanks!
[09:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Rafael introduced me to Juho to discuss webpack (re: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14375)
[09:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> I gave Juho some info about the request and asked for feedback.
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't get to that until this morning, so I haven't heard back yet.
[09:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> I was looking through some datepicker tickets today and boy are there a lot that will be closed as soon as we merge datepicker into master :-)
[09:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure the JSCS updates (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1589) are ready to be merged as well.
[09:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> There was just a small change to that arschmitz was going to make to the Grunt task.
[09:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have anything else to discuss?
[09:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> And I think by "anyone else" I mean fnagel, as everyone else seems to not be here :-P
[09:11:17] <fnagel> hehe
[09:11:22] <fnagel> no, nothing else
[09:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Alright. That might give me enough time to get through your PR before the dev leads meeting :-)
[09:11:49] <fnagel> :-D
[09:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks "everyone." See you back in -dev.
