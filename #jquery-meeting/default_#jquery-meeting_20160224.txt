[12:01:17] <arschmitz> hi
[12:02:31] <jzaefferer> hello
[12:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> I tried two different ways to get Travis to use a newer version of Java so we could upgrade grunt-html.
[12:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> I tried setting the JDK: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1674
[12:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> I tried using the trusty build: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1679
[12:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> Neither worked.
[12:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm inclined to just stay on an old version until Travis upgrades.
[12:03:35] <arschmitz> yeah no real harm
[12:03:49] <jzaefferer> Using trusty seems to have worked for other projects, not sure why it didn't work here.
[12:04:07] <jzaefferer> As long as we're not running into warnings or errors that never validator versions fix, it shouldn't matter
[12:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> That brings us to selectmenu's icon position.
[12:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> Alex landed the PR to move it back where it belongs.
[12:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1671
[12:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> Still waiting on docs update.
[12:05:49] <arschmitz> no jzaefferer already reviewed docs update
[12:06:07] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/297#issuecomment-188354084
[12:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you sure do like waiting for the last minute before the meetings for your PRs :-P
[12:06:46] <arschmitz> lol i do most of my work for ui and mobile on wed and thursday
[12:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's all the updates I had for this week.
[12:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> We still have the menu style regression to fix: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14919
[12:08:53] <arschmitz> i closed a 1.12 blocker this morning that had been left open for some reason
[12:09:11] <arschmitz> was a button one i had commented was fixed
[12:09:14] <arschmitz> but never closed
[12:09:54] <jzaefferer> Is that menu issue the only blocker for 1.12?
[12:10:31] <arschmitz> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/16?V=1.12.0
[12:10:43] <arschmitz> look like a sortable one too
[12:11:01] <jzaefferer> meh
[12:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> Note that the sortable one was set as a blocker by the reporter.
[12:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> It has not been triaged.
[12:11:20] <arschmitz> oh ok i issed that
[12:11:51] <jzaefferer> its been over a year since I wrote that menu patch
[12:12:06] <jzaefferer> will take some time to understand what's going on there
[12:13:08] <jzaefferer> I can try to fix that tomorrow morning
[12:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> great
[12:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> The resizable grid regression regressed in 1.11, so I'm not as concerned about it. https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14916
[12:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> Should we aim for beta 2 next week?
[12:17:40] <arschmitz> +1
[12:18:09] <jzaefferer> was there enough to justify enough beta instead of going to rc1?
[12:18:23] <jzaefferer> also re travis and grunt-html, I noticed something: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1679/files#r53972512
[12:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> I think we could go to an RC
[12:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll try again with trusty.
[12:19:32] <jzaefferer> When it fails, can you keep the PR open anyway? Or link to the failed build? Once you close it, the link is gone
[12:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[12:22:41] <jzaefferer> nope
[12:22:46] <arschmitz> im good
[12:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> Alright, thanks everyone.
[13:04:29] <agcolom> kswedberg: zz_AurelioDeRosa arthur Content meeting time
[13:04:56] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[13:05:59] <kswedberg> so sorry. in a mtg at work. I have one ear to the irc though. :)
[13:06:49] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone. Sorry, I'm a bit late
[13:06:52] <agcolom> hey Karl :-)
[13:07:00] <agcolom> Hi Aurelio, no worries :-)
[13:08:00] <agcolom> Just 2 points from the last meeting... iframe sizes were all checked and Scott updated the api docs for the next release
[13:08:28] <agcolom> and we've sent the proposal for the interactive tutorials for the learning center as part of GSOC 16
[13:08:46] <agcolom> Aurelio and I will co-mentor if the project is approved
[13:09:30] <AurelioDeRosa> Fingers crossed. Let's see how many spots we'll obtain
[13:09:31] <agcolom> regarding https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/884  and https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/885
[13:09:45] <agcolom> indeed! let's hope we get more than 3 :-)
[13:09:52] <agcolom> regarding https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/884  and https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/885
[13:10:27] <agcolom> jQuery 3.0 will no longer lowercase attributes so that should no longer break camel cased SVG attributes
[13:10:51] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes, I've read the message by Micha≈Ç.
[13:11:00] <agcolom> however, the official line is still that jQuery doen't support SVG (some things will work)
[13:11:08] <AurelioDeRosa> Today or tomorrow I'll submit a PR for that issue. The other one has been addressed and closed.
[13:11:18] <agcolom> fantastic! Thank you!
[13:11:56] <AurelioDeRosa> I'll also take care of https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/894
[13:12:06] <agcolom> I only just noticed!!
[13:12:09] <AurelioDeRosa> That has been created a few hours ago.
[13:12:10] <agcolom> sorry about that!
[13:12:25] <agcolom> ha, must have been while I was away from the computer!
[13:12:57] <agcolom> kswedberg: could you please take a look and check it's all ok?
[13:13:21] <kswedberg> let me know if there is anything will look
[13:13:44] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/698
[13:14:23] <agcolom> do we need to specify package.json and *.yml should be set to two spaces though.
[13:15:36] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: I've just realised once a pull request is sent, any updates don't trigger notifications
[13:15:45] <agcolom> so we've all missed it :-)
[13:16:16] <AurelioDeRosa> Next time I'll ping you with a message then
[13:17:25] <AurelioDeRosa> I have a couple of questions.
[13:17:28] <agcolom> sure
[13:17:43] <kswedberg> sorry. that made no sense.
[13:17:54] <AurelioDeRosa> 1. How do we deal in future with issues like https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/121
[13:18:25] <AurelioDeRosa> Is there an official way of dealing with these type of attacks we want to adopt?
[13:21:00] <agcolom> The way we try to deal with this is to keep calm and polite.
[13:22:11] <agcolom> And explain things as clearly as we can.
[13:22:50] <AurelioDeRosa> Cool. Is it fine to close any issue straight away if it's like the 2-3 opened from the same person?
[13:23:03] <agcolom> People sometimes get frustrated and decide to express their frustration via issues.
[13:23:42] <agcolom> yes, you can also add a note to say please do not open mutiple issues for the same problem, or This was already discussed at....
[13:23:49] <agcolom> and add the link, and close.
[13:24:06] <gnarf> AurelioDeRosa: I would prefer not "close with no response"
[13:24:17] <gnarf> which is why i added my reasoning to the ticket
[13:24:31] <agcolom> yes, I would recommend that alsp
[13:24:33] <agcolom> also
[13:24:58] <agcolom> except if it pure spam (i.e. not jQuery related)
[13:25:17] <gnarf> however, if you're too perturbed to not sound annoyed in your responses, it might help to wait that out or ask someone else for a "positive" reply
[13:25:45] <AurelioDeRosa> To be honest, that's why I saw the issue and then didn't replied.
[13:25:55] <AurelioDeRosa> That's why I'm asking this question now.
[13:25:56] <gnarf> i was a bit too perturbed to even reply probably
[13:26:11] <agcolom> yes, never reply in haste
[13:26:26] <gnarf> AurelioDeRosa: i'd be happy to take any "please help me not explode on this person" pings you want to send my way... might not be around to help, but happy to try
[13:26:42] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you @gnarf!
[13:26:48] <AurelioDeRosa> I'll keep that in mnd
[13:27:03] <gnarf> I'm <usually> pretty good about not getting angry -- but that one went over the top
[13:27:34] <gnarf> it spilled over into https://github.com/OpenUserJs/OpenUserJS.org/issues/904 also
[13:29:29] <AurelioDeRosa> Wow, I'm going to have a good read at that.
[13:30:13] <agcolom> yes, that's how explaining things clearly and politely really helps
[13:30:28] <agcolom> and calms things down.
[13:31:09] <AurelioDeRosa> Great.
[13:31:35] <AurelioDeRosa> So, I think we can move to my second question then. It is about the GSOC and our jQuery content project. @agcolom when do we want to have a chat with the guy I mentioned to you?
[13:32:14] <agcolom> Should we wait until we know whether we're approved?
[13:32:56] <agcolom> (approved as an Organisation)?
[13:33:12] <AurelioDeRosa> @gnarf thank you for your feedback about my question
[13:33:59] <AurelioDeRosa> It makes sense. Should we discuss this in next meeting? I remember that the notifications will happen soon
[13:34:56] <agcolom> cool! Where are you based again for work?
[13:35:48] <AurelioDeRosa> Brixton but I live in Holloway. So we can either meet a South London or North London
[13:36:44] <agcolom> Ok, I live in SE london and work in Central London, so I'm easy also..
[13:37:29] <AurelioDeRosa> If that's fine to you, we can meet in Central London. I think there are nicer places to grab a coffee (or anything else) and have a chat about the project.
[13:37:30] <agcolom> Victoria Line is direct from Brixton to my work :-)
[13:37:38] <AurelioDeRosa> Excellent!
[13:37:42] <agcolom> perfect!
[13:38:11] <agcolom> Yes we could either meet at the university (I have a nice office :-) ) or grab coffee somewhere...
[13:38:23] <agcolom> sounds perfect!
[13:38:33] <AurelioDeRosa> OK. Do you have time next week?
[13:38:39] <agcolom> Let's chat as soon as we know.
[13:39:15] <AurelioDeRosa> week = meeting (sorry)
[13:39:21] <agcolom> Anything else to discuss?
[13:39:44] <AurelioDeRosa> Not from me. Unless you have something else issues related.
[13:39:56] <AurelioDeRosa> On a side note, is the count increasing or decreasing?
[13:41:21] <agcolom> I think that's it... Thanks everyone :-)
[13:41:43] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you. Bye.
[13:42:48] <agcolom> I'll close the channel. see you in -content
[13:44:31] <agcolom> sure, next week can work... I'll check dates...
[13:44:48] <agcolom> Tuesday AM?
[13:44:55] <agcolom> or friday AM?
[13:45:29] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: wow I got all the messages at once ;-)
[13:45:39] <agcolom> -6 in the last 2 weeks :-)
[13:45:54] <AurelioDeRosa> No worries. Let's chat in private for the details.
