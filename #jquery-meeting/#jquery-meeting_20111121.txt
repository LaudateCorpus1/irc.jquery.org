[09:02:11] <timmywil> good?
[09:02:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:02:54] <DaveMethvin> well who's here today?
[09:03:08] <JohnResig> I'm here!
[09:03:12] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:03:20] <DaveMethvin> you me and timmy perhaps
[09:03:23] <timmywil> woo!
[09:03:27] <DaveMethvin> must be thanksgiving week
[09:03:38] <mikesherov> I'm here
[09:03:54] <timmywil>  /kick
[09:04:34] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[09:05:44] <DaveMethvin> ok first thing, where did we leave the crown? i wanted to welcome mikesherov to the team
[09:05:53] <JohnResig> oh nice
[09:05:58] <JohnResig> congrats mike!
[09:06:09] <mikesherov> O.o
[09:06:12] <mikesherov> Thanks!
[09:06:22] <DaveMethvin> you deserve it, thanks for all your help lately
[09:06:40] <mikesherov> No problem, my pleasure.
[09:06:47] <DaveMethvin> for your first initiation you can rewrite Sizzle
[09:06:48] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:07:03] <mikesherov> With or Without non qSa :-P ?
[09:07:11] <DaveMethvin> no, you have to build up to that kind of torture, even timmywil can barely take that
[09:07:28] <DaveMethvin> one step above waterboarding
[09:07:54] <DaveMethvin> so 1.7.1
[09:07:57] <timmywil> there's a misconception there, since you brought it up.  we need nonQSA even in QSA browsers.
[09:08:27] <timmywil> though not things like the nodeHook, etc.
[09:09:02] <timmywil> 1.7.1, yes
[09:09:06] <DaveMethvin> i think we have 1.7.1 ready for release?
[09:09:43] <DaveMethvin> just two bugs open that are tagged for 1.7.1 and neither seem critical, i think we got that coment didn't we?
[09:10:03] <mikesherov> So, what's the protocol here? Can I suggest "just one more thing" for 1.7.1?
[09:10:12] <timmywil> oh i can close that low priority one
[09:10:17] <DaveMethvin> as long as it isn't the sizzle rewrite :P
[09:10:21] <timmywil> suggest away
[09:10:22] <DaveMethvin> what is it?
[09:10:32] <mikesherov> I would argue that the drag/drop hooks are critical for 1.7.1
[09:10:53] <DaveMethvin> i checked with scott on them, ui doesn't use em
[09:10:56] <DaveMethvin> but others may
[09:11:17] <mikesherov> and I think we already identified a good fix
[09:11:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think so but i didn't know how vital they were
[09:11:40] <mikesherov> however, testing the functionality isn't really unit-testable
[09:11:51] <DaveMethvin> that's always a bit scary
[09:12:11] <mikesherov> so, I think it's critical to get the fix in, but the unit testing doesn't really make good sense
[09:12:13] <timmywil> oh, i missed that.  congrats mikesherov
[09:12:17] <DaveMethvin> we prolly should have a .fix() unit test that calls it directly just to do some sanity checks
[09:12:22] <mikesherov> sure
[09:12:35] <mikesherov> thanks @timmywil
[09:12:58] <mikesherov> that's all I got for 1.7.1 that I think is missing
[09:13:10] <DaveMethvin> do we know of code that's using the drag/drop events? i guess this was one report
[09:13:23] <mikesherov> it's been reported a few times since 1.7
[09:13:26] <mikesherov> let me find it
[09:13:29] <DaveMethvin> oh i just saw that one
[09:13:39] <DaveMethvin> but if it's pretty common then yeah we should put it in
[09:13:54] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10816
[09:14:01] <rwaldron> whoops
[09:14:04] <rwaldron> sorry i'm late
[09:14:31] <DaveMethvin> np rwaldron
[09:14:37] <DaveMethvin> just check the notes
[09:14:57] <timmywil> just fyi, our only open ticket http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10006
[09:15:14] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: 10816 was the issue with ui copying over event props itself, i worked that out with scott this morning
[09:15:20] <DaveMethvin> i think
[09:15:38] <mikesherov> yeah, I talked to him before you did, I assume that happened after my train ride
[09:15:41] <DaveMethvin> we can double check after the meeting tho
[09:15:45] <mikesherov> k
[09:15:46] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:15:59] <timmywil> rwaldron's pull https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/581/files
[09:15:59] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (2w, 1d ago): Updates original patch by Orkel. Fixes #10006
[09:16:27] <DaveMethvin> so shoudl that one go in timmywil rwaldron
[09:16:36] <timmywil> looks right to me
[09:16:59] <timmywil> +1 rwaldron ?
[09:16:59] <DaveMethvin> kk
[09:17:02] <rwaldron> it's tested a bunch
[09:17:12] <rwaldron> on all supported browsers
[09:17:20] <rwaldron> not using stupid portable IEs
[09:17:23] <rwaldron> >;(
[09:17:30] <rwaldron> - the wink
[09:17:38] <timmywil> ok, i can land that and we'll do a jenkins after the meeting
[09:17:44] <DaveMethvin> thanks timmywil
[09:17:55] <rwaldron> How do you feel about landing the non-code PR
[09:17:58] <rwaldron> about contribution
[09:18:02] <rwaldron> so we can wrap that up
[09:18:06] <timmywil> oh ya
[09:18:08] <DaveMethvin> haven't looked at it yet
[09:18:10] <mikesherov> and get me to shut up about it ;-)
[09:18:19] <rwaldron> mikesherov i didnt say that
[09:18:25] <mikesherov> I did
[09:18:31] <DaveMethvin> but he was *thnking* it
[09:18:33] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:18:38] <rwaldron> for some reason I had always thought that stuff was ALREADY in the readme
[09:18:38] <mikesherov> lol
[09:18:44] <rwaldron> i'm glad you pointed out that it wasnt
[09:18:49] <mikesherov> np
[09:19:01] <timmywil> do we still not have a note about the local server running php
[09:19:09] <DaveMethvin> i put together a draft of the followup to the first blog post, the link is in the agenda and the bugs team has r/w access
[09:19:21] <rwaldron> timmywil that's in the bug fix guide
[09:19:27] <timmywil> ok cool
[09:19:30] <rwaldron> :)
[09:19:32] <mikesherov> @timmywil, regarding that, I think we should change the tests to note that
[09:19:49] <timmywil> mikesherov: the tests?
[09:19:50] <DaveMethvin> definitely want input, i tried to include some vague references to our epic 100-post thread on -bugs-team
[09:19:55] <mikesherov> meaning, when you open the test suite, and it detects !isLocal, it should display a message on the test page
[09:20:03] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig if you have a chance take a look
[09:20:16] <mikesherov> I didn't know about it until like 5 weeks or so into fixing bugs
[09:20:25] <timmywil> mikesherov: a bunch of ajax tests will fail, seems like a good sign
[09:20:31] <mikesherov> no, they don't
[09:20:32] <rwaldron> mikesherov how were you testing
[09:20:36] <mikesherov> they just don't run!
[09:20:48] <rwaldron> um.
[09:20:52] <mikesherov> they are all wrapped in !isLocal
[09:20:52] <rwaldron> that's dumb
[09:20:55] <timmywil> it's not a matter of local unless you're trying to run from file://
[09:21:01] <rwaldron> yeah, they are...
[09:21:01] <mikesherov> I was
[09:21:05] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: which issue is this? the isLocal?
[09:21:09] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DunC559UmGvOh_eTTrgyoLwNRZmjBr9ossPvIwqM83s/edit?hl=en_US
[09:21:10] <mikesherov> yes
[09:21:16] <rwaldron> i guess I never knew what happened when the tests were run like that
[09:21:22] <DaveMethvin> the draft blog post JohnResig
[09:21:22] <rwaldron> because i always use a server
[09:21:29] <rwaldron> because file:/// isnt the web
[09:21:34] <mikesherov> sure, it's not
[09:21:35] <rwaldron> and ya know... i develop for the web
[09:21:38] <rwaldron> :P
[09:21:50] <mikesherov> but I thought, as do a bunch of people I'd guess, that since it's JS, no need to run on a server
[09:21:51] <rwaldron> i had this same conversation during the early dev stages of popcorn
[09:21:53] <DaveMethvin> on that stuff, let's just make sure the unit test process is documented enough...
[09:22:02] <DaveMethvin> so people know what to expect
[09:22:04] <rwaldron> students where running the suite in Firefox from file://.
[09:22:15] <rwaldron> and coudnt figure out why video files wouldnt serve
[09:22:18] * rwaldron shudders
[09:22:23] <mikesherov> I can whip up a PR real quick that displays a message
[09:22:30] <rwaldron> Yeah, good call
[09:22:35] <rwaldron> i think we should also drop isLocal
[09:22:48] <JohnResig> the isLocal stuff was mostly in to make sure that people didn't try to run the tests innapropriately - but at the same time you honeslty don't need a web server for the majority of the tests, so why not let them run on file:// anyway?
[09:23:00] <mikesherov> I agree with John
[09:23:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah isLocal can be convenient
[09:23:15] <DaveMethvin> just need to be clear about what you lose
[09:23:16] <DaveMethvin> mostly ajax
[09:23:17] <mikesherov> I think what's needed is just a message at the top of the suite
[09:23:19] <rwaldron> \o/
[09:23:20] <timmywil> that's fine, but i hope we're not talking about an alert or something
[09:23:21] <rwaldron> ok
[09:23:31] <mikesherov> How about 10 alerts in a row
[09:23:36] <DaveMethvin> core dump would get your attention
[09:23:40] <JohnResig> yeah, just a notice at the top would be great
[09:23:45] <timmywil> ok
[09:23:46] <rwaldron> Honestly, I don't expect everyone to adhere to my lunatic "testing for the web should use the web" ideals
[09:23:49] <rwaldron> ;)
[09:23:52] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: the blog post is looking pretty good
[09:24:01] <DaveMethvin> feel free to edit guys
[09:24:07] <DaveMethvin> or add questions/comments
[09:24:30] <DaveMethvin> i didn't want to commit us to a very specific strategy but let them know we were looking at Closure Compiler for example
[09:25:30] <timmywil> sounds good
[09:25:38] <DaveMethvin> well that's about it for me, anyone have anything else? Please do look at the blog post, i'd like to put it up in the next day or so
[09:25:45] <DaveMethvin> but i didn't want to do two on the same day
[09:25:51] <DaveMethvin> but i think w'll have 1.7.1 out tonight
[09:25:57] <DaveMethvin> and i can put that one out tomorrow
[09:26:19] <mikesherov> so is the agenda just to review 1.7.1 and the blog post?
[09:26:24] <mikesherov> and to welcome me ;-)?
[09:26:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and who brought cake?
[09:26:36] <timmywil> pretty much
[09:26:46] <JohnResig> hehe
[09:26:53] <mikesherov> Well, I just wanted to say thanks to you guys for helping me get up to speed
[09:27:01] <timmywil> JohnResig brought a banana
[09:27:04] <mikesherov> and I look forward to contributing more
[09:27:14] <rwaldron> JohnResig once dressed as a banana
[09:27:16] <rwaldron> i have pictures
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> we're glad you are helping out mikesherov
[09:27:20] <JohnResig> that's true
[09:27:33] <mikesherov> Do I get my name on this nifty little page: http://jquery.org/team/ ?
[09:27:36] <DaveMethvin> was he that dancing banana guy?
[09:27:40] <DaveMethvin> yes you do!
[09:27:45] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin actually... yes he was
[09:27:46] <mikesherov> Peanut Butter Jelly Time?
[09:27:46] <ajpiano> mikesherov: already working on it
[09:27:49] <ajpiano> :D
[09:28:04] <DaveMethvin> man that ajpiano is fast!
[09:28:20] <mikesherov> ajpiano works like 1 mile from me
[09:28:43] <timmywil> thanks all
[09:28:56] <DaveMethvin> ok, see you back in -dev!
