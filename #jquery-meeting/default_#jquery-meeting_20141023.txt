[11:06:30] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: oh you changed your name didnt you it was ldeluca before right?
[11:06:40] <arschmitz> i was going to ping you but i didnt see your name
[11:06:52] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: yea, figured it'd be nice if you all knew my first name
[11:07:00] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: then i was debating putting my twitter handle to stay consistent
[11:07:05] <lisa_deluca> still not sure the route I'll take :)
[11:07:18] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: lol
[11:07:40] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: You can't do worse than _|Nix|_ (my original nick) :)
[11:07:42] <arschmitz> ok just a sec ill get the agenda
[11:07:56] <agcolom> My internet connection is not great... cant connect to the agenda
[11:08:23] <gabriel_schulhof> :(
[11:08:26] <arschmitz> agenda https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdG5nSmZiSUhjYm4ya29CdjhLZmJwSWc&usp=drive_web#gid=49
[11:08:26] <agcolom> or is there a pb with google?
[11:08:41] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: I'm afraid not.
[11:08:52] <agcolom> I can't seem to be able to establish a secure connection...
[11:09:09] <arschmitz> 1.4.5
[11:09:23] <arschmitz> im going to review all the current 1.4.5 prs after the meeting
[11:09:37] <gabriel_schulhof> *whew*
[11:10:19] * agcolom getting a message saying google drive is unreachable... SO I won't be able to take notes today
[11:10:28] <arschmitz> there are 13 so i might not finish until tomorrow
[11:11:08] <arschmitz> but lets try to land these and release end of next week
[11:11:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Absolutely!
[11:11:53] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll have another look at 1.4.5 issues to see which ones don't have a PR yet.
[11:12:06] <arschmitz> ok
[11:12:11] <arschmitz> so 1.5
[11:12:21] <arschmitz> 2 big things here this week
[11:12:27] <arschmitz> LOTS of updates on the UI side
[11:12:42] <arschmitz> all of which are pulled all the way through now to mobile
[11:12:58] <arschmitz> which brings us to the second thing
[11:13:14] <arschmitz> collapsible / sets options are out of control
[11:13:25] <gabriel_schulhof> ... to put it mildly :)
[11:13:27] <arschmitz> and its just a bad design having this as 2 widgets
[11:13:43] <arschmitz> and this leads to extra unneed markup too
[11:13:46] <gabriel_schulhof> They are warping the very fabric of spacetime.
[11:13:56] <arschmitz> so we will be deprecated them in 1.5
[11:14:03] <arschmitz> and replacing them with the ui accordion
[11:14:09] <arschmitz> there will be no backcompat
[11:14:17] <arschmitz> they will just both exist for 1.5
[11:14:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't have enough thumbs to raise.
[11:14:59] <cgack> two thumbs from me
[11:15:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Good. That's good. I'm starting a collection :)
[11:15:39] <arschmitz> so we will be needing some CSS for accordion
[11:15:57] <arschmitz> which is why i pinged sfrisk today
[11:16:03] <sfrisk> allo
[11:16:09] <arschmitz> she has very kindly agreed to handle this for us
[11:16:34] <arschmitz> sfrisk: has also been working on a new css style guide for contribute as well as helping with the css framework a bit
[11:16:57] <gabriel_schulhof> sfrisk: Awesome! Thanks!
[11:17:13] <sfrisk> Glad to help
[11:17:57] <arschmitz> i just opened an issue to track this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7798
[11:18:06] <arschmitz> ill update with more details shortly
[11:19:21] <arschmitz> so this means we will now be using 5 ui widgets in mobile 1.5
[11:19:28] <arschmitz> kinda fitting actually :-)
[11:19:57] <gabriel_schulhof> I was just gonna say: Philosophically, it goes with our stated mantra of reducing frameworks. I mean, we're starting in our own house.
[11:20:07] <gabriel_schulhof> goes well, even.
[11:20:33] <arschmitz> yeah duplicated effort is an understatment when it comes to ui and mobile right now
[11:20:58] <arschmitz> but thats all changing
[11:22:19] <arschmitz> ok so on the issues front
[11:22:30] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: has been plowing through old issues this week
[11:22:50] <arschmitz> we were under 400 again but then i opened one :)
[11:22:54] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:23:22] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you need to find 2 more issues to close today :)
[11:23:35] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: mission accepted
[11:24:17] <arschmitz> awesome!
[11:26:33] <arschmitz> no update on css this week jasper could not make it
[11:26:48] <arschmitz> we have closed a few more cordova issue again thanks to lisa_deluca
[11:27:09] <arschmitz> on the jsbin front
[11:27:25] <arschmitz> we will be switching to a branded jquery mobile jsbin for sure
[11:27:42] <arschmitz> however still working out exactly how this will work because ui wants to switch too
[11:28:17] <arschmitz> and we are talking about having all the examples in the ui demos api etc actually be jsbins
[11:28:53] <arschmitz> which will get generated via build script and an api with jsbin
[11:29:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Ooh! That's neat!
[11:29:42] <arschmitz> nothing is for sure yet but this would add the edit in jsbin link to every one
[11:29:50] <arschmitz> so you could click into them and play with them
[11:30:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We could replace our "View Source".
[11:30:15] <arschmitz> yes
[11:30:41] <arschmitz> but thats something we still need to talk to remy about and the api does not officially exist yet :)
[11:31:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, I wouldn't go so far. Let's include an "Edit" button in the "View Source" popup.
[11:31:05] <arschmitz> but likely nothing will happen with out cobranded jsbin until more is worked out here
[11:35:57] <arschmitz> ok so i think thats it this week
[11:36:05] <arschmitz> any one have anything else?
[11:36:23] <agcolom> nope. I hope you took notes?
[11:36:35] <arschmitz> agcolom: i got it
[11:36:41] <agcolom> thx :-)
[11:37:13] <cgack> arschmitz: i finally merged the navbar-review branch from my fork
[11:37:25] <arschmitz> cgack: awesome
[11:38:10] <arschmitz> anything from the community?
[11:38:22] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and I've gotten the classes _setOptions to update the corresponding style options in a few of the PRs.
[11:38:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: awesome
[11:48:01] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll close the channel ...
[11:48:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Back to -dev ...
