[11:04:43] <uGoMobi> hi all
[11:04:48] <agcolom> hi!
[11:04:50] <gseguin> hey
[11:04:55] <arschmitz> hi
[11:05:22] <five> Good morning :-)
[11:05:31] <frequent> hi
[11:06:27] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:06:31] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kg0RDJ4hgRR8SgmTelg0btWyZG4XEI-ogvucq5Hjq7I/edit?usp=sharing
[11:07:47] <uGoMobi> if you have anything you want to discuss you can add it in the agenda ^^^
[11:08:02] <uGoMobi> I think everyone is here so let's get started
[11:08:16] <uGoMobi> 1.4 alpha has been released last week!
[11:08:19] <uGoMobi> yeahhhhh
[11:08:37] <uGoMobi> seriously nice work all!
[11:08:47] <toddmparker> w00t
[11:08:53] <toddmparker> awesome work
[11:09:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: already on vacation or joining the meeting?
[11:10:02] <uGoMobi> let's discuss the issues that have been reported
[11:10:46] <uGoMobi> the tickets were mostly about new filterable widget and panels
[11:11:16] <uGoMobi> and an issue with the icons on Android 2.x
[11:11:17] <gseguin> There was also a an issue with the builder 'caused by wrong pragmas, right?
[11:11:28] <arschmitz> yup
[11:11:35] <gseguin> is that fixed?
[11:11:36] <arschmitz> wrong css file name in flipswitch
[11:12:04] <arschmitz> will be in about 30 seconds
[11:12:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[11:12:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On and of.
[11:12:12] <_|Nix|_> off.
[11:12:16] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[11:12:42] <uGoMobi> any big issues that are a real concern?
[11:13:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not that I'm aware of.
[11:13:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm in favour of a beta next week, but let's discuss.
[11:13:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: Fixed
[11:13:41] <gseguin> thanks arschmitz
[11:14:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think we need another alpha for auto init?
[11:15:32] <gseguin> got to drop off soon, I working on build / release stuff. Hopefully I'll be done with it before the next release
[11:15:43] <arschmitz> i would lean towards yes because it changes SOOOO much
[11:15:53] <arschmitz> and deprecates some things
[11:16:00] <toddmparker> seems big enough...
[11:16:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, you fixed that? Thanks!
[11:16:09] <arschmitz> it touches almost every js file
[11:16:22] <toddmparker> what is the commitment re: API changes on alpha vs. beta in server?
[11:16:33] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yup fixed the lint and  sneaked in a micro-optimization
[11:16:36] <toddmparker> or is that not covered?
[11:16:38] <arschmitz> public api should not change
[11:16:45] <arschmitz> but internal stuff you can do whatever
[11:16:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Swoosh! Nice!
[11:17:08] <arschmitz> and this deprecates being able to call "change" on a container and adds a public method for it
[11:17:20] <arschmitz> $.fn.enhanceWithin()
[11:17:31] <_|Nix|_> OK. I gotta go now. Gotta be at the airport at 05:15 AM. Have a ton of fun guys. It has been a lot of work, but I think the result is AWESOME!
[11:17:33] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:17:38] <toddmparker> bye _|Nix|_
[11:17:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: enjoy your vacation!
[11:18:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have fun
[11:18:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what's the status of auto init?
[11:18:29] <arschmitz> done
[11:18:32] <uGoMobi> when could we release?
[11:18:43] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:18:46] <arschmitz> just waiting for scott to take a look before i go any further
[11:18:55] <arschmitz> per the dev meeting last week
[11:19:08] <arschmitz> also Pinged jorn on it
[11:19:43] <arschmitz> i did a pr for the changes to ui for it and those have been merged already
[11:20:31] <uGoMobi> I am in favor of doing Alpha 2
[11:20:35] <arschmitz> the change to ui also makes it possible for us to implement the new jquery plugin amd pattern we will be switching to
[11:20:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: +!
[11:20:40] <uGoMobi> also because of the panel issues
[11:20:41] <arschmitz> +1
[11:20:59] <toddmparker> sounds reasonable to me +1
[11:21:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah and it will give us a chance to make any minor api tweaks we see fit after this first alpha
[11:21:11] <uGoMobi> and I am going to make a change in theme inheritance, to make widgets outside page inherit a theme
[11:21:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: timeframe what were you thinking?
[11:21:40] <uGoMobi> mid next week?
[11:21:53] <uGoMobi> Wednesday?
[11:21:59] <arschmitz> ok i had been thinking next thursday but either is fine
[11:22:23] <arschmitz> i like thursdays because we have the meeting right before and it gives us one last chance to discuss issues lol
[11:22:24] <uGoMobi> yeah Wed or Thu
[11:22:35] <uGoMobi> sure
[11:22:45] <arschmitz> dont think it honestly makes much difference though
[11:23:09] <uGoMobi> I will look into panel issues
[11:23:26] <uGoMobi> we also have to start updating the API docs and Demo Center
[11:23:34] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: let me know if you want a set of eyes on anything theme/design related
[11:23:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok as always ping me with the extra time i might poke into panels also
[11:23:39] <uGoMobi> and make an upgrade guide
[11:24:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: autoinit breaks our top search by the way but think i just need to switch its initselector just have not looked yet
[11:24:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: maybe you guys can look into that icon issue on Android
[11:24:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I am not really worried about that... lots of things broken
[11:26:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: what do you think about new default theme contrast, etc? tweaks are welcome!
[11:26:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: happy to look at the android issueâ€¦was 2.3 w/ new icons?
[11:26:29] <toddmparker> is there an issue #?
[11:26:40] <uGoMobi> yes there is a ticket
[11:26:44] <uGoMobi> one sec
[11:27:06] <arschmitz> toddmparker: feel free to ping me to test on that i have a bunch of 2.2 and 2.3 devices
[11:27:11] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, i'll look at theming a bit to see if I have suggestions. noticed the panel demos seem to do odd things. like the panel bg affects part of the page too
[11:27:15] <toddmparker> (when open)
[11:27:20] <toddmparker> dunno if just a demo thing
[11:27:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6215
[11:27:24] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6215 by frequent (5d 5h ago): 1.4.0 - svg icons not displaying on Android 2.3.1
[11:27:42] <frequent> uGoMobi: yes, I'm not seeing anything
[11:27:46] <frequent> icon-wise
[11:28:03] <toddmparker> i think my phone is 2.3.4
[11:28:11] <toddmparker> i can see if browerstack has that vintage
[11:28:16] <godswearhats> Is there anything useful a new guy can do?
[11:28:17] <toddmparker> brb
[11:29:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: awesome! note that many demos are broken because we didn't update the custom CSS yet
[11:29:13] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: always!
[11:29:16] <arschmitz> godswearhats: look at bugs, triage, and submit PR's are some of the best ways to start getting involved
[11:29:31] <uGoMobi> sorry, my IRC is delayed :/
[11:29:41] <godswearhats> Will do :-)
[11:29:50] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: thanks!
[11:29:57] <godswearhats> np
[11:30:00] <arschmitz> godswearhats: awesome we look forward to any help
[11:30:05] <godswearhats> Thank me when I do something ;-)
[11:30:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I saw I killed navbar buttons
[11:30:38] <uGoMobi> and frequent fixed it with a PR?
[11:30:43] <arschmitz> its a change in the JS not sure if it was you or not
[11:30:43] <frequent> uGoMobi: I will make another demo page for #6215 and try to see if I can poke something.
[11:31:01] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok cool
[11:31:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I only had a quick look, but I am pretty sure it has to do with how I declared the var
[11:31:41] <uGoMobi> but thanks for fixing it :)
[11:32:08] <uGoMobi> frequent: are there still big issues with filterable?
[11:32:14] <uGoMobi> I just commented on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6225#issuecomment-21958148
[11:32:14] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6225 by RedWolves (3d 16h ago): Filter: Filtering a SELECT element causes unexpected experience
[11:32:45] <frequent> uGoMobi: the form submitting on return and list-dividers notbeing filtered anymore as far as I can tell
[11:32:48] <frequent> (without looking)
[11:33:04] <frequent> uGoMobi: form I will try to fix.
[11:33:16] <godswearhats> I should be looking at issues for 1.4.0 milestone?
[11:33:19] <frequent> uGoMobi: what about the list-dividers?
[11:33:30] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok, that would be great
[11:33:34] <toddmparker> (ok, back)
[11:34:04] <uGoMobi> frequent: I think _|Nix|_ moved the code that handles the dividers into an extension
[11:35:08] <frequent> uGoMobi: hm. I can have a look, too
[11:35:36] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:35:40] <frequent> uGoMobi: about the select .... I originally hid the whole select when all elements were filtered away.
[11:36:15] <frequent> I know it's a change of API (thx _|Nix|_), but it "made sense" to me
[11:36:17] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: let's talk on the #jqueryui-dev channel after the meeting
[11:37:01] <godswearhats> uGoMobi: Roger that!
[11:37:08] <uGoMobi> frequent: hmm, what I don't really like is when a hidden option is still submitted
[11:37:41] <frequent> uGoMobi: good point.
[11:38:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok we can discuss this later on -dev
[11:38:18] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. let me think...
[11:38:21] <frequent> yeah.
[11:38:25] <uGoMobi> same goes for two other issues
[11:38:37] <uGoMobi> anything else we need to discuss here?
[11:38:51] <frequent> #6215 (broken icons) test page here: http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/bugs/6215/index.html.
[11:38:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom is making good progress on the new web site
[11:39:15] <agcolom> yes ;-)
[11:39:15] <uGoMobi> and RWhitbeck is working on that too
[11:39:16] <agcolom> I'm on holiday (from work) until the 4th Sept
[11:39:26] <RWhitbeck> oh hai
[11:39:41] <agcolom> I'll be offline for a few days soon, but still not sure when exactly...
[11:39:49] <agcolom> (while traveling)
[11:39:56] <uGoMobi> thanks frequent ! can you post at issue?
[11:40:10] <frequent> (writing)
[11:40:15] <uGoMobi> cool :)
[11:40:43] <toddmparker> re: the broken icons, frequent - is that using the loader or just the basic css that has svg + pointers to the external PNGs?
[11:40:46] <uGoMobi> it looks like we will be able to switch to new WordPress site when we release 1.4 final
[11:41:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great news
[11:41:05] <uGoMobi> might still need some work after that, but at least we will have the new theme
[11:41:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: re the new site, we're in good shape...
[11:41:25] <toddmparker> agcolom: is there a preview up?
[11:41:38] <agcolom> stage.jquerymobile.com
[11:41:42] <frequent> toddmparker: I just "copied" the download files (js/css), so there are now fallback .png images
[11:41:57] <agcolom> I'll do the remaining changelogs...
[11:41:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, that's what I think too
[11:42:17] <agcolom> Someone needs to look at moving the blog and the download-builder
[11:42:30] <arschmitz> frequent: if you host the css locally you need to copy all the pngs also
[11:42:39] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: so did you add the more advanced loader as an option is the combined css the currently way
[11:42:41] <frequent> toddmparker: hm.
[11:42:44] <agcolom> and I'm not sure who that is
[11:43:03] <agcolom> gseguin: are you moving the download builder to the new site?
[11:43:04] <frequent> toddmparker:but if I just use the snippet on the blog website? (tries)
[11:43:24] <gseguin> agcolom: we will probably need gnarf's help for that
[11:43:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: alpha has the combined CSS with inline SVG and external PNG fallback
[11:43:40] <agcolom> right, yes...
[11:43:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we still have to change the build script
[11:43:48] <gseguin> the builder is actually hosted on a different machine
[11:43:53] <toddmparker> wondering if android 2.x thinks it can handle SVG and the real grunt icon loader weeds it out
[11:43:53] <uGoMobi> so we have 4 CSS files
[11:43:55] <agcolom> is there anything else missing?
[11:44:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I copied the real grunt loader
[11:44:14] <gnarf> agcolom: gseguin nothing really changes yes? check with scott_gonzalez or rxaviers about the ui DB integration maybe?
[11:44:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I only removed something that was added for Firefox 3.6
[11:44:26] <toddmparker> ok, so that test page should have the real loader in play
[11:44:35] <uGoMobi> basically yes
[11:44:38] <toddmparker> ok
[11:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> For what?
[11:44:44] <toddmparker> we'll give it a look then
[11:44:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thanks!
[11:45:00] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: moving the download-builder to the new site
[11:45:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i found the issue with test page
[11:45:25] <arschmitz> frequent: ^^
[11:45:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think we also have to tweak some of the new icons
[11:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I don't konw anything about how the Mobile download builder works.
[11:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> I do know that there are changes that need to happen.
[11:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> Like the repo needs to be public.
[11:45:45] <arschmitz> the png's are not found
[11:45:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we can give that a look before beta, and discuss with Joseph
[11:46:06] <arschmitz> you can reproduce right in chrome by adding class ui-nosvg to html
[11:46:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is it an issue with the path?
[11:46:27] <frequent> arschmitz: well spotted. I was poking around that, too.
[11:46:32] <arschmitz> no looks like frequent didnt copy the png's just js and css
[11:46:44] <uGoMobi> aha, the PNGs are not on the server
[11:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is this the download builder? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder
[11:47:04] <frequent> uGoMobi: correct
[11:47:11] <frequent> and not in the downloadable zip either
[11:47:34] <agcolom> gseguin: see scott_gonzalez's question...
[11:47:35] <uGoMobi> there was also someone who saw the issue on Android 2.2... I guess same problem
[11:47:36] <frequent> (just downloaded)
[11:47:44] <uGoMobi> (I closed as duplicate I think)
[11:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> If the entire thing is a single page with no server use, then it should move into jquerymobile.com/jquery-wp-content
[11:47:52] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez:  that's the ui for it
[11:48:10] <gseguin> the server piece is in gseguin/node-amd-builder
[11:48:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah images are missing from zip it looks like gseguin: the builder probably needs to be updated to include them
[11:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> And how is that getting on servers right now?
[11:48:47] <frequent> uGoMobi: I need to go... Talk to you on dev. Bye!
[11:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> That needs to move to something like download.jquerymobile.com.
[11:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> And be managed by pupet.
[11:49:06] <uGoMobi> frequent: later !
[11:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> (The generic portions don't need to move, you just need an implementation in a jquery repo)
[11:50:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: "PNGs are not on the server" - so that would do it :)
[11:50:29] <uGoMobi> yeah, might help :)
[11:50:49] <uGoMobi> ok, anything else we need to discuss here?
[11:51:10] <uGoMobi> any questions from the community?
[11:52:00] <uGoMobi> ok let's wrap up here
[11:52:05] <uGoMobi> thanks all!
[11:52:09] <uGoMobi> see you on -dev
[11:53:46] <agcolom> we need to close the channel...
[11:54:03] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: please :-)
