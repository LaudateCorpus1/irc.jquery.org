[09:06:17] <gnarf> so i unmuted the channel
[09:06:20] <fnagel> nice
[09:06:22] <gnarf> so UI could meet
[09:06:53] <gnarf> was there anything we should talk about?
[09:06:58] <fnagel> I would need some info from either jörn or scott :-(
[09:07:12] <fnagel> Regarding selectmenu
[09:07:15] <gnarf> scott is out this week, jörn is afk
[09:07:52] <fnagel> Ok, thanks for the info. I guess Im not helpful for all other topics...
[09:08:22] <kborchers> gnarf: we can probably just wait 'till next week i think unless anyone has anything urgent
[09:09:10] <fnagel> Nothing really urgent, some question in wiki I cant answer myself. I guess next week is ok
[09:09:36] <kborchers> fnagel: link to the question?
[09:09:57] <fnagel> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[09:10:02] <fnagel> both comment threads
[09:12:16] <kborchers> fnagel: i agree that looping the keyboard interaction seems wrong … native selects don't do that so we shouldn't either
[09:12:23] <fnagel> Both are more like a "we need a decision" questions, thats why I called for jörn or scott
[09:12:50] <fnagel> yes, we disacussed this and ended up "perhaps later" or "perhaps Menu will have that someday".
[09:13:51] <kborchers> fnagel: yeah, i believe that "feature" should be pulled out of menu since native menus don't seem to loop either
[09:15:13] <kborchers> fnagel: for the second thread, i think a beforeClose would be nice to have but would say wait for input from Jörn on that one
[09:16:28] <fnagel> Thats what I thought too, but I know jörn and espacially scott have their opinions about new and less used options and callbacks
[09:18:42] <kborchers> anything else?
[09:19:37] <kborchers> ok back to -dev
