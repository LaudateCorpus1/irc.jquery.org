[11:02:32] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof gseguin agcolom cgack
[11:02:35] <gseguin> ha! you beat me to it jasperdegroot
[11:02:42] <agcolom> good evening!
[11:02:44] <cgack> howdy
[11:02:45] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: :P
[11:02:51] <jasperdegroot> hey all
[11:02:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Yo ho ho and a barrel of grog!
[11:03:03] <gseguin> hiya
[11:03:23] <jasperdegroot> we released 1.4.3
[11:03:29] <gseguin> yay!
[11:03:31] <jasperdegroot> WOOHOOO
[11:03:51] <gseguin> and it was pretty smooth release once arschmitz fixed all the demo issues
[11:03:52] <gabriel_schulhof> *pop* ... *blubblubblubblub* ... *fizzzzz*
[11:03:57] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: I saw you opened a PR for the API docs
[11:04:03] <agcolom> yes
[11:04:11] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/321
[11:04:35] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: great, thanks
[11:04:37] <gseguin> b-ot: you're a lazy bastard
[11:04:51] <jasperdegroot> I have to admit I did't check the release checklist
[11:04:59] <agcolom> :-)
[11:05:01] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: Did you use the script to change the version?
[11:05:10] <agcolom> no,
[11:05:19] <agcolom> I didn't know there was a script, sorry...
[11:05:22] <jasperdegroot> not sure if it's in there
[11:05:30] <agcolom> I did all by hand...
[11:05:37] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: NP, as long as it's complete. The script is mostly for convenience.
[11:05:40] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: what script?
[11:05:42] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: That's actually a good thing.
[11:05:52] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: You can spot idiosyncrasies that way.
[11:05:58] <agcolom> yes,
[11:06:04] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: IIRC there's a script for updating the version numbers in the examples.
[11:06:06] <agcolom> I get nervous otherwise!
[11:06:29] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: set-lib-versions.sh
[11:07:10] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: can you add the info here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[11:08:02] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: To the top section?
[11:08:17] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: There's some blurb there regarding post-1.4 versions.
[11:08:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Not sure if that applies to API docs.
[11:08:49] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I thought that was only about the release script
[11:08:49] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, there's nothing about API docs there.
[11:09:26] <agcolom> I could add something on the API docs, to highlight which files need updating and/or all files in directory xxx
[11:09:29] <jasperdegroot> anyway, we can clean it up
[11:09:29] <jasperdegroot> don't need a post 1.4 section
[11:10:19] <agcolom> gabriel_schulhof: ^ I could add something on the API docs, to highlight which files need updating and/or all files in directory xxx and then maybe you could add something on the script or vice versa...
[11:10:40] <agcolom> if you mention the script, I can say "make sure these get updated..."
[11:10:44] <agcolom> ?
[11:11:04] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist#api-docs
[11:11:09] <gabriel_schulhof> How about that?
[11:11:34] <agcolom> cool
[11:12:18] <agcolom> I can add a list of generic areas in the api docs that will be/should be updated
[11:13:09] <jasperdegroot> great
[11:13:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess in the case of a maintenance release it's not super-time-critical for the API docs to point to the latest version, but upon a minor release it's super important.
[11:14:00] <gabriel_schulhof> So it's good that we caught this.
[11:14:55] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:15:30] <jasperdegroot> anything about 1.5 development or other topics to discuss?
[11:16:21] <gabriel_schulhof> I wrote some unit tests for table and reflow.
[11:16:34] <gabriel_schulhof> So now table has both unit and integration tests.
[11:16:54] <gabriel_schulhof> They overlap at places, but the approach used in the unit tests is different from the approach used in the integration tests.
[11:17:12] <gabriel_schulhof> The unit tests are more code-oriented, whereas the integration tests are more holistic, behaviour-oriented.
[11:17:57] <jasperdegroot> ok cool
[11:18:08] <cgack> I tweaked some navbar css and did some browser/device testing, updated the demos page, need to finish some tests
[11:19:07] <jasperdegroot> cgack: awesome, thanks
[11:19:19] <cgack> i should probably start thinking about api docs too
[11:20:29] <jasperdegroot> cgack: yeah, but you might want to wait with that for now
[11:20:41] <jasperdegroot> until first review
[11:20:52] <cgack> good idea
[11:21:27] <jasperdegroot> so arschmitz is the new project lead from now on
[11:21:34] <jasperdegroot> but he is at vacation at the moment
[11:22:02] <jasperdegroot> I will write a blog post to announce it
[11:22:14] <jasperdegroot> can someone give this PR a :+1
[11:22:16] <jasperdegroot> https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/pull/93
[11:23:06] <gabriel_schulhof> ?BOOM
[11:23:09] <jasperdegroot> thanks
[11:23:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Some miscellaneous topics: I'm going to try to get web-ui-fw up to speed wrt. 1.4.3, and then maybe advertise it on jquerymobile.com. Also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d41vW2XbOmI related to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7539 ...
[11:23:54] <gabriel_schulhof> ... one of the first two post-1.4.3 bugs.
[11:24:35] <jasperdegroot> yeah, I saw that
[11:24:38] <jasperdegroot> weird bug
[11:25:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Probably some CSS parsing issue. Not sure we can fix that, and its fixed in at least 4.4.
[11:25:31] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: does it not occur with 1.4.2?
[11:25:39] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Good question.
[11:25:53] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: I can go back to older versions and check.
[11:25:56] <jasperdegroot> I can't think of any change we made that could cause this
[11:26:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[11:26:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Excellent point.
[11:26:15] <jasperdegroot> I think it should happen with 1.4.0 too
[11:26:19] <jasperdegroot> but you never know
[11:26:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, we've made lots of CSS changes, and one of them may be triggering an obscure Android bug.
[11:26:54] <gabriel_schulhof> All our changes were sane, of course, but with Android, you never know.
[11:27:26] <jasperdegroot> I'll put my money on "position: fixed" ;-)
[11:27:55] <jasperdegroot> anything else we have to discuss?
[11:28:01] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Well, in http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/511 there are no fixed elements, AFAICT.
[11:28:23] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyway, I'll go down the old-versions path, and I'll let you know if it's a regression.
[11:28:24] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: then I lost my money ;-)
[11:28:38] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: ok, great
[11:28:48] <gabriel_schulhof> It's good that we've only had two bugs so far.
[11:29:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Murphy, go back to sleep! You didn't hear anything!
[11:29:09] <jasperdegroot> :D
[11:29:12] <cgack> :)
[11:29:51] <jasperdegroot> was the other bug 1.4.3 specific?
[11:30:08] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: No, it's 1.4-specific.
[11:30:13] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:30:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Since we've introduced the dialog extension, the presence of ui-dialog on a page is no longer synonymous to our having to apply the special dialog nav logic.
[11:31:08] <gabriel_schulhof> We must instead check for the presence of a deprecated dialog widget on the page.
[11:31:33] <cgack> oh - I was going to ask if we should re-triage navigation bugs with the new stuff that landed with 1.4.3
[11:31:49] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Nono. This is unrelated to the new events.
[11:32:08] <jasperdegroot> cgack: I think most page event tickets were closed as duplicate
[11:32:21] <jasperdegroot> cgack: and the remaining one closed when arschmitz his PR landed
[11:32:23] <gabriel_schulhof> We'll have to update most of our tests to no longer rely on deprecated nav events.
[11:32:37] <cgack> okay good, just checking
[11:32:55] <gabriel_schulhof> s/nav/page/
[11:33:06] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: what you said about dialog makes me realize that we should decide if we are going to do a 1.4.4 or not
[11:33:33] <jasperdegroot> if not you can forget about the deprecated dialog
[11:33:36] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Well, if there's a decision to be made, let's land my PR for that bug and release 1.4.4 with a single bug fix.
[11:33:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and then go full steam on 1.5.0.
[11:33:54] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:33:58] <jasperdegroot> we have cgack his PR as well
[11:34:05] <jasperdegroot> for the toolbar issues
[11:34:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Well then we have good reason to release.
[11:34:22] <jasperdegroot> we didn't land that one, right?
[11:34:23] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:34:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and let's wait for at least another week to see if people find any 1.4.4-worthy bugs.
[11:35:01] <cgack> jasperdegroot: yeah toolbar _destroy was bumped to 1.4.4
[11:35:03] <jasperdegroot> even if it fixed just a few bugs it's worth releasing it
[11:35:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, especially since we have no ETA on 1.5.0.
[11:35:38] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:35:39] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and a /ton/ on our plate for it, I might add.
[11:35:45] <agcolom> just to have an idea, when do you think we'll be releasing 1.4.4 (roughly)?
[11:36:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Chicago ... *shrug* ... ?
[11:36:15] <jasperdegroot> why wait so long?
[11:36:35] <jasperdegroot> we can do that in august
[11:36:44] <jasperdegroot> but that's just my opinion
[11:36:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, if nobody finds a motherlode of bugs in 1.4.3, I don't see why not.
[11:37:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Although I'll be on vacation between August 8th and the 16th.
[11:38:06] <jasperdegroot> right, then we can't release in August ;-)
[11:38:13] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[11:38:37] <jasperdegroot> we have 0 demos issues this time, BTW
[11:38:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, actually, the contrary. Please release while I'm on vacation, so I can have a nice surprise when I get back :)
[11:38:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz dun good!
[11:39:14] <jasperdegroot> yeah, first release since long time that there isn't an issue with the demos
[11:39:17] <gabriel_schulhof> That spider was a cool idea.
[11:39:21] <jasperdegroot> for sure
[11:39:28] <jasperdegroot> very useful for all projects
[11:39:34] <jasperdegroot> and also for the website
[11:39:37] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Do we link to the demos from the blog post?
[11:39:49] <gabriel_schulhof> If not, maybe we should.
[11:40:13] * agcolom off to pick up Alex from rock climbing... catch you later. 
[11:40:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, when we introduce features or point out bug fixes, or something like that.
[11:40:15] <agcolom> will upload the minutes also this weekend or early next week (unless I find time tomorrow)
[11:40:19] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: K L8R
[11:40:30] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: ok thanks
[11:40:30] <gabriel_schulhof> agcolom: Thanks!
[11:40:39] <agcolom> let me know if you need me to review the blog post...
[11:40:43] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: no we don't link
[11:40:51] <jasperdegroot> agcolom: it's already online :)
[11:40:56] <agcolom> oops!
[11:41:32] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: those link were gone when we switch to new WordPress theme with different style for the blog posts, but we can add them back
[11:41:41] <jasperdegroot> links*
[11:41:58] <gabriel_schulhof> What do you mean "were gone"?
[11:42:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Do you mean "will be gone"?
[11:42:41] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I mean we had a format for the blog posts that included links to demos etc
[11:42:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I see.
[11:42:53] <jasperdegroot> that was part of the old theme
[11:43:06] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and the new theme renders the links as simply text?
[11:43:12] <jasperdegroot> well, the links were content
[11:43:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, not worth discussing in detail. I'm sure people browse the demos plenty.
[11:43:36] <jasperdegroot> not part of template
[11:43:45] <jasperdegroot> right
[11:43:53] <jasperdegroot> we can just add a link somewhere in the post
[11:44:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I was just thinking that now that our demos are so perfect, we can put more pressure on them, by raising their profile via the blog post.
[11:44:21] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:44:35] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm actually kinda serious.
[11:44:37] <jasperdegroot> ok, I think we can move back to -dev
[11:44:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. Let's continue on -dev.
