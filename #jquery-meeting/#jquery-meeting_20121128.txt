[08:59:31] <kborchers> hey all. we'll get started in just a minute
[09:00:54] <kborchers> so who's here. scott_gonzalez jzaefferer are probably not going to make it. rworth gnarf mikesherov anyone else?
[09:01:06] <gnarf> i'm here
[09:01:27] <mikesherov> here
[09:01:37] <gnarf> afk for like 5 tho, brb
[09:02:09] <kborchers> mikesherov: update on your work with gnarf on mergatron
[09:02:12] <jzaefferer> still here, probably going to leave in a few minutes
[09:02:33] <mikesherov> one sec
[09:02:51] <jzaefferer> I've gather some info while updating the agenda, so most should be in there already. The last two points are about scheduling meetings, maybe we can start with that
[09:03:07] <jzaefferer> Though for the interactions rewrite we need scott_gonzalez and Dave Stein (no even here)
[09:03:22] <kborchers> right â€¦ meeting adjourned :P
[09:04:13] <mikesherov> OK, so mergeatron
[09:04:31] <mikesherov> it's installed on jq03.jquery.com and attempting to monitor jquery/jquery
[09:04:46] <mikesherov> had a good start, but it's currently "stuck" and I haven't had time to figure out why
[09:04:53] <mikesherov> will be figuring it out shortly
[09:05:21] <mikesherov> after that, I then need to improve its multiple repo support
[09:05:42] * rxaviers here
[09:06:00] <mikesherov> at which point, once it's stable on core, we can roll it out to ui
[09:06:05] <mikesherov> and then continue deploying
[09:06:09] <gnarf> back
[09:06:12] <mikesherov> so that's all
[09:06:21] <kborchers> ok cool
[09:06:34] <tj_vantoll> Here as well.
[09:07:03] <kborchers> so it looks like jzaefferer has updates for almost everything in the agenda so can just run through quickly
[09:07:17] <kborchers> rxaviers: download builder/TR update
[09:07:18] <jzaefferer> lol: "I went to Hawaii for Thanksgiving. It was beautiful. There were palm
[09:07:18] <jzaefferer> trees, sandy beaches, beautiful reefs as far as the eye could see.
[09:07:18] <jzaefferer> There was not any menubar work done. I'll pick it back up this week."
[09:07:51] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:07:54] <kborchers> nice
[09:08:16] <rxaviers> well, for DB/TR, it's on multi versions work
[09:08:30] <kborchers> jzaefferer: menubar was moved to 1.11 right?
[09:08:58] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:09:07] <kborchers> really wish it was still in 1.10 with selectmenu. just seems to make sense there
[09:09:10] <jzaefferer> I blame you for taking so long on progressbar ;)
[09:09:27] <kborchers> i took my time because menubar was assigned :P
[09:09:48] <kborchers> and just been busy
[09:09:51] <gnarf> what was our target date for 1.10
[09:10:10] <kborchers> i think mid december, not sure if an actual date was set
[09:10:21] <gnarf> just checking
[09:10:25] <kborchers> for beta
[09:10:28] <kborchers> final in January
[09:10:53] <gnarf> is there a list of 1.10 blockers atm?
[09:11:16] <jzaefferer> gnarf: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[09:11:39] <jzaefferer> I tend to push Effects off to 1.11 as well, since there haven't been any updates for a while, unless I missed something
[09:11:47] <kborchers> gnarf: you are a blocker :P
[09:11:50] <jzaefferer> Same for classes option and demo system
[09:11:51] <gnarf> yeah i am
[09:11:52] <gnarf> damn
[09:12:01] <jzaefferer> Dialog, Progressbar and Selectmenu are all in good shape
[09:12:15] <jzaefferer> of the 72 tickets, there are no blockers: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.10.0&group=component&max=250&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=priority&col=version&report=17&order=priority
[09:13:10] <jzaefferer> heading out, will join on mobile once on the train...
[09:14:00] <gnarf> whats our minimum jQuery Core in 1.10 ? 1.6?
[09:14:06] <kborchers> ok moving on. rworth is 90% on new-css. anything else on that?
[09:14:12] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah i think so
[09:14:42] <gnarf> hrm
[09:15:40] <gnarf> I'm going to try and put some time into the effects tickets this week then
[09:15:59] <kborchers> gnarf: cool
[09:17:28] <kborchers> while we're on effects
[09:18:00] <kborchers> mikesherov: any word from petro on taking a stab at the clip/cloning stuff? maybe coordinate with gnarf?
[09:18:15] <mikesherov> petro?
[09:18:25] <mikesherov> he's in ui-dev
[09:18:28] <mikesherov> but not in meeting
[09:18:30] <mikesherov> one sec
[09:18:43] <kborchers> mikesherov: from last week "mike to ask petro if he wants to do it"
[09:19:10] <mikesherov> yeah hes in the office but i think hes in a meeting
[09:19:49] <kborchers> mikesherov: i'll leave the note for you to talk to him in there
[09:19:52] <mikesherov> i'll get with him on it this week
[09:20:02] <mikesherov> ok, i have to jet
[09:20:12] <kborchers> later mikesherov
[09:20:34] <mikesherov> highlights: -32 tickets, -11 PR's
[09:20:44] <mikesherov> 387 ticket total, 15 PR's total
[09:20:48] <kborchers> nice!
[09:20:52] <mikesherov> mostly large code review at this point
[09:21:19] <jzaefferer> There's a dialog ticket related to effects and the wrapper. That should be a good test for clip.
[09:21:19] <mikesherov> later guys
[09:21:23] <kborchers> later
[09:21:28] <rxaviers> Didnt had a chance to finish writing about TR/DB.. Dumping it here now
[09:21:32] <rxaviers> Details of the Multi verions are in PR 57 https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/57
[09:21:32] <rxaviers> We have two usability issues from the previous week, which we still have work in progress. Before actually implementing that, I took a time to re-organize ThemeRoller frontend app. It had common code that would be used in DB frontend app. So, it made more sense to orgazize it first (see PR 63 https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/63).
[09:21:32] <rxaviers> I'd say we have from 3 to 4 more hours to get multi versions.
[09:21:47] <kborchers> rxaviers: thanks, i was just about to come back to you :)
[09:22:03] <rxaviers> great, any question feel free to ask ;)
[09:23:45] <kborchers> dialog and progressbar updates are in the agenda and are both coming along
[09:24:18] <jzaefferer> I'll focus on fixing dialog tickets.
[09:24:55] <kborchers> i hope to have progressbar wrapped up soon. hope to get some time this weekend
[09:25:05] <jzaefferer> Also need to land a node-testswarm update. There's QUnit issues piling up, too.
[09:25:47] <jzaefferer> kborchers: we also need API docs update for progressbar
[09:26:09] <kborchers> is there an issue so we don't forget?
[09:26:48] <jzaefferer> For progressbar, no.
[09:27:11] <kborchers> ok, i put it in the agenda. i'll add to the roadmap list too
[09:27:13] <jzaefferer> Already have one for selectmenu though.
[09:27:59] <jzaefferer> Issue for api jqueryui. com should be enough
[09:28:23] <kborchers> already added to roadmap :) i'll add that issue to. more things to remind me :)
[09:28:33] <jzaefferer> Typing URLs is really annoying on this Android keyboard
[09:29:38] <kborchers> anyone around to talk about the browserstack issues?
[09:31:36] <kborchers> guess not
[09:32:04] <kborchers> i think that's about it other than a couple of meetings need to be scheduled but mike and scott aren't around
[09:32:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: btw, i would like to be in on that interaction rewrite meeting if possible but don't schedule around me
[09:33:06] <kborchers> anything else?
[09:33:38] * rxaviers is fine
[09:34:03] <kborchers> ok then. see you all in -dev
[11:01:36] <gnarf> Infra time!

[11:05:46] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: any update on backups?
[11:05:57] <ryanneufeld> I've been slammed at work
[11:06:16] <gnarf> yeah, i don't expect much this week with us turkey day anyway
[11:06:50] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I dunno how much use I'll be for the remainder of this year.  But I'm working on scheduling time to spend on things
[11:07:04] <ryanneufeld> so I'll add a block for infra stuff, the wife can deal
[11:07:14] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: lemme know if you need to back out on any of the tasks on your plate cuz of time
[11:07:36] <ryanneufeld> The zabbix thing.. can you take that?
[11:07:40] <gnarf> sure
[11:08:00] <ryanneufeld> well, before i say that. I'm gonna block off my evening to work on infra tonight
[11:08:06] <ryanneufeld> will you be around?
[11:08:11] <gnarf> 50/50
[11:08:30] <gnarf> as always, try a skype ping if i'm dead here
[11:08:31] <clarkbox> ill be back and forth if there is anything i can help with ryan
[11:08:47] <ryanneufeld> Thank clarkbox
[11:08:58] <gnarf> so, we will be upgrading to wordpress 3.5 rc1 on jq01 today
[11:09:02] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I added you to the meeting invite, not sure what the times are like
[11:09:06] <ryanneufeld> so I'll ping
[11:09:23] <gnarf> at some point
[11:09:27] <gnarf> prolly late night
[11:09:29] <gnarf> just in case
[11:09:35] <gnarf> lots of "live" sites there now
[11:09:44] <clarkbox> what host(s) will that affect?
[11:09:55] <clarkbox> hosts/ aka sites
[11:10:06] <clarkbox> ill make sure splunk is logging them
[11:10:16] <gnarf> clarkbox: everything on jq01 :)
[11:10:37] <gnarf> clarkbox: jquery.com api.jqueryui.com jqueryui.com qunitjs.com api.qunitjs.com sizzlejs.com
[11:10:40] <gnarf> i think maybe more
[11:10:46] <gnarf> but yeah
[11:10:47] <clarkbox> ok
[11:11:21] <gnarf> i'm most worried about this strange redirect loop on live at the moment
[11:11:45] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: loop?
[11:11:46] <gnarf> might need nacin to help me hunt this one down, because its the PHP thats serving the redirect, not nginx
[11:11:54] <gnarf> http://jquery.com/wp-admin/network/ fails
[11:12:07] <ryanneufeld> ahh
[11:12:15] <ryanneufeld> yeah, not gonna be much help there.
[11:12:33] <gnarf> infinite redirection
[11:12:37] <gnarf> i don't get it
[11:12:42] <gnarf> because i can't reproduce it locally
[11:13:02] <clarkbox> i don't see redirectâ€¦? is it obvious?
[11:14:11] <clarkbox> or does it happen after login?
[11:14:41] <gnarf> after login
[11:15:14] <gnarf> (check pm)
[11:15:26] <gnarf> any thoughts, lets hash em out in -infra after
[11:15:42] <gnarf> clarkbox: any update on splunk? I saw you and krinkle kicking out some serious reports there
[11:16:00] <gnarf> i really like the testswarm-browserstack stuff that landed
[11:16:01] <clarkbox> ya I'm doing some stuff on it ever day
[11:16:07] <clarkbox> ya its pretty cool
[11:16:11] <clarkbox> there is a lot i want to do
[11:16:15] <clarkbox> it will basically never end
[11:16:20] <clarkbox> too much data. so little time
[11:16:36] <gnarf> any big developments this week worth mentioning in the status?
[11:16:40] <clarkbox> working with jorn on download-builder page
[11:17:13] <clarkbox> btw, crossed the 1/2 mill mark for jquery ui downloads yesterday
[11:17:23] <clarkbox> but thats about all
[11:17:40] <gnarf> nice
[11:17:54] <gnarf> clarkbox: one thing i want to do
[11:18:01] <gnarf> i was trying to figure out how to get a good search for it
[11:18:12] <gnarf> but the notify server logs to syslog the exit code of all deploys
[11:18:31] <gnarf> i would really like to have a nice listing of the non-zeros
[11:18:53] <clarkbox> hmm. is that exit code in the log file?
[11:18:57] <gnarf> yup
[11:19:12] <clarkbox> ok cool. just give me the path and ill build something for it
[11:19:32] <gnarf> cat /var/log/messages | grep notifier | grep exit
[11:19:38] <clarkbox> nice
[11:19:55] <gnarf> the hard part is
[11:20:13] <gnarf> the actual output is kinda a pain to read there
[11:20:22] <gnarf> which is why i created the deploy@jquery.com email
[11:20:27] <gnarf> i don't remember if i added you
[11:20:31] <gnarf> have you been getting them?
[11:21:33] <clarkbox> no i don't think so
[11:21:42] <gnarf> do you want them?
[11:21:44] <clarkbox> â€¦checking filters/spam
[11:21:48] <clarkbox> sure
[11:22:33] <clarkbox> might be something that would be good to turn into an alert in splunk. each person could tune the search and only receive relevant alerts...
[11:24:21] <clarkbox> i gotta run to pick up my kid from school. ill read through buffer when i get backâ€¦
[11:24:32] <gnarf> k
[11:24:36] <gnarf> i think we are done
[11:24:41] <gnarf> unless someone else has new business
[11:26:31] <gnarf> see ya in -infra
