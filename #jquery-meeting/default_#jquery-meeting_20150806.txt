[09:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz M4rius: Looks like it's just us right now.
[09:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano gnarf: How do we get b-ot to join?
[09:02:55] <gnarf> ping gf3 - it should auto-join this channel on restart - I don't know why it keeps disappearing
[09:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> hey snover
[09:03:32] <snover> hello
[09:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> I was out at a training the past few days, so I'm catching up on what's going on.
[09:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like jdalton is waiting for another round of review for the test automation.
[09:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> Any update on touch-action?
[09:09:37] <arschmitz> here sorry
[09:09:46] <arschmitz> no i didnt have any time this week to get to it
[09:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, still being a bit behind, I don't have anything on the agenda.
[09:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything to discuss?
[09:10:19] <arschmitz> i did open one semi related issue
[09:10:59] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/212
[09:11:50] <arschmitz> but no one has commented on it
[09:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm....seems like a reasonable thing to add.
[09:17:16] <jrossi1> yup look like a good idea to me
[09:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else to discuss today?
[09:19:25] <jrossi1> just FYI, I have more feedback on https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1949, so we're still blocked in https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/168
[09:19:52] <jrossi1> also PR168 seems to be failing CI, but I haven't looked into the failures
[09:21:43] <arschmitz> Cool ill do a pr for that when i do the touch-action one probably
[09:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> jrossi1: You have feedback you're going to add to the wpt PR?
[09:23:51] <jrossi1> yes
[09:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:24:00] <jrossi1> i only saw one issue
[09:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> Is that all for today?
[09:27:53] <arschmitz> i dont have anything else
[09:28:08] <jrossi1> Yay: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/pointer-events-now-in-firefox-nightly/
[09:28:19] <arschmitz> oh awesome
[09:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> yay :-)
[09:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess that's all.
[09:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
[11:00:59] <arschmitz> agcolom: cgack: gabrielschulhof: jasperdegroot: apsdehal: sfrisk: meeting time
[11:01:10] <apsdehal> hi
[11:01:12] <sfrisk> (in work meeting but I'll be here in spirit)
[11:01:15] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGEVtftLDEHAA37YYlA23J_EZwIRyMUaseBY790byPM/edit#gid=2100133419
[11:01:20] <jasperdegroot> hi all
[11:01:20] <arschmitz> agenda ^^
[11:02:42] <cgack> howdy
[11:03:36] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!~
[11:04:45] <arschmitz> ok lets get started
[11:05:00] <arschmitz> page classes pr landed
[11:05:04] <arschmitz> yay
[11:05:18] <arschmitz> loader is all device tested and ready to land
[11:06:07] <arschmitz> toolbar is done another round of review and waiting on some updates
[11:06:20] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: how is listview looking
[11:06:45] <gabrielschulhof> Still working on it.
[11:06:53] <gabrielschulhof> It's close, but I think I still need to update the tests.
[11:07:03] <arschmitz> ok
[11:08:51] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: im going to land the demos updates
[11:09:01] <jasperdegroot> ok great
[11:09:03] <arschmitz> those look good
[11:09:09] <jasperdegroot> demos and css updates actually
[11:09:13] <arschmitz> and we can start addressing individual issues
[11:09:15] <arschmitz> yes
[11:09:26] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:09:35] <jasperdegroot> we can use that "various demos issues" ticket
[11:09:40] <arschmitz> yup
[11:10:00] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i hijacked https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7947
[11:10:31] <arschmitz> i rebased it with 1.5-dev which was a HUGE PITA
[11:10:50] <arschmitz> and am going to add the very limited classes related updates pagecontainer needs
[11:13:27] <arschmitz> this brought me to something somewhat interesting
[11:14:11] <arschmitz> i was trying to figure out which is faster closest( ".ui-pagecontainer" ) or  closest( $.mobile.pagecontainers )
[11:14:34] <arschmitz> its hugely browser dependant
[11:15:34] <arschmitz> http://jsperf.com/container/2
[11:16:24] <gabrielschulhof> Wow!
[11:16:55] <gabrielschulhof> Weird! A selector is faster than accessing a variable?
[11:17:12] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: the more containers there are selector is way way faster
[11:17:19] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[11:17:24] <gabrielschulhof> ... and more correct.
[11:17:35] <gabrielschulhof> After all, the list of containers is just a list.
[11:17:39] <gabrielschulhof> You really want the closest.
[11:17:47] <arschmitz> its closest either way
[11:17:57] <arschmitz> your just doing closest on a collection vs a selector
[11:18:02] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, I see.
[11:18:44] <gabrielschulhof> Well, in the case of a selector, you're traversing, and in the case of the collection, you're comparing DOM elements at each step as you go up the DOM.
[11:18:58] <gabrielschulhof> ... and comparing to a class is done natively.
[11:19:09] <arschmitz> yup
[11:19:12] <gabrielschulhof> So, that should be fast.
[11:19:38] <gabrielschulhof> ... and it makes sense semantically.
[11:19:43] <arschmitz> so what im getting at is we should pick a canonical way to do this
[11:19:51] <gabrielschulhof> Why do we even need pagecontainers?
[11:20:04] <gabrielschulhof> this.element.closest( ".ui-pagecontainer" )
[11:20:08] <gabrielschulhof> ^ my vote
[11:22:09] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah its a little slower in the common case
[11:23:13] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, but not by that much.
[11:23:19] <arschmitz> nope
[11:23:29] <gabrielschulhof> ... and we should avoid doing .closest() during _create() anyway.
[11:23:44] <arschmitz> we just need to instead of introducing pagecontainers we need to just add classes option
[11:23:47] <gabrielschulhof> We don't have too many widgets that require a page container.
[11:23:54] <arschmitz> nope its special case
[11:23:55] <gabrielschulhof> Panel, and maybe popup, I think.
[11:24:02] <arschmitz> fixed toolbar
[11:24:08] <gabrielschulhof> Right.
[11:24:19] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, after all, pagecontainer also needs a classes option.
[11:24:38] <arschmitz> yeah that will fix this
[11:26:10] <gabrielschulhof> Cool!
[11:26:39] <arschmitz> ok so ill take care of that and get this pr off your plate
[11:27:39] <arschmitz> Accordion is partially updated
[11:27:45] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Thanks!
[11:27:57] <arschmitz> apsdehal: is almost done with the bootstrap
[11:28:06] <arschmitz> he has all but the events suites passing
[11:28:24] <jasperdegroot> will collapsible and accordion live next to each other in 1.5?
[11:28:28] <arschmitz> yes
[11:28:34] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:28:44] <arschmitz> but we will remove the collapsible demos
[11:28:50] <arschmitz> since it will be deprecated
[11:28:54] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:29:13] <arschmitz> i kept them in the PR because it makes it a lot easier to work on lol
[11:29:26] <jasperdegroot> true
[11:31:04] <arschmitz> the pr to re-arrange core is landing today
[11:31:13] <arschmitz> once i finish the PR im working on right now
[11:31:51] <arschmitz> the pr's to update to current qunit api are almost all landed
[11:32:45] <arschmitz> next accessability testing
[11:33:16] <arschmitz> iv been helping the folks at Deque get a grunt plugin for doing ci testing for accessability testing based on their axe platform
[11:33:32] <arschmitz> once this is up and running we should add it to our tests on the demos
[11:34:03] <arschmitz> it will run through webdriver using browserstack
[11:34:52] <arschmitz> and the last thing i have for today is an oldie
[11:34:56] <arschmitz> RTL
[11:35:19] <arschmitz> we have had more interest in getting this supported again
[11:35:30] <arschmitz> this time from the folks in the Bidi labs at IBM
[11:35:36] <jasperdegroot> yeah, should really get priority for 1.6 i think
[11:35:55] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: doing this is just not that simple for that to be realistice
[11:36:13] <jasperdegroot> more something for 2.0?
[11:36:25] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: full support is going to be several years
[11:36:44] <gabrielschulhof> Wow! Is it that involved?
[11:36:54] <arschmitz> they will be working component by component to fully implement support in both ui and mobile
[11:36:59] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes
[11:37:14] <gabrielschulhof> Wow! Looking forward to their PRs.
[11:37:16] <arschmitz> if your not familir with Bidi it stands for bi directional
[11:37:34] <gabrielschulhof> Let's try not to make ourselves too much of a moving target for them, if it'll take years.
[11:37:36] <arschmitz> because to do this correctly its essential to support mixed direction
[11:37:40] <arschmitz> at a very granular level
[11:38:10] <arschmitz> These are the same folks that did all the work on dojo
[11:38:21] <arschmitz> and they have offered the same level of commitment for ui and mobile
[11:38:37] <jasperdegroot> nice
[11:39:09] <arschmitz> and because of their work with dojo they understand the work process for projects like ours and how much time and effort this will take
[11:39:19] <arschmitz> and are commited to providing that
[11:40:23] <arschmitz> The first step for them is going to be datepickeer since its currently being re-written and current version already supports RTL though not correctly
[11:41:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and i had a eraly call with them yesterday to discuss this and get things started
[11:43:15] <gabrielschulhof> :+1:
[11:43:33] <arschmitz> ok thats all i have for this week
[11:43:40] <arschmitz> does anyone have anything else?
[11:43:52] <jasperdegroot> i m good
[11:44:06] <gabrielschulhof> I'm good too.
[11:45:19] <arschmitz> ok
[11:45:24] <arschmitz> see everyone back on -dev
[11:45:26] <jasperdegroot> later all
