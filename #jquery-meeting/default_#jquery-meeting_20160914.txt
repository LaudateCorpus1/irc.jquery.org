[12:00:38] <jzaefferer> hello
[12:00:43] <arschmitz> hi
[12:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> The slider custom handle demo was merged
[12:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15023
[12:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1740
[12:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz sent a PR for fixing the icon color issue.
[12:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/159
[12:02:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1745
[12:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> That was also merged.
[12:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> Sortable had a regression with the `cancel()` method: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15042
[12:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a PR for that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1746
[12:03:27] <arschmitz> yeah that looks good to me since i agree a test is too much work
[12:03:36] <arschmitz> and unlikely to regress
[12:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll get that merged then.
[12:04:56] <jzaefferer> simple enough...
[12:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> Which brings us to the 1.12.1 release.
[12:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> Everything on our list from last week has been addressed.
[12:05:15] <fnagel> hey guys
[12:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything else that should happen before the release?
[12:05:39] <jzaefferer> could that change affect any other widget?
[12:05:41] <arschmitz> No but we also did have an issue with a major memory leak in classes usage in autocomplete
[12:05:44] <jzaefferer> this line specifically: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/a1d69208bad175a27c7b50c27fdc10001563cd4d#diff-d0dabf44bc2d20a778a4ad2ca3195e0cR192
[12:06:34] <jzaefferer> Is any other widget calling _mouseUp and not passing an actual event?
[12:06:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we would have to go through anything using mouse widget
[12:06:54] <jzaefferer> If no one checked that, we should do it (later)
[12:07:25] <arschmitz> i didn't look at other widgets
[12:08:06] <arschmitz> its not
[12:08:09] <arschmitz> in anything else
[12:08:14] <jzaefferer> ok, nevermind :-)
[12:08:24] <arschmitz> i just did a search _mouseUp is only in mouse, sortable, and draggable
[12:08:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I don't, but I'm just back from vacation
[12:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> I did a search for calls to `_mouseUp()` but didn't find any other bad calls.
[12:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> I am glad that we didn't have to revert Hannah's commit though :-)
[12:09:25] <jzaefferer> heh
[12:10:37] <jzaefferer> So, 1.12.1 this week?
[12:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. I can actually do it after the meeting.
[12:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything non-release related to discuss?
[12:13:56] <arschmitz> no
[12:15:16] <jzaefferer> I'm currently busily catching up on work, but I should be able to help out with the release
[12:15:26] <jzaefferer> Hopefully it goes more smoothly then the last /o\
[12:16:09] <jzaefferer> Is there something besides that I should focus on?
[12:16:23] <jzaefferer> Interactions/PEP, datepicker?
[12:16:45] <jzaefferer> Since GSoC is over, I've got more availability for UI
[12:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker or Interactions/PEP, for sure.
[12:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> Those are the two big things.
[12:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> The other big thing that's important, but not inside jquery-ui is Download Builder review/cleanup.
[12:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> I have PEP (actual PEP, not integration into UI) and DB as my two big things to focus on after the release.
[12:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> And providing whatever help fnagel needs since he's been waiting FOREVER.
[12:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker PR review is at the top of my list for after the release.
[12:21:13] <fnagel> :-D
[12:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's all for today. I'll start the release now.
[12:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks everyone.
