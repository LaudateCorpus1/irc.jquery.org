[09:16:58] <analphabet> Hey, I'd like to know the native name + the script direction of a language. How can I do that?
[11:27:35] <analphabet> I've noticed that the script direction of cldr is not yet available as json: http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/9038http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/9038
[11:27:41] <analphabet> * http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/9038
[11:29:36] <analphabet> However, the language's native display name should be available
[12:52:31] <rxaviers> analphabet, the ticket says it will be available on CLDR 29
[12:52:33] <rxaviers> as json
[12:52:59] <rxaviers> we're in CLDR 28
[15:14:17] <analphabet> rxaviers: ok. what about the language names, though?
[15:15:47] <analphabet> Currently my solution is to have translators maintain a message called lang, which contains the language's native name. I thought cldr should have a ready-made solution for this, though. Is that the case? Is it available as JSON already?
