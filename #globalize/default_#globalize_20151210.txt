[06:31:40] <rxaviers> karan, ping
[06:31:46] <karan> Hey
[06:32:36] <karan> So today i was just learning AMD and require.js
[06:33:03] <rxaviers> Ok
[06:33:14] <karan> Thats how code is modularized at Globalize right?
[06:33:37] <rxaviers> We use AMD for the source code, but the distribution files (the built files) are wrapped using UMD to support either AMD, CommonJS, or globals.
[06:33:44] <karan> Quick question, what exactly does cldr.js do?
[06:34:19] <rxaviers> Globalize uses CLDR in the JSON format. cldr.js handles traversing and locale operations.
[06:34:54] <karan> okay, that sounds good, i haven't used either AMD or CommonJS :p, but i am getting a hang of it
[06:35:07] <rxaviers> For locale operation example: https://github.com/rxaviers/cldrjs#instantiate-a-locale-and-get-it-normalized
[06:35:26] <rxaviers> For traversing examples: https://github.com/rxaviers/cldrjs#get-item-given-its-path
[06:35:40] <karan> but why is cldr a dependancy, why don't you just include it in globalize core?
[06:36:59] <rxaviers> good question, in theory is to allow other i18n libraries to reuse cldr.js and reuse the same data among the libraries.
[06:38:32] <rxaviers> Do you have any questions on regard of AMD and require.js that you have been learning?
[06:39:02] <karan> not really
[06:39:04] <rxaviers> ok
[06:39:18] <rxaviers> Have you been able to use Globalize?
[06:39:39] <karan> they look very popular, so i get everything on stackoverflow
[06:39:54] <karan> Yes i used Globalize with plain javascript
[06:40:08] <rxaviers> cool
[06:40:28] <rxaviers> Another way I like to play with Globalize myself to test bugs, or test it in general is with Node.js
[06:40:42] <rxaviers> This way: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/#getting-started
[06:40:59] <rxaviers> It's a quick way to play with it.
[06:41:27] <rxaviers> Did you have a chance to look into #556?
[06:41:30] <karan> after i get hang of AMD( which will be today, max tommrow) i will do those example as well
[06:41:42] <karan> Yeah did go through it
[06:42:46] <karan> he did get his answer right?
[06:43:07] <karan> now we have to plan how to make that section more visible, right?
[06:43:28] <rxaviers> Correct
[06:43:53] <rxaviers> The idea is clarifying that section so others don't have the same trouble :)
[06:44:25] <karan> :thumbs_up:
[06:44:37] <karan> How were you planning to do that?
[06:44:47] <karan> what did you have in mind
[06:45:48] <rxaviers> JÃ¶rn gave a suggestion
[06:45:57] <karan> Also about Getting started link, That is a quick way to load everything right
[06:47:03] <rxaviers> Please, check if the discussion clarifies the issue question for you. I'm interested how would you update it.
[06:47:33] <rxaviers> I am probably to biased and may thing the current doc is already clear.
[06:47:37] <rxaviers> too*
[06:47:48] <rxaviers> I am probably too biased and may think the current doc is already clear. *
[06:48:09] <rxaviers> Yeap, the getting started link should be the fastest way I think.
[06:48:59] <rxaviers> Still on #556, just let me know if you have any question.
[06:48:59] <karan> i guess 99% who land up on the docs page do not have a lot of time.
[06:49:08] <rxaviers> True
[06:49:12] <rxaviers> I agree
[06:49:24] <karan> if we had a full navigation of the docs that would be great
[06:49:46] <rxaviers> ok Im open for suggestions
[06:50:45] <karan> So people will be able to navigate to concerned section quickly and find what they need
[06:51:07] <rxaviers> +1
[06:52:02] <karan> But i have no clue how would we go about it :p
[06:52:08] <rxaviers> :)
[06:52:20] <rxaviers> no problem, first things first and we'll eventually get there
[06:52:27] <karan> yup
[06:53:18] <karan> specifically about #556 i guess Jorn's suggestion will work
[06:54:02] <rxaviers> Ok and you are welcome to add new suggestions
[06:54:14] <rxaviers> When do you plan to work on it?
[06:54:14] <karan> Perhaps we should just get a website just like other jQuery projects do
[06:54:33] <karan> Althoug i understand it's easier said that done :)
[06:54:41] <karan> On #556?
[06:54:53] <rxaviers> Yeap
[06:54:56] <rxaviers> Yeap 556
[06:55:25] <rxaviers> About the website, there's a plan for that  https://github.com/jquery/api.globalizejs.com/issues/1, but few time/resources to execute it given its priority.
[06:55:36] <karan> I will make those changes Today, if thats fine.
[06:55:37] <rxaviers> Help is always welcome though :)
[06:56:08] <rxaviers> Excellent,  how about we schedule a next chat on Tue same time?
[06:56:37] <karan> Yup
[06:56:58] <karan> i start working on #556
[06:57:41] <karan> one last thing, why are we using irc instead of #slack or #gitter or something
[06:58:06] <karan> is it because whole jQuery community is on irc?
[06:58:28] <karan> or does it give some advantage over others
[06:58:38] <rxaviers> Yeap and because IRC is free and open.
[06:59:13] <karan> Got it :)
[06:59:52] <rxaviers> Feel free to ping me in the meantime
[07:01:30] <rxaviers> Thanks so far and I'm looking forward to it
[07:03:45] <karan> Sure thing, i am also very excited to be working on Globalize :)
[07:04:45] <karan> So we will chat again on next Tuesday then
[07:07:37] <karan> going offline now...
