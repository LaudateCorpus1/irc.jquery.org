[07:32:53] <arthurvr> Has anyone of you been able to setup api.globalizejs.com locally? Can’t get it setup :/
[07:35:30] <arthurvr> fails at `wordpress-validate`, no error except ‘unable to connect'
[07:35:34] <arthurvr> other sites work fine
[07:36:02] <arthurvr> verbose mode logs ‘Verifying XML-RPC version…’ but doesn’t tell me what went wrong
[10:24:50] <ashg1910> @arthurvr: because it is not listed in jquery-wp-content/sites.php
[11:15:12] <arthurvr> ashg1910: I'm using the globalize branch of jquery-wp-content ;)
[12:07:36] <ashg1910> okay
[12:25:17] <ashg1910> i'm having the same problem as yours now :/
[12:37:39] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: do you have an idea? ^
