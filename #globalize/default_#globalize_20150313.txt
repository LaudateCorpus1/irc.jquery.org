[09:13:28] <arvind-k> Hi, I'm Arvind, I'd like to work on the Globalize library as a part of GSoC 2015 in the project :  Non-gregorian calendars. I have read the guide on how to begin, I have signed the CLA, I have also set up Globalize locally, downloaded cldrjs and am able to run the examples. I also read about CLDR format. Can the mentors guide me by pointing to some beginner issues to fix and further steps? Thanks a lot in advance! PS: Sorry for the long msg.
