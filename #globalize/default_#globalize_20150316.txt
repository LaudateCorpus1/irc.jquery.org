[05:24:41] <Areeb> is the #379 is fix
[05:36:12] <Areeb> rxaviers sir ithe #379 is fix or it has bug
[05:37:49] <rxaviers> Areeb, Hi
[05:38:19] <Areeb> Hello sir
[05:39:15] <Areeb> sir if i am able to fix any bug then it would be sufficient for sample code..
[05:44:51] <rxaviers> Areeb, is there anything I can do for you?
[05:46:41] <Areeb> please do tell me that the #379 is openor it is fix Sir
[05:48:00] <rxaviers> There's  a PR working on its fix: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/415
[05:48:23] <rxaviers> So, it's been addressed.
[05:51:11] <Areeb> ok sir .then i will try #406
[07:29:33] <Areeb> Sir how to work on #339
[07:43:06] <rxaviers> Areeb, more information can be found on http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table (see x and X patterns)
[08:24:25] <tniessen> rxaviers: I will apply on GSoC for issue #398. Any thoughts on that? I still have some problems with formal requirements and I seriously hope that those won't get into my way.
[08:27:46] <rxaviers> tniessen, go for it :)
[08:28:12] <rxaviers> is there anything you need from my side?
[08:29:09] <tniessen> rxaviers: Not about my application, I just heard it might be a good idea to talk about that with the mentors
[08:31:05] <tniessen> rxaviers: However, do you have access to the CLA database? I accidentally signed it with both "tniessen" and "Tobias Nie√üen" as the full name. In my opinion, I should always use "Tobias Nie√üen", so is there any chance to remove "tniessen" (tniessen@tnie.de) from the CLA database (unless you think that is a bad idea)? (No commits have been pushed using the name tniessen).
[08:31:27] <rxaviers> tniessen, thanks for letting me know
[08:31:45] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, about CLA above, do you think we should remove one or is the duplicate info ok?
[08:46:21] <tniessen> rxaviers: About #416: Out of curiosity: Why should the docs about the `options` parameter be before `value`?
[09:27:25] <tniessen> rxaviers: After fixing everything, should I just commit in my local branch, squash everything again (git rebase -i) and push so that my pull request will still consist of a single commit?
[10:37:41] <rxaviers> tniessen, In reply to you squash question. Yeap, that would be perfect.
[10:38:43] <rxaviers> tniessen, the order of options vs value follows the order they appear here: ".pluralGenerator( [options] ) ‚ûú function( value )"
[10:40:35] <tniessen> rxaviers: Oh, sure, I was still thinking about `.plural( value[, options ] )` where the order is contrary ;)
[10:41:32] <rxaviers> I see :)
[11:22:44] <tniessen> rxaviers: Just pushed a new commit to the PR, still waiting for travis. Reviews welcome :)
