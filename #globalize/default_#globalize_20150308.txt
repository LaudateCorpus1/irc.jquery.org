[14:44:08] <tniessen> I read the jQuery list of project ideas for GSoC 2015 and came across this proposed idea: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List#globalize---runtime-code-smaller-and-quicker-for-production
[14:45:07] <tniessen> I think the idea is both achievable and worth the efforts as it won't just decrease the size of required code but also the performance (no runtime compilation / interpretation of CLDR).
[14:45:40] <tniessen> Is there anyone here who knows more about the project?
