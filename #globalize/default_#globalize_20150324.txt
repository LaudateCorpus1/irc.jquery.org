[03:38:52] <jzaefferer> tniessen_: regarding currency parsing and parsing literals: The latter is probably the real challenge here. Once parsing literals is implemented, parsing currencies might be trivial
[05:06:17] <tniessen> jzaefferer: still about
[05:07:04] <tniessen> still about #353: literals will always be static, right? We basically need to match the input against an expression containing literals. No further handling of literals is necessary, right?
[06:26:11] <jzaefferer> tniessen: I have no idea, rxaviers_ is in a much better position to answer implementation details like that (one day I need to dig into Globalize enough to answer that myself...)
[06:26:36] <tniessen> jzaefferer, okay thanks
[07:17:43] <rxaviers> tniessen, about 353, correct literals will always be static
[07:18:05] <rxaviers> it's analogous to https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/date/format.js#L240-L247
[07:18:08] <rxaviers> for dates
[07:18:41] <rxaviers> Also find "literals" in http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns
[07:19:15] <rxaviers> http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Special_Pattern_Characters
[07:19:55] <rxaviers> I've added the above references to the issue description as well
[14:10:22] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, Hi! ashg1910 wants to work on https://github.com/jquery/globalizejs.com/issues/1. Do you know any bugs on jqueryui.com that could help him to get started?
[14:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> You mean jqueryui.com issues for him to work on to get used to our setup in general?
[14:46:06] <ashg1910> scott_gonzalez: I wanted to fix some bugs near this project. Just asking for some guidance
[15:04:46] <globalize-commit> [globalize] rxaviers opened issue #427: Test: Support testing a range of CLDR versions http://git.io/jJ3z
[15:09:35] <globalize-commit> [globalize] rxaviers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/jJGC
[15:09:35] <globalize-commit> globalize/master 5f2d6a1 Rafael Xavier de Souza: Bower: Update cldr-data-downloader to 0.2.x...
[15:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> ashg1910: Do you have a local setup working to deploy sites?
[15:13:37] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yes.
[15:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'd suggest just starting with some simple pages.
[15:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> Skip the nav, etc.
[15:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> Take some pages that you have content for and start moving the content over.
[15:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> That will get you used to the workflow.
[15:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> Once some of the content is there, we can start working on the more infrastructury stuff like nav.
[15:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> And of course API is mostly just writing tons of content.
[15:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> I can explain the XML that we're using when you get to that point (if that's a part that you're even interested in).
[15:17:24] <rxaviers> ashg1910, ^. Just let us know if you have any questions
[15:17:30] <rxaviers> thanks scott_gonzalez,
[15:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[15:19:50] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, about #427, thanks. Good points
[15:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> It does serve as good regerssion testing.
[15:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> Every once in a while we do something in UI that seems totally safe, but it breaks usage with old jQuery versions.
[15:23:10] <rxaviers> definitely good to know to decide when we need to update "cldr-data": ">= 25.x" =)
[15:23:37] <rxaviers> or to fix the regressions (obviously) hehe
