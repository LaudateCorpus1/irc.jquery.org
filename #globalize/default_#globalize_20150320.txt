[09:58:43] <rxaviers> Hi Souvik. So, as we've talked just let me know if you have any questions.
[10:24:12] <rxaviers> GSoC candidates: For the ones who haven't submitted yet, make sure you do ASAP. Don't wait until the last minute to submit your application. Having it sent early will help reviewing it and giving you feedback with time in advance.
[10:27:05] <tniessen> rxaviers: Working on it heavily
[10:27:13] <rxaviers> ;)
[12:54:37] <tniessen> rxaviers: I am not a native English speaker, but I am pretty sure there is a typo in the project title on github ;)
[14:10:10] <rxaviers> tniessen, which please?
[14:22:24] <tniessen> rxaviers: Shouldn't it be "
[14:22:25] <tniessen> A JavaScript library for internationalization and localization that LEVERAGES the official Unicode CLDR JSON data
[14:22:25] <tniessen> "
[14:23:07] <rxaviers> yeap, library is singular. It should be leverages
[14:23:17] <rxaviers> thanks
[14:24:15] <tniessen> rxaviers: np, just came across it when quoting it ;)
