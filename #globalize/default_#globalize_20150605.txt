[09:47:15] <apsdehal> rxaviers: ping
[09:53:26] <apsdehal> jzaefferer We need to add env vars on travis CI for globalize
[09:53:35] <apsdehal> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/globalize/builds/65530991
[10:16:59] <rxaviers> apsdehal, hi
[10:17:14] <apsdehal> hey
[10:17:50] <apsdehal> We need browserstack env variables on travis
[10:19:31] <rxaviers> jzaefferer has addressed this issue with https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/381/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3R9
[10:20:21] <rxaviers> Although, I remember having a conversation saying that this isnt secure. The keys are obfuscated, although not secure.
[10:20:28] <apsdehal> We don't need that
[10:20:43] <apsdehal> We only need to set env variables on travis
[10:20:45] <rxaviers> what do you need to get those vars in travis?
[10:20:45] <arschmitz> rxaviers: you need to log into browserstack
[10:20:46] <arschmitz> and set them
[10:20:52] <apsdehal> Rest intern will handle
[10:20:55] <arschmitz> i mean travis
[10:21:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer may have access to it
[10:21:44] <arschmitz> rxaviers: you should and so should he its any owner i think
[10:22:12] <apsdehal> Yes its any owner.
[10:22:37] <apsdehal> Login with Github on travis
[10:22:52] <apsdehal> Go to jquery/globalize
[10:22:54] <rxaviers> Im logged in and yes it seems like I can add it
[10:23:02] <apsdehal> On right side there will a button settings
[10:23:13] <rxaviers> which browser stack keys should we use?
[10:23:54] <apsdehal> https://theintern.github.io/intern/#hosted-selenium
[10:24:01] <apsdehal> You need to add according to this
[10:26:18] <rxaviers> yeap, but using our personal keys?
[10:26:35] <rxaviers> arschmitz, do you have something similar setup for Mobile?
[10:26:42] <arschmitz> no
[10:26:50] <apsdehal> Keys which have access to browserstack.
[10:26:52] <arschmitz> we dont do automated cross browser testing on mobile
[10:26:58] <arschmitz> pep does though
[10:27:21] <arschmitz> PEP is doing exactly this
[10:27:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do you use your personal browserstack keys on travis for PEP?
[10:27:48] <rxaviers> if you are the one who has set it up
[10:28:23] <arschmitz> rxaviers: i thinnk we generate a special set
[10:28:27] <arschmitz> so they could be revoked
[10:28:52] <arschmitz> there are ways with a PR to force environment variables to print out so they are not 100% secure
[10:29:02] <arschmitz> but they are good enough
[10:33:40] <rxaviers> good point
[10:45:37] <apsdehal> rxaviers: ping me back when you are done with setting variables
[10:46:17] <rxaviers> apsdehal, I want to get jzaefferer input first and ping you back. If I dont, please feel free to remind me :)
[10:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we generate tokens for each project.
[10:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> I can generate one for Globalize.
[10:54:56] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, awesome! thanks
[10:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, Globalize already has a user.
[10:55:14] <arschmitz> yeah jzaefferer did a pr
[10:55:21] <arschmitz> putting the keys base 64 encoded in the repo
[10:55:23] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[10:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:55:29] <arschmitz> they just need to be put in travis
[10:55:35] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, could you regenerate the keys and send me pvtly?
[10:55:39] <rxaviers> please
[10:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have the credentials for the existing account.
[10:56:36] <rxaviers> oh ok
[10:56:52] <rxaviers> alright, let me use that for now and I can talk with jzaefferer about regenerating them
[10:56:54] <rxaviers> thanks
[10:59:14] <rxaviers> apsdehal, can you test it?
[10:59:25] <rxaviers> the env vars have been added
[10:59:33] <apsdehal> Let me see
[11:54:05] <apsdehal> Still https://travis-ci.org/jquery/globalize/builds/65614171
[11:55:49] <apsdehal> rxaviers: ^
[12:06:13] <rxaviers> apsdehal, can you summarize it please? Did the env addition have any effect? I.e., is this a new error or the same one?
[12:40:32] <apsdehal> rxaviers: It is the same one
[12:40:46] <apsdehal> DM me when you are available
[12:43:08] <rxaviers> just did, have you received it?
