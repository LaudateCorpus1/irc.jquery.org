[06:36:38] <globalize-commit> globalize/fix-347 e8d808b Rafael Xavier de Souza: Build: Add commitplease to validate commit messages...
[06:48:23] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, arschmitz, on a new PR commit push, two actions are triggered continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr and continuous-integration/travis-ci/push
[06:48:37] <rxaviers> The continuous-integration/travis-ci/push uses a valid commit https://travis-ci.org/jquery/globalize/builds/53196918
[06:49:04] <rxaviers> The continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr does not: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/globalize/builds/53196919
[06:49:17] <rxaviers> Do you know where the `0d19dece1543905f7161054785525db051730ff9` comes from?
[06:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You're testing against GitHub's merge commit.
[06:50:51] <rxaviers> ah!
[06:51:34] <rxaviers> compare_size task fails and my new commitplease task fails as well.
[06:52:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know why compare_size cares about tips at all.
[06:52:27] <scott_gonzalez> But "Merge e8d808b into f040453" should fail based on commitplease rules.
[06:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you running commitplease against a hardcoded base and HEAD?
[06:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> Because Travis doesn't give you the right info and you don't want to make an API call for it?
[06:54:29] <rxaviers> My goal is to check all the commit messages of the branch.
[06:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> All of them?
[06:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> Not just the ones in the PR?
[06:55:19] <rxaviers> commitplease grunt task can be used locally as well.
[06:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> Seems silly to test the full branch, but if you want to do that and ignore the merge commit, just use HEAD^.
[06:56:55] <rxaviers> Ideally, all the project commit messages should be valid.
[06:57:45] <rxaviers> I had to pick a base, because there are old Globalize invalid messages.
[06:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using the merge commit?
[06:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, what do you want to happen if someone pushes a bad commit message to master.
[06:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> And then every single PR fails CI.
[06:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> For something that no contributor can ever fix?
[06:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> Becuase you're checking all history.
[06:59:28] <rxaviers> Someone in that case has commit access, so Im hoping this should not be frequent. But, in that case, I will need to update the check base.
[06:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> Seems really silly, but do what you want.
[06:59:58] <arschmitz> that seems crazy to me
[07:00:02] <arschmitz> but yeah your choice
[07:00:30] <arschmitz> also that would be far less likely to happen if you just used commitplease normally
[07:00:31] <rxaviers> Ideally I should check master..HEAD^
[07:00:48] <rxaviers> arschmitz, anyone can
[07:00:50] <arschmitz> because it would make it an intentional action to force the commit and then push it to master
[07:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: That's an incorrect range as well.
[07:02:54] <rxaviers> yeap
[07:03:04] <rxaviers> I cannot use master..HEAD^ on branches that are linear
[07:03:21] <rxaviers> Although, I always can use master..HEAD
[07:03:44] <rxaviers> the result will be empty when on master
[07:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> The PR might not be against master.
[07:04:22] <rxaviers> Why? Because, the env may not have `master` right?
[07:04:26] <arschmitz> rxaviers: there are over a dozen prs on ui and mobile right now not against master
[07:05:10] <rxaviers> My goal is: having a fail status when there are invalid commit messages
[07:05:32] <arschmitz> rxaviers: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1415 is an example
[07:05:57] <rxaviers> arschmitz, so?
[07:06:11] <arschmitz> so you cant ever assume master
[07:08:55] <rxaviers> not for that reason, I dont care if a PR has a diff base. If there are invalid commit messages (from master to the HEAD of a branch), I should get a fail status.
