[06:09:44] <globalize-commit> [globalize] rxaviers closed pull request #411: Fixed issue 393 autogenerated headerlinks (master...fix-393-headerlinks) http://git.io/xhdv
[11:53:41] <tniessen> rxaviers: I got some insight into the project, but not that much into CLDR itself. Had a look at #403, guess we need to add supplemental/ordinals.json...
[11:53:41] <tniessen>  Anyway, is it correct that I basically just have to change the data source? As far as I got it, the rule definitions are the same for ordinals and cardinals.
[11:55:34] <rxaviers> Note carindals and ordinals are part of pluralization support. We use make-plurals.js under the hoods to power it. Make-plurals supports both carindals and ordinals rules.
[11:55:43] <rxaviers> Basically, #403 needs to expose an API
[11:56:11] <rxaviers> or even better, an option for .pluralGenerator() and .plural() that modifies them to use ordinal rules.
[11:56:31] <rxaviers> Btw, more info about plural/cardinals/ordinals can be found at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Language_Plural_Rules
[11:59:17] <Matachines> So... what was the last verdict on the code output style?
[12:03:04] <tniessen> rxaviers: Yeah, I found that, took me some time to understand the rules and where to find them
[12:03:30] <rxaviers> Matachines, no verdict yet :
[12:03:35] <rxaviers>  :'(
[12:05:12] <rxaviers> tniessen, basically it's going to be providing the cardinals data for MakePlural https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/plural.js#L56-L58
[12:05:18] <rxaviers> https://github.com/eemeli/make-plural.js
[12:05:27] <tniessen> rxaviers: Yep, I found that by now, thanks
[12:05:31] <rxaviers> :D
[12:06:22] <rxaviers> tniessen, we embed it into Globalize (and optimize it by removing unused stuff https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L132-L158)
[12:07:47] <tniessen> rxaviers: Your proposal includes `Globalize.pluralGenerator( value[, options] )`. Shouldn't it be either `Globalize.pluralGenerator(options)` or `Globalize.plural(value[, options])`? I don't see how the suggested form is compatible to the current API. As far as I know, the generator does not get the value, right?
[12:08:54] <tniessen> rxaviers: However, if you intend to pass the options to the instances (either to `Globalize.plural` or an instance of `Globalize.pluralGenerator`), we will need to load both datasets in `Globalize.pluralGenerator`.
[12:09:47] <rxaviers> tniessen, you are correct
[12:10:22] <rxaviers> there's no value there
[12:10:32] <rxaviers> will update the description accordingly
[12:10:40] <tniessen> rxaviers: Okay, great, that seems like a simple solution
[12:10:52] <rxaviers> done
[12:10:58] <rxaviers> :)
[12:11:03] <rxaviers> looking forward to it
[12:11:22] <Matachines> OK I guess I'll just wait till you guys decide on something, will look for other stuff to work on.
[12:26:47] <tniessen> rxaviers: How do you guys handle invalid options? For instance, if options.type is neither undefined, ordinal nor cardinal? Should the function throw?
[12:27:27] <rxaviers> It should, we validate using https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/master/src/common/validate
[12:27:55] <rxaviers> example https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/date.js#L56-L57
[12:28:11] <tniessen> rxaviers: Ah, right, saw that earlier... Sorry
[12:28:18] <rxaviers> np
[12:28:55] <rxaviers> feel free to create a new parameter type validation https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/master/src/common/validate/parameter-type
[12:29:43] <rxaviers> ideally, the validation that verifies if option is "ordinal" || "cardinal" if present should throw a RangeError
[13:15:58] <tniessen> rxaviers: Can I ignore commitplease errors safely? Are those caused by earlier commits which had invalid commit messages?
[13:16:35] <rxaviers> Yeap, or feel free to rebase
