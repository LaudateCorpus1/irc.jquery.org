[07:36:55] <rxaviers> Matachines, thanks for your contribution. If you want to dig into other and have questions just let me know
[07:37:02] <rxaviers> others*
[07:37:47] <Matachines> Yeah I'm going to keep researching the non-gregorian support, want to apply to GSOC for that if I figure out a way to do it, but i will also look at other smaller issues for now. Thanks a lot!
[07:56:57] <Matachines> I actually might help with #369, I'll let you know as I am going to be busy for a few days. Basically we are just removing hard line breaks where we see them in the docs?
[12:29:49] <tniessen> rxaviers: Working on #403. Guess I am supposed to add tests as well, right?
[12:30:09] <rxaviers> Yeap ;)
[12:30:17] <rxaviers> and update README.md + doc/*
[12:30:21] <rxaviers> accordingly
[12:36:23] <tniessen> Okay, will do my best ;)
