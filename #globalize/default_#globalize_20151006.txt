[08:39:26] <apsdehal> rxaviers: there?
[08:39:32] <rxaviers_> yeap
[08:39:39] <rxaviers> yeap
[08:40:27] <apsdehal> Can you check the latest run of my PR on travis and see why tests are failing on ie 9 and 10
[08:41:21] <apsdehal> Rest are passing on chrome and firefox, but i don't think I would be able to debug gloablize specific stuff
[08:43:33] <rxaviers> apsdehal, sure, I'll be able to do it sometime today. Not now though
[08:43:43] <rxaviers> Will post a comment in the PR when I do it
[08:45:41] <rxaviers> But, it seems related to the runtime module
[08:46:47] <apsdehal> sure, thanks a lot
[08:46:50] <rxaviers> it's either about options (e.g., https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/currency-runtime.js#L19) happens to be different than expected
[08:47:16] <rxaviers> Or this function https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/common/runtime-key.js gives different output on these browsers.
[08:51:06] <apsdehal> Has globalize been tested before on ie9 and 10?
[09:11:53] <rxaviers> 1.0.0 has been tested in all supported browsers, including ie9 and ie10
[09:12:12] <rxaviers> 1.1.0 rc hasnt
