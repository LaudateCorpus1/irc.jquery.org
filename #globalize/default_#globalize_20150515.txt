[19:08:32] <apsdehal> Hi everyone, I have been assigned task to convert tests of globalize to intern
[20:17:28] <apsdehal> I have some questions
[20:18:23] <apsdehal> I am getting this error constantly: `Failed to load module cldr/main from ...../globalize/external/cldrjs/dist/cldr.js/main.js (parent: test/unit/core)`
[20:19:12] <apsdehal> I think it is trying to load https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/test/unit/core.js#L19
[20:19:37] <apsdehal> main but cldrjs/dist/cldr doesn't contain a file named main.js so fails
[20:19:43] <apsdehal> Any solution to this?
