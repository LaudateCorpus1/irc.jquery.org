[10:02:58] <apsdehal> rxaviers: Did you look at the issue?
[10:03:51] <rxaviers> apsdehal, yesterday I've asked you to inspect some values for the second issue. I'm waiting for your reply
[10:04:26] <apsdehal> I replied to awayrxaviers I think that is a different irc account for you.
[10:04:42] <apsdehal> So here is the issue
[10:04:43] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/test/unit/date/tokenizer.js#L687
[10:04:51] <apsdehal> The value returned is -0
[10:04:53] <apsdehal> Not 0
[10:04:59] <apsdehal> And that is why test fails
[10:09:30] <apsdehal> rxaviers: ^
[10:13:01] <rxaviers> apsdehal, ok just read my away msgs now :p. Interesting
[10:14:13] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, any suggestion how to overcome that issue? We have a qunit test that expects 0. But, return value is -0 according to apsdehal in his chrome/intern tests
[20:37:47] <arschmitz> apsdehal: are you around?
[20:39:39] <arschmitz> apsdehal: can you check the type of that output when you get a sec is it a string or a number? im assuming its a string looking at whats going on there but want to make sure.
[22:16:36] <apsdehal> arschmitz: ping, I am here now
[22:16:40] <apsdehal> Let me check
[22:24:10] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Number
