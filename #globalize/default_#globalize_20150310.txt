[10:29:26] <Matachines> In case anyone is here: Working on #313, pretty sure I am done with the stuff in the api folder (aside from the questions i have on the issue on gh). Working on the readme. Basically I should replace  all instances of  " âž¡  output" with " // output " right? Or are those OK to leave as is?
[13:20:02] <tniessen> Good evening rxaviers
[13:20:11] <rxaviers> Hello
[13:20:33] <tniessen> I tried some things with globalize today and discovered some really neat (and unexpected, to be honest) features
[13:21:39] <rxaviers> do you want to share them?
[13:24:03] <tniessen> I was actually surprised how easy it is to format messages (e.g. the "like" message in the hello world example). Really cool!
[13:25:31] <rxaviers> tniessen, awesome :D
[13:25:36] <tniessen> I read #397, listened to the referenced talk and read your SO answer about performance tests. I might try to work on that issue, however, I don't fully understand how those workloads should be covered in the tests.
[13:27:27] <rxaviers> No worries. We can better define those during the work.
[13:27:56] <tniessen> Oh, I just wanted to contribute something before GSoC. Perhaps I should go with something simpler.
[13:28:04] <rxaviers> absolutely
[13:28:06] <Matachines> I have a question about the non-Gregorian calendar project. Maybe it will make more sense when I spend more time with the code but in 0.x all the info is under a /lib/cultures file and I am guessing the rest of the code reads that info to use it.  There is no lib folder in the current versionâ€”would that be something to add?
[13:28:14] <rxaviers> #397 is something for GSoC
[13:28:21] <rxaviers> Pick something simpler :D
[13:28:25] <rxaviers> (for now)
[13:29:34] <rxaviers> Matachines, on 1.x one of the biggest accomplishments was in fact getting rid of /lib/cultures and using CLDR instead.
[13:30:02] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/doc/cldr.md
[13:30:06] <Matachines> OK thanks, so I will research that instead. Btw I am about to make my pull request, just making sure I did not miss anything.
[13:30:11] <tniessen> Ah right, completely forgot about the list after picking some interesting ideas, sorry :D
[13:31:10] <rxaviers> Matachines, ok. By the way, dont worry if your PR is not perfect. It can be improved after it has been created incrementally.
[13:31:13] <rxaviers> tniessen, np
[13:33:49] <tniessen> rxaviers: Do you have any suggestions for a minor contribution? I had a look at most of the issues at github and most seem non-trivial. I do want to invest some time in getting into the stuff, but I was looking for a micro project which I could complete within a few hours or a few days.
[13:35:08] <globalize-commit> [globalize] matachines opened pull request #412: 313: Code Output Placement (master...313-code-output-placement) http://git.io/puII
[13:35:14] <Matachines> That's me
[13:35:40] <rxaviers> :)
[13:36:56] <rxaviers> will review soon
[13:40:38] <Matachines> OK so in the CLDR thing, I see an example of loading the data $.get( "cldr/main/en/ca-gregorian.json" ), so basically we want to be able to do that but say ca-hebrew.json
[13:40:51] <Matachines> (for example)
[13:41:11] <rxaviers> yeap, formatting non-gregorian dates will require that
[13:41:40] <rxaviers> tniessen, doc issues are the quickest for example #273. Some specific to tests are #359 and #360. Some more holistic is #406
[13:42:06] <Matachines> Ok cool, well since 0.x handled some im going to see how that did it
[13:42:07] <rxaviers> #403 is quick too
[13:42:54] <rxaviers> Matachines, ok
[13:46:26] <rxaviers> tniessen, just let me know on any questions
[14:11:02] <tniessen> rxaviers: Thanks! I got some insight into the project, but not that much into CLDR itself. Had a look at #403, guess we need to add supplemental/ordinals.json...
[14:12:00] <tniessen> Anyway, is it correct that I basically just have to change the data source? As far as I got it, the rule definitions are the same for ordinals and cardinals.
[15:15:55] <tniessen> xraviers: I will leave for today, it is late in Germany. I will check the log tomorrow so feel free to answer later if you want to :)
