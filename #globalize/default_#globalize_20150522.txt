[11:32:03] <apsdehal> arschmitz: ping
[11:32:18] <arschmitz> apsdehal: Pong!
[11:32:35] <apsdehal> You said you have an insight on the test
[11:34:31] <arschmitz> yes
[11:34:48] <arschmitz> so in javascript 0 === -0 ALWAYS
[11:34:49] <arschmitz> or should
[11:34:55] <arschmitz> chia apparently ignores this
[11:35:06] <arschmitz> contrary to the spec
[11:35:19] <arschmitz> thats why it passed in quint but is failing now
[11:35:28] <apsdehal> Hmm, that may be the isuse
[11:35:31] <apsdehal> *issue
[11:35:51] <arschmitz> however
[11:36:05] <arschmitz> that test is doing an object comparison
[11:36:09] <apsdehal> I think we can change the expected value to -0
[11:36:15] <arschmitz> so can you get the diff for the whole object
[11:36:31] <arschmitz> id like to know why your getting -0 in the first place
[11:36:37] <arschmitz> that seems wrong
[11:37:00] <apsdehal> Then I need to get in the internals of globalize
[11:37:18] <arschmitz> can you for now just gist the dif your getting from the test
[11:37:46] <apsdehal> That reporter is not that much verbose
[11:38:07] <apsdehal> I just console logged the object and had a look at the objects
[11:38:30] <arschmitz> hm ok
[11:38:47] <arschmitz> snover seemed to think you should have a diff
[11:39:33] <apsdehal> Yes, it returns a good diff in client but not in runner
[11:40:01] <arschmitz> do you not get the error in the client?
[11:40:13] <apsdehal> I didnot try in client
[11:40:18] <apsdehal> Let me check
[11:40:40] <apsdehal> Client runs on node js environment
[11:40:54] <apsdehal> So there are require js issues
[11:42:49] <arschmitz> looks like you have not set up the client properly in your branch
[11:42:53] <arschmitz> its missing the config
[11:47:05] <apsdehal> There isn't any different for intern client
[11:47:16] <apsdehal> *different config
[11:47:33] <apsdehal> You just need to change runnerType option in grunt file to change runner type
[11:47:46] <apsdehal> And the configs are specified there itself in the gruntfile
[11:56:20] <arschmitz> apsdehal: i think all your paths are wrong in your intern.js
[11:56:27] <arschmitz> they should not have the ../
[11:56:47] <apsdehal> Works in runner, You tested it yourself
[11:57:00] <apsdehal> Maybe they are wrong for client
[11:57:00] <arschmitz> sorry its not just that hold on ill fix it and gist for you
[12:01:01] <apsdehal> What else is wrong?
[12:08:04] <arschmitz> hold on takes a min to fix
[12:20:01] <arschmitz> apsdehal: just takes a minute to properly configure everything
[12:20:17] <apsdehal> ::(
[12:21:52] <arschmitz> apsdehal: where do you define the interface?
[12:22:09] <apsdehal> gruntfile
[12:22:27] <arschmitz> carefull of mixed spaces and tabs
[12:23:52] <arschmitz> i dont see anything in there about it
[12:24:12] <apsdehal> Just a sec
[12:25:11] <apsdehal> https://github.com/apsdehal/globalize/blob/intern/Gruntfile.js#L66
[12:26:23] <arschmitz> no the interface
[12:26:30] <arschmitz> that it needs to use the qunit interface
[12:26:47] <apsdehal> You just require it via intern!qunit
[12:26:54] <apsdehal> Let me give you source code for it
[12:27:22] <apsdehal> https://github.com/apsdehal/intern/blob/qunit/lib/interfaces/qunit.js
[12:27:42] <arschmitz> no the problem is the path is wrong
[12:27:50] <arschmitz> but i dont know where its getting the path from
[12:29:36] <apsdehal> https://github.com/apsdehal/globalize/blob/intern/test/intern.js#L17
[12:30:27] <arschmitz> right execpt its not there
[12:31:08] <apsdehal> I am not getting what exactly you mean?
[12:31:22] <arschmitz> your telling me your defining the path to the qunit interface there
[12:31:29] <apsdehal> No
[12:31:30] <arschmitz> but there is no path there for the qunit interface
[12:31:41] <apsdehal> Intern autoloads its interfaces
[12:31:51] <apsdehal> There is no path to them
[12:31:59] <apsdehal> You just require them by intern!qunit
[12:32:00] <arschmitz> well its loading that one wrong then
[12:32:21] <apsdehal> Its at the same place where others libs are
[12:32:29] <arschmitz> its looking for /node_modules/intern/lib/interfaces/qunit/main.js
[12:32:48] <apsdehal> You are running in client?
[12:33:19] <arschmitz> yes
[12:33:51] <apsdehal> Well, that is weird. It should require /node_modules/intern/lib/interfaces/qunit.js
[12:34:15] <apsdehal> Maybe issue is due to requirejs
[12:34:29] <arschmitz> well the client works fine in other projects
[12:34:32] <arschmitz> we use it on pep
[12:34:44] <apsdehal> I haven't seen any example using requirejs
[12:36:02] <apsdehal> If set to default intern uses dojo's amd loader
[12:36:37] <apsdehal> Anyways if it is not able to look for qunit
[12:36:53] <apsdehal> Then you need to specifically set main param
[12:36:58] <apsdehal> in the loader
[12:37:16] <apsdehal> But config for requirejs is a little different
[12:43:11] <arschmitz> this might take a while lol
[12:43:16] <arschmitz> but i got it working
[12:47:08] <apsdehal> Give me the gist
[12:47:18] <apsdehal> I will merge it tomorrow morning
[13:05:22] <arschmitz> apsdehal: you still there?
