[09:06:46] <tniessen> I read the jQuery list of project ideas for GSoC 2015 and came across this proposed idea: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List#globalize---runtime-code-smaller-and-quicker-for-production
[09:07:17] <tniessen> I think the idea is both achievable and worth the efforts as it won't just decrease the size of required code but also the performance (no runtime compilation / interpretation of CLDR).
[09:07:25] <tniessen> Is there anyone here who knows more about the project?
[09:59:21] <phiju123> hi, my name is phiju basumatary. Im pursuing my bachelor degree in computer engineering from nit surat, India. I have good knowledge in javascript,jquery, html, css. I m interested in gsoc n also interested in Non-gorgorian calendar. I want to help and also want to learn something new. Can u suggest how to begin with?
[11:50:41] <rxaviers> tniessen, Just saw your message
[11:50:46] <rxaviers> How can I help?
[11:51:22] <phiju123> how to begin with?
[11:51:38] <phiju123> means from where i start?
[11:51:59] <rxaviers> phiju123, Hi, just saw your message as well. Thanks for your interest. You could start with https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[11:52:36] <rxaviers> In summary, begin to contribute with any open issues (https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/)
[11:53:27] <phiju123> okhie
[11:53:36] <phiju123> how to have the proposal?
[11:54:08] <phiju123> i in this site i need to solve the issues related to it
[11:58:53] <rxaviers> phiju123, I didnt fully understand your question. But, the idea of getting started is to familiarize yourself with contributing to Globalize by submitting a PR for any open issue (related or not with the GSoC one you are interested on)
[12:04:34] <tniessen> rxaviers: I don't have a lot of insight into globalize yet
[12:06:17] <tniessen> However, I am quite experienced with JS and I even got some experience with compiler development (especially java, to be honest)
[12:07:24] <rxaviers> If you've never used Globalize before, try first getting used to it. https://github.com/jquery/globalize/#getting-started may be of help.
[12:07:53] <rxaviers> There are Hello World examples too.
[12:08:00] <rxaviers> Just let me know in any questions
[12:08:32] <rxaviers> After that, I suggest going through the list of open issues and finding one you find yourself motivated to dig into.
[12:09:11] <rxaviers> Im here to help
[12:10:54] <tniessen> rxaviers: Sure, I will try to get into it as soon as possible. However, I want to ensure I got the basic idea right. So the concept is to add a feature that allows us to generate a runtime library which is precompiled from CLDR?
[12:12:50] <rxaviers> Your understanding of https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/398 is very precise.
[12:14:52] <tniessen> rxaviers: I just don't want to get it wrong, English is not my native language ;)
[12:17:16] <rxaviers> sure, but you got it correctly. If you're familiar with handlebars (a templating engine), you may notice we're pursing something very analogous to its runtime libs.
[12:17:56] <rxaviers> Compiling a template is heavy  (it uses CPU ticks and bandwitdh). Compiled templates are faster, because it has been already processed and gets smaller.
[12:18:49] <rxaviers> The large compiler code is also not necessary anymore. So, less code needs to be sent to client-side.
[12:19:10] <tniessen> rxaviers: Not just less code, even faster code (as you mentioned before)
[12:19:18] <rxaviers> exactly
[12:19:27] <rxaviers> On Globalize, the "template" is (kind of) CLDR
[12:19:58] <rxaviers> The compiler is (kind of) the setup step of formatters/parsers.
[12:21:23] <rxaviers> The pre-compiled runtime formatters and parsers will allow a very performant Globalize.
[12:21:38] <rxaviers> This is a very important feature we want to add.
[12:31:03] <tniessen> xravers: I will definitely try to get into the stuff and perhaps even try to apply for that.
[12:31:20] <tniessen> xraviers*
[12:44:02] <tniessen> rxaviers: The best example I know (in JS) is jade (which I personally love)
[12:47:27] <rxaviers> tniessen, awesome, I'm looking forward to it. Yeap, analogous to jade as well. :D
[12:47:49] <rxaviers> tniessen, just let me know on any questions
[13:06:27] <siddhism> hello, i am applying for GSoC 2015. i want to work on this idea and contribute to globalize.
[13:06:52] <siddhism> how do i setup the environment. please point me in the right direction. thanks
[13:13:05] <tniessen> xraviers: are you about utc-3? just for future contact
[13:42:27] <tniessen> rxaviers*, sorry
[13:43:04] <rxaviers> Hi siddhism, which environment do you want to setup?
[13:43:36] <siddhism> how do i start contribution
[13:43:45] <rxaviers> tniessen, I'm at BRT (GMT-3)
[13:44:18] <rxaviers> siddhism, If you've never used Globalize before, try first getting used to it. https://github.com/jquery/globalize/#getting-started may be of help.
[13:44:22] <rxaviers> There are Hello World examples too.

[13:44:40] <siddhism> ok
[13:44:41] <siddhism> thanks
[13:44:44] <rxaviers> Also make sure you read http://contribute.jquery.org/

[13:44:47] <rxaviers> ywc
[13:53:23] <Matachines> Hi guys, I am here from GSOC and interested in contributing. Going to work on issue #313 (code output placement) after I read the contribute/style guides and all that stuff!
[14:05:52] <tniessen> rxaviers: Okay, so you are four hours behind me, I will try to find you online. Thank you for your support!
[14:07:42] <rxaviers> Matachines, alright. On the #313 ticket, please assign yourself to it to avoid conflict.
[14:07:51] <rxaviers> tniessen, ywc.
[14:08:07] <Matachines> OK, will do in a bit. Do I just comment on it saying I'll do it?
[14:08:32] <rxaviers> Matachines, oh I guess you can't .
[14:08:37] <rxaviers> sorry about that
[14:08:42] <rxaviers> what's your gh username?
[14:08:58] <Matachines> matachines
[14:09:48] <rxaviers> alright, I can't assign you either. So, nevermind. Go ahead. If someone asks me I know you're on this one.
[14:09:59] <rxaviers> and thanks so far
[14:10:16] <rxaviers> Feel free to reach if you have any questions
[14:10:52] <Matachines> I just wanted to know if you guys decided on placing the output on top of the command or something else (I prefer on the top myself).
[14:13:52] <arschmitz> rxaviers: only team members can be assigned but like Matachines suggested i think its a good idea to add a comment that someone is working on it.
[14:15:35] <rxaviers> Matachines, yeap, the idea is this order of preference: 1st) aside, 2nd) on the top if too big.
[14:15:54] <rxaviers> arschmitz, yeap I have realized that. =)
[14:15:58] <Matachines> OK  awesome, thanks. I'll start working on it tonight.
[14:16:07] <rxaviers> Thanks
[14:16:30] <rxaviers> Matachines, like you suggested and arschmitz +1'ed feel free to add a comment saying you're on it please
[14:17:41] <Matachines> OK done!
[15:38:05] <Matachines> Btw, when you mean "too big" does that mean longer than 80 characters?
