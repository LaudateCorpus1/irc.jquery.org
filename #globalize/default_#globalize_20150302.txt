[12:01:49] <bobvann> Hi. I would like some info about gsoc project for non-gregorian calendars
[12:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> bobvann: You'll need to get details from rxaviers, but he just had a baby, so he may be slow to respond.
[12:05:13] <bobvann> Ok thanks :)
[12:21:31] <rxaviers> bobvann, Hi, just let me know how I can help you
[12:21:51] <rxaviers> thanks scott_gonzalez
[12:34:18] <bobvann> Hi. Congratulations for the baby :). I would like to know what exactly needs to be done
[12:37:12] <rxaviers> Thanks :)
[12:37:54] <rxaviers> I assume you have seen https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/320
[12:38:08] <bobvann> yes sure
[12:40:26] <rxaviers> Ok, calendars are used in date formatter/parser.
[12:42:15] * rxaviers is elaborating...
[12:52:01] <bobvann> and the aim would be to format dates with other calendars?
[12:52:15] <rxaviers> Absolutely...
[12:52:18] <rxaviers> Different territories use different calendar systems.
[12:52:55] <rxaviers> The goal allowing other calendars is to apply calendrical calculations on date for the given calendar and time zone to produce weekday, era, year, month, day, hour, minute, second.
[12:53:59] <bobvann> convert dates?
[12:54:37] <rxaviers> Yes, it's about converting dates and dealing with a couple of nuances. For example, on gregorian calendar there are AC and DC eras.
[12:54:58] <bobvann> Yes I understood well I think
[12:55:08] <rxaviers> On japonese calendar, there are several eras, which are related to imperial periods.
[12:56:33] <rxaviers> We have a couple of references for helping us out: (a) previous Globalize implementation for other calendars, (b) other projects that implementation diff calendars, (c) CLDR specs.
[12:56:54] <bobvann> Yes, it's much about how other calendars work I guess
[13:00:45] <rxaviers> The formatter should be able to transform `new Date(...)` into the corresponding date of calendar x.
[13:00:51] <rxaviers> the parser, do the inverse.
[13:01:45] <bobvann> So it's most adding features to the library
[13:04:49] <rxaviers> yes, it's about extending our current formatter and parser
[13:07:44] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/src/date.js
[13:08:11] <bobvann> Yes I think I'd like to partecipate to the project
[13:09:16] <rxaviers> awesome
[13:09:33] <rxaviers> I'd be happy to reply to any additional questions or have a chat
[13:09:55] <bobvann> Thank you very much for your help
[13:10:06] <rxaviers> ywc
[13:14:39] <bobvann> technical question: in JS... why to use var myF = function(...){... } instead of function myF(....){...}
[13:15:51] <bobvann> I've seen it in globalize/.../date.js
[13:19:00] <arschmitz> bobvann: the first assigns that function to a varible the second just makes a function with that name
[13:20:54] <bobvann> but when i use the function, isn't it the same?
[13:27:02] <arschmitz> bobvann: no because if you need to be able to use it as a variable you need the first, if all you care about is calling it the second is ok.
[13:28:56] <arschmitz> bobvann: they are vary similar
[13:30:44] <bobvann> ok thank you... I will read documentation :)
[13:31:02] <bobvann> To understand better the difference
[13:32:06] <arschmitz> bobvann: thats just JS not specific to globalize
[13:41:50] <bobvann> yes yes obviously :)
