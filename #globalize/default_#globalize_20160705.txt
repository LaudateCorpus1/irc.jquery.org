[16:15:35] <MrWiggly> i don't understand how the 'plain' javascript example works. In the docs it says you are supposed to load the cldr data (consisting of a bunch of .json files). But nowhere in the actual example are the .json files (from what I can tell). What am I missing?
[16:16:18] <MrWiggly> shit, forget it
[16:16:33] <MrWiggly> just found where it's statically allocated in index.html
[16:16:34] <MrWiggly> sry
[16:32:30] <MrWiggly> is anyone in here?
