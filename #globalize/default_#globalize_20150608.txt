[05:46:58] <abhay> Hi, I'm a student developer interested in getting some open source experience and I was wondering if anyone could suggest some bugs that are suitable for a beginner in this project?
[10:20:23] <bforbes> if a user's locale is en-GB, do I need to load cldr data for en-GB and en?
[14:35:36] <bforbes> also, what is the root directory for?
