[05:44:43] <rxaviers> tniessen, some tests are failing. Feel free to give it a try and help me fix them :)
[05:44:43] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/update-messageformat
[05:50:38] <tniessen> rxaviers: I gave it a try yesterday, will switch to your branch :)
[05:53:31] <rxaviers> ;)
[06:03:17] <tniessen> rxaviers: I used "git clone ... && bower install && npm install && grunt" and ended up with the same errors as yesterday (12 failed assertions).
[06:03:32] <tniessen> However, running the functional tests in the browser (grunt connect:keepalive) yields completely different results (1 failed assertion).
[06:03:49] <rxaviers> yeap weird
[06:04:07] <rxaviers> I couldn't dig into it yet.
[06:04:11] <rxaviers> why same as yesterday?
[06:04:42] <tniessen> I tried to fix the issue yesterday and came across similar assertion failures when using the latest version of messageformat.
[06:04:51] <tniessen> Cannot recall whether they were equal ;)
[06:04:51] <rxaviers> note that using messageformat-3.0 needs significant changes in the build (included in the update-messageformat branch, which I pushed today)
[06:05:02] <rxaviers> gotcha
[06:05:55] <tniessen> I saw those, nevertheless, my build came to similar problems at some point. Still strange to see the difference between browser and node. Did you try anything before 0.12.2?
[06:29:12] <tniessen> Checked that, same with 0.10.37
[06:47:26] <tniessen> Using messageformat 0.3 without fixing the build process obviously fails as well, however, *less* assertions fail. Guess this is mostly about the build process. Might have been clear to you, just as a reminder for myself ;)
[08:10:25] <rxaviers> tniessen, just reading your msgs now. Basically, most of the build changes were due to messageformat 0.3 be wrapping its code using browserify.
