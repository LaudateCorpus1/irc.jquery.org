[05:21:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hi! For some reason the CLA checker didnt add a label for https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/410
[05:21:39] <rxaviers> I've checked manually he's good.

[05:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...the process is still running on the server.
[05:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see what GitHub says.
[05:25:45] <rxaviers> tks
[05:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub says the hook was successfully delivered.
[05:26:26] <rxaviers> interesting

[05:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Those `#012`s are strange.
[05:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> Not a whole lot of useful data there without long stack traces :-/
[05:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> All we can see if that a request to GitHub failed.
[05:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing it was one of the earliest ones, like setting the pending status or something like that.
[05:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> Since we didn't even get that far in the process.
[05:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try manually running the validation on that PR and see if it fails again.
[05:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that worked.

[05:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing on status.github.com in the past 24 hours.
[05:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> Very intersting indeed.
[05:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see if I can get more data in the GitHub API request errors in case this happens again.
[05:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for letting me know.
[05:35:29] <rxaviers> Thanks for checking
[05:35:38] <rxaviers> By the way, a subsequent PR worked just fine https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/411
[05:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, the #012 is character escaping for new line + tab.
[05:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think this was just a hiccup in the GitHub API.
[05:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> When they say everything is 100%, they mean a very low error rate ;-)
[05:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> EXCEPTION PERCENTAGE: 0.0002%
[05:38:34] <scott_gonzalez> We were one of those lucky few :-)
[05:48:55] <rxaviers> Ah!
[05:49:03] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is there a way for me to manually re-run the checker?
[05:49:16] <rxaviers> trigger it, actually
[05:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> No triggers yet, you have to SSH to the server and run the script.
[05:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you *can* run it locally, but then your user will add the labels and set the status instead of jquerybot.
[05:59:30] <rxaviers> Ah ok thanks. I will wait for another commit from him then :D
[06:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> I can trigger a recheck if you'd like. I'm still logged in from checking what went wrong with the other PR.
[06:09:58] <rxaviers> no worries
[06:09:58] <rxaviers> thanks
[06:10:20] <rxaviers> I expect new review fixes from him anyway
