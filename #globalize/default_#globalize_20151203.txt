[09:33:48] <ankk> hi.
[09:34:09] <ankk> does globalize support Turkish for date and number validation?
[09:34:58] <ankk> apsdehal1, ankk, bforbes, gnarf, jqlog, kborchers
[09:35:00] <ankk> are you here?
[10:13:05] <ankk> rxaviers come back
[11:26:57] <ankk> rxaviers, i need you
[11:27:32] <ankk> i downloaded core.zip from cldr website and unzip it
[11:27:47] <ankk> but its folder structure seems a bit different from globalize
[11:27:54] <rxaviers> ankk, hey
[11:28:02] <ankk> and i don't really get how i should use cldr data on globalize
[11:28:08] <ankk> rxaviers, hi
[11:28:28] <rxaviers> ankk, are you using Globalize on client-side or server-side (e.g., node.js)?
[11:28:37] <ankk> client-side
[11:28:48] <ankk> i will use it on mvc web application
[11:29:07] <rxaviers> do you use any module format like AMD, CommonJS?
[11:29:11] <rxaviers> do you use any module format like AMD, CommonJS, ES6?
[11:29:16] <ankk> nope
[11:30:10] <rxaviers> ok, and I assume you don't use any build tools to build your client-side for deployment. Right?
[11:30:39] <ankk> yes
[11:30:54] <rxaviers> Have you looked into this examples below?
[11:30:55] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/master/examples/plain-javascript
[11:31:05] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/doc/cldr.md
[11:32:42] <ankk> i read them before but i can't find any json file on cldr side
[11:33:22] <ankk> for example you are saying "cldr/main/en/ca-gregorian.json"  in here ( https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/master/doc/cldr.md )
[11:33:42] <ankk> but there isn't en subdir in main dir
[11:34:18] <ankk> i don't see the same things on your documents and on cldr archive
[11:38:30] <ankk> hmmmmmmm
[11:39:48] <rxaviers> ankk, will read your messages in 20-30mins, sorry about it.
[11:48:29] <rxaviers> ankk, I'm back
[11:48:42] <ankk> rxaviers, welcome back
[11:48:50] <ankk> i found json files :)
[11:49:03] <rxaviers> ah! Cool
[11:49:09] <ankk> and i started to copy json files for just my language. it is enough, right?
[11:49:42] <rxaviers> Please, find the CLDR JSON requirement here https://github.com/jquery/globalize/#2-cldr-content
[11:49:48] <rxaviers> It depends on which modules you're using
[11:50:27] <ankk> hm
[11:50:42] <rxaviers> Alternatively to worrying about CLDR data, you could try Globalize compiler
[11:50:58] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/master/examples/globalize-compiler
[11:51:57] <rxaviers> Just let me know if you have any questions
[11:53:13] <ankk> after i check all of them, i'll be here
[11:53:16] <ankk> thank you so much
[11:53:33] <rxaviers> ywc
[12:00:44] <rxaviers> ankk, fixing my typo above: "to NOT* worry about..."
[12:01:13] <rxaviers> oh nevermind, it was right, "Use globalize compiler and don't worry with loading CLDR data yourself"
[12:01:37] <rxaviers> yloubry, Hi Johann
[12:02:38] <ankk> rxaviers, :) if i will be able to run this on my application, i will record my first video on youtube. and tell the details but in my own language.
[12:02:53] <rxaviers> whops, Yohann*
[12:02:56] <ankk> i think there isn't any "very clear" walkthrough about this
[12:02:58] <jzaefferer> hello
[12:03:03] <yloubry> Hello
[12:03:20] <yloubry> First time on IRC so bear with me ;)
[12:03:31] <rxaviers> ankk, that would be awesome. Please, keep me posted.
[12:03:38] <rxaviers> yloubry, welcome
[12:03:41] <ankk> wow. 15 years on irc..
[12:04:04] <rxaviers> We also have jzaefferer (JÃ¶rn) from the team that is participating of this chat.
[12:04:29] <rxaviers> Nova Patch replied me on Twitter saying he's joining
[12:04:31] <yloubry> Cool. Hello everyone
[12:04:37] <rxaviers> So, let's give some more minutes and we start
[12:05:48] <rxaviers> novapatch, Hi!
[12:05:58] <novapatch> howdy!
[12:06:14] <rxaviers> Thanks for joining novapatch, yloubry and jzaefferer
[12:06:22] <rxaviers> yloubry (Yohann) is from Adobe
[12:06:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer (JÃ¶rn) is from jQuery too
[12:06:59] <rxaviers> novapatch (Nova) is from Shuttlestock
[12:07:32] <rxaviers> feel free to intro yourselves :)
[12:07:49] <novapatch> Shutterstock, that is :)
[12:08:16] <jzaefferer> I was just wondering about that, I wasn't familar with Shuttlestock :-)
[12:08:29] <jzaefferer> Maybe keeping a stock of space shuttles for rent? That would be cool
[12:08:32] <yloubry> Sure, Yohann Loubry. Internationalization Engineer at Adobe. Work on the Digital Media products so anything you guys use or will use with your creative cloud account
[12:08:55] <rxaviers> :)
[12:09:05] <rxaviers> Sorry for the typos, I got Yohann name wrong and now Nova's company
[12:09:06] <rxaviers> ouch
[12:09:34] <rxaviers> Today, I'd like to get the ball rolling basically.
[12:09:51] <rxaviers> I've met Nova and Yohann on Santa Clara and we've talked about using Globalize.
[12:10:04] <jzaefferer> I'm JÃ¶rn Zaefferer. Freelance software engineer and consultant from Germany. Have been involved in moving Globalize to CLDR (I got Rafael to work on that) and have been involved on the sidelines since then.
[12:10:22] <rxaviers> I want to make sure there's nothing blocking you.
[12:10:47] <rxaviers> Yeap, before JÃ¶rn gave me the challenge of fixing this in Globalize, I knew very little about i18n/CLDR/etc.
[12:10:56] <jzaefferer> I'm happy to see more people and companies adopting Globalize. We're always hopeful to gain contributors as well, since our time spent on Globalize is limited.
[12:12:21] <Yohann> I think globalize is a great library and definitely one that has a lot of features.
[12:13:16] <Yohann> For us at Adobe, when a new product or service is being built, we see a trend that javascript is used in both front and back-end
[12:14:29] <rxaviers> That's good to know and it's a tren I've been seen in other companies too.
[12:14:32] <novapatch> some background for me: I helped one of our Node teams select Globalize, and although I don't actively use Node myself and I personally focus on international search, I'm overseeing the i18n-related features of other teams
[12:14:34] <rxaviers> trend*
[12:15:31] <Yohann> For server side utilizing the v8 engine, we have relied on the Intl Ecma initiative for our i18n formatting but sometimes there is a gap as it doesn't not yet support templating
[12:16:15] <jzaefferer> ECMA 402 also lacks any kind of parsing
[12:16:52] <rxaviers> EMCA currently lacks this: http://rxaviers.github.io/globalize-modern-apps/#/0/17
[12:16:54] <rxaviers> :)
[12:16:58] <Yohann> I think the good thing about libraries such as Globalize is that it can be implemented on mobile browsers as well. Our dev are asking for ways to minimize the footprint of these libraries
[12:17:00] <jzaefferer> And from what I've seeen in the standards groups, its not going to change
[12:17:16] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that's a nice summary
[12:17:33] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: though it doesn't even mention parsing
[12:18:01] <rxaviers> Thanks for the backgrounds and for the insights
[12:18:04] <rxaviers> (yeap)
[12:18:08] <jzaefferer> Yohann: the work Rafael has put into the runtime and compiler make this very attractive. Especially with the webpack plugin its really great
[12:18:27] <cahuja> Yes, I second that.
[12:18:52] <rxaviers> cahuja, Chetan?
[12:18:58] <cahuja> Yes
[12:19:10] <rxaviers> Thanks for joining too
[12:19:52] <cahuja> Showing the capabilities of webpack + globalize significantly helped with all the hesitancy regarding the size of the CLDR download.
[12:20:04] <Yohann> I have been at Adobe for about 1 year and the project that I got to work from scratch needed implementation completed by fall.  With webpack and react used for this project, I wasn't able to select globalize as our choice of i18n library
[12:20:14] <rxaviers> cahuja, in case you missed the intros, we have novapatch (Nova - Shutterstock) and Yohann (Adobe)
[12:20:26] <rxaviers> cahuja is from TripAdvisor
[12:20:50] <rxaviers> cahuja, feel free to intro you and give you background
[12:21:27] <Yohann> I m sure that I'll consider it for the other projects. I was reluctant to make the change with our core team to use it as they had already worked with ReactJS from the guys at Yahoo
[12:21:28] <rxaviers> To keep the chat laser focused, after cahuja is done, the first question I'd like to ask you guys individually is if there's anything on Globalize blocking any work you are doing using it.
[12:21:38] <cahuja> Hi everyone, I am Chetan Ahuja, and I work as a software engineer at TripAdvisor working on internationalization and new markets.
[12:21:45] <Yohann> But I think Globalize is very agnostic of the technology and can adapt to many other framework
[12:22:04] <rxaviers> ;)
[12:22:20] <rxaviers> (btw, I had the chance to show Yohann the webpack and react-globalize integration during IUC)
[12:22:24] <Yohann> Which makes it easier for us to teach, document and give example to our partners to use this one rather than others
[12:22:49] <rxaviers> thanks for the intro cahuja
[12:22:55] <rxaviers> Anyone feel free to interrupt me anytime.
[12:23:13] <rxaviers> About any blockers, cahuja, Yohann, novapatch, do you have anything?
[12:23:37] <rxaviers> For novapatch, I know there's https://github.com/rxaviers/cldrjs/issues/29, which I may work still this year.
[12:25:09] <Yohann> I don't have any blocker on my side.
[12:25:57] <cahuja> No blockers related to globalize at the moment for me. I had a few before webpack (so, thanks for that)
[12:26:06] <Yohann> As far as the react-globalize. Since react is still actively being developed. Do you guys know how it will be maintained?
[12:26:42] <rxaviers> cahuja, good to know, ywc
[12:26:44] <cahuja> Is there any interest in a dust-globalize integration? (This is not a blocker, but will be needed in the future)
[12:26:46] <rxaviers> Yohann, anything in specific?
[12:27:19] <novapatch> I'm chatting with the team, but I hear that their usege is going well (other than infra saying the cldr data is taking lots of space!)
[12:27:19] <rxaviers> Yohann, about react-globalize, Andrew (from Twitter) is also using it, it's been currently mainteined by me and him
[12:28:07] <rxaviers> novapatch, is that because it's installed for each project? Each installation takes ~300MB
[12:28:24] <rxaviers> cahuja, there's definitely an interest for dust-globalize integration
[12:28:54] <rxaviers> For background, I've chatted very briefly with Chetan on IUC about it saying react-globalize could be used as a baseline. I think it would be great having this additional integration.
[12:29:07] <Yohann> rxaviers, nothing we've encountered yet
[12:29:21] <novapatch> rxaviers: exactly. not a blocker or anything, but it surprised some people.
[12:29:54] <rxaviers> Yohann, ok, just let me know if you need any other detail than the short mentioning I did above.
[12:30:57] <rxaviers> novapatch, oh, right. I feel the same pain currently and we gotta think into a solution for that. One approach could be to keep the CLDR-data in a user common location, shared by installations.
[12:31:28] <rxaviers> novapatch, please can you ask someone of your team to file an issue on https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr-data-npm about it?
[12:31:38] <novapatch> ok
[12:31:41] <rxaviers> It will help us keep track and solve that.
[12:31:59] <Yohann> Have you guys seen globalize run in a JSP / Javascript environment using Spring and Jquery?
[12:32:25] <Yohann> The javascript framework is backbone in our case
[12:32:51] <rxaviers> I havent personally seen. Have you jzaefferer?
[12:33:14] <rxaviers> cahuja, about dust-globalize integration, do you want to get this started? I make myself available for answering your questions.
[12:33:19] <Yohann> And Jawr for postprocess an bundle
[12:33:31] <Yohann> And Jawr for postprocess and bundle
[12:34:43] <rxaviers> Globalize should run in any JS env that supports ES5
[12:35:21] <rxaviers> Obviously, should is idealistic and there's a difference from it and actually running :)
[12:36:34] <novapatch> one feature we'll want at some point is formatted ranges of numbers (ex: 5â10)
[12:36:39] <novapatch> I'll open an issue for that
[12:36:50] <rxaviers> please, do so
[12:37:16] <rxaviers> That's then entering into the 2nd question I'd like to ask you: is there any requirements you don't see in Globalize now that you'd like to see?
[12:37:26] <rxaviers> So, number ranges
[12:38:08] <globalize-commit> [globalize] andersem closed issue #556: How do I format the year with two digits? http://git.io/vBgsO
[12:39:33] <rxaviers> it seems all at the moment.
[12:39:39] <rxaviers> A 3rd question: is there anything else you'd like to ask?
[12:39:57] <Yohann> We sometime gets things like phone validation, address validation but I don't think it must live in Globalize
[12:40:22] <Yohann> As it is not found in the CLDR
[12:40:50] <rxaviers> yeap, those features would have little intersection with the library.
[12:41:53] <novapatch> phone and address validation is related to country but not strongly to language
[12:42:36] <rxaviers> Maybe cldr.js could be of help there for dealing with the locale information.
[12:43:16] <Yohann> I have to get going now
[12:43:24] <rxaviers> Before we end then
[12:43:28] <rxaviers> Some Globalize updates, as you may have already noticed we now have Unit formatting thanks to Andrew (Twitter) who got this new featured finished.
[12:43:42] <rxaviers> Master currently holds 1.1.0-rc code
[12:44:03] <globalize-commit> [globalize] patch opened issue #562: support formatted ranges of numbers http://git.io/vRGMb
[12:44:03] <rxaviers> It's technically close to 1.1.0. What's holding is basically a blog post telling about it.
[12:44:31] <rxaviers> The plan was having a quick chat anyway
[12:44:38] <Yohann> Thanks for all the awesome work
[12:44:40] <rxaviers> and make sure you're not being blocked
[12:44:49] <rxaviers> and have a quick and free channel for communicating any needs
[12:45:01] <Yohann> Yeah, great initiative
[12:45:02] <novapatch> the unit formatting is a great feature
[12:45:10] <Yohann> After seeing you in person a few weeks back :)
[12:45:18] <rxaviers> hehe
[12:45:21] <rxaviers> Thank you all
[12:45:31] <Yohann> Have a nice rest of the day
[12:45:34] <rxaviers> Hope to see you all soon again next time and have you guys involved
[12:46:16] <rxaviers> Thanks for joining Yohann, I'll stay a little longer in case novapatch and cahuja want to discuss anything else
[12:47:05] <rxaviers> if not, thanks for joining too.
[12:47:16] <rxaviers> always feel free to reach
[12:47:22] <rxaviers> out
[12:47:25] <novapatch> that's all I have for now, thanks!
[12:47:50] <novapatch> and range ticket created: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/562
[12:48:14] <rxaviers> awesome! thx
[12:49:25] <ankk> rxaviers, can i use Globalize v1 with jquery.validate.globalize ?
[12:49:42] <ankk> i get errors like Globalize.parseFloat is not a function
[12:49:55] <rxaviers> ankk, oh there's a blog post about it, let me find
[12:50:38] <rxaviers> http://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2015/10/jquery-validation-globalize-hits-10.html
[12:53:16] <ankk> thank you
[12:54:50] <cahuja> Thank you. I will stay in touch about the dust integration. Great work on the library again.
[12:55:05] <cahuja> Have a nice day everyone
[12:56:59] <rxaviers> thanks cahuja, keep in touch
