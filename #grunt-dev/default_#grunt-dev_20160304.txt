[12:07:29] <vladikoff> shama, heya, so what do we need to publish rc2? I'm gonna update the plugins now
[12:13:33] <shama> vladikoff: Yeah Im just slow getting each of the plugins updated
[12:13:47] <vladikoff> shama, there was a glob update on grunt-core
[14:28:17] <vladikoff> shama, just fyi, I am debugging something in nodeunit, https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-nodeunit/blob/master/tasks/nodeunit.js#L271
[14:28:31] <vladikoff> shama, hooking to process.stdout.write in node 5.7 is not working properly
[14:30:37] <vladikoff> shama, in Ubuntu :)
