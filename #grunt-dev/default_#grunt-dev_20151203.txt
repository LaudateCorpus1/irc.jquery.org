[10:35:40] <ben_alman> in a call, gimme a few mins
[10:35:44] <ben_alman> feel free to type
[10:35:50] <ben_alman> just know i won't be able to respond for a few
[10:36:15] <vladikoff> ben_alman, gruntjs.com is down and probably needs an ip reset, was the domain on namecheap? I used to see it in the list but now in their new interface it does not show for me anymore
[10:36:25] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:36:33] <ben_alman> let me see
[10:37:11] <vladikoff> ben_alman, dns needs changing to 54.243.180.66
[10:37:12] <ben_alman> what ip should it be
[10:37:35] <vladikoff> ben_alman, from 50.16.200.158
[10:37:51] <ben_alman> ok done
[10:37:54] <ben_alman> give it 5 mins
[10:38:00] <vladikoff> ben_alman , thanks Ben :D
[10:38:08] <ben_alman> didn't i give you access to admin the namecheap?
[10:38:20] <vladikoff> ben_alman, yeap but then they changed their UI
[10:38:29] <vladikoff> ben_alman, now it is not there anymore
[10:38:33] <ben_alman> i see it all at https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/gruntjs.com/advancedns
[10:38:44] <vladikoff> ben_alman, "No Records Found"
[10:39:00] <ben_alman> ok after this call i'll try to add you back
[10:39:01] <ben_alman> weird
[10:49:40] <ben_alman> btw does it make sense for us to have a weekly checkin about grunt stuff? because i want to contribute and get things moving forward, but i really don't have time to do grunt stuff daily /cc @DaveMethvin|away vladikoff
[10:50:26] <ben_alman> @vladikoff: it shows "vladikoff" as a domain manager here
[10:50:38] <vladikoff> ben_alman, checking ...
[10:51:58] <vladikoff> ben_alman, ah i see it now, THANKS!!
[10:52:31] <vladikoff> ben_alman, weekly checkin makes sense, but scheduling it could be a little rough, need to check with shama also
[10:53:50] <ben_alman> yeah
[10:53:58] <ben_alman> i just know there are all these emails going around
[10:54:00] <ben_alman> and issues robaby
[10:54:07] <ben_alman> probably
[10:54:14] <ben_alman> but i don't have the time to check in that much
[10:54:15] <vladikoff> robaby!
[10:54:18] <ben_alman> i can definitely do a weekly thing
[10:54:20] <ben_alman> haha
[10:54:27] <ben_alman> as long as others are helping day-to-day
