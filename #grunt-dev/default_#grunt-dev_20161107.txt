[15:37:36] <cspotcode> Can anyone confirm if the js foundation's CLA page is working?  I just submitted a PR for grunt, and I've been directed here to sign the CLA: https://js.foundation/CLA/ but there is no form for me to submit
[15:39:44] <cspotcode> I'm actually being directed to http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/, which redirects to js.foundation/CLA/
