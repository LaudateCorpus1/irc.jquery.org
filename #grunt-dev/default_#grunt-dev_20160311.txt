[14:29:44] <vladikoff> shama, should we just ship 1.0.0 instead of rc2?
[14:29:54] <vladikoff> shama, (due to npm's >= fail)
[14:33:16] <shama> vladikoff: or just release rc2 and 1.0.0 shortly after. That issue is so annoying
[14:33:29] <shama> I mean, should we just remove peerDeps?
[14:33:32] <vladikoff> shama, what's your thinking behind "shortly after"
[14:33:50] <vladikoff> shama, we can but other plugins already did the >= 0.4.5
[14:33:57] <vladikoff> shama, and some authors like using it
[14:33:59] <shama> vladikoff: like a week pending anything major
[14:34:09] <shama> yeah dang
[14:34:16] <shama> ok... i guess we should just release 1.0.0
[14:34:28] <shama> We still got to get the rest of the contrib plugins updated though
[14:34:37] <vladikoff> shama, i did
[14:34:48] <vladikoff> shama, i think everything is done except watch
[14:34:57] <shama> oh really? nice!
[14:35:18] <shama> I was only following on this issue: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/1460
[14:35:57] <vladikoff> shama, ah okay, i didn't add links to commits but I published a bunch of 1.0.0 of contrib plugins
[14:36:28] <shama> vladikoff: ok, give me the weekend to check over last bits and then let's plan to release 1.0.0 early next week
[14:36:36] <vladikoff> shama, awesome
[14:37:06] <vladikoff> shama, it's better for me to do it after Wednesday i think
[14:38:08] <shama> vladikoff: sounds good. ive been swamped at work... next week isn't going to be better either so I'll try and do as much as I can this weekend. Hopefully not much to do.
[14:38:20] <vladikoff> shama, got it
