[16:16:41] <ben_alman> it's so awesome to see you all working on grunt
[16:16:47] <ben_alman> thank you all
[16:21:40] <steveoh> it's saved me so much time
[16:21:58] <steveoh> are you going to get your hands dirty in grunt again ben_alman?
[16:22:17] <ben_alman> steveoh: i want to, i have so many ideas for things that can be done, but i just can't manage it
[16:22:37] <ben_alman> i don't have the energy to dedicate to it like i once did
[16:22:52] <steveoh> burn out?
[16:22:58] <ben_alman> yeah, big time
[16:23:27] <ben_alman> it was too much responsibility
[16:23:39] <ben_alman> so many people using grunt, and i felt i had to do everything right all the time
[16:24:09] <ben_alman> and i kept getting stuck on decisions that needed to be made, because there was no right answer, and anything i chose might've made things more difficult for someone
[16:24:19] <ben_alman> so i just didn't do anything anymore
[16:24:24] <ben_alman> and felt a ton of guilt and stress
[16:24:33] <ben_alman> so now i'm taking space from it
[16:25:20] <ben_alman> the last project i worked on didn't even use grunt. i used webpack, babel, eslint, mocha and a bunch of other things to do a whole react website, and it worked perfectly
[16:25:35] <ben_alman> but the other one i worked on totally used grunt :P
[16:25:44] <steveoh> yeah i was curious about that
[16:31:31] <steveoh> ben_alman: have you written down your ideas in issues or somewhere?
[16:31:48] <ben_alman> some are filed in issues even 3 years old
[16:31:51] <ben_alman> heh
[16:31:57] <ben_alman> others were in conversations with people
