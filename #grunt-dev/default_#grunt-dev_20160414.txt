[15:05:06] <ben_alman> shama vladikoff are you guys on any of the jquery foundation email lists? if you aren't and want to be, perhaps DaveMethvin|away can add you, sometimes the emails are interesting
[15:06:03] <shama> ben_alman: im not, thanks! DaveMethvin|away, my email is kyle@dontkry.com
[15:07:30] <vladikoff> i don't have an email yet
