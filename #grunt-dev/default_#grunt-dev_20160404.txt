[14:46:53] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: how about adding Appveyor for grunt-lib-phantomjs?
[14:47:03] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, sure
[14:47:07] <XhmikosR> ok
[14:47:29] <XhmikosR> shama: are we any close to a new grunt-contrib-internal release?
[14:49:08] <XhmikosR> also I was wondering, shouldn't we use grunt-contrib-internal for grunt-lib-phantomjs?
[15:59:15] <vladikoff> shama, should we ship 1.0?
[16:13:52] <shama> XhmikosR: Sorry, I haven't had time to work on grunt-contrib-internal lately.
[16:14:12] <shama> vladikoff: Yep! Unless there is anything else?
[16:14:23] <vladikoff> shama, 1.0 and a blog post?
[16:14:57] <vladikoff> shama, i need to update the blog post and it should be ready to go ?
[16:14:59] <shama> +1
[16:15:13] <vladikoff> shama, ok are you gonna be around in 3 hours?
[16:15:24] <shama> vladikoff: ill be around
[16:15:35] <vladikoff> shama, ok let's aim to npm publish in 3 hours
[16:16:01] <XhmikosR> shama: basically we only need an option to skip the CI normalization. Other than that we can make a new release. No hurry, just wanted to remind it to you
[16:16:01] <shama> My week is looking pretty good too, so I'll be around if anything bad happens
[16:16:21] <shama> XhmikosR: Cool, I'll take a look this evening

[19:16:19] <shama> vladikoff: cool!
[19:17:09] <vladikoff> shama, messed up the date of the blog post
[19:17:29] <shama> whoops
[19:17:32] <vladikoff> fail
[19:17:33] <vladikoff> loool
[19:18:26] <shama> not a real failure though, it's not live
[19:18:47] <vladikoff> shama, I felt like a failure for a sec there
[19:18:58] <shama> vladikoff: still a winner in my book
[19:19:02] <vladikoff> awww
[19:19:18] <shama> Thanks for handling the release btw
[19:22:46] <vladikoff> shama, stage check http://gruntjs.stage.jquery.net/blog/2016-04-04-grunt-1.0.0-released
[19:23:46] <vladikoff> shama, ok you wanna npm publish ?
[19:24:28] <shama> vladikoff: looks good... sure, hold on to yer butts
[19:27:27] <shama> $ npm publish
[19:27:28] <shama> + grunt@1.0.0
[19:27:31] <shama> its done
[19:28:01] <vladikoff> oh snao
[19:29:16] <shama> uh oh
[19:29:21] <vladikoff> shama, wat
[19:29:30] <shama> Looks like it didnt like the grunt-cli bin
[19:29:38] <vladikoff> shama, oh ??
[19:32:08] <shama> vladikoff: hmm weird, other projects are fine but when trying to update ynab, https://gist.github.com/shama/6e11956805864cb230ea7ce7314593ac
[19:33:08] <vladikoff> shama, ok I'm fine here
[19:33:49] <vladikoff> shama, try nuking your `node_modules/.bin` ??
[19:34:16] <shama> vladikoff: yeah rm -rf node_modules worked... I think it was in a funky state with grunt-cli already there
[19:34:21] <vladikoff> oh well
[19:34:28] <shama> Trying to repro on a fresh folder though
[19:35:26] <shama> Im getting this for grunt-contrib-clean: npm ERR! peerinvalid Peer grunt-contrib-clean@1.0.0 wants grunt@>= 0.4.5
[19:35:44] <vladikoff> shama, that's probably a lie
[19:35:47] <vladikoff> shama, is that the only one
[19:35:48] <shama> Does >= just not work with npm?
[19:36:02] <shama> npm ERR! peerinvalid Peer grunt-beep@1.0.0 wants grunt@>=0.4.0
[19:36:07] <shama> npm ERR! peerinvalid Peer grunt-coffeelint@0.0.15 wants grunt@~0.4
[19:36:09] <vladikoff> shama, gist everything
[19:36:13] <vladikoff> shama, it is " Peer grunt-coffeelint@0.0.15 wants grunt@~0.4"
[19:36:14] <shama> just those atm
[19:36:20] <vladikoff> shama , it lists everything because it is dumb
[19:36:28] <vladikoff> shama, so you need to fix  Peer grunt-coffeelint@0.0.15 wants grunt@~0.4
[19:36:41] <vladikoff> because that one has grunt@~0.4
[19:36:43] <shama> right
[19:37:23] <shama> I think the maintainer is gone on that project
[19:37:29] <shama> oh well
[19:39:15] <vladikoff> shama, https://twitter.com/gruntjs/status/717134434357501952
[19:39:15] <b-ot> (vladikoff) @gruntjs (Grunt): Grunt 1.0.0 released! Read more at https://t.co/jwgs6fBkUV https://t.co/mvtQTeTVnz (8 seconds ago)

[19:39:55] <shama> oh nm
[19:41:28] <vladikoff> magical
[19:41:34] <shama> ^5
[19:41:52] <shama> so now we wait for the issues to roll in
[19:42:06] <vladikoff> shama, "WHY MY EPEERINVALID U JERK
[19:42:12] <vladikoff> shama, that's the issue template ^
[19:42:31] <shama> oh good, dont want to make them any more angry
[19:43:10] <shama> btw... npm WARN unmet dependency > EPEERINVALID
[19:43:26] <shama> I was hitting that this morning. It's stupid.
[19:43:42] <vladikoff> yeah
[19:44:20] <shama> Then for some reason npm didn't extract grunt/lib/util/task.js
[19:44:36] <shama> I guess we're using too many deps
[19:46:07] <vladikoff> wat
[19:46:10] <vladikoff> :(
[19:50:45] <shama> first! https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/1491#issuecomment-205548157
[19:53:07] <vladikoff> good times
[19:53:34] <shama> If we get that a lot, think we should patch in a bin?
[19:54:10] <vladikoff> shama, how
[19:54:50] <shama> Create a bin that looks better for grunt-cli/bin/grunt
[19:55:35] <vladikoff> ah
[19:55:36] <vladikoff> maybe
[20:02:12] <shama> We can start updating the plugins to https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint/commit/b10e7b68ac09bb6d4ba831e1e6bdc91f7802c594
[20:02:29] <vladikoff> shama, sgtm!
