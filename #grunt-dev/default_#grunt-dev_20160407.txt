[08:11:17] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: should I commit the CI normalization separately for the contrib plugins where it was missed?
[09:37:54] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: when you are around ping me
[10:11:00] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i am a round
[10:11:33] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I started updating all deps for the contrib plugins
[10:11:47] <XhmikosR> what should I do about the CI configs? Should I make separate configs?
[10:14:47] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, separate why?
[10:15:07] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: well the dep is updated, but someone didn't run grunt :p
[10:15:43] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, that's fine, but how will ci configs be separate?
[10:15:50] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, you mean separate commits or something else?
[10:16:04] <XhmikosR> separate commit with just running grunt and updating the CI configs
[10:18:54] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , ah yes that's fine
[10:19:09] <XhmikosR> ok, for the rest I'll make sure we have a PR
[10:53:58] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I was looking at that issue with downloadPlugins on Windows.
[10:54:18] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i thought windows runs bash now, so all is fixed
[10:54:28] <XhmikosR> not yet :p
[10:54:45] <XhmikosR> to be honest this I don't see how it's only a Windows issue
[10:54:55] <XhmikosR>   request({url: url, json: true}, function handlePlugin(error, response, body) {
[10:54:55] <XhmikosR>     console.log('>>> error:', error);
[10:54:56] <XhmikosR>     console.log('>>> response.statusCode:', response.statusCode);
[10:54:56] <XhmikosR>     if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
[10:54:56] <XhmikosR>       callback(null, condensePlugin(body));
[10:54:56] <XhmikosR>     } else {
[10:54:58] <XhmikosR>       console.log('Failed to get data for:', name);
[10:55:00] <XhmikosR>       callback(null, null);
[10:55:02] <XhmikosR>     }
[10:55:05] <XhmikosR> error is always null
[10:55:29] <XhmikosR> and response.code is 200
[11:31:53] <XhmikosR> ok so here is what I get
[11:31:53] <XhmikosR> >>> name: grunt-dploy, error: Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 52.23.180.84:443
[11:31:54] <XhmikosR> Failed to get data for: grunt-dploy
[11:44:22] <vladikoff> shama, wait so sprintf was in lodash then got removed
[11:45:04] <shama> vladikoff: stuff gets moved around a bit there. I know they were removing a lot of aliases
[11:45:42] <vladikoff> shama, only thing i can find is https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/1027
[11:45:58] <vladikoff> shama, looking at https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine/issues/232
[11:48:14] <shama> Weird, I dont see it anywhere anymore
[11:48:29] <vladikoff> probably somewhere in lodash 2 logs
[11:48:33] <vladikoff> lol
[11:48:40] <shama> oh nm, it's part of https://www.npmjs.com/package/underscore.string
[11:49:23] <shama> we should use that or another sprintf library and replace it
[11:49:33] <vladikoff> ahhhhh
[11:50:31] <XhmikosR> hehe I had a branch about this but no one looked into it so I deleted it
[11:50:52] <XhmikosR> and my comment was that I had left snprintf because I didn't know if we wanted yet another dep :P
[11:51:37] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, shama, ok what lib did you have in mind?
[11:52:08] <XhmikosR> my finding back then was underscore.string too
[11:52:46] <shama> ah dang, sorry XhmikosR
[11:52:58] <shama> Yeah I'd go with underscore.string. That is what we used in the past
[11:53:03] <vladikoff> k
[11:53:15] <vladikoff> I guess i'll patch it
[11:54:12] <XhmikosR> ok I finally found the reason about https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/issues/171
[11:54:28] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, is it windows vista
[11:54:29] <XhmikosR> I'm getting ETIMEDOUT for some plugins, like 190
[11:54:39] <XhmikosR> no, Windows 7 64-bit
[11:54:58] <XhmikosR> I tried setting up a 30000 (30s) timeout for `request` but still the same
[11:59:57] <XhmikosR> ok that's enough trying to debug this for now
[12:00:52] <vladikoff> ok
[12:06:12] <XhmikosR> struggling with my gruntjs.com branch now. Trying to see what else I can split safely
[12:06:13] <XhmikosR> https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/compare/xmr-dev?w=1
[12:06:23] <XhmikosR> https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/commit/64b3cc3c3bd0193cac1addc11d49e38a60efa68a
[12:06:24] <XhmikosR> https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/commit/404e300c54a5e5e66675d82090bd6f93e4541fbe
[12:06:29] <XhmikosR> https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/commit/10826f8370d7671c351ac010acf1c8b524da2f81
[12:06:42] <XhmikosR> those should be fine to merge if one of you confirms
[12:21:14] <XhmikosR> https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fgruntjs.com%2F
[12:21:42] <XhmikosR> btw @shama should we change the contrib plugins' license too?
[12:22:27] <shama> XhmikosR: I think we should wait until the transition to jQuery Foundation is complete
[12:23:35] <XhmikosR> oh OK, I thought it was done when I saw the license change in grunt itself
[17:55:08] <XhmikosR> I don't get the failures with the latest lodash and contrib-jasmine :/
[17:55:32] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, test doesn't cover phantom error
[17:56:29] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: but I don't get why it happens just with the latest lodash
[17:56:45] <XhmikosR> I checked all the lodash uses and they seem fine
[17:57:18] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i already patched the thing, but _.sprintf or w/e doesn't exit
[17:57:33] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I don't think we mean the same
[17:57:43] <XhmikosR> https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine/jobs/121363495
[17:57:44] <vladikoff> oh ok
[17:57:58] <XhmikosR> that is what I don't get
[17:58:01] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , ah yea i dunno what's that
[17:58:06] <XhmikosR> and if I use the old lodash it works
[17:58:34] <XhmikosR> we use uniq, compact, template and forEach
[17:58:42] <XhmikosR> those haven't changed as far as I can tell
[17:59:03] <XhmikosR> and that error is from
[17:59:04] <XhmikosR>     phantomjs.on('fail.timeout', function() {
[17:59:04] <XhmikosR>       grunt.log.writeln();
[17:59:04] <XhmikosR>       grunt.warn('PhantomJS timed out, possibly due to an unfinished async spec.', 90);
[17:59:04] <XhmikosR>     });
[17:59:11] <XhmikosR> really weird
[18:01:44] <XhmikosR> I guess the PR is ready for now, lodash is for when someone else figure it out
