[13:30:50] <XhmikosR> shama: ping
[13:36:08] <XhmikosR> shama: please look and merge https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-internal/commit/73c84eeda5e0a116023cbab18ca1069ce718ce6f
[13:36:27] <XhmikosR> and about pug, I made a branch, push there please https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-pug/tree/rename
[13:36:40] <XhmikosR> that is why I insisted to make a branch and not commit directly to master
[13:38:02] <XhmikosR> I also fixed AppVeyor for pug
[13:38:16] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yaay
[13:38:55] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: pug is broken atm, even in the rename branch
[13:39:00] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , :(
[13:39:05] <XhmikosR> I feel shama didn't do it carefully, no offense
[13:39:33] <XhmikosR> or we miss something obvious, we overdid it somewhere :p
[13:39:48] <XhmikosR> anyway bbl, but shama please look at internal and pug later
[13:45:30] <shama> XhmikosR: oh sorry, I expected a ton of things to break renaming it (and why I originally just created a new repo for it). I think it's ok pushing directly to master.
[13:46:04] <XhmikosR> shama: but we could just use a branch; they are free and we have CI
[13:46:26] <XhmikosR> we would have reduced the chances to commit something broken
[13:48:01] <shama> master is a development branch to me. Why shouldn't we push directly to it?
[13:57:11] <XhmikosR> because even if it is development, it's a big change and branches are free for development
[13:57:48] <XhmikosR> anyway, what's done is done. Please look at the internal branch because I broke CI normalization the other day. I just want you to confirm before merging
[14:07:28] <vladikoff> boom
[15:16:46] <shama> XhmikosR: I’ll explain why I think it’s ok to push to master because I don’t want you to think I’m being careless. I think branches are good for when you’re unsure of the changes or need someone else to review. For most of my projects, if someone contributes a significant amount, I make them an owner and encourage them to commit directly to the project as needed.
[15:16:52] <shama> In doing so, I notice the quality of code increases as they are no longer using me as a crutch for review. It also saves both of us time avoiding unnecessary reviews. If you have access to a project, it means we trust you.
[15:16:59] <shama> For example the CI normalization regression fix probably doesn’t need my review. I trust you have tested the code and it’s a good fix. It’s completely up to you though. Feel free to lean on our reviews if you need to but I’m just letting you know that you don’t have to.
[18:29:36] <TheMolp> Hi there, anyone available for a little help with a small plugin issue I'm experiencing?
[18:45:33] <vladikoff> TheMolp, what's up
[18:46:26] <TheMolp> Hi there :)
[18:48:48] <TheMolp> So, here is my pastebin : http://pastebin.com/df8hDkGk : . I have a much longer plugin that just isn't firing, and I've isolated it to dirToJson. Anything inside of the dirToJson blocks doesn't execute in anyway. The task it's self registers and runs, but nothing once it hits dirToJson. My full plugin code is here : http://pastebin.com/7GK577bc . T
[18:48:49] <TheMolp> his is my first plugin, so maybe I'm missing something fundamental? I see lots of console output, but again, nothing in dirToJson functions are ever executed. No errors, or warnings.
[18:49:02] <TheMolp> Thanks a ton in advance, I'd appreciate any sort of direction.
[18:51:01] <TheMolp> I understand it would be difficult to debug over chat like this, but if anything stands out right away to you I'd love to know :)
[18:52:44] <vladikoff> TheMolp, you forgot async?
[18:53:12] <vladikoff> TheMolp, see async example here: http://gruntjs.com/creating-tasks#custom-tasks
[18:54:15] <TheMolp> Interesting. If I isolate this code outside of a grunt plugin, it runs just fine
[18:54:19] <TheMolp> So maybe it's asynch.
[18:54:24] <TheMolp> I'll give that a try. Thank you :)
