[04:39:40] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I made some more progress. I'm almost done with clipboard.js integration too. But all my branches depend on the current PR so I'll wait until you review it
[12:35:31] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: is the live server updated manually or via a hook from the repo?
[12:38:45] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , stage should be updated from master http://stage.gruntjs.com/
[12:39:10] <XhmikosR> hmm still doesn't seem up to date to me
[12:39:20] <XhmikosR> Development: v1.0.1 (github) should be GitHub
[12:39:31] <XhmikosR> and the cursor doesn't blink either
[12:40:13] <vladikoff> maybe it got stuck :(
[12:40:58] <XhmikosR> or it's running ancient node
[12:53:46] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: should I put the doc images in gruntjs.com/src/img?
[12:54:51] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, maybe!
[12:55:01] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, does it pull from github right now?
[12:55:08] <XhmikosR> yes
[12:55:11] <vladikoff> XhmikosR hmmm
[12:55:13] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, actually leave it
[12:55:25] <XhmikosR> well now they are on a random repo
[12:55:29] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , rando?
[12:55:52] <XhmikosR> isaacdurazo/gruntjs.com/44-brand-guide/
[12:55:58] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, oh those!
[12:56:00] <XhmikosR> random meaning we don't have control
[12:56:10] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yeap we can pull those in
[12:56:14] <XhmikosR> it's 7 images
[12:56:22] <vladikoff> i got confused because i saw no images here https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-docs/tree/master/blog
[12:56:24] <XhmikosR> so I add them in gruntjs.com
[12:56:42] <vladikoff> yesss
[12:56:58] <XhmikosR> I still need to talk to whoever is in control of the server
[12:58:10] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, adam is busy at the moment with work stuff
[12:58:21] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i think the best thing to do is to have github issues open
[12:58:25] <vladikoff> XhmikosR such as the https one
[12:58:44] <XhmikosR> yes but we haven't got a reply for so long
[12:58:50] <XhmikosR> and now it seems stuck too
[13:22:07] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: do I release csslint 2.0.0?
[13:22:26] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, is it ready?
[13:23:24] <XhmikosR> well I hope so
[13:23:31] <XhmikosR> since the way tests are it's a mess IMO
[13:23:38] <XhmikosR> an error is an error and we should fail
[13:24:44] <XhmikosR> anyway, put it in your todo list to tag and publish v2.0.0
