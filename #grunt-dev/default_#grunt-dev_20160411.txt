[14:33:32] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: please publish grunt-contrib-less to npm
[14:33:39] <XhmikosR> or shama ^^
[14:33:41] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ok
[14:36:14] <XhmikosR> also vladikoff https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine/pull/233
[14:36:21] <XhmikosR> but let me rebase
[14:37:19] <XhmikosR> I also have https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-nodeunit/pull/47
[14:42:52] <XhmikosR> shama: something went wrong in the last grunt-contrib-internal release; the .travis.yml and appveyor.yml are beeing kept regardless of skipIfExists
[14:45:24] <XhmikosR> shama: or you wanted to skip overwriting them if they exist? Because I think my patch was that screwed this up :/
