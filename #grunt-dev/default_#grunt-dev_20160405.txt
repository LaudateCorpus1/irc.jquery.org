[00:01:54] <vladikoff> shama, ping
[00:12:58] <shama> vladikoff: yo
[00:13:34] <vladikoff> shama, thoughts on https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/1499#issuecomment-205623036 ?
[00:26:42] <shama> vladikoff: working on some ideas btw
[00:27:04] <vladikoff> shakes fist at npm
[00:28:12] <shama> a bin with require('grunt-cli/bin/grunt'); works but Im not sure about edge cases doing that
[01:42:00] <vladikoff> shama, just saw it
[01:46:22] <shama> vladikoff: let me know what you think of the fix. I didn't see any issues with it but it seemed too simple
[01:46:38] <vladikoff> shama, it fails this https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1500#issuecomment-205655662
[01:47:25] <shama> vladikoff: hmm dang... ok ill try some other things in the morning. thanks for checking
[01:47:51] <vladikoff> shama, yaaah :(
[03:16:13] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/jobs/120826088 shouldn't this go away since we have the relevant patch in your fork?
[11:53:17] <XhmikosR> the files property keeps bitting us in the ass today :/
[12:06:00] <shama> vladikoff: give npm i grunt-cli gruntjs/grunt#fixbin another try
[13:09:50] <vladikoff> shama, Works!
[13:09:51] <vladikoff> ship it!
[13:20:27] <vladikoff> shama, ok
[13:20:35] <vladikoff> shama, if i clone `grunt` and npm i it fails
[13:20:38] <vladikoff> shama, could you check?
[13:21:50] <vladikoff> shama, is that because grunt tries to install grunt ?
[13:21:55] <vladikoff> shama aka 1.0.0 ?
[13:40:25] <shama> vladikoff: checking...
[13:46:30] <shama> vladikoff: yeah, npm@2 its trying to install grunt as a peer dep
[13:47:50] <shama> vladikoff: how about this fancy trick... Add "grunt": "./", to the devDeps?
[13:49:04] <shama> Going to test that some more...
[13:49:25] <vladikoff> shama, probably won't work ben tried that before
[13:49:38] <shama> oh?
[13:50:34] <vladikoff> shama, gah cannot find it now hmm
[13:52:30] <shama> ah yep, doesnt work: https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt/builds/120955329 dang
[13:53:46] <vladikoff> shama, see https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3958
[14:10:19] <vladikoff> shama, ok wanna publish it?
[14:10:43] <shama> vladikoff: yeah, one sec...
[14:16:55] <shama> vladikoff: published
[14:17:42] <vladikoff> shama, thank you!!
[17:09:16] <xmr> Hi guys. It's XhmikosR. With the new version do we remove grunt-cli and just keep grunt?
[17:09:46] <xmr> Also what is the procedure for the new license and the contrib plug-ins?
[17:15:30] <vladikoff> xmr, hi
[17:16:46] <xmr> Hey @vladikoff
[17:25:03] <vladikoff> xmr, not sure about license
[17:25:17] <vladikoff> xmr, we can probably remove grunt-cli from contrib yas
[17:26:02] <xmr> So I'm generally one does not the client explicitly anymore?
[17:26:18] <xmr> *need the cli
[17:26:36] <vladikoff> xmr, my personal pattern is to only use grunt-cli locally
[17:26:38] <xmr> Autocorrection strikes again :p
[17:27:05] <vladikoff> xmr, this means i can just install one thing and get the cli
[17:27:17] <xmr> Yes but do I need it specified in the dependencies with version 1.0.0
[17:27:27] <vladikoff> xmr, in where
[17:28:07] <xmr> For local use I mean. Say for the contrib plug-ins for example
[17:28:47] <vladikoff> xmr, plugins don't need it listed in deps in plugins
[17:32:48] <xmr> All right I ll
[17:33:01] <xmr> I will double check and make pull requests
[17:33:16] <xmr> I still need some info about the license
[17:33:35] <xmr> Also shama we need a new internal release
[17:36:14] <vladikoff> xmr, do you just wanna release internal yourself?
[17:36:49] <vladikoff> xmr, i have some docs for that here: http://gruntjs.com/contributing#publishing-a-new-version
[17:39:40] <xmr> I don't have npm rights I think
[17:39:53] <vladikoff> xmr, if you can get to tag it I can publish it
[17:40:47] <xmr> OK I just need to verify how I can skip the CI normalization
[17:59:59] <xmr> shama: ping for the internal CI  skip
[20:28:54] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: do even though I get a warning when peerDeps is out of deate for grunt, things seem to work
[20:29:28] <XhmikosR> I haven't had a plugin fail which doesn't have >=0.4.x
[20:30:28] <XhmikosR> also, another thing, let's say one publishes a patch with >= 0.4.x, can we remove the peerDependecy in the next release?
[20:31:50] <XhmikosR> I publidhes grunt-contrib-internal 1.0.1 tag, please push to the npm @vladikoff
[20:32:27] <XhmikosR> I still wait for the clear instructions about the license from shama for the rest of the contrib plugins
