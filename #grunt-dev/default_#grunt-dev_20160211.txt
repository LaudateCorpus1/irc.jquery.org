[11:58:15] <shama> hold on to your butts
[12:27:07] <vladikoff> shama , lol
[12:27:27] <shama> just waiting on appveyor now
[12:43:39] <shama> `throw appveyor
[12:44:31] <shama> Going to merge anyways... arbitrary failure on the very last bit is just cruel
[12:45:06] <shama> fyi, all the tests passed just appveyor didnt mark as passed
[12:45:11] <shama> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gruntjs/grunt/build/100/job/x0d1geuqhsalo4up
[12:50:29] <vladikoff> shama, lol I'll tell them
[12:50:41] <shama> It seems like its the cache thing still
[12:51:06] <shama> Maybe we didnt have that commit in that PR that removed it though?
[12:52:39] <shama> (the commit that removed caching in apveyor)
[12:52:44] <vladikoff> shama, yeap!
[12:52:48] <vladikoff> shama, it was before
[12:52:52] <vladikoff> shama, needs rebase
[12:53:05] <shama> I rebased that PR but must not have pulled first
[12:53:13] <vladikoff> shama, ah
[12:53:28] <vladikoff> shama, I'm in a meeting for next 15-30 mins, one sec
[12:53:33] <shama> anyways, all tests will pass now and I'll push the release
[12:53:48] <shama> once the tests finish
[13:05:23] <shama> vladikoff: ok, publishing...
[13:07:37] <shama> it is done
[13:12:17] <vladikoff> shama, wowowo
[13:12:44] <vladikoff> shama, I guess the site does not show any of it https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt
[13:23:12] <shama> its not tagged latest
[13:23:18] <shama> its tagged rc1
[13:23:25] <vladikoff> shama, sorry i dm'd lodash@2.4.2: lodash@<3.0.0 is no longer maintained. Upgrade to lodash@^4.0.0
[13:23:40] <vladikoff> shama, is that fine
[13:26:16] <steveoh> ohh so is 1.0.0-rc1 the new shiz?
[13:26:18] <vladikoff> shama, blog post live http://gruntjs.com/blog/2016-02-11-grunt-1.0.0-rc1-released
[13:27:29] <vladikoff> steveoh, BUMPED
[13:27:35] <steveoh> holla
[13:36:33] <vladikoff> shama, ah it is https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-legacy-log/blob/master/package.json#L30 that is not updated yet
[13:36:40] <vladikoff> shama, is that okay?
[13:40:48] <vladikoff> eh w/e we can update that in rc2
[13:45:49] <steveoh> lodash was upgraded to ~4.3.0. was in the blog post
[13:46:05] <vladikoff> steveoh, not in a sub-dep of log, but no worries
[13:51:52] <shama> vladikoff: We cant update to lodash@4.3 there yet because of bindAll() https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-legacy-log/commit/b51e04f8894067226aff76aabb74ea94e848a33f
[13:52:05] <shama> But its still >3
[13:52:09] <vladikoff> shama, yesssss
[13:52:37] <shama> So now comes integration and fixing peer deps.
[13:52:52] <vladikoff> shama, yeah i made some progress
[13:53:08] <shama> Such as jquery/jquery, once I got passed the peer dep issues where grunt is ~0.4.0, all tests are green.
[13:53:11] <shama> with 0 changes
[13:53:36] <shama> same for all the projects ive tested
[13:54:31] <vladikoff> shama, I'll be sending the PRs either this weekend or next week
[13:55:01] <steveoh> what's next?
[13:55:50] <vladikoff> steveoh, need to get plugins to fix their peerDeps
[13:56:04] <steveoh> could a bot do that?
[13:56:04] <vladikoff> steveoh, then check issues with rc1 and release rc2 or 1.0.0
[13:58:28] <steveoh> i don't see a rc2 or 1.0.0 label or milestone vladikoff
[13:58:56] <vladikoff> steveoh, yeah we didn't get a chance to even chat about that yet :)
[13:59:37] <steveoh> haha, ok
[14:02:29] <steveoh> vladikoff: so if i see npm ERR! peer dep missing: grunt@>=0.4.0, required by grunt-contrib-clean@0.7.0
[14:02:39] <steveoh> the task still runs
[14:02:50] <steveoh> is it using the 1.0.0-rc1 version still?
[14:03:18] <steveoh> and i should issue a pr to that plugin to remove the peer dependency? do you have a little wiki on how that should change or was it all in that blog post
[14:03:47] <vladikoff> steveoh, http://gruntjs.stage.jquery.net/blog/2016-02-11-grunt-1.0.0-rc1-released#peer-dependencies changing to "grunt": ">=0.4.0" is probably the best strategy right now
[14:03:51] <vladikoff> steveoh, woops
[14:04:00] <steveoh> ok
[14:04:04] <vladikoff> steveoh, http://gruntjs.com/blog/2016-02-11-grunt-1.0.0-rc1-released#peer-dependencies
[14:04:22] <steveoh> so that is the pr i should submit to some plugin authors?
[14:04:56] <vladikoff> steveoh, yeap example here: https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer/pull/121
[14:05:20] <steveoh> https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-bump/blob/master/package.json#L61
[14:05:42] <vladikoff> steveoh, yeap a bunch of plugins have this fixed already :)
[14:05:52] <steveoh> this tossed a warning in npm3 like you said
[14:08:31] <steveoh> vladikoff: what about https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/blob/master/package.json#L25-L26
[14:11:05] <vladikoff> steveoh, that's fine
[14:11:18] <vladikoff> steveoh, it's basically plugin's "devDeps", do not matter for plugin consumers
[14:20:48] <shama> on a fresh install of 1.0.0-rc1, Im still seeing that lodash deprecation message. So I guess we'll need to find the origin and fix in rc2
[14:21:53] <steveoh> any ideas why the update to glob causes `glob pattern string required`
[14:26:01] <shama> steveoh: I dont. If you run into an issue, could you post it to github (and look into it as well)? Then we can address in rc2.
[14:26:47] <steveoh> yeah i'm wondering where to start looking, grunt, the plugin that is tossing or in my old working plugin params
[14:27:47] <shama> There is likely going to be a lot of breaking changes as many major versions have past on the deps we updated. At the very least, it would be good to know what is breaking and include a work around in the changelog for people.
[14:28:51] <vladikoff> shama, which version of lodash?
[14:30:05] <shama> npm WARN deprecated lodash@2.4.2: lodash@<3.0.0 is no longer maintained. Upgrade to lodash@^4.0.0
[14:30:21] <shama> in a fresh folder with npm i grunt@1.0.0-rc1
[14:32:10] <shama> looks like grunt-legacy-log-utils
[14:32:23] <shama> (i didnt know that existed)
[14:32:42] <shama> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-legacy-log-utils
[14:33:54] <vladikoff> shama, added here https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/1460
[14:47:48] <steveoh> i just submitted 5 peer dependency PRs
[14:49:18] <vladikoff> steveoh, yessss
[14:51:33] <vladikoff> steveoh, i was planning to automate this process by looking at http://grunt.herokuapp.com/plugins where versions are ~
[14:51:59] <steveoh> that would be awesome
[15:14:30] <vladikoff> thanks for all your help shama and all the work you put into this
[15:15:48] <shama> no u vladikoff!
