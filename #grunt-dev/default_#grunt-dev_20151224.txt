[06:07:42] <thorn0> Hi. My question is about grunt-contrib-concat. It has really serious troubles with performance when sourcemaps are enabled. In September, a PR https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat/pull/137 was submitted. It really improves the situation, but still isn't merged for some reason.
[06:07:54] <thorn0> Furthermore, there are a few other simple things that will surely help with the performance: updating the "source-map" dependency, optimizing regexps, disabling sourcemaps for a subset of the files specified in an option. The plugin doesn't look unmaintained though. The last commit was made 10d ago. Some other PRs have been merged. Anyways, if it can help, I'd like to offer my help with maintaining it.
