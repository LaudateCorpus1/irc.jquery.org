[12:25:27] <alwin> Hi, i think i found a bug using this.async(). Whats the best way to file it?
[12:26:38] <alwin> In my fullyblown example I've to meta Tasks. the Last task of the first meta task and the first one of the second meta task both are using this.async() to handly async file operations
[12:27:35] <alwin> unfortunately when the last task of the first meta task calls his done() it also triggers somehow (don't know why and how) the done() of the first task of the second meta task
[12:29:05] <alwin> so I've sth like: registerTask('meta1', ['m1_1', 'm1_2_async']); registerTask('meta2', ['m2_1_async', 'm2_2']); registerTask('default', ['meta1','meta2']);
[12:30:02] <alwin> I can't see how the tests are structured, so its hard for me to cover and file it by a test
