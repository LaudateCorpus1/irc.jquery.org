[12:35:14] <cspotcode> According to https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/1403#issuecomment-159063720, anyone interested in grunt development should triage open issues and pull requests.  Should we be assigning labels or milestones?  Or just commenting to point out potential blockers,  breaking API changes, etc?
