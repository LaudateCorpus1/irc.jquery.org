[11:12:24] <XhmikosR> Hi, guys
[11:19:46] <vladikoff> hey XhmikosR :)
[11:19:53] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, I thought you hated IRC or something :P
[11:23:07] <XhmikosR> no, I didn't know there was a dev channel :/
[11:23:14] <XhmikosR> I'm always logged in on #grunt
[11:23:23] <vladikoff> ah
[11:24:08] <XhmikosR> looking into making some updates for gruntjs.com
[11:24:13] <XhmikosR> wow, things are old there
[11:25:23] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, sure!
[11:25:41] <XhmikosR> do we have an official Grunt style?
[11:25:50] <XhmikosR> I mean for JS code
[11:27:02] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, we got http://gruntjs.com/contributing#syntax
[11:28:09] <XhmikosR> is that up to date? If yes, I will use that for now
[11:28:53] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yeah i think so
[11:31:13] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: gruntjs.com/tasks/lib/plugins.js and gruntjs.com/tasks/lib/docs.js seem to be identical
[11:32:07] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ah yes that's weird
[11:33:10] <XhmikosR> my local tree is full of changes, but I'll add it in my list if no one else removes it
[11:36:43] <XhmikosR> and I think we need to add Travi for gruntjs.com, just to be safe
[11:36:50] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, sounds good
[11:37:03] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, I'm debugging this issue with nopt for grunt-cli at the moment, it's a weird one
[11:37:51] <XhmikosR> which issue? Regression?
[11:38:08] <vladikoff> XhmikosR  ,yeah  https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli/issues/101#issuecomment-199867256
[11:38:19] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, on ubuntu only >_>
[11:41:14] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, hm nvm it is not ubuntu only, anyway.
[11:41:27] <XhmikosR> we don't have tests for CLI, right?
[11:44:04] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, does not look like it :(
[11:55:18] <XhmikosR> so no spaces before and after } { ?
[11:55:54] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, honestly, check the existing files in gruntjs/grunt :)
[12:07:39] <XhmikosR> so vladikoff, which one should we keep? lib/docs.js or lib/plugins.js?
[12:08:10] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i think it needs to renamed to something common, checking
[12:08:19] <XhmikosR> nvm, I'll leave it for later
[12:08:29] <XhmikosR> let me first manage to build everything with the new jade
[12:10:33] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: do you have gruntjs.com src checked out? Can you do grunt?
[12:11:06] <XhmikosR> it fails for me here
[12:11:06] <XhmikosR> Reading node_modules/grunt-docs/Contributing.md...OK
[12:11:07] <XhmikosR> Processing source...>> TypeError: Cannot read property 'join' of undefined
[12:11:07] <XhmikosR> Warning: Jade failed to compile. Use --force to continue.
[12:12:09] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, works for me here with fresh node_modules
[12:12:29] <XhmikosR> ok at least it's broken in my branch only :)
[12:14:45] <XhmikosR> so it's the grunt docs target that fails for some reason
[12:18:19] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: does grunt downloadPlugins work without any errors for you?
[12:20:11] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , hm getting "Failed to get data for:" here :(
[12:20:22] <XhmikosR> oh OK so that is already broken
[12:20:32] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, looks like they changed something
[12:21:04] <XhmikosR> https://skimdb.npmjs.com/registry/ + name
[12:21:30] <XhmikosR> that works at least
[12:21:36] <XhmikosR> I'll open a new issue to track this
[12:38:56] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I pushed my branch; only `grunt docs` fails and I can't solve it so far. After than I can look into updating some of the front-end assets
[12:39:31] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, got it
[12:39:48] <XhmikosR> so, I need someone's help to solve `grunt docs`
[12:53:26] <XhmikosR> so should I go with jQuery 1.x or 2.x?
[13:19:02] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, 2.x sounds cool ;)
[13:20:10] <XhmikosR> yeah, but I need to have a working dev env before messing with the front-end :P
[13:20:30] <XhmikosR> the biggest issue will be that data table plugin, not sure if it works with BS3
[13:21:09] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ah
[13:21:21] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, maybe some stuff doesn't need to be updated if it works okay ;)
[13:21:46] <XhmikosR> true but we'll hit an issue eventually if we just update one lib
[13:21:49] <XhmikosR> we'll see
[13:22:00] <XhmikosR> what I want to do is the switch to Bootstrap 3
[13:30:13] <XhmikosR> I think everything passes tests on Windows too, except for requirejs https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-requirejs/build/1/job/95nqi6m17xfbymww
[13:38:36] <XhmikosR> ah was just a line endings issue. Even on Windows, I get LF in that file. I'll change the text to split for `\n`
[13:39:33] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, nice
[13:39:40] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i saw travis also failed
[13:40:05] <XhmikosR> yeah because ^2.1.0 gets 2.2.0
[13:40:11] <XhmikosR> should be OK in master
[20:05:34] <vladikoff> shama, ping
[20:06:24] <shama> vladikoff: yo
[20:06:36] <shama> vladikoff: seems like a good day to release eh?
[20:06:47] <vladikoff> shama, lol
[20:07:48] <vladikoff> shama, I had 2 questions. 1: i don't think the bin thing is working https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/1491#issuecomment-199853495
[20:08:27] <vladikoff> shama, 2: not sure if you know nopt better, but there is a diff behaviour in v.3 https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli/issues/102
[20:08:27] <shama> vladikoff: I saw that and will take a look tonight. I wish I finished up those integration tests now :/
[21:35:25] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: any reason why in grunt's onw package.json we use specific versions for some deps?
[21:35:59] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yes, because stuff breaks left and right
[21:36:22] <XhmikosR> even for devDependencies?
[21:36:41] <XhmikosR> also we really need a new grunt-contrib-internal version after we add a switch for CI skip so that we can normalize stuff
[21:36:41] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yeah
[21:37:10] <XhmikosR> shelljs should be safe to update though
[21:37:38] <XhmikosR> and path-is-absolute if we reverse the logic
[21:37:48] <XhmikosR> I'll see if I can update some safely
[21:38:26] <XhmikosR> about https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-requirejs maybe we should have a new version. Not sure if it should be a patch one though
[21:38:50] <XhmikosR> time to sleep, ttyl
[21:47:12] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, thanks! ttyl!
[22:26:17] <shama> vladikoff: that behavior of nopt is expected and we should update back to 3.
[22:26:27] <vladikoff> shama, so updating noopt in grunt-cli is bad
[22:26:35] <shama> vladikoff: why?
[22:26:43] <shama> its 1.0.0, new apis
[22:26:45] <vladikoff> shama, because everyone is blindly installing `npm i -g grunt-cli` in their docker files
[22:27:41] <shama> vladikoff: There isn't anything we can do if someone isn't relying on versioning.
[22:27:45] <vladikoff> shama , solutions: 2 include old nopt and new nopt and detect which grunt it is running against
[22:28:03] <vladikoff> shama: solution 2: merge the cli into `grunt` and deprecate grunt-cli
[22:28:52] <shama> vladikoff: people cant change their docker file to `npm i -g grunt-cli@0.1.13`?
[22:29:02] <vladikoff> shama, they can
[22:30:21] <vladikoff> shama, when you install a cli do you expect it to work against any version?
[22:31:42] <shama> vladikoff: I dont follow. To me this just seems like new syntax. If you're using grunt-cli@1.0.0 you must use the new syntax.
[22:32:34] <vladikoff> shama, hmm
[22:32:59] <shama> vladikoff: which part breaks? that issue just had someone unaware of the new syntax
[22:34:57] <vladikoff> shama, sure
[22:38:14] <vladikoff> shama, basically no one does `npm i -g grunt-cli@0.1.13`
[22:38:18] <vladikoff> and that's a problem
[22:38:43] <shama> vladikoff: how do we make api changes then?
[22:38:49] <vladikoff> shama, no one thinks to version the global cli
[22:38:53] <shama> because nopt 1 is really broken
[22:39:23] <vladikoff> shama, remove the cli?
[22:39:32] <vladikoff> shama, put it into main grunt
[22:40:04] <shama> vladikoff: wouldnt that just move the problem? then people will blindly npm i -g grunt right?
[22:40:19] <vladikoff> shama, they should never `-g`
[22:40:20] <shama> and it will be difficult to make api changes
[22:40:29] <shama> they will have to if they want the grunt command
[22:41:16] <vladikoff> shama, man worked with npm scripts too much
[22:42:37] <vladikoff> shama, so in the docs we need to do something like: 1. install the cli`npm install -g grunt-cli` 2. check what version of grunt is in your project. if it is 0.4.5 then use --gruntfile path/Gruntfile.js' if the project uses 1.0.0 then use --gruntfile=..."
[22:42:53] <shama> vladikoff: I really dont see the problem here. There will be people who use "*" and their stuff breaks. The can solve their problem by versioning. I think if we trying to get creative with a solution, we'll end up causing bigger issues.
[22:43:49] <shama> You can do --gruntfile=path/Gruntfile.js in 0.4.5 too right?
[22:44:38] <vladikoff> shama , maybe but there could be other changes
[22:46:07] <shama> vladikoff: That's ok. We've got versions. If it breaks for someone, they can specify versions.
[22:46:19] <vladikoff> shama, but anyway sounds good, it's gonna break some builds but people need to understand the danger of global cli
[22:46:24] <shama> Otherwise, we'd never be able to make any changes right?
[22:46:25] <vladikoff> shama, so what do we do
[22:46:57] <vladikoff> shama, release 1.0.2 or 1.2 ?
[22:47:01] <vladikoff> of cli?
[22:47:52] <shama> vladikoff: Release 1.2.0 with latest nopt. Add some extra notes about this concern in the release notes and docs if needed.
[22:48:04] <shama> 1.1.0 I mean
[22:48:11] <vladikoff> shama, sounds good!
[22:48:25] <vladikoff> shama, what to do about grunt-cli in grunt, it's useless in there
[22:48:29] <shama> vladikoff: Sorry I wasnt quicker to look into that issue btw
[22:48:45] <shama> vladikoff: Lemme look into why this evening
[22:49:04] <vladikoff> shama, yeah no worries, i panicked and really didn't want to break people's builds
[22:49:19] <shama> vladikoff: You can send them at me. :)
[22:49:30] <shama> I dont mind steering people to better practices :)
[22:50:00] <vladikoff> shama, so what happens if you have 2 projects with grunt 0.4.5 and grunt 2.0.0
[22:50:10] <vladikoff> shama, do you keep switching the global cli?
[22:50:18] <vladikoff> shama, because things can change a lot
[22:51:36] <shama> vladikoff: Install locally. and we should explore that more when implementing: https://github.com/gruntjs/rfcs/pull/2
[22:53:07] <vladikoff> shama, in my head i do not see the future for the cli but it's fine for now
[22:53:18] <vladikoff> shama, how does `make` deal with this
[22:56:57] <shama> vladikoff: I think we just make grunt-cli as small as possible to minimize the need to change it often. It's a dev peer dep. We have the same issues with the version of npm.
[22:57:15] <vladikoff> shama, true
[22:57:42] <shama> But luckily we have options, where with npm and other deps like that, you're stuck with no options.
[22:57:43] <vladikoff> shama , i guess the only sane future i can think of is `.bin` gets installed and it creates a symlink`grunt` in the project root or whatever
[22:58:12] <vladikoff> shama, so you can just run `grunt` or `./grunt` from your project and never worry
[22:58:40] <shama> vladikoff: The problem is there can only be 1 grunt command on a system. It has to be a version.
[22:58:51] <shama> vladikoff: We would need to do that for every folder of the project :)
[22:59:14] <vladikoff> shama, well the idea is you only run grunt from the root of your project
[22:59:37] <vladikoff> shama, that symlink is basically a shortcut to `node_modules/.bin/grunt`
[23:00:45] <shama> idk, Im not too worried. grunt-cli is really just a dev convenience library. If you hit a hard issue with it on a project, just install locally and let npm script it.
[23:02:20] <shama> I'd worry about it if the user couldn't install it locally... like npm.
[23:03:10] <shama> That is what versions are for. Use the latest unless it breaks your stuff, then fallback to a previous version until you can adjust.
[23:08:54] <vladikoff> shama, ok sent out v1.1.0
[23:09:02] <shama> vladikoff: rad thank you!
[23:09:43] <vladikoff> shama, brb
[23:23:10] <shama> vladikoff: so whoa, people are squatting on azer's packages? I guess we should start diving into our deps and make sure we dont hit these bogus ones eh?
[23:25:42] <vladikoff> shama, it's wild west out there
[23:36:11] <vladikoff> shama, I almost got one of the repo
[23:36:33] <vladikoff> shama, packages* but decided against it later
[23:40:32] <shama> vladikoff: Im glad the node security team is all over it
