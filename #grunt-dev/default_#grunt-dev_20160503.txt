[14:13:28] <XhmikosR> shama vladikoff: should we add node 6 is travis in grunt-contrib-internal and make a new patch release?
[14:14:17] <shama> XhmikosR: +1 I haven't even tried 6 yet
[14:14:37] <XhmikosR> all right, I'll make a PR later and CC you
[14:14:57] <XhmikosR> shama: eventually, we should stop testing obsolete versions though
[14:15:12] <XhmikosR> I mean, 0.12 was never a production one
[14:21:28] <shama> XhmikosR: what do you mean?
[14:22:39] <XhmikosR> shama: there is no point in testing 0.12 anymore. If someone is using such version, they are looking for trouble. The LTS release is 4. 5 became 6 now and so on
[14:23:57] <shama> XhmikosR: Do you have stats on how many people are using 0.12? I remember seeing a tweet from seldo awhile back and it was significant
[14:24:33] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, and 0.10?
[14:24:38] <shama> I'm treating the node.js versions like browser versions... targeting the significant user bases.
[14:26:32] <shama> It looks like npm will be rolling that stat out more regularly soon: https://twitter.com/seldo/status/701529040042070016
[14:26:33] <b-ot> (shama) @seldo (Laurie Voss): @samccone we are working on a better system for analytics right now so I'll try and pull it out of that :-) (2 months and 11 days ago)
[14:26:38] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: 0.10 the same, but that was before node.js changed their version system. And since we support 0.10 as the minimum version, we should test it
[14:27:20] <XhmikosR> shama: I don't have any stats but like I said, 0.12 was never a stable version for a long time. It was just before they changed their versioning
[14:28:31] <shama> XhmikosR: I understand and am familiar. I think we should make the decision based on how many people are using a version.
[14:28:46] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, shama, i don't see any problems supporting 0.12
[14:28:51] <vladikoff> issues rarely come up
[14:28:55] <vladikoff> it's not like testing ie6 or w/e
[14:29:24] <XhmikosR> just check the numbers and we can make a better decision
[14:29:57] <XhmikosR> 0.10 is the minimum supported version. 4 the LTS, 5 becomes 6 but we should test both for some time
[14:30:40] <shama> Here are the stats from last year: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Misg1p6m8vKiLLeY_WerWPOgMAaa_tG8fCGaekMQ9MU/edit#gid=0
[14:31:24] <vladikoff> clearly node/v2.0.2-nightly2015051136cdc7c8ac es #1
[14:31:34] <shama> Testing on a version will help avoid a user hitting an issue. The more users on a given version, the bigger the chance.
[16:30:24] <steveoh> vladikoff: is the github pullrequest bot code online?
