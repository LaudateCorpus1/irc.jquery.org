[09:38:54] <vladikoff> hey XhmikosR !
[09:38:59] <vladikoff> looking at 1349
[09:39:05] <vladikoff> i mean https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/pulls
[09:41:23] <XhmikosR> hey man
[09:41:30] <XhmikosR> was looking to find you on irc all this time
[09:41:53] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: please publish grunt-contrib-internal to npm too
[09:42:30] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ok!
[09:42:35] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, done and done
[09:42:44] <XhmikosR> thanks
[09:42:50] <XhmikosR> about the remaining uglify PRs
[09:43:07] <XhmikosR> the verbose one makes sense to me. We are close to finally being consistent across the contrib plugins
[09:44:00] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , sounds good!
[09:44:15] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, those 3 will make it to 2.0.0 right?
[09:44:30] <XhmikosR> ok and you agree with using 2.0.0 for the next version due to screwIE option?
[09:44:38] <vladikoff> yes!
[09:45:09] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ok which one do you want first https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/pull/422 or https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/pull/416 ?
[09:45:15] <vladikoff> 416 needs a rebase
[09:45:26] <XhmikosR> yeah already doing it
[09:45:48] <vladikoff> woohoo
[09:47:01] <XhmikosR> I wonder vladikoff
[09:47:13] <vladikoff> yeah?
[09:47:18] <XhmikosR> maybe we should just use an es5 shim or something instead of lodash.assign
[09:47:31] <XhmikosR> I mean we only need assign for node < 4
[09:49:26] <XhmikosR> PRs rebased
[09:49:35] <XhmikosR> wait for CI just to be safe
[09:50:15] <XhmikosR> AppVeyor is faster than Travis now :P
[09:51:11] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yesss! they updated infrastructure
[09:51:23] <XhmikosR> I was bugging for months for this
[09:51:26] <XhmikosR> *them
[09:52:18] <XhmikosR> so vladikoff when CI is done, merge #422 first and then #416
[09:54:12] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, hm not sure shim vs lodash assign, trying to think of the benefits
[09:54:25] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, maybe switch to shim if we need more
[09:54:37] <vladikoff> more shim shim
[09:54:57] <XhmikosR> we only use assign nothing else
[09:55:11] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, so maybe adding the shim is too much as of now
[09:55:15] <vladikoff> we can just keep assign
[09:55:25] <XhmikosR> not sure oif lodash.assign is slimmer
[09:55:27] <XhmikosR> I guess it is
[09:55:45] <XhmikosR> I will try to reduce lodash from all contrib plugins
[09:55:57] <XhmikosR> makes no sense to me to have the extra dep if can skip it
[09:56:46] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , eh
[09:56:58] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, is the benefit the size of the download ?
[09:57:02] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, does it save a lot?
[09:57:15] <XhmikosR> it's the extra dep. The less the better IMO
[09:57:38] <XhmikosR> for example _.map -> Object.keys().map
[09:57:43] <XhmikosR> no big deal
[09:58:18] <XhmikosR> I'll do it on per plugin basis so we'll see how it goes
[09:59:31] <XhmikosR> for the uglify example, it's 1.3MB vs 43KB
[09:59:40] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, oh snap, that's interesting
[09:59:42] <XhmikosR> 900+ files vs 12 files
[09:59:49] <XhmikosR> I hate bloat
[10:03:02] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: what should I do with https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/tree/xmr-dev
[10:06:28] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, hm
[10:06:37] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I need you to merge https://github.com/vladikoff/marked/pull/2 so that tests pass for the website
[10:08:55] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i remember trying this out
[10:09:06] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, let me check something, sec
[10:09:10] <XhmikosR> sure
[10:09:57] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ah okay, seems like github does the same, merged
[10:10:29] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: ok let me rebase and check the branch status
[10:15:02] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: how about this https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/compare/warn-on-missing-input-files
[10:15:09] <XhmikosR> I have it for so long but never got a reply
[10:15:38] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, eh seems like no one wanted this
[10:15:47] <vladikoff> except that Scott person
[10:15:56] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, who else ?
[10:15:57] <XhmikosR> OK, I'll leave it as a branch then
[10:16:04] <XhmikosR> no idea
[10:16:08] <vladikoff> yeah
[10:16:13] <vladikoff> let's just leave it for now
[10:16:48] <XhmikosR> ok, should I tag and publish v2.0.0?
[10:16:58] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, if travis passes yap!
[10:17:03] <XhmikosR> cool
[10:18:33] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: do we care about IE < 9 for the website?
[10:18:42] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, nah
[10:19:09] <XhmikosR> ok, cause I have switched to SVG. It's time everyone moves on
[10:20:18] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/compare/master...0.4.1
[10:20:27] <XhmikosR> is that branch valid? if not can you remove it?
[10:20:43] <XhmikosR> my guess is that it's not but you know
[10:21:06] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , done!
[10:21:32] <XhmikosR> ok so we get 5 html errors for the website now
[10:23:46] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I still believe there's something wrong with the plugins generation
[10:24:03] <XhmikosR> I have 5,566 entries while on the live site 5,814 entries
[10:24:30] <vladikoff> mystery
[10:24:37] <XhmikosR> it's those failures
[10:24:42] <XhmikosR> but you closed the issue :p
[10:25:50] <XhmikosR> we need to make the site responsive, add a sitemap and switch to https. Who's in charge of the domain and server?
[10:29:32] <XhmikosR> one thing at a time
[10:30:12] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, "	we need to" , do we though?
[10:30:25] <XhmikosR> yep
[10:30:27] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, why
[10:30:31] <XhmikosR> SEO
[10:30:40] <XhmikosR> and actual mobile usage
[10:31:09] <XhmikosR> it's a shame to not follow modern standards for our own website :)
[10:31:10] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ehhh
[10:31:37] <XhmikosR> what I'd like first it https. Can you get me in touch with whoever manages the server?
[10:32:01] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, I manage the domain
[10:32:28] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: ok that means we can just use CloudFlare easily for a cheap https solution without changing anything on the server side
[10:33:13] <XhmikosR> jekyllrb.com, getbootstrap.com and million others use CF. I'm against it personally, but it's good at this point to get what we want and we revisit it later
[10:33:50] <XhmikosR> only issue with CF is that there isn;t any option to add other people to manage the site so you will have to do it
[10:34:25] <XhmikosR> although only the initial setup is needed
[10:42:01] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: so can you go through https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/commits/xmr-dev quickly and let me know what you think? Travis will fail due to those 5 html errors. I plan to look into it later
[10:44:20] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, can u send it as a PR?
[10:44:31] <XhmikosR> sure
[10:44:34] <vladikoff> yaaay
[10:47:19] <XhmikosR> uglify 2.0.0 published
[10:48:02] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , woohoo
[10:48:21] <vladikoff> pretty crazy to think that plugin is 4 years old now
[10:53:26] <XhmikosR> times flies
[10:53:44] <XhmikosR> and it's a shame the community left Grunt sort of die a few months ago
[10:57:21] <vladikoff> the damn community
[10:57:23] <vladikoff> jk jk
[10:57:27] <XhmikosR> hehe
[10:57:40] <XhmikosR> not sure if it's the head of the project too
[10:58:00] <XhmikosR> anyway, vladikoff please check if we can sort those html errors and we should be ready to merge the pr
[10:58:07] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ok great, thanks!
[10:58:56] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: https://gist.github.com/XhmikosR/966450cd0abddf426a3214cde9ffbffb
[11:00:12] <XhmikosR> or https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/builds/145847716
[11:07:33] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: you want 4,5,6 and iojs or something else?
[11:07:45] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, the side can just be node stable
[11:07:52] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, it's not a lib or anything
[11:07:54] <XhmikosR> ok so 4
[11:07:59] <XhmikosR> LTS
[11:09:18] <XhmikosR> vladikoff:
[11:09:18] <XhmikosR>   "engines": {
[11:09:19] <XhmikosR>     "node": ">=4.0",
[11:09:19] <XhmikosR>     "npm": ">=2.15"
[11:09:19] <XhmikosR>   },
[11:09:29] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yeap!
[11:16:06] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: hmm we should switch to pug since jade is the old one
[11:16:13] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, sure
[11:17:19] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: pr rebased. Any other comments?
[11:18:40] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, nope, are the html warnings blocking?
[11:18:56] <XhmikosR> sort of yes
[11:19:28] <XhmikosR> I guess we should use html for those headers so that we don't end up with duplicate IDs
[11:21:11] <XhmikosR> the branch ended up huge, sorry for that https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/pull/179/files?w=1
[11:22:02] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , ok!
[11:25:36] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: another thing we could do do is cache the plugins list in Travis
[11:27:13] <XhmikosR> hmm about the html errors
[11:27:35] <XhmikosR> I wonder if we could tweak our code and if the ID already exists to append `-number`
[11:27:38] <XhmikosR> or something
[11:28:48] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, works for me!
[11:29:07] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, can it be done from the gruntjs site code?
[11:30:25] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: it should be doable since we generate blog.html but I'm not very familiar with that code
[11:30:32] <vladikoff> ah
[11:30:48] <XhmikosR> or
[11:30:56] <XhmikosR> it's an upstream bug in marked
[11:31:08] <XhmikosR> I mean in the old version we use
[11:31:32] <XhmikosR> because it's a marked option to generate the anchors
[11:33:47] <XhmikosR> hmm that code seems to be your custom code vladikoff
[11:33:55] <XhmikosR> so we need to fix it in your marked fork
[11:35:07] <vladikoff> ah ok
[11:35:57] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: OR we could use anchor.js
[11:36:27] <XhmikosR> or another markdown converter, but I'm not familiar with any
[11:36:29] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, it's client side right?
[11:36:33] <XhmikosR> yeah
[11:36:45] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, don't wanna do that
[11:36:48] <XhmikosR> my main concern is that the IDs will probably change
[11:38:29] <XhmikosR> then I'm not aware of any other solution... if you think you can fix it in your marked fork please do so
[11:40:41] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, okay, sounds good!
[11:41:00] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: just don't let it stay there for years :)
[11:48:31] <XhmikosR> actually vladikoff
[11:48:38] <vladikoff> OH?
[11:48:46] <XhmikosR> grunt-brand-guide is unmaintained it seems
[11:49:05] <XhmikosR> how can we make marked render raw html?
[11:49:27] <XhmikosR> see how bad it looks now  http://gruntjs.com/docs/grunt-brand-guide.html
[11:49:41] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, hmm there was a way
[11:49:44] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i forgot :(
[11:49:56] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , that page is not linked anywhere
[11:50:19] <XhmikosR> I noticed that
[11:50:31] <XhmikosR> but it's good info IMO
[11:51:47] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yeap
[11:51:55] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , i think the html render was the blocker
[11:52:35] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: it seems more and more reasons to switch to a new renderer. I'm not sure I can make the switch myself though
[11:54:39] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I figured it
[11:54:44] <XhmikosR> you have `sanitize: true`
[11:55:22] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, neat!
[11:56:22] <XhmikosR> and ouch 53 errors now :p
[11:57:29] <vladikoff> rekt
[11:57:32] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: should we host those images we link to in grunt-brand-guide?
[11:57:45] <vladikoff> probably
[11:58:15] <XhmikosR> ok one thing at a time
[11:58:18] <XhmikosR> let me see the errors
[11:59:54] <XhmikosR> after that I'll need some help from you vladikoff to include the pages like the brand one in the site
[12:00:00] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, sounds good!
[12:04:20] <XhmikosR> 8 errors
[12:07:34] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: grunt-docs rc2 branch is obsolete?
[12:07:43] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, probably
[12:07:48] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yea
[12:08:11] <XhmikosR> please remove the obsolete branches :)
[12:13:07] <XhmikosR> vladikoff:
[12:13:13] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, true
[12:13:34] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: please check grunt-contrib-uglify hook for AppVeyor. Does it have PR there?
[12:13:47] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, you mean is it hooked up or wat
[12:13:51] <XhmikosR> yes
[12:13:57] <XhmikosR> prs don't trigger Appveyor
[12:14:07] <XhmikosR> and I'm trying to solve it with the AppVeyor guy
[12:14:16] <vladikoff> FEDOR!
[12:14:19] <XhmikosR> yeah
[12:14:27] <vladikoff> it's here https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify
[12:14:39] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: the GH settingas
[12:14:50] <XhmikosR> I don't have admin rights to check the settings
[12:14:58] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , "https://ci.appveyor.com/api/github/webhook  (push)"
[12:15:19] <XhmikosR> only that?
[12:15:22] <vladikoff> yeap
[12:16:08] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, same as in main `grunt` repo
[12:17:05] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: someone messed the permissions
[12:17:13] <vladikoff> :(
[12:17:32] <XhmikosR> was that you? :p
[12:18:11] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: please give me admin rights for uglify to solve this and I'll tell you what you need to do if we fix it
[12:19:16] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, done
[12:19:30] <XhmikosR> thanks, let me see
[12:20:51] <XhmikosR> vladikoff:
[12:21:03] <vladikoff> o
[12:21:24] <XhmikosR> someone (you) needs to go through all repos, settings/hooks appveyor, edit, choose Let me select individual events. and enable pull requests
[12:21:42] <XhmikosR> for uglify I just changed it
[12:22:08] <XhmikosR> basically, appveyor needs push and pull request events
[12:22:11] <XhmikosR> just those 2
[12:23:16] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, shiiiiiet
[12:24:03] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I know :/ I could do it if it's easy to add me as admin in all repos and then remove me after we are done
[12:24:15] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, it's ok, i ll fix it
[12:24:24] <XhmikosR> all right, thanks
[12:24:40] <XhmikosR> also remove me from uglify since I don't need admin anymore
[12:26:57] <XhmikosR> 6 errors
[12:33:10] <XhmikosR> 4 errors
[12:33:18] <vladikoff> 3 2 1 FIRE
[12:43:06] <XhmikosR> 1 which is in blog.html and I can't fix
[12:46:50] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , what's wrong with it
[12:47:00] <XhmikosR> ok I fixed it
[12:47:06] <XhmikosR> I disabled anchors for /blog/
[12:47:12] <vladikoff> :o
[12:47:17] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i need anchors
[12:47:24] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, i linked to them in a tweet
[12:47:35] <XhmikosR> yes
[12:47:38] <XhmikosR> you have them
[12:47:40] <vladikoff> :d
[12:47:43] <XhmikosR> just not in /blog/
[12:47:49] <vladikoff> >_<
[12:48:01] <vladikoff> anchors are hard
[12:50:15] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: please check the branch locally before merging just in case. And wait for CI
[12:50:35] <XhmikosR> we should cache the plugins list to speed travis but I can't do it now
[12:56:04] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: did you finish the appveyor hook changes?
[12:56:24] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, sorry i got work stuff right now, i put it on the list
[12:56:32] <XhmikosR> oh ok, no worries
[12:56:50] <XhmikosR> so, just look at the branch locally and merge it when you are done; it should pass now
[13:18:08] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, radical!
[13:21:20] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: let me check again the anchors thing
[13:38:50] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: ok I was right. My previous solution disabled anchors in all blog posts. I pushed the proper fix
[15:14:55] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: made a couple more cleanup, css this time
[15:15:04] <vladikoff> XhmikosRm yeap saw it !
[15:15:23] <XhmikosR> I wondered why the cursor didn't blink anymore
[15:15:34] <XhmikosR> with FF that I use at least
[15:15:38] <XhmikosR> now it works again
[15:37:12] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: I think we should simplify this
[15:37:13] <XhmikosR> var names = grunt.file.expand({cwd: base}, ['*', '!blog/**', '!grunt*.md', '!README.md', '!*.json', '!*.js']);
[15:37:26] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, oo
[15:37:35] <XhmikosR> var names = grunt.file.expand({cwd: base}, ['**/*.md', '!blog/**', '!grunt*.md', '!README.md']);
[15:37:46] <XhmikosR> or something similar
[15:38:02] <XhmikosR> I keep finding so many things along the way ;/
[15:41:40] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , D:
[15:45:13] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: hopefully this is the last rebase
[15:45:18] <XhmikosR> for today
[15:45:21] <vladikoff> :D
