[14:00:57] <vladikoff> shama, so gruntjs-updater is done
[14:01:07] <shama> done with PRs?
[14:01:08] <vladikoff> shama, updated around 3k plugins
[14:01:10] <vladikoff> shama, yah
[14:01:11] <shama> wow
[14:01:14] <shama> nice work!
[14:01:23] <vladikoff> shama , well sent PRs, but it is up to them to figure it out
[14:01:26] <shama> I got all mine updated and published too
[14:01:29] <shama> ya
[14:02:10] <shama> It's looking like we wont need to do a rc3. I think we just need to finish updating the grunt-contrib plugins, a few minor things and 1.0.0 is good to go.
[14:02:53] <vladikoff> shama, just rc2?
[14:03:52] <shama> there really isnt any bugs being reported. So either people are not trying out 1.0.0-rc1 or its stable
[14:04:38] <shama> But we can decide after releasing rc2
[14:04:57] <vladikoff> shama, ok
[14:06:10] <vladikoff> shama, did anyone make a module for in-memory file system? I Think there were a few
[14:06:55] <shama> yeah there is a bunch
[14:07:09] <shama> making a browser-grunt?
[14:07:20] <vladikoff> shama,
[14:07:59] <vladikoff> shama, I was just wondering why no one did `dest:  MEMORY_THING_HERE,`
[14:09:28] <shama> yeah memory targets would be cool
[14:09:58] <shama> *cough* https://github.com/gruntjs/rfcs *cough*
[14:11:26] <vladikoff> shama, yeah, i'm just surprised after all these years
[14:11:33] <vladikoff> shama, there is no memory pipe
[14:11:37] <vladikoff> shama, maybe it is impossible
[14:11:46] <vladikoff> or it sucks
[14:11:47] <shama> Or even just expose fs so people can override like we do in webpack
[14:11:48] <vladikoff> or STREAMS
[14:12:49] <shama> https://github.com/shama/webpack-stream/blob/master/index.js#L143 but i dunno
[14:13:36] <vladikoff> shama, yesss that's exactly
[14:13:42] <vladikoff> shama, what i had in mind
[14:14:14] <vladikoff> cool beans
[14:14:37] <shama> The only downside is when things get modular... I dont want Grunt to be a peer dep down the road. So if people start overriding fs, plugins won't get that override.
[14:14:51] <shama> Unless we got fancy
[14:15:50] <shama> ie: var grunt = require('grunt'); module.exports = grunt.createTask('mytask', function () { grunt.file.write(); });
[14:16:15] <vladikoff> shama, yeah registerTask needs to change in some way
[14:16:23] <shama> (I have an RFC coming down the tubes shortly for it)
