[11:48:48] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, so we talked a bit with shama about creating a 1.0-rc1 release
[11:49:13] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, where we basically bump some DEPS
[11:49:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah that sounds like a good idea
[11:51:00] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, shama, http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/66328132.jpg
[11:51:16] <vladikoff> (official branding ^ )
[11:52:01] <DaveMethvin> (chaos ensues)
[11:52:02] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, you wanna review that stuff or naah? what do you wanna do?
[11:52:29] <DaveMethvin> you guys know better than me what to do there, but i can help with publicizing it
[11:52:54] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, what jquery foundation stuff did you want to include / add/ change ?
[11:53:01] <DaveMethvin> maybe a blog entry describing why updating some deps justify a 1.0
[11:53:12] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[11:53:17] <DaveMethvin> i guess i can do that part now
[11:53:51] <DaveMethvin> what was your schedule for doing this?
[11:54:07] <DaveMethvin> although the rc1 could go ahead regardless
[11:54:14] <DaveMethvin> i'll just be changing comments and such
[11:57:27] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, ok we will schedule a google hangout with shama to deal with these things, let me know if you wanna join
[11:57:50] <DaveMethvin> sure
[11:57:55] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, not super important for you to be there, just wanna make sure you don't feel excluded from the process
[11:58:07] <DaveMethvin> i feel the love already!
[11:58:11] <vladikoff> lol
[11:58:43] <DaveMethvin> Got an email from JSAussieSkater just now so we may get some help there with docs
[13:58:40] <vladikoff> shama, DaveMethvin, I sent a thing that should help us schedule the meeting during our available times, hopefully it works out
[14:09:53] <vladikoff> DaveMethvin, shama, timezone is EST, not sure if it is showing it properly
[14:10:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i guessed it was so np
[16:44:15] <shama> vladikoff: thanks for setting that up! If its EST, all the times are super early for the PST but one was reasonable.
[16:47:27] <vladikoff> shama, darn yeah
