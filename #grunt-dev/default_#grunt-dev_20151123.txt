[22:34:13] <vladikoff> shama, i made a board here with some of the repos: https://waffle.io/gruntjs/grunt?source=gruntjs%2Fgrunt
[22:34:23] <shama> neato
[22:34:43] <vladikoff> shama, let me know if useful, things in "ready" are something to look at / fix up in my opinion
[22:35:30] <shama> So many things will get fixed by bumping deps and just saying Grunt 1.0.0
[22:35:42] <vladikoff> shama, some things might also break :D
[22:35:47] <shama> Ive just skimmed through the issues and a ton are related to outdated deps
[22:36:23] <shama> It will be minor though... its not like a 1.0.0 is changing up APIs
[22:36:29] <shama> that can be 2.0.0
[22:36:55] <shama> but ill let you all worry about that :)
[22:39:27] <vladikoff> loool
[23:18:58] <shama> vladikoff: are we following the style guide errors reported by jscs?
[23:19:18] <vladikoff> shama, maybe?
[23:19:23] <vladikoff> shama, there was a grunt preset
[23:20:56] <shama> hmm ok i'll fix anyways as they are super minor and I dont think Ben will mind
