[17:03:24] <vladikoff> shama, what was the module to find module's path
[17:03:45] <vladikoff> shama, (which makes it easier to find things now that npm3 can throw them whereever it wants)
[17:03:54] <shama> vladikoff: require.resolve()
[17:05:14] <shama> vladikoff: If this is related to loadNpmTasks(), that wont fix that issue very well. As it only knows how to require a single exported entry module. Where loadNpmTasks find a tasks/ folder and loads all the files in there.
[17:05:22] <vladikoff> shama, no it's something else
[17:06:19] <vladikoff> shama, ah right require resolve points to main
[17:06:26] <vladikoff> shama, i am looking for something that will find the module path
[17:06:30] <vladikoff> shama, without main
[17:07:12] <vladikoff> shama, sindre made like 10 of these that do resolving, just gotta find the right one lol
[17:07:40] <shama> vladikoff: hmm not sure. I guess one solution is require.resolve() and then findup from that basedir
