[09:33:58] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: can you add Travis for gruntjs.com? Only admins can. And check skip branches if they don't have .travis.yml
[09:34:18] <XhmikosR> perhaps we should limit the IRC bot to check only master branch too
[10:17:17] <XhmikosR> I fixed my branch build failure.
[10:24:37] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, enabled!
[10:25:53] <XhmikosR> cool, now we basically need to fix https://github.com/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/issues/171
[10:26:00] <XhmikosR> https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/gruntjs.com
[10:26:34] <XhmikosR> jshint fails, I know, it's eqnull which I believe we should enable and clean up that part, and one other valid error
[10:27:23] <XhmikosR> Running "downloadPlugins" task
[10:27:24] <XhmikosR> File already cached. Manually delete to redownload...
[10:27:31] <XhmikosR> how can it be cached on travis????
[10:28:07] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, wild!
[10:28:29] <XhmikosR> that code is broken I think
[10:28:37] <XhmikosR> anyway, how should I proceed with my branch?
[10:30:18] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, you can file a PR with what you have so we don't lose it. we are busy with the actual 1.0 release right now
[10:30:34] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, there are some funky issues, after that is stable we are gonna take a look at the site update
[10:30:47] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, I'm planning to fix the plugin list soon because we need it for the release
[10:30:56] <XhmikosR> but it doesn't work :P
[10:31:53] <XhmikosR> https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/gruntjs.com/jobs/117983776
[10:32:19] <XhmikosR> oh I see why it's cached
[10:32:25] <XhmikosR> because postinstall it runs grunt
[10:32:32] <XhmikosR> so it works on unix
[10:33:31] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, oh look the plugin fetch works fine actually
[10:33:38] <XhmikosR> yup
[10:33:48] <XhmikosR> but locally it fails for me
[10:34:38] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, are you on windows
[10:34:43] <XhmikosR> yeah
[10:34:50] <XhmikosR> that's why I say it works on unix
[10:34:58] <XhmikosR> since it works on Travis :)
[10:36:14] <XhmikosR> do we want to have `grunt` as postinstall?
[10:37:35] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, yea
[10:37:57] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, it makes deploying easier, do you HATE IT
[10:38:10] <XhmikosR> weird I don't see the target being run properly. grunt test has jshint in my branch yet on Travis jshint task doesn't run
[10:38:31] <XhmikosR> it's not a big deal, I just think one should explicitely run grunt
[10:38:46] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ah
[10:39:20] <XhmikosR> we'll see, I'll try to split some safe stuff and make PRs
[10:39:22] <XhmikosR> ttyl
[10:40:11] <vladikoff> XhmikosR , okay! Thanks!!
[13:07:27] <shama> vladikoff: hey! which part of the grunt-cli bin install wasn't working? I tried a bunch of different things last night and the node_modules/.bin/grunt worked for me
[13:08:48] <vladikoff> shama, huh
[13:09:09] <vladikoff> shama, rc1 put a bin into .bin?
[13:09:16] <vladikoff> shama, npm 2 ?
[13:09:37] <shama> vladikoff: I only tried with grunt-cli@1.1.0
[13:10:14] <vladikoff> hrmmm
[13:32:07] <XhmikosR> vladikoff: can't we upstream your marked changes?
[14:28:05] <vladikoff> shama, https://gist.github.com/vladikoff/716f590f4b36de4b6fa1
[14:28:27] <vladikoff> shama, i was hoping there would be a `grunt` in `node_modules/.bin`
[16:25:34] <XhmikosR> who's in charge of the domain? How about setting up CloudFlare?
[16:27:03] <vladikoff_> XhmikosR, me and Ben are
[16:27:16] <XhmikosR> cool
[16:27:36] <vladikoff_> XhmikosR, we are looking into it
[16:27:41] <XhmikosR> I suggested CloudFlare because it's free
[16:27:54] <XhmikosR> we can have SSL off if you (like me) don't like their flexible SSL
[16:27:55] <vladikoff_> XhmikosR, yeah jquery uses it already, we either make our account or use theirs
[16:28:14] <XhmikosR> https://gtmetrix.com/reports/gruntjs.com/Sxep9tKe
[16:28:29] <XhmikosR> just for reference, I'm gonna compare things as I make changes
[16:28:49] <XhmikosR> but I believe with CF we'll cut that to less than 1s
[16:29:04] <XhmikosR> vladikoff_: another thing, can you make sure the ads code is the latest one?
[16:29:17] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, sorry what do you mean
[16:29:21] <XhmikosR> I mean it still sets `border` so I assume it's pretty old
[16:30:18] <XhmikosR> whoever has access to that ad account, can they check if it's the latest one?
[16:30:33] <vladikoff> XhmikosR, ah yea no clue
[16:30:45] <vladikoff> shama, did you see my gist above ^
[16:36:10] <shama> vladikoff: yep thanks! I'll take a look
[23:05:20] <shama> vladikoff: Im going to create another library, grunt-known-options to share the known options between grunt and grunt-cli
[23:06:26] <vladikoff> shama, coool!
[23:06:40] <vladikoff> shama, do we need that for 1.0.0?
[23:07:48] <shama> vladikoff: yeah if we get backwards compat and can use the latest version of nopt, seems good. I didnt know about that behavior in nopt
