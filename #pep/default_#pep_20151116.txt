[01:35:46] <bethge> scott_gonzalez: iiuc we alter the MouseEvent which triggers the PointerEvent. If the buttons property is missing on the MouseEvent, we add it.
[01:58:30] <bethge> From the perspective of a user of PEP, I wouldn't expect any changes to MouseEvent properties.
[02:00:10] <bethge> If you have an osx safari at hand, I have a fiddle for it: http://jsbin.com/focudi/6/
[09:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: Ah, I see what you mean.
[09:36:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why `inEvent` is modified in there, since that's not the event we're dispatching.
[10:52:46] <bethge> scott_gonzalez: I don't think we are using it at a later point. Should I go ahead and create an issue?
[10:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it looks safe to remove.
