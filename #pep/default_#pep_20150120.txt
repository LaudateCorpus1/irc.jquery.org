[11:20:18] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i didn’t put in times before because i knew none of my availability would match up with others’ availability based on the first few responses, but i put it in anyway
[11:20:24] <snover> i will just need to get with people async i guess
[11:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks snover. At least having people respond shows us who definitely can't make certain times.
