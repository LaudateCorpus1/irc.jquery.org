[10:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> snover arschmitz: obj['delete'] vs. obj.delete
[10:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> The latter is safe based on our environment support, right?
[10:47:35] <snover> second one since i am still a proponent of not supporting es3 :)
[10:48:00] <snover> the latter works only in es5+
[10:48:35] <scott_gonzalez> Right. I know we talked about potential IE8 support via es5shim.
[10:48:41] <arschmitz> yup
[10:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> But if we get to that point before IE8 is officially dropped, we can just change to quotes.
[10:49:09] <arschmitz> yeah id go second
[10:49:20] <arschmitz> and if we get there then worry about it
[10:50:11] <arschmitz> i mean we have a long ways to go before we have the jquery version up and running again
[10:50:50] <arschmitz> and with out that es3 vs es5 is a moot point anyway
[10:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> single quotes or double quotes?
[10:55:13] <arschmitz> double
[10:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery style guide is double, but all the existing code in PEP is single.
[10:56:01] <arschmitz> to avoid extra exceptions and personal preference double
[10:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Any objection on double quotes?
[10:57:03] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i prefer singles because shift key, but i donâ€™t really care either way, one is not more readable than the other
[10:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> CONTENTION!
[10:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[10:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure jscs won't automatically convert for us, so I may leave that out for now.
[10:58:08] <snover> iâ€™m just saying like
[10:58:14] <arschmitz> just find and replace and then see if anything breaks lol
[10:58:28] <snover> if i spill coffee into my keyboard directly over both shift keys and everything else works except for the shift keys i wonâ€™t be able to write strings any more
[10:58:36] <arschmitz> lol
[10:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> snover: That's what copy and paste is for.
[10:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> Or macros...
[10:58:55] <arschmitz> snover: lets be fair i doubt your lap top will work at all in that case wither
[10:59:19] <snover> i just said everything else works, arschmitz!
[10:59:20] <arschmitz> double coffee spill into keyboard does not generally boad well lol
[10:59:20] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you want to update all the strings?
[10:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> If not, my vote is for single quotes.
[10:59:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: sure
[10:59:38] <snover> itâ€™s my magic delusion.
[10:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll leave that for you.
[10:59:48] <arschmitz> thats fine
[12:13:50] <pep-commit> [PEP] scottgonzalez opened pull request #185: Style guide (master...style-guide) http://git.io/vJTdo
[12:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> snover: You're killing me.
[12:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> So array indices get spaces, object properties don't?
[12:55:18] <snover> murder is fun
[12:56:59] <snover> object/array literals vs accessors, the whitespace for literals is actually partially to visually differentiate them from accessors. contrived example, foo[[ a ][0]]
[12:58:20] <snover> iâ€™ll be back later
[12:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> That seems bonkers to me.
