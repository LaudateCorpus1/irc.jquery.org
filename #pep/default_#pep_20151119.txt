[09:37:23] <bethge> yes, sure
[09:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so first a few basic things that you may already know.
[09:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> This channel and #jquery-meeting are publicly logged, so if you ever need to go back and don't have the messages locally, you can find them on http://irc.jquery.org/.
[09:39:01] <scott_gonzalez> And you can find the meeting notes on http://meetings.jquery.org/category/pep/.
[09:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> Now that you have write access to the repo, you should read through http://contribute.jquery.org/repo-maintainers-guide/
[09:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> Also, read through our Code of Conduct: https://jquery.org/conduct/
[09:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, if you ever have any questions about this stuff, feel free to ask me.
