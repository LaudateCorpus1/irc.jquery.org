[06:42:49] <pep-commit> PEP/master 5ea235f Scott Gonz√°lez: Build: Updating the master version to 0.3.1-pre.
[07:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pep/tree/gh-pages
[07:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> I ported the samples and removed the shadow DOM sample.
[07:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on what should be in the README, if anything?
[07:19:04] <arschmitz> maybe just a link to the proper branch for the code
[07:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> Also, should index.html just be a plain list of links or do we want to write some text and/or apply some styling?
[07:19:25] <arschmitz> I think we should make it an actual page but not important today
[07:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to send a PR to have the discussion, but since it's an orphaned branch, I can't :-/
[07:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> So just a plain list of links for now?
[07:19:54] <arschmitz> Yeah unless you feel like spending some time on it lol
[07:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> With a link to the project page.
[07:20:16] <arschmitz> yeah that makes sense for today
[07:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, check that branch now.
[07:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: ^
[07:30:24] <arschmitz> yeah sorry looks good
[07:30:35] <arschmitz> had to restart computer
[07:31:06] <arschmitz> heh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottgonzalez/PEP/gh-pages/spaceship/index.html
[07:31:19] <arschmitz> Modified to use pointer.js by Boris Smus. For more information, see
[07:31:19] <arschmitz> https://github.com/borismus/pointer.js.
[07:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> Meh. We should do a clean up of all of these.
[07:31:56] <arschmitz> yup
[07:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll land this.

[10:34:03] <arthurvr> nice work :)
[10:37:31] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: needs a tweet as well
[10:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> arthurvr: Yup, I pinged ajpiano but I don't think he's around.
[10:38:55] <arthurvr> okay thanks Scott
[10:39:04] <arschmitz> i just re-tweeted from mobile account at least
[10:40:21] <arthurvr> Aurelio‚Äôs post never was posted as well
[10:52:38] <arthurvr> aren‚Äôt there ways to automate tweets from wordpress posts by the way?
[14:22:48] <M4rius> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[14:33:24] <M4rius> I do have some follow up questions on the issue "Suppress over/out/enter/leave during capture #177". tbh I am not fully certain what I am looking for. As you mention, boundary events trigger when a pointer (lets say the mouse) enters a capturing element. pointerout and pointerover furthermore bubble. "Boundary events from other elements should be suppressed", what kind of other elements are meant? Wouldn't retargetting of these elements lead to events being
[14:33:25] <M4rius> triggered multiple times?
[14:34:50] <M4rius> s/retargetting of these elements/retargetting of these events/
[14:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius: When you capture to an element, you still get over and out when you cross the boundary of that element.
[14:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> But when you cross the boundary of other elements, you should not get any over/out events.
[14:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> So think about a page with a div on the left of the screen and a div on the right of the screen.
[14:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> If you press down on the left div, capture to that element, then move across to the right div...
[14:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> You should get an out event when you cross the boundary of the left div, which we're capturing to.
[14:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> But you should not get an over event when you cross the boundary of the right div.
[14:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> The native mouse events will still be triggered since mouse doesn't have the concept of capturing.
[14:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> So we need to not promote the over/out events on the right div to pointer events.
[14:48:50] <M4rius> Aah ok
[14:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> We still get over/out for the capturing element so that you can do things like making a button that has proper active styling as you cross the boundary.
[14:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta take my son to t-ball, but if you have more questions, just ask and I'll respond when I get back.
[14:50:16] <M4rius> ok sure, thanks. it already clears up a lot
