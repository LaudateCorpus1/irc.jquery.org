[09:46:40] <bethge> Hey there. About the scrolling behaviour for touch events. Sometimes pan-x and pan-y works, sometimes it doesn't. Did anyone experience this as well? I believe this is the relevant code: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/blob/master/src/touch.js#L196-L224
[11:11:05] <bethge> Ah, I tricked myself with a break point. The behaviour is consistent. It is rather a best effort approach. I was looking into it for supporting touch-action and passive event listeners.
[11:11:51] <bethge> From what I can tell, passive event listeners only make sense, if we have native touch-action support.
[11:15:27] <bethge> If both are supported, I believe we can actually skip the whole installer and take the path of HAS_TOUCH_ACTION_DELAY.
[11:16:19] <bethge> -> HAS_TOUCH_ACTION_DELAY.
[11:16:37] <bethge> Sry, I meant: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/blob/master/src/touch.js#L32-L38
[11:26:36] <bethge> If only touch-action is supported, we would need the installer to only attach touch listeners on the relevant elements, but we could write the attributes as css rules and thereby gain proper x-pan and y-pan.
