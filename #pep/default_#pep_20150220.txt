[06:14:53] <jperrault> gm all.  just pushed an update to PR #153 based on yesterday's comments.
[06:15:27] <jperrault> sorry, PR #164.
[11:44:13] <jperrault> snover: is it possible to reference an npm package from the define[] block that exists outside of the Itern npm package?
[11:45:31] <jperrault> chai-spies isn't part of Intern.  I've installed it via npm, but can't seem to get Intern to load it via the define[] block.
[11:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: The same way you're loading PEP, which is not part of Intern.
[11:49:19] <jperrault> one would think so.  but it seems to special-case stuff in the node-modules directory.
[11:50:15] <jperrault> I'll hack at it until I get the syntax right.
[11:52:43] <jperrault> bah.  I have npm on the brain, and was pointing it at npm_modules instead of node_modules.
[12:58:43] <jperrault> intern does not like hyphens in the name of modules
[13:00:18] <jperrault> nm.
[13:09:19] <jperrault> I don't think that the chai-spies module is playing nice with Intern's wrapped version of chai.
[13:10:03] <jperrault> I've included chai-spies as so: 'node_modules/chai-spies/chai-spies'
[13:11:27] <jperrault> intern does not like the hyphen in "function (chai-spies) { "
[13:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: That's not Intern, that's JavaScript
[13:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> You're substracing `spies` from `chai`.
[13:23:29] <jperrault> right, so I just called it something else.
