[11:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. I'm just getting to PEP stuff.
[11:39:55] <pep-commit> [PEP] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vWp84
[11:39:55] <pep-commit> PEP/master 6a9c6f0 JoÌˆrn Zaefferer: Package: Explicitly list files to include when publishing...
[11:40:18] <jzaefferer> That should be good to land as well: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/221
[11:40:45] <pep-commit> [PEP] jzaefferer closed pull request #221: README: Add example for using PEP with jQuery (master...jquery-example) http://git.io/vnoLN
[11:40:58] <jzaefferer> Would be nice to land a modification to a source file, to see if the Jenkins job works
[11:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> We can fix https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/225 right now.
[11:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> done
[11:44:20] <pep-commit> [PEP] scottgonzalez closed issue #225: Chrome warns about deprecated Touch.webkit... properties http://git.io/vcWGE
[11:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The new builds aren't showing up.
[11:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> As in, the commits I just pushed didn't trigger builds in Jenkins.
[11:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub shows that it sent the webhook.

[13:20:05] <bethge> Hi there - (back from the dead). Just catching up. About: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/195 : I will throw the changes to wpt out. And follow jzaefferer's adivce to creating a constant for the lookup.
[13:20:41] <bethge> Should I create a PR over at wpt for the wpt changes?
[13:38:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I updated the Jenkins job to use uppercase PEP. I suspect the casing prevented the webhook to trigger a build.
[13:39:31] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: Yup, send a PR to WPT and we'll get it merged in.
[13:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> Then we'll pull that update back into PEP.
[13:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Ok, I can resend the last webhook.
[13:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, but you already kicked off another build.
[13:40:29] <jzaefferer> the purge call was wrong, fixed that
[13:40:33] <jzaefferer> do it anyway
[13:40:55] <jzaefferer> I have the page open, redelivering..
[13:41:33] <jzaefferer> that might not do anything, since nothing changed...
[13:41:44] <jzaefferer> should've done that in the first place
[13:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> I redelivered an old payload.
[13:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't seem to do anything either.
[13:43:14] <jzaefferer> bethge: as Scott said, yes please. Thanks for your help!
[13:44:22] <bethge> Ok great, glad to help :)
