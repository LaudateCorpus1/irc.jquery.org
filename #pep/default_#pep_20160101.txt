[05:56:31] <bethge> Happy new Year! I noticed on mdn that FF has withdrawn "enabling pointer events in Nightly build": https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1166347#c76 What does that mean? FF does support PE, but it is not enabled in Nightly? Is that it? I am confused.
[08:54:16] <bethge> I am realizing that I must have set the PointerEvents-flag in about:config months ago, forgetting at some point, that it is actually _off_ by default. Disregard above ;)
