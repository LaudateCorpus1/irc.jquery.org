[08:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Down to just https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/233 for your open PRs.
[08:32:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:34:23] <jzaefferer> just rebased that branch, now it contains just the one commit
[08:35:20] <jzaefferer> Travis build still fails, I guess those failures are actually due to https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/192
[08:35:58] <jzaefferer> Missing ms property on IE11, missing requestAnimationFrame on IE9
[08:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the tests are just bad.
[08:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't IE11 have native unprefixed?
