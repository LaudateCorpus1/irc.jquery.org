[11:51:11] <bethge> Hi
[11:52:46] <scott_gonzalez> I know you've been working on test updates, do you have stuff to discuss for today's meeting?
[11:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> If you do, we'll have the meeting, but if not, we can skip this week.
[11:53:10] <bethge> Yeah, lets skip this week
[11:53:34] <bethge> I will look into getting a PR ready before next weeks meeting
[11:53:45] <bethge> (putting pressure on myself to keep working on it)
[11:53:47] <bethge> :-)
[11:55:30] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[11:55:30] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
