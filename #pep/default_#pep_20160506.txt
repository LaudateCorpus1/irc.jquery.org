[09:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: Yesterday, when I said that tracking buttons would only work for mouse...
[09:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's not something we have to worry about for tough, right?
[09:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> So it doesn't matter if we have a solution only for mouse.

[09:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> So I think my comment there is still valid.
[12:53:48] <bethge> scott_gonzalez: I would think touch would be ok. I wonder if we should fire a `pointerup`, if there has been no `mouseup`. Would a left click trigger a missing `pointerup` for the right button?
[12:56:10] <bethge> Essentially, from what I understand in Safari we have no way of ever finding out if a mouseup occured outside of the window for a mouse button. In any other browser we can just check the `buttons` property.
[12:58:05] <bethge> Nevermind, we do have a way, we can check `which` to see which button is currently being pressed outside of a `mousedown` event. But `which` does not appear to work for chorded buttons.
[13:02:38] <bethge> I guess what I am saying is: If we drop chorded mouse interactions for Safari, we would never have a broken buttons state.
[13:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> A left click wouldn't trigger `pointerup` for the right button if we used a flag. At least, I don't think it would.
[13:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's been a while since I've tested what happens with chorded mouse buttons, but I seem to remember that browsers don't handle it the way I expected.
[13:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> I think lack of chorded mouse buttons in Safari would be ok.
[13:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> I honestly can't think of a single site that uses chorded mouse buttons.
