[09:22:12] <jperrault> snover: what do I need to do to get an existing chai-based test to run inside of intern?  Is it a matter of simply wrapping it, or (as it seems) some amount of re-writing the tests?
[09:22:52] <snover> you should not need to rewrite the test, just expose the chai api that it uses
[09:22:57] <snover> can you show me the test?
[09:24:04] <jperrault> if you have PEP cloned, take test/loader.js for example.
[09:25:28] <jperrault> I thought the default loader config for intern already exposed the chai api.
