[08:59:38] <jperrault> snover: did you get a chance to look at test/loader.js?
[09:08:09] <snover> no, i didnâ€™t see a message to do that, where is it?
[09:09:39] <jperrault> I'm trying to integrate the PEP chai-based tests, but I can't figure out how to wrap them.  All the tests are in the /test directory.
[09:10:18] <snover> ok, i am in a meeting, i will look when i have finished in an hour or two
[09:10:37] <jperrault> k.  i went through the intern tutorial and have that working, just haven't been able to make the next leap.
