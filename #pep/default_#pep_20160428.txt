[12:10:34] <bethge_> Sorry, totally lost track of time. Are we meeting today?
[12:15:34] <arschmitz> me too
[12:15:36] <arschmitz> here now though
[12:16:45] <bethge_> Ok cool
[12:17:54] <bethge_> Should we head to the meeting room, or just stay here?
[12:22:49] <arschmitz> lets just stay here if its just us
[12:26:52] <bethge_> Alrighty, I can report that I made some progress towards https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/275 and partially https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/279
[12:27:17] <arschmitz> nice
[12:30:14] <arschmitz> is the grunt task to launch selenium working well for you no issues?
[12:31:05] <bethge_> I used to get some issue, that it didn't quit properly, I had to remove node_modules and now it works like a charm :)
[12:34:15] <bethge_> With fixing, #275 we should also be able to add three more w3c tests
[12:37:19] <bethge_> I feel like taking some steps towards automating the w3c tests for touch would be nice, though I have no idea what a local setup for this would look like.
[12:38:09] <bethge_> Is there some equivalent to chromedriver for running touch-based functional tests?
[14:07:09] <arschmitz> @be
[14:07:41] <arschmitz> bethge: there are mobile drivers for webdriver but im not sure how well they work last i tried they were buggy
[14:10:13] <arschmitz> bethge: looks like you can enable mobile emulation mode
[14:10:20] <arschmitz> and output touch events in chrome desktop too
[14:10:37] <bethge_> Uuh, that sounds good
[14:11:32] <arschmitz> so we would have to run the suite twice
[14:11:38] <arschmitz> once with emulation on for touch
[14:11:43] <arschmitz> and once off for mouse
[14:11:56] <arschmitz> which seems fine to me
[14:12:27] <arschmitz> its same as dev tools
[14:12:37] <arschmitz> where it will just make the mouse events into touches
[14:12:44] <bethge> Ah ok, I was about to ask that.
[14:12:53] <bethge> Is that "good enough" ?
[14:13:05] <arschmitz> its better then nothing
[14:13:14] <bethge> that is true :)
[14:13:18] <arschmitz> we can try and see if it causes issues at least
[14:13:51] <bethge> Good idea
[14:15:20] <bethge> Is this the mobile emulation? https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/mobile-emulation
[18:43:46] <arschmitz> bethge: sorry missed your reply yes thats it
[18:44:04] <arschmitz> of course they dont give you the JS api lol
