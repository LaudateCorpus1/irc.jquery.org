[08:01:00] <bethge> @scott_gonzalez: Thank you for adding the missing test files. About pointerevent_styles and pointerevent_support, are those actually tests? I thought they are just helpers for the test suite.
[18:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: Oh, I didn't even look at them. But now that you mention it, it does sound right. Let me check.
[18:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I didn't even look at the file extensions.
[18:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
