[10:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: I've been playing catch up since I got back. Haven't gotten to any PEP stuff yet.
[10:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be going over the PRs and issues this week though, so unless you have stuff you want to discuss, I'd say let's just wait one more week before we start our meetings again.
[10:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> That way I'll be caught up on what has happened.
[12:01:31] <bethge> yeah, sounds good!
[12:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok
