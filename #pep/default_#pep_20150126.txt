[16:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Is Wendesday at 10a ET a really bad time for you for meetings?
[16:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> Or is it something that you could make work?
[17:02:43] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i have a standing weekly meeting at that time
[17:02:48] <snover> oh no wait
[17:02:51] <snover> 10am ET
[17:02:57] <snover> i am not awake
[17:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[17:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's a shame. Looks like that's the best time for our meetings.
