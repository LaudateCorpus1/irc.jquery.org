[05:14:27] <bethge> Wording question: Is PEP a polyfill for Pointer Events or for pointer events? The w3c spec seems to use the two variations interchangably and so do we. The Touch Events Specification always uses touch events, when not talking about the Touch Events Specification or the Touch Events Recommendation etc.
[06:07:38] <bethge> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn433244(v=vs.85).aspx goes with "pointer event" (lowercase) when not referening to some particular document. To me (as a non-native speaker) the following would make sense: "The Pointer Events Polyfill (PEP) polyfills pointer events. The behaviour of pointer events is defined in the Pointer Events Specification."

[09:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: That sentence is correct.
[09:18:17] <bethge> Ok great, I would go ahead and create a PR to update our readme.md
[09:19:58] <bethge> Possibly over at the Pointer Events spec as well? Or am just being nitpicky?
[09:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> You can.
