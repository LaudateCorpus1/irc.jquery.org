[07:56:47] <arthurvr> not that guy, again
[08:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh. I actually just want to do the same thing to this issue.
[08:07:00] <arthurvr> Why not Iâ€™d say
[08:09:22] <scott_gonzalez> And done.

[08:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously not interested in contributing in a reasonable way.
[08:09:57] <arthurvr> haha, not at all.
[08:10:05] <arthurvr> he has been trolling out other repos as well :/

[08:13:35] <pep-commit> [PEP] supergray opened issue #179: yes he did it once again  http://git.io/veC5I
[08:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy.
[08:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I've reported him for abuse.
[08:19:27] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: maybe block him as well? Seems like heâ€™s not planning to stop
[08:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> Blocking just stops me from getting emails.
[08:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't block him from posting across the org.
[08:19:59] <arthurvr> canâ€™t you block people as an org?
[08:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> Not that I know of.
[08:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> As far as I know, the only way to block someone is to go to their profile page.
[08:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> And when you choose to block them it just blocks on behalf of the currently logged in user.
