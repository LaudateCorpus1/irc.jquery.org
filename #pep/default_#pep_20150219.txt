[07:58:52] <jperrault> So, I am still unable to get the tests to access PointerMap, dispatcher, Installer or targetFinding.  Can someone post a gist for test/loader.js where that happens?
[08:18:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ^^ your probably the most familiar with that right now
[08:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/blob/master/test/loader.js#L6
[08:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> When you load via AMD, that property will not exist on the window, it will be whatever you're importing.
[08:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> They're exposed here: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/blob/master/pointerevents.js#L14
[08:30:56] <jperrault> my intern define loads PEP.js: define([ 'intern!tdd',     'intern/chai!expect',     '../dist/PEP'    ],
[08:31:41] <jperrault> I can't load pointerevens.js, because the browser throws "modules are not implemented yet"
[08:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> ../dist/PEP is the correct file to load.
[08:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> That's the generated file that has the exports.
[08:41:44] <snover> where is the form/branch holding the tests?
[08:41:45] <snover> fork*
[08:45:34] <jperrault> my intern branch is here: https://github.com/JacquesPerrault/PEP/tree/use-intern-for-testing2
[08:46:27] <jperrault> the only changes are the addition of the intern.js config file, and the wrapper for the first test (loader.js)
[08:47:18] <jperrault> It was more extensive prior to the ES6 patch, but I backed a lot of it out after the merge.
[09:01:10] <scott_gonzalez> Meeting time. Everyone join #jquery-meeting.
[09:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> snover: What do we need to do in terms of CI testing?
[09:19:35] <snover> still working on an updated user guide, but probably https://theintern.github.io/intern/#ci-travis
[09:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: That hash gets rewritten, so the linking doesn't work.
[09:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'll set that up once the PR lands.
[09:22:54] <snover> hm. broken in chrome, works in firefox, i know why, i will fix it
[09:22:58] <snover> thanks for the heads up
[09:23:03] <snover> ALSO NOW I KNOW WHAT BROWSER YOU USE
[09:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> STOP SPYING ON ME.
[09:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> But *which* chrome? Didn't PPK inform you that there are like 30 of them? :-P
[09:39:03] <snover> i assume the best one.
[09:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> You are correct.
[09:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> The one that Google sneakily installs on my laptop every now and then.
[09:40:59] <snover> the hash links should be fixed in chrome now
[09:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's working for me.
[09:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:20:44] <jperrault> so I've made several pushes to my intern branch today, each with comments, some useful, some not.  Is there a way to mash all of those together into a single "initial intern integration" comment before generating a PR?
[12:21:26] <jperrault> or does it matter?  I'm just trying to keep the PR clean.
[12:22:11] <snover> yes. git rebase -i
[12:23:02] <snover> then force push to replace your old branch with the newly rebased one
[12:25:17] <jperrault> thanks
[13:23:37] <jperrault> ok, the branch is here: https://github.com/JacquesPerrault/PEP/tree/use-intern-for-testing2
[13:24:38] <jperrault> anyone want to review it before the PR?  There are some strange errors being thrown in the dispatcher test that I can't nail down.
[13:25:12] <jperrault> essentially, it says expect isn't defined, but the tests are still resolving correctly, which doesn't make sense.
[13:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Just send the PR, it makes it easier to review. That's what the PR is for.
[13:30:35] <jperrault> kk
[13:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I don't trust the test framework. That's something I'd like to address once this lands.
[13:38:20] <pep-commit> [PEP] JacquesPerrault opened pull request #164: Use intern for testing2 (master...use-intern-for-testing2) http://git.io/A34V
[14:38:19] <jperrault> colin, with a define of define([ ...,   'intern/chai!', ... ] can I do this: var cb = chai.spy;  ?
[14:52:56] <snover> jperrault: you could if you also included and activated the chai-spies plugin
[14:57:40] <jperrault> "chai-spies": "^0.5.1" is already listed as a dependency...is there a seperate plugin for intern, or is the existing dependency sufficient?
[15:01:52] <snover> youâ€™ll have to try it and see, i donâ€™t know exactly how that plugin is packaged. is something using it?
[15:04:21] <jperrault> yeah, in dispatcher
[16:14:43] <jperrault> Should the () be omitted in this line?  I'm seeing errors that "callback() is not a function" otherwise...   https://github.com/JacquesPerrault/PEP/blob/use-intern-for-testing2/test/setup.js#L64
[17:23:47] <snover> no, it should not be omitted.
