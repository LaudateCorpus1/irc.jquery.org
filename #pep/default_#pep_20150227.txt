[08:47:10] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: i noticed that altough setup.js is included in the original chai setup, it does not contain any actual tests, so I belive I incorrectly included it in the list of intern non-functional tests.  I have removed it from that list, and instead added it to the define[] list in capture.js, which is the only suite that leverages setup.js
[08:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that sounds right.
[12:24:59] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: which folder should I place the new interface.js into?  It probably belongs as a part of intern, but that's colin's domain.  I can put it in "test" for now...
[12:25:44] <snover> http://theintern.github.io/intern/#directory-structure
[12:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> We should move the actual test to /test/unit/
[12:26:48] <jperrault> capture.js?
[12:27:49] <scott_gonzalez> All of them.
[12:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> See the directory structure that snover linked to.
[12:28:27] <jperrault> was just looking at that.
[12:29:14] <jperrault> also, the test directory is called 'test', which I think is a carryover from pointerevents....did we want to make it plural?
[12:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't matter to me. That's really just preference.
[12:29:45] <jperrault> i'll leave it then
[12:43:30] <jperrault> snover: can "mocha": "*",     "chai": "^1.9.1", be removed from package.json now that we are moving to intern?
[12:43:59] <snover> yes
[12:44:05] <jperrault> yay!
