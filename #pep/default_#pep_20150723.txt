[09:02:57] <jdalton> zup
[09:17:09] <arschmitz> Oh i forgot scott is in india
[09:17:24] <arschmitz> if any one has anything to talk about i can open the room up and do the meeting
[09:18:09] <arschmitz> other wise might be better to wait for when scott is back next week
[09:24:24] <jdalton> ah ok
[09:24:32] <jdalton> I have added some tests in PRs
[09:24:57] <jdalton> based on advice from last meeting I'm pushing a little at a time instead of one big test payload
[09:25:23] <arschmitz> i saw you added some yeah i think thats going to be easier to review and handle
[09:28:22] <jdalton> rock
