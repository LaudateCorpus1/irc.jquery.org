[09:47:42] <jperrault> I haven't received any more comments on PR 164...is there anything preventing it from merge?
[09:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: That could just mean nobody has had a chance to review it again.
[09:57:01] <jperrault> np.  I added a comment after my last push, 'cause I know a new push doen't trigger any notifications.
[13:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> snover: So you answered two questions about Intern, but there's a third question :-)
[13:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> Why was the done callback not provided?
[13:31:56] <snover> dang it.
[13:32:17] <snover> thatâ€™s not how async works in intern
[13:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> Are the tests supposed to returna  promise?
[13:32:53] <snover> yes
[13:33:00] <snover> https://theintern.github.io/intern/#async-tests
[13:33:42] <snover> of course if you are making a custom interface you could do whatever you want
[13:33:50] <snover> pass a done function into test function? sure
[13:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well let's go with that for now, so we can get this landed ASAP.
[13:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'll comment on the PR.
