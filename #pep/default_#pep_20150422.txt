[01:20:53] <nod_> scott_gonzalez: quick ping, any point in looking at using pep for all things drupal? We already ran into mouse/touch issues in a few places.
[01:21:47] <nod_> scott_gonzalez: or should we wait a bit until things get clearer?
[05:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> nod_: We plan to move all of jQuery UI over, so I'd say go for it.
[05:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> It should be stable enough for you to start testing out moving over, and given the lengthy drupal release schedules, we should be able to fix bugs before the next code freeze.
[05:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> Is the current release schedule posted anywhere?
[08:59:00] <nod_> scott_gonzalez: no, we don't know when 8.0.0 will get out
[08:59:25] <nod_> scott_gonzalez: but good to know, we have jquery ui so we'll get it at some point then :p)
