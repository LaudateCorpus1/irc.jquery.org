[03:24:06] <bethge> I have been meaning to make so head way on the mobile tests, so ... shouldn't the mobile oriented test w3c tests have `touch-action: none` on `#target0` ? Only some of the test cases seem to have it. This one for example does not: http://w3c-test.org/pointerevents/pointerevent_pointerenter_nohover-manual.html. Am I overlooking something?
[09:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: Yeah, that test fails for me on my phone.
[09:52:07] <bethge> scott_gonzalez: nice, thanks for testing. Should I ask over at the PE repo?
[09:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you know what? That test should fail on my phone.
[09:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> My phone doesn't have PE.
[09:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:53:02] <bethge> haha
[09:53:23] <bethge> I first thought, wow, he has one of these Windows 10 Mobile phones!
[09:55:26] <scott_gonzalez> I would think that pointerenter on tap should always work, regardless of touch-action.
[09:56:28] <bethge> fair point. I wil check the spec
