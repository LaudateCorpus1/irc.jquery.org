[08:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> Since we already have tags in the repo from the Polymer days, I'd like to propose that our first release is 0.3.0.
[08:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> It's the next highest minor version after the existing tags.
[08:12:50] <arschmitz> +1 i think anything else would be weird
[08:13:04] <arschmitz> and its pretty common first "official" release is NOT 0.1
[11:43:08] <snover> scott_gonzalez: what environments you want?
[11:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> IE9+, latest for others
[11:43:57] <snover> ok. you guys have a browserstack key?
[11:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> Give me a minute to generate one for this project.
[11:50:41] <snover> ok thanks
[11:53:00] <snover> scott_gonzalez: jshint .jshintrc or in package.json?
[11:53:14] <snover> or use eslint?
[11:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what the first question was, but jshint over eslint.
[11:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> The future seems more collaborative with jshint right now.
[11:55:19] <snover> oh, you can either create a .jshintrc or also add a jshintConfig property to package.json
[11:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, definitely .jshintrc
[11:55:45] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't know that jshint would look at package.json.
[11:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> That's kinda crazy.

[16:43:13] <snover> arschmitz: do you have a valid browserstack username/key?
[16:49:17] <pep-commit> [PEP] scottgonzalez closed pull request #164: Use intern for testing2 (master...use-intern-for-testing2) http://git.io/A34V
[17:59:31] <arschmitz> snover: i do
[17:59:58] <arschmitz> snover: should add a readme section for this im sure ill be far from the last to just try and run grunt test
[18:00:27] <snover> sure. i made a couple of updates to the PR, so `grunt test` doesn‚Äôt try to use browserstack directly any more
[18:00:41] <arschmitz> cool
[18:00:53] <snover> `grunt ci` will use browserstack
[18:01:11] <arschmitz> snover: also have you ever tried using grunt-selenium-server
[18:01:49] <arschmitz> nice because then you can npm install it and start it with a grunt task
[18:02:00] <snover> no, that‚Äôs what digdug is supposed to handle but nobody submitted a local selenium tunnel for it yet
[18:02:18] <snover> that one might be useful in this case to reduce the friction
[18:02:27] <arschmitz> that was my thought
[18:03:10] <arschmitz> i did it on another project because a lot of new contributors and didn't want to have to have lots of setup instructions and there the tests need to go through selenium
[18:03:41] <snover> what i‚Äôd *really* like is for someone to submit a digdug tunnel :)
[18:04:42] <arschmitz> snover: i was also thinking maybe add an index.html that just redirects to node_modules/intern/client.html?config=tests/intern
[18:05:21] <arschmitz> since that seems like a somewhat non obvious place to look
[18:05:24] <snover> also sounds legit.
[18:05:36] <snover> though maybe call it runTests.html
[18:05:39] <snover> or something
[18:05:50] <arschmitz> yeah whatever works not picky on names
[18:06:12] <arschmitz> incase we ever what an actual index page
[18:06:16] <snover> long term, that method of running the tests will go away since one of the ideas was to leverage functional testing so we get events from outside the sandbox
[18:06:32] <arschmitz> true
[18:07:08] <arschmitz> a simple redirect pages seems worth it until then though and just delete it after
[18:08:24] <arschmitz> since it wont change before the first release and we will likely get a flood of people then trying and testing anything to just reduce issues asking about how to run the tests i think is worth it
[18:08:33] <snover> makes sense.
[18:11:01] <arschmitz> snover: i can do pr's for one or both of of those though
[18:11:18] <snover> i got it. but i have an important question
[18:11:25] <snover> what should the title of the redirect be
[18:11:37] <snover> it‚Äôs these sorts of decisions that keep me up at night
[18:11:41] <arschmitz> lol
[18:11:46] <snover> <title>Holy moley, just hang on a gosh darn second...</title>
[18:13:35] <arschmitz> <title>this is not the test page your looking for...</title>
[18:15:48] <snover> ran it through translation party and i got our winner
[18:15:49] <snover> ‚ÄúJust hang, hell the next day‚Äù
[18:16:22] <arschmitz> lol
