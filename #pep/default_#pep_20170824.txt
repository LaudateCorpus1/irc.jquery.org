[09:59:08] <zgame> I have an issue in iOS Safari swipe up for fullscreen (toolbar goes away).  When including pep.js, the default browser even is swallowed and as a result the page does not go into fullscreen mode. I tried playing around with touch-action, but with no luck. Is this a known issue in pep.js?
