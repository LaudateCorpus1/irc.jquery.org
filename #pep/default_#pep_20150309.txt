[08:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> snover!
[08:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> Perfect timing. I just came in here to ping you :-)
[08:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> For the .travis.yml, shouldn't `directories:` be indented?
[08:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> I though YAML cared about whitespace.
[08:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> s/though/thought/
[08:06:14] <snover> yes
[08:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> Also, arthurvr's question about travis_retry.
[08:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> Since we're not manually running the npm installs, I don't think we need this.
[08:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> They should automatically be retried.
[08:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> Well, he had a comment about not needing to manually install grunt-cli.
[08:09:37] <snover> itâ€˜s not hurting anything, i just copied a working config that was created before whenever travis changed to bundle grunt-cli
[08:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> But the `npm install` command is automatic. We shouldn't need to do a retry on it.
[08:09:56] <pep-commit> [PEP] ponychicken opened issue #169: Publish on NPM http://git.io/pnww
[08:11:08] <snover> npm install is only automatic if you donâ€™t have an install block
[08:11:11] <pep-commit> [PEP] scottgonzalez closed issue #169: Publish on NPM http://git.io/pnww
[08:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[08:11:27] <snover> and yes you do need to do a retry on it, npm is unreliable
[08:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> I meant we didn't need a retry because it was automatic, so it already had a retry.
[08:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well, since you need to update the file anyway for the directories, let's just drop the install block since it seems like none of it is needed anymore.
[08:14:56] <snover> in the nicest way possible, why all the nitpicking on the travis file?
[08:15:47] <arschmitz> snover: you have seen enough jquery related pr's to know we nit pick everything ;-)
[08:15:50] <snover> are there not more important things to do, like getting this landed and fixing the ie test failures?
[08:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Yes, I'm ready to land this. I just figured our config file doesn't need to have more than necessary.
[08:17:47] <snover> iâ€™m not possessive so if someone wants to mess with it later thatâ€™s fine with me!
[08:17:50] <snover> :)
[08:23:55] <pep-commit> [PEP] scottgonzalez closed pull request #167: Update tests to use Intern (master...intern-tests) http://git.io/xHZG
[09:19:24] <arthurvr> snover: scott_gonzalez: Actually, sorry for all the nitpicking on the .travis.yml! Travis is just slow enough these days so I though we should not need to double-install a dependency.
[09:20:13] <arthurvr> (talking about the `travis_retry npm install -g grunt-cli`, travis automatically has that installed)
[09:20:57] <snover> no worries, i just donâ€™t want people to fall into the trap. perfect is the enemy of good
[09:21:03] <arthurvr> Anyways letâ€™s stop bikeshedding! Nice work snover!
[09:21:08] <snover> and i know, because i tilt at that windmill a *lot*
[09:21:48] <snover> look on the bright side, if they break their vms by forgetting to install grunt-cli, it will still workâ€¦ :)
[09:23:57] <snover> since the node_modules directory is cached it should be pretty fast, the slowest part is the browserstack side
[09:24:36] <snover> it takes less than 3 seconds to establish the environment with the build cache in place
