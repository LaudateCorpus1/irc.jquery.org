[14:02:42] <pep-commit> [PEP] bencroskery opened issue #320: IE Object doesn't support property or method 'contains' https://git.io/vXOH1
[19:07:08] <bethge> I am updating the tests to the latest version from web plattform tests. ~10 tests got remove, some renamed and/or strongly modified and some added. I got so far as kicking out the old ones and am now at 7/50 failing tests. The failues include various spec changes and some test changes. Not sure how to continue.
[19:08:35] <bethge> Going to the version without the spec changes (and thus keeping tests 'greener') would add some extra work with the renaming, and moving of w3c tests that happened over the last months
[19:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> I would suggest updating one commit at a time.
[19:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> At least one commit that affects our tests at a time.
[19:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> That way you're only ever dealing with a single change.
[19:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> If there's a commit that causes lots of failures, what to do would depend on why it's failing.
[19:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> Is it a spec change? Let's just leave the test failing and update our implementation (even if that doesn't happen immediately).
[19:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> If it's just that the test automation needs to change, then we can either update the automation or just delete the automation.
[19:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> Deleting the automation would mean that we have less test coverage, but we'll get that back pretty quicky.
[19:16:57] <bethge> I think for most the automation is ok. We we'll lose a lot of tests due to https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/3668/files and iiuc we'll have to update our tests dowloader to get that coverage back
[19:19:18] <bethge> Got so far as to delete our stale tests. Less tests, less failures ...
[19:20:22] <bethge> I will look some more into why those 7 tests are failing.
