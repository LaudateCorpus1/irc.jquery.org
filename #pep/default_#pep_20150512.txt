[23:16:04] <azanc> Hi everyone, i need a little tip to understand why I succeed creating this button with this effect here http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6638/ but the same code do not work here http://www.vedelago.gov.it/TestNewsletter2.html (probably there is a Jquery Conflict my I am a total newbie on this & jquery, i did not figure out after looking at the docs ) . NOTE: i cannot remove the others .js already present on the 2nd link i wrote (my test page)
[23:21:39] <snover> azanc: this is the channel for pointer events polyfill
[23:23:10] <azanc> snover: Ok i misunderstood what i first read here http://irc.jquery.org/ (not knowing what pep is for). So for << Whether you need help, or you want to help others, or both>> i shoud use the main #jquery?
