[03:20:23] <surferboy>  Greetings, everyone, I have been trying to resolve a conflict jquery related for over 5 monhts and i still cannot resolve it.. there is no mention of the conflict in any online documentation, it's related to firefox, and hyperlinks.. would anyone like to assist ?
[03:53:29] <surferboy> Replace following block,
[03:53:29] <surferboy> $('body').on('click', 'a[href]', function() {
[03:53:29] <surferboy> 	window.location = this.href;
[03:53:29] <surferboy> });
[03:53:29] <surferboy> with,
[03:53:29] <surferboy> $(document).ready(function() {
[03:53:29] <surferboy>   	$('body').on('click', 'a[href]', function() {
[03:53:30] <surferboy>       		window.location = this.href;
[03:53:30] <surferboy> 	});
[03:53:31] <surferboy> });
[03:53:40] <surferboy> this worked
