[18:52:53] <bethge> scott_gonzalez: The behaviour expressed in the current PR is very unexpected, imho.
[19:05:09] <bethge> I admittedly do not fully grasp the issue yet. Couldn't the hover effect from https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues/62 easily be created by using pointerenter and pointerleave?
[19:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> bethge: The description in that ticket is correct. But the change he made to resolve the issue was incorrect.
[19:35:15] <scott_gonzalez> As far as I can tell, the ticket merely says that during capture, over/out should be treated as if they are enter/leave.
[19:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that the reference to :hover was even necessary. But :hover is always based on enter/leave, not over/out.
[19:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise you would never be able to use :hover properly on an element that has children.
