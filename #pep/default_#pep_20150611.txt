[08:45:00] <pep-commit> [PEP] bethge opened pull request #195: Fixes #177 (master...master) http://git.io/vISze
[08:47:10] <M4rius> I want to apologize for again not attending last week. It has been a bit chaotic across the board.
[09:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> No problem M4rius
[09:05:55] <snover> i donâ€™t know how i can ever forgive you
[09:33:00] <jdalton> ohh fancy pep channel
[09:33:06] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:33:53] <snover> i donâ€™t know how i can forgive myself for forgetting that meetings about pep arenâ€™t held in this channel. u_u
[09:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> snover: You can just stay in #jquery-meeting all the time, and you'll get pinged when the meeting starts :-)
[09:35:05] <snover> i have too many chats already !
[09:35:27] <snover> i guess i could just replace #pep with #jquery-meeting since nobody talks here :))
[09:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> I can try to remember to come in here and mention that the meeting is starting.
[09:36:23] <snover> itâ€™s fine, iâ€™m just having a bad brainâ€¦yearâ€¦
[09:36:37] <snover> iâ€™m burnt out and need to take some serious time off
[09:36:52] <snover> incidentally, scott_gonzalez, for the pep test automation, this could be relevant to your interests: https://github.com/theintern/recorder
[09:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, interesting.
[09:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> jdalton: ^
[09:38:17] <jdalton> perfect!
[09:39:24] <arschmitz> snover: oh thats cool!
[09:40:56] <snover> sir, please, you and i both know that i am incapable of doing cool things :)
[18:05:46] <jrossi1> Is it expected that the PointerMap test is failing in master?
[18:06:52] <jrossi1> perhaps regressed by https://github.com/jquery/PEP/commit/8c6d45399a2ae9e93e590e34a0bf454777e851f7
