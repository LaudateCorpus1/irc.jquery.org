[06:49:58] <M4rius> Hi there! Is there something I can do to contribute to PEP? Something you would love to delegate and where I can sharpen my claws?
[06:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius: Sure, have you looked through the open issues?
[06:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/issues/177 would be good.
[06:58:19] <M4rius> Ah great, was just looking at that one too.
[06:58:49] <M4rius> I will get on it.
[06:59:02] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. Let us know if you have any questions.
[06:59:17] <M4rius> Will do, thanks.
