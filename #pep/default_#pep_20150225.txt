[05:00:18] <pep-commit> [PEP] scottgonzalez closed issue #160: Remove UMD wrapper http://git.io/NGIO
[08:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> We got linked to from Ars Technica: http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/pointer-events-finalized-but-apples-lack-of-support-still-a-deal-breaker/
[08:33:26] <arschmitz> i saw this morning pretty awesome
[08:47:07] <arthurvr> Great! \o/
[11:22:07] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers: nice to see someone covering the patent issue with touch events; this article is another one using "jQuery" or "jQuery team", but "jQuery Foundation" is never used...
[11:23:42] <kborchers> yeah ... i attribute that to just a result of the usual perception that there is no difference which is something the foundation has to keep working on
[11:25:13] <jzaefferer> might help to actually contact news outlets, both to give a heads-up in news worth covering and to tell them how to refer to us...
[11:29:06] <jzaefferer> this visitors graph looks nice: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/graphs/traffic
[12:01:59] <arschmitz> apparently traffic is only visible to people with push
