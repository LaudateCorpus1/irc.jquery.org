[17:22:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / all -- anyone know of a react-pep ?
[17:23:13] <gnarf> and/or is PEP stable enough for me to try writing it now?
[17:23:29] <gnarf> I really need a reliable onTouchEnd that fires on the thing you let go on instead of the thing you started touching
[17:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I don't know of one. It's stable enough for you to work on it though.
