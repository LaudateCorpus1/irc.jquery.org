[09:35:56] <jperrault> snover: can you take a look at this when you get a chance? Thanks!  https://gist.github.com/JacquesPerrault/522556a91cfc533d0f90
[09:37:06] <snover> you shouldn’t be redefining the map like that
[09:38:38] <snover> https://github.com/theintern/intern-tutorial/blob/completed-tutorial/tests/intern.js
[09:38:47] <snover> should be enough
[09:44:14] <snover> does that make sense?
[09:44:38] <snover> right now you’re overriding part of the internals that are necessary for intern to work correctly, destroying the existing mapping to diff
[12:13:46] <jperrault> So, that works fine for the tutorial.
[12:14:30] <jperrault> For PEP, the tests are in the \test directory, and as you would expect, set up for chai and mocha, with files like "setup.js" and "karma-setup.js".  I'm not sure if those need to be wrapped, or re-written.  But they declare a chai object that intern doesn't know what to do with.
[12:22:49] <snover> jperrault: where is this declaration?
[12:24:25] <jperrault> test\setup.js
[12:24:48] <snover> define([ 'intern/chai!' ], function (chai) { … })
[12:24:55] <snover> it is the same object
[12:25:02] <snover> just wrap it
[12:30:50] <jperrault> ah.  I was close.  I took your last recommendation too literally.  I had define([ 'intern!tdd', 'intern/chai!' ], function (tdd, expect) {
[12:30:57] <jperrault> it is happier now.
[12:32:44] <arschmitz> jperrault: but arn't you supposed to torture interns with coffee and lunch runs not make them happy?
[12:32:56] <arschmitz> seems like your missing out on the sprit of it
[12:33:21] <jperrault> my interns are minors, they frown on that.
[12:33:24] <jperrault> :-)
[12:33:34] <arschmitz> jperrault: ha ha ha
[12:34:39] <arschmitz> jperrault: i supposed interns are probably more productive when treated well too
[12:34:50] <arschmitz> jperrault: and this is one intern we need working well lol
[12:34:52] <jperrault> my 10 y/o son is more into java and minecraft mods, unfortunately.  If I can get mojang to write a javascript port, I will have some solid help here.
[12:35:10] <arschmitz> nice
