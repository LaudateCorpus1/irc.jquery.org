[09:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Did you see https://gist.github.com/csnover/db940197652a0c9231f6 ?
[09:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> snover said he sent you a mesasge on Skype because you weren't on IRC when he got back.
[09:29:06] <arschmitz> we really need bo-t in here
[09:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> I filed an issue for infra to get that done.
[09:29:27] <snover> LIKE THAT?
[09:29:28] <snover> :)
[09:29:28] <jzaefferer> jperrault: I can set you up with jQuery's ZNC server
[09:29:31] <jperrault> :-)
[09:29:32] <arschmitz> i know because i went to and saw you did about an hour before me
[09:30:49] <snover> unfortunately the next time someone restarts the bot or it drops off the network it wonâ€™t remember to come back
[09:31:42] <jperrault> k.  I don't spend much time on skype, and I use webchat for irc out of convenience.
[09:33:07] <jperrault> snover: i see your response on skype, thanks, I'll give that a go.
