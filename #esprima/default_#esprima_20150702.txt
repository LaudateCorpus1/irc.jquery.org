[13:54:52] <thealphanerd> mikesherov_: have you ever done any work to allow you to reference methods / properties as const and make sure that const functions are deterministic
[14:56:57] <efaust> so, I have a question of method definitions in estree
[14:58:41] <efaust> currently, it looks like the MethodDefinition node is only valid inside class definition nodes? And method definitions are also viable inside object litterals. Probably there should be an interface extension to ObjectExpression that makes properties have type  [ Property | MethodDefintiion ], or something?
[15:35:26] <dherman> efaust: that does seem surprising. I'd expect exactly what you just said in es6 ast spec
[15:37:24] <dherman> mikesherov_: ^^ ?
[15:40:14] <efaust> I'm working on cleaning up the FF side of issue 1203, and trying to fix up some other discrepencies while I'm here
