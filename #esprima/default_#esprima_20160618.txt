[10:56:14] <NickLou> Hello all. New user here, just cloned repo but interested to contribute.
[11:18:40] <NickLou> Question: would there be a point if we added an event mechanism for AST node traversing on built-in esprima?
[11:19:20] <NickLou> For instance, being able to register event functions, so that when a specific node is visited, a callback is triggered.
