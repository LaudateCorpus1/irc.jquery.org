[00:31:34] <jbeard4> hello
[00:32:17] <jbeard4> I was wondering if anyone knows, is there a reliable way to do code generation with esprima, such that CST information (line/column numbers) are preserved?
[00:32:53] <jbeard4> it looks like the escodegen project does not make use of the line/col information from esprima
