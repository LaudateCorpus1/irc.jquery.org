[16:49:54] <guylewin> Hey guys, general question about the standard - I noticed Comment objects parsed by esprima have fields like "type" which can be "BlockComment" or "LineComment"
[16:50:19] <guylewin> Is that some sort of standard API? Or is it esprima specific? I made a PR to add a new field and I want to know if I'm breaking any API
[16:50:49] <guylewin> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1999 - thats my PR
