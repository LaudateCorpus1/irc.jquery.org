[22:36:18] <thealphanerd> oh haiâ€¦ kborchers said to hang out here
[22:36:58] <kborchers> thealphanerd: yo :)
[22:37:32] <thealphanerd> just figuring out where this channel is going to live in my idle list
[22:38:11] <thealphanerd> I think it is going to live comfortable between #stackvm and #nerdtracker although this is subject to change
[22:38:28] <thealphanerd> kborchers: so last minute moveâ€¦ Iâ€™m going to be at jQueryUK
[22:39:57] <kborchers> thealphanerd: i heard from anne
[22:40:08] <kborchers> i unfortunately won't be there
[22:40:26] <thealphanerd> alas :D
[22:40:35] <thealphanerd> that was not meant to be a smileyâ€¦ how do you even emoticon
[22:40:43] <kborchers> lol
[22:41:08] <thealphanerd> the estree spec looks super promising!
[22:41:38] <thealphanerd> perhaps it can iron out some â€œphilosophical differences"
[22:42:34] <thealphanerd> btwâ€¦ â€”> https://github.com/estools/escodegen  This was the project I was mentioning when we hung out
[22:42:43] <thealphanerd> for turning esprima ASTâ€™s back into strings
[22:53:27] <thealphanerd> in fact the core contributor is in this very channel â€”> yusukesuzuki
[23:58:46] <yusukesuzuki> yeah, i'm in this channel :)
