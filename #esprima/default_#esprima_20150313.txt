[12:06:45] <kumavis> hello o/
[12:07:27] <kumavis> I'm running into some issues related to comment parsing -- I know this is a bit of a trouble spot
[12:08:28] <kumavis> with some large changes in store: e.g. https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1068
[12:10:48] <kumavis> im doing some parsing with esprima, modifying the ast, then generating with escodegen
[12:10:56] <kumavis> this results in duplicated comments in some cases
[12:11:42] <kumavis> i've found that that esprima puts the same comment in the ast twice, once as a leading comment and once as a trailing comment.
[12:12:29] <kumavis> I'm trying to figure out if thats a feature (added to both, up to code generator to pick one) or a bug (should only appear in ast once)
[12:14:02] <kumavis> happy to contribute tests, just need to know the intended behaviour
