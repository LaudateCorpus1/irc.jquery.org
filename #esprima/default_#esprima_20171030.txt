[12:24:53] <iosys> thwee, is there anyway we can see the code? how you set the callback?
[19:17:50] <sporks> i'm making an atom package that's a bit like blocky or scratch and i'd like to be able to use stuff like esprima to get the data i need to know hierarchies like what node should be allowed in what other nodes. having trouble understanding esprima nodes to be able to do that. ideas?
[19:18:44] <sporks> i've been looking at the code, https://esprima.readthedocs.io/en/4.0/syntax-tree-format.html, and http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html
[19:19:12] <sporks> i can't figure out stuff like what an array pattern is
[19:32:51] <sporks> kk i'll bb or figure somethin'
