[12:34:27] <iosys> Hi
[12:37:19] <iosys> Im using esprima-python to convert a .js file to ast tree and its working great. and im also using https://github.com/austinbyers/esprima-ast-visitor to walk on the ast tree to extract the information etc...
[12:38:18] <iosys> the problem i have is to reconstruct back the tree to the code
[12:38:29] <iosys> im visiting the tree like :
[12:38:30] <iosys> for node in visitor.traverse(json.loads(esprima_ast_string)):
[12:38:36] <iosys>     print(node['type'])
[12:39:29] <iosys> i tried to save all 'node' to a file, but i doesnt give me the same structure as the original ast tree
[12:40:00] <iosys> what is the correct way of reconstructing the ast tree?
