[17:27:19] <sebmck> getify needs to calm down
[19:51:47] <mikesherov> jeffmo: you there?
[19:59:29] <jeffmo> mikesherov: for like 5 more mins, heh
[19:59:31] <jeffmo> sup?
[20:00:00] <mikesherov> wanted to ask about generators
[20:00:09] <mikesherov> if Fb was going to do that work for 2.2
[20:00:13] <mikesherov> also, caridy is going to port new module syntax directly to master
[20:00:24] <jeffmo> mikesherov: I havenâ€™t heard anything else from him, so Iâ€™m going to assume itâ€™s prob not going to happen soon :(
[20:00:46] <mikesherov> was wondering if when / who was going to port modules to harmony
[20:01:05] <mikesherov> when do you get soon avalability again?
[20:01:13] <mikesherov> no pressure, just curious
[20:01:23] <jeffmo> mikesherov: I can probably do that â€” Iâ€™m building out module stuff for flow right now (which is why Iâ€™ve been so busy), and will need to port some of that back to esprima/harmony soon probably anyway
[20:01:44] <mikesherov> ok, so caridy will get it to master, then you from there?
[20:01:52] <jeffmo> yea sounds good
[20:02:04] <mikesherov> can you also review my template strings tokens fix?
