[10:30:06] <mikesherov> now I'm confused
[10:30:51] <mikesherov> jeffmo: ikarienator dherman sebmck is everyone ok now with https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/38/files
[10:30:58] <mikesherov> and also https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/39/files
[10:33:12] <jeffmo> mikesherov: 39 looks good. Cross-checking 38 with spec really quickly before thumbsupping...
[10:34:37] <jeffmo> mikesherov: wait, I don‚Äôt think 38 is done yet‚Ä¶ commenting inline
[10:37:14] <mikesherov> jeffmo do you mind putting an actual +1 on 39 https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/39
[10:37:18] <mikesherov> sebmck: ^
[10:37:31] <jeffmo> mikesherov: done
[10:40:36] <mikesherov> jeffmo it seems from the https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/311 that everyone is OK with no hoistableDeclaration and that we have agreement though? I was having a hard time parsing (no pun intended) that thread
[10:45:03] <jeffmo> mikesherov: I‚Äôm still slightly unclear as to what everyone means by `HoistableDeclaration` ‚Äî do they mean a FunctionDeclaration with a nullable id property? Or do they mean a wrapper node of type HoistableDeclaration? I am against the latter‚Ä¶and I think others are too, but if that‚Äôs the case then why does it keep coming up in descriptions? Is everyone just using it as shorthand for ‚Äúnullable func decl id property‚Äù?
[10:45:36] <mikesherov> caridy mentioned it here: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/311#issuecomment-73277468
[10:46:49] <mikesherov> and then it was in the initial version of that PR: https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/38#discussion-diff-25634784R166
[10:50:05] <jeffmo> mikesherov: commented on #38
[10:50:30] <jeffmo> (regarding another matter)
[10:50:43] <jeffmo> going back to see if I can clarify the hoisted decl stuff for myself...
[10:52:50] <jeffmo> mikesherov: ok, I think at least Caridy and I are on the same page it seems. The question remains as to whether sebmck and rreverser still have issue with nullable `id‚Äô fields on FunctionDeclaration node. As long as everyone is ok with them being nullable, I think we have concensus
[10:53:16] <jeffmo> If I‚Äôm the only one who doesn‚Äôt think it should be nullable, I‚Äôll probably make one last desperate cry for justification before giving up
[10:53:46] <jeffmo> *if I‚Äôm the only one who thinks it *should* be nullable
[10:54:37] <mikesherov> Jeffmo, that's fine too
[10:54:58] <mikesherov> But even that is a different PR and issue, because now that PR makes no mention of function declaration
[11:13:20] <jeffmo> mikesherov: regarding https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1086 ‚Äî did we decide on a defactor means of landing PRs? BigGreenButton? A bot that does it for us? Or is sticking that ‚ÄúCloses gh-1086‚Äù string in the commit message (and committing however I like) good enough?
[11:15:02] <mikesherov> jeffmo definitely no big green button
[11:16:23] <mikesherov> typically what I do is: `git pull upstream master && git checkout http://github.com/jquery/esprima/pulls/1086 && git rebase master && git commit --amend && git checkout master && git merge - && npm test && git push upstream master`
[11:16:39] <mikesherov> that's assuming you have `hub` installed which allows you to checkout PR's by url
[11:16:49] <mikesherov> and that in the amend step, you add the correct stuff
[11:17:12] <mikesherov> eventually we'll have a landing bot
[11:17:25] <jeffmo> mikesherov: ok ‚Äî but just to be sure I understand the underlying needs of the process ‚Äî the only set bit we have is tagging PRs when they solve a particular issue?
[11:17:37] <jeffmo> mikesherov: got it, so the landing bot is still a TODO
[11:17:42] <mikesherov> that and no merge commits
[11:17:46] <jeffmo> right
[11:18:00] <jeffmo> ok cool, thanks
[11:18:11] <mikesherov> jeffmo underlying needs here: https://github.com/jquery/esprima/wiki/Maintainer's-Guide
[11:18:27] <jeffmo> mikesherov: perfect, thanks
[11:18:32] <mikesherov> np
[11:41:11] <dherman> mikesherov: I have nothing to add re: 38, I'm fine if/when everyone else is
[11:41:14] * dherman reads 39
[11:43:41] <dherman> it's unfortunate and confusing that nodes called ImportDeclaration and ExportDeclaration are not Declarations
[11:44:55] <dherman> I guess the names come from the grammar though
[11:52:09] <dherman> ha I bet that's my fault too
[11:52:11] <dherman> everything is my fault
[12:03:35] <mikesherov> lol
