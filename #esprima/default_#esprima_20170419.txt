[16:42:33] <sqdfdgfdgdazraez> I'd like to compare two "large" minified (jsbeautified) scripts that [I guess should] share large portions of code. My problem is that one has been minified so that args of func are a,b,c,d... while the other has inconsistent scheme (c,b,a,f...)
[16:43:33] <sqdfdgfdgdazraez> how difficult would it be to process the sources so that I force naming of args ?
[16:44:37] <sqdfdgfdgdazraez> And first, could esprima be usefull for such a task ?
[16:49:23] <sqdfdgfdgdazraez> I tried jsnice with no luck (too large file)
[16:51:27] <sqdfdgfdgdazraez> I'm comparing the file with meld on Linux and it's difficult to spot the portions of code that have been altered.
