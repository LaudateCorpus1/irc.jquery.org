[19:26:45] <fool4javascript> i want to grab (and parse) the shortest legal javascript expression from the beginning of a string or stream and, where what follows that expression may not be legal javascript.  can i do that with esprima?
[19:31:09] <fool4javascript> (or maybe i don't need to parse it; it can eval it instead; i just need a way to identify the portion of the beginning of the string or stream that is a minimal expression)
