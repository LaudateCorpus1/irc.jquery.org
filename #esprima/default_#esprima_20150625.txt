[04:47:17] <fullstack> Hi I'm trying to learn how to traverse AST estree for a 'Identifier' and then name 'myObject', but myObject appears twice in my code and I don't have a good enough understanding to traverse to code so that it conditionally gives me the second "correct" node in the AST.  And "Correct" node meaning its parent is  a FunctionExpression ... that is an argument for a parent that is an ExpressStatement /CallExpression/MemberExpression ...
[04:49:02] <fullstack> basically... here is the code : app.config(function(arg) { myObject.func1() } ); http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html?code=app.config(function(arg)%7BmyObject.func()%20%7D)%3B
[04:51:02] <fullstack> How would I write that? Any pointers, tutorials, example code, documents would be appreciated.  So far all the tutorials I've found are one-off for a single node condition, not multiple parent->parent->node
[04:51:46] <fullstack> I guess it would be a "conditional nested tree match".. to say it in english
[06:15:39] <fullstack> either via bfs or dfs
