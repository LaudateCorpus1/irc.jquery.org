[16:42:49] <evocatus> hello, given an ES6 module (e.g. `import { expect } from chai;`), I am trying to lookup the declarations for Identifiers imported from other external modules (in the previous example, I would like to get the declaration of `expect`)
[16:43:11] <evocatus> I can get at the Identifiers easily through esprima, but not sure how to "link" the imported modules to get at its source
[16:43:41] <evocatus> I understand this probably isn't something esprima can do, but wondering if someone can point me in the right direction to a tool I can use, possibly in conjunction with esprima, to accomplish this
