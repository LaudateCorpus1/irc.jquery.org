[07:38:15] <mikesherov> jeffmo: sebmck  jqlog now logs this room and the esprima-meeting room to http://irc.jquery.org/%23esprima/ http://irc.jquery.org/%23esprima-meeting/
[08:49:03] <mikesherov> dherman: we need to figure out who gets org access to estree
[08:49:33] <mikesherov> ideally someone from each member org?
[09:21:44] <dherman> mikesherov: why don't we change the members list to people instead of organizations?
[09:21:56] <dherman> (re: your PR)
[09:22:27] <dherman> mikesherov: and I'm happy to give out access
[09:37:21] <mikesherov> dherman: sounds good, I'll list people and projects and leave orgs out?
[09:38:03] <dherman> it's fine to list affiliation. I'd do "* Dave Herman (Mozilla)"
[09:38:16] <mikesherov> Fair enough.
[09:38:21] <dherman> it's just good to make it clear this is grassroots
[09:38:30] <mikesherov> Yes
[09:38:52] <mikesherov> So can you give me and rreverser repo access?
[09:39:29] <dherman> you bet
[09:39:30] <dherman> one sec
[09:41:50] <dherman> mikesherov: invite sent
[11:13:10] <Swatinem> oh, its quite full here now :-)
[13:40:08] <mikesherov> jeffmo: thoughts on this https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1024
[13:40:52] <jeffmo> mikesherov: looking..
[18:36:43] <dherman> mikesherov: is https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/10 what you were looking for?
[18:37:23] <dherman> mikesherov: also should I eliminate `guardedHandlers: [];` from the main spec? IIRC esprima generates it but there's probably no need to actually mandate that an empty array be there
[18:59:05] <mikesherov> dherman yes to both. I'll need to file Esprima bug for that.
[19:43:47] <dherman> Kk
[19:43:50] <dherman> Will update
[20:43:25] <sebmck> i'll try to put together some PRs this weekend for estree based on consistent acorn/esprima behaviour
[20:53:06] <dherman> <3
