[15:26:53] <dherman> mikesherov: I think I just got my script running (sorry for all the delay) and AFAICT basically nobody in the FF addon ecosystem uses Reflect.parse

[15:27:12] <dherman> I will get to those bugs asap
[15:32:55] <mikesherov> dherman that's great news.
[15:33:24] <mikesherov> Thanks for digging in there
[16:06:05] <mikesherov> sebmck merge the getify PR. No reason to exclude.
