[22:07:29] <thwee> Hi. I successfully installed esprima-4.0 on my ijavascript jupyter notebook, and am trying to use the parseScript() function with the callback argument to console.log the nodes. I get an AST as a return value, but the callback never seems to be called. What should I do?
[22:10:49] <thwee> Just figured it out, I had to include an empty option parameter.
