[15:37:45] <knod> Hi, I've been looking at this library that uses esprima (https://github.com/btmills/trace) and it creates an object by parsing text with esprima. It adds `loc` and `range` (https://github.com/btmills/trace/blob/master/assets/js/tracer.coffee#L66-L69) and I was wondering if it's possible to also get the text value that's being used.
[15:38:14] <knod> My problem is that in javascript there are hoisted function declarations and I'm trying to recognize them, but I'm not sure how
[15:38:34] <knod> So I figured I'd search the text to see if it said 'function' in it and go from there
[15:44:18] <knod> Here's the demo of that library I mentioned: http://btmills.github.io/trace/
[15:44:48] <knod> You'll see it doesn't properly register the function expression (that's what it's called, right?)
