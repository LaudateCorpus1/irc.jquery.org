[01:06:20] <sebmck> any chance i can be added to the estree org? i'm up for triaging some issues
[14:51:41] <dherman> sebmck: you bet
[14:51:58] <sebmck> dherman: rreverser beat you to it :P
[14:52:00] <sebmck> thanks though!
[14:52:09] <dherman> Haha
[14:57:29] <dherman> sebmck: I love the 6to5/babel font... Trying to think of iconic 90's California pop culture where I've seen it
[14:57:37] <dherman> Or maybe 80s
[15:05:44] <sebmck> dherman: thanks! i'm super happy with how the logo turned out, i'm terrible at photoshop but somehow managed to throw something together...
[15:06:28] <dherman> :)
[17:02:59] <dherman> sebmck: do you have a good sense of all the tools with significant constituencies using the format?
[17:03:21] <dherman> We should make sure that all of them feel represented
[17:03:28] <dherman> In order for progress to have legitimacy
[17:03:58] <sebmck> dherman: i guess so, we've basically got every major player involved
[17:04:19] <sebmck> at least i think so
[17:04:48] <dherman> As long as every major player is reviewing the bugs then I'd think the only process we need is being sure they're on board with issues and PRs
[23:32:24] <sebmck> what's the name of the IDL in estree?
