[08:13:22] <ben_alman> danheberden: fwiw, multiple photos in the header of http://events.jquery.org/ are mine but there is no link back to my site in the credits section
[08:13:41] <ben_alman> or at least http://www.flickr.com/photos/rj3
[08:14:27] <danheberden> ben_alman: that's probably my fault because they were on the old events page with credit and someone probably just took the psd
[08:14:33] <danheberden> i'll file an issue
[08:14:39] <ben_alman> np
[08:14:40] <ben_alman> thanks!
