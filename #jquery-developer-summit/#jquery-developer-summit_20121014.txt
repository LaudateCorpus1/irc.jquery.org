[08:41:57] <kpepin> Good morning folks.
[08:42:51] <ryanneufeld> morning
[08:43:07] <ryanneufeld> I think this will be a fairly dead channel today
[08:43:17] <ryanneufeld> everyone traveling
[08:44:23] <kpepin> Most likely, yeah.  I'm already at the hotel... tryign to get my builds/setup working for tomorrow morning.
[08:45:15] <ryanneufeld> nice
[08:45:31] <ryanneufeld> are you using the infra vms?
[08:49:07] <ryanneufeld> well, I gotta finish packing and eat some breakfast before I leave
[08:49:10] <ryanneufeld> see you all soon!
[10:47:40] <kswedberg> is anyone else at the hotel yet?
[13:44:18] <RBeuligmann> Anyone else at the doubletree?
[14:30:38] <erickrdch> yups
[14:32:24] <erickrdch> been here (doubletree) since morning :P
[15:13:14] <RBeuligmann> So at the doubletree, going to try and find some dinner if anyone else is here and would like to meetup
[16:31:21] <kpepin> So are there any others out there that are new to some of the tools we're using for the builds, etc., or am I the only guy that hasn't developed much with LAMP platforms?
[16:36:03] <jzaefferer> There's a bunch of people outside the elevator on the sixth floor
[16:37:52] <RBeuligmann> Jquery people or just people?
[17:02:39] <jzaefferer> RBeuligmann: just people, just people...
[17:14:08] <ryanneufeld> hola amigos
[17:14:19] <kpepin> Hi again ryan
[17:14:46] <ryanneufeld> my flight was delayed
[17:14:52] <ryanneufeld> :(
[17:14:55] <kpepin> Doh!
[17:14:58] <kpepin> That sucks.
[17:15:01] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:15:05] <ryanneufeld> something wrong with the plane
[17:15:14] <ryanneufeld> I'd rather wait for new plane in that case :p
[17:15:22] <ryanneufeld> Ooohh, crew is arriving
[17:15:26] <kpepin> Better they caught it on the ground rather than when you were airborn I guess.
[17:15:26] <ryanneufeld> should be boarding soon
[17:15:41] <ryanneufeld> well, it might have been okay to fly
[17:15:50] <ryanneufeld> but they don't fuck around
[17:15:55] <kpepin> hehehe
[17:16:46] <kpepin> Ok... been a long day for me between travel and getting everything set up on my laptop (I hope I've got it all set up right!  Everything builds and tests ok at least...).
[17:17:10] <kpepin> I'm going to shut down, watch the Walking Dead premier and call it a night.  See you all in the AM.  :)
[17:17:30] <ryanneufeld> kpepin: coolbeans
[17:17:34] <ryanneufeld> see you in the morning
[17:45:00] <gnarf> boo flights
[17:45:07] <gnarf> stuck in chicagoland
[17:51:51] <ajpiano> :(
[17:54:59] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah, WTB laughter til midnight
[17:56:50] <gnarf> anyway, AFK a few minutes, going to go eat an airline subsidized dinner at my airline comped hotel room
[17:57:22] <gnarf> if ryanneufeld shows up - have him ping me on skype or something, I'll try to give him some words of morning wisdom
[17:59:43] <ajpiano> hopefully you'll be there by the time we really start work
[18:17:51] <Rwhitbeck> So do we just get a shuttle to the hotel?  I am coming in in the morning?
[18:18:15] <Rwhitbeck> that last sentence was not a question :P
[18:32:32] <ajpiano> Rwhitbeck: there's supposed to be a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, but by the time you get in you''ll probably ned to get to AOL after, and i don't think the shuttle will be running at that point
[18:32:32] <ajpiano> you mgiht want to call leah or the hotel, they have more informationa bout the shuttle than i do
[18:32:33] <ajpiano> i'm taking the train :p
[18:34:07] <Rwhitbeck> I figured a taxi to AOL anyways.
[18:48:00] <toddmparker_> Hi all
[18:52:08] <gnarf> Rwhitbeck: what time in the morning?
[18:52:40] <Rwhitbeck> 9:46 I land .. right after you.
[18:52:50] <gnarf> IAD?
[18:52:58] <Rwhitbeck> yep
[18:53:06] <gnarf> yeah, I'm DCA now
[18:53:42] <gnarf> maybe it will work out that we can share a cab to AOL
[18:54:02] <Rwhitbeck> sure,  SKype me your number
[18:54:58] <gnarf> hey ajpiano is there an official hash tag?
[18:55:08] <ajpiano> #jqdevsummit

[19:19:11] <addoyle> hello everyone
[19:20:05] <addoyle> are there going to be separate channels for each table?
[19:20:54] <Rwhitbeck> no we're going to experiment with social interaction ;-)
[19:21:06] <JonahSchulte> Haha
[19:21:10] <addoyle> oh noes
[19:34:18] <gnarf> :)
[19:34:18] <gnarf> yeah
[19:34:50] <gnarf> there are some other backchannels that might get used -- #jquery-dev, #jqueryui-dev, #jquerymobile-dev -- but for the most part, everyone will be setting at the table :)
[19:35:22] <gnarf> s/setting/sitting
[19:35:23] <gnarf> hey gibson042
[19:38:07] <gibson042> yo

[19:47:07] <JonahSchulte> there are
[19:47:11] <JonahSchulte> from 7:30am to 10:00am
[19:47:13] <JonahSchulte> every 30 minutes
[19:49:43] <addoyle> gnarf: is there a specific vm we should download beforehand?
[19:49:51] <addoyle> cuz if the wifi is as slow as it is now
[19:50:00] <gnarf> addoyle: AOL has big pipes
