[12:18:11] <dnschnur> Hi everyone! I'm getting my env set up, and at the end of the web-base-template install, when I visit dev.jquery.com to set up Wordpress, I enter a redirect loop.  The webserver log shows a database error due to a table not existing.  The only setup step that seems questionable is the rewrite rules; I'm using nginx and may have screwed up the translation from Apache rewrite.  Has anyone else used nginx that I could
[12:23:59] <ajpiano> dnschnur: what version of php are you running
[12:24:56] <dnschnur> 5.4.7
[12:28:22] <ajpiano> ohhh sorry dnschnur, didn't read quite all the way through to the end
[12:28:27] <ajpiano> that's a pretty good point
[12:28:35] <ajpiano> i don't know if we haev nginx rules canonically done
[12:28:41] <ajpiano> gnarf: danheberden ^^
[12:30:28] <gnarf> dnschnur: one sec
[12:32:31] <gnarf> dnschnur: https://gist.github.com/726b3db5076d273491ff
[12:32:56] <gnarf> dnschnur: thats the nginx config we use for wordpress
[12:33:00] <gnarf> using php-fpm
[12:33:43] <dnschnur> Thanks!
[12:45:16] <gnarf> dnschnur: don't thank me til it works ;)
[12:45:20] <gnarf> did it work? :)
[12:46:09] <dnschnur> Hmm apparently that wasn't the issue, since the error is unchanged.  Am I correct in assuming that the first visit to the site initializes the database, or am I missing a step?
[12:47:17] <gnarf> did you go to install.php or whatever?
[12:47:30] <gnarf> i don't remember what the steps are --- ajpiano?
[12:48:11] <gnarf> also ajpiano https://gist.github.com/726b3db5076d273491ff -- for the people using nginx locally??
[12:48:36] <dnschnur> The instructions were just to visit dev.jquery.com; I did also try dev.jquery.com/web-base-template/install.php, but got more or less the same result.
[12:58:15] <gnarf> hrm
[12:58:30] <gnarf> I'm sorry, I actually don't know a ton about that process, mine is very different
[13:00:46] <dnschnur> No worries; I'll dig around some more
[13:03:23] <ajpiano> nacin might also be able to help out, dnschnur
[13:04:12] <nacin> what'd I do
[13:04:33] <ajpiano> the webasite, it don'ta worka
[13:04:52] <nacin> I heart nginx and use it everywhere except local dev. too painful.
[13:05:19] <nacin> the database error is very likely expected pre-install, and not the issue.
[13:05:54] <nacin> so I'd think that the blame still rests in redirect rules
[13:06:24] <nacin> use the web inspector to figure out the rewrite loop
[13:06:44] <nacin> make sure you followed the instructions including using web-base-template's sample wp-config
[18:44:24] <JonahSchulte> Hey folks, I have a question regarding development for Table 14 (Mobile Bugs) - https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki/Table-14:-Mobile-Bugs
[18:44:33] <JonahSchulte> It says on that page I will need jsfiddle.net and browserstack.com accounts
[18:44:39] <JonahSchulte> But no other environment setup needed?
[18:44:44] <JonahSchulte> Seems to easy :)
[18:44:47] <JonahSchulte> *too
[19:38:40] <gnarf> what else were you expecting? :)
[19:39:09] <JonahSchulte> Let's just say I am looking forward to this ;-)
[19:39:32] <JonahSchulte> So used to immense complexity that working in jsfiddle should be a delight
[19:39:41] <JonahSchulte> Though I am wondering about workflow, etc
[19:39:54] <JonahSchulte> If we fix an issue, do we create a pull request for our fix?
[19:40:28] <JonahSchulte> I am kind of a newbie when it comes to contributing to projects on github but should have been doing that for years at this point...
[19:42:07] <gnarf> git/github will likely be a part of your workflow, yes
[19:42:35] <gnarf> Wilto / gseguin - lurking?
[19:42:42] <JonahSchulte> I will also RTFM - https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
[19:42:55] <gseguin> yes sir?
[19:43:08] <gseguin> gnarf: ^
[19:43:31] <gnarf> gseguin: your table right?
[19:43:46] <gnarf> got any other prep / environment / pep talks for JonahSchulte? :)
[19:43:54] <JonahSchulte> :)
[19:44:09] * gseguin catches up
[19:44:34] <JonahSchulte> Just want to be sure I can hit the ground running. Ideally would like to get everything set up ahead of time and possibly contribute a couple of bug fixes over the next week so we don't waste any time. :)
[19:46:36] <gseguin> yeah that's pretty much all you need with the essentials: a github account & a text editor (with soft tabs disabled)
[19:47:07] <gseguin> JonahSchulte: you have a fork of the project to do pull requests?
[19:47:30] <JonahSchulte> Yes, was just thinking Fork & Pull then commit fixes and create pull requests for those fixes?
[19:47:35] <JonahSchulte> And thank you for not using soft tabs :)
[19:48:08] <gseguin> heh I don't care either ways as long as it's consistent accross the project ;)
[19:48:26] <JonahSchulte> I hear you there
[19:48:43] <JonahSchulte> Ok, then I think I am all set. Can't wait for the 15th!
[19:49:19] <gseguin> get ready to squish bugs!
[19:49:52] <JonahSchulte> So ready! We've actually had a few of these events where I work over the past year and it's a ton of fun.
[19:49:59] <JonahSchulte> First event we fixed 200 bugs in 12 hours
[19:50:17] <JonahSchulte> With about 25 developers
[19:50:22] <gseguin> nice!
[19:50:32] <JonahSchulte> Second one we fixed 137 bugs in 12 hours, but we'd already cleaned up the easy ones :)
[19:51:21] <gseguin> one of the side of this exercise is going to scrub the bugs and build test cases to try to reproduce
[19:51:44] <gseguin> as well as write unit tests to go along with the fix
[19:51:57] <JonahSchulte> so I should brush up on qunit then?
[19:52:11] <JonahSchulte> We're trying to get something like that integrated into our system as well so it would be nice to dive into that
[19:52:12] <gseguin> Yeah that can't hurt
[19:52:38] <JonahSchulte> We have tons of code and very little testing, so one of my projects for the next year is to implement a nice test suite
