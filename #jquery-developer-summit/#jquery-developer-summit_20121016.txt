[07:30:06] <morgan> First pull request accepted. W00t
[07:30:10] <JonahSchulte> congrats!
[07:34:23] <couchand> anybody seen this in the firebug console: Error in protected function: !93
[07:36:03] <anfield> anyone familiar with grunt able to help with a Terminal error?
[07:36:33] <patrickkettner> @anfield whats the error
[07:36:41] <patrickkettner> @anfield also, check out #grunt
[07:36:48] <anfield> thanks
[07:36:51] <anfield> this is the error
[07:36:53] <anfield> Linting grunt.js...ERROR [L6:C1] Missing "use strict" statement. grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-clean" );  <WARN> Task "lint:grunt" failed. Use --force to continue. </WARN>
[07:36:59] <Wilto> Shout-out to Bastion on screen just now.
[07:37:19] <patrickkettner> @anfield what is line 6 of your grunt file look like
[07:37:24] <patrickkettner> er, line 5-7
[07:37:52] <anfield> grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-clean" ); grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-html" ); grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-wordpress" ); grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-jquery-content" );
[07:38:24] <patrickkettner> whats your jshint options
[07:38:39] <anfield> 		options: { 			undef: true, 			node: true 		}
[07:38:59] <patrickkettner> can you gist the whole config?
[07:39:05] <anfield> sure 1 sec
[07:39:58] <anfield> https://gist.github.com/3899682
[07:42:09] <jzaefferer> anfield: Scott and Ben were probably looking at the same issue just now, caused by new jshint version in grunt 0.3.17
[07:42:29] <anfield> ah
[07:42:32] <anfield> okay
[07:42:57] <anfield> <-- Paul Kane @ table 5
[07:49:51] <Wilto> ay everybody come work at the mobile tables we got mad phones and such
[07:52:05] <JonahSchulte> hell yeah, make all the phone calls you want, Wilto's payin'
[07:52:34] <Wilto> 1-800 numbers only.
[07:58:34] <DavidSouther> General question/discussion topic I'm interested in: Has anyone looked at or played with black-box in browser integration testing for anything?
[08:06:20] <ryanneufeld> What's with the muzak?
[08:08:41] <addoyle> mikesherov: the evil 40-50 second query is now down to 3-5 seconds!
[08:09:02] <addoyle> mikesherov: in trac, that is
[08:11:33] <mikesherov> addoyle: nice!
[08:12:48] <ryanneufeld> addoyle: HIGH FIVE!
[08:12:50] <addoyle> mikesherov: i'm not sure what's the best way to test, but i think if we can change some texts to varchars, we can do better
[08:13:12] <mikesherov> addoyle: yes
[08:13:19] <mikesherov> I'm afraid of that though
[08:13:37] <mikesherov> I can imagine we can get away with varchar 255
[08:13:38] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: depending on the fields it should be okay
[08:13:45] <mikesherov> sure
[08:13:55] <mikesherov> just saying I'm scared of it, not that it's a bad idea :-)
[08:14:48] <addoyle> i guess we can start with just changing the fields that are indexed
[08:14:50] <Rwhitbeck> ajpiano https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/135
[08:16:53] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: yeah, changing datatypes is scary stuff.

[08:26:28] <rascalking> http://oksoclap.com/jquery-summit-triage
[08:29:21] <james_morrin> i'm sorry I cant take the music any more.. if anyone is interested... http://turntable.fm/jquery_developer_summit
[08:30:23] <JonahSchulte> ooh, thanks James
[08:35:24] <zjs> james_morrin: cool... what would it take to replace whatever device is currently being used to play the music with something connected to turntable.fm? (it looks cool and I think anything would be better than the elevator tunes that are currently playing)
[08:36:21] <james_morrin> zjs: if anyone has an android device or an IOS device.. They could download the turntable app and plug it into the audio system
[08:37:02] <JonahSchulte> I think that would be ideal
[08:37:19] <zjs> Do we know who's currently controlling the music? I'd sacrifice my phone for the day.
[08:37:38] <cloudbrows> Devs don't like jazz, huh?
[08:38:50] <ajpiano> zomg guys
[08:39:13] <ajpiano> i thought jazz would be safe, i can go back to playing 2 week old indie rock
[08:39:14] <ajpiano> :p
[08:39:49] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: Can you please look at https://github.com/kswedberg/api.jquery.com/commit/a1fee71e295dc311f985abb807d587808ebc39f2 and lemme know if the changes look fit for print?
[08:40:34] <JonahSchulte> jazz isn't bad but in my experience it's more fun when everyone contributes to the playlist
[08:40:36] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I'm getting vertigo, I feel like I'm in an elevator
[08:40:41] <JonahSchulte> I've done it with a Spotify shared playlist before and that worked really well
[08:40:55] <cloudbrows> I think the jazz is classy. :P
[08:41:05] <ajpiano> spotify shared playlist would be great, i'll set one up
[08:41:10] <ajpiano> cloudbrows: ya
[08:41:12] <ryanneufeld> nice
[08:41:37] <JonahSchulte> sweet
[08:42:13] <cloudbrows> get ready for non-stop skrillex
[08:42:14] <cloudbrows> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1RRslsFxA
[08:42:41] <JonahSchulte> haha
[08:42:46] <ajpiano> yea that's kind of my concern
[08:42:54] <ajpiano> well, we'll give it a shot :p
[08:42:56] <ajpiano> http://open.spotify.com/user/ajpiano/playlist/7jj0bQJ1weFoe7gT3Ozwjl
[08:43:32] <JonahSchulte> thanks ajpiano!
[08:43:59] <ajpiano> zjs ryanneufeld and any other tastemakers ^^
[08:45:22] <ajpiano> wow took 2 mins for our first [EXPLICIT] tag
[08:45:25] <ajpiano> >:|
[08:46:16] <ajpiano> thx james_morrin :p
[08:46:40] <james_morrin> ajpiano: didnt realize what I was doing :)
[08:47:13] <ronchalant> anybody find that building the /jquery/jquery.com site with grunt now fails on lint, wanting "use strict"?
[08:47:25] <ronchalant> I hand-edited it locally to get it to go, but I don't think I had to yesterday
[08:47:33] <ajpiano> ronchalant: yeah, it's a known issue that just happened cause of hte grunt 0.3.17 release
[08:47:50] <ajpiano> we might want to go through and add the "use strict" to all our gruntfiles
[08:47:53] <ronchalant> cool ok.. just making sure I didn't mess something up
[08:48:36] <ajpiano> gonna file an issue for the summit
[08:48:44] <ajpiano> ya, i just found out about it 20 mins ago
[08:48:58] <ronchalant> cool.. you can assign it to me if you want @ronchalant..
[08:49:02] <ronchalant> site-build table
[08:51:58] <ajpiano> will do!
[08:53:29] <JonahSchulte> crank up the tunes! haha
[08:55:30] <jzaefferer> johnkpaul scott_gonzalez: now? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/72
[08:56:09] <ajpiano> this is the hardest part of my job now lol
[08:56:29] <johnkpaul> jzaefferer: sure
[08:58:21] <ajpiano> JonahSchulte: nice pickin on series add there, i found them from the shins tribute a few weeks ago
[08:58:41] <JonahSchulte> sweet :)
[08:58:48] <JonahSchulte> pickin on is awesome
[08:59:31] <timmywil> http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#file-upload-state-(type=file)
[09:08:45] <elgreg> https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/issues/28
[09:12:18] <Rwhitbeck> Social experiment idea tweet the shared playlist to @jquery and see what we get.
[09:12:28] <Rwhitbeck> @ajpiano ^ ;-)
[09:12:41] <JonahSchulte> haha
[09:12:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what are we doing about grunt 0.3.17?
[09:13:48] <couchand> anybody have a puzzle or cube or something for me to fiddle with while debugging?
[09:14:10] <gnarf> JonahSchulte: nice picks
[09:14:14] <gnarf> JonahSchulte: ++talking heads :)
[09:15:05] <JonahSchulte> :)
[09:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We'll figure it out tonight.
[09:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like it's going to be a huge pain.
[09:16:52] <JonahSchulte> This looks cool: https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted
[09:19:27] <adrocknaphobia> Not as cool as http://github.com/adobe/brackets :-P
[09:19:53] <james_morrin> adrocknaphobia: they have AMD support in the code hinting :)
[09:20:32] <adrocknaphobia> all in due time.
[09:20:33] <elgreg> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/issues/66 is the issue - looks like it's already in infrastructure
[09:21:27] <ryanneufeld> elgreg: yes, you could assign it to yourself
[09:22:11] <elgreg> dont' think I have access to do that - but assume someone at my table does.
[09:22:45] <adrocknaphobia> (btw. I have a bunch of Brackets and HTML5 stickers here)
[09:22:47] <Wilto> Is this _pirate rap_?
[09:22:51] <Wilto> Is that what I’m hearing here?
[09:23:26] <JonahSchulte> arr matey
[09:24:28] <Wilto> And now “sail.” There’s a theme.
[09:24:38] <james_morrin> (I say yo you say ho... yo)   Kinda stuck in my head now!!
[09:25:39] <ryanneufeld> adrocknaphobia: I would like some HTML5 stickers
[09:25:43] <ryanneufeld> where can I find you?
[09:25:55] <adrocknaphobia> Table 5.
[09:26:04] <johnkpaul> scott_gonzalez: the changes to grunt jquery content are working correctly
[09:26:05] <ryanneufeld> wave
[09:26:39] <johnkpaul> how do you recommend that I make this pull request on both grunt jquery content and learn.jquery.com?
[09:26:42] <johnkpaul> to keep the versions in sync?
[09:27:38] <ajpiano> you just make the pr on grunt-jquery-content
[09:27:51] <ajpiano> when the new version is released, we just bump the version the package.json for learn.jquery.com
[09:28:15] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: but there are code changes necessary in web-base-template
[09:33:24] <Wilto> Shout-out to The Wizard soundtrack.
[09:34:48] <couchand> hey any githeads out there?
[09:34:56] <couchand> can i diff against the top of my stash stack?

[10:45:49] <bchiasson> james_morrin: it is indeed
[10:46:53] <bchiasson> gnarf: not solved
[10:47:04] <bchiasson> grunt is outputting an error saying that phantom is not there
[10:47:34] <bchiasson> but i can execute phantom anywhere in terminal
[10:49:06] <bchiasson> i have reset Terminal
[10:49:45] <elgreg> bchiasson: new window terminal, etc?
[10:50:57] <bchiasson> elgreg: new terminal window
[10:51:08] <elgreg> bchiasson: what table are you at?
[10:51:09] <bchiasson> found the issue, installed with npm without -g
[10:51:23] <bchiasson> someone at the table suggested adding the g
[10:51:23] <Rwhitbeck> Beegees?  Really?
[10:51:27] <elgreg> bchiasson: ah so. that'd do it.
[10:51:38] <bchiasson> that didn't work
[10:51:48] <bchiasson> so i removed the npm_modules directory from the parent
[10:51:58] <bchiasson> then reset terminal
[10:52:00] <bchiasson> that fixed it
[10:52:48] <bchiasson> we are all good, thanks everyone

[12:05:50] <ronchalant> for documentation purposes, anybody get through a "virgin" install of libxslt & libxml2 to support grunt builds on a Windows machine?  want to document any potential pitfalls or challenges people might have
[12:06:13] <ronchalant> and we opted not to just add in an apple.com link directing windows users to buy a mac
[12:06:48] <ryanneufeld> nvm, gnarf is back

[12:08:57] <zjs> ronchalant: if you're set on not linking to apple.com, did you consider pointing them to download instructions for virtual box + a linux distro?
[12:09:09] <ronchalant> lol

[12:46:46] <morgan> I have a questions for the foundation. I'd like to see some metrics on the success of the weekend activities. Things like we started out with X number of bugs and closed out Y number. There were X number of pull requests, Y were accepted. Is that something that can be done for the last talking points?
[12:48:12] <JonahSchulte> +1
[12:49:42] <couchand> it would mean scott_gonzalez would have to get to triaging his inbox full of pull requests
[12:52:44] <couchand> ben_alman: do you know a resource that would update the event delegation info from that article?
[12:52:53] <couchand> all the references to live seem stale

[15:35:50] <zjs> Anyone staying at the doubletree interested in grabbing dinner or hanging out this evening?
[15:38:12] <JonahSchulte> There is a rumor of there being food on the 6th floor
[15:39:04] <zjs> I didn't even realize there _was_ a 6th floor.
[15:39:20] <zjs> (I thought the elevator had L and 1-5.)
[15:39:33] <JonahSchulte> it…does :)
[15:39:38] <zjs> Good to know.
[15:39:48] <zjs> Is there a time and/or organizer associated with said food?
[15:39:51] <JonahSchulte> you have to say the magic password and then "6" appears as an option in the elevator
[15:40:19] <JonahSchulte> unknown, I got a text saying "food on 6th floor"
[15:40:30] <JonahSchulte> so we may want to investigate that
[15:40:50] <JonahSchulte> I know you have to swipe your card to make the elevator go to that floor but haven't tried my card yet
[15:41:19] <zjs> Interesting.
[15:41:26] <JonahSchulte> going to give that a try now
[15:45:08] <JonahSchulte> update: I am in the elevator :-p
[15:45:24] <JonahSchulte> card worked
[15:45:38] <JonahSchulte> I am ascending
[19:10:35] <gnarf> 6th floor loby
[19:10:43] <gnarf> we's here again
