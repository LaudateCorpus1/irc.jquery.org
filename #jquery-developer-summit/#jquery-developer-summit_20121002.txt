[11:37:48] <clarkbox> everyone, please welcome jqlog!
[11:39:02] <Wilto> Whatup, jqlog.
[12:45:52] <ajpiano> Wilto: there are still some more folks straggling in
[13:53:36] <agcolom> ajpiano: are we ok for the bowling or do we need to book as well?
[14:22:03] <ajpiano> agcolom: we need to book as well
[14:22:07] <ajpiano> did you not receive an invite last night?
[14:30:50] <agcolom> Sorry, I missed it. Got it now! Thanks!

[14:34:44] <ajpiano> johnkpaul gnarf clarkbox agcolom scott_gonzalez rxaviers timmywil uGoMobi Wilto ryanneufeld thoughts ^^ ?
[14:34:54] <ajpiano> i realise you all probably got an e-mail about that too :x
[14:35:55] <gnarf> ajpiano: thoughts in github
[14:35:58] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I'm a +1 on that
[14:35:59] <gnarf> seems smart play
[14:38:51] <johnkpaul> is the other option to use those other repos' alredy existing issues?
[14:39:04] <ajpiano> the other option was to just kind of slam it all in the wiki
[14:39:14] <ajpiano> aka Ask For Trouble™
[14:40:09] <johnkpaul> ah, well then, yes, I am for asking for not trouble
[14:40:18] <johnkpaul> perhaps Clue™ would be nice
[14:40:26] <johnkpaul> or maybe Mouse Trap™
[15:02:32] <ryanneufeld> It was ajpiano in the recording booth with a unicorn hat
[15:02:46] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: will the unicorn hat be making an appearance?
[15:03:12] <ajpiano> maybe
[15:10:58] * Rwhitbeck waves to everyone
[15:12:08] <ajpiano> hi Rwhitbeck
