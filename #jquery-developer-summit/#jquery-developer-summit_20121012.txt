[10:13:50] <ajpiano> hey all, esp, team leads
[10:14:03] <ajpiano> about to send out a form asking everyone for their current status on env perparation
[10:14:10] <ajpiano> just so we can see how we're doing before monday
[10:14:22] <ajpiano> fyi
[10:34:16] <ryanneuf_> sounds good
[11:37:24] <DaveMethvin> plop, as jaubourg would say
[11:37:36] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez danheberden gnarf anyone, care to give this a quick once over https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGVZYUxubG5yQXpKbmk0dDVJU21GTGc6MQ
[11:37:42] <ajpiano> anything else i should ask
[11:37:55] <ajpiano> this is the last thing we get to send to people before we are actually in the same physical place as them
[11:38:04] <DaveMethvin> lol
[11:38:24] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: tested
[11:38:31] <DaveMethvin> i sure hope we don't get a lot of the last two
[11:38:38] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: perhaps have a table number for them?
[11:38:49] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: yeah, most of the people who are the last two, will probably not complete the form :p
[11:39:04] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: i had that in there but i didn't want it to be a quiz :p
[11:39:22] <ajpiano> but yeah, maybe i'll add it
[11:39:30] <ryanneufeld> in what sense would that make it a quiz?
[11:39:44] <ryanneufeld> if anything it will help those that know get help from their table lead
[11:39:50] <ryanneufeld> spread the load
[11:40:08] <ajpiano> because we already know what table they're at
[11:40:16] <ajpiano> this is just asking them if they know which table they're at
[11:40:16] <ajpiano> :p
[11:40:33] <ajpiano> but ya
[11:41:53] <ryanneufeld> well, what if *they* dont
[11:42:01] <ajpiano> exactly
[11:42:16] <ryanneufeld> "I'm not sure" would be a perfectly valid answer
[11:42:30] <ajpiano> not really
[11:42:36] <ryanneufeld> it's not like they're gonna be shunned for not knowing their table number?
[11:42:49] <ajpiano> i mean, it's perfectly valid, but it's not a good sign :p
[11:42:50] <ryanneufeld> or maybe...no... no... but...
[11:43:54] <ajpiano> refresh to see it updated
[11:46:54] <ryanneufeld> looks okay to me
[11:51:49] <danheberden> ajpiano: nice
[11:52:06] <ajpiano> ok, i'm lettin 'er rip
[11:55:20] <Wilto> do what now
[12:00:15] <gnarf> ajpiano: i submitted my response
[12:00:32] <ajpiano> very useful
[12:00:39] <ajpiano> :D
[12:27:56] <ajpiano> JonahSchulte: sorry about the confusion about the vagrant stuff
[12:28:43] <ajpiano> that page is gone now :p
[12:29:30] <ajpiano> you may or may not need a local webserver, but that's either as simple as MAMP and friends, or something as simple as python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[12:32:23] <JonahSchulte> hey ajpiano, no problem!
[12:32:29] <JonahSchulte> Just wasn't sure if I would need that or not
[12:32:45] <JonahSchulte> And MAMP is no problem, just wanted to point out that it wasn't super clear on the setup page from what I could see
[12:32:54] <JonahSchulte> and was thinking others might have issues with that but I think I am all set
[12:34:18] <ajpiano> yah, i hear that
[14:47:18] <kpepin> Hi folks.
[15:11:17] <ajpiano> hey kpepin !
[15:20:02] <kpepin> Hi ajpiano.  :)  Just tryign to get everything setup on my laptop for the summit.
[15:20:59] <kpepin> I am feeling like a total n00b at the moment.  My company is very much behind the curve when it comes to developing JavaScript based applications, and a lot of the tools we'll be using are relatively new to me as a result (though I'm looking forward to working with them).
[15:21:27] <kpepin> I've heard of all of the tools, but in a lot of ways this will be the first time I'm workign with them.
[15:34:22] <kpepin> Hi Peter
[15:45:40] <kpepin> See you at the summit.
