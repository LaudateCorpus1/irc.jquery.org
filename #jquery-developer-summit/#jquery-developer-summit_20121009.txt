[08:12:15] <arschmitz> Wilto: Was wondering what you do when your attempting to fix a bug or trace it down as far as builds do you do a new local build with the changes each time? or is there some easier way?
[08:13:31] <Wilto> “Builds,” you say.
[08:14:41] <arschmitz> like making changes and putting all back into one big js file maybe build isnt the right word
[08:14:42] <Wilto> No local buildin’ here. The process is “create a bug-specific branch, attempt a fix [ x 1000], find a fix, rebase into master.”
[08:15:20] <arschmitz> right i mean just for testing and debugging after making the branch before your done
[08:15:56] <arschmitz> ii might not be explainging my self well
[08:16:08] <Wilto> We don’t run any kind of build script, if that’s what you’re asking.
[08:16:46] <arschmitz> ok so what do you just attach all the seperate .js files in the head?
[08:24:07] <arschmitz> guess im confused lo,l
[08:27:35] <arschmitz> nevermind i figured it out just being stupid
