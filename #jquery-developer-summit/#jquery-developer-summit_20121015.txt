[06:42:03] <JonahSchulte> :)
[06:42:05] <gseguin> can we invite bot-t to the channel?
[06:42:13] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: we've tried
[06:42:30] <eTiger13> i miss bot-t already
[06:42:46] <jaubourg> OH HAI
[06:42:54] <timmywil> jaubourg: hai~
[06:43:21] <ryanneufeld> Can someone let Dave know to speak into the mic?
[06:43:30] <ryanneufeld> there we go
[06:43:32] <ryanneufeld> :)
[06:45:23] <toddmparker_> Hey-o
[06:45:35] <toddmparker_> There in spirit
[06:45:40] <JonahSchulte> Hey Todd
[06:45:58] <Wilto> ah yo whatup
[06:46:13] <jaubourg> hi Todd :)
[06:46:34] <scottjehl__> Hi-o
[06:46:51] <toddmparker_> hey all
[06:46:56] <eTiger13> uh oh notifications are on for dave
[06:47:01] <toddmparker_> so Dave is doing an intro now?
[06:47:05] <JonahSchulte> yes
[06:47:12] <toddmparker_> HI EVERYBODY!
[06:47:18] <JonahSchulte> Talking about jQuery 1.9 + 2.0
[06:47:26] <toddmparker_> ah, cool
[06:47:28] <ryanneufeld> HI TODDPARKER!!
[06:47:35] <petro> OMG HAI
[06:47:45] <danheberden> ERRMAHGERD
[06:47:47] <Wilto> toddmparker_: What’s up, bruh.
[06:47:52] <toddmparker_> I was hoping that was projected for the world to see on Dave's laptop
[06:48:15] <Wilto> We’ll set it up, Wizard of Oz style.
[06:48:15] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: that would have been awesome, but no, it did not happen :(
[06:48:16] <JonahSchulte> if you email him that should do the trick ;)
[06:48:36] <petro> todd you could do it if you edit the presentation slides on google docs right now ;)
[06:49:26] <JonahSchulte> haha, nice
[06:49:27] <gseguin> hey toddmparker_
[06:49:44] <Wilto> I’m privately scheming ways that we can steal some folks to work on jQuery Mobile docs. Nobody tell anybody.
[06:50:05] <toddmparker_> Your secret is safe with me
[06:50:09] <JonahSchulte> Real subtle Wilto
[06:50:11] <JonahSchulte> :)
[06:50:11] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[06:50:12] <Wilto> Sweet.
[06:50:24] <toddmparker_> so is the entire conference on this channel?
[06:50:31] <kpepin> Hi Todd...  just three of us at table 15 today.  Look forward to workign with you tomorrow.
[06:50:43] <Wilto> DAMMIT DANHEBERDEN
[06:50:46] <toddmparker_> hi kpepin - nice to meet you
[06:50:48] <ryanneufeld> HAHAHA
[06:51:22] <Wilto> Right okay also stealing more people for table 15.
[06:51:32] <toddmparker_> is the plan to use the respective -dev IRC channels for coordination? or channels per table?
[06:51:52] <petro> ALL YOUR SPACES ARE BELONG TO RICK
[06:52:09] <gseguin> I think that's a good idea toddmparker_, 'cause it might get noisy in here
[06:52:11] <eTiger13> all in one channel for chaos
[06:52:19] <JonahSchulte> In theory everyone is in here
[06:52:26] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: this is the official one for the summit, what each table chooses is up to to them
[06:52:27] <eTiger13> ugh. what is up with my username :(
[06:52:33] <JonahSchulte> though I heard we were going to try talking to each other like humans, in person. kind of terrifying
[06:52:38] <JonahSchulte> :)
[06:52:42] <danheberden> damnit ajpiano you made him turn it off before mine got through
[06:52:45] <ryanneufeld> JonahSchulte: BLASPHEMER!!!
[06:52:52] <JonahSchulte> I know!
[06:54:26] <petro> @table 10 (UI widgets): #jqds-ui-widgets
[06:54:44] <Wilto> toddmparker_: I think the plan is that we’re all coordinating in here.
[06:54:58] <eddiemonge> im liking the SW references
[06:55:10] <Wilto> And, y’know, by throwing “45,000 hours of free AOL” CDs at each other.
[06:55:23] <petro> someone get the poor guy a lasso tool
[06:55:48] <Wilto> toddmparker_, you’re gonna be psyched: Developer Summit sweatbands.
[06:56:00] <addoyle> woo sweatbands
[06:56:08] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: looks like john macenroe
[06:57:15] <fracmak> we need musical interlude music
[06:57:39] <james_morrin> we should start a side turntable room :)
[06:57:43] <petro> +1
[06:57:50] <JonahSchulte> good call
[06:58:17] <morgan> Inspirational Music - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFEoMO0pc7k
[06:58:52] <fracmak> what, no rick rolling? I'm dissapointed
[06:58:52] <fracmak> ;)
[06:59:18] <Krinkle> Good morning
[06:59:24] <ryanneufeld> Alo
[06:59:29] <petro> there was the web before jquery UI?
[06:59:31] <petro> o_O
[07:00:09] <ryanneufeld> petro: even weirder, there was internet before broadband....
[07:00:12] <ryanneufeld> so weird
[07:00:51] <james_morrin> i thought the internet before broadband was AOL?
[07:01:06] <petro> but then how would you have uploaded videos to facebook back then?
[07:01:20] <ryanneufeld> I used to think AOL was a free coaster service
[07:01:22] <james_morrin> petro you had to mail them in on VHS
[07:01:24] <rascalking> the internet before broadband was prodigy
[07:01:40] <rascalking> yes, the band
[07:01:52] <james_morrin> fire starter...
[07:01:53] <ryanneufeld> prodigy FTMFW

[07:05:46] <[1]bavanyo> hola
[07:06:04] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Is there a roster for today/tomorrow? (e.g. the presentations currently going on)
[07:06:17] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: not sure
[07:07:35] <DaveMethvin> .
[07:08:46] <jaubourg> ..
[07:08:54] <Krinkle> bmcmurray: Is your environment all up and running?

[07:12:34] <danheberden> pm'd
[07:14:32] <adrocknaphobia> For anyone working on UI/Touch, I brought a Win8 tablet if needed for testing.
[07:15:06] <dnschnur> These changes just eliminated about 80% of the boilerplate that I currently have to add to most of my widgets!
[07:15:06] <eddiemonge> what if i want to test it in general?
[07:15:28] <morgan> browserstack.com
[07:15:46] <Krinkle> ^ what he said
[07:16:16] <toddmparker_> browserstack is the best
[07:16:36] <toddmparker_> do we have a way to "loan" access to BS for summit folks?
[07:16:39] <james_morrin> adrocknaphobia mind if I just come take a look at the tablet? I've been curious about the win8 tablets. :)
[07:17:17] <eddiemonge> i meant test the win8 tablet itself
[07:17:34] <eddiemonge> ^^ what james_morrin said
[07:17:56] <eddiemonge> win8 tablets have actually got me excited about windows. what and win phone 8.
[07:18:13] <adrocknaphobia> you can use it for whatever.
[07:18:31] <james_morrin> I saw a nokia win phone in the wild.. its pretty cool. I use to love nokia phones.. :)
[07:18:49] <Wilto> Shout-out to MeeGo.
[07:18:50] <zjs> Is there a page describing the basic development environment setup we should do to be productive today/tomorrow? (I thought I saw a "do these things before you show up" list somewhere, but I can't seem to find it.)
[07:18:56] <toddmparker_> If you are here to help out on mobile, please hop into #jquerymobile-dev and introduce yourself. We'll find out your interests and what you'd like to learn/work on and pair you up with a team member to get you up to speed
[07:19:02] <toddmparker_> Also, hi!
[07:19:30] <toddmparker_> Wilto: we need to make a list right now of the devices you and Scott brought
[07:19:38] <morgan> @ zjs - https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki
[07:20:21] <Wilto> Sure thing. toddmparker_. I have the full list of test thingies at https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki/Table-14:-Mobile-Bugs
[07:20:33] <Wilto> We can just pare that down to the ones that, y’know, actually exist here.
[07:26:01] <toddmparker_> perfect
[07:26:17] <toddmparker_> we need a system for tracking these
[07:26:26] <Wilto> Friggin’ love Grunt.
[07:26:43] <DanBowles> Same
[07:26:49] <JonahSchulte> +1
[07:26:53] <toddmparker_> for now, I'd suggest that we keep 'em all at one table and assign a person to watch them
[07:26:58] <Wilto> toddmparker_: I’m thinking the triage table is the Keeper of the Phones
[07:27:00] <Wilto> Yep, exactly.
[07:27:01] <jaubourg> rwaldron: need to talk to you about making this grunt-update-submodule repo
[07:27:05] <toddmparker_> cool
[07:27:06] <Wilto> Plus I’ll break thumbs; straight up.
[07:27:37] <Wilto> gseguin: You cool with being Executive in Charge of All The Phones?
[07:27:38] <toddmparker_> so uGoMobi, _|Nix|_, gseguin, JasonDScott_ can rotate in and out as device monitors
[07:27:58] <gseguin> yeah sure
[07:28:34] <JonahSchulte> I brought an HTC Incredible running Android 2.3, original Kindle Fire, iPhone 4, Browser Stack and iOS Simulator
[07:29:24] <Wilto> Sweet. We’ve got all the FG ones labelled, and Scott Jehl slapped stickers on all of his.
[07:31:21] <JonahSchulte> nice
[07:31:55] <gseguin> I have an iPod touch 4th gen running iOS6
[07:32:29] <gseguin> and a Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.1.2
[07:33:33] <JonahSchulte> ah yes, my iPhone 4 is using iOS 6 as well
[07:35:02] <rascalking> gseguin: cm or the developer image from aosp?
[07:35:12] <rascalking> i've got a nexus 7, also running 4.1.2
[07:36:10] <gseguin> rascalking: CM10 nightly
[07:41:12] <dcarrith> ^ me too
[07:42:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: currently rebasing projects on origin/master (jquery/testswarm), wow we've done a lot in testswarm since then.
[07:42:33] <Krinkle> virtually every file conflicts horribly
[07:42:55] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: "we"? you mean at Wikimedia?
[07:43:07] <Krinkle> in general, commits and stuff done in testswarm
[07:43:20] <Krinkle> my branch has rotten
[07:43:26] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[07:47:29] <bavanyo> hey .. is there anyone from the los angeles meetup?
[07:50:33] <johnkpaul> is there a functions.php that is shared across all of the web base template's themes?
[07:50:59] <Krinkle> johnkpaul: Yes
[07:51:13] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template
[07:51:25] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/master/themes/jquery
[07:51:29] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: scroll down: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[07:51:50] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: or open directly http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/resources/easing-comparison.html
[07:51:58] <johnkpaul> Krinkle: ah ok, so jquery/functions.php is loaded for all of the subthemes?
[07:52:07] <Krinkle> I believe so, yes.
[07:52:12] <Krinkle> Its like the base theme
[07:52:17] <johnkpaul> got it
[07:52:30] <johnkpaul> add a function to get the path to the markdown page on github
[07:52:38] <johnkpaul> adding*
[07:52:41] <Krinkle> cool
[07:53:00] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: awesome! much better. :)
[07:53:04] <dmzza> works
[07:53:17] <danheberden> I'm disappointed
[07:53:25] <danheberden> kswedberg didn't highlight me in IRC
[07:53:29] <danheberden> while i was talking
[07:53:42] <kswedberg> hey danheberden: sorry man. :(
[07:53:48] <danheberden> i guess he only likes me on the other coast
[07:54:28] <couchand> woohoo nice open port

[08:08:13] <couchand> +1 for improving the music selection
[08:08:26] <timmywil> and agreed
[08:08:41] <JonahSchulte> Difficult to hear our fearless leader who is joining us VIA Facetime
[08:10:37] <james_morrin> yes music is horrible ! :)
[08:10:54] <james_morrin> we should just put the yayquery theme music on loop :)
[08:11:01] <JonahSchulte> yes please

[08:15:21] <couchand> big ups to jzaefferer for the first commit of #jqdevsummit
[08:15:48] <jzaefferer> couchand: heh, thanks. Been working on that demo over the last few days already
[08:16:33] <jzaefferer> ArtzStudio: irc://rocketsquared.com:7666/#jqds-ui-widgets
[08:17:18] <ben_alman> FYI the grunt channel is #grunt
[08:23:57] <danheberden> who is adding every team to issues?
[08:24:02] <danheberden> it makes it very confusing :/
[08:24:33] <Wilto> toddmparker_: Alright, so, looks like I’m heading up the general-purpose bugfixin’ table.
[08:25:12] <ronchala_> ronchalant - https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/issues/44
[08:32:05] <couchand> can someone give me a quick rundown on the purpose of jQuery.access()?
[08:32:45] <bmcmurray> Krinkle: https://join.me/ might work for screensharing to the rest of the table
[08:32:49] <eddiemonge> web-base group: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/74
[08:33:03] <kswedberg> nacin: Here is the issue: https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/issues/84
[08:33:13] <kswedberg> it wouldn't let me assign the issue to you.
[08:43:42] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12694 : "Hello. I'm Japanese"
[08:46:02] <timmywil> http://jsbin.com/avalow/1/
[08:49:35] <DavidSouther> @mikesherov that's actually not a bad bug report
[08:57:12] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7442
[08:57:56] <kswedberg> danheberden: can you give eddiemonge privs on api.jquery.com repo so he can close issues? He has privs on other repos already.
[09:00:48] <timmywil> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues?state=open
[09:03:43] <danheberden> kswedberg: aye
[09:04:08] <danheberden> boom done
[09:06:59] <kswedberg> danheberden: gracias!
[09:12:53] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=pending&report=303&order=id
[09:15:47] <eddiemonge> danheberden: can web-base reference a local jq for dev so it limits the number of external dependencies? would help here where google is taking 30+seconds to load jquery
[09:15:55] <eddiemonge> it could be set based on env
[09:16:34] <danheberden> eddiemonge: yeah, i think that's definitely possible. I actually think we should just build it in with the rest of our js
[09:16:40] <danheberden> and let people have that cache persist
[09:16:43] <danheberden> instead of the CDN
[09:16:47] <danheberden> but that's a discussion for later i'm sure
[09:31:33] <couchand> thank you DavidSouther for help getting npm running....
[09:31:44] <couchand> the real DavidSouther, not that faux DavidSouther1

[12:22:45] <johnkpaul> nacin: is there a way to use get_post to get all of the posts rather than only 5 at a time?

[13:07:59] <Krinkle> (without testswarm)

[13:12:47] <Rwhitbeck> DavidSouther, eTiger13 thanks I got help already.
[13:13:32] <Rwhitbeck> Wilto I LOL'd
[13:14:03] <Wilto> PUT ON NEON INDIAN

[13:20:35] <fracmak> where's the muzak??
[13:22:40] <johnkpaul> jzaefferer: looking into adding the suggestions/feedback link to the qunitjs template
[13:22:59] <johnkpaul> I don't understand how it's laid out
[13:23:03] <johnkpaul> there's no page.php
[13:23:30] <johnkpaul> oh, disregard, it just falls back to the one in templates/jquery
[13:30:13] <Wilto> What’s jquery
[13:34:33] <danheberden> koopersmith!
[13:34:35] <danheberden> ZOMG

[14:04:14] <Chexee> nacin: so all the content in blog posts (header, footer, tags, etc) are handled by markdown in github?
[14:04:49] <nacin> Chexee: not sure about titles. pretty sure those are converted to post_title
[14:04:58] <Wilto> Let me tell you guys what Neon Indian sounds like.
[14:05:12] <Chexee> nacin: hmm, okay.
[14:06:59] <Wilto> Neon Indian sounds like the self-composed soundtrack to someone’s Mega Man 3 fanfic, played on a half-broken garage sale keyboard.
[14:08:08] <couchand> Wilto: you really have a vendetta there
[14:08:13] <Chexee> I'm going to remove even more stuff and add some better descriptions no the doc blocks about where the content is being managed
[14:08:24] <jzaefferer> Krinkle gnarf mikesherov: What's the state of the art on testing branches? What's the easiest way to test a fork/branch on TestSwarm currently?
[14:08:56] <Wilto> Neon Indian sounds like someone spend weeks of their life circuit-bending a chorus of Furbies and recording the results on a Walkman, only to later discard the casette in a storm drain.
[14:09:06] <Wilto> couchand: I’m not a fan.
[14:09:16] <Chexee> nacin: what is content-api used for?
[14:09:38] <nacin> Chexee: get_template_part( 'content', 'api' ) in some of the api site themes
[14:10:36] <Chexee> got it
[14:13:30] <couchand> Wilto: tell us how you really feel
[14:13:37] <Wilto> they’re okay I guess
[14:13:45] <couchand> !!!
[14:14:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I guess the ball is currently in Jenkins' court
[14:14:41] <Krinkle> testswarm tests whatever it is given to path by sha1
[14:15:00] <Krinkle> so if jenkins is monitoring other branches as well, it'll just work'
[14:16:10] <Chexee> nacin: what's the difference between content-api and content-single-api?
[14:16:37] <Chexee> oh wait, nevermind I think
[14:16:47] <rworth> toekneestuck http://www.cardpartner.com/pro/app/jquery
[14:16:54] <Chexee> content-api shows api stuff in archives, etc?
[14:16:55] <nacin> Chexee: index/archive/search vs single?
[14:17:00] <Chexee> duh, me.
[14:17:45] <Rwhitbeck> rworth I am holding out for the jQuery Mobile card
[14:18:00] <rworth> Rwhitbeck we can create one, now that we have a logo
[14:18:47] <Wilto> DO IT
[14:18:55] <Wilto> —i mean uh that would be cool i guess
[14:19:19] <Wilto> Like I’d pass a credit check anyway.
[14:19:33] <Rwhitbeck> wilto me too :/
[14:19:51] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I want to have it test the Mask branch - should we create a new testswarm account for that, to separate it from the tests in master?
[14:20:35] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: That depends on whether we want to use the /user/jquery feed as a historical view.
[14:20:39] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: right now we don't
[14:20:46] <Krinkle> we use Jenkins to do that
[14:20:50] <Krinkle> (just like in jquery ui)
[14:20:59] <Krinkle> (which also mixes different sources of tests)
[14:21:04] <Krinkle> I'd say put it in the same account
[14:21:10] <jzaefferer> okay
[14:21:47] <Krinkle> if/when we switch away from Jenkins we'll have to either add a new dimension to testswarm feeds or make sure we get the history view elsewhere
[14:21:52] <Krinkle> probably on github
[14:22:20] <couchand> jzaefferer: is the process to let tickets close themselves with a post-commit hook?
[14:22:23] <Krinkle> Linking to the relevant job pages directly from the /commits list on github, /user/jquery would just be a global view of recent jobs
[14:22:31] <couchand> is there a status to indicate the pull request has been submitted?
[14:23:36] <jzaefferer> couchand: yeah, just follow the commit message guideline
[14:25:07] <couchand> jzaefferer: the docs aren't exactly clear on the relationship between trac, github forks and pull requests
[14:25:38] <couchand> i'm looking at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137724/Bug%20Fixing%20Guide
[14:25:52] <couchand> reading this line: "Submit a pull request after your commit and add a link to your commit in a comment on the ticket."
[14:26:41] <couchand> it probably would be helpful to explicitly say "leave as open" or "leave as assigned" or whatever the desired status is
[14:27:35] <couchand> (since post-commit hooks don't work on a fork....)
[14:30:40] <jzaefferer> couchand: once its merged trac notices it and looks at the commit message, or something like that
[14:31:14] <couchand> jzaefferer: ah that makes sense.  so it's just sort of in purgatory until the pull request is reviewed?
[14:31:25] <jzaefferer> couchand: added a clarification to that page
[14:32:29] <couchand> jzaefferer: thanks!
