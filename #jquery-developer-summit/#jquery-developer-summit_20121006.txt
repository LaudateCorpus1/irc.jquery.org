[07:53:44] <dnschnur> I have my dev env set up (thanks to ajpiano and gnarf) but I'm seeing a lot of PHP notices; mainly accessing properties of nulls.  Do you guys typically run with ~E_NOTICE, or are these indicative of an actual problem?
[17:35:07] <bob_holt> ajpiano - around?
[17:37:06] <bob_holt> or Rwhitbeck?
[17:37:22] <Rwhitbeck> hi
[17:37:26] <bob_holt> howdy
[17:37:48] <Rwhitbeck> I assume a Table 5 question?
[17:37:55] <bob_holt> you got it
[17:38:08] <bob_holt> just wondering for table 5 if I should fork web-base-template or if a read-only is good enough
[17:39:04] <Rwhitbeck> probably just read-only.  I assume we'll only deal with the content which I think is in another repo.
[17:39:20] <Rwhitbeck> I am still getting the content set up on my machine.
[17:39:41] <Rwhitbeck> ajpiano can provide more info though when he comes back.
[17:40:08] <bob_holt> cool. it's easy enough to change, but figured i'd go ahead and check. thanks.
