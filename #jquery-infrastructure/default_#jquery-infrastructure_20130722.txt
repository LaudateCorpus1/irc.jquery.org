[04:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: So it looks like we actually want to preserve casing everywhere, except when we check if a plugin name is taken.
[04:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> Here's what I've got: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/compare/name-casing
[04:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> I've tested the update script locally.
[04:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> Before I can run that in production, I need to write a script to remove a plugin version.
[04:28:43] <scott_gonzalez> So I can remove the offending plugin.
[04:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise the script will fail because it will try to create 2 entries with the same primary key since the new table is case insensitive.
[08:53:41] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: script looks good
[08:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for checking, s5fs.
[08:56:28] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: I saw your email re: shutting down ui-dev. i don't know anything about this host (?) but am happy to help
[08:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> There's probably no documentation for it. It's pretty old.
[08:58:57] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: gotcha, so we just need to purge dns and dump the site, yes? do we have an archival procedure or anything?
[09:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure.
[09:01:53] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: haha! well, i'm used to working with customers and often they'll have existing procedures to capture sites/data but that's usually for legal discovery.
[09:02:06] <s5fs> also, big enteprise hates to throw things away
[09:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> I want this site to die in a fire :-P
[09:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> I did not enjoy maintaining it.
[09:02:56] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: gotcha
[09:03:51] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: how about api-dev.jquery.com ?
[09:04:07] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i'll poke at gnarf and rdworth to see if i can get my arms around the problem.
[09:04:21] <s5fs> agcolom: hello!
[09:04:33] <agcolom> s5fs: Hi :-)
[09:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I didn't even know that existed.
[09:04:50] <agcolom> hang on, I've got a few more...
[09:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> We should kill that too, but check with DaveMethvin and kswedberg first.
[09:04:59] <agcolom> I'm mastering the google search ;-)
[09:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:05:09] <agcolom> http://wms.jquery.com/
[09:05:22] <s5fs> haha! i'm going to set aside time to review our public dns, i wonder if we've got more gems in there
[09:05:28] <agcolom> http://hotlink.jquery.com/
[09:05:41] <s5fs> good grief
[09:06:20] <agcolom> should I create a list of what I'm finding?
[09:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: Looking through DNS records sounds like a good idea.
[09:06:43] <agcolom> or would the dns show all those anyway?
[09:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Nah, s5fs's idea of looking through DNS will find all of them.
[09:06:56] <agcolom> cool!
[09:08:08] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I never knew api-dev.jquery.com existing. Or if I did, I've long since forgotten. So, yeah, kill it.
[09:08:37] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i'll open an issue and list any/all sites that seem funky. we can use this to create a clean-up list.
[09:08:48] <s5fs> kswedberg: noted
[09:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks s5fs.
[09:09:03] <kswedberg> s5fs: thanks!
[09:09:19] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: thanks for your patience, i feel like the most useless on the team to date, haha! but i gotta be honest, the js community in portland is doing awesome!
[09:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> Infrastructure seems like a tough thing to just hop into.
[09:11:04] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i'
[09:11:39] <s5fs> i've been doing systems a long time, i've broken a ton of stuff. i don't wish to show off my expertise in initiating failure until i'm confident i can reverse it ;-)
[09:12:01] <s5fs> much easier to submit one-off PRs for leading commas
[09:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> haha
