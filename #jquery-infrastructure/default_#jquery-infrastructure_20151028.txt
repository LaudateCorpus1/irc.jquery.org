[11:56:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i think we just email support@browserstack when we need help - but cc scott_gonzalez_ Krinkle kborchers - perhaps one of them has a direct contact to fit that bill
[12:35:37] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: gnarf: Yeah, we're in constant communication with them.
[12:36:26] <Krinkle> There's a CC-thread ongoing for a few years now with support@browserstack, one or two people @ browserstack, and a few of our folks.
[12:36:50] <Krinkle> There's rarely a week where there isn't something we report
[12:41:28] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: so they
[12:41:38] <ryanneufeld> 're not super stable is what you're saying?
[12:42:03] <Krinkle> well, no, I wouldn't say that. We've never reported down time that I can remember.
[12:42:28] * Krinkle looks for recent examples
[12:42:52] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:44:13] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: The vast majority are requests for new browser versions. m_gol tends to reach out on the day of stable release to make sure they give us notice when its added so we can add it to testswarm. 
[12:44:32] <ryanneufeld> that's not even an issue for us
[12:44:44] <Krinkle> They do tend to add it in a timely fashion without us asking.
[12:44:58] <ryanneufeld> we just want a recent enough version to do selenium tests w/ 
[12:45:04] <Krinkle> But we ask so that they tell us (e.g. "callback") when it's there so we don't waste time checking every day
[12:45:20] <m_gol> sometimes they lag, I usually notify them then
[12:45:29] <Krinkle> Yeah, sometimes it slips
[12:45:39] <Krinkle> But on the other hand, they do add beta versions too sometimes
[12:45:43] <Krinkle> so it's not too bad in practice
[12:45:54] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: You don't need to hardcode a version per se though, so you'll be fine there.
[12:46:37] <ryanneufeld> sability wise tho
[12:46:49] <ryanneufeld> never had any false failures of tests?
[12:47:02] <jzaefferer> no, there are issues with that
[12:47:07] <Krinkle> yeah.
[12:47:13] <jzaefferer> like java update popups killing focus or random timeouts
[12:47:24] <Krinkle> Sometimes they forget to close popups and such when updating VM images
[12:47:26] <jzaefferer> we report them, sometimes they come back anyway
[12:47:30] <ryanneufeld> none of that happens?
[12:47:35] <jzaefferer> but they're generally responsive and try to fix them
[12:47:38] <ryanneufeld> ah
[12:47:39] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:48:01] <Krinkle> They're very responsive, but it does seem like the bulk of our minor reports shouldn't need to be reported.
[12:48:13] <ryanneufeld> ok
[12:48:14] <jzaefferer> dunno if thats relevant to you, but their live testing UI improved massively over the years
[12:48:21] <Krinkle> Although I gotta hand it to them that it's a tough job.
[12:48:59] <ryanneufeld> granted it's tough, but it sounds like it's more stable than sauce
[12:49:12] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: What have you experienced with sauce labs that is unstable?
[12:49:45] <ryanneufeld> Random connection failures
[12:51:25] <ryanneufeld> downtime
[12:51:31] <ryanneufeld> usually it's just downtime
[12:51:44] <ryanneufeld> or it will stop responding while we're in the middle of our test
[12:51:46] <jzaefferer> I've never noticed browserstack being completely down
[12:52:10] <jzaefferer> maybe misattributed failures that were actually downtime though...
[12:52:27] <ryanneufeld> false negatives are our biggest problem
[15:47:26] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: When working with a third-party I generally don't have alerting go immediately though
[15:47:51] <Krinkle> e.g. either run twice or thrice and take median/best, or have alerting go after the second periodic run that fails.
[15:48:22] <Krinkle> What's what Wikimedia does for WebPageTest
[15:48:30] <Krinkle> We use a wrapper that takes the median of three runs, for example
[15:48:43] <Krinkle> since there is so much variance otherwise in the collected metrics
