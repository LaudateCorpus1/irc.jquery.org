[10:44:46] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez: i will deploy that script with -t today
[11:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: thanks
[13:47:23] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: whats up with this change: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/compare/699bfdaf7c71...7d2425c2751e was this fixing someones bug?
[13:48:12] <ryanneufeld> yeah, arschmitz wanted the html to be parsed by php on the jqm machines
[13:48:19] <ryanneufeld> so they could include a php file for the menu
[13:48:46] <ryanneufeld> I advised against it, but there was much winging about changing extensions, so I just did it.
[13:48:53] <ryanneufeld> did I break something?
[13:51:17] <gnarf> no
[13:51:23] <gnarf> just curious why
[13:51:25] <ryanneufeld> ok
[13:51:35] <ryanneufeld> I figured as much
[13:52:39] <ryanneufeld> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquerymobile-dev/%23jquerymobile-dev_20130120.log.html
[13:52:53] <ryanneufeld> if you search for my name about 75ish% through
[13:52:58] <ryanneufeld> you can see our convo
[14:08:46] <gnarf> danheberden: ping ping - did you upload the cert somewhere for me? i see noting about it on https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/140 cc @rworth

[15:09:18] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: that one line is all that needed to happen?
[15:12:06] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: that one line and a quick bit of code from scott_gonzalez
[15:12:16] <gnarf> to make his postreceive service serve the error log
[15:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which was also 1 line!
[15:12:57] <ryanneufeld> FML
[15:13:12] <ryanneufeld> I was staring at it crosseyed trying to figure out what the heck to do lol
[15:16:18] <gnarf> the other proxy is right there
[15:16:41] <gnarf> made more sense to just make the postreceive service serve its own error log than trying to setup another vhost
[15:17:30] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:22:07] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: if I wanted to log out any request that came into the notifier server, how would i do that
[15:22:07] <ryanneufeld> ?
[15:24:06] <ryanneufeld> nvm
[15:35:25] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: any clues https://gist.github.com/4615773 scott_gonzalez cc
[15:35:58] <gnarf> oh its a bug in my shit
[15:36:03] <gnarf> damnit
[15:36:18] <gnarf> the mailer config isn't there
[15:36:21] <gnarf> so it bombs out
[15:36:24] <gnarf> lemme fix it quick
[15:36:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah, but you have an if
[15:36:30] <ryanneufeld> that checks for it
[15:36:37] <ryanneufeld> so it shouldn't actually load should it?
[15:37:31] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: 4e5c139
[15:37:36] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: just pushed
[15:37:44] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: needs else { mailer = function(){}; }
[15:37:44] <gnarf> :)
[15:37:59] <ryanneufeld> OH
[15:42:17] <gnarf> yeah, i was setting that up as like a "load this shit or do nothing" but never added the else and never saw the bug because everywhere i use it has the mail config
[15:43:07] <ryanneufeld> so, basically this thing calls a script and passes the commitsh for the event?
[15:43:22] <ryanneufeld> also seems to shit the bed if you send it something un-expected
[15:43:28] <ryanneufeld> though that's scott_gonzalez's code :p
[15:43:39] <ryanneufeld> but thanks to him, I know what's going on
[15:43:44] <ryanneufeld> and I can fix it!
[15:43:54] <ryanneufeld> much <3 scott_gonzalez
[15:44:02] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yup
[15:44:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: like i said, this whole thing is like 100 lines of code :)
[15:44:39] <ryanneufeld> 100 or 1m
[15:44:48] <ryanneufeld> makes no diff to me if I don't grok what it's doing
[15:45:04] <ryanneufeld> I learn better when someone explains it
[15:45:08] <ryanneufeld> and then leaves me to it
