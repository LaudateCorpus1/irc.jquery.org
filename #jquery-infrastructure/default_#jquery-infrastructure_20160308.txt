[12:49:57] <s5fs> m_gol: sorry I missed your messages
[12:50:18] <s5fs> In the future, to run puppet on Codeorigin, run 'sudo puppet agent -t'
[12:50:24] <s5fs> or wait 30min
[13:53:32] <m_gol> s5fs: ok, I knew this is the way on swarm but I wanted to make sure it's OK to run it on codeorigin as well
[13:54:04] <s5fs> m_gol: it's safe to run on all puppet managed servers :D
[13:54:15] <m_gol> k :)
[13:54:24] <s5fs> and you have my phone number in case the world catches fire, yes?
