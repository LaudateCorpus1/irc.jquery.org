[09:18:26] <Krinkle> Hm.. this is a strange fail mode
[09:18:27] <Krinkle> https://blog.jquery.com/2015/04/28/jquery-1-11-3-and-2-1-4-released-ios-fail-safe-edition/
[09:18:33] <Krinkle> I guess https isn't supported but it's flawless
[09:18:37] <Krinkle> except the response is wrong
[15:50:43] <gnarf> Krinkle: I'm pretty sure the blog servers just don't have https setup
[15:51:03] <gnarf> and cloudflare assumes they will?
[15:52:29] <gnarf> it appears there is no way to turn that setting on or off for a single subdomain
[15:52:49] <gnarf> cc s5fs - want to try to work on that missing ssl tonight?
[15:53:24] <gnarf> Krinkle: same error here https://swarm.jquery.org/
[16:33:30] <s5fs> gnarf: I can't tonight but I can tomm (thurs)
[16:33:34] <s5fs> I'm golfing tonight, homie!
[16:33:54] <s5fs> Krinkle: you find the most interesting issues lol
[16:34:07] <Krinkle> :D
[16:34:14] <Krinkle> happy to be of service
[16:35:44] <s5fs> gnarf: additionally, we may be able to redirect https->http using 'page rules' on a per-domain basis
[16:35:51] <s5fs> er... per-host basis, whatever
[16:36:12] <gnarf> s5fs: tomorrow is a JS meetup @ bocoup
[16:36:14] <gnarf> boston js yo
[16:36:24] <gnarf> might find some time after tho
[16:37:18] <s5fs> i'll take a stab at it tomm during the day and see if can't at least get cloudflare to redirect requests for us
[16:37:38] <s5fs> i'll also review the ssl setup, can't be much different than the other wp servers
[16:39:30] <gnarf> yeah - it just needs the ssl cert puppeted over
[16:39:36] <gnarf> i think it should be easy
[16:39:45] <gnarf> swarm might even be easy
[16:39:45] <s5fs> agreed. if i get stuck i'll let ya know
[16:39:58] <gnarf> what I really want from cloudflare is "fallback" 
[16:40:08] <gnarf> https://www.cloudflare.com/a/crypto/jquery.com
[16:40:14] <gnarf> we have "full ssl" enabled
[16:40:19] <gnarf> which is correct for most subdomains
[16:40:25] <gnarf> what we really want is flexible
[16:40:42] <gnarf> but we want it to go full when https is avaialable
[16:41:19] <gnarf> like "in the event i forgot to setup ssl on this domain, let your proxy do it please"
[16:41:21] <gnarf> :)
[16:44:34] <s5fs> why not just terminate ssl at cf all the time?
[16:44:57] <gnarf> some sites (.org) want to force ssl anyway because of reasons 
[16:45:11] <gnarf> and i'd rather not have plaintext floating between the two endpoints
[16:45:19] <s5fs> i also wanna chat w/you about private dns, would be great to have some system to keep everything (private and public) synced up
[16:45:23] <gnarf> on a site that say takes a CC for a donation
[16:45:59] <gnarf> i'll accept private dns if it comes behind an openvpn server or something
[16:46:01] <gnarf> like
[16:46:04] <gnarf> connect to jquery vpn
[16:46:11] <gnarf> get the real host ips for shit
[16:46:15] <s5fs> local firewalling could help with a lot of concerns but i agree, we probably want to ensure truly private datat is encrypted between us and the client, no intermediary
[16:46:38] <s5fs> private dns is required, we can't publish all host records, we keep getting ddos'd.
[16:46:59] <s5fs> so yeah, its completely security thru obscurity, but we need to keep secrets, secret
[16:47:19] <gnarf> and if we don't put that dns server behind something authenticated
[16:47:20] <gnarf> ....
[16:47:31] <s5fs> i want a dns server that only we know about, so if ppl wanna configure their laptops to resolve dns using our little server, so be it
[16:47:40] <gnarf> firewalled from public, "internal only"
[16:47:45] <s5fs> well we can restrict who can query the dns server
[16:47:52] <gnarf> s5fs: if we use a vpn we can rewrite the dns server 
[16:48:12] <s5fs> ideally, yes. local firewall rules preventing non-jquery hosts from accessing the dns server.
[16:48:13] <gnarf> and also gain vpn / firewall advantages to the things that need to be behind 
[16:48:33] <s5fs> agreed, vpn may be our best best, and easiest for developers to grok. i just hate supporting vpns.
[16:48:48] <gnarf> agreed as well
[16:48:49] <gnarf> :)
[16:48:58] <gnarf> it's probably worth it though
[16:48:58] <s5fs> digital ocean has private networking, that's something we should be leveraging more as well.
[16:49:18] <s5fs> agreed. plus, supporting smart folks on vpn is much different than windows business users ;)
[16:49:33] <gnarf> s5fs: re private networking
[16:49:39] <gnarf> i think our uses here are limited for now
[16:49:49] <gnarf> i'd prefer to not tie us down to a single infrastructure setup
[16:50:44] <gnarf> like - "private network" options on DO are useful, but it means if we want to move one server off that network its suddenly tied to other servers that must move to a new private network as well
[16:51:45] <s5fs> well, i think about services like zabbix and figure that could be on a private network
[16:53:24] <s5fs> the only real difference is where we apply the firewall rules, and i'd rather keep them off the host, assuming the offloaded firewall is more performant
[16:53:34] <s5fs> bc when we get big traffic, it doesn't matter
[16:53:42] <s5fs> anyways gtg, i'll hit you up tomm. later tater(s)
