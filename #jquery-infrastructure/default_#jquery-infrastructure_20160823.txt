[15:07:26] <Krinkle>  [infrastructure] dmethvin opened issue #404: Several production sites not deploying https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/404
[15:07:32] <Krinkle> Aye, still an issue.
[15:07:38] <Krinkle> Not sure what to do about it.

[15:53:22] <Krinkle> gnarf: Seems like the server runs an older version of notifier that uses simple-log. Your latest github uses debug() instead.
[16:47:43] <Krinkle> s5fs: Why was node downgraded from v4 to 0.12 on builder-01? That seems to be one of the main differences between the working builder (stage.jq02) and the broken one (builder-01)
[16:49:01] <Krinkle> Right that was for https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/398
[16:49:09] <Krinkle> because download.jqueryui.com doesn't support newer Node
