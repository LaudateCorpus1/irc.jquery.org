[05:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks Krinkle|detached.
[05:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: I totally forgot that PHP added type hinting.
[09:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around?
[09:43:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: somewhat
[09:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> Can you setup the MediaWiki redirects?
[09:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/23#issuecomment-22234849
[09:44:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i saw the issue comment from krinkle - looked good, I can test it, kinda want to see if maybe s5fs / ryanneufeld wants to either watch me do it or do it with my watchings
[09:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:03:33] <s5fs> gnarf: i like watchin' stuff
[10:04:20] <s5fs> btw "KrinkleMac" sounds like a fancy bar food
[10:06:24] <gnarf> s5fs: so the plan here is going to be to make one of the main servers (probably the wordpress one) generate a nginx config that includes all of those rewrites with a final default rewrite of http://learn.jquery.com/
[10:09:02] <s5fs> gnarf: okay, I see the rewrites in question, except for the default
[10:09:53] <s5fs> generating the config is an automated process?
[10:10:09] <gnarf> s5fs: puppet it
[10:10:28] <gnarf> s5fs: i think most of the pieces we already need are here
[10:11:10] <s5fs> okay i think i follow :)
[10:11:43] <gnarf> s5fs: skype?
[10:11:56] <gnarf> 5 min?
[10:11:58] <s5fs> sure, adam.ulvi

[11:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> Should that have been in puppet-stage first?

[11:32:56] <gnarf> i'll rebase you under me on stage
[11:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry.
[11:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't realize you were using branches to manage environments.

[11:38:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems to be working
[11:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> What's left on eol3?
[11:41:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not sure - cc s5fs
[11:42:49] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: looks like planet.jquery.com and *.plugins.jquery.com
[11:42:54] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/DNS-AXFR updated
[11:44:20] <gnarf> wtf is planet - cc rworth
[11:44:25] <gnarf> i think you knew?
[11:44:42] <rworth> it's a blog agreggator
[11:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> Why are we running that?
[11:45:26] <rworth> http://www.planetplanet.org/
[11:46:16] <rworth> one of the first contributions I ever made to jQuery, and I'm quite certain it's never been touched since http://planet.jquery.com/
[11:46:35] <s5fs> haha!
[11:46:53] <rworth> you can see just how old it is based on who's blogs we had in there
[11:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> Can we kill it?
[11:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like we have analytics on it.
[11:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Though presumably RSS activity is the only thing going on here, not actual visitors to the site.
[11:48:03] <rworth> I think the number of people that want jQuery's blog mixed with that of Ariel, Benjamin, Brandon, Klaus, Marc Grabanski, Mike H, and Rey is quite low
[11:48:50] <gnarf> the other is archive.plugins
[11:48:53] <rworth> of course it wouldn't be their whole blogs, just those tagged jQuery, if they provided a filtered feed
[11:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> So can we just take eol3 offline?
[11:51:53] <gnarf> i'm inclined to let it sit for a bit and be a backup machine
[11:52:01] <gnarf> but we could kill nginx on it
[11:52:20] <gnarf> in case we want to save any of the data from docs.jquery.com / need to look at it as it was
[11:52:43] <gnarf> archive.plugins.jquery.com .....
[12:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can we push the rewrites to production?
[12:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like they're only live in stage right now.
[12:03:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: your dns might be off
[12:03:48] <gnarf> ttls and all
[12:03:56] <gnarf> but i see redirects from docs
[12:04:04] <s5fs> i too see redirects from docs
[12:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, ok. That makes sense.
[12:07:34] <gnarf> so jq01 is finally starting to hit a cpu wall
[12:08:01] <gnarf> i think when i switch to SSL - this will get split into two machines
[12:08:18] <gnarf> jquery.com and everything else
[12:10:01] <gnarf> rworth: so that was a yes - we can kill planet?
[12:10:09] <rworth> worksforme
[12:10:36] <gnarf> s5fs: eol3 isn't puppet managed, so can you remove /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/planet.jquery.com and restart it, plus remove the dns entry?
[12:11:08] <gnarf> so at this point, scott_gonzalez, we need to choose what to do with archive.plugins.jquery.com
[12:11:48] <gnarf> Krinkle|detached: what do i want to backup if we ever need to setup the mediawiki again / want to look at the data
[12:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Kill it.
[12:12:26] <s5fs> gnarf: no problem, doing it right now.
[12:14:30] <s5fs> gnarf: on eol3, should I remove docs.jquery.com and stage.docs from sites-enabled as well?
[12:14:49] <gnarf> s5fs: not yet, some dns might still point at it
[12:15:03] <gnarf> tomorrow, probably
[12:15:09] <s5fs> gnarf: okay i'll set a reminder for myself
[12:16:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20host%3Darchive.plugins.jquery.com%20status%3D200%20%7C%20top%20limit%3D1000%20uri_path&earliest=-24h%40h&latest=now
[12:17:53] <s5fs> gnarf: it's not symlinked so I just moved planet.jquery.com to sites-available "just in case"
[12:18:10] <gnarf> s5fs: good idea
[12:18:11] <gnarf> :)
[12:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> That's 24 hours?
[12:18:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[12:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> 1,300 views of jqDialog in 24 hours?
[12:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[12:19:03] <s5fs> popular!
[12:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> WTF. Why is robots.txt requested 1447 times in 24 hours?
[12:20:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lol: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20host%3Darchive.plugins.jquery.com%20status%3D200%20uri_path%3D%22%2Fproject%2FjqDialog%22%20%7C%20top%20limit%3D1000%20clientip&earliest=1375815600&latest=1375902981
[12:20:26] <arschmitz> just FYI: Noticed earlier that znc.jquery.com is still a page on old jquery.com complete with broken links to all the irc logs
[12:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this is all bogus info.
[12:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think real people are coming to this site.
[12:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20host%3Darchive.plugins.jquery.com%20status%3D200%20uri_path%3D%22%2Fproject%2F*%22%20%7C%20top%20limit%3D1000%20clientip&earliest=1375815600&latest=1375902981
[12:22:37] <gnarf> okay - i second the vote to axe it then, do we need a third? remove DNS for *.plugins and remove the site in apache?
[12:22:58] <s5fs> gnarf: planet.jquery.com has been removed and apache restarted. dns entry has been removed as well.
[12:23:07] <s5fs> I second removing *.plugins
[12:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> #2 IP is also to a single page.
[12:23:14] <s5fs> sorry, I third, I third
[12:23:44] <gnarf> lets just do it
[12:23:49] <gnarf> no time like the present
[12:24:37] <s5fs> gnarf: okay, I'm moving plugins.jquery.com from sites-enabled to sites-available and then restarting apache. OK?
[12:24:44] <gnarf> ++
[12:25:08] <s5fs> done.
[12:25:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: question
[12:25:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can the wordpress sync tools accept an IP and a hostname?
[12:25:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cuz if i set it up on multiple hosts, it might be nice to have it sync to both
[12:26:00] <s5fs> gnarf: I have to run, back in 30 or so.
[12:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Not sure. If you use an IP, it might not know which site ID to use.
[12:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> You thinking of load balanced web servers?
[12:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> Wouldn't they hit the same db?
[12:30:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe thats it
[12:30:50] * gnarf shrugs
[12:30:53] <b-ot> gnarf: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[13:40:36] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: whats your schedule like this week/weekend? I wanna get gnarf to train me on a few things and we were hoping you could join.
[13:40:53] <ryanneufeld> I'm pretty much MIA till next week
[13:41:02] <ryanneufeld> Family in town this week
[13:41:16] <ryanneufeld> and we just did our production release yesterday after a 3mo push
[13:41:25] <ryanneufeld> so couple days away from a screen are in order
[13:41:33] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: family - awesome!  launch - oh man, great work, super awesome!
[13:41:51] <ryanneufeld> family != awesome
[13:41:52] <ryanneufeld> but yeah
[13:41:54] <ryanneufeld> :P
[13:41:56] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: sounds like the fam being in town is well-timed, give you a legit excuse to detach for a bit
[13:42:02] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:42:04] <ryanneufeld> that it is
[13:42:35] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: how's next week look?
[13:42:56] <ryanneufeld> so far, less busy than this week
[13:43:19] <ryanneufeld> do you use IM at all?
[13:43:28] <s5fs> nah but i can
[13:43:33] <s5fs> what services are you on?
[13:43:43] <ryanneufeld> gtalk mostly
[13:43:49] <ryanneufeld> skype when someone asks me to
[13:44:30] <s5fs> cool, i have your info from jqcon, i just never use gtalk
[14:08:21] <ajpiano> so i can tweet about code.jquery.com now supporting https ?
[19:59:29] <Krinkle> gnarf: As for backup, everything is in /home/jqadmin/*_stage and *_live
[19:59:33] <Krinkle> on eol3
[19:59:52] <Krinkle> Of which 98% is in https://github.com/Krinkle/docs.jquery.com
[20:00:01] <Krinkle> so, kill it
[20:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around?
