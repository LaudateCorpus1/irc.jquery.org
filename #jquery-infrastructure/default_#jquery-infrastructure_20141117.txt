[07:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs gnarf: bugs.jqueryui.com isn't working.
[07:56:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: full disk
[07:56:37] <gnarf> checking on it
[07:59:42] <gnarf> deleted about 60 gigs of backups - rebooting server to hopefully get a clean restart
[08:04:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems back and working, confirm?
[08:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, thanks.
