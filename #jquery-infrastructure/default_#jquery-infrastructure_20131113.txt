[13:25:46] <Krinkle> gnarf: Is there an easy way to see when puppet last ran on a host (and perhaps more importantly, when it is scheduled to run next or even force it to run now). I found online documentation for these, but I'd rahter double check to make sure it is appropiate of our environment and conventions.
[13:27:13] <Krinkle> I'm basically blocking for 30 minutes now before I can see if it worked and then to trigger a jenkins job and then to wait again, and then repeat the cycle to switch from debug to real if I found it to work properly.
[13:27:26] <gnarf> puppet agent --test
[13:27:29] <gnarf> makes it run right now
