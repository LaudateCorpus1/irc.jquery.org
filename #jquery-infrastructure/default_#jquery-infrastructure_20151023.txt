[14:29:35] <Krinkle> gnarf: OK. I'm not super available this week, but let me know if there's anything you want me to review or verify.
[14:29:54] <Krinkle> @ on github will ping me, I check those once a day
[14:29:56] <gnarf> Krinkle: i think we have some good notes / guides from the last time
[14:30:10] <gnarf> will open issues / cc you on PRs
[14:30:14] <Krinkle> We haven't verified in a while that everything is properly puppetized, so we'll find out :)
[14:30:26] <Krinkle> Are you going to do it on a new host, or preserve state?
[14:30:42] <gnarf> Krinkle: porting configs over to ansible everywhere
[14:30:47] <gnarf> so - there's that
[14:30:52] <Krinkle> I have no experience with Ansible myself, but from seeing it "across the street" at various places I like it a lot.
[14:30:56] <gnarf> new host
[14:31:09] <Krinkle> yeah, i've seen you doing ansible-master lately.
[14:31:26] <Krinkle> I certainly like the syntax and mental model better, though I don't have any familiarity with its syntax yet.
[14:31:31] <gnarf> there is a PR open that shows the whole branch so you can comment
[14:31:42] <gnarf> if you want to look over the setups as they are now for stuff
