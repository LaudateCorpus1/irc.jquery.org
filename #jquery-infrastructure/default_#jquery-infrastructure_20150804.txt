[09:24:02] <m_gol> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1029 results in 522 from CloudFlare
[09:24:07] <m_gol> as any other swarm URL
[09:24:21] <m_gol> I've tried after clearing cache but no difference
[09:27:05] <gnarf> the host seems unreachable at digital ocean
[09:33:30] <m_gol> gnarf: do you know what can we do about it? :)
[09:33:42] <m_gol> ah, started working now
[09:33:47] <gnarf> I sent in a support request
[09:33:51] <gnarf> not sure if it helped
[09:33:57] <gnarf> maybe it just needed more time 
[09:35:44] <gnarf> "Hello there,
[09:35:45] <gnarf> I have reset the droplets networking interface on the hypervisor level and have confirmed this restored network connectivity.
[09:35:46] <gnarf> We apologize for the inconvenience. Please let us know if there's anything else we can assist you with!
[09:35:53] <gnarf> looks like the support ticket did help :)
[09:36:36] <m_gol> gnarf: yeah, it wasn't working for at least a few hours and started right after you wrote here ;)
