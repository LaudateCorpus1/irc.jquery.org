[15:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/289#issuecomment-72123800
[15:13:45] <gnarf> yeah
[15:13:51] <gnarf> i think i just killed the wrong issue
[15:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, did you not actually kill static?
[15:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> Because if you didn't, that'd be great.
[15:14:37] <gnarf> yes
[15:14:40] <gnarf> i did not
[15:14:45] <gnarf> we killed mirror
[15:14:48] <gnarf> and cdn
[15:15:33] <gnarf> there are still a few active referrers for static: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/search?q=search%20sourcetype%3Daccess_combined%20source%3D*static.origin*%20status%3E%3D200%20status%3C400%20%7C%20eval%20Time%3Dstrftime(_time%2C%22%25m%2F%25d%2F%25Y%22)%20%7C%20chart%20count%2C%20latest(Time)%20as%20last_day%20by%20referer_domain%20%7C%20sort%20-last_day&earliest=0&latest=&display.page.search.tab=statistics&display.general.t

[15:27:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: even the maxcdn reports don't show "bugs"
[15:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I see it in splunk, just posted a screenshot.
[15:29:32] <gnarf> yeah but the "last request" on that report is like 9/28/14
[15:29:38] <gnarf> so i assumed it was not using it any more
[15:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'm assuming that's when something happened.
[15:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> Everything is end of November.
[15:31:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: oh i think it must be because only like one css file is actually included
[15:31:13] <gnarf> so everything else is referrer static
[15:32:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: actually its just splunk silly load order
[15:32:59] <gnarf> let the job finish
[15:33:03] <gnarf> data looks much cleaner now
[15:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's a very long job to finish :-P
[15:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> Who has that kind of patience?!?
[15:34:25] <gnarf> im gonna post a gist
[15:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> Gah, so many other sites to sift through to see if we have more uses.
[15:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/396738e7c53acae99c69
[15:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I just reduced the list
[15:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/396738e7c53acae99c69
[15:46:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool
[15:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few at the bottom of people we might want to notify.
[15:46:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i still think we need to write something to parse the maxcdn
[15:46:36] <scott_gonzalez> But they're not us.
