[06:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: plugins site is definitely working.
[08:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: This is the second time I've seen this error today: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/4b92577cc1548c275877
[08:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...we're using grunt-clean.
[08:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> That seems silly.
[08:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> Guess I'll update all of our repos to not use that.
[12:58:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this is a really boring graph: http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=4ad1ad208484c12e&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10061&graphid=474&period=100000
[12:58:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well that's good.
[12:58:49] <gnarf> but i suppose thats a good thing
[12:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> All graphs should be boring.
[12:59:02] <gnarf> just was hoping to make sure it was working somehow
[12:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, go delete a random line from lib/hook.js :-P
[17:27:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: got any infra dreams you want us to work on realizing today?
[17:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's always https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/198
[17:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> Which is kinda massive.
[17:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> I do have something you can actually get done in one night.
[17:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if there's a ticket for it.
[17:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> Send an email for any site that has undeployed updates >X days.
[17:31:24] <gnarf> oh wait
[17:31:31] <gnarf> that was one of the things i wanted to do tonight
[17:31:40] <gnarf> fix the deploy emails to show pass/fail right away in subject
[17:32:40] <gnarf> hrm
[17:32:58] <gnarf> oh you mean if there are commits which aren't yet tagged?
[17:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> Should be pretty easy to implement.
[17:33:30] <gnarf> yeah
[17:33:37] <gnarf> we already backup all the git repos nightly
