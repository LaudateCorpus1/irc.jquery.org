[21:23:29] <Krinkle> gnarf: Thanks for `"$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"`
[21:23:32] <Krinkle> https://github.com/gnarf37/.dotfiles/blob/master/init.sh
[21:23:44] <Krinkle> I was looking for something like it. dirname $0 didn't work, obviousy.
[21:24:48] <gnarf> Krinkle: thank google
[21:24:50] <gnarf> just found it;)
[21:25:06] <Krinkle> I couldn't find it. It's a though one to search for.
[21:25:15] <Krinkle> tough*
[21:25:22] <Krinkle> Remember your query?
[21:26:14] <gnarf> bash directory of script source or something
[21:26:17] <gnarf> was a stackoverfloe
[21:26:26] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-stored-in
[21:27:39] <Krinkle> Ah, so it works as a replacement for dirname $0 not just when it isn't invoked from the command line, but always/
[21:27:53] <Krinkle> That's great
[21:28:20] <Krinkle> In my case the file I used it is in source'd from bashrc
[21:31:49] <gnarf> nice, got that working: http://cl.ly/image/1d451q30000T
[21:32:22] <gnarf> now to get user working
[21:33:31] <Krinkle> gnarf: the checkmark is previous exit code? 
[21:33:38] <gnarf> yeah
[21:33:40] <Krinkle> k
[21:33:42] <gnarf> check or x
[21:33:46] <gnarf> with exit code if x
[21:37:35] <gnarf> nice
