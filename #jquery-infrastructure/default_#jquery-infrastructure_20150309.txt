[06:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess it's good that syslog output for jquery-license has been nonexistent since the update to not use GitHub's internal PR branches.
[07:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> arthurvr: So after digging through the error logs in more detail, I was able to re-confirm that there was nothing at all about that learn PR.
[07:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> I then checked GitHub and it said there was a service timeout for the hook delivery.
[07:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why our server wouldn't have responded. As far as I can tell the server was still running when the hook was delivered.
[07:42:02] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What timezone is syslog using?
[07:43:08] <scott_gonzalez> I redelivered the hook and it worked just fine, as expected.
[07:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> The jquery failure is expected. That's GitHub being annoying. I've already landed a fix to deal with that.
[07:56:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no idea
[07:56:28] <gnarf> i assume system time
[07:56:31] <gnarf> run `date` ?
[07:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I did that and got UTC.
[07:57:09] <scott_gonzalez> So syslog should be UTC as well?
[08:22:12] <gnarf> i think so?
[08:22:15] <gnarf> tail one?
[08:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's a simple solution ;-)
[08:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> It is indeed UTC.
[08:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:45:43] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: Thanks!

[10:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> I think the deployments for jquery-license aren't working properly.
[10:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> That happens every time we deploy. It completes with a status of 0, but then the next ensure check says it changed from stopped to running.
