[00:33:58] <gnarf> s5fs still around?
[10:36:01] <s5fs> gnarf: ping
[10:40:15] <s5fs> gnarf: orkel states that his login has not changed. i did not find him in /etc/passwd and I'm 99% sure I updated mysql correctly. is there another place login info may be stored?
[10:48:18] <s5fs> gnarf: okay I forgot to update .htpasswd, I think that's the culprit. I'll ping orkel/markelog for a re-test. thanks!
