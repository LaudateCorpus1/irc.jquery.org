[07:55:44] <gnarf> clarkbox: yt?
[07:56:46] <gnarf> clarkbox: I was just noticing that the satge. domains are logged to the same filename as the "main" host so there isn't any distinction in splunk between api.jquery.com and stage.api.jquery.com for instance
[07:56:58] <gnarf> should I change the nginx configs so that they log to stage. log files?
[09:04:12] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf
[11:20:26] <clarkbox> gnarf - yes if you can change it please. there is no way to tell the hosts apart from the log file last i checked
[11:50:22] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: gnarf: did you guys ever get anywhere with setting up a wordpress instance locally for the content folks?
[11:50:25] <johnbender> I'm working on docs
[11:50:31] <johnbender> :)
[11:51:11] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: gnarf: can we just fire up the right vm using the infra project right now?
[12:11:09] <Krinkle> johnbender: docs.jquery.org?
[12:11:12] <Krinkle> com*
[12:13:26] <johnbender> Krinkle: no the new api sites specifically
[12:13:53] <johnbender> Krinkle: stage.api.jquerymobile.com for example
[12:25:25] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: Redirects on the docs-wiki are now 301
[12:25:43] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: Also, added redirect target domains for jqui, jqcore, jqui-api and jqcore-api
[12:25:49] <Krinkle> e.g. http://docs.jquery.com/mw/index.php?title=UI/API/1.8/Button&redirect=no
[12:26:11] <Krinkle> Now that the new doc sites are up and with versioning, we can create redirects for articles like those
[12:26:18] <Krinkle> http://docs.jquery.com/Special:PopularPages is a good list to work from
[12:26:44] <Krinkle> syntax: http://docs.jquery.com/mw/index.php?title=UI/API/1.8/Button&action=edit
[12:26:51] <Krinkle> prefixes: http://docs.jquery.com/Special:Interwiki
[12:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/131
[12:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting a report from someone that qunitjs.com is giving them: Domain mapping issue. You have jquery-wp-content configured for jquery.com.
[12:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how they can be seeing that when it's working fine for me.
[12:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> And now he says it's fine.
[12:40:38] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[12:42:55] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: you should be able to yes. All the production servers are using the same puppet manifests
[13:20:24] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: then the next question is, how can we provide that for people who want to help out or work on the sites
[13:20:27] <johnbender> err
[13:20:29] <johnbender>  docs
[13:20:39] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I'm under the impression we don't want to expose all the config stuff
[13:23:21] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: they'd have to checkout the repo
[13:23:26] <ryanneufeld> and stand it up on their own end
[13:27:00] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: there isn't really anything along the lines of the infra repo we can hand out.
[13:27:11] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: perhaps that's a project we should add
[13:45:05] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yar
[13:46:42] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: https://github.com/ryanneufeld/php54-sandbox
[13:46:51] <ryanneufeld> perhaps we could for that project
[13:47:11] <ryanneufeld> I originally started it after the summit, with the intent of it being that kind of a project
[13:51:14] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: alright
[13:52:33] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: perhaps a vagrant config for each site? so that they can just do vagrant up api.jqueryui.com or something like that?
[13:53:19] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: that's how it is now
[13:53:25] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: that's the exact command
[13:54:06] <ryanneufeld> not sure what you're using
[13:54:12] <ryanneufeld> but that's not a valid host
[13:54:16] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: ah
[13:54:17] <ryanneufeld> *machine name
[13:54:25] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: we could just as easily do a translation
[13:54:28] <johnbender> well
[13:54:33] <johnbender> hmm
[13:54:38] <johnbender> when there's a one to one at least
[13:54:41] <ryanneufeld> well, the thing is, that the infra repo has passwords and stuff in it
[13:54:44] <ryanneufeld> so we don't want to give that out
[13:54:47] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yes
[13:54:49] <johnbender> that was my assumption
[13:55:02] <ryanneufeld> I'm thinking just a basic "Here is a super easy way to get a PHP server running so you can build this stuff"
[13:55:15] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: wordpress is part of the issue though
[13:55:34] <ryanneufeld> well, we can automate some of that
[13:55:47] <ryanneufeld> I just recently got mysql installing nicely with puppet manifests
[13:55:54] <ryanneufeld> so that's an easy to manage thing
[13:56:26] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: there isn't a pre-existing manifest for that kind of thing?
[13:56:33] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: yes
[13:56:47] <ryanneufeld> though it seems more complex than mine
[13:56:59] <ryanneufeld> gnarf originally wrote it I think
[13:57:24] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I mean it seems like the kind of thing that puppet labs would provide
[13:57:35] <ryanneufeld> oh
[13:57:39] <ryanneufeld> like a module
[13:57:42] <ryanneufeld> I didn't find one I liked
[13:57:48] <johnbender> ah
[13:58:55] <ryanneufeld> I just pm'd you a gist of the manifest I wrote
[13:59:02] <ryanneufeld> we're using percona
[13:59:08] <ryanneufeld> which made things a touch harder
[13:59:17] <ryanneufeld> but it's a pretty straight forward thing to install it
[13:59:25] <ryanneufeld> and I found that code on the puppet forums
[16:00:10] <gnarf> johnbender: jquery-wp-content's readme has instructions for setting it up on MAMP/WAMP
[16:00:41] <johnbender> gnarf: yah I talked with ajpiano but it would be nice to avoid that
[16:01:02] <gnarf> johnbender: it'd be easier to just setup a vagrant in jquery-wp-content i think
[16:01:09] <johnbender> gnarf: maybe I'll just create a separate project for the vagrant stuff and people can pull it in if they like
[16:01:12] <johnbender> yah
[16:01:15] <johnbender> exactly
[19:40:16] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: why is that htaccess file not in the repo?
