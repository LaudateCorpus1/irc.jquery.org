[08:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> Is anyone interested in working on this? https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/16
[08:45:56] <gnarf> yeah, i can update that at some point later
[08:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> I only noticed it because 1.0 (the version we're using) doesn't have a license.
[08:51:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you test/land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/313 - we need it for codeorigin
[12:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's not quite enough: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/313#issuecomment-47390681
[12:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> I can put that on my todo list right after what I'm currently working on if you need.
[12:29:46] <scott_gonzalez> uhoh, did jq01 just die?
[21:04:10] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: nah, i looked too and it was up. seemed like a hiccup with the monitoring.
