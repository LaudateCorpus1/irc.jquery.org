[13:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: Will one of you be available during the day on Friday to roll out the new events site?
[13:51:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: daytime, no
[13:51:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but i will be on a plane friday night
[13:51:54] <gnarf> do we want to soft launch or like announce?
[13:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there will be any announcement.
[13:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> It will look just like the old site.
[13:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> But will use jquery-wp-content and be sane to manage.
[21:48:26] <ES> Hey there gnarf and s5fs my name is Erik.  I was talking to Kris B and wanted to offer to help in any way I can.
