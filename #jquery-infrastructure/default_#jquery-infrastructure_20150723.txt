[07:18:17] <gnarf> arthurvr: Whichever is easier for you
[07:20:37] <arthurvr> gnarf: gonna do them all in one PR then. Thatâ€™s less noisy. 
[07:20:46] <arthurvr> Did you catch https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/108?
[07:21:04] <gnarf> yeah - saw it - I'm in Austin at txjs this week
[07:22:23] <arthurvr> gnarf: Alright. Have fun at txjs!
[07:26:09] <arthurvr> gnarf: landing the api.qunitjs.com PR before removing the nginx config isnâ€™t gonna give any troubles, right? I donâ€™t think it would but just want to be sure.
[07:34:53] <gnarf> arthurvr: correct, i'd actually prefer we did that 
[07:35:05] <gnarf> just make sure to local test the redirects go to the right places
[07:36:01] <arthurvr> gnarf: Alright, then Iâ€™m going to land that first PR when I get home and work on some other sites :) Thanks!
[07:36:46] <gnarf> the nginx config "wins" obviously, redirecting before it gets to the server
[07:37:09] <gnarf> arthurvr: the one thing I'm a little "worried" about is the "fuzzy matching" of nginx redirects -- basiclly all those are "starts with"
[07:37:35] <gnarf> arthurvr: do you have a login for splunk
[07:38:04] <arthurvr> no I donâ€™t. And yeah, I thought about that too.
