[14:40:57] <Krinkle> I need to install Composer
[14:41:02] <Krinkle> Not sure how we wanna do that
[14:41:16] <Krinkle> on swarm-01
[14:42:19] <Krinkle> Left a comment on https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/327.
[16:50:10] <gnarf> Krinkle: probably https://github.com/tPl0ch/puppet-composer
[16:50:14] <gnarf> cc s5fs 
[16:51:11] <Krinkle> that's a lot of code!
[16:52:19] <Krinkle> but seems neccecary to make it work universally
[16:52:43] <Krinkle> I'm probably not puppety enough to integrate/test that.
[16:52:54] <gnarf> if there is a quick bash onliner to install composer
[16:52:57] <gnarf> we can exec it
[16:53:05] <gnarf> with an unless => 'which composer'
[16:53:47] <gnarf> or whatever the command it installs is
[16:57:06] <gnarf> exec { "curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php ; mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin": creates => "/usr/local/bin/composer" }
[16:58:27] <gnarf> exec { "install composer": command => "curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php ; mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin", creates => "/usr/local/bin/composer" }  ( https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#exec )
[16:58:47] <gnarf> you might need to bash -c that exec
[16:58:53] <gnarf> i dunno if it supports full piping or not
[17:00:49] <gnarf> i think you want provider => shell too: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#exec-provider-shell
