[10:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld: I just landed this same commit in pretty much every repo: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/commit/24c01a8ccd40bb52b18254aa7022a4d17ec95013
[10:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't add it to infra because I wasn't sure if there was anything that might have weird line ending rules, but I doubt it.
[10:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> Can anyone confirm that this is ok to add?
[11:17:24] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I don't think it would be a problem
[11:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try it out. If things do blow up for some reason, we can investigate or just revert.
[11:19:08] <scott_gonzalez> Commit to puppet-stage first?
[11:25:18] <ryanneufeld> just do it
[11:25:23] <ryanneufeld> if it's bad, we take it out :p
[11:25:28] <ryanneufeld> it won't break anything in prod

[14:43:28] <s5fs> nacin: ping!
[14:44:22] <s5fs> nacin: Just got an email from a security researcher stating that our WP install is crufty and vulnerable. It appears we're on 3.4.1, although I thought we were set to auto-update.
[14:44:49] <s5fs> Am I mistaken in assuming that auto-updating/patching would bump us from 3.4 to 3.8?
[14:46:36] <nacin> s5fs: which WP install is on 3.4?
[14:47:05] <nacin> the jquery.com network is 3.8
[14:47:10] <nacin> it should be updated to 3.8.3
[14:47:35] <nacin> auto-updating is currently broken on jquery.com for whatever reason, I've told scott_gonzalez I'll look into it but don't have time this week
[15:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs nacin: The blog is on 3.4.1. I can update it tonight or tomorrow.
[16:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld: Can someone back up the WP DB for blog.jquery.com and blog.jqueryui.com?
[16:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess we have automated backups for this, right?
[16:27:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sudo tarsnap --list-archives on the machine
[16:27:45] <gnarf> see if it has recent backup
[16:28:03] <gnarf> you should be able to kick an immediate backup via sudo /usr/local/snapit/snapit.sh or something like that
