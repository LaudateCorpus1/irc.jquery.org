[04:22:20] <zajdeee> hello #jquery-infrastructure
[04:23:04] <zajdeee> can I find someone responsible for the jQuery CDN (code.jquery.com) here?
[17:04:13] <zajdeee> mgol: hello there, sorry to bother you - I have just posted an update to https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/51. I am sure this is not something high on your priority list, but it should be easily doable and it just requires someone to reconfigure the CDN. I'd like to help, but as I don't have the necessary rights, I can't do much. :)
[17:15:06] <mgol> zajdeee: Hi! I answered on the issue
[17:26:01] <zajdeee> mgol: thanks, I am following up there (my ssh session died so I didn't notice your answer here). :)
