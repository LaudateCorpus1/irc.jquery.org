[00:07:44] <s5fs> arthurvr: not that I'm aware of, feel free to create an issue :)
[08:14:32] <arthurvr> s5fs: Itâ€™s okay right now. He rejoined the channel somewhere yesterday.
[09:23:24] <ryanneufeld> arthurvr: b-ot will auto join certain channels, including this one. But you can invite it to any channel. 
[11:20:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: To get contribute.jquery.org showing PR CLA check results, what are your thoughts on where the actual data will live?
[11:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> Just add a const in jquery-wp-content's config.php that points to a URL?
[11:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just pick a domain and have a fixed value.
[11:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> I figure the server that does the PR checks can also just serve the pages.
[11:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> So it's just a matter of setting up nginx to point whatever domain/path we want to that server.
[11:23:34] <gnarf> sure
[11:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, we can even just have nginx serve those files.
[11:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> The PR server can just write static files to a directory and nginx can serve it.
[11:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll start working on that. Adding a config value to jquery-wp-content and having the jquery-license server write out JSON files to a dir.
[11:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> And adding a page in contribute that reads those and generates pretty pages.
[11:25:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's gonna be so nice finally having this running.
