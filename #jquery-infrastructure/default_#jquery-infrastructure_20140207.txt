[05:02:15] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Is there a reason we don't allow Google to index irc.jquery.org? I've tried this: site:irc.jquery.org some search terms and I got no results. Even when I searched for the word "the" I got only one search result - something about it not being able to provide me with a description.
[05:02:31] <_|Nix|_> It'd be really nice to be able to search through the IRC history.
[08:40:54] <gnarf> i turned it off a while back
[08:40:57] <gnarf> i don't remember why
