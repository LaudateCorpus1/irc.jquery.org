[11:28:13] <m_gol> gnarf s5fs: can we update Jenkins to Node 4? Node 0.10 with npm 1.4 are ancient and may cause problems
[12:22:20] <gnarf> m_gol: we'd love to try
[12:22:30] <gnarf> I think s5fs was working on building a new jenkins server
[12:23:06] <m_gol> hmm, right
[17:38:16] <s5fs> m_gol: gnarf is right, i am working on creating an ansible script to manage jenkins
[17:38:39] <s5fs> i don't yet have an estimate for when that machine will be ready, i've just started work. give me until monday and i'll have a better timeline.
[17:39:06] <s5fs> i agree we need to get to a newer version of node, 0.10 is ancient lol
[18:31:40] <s5fs> I'm going to reboot the builder server
[18:32:23] <s5fs> and we're back
