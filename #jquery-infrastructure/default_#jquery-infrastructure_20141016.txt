[05:05:34] <m_gol> s5fs ryanneufeld gnarf: ping
[05:06:27] <arschmitz> m_gol: It will likely be a while for them any thing i might be able to help with?
[05:07:55] <arschmitz> m_gol: s5fs decided a while back i'm early morning tier 1 support ha ha ha :-)
[05:09:29] <m_gol> arschmitz: I'm getting 404 from nginx when trying to join the swarm from Android 4.3-4.4 on BrowserStack, all works fine with <=4.2
[05:10:01] <m_gol> it shows "connected to the swarm" but below that there's a frame with 404
[05:10:14] <arschmitz> m_gol: thats kinda crazy
[05:10:41] <m_gol> I wanted to start testing Core on 4.3-4.4 now that they're available
[05:10:57] <arschmitz> m_gol: there were some URL handling issues when they released 4.3 but i dont think any that i know of should be a problem here
[05:11:15] <arschmitz> m_gol: i think most only effected webviews not the browser
[05:11:54] <m_gol> I'd like to check the URL from this frame but no idea how to check it on this emulator...
[05:12:23] <m_gol> maybe I'll just add it and run tests and then revert if it breaks badly
[05:13:28] <m_gol> at least then I'll know what URLs are broken
[05:14:35] <m_gol> arschmitz ^
[05:15:12] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah that seems like the way to do it 
[05:15:21] <arschmitz> emulators making debuging rough

[05:16:14] <arschmitz> m_gol: thats why i still have a physical device lab and don't rely on emulators
[05:16:43] <m_gol> arschmitz: yeah, but our automatic tests have to run on sth :)
[05:16:51] <arschmitz> m_gol: oh i know 
[05:17:04] <arschmitz> m_gol: i was just saying debugging remote emulators is horrible
[05:17:19] <m_gol> even local emulators are terrible
[05:17:25] <arschmitz> yup
[05:17:28] <m_gol> s/emulators/Android emulators
[05:17:43] <arschmitz> m_gol: yup i almost never use them
[05:17:53] <m_gol> the iOS ones are actually fine 99% of the time
[05:18:33] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah iv had far fewer ios emulator issues
[05:19:58] <arschmitz> m_gol: though to be honest iv had far fewer ios issues in general then android
[05:20:10] <m_gol> :)

[05:45:32] <arschmitz> m_gol: thats weird
[05:47:23] <m_gol> arschimtz: I created an infra ticket
[05:47:31] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah i saw
[05:48:06] <arschmitz> m_gol: its just weird that a url is getting so broken by the browser
[05:48:15] <arschmitz> m_gol: thats a really really serious bug
[05:48:22] <m_gol> yeah, I wouldn't expect an error at this point
[05:49:15] <arschmitz> m_gol: the idea that putting the same url in two different browsers will actually go to 2 different places means the internet is essentially completely broken
[05:49:21] <m_gol> :)
[05:49:24] <arschmitz> on those devices
[05:49:47] <m_gol> yeah, I'd just want to know a little more before I forward it to BrowserStack
[05:50:11] <arschmitz> yeah did you manage to get an example of what the url thats getting the 404 actually is
[05:50:43] <arschmitz> if you do i can look back at the bugs i mentioned with url parsing we saw in mobile to see if any look related 
[05:51:43] <m_gol> I didn't, I don't know where are logs for that and I have no idea how to actually check this URL
[05:51:57] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah i have no idea either
[05:52:54] <arschmitz> m_gol: if you find anything more out let me know and i can help to try and debug the issue and i also have physical 4.4 and 4.3 devices i could try if we had a url i could point them at
[05:54:21] <m_gol> arschmitz: could you follow a process from https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm#add-a-browser (just change the "browserstack" part in the runUrl to any other string) and see if you see the 404 on this URL?
[05:56:43] <m_gol> I wish they tested their browsers more closely before publishing them... we have problems with nearly an every single mobile browser they add
[05:56:51] <m_gol> that's bad
[05:57:36] <arschmitz> m_gol: ok so you want me to add my physical device as a new browser and then your going to trigger a build?
[05:58:22] <m_gol> arschmitz: for now I'd just like to know if you see this 404 or not
[05:58:42] <m_gol> not sure how to configure it all, the whole infrastructure relies on BrowserStack launchers
[05:58:45] <arschmitz> ok but to do that i need to add my phone as a new browser your saying?
[05:59:18] <m_gol> just going to this URL with the "browserstack" part changed won't trigger any build
[05:59:50] <m_gol> you should just see your browser recognized as Android 4.3 or 4.4 and see the message that joining the swarm succeeded
[05:59:54] <arschmitz> oh sorry ha i think you linked to the wrong section
[05:59:55] <m_gol> and not see any 404 below that :)
[06:00:06] <arschmitz> m_gol: did you mean the run token section with the run url?
[06:00:25] <m_gol> arschmitz: right section, just ignore everything except the 3rd bullet :)
[06:00:43] <m_gol> and instead of logging to BrowserStack, do it from a real device
[06:00:51] <arschmitz> ok
[06:01:49] <arschmitz> just give me a minute
[06:04:15] <arschmitz> m_gol: so i need to get a run token first right ?
[06:04:19] <m_gol> yup
[06:05:35] <arschmitz> hmmm im not getting an ssh response from jq03
[06:13:28] <m_gol> arschmitz: works for me
[06:19:44] <cgack> gnarf s5fs: Ping!
[08:34:37] <m_gol> arschmitz: It doesn't work when not run manually :( http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3692
[08:35:37] <arschmitz> m_gol: :/
[08:35:57] <arschmitz> ok well dont kick it off this time
[08:36:03] <arschmitz> and ill try and debug it
[08:36:20] <m_gol> ok
[08:36:36] <arschmitz> oh ill need a new access token though right?
[08:36:52] <arschmitz> wait what look at test swarm
[08:37:00] <arschmitz> they are running on my device lol
[08:37:08] <arschmitz> when i went and reloaded it kicked off
[08:37:12] <arschmitz> m_gol: ^^
[08:37:23] <m_gol> yes
[08:37:40] <m_gol> for some reason our infra doesn't span those devices by itself :/
[08:38:15] <m_gol> * spawn
[08:53:37] <m_gol> arschmitz: I added more info on the ticket. I don't know what else I could do, what happens before workers are spawned lies beyond my knowledge
[08:53:59] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah im not super familier with test swarm
[08:54:23] <arschmitz> mobile does not run on it because it was never set up and at this point we are just hoping to use browserstack runner
[08:54:34] <arschmitz> but thats not usable for us yet either...
[09:18:10] <m_gol> arschmitz: Sizzle runs on Karma
[09:20:02] <arschmitz> m_gol: i have not tried the mobile suite on karma
[09:43:05] <arschmitz> m_gol: did you manually kick off 4.3?
[09:49:26] <m_gol> no
[09:49:32] <m_gol> arschmitz: ^

[10:36:26] <m_gol> yeah, I've seen that one, I don't remember now if I didn't open sth by accident...
[10:37:06] <arschmitz> m_gol: ok
[10:37:20] <m_gol> but http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3692 is stuck
