[06:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know what's caching the HTML for the footer of blog.jquerymobile.com?
[06:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> I see the right (nearly empty) footer when I'm logged in.
[06:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> But when I'm not logged in, I see the old HTML, but the new CSS.
[06:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> Which looks really bad.
[06:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, looks like mobile is using super cache instead of total cache.
[06:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> I changed the expiration for the cache and it's working now.
[12:27:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[12:27:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we get the blog.'s onto the new setup already? :)
[12:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I'm hoping to have time to work on that soon.
[13:06:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: let me know if there is something I can do to help
[13:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> When I get to it, I'll let you know.
