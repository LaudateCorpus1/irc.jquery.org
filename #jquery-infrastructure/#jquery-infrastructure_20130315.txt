[06:52:16] <rworth> anyone around that can tackle a quick redirect? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/165
[07:31:37] <ryanneufeld>  rworth I can do that one
[07:31:43] <rworth> thanks ryanneufeld 
[07:31:48] <ryanneufeld> assign to me, I'll take a look when I'm in the office :)
[07:39:43] <rworth> gnarf I assigned you an issue as well https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/166
[08:55:01] <jqcommit> 01[13infrastructure01] 15gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-stage: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/dc08fc655d976e88603e341e471193b4c65c5871
[08:55:01] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 14dc08fc6 15Corey Frang: Adding redirects/proxies for jquery.org - Closes #165 - Closes #166
[08:55:23] <gnarf> rworth: pushing this to stage to test ^^^
[08:55:45] <gnarf> should be working now
[08:56:31] <gnarf> rworth: got an issue with the styles on that page
[08:56:44] <rworth> mmm, yeah you would :)
[08:56:51] <gnarf> https://stage.jquery.org/updates/
[08:57:03] <gnarf> also, all the scripts/assets are on http:// only servers
[08:57:11] <gnarf> this blocker is bigger than you expect i think
[08:57:47] <rworth> grr
[08:59:13] <rworth> this might have to do until Mon, which is the next time there will be an update. At least the content is accessible
[08:59:19] <rworth> unless you have any ideas about a quick fix
[09:00:18] <rworth> we could do a theme like scott_gonzalez has done for the blogs that aren't switched over yet
[09:00:33] <rworth> scott_gonzalez is that hard to port/replicate?
[09:00:35] <gnarf> everything would need to be in /updates/*
[09:00:45] <gnarf> all the assets would need to be served from that folder
[09:00:55] <gnarf> also there is funky stuff in there to use static
[09:00:57] <gnarf> which will break
[09:01:12] <rworth> it can pull assets from the actual site theme
[09:01:19] <gnarf> http://static.jquery.com/org/style.css === http://jquery.org/style.css for instance
[09:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: If you want it to look like jquery.org, then it's pretty easy.
[09:01:49] <rworth> yeah
[09:02:32] <gnarf> so, deal with broken update page until scott_gonzalez can themeify the old jquery.org 
[09:02:33] <gnarf> ?
[09:02:55] <rworth> I think that's doable
[09:03:09] <jqcommit> 01[13infrastructure01] 15gnarf37 merged 06puppet-stage into 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/compare/5c859387845f...dc08fc655d97
[09:07:57] <gnarf> are there any other blockers?
[09:08:19] <gnarf> i see ryanneufeld rode in with good fixes for the https deploy problem and the swipe keys
[09:08:21] <gnarf> +1
[09:08:30] <rworth> dmethvin is working on the history page, scott_gonzalez on the coupon code, I'm working on the join/thanks page
[09:08:41] <rworth> I think there may be no infra blockers :)
[09:08:46] <gnarf> DNS
[09:08:50] <rworth> oh, right
[09:08:54] <rworth> how's the TTL?
[09:08:58] <gnarf> 3600
[09:09:00] <gnarf> or 1800
[09:09:03] <rworth> (should've thought of that yesterday)
[09:09:07] <rworth> units?
[09:09:09] <gnarf> nothing longer in our network anymore
[09:09:11] <gnarf> seconds
[09:09:15] <gnarf> hour/halfhour
[09:09:18] <rworth> schweet
[09:10:04] <ryanneufeld> moring
[09:10:13] <rworth> heyo
[09:10:47] <ryanneufeld> so you guys got dis?
[09:12:43] <rworth> looks like it
[09:12:45] <rworth> thanks ryanneufeld 
[09:13:37] <ryanneufeld> cool
[09:18:14] <gnarf> in case im afk later when they want to swap dns over
[09:18:23] <gnarf> you'll be here ya ryanneufeld?
[09:18:28] <gnarf> still have the dns login info?
[09:18:35] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: what could go wrong?
[09:19:06] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: that was a legit question
[09:19:13] <ryanneufeld> I do have the login details yes
[09:19:18] <ryanneufeld> I think
[09:20:22] <ryanneufeld> I seem to have lost the username
[10:58:45] <rworth> gnarf ryanneufeld let's flip the dns switch :D
[10:59:29] <ryanneufeld> rworth: okay
[10:59:34] <ryanneufeld> what IP should it be pointing at now?
[11:00:33] <rworth> same as jquery.com
[11:01:16] <ryanneufeld> 70.32.120.34
[11:01:19] <ryanneufeld> does that seem right?
[11:01:46] <ryanneufeld> oh yeah
[11:01:58] <ryanneufeld> that's where brand/contribute/delegate all go to
[11:02:01] <ryanneufeld> it's done
[11:02:02] <rworth> cool
[11:02:06] <rworth> yay
[11:08:35] <gnarf> yay
[13:51:51] <ryanneufeld> looks hawt
