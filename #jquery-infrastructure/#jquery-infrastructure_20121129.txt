[12:24:33] <rworth> clarkbox does it take time for irc.jquery.com to update?
[12:25:01] <clarkbox> its pretty quick
[12:25:11] <clarkbox> 5 min i think
[12:25:17] <rworth> ok
[12:25:34] <rworth> just asking caus I couldn't remember if last time it was a delay or you forgot a step ;)
[12:25:46] <clarkbox> i still need to add a link to the page
[12:26:08] <clarkbox> last time was forgot step i think
[12:26:11] <clarkbox> i forget ;)
[12:26:23] <rworth> :)
[12:32:44] <clarkbox> rworth: index.html updated with link
[12:33:18] <rworth> clarkbox awesome thanks
[13:23:40] <clarkbox> i have emailed ubisoft "webmaster" requesting that they fix the code that is hot linking to jqueryui.com. they are sending us about 1000 404's per min.
[13:31:36] <clarkbox> i am beginning to think, that at some point, we had a absolute URL in some css file of jquery ui
[13:31:50] <clarkbox> there are A LOT of sites that are causing 404's to theme png's
[13:32:11] <clarkbox> and those sites, are not sending any 200's

[14:12:01] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: we've been dealing with those by adding the missing file with an alert :P
[14:12:12] <clarkbox> yaaa
[14:12:15] <clarkbox> in this case we cant
[14:12:20] <clarkbox> they are not pulling .js files
[14:12:29] <clarkbox> atleast not in most cases
[14:12:38] <clarkbox> and, if it was our mistake, i don't think we should do that
[14:12:52] <clarkbox> which i think might be the case here
[16:43:31] <clarkbox> krinkle, gnarf: too early to say for sureâ€¦ but it looks like BS has reduced the number of disconnects
