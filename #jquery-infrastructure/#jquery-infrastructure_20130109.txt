[08:10:08] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf
[08:13:00] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: can you take a look at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/tree/backupscripts and tell me if you think I'm going in the right direction?
[08:13:20] <ryanneufeld> also see https://github.com/ryanneufeld/puppet-backup
[09:53:55] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: Krinkle if i give one of you an updated qunit logo, can you update the twitter avatar
[09:54:01] <ajpiano> to use the purple not the green?
[10:45:39] <gnarf> github's postrecieves seem to not be working right now...
[10:45:50] <gnarf> no irc notifications, no http notifications
[10:52:00] <ryanneufeld> odd
[10:52:10] <ryanneufeld> did you see my previous msgs gnarf?
[10:52:39] <gnarf> yeah
[10:52:49] <gnarf> seems to be headed down the right path
[10:53:29] <ryanneufeld> somehow I ended up on a list getting every single jquery mobile issue notification
[10:53:34] <ryanneufeld> I can't seem to figure out how to make it stop
[10:53:50] <ryanneufeld> being sent to  jquery/jquery-mobile <jquery-mobile@noreply.github.com>
[10:54:37] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: jqdeploy gets it i think
[10:54:47] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: im not sure what it is either
[10:59:09] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: I'll see if i can figure it out
[11:27:00] <rworth> I assume I can ignore the jqdeploy verification email from GitHub?
[11:28:01] <ryanneufeld> yup
[11:29:20] <gnarf> actually, can you verify it?
[11:29:27] <gnarf> idunno where mine ended up :)
[11:30:00] <ryanneufeld> someone did, the link 404s
[11:30:14] <gnarf> found it
[11:31:11] <gnarf> it 404s when you're logged in as someone else
[11:31:15] <gnarf> just got it workin
