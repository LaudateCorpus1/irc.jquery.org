[08:59:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: This is happening now, right? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/170
[09:00:26] <gnarf> doesn't appear so https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/manifests/siteupdater.pp#L64
[09:01:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok, can you add that?

[09:03:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^
[09:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> I wish GitHub had graphs for issues.
[09:09:07] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: not free but https://ducksboard.com/landing/github/
[09:11:16] <s5fs> arschmitz: interesting!
[09:15:23] <arschmitz> s5fs: ehh i signed up for free trial its worthless
[09:16:02] <s5fs> arschmitz: too bad, its an interesting idea
[09:16:13] <arschmitz> s5fs: yeah it only gives a graph of total issues
[09:16:16] <arschmitz> not open / closed
[09:16:22] <arschmitz> and it wont go back in time
[09:16:36] <arschmitz> so i set one up and it only shows august and the current count
[09:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> Not entirely sure about this: http://cl.ly/image/2t2y1o0o3c3z
[09:18:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/252/edit
[09:18:05] <arschmitz> thats all you get for a graph
[09:18:09] <arschmitz> for issues
[09:18:14] <arschmitz> that one is for mobile
[09:18:17] <arschmitz> its useless 
[09:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> Bah
[09:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> I want something like the Trac TicketGraph
[09:20:00] <arschmitz> yeah when i saw it i thought they might have something like that but no
[09:20:16] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you can use all that free time you have to write something using the github api
[09:20:19] <arschmitz> :)
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I've considered it many times.
[09:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> I had started planning it once.
[09:23:49] <arschmitz> it would not be that hard really but probably a bit time consuming 
[09:24:13] <scott_gonzalez> But then I found the organization dashboard.
[09:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/organizations/jquery/dashboard/issues/
[09:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> And I decided it was good enough for the overview I needed at the time.
[09:24:49] <arschmitz> oh ha i didnt know about that actually
[09:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> I really want a view like https://github.com/organizations/jquery/dashboard/issues/assigned?direction=asc&sort=created&state=open for all repos.
[09:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> Not just within jquery org.
[09:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> Which I eventually found out was available too: https://github.com/dashboard/issues
[09:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd love graphs of this data.
[09:28:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'd also like to see rollup graphs at the org level.
[09:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> Like pulse, punch card, commit graphs, etc. for the collective repos in the jquery org.
[09:29:19] <arschmitz> i wonder if you yelled loud enough in githubs general direction if they would consider it 
[09:29:27] <arschmitz> i cant imagine it would be very hard for them
[09:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What are the other origin domains?
[11:00:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/services.pp#L129-L135
[11:00:48] <scott_gonzalez> WTF is content?
[11:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> static will die over time.
[11:01:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm not 100% sure whats on them - content might have the podcasts?
[11:01:39] * gnarf shrugs
[11:01:40] <b-ot> gnarf: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[11:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, looks like conf videos and podcasts.
[11:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file separate issues for each domain.
