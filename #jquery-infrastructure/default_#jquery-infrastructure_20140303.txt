[08:37:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez sorry to bug - where is that script you had to check the IRC github hooks for which modes were enabled?
[08:37:39] <s5fs> gnarf: morning
[08:56:05] <scottgonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/foundation/tree/master/scripts/irc-hooks
[08:56:50] <scottgonzalez> I'm pretty sure the README is out of date. It should prompt you for repos that don't have a hook already created.

[10:58:19] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: wow that cache-control guy is a real awesome one huh?
[10:58:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah a jerk
[10:58:48] <DaveMethvin> had i seen the ticket earlier i would have moved it
[10:59:15] <DaveMethvin> if you don't mind, post a note there once it's resolved
[10:59:59] <scottgonzalez> DaveMethvin: You're such a jerk for SILENTLY closing the ticket :-P
[11:00:34] <DaveMethvin> somehow if i just left it that way for several years he'd be happier i guess
[11:01:19] <scottgonzalez> Well, he'd just keep going on and telling people how shitty our CDN is...
[11:02:15] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15gnarf closed issue #245: Cache control headers not set on CDN 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/245
[11:03:17] <scottgonzalez> gnarf: So is this just on codeorigin and MaxCDN is just copying the headers?
[11:03:38] <scottgonzalez> I wouldn't have expected that to be how MaxCDN works.
[11:04:13] <scottgonzalez> Basically I'm surprised that this is something we can fix through the infrastructure repo as opposed to some MaxCDN admin panel.
[11:25:01] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: it looks to me like two headers are valid, and the second does not override the first
