[09:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: code.jquery.com didn't update again.
[09:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer landed a change to the UI index and it never made it to the CDN.
[09:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> I just manually did a reload.
[09:54:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I don't think the indexes are being ?reload 'ed automatically
[09:54:41] <gnarf> its a manual step
[09:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I thought you set it up so that every index gets reloaded on every deploy.
[09:55:23] <gnarf> nope - that never got written
[09:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[09:55:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file an issue.
[09:55:46] <gnarf> should be relatively easy to add a post-deploy to do that though
[09:55:53] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want it on the infrastructure repo?
[09:56:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: codeorigin.jquery.com might make more sense
[09:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:56:32] <gnarf> because then it could actually be an "each" sort of thing
[09:56:38] <gnarf> in case we add a new index later
