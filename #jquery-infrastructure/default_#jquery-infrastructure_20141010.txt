[08:01:12] <kborchers> gnarf: s5fs zz_ryanneufeld anyone around?
[08:39:29] <gnarf> kborchers: yo
[08:40:27] <kborchers> gnarf: hey, so we have some issues with the plugins site. looks like scott_gonzalez might have tracked down possible causes but not sure. basically you can't update plugins anymore
[08:40:53] <gnarf> right, i caught those errors by chance in the error logs
[08:41:36] <gnarf> i think it might just need a config change / wordpress version bump
[08:41:38] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez 
[08:41:51] <gnarf> It might be the "proxy" host problem we solved on the grunt-wordpress stuff
[08:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/cf14e840fa177ea11f9b
[08:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's the page not loading because of thousands of duplicate versions being processed.
[08:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/peity/ shows you what's coming back from the XML-RPC call.
[08:58:41] <gnarf> well thats 
[08:58:43] <gnarf> ....
[08:59:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i turned it off
[09:00:03] <gnarf> on jq02
[09:00:04] <gnarf> so like
[09:00:12] <gnarf> do we have a plan?
[09:00:25] <gnarf> do you need my help with any part(s) of it?
[09:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> No plan.
[09:09:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: kborchers: s5fs: afk for a bit, but perhaps we should have a quick discussion on Skype?
[12:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around?
[12:51:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: kinda
[12:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> Can you just kill the part of the plugins.jquery.com deployment script that starts the /etc/init.d service?
[12:52:41] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to kill of the scripts, but want to be able to continue deploying.

[15:06:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: testing this now
[15:06:50] <gnarf> it should no longer auto-restart the scripts, but the deploys might
[15:07:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nevermind
[15:07:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i cn either ensure its running, or ensure its stopped
[15:07:19] <gnarf> no other choice

[15:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: How is "act is if it doesn't even exist" not a choice?
[15:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ensuring its stopped is fine for now though.
[15:29:41] <scott_gonzalez> I modified it to not do anything anyway.
