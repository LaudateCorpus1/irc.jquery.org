[02:45:14] <Krinkle> s5fs: gnarf: It seems cloudfront is caching .css for 24 hours
[02:45:22] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/7
[02:45:41] <Krinkle> causing a minor display disruption as I made a bugfix to the html and css.
[02:45:44] <Krinkle> but they're now out of sync
[02:46:59] <Krinkle> I guess it should have a cache buster query string maybe
[05:49:32] <gnarf> in the tests? or like on the UI?
[06:41:03] <Krinkle> gnarf: UI
[06:41:50] <Krinkle> gnarf: If we start proxying jenkins. or jenkins-build. sites, we don't actually mind cache much since they all have unique hashed directories
[06:46:38] <gnarf> Krinkle: okay - I kicked it into development mode which should clear the cache
[06:46:55] <Krinkle> Yup
[06:46:57] <Krinkle> Fixed
[06:47:39] <Krinkle> Still setting Cache-Control:max-age=86400 , but without 'public'
