[01:44:33] <Krinkle> gnarf: Can you see which table?
[01:44:48] <Krinkle> It's probably not the job table. That does grow, but not that much.
[01:44:54] <Krinkle> I reckon it's run results
[01:45:32] <Krinkle> contains HTML (serialised active DOM) of each browser ever run a test suite

[06:03:24] <jzaefferer> gnarf: sorry for the delay, landed both changes now. 
[06:03:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf: after two hours, the redirect is still not in place. Running puppet manually on jq01.jquery.com aborts with this error: 
[06:04:01] <jzaefferer> Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Duplicate declaration: Package[apache2.2-bin] is already declared in file /etc/puppet/manifests/nodes/webhost.pp:4; cannot redeclare at /etc/puppet/modules/wordpress/manifests/init.pp:47 on node jq01.jquery.com

[06:04:01] <jzaefferer> Error: Could not retrieve catalog; skipping run
[06:04:26] <jzaefferer> Either I'm doing it wrong or something is broken
[07:14:38] <Krinkle> gnarf: pong on cc puppet commit, what do you want me to review?
[07:14:52] <Krinkle> I see the checked in code and paths does not match what's currently deployed
[07:15:02] <Krinkle> so these paths are either unused or did you update those to use these?
[11:20:04] <arschmitz> gnarf: no no demos and themeroller don't need to be on the same server they both can be anywhere that is most convenient

[18:47:58] <s5fs> gnarf: ping jq01 is down :(
[18:48:03] <s5fs> nginx is segfaulting
[18:48:37] <s5fs> good news is that jorn's puppet changes are in place haha! too bad we'll never know if they'll work
[18:50:23] <arschmitz> s5fs: your right on top of it this time
[18:51:08] <s5fs> arschmitz: that means i probably broke it
[18:51:17] <arschmitz> s5fs: ha ha 
[18:52:48] <arschmitz> s5fs: ok then every one its all s5fs fault he admits it :-)
[18:53:40] <s5fs> i'll wear it once i find root cause
[18:54:48] <arschmitz> s5fs: for now ill take the easy path and blame media temple lol
[18:55:44] <arschmitz> s5fs: if there is anything i can do let me know
[18:55:49] <arschmitz> im just working on slides for my talk
[18:56:59] <s5fs> will do
[18:57:13] <s5fs> nginx is segfaulting but i cannot repro in a vagrant machine
[18:57:20] <s5fs> so its not a puppet config like i first assumed, so ugh
[18:57:25] <s5fs> likely not, anyways
[18:57:33] <arschmitz> hm 
[19:01:11] <s5fs> i patched the host yesterday but it seemed fine
[19:02:45] <s5fs> i'm rebooting, this is weird
[19:04:04] <s5fs> good, no change in behavior
[19:20:53] <s5fs> okay we're back up
[19:21:25] <s5fs> looks like when nginx upgraded it borked the init script, so i nabbed one from another server, seems okay now
[19:21:39] <arschmitz> sweet
[19:22:32] <arschmitz> s5fs: wasn't too long at least this time :) 
[19:24:49] <s5fs> yayz
[19:26:34] <s5fs> haha this whole thing was just supposed to take a sec. jorn had a little puppet config issue, so i went to test it, only to find that i didn't have vagrant or virtualbox installed (new os)
