[13:17:11] <m_gol> gnarf: ping
[13:18:04] <m_gol> or s5fs ryanneufeld anyone ;)
[13:20:03] <m_gol> `sudo puppet agent --test` doesn't work for me on jq03, I keep getting "Unable to fetch my node definition"
[13:20:16] <m_gol> and then it timeouts
[13:24:59] <gnarf> cc s5fs
[13:25:09] <gnarf> m_gol you might need to manually do whatever change for now
[13:25:20] <gnarf> citadel is getting moved to a different server atm
[13:25:25] <gnarf> so puppet is not gonna do anything
[13:27:40] <s5fs> m_gol: also if nobody reponds quickly on irc, send us an email. i'm always on email :)
[13:28:15] <m_gol> s5fs gnarf: it was nothing urgent, I just updated browsers on infra and wanted to see if the update succeeds :)
[15:38:54] <s5fs> m_gol: give it another shot, host is back up
[15:39:11] <s5fs> we were getting tight on disk space so I initiated an "upgrade" but it got stuck haha
