[07:31:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any idea why the CLA check is failing here? jQuery PR checker says the signature is fine: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/776
[07:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[07:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> Could be the unicode normalization not working?
[07:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do some testing locally.
[07:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, I see the problem.
[07:44:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's a problem I can no longer fix though.
[07:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> Unless kborchers would like to give me write access on the CLA spreadsheeet again.
[07:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> We have tons of people who sign the CLA multiple times.
[07:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> And we only ever look at the first valid signature.
[07:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> The first time he signed, he used two names, not three.
[07:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> So the check is failing.
[07:47:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you have edit now
[07:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Thanks.
[07:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: PR is valid now.
[07:52:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: great, thanks
