[06:44:22] <rworth> can someone help me pull together some analytics on our CDN usage?
[06:45:34] <rworth> ^^ gnarf clarkbox 
[19:52:43] <clarkbox> rworth - have you logged into splunk?
[19:52:53] <clarkbox> let me paste you a baseline search
[19:52:55] <clarkbox> ...
[19:58:18] <clarkbox> sourcetype=access_combined host="cdn.origin.jquery.net"
[19:58:45] <clarkbox> keep in mind that does not represent the actual hits the CDN sees. those are just the requests we get from CDN
[20:03:48] <clarkbox> actually, this might be better
[20:03:48] <clarkbox> sourcetype=access_combined host="*origin*"
