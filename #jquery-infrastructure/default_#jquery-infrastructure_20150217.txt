[06:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to have someone look over that. It solves the clone/fetch race.
[06:36:17] <scott_gonzalez> You might want to review that commit by commit since one of the commits moves a bunch of code into separate files.
[06:42:07] <gnarf> i did
[06:42:11] <gnarf> looks pretty good
[06:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[06:42:14] <gnarf> one thought
[06:42:27] <gnarf> can we run 2 fetches at once either?
[06:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, simultaneous fetches are fine.
[06:42:40] <gnarf> ok
[06:42:45] <gnarf> so long as you tested that
[06:42:46] <gnarf> :)

[06:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I have a test file that runs six fetches on the same branch and seven PRs all at the time same.
[06:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> wow, I just transposed those last two words.
[12:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs gnarf: FYI: I was just removed from the infra repo.
[13:19:17] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: was that intentional?
[13:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> I believe it was The Powers That Be not understanding the repercussions of their actions.
[13:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> I was removed from Owners, but I was added back.
[13:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see if I get to stay...
