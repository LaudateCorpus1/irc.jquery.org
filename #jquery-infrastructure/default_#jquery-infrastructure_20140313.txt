[17:27:31] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15Krinkle opened issue #250: Link "Browse Source" on bugs.jquery.com broken 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/250
[17:27:53] <Krinkle> Oh, better be careful with putting sensitive stuff in titles.
[17:28:00] <Krinkle> Didn't realise issues would be listed here
[17:28:08] <Krinkle> makes sense (commits do as well)
[17:29:18] <s5fs> Krinkle: haha! no worries, lemme try to fix this for you real quick
[17:30:01] <Krinkle> Assuming the /browse redirect is not powered by Trac itself, I assume we can fix both (Have Trac point to github directly, and fix that broken redirect)
[17:35:02] <s5fs> Krinkle: yeah i'm trying to find where Browse Source is configured, no luck so far :/
[17:35:05] <s5fs> man trac is big

[17:37:17] <s5fs> haha indeed
[17:37:34] <s5fs> Krinkle: thanks for splitting the cab w/me to the airport, i hope to catch up more in ch icago
[17:38:31] <Krinkle> Haven't heard much about that, but would like to be there
[17:40:51] <s5fs> Krinkle: looks like it's correctly configured but not being referenced: https://gist.github.com/aulvi/d98406d3fb6b39afef74
[17:41:56] <Krinkle> Indeed, trac's github integration is disabled as far as I'm concerned
[17:42:05] <Krinkle> links to commits never worked, or at least not for at least a year
[17:43:14] <s5fs> Krinkle: yes, i'm trying to carve out time to work in. i hope to spend 3 or so days next week doing pretty much just that.
[17:43:45] <Krinkle> sorry, to work what?
[17:43:49] <Krinkle> trac?
[17:44:46] <s5fs> yes correct
[17:44:54] <s5fs> i'll try to fix what i can but i'm mostly angling to upgrade
[17:45:10] <Krinkle> hopefully that'll fix more than it breaks :)
[17:45:18] <Krinkle> (It is trac..)
[17:46:25] <s5fs> haha!
[17:46:50] <s5fs> i'm currently working on documenting the restore process, that's the first step in setting up a test env
[17:47:08] <s5fs> its not puppetized so i'm writing that part out too (where appropriate)
[17:49:24] <Krinkle> cool
[17:51:01] <s5fs> Krinkle: alright well i don't think the link deal is gunna be fixed right this second, i'll keep working on it and close the ticket when it's fixed. sorry i'm not up to speed on this product yet, i will be soon.
[17:51:46] <Krinkle> no worries, I just recorded it as an observation, didn't think someone would look at it right away. Thanks :)
[17:52:04] <Krinkle> maybe the newer version has a better control panel
