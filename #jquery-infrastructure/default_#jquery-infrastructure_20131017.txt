[06:02:11] <kborchers> hey anyone around to bounce mysql on bugs.jqueryui.com? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/210
[06:02:53] <kborchers> gnarf: clarkbox s5fs ^^ i'm honestly not sure who all has access
[07:33:14] <dregad> hello, http://bugs.jquery.com/ is down, are you guys aware of that ?
[07:33:43] <dregad> OperationalError(2002, "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (111)")
[08:26:22] <kborchers> dregad: thanks for letting us know. i noticed it this morning and pinged a few folks. hopefully as the people who can fix it come online and notice they will take care of it
[08:26:48] <dregad> kborchers cheers :-)
[09:26:44] <s5fs> crap, I'm just getting on to a call, I'll jump on the issue shortly
[09:28:57] <gnarf> bugs should be back up
[09:29:00] <gnarf> drive space
[09:29:07] <s5fs> gnarf: thanks
[09:29:27] <kborchers> thanks gnarf 
[10:24:38] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: oh, I restarted mysql... guess that wasn't the issue :P
[10:32:14] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: I tried to sudo and it said out of drive space
[10:32:31] <gnarf> but "df" is always my first check on a down machine
[10:32:34] <gnarf> its usually the reason
[10:33:30] * ryanneufeld will keep that in mind next time
[11:09:06] <s5fs> seems like it's always disk space
[11:09:34] <s5fs> gnarf: thanks again for taking care of that, i popped on just as my meeting started (i host a weekly call) and saw the errors. yuck!
[11:11:14] <gnarf> also cc s5fs ryanneufeld - do you mind if kborchers or another board member rings your phones after mine in emergencies like that that go unanswered for too long in irc?
[11:11:39] <ryanneufeld> you can sms me
[11:11:46] <ryanneufeld> I may not be able to take a call
[11:11:49] <s5fs> gnarf: feel free to call anytime
[11:11:54] <ryanneufeld> but you can sms me, or get me on google talk
[11:12:02] <ryanneufeld> gtalk is probably the fastest way to get me
[11:12:13] <kborchers> cool, thanks guys
[11:12:17] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin danheberden etc - if something is down, feel free to SMS/GTalk (in my case dial) our phones :)
[11:12:21] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: you have my gtalk right?
[11:12:28] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: yeah
[11:12:31] <ryanneufeld> cool
[11:12:32] <s5fs> voice or text or email all lands at the same device, so whatever works best and feels appropriate
[11:12:35] <ryanneufeld> I'm on all the time
[11:12:49] <gnarf> that was like 3 or 4 hours of waiting on us :)
[11:12:58] <ryanneufeld> shit
[11:13:02] <gnarf> we all showed up at the same time today tho
[11:13:04] <s5fs> yeah, that's no good
[11:13:04] <gnarf> which was funny
[11:13:06] <ryanneufeld> haha
[11:13:14] <ryanneufeld> timezones
[11:13:16] <s5fs> three stooges never miss a meal together
[11:13:27] <gnarf> i slept in due to headache
[11:13:39] <gnarf> took some aleeve and crashed back out - sent email to work with phone
[11:13:46] <gnarf> didn't even look at laptop :)
[11:13:59] <s5fs> normally i start work around 10-11a but today is my special meeting day so i got in at 8a. i was totally free until 9:30a, when i noticed the problem haha!
[11:14:44] <ryanneufeld> I'm usually at work around 9am
[11:14:52] <ryanneufeld> but not avail till around 9:30 usually
[11:15:54] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i don't have your canadian phone number, mind texting it to me so i can text you in the future?
[11:16:23] <ryanneufeld> pm'd s5fs
[11:18:22] <s5fs> thanks, your contact has been updated :)
[12:12:41] <timmywil> bugs.jquery.com seems to be hanging indefinitely
[12:15:49] <ryanneufeld> timmywil: back
[12:15:56] <ryanneufeld> looks like trac crashed
[12:16:00] <ryanneufeld> had to restart it
