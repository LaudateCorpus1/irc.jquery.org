[12:49:09] <jzaefferer> gnarf: let's look at puppetizing Jenkins again? I'm kind of sick of editing 13 jobs, making the same change to all of them, like I did today
[12:49:37] <jzaefferer> gnarf: in the end it saves an xml file, which puppet could manage, then (safe) restart jenkins after a config change...
[12:49:53] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sure
[12:50:26] <jzaefferer> of course there's something for puppet jenkins integration already: https://forge.puppetlabs.com/rtyler/jenkins
