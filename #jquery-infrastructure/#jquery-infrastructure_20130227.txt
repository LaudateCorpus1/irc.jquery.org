[00:16:29] <gnarf> danheberden: so it seems the new policy for like everything is "open a support request in ac.mediatemple.net"
[00:16:37] <gnarf> i'm okay with this
[00:17:14] <gnarf> also
[00:17:31] <gnarf> I'm trying to remember how to get this firehose not as - well - firey
[00:17:53] <danheberden> "new ticket: my bourbon bottle is empty - please refill"
[00:18:02] <danheberden> gnarf: re: zabix
[00:18:12] <danheberden> i made a filter/label - i'm kind of scared to click on it
[00:18:19] <gnarf> you can just delete em all
[00:18:20] <gnarf> really
[00:18:36] <gnarf> you don't need to read like any of it most likely
[00:18:41] <gnarf> but
[00:18:45] <gnarf> if i can get it setup right
[00:18:47] <gnarf> what i want
[00:18:48] <gnarf> is 
[00:18:57] <gnarf> any alarm, sends an email after 10 minutes of being an alarm
[00:19:14] <gnarf> and again every 24 hours that it is still an alarm
[00:19:26] <gnarf> no email for "recovery"
[00:20:00] <gnarf> but really
[00:20:09] <gnarf> its just a reminder to look at the dashboard
[00:20:15] <gnarf> and see whats up with that broken alarm
[00:20:15] <gnarf> :)
[00:20:56] <gnarf> i've just been deleting em all every now and then to see if my settings have made any changes
[00:21:10] <gnarf> i really really want to find someone to fund a node version of that
[00:21:17] <gnarf> (zabbix)
[00:22:03] <gnarf> with some tiny c compiled agents
[00:22:09] <gnarf> but like
[00:22:27] <gnarf> i've never seen a version of that sort of monitoring product that is actually doing everything i want it to
[00:22:31] <gnarf> easily
[00:22:44] <gnarf> zabbix gets the closest
[00:22:49] <gnarf> but its notifications are a pain
[00:43:23] <gnarf> clarkbox danheberden ryanneufeld - btw - I plan on doing an infra meeting today
[00:44:20] <danheberden> gnarf, i'll do my best to attend - work has been pulling me sideways
[00:44:32] <gnarf> understandable
[00:44:44] <gnarf> live has been pulling me
[00:44:55] <danheberden> but i thought we deprecated that?
[00:44:57] <danheberden> :p
[00:44:58] <gnarf> ryanneufeld - I just went through and did apt-get update on all the servers
[00:45:32] <gnarf> we are now on puppet 3
[00:45:32] <gnarf> yay
[01:13:19] <gnarf> in other news
[01:13:23] <gnarf> i think i tamed the firehose

[08:12:35] <Krinkle> gnarf: Hm..
[08:23:16] <gnarf> woah crazy
[09:04:34] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you're on a roll buddy
[09:23:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how would you spawn this in node: git archive 1cc5e6a001907a604b71946310149d0f7cb7c7b7 | tar -x -C ../public_html/test/
[09:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I haven't piped before.
[09:23:06] <gnarf> (in the right channel) ;)
[09:23:19] <gnarf> ill ask in #node.js
[09:29:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the suggestion they had was make a .sh script that runs the command
[09:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Check options.stdio for spawn.
[09:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options
[09:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if you can pipe multiple spawns together though.
[09:31:59] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe use streams?
[09:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> Stream the output from one spawn to the input of another?
[09:36:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the suggestion they had was make a .sh script that runs the command
[09:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but that sounds like a hack around the problem.
[09:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> child_process.spawn lets you control the stdio.
[09:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> I assume this is to allow you to pipe.
[09:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, you're comfortable with shell scripting, so it's not an issue.
[09:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd be surprised if that was the answer you would get from someone like Isaac.
[09:40:34] <ryanneufeld> some times you need a hammer, sometimes you need a jackhammer
[09:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.219431.12
[09:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes you need a hammer factory factory
[09:46:40] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: http://i.qkme.me/35w9vq.jpg
[09:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:49:45] <ryanneufeld> man, 15mins with sympfony and i already hate it
[09:51:43] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: heh
[09:51:56] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: have you used it?
[09:52:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: mind doing a quick review of this code w/ me after the meeting
[09:52:24] <gnarf> just wanna make sure I'm not totally off the rails
[09:52:28] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: you should start working on drupal
[09:52:42] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: yah, that might happen sooner than later methinks
[09:52:47] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i used it for like 10 mintutes then decided that ZF was a niceer headache
[09:52:53] <danheberden> MOAR SINGLETONS
[09:52:56] <gnarf> though, cake i actually found half okay
[09:53:02] <gnarf> for quick shit
[09:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: sure
[09:53:06] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I hated cake too
[09:53:14] <danheberden> i LOVED cake
[09:53:16] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i hear laravel is the new hotness
[09:53:19] <gnarf> for php frames
[09:53:24] <gnarf> if you aren't locked in already
[09:53:29] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yeah, our new stuff from corp is symfony
[09:53:34] <ryanneufeld> so we're locked in
[09:53:37] <danheberden> i liked cake way more than symfony
[09:53:54] <gnarf> i hated em all, but cake > zf > symfony from experience
[09:53:55] <ryanneufeld> I don't like that they have magic models
[09:54:00] <danheberden> i wonder where the thing i wrote for it went
[09:54:03] <danheberden> it's probably really embarassing now
[09:54:06] <ryanneufeld> that just magically appear and work
[09:54:18] <ryanneufeld> I like CodeIgniter
[09:54:25] <ryanneufeld> but even it has it's drawbacks
[09:54:31] <ryanneufeld> like being waaaay behind the times
[09:54:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/node-web-git-proxy/commit/3606bc2ace45c82ef160f7f7dcc85af84569ff4a
[09:54:39] <gnarf> oops
[09:54:44] <ryanneufeld> for the sake of supporting ooold php versions
[09:54:44] <gnarf> forgot config.json.template
[09:55:28] <gnarf> i kinda figured i'd just make "grunt" my entry point for now
[09:55:55] <gnarf> i mean, if i copy over the html part, this already does what the python one does
[09:56:48] <danheberden> hahaha i found it! https://gist.github.com/danheberden/e48d2653cc317d1a24d4
[09:57:18] <ryanneufeld> WTF IS THIS php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition path/ 2.1.8
[09:57:19] <danheberden> it was actually really handy - you could return data to your view and either a) return data and render the html or b) just send the data if it was an ajax request
[09:57:22] <ryanneufeld> whoops
[09:57:25] <ryanneufeld> wrong window
[09:57:26] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:57:32] <danheberden> and it would persist data between internal redirects
[09:57:45] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: I don't like your indentation
[09:57:55] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: it got all goofed in dropbox
[09:58:02] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: sure sure...
[09:58:05] <danheberden> haha
[10:00:01] <danheberden> god now i wonder what other shit code i wrote
[10:03:23] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: did you know that puppet has their own vagrant boxes now?
[10:04:31] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nice
[10:04:31] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/debian-606-x64.box for example
[10:04:50] <ryanneufeld> oh, and you wanna build your own? https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vagrant-boxes
[10:05:06] <gnarf> i still think i like the idea of using our own dropbox url tho
[10:05:16] <ryanneufeld> for sure
[10:23:07] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: are you building https://github.com/danheberden/bear ?
[10:23:43] <danheberden> oh, it's gnarf's
[10:26:47] <gnarf> danheberden: https://github.com/gnarf37/node-notifier-server
[10:26:58] <gnarf> danheberden: me, ryanneufeld and now vlad are using it
[10:27:17] <ryanneufeld> it's working really well
[10:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Seems sane.
[10:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> I left a few comments, but nothing too important.
[10:34:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool
[10:34:25] <gnarf> yeah, thanks
[10:34:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: input on a "buildCommand" option?
[10:35:23] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[10:35:40] <gnarf> I was thinking about allowing a "buildCommand" to run "grunt" for instance on jquery
[10:35:48] <gnarf> because it needs built files to work
[10:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[10:36:11] <gnarf> but since it spawns across multiple tags
[10:36:59] <gnarf> i think it might have to just be a single .sh file that gets called 
[10:37:22] <gnarf> to check for proper build
[10:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> That gets tricky.
[10:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> Because you might have different commands for different tags.
[10:38:04] <gnarf> exactly
[10:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> So the script would need to live outside the code repo.
[10:38:19] <gnarf> you could do like if [ -f Gruntfile.js ]
[10:38:28] <gnarf> i was thinking ./build-command.sh
[10:38:30] <gnarf> if it was there
[10:38:34] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:38:37] <gnarf> it execed it with pwd = to the checkout
[10:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[10:39:10] <gnarf> maybe $1 === tag/branch.name
[10:57:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez ryanneufeld Krinkle danheberden clarkbox: -meeting in a few
[10:58:00] <ryanneufeld> kk
[10:58:06] <ryanneufeld> I'll be idling in there
[12:05:39] <gnarf> btw: just got the disk upgraded on citadel
[12:05:42] <gnarf> we were running low
[12:05:58] <gnarf> seems they upped the ram too
[12:10:00] <ryanneufeld> how kind
[12:40:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: new bash trick
[12:40:20] <gnarf> { ..... } > file.out
[12:40:21] <gnarf> :)
[12:53:31] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: wassat do?
[12:55:01] <gnarf> basically, { } make a subshell
[12:55:08] <gnarf> but you can redirect the whole subshell
[12:55:10] <gnarf> or pipe it
[12:55:11] <gnarf> etc
[12:55:26] <ryanneufeld> stdin and out?
[12:55:29] <gnarf> yup
[12:55:48] <gnarf> { cmd1; cmd2 } < in > out 2> err
[12:56:13] <ryanneufeld> oh, so you still have to redirect stdrr
[12:56:19] <ryanneufeld> neat
[12:56:29] <gnarf> it inherits by default
[12:56:32] <ryanneufeld> I've been a fan of $() lately
[12:56:46] <gnarf> $() acutally gives output tho
[12:57:03] <gnarf> but yeah
[12:57:04] <gnarf> its good
[12:57:39] <ryanneufeld> well $() lets you treat the output as a variable
[12:57:41] <ryanneufeld> bash is neat
[12:57:44] <johnbender> gnarf: [] too right?
[12:57:59] <johnbender> re subshell
[12:58:03] * johnbender goes to google 
[12:58:07] <ryanneufeld> [ === test
[12:58:42] <johnbender> ah you are correct
[12:58:42] <johnbender> hmm
[12:58:53] <johnbender> now I'm tryign to figure out why I thought it was a subshell
[12:58:54] <gnarf> $[ 10 - 5 ]
[12:58:55] <gnarf> ?
[12:59:12] <johnbender> maybe [] == `test` in a subshell?
[12:59:40] <ryanneufeld> well the ] is optional
[13:00:05] <ryanneufeld> oh
[13:00:07] <ryanneufeld> I lied
[13:00:09] <ryanneufeld> it's not apparent
[13:00:35] <gnarf> there is a /bin/[ 
[13:00:38] <gnarf> which === test
[13:00:39] <gnarf> but 
[13:01:13] <ryanneufeld> ryan@ryanmacmini:~$ \ls -l /bin/[ 
[13:01:13] <ryanneufeld> -r-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  43120 16 Mar  2012 /bin/[
[13:01:22] <ryanneufeld> apparently on OSX it's it's own binary
[13:01:41] <gnarf> strings /bin/[ and strings /bin/test are the same
[13:01:43] <ryanneufeld> but it's hard linked to test apparently
[13:02:23] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/3i163B1w0i3o
[13:02:25] <ryanneufeld> same inode
[13:02:28] <ryanneufeld> interesting
[13:02:39] <ryanneufeld> it must have logic in it that checks how it was called
[13:02:44] <ryanneufeld> not surprising
[13:02:56] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: more likely bash handles bare [ and ] differently
[13:03:14] <gnarf> but $0 === [ would be pretty easy to do too :)
[13:03:27] <ryanneufeld> yup
[13:04:39] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: does vagrant use sudo for setting up nfs exports?
[13:04:59] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: on the host yes
[13:05:07] <ryanneufeld> excellent
[13:05:08] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: or at least that's what I recollect
[13:05:15] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: don't quote me on that though]
[13:05:19] <ryanneufeld> that means I can make it sudo nopass
[13:05:30] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: worth a try
[13:05:32] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: let me know
[13:05:40] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: working on a digital ocean provider for fun
[13:05:53] <ryanneufeld> ohyeah?
[13:06:05] <ryanneufeld> I'd love to have one for VMware and or parallels
[13:06:14] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: vmware is on it's way
[13:06:24] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: but it's going to be licensed
[13:06:34] <ryanneufeld> like, paid?
[13:06:37] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yah
[13:06:47] <ryanneufeld> boo :(
[13:06:50] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: that's how mitch is going to feed himself
[13:06:55] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: he's working on vagrant full time
[13:06:59] <ryanneufeld> yeah, i know
[13:07:09] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: open source aws provider soon too
[13:07:25] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I suppose i could always write my own provider :P
