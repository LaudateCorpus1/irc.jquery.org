[10:03:40] <rwaldron_> mgol jzaefferer danheberden Krinkle ryanneufeld I don't know who to ask about any of this these days... I used to use the irc.jquery.com bouncer until recently (I'm not sure why, but it was misbehaving). I connected directly to freenode, but now I can't use my registered nick ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can someone email me whatever credentials I need to get back onto irc.jquery.com?
[10:03:42] <rwaldron_> Thanks!
[10:07:38] <rwaldron_> This is what I get when I try to use my registered nick:	rwaldron!rwaldron@gateway/shell/jquery.com/x-dzpylnbmgloxeuii has just authenticated as you (rwaldron)
