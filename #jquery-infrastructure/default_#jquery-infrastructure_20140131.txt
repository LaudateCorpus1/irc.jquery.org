[09:43:17] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf
[09:43:37] <gnarf> yo
[09:43:55] <ryanneufeld> any objections to me adding vagrant.jquery.com to point to 33.33.33.200 ?
[09:43:57] <ryanneufeld> for the vm?
[09:58:04] <ryanneufeld> gnarf?
[09:58:30] <gnarf> is 33.33.33. special somehow for vagrant?
[09:58:37] <ryanneufeld> seems to be
[09:58:47] <ryanneufeld> though, I think we can use any ip range
[09:58:49] <ryanneufeld> lemme test
[09:58:53] <ryanneufeld> do you have a preference?
[09:59:15] <gnarf> well
[09:59:26] <gnarf> 33.x seems to be a DOD ip block
[09:59:43] <gnarf> dunno that i want to point an IP at it :)
[09:59:56] <gnarf> (in our public dns)
[09:59:57] <ryanneufeld> good point
[10:00:10] <gnarf> can we use some rare "reserved" ip block?
[10:00:23] <ryanneufeld> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses
[10:00:37] <ryanneufeld> 192.x?
[10:00:59] <ryanneufeld> 192.168.0.0/16	192.168.0.0 â€“
[10:00:59] <ryanneufeld> 192.168.255.255	65,536	No	Used for local communications within a private network as specified by RFC 1918.
[10:01:12] <ryanneufeld> seems like a good one to use
[10:01:21] <ryanneufeld> it's not routed to the public internet
[10:01:37] <gnarf> so that is a popular one
[10:01:42] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:01:47] <gnarf> most routers use that range
[10:01:50] <ryanneufeld> I was thinking it was 168. sometyhing
[10:01:56] <gnarf> 172.16.0.0/12
[10:02:06] <ryanneufeld> 169.254.0.0/16	169.254.0.0 â€“
[10:02:06] <ryanneufeld> 169.254.255.255	65,536	No	Used for autoconfiguration between two hosts on a single link when no IP address is otherwise specified, such as would have normally been retrieved from a DHCP server, as specified by RFC 5735.
[10:02:19] <ryanneufeld> yeah, 172 could work
[10:02:20] <ryanneufeld> lemme test
[10:02:21] <gnarf> 10.x and 192.168.x are the common ones
[10:02:27] <gnarf> its a /12
[10:02:58] <gnarf> so we can go like 172.27.72.###
[10:03:27] <ryanneufeld> okay
[10:03:29] <ryanneufeld> I'll try 172.27.72.27
[10:04:13] <gnarf> should be easy to remember :)
[10:04:23] <gnarf> not that we'll ever need to "know" it

[10:06:28] <ryanneufeld> Wanna go with that?
[11:45:41] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i was pinging last night because i broke zabbix haha
[11:59:10] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: I don't know that I would have been able to help you with that
[13:42:16] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: haha maybe not but it was late and i figured why not
[13:42:48] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: long story short, an apt-get upgrade brought zabbix up from 1.8.2 to 2.0.9 and i had to manually update the db before it would work again.
[13:43:17] <s5fs> the process is easy enough but i wasn't sure if that was a normal occurrance or if i was just unlucky. reviewing the dpkg.log showed it was unique and i was just lucky.
[14:44:00] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: fun stuf
[15:26:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[18:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I've got a few minutes.
[18:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> My parents are in town.
[18:04:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no worries
[18:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[18:43:58] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf s5fs you guys get the helix sorted?
[18:44:33] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: not really
[18:46:30] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: what was the verdict?
[18:47:06] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: we've got a note out for Arman, hopefully he responds with some info on what features we have available
[18:47:24] <ryanneufeld> ok
[18:47:42] <s5fs> we have access and can run some of the openstack tools, but i'm not sure how to migrate volumes and whatnot to other hosts, the tools throw 400s and 404s
[18:47:52] <s5fs> (which makes me think we may not have perms or something)
[18:48:39] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:49:30] <s5fs> are you sending me a video call?
[18:49:47] <ryanneufeld> I yam
[18:49:54] <s5fs> lemme reboot, i just patched and now hangouts keeps crashing, brb
