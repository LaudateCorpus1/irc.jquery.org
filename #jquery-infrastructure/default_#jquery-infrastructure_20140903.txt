[09:46:25] <ryanneufeld> @gnarf you working on MT domain stuffs?
[09:46:26] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: st - 8☹☺ MAYBE!
[09:46:52] <kborchers> i was just about to ask that ryanneufeld 
[09:46:56] <kborchers> or you s5fs_ ?
[09:55:09] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: I think that they requested this change a while ago, it could be that (MT) is just catching up on it's support queue
[09:55:38] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: s5fs_ also just emailed asking about it :p cc gnarf
[12:05:04] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: welcome back
[12:09:48] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: thx
[12:36:28] <s5fs> kborchers: haha yeah, i wasn't happy when the first email of the morning was "ssh and sshd changed on jq01"
[12:36:41] <s5fs> as the other notifications rolled in, it started making more sense
[12:36:53] <kborchers> :)
