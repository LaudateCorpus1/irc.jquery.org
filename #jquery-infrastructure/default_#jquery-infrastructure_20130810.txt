[00:09:00] <Krinkle> gnarf: The builds.jenkins server is still unreliable.
[00:09:20] <Krinkle> It locks up whenever there's a dozen requests that use php. 
[00:09:25] <Krinkle> I'd rather switch to Apache.
[00:09:40] <Krinkle> I'm not an nginx expert, but whatever it is, this thing is unreliable as it is and I can't improve it.
[00:11:01] <Krinkle> though depending on the cause, Apache wouldn't make a difference
[00:11:13] <Krinkle> e.g. if it is memory related with regards to php and it's vmem
[00:12:19] <Krinkle> it's not even doing anything fancy. I don't get why this thing is being so hard.
