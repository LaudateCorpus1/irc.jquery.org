[08:22:03] <m_gol> Krinkle: ping
[08:29:59] <Krinkle> m_gol: pong
[08:32:44] <m_gol> Krinkle: how is the browser list on the front page at http://swarm.jquery.org/ determined?
[08:32:59] <m_gol> I thought it's just all browsers from all browserSet currently defined but there are more of them
[08:33:25] <m_gol> e.g. I don't get where does Opera 25, 26 & 28 come from (note that Opera 29 & 30 are missing but v31 is present)
[08:35:04] <m_gol> same with IE - I'd expect IE8+ to be on the page but there's also IE6 (but no IE7); althought IE6 has a "2 clients online" tooltip so maybe that's why (what does this mean?)
[08:37:03] <Krinkle> m_gol: It includes all userAgents currently in a browserSet, or currently online, or currently needed.
[08:37:18] <Krinkle> Do you see any that don't satisfy that?
[08:37:49] <Krinkle> if IE7 is not shown I guess that means it's not in any browserSet, and there are not more pending jobs from when it was in a browserSet.
[08:38:22] <Krinkle> That's the reason It scans for both, because browserSets can change, but there may still be pending jobs from before that
[08:38:36] <Krinkle> testswarm-browserstack looks directly at needed browsers, regardless of any configured browserSet.
[08:38:46] <m_gol> what would be the online clients for IE6? AFAIK only QUnit was testing on IE6 but they've stopped using TestSwarm 2 weeks ago
[08:38:47] <Krinkle> This also because the API supports creating a job with a manual list of user agents.
[08:39:12] <Krinkle> m_gol: Because IE6 is so slow, BrowserStack has two clients for us that are permanently running
[08:39:19] <Krinkle> They've been online for almost 3 years now
[08:39:36] <m_gol> ha, interesting
[08:39:38] <Krinkle> I think they reboot them from time to time but the slot is always taken
[08:39:46] <Krinkle> We didn't ask for it, but they did it at some point
[08:39:58] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/clients
[08:40:02] <m_gol> I guess they may disable them when QUnit drops IE6 :)
[08:41:49] <m_gol> ok, that explains IE6 but Chrome 42, Firefox 37, Opera 25, 26 & 28 have no online clients and are in no browserSet currently
[08:48:42] <m_gol> Krinkle: hmm, all those browsers have the "n re-runs" message, that's probably why. What does it mean?
[08:58:10] <Krinkle> m_gol: It means they have jobs with assertion errors, which are eligible to try again once.
[08:59:10] <Krinkle> During a job this happens automatically, but if browser workers are scarce, then other runs are prioritised. And testswarm-browserstack currently only spawns new browsers when there is primary need, not merely for re-runs, but it will run the re-runs if there are any and it's spawning it for other reasons.
[08:59:20] <Krinkle> Joining the swarm briefly with those browsers will make it go away
[09:11:01] <m_gol> Krinkle: I've tried but those are old tests that have their pages removed now so it always ends with an error :)
[09:11:10] <Krinkle> Right
[09:11:16] <Krinkle> So delete the jobs from TestSwarm
[09:11:23] <Krinkle> Log in, and press delete on the job page
[09:11:49] <m_gol> k
[09:12:01] <Krinkle> Although joining the swarm will still work
[09:12:11] <Krinkle> Its okay if it fails again. It only tries twice in total
[09:12:14] <Krinkle> 1 re-run
[11:09:11] <m_gol> Krinkle Krinkle_: thanks, it worked. :) Now all the browsers fit on my screen ;)
[12:53:58] <Krinkle> m_gol: cool :)
