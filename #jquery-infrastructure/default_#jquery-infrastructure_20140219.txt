[09:54:32] <gnarf> jzaefferer ^ those packages are installed now
[09:58:28] <jzaefferer> thanks gnarf! Just reran the QUnit job, looking good now: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/QUnit/382/console
[09:58:35] <jzaefferer> Already got past the qunit task
[09:58:47] <gnarf> yay
[09:58:57] <jzaefferer> I like how that only required 4 lines of code :-)
[10:24:08] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/20d417f3b38244458165178d34c206e87b9169ea
[10:24:08] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-master 1420d417f 15JoÌˆrn Zaefferer: TestSwarm: Rename UI's set and remove IE7 and Opera 12.1 per decision today
[10:27:07] <jzaefferer> gnarf: how long does it usually take for a puppet change to get applied?
[10:27:20] <gnarf> immediately if you run it manually
[10:27:28] <jzaefferer> I just checked /var/www/swarm/config/localSettings.json on jq03 and its still the previous file
[10:27:29] <gnarf> sudo puppet agent --test on the target server
[10:27:36] <gnarf> after the commit lands ^
[10:27:51] <gnarf> also please merge any commits to puppet-master into puppet-stage as well
[10:28:02] <gnarf> those two branches should RARELY point at different shas
[10:29:11] <jzaefferer> ah, right; commit to stage, then merge to master, right?
[10:45:25] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: yes, please
[11:21:18] <gnarf> jzaefferer order is insignificant
[11:21:24] <gnarf> jenkins doesn't have a stage
[11:21:30] <gnarf> so there isn't a test spot for it
[11:21:54] <gnarf> order wise, if we were working on something for jq01 though, i'd expect commit to stage, test on jq01.stage then a merge to master
[11:22:50] <gnarf> w/r/t jenkins though - i'd probably commit to master (since its the only place to "test") and then merge to stage
[13:21:44] <gseguin> gnarf: ping
[13:22:16] <gnarf> gseguin sup
[13:23:35] <gseguin> hey, is there a way to re-install the push notifications for Android on ZNC ?
[13:24:26] <gseguin> gnarf: ^
[13:25:17] <gnarf> probably
[13:25:27] <gnarf> need to build a custom znc tho
[13:25:39] <gseguin> do you need a ticket on the infra repo?
[13:25:47] <gnarf> there is one
[13:25:52] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if there's a persistent bug or not, but I updated a few UI tickets and didn't get any email notifications.
[13:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely not getting any new notifications.
[13:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: vagrant is working for arschmitz. He was just using the wrong repo :-)
[14:02:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: okie :)
[14:02:16] <gnarf> DaveMethvin did you ever give it a test run?
[14:04:47] <DaveMethvin> hope to try it tonight gnarf 
[14:24:06] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: are you using my fork, or talking about something else?
[14:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Yes, your fork.
[14:24:23] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I'm gonna get PR's ready tonight
[14:24:38] <ryanneufeld> will you be around?
[14:24:40] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz said that he was having issues, but it turned out he was using the wp-vm branch in the infrastrucure repo.
[14:24:45] <ryanneufeld> oh
[14:24:46] <ryanneufeld> that'll do it
[14:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a meetup tonight.
[14:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> Doing the most exciting thing you can possibly do in node...
[14:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> ...building a chat server
[14:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[14:25:19] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz should have been able to use the contribute box on the infra repo
[14:25:26] <ryanneufeld> just have to run the provisioner 3x
[14:25:48] <ryanneufeld> vagrant up contribute && vagrant provision contribute && vagrant provision contribute
[14:26:05] <arschmitz> yeah i never tried the provision
[14:26:22] <arschmitz> just vagrant up contribute
[14:27:30] <ryanneufeld> so the box you download when you use my fork, already has all that done
[14:27:40] <arschmitz> yeah i got it now
[14:28:05] <ryanneufeld> it's a bug with the mysql puppet module, it wont grant the perms until it knows mysql is there
[14:28:25] <arschmitz> when i used the one in the jquery-wp-content repo it was fine
[14:28:29] <ryanneufeld> and it doesn't know about mysql until the second run, and then apache... well this is why I was pulling my damn hair out
[14:28:31] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:28:32] <ryanneufeld> good
[14:28:37] <ryanneufeld> I'm happy to hear that
[14:28:41] <ryanneufeld> very happy
[14:28:48] <arschmitz> yeah it sounds like a pain
[14:29:02] <ryanneufeld> hence the vm on wp-content
[14:29:08] <arschmitz> but the VM is nice
[14:29:30] <arschmitz> realy easy install 
[14:29:52] <ryanneufeld> yeah, the two tools you need, are easy to install so, that makes life easy
[19:45:00] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: you around? wanted to try your stuff, but first make sure i knew which to use
[22:11:03] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin|away: I am here now
[22:11:54] <ryanneufeld> b-ot: tell DaveMethvin it's currently https://github.com/ryanneufeld/jquery-wp-content on the wp-vm branch
[22:11:54] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: Iâ€™ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
