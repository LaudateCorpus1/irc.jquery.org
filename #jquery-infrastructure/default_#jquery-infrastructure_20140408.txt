[12:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> Can we setup DNS for books.jquery.com?
[12:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have a site for it yet, but not having DNS is preventing WordPress from updating.
[12:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's stupidly in the jquery-wp-content config.
[12:51:17] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: sure, where you want it pointed?
[12:51:41] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: if there is an issue for this, shoot me a link and i'll picard that biz
[12:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> Just point it at the same server as jquery.com
[12:54:07] <scott_gonzalez> Once DNS is working, it should even show a real site. It'll just be totally empty.
[12:55:33] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: okay all set
[12:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> yay, it worked
[12:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:58:00] <s5fs> anytime :D
[12:58:12] <s5fs> ttl is 15min if we need to do something w/it later
