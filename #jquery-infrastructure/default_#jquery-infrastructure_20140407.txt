[09:40:39] <rxaviers> gnarf, ryanneufeld, (cc jzaefferer), guys.. I can't access http://stage.download.jqueryui.com/download although, DB service seems to be running just fine now (now, because I have re-run prepare and restarted the service. It wasn't running fine before)
[11:02:44] <rxaviers> gnarf, ryanneufeld, jzaefferer, ping
[11:23:58] <ryanneufeld> sup rxaviers
[11:24:06] <rxaviers> Hi ryanneufeld
[11:24:28] <rxaviers> Can you help me above?
[11:25:09] <ryanneufeld> I would if I had any clue what that server was supposed to be
[11:25:59] <rxaviers> stage? rxaviers@jq02.stage.jquery.com
[11:26:08] <rxaviers> ops s/rxaviers@//g
[11:26:51] <ryanneufeld> gnarf and s5fs recently did some server moving
[11:26:56] <ryanneufeld> not sure if this was part of it
[11:27:04] <rxaviers> ah!
[11:27:18] <rxaviers> Perhaps, we could wait on them. It's no hurry.
[11:27:21] <rxaviers> right jzaefferer?
[11:37:59] <ryanneufeld> rxaviers: is that url supposed to hit one of the build hosts?
[11:38:42] <rxaviers> http://stage.download.jqueryui.com/download use to hit jq02.stage.jquery.com
[11:40:47] <ryanneufeld> rxaviers: sorry man, gnarf or s5fs would be your best bet on this one
[11:41:00] <rxaviers> sure! thanks for looking into this
[11:41:35] <ryanneufeld> np, sorry I couldn't be more helpful
[11:41:41] <rxaviers> np
[11:50:14] <rxaviers> just opened #259 to keep track
[11:50:17] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15rxaviers opened issue #259: Download Builder unavailable on stage 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/259
[12:12:41] <gnarf> rxaviers: not sure why but "stage.download.jqueryui.com was ending up pointed at the amd builder instead of download builder
[12:13:10] <rxaviers> what's amd builder?
[12:13:14] <gnarf> for mobile
[12:13:32] <gnarf> the nginx had .download.jqueryui.com as an alias
[12:13:33] <rxaviers> ah! ok thanks
[12:13:49] <gnarf> apparently it wasn't "priority" enough or something - i added stage. to be explicit and it fixed the problem
[12:14:01] <rxaviers> thanks! ;)
[12:24:34] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: was that a nginx config, or DNS change?
[12:25:20] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nginx - just basically on the list of "host names" for the server
[12:25:37] <ryanneufeld> ah
[12:28:17] <gnarf> .download.jqueryui.com >should< be like *.download
[12:28:36] <gnarf> but once i added stage.download.jqueryui.com to the nginx config it worked
[12:28:38] <gnarf> so whatevs
