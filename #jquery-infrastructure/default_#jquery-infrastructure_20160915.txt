[11:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz s5fs: We're getting service timeouts when delivering webhooks to the builder.
[11:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> They're intermittent though.
[11:59:54] <arschmitz> weird maybe the server is under heavy load though not sure why it would be
[12:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm redelivering payload and it seems to be working now.
[12:02:13] <arschmitz> ok that might be what im seeing
[12:02:26] <arschmitz> i logged into server and jqdeploy process was ovwr 100% cpu usage
[12:02:34] <arschmitz> but its probably that hook running
[12:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> And now I'm getting a bunch of timeouts again
[12:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> Download builder is throwing errors when you try to download.
[12:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think it just hasn't deployed properly.
[12:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> Works if I download 1.11.4, which the old version would have.
[12:10:48] <arschmitz> the server does not seem to be low on resources
