[07:58:40] <git-commit> [13testswarm-browserstack] 15mzgol opened pull request #40: API: Update to BrowserStack API v.3 (06master...06api-v3) 02https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/pull/40
[07:59:52] <gnarf> m_gol: ^ does that work when you run it locally?
[08:00:29] <m_gol> do I need the whole TestSwarm infrastructure for that to have set up locally to check?
[08:00:39] <gnarf> nope
[08:00:52] <gnarf> just grab the config.json from jq03
[08:00:52] <m_gol> ok, so how to best check it?
[08:01:05] <gnarf>  /tools/testswarm-browserstack
[08:01:10] <m_gol> I grabbed one & changed browserstack in the URL to mgol
[08:01:43] <gnarf> and if you run the script (look at run.sh on jq03 for command line opts)
[08:01:48] <gnarf> and make a build
[08:01:53] <gnarf> does it send ie 11's ? :)
[08:02:17] <gnarf> (you might want to stop the crontab/kill testswarm-browserstack on jq03)
[08:02:22] <jzaefferer> m_gol: let's discuss here then
[08:02:38] <m_gol> ok
[08:02:55] <m_gol> will check
[08:02:57] <jzaefferer> looks like Corey knows more about this then I do :-)
[08:03:49] <gnarf> m_gol: feel free to use the real jquery creds for running a test
[08:04:00] <gnarf> you should be able to run testswarm-browserstack locally 
[08:04:15] <gnarf> and watch it do it's job if you do a jenkins build
[08:05:13] <gnarf> m_gol: want me to comment out the /etc/crontab line that launches it, and kill the old procs on jq03
[08:05:15] <gnarf> ?
[08:06:11] <m_gol> I can do it
[08:07:14] <m_gol> ok, commented, killed
[08:07:22] <gnarf> cool
[08:07:24] <m_gol> so now I'll try locally on a literally copied config
[08:07:32] <m_gol> node src/cli.js --run
[08:07:33] <m_gol> right?
[08:07:33] <gnarf> launch your local version and spawn a job for it to test on :)
[08:07:52] <gnarf> the shell script here
[08:07:59] <gnarf> uses cli.js --run-loop=60
[08:08:06] <m_gol> ok
[08:08:22] <gnarf> ( /tools/testswarm-browserstack/run.sh )
[08:08:27] <m_gol> ok, executed
[08:08:36] <jzaefferer> "spawn a job" aka "Schedule a build on Jenkins", right?
[08:08:40] <gnarf> run loop sets up the poller
[08:08:49] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yes
[08:09:11] <m_gol> ok, how to check if everything's OK now? :)
[08:09:19] <jzaefferer> Jenkins is currently running a UI build, so it should already need browser
[08:09:22] <jzaefferer> *browsers
[08:09:24] <m_gol> ok
[08:09:29] <m_gol> yeah, I see some logs
[08:09:30] <jzaefferer> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2388
[08:09:51] <jzaefferer> that looks really bad
[08:11:04] <m_gol> you mean test failures or connection issues?
[08:11:07] <m_gol> Safari 6 is waiting
[08:14:01] <m_gol> ok, seems to connect properly, anything else?
[08:18:09] <m_gol> gnarf, can you look? I'd like to disconnect myself
[08:18:57] <gnarf> m_gol: everything seem okay on your console?
[08:19:15] <gnarf> you saw it spawn browsers, specifically ie11, and combat the needed workers until they were 0?
[08:19:49] <m_gol> I'm looking for IE11 in logs now
[08:20:52] <m_gol> hmm
[08:20:55] <m_gol> I only see 7-9
[08:21:20] <gnarf> m_gol: needs to be honorary member of testing and infra teams after the last few days ;)
[08:21:27] <m_gol> ;)
[08:23:37] <m_gol> that's weird
[08:23:49] <m_gol> can you trigger any build that requires IE11 so that I can look again?
[08:24:36] <m_gol> gnarf: everything seems fine, browsers are found, dispatched, the pool gets drained to 0, I just can't find all browsers I'd expect
[08:25:57] <gnarf> m_gol: triggered a jQuery Core 1.x
[08:26:10] <gnarf> m_gol: do you have jenkins login/ability to "build now" or "configure builds" ?
[08:26:22] <m_gol> I don't think so
[08:27:03] <gnarf> m_gol: email you want on the account?
[08:27:23] <m_gol> m.goleb@gmail.com
[08:27:44] <m_gol> OK, I see IE10-11 now :)
[08:27:47] <m_gol> in terminal
[08:30:16] <gnarf> alright
[08:30:52] <gnarf> so jzaefferer mentioned some spacing issues in your pull, he can merge
[08:31:03] <gnarf> that repo needs to be manually updated right now
[08:31:09] <gnarf> i can't admin hooks on it anyway
[08:31:24] <gnarf> so you can do a git pull on the server after he lands and re-enable the cron
[08:33:57] <gnarf> s5fs: ryanneufeld: plans tonight?
[08:34:19] <ryanneufeld> none that I know of
[08:34:36] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ^
[08:35:10] <gnarf> hangout?
[08:51:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you gonna merge that pull?
[08:52:46] <jzaefferer> gnarf: done

[08:53:04] <jzaefferer> there :-)
[08:53:44] <gnarf> m_gol: pull down the code and kick it back to the jq03 service?
[08:53:58] <m_gol> gnarf: will do, I'm updating wiki now
[09:01:37] <m_gol> gnarf: done
[09:07:01] <jzaefferer> m_gol: wiki update looks good; can you expand "kill the process" (which/how?) and "in the main testswarm-browserstack directory" (in your local checkout of 'testswarm-browserstack' might be more clear)?
[09:07:23] <m_gol> jzaefferer: OK. I've divided it into bullet points so you may want to look again
[09:09:04] <m_gol> jzaefferer: wiki updated
[09:09:29] <m_gol> gnarf: the cron task doesn't seem to run...
[09:09:44] <m_gol> `ps aux | grep testswarm` shows nothing
[09:12:14] <jzaefferer> m_gol: I see there were two "kill process" notes. I meant the first one, the one on jq03
[09:12:29] <m_gol> ah, ok ;)
[09:14:13] <m_gol> jzaefferer: check now
[09:14:30] <m_gol> too bad wikis can't have pull requests...
[09:15:12] <jzaefferer> okay, I guess if I or whoever else reads this doesn't know how to actually kill the process, they shouldn't be doing that...
[09:15:26] <jzaefferer> at least now the process name to look for is more obvious
[09:15:36] <m_gol> yes, that's what I thought :)
[09:21:26] <m_gol> ok, no idea why but the process doesn't start and run.log is empty
[09:25:59] <m_gol> gnarf, can you have a look?
[09:30:09] <m_gol> ahh, npm install
[09:30:14] <gnarf> :)

[09:41:19] <m_gol> logs are useful ;)
