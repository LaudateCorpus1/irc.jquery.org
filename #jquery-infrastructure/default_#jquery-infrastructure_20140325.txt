[09:29:25] <s5fs> bugs is borked again, cannot ssh in. rebooting via mt console.
[09:30:35] <s5fs> same story, cpu is pegged
[10:25:17] <gnarf> sigh
[13:35:19] <s5fs> gnarf: yeah was huge disappointment
[14:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> %!@#%!%!#$%!#$%
[14:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> Infrastructure hell today.
[14:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> npm is borked
[14:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> github is borked
[14:02:03] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: whats up
[14:02:24] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: haha, that's the worst! i guard against npm outages by pushing modules into git, now wat!
[14:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[14:02:37] <s5fs> but at least bugs is back up ;)
[14:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> I was trying to publish
[14:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> This is the worst error in the world from `npm publish`:
[14:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> npm ERR! 404 'changelogplease' is not in the npm registry.
[14:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> Well no shit. I was trying to publish it!
[14:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> So I try again, and then I get: npm ERR! publish fail Cannot publish over existing version.
[14:03:14] <s5fs> npm has been a pos for a while now
[14:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so maybe it did publish, go to https://www.npmjs.org/package/changelogplease to see invalid package: changelogplease
[14:03:38] <s5fs> i mean, i put up $7 and still it breaks. do they need another $7 or what?
[14:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> Click the link to submit a bug report, and I get GitHub's angry unicorn.
[14:04:00] <s5fs> haha
[14:04:31] <s5fs> github appears okay for me
[14:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I'll just step away from the computer for a while.
[14:04:36] <s5fs> wait, not submit
[14:04:45] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: yeah go throw a baseball or something
[14:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, looks like it's incorrect error reporting on GitHub's side for this URL:
[14:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> whoa, that's big
[14:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see if this gets me any feedback tonight: https://github.com/npm/npm-www/issues/695
[14:10:51] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: don't wanna ask #Node.js? i don't know who is maintaining npm right now
[14:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's Isaac.
[14:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> He started npm, Inc.
[14:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> So they know have much more than your $7 :-)
[14:11:54] <s5fs> i wasn't sure if he was still on it
[14:12:10] <s5fs> haha i'd just tweet directly at him then
[14:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, he's got a team working on npm now. They raised $2.6M in seed money.
[14:14:07] <s5fs> right i know cj and raquel from a few events and was happy to see the little company form
[14:14:38] <s5fs> i think isaac is great and am confident they will move things forward, but in the meantime its a pain :D
[14:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's been pretty shoddy recently.
[14:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> Should get better though.
[14:17:24] <s5fs> concur
