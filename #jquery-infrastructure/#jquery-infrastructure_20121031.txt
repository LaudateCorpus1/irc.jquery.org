[11:00:57] <clarkbox> yes
[11:01:02] <ryanneufeld> in github's training for git
[11:01:34] <danheberden> gnarf?
[11:03:28] <ryanneufeld> oh, looks like it's over for the day now...
[11:05:49] <ryanneufeld> my training I mean
[12:44:21] <gnarf> clarkbox: they basically apologized for dropping the ball
[12:44:51] <gnarf> the guy in charge of the testing project was out of town, and someone on the team did a maint window not knowing that we had actual testing services running
[12:45:12] <gnarf> I'll work on rebuilding that today
[12:45:24] <gnarf> be warned, the SSH key will change :)
[12:46:05] <ryanneufeld> wat?
[12:46:06] <b-ot> Hi guys? i've posted it on forum, but nobody care, copy bug here why behaviour of
[12:47:05] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: the splunk test machine we had on the helix
[12:47:13] <gnarf> got super corrupted
[12:47:17] <ryanneufeld> ew
[12:47:37] <gnarf> because of some miscommunication between david (the guy heading up the testing) and the team
[12:47:47] <ryanneufeld> boourns
[12:47:54] <gnarf> he basically said
[12:47:58] <gnarf> it won't happen again
[12:47:59] <gnarf> :)
[12:48:09] <ryanneufeld> usually that's the case
