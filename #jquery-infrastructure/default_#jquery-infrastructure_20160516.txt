[11:03:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez https://github.com/gnarf/node-notifier-server/tree/master/notifier.d is a bit of a start, but yeah - i'll put it on my list -- is there something in particular you wanted to know about?
[11:04:25] <gnarf> also scott_gonzalez if you are looking for something newer to use for your own thing, consider https://github.com/brianloveswords/hookshot
[11:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I had mentioned notifier-server to someone in the Node.js Inclusivity WG about managing deployments.
[11:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> And when I linked to the repo, I noticed there wasn't much in terms of docs.
[11:20:20] <gnarf> cheers - i'll add something
