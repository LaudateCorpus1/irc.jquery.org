[10:56:52] <gnarf> s5fs yeah - just don't do anything stupid on live ;)
[10:57:04] <gnarf> you might need to edit the password file too
[16:21:14] <s5fs> gnarf: ok no problem, i'll bang it out later tonight
[20:11:59] <s5fs> gnarf: okay I updated the db on bugs.jquery.com and renamed 'orkel' to 'markelog', sql is in the gist. I didn't see him in the passwd file.
[20:12:07] <s5fs> gnarf: should i create an issue to track this work?
[20:17:07] <gnarf> nah
[20:17:10] <gnarf> no need
[20:26:52] <s5fs> gnarf: okay, no worries. change is made, please check my work. i don't have an acct there yet, haha!
