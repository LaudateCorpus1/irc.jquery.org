[01:18:10] <gnarf> merge that over to puppet-master too
[01:18:22] <gnarf> (merge is fine right now, puppet-stage and puppet-master are in sync)
[01:55:01] <gnarf> clarkbox: there's some issue on jq01
[01:55:08] <gnarf> splunk enable start --no-prompt --answer-yes --accept-license
[01:55:37] <gnarf> Command error: The subcommand 'control' is not valid for command 'enable'.
[09:50:51] <clarkbox> gnarf. i saw that before i went to sleep last night. going to resume fixing now
[11:36:55] <Krinkle|detached> ploink!
[11:37:01] <Krinkle> splunk!
[11:37:33] <Krinkle> I'm eager to find out more about this phenomenon in DC, certainly grabbed by attention.
[12:30:38] <ryanneufeld> any one else having issue with google dns today?
[13:06:02] <clarkbox> ryanneufeld, you should add a note about "git submodule update --init" on vagrant update
[13:06:13] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: good call mate

[13:13:21] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: ^^
[13:14:05] <clarkbox> nice
[23:37:20] <clarkbox> gnarf, its odd that citadel stands up without any errors from splunk module - but on live env its having trouble...
[23:44:25] <clarkbox> i think it may have been due to the unfinished pass when i had the wrong arch/binary...
[23:46:05] <clarkbox> so just an ensure running in the "enable start --no-prompt --answer-yes --accept-license" command i think will do it...
