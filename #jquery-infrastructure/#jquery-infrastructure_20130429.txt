[11:39:22] <DaveMethvin> gnarf ryanneufeld clarkbox do we have download numbers for the cdn?
[11:39:35] <DaveMethvin> or is it hard to get because it's cached ?
[11:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we have access to those numbers.
[11:39:55] <ryanneufeld> I've no idea honestly
[11:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure danheberden had pulled out some figures about something at one point though.
[11:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> That sure was specific, huh?
[11:41:53] <gnarf> we can get total transfer
[11:41:57] <gnarf> and it supports the edgecast api
[11:42:01] <DaveMethvin> i figured oh like in bytes?
[11:42:06] <DaveMethvin> i can do the math :)
[11:42:12] <gnarf> but i don't think we have per file
[11:42:14] <gnarf> or directory
[11:42:28] <DaveMethvin> oh then i need the distribution of files downloaded ... hmmmm 
[11:42:59] <DaveMethvin> also, bytes probably don't include "not modified" and we'd want to know those requests
[11:49:53] <gnarf> you can look up the edgecast api
[11:49:57] <gnarf> and see if something looks promising
[11:50:05] <gnarf> i can get you an account to the api
[13:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: plugins.jquery.com now works with node 0.10.
