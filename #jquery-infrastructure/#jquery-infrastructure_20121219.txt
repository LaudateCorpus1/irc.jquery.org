[05:17:13] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you there?
[05:17:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[05:17:30] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[05:17:35] <DaveMethvin> nice work on grunt btw
[05:17:57] <mikesherov> Oh, thanks. It was a lot of grunt work (no pun intended) that someone had to do
[05:18:03] <mikesherov> so I did it
[05:18:21] <mikesherov> So, I'd like to land the grunt 0.4 stuff. Can you review?
[05:18:26] <DaveMethvin> doing it now
[05:18:48] <mikesherov> awesome, more than code review, I need your windowsy powers to give it a run through
[05:19:15] <DaveMethvin> almost at the bottom, i'll pull and give it a try
[05:19:23] <mikesherov> great, thanks
[05:19:31] <mikesherov> the only other thing to note is that Uglify2 seems to result in about 80 additional bytes to the build
[05:19:44] <DaveMethvin> hmm, wonder why
[05:19:57] <mikesherov> new optimizations that might be worse for gzip
[05:20:05] <mikesherov> it's all heuristics anyway, right?
[05:20:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[05:20:20] <DaveMethvin> it could be something as simple as variable naming order
[05:20:25] <mikesherov> right
[05:20:39] <mikesherov> and there's new mangler, beautfier, and compressor options to toy with
[05:20:48] <mikesherov> so, that's something we should contact Mishoo about, and then throw gibson042 at it
[05:20:48] <DaveMethvin> oh boy, more dials
[05:21:01] <DaveMethvin> oh we should go to -dev
[05:21:11] <mikesherov> oh, wrong room
[05:21:12] <mikesherov> sorry
[07:59:14] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin and mikesherov don't go! it's lonely in here

[12:45:32] <rworth> could not reproduce
[13:17:05] <ryanneufeld> rworth: I also cannot reproduce.
[13:18:46] <ryanneufeld> rworth: I replied.
[13:20:01] <rworth> thanks ryanneufeld 
[13:20:47] <ryanneufeld> np, chances are he has some malware, or something.
