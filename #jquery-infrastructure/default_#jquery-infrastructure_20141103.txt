[08:48:08] <Krinkle> m_gol: I don't have admin rights on the Jenkins install since the last major upgrade a month or so ago. I suspect the user database got lost or reset.
[08:48:23] <Krinkle> It can be granted virally via the UI I think only
[08:48:34] <Krinkle> or... right, its database is an xml file, I can edit that
[08:48:40] <m_gol> Krinkle: I didn't lose an account
[08:48:48] <Krinkle> I stil have the account, but it has no rights
[08:49:00] <m_gol> I can configure jobs
[08:50:30] <m_gol> Krinkle: your last login happened 2m 7d ago according to Jenkins
[08:54:24] <Krinkle> m_gol: Can you check Manage Jenkins, and untick my user, save, re-add? 
[08:55:16] <Krinkle> according to the configuration database I have the permissions
[08:55:18] <m_gol> what do you mean by "untick"?
[08:56:05] <m_gol> each user can be configured or deleted
[08:58:08] <Krinkle> Yeah
[08:58:15] <Krinkle> delete me from that list of extra-rights-having users
[08:58:19] <Krinkle> and re-add with all the boxes that you have
[08:58:47] <m_gol> I don't see any such setting
[08:58:58] <m_gol> Credentials are not visible to me
[08:59:48] <m_gol> there's a list of users at http://jenkins.jquery.com/securityRealm/
[09:00:04] <m_gol> I don't see any other list
[09:00:21] <Krinkle> Access Denied to listing
[09:00:22] <Krinkle> krinkle is missing the Overall/Administer permission
[09:00:53] <Krinkle> Assuming urls havent' changed, based on the WIkimedia Jenkins, it should be at http://jenkins.jquery.com/manage 
[09:00:54] <Krinkle> and then
[09:01:38] <Krinkle> http://jenkins.jquery.com/configureSecurity/
[09:53:16] <arschmitz> gnarf: s5fs: ryanneufeld: deploys are not working for themeroller.jquerymobile.com
[09:53:28] <arschmitz> stage is fine
[09:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's configured for jq03, which isn't working.
[09:54:38] <gnarf> notifier server was crashed on jq03
[09:54:52] <ryanneufeld> that happens from time to time
[09:54:53] <gnarf> what sha should be deployed, i can do it by hand
[09:55:23] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #300: Production deploys for themeroller.jquerymobile.com aren't working 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/300
[09:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> This has been broken for months, FWIW.
[09:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Don't do it by hand.
[09:55:50] <scott_gonzalez> We should do it through a redelivery via GitHub to verify it's working.
[09:55:53] <gnarf> sure
[09:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> Do we know why notifier server has been dying?
[09:56:34] <arschmitz> thats what killed our demo deploy too
[09:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> The service died 3 days ago, so time to fix and/or tracking status after the zabbix emails is something to look into as well.
[09:58:25] <arschmitz> both of the last 2 times we release in September and now the notifier was down
[09:58:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: 3 days ago so it only stayed up for less then a day
[09:59:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: because ryanneufeld fixed it on friday to deploy demos.jquerymobile.com
[09:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that was also manually deployed since it shows all failed deliveries too.
[10:00:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ryanneufeld fixed it both friday and in chicago 
[10:00:23] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: did you manually deploy to fix it?
[10:00:41] <ryanneufeld> I did yes

[10:01:32] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/57c7ad9b870e3c91f41b 
[10:01:41] <ryanneufeld> that is the log from the last commit
[10:02:00] <ryanneufeld> not knowing fully how the notifier works, I'm not sure why it's having a hard time
[10:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> Well looking at the logs from a successful hook isn't going to show the problem :-P
[10:03:19] <ryanneufeld> my point is
[10:03:29] <ryanneufeld> there is nothing I can see that tells me what happened
[10:05:21] <ryanneufeld> in fact, there is nothing in the logs about notifier between Jul 1 and Nov3
[10:06:11] <ryanneufeld> I take that back

[10:06:37] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez, gnarf ^^
[10:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have anything tracking the puppet failures?
[10:07:36] <ryanneufeld> puppet isn't failing
[10:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> I realize that, but puppet failed to update a service.
[10:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> And puppet knows that and is logging it. Are we tracking that anywhere?
[10:09:29] <ryanneufeld> no
[10:11:09] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #301: Track when puppet fails to update services 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/301
[10:12:23] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: from what I'm seeing, puppet is trying to start the service, but it's not starting correctly
[10:12:35] <ryanneufeld> what's wrong with the notifier then?
[10:16:34] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: twofold: 1) we need to figure out why nave is failing 2) the actual notifier-server wasn't up to date (needed a git pull) 
[10:16:59] <ryanneufeld> doesn't puppet manage 2?
[11:17:07] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: no
[11:17:18] <ryanneufeld> should it?
[11:17:25] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: it would install the freshest if it was removed
[11:17:33] <gnarf> it might should
[14:59:22] <ryanneufeld> hahah gnarf
[14:59:29] <ryanneufeld> I just saw the tarsnap email
[14:59:46] <ryanneufeld> and thought "WTF! I didn't authori... oh wait..."
