[06:15:29] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: got this https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/924f05499e891c0b0ac7
[06:15:52] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[06:16:33] <DaveMethvin> `read
[06:16:34] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From ryanneufeld, 8h 4m ago: it's currently https://github.com/ryanneufeld/jquery-wp-content on the wp-vm branch
[06:16:53] <DaveMethvin> thanks b-ot, you're slow and annoying
[07:06:31] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: did that make sense?
[07:07:06] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: i got this error: https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/924f05499e891c0b0ac7
[07:07:44] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: try vagrant box remove jquery-wp-content
[07:07:48] <ryanneufeld> and vagrant up again
[07:07:54] <DaveMethvin> k
[07:07:56] <ryanneufeld> looks like the download got corrupted
[07:08:01] <ryanneufeld> vagrant box list
[07:08:07] <ryanneufeld> will show you which ones you have installed
[07:08:44] <DaveMethvin> doesnt look like any are installed yet
[07:08:49] <DaveMethvin> which kinda makes sense
[07:08:54] <DaveMethvin> the download didn't checksum
[07:09:09] <DaveMethvin> tho now i have a big-ass file somewhere
[07:12:17] <ryanneufeld> it should delete it
[07:12:26] <ryanneufeld> if you open the Vagrantfile
[07:12:30] <ryanneufeld> there is a box_url
[07:12:34] <ryanneufeld> you can manually download it
[07:13:11] <ryanneufeld> and add it with vagrant box add `jquery-wp-content /path/to/downloaded/jquery-wp-content.box`
[07:27:51] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld when i download it manually the sha256sum looks right, but vagrant can't seem to get it right
[07:28:15] <DaveMethvin> i can do the manual setup but for the sake of people actually using this it would be good to figure out why it seems to be getting corrupted
[07:39:14] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: getting a timeout error https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/924f05499e891c0b0ac7
[07:39:22] <DaveMethvin> however, the box seems to be running
[07:39:45] <DaveMethvin> i just can't see it?
[08:01:11] <ryanneufeld> it could be the CDN DaveMethvin
[08:01:51] <DaveMethvin> so how can i connect to this running vm ryanneufeld?
[08:01:59] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I've never seen this before "DL is deprecated, please use Fiddle"
[08:02:09] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: you should be able to navigate to vagrant.jquery.com
[08:02:09] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea what that means
[08:02:14] <ryanneufeld> nor do I
[08:02:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah that doesn't work
[08:02:20] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[08:02:23] <ryanneufeld> you're on windows?
[08:02:26] <DaveMethvin> yep
[08:02:29] <ryanneufeld> ah
[08:02:35] <ryanneufeld> I don't have windozw
[08:02:38] <ryanneufeld> *windows
[08:02:42] <ryanneufeld> what version?
[08:02:46] <DaveMethvin> 8.1
[08:02:52] <ryanneufeld> oh
[08:02:55] <arschmitz> i have a windows 8.1 laptop
[08:02:58] <ryanneufeld> I'm not even sure thats a supported OS for virtualbox
[08:03:07] <DaveMethvin> vbox seems to be working ok
[08:03:12] <arschmitz> i can try on there if you want
[08:03:19] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: if you don't mind
[08:03:20] <DaveMethvin> so arschmitz you tried it earlier?
[08:03:31] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: only on my mac
[08:03:34] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[08:03:57] <DaveMethvin> it could be some firewall setting but usually if a new app tries to get through i am prompted
[08:04:04] <DaveMethvin> and this time no prompts regarding access
[08:04:39] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I dunno man, it tries to setup a private network so you can access 172.27.72.27
[08:04:43] <ryanneufeld> which is what the DNS points at
[08:04:51] <ryanneufeld> can you try vagrant reload?
[08:05:18] <DaveMethvin> so http://172.27.72.27
[08:05:20] <DaveMethvin> ?
[08:05:25] <DaveMethvin> any particular port?
[08:05:45] <ryanneufeld> dns is already pointing vagrant.jquery.com at that ip
[08:05:51] <ryanneufeld> can you even ping it?
[08:05:56] <DaveMethvin> ok no connection anyway
[08:05:57] <ryanneufeld> or traceroute?
[08:05:59] <DaveMethvin> let me try ping
[08:06:11] <DaveMethvin> nope no ping
[08:06:25] <ryanneufeld> okay
[08:06:29] <arschmitz> ok im trying now but will be a bit its my wifes laptop so it does not have vagrant or virtual box
[08:06:36] <ryanneufeld> ok
[08:06:37] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[08:07:41] <DaveMethvin> i can
[08:07:55] <DaveMethvin> this may be relevant
[08:07:56] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2656
[08:07:59] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2656
[08:07:59] <ryanneufeld> haha
[08:08:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I just found that
[08:08:14] <DaveMethvin> beat you by 3 seconds, so i win!
[08:08:38] <DaveMethvin> looks to still be open
[08:08:47] <DaveMethvin> dunno if it's just a warning or actually affects operatoin
[08:09:09] <DaveMethvin> this is a fresh vagrant and i even reinstalled vbox
[08:09:17] <ryanneufeld> it could be the reason the download sha was failing
[08:09:30] <ryanneufeld> can you `vagrant ssh`
[08:09:54] <ryanneufeld> I don't actually know how to use vagrant on windows
[08:11:05] <DaveMethvin> i can .. but ssh to what?
[08:11:22] <ryanneufeld> vagrant ssh will open an ssh connection to the vm
[08:11:28] <ryanneufeld> and drop you into a bash prompt
[08:11:31] <DaveMethvin> oh then it's broken
[08:11:33] <DaveMethvin> can't connect
[08:11:40] <ryanneufeld> gist the output?
[08:11:54] <DaveMethvin> need to wait for the timeout
[08:12:04] <ryanneufeld> k
[08:12:08] <DaveMethvin> it's just sitting there
[08:12:36] <ryanneufeld> CTRL+C
[08:12:40] <ryanneufeld> couple times
[08:12:56] <ryanneufeld> last resort here, try this: vagrant destroy
[08:12:58] <ryanneufeld> then vagrant up again
[08:13:00] <DaveMethvin> sure, but you wanted output?
[08:13:12] <ryanneufeld> it's not gonna be useful
[08:13:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah i didn't think so either
[08:13:21] <ryanneufeld> unless it gives you a specific error
[08:13:24] <DaveMethvin> basically i can't get to hte box
[08:14:03] <ryanneufeld> okay, do you have time later today/tomorrow to get on a google hangout and screenshare?
[08:14:10] <ryanneufeld> or this evening
[08:14:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah we can do that
[08:15:53] <ryanneufeld> ok, i gotta bounce for a bit dave
[08:16:17] <ryanneufeld> you can try the vagrant destroy and vagrant up once more, if that doesn't work, we'll try and figure something out.
[08:56:42] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: this seems to be the problem http://i.imgur.com/A2qRhYv.png
[08:56:52] <DaveMethvin> it's "running" but not really
[08:57:03] <ryanneufeld> ooooh
[08:57:06] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I read about that
[08:57:06] <DaveMethvin> and i am not sure why it says my system can't do that
[08:57:11] <ryanneufeld> you need to turn it on in your Bios
[08:57:11] <DaveMethvin> b/c i think it can
[08:57:31] <DaveMethvin> so have all the testers been on recent macbook pros?
[08:57:35] <ryanneufeld> yes
[08:57:39] <ryanneufeld> or linux afaik
[08:57:42] <DaveMethvin> genetic diversity, man
[08:59:26] <ryanneufeld> hey man, we had Linux AND Unix covered
[09:00:54] <DaveMethvin> except for the software side
[09:01:02] <DaveMethvin> sorry, HARDWARE side
[09:14:32] <DaveMethvin> okay, enabled in bios, got to this: https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/924f05499e891c0b0ac7
[09:14:58] <DaveMethvin> after 2 hours the yak is only half shaven, but i have to do some other things
[09:15:34] <DaveMethvin> vagrant.jquery.com lets me set up wp, seems like we need some more info here
[09:41:28] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:42:03] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: now that it's up, you can edit the config.json with the creds you used
[09:42:13] <ryanneufeld> and grunt deploy to vagrant.jquery.com
[09:45:20] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: DaveMethvin: i got same error on widnows 8.1
[09:45:36] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: you have to be sure to enable VT in the BIOS
[09:45:46] <ryanneufeld> I wonder...
[09:45:52] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: can you hangout?
[09:45:59] <arschmitz> yeah for a few minutes
[09:46:02] <ryanneufeld> ok
[09:55:50] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2656
[10:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: I think we can just move the WP_CONTENT_DIR defintion to config.php.
[10:46:36] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: to what end?
[10:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody shoud ever configure it.
[10:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> wp-sample-config is for things that the user might change.
[10:48:27] <ryanneufeld> ah
[10:48:36] <ryanneufeld> so then we should change the infra repo too?
[10:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we should try to keep the two in sync.
[10:49:38] <scott_gonzalez> The fact that infra doesn't follow the directory structure in the jquery-wp-content README is kinda annoying.
[10:50:59] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:51:02] <ryanneufeld> you're telling me
[10:51:13] <ryanneufeld> this whole thing would have been done a week earlier if that was the case :p
[10:51:30] <ryanneufeld> the uploads dir thing is what I spent much of my time working on
[13:39:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so like - in a generic setup on apache, the "forked approach" that we use to be able to replace wordpress/ OR jquery-wp-content/ entirely is a pretty complicated apache (or even nginx) vhost config, i think we went with "put it inside of wordpress" on the "locla" setup instructions because it was easier 
[18:41:08] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf, scott_gonzalez
[18:41:22] <ryanneufeld> are you guys around tonight to chat about pull 292?
