[07:59:49] <gnarf> s5fs: if you want to look into it, and a puppet setup to install/configure - send me a pull please :)
[17:00:47] <s5fs> gnarf: installing is easy, do you wanna customize the config as well? if so, there are some existing modules in the forge that may work. also, which hosts should we hit, all of them?
[17:01:03] <s5fs> gnarf: also, any movement on the ssl certs? just checkin' in :)
