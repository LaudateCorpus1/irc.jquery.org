[05:43:49] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: we want actually /var/www/wordpress/uploads
[05:44:09] <gnarf> if we define( 'UPLOADS', 'uploads' ); in the wp-config.php it should do this
[05:46:07] <gnarf> assuming i read the code for that function scott linked up right
[05:46:15] <gnarf> php gets harder to read every month

[08:16:51] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: the folder you're using now is /var/www/wordpress/wordpress/uploads
[08:16:56] <gnarf> get rid of the second jump
[08:17:15] <gnarf> also
[08:17:27] <gnarf> i think it pulls the abs path in the wp_upload_dir function
[08:18:19] <gnarf> https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.8/src/wp-includes/functions.php#L1586 -- you don't need to define that

[16:43:11] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: have you worked with a beagle bone at all?
[16:44:52] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: yeah, the black is what i'm using at work
[16:45:07] <ryanneufeld> yeah? how does it compare to an rpi?
[16:45:19] <s5fs> better imho
[16:45:25] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[16:45:32] <ryanneufeld> I see it has a lot of IO
[16:45:37] <s5fs> you have 2gigs of emmc onboard, so you dont' have to run the os off of a thumbdrive
[16:45:40] <s5fs> you have way more gpio pins
[16:45:49] <s5fs> and it's a faster processor
[16:46:01] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[16:46:05] <ryanneufeld> cost wise?
[16:47:00] <s5fs> $35 for a for an rpi, $45 for a beaglebone black
[16:47:13] <ryanneufeld> yeah, not bad
[16:47:24] <s5fs> i'm not using the rpi anymore, mostly just beagles
[16:47:33] <ryanneufeld> DD3 ram...
