[00:24:43] <Krinkle> gnarf: Next Thursday, jenkins stuff? Preferably some time in the hours before 18:00 UTC
[06:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What just happened with stage.api.jqueryui.com deploy?
[06:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> error: Ref refs/heads/master is at a7a55847fe0c3d675c9ca9c95169508e42bf1e87 but expected 8cff9b63c648b462c94c6a4f07bdc14f46c410d4
[06:44:13] <scott_gonzalez>  ! 8cff9b6..a7a5584  master     -> master  (unable to update local ref)
[06:45:54] <gnarf> um
[06:46:06] <gnarf> no clue
[06:46:14] <gnarf> might need to be cleaned up / reset by hand
[06:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> The next deploy worked fine.
[06:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> I just have no idea how that error even happens.
[06:47:25] <gnarf> 2 at once?
[06:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> There was time in between.
[06:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: BTW, I used `git pr` for that commit.
[06:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> Very nice :-)
[06:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> Now you need to write a `pr-clean` command which deletes all the pr/* branches.
[06:58:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: um
[07:03:15] <gnarf> what would you use to get the lis
[07:03:17] <gnarf> list?
[07:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> git branch
[07:05:10] <scott_gonzalez> Or ls .git/refs/heads/pr ?
[07:05:48] <gnarf> git for-each-ref refs/heads/pr/*
[07:05:56] <gnarf> what about removing the ref, branch -D ?
[07:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:10:43] <gnarf> git for-each-ref refs/heads/pr/* --format="%(refname)" | while read ref ; do branch=${ref#refs/heads/} ; git branch -D $branch  ; done
[07:10:46] <gnarf> ?
[07:11:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^ any revisions?
[07:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[09:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you ever talk to clarkbox about https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org ?
[09:39:43] <gnarf> no, but orphan it
[09:39:50] <gnarf> we can move it to clark later
[09:39:52] <gnarf> if he wants it
[09:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
