[05:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yay. At least something I've done in the past two weeks is now visible.
[08:27:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :)
[09:46:31] <danheberden> wow gnarf 
[09:46:45] <danheberden> 'tis awesome
[09:47:04] <gnarf> danheberden: lot nicer to work with too - new releases now you just add the files to the repo and push it
[09:47:17] <danheberden> that sounds like too much work
[09:47:19] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4BOZcDMw_A
[09:48:08] <danheberden> i wish i had a spice weasel 
[09:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think I really need to review v3 support for node-browserstack...
[09:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-browserstack/pulls
[09:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if that list means I'm a success or a failure.
[09:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> Probably both.
[09:59:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: success you made some one say gobsmacked thats always a success
[10:03:39] <gnarf> heh
[10:03:48] <gnarf> only 4 implementations of v3? :)
[10:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> Heh. arschmitz: Do any of the sites that "rank" OSS contributions have a gobsmacked badge? That'd be awesome.
[10:06:06] <arschmitz> sadly not that im aware of 
[10:06:17] <arschmitz> i think the community as a whole needs one though
[10:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see my comments that he was referring to?
[10:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-browserstack/pull/14
[10:06:50] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #14 by mattheworiordan (4mon 1w ago): API version 3 support, including the additional status methods and appropriate documentation
[10:07:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yes his PR was insane we was borderline trying to steal it from you
[10:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> "a working commit barring a few cosmetic changes."
[10:08:05] <arschmitz> lol 
[10:08:44] <arschmitz> i think more of the changes in the PR were problems then fixes
[10:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> And he broke one of the methods.
[10:10:47] <arschmitz> lol yeah "I welcome contributors to my open source projects and help them, instead of criticising." does that mean in this case we welcomes people to steal crdit and break his projects?
[10:11:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: if so remind me to keep a good distance from any of his projects lol
[10:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[11:21:56] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: holy shit...
[11:22:04] <ryanneufeld> that's ballsy
