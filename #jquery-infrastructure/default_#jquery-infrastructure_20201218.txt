[03:34:13] <SCL> hello, we are having problems with the use of "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0.min.js" (ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS) from some ip range, for example 201.239.250.X but from others isp works great, maybe some cdn trouble?
[10:40:48] <kwargs> Hello, is there anyone here?
[10:42:17] <kwargs> I would like to report a redirect issue on the CDN
[10:45:16] <kwargs> It seems that this site has been abandoned for a while
