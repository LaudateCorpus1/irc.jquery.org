[11:02:28] <ryanneufeld> .
[11:05:03] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: What's this server doing? http://www-04.jquery.net/
[11:05:38] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: thats bugs
[11:05:40] <ryanneufeld> My ssh keys aren't on that box
[11:05:49] <gnarf> you can search for it on https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/DNS-AXFR
[11:06:16] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:06:18] <ryanneufeld> cool
[11:06:31] <ryanneufeld> exim is panicing
[11:06:45] <ryanneufeld> cause it
[11:06:50] <ryanneufeld> is running out of ram
[11:07:01] <ryanneufeld> That's trac isn't it?
[11:07:25] <ryanneufeld> and rkhunter is reporting "Please inspect this machine, because it may be infected.
[11:08:36] <gnarf> yeah
[11:08:47] <gnarf> the annoying nightly email
[11:08:48] <gnarf> :)
[11:08:58] <ryanneufeld> I have all day to work on stuff
[11:09:05] <ryanneufeld> thought I'd tackle some if this cruft
[11:09:08] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: added you an account
[11:09:21] <ryanneufeld> I can has sudo plz
[11:09:43] <gnarf> added to sudo gorup
[11:10:03] <ryanneufeld> thx
[11:10:19] <ryanneufeld> did my password get set as well?
[11:10:29] <gnarf> PM'ed you a password
[11:10:34] <gnarf> its not a puppeted machine
[11:10:44] <gnarf> we really need to finish moving bugs onto a new server
[11:10:51] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, we do
[11:11:09] <ryanneufeld> let's get some of the problems dealt with that we can for now?
[11:35:38] <ryanneufeld> is there anything using java on that box?
[11:37:12] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: you tell me
[11:37:18] <gnarf> i'm not aware of anything
[11:37:23] <gnarf> python for trac
[11:37:26] <gnarf> nginc
[11:37:29] <gnarf> mysql
[11:37:35] <gnarf> those are the important ones afaik
[11:37:45] <ryanneufeld> k, I deleted the /etc/.java dir
[11:37:49] <ryanneufeld> if it comes back
[11:37:52] <ryanneufeld> we'll know :p
[11:38:25] <gnarf> k
[11:38:33] <gnarf> you tar it first?
[11:38:45] <ryanneufeld> nah, was just lock files
[11:38:50] <ryanneufeld> I googled em first
[11:38:54] <ryanneufeld> there was no data in them
[11:39:03] <gnarf> k
[11:45:33] <ryanneufeld> So with proxy-01.stage.jquery.net
[11:45:41] <ryanneufeld> looks like it's just a staging for events
[11:45:54] <gnarf> probably not used
[11:45:56] <ryanneufeld> should I manually apt-get update the packages?
[11:46:05] <ryanneufeld> or should we just take that box down?
[11:46:41] <gnarf> we should probably shut it down - need to double check with a few people first - make an issue with any discovery you've done on the box - what it has, etc
[11:47:10] <ryanneufeld> okay
[11:47:17] <ryanneufeld> is that one puppetized?
[11:47:21] <gnarf> also, I know there are some of those machines that are down / dns that is bad
[11:47:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: no, its not in puppet
[11:47:56] <ryanneufeld> k, can you make me an account?
[11:48:07] <ryanneufeld> use the same password as before, i'll change it once i'm in
[11:49:03] <gnarf> doesn't wanna let me in either
[11:49:06] <gnarf> danheberden: you have access?
[13:21:22] <danheberden> proxy is root@
[13:21:24] <danheberden> and yeah, you have access gnarf
[13:21:39] <danheberden> (sry, was on a plane all day)
[13:21:42] <gnarf> hrm
[13:21:52] <gnarf> proxy-01.stage ?
[13:22:10] <gnarf> asks me for a password
[13:25:32] <gnarf> i tried root / gnarf / jqadmin
[13:25:43] <gnarf> all 3 give me a password attempt
[13:25:47] <gnarf> maybe its my old key?
