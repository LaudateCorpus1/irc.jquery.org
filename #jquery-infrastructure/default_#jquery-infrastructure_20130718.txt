[06:16:08] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #73 by scottgonzalez (5mon 4w ago): All name matching should be case-insensitive
[06:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf said yesterday that we should presrve case, and I mentioned that I think we're currently letting the URL change on every release.
[06:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> Which seems fine to me, and gnarf didn't comment after that, so I assume it was ok with him.
[06:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[06:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> BitBucket has case-insensitive user names, but not repo names for their URLs.
[06:25:58] <rworth> that's crazy talk
[06:26:24] <rworth> I'd be ok with us not supporting that level of insanity
[06:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> I was checking because I wanted to know if I could store the names in lowercase in our Repo instances.
[06:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> So the answer is apparently no. Thanks BitBucket :-/
[06:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I'll need to go through all the code and do case insensitive checks everywhere, instead of just sanitizing to lowercase at the beginning.
[06:30:24] <arschmitz> yuck
[06:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> If only I had addressed this issue 6 months ago when I filed it...
[06:32:37] <scott_gonzalez> Then I wouldn't need to clean up this mess of someone effectively having their plugin name stolen :-/
[08:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If I change the table definition, should I just run manually alter the table in production?
[08:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> Or should I script it, add it to the repo, deploy, then manually run the script in production.
[09:28:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: um - if you manually do it don't forget stage
[09:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm scripting it. Turns out sqlite3 has super limited ALTER TABLE support.
[09:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> You can only add columns or rename the table.
[09:29:42] <scott_gonzalez> I can't just change the collation of a single column.
[09:29:48] <gnarf> interesting
[09:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> I need to create a temp table, copy the data over, drop the table, create the new table, then copy the data back from the temp table.
[09:30:12] <gnarf> you need to rename it, create new and INSERT INTO ... SELECT FROM ?
[09:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> Renaming and inserting would probably work too.
[09:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> Their docs specifically mention using a temp table.
