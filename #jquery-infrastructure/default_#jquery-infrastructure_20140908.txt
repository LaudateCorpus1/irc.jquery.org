[09:50:13] <jzaefferer> gnarf: what do you use when you're on a pr/xxx branch and want to pull changes to that branch? Running "git pr xxx" again doesn't seem to work reliably
[09:50:50] <gnarf> jzaefferer: assuming you don't care about local changes
[09:50:51] <gnarf> git checkout head; git pr xxx
[09:51:13] <gnarf> or even git checkout master; git pr xxx
[09:51:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer also, have you seen the most recent update to the gist on that?
[09:51:34] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf/5406589
[09:52:24] <gnarf> jzaefferer: local changes will need to be picked back on top out of the reflog or something
[09:56:18] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I wasn't aware of the gist (weeeee no comment notifications), but I got your update aliases
[09:56:44] <jzaefferer> I can probably just add "git checkout master" in front to avoid doing that manually
[09:57:23] <jzaefferer> let's see how that works out
[09:58:00] <jzaefferer> gnarf: was also interesting that you added "ff" independently of my version, which does exactly the same
[09:58:14] <gnarf> jzaefferer: :)
[09:58:26] <gnarf> i love that alias
[10:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> Just double checking, did anyone need me to do anything before Chicago?
[10:07:46] <ryanneufeld> is pr a built in? or is that a alias you guys have?
[10:08:24] <ryanneufeld> nvm, read the link...
[11:38:33] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: I do not, no.
[11:53:08] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: nothing from me
