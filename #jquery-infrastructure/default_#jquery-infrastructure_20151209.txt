[10:22:55] <vladikoff> s5fs, gnarf, any ideas of what happened to the bot?
[12:05:10] <scott_gonzalez> That poor bot.
[12:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> It was left out in the rain.
[12:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> And it started to rust.
[12:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> And then it just fell apart.
[12:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> vladikoff: Honestly, I don't know, but we don't manage the bot.
[12:06:45] <arschmitz> Maybe we need to start hosting our own but 
[12:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> s/but/bot/ or s/but/butt/?
[12:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> ;-)
[12:07:34] <arschmitz> lol
[12:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Also, b-ot started doing s// replacements before it disappeared.
[12:07:51] <arschmitz> with out bot we cant even get corrections
[12:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> so sad
[12:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually quite annoying starting meetings without b-ot.
[12:09:06] <arschmitz> bot's are so unreliable how do they expect to rise up and crush human kind if they cant even stay connected to an irc channel 
[14:06:50] <vladikoff> arschmitz, scott_gonzalez,  - gnarf added the new b-ot to the deploy script
[14:08:20] <vladikoff> can't find the commit at the moment
