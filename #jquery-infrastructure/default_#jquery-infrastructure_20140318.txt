[07:55:14] <m_gol> ryanneufeld gnarf s5fs Krinkle|detached: ajax tests are failing again... http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2704. It's happening extremely often recently; it seems there's a new problem in our infrastructure
[07:56:34] <m_gol> it looks kind of like an unstable connection between our code & infra but there are often periods where it happens all the time and there's time where there's no problem
[08:08:48] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf
[08:10:24] <gnarf> so
[08:10:32] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15mzgol opened issue #255: IRC notifications don't fire 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/255
[08:10:41] <gnarf> my gut reaction is: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP USING sleep(10000) IN THE PHP
[08:11:35] <gnarf> m_gol ^ / ryanneufeld - look at the slow php log
[08:12:12] <m_gol> gnarf: ok, what can I use instead?
[08:12:40] <ryanneufeld> what
[08:12:47] <ryanneufeld> why are you using sleep 10000 ?
[08:13:06] <ryanneufeld> are you attempting to force a timeout?
[08:13:14] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yup ;)
[08:13:24] <ryanneufeld> then that would be a good way to do it
[08:13:25] <gnarf> m_gol: i dunno -- we can look at a solution that uses http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpEchoModule#echo_sleep maybe?
[08:13:39] <gnarf> basically - i think it's overloading the php fpm pool
[08:13:44] <gnarf> too many "sleeping" php processes
[08:13:52] <gnarf> there are only like 50-100 procs available for the pool
[08:14:01] <ryanneufeld> ahhhh I see
[08:14:05] <gnarf> but
[08:14:11] <gnarf> something else could be messing it up
[08:14:13] <ryanneufeld> so the nginx config would be a non-blocking version
[08:14:22] <gnarf> also the builds. uses its own pool
[08:14:31] <ryanneufeld> I feel like that would be a good thing to do then
[08:14:37] <gnarf> so its definitely something in the php code inside one of the repos being tested that is "locking" php-fpm processes
[08:14:42] <m_gol> this is the commit that introduced this file: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/32b066d3805a48f8c8312562ed52a1b5910b1d85
[08:14:58] <m_gol> and an associated PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1209
[08:15:38] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: yeah, that looks like that would do it
[08:15:40] <m_gol> but the idea is to have an iframe in a loading state for as long as a jQuery copy downloads, parses & starts executing ready code
[08:16:16] <m_gol> here's the code: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/data/core/dynamic_ready.html
[08:16:28] <m_gol> the dont_return.php is the file with the long sleep value
[08:16:42] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: the iframe would be async though
[08:17:23] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: I'm not sure what you mean :)
[08:17:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure what you mean either
[08:17:44] <ryanneufeld> like, what is this testing?
[08:19:07] <ryanneufeld> refresh my memory m_gol, what does a settimeout with no delay do?
[08:19:37] <m_gol> the test is to check that the ready event correctly fires in a jQuery copy if it's loaded after DOMContentLoaded but before load; that's what this iframe is for, to be before the load event
[08:19:38] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: "nextTick"
[08:19:41] <m_gol> timeout 0 is default
[08:19:57] <m_gol> and everything is clamped to 4ms anyway
[08:20:09] <m_gol> from the bottom
[08:20:20] <ryanneufeld> how is that different than (function(){})() ?
[08:20:28] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: not in the same event loop
[08:20:29] <m_gol> it's async
[08:20:34] <gnarf> aka "next tick"
[08:20:44] <ryanneufeld> interesting, I couldn't find docs on that
[08:21:36] <ryanneufeld> okay, so what is this test supposed to do? (I'm not very familiar with our test suite)
[08:24:48] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: I've already written ;)
[08:24:57] <m_gol> "the test is to check that the ready event correctly fires in a jQuery copy if it's loaded after DOMContentLoaded but before load; that's what this iframe is for, to be before the load event"
[08:25:23] <ryanneufeld> I see
[08:25:36] <ryanneufeld> I'm not proud to admit this, but I think this is beyond me
[08:29:31] <m_gol> anyway, the main problem here is that we need sth stopping the page from loading completely for some time
[08:29:39] <m_gol> that's what sleep(sth large) is for
[08:30:35] <m_gol> and apparently this creates an infra problem and starves the PHP process pool or sth
[08:30:40] <m_gol> any ideas, gnarf?
[08:30:55] <ryanneufeld> the nginx config he suggested would be a good start
[08:31:03] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: we could get that out to stage and test it?
[08:31:23] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: on another note, is it possible to get ZNC to listen on 443/
[08:31:24] <ryanneufeld> ?
[08:31:34] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: as well - i don't think so
[08:31:38] <gnarf> feel free to research
[08:31:42] <gnarf> but i think it only listens on one port
[08:31:49] <gnarf> if we can get it to listen to 2 i'd be happy to do it
[08:32:06] <ryanneufeld> the online config allows you to add more ports
[08:32:13] <ryanneufeld> but I can't add 443 
[08:32:17] <ryanneufeld> cause it's <1024
[08:32:44] <ryanneufeld> I just added 6667 as ssl just to test
[08:35:29] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: which machine is serving the php file?
[08:35:44] <m_gol> created an issue: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/256
[08:35:53] <m_gol> jenkins, I guess?
[08:35:56] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15mzgol opened issue #256: Figure out how to do sleep(sth large) on the server and not starve the PHP process pool 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/256
[08:37:14] <m_gol> yup
[08:37:14] <m_gol> http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/jquery/be565d1cdbdcb66e42411a2d7aa7e89b1fd66c1f/test/data/core/dont_return.php
[08:37:29] <m_gol> ryanneufeld ^^^
[08:37:38] <ryanneufeld> ok
[08:37:47] <ryanneufeld> lemme try setting up an endpoint for this
[08:37:57] <ryanneufeld> we won't need the php file if this works
[08:38:06] <ryanneufeld> I may have to bounce soon too
[08:38:08] <m_gol> would be great, thanks :)
[08:38:11] <ryanneufeld> first day at new job
[08:38:14] <m_gol> sure
[08:38:31] <ryanneufeld> oh... it's a new module
[08:38:34] <ryanneufeld> shoot
[08:38:38] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you're up buddy
[08:39:35] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: how to clean the PHP process pool?
[08:39:43] <ryanneufeld> restart frpm
[08:40:29] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: I don't see a process named like that
[08:40:33] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: restarted it for you
[08:40:37] <m_gol> k, thx
[08:40:46] <ryanneufeld> sudo /etc/init.d/php5-fpm restart
[08:42:47] <m_gol> thx
[08:43:01] <m_gol> crap, I was used to setTimeout accepting time in ms
[08:43:09] <m_gol> and kind-of assumed it's the same for PHP
[08:43:24] <m_gol> I wanted to put 100s there, not 100 000s
[08:43:40] <m_gol> that explains sth
[08:43:54] <m_gol> no one complained during code review ;)
[09:03:57] <m_gol> ryanneufeld gnarf: we don't actually need to sleep, we just need to have an endpoint that initializes the connection and never sends the response so that the browser thinks it's waiting for data
[09:22:37] <gnarf> m_gol: thats basically "blocking" in php though
[09:23:01] <gnarf> m_gol: short of developing our own node server to use for unit tests(which I'm still a fan of)
[09:23:11] <gnarf> i don't see  solution
[09:23:36] <gnarf> and/or just testing "mock ajax" results
[09:23:50] <gnarf> but i think most of the team is against using a mocking ajax lib for ajax tests in jQuery
[09:23:59] <gnarf> after all, we don't want to test the mock, we want to test the real thing
[11:30:37] <m_gol> gnarf: maybe it'll be better now that I've changed the script to sleep for 100 seconds instead of 100 000 :P
[11:30:59] <m_gol> 30h, lol
[11:34:45] <ryanneufeld> hahahah
[11:34:45] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:34:47] <ryanneufeld> that'll do it
[11:34:56] <ryanneufeld> sleep(5); should be enough
[11:35:03] <ryanneufeld> you're using 3s for your other settimeout
[11:35:10] <ryanneufeld> but sleep(10) shouldn't be a burden
[11:35:16] <ryanneufeld> how often does it run?
[13:42:15] <gnarf> once per browser per commit i think
[14:08:07] <s5fs> gnarf: okay to push that redirect for brand straight to master?
[14:35:31] <gnarf> s5fs: yeah
[14:35:52] <gnarf> s5fs: though - push directly to both would be more appropriate

[15:04:11] <gnarf> would be nice to see the impact of the change today regarding that sleep

[15:11:40] <m_gol> now they should be dying after 100s, not 30h, should help ;)
[15:13:12] <gnarf> m_gol: yeah - wish i had history on that graph
[15:28:56] <s5fs> gnarf: haha, for sure
