[14:08:31] <clarkbox> gnarf, any word from ubisoft on those 404's? i see they are still going strong
[14:09:02] <clarkbox> also, i have removed the access_log whitelist. we are now indexing all hosts.
[14:21:39] <clarkbox> gnarf, on helix, does the firewall panel let us do any more than just port block? can we set IPs to block?
[14:27:33] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: I'll take a look
[14:28:05] <ryanneufeld> if I can find the firewall config...
[14:29:11] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: I may not have access to that..
[14:29:31] <clarkbox> i know we can at least control the ports we allow
[14:29:45] <ryanneufeld> any idea where I'd find that?
[14:30:27] <ryanneufeld> I don't have access to all the machines it seems
[14:30:52] <clarkbox> no i don't have access to that stuff
[14:31:00] <clarkbox> not a big deal, just curious
[14:31:19] <ryanneufeld> if we're just doing iptables for the firewall
[14:31:26] <ryanneufeld> then we can do whatever
[14:32:13] <clarkbox> if we could block 4 or 5 IP's, we would cut down our total web traffic by about 10%
[14:32:25] <clarkbox> would be nice to cut it out upstream
[14:33:07] <clarkbox> well, i don't mean total trafficâ€¦ but more accurately, total hits
[14:33:18] <clarkbox> actual traffic could be more or less
[14:34:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:35:21] <ryanneufeld> what benefit would there be to blocking those IPS?
[14:35:50] <clarkbox> bah, not much. i am just obsessing over the logs
[14:36:03] <ryanneufeld> ha
[18:01:42] <gnarf> clarkbox: nope, just open/close ports I think I'll double check
[20:31:11] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: we can use iptables on each machine though can't we?
[20:42:13] <mikesherov> gnarf: mergeatron is having trouble accessing jenkins again. Did you guys make any changes recently?
[20:42:34] <mikesherov> gnarf: last build was 6 days ago http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/Mergeatron%20jQuery/lastBuild/
