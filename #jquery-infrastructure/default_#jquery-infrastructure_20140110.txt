[06:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's GitHub's API being silly.
[06:15:00] <scott_gonzalez>  /users/jquery/repos only lists public repos, even if you're authorized.
[06:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can only see private repos for orgs or yourself.
[06:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> So I need to change how we lookup the repos.
[06:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's fixed now.
