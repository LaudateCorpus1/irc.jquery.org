[07:30:37] <jzaefferer> Ping gnarf s5fs
[09:56:44] <gnarf> jzaefferer: looks proper to me
[09:59:15] <gnarf> jzaefferer: for some reason the nginx service wasn't restarting properly
[09:59:27] <gnarf> jzaefferer: manual stop/start worked and redirect is properly in place
[09:59:52] <gnarf> service nginx stop ; service nginx start -- worked
[09:59:56] <gnarf> service nginx restart -- failed
[10:00:17] <gnarf> but after the stop/start, restart is working again
[10:00:27] <gnarf> so i anticipate no problems pushing that to master when you're ready
[10:10:07] <jzaefferer> gnarf: huh, okay. Will deploy live after this meeting
[10:10:12] <jzaefferer> Thanks for checking!
[10:10:35] <jzaefferer> Nice to know I didn't do anything wrong, slightly disturbing that "did you try turning it off an on again" fixed it
[10:11:17] <gnarf> jzaefferer: welcome to dev ops :)
[10:11:50] <gnarf> were there any errors when you were running puppet agent --test ?
[10:12:00] <gnarf> i would have thought that it would have had an error code on the service nginx restart
[10:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> Top components on the bottom of https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/jquery_ui_download_builder isn't showing any data.
[10:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone know how to fix this?
[11:47:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I didn't see anything, but might've just missed it
