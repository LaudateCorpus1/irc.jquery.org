[11:18:30] <rxaviers_> gnarf, ryanneufeld, hello guys! How do I get znc to log my user out?
[11:18:48] <ryanneufeld> rxaviers_: that's great question...
[11:18:51] <gnarf> rxaviers_: do you not want to use it?
[11:18:58] <rxaviers_> :)
[11:19:12] <gnarf> rxaviers_: why not just connect to it instead of freenode? :)
[11:19:16] <rxaviers_> Nope.. I just figure out my log will get messy
[11:19:35] <rxaviers_> I log my convos offline
[11:19:53] <ryanneufeld> you can set ZNC to use a 0 history
[11:19:56] <ryanneufeld> or no playback
[11:19:58] <rxaviers_> and I usually use it to fetch previous conversations I had
[11:20:04] <gnarf> rxaviers_: you can turn off the buffer - connect to znc, etc
[11:20:21] <gnarf> rxaviers_: but like - the buffer does that for you, you can also remove timestamps, etc
[11:20:22] <rxaviers_> but, that's the poing.. using znc now will split my (local) log history
[11:20:39] <rxaviers_> I wanna revert with plain and simply logging to Freenode directly :(
[11:20:45] <rxaviers_> simple*
[11:20:56] <ryanneufeld> oh
[11:20:56] <gnarf> won't the znc buffer just save to the (local) log?
[11:21:07] <gnarf> we can just delete your used
[11:21:31] <rxaviers_> sorry for the trouble. Please, can you?
[11:21:51] <gnarf> I mean, my local logs still work just fine - and they even have the buffer to be able to find something that happened while I wasn't online :)
[11:21:55] <ryanneufeld> gnarf:  you got this?
[11:22:18] <gnarf> rxaviers_: ryanneufeld: yup
[11:22:20] <gnarf> done
[11:22:27] <kswedberg_> gnarf: is there a reason that the awaynick ZNC module isn't loaded? seems like it would be nice to have so people could tell if we're away.
[11:22:33] <rxaviers_> gnarf, I know. It's really a local thing
[11:23:28] <gnarf> kswedberg_: i'll see if I can install it
[11:24:04] <kswedberg_> cool! Also, do you know why I'm showing as "kswedberg_" and how I can remove that underscore? (sorry for the newb question)
[11:24:57] <gnarf> kswedberg_: /nick kswedberg
[11:25:14] <kswedberg> heh. thx!
[11:25:36] <gnarf> kswedberg: personally, i don't like the nick changing stuff
[11:25:46] <gnarf> because if someone connects/disconnects a lot it fills up the log
[11:26:38] <kswedberg> gnarf: oic. I guess it could get kind of busy.
[11:27:01] <gnarf> but - i'll turn it on ;)
[11:29:25] <kswedberg> :)
[14:07:38] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: also the nick changing stuff can get you banned from some channels cc kswedberg
[14:08:01] <ryanneufeld> like #httpd has an Op that will ban you for it.
[14:08:57] <ryanneufeld> kswedberg: also, there is an auto away mod, so when you log out of your IRC client it sets you away, with an auto responder
