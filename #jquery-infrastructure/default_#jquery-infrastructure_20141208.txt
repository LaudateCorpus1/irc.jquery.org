[12:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: Umm...what's up with that codeorigin deploy failure?
[12:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> What server is it trying to connect to that isn't running an up-to-date jquery-wp-content?
[13:01:57] <gnarf> Warning: Mismatching versions for Gilded WordPress. Version 1.0.0 is installed as a Node.js module, but the WordPress server is running version 1.2.1. Use --force to continue.
[13:01:58] <gnarf>  ?
[13:02:00] <gnarf> jq03
[13:02:04] <gnarf> or rather
[13:02:05] <gnarf> sorry
[13:02:06] <gnarf> wp03
[13:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...well wp03 is out of date for some reason.
[13:03:35] <gnarf> yeah, it wasn't listed in the hooks for wp-content for some reason
[13:03:43] <gnarf> fixed that
[13:04:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: fixed
[13:04:48] <gnarf> all fixed
[13:04:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok, can you kick off a manual update for that and a manual deploy for codeorigin?
[13:04:54] <gnarf> manually deployed
[13:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> Good to know it worked.
[13:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> Every site is now on Grunt 0.4.5 and grunt-jquery-content 2.0.0.
[13:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing left is updating the version barnches for api.jqueryui.com and api.jquerymobile.com.
[13:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> So that should be pretty easy.
