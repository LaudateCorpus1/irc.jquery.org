[08:54:01] <gnarf> m_gol: http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/history.php?action=showgraph&itemid=23742&sid=819b307e36f1ca6d is turning out to be kind of interesting
[08:54:14] <gnarf> s5fs: we could actually graph each pool for phpfpm in zabbix i think
[08:54:22] <gnarf> would have to do all of them manually
[08:54:25] <gnarf> but could be usef
[08:54:44] <gnarf> m_gol: seems we peaked out around 39 php processes, presumably during a jQuery test
[09:42:13] <gnarf> s5fs: ryanneufeld: whats your early eve look like tonight - hangout?
[13:43:27] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I'm still in the office
[13:43:28] <ryanneufeld> and my hotel wifi is balls
[13:44:11] <ryanneufeld> so I don't think I'll be able to hangout, I tried last night with my wife, but didn't work well
[17:33:11] <s5fs> gnarf: i'm available
