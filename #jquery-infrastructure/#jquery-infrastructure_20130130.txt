[06:38:51] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: got any time for jQuery today?
[06:39:00] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i'd like to finish off this backups script
[06:47:38] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I might be able to sneak some time in today
[06:48:23] <ryanneufeld> now that I have the node-notifier server working in production :)
[06:58:05] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: awesome, no change needed to my stuff?
[06:58:20] <ryanneufeld> not really no
[06:58:39] <ryanneufeld> had to modify scott_gonzalez's git-notifier to work w/ bitbucket
[06:58:42] <gnarf> lemme know after you submit a PR to scotts, i'll update my version in package.json
[06:58:52] <ryanneufeld> oh that's been subed
[06:59:05] <ryanneufeld> he hasn't has time to look at it yet
[06:59:12] <ryanneufeld> and bitbuckets json payload is lacking
[07:00:15] <gnarf> doesn't tell you about tags?
[07:00:22] <ryanneufeld> nothing about tags
[07:00:30] <gnarf> seems silly
[07:00:35] <gnarf> might wanna poke them about that
[07:00:40] <ryanneufeld> there is an open bug about it
[07:00:44] <gnarf> there might be some option you need to turn on
[07:00:46] <gnarf> or
[07:00:47] <gnarf> a bug
[07:00:48] <gnarf> :)
[07:01:46] <ryanneufeld> afk

[10:56:36] <ryanneufeld> hey gnarf, I'm seeing an odd problem with the notifier
[10:56:47] <ryanneufeld> it seems that it works once, then doesn't after that
[10:58:27] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: hate to say this, but define doesn't work 
[10:58:27] <gnarf> ;)
[10:58:55] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[10:59:00] <ryanneufeld> fair enough
[10:59:15] <gnarf> like, is it not spawning, not receiving an event, is the shell script breaking, have you tried logging out the events you're publishing from within scott's stuff?
[10:59:40] <ryanneufeld> yeah, gonna do that now
[10:59:53] <ryanneufeld> I dunno why I even msged you without checking dirst
[10:59:55] <ryanneufeld> *first
[11:00:00] <ryanneufeld> full of DERP today
[11:00:53] <ryanneufeld> npm <3
[11:01:59] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: shrug, my first 4 thoughts were obviously a bit further along the debugging process than yours, happy to share em ;)
[11:02:36] <ryanneufeld> oh
[11:02:44] <ryanneufeld> well, *that* explains everything
[11:02:50] <ryanneufeld> I didn't have the repo pointing at it
[11:02:56] <ryanneufeld> what I saw working was another repo
[11:03:00] <ryanneufeld> LFMF
[11:07:15] <ryanneufeld> yeah... that was it
[11:07:19] <ryanneufeld> works perfectly now
[11:23:03] <gnarf> heh
[12:55:34] <gnarf> clarkbox: any update on adding that "real_server" key to the splunk logging? to be able to say just get sourcetype="access_combined" real_server="jq01"
