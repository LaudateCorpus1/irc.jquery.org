[06:40:46] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: How does irc.jquery.org get the list of channels on the left nav? mikesherov needs to add #esprima to that, i can see where the page is edited but not the list
[06:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/irc.jquery.org/sidebar.php
[06:46:07] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so just adding it there will log? or are there changes needed elsewhere?
[06:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> You need to file an infrastructure ticket for the logging.
[06:46:57] <DaveMethvin> ok, just trying to get a list of items for onboarding so we wanted to document this as specifically as possible
[06:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> Also need to make sure the topic of the channel says that it's publicly logged.
[06:48:06] <DaveMethvin> do you have notes on what you did for PEP? we may be missing some stuff
[06:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> There's also some permissions that gnarf wants to set in new channels.
[06:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> I believe it was create the channel, register the channel, set the topic, edit jquery-wp-content, file infra ticket for logging.
[06:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> And then gnarf asked for permissions being set, but he did whatever needed to happen for that.
[06:53:47] <mikesherov> gnarf: yo!
[06:54:11] <mikesherov> jquery/esprima would like the 2PM wednesday slot to hold their meeting
[06:54:19] <mikesherov> but it seems to conflict with infra
[06:54:40] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: said you guys don't always use it so I'm wondering if you guys wouldn't mind finding a diff time?
[06:54:57] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: ^
[06:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: ^
[06:56:04] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I've been wondering why we use #jquery-meeting.
[06:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> It only seems to complicate matters.
[06:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know the history behind why it was created in the first place though.
[06:56:50] <gnarf> use it
[06:56:52] <gnarf> remove us
[06:56:54] <gnarf> mikesherov
[06:57:18] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: can you put the jqlog bot on for #esprima ?
[06:57:55] <gnarf> mikesherov: our meeting is a private call late thursday nowadays and more of a jam session
[06:59:06] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15dmethvin opened issue #318: Set up message bot for #esprima 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/318
[07:00:05] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: oh you mean vs using the individual channel? it predates me ... i dunno
[07:00:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so one thing that is nie
[07:00:49] <mikesherov> thanks gnarf scott_gonzalez 
[07:00:50] <gnarf> is you can get only the meeting
[07:00:51] <gnarf> in a log
[07:01:10] <mikesherov> right, I want a log channel that gets only meeting notes
[07:01:22] <mikesherov> because that's all the non-esprima team members care about
[07:01:29] <mikesherov> like, what did esprima decide this week
[07:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> That's what the public minutes are for.
[07:01:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: it's also what the irc log is for
[07:01:59] <DaveMethvin> and it's what the Google Doc is for
[07:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> You'd still get that though.
[07:02:02] <mikesherov> public minutes don't capture everything perfectly
[07:02:04] <DaveMethvin> TRIFECCTA
[07:02:08] <mikesherov> ANYWAY
[07:02:14] <mikesherov> We'd like to use #jquery-meeting
[07:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> You think there'd be a lot of non-meeting noise in the dev channel during the meeting?
[07:02:31] <mikesherov> not during it
[07:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> So then what's the problem?
[07:02:44] <mikesherov> the problem is nothing
[07:02:57] <mikesherov> we had no problem until you decided using two irc channels was a problem just now :-)
[07:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> Viewing the log of #jquery-meeting you still need to limit by time to find what you want anyway.
[07:03:00] <gnarf> re: permissions -- I'd like if me, ajpiano, and s5fs got +AFRefiorstv on chanserv
[07:03:41] <mikesherov> the esprima team thinks its valuable to hold a meeting in a different room
[07:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> So, I've seen the different channel cause confusiong for people. I've also seen meetings that go long get cut off just because there's another meeting immediately after.
[07:03:56] <mikesherov> That would mean create esprima-meeting
[07:04:11] <gnarf> mikesherov: seems fine
[07:04:20] <gnarf> mikesherov: if yall want it
[07:04:27] <gnarf> we can add it to logs too
[07:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to use #jquery-meeting. I just wanted to know why we're using it.
[07:05:01] <mikesherov> Well, I mean, I'm just trying to keep it simple, we just decided to use jquery-meeting. Would require me to annoyingly now suggest a different room
[07:05:10] <gnarf> thats fine too
[07:05:23] <mikesherov> the reason to use it is a central place to see all the meeting notes from everything the foundation is up to
[07:06:07] <mikesherov> It's just another onboarding step. But I suppose it's fine
[07:06:13] <mikesherov> let's do esprima-meeting
[07:06:47] <gnarf> mikesherov: whenever you know what channels we need to setup jqlog for can you create an infra ticket and ping @ryanneufeld ?
[07:07:01] <mikesherov> gnarf: I know now
[07:07:17] <mikesherov> just also need to know how op stuff works on esprima-meeting
[07:08:50] <mikesherov> gnarf ryanneufeld https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/318
[07:10:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you still have that irc hooks audit script that makes sure it's subscribed to the right events?
[07:11:43] <gnarf> mikesherov: did you want b-ot in those channels too?
[07:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/foundation/tree/master/scripts/irc-hooks
[07:12:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you run it, I can't your code doesn't support 2fa ;)
[07:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. I'll add 2fa at some point too.
[07:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> I should really add the ability to just manage a single repo.
[07:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> Every time I run this it takes forever because it walks each repo and there are lots of repos that don't need IRC logs and it prompts for each of them.
