[16:47:28] <Krinkle> gnarf: What's up?
[16:48:10] <gnarf> Krinkle: nothin, my last ping was days ago i think
[16:48:11] <gnarf> :)
[16:49:16] <Krinkle> gnarf: No, it was 2 hours ago
[16:49:19] <Krinkle> 2 hours ago, 2 days ago
[16:49:23] <Krinkle> you're right :)
[16:49:38] <Krinkle>  [2013-02-15 23:00:39 +01:00] 
[16:49:43] <gnarf> jq03 had some runaway something
[16:49:46] <gnarf> in jenkins
[16:49:52] <gnarf> was gonna see if you could look around in logs
[16:49:53] <Krinkle>  [2013-02-18 01:49:12 +01:00] 
[16:50:08] <gnarf> but its prolly not important
[16:50:15] <Krinkle> gnarf: Now that you're here though, I worry about jq03
[16:50:18] <gnarf> it hasn't come back after restart
[16:50:38] <Krinkle> I don't know why but it seems like something around the testswarm (not jenkins) seems to just fail everytime it gets a little load
[16:50:50] <Krinkle> sql gone, nginx timing out, php freaking out, whatever it is.
[16:51:05] <gnarf> it wasn't "little" load last time
[16:51:08] <gnarf> it was up in the 30s
[16:51:32] <Krinkle> I mean we're not dealing with people load
[16:51:41] <Krinkle> it's the load we invite to it through browserstack clients
[16:52:49] <Krinkle> gnarf: I'm currently making some final touches to the projects rewrite, that should make the db layout more sane and scalable
[16:53:03] <gnarf> cool
[16:53:30] <Krinkle> I'll probably also go for a db reset to avoid any migration issues. We're still within 1.0 cycle, I don't plan to write db migration scripts for within the 1.0 cycle (only from 0.2 to 1.0 and from 1.0 to 1.1)
[16:54:01] <Krinkle> cost of running on edge
