[04:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: It's still in use. I think the only thing that will work for the move is to do a WordPress export.
[04:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> The site cannot be rebuilt from an empty database. The script will die almost immediately.
[05:13:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we need to move the builder
[05:13:55] <gnarf> the part running on jq02
[05:14:19] <gnarf> if we move the repos/ and the sqlites can we stand it back up?
[05:14:37] <gnarf> or can we just let it die in "read only" mode
[05:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> I thought the builder portion didn't even run anymore.
[05:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> Since submissions are disabled.
[05:56:43] <gnarf> thats what i'm saying
[07:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there any specific logging you'd like to see from jquery-license?
[07:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we need to log too much. Maybe just when a request comes in, and the result?
[07:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> I can throw in a bunch of debug messages using the debug module though.
[08:21:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nothing super important IMO - also STDOUT gets thrown away in the node-init scripts i wrote
[08:21:55] <gnarf> need to fix that
[10:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: So it looks like we're probably ready to push jquery-license to production and enable on a repo to start testing?
[12:02:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: still need to decide how we want to give jquerybot write
[12:02:33] <gnarf> and its already enabled on jquery-license
[12:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but I doubt we'll be getting PRs on that repo.
[12:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> We should enable for a popular repo.
[12:13:03] <gnarf> name one, i'll add it
[12:13:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i can still crash the server on cla-01 by hitting it in chrome
[13:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Sorry, was on a call.
[13:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> What are you doing to cause the crash?
