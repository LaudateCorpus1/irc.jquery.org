[10:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden gnarf jdorfman: Do we have stats for which versions of core are being loaded from the CDN?
[10:07:09] <danheberden> i don't have access (i don't think?) to the maxCDN stuff
[10:21:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez yes we do
[10:21:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez danheberden i can add you to the account
[10:21:44] <gnarf> emails?
[10:22:01] <jzaefferer> gnarf: please add me, too
[10:22:24] <jzaefferer> joern.zaefferer@gmail.com 
[10:22:46] <danheberden> danheberden@gmail.com
[10:22:51] <danheberden> ONE EMAIL TO RULE THEM ALL
[10:22:53] <danheberden> hee hee
[10:23:07] <gnarf> invites sent
[10:23:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez https://gist.github.com/gnarf/3af2e42d02640378cbd4
[10:24:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez you seem to have already been invited?
[10:28:26] <danheberden> well that's the worst way to pick timezones i've ever seen in my life
[10:29:13] <danheberden> maxcdn - making you scroll through a 1000 item long select to find a proper city in the same timezone
[10:29:15] <danheberden> heh heh
[10:35:00] <jzaefferer> danheberden: you can type to filter. That works pretty well. Though the scrolling not so much
[10:35:11] <danheberden> i kept picking wrong cities
[10:35:12] <danheberden> heh
[10:35:19] <danheberden> san diego, portland, seattle
[10:35:26] <danheberden> totally forgot about AL
[10:35:27] <danheberden> *LA
[20:51:01] <s5fs> gnarf: orkel poked me about updating his username on bugs. I think we have to update the tables directly so i dug around and think I have all the sql ready. Do we have a dev or staging box for this or should I just be real careful in prod? I'll back the db up first of course haha!
[21:14:19] <s5fs> gnarf: here's a gist, let me know if i missed anything https://gist.github.com/aulvi/e49132f18cb432aebeb2
