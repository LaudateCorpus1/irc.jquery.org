[15:37:41] <m_gol> what should I do if I want to update browsers but puppet-stage is newer than puppet-master, anyone?
[16:02:38] <gnarf> m_gol do you know what the case is there?
[16:02:51] <m_gol> gnarf: hm?
[16:03:28] <gnarf> m_gol: just https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/compare/puppet-stage - looks safe to merge to master to me
[16:03:40] <gnarf> land it on stage and ff both your commit and s5fs' to master
[16:04:00] <m_gol> gnarf: ok, thanks!
