[09:55:52] <ryanneufeld> ?
[09:55:57] <ryanneufeld> about bugs?
[10:19:28] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: yeah - no idea what that is
[10:19:43] <ryanneufeld> it looks like a clone of jquery.git
[10:19:54] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you around?
[10:55:56] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: hey
[10:56:17] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: do you know why there is a clone of jquery.git on bugs?
[10:56:32] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: no idea
[11:10:28] <ryanneufeld> I don't know if you've responded mikesherov, but our internet connection died, and I have no backlog :S
[11:11:16] <mikesherov> no idea
