[04:24:40] <m_gol> gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld it seems jquery.com & jquery.org are down, this time for real (tested both on company WiFi & on a mobile network)
[04:53:05] <m_gol> also, I get an error at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381
[04:53:12] <m_gol> OperationalError: (1030, 'Got error 122 from storage engine')
[05:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it looks like the server is dead.
[05:26:22] <ajpiano> there is definitely something 
[05:26:26] <ajpiano> wrong
[05:26:27] <ajpiano> yup
[05:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> I can't SSH to jq01 and pinging times out on all packets.
[05:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> Just called Corey, he'll be on in a bit.
[05:33:04] <gnarf> calling mt now
[05:40:44] <jzaefferer> I can't reach http://jqueryui.com/ or jquery.com - scott_gonzalez gnarf anyone around?
[05:41:02] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Read the backlog...
[05:41:37] <jzaefferer> I just did, but "calling mt now" was the last message, apparently sent 9 hours ago, if the timestamp is correct
[05:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> More like 9 minutes ago.
[05:41:57] <jzaefferer> oh
[05:42:15] <jzaefferer> Guess I don't have the right timezone configured in ZNC
[05:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> Was that from a ZNC playback?
[05:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:43:02] <jzaefferer> Can't reach http://znc.jquery.com:6697/ either, though IRC itself still works, weird
[05:43:04] <kborchers> heh, i also just jumped in here to ping gnarf and here we are
[05:43:36] <jzaefferer> Hey Kris. How's the beer drinking going? Can't tell if you stopped drinking or disabled the Twitter integration ;)
[05:45:15] <jzaefferer> While we wait and hope for the best: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8_Kfjo3VjU
[05:46:13] <gnarf> this might be a big (mt) network outage

[05:46:36] <kborchers> jzaefferer: lol
[05:46:44] <kborchers> i only had those 3 :P
[05:47:03] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah that's not good :/
[05:47:39] <kborchers> of course mediatemple.net is up
[05:48:25] <gnarf> can you guys please run a traceroute to jq01.jquery.com and znc.jquery.com ?
[05:49:15] <gnarf> I can get to znc
[05:49:32] <gnarf> and znc is running
[05:49:46] <kborchers> i get to znc but not jq01
[05:49:46] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https on znc ?
[05:50:31] <gnarf> are we all on comcast?
[05:50:35] <jzaefferer> gnarf: that helps
[05:50:40] <jzaefferer> I'm sure I'm not on comcat
[05:50:54] <gnarf> wondering if we get gummed up in cogentco?
[05:51:00] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf/1565586462a2c80fceb5
[05:51:02] <kborchers> gnarf: i am on comcast

[05:57:05] <gnarf> m_gol thanks for the heads up - next time this big of an issue is going unanswered, if you can afford a phone call to the states please feel free to call me :)
[05:58:14] <gnarf> m_gol bugs is just out of disk space
[05:58:17] <gnarf> this i can fix soon
[05:58:30] <gnarf> while waiting on hold
[05:58:55] * gnarf jams out to "Go your own way" Fleetwood Mac on (mt) hold
[05:59:36] <jzaefferer> How about I tweet something on @jquery and RT that on other accounts? Or just wait for the sites to come back up?
[06:01:11] <kborchers> we should probably tweet something as there have been a few folks asking about it on twitter. i can do it too if you want
[06:02:13] <gnarf> apparently jq01 triggered a DDoS banning in their network layer
[06:02:23] <jzaefferer> kborchers: sure, go ahead
[06:02:25] <gnarf> Up within an hour
[06:02:32] <gnarf> I'll start building another jq01
[06:02:35] <gnarf> just in case
[06:03:00] <gnarf> fuck why does this have to be at this hour of the morning - i wish s5fs were around ;)
[06:05:06] <jzaefferer> Thanks gnarf for getting up so early and getting this fixed
[06:06:02] <kborchers> about to tweet "We are aware of an issue where some are unable to reach our websites. We are working with our host to resolve and will update status soon."
[06:25:41] <jzaefferer> Retweeted from @jqueryui and @qunitjs
[06:30:22] <gnarf> as DNS updates, things should start working
[06:43:03] <jzaefferer> back up for me
[06:46:50] <jzaefferer> gnarf: any idea what caused the ban?
[06:48:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: none - the techs couldn't answer me on the phone, but they submitted my request for more info to their manager
[06:49:28] <gnarf> also I pressured our tech contact at (mt) to follow up with us as well
[06:49:34] <kborchers> seems like everything but mobile is back up for me
[06:49:43] <kborchers> thanks for the hard work gnarf 
[06:50:01] <gnarf> but at this point its probably a "hurry up and wait" for an explanation 
[06:50:15] <gnarf> kborchers: yeah - its just DNS moved to a new IP
[06:50:29] <gnarf> should be <1hr from 50 minutes ago
[06:50:47] <gnarf> 30 minutes ago
[06:50:49] <gnarf> maybe 20
[06:50:54] <gnarf> when i actually flipped the bits
[06:51:03] <gnarf> most of the TTL's were set to 30 minutes or an hour
[06:51:08] <gnarf> we lowered them to 15 minutes
[06:54:02] <m_gol> gnarf: ok, I'll remember that :)
[07:03:10] <gnarf> shoutout to s5fs and ryanneufeld for waking up to my 911 hangouts message - thanks!
[07:16:05] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/Rapidenet_CA/status/466578643016486912 :(

[07:24:25] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15gnarf opened issue #268: Automate AXFR report 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/268
[07:24:27] <gnarf> s5fs: seem like a sane project: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/268 ?
[07:43:59] <gnarf> lol - i was just watching the intro infrastructure talk from portland - "scott_gonzalez doer of all things that gnarf doesn't also do" - ajpiano"
[07:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> I laughed about that on stage, didn't I?
[07:45:02] <gnarf> we both did
[07:45:08] <gnarf> then looked at each other trying to parse it
[07:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[07:46:32] <gnarf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t61RoAs7E8#t=18
[07:46:56] <gnarf> also you just like skipped me in the intro adam
[07:47:02] <gnarf> i got a mention in scotts intro
[07:47:11] <gnarf> I see how you feel, *turns a shoulder*
[08:13:25] <ryanneufeld> http://i.imgur.com/DSvfoEV.jpg
[08:15:33] <ryanneufeld> are there plans to do a similar talk at the Chicago conf?
[08:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Heh, I didn't realize he totally skipped over you.
[10:58:45] <gnarf> s5fs: ryanneufeld: http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/chart2.php?graphid=406&period=32400&stime=20140513231659&updateProfile=1&profileIdx=web.screens&profileIdx2=406&sid=aa8f6df354311822&width=1296&curtime=1400090223038
[11:05:05] <gnarf> we should try to dig into the logs around http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=aa8f6df354311822&form_refresh=1&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10055&graphid=406
[11:05:24] <gnarf> figure out what it was that caused 50MBps of outgoing traffic here
[11:05:37] <gnarf> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/chart2.php?graphid=406&period=3600&stime=20140514020956&updateProfile=1&profileIdx=web.screens&profileIdx2=406&sid=aa8f6df354311822&width=1296&curtime=1400090676678
[11:19:20] <gnarf> forgive the insane url - but i don't think it was HTTP traffic: http://tinyurl.com/n78sj3a
[11:19:51] <gnarf> scratch that
[11:19:55] <gnarf> the rest of the graph loaded
[11:20:00] <gnarf> it was http to jquery.com it seems
[11:24:59] <nacin> gnarf: things ok?
[11:25:29] <gnarf> nacin: probably a total spoof
[11:26:49] <gnarf> but
[11:27:02] <gnarf> around 6am eastern today
[11:27:30] <gnarf> our webserver got hit with millions of requests for jquery.com/ with WordPress as a user agent
[11:29:06] <gnarf> there are probably other things in here too
[11:29:14] <gnarf> but that is a serious bump of it
[11:30:06] <gnarf> 52k requests per minute starting around 6:09am eastern until it got shut down
[11:30:20] <gnarf> up from the ~1-2k requests
[11:30:49] <gnarf> nacin ^
[11:32:31] <gnarf> nacin: http://cl.ly/image/0m0w0B2G3r08 -- that is 350 megs in a 70 second window
[11:32:39] <gnarf> why it divided into 70 seconds, i dunno
[11:33:00] <nacin> we can just block those
[11:33:07] <nacin> it's basically an attempted DDOS
[11:33:10] <nacin> via pingbacks
[11:33:23] <nacin> did the server actually complain? or did nginx handle that fine?
[11:33:58] <gnarf> it handled it until (mt) blacklisted our IP
[11:34:15] <nacin> so you got blocked, or ?
[11:34:19] <gnarf> because it was so much traffic that it was taking down the whole cluster
[11:34:19] <nacin> as in, did the site go down?
[11:34:21] <gnarf> yeah
[11:34:22] <gnarf> for 3 hours
[11:34:23] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/3T1m240C1B35
[11:34:38] <nacin> hm. I will have to reach out to (mt) and smack them
[11:34:44] <nacin> they should have known better
[11:34:48] <gnarf> 400+ mbit/sec
[11:35:15] <gnarf> that second screenshot is EVERYTHING btw
[11:35:28] <gnarf> so like 99% of that spike is those WordPress 
[11:36:08] <gnarf> nacin: so what is this DDoS theory you have?
[11:36:51] <gnarf> oooo
[11:36:52] <gnarf> heh
[11:37:03] <gnarf> you added more info in 3.8 it seems
[11:37:04] <gnarf> 98.130.2.98 - - [14/May/2014:03:09:39 -0700]  "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 17430 "-" "WordPress/3.8.3; http://www.a-mother.com; verifying pingback from 64.191.75.101"
[11:37:08] <nacin> indeed
[11:37:13] <nacin> were they mostly 64.191.75.101?
[11:39:40] <gnarf> 173.198.233.78 also
[11:39:47] <gnarf> and other proxy ips
[11:40:27] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/3A3l462t2d2q

[11:44:40] <gnarf> nacin: so what can we do to protect against that particular ddos in the future?
[11:45:33] <gnarf> i actually think it's still happening
[11:46:11] <gnarf> nacin: ssh into jq01 and tail -f /var/log/nginx/jquery.com.access.log | grep WordPress
[11:46:20] <gnarf> about every 15 minutes there is a huge pulse of traffic
[11:46:46] <gnarf> scratch that

[11:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Speaking of pingbacks...
[11:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> I just landed this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/4dfcb3cdd30386e3e260fbe2dcfed883a919b13a
[11:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> But didn't deploy.
[11:47:46] <gnarf> her's the flood
[11:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> The timing is kinda funny.
[11:47:53] <gnarf> happening RIGHT NOW
[11:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> Anything else I should do beyond what I did in that commit?
[11:48:51] <gnarf> holy shit this is intense!
[11:51:58] <gnarf> ✓ root@jq01:gnarf# tail -60000 /var/log/nginx/jquery.com.access.log | grep WordPress | wc -l
[11:51:58] <gnarf> 48513
[11:52:20] <gnarf> thats between Wed May 14 11:51:53 PDT 2014 and 14/May/2014:11:45:45 -0700
[11:52:38] <gnarf> so in 6 minutes, 48,500 requests to http://jquery.com/
[11:52:50] <gnarf> nacin: how can I stop this?
[11:53:07] <gnarf> or like, how did you let pingbacks do this :)
[11:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> So ~135/second
[11:53:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: higher
[11:53:27] <gnarf> thousands in a second
[11:53:31] <gnarf> its quieter for periods
[11:54:01] <gnarf> but like 80% of the requests coming in right now are UserAgent WordPress....
[11:57:20] <gnarf> 50982 -- 111.68.211.131 - - [14/May/2014:11:52:36 -0700]  "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 17412 "-" "WordPress/3.3.2; http://japaninspection.org" cache:0,0 --- Wed May 14 11:56:57 PDT 2014
[11:57:32] <gnarf> 50,000 requests in 4 pinutes
[11:58:56] <ajpiano> i was about to come in here to say the same thing you said scott_gonzalez , that the timing was pretty weird of that commit
[11:59:36] <gnarf> nacin: I need to run AFK and get some lunch already --- 
[12:01:54] <gnarf> nacin: but i don't want to risk (mt) turning us off again
[12:01:57] <gnarf> ;)
[12:02:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: when did this commit land?
[12:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> yesterday, but it's not deployed
[12:03:56] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/0w1d2E3W2J2h
[12:03:59] <gnarf> hrm
[12:04:10] <gnarf> it started 6am (eastern)
[12:04:31] <gnarf> okay well, given that graph
[12:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> The commit was about 3pm ET.
[12:04:39] <gnarf> i'm not worried about being shut off
[12:04:44] <gnarf> again
[12:04:45] <gnarf> yet
[12:04:55] <gnarf> if it happens before I'm back from coffee - fuck it
[12:05:15] <gnarf> nacin: if you have ideas what started this / how to stop it - I'm all ears
[12:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> The commit just removes the exposure of pingbacks.
[12:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't stop someone from sending a pingback though.
[12:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming they know what URL/data to send.
[12:05:48] <nacin> it's not a pingback, has nothing to do with that
[12:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, earlier you said "attempted DDOS via pingbacks"
[12:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only reason I brought it up.
[12:06:54] <gnarf> pretty sure it was a successful DDoS via pingbacks btw :)
[12:07:08] <nacin> 400mbits a second is not a successful attack :-)
[12:07:12] <nacin> that's chump change, or should be
[12:07:43] <gnarf> nacin: thats only measured as bytes, not actual packet size
[12:08:02] <gnarf> nacin: it was enough that (mt) shut us off, which tells me it was getting close to maxing a gig
[12:08:11] <nacin> anyway
[12:08:22] <nacin> some other WP site got pinged, and was told that jquery.com/ had linked to it
[12:08:34] <nacin> so the site dutifully pulled up jquery.com/ and looked for the link
[12:08:46] <gnarf> * millions?
[12:08:55] <gnarf> * every 10 minutes ?
[12:08:55] <nacin> just block/limit requests from a ^WordPress/ user agent
[12:09:29] <gnarf> is there any reason to allow them?
[12:09:38] <nacin> nope
[12:10:02] <gnarf> is there any way to trigger the server to not ever request this url again?
[12:10:24] <gnarf> cuz it seems they are retrying or something
[12:12:05] <gnarf> its definitely trending upwards in traffic again
[12:29:01] <nacin> just block or otherwise limit requests from that user agent.
[12:58:08] <s5fs> nacin: good advice, we'll be putting that into place shortly
[12:58:33] <s5fs> nacin: is there a status code we can send back to WP that will prevent it from making subsequent requests to our domain?
[12:58:47] <nacin> negative
[12:58:56] <nacin> whole situation is pretty lame, but there is very little we can actually do
[12:59:39] <s5fs> nacin: agreed, just wanted to check before i added the rewrite
[13:00:46] <nacin> I would just throttle the hell out of that user agent
[13:00:48] <nacin> and then you'll be fine
[13:03:55] <s5fs> nacin: is that what you did on your hosts?
[13:04:23] <nacin> well, my hosts aren't getting attacked.
[13:04:54] <s5fs> i hope they never are!
[13:10:15] <gnarf> nacin: any reason not to just return a 403 Forbidden ?
[13:10:38] <nacin> from that user agent?
[13:10:41] <nacin> no, that's fine too
[13:11:34] <nacin> I was thinking using something like limit_req
[13:18:21] <gnarf> if ($http_user_agent ~ ^WordPress/) { return 403; }
[13:18:31] <gnarf> nacin: if we add that globally we won't break anything will we?
[13:18:34] <gnarf> :)

[14:00:00] <gnarf> ^ i suppose we need to allow that? :)
[14:00:54] <gnarf> cc nacin 
[14:01:04] <nacin> yes
[14:01:15] <gnarf> limited to /wp-cron 
[14:01:16] <gnarf> ?
[14:01:30] <gnarf> or will there be other "self inflicted"
[14:01:30] <nacin> hm
[14:01:35] <gnarf> or is there a way to change the UA ? :)
[14:01:41] <nacin> we can change the UA
[14:01:59] <gnarf> jquery-wp-content; WordPress/3.8; ....
[14:02:05] <gnarf> that would be enough to pass our filters
[14:02:15] <gnarf> if it's "prefixed" with anything
[14:02:22] <nacin> could you make it only filter based on GET versus POST for now?
[14:02:27] <gnarf> yes
[14:02:30] <gnarf> thats also pretty easy

[14:33:24] <gnarf> m_gol: btw: 
[14:33:29] <gnarf> m_gol: We have removed the block on this IP. Does this team member have a static IP, or a dynamic IP? I ask because we originally blocked this IP for suspicious email behavior, but it was on a completely separate (mt) Media Temple account. 
[14:33:33] <gnarf> ^^^ response from (mt)
[14:33:45] <gnarf> about your ip being blocked the other day
[14:33:56] <gnarf> apparently your ip propagated "suspicious email behavior"
