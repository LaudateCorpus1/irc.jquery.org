[04:54:23] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: wp-content?
[04:54:54] <gnarf> a bunch of us can take a pull into wp-content
[16:20:42] <ryanneufeld> s5fs, gnarf hangout tonight?
[16:22:45] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i'm not sure i'll be free. we're dealing with snow here and I have customers in town, so i'm working until they tell me i can go
[16:22:58] <s5fs> then its probably an hour to drive home, assuming no major roads are closed, bridges, etc.
[16:27:12] <ryanneufeld> okay
[16:27:15] <ryanneufeld> lemme know
[16:29:24] <s5fs> but otherwise i'm totally down for a hang
[17:35:29] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf scott_gonzalez kborchers where does the content on blog.jquery.com come from?
[20:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: blog.jquery.com doesn't use jquery-wp-content yet.
[20:54:14] <ryanneufeld> thanks scott_gonzalez, kris got back to me.
[20:54:23] <ryanneufeld> so those posts are done by logging in
[20:54:26] <ryanneufeld> which is cool
[20:54:39] <ryanneufeld> I just want to test every single repo
