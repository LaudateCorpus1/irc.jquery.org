[00:42:45] <Cork> appears like some cdn nodes are slow right now
[00:43:06] <Cork> two users in #jquery reports long load time
[00:43:18] <Cork> s5fs: ^
[00:43:33] <Cork> arschmitz: ^
[00:43:48] <Cork> (i can't reproduce my self)
[04:06:16] <arschmitz> Cork: ok thanks will check it out
[04:06:31] <Cork> just got a third
[04:07:01] <arschmitz> Cork: yeah i cant reproduce either
[04:07:42] <arschmitz> Cork: cdn or website the complaint i see in #jquery is about jquery.com not cdn
[04:08:15] <Cork> arschmitz: opps the old ones was about jqueryui.com
[04:08:27] <Cork> arschmitz: and isn't the content offloaded?
[04:08:30] <arschmitz> oh ok that makes a big difference 
[04:08:32] <Cork> (kinda assumed)
[04:08:48] <Cork> just noticed i didn't mention that ^^'
[04:08:56] <arschmitz> the cdn is completely seperate and we have been moving some sites around to so which site makes a difference around too :)
[04:09:50] <arschmitz> any other ones jqueryui.com and jquery.com both seem fine
[04:09:58] <arschmitz> but i am seeing issues at jquery.org
[04:10:18] <Cork> arschmitz: the original one was about jqueryui.com/datepicker
[04:10:34] <arschmitz> Cork: ok
[04:10:40] <Cork> and another user in the channel could confirm the long load time
[04:10:44] <Cork> i couldn't
[04:13:36] <arschmitz> yeah i cant on that but we do have an issue at least on jquery.org but that might be on our end we may have missed something when moving it
[04:14:25] <arschmitz> Cork: we were pretty much all hands on deck all weekend trying to keep the websites up and try to mitigate all he ddos
[04:14:48] <arschmitz> Cork: could you check jquery.org and lern.jquery.com ? want to confirm they are down for others also?
[04:14:57] <Cork> srue
[04:15:16] <Cork> loads fine here
[04:15:32] <arschmitz> both of them?
[04:16:08] <arschmitz> cork we have had some regional / isp specific issues too so just trying to figure out what it is this time
[04:17:13] <Cork> arschmitz: yes both works fine here
[04:18:36] <arschmitz> Cork: thanks
[04:18:40] <Cork> np
[04:20:45] <arschmitz> Cork: oh i bet i know duh still waking up someone in another channel said something that reminded me
[04:20:56] <arschmitz> we moved DNS and i think its still propagating 
[04:21:04] <Cork> ah
[04:21:07] <arschmitz> thats why its working for some
[04:21:13] <Cork> but would that result in long load time?
[04:21:25] <Cork> ah, they ended up on the ddosed servers?
[04:21:28] <arschmitz> and until it finishes a couple websites jqueryui.com specificly being one MAY point to wrong address
[04:22:38] <arschmitz> https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/jqueryui.com
[04:22:48] <arschmitz> Cork: the 142 addresses are wrong
[04:23:49] <Cork> oooh
[04:23:56] <Cork> that site is cool
[04:23:59] * Cork bookmarks
[04:25:45] <Cork> arschmitz: litropy reported that the site loaded, but was slow
[04:25:58] <arschmitz> Cork: ok
[04:28:11] <Cork> and Guest22601 was the original reporter
[04:28:33] <Cork> (had to dig through my logs a bit)
[04:36:11] <arschmitz> Cork cool thanks
