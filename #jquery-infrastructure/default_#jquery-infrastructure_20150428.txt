[09:06:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I've created #jquery-gsoc for Google Summer of Code mentors and students. Is there something I need to do to "register" that channel properly?
[09:06:45] <jzaefferer> I don't mind about logs
[12:01:28] <gnarf> jzaefferer: register it with chanserv, add me, s5fs, ajpiano as +* in the access list
