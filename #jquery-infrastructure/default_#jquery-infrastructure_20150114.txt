[12:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ryanneufeld: Actually, it looks like all logs stopped working yesterday.
[12:51:55] <scott_gonzalez> Probably when the script was moved to puppet?
[12:53:13] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #311: IRC logs don't work 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/311
[13:07:20] <ryanneufeld> possibly yeah
[13:08:48] <gnarf> i just rand the script by hand
[13:08:56] <ryanneufeld> oh
[13:09:00] <ryanneufeld> taht's what i'm doing :p
[13:09:01] <gnarf> and it updated
[13:09:06] <gnarf> so the cron isn't working
[13:09:13] <ryanneufeld> i put a crontab in /etc/cron.d
[13:09:17] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: can we just use the puppet "cron" type rather than the /etc/cron.d ?
[13:09:19] <ryanneufeld> I suppose it didn't get updated
[13:09:32] <gnarf> there are examples already in the infra repo of using it
[13:09:34] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I did not know there was a cron type
[13:09:37] <ryanneufeld> but yes, I can dothat
[13:09:38] <gnarf> it's badass
[13:09:55] <ryanneufeld> doing it now
[13:10:01] <gnarf> cron { "ircLogScript": minutes => "*/10", command => "...." } i think
[13:12:11] <ryanneufeld> testing locally now
[13:12:27] <ryanneufeld> ==> jq05: Warning: Unrecognised escape sequence '\*' in file /tmp/vagrant-puppet-2/manifests/nodes/citadel.pp at line 12
[13:12:27] <ryanneufeld> ==> jq05: Warning: Unrecognised escape sequence '\;' in file /tmp/vagrant-puppet-2/manifests/nodes/citadel.pp at line 12
[13:13:02] <gnarf> hrm
[13:13:33] <gnarf> hrm
[13:13:45] <gnarf> I think that should be in singlequotes
[13:13:50] <ryanneufeld> k
[13:13:52] <gnarf> so the \ is the shell escape on that
[13:13:58] <gnarf> not puppet escape on that
[13:14:13] <ryanneufeld> k
[13:14:34] <ryanneufeld> that looks to make it happy
[13:15:18] <gnarf> s5fs: care to comment on that, I think I'm right that you intended those \ to be in the command executed, not escape chars parsed in puppet
[13:15:27] <gnarf> thats your cron job

[13:16:05] <ryanneufeld> arg
[13:16:09] <ryanneufeld> I keep getting dconned
[13:17:09] <s5fs> gnarf: I think that's correct
[13:17:09] <ryanneufeld> Warning: Setting templatedir is deprecated. See http://links.puppetlabs.com/env-settings-deprecations

[13:17:29] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: lots of deprecated stuff in puppet, i've been researching an upgrade
[13:17:36] <ryanneufeld> cool
[13:17:45] <ryanneufeld> well, that cron is now setup using teh crontype
[13:17:50] <ryanneufeld> lets check back in 20mins
[13:17:58] <ryanneufeld> make sure we can see this
[13:18:01] <ryanneufeld> ----MARK----
[13:18:07] <ryanneufeld> afk, food
[13:40:10] <gnarf> hrm
[13:40:15] <gnarf> I don't see it
[13:40:56] <gnarf> it seems to be executing: Jan 14 13:40:01 jq05 /USR/SBIN/CRON[22859]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /home/znc/ircLogScript.sh)
[13:41:11] <gnarf> I wonder if there is a path issue or something
[13:41:57] <gnarf> i think cron doesn't have /usr/local/bin
[13:42:01] <gnarf> which is where logs2html is
[13:42:11] <gnarf> but not 100% sure
[13:42:19] <gnarf> gonna override by hand for a sec to see if i can debug it
[13:44:14] <gnarf> yup
[13:44:20] <gnarf>  /home/znc/ircLogScript.sh: line 19: logs2html: command not found
[13:44:26] <gnarf> i'll fix it ryanneufeld
