[08:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone know where blog.jqueryui.com lives?
[08:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..nevermind, looks like DNS was being whacky for a bit.
[10:44:37] <danheberden> need feedback soon, so that i can get the cert installed by wednesday https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/140
[11:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think our CDN is busted.
[11:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> That or my DNS is busted.
[11:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> And now it's working again.
[11:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[12:00:05] <ajpiano> gnarf: http://events.jquery.org/jquery-conference-2009/
[12:00:13] <ajpiano> i guess we need a special redirect for that
[12:37:38] <gnarf> ajpiano: k
[13:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: code for email?
[13:38:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: eh?
[13:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> Can you point me at the code you use to send emails for the deploy scripts?
[13:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> Is it written in node or is it just a shell script?
[13:39:35] <gnarf> yeah, one sec
[13:39:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/gnarf37/node-notifier-server/blob/master/notify-mail.js
[13:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I want to use the same module for plugins.
[13:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I want to make a page on the infrastructure wiki about which modules we use for what tasks.
[13:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> But maybe that should go in a public repo.
[13:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, time to step away from the computer :-)
[13:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> Have a good weekend.
[13:43:44] <gnarf> later!
