[05:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> Did splunk move?
[05:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not able to connect to https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/ (no page or anything)
[05:55:17] <rworth> scott_gonzalez it's being migrated as we speak from one Helix unit to another
[05:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[05:55:52] <rworth> no estimate for completion, but gnarf_ is being kept up to date and keeping an eye while he travels
[06:11:08] <gnarf_> this got silly
[06:11:12] <gnarf_> lemme say btw
[06:11:32] <gnarf> i was telling them we should just rsync the data volume
[06:11:45] <gnarf> but 10 hours later, they are still copying the 500 gig drive image over 10gig from SSDs
[06:11:49] <gnarf> dunno whats taking so long
[06:11:57] <gnarf> arman has been a big help tho
[08:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> yay, it's back
[08:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: How can I get a larger view of a graph from one of the dashboards?
[08:30:25] <gnarf> ssh from the air isn't very responsive...
[08:30:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is splunk working then?
[09:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yeah
[09:40:10] <Krinkle> I'm going to create testswarm2 on jq03, re-run installer, copy over user table only (which is small), and update localSettings.json to point to that. Just to see if the db is related to this problem at all (e.g. its size and/or efficiency)
[09:43:09] <Krinkle> Not sure how to GRANT rights to the old user
[09:43:10] <Krinkle> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON testswarm2.* TO testswarm@'localhost';
[09:43:13] <Krinkle> that should do it, right ?
[09:47:19] <Krinkle> Ah, need CREATE,  as well, for the installer.
[09:49:44] <Krinkle> still not working, failing on "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX"
[09:49:59] <Krinkle> will grant ALL instead. not sure how to get what rights it has on the existing db
[09:51:24] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: Show grants for 'user'@'host'
[09:52:08] <Krinkle> looks like it has ALL there as well
[09:52:12] <Krinkle> in addition to "USAGE"
[09:52:15] <Krinkle> whatever that is for.
[09:52:42] <Krinkle> same as ALL ?
[09:52:48] <Krinkle> eh, anyway, back to work. 
[09:58:06] <Krinkle> run token.
[10:11:33] <gnarf> Krinkle:  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db.* to user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
[10:12:12] <Krinkle> I did GRANT ALL on testswarm2.* to testswarm@'localhost';

[11:50:31] <gnarf> ATTN: I had (mt) remove a bunch of the old sites that were dead from ac.mediatemple.com
[11:50:47] <gnarf> side effect: you now need to use the domain "ops.jquery.net" instead of "jquery.com" when logging in, same email pass

[15:32:36] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez - look for a "view results" link beside the graph in question
