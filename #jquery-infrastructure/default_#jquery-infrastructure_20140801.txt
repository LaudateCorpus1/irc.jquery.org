[10:50:13] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: you can create vars in puppet manifests
[10:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> So someone should do that for the node version :-)
[10:50:59] <ryanneufeld> how often is it going to change?
[10:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> Often enough to warrant the one minute of implementation. This should always be a one line change if possible: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/409fa4e62182d68a9f9eebcd323b6a01825b5981
[10:51:47] <ryanneufeld> this isn't JS
[10:51:50] <ryanneufeld> it's config management
[10:51:59] <ryanneufeld> there is always duplication
[10:52:43] <ryanneufeld> though in this case
[10:52:59] <ryanneufeld> the best solution, would be to update the nodejs class and set the version default value to the one you want
[10:53:12] <ryanneufeld> then you don't need to specify it anywhere, unless you want a different version
[10:54:23] <ryanneufeld> but that appears to be a submodule

[10:56:52] <ryanneufeld> which is owned by danheberden, does anyone else have ownership of it?
[10:59:44] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: are we using Heira for anything yet?
[10:59:52] <gnarf> not afaik
[11:00:08] <ryanneufeld> it would be perfect for what scott_gonzalez is asking about
[11:00:21] <ryanneufeld> afaik you can't create vars outside of a class in puppet, can you?
[11:01:26] <ryanneufeld> should we ingest a copy of danheberden's nodejs module? or just remove it as a git submod and include it in our repo
[11:01:50] <ryanneufeld> it's only one manifest
[11:01:54] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ^
[11:05:02] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: it's also never needed to be updated really :)
[11:05:33] <ryanneufeld> right
[11:05:40] <ryanneufeld> even more reason IMHO to pull it in
