[07:28:24] <ryanneufeld> systems still seem stable
[07:30:51] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/f77b36d594cc0f7491ed Mysql error logs from lastnight
[07:41:13] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: i'm trying to find the line that says "took down entire system"
[11:18:47] <ryanneufeld> ping ajpiano, danheberden, gnarf, are we any closer to knowing what happened last night?
[11:20:00] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: do you have the zabbix url handy? cc Krinkle?
[11:21:05] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: which server?
[11:21:13] <Krinkle> (the "took it down" thing from earlier)
[11:21:20] <ryanneufeld> which ever one is running zabbix
[11:30:48] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle, clarkbox https://citadel.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/irc/flashtimeline ?
[11:31:32] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: citadel.jquery.com/zabbix
[11:31:50] <gnarf> clarkbox: Poking the support crew - waiting to hear back
[11:33:04] <ryanneufeld> thanks gnarf
[11:33:28] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I assume you're aware of last nights events?
[11:38:51] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: jq01 locked up somehow
[11:38:57] <gnarf> dan had mt reboot
[11:39:08] <ryanneufeld> that's pretty much what went down
[11:39:11] <gnarf> can't find any evidence
[11:39:15] <ryanneufeld> nor could I
[11:39:19] <ryanneufeld> what runs on that machine?
[11:39:19] <gnarf> also, looking into why that splunk server is down
[11:39:26] <gnarf> nginx / php / wordpress
[11:39:35] <gnarf> mysql
[11:41:32] <ryanneufeld> I noticed on jq03, I think it was, that sometimes git commands get hung up
[11:41:40] <ryanneufeld> anything like that on that box?
[13:10:24] <clarkbox> gnarf, does the MT interface for the helix arch show whats up with that machine? it seems to be powered down
[13:11:13] <clarkbox> did that machine have another catastrophic hardware fail?
