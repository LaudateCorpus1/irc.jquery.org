[13:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa. Mozilla just put $25k toward js-git.
[14:17:01] <Krinkle> Hm.. why is neither $TMPDIR nor $TMP set on jenkins.jquery.com in bash?
[14:17:56] <Krinkle> my dotfiles pull script needs a temporary directory. `mktemp -d -t dotfiles` is apparently maxosx specific (the -t expands it to $TMPDIR/dotfies.XXXXX on OSX)
[14:18:19] <Krinkle> when passing $TMPDIR/dotfiles.XXXX manually it still works on osx, but now fails on Linux as it tries to create a directory in /
[14:18:28] <Krinkle> (as $TMPDIR is undefined apparantly)
[14:18:42] <Krinkle> gnu mktemp has a --tmpdir but that one doesn't exist on Mac.
[14:22:23] <gnarf> Krinkle: *shrug* - cuz it isn't set?
[14:22:43] <Krinkle> I thought I'd at least be able to rely on *that* being defined
[14:24:27] <Krinkle> alrighty, `mktemp 2>/dev/null || mktemp -d -t 'dotfiles'`
[14:24:30] <Krinkle> that works on both
[14:24:46] <Krinkle> (gnu mktemp requires no arguments, on Mac it prints the help message)
[14:24:51] <Krinkle> with an erro code
[14:25:09] <Krinkle> Thx for the bounce
[14:29:27] <Krinkle> mktemp -d > /dev/null *
[14:29:33] <Krinkle> 2>*

[17:55:24] <gnarf> okay - CDN has been switched to new service - if you hear of any problems please don't hesitate to call/text/google hangouts/etc me - ring all the bells :) cc ajpiano s5fs ryanneufeld danheberden DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez clarkbox
[17:55:52] <DaveMethvin> yay! thanks gnarf!
[17:55:59] <DaveMethvin> much less ugly
[17:59:09] <gnarf> so some of it might still be being hosted via (mt)
[17:59:19] <gnarf> however - i proxied even their requests to go to the same design
[17:59:34] <gnarf> over the next week everyone should start pulling from maxcdn's stuff
[19:29:31] <s5fs> gnarf: awesome, great work!
