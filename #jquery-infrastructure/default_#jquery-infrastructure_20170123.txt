[18:00:40] <Krinkle> Where is the content for sizzlejs.com maintained? The wp-content migration seems to have been aborted and the gh repo removed. While that seems fine, it'd make sense for it to at least be versioned and puppetized in its current form as static site instsead.
[18:00:56] <Krinkle> Aside from sizzlejs.org redirect (broken) there seems to be no reference in puppet.
[18:01:00] <Krinkle> hosted elsewhere?
