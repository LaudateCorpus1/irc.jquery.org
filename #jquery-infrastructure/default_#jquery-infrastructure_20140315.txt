[12:50:35] <gnarf> s5fs: it shouldn't be logging to that file anymore - i must of left something in the config somewhere?
[20:48:50] <m_gol> gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs: it seems the config file for node-browserstack is not copied to the Jenkins box, see https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/248#issuecomment-37747890; can you help?
[20:49:13] <ryanneufeld> ping Krinkle|detached ^^^
[20:49:40] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: I'm not familiar with that stuff, you'll have to get ahold of Krinkle|detached
[20:49:47] <m_gol> k, thx
[20:50:16] <ryanneufeld> if you can tell me where it should be
[20:50:18] <ryanneufeld> and where i can find it
[20:50:23] <ryanneufeld> I might be able to take a crack at it
[20:55:01] <ryanneufeld> at the risk of stoking a fire, can someone give me a TLDR on this @nrrrdcore issue?
[20:55:37] <ryanneufeld> ^^ wrong chat
[20:59:03] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: it's file /usr/local/bin/tools/node-testswarm-config.json
[20:59:22] <ryanneufeld> which machine is this on?
[20:59:52] <m_gol> it's properly copied from https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/files/swarm/node-testswarm-config.json to jq03 but not to jenkins
[21:02:32] <ryanneufeld> ok
[21:02:40] <ryanneufeld> try now
[21:03:22] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: ^^
[21:05:39] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: I run `sudo puppet agent --test` on jq03 and jenkins still has the old file
[21:07:19] <ryanneufeld> I manually put the file there
[21:07:42] <ryanneufeld> from the link you gave me
[21:08:10] <ryanneufeld> I downloaded it from github, and put where you told me to
[21:13:50] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15mzgol opened issue #252: TestSwarm schedules too many jobs at once 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/252
[22:49:18] <s5fs> gnarf: okay i'll go look for the log setting and shut it off :)
