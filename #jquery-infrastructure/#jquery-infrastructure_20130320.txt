[08:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: I think gnarf is AFK all day
[09:40:31] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: oh, yeah
[09:40:33] <ryanneufeld> well, I upgraded some packages on jq02, was perl and puppet, so business as usual
[12:25:46] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/  http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[12:26:01] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[12:26:08] <Krinkle> that last one is wrong, isn't it?
[12:51:38] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: missed whatever scott_gonzalez said i was AFK for
[12:51:45] <gnarf> i quit limechat while giving a pres
[12:51:49] <gnarf> so lost my back scroll
[12:52:17] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: oh, i was just wanting to let you know i upgraded the packages on jq02
[12:52:27] <ryanneufeld> but not on 03 cause cause was apache and php
[12:53:08] <gnarf> so, my general approach is update stage then make sure nothings broken, and/or - screw it, ill fix any problems that show up anyway :)
[12:53:46] <ryanneufeld> so basically, if Im willing to baby sit the server if something goes wrong, I'm good to go on upgrades?
[23:16:30] <Stephan123> Hi there. I don't get any jquery news for some time now. I use rss-feed.
[23:16:31] <Stephan123> http://blog.jquery.com/feed/
[23:16:57] <Stephan123> But this only redirects to to blog page and is not a real rss-feed anymore.
[23:17:26] <Stephan123> Now I missed all news for a couple of months.
[23:17:47] <Stephan123> Can you fix it, please or can you tell me where to file a bug?
[23:18:34] <Stephan123> The HTML-code of the blog page states:
[23:18:35] <Stephan123> <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Official jQuery Blog &raquo; Feed" href="http://blog.jquery.com/feed/" />
[23:19:01] <Stephan123> Normally this means, that there should be a rss-feed.
