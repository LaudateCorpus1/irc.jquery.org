[07:37:20] <uGoMobi> gnarf s5fs : ping
[08:46:26] <gnarf> uGoMobi: in meetings most of the day today
[08:46:29] <gnarf> whats up
[08:47:08] <uGoMobi> gnarf: blog.jquerymobile.com needs to be setup
[08:55:42] <gnarf> what does that mean?
[08:56:04] <gnarf> we discussed a few very complicated plans surrounding that
[08:56:07] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez 
[08:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, based on the strange setup that was used for the old blog, I'm not sure what we'll need to do.
[08:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> The first attempt would be just adding DNS pointing to the existing WordPress install.
[08:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> I can see if I can salvage that.
[08:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> If not, we'll need to export the posts, do a new install, and import everything.
[08:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> Since blog.jquerymobile.com hasn't existed before, we can probably just use the live site while getting everything setup properly.
[10:25:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so you want me to point blog. at the old wordpress site?
[10:26:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm worried all the old content pages still leak then
[10:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I want.
[10:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> So I can access it.
[10:27:00] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll see if I'm able to clean it up or if we'll just need to do an export and start over.
[10:28:31] <gnarf> oh my god the office internets are terrible today
