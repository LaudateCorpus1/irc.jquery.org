[07:25:19] <jzaefferer> rworth: I haven't seen him around for a few days
[07:29:20] <ryanneufeld> nor have I
[07:29:31] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna be afk for about 1.5 hours
[07:29:52] <ryanneufeld> but I can try and assist when I get back, unless you needed something specifically from gnarf, rworth
[07:30:37] <rworth> ryanneufeld that would be great. I really need https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/159 fixed asap
[07:30:49] <rworth> it's a blocker for us to do final testing before launch this week
[07:31:01] <ryanneufeld> ok
[07:31:07] <ryanneufeld> I'll take a look when i get into the office
[07:31:12] <rworth> cool
[07:31:19] <ryanneufeld> I have to go catch a train, but I'll be back in about 1.5 hours
[07:31:31] <ryanneufeld> then I'll have a gander
[09:06:24] <ryanneufeld> rworth: what was that bug again?
[09:06:33] <rworth> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/159

[09:13:37] <jzaefferer> Scott is away erranding
[09:15:14] <ryanneufeld> dang
[09:21:34] <rworth> ryanneufeld there should be a deploy address in a config file somewhere. we just need it to point to https instead of http for the xml-rpc
[09:22:28] <rworth> try just specifying it even though it isn't normally specified
[09:22:39] <rworth> thinkin maybe that's what scott_gonzalez did
[09:22:54] <rworth> I remember he wasn't sure if it would work, then it did
[09:23:24] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:27:35] <ryanneufeld> rworth: does it work now?
[09:27:54] <rworth> let me commit and push to test
[09:29:35] <ryanneufeld> and does stage. need to be https?
[09:29:47] <ryanneufeld> oh, it does
[09:29:55] <rworth> stage.jquery.org and jquery.org need to be https
[09:29:58] <rworth> no other sites
[09:30:09] <rworth> ryanneufeld ready for me to test?
[09:30:22] <ryanneufeld> lemme edit stage.
[09:31:16] <ryanneufeld> try now
[09:32:03] * rworth pushed
[09:32:57] <rworth> ok, that worked. thanks ryanneufeld 
[09:33:29] <ryanneufeld> ok
[09:33:38] <ryanneufeld> I'll figure out how to puppetize those then :)
[09:33:43] <rworth> great
[09:33:52] <rworth> when you're done with that, can you help with something else?
[09:33:57] <ryanneufeld> maybe
[09:34:06] <rworth> let me know
[09:34:07] <ryanneufeld> I'll certainly try
[09:34:34] <ryanneufeld> for now puppet is turned off on jq02 and jq02.stage untill i can get this puppetized
[09:38:37] <rworth> ryanneufeld it looks like jquery-wp-content is not updating on stage.jquery.org
[09:38:42] <rworth> I just pushed a test
[09:38:57] <rworth> oh just kidding
[09:39:06] <rworth> it is working, but something isn't right. I'll keep digging
[09:39:12] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:39:16] <ryanneufeld> I'm taling the syslogs
[09:39:29] <ryanneufeld> so gimme a ping before you push again :)
[09:39:40] <ryanneufeld> at least then I can watch for it
[09:45:05] <rworth> ryanneufeld I figured it out
[09:45:11] <ryanneufeld> oh cool
[09:53:18] <ryanneufeld> rworth: I've got a meeting in 10mins
[09:53:46] <ryanneufeld> so I'll be afk for a while. Though puppet is disabled on jq02 so the config shoudl not revert. I'm testing it on a vm locally now
[09:54:07] <rworth> ok, let me know when you're back. I'd love to see if you can help with this other bit
[09:54:10] <rworth> thanks
[10:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: I'm here now.
[10:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org#stripe-integration should tell you what you need.
[10:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> rworth should have the keys
[10:24:23] <scott_gonzalez> But if you have any questions, let me know.
[13:14:00] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: that's for https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/159 that bug?
[13:14:04] <ryanneufeld> or something else?
[13:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Yeah, for #159.
[13:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, not for #159
[13:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> The https in config.json was for #159.
[13:18:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm working on 159 now
[13:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> rworth said to let you know what you needed to do for Stripe.
[13:18:28] <ryanneufeld> oh
[13:18:37] <ryanneufeld> haha, he hadn't even told me what was going on with that :p
[13:18:41] <ryanneufeld> I'll ping him in a bit
[13:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> :-P

[13:53:32] <ryanneufeld> rworth: scott_gonzalez I got #159 licked
[13:53:40] <rworth> awesome
[13:54:00] <rworth> ryanneufeld as scott_gonzalez mentioned, next is to configure stage. with some test keys for stripe
[13:54:21] <b-ot> Thanks for inviting me, ryanneufeld
[13:54:31] <ryanneufeld> #159
[13:54:38] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/159
[13:54:47] <ryanneufeld> oh right, not public
[13:54:48] <ryanneufeld> doh
[13:54:58] <ryanneufeld> rworth: what about stripe keys?
[13:55:14] <rworth> ryanneufeld dm
[13:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> So, for the Stripe keys, you should be able to look at the code that sets the DB info in wp-config.php
[13:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> And use that as a template for how to set the Stripe keys.
[13:59:46] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's all managed by puppet
[13:59:50] <ryanneufeld> and if only one of them uses it
[14:02:20] <ryanneufeld> so we only have one wordpress instance right?
[14:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[14:06:17] <ryanneufeld> k
[14:06:18] <ryanneufeld> cool
[14:06:21] <ryanneufeld> I think I got it sorted

[14:21:11] <rworth> ryanneufeld awesome. let me test it out
[14:21:17] <ryanneufeld> giver
[14:21:26] <ryanneufeld> if it doesn't work then /o\ I dunno
[14:21:36] <rworth> ryanneufeld and are we all set to configure different keys for prod when the time is right?
[14:21:43] <ryanneufeld> of course :)
[14:21:48] <rworth> yay
[14:21:55] * ryanneufeld is not messing about over here
[14:21:59] <ryanneufeld> okay, maybe a little
[14:22:05] <ryanneufeld> but mostly I'm not messing around
[14:25:21] <rworth> getting a 500 Internal Server Error
[14:25:26] <ryanneufeld> oh snao
[14:25:26] <rworth> ryanneufeld can you check the logs?
[14:26:07] <ryanneufeld> try again?
[14:28:32] <ryanneufeld> rworth: found it 
[14:28:33] <ryanneufeld> "PHP message: PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Stripe needs the CURL PHP extension.' in /var/www/wordpress/jquery-wp-content/mu-plugins/jquery.org/lib/Stripe.php:7

[14:35:31] <ryanneufeld> rworth: can you test now?
[14:35:37] <rworth> sure
[14:36:04] <ryanneufeld> also, a close up shot of breasts?
[14:36:26] <ryanneufeld> is that really how we're representing this? I mean sex sells...
[14:36:42] <ryanneufeld> But I can see that being off-putting
[14:37:13] <ryanneufeld> rworth: looks like it failed again
[14:37:18] <rworth> it did indeed
[14:37:26] <ryanneufeld> also see my previous?
[14:37:34] <rworth> I didn't find that shot particularly bad, but we could change it out
[14:37:43] <rworth> we certainly weren't trying to highlight anything like that
[14:38:52] <ryanneufeld> Yeah
[14:39:06] <ryanneufeld> it was the first thing I noticed
[14:39:11] <rworth> hmm
[14:39:18] <ryanneufeld> I was like who's those peop- OH boobs
[14:39:43] <rworth> I guess we should change it out. We don't want a scandal
[14:40:07] <ryanneufeld> after the html5 shiv fiasco
[14:40:19] <rworth> which?
[14:40:53] <ryanneufeld> oh, there was an epic bug thread about JR being a "well known homie"
[14:40:58] <ryanneufeld> and that it was a racist comment
[14:45:05] <ryanneufeld> okay, I ran a quick survey around our office
[14:45:12] <ryanneufeld> no one seems to think it's bad
[14:45:16] <rworth> ok
[14:45:39] <rworth> I mean, a smattering of people have seen it over the last year and this is I believe the first comment I've heard about it
[14:45:49] <rworth> I honestly had to look around the find what you were referencing
[14:46:02] <ryanneufeld> that settles it
[14:46:05] <ryanneufeld> I'm a pervert
[14:46:07] <rworth> thanks
[14:46:13] <rworth> haha
[14:46:25] <ryanneufeld> any how, I restarted php fpm
[14:46:30] <ryanneufeld> it should be working now I hope
[14:54:10] * rworth tests again
[14:55:47] <rworth> ryanneufeld it worked! :)
[14:56:03] <ryanneufeld> \o\  /o/ \o/
[14:59:15] <rworth> ryanneufeld does puppet mean these same issues won't plague us when we go to prod?
[14:59:54] <ryanneufeld> rworth: I can make that happen
