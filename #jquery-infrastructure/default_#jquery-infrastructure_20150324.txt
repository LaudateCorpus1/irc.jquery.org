[05:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: ping
[05:13:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i sent corey a message
[05:13:18] <arschmitz> on hangouts 
[05:13:36] <arschmitz> probably get that quicker
[05:14:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: he already answered he said he will check soon 
[05:27:07] <gnarf> back
[05:28:57] <gnarf> disk space alarms
[05:29:10] <gnarf> looking for stuff to delete
[05:29:29] <gnarf> also, how long has login on jquery ui trac been broken
[05:32:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz: got the old server back up
[05:32:53] <gnarf> but the password file is still corrupt
[05:32:56] <gnarf> and I can't login
[05:33:24] <gnarf> so if you're logged in, don't log out - but try in a incognito?
[05:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure. We've gotten a lot of complaints over time about not being able to log in.
[05:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> I've manually reset passwords for people before.
[05:37:45] <gnarf> for instance
[05:37:51] <gnarf> your password is not in the databse anymore 
[05:37:52] <gnarf> nor is mine
[05:38:01] <scott_gonzalez> Oh wonderful
[05:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> So I should go change my password now?
[05:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> Or will that potentially just kill my ability to login?
[05:44:44] <gnarf> yeah i'm not sure
[05:44:52] <gnarf> i'm digging through the backups looking for an uncorrupted file
[05:44:56] <gnarf> figure thats the best bet
[05:45:25] <gnarf> we noticed this problem when we were trying to setup bugs.jqueryui.com on the new server
[05:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> How's the upgrade going with the Trac guys?
[06:05:01] <arschmitz> yeah i have not been able to log in for like a week i think 
[06:07:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we spent one night looking at it on thursday
[06:07:14] <gnarf> it blew up in our faces
[06:07:17] <gnarf> couldn't login 
[06:07:24] <gnarf> couldn't get tickets to work once logged in
[06:07:30] <gnarf> ryan said he'd look into it
[06:07:33] <gnarf> last i heard
[06:07:57] <arschmitz> gnarf: yeah s5fs mentioned that on friday i think to me as to why i might not be able to login 
[06:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ryan Ollos?
[06:08:14] <gnarf> I'd really appreciate it if you can try to make it to the next 'hackathon' as the one person who knows how trac should behave for ui 
[06:08:16] <gnarf> yeah scott_gonzalez 
[06:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Thursday nights?
[06:09:04] <gnarf> not sure what the next plan is, but perhaps if you could ping the email and offer times we might be able to work with your presence :)
[06:09:22] <gnarf> ryan said he might be looking into some stuff on sunday
[06:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I was going to say this Thursday won't work for me :-P
[06:09:40] <gnarf> but like i dunno if anything happened
[06:10:29] <gnarf> also sorry if trac is running extra slow right now
[06:10:40] <gnarf> I'm trying to uncompress the old password file out of like 400 backup tarballs
[06:10:52] <gnarf> to find out when it went bad
[06:11:06] <gnarf> the earliest backup is definitely "safe"
[06:11:08] <gnarf> so
[06:11:24] <gnarf> somwhere between 2014-07-01 and 2015-03-28 we had a corruption problem
[06:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Binary search!
[06:12:01] <gnarf> yeah
[06:12:14] <gnarf> hard to do when pulling the one file you need out of the tar takes like 10 minutes
[06:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> At least dates are easy to do that with.
[06:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...at 10 minutes it might actually be faster to automate with git.
[06:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's figure out the max tries.
[06:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> It's like 8 tries?
[06:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> Might not be worth it to automate.
[06:18:20] <gnarf> you got a btree for me to use? :)
[06:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a black walnut tree that makes a mess in my backyar that you can have :-P
[06:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> That's what the b stands for in btree, right?
[06:22:27] <gnarf> :)
[06:22:36] <gnarf> I just did an ls-1 and am using vim to find midways
[06:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> I would've just used the first of the month.
[06:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> You're effectively just looking between months 7 and 15. You should be able to bisect on the first of the month until you find the actual month and then start cutting that in half :-)
[06:25:14] <gnarf> yeah, but now i have a list of 240 archives to check - and might as well just keep cutting the list in half :)
[06:27:08] <gnarf> all these spam accounts
[06:27:43] <gnarf> well backup-2014-11-24 has your account, but not mine
[06:27:56] <gnarf> i dunno where to treat that in my binary search
[06:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....probably as bad
[06:29:17] <gnarf> yeah, going to check the earliest backup to see if I have an entry in that one
[06:29:30] <gnarf> it's possible that my account got "bumped off" the list long ago
[06:29:31] <gnarf> also
[06:29:43] <gnarf> who the fuck uses .htpasswd files for auth *cough* trac
[06:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> This will just reset passwords, right? It won't remove any accounts?
[06:30:23] <gnarf> I assume so
[06:30:27] <gnarf> I have no idea
[06:30:29] <gnarf> i mean
[06:30:32] <gnarf> your account still works
[06:30:36] <gnarf> even tho you aren't in the password file
[06:36:24] <gnarf> okay
[06:36:29] <gnarf> earliest backup doesn't have my account
[06:36:30] <gnarf> so whatever
[06:37:07] <gnarf> oh man
[06:37:13] <gnarf> earliest backup has corruption too
[06:37:21] <arschmitz> oh joy
[06:37:37] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure trac is terrible
[06:37:43] <gnarf> can we just abandon ship?
[06:37:49] <arschmitz> lol
[06:38:01] <arschmitz> gnarf: that came up in last weeks meeting 
[06:38:31] <arschmitz> gnarf: everyone agreed to give it one last chance then
[06:38:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: does this count as that last chance lol?
[06:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> Resetting passwords for active users after the upgrade seems fine.
[06:39:46] <gnarf> if we can get through the upgrade...
[06:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> All the accounts are still intact. If the reset password form works after the upgrade, it's barely a problem that we've lost all passwords.
[06:40:27] <gnarf> okay
[06:40:32] <gnarf> can you reset my password
[06:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:40:55] <gnarf> then I can reset yours
[06:40:59] <gnarf> seems safer
[06:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...there's actually no gnarf user.
[06:41:28] <gnarf> which we know is BS
[06:41:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: can you reset mine too lol
[06:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> And no scott.gonzalez user :-/
[06:41:46] <arschmitz> oh no
[06:41:47] <gnarf> unless you deleted me
[06:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> And no arschmitz.
[06:41:57] <gnarf> so yeah
[06:42:02] <gnarf> trac is fcuked
[06:42:14] <arschmitz> this is bad
[06:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like all the real users are gone.
[06:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe you should revert to one with me.
[06:43:40] <gnarf> what i don't understand
[06:43:48] <gnarf> is that the password file should just be passwords
[06:43:50] <gnarf> we should still be users
[06:43:58] <gnarf> and TRAC_ADMIN or whatever
[06:44:00] <gnarf> that flag is
[06:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> The permissions are still there.
[06:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> So if anyone creates an account with one of our usernames, they'll get those permissions.
[06:44:55] <arschmitz> oh fun
[06:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, there's no direct relationship to users because the subject for a permission can be a user or a group.
[06:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> And a permission can be a permission or a group :-P
[06:46:19] <arschmitz> so any one could log in get full admin and wipe everything out right now lol
[06:46:31] <arschmitz> just need to pick the right user name
[06:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Are you currently logged in?
[06:47:07] <gnarf> no
[06:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to try to create a new account with your username and see what happens.
[06:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it says "Another account or group with that name already exists."
[06:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> The user admin page must only pull from the password file.
[06:47:59] <gnarf> but you can't force change the password?
[06:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> So let me try changing your password even though you're not in the list.
[06:48:46] <gnarf> im pretty sure the trac auth thing we are using is broken when too many users register it seems to have corrupted it's own .htpasswd file
[06:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that works.
[06:48:59] <gnarf> but we are also like 3 years out of date
[06:49:03] <gnarf> what'd you set me to?
[06:49:26] <scott_gonzalez> just PMed
[06:49:32] <gnarf> k
[06:49:34] <gnarf> changed
[06:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> And now you show up in the list, with your full info.
[06:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Just reset your password too.
[06:50:53] <arschmitz> thank you
[06:50:59] <gnarf> do you think it's worth restoring an old password file?
[06:51:07] <gnarf> or do we just deal with the problem one entry at a time?
[06:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> I reset my password too :-)
[06:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> Let's just leave it.
[06:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> We can reset as needed and once the upgrade is done, hopefully the reset password form will work for everyone.
[06:53:19] <gnarf> also
[06:53:28] <gnarf> 3 new accounts/password changes since you reset your own password
[06:53:48] <arschmitz> that seems like a lot fast
[06:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's all spammers.
[06:58:54] <gnarf> where the hell are the name/email stored?
