[00:20:00] <clarkbox> crinkle - there is something wrong with the cronjob that runs testswarm-browserstack run.sh script
[00:20:15] <clarkbox> krinkle (damn you os x spell check)
[07:51:54] <Krinkle> clarkbox: What's wrong?
[07:53:20] <Krinkle> clarkbox: testswarm is idle, 240+ runs everywhere
[07:54:53] <Krinkle> "/tools/testswarm-browserstack/run.sh: line 4: /var/log/testswarm-browserstack/cli.log: Permission denied "
[07:54:58] <Krinkle> (in run.log)
[08:58:59] <Krinkle> k, fixed.
[08:59:09] <Krinkle> and cron is running again
[09:50:07] <clarkbox> what was the problem? permissions on the file?
[09:50:12] <clarkbox> krinkle?
[10:34:33] <Krinkle> clarkbox: Yes
[10:34:50] <Krinkle> clarkbox: i guess you tried to test/execute it as your self, that didn't work so you did it with sudo.
[10:34:57] <Krinkle> that created the cli.log file owned by root
[10:35:11] <Krinkle> so when the cronjob (form user=jenkins) tried to take over after testing, it wasn't allowed.
[10:57:06] <ryanneufeld> fun stuff
[10:57:17] <ryanneufeld> FYI you can su jenkins
[10:57:39] <ryanneufeld> so if you're dicking with jenkins files on the filesystem
[14:14:27] <ryanneufeld> I have some questions for the peeps in charge of the jenkins builds, who would I ask about that?
[14:15:00] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer? clarkbox?
[14:15:10] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin?
[14:18:32] <clarkbox> i know a little. whats up ryanneufeld?
[14:18:58] <ryanneufeld> well, I'm finding the git plugin to be a bit annoying
[14:19:12] <ryanneufeld> I have a few repos that need checking out to run our tests
[14:19:19] <ryanneufeld> (not jquery related)
[14:19:25] <ryanneufeld> I was just wondering how you guys have it setup
[14:19:39] <ryanneufeld> or if I could get an account to poke around and look at the config
[14:19:50] <clarkbox> i think you can self register
[14:20:08] <clarkbox> if you need higher level access than what if gives you, let me know and i can add you
[14:20:14] <ryanneufeld> what's the url?
[14:20:20] <ryanneufeld> (I should know it)
[14:20:28] <ryanneufeld> but I 'm lazy and dun wanna look it up
[14:20:31] <clarkbox> i think some of our stuff uses scripts to kick stuff off
[14:20:39] <clarkbox> swarm.jquery.com:8080
[14:20:43] <clarkbox> or that could be .org
[14:20:56] <clarkbox> it is swarm.jquery.org:8080
[14:22:12] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:22:18] <ryanneufeld> I can see the console out put
[14:22:24] <ryanneufeld> but that's about it
[14:22:43] <clarkbox> k let me add you to admin role
[14:22:47] <clarkbox> if i can remember how...
[14:22:48] <ryanneufeld> thx
[14:23:09] <ryanneufeld> jenkins->manage
[14:23:11] <ryanneufeld> people
[14:23:37] <clarkbox> whats your username?
[14:23:42] <ryanneufeld> ryanneufeld
[14:23:52] <ryanneufeld> exciting I know
[14:25:17] <clarkbox> so you can't see this: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/configure
[14:26:12] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/3Z0J3I1p1H1k
[14:26:13] <ryanneufeld> nope
[14:27:23] <clarkbox> seems the permissions have to be done via config
[14:27:25] <clarkbox> files
[14:29:08] <ryanneufeld> oic
[14:29:16] <ryanneufeld> well, I probably have access to those then :P
[14:29:42] <clarkbox> i am trying to decipher the insanity
[14:29:50] <clarkbox> you do! /var/lib/jenkins
[14:29:54] <clarkbox> in jq03
[14:30:05] <ryanneufeld> yus
[14:30:10] <ryanneufeld> I can access that
[14:30:14] <clarkbox> dont worry
[14:30:16] <ryanneufeld> but the user perms aren't in puppet?
[14:30:19] <clarkbox> i should have it done shortly
[14:30:32] <clarkbox> i don't think so
[14:32:59] <ryanneufeld> doesn't look like it
[14:34:20] <clarkbox> its odd - you should have an entry for your username within config.xml
[14:34:29] <clarkbox> but you dont
[14:34:44] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[14:37:11] <clarkbox> …looking for a "flush to disk" button… but that would be silly
[14:37:22] <ryanneufeld> it would be
[14:41:20] <clarkbox> ok found a permission configuration interface
[14:42:41] <clarkbox> k try now
[14:43:01] <clarkbox> for the record… its here (1/2 down this page) http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/configure
[14:43:07] <ryanneufeld> bingo
[14:43:08] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[14:43:32] <ryanneufeld> oh, ours looks diff
[14:44:11] <ryanneufeld> ah
[14:44:17] <ryanneufeld> I see how you're doing it now
[14:59:17] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: note that the jenkins config related to testswarm / qunit is all public and documented on the wiki
[14:59:30] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki/Automated-Distributed-Continuous-Integration-for-JavaScript
[14:59:31] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: thanks
[15:27:10] <Krinkle> clarkbox: I'm working on something that will remove the need for updating the map.js for ever.
[15:27:59] <Krinkle> Once TestSwarm is migrated from browscap to ua-parser we'll have new configuration abilities that allow the API to expose browser/os/device family and versions directly instead of testswarm-specific uaID
[15:28:14] <clarkbox> cool
[15:28:27] <Krinkle> which means we only have to map ua-parser keys to browserstack keys ("browserFamily" to "browser" and "osFamily" to "os" etc.)
[15:28:39] <Krinkle> which we can since browserstack has /browsers to get all available browsers.
[15:29:09] <Krinkle> which means we also never make the mistake of trying to start a worker for a browser template that doesn't exist (right now the map can contain anything and we'll pass it to /worker blindly)
[15:31:17] <clarkbox> that will be a nice addition
[15:31:21] <Krinkle> Hm.. one thing can get tricky though. BrowserStack has versions as one string.
[15:31:27] <Krinkle> e.g. "12.0" or "4.3.2"
[15:31:52] <Krinkle> So we'll have to do some trial-and-error in the code to make it find the most precise match
[16:30:12] <clarkbox> jzaefferer https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/jquery_ui_download_builder
[16:30:22] <clarkbox> splunking the download builder
[18:45:19] <Krinkle> Nice, we have secure.wm.o redirects now!
[18:45:24] <Krinkle> (wrong channel)
[18:50:53] <Krinkle> clarkbox: jzaefferer: yay, experimental iOS working in testswarm/testswarm-browserstack: http://cl.ly/image/1W2V1F2k2I0e
[18:51:09] <Krinkle> lots of changes in my working copy for both jquery/testswarm and testswarm-browserstack though
[18:51:19] <Krinkle> time to build up commits and stuff
[18:51:33] <Krinkle> (this includes the entire ua-parser branch)
