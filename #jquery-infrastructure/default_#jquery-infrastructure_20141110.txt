[12:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs: ^
[12:44:26] <gnarf> hrm
[12:44:32] <gnarf> whats even writing to that
[12:44:36] <gnarf> can we remove it?
[12:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> No idea, it doesn't look very useful.
[12:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it's dumping the PHP super globals.
[12:50:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Maybe just truncate it for now and then look into what's writing to it?
[12:50:30] <gnarf> agree
[14:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Are we using `target:XXX` for grunt deployments?
[14:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress#config
[14:45:39] <scott_gonzalez> You asked me to implement that a while ago.
[14:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this was from jzaefferer, not you.
[14:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it'd be good to get confirmation that we're definitely not using this for our deploys. I want to drop this.
[14:49:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we are not using that AFAIK
[14:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[14:49:26] <gnarf> which is at like a 98% confidence
[14:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm ripping Grunt out of the heart of grunt-wordpress ;-)
[14:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> This will allow us to update lots of deps for our sites.
[14:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> It should also make testing saner, should I decide to actually write tests.
[15:09:43] <Krinkle> O_O
[15:09:46] <Krinkle> ^_^
[15:09:47] <Krinkle> yay
[15:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like things are actually working. I might have a first pass at this working tonight :-)
[15:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> We'll have to see how thorough I can be with testing this. Handling all the possible errors the first time was quite time consuming.
[15:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> I do love how small these tasks have become though...
[15:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> grunt.registerTask( "wordpress-validate", function() {
[15:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> 	client().validate( this.async() );
[15:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> });
