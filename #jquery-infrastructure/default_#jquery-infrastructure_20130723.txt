[10:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: Making some progress on the ability to remove a plugin: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/commit/9889587ce7281b2199c19969ff20cc912108c3ff
[10:59:59] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Scott Gonz√°lez (1m 22s ago): Added script to remove a plugin release.
[11:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't think this is the right approach.
[11:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> I think this script just needs to do the verification that the plugin version exists, then queue the deletion by adding an action to the sqlite db.
[11:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> Because we need to be able to rebuild the entire WordPress site by replaying the actions.
[11:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'll work on that change.
[11:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> But if either of you have time to review this script for sanity, that'd be good.
