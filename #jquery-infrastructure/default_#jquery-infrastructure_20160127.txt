[10:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ryanneufeld: ZNC doesn't seem to be working.
[10:55:21] <scott_gonzalez_> And now it's working.
[10:55:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez_: ok
[10:56:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez_: would have looked :)
[10:56:33] <scott_gonzalez_> arschmitz and I both couldn't connect to any channels.
[10:56:44] <scott_gonzalez_> I had to connect to freenode directly to send that message.
[10:57:00] <scott_gonzalez_> And as soon as I sent it, I got a message from ZNC saying that I was connected.
[12:02:29] <scott_gonzalez_> gnarf_ I'm having trouble changing my nick back.
[12:02:38] <scott_gonzalez_> So I can't op in #jquery-meeting, which means I can't unmute.
[12:03:38] <scott_gonzalez_> ajpiano agcolom jzaefferer s5fs Can someone unmute #jquery-meeting?
[12:04:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez_: /msg nickserv identify scott_gonzalez pass
[12:04:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez_: /msg nickserv release scott_gonzalez
[12:04:15] <gnarf> then nick
[12:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
