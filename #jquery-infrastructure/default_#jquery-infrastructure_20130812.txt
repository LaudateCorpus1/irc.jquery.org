[07:37:32] <gnarf> Krinkle|detached: so what happens that creates a dozen requests using php there?
[08:45:27] <orkel> gnarf: testswarm does it
[08:46:02] <orkel> when it start runs unit test on every browser, which is "expansive" on ajax tests
[08:46:38] <orkel> is that a memory or a config issue
[08:46:39] <orkel> ?
[09:25:33] <gnarf> orkel: i can probably bump up the number of allowed things, but those should all be "short" requests anyway
[09:25:42] <gnarf> i mean the wordpress server serves WAY MORE php requests
[09:25:50] <gnarf> what are we doing that makes testswarm ajax php suck?
[09:33:05] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:33:42] <orkel> gnarf: i'm not sure, but jaubourg might know about it
[09:33:58] <jaubourg> hey gnarf
[09:34:10] <jaubourg> what did I do wrong? ;)
[09:34:13] <orkel> jaubourg: we have a problem with ajax tests they take too much memory to run
[09:34:35] <jaubourg> oh, it's a memory issue?
[09:34:36] <orkel> any ideas?
[09:34:42] <orkel> apparently
[09:35:00] <gnarf> i don't think so
[09:35:02] <jaubourg> hmmm...  weird but I've seen weird stuff with garbage collectors in browsers lately
[09:35:40] <gnarf> basically when like 90 requests hit the server during a swarm run through the ajax unit suite, it bogs down the php-fpm server
[09:35:50] <jaubourg> not related to ajax but I had this project where the browser was crashing because it didn't try and garbage collec. Had to trick with setTimeout(tm)
[09:35:58] <jaubourg> oh, so it's php side
[09:36:01] <gnarf> yeah
[09:36:03] <gnarf> server side
[09:36:09] <gnarf> something is running very slowly
[09:36:23] <jaubourg> well, we could split tests more, that's one of the things we had in the rewrite that never made it
[09:36:32] <gnarf> i don't get it because the wordpress server deals with like 4* the requests
[09:37:00] <jaubourg> I honestly have no idea. We use wait quite a lot, could that be an issue (like stacking stuff)
[09:37:09] <jaubourg> maybe it's because of the session and everything is blocked?
[09:37:17] <gnarf> jaubourg: like server sleep?
[09:37:20] <jaubourg> yep
[09:37:23] <gnarf> eww
[09:37:30] <gnarf> thats probably it
[09:37:47] <jaubourg> like I said, there's a need for some cleanup
[09:37:48] <gnarf> i can look into it later this week, stay on my ass about it orkel - today is bad though
[09:37:59] <gnarf> i can increase the pool of runners
[09:38:03] <gnarf> quite a lot i think
[09:38:08] <orkel> okay, will do :-)
[09:38:15] <jaubourg> let me know if I can help
[09:38:33] <orkel> it would be a great day if we can finally deal with those failures
[09:38:52] <orkel> thank you for joining jaubourg
[09:39:21] <jaubourg> np, hope I could be of little help
[11:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: How are we handling WordPress updates?
[11:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> Are we going through the admin interface?
[11:34:37] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: core or content?
[11:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> core
[11:34:56] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: no clue, sorry.
[11:35:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I've been downloading the new version unzipping it on the server, moving the wordpress folder out of the way and replacing it with the new one
[11:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...Shouldn't we be going through the normal upgrade process?
[11:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> To make sure we get an scripted changes.
[11:37:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats the upgrade process nacin had suggested to me last time i asked about it
[11:37:08] <gnarf> but it might of been becuase we were updating to RCs
[11:37:18] <gnarf> imo, try the upgrade via admin interface on stage
[11:37:20] <gnarf> if it works
[11:37:22] <gnarf> we can use it
[11:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> We should ping nacin just to verify.
[11:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> We're on 3.5.1 and 3.6 is latest.
