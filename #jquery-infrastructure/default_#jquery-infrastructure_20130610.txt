[10:09:02] <_|Nix|_> Hey! D'you guys know what's a good grunt plugin for taking an HTML file and returning a DOM-like tree? I'm thinking something like libxml2, but for HTML, and in JS.
[10:18:34] <_|Nix|_> Ideally, I'd need a utilty function rather than a task, because I'd like to do the parsing from a task.
[10:27:23] <_|Nix|_> I see that jsdom might be what I'm looking for.
