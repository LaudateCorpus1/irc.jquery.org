[07:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> bugs.jquery.com seems busted.
[07:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9521
[09:06:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: full disk :/
[09:10:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: got it back
[13:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks gnarf
[14:07:09] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: do you think you'll have time to take a look at that wp-content vm?
[14:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: I can try it right now.
[14:07:27] <ryanneufeld> cool
[14:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> Just pull that branch again?
[14:07:42] <ryanneufeld> do a reset --hard on that branch from my fork
[14:07:42] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:08:02] <ryanneufeld> and if you can point me in a direction for a PR that would be great
[14:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've pulled your updates.
[14:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> Do I use the same .box file?
[14:09:02] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:09:05] <ryanneufeld> it should pull a new one
[14:09:22] <ryanneufeld> what's the output from `vagrant box list`
[14:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-contribute (virtualbox)
[14:09:46] <ryanneufeld> vagrant box remove https://mydb8.phx1.cbsig.net/phpmyadmin/
[14:09:49] <ryanneufeld> whooops
[14:10:02] <ryanneufeld> vagrant box remove jquery-contribute
[14:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now I've got:
[14:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> There are no installed boxes! Use `vagrant box add` to add some.
[14:10:31] <ryanneufeld> k
[14:10:38] <ryanneufeld> now a fresh pull from my branch
[14:10:44] <ryanneufeld> and vagrant up will download it for you
[14:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> The guest additions on this VM do not match the installed version of
[14:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> VirtualBox! In most cases this is fine, but in rare cases it can
[14:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> prevent things such as shared folders from working properly. If you see
[14:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> shared folder errors, please make sure the guest additions within the
[14:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> virtual machine match the version of VirtualBox you have installed on
[14:11:56] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's fine
[14:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> your host and reload your VM.
[14:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> Guest Additions Version: 4.2.1
[14:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> VirtualBox Version: 4.1
[14:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
[14:12:06] <ryanneufeld> oh
[14:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!
[14:12:13] <ryanneufeld> you need virtualbox 4.3 I think
[14:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> Stdout from the command:
[14:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> Stderr from the command:
[14:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> stdin: is not a tty
[14:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:12:41] <ryanneufeld> http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/VirtualBox-4.3.6-91406-OSX.dmg
[14:12:55] <ryanneufeld> not sure if it's needed http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.3.6-91406.vbox-extpack
[14:12:59] <ryanneufeld> but I always install that too
[14:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> I swear I updated this while we were in San Diego.
[14:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> Doing it again.
[14:14:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I thought you did as well
[14:14:08] <ryanneufeld> I know you upgraded vagrant
[14:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't have vagrant installed before.
[14:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> But I remember manually opening VirtualBox to update it.
[14:16:19] <ryanneufeld> odd
[14:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> The VirtualBox about window is busted. The close/minimize/maximize buttons don't work :-P
[14:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, that's updated to 4.3.6 now.
[14:17:06] <ryanneufeld> okay
[14:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> Running `vagrant up` again.
[14:17:14] <ryanneufeld> vagrant destroy && vagrant up
[14:17:26] <ryanneufeld> nah, do a destroy first
[14:17:28] <ryanneufeld> vagrant destroy && vagrant up
[14:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:18:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it's downloading the box again. It didn't do that before. So the remove alone wasn't enough.
[14:18:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:19:01] <ryanneufeld> I was wondering why it happened so fast :P
[14:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[14:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> fail early, fail often?
[14:19:44] <ryanneufeld> something like that
[14:20:02] <ryanneufeld> so turns out, it should have worked for you, but I had the wrong box download url
[14:24:35] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: eta?
[14:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> Download is done, it's doing some config stuff now.
[14:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> Now it's booting...
[14:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> Just finished, no error.
[14:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> Now what do I do?
[14:32:26] <ryanneufeld> vagrant.jquery.com
[14:32:27] <ryanneufeld> does it work
[14:32:38] <ryanneufeld> you should be able to finish the WP install
[14:33:01] <ryanneufeld> then deploy to vagrant.* by updating the config.json in the content repos
[14:33:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that worked.
[14:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try to deploy to it.
[14:34:59] <scott_gonzalez> awesome :-)
[14:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: This is fantastic.
[14:39:35] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: :)
[14:39:51] <ryanneufeld> cool
[14:39:59] <ryanneufeld> so now i have to write up the docs for it
[14:40:06] <ryanneufeld> and then I'll ping you about landing this change?
[14:40:14] <ryanneufeld> I have a talk on the 25th
[14:40:28] <ryanneufeld> if possible I'd like to release it that night at the end of my talk
[14:40:37] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: does that work for you?
[14:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that sounds good. When do you think you'll have a PR ready?
[14:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we'll have a few days of review time.
[14:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> You should probably send PRs for the smaller stuff ahead of time.
[14:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> Like changing the uploads directory.
[14:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> And squash some of the other commits like renaming the box.
[14:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> And we should have DaveMethvin test it on Windows.
[14:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: I'm not opposed to .gitkeep, but this suggestion seems good: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7229885/gitignore-vs-gitkeep#comment15172056_7229996
[14:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm open to whatever others think works best though.
[14:47:30] <ryanneufeld> I can do a README file
[14:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> Using a dotfile does seem a bit cleaner.
[14:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> Since most code will ignore dotfiles, so they're "safer"
[14:47:46] <ryanneufeld> I've seen .gitkeep and .keep
[14:48:02] <ryanneufeld> and .gitkeep is pretty clear for those who 'get' git
[14:48:13] <ryanneufeld> that without a file the Dir won't be added
[14:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> This is another option: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11579945/143007
[14:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> .gitkeep seems fine too though.
[14:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to pretend I never said anything :-P
[14:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> Everyone watch as I bikeshed with myself...
[14:59:16] <ryanneufeld> haha
[14:59:57] <ryanneufeld> Git cannot add a completely empty directory. People who want to track empty directories in Git have created the convention of putting files called “.gitkeep” in these directories. The file could be called anything; Git assigns no special significance to this name.
[15:10:13] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: truth
[15:18:54] <ryanneufeld> so, I'm pretty stoked about this now
[15:19:10] <ryanneufeld> I'll pull together a couple PR's
[15:25:38] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: when is your talk?
[15:25:55] <ryanneufeld> 14:40 ryanneufeld: I have a talk on the 25th
[15:25:57] <s5fs> also, i received verbal approval to chat about my current project!
[15:26:03] <ryanneufeld> nice
[15:26:14] <ryanneufeld> so you can officially tell me things
[15:26:16] <s5fs> ah you have plenty of time to prep
[15:26:26] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: yes, so pretend all i shared with you was post-dated info
[15:31:56] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: yeah man
[15:33:02] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: have your slides ready?
[15:33:08] <ryanneufeld> hahahahhaha
[15:33:09] <ryanneufeld> no
[15:33:15] <s5fs> i'll sit thru your presentation via ghangout whenever
[15:33:32] <s5fs> its something of a tradition to write your slides the night before, after 9p
[15:33:36] <s5fs> do not disappoint ;)
[15:34:23] <ryanneufeld> hahah
[15:34:27] <ryanneufeld> yeah, seems to be the case
[15:36:31] <ryanneufeld> s5fs or scott_gonzalez can either of you help me out with some node code?
[15:43:21] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: yeah whats up
[15:43:33] <ryanneufeld> i was gonna ask about reading node CLI args
[15:43:35] <ryanneufeld> but I found it
[15:43:43] <s5fs> i really like optimist for that
[15:44:10] <s5fs> but that may be old and busted now, i haven't looked for a new solution in a while since it works fine
[15:44:26] <ryanneufeld> process.argv is not enough?
[15:45:14] <s5fs> that works fine too, depending on what you wanna dooby doo
[15:45:34] <s5fs> if you want -option value style args, optimist works well
[15:46:33] <s5fs> using argv means you have to ensure argument order is correct
[15:46:35] <s5fs> nbd
[15:50:42] <ryanneufeld> I only care about the [2]
[15:50:47] <ryanneufeld> array in dex
[15:50:49] <s5fs> the deuce
[15:50:52] <ryanneufeld> uesh
[15:50:54] <ryanneufeld> *yesh
[15:50:56] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[15:51:00] <ryanneufeld> having off by one typos
[15:51:31] <s5fs> off by one? by all means use positional arguments ;)
