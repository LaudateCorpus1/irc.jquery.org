[02:14:48] <m_gol> I'm getting 504s on http://swarm.jquery.org/
[02:15:00] <m_gol> gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs ^
[02:15:43] <s5fs> m_gol: i'll take a look
[02:16:56] <s5fs> m_gol: damn i'm not even sure i have an account for it haha! where are you seeing 504s?
[02:17:08] <m_gol> I didn't have to login or sth
[02:17:17] <m_gol> just going to the page returns 504
[02:17:54] <m_gol> ha, but not in incognito
[02:17:56] <s5fs> can you confirm the ip? the page loads for me
[02:18:28] <s5fs> so it works for you in incognito mode?
[02:19:24] <m_gol> yes, in incognito it's fine and it also allows me to log in then; in the regular mode (I was logged in when it started happening) I get 504 after a certain delay
[02:19:32] <m_gol> so weird
[02:19:59] <m_gol> and I've already refreshed, like, 10 times in the past 10 minutes so it's consistent
[02:20:37] <m_gol> clearing cookies helped
[02:20:41] <m_gol> weird
[02:21:41] <m_gol> that still shouldn't happen, right? :)
[02:21:51] <s5fs> m_gol: yeah, i'm guessing the 504 page was just cached for you. looking at host logs for the past 3 hours and all seems well, steady traffic.
[02:23:56] <s5fs> m_gol: haha it does look like a backup is running right now though
[02:25:13] <m_gol> ok, thx!
[02:26:54] <s5fs> i'm going to bed but alex should be on in a couple hours. if you have any issues or continue to see errors please ping him on irc, he knows how to get ahold of me if things go sideways. thanks!

[15:46:14] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: So, how many years before we get testswarm.com :P
[15:46:20] <Krinkle> Let's put a wager down xD
[15:46:33] <Krinkle> I'm down for 10$ for "2015, later or never"
[15:46:46] <ryanneufeld> I have no idea what you're on about
[15:47:17] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/38
[15:47:19] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: 
[15:48:41] <ryanneufeld> Oh, yeah, I'm not holding my breath
[15:48:57] <Krinkle> http://blog.musicbrainz.org/2013/12/05/using-cakes-for-social-engineering/
[15:49:02] <Krinkle> reminds me of that!
[17:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> Can we get events-old.jquery.org as an alias for events.jquery.org?
[17:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> Or any equivalent?
[17:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> I want to get the new events.jquery.org deployed, but there are a few pages that haven't been ported and I'll need to redirect to the old site.
[17:17:30] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I"ll take a look
[17:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks ryanneufeld.
[17:19:20] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: done
[17:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> That was quick :-)
[17:19:51] <ryanneufeld> dnsmadeeasy
[17:19:54] <ryanneufeld> made it easy
[17:19:57] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[17:21:08] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: apparently I did it on the wrong service... mea-culpa
[17:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[17:21:18] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: can you do it?
[17:21:29] <ryanneufeld> I dunno how to do the new one though
[17:21:39] <scott_gonzalez> So easy a caveman can do it.
[17:21:42] <ryanneufeld> so you'll have to ask s5fs
[17:22:14] <ryanneufeld> I don't have access to the new one yet
[17:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm gonna head home. We'll get the new site live tomorrow.
[17:22:21] <ryanneufeld> kk
[17:22:22] <ryanneufeld> later
[17:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for trying.
[17:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> later
