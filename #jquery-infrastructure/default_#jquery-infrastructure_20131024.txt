[11:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> Can someone look into why view.jqueryui.com doesn't have the menu-style branch?
[11:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs
[11:47:36] <danheberden> hmm
[11:48:04] <danheberden> (granted i have no idea how the new view.* works)
[11:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> Does it not update if grunt fails?
[11:49:08] <arschmitz> danheberden: https://github.com/jquery/node-web-git-proxy
[11:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...might be a problem with the lock file.
[11:49:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i know failing tests are fine
[11:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe a process died and left the lock in place.
[11:49:36] <arschmitz> not sure about other failures 
[11:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this lock has been in place for 10 days.
[11:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna try deleting the lock.
[11:50:29] <arschmitz> seems reasonable
[11:51:16] <danheberden> if it's regarding git, does that make it a "master lock"
[11:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:54:43] <gnarf> heh
[11:54:49] <gnarf> lockfile is a likely cause yeah
[11:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> It's running now, just taking a while.
[12:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, all updated and no more lock file.
[14:19:38] <ryanneufeld> perhaps a check of /proc/ for the pid would be helpful
