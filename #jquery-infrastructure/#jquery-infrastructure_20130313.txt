[10:41:09] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: are you around and could help with a Jenkins issue?
[10:41:57] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: in a bit
[10:42:07] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: what's the problem?
[10:43:22] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: I've documented it here: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/162
[10:44:11] <jzaefferer> specifically this SO answer https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/162 seems important, since our servers don't have any swap space at all
[11:03:40] <ryanneufeld> ugh, MT has terrible memory management
[11:04:30] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: how much ram does that process neeD?
[11:04:41] <jzaefferer> I have no clue
[11:04:45] <jzaefferer> this used to work
[11:05:16] <jzaefferer> we've updated phantom and jenkins recently, so one of those updates might be related
[11:05:38] <ryanneufeld> node /tools/testswarm-browserstack/src/cli.js --config /tools/testswarm-browserstack/config.json --run-loop 60
[11:05:45] <ryanneufeld> loop 60?
[11:06:30] <ryanneufeld> also it seems jenkins is already using 500MB of ram
[11:06:41] <ryanneufeld> which shouldn't be an issue either
[11:06:58] <ryanneufeld> so this machine has 8GB of ram and that's not enough?
[11:07:43] <ryanneufeld> I take that back, jenkins has 2.5GB allocated to it
[11:08:31] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: there is 5 testswarm processes running rightnow
[11:11:35] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: what "testswarm process" are you referring to?
[11:11:41] <ryanneufeld> the node
[11:11:44] <ryanneufeld> Feb15   1:50 node /tools/testswarm-browserstack/src/cli.js --config /tools/testswarm-browserstack/config.json --run-loop 60
[11:11:53] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:11:57] <ryanneufeld> that one has been running since Feb 15
[11:11:58] <jzaefferer> there shouldn't be five, I think
[11:12:01] <ryanneufeld> is that correct?
[11:12:12] <jzaefferer> but as long as the system isn't out of memory, this doesn't matter
[11:12:22] <jzaefferer> the thing is that Jenkins fails to build up a new process
[11:12:30] <jzaefferer> while there's plenty of system memory
[11:12:48] <jzaefferer> Java memory handling is special, but I don't really understand enough of what's going on here
[11:13:03] <jzaefferer> I guess there's no way to get swap space to avoid the issue, so we need to find some other way
[11:13:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:13:29] <ryanneufeld> the way MT does that is kind of a pain
[11:13:34] <ryanneufeld> cause when the machine runs out of ram
[11:13:35] <ryanneufeld> it just fails
[11:14:11] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: is it safe to restart jenkins?
[11:14:34] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: should be, yeah. You can do a shutdown within Jenkins so that it can finish jobs that are currently running
[11:14:44] <ryanneufeld> not sure if I have a login
[11:14:46] <jzaefferer> nothing running right now though
[11:14:47] * ryanneufeld trys
[11:14:51] <jzaefferer> so just restart it
[11:15:04] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:15:05] <ryanneufeld> I do
[11:15:17] <jzaefferer> I've clicked the "prepare for shutdown" button
[11:15:30] <jzaefferer> ah, you killed it already :-)
[11:15:33] <ryanneufeld> k
[11:15:49] <ryanneufeld> gonna killa it
[11:15:51] <ryanneufeld> *kill it
[11:15:58] <ryanneufeld> and make sure none of it's children are alive
[11:16:06] <ryanneufeld> that sounded vaguely mobish
[11:17:47] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: how much ram do you want it to use?
[11:17:56] <jzaefferer> *shrugs*
[11:18:19] <jzaefferer> let's try with more mem?
[11:19:04] <ryanneufeld> gave it 3GB
[11:19:18] <ryanneufeld> and it took 3.5
[11:19:20] <ryanneufeld> okay
[11:19:37] <ryanneufeld> lets watch it for a week or so?
[11:23:20] <jzaefferer> I'll run a jQuery UI job to see if it runs
[11:23:42] <ryanneufeld> I'm running one for jqm 1.1
[11:23:43] <ryanneufeld> just to see
[11:24:07] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[11:24:11] <jzaefferer> was wondering where that came from
[11:24:17] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, that was me :p
[11:24:24] <ryanneufeld> also I upgraded to 1.505
[11:25:51] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: so, keep an eye on it
[11:26:04] <ryanneufeld> I'm starting to see the appeal of travis though :p
[11:28:38] <jzaefferer> I don't know why mobile's phantomjs build take so frickin long to run :/
[11:28:58] <jzaefferer> or why its testing 1.1 stable anyway
[11:29:06] <jzaefferer> no one is working on that anymore, right?
[11:29:43] <ryanneufeld> I manually triggered that one
[11:30:24] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: it's qunit tests that are running right now
[11:37:15] <jzaefferer> I still see the jQuery Mobile build runnin
[11:37:17] <jzaefferer> *running
[11:37:22] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:37:25] <ryanneufeld> it takes a long time
[11:37:47] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.1-stable/264/console
[11:37:52] <ryanneufeld> you can see the output there
[11:38:20] <jzaefferer> well, this was working before, so its really not that interesting
[11:38:29] <jzaefferer> I'll cancel that build
[11:41:24] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: didn't help: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/1012/console
[11:41:31] <jzaefferer> to test, run a jQuery UI build
[11:41:45] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-9.html perhaps we could use the overcommit configuration to help with not having any swap?
[11:43:08] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: hmm... so phantomjs is crashing
[11:53:04] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: what does the dump file tell you?
[11:53:11] <ryanneufeld> I'm not able to actually read it
[11:53:18] <ryanneufeld> ./minidump_stackwalk /tmp/0bbdeff8-b1d8-03cd-2a61fa45-415455cb.dmp .
[11:53:42] <ryanneufeld> -bash: ./minidump_stackwalk: No such file or directory
[11:53:45] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: ^^
[13:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: nopt actually looks nicer than optimist.
[14:55:50] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: minidump_stackwalk is in my user dir on that server. There's instructions for installing and using that here: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/Crash-Reporting
[15:28:13] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: I followed those, in my home directory
[15:28:16] <ryanneufeld> it didn't work
[15:28:17] <ryanneufeld> :S
[15:31:02] <jzaefferer> weird
[15:31:05] <jzaefferer> I got it working once
[15:31:56] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: I got this as output: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/342f32ba75157b71dc54
[15:32:50] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: crash address 0xbbadbeef
[15:32:54] <ryanneufeld> bad beef...
[15:32:59] <ryanneufeld> that'll get you every time
[17:33:14] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: jzaefferer: Now there is only 1 testswarm-browserstack process.
[17:34:03] <Krinkle> You can sometimes see 2 processes with that word in it, but only one is the run-loop deamon. That deamon periodically spawns a child and when it finishes, after some time, spawns a new one, but never more than one
[17:34:13] <Krinkle> meaning the total should never be more than 2 (1 parent, 1 chidl)
[17:35:36] <ryanneufeld> i swa 5
[17:40:36] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: When I ran htop, i was seeing 5 or six of them
[17:40:55] <Krinkle> did they go away automatically or did you kill them?
[17:44:51] <ryanneufeld> went away when i restarted jenkins
[18:11:27] <Krinkle> that'd be a coincidence as it isn't connected to jenkins (related, but not aware or linked in any way)
