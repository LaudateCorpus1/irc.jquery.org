[11:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you have time to talk about some stuff in about 30-60 minutes?
[11:34:30] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I totally forgot about that ticket
[11:34:35] <ryanneufeld> so sorry
[11:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, it's not super important, especially since we're working in a branch on jquery-wp-content.
[11:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> It'd just make it easier to show stuff without having people do the local setup.
[11:35:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: probably
[11:35:51] <ryanneufeld> so basically you need to change the git repo it's pulling from on stage, correct?
[11:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Yeah, right now it's doing some custom thing, I think.
[11:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> Since web-events is a private repo.
[11:36:24] <scott_gonzalez> The new setup is the standard site deployment process.
[11:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> But just for stage since it's still a work in progress.
[11:37:26] <ryanneufeld> oh
[12:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ready?
[12:39:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hangouts, irc, phone?
[12:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> Anything with voice.
[12:40:27] <gnarf> hangouts me then, i'll answer on my phone :)
[12:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy. You're really testing my ability now...
[12:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> I think Hangouts is about to break my laptop :-P
[17:56:13] <s5fs> hangouts is a resource hungry pig
[17:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hangouts is my arch enemy.
[18:07:24] <s5fs> Time is my arch enemy but Hangouts is certainly a jerk
[18:07:40] <s5fs> i mean, i have to reboot my phone regularly because it just won't end a call, stupid.
