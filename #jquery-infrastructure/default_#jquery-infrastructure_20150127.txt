[06:21:20] <ajpiano> sites down? gnarf s5fs ?
[06:21:27] <gnarf> fyi *.jquery.com is down for a little bit - upgrading the host it's running on - was getting a little slammed today
[06:21:31] <ajpiano> ahh
[06:21:33] <gnarf> its up again now
[06:21:47] <gnarf> you caught me in the like 5 minutes it was doing its thing :)
[06:22:26] <gnarf> more cores, more ram
[06:22:35] <gnarf> hope it sustains better through the snow day traffic
[06:26:06] <gnarf> seems more stable already
[06:26:13] <gnarf> load avg was up at like 20 before the resize
[06:26:15] <gnarf> down to 5 now
[16:09:52] <danheberden> gnarf s5fs is there a plan for CVE-2015-0235 patching?
