[12:47:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[12:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yup
[12:50:28] <gnarf> skype?
[21:32:38] <gnarf> danheberden: you around?
[21:32:52] <gnarf> danheberden: lets figure out how much we need to pay for domains before monday?
[21:34:06] <gnarf> *.jquery.com , *.jquery.org , *.jqueryui.com , *.jquerymobile.com , *.sizzlejs.com(do we need *?), *.qunitjs.com  
[21:34:53] <Krinkle> (is testswarm.com already moved?)
[21:39:55] <gnarf> *.testswarm.com ;)
[21:40:04] <gnarf> though i don't think we have any subdomains there
[21:40:08] <gnarf> just testswarm.com yeah?
[21:40:41] <Krinkle> I mean https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/38
[21:41:24] <gnarf> seems still locked
[21:41:33] <gnarf> having communication/timing problems i think
[21:41:47] <gnarf> we need to call john one of these days and figure that out too (cc danheberden)
