[13:37:21] <clarkbox> i am trying to get vagrant going
[13:37:34] <clarkbox> having trouble connecting after a machine has been brought "up"
[13:38:25] <clarkbox> have you guys had any problems?
[13:38:32] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: how are you connecting?
[13:38:37] <clarkbox> trying via RDP
[13:39:33] <clarkbox> netstat shows no 3389
[13:39:34] <ryanneufeld> vagrant ssh
[13:39:39] <clarkbox> ooohhhh
[13:39:50] <ryanneufeld> vagrant ssh <machine type>
[13:40:03] <ryanneufeld> so vagrant ssh jq02.stage for example
[13:40:06] <clarkbox> cool
[13:40:12] <ryanneufeld> RDP is usually used for GUI's
[13:40:23] <ryanneufeld> and you have to stand the machine up with the RDP protocol enabled
[13:40:27] <ryanneufeld> if you just need a shell
[13:40:29] <clarkbox> also, i am seeing some errors while provisioning citadel. are you aware of those?
[13:40:30] <ryanneufeld> vagrant ssh is the best
[13:40:44] <clarkbox> ya thats what i was wondering
[13:40:47] <ryanneufeld> I think I've seen those, though I'm not sure what the solution is
[13:41:04] <clarkbox> virtualbox GUI showed that the display was RDP
[13:41:11] <ryanneufeld> interesting
[13:41:23] <clarkbox> anyway, i am in now. thanks for th ehelp
[13:41:27] <ryanneufeld> np
[13:41:58] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: I'm gonna stand up citadel now, see what those errors are
[13:42:06] <ryanneufeld> are there any GH issues for them?
[13:42:17] <clarkbox> i can email you my log
[13:42:24] <clarkbox> i didn't look
[13:42:37] <ryanneufeld> ryan+jquery@neufeldmail.com
[13:42:58] <clarkbox> i think some of them are innocuous
[13:43:30] <clarkbox> but there is a repeated MySQL error
[13:43:42] <ryanneufeld> oh, hmm
[13:45:10] <ryanneufeld> warning: Unrecognised escape sequence '\.' in file

[13:45:12] <ryanneufeld> those?
[13:45:21] <ryanneufeld> I've seen those. I'm not sure how to fix them
[13:45:22] <clarkbox> ya that too
[13:45:45] <clarkbox> dpkg-preconfigure: unable to re-open stdin:
[13:45:54] <ryanneufeld> that's normal
[13:46:06] <ryanneufeld> it's because there is no tty attached to the session

[13:46:38] <ryanneufeld> ah, that's an issue

[13:46:47] <ryanneufeld> I have your logs
[13:47:01] <ryanneufeld> I can't spend much time on it now, but I'll take a closer look when I get home
[13:47:14] <clarkbox> ok thanks for the help
[13:47:22] <clarkbox> ill see if i can sort some of it out myself
[13:51:14] <ryanneufeld> yeah, if you find a solution, email it to that thread, and either I'll add it, or you could probably do a PR against puppet-stage
[14:48:38] <ninjanlu> hello folks
