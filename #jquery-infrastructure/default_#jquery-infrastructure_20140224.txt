[08:03:42] <gnarf> s5fs yeah, looks good
[09:14:56] <s5fs> gnarf_: okay i'll merge and push later today. i've come down with a nasty cold, today is the peak probably. i cannot see out of my left eye haha!
[09:15:03] <gnarf> s5fs: ack! orange juicin' ? :)
[09:15:04] <s5fs> just woke up but yes
[09:15:06] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: wow man, sounds like whatever hit you hit you hard
[09:15:07] <s5fs> slept 12hrs, which never hapens
[09:15:07] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: yeah you got to see me in the early stage yesterday, when it was just sniffles
[09:15:08] <s5fs> by 4p it was ON
[09:15:10] <ryanneufeld> ugh
[09:15:10] <s5fs> i ran out and set up backups for a local tattoo shop and looked a mess
[09:15:10] <ryanneufeld> nast man
[09:15:11] <s5fs> yes, not cool
[09:15:11] <ryanneufeld> nasty too
[09:15:12] <s5fs> i was hoping it was just allergies but nope
[09:15:13] <s5fs> too many trips in a row i guess. took this one home from vegas, probably.
[09:15:17] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that makes sense
[09:15:19] <gnarf> more likely the plane
[09:15:20] <ryanneufeld> yeah, thats usually what does it for me
[09:15:21] <s5fs> i flew spirit air to/from vegas, they charged for everything but were otherwise a nice airline
[09:15:22] <s5fs> $7 for a capri sun pouch of booze, that wasn't terrible
[09:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> I would love to sleep 12 hours.
[09:59:15] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: not if you woke up feeling like i do
[09:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> Hell, I'd love to sleep 8 hours.
[09:59:29] <s5fs> most days i get 4-7hrs/sleep and that's more than enough
[09:59:38] <scott_gonzalez> I can very rarely sleep through the night :-/
[09:59:42] <s5fs> same, i wake often
[09:59:47] <s5fs> after having kids i'm a crazy light sleeper
[09:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I've had this problem my whole life.
[10:00:19] <s5fs> i don't have any recollection of how i slept as a kid
[10:00:24] <s5fs> time for some tussin
[10:00:28] <scott_gonzalez> I know what you mean about your body becoming sensitive to noise while sleeping after having kids though.
[10:00:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's that "holy shit is my baby still alive?" reaction.
[10:00:40] <ryanneufeld> I'm not looking forward to that
[10:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: It's like a horrible mind game.
[10:00:44] <s5fs> you'll adapt and overcome
[10:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> At first you're getting up at every single sound to check on them.
[10:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> Then when there is silence, you're wondering if they're still breathing :-P
[10:03:53] <s5fs> later, once you're a pro, you only get up when its a pain cry
[10:04:07] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah, the first year is crazy, you don't know what to expect 
[17:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: I'm ready now if you are.
[17:20:35] <ryanneufeld> I am ready
[17:20:46] <s5fs> I am also ready
