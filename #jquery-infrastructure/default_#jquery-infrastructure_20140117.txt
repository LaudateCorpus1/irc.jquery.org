[07:43:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez kborchers s5fs ryanneufeld i figured out how to get it to let me add more uses
[07:43:36] <gnarf> (newrelic)
[07:43:43] <gnarf> you all should have invites or something
[07:44:01] <kborchers> yep i saw :)
[07:44:12] <kborchers> gnarf: what do you think so far?
[07:44:31] <gnarf> i think i want to have an inside contact to send a ton of suggestions to
[07:45:16] <kborchers> so is that, "i don't like it" or "this is great but it could be better" type stuff?
[07:45:34] <gnarf> it's got like 30% of what I need - and the interface is much cleaner
[07:46:10] <gnarf> but until i do some more research / talk to an "insider" - I'm not sure if we will be able to replace zabbix
[07:46:36] <kborchers> ok, i'll see if i can track someone down
[07:47:01] <gnarf> basically - front end dev/design & application monitoring
[07:47:08] <gnarf> maybe 2 insiders
[07:47:15] <kborchers> ok
[07:47:18] <gnarf> there are some packages for like mysql monitoring
[07:47:22] <gnarf> but they require java :(
[07:49:20] <gnarf> and a package for nginx monitoring that requires ruby

[10:32:59] <ryanneufeld> you need to specify the .git
