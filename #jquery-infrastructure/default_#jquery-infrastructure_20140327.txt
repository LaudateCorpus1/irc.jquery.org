[04:37:19] <rxaviers> gnarf, I just had a chance to look at your IM question now. In theory, we have fixed DB (generateIcon) to work with all IM versions: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/commit/761d06143474544d9eedbf24c050c7fe4994210c (https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/132)
[04:37:51] <rxaviers> We've never had any problem in linux.
[04:38:11] <rxaviers> Although, we found an issue on mac using 6.8 (I guess scott_gonzalez was the one who found it) https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/144
[04:38:52] <rxaviers> For jenkins/testing point of view, I think there's no problem using whatever IM version. Because, unit tests don't actually test the image bytes.
[04:39:26] <rxaviers> For the download builder server, we need to monitor any changes to make sure the images are being generated correctly.
[04:39:41] <rxaviers> As I said, in theory they should.
[04:40:37] <rxaviers> gnarf, So... What has been upgraded? jenkins only or any other DB related server?
[05:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell nacin bugs.jqueryui.com only allows authenticated posts and we get spammed a lot. It's only bugs.jquery.com that's open to anonymous posting.
[05:26:50] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell nacin about that.
[05:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, and that bug came back and bit us for the last release because our release script was in a broken state and I rolled back to an old version to finish the release.
[05:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> That was a tough day. I was trying to fix the release while getting a tattoo. And you had just signed off so I couldn't ping you for help :-P
[05:29:34] <rxaviers> ouch /o\
[05:29:50] <rxaviers> I remember that
[05:30:47] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what do you think of my concern related to jenkins vs. DB server?
[05:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> I was wondering the same thing.
[05:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> Because in addition to changing OS, they changed to node 0.10.25
[05:31:35] <scott_gonzalez> 0.10.26
[07:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs danheberden ryanneufeld: ping
[07:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers, jzaefferer and I are trying to share a screen on jq02.stage, but we're getting:
[07:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> $ screen -x
[07:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> Cannot open your terminal '/dev/ttyp2' - please check.
[07:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> Any ideas?
[07:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, looks like sudoing was breaking it.
[07:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> We got it working now.
[08:12:27] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: yeah, it's cause the ttyp is owned by whomever starts it. So you have to ether change the ownership, or both be the same user
[08:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we were all logged in as rxaviers.
[08:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I just sudo'd so that we could `su - rxavires`
[08:13:05] <scott_gonzalez> But it wasn't working.
[08:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> We hacked around it by adding our ssh keys to his user :-/
[08:13:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's about the best you can hope for
[08:21:56] <gnarf> or just share a root screen that has su -'ed 
[08:21:58] <gnarf> :)
[08:22:24] <gnarf> i.e. everyone root sudos, then screens, then inside that screen su to rxaviers

[13:13:28] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: gnarf and I poked at trac last night, it appears that akismet isn't working correctly. for now people can submit tickets, but be on the lookout for spam.
[13:13:52] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: Do you know who manages the akismet account we're using?
[16:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: No idea.
[16:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> Probably nobody.
[16:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
