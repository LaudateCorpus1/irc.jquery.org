[11:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Isaac strongly recommends updating to node 0.8.20.
[12:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ryanneufeld: load average: 50.72, 50.93, 45.66
[12:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> jq03
[12:58:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's pretty high
[12:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> I could barely use vi.
[12:58:39] * ryanneufeld checks
[12:59:33] <ryanneufeld> what uses java?
[13:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> Jenkins?
[13:00:08] <ryanneufeld> ah
[13:00:12] <ryanneufeld> it's using 333% cpu
[13:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> Is that on that server?
[13:00:32] <ryanneufeld> teag
[13:00:34] <ryanneufeld> *yeah
[13:00:58] <ryanneufeld> looks like there are multiple python scrupts doing git stuffs
[13:01:09] <ryanneufeld> var/www/view.jqueryui.com/extractGitBranches.py
[13:01:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeha, seems excessive.
[13:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> That box has a LOT of active processes.
[13:02:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:02:08] <ryanneufeld> it's kinda getting a pounding
[13:02:14] <ryanneufeld> what's the port for jenkins?
[13:02:28] <ryanneufeld> 8080
[13:02:29] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:02:31] <ryanneufeld> not responding
[13:02:41] <ryanneufeld> what would the damage be if I restarted jenkins?
[13:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure.
[13:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer
[13:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> I can't imagine it's being too useful right now though :-P
[13:04:04] <ryanneufeld> true
[13:04:18] <ryanneufeld> also looks like the crons are overlapping themselves
[13:04:21] <ryanneufeld> which is a problem
[13:04:44] <ryanneufeld> wtf gnarf    30335  0.0  0.0  11888   840 ?        Ss   Jan30   0:00 ssh-agent
[13:04:57] <ryanneufeld> open connection since jan30?
[13:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:24:17] <ryanneufeld> man, no end to server issues today
[13:28:46] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: k, I managed to kill jenkins
[13:28:49] <ryanneufeld> and restart it
[13:29:03] <ryanneufeld> looks like it got stuck on one of the browser stack calls, or the git calls
[13:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> Is the load coming down?
[13:29:39] <ryanneufeld> it's down
[13:29:55] <ryanneufeld> also installed htop
[13:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> What's htop?
[13:30:52] <ryanneufeld> run it
[13:31:00] <ryanneufeld> it's a better top
[13:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[13:31:40] <ryanneufeld> pretty neat eh?
[13:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:32:49] <gnarf> hey
[13:32:51] <ryanneufeld> clearly the server gods are unhappy w/ me to day
[13:32:52] <gnarf> just woke up
[13:32:54] <ryanneufeld> *today
[13:33:00] <ryanneufeld> hey gnarf
[13:33:42] <gnarf> did restarting jenkins kill the load bomb?
[13:33:49] <gnarf> or was it the extract git branches?
[13:33:56] <ryanneufeld> it was both
[13:34:03] <ryanneufeld> I head to kill the jenkins process
[13:34:07] <ryanneufeld> before those would die
[13:34:17] <ryanneufeld> had to kill -KILL the pid
[13:34:18] <gnarf> the extract git branches is for view.*
[13:34:31] <gnarf> it should just be doing checkouts on branches
[13:34:32] <ryanneufeld> what is the point of that site
[13:34:42] <ryanneufeld> it was runing like 5 instance of it all
[13:34:50] <gnarf> basically a live demo of the repo
[13:35:04] <gnarf> there are 3 repos
[13:35:08] <gnarf> if something was taking a while
[13:35:13] <gnarf> on a 5 minute cron too
[13:35:20] <gnarf> if the machine was slowed down because of something else
[13:35:28] <ryanneufeld> 5mins?
[13:35:30] <gnarf> i could see 5 of em
[13:35:44] <ryanneufeld> that's fairly aggressive isn't it?
[13:35:46] <gnarf> every 5 minutes, it checks out every branch on jquery / jquery-ui and jquery-mobile
[13:35:58] <gnarf> the whole point is to see the "live update" of the repoo
[13:36:17] <ryanneufeld> github.com?
[13:36:42] <gnarf> like http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[13:36:51] <gnarf> github doesn't serve html, or parse php for testing
[13:37:06] <ryanneufeld> oic
[13:37:09] <ryanneufeld> so view is for testing
[13:37:22] <ryanneufeld> makes sense now
[13:37:37] <ryanneufeld> would it make sense to use the notifier server for that instead?
[13:37:51] <ryanneufeld> seems to me it might be more efficient to have it done that way
[13:38:04] <ryanneufeld> especially if you can have the queuing enabled like you suggested
[13:38:08] <gnarf> btw, got an update from chris lea
[13:38:16] <gnarf> if we have more ips that are blocked
[13:38:29] <gnarf> we need to file support tickets in the ac.mediatemple webpage
[13:38:37] <gnarf> easier than remembering an email
[13:38:40] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:39:01] <ryanneufeld> they should have a whitelist in their control panel honestly'
[13:39:11] <ryanneufeld> but tickets are better than emails
[13:45:10] <gnarf> danheberden: ^^^^
[13:45:29] <danheberden> gnarf: oh, that makes sense
[13:49:25] <gnarf> so after a restart of jenkins
[13:49:30] <gnarf> the load doesn't seem to be climbing?
[13:54:06] <ryanneufeld> not sure, it was steady last I checked
[13:54:12] <ryanneufeld> we're having production outages right now
[13:54:19] <ryanneufeld> so I'm on *that* before the weekend
[13:54:32] <gnarf> yeah
[13:54:35] <gnarf> no prob
[13:55:28] <gnarf> thx for restarting that
[13:57:44] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:57:51] <ryanneufeld> I'm already on high alert Lop
[13:57:53] <ryanneufeld> *lol
[13:58:26] <gnarf> looks like whatever was happening started at 12:10 (2 hours ago) http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=b55f002de3884719&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10056&graphid=411 
[14:00:41] <gnarf> Krinkle|detached: or jzaefferer either of you here?
[15:55:13] <ajpiano> gnarf: when i try to use splunk, i get Error in 'litsearch' command: Your Splunk license expired or you have exceeded your license limit too many times. Renew your Splunk license by visiting www.splunk.com/store or calling 866.GET.SPLUNK.
