[08:34:24] <gnarf> sup sup
[08:35:57] <scottgonzalez> I'm giving a presentation tomorrow and I want to show how quickly you can get our WordPress setup running.
[08:36:06] <scottgonzalez> So I want to start from cloning jquery-wp-content.
[08:36:25] <scottgonzalez> But I want to have a fallback just in case there are network issues.
[08:36:52] <scottgonzalez> Yesterday, I tried having two jquery-wp-content clones and running `vagrant up` on both, but the second one yelled at me about the box already existing.
[08:37:10] <scottgonzalez> So I'm wondering if there's a way to have a local copy of the box so that it doesn't need to be downloaded.
[08:37:40] <scottgonzalez> Basically, I want to have _jquery-wp-content and _jquery.com already cloned and sitting there.
[08:37:52] <scottgonzalez> But then I'll start from scratch and hope the network holds up.
[08:38:07] <scottgonzalez> If it doesn't, I'll just rename the already existing underscored directories and use those.
[08:38:33] <scottgonzalez> So I want _jquery-wp-content to already have the image available and just have it do the setup not the download.
[08:42:12] <gnarf> scottgonzalez: the .box?
[08:42:48] <scottgonzalez> yeah
[08:42:57] <gnarf> run "vagrant box list"
[08:43:03] <gnarf> do you see the base box?
[08:43:23] <scottgonzalez> $ vagrant box list
[08:43:23] <scottgonzalez> jquery-wp-content (virtualbox)
[08:43:25] <gnarf> vagrant box list -i
[08:43:30] <gnarf> does it have a download date?
[08:43:39] <scottgonzalez> yeah
[08:43:45] <gnarf> then you can spawn it up without network
[08:43:54] <gnarf> feel free to test to make sure
[08:43:59] <gnarf> but it should only download the box once
[08:44:13] <scottgonzalez> Ok, let me run `vagrant destroy` and see if it's still there.
[08:44:25] <gnarf> scottgonzalez: ls -al ~/.vagrant.d/boxes/ :)
[08:44:44] <scottgonzalez> Oh, so `vagrant destroy` doesn't delete the .box?
[08:45:00] <scottgonzalez> It just deletes the VM that was created from the .box?
[08:45:00] <gnarf> nope, just deletes the VM container
[08:45:04] <scottgonzalez> ok
[08:45:12] <scottgonzalez> So that should be perfect.
[08:45:38] <scottgonzalez> Clone jquery-wp-content, vagrant up, vagrant destroy, mv jquery-wp-content _jquery-wp-content
[08:55:57] <ryanneufeld> scottgonzalez: ping
[08:55:58] <ryanneufeld> whats's up
[08:56:03] <ryanneufeld> scottgonzalez: vagrant box list
[08:56:47] <scottgonzalez> Thanks ryanneufeld, gnarf answered my question.
[08:56:57] <scottgonzalez> I'll be showing off the vagrant setup tomorrow at WordCamp Lancaster :-)
[08:56:57] <ryanneufeld> scottgonzalez: oh ok
[08:57:04] <ryanneufeld> Nice
[08:57:41] <scottgonzalez> It's the only setup that works on this laptop right now :-P
[08:57:47] <scottgonzalez> I haven't installed MAMP or anything else.
[08:57:48] <ryanneufeld> perfect
[08:57:57] <ryanneufeld> that's exactly the point
[08:58:10] <scottgonzalez> yup
[08:58:11] <ryanneufeld> I gave a little talk about here on tuesday
[08:59:47] <scottgonzalez> Apple wants my laptop for 48 hours to verify my laptop issues are a dying HD.
[08:59:54] <scottgonzalez> That seems excessive to me.
[09:00:00] <ryanneufeld> scottgonzalez: should we update the config-sample.jsons?
[09:00:14] <ryanneufeld> scottgonzalez: that probably means they have a bunch of other machines
[09:00:17] <ryanneufeld> ahead of you
[09:00:31] <ryanneufeld> I took mine in for a look at the screen, they wanted it for a week
[09:00:42] <scottgonzalez> Yeah, we should probably update the samples.
[09:01:12] <ryanneufeld> ok
[09:01:13] <ryanneufeld> cool
[09:01:24] <ryanneufeld> I can do some PR's for that this weekend
[09:02:17] <gnarf> scottgonzalez: 2 days shipped back and forth?
[09:02:24] <gnarf> or like an apple store wants 2 days?
[09:02:29] <scottgonzalez> Apple store
[09:02:38] <scottgonzalez> ryanneufeld: sounds good
[09:03:18] <scottgonzalez> And they wouldn't let me just drop off my laptop and leave it with them yesterday. They said I had to be there during the appointment.
[09:03:54] <scottgonzalez> So I sat there for a while as their diagnostics ran, just to be told that I need to leave my laptop with them to run more diagnostics...
[09:05:40] <gnarf> scottgonzalez: kind of jealous you get to show off the vagrant setup :)
[09:06:03] <gnarf> my big reveal/step 1 of my demo for my wordcamp presentation was "DROP DATABASE wordpress;"
[09:06:24] <gnarf> even better to be like "let me DESTROY the VM and show you again!" :0
[09:06:35] <scottgonzalez> haha
[09:07:55] <ryanneufeld> I'm just happy it works lol
[10:52:19] <s5fs> scottgonzalez: seems easier to just replace your hdd
[11:05:21] <scottgonzalez> s5fs: That's what they're supposed to do. It's still under warranty.
[11:05:50] <scottgonzalez> But for some reason they want to run more diagnostics. Even though the test they ran yesterday indicated HDD problems.
[11:06:00] <s5fs> could be stall time for a part to arrive
[11:06:39] <s5fs> i paid for the highest tier of support for my current laptop, dell sends a tech to my office when it breaks
[11:06:54] <s5fs> which it did within the first 3mo, display started weirding out
[11:07:03] <s5fs> replacement panel has a bunch of dead pixels
[11:08:04] <scottgonzalez> :-/
[11:08:46] <s5fs> in short, nobody's happy. hope your machine gets fixed quickly.
[11:22:14] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: I have to say, that was the best part about Complete Care from dell, even accidents are covered
[11:22:17] <ryanneufeld> it's p cool
[11:22:42] <ryanneufeld> I ended up getting an upgraded machine because they had hardware issues with the ATI graphics in the version I bought.
[11:27:34] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: yeah, i was really mixed on the whole thing. on one hand it was nice to have repairs done in my office, otoh it broke within 3mo. not cool for a $2800 device.
[11:27:51] <ryanneufeld> but they fixed it right away
[11:27:57] <ryanneufeld> I'd call that a break even
[11:28:00] <s5fs> also it broke while i was on a business trip, so the convenience of repair was outweighted by the breakage
[11:28:07] <ryanneufeld> absolutely
[11:28:18] <s5fs> haha "break even", you're a savage
[11:28:21] <ryanneufeld> getting it fixed on the road next business day
[11:28:37] <s5fs> nope, waited until i returned before repairing it
[11:29:01] <s5fs> it was a two-day trip and it broke while i was in the airport
[11:29:54] <s5fs> i wish tech support had a 'professionals only' line i could call so i didn't have to repeatedly explain to the techs that i wasn't and would not run windows
[11:30:26] <ryanneufeld> They do
[11:30:32] <ryanneufeld> you have to ask for it though
[11:30:40] <ryanneufeld> they have a business support line
[11:30:51] <ryanneufeld> did you buy a business series machine?
[11:30:56] <s5fs> yeah i think i'm under smb so i get different support
[11:30:57] <s5fs> yeah
[11:31:02] <s5fs> xps 15
[11:31:19] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I had the latitudes
[11:31:54] <s5fs> HP should team up with JK Rowling and make some neat products like the HP Levioso
[11:43:23] <ryanneufeld> well, that would make it easier to throw them out the window
[11:45:38] <s5fs> heh my laptop is so heavy it would likely kill on impact
[11:46:31] <ryanneufeld> military applications: Check
[11:47:06] <s5fs> i like that it looks kinda mbp-ish
[11:48:06] <ryanneufeld> I find it funny that you spent almost as much as a MBP, but didn't get a MBP, But instead chose one that looks like a MBP
[11:51:39] <s5fs> yes
[11:51:59] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: voting w/ your dollars?
[11:52:08] <s5fs> yup
[11:52:48] <s5fs> i run linux anyways and figured the hw support may be better on the dell. i was wrong, but at least i like the laptop.
[11:59:03] <ryanneufeld> does it compute in a way you are willing to tollerate?
[12:00:17] <s5fs> what i really wanted was a 15" version of their xps 13 developer edition
[12:07:05] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I love the 15 over the 13
[12:07:15] <ryanneufeld> not sure why they got rid of the 14 tho
[12:07:22] <ryanneufeld> that was the sweet spot
[12:11:30] <s5fs> left the 14" market to lenovo i guess
[12:41:10] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I suppose so
