[07:23:17] <gnarf> s5fs: ping when you're around please - want to chat w/ you and kborchers 
[07:33:57] <s5fs> gnarf: ping
[07:34:04] <s5fs> i'm still in bed you savages, haha!
[07:34:28] * kborchers throws cold water on s5fs 
[07:35:06] <s5fs> noes!
[07:36:01] <gnarf> s5fs: wasn't trying to wake you up
[07:36:08] <gnarf> just have a good morning message waiting for you
[07:36:56] <s5fs> no worries, i was just spacing out thinking about my day
[07:37:51] <gnarf> im on a call right now, it feels like it will end soon
[07:38:01] <gnarf> kborchers: hangouts?
[07:38:12] <kborchers> sure
[07:38:27] <kborchers> let me jump on
[07:40:31] <s5fs> maybe i should get the chrome plugin, i feel like hangouts from within google+ kinda suck
[07:40:40] <s5fs> maybe i'm just used to skype
[07:41:49] <kborchers> the plugin stopped working for me on mavericks but i haven't tried recently ... couldn't access the camera
[07:42:07] <s5fs> haha!
[07:44:17] <s5fs> fine i'll put on pants
[08:04:01] <s5fs> kborchers: corey is free :)
[08:04:31] <gnarf> s5fs: we can use skype instead
[08:04:34] <gnarf> lets do that
[08:04:48] <gnarf> i figured you being on linux would have skype problems
[08:04:48] <gnarf> :)
[08:05:03] <gnarf> s5fs: the plugin still doesn't do the video/voice calls
[08:05:08] <gnarf> they still end up in a tab in chrome
[08:05:16] <s5fs> haha!
[08:05:22] <s5fs> i can do whatever
[08:05:29] <gnarf> kris is already on skype
[08:06:35] <s5fs> haha! skype crashed, wonderful
[08:59:09] <gnarf> jdorfman: ping as well
[14:15:38] <s5fs> gnarf: wanna do the hangout tomm evening-ish? i have a pdxnode organizers meeting in the morning.
[14:15:54] <gnarf> s5fs: i'm hoping we get some traction from maxcdn
[14:16:03] <gnarf> not sure this requires any work on our side now that i think about it
[14:16:23] <gnarf> i should be around most of the day though
[14:16:29] <s5fs> i saw some activity on gh but haven't had a chance to follow up yet, been a busy day over here
[14:17:10] <s5fs> sounds good, i expect to be free around 3p PST and beyond
[14:17:14] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I was able to extract a couple backups
[14:17:46] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: awesome, thanks
[14:17:54] <ryanneufeld> np, sorry for the delay
[14:18:14] <gnarf> i just want to make sure that more than me knows how to restore a backup
[14:18:46] <s5fs> i'll peform a restore over the weekend just so we have a trifecta of restorablility
[14:19:01] <s5fs> oh i did restore the db from trac once
[14:19:12] <ryanneufeld> is this still relevant https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/205
[14:19:28] <ryanneufeld> ping scott_gonzalez ^^
[14:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: I assume so.
[14:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling it's own of those ticking time bombs.
[14:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> At any moment they might change IPs and we'll be screwed.
[14:49:39] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's true
[16:50:43] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf
[16:50:53] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: sup
[16:51:27] <ryanneufeld> i've notice something odd about the jenkins setup
[16:51:44] <ryanneufeld> there is a bunch of directories like /var/lib/jenkins/builds.jenkins.jquery.com
[16:52:07] <ryanneufeld> but oh, wait, so the jquery::niginx::simplephp uses builds.jenkins
[16:52:20] <gnarf> builds is where it hosts the output
[16:52:20] <ryanneufeld> bit there are build.jenkins.jquery.com directories
[16:52:29] <ryanneufeld> being created lower in the file
[16:52:36] <ryanneufeld> are both correct?
[16:54:16] <ryanneufeld> gnarf https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/jenkins.pp#L34-59
[16:55:11] <gnarf> not sure what if anything that path is used for
[16:55:23] <gnarf>  /var/www/builds.jenkins..... 
[17:06:38] <gnarf> maybe jzaefferer or Krinkle|detached 
[17:45:44] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: its empty on the live server
[17:45:50] <gnarf> so i'm pretty sure it's just a typo
[17:45:56] <gnarf> that never got removed
[17:46:05] <gnarf> feel free to yank it out
[23:18:28] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ok
