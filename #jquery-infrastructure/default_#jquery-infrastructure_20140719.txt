[14:23:07] <Jesse_V> hello everyone
[14:23:19] <Jesse_V> I have a question, is anyone around?
[14:26:10] <Jesse_V> hello?
[15:24:54] <Jesse_V> is anyone around?
[15:30:37] <Jesse_V> I'd like to report a problem with the JQuery UI website
[15:43:43] <Jesse_V> hello nacin, could you help me out?
[18:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> Jesse_V: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/new
[18:18:35] <Jesse_V> scott_gonzalez: that's the best place, yes?
[18:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, the bug tracker is the best place to report problems.
[18:18:53] <Jesse_V> ok, thanks
[18:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you actually have a question, which is what you said at first.
[18:30:17] <Jesse_V> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/89
[18:30:51] <Jesse_V> that's my report, my question was why it was happening
[18:32:27] <Jesse_V> thanks Scott
[20:18:58] <s5fs> Jesse_V: I have confirmed that we cannot reach jquery properties from tor. however, I'm not sure how to troubleshoot such an issue.
[20:19:08] <Jesse_V> s5fs: thanks
[20:19:31] <s5fs> Jesse_V: my guess is that our host is blocking Tor traffic, I also cannot reach their public-facing website from tor haha
[20:19:33] <Jesse_V> I'm the Tor exit operator for 129.123.7.6
[20:19:39] <Jesse_V> there's nothing on my end
[20:19:44] <Jesse_V> yes I suspect that's the case then
[20:19:48] <s5fs> Jesse_V: i figured the block wouldn't be on your end
[20:19:57] <Jesse_V> no, but I'm just letting you know
[20:19:59] <s5fs> Jesse_V: is this a common practice, blocking tor traffic?
[20:20:29] <Jesse_V> no it's not very common. It's usually done by sysadmins who are trigger-happy with the ban-hammer and who have no idea what Tor is
[20:20:39] <Jesse_V> they ban the IP because they think that IP==user
[20:20:43] <Jesse_V> which of course is not the case with Tor
[20:21:13] <s5fs> understood
[20:21:22] <Jesse_V> for example, I've got nearly 2,000 Tor circuits open through my exit, that's a lot of users
[20:21:49] <s5fs> agreed
[20:22:06] <Jesse_V> which means that all of those users cannot load any site that pulls jquery from your site
[20:22:23] <Jesse_V> of course, the Tor Browser disables Javascript by default, but the point still stands
[20:22:45] <s5fs> haha well, i thank you for your concern
[20:23:07] <Jesse_V> not a problem. If you like, I can give you a quick overview of Tor that you can pass on word-for-word
[20:23:25] <s5fs> sure, i'm game
[20:23:32] <s5fs> i only know a little bit about tor and have used it seldom
[20:24:22] <Jesse_V> "As you may be aware based on its DNS lookup (tor-exit-node.cs.usu.edu) the IP in question is a Tor exit node, which means it is a backbone carrier and exit of Tor traffic. Tor is an anonymity protocol on top of TCP and is dedicated to providing privacy to average computer users. It is most often used by people skirting oppressive electronic censorship/surveillance or by those who need Internet privacy for their job or for 
[20:24:23] <Jesse_V> personal reasons. While Tor is not designed for malicious computer users, it is sometimes it is used by them. It would be unfortunate to deny all Tor users access to your site simply because of a few bad apples."
[20:24:34] <s5fs> ah
[20:25:13] <s5fs> my guess is they just have a bunch of blocked IP addresses, and asking to 'unblock tor' probably isn't doable
[20:25:20] <Jesse_V> s5fs: check out torproject.org. I'd recommend that you look at Tor, it's seen a surge in traffic over the last 12 months
[20:25:35] <s5fs> in the past, we've had to send individual IP addresses and traceroutes in order to get addresses unblocked
[20:25:35] <Jesse_V> s5fs: well, I have no idea how their system works, so I can only guess
[20:25:44] <s5fs> same here, just a guess :D
[20:25:51] <Jesse_V> ok, so let's start with the two that I put on Github
[20:26:15] <s5fs> sure, can you give me a traceroute from that IP address to jq01.jquery.com
[20:26:29] <Jesse_V> the bigger solution is to not be so trigger-happy
[20:26:31] <Jesse_V> sure, one sec
[20:26:38] <s5fs> can you confirm that nobody on that network is spamming or performing malicious acts?
[20:27:23] <Jesse_V> I cannot confirm that, but many terabytes of data have passed through that IP over the last several months, and I've only seen a dozen or so reports of issues
[20:27:44] <Jesse_V> Tor gives users freedom, and the vast majority of traffic is innocent, but sometimes there are people who abuse the system
[20:28:07] <s5fs> I understand, but I have to abide by the terms of service of our webhost.
[20:28:33] <s5fs> they require a couple bits of info before they will unblock an IP, including a simple verification that the network is not infected or whatever
[20:29:19] <Jesse_V> I have no control over what comes out of that IP, nor do I filter it. It's a Debian system, it's not infected, etc. The best classification, including one that works legally, is that it's a backbone carrier of Tor traffic, much like the backbone carriers of the Internet
[20:29:32] <Jesse_V> anyway, I have the traceroute, I'll PM it to you
[20:29:38] <s5fs> okay cool
[20:31:15] <s5fs> Jesse_V: weird traceroute, looks like it may not be blocked by our host afterall
[20:31:44] <s5fs> anyways, i'll spin up a trouble ticket and see what they say. i too am curious.
[20:31:47] <Jesse_V> interesting
[20:32:08] <Jesse_V> maybe the NSA intercepted it! haha
[20:32:29] <s5fs> if that's the case, sloppy work ;)
[20:43:49] <s5fs> Jesse_V: okay, ticket has been submitted and I updated the Issue you created on github. once I hear back, I'll update the GH issue.
[20:43:57] <Jesse_V> thanks
[20:45:23] <s5fs> thanks for bringing this to our attention
[20:45:50] <Jesse_V> not a problem, thanks for responding
