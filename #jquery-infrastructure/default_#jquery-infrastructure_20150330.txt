[05:12:58] <bepolite> hello
[05:13:09] <bepolite> Also, I noticed that all the jquery websites have SSL encryption but this is hardly ever used
[05:13:16] <bepolite> I mean when someone types http://jquery.com/ why does he get redirected to https://jquery.com/
[05:13:22] <bepolite> Any specific reason why?
