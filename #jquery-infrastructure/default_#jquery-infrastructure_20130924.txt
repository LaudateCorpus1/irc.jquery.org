[11:06:58] <s5fs> gnarf: okay I cloned that repo, I can just update the md file and push to keep the wiki updated?
[11:07:47] <gnarf> yup
[11:08:03] <s5fs> okay thats sweet
[11:49:42] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: any idea what happened with MT this morning?
[11:49:50] <gnarf> no?
[11:50:04] <ryanneufeld> you didn't get the emergency emails?
[11:50:36] <gnarf> ryanneufeld nope
[11:51:23] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: fwding to you
[11:51:38] <ryanneufeld> ah, looks like scheduled maint
[11:52:59] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: yeah, they emailed last night and gave a huge window of time (9p-1a) for a 10min outage
[11:53:14] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:53:23] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: how many emails did you get?
[11:53:29] <ryanneufeld> lots
[11:53:39] <s5fs> same, haha!
[11:54:03] <s5fs> i only saw one pingdom alert though, for sizzlejs.com
[11:54:53] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:54:59] <ryanneufeld> that was the only one that went down
[11:55:09] <ryanneufeld> I had someone ping on twitter about znc being down
[11:55:13] <ryanneufeld> but clearly it's up
[11:56:19] <s5fs> my irc stuff was kinda wonky this morning as well
[11:56:42] <s5fs> mt paused the machines for a few minutes, so anything network-related would likely get borked up a bit
[11:56:57] <ryanneufeld> yeah
