[13:07:34] * Krinkle :-( at https://blog.jquery.com/2015/09/01/jquery-foundation-and-dojo-foundation-to-merge/
[13:07:38] <Krinkle> no HTTPS for us?
[13:07:50] <Krinkle> the certificate seems functinal
[13:08:06] <Krinkle> CloudFare host err
[16:51:55] <s5fs> Krinkle: good catch
[16:52:07] <s5fs> it doesn't appear that we have ssl enabled for the blog site, which is weird
[16:56:07] <s5fs> I'll look into enabling ssl for this host, and also what cloudflare can do in the meantime for us
[17:14:39] <s5fs> okay, it looks like page rules won't work since the content on the blog site are protocol-specific so it just bombs out
[17:14:49] <s5fs> i'll try to work up a fix in the next evening or so
