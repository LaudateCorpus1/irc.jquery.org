[05:12:54] <arthurvr> I can‚Äôt access bugs.jqueryui.com, the problems of yesterday were fixed right? http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[05:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> arthurvr: It's working for me.
[05:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...well, the first page load worked anyway :-/
[05:28:16] <arthurvr> and for me working now :/ still strange. downforeveryoneorjustme reported that it was down as well.
[05:34:07] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: even though it works fine now it‚Äôs extremely slow for some reason.
[05:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the first page loaded fine (and fast), but then it just spun after that.
[05:36:10] <arthurvr> ‚ÄùThe page you are looking for is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.‚Äù lol
[05:36:22] <arthurvr> don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up but somebody will need to take a look at the server
[05:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's not disk space. We have 25G available.
[05:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> MySQL is using 1000% of the CPU though o_O
[05:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> That seems better.
[05:47:48] <arthurvr> awesome
[05:50:18] <arthurvr> talking about the ui bug tracker somebody really needs to update the copyright year o_O
