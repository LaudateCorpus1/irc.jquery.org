[06:39:53] <mayel> It’s saying the parent cert from AlphaSSL is revoked, see pic here: https://t.co/MPbWV8sazL
[06:50:00] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez agcolom arschmitz anyone here?
[06:54:16] <mayel> I guess most people are still sleeping in the western hemisphere…
[07:01:31] <mayel> I just contacted GlobalSign (the issuer of AlphaSSL’s cert) and they said: We are aware of the issue you described and are in the process of investigating the matter further. 
[07:02:24] <m_gol> mayel: Thanks. I tried to call someone from the infra team in the US but everyone is sleeping
[07:08:47] <mayel> m_gol: Thanks, I figured. I also submited a support ticket directly to AlphaSSL 
[07:09:12] <m_gol> mayel: where are you located?
[07:09:21] <mayel> Greece
[07:09:28] <m_gol> I was able to contact Kris in the US, he's not seeing the problem
[07:09:31] <m_gol> I'm in Poland
[07:10:46] <mayel> They are posting updates here: https://twitter.com/gssystemalerts
[07:12:17] <mayel> Oh it may only be affecting certain regions/ISPs. Are you seeing the problem m_gol?
[07:12:24] <m_gol> yes
[07:12:42] <m_gol> I actually noticed it before I saw seen your message here
[07:13:28] <mayel> Yeah I noticed when a page on apple.com was broken 
[07:13:51] <mayel> The downsides of centralisation…
[07:30:44] <m_gol> mayel: are you behind any VPN?
[07:31:11] <mayel> no
[07:41:16] <m_gol> mayel: someone in the US has also seen it (in Chrome 54 on Sierra)
[07:41:45] <mayel> This issue is affecting many other sites too (see wired.com)

[10:51:13] <mayel> I would recommend jQuery switch to a different SSL cert/provider asap
[10:52:01] <showaz> mayel: +1 AlphaSSL bad global uptime (SLA) for sites.
[10:52:12] <mayel> In the meantime I’ll switch my sites to use https://cdnjs.com
