[10:57:38] <s5fs> meeting today?
[10:58:03] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf danheberden clarkbox scott_gonzalez ^^
[10:58:32] <danheberden> what is a frastructure
[10:58:38] <danheberden> and why do i want to be in it
[10:58:41] <gnarf> i'm super busy
[10:58:43] <s5fs> danheberden: good questions all
[10:58:45] <gnarf> is there anything to talk about?
[10:58:47] <gnarf> cc Krinkle|detached
[10:58:58] <ryanneufeld> I got nada, just checking in
[10:59:04] <ryanneufeld> also silly busy
[10:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> here
[10:59:52] <s5fs> gnarf: my schedule is freeing and i'd like a bit of q&a time when you have time. that's about it.
[11:00:07] <gnarf> s5fs: roger
[11:00:15] <gnarf> hows wiki content going?
[11:00:56] <s5fs> i'm going to bang the plugins top 10 list out in a few days when i get a couple free hours, that's my current target.
[11:01:12] <s5fs> clarkbox: you lurking?
[11:01:18] <clarkbox> yo
[11:01:31] <clarkbox> so it turns out i can't get you that data this week
[11:01:45] <clarkbox> the person responsible for that data here at splunk is swamped, and will be working on it friday
[11:01:47] <s5fs> clarkbox: no worries, i can still mock the page and stuff. where do you want me to land it for your review?
[11:02:20] <clarkbox> on your fork?
[11:03:13] <s5fs> haha okay, i haven't contributed yet so i wanna make sure i'm building good habits
[11:05:06] <s5fs> so i just fork plugins.jquery.com, correct?
[11:09:24] <clarkbox> i think so
[11:09:40] <clarkbox> i have not messed around with the site repo's myself much.
[11:09:48] <clarkbox> gnarf, correct me if i am wrong
[11:10:03] <s5fs> clarkbox: looks like a wp site, not sure forking will get me very far unless there is a script to add content
[11:10:19] <clarkbox> hmm
[11:10:21] <s5fs> in any event i can mock the page and then figure out how to deploy the code, should be a quick hack.
[11:10:29] <clarkbox> ya
[11:10:50] <s5fs> clarkbox: i mean i dunno man, i'm still green as a leaf! i'm trying to get spun into jquery before other things steal my focus.
[11:11:43] <clarkbox> gnarf, whats the best way to go about this? how can we get some JS on the plugin site/pages?
[11:11:44] <s5fs> i'll coodinate with gnarf after i get something working :)
[11:12:19] <clarkbox> ya, he's the brain of this operation ;)
[11:12:23] <s5fs> clarkbox: also thx for the splunk docs, i was not aware it had it's own little search language, that's funky
[11:12:36] <clarkbox> it is funky!
[11:12:38] <s5fs> indeed. i'm just hoping to get up to speed and take some weight off his shoulders
[11:12:38] <clarkbox> ;)
[11:12:50] <s5fs> let his big brain do big brain work, not just happy hands work ;)
[11:13:33] <gnarf> clarkbox s5fs: jquery-wp-content has the templates for plugins.jquery.com
[11:13:48] <gnarf> ask scott_gonzalez for pointing in the right direction for whatever you want to add
[11:14:19] * scott_gonzalez reads up...
[11:14:32] <s5fs> gnarf: will do. what's the best way to get an env up for testing?
[11:14:45] <scott_gonzalez> What are you using splunk data for in the plugins site?
[11:15:07] <clarkbox> wanted to integrate the statistics data into the sute
[11:15:10] <clarkbox> site
[11:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/#installation
[11:15:34] <clarkbox> to get started, just a top plugin chart to replace home pages "new plugins" main column feature
[11:15:38] <clarkbox> ill forward you a mockup
[11:15:51] <clarkbox> who else might be interested/need to know about this plan?
[11:15:54] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i'm new to vagrant, is there a base machine i can yoink down or should i spin up my own vm locally?
[11:16:10] <clarkbox> there is a vagrant how to some place
[11:16:16] <s5fs> awesome!
[11:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: I've never used vagrant.
[11:16:38] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: oh funky, okay. i'll just do as I do, then
[11:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: What stats do we have?
[11:17:29] <clarkbox> back at the hackathon we got a bunch of stuff going on the old plugins site. the person who built it will be transitioning the reports/dashboards over to the new site on friday
[11:17:40] <clarkbox> we have things likeâ€¦ top downloaded/viewed
[11:18:06] <clarkbox> and also things like - people who download plugin X also download Y
[11:18:23] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we have any of that data (other than viewed).
[11:18:46] <clarkbox> you mean, we don't have downloads?
[11:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[11:18:54] <clarkbox> its in apache logs?
[11:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> We don't host any files.
[11:19:04] <clarkbox> ah
[11:19:06] <s5fs> ah
[11:19:08] <clarkbox> ok, well then...
[11:19:29] <s5fs> well i guess it's a top 10 viewed list now ;-)
[11:19:33] <clarkbox> people who VIEW plugin X also view Y
[11:19:44] <clarkbox> also, we can instrument the front end, to log clicks
[11:19:52] <clarkbox> its something I've had on my todo list
[11:20:08] <clarkbox> and then we can get a reasonable idea of actual download clicks
[11:20:16] <s5fs> yeah that would get us much closer
[11:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> Except that's not a great indiciation of use.
[11:20:32] <s5fs> no, but it is an indication of interest
[11:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> It's only an indication of interest for projects that don't have their own sites.
[11:21:03] <s5fs> fair point
[11:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> So the most popular plugins are likely to not be considered the most popular based on our own internal stats.
[11:21:32] <scott_gonzalez> There are better indicators like GitHub stats.
[11:23:30] <s5fs> sure, but is the point of the plugins site to show the global truth about plugins, or just usage stats of the plugins site itself? clearly the former is a harder problem.
[11:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> Well the latter can be extremely misleading.
[11:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/90
[11:25:53] <clarkbox> ok this is great. should have reached out to you sooner scott
[11:27:02] * s5fs reading
[11:28:01] <s5fs> okay, so how do we wish to proceed?
[11:28:35] <clarkbox> someone has to decide what metrics we use
[11:28:41] <clarkbox> scott?
[11:28:48] <s5fs> I get the impression that almost anything we do would be a step forward, so I suggest we start with basics and build out from there.
[11:28:51] <clarkbox> i can get that data into splunk, and we can go from there
[11:29:15] <clarkbox> we can use github
[11:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> We should start with just GitHub numbers.
[11:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> Which are already in WordPress.
[11:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> BUT
[11:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> There's a less controversial issue for you to work on first :-)
[11:30:01] <s5fs> haha, do tell
[11:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/42
[11:31:15] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: okay i can bang that out, can you give me a bit more info? where is the data coming from, and where is it going?
[11:32:53] <s5fs> there's a git commit hook that's doing this now, yes?
[11:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we update it during post receive hooks.
[11:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> But we need a script that just does it on demand for all plugins.
[11:35:35] <scott_gonzalez> We probably want to break it up and do them in chunks.
[11:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> To avoid a) thrashing the server b) hitting the GH limits.
[11:36:03] <scott_gonzalez> The data is stored in sqlite.
[11:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> There's a function specifically for updating this info: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/lib/pluginsdb.js#L113
[11:36:49] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: what the gh limits, rough estimate
[11:37:16] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: ah, perfect, thank you
[11:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> You can see how it's used here: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/lib/hook.js#L175
[11:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> 5k per hour when logged in.
[11:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting
[11:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think gnarf has an infra user that we'll be using.
[11:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> But keep in mind this limit applies to all queries from all scripts that we might write.
[11:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> So we should assume the limit is much lower for this specific script.
[11:38:44] <gnarf> theres a @jquerybot
[11:39:35] <gnarf> but it should be configurable in the config.json yeah?
[11:39:42] <gnarf> so you can test with your own api/no auth
[11:40:03] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:40:17] <s5fs> what's @jquerybot?
[11:41:35] <scott_gonzalez> A GitHub user that we use for infrastrucure tasks.
[11:41:56] <scott_gonzalez> So when you write this script, pull the user and password from config.json
[11:41:58] <s5fs> okay so not the twitter acct haha
[11:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, don't use username + password, use an auth token.
[11:42:10] <s5fs> right
[11:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> Now that they finally made those usable again :-)
[11:42:53] <s5fs> whee!
[11:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> Also, don't require config.json directly, use require( "../lib/config" )
[11:43:41] <s5fs> okay, no problem
[11:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> If you've got any questions, just ping me.
[11:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you'll probably want this to populate your database: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/9aefc71e3e06da400911
[11:45:15] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: haha that was my next question
[11:47:28] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: thanks, i'll certainly ping you if i get stuck
[12:38:41] <gnarf> s5fs: one of these days, I want to put a Vagrantfile in jquery-wp-content to make this easier
