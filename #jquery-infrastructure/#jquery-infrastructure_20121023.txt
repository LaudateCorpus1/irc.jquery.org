[14:46:51] <ryanneufeld> what was that command you showed me to fix slow terminals
[14:46:52] <ryanneufeld> ?
[14:47:23] <Krinkle>  :)
[14:47:27] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: let me pull it up
[14:47:32] <ryanneufeld> Thanks buddy

[15:14:31] <gnarf> b-ot: tell clarkbox Want to ask you about splunk covering an "alarm in IRC" use case
[15:14:31] <b-ot> gnarf, I’ll tell clarkbox about that.
[15:22:09] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you get my pm?
[17:16:09] <Krinkle> b-ot: tell clarkbox Regarding your offer to check out splunk at Wikimedia, I'm interested to see how "IRC notifications" would work as well.
[17:16:09] <b-ot> Krinkle, I’ll tell clarkbox about that.
[17:16:19] <Krinkle> :D

[17:58:14] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: gnarf: redirect fixed
[17:58:47] <jzaefferer> thanks Krinkle
[20:39:15] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: can you explain what the @ means for @ssh_user
[21:08:19] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: virtual
[21:08:25] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: must be "realize"d
[21:08:30] <ryanneufeld> mhmm
[21:08:44] <ryanneufeld> so... why are they virtual?
[21:08:54] <gnarf> multiple things can realize the same virtual
[21:09:05] <gnarf> also then we can define them in the same module
[21:09:12] <gnarf> and only load the users we need per server
[21:09:22] <gnarf> if it will always be the same for all servers, non-virtual makes sense
[21:09:40] <ryanneufeld> oic
[21:09:43] <gnarf> virtual lets you define everyone, and only realize the ones you care about in the config
[21:09:54] <ryanneufeld> ahhh
[21:10:07] <gnarf> also, multiple things can realize the same virtual
[21:10:20] <gnarf> so its good for a resource like a "package" to do sometimes
[21:10:31] <gnarf> honestly
[21:10:44] <gnarf> the virtual users thing is just the like standard puppet pattern for users
[21:10:47] <gnarf> define em all
[21:10:49] <gnarf> realize em
[21:11:10] <gnarf> kinda seems to be its best use case
[21:13:12] <ryanneufeld> yeah
