[01:14:21] <jzaefferer> gnarf: what's the difference between these two? code.origin.jquery.com:/var/www/code.origin.jquery.com/htdocs/ and swarm.jquery.org:/var/www/html/code.jquery.com/
[01:15:07] <jzaefferer> gnarf: are they the same? which one is actually relevant? why does it look like copying stuff to either works?
[08:35:40] <gnarf> symlink jzaefferer
[08:36:03] <gnarf> code.origin is the real one
[11:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: bugs.jqueryui.com -> 404
[12:09:53] <gnarf> not for me?
