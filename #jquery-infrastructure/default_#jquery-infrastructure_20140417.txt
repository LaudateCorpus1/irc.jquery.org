[12:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> who's around?
[12:49:35] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: hi
[12:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: Can you point globalizejs.com at our web server?
[12:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> Same as other sites on jquery-wp-content.
[12:50:00] <s5fs> sure, jq01? (jquery.com)
[12:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:50:25] <s5fs> sure 1sec
[12:53:41] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: did you register the domain and point it at our nameservers?
[12:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers registered it. https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/261#issuecomment-40739244
[12:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if he setup the name servers.
[12:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I'm guessing he didn't. Since it resolves to a different IP.
[13:00:19] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: okay i think it's set up correctly, once Kris updates the namecheap records we should be good
[13:00:28] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:00:32] <s5fs> I updated the ticket as well
[13:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> Do you not have access to our namecheap account?
[13:01:17] <s5fs> i don't believe so
[13:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^ Let's fix that :-)
[13:03:39] <s5fs> gnarf: I also have very little info in dropbox, is that correct? I'm home with a cold and should be free all day, ping me if you wanna do a hangout or whatever
[13:04:44] <ryanneufeld> I appears I also don't have access to namecheap
[13:06:39] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: after the "pen island" fiasco, who can blame them?
