[11:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around?
[11:53:02] <gnarf> yes
[11:53:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not for much longer
[11:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to edit the footer on bugs.jquery.com.
[11:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> I can't remember what file to edit.
[11:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> I found /var/www/bugs.jquery.com/private/templates/site.html, but that's super outdated and not being used.
[12:03:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: wish i knew
[12:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> Crap. I've done this before.
[12:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> Did I break bugs.jquery.com?
[12:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, no, it's just being super slow again.
[12:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...is this on jq05?
[12:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> Or am I playing around with a bogus copy?
[12:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like things changed since the last time I did anything with Trac.
[12:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> I think I broke something.
[12:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> HELP
[12:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> OK, important info: Trac requires XHTML.
[12:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> <br> will make the entire site crash.
[12:26:05] <arschmitz> yikes!
[12:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that was fine.
[12:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> s/fine/fun/
[13:00:04] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: haha, sounds like you're having a fun day
