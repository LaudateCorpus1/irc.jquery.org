[07:00:05] <DaveMethvin> anybody around to reboot the bugs.jquery.com server?
[07:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: done
[07:16:15] <DaveMethvin> thanks scott_gonzalez!
[07:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm....
[07:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem to be doing too well.
[07:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it should be better now.
[07:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: "This tracker is for only for"
[07:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> "make sure this is right place "
[07:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> "an web site issue"
[07:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> You linked to dev.jqueryui.com instead of bugs.jqueryui.com
[07:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> How to Report Bugs should ink to http://contribute.jquery.org/bug-reports/ instead of docs.jquery.com
[07:21:10] <DaveMethvin> thanks ... it's been like that for more than a year i guess?
[07:21:17] <DaveMethvin> those aren't recent changes
[07:23:41] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/wiki/TicketGuidelines/NewTicketSummary?action=diff&version=13&old_version=12
[07:24:56] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/wiki/TicketGuidelines/NewTicketSummary?action=diff&version=9&old_version=8
[08:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I guess you just made a change to actually show that page
[13:05:09] <s5fs> DaveMethvin: what, couldn't wait for xmas day proper? haha!
[13:05:47] <DaveMethvin> santa should bring us a new server s5fs!
[13:05:59] <DaveMethvin> and a pony.
[13:06:06] <s5fs> the pony is long overdue
[13:07:06] <s5fs> anyways, I'm expecting a pretty skeleton crew for the next couple of days, but I'm home for the holidays (my family is all here in portland) so please call me directly if there are critical issues. i welcome the distraction ;)
