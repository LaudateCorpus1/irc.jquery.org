[06:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: How do we see stats for the CDN?
[06:27:21] <gnarf> like usage stats?
[06:27:39] <gnarf> login at https://cp.maxcdn.com/dashboard
[06:27:51] <gnarf> you have an account
[06:28:00] <gnarf> your gmail
[06:48:23] <gnarf> your gmail
[07:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[07:47:25] <scott_gonzalez> So if a file doesn't show up in the URI filter autocomplete for the raw logs, does that mean there are just no requests for it?
[07:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this defaults to just one hour for raw logs.
