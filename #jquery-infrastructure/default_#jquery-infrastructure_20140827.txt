[14:47:04] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 149aeb1fd 15JoÌˆrn Zaefferer: qunitjs.com: Redirect from QUnit.jsDump.parse to QUnit.dump.parse
[14:50:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf s5fs: Looking for support in testing a change. This commit introduces a redirect: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/9aeb1fd49f4f795053fd4ad1acca45644620e625
[14:51:22] <jzaefferer> I connected via "ssh jq01.stage.jquery.com" and ran "sudo puppet agent --test" to get it deployed
[14:51:39] <jzaefferer> Afterwards its still not redirecting: http://stage.api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.jsDump.parse/
[14:52:19] <jzaefferer> The change itself is pretty trivial, so I suspect its just not deployed. Am I connecting to the wrong machine?
[15:26:45] <s5fs> jzaefferer: i'm traveling right now but will take a look when I get to my destination, so maybe 1-2 hours from now.
[15:31:49] <jzaefferer> s5fs: okay, thanks. I still need to push the site change live, that renames the page, that should go together with deploying the redirect
[15:32:08] <jzaefferer> s5fs: if the instructions in the readme are wrong, an update of that would be great
[19:04:30] <jzaefferer> s5fs: did you get a chance to look at my issue?
