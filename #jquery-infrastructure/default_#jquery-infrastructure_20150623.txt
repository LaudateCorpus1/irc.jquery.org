[10:50:07] <Krinkle> m_gol: Okay, so I'll just merge the ua-parser branch in testswarm and add the icon and then block on #330 for deploymet
[10:50:32] <m_gol> Krinkle: thanks :)
[10:52:43] <m_gol> Krinkle: should I find a smaller icon? (or just modify the attached one)
[10:55:15] <Krinkle> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Microsoft_Edge_logo.svg/130px-Microsoft_Edge_logo.svg.png
[10:55:17] <Krinkle> I've got it
[10:56:00] <m_gol> ok :)
[11:02:44] <Krinkle> m_gol: Looks like that ua-parser version is not released, and while uap-php uses unreleased git versions, it too has not been updated yet to inlude edge
[11:02:55] <Krinkle> It's specified as IE12
[11:03:47] <Krinkle> which is good enough for now I suppose
[11:03:50] <Krinkle> at least it works
[11:06:03] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15Krinkle closed issue #329: Add the Edge icon/class to TestSwarm 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/329
[11:06:04] <m_gol> Krinkle: what ua-parser?
[11:06:27] <Krinkle> m_gol: uap-core latest master has the Edge change
[11:06:54] <Krinkle> m_gol: That lib has not made a minor release for it yet, and uap-php also hasn't updated their submodule yet nor made a release.
[11:07:02] <m_gol> I see
[11:07:30] <m_gol> there hasn't been a uap-core tag for a long time...
[11:07:58] <m_gol> so I guess they don't pay attention to module versions?
[11:08:13] <Krinkle> m_gol: uap-php just points to raw git commits
[11:08:19] <Krinkle> but they haven't updated it yet this month
[11:08:22] <m_gol> yup, that seems to be the pattern
[11:09:33] <m_gol> last update was in February
[11:46:57] <Krinkle> m_gol: lol, TestSwarm's home page used to be called Tinder
[11:47:04] <Krinkle> John's invention.
[11:47:13] <Krinkle> Amazing how perception of words can change

[12:10:08] <Krinkle> m_gol: Do you have admin powers to enable Travis Ci for the testswarm repo?

[12:58:30] <m_gol> Krinkle: I don't, DaveMethvin|away & scott_gonzalez should have
