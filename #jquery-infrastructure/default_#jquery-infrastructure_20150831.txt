[09:06:14] <markelog> i get it, my head is spinning also )
[09:06:27] <markelog> nope, was waiting
[09:26:05] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: did you ever hear back about api.jquery.com being down?
[09:26:22] <m_gol> ryanneuufeld: nope
[09:26:28] <ryanneufeld> it looks like its back up, and i know that there was some planned emergency maintenance going on
[09:26:32] <m_gol> ah, ok
[09:26:38] <ryanneufeld> which is likely the cause of the downtime
[09:26:39] <m_gol> what should I do in such a case? :)
[09:26:56] <ryanneufeld> what you did for a start
[09:27:13] <ryanneufeld> but you could ping @s5fs_ directly as well
[09:54:52] <gnarf> m_gol: poke people - investigate - reboot shit if you need to and noone is around
[09:55:40] <gnarf> m_gol: try to ssh to the box too (look at the infra wiki for the DNS AXFR report to see which box it's on) -- check status on digital ocean's interface
[10:01:47] <m_gol> gnarf: thanks, I'll read those things when I have time so that I can be more useful next time :)
