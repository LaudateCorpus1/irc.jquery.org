[12:31:45] <clarkbox> gnarf
[12:31:51] <clarkbox> splunk.jquery.com is down
[12:32:15] <clarkbox> hardware is not in the internets
[13:49:22] <s5fs> clarkbox: what does that mean?
[14:19:34] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: it means the box isn
[14:19:38] <ryanneufeld> *isn't available
[14:20:45] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: haha, I mean I know the box isn't reachable, but I don't know the real hostname. does this mean the machine was removed from MT or just inaccessible?
[14:21:23] <s5fs> If I can help, I'm happy to. Still learning where things live, etc.
[14:37:36] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: what's odd about that, is that I don't see splunk in the DNS either
[14:38:26] <ryanneufeld> nvm I see it now
[14:41:59] <clarkbox> hsotname is splunk.jquery.com… you have credentials for it. indexing could be/is probably down
[14:42:11] <clarkbox> s5fs ^
[14:42:24] <clarkbox> ryanneufeld. what to do? want me to email MT support?
[14:42:44] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: well, the thing is, I don't even know that IP
[14:43:14] <clarkbox> i have 64.13.216.131
[14:43:39] <clarkbox> its on the new arch...
[14:43:45] <gnarf> clarkbox: pretty sure that it might be maintenence window today
[14:43:48] <clarkbox> helix or whatever
[14:44:00] <clarkbox> bah… its a pretty big window. id call it a garage door.
[14:45:08] <ryanneufeld> I don't have access to the new arch do I gnarf?
[14:45:55] <gnarf> im on the helix
[14:46:04] <clarkbox> what the helix saying?
[14:46:11] <gnarf> both machines were down - booting them now
[14:46:16] <clarkbox> sweet
[14:46:19] <clarkbox> thanks
[14:46:20] <gnarf> i think they took it down for support and didn't restart them
[14:46:38] <clarkbox> both? what else runs on helix?
[14:49:36] <clarkbox> its back. thanks corey.
[14:50:25] <gnarf> new jenkins machine
[14:58:50] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: any plans to show us around helix when we're in Portlandia?
[14:59:45] <gnarf> yes
[14:59:55] <ryanneufeld> nice
[15:00:13] <ryanneufeld> I'm driving down this time. Should be a nice drive
[15:00:20] <ryanneufeld> hopefully I get my car fixed before I go
[15:55:13] <s5fs> gnarf: awesome, thanks for handling that
