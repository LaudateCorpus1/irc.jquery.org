[13:11:57] <s5fs> gnarf: i patched some machines last night, but held back on a couple
[13:12:10] <s5fs> for instance, on jq02.stage i did not upgrade imagemagick
[13:12:21] <s5fs> on jq03.stage it wanted to upgrade jenkins, is that correct? should I push that through?
[13:12:36] <s5fs> i also did all eol boxes and will get the other systems tonight (probably)
[17:13:00] <gnarf> jenkins should be okay
[17:13:01] <gnarf> but imagemagick i think we wsill need to stay version locked
[17:13:03] <gnarf> cc rxaviers at some point and ask?
[19:32:51] <s5fs> gnarf: will do, thanks
[21:40:48] <s5fs> gnarf: okay all remaining hosts have been patched
[21:41:02] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: see above, in case i broke something
[21:41:25] <s5fs> everyone else, call me if stuff is broken thanks!
