[12:36:45] <m_gol> I wanted to create a new Jenkins project but all I get is Java exceptions...
[12:37:34] <m_gol> java.io.IOException: Failed to create a temporary file in /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/MY_PROJECT_NAME
[12:41:34] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15mzgol opened issue #333: Exception when trying to create a new Jenkins project 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/333
[12:45:50] <m_gol> ok, I can modify absolutely nothing on Jenkins without it blowing up completely (cc gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs, anyone knows sth about it?)
[12:50:38] <gnarf> m_gol full disk - looking for whats big
[12:56:04] <gnarf> did someone turn up the log level or something?
[13:00:37] <m_gol> gnarf: no idea
[13:00:44] <m_gol> I didn't :P
[13:02:44] <gnarf> m_gol try now?
[13:03:34] <gnarf> we are like still almost out of disk here
[13:03:41] <gnarf> I'm not sure whats safe to delete
[13:04:02] <gnarf> Krinkle / jzaefferer - can one of you look at jenkins' drive space and find some stuff to delete?
[13:04:14] <m_gol> gnarf: works now, thanks!
[13:04:54] <m_gol> gnarf: another day to dump TestSwarm logs perhaps? Krinkle said they take a lot of space so project history needs to be cleaned up from time to time
[13:06:56] <gnarf> nevermind about that space
[13:07:01] <gnarf> something exploded in the jenkins.log
[13:07:03] <gnarf> it was like 22gig
[13:07:12] <gnarf> i rm'ed it because i had to
[13:07:15] <gnarf> but we should monitor

[13:35:37] <Krinkle> gnarf: m_gol: Yeah, TestSwarm DB is huge and growing, but that's on a separate server now
[13:35:56] <Krinkle> gnarf: Thanks :)
[13:36:22] <Krinkle> gnarf: Do we have some kind of monitoring system (e.g. cpu usage, disk space) that produces trends graphs and alerts for thresholds?
[13:36:39] <Krinkle> Even without personal notifications, having it pump to IRC would be interesting as well
[13:36:42] <gnarf> Krinkle: newrelic is monitoring
[13:37:04] <Krinkle> that's what Wikimedia does for the warning threshold (and the error one pages on-duty infra persons)
[18:05:11] <gnarf> s5fs: is your laptop muted?
[18:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you start the call?

[21:38:37] <s5fs> Just a friendly note that jenkins has been patched, so if you see any weirdness, give a shout. Thanks!
