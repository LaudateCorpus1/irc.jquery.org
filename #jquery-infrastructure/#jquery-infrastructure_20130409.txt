[13:00:24] <clarkbox> hey - i am back!
[13:03:06] <clarkbox> gnarl, i assume you have the proper splunk related puppet config in place? that should be all
[13:03:11] <clarkbox> *gnarf
[13:03:30] <clarkbox> i can have a look
[13:04:32] <gnarf> clarkbox: yeah, it should have forwarder
[13:04:51] <clarkbox> oh, ya… there is a wiki entry for this
[13:04:55] <clarkbox> ill take care of it
[13:05:16] <clarkbox> next step is to go on splunk master, and configure the sources (aka logs) you want from that server
[14:04:11] <clarkbox> hey gnarf, looks to be a firewall issue
[14:04:23] <clarkbox> can't telnet to splunk machine from the new one
[14:04:31] <clarkbox> 8089
[14:05:14] <gnarf> ssh?
[14:05:16] <gnarf> oh
[14:05:20] <gnarf> can you ping/ssh it?
[14:05:41] <clarkbox> hmm, can't ping it even
[14:05:57] <clarkbox> it does resolve...
[14:06:08] <clarkbox> 64.13.216.131
[14:06:54] <clarkbox> and ssh is open
[14:08:39] <clarkbox> nope… sorry wrong port
[14:08:44] <clarkbox> my fault
