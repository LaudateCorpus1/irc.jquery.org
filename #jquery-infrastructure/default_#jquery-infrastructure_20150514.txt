[04:05:05] <m_gol> s5fs: I'm afraid the recent update & reboot broke jQuery Core tests :/
[04:05:17] <m_gol> see http://swarm.jquery.org/job/552 & http://swarm.jquery.org/job/551
[04:05:51] <m_gol> s5fs: I restarted those 3 suites on Chrome 41 in an older build that succeeded before & they failed again so it's an infra issue: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/550
[04:07:39] <m_gol> s5fs: all those failures are ajax/PHP-related
[14:47:43] <s5fs> m_gol: when would you be available for a hangout to assist with this? I'll review the logs and fix anything obvious, but if I get stuck, I may need your assistance since you know how to test the app better than I.
[14:53:00] <s5fs> additionally, it appears that the Core test are running successfully, per the jenkins logs. so maybe it's a notification problem?
[15:16:24] <s5fs> jzaefferer: would you be available to help troubleshoot this with me? i know you have far more experience and i'm happy to ask silly questions.
