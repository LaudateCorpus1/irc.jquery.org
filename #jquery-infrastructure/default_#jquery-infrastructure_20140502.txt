[05:21:43] <DaveMethvin> gnarf s5fs I did an update on jquery.com a few minutes ago but it hasn't shown up ... is there a way to see what's going on?
[08:38:38] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: what kind of update?
[08:39:34] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/commits/master 
[08:39:41] <DaveMethvin> normally a tag and push shoudl update the site
[08:56:05] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I don't have access to the listeners
[08:56:19] <ryanneufeld> can you tell me what post commit hooks are configured in github?
[08:56:23] <ryanneufeld> cc scott_gonzalez
[09:00:18] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I found a problem
[09:00:31] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: https://gist.github.com/9957bd5238b24be41a36 
[09:00:47] <ryanneufeld> cc scott_gonzalez ajpiano s5fs gnarf ^^
[09:07:22] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:07:31] <DaveMethvin> okay let me check what I edited again
[09:08:34] <ryanneufeld> @DaveMethvin are you using the vagrant env for testing?
[09:08:54] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: nope ... had some problems with it
[09:09:01] <DaveMethvin> it's been a while so don't ask me what
[09:09:42] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea what build-member-list is
[09:09:56] <DaveMethvin> lemme look at the gruntfile
[09:10:48] <DaveMethvin> whoa, grunt 0.3
[09:10:55] <DaveMethvin> i didn't even know we had sites using that anymore
[09:13:44] <DaveMethvin> okay, this is some member list processing unrelated to my commit
[09:14:19] <DaveMethvin> but since grunt has no dependency tree it's brute-force building everything and won't let this get updated until this unrelated thing is fixed
[09:15:12] <ryanneufeld> ah
[09:17:38] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I'm trying a local grunt deploy --force now
[09:17:59] <DaveMethvin> a daring young man, you are
[09:18:09] <ryanneufeld> to the vagrant box ;)
[09:18:11] <DaveMethvin> i thought about removing that task in the grunt.js for now
[09:18:12] <ryanneufeld> at least if that works
[09:19:17] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: i got that same error in my local vagrant trying to deploy jquery.com
[09:19:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[09:19:52] <arschmitz> but with apache and mysql it was fine
[09:22:54] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I got a local push working with --force
[09:23:37] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6xmbl5mpvvqws7s/Screenshot%202014-05-02%2009.23.30.png does that look right?
[09:23:39] <DaveMethvin> i just wonder what happened to those pages that were supposed to be built, did the old ones just stay then?
[09:23:48] <ryanneufeld> I dunno
[09:23:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah that part looks correct
[09:23:57] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna investigate
[09:27:46] <ryanneufeld> so, it looks like that task is making a ajax call to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jquery/jquery.org/master/data/members/gold.json
[09:27:54] <ryanneufeld> for the various member levels
[09:33:31] <ryanneufeld> HAHA
[09:33:35] <ryanneufeld> found it
[09:37:09] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/68
[09:37:14] <ryanneufeld> I have a PR coming.
[09:37:41] <DaveMethvin> oh i noticed it was doing that but thought http would follow the redirect
[09:37:48] <DaveMethvin> i guess it doesn't!
[09:38:05] <DaveMethvin> awesome, thanks ryanneufeld 
[09:39:00] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it should follow redirects, but oh well
[09:39:02] <ryanneufeld> easy fix
[09:41:27] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/pull/69
[09:41:46] <DaveMethvin> so did that fix it?
[09:41:55] <DaveMethvin> when you tried locally?
[09:42:09] <ryanneufeld> yes
[09:42:19] <ryanneufeld> the problem was that it wasn't following redirect
[09:42:25] <ryanneufeld> when I changed the URL
[09:42:30] <ryanneufeld> it worked perfectly
[09:42:56] <ryanneufeld> and my local testing supports that
[09:43:16] <ryanneufeld> on a side note, I'd love to help you resolve any issues you're having with the vagrant envirionment
[09:43:42] <ryanneufeld> I know there was an issue with 64bit machines on windows computers that don't have VT enabled in the BIOS
[09:43:56] <ryanneufeld> but I thought we solved that with a 32bit VM (slower, but more compatable)
[09:44:10] <ryanneufeld> in fact arschmitz was helping me with that ;)
[09:44:22] <arschmitz> oh yeah forgot all about that
[09:44:46] <ryanneufeld> I didn't :p
[09:44:56] <arschmitz> i assume your waiting on me to try something then ?
[09:46:24] <ryanneufeld> what, no
[09:46:41] <ryanneufeld> just grateful for the assist
[09:47:11] <arschmitz> oh ok
[09:47:25] <arschmitz> well i actually have that pc a lot more convienent now if you need anything
[09:47:58] <ryanneufeld> Good to know :)
[09:55:14] <DaveMethvin> i just need to go thru the whole process front to back again to be sure it's all working
[09:55:30] <DaveMethvin> i have another debian vm i'm using to deploy core releases since Windows can't do it
[09:55:53] <DaveMethvin> npm creates paths that are too deep (>260 chars) which causes npm install to die
[10:00:49] <ryanneufeld> oh
[10:01:04] <ryanneufeld> jebus windows
[10:01:10] <ryanneufeld> y u so fail
[10:01:10] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: (屮'Д')屮
[10:08:00] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: is your problem solved in production now?
[10:08:09] <ryanneufeld> looks like it is
[10:08:19] <DaveMethvin> yes!
[10:08:30] <DaveMethvin> awesome
[10:08:37] <DaveMethvin> i bet we have this problem in other repos
[10:08:55] <DaveMethvin> since they just made this change last week
[10:09:46] <ryanneufeld> probably
[10:09:54] <ryanneufeld> but at least now we know what it is
[12:13:13] <gseguin> gnarf, ryanneufeld: ping
[12:13:19] <ryanneufeld> hola
[12:13:38] <gseguin> hey ryanneufeld, is there a plan to fix the certificate on the znc server?
[12:13:55] <ryanneufeld> I wasn't aware it was broken
[12:14:11] <s5fs> gseguin: i guess not, haha!
[12:14:19] <gseguin> lol
[12:14:37] <gseguin> let me see the error I get
[12:14:47] <ryanneufeld> it's a self signed cert
[12:15:04] <s5fs> is that the error then? or has it expired?
[12:19:57] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: ok nevermind, RTFM is the answer to my question
[12:20:17] <gseguin> yeah it's self-signed
[12:20:29] <gseguin> I just needed to tell textual to trust it
[12:20:40] <s5fs> gseguin: okay good deal. will you accept this personal check, too?
[12:20:48] <s5fs> post-dated of course
[12:20:55] <gseguin> sure, do you want cash in exchange ?
[12:21:09] <gseguin> :D
[12:21:12] <s5fs> dogecoin only
[12:21:38] <s5fs> if you're stateside i'll accept payment in mercury dimes (the most beautiful american coinage!)
[12:21:51] <gseguin> heh :)
[12:38:50] <gnarf> we could put one of the real certs on znc
[12:39:32] <gseguin> gnarf: that would work too
[12:40:15] <s5fs> gnarf: speaking of, do you have access to push the certs along? kris is unavailable.
[12:43:51] <gnarf> s5fs: oh man - today is like the one day this week I'm actually writing code
[12:44:09] <gnarf> and also need to get ready for a plane, a train, and a conference next monday :)
[12:44:18] <gnarf> but i'll see if i can find some time to do that today
[12:44:24] <gnarf> if not maybe tomorrow
[12:44:37] <s5fs> gnarf: its not critical, don't stress it. if you could talk to kris and negotiate me access i can do the rest haha!
