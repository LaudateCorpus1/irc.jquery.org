[05:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: OMG, working MediaWiki + keyboard shortcuts = SO FAST
[05:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: Is there a cron deleting sessions
[05:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> Every once in a while it yells at me about my session.
[05:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> But the weird thing is that I don't need to log in again, I can just refresh the page.
[06:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> This is happening more and more frequently.
[07:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...navigation is fine, it's just trying to save a page that isn't working.
[09:25:50] <Krinkle_> scott_gonzalez: Probably a bug in PHP rather than MediaWiki, but I'm feeling like spending more time on it isn't worth it.
[09:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if I can't save pages, I can't do any more redirects.
[09:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...it worked that time, just took a while.
[09:37:40] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Indeed, takes a long time for me as well. I'll enable profiling and see what's up.
[09:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:38:18] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry that this is causing you so much trouble.
[09:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> All of this jus to kill it off...
[09:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still gettings lots of "Sorry! We could not process your edit due to a loss of session data."
[09:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the two problems are related.
[09:39:32] <Krinkle> Yes
[09:43:56] <Krinkle> fyi, I'm looking at http://docs.jquery.com/mw/profileinfo.php (usually empty, enabled now)
[09:44:18] <Krinkle> nothing out of the ordinary from what I can see
[09:44:28] <Krinkle> Looks like PHP is dropping sessions.
[09:44:35] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Perhaps something with your cookies?
[09:44:43] <Krinkle> Try logging out for real and logging back in
[09:44:59] <Krinkle> The slowness is odd.
[09:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:45:17] <Krinkle> Doesn't jump out in the graph, possibly Apache being slow with POST requests in general
[09:45:28] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: is "Show preview" also significantly slower?
[09:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check.
[09:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> I just got a 500.
[09:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> Now everything is slow /o\
[09:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? http://cl.ly/image/2R3y3F0s0e1r
[10:29:21] <s5fs_> good morning
[10:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> Hey s5fs_.
[10:31:46] <s5fs> hi
[10:31:53] <s5fs> whats up with docs?
[10:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's all busted.
[10:33:03] <s5fs> man, no kidding
[10:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> I had a few minutes of blissful editing this morning.
[10:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> And now it's all fucked.
[10:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> session problems, 500s, super long load times, etc.
[10:33:24] <s5fs> haha! well that's no good
[10:33:38] <s5fs> yeah it's not loading for me either, and i'm a nice guy
[10:34:50] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: do you still have access? i can't seem to ssh in right now.
[10:35:20] <s5fs> i've got a meeting in 30min
[10:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't even tried SSHing in.
[11:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how this happens: http://cl.ly/image/1X2v1n1m0e44
[11:12:37] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: yeah that's bizarre
[11:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> Probably doesn't help that http://static.jquery.com/files/rocker/scripts/custom.js?303 is being loaded twice.
[11:14:06] <s5fs> i'm not seeing the dropshadow issue, but page loads are taking just shy of forever
[11:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> >A database query syntax error has occurred.
[11:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> This may indicate a bug in the software.
[11:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> The last attempted database query was:
[11:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> <blockquote><code>(SQL query hidden)</code></blockquote>
[11:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> from within function "<code>JobQueueDB::claimRandom</code>".
[11:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> Database returned error "<samp>1205: Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction (localhost)
[11:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> The drop shadow issue is very sporadic.
[11:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> But it's also a client-side issue.
[11:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> The shadow class is added via script.
[11:14:45] <s5fs> can you ssh into the host? i'm getting ssh_exchange_indentification errors
[11:16:41] <s5fs> wow, 2.5min to load the page
[11:17:04] <scott_gonzalez> Same here.
[11:17:23] <s5fs> dropshadows look fine, at least by 2002 standards
[11:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[11:18:03] <s5fs> man I thought krinkle had this issue resolved yesterday, it all looked so promising!
[11:19:00] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Can you reproduce the db lock? Or just the once?
[11:19:50] <Krinkle> I can't connect to eol3 for some reason
[11:19:51] <Krinkle> ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host 
[11:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> It happened a few times.
[11:19:55] <Krinkle> wtf?
[11:20:13] <s5fs> Krinkle: same!
[11:20:19] <Krinkle> worked yesterday
[11:20:24] <s5fs> Krinkle: same.
[11:20:46] <s5fs> i'm not happy about the loss of ssh
[11:20:47] <Krinkle> gnarf: ryanneufeld: Can you see if this machine needs operational fixing? I'm not sure what to do from the outside
[11:21:04] <Krinkle> I suppose some kind of MediaTemple thing exists to fix or inspect this
[11:21:19] <s5fs> I'd assume a vm console or something, yeah?
[11:21:25] <s5fs> linode has one
[11:23:23] <s5fs> i'm sorry its taking me so long to come up to speed gang. i'm giving a talk at nodepdx on thursday, first one, so i'm nervous and investing all my spare cycles on that project. now that shit is broken i'm kinda wishing i'd have spent more time ramping up with gnarf.
[11:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Actually, I got that error yesterday too.
[11:24:32] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Yes, I remember.
[11:24:33] <Krinkle> s5fs: I have fairly wide shell access since I help with various things, but when it comes to more complex puppet or vm stuff, its out of my league.
[11:24:56] <Krinkle> (and outside my job description I suppose :P)
[11:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: This is out of my league as well. At least you've been able to help to some extent.
[11:25:24] <s5fs> Krinkle: same, but my current learning track is puppet and stuff. my job description is "get shit done" with a side of "become a js expert" haha
[11:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> All I've been doing is whining about it :-P
[11:25:28] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Software side yeah :)
[11:25:45] <Krinkle> s5fs: So you're a jquery foundatoin contractor for operations?
[11:25:51] <s5fs> volunteer
[11:25:55] <Krinkle> (I haven't kept up with announcements, sorry if I missed it)
[11:26:04] <Krinkle> s5fs: cool
[11:26:17] <Krinkle> very cool indeed
[11:26:54] <Krinkle> s5fs: Mind if I ask your background (how you got here). Pretty exciting to have more volunteers in infrastructure, we don't have that many iirc.
[11:26:58] <s5fs> i've been consulting professionally for the last few years, lots of varied systems and programming gigs. past couple years have been mainly supporting energy conservation non-profits and a bit of defense contracting.
[11:27:27] <Krinkle> nice
[11:27:39] <gnarf> s5fs: pokemedia.com yeah?
[11:27:45] <s5fs> gnarf: yeah
[11:27:48] <gnarf> adding you to (mt) account center
[11:27:55] <s5fs> gnarf: thanks man
[11:28:04] <s5fs> gnarf: mind PMing me the link?
[11:32:29] <gnarf> s5fs: so i tried to get in with the remote tools, but I can't --- we might need to open a support ticket with (mt)
[11:32:31] <gnarf> can you do that?
[11:33:34] <gnarf> If you don't have time for it, I'll do it
[11:35:55] <Krinkle> gnarf: Perhaps you can restart it?
[11:36:08] <Krinkle> I imagine it just got loaded up with unknown shit
[11:36:21] <Krinkle> OOM perhaps even
[11:36:41] <gnarf> Krinkle: initiating reboot
[11:36:45] <Krinkle> gnarf: is this one of those VMs without virtual/scratch memory
[11:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, Krinkle: That loss of session data might be from the lock.
[11:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> The lock message is on the page, but hidden.
[11:37:04] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: yeah, if it can't query the database, the session can't be found.
[11:37:05] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah, no swap
[11:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa, it's actually rendering multiple pages.
[11:37:19] <Krinkle> gnarf: php accel is enabled there
[11:37:29] <Krinkle> I imagine that is using swap?
[11:37:34] <gnarf> Krinkle: there is 0 swap
[11:37:37] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/3G2i3o473m18
[11:37:39] <gnarf> if you have to swap
[11:37:41] <Krinkle> though that has been enabled there for a while
[11:37:43] <gnarf> random proccesses die
[11:38:08] <Krinkle> yeah
[11:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> So that probably explains the crazy shadow as well.
[11:38:24] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: How so?
[11:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> The shadow is added via script.
[11:38:48] <gnarf> Krinkle: i can't even reboot the server, the init script can't run
[11:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> The script is probably running multiple times because of multiple "pages" being rendered.
[11:39:18] <gnarf> Krinkle: before we go doing things that eat the ram, check "free"? :)
[11:39:38] <Krinkle> gnarf: what do you mean?
[11:39:48] <Krinkle> I'm not on the machine, I can't ssh.
[11:40:07] <gnarf> well, we made some change recently that increased memory usage 
[11:40:35] <gnarf> some time yesterday probably? http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=be96be4ba2defeff&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10060&graphid=436
[11:40:45] <gnarf> whatever it was killed the zabbix monitoring agent 
[11:40:45] <gnarf> :)
[11:43:50] <gnarf> Krinkle / scott_gonzalez / s5fs: REQUEST ID #2316593 / STATUS: NEW -- (mt) ticket asking them to reboot eol3
[11:43:59] <gnarf> but i need one of you tracking down the memory when it comes back
[11:44:00] <gnarf> i gotta run
[11:46:41] <s5fs> gnarf: many thanks!
[12:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Now that simple-log (node-logger) has been on npm for a while and is no longer tied directly to jQuery projects, I'm thinking of moving it out of the jQuery org.
[12:10:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i see no reason not to go scott_gonzalez with it
[12:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to transfer it and rename it to match the npm name.
[12:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> d'oh GitHub's rename page is 404ing.
[12:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's in my account now.
[12:28:45] <gnarf> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=be96be4ba2defeff&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10060&graphid=436
[12:28:54] <gnarf> its back up
[12:28:59] <gnarf> can someone get at it?
[12:29:30] <gnarf> cc Krinkle|detached scott_gonzalez s5fs
[12:29:37] <gnarf> figure out whats soaking up that ram
[12:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> $ ssh docs.jquery.com
[12:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
[12:50:02] <Krinkle> gnarf: Same here, connection denied again
[12:50:04] <Krinkle> Are we too late?
[12:50:53] <Krinkle> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/chart2.php?graphid=436&sid=be96be4ba2defeff&width=1031&period=349200&stime=201405011150
[12:52:01] <gnarf> i dunno
[12:52:04] <gnarf> maybe they didn't reboot
[12:56:23] <s5fs> gnarf: no response from MT on the ticket you opened, i'm guessing it wasn't rebooted
[12:58:58] <gnarf> maybe it just killed something that got restarted by puppet or whatever
[15:37:52] <gnarf> sigh
[15:37:55] <gnarf> so they rebooted it
[15:37:58] <gnarf> but still can't ssh in
[15:38:13] <gnarf> cc Krinkle s5fs
[15:38:53] <Krinkle> pong
[15:40:18] <gnarf> i think i'm gonna request that they restart it and /etc/init.d/apache stop
[15:40:31] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/c091fc7b39caf4f0274b
[15:41:01] <gnarf> memory doesn't seem THAT bad on that graph
[15:41:03] <gnarf> but then again
[15:41:10] <gnarf> these thing are terrible
[15:41:29] <gnarf> we should cut down our max servers in the config to see if we can figure out whats chewing up the ram
[15:56:35] <Krinkle> gnarf: http://docs.jquery.com/mw/profileinfo.php
[15:56:43] <Krinkle> I've narrowed it down to Database::query being the curlpit
[15:56:55] <Krinkle> queries are taking an average of 1432.14ms
[15:56:59] <Krinkle> that's insane
[15:57:17] <Krinkle> at least it is the cause of one of the problems somewhere in the stack
[15:57:25] <Krinkle> what causes that is something else
[15:58:31] <Krinkle> gnarf: As you'll probably have noticed (I did when I restarted apache yesterday) is that it instantly spawns several dozen processes and contrary to what you'd expect (idle pool to handle incoming requests), they are using 5-25% CPU each
[15:58:33] <Krinkle> right away
[15:58:52] <Krinkle> could be the result of php waiting for mysql, but I don't think so
[15:59:08] <Krinkle> Perhaps the cpu load is the cause of mysql being slow, or the other way around
[15:59:11] <gnarf> s5fs: around?
[15:59:57] <Krinkle> gnarf: nice gist, what command generates such a tree?
[16:00:11] <Krinkle> it looks like `top -c`, except for the tree
[16:00:57] <Krinkle> gnarf: We're not having luck are we? jq03 crashing, now eol3 as well.
[16:01:17] <Krinkle> I'll get on jenkins.jq.co later this week or early next week.
[16:06:53] <gnarf> as soon as I'm done with my work today, I'll call (mt) and be on the phone with the guy rebooting
[16:07:04] <gnarf> and try to get in early and lower the apache spare servers count
[16:07:11] <gnarf> cuz that might thrash us
[16:07:25] <gnarf> if something is moving slow, causing a bunch of spares to launch and eat up ram with php
[16:29:30] <Krinkle> gnarf: That is, assuming those apache idles are actually using CPU during idles.
[16:29:34] <Krinkle> perhaps there's just that many requests.
[16:32:28] <gnarf> in which case we need to not crash when there are that many request
[16:32:38] <gnarf> we gotta tune down the request limit and firewall whoever is abusing
