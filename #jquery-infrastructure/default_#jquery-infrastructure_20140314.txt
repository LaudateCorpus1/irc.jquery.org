[11:12:44] <gnarf> something seems strange here
[11:12:48] <gnarf> not sure why the charts are dipping
[11:12:57] <gnarf> don't know if i have time to investigate right now
[15:19:05] <s5fs> i'm going home soon i can look then
[18:32:02] <s5fs> gnarf: /tmp/domain_mapping.log got huge (2.6) on origin, eating up all the disk space. I cleared the file out but what does it do, and should I be rotating this?
[19:04:25] <s5fs> gnarf: re the dipping chart, it seems like we just had a pretty huge burst of traffic, then two smaller bumps. what do you think that's about? the referrers during the high period times make me wonder if it wasn't an ad network that messed something up (somehow?) and generated a bunch of traffic. thoughts?
