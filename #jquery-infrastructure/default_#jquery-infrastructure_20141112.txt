[09:04:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm using the target task sometimes, to deploy directly on stage
[09:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's going away in the next release.
[09:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> If you really want that functionality, we can just change the Gruntfiles to use `require( "./config" )` instead of `grunt.file.readJSON( "config.json" )`.
[09:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Then you could have a config.js instead of a config.json.
[09:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> But the current implementation is barely used and has a really bad API design.
[09:11:47] <jzaefferer> Okay, I should need that for our sites (need to look into some broken local WordPress sites again) and for jqueryvalidation.org I can adjust my gruntfile
