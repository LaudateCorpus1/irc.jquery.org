[09:18:39] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I just deployed an update for jquery-license and tested it with a PR against the jquery-license repo. Webhooks failed to deliver, "Service Timeout": https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/settings/hooks
[09:19:01] <jzaefferer> I see nothing in the syslog on the server, so I currently can't tell where the issue is located
[09:20:07] <gnarf> jzaefferer: hrm , redliver?
[09:20:25] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the process wasn't running - maybe "reload" is broken
[09:20:37] <gnarf> i did an /etc/init.d/jquery-license start
[09:27:00] <jzaefferer> gnarf: thanks, that worked.
[09:27:14] <jzaefferer> any idea why it failed to restart though?
[09:27:26] <jzaefferer> is there some way for us to catch that the process isn't running anymore?
[09:28:51] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yes - one of the things on my short list for handling the infra stuff right now is migrating to upstart
[09:56:05] <jzaefferer> sounds good
[09:59:53] <jzaefferer> gnarf: btw. since that restart its working as intended, automatically rechecking previously failed PRs; that should reduce a lot of frustration for newcomers
