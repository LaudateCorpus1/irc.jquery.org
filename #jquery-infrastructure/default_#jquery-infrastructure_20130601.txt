[10:06:27] <gnarf> jzaefferer: those are the same server
[10:08:02] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I see, thanks. I could've ls'ed the var/www/html directory myself :-)
[16:31:48] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: I posted more changes to the github stats update pr from earlier in the week, hopefully it's closer to what you're expecting. i'm standing up a local wp install so i can set up the wp integration next.
