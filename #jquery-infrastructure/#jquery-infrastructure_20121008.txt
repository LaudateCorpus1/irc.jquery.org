[14:33:03] <gnarf> clarkbox: hoot at your tweet - but yay
[15:11:35] <gnarf> danheberden: you around? -- take a look at http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/screens.php?config=0&elementid=5&sid=8e0ba53f4863f600&stime=201309290816&period=21600
[15:14:17] <danheberden> that's a spike
[15:14:39] <danheberden> or am i supposed to be looking at somethin else
[15:17:34] <gnarf> yeah the spike
[15:17:45] <gnarf> thats just jqueryui.com / api.jqueryui.com getting moved onto jq01
[15:18:02] <gnarf> although these are two of the bigger traffic sources
[15:18:09] <gnarf> (jqueryui.com)
[15:18:16] <gnarf> still, a little scary
[15:18:42] <gnarf> also, jq02 is serving downloads
[15:35:43] <gnarf> clarkbox: did you want me to merge the splunk stuff myself, or were you gonna do it?
[15:35:54] <clarkbox> i can do it
[15:35:58] <clarkbox> haven't had time to work on it today yet
[15:36:11] <clarkbox> ill look to merge into the staging branch late tonight
[15:40:14] <gnarf> k
[16:07:49] <gnarf> clarkbox: one other http://view.jqueryui.com/
[16:08:01] <gnarf> needs to git fetch -t to grab tags too
[16:08:11] <gnarf> because now jquery-ui doesn't actually tag a commit that is in the main branches
[16:08:11] <clarkbox> ok
[16:08:14] <gnarf> it tags an orphan
[16:08:19] <gnarf> so the 1.9.0 tag isn't showing up
[18:26:33] <clarkbox> gnarf, i don't have any DNS results of eol01.jquery.com
[18:26:44] <clarkbox> as well as eol02 and eol03
[18:27:00] <clarkbox> hmmm, are they just eol1, eol2, and eol3?
[18:56:28] <clarkbox> gnarf, i have cleared off all old splunk installs
[18:56:57] <clarkbox> about to push update to puppet-splunk. take a look and let me know how that looks

[22:32:40] <clarkbox> how does puppet-stage look
[22:32:56] <clarkbox> i didn't add anything to the eol servers
[22:35:40] <gnarf> did you push to stage?
[22:35:49] <gnarf> you mean puppet-splunk?

[23:00:37] <clarkbox> whats the interval between puppet runs? not seeing it on citadel yet
[23:00:56] <gnarf> 30 min, you can sudo puppet agent --test
[23:06:30] <clarkbox> dohâ€¦ notice: /Stage[main]/Splunk::Indexer/Exec[install-splunk]/returns: dpkg: error processing splunkIndexer.deb (--install):
[23:06:30] <clarkbox> notice: /Stage[main]/Splunk::Indexer/Exec[install-splunk]/returns:  package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64)
