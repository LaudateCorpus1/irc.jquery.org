[08:33:03] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: yt?
[08:38:48] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: kinda sorta
[08:39:06] <ryanneufeld> got a min to test something?
[08:39:48] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: sure
[08:39:58] <ryanneufeld> have you got latest virtualbox and vagrant installed?
[08:40:13] <Krinkle> neither on this machine
[08:40:29] <ryanneufeld> ok, then you won't be able to help much :P
[08:41:04] <Krinkle> updating virtualbox to 4.3,6
[08:42:29] <ryanneufeld> k, you'll need latest vagrant as well
[08:43:09] <ryanneufeld> ping scott_gonzalez you around?
[08:44:41] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: once you've got the software clone https://github.com/ryanneufeld/jquery-wp-content
[08:44:51] <ryanneufeld> checkout the wp-vm branch
[08:44:57] <ryanneufeld> and run vagrant up
[08:48:13] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: k
[08:48:22] <Krinkle> its fetching the box from dropbox now
[08:48:51] <ryanneufeld> nice
[08:48:57] <ryanneufeld> if it comes up with no errors
[08:49:09] <ryanneufeld> you should be able to go to http://vagrant.jquery.com/
[08:49:18] <ryanneufeld> and get a wordpress install prompt
[08:54:54] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: 
[08:54:55] <Krinkle> transfer closed with 250106114 bytes remaining to read 
[08:55:04] <Krinkle> trying again
[08:55:08] <ryanneufeld> doh
[08:55:09] <ryanneufeld> k
[09:04:46] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: https://gist.github.com/Krinkle/fd05e2411e2477f88f11
[09:04:57] <ryanneufeld> cool
[09:05:08] <ryanneufeld> can you get to vagrant.jquery.com?
[09:05:11] <Krinkle> http://vagrant.jquery.com/wp-admin/install.php
[09:05:13] <Krinkle> works
[09:05:21] <ryanneufeld> YES!!!
[09:05:23] <ryanneufeld> thanks man
[09:05:31] <ryanneufeld> all that hacking at the conf paid off
[09:05:46] <ryanneufeld> two people have now been able to reproduce this
[09:06:22] <Krinkle> ran the installer
[09:06:41] <Krinkle> after that http://vagrant.jquery.com/ looks like jquery.com
[09:06:55] <Krinkle> though the front page is 404
[09:07:00] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[09:07:04] <ryanneufeld> that's exactly what you should get
[09:07:09] <ryanneufeld> perfect
[09:07:20] <Krinkle> WordPress 3.8.1 running jquery-com theme.
[09:07:41] <Krinkle> http://i.imgur.com/ym0QAoD.jpg

[09:23:19] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: wanna try the wp-content vm?
[09:24:17] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: new box lands me at the WP config screen, site title "jQuery"
[09:24:22] <gnarf> was already looking at it
[09:24:24] <s5fs> no errors at all
[09:24:35] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: so you get the wp install screen?

[09:27:17] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: downloading box now
[09:27:44] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: do we want to host these on a maxcdn push zone?
[09:28:04] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: we can host them whereever
[09:28:14] <ryanneufeld> once we know it works, we can just change the url
[09:28:16] <gnarf> lets get them out of our dropbox :)
[09:28:20] <ryanneufeld> and push the box somewhere else
[09:29:23] <ryanneufeld> I'm happy to have them out of my dropbox
[09:29:25] <ryanneufeld> that's for sure
[09:29:39] <s5fs> haha!~

[10:35:53] <s5fs> i had to set up my own wifi ap in my hotel room in order to share the connection since it only had a single ethernet cable in the room

[11:27:39] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: have you used your console cable on mac to connect to your BBB?
[11:27:52] <ryanneufeld> haven't even powered on the bbb
[11:27:54] <s5fs> whats the magic here? how do I identify which serial device to use?
[11:27:57] <s5fs> well, rpi, same story
[11:28:02] <ryanneufeld> neither
[11:28:13] <s5fs> okay i'll check back in a few weeks ;)
[11:28:18] <ryanneufeld> haha
[11:28:23] <ryanneufeld> are you on a mac?

[11:32:24] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:32:32] <ryanneufeld> NoZAP-PL2303-10.9 is what the device is called on my machine

[20:05:44] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: did you cherry-pick or rebase that? you ended up with two different commits - i merged them back together?
[21:23:21] <ryanneufeld> I cherry-picked from stage to master
[21:23:33] <ryanneufeld> my wp-vm branch has been rebased on puppet-stage
[21:23:38] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ^^
[21:23:52] <gnarf> yeah
[21:23:54] <gnarf> just merge
[21:23:55] <gnarf> :)
[21:24:14] <gnarf> 9 times out of 10 it should be a "fast-forward"
[21:24:22] <gnarf> when you cherry-pick it breaks the "equality" on the branches
[21:24:42] <gnarf> in general puppet-stage === puppet-master most times
[21:25:01] <gnarf> so commit stage, push, test, checkout master, merge stage, push, test is my general workflow
[21:29:23] <ryanneufeld> ok
[21:29:35] <ryanneufeld> a cherry-pick shouldn't throw it out of whack
[21:29:48] <ryanneufeld> unless they already had different bases
[21:30:05] <ryanneufeld> perhaps a reset --hard puppet-master on the puppet-stage branch is in order?
[21:30:39] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: do you agree?
[21:31:08] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nah, i just merged them back together 
[21:31:22] <gnarf> i don't mind the merge commits in the infra repo
[21:31:58] <ryanneufeld> is there a reason we're not using the default master branch?
