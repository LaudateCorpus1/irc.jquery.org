[08:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ryanneufeld danheberden: Is anyone around to flip the switch on api.jquerymobile.com DNS?
[08:59:25] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I can take a look
[09:00:10] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: where should it be pointed?
[09:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> 70.32.120.34
[09:01:04] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/0d1H1F2z0b3g
[09:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[09:01:19] <ryanneufeld> confirming that looks correct
[09:01:26] <ryanneufeld> Success
[09:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's where other API sites point, right?
[09:01:37] <ryanneufeld> I dunno
[09:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, removing my hosts entry.
[09:01:44] <ryanneufeld> lemme double check
[09:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's what a ping returns for other sites :-)
[09:01:52] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[09:02:07] <ryanneufeld> but is that host configured jquerymobile?
[09:02:19] <ryanneufeld> oh, hosts, you've been testing it at that IP
[09:02:25] <ryanneufeld> okay, then it should be okay
[09:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I put an entry in my /etc/hosts so I could deploy before the DNS change.
[09:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> So that there would be content as soon as it starts resolving.
[09:03:05] <ryanneufeld> good call
[09:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> Is api.jquerymobile.com resolving for you right now?
[09:04:07] <ryanneufeld> I see new hotness
[09:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks!
[09:04:55] <ryanneufeld> np, that's what I'm here for :)
[09:14:41] <johnbender> gnarf: question for you about puppet
[09:14:52] <johnbender> does the puppet master alow arbitrary config data?
[09:14:53] <ryanneufeld> hi johnbender
[09:14:59] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: you can probably answer this too
[09:15:06] <ryanneufeld> in what way?
[09:15:07] <johnbender> this is purely a curiousity question
[09:15:14] <ryanneufeld> arbirary how?
[09:15:26] <ryanneufeld> you specify config down to the node
[09:15:26] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: well, with chef you do a state bag and you hydrate a role with the config stuff in the state bag
[09:15:34] <johnbender> ok probably the same thing
[09:15:58] <ryanneufeld> I know as much about chef as I do astrophysics
[09:16:07] <ryanneufeld> which is nothing, I know nothing about chef
[09:16:07] <johnbender> one approach to the "passwords in config" issue is to store it as part of the node specific state/config in the chef server
[09:16:23] <johnbender> that is, on the management server
[09:16:29] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: you mean shell passwords?
[09:16:39] <ryanneufeld> like for user accounts?
[09:16:40] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: or keys for api access
[09:16:41] <johnbender> etc
[09:16:53] <johnbender> stuff you don't want commited to a repo
[09:17:21] <ryanneufeld> so with chef you can manage them separately?
[09:18:02] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yah the config and the recipes are separate 
[09:18:04] <johnbender> or can be
[09:18:06] <johnbender> with a chef server
[09:18:29] <johnbender> you can really parameterize the whole thing
[09:18:37] <johnbender> obviously you can overdo that but it has value
[09:18:47] <johnbender> I'm wondering if the puppet master setup has an analogue
[09:20:10] <ryanneufeld> if it does, I'm not aware of ity
[09:20:14] <ryanneufeld> *-y

[13:01:38] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: when you're done helping scott_gonzalez can you ping me?
[13:02:12] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: thats gonna be a long term thing today, whats up? :)
[13:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> There's not enough help in the world for him to be done with me :-p
[13:03:18] <ryanneufeld> I wanted to ask you about how you manage the post-commit hooks, like how they all work etc
[13:03:52] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: jquery::postreceive in puppet
[13:04:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: mostly, its just a node process i cobbled together that receives the post-receive from github, then spawns a .sh file if it matches 
[13:04:25] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/gnarf37/node-notifier-server
[13:04:43] <ryanneufeld> that one?
[13:04:45] <gnarf> yup
[13:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> Using the awesome git-notifier module :-)
[13:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> It's uncanny how much server code I write for jQuery.
[13:06:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that it is
[13:06:17] <gnarf> i'd say that too, but like, it's kinda my job i guess ;)
[13:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah
[13:06:36] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: it's uncanny how much _____ code you write for jQuery
[13:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:08:22] <ryanneufeld> I wish I had a job that would let me spend more time on jQuery
[13:08:35] <ryanneufeld> I'm currently looking for one that will :p
[13:09:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, i got the init script sending HUP's now on plugins push
[13:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm gonna make this change now.
[13:12:20] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: are you using the node notifier to trigger the pulls on the puppet repos too?
[13:13:28] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yup https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/citadel.pp#L10-L32
[13:17:17] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: its super hackish, but it works
[13:17:34] <ryanneufeld> I guess security isn't really an issue?
[13:18:11] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: there are a few layers of potential security, but basically, it only introduces a SHA
[13:18:36] <gnarf> we thought about adding some "verification" into the git-notifier module
[13:18:44] <ryanneufeld> guess it's not a big deal if someone pings that end point
[13:19:23] <gnarf> i don't think we ever added IP Verification, but its always possible
[13:19:59] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to go about it for our stuff
[13:20:05] <ryanneufeld> might just write a php script
[13:20:12] <ryanneufeld> since we don't use node for anything else
[13:20:25] <ryanneufeld> doesn't seem to be much logic on it
[13:21:26] <gnarf> nope
[13:29:51] <gnarf> danheberden: do we have a gmail account dedicated to making server/services be able to SMTP relay through gmail?
[13:34:14] <danheberden> gnarf: no, i don't think we do
[13:34:32] <danheberden> that's a good idea though
[13:34:33] <gnarf> danheberden: do you know if we setup any relay servers, or just let the machine deliver then?
[13:35:08] <danheberden> i'm trying to remember if we had any mail services set up at all
[13:35:10] <danheberden> i don't think we did
[13:35:43] <gnarf> cc clarkbox ^^^
[13:38:10] <clarkbox> i would be afraid of hitting the gmail send limit
[13:39:08] <clarkbox> if a particular uses screws up, and spams hundreds of alerts, legitimate alerts could get blocked
[13:40:33] <clarkbox> good ole postfix/sendmail would be just as easy
[13:40:55] <clarkbox> (well almost as easy)

[17:23:58] <clarkbox> gnarf, are you starting splunk? or does puppet start it if its shut down?
[18:05:59] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/splunk/manifests/setup.pp
[18:06:05] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: ^^
[18:06:13] <ryanneufeld> looks like it should ensure it's running
[18:06:37] <clarkbox> ah ok. that must be why. thanks
