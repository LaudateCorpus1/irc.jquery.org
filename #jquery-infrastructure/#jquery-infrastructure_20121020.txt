[10:37:17] <ajpiano> danheberden: ping
[10:37:37] <ajpiano> i'm trying to switch to the local.jquery stuff
[10:37:41] <ajpiano> which is awesome btw
[10:37:47] <ajpiano> but i'm getting: "Domain mapping issue. You have web-base-template configured for dev.jquery.com."
[10:38:27] <danheberden> ajpiano: you have to obliterate the wp db
[10:38:30] <danheberden> and re-install
[10:38:39] <ajpiano> ohh
[10:38:42] <danheberden> the upgrade script is near completion
[10:38:54] <danheberden> so soon you'll be able to do `grunt wordpress:update`
[10:39:18] <ajpiano> should i hold off so i can wait and test it
[10:39:41] <danheberden> your call - if you want to make a new db and re-clone somewhere else
[10:39:47] <danheberden> definitely wouldn't hurt
[10:39:59] <ajpiano> i guess that's easy enough
[10:40:15] <ajpiano> it's kind of crazy that we've managed to get this down to a 15 minute process as is
[10:40:19] <danheberden> i'm actually on my way to the coffee shop to work on that more
[10:40:21] <gnarf> heh
[10:40:41] <danheberden> and so with that, afk for 20 minutes or so :p
[10:41:08] <gnarf> ajpiano: also, did you update the WP_STAGING_PREFIX or whatever to be "local" instead of "dev" ?
[10:41:55] <ajpiano> gnarf: where is that
[10:42:29] <gnarf> looks like its the new default
[10:42:30] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/config.php#L15
[10:43:11] <ajpiano> yeah it's updated, i'm on latest web-base-template
[22:42:38] <clarkbox> hey cory, the hostname on that new MT machine is reporting as just "splunk". is it supposed to be full domain?
[22:42:50] <clarkbox> gnarf ^
[22:44:25] <clarkbox> should i change it by hand? i thought puppet would take care of that?
