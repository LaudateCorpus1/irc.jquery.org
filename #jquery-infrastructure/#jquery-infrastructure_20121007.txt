[09:55:15] <ryanneufeld> morning
[11:46:10] <ryanneufeld> gnarf, clarkbox you there?
[12:15:41] <clarkbox> whats up ryanneufeld
[12:16:04] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at your howto
[12:16:04] <clarkbox> i am just on my way out the door. ill be back in 30min
[12:16:12] <clarkbox> ya..?
[12:16:26] <ryanneufeld> it can wait, if you're gonna be back soon
[12:16:38] <clarkbox> ok
[12:16:43] <ryanneufeld> I just pushed a bunch of table branches :p
[12:16:50] <ryanneufeld> i wasn't sure what the intent was for managing the code
[12:16:59] <ryanneufeld> since the summit repo doesn't have the git stuff in it
[12:17:01] <ryanneufeld> *infra
[12:17:09] <ryanneufeld> -git +infra
[12:18:01] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: did we have plans for how we wanted to deal with this?
[12:22:29] <ajpiano> yeah i um
[12:22:31] <ajpiano> am on vacation
[12:22:35] <ajpiano> but the whole branches for each table thing
[12:22:38] <ajpiano> i wasn't sure what that was about at all
[12:22:46] <ajpiano> meant to ask clarkbox about that earlier :p
[12:23:04] <ajpiano> i'm not entirely sure we plan to have everyone using vagrant/vms instead of just configuring web base template etc locally
[12:23:13] <ajpiano> i guess whichever's easier for people is what we'll point them too
[12:23:54] <ryanneufeld> I though the plan was to have everyone using the vms so that they were working in the right environment
[12:25:28] <ryanneufeld> also it means that everyone is working on the same thing
[12:32:44] <clarkbox> ya i have no idea
[12:32:52] <clarkbox> i was just getting things rolling
[12:33:00] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:34:07] <gnarf> people that can use their own can use their own, the VMs will be for people pretty much at our table & maybe site build
[12:37:25] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:38:01] <ryanneufeld> so, for those working on wordpress themes
[12:38:07] <ryanneufeld> would they be using a VM?
[12:39:00] <gnarf> there are instructions out there for people to set it up on a Apache/MySQL/PHP stack
[12:39:00] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to figure out who this how to I'm writing should be targeted at
[12:39:16] <gnarf> team members
[12:39:38] <gnarf> for the puppet/vagrant thing?
[12:41:27] <ryanneufeld> yes
[12:42:04] <ryanneufeld> johnbender wrote this https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/vagrant/README.md
[12:42:17] <ryanneufeld> and that's pretty much what I had when I started
[12:46:31] <ryanneufeld> anyone recommend a markdown editor? I'm using sublime text, but I'd like to be able see the rendered output of it
[13:09:46] <clarkbox> so ill just trash that page. i thought everyone would use a vagrant to work within an established environment.
[13:22:38] <ryanneufeld> I think that makes the most sense honestly
[13:22:48] <ryanneufeld> but it seems the jury is out
[13:56:10] <gnarf> clarkbox: we might set something up, it might be useful
[13:56:33] <gnarf> the problem is "local editors"
[13:56:48] <gnarf> we might be able to setup a "Vagrantfile" in web-base-template tho
[13:57:18] <gnarf> if we were to do it, i think thats where we'd do it
[13:57:51] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: the other option is another repo
[13:58:02] <ryanneufeld> that one I was working on before
[13:58:06] <ryanneufeld> that you helped me iwth
[13:58:19] <ryanneufeld> is intended to be a php 5.4 with apapche
[13:58:26] <gnarf> 5.3
[13:58:32] <gnarf> oh
[13:58:34] <gnarf> yeah
[13:58:44] <ryanneufeld> why 5.3?
[13:59:07] <ryanneufeld> is there an argument against 5.4? or is it simply package availability?
