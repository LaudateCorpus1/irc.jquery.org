[03:48:46] <jzaefferer> hey Krinkle|detached
[09:07:48] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: we didn't have the meeting yesterday
[09:07:52] <ryanneufeld> I think we all forgot
[09:07:56] <ryanneufeld> or were traveling
[14:07:51] <Krinkle|detached> jzaefferer: Hi
[14:09:31] <gnarf> thats fine
[14:09:36] <gnarf> ryan
[14:09:47] <gnarf> im gonna be mostly afk the rest of today too
[14:23:38] <jzaefferer> hey Krinkle
[14:23:48] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: your working hours are really… interesting
[14:24:20] <jzaefferer> we're in the same timezone, yet it seems like you work (on jQuery) when I sleep :-)
[14:25:49] <Krinkle> I sleep ~ between 8am - 3pm. I've shifted about 7 hours ahead of my timezone. I detailed this before (easier communication with US/Australian workers, whilst still having ~ 4 hours a day of overlap with people awake in europe (in their evening).
[14:26:23] <Krinkle> And because it is easier to work at night in my neighbourhood (nice and quiet). My backyard is literally attached to a school
[14:26:54] <jzaefferer> Ah, right, now I remember
[14:26:56] <Krinkle> and on the front a busy street with traffic, and between school and traffic there's kids playing and stuff.
[14:27:25] <jzaefferer> It still makes a lot of sense. I guess I just regret that our work times overlap so little.
[14:27:37] <Krinkle> we can work asynchronous though, there's that.
[14:28:26] <Krinkle> more productivity (theoretically speaking, anyway). Anyhow, as far as planning is concerned, pretend I'm in San Francisco.
[14:28:58] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I pushed a whole lot of stuff to the ua-parser branch on testswarm.
[14:29:20] <Krinkle> And, since it will break browserSets completely, I also have a change to testswarm-browserstack pending.
[14:29:35] <Krinkle> we need to act quick now, as browscap is dieying
[14:29:52] <jzaefferer> Nice. Regarding the progress, not so much the breaking-everything ;)
[14:30:18] <Krinkle> Well, "break", I'd say "enhance", but the localSettings.json entry is incompatible
[14:30:37] <Krinkle> it used to be an array of akward ID syntax strings, but that doesn't scale for OS / devices and more precise version matching
[14:30:54] <Krinkle> so it will now be an object keyed by a unique ID (freeform), with a descriptor object as value.
[14:31:14] <Krinkle> BrowserStack replaced Opera 12.0 with 12.1 earlier yesterday. That halted all our builds as there was no worker available for opera 12.0
[14:31:32] <Krinkle> Even when I found out, I couldn't fix it, since browscap didn't parse Opera 12.1 properly
[14:32:18] <Krinkle> I'm still not quite sure what made them think it is ok to just drop a version from the matrix (I mean, Firefox 3, IE6, Chrome 15, Opera 11.1, 11.5, 11.6 etc. they're all there
[14:32:27] <Krinkle> But anyhow, they're putting it back per my request.
[14:33:03] <Krinkle> I'm maintaining like 7 different support threads on average right now. Mostly shortlived (which is cool, they're very responsive and fastly iterating and improving)
[14:33:08] <Krinkle> (with browserstack)
[14:33:38] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: most of this code has gone through cross-review from different people on different pull requests, however I'd like a sanity check before I push it
[14:33:53] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/tree/ua-parser
[14:34:00] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/ua-parser/config/sample-localSettings.json
[14:34:40] <Krinkle> As you can see browser is even optional (one can define a uaID with just os and os version, if that's all you need)
[14:35:05] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: dropping 12.0 was indeed an odd choice
[14:35:26] <Krinkle> This is what the sample settings look like when rendered: http://cl.ly/image/3W2s2B412j35
[14:35:35] <Krinkle> (I use ::after to render the OS icons inside the browser icons :) )
[14:35:56] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: can you open a code-review PR for the ui-parser?
[14:36:02] <jzaefferer> *ua-parser
[14:36:11] <jzaefferer> or am I missing one?
[14:36:15] <Krinkle> it has gone in the us-parser through PRs
[14:36:37] <Krinkle> I changed the PRs to drop to ua-parser instead of master so I could test it without breaking immediately.
[14:36:48] <jzaefferer> screenshot and sample-localSettings.json looks good
[14:37:13] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/244
[14:37:50] <jzaefferer> that touches a lot of files
[14:38:11] <Krinkle> yes, this includes everything from browscap>ua-parser to fixing the browserSets model to be objects instead of strings.
[14:38:22] <Krinkle> (3 different commits though)
[14:38:22] <jzaefferer> clone --recursive tells git to also update submodules?
[14:38:31] <Krinkle> I guess, yes.
[14:38:39] <Krinkle> You mean the readme?
[14:38:42] <jzaefferer> yep
[14:38:50] <Krinkle> Yeah, because we're using tobie/ua-parser as submodule.
[14:38:54] <jzaefferer> would the tarball include submodules as well?
[14:39:04] <jzaefferer> if not, that or step isn't very useful
[14:39:04] <Krinkle> don't know
[14:39:25] <Krinkle> But that part is of the browscap-migration, which was already reviewed in a separate PR
[14:39:34] <Krinkle> there's inline discussion on that in the PR for that.
[14:39:45] <Krinkle> the first commit in this branch got there through a PR, the other 2 are mine.
[14:40:19] <Krinkle> which I committed to the branch directly and should be reviewed now as part of this PR. Feel free to check all of it of course, it's a lot of information to take in.
[14:40:46] <jzaefferer> well, if something was missed in earlier PRs… I'll just test this
[14:40:46] <Krinkle> I'd recommend first installing it though and work from there, it'll make more sense (though my commit messages should speak mostly for themselves)
[14:40:52] <Krinkle> yeah, by all means.
[14:41:42] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: nope, submodule isn't included in download
[14:41:51] <Krinkle> yeah, I knew that actually.
[14:41:59] <jzaefferer> :p
[14:42:10] <Krinkle> sorry, forgot about that. It's a well known issue with github.
[14:42:29] <jzaefferer> lets just drop the "or download latest" line from the readme
[14:42:31] <Krinkle> anyhow, if that is a blocker, we can fix that before release.
[14:42:41] <Krinkle> Sure, that works too.
[14:44:08] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: once merged, do we need to update anything besides TestSwarm itself?
[14:45:01] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: we'll have to prepare a different version of localSettings.json on jq03 and quickly swap them live.
[14:45:21] <Krinkle> and we need to deploy testswarm-browserstack at the same time.
[14:45:41] <jzaefferer> so pull testswarm, swap localSettings and update testwarm-browserstack, fun
[14:45:43] <jzaefferer> anything else?
[14:45:52] <jzaefferer> no DB migration, right?
[14:45:53] <Krinkle> as usual, we're early adopters so master is only compatible with master. No tags yet for these projects, 1.0 is nearing :)
[14:46:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: nope, no DB changes.
[14:46:35] <Krinkle> My uaID system abstracts that already, I took care of that when we migrated from jresig's regex parser to browscap.org
[14:46:40] <Krinkle> we keep the same abstraction layer.
[14:47:20] <jzaefferer> right
[14:47:53] <jzaefferer> well, I'm not going to review the PHP code in detail. Everything else I see and can think of right now is looking good
[14:48:04] <Krinkle> fixing readme now
[14:48:38] <jzaefferer> at this point, you probably won't see that much activity on testswarm projects anymore. If you deploy in two or three hours, it would very unlikely that anything breaks...
[14:49:05] <Krinkle> you mean this time of day?
[14:49:22] <Krinkle> (i.e. past midnight UTC)
[14:50:06] <jzaefferer> yeah
[14:50:44] <jzaefferer> jQuery projects became mostly boring 9-5 projects, in terms of commit activity ;)
[14:51:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: also, the change I have to make in testswarm-browserstack has a nice sideeffect
[14:51:13] <Krinkle> We can drop most of map.js there
[14:51:17] <jzaefferer> nice
[14:51:34] <jzaefferer> what about the v2 api? did that land by now? I very much lost track
[14:51:36] <Krinkle> we now tie the link directly between browserstack-api/browsers list and testswarm's browserSets uaData properties.
[14:51:45] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: yep, landed and deployed
[14:51:50] <Krinkle> running live for about 2-3 days now.
[14:52:33] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[14:52:36] <Krinkle> However we can't make use of any non-standard OS/devices yet because TestSwarm's browserSets system as it is now in master only has "browser|version" syntax.
[14:52:43] <Krinkle> Hence the refactoring of that needed with ua-parser
[14:53:23] <Krinkle> cf. https://github.com/Krinkle/testswarm-browserstack/commits/testswarm-ua-parser
[14:53:33] <Krinkle> (just the one commit)
[14:54:12] <jzaefferer> right
[15:02:45] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I'd appreciate if you'd land new QUnit features only after I approve (or whatever) as well. Apart from that, your help maintaing that project, along with TestSwarm, is very welcome!
[15:03:24] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I wasn't sure about propEqual. I did assign it to you, but wasn't quite sure what you wanted me to do.
[15:04:38] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: well, assigning isn't very useful, I pretty much ignore that. If you need input on something, just ping me somewhere, and I'll pay attention. Otherwise I may wait a few weeks until I can focus on QUnit for a few hours or days in a row.
[15:05:41] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: ok
[15:15:56] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: so I'll deploy this testswarm madness tonight, okay ?
[15:16:06] <Krinkle> (in about 2 hours)
[15:16:35] <jzaefferer> yep
[15:16:39] <jzaefferer> though I'll go to sleep now
[15:16:40] <Krinkle> Mobile will be able to start using it more as well from tomorrow onwards.
[15:16:44] <Krinkle> Sure.
[15:16:48] <jzaefferer> ttyl
[15:16:50] <Krinkle> You'll wake up to a new world ;-)
[15:16:55] <jzaefferer> hehe
[15:17:03] <jzaefferer> sounds bad bro
[15:17:11] <Krinkle> android, ios etc.
[15:17:52] <Krinkle> Those icons look nice on swarm.jquery.org accent they don't work since browserstack v1 didn't support those.
[15:18:04] <Krinkle> but from tomorrow on they'll be in action.
[15:18:10] <Krinkle> aight, ttyl
[15:28:09] <clarkbox> nice work krinkle
[15:28:41] <Krinkle> clarkbox: I'd appreciate it if you could give it a sanity check as well (testswarm-browserstack in particular)
[15:29:12] <clarkbox> will do
[15:29:28] <Krinkle> The tests ran fine locally, so if you want to go to bed (what timezone are you in anyway?) that's fine, we can make ammendments later as well. but earlier is better of course.
[15:29:42] <clarkbox> I'm pacific. 3:30pm here
[15:29:46] <Krinkle> nice
[15:29:59] <clarkbox> so ill keep my eye on it for the next 10~ hours
[15:30:05] <Krinkle> clarkbox: That's the same as in San Francisco, r ight ?
[15:30:09] <clarkbox> yes
[15:30:11] <Krinkle> ok
[15:30:13] <clarkbox> i am in the SF area
[15:30:21] <Krinkle> nice
[15:30:25] <clarkbox> ill setup some alerts in splunk to warn us if things go off the rails
[15:30:43] <Krinkle> Maybe we can meet next time I'm visiting Wikimedia for a few weeks
[15:30:54] <clarkbox> ya definitely. let me know when your inbound
[15:31:01] <Krinkle> I'm there for 3 weeks a few times a year.
[15:31:17] <Krinkle> Next time is expected to be in mid-January/February
[15:31:18] <clarkbox> cool
[15:31:49] <clarkbox> I'm going to look at improving the logging a little more maybe. there is a lot of noise going to the log file that is not needed
[15:31:58] <Krinkle> yeah
[15:32:08] <clarkbox> ill wrap a few more log's with if(.verbose)
[15:33:03] <Krinkle> clarkbox: One thing I'd like to get out of if-verbose is the reason for terminating a browser (e.g. disconnected from swarm, neediness exhausted, ... )
[15:34:06] <Krinkle> be careful though, I tested this like crazy, I feel like I want to make sure this makes it live before adding more complexity to the deployment queue.
[15:34:14] <Krinkle> log message are innocent though
[15:37:54] <clarkbox> ya i agree. on that note, i am hoping to get some time to write some tests this week/end
