[05:52:12] <ajpiano> hmmmm, seems simple enough
[11:17:46] <gnarf> bah net issues today
[11:18:04] <gnarf> can you add orkel to infra team scott_gonzalez?
[11:18:19] <gnarf> i just keep getting "This webpage is not available"
[11:18:19] <gnarf> for like every http request
[11:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: On GitHub?
[11:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> Or Google Groups?
[11:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or both?
[11:18:51] <gnarf> github
[11:19:06] <gnarf> he wants to look at the nginx configs for swarm/jenkins
[11:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> added
[11:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> Did you actually want him on -contrib?
[11:23:33] <gnarf> um
[11:23:33] <gnarf> yes :)
[11:24:49] <gnarf> orkel: FYI - infrastructure/manifests/nodes/jenkins.pp - the "builds.jenkins.jquery.com" seem to have the stuff that the old swarm domain had
[11:24:51] <gnarf> you should have access to peek at it now
[11:25:32] <gnarf> it's possible that the order of whatever might make it not work right
[11:25:33] <gnarf> orkel: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/jenkins.pp#L52
[11:25:33] <gnarf> orkel: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/files/vhosts/swarm.conf#L15
[11:25:34] <gnarf> the resulting config file is on jenkins.jquery.com /etc/nginx/conf.d/vhost_autogen.conf
[11:25:47] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: got a few minutes to help me with some .animate() code?
[11:26:13] <gnarf> probably - assuming i can look at it - about 70% of my http requests fail right now on my tether
[11:26:19] <ryanneufeld> boo
[11:26:41] <gnarf> i'm so glad IRC is so fault tolerant :)
[11:27:10] <ryanneufeld> pm'd you gnarf
[19:08:19] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: gnarf danheberden ryanneufeld anyone around???
[19:08:23] <ajpiano> seems like all our sites are down
[19:08:34] <ryanneufeld> I just got the pingdom
[19:10:12] <ryanneufeld> they seem fine on MT
[19:10:14] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: 
[19:10:30] <ryanneufeld> bad gateway...
[19:10:31] <ryanneufeld> odd
[19:16:36] <ajpiano> :/
[19:16:41] <ajpiano> can we just uh... restart it
[19:16:50] <ryanneufeld> I'm not convinced that's a solution
[19:20:42] <ryanneufeld> fuck it
[19:20:44] <ryanneufeld> rebooting
[19:25:19] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I rebooted jq01. I'll keep a ping on it so I know when it comes back up
[19:25:27] <ajpiano> ok
[19:25:51] <ryanneufeld> MT's automated thinger says it could take up to 10mins
[19:48:03] <ryanneufeld> Okay, so that didn't work
[19:48:32] <ryanneufeld> Trying again
[20:12:04] <ryanneufeld> ping ajpiano gnarf
[20:12:09] <ajpiano> hey
[20:12:14] <ajpiano> i don't know what's going on :/
[20:12:16] <ryanneufeld> so, it's not coming back up
[20:12:42] <ajpiano> i see that :/
[20:13:02] <ajpiano> might be time to call gnarf but i don't know if he has internet, he's in the middle of having moved
[20:13:55] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[20:14:00] <ryanneufeld> I'm on a skype call with MT
[20:14:03] <ryanneufeld> first in line
[20:15:34] <ryanneufeld> onnow
[20:16:27] <ajpiano> ok, i'll bbiab ryanneufeld
[20:16:58] <ryanneufeld> okay, they're investigating ajpiano
[20:24:06] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: MT is looking into it, as soon as they give me an answer via email, I'll fwd to you.
[20:24:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm afk for roughly an hour though as I have to drive home now.
[22:26:40] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: looks like we're back up
[22:31:42] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: any idea the cause?
[22:31:48] <gnarf> php fpm probably wasn't running?
[22:31:51] <ryanneufeld> it wasn't
[22:31:55] <ryanneufeld> but I couldn't get it to satrt
[22:32:07] <gnarf> hrm
[22:32:21] <ryanneufeld> I ended up doing a reboot through MT, but then apparently a backup was running causing it to take forever
[22:32:43] <gnarf> strange
[22:33:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[22:33:53] <gnarf> and yeah, my internet is shit - glad you guys had it covered though
[22:34:03] <ryanneufeld> I was still at work
[22:34:09] <ryanneufeld> so it was 'good' time
[22:34:24] <gnarf> cc s5fs ^^^ feel free to file tickets with (mt) if i'm out :)
