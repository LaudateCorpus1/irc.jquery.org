[07:10:19] <arschmitz> gnarf: s5fs: ryanneufeld: bugs.jquery.com is down
[07:55:16] <m_gol> gnarf s5fs ryannuefeld: trac is down
[08:02:10] <DaveMethvin> if there's some way to reboot trac that would be great, we will want to have it for the core meeting in an hour
[08:04:15] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: m_gol: restarter
[08:04:21] <gnarf> s/r$/d
[08:04:31] <DaveMethvin> restarter? i hardly knower!
[08:04:45] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf
[08:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> Is anyone interested in helping write some tooling (in node.js) for W3C?
[08:24:57] <scott_gonzalez> The task that would benefit a lot of Working Groups immediately would be finishing the script to send emails to specific mailing lists when PRs are sent against https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/
[08:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone is interested, ping me and I'll provide details.
[11:03:28] <arschmitz> gnarf: Ping!
[11:08:23] <gnarf> arschmitz: hey
[11:08:46] <arschmitz> gnarf: hey wanted to talk to you about the 2 new sites we need setup
[11:08:55] <gnarf> arschmitz: today is going to be bad 
[11:09:01] <arschmitz> themeroller.jquerymobile.com and demos.jquerymobile.com
[11:09:15] <arschmitz> thats fine i was really just looking for a REALLY rough timeline
[11:09:59] <gnarf> assuming they are both being forked from repos of the same name
[11:10:07] <gnarf> it should take <1 full day to get it setup when you need it
[11:10:31] <arschmitz> ok sweet
[11:10:50] <arschmitz> because we need them before we can switch to jquery-wp-content for jquerymobile.com
[11:10:58] <arschmitz> which we need to do when we release 1.4
[11:10:59] <gnarf> if you guys can create the repos and start filling them with content
[11:11:13] <gnarf> I can get a stage environment setup later today (after work) cc scott_gonzalez  ^^^
[11:11:15] <arschmitz> gnarf: no problem ill take care of it
[11:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Not sure if there was any infrastructure set up around this, but I just renamed the Mobile ThemeRoller repo.
[12:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs danheberden ryanneufeld: Any objections to enabling auto update for all versions of WordPress?
[12:51:00] <danheberden> since puppet just gets the latest anyway
[12:51:02] <danheberden> i'm down
[12:51:26] <danheberden> however, what kind of failsafe if X version is problematic?
[12:51:37] <danheberden> i'd want to have a plan of action for downgrading if necessary
[12:51:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: none, however I don't believe it can actually auto-update itself currently - I need to know what permissions/owners to set on what files
[12:51:57] <gnarf> cc nacin
[12:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> In most cases, we should be able to just grab a copy of the older version and throw it on the server.
[12:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> Worst case, we just redeploy all the sites.
[12:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> We're actually pretty safe from a terrible upgrade since everything is managed in git anyway.
[12:52:38] <nacin> downgrading is merely upgrading in reverse
[12:53:11] <arschmitz> nacin: that sounds really existential :)
[12:53:11] <nacin> honestly, updating to latest is never going to cause a problem. if you want: i am happy to be present for major versions, but automate minor versions
[12:53:17] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Which directory is the WordPress install that actually gets used?
[12:53:23] <nacin> I think I wrote a 10-line bash script on a GH issue once
[12:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: You did, but I was going to just: define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', true );
[12:54:08] <nacin> hey, I wrote that too :-)
[12:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> I read your blog post.
[12:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> Only two months late :-P
[12:54:48] <scott_gonzalez> Meeting George in person helped push me to actually tackle this.
[12:54:51] <nacin> it's likely going to detect that there is a git repo and not do an auto update, if I had to guess.
[12:54:57] <nacin> george is crazy.
[12:54:59] <nacin> glad it helped.
[12:55:19] <scott_gonzalez>  /var/www/wordpress isn't in git.
[12:55:27] <nacin> ah, ok.
[12:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> I checked when I was with George.
[12:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> But that directory contains wordpress, wordpress-3.5, wordpress-3.5-RC1, and jquery-wp-content.
[12:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> So it's kinda confusing.
[13:02:47] <nacin> seems like wordpress-3.5* are just left over from previous updates
[13:07:40] <gnarf> yup
[13:07:44] <gnarf> when i update
[13:07:53] <gnarf> i download lastest
[13:07:59] <gnarf> unzip to a folder
[13:08:05] <gnarf> move old to wordpress-old-version
[13:08:09] <gnarf> and move new to wordpress
[13:08:12] <gnarf> and its done
[13:08:19] <gnarf> cc s5fs ^^
[13:38:13] <ryanneufeld> I have no objections to an autoupdate. I haven't known many wordpress versions to be buggy
[14:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> Where does ABSPATH get defined?
[14:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still confused about which files are being used.
[14:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> The WordPress install is in /var/www/wordpress/wordpress.
[14:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> But the wp-config.php is in /var/www/wordpress.
[16:32:05] <s5fs> gnarf: i'm fine with manual upgrades, it sounds dead simple
[16:32:23] <s5fs> honestly i don't care how its done
[16:32:25] <s5fs> :)
