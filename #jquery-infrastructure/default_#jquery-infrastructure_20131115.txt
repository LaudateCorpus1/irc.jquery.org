[10:31:14] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: why no grunt for a release script? just curious.
[10:31:29] <nacin> not*
[10:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> Grunt is all about abstraction via config.
[10:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> That's not really helpful here.
[10:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> Grunt itself doen't really provide any value for a release script.
[10:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> At least not this type of release script.
[10:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> The release script will use grunt tasks from the repo though.
[10:33:28] <nacin> makes sense.
[10:33:51] <nacin> our own release script is just bash and some PHP, though we're looking to move the packaging process into grunt.
[10:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> You can take a look at the current UI release script: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js
[10:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> The new one will be pretty similar.
[10:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> But will need to provide hooks for each repo to do their own things at different points.
[10:35:38] <nacin> makes sense. for us, bash or PHP is more familiar territory anyway.
[10:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. I wrote the first script in bash. Which was a terrible idea since I don't know bash scripting.
[10:37:26] <scott_gonzalez> I can't tell you how painful that was.
[10:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/6888cec62a98b05cc9f09167b2872e7bab180315/build/release/prepare-release
[10:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> Also had to deal with SVN back then :-(
[10:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> The switch to using node made it possible for me to actually implement stuff.
[11:05:09] <nacin> yeah. for us, it was in bash, then it moved to PHP, but ultimately most of it is shell and can be moved back to bash.
[11:05:55] <gnarf> if you need some opinions on bash wizardry, i can aid
