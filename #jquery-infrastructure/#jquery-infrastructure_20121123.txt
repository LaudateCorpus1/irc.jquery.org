[11:19:17] <Krinkle|detached> clarkbox: I played some more with the splunk queries. I'll tell you right away, I'm proud of myself :P and really impressed with the whole system. The search query is very modular, easy to learn in steps. 
[11:19:39] <Krinkle> and the speed is amazing
[11:21:15] <Krinkle> And these timecharts are pretty cool, over the last 3 days I've made 5 pull requests to jquery-mobile to fix a php notice, everytime I fixed one after it was landed it goes down in the graph and another one would come up :P
