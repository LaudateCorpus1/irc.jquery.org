[17:04:31] <Krinkle> mgol: Can you edit https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Release-process to update jqueryweekly link to jqueryperiodic?
[17:10:22] <mgol> Krinkle: done. I think the weekly one can be removed completely now.
[17:10:55] <Krinkle> mgol: I've trimmed to 300 days (Feb 2016) - not sure it's useful to trim further. It's not an issue. And if someone linked it in an issue or pull somewhere, better to have it work if it's useful for someone.
[17:11:13] <Krinkle> As long as it has a cut off that we can enforce every one in a while, space doesn't run out of control.
[17:11:57] <Krinkle> mgol: k, deleting jqueryweekly
[17:12:02] <Krinkle> mgol: Did you delete qunit already?
[17:12:29] <mgol> I haven't. OK, I guess it can stay as it is.
[17:18:01] <Krinkle> I'm curius where it went then
[17:18:02] <Krinkle> it's gone from the db
[18:09:44] <Krinkle> mgol: It's under 10G now the whole testswarm db (after deleting jqueryweekly and purging to 300 days)
[18:09:47] <Krinkle> it was 25GB+
[18:10:01] <mgol> ok, cool :)
[18:10:08] <mgol> it's because the weekly job runs 3 times per week
[18:10:12] <mgol> during the night
[18:10:17] <mgol> * weekly -> periodic
[18:30:36] <Krinkle> triweekly
[18:30:42] <Krinkle> let's rename it again, shall we mgol 
[18:30:49] <mgol> :D
