[07:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: danheberden: Is the bugs.jquery.com necessary (instead of using infrastructure)? And if so, should it remain public?
[07:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Wondering if I should add a README: http://cl.ly/image/2Z0D0F2Q1I2z

[09:04:38] <Eccenux> Hi. All demo links in 1.3.2 point to http://demos/ instead of http://demos.jquerymobile.com/

[14:13:32] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf?
[14:46:23] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: sup
[15:44:57] <ryanneufeld> hey gnarf, how was your giftmas?
[15:54:49] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: s5fs: scott_gonzalez: issue 20! https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/20
[15:55:25] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: boring, "vacationed" by playing sim city mostly
[15:55:36] <ryanneufeld> nice
[15:55:51] <ryanneufeld> I spent some time yesterday working on a vm for wp-content
[15:55:56] <gnarf> nice
[15:56:39] <ryanneufeld> but I'm running into some issues with the nginx config
[15:56:47] <ryanneufeld> I 'borrowed' the manifests from the main repo
[15:56:57] <ryanneufeld> and it's complaining about the microcache log type
[15:57:08] <gnarf> um
[15:57:18] <gnarf> you can remove the "microcache" from the line
[15:57:23] <gnarf> its not really needed
[15:57:27] <ryanneufeld> ok
[15:57:39] <gnarf> it just adds cache:$no_cache_get,$no_cache_set
[15:58:12] <gnarf> honestly
[15:58:21] <gnarf> should probably get rid of microcaching in general
[15:58:25] <gnarf> its a vm
[15:58:28] <gnarf> you want live
[15:58:34] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:59:03] <gnarf> i would almost just look at the generated /etc/nginx/conf.d/vhost_autogen
[15:59:23] * gnarf shrugs
[15:59:24] <b-ot> gnarf: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[15:59:31] <gnarf> i take that back
[15:59:35] <gnarf> probably best to generate it 
[16:00:02] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: can you review that backups documentation for me?
[16:00:21] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm gonna take a look
[16:00:44] <ryanneufeld> Can you create a private repo on the jquery org?
[16:01:09] <gnarf> I can - for what purpose?
[16:01:18] <ryanneufeld> this vm
[16:01:33] <ryanneufeld> I can make it on my account
[16:01:33] <ryanneufeld> I
[16:01:41] <gnarf> um
[16:01:44] <ryanneufeld> am not sure we want it public yet is all
[16:01:51] <gnarf> repo is not a good place to store a vm imo
[16:01:56] <gnarf> dropbox?
[16:02:01] <ryanneufeld> not the vm itself
[16:02:15] <ryanneufeld> it's a vagrantfile/puppet manifests
[16:02:20] <gnarf> so um
[16:02:59] <gnarf> orphan branch on infra?
[16:03:22] <gnarf> git checkout --orphan puppet-wp-content 
[16:03:23] <gnarf> ?
[16:03:23] <ryanneufeld> I suppose i could do that
[16:03:31] <ryanneufeld> I just don
[16:03:35] <ryanneufeld> dont like doing thaty
[16:03:42] <ryanneufeld> cause it makes switching branches janky
[16:03:48] <gnarf> sure
[16:03:54] <ryanneufeld> for nowe
[16:03:57] <ryanneufeld> I can do that
[16:04:02] <ryanneufeld> i want you to see what I've got so far
[16:04:08] <ryanneufeld> for conversation sake at least
[16:04:45] <gnarf> i need to setup git@cloud.gnarf.net
[16:08:19] <ryanneufeld> this orphan branch is pissing me off now
[16:08:26] <ryanneufeld> I have to re-add all the submodules
[16:08:53] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: oh a regular old branch?
[16:08:58] <gnarf> if that works too
[16:09:54] <ryanneufeld> I made the orphan branch like you said
[16:11:31] <ryanneufeld> yeah, now it won't update or init the submodules
[16:12:07] <gnarf> sorry
[16:12:21] <gnarf> undo!
[16:12:22] <gnarf> :)
[16:12:29] <gnarf> so like
[16:12:34] <gnarf> what format was it already in?
[16:12:49] <ryanneufeld> I already have a local git repo
[16:12:54] <gnarf> okay
[16:13:08] <gnarf> push it to a branch on infra?
[16:13:37] <gnarf> git remote add infra git@github.com:jquery/infrastructure.git
[16:14:13] <gnarf> git checkout -b puppet-wp-content ; git push infra puppet-wp-content 
[16:14:14] <gnarf> ?
[16:14:21] <gnarf> then i can git clone that branch
[16:15:17] <ryanneufeld> done

[16:15:45] <ryanneufeld> the idea is to have a setup where we can just do a vagrant up
[16:15:49] <ryanneufeld> and have it build the vm
[16:16:05] <ryanneufeld> it's based off the existing jqSqueeze64 I built before
[16:17:27] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: git clone git@github.com:jquery/infrastructure.git -b puppet-wp-content puppet-wp-content
[16:17:30] <gnarf> btw
[16:17:43] <gnarf> so i dont pollute the infra submodules stuff
[16:17:44] <gnarf> :)
[16:18:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I know how to do that
[16:18:04] <ryanneufeld> :p
[16:18:15] <ryanneufeld> I just typically keep separate code bases separate :p
[16:20:07] <gnarf> yeah - just something to look at for now
[16:20:19] <gnarf> eventually, we can store this inside wp-content ?
[16:20:28] <ryanneufeld> why would we?
[16:20:39] <ryanneufeld> wp-content isn't the repo people will be using to conribute
[16:20:58] <gnarf> techinically, it is
[16:21:10] <gnarf> to have a local "jquery.com" - they need a local wp-content
[16:21:24] <ryanneufeld> which is the wp plugin
[16:21:27] <ryanneufeld> which is on the VM
[16:21:38] <ryanneufeld> but the actual content repos are different... right?
[16:22:10] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at the workflow, it doesn't say to checkout wp-content, beyond having it installed for wordpress
[16:22:25] <ryanneufeld> but my understanding of how that all works is still fairly hand wavy
[16:22:40] <gnarf> so, if you were working on jquery.com
[16:22:44] <gnarf> you have "grunt deploy"
[16:22:49] <ryanneufeld> My goal was to have the VM provide the local.?????.com
[16:22:50] <gnarf> pointing at vagrant.jquery.com
[16:22:52] <ryanneufeld> for each of them
[16:23:06] <ryanneufeld> or do we only need one instance?
[16:23:11] <gnarf> ^^^ is being run from the vagrantfile from jquery-wp-content
[16:23:51] <gnarf> you want one instance (wp-content)  
[16:23:57] <ryanneufeld> ok
[16:26:06] <ryanneufeld> oic, so when you do a grunt deploy, from any of the content repos
[16:26:17] <ryanneufeld> it pushes to the correct instance of wordpress
[16:26:23] <gnarf> it points to a single wp-content running locally - yeah
[16:26:34] <ryanneufeld> I mean, in production
[16:26:45] <ryanneufeld> I thought we had a wordpress multisite
[16:26:48] <gnarf> we do
[16:27:01] <gnarf> "single wp-content" = all of the websites
[16:27:01] <ryanneufeld> ok
[16:27:19] <ryanneufeld> single repo, or single install?
[16:27:31] <gnarf> yes and yes
[16:27:48] <ryanneufeld> got it
[16:28:58] <ryanneufeld> got time to jump on a quick skype call?
[16:30:35] <ryanneufeld> I want this ready for SanD
[16:33:45] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yeah, hangouts or skype?
[16:34:32] <ryanneufeld> skype works best
[16:34:36] <ryanneufeld> for me
[16:34:48] <ryanneufeld> call when ready
