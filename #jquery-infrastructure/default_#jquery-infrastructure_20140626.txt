[09:13:55] <jdorfman> hey this is Justin from MaxCDN
[09:15:20] <jdorfman> we received this tweet: https://twitter.com/GraphicLA/status/482141443255832576
[09:15:20] <b-ot> jdorfman: @GraphicLA: @MaxCDN @jquery We think the jQuery CDN is hacked. Have been getting spam redirects on projects using it.
[09:26:27] <gnarf> on a call ^
[10:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> jdorfman: Have you gotten any details from them yet?
[10:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> jdorfman: Nevermind, just read the email thread.
[10:19:10] <gnarf> ryanneufeld s5fs when do you want to get together tonight?

[12:07:51] <gnarf> Attn ALL: scott_gonzalez jzaefferer ajpiano s5fs jasperdegroot kborchers ryanneufeld timmywil tj_vantoll arschmitz danheberden DaveMethvin|away ---- jq01 is going to require a reboot to change IPs - all public websites will be offline briefly
[12:08:09] <ryanneufeld> Thanks for the headsup gnarf, why the IP change?
[12:08:27] <gnarf> it's primary IP is still the one being blocked at the core routers at mt
[12:08:34] <ryanneufeld> ah
[12:08:41] <ryanneufeld> that requires a reboot?
[12:08:52] <gnarf> changing primary container IP - safest
[12:09:49] <jzaefferer> Well, good thing that we haven't published the blog post yet
[12:10:57] <ryanneufeld> ifconfig eth0 <new-ip> wouldn't work gnarf?
[12:11:12] <gnarf> the (mt) tools tie in to those ips
[12:11:15] <gnarf> in like plesk, etc
[12:11:22] <gnarf> so had them switch the primary in their stuff
[12:12:40] <ryanneufeld> right, but it requires a reboot to update plex?
[12:12:47] <ryanneufeld> or is it DHCP?
[12:14:50] <gnarf> i dunno
[12:14:56] <gnarf> they said it needed a rebbot
[12:14:58] <gnarf> already done with
[12:14:59] <gnarf> painless
[12:15:09] <ryanneufeld> yeah, just seems strange to reboot a machine just to change an IP
[12:15:14] <ryanneufeld> doesn't it seem odd to you?>
[12:15:59] <gnarf> not really - having automated some of that stuff, they are changing primary IP in their internal database too
[12:16:11] <gnarf> so like, reboot container is pretty simple/easy
[12:16:21] <gnarf> and you know it wont have anything hidden/leftover
[12:16:41] <ryanneufeld> okay, just seemed odd to me
[12:18:55] <kborchers> gnarf: thanks for the heads up ... i'll just close tweetdeck for the next hour ;)
[12:22:43] <gnarf> its already back ^^^ kborchers 
[12:33:18] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: s5fs I'll be around all day for a hangout
[12:34:18] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: I'll be home around 5-6p PST for a hangout, but I'm totally free tonight (afaik)
[12:34:28] <s5fs> gnarf: ^^
[12:35:00] <gnarf> want to aim for ~5-6 pst then?
[12:35:11] <s5fs> yeah for sure!
[12:35:25] <s5fs> i'll sneak outta here a bit early (hopefully) since I got into the office at 9a like a responsible adult
[12:35:33] <s5fs> which is a PITA when you work until 2a on the daily haha!
