[09:42:12] <m_gol> s5fs gnarf ryanneufeld: bugs.jquery.com is down so it's impossible to search for old bugs
[09:42:53] <m_gol> wouldn't it be simpler to maintain if we just had static snapshots of pages for each ticket? search wouldn't work but Google should handle it by itself
[10:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: blog.jqueryui.com seems to be working fine.
[12:34:31] <gnarf> m_gol: probably - but we need to get it up to be able to snapshot it
[12:34:44] <gnarf> and once it's up, it's probably easier to just leave it up :)
[12:37:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: timmywil: y'all around - can you help me figure out if we actually need any of the plugins we have installed on http://blog.jquery.com/wp-admin/plugins.php ?
[13:14:32] <m_gol> gnarf: easier short-term ;)
