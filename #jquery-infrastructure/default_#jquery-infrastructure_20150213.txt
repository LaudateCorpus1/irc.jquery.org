[01:55:32] <rxaviers> gnarf, Hi Corey. I saw your msg about DB. I'll be online most of the day today. Feel free to ping
[04:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: What server is supposed to be deploying contribute to production?
[04:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> I though it was builder-01, but that's pointed at stage.
[04:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't seem like anything deployed to production just now when I tagged.
[04:50:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: they moved a bunch of this stuff last night
[04:50:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think they broke it.
[04:50:42] <arschmitz> we did some test depolys on some sites but not contribute
[04:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> To production?
[04:50:54] <arschmitz> yup
[04:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know which server you used?
[04:51:27] <arschmitz> i depolyed api.jquerymobile.com just by tagging regularly
[04:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> Because it looks like everything on builder-01 goes to stage.
[04:51:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll check my emails.
[04:51:50] <arschmitz> thats what i was just going to do 
[04:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> That was builder-01.
[04:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> And that's definitely pointed at stage.
[04:53:02] <arschmitz> hmm apparently we didnt REALLY check this
[04:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently ;-)
[04:53:17] <arschmitz> because it did not actually update production
[04:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think anything can deploy to production right now.
[04:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> And zabbix configs aren't in the repo.
[04:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, guess I'll just have to wait for one of them to be around.
[04:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you know how to fix this.
[04:54:37] <arschmitz> nope sorry
[04:54:55] <arschmitz> im not sure all of what they did i got pulld in half way through
[04:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[04:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> Guess it's time to go do my workout then :-)
[04:55:30] <arschmitz> might be a good time
[06:45:23] <gnarf> s5fs: why was that setup in environment=stage?
[06:45:24] <gnarf> fixing
[06:46:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: fixing the deploy
[06:46:08] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[06:46:10] <gnarf> done
[06:46:26] <gnarf> s5fs scott_gonzalez: fyi --- environment=stage in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf was the culprit
[06:46:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: try a new tag for the hell of it please?
[06:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[06:48:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you know if ui's download builder will work from behind cloudflare?
[06:48:46] <gnarf> Can I try turning it on?
[06:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[06:49:53] <gnarf> well i just tried turning it on
[06:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Deploy worked
[06:49:58] <gnarf> and flipping to the new builder
[06:50:19] <gnarf> if anything breaks, holla
[06:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Seems to be working.
[07:00:15] <gnarf> agree
[07:00:28] <gnarf> gonna leave it keep an eye out for download builder problems tho
[07:01:13] <gnarf> s5fs: i think we can offically kill jq02 now
[08:27:41] <s5fs> gnarf: oh forgot to remove it is all
[08:29:26] <s5fs> nothing intentional :D
[08:30:04] <s5fs> gnarf: I think the 'origin' server is good too, it serves files
[08:31:56] <s5fs> not sure how else to test it
[08:32:31] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: sorry about breaking stuffs
[08:36:20] <s5fs> Okay, 'content.origin.jquery.com' and 'static.origin.jquery.com' have been moved to a new server and tucked behind cloudflare.
[08:36:27] <s5fs> holler if I broke more stuff lolol
[08:39:33] <gnarf> s5fs: did you point maxcdn at the static ip?
[08:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: no problem
[08:56:55] <s5fs> gnarf: yeah i'm still digging on where to set that up
[09:06:52] <s5fs> gnarf: maxcdn is updated and cloudflare enabled
[09:07:04] <s5fs> should be good to go, holler if issues gang :)
