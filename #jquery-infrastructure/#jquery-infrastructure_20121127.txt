[11:54:18] <Krinkle> gnarf: jzaefferer: browserstack is becoming more unreliable by the day, this is unacceptable
[11:54:24] <Krinkle> not a single build completed over the last 2 days.

[11:54:38] <Krinkle> check those
[11:55:12] <Krinkle> 229/236 safari 6 dead
[11:55:17] <Krinkle> 89/119 ie7 dead
[11:55:33] <Krinkle> do they have tests for their API, or are we just doing it wrong !?
[13:09:36] <Krinkle> clarkbox: regarding GUID, that's something for TestSwarm Nodejs/Next. Doesn't make sense yet in the current model as there is no way to enforce it to be retreived first.
[13:09:46] <Krinkle> Unless you want to do it the milky way
[13:10:28] <Krinkle> as in, append meaningless parameters to the run page url, unbeknownst to TestSwarm. 
[13:10:46] <Krinkle> clarkbox: As for current correlation, we use swarmstate
[13:11:01] <Krinkle> I thought you know, I mean, that's what we use to terminate the workers.
[13:11:09] <Krinkle> onlineClients===0, status===running
[13:11:25] <Krinkle> As soon as the run page is hit, inlineClients !== 0
[13:11:32] <Krinkle> online*
[13:12:27] <Krinkle> if you suspect that might be inaccurate, I guess all we can use is raw nginx access logs for swarm.jquery.org/run/browserstack*
[13:13:30] <Krinkle> gnarf: gnarf: HP Notice:  session_start(): ps_files_cleanup_dir: opendir(/var/lib/php5) failed: Permission denied (13) in /var/www/swarm/index.ph
[13:18:47] <Krinkle> clarkbox: Hm.. Why is https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20source%3D%22%2Fvar%2Flog%2Fnginx%2Fswarm.jquery.org.access.log%22 not indexed?
[13:59:01] <clarkbox> crinkle, the guid will let us track the status of a spawned worker
[14:03:33] <clarkbox> krinkle
[14:04:23] <clarkbox> i had a feeling we were not indexing that
[14:04:46] <clarkbox> we had to trim out some stuff, as we were getting too much noise. i need to whitelist hosts that we index
[14:05:05] <clarkbox> so i will add swarm.jquery 
[14:05:45] <clarkbox> back to the guid… its lets us know that a worker we spawned hit the run page
[14:06:41] <clarkbox> if browserstack inserted the workerID in a host header - we could use that
[14:07:07] <clarkbox> i mean, "request header" not "host header"
[14:15:58] <gnarf> yeah, we could add that to the nginx access log too
[14:20:33] <clarkbox> gnarf: can you elaborate?
[14:20:51] <gnarf> the guid /client id
[14:21:20] <clarkbox> we have o do something to get it to log a querystring value? or you mean pull it out of the header?
[14:21:31] <gnarf> if it's a request header, i'm pretty sure we could add it to the nginx access log
[14:21:36] <clarkbox> ahh
[14:22:12] <clarkbox> ya that would be ideal. but i don't think browserstack will be able to -easily- add that to a req header
[14:26:22] <gnarf> well, we could add it to the query string for the run page, and from there add it to the headers
[14:32:02] <clarkbox> well from inside the browser, we do not know the worker ID
[14:32:09] <clarkbox> but we could propagate the GUID
[14:32:32] <clarkbox> but from splunks prospective its all the same.
[14:32:58] <clarkbox> we can get the GUID from the referer header
[15:45:39] <clarkbox> ok we now have access logs for swarm.jquery.org in splunk
[15:49:19] <clarkbox> gnarf krinkle ^
[15:49:35] <Krinkle> clarkbox: isn't that auto discovered?
[15:49:42] <clarkbox> no
[15:49:52] <clarkbox> by default it is
[15:49:58] <clarkbox> but we have set up a whitelist
[16:16:28] <Krinkle> clarkbox: ok
[16:16:29] <Krinkle> clarkbox: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20source%3D%22%2Fvar%2Flog%2Fnginx%2Fswarm.jquery.org.access.log%22%20%22GET%20%2Frun%2Fbrowserstack%3Frun_token%3D*%22
[16:16:32] <Krinkle> Nice
[16:16:46] <clarkbox> ya
[16:16:53] <Krinkle> ua-parser in splunk ?
[16:16:54] <Krinkle> :P
[16:16:56] <clarkbox> also found a 404 for a css file (not a big deal)
[16:17:04] <clarkbox> you can build an app for that :)
[16:17:10] <Krinkle> no thanks
[16:17:24] <Krinkle> anyhow, general numbers is enough I imagine
[16:17:35] <Krinkle> now we need to correlate that to action=spawn
[16:17:44] <Krinkle> clarkbox: Do you know how to do that between different sources?
[16:18:28] <Krinkle> the graph that should follow is two lines on 1 chart, one a few seconds/minutes behind the other (one for spawns, the other the hits)
[16:18:42] <clarkbox> ya
[16:19:02] <clarkbox> we will need to add that guid to the querystring (and ts-bs log)
[16:19:09] <clarkbox> to make it easier
[16:20:19] <Krinkle> We don't need to match individual ones
[16:20:23] <Krinkle> the script already does that
[16:20:28] <Krinkle> by terminiating ghosted workers
[16:20:38] <Krinkle> we just need the overal count of spawns and run page hits
[16:20:43] <clarkbox> sure
[16:20:59] <clarkbox> i gotta run for now
[16:21:02] <Krinkle> ok
[16:21:20] <Krinkle> ah [join]
[16:21:22] <Krinkle> interesting
[16:21:28] <clarkbox> will be back on later tonight - ill see if i can find some time to work on this
[16:21:36] <clarkbox> however, i think its on BS side
[16:21:40] <clarkbox> look at status codes
[16:21:41] <clarkbox> 499
[16:21:59] <clarkbox> thats nginx client terminate status
[16:22:35] <clarkbox> guess what browsers are giving that?
[16:22:36] <Krinkle> yeah
[16:22:59] <Krinkle> but those are for referring requests though, not the initial hit
[16:23:00] <clarkbox> oh… i see at least one chrome in there
[16:23:09] <Krinkle> yeah, all of them have ghosts
[16:23:13] <clarkbox> anyway
[16:23:15] <Krinkle> some more than others
[16:23:20] <clarkbox> I'm out for now
[16:23:22] <Krinkle> k
[16:33:04] <Krinkle> gnarf: I fixed the "ps_files_cleanup_dir: opendir(/var/lib/php5) failed:" errors by setting session.gc_probability = 0 (instead of 1) in etc/php5/fpm/php.ini
[16:33:13] <Krinkle> Looks like it was misset or copied from elsewhere
[16:33:26] <Krinkle> on Ubuntu only the cronjob has permission to clean it up
[16:33:48] <Krinkle> session.gc_probability is a way for php to do it in 1/1000 requests instead, but we should disable that since we have the cron already
[16:33:54] <Krinkle> http://somethingemporium.com/2007/06/obscure-error-with-php5-on-debian-ubuntu-session-phpini-garbage
[16:33:55] <Krinkle> fixed now
[16:33:56] <gnarf> yeah
[16:34:01] <gnarf> makes sense
[16:34:24] <gnarf> add it to the session.ini rather than edit the php.ini
[16:34:25] <gnarf> safer
[16:34:42] <Krinkle> hm.. ok
[16:34:50] <Krinkle> can you explain?
[16:35:18] <gnarf> i use the conf.d because then we can just puppet that file to everything
[16:35:26] <Krinkle> right
[16:35:27] <gnarf> and not worry about editing the php.ini
[16:35:31] <Krinkle> in which order is it included
[16:35:37] <Krinkle> is it puppetized now?
[16:35:39] <gnarf> no
[16:35:43] <gnarf> not session.ini
[16:35:46] <gnarf> i haven't added it yet
[16:35:52] <gnarf> going to tho, and sync it to everything
[16:36:08] <gnarf> i think the last line of php.ini includes the conf.d
[16:36:10] <gnarf> just look
[16:38:01] <gnarf> i don't know where its defined
[16:38:02] <gnarf> sorry
[16:38:04] <Krinkle> added to session.ini
[16:38:09] <gnarf> pretty sure the conf.d comes after tho
[16:38:16] <Krinkle> it better
[16:38:37] <gnarf> might even be compiled in
[16:39:07] <Krinkle> I don't see it mentioned anywhere
[16:39:15] <Krinkle> 0 matches in /etc/php5
[16:39:20] <gnarf> Configuration File (php.ini) Path => /etc/php5/cli
[16:39:20] <gnarf> Loaded Configuration File => /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
[16:39:20] <gnarf> Scan this dir for additional .ini files => /etc/php5/cli/conf.d
[16:39:25] <Krinkle> yeah
[16:39:26] <gnarf> from phpinfo()
[16:39:44] <Krinkle> wait, /cli/conf.d ?
[16:39:53] <gnarf> its a symlink back to conf.d
[16:39:56] <Krinkle> ah, i see
[17:28:43] <Krinkle> clarkbox: easier than I thought: (source=... ... ) OR (source=... ... ) | timechart count by source
[17:29:01] <Krinkle> there is also an explicit join command, but this seems much simpler
[17:29:02] <Krinkle> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/browserstack
[17:29:35] <Krinkle> "Spawns and TestSwarm clients" so far it matches up with the access logs (from the part where there is data)
[22:14:57] <clarkbox> krinke that is beautiful 
[22:16:25] <Krinkle> thx
[22:16:34] <clarkbox> i think a bar chart is better viz
[22:16:52] <clarkbox> line you can't easily see, and the interface won't let you mouse pver to see
[22:17:00] <Krinkle> i agree
[22:17:03] <clarkbox> with side by side bars, per day, its clear
[22:17:06] <clarkbox> ill change it
[22:17:10] <Krinkle> ok
[22:17:22] <Krinkle> btw, see trending errors
[22:17:25] <Krinkle> there's a few odd errors
[22:17:29] <Krinkle> probably on the browserstack side
[22:17:39] <Krinkle> since we don't have an events.js file
[22:17:53] <Krinkle> their api even served html at some point
[22:18:21] <clarkbox> done. i meant column.
[22:18:31] <clarkbox> not bar chart
[22:18:39] <clarkbox> brb
