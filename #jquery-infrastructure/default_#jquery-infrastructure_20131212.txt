[10:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> Who's around?
[10:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> I think we've got a broken nginx config.
[10:32:22] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/search.php is 404ing
[10:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> But it exists.
[10:33:33] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i'll look into it shortly
[10:33:36] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[10:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: I just filed an issue, but it won't let me assign it to you :-P https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/65
[10:37:41] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: that's a feature ;)
[10:37:55] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:38:40] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: where is this page linked from?
[10:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/remote.html
[10:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> Or, for the standard view of that page: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[10:40:02] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: perfect, i see it now, thanks
[10:43:02] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: I don't appear to have a WP acct, would you be able to set that up?
[10:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody has an account.
[10:43:26] <s5fs> oh okay
[10:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> Hold on a sec.
[10:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> There must have been a somewhat recent change, because this demo has existed for a long time.
[10:50:18] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: yeah, it works over ssl but not unsecured
[10:51:13] <s5fs> well, it doesn't 404 at least
[10:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[10:54:40] <s5fs> over ssl it doesn't seem to work though (the demo page, that is)
[10:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that doesn't really concern me. Unless we decide to actually support (not just technically enable) HTTPS on all sites, I'm fine just telling people not to use HTTPS for jqueryui.com.
[10:57:06] <s5fs> gotcha
[10:58:03] <s5fs> brb customer
[13:05:17] <gnarf> hrm
[13:05:55] <s5fs> gnarf: i wanna chat about how you're debugging this. i don't know much about the current wp setup wrt puppet. am i even looking at the right files, etc? haha
[13:06:03] <gnarf> well first off
[13:06:08] <gnarf> http://stage.jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/search.php?term=a 
[13:06:09] <gnarf> works
[13:06:12] <gnarf> so does https
[13:06:21] <s5fs> very interesting
[13:06:29] <gnarf> but https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/search.php?term=a works, but not http
[13:06:54] <s5fs> right
[13:07:56] <s5fs> testing stage is a good suggestion, but it's also in the same jqueryui.pp file yes?
[13:08:30] <gnarf> yup
[13:08:34] <gnarf> theoretically the same config
[13:08:47] <s5fs> yeah, i should read up on the wp module we're using i guess :)
[13:09:37] <gnarf> so at this point
[13:09:41] <gnarf> since stage can't repro
[13:09:49] <gnarf> it gets really tough to figure out
[13:09:56] <gnarf> step 1: restart nginx just to make sure :)
[13:10:39] <s5fs> okay cool, i wasn't seeing anything obvious :)
[13:10:46] <gnarf> yeah, no luck here
[13:10:49] <gnarf> so step 2
[13:10:58] <s5fs> time to read some logs 
[13:11:01] <gnarf> enable the firehose by adding "debug;" to the end of the log
[13:11:33] <s5fs> where is that configured?
[13:12:04] <gnarf> check hangouts, i'll screenshare
[13:12:14] <s5fs> roger

[13:27:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think we've fixed that problem
[13:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, confirmed.
[13:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be honest, I have no idea what the commit does :-P
[13:29:51] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i can't interact w/that gh issue you created, feel free to close it out :)
[13:29:54] <s5fs> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/65
[13:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> Closed. Thanks.
[13:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: It's a feature :-P
[13:30:42] <s5fs> happy to help, maybe next time i'll take my training wheels off and make gnarf proud ;)
[13:30:53] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: indeed haha!
[13:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> So, gnarf, do we care about requiring joins for messages?
[13:31:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: IMO - All IRC channels should be +n
[13:31:58] <gnarf> means we can ban spammers
[13:32:08] <scott_gonzalez> You can't ban someone if they're not in the channel?
[13:32:18] <gnarf> you can, but they aren't in the channel
[13:32:26] <gnarf> so your client makes it a pain in the ass
[13:32:31] <gnarf> whereas, i can right click ban you
[13:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> meh
[13:32:40] <s5fs> hah nice
[13:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> Seems so infrequent that it's a non-issue.
[13:32:54] <gnarf> until it is
[13:33:05] <gnarf> then you have to go +n and etc
[13:33:15] <gnarf> but why not just hide join/part?
[13:33:15] * scott_gonzalez slaps gnarf
[13:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> Let's battle.
[13:33:24] <s5fs> slap battle?
[13:33:32] <s5fs> i hide joins/parts
[13:33:35] <gnarf> ;)
[13:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I didn't want to actually kick or ban him
[13:33:47] <gnarf> don't leave scott!
[13:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:34:01] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:34:05] <gnarf> shhh
[13:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> shh yourself
[13:34:11] <gnarf> i wonder if @ can talk over +q
[13:34:17] <gnarf> thanks for answering that
[13:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> no problem ;-)
[13:34:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we can keep the join/parts if you think it's important.
[13:34:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: honestly people who have their shit set to change nick when away are more lines of spam than join/part from irc bots
[13:34:59] <s5fs> concur
[13:35:02] <gnarf> i think +n is important(ish)
[13:35:24] <gnarf> gseguin and DaveMethvin are usually all I see in a quiet channel
[13:36:04] <gnarf> nick change on away so annoying I can actually tell you the two nicks that seem to use it ;)
[13:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> I agree that in general the join/part is annoying, but I find them useful too often to remove them.
[13:36:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i have them silenced because I still do the #jquery support thing now and then
[13:36:33] <gnarf> and join/part in #jquery is SPAMMMMMMMMM
[13:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...seems like clients should support hiding that per channel.
[13:36:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think i could 
[13:37:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its just html
[13:37:29] <gnarf> though i don't know if there is a [data-channel="#jquery"] 
[13:37:30] <gnarf> for the theme
[13:37:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i know for a fact in textual you can silence join/part per nickname
[13:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, if we're not adding skip_join: true to .travis.yml, it's probably not worth going through all the projects to change the template.
[13:40:31] <uGoMobi> gnarf s5fs: we were discussing the demos for Mobile on jqueryui-dev
[13:40:32] <scott_gonzalez> Though I do think my custom template reads much better.
[13:41:06] <uGoMobi> gnarf s5fs: we would like to move the demos to demos.jquerymobile.com
[13:41:41] <uGoMobi> is that something you can set up for us?
[13:41:50] <gnarf> hrm
[13:41:56] <gnarf> versioned?
[13:41:59] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:42:02] <gnarf> how?
[13:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> It can probably just be a standard PHP site (it's not WordPress).
[13:42:17] <uGoMobi> demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/
[13:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> They're just going to dump the demos from each version of jquery-mobile into it.
[13:42:42] <gnarf> uGoMobi: where does that data come from?
[13:42:52] <gnarf> is there a git repo to control it?
[13:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/demos
[13:43:00] <uGoMobi> gnarf: no
[13:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> There will be.
[13:43:08] <uGoMobi> gnarf: we build the demos
[13:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> We'll create demos.jquerymobile.com
[13:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> And they'll populate it with each release.
[13:43:39] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: but we use a build script for the demos
[13:43:44] <gnarf> branches as Top level directories?
[13:43:56] <uGoMobi> so we manually put them on the server
[13:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: versions as top level directories
[13:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> No branches
[13:44:04] <gnarf> uGoMobi: -2
[13:44:23] <gnarf> uGoMobi: "manually put on server" =  I say no- you do it via a build/grunt/deploy if we can
[13:44:39] <gnarf> automated / easy to rebuild - no keys required
[13:44:44] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> What does the build script do?
[13:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think this needs grunt deploy. It's sort of like download builder, but simpler.
[13:45:08] <uGoMobi> converting PHP stuf to HTML
[13:45:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so git repo = public_html folder basically?
[13:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: But that happens prior to you putting the files there, right?
[13:45:39] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: yes
[13:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> Like, the demos are working on view.jquerymobile.com.
[13:45:51] <gnarf> build locally, push to git repo, it deploys
[13:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[13:45:57] <gnarf> so
[13:46:02] <gnarf> how is the index page generated?
[13:46:07] <gnarf> is this like codeorigin somehow?
[13:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose it could be.
[13:46:35] <uGoMobi> the demos on view.* are not a build
[13:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> But that's what you're pointing people to now.
[13:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> So what's the difference between those and the built version?
[13:47:03] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: no, we point to /dist/ directory
[13:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, right.
[13:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll just run the build, then move the files over to the demos.jquerymobile.com repo.
[13:47:30] <gnarf> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0-alpha.1/dist/demos/ ?
[13:47:37] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: the demos are also added to the release zip
[13:47:47] <uGoMobi> so we have to make them work locally
[13:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yes, demos.jquerymobile.com will just be a collection of /dist/demos/ from each version.
[13:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Is that an accurate summary?
[13:48:42] <gnarf> so, my concern is the "index page" - perhaps we just redirect demos.jquerymobile.com/ to jquerymobile.com/demos and put an index page there?
[13:48:43] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: yes, that is correct
[13:49:01] <gnarf> avoid having to have another wp-content site for demos
[13:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this won't be wp-content.
[13:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> The infrastructure is much simpler.
[13:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a public_html site like you said.
[13:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> Redirecting / to jquerymobile.com/demos/ seems fine.
[13:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> But I think it's also fine to have demos.jquerymobile.com/ be an actual page that isn't wp-content themed.
[13:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> Since the rest of the site won't be wp-content themed.
[13:51:12] <gseguin> or just redirect demos.jquerymobile.com/ to the latest release of the demos
[13:51:21] <gnarf> ^ 
[13:51:23] <gnarf> +1
[13:51:26] <uGoMobi> yeah, and we have /pages/demos.html to link to all versions
[13:51:48] <gnarf> seems doable
[13:52:14] <gseguin> so we do a redirect via meta in the index.html? 
[13:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> nginx redirect
[13:52:28] <gnarf> i'd rather write an nginx 
[13:52:37] <gseguin> how can you automate it?
[13:52:50] <gnarf> change a line in puppet
[13:53:18] <gseguin> can I do that as part of the release script?
[13:53:58] <gnarf> maybe, this side convo makes me lean back to "index of versions" page
[13:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> Or just don't have the redirect.
[13:54:47] <scott_gonzalez> Whether the index is auto-generated or manually maintained seems irrelevant to the puppet config.
[13:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> So that's just a choice for the Mobile team to make.
[13:55:16] <scott_gonzalez> Whether they want to take the time to write an automated index generator or just add a few lines manually each time.
[13:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> But not having the redirect gets us a consistent puppet config.
[13:55:54] <gseguin> All that the index would contain would be a meta redirect to the latest version
[13:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> That is another option.
[13:56:36] <gseguin> I'm fine with either, I just want to make sure that it's doable via the release script
[13:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's not great.
[13:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> But it's not terrible.
[13:56:47] <gnarf> I've been under the impression that meta redirect went the way of the dodo like 7 years ago :) -- At least thats when I started treating it as bad practice
[13:56:54] <s5fs> ^
[13:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, I wouldn't actually do a meta redirect.
[13:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'd use a PHP header.
[13:57:23] <scott_gonzalez> But it'd be managed via the content, not via the web server.
[13:57:36] <gnarf> yeah
[13:57:47] <gnarf> header("Location: ") doesn't bug me
[13:57:47] <scott_gonzalez> <?php header( "Location: /1.4.0/" );
[13:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> done
[13:59:13] <gseguin> ok then I just have to replace that string in the release script once I've added the demo and push and BOOM
[13:59:24] <gseguin> works for me
[13:59:30] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[14:00:52] <uGoMobi> we probably also need some redirects to prevent broken links in search results for the demos of previous versions
[14:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, we can handle that in nginx.
[14:01:09] <uGoMobi> although... view.* is blocked so I am not even sure they are listed
[14:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we'll only want to redirect jquerymobile.com/demos/.
[14:02:02] <uGoMobi> right
[14:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> That'll be an easy redirect, since the paths the same same.
[14:02:20] <uGoMobi> for some reason Google keeps showing the 1.2 demos as first result :(
[14:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> jquerymobile.com/demos/* -> demos.jquerymobile.com/*
[14:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> Whew, now that we've got that all settled, time to work on DEBT.
[14:04:40] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok, won't disturb you any longer... I want DEBT too :)
[14:04:50] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez gnarf gseguin : thanks!
