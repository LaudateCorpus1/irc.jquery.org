[06:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We've got a broken check!
[06:53:22] <gnarf> ?
[06:53:25] <gnarf> howd it break?
[13:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Just FYI, I killed my script, so puppet should kick off a proper one again.
[13:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still working on the fix, but at least I know the problem.
[13:22:09] <gnarf> cool
[13:22:15] <gnarf> what was it?
[13:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> Somehow the base commit isn't in the PR branch.
[13:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand how that's possible.
[13:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[13:41:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thinking about how that could even be possible hurts my head
[13:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. Does anyone know someone who might be able to explain it to me?
[13:42:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: MAYBE tbranyen
[13:43:01] <gnarf> but like
[13:43:16] <gnarf> github does some seriously wacky shit with thier refs/pr/ shit
[13:43:24] <gnarf> total non-standard abuses
[13:43:45] <gnarf> last time i asked about a github specific git thing
[13:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> I assumed it was just a local copy of the remote branch.
[13:43:53] <gnarf> he was like "*shrug* github"
[13:44:03] <gnarf> it >should< be
[13:44:10] <gnarf> but i think when you fetch it
[13:44:17] <gnarf> it doesn't also fetch the base
[13:44:22] <gnarf> somehow
[13:44:32] <gnarf> nonstandard githubified interface
[13:45:17] <gnarf> like it delivers it in a .pack that only contains the pr 
[13:49:20] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i keep looking at the bad one and others looking for ANYTHING different and i dont see anything
[13:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> If you're just looking on GitHub, you're not going to find anything.
[13:50:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i was looking at the git historys of local clones looking for something different
[13:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well the difference is that the base commits don't exist in the clones.
[13:51:20] <arschmitz> right im trying to see if i can see something different for WHY
[13:52:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i cant imagine its random 
[13:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/markelog/jquery/commits/059befe1df94cf6ffc3c0060ee745e294afea9f0
[13:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/master
[13:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> That third commit in master is the base.
[13:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't exist in the PR branch.
[13:56:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah thats the one i was checking out
[13:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> My question is why is that the base instead of the parent of that commit being the base?
[13:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose that's just git.
[13:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> But it means both branches need to be fetched in order to have a valid range.
[13:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> So the difference is probably just that this PR is behind master.
[13:58:03] <scott_gonzalez> And the other PRs aren't.
[13:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> I bet if he rebases, the error will go away.
[14:03:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i thought of that
[14:03:48] <arschmitz> but i found one that passed that was 75 commits behind
[14:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> But that was probably on a repo that was cloned recently enough to contain the base.
[14:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> We fetch master once, and that's during the first PR when we clone.
