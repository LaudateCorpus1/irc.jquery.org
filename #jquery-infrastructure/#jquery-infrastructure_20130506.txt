[11:18:21] <clarkbox> gnarf or ryanneufeld: can you pint s5fs to the vagrant doc?
[11:18:28] <clarkbox> *point
[11:20:44] <clarkbox> â€¦ he needs to spin up the plugins site
[11:34:09] <gnarf> i showed him how to start those up the other day, spinning up the whole site can be a bit obtuse though
[11:34:33] <gnarf> can probably just work on staging.plugins.jquery.com 
[12:59:05] <s5fs> :)
[13:30:48] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! I'm wondering if you guys know where I might find some documentation about the req parameter of a grunt-contrib-connect middleware callback.
[13:31:07] <_|Nix|_> In particular, I'm trying to create a github push-hook.
[13:31:25] <_|Nix|_> So, I'm getting a POST with a bunch of data, but I dunno where that data is.
[13:31:56] <_|Nix|_> I've tried wading through the enormous) req parameter, but I haven't found the data set in any object.
[13:32:22] <_|Nix|_> Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough, but I can't find any documentation about the req object either.
[13:38:24] <s5fs> _|Nix|_: it's not in req.body?
[13:39:12] <s5fs> _|Nix|_: that's where I'd look if this were plain ol' node.js biz, not sure if req is munged by someone else along the way though.
[13:42:37] <_|Nix|_> s5fs: Thanks!
[13:43:00] <_|Nix|_> s5fs: I'll have a look. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4295782/how-do-you-extract-post-data-in-node-js suggests that I have to assemble the body myself.
[13:45:33] <_|Nix|_> s5fs: Got it! That SO question nailed it for me.
[13:45:36] <s5fs> _|Nix|_: yeah sorry, I'm more familiar with connect and express, makes working with node's http much more manageable.
[13:46:02] <s5fs> nice!
[13:46:30] <_|Nix|_> s5fs: Well, if it's something I can quickly throw in with connect, then I'd love to.
[13:46:51] <s5fs> _|Nix|_: what did you end up using, querystring?
[13:48:31] <_|Nix|_> s5fs: Yes.
[13:50:11] <s5fs> _|Nix|_: cool. if you're already using connect, you can prob get away with just using bodyParser then.
[13:51:27] <s5fs> http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/bodyParser.html
[13:51:53] <_|Nix|_> s5fs: Oh, is that one of those middlewares?
[13:52:31] <s5fs> yeah, connect is 'the' middleware for http stuffs (afaik). tons of stuff is built on it, including express.
