[07:10:05] <DaveMethvin> i seem to be unable to flush the cdn cache for a file ... am i doing this right?  http://codeorigin.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js?reload
[07:10:14] <DaveMethvin> it says it's flushing
[07:13:34] <DaveMethvin> gnarf ryanneufeld  s5fs  any ideas?
[07:13:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://codeorigin.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js?view
[07:14:07] <gnarf> pretty sure thats not the file you're trying to serve? :)
[07:14:54] <DaveMethvin> oh let me try the actual file
[07:15:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I think there is a clash 
[07:15:37] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so the -latest version used to be hinding in the "git" folder
[07:16:18] <gnarf> yeah
[07:16:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you want to use the one from cdn now yeah
[07:16:45] <DaveMethvin> how did it get aliased to there?
[07:17:13] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so when I set up this codeorigin there is a "git" folder that is where jenkins pushes the git builds
[07:17:45] <DaveMethvin> ok, so that way jenkins doesn't need to mess with the rest of the cdn
[07:17:49] <gnarf> yeah
[07:17:51] <gnarf> or commit to the repo
[07:17:54] <gnarf> or anything like that
[07:18:00] <gnarf> so anything in that git folder is just kinda raw
[07:18:07] <gnarf> i can delete all the *-latest* files from that folder
[07:18:11] <gnarf> and it will prolly fix your problem
[07:18:17] <DaveMethvin> well give that a try
[07:18:23] <gnarf> and fall back down to using the cdn/ folder
[07:18:31] <DaveMethvin> worst that happens is that we break every site in the world using jquery-latest.js
[07:18:32] <DaveMethvin> :)
[07:18:43] <DaveMethvin> THEY DESERVE IT
[07:18:51] <gnarf> yeah http://codeorigin.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js?view is 1.11.1 now
[07:19:03] <DaveMethvin> awesome!
[07:19:09] <DaveMethvin> i'm doing that blog post in a sec 
[07:19:15] <DaveMethvin> just wanted to make sure it was up to date
[07:19:15] <gnarf> probably want to destroy the cache on all these files: git/jquery-latest.js   git/jquery-latest.min.js   git/jquery-latest.pack.js   git/jquery-latest-vsdocs.js git/jquery-latest.jss  git/jquery-latest.min.map  git/jquery-latest-release.js
[07:19:36] <DaveMethvin> ugh, the map files
[07:19:55] <DaveMethvin> i think i'll just remove them
