[12:26:59] <clarkbox> krinkle, you around
[12:27:26] <clarkbox> just looking at merging this pull request to upgrade to browserstack 2.0 api
[12:28:36] <clarkbox> that is, the pull request for testswarm-browserstack
[13:32:30] <Krinkle> clarkbox: I'm getting notifications for that repo :) I've looked at it.
[13:32:40] <Krinkle> I didn't expect v2 API to be so easy to implement
[13:32:59] <Krinkle> because the /browsers map has changed in the API from a flat list to a multi-level object
[13:33:07] <Krinkle> however it appears the /worker target is still flat.
[13:33:15] <Krinkle> which is even worse, but does work in our advantage in this case
[13:33:21] <Krinkle> very simple to implement.
[13:33:32] <Krinkle> If it works, we can just merge it.
[13:35:51] <Krinkle> clarkbox: I'm currently tying up various loose ends on other repos and sprint projects (just got back from a hackathon-week). If you want, I can test it later this week.
[13:35:52] <clarkbox> ya its not really working as is
[13:35:59] <clarkbox> i need to do some more work to get it done
[13:36:01] <Krinkle> ah, it isn't?
[13:36:17] <Krinkle> what isn't working?
[13:36:18] <clarkbox> the very problem you are highlighting seems to be taking place
[13:36:25] <Krinkle> ok
[13:36:43] <Krinkle> Hm.. interesting
[13:36:49] <clarkbox> it is endlessly queuing workers as specified by swarm-state endpoint
[13:37:06] <clarkbox> regardless if they have running or queued status
[13:37:26] <clarkbox> anyway, I'm about 10% the way in to the problem, and will see if i can fix it in the next day or two
[13:45:16] <Krinkle> ok, I'll look out for a comment on the pr :)
[13:49:12] <clarkbox> i think this may have been the culprit for browserstacks DDOS last weeks
[13:49:30] <clarkbox> they mentioned a single user had gone crazy, requesting workers endlessly
[13:49:36] <clarkbox> which is exactly what this revision does
[13:49:43] <Krinkle> I'm not sure I follow
[13:49:44] <clarkbox> haha. coincidence?
[13:49:51] <Krinkle> you mean the PR or master?
[13:49:56] <clarkbox> the PR
[13:50:27] <Krinkle> I know that browserstack has been having issues with workers not running (stuck on status 'queue').
[13:50:37] <Krinkle> in v1 API anyway.
[13:50:49] <Krinkle> sometimes a worker randomly takes an hour to go running
[13:51:34] <Krinkle> but for all I know it is a chicken-egg problem. Workers could be stalled due to load, or it could be the cause itself (and users with other scripts that keep starting new ones and thus create that very load)
[13:51:38] <clarkbox> in browserstack's reply to your inquiry on the status of things on oct 30th… they replied "There were too many items (1000+) in worker queue. Someone else's code
[13:51:38] <clarkbox> went mad. I have fixed it now."
[13:52:09] <clarkbox> ya… just a thought. anyway, ill keep you posted
[13:52:11] <Krinkle> clarkbox: Did you try --verbose to see what is going wrong?
[13:52:27] <clarkbox> ya
[13:52:38] <Krinkle> I'll resist to merge it locally. keep me posted :)
[13:53:14] <clarkbox> ya, i have a few other things i need to tend to through today/tomorrow. but with luck ill have a push soon
[13:58:01] <Krinkle> cool
