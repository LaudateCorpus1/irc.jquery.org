[21:01:37] <s5fs> nginx on jq01 is messed up again
[21:02:22] <s5fs> i have four processes i cannot kill
[21:04:21] <s5fs> gnarf: ping
[21:04:29] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: ping
[21:04:33] <s5fs> okay i'm rebooting
[21:12:14] <s5fs> jq01 won't reboot, sweet
[21:30:02] <s5fs> okay so MT says the host is being backed up and that's why I can't restart it
[21:31:45] <s5fs> so i've been instructed to wait a half hour before attempting to restart it again
[21:45:08] <s5fs> i think the reboot has started, it killed my session and my ping died
[22:16:10] <ajpiano> shitshit
[22:16:20] <s5fs> ajpiano: hi
