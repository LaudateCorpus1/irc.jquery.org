[08:02:40] <mgol> gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld: did you see my e-mail?
[08:03:21] <mgol> I see all of the others are here... Are all the sites/services just broken for me? :/
[08:12:19] <mzgol> this is my work btw, did I get cut out by a spam filter or sth? ;)
[08:26:21] <gnarf> mzgol not sure - did it start working again, or are you still blocked?
[08:27:05] <mzgol> gnarf: still blocked
[08:27:16] <mzgol> it doesn't work by IP either so it's not DNS
[08:27:19] <gnarf> whats the public ip / where does the traceroute end?
[08:27:26] <mzgol> reconnecting to my company network doesn't help
[08:27:44] <mzgol> public IP: 178.42.59.141
[08:27:50] <mzgol> I'll try traceroute in a moment
[08:28:36] <gnarf> it appears as though something at (mt) is blocking you
[08:28:52] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf/586ea63ee514aeb58959
[08:30:13] <mzgol> at least code.jquery.com works for me
[08:30:51] <mzgol> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/5eQg3qw6
[08:33:15] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: br01-1-1.lax4.netdc.com I don' think that's a MT service is it?
[08:33:46] <gnarf> well one of two things
[08:33:59] <gnarf> its the interconnect just upstream
[08:34:05] <gnarf> and there is a disconnect
[08:35:02] <gnarf> my trace from bocoup's crappy connection looks like this: 
[08:35:03] <gnarf> 12  br01-1-1.lax4.netdc.com (64.93.64.154)  94.909 ms *  104.201 ms
[08:35:03] <gnarf> 13  mt-cr01.mediatemple.net (64.93.75.14)  105.345 ms  93.555 ms  95.861 ms
[08:35:03] <gnarf> 14  * e1.1.as01.lax01.mtsvc.net (72.10.63.210)  104.574 ms  91.310 ms
[08:35:17] <gnarf> so yeah - its the last stop b4 mt's data center
[08:35:22] <mzgol> brb
[08:35:32] <gnarf> or they've blocked his IP
[08:36:04] <gnarf> which is most likely
[08:36:06] <gnarf> considering: https://gist.github.com/gnarf/586ea63ee514aeb58959
[08:36:17] <gnarf> if his ip were .142 or .140 traffic goes through ;)
[10:39:37] <m_gol> thx gnarf, I have access again :)
