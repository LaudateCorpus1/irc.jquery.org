[05:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> I need help with GitHub webhook parsing.
[05:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> I just pushed a branch to node-git-notifier that supports secrets.
[05:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-notifier/tree/secrets
[05:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> But for some reason the signature check only works for application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[05:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> When I switch to application/json, the check fails.
[05:57:39] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea why.
