[11:35:49] <gnarf_> scott_gonzalez: not sure how old those pings are
[11:40:12] <gnarf_> scott_gonzalez: um -- yeah -- database connection failing makes zero sense to me
[11:40:30] <gnarf_> i wonder if the auto-provisioning stuff broke on the new wp-content
[11:40:41] <gnarf_> did it work locally with latest wordpress?
[11:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it works fine with latest WordPress.
[11:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like the ansible vs. puppet config is the culprit.
[11:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is stage still running on puppet?
[11:44:12] <gnarf_> no
[11:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> Because the site is working on stage.
[11:44:14] <gnarf_> maybe?
[11:44:23] <gnarf_> i don't think so
[11:45:21] <gnarf> okay
[11:45:24] <gnarf> stage is on ansible
[11:45:32] <gnarf> live is still on puppet
[11:45:41] <gnarf> i never finished that port it seems
[11:46:30] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/ansible-master/hosts has a list of the hosts running on the ansible config
[11:47:07] <gnarf> Is this a finish ASAP task?
[11:47:19] <gnarf> I can't really drop the day job requirements until later this afternoon
[11:48:50] <gnarf> if the deadline on this is days out - i'll probably wait til days out, but if it needs to get done today, I'll make the time for it
[11:53:54] <gnarf> from my memory of like 3 months ago -- I think my conversion of these was blocked on not being able to get the download builders working properly in the stage environment --- needs testing again
