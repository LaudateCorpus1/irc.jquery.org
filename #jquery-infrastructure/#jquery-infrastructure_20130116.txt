[09:38:40] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: lols
[09:39:36] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: have you ever had puppet run out of memory?
[09:39:50] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nope
[09:39:51] <ryanneufeld> (non-jq related btw)
[09:40:42] <ryanneufeld> dang
[09:40:51] <ryanneufeld> I must have screwed up then
[09:57:48] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: do you have time to look at some debug output? I'm really stumped
[09:58:03] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: paste it, ill look asap
[09:58:10] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/dff2465ee0a4a9939140
[09:58:13] <ryanneufeld> thx
[09:58:47] <ryanneufeld> I think I might run bisect on my repo until I can find the change that caused it
[09:59:43] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: is there like a long running task somewhere in there maybe?
[09:59:48] <gnarf> downloading packages?
[09:59:49] <gnarf> etc?
[10:00:16] <ryanneufeld> it usually doesn't take this long though
[10:00:20] <ryanneufeld> that's what has me concerned

[11:01:32] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: figured it out, someone in #puppet had seen it before, turns out it was a recurse => true on a file{} resources to set permissions
[11:01:52] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: with lots of files in the subdirs? seems legit
[11:02:45] <ryanneufeld> yup
[11:02:49] <ryanneufeld> I turned it off
[11:02:55] <ryanneufeld> and BLAMO! it works
[11:02:56] <ryanneufeld> FML
[11:15:38] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: is there a way to modify a resource after it's been declared? Like change it with this syntax File['some/file/here.txt']?
[11:15:58] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: only from within the same class/define that originally defines it
[11:16:05] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: how?
[11:16:12] <ryanneufeld> I can't find it in the docs
[11:16:16] <gnarf> +> i think
[11:16:20] <gnarf> or something funky like that
[11:16:23] <gnarf> long time since i tried
[11:16:29] <gnarf> i remember it being a PITA
[11:17:50] <ryanneufeld> http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_resources.html#adding-or-modifying-attributes
[11:17:57] <ryanneufeld> not so much a PITA it seems
[11:23:09] <ryanneufeld> ah, all you can do is define things that weren't already defined
[11:23:18] <ryanneufeld> not change them

[16:59:04] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez ^^^
[17:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we can track how often plugins are released.
[17:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> And we can track what percentage of tags fail manifest validation.
[17:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm usually not good at coming up with interesting ways to process data :-/
[17:01:46] <gnarf> yeah me neither
[17:01:57] <gnarf> krinkle and clark have gotten some good reports tho
