[10:07:24] <jzaefferer> gnarf: we can shut down the old jenkins server now: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/
[10:39:01] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: ping! Hi.
[10:39:04] <s5fs> hi!
[10:39:16] <ryanneufeld> hey
[10:41:24] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld s5fs: I've got a job for you :-) 
[10:41:31] <jzaefferer> puppetizing all the jenkins jobs
[10:41:52] <ryanneufeld> it's just XML configs isn't it?
[10:41:58] <jzaefferer> so next time we have to move the jenkins server, there's no manual migration of jobs and all the other jenkins config
[10:42:34] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: I think so, yeah; not sure how plugin installation would work
[10:43:07] <jzaefferer> generally the problem is the workflow: Jenkins provides a (somewhat nice) UI for all that config. I certainly don't want to write XML to do the same.
[10:43:31] <jzaefferer> Though it would also be nice if it becomes easier to make changes to all jobs at once, e.g. all jobs that use TestSwarm should share some template for that

[10:45:12] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: There is an app for that
[10:45:26] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: At wikimedia we use jjb (jenkins-job-builder), a Python app from openstack.
[10:46:08] <Krinkle> Basically it uses a similar syntax (though YAML instead of XML), which is expanded into XML for jenkins.
[10:46:13] <Krinkle> allowing templates etc.
[10:47:00] <Krinkle> includes, parameters etc.
[10:47:12] <jzaefferer> this? http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/
[10:47:15] <Krinkle> Yep
[10:47:31] <gnarf> jzaefferer: will we need to save anything from /var/lib/jenkins on jq03 ?
[10:47:40] <Krinkle> Don't remove it yet
[10:47:57] <gnarf> wasn't planning on it, just curious
[10:48:07] <gnarf> i uninstalled and disabled the service
[10:48:32] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I don't think we need anything
[10:49:07] <Krinkle> An example of what it would look like: https://github.com/wikimedia/integration-jenkins-job-builder-config/blob/master/mediawiki.yaml
[10:49:11] <Krinkle> https://github.com/wikimedia/integration-jenkins-job-builder-config/blob/master/macro.yaml
[10:49:16] <Krinkle> you create macro's (which are build steps)
[10:49:26] <Krinkle> and then you create a job with one or more build steps in it
[10:49:50] <Krinkle> I'll look into setting it up for us. Should be fairly easy
[11:19:28] <jzaefferer> s5fs ryanneufeld: soo, want to work on this? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/187
[11:19:58] <jzaefferer> Otherwise it looks like there are plenty open infrastructure issues

[13:32:54] <Krinkle> gnarf: can you set up a wildcard url redirect from swarm.jquery.org:8080/** to jenkins.jquery.com/ ?
[13:33:12] <Krinkle> Not presering path or query since we're not presering build history
[14:35:52] <gnarf> Krinkle: um, yeah, i can do that i think - might wanna make it an issue though, higher priority things today
