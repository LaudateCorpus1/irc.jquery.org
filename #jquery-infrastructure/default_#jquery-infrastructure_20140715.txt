[05:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquerymobile.com 1.4.11 didn't deploy to production, only stage.
[05:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if there's a way to tell what happened.
[09:29:50] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: can you manually deploy to live?
[09:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but the question is why did nothing happen?
[09:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> There wasn't an email sent out at all. So it wasn't a typical failure, it seems like it just didn't run.
[09:30:48] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if we have any way to diagnose that at this point.
[09:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> I know the GitHub hook was sent because stage updated.
[09:31:42] <ryanneufeld> which site was it again? (on a diff compy)
[09:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquerymobile.com
[09:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> 1.4.11 tag
[09:35:45] <ryanneufeld> what machine is that living on?
[09:36:04] <ryanneufeld> http://www.cnet.com/news/cnet-attacked-by-russian-hacker-group/
[09:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty sure the deploys go to jq02 and that publishes to WordPress on jq01.
[09:41:46] <ryanneufeld> checking logs now
[09:43:16] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: not sure if this is related

[09:43:21] <ryanneufeld> Jul 15 04:53:45 nc02 puppet-agent[9758]: (/Stage[main]/Jquery::Postreceive/Jquery::Nodeinit[notifier-server]/Service[notifier-server]/ensure) ensure changed 'stopped' to 'running'
[09:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check the time of the tag.
[09:43:39] <ryanneufeld> but it seems like the notifier daemon had stopped
[09:43:44] <ryanneufeld> and puppet re-started it
[09:43:51] <ryanneufeld> which could have been the problem
[09:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> What timezone is that?
[09:44:21] <scott_gonzalez> The deploy would've been at 9:50a ET
[09:44:48] <ryanneufeld> that doesn't tell me what the time would be in UTC
[09:45:05] <ryanneufeld> or PDT
[09:45:13] <ryanneufeld> Tue Jul 15 09:44:55 PDT 2014
[09:45:22] <ryanneufeld> is what the server thinks it is
[09:45:30] <ryanneufeld> so, it's oddly on my timezone
[09:46:17] <ryanneufeld> so I'll look around 5~6am
[09:46:42] <ryanneufeld> this shows up a lot download.jqueryui.com[22173]: Caught exception: Error: listen EADDRINUSE     at errnoException (net.js:904:11)     at HTTPServer.Server._listen2 (net.js:1042:14)     at listen (net.js:1064:10)     at net.js:1146:9     at dns.js:72:18     at process._tickCallback (node.js:419:13)     at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:499:11)     at startup (node.js:119:16)     at node.

[09:49:32] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: can you check the github post commit hooks and verify which service it's hitting?
[09:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> http://jq02.jquery.com:3333
[09:51:09] <ryanneufeld> okay, so best guess I can give you is that the notifier service crashed
[09:51:16] <ryanneufeld> and puppet restarted it 30mins later
[09:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for digging :-)
[09:51:42] <ryanneufeld> that error keeps coming up
[09:52:05] <ryanneufeld> since it's all the same parent process, that's where I'd suggest starting
[09:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> The download builder error?
[09:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> There should probably be another error mixed in there.
[09:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> EADDRINUSE would mean that the service is already running and it started a second process.
[09:53:04] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/add271a278c78005ee3c 
[09:54:02] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...those are forced restarts, right?
[09:54:11] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/f26c10b3def7174332c2 
[09:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> They're scheduled to happen every 30 minutes?
[09:54:25] <ryanneufeld> yes, puppet ensures it's running
[09:54:31] <ryanneufeld> but doesn't restart it if it is running
[09:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:55:12] <ryanneufeld> so, unless puppet can't tell it's running
