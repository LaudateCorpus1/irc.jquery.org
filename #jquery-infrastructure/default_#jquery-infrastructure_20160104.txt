[11:21:27] <jzaefferer> s5fs: is puppet-stage good to merge to puppet-master? There's a bunch of Trac-related commits not on master. I want to get just this live: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/628c8e0554a09e5f98397935eac1b1c7640f6122
[11:22:15] <jzaefferer> s5fs: with the fixes you made elsewhere, that should work now just fine, right? to get http://api.jqueryui.com/1.12 working
[17:25:05] <s5fs> jzaefferer: I'll check the commit logs, been a bit since i was in there
[17:49:34] <s5fs> I'd assume whatever is on develop is pretty much ready to go though, at least that should be the case :D
[17:49:37] <s5fs> if it breaks, i fix
