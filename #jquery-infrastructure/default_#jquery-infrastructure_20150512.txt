[07:28:08] <m_gol> if anyone could help with https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/323, that'd be great; tests are not executed
[07:28:23] <m_gol> gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld Krinkle Krinkle|detached ^
[08:24:38] <s5fs> m_gol: I know nothing about debugging testswarm, but am happy to help any way that I can.
[08:25:02] <m_gol> the problem are very poor logs here :/
[08:25:05] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ know anything about that stuff?
[08:26:59] <s5fs> m_gol: you have ssh access to the host, correct?
[08:27:05] <m_gol> yup
[08:27:14] <s5fs> I can reboot the host if you want
[08:27:24] <s5fs> ;)
[08:27:33] <m_gol> s5fs: ok, who knows what helps ;)
[08:28:39] <s5fs> if you're serious, i'm happy to kick it over. would only take a minute.
[08:29:35] <m_gol> s5fs: do it then :)
[08:30:55] <s5fs> jeez it's been up over a year
[08:31:28] <s5fs> m_gol: okay I just ran 'apt-get update' and I see a jenkins update available. want me to apply it, then reboot?
[08:31:37] <m_gol> s5fs: sure
[08:36:17] <s5fs> patched and rebooting.. still waiting for ssh access
[08:37:49] <s5fs> crap i'm not sure it's coming back
[08:38:14] <s5fs> I've initiated another reboot, but this time from the web admin panel (not ssh)
[08:38:32] <s5fs> i also have limited visibility into the host once it hits a particular state, sooo lets hope for the best here :)
[08:38:47] <s5fs> 412 days uptime
[08:39:54] <s5fs> okay i see life
[08:41:47] <s5fs> still no ssh access though :/
[08:42:17] <s5fs> m_gol: okay we're back!
[08:42:29] <s5fs> that was a long reboot!
[08:43:54] <s5fs> try running the job again and let us know how it goes
[08:51:43] <Krinkle> m_gol: One guess would be user agent matching problems, though you say you can join from the Live interface?
[08:52:12] <Krinkle> Verify that your settings match the api.browserstack.com/vx/browsers list format
[08:52:20] <Krinkle> including after the ts-bs mapping is applied (see git repo for testsarm-browsertack)
[08:52:23] <Krinkle> bbl
[08:52:37] <m_gol> Krinkle: yup, I can join from Live
[08:53:09] <Krinkle> Maybe it's not alled "8." in the API of browsertack
[09:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: I haven't dug into tsbs at all.
[09:18:37] <m_gol> Krinkle: it's "8.3"
[09:18:50] <m_gol> there was nothing about it in the logs
[09:19:30] <m_gol> Krinkle: if settings in localSettings.json were incorrect I wouldn't be able to join the swarm as a recognized browser, wouldn't I?
[09:21:27] <m_gol> Krinkle: do I have to have an entry here? https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/blob/master/src/mapHelper.js. "iPhone 6", "iPhone 6 Plus", "iPad Mini 2" & "iPad Air" are specified devices
[09:21:33] <m_gol> for iOS 8.3
[09:25:29] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: thanks
[09:29:29] <m_gol> the iOS 8.3 UA is very similar to the 7.1 one so that's weird

[09:31:50] <m_gol> the only thing that changed in the pattern is the number format after "Safari/", it's now the same as what's after "AppleWebKit/"
