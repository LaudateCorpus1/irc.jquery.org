[03:59:16] <m_gol> gnarf: I might have a dynamic IP here at work... we're "temporarily" on quite a shitty network
[03:59:39] <m_gol> it seems I have a different IP than when I was cut off
[03:59:54] <m_gol> boy, IPv6 can't come soon enough
[11:36:43] <s5fs> gnarf: hi hi
[11:37:03] <s5fs> i'll test your stuffs in a bit
[11:49:46] <gnarf> s5fs: rock
[11:50:07] <s5fs> paper
[11:55:50] <gnarf> you've got me covered
[11:58:29] <s5fs> boom.
[12:00:35] <ryanneufeld> scissors!
[12:00:54] <s5fs> gnarf: yeah the axfr update is so much easier now, thanks! i just updated it again, despite it being just the timestamp
[12:06:16] <gnarf> s5fs: yay
[12:07:36] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: confirm. worksforme
[12:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> Who has experience with express and handlebars and wants to name a function?
[12:43:23] <ryanneufeld> I want to name a function
[12:43:31] <ryanneufeld> and i've used handlebars scott_gonzalez
[12:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Perfect: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/hbs/commit/e66c27c4a6ea30f4f893af243d6d844bb762a875#commitcomment-6326874
[12:45:57] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: getLocals()?
[12:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> He didn't seem to like the word locals at all.
[12:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think he's crazy.
[12:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> I've actually been trying to get this change in for 3 months.
[12:49:30] <ryanneufeld> Well, sounds like he has a case of "I don't wanna!"
[12:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm almost at the point where I'm just going to stop using this module and do this myself.
[12:55:30] <ryanneufeld> fork it
[12:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> Nah, if I was going to fork, I'd end up deleting a bunch of stuff.
[13:09:53] <gnarf> withVars({})
[13:10:29] <gnarf> oh nvm
[13:10:36] <gnarf> that does something different than i thought it did
[13:55:03] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: slimShady()?
[13:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: You should definitely just propose some random names :-)
[14:00:24] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: submit a PR with all the functions named after LotR characters
[14:00:48] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: only the ones that have died so far in the show
[14:04:04] <s5fs> show? you mean books? (lord of the rings)
[14:04:20] <s5fs> haha or name the functions after characters in the order they are introduced
