[00:46:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: strangely, this only happens on a first run
[00:46:38] <gnarf> second run, it seems okay
[00:52:06] <gnarf> new view is up
[00:52:20] <gnarf> lets see if this calms down the panic on jq03
[01:01:05] <gnarf> already seems a little better http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/history.php?action=showgraph&itemid=22713&period=345600
[01:03:50] <gnarf> that period is way to high
[01:03:53] <gnarf> look at like 12 hours
[01:04:16] <gnarf> used to spike crazy every 5 minutes or so, now it seems pretty stable

[05:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What's the easiest way for me to reproduce this?
[05:47:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lemme double check the last repro case
[05:48:03] <gnarf> but it will start with clone node-web-git-proxy
[05:48:04] <gnarf> :)
[05:49:19] <gnarf> and now it doesn't do it...
[05:49:23] <gnarf> sigh
[05:51:02] <Krinkle> gnarf: To fix data corruption
[05:51:02] <Krinkle> ssh jq03.jquery.com  
[05:51:06] <Krinkle> $ cd /var/www/swarm 
[05:51:10] <Krinkle> $ php scripts/fixRunresultCorruption.php  
[05:51:14] <gnarf> thx
[05:51:15] <Krinkle> Fixed 5 instances of corrupted data. 
[05:51:28] <gnarf> Krinkle: keep an eye on stuff today
[05:51:31] <gnarf> if you can
[05:51:44] <gnarf> the new view script is running now
[05:51:51] <gnarf> should be less intense in the load department
[05:52:01] <Krinkle> gnarf: Wait, so you meant the rewrite of the git-view script
[05:52:06] <Krinkle> not the rewrite in testswarm
[05:52:08] <Krinkle> (in the issue tracker)
[05:52:10] <gnarf> yes
[05:52:13] <Krinkle> Aha
[05:52:27] <gnarf> feel free to edit my comment for clarity
[05:52:28] <gnarf> :)
[05:52:35] <Krinkle> nah, it makes sense
[05:52:47] <gnarf> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/history.php?action=showgraph&itemid=22713&period=43200
[05:53:03] <Krinkle> *gasp*
[05:53:16] <Krinkle> That's from git-view?
[05:53:19] <gnarf> yeah
[05:53:32] <Krinkle> Which repo is that in
[05:53:45] <gnarf> web-view-jquery or something like that
[05:53:49] <Krinkle> k
[05:53:55] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org
[05:54:01] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org
[05:54:03] <Krinkle> yep
[05:54:12] <gnarf> now its https://github.com/jquery/node-web-git-proxy
[05:54:20] <Krinkle> oh, ok
[05:54:43] <Krinkle> ah, okay, so no list of commits in particular. you created a new repo from scratch and switched jq03 from one to another.
[05:55:03] <Krinkle> though you probably know, having written in, what the curlpit(s) were?
[05:55:03] <gnarf> yeah, on node now instead of python
[05:55:27] <gnarf> it wasn't doing any sort of check on "update" vs "still gonna be the same"
[05:55:43] <gnarf> so every branch & tag for every repo performed 2 git operations
[05:55:49] <gnarf> in 3 parallel crons
[05:56:02] <Krinkle> and then generated html pages from that unconditionally as well?
[05:56:03] <gnarf> every 5 minutes
[05:56:13] <gnarf> no, just a .json is only output
[05:56:20] <Krinkle> k
[05:56:32] <gnarf> but still, say 40 git pull's in 3 parallel
[05:57:02] <gnarf> i made mine compare to its last run to see if the SHA changed
[05:57:04] <gnarf> if not
[05:57:08] <gnarf> it just skips doing any updates
[05:58:28] <Krinkle> per branch, though, right?
[05:58:35] <Krinkle> the SHA1 check
[05:58:42] * Krinkle should look at the code
[05:59:34] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Yeah, it checks per branch (and tag)
[06:01:23] <Krinkle> k
[06:04:58] <gnarf> still left the three in parallel
[06:05:01] <gnarf> but whatever
[06:09:16] <gnarf> sigh, where is rxaviers when you need him
[06:09:19] <gnarf> :)
[08:13:30] <gnarf> Krinkle: btw, noticed today that the testswarm db is like 8gig
[08:13:42] <gnarf> seems excessive?
[08:14:17] <Krinkle> gnarf: hm..
[08:14:24] <Krinkle> gnarf: can you see which table is largest?
[08:14:27] <Krinkle> I suspect runresult
[08:14:32] <Krinkle> all those html doms
[08:14:46] <gnarf> yeah
[08:14:55] <gnarf> its pretty much all of it
[08:15:03] <gnarf> | testswarm          | runresults                                   |  8340357120 | 
[08:15:12] <gnarf> i notice this
[08:15:25] <gnarf> because i'm syncing 4gig of gzipped mysql backup per day to my laptop right now
[08:15:35] <Krinkle> :D
[08:15:53] <Krinkle> gnarf: my current testswarm work will not reduce this much, a little bit, but not much
[08:16:03] <Krinkle> gnarf: however the next phase is defintely going to reduce that
[08:16:24] <Krinkle> namely, by storing intepreting the data as data, instead of a string of html
[08:16:40] <Krinkle> e.g. building a JSON representation of the results, a unified object that is test framework agnostic
[08:16:56] <Krinkle> then we generate a html version of that on-demand, and store only the json version
[08:17:04] <Krinkle> that should be a lot denser than html
[08:17:16] <Krinkle> and makes the results machine readable
[08:17:26] <Krinkle> gnarf: thx, that's an extra motivation to prioritise that bug
[08:17:33] <Krinkle> it's goal wasn't to reduce db size, but this is a good point
[08:19:40] <Krinkle> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/183
[08:48:34] <Krinkle> gnarf: 504 gateway timeout
[08:48:46] <Krinkle> just got one again
[08:52:29] <Krinkle> and again
[08:52:35] <Krinkle> all clients timing out
[08:53:43] <Krinkle> So much for the Hope
[09:03:15] <gnarf> i'm still downloading 30 gig of backup from that machine
[09:03:26] <gnarf> but yeah
[09:03:32] <gnarf> something else still afoot
[09:03:37] <gnarf> we need to be ready to catch it
[09:03:40] <gnarf> look for symptoms
[09:03:49] <gnarf> wait with ssh open
[09:04:14] <gnarf> one thought
[09:04:27] <gnarf> basically - memory on these boxes is lame
[09:04:29] <gnarf> if we run out
[09:04:32] <gnarf> procs get killed
[09:15:53] <Krinkle> I have to run, will be back in a couple hours
