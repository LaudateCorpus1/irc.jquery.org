[04:07:47] <m_gol> s5fs jzaefferer Krinkle: iOS 8.0 simulator has broken User Agent so I asked BrowserStack to make 8.3 available which is OK. Not sure why they removed 8.0 when they were adding 8.3, perhaps they try to keep only version per each major bump available.
[04:09:37] <m_gol> s5fs jzaefferer Krinkle: the iOS 8.3 issue is a recent one but the more urgent issue now is that a lot of some tests are consistently failing after the host upgrade and it's 100% not related to Core changes (I restarted a previous successful build & it failed the same way). See: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/569; it should all be green. The errors are mostly AJAX/PHP-related so something must have been broken on our ser
[04:11:37] <m_gol> s5fs jzaefferer Krinkle: with iOS 8.3 before it's fixed I can always periodically go to BrowserStack via iOS 8.3 and join the swarm to get the tests run; tedious but it works. the failing tests are more urgent since we can't really land new serious changes now as who knows what might break when we cannot test it
[04:41:25] <m_gol> Krinkle: I deployed the new testswarm-browserstack and it picked up iOS 8.3 correctly. Thanks!
[04:41:42] <m_gol> s5fs jzaefferer: so we're left with this PHP/Ajax issue only now
[04:44:24] <jzaefferer> m_gol: the failures aren't specific to iOS, right?
[04:44:42] <m_gol> jzaefferer: no, they fail everywhere
[04:44:51] <m_gol> jzaefferer: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/569
[04:45:04] <jzaefferer> is this only about the ajax failures?
[04:45:15] <jzaefferer> or are manipulation and support tests related?
[04:50:56] <m_gol> jzaefferer: support tests dies on a CSP test
[04:53:45] <m_gol> jzaefferer: the test basically runs support/csp.php (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/data/support/csp.php)
[04:54:19] <m_gol> jzaefferer: manipulation fails on a global eval test that appends a script tag with src=data/testbar.php
[04:54:54] <m_gol> jzaefferer: ajax fails on retry tests that load data/errorWithText.php
[04:55:13] <m_gol> jzaefferer: so something fishy is going with PHP on the server...
[05:02:45] <jzaefferer> gotcha
[07:32:08] <jzaefferer> m_gol: from the swarm results its hard to tell what the tests are doing. For some reason the stacktraces only point at QUnit itself, not at the test code. If you could do the leg work of putting together the source references for each failing/breaking test along with the php files involved, I could take another look (or whoever else)
