[07:35:20] <m_gol> Krinkle: I knew about WebGL but I didn't know about APNG & Navigation Timing API
[07:36:03] <m_gol> Krinkle: I guess 7.1 differs from 8.0 mostly on a few system-level features, ones that don't just depend on WebKit
[07:36:23] <m_gol> but it may also mean we should test on all of them
[07:36:27] <m_gol> there's also 6.2
[07:36:37] <m_gol> but caniuse doesn't have it
[07:36:51] <m_gol> 6.2 should be equivalent to 7.1 but I'm sure they're different :D
[07:38:18] <m_gol> Krinkle: I don't have any resources currently but I've read about it in the past, the WebKit version in 6.1 & 7.0 was identical
[07:38:22] <m_gol> (it's visible in UA)
[07:40:55] <m_gol> Krinkle: we've just dropped Safari 6, I just wouldn't want to test jQuery on Safari 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 8.0, 8.1 & 9.0 in a month and 3 more in a year...
[08:10:26] <Krinkle> m_gol: Yeah, it's not unlike IE compat modes.
[08:11:06] <Krinkle> Except inversed. Rather than having a Safari 6 mode in Safari 7, they put a Safari 7 mode in Safari 6 etc.
