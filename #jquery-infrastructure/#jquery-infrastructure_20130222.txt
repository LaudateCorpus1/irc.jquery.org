[05:12:43] <wheresrhys> I've had this issue with the query plugins site http://forum.jquery.com/topic/duplicate-of-my-plugin-appearing-on-new-site-and-doesn-t-update-version. No response on the forum so thought I'd try here
[05:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> wheresrhys: The answer to all of your questions will be in http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log
[05:25:24] <wheresrhys> great - thanks. I'll fix defer later today. Should this also get rid of the phantom deferize plugin? If not, is it possible to put in a request to have it removed from the site?
