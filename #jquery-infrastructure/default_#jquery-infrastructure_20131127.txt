[06:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> GUYS!
[06:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of Trac sucking...
[06:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> Who wants to help write a new bug tracker from scratch?
[06:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> I promise it'll be horrible, painful, and wonderful, just like a startup.
[06:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> But without any pay.
[06:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> And probably no users for a long time.
[06:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds awesome, right?
[06:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> Who's in?
[06:51:42] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I'm totally in. The first thing we need is a bug tracker to track features.
[06:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Bootstrapping with GitHub issues :-)
[06:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/bug-tracker
[06:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as we've got something functional, I'd like to switch to using the bug tracker itself. That'll ensure that it's always working and we're solving real problems :-)
[07:34:33] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: that does kinda sound like fun
[07:54:08] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: what can I do to help with this bug-tracker? I can come up with names if that helps?
[07:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, on a call right now.
[07:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> I want to have a call with everyone interested to discuss how to build this.
[07:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> I came up with a name: DEBT.
[07:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> It's recursive... DEBT: Exceptional Bug Tracking
[07:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> And the slogan can be "pay down your debt."
[07:55:22] <ryanneufeld> nice
[07:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is there going to be an infra meeting today?
[07:58:15] <ryanneufeld> we have one scheduled, but we haven't been having them regularily
[07:58:26] <ryanneufeld> we have a hangout sched for next week, the 12th
[08:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld jzaefferer arschmitz: Do you guys want to have a call about DEBT right now?
[08:00:18] <ryanneufeld> I cannot
[08:00:20] <ryanneufeld> I am on a train
[08:01:00] <arschmitz> im fine anytime
[08:01:41] <ryanneufeld> I need a couple hours
[08:02:29] <ryanneufeld> can we do 2 hours from now?
[08:03:21] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: no thats the same time as dev leads meeting
[08:04:18] <ryanneufeld> well, shoot.
[08:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> We can do after dev leads, but jzaefferer won't be able to make it.
[08:05:35] <ryanneufeld> okay, scott_gonzalez you have me on skype correct?
[08:05:51] <ryanneufeld> ping me here and I'll join if i can
[08:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:06:13] <ryanneufeld> have you decided what language you want to build on?
[08:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's gonna be a node project, using express.
[08:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> But I've never used express before.
[08:07:02] <scott_gonzalez> So this will be interesting.
[08:07:13] <ryanneufeld> I have limited exp w/ node
[08:07:25] <ryanneufeld> so this could be very interesting
[08:08:14] <ryanneufeld> what DB?
[08:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> MySQL
[08:08:45] <ryanneufeld> cool
[08:11:36] <ryanneufeld> oooohhh, persona is built with express...
[09:17:34] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: seems overkill, lets just go back to tracking issues in google docs
[09:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> AHHHH!!!!!!
[09:18:10] <s5fs> excel?
[09:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:18:25] <s5fs> i bet sharepoint can do it haha
[09:19:05] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: is this a legit project you wish to move forward with?
[09:19:16] <s5fs> also, express is old and busted, restify is the new hotness
[09:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've thought about it for a few years.
[09:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> I finally want to actually attempt it.
[09:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> Haven't heard of restify, I'll check it out.
[09:21:47] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i'm starting to plan for a trac upgrade this week, i'll share my docs if anyone is truly interested
[09:22:31] <s5fs> you wanna write a bug tracker, gnarf wants to write a zabbix replacement, sounds like we're gunna have a busy winter
[09:22:35] <jzaefferer> I like the language, "starting to plan for"
[09:22:43] <ryanneufeld> I
[09:22:53] <ryanneufeld> have been starting to plan for a mt everest climb
[09:22:58] <s5fs> jzaefferer: its action-oriented yet non-committal
[09:23:17] <ryanneufeld> very buzzwordy s5fs
[09:23:49] <s5fs> thanks, i work hard to sell my free services
[09:24:50] <s5fs> but yeah, that's my plan for this week due to the holiday. i'm caught up on work for a bit and have a couple of extra days to unwind, so i figured i'd read docs and put together a rough plan.
[09:25:13] <s5fs> my other active personal project involves electronics, not quite as portable
[09:26:21] <ryanneufeld> I hear that
[10:16:39] <jzaefferer> s5fs: actually yes, I'm interested in docs on trac update. There are a few specific issues I'd like to see addressed
[10:17:11] <jzaefferer> Most prominently: Notification emails should stay in a single thread for a single ticket. Currently comments start a second thread.
[10:17:31] <jzaefferer> Also would be nice for commit hashes to actually link back to GitHub, not just be styled as links
[10:17:41] <jzaefferer> Should I file those in a ticket?
[10:20:02] <jzaefferer> s5fs: actually, there's plenty work there: https://github.com/jquery/bugs.jquery.com/issues
[10:21:19] <jzaefferer> s5fs: and https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/123
[10:23:03] <rxaviers> gnarf, ryanneufeld, hey guys
[10:23:12] <rxaviers> cc jzaefferer
[10:23:27] <rxaviers> I am having a travis error on globalize:
[10:23:28] <rxaviers> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/globalize/builds/14615923
[10:23:38] <ryanneufeld> hola
[10:23:40] <rxaviers> Do we have bower installed globally? If not, could we
[10:23:54] <rxaviers> Ol√° :)
[10:27:36] <rxaviers> (side note:  it's not urgent. It's not from master, but a branch I am working on...)
[10:43:34] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you can install prerequisites, like this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/.travis.yml
[10:43:49] <jzaefferer> make that `npm install -g bower` instead
[10:43:59] <rxaviers> aha!
[10:44:01] <jzaefferer> though you could try it with a local install first, that's supposed to work as well
[10:44:02] <rxaviers> nice ok thks
[10:44:19] <jzaefferer> odd that jQuery Core doesn't have any of that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.travis.yml
[11:28:08] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, it worked just fine after having bower install added http://git.io/rFQdKw thks
[13:14:59] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: do we have a channel for DEPT?
[13:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> I can create one.
[13:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> #debt seems to be clear of other poeple.
[13:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> Anything I need to do to "claim" the channel?
[13:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: ^
[13:18:25] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: ^^
[13:18:34] <ryanneufeld> you have to register it with chanserv
[13:18:43] <ryanneufeld> I just don't know how
[13:19:11] * ajpiano /chanserv help
[13:19:12] * scott_gonzalez uses the power of Google to try to learn
[13:19:16] * ajpiano /cs register
[13:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> Notice from ChanServ: #debt is now registered to Scott_Gonzalez.
[13:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:21:34] <ajpiano> lol
[13:58:16] <ryanneufeld> nice
[19:57:40] <s5fs> jzaefferer: cool, I'll review the issues and see how many can be addressed as part of this effort.
