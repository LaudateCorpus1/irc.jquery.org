[05:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: You can't use the token for the API :-(
[05:36:30] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Also, it looks like maybe you're on an old version of the code, it doesn't use tty.setRawMode() anymore.
[06:53:57] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: which version should I be using, I just cloned the repo
[06:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, I never pushed the changes.
[06:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to get this working again.
[06:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> My local checkout has some changes for node 0.8, but it also has my user/pass hardcoded :-P
[06:55:07] <ryanneufeld> oic
[06:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> I really hate that you can't use the token.
[06:55:37] <ryanneufeld> ahh, I see
[06:56:03] <ryanneufeld> interesting that it worked for gnarf, but not me
[10:00:22] <gnarf> i rarely use gist-diff
[10:00:29] <gnarf> but i seem to remember it breaking at some point too
[10:01:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you might be able to request an oauth token and store it
[10:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> yes, but then I need to go through a registration process
[10:15:59] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: turns out the way to invalidate that token of mine was to change my password
[10:16:17] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nice

[10:25:40] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-master] Updating rules for semver tags /cc @scottgonzalez - Corey Frang
[10:25:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[10:26:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:35:14] <gnarf> danheberden: hey, I've got a meeting this afternoon with the guys about that new service
[10:35:27] <danheberden> oh awesome gnarf
[10:35:38] <gnarf> danheberden: dunno if you're interested in sitting in, but I could forward you the meeting invitation
[10:35:38] <danheberden> on service to rule them all
[10:36:06] <danheberden> gnarf, i am, but i have like 4 projects going on at once and don't want to get to that "omg i'll just not do anything" stage
[10:36:34] <danheberden> so i'll rely on your expertise in what we can do as a project with them
[11:05:22] <ryanneufeld> danheberden or gnarf either of you know anything about dnsmasq?
[11:05:37] <danheberden> yeah, i use it
[11:05:42] <gnarf> no, but I know about running real DNS servers :)
[11:05:50] <danheberden> just for it's autoomatic use of hosts files
[11:05:55] <danheberden> *autooOooOOoOmatic
[11:05:58] <gnarf> djb is a dick btw, but djbdns is awesome
[11:06:06] <danheberden> haha
[11:06:24] <danheberden> i swear there's an inappropriate initialism there
[11:06:34] <ryanneufeld> http://serverfault.com/questions/434894/configure-dnsmasq-to-allow-wildcards-for-dns-entries-from-dhcp
[11:06:45] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to figure out how to make that work
[11:06:50] <danheberden> haha -1
[11:07:08] <ryanneufeld> we wanna us vagrant for vms, but knowing the MAC is kinda not easy
[11:07:55] <danheberden> i don't know near enough about dns to help :/
[11:08:22] <danheberden> does address with just the fqdn fail then?
[11:13:18] <ryanneufeld> from my example the stage01.example.com works fine
[11:21:55] <danheberden> does dnsmasq let you make actual dns records against a domain you've made? like add the a record `*.stage01` for domain example.com?
[11:22:09] <danheberden> might be worth just running a regular ol' dns server like gnarf recommended
[11:22:34] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: imagine a system where you could dynamically stand up an instance of a VM with any tag you liked
[11:22:40] <ryanneufeld> and that the tag would be the subdomain
[11:23:23] <ryanneufeld> but each tag also needs to be wildcarded as our system relies on some subdomains for things
[11:27:43] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: your local VMs are given a static host-only IP right?
[11:27:53] <gnarf> just define them in your hosts file
[11:28:01] <ryanneufeld> not the point
[11:28:09] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to avoid hosts files
[11:28:11] <gnarf> you wanna test it from your phone?
[11:28:22] <ryanneufeld> right now, I can stand up a machine ryan.metrolyrics.com
[11:28:24] <ryanneufeld> and it works
[11:28:29] <ryanneufeld> everyone in the office can see it
[11:28:32] <ryanneufeld> and it works as expected
[11:28:42] <ryanneufeld> what doesn't work is m.ryan.metrolyrics.com
[11:28:56] <ryanneufeld> and yes, I'd like to be able to test *that* from my phone
[11:28:57] <gnarf> CNAME ?
[11:29:14] <ryanneufeld> remember that puppet stuff you helped me with?
[11:29:18] <ryanneufeld> this is what that's for
[11:29:23] <ryanneufeld> If I set the hostname to bunnies
[11:29:30] <gnarf> *.ryan.metrolyrics.com. CNAME ryan.metrolyrics.com.
[11:29:37] <ryanneufeld> then bunnies.metrolyrics.com will resolv to that machine
[11:29:37] <gnarf> static dns entry
[11:30:08] <ryanneufeld> but I'd need *.bunnies to work as well
[11:30:31] <ryanneufeld> this is so that anyone of the devs, without having access to our DNS settings can standup a machine that works
[11:30:37] <ryanneufeld> I could stand up two machines
[11:30:45] <ryanneufeld> but that seems like overkill
[11:31:43] <ryanneufeld> okay, http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2010q4/004610.html
[11:31:55] <ryanneufeld> that's a couple years old
[11:32:05] <ryanneufeld> but if it hasn't been added...
[11:33:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: if you were using a real dns server, you could just add a CNAME record
[11:33:33] <gnarf> :)
[11:33:45] <ryanneufeld> dynamically?
[11:33:54] <ryanneufeld> I *can* add those manually
[11:33:58] <ryanneufeld> that's not the point
[11:34:05] <ryanneufeld> I don't want to have to
[11:34:17] <ryanneufeld> looks like dnsmasq doesn't work that way though
[11:34:58] <gnarf> so, what I'm saying is that if you were running a real dns server, you'd be modifying your hosts files on new dhcp leases or whatever
[11:35:01] <gnarf> and at that point
[11:35:09] <gnarf> you could write a cname record
[11:35:12] <gnarf> so yes, dynamically
[11:35:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah, you can do it with bind and DHCP actually
[11:35:26] <ryanneufeld> which is what I'm going to do at home
[11:35:31] <ryanneufeld> but at work we're using pfsense
[11:35:38] <gnarf> wtf is that
[11:35:40] <ryanneufeld> as our dns/dhcp
[11:35:49] <ryanneufeld> http://pfsense.org/
[11:35:57] <ryanneufeld> bsd based router image
[11:36:08] <ryanneufeld> honestly though, I'm not that happy with it
[11:36:18] <ryanneufeld> but it's one of those "not my call" things
[11:36:39] <ryanneufeld> though I could move DHCP and DNS off that, and onto another machine
[11:37:18] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: suggestion - have another machine running bind/djbdns and write a really simple way to have a machine spinning up report its ip
[11:37:38] <gnarf> then offload it on another domain that you can just set the NS records for on your main dns server
[11:37:49] <gnarf> like metro.local
[11:37:56] <gnarf> or something
[11:50:00] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I just suggested that to my boss
[11:50:06] <ryanneufeld> we might go that route
[11:50:19] <ryanneufeld> I may even create a subnet just for our dev machines
[11:50:21] <ryanneufeld> and vms
[11:50:25] <gnarf> +1
[11:59:20] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues?milestone=5&state=open you okay with those tasks?
[12:00:41] <ryanneufeld> in what regard
[12:00:41] <ryanneufeld> ?
[12:01:14] <gnarf> pre-summit tasks
[12:01:31] <ryanneufeld> so are the ones that are assigned to me okay for me to do?
[12:01:32] <ryanneufeld> I think so
[12:01:44] <ryanneufeld> I've already started on 88
[12:01:49] <ryanneufeld> but I was on the wrong branch locally
[12:02:02] <ryanneufeld> so I have to figure out how to put them in the correct branch
[12:02:43] <gnarf> cherry-pick em
[12:03:03] <gnarf> no need for -x in that case tho because its coming in from an external branch
[12:03:09] <gnarf> but -x between stage/master
[12:03:17] <ryanneufeld> i was on master
[12:03:22] <ryanneufeld> I need them in stage
[12:03:30] <ryanneufeld> bah
[12:03:40] <ryanneufeld> I'll sort it out tonight
[12:14:18] <ryanneufeld> yes! bind and dhcp will be on their own machine

[12:21:02] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-stage] Revert "add splunk module" - Corey Frang
[12:21:07] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: cherry-pick the commit SHA from master
[12:21:10] <gnarf> then reset your master
[12:21:11] <gnarf> :)
[12:21:15] <gnarf> no need to -x it
[12:21:48] <ryanneufeld> if it's more than one commit, i'd just cherry pick both?
[12:21:56] <gnarf> yeah, by SHA in order
[12:22:09] <ryanneufeld> ok
[12:29:07] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: /me is curious about something now
[12:29:17] <ryanneufeld> is you now?
[12:29:19] <gnarf> puppet master --compile / puppet agent --catalog
[12:29:35] <gnarf> it seems to me that puppet master is parsing things in different order than puppet agent
[12:30:10] <ryanneufeld> yes, it does do that
[12:31:30] <ryanneufeld> though the end result should be the same
[12:31:44] <ryanneufeld> the way that puppet catalogs things can change how they're applied
[12:32:43] <gnarf> right, but this seems to be effecting our use of requireing classes
[12:32:54] <gnarf> like it works in the master/agent setup
[12:34:06] <ryanneufeld> you tested what we tried?
[12:41:04] <gnarf> i still don't know whats up with the mysql bs
[12:41:11] <gnarf> it works from the catalog
[12:41:16] <gnarf> jq01 doesn't complain

[13:12:35] <gnarf> its puppet 3
[13:13:15] <gnarf> so we gotta fix it

[15:18:26] <ryanneuf_> olry
[15:20:38] <ryanneufeld_> got it sorted gnarf?
[15:26:48] <gnarf> i think
[15:26:54] <gnarf> trying to file a pull to the upstream for it
[15:41:31] <gnarf> also trying to merge upstream with ours
[15:56:06] <ryanneufeld> gah, our internet is up and down more often than a hookers pants on pay-day
[15:59:01] <ryanneuf_> gnarf: I can get jq01.stage to stand up now
[15:59:09] <ryanneuf_> but it's still complaining about nginx
[15:59:51] <gnarf> yup
[16:00:00] <ryanneuf_> is that okay? or not
[16:00:04] <gnarf> nope
[16:00:12] <gnarf> one bug at a time
[16:00:19] <gnarf> :)
[16:00:28] <ryanneuf_> "Starting nginx: [emerg]: unknown directive "fastcgi_cache_bypass" in /etc/nginx/microcache_fastcgi_params:41"
[16:00:36] <ryanneuf_> ha, yeah
[16:00:39] <ryanneuf_> I hear yah
[16:00:52] <ryanneuf_> sounds like you had to get all mid-evil on puppet to get what you wanted
[16:02:14] <gnarf> im trying to update the mysql-module with some upstream changes
[16:02:26] <ryanneuf_> ah
[16:02:37] <ryanneuf_> how do give myself +v?
[16:02:46] <gnarf> where?
[16:02:48] <ryanneuf_> here
[16:03:03] <gnarf>  /cs voice #jquery-infrastructure ?

[16:34:45] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-master] Merged our mysql module with the upstream - Corey Frang
[16:36:31] <gnarf> so ryanneuf_
[16:36:47] <gnarf> your half standing jq01, is that with the dotdeb changes?
[16:37:35] <ryanneuf_> yes
[16:39:02] <gnarf> so we need to figure this one out
[16:39:30] <ryanneufeld> oh, you mean the stuff we played with last night?
[16:39:54] <gnarf> the dirty mods in the checkout we don't own
[16:40:00] <gnarf> i could pull request it i guess
[16:40:06] <ryanneufeld> whatever i"m using is puppet-stage from before those last two commits
[16:40:46] <gnarf> is modules/dotdeb dirty tho?
[16:43:12] <ryanneuf_> no
[16:43:14] <ryanneuf_> not here
[16:43:23] <ryanneuf_> different comp
[16:44:23] <ryanneuf_> gotta go afk for a bit
[16:45:19] <gnarf> man there are ryanneuf_'s everywere
[16:45:31] <ryanneuf_> hah
[16:45:45] <gnarf> which one is he?!@#
[16:46:27] <ryanneuf_> I was switching between clients
[16:46:36] <ryanneuf_> I think I need to get that thing working
[16:58:19] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: so it seems to be a two pass thing atm - needs an up then a provision to get it working :)
[17:01:36] <ryanneuf_> right
[17:01:41] <ryanneuf_> so a dependency is out of whack
[17:02:16] <ryanneuf_> afk for a while
[17:02:24] <ryanneuf_> gnarf: use my full usrname ryanneufeld
[17:02:32] <ryanneuf_> I've got another client logged in with that one
[17:02:49] <Krinkle> gnarf: do we have our own mysql puppet repo? You mentioned merge, which implies there is a merge commit (I assume that commit is not just in your local working copy)
[17:06:03] <gnarf> Krinkle: it uses my fork of an upstream
[17:06:10] <Krinkle> cool
[17:06:35] <Krinkle> gnarf: is the fork due to package {} resources? Or something else
[17:06:53] <gnarf> Krinkle: there are some issues solved in some unmerged pulls
[17:06:59] <Krinkle> ok
[17:07:02] <gnarf> im just not happy with the upstream, so we use my fork
[17:07:03] <gnarf> :)
[17:08:20] <gnarf> i actually kinda want to suggest we do that for most submodules
[17:08:45] <gnarf> because changing the upstream of a submodule is a pain in the ass for anyone who already has a clone
[17:39:12] <Krinkle> gnarf: how so?
[17:40:17] <gnarf> git submodule update wont fix remotes if you change the location of the module's upstream
[17:40:36] <gnarf> also, it caches all of that stuff somewhere in a .git folder as well
[17:40:47] <gnarf> so you have to like nuke/modify lines of code
[17:40:58] <gnarf> in the configs
[17:41:11] <gnarf> to get it to properly pull from the right remote
[17:43:34] <Krinkle> oh, changing the upstream, as in switching remotes
[17:43:58] <Krinkle> yeah, I thought you meant changing like, changing the hash pointer for the submodule
[17:44:34] <Krinkle> (in other words, just  updating it)
[17:44:52] <Krinkle> oh I see now
[17:45:05] <Krinkle> yeah, but wouldn't you have your own clone in a different tree?
[17:45:38] <Krinkle> meh, even more annoying
[17:47:27] <gnarf> :)
[17:47:43] <gnarf> good summary of why submodules suck

[20:07:30] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: also, see #jquery-developer-summit ?
[20:50:42] <ryanneuf_> gnarf: what version of virtualbox do we want to standardize on?
[20:51:10] <ryanneuf_> 4.2 is the latest
[20:55:33] <clarkbox> on OSX, the latest is 4.1 :(
[20:56:41] <ryanneuf_> clarkbox: you're mistaken
[20:56:50] <ryanneuf_> clarkbox: VirtualBox 4.2.1 for OS X hosts  x86/amd64
[20:57:02] <ryanneuf_> https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
[20:57:15] <ryanneuf_> 4.2.1 fixed the bugs caused by 10.8.2
[20:58:22] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: latest
[20:58:36] <ryanneuf_> k
[20:58:38] <ryanneuf_> 4.2 it is
[20:59:06] <clarkbox> i am on 10.7.4, and i can only get 4.1.23
[21:00:08] <gnarf> clarkbox: 10.7.5 with 4.2.0 here
[21:00:28] <ryanneuf_> clarkbox: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.0/VirtualBox-4.2.1-80871-OSX.dmg
[21:00:33] <clarkbox> ok, never mind. i am basing this off of the update check in virtual box
[21:00:42] <ryanneuf_> ha
[21:00:42] <ryanneuf_> yeah
[21:00:44] <clarkbox> its telling me i have the latest
[21:00:49] <ryanneuf_> yeah
[21:00:59] <ryanneuf_> it doesn't check the minor releases
[21:01:01] <clarkbox> so its the one lying - not me! ;)
[21:01:02] <ryanneuf_> gehy
[21:01:51] * ryanneuf_ notes to have direct download links for his readme
[21:06:33] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: so my vagrant jq01.stage stands up
[21:06:39] <gnarf> is yours still buggy?
[21:06:48] <ryanneuf_> dunno
[21:06:54] <ryanneuf_> working on the new box right now
[21:07:08] <gnarf> k
[21:07:10] <gnarf> do that
[21:07:20] <ryanneuf_> I'm gonna :)
[21:07:27] <gnarf> its more important anyway
[21:07:36] <gnarf> itll save us like 60 seconds per provision
[21:08:12] <ryanneuf_> that adds up when you're dicking with shit all the time
[21:10:00] <gnarf> thats sexual
[21:10:08] <ryanneuf_> yes it is
[21:10:12] <ryanneuf_> unintentionally
[21:13:02] <clarkbox> k here is my feeble attempt at puppatizing splunk… hows this look: https://gist.github.com/3133b775f3f2a0d5ff76
[21:13:02] <ryanneuf_> I have newest vbox additions and puppet installed
[21:13:35] <clarkbox> i guess i can relocate the common stuff to init.pp
[21:16:11] <clarkbox> gnarf ^
[21:16:29] <clarkbox> not sure about the service{} and the exec with the splunk start
[21:16:47] <clarkbox> need to pass in --accept on first run to avoid nag
[21:17:01] <gnarf> so, those two execs will always run
[21:17:07] <gnarf> every time puppet runs
[21:17:12] <gnarf> do they create a file?
[21:17:44] <clarkbox> oh ok. they only need to run on first install
[21:18:03] <gnarf> okay
[21:18:08] <ryanneuf_> clarkbox: is there a config file that get's modified as a result of that command?
[21:18:25] <gnarf> can you commit that to a "splunk" branch and push it up?
[21:18:27] <clarkbox> the --accept-license - not really
[21:18:40] <gnarf> I can wire up some notifications
[21:18:46] <clarkbox> the deployment server one can be done by setting a conf file
[21:19:22] <gnarf> clarkbox: so can you write an unless => "grep 'deploy-poll citadel.jquery.com:8089' conffile" or something ?
[21:19:26] <gnarf> for that one?
[21:20:47] <clarkbox> sure
[21:20:48] <jqcommit> [infrastructure] clarkbox created puppet-splunk (+1 new commit): https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/9e780746bf49
[21:20:48] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-splunk] first shot at adding splunk module - clark a
[21:21:02] <ryanneuf_> gnarf: "[default] Exporting VM..."
[21:23:30] <clarkbox> i add these ~20mb deb files to the repo?
[21:25:48] <gnarf> clarkbox: hrm
[21:25:49] <ryanneuf_> clarkbox: is there not a repo they can be installed from?
[21:26:00] <clarkbox> no there is not
[21:26:04] <ryanneuf_> or can you fetch them with curl/wget
[21:26:22] <gnarf> ^^^ ?
[21:26:24] <clarkbox> well i am using a beta
[21:26:35] <clarkbox> so they are not publicly available
[21:26:45] <clarkbox> i can put them on dropbox
[21:26:53] <ryanneuf_> does the public version not work?
[21:27:00] <clarkbox> it does just fine
[21:27:03] <gnarf> dropbox is a decent solution
[21:27:06] <clarkbox> but beta has more features and is stable
[21:27:20] <gnarf> just curl it from a dropbox link
[21:27:23] <clarkbox> its v 5.0. its at RC2. should ship end of month
[21:27:24] <ryanneuf_> do we need the features? (just asking)
[21:27:25] <clarkbox> 10-4
[21:27:29] <ryanneuf_> ah
[21:27:37] <ryanneuf_> could revisit then
[21:27:38] <clarkbox> ya, mostly for the deployment management stuff
[21:27:44] <ryanneuf_> ah
[21:27:57] <clarkbox> and its much faster than current 4.x release
[21:28:27] <ryanneuf_> cool
[21:28:40] <ryanneuf_> don't get me wrong, I'm asking for information, not to question judgment
[21:28:51] <clarkbox> ya its all good
[21:28:54] <clarkbox> valid questions
[21:29:34] <ryanneuf_> yeah, I always ask questions like that
[21:29:36] <gnarf> clarkbox: dropbox link sounded bestest so far :)
[21:29:52] <ryanneuf_> mostly it's cause I'm new and am trying to grok the situation
[21:30:01] <clarkbox> sounds good. ill go that route. ill also petition splunk to put up a repo
[21:30:09] <gnarf> apt repos are nice
[21:30:15] <ryanneuf_> I love my internets
[21:30:15] <gnarf> hard to setup tho
[21:30:22] <ryanneuf_> uplaoding at 500k
[21:30:41] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: where you puttin it?
[21:30:59] <ryanneuf_> dropbox at the moment
[21:31:00] <gnarf> k
[21:31:24] <gnarf> i was thinking about trying out the github "downloads" section - but its prolly bigger than we'd wanna drop there
[21:31:29] <clarkbox> so on the vagrant box, i think its running amd64
[21:31:57] <gnarf> amd64 on the live stuff too i think
[21:32:05] <clarkbox> and on the MT box i am on right now, its running x86_64
[21:32:27] <gnarf> hrm
[21:32:28] <clarkbox> clarkbox@citadel:~$ uname -a
[21:32:29] <clarkbox> Linux citadel.jquery.com 2.6.32-028stab101.1 #1 SMP Sun Jun 24 19:50:48 MSD 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[21:32:38] <clarkbox> splunk has a different release for each arch
[21:32:42] <clarkbox> so...
[21:32:42] <gnarf> so
[21:32:59] <ryanneuf_> our vagrant images are 64bit
[21:33:07] <gnarf> you can do an $::arch ? { amd64 => url1, x86_64 => url2 }
[21:33:12] <gnarf> i think its arch anyway
[21:33:14] <gnarf> check facter
[21:33:15] <clarkbox> cool
[21:33:28] <gnarf> architecture => amd64
[21:33:33] <gnarf> its ::architecture
[21:33:38] <ryanneuf_> x86_64 !== am64 ?
[21:33:43] <ryanneuf_> x86_64 !== amd64 ?*
[21:33:44] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: sadly yes and no
[21:33:52] <gnarf> newer intel chips are amd64
[21:34:04] <gnarf> a few older ones were x86_64
[21:35:04] <ryanneuf_> same instruction set
[21:35:05] <gnarf> clarkbox: i'll let you do a bit more with that branch before I poke at it
[21:35:12] <clarkbox> yup sounds good
[21:35:15] <ryanneuf_> afaik they are interchangable
[21:35:35] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: apparently not to build targets in gnu
[21:35:36] <gnarf> :)
[21:35:44] <ryanneuf_> ffs
[21:35:49] <ryanneuf_> that's annoy
[21:44:53] <ryanneuf_> gnarf:
[21:45:06] <ryanneuf_> do you know how to get the download link for dropbox?
[21:46:14] <gnarf> yeah
[21:46:19] <gnarf> the "Link" button
[21:46:26] <gnarf> you can right click i think too
[21:46:34] <gnarf> in the OS native
[21:46:52] <gnarf> yeah

[21:49:00] * gnarf waits for the Vagrantfile to test
[21:49:01] <gnarf> :)
[21:49:42] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: also, another reason to use a branch on jquery/ is then I don't need to add your remote to my local ;)
[21:51:27] <ryanneuf_> I need to get a dl.dropbox.com link
[21:52:46] <gnarf> https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qxr8hhdqzhy5167/jqSqueeze.box
[21:52:47] <gnarf> ?
[21:53:26] <gnarf> https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qxr8hhdqzhy5167/jqSqueeze.box?dl=1
[21:55:47] <ryanneuf_> neat
[21:55:52] <ryanneuf_> waiting to see if jq01 stands up
[21:56:42] <clarkbox> hey so what/how do i move some of this into init.pp
[21:57:06] <clarkbox> just… move it and it will run when forwarder/indexer.pp does?
[21:58:17] <jqcommit> [infrastructure] ryanneufeld created issue88 (+1 new commit): https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/4e98bec55391
[21:58:17] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/issue88] Moved Vagrant file into root. Also moved bin files into root - Ryan Neufeld
[21:58:26] <ryanneuf_> gnarf: happy now?
[22:01:01] <gnarf> clarkbox: you can "inherit" a class from another class
[22:01:16] <gnarf> so have both the ::forwarder and ::indexer inherit the root one
[22:01:24] <clarkbox> ok
[22:02:04] <ryanneuf_> doh
[22:02:08] <ryanneuf_> I need to make a new box
[22:02:12] <ryanneuf_> that has pwgen on it
[22:02:18] <gnarf> heh
[22:02:28] <gnarf> ok, ill test this one tho
[22:02:46] <gnarf> how to i kill the cached .box files btw?
[22:03:47] <ryanneuf_> rm -r ~/.vagrant.d/boxes/jqSqueeze64
[22:11:16] <ryanneuf_> gnarf: I'm stunned
[22:14:41] <gnarf> ryanneuf_: ?
[22:14:52] <ryanneuf_> jq01.stage came up no errors
[22:14:57] <gnarf> nice
[22:15:07] <ryanneuf_> I'm re-packaging the box
[22:15:10] <gnarf> prolly still needs a second run of puppet to get mysql perms right
[22:16:54] <ryanneuf_> I just did a destroy and up again
[22:16:56] <ryanneuf_> to be sure
[22:20:19] <ryanneuf_> gnarf: not a single error
[22:22:03] <gnarf> one down
[22:22:04] <gnarf> :)
