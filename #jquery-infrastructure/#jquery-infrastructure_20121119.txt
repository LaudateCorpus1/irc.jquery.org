[08:26:13] <gnarf> clarkbox: there are two more channels we need to add to jqlog
[08:26:25] <gnarf> clarkbox: you think you could write up a wiki page about adding a channel to the irc logs?
[08:27:06] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/121 and https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/126
[09:21:26] <gnarf> clarkbox: you here?
[09:22:07] <gnarf> clarkbox: citadel's drive is full - can we remove some splunk data to get some space back?
[09:26:07] <gnarf> clarkbox: consider this a "RED" priority thing - its not collecting data for zabbix atm - there are holes in the graphs
[12:01:01] <clarkbox> gnarf, will add those channels and write up wiki entry
[12:01:21] <gnarf> clarkbox: thanks - hold on on #jquerymobile tho
[12:01:23] <gnarf> we might kill it
[12:01:33] <gnarf> re a chat that just happened in dev leads
[12:01:55] <clarkbox> k
[12:03:44] <gnarf> we are killing it
[12:03:45] <gnarf> confirm
[12:06:21] <clarkbox> k
[12:06:44] <gnarf> ajpiano: can you handle the #jquerymobile side of this ? also - any chance you could give me chanserv op/founder in the -dev channels? 
[12:08:18] <ajpiano> yes on th elatter
[12:10:03] <ajpiano> sorry am otp
[12:11:17] <gnarf> ajpiano: no rush - just spreading the word
[12:11:23] <gnarf> changed topic in #jquery
[12:11:27] <gnarf> also fixed ?channels on bot-t
[12:37:59] <gnarf> ajpiano: the request for founder was so I can be another person people can bug to add ops instead of you ;)
[12:38:14] <gnarf> if you like, i'll still bug you to add ops instead ;)
[12:50:50] <ajpiano> gnarf: done
[12:51:02] <gnarf> ty
[12:51:08] <ajpiano> for ui-dev, mobile-dev, -content, -infra, and -dev
[12:51:27] <gnarf> its like the master key!
[12:52:20] <gnarf> ajpiano: whenever you do the #jquerymobile thing, set a new /topic and +m is probably a good idea too
