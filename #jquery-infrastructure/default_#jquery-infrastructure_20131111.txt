[15:37:06] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: why was that?
[15:41:11] <gnarf> we actually decided to kill this machine ages ago
[15:41:21] <gnarf> and it kept spamming us with seemingly rootkitted crontabs :)
[15:41:31] <ryanneufeld> ahy
[15:41:35] <ryanneufeld> makes sense :p
[16:19:23] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i can move the rootkit to a different system if you want
[16:19:27] <s5fs> i didn't back up any other data
[16:25:43] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: I'm not worried about it
[16:25:58] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: :D
[16:34:42] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: I'm considering decorating my xmass tree w/ these http://www.adafruit.com/products/738
[21:11:35] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: do it, that would be sweet
