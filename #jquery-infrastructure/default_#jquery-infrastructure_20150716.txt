[06:24:55] <m_gol> ryanneufeld gnarf s5fs: TestSwarm is down, all I get is CloudFlare cache
[08:35:41] <m_gol> markelog: we do use Weekly builds for both master & compat. Both jQuery Core Periodic & jQuery Core Compat Periodic are run
[09:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld gnarf s5fs: Just in case you missed it earlier from m_gol: TestSwarm is down.
[09:18:10] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I'd love to help, but i'm in training at work right now
[09:18:15] <ryanneufeld> and I have no idea how that stuff works
[09:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:18:20] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle_: Can you fix?
[09:53:19] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: checking
[09:53:27] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: Thanks bro!
[09:53:33] <Krinkle> I'm in Mehico btw
[09:53:38] <Krinkle> Wikimania conference
[09:53:50] <ryanneufeld> nice
[09:53:55] <Krinkle> Do we have an origin domain for swarm?
[09:54:21] <Krinkle> Or can I use the swarm-01* domain?
[09:54:27] <Krinkle> I guess we do hostname checking
[09:54:51] <Krinkle> ssh doesn't seem to be responding
[09:54:59] <Krinkle> Not sure what I can do here
[09:55:14] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: Do you have ops powers to reboot it?
[09:55:21] <ryanneufeld> I do
[09:55:26] <Krinkle> :)
[09:55:28] <ryanneufeld> but I'm not available to ensure it comes back up
[09:55:36] <Krinkle> Right..
[09:55:41] <Krinkle> how recent are backups?
[09:55:42] <ryanneufeld> can you do a sudo reboot?
[09:55:47] <Krinkle> I can't ssh into it
[09:55:47] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure
[09:55:50] <Krinkle> just times out
[09:55:52] <ryanneufeld> shit
[09:56:00] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: It's all you buddy
[09:56:02] <Krinkle> Hm.. maybe try from another instance
[09:56:33] <Krinkle> ping timeout as well
[09:56:49] <Krinkle> ping to swarm-01 from jenkins/jq07 times out as well
[09:56:52] <Krinkle> So.. fucked
[09:57:14] <Krinkle> do we have graphs for resource usage of that instance?
[09:57:24] * ryanneufeld shrugs
[09:57:24] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[09:57:34] * ryanneufeld is unavailable for a few hours
[09:57:37] <Krinkle> OK :)
[09:57:48] <Krinkle> I'm gonan try to keep at its state before we reboot 
[09:57:52] <Krinkle> peek*
[10:05:01] <Krinkle> Ah, it's called zabbic
[10:05:04] <Krinkle> zabbix
[10:05:10] <Krinkle> I remember something like cinderalla
[10:05:14] <Krinkle> oh citadel.jquery.com
[10:24:16] <Krinkle> Hm.. gnarf: s5fs: scott_gonzalez: Could one of you create me a login for citadel/zabbix?
[10:25:14] <gnarf> not sure whats happening there, but i'll look into it
[10:25:16] <gnarf> zabbix is broken
[10:25:18] <gnarf> hard
[10:25:34] <gnarf> all the info on it is "public" tho
[10:25:39] <gnarf> you shouldn't need a login to view graphs
[10:25:43] <Krinkle> Is there a guest account
[10:25:43] <Krinkle> ?
[10:25:56] <Krinkle> http://citadel.jquery.com/ is 404 http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix is auth
[10:28:17] <Krinkle> brb in 1h/
[10:29:32] <gnarf> Krinkle_: you can get past the auth page
[10:29:54] <gnarf> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/dashboard.php ?
[10:30:03] <gnarf> oh boo
[10:30:04] <gnarf> that broke
[10:30:35] <gnarf> the graph data collector broke a few weeks ago, and s5fs and I haven't gotten around to the replacement of that tool yet
[10:30:42] <gnarf> what do you want to know, I have other ways  to get that data?
[10:31:53] <gnarf> Krinkle_: sending you a PM with some charts
[10:32:36] <gnarf> looks like the machine started to get hammered with cpu/bandwidth and then got shutdown/blocked by (mt)
[10:34:22] <gnarf> Krinkle_: sorry , thats a digitalocean box
[10:34:25] <gnarf> doing a hard reset now
[10:34:33] <gnarf> couldn't console to it either
[10:37:22] <gnarf> looks ok after a reboot cc Krinkle_ m_gol, Krinkle_: if you get a chance to do some looking at logs to see what might of caused that disk io spike - lmk, I can't do forensics atm
[10:41:07] <m_gol> gnarf: thx

[11:18:35] <m_gol> Krinkle: TestSwarm recognizes Edge as Edge 12 even if I don't provide version number. The version should be removed (even build number would be better than 12)

[13:23:27] <Krinkle> gnarf: Hm.. how can I purge a url from cloudfare?
[13:23:35] <Krinkle> it's a bit annoying that testswarm css is cached for like 24 hours
[13:24:26] <Krinkle> Or are we doing that on purpose somewhere? Either way a way to purge would be nice. Coudl also add a cache buster to testswarm (e.g. first 8 characters of sha1 hash of file)
[13:26:21] <Krinkle> ?reload=? doesn't seem to be working
[13:26:29] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/HEAD/modules/jquery/templates/nginx/purge.erb
[13:26:47] <Krinkle> I guess that's for maxcdn, and not cloudfare
[13:28:28] <Krinkle> Ah, yeah, we're sending 24h expire headers from our own nginx
[13:51:13] <gnarf> Krinkle: purge is kind of a pain, I want to abstract that, it requires logging into cloudflare
[13:51:15] <gnarf> i got ya
[13:52:01] <gnarf> Krinkle: cache should be disabled
[13:52:06] <gnarf> for 3 hrs
[13:52:40] <Krinkle> gnarf: swarm/css/testswarm.css has a 24h expiry per our nginx config
[13:52:44] <Krinkle> and cloudfare honours that
[13:52:55] <Krinkle> but it means when I do a hard refresh, I still hit cloudfare cache
[13:53:10] <gnarf> I put it in development mode, cloudflare is not caching for the next 3 hrs
[13:53:18] <Krinkle> gnarf: Oh, thanks.
[13:53:22] <Krinkle> It's done now though :)
[13:53:51] <Krinkle> I've patched TestSwarm to include a version query, and I recommend we extend our expiry for static resources from 24h to a week or more.
[13:54:06] <Krinkle> although it's hardly a concern for TestSwarm
[14:17:59] <Krinkle> gnarf: I'm happy to revert that patch if you feel it'd be bad. I just prefer to have to manually purge each resource (even if there'd be an easy way to do that) when deploying from git.
[14:18:11] <Krinkle> this should give us the best of both
[14:18:33] <gnarf> nope - week seems fine for statics
