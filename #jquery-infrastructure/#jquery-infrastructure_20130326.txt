[17:07:15] <JamesMGreene> ryanneufeld gnarf et al: Others are complaining of infrastructure dilemmas in #jquery-dev. Thought you might be interested to know: for PhantomJS, MediaTemple just offered us a beefy bare metal server [which we turned down... sigh...]. Perhaps you can pick it up? ;)
[17:21:13] <JamesMGreene> Specs: bare metal (physical server), 4 x Intel Xeon E5345 @ 2.33GHz, 32GB RAM, 2 x 300G SAS drives "in RAID1", 1G uplink, running Ubuntu Precise (though Chris offered to reimage it with any Linux OS)
[17:51:04] <JamesMGreene> Anyway, get in touch with me or else tell Chris [Lea] that I was lamenting such a great server going to waste
