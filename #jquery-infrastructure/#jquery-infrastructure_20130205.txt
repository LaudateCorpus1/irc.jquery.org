[06:42:24] <faraway> is someone here?
[06:44:58] <faraway> i don't know if it is important to know for you, but i received an email today for social bookmark generator site (http://i-add.info/) they registered the domain jquery-library.com at 27-jan-2013, and i thought it is a little bit strange that they use the name jquery in their domain.

[09:38:01] <johnbender> gnarf: when you say "we are using the REST api now" what do you mean precisely :)
[09:38:10] <johnbender> just that the movement of content onto the CDN does?
[09:38:18] <gnarf> I mean that ?reload uses the REST API now
[09:38:36] <gnarf> though it doesn't seem to be doing its job.. :/
[09:45:02] <gnarf> i guess it is doing its job

[09:50:09] <gnarf> just takes like 4 minutes for a purge to complete apparently
[10:02:01] <danheberden> gnarf / clarkbox where is the irc stuff located at?
[10:02:04] <danheberden> that logs the chans?
[10:02:15] <gnarf> jqlog?
[10:02:18] <gnarf> services.jquery.com
[10:02:22] <gnarf> a znc
[10:03:20] <danheberden> ah, an older machine i presume
[10:03:24] <danheberden> no puppet
[10:03:34] <danheberden> oh wait
[10:03:38] <danheberden> i was on jq02, lol
[10:04:02] <danheberden> oh wow, haven't used jqadmin in SO long
[10:07:15] <gnarf> yeah
[10:07:23] <gnarf> need to get that onto new boxes some day
[10:24:27] <johnbender> gnarf: ah very nice. Thanks for handling that :)
[20:29:28] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox gnarf Seems that eol2 isn't in splunk
[20:29:33] <ryanneufeld> is this intentional?
