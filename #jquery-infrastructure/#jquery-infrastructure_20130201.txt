[10:34:17] <gnarf> anyone around?
[10:34:53] <gnarf> (mt) has asked me to either a) install fail2ban, or b) change our SSH port to a non-standard one.  Apparently we are receiving a lot of failed ssh connection attempts, and they are concerned.
[10:35:03] <gnarf> botnets being botnets
[10:36:31] <gnarf> I think non-standard ssh would end up just being a pain in the ass for anyone who actually needs to use the services
[10:36:33] <gnarf> so...
[11:24:12] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: is there any way to stay logged into splunk?
[11:50:13] <clarkbox> jzaefferer i can up the session timeout
[11:50:19] <clarkbox> 24hrs good enough?
[12:04:38] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: I prefer no session timeout, via "remember me" checkbox or just default. But longer timeout would help, too
[12:06:35] <clarkbox> can't do anything more than increase session time. ill up it to 24hrs
[12:13:47] <clarkbox> or 48 even!
[15:32:12] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: cats are out of the office next week, so this mouse will be available to play if you want to work on the backups
