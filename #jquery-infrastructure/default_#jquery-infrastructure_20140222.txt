[04:46:15] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: Yup, I've got emails :-)
[04:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> I forgot that Trac doesn't send emails for your own comments by default. I have it set to send me an email for everything.
[10:57:02] <ryanneufeld> did znc crap out?
[11:08:37] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: not sure
[11:08:52] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: hard to tell the difference between znc sucking and freenode sucking
[12:02:18] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: haha, yeah I suppose
[12:04:09] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: seems like maybe it was freenode this time but idk
[12:04:20] <ryanneufeld> yeah, likely
[12:07:15] <s5fs> whatchu doing today?
[22:43:44] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: there is a config flag for that. you can make it always email all participants of the conversation including yourself.
[22:45:52] <s5fs> nacin: does the config flag only affect one user at a time or system-wide?
[22:45:58] <nacin> system wide.
[22:46:18] <nacin> but we also implemented our own notifications system last month and ditched CC's.
[22:47:15] <s5fs> interesting
[22:48:31] <nacin> it actually happens to use WordPress heavily in part because we valued maintainability for us over portability for others. We also have WordPress.org accounts to play with - versus Trac's anything-goes setup.
[22:48:58] <nacin> I don't know a ton about Trac, but I do know how to bend it in the directions we need. We re-styled the whole thing, sync email addresses with WordPress.org users, use WordPress.org cookies for authentication, hack the hell out of it for our workflow needs. We also in near-real-time cross-reference every IRC mention of a ticket back to the ticket, etc. There's a ton of stuff here: http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/trac/
[22:49:52] <ryanneufeld> that sounds pretty cool nacin
[22:50:03] <s5fs> i'm just getting wound into our trac install, all this info is really good stuff, thanks
[22:50:31] <s5fs> nacin: i like the integration with WordPress.org, that's nice
[22:50:45] <nacin> seamless is important. otherwise it's a barrier to entry.
[22:51:29] <s5fs> agreed
[22:52:09] <nacin> We also hack some pretty crazy reports. long live SQL.
[22:52:21] <s5fs> if it's a hassle nobody will use it, or they'll bitch constantly
[22:52:26] <nacin> I'm out for now, but generally I'm happy to provide any feedback and point you in the right direction. Chances are, I've done the research on whatever you might have questions on. Trac is not amazing, but we've found we can smooth out the rougher edges enough to make it far better than alternatives.
[22:53:20] <nacin> We also moved it from SQLite to MySQL, which made it a bit slower but also meant we could get its data so easily from WordPress. So for example we now have things like http://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/ and http://make.wordpress.org/core/components/ and http://make.wordpress.org/core/components/query/
[22:53:22] <ryanneufeld> nacin: I recall we added some indexes to the trac tables way back at the summit
[22:54:35] <nacin> oh, possibly. Trac's MySQL support sucks so I actually wrote a new optimized schema by hand. https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/trac.wordpress.org/db/mysql-schema.sql - there's a single known bug in there, don't use it without asking first :-)
[22:54:40] <s5fs> nacin: awesome, i appreciate the help and will most certainly be picking your brain!
[22:54:50] <nacin> By default it makes every text field a TEXT field, I went through and figured out each of them.
[22:54:57] <ryanneufeld> holy shit man, that's pretty cool
[22:55:21] <nacin> yeah, I spent about a month over the holidays working on just tools.
[22:55:24] <nacin> thanks sirs.
[22:55:57] <ryanneufeld> nacin|away: I know that feeling man. We had none at work till I built them 
[22:56:52] <s5fs> nacin|away: neat change, sql tuning is fun stuff
[22:57:00] <s5fs> really cool
