[08:01:50] <gnarf> ajpiano: jquery.org is the cert
[08:02:25] <gnarf> its just all hosted on one box so when you hit https://jquery.com - it connects and gives the jquery.org cert
[08:02:39] <gnarf> something I've been meaning to fix for way too long
[08:03:04] <gnarf> s5fs: care to tag along on this process later?
[09:04:57] <ajpiano> ok, so there is something to fix is all i need to know :p
