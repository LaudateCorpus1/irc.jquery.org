[11:19:09] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you around?
[17:52:04] <clarkbox> i am tormented by all these 404's. ryanneufeld, did you say, the reason we are seeing all these is because our CDN does not cache 404's? so… if we can turn a '404' into a '200', we will not be hit by this?
[17:52:45] <clarkbox> if thats a case, like, almost all 404's can be cut out if we put in a redirect for jqueryui.com/themeroller/images/*
[17:54:34] <clarkbox> OR… it seems we moved those assets people are looking for over to "old.jqueryui.com". if we can bring those assets from that host, it would be win-win. users get assets they are after, and our source servers are not hit
