[06:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> We're having some serious issues with jq01.
[06:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> At least I assume the problems are with jq01.
[06:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> Slow page loads for sites and occassional 502.
[06:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> holy shit: load average: 24.58, 23.77, 23.49

[08:27:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez - that jquery mobile commit just went to live
[08:27:22] <gnarf> should i back that out or are we ok?
[08:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> It might cause some errors, but it should be fine.
[08:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> I actually need to talk to you about that.
[08:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't we discuss a change to the API deployment?
[08:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> Like we were going to have api.whatever.com/x.y/ even for the latest version.
[08:29:42] <scott_gonzalez> I forget exactly what we decided.
[08:30:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez we needed to check with nacin
[08:30:40] <gnarf> what we wanted was for the "latest" version to work
[08:30:55] <gnarf> so yeah api.whatever.com/x.y/ === api.whatever.com/
[08:31:13] <gnarf> i almost think it should just be a rewrite
[08:31:20] <gnarf> that removes 1.4
[08:31:23] <gnarf> for instance
[08:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> If we do it as a rewrite, we'd need to update puppet on every major version of UI or Mobile.
[08:31:41] <gnarf> we wanted to be able to link to it as 1.4/whatever
[08:31:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez we already need to add a new version deployer for every major
[08:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok
[08:32:20] <gnarf> but i think we wanted the "real" thing to be without the version if it was latest
[08:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:32:31] <gnarf> so that people linking to docs linked to them without a version
[08:32:40] <gnarf> but we could if we were so inclined have a version specified
[08:32:58] <gnarf> not sure the best way to handle it
[08:33:02] <gnarf> maybe nacin has an idea
[08:33:10] <gnarf> perhaps the wp config could handle this
[08:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Another thing that would be nice is to have api.jquerymobile.com/1.4/ right now, while they're in beta.
[08:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> So / would still be 1.3, since it's latest, but /1.4/ would be available for people testing the beta.
[08:34:34] <gnarf> sure
[08:35:05] <gnarf> load avg down to 6 again
[08:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:35:19] <gnarf> gonna let this run for a bit and look at the hour number
[08:35:43] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1Q3u0G2k3z0T
[08:36:01] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/2209f878589693779dd5fff758f9d3156f56288f think about that for a second though
[08:36:12] <gnarf> that difference was crippling :)
[14:40:20] <s5fs> gnarf: geez
