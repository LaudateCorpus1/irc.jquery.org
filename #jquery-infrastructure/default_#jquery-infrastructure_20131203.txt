[07:48:46] <arschmitz> damn time zones and it not even being 8am yet on the west coast
[08:05:22] <gnarf> i think this is just load...
[08:05:26] <gnarf> which doesn't make much sense
[08:05:35] <gnarf> this isn't as bad traffic wise as last week
[08:26:28] <gnarf> nacin: scott_gonzalez: I think I might be on to something w/ the load
[08:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> oh good

[08:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well that made a huge difference.
[09:07:30] <gnarf> cc s5fs ^ - This was quite a dramatic drop in CPU load :) http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=4ad1ad208484c12e&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10055&graphid=407
[09:29:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: heh look at that graph :)
[09:29:42] <scott_gonzalez> damn
[09:36:06] <gnarf> that was a lot of .gif requests
[09:36:17] <gnarf> i'm glad i added the "cache:0,0" to requests that go through php :)
[09:36:19] <ryanneufeld> so it was passing all files through php?
[09:36:24] <gnarf> i was like, why are gif's php!?
[09:36:36] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: it was passing anything not png css or js through to php
[09:36:36] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that seems wrong
[09:36:39] <gnarf> check the first commit
[09:36:43] <ryanneufeld> oh jeebus
[09:37:03] <ryanneufeld> oiy vey
[09:37:15] <gnarf> i made it so that any non php ext doesn't go through php now
[09:38:14] <ryanneufeld> yeah, thats probably a good thing
[09:51:58] <gnarf> kind of interesting though: http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=4ad1ad208484c12e&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10055&graphid=407
[09:52:13] <gnarf> seems the problem only became a BIG problem sometime near the end of last week
[10:56:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you see the stage deploy failures just not for jquery-wp-content?
[10:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> 403 status code
[10:57:09] <gnarf> whats that mean?
[10:58:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: manual deploy worked
[10:58:40] <gnarf> must of been a github hiccup
[10:59:12] <gnarf> orange "problems with git" https://status.github.com/
[11:00:22] <gnarf> though you mentioning that makes me want to make a "failed" test for the deploy scripts
[11:00:38] <gnarf> so that i can filter the failures out of the "dump it into this label" message :)
[11:09:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be good.
[11:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> I hate having to open the email and scroll to the bottom.
[11:51:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf nacin: We still don't have a working writable directory for uploads for jquery.com. What's the plan for fixing this?
[11:56:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'll add "uploads" to the list of folders ensured writable under jquery-wp-content just in case

[12:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, I'll update the database to use the default again.
[12:02:51] <gnarf> in the meantime, we should try to make sure we don't end up using blogs.dir again
[12:03:05] <gnarf> and might want to add an empty "uploads" gitignore'd folder 
[12:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> Manaully redeployed jquery.org and jquery.com.
[12:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> We now have corporate sponsors on jquery.com.
[12:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> s/sponsors/members/
[12:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I have an uploads directory locally, but it doesn't show up as an untracked file in git.
[12:17:49] <gnarf> directories aren't files 
[12:17:52] <gnarf> thats why
[12:17:58] <gnarf> empty directory in git = completely ignored
[12:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I didn't know that.
[12:18:10] <gnarf> there is a reason there is a .gitignore hiding inside the one inside of blogs.dir
[12:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[12:18:38] <gnarf> git doesn't track directories at all (well, in the sense that each file could be in one...)
[12:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> So in that case, shouldn't the root .gitignore not include blogs.dir?
[12:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> And blogs.dir would just contain .gitignore and the contents of that would be "*"
[12:19:10] <gnarf> probably? I dunno
[12:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna try that.
[12:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that works.
[12:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna do that for blogs.dir and uploads.
[12:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> HAHA, what a pain.
[12:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> I made the uploads dir, and created an empty .gitignore in it.
[12:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> It shows up as an untracked directory.
[12:22:54] <scott_gonzalez> I add * to the .gitignore and it no longer shows up as untracked.
[12:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> So I need to add it while it was empty.
[12:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> Then add the * and it shows up as modified.
[12:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/c4518f7def440ebc6d4e62b9b00e298eb0891d6f
[12:31:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just add the .gitignore
[12:31:30] <gnarf> :)
[12:31:53] <gnarf> works for me
[12:32:00] <gnarf> the deploy work ok?
[12:32:20] <gnarf> im heading out for a super late lunch
[12:32:26] <gnarf> be back in an hour or so
[12:32:43] <scott_gonzalez> The main .gitignore got quite a bit smaller. This is what it looked like when I opened it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/d46cfbcb032cefbc90d7ed80a7c4b1808e3a7816/.gitignore
[14:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins site is having git issues: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/2fbc4f1dea7f1cbf6b00
[15:13:43] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: what log file is that from?
[15:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> syslog
[15:41:19] <ryanneufeld> I'm not seeing that in there recently
[15:48:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sounds like maybe someone ran the plugins site as the wrong user?
[15:49:09] <gnarf> also ryanneufeld, plugins thing is on jq02, not plugins.jquery.com (the frontend wordpress)
[15:49:28] <ryanneufeld> oh
[15:49:36] <ryanneufeld> cause that's not confusing :p
[15:51:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think it would work now
[16:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Still not working.
[16:36:43] <scott_gonzalez> Dec  3 16:35:28 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[7572]: Error during retry: Error: Command failed: error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects  fatal: failed to write object fatal: unpack-objects failed
[16:37:40] <gnarf> do you know what the working directory is for that?
[16:38:40] <gnarf> hrm
[16:38:46] <gnarf> its all in /tmp
[16:39:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can i just delete all of these?
[16:39:13] <gnarf> let it fresh clone?
[16:39:31] <gnarf>  /tmp/plugin-repos/github ?
[16:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> No, that'll probably break a lot of stuff.
[16:39:51] <gnarf> so why are they in /tmp ?
[16:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> Because you didn't configure where to store them?
[16:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[16:40:24] <gnarf> well, we should fix that i suppose
[16:40:32] <gnarf> it doesn't clone fresh? it has to have all these repos?
[16:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> There are scripts that clone the repos and there are scripts that expect the repos to already exist.
[16:41:31] <gnarf> doing a chown -R plugins /tmp/plugins-repos
[16:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[16:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to move them somewhere, you can specify `repoDir` in the config.
[16:42:18] <gnarf> how can we move this out of /tmp?
[16:42:52] <gnarf> okay - the config sample shows /tmp
[16:42:59] <gnarf> so i assumed this meant they were actually tmpfiles
[16:43:03] <gnarf> not stuff to stick around
[16:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's no other sane default, is there?
[16:43:44] <gnarf> repos/ ?
[16:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it could default to a directory inside the repo and have it gitignored.
[16:45:20] <gnarf> "repos/" ?
[16:45:46] <gnarf> does this also mean i should back these up?
[16:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to back them up. If the server dies, the restore script will re-clone everything.
[16:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> But if you delete them while their are actions queued, it might break.
[16:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, if the server were to die today, the restore script would fail almost instantly :-/
[16:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> I need to get back to https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/pull/142
[16:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> And fix all the underlying issues.

[16:53:51] <gnarf> this copy takes a while
[16:54:16] <gnarf> i assume if there are no messages in syslog while i'm copying i'm good to kill/restart it?
[16:54:28] <gnarf> with new config?
[17:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> Should be.
[17:05:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you test it somehow? :)
[17:06:01] <gnarf> i just brought it all back up with repos
[17:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Not without publishing something :-P
[17:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> I can watch the log for a bit.
[17:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> Gah, why doesn't nodeunit recurse into subdirectories to find tests?!?
[17:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> Wow. The feature request has been open for 3 years.
[17:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/issues/48
[17:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's nuts.
[17:10:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez hrm
[17:11:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: my battery is on E
[17:11:48] <gnarf> if it is broken - google hangouts / text message me
[17:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[17:12:02] <gnarf> i'll find power
[17:12:06] <gnarf> otherwise, im done for the day ;)
[17:13:19] <gnarf> the chown seems to have fixed the retry error though?
[17:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, retries are working.
[17:16:39] <gnarf> clarkbox: can we have splunk let us know to chown -R plugins /var/www/plugins/repos/ on jq02 when https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20plugins.jquery.com%20Error%20during%20retry%3A%20Error%3A%20Command%20failed%3A%20error%3A%20insufficient%20permission&earliest=-7d%40h&latest=now happens?
[17:17:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also - potentially more fault tolerant idea for that
[17:17:30] <gnarf> if there is any error at all, try to delete it and re-clone
[17:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> Deleting on any error just seems like it'd make a temporary problem even worse.
[17:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> For example, when GitHub decides to have errors, we'd be potentially deleting lots of repos as we encounter errors.
[17:19:34] <gnarf> sure
[17:19:43] <gnarf> i concede
[17:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> The recovery from those will grow larger as we try to re-clone instead of just rertrying.
[17:19:52] <gnarf> chances are if its an owner problem, delete doesn't work anyway
[17:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> What we need is a notification when the retry script hits its maximum timeout, which is 2 minutes.
[17:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> It gradually backs off on retries until it hits 2 minutes, then it retries every 2 minutes forever.
[17:20:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if you can make an api endpoint to report the current retry time
[17:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably log the number of consecutive retry failures and have splunk notify us when it reaches a threshold.
[17:21:03] <gnarf> i can graph it in zabbix
[17:21:06] <gnarf> and hang alerts off of it
[17:21:38] <gnarf> get me a shell script (or even curl) to output any number, and i can monitor it with zabbix
[17:22:58] <gnarf> I guess "E" lasts longer than I thought it would ;)
[17:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> That shouldn't be too hard.
[17:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> The number of consecutive failures is stored in sqlite.
[17:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> So we can expose an endpoint to get that.
[17:24:21] <gnarf> can we just pull it out via sqllite?
[17:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/154
[17:25:44] <gnarf> what is the query to get me the #?
[17:27:39] <gnarf> hrm
[17:27:41] <gnarf> interesting
[17:27:47] <gnarf> you could graph a few things here
[17:28:00] <gnarf> # of retries waiting, MAX(failures) ?
[17:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> sqlite3 retry.db "SELECT COALESCE(MAX( tries ), 0) FROM retry; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retry;"
[17:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> Prints out 2 lines, each with one number.
[17:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> First line is number of consecutive failures.
[17:33:49] <scott_gonzalez> Second line is number of pending retries.

[17:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think I have a Zabbix login.
[17:53:45] <gnarf> hrm
[17:53:46] <gnarf> let me fix
[17:53:59] <gnarf> i figure our "stats" should probably be public

[17:56:12] <gnarf> all 0's
[17:56:14] <gnarf> but yeah

[17:56:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i can add a user if you want an e-mail when it hits a value
[17:56:33] <gnarf> just let me know what value is the trigger
[17:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> Let's see...the backoff is exponential, starting at 1 second.
[17:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 120
[17:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> So let's just do 10 for both stats.
[17:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> That's 8 minutes of consecutive failing.
[17:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> Or lots of failures queuing up.
