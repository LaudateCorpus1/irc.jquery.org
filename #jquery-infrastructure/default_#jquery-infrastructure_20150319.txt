[04:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs gnarf: I'm looping you in on an email thread with the Trac team. Can we make sure to be reasonably available to answer whatever questions they might have and fill in whatever server admin/puppetizing/whatever that might need to be done for the Trac upgrade?
[04:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently Ryan Ollos from the Trac team was looped into an older thread about this (thanks DaveMethvin|away), but the thread instantly died and he never got to the point of being able to help.
[07:50:01] <gnarf> s5fs: scott_gonzalez: I'll throw a few hours at it tonight possibly w/ s5fs if he's available - What it comes down to is complete lack of knowledge of python and trac and how to debug problems on my part, I barely know where to start, and need to read up on all of the notes we've collected on various email threads where people offered to help.  The thing that gets me is that it every initiative to upgrade trac rarely stays "active" for
[07:50:01] <gnarf>  more than 2 or 3 days and then everything is out of date and a pain again.  I kinda feel like the three of us should do an all hands and try to handle it with ryans help asap
[07:51:18] <gnarf> I'll admit, I haven't been very involved in any of the recent attempts, but I feel like I have bricks for hands when working with it :)
[09:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Well, we have people from the Trac core team willing to help, so all of those problems should be easily solvable.
