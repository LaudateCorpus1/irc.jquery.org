[14:23:29] <clarkbox> gnarf - splunk server seems to be down
[15:37:03] <clarkbox> ryanneufeld
[15:37:09] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: 
[15:37:13] <clarkbox> can you see why that server is down?
[15:37:15] <ryanneufeld> I've ping'd gnarf on skype
[15:37:18] <clarkbox> ok
[15:37:22] <ryanneufeld> what's the address?
[15:37:28] <clarkbox> splunk.jquery.com
[15:37:31] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure I have access to that machine just now
[15:37:40] <clarkbox> its running on the new MT service
[15:37:57] <ryanneufeld> oh, I don't have keys for that yet
[15:38:07] <ryanneufeld> or if I do, i don't know how to use them
[15:38:44] <clarkbox> ok thanks anyway
[15:39:06] <ryanneufeld> Sorry..
[22:16:57] <ajpiano> jqueryui.com is down :/
[22:17:39] <ajpiano> oh god
[22:17:41] <ajpiano> everything is down
[22:17:45] <ajpiano> jquery.com, qunitjs.com
[22:17:49] <ajpiano> gnarf: yt ?
[22:28:04] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano, danheberden, gnarf ping
[22:28:19] <ajpiano> i just texted gnarf
[22:28:33] <ryanneufeld> seems the box is responding to ssh, but I'm not able to login...
[22:28:44] <ryanneufeld> Perhaps a phone call is more prudent?
[22:29:11] <ajpiano> he's either got his phone or he doesn't >:|
[22:29:22] <ryanneufeld> or he's asleep
[22:29:25] <ajpiano> right
[22:29:30] <danheberden> i'm not sure what to do
[22:29:33] <danheberden> if i could do anything?
[22:29:34] <ajpiano> gnarf is never sleeping at this time
[22:29:42] <danheberden> i can reboot boxes or contact support via mt
[22:29:53] <ajpiano> probably a reboot would be the quickest thing to do to start
[22:30:02] <ajpiano> not sure which box it is where everything's live
[22:31:04] <danheberden> this could also be an (mt) error
[22:31:22] <ajpiano> possibly
[22:31:27] <ryanneufeld> do they have a status page?
[22:31:44] <ryanneufeld> http://status.mediatemple.net/
[22:31:57] <ryanneufeld> http://status.mediatemple.net/maintenances/scheduled-maintenance-for-multiple-host-servers-december-6th/
[22:32:01] <ryanneufeld> Maintenance window?
[22:32:14] <ryanneufeld> it's currently 10:30 PT
[22:32:29] <ajpiano> the thing about december 11th
[22:32:34] <ajpiano> is that it isn't december 6th
[22:32:45] <ajpiano> :(
[22:32:49] <danheberden> load is 14
[22:32:49] <ryanneufeld> dec 10th :p
[22:33:00] <ryanneufeld> that's fairly high
[22:33:10] <danheberden> though it's 16 cores yeah?
[22:33:22] <ryanneufeld> on 16 cores... no
[22:33:25] <ryanneufeld> that's normal
[22:33:31] <ryanneufeld> nominal I'd say
[22:33:34] <ryanneufeld> but something is up
[22:33:40] <ryanneufeld> can you reboot?
[22:33:43] <danheberden> aye
[22:34:00] <danheberden> initiated
[22:36:40] <ryanneufeld> what's the word danheberden?
[22:36:57] <danheberden> still pending reboot
[22:37:17] <ryanneufeld> might have to wait for a timeout before a hard reboot
[22:37:22] <ryanneufeld> balls
[22:37:41] <danheberden> there's also a queueing process, so the web page says anyway
[22:38:29] <ryanneufeld> joy
[22:38:48] <ryanneufeld> it shouldn't have to provision though right?
[22:39:38] <danheberden> theoretically, no - i'm not completely up to speed on their internal infrastructure though
[22:40:14] <ryanneufeld> I'm referring to puppet, a simple reboot wouldn't warrant a puppet provisioning. Though it would likely run anyway
[22:40:59] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/74ff1711e8b21ff5affa
[22:41:03] <ryanneufeld> is that the right IP?
[22:41:14] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/c6f073.png
[22:41:31] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: yes
[22:42:06] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: Domain mapping issue. You have web-base-template configured for stage.jquery.com. when I hit stage.api.jquery.com
[22:42:41] <ryanneufeld> wait, I'm a dipshit, I had a trailing period
[22:43:04] <ryanneufeld> so far, it seems that only jq01 went down?
[22:43:12] <ajpiano> yeah it seems like stage is fine
[22:43:44] <ryanneufeld> I can ssh into citadel
[22:47:39] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: danheberden I dunno if there is anything more i can do right now... I can PM my phone number if you want
[22:50:30] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: sure, though i'm not totally aware of what to do either
[22:50:40] <ajpiano> yeah, i am not really sure what to do either
[22:50:41] <danheberden> i'll get a hold of mt to see why it's not rebooting
[22:51:05] <ryanneufeld> well, if it doesn't come back after rebooting, I dunno what to do
[22:51:27] <ryanneufeld> I can fix broken servers as long as I can get into them, But this MT stuff is outside my wheelhouse by a mile
[22:52:27] <danheberden> we'll see what we can conjure up
[22:53:38] <danheberden> it's showing load at 21 now
[22:53:43] <danheberden> i think that it can't reboot
[22:54:33] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/7270.png
[22:55:27] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: yikes
[22:55:44] <ajpiano> :o
[22:56:30] <ryanneufeld> I'm having my own internal server issues myself... my file server's HDD's are screaming now
[22:56:32] <ryanneufeld> :S
[22:57:18] <ajpiano> when lots of strangers around the wolrd start tweeting about it let me know :(
[22:59:08] <ryanneufeld> still no reboot on the server?
[22:59:15] <danheberden> no, load is just climbing
[22:59:18] <danheberden> waiting for a support rep
[23:04:59] <danheberden> i suppose this is a good time to poke the "two proxy servers" bear
[23:05:00] <danheberden> heh
[23:05:21] <danheberden> (mt) is looking at it
[23:10:01] <ajpiano> hopefully they will figure it out :(
[23:10:12] <danheberden> yay unable to retreive stats
[23:10:15] <danheberden> that's a good sign
[23:12:59] <danheberden> "reboot has been initiated. its going through checks and on its way back up"
[23:13:42] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: i'ill probably need some help make sure whatever process ran away doesn't do that again
[23:14:07] <ryanneufeld> my guess is a git checkout
[23:14:58] <ryanneufeld> that was causing problems on another server
[23:16:43] <danheberden> looks like we're back
[23:16:43] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: 
[23:16:51] <danheberden> i can ssh
[23:17:20] <ryanneufeld> as can I
[23:17:28] <danheberden> zabbix is running
[23:17:47] <ryanneufeld> or at least I could
[23:18:15] <ryanneufeld> jqueryui.com is back up
[23:18:24] <ryanneufeld> as is jquery.com
[23:18:25] <danheberden> i can't hold a ssh - they are still doing stuff
[23:20:17] <danheberden> all clear, they say
[23:20:20] <ryanneufeld> php5-fpm is using a-lot of cpu
[23:20:50] <danheberden> yeah it is
[23:20:58] <ryanneufeld> is that normal?
[23:21:09] <danheberden> not entirely sure
[23:21:23] <danheberden> "admin is gonna keep a specific watch on it for a while, just in case of any recurrence"
[23:22:10] <ryanneufeld> k, just installed htop
[23:22:15] <ryanneufeld> only showing 4cpus
[23:22:27] <danheberden> 4 cpu's with 4 cores each, yeah?
[23:22:48] <ryanneufeld> no, htop shows each core
[23:22:54] <ryanneufeld> and it's only showing 4
[23:22:57] <ryanneufeld> and i got booted
[23:23:00] <danheberden> weird
[23:23:18] <clarkbox> splunk _could_ help right nowâ€¦ 
[23:23:37] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: yeah, it's only showing 4cpus
[23:24:01] <danheberden> cpu is back to normal though at least
[23:24:27] <ryanneufeld> load is 1.1
[23:24:30] <ryanneufeld> that's good
[23:24:54] <danheberden> maybe it's just 4 cores then
[23:24:56] <danheberden> i could be wrong
[23:25:08] <danheberden> i know it's 4 xeon cpu's
[23:25:11] <danheberden> which cpuinfo reports
[23:25:43] <danheberden> but maybe it's just one and it's quad core
[23:26:19] <ryanneufeld> yeah, each one would show up
[23:26:21] <clarkbox> if MT/gnarf can get splunk server running, we can see if the value has changed
[23:27:30] <ryanneufeld> aight, I'm gonna header to bed
[23:27:45] <danheberden> clarkbox: is that a service on the box?
[23:28:01] <clarkbox> its on a host by itself
[23:28:07] <danheberden> oh gotcha
[23:28:12] <clarkbox> on the "new" architecture 
[23:28:20] <danheberden> man when php-fpm runs, it REALLY runs
[23:28:27] <clarkbox> helix i think
