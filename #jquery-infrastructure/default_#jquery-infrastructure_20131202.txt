[11:52:27] <s5fs> gnarf: thanks for fixing nacin
[11:52:40] <nacin> I was broken :(
[11:53:14] <s5fs> nacin: yeah i broke you a while ago
[11:53:18] <s5fs> "i broke him"
[12:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you see that production deploy failure?
[12:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like a problem with git.
[12:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> I got this when trying to deploy manually:
[12:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> fatal: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/info/refs not found: did you run git update-server-info on the server?
[12:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, hmm...guess that's a GitHub issue.
[12:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> I just can't win today.
[12:24:43] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: chin up, it'll be okay

[13:28:21] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 14aad98d6 15Corey Frang: new password hash for nacin

[13:31:51] <s5fs> gnarf: how are you generating the hash?
[13:32:08] <gnarf> s5fs: by forcing them to change the password then grep username /etc/shadow
[13:32:34] <gnarf> grep nacin /etc/shadow | cut -f2 -d:
[13:32:37] <gnarf> for instance
[13:32:44] <nacin> aye
[13:32:45] <s5fs> right
[13:32:56] <s5fs> nacin: so you just logged in and changed your pwd?
[13:33:10] <nacin> and then asked gnarf to update the puppet config with the new hash
[13:33:14] <gnarf> well, this time i had to set his passwd to something he would know so he could change it :)
[13:33:39] <s5fs> haha okay okay, but the process is the same. i'll do a little wiki write-up on new user provisioning when i get a few minutes
[13:33:58] <s5fs> i know there's been interest in this before
[13:34:19] <s5fs> also, hi nacin!
[13:34:41] <gnarf> s5fs: the default user password (if you don't set a hash) is in https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/user/manifests/virtual.pp#L26
[13:35:03] <s5fs> fancy
[13:35:40] <gnarf> s5fs: also note, there was a "shell" option on the virtual user - we could have just set that to /bin/false for nacin :)
[13:36:38] <s5fs> that was discussed
[13:40:46] <s5fs> not sure why i deleted the guy but hey, probably made sense at the time
[13:44:14] <gnarf> s5fs: also, some decent infra related knowledge in -content today ;)
[14:19:51] <s5fs> gnarf: high cpu on jq01, sitting around 90% atm
[14:20:06] <gnarf> s5fs: yeah that machine is cooking most of the time
[14:20:22] <gnarf> though it seems more than normal right now
[14:20:41] <s5fs> agreed, i'm responding to zabbix
[14:22:06] <gnarf> i think this is right around "peak" time
[14:23:20] <s5fs> cyber monday maybe? haha
[14:23:27] <s5fs> all jquery code half off
[14:26:47] <s5fs> gnarf: heh, we should probably delete old nginx access logs from jq01
[14:30:26] <s5fs> okay i'll just hang back until something breaks. i'll try to push thru the trac upgrade quickly and then circle around on spliting up wordpress
