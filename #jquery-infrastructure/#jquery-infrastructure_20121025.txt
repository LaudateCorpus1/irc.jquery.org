[06:59:56] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: are we using the git version of ZNC?
[08:26:50] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: no, latest stable i think
[08:54:08] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ah, the latest git supports the same username on multiple servers :)

[14:43:43] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: around?
[14:43:53] <gnarf> sup
[14:44:09] <ryanneufeld> just noticed a [stage] section in the puppet conf
[14:44:13] <ryanneufeld> wassat for?
[14:44:53] <ryanneufeld> I see that there is a second set of configs. So does that mean that puppet supports staging of configs?
[14:45:07] <ryanneufeld> or is that a config for the staging servers to talk to?
[14:45:11] <ryanneufeld> *pull from
[14:45:50] <gnarf> yes
[14:45:59] <ryanneufeld> to which part?
[14:46:04] <gnarf> the stage environment
[14:46:08] <gnarf> reads from the stage folder
[14:46:10] <ryanneufeld> ah
[14:46:11] <gnarf> for the stage servers
[14:46:11] <ryanneufeld> okay
[14:46:30] <ryanneufeld> so when you configure puppet agent you tell it to look for the stage config
[14:46:31] <ryanneufeld> cool
[14:46:45] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[15:02:46] <Krinkle> clarkbox: ping
[15:02:57] <clarkbox> yo
[15:02:58] <b-ot> clarkbox, you have 2 new messages, say “read” to me when you wish to read them.
[15:03:03] <clarkbox> read
[15:03:15] <clarkbox> b-ot read
[15:03:15] <b-ot> clarkbox, from Krinkle, 4mon 1w ago: testswarm-browserstack had an issue that was causing testswarm to trip up. Fixed in https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/pull/24 For now deployed on swarm01 through remote 'krinkle'. After you pulled, feel free to reset the remote to 'origin' on swarm01.
[15:03:20] <b-ot> clarkbox, from gnarf, 1d 23h ago: Want to ask you about splunk covering an "alarm in IRC" use case
[15:03:25] <b-ot> clarkbox, from Krinkle, 1d 21h ago: Regarding your offer to check out splunk at Wikimedia, I'm interested to see how "IRC notifications" would work as well.
[15:03:56] <Krinkle> lol, 4 months ago
[15:04:00] <Krinkle> ignore that ;P
[15:04:01] <clarkbox> ya. wow
[15:04:11] <clarkbox> thanks for the notice bot
[15:04:32] <clarkbox> i should have notifications running by the weekend
[15:04:35] <clarkbox> been busy at work
[15:04:47] <Krinkle> clarkbox: just wanted to tell you that I brought up Splunk at Wikimedia. Its up to them now to decide whether they want to use/try it.
[15:04:54] <clarkbox> cool
[15:04:59] <clarkbox> let me know if you have any questions
[15:05:55] <Krinkle> regardless of how it will turn out, thanks for the offer. Again, I know its in Splunk's interest as well to get big names on the wall, but still its a nice gesture to care about open-source, more companies should be like that.
[15:06:08] <Krinkle> I'll bring you in touch if they want to pursue it further.
[15:06:42] <clarkbox> yes i can't promise anything - but i will try and swing you guys a not for profit license
[15:06:52] <clarkbox> if you need it
[15:09:30] <Krinkle> clarkbox: right now we're on nagios and ganglia for operations monitoring and notification to irc and cell phones. And Watchmouse as external monitors from a more abstract level (e.g. "url foo works and responds in time")
[15:10:21] <Krinkle> clarkbox: from what I understand, though Splunk is superior in what it can do with the data, it doesn't look for data itself, right?
[15:10:45] <Krinkle> in that it wouldn't go out and pink a mysql slave to see what its replication time is or whatever (like nagios does)
[15:11:18] <clarkbox> there is some overlap there, but that is just one use case for splunk.
[15:11:28] <Krinkle> not that that is bad, just making sure that we would still need a service to get the data (or are there Splunk plugins for getting data as well?)
[15:11:37] <clarkbox> splunk does take care of the data gathering…
[15:11:47] <clarkbox> but just like nagios, you need to write scripts to do stuff
[15:11:54] <Krinkle> Right
[15:11:56] <clarkbox> you could leverage nagios scrips i am sure
[15:12:40] <Krinkle> Right, so it doesn't just take more proccessed information. It can make server requests or ssh connections to get data etc. ?
[15:12:41] <clarkbox> the more interesting use cases for splunk go far beyond server metrics, and monitoring
[15:13:02] <Krinkle> I know it does more than that, but it would be interesting to not have 5 services with different protocols in place
[15:13:10] <Krinkle> but something more splunky :)
[15:13:16] <clarkbox> yes! thats the spirit!
[15:15:01] <Krinkle> ah, interesting (/me reads documentation). So one can make more advanced data gathering scripts in Splunk too. I assumed it was mostly meant to read text data that was provided by other sources.
[15:17:13] <Krinkle> clarkbox: btw, though I guess if/when it is further looked in it will become clear. Is it correct that Splunk does support for advanced gathering scripts (e.g. just like nagios one can have scripts that connect to an apache or mysql server not just to get data, but generate data)
[15:17:44] <Krinkle> e.g. to perform a meta query in msyql to see what the slave replication time is
[15:17:49] <Krinkle> and then use that as the data for the current timestamp
[15:18:31] <Krinkle> oh, /me reads more documentation.
[15:18:32] <Krinkle> nice
[16:40:45] <clarkbox> hey gnarf, looks like the splunk box is down
[16:46:05] <gnarf> clarkbox: not sure what happened to it
[16:46:23] <clarkbox> does the control panel show the status as down?
[16:48:28] <gnarf> yes
[16:48:36] <gnarf> and the grub boot loader seems all f'ed up
[16:48:38] <gnarf> gonna mail them
[17:08:00] <clarkbox> k np. let me know when its back
[17:08:01] <clarkbox> thanks
