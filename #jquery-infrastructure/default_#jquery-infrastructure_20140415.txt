[11:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs: Who wants to help me figure out permissions on one of the servers?
[11:08:21] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I'm on a call atm, but this afternoon or this evening I can
[11:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> heh, looks like someone chown'd instead of chmoding: -rw-r--r--  1 jqadmin       500    53 Feb 10  2012 google3c009b73f0572941.html
[11:10:06] <ryanneufeld> maybe
[11:10:18] <ryanneufeld> do you have sudo?
[11:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:10:31] <ryanneufeld> k
[11:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm wondering who is supposed to own these files.
[11:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> It's a bit of a mess.
[11:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/d710d8bb8bcea368cd58
[11:11:16] <ryanneufeld> whatever the apache user is
[11:11:24] <ryanneufeld> www_data:www_data should work
[11:11:25] <ryanneufeld> afaik
[11:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll chown that whole directory to www-data
[11:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> That's the user I was expecting.
[11:12:02] <ryanneufeld> just fix teh files you know are having issues
[11:12:17] <ryanneufeld> cause the other ones could be generated by scripts/git checkouts right?>
[11:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nothing's having issues. I'm trying to upgrade WP.
[11:12:26] <ryanneufeld> Oh
[11:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to do it via git.
[11:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> But I wanted to know which user to sudo to before doing that.
[11:12:56] <ryanneufeld> oh
[11:13:02] <ryanneufeld> how was it currently done?
[11:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think just a download and unzip.
[11:13:13] <ryanneufeld> we should be able to manage this with puppet at some point shouldn't we?
[11:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's eol2, old blog install.
[11:13:21] <ryanneufeld> oh
[11:13:28] <ryanneufeld> just do it manually, set the user
[11:13:35] <ryanneufeld> and then let it auto upgrade in the future
[11:13:47] <ryanneufeld> which should be www-data, I think
[11:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you think I should just do another download and unzip instead of git?
[11:15:11] <ryanneufeld> or we could migrate the blog to a new server
[11:15:21] <ryanneufeld> and let that EOL box actually end it's life
[11:15:44] <ryanneufeld> for now, I think the simplest thing to do
[11:15:52] <ryanneufeld> is just unzip the wp dir
[11:15:57] <ryanneufeld> like you would for a manual update
[11:16:21] <ryanneufeld> then you can use the updater built in to wp
[11:16:23] <ryanneufeld> up to you
[11:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[11:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> $ sudo curl http://wordpress.org/latest.zip > wordpress.zip
[11:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> -bash: wordpress.zip: Permission denied
[11:16:37] <ryanneufeld> I don't see the advantage of using git
[11:16:52] <ryanneufeld> can you give me a couple hours?
[11:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:17:05] <ryanneufeld> and I'll be able to do a hangout :)
[11:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think blog.jqueryui.com is fully updated now.
[11:51:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the "sudo" part of that earlier command ended at the >
[11:52:08] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[11:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> That would explain it.
[11:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> I ended up just doing `sudo -u root bash`
[11:52:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez thats usually my first command when admining :)
