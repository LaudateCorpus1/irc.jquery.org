[19:16:12] <Krinkle> Aborted http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/stage.events.jquery.org/336/ as it ran for 11 days
[19:21:41] <Krinkle> Upgraded Jenkins Plugin "Timestamper" from 1.5.x to 1.7.x to fix various bugs
[19:23:23] <Krinkle> Disabled legacy and insecure setting for client-side downloading of Jenkins plugins meta data. Instead this happens server-side now (as is upstream default). This legacy setting was for when the server is behind a firewall, which ours isn't.
