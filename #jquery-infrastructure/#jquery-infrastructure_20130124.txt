[07:00:55] <gnarf> hey danheberden - cert?
[07:01:16] <danheberden> gnarf - yes, i need a csr to, like, make one
[07:01:23] <gnarf> danheberden: k
[07:01:30] <gnarf> danheberden: we are jquery.org yes?
[07:01:44] <danheberden> yeah
[07:01:46] <gnarf> are we registering *.jquery.org or just jquery.org
[07:01:55] <danheberden> i didn't get a wildcard one
[07:01:58] <gnarf> k
[07:01:59] <danheberden> so just jquery.org
[07:02:00] <gnarf> csr coming
[07:02:05] <danheberden> yay!
[07:02:06] <danheberden> :D
[07:02:32] <gnarf> 2048 bit?
[07:02:47] <danheberden> i would assume but let me double check
[07:03:18] <danheberden> yes
[07:03:35] <danheberden> so are you just generating the csr manually on the server?
[07:03:39] <danheberden> and then we'll install it via puppet?
[07:04:05] <gnarf> danheberden: yup

[16:52:38] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf, where would I find error logs for the notifier server if I used the same init script and setups the jquery sites use for notifier-server?
[16:56:10] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: syslog
[16:56:32] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: it should output to /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog or whatever the default is
[17:04:44] <ryanneufeld> Thanks
[19:00:31] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez check out view.jqueryui.com now
[19:04:28] <clarkbox> jzaefferer -t does not seem to make any difference 
[19:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: Thanks.
[19:07:47] <clarkbox> did that work? i don't see any new folders (though i am going by bad memory)
[19:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> -t does make a differnece. None of our new tags were available before, because they're not reachable from any branch.
[19:07:57] <clarkbox> ok good
[19:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://view.jqueryui.com/1.9.2/ didn't work before.
[19:17:11] <clarkbox> hey gnarf, shouldn't changes to the web-view-jquery-org repo be pushed out to the view.jquery* sites via puppet (in here this https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/gitview/manifests/init.pp)
[19:17:55] <clarkbox> i am guessing "update => false" might be an issue?
[21:39:43] <gnarf> it doesn't have the script to update it, no
[21:41:31] <gnarf> i suppose it should be?
[21:46:13] <gnarf> I think I was waiting for us to figure out what sort of thing we want to do with that repo
[21:46:21] <gnarf> like, will it be a grunt task, or just a checkout, etc
[21:46:45] <gnarf> for now, just git checkout the latest commit on stage, latest tag on prod?
[21:46:51] <gnarf> clarkbox: ^^^^?
[22:06:19] <clarkbox> will do gnarf
[22:06:39] <gnarf> clarkbox: i think just removing update => false
[22:06:49] <clarkbox> ya...
[22:07:01] <clarkbox> i didn't not try that
[22:07:19] <clarkbox> i will tomorrow. heading out in 10
[22:09:11] <gnarf> clarkbox: i'll need to add post-commit hooks to the repo as well
