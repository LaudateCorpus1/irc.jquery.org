[09:52:12] <ryanneufeld> gnarf, scott_gonzalez, s5fs non jquery opinion question. Suppose you have a git repo that is cloned on a production machine, which is automatically updated. Is it best practice to do something like `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master` assuming that no local edits are happening ever (and if there are, they should be reverted) ?
[09:52:38] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i chose checking out commit shas
[09:52:44] <gnarf> go headless
[09:52:49] <gnarf> git checkout --force abcdef
[09:53:00] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:53:03] <ryanneufeld> so git checkout HEAD?
[09:53:08] <gnarf> nope
[09:53:14] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:53:18] <gnarf> it kinda depends on knowing the sha from your push hook
[09:53:28] <ryanneufeld> we don't have a push hook
[09:53:49] <gnarf> but if you don't perhaps just git fetch; git checkout --force origin/master 
[09:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Your suggestion should work fine.
[09:54:03] <scott_gonzalez> Essentially the same as gnarf's suggestion, assuming you're always using master.
[09:54:08] <gnarf> I just didn't want my local version on the server tracking any branch
[09:54:09] <ryanneufeld> right
[09:54:19] <ryanneufeld> why is that gnarf?
[09:54:22] <gnarf> impossible to accidentially push
[09:54:27] <ryanneufeld> I see
[09:54:32] <gnarf> no reason to commit 
[09:54:41] <gnarf> in fact, makes it a pain in the ass to make a commit from the server
[09:54:47] <gnarf> which is a plus in my mind
[09:55:09] <ryanneufeld> oic
[09:55:39] <ryanneufeld> so something like fetch->revparse origin/master->checkout -f 
[09:55:54] <ryanneufeld> where the checkout would use the sha from the revparse
[09:55:56] <gnarf> nah, checkout -f origin/master goes headless
[09:56:05] <ryanneufeld> oic
[09:56:11] <ryanneufeld> skips a step
[09:56:40] <ryanneufeld> Thanks
[12:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> HTMLHint seems to be arbitrary rules for style conformance.
[12:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> Though it's pretty awesome that it does jshint and csslint checks on inline code.
[12:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, wrong channel.
[14:04:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lol - yeah it was arbitrary, but had the one i cared about 
[14:04:17] <gnarf> so screw it
[14:04:18] <gnarf> :)
[14:04:45] <gnarf> also didn't have to be trained about every ng-attr in the world
[14:06:22] <ryanneufeld> you guys at a conf?
[14:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Nah, gnarf asked a question in #grunt and I replied here.
