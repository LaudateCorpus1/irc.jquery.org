[09:31:55] <rworth> gnarf re https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/31 does web-base-template on stage. auto-deploy from master ?
[09:32:02] <rworth> and then production is only from tags?
[09:32:12] <rworth> not sure where this issue lies
[10:33:36] <ryanneufeld> we still on for meeting in 30mins?
[10:33:50] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: danheberden ^^
[10:42:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: ya
[10:42:56] <ryanneufeld> cool cool
[10:49:02] <gnarf> clarkbox: you around?
[10:50:05] <danheberden> ryanneufeld kind of around but off for the holiday
[10:52:38] <ryanneufeld> oh right
[10:52:49] <ryanneufeld> you 'mericans do the thanks giving a month later
[10:54:14] <ryanneufeld> now I want turkey
[10:55:48] <Krinkle> again
[11:26:54] <ryanneufeld> yes Krinkle, I want turkey, again...
[11:27:20] <Krinkle> poor turkeys, never any rest.
[11:27:33] <Krinkle> boom, awesome: http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/webgl_lights_deferred_pointlights.html
[11:27:39] <Krinkle> (drag and pan around)
[11:58:46] <gnarf> hey ryanneufeld
[11:58:59] <gnarf> can I bump the prio on nginx zabbix stuff up a bit too?
[11:59:09] <gnarf> i really wanna start graphing those values
[11:59:43] <gnarf> also clarkbox - whenever you're around - could you share the URL for splunk / help me get logged in again, I couldn't remember where we moved it last night
[12:00:27] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I think I needed your help to get the right config in puppet for those gnarf, but it should be a simple task once done
[12:22:20] <rworth> gnarf did you see my question above?
[12:37:03] <clarkbox> gnarf its at https://splunk.jquery.com:8000
[12:37:17] <clarkbox> see email i sent a week or two ago
[13:58:20] <Krinkle> There is a constant stream of 404 errors on code.origin.jquery.com/htdocs/jquery-latest.jss
[13:58:26] <Krinkle> someone is liking to jss
[13:58:40] <Krinkle> not sure why that is in error_log (as opposed to access_log)
[13:58:49] <ryanneufeld> cause it's an error
[13:58:50] <Krinkle> presumably because we use an intermediary thing that emits the error?
[13:58:59] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: what's the referrer?
[13:59:11] <Krinkle> if it was just apache serving the file and not finding it, it would just be a 404 error in access_log afai
[13:59:15] <Krinkle> 012/11/21 13:57:41 [error] 27823#0: *998 open() "/var/www/code.origin.jquery.com/htdocs/jquery-latest.jss" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 46.22.66.235, server: code.origin.jquery.com, request: "GET /jquery-latest.jss HTTP/1.1", host: "code.origin.jquery.com", referrer: "http://www.femme-tendance.com/2012/09/7.html"

[13:59:58] <Krinkle> 5,927 events in the last 60 minutes
[14:00:04] <Krinkle> (matching that error)
[14:00:17] <Krinkle>  "/var/www/code.origin.jquery.com/htdocs/jquery-latest.jss"
[14:00:35] <Krinkle> that blog guy is even including jquery twice
[14:01:58] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: ryanneufeld@jq03:/var/www/code.origin.jquery.com/htdocs$ echo "/* Please link to jquery-latest.js */" > jquery-latest.jss
[14:02:05] <ryanneufeld> ?cc
[14:02:05] <b-ot> ryanneufeld, CASE CLOASED!
[14:02:37] <Krinkle> :D
[14:02:51] <Krinkle> so I guess the CDN doesn't cache 404 errors even a little bit
[14:02:56] <ryanneufeld> should i add?
[14:02:57] <ryanneufeld> console.error('Please link to jquery-latest.js');
[14:03:10] <Krinkle> that would break in consoleless browsers
[14:03:32] <Krinkle> which I guess the authro wouldn't even care or notice
[14:03:46] <Krinkle> if you're including jquery twice, for over a month, lucky if he even knows what a console it
[14:03:47] <Krinkle> is
[14:03:48] <ryanneufeld> I could make it an alert
[14:03:53] <Krinkle> yeah, do that :P
[14:04:00] <Krinkle> +1 for self-inflicted cross-site scripting
[14:04:25] <ryanneufeld> cho "/* Please link to jquery-latest.js */ alert('Please link to jquery-latest.js');" > jquery-latest.jss
[14:04:39] <ryanneufeld> at least now it won't 404
[14:06:20] <Krinkle> it doesn't even work
[14:06:23] * ryanneufeld waits for someone to pop up in #jquery
[14:06:23] <Krinkle> http://www.femme-tendance.com/2012/09/7.html
[14:06:28] <Krinkle> has all kinds of syntax errors in the console
[14:06:36] <Krinkle> it doesn't even reach that script tag apparently.
[14:06:38] <ryanneufeld> I get the popup
[14:06:40] <Krinkle> k
[14:07:17] <ryanneufeld> DEAR GOD MY EYES
[14:07:33] <Krinkle> yeah..
[15:14:39] <Krinkle> clarkbox: $.Deferred( 'So I wonder did you create sourcetype="phpfpmerror" or was that automatically created and named?' );
[15:16:56] <clarkbox> yes i did!
[15:21:52] <clarkbox> nice. a XSS for good
[15:21:52] <clarkbox> haha
[16:34:52] <gnarf> Krinkle: im not concerned with the jquery-latest.jss 404 --- 404's are a matter of quick requests for nginx
[16:35:25] <gnarf> we have many more 4xx errors on jqueryui.com that might serve wordpress pages, thats must more costly than the minimilist 404 nginx message :)
[16:35:38] <Krinkle> sure
[16:36:16] <gnarf> but i stopped wondering why people hotlink to broken urls a while back
[16:36:17] <gnarf> :)
[16:36:38] <gnarf> jquery* domains get a shitload of hotlinks
[16:37:34] <Krinkle> clarkbox: I've renamed the file to log/php5-fpm/error.log (to avoid conflicts with php's own logrotate)
[16:37:47] <Krinkle> but ahm.. now splunk wants to use sourcetype=apache_error
[16:37:55] <Krinkle> can you make it use phpfmerror again?
[16:37:58] <Krinkle> now sure how you did th at
[16:38:23] <clarkbox> yes ill fix
[16:38:36] <clarkbox> you would need to add yourself to ssh users on splunk.jquery.com
[16:38:48] <Krinkle> add myself?
[16:38:54] <Krinkle> ah, puppet
[16:38:56] <clarkbox> yea
[16:39:01] <clarkbox> its ok, i can do it
[16:39:10] <clarkbox> but if you want to learn, let me know and ill show you
[16:39:23] <Krinkle> thx
[16:39:27] <Krinkle> I'll learn
[16:39:41] <clarkbox> k, ill PM you a join.me
[16:39:46] <clarkbox> way easier than explaining :)
[16:40:57] <Krinkle> k
[16:46:34] <gnarf> this seems to be running nice over on that server
[16:48:19] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/1fca270d4ce7182f2c200b55710b1a75879cdfa8
[16:48:19] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-master 141fca270 15Timo Tijhof: Add krinkle ssh to splunk
[16:48:56] <Krinkle> clarkbox: ^
[16:49:41] <clarkbox> cool
[16:49:42] <Krinkle> clarkbox: there is no browser.browser if there is browser.device fyi
[16:49:50] <Krinkle> ah, you gotit
[16:50:22] <Krinkle> which is ok
[16:50:26] <Krinkle> maybe don't fill in device ?
[16:50:41] <clarkbox> ah so it would make more sense to have client(aka browser.browser) hold the device field if its empty?
[16:51:24] <Krinkle> Hm.. no, that'll get weird soon
[16:51:42] <Krinkle> default sort as timestamp is ok
[16:51:55] <Krinkle> I assume count can also take null ?
[16:52:07] <Krinkle> in that it counts unique rows as browser,version,os,device
[16:52:11] <Krinkle> even if one of them is null
[16:52:32] <Krinkle> so, I'm ssh'ed into splunk
[16:52:36] <Krinkle> which directory do I rm -rf ?
[16:52:40] <Krinkle> :P
[16:52:41] <clarkbox> haha
[16:52:47] <clarkbox>  /
[16:52:57] <Krinkle> actually, I'm not :(
[16:53:00] <Krinkle> public key denied
[16:53:15] <clarkbox> ok just wait. it will take a while to propagate
[16:53:17] <Krinkle> what is the puppetmaster time on jquery?
[16:53:25] <Krinkle> maybe you can refresh it locally
[16:53:26] <clarkbox> 5 min i think
[16:53:28] <clarkbox> sure
[16:53:47] <clarkbox> k try now
[16:54:09] <Krinkle> (I saw that btw)
[16:54:12] <clarkbox> yaaa
[16:54:12] <Krinkle> nope, still not.
[16:54:18] <clarkbox> i don't know if thats the right command
[16:54:27] <Krinkle> me neither
[16:54:33] <clarkbox> hey gnarf, how do i get puppet to pick up latest configs?
[16:54:39] <clarkbox> puppet agent test?
[16:54:57] <gnarf> puppet agent --test
[16:55:07] <clarkbox> thanks
[16:55:24] <clarkbox> sudo puppet agent --test
[16:55:25] <clarkbox> Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled
[16:55:39] <clarkbox> gnarf ^ thats on splunk box
[16:56:13] <Krinkle>  /etc/puppet/puppet.conf runinterval
[16:56:33] <Krinkle> btw, filed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5314
[16:56:38] <Krinkle> for the notices from mobile docs
[16:56:42] <gnarf> huh? that should work
[16:58:36] <clarkbox> $ hostname
[16:58:37] <clarkbox> debian
[16:58:40] <clarkbox> that shouldn't be?
[17:00:10] <Krinkle> grr. americans screw up my spelling
[17:00:11] <gnarf> it was using the wrong hostname
[17:00:13] <Krinkle> I'd write equivelant
[17:00:16] <gnarf> i switched it up
[17:00:25] <Krinkle> looks like it is actually spelled as equivalent
[17:00:34] <Krinkle> pronounce it that way!
[17:02:24] <Krinkle> still denied public key btw
[17:02:56] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/5e855de037f6512c63711007150f2c9083ca88ee
[17:02:56] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-master 145e855de 15Corey Frang: need to search before you realize
[17:03:03] <gnarf> clarkbox: i just put certname=splunk.jquery.com in the puppet conf
[17:03:04] <gnarf> that fixed it
[17:03:05] <gnarf> also
[17:03:19] <gnarf> you can't realize a resource unless you've "searched" the class its in
[17:03:20] <clarkbox> thanks for your help gnarf
[17:03:48] * Krinkle is in
[17:05:24] <Krinkle> hostname debian?
[17:05:32] <Krinkle> anyhow, back on splunk
[17:06:45] <clarkbox> so we need to modify the inputs.conf file 
[17:06:49] <clarkbox> there are many of them
[17:07:16] <clarkbox> the one we want to edit is in...
[17:07:28] <clarkbox>  /opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps/unix/local
[17:08:27] <clarkbox> you will find a stanza within that file, that has the (old) file name, and declares the source type to use
[18:27:39] <Krinkle> clarkbox: I'm currently watching some Splunk videos and noticed the guy says "And it automatically handles.. .. .. and logrotation by default..."
[18:27:47] <Krinkle> So... is that true in our case as well?
[18:27:52] <clarkbox> ya
[18:28:12] <Krinkle> what about nginx'es default logrotator
[18:28:26] <Krinkle> is that surpressed, or what. do you know more about that?
[18:28:30] <clarkbox> you know it means that it will recognize log rotationâ€¦ and not index the files as duplicate. it does not mean that it will rotate the file for us
[18:29:13] <Krinkle> aha
[18:29:14] <Krinkle> I see
[18:29:17] <Krinkle> "handle"
[18:29:29] <Krinkle> can be intepreted in different ways
[18:29:32] <clarkbox> yes
[18:29:44] <clarkbox> i understand your confusion
[20:02:14] <Krinkle> gnarf: ping
[20:02:32] <gnarf> hey
[20:03:31] <Krinkle> gnarf: So you once told me if I prefer to use ack-grep or vim, an I just install it
[20:03:33] <Krinkle> so I did
[20:03:42] <gnarf> coo
[20:03:43] <Krinkle> then I accidentally installed ack instead of ack-grep
[20:03:49] <Krinkle> so I remove ack again
[20:03:51] <Krinkle> and typed apt
[20:04:03] <Krinkle> I'm not sure how much trouble I'm in.
[20:04:05] <gnarf> removed apt? 
[20:04:06] <gnarf> lol
[20:04:08] <gnarf> which machine?
[20:04:13] <Krinkle> splunk
[20:05:12] <gnarf> dpkg -l | grep apt
[20:05:21] <gnarf> that should give you a list of the packages that were installed there
[20:05:48] <Krinkle> I don't think it removed any packages
[20:05:50] <Krinkle> just itself
[20:06:05] <gnarf> yeah
[20:06:12] <gnarf> those are the apt packages we need back
[20:06:12] <Krinkle> curl, git, vim, ack-grep etc. (where all installed with apt-get I think) are still there
[20:06:20] <gnarf> dpkg can still install it
[20:06:22] <gnarf> but without apt
[20:06:28] <Krinkle> right
[20:06:32] <gnarf> we need to hunt down those .dpkg and install by hand
[20:06:51] <Krinkle> yeah, that list matches the list apt-get remove apt listed during its thing
[20:07:06] <Krinkle> can dpkg install those?
[20:07:14] <gnarf> cool, go find those .dpkg files on the apt-repos
[20:07:21] <gnarf> and dpkg -i em
[20:07:22] <gnarf> :)
[20:07:30] <Krinkle> dpkg -i em <path to file> ?
[20:07:36] <gnarf> dpkg -i filename
[20:07:39] <Krinkle> righ
[20:07:45] <Krinkle> maybe puppet can do this?
[20:07:51] <gnarf> not without apt
[20:07:53] <Krinkle> right
[20:07:55] <gnarf> it uses apt to provide packages
[20:08:18] <Krinkle> so.. I have no idea where to start.
[20:08:47] <Krinkle> I found a unix installer of apt, but not sure if that's it.
[20:08:52] <Krinkle> you seem to suggest a different path
[20:09:01] <Krinkle> http://apst.stsci.edu/apt/external/downloads/installers/install.html
[20:09:25] <Krinkle> http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/python-apt-common
[20:10:32] <Krinkle> That's one of the ones that dpkg command listed
[20:10:48] <Krinkle> so I should download that from there?
[20:10:56] <Krinkle> http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/all/python-apt-common/download
[20:12:06] <Krinkle> k, pulling in with wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/python-apt/python-apt-common_0.7.100.1+squeeze1_all.deb
[20:13:59] <Krinkle> gnarf: for the next one there is too many choices: http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/laptop-detect
[20:14:01] <Krinkle> not sure which one
[20:14:10] <Krinkle> I guess one that ends in 64
[20:14:49] <gnarf> yeah, amd64 kernel build
[20:15:37] <Krinkle> ah, not ia64?
[20:15:40] <gnarf> nope
[20:15:44] <gnarf> uname -a
[20:16:09] <gnarf> so like the url structure is pretty easy to hit ftp.us.debian.org by hand
[20:16:13] <Krinkle> right
[20:16:17] <gnarf> aptitude                            0.6.3-3.2+squeeze1
[20:16:25] <Krinkle> that one has many dependencies listed
[20:16:35] <gnarf> http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/aptitude/aptitude_0.6.3-3.2%2bsqueeze1_amd64.deb
[20:16:38] <gnarf> yup
[20:16:41] <gnarf> the joy
[20:16:42] <Krinkle> do I just need the top one (aptitude itself) 
[20:16:45] <Krinkle> since dpkg only listed that one
[20:16:55] <gnarf> dpkg -i will tell you if you need another
[20:16:59] <Krinkle> ok
[20:17:00] <gnarf> once you can get apt going
[20:17:07] <gnarf> you can prolly just aptitude install apt
[20:17:11] <gnarf> and get back to where we were
[20:17:12] <gnarf> :)
[20:17:29] <Krinkle> I mean the dependencies listed on http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/aptitude
[20:17:37] <Krinkle> If it needs those itself..
[20:17:40] <Krinkle> We'll ee
[20:17:48] <gnarf> a bunch of those might already be installed still
[20:17:52] <gnarf> so just try the top one
[20:18:14] <gnarf> and resolve the missing ones by hand
[20:18:36] <gnarf> dpkg -i will complain if it's missing a dep
[20:18:39] <Krinkle> yeah, it is erroring
[20:18:53] <Krinkle> $ sudo dpkg -i aptitude_0.6.3-3.2+squeeze1_amd64.deb  
[20:19:03] <Krinkle> Package libapt-pkg4.10 is not installed.
[20:19:03] <Krinkle>   Package apt which provides libapt-pkg4.10 is not installed.
[20:19:04] <Krinkle> etc.
[20:19:41] <gnarf> so you also need http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/apt/apt_0.8.10.3%2bsqueeze1_amd64.deb
[20:19:52] <gnarf> dpkg -l apt / find the package / install it
[20:19:55] <gnarf> until you get em back
[20:19:59] <Krinkle> yep
[20:20:08] <gnarf> and remember to never apt-get remove apt ever again because its a pain in the ass ;)
[20:20:48] <Krinkle> $ sudo dpkg -i apt_0.8.10.3+squeeze1_amd64.deb 
[20:20:51] <Krinkle> that one went without errors
[20:20:58] <Krinkle> but 'which apt' is still gone
[20:21:28] <gnarf> apt-get etc are aliasies to "aptitude"
[20:21:32] <gnarf> "apt" is just a shared lib
[20:21:48] <gnarf> you'll need to get "aptitude" installed
[20:22:27] <gnarf> you'll prolly need http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/apt/apt-utils_0.8.10.3%2bsqueeze1_amd64.deb too
[20:22:31] <Krinkle> nope
[20:22:45] <Krinkle> the only one I needed was apt-get -f install
[20:22:46] <Krinkle> apparently
[20:22:54] <Krinkle> the only one I needed was http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/apt
[20:23:06] <Krinkle> "which apt" never exists 
[20:23:10] <Krinkle> it did bring apt-get back
[20:23:22] <Krinkle> and recommended to run "apt-get -f install" to complete its dependencies
[20:23:26] <gnarf> cool
[20:23:43] <gnarf> i added a few packages back from dpkg -l | grep "^rc"
[20:24:04] <Krinkle> ok
[20:24:14] <Krinkle> that was fun, lets try again :P
[20:24:38] <Krinkle> anyway, thanks. It is nice to learn a bit how dpkg works, albeit the hard way
[20:27:58] <Krinkle> clarkbox: not sure if you're still here, if you are: Where is field "action" defined in splunk? I can't find type "cli-5" anywhere either (grepped entire opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps )
[20:28:10] <Krinkle> field "action" for testswarm-browserstack/cli.log
[20:46:02] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: apt-get is an alias to aptitude? 
[20:46:22] <gnarf> it all uses the same shit in the backend
[20:46:30] <ryanneufeld> it's all dpkg
[20:46:58] <ryanneufeld> but aptitude and apt are pretty different front ends
[21:25:42] <Krinkle> k, done for today: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/browserstack
[21:26:17] <Krinkle> everything in order, except for the error log, it only displays the first word
[21:26:31] <Krinkle> will need to hack in the regex for that manually, the auto detect doesn't take it
[21:43:19] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: you're right - apt is the core 
[21:43:28] * gnarf shrugs
[21:43:28] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[21:43:33] <gnarf> `unflip
[21:43:33] <b-ot> gnarf, â”¬â”€â”€â”¬ ï»¿ãƒŽ( ã‚œ-ã‚œãƒŽ)
[21:43:38] <gnarf> gg Krinkle|detached!
[21:43:41] <gnarf> :)
[22:31:06] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I'm right from time to time
