[07:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs: Architectural design question.
[07:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> We need to make plugin names case insensitive everywhere for the plugins site.
[07:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> Do we change the code to always lowercase names.
[07:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> Or do we make the database table itself case insensitive?
[08:21:26] <danheberden> The seems to rest on if we want to preserve showing it with whatever case they chose as a title
[08:21:34] <danheberden> which seems to only ever cause problems
[08:21:48] <danheberden> so in the db table, that would be a global force that would be consistent
[08:22:36] <danheberden> though i would probably change it to lowercase in the code as well just to be consistent and avoid confusion of "how is case not being preserved?!" 2 years from now 
[08:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so lowercase in case + case insensitive in db.
[08:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> s/in case/in code/
[08:25:27] <danheberden> that's what i'd do
[08:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[08:51:56] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I'm always a fan of all lowercase, reduces chances for collisions.
[09:18:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'd store the name of the plugin in the db in lower case, but make sure the url slug is still cased however they name it in the json
[09:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think that would mean they can change the casing on every release.
[09:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> Which I believe is what's happening righ tnow.
[10:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there going to be an infrastructure meeting today? If not, I'm going to run an errand.
[10:24:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lets go with no
[10:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll stick around for this discussion in -content, unless my response was all you needed from me.
[11:02:48] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: I second dan's suggestion, thanks!
[13:52:23] <jdorfman> hey can someone please create a record for codeorigin.jquery.com?
[13:52:57] <jdorfman> We want to run some initial test
[14:01:10] <s5fs> jdorfman: what kind of record, dns?
[14:19:32] <gnarf> jdorfman: s5fs: done
[14:19:47] <gnarf> jdorfman: might take a bit to prop
[14:33:35] <jdorfman> thanks, got the pull zone all set up
[14:34:06] <jdorfman> gnarf: what email do you want to use for the maxcdn account?
[14:34:10] <jdorfman> so I can add you
[14:35:35] <gnarf> jdorfman: gnarf37@gmail
[14:36:09] <jdorfman> word
[14:41:43] <jdorfman> s5fs: sorry didn't see your message
[14:41:51] <jdorfman> the A record is perfect ;)
[14:43:45] <s5fs> jdorfman: no worries, i didn't have access until moments ago, glad it's settled :)
[14:46:04] <jdorfman> woot
