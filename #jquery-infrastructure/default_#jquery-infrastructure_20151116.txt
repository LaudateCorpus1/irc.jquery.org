[16:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> When you get a chance, can you look at the deployment for stage.api.jqueryui.com/1.12/ ?
[16:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer set up the stuff in the infrastructure repo and I set up the stuff in jquery-wp-content.
[16:31:41] <scott_gonzalez> We got emails for the deployments, but the content isn't there.
