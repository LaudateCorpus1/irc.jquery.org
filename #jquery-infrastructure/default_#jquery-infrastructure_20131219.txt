[11:39:32] <gseguin> gnarf: the download builder for jqm is broken for 1.4.0
[11:39:50] <gseguin> I'm suspecting the version did not get checked out
[11:40:28] <gseguin> gnarf: shouldn't checkout on tagging semver?
[12:42:28] <gnarf> gseguin: which repo is it?
[12:42:53] <gseguin> jquery-mobile
[12:43:34] <gseguin> there is a webhook to http://jq02.jquery.com:3100/post_receive
[12:43:56] <gseguin> but I had to fetch the tags manually for the builder to work
[12:44:10] <gseguin> it could be a bug in the builder
[12:44:26] <gseguin> but I was under the impression that it worked for 1.4.0-rc.1
