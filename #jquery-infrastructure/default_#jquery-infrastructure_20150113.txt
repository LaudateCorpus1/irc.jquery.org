[05:06:56] <rxaviers> gnarf, Hello Corey
[05:07:07] <rxaviers> I'm moving Globalize discussions on IRC to its own #globalize channel
[05:07:12] <rxaviers>  Although, it's already registered to freenode-staff.
[05:07:23] <rxaviers> Do you know how I should proceed in order to claim its rights? I mean register it to ourselves?
[06:14:57] <rxaviers> gnarf, problem solved
[06:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs gnarf ryanneufeld: Can one of you get IRC logging set up? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/308
[06:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> We've got three new channels to log.

[09:37:57] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I'd love to, but I'm not sure which service logs those
[09:40:00] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: is jqlog still used for this?

[10:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Thanks.
[10:22:01] <ryanneufeld> np
[10:23:58] <ryanneufeld> I don't see it showing up on irc.jquery.com yet
[10:24:04] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure how that all works right now
[10:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> There's definitely a bit of a delay, so we'll see if anything shows up soon.
[10:30:20] <ryanneufeld> ok
