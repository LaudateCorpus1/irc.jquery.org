[08:23:14] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: generally uncheck "Keep Buffer" should give you what you need
[08:23:27] <jzaefferer> that way you get a replay just once
[08:28:02] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: Thanks, I got it sorted last night with gnarf's assitance. It's doing what I need now :)
[08:32:40] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: aye, okay
[13:59:25] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I don't think we retained anyone from the summit... :(
[13:59:30] <ryanneufeld> so far
[13:59:41] <gnarf> meaning?
[13:59:43] <ryanneufeld> many of the other channels seem to have kept theirs
[13:59:56] <ryanneufeld> meaning I'm being pessimistic I think
[14:00:06] <gnarf> I told them that we would be busy this week prolly, and I'd hope to see them around the next week
[14:00:15] <gnarf> I still think bosco is comin back for more on trac
[14:00:33] <ryanneufeld> oh right
