[00:13:34] <clarkbox> having trouble getting citadel up. using the new box
[00:13:53] <clarkbox> gnarl you having any issues?
[00:14:02] <clarkbox> gnarf
[00:17:48] <gnarf> clarkbox: i wouldn't be surprised if there are issues, i'll try that one tomorrow
[00:17:58] <clarkbox> ok, np
[00:18:19] <clarkbox> just a sneak peek then....
[00:18:21] <clarkbox> Error: Puppet::Parser::AST::Resource failed with error ArgumentError: Could not find declared class splunk at /tmp/vagrant-puppet/manifests/nodes/default.pp:29 on node citadel.jquery.com
[00:19:01] <clarkbox> doh.. never mind thats me
[00:19:01] <clarkbox> ha
[00:19:08] <clarkbox> k I'm too tired. good night!
[00:19:47] <clarkbox> i thought you reverted that commit...
[04:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That's the permission problem. What user are you running as?
[08:54:36] <ryanneuf_> clarkbox: did that image work okay for you?
[10:35:24] <ryanneufeld_> gnarf: did that new box workout for you?
[10:35:39] <gnarf> ryanneufeld_: i never tried the newest
[10:35:45] <ryanneufeld_> ah
[10:35:58] <gnarf> but the first one worked fine for jq02
[10:36:02] <gnarf> so if you installed pwgen
[10:36:05] <gnarf> im sure its good
[10:36:07] <gnarf> dbl checkin now
[10:36:09] <ryanneufeld_> I did
[10:36:17] <ryanneufeld_> and I upgraded the OS as well
[10:37:26] <gnarf> downloading box now
[10:58:52] <gnarf> ryanneufeld_: you sure the new box got uploaded
[10:58:56] <gnarf> im getting a missing pwgen error
[10:59:06] <ryanneufeld_> yes, I'm sure
[10:59:12] <ryanneufeld_> it has the same name
[10:59:16] <gnarf> well there is a "conflicted" upload
[10:59:18] <gnarf> with a different name
[10:59:20] <ryanneufeld_> oic
[10:59:23] <gnarf> which i think might be the right box?
[10:59:34] <gnarf> i think i just downloaded the old box again
[11:00:40] <clarkbox> can we use more descriptive names than squeeze64?
[11:01:53] <ryanneufeld_> What would you lke?
[11:02:09] <ryanneufeld_> squeeze64 is a Debian squeeze 64 bit
[11:02:49] <ryanneufeld_> gnarf, if you can delete that box
[11:02:51] <ryanneufeld_> and try again
[11:02:54] <ryanneufeld_> it should be okay now
[11:02:55] <gnarf> already did :)
[11:02:58] <ryanneufeld_> ah
[11:02:59] <ryanneufeld_> l
[11:03:00] <ryanneufeld_> *k
[11:03:03] <clarkbox> just a version number ore something
[11:03:10] <gnarf> squeeze is a version number
[11:03:11] <gnarf> :)
[11:03:15] <ryanneufeld_> ^^
[11:03:17] <clarkbox> i mean our version
[11:03:18] <clarkbox> ha
[11:03:26] <gnarf> oh like - box version 1
[11:03:31] <clarkbox> like this is 2.0? or .2
[11:03:35] <ryanneufeld_> I'm gonna vote no
[11:03:43] <clarkbox> ya box version
[11:03:49] <clarkbox> how do you know what box you have?
[11:03:51] <clarkbox> is there a guid?
[11:04:15] <ryanneufeld_> fair point
[11:06:14] <ryanneufeld_> clarkbox: can you propose something?
[11:06:57] <gnarf> well if it was just updated via the url
[11:07:02] <gnarf>  /name of the box
[11:07:08] <gnarf> makes some sense
[11:07:11] <clarkbox> gnarf loves automation
[11:07:15] <gnarf> .1 the next one?
[11:07:34] <ryanneufeld_> what would it look like?
[11:07:40] <ryanneufeld_> example?
[11:08:05] <gnarf> like https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qxr8hhdqzhy5167/jqSqueeze.1.box
[11:13:24] <ajpiano> clarkbox: you around in about 30mins to collude with gnarf and danheberden and me for a few mins
[11:14:11] <clarkbox> ya
[11:15:09] <ajpiano> great i'll ping you
[11:18:07] <ryanneufeld_> gnarf: I'm not opposed to that, though now that we have a base box, are we going to have a .1?
[11:18:37] <gnarf> ryanneufeld_: hopefully not
[11:18:48] <gnarf> ryanneufeld_: but i imagine at some point it might be nice to update something in the base box
[11:19:10] <ryanneufeld_> gnarf: puppet should be able to handle that for us, though if puppet is the issue....
[11:19:12] <ryanneufeld_> :P
[11:19:27] <ryanneufeld_> I'll agree for lack of a better idea
[11:20:14] <clarkbox> gnarl, any pointers on that splunk module?
[11:20:30] <clarkbox> bah, muscle memory knows you as gnarl
[11:20:33] <clarkbox> *gnarf
[11:21:01] <clarkbox> keep in mind i don't know ruby at all
[11:21:10] <clarkbox> so if my syntax is off…
[11:21:53] <clarkbox> and can you point me to an example of puppet inheritance?
[11:22:30] <gnarf> clarkbox: I was just gonna feed you back an example using your own stuff
[11:22:37] <clarkbox> cool
[11:22:40] <gnarf> clarkbox: I'll tweak on it in a minute
[11:22:47] <gnarf> just got done with one meeting
[11:22:50] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld_: are you ryan.neufeld on skype
[11:22:59] <ryanneufeld_> ajpiano: yes, I am
[11:23:26] <clarkbox> hey ajpiano, i don't have Skype-ability right now
[11:23:40] <ajpiano> when will you be able to?
[11:23:53] <ryanneufeld_> ajpiano: do I need to be on a skype call?
[11:24:10] <clarkbox> i can do a phone call.
[11:24:19] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld_: you're invited if you want to, we're just gonna talk for a few mins about like, infra goals and data splunk goals for the summit
[11:24:28] <ryanneufeld_> when are you gonna do thise?
[11:24:31] <gnarf> clarkbox: if you give me your number, I have skype credits, i can prolly dial you in
[11:25:43] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld_: hopefully in the next few mins
[11:25:48] <ryanneufeld_> oic
[11:26:00] <ryanneufeld_> lemme check w/ da boss make sure I can join
[11:26:41] <ryanneufeld_> ajpiano: yeah, i can join in
[11:27:31] <ajpiano> clarkbox set up a webex we're gonna do that
[11:27:33] <ajpiano> just call in
[11:28:28] <ryanneufeld_> oic

[12:08:23] <ryanneufeld__> yeah, something like that
[12:08:36] <ryanneufeld__> if puppet supports doing that, then that would be the ticket
[12:08:43] <gnarf> pretty sure thats exactly it
[12:08:50] <gnarf> not 100% sure with puppet apply

[12:44:07] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-splunk] Merge branch 'puppet-stage' into puppet-splunk - Corey Frang
[12:44:38] <gnarf> wanted all the work we did on vagrant yesterday ^^^ :)
[12:48:53] <gnarf> clarkbox: testing an idea here in a second
[12:48:59] <gnarf> clarkbox: then ill push it up if it works :)
[13:18:47] <gnarf> clarkbox: /Stage[main]/Splunk::Forwarder/Exec[/opt/splunk/bin/splunk set deploy-poll citadel.jquery.com:8089]/returns: Authentication needed, run "splunk login"
[13:20:59] <clarkbox> back
[13:21:23] <clarkbox> let me figure out a way around that gnarf
[13:25:19] <clarkbox> set deploy-poll mymachine.example.com:8089 -auth admin:changeme
[13:25:24] <clarkbox> change exec to that
[13:25:31] <jqcommit> [infrastructure] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to puppet-splunk: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/2b69161f2f0b875242496fad2664b1f4d1db3b42
[13:25:31] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-splunk] Refactoring splunk modules a bit - citadel to test indexer, jq05.stage to test forwarder - Corey Frang
[13:25:47] <gnarf> clarkbox: check that out, I'm using the little arrow syntax to describe the order things must be done
[13:25:50] <clarkbox> here is a relevant link gnarf http://splunk-base.splunk.com/answers/43758/scripted-splunkforwarder-deployment-failed-error-updating-configuration
[13:26:21] <clarkbox> cool
[13:26:23] <gnarf> so admin:changeme is the default password? :)
[13:26:29] <clarkbox> yes :|
[13:26:33] <gnarf> thats cool
[13:27:30] <clarkbox> thanks for this. it helps me learn a lot
[13:28:02] <gnarf> clarkbox: trying to stand up citadel in vagrant atm
[13:28:08] <gnarf> see if the indexer is working
[13:28:18] <gnarf> but the forwarder was installing save for the issue setting the data
[13:28:32] <clarkbox> i think we could emit the unless condition in the "#start spliunk for first time" exec
[13:28:49] <clarkbox> cool, ill stand up
[13:28:56] <clarkbox> i need to grab the new box
[13:29:22] <gnarf> hrm
[13:29:30] <gnarf> does the indexer install at /opt/splunk ?
[13:29:35] <clarkbox> yes
[13:29:39] <gnarf> and the forwarder at /opt/splunkforwarder
[13:29:39] <gnarf> ?
[13:29:44] <clarkbox> i don't think so
[13:29:49] <clarkbox> i think both are the same
[13:29:52] <clarkbox> not 100% sure
[13:29:56] <gnarf> the forwarder def installs there
[13:30:05] <clarkbox> let me check
[13:30:08] <clarkbox> oh ok
[13:30:42] <gnarf> i linked it to /opt/splunk tho
[13:30:46] <gnarf> that gonna work?
[13:30:54] <clarkbox> i am not sure
[13:30:58] <clarkbox> it could work
[13:31:47] <clarkbox> in consideration of the future, we may not want to do that
[13:32:03] <clarkbox> you could have an indexer and forwarder on the same machine
[13:32:14] <clarkbox> let me check to see if that scenario makes sense
[13:32:45] <clarkbox> no, wait… you only need one splunk process to take care of both. so there should only ever be ONE "splunk" per machine
[13:33:33] <clarkbox> i just build this shit… i don't deploy it ;)
[13:53:35] <gnarf> clarkbox: when do these authToken's expire?
[13:53:36] <clarkbox> gnarf: ERROR - /Applications/Vagrant/embedded/lib/ruby/1.9.1/psych.rb:229:in `initialize': No such file or directory - vagrant/config.yml (Errno::ENOENT)
[13:53:59] <clarkbox> um. they do.
[13:54:14] <clarkbox> why are you using them?
[13:54:28] <clarkbox> you can config TTL
[13:54:50] <gnarf> clarkbox: well, I'm trying to figure out how to know if i already set the password
[13:56:15] <clarkbox> cat etc/passwd
[13:56:37] <gnarf> oh
[13:56:42] <clarkbox> you could tell if you change the admin email when you change PW
[13:56:43] <gnarf> i could change the name to jQuery
[13:56:45] <gnarf> or something
[13:56:56] <clarkbox> otherwise, the password hash is prob the same - though it may be salted/generated on install
[13:57:00] <clarkbox> ya
[13:58:30] <gnarf> where is the help for this command line?
[13:58:39] <clarkbox> there are some good docs
[13:58:57] <clarkbox> http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/CLIadmincommands
[13:59:41] <gnarf> no help
[13:59:56] <gnarf> i wanna figure out what i need to add for -name or whatever
[14:00:03] <clarkbox> like --help?
[14:00:11] <clarkbox> http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/4.3.4/Admin/GethelpwiththeCLI
[14:00:41] <clarkbox> can you be more specific?
[14:00:52] <clarkbox> to change user name?
[14:02:10] <gnarf> yeah
[14:02:16] <gnarf> its -email for email tho
[14:02:19] <gnarf> thats good enough
[14:02:29] <clarkbox> you can just sed the passwd file
[14:03:14] <gnarf> i was hoping for something I could do from the cli on that set password line
[14:03:23] <gnarf> but it doesn't matter much, found a workaround
[14:03:28] <clarkbox> ya, it MAY not be possible
[14:03:37] <clarkbox> things are usually well documented
[14:07:10] <clarkbox> ok found it - $splunk edit user admin -full-name test
[14:09:38] <gnarf> Error: /Stage[main]/Splunk::Forwarder/Splunk::Command[set deploy-poll citadel.jquery.com:8089]/Exec[splunk set deploy-poll citadel.jquery.com:8089]/returns: change from notrun to 0 failed: /opt/splunk/bin/splunk set deploy-poll citadel.jquery.com:8089 -auth 'admin:...' returned 4 instead of one of [0]
[14:09:47] <gnarf> do you know what an exit code of 4 means?
[14:10:46] <clarkbox> nooo....
[14:11:08] <gnarf> it seemed to do what it was supposed to, but wondering why it returned "4" not "0"
[14:12:00] <clarkbox> how can you tell what the status code is from CLI?
[14:15:19] <clarkbox> got it… echo $?
[14:15:22] <clarkbox> after the command
[14:15:26] <clarkbox> and i am getting a 0
[14:15:31] <clarkbox> when i run it by hand
[14:17:19] <gnarf> yeah
[14:17:22] <gnarf> dunno what was messy
[14:17:27] <gnarf> jq05 seems to stand up now
[14:17:30] <gnarf> i changed some more things
[14:17:38] <clarkbox> also, make sure that command is run before starting splunk
[14:17:42] <clarkbox> otherwise you'll need to restart

[14:33:48] <clarkbox> ganrf, ryanneufeld
[14:36:02] <gnarf> clarkbox: have you git submodule update --init ?
[14:36:12] <clarkbox> nope!
[14:36:27] <clarkbox> now i understand submodules!
[14:37:11] <clarkbox> k i gotta run to my sons hockey practice
[14:37:16] <clarkbox> is there anything you need from me?
[14:37:26] <gnarf> nope
[14:37:37] <clarkbox> you can get in touch on gtalk - i will respond if i can
[14:37:43] <clarkbox> thanks for all your help
[14:37:47] <gnarf> we should figure out how to undo the splunks that got installed on the stage servers
[14:38:01] <clarkbox> should be simple...
[14:38:20] <clarkbox> we can a) rm -f the directory
[14:38:37] <gnarf> gotta dpkg remove it if it was installed
[14:38:42] <clarkbox> or the dpkg may install over top
[14:38:44] <clarkbox> ya ok
[14:38:55] <gnarf> i updated the dpkg check to also do | grep ^i | to only filter the "installed package"
[14:39:15] <clarkbox> thats an important detail
[14:40:01] <jqcommit> [infrastructure] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to puppet-splunk: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/76ca89d2b959abc41214ed4ec8ab53a566f4eb82
[14:40:01] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-splunk] grep ^i on the dpkg for this package too - Corey Frang
[14:40:20] <clarkbox> k I'm out. will be back in 4-5 hours
[19:25:03] <clarkbox> back! whats up gnarf? need help with anything?
[19:38:04] <gnarf> clarkbox: nah - i think that stands up on jq05.stage now and citadel
[19:38:32] <clarkbox> ya i just upped citadel
[19:38:57] <clarkbox> so whats next step?
[19:39:07] <clarkbox> when do you want to push it live?
[19:39:10] <gnarf> do we have other "config" steps we should take here?
[19:39:19] <gnarf> or is the rest in the web interface?
[19:39:54] <clarkbox> we can do the rest in the web interface. if i discover something that can be automated, ill add it to puppet as i go
[19:40:13] <clarkbox> hmm, splunk is not on the citadel i just booted up
[19:40:18] <clarkbox> did you add it to the node?
[19:40:23] <gnarf> yes?
[19:40:46] <gnarf> yer on puppet-splunk with latest ^^^ ?
[19:40:56] <gnarf> 76ca89d
[19:41:14] <gnarf> for now i just hacked it in in site.pp
[19:41:30] <gnarf> include splunk::indexer -- line 17
[19:42:32] <clarkbox> you're saying i need to add that?
[19:42:40] <clarkbox> or it should be there?
[19:42:47] <gnarf> it should be there if you're on latest
[19:43:00] <gnarf> manifests/site.pp
[19:43:01] <clarkbox> ah i have it
[19:43:04] <clarkbox> sorry
[19:50:33] <clarkbox> k looking good
[19:51:48] <clarkbox> you could open up the module if you wanted too. all other puppet splunk modules are super complex. this is a nice bare-bones clean option
[19:55:20] <gnarf> possible
[19:55:27] <gnarf> lets see if we encounter any growing pains with it
[19:57:24] <clarkbox> yup
[19:58:16] <clarkbox> so what server has the most usage? what one is most resource constrained?
[19:58:48] <clarkbox> i want to test out the performance limit. make sure it can handle the load the forwarder places on it if we index most everything
[20:03:34] <clarkbox> in terms of doing further puppetization… its probably easiest to get things running via the GUI. once things are running just right, we can copy a few key conf files and have puppet deploy those in the future
