[04:17:27] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15mgol closed issue #333: Exception when trying to create a new Jenkins project 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/333
[04:18:52] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15mgol opened issue #384: Jenkins run out of space 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/384
[04:36:52] <m_gol> Should we have IRC notification hooks for the infra repo which is supposed to be private? This sounds... unwise.
[05:49:00] <m_gol> I trimmed jenkins.log, it took 174 GB of space O_o
[12:22:33] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: I don't have admin on jenkins
[12:22:51] <ryanneufeld> but if you do, you should be able to clear out some project workspaces.
[12:28:51] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: yeah, I've resolved it for now
[12:29:05] <ryanneufeld> What did you do?
[12:29:08] <m_gol> the jenkins.log file took 174 GB :D
[12:29:17] <m_gol> I trimmed it to the last 500 lines
[12:29:29] <ryanneufeld> whoa
[12:29:32] <ryanneufeld> that's a bit large
[12:29:36] <m_gol> shouldn't it rotate?
[12:29:41] <ryanneufeld> it should, yes
[12:31:02] <m_gol> gotta go; I'll need to investigate further so that it doesn't happen again
