[11:21:39] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: In sites.php, if we have a site that is now dead, can we just delete it from the array?
[12:50:09] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: does it matter if it stays? I'm not sure what'll happen for blog IDs.
[12:50:17] <nacin> consider it a placeholder for future use.
[12:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll just leave it.

[18:23:59] <gseguin> awesome, thanks gnarf!
[18:24:29] <gseguin> so master is staging and any semver tag is live, is that rignt?
[18:25:18] <gnarf> gseguin yup
[18:26:34] <gseguin> gnarf: not sure we needed staging but that's cool
[18:27:31] <gseguin> gnarf: is there a way to do like the codeorigin repo?
[18:28:55] <gseguin> and by the way it's working gnarf, staging and live
[18:31:15] <gseguin> the issue I have I see with staging is that this is going to be part of a release script so anything that gets pushed should be publish to prod
[18:31:22] <gseguin> unless...
[18:31:41] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: do you want to use staging for the test mode ?
[18:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> not really
[18:33:07] <gseguin> yeah I guess for testing we can just not update the index.php
[18:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> You can make the test mode copy the files and do the commit, just don't push or tag.
[18:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> Then you can test locally if you want.
[18:34:13] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: so you're saying staging is useful or not?
[18:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> There is never a reason not to have a staging server.
[18:34:35] <gseguin> I would think this repo should work like codeorigin
[18:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> But you shouldn't be deploying to stage during release script tests.
[18:35:03] <gnarf> if there are some reasons to make live deploy from master, its easy enough
[18:35:10] <gseguin> oh so the tagging should be manual?
[18:36:17] <gseguin> gnarf: I'm not sure, I'm just thinking if every time the script pushes to the repo it also tags, then it's kinda pointless
[18:37:11] <gnarf> generally we push to stage, test, then tag and push the tag 
[18:37:30] <gnarf> if this is automated, i don't see a reason not to just commit tag / push
[18:37:34] <gseguin> so that means the tagging step would be a manual step
[18:37:51] <gnarf> but generally - we test on stage before deploying to live
[18:38:17] <gnarf> this also gives you the ability to edit something in themeroller without deploying it to live immediately
[18:38:31] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ^
[18:38:31] <gnarf> and well, i'd rather have the consistency of deploy on tag
[18:39:25] <gseguin> I'm cool with either
[18:39:48] <gseguin> thanks a lot, I'll write the script accordingly
[18:40:01] <gseguin> oh, last thing gnarf
[18:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> I prefer consistency as well.
[18:40:44] <gseguin> could you redirect/proxy jquerymobile.com/demos to demos.jquerymobile.com ?
[18:43:01] <gnarf> um, which? redirect or proxy?
[18:43:19] <gseguin> proxy I guess
[18:43:42] <gnarf> what is the desired result here?
[18:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> Not proxy.
[18:44:02] <gseguin> that the current links from the blog posts to the demos still work
[18:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> You want a permanent redirect.
[18:44:57] <gseguin> so in the old blog posts we have links to say: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0
[18:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, links that we control should get updated.
[18:45:35] <gseguin> but what about the ones we don't control?
[18:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> They'll get the redirect.
[18:46:33] <gseguin> won't the redirect be only for http://jquerymobile/demos -> http://demos.jquerymobile.com ?
[18:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> no
[18:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be jquerymobile.com/demos/* -> demos.jquerymobile.com/*
[18:47:09] <gseguin> oh ok

[18:47:10] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 142d11e95 15Corey Frang: redirect for demos and themeroller to new sites
[18:47:20] <gseguin> just curious, what's wrong with proxying?
[18:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's not what you want.
[18:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> The correct URL is demos.jquerymobile.com and you want the world to know that.
[18:48:17] <gseguin> ok
[18:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> Proxying would keep the URL as jquerymobile.com/demos/*
[18:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> And then you'll have two URLs with the same content, and no canonical URL listed.
[18:49:01] <gseguin> ok
[18:49:15] <gseguin> kid duty, be back later
[18:49:26] <s5fs> gseguin: i'd proxy the kid request
[18:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
