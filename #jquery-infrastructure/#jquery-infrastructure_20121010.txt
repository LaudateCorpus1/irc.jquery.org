[00:54:17] <gnarf> might of been because /etc/init.d/splunk already existed?

[01:07:27] <clarkbox> id rather be writing scripts by hand ;_
[01:53:43] <gnarf> you can deploy and exec scripts too
[10:50:00] <clarkbox> nah I'm good. i just need to learn ruby, and puppet convention.
[10:50:14] <clarkbox> that timeout does not seem to work
[10:50:25] <clarkbox> ill email you a log
[10:50:42] <clarkbox> i can replicate in vagrant
[10:50:57] <clarkbox> gnarf ^
[11:23:09] <gnarf> clarkbox: its dumping out usage
[11:23:13] <gnarf> seems like thats the problem there
[11:23:37] <clarkbox> what if we >> file.log
[11:24:04] <gnarf> clarkbox: if its printing usage, it means something is wrong right?
[11:24:21] <clarkbox> no, its informing user about startup process
[11:24:45] <gnarf> and its exit(2) ?
[11:24:51] <gnarf> thats an error
[11:26:35] <clarkbox> let me see what i get IRL!
[11:28:41] <clarkbox> is it normal that the command is repeated?
[11:28:47] <clarkbox> also, we don't need auth for all commands
[11:30:28] <gnarf> clarkbox: is that breaking it?
[11:30:42] <clarkbox> might be
[11:30:59] <gnarf> the command is repeated?
[11:31:04] <clarkbox> but it works in vagrant 100%
[11:31:05] <clarkbox> so...
[11:31:50] <gnarf> clarkbox: sounds to me like some portion of splunk stuck around after you removed it
[11:31:55] <gnarf> like the /etc/init.d or something
[11:32:07] <clarkbox> no i got it all out
[11:32:19] <clarkbox> i did a find / -name *splunk*
[11:32:21] <gnarf> and because that "portion" was there, it doesn't execute something it should
[11:33:04] <gnarf> if its not that, then what is different between the two?
[11:33:05] <clarkbox> ill figure it out
[11:33:18] <clarkbox> i have some time to work on it now...
[11:33:28] <clarkbox> like… right now!
[11:37:03] <gnarf> clarkbox: it seems to have gotten past the "start" issue
[11:37:10] <gnarf> now its not able to edit the password
[11:38:37] <clarkbox> hmm
[11:38:42] <clarkbox> maybe the timeout did work
[11:39:04] <clarkbox> are you testing or in live env?
[11:39:08] <clarkbox> what server?
[11:39:46] <clarkbox> i just started splunk on jq01 by hand… that could have been it
[11:40:50] <clarkbox> i just shut it down now
[11:41:03] <gnarf> i was on citadel
[11:41:05] <gnarf> sorry
[11:41:10] <clarkbox> i also started on citadel...
[11:42:17] <clarkbox> ill shut it down there too
[11:43:51] <clarkbox> can you make the auth command optional
[11:44:06] <clarkbox> i am not sure how to go about that in ruby
[11:44:53] <clarkbox> a node js deployment framework would be nice :) for me at least.
[12:03:42] <clarkbox> hey gnarf, help me with this ruby...
[12:03:54] <clarkbox> how can i pass in a bool to the command
[12:03:56] <gnarf> lord, if you need ruby help
[12:04:10] <gnarf> clarkbox: i did that with password => false
[12:04:17] <clarkbox> and then based on that remove the $real_auth
[12:04:31] <clarkbox> ah i see
[12:04:34] <gnarf> doesn't $real_auth = $password ? { false => "", ....
[12:04:50] <clarkbox> now that you point that out i can see it being done… but wow. what a syntax
[12:05:06] <gnarf> value ? { map }
[12:05:07] <clarkbox> there is a reason i have avoided ruby till now
[12:05:17] <clarkbox> yes its got false => ""
[12:05:24] <gnarf> clarkbox: i don't think thats a ruby, but it could be
[12:05:27] <gnarf> i dunno ruby
[12:05:44] <clarkbox> ya i don't even know where i am lacking… ruby or puppet
[12:05:45] <gnarf> i had to like crawl around on my knees begging people in 3 IRC channels for help fixing a puppet 3.0 issue :)
[12:05:51] <clarkbox> haha
[12:05:54] <clarkbox> and here i am
[12:06:27] <clarkbox> k i am making progress...
[12:06:35] <clarkbox> slwoly
[12:11:29] <gnarf> danheberden: yt?
[12:12:18] <gnarf> and/or DaveMethvin ajpiano - i need a proof/opinions on a email to the dev summit infra table http://oksoclap.com/infraintro
[12:12:34] <DaveMethvin> looking
[12:25:24] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/47 added this
[12:25:32] <gnarf> thats a good non-puppet one i think
[12:25:44] <gnarf> someone could solo that probably
[12:25:45] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[12:30:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do you know where I can get a list of my table's emails?
[12:30:45] <DaveMethvin> i was just about to ping ajpiano for the same
[12:31:13] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if he's still on vacay
[12:32:08] <DaveMethvin> also i need to tap his expertise on the NYP-->BOS train
[12:32:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i think he's still afk vaca
[12:32:54] <DaveMethvin> THE NERVE!
[12:33:06] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I was hoping you might have access to the spreadsheet?
[12:33:09] <gnarf> danheberden: probably does
[12:33:13] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[12:33:20] <gnarf> hell
[12:33:22] <gnarf> maybe i do
[12:33:25] <gnarf> and i just don't know
[12:33:34] <gnarf> WTB "jQuery Foundation" folder in google drive btw
[12:33:48] <DaveMethvin> ah, jackpot
[12:33:54] <gnarf> perhaps with a "jQuery Public" folder inside of it
[12:34:11] <DaveMethvin> it's the jQDC2012(2) Planning sheet in Google Docs
[12:34:15] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: can you share me?
[12:34:20] <DaveMethvin> which email?
[12:34:25] <gnarf> gnarf37@gmail
[12:35:21] <DaveMethvin> should be there right soon
[12:37:48] <gnarf> woah crazy
[12:37:51] <gnarf> i got ben?
[12:39:58] <clarkbox> hey gnarf… the edit user command needs to access /root/.splunk - and it cant
[12:40:24] <clarkbox> do these commands run as root?
[12:40:29] <gnarf> it should be root
[12:41:18] <clarkbox> returns: Can't create directory "'/root'/.splunk": No such file or directory
[12:42:08] <clarkbox> sudo ls -la /root/ |grep splunk
[12:42:09] <clarkbox> drwx--x--x  2 root root     4096 Oct 10 21:29 .splunk
[12:42:27] <gnarf> clarkbox: ohh shit
[12:42:31] <gnarf> look at the ''
[12:42:40] <clarkbox> bah
[12:42:40] <gnarf> fix the environment
[12:42:43] <gnarf> HOME=/root
[12:42:45] <gnarf> should suffice
[12:56:35] <gnarf> I think I'm gonna make a "dev-summit-infra" team to give pull access to jquery/infrastructure, unless scott_gonzalez or DaveMethvin has an objection to this plan
[12:57:04] <DaveMethvin> sounds like an easy way to manage potentially temporary perms
[12:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: seems fine
[12:57:28] <gnarf> k

[13:13:45] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-stage] fix home param value. dont auth on start. - clark a
[13:24:10] <clarkbox> how should i clear out the old (failed) deb download? the forwarders downloaded the wrong arch, and now the download command does not seem to re-run/replace. should i just remove by hand and move on?
[13:24:27] <clarkbox> gnarf ^
[13:24:46] <gnarf> clarkbox: yeah
[13:24:49] <gnarf> rm it
[13:24:53] <gnarf> and puppet agent --test
[13:25:48] <Krinkle> gnarf: I've been watching a few splunk videos but it sounds all a bit blurry / commercial. What do we use it for actually?
[13:26:02] <clarkbox> haha
[13:26:10] <Krinkle> is it like nagios/ganglia?
[13:26:25] <Krinkle> it seems to do more than that, allowing arbitrary data analysis
[13:26:32] <clarkbox> its more about collecting data
[13:26:35] <gnarf> clarkbox should prolly answer that
[13:26:37] <clarkbox> in our case, machine data like logs
[13:26:38] <gnarf> :)
[13:27:05] <clarkbox> and then gives us a single point of access that will help us diagnose errors, and proactively identify problems
[13:27:30] <clarkbox> take a look at the unix app
[13:27:46] <clarkbox> download the product. install that app
[13:28:03] <clarkbox> that will get your mind thinking of practical applications
[13:29:19] <Krinkle> cool
[13:29:31] <Krinkle> so it is more generic than nagios/gangla, but given the right data, it can do the same + more.
[13:30:14] <clarkbox> yes
[13:30:24] <clarkbox> i am sure we will grow to use it on an almost daily basis
[13:30:39] <clarkbox> i do work for them… but i was a believer before i started drinking the cool-aid
[13:30:43] <clarkbox> ;)
[13:31:34] <clarkbox> for example, we could have identified the download builder problems before it went viral
[13:31:44] <clarkbox> on the ui site launch
[14:15:03] <ajpiano> gnarf: infra intro seems good to me
[14:15:16] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: ping me if you want me to take a look at something, i'm about to board my flight back home
[14:15:37] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: no i'm good, got the info i needed
[14:16:01] <ajpiano> great
[14:16:05] <ajpiano> including about amtrak?
[14:16:10] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[14:16:20] <DaveMethvin> so, train or plane from nyc to bos?
[14:16:38] <ajpiano> train 100% of the time every time
[14:16:43] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[14:16:50] <DaveMethvin> seems like the better way
[14:17:08] <ajpiano> i can't say enough about how much preferable it is
[14:17:23] <ryanneufeld> I wish I could take a train to the summit
[14:17:24] <ajpiano> especially as i've now been in the toronto airport for 2+ hours for a 1 hour flight
[14:17:34] <ryanneufeld> ew
[14:17:36] <DaveMethvin> it's a bit longer but considering the time savings in hassle on both ends it probably is about the same time
[14:17:51] <ajpiano> yeah, exactly
[14:17:53] <DaveMethvin> plus they have wifi and scenery and shit
[14:18:02] <DaveMethvin> and a club car
[14:18:11] <ryanneufeld> 'n shit DaveMethvin... scenery'n shit
[14:18:13] <ajpiano> getting to jfk, getting back from logan, security, free mediocre wifi, alcohol etc etc
[14:18:17] <ryanneufeld> so not street bra
[14:18:28] <DaveMethvin> hahha
[14:18:44] <ryanneufeld> who am I kidding
[14:18:52] <ryanneufeld> I'm so not street :P
[14:18:57] <DaveMethvin> ok you convinced me ajpiano
[14:20:34] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I was looking in the docs on Ui, but I can't seem to find a way to disable the ui features on one tab in the tabs widget. Is it possible w/o unbinding the click on that element?
[14:21:07] <ryanneufeld> someone was asking about it in #jquery last night, and I couldn't help but think it was doable with a data-attr or something
[14:22:00] <ajpiano> what is "the ui features"
[14:23:01] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld:
[14:23:35] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: oh, yeah that was pretty vague, my bad. The person wanted one tab to behave as a normal link, but still have the UI tabs css
[14:24:11] <ajpiano> oh man imagine if there was a way in html to apply CSS
[14:24:13] <ajpiano> to an element
[14:24:18] <ajpiano> that would be totally crazy
[14:24:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah, if only
[14:24:51] <ryanneufeld> I was tired, never suggested that
[14:24:54] <ajpiano> i imagine you could just shunt one in there with js
[14:25:01] <ajpiano> after tabs was inited
[14:25:09] <ajpiano> i donno how much tabs would like it if you had a tab with no fragment
[14:25:45] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I dunno, he found something on SO that just unbound the click handler on the desired tab
[14:25:53] <ryanneufeld> I thought it was a bit hacky
[14:26:29] <gnarf> you should be able to just stopProp on the click event on the link in 1.9
[14:26:44] <gnarf> cuz i think the tabs click is bound to the container, not the actual button
[14:27:02] <ryanneufeld> That could have worked too
[14:36:58] <gnarf> nice, figured out what the issue with the bandwidth graphs was
[14:37:04] <gnarf> they seem to be working again - YAY

[14:41:40] <jqcommit> [infrastructure/puppet-stage] fixing obvious mistakes - clark a
[14:42:30] <gnarf> hey clarkbox
[14:42:32] <gnarf> that last one
[14:42:42] <clarkbox> ya
[14:42:46] <gnarf> service { "splunk": ensure => running } should handle that
[14:42:48] <gnarf> right?
[14:43:10] <clarkbox> it should…
[14:43:21] <clarkbox> let me try taking out the start command
[14:43:30] <gnarf> it does /etc/init.d/splunk status and start/stop if its not running
[14:43:45] <clarkbox> ok cool. i was wondering about that
[14:44:06] <gnarf> might want to hasstatus => true
[14:44:10] <gnarf> on that service
[14:44:25] <clarkbox> k ill add that as well
[14:46:08] <gnarf> hrm
[14:46:10] <gnarf> seems thats default
[14:46:10] <gnarf> http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#service
[14:46:14] <gnarf> so thats cool
[14:46:26] <clarkbox> k
[14:47:41] <gnarf> clarkbox: do you know if the status exit code is non-zero if any of the services aren't running?
[14:47:49] <gnarf> i.e. i see that status is talking about 3 pids
[14:48:13] <gnarf> it dose
[14:48:15] <gnarf> does
[14:48:44] <gnarf> that service should basically do /etc/init.d/splunk status || /etc/init.d/splunk start
[14:52:41] <clarkbox> gnarf, did you say i SHOULD add a command to rm the deb file?
[14:52:52] <clarkbox> or did you mean to rm it by hand?
[14:53:27] <gnarf> rm it by hand
