[10:33:46] <danheberden> gnarf, what do you think about making static.jquery.com no longer a cdn?
[10:34:22] <danheberden> i feel the impact, when the site's aren't using the css/js/images off of it like crazy, would be substantial re: cdn cost
[10:34:56] <danheberden> (also, re: znc, there's the issue of us having access to logs, ya?)
[11:02:46] <danheberden> side note, gnarf, is gith at all something you still wanted to use?
[11:45:32] <gnarf> danheberden: I could look at gith, but the stuff scott_gonzalez did is working fine for notifier
[11:45:47] <danheberden> sweet
[11:46:00] <danheberden> as in if it ain't broke... :)
[11:56:01] <gnarf> danheberden: im not sure how much bandwidth we are using static
[11:56:24] <gnarf> with the proper cache headers now, maybe we don't need it?
[11:56:38] <danheberden> well i'd like to at least get the video's off if possible
[11:57:17] <gnarf> its hosting vids?
[11:57:18] <gnarf> crazy
[11:57:33] <gnarf> um
[11:57:43] <gnarf> I can go either way on that one
[11:57:55] <gnarf> I mean, any bandwidth we transfer off the CDN we will pick up on a host somewhere
[11:58:09] <gnarf> unless we do something drastic (like cache all the things)
[11:58:40] <danheberden> obviously, but hosting bandwidth through (mt), cost wise, will be substantially less than than via edgecast
[11:59:09] <danheberden> and the amount of traffic shouldn't be too severe, as it probably was ( and warranted a cdn ) before
[11:59:25] <danheberden> since they are just random vids that are probably hit via search results
[11:59:48] <danheberden> also hotlinked css/js 'n shit
[12:00:55] <gnarf> aye
[12:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> I would expect a lot of static. traffic to go away with the new sites.
[12:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> Though I don't have a good sense of what our traffic looks like for static.
[12:10:50] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: if you were asking about jQuery domains, i think most of ours are reg'd through "namecheap"
[12:11:12] <ryanneufeld> cross channel answers.. nice
[12:19:50] <ryanneufeld> this has been going around our office http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=vD1Usk0DYc0&NR=1
[12:32:31] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: ummm
[12:58:32] <gnarf> afk
