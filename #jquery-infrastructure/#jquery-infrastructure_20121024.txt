[09:25:52] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: is there a day of the week you'd prefer to have our meetings on?
[09:26:10] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: infra needs to setup a weekly/bi-weekly meeting with status
[09:26:16] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:26:25] <ryanneufeld> that's a good question
[09:26:48] * ryanneufeld check calendar
[09:27:41] <ryanneufeld> tuesday noon EST seems to make sense
[09:27:47] <ryanneufeld> though we have our standup at that time
[09:27:58] <ryanneufeld> so I'd be 15mins late every time
[09:28:13] <ryanneufeld> how about 11-12 PST tuesday?
[09:29:37] <gnarf> sure, I'll dbl check with clarkbox / danheberden for availability then - my only dislike is that tuesday is one of my "jQuery Free" days
[09:29:37] <gnarf> :)
[09:30:26] <ryanneufeld> ah
[09:30:29] <ryanneufeld> could do wed then
[09:30:30] <danheberden> i could make that time, but would an hour be the length?
[09:30:44] <ryanneufeld> at the same time on wed work?
[09:42:09] <gnarf> 11-12 PST I think is right after / the same time as the dev leads meeting?
[09:42:20] <gnarf> http://jquery.org/meeting/
[09:42:41] <gnarf> right after
[09:42:42] <gnarf> works for me
[09:45:58] <ryanneufeld> so like today, in an hour
[09:48:30] <gnarf> yeah
[09:48:34] <gnarf> except not today in an hour
[09:48:55] <gnarf> next week and an hour
[09:49:19] <gnarf> I also wanna check with clark and see if he has a good chance of making it
[09:49:31] <ryanneufeld> so in about 608400 seconds?
[09:49:54] <ryanneufeld> (it's okay to facepalm)
[11:03:55] <gnarf> :)
[11:32:35] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: how did you deal with mysql wanting a root password when it was installed via apt?
[11:34:26] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: the mysql module I'm using handles that
[11:34:36] <gnarf> thats what pwgen was used for :)
[11:38:13] <ryanneufeld> ah
[13:49:40] <gnarf> so, only crazy thing about meetings
[13:49:48] <gnarf> is that someone needs to mail a status report at the end of it
[13:49:53] <gnarf> I'll usually be taking care of it
[13:50:13] <gnarf> but in case I can't make it I assume danheberden or ryanneufeld will have me covered?
[13:50:28] * danheberden covers his eyes
[13:50:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: also, can you give me a quick refresher on the process for mailing those?
[13:50:37] * ryanneufeld ducks
[13:50:58] <gnarf> status report is easy tho - just copy the minutes! :)
[13:51:06] <ryanneufeld> who's keeping minutes?
[13:51:10] <gnarf> :)
[13:51:11] <DaveMethvin> mailing what gnarf?
[13:51:20] <ryanneufeld> I can't type regular words well enough to keep minutes
[13:51:21] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: the status updates from meetings
[13:51:38] <DaveMethvin> the ones that end up in jquery.org/updates?
[13:51:41] <gnarf> yes
[13:51:50] <DaveMethvin> i got to where i never trusted teh email
[13:51:58] <gnarf> just login on .org and post em?
[13:52:02] <DaveMethvin> so i log into jquery.org/wp-admin
[13:52:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:52:12] <DaveMethvin> then choose the category and post
[13:52:13] <gnarf> lemme make sure i have an account
[13:52:32] <gnarf> i do
[13:52:33] <gnarf> yay
[13:52:34] <gnarf> okay
