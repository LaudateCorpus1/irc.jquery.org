[13:54:46] <jqcommit> 01[13infrastructure01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/a0d02d5e2c3b16236efa47e041d836af719d0f1e
[13:54:46] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-master 14a0d02d5 15Alexander Schmitz: Add arschmitz to jq03
[14:31:44] <gnarf> arschmitz: merge that onto puppet-stage and push also please
[14:32:04] <gnarf> i'll apply the config right now --- sudo puppet agent --test
[14:32:38] <gnarf> --test is just to add some extra debugging / print everything to console
[14:33:08] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: have you done any puppet + monit ?
[14:33:29] <ryanneufeld> since i don't know what monit is
[14:33:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm going to say no
[14:33:56] <gnarf> http://mmonit.com/monit/
[14:35:07] <ryanneufeld> still no
[14:35:18] <gnarf> sure, i'm thinking we should set this up
[14:35:55] <ryanneufeld> --test prevents it from starting another instance of the agent
[14:36:12] <ryanneufeld> otherwise you may end up with more than one
[14:36:16] <ryanneufeld> at least I've seen it happen
[14:54:43] <ryanneufeld> so puppet is giving me an odd error
[14:54:44] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/54f72fcc095abe75b9a6
[14:54:46] <ryanneufeld> on that file
[14:59:43] <ryanneufeld> derp, missed the = on the echos
[15:12:22] <ryanneufeld> even worse derp, I used the template for source, not content... FML
[17:44:24] <arschmitz> gnarf: sorry didnt see your message until just now because i left work and was taking care of some stuff did you already do it ?
[17:45:18] <gnarf> arschmitz: not the merge - no
[17:45:24] <arschmitz> ok
[17:55:48] <arschmitz> gnarf: im not on jq01 so i cant ssh there to merge
[17:56:56] <gnarf> ?
[17:57:05] <gnarf> there is a puppet-stage branch
[17:57:08] <gnarf> and a puppet-master branch
[17:57:12] <gnarf> you pushed a commit to master
[17:57:14] <gnarf> merge it to stage
[17:57:15] <gnarf> :)
[17:57:34] <arschmitz> oh yeah sorry i was looking at the instructions for test 
[17:57:41] <arschmitz> but you said you already did that anyway
[17:57:46] <arschmitz> ignore me lol
