[15:03:32] <danheberden> um...
[15:03:37] <danheberden> that, sir, is a fantastic question
[15:04:00] <danheberden> and lol @ a gmail search for "pingdom"
[15:04:01] <danheberden> hahahaha
[15:05:00] <gnarf> danheberden: :)

[15:14:00] <danheberden> ah ha!
[15:23:13] <gnarf> im working on getting the email stuff configured in zabbix
[15:42:09] <gnarf> it might be a little spammy, but would you like me to add you to this trigger announcement emails ryanneufeld danheberden?
[15:42:33] <ryanneufeld> you mean the jqcommit stuff?
[15:42:37] <gnarf> nope
[15:42:39] <gnarf> zabbix triggers
[15:42:52] <ryanneufeld> might as well add me
[15:42:54] <gnarf> i have it set to 5 minutes in a bad state it emails me
[15:43:03] <ryanneufeld> at the least, I can investigate
[15:44:07] <gnarf> you can remove your own "media" or disable it on http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/users.php
[15:47:13] <ryanneufeld> aight
[15:54:31] <gnarf> okay i think i have the 5 minute delay properly in place now :)
[15:59:03] <danheberden> gnarf: yeah, that's fine
[16:05:41] <gnarf> hrm
[16:06:07] <gnarf> i might wanna up this to 10 minutes
[16:08:07] <gnarf> also trying to figure out
[16:08:12] <gnarf> why it is always sending the OK
[16:08:20] <gnarf> i think i need to turn off the OK
[16:17:12] <gnarf> i'm running through and doing package updates on a bunch of machines today btw
[16:22:27] <gnarf> also, i can tweak these over time 
[16:22:32] <gnarf> i'd rather not spam ourselves to death
[16:23:12] <gnarf> if you guys have any questions about how to set it up
[16:23:29] <gnarf> lets cover it in toronto
[16:25:22] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: perhaps in TO we should go over the whole server setup
[16:25:29] <ryanneufeld> I'm still vague in a lot of areas
[16:25:44] <ryanneufeld> kinda patchy on what's been done, needs doing and is planned
[16:26:04] <danheberden> holy zabix batman
[16:26:18] <gnarf> danheberden: I told you, I'm tuning it down
[16:26:27] <gnarf> its gotta be bad for 9 minutes before it tells us now
[16:26:35] <ryanneufeld> cool
[16:26:49] <gnarf> and it wont tell us when it goes "ok" because it seems to be telling us "OK" no matter what after 9 minutes
[16:26:50] <gnarf> silly
[16:26:58] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: any thoughts on what I suggested?
[16:27:11] <gnarf> we got time, lets go over anything you aren't clear on
[16:27:12] <gnarf> yeah
[16:27:19] <ryanneufeld> cool
[16:27:24] <ryanneufeld> I'm flying out Friday
[16:27:30] <ryanneufeld> and leaving on Tuesday
[16:27:42] <gnarf> lemme find my itinerary
[16:28:05] <ryanneufeld> my flight is at noon on tuesday
[16:28:40] <danheberden> i'm about the same - get in late friday night
[16:28:46] <danheberden> leave thurs noon-ish
[16:28:53] <danheberden> although we should have some of the day monday
[16:28:54] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/badf372bdb8b9925134c
[16:29:18] <ryanneufeld> I'm in at 5ish on friday. I have a cousin in town I'm gonna have dinner with
[16:46:31] <gnarf> anyway
[16:46:34] <gnarf> gonna let this run a bit
[16:46:37] <gnarf> and check on it in a few
[16:46:42] <gnarf> sorry for the spam in the meantime
[16:46:49] <gnarf> hope you've already filtered it however you want
[16:46:50] <gnarf> :)
[16:47:07] <ryanneufeld> I have
