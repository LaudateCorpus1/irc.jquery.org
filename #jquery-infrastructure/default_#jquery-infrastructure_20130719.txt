[05:55:46] <ajpiano> gnarf: scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin rworth kswedberg ryanneufeld guys i am the official owner of the jquery feedburner account :D
[05:55:59] <rworth> wohoo
[05:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[05:59:42] <ajpiano> now i have to figure out how to do what we want
[06:00:21] <ajpiano> there's like some weird loop going on
[06:00:48] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/1E1b3D1a0h0e
[06:01:06] <ajpiano> where the Original Feed points to a long since dead blog post
[06:01:10] <ajpiano> which redirects to the blog home
[06:01:25] <ajpiano> which must be why the feeds.feedburner.com/jquery doesn't have xml
[06:01:39] <ajpiano> but blog.jquery.com/feed is a redirect directly to feeds.feedburner.com/jquery
[06:01:57] <ajpiano> where is the actual source xml from our wordpress living?
[06:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure.
[06:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> The admin panel doesn't seem to provide much help either.
[06:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ping nacin?
[09:20:46] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: YAY!!!
