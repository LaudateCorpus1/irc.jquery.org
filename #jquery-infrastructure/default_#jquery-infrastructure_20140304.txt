[09:34:45] <arschmitz> s5fs: gnarf: any one around?
[09:34:54] <s5fs> arschmitz: hello
[09:35:11] <arschmitz> hey noticed a small issue on one of the servers
[09:35:17] <s5fs> yeah? whats up
[09:35:42] <arschmitz> when folders are removed from a repo they are not being removed from the server
[09:36:12] <s5fs> which server?
[09:36:23] <arschmitz> jq03
[09:36:26] <s5fs> i'm not super well versed on our build process and all the moving pieces yet
[09:36:49] <s5fs> hm, that's weird. i assume it was working correctly previously?
[09:36:53] <arschmitz> iv seen it in both themeroller.jquerymobile.com and demos.jquerymobile.com
[09:37:04] <arschmitz> s5fs: to be honest im not sure
[09:37:36] <s5fs> haha well what's the oldest timestamp on some of the unnecessary files?
[09:37:52] <arschmitz> i  manually deleted them because they were breaking stuff 
[09:38:28] <s5fs> okay if you had to manually delete them bc they broke stuff, i have to assume it once worked, or maybe a gnome has been deleting them at night for us
[09:38:44] <s5fs> otherwise i expect we'd have heard about this issue before. its new to me
[09:38:44] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: are they git folders?
[09:38:58] <ryanneufeld> git does not remove empty directories
[09:39:14] <arschmitz> ohhh right thats the issue 
[09:39:18] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[09:39:26] <s5fs> hahaha!
[09:39:27] <ryanneufeld> so, git clean -fdx will fix that
[09:39:36] <ryanneufeld> but will also clean out any non-git managed files
[09:39:37] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: you win the internets today
[09:39:39] <ryanneufeld> so it's risky
[09:40:09] <arschmitz> yeah what was happening is our themeroller scans directories and makes a menu from them
[09:40:17] <ryanneufeld> ah
[09:40:25] <arschmitz> and it was seeing those and they had no contents
[09:40:34] <arschmitz> so it would croak if you selected them
[09:40:42] <s5fs> oh man, yeah, that makes sense
[09:40:43] <ryanneufeld> so, arschmitz the theme roller should be checking to see if the dirs aren't empty
[09:40:47] <ryanneufeld> for step one
[09:40:50] <s5fs> ^^
[09:41:09] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: well really it should use the array that is already there and contians them but that another story
[09:41:20] <ryanneufeld> the next fix would be to update the autoupdater (node notifier AFAIK) to clean out empty dirs
[09:41:28] <arschmitz> i just didnt want to leave lots of foldeers hanging around
[09:41:47] <ryanneufeld> they don't hurt anything
[09:41:53] <arschmitz> true 
[09:41:59] <ryanneufeld> well, beyond breaking themeroller :p
[09:42:11] <s5fs> haha
[09:42:56] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/version.php#L46
[09:43:12] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: see there is an array below that the keys are the same as the folders
[09:43:25] <arschmitz> so no reason to scan directories at all
[09:44:25] <s5fs> interesting
[09:44:25] <arschmitz> and if they didnt match it would break in a different way so they are guaranteed to always match assuming its working 
[09:44:28] <ryanneufeld> so it's only scanning jquery versions
[09:44:35] <ryanneufeld> that isn't really needed then is it
[09:44:45] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: no currently they are used for two different things
[09:44:57] <arschmitz> but could use the array for both
[09:44:58] <ryanneufeld> what the hell is this doing https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/version.php#L58
[09:45:18] <ryanneufeld> is that mapping jqm version => jquery min version?
[09:45:29] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: thats to tell which version of jquery is supported by that version of jqm
[09:45:32] <arschmitz> yes
[09:45:35] <ryanneufeld> ok
[09:45:42] <arschmitz> but the keys from that match the directories
[09:45:50] <ryanneufeld> cause w/ php, now you're in my wheelhouse
[09:45:56] <arschmitz> and if they didnt it would break because it would not know what jquery version to use
[09:46:11] <uGoMobi> the script in add_version.php updates that array 
[09:46:31] <ryanneufeld> so add_version.php alters the other php file?
[09:46:42] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:46:45] <s5fs> hahahaa!!
[09:46:54] <ryanneufeld> I see
[09:47:46] <uGoMobi> note that we are going to replace the whole TR so we only spend time on fixing bugs, not in improvements
[09:47:46] <arschmitz> interesting i didnt know that that seems crazy
[09:48:24] <s5fs> uGoMobi: understood, that makes sense
[09:48:51] <uGoMobi> I have no idea why it was designed like this
[09:49:23] <s5fs> temporary solutions to long-term problems often become their own long-term problems ;)
[09:49:39] <ryanneufeld> Technical debbt
[09:50:05] <s5fs> yus
[09:50:33] <uGoMobi> but I was actually here to bug ryanneufeld about https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/issues/62#issuecomment-36111038 :)
[09:50:49] <s5fs> haha!
[09:51:21] <uGoMobi> I would like to turn on comments again in the JQM blog without confronting visitors with Disqus' XXX ads ;-)
[09:51:23] <ryanneufeld> @uGoMobi I have a meeting right now
[09:51:29] <ryanneufeld> I will do a back up when I'm done
[09:51:36] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: ok thanks a lot
[09:51:56] <ryanneufeld> ping me if you haven't seen it done by this evening (in about 10hours)
[09:52:28] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: that needs recurring backups too, yes?
[09:52:33] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i'll ping you later
[09:53:24] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I hope that I am asleep by then, but I will remind if I see you didn't get to it
[09:53:33] <uGoMobi> remind you*
[09:53:40] <uGoMobi> thanks guys!
[09:54:26] <s5fs> uGoMobi: take care :)
