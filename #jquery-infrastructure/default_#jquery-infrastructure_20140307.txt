[06:59:27] <scottgonzalez> nacin: When you're around, I'd like to find out what settings you use for spam filtering in Trac.
[07:03:47] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #247: Disable CAPTCHA on bugs.jqueryui.com 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/247
[07:05:52] <s5fs> scottgonzalez: disabling captcha feels risky
[07:06:18] <s5fs> it may not be super effective but it has to be providing at least some value
[07:08:51] <jzaefferer> recent spam tickets get rejected by akisment, then make it through anyway by completing the CAPTCHA
[07:13:00] <scottgonzalez> CAPTCHA also annoys lots of legitimate users.
[07:14:18] <scottgonzalez> Bots are smart enough to create accounts, login, maintain a session, and beat CAPTCHA :-/
[07:14:46] <scottgonzalez> And we can't even fix bugs in IE7...
[07:14:58] <scottgonzalez> What has the world come to?
[07:15:29] <s5fs> yeah last fall it seems all captchas broke and a ton of sites closed their forum signups
[09:47:17] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: we just use akismet, and probably not even configured wellâ€¦ but we also don't have anonymous users.
[09:47:39] <nacin> (that's not to say we don't get spam, but it's likely less of an issue)
[11:15:48] <scottgonzalez> nacin: We don't have anonymous users for UI, just for core.
[11:16:25] <scottgonzalez> These are our settings: https://cloudup.com/cLNSh1m9CsA
[11:16:39] <scottgonzalez> I'd prefer to completely remove CAPTCHA.
