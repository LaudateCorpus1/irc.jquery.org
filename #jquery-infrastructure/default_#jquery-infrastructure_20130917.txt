[04:20:47] <uGoMobi> it's still on commit e0f5b27 from last Friday
[04:21:30] <uGoMobi> it should be on f05cc09 (latest commit when I type this)
[04:21:32] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[10:21:53] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf
[10:31:42] <ryanneufeld> ping scott_gonzalez
[10:38:01] <ryanneufeld> ping danheberden, s5fs, ajpiano, ANYONE?
[10:38:24] <anyone> yes ryanneufeld ?
[10:38:35] <ryanneufeld> how does view.jquerymobile.com work?
[10:38:52] <ryanneufeld> also, lol
[10:39:33] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: it's now on 010f89f
[10:40:20] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: great, thanks!
[10:40:26] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: np
[10:40:33] <ryanneufeld> I just ran grunt and that seems to have fixed it
[10:40:43] <ryanneufeld> I hope I didn't break anything in the process
[10:40:44] <ryanneufeld> :P
[10:40:52] <uGoMobi> ok, worksforme :)
[10:41:15] <uGoMobi> if you broke anything, we know where to find you ;-)
[10:41:28] <danheberden> hmm, where in the hell is its repo, ryanneufeld ?
[10:42:03] <ryanneufeld> it's on jq03
[10:42:15] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: root@jq03:/var/www/view.jquerymobile.com
[10:42:36] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/node-web-git-proxy
[10:44:06] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: so in theory then that could be used for any git repo?
[10:44:20] <danheberden> that's the idea
[10:44:32] <ryanneufeld> hawt
[10:44:44] <danheberden> it was never repo specific sans the repo it pointed at
[10:44:50] <danheberden> it's just now not a python thingy, which is cool
[10:57:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm back.
[11:19:26] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: hey! no, i never got to the bottom of the cdn pingdom alert but i confirmed the url was not reachable
[11:26:06] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: thanks. scott_gonzalez I got it sorted out :)
[11:26:57] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: insulation eh? home improvement?
[11:50:45] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: huh?
[11:51:15] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: arms deep in insulation
[11:51:26] <ryanneufeld> oh, yeah
[11:51:33] <ryanneufeld> building a bsmt suite
[11:51:42] <s5fs> okay that's just awesome
[11:51:45] <ryanneufeld> soundproofing it
[11:51:59] <ryanneufeld> afk, lunch times
[11:54:10] <s5fs> peace!
[11:54:30] <s5fs> soundproofing is a good idea, i'm sure the neighbors get tired of your loud sobbing
[11:55:00] <ryanneufeld> more like loud SNOBBING!
[11:55:15] <ryanneufeld> erm. I mean SNOGGING!!
[11:55:22] <ryanneufeld> Cause you know how I roll
[11:55:29] <s5fs> hahaha!
