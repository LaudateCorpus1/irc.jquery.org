[09:28:42] <danheberden> gnarf: ryanneufeld: any idea why the bugs server is so slow? its load is pretty tolerable, and i tried restarting trac/mysql/nginx but it's still hella unresponsive
[10:41:23] <mikesherov> danheberden: seems like lots of iobound operations
[11:02:36] <mikesherov> gnarf: you there?
[23:01:57] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: I can take a quick look, but I'm not that familiar with that machine
[23:11:42] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: you there?
[23:11:48] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov ping?
[23:13:22] <ryanneufeld> has anyone noticed, that there is a git process that has been running since the 15th?
[23:13:26] <ryanneufeld> of Nov
[23:25:56] <ryanneufeld> I killed the stuck git commands, seems to be more responsive now. Perhaps someone familiar with what they are can help
[23:26:02] <ryanneufeld> the offending command was git fetch-pack --stateless-rpc --lock-pack --include-tag --thin --no-progress https://github.com/jquery/jquery.git  efs/heads/master
[23:26:14] <ryanneufeld> I gotta hit the sack
