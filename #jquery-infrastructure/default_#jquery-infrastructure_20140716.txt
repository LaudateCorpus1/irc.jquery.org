[02:04:52] <m_gol> I'm getting 504s from TestSwarm
[05:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Looks like you're having a ton of fun with our testing infrastructure :-/
[06:05:38] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: yeah... it's nice to have real mobile devices in tests and have them execute faster but the condition is that it actually works :P
[06:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah
[06:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> working devices would certainly help...
[06:05:58] <m_gol> also, it's not nice when devices disappear from api without any warning
[06:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's pretty rough.
[06:06:40] <m_gol> we were testing on iOS 6.0 since BrowserStack didn't have 6.1
[06:06:45] <m_gol> so they added 6.1 & removed 6.0
[06:06:51] <m_gol> in one move or sth :D
[06:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can understand why that's tough for them with real devices, but it certainly makes it hard for their users.
