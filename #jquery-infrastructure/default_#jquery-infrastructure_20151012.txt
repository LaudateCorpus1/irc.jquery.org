[07:57:00] <m_gol> gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld: what's the state of the infra repo branches currently? puppet-master/puppet-stage used to point to the same commit hashes, there were no merges and now I see they diverged, puppet-master has been merged into puppet-stage etc.
[07:57:24] <m_gol> I wanted to update tested browsers but I don't want to touch it when it's in de-synced state
[07:57:38] <gnarf> m_gol someone was working on stage and didn't land that stuff in master
[07:57:48] <gnarf> m_gol I'd land your change on master and merge that into stage
[07:58:08] <m_gol> will we hard-reset stage later to master?
[07:58:27] <gnarf> nah - honestly - I don't mind the merge commits on infra repo
[07:58:38] <gnarf> commit guidelines also not as important there
[07:58:38] <m_gol> ok
