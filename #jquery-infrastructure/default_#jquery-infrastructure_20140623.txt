[01:25:21] <Krinkle> Hm.. wtf
[01:25:32] <Krinkle> $ grunt --version | grep grunt
[01:25:35] <Krinkle> exit 0
[01:25:47] <Krinkle> returns a highlighted "grunt" in "grunt-cli vxxx"
[01:25:57] <Krinkle> $ jshint --version | grep jshint
[01:26:01] <Krinkle> exit 1, no highlight
[01:26:17] <Krinkle> "grunt-cli v0.1.13" for one, "jshint v2.5.1" the other (before grep)
[01:26:24] <Krinkle> is there some magic going on in jshint that makes it not match?
[01:26:35] <Krinkle> I'm trying to add a jshint.pp to modules/jquery for jenkins.pp node
[01:26:52] <Krinkle> because one of the jenkins jobs that as assuming jshint as a global failed since jenkins was rebuilt or moved.
[01:29:36] <Krinkle> both have exit code 0 before grep
[01:31:18] <Krinkle> ah, stderr

[15:09:14] <arschmitz> gnarf: s5fs: ryanneufeld: question is php enabled on demos.jquerymobile.com?
[15:09:30] <gnarf> arschmitz should be
[15:09:46] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: yeah, teh demos are PHP aren't they?
[15:11:30] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: no not on there we process them and remove all the php
[15:12:10] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: but we now have a few that 100% require it so i want to make sure they will work 
[15:12:47] <ryanneufeld> echo "<? phpinfo();" > /path/to/docroot/test.php
[15:13:01] <ryanneufeld> really fast way to test :p
[15:13:22] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: oh yeah i know how to test lol i was just lazy :)
[15:13:31] <ryanneufeld> lol
[15:13:41] <arschmitz> thought one of you might already know
[15:13:49] <ryanneufeld> a safe bet
[15:14:20] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: its just like 4 demos for right now so it should not have much of an impact on load
[15:14:29] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:14:51] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: but kinda hard to do a php redirect demo without php
[15:15:03] <ryanneufeld> true
[15:15:28] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: we must have been just blowing up the error logs on that server
[15:15:44] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: i made a spider to check crawl the demos as part of our tests
[15:15:51] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: and it found hundreds of issues lol
[15:15:56] <ryanneufeld> I bet it did
[15:17:00] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: well should not be an issue in the future
[15:17:27] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: well execpt those 2 pages we intentionally 404 :)
