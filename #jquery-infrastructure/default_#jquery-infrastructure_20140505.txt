[11:16:29] <m_gol> sudo puppet agent --test doesn't work for me on jq03
[11:16:53] <m_gol> "Warning: Error 400 on SERVER: cannot generate tempfile" etc
[11:17:03] <m_gol> s5sf gnarf ^^^
[11:17:05] <ryanneufeld> is it out of hdd space?
[11:17:26] <m_gol> tmpfs has 4 GB free space
[11:18:09] <m_gol> the given path is /var/lib/puppet/yaml/node/jq03.jquery.com.yamlSOMETHING

[11:19:52] <m_gol> doesn't seem like too little space ;)
[11:21:38] <ryanneufeld> citadel is out of space on the hdd
[11:21:41] <ryanneufeld> I'll fix it
[11:21:44] <m_gol> k, thx :)
[11:26:23] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: is it a quick job or do you need time?
[11:26:46] <ryanneufeld> I need time
[11:26:58] <ryanneufeld> I'll run the agent on jq03 when I'm done
[11:29:06] <m_gol> ok
[11:29:58] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: ping me when you finish it, please
[11:38:12] <ryanneufeld> m_gol: done
[11:38:16] <m_gol> thx :)
[11:38:51] <ryanneufeld> puppet is running right now
[11:39:08] <m_gol> I see the lock ;)
[11:39:58] <ryanneufeld> k, it's done
[11:46:35] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: the /usr/local/bin/tools/node-testswarm-config.json file wasn't updated either on jq03 or on jenkins
[11:47:49] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: I touched this file in the past (last time about 2-3 weeks ago) and then it was copied properly
[11:53:03] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: /var/www/swarm/config/localSettings.json wasn't updated either
[11:53:23] <m_gol> it's like Puppet didn't see changes that happened since this HDD run out of space\
[12:25:03] <gnarf> m_gol: the pull probably failed on citadel
[12:25:31] <m_gol> gnarf: so, what can be done for it to take those commits?
[12:25:42] <gnarf> i just forced a fetch manually
[12:25:48] <gnarf> but the next commit should have worked properly
[12:26:18] <m_gol> so Puppet has marked this commit as handled and that's why it wasn't pulling changes?
[12:26:59] <gnarf> no
[12:27:04] <gnarf> the hard drive was full
[12:27:10] <gnarf> and the git hook running "git pull" failed
[12:27:13] <gnarf> so it hadn't updated
[12:27:14] <gnarf> :)
[12:28:44] <m_gol> ah, ok ;)
[12:29:25] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15gnarf opened issue #265: Add a cleanup script for /var/lib/puppet/reports on citadel 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/265
[12:30:32] <m_gol> thx, updates fine now :)
[12:33:30] <m_gol> ... or not
[12:33:47] <m_gol> gnarf: now puppet correctly copied /usr/local/bin/tools/node-testswarm-config.json to jq03 but not to jenkins
[12:33:57] <m_gol> another git hook? ;)
[12:39:09] <gnarf> m_gol: shouldn't be
[12:39:20] <gnarf> m_gol: after puppet agent --test ?
[12:39:32] <m_gol> yes
[12:39:43] <gnarf> it shouldn't be, but is jenkins using "staging" environment in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf ?
[12:40:35] <m_gol> [main]
[12:40:35] <m_gol> server=citadel.jquery.com
[12:41:41] <gnarf> hrm

[12:54:01] <gnarf> m_gol: might of been on a "cached" version or something
[12:54:12] <gnarf> cuz i just ran a puppet agent --test on jenkins and got your change
[12:54:29] <m_gol> k, I see it now
[12:54:38] <m_gol> I've run it twice before with no change, heh
[12:58:06] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: the hdd was full on citadel
[12:58:15] <ryanneufeld> so that might have been causing some issues
[12:58:18] <gnarf> yeah - see #265
[12:58:23] <gnarf> i'm sure it was
[12:58:30] <gnarf> but like i said, it was prolly a cache problem :)
[12:58:33] <ryanneufeld> so you cleaned up the reports then?
[12:58:47] <gnarf> no
[12:58:53] <gnarf> but we need to cron that
[12:59:02] <ryanneufeld> can we just turn them off?
[12:59:19] <gnarf> probably
[12:59:26] <gnarf> but its nice to have em if we want to look at em
[13:36:37] <ryanneufeld> fair nuff
[13:36:48] <ryanneufeld> perhaps gzipping them is the right path gnarf ?
[13:37:03] <gnarf> that is gzipped ;)
[13:37:17] <ryanneufeld> I gzipped a bunch of them
[13:37:23] <ryanneufeld> they aren't by default
