[00:25:45] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 141553fdc 15Adam Ulvi: Updated the 'jquery::gitclone' module to accept a configurable timeout value when exec'ing 'npm install', since the default is only 300ms. This is used for the gruntjs server deploy, it takes a long time to complete 'npm install' since there is a long-running postinstall script.
