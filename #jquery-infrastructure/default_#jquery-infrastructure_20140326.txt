[07:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> Can someone look into https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/247#issuecomment-38692790
[09:12:28] <gnarf> I really can't right now, hoping s5fs has a chance
[09:12:56] <gnarf> rxaviers: random question - do we still need to be locking specific version of ImageMagick?
[09:13:29] <gnarf> i need to move jenkins again this week
[09:13:40] <gnarf> and we are going to upgrade to debian 7 at the same time
[09:13:59] <gnarf> so either, we need to build a .deb for the imagemagick at the right version for deb 7 
[09:14:13] <gnarf> or we need to go back to using the distro version
[09:14:45] <gnarf> rxaviers: could you test the latest deb 7 imagemagick for whatever bug was causing us to hold versions?
[09:15:07] <gnarf> Hoping to have an answer tonight if possible
[09:16:39] <rxaviers> gnarf, hey Corey, sure. I will re-read your msgs after the meeting. On no questions, as soon as I do it, I will let you know.
[09:17:04] <gnarf> rxaviers: thanks!
[12:29:51] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: what did you do!
[12:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> I tried using the actual UI to disable CAPTCHA.
[12:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like that was only half of what needed to happen.
[12:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> Silly Trac.
[12:30:33] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: yes, trac configs are insane and i have no idea if they're actually read or if config comes from space via moonwaves
[12:30:49] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: okay so whats the current state of play. is it broken and in need of repair?
[12:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm guessing trac.ini has a reference to CAPTCHA that should be commented out.
[12:32:02] <s5fs> okay lemme dig real quick
[12:32:17] <s5fs> i have 15min until my next meeting, then busy for an hour, then probably free. i'll have it resolved shortly i hope hope hope
[12:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:35:13] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: happy to help. i am self-selecting trac to be my baby.
[12:38:04] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: did you turn it off on both sites (bugs.jquery and bugs.jqueryui?)
[12:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> Just jqueryui.
[12:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> Figured I'd only break one site at a time :-)
[12:39:25] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: okay perfect
[12:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm surprised it took this long to cause a problem.
[12:42:03] <s5fs> one of the most off-putting things about trac is searching for an error and seeing posts from 5+ years ago
[12:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> Or other people just didn't complain loud enough.
[12:42:17] <s5fs> yeah hard to say
[12:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry, in another 5 years, DEBT will be ready :-P
[12:43:08] <s5fs> if i get trac on to debian 7 before then i'll be very happy
[12:46:41] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: what is your goal here, to entirely remove the captcha?
[12:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
[12:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Since CAPTCHA doens't actually stop spammers, but annoys real users.
[12:47:47] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: should i just disable the spam filter entirely then?
[12:47:54] <s5fs> or just hack around the captcha issue?
[12:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: No, we want to run the other spam checks.
[12:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> If you look at the earlier comment on that issue, you'll see the settings I changed.
[12:51:05] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: how do i repro the issue?
[12:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[12:51:22] <s5fs> i have updated the trac.ini and removed the references to a captcha strategy
[12:51:26] <s5fs> haha okay
[12:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> I guess write something really spammy?
[12:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> Like v1agra :-P
[12:52:04] <s5fs> from the screenshot on twitter it looks like someone was just creating a new ticket, so i'll do that.
[12:53:46] <s5fs> ticket created.. fixed?
[12:55:07] <s5fs> contacted twitter friend for a retest
[13:03:52] <s5fs> oh dammit, i can't seem to repro
[13:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess we'll just wait and see if anyone complains again :-P
[13:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> This sure is fun configuring Trac.

[14:03:41] <s5fs> update: trac is still broken and I have to fall on another task, I'll be back to it shortly.
[14:04:32] <s5fs> this is the plugin that is giving us trouble: http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter
[16:10:39] <gnarf> s5fs: got time tonight for round 2 of moving shit â„¢?
[16:18:27] * gnarf starts the trip home

[19:05:13] <gnarf> thx nacin !
[19:05:15] <gnarf> :)
[19:05:19] <nacin> oh, I'm already here
[19:05:19] <gnarf> forgot to look for you here anyway
[19:05:22] <gnarf> lol
[19:05:27] <nacin> I went to join
[19:05:43] <gnarf> do you guys do any spam filtering on your trac install?
[19:05:55] <nacin> we have akismet configured, supposedly
[19:06:02] <nacin> we don't have anonymous writes, so it's not a huge problem
[19:06:21] <gnarf> any chance you can let us peek at your trac.ini chunks regarding spam?
[19:06:39] <s5fs> hi nacin!
[19:06:41] <nacin> I will look right now
[19:06:43] <nacin> s5fs: hello!
[19:07:10] <s5fs> nacin: specifically i wanna see your [spam-filter] block and tracspamfilter.blah stuffs
[19:07:54] <gnarf> we somehow ended up with a very broken spam configuration *cough GONZALEZ!!!!*
[19:07:56] <gnarf> ;)
[19:08:04] <s5fs> haha! i went on to further break his breakage
[19:08:13] <s5fs> aka "rebroked"
[19:08:15] <nacin> the extent of it is [spam-filter] akismet_api_key = our API key
[19:08:56] <s5fs> wow okay
[19:09:37] <nacin> it looks like it's not actually turned on
[19:09:42] <s5fs> okay i'm gunna cut it all out and re-add slowly
[19:09:51] <nacin> so, I guess we don't use spam protection, don't tell anyone :-)
[19:11:06] <gnarf> he said in a publicly logged channel
[19:11:09] <gnarf> ;)
[19:12:08] <nacin> we have it on, but we trust authenticated users, and only authenticated users can post
[19:15:19] <gnarf> hrm
[19:31:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yt?
