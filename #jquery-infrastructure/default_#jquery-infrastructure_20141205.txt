[06:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs: See the recent deployment failure for api.jquery.com.
[06:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like `npm prune` didn't work.
[06:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we need to prune after installing, instead of before.
[06:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that grunt-wordpress was both a direct dependency and a nested dependency.
[06:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> So it was installed at the top level because it was used by both.
[06:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> So by running prune first, it saw that grunt-wordpress was still needed as a nested dep and left it there.
[06:09:03] <scott_gonzalez> That's my guess.
[06:51:49] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #306: Deployments should prune after install 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/306
[11:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> Can you fix https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/306?
[11:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, I can fix it, but I'm not sure what the process is for testing and deploying from infra.
[11:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm about to deploy all the sites to production.
[11:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> And every deploy is going to fail without this fix.
[11:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> It was fine on stage because I had an extra commit to push for each site.
[11:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> But that won't be the case on production.
[11:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[11:39:42] <gnarf> checking
[11:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> This applies to all deployments that prune and install, not just site deployments.
[11:44:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: after update?
[11:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's only once we've got the final modules we want that we can determine what we don't want.

[11:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> On a related note, in some places we update then install
[11:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> Should be the other way around.
[11:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> But that at least won't stop me from deploying these sites.
[11:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> Does puppet update instantly on a push to master or is it on a cron?
[11:49:08] <gnarf> cron - but i bumped the content deployers box for you manually

[11:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[11:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do a deploy and see if it works.
