[10:43:29] <ryanneufeld> Hey gnarf I'm actually seeing a 502 on http://download.jqueryui.com/download
[10:43:53] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: aye, i just restarted it, tried to ping rxaviers
[10:44:02] <ryanneufeld> ah
[10:44:51] <gnarf> not sure what was wrong
[10:44:53] <gnarf> it was running
[10:44:55] <gnarf> and using cpu
[10:45:23] <ryanneufeld> I think using only GET for those is a bit sill
[10:45:26] <ryanneufeld> *silly
[11:20:37] <rxaviers> gnarf, ryanneufeld, It happened previously too..
[11:20:43] <rxaviers> Weird. Anything on the logs?
[11:22:50] <gnarf> i didn't see anything in particular
