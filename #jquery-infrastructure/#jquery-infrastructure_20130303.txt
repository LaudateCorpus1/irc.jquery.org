[08:47:05] <clarkbox> corey, is there a firewall on that new machine?
[08:47:12] <clarkbox> gnarf ^
[08:50:22] <clarkbox> look like 9997 is closed
[09:04:05] <gnarf> clarkbox: are things getting stable with that port opened now?
[09:05:04] <clarkbox> yup!
[09:06:25] <clarkbox> it will probably take a day or so for the backlogged data to get synced up
[09:06:49] <clarkbox> gnarf ^
[09:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I have a sane API for managing web hooks now.
[09:34:59] <scott_gonzalez> addWebHook({ repo: "jquery/foo", url: "http;//example.com", events: [ "push", "gollum", "fork", ... ] })
[09:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> It'll search to see if a hook already exists for the URL
[09:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> If it does, it'll update the list of events.
[09:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> If it doesn't, it'll create a new one.
[09:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can build an executable on top of this and push to npm.
