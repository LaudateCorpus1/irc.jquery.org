[18:03:18] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: still there?
[18:03:27] <ryanneufeld> ish, sup?
[18:03:48] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: `sudo puppet agent --test` fails for me on swarm
[18:03:58] <m_gol> although it seems to be updating automatically fine
[18:04:12] <m_gol> (I updated the browser sets and it did pick it up after a while)
[18:04:17] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[18:04:21] <ryanneufeld> what's the failure?
[18:04:33] <m_gol> it mentions johnbender in the error message :-)
[18:04:37] <m_gol> Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Failed to realize virtual resources User::Virtual::Ssh_user[johnbender] on node swarm-01.ops.jquery.net
[18:04:37] <m_gol> Warning: Not using cache on failed catalog
[18:04:37] <m_gol> Error: Could not retrieve catalog; skipping run
[18:04:40] <m_gol> and then it ends
[18:04:50] <m_gol> ah
[18:04:53] <ryanneufeld> O
[18:05:25] <ryanneufeld> I'm not on my home computer, so I don't have my ssh keys to investigate
[18:05:32] <m_gol> k
[18:05:56] <m_gol> nothing critical as it updated for me automatically... I thought it wouldn't work at all back then
[18:06:54] <ryanneufeld> cool
