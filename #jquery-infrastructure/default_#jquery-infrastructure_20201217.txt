[15:12:38] <Bruno02468> hi! sorry if I'm using the wrong channel, but there is a rather serious issue with the code.jquery.com CDN, and I don't know if this has been reported as the issue may be local, but it's caused issues with several sites I use
[15:12:48] <Bruno02468> how do i go about reporting this kind of issue?
