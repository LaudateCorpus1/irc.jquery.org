[05:18:32] <jzaefferer> hey Krinkle, can you check why there's no Safari workers? http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2215
[05:19:06] <Krinkle> on it
[05:19:30] <jzaefferer> thanks
[05:21:32] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: same old same old
[05:21:35] <Krinkle> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/browserstack
[05:21:44] <Krinkle> Runner disconnected from the swarm
[05:22:01] <Krinkle> vm boots but doesn't hit the page
[05:22:13] <jzaefferer> crap
[05:22:43] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I'm currently working on testswarm-saucelabs (since they're publicly free for OSS, it'd be a nice thing to promote with TestSwarm)
[05:22:44] <jzaefferer> do you have a IM contact at browserstack to pass this through directly?
[05:23:13] <jzaefferer> oh well, some competition for BrowserStack might also help
[05:23:22] <Krinkle> Not on IM, gnarf got that deal. But I'm in constant e-mail communication though.
[05:24:33] <Krinkle> I like browserstack's infrastructure better, but once abstracted for API usage, it doesn't really matter where the signal comes from for us.
[05:24:45] <Krinkle> no user friendliness factor involved
[05:24:58] <Krinkle> either it works or it doesn't.
[05:26:18] <jzaefferer> With all the failures we are causing ourselves, we really don't want to deal with infrastructure issues on their end...
[05:27:03] <Krinkle> that said, I don't feel like cutting anyone loose. Just generally developing compatibility for saucelabs. More for others than ourselves at this point. Though it wouldn't hurt to run it along side. The more the better :)
[05:34:09] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: CC-ed you
[05:35:16] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[05:39:13] <jzaefferer> TestSwarm running selenium? That's weird
[05:39:23] <Krinkle> no?
[05:39:30] <Krinkle> Where did that thought come from?
[05:46:48] <jzaefferer> testswarm ticket
[05:53:47] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I don't know why, but I tend to be biased against people mentioning Selenium in a serious way (that and C#, Java and Windows). I don't like prejudice, but so far I can only judge based on past experiences..
[05:54:33] <jzaefferer> Selenium is terrible, but in a slow and creepy way. You have to use it for a while to realize it, I think.
[05:54:50] <Krinkle> I've used it, just never serious :P
[05:55:07] <Krinkle> We shutdown our Selenium Grid at Wikimedia about 2 years ago.
[05:55:15] <Krinkle> Wasn't worth the effort.
[05:55:44] <Krinkle> The QA team is looking to use it again, but with SauceLabs this time. That does help.
[05:56:17] <Krinkle> And for high level integration testing (e.g. creating account > logging in > editing a page > uploading a file etc.) it is one of the few frameworks that work. 
[05:56:32] <Krinkle> but for anything specific (unit tests) it shouldn't be used.

[09:30:36] <gnarf> ajpiano: re jquery.com#11 There is no firewall rule that I'm aware of that would be blocking that IP, at least nothing on the server. I doubt (mt) is doing any filtering higher up, but just in case /cc @chrislea to verify.
[09:30:50] <ajpiano> yeah it seemed really sketchy to me
[09:30:53] <gnarf> (commented, just duping in here)
[09:30:58] <gnarf> its a russian ip
[09:31:07] <gnarf> NetByNet holding
[09:31:12] <gnarf> Moscow, Russia, 117105
[09:31:21] <gnarf> it's a pretty big block
[09:31:29] <gnarf> 79.120.0.0 - 79.120.87.255 - T1 customers
[09:31:40] <gnarf> who knows
[09:31:45] <gnarf> i know as a higher level net admin
[09:31:52] <gnarf> I've banished some russian blocks before
[09:31:56] <gnarf> on some core routers
[09:32:19] <gnarf> there are huge blocks of "problem users" out there
[09:42:11] <rworth> do we need to tell an irc bot about the rename of web-base-template to jquery-wp-content ?
[09:50:36] <gnarf> rworth: no
[09:50:38] <gnarf> ajpiano: https://gist.github.com/012958b0083ad4634fc7
[09:51:10] <gnarf> ajpiano: looks like its getting killed inside (mt) routing firmware
[09:52:48] <gnarf> rworth: the "irc bot" is actually configured "on" the repo
[09:52:59] <gnarf> 11:34 jqcommit: [jquery-wp-content] scottgonzalez tagged 2.0.0 at master: http://git.io/-oc65g 
[09:53:10] <rworth> gnarf thanks
