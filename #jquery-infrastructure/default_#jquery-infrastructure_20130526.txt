[11:35:04] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: okay so I have questions :)
[11:36:15] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: I cloned the plugins repo and have dorked with your plugins-test.js, all makes sense.
[11:37:06] <s5fs> My questions are:
[11:37:44] <s5fs> 1. Where can I get a list of all plugins we wish to update? Do I just scrape this from the plugins site or is there a better source (like wp diretly or something)?
[11:39:39] <s5fs> 2. Do you have a module or script that pulls the github data, or should I just find a module that does what I want?
[11:49:20] <s5fs> 3. this is supposed to be a scheduled task, do you want it called via cron or should I just set it up as it's own scheduler? I figure if we process a module every second we'll be fine with GH and likely with WP as well.
[11:51:07] <s5fs> 4. After pulling repo data and updating sqlite, I call wordpress-update.js, is that correct?
[11:51:16] <s5fs> I think those are my questions for now, thanks!
[12:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> 1. From plugins.db https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/lib/pluginsdb.js
[12:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> 2. No need for a module, GitHub has an API for it: http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/
[12:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> You can look at https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pretty-diff/blob/master/gist-diff.js#L51 for an example of using the GitHub API from node.
[12:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> You'll want to use an auth token instead of user+pass though.
[12:03:25] <scott_gonzalez> 3. I was thinking about using cron and batching, but having a task that runs forever and throttles itself would work as well.
[12:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> If you make it a long running process, add it to the manager script: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/scripts/manager.js#L15-L20
[12:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> And make sure it does a graceful shutdown on SIGINT and SIGTERM: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/scripts/update-server.js#L80-L86
[12:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> Also, if there's an error, the script must exit with an error code.
[12:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> I've just been using `process.exit( 1 )` for all errors. The only thing that matters is the exit code is not 0 if there was an error, since the manager uses that to determine if the script needs to restart.
[12:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> 4. Yes, but you can just run the manager: `node scripts/manager.js --console` and all the scripts will run.
[12:06:53] <scott_gonzalez> You'll also need to `grunt setup` the first time.
[12:12:31] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i ran grunt setup but it barfed at the sync-docs task, I forget why. probably because I don't have a local wp install haha!
[12:15:43] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: I think this is enough info to finish the task. I'll read thru the manager.js script and will ping you again if I get stuck. mostly I'm going slow since I don't know how things are put together, lotta code to review. i do not wanna just whack away and accidently update something important ;-)
[13:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: We should get you a local WordPress setup. It's pretty easy to get everything running.
[13:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry, if you screw up something important, I'll catch it when you send a PR :-)
