[11:49:02] <mikesherov> anyone home?
[11:49:28] <mikesherov> gnarf: is it possible we can kill the hanging Jenkins jobs?
[11:49:36] <mikesherov> Mobile has a job running for 2 days
[11:52:23] <mikesherov> danheberden: DaveMethvin: anyone around?
[11:52:38] <mikesherov> looking for someone to kill a hanging jenkins job
[11:52:52] <mikesherov> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.2-stable/131/console
[11:53:48] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov i think i just killed it
[11:54:02] <DaveMethvin> i was wondering why all the core jobs weren't running
[11:54:05] <mikesherov> thank you!
[11:54:13] <DaveMethvin> but then i thought, "it's just swarmy"
[11:54:27] <mikesherov> PhantomJS: now with 25% less real rendering engine!
[11:54:56] <DaveMethvin> lol
[11:54:58] <mikesherov> PhantomJS: we now emulate Safari and Old Opera!
[11:55:43] <mikesherov> thanks DaveMethvin 
[11:55:46] <DaveMethvin> np
[11:55:54] <mikesherov> what would it take to give me the power to kill a hanging job?
[11:56:00] <DaveMethvin> just looking :D
[11:58:51] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov i don't think i have admin
[11:58:59] <DaveMethvin> i thought i had access to the admin acct
[11:59:04] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't look like it
[11:59:09] <DaveMethvin> or they changed the pass
[12:00:18] <mikesherov> my password was changed too apparently
[12:00:21] <DaveMethvin> i killed the mobile jobs in case they all hang that way
[12:00:42] <DaveMethvin> so let's see if those jobs work their way down
[12:02:07] <mikesherov> yeah, hopefully
