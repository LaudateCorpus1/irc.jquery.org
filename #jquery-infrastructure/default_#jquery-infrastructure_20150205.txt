[06:06:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez cool
[06:06:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez if i set you up a server for it, could you do a first install and take notes?
[06:07:05] <gnarf> or do you want me to
[06:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know anything about nginx.
[06:07:19] <gnarf> i can puppet that for ya
[06:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it's going to be a very simple setup. Just serving static files from a directory.
[06:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's half of it. The other half is the server that does the audits, which writes to that directory.
[06:08:04] <gnarf> and a "node service" with start/stop/update
[06:08:11] <gnarf> it has an output directory i assume
[06:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:08:17] <gnarf> also i should probably back that up?
[06:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> So it will work similar to how the plugins site worked.
[06:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, backups would be good for the output directory.
[06:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's configurable, so if there's a main directory that's already being backed up, you can just set the config to point to a subdir in there.
[06:09:25] <gnarf> just the jquery-liscence repo?
[06:10:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, if you clone that, npm install, npm start, then the web hook server will run.
[06:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't pushed the last commit that writes to the output dir though.
[06:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> I need to push commits across three repos :-P
[06:12:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :)
[06:12:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hey can you see if we could support hook secrets?
[06:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can work on that after the UI 1.11.3 release.
[06:13:06] <gnarf> ++security
[06:13:35] <gnarf> do you want the server for -liscense to only update on tags?
[06:13:45] <gnarf> also i've never been able to type that word
[06:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:14:03] <gnarf> it always get hungup 
[06:14:09] <gnarf> on liscense
[06:14:28] <gnarf> lic\he\hse\hcense
[06:14:32] <gnarf> or something like that
[06:14:45] <gnarf> and then never get it right
[06:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> Just think that typing the word is as annoying as having lice, then you'll get it right :-)
[06:15:23] <gnarf> that'll prolly work
[06:16:46] <gnarf> license = lice defense ?
[06:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, the jquery-license update was just pushed.
[06:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> So cloning and setting the config will work now.
[06:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, I didn't document the new config. One sec.
[06:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> done
[06:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license#config
[06:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What domain do you plan on using for the nginx server that will point to the output dir?
