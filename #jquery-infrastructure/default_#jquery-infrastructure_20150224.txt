[07:37:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/status/?repo=esprima&sha=8f30085e0fa58d39a8bd4f438a2b2ef482428619
[07:37:45] <gnarf> not sure if aryia wasn't added to the CAA
[07:38:00] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1076
[07:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> He signed the CLA a few minutes ago.
[07:41:40] <gnarf> but never the CAA?
[07:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> He did not sign the CAA.
[07:41:57] <gnarf> he seems to think he had https://github.com/jquery/esprima/pull/1076#issuecomment-75700399
[07:42:23] <scott_gonzalez> And I no longer have access to see if he signed a one-off CAA.
[07:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> I assume he signed a CAA specific to Esprima.
[07:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> But, you know, I'm not allowed to see that anymore...
[07:43:01] <scott_gonzalez> And nobody seems to think about integrating this stuff.
[07:45:40] <gnarf> cc kborchers ^^^^ can you tell us what we need to know?
[07:46:45] <kborchers> he signed an esprima CAA
[07:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> I figured that much. What are the details?
[08:12:53] <kborchers> the CAA used in the transfer seems a bit open to interpretation on whether or not it covers future contribution so i am awaiting confirmation from legal and will let you know
[08:14:29] <gnarf> kborchers: he signed the CLA anyway, so i think we are covered
[08:14:44] <kborchers> sure but good to know going forward
[08:15:13] <kborchers> and then we can update processes of transfer, adding to CAA list, etc if necessary
[08:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> The CAA he signed and the standard CAA are very different.
[08:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> I can say that without even having seen what he signed.
[08:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Just FYI: If you're planning on having the GitHub admins not actually be owners, we're still going to be limited.
[08:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> You should really just move the non-code stuff out of the jquery org.
[08:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> Also a little strange to have the org admins not involved in whatever discussion is going on about how to administer GitHub...
[08:57:51] <kborchers> ok ... just curious, what would you not be able to do as an admin on every project?
[08:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> Create new repos, manage teams, etc.
[08:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> So if I'm not an Owner, I cannot manage any teams.
[08:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> "Org Admins" doesn't make sense as a team, because that's what Owners is.
[08:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> You cannot simulate the equivalent.
