[08:50:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you think that https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/20 is ready to close now?
[08:50:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: have you been able to restore a file from tarsnap?
[08:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't tried.
[08:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try this afternoon.
[08:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> But I think the issue can be closed.
[08:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming at least one other person has been able to restore a file.
[08:58:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'm not sure anyone has
[08:58:41] <gnarf> thats why i'm waiting for someone to confirm they can restore
[08:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'll get to that today.
[08:59:04] <gnarf> also, there might be questions that come up during that process
[09:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The tarsnap backups are stored on the same server that the original data is from?
[09:31:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: tarsnap is online
[09:31:22] <gnarf> if you have the key
[09:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:31:28] <gnarf> you can use a local binary
[09:31:49] <gnarf> I'll add some words about that
[09:33:00] <gnarf> ""Tarsnap is an online service that stores the backups in the Amazon Cloud!  All you need is the key files to gain access to the backed up data!
[09:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, re-reading this I see you wrote "Each of the keys used is stored in the jQuery Foundation & jQuery Infrastructure dropboxes."
[09:37:27] <gnarf> I should probably store these in the jquery infra repo anyway
[09:37:47] <gnarf> would ensure a newly setup machine had the right key to get to its backups too
[09:38:28] <gnarf> kborchers: are you around?
[09:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Everything worked fine. I added a comment.
[15:19:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ping
[15:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[15:20:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: got time to get distracted with the infra hangout for a bit? :)
[15:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> I have a few minutes before I need to give the kids a bath.
