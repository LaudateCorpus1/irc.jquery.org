[13:24:39] <arturo81> I am having 301 redirects since 2 weeks ago, i spoke to stackpath/highwinds cdn and they say it could be a misconfiguration at jQuery's end

[13:27:00] <arturo81> Hi Arturo,
[13:27:01] <arturo81> We have managed to replicate this for ourselves from couple of testing nodes in South America,
[13:27:01] <arturo81> and looking further into it, it is most probably a result of misconfiguration on jQuery's end.
[13:27:02] <arturo81> We have reached out to their team about this, and we'll work together with them to find a
[13:27:02] <arturo81> solution. We'll keep you updated on the progess.
[13:27:03] <arturo81> Kind regards,
[13:27:03] <arturo81> Dusan Bokan
[13:27:04] <arturo81> Support Engineer
[13:27:15] <arturo81> Is there anything we can help to get it working again?
