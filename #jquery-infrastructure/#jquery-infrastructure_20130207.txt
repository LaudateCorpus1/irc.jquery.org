[12:17:07] <gnarf> hrm
[12:17:12] <gnarf> ryanneufeld / danheberden one of you around?
[12:19:47] <danheberden> gnarf, what's up?
[12:20:32] <gnarf> danheberden: i got a weird one
[12:20:43] <gnarf> can you navigate to stage.view.jquerymobile.com
[12:20:53] <gnarf> you should see something similar to stage.view.jqueryui.com
[12:21:09] <gnarf> or rather "view.jqueryui.com"
[12:22:10] <gnarf> the dns is pointing at the right place
[12:22:13] <gnarf> but like
[12:22:20] <gnarf> i dunno why chrome keeps getting the wrong site
[12:24:25] <gnarf> i feel like im missing something very obvious
[12:25:20] <gnarf> i setup stage.view.jqueryui.com in dns too
[12:25:22] <gnarf> just to make sure it worked
[12:25:25] <gnarf> and it does
[12:26:52] <gnarf> but the jquerymobile.com one is still behaving badly
[12:27:00] <gnarf> not sure if it has something to do with the *. dns entry?
[12:29:32] <gnarf> any thoughts danheberden?
[12:32:08] <danheberden> it's def a dns issue
[12:32:09] <danheberden> looking
[12:32:43] <danheberden> gnarf - should start working now
[12:32:52] <gnarf> danheberden: ?
[12:33:06] <gnarf> what did i mess up
[12:33:22] <danheberden> oops, wrong
[12:33:36] <danheberden> oh, wait, no, i did it right
[12:33:53] <danheberden> gnarf: before http://danheberden.com/share/9226378.png
[12:33:53] <gnarf> if i use network utility
[12:33:57] <danheberden> after: http://danheberden.com/share/cf8875.png
[12:34:26] <danheberden> the problem is, dnsmadeeasy sometimes either just doesn't actually process the request when you add an entry, or it gets stuck in some queue
[12:34:31] <danheberden> either way, you have to delete it and re-add it
[12:34:42] <danheberden> it *should* show up via dig in 1-2 minutes
[12:34:45] <danheberden> if not, you should retry
[12:34:49] <gnarf> i had stage.view.jquerymobile.com. 1800 IN	A	205.186.153.188
[12:34:55] <danheberden> oh rly?
[12:34:56] <gnarf> from my dig
[12:35:01] <danheberden> why didn't i :/
[12:35:04] <danheberden> until i re-added it
[12:35:26] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1U461M2i3q2x
[12:36:33] <danheberden> gnarf, and the proxy is definitely set up correctly?
[12:36:50] <danheberden> oh, it's jq03
[12:36:51] <danheberden> nvm
[12:37:28] <gnarf> whatever
[12:37:30] <gnarf> its working now
[12:38:55] <danheberden> gnarf, it is?
[12:39:12] <danheberden> if you cat /var/www/view.jquerymobile.com/htdocs/index.htm
[12:39:14] <danheberden> i see jquery ui
[12:44:04] <gnarf> http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0-rc.1/ ?
[12:44:15] <gnarf> it says jqueryui in the index
[12:44:19] <gnarf> need to fix that
[12:44:26] <gnarf> and also need to get that vhost running php
[13:35:57] <ryanneufeld> yo
[13:36:08] <ryanneufeld> sorry was afk eating sushi
