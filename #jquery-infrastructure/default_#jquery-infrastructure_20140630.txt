[00:02:55] <Cork> <mstefanko> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js 502 bad gateway
[00:03:07] <Cork> is this intentional?seams like a symlink for jquery.min.js has been lost
[00:03:17] <Cork> jquery-latest.pack.js and jquery-latest.js seams to be affected too
[00:48:40] <Cork> gnarf: ping
[00:50:41] <s5fs> Cork: hi
[00:50:53] <Cork> s5fs: hi
[00:51:16] <s5fs> Cork: I think the 502 is correct, 'latest' isn't supposed to be used in production so i don't think it's hosted on the cdn
[00:51:43] <Cork> s5fs: from the reports it was there until a few hours ago
[00:52:02] <Cork> but ya, it isn't listed on the cdn so not really surprise
[00:52:17] <Cork> ok, so i'll tell them to change the link
[00:52:24] <s5fs> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/10
[00:53:46] <s5fs> Cork: I see you left a note in #jquery-dev as well, thank you
[00:53:56] <Cork> s5fs: np
[06:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: It's supposed to be there, just to support existing sites that were already using it.
[06:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> It is there though. I'm assuming this is a problem with a specific node in the CDN.
[06:28:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah it looks like that to me seems like it might be geographical
[06:56:33] <jdorfman> hey scott_gonzalez 
[06:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[06:56:57] <jdorfman> there seems to be an issue with the origin, that is what I am told
[07:00:55] <jdorfman> can we hop on a call scott_gonzalez ?
[07:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> We can, but I won't be any help. I don't manage the servers.
[07:03:38] <jdorfman> ok how can we resolve this?  SHould I call Kris or Corey?
[07:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> Corey would be the most helpful.
[07:03:59] <jdorfman> k
[07:07:58] <jdorfman> talking with Kris. Looks like the origin is down hard from each PoP - http://tools.maxcdn.com/http?d1=http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js&d2=https://codeorigin.jquery.com/?view
[07:15:27] <kborchers> gnarf: s5fs ryanneufeld need help if any of you are around

[07:21:43] <kborchers> thank you gnarf 
[07:21:59] <gnarf> nginx: [emerg] could not build the variables_hash, you should increase either variables_hash_max_size: 512 or variables_hash_bucket_size: 64
[07:22:15] <gnarf> thats a message from nginx on codeorigin
[07:22:50] <jdorfman> variables_hash_max_size: 512 or variables_hash_bucket_size: 64

[07:45:52] <jdorfman> ok perfect
[07:46:04] <gnarf> i have an include conf.d/*.conf in the http{} block, but it didn't work in there
[07:46:13] <gnarf> i had to edit the actual nginx.conf and put it inside the http
[07:46:36] <jdorfman> and then just a reload or do you have to restart nginx
[07:46:44] <gnarf> it was actually stop stopped
[07:46:48] <gnarf> it wouldn't start without it
[07:49:33] <jdorfman> word thanks g
[07:51:32] <jdorfman> heading off to work thanks everyone for there help
[11:01:17] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: Does my current patch address your concerns? I found that wordpress does a lot of fuckery to urls in the templates, I found all the ones that were generated and sorted those out. The rest are hard coded and seemingly updated/modified on output by wp somewhere to have the correct protocol
[11:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's not WordPress rewritin the URLs, that's our own plugin.
[11:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's what makes local and stage actually work.
[11:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> The updates certainly look better. I'll pull and do some local testing.
[11:04:51] <ryanneufeld> ok
[11:05:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna update the commit message on one of my commits and reset the author. I used the web editor... 
[12:45:25] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: fixed the comments you made :)
