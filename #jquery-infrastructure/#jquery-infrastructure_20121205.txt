[00:00:45] <Krinkle> clarkbox: why are 404s not cached in the first place
[06:51:30] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: 404s
[06:51:33] <ryanneufeld> are not cached because they might not always be a 404
[06:51:49] <Krinkle> sure, so cache them for 24h?
[06:51:54] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: as for the PHP error, what machine are you seeing them on?
[06:51:59] <Krinkle> which error?
[06:52:08] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: the one you just posted here
[06:52:14] <Krinkle> ah, that one.
[06:52:21] <Krinkle> I see that when I open php from the command line
[06:52:37] <Krinkle> we don't log E_DEPRECATED and E_NOTICE  from production webservers.
[06:52:38] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: I don't recall saying that myself
[06:52:50] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: so you're not seeing that on production servers?
[06:52:54] <Krinkle> but its not the error that matters, the message rather ;-)
[06:53:13] <Krinkle> gnarf created that file recently since we needed it (which is good) but presumably used the old style comment syntax.
[06:53:19] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: the PHP Deprecated, are you seeing it on production?
[06:53:33] <Krinkle> <Krinkle> we don't log E_DEPRECATED and E_NOTICE  from production webservers.
[06:53:40] <Krinkle> <Krinkle> I see that when I open php from the command line
[06:53:41] <Krinkle> :)
[06:53:49] <ryanneufeld> On which machine?
[06:53:52] <ryanneufeld> Yours personally?
[06:53:52] <Krinkle> jq03
[06:54:02] <ryanneufeld> So on a producton machine
[06:54:05] <Krinkle> Sure
[06:54:17] <Krinkle> but it'll show on any machine after gnarf syncs that file with puppet (which was his intention)
[06:54:19] <ryanneufeld> don't you have root on that box?
[06:54:27] <Krinkle> Maybe
[06:54:28] <Krinkle> not sure
[06:54:32] <Krinkle> why?
[06:55:52] <ryanneufeld> if you have root, you can fix the problem
[06:56:51] <ryanneufeld> problem gone now?
[06:57:58] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: I don't see a puppet conf for making you an admin on that box
[06:58:12] <ryanneufeld> I've gone ahead and changed the comments to the ; style
[06:58:43] <Krinkle> oh on jq03, I know I have root there
[06:59:09] <Krinkle> I didn't fix it because I wanted gnarf to know since I thought he already spreaded it to other machines.
[06:59:11] <Krinkle> I guess not>?
[06:59:21] <ryanneufeld> it's not in puppet
[06:59:39] <Krinkle> depr. error is gone now indeed
[07:00:02] <Krinkle> jq03$ php --version

[07:00:13] <Krinkle> (that was the full error)
[07:00:48] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I've seen it before. PHP is my day job :)
[07:01:02] <Krinkle> np :)
[07:01:08] <Krinkle> cool
[07:01:09] <ryanneufeld> Any how, if you see that on other machines, you can just fix it.
[07:01:16] <Krinkle> alright, will do.
[07:01:17] <ryanneufeld> you have the puppet configs checkouted right?
[07:01:25] <Krinkle> yes
[07:01:45] <Krinkle> (i have a local clone of jquery/infrastrucure if that's what you're asking)
[07:01:59] <ryanneufeld> (it is) k, so with something like that, check in the manifests, make sure that the file isn't being added by puppet.
[07:02:55] <ryanneufeld> if it's not, you can/should just fix it. Giving gnarf and myself a heads up is probably a good idea too. But for something like this where it's fairly low risk, go ahead and fix it if you know how
[07:03:59] <gnarf> i was gonna put it on all the php machines
[07:04:04] <gnarf> mornin btw
[07:04:12] <ryanneufeld> and to you
[07:04:18] <ryanneufeld> stranger :p
[07:04:45] <gnarf> sorry, been a little afk
[07:06:49] <gnarf> clarkbox: i don't want those images available, the 404s seem the "easy target" but they are also the least bandwidth/cpu/everything else cost request any of the servers sends... If you prefer, I would rather issue 410 Gone's
[07:07:10] <ryanneufeld> +1
[07:07:19] <ryanneufeld> afk, train to catch
[07:07:26] <ryanneufeld> I'll be around throughout the day
[11:01:04] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I'm not gonna make to the infra meeting today.
[11:01:09] <ryanneufeld> gotta thing at work
[12:27:01] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I can touch base again this afternoon if that works for you
[12:27:13] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: skype call?
[12:27:26] <gnarf> i wanna chat quick about that backup
[12:27:28] <ryanneufeld> yeah, in an hour?
[12:27:37] <gnarf> sounds good
[12:27:39] <ryanneufeld> k
[12:33:33] <ryanneufeld> what time have you got gnarf?
[12:36:12] <gnarf> 2:30
[12:36:39] <ryanneufeld> I can do 3p your time?
[12:36:53] <gnarf> sure
[12:37:05] <ryanneufeld> k
[12:37:18] <ryanneufeld> I"ll call you, gotta switch to laptop for it. no mic on this box
[13:24:38] <ajpiano> do we have a place where we're aggregating various docs.jquery.com urls that we know 100% are going to have to have custom redirects once we shut down docs.jquery.com
[13:56:17] <ryanneufeld> I do not know of any
[13:56:28] <ryanneufeld> but that doesn't mean there isn't one ajpiano
[13:56:36] <ajpiano> i don't think there is
[13:56:47] <ajpiano> i''ll open an issue
