[11:05:03] <mikesherov> gnarf: you'll be around 5ish?
[12:37:44] <mikesherov> gnarf: ping?
[12:37:48] <mikesherov> ?ping
[12:37:52] <b-ot> mikesherov, pong
[13:43:31] <gnarf> mikesherov: hey
[13:43:39] <mikesherov> hey!
[13:43:45] <mikesherov> there he is
[13:44:32] <mikesherov> I was almost through testing when I realized my jenkins is behind a VPN, and so I can't test that part locally.
[13:44:42] <mikesherov> Thankfully, we have jquery's jenkins to play with!
[13:45:16] <gnarf> :)
[13:45:23] <gnarf> do you have an admin login there?
[13:45:50] <mikesherov> no
[13:46:06] <mikesherov> I don't have any experience fiddling with Jenkins either...
[13:46:30] <mikesherov> this is the guide steve wrote: https://github.com/SnapInteractive/mergeatron#configuring-jenkins
[13:47:01] <mikesherov> the idea is to create a separate jenkins build process that doe the partial merge
[13:47:59] <gnarf> yeah
[13:48:48] <gnarf> out of curiosity, do you know why its doing set-url origin $REPOS?
[13:50:30] <gnarf> i would rather keep origin the jquery/ repo if we can and maybe use a different remote name like "mergeatron" as remote name
[13:50:36] <gnarf> i guess we can always just try it
[13:50:58] <mikesherov> looking
[13:51:31] <mikesherov> so, origin there should be jquery/jquery
[13:51:44] <gnarf> that would be upstream i think
[13:52:04] <gnarf> ${REPOSITORY_URL} looks like it is supposed to be the remote with the pull content
[13:52:22] <mikesherov> oh, wait, yeah
[13:52:33] <gnarf> im just going to change that to mergeatron
[13:52:43] <gnarf> and leave origin alone
[13:52:47] <mikesherov> let me look at this for a sec
[13:53:07] <mikesherov> so, there's a few things here
[13:53:27] <mikesherov> one is, we need to create a github user for jquery who acts as mergeatron
[13:53:32] <gnarf> jquerybot
[13:53:37] <mikesherov> great!
[13:53:47] <mikesherov> so then you can change all the references to that
[13:55:23] <gnarf> do i need to clone this from the git@ url for mergeatron, or can i use https:
[13:56:02] <gnarf> cuz it won't let me use git@
[13:56:03] <gnarf> :)
[13:56:42] <gnarf> and man this is being very very slow
[13:57:21] <mikesherov> now, you can use https:
[13:58:05] <mikesherov> it's not doing any pushing, so https: is fine
[13:58:39] <gnarf> k
[13:58:51] <gnarf> in the config.json
[13:58:54] <gnarf> what do i want for the db?
[13:59:13] <mikesherov> ok, so you need to use my branch
[13:59:34] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/mergeatron/tree/db_layer
[13:59:44] <mikesherov> and then change "type" to "mysql"
[14:00:22] <mikesherov> I'll be merging it into master once we test this thing
[14:00:27] <mikesherov> ah, the wonders of open source
[14:01:20] <gnarf> npm ERR! Error: No compatible version found: mysql@'mysql-2.0.0-alpha4'
[14:01:38] <mikesherov> that's fun
[14:01:42] <gnarf> that should just be 2.0.0-alpha4 in the package.json
[14:01:49] <mikesherov> oh, duh
[14:01:57] <mikesherov> did a manual install
[14:01:59] <mikesherov> fixing
[14:04:20] <mikesherov> k, it's there
[14:04:22] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/mergeatron/tree/db_layer
[14:05:03] <mikesherov> once you get mysql set up on the box, you just need a username and password with create DB privs, then you can run bin/mysql_setup.js once you change the type to 'mysql'
[14:05:19] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[14:05:47] <gnarf> success!
[14:06:25] <mikesherov> haha
[14:06:29] <mikesherov> HOPEFULLY
[14:07:44] <mikesherov> ok, so if you want to start mergeatron, I'd just config the github plugin to use polling instead of hooks just for ease of implementation for now
[14:09:01] <gnarf> i assume mergeatron can register its own hooks?
[14:09:17] <mikesherov> well, it doesn't need hooks if you use polling
[14:09:20] <gnarf> bin/github_setup.js ?
[14:09:33] <mikesherov> if you use hooks, you run the bin/github_setup.js
[14:09:47] <gnarf> afk a min
[14:09:55] <mikesherov> ok, I'm going to keep typing
[14:10:06] <mikesherov> but then you need to provide a live endpoint if you use hooks obv.
[14:11:01] <mikesherov> and just on top of that, it's a bit harder to test than polling, but Iet's go for it, might as well go the full monty
[14:12:49] <gnarf> :)
[14:13:37] <mikesherov> ok, so I'd think we'd want to test it on like gnarf37/jquery at first, just so we can futz with the pull requests if we need to
[14:13:59] <mikesherov> I haven't tested the MySQL jenkins hooks yet, so it might be a disaster
[14:18:12] <gnarf> Loading plugin: github
[14:18:12] <gnarf> Loading plugin: jenkins
[14:18:12] <gnarf> Loading plugin: phpcs
[14:18:14] <gnarf> { [Error: ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE: Table 'mergeatron.pulls' doesn't exist] code: 'ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE', index: 0 }
[14:18:29] <gnarf> i don't think I have your SSH key, can you pm it to me
[14:18:30] <gnarf> ?
[14:19:03] <mikesherov> it's already on bugs
[14:19:06] <mikesherov> if that helps
[14:19:09] <mikesherov> but pasting now
[14:20:15] <gnarf> sigh, this is passing ssh urls for git
[14:20:18] <gnarf> its prolly gonna break
[14:20:33] <gnarf> that or im gonna have to set an ssh key for jquerybot
[14:21:54] <mikesherov> mergeatron is? I can change that simply
[14:22:49] <mikesherov> github.js line 156
[14:22:50] <mikesherov> ssh_url = pull.head.repo.ssh_url,
[14:23:43] <mikesherov> change that to clone_url
[14:24:02] <gnarf> yeah - that might break private repos tho
[14:24:11] <gnarf> i'll just make sure jenkins has ssh for jquerybot
[14:24:42] <gnarf> this BRANCH_NAME param sent to jenkins
[14:24:53] <gnarf> is it remote/BRANCH_NAME or no?
[14:24:55] <mikesherov> well, as long as jquerybot has access to those private repos, it's fine.
[14:25:17] <mikesherov> it is remote/BRANCH_NAME
[14:25:24] <mikesherov> the way git checkout works
[14:25:47] <gnarf> so its origin/BRANCH_NAME ?
[14:25:55] <gnarf> so i have to use origin badly? :)
[14:26:19] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/9f83fd8bab500f247df7
[14:26:28] <gnarf> thats what I see this pre-runner script looking like to be "safest"
[14:26:38] <gnarf> because you know, people file pulls on their own "master" all the time
[14:27:06] <mikesherov> well you're gist still has origin
[14:27:14] <mikesherov> all refs need to change to mergeatron
[14:27:55] <mikesherov> you don't want to checkout upstream/master
[14:28:39] <mikesherov> in the original example, origin is jquery/jquery
[14:28:56] <mikesherov> I think the example is wrong, ugh
[14:28:57] <gnarf> no it isn't
[14:29:03] <gnarf> upstream is jquery
[14:29:06] <gnarf> origin is the remote
[14:29:16] <gnarf> look at what its doing
[14:29:18] <mikesherov> is mergeatron's remote?

[14:29:21] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-master 143a9b74f 15Corey Frang: Adding @mikesherov to jq03
[14:29:25] <gnarf> its pulling "upstream master" 
[14:29:44] <mikesherov> right
[14:29:55] <mikesherov> right
[14:30:01] <gnarf> you should be able to ssh mikesherov@jq03.jquery.com mike
[14:30:04] <gnarf> please change your pass
[14:30:08] <gnarf> the default coming in a PM
[14:30:26] <mikesherov> k
[14:30:35] <gnarf> im playing around in /usr/local/mergeatron
[14:30:42] <mikesherov> ok
[14:30:49] <mikesherov> so wait, now even I'm confused
[14:31:56] <mikesherov> Wait, so I think in the example, origin is the pull requestors remote
[14:32:01] <gnarf> yup
[14:32:19] <mikesherov> so, then that makes sense
[14:32:23] <gnarf> i changed the remote name to "mergeatron"
[14:32:40] <gnarf> rather than mess with upstream
[14:32:51] <mikesherov> rather than mess with ORIGIN
[14:33:14] <mikesherov> or are you saying that origin is already jquery/jquery
[14:33:23] <mikesherov> and you don't want to alias upstream to the same thing?
[14:34:26] <gnarf> that
[14:34:28] <gnarf> :)
[14:34:37] <gnarf> okay i think I have jenkins setup now
[14:34:49] <mikesherov> wait, but your gist is wrong:
[14:34:51] <mikesherov> git checkout upstream/${BRANCH_NAME}
[14:35:06] <mikesherov> should be git checkout mergeatron/${BRANCH_NAME}
[14:35:52] <mikesherov> so what jenkins should do is update local master to jquery/jquery master
[14:36:03] <mikesherov> then checkout the pull requestors branch
[14:36:03] <gnarf> yeah, it doesn't need to do that either
[14:36:10] <gnarf> it can git merge origin/master
[14:36:31] <mikesherov> sure
[14:36:43] <mikesherov> oh, without pulling done
[14:36:45] <mikesherov> down*
[14:36:55] <mikesherov> that makes sene
[14:37:33] <mikesherov> so, if Jenkins is set up, and you changed the config of mergeatron to use hooks
[14:37:44] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/7050875c2aff878235b6
[14:37:54] <gnarf> mergeatron won't start
[14:37:59] <gnarf> complaining about an sql db i think
[14:38:14] <mikesherov> k
[14:38:17] <mikesherov> lemme jump on
[14:40:47] <gnarf> so, next question
[14:41:04] <gnarf> i gotta set up a separate mergeatron for every project?
[14:41:43] <gnarf> also, you change password yet mikesherov ?
[14:41:48] <mikesherov> yes
[14:44:09] <mikesherov> gnarf: weird, looks like the mysql setup didn't create the tables
[14:44:17] <mikesherov> I went ahead and made them manually
[14:44:28] <mikesherov> let's try that again
[14:44:47] <mikesherov> I'm going to try executing
[14:45:47] <mikesherov> ok, looks ok
[14:45:58] <mikesherov> run node bin/github_setup.js
[14:46:06] <gnarf> already did
[14:46:08] <gnarf> for gnarf37
[14:46:21] <mikesherov> ok, so then now we can run mergeatron
[14:46:23] <gnarf> also, that should read the defaults out of the config instead of prompting everything?
[14:46:34] <mikesherov> gnarf: open an issue :-)
[14:46:42] <mikesherov> we're going to be hacking on it more this friday
[14:47:16] <mikesherov> well, also, it asks for github username and password, which you'd really not want to store in the config.js
[14:47:45] <mikesherov> although, it's right there?
[14:47:47] <mikesherov> yeah, weird
[14:48:00] <mikesherov> so, let's test this out!
[14:48:49] <mikesherov> I'm going to fire it up and then open some pulls against you
[14:51:49] <mikesherov> can you update your gnarf37/master so I can issue a sane pull?
[14:52:03] <gnarf> mikesherov: you can
[14:52:05] <gnarf> you have push to gnarf37
[14:52:06] <gnarf> :)
[14:52:38] <gnarf> also, i notice that all of these pulls assume they target master
[14:52:40] <gnarf> which is wrong
[14:52:47] <gnarf> you can't send a pull targeting 1.9-stable 
[14:54:20] <mikesherov> issue please
[14:54:42] <mikesherov> for ourselves, we only pull against master, so we hadn't encountered that yet
[14:55:03] <mikesherov> so, that didn't seem to do anything
[14:55:36] <mikesherov> can you check the admin on gnarf37/jquery and see if jquerybot has perms on it?
[14:55:54] <mikesherov> and also check to see if the hooks are registered?
[14:57:28] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[14:57:51] <gnarf> http://jq03.jquery.com:7000/
[14:57:59] <gnarf> hook is setup
[14:58:10] <mikesherov> ok, so iptables?
[14:58:24] <gnarf> should be allow all atm
[14:59:01] <mikesherov> well, actually, that's the correct behavior, only github's urls can ping
[14:59:54] <mikesherov> I'm going to switch to polling for a minute
[14:59:59] <mikesherov> see if that works
[15:02:37] <mikesherov> well, that certainly fills the db
[15:02:43] <mikesherov> let me tinker for a minute
[15:02:54] <mikesherov> where's the jenkins url?
[15:03:14] <gnarf> swarm.jquery.org:8080
[15:03:49] <mikesherov> ah, so it's pending, waiting for an executor
[15:04:20] <gnarf> of course
[15:04:25] <gnarf> it takes forever to do a run
[15:04:30] <mikesherov> build.started hasn't fired yet
[15:04:43] <mikesherov> so once build.started fires, mergeatron will say that it's testing
[15:05:01] <gnarf> that build in the queue btw is a manual one
[15:05:09] <gnarf> so i can find the repos location and add it
[15:05:34] <mikesherov> so it wasn't from me running mergeatron?
[15:06:11] <gnarf> don't think so
[15:06:14] <gnarf> look at the params on it
[15:06:34] <gnarf> those are the ones i put in manually
[15:06:46] <mikesherov> how do I see the params?
[15:06:53] <gnarf> hover the build in the queue
[15:07:07] <gnarf> are you logged in?
[15:07:22] <mikesherov> no
[15:07:37] <mikesherov> I don't have a login either
[15:07:45] <gnarf> the password for mysql is the same as the mergeatron user on jenkins
[15:07:58] <gnarf> if you wanna use that login
[15:08:00] <gnarf> actually 
[15:08:03] <gnarf> ill just make you one
[15:08:55] <gnarf> mikesherov / same default pass as the unix login
[15:08:56] <gnarf> change it
[15:09:10] <mikesherov> I just logged in as mergeatron
[15:09:11] <mikesherov> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/Mergeatron%20jQuery/
[15:09:16] <mikesherov> I don't see anything different
[15:09:33] <gnarf> goto the jenkins main page
[15:09:39] <gnarf> and highlight the mergeatron jquery build in the page
[15:10:18] <mikesherov> oh, so it's yours
[15:11:06] <mikesherov> so, what's weird is that I got a token back from the jenkins build:
[15:11:38] <mikesherov> d69daaa0-368a-11e2-9737-f9ee9a9c68c2 |           3 | new    | 37a6de81023837224d93c9bfd167ee8e77286231 |
[15:11:56] <gnarf> maybe it will add it after this one finishes
[15:11:57] <mikesherov> that's the sha, the jenkins job id, the pull number, and the pull status
[15:12:30] <mikesherov> can we cancel that UI 1.9 build?
[15:13:32] <mikesherov> so, you have to git remote add mergeatron first
[15:13:41] <mikesherov> then you can do set_url
[15:14:01] <gnarf> just did that
[15:14:09] <gnarf> needed it to make its workspace first
[15:14:11] <mikesherov> ok, don't fire off a build
[15:14:22] <mikesherov> I'm going to try to trigger one
[15:16:04] <mikesherov> OK, so I have an sql error to contend with now
[15:16:14] <gnarf> :)
[15:19:18] <gnarf> seems browserstack ie7 is straight broken again
[15:19:43] <mikesherov> yeah
[15:19:45] <mikesherov> ugh
[15:19:51] <mikesherov> error in demo: ugh
[15:30:49] <mikesherov> ok, testing a change right now
[15:40:33] <gnarf> mikesherov: https://github.com/SnapInteractive/mergeatron/issues/24
[15:43:10] <gnarf> mikesherov: i manually made a build to test that shell
[15:46:23] <mikesherov> cool
[15:46:46] <mikesherov> OK, almost done
[15:47:01] <mikesherov> I didn't finish implementing one part :-P
[15:48:18] <gnarf> so the build works
[15:48:19] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1540
[15:48:41] <gnarf> need to update our swarm contribute task to accept it as PR-1024 or whatever
[15:58:32] <mikesherov> ok, looks like it's working!
[15:58:38] <mikesherov> let me test a bit further
[15:59:16] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[16:01:59] <gnarf> nice
[16:05:23] <mikesherov> gnarf: so the build seems to have gotten started, but I can't find it in the jenkins admin
[16:06:12] <mikesherov> I have a job id and everything
[16:06:37] <gnarf> hrm
[16:07:00] <mikesherov> 42f8a4e0-3693-11e2-8c18-1b43e899acc3
[16:07:04] <gnarf> its possible its just not showing yet
[16:07:12] <gnarf> because there is already an executing build
[16:07:47] <mikesherov> is that true?
[16:08:12] <gnarf> the test build i did http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/Mergeatron%20jQuery/4/console
[16:08:39] <mikesherov> I mean, looks ok
[16:08:55] <mikesherov> but just wondering why the jenkins API doesn't even return that job
[16:09:01] <mikesherov> let me dig deeper
[16:09:45] <gnarf> the polling option probably isn't too terrible
[16:10:19] <gnarf> it just seems wasteful of the api
[16:10:19] <mikesherov> right
[16:10:23] <mikesherov> it is
[16:10:30] <gnarf> and polling 20 repos might get to the limit really fast
[16:10:32] <mikesherov> you can poll way less often though
[16:10:43] <mikesherov> let'
[16:10:51] <mikesherov> let's test drive it on core first
[16:11:05] <gnarf> sure, just saying eventually we want this on all the repos
[16:11:40] * gnarf taps foot waiting for IE7
[16:12:49] <mikesherov> yeah, agreed
[16:13:06] <mikesherov> so I think that mergeatron only shows the last build submitted
[16:13:09] <mikesherov> so it's seeing yours
[16:14:06] <gnarf> is it because mine is JOB 1 ?
[16:14:55] <gnarf> i used that JOB param for all my tests
[16:15:01] <gnarf> so maybe just skip past 1 in your table?
[16:16:08] <gnarf> Krinkle emailed browserstack with a report on how crappy ie7 has been for us lately
[16:16:15] <gnarf> hopefully they fix it
[16:16:15] <gnarf> :)
[16:18:36] <mikesherov> OK
[16:18:39] <mikesherov> so your job is dead
[16:18:42] <mikesherov> don't start a new one
[16:18:48] <mikesherov> I want to test a clean run
[16:19:17] <gnarf> sure
[16:19:43] <mikesherov> so, it's something with the jenkins API
[16:19:45] <gnarf> i was just testing the build script
[16:19:46] <mikesherov> or the auth token
[16:19:58] <mikesherov> because I get a jenkins build id back
[16:20:07] <mikesherov> maybe I'm getting an error message?
[16:20:53] <gnarf> i dunno how to configure permissions
[16:20:59] <gnarf> maybe there isn't permission to start a job
[16:21:02] <gnarf> but i thought any user could
[16:22:10] <gnarf> i think every user is an admin basically
[16:22:17] <gnarf> you can like get in and edit users right/
[16:22:53] <gnarf> hey mikesherov
[16:23:03] <mikesherov> I think it's the port
[16:23:09] <mikesherov> :-)
[16:23:18] <gnarf> mikesherov: can you screen -rx some of this
[16:23:23] <gnarf> just curious what you're lookin at
[16:23:28] <mikesherov> k
[16:23:33] <mikesherov> one sec
[16:23:50] <gnarf> sudo screen -rx actually
[16:26:25] <mikesherov> woah
[16:26:27] <mikesherov> cool
[16:28:45] <gnarf> you're root
[16:28:49] <gnarf> root has a my.cnf
[16:29:39] <mikesherov> I see
[16:29:48] <mikesherov> so, authentication required it says
[16:30:39] <mikesherov> gnarf: is token enough?
[16:30:48] <gnarf> it should be
[16:32:00] <mikesherov> let me check the grunt task
[16:33:16] <mikesherov> I think it needs a username?
[16:33:29] <mikesherov> not just a token?
[16:33:43] <mikesherov> or just better permissions?
[16:34:05] <mikesherov> how do the current hooks trigger testswarm?
[16:34:41] <gnarf> found it
[16:34:43] <gnarf> one sec
[16:34:52] <gnarf> found a permissions file
[16:35:23] <gnarf> trying to find an interface to edit it
[16:35:26] <gnarf> cuz the format sucks
[16:37:36] <gnarf> mikesherov: try now
[16:37:39] <mikesherov> k
[16:39:08] <gnarf> hrm
[16:39:38] <gnarf> restarting jenkins
[16:39:40] <gnarf> just to make sure
[16:40:50] <mikesherov> i think it's because of the security model
[16:40:59] <gnarf> looking around
[16:41:01] <mikesherov> I think I have to pass the username
[16:41:05] <gnarf> maybe
[16:41:26] <gnarf> try a hardcoded hack?
[16:42:10] <mikesherov> trying
[16:42:31] <mikesherov> PM me mergeatron's pwd for jenkins
[16:43:08] <gnarf> should be same as db
[16:45:29] <mikesherov> k, checking
[16:45:37] <mikesherov> so close
[16:47:36] <mikesherov> So that worked!
[16:48:00] <mikesherov> mergeatron though passes in "origin/test" as the branch name
[16:48:02] <gnarf> i fixed the build script
[16:48:11] <mikesherov> oh, you did it already?
[16:48:14] <mikesherov> you're the man
[16:48:18] <gnarf> it does sed "s/origin\///" on the branch name
[16:48:19] <gnarf> :)
[16:48:29] <gnarf> also updated the issue on mergeatron/
[16:48:34] <mikesherov> or woman, or whatever non binary gender you ascribe too :-)
[16:51:00] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1541
[16:51:01] <gnarf> nice
[16:51:02] <gnarf> :)
[16:51:48] <gnarf> so the status api is failing
[16:51:56] <gnarf> lemme add jquerybot to gnarf37/
[16:52:22] <mikesherov> ok, let's kill that run
[16:52:24] <mikesherov> and try another time
[16:52:29] <gnarf> um
[16:52:34] <gnarf> its hard to delete a job from testswarm
[16:52:35] <gnarf> but ok
[16:52:40] <gnarf> just kill the run
[16:52:40] <mikesherov> oh
[16:52:41] <gnarf> :)
[16:52:52] <mikesherov> I mean, let's just do what we gotta
[16:52:55] <gnarf> found the password
[16:52:55] <mikesherov> :-P
[16:52:57] <gnarf> i deleted it
[16:53:03] <mikesherov> k
[16:54:18] <gnarf> more than one node daemon might run there
[16:54:19] <gnarf> i dunno
[16:54:37] <mikesherov> sorry
[16:54:42] <gnarf> np ;)
[16:54:49] <gnarf> puppet will restart it
[16:57:49] <mikesherov> xargs!
[16:57:57] <mikesherov> you should just use xargs to kill it
[16:59:17] <mikesherov> :-P
[16:59:27] <mikesherov> oh
[17:00:10] <mikesherov> cool: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/pull/3
[17:00:14] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[17:00:16] <mikesherov> build status
[17:00:19] <gnarf> yah
[17:00:46] <mikesherov> so, not sure why your jenkins can't just use tokens, but I'll modify the config
[17:00:46] <gnarf> so if we switch it to jquery/ and let it fly it should work
[17:00:56] <mikesherov> theoretically
[17:01:06] <mikesherov> I'm going to code up the changes locally
[17:01:18] <mikesherov> I have to go in 5 minutes or so
[17:01:22] <mikesherov> right in the nick of time
[17:01:24] <mikesherov> good stuff
[17:01:41] <gnarf> so
[17:01:46] <mikesherov> let's just get one test run of jquery/jquery and see this in action
[17:01:57] <mikesherov> we can set polling to every 10 minutes
[17:02:21] <gnarf> can we try with the hook instead?
[17:02:26] <gnarf> see if we can figure that out
[17:02:57] <mikesherov> sure
[17:03:08] <mikesherov> I'm not sure if the hook dies though if it'll do a resync on startup
[17:03:15] <mikesherov> but lets try it for S & G
[17:03:46] <mikesherov> ok, db cleared
[17:03:51] <mikesherov> switching to hooks
[17:04:06] <gnarf> a comment on the PR should do it right?
[17:04:34] <mikesherov> if it says @jquerybot retest
[17:04:47] <gnarf> lets try it :)
[17:05:15] <mikesherov> so, that didn't work
[17:05:45] <mikesherov> everything is solved with tcpdump
[17:06:10] <gnarf> try again :)
[17:06:36] <gnarf> so the hook is getting sent...
[17:06:47] <mikesherov> and we're receiving it
[17:06:57] <mikesherov> when in doubt, print it out
[17:07:02] <mikesherov> let me add some logging
[17:13:34] <mikesherov> did TCPDUMP hit the right port?
[17:14:18] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[17:14:25] <gnarf> port 7000
[17:15:53] <mikesherov> so, it's working for new commits
[17:16:00] <mikesherov> but not for comments
[17:16:33] <mikesherov> oh, no, there it goes
[17:16:36] <mikesherov> got them both
[17:19:17] <mikesherov> hmm, so the request isn't ending
[17:19:25] <mikesherov> I'm going to have to pick this up a bit later
[17:19:26] <gnarf> mikesherov: https://github.com/gnarf37/mergeatron/commit/a988e24814cb2cce145509bc479ed3f91499aa27
[17:19:36] <gnarf> mikesherov: lets try the polling on jquery then
[17:20:02] <gnarf> i kinda wanna land that commit and test anyway
[17:20:05] <mikesherov> k
[17:20:51] <mikesherov> ready to go?
[17:21:29] <gnarf> hrm
[17:22:35] <mikesherov> jquerybot needs perms
[17:22:45] <gnarf> yeah
[17:22:47] <gnarf> setting that up
[17:23:14] <mikesherov> it looks like it works though :-)
[17:23:18] <gnarf> done
[17:23:36] <mikesherov> kill all the current builds
[17:23:42] <mikesherov> I'll restart mergeatron
[17:24:27] <gnarf> done
[17:25:39] <mikesherov> NICE: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1028
[17:25:46] <mikesherov> OK, g2g
[17:25:55] <mikesherov> I'm going to land my pull requests then
[17:26:02] <mikesherov> we'll do more later
[17:26:32] <mikesherov> later man
[17:26:35] <mikesherov> thanks again
[17:26:36] <mikesherov> :-)
[17:30:43] <mikesherov> gnarf: Open a pull request with your changes from that commit
[17:30:51] <gnarf> will do
[17:30:54] <gnarf> just wanna test it
[17:30:56] <gnarf> never landed it
[17:30:59] <mikesherov> Yup
[17:40:36] <gnarf> the whole world waits on ie7 ajax again
[17:40:37] <gnarf> :)
[18:00:57] <gnarf> so i tested it locally
[18:00:59] <gnarf> worked fine
[18:09:45] <gnarf> hey mikesherov - can you merge my pull in to the version we have on the server now (there were some local changes, so i decided not to mess with it) and edit the jenkins job appropriately (i updated the readme)
[18:10:46] <mikesherov> Yes, not at the moment though, I'm out and about
[18:11:02] <mikesherov> In an hour or so, gnarf
[18:11:14] <gnarf> no prob - i figured as much
[18:11:19] <gnarf> ill be around all night
[18:11:35] <gnarf> if i don't respond in IRC - text me or skype me
[20:40:46] <mikesherov> gnarf: yt?
[21:01:34] <gnarf> mikesherov: yo
[21:01:38] <gnarf> mikesherov: Still there?
[21:01:44] <mikesherov> hey, was just about to shut down
[21:01:55] <mikesherov> so I merged in all the changes into master
[21:01:57] <gnarf> sorry, wasn't payin attention to tweets
[21:01:58] <gnarf> :)
[21:02:27] <mikesherov> no problem
[21:02:38] <gnarf> so i should pull origin/master then?
[21:02:51] <gnarf> wanna just do it?
[21:03:09] <mikesherov> you should pull in SnapInteractive master
[21:03:18] <gnarf> whats the conf change?
[21:03:36] <mikesherov> Well, I'm going to bed now. look at config.sample.js when you pull it down
[21:03:44] <mikesherov> has params for jenkins username/password
[21:04:07] <mikesherov> and I commented on your PR
[21:04:14] <mikesherov> which rebases cleanly
[21:04:24] <mikesherov> so if you could test that out, I can merge it on MOnday
[21:04:34] <mikesherov> I told my wife tomorrow would be computer free :-)
[21:05:07] <mikesherov> thanks for contributing!
[21:05:36] <mikesherov> gnarf: sounds good?
[21:07:09] <mikesherov> ok, shutting down. Enjoy the rest of the weekend! Thanks again for everything today gnarf
[21:11:05] <gnarf> um mike
[21:11:08] <gnarf> damn
[21:11:11] <mikesherov> hi
[21:11:26] <gnarf> mikesherov: ? @jquerybot retest right?
[21:11:29] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1041
[21:11:54] <mikesherov> should be
[21:12:01] <mikesherov> try a new pull
[21:12:10] <mikesherov> retest was being flaky earlier
[21:14:51] <mikesherov> looks like retest is working: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/Mergeatron%20jQuery/22/console
[21:14:54] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[21:15:11] <gnarf> mikesherov: i deleted the job in mysql
[21:15:12] <gnarf> :)
[21:15:17] <mikesherov> OK, really shutting down
[21:15:28] <mikesherov> bye!
[21:15:58] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/2c63b36ae8a8fffc3fde199ebc6cece0740e5d77

[21:15:58] <mikesherov> weird, we'll have to resync or something
[21:16:04] <mikesherov> there are edge cases
[21:26:22] <gnarf> Krinkle can you please push to both branches when you push to master?  Right now both branches are in sync, so its kinda easy :)
[21:28:24] <gnarf> Krinkle also - you are on enough of em you might just wanna add yourself to the sysadmins group :)
[21:33:21] <gnarf> mikesherov: I might have one more pull to that, to use our "simple-log" which does syslog because the init.d scripts eat console output, you can't effectively pipe the log without it
