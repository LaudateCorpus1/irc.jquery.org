[19:25:49] <tj_vantoll> gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld Not sure if anyone has reported it but all jQuery sites appear to be down atm
[19:26:10] <gnarf> tj_vantoll: not reported - thanks
[19:31:24] <s5fs> gnarf: i'm here
[19:31:51] <gnarf> s5fs: nginx seems zombied
[19:31:57] <gnarf> kill -9 won't kill it
[19:32:06] <s5fs> reboot?
[19:32:43] <gnarf> yeah, thinking i have to
[19:32:45] <gnarf> doing that not
[19:33:15] <s5fs> roger
[19:36:06] <gnarf> still waiting for it to actually shutdown
[19:36:34] <s5fs> i figured
[19:36:48] <s5fs> great timing, i just had people arrive haha :D
[19:37:51] <gnarf> hrm
[19:38:11] <gnarf> I'm thinking we might need to change sshd port on jq01
[19:38:18] <gnarf> maybe all the jquery boxes
[19:38:31] <gnarf> that or put something like fail2ban on here
[19:38:45] <gnarf> the auth.log shows a pretty steady attack of sshd the last few hours
[19:38:49] <s5fs> interesting
[19:39:05] <s5fs> i say we do both
[19:41:50] <DaveMethvin> gnarf s5fs jquery.com seems to be down ... or did you do that? :)
[19:41:50] <s5fs> still going down?
[19:42:06] <s5fs> DaveMethvin: haha not this time!
[19:42:07] <gnarf> still waiting for it to reboot
[19:42:29] <DaveMethvin> we need the fast reboot option
[19:42:48] <gnarf> okay - managed to get it rebooting
[19:42:53] <gnarf> mysql didn't shut down clean though
[19:43:01] <gnarf> got my fingers crossed :)
[19:43:06] <s5fs> me too
[19:43:43] <gnarf> also really hoping that the machine actually comes up without calling (mt) this time
[19:45:06] <s5fs> until now i wasn't aware that was a concern
[19:46:08] <gnarf> last time the machine was going through some backup or something
[19:46:14] <gnarf> and the instance was locked from rebooting
[19:46:34] <s5fs> what's the average startup time on this box?
[19:47:08] <gnarf> should be quick enough that if they answer before it boots its a problem
[19:47:29] <gnarf> starting the call now
[19:47:34] <s5fs> roger
[19:48:39] <gnarf> at least they have good hold music
[19:48:47] <gnarf> ………. don't worry, about a thing
[19:48:55] <gnarf> every litte thing, gonna be alright
[19:48:58] <DaveMethvin> i suppose now would be a bad time to put out jquery 1.11/2.1 beta 2 ?
[19:49:03] * DaveMethvin runs away
[19:49:10] <gnarf> nah, perfect timing dave
[19:49:16] <gnarf> noone tests those anyway
[19:49:19] <gnarf> they won't notice
[19:49:27] <gnarf> ;)
[19:49:31] <DaveMethvin> true
[19:50:29] <gnarf> s5fs: https://ac.mediatemple.net/support/viewrequest.mt?id=2514389
[19:50:39] <s5fs> thanks
[19:51:09] <gnarf> that was last time
[19:51:22] <gnarf> still got hold music
[19:51:29] <gnarf> still no ssh
[19:51:47] <gnarf> hah
[19:51:50] <gnarf> hotsteppa
[19:51:59] <s5fs> tuurn around!
[19:53:26] <s5fs> woah so this happened last month?
[19:55:49] <gnarf> yeah
[19:56:20] <s5fs> awesome
[19:56:38] <s5fs> still on hold?
[19:56:40] <gnarf> if its this disaster backup shit running again i'm going to ask they stop
[19:56:47] <gnarf> nope
[19:58:33] <s5fs> i see they have a scheduled maintenance right now
[19:58:40] <s5fs> http://status.mediatemple.net/maintenances/3381-scheduled-maintenance-for-multiple-host-servers-november-14th/
[19:59:27] <gnarf> s5fs: can you ssh to jq01
[20:00:22] <s5fs> nope
[20:00:46] <s5fs> still on hold?
[20:01:25] <s5fs> yeah so it looks like we're one of the affected systems
[20:02:40] <gnarf> maybe?
[20:02:59] <s5fs> i'm feeling affected ;-)
[20:03:34] <gnarf> the guy on the phone is getting connected via ssh but it denys his pubkey like a good little ssshd
[20:03:55] <gnarf> he says we aren't on that host
[20:04:28] <s5fs> regardless i'm still feeling affected
[20:04:32] <s5fs> still can't reach it via ssh
[20:04:37] <s5fs> lemme pop to another host and try
[20:06:08] <s5fs> nope
[20:06:50] <gnarf> yeah
[20:06:58] <gnarf> now its mgmt
[20:07:04] <gnarf> take only what you neeeeeeeeed from it
[20:07:48] <s5fs> gnarf: tracert to jq01 https://gist.github.com/aulvi/249c1ea1cfc44ee807f0
[20:07:58] <gnarf> same endpoint for me too
[20:08:00] <gnarf> nc024
[20:08:09] <gnarf> but i think that is where it normally dies anyway
[20:08:16] <s5fs> possibly
[20:08:48] <gnarf> so nice of your DD-WRT to provide reverse dns for itself ;)
[20:08:55] <s5fs> indeed
[20:09:04] <gnarf> so jq02 goes through nc025
[20:09:08] <gnarf> and makes it
[20:09:16] <s5fs> okay good
[20:09:22] <gnarf> i'm gonna see if i can find another behind nc024
[20:09:23] <gnarf> :)
[20:10:25] <gnarf> yeah doesn't appear to be anything in the way
[20:11:12] <s5fs> good deal
[20:12:30] <gnarf> s5fs so what do your friends think is happening? :)
[20:12:52] <gnarf> SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY
[20:13:20] <s5fs> haha its just nate, not sure if you met him
[20:13:37] <gnarf> yeah i think we met
[20:13:45] <s5fs> oh yeah, windows guy
[20:34:36] <s5fs> update?
[20:34:45] <gnarf> s5fs: try ssh again?
[20:35:00] <gnarf> server is back up but 502
[20:36:08] <s5fs> not yet
[20:36:29] <s5fs> connection refused
[20:37:04] <s5fs> can you reach it via ssh?
[20:38:12] <s5fs> i'm in1
[20:40:16] <gnarf> restarting again
[20:40:19] <s5fs> okay
[20:40:20] <gnarf> something still wasn't right
[20:42:11] <gnarf> we back?
[20:43:22] <s5fs> some are
[20:43:26] <s5fs> running thru all the sites now
[20:44:17] <s5fs> looking good
[20:48:29] <s5fs> okay i've got 3 guests so i'm gunna bounce. i'll review the logs more closely in the am.
[20:48:42] <s5fs> call if anything goes sideways
[20:48:48] <s5fs> gnarf: thanks for jumping on this
[20:49:07] <gnarf> s5fs: no problem, i took the waiting on the phone bullet this time
[20:49:08] <gnarf> ;)
[20:49:27] <s5fs> my turn next
[20:57:35] <gnarf> back to ~800 wordpress pages per minute ;)
[20:57:45] <gnarf> chung along little trooper!
[20:57:54] * gnarf pats jq01 on the head and goes back to mozilla
