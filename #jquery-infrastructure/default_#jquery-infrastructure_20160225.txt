[16:57:38] <Krinkle> and run npm install afterweard
[16:57:49] <m_gol> right
[16:59:11] <Krinkle> you may wanna kill the deamon as well. 
[16:59:16] <Krinkle> It'll be fine since it spawns fresh processes
[16:59:18] <m_gol> yeah
[16:59:21] <Krinkle> but might as well, it's been a while
[16:59:25] <m_gol> that I've been doing from time to time anyway :D
[16:59:36] <Krinkle> or don't, because maybe that logic is broken and we're stil using 2013 version of the parent process
[16:59:40] <Krinkle> aye, okay
[17:00:17] <Krinkle> I also usuaully check the splunk dashbaord for any new errors 
[17:01:36] <m_gol> I don't have a URL for that
[17:01:59] <Krinkle> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-GB/app/search/browserstack
[17:02:07] <Krinkle> discoverable via splunk.jqueyr.com
[17:02:59] <m_gol> I need to have an account there to access
[17:03:18] <Krinkle> k
[17:03:39] <Krinkle> Maybe cl<tabfail> or gnarf knows how to create an account there
[17:05:50] <Krinkle> Meh, it's expired and broken
[17:05:52] <Krinkle> so not much use
[17:05:58] * Krinkle sees the dashboard is empty
[17:11:55] <s5fs> hello, whats up

[17:17:51] <s5fs> m_gol: okay all set, details in a PM :D
[17:18:26] <s5fs> Krinkle: additionally you are a splunk admin and should be able to create accounts if the need arises

[17:24:26] <m_gol> s5fs: I only see arrors about exceeding the license 
[17:24:31] <m_gol> * license limit
[17:24:34] <m_gol> * errors
[17:34:27] <Krinkle> yeah, taht's what I was saying
[17:34:36] <Krinkle> our splunk install isn't usable at the moment
[17:36:43] <s5fs> I'll follow up with Clark via email, he handles splunk for us and most recently renewed our license. I don't know the licensing details, but it appears we may have the wrong "size" for us? I don't know, honestly.
[19:03:19] <s5fs> email sent, i'll ping you when i have a solution. sorry folks
