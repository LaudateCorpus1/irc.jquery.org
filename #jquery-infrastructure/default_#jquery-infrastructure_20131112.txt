[12:19:50] <Krinkle> http://bugs.jquery.com/ "The page you are looking for is temporarily unavailable."
[13:19:53] <gnarf> Krinkle: done
[13:20:05] <gnarf> Krinkle: process was locked up
[13:20:07] <gnarf> not sure
[13:20:12] <gnarf> kill -9 / restarted
[13:20:29] <gnarf> Krinkle - feel free to cc me / s5fs / ryanneufeld on any service outage
[13:21:51] <Krinkle> gnarf: yeah, I was just curious whether someone was working on it because it seemed like a service-generated error (e.g. not server level).
[13:22:04] <Krinkle> I would've pinged, filed an issue and/or pinged on mailing list
[13:22:20] <Krinkle> thx
[13:22:34] <Krinkle> also: monitoring :)
[13:22:38] <gnarf> rather be alerted to a solved problem than miss a message for an hour to 50+ irc channels open
[13:22:48] <gnarf> agree - trac is not on new servers
[13:22:51] <gnarf> not monitored
[13:22:58] <Krinkle> I mean end-level monitoring
[13:23:13] <Krinkle> That doesn't discriminate on which server it runs.
[13:24:03] <Krinkle> Do we have something that just makes ocasional checks to certain urls (bugs, wordpress sites, cdn, ..) and asserts it responds quick enough and looks like a valid response (e.g. http status and substring in response text()
[13:24:23] <Krinkle> I used to use aremysitesup.com
[13:24:56] <gnarf> i plan on trying to get monit up and running as well as zabbix which can monitor things at that level as well
[13:25:08] <gnarf> outside services like pingdom, etc work too
[13:29:59] <gnarf> s5fs / ryanneufeld - check devs-team mailing list
[13:30:01] <gnarf> :)
[13:58:20] <s5fs> gnarf: will do

[16:19:21] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: thx
