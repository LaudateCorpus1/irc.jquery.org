[14:21:55] <s5fs> the outside is grey canvas and the inside is circuit board print
[14:22:06] * s5fs is a huge nurrrd
[14:36:28] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: why did my vagrant instance of jq01 come up with apache and nginx?
[14:36:43] <ryanneufeld> it should not have
[14:36:51] <s5fs> yeah werid
[14:36:52] <ryanneufeld> run vagrant provision
[14:36:56] <ryanneufeld> it should sort that out
[14:37:45] <s5fs> sure enough
[14:38:11] <ryanneufeld> neat
[14:39:34] <s5fs> how do i test redirects locally, or do i just shove through stage?

[14:45:35] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 14fc47b2d 15Adam Ulvi: Ticket #237 - Added redirects for download.jquery.com and download.jquerymobile.com
[14:46:21] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: could you peek at that commit?
[14:46:49] <ryanneufeld> that looks like some puppet
[14:46:54] <ryanneufeld> I can't see any problems
[14:46:57] <s5fs> right
[14:46:59] <s5fs> it runs fine
[14:47:15] <s5fs> so download.jquery.com redirects to jquery.com/download, nothing crazy
[14:47:24] <s5fs> however, download.jquery.com/foo redirects to jquery.com/download/foo
[14:47:33] <s5fs> which is not real
[14:47:35] <ryanneufeld> which it should
[14:47:42] <s5fs> okay so thats by design?
[14:47:50] <ryanneufeld> I would imagine so
[14:48:04] <s5fs> okay i'll push to master and wait for a follow-up ticket haha
