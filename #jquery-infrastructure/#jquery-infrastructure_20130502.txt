[11:29:26] <s5fs> gnarf: i'm busy too, most questions will be after normal business hours
[11:33:07] <gnarf> s5fs: perhaps we should get together for a hack/onboard night
[11:33:16] <gnarf> i have some infra work i need done soon anyway
[11:33:20] <gnarf> our jenkins server is all fucked up
[11:33:29] <gnarf> and i need to fix some things on this new machine i'm trying to stand up
[11:33:34] <gnarf> you could get a feel for puppet
[11:34:22] <s5fs> gnarf: that sounds great! I think the soonest I'm free again would be sunday night
[11:34:35] <gnarf> sounds like a (tentative) plan
