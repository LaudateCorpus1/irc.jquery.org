[07:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: view.jqueryui.com doesn't seem to be syncing.
[07:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> Is the build failing?
[08:20:51] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: how is view updated?
[08:21:16] <scott_gonzalez> Through a cron + grunt.
[08:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> But I think there may just be an old mess laying around in the root.
[08:21:43] <s5fs> okay
[08:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ shouldn't resolve, but it does.
[08:22:03] <s5fs> lol
[08:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> The correct URL should have /master/ at the beginning of the path.
[08:22:10] <s5fs> i've got a meeting to host in about an hour so i'm going to keep prepping for that
[08:22:25] <s5fs> please ping me if you need anything, i'm free-ish until 9:30a pst
[08:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like view.jquery.com and view.jqueryui.com both have that problem.
[08:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> But view.jquerymobile.com doesn't.
[08:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Must be from an old bug in the deploy process.
[08:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to manually clean up those files.
[08:23:15] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i need a better conceptual understanding of our build process, i think
[08:23:25] <s5fs> okay, holler if i can be of any assistance
[08:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks.
[08:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> I can try to walk you through the process for how the view server works. I think I still understand it all :-)
[08:24:23] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i'd love that! also, you're coming to san diego, correct?
[08:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:25:34] <s5fs> ok awesome, looking forward to catching up
[08:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: I'm available now if you want to go over how the view server works.
[08:52:55] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: sorry, big boss wants to chat. by my count i currently have about 4 bosses.
[08:53:02] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[08:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[08:53:12] <s5fs> at least they're all cool :D
