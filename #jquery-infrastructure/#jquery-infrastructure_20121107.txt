[11:21:21] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: i'm trying to add the brand.jquery.org theme to new-css branch
[11:21:39] <ajpiano> i tried to cherry pick the commit in, but there's conflicts in the header, not quite sure what the right resolution is
[11:24:52] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: what header?
[11:26:13] <ajpiano> themes/jquery/menu-header.php
[11:26:36] <ajpiano> if you try to git cherry-pick b069363c into new-css you'll see what i mean
