[05:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Will you be around at all today?
[09:11:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yes - i can try to tackle those things now
[09:11:41] <b-ot> gnarf: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Great. I'll be available right after the UI meeting.
[09:35:59] <s5fs> `read
[09:35:59] <b-ot> s5fs: No unread messages.
[09:36:01] <s5fs> nice
[09:36:06] <s5fs> stage is down, looking into it now
[09:36:16] <s5fs> I have 3 hours to finish a push for my day job, grrrr
[09:37:10] <s5fs> initiating a reboot, graphs are flat.
[09:42:16] <s5fs> stage is back up
[09:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm ready.
[09:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> We should start by getting notifier-server set up to deploy to stage.events.jquery.org
[09:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> We should be able to deploy that using a test hook via GitHub's web UI.
[09:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I can just push an empty commit.
[09:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> Once we see everything working on stage, we should set up notifier-server for production and switch DNS.
[09:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not concerned with how long it takes for DNS to propagate, as long as we can deploy to the correct server.
[09:53:08] <scott_gonzalez> Because as soon as we deploy, all sites will be pulling data from the new events site to build the events list for the top menu.
[09:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> But they pull it from a local file, so DNS doesn't matter.

[10:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> That simple, huh?
[10:05:23] <gnarf> yup
[10:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm setting up the web hooks now.
[10:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like I'll need to push an empty commit. It only sends a zen payload to start.
[10:08:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can i get rid of these custom proxies? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/manifests/wp/jqueryorg.pp#L27-L54
[10:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what those are doing.
[10:09:17] <gnarf> redirecting requests for older years to the old events server
[10:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> events.jquery.org/2010 is just a 403
[10:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is this starts with 2010?
[10:09:53] <gnarf> 200? and 201[0-2]
[10:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, when we deploy to production, those will go away.
[10:10:09] <gnarf> okay, gonna get rid of it
[10:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> Just pushed to master, we'll see what happens.
[10:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, also, jquery-wp-content has been having some issues with stage.
[10:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> The deploys just don't happen some times (maybe always).

[10:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's owned by root right now, which doesn't seem right.
[10:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> So far no email for stage.events.jquery.org either.
[10:11:59] <gnarf> hrm
[10:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> "We couldnâ€™t deliver this payload: Service Timeout"
[10:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna try again.
[10:12:42] <gnarf> one sec, rebooting that service on jq02
[10:14:32] <gnarf> scott: did you put it on json?
[10:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> no
[10:15:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: try test deploy again
[10:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> Worked that time.
[10:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> So now we wait for the email...
[10:15:51] <gnarf> its building now
[10:16:48] <gnarf> pushing images now
[10:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO! Other sites are working!
[10:17:31] <gnarf> merging this code over to puppet-master
[10:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let me know when we're good to go with the production deploy.

[10:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the first deploy is pretty big. Lots of resources for the old events.
[10:20:09] <gnarf> its up to 2014
[10:21:02] <gnarf> done
[10:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...we're missing the banner image.
[10:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Weird, as I was copying the URL, it loaded.
[10:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> Are we good to go with production now?
[10:23:08] <gnarf> um
[10:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> The config probably needs the proxy setting because of DNS.
[10:23:22] <gnarf> yes
[10:23:25] <gnarf> it has it
[10:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:23:29] <gnarf> i just confirmed
[10:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna edit my /etc/hosts before I tag so I can watch.
[10:23:48] <gnarf> scroll down from the first infra commit, the "$otherWpServer"
[10:24:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this one is going to wp-02
[10:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> 104.16.14.15, right?
[10:25:05] <gnarf> no, pm'ed
[10:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> tagged and pushed
[10:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> hook successfully sent
[10:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> ah crap
[10:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> Forgot to deploy jquery-wp-content to production.
[10:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so now we should see the stage problem.
[10:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-wp-content is going to deploy to production, but not stage.
[10:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, stage has been failing since 9/30.

[10:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> jq01
[10:30:49] <gnarf> no such thing
[10:30:53] <gnarf> jq01 is dead
[10:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, whoever did this never updated the hooks :-)
[10:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/settings/hooks
[10:32:32] <gnarf> it deployed on the things that matter
[10:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> Except not to stage.
[10:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> What's the DNS TTL?
[10:34:35] <gnarf> fixed
[10:34:41] <gnarf> its "auto" ~60 minutes
[10:35:08] <gnarf>  but probably actually much less
[10:35:13] <gnarf> shows around 180 seconds for me
[10:35:40] <gnarf> let me know when to flip it?
[10:36:11] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as this deploy finishes.
[10:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> So you can probably flip it now.
[10:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> There are probably some scripts or configs that can go away for deploying web-events.
