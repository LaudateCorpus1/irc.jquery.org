[05:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oy. 42 dead repos on the plugins site.
[05:54:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: out of 1504 repos that does not actually seem that bad
[05:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually 1,614 :-)
[05:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> At least with the few weeks old data I'm working with.
[05:56:38] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i just added up the numbers on the front of plugins.jquery.com
[05:56:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: but i didnt think there would be dups that way
[05:57:09] <arschmitz> things that fall in multiple catagories 
[05:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, well, that wil get dups, but it also only shows the most popular tags, not all tags.
[05:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> So it's doubly wrong :-P
[05:58:56] <arschmitz> oh yeah i wasn't even paying attention it would seem :) 
[05:59:36] <arschmitz> i just saw you say 42 dead and thought to my self i wonder how many thats out of and was like i bet i can see it some how from plugins.jquery.com
[05:59:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: actually that would be a good thing to add to the front total # of plugins
[06:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> Good idea. Filed: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/143
[06:00:46] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #143 by scottgonzalez (9s ago): Show total number of plugins on home page
[06:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm trying to REDUCE our issue count :-P
[06:01:09] <arschmitz> lol
[06:01:10] <arschmitz> sorry
[06:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, I think I closed 4 issues while this script was running to find the dead repos.
[06:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> So we're still ahead :-)
[06:01:46] <arschmitz> nice
[06:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> Wow. A lot of people rename their repos.
[06:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> I've looked at 7 of them so far, 5 of them are renames, 2 are deletions.
[06:05:19] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: huh dont think iv ever renamed a repo more then 5 minutes after i made it 
[09:46:40] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm:-Install-&-Upgrade#create-users (somewhat outdated, but it is the one secure online place where the password is in plaintext fyi)
[10:28:14] <Krinkle> Updated https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm:-Install-&-Upgrade#create-users to reflect latest status
[12:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, I'm copying all of the plugin repos from plugins.jquery.com. This might take a while.
[12:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I should zip this up first, shouldn't I?
[12:05:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: might speed things up a little
[12:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> How do I do that?
[12:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> tar -xokjfaoisefhlaskghalskjgvlasfa directory?
[12:07:49] <arschmitz> i always tar cvf filename.tar directoryname then gzip -9 filename.tar
[12:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> Damn, just tarring is taking a long time.
[12:13:27] <arschmitz> well over 1000 repos i imagine thats pretty big
[12:13:41] * scott_gonzalez wonders how much time the verbose option added.
[12:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the answer was apparently `tar zvcf` to do it in one step.
[12:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> Or just `tar zcf` to avoid the super noisy output :-P
[12:15:24] <arschmitz> eh saving steps is for suckers lol
[12:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> tar is still running...
[12:16:40] <arschmitz> im surious what the final file size will be
[12:16:44] <arschmitz> curious 
[12:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> Coming up on 10 minutes of tarring...
[12:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: 2.0G repos.tar.gz
[12:33:18] <arschmitz> hmm not tooooooo bad
[12:33:26] <arschmitz> for that many repos
[12:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> scp ETA is 47 minutes.
[12:34:30] <arschmitz> what do you have for an internet connection?
[12:35:43] <scott_gonzalez> FIOS
[12:36:03] <arschmitz> lucky we were just talking about Fios this morning
[12:36:07] <arschmitz> cant get it here
[12:36:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure Verizon actually limits the bandwidth to get people to pay more.
[12:36:28] <arschmitz> just have regular old TWC Roadrunner 
[12:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> Brand new neighborhood = FIOS :-)
[12:36:40] <scott_gonzalez> No FIOS across the street :-P
[12:36:43] <arschmitz> yeah its not available in maine at all
[12:37:00] <arschmitz> the only option in most of maine is Time Warner and roadrunner
[12:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> 3.2G before zipping.
[12:37:26] <arschmitz> so zipping helped a lot for sure
[12:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> Aren't those the same thing?
[12:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> Time Warner and Road Runner
[12:38:54] <arschmitz> time warner is the company road runner is service
[12:39:03] <arschmitz> oh i see what you mean because i said and 
[12:39:07] <arschmitz> yeah same thing 
[12:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> I enjoy not being locked into a shitty cable provider anymore.
[12:40:57] <arschmitz> yeah im sure
[12:41:14] <arschmitz> i dont like time warner at all
[12:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> No landline, no cable TV, and we're on a month-to-month service for FIOS.
[12:41:29] <arschmitz> nice
[12:41:51] <arschmitz> we only have cable TV for hockey my wife is a HUGE Boston Bruins fan
[13:48:41] <ryanneufeld> We only have one cable provider here that does contracts
[13:48:47] <ryanneufeld> but it's not very popular
[13:48:51] <ryanneufeld> so no one else does it
