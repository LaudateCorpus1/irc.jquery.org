[11:36:28] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: if memory serves, i just need a method to push data back into wordpress
[11:37:00] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: yeah, it was before i knew you. its hurtful having code reviewed by your afro avatar, haha! "who is this guy??"
[11:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[11:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll check out what you've got and try to add a method for updating the data in WordPress.
[11:38:50] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: hang back on that, lemme review my code first and ensure i have the most recent stuff up in my PR
[11:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
