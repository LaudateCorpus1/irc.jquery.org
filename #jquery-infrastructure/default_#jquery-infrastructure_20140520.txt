[10:26:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did you see that the stage contribute deploys are failing?
[10:26:34] <gnarf> minimatch error?
[10:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yeah, I'm going to look into it once I'm done with my day of meetings.
[10:28:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe we should bump to 0.10 already?
[10:28:32] <gnarf> let me know what you discover
[10:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: `npm install` for contribute is working fine for me locally.
[10:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> `npm prune`, `npm install`, `npm update` doesn't fail either.
[10:53:50] <gnarf> on the server?
[10:54:35] <gnarf> npm update is the command that is failing
[10:55:10] <gnarf> npm prune fixed it
[10:55:16] <gnarf> i think
[10:56:41] <gnarf> lemme try bumping node

[12:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I meant it worked fine locally. Not sure why it's dying on the server.
[12:21:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: node 0.8
[12:21:26] <gnarf> it worked on 0.10
[12:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> ah
