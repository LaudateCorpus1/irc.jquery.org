[07:04:31] <DaveMethvin> paging infra ... http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1994
[07:04:46] <DaveMethvin> within the last couple of days we started getting errors related to etag tests
[07:04:57] <DaveMethvin> were there any changes to the server config lately?
[09:03:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we updated packages
[09:44:45] <ryanneufeld> that could have enabled them accidentally
[09:58:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: can someone help reduce what the actual error is?
[09:58:56] <DaveMethvin> etag isn't working
[10:04:11] <ryanneufeld> So etags should be enabled and they aren't?
[10:06:11] <gnarf> the e-tags we are using from php currently
[10:06:45] <s5fs> gnarf: hi
[10:06:48] <s5fs> i'm following along
[10:16:50] <jqcommit> 01[13infrastructure01] 15gnarf pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/bd6acbdac0839271d2c5e744c1f34122d6f5dac7
[10:16:50] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-master 14bd6acbd 15Corey Frang: Turn off gzip for etags - apparently if gzip is on, etag is invalidated
[10:18:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^^^ not sure why that fixes it, but i had to turn gzip off to get it not to strip the ETag header
[10:18:33] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[10:18:39] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks, at least it's fixed
[10:20:09] <s5fs> gnarf: super weird, thanks for fixing
[10:20:42] <gnarf> we might be able to use: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGzipModule  -- gzip_proxy no_etag
[10:20:54] <gnarf> but this etag.php location block does that for us
[10:22:01] <s5fs> i'm curious why it decided to start being a piece of crap
[10:22:34] <gnarf> let me see
[10:22:46] <s5fs> gnarf: also, i pushed a changed to puppet-stage last night, please peep it when you get a chance so i can push it to masturrr
[10:23:53] <gnarf> pushed the merge
[10:23:59] <jqcommit> 01[13infrastructure01] 15gnarf pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/872f442b58ac62898acd041a083d47cfd45dd0f3
[10:23:59] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-master 14872f442 15Corey Frang: Merge branch 'puppet-master' into puppet-stage
[10:24:29] <s5fs> whee!
[10:24:48] <gnarf> s5fs: in the future, try to not leave a commit on stage without pulling to master :)
[10:25:12] <s5fs> gnarf: okay, i wasn't suren what the correct procedure was, i didn't wanna just push to master w/o talking to you first
[10:25:33] <s5fs> in the future i'll push what i test and am comfortable with, and will create new branches if i want review. that sound reasonable?
[10:25:39] <gnarf> yup
[10:25:39] <s5fs> i mean, it was a dippy little, easy change.
[10:25:49] <gnarf> exactly, push it to master without review
[10:25:51] <s5fs> gnarf: cool man. just wanting to be sure you set the pace.
[10:26:38] <gnarf> https://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=903
[10:26:57] <gnarf> ^ that issue seems to be the same one we just had
[10:31:17] <s5fs> gnarf: nice find
[10:37:36] <gnarf> hoping to catch one of my co-workers from bocoup who's an nginx guy
[10:38:01] <gnarf> dunno if the timing will work out
[10:48:42] <s5fs> gotcha
[11:23:48] <oconnore> Hello, gnarf 
[11:24:41] <oconnore> calling now
[11:25:08] <oconnore> er... better read first
[11:27:09] <s5fs> oconnore: whats up
[11:28:47] <oconnore> s5fs: Corey sent me this link <https://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=903> and then said to join #jquery-infrastructure.
[11:29:03] <s5fs> oconnore: awesome, so you're the nginx ninja
[11:30:00] <s5fs> oconnore: back story is that we patched hosts last week and now some jenkins job is failing with an etags error.
[11:30:18] <s5fs> lemme gist you corey's solution
[11:30:25] <oconnore> s5fs: k, thanks. 
[11:31:15] <s5fs> oconnore: so here is the interim fix https://gist.github.com/aulvi/05a0a5254a2c1a50eecb
[11:31:45] <s5fs> oconnore: corey also said../
[11:31:47] <s5fs> "gnarf> we might be able to use: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGzipModule  -- gzip_proxy no_etag
[11:32:03] <s5fs> and now I think you're as caught up as I am :)
[11:39:49] <oconnore> s5fs: ok, thanks
[11:45:23] <s5fs> oconnore: anyways, holler if i can be of any help.
[11:45:33] <ryanneufeld> Ditto
[11:46:38] <s5fs> haha, didn't know you were lurking
[11:50:19] <oconnore> s5fs ryanneufeld -- ok, will do. 
[11:52:26] <s5fs> oconnore: so is that enough direction for you? i think we'd appreciate a review of the issue and thoughts on the current fix, like, is there a better way (such as that HttpGzipModule?)
[11:52:49] <s5fs> anyways, i'll return with a sandwich
[11:53:10] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: I'm always lurking http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfJlA4iT-iY
[11:59:35] <oconnore> s5fs ryanneufeld -- Ok, I just got off the phone with Corey. I think the current workaround is acceptable. 
[12:00:21] <oconnore> I think using gzip_proxied: no_etag would be a little bit cleaner, so either Corey or I will test that out
[12:01:10] <oconnore> in general, adding weak ETAG support seams like the next logical step, so we're going to talk more on the Monday after Thanksgiving break
[12:03:50] <oconnore> Also, it seems like nginx is handling ETAGS improperly, (per https://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=903#c4), since the HTTP/1.1 spec is pretty clear that gzip occurs ON the entity, not that the entity is the bytes post gzipping. 
[12:04:06] <oconnore> But that will take more investigation... after I've eaten a bunch of turkey :)
[12:06:07] <oconnore> s5fs ryanneufeld -- if either of you get bored, the ETAG patch that needs to be fixed up per Maxim's guidance is here: http://list-archives.org/2012/11/21/nginx-devel-nginx-org/clearing-etags-when-gzipping/f/1535751350
[12:16:58] <s5fs> oconnore: awesome, thanks for looking into this, you've earned your turkey-day
[12:20:41] <oconnore> s5fs: you're welcome :) thanks! 
[15:00:48] <DaveMethvin> looks like bugs.jquery.com is down gnarf s5fs
[15:18:47] <seancurtis> is http://bugs.jquery.com getting upgraded or something? Been down for a while now...
[15:33:22] <gnarf> trac was stopped, restarted DaveMethvin seancurtis 
[15:33:41] <seancurtis> cool, thanks gnarf
[15:33:45] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf, i needed to be restarted
[15:33:48] <seancurtis> don't you guys get notified when it goes down?
[15:34:15] <seancurtis> it was down when I left work last night (~15 hrs ago)
[15:34:24] <seancurtis> unless it has been up and down again?
[15:34:35] <gnarf> seancurtis - trac is still one of the really old boxes - there isn't a solid monitoring over there yet
[15:34:41] <gnarf> but tbh
[15:34:49] <seancurtis> fair enuff
[15:34:58] <gnarf> alert emails were unlinkely to help in this situation anyway
[15:35:10] <gnarf> unless it really has been down for 15+ hours
[15:35:18] <ryanneufeld> too little too late in this case
[15:35:31] <DaveMethvin> we have so few bugs i hardly ever go to bugs.jquery.com
[15:35:33] <DaveMethvin> HAHAHAHAHA
[15:35:38] <seancurtis> lol
[15:35:47] <gnarf> more improved monitoring/response is on my list
[15:35:53] <DaveMethvin> well thanks for the kick in the pants seancurtis
[15:35:58] <DaveMethvin> just don't file a bug now :)
[15:35:58] <seancurtis> I don't need a bug tracker because I just don't write bugs into my code
[15:36:11] <gnarf> seancurtis: also please - feel free to cc me, s5fs, ryanneufeld on any jquery service outage
[15:36:34] <seancurtis> DaveMethvin: was looking to see when the IE bug with .css("border-left-width'
[15:36:34] <ryanneufeld> I also respond to cookies, and tweets @ryanneufeld
[15:36:36] <gnarf> though i'm on vacation, you guys got lucky i opened up the laptop :)
[15:36:38] <seancurtis> got fixed
[15:36:59] * DaveMethvin prepares gingerbread house for ryanneufeld
[15:37:21] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin <3
[15:37:58] <seancurtis> bah - closed as wontfix
[15:38:13] <ryanneufeld> seancurtis: Take that one up with DaveMethvin
[15:38:36] <seancurtis> well he had the patch for it, John (Resig?) closed it though
[15:39:15] <seancurtis> sucks to do parseInt(0 + $el.css('border-left-width), 10)
[15:39:24] <gnarf> um
[15:39:32] <gnarf> ...
[15:39:32] <ryanneufeld> yeah, especially cause that won't work
[15:39:34] <seancurtis> the comment saying "Just add a border other than medium" isn't a fix - that's UA
[15:39:39] <gnarf> 1) -dev better venue for that
[15:39:52] <DaveMethvin> yep, we've moved from infra to dev
[15:39:52] <ryanneufeld> 2) you missed a single quote
[15:40:04] <DaveMethvin> if gnarf will just take the server back down we'll be back on infra
[15:40:20] <gnarf> i can just break the internet for a thanksgiving present
[15:40:25] <DaveMethvin> yay
[15:40:32] <gnarf> code.jquery.com -> healthcare.gov
[15:40:35] <DaveMethvin> pop stack back to vacation gnarf
[22:05:35] <s5fs> sounds like i missed a fun afternoon
[22:06:39] <s5fs> gnarf: thanks for jumping in and fixing trac. i'll begin working on an upgrade plan during the holiday, i expect to have plenty of time on my hands
