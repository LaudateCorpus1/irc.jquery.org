[15:01:26] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: thanks, we're currently using Saucelabs, and they've not been super stable for us
[15:11:00] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: Aye, yeah. so browserstack is what jquery uses via TestSwarm and has been quite stable over the last few years.
[15:11:16] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: At wikimedia though we use saucelabs for selenium browser tests and they have had issues from time to time.
[15:11:22] <Krinkle> For us as well
[15:11:46] <Krinkle> mostly hearsay though, I don't have a sense of any actual down time or what the issues were.
[15:12:17] <ryanneufeld> can you use browserstack for selenium?
