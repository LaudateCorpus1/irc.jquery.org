[10:36:31] <Krinkle> I've regained access to admin rights on Jenkins doing a sed-i-e find replace on the Jenkins xml configuration database from Krinkle to krinkle.
[10:36:51] <Krinkle> Seems it's case-insensitive when logging in (both work) but user rights are case-sensitive.
[10:37:12] <Krinkle> And when I granted myself those rights 1-2 years ago I was logged in as Krinkle (and it apparently doesn't normalise internally)
