[10:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I tracked down the view.jquerymobile.com bug :-)
[10:36:57] <ryanneufeld> what was it?
[10:37:02] <ryanneufeld> I was looking at that the other day
[10:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools/commit/9c77c32a188bf19ec460d58a060b29940212d84b
[10:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's using an old version of node-git-tools, which occassionally doesn't read the entire stdout stream before invoking the callback :-(
[10:37:40] <ryanneufeld> oh, that's not the same bug :P
[10:38:02] <ryanneufeld> such a subtle change though
[10:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: This is the bug where some of the tags get deleted.
[10:44:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so what version should i include
[10:44:48] <gnarf> cc arschmitz
[10:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> 0.03
[10:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> 0.0.3
[10:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you want to go through the GitHub teams?
[10:48:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we do it next week, i'm at a work week in portland right now
[10:48:19] <gnarf> want to be as focused on gaia as possible
[10:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[14:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> I figured out an API for cloning repos in git-tools that I like :-) https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools#repoclone-options-callback-
[15:26:31] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: nice!
[15:34:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://cl.ly/image/2R2t0Z3n3X3d
[15:49:41] <s5fs> heh
[18:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Well that's not cool.
[18:27:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i'll dig in later tonight
[18:27:33] <gnarf> see if i can solve it
[18:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> ko
[18:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[18:40:58] <jqcommit> 01[13infrastructure01] 15gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-stage: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/f48f8c26d71e10f73263c6884f2dd21f0c858fd6
[18:40:58] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 14f48f8c2 15Corey Frang: making resources/*.php go through php-fpm for real instead of microcache
[18:42:47] <gnarf> i have no idea why
[18:42:54] <jqcommit> 01[13infrastructure01] 15gnarf37 merged 06puppet-stage into 06puppet-master: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/compare/ad9c0dfd54ca...f48f8c26d71e
[18:42:56] <gnarf> but something in the microcache settings was messing with the resources.php on post
[18:43:10] <gnarf> so i just disabled the microcache on resources/*.php
[18:43:13] <gnarf> they are rare anyway
[18:45:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^^
[18:45:19] <gnarf> i have the debug output and it doesn't really make sense
[18:45:24] <gnarf> but the filename was getting truncated 
[18:45:29] <gnarf> so it was actually 404
[18:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[18:45:33] <gnarf> yeah
[18:45:42] <gnarf> something with the temp caching exception fucked it up
[18:45:50] <gnarf> didn't need that for the resources folder anywy
