[04:25:55] <jzaefferer> Krinkle|detached: were there any API changes? Jenkins job is still polling: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%20git%20core/4/console even though its all green: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1413
[04:28:28] <jzaefferer> Krinkle|detached: actually there's one job still in progress, apparently not getting anywhere (Widget-git/Safari 5.1)
[08:33:32] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: No API changes.
[08:39:53] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: yeah, false alarm, sorry 'bout that
[08:40:22] <Krinkle> no problem :)
[08:42:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: can't wait to get proper builds on PRs. you broke QUnit when merging gibson's PR (well only in old IE and only the test suite: trailing comma somewhere). but still, it's a principle :-/ .
[08:42:26] <jzaefferer> yeah, that one sucks
[08:42:30] <Krinkle> as a result it wasn't submitted to testswarm, so now we don't know how it really works in IE.
[08:42:44] <jzaefferer> PR testing will be so nice
[08:42:54] <jzaefferer> I get a little exposure with my validation plugin via travis alreadyt
[08:43:00] <Krinkle> but that doesn't make it right of course to merge without testing :P
[08:43:38] <Krinkle> plain 'grunt' would've caught it. Anyway, simple mistake to make. (it works in Chrome, which everybody uses, right?)
[08:43:39] <jzaefferer> I tested! I just didn't run lint
[08:43:43] <Krinkle> ah, I see.
[08:43:54] <jzaefferer> but still, shame on me
[08:44:08] <Krinkle> j/k on the "not testing" part. I know you'd run the test.
[08:44:11] <Krinkle> btw, what editor are you using?
[08:45:05] <jzaefferer> Sublime Text 2
[08:45:12] <jzaefferer> now to run dialog tests in IE8 m(
[08:45:18] <Krinkle> with SublimeLint installed from Package Control ?
[08:45:28] <jzaefferer> since we dropped IE6, IE8 became the next worse offender
[08:45:38] <jzaefferer> IE7 is so sweet and innocent
[08:45:54] <jzaefferer> IE7 fixed IE6 bugs, IE8 came up with a bunch of new crap
[08:45:59] <Krinkle> https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter
[08:46:02] <Krinkle> it's soo nice.
[08:46:10] <Krinkle> picks up on .jshintrc files as well.
[08:46:41] <Krinkle> the shelling out to node-jshint doesn't work yet (so it has its own copy), but that's OK. It auto-updates via Package Control.
[08:46:45] <jzaefferer> yeah, I've got SublimeLinter
[08:46:48] <Krinkle> k
[08:47:05] <jzaefferer> I use that for linting while editing
[08:47:10] <Krinkle> right
[08:47:17] <Krinkle> but you didn't write this, I get it now.
[08:48:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: one last try, do you see any plausibility in the merging of -infrastructure, ui-dev, mobile-dev back into -dev (irc channels)?
[08:49:26] <jzaefferer> you mean getting rid of all those extra channels and using just one?
[08:50:09] <Krinkle> Yeah. I mean, it could be just me, but I find it very useful to read other people's activities etc. and hanging out together. I mean, topic focus is useful too, but I don't think it is too much noise to merge.
[08:50:28] <Krinkle> all this scattering makes it harder to keep track.
[08:50:39] <Krinkle> Anyhow, don't want to push anything. Just curious how you feel about it.
[08:51:19] <jzaefferer> well, mobile-dev is way too busy to merge that
[08:51:31] <jzaefferer> but content, infrastructure, not so much
[10:18:27] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: these browserstack weirdnesses are freaking me out though
[10:18:37] <Krinkle> such as now, IE10 VMs aren't starting, and have for several hours now.
[12:23:02] <Krinkle> 77 pending runs for IE10 and counting
[12:23:10] * Krinkle spawns one from the GUI
[19:41:11] <gnarf> its not like the content/infra teams aren't also in -dev's and chatting
[19:41:25] <gnarf> i kinda like the separation myself its not like you can't be in all the channels
[19:41:55] <gnarf> also, it's more about where to send the commit / pull notifications
[21:19:06] <ajpiano> the reason it doesn't seem like it's "too much noise" is because there *is* separation
[21:19:33] <ajpiano> there was awhile where ui-dev was like, also the infrastrucutre channel
[21:20:16] <ajpiano> it's really confusing to have conversations about multiple subjects going on at once, and then who is supposed to stop so that the other people can proceed
[21:20:56] <ajpiano> like gnarf says, everyone can be everywhere!
[21:21:10] <ajpiano> so in summary, i also don't see us merging them back Krinkle|detached :)
[21:23:05] <ajpiano> i actually think it helps make it easier for people to participate in multiple conversations at once, when the *people* are the same but the subjects are siloed
[21:23:16] <ajpiano> i know scott_gonzalez has to deal with that a lot :p
[21:26:06] <gnarf> :)
