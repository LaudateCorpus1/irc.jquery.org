[01:47:02] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I've finally read into some Puppet basics, its not complete black magic anymore! Still would appreciate an overview of our own Puppet-based workflow - where do you make a change to test it, how does it get deployed?
[02:15:55] <jzaefferer> Krinkle|detached: woah: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1774
[07:16:01] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: odd, just that one?
[07:16:08] <Krinkle> will look ingo it
[07:16:34] <Krinkle> Its one of jqueryui
[07:16:36] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui
[07:16:42] <Krinkle> since that's the only one I can't open
[07:17:08] <Krinkle> at least the job pages are linked directly from jenkins so you can view the recent stuff.
