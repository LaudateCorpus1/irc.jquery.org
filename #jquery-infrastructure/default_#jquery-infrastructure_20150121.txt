[11:50:50] <arthurvr> We donâ€™t do infrastructure meetings anymore right?
[11:50:58] <arthurvr>  Just asking because the meetings site still says we do.
[12:53:32] <ryanneufeld> arthurvr: they're more ad-hoc
[12:53:48] <ryanneufeld> if you want to be kept in the loop, ping s5fs he'll keep you up to date on when meetings
[12:55:05] <arthurvr> np ;) I was just wondering.
[22:16:17] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: we still try to meet every thursday at 5p PST on hangouts
[22:16:26] <s5fs> but yes, it's way more ad-hoc
