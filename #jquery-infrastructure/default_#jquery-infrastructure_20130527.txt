[11:01:42] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: are you making it up to portland this coming month for the conf? I'm excited to meet everyone.
[12:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: Yup, I'll be there :-)
[12:41:36] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: awesome!
[17:07:09] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: okay so i've got a little script to yoink relevant github data using their api. i'd like to extend the pluginsdb.plugins table and add a 'etag' field, which we can use in api calls. 304s don't count against our hourly limit, so if we can keep track of the etag we can update wp more quickly/effectively. thoughts?
