[08:11:20] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: long pong
[10:07:26] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: is there any reason we need nginx on citadel?
[10:07:36] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i think it's running apache?
[10:07:42] <ryanneufeld> nope
[10:07:47] <gnarf> so the opposite is probably true?
[10:07:57] <gnarf> the zabbix server is hosted
[10:08:21] <ryanneufeld> root@citadel:~# /etc/init.d/nginx status
[10:08:22] <ryanneufeld> nginx is running.
[10:08:35] <ryanneufeld> root@citadel:~# /etc/init.d/apache2 status
[10:08:35] <ryanneufeld> Apache2 is running (pid 555).
[10:08:38] <ryanneufeld> wtf
[10:10:04] <ryanneufeld> nginx is only serving the default page
[10:10:27] <ryanneufeld> apache is for zabbiz
[10:10:31] <ryanneufeld> zabbix
[10:13:16] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: gnarf, I've disabled the default apache host, and turned off nginx for now. Since we don't need both running.
