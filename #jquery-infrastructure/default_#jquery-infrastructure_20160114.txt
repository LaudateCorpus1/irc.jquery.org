[13:37:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: when are you free tonight, lets plan this
[13:37:39] <gnarf> or when do you want to do this
[13:38:04] <gnarf> i'm pretty open save for 11am daily, 1:30p friday meetings
[13:38:36] <gnarf> though the closer to after 8 or 9pm we get the more likely I am to already have gone into computer shutdown mode
[14:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Maybe in an hour or so?
[14:42:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe!
[14:42:44] <gnarf> (prolly yes for me)
[14:43:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm pairing with someone right now. So I'll ping you whenever this is over.
[16:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is now good?
[16:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've got half an hour.
[16:33:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sure
