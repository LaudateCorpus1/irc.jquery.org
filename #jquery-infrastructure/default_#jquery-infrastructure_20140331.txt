[05:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: Thanks. We actually had someone complain about that error again.
[08:08:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: inability to post? shouldn't happen to a logged in user
[08:09:31] <gnarf> also scott_gonzalez : http://bugs.jqueryui.com/admin/spamfilter/monitor
[08:09:34] <gnarf> shows you "reasons"
[08:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9954
[08:14:14] <gnarf> hrm
[09:17:04] <m_gol> gnarf: the graph has shut down: http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/history.php?action=showgraph&itemid=23742&sid=819b307e36f1ca6d
[09:17:18] <m_gol> gnarf: 4 days ago
[09:19:08] <gnarf> oh, host change
[09:19:30] <gnarf> forgot to update the IP's in zabbix from the host change s5fs - if you beat me to it
[09:25:29] <s5fs> gnarf: yeah i've been watchign the emails but haven't taken action, will prob do so today
[09:25:51] <gnarf> m_gol: thanks for the heads up
[09:26:17] <gnarf> m_gol: we kinda moved everything in a rush - forgot to update the monitoring server's IPs (it uses IP instead of name)
[09:26:32] <gnarf> though we should prolly rename that host to jq0x in zabbix too
[09:26:36] <gnarf> cc s5fs 
[09:27:01] <s5fs> gnarf: ugh, so i just gotta replace IPs with hostnames? no prob.
[09:27:28] <gnarf> s5fs: it has both in the config - i think we should keep it IP based for polling tho
[09:27:39] <gnarf> we just need to remember to update zabbix when we move a host ;)
[09:28:07] <gnarf> but since the actual "host" is now jq0x - not jenkis.
[09:28:24] <gnarf> we should prolly rename the hosts too (also super easy, and on the same screen as the IP)
[09:28:48] <s5fs> okay I'll bang that change out later today
