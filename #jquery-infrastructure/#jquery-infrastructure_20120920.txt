[18:45:46] <ryanneufeld> make sure that you have the DEFAULT ACCEPT
[18:45:50] <ryanneufeld> or you might get locked out
[18:46:11] <ryanneufeld> what server is this? gnarf do I have access? I might be able to help
[18:46:12] <gnarf> danheberden and I had chatted briefly about a jquery znc
[18:46:13] <clarkbox> THIS CHANNEL IS NOW BEING LOGGED!
[18:46:24] <Krinkle> clarkbox: what else is znc being used for?
[18:46:30] <clarkbox> i got it ryanneufeld
[18:46:32] <gnarf> but dunno if we ever made that call Krinkle
[18:46:45] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: nice
[18:46:47] <Krinkle> oh, I get it, jqlog
[18:46:55] <gnarf> i think we could do it for people who don't want to set it up themselves, but i'll dbl check with danheberden
[18:47:20] <clarkbox> we just use ZNC to log krinkle
[18:47:36] <Krinkle> we can probably share a znc instance and let people login. people would have shell access to it anyway, so it wouldn't really make sense to set up different znc instances. user preferences are per user inside znc iirc
[18:47:44] <Krinkle> clarkbox: to log me?
[18:47:46] <Krinkle> :P
[18:47:51] <clarkbox> yes!
[18:48:50] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah, kinda what I meant, but like there are a few issues with it
[18:48:53] <gnarf> #1
[18:49:01] <gnarf> ZNC actually kinda needs your nickserv pass
[18:49:04] <gnarf> in plaintext
[18:49:17] <gnarf> so you gotta trust jQuery sysadmins with your plaintext nick pass
[18:49:47] <Krinkle> right, it stores the znc webadmin pass as a hash, but the nickserv plugin/module does not.
[18:50:04] <gnarf> best way is to setup IRC serve password
[18:50:26] <gnarf> nick:pass as a server password auths you wihthout nickserv
[18:50:28] <Krinkle> it could/would run as a certain user, so only roots would have access to that plain text file, but yeah, not very secure.
[18:50:35] <Krinkle> hm.. interesting.
[18:50:42] <Krinkle> 've never used that
[18:50:47] <Krinkle> does that work on freenode?
[18:50:49] <gnarf> Krinkle: yup
[18:51:04] <gnarf> Krinkle: that way you don't even need the nickserv module :)
[18:51:27] <Krinkle> right
[18:51:28] <Krinkle> and znc doesn't store that as plaintext I suppose?
[18:51:36] <Krinkle> I wonder how
[18:51:40] <gnarf> I'd make sure that the server stuff was setup on ssl too
[18:51:50] <gnarf> Krinkle: actually, you have to store the server pass plaintext too
[18:52:00] <Krinkle> so that doesn't really make a difference then
[18:52:02] <gnarf> like i said, need to trust jquery roots with your nick pass
[18:52:16] <gnarf> but - no module, and it also lets you join private channels immediately
[18:52:27] <gnarf> without having to nickserv auth first
[18:52:29] <Krinkle> its a default module, not really a burdon
[18:52:41] <gnarf> the second part is important
[18:52:42] <Krinkle> btw, I'm not sure its required to store the pass in znc
[18:52:56] <Krinkle> you can let it only connect to the server and enter it from the client
[18:53:00] <gnarf> cuz when ZNC bounces, like if an IRC server splits or whatever
[18:53:12] <gnarf> it rejoins channels
[18:53:18] <Krinkle> it does mean that if znc server gets restarted when you're not there, it won't be able to auth.
[18:53:30] <Krinkle> but it does allow one to use znc to stay online, for as long as the server stays online
[18:53:34] <gnarf> so if you aren't authed on startup, you get into those chans immediately
[18:53:47] <gnarf> can't ^
[18:53:58] <Krinkle> most clients (afaik incl. znc) make sure that nickserv gets around before joining channels anyway
[18:59:10] <clarkbox> whats up with this server gnarf? is it getting migrated/pupetized anytime soon?
[18:59:18] <clarkbox> (services)
[19:09:36] <gnarf> clarkbox: whats left there?
[19:09:40] <gnarf> we could start to move stuff
[19:10:35] <gnarf> clarkbox: can you do a quick inventory on it, post an issue on the stuff that needs to move, I'll check DNS on that machine too
[19:10:55] <gnarf> there may already be one
[19:10:58] <gnarf> but im out the door
