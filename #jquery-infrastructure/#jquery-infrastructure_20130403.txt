[09:38:30] <Krinkle> !splunk
[09:56:29] <ryanneufeld> !splunk?
[09:56:37] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox?
[10:06:14] <Krinkle> No, I forgot the url (.com or .org :8080 or :8000)
[10:06:21] <Krinkle> I recall thee being a bot command but apparently no
[10:06:24] <Krinkle> Got it already
[10:12:14] <ryanneufeld> ah
[10:12:17] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf
[10:12:39] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: here too
[10:14:28] <Krinkle> gnarf: When were you planning on moving jenkins?
[10:14:42] <Krinkle> btw, does it mean re-installing or can you actually move it?
[10:15:00] <gnarf> Krinkle: we can probably move all the data over and skip any "installing"
[10:15:08] <gnarf> but we will need to edit jobs to change scp locations etc
[10:15:42] <gnarf> Krinkle: i was hoping to setup the box, and install software/start the move tonight
[10:16:02] <gnarf> but i'm super busy for the next 3 or 4 hours
[10:16:19] <Krinkle> gnarf: I'm not sure you answered (I disconnected before I could read it), but what about the url/port that is public facing
[10:16:22] <Krinkle> swarm:8080
[10:17:07] <gnarf> we could proxy it, but I'm kind of thinking about getting it on just jenkins.jquery.com
[10:17:16] <Krinkle> Sure
[10:17:34] <Krinkle> I can set up a redirect on jq03
[10:18:12] <Krinkle> gnarf: jq03 did its crash thingy again just now
[10:18:16] <Krinkle> Gateway errors
[10:18:22] <Krinkle> This time no Jenkins jobs were running
[10:18:43] <Krinkle> it was right after browserstack fixed a bug on their end when clients started joining the swarm again
[10:19:02] <Krinkle> could be a coincedence, but I'd say something that is indirectly via http requests causes it 
[10:19:17] <gnarf> hrm
[10:19:32] <Krinkle> nginx, php-fpm, mysql, who knows
[10:19:34] <gnarf> was there a large number of requests/sec there?
[10:19:46] <Krinkle> define large
[10:20:13] <Krinkle> 10 browsers go to swarm/run
[10:20:20] <Krinkle> and make an ajax ping every 30 seconds
[10:20:25] <gnarf> an order of magnitude higher than the previous minute?
[10:20:35] <Krinkle> they load css/html/js from swarm/git/buid/sha1/*
[10:20:54] <Krinkle> gnarf: the 2 hours before there were ~ 0 requests as the swarm was idle 
[10:21:01] <gnarf> so files like that aren't really going to ever be "slow"
[10:21:02] <Krinkle> browserstack api was doen
[10:21:03] <Krinkle> down*
[10:21:15] <gnarf> css/html/js are just served fast
[10:21:23] <gnarf> but they do read from the filesystem
[10:22:02] <Krinkle> So it's either the static files from swarm.jquery.org/build or the php/mysql from swarm.jquery.org/run/ or swarm.jquery.org/api.php?action=ping
[10:22:15] <Krinkle> that is. assuming it wasn't a coincedence
[10:22:22] <Krinkle> coincidence*
[10:23:05] <Krinkle> But those pages by themselves never cause a crash, if it is connected to this, it has to be a certain amount at once.
[10:23:34] <Krinkle> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/php_errors
[10:23:46] <Krinkle> ANyhow, you were busy. This can wait :)
[10:25:27] <Krinkle> I'm fixing those notices/warnings now, must be a recent regression, though nothing urgent
[10:31:56] <gnarf> well, the next thing on my list today will be infrastructure meeting
[10:31:57] <gnarf> :)
[10:34:15] <gnarf> which is always quite boring
[10:45:58] <Krinkle> LOL
[10:46:00] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/98/console
[10:46:08] <Krinkle> Cleaning up outdated copies
[10:46:08] <Krinkle> rm: cannot remove directory: `.'
[10:46:18] <Krinkle> The directory the builds are outputted to is included in the list
[10:46:35] <Krinkle> usually not a problem, but if there are no new builds for 30 days, that means the parent directory is matches as last updated > 30 days ago
[10:46:36] <Krinkle> xD
[10:46:53] <Krinkle> matched*
[10:47:39] <Krinkle> > find . -maxdepth 1 -ctime +14 | grep -v master | xargs rm -rf
[10:50:12] <Krinkle> Changing to  grep -v -P '^(master|\.)$'

[13:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Where are the templates for trac?
[13:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the Trac installs aren't managed by puppet yet.
[13:41:30] <gnarf> no they aren't
[13:41:38] <gnarf> they are just files on the server
[13:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know the path?
[13:41:47] <gnarf> no
[13:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok
[13:41:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do some searching.
[13:41:58] <gnarf> cc mikesherov?
[13:42:09] <mikesherov> hi
[13:42:17] <gnarf> probably in the folders that have trac installed somewhere
[13:42:22] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: use find
[13:42:29] <gnarf> the bugs.jqueryui.com / bugs.jquery.com
[13:42:34] <mikesherov> gnarf found them using fine at the dev summit
[13:42:42] <mikesherov> using find*
[13:42:50] <mikesherov> find ticketgraph
[13:42:55] <mikesherov> you'll see where the templates are
[13:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> hmm... `ssh bugs.jquery.com` is asking for a password.
[13:43:11] <gnarf> thats still a jqadmin@ machine i think
[13:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...that's also prompting me for a password.
[13:44:08] <gnarf> prolly using your old key there
[13:44:12] <gnarf> pm me the new one again?
[13:44:16] <gnarf> ill add you quick
[13:44:41] <gnarf> actually nevermind
[13:44:48] <gnarf> this machine is all sorts of weird old setup
[13:45:06] <gnarf> but yeah
[13:45:09] <gnarf> there is a jqadmin account
[13:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If you're on the machine already, maybe you can just do this for me.
[13:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> I was just going to change the download link in the footer.
[13:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, actually, every link in the footer.
[13:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> haha Copyright 2010 John Resig.
[13:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> what a mess
[13:46:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: try jqadmin@
[13:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> yay, it works now
[13:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[14:24:29] <ryanneufeld> ping clarkbox
[15:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> For future reference (assuming someone can remember this or writes it down): /var/www/bugs.jquery.com/private/templates
[15:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually in a sane location.
