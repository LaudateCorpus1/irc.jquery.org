[09:02:57] <ryanneufeld> @m_gol I am now
[09:03:17] <m_gol> ryanneufeld: we've got it sorted out with s5fs_ :)
[09:03:25] <ryanneufeld> ok
[10:16:03] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld s5fs_ gnarf: I've tagged and push jquery-license 1.0.0, got checked out and installed properly, it ran `/etc/init.d/jquery-license reload`, but now the server isn't up
[10:16:33] <jzaefferer> Calling the init.d script manually also just says its okay, going to `/var/www/jquery-license` and running `npm start` works fine, too
[10:16:47] <jzaefferer> yet nothing responds on http://cla-01.ops.jquery.net:3100/
[10:25:28] <jzaefferer> m_gol maybe?
[10:27:06] <m_gol> jzaefferer: this URL is supposed to be non-public...
[10:27:11] <m_gol> anything under that domain :(
[10:27:36] <m_gol> jzaefferer: read the note at the top of https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm
[10:28:34] <m_gol> I didn't play with the CLA service yet so I'm afraid I can't help currently
[10:28:57] <jzaefferer> well, thanks for pointing out that silly mistake
[10:31:05] <jzaefferer> I have no idea how to delete the line from irc.jquery.org logs
[10:47:02] <gnarf> jzaefferer: It's pretty much impossible to undo - we can just hope it goes forgotten
[10:48:10] <gnarf> ✓ root@cla-01:~# /etc/init.d/jquery-license stop
[10:48:10] <gnarf> [ ok ] Stopping jquery-license 3100: jquery-license.
[10:48:10] <gnarf> ✓ root@cla-01:~# /etc/init.d/jquery-license start
[10:48:10] <gnarf> [ ok ] Starting jquery-license 3100: jquery-license.
[10:49:02] <gnarf> the service seems up to me
[10:49:06] <gnarf> I can hit it at :3100
[10:49:47] <gnarf> My GET gives me a 400 Bad Request -- which i expect because it wasn't a github hooks
[10:50:49] <gnarf> Github shows me a green checkmark for a deploy to the webhook
[11:09:02] <jzaefferer> looks fine now. So why didn't the restart work?
[11:09:14] <jzaefferer> Guess I'll try explicit stop/start the next time
[11:09:55] <jzaefferer> Why is there even a restart command when stop/start works fine/better...
[15:16:43] <s5fs_> jzaefferer: sorry i'm late to the party, glad you got things working
[15:25:51] <jzaefferer> s5fs: well, Corey tried turning it off and on again, and that worked! Silly me, trying a restart /o\
[15:26:14] <jzaefferer> and the next deploy, fixing a regression I introduced, went through without any issues
[15:26:22] <s5fs> good deal
[15:26:45] <s5fs> while we're on the topic, after I patch the cla server, how should I go about testing it?
