[08:54:45] <s5fs> gnarf: thoughts on splitting some services off of jq01?
[08:54:53] <gnarf> s5fs: like?
[08:55:10] <gnarf> s5fs: where to?
[08:55:11] <s5fs> stand up another wp instance and roll smaller properties onto it
[08:55:22] <s5fs> yeah, the "where" is a legit question
[08:55:52] <s5fs> the perpetual high utilization is leading to zabbix false positives, kinda
[08:56:02] <gnarf> s5fs: also "part of the plan"
[08:56:03] <s5fs> but it did take forever for me to ssh in this morning
[08:56:19] <gnarf> is the load running hot again?
[08:56:35] <s5fs> its okay now, around 45% cpu fairly peppy
[08:56:48] <s5fs> but its consistently loaded for sure
[08:57:10] <s5fs> anyways just thinking out loud :)
[08:57:24] <gnarf> so
[08:57:35] <gnarf> out loud thinking, got time to hangouts a minute?
[08:57:53] <s5fs> nope, gotta run to puppet camp, registration opens in 3min
[08:58:16] <s5fs> full day event
[08:58:29] <gnarf> k
[08:58:36] <gnarf> i have a possible load solver
[08:58:43] <s5fs> oh nice
[08:59:43] <s5fs> i closed out my last sprint and am in the process of reorging my schedule to accomodate my new responsibilities
[09:00:11] <s5fs> i'm thinking i'll work friday and half of saturday on jq stuff (since we do hangouts saturdays already)
[09:01:38] <s5fs> ok gtg, later!
[09:01:44] <gnarf> s5fs: my solution involves reducing this: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20sourcetype%3D%22access_combined%22%20%22cache%3A0%2C0%22%20status%3E300&earliest=-4h%40m&latest=now
[09:02:12] <gnarf> those are requests going through php that result in errors

[10:55:02] <gnarf> i killed nginx for like 10 seconds
[10:55:04] <s5fs> that's double plus ungood
[10:55:07] <gnarf> and everything ran perfect
[10:55:11] <gnarf> yeah
[10:55:46] <s5fs> which site is most of this traffic heading for?
[10:56:47] <s5fs> puppet camp is cool btw
[10:57:21] <gnarf> s5fs: hard to say
[10:57:31] <gnarf> most likely api 
[10:57:49] <s5fs> i'm just wondering what we could bump to another host real quick, shed some load
[10:58:02] <gnarf> yeah
[10:58:12] <gnarf> i'm going to evaluate that
[10:58:45] <s5fs> okay i'm interested to hear what you find. i wish i was free to wonk on this today.
[10:59:16] <s5fs> back to the conf, i'll check in after a while. thanks for being on top of this, i really apprecaite it.
[11:15:23] <gnarf> well
[11:15:32] <gnarf> we hit network limit before we melted the cpu

[12:28:01] <gnarf> kborchers: ping
[12:28:04] <gnarf> think i found the leak
[12:28:15] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/jquery -> http://codeorigin.jquery.com/jquery/
[12:28:35] <kborchers> ah
[12:29:25] <kborchers> gnarf: you think you can put in a redirect like you were talking about?
[12:29:32] <gnarf> kborchers: i dunno
[12:29:38] <gnarf> kborchers: playing with nginx right now
[12:29:45] <kborchers> ok
[12:29:49] <gnarf> trying to figure out if i can match based on ips 
[12:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If we have ?view can't we just use that instead of whitelisting?
[12:46:48] <gnarf> because we can't force maxcdn to add that to every request?
[12:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling ?view won't work as well as you want.
[12:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> Because it won't get passed to any of the resources, like CSS files.
[12:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> But it'll work for testing individual files that would be served by the CDN.
[12:48:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure when we'd need to test that though.
[12:51:12] <gnarf> so 
[12:51:26] <gnarf>  /jquery-wp-content and /xmlrpc.php are going to be whitelisted
[12:51:31] <gnarf> so anyone can hit those
[13:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[14:42:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin gseguin arschmitz scott_gonzalez jzaefferer Krinkle|detached : FYI - to view a file on codeorigin.jquery.com you now need to attach ?view 
[14:42:14] <DaveMethvin> so disappointed you have no time machine gnarf
[14:42:16] <gnarf> but this cut the network traffic in half easily
[14:42:31] <gseguin> thanks for the heads DaveMethvin
[14:42:38] <gseguin> *heads up
[14:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin is giving out heads?
[14:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> 2 heads are better than 1...unless it's 2 DaveMethvin heads :-P

[14:43:43] <gnarf> for those of you that can see it
[14:44:15] <gseguin> I knew that wouldn't go unnoticed :D
[14:44:51] <ryanneufeld> nice, finally not having php parse things that aren't php?
[14:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: That was fixed a while ago.
[14:45:21] <ryanneufeld> oh
[14:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> This is preventing people from using codeorigin.jquery.com as a CDN.
[14:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> The PHP change also had a similar graph though :-)
[14:45:54] <ryanneufeld> ah
[14:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was even more of a drop though for PHP.
[14:46:07] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/231
[14:46:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that was a load drop
[14:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's a pretty graph :-)
[14:48:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: php was load drop - this was traffic drop
[14:48:11] <gnarf> probably also load drop
[14:49:54] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/3t0o121D1917 -- traffic drop per minute
[14:53:07] <gnarf> codeorigin is a frickin puzzle of an nginx config now though
[14:53:39] <gnarf> actually almost no load drop from this change, since it was just "push a file" requests
[14:54:42] <jzaefferer> gnarf: so CDN git builds from jenkins should be working fine now?
[14:54:59] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yes
[15:22:23] <gnarf> part of me wants to change ?view
[15:22:25] <gnarf> to be
[15:22:29] <gnarf> ?not-for-production

[15:55:46] <gnarf> so codeorigin.jquery.com is now one of the smaller bandwidth sites ;)
[15:56:57] <s5fs> whew!
[15:57:10] <s5fs> so when did this start?
[15:57:22] <s5fs> felt like a firehose was turned on us
[15:58:15] <s5fs> omg wifi is so slow here, i'm dying inside
[16:10:47] <gnarf> s5fs: it's been building
[16:10:54] <gnarf> but over the last week much more
[16:11:05] <gnarf> i'm pulling a longer term chart out of splunk
[16:11:55] <gnarf> its been >500gig per day since saturday though :)
[16:12:43] <gnarf> we should probably set a zabbix alert for out > 7meg/sec
