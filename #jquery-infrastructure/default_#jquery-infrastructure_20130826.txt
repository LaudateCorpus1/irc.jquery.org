[10:48:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so interesting note on github ticket graphs ducksboard sent me an email asking for feedback so i told them what we were looking for and that their current solution did not work for us and they apparently are going to look into adding this.
[10:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[10:49:40] <arschmitz> yeah who knows when or if it will happen but you never know
[10:50:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: if they add it maybe they will even hook it up with a free account :)
[10:54:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was thinking about contacting them to discuss what we're looking for and whether they'd donate an account.
[10:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> Did you mention that you're on the team?
[10:59:13] <arschmitz> yes
[10:59:34] <arschmitz> probably why they responded that they would look into it in under 5 minutes
[10:59:41] <arschmitz> :)
[11:00:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: if you have any intrest i can cc you
[11:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> For now just keep me updated.
[11:01:26] <arschmitz> will do
[11:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
