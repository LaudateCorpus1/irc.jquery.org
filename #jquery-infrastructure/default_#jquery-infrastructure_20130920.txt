[11:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> Turns out they're doing a beta on Monday, not a final release.
[11:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> So we're not ready to do the API site transition.
[11:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I forgot what we discussed in Austin about changing how the API sites work. Let's discuss that early next week.
[11:36:25] <s5fs> i'd love to listen in
[12:02:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez alrighty
[12:02:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez well all the pieces are there yeah?
[12:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> They will be.
[12:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> I just need to add the jquery-wp-entry.
