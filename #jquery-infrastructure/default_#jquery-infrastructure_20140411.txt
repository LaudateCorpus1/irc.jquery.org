[17:37:25] <s5fs> gnarf: ping
[17:37:33] <gnarf> s5fs: pong.5
[17:37:51] <s5fs> gnarf: just patched jenkins, looks like stuff fails now. could you take a look with me?
[17:37:56] <gnarf> (having last minute freakouts while writing slides - bandwidth limited)
[17:38:06] <s5fs> oh fun!
[17:38:08] <s5fs> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Color/118/console
[17:38:36] <gnarf> seems that problem might be coming from swarm 
[17:38:39] <gnarf> which is not jenkins
[17:38:50] <gnarf> browserstack might be down
[17:39:09] <gnarf> or the process that spawns browsers might be down (check crontab on swarm)
[17:39:31] <s5fs> crontab for which user?
[17:49:49] <s5fs> gnarf: n/m i found it. nothing in the logs, all seems okay?
[17:53:01] <s5fs> yeah reran just fine, thx
