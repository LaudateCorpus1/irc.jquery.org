[17:03:37] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: hi
[17:03:51] <ryanneufeld> have you tried to stand up jq01.stage locally recently?
[17:03:58] <ryanneufeld> it seems to be having some trouble on mine
[17:04:11] <s5fs> lemme give it a try, 1sec
[17:05:17] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i'm bringing it up now, could take a bit :D
[17:05:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:05:41] <s5fs> what sort of issue are you having? where in the process is it pooping out?
