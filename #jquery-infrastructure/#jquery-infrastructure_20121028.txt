[14:43:07] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: lets chat here about that
[14:43:23] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: aye
[14:43:34] <ryanneufeld> so heres the thing
[14:43:46] <ryanneufeld> you can disavow sites in the webmasters kit
[14:43:59] <ryanneufeld> but nothing you do to the page with JS will effect their index
[14:44:18] <danheberden> ok
[14:44:22] <ryanneufeld> they mainly look for hidden content
[14:44:35] <ryanneufeld> now, if you wanted to get malicous
[14:44:50] <danheberden> (kind of)
[14:44:51] <ryanneufeld> you might be able to mess with their analytics
[14:45:11] <danheberden> how's that?
[14:45:34] <danheberden> i mean, i am now, since users will get rdirected before ga.js parses
[14:46:03] <ryanneufeld> is it an exact clone?
[14:46:10] <ryanneufeld> or are they using their own analytics
[14:46:11] <ryanneufeld> ?
[14:46:21] <danheberden> hmm, good question
[14:47:00] <danheberden> haha
[14:47:02] <danheberden> exact clone
[14:47:07] <danheberden> same UA
[14:47:14] <danheberden> UA-1076265-1
[14:47:27] <ryanneufeld> ok
[14:47:30] <danheberden> i almost think they were tying to be nice
[14:47:37] <danheberden> but for some reason, just aren't responding to take down requests
[14:47:40] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, can you contact them?
[14:47:42] <ryanneufeld> ah
[14:47:43] <danheberden> cuz it *is* just a mirror
[14:47:54] <ryanneufeld> contact their hosting provider with a DMCA
[14:48:31] <danheberden> our lawyer did some stuff
[14:48:36] <danheberden> or IS doing
[14:48:43] <danheberden> but we figured might as well help our users in the meantime
[14:49:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:49:23] <ryanneufeld> I think the redirect for now is a good call
[14:54:09] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: the other option is a confirm() box that redirects
[14:54:23] <ryanneufeld> so, like, the user knows
[15:15:49] <danheberden> i think, for the most part, users won't care or it'll be too much to explain
[15:15:59] <danheberden> that they clicked a google link and it's somehow not what they want
[15:21:41] <ryanneufeld> yeah
