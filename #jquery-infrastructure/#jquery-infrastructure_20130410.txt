[07:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Why would `git pull` prompt me for a username?
[07:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm SSHed into blog.jqueryui.com.
[07:43:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: because it's using https for the remote instead of git@ maybe?
[07:43:19] <gnarf> which actually, is probably better anyway
[07:43:27] <gnarf> because then you can use your own u/p ?
[07:43:33] <gnarf> if you push
[07:43:41] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but this is just a pull.
[07:43:44] <gnarf> i think you can skip the username if its a public repo
[07:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> So why does it care?
[07:43:47] <gnarf> just hit enter
[07:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> fatal: Authentication failed
[07:44:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what repo?
[07:44:11] <gnarf> git remote -v ?
[07:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> origin	https://github.com/jquery/blog.jqueryui.com-theme.git (fetch)
[07:44:33] <gnarf> thats a 404?
[07:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...wait, maybe this is a messed up checkout.
[07:44:54] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com-theme isn't
[07:45:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think it assumes that there might be a private repo if it 404's trying to load it from public
[07:45:21] <gnarf> so it asks for the u/p
[07:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> I got it.
[07:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently wp-content is a checkout of the old repo.
[07:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> And wp-content/themes is a checkout of the new repo.
[07:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why I did that.
[07:46:13] <gnarf> you should just delete the "origin" remote
[07:46:24] <gnarf> so it's more explicit about not being a real repo or somethin
[07:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> I can just delete the .git dir.
[10:42:48] <gnarf> sure
