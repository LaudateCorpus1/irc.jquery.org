[07:49:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any chance you've updated the github post receive hooks script to take application/json?
[07:49:36] <scott_gonzalez> For node-git-notifier or for plugins.jquery.com?
[08:13:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: node-git-notifier and/or plugins.jquery.com ?
[08:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> Neither does, but it shoul be pretty easy to add.

[10:45:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you bump that up a bit, its the default on github webhooks now
[10:46:08] <gnarf> just noticed this
[10:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: sure
[10:46:18] <gnarf> or can you point me at what needs to be updated? :)
[10:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, which do you want to update first?
[10:46:50] <gnarf> node-git-notifier 
[10:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-notifier/blob/master/notifier.js#L15
[10:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> Should be a very simple change.
[10:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> Just check the content type and determine how to parse it.
[11:15:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you have a script that you use to test this thing? :)
[11:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check.
[11:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, no ignore directory in my local checkout.
[11:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think I probably just had a script that did posts.
[11:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> Like the plugins test script.
[11:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> You can use requestb.in to capture a real hook and use that to rebuild it locally.
[11:40:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-notifier/pulls ?
[11:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: There's no data.payload for JSON, is there?
[11:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> The data is just the raw JSON.
[12:00:48] <gnarf> yup
[12:00:53] <gnarf> oh shit
[12:00:57] <gnarf> i thought i had that working
[12:01:01] <gnarf> i did
[12:01:04] <gnarf> then i changed it
[12:01:04] <gnarf> sorry
[12:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[12:02:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: pushed ammended
[12:02:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we do anything with "X-GitHub-Delivery: a694391e-ecf5-11e3-984b-cdbd58851b22" ?
