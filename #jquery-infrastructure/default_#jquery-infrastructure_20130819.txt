[09:28:05] <_orkel> any ideas?
[09:32:03] <gnarf> not really - the runtoken i can give to you guys so you can see whats happening
[09:33:04] <gnarf> though i don't know where it is stored
[09:33:21] <gnarf> i assumed it would be in the localsettings.json
[09:37:00] <_orkel> mmm, Krinkle might know about it?
[09:37:20] <gnarf> sent you a link to the runtoken in pm

[11:59:33] <s5fs> danheberden: ping!
[12:01:08] <s5fs> danheberden: I'm thinking about getting rid of proxy-01.stage.jquery.net and www-02.jquery.net. Any concerns?
[12:15:58] <gnarf> danheberden: i don't even think i have credentials to log into www-02 - so whatever it is, it's very very old news
[12:15:58] <gnarf> :)
[12:16:17] <gnarf> also these are the machines spamming our inboxes the most at the moment (i think)
[13:09:47] <danheberden> gnarf s5fs i don't even remember what www-02 was for
[13:09:55] <gnarf> BOOM
[13:09:57] <s5fs> danheberden: haha!
[13:10:30] <danheberden> hmm, we had learn.jquery.com on it
[13:10:34] <danheberden> it looks like
[13:10:39] <danheberden> or i planned on it
[13:10:46] <danheberden> i must have already cleaned it
[13:11:02] <danheberden> and yeah, proxy is dead so happy to see them go
[13:11:15] <s5fs> danheberden: I don't see anything else pointed to that host (www-02)
[13:11:37] <s5fs> danheberden: okay cool, so I have your blessing to blow those two hosts away?
[13:12:01] <danheberden> well it's gnarf's blessing that you need, but yes of course!
[13:13:37] <danheberden> also s5fs i saw someone trying to look as dapper as you on tv
[13:13:40] <s5fs> danheberden: heh, i try to keep pdx in the loop first, let boston handle their own biz ;-)
[13:13:52] <s5fs> danheberden: haha, was he selling lucky charms?
[13:14:00] <danheberden> haha no
[13:14:00] <danheberden> 
[13:14:03] <danheberden> hmm, pasting
[13:14:13] <danheberden> (is on irssi on a chromebook because his mbp died)
[13:14:21] <danheberden> http://madmen.wikia.com/wiki/Adam_Whitman
[13:14:23] <danheberden> there we go
[13:14:59] <s5fs> man he's got a great shirt on
[13:15:17] <s5fs> http://plasmapool.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Adam-Whitman-and-Don-Draper.jpg
[13:15:41] <s5fs> gnarf: okay so Dan is cool with me dropping those hosts. do I just submit a ticket and let nature take it's course?
[13:15:53] <s5fs> I don't plan to back anything up.
[13:16:32] <s5fs> danheberden: do you attend local meetups or anything? i tend to run with the pdxnode crew mostly but it would be fun to hang w/you again sometime.
[13:17:48] <gnarf> s5fs: yup
[13:18:23] <danheberden> s5fs i haven't, but wouldn't mind doing that
[13:18:39] <danheberden> the pdxjs one wasn't that great, so i kinda stopped with it all
[13:38:14] <s5fs> danheberden: the js admirers group is cool but i'm not as close with them (yet). i hear you on sub-par meetups, they can be demotivating for sure
[13:49:01] <s5fs> gnarf: okay tickets have been submitted, one per host. thanks for your help!
[13:52:08] <gnarf> s5fs: after they remove the server, kill the dns pointing at it
[13:52:28] <s5fs> gnarf: will do, I'll even update the wiki
