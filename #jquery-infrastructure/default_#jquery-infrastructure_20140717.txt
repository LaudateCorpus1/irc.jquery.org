[07:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden gnarf ryanneufeld s5fs: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/manifests/wp/jqueryui.pp#L24 isn't working
[07:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4329
[07:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh
[07:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> That's probably my local setup. Nevermind.
[07:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I have dev.* entries in my hosts file
[08:32:28] <ryanneufeld> PICNIC? scott_gonzalez
[08:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[08:32:49] <ryanneufeld> Problem In Chair Not In Computer
[08:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> I've only heard of PEBKAC
[08:33:25] <ryanneufeld> yeah, this one is easier to slip past the end lusers
[08:33:26] <ryanneufeld> :p
[09:00:28] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: how've you been man?
[09:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> Good, finally getting back in shape :-)
[09:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> Though getting older may be taking a toll on me. I had the worst leg cramps of my life last week.
[09:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> But it was also really hot and humid that night. I drank about 2 liters of fluid, ate 2 protein bars, a banana, yogurt, and granola and was still down about a pound after playing ultimate. So I must've sweated out a ton of electrolytes.
[09:09:44] <ryanneufeld> holy
[09:10:14] <ryanneufeld> it's been hotter than hell here lately
[09:10:27] <ryanneufeld> I can't even step out my front door w/out breaking a sweat
[09:10:47] <ryanneufeld> I couldn't imagine trying to run in this weather (my wife get's up at 5am to beat the heat)
[09:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> I started playing ultimate again this summer after not playing for six years.
[09:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> Last week was the first time I felt like I was finally getting back in shape. My endurance is coming back and I'm able to sprint again.
[09:16:40] <scott_gonzalez> But it's been tough to train without being on a team that practices. So I've been riding my bike.
[09:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> I think that was good and bad. I rode 37 miles last week. Which helped with my endurance, but probably also helped lead to the cramps :-P
[09:18:06] <ryanneufeld> lotsa stretching
[09:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I do a warmup job and two sun salutaions before every game.
[09:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> s/job/jog/
[09:23:15] <ryanneufeld> nice

[12:53:04] <cschramm> hi DaveMethvin|away, gnarf, nacin, scott_gonzalez
[12:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[12:56:06] <gnarf> hey cschramm 
[12:56:59] <s5fs> hi everyone
[12:58:53] <gnarf> s5fs: are you adding base template for jq09/jq10  to puppet ?
[12:59:05] <gnarf> i got the ips provisioned
[13:00:01] <s5fs> gnarf: yes
[13:01:01] <gnarf> so hi cschramm scott_gonzalez s5fs - i made a hangouts call on the gcal invite, do we want to use that, or are people prefering IRC today? :)
[13:01:32] <gnarf> brianvkoch also
[13:01:33] <gnarf> yes?
[13:01:59] <cschramm> call as in voice? unfortunately no mic possible at the moment for me
[13:02:06] <cschramm> but i can listen and write ;)
[13:02:42] <brianvkoch> IRC will probably work fine for me
[13:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with either.
[13:03:40] <s5fs> i prefer hangouts but clearly am okay with irc ;)
[13:03:51] <s5fs> i like seeing everyone's smiling faces, what can i say
[13:03:53] <gnarf> okay, lets stay in IRC for now then - no mics, might as well stick to text
[13:04:09] <gnarf> so - Hey everyone!
[13:04:21] <gnarf> thanks for showing an interest in helping us with our trac situation :)
[13:04:37] <s5fs> and what a situation is is, gnarf!
[13:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> The spam has been out of control for UI recently.
[13:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> Every night someone creates another dozen spam tickets.
[13:05:29] <gnarf> currently, we have a really old version of trac 0.12 running - s5fs and I have both tried a couple times to investigate switching over to trac 1.0, we just never get anything working, etc
[13:05:58] <gnarf> as far as i know, aside from the (bad) themeing, ticketgraph is the only custom thing we really do in trac
[13:06:33] <gnarf> and i'm curious brianvkoch cschramm what you guys might need from us to start trying to get us updated to 1.0 trac - fix our databases, etc.  I know nacin did a lot of this work for the WP trac as well
[13:06:41] <nacin> yo, I'm here
[13:06:45] <s5fs> nacin: welcome!
[13:06:59] <nacin> just easy_install trac 1.0 and see what breaks :)
[13:07:24] <gnarf> we also want to be able to install trac via puppet (which is easier than it sounds, basically, if you can write a shell script to install/configure a new VM from scratch with the trac setup, we can convert to puppet)
[13:07:45] <nacin> I'd get it on 1.0 first, but yeah, that's easy
[13:07:51] <gnarf> yeah
[13:07:56] <gnarf> priority is having a not shitty trac
[13:07:59] <nacin> I'd literally just easy_install trac and see how it holds up
[13:08:01] <s5fs> haha it wasn't super easy, the db is 20gig or something
[13:08:03] <nacin> if it breaks, roll it back
[13:08:08] <nacin> back up the sqlite db first
[13:08:17] <nacin> which version are you on? 0.11?
[13:08:18] <gnarf> nacin: we are backed in mysql 
[13:08:21] <nacin> not much in terms of DB changes
[13:08:22] <gnarf> 0.12 i think
[13:08:22] <s5fs> 0.12
[13:08:26] <nacin> then it's dead simple
[13:08:34] <nacin> 0.12 to 1.0 I'm not sure had anything of note
[13:08:45] <gnarf> nacin: i remember you said you did some custom db schemas tho to optimize indexes, etc
[13:08:58] <nacin> that's cause we are using mysql now instead of sqlite
[13:09:05] <nacin> I would stick to sqlite
[13:09:12] <nacin> trac over mysql is slow as hell
[13:09:13] <gnarf> ours was also using mysql before
[13:09:16] <s5fs> here's some random notes I made some time ago: https://gist.github.com/aulvi/bd8f014f0efc1cd23814
[13:09:17] <nacin> in part because python-mysql blows
[13:09:25] <brianvkoch> yeah, I've seen trac on mysql slow, as well
[13:09:30] <nacin> the bindings are terrible and non threaded and blocking
[13:10:01] <nacin> dllh is Daryl L. L. Houston, a developer at Automattic who likely helped you guys out at one point, probably at the SF conference.
[13:10:04] <gnarf> nacin: i like the idea of using sqlite3
[13:10:16] <nacin> we did indeed write our own schema for mysql
[13:10:22] <s5fs> nacin: haha that was before my time :D
[13:10:25] <nacin> cause it made everything text fields
[13:10:31] <gnarf> but like, then we need to port it over 
[13:10:33] <nacin> so I went through and converted things to varchar and added indexes
[13:10:37] <nacin> you can leave it in mysql for now
[13:11:06] <nacin> I'd try to update to 1.0.1, if it goes wrong, just roll it back to 0.12.x
[13:11:14] <gnarf> so like - plan for moving forward - brianvkoch nacin cschramm - s5fs and I can set up a couple of (mt) hosted VMs if you don't have your own dev space
[13:11:17] <nacin> do it when DaveMethvin|away isn't paying attention
[13:11:28] <gnarf> and we can give you database dumps / ssh access to the current server
[13:11:43] <gnarf> nacin: i need to get it off of the machine its currently on as well
[13:11:48] <gnarf> and also, the whole site basically breaks
[13:11:50] <nacin> well I'd do one step at a time
[13:12:00] <gnarf> nacin: upgrade in place seems like a bad step to me
[13:12:02] <nacin> get it updated, migrate it off, then screw with the DBs
[13:12:08] <nacin> what breaks when you upgrade in place?
[13:12:18] <gnarf> potentially everything?
[13:12:24] <gnarf> bugs.jquery.com bugs.jqueryui.com
[13:12:27] <nacin> you can easily download the environment and load it up next to trac 1.0.1 if that's a problem
[13:12:37] <nacin> but what *actually* breaks? has it been tried?
[13:12:47] <ryanneufeld> I recall we had it all in mysql
[13:12:48] <gnarf> layouts, etc break when we upgraded
[13:12:51] <ryanneufeld> but there was no indexes
[13:13:01] <gnarf> database queries got screwy, something with dates
[13:13:01] <ryanneufeld> which caused some crashes due to long queries
[13:13:07] <gnarf> our custom queries got wacky
[13:13:25] <gnarf> all of these problems i remember encountering when we tried to upgrade last time
[13:13:25] <cschramm> custom queries from ticketgraph?
[13:13:44] <nacin> ticketgraph didn't work well on mysql
[13:13:50] <nacin> it was written for sqlite's syntax
[13:13:53] <nacin> I forked it a while ago
[13:14:09] <nacin> https://github.com/nacin/tracticketgraph
[13:14:10] <gnarf> cschramm: brianvkoch: can you send us your ssh pubkeys and prefered usernames?
[13:14:17] <nacin> https://github.com/nacin/TracTicketGraph/commit/e3046189610718f6942376f2fe63118e390ad688
[13:14:32] <nacin> this is also our version which I think looks/works better
[13:14:38] <brianvkoch> sure thing...what's the best way to send that to you?
[13:14:41] <nacin> https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticketgraph
[13:14:49] <gnarf> brianvkoch: e-mail i suppose :)
[13:15:04] <s5fs> we should be able to get pubkeys directly from github
[13:15:13] <gnarf> s5fs: sometimes thats more than one pubkey tho
[13:15:18] <nacin> i recall github turned off its .keys url trick
[13:15:22] <s5fs> wat!
[13:15:22] <gnarf> and you don't know which is current from github
[13:15:22] <b-ot> s5fs: how you see pual_irish these are these online?
[13:15:30] <nacin> oh, no, still works
[13:15:32] <gnarf> nacin: https://github.com/gnarf.keys
[13:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's very different looking than our ticketgraph.
[13:15:53] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: same plugin, I just added per-component stuff, made it do positive/negative so it wouldn't overlap, etc
[13:15:53] <s5fs> different better?
[13:16:03] <s5fs> nacin you so fancy
[13:16:31] <nacin> we also have more tickets
[13:16:41] <nacin> you guys could survive on github issues, us not so much
[13:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> I refuse to move to GitHub issues.
[13:17:02] <ryanneufeld> nacin: don't even go there... I've suggested it before
[13:17:07] <nacin> hey man I agree
[13:17:14] <gnarf> we can't survive on issues 
[13:17:15] <nacin> with scott_gonzalez
[13:17:22] <nacin> I'm just saying you'd survive more than we would
[13:17:24] <gnarf> also, impossible to retain history if we tried
[13:17:26] <nacin> which would still probably be death
[13:17:29] <ryanneufeld> why trac vs bugzilla tho?
[13:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> I've wanted ticketgraph filtered by type (bug, feature) for a long time.
[13:17:41] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like you've already got the basic logic in there for filtering by component.
[13:18:01] <nacin> yeah, I hacked it into the ticketgraph plugin
[13:18:42] <gnarf> so our goal: get a newest version of trac install, on sqllite3 with nacins ticket graph, a jquery theme, and bugs.jquery.com / bugs.jqueryui.com 's data
[13:18:48] <gnarf> seem legit? ^
[13:18:48] <gnarf> ?
[13:19:20] <nacin> the trac 1.0 theme is the ugliest thing ever
[13:19:26] <nacin> so be warned about the need to do some CSS
[13:19:44] <gnarf> pie in the sky dreams would be to skin it somehow we can use jquery-wp-content themes :)
[13:19:54] <nacin> that's what we do, more or less
[13:20:05] <nacin> I really would focus first on trac 1.0.x + plugins + templates, then get that live
[13:20:13] <gnarf> agree
[13:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: pie in the sky dreams = migrate to DEBT :-P
[13:20:17] <nacin> then I would deal with sqlite3 perhaps
[13:20:41] <nacin> all of our config and templates are OS, btw: https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/trac.wordpress.org/
[13:20:52] <s5fs> gnarf: That sounds like a great set of goals
[13:20:59] <s5fs> nacin: thanks!
[13:21:07] <gnarf> so - is anyone going to volunteer to like start on / look at this work? brianvkoch cschramm nacin s5fs - what do you need from us to get started?
[13:21:14] <s5fs> gnarf: I'm repurposing the old 'trac.pp' that you (or i) pooped out some time ago. be done in a bit.
[13:21:22] <gnarf> s5fs: ok
[13:21:32] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: what is the status of debt?
[13:21:59] <cschramm> ssh access and dumps should be fine
[13:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Still very much alpha.
[13:22:17] <ryanneufeld> functional?
[13:22:19] <ryanneufeld> at all?
[13:22:35] <cschramm> so we're 4 people to work on this, right? how should we coordinate?
[13:22:46] <s5fs> cschramm: its a death race
[13:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't care about closing tickets or searching or having anything other than title + comments :-P
[13:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> User registration works (via GitHub)
[13:23:02] <s5fs> we all get a VM, whoever completes the upgrade first is then sent on a quest to find and destroy the other three
[13:23:08] <brianvkoch> haha
[13:23:20] <cschramm> nice
[13:23:24] <cschramm> I'm in
[13:23:25] <cschramm> xD
[13:23:28] <s5fs> its the only way to continue the line
[13:23:36] <gnarf> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!
[13:23:38] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: nice
[13:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> permission system is built too :-)
[13:24:05] <gnarf> *shrug* i figure we can boot a couple of vms up for you - and we can coordinate in #jquery-infrastructure or via the email thread we already have going
[13:24:16] <ryanneufeld> there is also vagrant
[13:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> Next step is building the GitHub export tool and then working on custom fields.
[13:24:51] <s5fs> cschramm: most of us are on irc, and you can always email infrastructure-team@jquery.com if you have an urgent question or whatever
[13:24:57] <gnarf> I mean, at this point - what I really want to know is who has the time to actually start up with this, and I'd love to have a couple more hands on deck in case trac crashes in the future on the infra team to
[13:25:54] <cschramm> i'll definitely take a look and see what breaks on the upgrade
[13:26:13] <s5fs> cschramm: awesome!
[13:26:55] <cschramm> we'll see the size of the iceberg afterward
[13:27:25] <gnarf> also, cc everyone: please don't change any settings on the live server, but we can get you ssh to it for the purposes of copying configs / checking settings / etc
[13:27:46] <cschramm> sure thing
[13:27:55] <brianvkoch> ok, sounds good
[13:28:05] <s5fs> gnarf: what! i just created a separate 'trac' and 'tracdev' haha
[13:28:14] <gnarf> we setup two new machines now tracdev1.jquery.com and tracdev2.jquery.com 
[13:28:24] <gnarf> they are also named jq09 and jq10
[13:28:49] <jqcommit> [13infrastructure] 15aulvi pushed 1 new commit to 06puppet-stage: 02https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/14493702fa9e337b8aacdd91c6ed30a71d6a6b0a
[13:28:49] <jqcommit> 13infrastructure/06puppet-stage 141449370 15Adam Ulvi: Added Trac Dev servers.
[13:28:58] <s5fs> gnarf: wanna peek at that right quick?
[13:29:21] <gnarf> yeah
[13:29:23] <gnarf> one suggestion
[13:29:25] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/14493702fa9e337b8aacdd91c6ed30a71d6a6b0a#diff-99ec8ea2d6f28c30f9a0d57bb66577e6R269 
[13:29:28] <gnarf> jq09 and jq10
[13:29:34] <gnarf> because the certnames will be set to that?
[13:29:44] <s5fs> roger that
[13:29:51] <gnarf> also, have we gotten ssh keys from brian or cschramm yet?
[13:30:06] <cschramm> nope, who needs them? s5fs?
[13:30:11] <gnarf> yeah
[13:30:15] <gnarf> brian replied to the email
[13:30:28] <gnarf> forwarded it to you s5fs 
[13:30:39] <brianvkoch> oh, thank you
[13:31:05] <s5fs> gnarf: puppet agent on those hosts yet?
[13:31:18] <gnarf> s5fs: nope - gotta setup apt and install that by hand
[13:31:30] <s5fs> documented somewhere?
[13:32:17] <gnarf> s5fs: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/Puppet-Client-Docs#manual-installation but could probably use some updating
[13:32:28] <s5fs> cool i'll update as i work
[13:32:38] <s5fs> brianvkoch: do you have a desired username? pm it to me please :)
[13:32:50] <gnarf> check the /etc/puppet/puppet.conf from the other machines too
[13:32:58] <gnarf> i think we add a certname= too
[13:33:02] <gnarf> to force the hostname
[13:33:06] <s5fs> will do
[13:33:43] <gnarf> s5fs: one other step not in there, is to initially do the manual you can use ac.mediatemple.com to set root password for that base install
[13:35:39] <gnarf> moving forward then - the plan is - tracdev1 and tracdev2 are sandboxes, we will get you a way to download sql dump / current trac configs
[13:35:55] <gnarf> and make sure you can ssh into those boxes
[13:36:11] <gnarf> and communicate progress via e-mail updates with each other?
[13:36:31] <s5fs> If anyone gets stuck, please reach out for help.
[13:36:48] <gnarf> if anyone makes progress, please reach out for praise ;)
[13:36:57] <s5fs> YES
[13:37:41] <gnarf> also - our current theme is pretty terribly old and crappy
[13:37:45] <gnarf> we could try to copy it over
[13:37:59] <gnarf> but i think we might be better served trying to steal our own layout from our jquery-wp-content rendered pages
[13:38:09] <gnarf> i.e. a layout looking more like jquery.com / jqueryui.com look today
[13:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> Probably the last task we should work on.
[13:38:26] <gnarf> but if its easy enough to update the crap layout we already have, lets stick with it until we have more time to figure out themes
[13:38:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: in the sense that if converting the old layout would get potentially harder than trying to skin a new one
[13:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> I meant dealing with the theme at all.
[13:39:13] <s5fs> concur.
[13:39:15] <gnarf> sure
[13:39:24] <s5fs> theming implies we have a working install somewhere haha
[13:39:27] <gnarf> functional - faster - not about to crash every 10 minutes
[13:39:35] <gnarf> we can probably switch to it
[13:39:41] <gnarf> even with broken theme
[13:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> agreed, working and ugly is better than what we have today
[13:40:12] <gnarf> ^ +9000
[13:40:18] <gnarf> and i'm sure DaveMethvin|away would agree too
[13:40:21] <s5fs> puppetized alone is awesome
[13:41:23] <gnarf> any other questions from anyone? nacin cschramm brianvkoch ?
[13:41:49] <gnarf> i imagine s5fs will be able to sort out all the ssh stuffs and getting you access to stuff you need within the next hour or so
[13:41:54] <nacin> I have some stuff to get done over the next few days, but I am happy to help if anyone hits a roadblock. just ping me here.
[13:42:16] <cschramm> the mission seems clear to me
[13:42:49] <cschramm> I'll have a first look tomorrow
[13:42:55] <cschramm> how about you brianvkoch?
[13:43:05] <brianvkoch> yeah, this sounds like a good plan
[13:43:20] <gnarf> alright cool - i gotta get back to the work work for the day then - lets have a catch up meeting in IRC again next week, same time - stay in touch via email until then?
[13:43:33] <s5fs> i'm sorting the ssh stuffs out meow
[13:43:57] <gnarf> email and/or IRC
[13:43:59] <s5fs> cschramm brianvkoch i'll ping you guys when ssh access is ready
[13:44:03] <gnarf> this channel >is< publicly logged
[13:44:14] <gnarf> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-infrastructure/
[13:44:25] <cschramm> cool, thanks
[13:44:31] <brianvkoch> great, thank you
[13:45:19] <cschramm> gnarf: will probably be drunk next week, same time xD
[13:45:33] <gnarf> cschramm: is there a better time?
[13:45:44] <gnarf> or is this like balmer peak drunk? :)
[13:46:10] <brianvkoch> haha
[13:46:23] <s5fs> probably better to start the project drunk, tbh
[13:46:30] <cschramm> nope, painkiller drunk
[13:46:41] <s5fs> suffering from a broken heart
[13:46:54] <gnarf> nice :)
[13:48:01] <gnarf> I have a bouncer on IRC 24/7 also, so don't expect me to reply if I'm around, but I will eventually read it :)
[13:48:26] <s5fs> cschramm: gmail thought your ssh key was turkish spam
[13:48:41] <cschramm> probably best to set up another doodle for a catch up meeting, but I think asynchronous emails should also be fine
[13:48:51] <cschramm> turkish?! wtf?
[13:49:38] <s5fs> gnarf: does ssh_user accept an array of keys?
[13:49:51] <gnarf> key and alt_key only
[13:49:56] <gnarf> and they need to be the same type
[13:50:01] <gnarf> we could fix/change that though
[13:50:03] <gnarf> if you want ot
[13:50:23] <s5fs> not today, i have other work haha
