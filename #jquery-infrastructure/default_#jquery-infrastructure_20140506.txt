[10:42:47] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i think if we kept 30 days we'd have ourselves covered
[10:43:34] <ryanneufeld> there are multiples for each day
[10:43:40] <ryanneufeld> since puppet runs every 30mins
[10:43:48] <ryanneufeld> do we really need it to run that often?
[10:44:14] <ryanneufeld> since we usually manually run it manually when we need it any way
