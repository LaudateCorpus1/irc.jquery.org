[06:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: Just created a super tiny module for simplifying process spawning: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/spawnback
[08:26:00] <gnarf> arschmitz: what was the ping I had in #freenode today? It was so far back in my scroll I lost it
[09:17:22] <arschmitz> gnarf: #jqurrtymobile lost the forward to #jquery
[09:17:37] <arschmitz> gnarf: ajpiano has tried to fix but does not have rights
[09:17:45] <arschmitz> gnarf: they said you do
[09:21:41] <gnarf> p sure i fixed it
[09:22:01] <arschmitz> gnarf: thanks
[09:22:04] <gnarf> arschmitz: mind /part #jquery and trying to /join #jquerymobile ?
[09:22:13] <arschmitz> sure
[09:22:20] <gnarf> also ajpiano you should have had the ability to op in #jquerymobile , not sure why you couldn't set it up
[09:23:36] <arschmitz> gnarf: it does not forward but it wont let me join at least
[09:23:49] <ajpiano> gnarf i didn't realise we had done it with a forward
[09:23:51] <ajpiano> d'oh
[09:23:58] <ajpiano> and i don't have the privs to do flags 
[09:24:03] <ajpiano> so i couldn't figure out what to do
[09:24:10] <gnarf> arschmitz: now?
[09:24:15] <ajpiano> i kept trying to key it, +i it etc
[09:24:27] <ajpiano> but then eventually i would leave the channel for a sec and people would come back in and everything would go away
[09:24:30] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah, it's just +i +F #jquery
[09:24:31] <ajpiano> that's the fundamental problem i think
[09:24:37] <gnarf> but we need to keep the channel open
[09:24:42] <ajpiano> is that itg oes away when no one's in it and then it resets
[09:24:43] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:24:54] <gnarf> yeh i'll try to fix that
[09:24:54] <ajpiano> and neither of us has founder on it
[09:25:00] <ajpiano> so that we can get chanserv in there or some shit
[09:25:08] <ajpiano> thx
[09:25:14] <arschmitz> gnarf: same
[09:27:07] <gnarf> are you sure it isn't joining #jquery for you?
[09:30:13] <arschmitz> gnarf: yup
[09:30:19] <gnarf> okay
[09:30:22] <gnarf> used the wrong +F 
[09:30:24] <gnarf> needed +f
[09:34:40] <gnarf> but then i left the channel to test it
[09:34:46] <gnarf> and need ajpiano to wake up and invite me back :)
[09:37:25] <gnarf> alright
[09:37:30] <gnarf> forwarding works now
[09:37:32] <gnarf> pull me back in ajpiano 
[09:37:33] <gnarf> :)
[09:55:29] <gnarf> arschmitz done
[09:55:38] <arschmitz> gnarf: thanks
