[05:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> We're still not getting email notifications from UI's trac.
[07:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: WordPress says we have to upgrade our database.
[07:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> Should I just click the button?
[07:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> (Gonna do it on stage first)
[10:44:32] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: no email from trac?
[10:44:55] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: sorry, i was mia last night. i slept all day yesterday, i think i'm almost human once again
[10:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs: Yeah, it just stopped working the other day.
[10:46:10] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: ugh so weird. how can i easily generate a test email to myself?
[10:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> You can just find a ticket and add a comment.
[10:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> Let's use a ticket that nobody else would get notified on though.
[10:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> You can use this one: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9838#comment:3
[10:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> The only comments are from team members, so you shouldn't bother anyone by testing on it.
[10:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> And we can delete the comments later.
[10:51:02] <s5fs> okay thanks
[10:51:18] <s5fs> i have a  meeeting in a few so i'm going ot poke at this before and after
[10:51:22] <s5fs> maybe even during.
[10:56:10] <s5fs> gnarf: ping
[10:58:09] <s5fs> uh.. looks like the 'reset password' feature is borked
[11:00:25] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i can't wait for debt
[11:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, well, that's gonna take a while :-(
[11:03:05] <s5fs> after the conf it sounds like trac upgrades are a good move, so i'll be putting all my energy moving forward into that task. we're a bit behind and we run a boatload of plugins.
[11:03:25] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: who's closest to the trac install at this point? who's brain is best for picking?
[11:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> No idea. Snover seemed to know a decent amount about it, but I'm not sure who to ping.
[11:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> WordPress uses Trac, so nacin might be able to answer questions or might know someone who can.
[11:05:22] <s5fs> gotcha
[11:05:41] <s5fs> okay i'll continue on the assumption that the original implementor lost their mind and is now living in the antartic
[11:36:07] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: no worries man, I spent some time working on slides
[12:00:29] <nacin> s5fs: scott_gonzalez: we have hacked the hell out of our Trac instance. I'm happy to answer questions
[12:01:09] <nacin> We have templates, schema changes, core Trac patches, inherited config files: http://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/trac.wordpress.org/. also a lot of JS hacks.
[14:16:29] <s5fs> nacin: awesome i'll likely be pinging you once i can formulate reasonable questions :D
[14:19:59] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: yeah, I suppose asking him "Why does trac suck so bad?" is a bit open
[14:20:01] <ryanneufeld> lol
[14:20:05] <ryanneufeld> also: http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/77162384009/setting-up-new-host-with-puppet-or-chef
[15:10:43] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: nice
[18:36:38] <s5fs> scott_gonzalez: i cycled the trac service for bugs.jqueryui.com and now 'lost password' emails seem to work (which is good). i commented on the ticket and didn't see any emails though, would you mind testing again when you have a moment? I assume I should've received an email shortly after commenting, yes?
[19:27:03] <arschmitz> s5fs: you there?
[19:27:12] <arschmitz> s5fs: i got the email for your comment
[19:29:06] <arschmitz> s5fs: pretty sure you dont get an email for your own comments only other peoples
[21:19:07] <s5fs> arschmitz: that's what i was hoping
[21:19:23] <s5fs> arschmitz: thanks for following back up! also, it was super cool hanging w/you in san diego
[21:19:40] <arschmitz> for sure you too
[21:20:09] <arschmitz> gota make it out to the east coast some time
[21:20:29] <s5fs> yeah i'm really hoping to make it this year, prob sometime late summer
[21:21:07] <arschmitz> nice
[21:21:09] <s5fs> i'm still waiting to hear when nodepdx is (local node conf)
[21:21:20] <arschmitz> cool
[21:21:52] <s5fs> once that date is settled i'll be able to firm up my travel plans. i'll prob give a talk on something hardware related
[21:22:03] <arschmitz> My roomate is probably going out to portland this summer
