[05:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> Trac has been dead for a while. Can someone investigate?
[07:42:46] <gnarf> s5fs www-04 is bugs
[07:42:57] <gnarf> need to move trac onto a new box
[07:43:01] <gnarf> then we can kill it
[12:16:39] <s5fs> danheberden: can you access proxy-01.stage.jquery.net? i don't have access and wanna look it over to determine if we can drop it or not.
[12:17:28] <danheberden> s5fs: is that a puppet ran box?
[12:18:18] <s5fs> danheberden: I don't believe so
[12:18:30] <s5fs> at least I don't see it in the site.pp
[12:18:55] <gnarf> danheberden definitely isn't because I can't get in on jqadmin, root, or gnarf
[12:19:06] <gnarf> o wait
[12:19:09] <gnarf> i got root@
[12:19:13] <gnarf> lolz
[12:19:22] <s5fs> pwned
[12:19:43] <gnarf> s5fs try root@
[12:19:48] <gnarf> you had your key there already too
[12:19:59] <s5fs> oh goofy
[12:20:19] <s5fs> whee i'm in!
[12:55:54] <gnarf> danheberden whats the handy github keys list?
[12:57:10] <s5fs> gnarf: this? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/ssh-keys
[12:57:24] <gnarf> nah, there is a way to pull it out of the github user
[12:57:51] <s5fs> gnarf: http://github.com/user.keys
[12:57:58] <s5fs> gnarf: http://github.com/aulvi.keys
[12:58:03] <gnarf> yeah that
[12:58:41] <s5fs> gnarf: a while ago i added that url to the wiki article I sent you first
[13:02:08] <gnarf> feel free to keep editing on the oksoclap
[13:02:12] <gnarf> if you find more
[13:03:29] <s5fs> i'm going drop that first group out of dns, then i can clean up the wiki article and punch out another article on how to update the list
[13:06:59] <gnarf> cool, remove em from the clap when you done
[13:07:58] <gnarf> just added another to the list
[13:07:58] <gnarf> * [] review.jquery.com
[13:07:58] <gnarf>     * reverse not pointed to jquery: 66-199-227-42.reverse.ezzi.net
[13:08:13] <gnarf> actually
[13:08:15] <s5fs> yeah i see
[13:08:16] <gnarf> just mark an [x] 
[13:08:27] <gnarf> we can post this as a comment on the audit issue
[13:08:30] <gnarf> when we finish
[13:08:56] <s5fs> yup
[13:09:05] <s5fs> okay see those X's? look good for delete, final call!
[13:09:48] <s5fs> gone
[13:11:36] <gnarf> adding 
[13:11:37] <gnarf> * [] prod-04.jquery.net
[13:11:37] <gnarf>     * Does not reverse, is this machine already down? (is it listed in media temple)
[13:11:54] <gnarf> in the less certain section
[13:12:01] <gnarf> if we answer the is it listed in (mt) 
[13:12:12] <gnarf> i think we can just delete all those dns entries
[13:12:58] <gnarf> lets just move it up to the "kill now" list
[13:14:14] <s5fs> roger
[13:16:41] <gnarf> woah

[13:31:39] <s5fs> thanks danheberden 
[13:39:16] <gnarf> danheberden - would you put manage.jquery.net  and manage.stage.jquery.net on the "chopping block" - Also, can you scan the ## Further Investigation Needed on https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/192#issuecomment-24951360
[13:39:54] <gnarf> also cc scott_gonzalez ^^^
[13:48:10] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: ping
[13:56:57] <s5fs> gnarf danheberden chopping block updated (manage and manage.stage)
[14:00:47] <uGoMobi> hey guys
[14:01:03] <uGoMobi> can one of you take a look at view.jquerymobile.com
[14:01:33] <uGoMobi> master is not on latest commit
[14:02:05] <uGoMobi> we had the same problem last week
[14:03:06] <uGoMobi> looks like it didn't update anymore after last Tuesday
[14:03:38] <uGoMobi> thanks
[14:04:11] <gnarf> something must of crashed --- the .lock file was there
[16:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> I've never heard of manage.jquery.net. Seems like it can die.
[21:53:48] <s5fs> gnarf: I've added a wiki article for updating the AFXR report (https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/How-to-update-the-DNS-AXFR-report). In doing so I also updated the AXFR report, haha!
