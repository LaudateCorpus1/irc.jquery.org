[01:31:32] <shibly> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/ , is ajaxStart() always with $(document). ?
[01:31:50] <shibly> Can i do something like $("div").ajaxStart() ?
[02:19:34] <Mark___> hello. does anybody know how i can give owl-carousel’s autoheight a subtraction of 25px off of its current height? im afraid it’s somewhere in the js script that i cannot find. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/#
[03:01:05] <Jittler> How can I get which child has a class? I can find the child with the class, but how do I return n for :nth-of-child for that element? I have something like <ul> <li>item 1</li> <li><ul><li>i2c1</li><li>i2c2</li><li>i2c3</li></ul></li> <li>item 3</li> </ul> and want to do something with the top ul based on which of item 2's li's has a class.
[08:30:15] <silverdust> When i have an element like a modal or a drop down how is the best way to specify that on click of any other part of the body they should be closed
[08:32:20] <silverdust> If I had a drop down that is like $('.mydropdownInit').click -> $(this).siblings('.dropdown').slideToggle()
[08:33:32] <silverdust> now definitely clicking my dropdowninit will close it when it's opened but what if I want it to also get closed if any other part of the document body is clicked
[08:34:42] <silverdust> I've always done $('body').click() but something just feels wrong about it. Is there a better way? Like a callback from within the init that also tells it to close up when other parts of the web page is clicked
[11:00:02] <seemikehack> Hey all. I'm trying to allow a user to edit data in a table cell by replacing the contents with an input, then storing the value of the input in the table cell when they're done. Two questions: why is the blur event not firing when I click out of the input, and why does the td still get the click event when the input is open even after calling preventDefault/stopPropagation on click events in the input? http://codepen.io/seemikehack/pen/bEErKJ
[11:03:33] <shoky_> seemikehack: you're adding the click and blur handlers on $(input) before you have set input to anything, the input doesn't exist yet. it's undefined, you're actually running  $(undefined).click(...).blur(...)
[11:04:14] <shoky_> either add the handlers after the input exists,  (but then you'd need to add handlers each time you append a new input)
[11:04:47] <shoky_> or use event delegation  e.g.  $(document).on('click', 'input', function(e) { ... })
[11:06:07] <seemikehack> shoky_, ah, thanks, I didn't make the connection. I'll add a class to the input and register the handler on the class.
[11:06:39] <shoky_> doing $('.someclass').click(...).blur(...)  won't help btw if the input doesn't exist yet
[11:06:45] <seemikehack> shoky_, I'm kind of annoyed with myself, I've dealt with event registration on dynamically generated elements before, I should have know.
[11:07:08] <seemikehack> shoky_, no, like you said, $(document).on('click', '.editable', function () {})
[11:07:24] <seemikehack> shoky_, just so it's not on all inputs.
[11:08:50] <shoky_> yah. though that might actually be problematic cause it'll bubble up to the document only after it already bubbles to the <td>
[11:10:01] <seemikehack> shoky_, can't I stopPropagation?
[11:10:20] <seemikehack> Or not, because it's delegated from the document?
[11:10:22] <shoky_> seemikehack: it won't help, because it has already propagated to the <td> before reaching document
[11:10:40] <shoky_> seemikehack: i'd just check in the <td> click handler,  if e.target is .editable
[11:10:47] <shoky_> e.g.  $(e.target).is('.editable')
[11:10:48] <seemikehack> Hmm. Can I set a flag, like editing=true?
[11:10:51] <seemikehack> Or that, yeah.
[11:14:00] <repxl> hello, whats whats wrong with this ? href="javascript:(function(){ window.open('http://www.youhref.dev/?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href), '_blank', 'height=500, width=500');}();"
[11:16:05] <seemikehack> shoky_, now the input loses focus as soon as it's opened. I solved this in the previous version, so I'll probably figure it out again. Thanks for the tips, by the way!
[11:16:53] <seemikehack> shoky_, nvm, I'm dumb :)
[11:17:21] <seemikehack> shoky_, well, only a little dumb.
[11:18:20] <shoky_> ;]
[11:21:37] <seemikehack> shoky_, several kinds of dumb, actually. I frequently give things a class name of '.className', because I'm so used to working in JS and forget that I don't need the selector in the actual stinkin' class name :)
[11:21:49] <seemikehack> shoky_, thanks again for the tips, and your time!
[11:36:28] <AbuDhar> http://pastie.org/10641630 you see anything wrong here?

[17:05:55] <AbuDhar> :/
[17:31:35] <multi_io> when storing single DOM elements (e.g. divs) in data structures for passing them around in your program, do you generally store the single element or the corresponding one-element jquery nodeset?
[17:33:00] <jangoh2> $('#term-year input:checked').val()  hey how do i do it?
[17:36:00] <rcyr> Like that?
