[17:11:13] <asdfgh> hello
[17:11:36] <asdfgh> i need to loop on inputs that have id attribute like: $('input[id="id_notes-{number_here}-description"]').each(function() { ... }
[17:11:46] <asdfgh> id_notes-1-description for example
[17:12:22] <asdfgh> i need to do two things:     1. loop over them i need to understand how to change that {number_here} :D     2. get that number in the id attribute
[17:12:29] <asdfgh> how can i do that?
[17:25:16] <asdfgh> got disconnected
[17:25:18] <asdfgh> anyone?
[17:36:29] <shoky_> asdfgh would be better not to use an id for that number (but e.g. some data-xxx attribute and a shared class). but if cant control that, you could use .filter() with a regexp
[17:36:42] <shoky_> asdfgh: e.g.  e.g. const notesRe = /^id_notes-(\d+)-description$/;  $('input[id^="id_notes-"]').filter(function() { return notesRe.test(this.id); }).each(function() { const id = notesRe.exec(this.id)[1]; ... })
[17:36:59] <asdfgh> ok
[17:37:02] <asdfgh> thanks
