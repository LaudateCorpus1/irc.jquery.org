[01:21:45] <itsgokul> help i need regexp for blocking special characters and multiple spaces
[01:23:59] <Woet> itsgokul: for what purpose?
[01:27:45] <itsgokul> validation
[01:28:05] <itsgokul> textbox
[01:39:46] <Woet> itsgokul: why would you do that client side?
[01:39:51] <Woet> itsgokul: and why would you block them?
[01:41:43] <Woet> itsgokul: none of that included "please talk to me in private"
[02:10:50] <Cork> itsgokul: normally that is better done by validating the result before or as the form is submitted
[02:11:19] <Cork> itsgokul: preventing entering characters in the field is normally a bad idea and is discouraged by the web standards
[02:11:54] <itsgokul> yes validating when form is submitted using regexp
[02:12:26] <itsgokul> source
[02:12:34] <Cork> then just do ex. /(  +|[abc])/
[02:12:58] <Cork> that would fail to validate if "  " (or more) or a b or c exists in the string
[02:13:32] <itsgokul> it wont work because there can be multiple spaces between words
[02:13:46] <Cork> ya?
[02:13:57] <Cork> wasn't that what you wanted to catch?
[02:14:09] <itsgokul> yes it will fail
[02:14:19] <Cork> i don't follow
[02:14:34] <Cork> you want to catch it but you can't use a regex that catches it
[02:14:44] <itsgokul> eg: black brown fox        jumped
[02:14:50] <itsgokul> your regexp wont wont
[02:14:58] <Cork> it would catch those spaces ya
[02:14:59] <itsgokul> work
[02:15:08] <itsgokul> typo
[02:15:33] <Woet> [14:39:45]  <Woet>	itsgokul: why would you do that client side?
[02:15:33] <Woet> [14:39:50]  <Woet>	itsgokul: and why would you block them?
[02:20:43] <itsgokul> why not validate in client side ?
[02:20:49] <itsgokul> brb
[02:21:07] <Woet> because.. its client side?
[02:21:24] <Woet> the client (aka me) can just bypass it or change it to suit my needs?
[02:21:52] <Cork> doesn't mean it is a bad idea to validate it client side, just that it is bad to JUST validate it client side
[02:22:03] <Woet> Cork: of course
[02:43:44] <itsgokul> yes validation is applied in server side also using regexp
[02:47:49] <Woet> itsgokul: and why do you need to block these characters?
[02:49:59] <Woet> itsgokul: again, none of that included "please talk to me in private"
[02:50:38] <itsgokul> Woet please stop asking why i need to block these characters
[02:51:01] <itsgokul> i want data to look clean and neat
[02:51:02] <Woet> itsgokul: please answer then
[02:51:08] <Woet> itsgokul: which data?
[02:53:20] <Cork> itsgokul: if you just want to do it to make the data "clean" then just strip extra spaces for example
[02:53:29] <Cork> no need to require the user to clean it
[02:53:34] <Cork> (manually)
[02:54:06] <Cork> itsgokul: and also you have already gotten how to do it
[02:55:36] <Woet> he already had the regex if he's validating server side like he said
[02:55:52] <Cork> might not be regex server side
[02:55:58] <Cork> but ya too much info is missing
[02:56:20] <itsgokul> i want to stop entering multiple spaces in first place not clean data after its entered
[02:56:40] <Cork> itsgokul: what about ex. pasting into the field then?
[02:56:45] <Cork> you want to forbid that?
[02:56:53] <Cork> cause you can't automatically clean that
[02:57:04] <Cork> (by preventing entering)
[02:57:19] <itsgokul> im checking on form submit so it will show message about spaces
[02:57:44] <Cork> ok?
[02:57:46] <Cork> so?
[02:57:54] <Cork> then you have the validation you asked for
[02:58:10] <itsgokul> no idont have the regexp code
[02:58:42] <Cork> well you have the regex doing the validation you're asking for i gave you close to 2 hours ago
[02:59:00] <itsgokul> that is not correct
[02:59:12] <Cork> as in cause?
[02:59:32] <itsgokul> that return multiple spaces as valid
[02:59:36] <Cork> no
[02:59:38] <Cork> it doesn't
[03:00:10] <Cork> the regex is to catch invalid characters, and it does that just fine
[03:04:11] <itsgokul> i wil send video
[03:04:32] <Cork> why not create a jsfiddle.net showing what you're trying to do instead
[03:10:11] <bbrala> Hi everyone, i´m experimenting rewriting my jQuery plugin to es6 using webpack and bable to build and transpile the code. I´m looking for the correct way to enable $.fn and $.[plugin] in the jquery scope when the plugin in integrated in other applications. I can´t really find any good resources on this. Does anyone know how, or know of plugins that i could check out as an example?	
[03:10:11] <bbrala> The branch is located at; https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/tree/es6-experiment	
[03:10:11] <bbrala> An application where i see a problem is with the following lines
[03:10:11] <bbrala> > import iconRenderer from './iconRenderer';
[03:10:12] <bbrala> > import $ from 'jquery';
[03:10:14] <bbrala> > import 'jquery-contextmenu';	
[03:10:16] <bbrala> which doesn´t expose $.contextMenu appearantly, anyone have any idea why this would happen, or what i should do differently so the plugin applies to the global jQuery object?
[04:22:22] <TeddyMurray> how do you change a request payload into form data?
[04:22:41] <TeddyMurray> https://workfar.com when you click login its doing a post, but its not properly submitting the post -- im using serialize()
[04:22:55] <TeddyMurray> its making a url string, but i want it to put the data model in it
[04:37:18] <TeddyMurray> =[
[04:51:07] <AdamPDotty> With POST you do not send the data via url.
[05:33:35] <Cork> AdamPDotty: actually you can use both
[05:33:49] <Cork> AdamPDotty: the spec is actually only that GET don't have a body

[09:49:31] <MaxFrames> hello
[09:49:51] <MaxFrames> I have a problem with some javascript/jquery code that behaves differently in firefox and in chrome
[09:50:25] <MaxFrames> I am getting some values on an html5 table when the user moves from a cell to another in the table, using $(this)
[09:50:49] <MaxFrames> the problem is when the user moves from a cell to another cell in a different row
[09:51:12] <MaxFrames> the code is supposed to grab values from the first row (the row the user moved from)
[09:51:19] <MaxFrames> firefox grabs the correct values
[09:51:31] <MaxFrames> chrome grabs the values of the second row (the row the user moved to)
[09:51:38] <MaxFrames> can you help?
[09:58:34] <Dro> Hello, i'm looking for a working example of text parsed to HTML, anyone want to test this with me ?
[09:58:55] <Dro> for example: test = '<div class="one"><p id="two">Hello</p></div>'
[09:59:04] <Dro> parsed = $.parseHTML(test);
[09:59:31] <Dro> None of $(parsed).find('.one') and $(parsed).find('#two') works
[09:59:34] <Dro> any idea?
[10:01:32] <localh0st> Dro: var parsed = jQuery('<div class="one"><p id="two">Hello</p></div>');
[10:04:00] <Cork> Dro: when you $(parsed).find('#two') should work
[10:04:17] <Dro> localh0st: I tried this, but $(parsed).find('#two') return undefined
[10:04:18] <Cork> the class is the outer most element so $(parsed).filter('.one') should work there
[10:04:55] <Cork> localh0st: and you should use $.parseHTML when you parse html, as $() can choke on it if you for ex. have leading spaces
[10:05:11] <Dro> Cork: even with .filter it don't works
[10:05:32] <Cork> Dro: btw .find() should NEVER return undefined
[10:05:45] <Cork> you're not using jquery if it does
[10:05:48] <Dro> Cork: it return 0 length object
[10:06:48] <Cork> Dro: https://jsfiddle.net/pzjzcxxy/1/
[10:07:01] <Cork> opps typo...
[10:07:19] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/pzjzcxxy/1/
[10:07:24] <Cork> ... * https://jsfiddle.net/pzjzcxxy/2/
[10:08:50] <Cork> and do make the two selectors the same https://jsfiddle.net/pzjzcxxy/3/
[10:09:02] <Cork> so ya it works just fine
[10:09:27] <Dro> hmmm Cork with .text() it works :p
[10:09:37] <Cork> Dro: .length should work too
[10:09:47] <Dro> thanks Cork !
[10:09:52] <Dro> always helpfull :)
[10:09:54] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/pzjzcxxy/4/
[10:40:07] <Dro> Cork: I think this don't work for a long HTML string (full code)
[10:40:10] <Dro> do u agree ?
[10:54:27] <Cork> Dro: nope works just fine
[10:54:52] <Cork> it doesn't work for none fragments though
[10:55:07] <Cork> you can have <html><head><body> and things like that in it
[10:55:32] <Cork> (only tags you can legally add in <body>)
[10:56:33] <Dro> Cork: not sure why when I try to parse a full HTML page code, some tags are missing
[10:56:44] <Dro> especially divs with ids
[10:57:04] <Cork> Dro: make an example in the jsfiddle, but remember not anything outside <body>
[10:58:57] <Cork> a simple way to include long strings in jsfiddle is to add a <script type="text/template"></script> with the string in it in the html section
[11:03:15] <Cork> Dro: quick example https://jsfiddle.net/uek5Lc6z/
[12:03:10] <nitrospectide> I'm trying to do something where a command fires if a link is clicked (I have that part working), but NOT if the link has the class .close on it. the setup on this if not right, but I need help to fix it: https://hastebin.com/ukovuxakiw.php
[12:04:07] <taplar> you can do :not(.close) as part of a selector
[12:04:27] <taplar> which you are doing but incorrectly
[12:04:45] <taplar> !$(this).hasClass('close')
[12:05:12] <nitrospectide> Can I just place that in my if test?
[12:05:18] <taplar> but personally i'd put that on your child filter
[12:05:33] <taplar> .children("span.full-info:not(.close)")
[12:08:37] <nitrospectide> taplar: That much more concise syntax is a lot better. Oddly though, it still fires if the close class is present. Why? https://hastebin.com/tonahotamu.xml
[12:10:51] <taplar> the close class is on the span?  and it's firing for that span?
[12:12:16] <nitrospectide> https://hastebin.com/oxixuhowaz.xml
[12:13:18] <nitrospectide> Hmm. It's another piece of jQuery that is doign the toggle. I wonder if it is removing the .close class before this bit of jQuery fires.
[12:13:30] <taplar> oh
[12:13:42] <taplar> so the close class is added dynamically later?
[12:14:10] <taplar> if that's the case then yeah, you'll have to check the class inside the handler instead
[13:13:42] <robertmaxrees> gooood morning, #jquery
[13:13:55] <taplar> bonjour
[13:14:03] <robertmaxrees> how goes?
[13:14:17] <taplar> we moved into our new old work space
[13:14:42] <taplar> i have a bigger corner now
[13:15:26] <robertmaxrees> niiic
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> *e
[13:16:50] <taplar> and one of our pairing stations is situated between awkwardcough and me, so when we want to pair we can just slide over.  also nice, cause when we're not pairing it we can have some stuff that we look at a lot pulled up on it.
[13:16:52] <nitrospectide> taplar: why would the alert on line 12 never fire? https://hastebin.com/qabahofaze.js
[13:17:27] <taplar> the link doesn't have the less class on it
[13:19:29] <taplar> Methods like .children("span.full-info a.less") are not continuously re-evaluated
[13:19:40] <taplar> it runs, finds what it finds, and then operates on them
[13:20:17] <taplar> So if it runs at a time that the link doesn't have the less class, it will not find the element to bind the event handler to
[13:20:19] <nitrospectide> taplar: right - so it should fire, since the selector uses :not(".less"), right?
[13:20:38] <taplar> ah, i see
[13:20:39] <nitrospectide> hmm
[13:20:40] <taplar> one sec
[13:20:55] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/vpz8o60n/53/ lines 8-13 does it ring a bell...our yesterday discussion
[13:21:19] <dimi1947> I still have a problem...just realized it
[13:21:33] <nitrospectide> taplar: It actually needs to be this I think (though it still doesn't fire): a:not('.less')
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what's the problem?
[13:21:49] <taplar> nitrospectide: jQuery("div#node-2348").parent() seems weird in that the elements don't seem to have a shared parent, so the parent would be the document.body
[13:22:17] <taplar> nitrospectide: which if that is accurate you should just do a find for the links, not use children like that
[13:22:42] <dimi1947> my original aim was to style the whole group and not the individual inputs...this is what the code does now
[13:23:05] <dimi1947> I have to style div WHERE the inputs are contained
[13:23:32] <nitrospectide> taplar: Actually, they do have a shared parent div, I juts failed to include it.
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> do then find the parend div for those inputs that aren't selected.
[13:23:37] <taplar> k
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you already have the unselected inputs.
[13:24:27] <dimi1947> yes  I have the unselected ones...
[13:24:33] <dimi1947> where from there
[13:24:39] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to do this.
[13:25:21] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 was this the plan from the start?
[13:25:29] <dimi1947> yes...
[13:25:41] <dimi1947> my mistake I was not clear
[13:25:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:25:58] <robertmaxrees> you're making this really convoluted.
[13:26:11] <robertmaxrees> so your real question is "how do I get all divs with unselected children?"
[13:26:11] <taplar> nitrospectide: https://jsfiddle.net/wxpke5wh/  change children to find
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> right?
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> *unselected child inputs
[13:26:29] <taplar> the nested selector is probably causing an issue with the children method
[13:27:22] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 lucky for youy, you've already solved that problem.
[13:27:25] <robertmaxrees> *you
[13:27:39] <dimi1947> can you elaborate?
[13:27:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vpz8o60n/54/
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> i renamed that function to reflect what it's actually getting you.
[13:30:11] <nitrospectide> taplar: Well this is odd. The first one now fires (alert("show on " + thisID);) but it fires whether I am opening or closing. I can see the ".less" class appearing and disappearing, but the selector on the first one always tests true, on the second, false, it seems?
[13:30:27] <dimi1947> this how I want to style it...the aim is to style only the non-checked,the code though styles also the checked(that is undesirable)
[13:30:35] <taplar> remember what i said about the lookups not re-evaluating?
[13:30:54] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 duder
[13:30:55] <robertmaxrees> we'
[13:31:04] <robertmaxrees> we've shown you this a few times now.
[13:31:10] <taplar> the -only- purpose of a selector in a lookup, is to find elements, -at that point in time-, that match
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> you have a function already that does exactly what you need.
[13:31:39] <nitrospectide> taplar: Well, what would be the right way to handle this dynamic change, then? IT seems we should go back to my originals if() check?
[13:31:44] <taplar> no
[13:31:49] <taplar> the selector only runs once
[13:31:59] <taplar> it's not in a loop
[13:32:01] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 look at the fiddle i updated and check out that function i renamed for you.
[13:32:03] <taplar> it's not in an event handler
[13:32:06] <taplar> it runs once
[13:32:41] <dimi1947> give me the fiddle link again
[13:32:43] <taplar> oh, sorry, i missed your "what would"
[13:32:45] <taplar> :(
[13:33:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vpz8o60n/54/ dimi1947
[13:33:04] <taplar> you either use a delegate event binding, or you check the class inside the handler
[13:33:15] <vish93> Could anyone reccomend a good photo and photo gallery ?
[13:34:18] <dimi1947> no...if I check the inputs the the styles applied anyway
[13:34:32] <nitrospectide> taplar:  right, but what if it's like: https://jsfiddle.net/wxpke5wh/2/
[13:34:58] <taplar> yep you can do that
[13:35:03] <nitrospectide> that's like what I originally had. I just don't know the proper syntax
[13:35:12] <dimi1947> the style must be apllued only to the unchecked inputs
[13:35:21] <taplar> $(this).hasClass('theClass')
[13:36:58] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 ....
[13:36:59] <robertmaxrees> dude
[13:37:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vpz8o60n/55/
[13:37:28] <robertmaxrees> why would I rename that function to "groupHasNoCheckedBoxex"?
[13:37:31] <robertmaxrees> also: typo hahaha
[13:38:01] <taplar> it's like zerox
[13:38:07] <taplar> xerox?
[13:38:08] <taplar> bah
[13:38:08] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i'd really, really recommend doing something like learn.jquery.com
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> because you're repeating the same questions almost every day.,
[13:39:02] <dimi1947> anyway..thanks...do you think the code that does all these can become more efficient?
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you're nowhere near being able to ask that question heh
[13:39:46] <dimi1947> it is difficult to learn new JS concepts in just a few days
[13:40:20] <nitrospectide> taplar: I have set it up like the following, and my .less class appears/vanishes at the right times, but it never fires the alert: https://jsfiddle.net/wxpke5wh/4/
[13:40:30] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i didn't say it was easy.  i'm saying that you really need to get a grasp on the basics ;?
[13:40:34] <robertmaxrees> * :/
[13:40:48] <dimi1947> I AM TRYING
[13:41:09] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i'm not saying you're not trying.  i'm saying you gotta walk before you can run :)
[13:41:16] <taplar> nitrospectide: 'theClass' was just a placeholder, :)  Replace it with the class you are concerned about
[13:41:25] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 https://learn.jquery.com/performance/
[13:41:51] <robertmaxrees> fwiw,.
[13:41:58] <robertmaxrees> the learning center contains a wealth of info.
[13:46:04] <nitrospectide> taplar: Derp. I'm an idiot. Sorry.
[13:50:05] <nitrospectide> taplar: Somehow, still not working when I put the class name in: if(jQuery(this).hasClass('less')) {
[13:51:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wxpke5wh/6/
[14:10:31] <nitrospectide> taplar: That does it nicely, if I put my add/remove in this, instead of the other, separate open/close script. Yes -unfortunately, I have to have two separate, because one is part of another, existing thing, and this has to be i na different file where the node ID is available in PHP (complicated - don't ask… it's a retrofit)
[14:11:07] <taplar> then you'll have to work through the differences.  but as you see, the concept is valid
[14:12:05] <nitrospectide> taplar: Absolutely. Thank you for your help!
[14:12:12] <taplar> np man
[14:19:53] <Guest1141> how to position scrolled container at the right edge
[14:20:10] <Guest1141> havent done this in a while
[14:20:24] <Guest1141> x-y+z?
[14:21:00] <taplar> not sure if you are asking about horizonal or vertical scroll position
[14:21:09] <Guest1141> horizontal
[14:21:49] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/
[14:22:26] <Guest1141> yeah my divs are screwed
[14:22:34] <Guest1141> so it wont work that simply
[14:22:48] <Guest1141> some1 made this stupid container too wide
[14:23:07] <Guest1141> since they probly couldnt get the scrolling to work lol

[15:16:15] <Guest1141> dont do it
[15:16:33] <Guest1141> how do i sroll to the right edge of some dif
[15:16:36] <Guest1141> v
[15:16:42] <Guest1141> on the right
[15:16:51] <Guest1141> left is easy
[15:17:10] <taplar> i'm not sure i follow
[15:17:36] <Guest1141> so the right edge of the div is flush with the right edge of container
[15:17:38] <taplar> you mean scroll right so that an element comes fully into view?
[15:17:54] <Guest1141> since its the last element
[15:18:29] <Guest1141> i think its better to just fix the damn scrolling div
[15:18:41] <Guest1141> so its not wider than the items it holds
[15:18:53] <Guest1141> some idiot did this
[15:19:02] <Guest1141> not my fault
[15:22:28] <taplar> you'd want to scroll right the amount of space left of the element + the width of the element
[15:24:52] <Guest1141> umm
[15:25:22] <Guest1141> is it ok if im still confused
[15:27:56] <Guest1141> argh
[15:28:06] <Guest1141> i just have to scroll a lil more
[15:28:14] <Guest1141> and im there
[15:35:07] <taplar> something like this  https://jsfiddle.net/pL69s9m7/
[15:39:05] <benm> I am loading dynamic content in a modal. I have a link in the modal <a href="/url" data-ajax="true">Click</a> and I have this jQuery - $('body').on('click', '[data-ajax]', function(e){ ... }); - but it isn't triggering on the link.
[15:42:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cbm3zvyg/  seems to work
[15:46:55] <benm> taplar: not what I stated
[15:47:25] <taplar> it worked with /url, though it did a page redirect cause it's a link
[15:47:36] <benm> taplar: please read what I was asking.
[15:47:43] <taplar> you said it's not triggering
[15:47:46] <benm> I said I am loading dynamic content with a modal
[15:47:51] <taplar> doesn't matter
[15:47:54] <taplar> you're doing a delegate
[15:47:57] <taplar> same as i am
[15:48:15] <benm> the click event in the dynamic content isn't triggering the click event
[15:48:33] <taplar> which that fiddle shows it is triggering for the href of #
[15:48:34] <benm> I understand the .on should work, but isn't
[15:48:41] <taplar> if you change your href to # does it work?
[15:49:30] <benm> nope
[15:49:39] <taplar> if you change it to # for debugging and it still doesn't trigger that handler, then my next suggestion would be that something is terminating the propagation of the event
[15:49:59] <taplar> or, the selector isn't accurate
[15:50:40] <benm> nvm I figured it out, thank you. user error
[15:50:53] <taplar> selector?
[15:52:46] <benm> no, I am using Yii2 and the framework was overriding my data-method="post"
[15:52:51] <benm> I remove that and it worked
[15:56:52] <taplar> awesome
[16:12:20] <phelix> Anyone know why this AJAX isn't running? https://pastebin.com/8mSEQcJf Doesn't seem like its even trying to do anything. I don't get any errors or anything
[16:13:39] <taplar> do you see the request in the network console?
[16:13:59] <Guest1141> maybe its lazy
[16:14:13] <phelix> nope. I can even type interval; in console and it tells me interval is not defined
[16:14:29] <taplar> you won't be able to access it in the console as it's scoped to the document ready
[16:14:36] <phelix> ah ok
[16:14:47] <phelix> Could that be the problem why none of its working?
[16:14:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:15:07] <taplar> no, you're setTimeout is within the scope
[16:15:26] <taplar> nothing is jumping out at me as to why it's not firing
[16:15:40] <phelix> Yea, really weird.. not sure what to do or how to troubleshoot this.
[16:15:56] <taplar> $(this).serialize() doesn't make sense though
[16:16:00] <taplar> this there would be the window
[16:16:10] <robertmaxrees> any js errors at all?
[16:16:16] <phelix> no errors
[16:16:16] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/ou4w420s/ throws a 404 like I'd expect.
[16:16:33] <phelix> its inside <script></script> in some html
[16:16:43] <robertmaxrees> what if you put a console.log('foo') right above the ajax call?
[16:16:50] <phelix> Yea I tried that. I see the console.log
[16:17:20] <taplar> console.log(this) right above the ajax call
[16:17:24] <phelix> k
[16:18:04] <phelix> I am getting a Window object every second.
[16:18:12] <taplar> every second?
[16:18:20] <phelix> seems about that
[16:18:31] <taplar> so it is executing
[16:18:40] <taplar> cause the only way it'd loop is for the complete
[16:18:41] <phelix> yup.. just the Ajax doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[16:19:01] <robertmaxrees> it's not hitting the success block./
[16:19:02] <taplar> so you should be seeing it in the network console, though you need to fix that serialize
[16:19:17] <phelix> yea. I haven't even made it that far.. I can just nuke that for now
[16:19:19] <robertmaxrees> dataType: 'json', - try killing this.
[16:20:28] <phelix> removed that.. Still not calling anything. Or even trying.
[16:20:35] <robertmaxrees> it IS trying though.
[16:20:44] <robertmaxrees> you're hitting that complete block.
[16:20:54] <robertmaxrees> you sure you aren't filtering out the call in your network tab?
[16:20:57] <phelix> ok.. I think i got it
[16:21:00] <phelix> thanks guys
[16:21:03] <phelix> I see it trying now
[16:21:13] <taplar> so now, fix the serialize
[16:21:19] <phelix> doing that now
[16:21:29] <robertmaxrees> what was is?
[16:21:31] <robertmaxrees> *it
[16:21:40] <phelix> I removed that dataType: 'json'
[16:21:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:21:47] <phelix> seemed to get it going.. Not sure why that would have caused it
[16:21:56] <taplar> cause that forces the response to be json
[16:21:59] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:22:04] <taplar> you can't not be json
[16:22:05] <phelix> ahh gotcha.. thanks guys
[16:22:06] <robertmaxrees> if the response isn't valid JSON, it fails.
[16:22:06] <taplar> *it
[16:22:19] <phelix> If the response is HTML what should I use?
[16:22:24] <taplar> nothing
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> you can leave it alone.
[16:22:29] <robertmaxrees> it'll autodetect for you.
[16:22:30] <phelix> perfect.. thanks
[16:26:03] <taplar> kudos for the usage of setTimeout btw
[16:28:17] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:28:55] <robertmaxrees> kudos to taplar for being awesome.
[16:29:02] <taplar> lies
[16:29:43] <taplar> you taking any vaca for christmas?
[16:31:03] <robertmaxrees> just christmas day.  Might take New Years Day off, too, but I need the distraction.
[16:31:05] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[16:32:48] <taplar> i took the rest of the week and awkwardcough is covering my on call
[16:33:05] <taplar> you had to use vaca for christmas day, itself?
[16:34:23] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[16:35:06] <robertmaxrees> there are only 4 days a year the entire office closes down, though.
[16:35:12] <robertmaxrees> because of the call center.
[16:35:23] <taplar> ah
[16:35:38] <robertmaxrees> can't have different pto/hto/holiday schedules for different departments.
[16:35:39] <taplar> i'm not sure if our call center is down on christmas or not
[16:36:07] <robertmaxrees> D: i'd hope they do.
[17:19:44] <FishPencil> What's the correct way to make a json ajax request and use the data elsewhere? I'm rewriting for $.ajax({async: false}) right now but idk if there's a better way
[17:20:06] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways
[17:20:16] <robertmaxrees> async: false is a terrible idea.
[17:20:46] <robertmaxrees> when you say "use the data elsehwere", what do you mean?
[17:20:47] <Guest1141> FishPencil: checkout promizes
[17:21:04] <Guest1141> or just use teh callback
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:21:26] <robertmaxrees> the $.ajax object returns a promise - was heading down that route.
[17:21:36] <robertmaxrees> but without context it can be hard to grok :)
[17:21:59] <FishPencil> var outside; $.getJSON(..., function(data) {... outside = data;});
[17:22:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you really don't want to do that.
[17:22:13] <Guest1141> yeah its right
[17:22:17] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the var scoped like that?
[17:22:35] <Guest1141> but u want the timing right
[17:22:35] <FishPencil> because some data comes from one place and some from another
[17:22:37] <Guest1141> not score
[17:22:39] <Guest1141> scope
[17:23:05] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil so the way you've written this currently is going to make it a little weird.
[17:23:07] <FishPencil> I need to be able to use the data from the first request in other parts, so scope is outside
[17:23:11] <robertmaxrees> but I'm guessing you're calling ajax multiple times?
[17:23:19] <robertmaxrees> or just once?
[17:23:34] <FishPencil> yes, but one of them is on first load, and the other is at regular intervals
[17:23:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x0n6Laab/
[17:23:57] <robertmaxrees> I'd do something like this.
[17:24:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x0n6Laab/1/
[17:24:50] <robertmaxrees> basically, you learn to use .then()
[17:25:04] <Guest1141> yeah
[17:25:24] <robertmaxrees> aka promises, like Guest1141 suggested.
[17:25:35] <Guest1141> there is way to do it w out promise
[17:25:52] <Guest1141> like to pass teh callback
[17:26:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that honestly.
[17:26:15] <Guest1141> ur not his mom
[17:26:23] <robertmaxrees> promises are a much better abstraction in cases like this.
[17:26:48] <Guest1141> promizes r fun to learn
[17:26:56] <robertmaxrees> sure are.
[17:26:59] <Guest1141> but its simple
[17:27:08] <FishPencil> how do I get the data from the first into the 2nd call
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> not for some people.
[17:27:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x0n6Laab/2/
[17:27:38] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil ^
[17:27:43] <Guest1141> u just do var pDataPromise = getData();
[17:27:53] <Guest1141> then anywhre else u can do
[17:28:05] <robertmaxrees> Guest1141 alreadyt beat you to it ;)
[17:28:10] <Guest1141> pDataPromise.then(function(data)) {}
[17:28:14] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil the idea is that you use .then() for it.
[17:28:41] <Guest1141> when the data is there ur then will run
[17:28:57] <Guest1141> u can also chain .catch
[17:29:18] <Guest1141> so pDataPromise.catch(function(error) {})
[17:29:30] <FishPencil> why is async: flase so bad?
[17:29:36] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[17:29:36] <Guest1141> its lame
[17:29:40] <Guest1141> not even fun
[17:29:43] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[17:29:56] <robertmaxrees> if you turn off async, the JS engine has to stop and wait for the data to come back from the server.
[17:30:02] <robertmaxrees> ie the page freezes.
[17:30:08] <Guest1141> y do u want to do borning stuff?
[17:30:22] <robertmaxrees> network connections can take a really long time to finish, or never finish at all.
[17:30:25] <robertmaxrees> which breaks stuff.
[17:30:28] <FishPencil> robertmaxrees: it has to wait for the first promise to complete anyway
[17:30:35] <Guest1141> no
[17:30:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:30:46] <Guest1141> also all requests  are run in paralel
[17:30:46] <robertmaxrees> the browser doesn't freeze with promises.
[17:31:03] <robertmaxrees> the engine will invoke the promise when it's done, but it doesn't block anything.
[17:31:04] <Guest1141> so u can make all ajaxes at once
[17:31:20] <Guest1141> the data comes back at different time
[17:31:24] <Guest1141> tho
[17:31:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:31:31] <Guest1141> whenever it finishes
[17:31:37] <FishPencil> seems like a lot more work for little benefit but I'll look into it
[17:31:44] <robertmaxrees> it's a huge benefit actually.
[17:31:53] <Guest1141> and its way less work
[17:31:58] <Guest1141> lol
[17:32:02] <Guest1141> but u dont know this yet
[17:32:10] <robertmaxrees> he's just learning.
[17:32:21] <Guest1141> i dont knokw what he is doing
[17:32:37] <robertmaxrees> sure you do - he's asking for help and we're politely helping him do that :)
[17:32:42] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil think of it like this.
[17:32:55] <robertmaxrees> let's say you use async: false and the network connection takes 5 seconds.
[17:33:05] <robertmaxrees> do you really want the page to literally freeze for that duration?
[17:34:39] <Guest1141> FishPencil: better just look at angularjs $http
[17:34:52] <Guest1141> it will help u deal w this
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#giving-good-answers
[17:35:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:35:24] <robertmaxrees> “you should just replace this lib with this completely different framework to solve this one small problem”
[17:35:26] <taplar> the solution to the issue is to adopt a whole new framework?
[17:35:26] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:38:22] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++++
[17:42:32] <taplar> I think my tire is a little low
[17:42:36] <taplar> buy a new car dude
[17:42:54] <taplar> but i just need to learn to use an air compressor
[17:42:59] <taplar> buy the car dude
[17:43:26] <robertmaxrees> but my current car mostly works fine.  just having one small problem with it.
[17:44:30] <robertmaxrees> for some reason I’m reminded of the fallacy that rebuilding new framework == better site.
[17:45:11] <Guest1141> well do you want a new car or not
[17:45:31] <taplar> not really the point
[17:45:35] <robertmaxrees> not if my tire is only a little flat.
[17:45:47] <taplar> a new car, in that situation, is terrible ROI
[17:46:31] <robertmaxrees> I’m not really sure I understand how my suspension works.  Could you help me understand what a leaf spring is?
[17:46:40] <robertmaxrees> JUST USE COILOVERS INSTEAD.
[17:48:40] <Guest1141> id take the new car
[17:48:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:06] <robertmaxrees> how’s everybody’s wednesday?
[17:49:06] <taplar> i'll go for the <$100 compressor
[17:53:25] <Guest1141> whats .stop(true, true)
[17:54:47] <taplar> it stops the animation and clears the queue
[17:56:01] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/stop/ for more reference
[17:56:20] <robertmaxrees> the second true completes the current animation, as well.
[18:09:15] * taplar googles coilovers
[18:09:47] <Guest1141> my car has indpendent coilover w air shoks
[18:10:01] <Guest1141> its like a pillow
[18:10:35] <Guest1141> basicaly wat they put in limos

[18:12:17] <taplar> vanilla method...
[18:12:21] <taplar> wait no
[18:12:28] <Guest1141> coilover is a sprint
[18:12:28] * taplar whistles
[18:12:30] <Guest1141> g
[18:12:35] <Guest1141> dummie
[18:12:54] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:14:20] <Guest1141> or is the spring the flat one
[18:14:46] <taplar> no clue, i already ran that removeAttr command
[18:14:55] <Guest1141> oh yeah leaf spring thats the flat thing
[18:15:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:15:25] <Guest1141> lel
[18:15:32] * Guest1141 farts
[18:15:35] <robertmaxrees> then you get into weird ones like the transverse leaf spring that corvettes use
[18:36:44] <Guest1141> im rent seeking now
[18:37:13] <Guest1141> trying to fix a thing that will be removed soon lol
[18:37:47] <Guest1141> or replaced actauly w something better
[18:39:06] <taplar> huh?
[18:50:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[19:54:48] <hasud> How can i hide the rest tr after 7th ?
[19:57:54] <Guest1141> its impossible
[19:58:09] <Guest1141> nothing can be hidden after 7
[19:58:25] <Guest1141> its gods number
[19:58:29] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[19:58:59] <robertmaxrees> hasud you can use css for that.
[19:59:08] <robertmaxrees> hassoon https://stackoverflow.com/a/14025791/923919
[19:59:47] <robertmaxrees> err, hasud - bad autocomplete :D
[20:00:43] <hasud> robertmaxrees: example https://jsfiddle.net/2hov9n9a/ i want to hide from 7 to 19 and add a "more" button
[20:01:33] <robertmaxrees> so you want pagination?
[20:01:40] <hasud> robertmaxrees: sort of yeah
[20:01:57] <robertmaxrees> then use a class on the parent element + the css in that SO answer.
[20:03:15] <hasud> robertmaxrees: but how do i show the next 7 ?
[20:03:27] <robertmaxrees> so let’s back up then.
[20:03:40] <robertmaxrees> because you said you “sort of” want pagination, now you’re saying you DO want pagination :)
[20:03:46] <robertmaxrees> why do you want pagination in the first place?
[20:04:20] <hasud> robertmaxrees: yes because i get 40 items in the table so i want to show first 7 after click on button "load more" i will get next 7 and so on
[20:04:37] <robertmaxrees> so that should really be powered server-side.
[20:04:43] <robertmaxrees> and it should control the pagination./
[20:04:55] <robertmaxrees> if your goal is to “load” them.
[20:06:00] <hasud> robertmaxrees: to see the next 7, no need for new call to mysql
[20:06:19] <robertmaxrees> i’m super confused about why you’re doing client-side pagination.
[20:06:41] <robertmaxrees> there are a ton of available plugins to handle it for you, though.
[20:07:11] <hasud> robertmaxrees: i get 40 items want to hide 33  of them I want to bind a button to show() the next() + 7 tr's
[20:07:23] <robertmaxrees> and then you want a button to also go back?
[20:07:41] <hasud> robertmaxrees: no, i want the more button on bottom of the end of table again
[20:07:54] <robertmaxrees> ‘kay... that seems really strange lol
[20:08:12] <robertmaxrees> either way, the CSS selector in that SO article will work with jquery.
[20:08:40] <robertmaxrees> just need to store the index in a var and then add whatever number each time you click the “more” button.
[20:11:09] <hasud> robertmaxrees: is there a way to count +7 on button click tr:nth-child(n+10) {
[20:11:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah - you store the index in a var instead.
[20:11:43] <robertmaxrees> and then increment that +7 on click, after you show/hide w/e you want.
[20:13:11] <hasud> robertmaxrees: how can i set tr:nth-child(n+10) with jquery line ?
[20:15:20] <robertmaxrees> ‘tr:nth-child(n+’ + someVarName + ‘)’
[20:15:33] <robertmaxrees> you store that index in a var and then increment it
[20:16:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery selectors are just strings.
[20:22:04] <hasud> robertmaxrees: why doesnt it update can you check https://jsfiddle.net/2hov9n9a/1/
[20:23:33] <robertmaxrees> you never show the elements that were hidden.
[20:24:28] <hasud> robertmaxrees: correct after clicking more it most update defaultNumber = defaultNumber + 5 	$(".table tr:gt(" + defaultNumber + ")").hide();
[20:24:52] <robertmaxrees> bro.
[20:24:55] <robertmaxrees> you hide things.
[20:25:00] <robertmaxrees> bvutr when do you show them?
[20:25:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2hov9n9a/3/
[20:25:23] <robertmaxrees> not perfect nor bug-free.
[20:25:26] <robertmaxrees> but a start.
[21:36:42] <Guest1141> no
[21:56:44] <phelix> $('.sort').click(function() {  setTimeout(doAjax('hi'), interval);  })
[21:57:11] <phelix> Trying to pass data to my function doAjax.. I keep getting unexpected token . error when trying to get that data sent to the doAjax function
[21:57:15] <phelix> Any ideas what I am missing?
[23:03:33] <Cork> phelix: setTimeout(function() { doAjax('hi') }, interval)
[23:04:14] <Cork> phelix: when you do func(functionName) you pass the function by name, if you add () you execute it and pass the return value
[23:04:46] <Cork> phelix: so you need to use an anonymous wrapper function
