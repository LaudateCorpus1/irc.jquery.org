[00:05:58] <DexDeadly> so heres my jfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/b6sc17x6/3/  I have an issue where every time I run this function my success box comes up that many times.  How can I avoid this
[00:06:10] <DexDeadly> sorry
[01:18:48] <compact> ok. is it quicker for PHP to make a string, and store in array so jquery just renders, or should i create a jquery to create the link once the data is loaded?
[01:33:43] <compact> ?
[01:50:14] <BenderRodriguez> compact: the latter means you're making your web logic dependent on JS
[01:50:20] <BenderRodriguez> no graceful degredation
[01:50:29] <BenderRodriguez> that's why I stay away from single-page JS apps
[02:58:30] <hellyeah> i try to put triangle to the  top of tooltiop but sometimes triangle appears under the square element how can i fix that http://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/52/
[03:12:00] <wa5ted> hellyeah: whats happening?
[03:12:12] <wa5ted> it looksf ient o me
[03:12:15] <wa5ted> any specific browser?
[03:12:39] <hellyeah> chrome
[03:12:57] <hellyeah> ops
[03:13:00] <hellyeah> just a sec
[03:13:04] <hellyeah> i forgot updating it
[03:13:51] <hellyeah> wa5ted: correct one http://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/59/
[03:14:09] <hellyeah> i just want to put trinangle same place however big square is
[03:15:00] <wa5ted> hellyeah: how is hover controlled? css or js
[03:15:12] <wa5ted> a square that goes to the width of the content
[03:15:41] <wa5ted> it seems that if the content exceeds the width fo the box the arrow is fine, else its not
[03:15:43] <hellyeah> hover
[03:15:49] <hellyeah> i use jquery tooltip
[03:17:14] <hellyeah> ic
[03:17:29] <hellyeah> wa5ted: but square can have big or small according to content
[03:17:37] <wa5ted> right
[03:17:41] <hellyeah> triangle is in same place i can understand this
[03:17:42] <wa5ted> isntead of setting width of container
[03:17:46] <hellyeah> but i have to arrange it
[03:17:46] <wa5ted> set min width maybe?
[03:17:49] <wa5ted> width to 100%
[03:18:02] <hellyeah> min-width: 100%;
[03:18:07] <hellyeah> ,s that what you mean
[03:18:32] <wa5ted> oh i understand, cause the longer content is 2 lines
[03:19:00] <hellyeah> i used break-word for braking word to new lines
[03:19:04] <hellyeah> is that the problem?
[03:20:39] <wa5ted> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/61/
[03:20:48] <wa5ted> pos: relative on parent element
[03:21:04] <wa5ted> on the :after triangle styling used top property
[03:21:17] <wa5ted> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/61/#&togetherjs=MfTBKdC5PV
[03:21:22] <wa5ted> join me i show you
[03:21:57] <hellyeah> okey i am in that link pls show me
[03:24:35] <hellyeah> wa5ted: but the problem is
[03:24:41] <hellyeah> content exceed the square
[03:24:45] <hellyeah> i cannot allow  that
[03:24:50] <hellyeah> i have to break the word
[03:24:57] <hellyeah> because i have to show all content
[03:25:05] <hellyeah> i guess i need to use break-word in css
[03:26:19] <hellyeah> wa5ted: i joined session
[03:26:28] <wa5ted> i see
[03:32:48] <wa5ted> hellyeah: hope i helped?
[03:32:53] <wa5ted> the tooltip stuff is a bit buggy
[03:33:20] <hellyeah> yes
[03:33:24] <hellyeah> you helped
[03:33:30] <hellyeah> what do you mean "buggy"
[03:33:39] <hellyeah> i mean
[03:33:43] <hellyeah> what bug tooltip has
[03:33:54] <hellyeah> do i need to write tooltip from mm scratch
[03:33:54] <wa5ted> hellyeah: when you hover, the position of the tooltip is inconsistent
[03:33:55] <hellyeah> ?
[03:34:07] <wa5ted> might be the div you are targetting for the tooltip to activate
[03:34:09] <hellyeah> ic
[03:57:35] <stan_man_can> Hey all, Anyone know why on www.villagespizza.xyz the first image of the slider doesn't show up on mobile devices until you click the menu or the image changes.
[04:35:18] <P3nnyw1se> <script src="Scripts/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>    -->    SourceMap C:\Users\ap0549\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\WebSites\Internservice\Scripts\jquery.min.map read failed: Could not find file
[04:35:33] <wa5ted> ?????
[04:35:36] <P3nnyw1se> why does this happen? .. it looks for jquery.min.map.. which doesn't exist.. but 2.1.4 does
[04:35:42] <P3nnyw1se> its an exception I get
[04:35:56] <wa5ted> ddi you try to see if that file exists
[04:36:25] <wa5ted> guesisng here, but / vs \
[04:36:26] <P3nnyw1se> as I said.. I reference in my head... jquery-2.1.4.min  ... which does exist in the folder
[04:36:27] <wa5ted> maybe?
[04:36:31] <P3nnyw1se> jquery-2.1.4.min
[04:36:34] <P3nnyw1se> does however
[04:36:40] <wa5ted> okay
[04:36:40] <P3nnyw1se> which is the one it is suppose to look for
[04:36:44] <wa5ted> well is the map being generated?
[04:37:27] <P3nnyw1se> yes .. I got both the jquery-2.1.4.min and the jquery-2.1.4.min.map
[04:37:30] <P3nnyw1se> in the folder
[04:37:42] <P3nnyw1se> but it keeps checking for it without version number
[04:40:14] <wa5ted> hmm no idea
[04:40:54] <P3nnyw1se> isn't it suppose to go ask for the 2.1.4.min.map ?
[04:40:57] <P3nnyw1se> and not just min.map
[04:41:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:41:46] <hellyeah> why do you jump somewhere else after appearing firs time
[04:41:49] <hellyeah> this is the bug
[04:41:51] <hellyeah> ?
[04:42:01] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/h9e3u10n/4/
[04:42:41] <wa5ted> P3nnyw1se: try renaming the base jquery file without min and see
[04:42:58] <hellyeah> wa5ted: this is the bug you meantioned right
[04:44:03] <hellyeah> sometimes it is not happening
[04:44:06] <wa5ted> hellyeah:  btw object-fit doesnt work for everything check browser compatibility
[04:44:28] <hellyeah> okey
[04:44:58] <wa5ted> hellyeah: i have no idea what you did with your tooltips
[04:45:01] <wa5ted> you added something
[04:45:10] <wa5ted> i see an animation change
[04:45:17] <wa5ted> and the position has changed
[04:45:49] <wa5ted> hellyeah: did you integrate the tooltip into the dom?
[04:46:22] <wa5ted> hellyeah: its cause you used jquery to position it
[04:46:48] <hellyeah> not yer i try to understand howto fix position issue
[04:47:35] <wa5ted> do you have to use jquery tooltip?
[04:47:43] <wa5ted> i mean its up to you but i need to udnerstand the constraints
[04:48:19] <hellyeah> i have jquery tooltip
[04:48:27] <wa5ted> i know, but do you have to use it
[04:49:29] <wa5ted> hellyeah: shall i give you a hint
[04:49:38] <wa5ted> i sort of figured it out
[04:49:55] <wa5ted> take a look at the js in this fiddle
[04:49:56] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/h9e3u10n/7/
[04:50:03] <wa5ted> specifically the tooltip and find the diff.
[04:50:08] <wa5ted> ceterizine: yo
[04:50:47] <hellyeah> thank you
[04:50:50] <wa5ted> P3nnyw1se: any luck?
[04:50:57] <wa5ted> hellyeah: do you understand where the mistake is?
[04:51:52] <hellyeah> i will check it
[04:51:52] <P3nnyw1se> no  not really tried uninstalling jquery and jquery UI .. and added it agian... I made sure I reference the 2.1.4.min   in my <head> and I don't script anything untill after the body
[04:52:04] <P3nnyw1se> oh and btw.. my jquery UI works..
[04:52:34] <wa5ted> P3nnyw1se: since the file is local and not from cdn, did you try renaming file
[04:52:37] <wa5ted> without.min
[04:53:14] <P3nnyw1se> I tried renaming it  from jquery-2.1.4.min.map .. to jquery.min.map .. which is what it says it is looking for.. then my site errored on run
[04:53:20] <P3nnyw1se> this is from my <head>
[04:53:23] <P3nnyw1se>  <script src="Scripts/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>     <script src="Scripts/jquery-ui-1.11.4.min.js"></script>
[04:53:45] <wa5ted> did you try to get rid of the .min part?
[04:54:38] <P3nnyw1se> so just jquery-2.1.4.map ?
[05:00:48] <wa5ted> P3nnyw1se: worth a shot?
[05:01:15] <P3nnyw1se> done it . not working.. mmmmmmmmmmmm I dont get this at all

[05:03:51] <wa5ted> P3nnyw1se:  ^ since you said issue is in visual studio
[05:05:49] <P3nnyw1se> maybe I'm just stupid but when I right click my .. min.map .. I don't get a 'properties'
[05:06:55] <wa5ted> lol
[05:06:56] <wa5ted> idk
[05:06:59] <wa5ted> google around
[05:07:03] <wa5ted> its probably somewhere there
[05:20:26] <P3nnyw1se> ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[05:27:49] <P3nnyw1se> can someone help me understand what is wrong.   I install pluging jquery.2.1.4 ... i reference the .min.js file in my <head> ..  I debug in IE .. and It tells me it cannot find the file 'website/scripts/jquery.min.map' .. which is true.. it isn't there.. but jquery-2.1.4.min.map is!
[05:43:29] <stan_man_can> P3nnyw1se, rename jquery-2.1.4.min.map to jquery.min.map or edit the jquery file to point to the proper minmap
[05:44:15] <P3nnyw1se> tried changing the jquery-2.1.4.min.js  in the comment .. sourceMapping with version name instead of without that didn't change anything thouogh
[05:44:33] <stan_man_can> I personally just remove the reference to the minmap
[05:44:59] <stan_man_can> it's helpful for debugging though
[05:45:23] <stan_man_can> although i've never needed it
[05:46:51] <P3nnyw1se> changed file name.. gave me this now : Unsupported format of the sourcemapException was thrown at line 2,
[05:47:00] <P3nnyw1se> pff.. gonna try and completely remove the reference
[05:47:31] <P3nnyw1se> and we agree its this right? : .'//# sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map
[05:47:38] <P3nnyw1se> this is the line I'm removing
[06:39:33] <tbb__> hi all, please could someone take a look here -> http://jsfiddle.net/ocymb0su/
[06:41:36] <tbb__> what i am trying to achieve is add a div around the first block of my rows if the column count is less than 5
[06:53:55] <hellyeah> wa5ted: still there?
[08:18:46] <zcserei> Hello! How can I switch classes on a ".red" element, so that when it also has .blue the .blue will be replaced by .green, and vice versa? That is, I want to select an element by a given class, and on click I want to switch between two classes? (I am actually using this to toggle between fa-checked and fa-ban icon for an enabled/disabled toggle and I'm selecting the .enabled_domain and .disabled_domain classes, respectively)
[08:20:06] <taplar> you can do it a couple ways
[08:20:42] <taplar> you could bind on an initial class and in the handler check which class it has to know which one to remove and which one to add
[08:20:50] <wa5ted> zcserei: create a fiddle, attempt it and we can help
[08:20:53] <taplar> or you could delegate bind both classes on a parent element
[08:22:17] <zcserei> wa5ted: https://jsfiddle.net/ryacgwpn/
[08:23:25] <zcserei> I actually know what's wrong, when the icons get changed it is position_enabled that holds the .fa-ban and .text-error classes so it's no wonder they are not changing back. On a first click they work okay, you can disable the enabled items and vice versa, but this should be a toggle sort of functionality.
[08:23:48] <tbb__> how can i get rid of the td classes for any tr which contains a span with a specific text
[08:23:49] <tbb__> https://jsfiddle.net/xdf3c7ad/1/
[08:25:05] <taplar> tbb__:so if a span has ! you want to remove all classes from all tds?
[08:25:23] <taplar> or just the parent td?
[08:25:52] <tbb__> in my case on jsfiddle link, the first two rows
[08:26:16] <taplar> so all tds in the row?
[08:26:59] <zcserei> Should I just select .enable_disable_toggle and do a conditional inside the function with hasClass maybe?
[08:27:03] <tbb__> only the last td which contains a specific class (ah and i forgot to mention the td is hidden)
[08:29:57] <zcserei> Okay, the hasClass conditional works
[08:31:41] <taplar> tbb__: https://jsfiddle.net/xdf3c7ad/2/
[08:31:59] <dan_j> Hi. If I've got <div title="something">, how can I change the 'something' using jquery?
[08:32:14] <wa5ted> dan_j: attr or .prop
[08:32:15] <dan_j> <div id="thisthing" title="something">
[08:32:31] <wa5ted> dan_j: look into those two
[08:32:32] <dan_j> thanks
[08:32:41] <wa5ted> idk if attr has been deprecated?
[08:33:03] <taplar> not sure.  prop is preferred though
[08:37:08] <tuskkk___> I have a form inside a bootstrap modal, on pressing enter, the form gets submitted, how to prevent that?
[08:37:54] <taplar> iirc you'll need to attach a keypress or keydown event to the inputs and cancel the keypress on enter
[08:39:13] <tbb__> thx taplar, that helped
[08:39:20] <taplar> cool
[09:24:40] <hellyeah> hey there

[09:29:37] <huncho> hi, i've a problem with jquery
[09:29:46] <hellyeah> what problem
[09:29:54] <wa5ted> hellyeah: you died on me?
[09:30:00] <wa5ted> jphase: :)
[09:30:19] <hellyeah> i suppose it was for wa5ted
[09:30:21] <hellyeah> xD
[09:30:22] <huncho> $(window).bind("load", function(event)
[09:30:24] <jphase> mornin'
[09:30:28] <huncho> i'm using this
[09:30:32] <wa5ted> i havent seen you in ages
[09:30:35] <hellyeah> wa5ted: you died on me
[09:30:40] <hellyeah> what does that mean
[09:30:43] <Guest74133> hi, while using datatable in responsive mode, there is a missmatch between the and td
[09:30:54] <jphase> $(window).on('load', function() {  });
[09:30:57] <wa5ted> huncho:  having a problem with jquery is a very vague statement, and not accurate,, you have a problem with the library?
[09:31:08] <jphase> don't use .bind, and when you pass the param I don't believe it's the event on the window load event
[09:31:16] <hellyeah> wa5ted: do you know drag and drop stuff
[09:31:17] <hellyeah> ?
[09:31:25] <wa5ted> hellyeah: well i was out late, and when i got back you were no where, i literally waited entire night (i had other work but still)
[09:31:39] <hellyeah> wa5ted: i am sorry
[09:31:47] <wa5ted> its okay
[09:31:51] <huncho> @wa5ted i'll put the link to stackoverflow
[09:32:01] <hellyeah> wa5ted: this is what i do http://jsfiddle.net/h9e3u10n/16/
[09:32:16] <hellyeah> wa5ted: it was launch time
[09:32:40] <wa5ted> hellyeah: simplify and clean the ui a tad
[09:32:51] <wa5ted> thin ksimple
[09:32:52] <hellyeah> tad?
[09:32:58] <wa5ted> a bit
[09:33:08] <hellyeah> are you talking about tooltip right
[09:33:09] <wa5ted> take a lok at tooltip designs on dribbble
[09:33:11] <hellyeah> ?
[09:33:12] <wa5ted> or something
[09:33:18] <wa5ted> you night get inspired
[09:33:21] <wa5ted> inspired
[09:33:44] <hellyeah> many design template here
[09:33:55] <wa5ted> well pick one that you like try to make it in css
[09:35:11] <hellyeah> okey
[09:35:16] <hellyeah> i try to do that
[09:35:24] <hellyeah> do you know drag and drop stuff?
[09:36:43] <wa5ted> hellyeah: for somethign like that you can use jquery ui
[09:36:47] <wa5ted> to make your life easier
[09:36:49] <wa5ted> and yes i have
[09:37:37] <hellyeah> i have one question
[09:37:49] <taplar> hellyeah:your not hitting your target
[09:37:50] <wa5ted> and whats that
[09:38:19] <taplar> when you create your second ul element and move the li's into it, their width isn't 100% of the container like they are originally
[09:38:23] <taplar> so your drop is not firing
[09:38:28] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/48/ you can drag and drop button onto another button and div will be created. But when you drag and drop button into created div. Button is not appended to that div how can i solve that? Can you help me to figure out?
[09:38:51] <hellyeah> my drop is not firing
[09:39:10] <hellyeah> so should i fix css?
[09:39:36] <taplar> if your only going to allow them to drag down, your going to have to extend your lis
[09:40:15] <hellyeah> btw
[09:40:23] <hellyeah> something different happened look http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/49/
[09:40:43] <hellyeah> when you try to append third element into same div
[09:40:49] <hellyeah> new div is created
[09:41:04] <hellyeah> hmm may be it is because of i created droppable div insidr drop function
[09:41:07] <taplar> your creating a new ul each time
[09:41:12] <taplar> regardless of if one already existed
[09:41:18] <hellyeah> i understand that
[09:41:47] <hellyeah> let me try something
[09:41:52] <taplar> and side note, your rewrapping div2 all over the place
[09:43:30] <hellyeah> it is an improvement
[09:43:34] <hellyeah> take a look http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/50/
[09:43:47] <hellyeah> i created droppablediv in html part
[09:43:55] <hellyeah> but now there is a new issue
[09:44:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:44:07] <wa5ted> hellyeah: what are you trying to accomplish
[09:44:08] <wa5ted> two rows
[09:44:17] <wa5ted> by which stuff from rwo 1 can be dropped on rwo 2?
[09:44:17] <hellyeah> well let me try to explain
[09:44:30] <hellyeah> this link is working as i expected
[09:44:32] <hellyeah> except
[09:44:44] <hellyeah> if you drag button onto another button new div will be created
[09:44:54] <hellyeah> in that link all button seems in the same div
[09:45:02] <hellyeah> like a drop onto b
[09:45:05] <hellyeah> a b
[09:45:23] <hellyeah> c drop onto div that contains a b what i see is a b c
[09:45:26] <hellyeah> it works good
[09:45:45] <hellyeah> but when i drop d onto e new div will be created that contains d and e
[09:46:07] <taplar> so, you went from always creating a new one
[09:46:10] <taplar> to never
[09:46:12] <taplar> :/
[09:46:14] <taplar> lol
[09:46:25] <hellyeah> it will create one time
[09:46:28] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:46:31] <taplar> it's not
[09:46:35] <taplar> it's selecting the one on the page
[09:46:41] <wa5ted> taplar: i pray you are as confused as i am right now
[09:46:53] <wa5ted> otherwise im just a dumbass
[09:47:03] <taplar> i know what he's after.  he's just going from one extreme to another
[09:47:12] <hellyeah> it is created
[09:47:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:47:20] <hellyeah> ic
[09:47:25] <taplar> $('.droppablediv')
[09:47:27] <hellyeah> one extreme to another
[09:47:32] <taplar> that is selecting the existing one
[09:47:44] <taplar> logically what your wanting to do is create one if they do not belong to a droppablediv
[09:47:53] <taplar> otherwise if they do, you just add the new one to it
[09:48:27] <hellyeah> sounds like i need to check with if is that correct?
[09:48:33] <taplar> yup yup
[09:49:11] <hellyeah> if the element i drop onto is in droppable div
[09:49:16] <hellyeah> append to droppablediv
[09:49:20] * wa5ted lets taplar deal with hellyeah 's situation while he floats in the background
[09:49:20] <hellyeah> else do something else
[09:49:27] <taplar> yup
[09:50:09] <hellyeah> he floats in the background i dont understand that part sorry for my english
[09:51:16] <hellyeah> i guess i need to check an element is inside another element
[09:51:22] <hellyeah> does jquery have a function for that
[09:51:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:51:28] <hellyeah> ah
[09:51:45] <hellyeah> this.find('.droppablediv')  === true
[09:51:47] <taplar> various ways.  i'd probably go with closest().length
[09:52:17] <hellyeah> this.closest().length !== 0
[09:52:24] <hellyeah> ops
[09:52:27] <taplar> giving closest the class selector
[09:52:29] <hellyeah> let me try
[09:52:54] <hellyeah> this.closest('droppablediv').length !== 0
[09:53:08] <hellyeah> .droppablediv
[09:53:08] <taplar> missing your '.'
[09:53:16] <hellyeah> i realized :D
[09:55:19] <taplar> and actually you could leave off the !== 0 part.  Non zero is truthy
[09:55:23] <hellyeah> taplar: am i doing smt wrong here  42-51
[09:55:47] <hellyeah> what doees leave off mean
[09:55:54] <hellyeah> btrw jsfiddle is http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/51/
[09:56:06] <taplar> leave off == remove
[09:56:18] <hellyeah> i needed to make sure
[09:56:44] <hellyeah> so $(this).closest('.droppablediv').length return true or false
[09:56:54] <hellyeah> non zero is truthy ic
[09:57:16] <hellyeah> but new div is not created http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/52/
[09:57:42] <taplar> your creating it in your logic
[09:57:48] <taplar> but then...
[09:58:17] <taplar> basically you had your creation logic at the start of this conversation
[09:58:25] <taplar> then you created your existing logic towards the end
[09:58:34] <taplar> now you need both managed by the if
[10:01:15] <hellyeah> taplar: like this http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/53/
[10:01:26] <hellyeah> no
[10:02:05] <taplar> hah, didn't mean to do that.  closed my stupid window, heh
[10:02:06] <hellyeah> can you give me some code tips
[10:02:16] <taplar> can you link again?
[10:02:17] <hellyeah> :XD
[10:02:19] <hellyeah> sure
[10:02:28] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/53/
[10:03:03] <taplar> hellyeah:look back at your earlier fiddles where you were creating your uls
[10:04:48] <hellyeah> taplar: it was like that http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/56/
[10:05:22] <taplar> there was more to it
[10:05:29] <taplar> go back and look at them
[10:08:08] <taplar> actually before you do that, you need to fix your existing logic
[10:08:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:08:22] <taplar> your checking if the element belongs to that class
[10:08:32] <taplar> but then your doing a global lookup for that class to append to it
[10:08:36] <Twirl> hey guys, anyone using dropzone.js?
[10:08:37] <taplar> is that really what you want?
[10:09:47] <hellyeah> no actually
[10:10:02] <hellyeah> the button i drag onto div has a button
[10:10:40] <hellyeah> hmm i may not make sense
[10:11:00] <hellyeah> i want to check if the button  is in droppablediv
[10:11:10] <hellyeah> but that doesnt make sense it seems
[10:11:12] <taplar> in A 'droppablediv'
[10:11:18] <taplar> there will be multiple
[10:11:24] <hellyeah> yes
[10:11:28] <taplar> so if it is
[10:11:40] <taplar> then you want to put it in THAT 'droppablediv'
[10:12:09] <taplar> $('droppablediv') gets ALL of them
[10:12:20] <taplar> missing the '.', but you get me
[10:12:26] <hellyeah> ye,
[10:12:30] <hellyeah> i got you
[10:13:00] <hellyeah> but i dont have any clue how to fix that can youı give me some hints?
[10:13:12] <hellyeah> pls
[10:13:16] <taplar> how did you get it to check if it exists?
[10:13:31] <hellyeah> droppable div exist
[10:13:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:13:39] <hellyeah> i could use find,
[10:13:45] <taplar> no, find goes down
[10:13:50] <taplar> you already did it in your if
[10:14:11] <hellyeah> if okey droppablediv length is 1
[10:14:19] <hellyeah> if droppable div length is 1
[10:14:34] <hellyeah> it means droppable div exist
[10:14:39] <taplar> yep
[10:14:57] <taplar> tell me what that statement is doing
[10:15:11] <hellyeah> but using $(this) make sense i am not sure
[10:15:40] <hellyeah> does that make sense
[10:15:50] <taplar> explain to me what the if conditional is doin
[10:15:56] <taplar> *doing
[10:16:07] <hellyeah> i am in drop
[10:16:12] <taplar> just the if
[10:16:17] <hellyeah> so i drag button onto drop
[10:16:18] <hellyeah> okey
[10:16:21] <hellyeah> here we go
[10:16:36] <hellyeah> if button is in droppablediv then add this button to that div
[10:16:50] <taplar> ok, that's descriptive
[10:16:55] <taplar> but tell me what the operations are doing
[10:17:01] <hellyeah> does it understandable
[10:17:21] <taplar> explain to me how your doing that
[10:17:39] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:17:47] <hellyeah> i will drag button onto that area
[10:17:50] <taplar> no
[10:17:51] <taplar> stop
[10:17:53] <taplar> the if
[10:18:03] <taplar> $(this).closest('.droppablediv').length
[10:18:06] <taplar> what is that doing
[10:18:19] <hellyeah> it check if there is a droppablediv or not
[10:18:24] <taplar> now?
[10:18:25] <taplar> how?
[10:18:43] <taplar> i want to make sure you understand what this is doing
[10:18:51] <hellyeah> .length returns an anwer 0 or other then 0
[10:18:59] <taplar> start at the front
[10:19:03] <hellyeah> taplar: thanks for patience
[10:19:17] <taplar> what is 'this' ?
[10:19:23] <hellyeah> okey
[10:19:37] <hellyeah> this is a button which is already dropped in a droppable div?
[10:19:42] <taplar> ok
[10:19:48] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[10:19:48] <taplar> what are you doing with it?
[10:20:13] <taplar> yes
[10:20:17] <hellyeah> i will pick a button and get the closest droppable div
[10:20:22] <taplar> a button?
[10:20:36] <hellyeah> droppablediv contains button
[10:20:41] <wa5ted> any luck boys?
[10:20:43] <taplar> not a button.  THE button
[10:20:50] <taplar> the one that was dropped
[10:20:54] <hellyeah> sorry The button  yeah
[10:21:01] <hellyeah> my english failure :)
[10:21:15] <taplar> so your getting the closest droppable div
[10:21:15] <hellyeah> this symbolize the button in the droppablediv
[10:21:26] <hellyeah> yeah i am getting closest droppable div
[10:21:31] <taplar> so you have it
[10:21:34] <hellyeah> if there is any droppablediv around
[10:21:40] <hellyeah> .length will return 1
[10:21:46] <taplar> you could do anything with it
[10:22:00] <taplar> like append or remove, or add a class.  whatever
[10:22:00] <hellyeah> so if it will return 1
[10:22:10] <hellyeah> i jkust add button thjat i drag into droppablediv
[10:22:44] <taplar> so you know how to change that part now?
[10:24:30] <hellyeah> taplar: i am sorry but can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/59/
[10:25:05] <taplar> your still appending to a global lookup of the droppablediv
[10:25:28] <hellyeah> what does global lookup mean?
[10:25:47] <taplar> finding all elements in the entire dom
[10:26:07] <hellyeah> ic
[10:26:18] <taplar> you only want to append to the droppablediv the li exists to
[10:26:24] <hellyeah> ah in if
[10:26:30] <taplar> yes, in the true case
[10:27:04] <hellyeah> can i do
[10:27:16] <hellyeah> this.parent() === 'droppablediv' instead of closest
[10:27:25] <taplar> why?
[10:27:31] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:27:41] <taplar> what did we just talk about in explaining the if
[10:27:48] <hellyeah> i just asked i dont know how to handle this global lookup
[10:28:13] <hellyeah> damn
[10:28:30] <hellyeah> what is i just look ul
[10:28:35] <hellyeah> closest('ul')
[10:28:38] <hellyeah> is that true?
[10:28:41] <taplar> yes
[10:28:44] <taplar> no
[10:28:46] <taplar> :(
[10:28:57] <taplar> just re-use your closest lookup
[10:28:58] <hellyeah> damn
[10:29:35] <hellyeah> closest('.droppablediv').closest('ul') ?
[10:29:42] <taplar> why do you need the ul?
[10:29:54] <taplar> the ul IS the droppablediv
[10:30:04] <hellyeah> i just try to understand
[10:30:07] <hellyeah> yes
[10:30:16] <hellyeah> closest('.droppablediv')
[10:30:30] <hellyeah> re-use closest lookup
[10:30:36] <taplar> yes
[10:30:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:31:19] <hellyeah> do you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/60/
[10:31:38] <hellyeah> pls ::p
[10:31:45] <taplar> yay!!!
[10:31:54] <hellyeah> ahahah,
[10:32:22] <taplar> 45 is still wrong though
[10:32:23] <hellyeah> i am stupid or i am excited and i should hit my head to the wall sometimes
[10:32:24] <hellyeah> :XD
[10:32:48] <taplar> not sure why your doing ln 45 anyway
[10:32:48] <huncho>  /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER huncho rapacudfjtpp
[10:32:57] <hellyeah> this  one right $('.buttondiv').append($('.droppablediv'));
[10:32:59] <taplar> ohh, change that fast
[10:33:10] <taplar> we saw that huncho
[10:33:28] <wa5ted> lol
[10:33:28] <taplar> hellyeah:yeah
[10:33:33] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/61/
[10:33:36] <hellyeah> i removed it
[10:33:37] <wa5ted> i always do that in the freenode server tab
[10:33:41] <hellyeah> thats not necessary
[10:33:44] <huncho> sorry i'm a beginner
[10:33:45] <wa5ted> to avoid it being seen by others
[10:33:50] <hellyeah> because droppablediv is already in buttondiv
[10:33:56] <hellyeah> i should do that in else
[10:34:04] <hellyeah> or another if
[10:34:33] <hellyeah> huncho: someone can ghost you
[10:34:36] <hellyeah> be careful
[10:34:42] <taplar> hellyeah:ok, i'm thinking your true case is ok.  start working on your else case
[10:34:56] <hellyeah> my else case
[10:34:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:34:58] <huncho> how ?
[10:35:09] <hellyeah> ./ns ghost nickname password
[10:35:15] <taplar> go back and look at your earlier fiddles where you were always creating a new ul
[10:35:24] <hellyeah> taplar: i guess in else i should create div
[10:35:30] <taplar> ul
[10:35:31] <taplar> not div
[10:35:37] <hellyeah> and i should add button that is dragged and drop button on a div
[10:36:02] <hellyeah> okey i am looking at it
[10:37:14] <huncho> hellyeah: jacked
[10:37:31] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/62/
[10:37:50] <hellyeah> does it seem correct?
[10:37:54] <huncho> yes
[10:37:56] <huncho> XD
[10:37:59] <huncho> im huncho
[10:38:05] <huncho> huncho villa XD
[10:38:35] <taplar> hellyeah:your buttons appear to be disappearing
[10:38:43] <hellyeah> yes
[10:38:45] <hellyeah> it disappear
[10:38:52] <hellyeah> it also is not available in dom
[10:38:56] <hellyeah> what does it go?
[10:39:37] <taplar> two things
[10:39:46] <taplar> 1) your not putting the new ul on the page
[10:39:55] <taplar> 2) your doing a global lookup in the else
[10:40:02] <hellyeah> damn
[10:41:00] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/63/
[10:41:09] <hellyeah> i did if instead opf else with !
[10:41:33] <taplar> no, use an else
[10:41:47] <huncho> where is huncho
[10:42:05] <hellyeah> okey
[10:42:17] <hellyeah> he is scared xD
[10:42:35] <hellyeah> taplar: did i do wrong by adding div2
[10:42:41] <firstquery> other than jquery cookbooks are there any sites that list out complex projects or exercises that one can code to enhance jquery skills
[10:43:18] <taplar> firstquery: i'm not aware of any.  personally I've learned -alot- by hanging out in this room
[10:43:26] <taplar> lots of information gets thrown around
[10:43:37] <hellyeah> me too
[10:43:57] <firstquery> agreed, I wish there were one which would be challenging jquery projects that would be monitored by experts. Thanks
[10:44:01] <hellyeah> taplar: any tips
[10:44:11] <taplar> hellyeah:what's your /#?
[10:44:18] <hellyeah> what
[10:44:24] <taplar> what's your latest link?
[10:44:48] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/65/
[10:45:29] <taplar> ok, your still not adding it to the body.  and your still re-wrapping it multiple times
[10:45:40] <taplar> and the global lookup, ~_~
[10:45:45] <hellyeah> i add it to button div
[10:45:49] <hellyeah> global look up
[10:45:53] <taplar> yep
[10:45:58] <taplar> fix those things.
[10:45:58] <hellyeah> yo said, "use else"
[10:46:01] * taplar goes for coffee
[10:46:33] <hellyeah> re wrapping issue got handlled

[11:20:24] <Narhir> hi
[11:20:52] <taplar> greetings
[11:21:48] <wa5ted> beivenue
[11:22:07] <taplar> ohhh, what language is that?
[11:24:03] <Narhir> no idea :D
[11:24:08] <Narhir> but intersting in it as well ;p
[11:24:11] <Narhir> How are you doing taplar ? -.-
[11:24:24] <taplar> fairly well. slow day in the office, :)
[11:24:56] <Narhir> :P
[11:25:03] <Narhir> Good :P you may be able to solve me one mystery than :D
[11:25:06] <Narhir> https://jsfiddle.net/014swjmv/1/
[11:25:13] <Narhir> well actually few mysteries...
[11:25:47] <wa5ted> taplar: my attempt at french
[11:26:10] <taplar> lol, for some reason i was thinking french, but google translate guessed at german
[11:26:13] <Narhir> 1) the "Active" state" is not in the currently clicked li item;/ it only stays in the first item, when I tried to add it to the "click" function it was adding "active" class to every item multiple times -.-
[11:26:18] <wa5ted> Narhir: https://jsfiddle.net/jackrugile/6s2gH/
[11:26:45] <Narhir> wa5ted:  but it is not a dropdown but accordion ?;d
[11:27:17] <wa5ted> Narhir:  i thought we were in the game of sending each other random fiddles without any indication wohat the issue was
[11:27:24] <Narhir> 2) issue is that It currently works by setting widths of items in the JS and this creates issues because I cant make it responsive :(
[11:27:41] <Narhir> wa5ted:  I was writing a descriptive description about my issue..
[11:27:45] <wa5ted> oh
[11:27:50] <Narhir> in multiple points
[11:27:51] <wa5ted> ic
[11:27:55] <Narhir> But thanks for help ;p
[11:28:15] <Narhir> I'm stuck with it since like yesterday so..y eah :/
[11:28:48] <Narhir> 3) at times it is possible to click on same item in almost same time, and than multiple items opens at once....
[11:28:57] <Narhir> wa5ted: could you help me out ?;/
[11:29:01] <Narhir> I'm terrible with jQuery
[11:29:12] <wa5ted> im trying to understand the issue
[11:29:14] <Narhir> and I done it following some Tutorial
[11:29:17] <wa5ted> taplar: you are welcome to pitch in
[11:29:28] <Narhir> taplar:  that would be epic indeed ;p
[11:29:29] <taplar> i'm looking
[11:29:30] <wa5ted> Narhir: in the end what are you trying to build?
[11:29:35] <wa5ted> an accordion right?
[11:29:38] <taplar> in the fiddle though i only see the first li
[11:29:39] <Narhir> yes
[11:29:54] <Narhir> click RUN
[11:29:57] <wa5ted> an accordion that slides out sideways
[11:30:06] <taplar> i did, only see the first one
[11:30:09] <Narhir> and after clicking on "Tier2 " "tier 3" aand so on other content shows up
[11:30:13] <Narhir> hmm
[11:30:19] <Narhir> Taplar make your window wider
[11:30:21] <Narhir> for the html part
[11:30:31] <taplar> ah
[11:30:31] <taplar> lol
[11:30:37] <wa5ted> i was lost too
[11:30:39] <wa5ted> okay makes sense
[11:30:42] <taplar> stupid laptop
[11:30:44] <wa5ted> what else are we missing
[11:30:59] <wa5ted> huncho_: i released your nick so you can switch to 'huncho'
[11:31:02] <Narhir> that is the issue it is not responsive
[11:31:05] <Narhir> and parts of it disapear
[11:31:10] <Narhir> but first is the "active" issue
[11:31:32] <wa5ted> so basically the active li should ahve the tier div to be inverted
[11:31:38] <wa5ted> meaning teh gold color on the background?
[11:31:42] <huncho_> @wa5ted  ok thanks bro
[11:32:06] <Narhir> exactly
[11:32:09] <wa5ted> sorry i jacked it
[11:32:11] <Narhir> but that is only the css part of it
[11:32:11] <wa5ted> for a bit
[11:32:11] <taplar> i don't see where your moving the class
[11:32:19] <Narhir> taplar the problem is
[11:32:22] <Narhir> that the class is not moving
[11:32:28] <Narhir> when I added it to the click function
[11:32:30] <taplar> that's what i'm saying
[11:32:31] <Narhir> wheneverI clicked on it
[11:32:36] <taplar> your putting it on the first one, and never moving it
[11:32:37] <Narhir> it added it multiple times but didnt removed it
[11:32:47] <Narhir> because it was causing errors
[11:32:50] <Narhir> let me re-add it
[11:35:18] <Narhir> https://jsfiddle.net/014swjmv/4/
[11:35:26] <Narhir> now you can see the problem in regards to the "Active"
[11:35:29] <Narhir> in clearer way
[11:35:51] <Narhir> items become active even if they are not active but were clicked previously
[11:37:37] <huncho_> wa5ted: i'm using a js function to sort a table under the event (bind on load) , it desn't work when the content change
[11:38:08] <wa5ted> example
[11:38:10] <wa5ted> sample code pls
[11:38:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/014swjmv/6/
[11:38:36] <huncho_> $(window).bind("load", function(event)      {       event.preventDefault();      //  alert('a');                // sort table --------------------    function sortTable()    {       var tbl = document.getElementById("ttable").tBodies[0];       var store = [];       for(var i=0, len=tbl.rows.length; i<len; i++){           var row = tbl.rows[i];           var sortnr = parseFloat(row.cells[0].textContent || row.cells[0].innerText);    
[11:38:38] <taplar> does the active issue still exist?
[11:38:44] <taplar> please don't paste code in the chatroom
[11:38:46] <taplar> make a fiddle
[11:39:05] <Narhir> epic TAPLAR !!! :D
[11:39:09] <Narhir> taplar++
[11:39:14] <wa5ted> taplar: this one time this guy pasted code inchat, omg it went on for 100 lines
[11:39:16] <Narhir> is here a karma system ?
[11:39:16] <wa5ted> before he realized
[11:39:27] <Narhir> karma?
[11:39:35] <wa5ted> naw
[11:39:39] <Narhir> Thank you taplar :)
[11:39:42] <wa5ted> its just to indicate so
[11:39:42] <Narhir> And now the point 2)
[11:39:46] <taplar> you see what i did?
[11:39:46] <Narhir> How can I make it responsive?
[11:39:50] <Narhir> I saw!
[11:39:55] <taplar> k
[11:40:04] <Narhir> but to be honest
[11:40:09] <Narhir> I dont understand it in 100%
[11:40:13] <taplar> so ask, :)
[11:40:14] <Narhir> you add and remove the class in same time?
[11:40:26] <Narhir> ah you remove it from active item
[11:40:29] <Narhir> but you add it to this item
[11:40:30] <Narhir> hmm
[11:40:38] <taplar> ok, first off i removed the activeElement variable
[11:40:43] <taplar> since you can just look it up
[11:41:04] <taplar> and at the end i just swap the class off of the active onto the new active
[11:41:40] <Narhir> hm
[11:41:41] <Narhir> smart
[11:42:02] <Narhir> :)
[11:42:02] <taplar> also by doing the lookup i feels its a bit safer in the case that a user clicks alot of them really fast
[11:42:03] <Narhir> really
[11:42:11] <Narhir> EXACTLY !
[11:42:14] <Narhir> I had problem with it
[11:42:18] <Narhir> whenever I clicked a lot and really fast
[11:42:23] <Narhir> some of them were disapearing
[11:43:07] <taplar> things can often go wonky when you introduce a stateful variable
[11:43:31] <taplar> so what was your question about responsive?
[11:43:51] <Narhir> currently the width of the "Active" or "inactive" item is defined in the jquery
[11:44:02] <Narhir> But because of that I cant change it with css because jquery is overwriting it
[11:44:15] <Narhir> and I want to be able to change it in order to style it for responsivness
[11:44:23] <Narhir> But I'm not sure if that would be best solution
[11:44:30] <Narhir> is there a way to remove the fixed width and do it with css
[11:44:39] <taplar> ah, the inline styling
[11:44:39] <Narhir> or is there some other method I should consider ?
[11:45:07] <taplar> is that not dependent upon the parent width?
[11:45:17] <Narhir> no
[11:45:33] <Narhir> the javascript have setted up the width of open / close accordion
[11:45:41] <Narhir> but this creates bunch of issues
[11:45:43] <taplar> oh
[11:46:07] <huncho_> wa5ted: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34497356/im-using-sort-table-function-it-doesnt-work-when-content-changes
[11:46:17] <taplar> you might consider responsive font units
[11:46:20] <Narhir> so I cant really make it responsive
[11:46:23] <taplar> such as vw
[11:46:30] <Narhir> vw ?
[11:46:40] <taplar> viewport width
[11:46:47] <taplar> 100vw is 100% of the viewport
[11:46:53] <Narhir> hmm
[11:46:58] <taplar> taking into account resizing
[11:46:58] <Narhir> and it can be used in js ?
[11:47:01] <taplar> sure
[11:47:05] <taplar> it's a css unit
[11:47:10] <huncho_> i've a problem with jQUery can u help ???
[11:47:10] <Narhir> this could be good solution
[11:47:11] <Narhir> but
[11:47:13] <Narhir> in some cases
[11:47:22] <Narhir> I wouldn't want the same aspect ratio
[11:47:25] <robertmaxrees> huncho_ just ask your question.  if somebody can help, they will.
[11:47:29] <Narhir> or it wont fit
[11:47:34] <Narhir> because those are 4 columns :/
[11:47:37] <Narhir> it is quite wide
[11:47:42] <Narhir> in order to make it responsive..
[11:47:44] <taplar> ok, if you wanted to get trickier with it
[11:47:50] <huncho_> robertmaxrees: this is my question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34497356/im-using-sort-table-function-it-doesnt-work-when-content-changes
[11:48:03] <taplar> you could give it a class and then in your css you could change that class definition with media queries
[11:48:11] <robertmaxrees> huncho_ somebody already answered your question.
[11:48:19] <robertmaxrees> huncho_ you call that function once on window load.
[11:48:26] <Narhir> that would be what I would prefer
[11:48:28] <robertmaxrees> huncho_ you'll have to call it again every time you change the table's contents.
[11:48:31] <Narhir> but this didn't worked
[11:48:34] <Narhir> when I done that
[11:48:38] <Narhir> it stopped working
[11:48:43] <taplar> the inline styles are going to take presidence
[11:48:49] <taplar> so you'll have to !important some things
[11:48:56] <robertmaxrees> *most things.
[11:49:01] <taplar> ya
[11:49:06] <Narhir> that is not a problem
[11:49:08] <robertmaxrees> sounds like Narhir is battling a plugin or something?
[11:49:13] <taplar> slider
[11:49:20] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees:  yo
[11:49:20] <Narhir> yeah accordion
[11:49:21] <Narhir> ;p
[11:49:30] <robertmaxrees> sup wa5ted
[11:49:35] <taplar> heh
[11:49:43] <Narhir> however what if I would want it to open from top to bottom ?
[11:49:50] <Narhir> like on mobile devie
[11:49:52] <Narhir> device
[11:49:53] <wa5ted> nm just chilling and flaoting
[11:49:58] <Narhir> I would need to animate height instead of width?
[11:50:07] <Narhir> sorry for silly questions
[11:50:09] <taplar> most likely
[11:50:13] <Narhir> I'm just trying to find best approach
[11:50:16] <Narhir> to make it responsive
[11:50:18] <taplar> and you'd have to change the initial placement to make them stack
[11:50:29] <Narhir> and having the width and height inside it isnt very responsive ?
[11:50:55] <Narhir> so.. you say that I should leave the inline styling and jquery as it is
[11:50:58] <taplar> i'm fairly new to responsiveness, but I've read the best approach is to start on your smallest view and then grow out
[11:51:00] <Narhir> and only do it with csS+  improtant ?
[11:51:24] <taplar> as much as you can do in css, do in css
[11:51:33] <Narhir> the thing that when I tried to do that
[11:51:35] <Narhir> I couldn't hmm
[11:51:39] <taplar> no need to reinvent the wheel
[11:52:29] <taplar> robert's more of a frontend guy than i am.  he probably knows better, :)
[11:52:51] <Narhir> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/014swjmv/7/
[11:52:52] <Narhir> take a look
[11:53:17] <Narhir> I can change the width but it gets wanky animation
[11:53:36] <taplar> yeah, that's going to be weird
[11:53:47] <taplar> because the animate is incrementally changing it to do the slide
[11:53:55] <taplar> but your overriding it
[11:54:25] <Narhir> so.. it wont work in that way :/
[11:54:39] <taplar> seems no, :(
[11:55:09] <Narhir> or I will jsut remove the js animation
[11:55:12] <Narhir> and stick with css 3 transitions
[11:55:34] <robertmaxrees> *css transitions.  there's really no more versioning for css fwiw.
[11:56:56] <Narhir> https://jsfiddle.net/014swjmv/8/
[11:57:11] <Narhir> css 3 transitions ;p
[11:57:20] <Narhir> ah
[11:57:22] <Narhir> right
[11:57:22] <Narhir> sorry
[11:57:25] <Narhir> css transitions!
[11:57:27] <Narhir> my bad :)
[11:57:33] <robertmaxrees> just like it's not ES6 any more - es2015
[11:57:57] <Narhir> robertmaxrees: do you think it is ok approach to ditch js animation for css one ?
[11:58:11] <robertmaxrees> it's actually preferred to do it via css.
[11:58:14] <robertmaxrees> like, always.
[12:00:28] <sj13> What's the difference between click and onclick functions?
[12:00:35] <Narhir> thanks guys
[12:00:38] <Narhir> you helped me a ton! :)
[12:00:44] <taplar> onclick is the dom attribute
[12:00:49] <taplar> it's outside of jquery
[12:01:06] <taplar> you want click instead of onclick for various reason
[12:01:09] <taplar> *s
[12:01:56] <sj13> So basically onclick is simply fired only when you click on that particular element?
[12:02:11] <taplar> they result in the same result
[12:02:15] <taplar> one has more constraints though
[12:02:57] <taplar> onclick is unable to do delegate binding
[12:03:11] <taplar> also using onclick is a violation of separation of concerns
[12:03:44] <taplar> and also, iirc, you cannot have onclick do multiple things
[12:03:49] <taplar> which is a scalable issue
[12:04:58] <sj13> taplar, in this particular snippet http://pastebin.com/WchNfe9u, what exactly happens when the text is changed to Goodbye and the user clicks on it again?
[12:05:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and see :)
[12:05:40] <taplar> in that snipplet i'm pretty sure that..... it doesn't exist anymore and I can't tell you
[12:07:53] <sj13> robertmaxrees, I ran the code, but I don't understand why it works that way. When the text is changed to goodbye, how is the click event being fired when onclick still specifies the same function to be called when it's clicked.
[12:08:47] <robertmaxrees> sj13 you're replacing the contents of #title, and also ADDING another event handler.
[12:10:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2bpxau4j/ - you want to use .on()/.click(), not the dom onclick attribute.
[12:10:55] <sj13> Why is that event fired when you click the second time?
[12:11:06] <robertmaxrees> *the handler, not the evemt.
[12:11:20] <taplar> why would it not fire?
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> and onclick isn't impacted by .on()/.off().  don't juggle handlers anyway.
[12:11:41] <taplar> remember when i said onclick is outside jquery? ;)
[12:13:09] * taplar decides it's time to zombie walk down to the bistro while saying "fooooooood"
[12:14:08] <robertmaxrees> sj13 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2bpxau4j/1/ do something like this instead.  even better, hide/show things or use classes.
[12:14:48] <sj13> So when it's clicked for the first time, the handler isn't exited, then when the user clicks the second time, the click is run and then that handler is removed immediately as well, hence the when clicked again, the function is called. Is this correct?
[12:15:20] <robertmaxrees> Err.
[12:15:24] <robertmaxrees> you have two handlers.
[12:15:41] <robertmaxrees> the first one is always fired - sayGoodbye is fired every time you click that element.
[12:16:05] <robertmaxrees> the first time you click it, you also bind a second handler - the one inside that .click()
[12:16:39] <robertmaxrees> the second time you click that element, you fire sayGoodbye again, which also binds that second handler AND runs it from the last time it was bound.
[12:16:54] <robertmaxrees> when that second handler runs, it removes itself.
[12:17:20] <relipse> how do I correctly incorporate css into my jqueyr
[12:17:32] <relipse> plugin
[12:17:33] <robertmaxrees> that sentence makes no sense relipse :)
[12:17:46] <relipse> i'm just wondering how to deal with my css
[12:17:50] <relipse> that goes with my plugin
[12:18:06] <robertmaxrees> oh, add a stylesheet and require that people include it.
[12:20:01] <sj13> robertmaxrees, on the first click how's it bound but not executed? I don't understand the alternating behaviour.
[12:20:48] <robertmaxrees> $("#title").click(function () { only  binds thing.
[12:20:57] <robertmaxrees> *things - it doesn't run the handler inside of it.
[12:21:25] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:21:57] <robertmaxrees> aaaaand back.
[12:24:20] <robertmaxrees> sj13 basically, the code you had doesn't really make sense.
[12:24:59] <sj13> robertmaxrees, so what about the  $("#title").off("click"); during the first click? Since there is no handler, there is nothing to remove? And on the second click, where and how exactly is the event fired since you said everything inside click() is responsible for binding and not running.
[12:25:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:25:17] <robertmaxrees> that part doesn't run on the first click.
[12:25:22] <sj13> It confused me so much, robertmaxrees :/
[12:25:51] <robertmaxrees> you're basically overthinking it.
[12:25:52] <robertmaxrees> back up a tick.
[12:26:13] <sj13> Basically the flow of control isn't making sense in my head at all.
[12:26:17] <robertmaxrees> the first time sayGoodbye runs, it changes the html inside an element and adds a jquery event handler.
[12:26:35] <robertmaxrees> anything inside of $("#title").click(function () { doesn't run yet because that hasn't been bound.
[12:29:04] <taplar_lunch> lol, part of a tree on our campus just feel off and almost took out a van
[12:29:10] <robertmaxrees> nice
[12:29:32] <taplar_lunch> knew i came in today for a reason
[12:29:54] <sj13> okay, robertmaxrees, thanks :)
[12:30:07] <robertmaxrees> sj13 understainding now? :)
[12:31:08] <sj13> Yes, certainly makes more sense. Any specific resource I can use to gain more insight about these things in particular? Just a beginner.
[12:31:38] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a good tutorial, though it won't necessarily cover mixing jquery and native event binding.
[12:31:54] <robertmaxrees> it'll just cover jquery event binding - there are some small distinctions.
[12:32:43] <sj13> Alright, I will go through it.
[12:33:08] <sj13> Also, what's the difference between $('css_selector') and document.getElement....('css_selector')?
[12:33:26] <robertmaxrees> there's no  document.getElement....('css_selector') for starters.
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> i think you mean querySelector or querySelectorAll
[12:34:21] <robertmaxrees> and there's a hude difference.
[12:34:26] <sj13> No, I meant document.getElementById() or using tag or class name
[12:34:45] <km4> hi
[12:35:05] <km4> have this problem in Chrome http://jsbin.com/wapifefoja/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[12:35:08] <robertmaxrees> for starters, getElementsByClassName isn't supported in IE 8 or lower.
[12:35:34] <robertmaxrees> sj13 but also, $() returns a jquery object, which means you get a bunch of methods and properties you don't have on raw DOM nodes.
[12:36:11] <taplar_lunch> km4:what's the problem?
[12:36:45] <km4> look console
[12:37:01] <km4> In and out the same time if I move mouse into nav
[12:37:17] <sj13> That;s pretty much what I gathered -- $() returns a jquery object so all jquery methods can be called on it directly, but not the other ones. That's about it, robertmaxrees?
[12:37:31] <robertmaxrees> "but not the other ones"?
[12:37:55] <sj13> The raw DOM nodes returned from other methods.
[12:38:00] <robertmaxrees> and $() also gives you sizzle support, so you have access to some extra selectors and cross-browser support/normalization wouldn't get otherwise.
[12:38:20] <taplar_lunch> how do i make this jsbin update...
[12:38:33] <robertmaxrees> km4 you want the mouseenter event, not mouseover
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> and event bubbling is killing you here.
[12:42:13] <km4> robertmaxrees: thanks its now I think work fine
[12:42:23] <km4> mouseenter and mouseleave
[13:07:12] <hlvwrk> hi
[13:07:51] <islalobo> I'm using full page js plugin but I can't figure out how to get sections to be scrollable (if the content is longer than the viewport). I've read through the options a dozen times and tried a number of things that should work, but without success
[13:08:30] <robertmaxrees> islalobo given that description, how do you think any of us could help you? :)
[13:11:11] <Uhkis> help him? it was just a statement :-D
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> Sure - how?
[13:11:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[13:12:00] <Uhkis> but he just wanted to let us know his status? :-D
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> hurr hurr
[13:12:18] <taplar> the without success, was that on the reading or the attempted tries?
[13:13:56] <taplar> meanwhile hlvwrk is like "these guys are mean" lol
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[13:14:07] <hlvwrk> o_O
[13:14:14] <taplar> c
[13:14:18] <hlvwrk> idk what's going on
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> we're just ribbing somebody over a generic problem description.
[13:15:13] <hlvwrk> mmm. Ribbing.
[13:15:23] <taplar> gutter, mind remove
[13:15:30] <hlvwrk> lol.
[13:15:33] <hlvwrk> can you blame me?
[13:15:38] <taplar> always
[13:15:44] <hlvwrk> Are you ribbing for his pleasure though?
[13:15:53] * taplar walks away
[13:15:55] <hlvwrk> LOL
[13:16:15] * hlvwrk puts on his crown.
[13:16:42] <taplar> mmmm, burger king
[13:17:19] <hlvwrk> said no-one ever.
[13:17:24] <taplar> lmao
[13:17:35] <hlvwrk> :P
[13:17:40] <hlvwrk> why am I at work this week?
[13:17:42] <hlvwrk> :|
[13:17:43] <taplar> hey, i'm stomaching some brocolli right now.  i'll take some bk over that any day
[13:18:00] <hlvwrk> broccoli is actually good if the person that cooked it knows how to cook :)
[13:18:21] <taplar> this is just straight steamed with some sort of spice
[13:18:22] <hlvwrk> fiancee makes delicious garlic broccoli. I could omnomnom on that all day.
[13:18:40] <hlvwrk> then again, she made me food today and I went out to eat with a co-worker.
[13:18:41] <hlvwrk> Hmph
[13:19:36] <hlvwrk> k brbs
[13:31:39] <islalobo> We're using laravel and trying to setup a one page parallax site using fullpage.js. This is our blade page with html and js: http://kopy.io/bKMjz  The contact form is larger than then viewport and the overflow is hidden. I'm looking at the different options available for fullpage.js to try to find an option that will allow the user to scroll to see the whole form (and footer)
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> can you make a standalone example with jsfiddle or something else?
[13:32:13] <robertmaxrees> since the js doesn't care about php?
[13:46:29] <islalobo> @robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/w8hp112j/
[13:47:36] <islalobo> If the viewport is smaller than the form, I'm not able to scroll ex. to view the submit button
[13:52:00] <robertmaxrees> i wonder what would happen if you slapped an extra div around that section and set overflow: scroll; on it.
[13:53:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm, yeah, but now you'll need to add a bunch of extra handling for the mousewheel.
[13:53:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w8hp112j/4/ i'd check out setting up some kind of pagination that makes you click next/prev buttons.
[13:55:47] <islalobo> @robertmaxrees does that scroll for you?
[13:55:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it functions, just not very well.
[13:56:10] <robertmaxrees> hence my remark about adding that extra handling for the mousewheel.,
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> sorry - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w8hp112j/5/
[13:56:47] <robertmaxrees> i had to constrain it manually.
[13:58:23] <islalobo> Oh, I see what you're doing there. That seems like a work around, I suppose. There should be options to get this to work properly with the fullpage.js options
[13:58:45] <hellyeah> hey again
[13:58:53] <hellyeah> taplar:  you still there
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> eh, fullscreen's just trying to do what it does very well.
[13:59:09] <taplar> yup
[13:59:24] <robertmaxrees> islalobo fwiw http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage is the solution it probably would suggest.
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> oh, islalobo it does support scrolling...
[14:00:31] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#including-files - This following line is only necessary in the case of using the plugin option `scrollOverflow:true` - then find the entry for scrollOverflow
[14:01:11] <hellyeah> taplar: let me understand something
[14:01:32] <hellyeah> when you use jquery function you have to wrap variable with $ right
[14:01:55] <taplar> unless it's available as $.* then yes
[14:02:04] <hellyeah> what is the negative thing of wrapping something unecessarily?
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> unless it's already a jquery object.
[14:02:16] <taplar> why repeat that step?
[14:02:20] <robertmaxrees> and running things through $() can be expensive if you don't need it.
[14:02:40] <taplar> D.R.Y man
[14:02:42] <hellyeah> no i just want to understand if there is something undesirable like performance problem or damaging dom
[14:02:49] <robertmaxrees> it can be slow.
[14:02:52] <taplar> ^
[14:02:55] <hellyeah> ic
[14:03:01] <robertmaxrees> it's also code smell.
[14:03:08] <hellyeah> because it tries to create object again and again
[14:03:13] <hellyeah> dont get me wrong folks
[14:03:22] <hellyeah> i have to teach stuff to my collegue
[14:03:27] <robertmaxrees> it protects itself from actually doing that, but it's an unnecessary step.
[14:03:34] <hellyeah> thats why i try to nderstand every small point
[14:03:40] <hellyeah> tbh jquery is awesome
[14:03:51] <hellyeah> but someone said dont use jquery in data manipulation
[14:03:58] <hellyeah> it damages dom tree so badly
[14:03:58] <taplar> huh?
[14:04:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:04:04] <hellyeah> use plain js instead
[14:04:13] <robertmaxrees> "data manipulation"?
[14:04:14] <taplar> define 'damages'
[14:04:22] <robertmaxrees> also this ^^^
[14:04:26] <hellyeah> i am not exactly clear
[14:04:30] <robertmaxrees> islalobo https://i.imgur.com/zepLk7p.png
[14:04:39] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah jquery doesn't do anything you don't tell it to do.
[14:04:40] <hellyeah> i dont know actually thats beyond my head
[14:04:45] <islalobo> @robertmaxrees I know fullpage.js supports scrolling as I've read over the documentation several times. I'm having trouble getting it to work as described.
[14:05:03] <taplar> when people throw out things like that, push them for an explanation
[14:05:12] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ all day.
[14:05:45] <hellyeah> he said adding new node to the dom tree can cause some conflict
[14:05:52] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[14:05:57] <arc_> -_-
[14:06:00] <hellyeah> okey then i pass
[14:06:08] <hellyeah> okey what i understand is
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> sounds like he's blaming jquery for sloppy code.
[14:06:37] <taplar> jquery is just a wrapper for commonly done processes with javascript.
[14:06:39] <arc_> sounds like we're trying to decode second hand information
[14:06:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:06:47] <hellyeah> if you select some element with jquery or if you create variable with jquery like var1 = $('<div>)
[14:06:53] <hellyeah> don r wrap with $
[14:06:58] <hellyeah> it can be expensive
[14:07:00] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's not a selector, for starters.
[14:07:01] <taplar> it can
[14:07:03] <robertmaxrees> and $() CAN be expensive.
[14:07:13] <robertmaxrees> so you avoid using it unless you need it.
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> like don't create elements unless you know you're doing to need the,.
[14:07:24] <hellyeah> what do you mean with starters?
[14:07:38] <hellyeah> can i do this
[14:07:39] <taplar> for starters === to being with
[14:07:39] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>') is not using a selector.
[14:07:45] <robertmaxrees> that's creating a new element.
[14:07:52] <robertmaxrees> using a document fragment.
[14:07:59] <islalobo> @robertmaxrees when I added the slimscroll.min.js the page sections just displayed the background color. Sections were set (by the plugin) as crazy height ex. 4000px. Scrolling broke.
[14:08:00] <hellyeah> var smt = querSelector('.smt'); $(smt)
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> that's distinct from your first example.
[14:08:21] <hellyeah> ops
[14:08:23] <hellyeah> wrong one
[14:08:27] <hellyeah> let me correct
[14:08:45] <hellyeah> var smt = createElement('<div>'); $(smt)
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[14:09:04] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>'); is fine.
[14:09:05] <hellyeah> and var smt = $('<div>');
[14:09:17] <robertmaxrees> just do that.  no reason to run createElement
[14:09:23] <hellyeah> what is the difference of these what is the negative thing of first thing i type
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> it adds an extra, unnecessary step.
[14:09:47] <hellyeah> typed*
[14:09:50] <robertmaxrees> it requires more mental overhead to understand.
[14:10:09] <hellyeah> does it really matter? is it a big deal or just kind of code smell
[14:10:15] <robertmaxrees> though to be 100% honest you shouldn't be using jquery as a templating engine much if at all, you're adding unnecessary work.
[14:10:37] <robertmaxrees> it matters if you want your code to make sense :) jquery is going to handle creating the element in a way that supports all browsers.
[14:10:43] <hellyeah> templating engine you mean creating elements?
[14:10:51] <robertmaxrees> yes.,
[14:11:01] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  ic
[14:11:12] <robertmaxrees> breaking that out into two steps is kind of silly.
[14:11:13] <hellyeah> so what i will do is creating element with jquery then
[14:11:33] <hellyeah> is that right?
[14:11:34] <robertmaxrees> do you do a lot of work with creating elements?
[14:11:45] <hellyeah> no
[14:11:52] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, just use jquery.
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> if you find yourself doing a lot of that, find a templating engine instead.
[14:12:22] <hellyeah> this is my example check line 48 http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/66/
[14:12:38] <hellyeah> handlebars.js is one of them
[14:13:07] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want to move elements.
[14:14:02] <hellyeah> btw let me share a music with you guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjpOzsQ9YI taplar you should check it out
[14:14:10] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees: yeah
[14:14:15] <taplar> that's still a work in progress.  he still needs to figure out his else statement, :)
[14:14:23] <hellyeah> i want to append an element to element that i created
[14:14:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  i guess i  will figure out what global lookup means
[14:14:47] <taplar> $(selector)
[14:14:50] <taplar> global lookup
[14:14:57] <hellyeah> i guess i need to use something similar in else that i used in if
[14:15:00] <robertmaxrees> that seems a little funky - why are you creating a new ul on every drop?
[14:15:01] <hellyeah> this.closest
[14:15:09] <hlvwrk> uhhh
[14:15:12] <hellyeah> well
[14:15:18] <taplar> in your else, you don't need to look anything up
[14:15:19] <hlvwrk> at the end of an if statement are you not supposed to close with ;?
[14:15:23] <hellyeah> you can drop a onto b
[14:15:24] <taplar> you already have your newly created ul
[14:15:39] <hlvwrk> if (boolean) { return false }; ?
[14:15:44] <hellyeah> a b  is a div you can drop c into div that was created you will have a b c
[14:15:44] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk you don't need to.
[14:15:47] <hlvwrk> but you can.
[14:15:56] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk also, just do return !boolean;
[14:15:56] <hellyeah> but you can drag f onto g you will have new div
[14:15:57] <hlvwrk> it's not *invalid*
[14:16:19] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  it is for grouping you can have more than one group.
[14:16:33] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you assume that you always need a new group :)
[14:16:38] <taplar> i'm in viz e bull
[14:16:59] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees: it is not done yet
[14:17:02] <hellyeah> i try to fix
[14:17:16] <hellyeah> vizz e bull what does that mean?
[14:17:23] <taplar> i'm being stupid
[14:17:28] <taplar> read my last two lines
[14:17:28] <hlvwrk> that's not nice
[14:17:34] <hlvwrk> be nicer to yourself
[14:17:44] <taplar> nah, i deserve it
[14:17:48] <hlvwrk> nah
[14:17:51] <hlvwrk> you deserve better.
[14:17:53] <hellyeah> what did you deserver?
[14:17:56] <robertmaxrees> and hlvwrk http://stackoverflow.com/a/17036218/923919
[14:17:56] <taplar> lol
[14:18:01] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[14:18:09] <hellyeah> i guess i am stupid
[14:18:18] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:18:25] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk ; meant to end a single statement - {} are meant to group a series of statements.
[14:18:26] <taplar> no ignore my last couple statements,  go back to where i said you don't have to select anything
[14:18:34] <hellyeah> taplar:  i read your sentence
[14:18:49] <hellyeah> i am sorry if i did any disrespectful thing to you
[14:18:54] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk so it's not necessarily invalid, but it's entirely unnecessary.,
[14:18:56] <taplar> none at all
[14:19:02] <taplar> so do you get what i'm saying?
[14:19:20] <hellyeah> i try to understand
[14:19:37] <hellyeah> newly created
[14:20:00] <taplar> lol, now that i think about it, 'newly' is pointless
[14:20:07] <hellyeah> i suppose in else there is no droppablediv
[14:20:13] <taplar> there is
[14:20:16] <taplar> your making one
[14:20:36] <hellyeah> here  var div2 = $('<ul>');
[14:20:36] <hellyeah>    div2.attr('class', 'droppablediv');
[14:20:41] <taplar> but then your looking up all droppablediv to append to that other thing
[14:20:49] <taplar> instead of using the one you JUST made
[14:21:25] <hellyeah> taplar:    div2.append($(this));
[14:21:25] <hellyeah>       div2.append(a.draggable); so this line is wrong
[14:21:33] <hellyeah> i just use that i created?
[14:21:37] <taplar> no, but it's incomplete
[14:21:45] <taplar> you created it.  doesn't mean it's attached to the dom yet
[14:22:00] <hellyeah> ah
[14:22:12] <hellyeah> damn
[14:22:15] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[14:22:30] <hellyeah> it is just copy and paste mistake
[14:22:36] <hellyeah> i am stupid sometimes
[14:22:40] <taplar> -read- your code
[14:23:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/67/
[14:23:25] <taplar> hey!
[14:23:40] <hellyeah> i didnt re wrap variable
[14:23:46] <hellyeah> i was careful about that
[14:23:51] <hellyeah> :D
[14:24:06] <taplar> good
[14:24:18] <taplar> and does it work?
[14:24:57] <hellyeah> taplar:  you have either really good patience or you are really passionate :D
[14:25:19] <taplar> i like to think i don't know any better
[14:26:08] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:26:13] <robertmaxrees> we just like seeing people succeed.
[14:26:18] <taplar> ^
[14:26:22] <hellyeah> wow
[14:26:27] <hellyeah> humanist folks
[14:26:30] <hellyeah> i like that
[14:26:33] <hellyeah> :d
[14:26:44] <hellyeah> hey
[14:26:49] <hellyeah> it is nicely done
[14:27:03] <hlvwrk> so... in a function like: self.listenTo(my.channels.resize, 'window:resize', function () { //do function });
[14:27:09] <hlvwrk> the end ; is correct?
[14:27:15] <hlvwrk> or unnecessary.
[14:27:20] <taplar> depends
[14:27:23] <robertmaxrees> that's correct.
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> wait
[14:27:29] <robertmaxrees> back waaaaaaay up.
[14:27:37] <taplar> technically if it's the last statement in a {} then the ; is optional
[14:27:46] <robertmaxrees> *optional.
[14:27:53] <robertmaxrees> so there's a thing called ASI that makes all of this kind of weird.
[14:28:06] <Uhkis> also its not {} block
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> it dictates the rules of where the engine will insert semicolons for you if you forget them.
[14:28:28] <robertmaxrees> "optional" often means "ASI will save you", but that doesn't necessarily mean you have valid code.
[14:28:29] <arc_> if it's kind of weird and including it is not going to break anything, sounds like you should jsut include it instead of trying to learn when you can save yourself from typing one character :p
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> it just means "the ASI algo can generally figure out what you probably meant"
[14:28:58] <taplar> yeah.  some uglifiers will remove them though
[14:28:58] <robertmaxrees> something a lot of people (myself included) don't like to rely on.
[14:29:18] <robertmaxrees> sure, because they're minifying them.
[14:29:26] <hlvwrk> so my review comments told me to add in 'missing semicolons'
[14:29:40] <taplar> yeah which is where my statement was coming from.  but from a readability standpoint, use em
[14:29:41] <hlvwrk> so I added them in everywhere where they *could* go in, even if technically not needed.
[14:29:44] <taplar> makes it concise
[14:29:51] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk that's a bad way to solve that problem.
[14:29:58] <hellyeah> em supports responsiblity right
[14:30:03] <hlvwrk> there technically isn't a problem
[14:30:06] <hlvwrk> that's the issue
[14:30:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you like electronic guitar?
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> *electric guitar
[14:30:20] <Uhkis> hlvwrk is some python coder?
[14:30:22] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk sure there is - bad code foramt.
[14:30:23] <taplar> hellyeah:what are you referring to with 'em'?
[14:30:35] <hlvwrk> i'm a JS dev. He's a python dev.
[14:30:37] <arc_> i always thought you are supposed to add a semicolon after you insert a function as a parameter because it's technically just one term
[14:30:38] <hellyeah> "em" css thing
[14:30:41] <hellyeah> like px
[14:30:55] <hellyeah> right?
[14:30:56] <robertmaxrees> arc_ huh?
[14:30:57] <taplar> em is a compounded version of rem
[14:31:07] * hlvwrk shudders.
[14:31:07] <hlvwrk> rem
[14:31:12] <taplar> which is based on the body font size
[14:31:23] <robertmaxrees> "responsive ems" iirc
[14:31:27] <hlvwrk> eehhh
[14:31:27] <taplar> root
[14:31:29] <hlvwrk> EMS
[14:31:33] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:31:34] * hlvwrk shudders so much
[14:31:41] <Uhkis> its the end of the woorld as we know it
[14:31:45] <taplar> lol
[14:31:46] <hlvwrk> good song
[14:32:01] <hellyeah> what about vh, vw ?
[14:32:02] <taplar> em's are affected by parent ems
[14:32:04] <taplar> rem is not
[14:32:05] <Uhkis> also: REM :-D
[14:32:12] <hlvwrk> RUM.
[14:32:16] * hellyeah losing my religion
[14:32:16] <taplar> vh and vw are viewport based
[14:32:17] <hlvwrk> Spiced.
[14:32:17] <hlvwrk> plz
[14:32:33] <taplar> 100vw is 100% of the viewport width
[14:32:40] <taplar> you can guess vh
[14:32:53] <Uhkis> 45% ?
[14:32:56] <hellyeah> btw
[14:33:01] <hellyeah> vw cause scroll bar
[14:33:05] <taplar> can
[14:33:09] <hlvwrk> I really don't understand the semicolon debacle.
[14:33:11] <hlvwrk> o.o
[14:33:28] <hellyeah> what is the reason of that
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk you use them to end single statements.  that's all.  people don't understand what a statement is.
[14:33:49] <arc_> like ... i suppose i don't know if i'm thinking about this in the right way, but it seems like when you do something like $('selector').each(function () { ... }); , you're basically passing a function as a parameter and that's basically one statement, even though it contains a function
[14:33:52] <taplar> i'm not entirely sure.  probably something to do with some margins or spacing that's pushing it over
[14:33:58] <taplar> #css would know more
[14:34:17] <robertmaxrees> arc_ you used a semicolon correctly there.
[14:34:18] <taplar> your talking to a shade tree mechanic right now, :)
[14:34:30] <arc_> i know, i'm really just talking about why it's correct
[14:34:42] <robertmaxrees> because calling a function is a single statement.
[14:34:48] <arc_> right, ok
[14:34:48] <robertmaxrees> someFunction(); - that's a statement.
[14:34:56] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter what you're passing to it.
[14:35:07] <arc_> that's what i was trying to confirm
[14:35:12] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i ask your opinion about something?
[14:35:15] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[14:35:19] <taplar> no!
[14:35:21] <taplar> what's up?
[14:36:19] <taplar> you gonna ask me about shade tree mechanic? :D i know that one is obscure
[14:37:59] * taplar is left hanging
[14:39:19] <arc_> don't worry, he'll be back. he'll always be back
[14:39:23] <taplar> lol
[14:39:24] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:39:33] <hellyeah> arc_:  me?
[14:39:33] <taplar> for some reason i pictured you with a cigar
[14:39:39] <arc_> ya u
[14:40:12] <hellyeah> this is my conversation in another channel
[14:40:14] <hellyeah> human brain contains two parts besically
[14:40:14] <hellyeah> eq and iq
[14:40:15] <hellyeah> finding music that activates the both sides is always good tho
[14:40:15] <hellyeah> music is kinda of math but also full of emotion
[14:40:15] <hellyeah> if you know what i mean
[14:40:15] <hellyeah> not every music ofc
[14:40:17] <hellyeah> ops
[14:40:19] <arc_> hahah
[14:40:20] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:40:32] <hellyeah> i didnt know that was coming
[14:40:36] <arc_> that sounds like an extreme oversimplification
[14:40:40] <hellyeah> you can kick me in my butt
[14:41:03] <taplar> there are 10 kinds of people
[14:41:40] <arc_> if you find yourself wanting to categorize something into two parts, you can safely assume that it's probably more complex than that, pretty much regardless of what you're talking about
[14:41:50] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[14:42:00] <hellyeah> arc_:  sure
[14:42:10] <robertmaxrees> as a musician, it's much simpler AND much more complex than you're making it sound.
[14:42:38] <hellyeah> arc_:  we are just categorizing as it needs to be for that moment
[14:42:52] <hellyeah> brain is just limitless :XD
[14:43:02] <taplar> dang it hellyeah, what were you going to ask me
[14:43:05] <taplar> lol
[14:43:08] <hellyeah> sure
[14:43:11] <hellyeah> :XD
[14:43:42] <hellyeah> if yuou do close button to the droppable div and when you click x and remove the droppable div. Those buttons in droppable div go back to its place?
[14:43:43] <taplar> i feel some ocd stuff here
[14:43:54] <hellyeah> i dunno what ocd is
[14:44:09] <taplar> close button?
[14:44:38] <hellyeah> yes
[14:44:49] <taplar> what close button?
[14:44:50] <hellyeah> you know for destroying droppable div
[14:44:57] <taplar> no, that's why i'm asking
[14:45:03] <arc_> i think he's saying there will be an X on each droppable that closes it
[14:45:26] <taplar> then it depends
[14:45:34] <hellyeah> yes
[14:45:35] <taplar> if you just destroy the droppable, then no
[14:45:41] <hellyeah> sorry for my english
[14:45:42] <taplar> you'll have to put them back yourself
[14:45:58] <hellyeah> is there a shortcut that handles that? :xd
[14:46:02] <taplar> nope
[14:46:10] <taplar> your doing custom logic dude, you have to cleanup your own mess
[14:46:21] <hellyeah> haha
[14:46:29] <hellyeah> thats how i rolll
[14:46:33] <taplar> :)
[14:46:33] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[14:46:48] <taplar> not that hard though
[14:47:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:47:34] <hellyeah> not sure how hard it is
[14:47:36] <hellyeah> :p
[14:47:48] <taplar> find them, append them back to the original parent.  delete the droppable
[14:48:00] <taplar> boom
[14:48:06] <hellyeah> yes
[14:48:17] <hellyeah> like find('.buttonClass')
[14:48:26] <taplar> given that your doing that on a parent, yes
[14:48:27] <hellyeah> append to ('.buttonDiv)
[14:48:34] <taplar> but you want the lis
[14:48:37] <hellyeah> droppablediv.destroy
[14:48:44] <taplar> remove()
[14:48:54] <hellyeah> there is also destroy afaik
[14:48:59] <taplar> hmm
[14:49:02] <hellyeah> hmm okey it is remove
[14:49:30] <hellyeah> guess ithere is no destroy
[14:49:36] <taplar> detach() and remove()
[14:49:44] <hellyeah> btwe
[14:49:53] <robertmaxrees> .remove() works fine fore that.
[14:49:53] <hellyeah> li is parent of buttonClass
[14:49:54] <robertmaxrees> *for
[14:50:08] <taplar> so just find the lis
[14:50:22] <hellyeah> it is better find('.buttonClass').closest('li');
[14:50:25] <taplar> no
[14:50:30] <taplar> just get the lis
[14:50:37] <taplar> it's not like your going to ignore some
[14:51:57] <hellyeah> $('.droppablediv li')
[14:52:13] <taplar> $(this).find('li')
[14:52:33] <taplar> you gotta start thinking contextually dude, :)
[14:52:40] <hellyeah> in this case "this" is close button
[14:52:42] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah have you run through any tutorials?
[14:52:54] <hellyeah> try jquery
[14:52:59] <hellyeah> i read elaquent
[14:53:07] <hellyeah> and i am reading some other stuff
[14:53:08] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ <- give this a shot.
[14:53:35] <robertmaxrees> You'll get a lot of use out of that video.
[14:54:30] <hellyeah> there is video or document tutorial
[14:54:35] <taplar> where is this video?
[14:54:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> get away from videos imo.
[14:54:56] <hellyeah> taplar: a this good thing or bad you gotta start thinking contextually dude
[14:55:01] <arc_> you said video but i don't think you meant to
[14:55:14] <taplar> uh, it's not good/bad persay
[14:55:15] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you aren't thinking contextually - that's the problem.
[14:55:19] <taplar> it's.... necessary?
[14:56:01] <hlvwrk> o.O
[14:56:05] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i try my doin to go further :XD
[14:56:06] <hlvwrk> ur necessary.
[14:56:11] <taplar> awww
[14:56:31] <taplar> that's either really nice, or kinda stalkery
[14:56:34] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i have 70 percentage loss in my seeing perspective it is hard to read
[14:56:47] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  if you have video that may be much better for me
[14:56:59] <arc_> peripheral vision you mean?
[14:57:16] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah i'm sorry to hear.  i highly suggest figuring out how to work around that since the majority of documentation out there is written, not oral.
[14:57:32] <hellyeah> stalkery is nice word
[14:57:35] <hellyeah> hahahahaha,
[14:57:43] <arc_> if you have a hard time reading i find it quite surprising that you haven't already started using a screen reader
[14:57:46] <robertmaxrees> which is sad, but since you're dealing with code that's to be expected.
[14:57:47] <taplar> Ctrl+(+) the crap out of those docs
[14:58:02] <hellyeah> arc_:  try my best for correct word
[14:58:13] <hellyeah> i do that actually i am reading 22 px
[14:58:20] <hellyeah> but it is still tiring
[14:58:32] <hellyeah> but that challenge me i like that
[14:58:33] <hellyeah> eheh
[14:58:38] <hellyeah> thanks for helping btw
[14:59:36] <hellyeah> btw yoghurt is yummy
[14:59:43] <hellyeah> i like yoghurt
[15:01:07] <arc_> o_O
[15:01:57] <hellyeah> also i have to make a div for naming
[15:02:08] <taplar> ?
[15:02:11] <hellyeah> so when user drop button on to anoter one
[15:02:18] <hellyeah> droppable div is created
[15:02:28] <hellyeah> right user wants to give a name to the div
[15:02:37] <taplar> oh good lord
[15:02:50] <hellyeah> taplar:  what happened?
[15:03:05] <hellyeah> is it obscure?
[15:03:08] <taplar> lol, they want to group their buttons and name them?
[15:03:17] <hellyeah> yeah
[15:03:25] <taplar> give me an example
[15:03:26] <hellyeah> group buttons
[15:03:31] <hellyeah> and name the div
[15:03:36] <hellyeah> right
[15:03:54] <hellyeah> just a sec
[15:05:12] <hellyeah> taplar:  we have this
[15:05:29] <hellyeah> think you grtoup numbers i letts and symbols seperately
[15:05:38] <hellyeah> there is three divs
[15:05:53] <hellyeah> user wants to name it like numbers, letters, symbols
[15:06:07] <hellyeah> so he will know what is where.
[15:06:07] <taplar> that sounds very generic
[15:06:22] <taplar> for your application, what would be an example name?
[15:06:36] <hellyeah> well let me think about this
[15:06:52] <hellyeah> mobile application test environment
[15:07:24] <hellyeah> that will contains all buttons related with all mobile applications that are in test environment
[15:07:36] <hellyeah> theree can be 20 buttons
[15:07:39] <taplar> ok, so they're going to drag buttons around.  this one is "test something"  this other one is "prod something' and so on and so forth
[15:07:46] <hellyeah> and each butts direct to you table
[15:07:54] <taplar> so now question
[15:07:55] <hellyeah> yes
[15:07:59] <hellyeah> so many services
[15:08:05] <taplar> can you not group them already for them?
[15:08:05] * hellyeah reading
[15:08:18] <hellyeah> i can
[15:08:24] <taplar> soooo ?
[15:08:29] <hellyeah> may be my manager try to test my limit
[15:08:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  you know what we do right
[15:08:40] <taplar> remember the mvp we talked about...
[15:08:43] <hellyeah> expand the div
[15:08:53] <hellyeah> well for that
[15:08:57] <hellyeah> i will ask my manager
[15:09:07] <hellyeah> and he said there is no furteher requirements
[15:09:07] <taplar> here's the thing
[15:09:16] <hellyeah> so i just make them all
[15:09:19] <taplar> that's very odd, to make your users do that
[15:09:28] <taplar> and they'd have to do it every time
[15:09:33] <hellyeah> no
[15:09:34] <cannap> !test
[15:09:35] <Jamazia> Your bot is working!
[15:09:39] <hellyeah> there is one last thing
[15:09:40] <cannap> lol
[15:09:41] <cannap> !test
[15:09:42] <Jamazia> Your bot is working!
[15:09:44] <hellyeah> taplar:
[15:09:44] <cannap> !quit
[15:09:46] <hellyeah> hear me out
[15:09:48] <robertmaxrees> aaand another bot.
[15:09:53] <cannap> its not mine
[15:10:10] <hellyeah> i will get dom tree to the backend
[15:10:17] <hellyeah> and write it to xml file
[15:10:22] <cannap> !g jquery
[15:10:23] <taplar> :(
[15:10:27] <hellyeah> and i do ajax call to get that xml file
[15:10:31] <taplar> for every user
[15:10:34] <cannap> !commands
[15:10:35] <hellyeah> and return bac to dom
[15:10:36] <cannap> !help
[15:10:39] <cannap> so i stop
[15:10:40] <cannap> :D
[15:10:55] <hellyeah> every user will have its own page
[15:11:10] <hellyeah> when they group buttons and close the page then open again
[15:11:18] <hellyeah> they will see same groupping
[15:11:34] <hellyeah> or whatever they did lastly
[15:11:36] <taplar> small side note.  why xml?
[15:11:49] <hellyeah> hmm thats my idea
[15:11:53] <cannap> json?
[15:11:57] <hellyeah> iş dont know there is better choice
[15:12:01] <hellyeah> json yes
[15:12:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused.  hellyeah what's your jquery question?
[15:12:13] <hellyeah> hmm i just think keep json as xml in a file
[15:12:18] <cannap> oO
[15:12:31] <hellyeah> anyway this is kind of off topic
[15:12:37] <hellyeah> i am sorry robertmaxrees
[15:12:49] <hellyeah> cannap:  i am amateur that tries to discover stuff
[15:12:49] <robertmaxrees> it's fine, just seeing a massive derail ;)
[15:12:55] <cannap> use json
[15:13:07] <hellyeah> i am not in there yet cannap
[15:13:12] <hellyeah> but i keep it in my mind
[15:13:24] <hellyeah> btw json is xml right
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:13:31] <robertmaxrees> totally different format.
[15:13:38] <cannap> myjson JSON.parse(file)
[15:13:44] <robertmaxrees> XML is a markup language, JSON is JavaScript Object Notation
[15:13:44] <cannap> myjson.get.the.stuff.right.here
[15:14:02] <robertmaxrees> thought JSON is not JavaScript - important thing to keep in mind.
[15:14:05] <taplar> so users are going to group buttons and label them.  somehow this gets sent back to the backend to be stored.  and is retrieved on page load.  and some how is used to re-arrange buttons back how they were
[15:14:07] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am working o a big bank
[15:14:14] <hellyeah> one of the biggest ban k of country
[15:14:18] <cannap> and in xml getChildren.bla from what ever
[15:14:22] <hellyeah> so this project is really challenger
[15:14:25] <hellyeah> and big one
[15:14:41] <taplar> lets get back on topic.  what's your question about the labeling?
[15:14:46] <hellyeah> taplar:  exactly you are my fella :)
[15:15:08] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i do this with textbox
[15:15:15] <taplar> sure
[15:15:35] <cannap> in xml you have <> this stuff but not in json
[15:15:36] <taplar> you need some kinda of trigger though to know that it needs to be sent to the bak end
[15:15:39] <taplar> *backend
[15:15:41] <cannap> i have no idea which one is faster try it out
[15:15:44] <cannap> what you want :D
[15:15:47] <cannap> i need to go
[15:15:49] <cannap> cu
[15:15:53] <hellyeah> by
[15:16:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i suggest you a song?
[15:16:37] <taplar> lets stick to the topic, :P
[15:17:36] <hellyeah> oke :D
[15:17:38] <taplar> do you know the requirements of this labeling and persistance option?
[15:18:03] <hellyeah> persistance?
[15:18:15] <taplar> the sending it to the backend
[15:18:19] <hellyeah> taplar:  i just know people can name the div
[15:18:28] <taplar> you need to ask more questions
[15:18:42] <hellyeah> i dont know how to backend stuff
[15:18:52] <robertmaxrees> then learn ;)
[15:18:53] <hellyeah> i just knoıw i will get spesific div into json
[15:19:00] <hellyeah> one by one
[15:19:24] <hellyeah> there is really lots of thing i need to combine
[15:19:34] <hellyeah> damn
[15:19:48] <hellyeah> anyway almost sleeping hour
[15:19:51] <hellyeah> need to go
[15:19:55] <hellyeah> thanks for helping
[15:20:13] <hellyeah> thanks for helpin 10:30 p.m.
[15:20:25] <taplar> ask more questions about that option.  also ask if it could be done without with pre grouping
[15:20:34] <taplar> you need to know what is expected
[15:21:12] <hellyeah> pre grouping?
[15:21:24] <taplar> grouping ahead of time, instead of based on user
[15:21:41] <hellyeah> i think
[15:21:44] <hellyeah> he wanted much
[15:22:00] <hellyeah> so many things in a row
[15:22:17] <taplar> ask what problem he is trying to solve with that.  and if that problem can be solved with pregrouping
[15:22:30] <taplar> cause that's a bit of logic that could be removed if possible
[15:23:17] <hellyeah> i guess each deparment can use that screen
[15:23:23] <hellyeah> and do your owen grouping
[15:23:36] <taplar> nothing says the pregrouping couldn't operate differently depending on departmetn
[15:24:13] <taplar> views are great
[15:24:38] <hellyeah> ic
[15:24:41] <hellyeah> i will ask
[15:25:09] <hellyeah> good day taplar have a good day
[15:25:16] <taplar> u2
[15:25:35] <taplar> lol
[15:25:51] <taplar> i oddly wish he'd have changed his name to hellno
[15:26:56] <taplar> o.O
[15:34:53] <Dr-007> i've got nested html tables with checkboxes in the tables. with one table i could do this: $("tbody input[type=checkbox]:checked") to only get the tbody selected checkboxes. i want to ignore the ones in thead, but because i now have nested tables the thead is no longer ignored because in the second table my thead exists in a tbody
[15:35:29] <robertmaxrees> .filter() out ones and use .closest()?
[15:37:14] <claytonzaugg> How would I perform an action if an <li> item obtains a class of 'active' and the inner <a> tag has an id of #tab_2?
[15:37:41] <Dr-007> thanks
[15:37:41] <robertmaxrees> use .hasClass() and .find()
[15:37:51] <Dr-007> im trying .filter()
[15:39:15] <taplar> claytonzaugg:what action and when?
[15:39:56] <claytonzaugg> taplar, I have a navigation, and when a certain tab is clicked, I want the sub nav to appear, or unhide essentially
[15:40:13] <robertmaxrees> right - combo of hasClass() and .find()
[15:41:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, stick a data attribute on the element with the ID of the thing you want to unhide and go to town.
[15:41:04] <taplar> would he need hasClass()?  i'd figure this would be some sort of tag on logic in/after the logic that puts it on
[15:41:06] <robertmaxrees> few different ways to do it.
[15:41:09] <claytonzaugg> Correct robertmaxrees, I'm going to work on integrating that now.  Thank you, I'll follow up if I get stuck on it
[15:41:17] <robertmaxrees> (without seeing the actual markup it's hard to help)
[15:41:51] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees and taplar, here you go: https://jsfiddle.net/ud8yx3dk/
[15:42:14] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:42:23] <claytonzaugg> Test and Test2 should ONLY appear if Center Tasks is clicked
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> so you want a click event listener.
[15:42:36] <robertmaxrees> also $('li a#tab2_5') will always be truthy
[15:45:24] <taplar> i guess we're also assuming that this is on some form of a spa site
[15:45:38] <claytonzaugg> lol
[15:45:49] <taplar> yay/nay?
[15:46:12] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a9f391rc/
[15:46:13] <robertmaxrees> see?
[15:46:14] <claytonzaugg> No, it is not a spa site :D
[15:46:20] <robertmaxrees> i think he means SPA.
[15:46:26] <robertmaxrees> single page application.
[15:46:26] <taplar> ^
[15:46:42] <claytonzaugg> Oh, sorry, very much a single page app
[15:46:46] <taplar> k
[15:47:00] <claytonzaugg> lol wow, that's hilarious that I didn't know that phrase!
[15:47:31] <taplar> u were all like, wtf does this have to do with hot springs?
[15:47:37] <claytonzaugg> LOL
[15:48:03] <claytonzaugg> It's true, I was wondering how any of my tab names lead to the assumption it was a up and coming spa website
[15:48:17] <taplar> that's redundant
[15:48:19] <claytonzaugg> "Come get your relaxation on, at this spa!"
[15:48:20] <taplar> up and coming spa
[15:48:32] <taplar> :P
[15:48:38] <claytonzaugg> LOL
[15:48:49] <claytonzaugg> aight, checking out a click event real quick
[15:48:56] <robertmaxrees> event handler.
[15:49:14] <claytonzaugg> https://api.jquery.com/click/
[15:49:20] <claytonzaugg> Correcet?
[15:49:25] <robertmaxrees> i prefer .on(), but yeah.
[15:49:28] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it.
[15:49:33] <claytonzaugg> $( "#target" ).click(function() {
[15:49:33] <claytonzaugg>   alert( "Handler for .click() called." );
[15:49:33] <claytonzaugg> });
[15:49:42] <robertmaxrees> hey please don't multiline paste.
[15:49:44] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[15:49:54] <claytonzaugg> out of curiousity, why do you prever .on()
[15:50:12] <robertmaxrees> because .click() is really just .on('click' under the hood.
[15:50:20] <claytonzaugg> sorry about the multiline paste, thought it'd just... well it doesn't matter.  Won't do it again.
[15:50:27] <robertmaxrees> :) it's all good.
[15:50:31] <taplar> and on() is one step away from being a delegate
[15:53:05] <claytonzaugg> hmm, yeah reading through both right now and wondering, is it possible to check the the parent of the <a> tag, that being the <li> if it hasClass('active')?
[15:53:27] <claytonzaugg> is that what the .on() would allow me to do do, syntatically
[15:53:31] <robertmaxrees> sure :) learn.jquery.com has some great tutorials that'll show you the ropes.
[15:53:40] <robertmaxrees> .on() and .click() function identically.
[15:53:50] <claytonzaugg> Cool, I'm gunna have to do some more work on those two.
[15:53:53] <claytonzaugg> Thanks
[15:53:57] <robertmaxrees> you have a $(this) that represents the thing that was clicked inside the handler.
[15:54:32] <claytonzaugg> so would you check $(this).parent().hasClass('active')?
[15:54:45] <robertmaxrees> .closest().length is my preference.
[15:55:05] <robertmaxrees> though this would be even easier with a delegated listener.
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('click
[15:55:15] <robertmaxrees> , woops
[15:55:28] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('click', '.active #someId', function() {}0;
[15:56:38] <taplar> i would go so far as to not base it off of id.  just active.  and put some data element on the link to know which sublist needs to be manipulated
[15:56:45] <claytonzaugg> okay so the syntax is, referring to my jsfiddle, $('li').on('click', '.active a#tab2_5', function() {console.log('test')};
[15:56:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:56:54] <robertmaxrees> not the li
[15:56:55] <robertmaxrees> and don'
[15:57:05] <robertmaxrees> *don't prepend id selectors with tagnames
[15:57:14] <claytonzaugg> see that's where I'm confused I think
[15:57:33] <claytonzaugg> the files I'm working with, apply .active to the <li> element
[15:57:56] <claytonzaugg> wait, i can just check if .active and child has id of XXX then do this
[15:58:02] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[15:58:24] <claytonzaugg> unfortunately that's how my mind interpretted the process
[15:58:45] <robertmaxrees> show me your html again?
[15:58:49] <robertmaxrees> can't find your fiddle.
[15:58:56] <claytonzaugg> https://jsfiddle.net/ud8yx3dk/
[15:59:17] <robertmaxrees> wait why do you care about clicks on the current active thing?
[15:59:32] <robertmaxrees> or is this on active subnav items?
[16:00:13] <claytonzaugg> I don'tknow how to answer that, only that I know when it's clicked, it adds active to the tab.  I need to add a subnav to tab2_5 when it's clicked, and hide it when it is no longer active
[16:00:27] <robertmaxrees> so back way up.
[16:00:30] <claytonzaugg> I thought I'd check for .active class and go from there
[16:00:33] <robertmaxrees> this is just to hide/show subnav items?
[16:00:47] <taplar> that was my take away
[16:00:50] <claytonzaugg> sorry, yes, but I didn't know how to easily do it other than identifying if the parent was active
[16:01:07] <robertmaxrees> except the parent isn't active yet.
[16:01:20] <claytonzaugg> and parent is <li> in my assumption
[16:01:33] <claytonzaugg> correct?
[16:01:33] <robertmaxrees> you're all confused :)
[16:01:36] <claytonzaugg> LOL
[16:01:46] <claytonzaugg> help me obi-maxtress, you're my only hope!
[16:01:49] <robertmaxrees> you want to activate the subnav when somebody clicks on each <li> right?
[16:01:51] <huncho_> how to execute $.post before submitting form ?
[16:02:16] <claytonzaugg> correct robertmaxrees, well, on certain <li>'s, i want a subnav to appear
[16:02:36] <robertmaxrees> how are you determining if a subnav should appear?
[16:03:12] <taplar> huncho_:you'll most likely want to conditionally cancel the submit, perform the post and after it is done, submit again
[16:03:14] <claytonzaugg> for example, I know that Center Tasks, #tab2_5, needs to have a subnav
[16:03:28] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you need to change a few small things here.
[16:03:33] <claytonzaugg> ok
[16:03:51] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg first off you need slightly more semantic markup - use classnames that clarify what's going on here.
[16:04:28] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, on <li> or <a>?
[16:04:40] <robertmaxrees> the <li>
[16:04:44] <claytonzaugg> okay
[16:04:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ud8yx3dk/1/
[16:04:54] <robertmaxrees> and on the subnav container div
[16:05:16] <claytonzaugg> Ah, okay navbutton AND active!
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> ignore the active.
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> that has literally nothing to do with your current question :)
[16:05:32] <claytonzaugg> For sure, but navbutton
[16:05:42] <claytonzaugg> correct correct
[16:06:03] <claytonzaugg> go on I'm listening, just got excited cause I had an ah-ha moment with that
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> even better; https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ud8yx3dk/2/
[16:06:52] * taplar is off to play in traffic.  later all
[16:06:59] <claytonzaugg> ah, adding the hide correct?
[16:07:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:07:50] <robertmaxrees> see where i'm headed with this?
[16:08:54] <claytonzaugg> I believe so
[16:09:03] <claytonzaugg> let me rehash it if you don't mind
[16:09:13] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[16:09:16] <robertmaxrees> don't rehash - code.
[16:09:22] <claytonzaugg> okay, let me code it real quick
[16:09:30] <arc_> lol -_-
[16:10:07] <robertmaxrees> for the more complete example: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ud8yx3dk/4/
[16:10:57] <claytonzaugg> reading through the js code now, trying to make sure I understand it
[16:11:54] <claytonzaugg> Ah, I didn't catch you adding navlink to the <a> tags
[16:12:02] <robertmaxrees> part of the steps.
[16:12:18] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to play with that idea, but that should help get you going.
[16:12:48] <claytonzaugg> closest()???
[16:12:53] <robertmaxrees> google ;)
[16:13:02] <claytonzaugg> one sec, googling
[16:14:08] <claytonzaugg> Oh, it travels up the tree
[16:14:39] <claytonzaugg> Oh hell, that's how you get the parent, or the class/id/tag you want ABOVE where you are@!
[16:15:15] <claytonzaugg> Very cool, very cool indeed.  I have never used these functions yet
[16:15:43] <robertmaxrees> it's good stuff to know.
[16:16:20] <claytonzaugg> that's freaking cool, cause you're saying, "Look at the parent above here, that has a class of navbutton, and remove the class .hide"
[16:16:41] <robertmaxrees> it's a simpler way of doing all that.
[16:17:01] <claytonzaugg> Very neat indeed, I'll be playing around with this now for awhile to perfect my solution.  Thank you very much robertmaxrees, your ability to teach is always appreciated and welcomed.
[16:17:08] <robertmaxrees> deffo :)
[16:25:17] <claytonzaugg> so I integrated the modified code, but it's not removing the hide class, trying to troubleshoot now, but any guesses why that wouldn't work?
[16:25:25] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, sorry that was meant for you
[16:25:35] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea without seeing what you have.
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> had selector?
[16:25:43] <robertmaxrees> *bad selector
[16:25:58] <claytonzaugg> yeah, possibly, let me troubleshoot more and come back if I cna't figure it out.
[16:42:17] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, it's working here on jsfiddle, but not inside my code.  https://jsfiddle.net/ud8yx3dk/6/
[16:42:28] <robertmaxrees> any console errors on your site?
[16:42:42] <claytonzaugg> One of the differences is, there's css somewhere that's throwing !important on the .hide class
[16:42:49] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:42:54] <claytonzaugg> but that shouldn't override the jquery removing the class though right
[16:42:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:43:12] <robertmaxrees> any console errors on your site?  are you dynamically creating that UL?
[16:43:36] <claytonzaugg> freakin A gosh dangit! No it's not dynamically, I'm for sure editing the raw <ul>
[16:43:45] <claytonzaugg> no errors that I see
[16:43:57] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you toss a console log into that handler?
[16:44:32] <claytonzaugg> lemme check
[16:45:17] <claytonzaugg> ...nothing
[16:45:19] <claytonzaugg> wtf
[16:45:33] <robertmaxrees> is your js before or after your html?
[16:45:38] <robertmaxrees> might need a document ready.
[16:45:46] <claytonzaugg> I have the js OUTISDE the document.ready
[16:45:56] <claytonzaugg> or should that be inside the document.ready?
[16:46:07] <robertmaxrees> errr, if the js is before the html, it needs to be inside of it.
[16:46:11] <claytonzaugg> lemme try
[16:46:28] <claytonzaugg> That did it, that's it
[16:47:02] <claytonzaugg> Needed to be inside document ready.  I thought... well I thought wrong, I was thinking because it's something that can be triggered even after the document is ready, to keep it outside of that.
[16:47:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:47:12] <claytonzaugg> Don't know why I was thinking that, but I was wrong
[16:47:20] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[16:47:35] <robertmaxrees> .on() just binds something - that part runs whenever it runs.
[16:47:42] <claytonzaugg> yeah, it's what happens when you're not comfortable with all the things yet :)
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> the handler itself can run whenever.
[16:47:51] <claytonzaugg> That makes sense then.
[16:48:06] <robertmaxrees> so in this case, you want .on() to run only when the html exists, so-to-speak
[16:50:20] <claytonzaugg> okay
[16:53:29] <temhaa> I have lots of table : something like that: https://jsfiddle.net/mznpx1ac/
[16:53:48] <temhaa> about 45-50.
[16:53:54] <robertmaxrees> 45-50 what?
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> cells in a table?
[16:54:34] <temhaa> I have 45-50 table. One table is something like that.
[16:54:47] <robertmaxrees> wow, okay.
[16:54:56] <arc_> D:
[16:55:13] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[16:55:15] <temhaa> I want to get Name, Org, Country, Email information each row of each table
[16:55:23] <temhaa> How can I do?
[16:55:29] <robertmaxrees> regex.
[16:55:39] <temhaa> I coulnd't use that
[16:55:40] <temhaa> :(
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> you... don't have a choice.
[16:56:07] <temhaa> Actually my regex is not good
[16:56:31] <robertmaxrees> then learn.
[16:56:41] <temhaa> I tried jquery selector but it didnt work
[16:56:54] <robertmaxrees> because there's nothing to select.
[16:56:59] <robertmaxrees> it's a bunch of text.
[16:57:17] <robertmaxrees> the only jquery you can really effectively use here is to select the td.
[17:00:31] <temhaa> robertmaxrees: Yes I know so  I couldn't do. Is there another way to fix?
[17:00:58] <robertmaxrees> did you create this html or are you trying to scrape this from somewhere?
[17:02:03] <temhaa> robertmaxrees: I created
[17:02:17] <robertmaxrees> err, then start by fixing your html.
[17:02:46] <tkdaj1> does anyone know how to fix this problem: http://snag.gy/ukPgu.jpg
[17:02:54] <tkdaj1> it's a jquery-ui datepicker in a bootstrap modal
[17:03:06] <tkdaj1> Here is the code that goes with it: http://pastebin.com/Kp0sP3c0
[17:03:19] <temhaa> robertmaxrees: I created but I need deploy for this. I will takes lots of time. But I should fix shortly
[17:03:20] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle - you're more likely to get help that way.
[17:03:45] <robertmaxrees> temhaa then you'll have to learn regex.
[17:03:48] <robertmaxrees> pick one.
[17:04:44] <arc_> i would fix the html rather than try to learn regex if i were you ...
[17:05:01] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:05:07] <robertmaxrees> that html it pretty bad
[17:06:17] <robertmaxrees> temhaa why do you need that data via js anyway?
[17:07:23] <arc_> yeah, very strange...
[17:13:16] <temhaa> robertmaxrees: I dont need just javascript
[17:13:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:13:44] <temhaa> robertmaxrees: Important is to get data
[17:13:54] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to learn regex.
[17:14:09] <temhaa> robertmaxrees: Ok, thanks your reply
[17:15:15] <tkdaj1> okay, I have a different problem, but first can someone tell me why it says that showDatepicker is not defined here: https://jsfiddle.net/e0ts6zb0/3/
[17:16:05] <robertmaxrees> you're loading things weird.
[17:16:10] <tkdaj1> how?
[17:16:33] <robertmaxrees> you normally load jquery and jquery ui by the tool that jsfiddle gives you.
[17:16:59] <tkdaj1> isn't that what I did?
[17:17:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e0ts6zb0/4/
[17:17:12] <robertmaxrees> no - you use the cog icon next the the javascript heading.
[17:17:24] <tkdaj1> oh, I see
[17:17:45] <tkdaj1> okay, but it still says showDatepicker is not defined
[17:17:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you bind an event listener.
[17:17:54] <tkdaj1> is that because of something else?
[17:18:11] <tkdaj1> I thought I could just define the function and use onclick
[17:18:14] <robertmaxrees> yes - don't use onclick.
[17:18:20] <tkdaj1> oh
[17:18:32] <tkdaj1> what is onclick for, then?
[17:18:36] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[17:18:45] <robertmaxrees> onclick is the (broken) native DOM way.
[17:18:50] <arc_> it's for emergency use only :p
[17:18:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:19:02] <tkdaj1> Sorry, the majority of development I've done is all using angularjs which does things differently
[17:19:05] <arc_> basically just don't use it unless you have literally no other option
[17:19:14] <robertmaxrees> don't do things inline.
[17:19:16] <robertmaxrees> basically ever.
[17:19:26] <robertmaxrees> no style or onclick or any of that.
[17:19:27] <tkdaj1> oh, why?
[17:19:30] <tkdaj1> oh
[17:19:33] <tkdaj1> yeah, I see what you mean
[17:19:48] <robertmaxrees> let your html be html.  don't mix in your logic :) anyway, fix that binding and it'll work fine.
[17:20:09] <tkdaj1> okay, I'm going to fix that, but then I have another problem which is why I made the fiddle in the first place, lol
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> 2-fer then.
[17:21:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e0ts6zb0/5/
[17:21:34] <robertmaxrees> and it looks like on your site you're not loading the css for jquery ui.,
[17:23:11] <tkdaj1> uh, not it's giving me a cross origin error?
[17:23:11] <tkdaj1> https://jsfiddle.net/e0ts6zb0/8/
[17:23:15] <tkdaj1> now*
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm not getting htat.
[17:23:46] <robertmaxrees> but why aren't you using jquery for the event binding?
[17:24:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e0ts6zb0/10/
[17:24:26] <tkdaj1> not sure, I can switch it
[17:25:20] <robertmaxrees> ^ i just linked one that's fixed.
[17:25:45] <tkdaj1> Yeah, I see that. It also fixed the weird problem where the datepicker was partially behind the modal. I'm not sure why, though?
[17:25:49] <tkdaj1> it looks like the same HTml
[17:25:56] <robertmaxrees> i already answered that a while ago.
[17:26:06] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you weren't loading the jquery ui css in your page.
[17:26:09] <tkdaj1> oh
[17:26:12] <tkdaj1> derp
[17:26:26] <robertmaxrees> though i might check to see if there's a bootstrap datepicker instead.
[17:26:35] <robertmaxrees> since otherwise you're loading two entire frameworks when you don't need to.
[17:28:01] <tkdaj1> Thank you :D
[17:28:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:28:08] <tkdaj1> that fixed my issue
[18:10:52] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to get full page js and the scrollOverFlow option to work for me. This fiddle is an approximation of what the problem is: https://jsfiddle.net/xdwnvorp/
[18:11:06] <robertmaxrees> you need to load that extra js file.
[18:12:49] <robertmaxrees> the docs are pretty clear about that
[18:13:54] <islalobo> I have it loaded in my code so...
[18:15:04] <islalobo> @robertmaxrees updated https://jsfiddle.net/xdwnvorp/1/
[18:16:26] <robertmaxrees> "it requires the vendor plugin jquery.slimscroll.min and it should be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin."
[18:16:36] <robertmaxrees> you're not loading slimscroll before the plugin.
[18:18:23] <islalobo> I can't adjust the order on the fiddle. In my code the slimscroll is loaded before fullpage
[18:18:49] <robertmaxrees> sure you can - enter them in the external resources in the order they should load.
[18:21:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xdwnvorp/4/
[18:21:27] <robertmaxrees> try this maybe?>
[18:22:15] <islalobo> Okay, updated (and still presenting the same issue of not scrolling the overflow content) https://jsfiddle.net/xdwnvorp/5/
[18:22:29] <robertmaxrees> lkook at my last fiddle.
[18:24:15] <islalobo> But, it's more or less the same as my fiddle and also doesn't work
[18:24:25] <robertmaxrees> it works here.
[18:24:28] <islalobo> The form content should scroll to see the full form elements
[18:24:35] <robertmaxrees> when it's done scrolling that area, it goes to the next.
[18:25:00] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts here i think.
[18:25:22] <islalobo> Does the form scroll for you? it doesn't for me. No, I am basing my judgement of what should happen on the documentation that I've read.
[18:26:02] <robertmaxrees> the form isn't properly constrained for this to work right.
[18:26:22] <islalobo> What do you mean?
[18:26:57] <robertmaxrees> woah that navbar is causing a lof of weird stuff.
[18:26:57] <islalobo> For the scrolling example they don't mention anything about 'constraining' anything properly
[18:27:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xdwnvorp/6/
[18:27:10] <robertmaxrees> your markup and css isn't doing what you think it is.
[18:27:29] <islalobo> We're using bootstrap
[18:27:41] <robertmaxrees> just playing around duder.
[18:29:00] <islalobo> That's fine, appreciate it. Removing the navbar doesn't allow for the form to scroll though. I'm still not able to see the full form or footer area.
[18:29:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xdwnvorp/7/ making the viewport really narrow and then reloading seems to work fine.
[18:30:31] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to experiment and see what the issue is.
[18:31:09] <islalobo> Scrolling works better, but the the footer is still missing (I think I can add padding with fullpage.js plugin to fix the bottom area alignment). So, I'll have to fix the navbar. We copy/pasted it from the bootstrap example components. Bummer.
[18:31:29] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you're not using rows correctly?
[18:31:48] <islalobo> In our content or in the navbar
[18:31:49] <robertmaxrees> i dunno - bootstrap is funky.
[18:31:59] <robertmaxrees> never been very good with it myself.
[18:32:06] <islalobo> …I thought bootstrap was supposed to make life easier :/
[18:32:15] <robertmaxrees> it can if you use it right.
[18:32:58] <islalobo> Ugh, we're learning it now for a new project at the behest of manger. Which is fine, but learning something and using it correctly in time crunch can lead to …well, not using it correctly.
[18:33:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah... that's your problem.  if you're in a crunch, now's not the time.
[18:34:26] <islalobo> Blergh, tell that to my team. We've already hit the ground running, so to speak. At least removing the header makes the scrolling work a bit better which makes my head a little less frazzled.
[18:34:54] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you need to set up the center area as your scrollable section and leave the footer separate.
[18:36:19] <islalobo> That's is how it should be. Everything inside the <div class="fullpage"> is the 'scrolling sections' and the footer and navbar bar are separate.
[18:36:38] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, the padding thing should fix it.
[18:49:16] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: thanks for working through that with me. I don't have it yet, but I'm closer.
[18:49:19] <islalobo> robertmaxrees++
[18:49:57] <robertmaxrees> deffo man.  glad i could point you in the right direction.
[18:55:51] <robert_> so I'm trying to hook on an iframe so that I can remove some contents from the iframe before it's shown to the user
[18:57:35] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[19:04:13] <robert_> robertmaxrees: huh?
[19:04:24] <robert_> robertmaxrees: there's no really good way to do that?
[19:04:26] <robertmaxrees> (you didn't give us any other information)
[19:04:33] <robert_> oh, okay.
[19:04:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:04:51] <robertmaxrees> do you control the server the iframe is hosted on?
[19:06:11] <robert_> the server that contains the page with the iframe?
[19:06:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[19:06:17] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:06:27] <robertmaxrees> no - the server that has the actual page the iframe is on.
[19:07:38] <robertmaxrees> so you have your page on foo.com/somepage - on that page you have an iframe - is the src set to a page on the same domain as foo.com?
[19:07:59] <robert_> robertmaxrees: No, it's a different page. https://www.emsmed.com/(S(t4t5leka13a0klslnkujoujo))/drugpricing_zipcode.aspx
[19:08:12] <robertmaxrees> so CORS might be an issue.
[19:10:18] <robert_> okay.
[19:10:42] <robertmaxrees> which is why i asked.
[19:14:47] <robert_> does my apache server need to send headers to allow emsmed.com as a remote origin?
[19:15:09] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to embed emsmed.com into your page?
[19:15:13] <robert_> yes.
[19:15:19] <robertmaxrees> it needs to allow you to do CORS.
[19:17:10] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to embed that page into yours?
[19:19:39] <robert_> the url I gave you is a drug pricing website, however it's hostile to third-party programs like the one my company offers.
[19:19:57] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:20:04] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "hostile"?
[19:20:51] <robert_> meaning they promote a competing program on the pricing website.
[19:21:03] <arc_> lol...
[19:21:12] <robertmaxrees> that's... not hostile at all.
[19:21:43] <robert_> it's the same exact program, only it isn't us.
[19:21:54] <robertmaxrees> how is this hostile?
[19:22:09] <robertmaxrees> and how would iframing their search results onto your page help?
[19:22:10] <arc_> gotta be honest, it sounds like you're trying to steal data from them without giving them the benefits they have set up for themselves
[19:22:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:22:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, this sounds way sketch.
[19:23:09] <robert_> we have a contract with them; it's not sketchy at all.
[19:23:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm still way lost.
[19:23:29] <robert_> we just want to avoid the cross-promotion
[19:23:54] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you want to keep users on your site but use their search.
[19:25:04] <robertmaxrees> that sound about right?
[19:26:37] <arc_> so if you load a site into an iframe and the site's server does not allow cors, it's basically like a black box?
[19:27:05] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:27:12] <robertmaxrees> imagine if you could just access any page through an iframe.
[19:27:20] <arc_> yeah
[19:27:28] <robertmaxrees> i could craft a page with a hidden iframe to gmail and scrape your mail.
[19:27:40] <robertmaxrees> robert_ do i understand the issue correctly?
[19:28:52] <robert_> haha, so I'll have to ask them if they can add us into their CORS policy?
[19:29:01] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:29:07] <robertmaxrees> why do people flat-out ignore my questions?
[19:29:08] <robertmaxrees> it's salient.
[19:29:21] <robert_> and yes
[19:29:27] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of messed up, then.
[19:29:41] <robert_> we want to keep our users on our site, but use their search page.
[19:29:48] <robertmaxrees> you effectively want to steal their dev efforts and resources for your own page.
[19:29:54] <robertmaxrees> but they'll reap none of the benefits.
[19:30:06] <robert_> that's why they have a public website.
[19:30:10] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:30:26] <arc_> when you say you have a contract with them, what do you mean by that
[19:30:31] <arc_> are you paying them for access to this data?
[19:30:52] <robert_> essentially, yes.
[19:30:53] <robertmaxrees> they have a public website so people can go to their site and get access to that data with that branding.
[19:31:04] <robertmaxrees> "essentially" means "we're mad and claiming we do"
[19:31:19] <robertmaxrees> their site isn't there for you to abuse.
[19:31:23] <robert_> No, the contract makes the difference.
[19:31:34] <robertmaxrees> i somehow doubt the contract condones what you're trying to do.
[19:32:08] <robertmaxrees> because what you're trying to do sounds pretty sketchy.
[19:34:14] <digidog> hi! does anyone here now about a independent image size management script or jQuery plugin for loading optimized images regarding screen size supporting the caching of several sizes or such ?
[19:34:27] <robertmaxrees> digidog that's not a job for javascript.
[19:34:32] <robertmaxrees> digidog you need to do that server-side.
[19:35:29] <digidog> robertmaxrees: thanks for your fast reply. yes the resizing, you're right, but the indication. I think it will be sth in combination
[19:35:39] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:35:45] <digidog> robertmaxrees: nope?
[19:35:58] <robertmaxrees> "regarding screen size" is a server-side concern.
[19:36:10] <robertmaxrees> should be using responsive design for that.
[19:36:13] <digidog> robertmaxrees: from where does server side scriupt know about screen size or needed image size?
[19:36:44] <robertmaxrees> what kinds of images are these?
[19:37:31] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i guess you could look at matchmedia and go from there but something here seems overly... optimized.
[19:38:41] <digidog> robertmaxrees: its not a "I need a solution" question. I think of building it if not there. Many CMS support a combination of php/js to support such kind of thing. in Drupal it is called image-styles depending on the different sizes of the same image needed.
[19:39:18] <digidog> robertmaxrees: I thought of making it CMS independent or looking if already exist
[19:39:20] <robertmaxrees> those tools are normally to support a thumbnail on a page and then serve up a full-sized image on click from what i've seen.
[19:39:30] <digidog> robertmaxrees: true
[19:39:43] <arc_> i think this is what you're looking for https://github.com/Retina-Images/Retina-Images
[19:39:45] <digidog> robertmaxrees: but I still brainstorm on this
[19:40:20] <digidog> arc_: this looks interesting!
[19:40:51] <digidog> robertmaxrees: have you ref. to this? https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/
[19:41:02] <robertmaxrees> have i what?
[19:41:11] <digidog> robertmaxrees: when you have mentioned matchmedia
[19:41:19] <digidog> diod you have referred to this ?
[19:41:21] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia
[19:41:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably direct your question over to #web though.
[19:42:26] <digidog> robertmaxrees: arc_: sorry for confusion. anf thanks for your thoughts on this!
[19:43:22] <digidog> arc_: thanks for the link. quite close to what I have in mind.
[19:48:08] <digidog> robertmaxrees: basically your are right with the assumption but I wasn't sure where to start. probably some of the Angular js etc. frameworks already support this. I just wanted to throught the question into the room. thanks again for your fast reply and time.
[20:56:14] <Horacsio> hi. I need to check if a div has any of the following words: cancelled or annullée. https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lo1y88/1/
[20:58:54] <Horacsio> anyone please?
[21:00:09] <drej> Horacsio: https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lo1y88/2/
[21:00:41] <Horacsio> drej: portuguese?
[21:02:01] <drej> negative
[21:02:12] <Horacsio> ok :)
[21:02:17] <Horacsio> thank you :)
[21:02:45] <drej> Horacsio: https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lo1y88/3/
[21:02:51] <drej> if you need it to be a single selector you can do it that way
[21:03:32] <Horacsio> the thing is the element is under this: #post-121 > .woocommerce > .woocommerce-error > li
[21:04:28] <drej> so adjust the selector, tahts easy
[21:10:20] <Horacsio> drej: I know this sounds stupid but I need to add thisClass to a div https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lo1y88/5/
[21:11:02] <Horacsio> more like this: https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lo1y88/6/
[21:12:30] <drej> ...
[21:12:39] <drej> youre doing it wrong
[21:12:47] <drej> what i gave you will work
[21:15:41] <Horacsio> but I need to add a class to a another div: https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lo1y88/7/
[21:17:53] <drej> you need to add the class to the parent element?
[21:18:03] <Horacsio> yes
[21:20:23] <drej> https://jsfiddle.net/pudly/c7Lo1y88/8/
[21:20:48] <drej> you should be doing this at the point where you're rendering the dom
[21:20:57] <drej> and setting a class that way
[22:07:11] <Horacsio> I’m fitting here with this: https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lo1y88/12/ and I need to address that instead of .woocommerce-error, to .woocommerce how to?
