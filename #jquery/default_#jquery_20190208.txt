[13:18:11] <SimonKALI> how to do like and unlike button using external request
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> you mean, like, save that the user clicked that button?
[13:19:21] <SimonKALI> when I click like, on website will show up +1 and request to php file to add the record
[13:19:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not too hard.  where are you getting stuck?
[13:20:28] <SimonKALI> I didnt start yet, I wanna know how to do in best way
[13:20:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:20:39] <taplar> lots of different ways
[13:20:45] <taplar> "best" is vague
[13:20:48] <SimonKALI> taplar, i know
[13:21:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:21:23] <robertmaxrees> if you knwo that, then why'd you ask?
[13:21:55] <SimonKALI> robertmaxrees, I know that is "lots of different ways"
[13:22:19] <robertmaxrees> why not try to build it first and then ask if you get stuck?
[13:22:27] <taplar> at it's core, you're essentially talking about having an element that you click that triggers an ajax request, or a form submit
[13:22:28] <robertmaxrees> the basic setup is pretty basic.
[13:24:06] <taplar> you gotta figure out if you want ajax or form submit, how do you track who clicked the like, can they unlike, providing the info to the request of which thing to adjust.  lots of stuff
[13:52:17] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:54:15] <bestdesign1> hey robertmaxrees
[13:54:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:54:31] <bestdesign1> i just say hello :P
[13:54:39] <robertmaxrees> oh heh.  hello.
[14:07:11] <The_Photographer> hi guys, how I could get the more close parent with a class, for example <div><div class=my_parent><div><div><span>I want get my parent with the class "my_parent"</span></div></div></div></div>
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> .closest
[14:07:42] <The_Photographer> Im using $(this).closest('.my_parent') but its not working
[14:07:48] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[14:07:49] <taplar> it's not a parent of the span
[14:07:57] <robertmaxrees> oooooh taplar+++
[14:08:18] <taplar> it's the parent's sibling
[14:08:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd .closest() to a shared container and then .find() to the element you want.
[14:11:00] <The_Photographer> i did a console.log and it show a array of a element
[14:11:13] <The_Photographer> with my parent in the first elemenet
[14:11:21] <robertmaxrees> a console.log() of what?
[14:11:41] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be super helpful :)
[14:14:29] <The_Photographer> jQuery.fn.initÂ [div#my_parent, prevObject: jQuery.fn.init(1)]
[14:14:39] <robertmaxrees> make a js fiddle pls
[14:14:55] <The_Photographer> i cant but thanks
[14:14:59] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:15:01] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:16:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gLmukdfa/1/
[14:17:02] <robertmaxrees> seems like a straightforward one to me The_Photographer
[14:19:57] <The_Photographer> look https://jsfiddle.net/o8xzen7f/
[14:20:08] <The_Photographer> but I cant see it visually in the elements explorer of chrome
[14:20:16] <The_Photographer> when the data attribute is created
[14:20:30] <taplar> it will not be there
[14:20:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:20:39] <taplar> data elements set by jQuery are stored in memory
[14:20:42] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't modify the node.
[14:20:45] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:21:03] <The_Photographer> robertmaxrees: but it will be there?
[14:21:16] <robertmaxrees> notice how your console.log() still returns true?
[14:21:22] <taplar> So, for future reference.  "my selector is not working" vs "I can't see my data element in the inspector" are completely different issues
[14:21:25] <robertmaxrees> *prints true, fwiw.
[14:21:26] <The_Photographer> yes but its inside that context
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> that means the .data() is working fine.
[14:21:44] <The_Photographer> taplar: well, sorry, english is not my mother language
[14:21:55] <robertmaxrees> what does context have to do with it?
[14:22:06] <taplar> If you seeing a problem, say what problem you are seeing
[14:22:28] <The_Photographer> if i try get the data attribute from another element I will get it or its just disponible on that context?
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> The_Photographer it's tied to that element.
[14:23:11] <robertmaxrees> let me show you how you'd test that in the future.
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> since it sounds like you didn't actually try :p
[14:23:49] <The_Photographer> robertmaxrees: :|
[14:24:06] <The_Photographer> you are right
[14:24:10] <The_Photographer> sorry
[14:24:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> why didn't you try earlier?
[14:25:27] <The_Photographer> I thought that my code was too complex to reproduce, I thought it was another problem, sorry
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> heh.  more was asking why you didn't try fetching the data like that in your own codebase, but okie :)
[15:16:11] <The_Photographer> Robdgreat: anyway thanks mate
[15:16:39] <The_Photographer> sorry the message was for robert
[15:42:16] <bestdesign1> how can check trim on keyup? if there have then remove it?
[15:42:18] <bestdesign1> https://jsfiddle.net/phx2vzq3/
[17:51:52] <cryptopsy> how do i load an image on hover?
[17:52:01] <cryptopsy> should i use pure js or jquery?
[17:52:18] <robertmaxrees> either?
[17:52:34] <robertmaxrees> depends on a few factors.
[17:52:42] <cryptopsy> the direct links are not in the file, just their location
[17:52:51] <cryptopsy> (containing folder has multiple images)
[17:52:54] <robertmaxrees> more like - are you already using jquery?
[17:52:58] <cryptopsy> yes
[17:53:13] <cryptopsy> and jqui
[17:53:18] <robertmaxrees> then why not use it?
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> (feels like I missing some context heh)
[17:54:33] <cryptopsy> context is i dont have the names of the images
[17:54:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that has to do with your original question.
[17:54:58] <taplar> how would you load them then?
[17:55:08] <cryptopsy> i have the name of their location (folder)
[17:55:15] <taplar> doesn't answer teh question
[17:55:34] <cryptopsy> that was my question, if i was answeing it myself why would i ask it
[17:55:38] <robertmaxrees> back way up.  do you mean to ask if you can, like, scan the directoryu using js or jquery?
[17:55:51] <cryptopsy> yes that is part of the question
[17:55:58] <robertmaxrees> ....
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:56:04] <taplar> js doesn't scan folders
[17:56:04] <robertmaxrees> okay well nope.
[17:56:07] <robertmaxrees> not with client-side js.
[17:56:27] <robertmaxrees> imagine how dangerous it would be if client-side js could just arbitrarily scan directories on a remote machine
[17:56:37] <cryptopsy> what if the files are numbered, i could guess them
[17:56:43] <cryptopsy> 1.jpg 2.jpg etc
[17:56:47] <taplar> sure
[17:56:50] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) if you're willing to deal with that, sure.
[17:56:57] <taplar> if there is a predictable pattern, you can guess
[17:57:19] <cryptopsy> how do i guess load them without loading a file that oesnt actually exist so that blank squares arent created
[17:57:33] <taplar> $.get(), if you get an error, doesn't exist
[17:57:34] <robertmaxrees> what are you hoving over?
[17:57:43] <robertmaxrees> *hovering
[17:57:45] <cryptopsy> a li or <a href>
[17:57:53] <cryptopsy> text basically
[17:57:57] <robertmaxrees> why don't you attach the filenames to the li or anchor?
[17:58:08] <cryptopsy> because there might be 4 images, there might be 5 ..
[17:58:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:58:25] <cryptopsy> i hover on text to display some preview images
[17:58:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have some oddly structured data.
[17:58:32] <cryptopsy> i dont know exactly how many there are
[17:58:50] <robertmaxrees> how would you know how many to show?
[17:59:06] <cryptopsy> its a slideshow they dont all show at once, it just like , rolodexes them
[17:59:08] <taplar> <li data-previews="['url1', 'url2', 'url3']">Product 1</li>
[17:59:35] <cryptopsy> so i would have a js loop to attempt to load 1, 2, all the way to say 25
[17:59:36] <robertmaxrees> i would have your server-side look at the directory and generate a list that way, then.
[17:59:41] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[17:59:49] <robertmaxrees> don't use JS to "test" like that.
[18:00:05] <robertmaxrees> have your server just look at the directory and nab a list instead.
[18:00:56] <cryptopsy> i will get around to doing that someday i suppose, guess ill just guess-load the first 5 for now for testing
[18:01:07] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea (shrug)
[18:01:11] <robertmaxrees> but okie.
[18:01:27] <cryptopsy> its accemptable, this is running locally, and gives me previews for my bookmarks page
[18:01:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:02:15] <taplar> wait.... what?  your bookmarks are images?
[18:02:22] <cryptopsy> no?
[18:02:28] <robertmaxrees> lolol
[18:02:31] <taplar> so how are you going to preview them?
[18:02:41] <cryptopsy> this is retarded
[18:02:45] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[18:02:47] <robertmaxrees> not an OK work
[18:02:49] <robertmaxrees> *word
[18:03:27] <taplar> "i hover on text to display some preview images"  "and gives me previews of my bookmarks page"
[18:03:47] <taplar> unless I'm confused, it sounds like you are trying to get preview images of webpages
[18:03:58] <cryptopsy> i said "for my bookmarks page" not "of my bookmarks page"
[18:04:18] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy still doesn't make sense.
[18:04:23] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually building?
[18:04:39] <cryptopsy> it makes sense, i could repeat it but that would only make you angrier
[18:04:46] <robertmaxrees> we're not mad?
[18:04:54] <taplar> largly confused
[18:04:58] <cryptopsy> there's a list, there's images
[18:04:58] <robertmaxrees> lol right.
[18:05:17] <robertmaxrees> what do the images have to do with the list?
[18:05:31] <cryptopsy> how could you possibly combine these two ideas for it to make sense in your head? I am under the impression that you are under the impression that my bookmarks page is an image, or something wild
[18:05:46] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[18:05:48] <robertmaxrees> chill.
[18:06:00] <cryptopsy> perhaps you are thinking the text letters are images, i have no idea where we're getting confused here
[18:06:19] <cryptopsy> :shrug:
[18:06:22] <robertmaxrees> you have multiple people trying to understand what you're trying to build to better help you.
[18:06:28] <cryptopsy> n=2 strong use case
[18:06:42] <cryptopsy> as a segway are you under the impression that i am mad?
[18:07:10] <taplar> so you have some sort of bookmarks page, that you are wanting to get images from some director(y/ies) to display on there
[18:07:17] <cryptopsy> i presume you've used a bookmarking tool, like say in chrome, within the past 24 hours
[18:07:30] <taplar> ok, ease up on the condescention
[18:07:33] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy there's no reason to be absurd and condescending.
[18:07:52] <cryptopsy> well i guess you can now see why i assumed you would be angry and get angrier
[18:08:05] <cryptopsy> taplar: the idea is bookmarks have preview images
[18:08:12] <cryptopsy> got better things to do than e-fight
[18:08:45] <taplar> so you're going after the meta data preview images that are stored in the folders?
[18:08:53] <cryptopsy> yes
[18:08:59] <taplar> ok
[18:09:03] <cryptopsy> well, where else would they be?
[18:09:10] <taplar> i have no clue dude
[18:09:17] <taplar> this idea and concept is in your head
[18:09:21] <cryptopsy> i am just trying to understand the reasoning here
[18:09:27] <taplar> i have no clue what you've thought up.  no one does, untill you explain it
[18:09:40] <cryptopsy> i explained it
[18:09:51] <cryptopsy> its not much to explain
[18:09:53] <robertmaxrees> ^ you started by asking if you should use jquery or vanilla js to do something, when that something wasn't really what you were asking for.
[18:09:55] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:10:02] <robertmaxrees> easy to see how your questions were confusing :)
[18:10:16] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal.
[18:10:35] <cryptopsy> if you changed the language to chinee but kept "li" "image preview" and "bookmarks" someone could figure it out, there's not much to figure out, there's one one way to display an image privew of a link
[18:10:48] <cryptopsy> so i am imagining that you are imaginging something really wild
[18:10:57] <robertmaxrees> please drop the condescending attitude.
[18:11:04] <cryptopsy> ..
[18:11:13] <cryptopsy> i mean i could deny that but there would be no point
[18:11:47] <cryptopsy> 01:02:08        taplar | wait.... what?  your bookmarks are images?
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> again, your description was initially confusing./
[18:12:08] <cryptopsy> sounds wild to me, i've never seen a bookmark that is an image in my life
[18:12:09] <taplar> and not dropping it
[18:12:09] <robertmaxrees> it's OK though.
[18:12:12] <robertmaxrees> please just move on.
[18:12:29] <cryptopsy> any other question are welcomed
[18:12:42] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:12:43] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[18:12:45] <taplar> wut?
[18:12:48] <cryptopsy> ??
[18:12:57] <cryptopsy> doesn't sound like you want me to drop it
[18:12:59] <robertmaxrees> just drop it and move on.
[18:13:04] <cryptopsy> agreed
[18:13:53] <cryptopsy> you sound surprised that i keep my bookmarks in text file
[18:14:01] <cryptopsy> its because i can edit them with vim
[18:14:08] <robertmaxrees> last warning.
[18:14:12] <cryptopsy> don't like to drag and drop
[18:14:21] <cryptopsy> i use a tiling window manager, it is really efficient
[18:14:49] <robertmaxrees> congrats.  please drop the subject and move back to the topic.  thank you.
[18:15:50] <cryptopsy> so, that's the context
[18:16:14] <cryptopsy> i might do some stuff with key presses in js
[18:23:22] <cryptopsy> how can i not create the empty blocks for imagess that cannot be loaded (missing file)?
[18:23:36] <robertmaxrees> do the creation in the .then() callback for ajax.
[18:23:49] <robertmaxrees> if you get a 404, don't make the preview.
[18:24:03] <cryptopsy> don't unstand 'do the creation'
[18:24:18] <robertmaxrees> show me your code.
[18:24:23] <robertmaxrees> via jsfiddle :)
[18:24:24] <taplar> what are you calling an empty block?
[18:24:34] <cryptopsy> define calling
[18:24:43] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle pls.
[18:24:53] <cryptopsy> how can i jfiddle, i have nothing yet
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> so then... how do you have this question?
[18:25:11] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't create the image tag.
[18:25:16] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) ezpz.
[18:25:19] <taplar> you asked how to not create the empty blocks.  what is an "empty block"?
[18:25:59] <cryptopsy> its what shows when you do an <img src> to something that doesnt exist. The css can specify a size, say 500px by 500px
[18:26:16] <taplar> so, you're creating img tags dynamically
[18:26:16] <cryptopsy> i called it a block because im not sure if its a square or a rectangle
[18:26:18] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah, you don't create the image node in the first place for that anchor.
[18:26:25] <taplar> ^^
[18:26:29] <taplar> err, ^^^
[18:26:41] <cryptopsy> so i figure have to check with js if the files exist
[18:26:52] <taplar> thus the 404 thing robert said
[18:26:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:27:42] <cryptopsy> so this is a function, how do i string this function with a pug mixin?
[18:28:02] <robertmaxrees> does pug have client-side rendering?
[18:28:26] <cryptopsy> i think so yes, right now i'm generating all my li and img's from a js objey of objects of objects
[18:28:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked :)
[18:28:54] <cryptopsy> define client-side rendering
[18:29:02] <robertmaxrees> does it render in the browsers.
[18:29:08] <robertmaxrees> *browser
[18:29:12] <robertmaxrees> looks like according to https://pugjs.org/api/reference.html it can
[18:29:30] <cryptopsy> pug-static converts to html which renders in the browser
[18:29:32] <robertmaxrees> so could use ajax or something else to test if the image exists.  if so, render out the image tag.
[18:30:11] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy yeah, when we say "client-side rendering" we mean "run in the browser"
[18:30:27] <cryptopsy> then i would answer no because the browser doesnt understand pug
[18:30:41] <cryptopsy> frankly i am surprised you answered yes and i dont understand why
[18:30:43] <robertmaxrees> https://pugjs.org/api/reference.html says it can work.
[18:30:56] <robertmaxrees> pug can run in the browser.
[18:30:57] <cryptopsy> but its calling pug in the backend to convert to html
[18:31:23] <robertmaxrees> then you will need to set it up to also run in the browser.
[18:31:29] <cryptopsy> i see that page, just i dont think qtwebengine knows nay pug
[18:31:31] <cryptopsy> any*
[18:31:44] <cryptopsy> actually, i would say it does not, if my nodejs server wasnt running with pug-static the browser would not render pug
[18:32:55] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/5p3XMQT.png
[18:33:02] <robertmaxrees> this means it can run in the browser.
[18:33:06] <cryptopsy> do you use the imgur upload script?
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> i use a tool called greenshot.
[18:33:26] <robertmaxrees> but pug supports client-side rendering.
[18:33:43] <cryptopsy> hmm
[18:33:45] <robertmaxrees> so if you want to use it in the browser, you'll need to make sure it gets included
[18:33:57] <robertmaxrees> in whatever bundle or w/e you're using.
[18:34:02] <cryptopsy> so if you connected to my server and request a page written in pug, how would you client-side render it?
[18:34:15] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[18:34:57] <cryptopsy> i was using graphicsmagic import pipe to imgur.sh but i guess they updated the site so that no longer works for me to quickly share screenshots which are useful, like when im trying to describe things
[18:35:06] <robertmaxrees> offtopic.
[18:35:10] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[18:35:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else to rephrase what i'm saying.  pug can run both on your server and on the client.
[18:35:32] <cryptopsy> figured you might be using that too since you provided a screenshot fast
[18:35:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm using greenshot
[18:36:07] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like to render something as a result of an ajax call, then you need to either do it manually or include pug client-side.
[18:37:11] <robertmaxrees> or any of a number of other templating engines
[18:42:47] <gambl0re> haha you removed my ban?
[18:42:54] <cryptopsy> ^lol
[18:43:01] <robertmaxrees> most bans are removed automatically after 24 hours.
[18:43:09] <gambl0re> LMAO!
[18:43:16] <cryptopsy> its not a ban if its not for life
[18:43:21] <robertmaxrees> sure it is.
[18:43:32] <robertmaxrees> it stops somebody from entering.
[18:43:58] <cryptopsy> what is it called when a ban is longer than a human's life?
[18:44:03] <robertmaxrees> permaban
[18:44:13] <cryptopsy> i thought perma was never expires
[18:45:06] <cryptopsy> i think will have the last laugh on my 99 year ban from the linux channel thanks to innovations in modern medicine
[18:45:16] <cryptopsy> :D
[18:45:25] <gambl0re> robert, you crack me up
[18:45:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:51:05] <cryptopsy> can js create image tags for me or do they have to be there from the start and i have to update their srcs?
[18:51:21] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy you can create them using native JS or jQuery
[18:53:23] <cryptopsy> how do direct where to createElement?
[18:53:36] <robertmaxrees> would you rather use jquery or native JS?
[18:53:43] <cryptopsy> lets try both
[18:53:56] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like native js, head to ##javascript.
[18:54:05] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, we can talk about the jQuery way :)
[18:54:16] <cryptopsy> i am reading the js way so go ahead
[18:54:40] <robertmaxrees> oh, so you haven't actually researched the jquery way.
[18:54:47] <robertmaxrees> feel free to google around and let us know when you get stuck :)
[18:55:32] <cryptopsy> so i can append to div
[18:55:40] <taplar> https://learn.jquery.com is a pretty good starting point
[18:55:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:56:18] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/ for the comprehensive api docs
[18:56:25] <cryptopsy> so i need to call a function on hover and then .append to a div
[18:56:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.  you'll call $.ajax() probably.
[18:56:54] <cryptopsy> dont know what that does
[18:57:07] <robertmaxrees> that's how you'll check to see if the image will return a 404.
[18:57:44] <taplar> i would recommend using the HEAD method in this case
[18:57:51] <cryptopsy> i was planning on using complete property from createElement or whatever equivalent i find in jq
[18:58:01] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:58:05] <robertmaxrees> then use the JS :)
[19:04:50] <cryptopsy> how do i set the contents of a div?
[19:04:57] <cryptopsy> append will not do what i want
[19:05:06] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried searching for?
[19:05:17] <cryptopsy> jquery set image in div
[19:05:44] <robertmaxrees> have you run through the jquery tutorial?
[19:05:56] <cryptopsy> no
[19:06:09] <robertmaxrees> oh!  give it a shot :) it'll give you a great rundown of the basics.
[19:06:35] <cryptopsy> i have to do like at least 5 chapters before it gets to the answer to my question right?
[19:06:59] <robertmaxrees> spend a little time now to learn to want and you'll later be able to run.
[19:07:05] <robertmaxrees> *walk
[19:07:14] <cryptopsy> likely to forget it all
[19:07:23] <robertmaxrees> it's actually pretty intuitive! :)
[19:07:30] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot!
[19:07:36] <cryptopsy> i am sure it is, but i will forget what i dont use
[19:07:42] <robertmaxrees> that's fine./
[19:08:03] <robertmaxrees> it'll be in your back pocket for later :)
[19:08:09] <cryptopsy> at least if i have my little projects i am not likely to forget it
[19:08:43] <cryptopsy> rome wasn't built in a day, ya know?
[19:09:28] <robertmaxrees> fair.
[19:09:32] <cryptopsy> that's why i prefer to use reference manuals. And if i forget, will i do the jquery tutorial all over again?
[19:09:41] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/ for the reference :)
[19:10:23] <cryptopsy> so i see like, .before .append
[19:10:36] <robertmaxrees> you want to append an element to another, right?
[19:10:46] <cryptopsy> i want to set the contents of a div
[19:10:54] <robertmaxrees> can you show me what you mean?
[19:10:54] <cryptopsy> not append after it
[19:10:59] <robertmaxrees> append isn't after.
[19:11:01] <cryptopsy> <div> contents </div>
[19:11:11] <robertmaxrees> append means "insert as last child in the selected element"
[19:11:12] <cryptopsy> also append doesnt clear previous contents
[19:11:35] <robertmaxrees> so you want to empty the element and then append new contents?
[19:11:49] <cryptopsy> well that was my question
[19:11:57] <cryptopsy> do i need to clear it and then appead each time?
[19:12:03] <cryptopsy> or is there a function that does that already
[19:12:30] <cryptopsy> intuitively i would have cleared it, but that would have been ugly if there was already a function to do it
[19:12:32] <robertmaxrees> there's .html() and .text(), but i'd go with .empty().append() personally.
[19:15:11] <robertmaxrees> interestingly, all of that is covered very early on learn.jquery.com
[19:15:16] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/manipulating-elements/ :)
[19:15:57] <cryptopsy> it is normal for any tutorial to cover the majority of its api
[19:16:09] <robertmaxrees> yep!  self-service and all that :L)
[19:16:12] <robertmaxrees> *:)
[19:16:57] <robertmaxrees> just responding to your concern that you would "[...] have to do like at least 5 chapters [...]"
[19:17:08] <cryptopsy> the answer is "yes"
[19:17:18] <robertmaxrees> they're short chapters lol
[19:17:21] <cryptopsy> tutorials are never as good as the api
[19:17:23] <cryptopsy> anyways
[19:17:35] <robertmaxrees> *api reference docs
[19:17:50] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[19:17:54] <cryptopsy> they will show usage wihle api ref will emphasize structure
[19:18:02] <robertmaxrees> api ref shows usage, as well.
[19:18:08] <robertmaxrees> for jquery at least.
[19:18:12] <cryptopsy> thats what i said
[19:18:23] <cryptopsy> this is desired
[19:18:34] <robertmaxrees> your phrasing didn't make that clear :/
[19:18:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[19:18:51] <robertmaxrees> just trying to give you the tools to be successful.
[19:19:13] <cryptopsy> there is enough applied compsci for a lifetime of reading, it is important ot be as efficient as possible
[19:19:28] <robertmaxrees> hence why the learning center exists :)
[19:19:31] <robertmaxrees> but hey, your choice.
[19:19:34] <robertmaxrees> moving on then.
[19:19:55] <cryptopsy> it is better to learn the usage from syntax form than from examples
[19:20:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm just trying to help you avoid having to keep asking basic questions.
[19:20:22] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[19:20:33] <cryptopsy> this is apparent
[19:21:03] <robertmaxrees> especially since the channel guidelines ask that you provide a fiddle showing what you've tried
[19:21:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:21:53] <cryptopsy> the trying has only recently begun
[19:22:03] <cryptopsy> i am writing a for loop, it will succeed
[19:22:24] <cryptopsy> it merely increments n to 20
[19:22:36] <robertmaxrees> congrats?
[19:22:52] <cryptopsy> not much to be gained from jsfiddling that
[19:22:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:23:01] <cryptopsy> i need to populate it with more interesting things
[19:25:21] <cryptopsy> do you use a text editor ?
[19:25:39] <robertmaxrees> as most software engineers these days, would answer - yes
[19:25:50] <cryptopsy> well, you could be using an IDE
[19:26:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:26:11] <robertmaxrees> I use VScode these days
[19:26:21] <robertmaxrees> for 95% of my work.
[19:27:38] <cryptopsy> it is written in js
[19:27:46] <robertmaxrees> indeed.
[19:27:57] <cryptopsy> is it slow on big files?
[19:28:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:28:10] <robertmaxrees> very performant.
[19:28:48] <cryptopsy> vim lags when running macros on big files, say full lines top to bottom, despite being written in C
[19:29:32] <robertmaxrees> define "big files"?
[19:29:35] <robertmaxrees> and what kinds of macros?
[19:29:51] <robertmaxrees> also, the machine itself can have limitations.
[19:30:00] <cryptopsy> full lines top to bottom, macro say to go to 'www' and prepend http:// to it
[19:30:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd autoprepend https fwiw :)
[19:30:35] <cryptopsy> full syntax coloring
[19:30:51] <cryptopsy> can vscode be demoed online?
[19:30:58] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[19:30:59] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[19:31:17] <cryptopsy> i was not able to find such a thing, but maybe some obscure hipster out there has done it
[19:31:33] <robertmaxrees> https://stackblitz.com/
[19:31:39] <robertmaxrees> looks like this is an online version :)
[19:32:25] <robertmaxrees> though i'd just download it and run in locally.  no reason not to that i can think of.
[19:32:53] <cryptopsy> i like to try shoes out before i take them /home/
[19:33:02] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) alright
[19:33:49] <cryptopsy> did MS acquire github yet?
[19:34:00] <robertmaxrees> yes.  a while ago.
[19:34:26] <robertmaxrees> announced June 4th of 2018
[19:34:46] <cryptopsy> they confirmed they were acquiring github on june 4th
[19:34:59] <robertmaxrees> the agreement.
[19:35:01] <robertmaxrees> and so what?
[19:35:04] <robertmaxrees> same diff.
[19:35:09] <cryptopsy> so that is merely the legal agreement
[19:35:15] <robertmaxrees> your point?
[19:35:26] <cryptopsy> i want to see what changes MS made/makes
[19:35:36] <robertmaxrees> they aleady announce free private repos.
[19:35:42] <robertmaxrees> nothing else has really changed so far.
[19:35:46] <robertmaxrees> https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete
[19:35:48] <robertmaxrees> here you go.
[19:35:58] <cryptopsy> i have been on that page for 5mins
[19:35:59] <robertmaxrees> october of last year - they "completed" the acquisition.
[19:36:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:36:17] <cryptopsy> make its just a market acquisition and the product will not change
[19:36:18] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[19:37:02] <cryptopsy> oct26 microsoft completes github acquisition
[19:37:20] <robertmaxrees> i have seen this information already
[19:37:20] <cryptopsy> that was fast
[19:37:37] <robertmaxrees> they made it pretty apparently that MS wasn't interested in really cahnging that much.
[19:37:41] <robertmaxrees> *changiong
[19:37:46] <robertmaxrees> wtf i can't type today.
[19:39:21] <cryptopsy> > After the excellent job they did with Nokia, I have nothing but good feelings on how this might turn out.
[19:39:35] <cryptopsy> oh well, life goes on
[19:39:38] <robertmaxrees> so... got anything for the topic of the channel?
[19:41:03] <cryptopsy> can i run a function off hover (as opposed to onhover) ?
[19:41:15] <robertmaxrees> you mean when the mouse leaves an element?
[19:41:18] <cryptopsy> yes
[19:41:21] <robertmaxrees> .on('mouseleave'
[19:41:30] <robertmaxrees> there's also mouseenter
[19:41:37] <robertmaxrees> i would use those instead of "hover"
[19:42:37] <cryptopsy> haha, the example was only ~10 lines but they used a picture instead of a live demo https://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[19:42:57] <robertmaxrees> keep scrolling
[19:43:00] <robertmaxrees> there's a demo at the bottom
[19:43:52] <cryptopsy> i figured there would be bigger demos further down
[19:44:07] <cryptopsy> but it had me clicking repeatedly wondering if qtwebengine broke again
[19:44:09] <robertmaxrees> you mean like https://i.imgur.com/vPHFebX.png
[19:46:59] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, the docs include images sometimes.
[19:47:39] <cryptopsy> why do they do $( "div.overout" ) instead of just $( ".overout" ) ?
[19:48:20] <robertmaxrees> could be an oversight.
[19:49:09] <robertmaxrees> some of these haven't been updated in a while.  i'd suggesting using .on() instead of the convenience methods, personally.
[19:51:57] <cryptopsy> can i do .clear inside a (".classname").on("event", func(){ }) without refreing to it as (".classname").clear ?
[19:52:32] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler
[19:54:46] <robertmaxrees> also: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[19:54:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:55:01] <cryptopsy> i guess yes from the first example
[19:55:09] <robertmaxrees> they both explain it
[19:55:19] <robertmaxrees> there are multiple ways to
[19:55:45] <robertmaxrees> for instance, the first line literally says "When jQuery calls a handler, the this keyword is a reference to the element where the event is being delivered"
[19:56:02] <robertmaxrees> it also says "To create a jQuery object from the element so that it can be used with jQuery methods, use $( this )."
[19:56:43] <cryptopsy> so i can't do clear() i have to do this.clear()
[19:56:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:57:40] <robertmaxrees> you cannot randomly call jquery methods.  you must call them from a jquery object.
[20:01:58] <robertmaxrees> anyway - as you can see, the docs and learning center have everything you need.  i highly encourage just giving the learning center a quick runthrough.  it'll save you lots of time, even in the short term :)
[20:01:58] <robertmaxrees> have a good night!
[20:02:27] <cryptopsy> bye bye ~~
[20:46:14] <cryptopsy> .on("hover") didnt work for me, i had to use "mouseenter" instead
[20:46:25] <cryptopsy> don't know what's going on it should have worked
[20:46:33] <cryptopsy> nothing happened
[20:58:57] <cryptopsy> i am generating html li's in a for loop in a pug mixin, how can i pass some js vars used in those loops to a function trigged by an eventhandle acting on that li ?
[20:59:39] <cryptopsy> for example, when a li is hovered, i want to .append five images whos path is the title of that li
[21:40:18] <cryptopsy> i think pug supports .hover directly on elements, such as span.hover
[21:41:06] <robertmaxrees> looks like that's just shorthand to add a class.
[21:41:12] <robertmaxrees> not for event bindings
[21:41:33] <cryptopsy> true
[21:41:41] <robertmaxrees> which makes sense - templating engines generally don't handle adding logic.
[21:43:01] <cryptopsy> i found this example for button which uses the attribute onclick:   button(type='button' class=' c-btn-blue c-btn-circle c-btn-uppercase' value="Read More" onclick='gotoBlog(' + val.link + ')')
[21:43:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't use attrbitues for event bindings.
[21:43:26] <cryptopsy> why not?
[21:43:42] <cryptopsy> it might be the only way to do this
[21:43:46] <robertmaxrees> it tightly couples your logic and templates.
[21:43:48] <robertmaxrees> let me guess
[21:44:00] <robertmaxrees> your event bindings don't work with your dynamically created elements
[21:44:31] <cryptopsy> not even a function that appends works
[21:44:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:44:51] <cryptopsy> a function that appends text does not even work
[21:45:03] <cryptopsy> with the dynamically created elements loop
[21:45:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[21:45:08] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[21:45:11] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[21:45:21] <robertmaxrees> need to use event delegation for that.
[21:46:14] <cryptopsy> i need to pass the loop vars to the even handler
[21:46:25] <robertmaxrees> let me guess
[21:46:31] <cryptopsy> for example:
[21:46:32] <cryptopsy>       each link in Object.entries(cat[1])
[21:46:35] <cryptopsy>        //li: a(href= link[1])= link[0]
[21:46:39] <robertmaxrees> each element has data you'd like to associate to each element.
[21:46:41] <cryptopsy> this href needs to go to the even handler function
[21:46:58] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes for that.
[21:47:12] <robertmaxrees> and then have the event handler check if it's an "even" or and "odd".
[21:47:29] <robertmaxrees> or use classes to separate them, and go from there.
[21:47:42] <cryptopsy> which data attribute?
[21:48:06] <robertmaxrees> any - they're there for you to arbitrarily name them.
[21:48:13] <robertmaxrees> data-isEven
[21:48:23] <cryptopsy> i have no idea what you're talking about
[21:48:38] <robertmaxrees> <a href="#" data-someName="foo">
[21:48:57] <robertmaxrees> then in your event handler - $(this).data('someName');
[21:48:59] <cryptopsy> i have to pass that attribute to the even handler
[21:49:05] <cryptopsy> oooh
[21:49:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:49:16] <robertmaxrees> js has solved all of these problems already :)
[21:49:39] <cryptopsy> what is this called? data attribute passing??
[21:49:49] <robertmaxrees> they're just called data attributes.
[21:49:54] <robertmaxrees> you can read them in event handlers.
[21:49:57] <cryptopsy> i didnt know i could invent my own
[21:50:07] <robertmaxrees> ONLY with the data- prefix though.
[21:50:13] <cryptopsy> is that widely adopted?
[21:50:23] <cryptopsy> i mean do a wide variety of browsers support it?
[21:51:10] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery, it fills in the "gaps" for you.
[21:51:34] <robertmaxrees> if not, MDN and caniuse can tell you browser support.
[21:52:54] <robertmaxrees> but yes, most browsers support it.
[21:57:14] <cryptopsy> how do i append the attribute? is it $(this).append(data-someName); in the even handler function ?
[21:57:29] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:57:39] <robertmaxrees> you aren't appending it.
[21:57:41] <robertmaxrees> you're setting it.
[21:57:48] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('someName', 'foo');
[21:59:14] <cryptopsy> i thought it was set already 04:48:31 robertmaxrees | <a href="#" data-someName="foo">
[21:59:29] <robertmaxrees> then what do you mean by "append"?
[21:59:37] <robertmaxrees> you can't "append" an attribute.
[21:59:44] <robertmaxrees> you have to set it on an element.
[22:00:15] <cryptopsy>   $("li").on("mouseenter",function() {
[22:00:17] <cryptopsy>    $("#right").append("cow");
[22:00:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:00:28] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[22:00:39] <robertmaxrees> becuase that doesn't make any sense.
[22:00:39] <cryptopsy> so instead of cow, i would like to just pass that attribute
[22:01:02] <robertmaxrees> you mean you'd like to read the attribute.
[22:01:16] <cryptopsy> i dont understand that part, so maybe?
[22:01:27] <cryptopsy> right now it appends cow to #right as it should
[22:01:35] <robertmaxrees> earlier I said "then in your event handler - $(this).data('someName');"
[22:01:55] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('someName') gets the value
[22:02:05] <cryptopsy> what happens to it?
[22:02:11] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[22:02:15] <robertmaxrees> that just gets the value.
[22:02:20] <robertmaxrees> you have to pass it to your append from there.
[22:02:21] <cryptopsy> how can i pass it to a function inside the event handler?
[22:02:27] <robertmaxrees> really?
[22:02:43] <robertmaxrees> $("#right").append($(this).data('someName'));
[22:02:45] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[22:04:00] <robertmaxrees> have you not done any JS tutorials?
[22:04:15] <cryptopsy> i've done some over the years
[22:04:33] <cryptopsy> as you can tell this was a waste of time
[22:04:37] <cryptopsy> because i don't remember it
[22:04:42] <robertmaxrees> let me be more direct.
[22:05:19] <cryptopsy> i use js like once every 3 months, its just a hobby
[22:05:26] <robertmaxrees> you should really go find some resources on javascript basics that you can revisit.  it's often unproductive to come into chat rooms and ask basic questions that have been answered dozens of times through the many resources available to you.
[22:05:50] <cryptopsy> i'm juggling like, pug context, even handle context, the handler function context
[22:06:37] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[22:06:45] <robertmaxrees> pug just spits out markup.
[22:07:06] <cryptopsy> pug has mixins
[22:07:11] <cryptopsy> it has its own scope
[22:07:14] <robertmaxrees> which is still just spitting out markup.
[22:07:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:07:29] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating templating with javascript.
[22:08:00] <cryptopsy> so im doing this mixin in pug on a js obj of ojbs and i have to decide if the output is still in the same scope as the event handler
[22:08:11] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[22:08:17] <robertmaxrees> because pug is just spitting out templating.
[22:08:22] <robertmaxrees> you feed it data.  that's it.
[22:08:32] <robertmaxrees> well, spitting out markup.
[22:08:51] <cryptopsy> mmm
[22:09:08] <robertmaxrees> now, if you're talking about calling pug, it just takes whatever you call it with.
[22:09:17] <cryptopsy> this is a pug line in a mixing   each link in Object.entries(cat[1])
[22:09:20] <robertmaxrees> but it just transforms data into markup.
[22:09:38] <robertmaxrees> webdev101
[22:09:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:14:55] <cryptopsy> can i have an event handler on a "a" that is sibling to "li" ?   $("li a").on("mouseenter",function() {
[22:15:02] <cryptopsy> i think yes
[22:15:05] <robertmaxrees> woah wait.
[22:15:08] <robertmaxrees> you can'
[22:15:16] <robertmaxrees> *can't have an 'a' as a sibling of 'li'
[22:15:29] <robertmaxrees> a can be a child of li
[22:15:32] <robertmaxrees> but not a sibling.
[22:15:40] <cryptopsy> yes i think i meant child
[22:15:45] <robertmaxrees> then sure.
[22:15:48] <cryptopsy>   $("a").on("mouseenter",function() {
[22:15:51] <cryptopsy> oops
[22:15:55] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, too ;)
[22:16:15] <cryptopsy> the pug syntax confused me    li: a(href= link[1] data-path
[22:16:24] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[22:16:39] <cryptopsy> so li.a
[22:16:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:16:59] <robertmaxrees> in jquery land, li.a would be an li with a class of 'a'
[22:17:04] <robertmaxrees> when dealing with js/jquery, ignore your pug syntax and worry about what gets rendered.
[22:17:54] <robertmaxrees> so look at your inspector and follow that instead :)
[22:28:03] <cryptopsy> why are success/error/complete functions are deprecated in favor of promises ?
[22:28:32] <robertmaxrees> Because promises ultimately make much more sense for async code.
[23:22:14] <cryptopsy> how do you deal with async .get in a for loop? its supposed to load 5 different images 1 2 3 4 5 but the incremetor n is always 5
[23:23:27] <cryptopsy> i dont mind the image loading be async but the it is breaking loading 1 2 3 4 .. it just loads 5 5 5 5 5
