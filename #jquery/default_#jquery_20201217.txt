[04:20:25] <irthewinner> guys, how can I select in jquery: all the .cell classes but the ones with white background only?
[04:21:06] <Cork> irthewinner: you can't you can't select based on css properties
[04:21:17] <irthewinner> hmm
[04:21:18] <Cork> add a class for the background color and use that class name in the selector
[04:21:37] <Cork> .cell:not(.whitebg)
[04:21:38] <irthewinner> oh thanks mate :) it's also a good idea
[04:22:16] <undefined_bob> hey cork, are you alright?
[04:22:36] <Cork> been buzy as hell, but except for that fine
[04:22:51] <undefined_bob> glad to hear that :)
[04:22:54] <undefined_bob> take care
[04:23:15] <Cork> it's lovely when you get a project 9 a thirsdas morning, "this needs to be live by 15" and it isn't even specced how it should work yet
[04:23:19] <Cork> yay -_-
[04:23:40] <undefined_bob> lol no specs is always fun
[09:45:21] <ignacioca> Hi
[09:48:51] <ignacioca> I have a doubt I'm right now in Bolivia and I can't access to https://code.jquery.com/ it says i has to many redirections I can enter that url if I'm in a VPN in other Locations except Bolivia
[10:06:08] <pavonia> Can you check what it redirects too (e.g. using command-line tools like curl)?
[10:07:56] <Cork> pavonia: been reported a new times and event seen it go through in infrastructure
[10:08:01] <Cork> so it seams quite verified
[10:08:16] <Cork> though haven't seen anything in response from the ones handling the servers
[10:09:50] <pavonia> Weird
[10:10:15] <Cork> from yesterday: <arturo81> We have managed to replicate this for ourselves from couple of testing nodes in South America,
[10:10:15] <Cork> <arturo81> and looking further into it, it is most probably a result of misconfiguration on jQuery's end.
[10:10:39] <Cork> so ya, not sure what state jqeury is in but it starts to smell
[10:11:29] <Cork> and ya a user reporting the problem about ones every 4-5 hours
[10:27:47] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/9dkhvLpt/ would I use .find() or a combination of something else to reach class='content hidden' from <button>
[10:27:51] <robertparkerx> click*
[10:31:32] <robertparkerx> got it

[14:01:19] <mulch2> can someone help me understand why i get "function is not defined at HTMLTableCellElement.onclick" errors when the function is declared right inline. it's an onclick event, on a menu item in a "top.jsp" document. the function is put in the appropriate <script> tags...
[14:03:14] <mulch2> where is it expecting it to be?
[14:19:15] <robertmaxrees> mulch2 show the code.
[14:33:18] <robertmaxrees> mulch2 and actually - don';t use things like onclick :)
[15:22:26] <Bruno02468> hello. have any of you had issues with the code.jquery.com CDN? I'm getting a redirect loop but only when connecting from my IPv6 home network -- it works fine from IPv4  (phone 4G, or university VPN)
[15:23:57] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/67 known issue
[15:24:21] <robertmaxrees> Bruno02468
[15:25:44] <Bruno02468> woah, I had no idea, sorry
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> :) it's all good
[15:26:20] <Bruno02468> I'll keep an eye on that issue -- big thanks for the info!
[16:43:29] <robertparkerx> I'm trying to adjust this to go down from top 61px https://url.hashdev.org/54
[16:43:41] <robertparkerx> It goes to the same position
[16:43:48] <robertparkerx> Well same as before
[16:44:24] <robertmaxrees> var that = $(this); ?  are you in an event handler or something?
[16:44:37] <robertparkerx> yes
[16:44:42] <robertparkerx> it was there before
[16:44:45] <robertparkerx> I'm just trying to adjust
[16:44:58] <robertparkerx> oh I got it
[16:45:03] <robertparkerx> it should have been - 61
[16:45:03] <robertmaxrees> "down from top 61px" is where I'm getting lost :)
[16:45:08] <robertmaxrees> aaaah gotcha.
[16:45:20] <robertparkerx> I'm sorry
[16:45:23] <robertmaxrees> all good!

[22:28:45] <irthewinner> guys, how can I change content of DIV but not affect the inner span inside of it
[22:28:48] <irthewinner> i wanna change text only
[22:28:50] <irthewinner> of div
[22:29:03] <irthewinner> how can i do it with jquery?
[22:29:14] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner few different ways - make a fiddle and show us what your markup looks like.
[22:30:21] <irthewinner> <div id="label_p1">Score: <span id="score_p1">0</span></div>
[22:30:23] <irthewinner> the js:  $("#score_p1").text("0");
[22:30:35] <robertmaxrees> great!  mind popping that into a jsfiddle? :)
[22:30:41] <irthewinner> ok sec
[22:32:46] <irthewinner> here mate
[22:32:47] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/90xw76cb/
[22:33:07] <robertmaxrees> awesome!
[22:33:17] <irthewinner> my idea there is not to touch the "span" text there
[22:33:21] <robertmaxrees> clear on that.
[22:33:23] <irthewinner> when modifying labels
[22:33:32] <robertmaxrees> so i gotta start by asking - any reaspon for that particular markup structure?
[22:33:57] <irthewinner> no reason but i wanted to display it close to each other on same line
[22:34:07] <irthewinner> display score and text of score closer to each other
[22:34:29] <robertmaxrees> sure - my point is that the markup doesn't make sense in this case :)
[22:34:46] <irthewinner> why mate?
[22:35:22] <robertmaxrees> you're wrapping an element called "label" around the "score", which semantically doesn't make sense.  also makes what you're trying to do that much more difficult.
[22:35:30] <irthewinner> ah u mean i need to put the text into another span for the label div?
[22:35:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2dpjL6m1/ do this instead.
[22:35:57] <robertmaxrees> also: those IDs make me nervous...
[22:36:38] <irthewinner> ah yeah so I need to put it into another span hmm yeah sounds better
[22:37:10] <irthewinner> thanks for pointing this out mate ;)
[22:50:13] <robertmaxrees> sure
