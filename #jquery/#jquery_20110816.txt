[00:10:48] <whateverb> can anyone take a look?
[00:13:21] <silv3r_m00n> what happens if in an ajax request I don't specify the url ?
[00:13:26] <silv3r_m00n> will it submit to current page ?
[00:14:15] <justinTNT> whateverb your form needs an action
[00:15:59] <chjj> silv3r_m00n: why does it matter?
[00:16:06] <silv3r_m00n> I may not specify the url
[00:16:27] <chjj> window.location + '', theres your page
[00:18:04] <whateverb> justinTNT, http://jsbin.com/odedug/
[00:18:13] <whateverb> http://jsbin.com/odedug/2
[00:19:45] <whateverb> validator only sets border around first input and submitting, but I need border for all notvalid required fields and no submitting
[00:19:51] <justinTNT> we: no, action=posturl
[00:20:52] <whateverb> I have php action on the same page as the form, so I use action=""
[00:22:31] <chjj> you know, thats only conforming for compatibility reasons
[00:22:38] <justinTNT> oh, ok i see: you're returning false on the first matched field, so it doesnt get to do the others
[00:22:40] <chjj> put an id in there or something
[00:22:44] <chjj> or just action="#"
[00:23:12] <justinTNT> you should test the 'empty' flag after you've looped through each .required item
[00:27:49] <whateverb> tnx :)
[00:45:00] <SergSergiu> hello
[00:45:36] <MarcelT3> hi
[00:45:39] <MoTiOnXml> \o
[00:46:34] <SergSergiu> my menu tell me if one button is pushed " Chosed button : Links" and is needed to replace function , to open jq dialog, can help me someone to edit this function? http://pastering.com/11
[00:47:31] <SergSergiu> with id="theid" on <li> not running is needed to make function on menu.js :)
[00:51:35] <Dravekx> Hi.
[00:51:42] <SergSergiu> hello
[00:52:19] <Dravekx> can someone take a look at this and tell me why it's not working? http://jsfiddle.net/HuySG/5/
[00:53:05] <viraj> hey i had que when i try to resize jQuery dialog with dynamic data
[00:54:10] <SergSergiu> push jSLint on jsfiddle :))
[00:54:14] <JKarsrud> Dravekx: use e.preventDefault() instead, seems to work here :) http://jsfiddle.net/HuySG/6/
[00:54:44] <JKarsrud> see ?preventDefault
[00:54:45] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[00:54:47] <viraj> i set dialog width and height as auto when i creta dialog with dynamic data it works with fire fox 4.0 however question in IE7 dialog take whole window lengh as auto dialog title was not take auto width
[00:54:56] <Dravekx> ah thanks. I was about to ask about that :)
[00:55:26] <SergSergiu> my menu tell me if one button is pushed " Chosed button : Links" and is needed to replace function , to open jq dialog, can help me someone to edit this function? http://pastering.com/11
[00:55:31] <SergSergiu> with id="theid" on <li> not running is needed to make function on menu.js :)
[00:55:35] <SergSergiu> sry for repeat
[00:56:20] <seutje> Dravekx: there is no "elseif" in js, is there? innit just "else if"
[00:56:39] <Dravekx> seutje not sure. I'm learning.
[00:56:56] <Dravekx> I think it's possible.
[00:57:08] <SergSergiu> can help me someone with fuction?
[00:57:47] <seutje> oh, u think it's possible, my bad
[00:57:56] <Dravekx> JKarsrud do I leave e.preventDefault(); there when I copy the script to a live site?
[00:58:08] <JKarsrud> yes
[00:58:26] <Dravekx> JKarsrud cool. thanks.
[00:58:48] <JKarsrud> seutje: I fixed that error for him too ;)
[00:58:57] <JKarsrud> because I'm so cool
[00:59:24] <seutje> how nice of u not to mention it so he can go on making the same mistake not knowing why it errors out!
[00:59:45] <JKarsrud> Dravekx: btw, event.preventDefault() stops the default action from happening, and seeing as they were links, they'd try to go somewhere....
[01:00:09] <JKarsrud> seutje: gotta learn by doing, you know
[01:00:15] <JKarsrud> I forgot I fixed it, really
[01:00:17] <fotoflo> do bindings have to be anonymous functions?
[01:00:31] <JKarsrud> bindings = handlers?
[01:00:32] <seutje> no sir
[01:00:43] <seutje> if u mean .bind('somevent', someHandler)
[01:00:47] <fotoflo> yes
[01:00:49] <fotoflo> good
[01:01:20] <gnarf> i never really liked the term anonymous function
[01:02:05] <JKarsrud> why not?
[01:02:09] <chjj> ?
[01:02:18] <seutje> I never really liked the practise
[01:02:22] <JKarsrud> what do you suggest we call it gnarf? This is interesting
[01:02:26] <chjj> its an accurate term
[01:02:34] <chjj> i dont see what there is to dislike about it
[01:02:50] <JKarsrud> I never really liked anonymous people
[01:02:55] <gnarf> its not really anonymous most times
[01:02:55] <JKarsrud> :P
[01:03:02] <seutje> my god ur funny
[01:03:21] <gnarf> "function expression"
[01:03:22] <chjj> well if its not an anonymous function, its not an anonymous function
[01:03:47] <chjj> i dont see why that makes you call it an anonymous function and then dislike the term because you mislabeled it
[01:03:56] <gnarf> just because its not a "named" function doesn't mean its anonymous
[01:04:15] <fotoflo> so $(selector).click(myFunction); should work?
[01:04:16] <chjj> see my above messages ^
[01:04:31] <JKarsrud> fotoflo: yes
[01:04:37] <gnarf> chjj: give me one example of an "anonymous" function
[01:04:54] <gnarf> you've probably named it something :)
[01:05:05] <chjj> (function() {})() <-- anonymous
[01:05:25] <chjj> not tied to a name or variable or anything of the sort, at all
[01:05:47] <gnarf> closure
[01:05:48] <jita> could anybody help me with this script http://dpaste.com/595427/ ?
[01:05:50] <JKarsrud> that's an immediately invoked function expression, aint it?
[01:05:56] <fotoflo> hmm, networking. worked before when it was anon
[01:05:57] <gnarf> function expression
[01:06:00] <gnarf> again, still better
[01:06:01] <fotoflo> not working
[01:06:04] <chjj> yes, but its also an anonymous function
[01:06:09] <misterm> actually that exactly what an anonymous function is
[01:06:10] <chjj> and no its not a closure
[01:06:30] <JKarsrud> fotoflo: make a fiddle?
[01:06:30] <misterm> that's what "anonymous" means..."without name"
[01:06:33] <chjj> a closure is explicitly used to capture a scope, and keep indirect access to that scope
[01:06:40] <fotoflo> JKarsrud: err debugging
[01:06:55] <seutje> fotoflo: is myFunction defined with that scope?
[01:07:14] <seutje> misterm: that would be "nameless"
[01:07:27] <seutje> u can be anonymous and still have a name
[01:07:34] <seutje> eg _why
[01:07:42] <seutje> temp01
[01:07:45] <jita> This script is used to display title, if i click on title, it rolls down the contents of title. http://dpaste.com/595427/ . Could somebody please help with me?
[01:07:45] <seutje> ...
[01:08:09] <JKarsrud> fotoflo: http://jsfiddle.net/Jxk42/
[01:08:12] <JKarsrud> works like a charm
[01:08:16] <dr0id> charm!
[01:08:26] <misterm> seutje: the base word of "anonymous" is "onym" which in this contet means "name"
[01:08:37] <misterm> seutje: the prefix "an" indicates "without"
[01:08:50] <dr0id> and ous ? :P
[01:08:56] <fotoflo> hmmm it is working, but something else is messed up.
[01:08:58] <chjj> misterm: a very bad way to go about deciding what computer science terms mean
[01:09:02] <misterm> seutje: the literal definition of anonymous is something without a name, or with the name witheld in the current context
[01:09:26] <misterm> chjj: no, it's not because its the basis for the comp sci term
[01:09:30] <gnarf> i just never liked the term
[01:10:13] <chjj> misterm: so are a lot of things, try to do that with a term like "string" though
[01:10:24] <seutje> misterm: dictionary disagrees
[01:10:37] <misterm> chjj: I'm not sure what you're trying to say with that
[01:10:51] <chjj> tell me what the dictionary definition of string is
[01:10:53] <gnarf> ?ud anonymous
[01:10:58] <bot-t> gnarf, Anonymous - We are Anonymous, and we do not forgive. Forgiveness requires humility, humility requires dignity. We have neither. We are void of human restraints, such as self respect and common sense. All those who break this pact will be eliminated without hesitation. And by elimination we will put their name on an icky photo and shit in each others' mouths. Those who perform reckless actions or wish to harm the Anonymous will be eli...
[01:10:59] <chjj> and then compare it to what the term in computer science means
[01:11:01] <gnarf> :)
[01:11:09] <misterm> chjj: you're making a nonsensical point
[01:11:35] <chjj> go on
[01:11:36] <gnarf> ?ud string
[01:11:39] <bot-t> gnarf, string - to hang someone.
[01:11:41] <misterm> chjj: the usage of string in common usage, such as twine is not directly related to the comp sci term "string"
[01:11:50] <misterm> chjj: the term as used "string along" is
[01:11:56] <misterm> chjj: but that's completely besides the point
[01:12:15] <misterm> chjj: the fact of the matter, the usage of "anonymous" as used in comp sci is directly related to the common usage
[01:12:42] <misterm> chjj: if you go an look up "anonymous functions" in most comp sci books, it will say something like "a function that's not bound to an identifier"
[01:12:47] <chjj> youre assuming the thing youre trying to prove there, this whole argument is about whether anonymous is directly related to the coloquial usage or not
[01:12:58] <misterm> chjj: which is basically equivilant with the coloquial usage
[01:13:00] <chjj> simply saying, "well, it is" is circular reasoning
[01:13:07] <chjj> and then propping that up as an argument
[01:13:15] <gnarf> and you both are arguing this point cuz I don't like the term
[01:13:30] <misterm> chjj: no it's not at all
[01:13:44] <chjj> well if thats the way you learn to program, by not understanding something and then looking it up in the dictionary, good luck at being a developer
[01:13:58] <misterm> chjj: it's demonstrable what the coloquial usage is, it's demonstrable what the meaning in comp sci is
[01:14:00] <chjj> but according to you, it should work well
[01:14:06] <misterm> chjj: and the fact is they are one in the same
[01:14:15] <misterm> chjj: now you're just making more nonsensical arguments
[01:14:42] * gnarf hands each player boxing gloves
[01:14:42] <misterm> chjj: if you need an authority on what a word means, of course you go look it up...it has nothing to do with skill as a developer
[01:15:03] <blackspotwiggins> misterm, go look up "master boot record" in dictionary
[01:15:14] <misterm> chjj: I would say good luck to you if instead of looking up something to make sure it is correct, you just decide to make nonsense up
[01:15:18] <chjj> the meaning of words change based on usage, dictionaries arent an authority, they abide by *our* usage
[01:15:19] <blackspotwiggins> footprint of the overlord, that makes sense
[01:15:22] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: is there some point you're trying to make?
[01:15:27] <blackspotwiggins> in computers
[01:15:36] <chjj> and the term may mean something different with regards to computer programming
[01:15:43] <blackspotwiggins> yes - trying to apply regular meanings of words to a field does not work
[01:15:44] <chjj> as do a lot of words
[01:15:45] <misterm> chjj: there is certainly a treadmill, but that has nothing to do with our discussion
[01:15:53] <blackspotwiggins> a field like computers/programming
[01:15:57] <chjj> so like i said, using the dictionary as a reference for computer programming terms is unreliable
[01:16:00] * gnarf laughs
[01:16:16] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: your point in nonsense
[01:16:29] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: you're making a false analogy
[01:16:51] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: the proper analogy would be to look up the word "master", "boot", and "record" in the dictionary
[01:17:06] <blackspotwiggins> hence the footprint of overlord
[01:17:12] <chjj> but apparently string doesnt count
[01:17:13] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: and if you do that, you'll find what you get is very much the meaning of the phrase "MBR"
[01:17:23] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: furthermore, you're confusing the point
[01:18:22] <doritey> Man, why is there so much bickering on freenode.
[01:18:31] <doritey> Is it so hard for tech people to get along.
[01:18:31] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: we're not talking about applying purely a common-usage dictionary to comp sci, the point is the word "anonymous" as used in common usage and as in the phrase "anonymous function" are directly related, just as the word "master" in MBR has essentially the same meaning in common usage as in MBR
[01:18:42] <chjj> the word "anonymous" could mean anything in the term "anonymous function", the dictionary is not a reliable reference, it may coincide with the basic idea, but as weve seen with numerous terms in computer science, they dont mean nearly the same thing as the colloquial usage
[01:18:51] <doritey> This is why technocracy would never work. ;-)
[01:18:52] <chjj> i dont see why you insist on using the dictionary as a reference
[01:18:59] <misterm> chjj: it can't mean "anything" it has a very specific meaning
[01:19:18] <seutje> smurf means anything
[01:19:24] <seutje> why not anonymous?
[01:19:33] <misterm> chjj: I'm not insisting on using a dictionary, go look it up in a comp sci textbook
[01:19:42] <chjj> i would be fine with that!
[01:20:10] <chjj> dont quote the dictionary in here though and think youre proving someone right, even if youre right, youre still right for the wrong reasons
[01:20:24] <misterm> chjj: no, I'm right for the right reasons
[01:20:32] <chjj> oh i see what you did there
[01:20:33] <misterm> chjj: serious question, is english your first language?
[01:20:39] <chjj> yes
[01:20:41] * fireh smurf means salt ;)
[01:20:47] <seutje> I wonder how many lifetimes have been lost chasing worthless "facts" like these
[01:20:51] <misterm> chjj: certain words have very specificc meanings
[01:20:56] <misterm> chjj: anonymous is one of them
[01:21:15] <misterm> chjj: anonymous has one fairly specific meaning, and it's right there in the word..."without name"
[01:21:34] <misterm> chjj: the concept of an anonymous function is *directly* related to that
[01:22:03] <misterm> chjj: so understanding the "dictionary definition" of the word "anonymous" is directly related to understanding the concept in computer science
[01:22:06] <chjj> right, but you only know that *after* you read up on the concept of an anonymous function in terms of programming
[01:22:22] <gnarf> an anonymous function is a function expression without a name in its defining scope
[01:22:37] <sacho> yes, you're right, you should use a reference on terms used in the specific language context, not an english language dictionary
[01:22:37] <chjj> we know what an anonymous function is, were arguing over semantics
[01:22:44] <misterm> chjj: I'm not sure what you're trying to say
[01:22:50] <doritey> I love meta discussions.
[01:22:54] <gnarf> usually bound to a variable in a different function, usually having a purpose
[01:23:03] <misterm> chjj: what the term "anonymous function" means should be fairly self evident
[01:23:10] <doritey> "You don't understand my argument that proves my argument about you not understanding my argument."
[01:23:12] <chjj> youre assuming the very thing youre arguing in favor of, and using it as an argument
[01:23:14] <doritey> :-)
[01:23:18] <sacho> it's only "self evident" if you actually know what an anonymous function is.
[01:23:29] <chjj> exactly
[01:23:29] <gnarf> you are all trolling a random statement by me anyway :)
[01:23:43] <misterm> sacho: no, it's self evident if you understand the component parts
[01:23:49] <misterm> sacho: that's the whole point
[01:24:01] <chjj> if you have no concept of the word "anonymous" or "anonymous function" and you want to know what an anonymous function is, where do you turn? the dictionary?
[01:24:08] <misterm> sacho: the meaning of the phrase "anonymous function" is the concepts of "anonymous" and "function"
[01:24:21] <misterm> chjj: naturally
[01:24:26] <gnarf> thats just by luck though
[01:24:30] <misterm> chjj: some sort of reference text
[01:24:36] <sacho> misterm: and the meaning of the term regular expression is "an expression used regularly"
[01:24:38] <misterm> gnarf: that's not by luck, that's by design
[01:24:39] <sacho> please don't bullshit
[01:24:48] <gnarf> wtf does "closure" mean?
[01:24:50] <misterm> sacho: you're making a false analogy
[01:24:54] <sacho> something that closes, duh.
[01:24:58] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, it means we have a talk.
[01:25:01] <sacho> for example, return is a closure.
[01:25:08] <misterm> sacho: regular expressions *are* regular
[01:25:13] <chjj> well thats all i need to know, i looked up closure in the dictionary, give me a degree
[01:25:16] <misterm> but you guys are confusing the issue
[01:25:25] <misterm> you're bringing up things that have nothing to do with anything
[01:25:28] <gnarf> regular expressions parse regular language using an expression
[01:25:30] <sacho> misterm: the "regularity" in regular expressions is a mathematical term not at all related to the standard english usage
[01:25:41] <misterm> sacho: sure, but that has nothing to do with anything
[01:25:45] <sacho> yes it does
[01:25:51] <misterm> sacho: absolutelt not
[01:25:56] <sacho> the "anonymity" of a function could mean something completely different.
[01:26:13] <misterm> sacho: no it couldn't, because unlike "regular" anonymous only has one meaning
[01:26:18] <chjj> the dictionary is an unreliable source if you want to understand programming terminology, i cant believe you disagree with that
[01:26:19] <sacho> and how would you know that?
[01:26:21] <misterm> sacho: that's the whole point of this discussion!
[01:26:28] <doritey> Saying "look it up in a dictionary" in reference to a programming function is incorrect, period. This is regardless of whether the dictionary entry corresponds with the meaning of the function.
[01:26:33] <doritey> There. :-)
[01:26:57] <fotoflo> strange.  my function is working as it should (following in debugger) until I'm done with the meat of the function, then it takes me deep into jquery.js for something or other
[01:26:58] <misterm> doritey: that's complete nonsense
[01:27:00] <blackspotwiggins> no, please look up stuff in the dictionary. that means people who actually know what regular expressions are have less competition
[01:27:13] <fotoflo> and then something gets messed up
[01:27:27] <chjj> exactly, even if the defintion happens to coincide with the computer programming definition, you may be right about the definition, yes. buts it for the wrong reasons
[01:27:32] <doritey> misterm: It's not, because the dictionary entry is in reference to something, and that usually doesn't encompass programming.
[01:27:43] <seutje> I like it when the word "period" is boxed in inbetween a comma and an actual period, it instantly makes whatever precedes it fact
[01:27:45] <doritey> If you look up the word "tree" you're not going to see it in a programming context unless it's wikipedia.
[01:27:57] <misterm> you guys are not understanding what is being said
[01:28:06] <doritey> No, you're just trying to save face. Give up so we can move on.
[01:28:10] <misterm> chjj: you've completely missed the point, as well as many others
[01:28:12] <seutje> u should rant about it for another hour
[01:28:13] <doritey> Nobody cares if you're wrong.
[01:28:15] <seutje> it'll help, u'll see
[01:28:17] <sacho> Ok, an anonymous function is "a function without a name". Best hope that both anonymous is used in the dictionary sense. Then best hope "name" is being used in the dictionary sense - you need to know what a "name" is in the programming language
[01:28:21] <doritey> Everybody's wrong at some point. :-)
[01:28:25] <misterm> no, I'm trying to educate you guys
[01:28:29] <chjj> misterm: i suppose so, in that case ill assume you agree with my position
[01:28:38] <sacho> Especially if you're not proficient in it, it's all your own guesswork
[01:28:41] <gnarf> misterm: we don't need your dictionary education
[01:28:43] <chjj> trying to educate us?
[01:28:43] <seutje> what about this "a" I keep seeing?
[01:28:49] <chjj> very humble arent we?
[01:28:49] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure we all know how to read
[01:28:50] <blackspotwiggins> so the point is look stuff up in dictionary?
[01:28:51] <sacho> fotoflo: specifics?
[01:28:53] <misterm> yhr poiny is, uou guys are arguing against a point I never made
[01:29:13] <misterm> Let's review, since you guys seem to have comprehension problems
[01:29:19] <fotoflo> sacho: http://pastie.org/2379474
[01:29:22] <sacho> misterm: Ok, then your answer is simply insufficient.
[01:29:22] <gnarf> except coldhead, sometimes i wonder if he can read ;)
[01:29:25] <misterm> There was discussion about anonymous functions
[01:29:29] <seutje> calm down :(
[01:29:31] <chjj> well, for future reference, if i think i need to be educated by someone in #jquery, ill ask first
[01:29:32] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead++
[01:29:36] <chjj> no offense to #jquery
[01:29:37] <seutje> u can't even spell anymore :(
[01:30:02] <misterm> I pointed out that since the word "anonymous" only has one meaning...that of common usage, there should be little confusion.
[01:30:16] <seutje> holy shit, here he goes again
[01:30:20] <misterm> Discussion about other words that happen to have various meanings have no bearing on anything.
[01:30:43] <chjj> i dont like spinning wheels
[01:30:45] <chjj> sorry
[01:30:59] <sacho> I wasn't aware anonymous meant <gnarf> an anonymous function is a function expression without a name in its defining scope
[01:31:04] <misterm> The fact of the matter is, many comp sci terms are directly based on other concepts, so checking the dictionary can be informative, though obviously not always.
[01:31:15] <misterm> sacho: that's not a good definition
[01:31:18] <chjj> i think ill call an anonymous function a gnarf from now on, in honor of this night
[01:31:20] <gnarf> its horrible
[01:31:25] <gnarf> that definition
[01:31:32] <gnarf> but its pretty accurate too
[01:31:33] <sacho> neither is "a function with no name"
[01:31:45] <sacho> or perhaps
[01:31:49] <fotoflo> sacho: any ideas?
[01:31:49] <misterm> sacho: actually, that's a very good definition because it's what the term means
[01:31:51] <sacho> "a function whose name is unknown"
[01:31:54] <gnarf> a function with no name is not neccesarily anonymous, it could be bound to a variable
[01:32:02] <sacho> or "a function whose name is unknown currently"
[01:32:05] <misterm> sacho: I would say, it needs to be more specific
[01:32:05] <blackspotwiggins> i just increased my life quality by increasing the length of my ignore list
[01:32:08] <sacho> or perhaps "a function hiding its name"
[01:32:10] <gnarf> var abc = function () {}
[01:32:15] <seutje> I call all my anonymous functions "Sparky", so fuck y'all!
[01:32:19] <gnarf> ^^^ not anonymous imo
[01:32:21] <JKarsrud> blackspotwiggins: <3
[01:32:21] <misterm> sacho: since "name" is ambiguous
[01:32:23] <sacho> misterm: see, so your answer was incomplete
[01:32:34] <sacho> uh huh, you should look in the dictionary for "name"
[01:32:35] <sacho> :)
[01:32:39] <misterm> sacho: not at all
[01:32:41] <sacho> fotoflo: where do you get the problem?
[01:32:42] <chjj> technically that function has no name, but it is tied to a variable, yeah, the problem is a "function name" means something specific in js
[01:32:49] <chjj> OH MAN
[01:32:55] <chjj> NAME MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN JS
[01:33:00] <misterm> sacho: as I said, "a function with no name" is a fairly good start, I never saud it was the end, and it fact I calrified
[01:33:05] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: did I make the cut?
[01:33:06] <chjj> THAT MEANS THE DICTIONARY HAS A DIFFERENT DEFINITION
[01:33:08] <gnarf> chjj: do you agree "var abc = function() {}" is that function "anonymous"
[01:33:09] <chjj> MINDFUCK
[01:33:11] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, nah
[01:33:11] <sacho> calm down
[01:33:14] <blackspotwiggins> you're cool
[01:33:20] <misterm> I don't get why you guys can't just admit I came in and told you guys what an anonymous function is
[01:33:27] <seutje> sweet, we got into the full caps level of worthless discussions
[01:33:34] <seutje> shit just got to barrens level!
[01:33:41] * gnarf laughs
[01:33:43] <blackspotwiggins> cruise control for cool, etc.
[01:33:45] <JKarsrud> haha
[01:33:49] <chjj> gnarf: i dont think that function is anonymous, it is tied to a variable name if nothing else, or at the very least defined with a variable name
[01:34:00] <chjj> even if it doesnt have a name
[01:34:06] <seutje> now he didn't even capitalize the I, how do u expect me to read this? :(
[01:34:09] <gnarf> chjj: yeah, thats why i don't like the term
[01:34:19] <doritey> misterm: The thing is that dictionary entries are always in reference to something, and it usually doesn't include programming constructs. If you tell someone to look up what an "anonymous fucntion" means in a dictionary, then you're referring to something that doesn't exist. If you were to tell someone to look up what "anonymous" means then you would be correct, however. I think this is what
[01:34:19] <doritey> most people are trying to tell you.
[01:34:26] <doritey> It's not even a big deal and I don't udnerstan why we're fighting about it
[01:34:27] <fotoflo> sacho: first the user clicks on #twitterTopic and enters some text and then clicks #changeTwitterTopic…..Everything runs just fine in changeTwitterTopic(), until the last }
[01:34:30] <gnarf> chjj: because most people assume that is an anonymous function because it has no name
[01:34:35] <doritey> I think initialyl people had a problem with you being sort of rude by telling them to look it up
[01:34:38] <misterm> doritey: yea, but there's no point in telling me that because I never made that point
[01:34:40] <doritey> so they turned on you
[01:34:52] <gnarf> when in actuality, its just a function expression bound to "abc" - not anonymous
[01:34:56] <doritey> that's what happens when you don't show people respect. :-)
[01:34:58] <chjj> gnarf: thats not the fault of the term "anonymous function", its the fault of the people misusing the term
[01:35:11] <chjj> which is why this all started i guess, you said you didnt like the term
[01:35:14] <gnarf> chjj: yup
[01:35:17] <misterm> gnarf: actually for the purposes of JS it would probably be better to consider it anonymous
[01:35:24] <SergSergiu> can tell me how to replace in this example : "<a href="#" onClick="alert('Hello!');">Say Hi</a>" with  $('#ex1').click(function(){
[01:35:27] <misterm> gnarf: since that's how it will show up in stack traces
[01:35:30] <SergSergiu> i want to action #ex1 on nclick
[01:35:32] <SergSergiu> ?
[01:35:32] <chjj> i have no problem with it, if someone misuses a term, it doesnt mean the term itself is faulty
[01:35:46] <sacho> SergSergiu: give <a> that id
[01:36:03] <SergSergiu> ;( sacho no id
[01:36:14] <sacho> fotoflo: I'm not sure, where do you bind the event?
[01:36:14] <gnarf> chjj: makes sense, i mean, i like the idea of anonymous functions, but most of the time its better practice to avoid them
[01:36:17] <SergSergiu> i know this is solution..in my example no running :) can help me with my example?
[01:36:25] <sacho> SergSergiu: then you can select a, and hope it's the only one.
[01:36:45] <sacho> $('a')...
[01:36:56] <fotoflo> SergSergiu: <a href="#" id = "a">  $("#").click(function(){alert("say hi")});
[01:37:00] <misterm> SergSergiu: give the link an id, or select based on it's position in the DOM
[01:37:06] <chjj> chjj: i dont think this conversation was ever about the usage of anonymous functions, hehe
[01:37:13] <chjj> or the merit of using them
[01:37:13] <gnarf> misterm: and - thats the reason I don't like that term --- "anonymous function" === "function expression with no name" is not a definition i want
[01:37:13] <SergSergiu> :( ohhhhhhhh
[01:37:17] <chjj> it was all semantics
[01:37:20] <fotoflo> sacho: acceptTwitterTopic event?
[01:37:21] <sacho> fotoflo: facepalm
[01:37:23] <sacho> sorry
[01:37:26] <SergSergiu> i dont need ALERT is just example i want to action ex1 :)
[01:37:31] <SergSergiu> not running with id="ex1"
[01:37:40] <SergSergiu> i try if is possible to action it with onclick
[01:37:47] <misterm> gnarf: why's that?
[01:38:09] <misterm> gnarf: don't get  me wrong, I see where you're going, but I'd appreciate if you could elaborate
[01:38:17] <fotoflo> SergSergiu: sorry, typo   :      <a href="#" id = "a">  $("#a").click(function(){alert("say hi")});
[01:38:21] <fotoflo> SergSergiu: does that work for you?
[01:38:28] <fotoflo> sacho:  whats the facepalm?
[01:38:29] <fotoflo> ?
[01:38:34] <gnarf> misterm: because its never really anonymous, as soon as its created its bound to a variable
[01:38:55] <gnarf> an actual anonymous function like .click( function() {} )
[01:39:04] <chjj> yeah, gnarf is right, its not technically anonymous
[01:39:18] <sacho> fotoflo: I didnt notice that :)
[01:39:20] <sacho> one sec
[01:39:20] <gnarf> that click example is an "anonymous function"
[01:39:31] <chjj> but, anonymous functions used as callbacks are much easier to refer to as callbacks
[01:39:32] <gnarf> var abc = function() {} isn't anonymous, its called "abc"
[01:39:33] <misterm> gnarf: I see that distinction and can appreciate it
[01:39:46] <gnarf> chjj: exactly, "handler" "callback" etc
[01:39:52] <gnarf> usually a better name for it
[01:39:53] <misterm> gnarf: but can you also appreciate the distinction with how that will show up as anonymous in a stack trace, etc?
[01:40:04] <SergSergiu> :(
[01:40:09] <misterm> gnarf: what if you create a reference to it, does it have two names?
[01:40:16] <chjj> but then again, i callback can be a callback, and not anonymous :)
[01:40:19] <chjj> ooh tricky
[01:40:24] <gnarf> misterm: no, i can't because the stack trace is wrong imo
[01:40:29] <SergSergiu> i write this 10x time :)) id="THE ID" not ruuning on my example
[01:40:30] <fotoflo> sacho: so any thoughts on why its not working?
[01:40:31] <gnarf> chjj: true ;)
[01:40:37] <SergSergiu> is possible to action "theid" with onclick?
[01:40:42] <fotoflo> or rather, working wierdly
[01:40:50] <misterm> gnarf: what about references that point to different functions at different times?
[01:41:11] <gnarf> misterm: what about "closure"
[01:41:19] <misterm> gnarf: sure, I respect that's your opinion, but you see that as reality is now, the distinction exists right?
[01:42:11] <chjj> non of this stuff is mutually inclusive, a callback doesnt have to be anonymous, neither does a closure, and neither does one have to be a callback
[01:42:40] <chjj> why are we bringing up closures now?
[01:42:50] <gnarf> chjj: cuz he dodged that tangental argument
[01:42:51] <misterm> gnarf: I definitely agree it's an oddity in the JS language, but I'm just pointing out the issue
[01:42:58] <misterm> gnarf: what about closures?
[01:43:29] <fotoflo> sacho: it appears that acceptTwitterTopicInput is getting called after chageTwitterTopic is finished running
[01:43:35] <SergSergiu> good :) all tell me action with id="example" , and i write at start "NOT RUNNING with id="abc" :) .. and all tell me again wath i know
[01:43:52] <SergSergiu> wel..i can action id="abc" in other way?
[01:43:55] <blackspotwiggins> SergSergiu, maybe you should try to make it more clear
[01:43:58] <chjj> i love how in the background of all this noise, Sergiu is talking about real stuff
[01:44:09] <blackspotwiggins> like what do you mean by "action" ?
[01:44:19] <misterm> gnarf: I don't understand how it relates to what we were talking about
[01:44:21] <SergSergiu> i have one dialog
[01:44:22] <SergSergiu> $("#a").click(function(){alert("say hi")});
[01:44:24] <SergSergiu> oups
[01:44:26] <SergSergiu> http://pastering.com/11
[01:44:29] <SergSergiu> ex1 and ex2
[01:44:30] <gnarf> misterm: what we are talking about is my dislike of a term
[01:44:42] <gnarf> i don't need to have a reason, it just sits wrong, because its misused
[01:44:43] <SergSergiu> and i want to action dialog on menu items
[01:44:52] <misterm> chjj: lol, I don't know if I'd consider it more "real"
[01:44:54] <SergSergiu> and with id="ex1" just not running.
[01:44:55] <chjj> you dislike "closure" too? im just confused why closures got brought up
[01:45:02] <misterm> gnarf: you mean your dislike of the term "closure" as well?
[01:45:11] <misterm> gnarf: I'd agree it's a term people misuse
[01:45:12] <chjj> misterm: more on topic at the very least
[01:45:39] <misterm> chjj: sure, I'd agree with that, though I'd say this is all stuff that's important for JS developers to understand
[01:45:43] <gnarf> chjj: because earlier when misterm was trying to define things in dictionaries, closure was still a sticking point, and i figured that him asking me to redundantly clarify my earlier statements required a nice tangental leap
[01:45:47] <SergSergiu> i tryed to add onclick alert...and this running on menu ... and I thought if i try some similar .. maybe running :)
[01:46:06] <chjj> i see
[01:46:10] <misterm> gnarf: it's not though, that doesn't make any sense
[01:46:23] <gnarf> yes, i understand that in JS most people define an "anonymous function" as a function expression without a "name"
[01:46:24] <sacho> fotoflo: is the changeTwitterTopic a descendant of twitterTopic?
[01:46:27] <chjj> nonono
[01:46:30] <chjj> its fine
[01:46:36] <chjj> we dont need this again
[01:46:38] <blackspotwiggins> SergSergiu, i dont understand anything you are saying
[01:46:53] <misterm> gnarf: I never said every term in comp sci is directly related to and exactly the same as other meanings....only the phrase "anonymous funcction", as well as some others...also they are often related in some way, "closure" is an example
[01:47:03] <chjj> lol
[01:47:03] <fotoflo> sacho: yes
[01:47:14] <sacho> fotoflo: if so I'd guess after you add the click to change, you now have an event on topic and on change, and when you click change, both are called before you manage to unbind the event
[01:47:23] <chjj> its like watching something start on fire and you cant stop it
[01:47:59] <gnarf> chjj: sorry, i keep lighting it back up
[01:48:03] <misterm> chjj: honestly I think discussions like this are a nice change from the typical "how do I send email with jQuery" questions I often see in here
[01:48:06] <SergSergiu> black ;| , i have dialog js , http://pastering.com/11 , ex1 ex2 , on my menu i cant action it with id="ex1" , but otherwise go, not only in menu
[01:48:10] <SergSergiu> now understand? :)
[01:48:36] <fotoflo> sacho: but i unbound when accept is fired
[01:48:38] <misterm> chjj: not that I in any way disparage new people, we all have to start somewhere, and I don't mind helping....but it's nice to have something else to talk about
[01:48:49] <chjj> misterm: well i hope the only two possible categories here arent "semantics or basic jquery questions"
[01:48:58] <chjj> i hope its more than that
[01:49:21] <gnarf> im not saying i haven't used the term anonymous function myself in the past
[01:49:23] <misterm> chjj: sure
[01:49:25] <chjj> i dont even use jquery, i dont know why i am in here
[01:49:25] <gnarf> either
[01:49:38] <gnarf> chjj: cuz its the bestest support channel in irc
[01:50:09] <gnarf> people even convince us to help with php a lot
[01:50:20] <chjj> i dont use php either ;p
[01:50:34] * Jakey slaps chjj
[01:50:38] <Jakey> what do you juse
[01:50:40] <misterm> ha, you shouldn't encourage them gnarf
[01:50:53] <chjj> i do answer questions in here sometimes though, just because i dont use php or jquery doesnt mean i do not know them
[01:50:53] <fotoflo> sacho: if i remove 	$("#twitterTopic").click(acceptTwitterTopicInput);  the change function, i don't get the problem,
[01:50:55] <gnarf> chjj: good for you! I'm waning myself off of it ;)
[01:51:12] <gnarf> i've had a hate/hate relationship with php for way too many years
[01:51:13] <Jakey> what
[01:51:20] <chjj> Jakey: serverside or client side?
[01:51:25] <fotoflo> sacho:  but then it's not clickable after being reset
[01:51:27] <Jakey> server
[01:51:29] <Jakey> chjj
[01:51:33] <Jakey> gnarf why?
[01:51:40] <chjj> Jakey: serverside i use node.js, clientside ive been developing my own dom library and app framework
[01:51:41] <Jakey> asp.net mvc is better?
[01:52:05] <Jakey> riight
[01:52:12] <gnarf> Jakey: neither is a language i want to be developing in in 2 more years
[01:52:22] <sacho> fotoflo: I'm not sure how the timing works there, just guesswork - apparently unbinding the event when it's already being triggered won't stop it from firing
[01:52:25] <chjj> ?
[01:52:36] <Jakey> chjj: so only JS
[01:52:41] <Jakey> thats .....
[01:52:42] <chjj> absolutely
[01:52:44] <gnarf> unbinding events, in general, is bad practice
[01:52:46] <chjj> :)
[01:52:51] <gnarf> chjj: do you use express?
[01:53:04] <chjj> yeah, for some things
[01:53:12] <Jakey> gnarf so what willl you be using if not php? for serverside?
[01:53:14] <chjj> i like express
[01:53:19] <sacho> fotoflo: Why not use a flag instead of binding and unbinding the events?
[01:53:19] <gnarf> Jakey: likely node
[01:53:23] <gnarf> Jakey: if not, ruby
[01:53:26] <seutje> whoa, we got over the anonymous shizzle? :o
[01:53:26] <fotoflo> whats a flag?
[01:53:36] <Jakey> dam
[01:53:42] <chjj> its well-written and im glad its the most popular node framework, node is lucky we dont have some big bloated framework like other platforms
[01:53:43] <Jakey> whats it with this ruby
[01:53:45] <sacho> a variable that you'll be checking in your events whether or not they should "do stuff"
[01:54:17] <fotoflo> oh, a global
[01:54:20] <fotoflo> ?
[01:54:37] <sacho> or something, sure
[01:54:58] <fotoflo> so you would recommend putting one event and then checking state for all of these
[01:54:59] <fotoflo> ?
[01:55:15] <sacho> one sec.
[01:55:44] <SergSergiu> Two days continuously ask the same thing ,and all people tell me use id=abc , and i tell from start that not running on me menu.. id=abc ... anyway support sux for jquery
[01:55:58] <SergSergiu> on my*
[01:55:58] * Jakey slaps SergSergiu
[01:56:01] <blackspotwiggins> SergSergiu, sure.
[01:56:02] <Jakey> where are you from :)
[01:56:08] <gnarf> SergSergiu: you're not asking the right question
[01:56:13] <SergSergiu> from italy
[01:56:32] <Jakey> okay. maybe thats why
[01:57:03] <johnline3> hey guys, im looking to make a fade in on page load for about 18 elements
[01:57:14] <Jakey> SergSergiu, maybe ask more clearly :)
[01:57:25] <chjj> anyone want to read my poem about coffeescript?
[01:57:29] <chjj> https://gist.github.com/1148119
[01:58:00] <SergSergiu> how i can write more clearly? :) i cant action my Dialog Jq , with id="abc" , and i need another way to action ..is clear
[01:58:01] <SergSergiu> no?
[01:58:39] <Jakey> SergSergiu lol, thats hard to understand
[01:58:43] <Jakey> SergSergiu Link?
[01:58:53] <SergSergiu> or some help to replace function from menu.js http://pastering.com/11 to action my Dialog Jquery
[01:58:58] <misterm> chjj: is it written in CS?
[01:59:12] <chjj> misterm: no, its written in english
[01:59:38] <misterm> chjj: :( it'd be cooler if it was written in CS
[01:59:53] <chjj> i think i would have to take a shower afterward if i wrote it in cs
[01:59:59] <chjj> would feel too dirty
[02:00:05] <misterm> chjj: why's that?
[02:00:19] <chjj> what do you mean? i thought i just explained that
[02:00:25] <chjj> because i would be using coffeescript
[02:00:44] <chjj> ugly terrible language that allows people to avoid learning js in favor of compiling to a high level language
[02:00:48] <misterm> chjj: lol, sure I gather that...but why would that make you feel dirty?
[02:00:52] <chjj> because theyre afraid of prototypes
[02:01:09] <chjj> i just said
[02:01:11] <misterm> chjj: lol, do you see the irony of saying that in a jQuery channel ;-p
[02:01:14] <chjj> ... :(
[02:01:18] <misterm> chjj: sure, channel lag
[02:01:20] <chjj> kind of
[02:01:31] <misterm> chjj: anyway, I would note: 1) if you try to use CS without knowing JS you'll be in trouble
[02:01:37] <SergSergiu> Jackey , http://178.32.137.37/tools/ here is complete example, jq dialog running with id=123, just on menu not running :(
[02:01:41] <misterm> 2) CS uses prototypal inheritence
[02:01:46] <chjj> well originally i mentioned this in the node channel, i thought someone in here might enjoy it though
[02:01:46] <coppa> helly people I know, new version of Magic jquery ! http://jquery-css.com/magic-jquery , now can align/limit element with any relative+offset values
[02:01:55] <misterm> It just adds a shortcut for the most common pattern
[02:02:01] <coppa> well, if you have any feedback don't hesitate etc etc
[02:02:17] <chjj> but i have more respect for anyone in here that uses JS over CS, that someone who uses CS exclusively
[02:02:25] <chjj> than*
[02:02:29] <misterm> I can totally dig if people don't like the syntax of CS, it's clearly a subjective/taste thing
[02:02:43] <chjj> well thats not all i dont like about it
[02:02:52] <misterm> but it annoys me when people try to paint CS as if it's for people who don't know JS, or somehow "hides" things
[02:03:07] <chjj> it makes code less portable, it divides the JS corner of the world, and its kind of a sin to be compiling to a high level language
[02:03:21] <chjj> furthermore, people use it to avoid learning JS
[02:03:26] <chjj> but the thing that most bugs me...
[02:03:45] <chjj> is the users themselves, who say something like, "oh my, js is so bearable when using coffeescript"
[02:03:52] <chjj> insulting js at the same time
[02:04:06] <chjj> i always want to reply, "wow, that was close, you almost had to learn a language"
[02:04:35] <misterm> chjj: how does it make code less portable?
[02:04:35] <chjj> so the percentage of its users that are smug like that really bug me
[02:04:47] <misterm> chjj: yea, but aren't you committing the same sin?
[02:04:48] <chjj> because you have to compile it
[02:04:50] <chjj> ...
[02:04:59] <misterm> chjj: sure, but how does that affect portability?
[02:04:59] <chjj> how so?
[02:05:06] <misterm> chjj: because you're being smug in kind
[02:05:24] <misterm> chjj: you can't honestly say that all CS users are smug, I'll agree some of them are complete jackasses
[02:05:31] <chjj> its a very niche community, if you write an app, and you want to reuse some code on another project youre working on, you have something in two different languages
[02:05:37] <misterm> chjj: but so are some people who use jQuery, or Ruby, or whatever
[02:05:51] <misterm> chjj: sure, but code written in CS can be run anywhere, it's just JS
[02:05:52] <chjj> sorry, on another project in js, something you might be working on with someone else
[02:06:01] <johnline3> i want to fade in 18 images that are a child of a div, can anyone point me to a code that will stagger the fadein on these children. eg, img1 fades in at 200ms, img3 fades in at 400ms..
[02:06:03] <misterm> chjj: in terms of compiling that can be done anywhere as well
[02:06:15] <RealSolid> what does $blah point to here? $blah = $(".blah")[1];
[02:06:24] <misterm> chjj: but to me, the portability argument only makes sense when you're talking about 3rd parties using your code, in wich case CS is the same as JS
[02:06:24] <RealSolid> the second element?
[02:06:28] <chjj> misterm: i never said all CS users are smug, read what i said, i very clearly stated, "the percentage of the CS users that say this"
[02:06:44] <sacho> fotoflo: http://jsfiddle.net/sCP7H/
[02:06:50] <misterm> chjj: sure, I didn't mean to imply that you did...I was just saying the fact that some of them are smug is neither here nor there
[02:07:00] <chjj> fine, if its portable to you, use it, many do, im never touching that garbage though
[02:07:02] <sacho> or you could use a global for the flag
[02:07:09] <blackspotwiggins> johnline3, nest the next fade into callback
[02:07:11] <misterm> chjj: I could say a lot of jQuery users are smug, that's not really a good argument for or against jQuery imo
[02:07:18] <chjj> im not trying to convince you to agree with me, im just stating what i feel
[02:07:20] <johnline3> im a nub
[02:07:30] <chjj> im not even trying to argue against it, im simply stating, its terrible
[02:07:35] <misterm> chjj: the same, I'm just curious
[02:07:41] <chjj> i dont care to defend my position there
[02:07:43] <sacho> fotoflo: you just need one way to find out "should I be working right now" (for the change and the input), and event.stopPropagation() to stop both events from firing when you just click change
[02:07:52] <chjj> its not worth it to demonstrate that a terrible language is terrible
[02:07:58] <sacho> fotoflo: you could even use your method with event.stopPropagation(). But it's a lot of binding and unbinding of events
[02:08:07] <sacho> bbl
[02:08:10] <misterm> chjj: ha, it just seems to me you arrived at the conclusion rather hastily and without a whole lot of objective reasons, which is fine
[02:08:15] <chjj> i originally didnt feel this way about CS, but i slowly grew to hate it more and more
[02:08:27] <chjj> oh no
[02:08:34] <chjj> i originally thought CS was kind of neat
[02:08:36] <misterm> chjj: it's fine to have opinion and tastes, as long as they are had as opinion and tastes instead of presented as facts
[02:08:40] <chjj> and i did learn it
[02:08:53] <johnline3> $('.fade1').children.delay(500).animate({opacity: '1'}, 1000, function() {$(this).children.css('filter', 'none');}); heres what i have so far, im guessing i need a table or an index to stagger the delays
[02:09:04] <chjj> well, i gave you my reasons, you can decide whether theyre objective or not, i dont care, like i said, im not here to convince your
[02:09:07] <chjj> you*
[02:09:12] <chjj> im just here to insult something i dislike
[02:09:47] <fotoflo> sacho: hmm, to do that I will have to do a bunch of refactoring...
[02:10:02] <fotoflo> thanks for taking the time to write that up btw
[02:10:11] <blackspotwiggins> johnline3, wtf
[02:10:12] <SergSergiu> oksushi, I'll buy a book to solve my problem, I am tired and bored
[02:10:22] <blackspotwiggins> you know there are fadein/fadeout ?
[02:10:26] <oksushi> ok, you go do that o_O
[02:10:30] <misterm> chjj: if you don't mind me asking, how much time did you spend with it? I find a lot of people, especially the people who are like "omg coffeescript is teh c00l" spend a little time with it and get the basic ideas, but don't really "know" it
[02:10:32] <chjj> one thing i would put to you objectively, is that prototypes are superior to classes in every way, and while cs doesnt prohibit the use of prototypes, it certainly encourages use of classes more
[02:10:47] <chjj> i would want any high level language i used to be prototypal
[02:10:47] <blackspotwiggins> oksushi, no wonder italy's economy is how it is :)
[02:10:57] <johnline3> lol oops, yeah i should change that blackspotwiggins
[02:11:06] <oksushi> :P
[02:11:18] <chjj> misterm: im still spending time with it, i learn it by converting cs to js by hand out of spite
[02:11:22] <chjj> learned*
[02:11:23] <misterm> chjj: well I would strongly disagree with that, CS uses prototypal inheritence through and through, it justs uses "class" as syntactic sugar for the most common shortcut
[02:11:23] <fotoflo> ill be back in a few minutes
[02:11:47] <Guest77055> <blackspotwiggins> stfu
[02:11:53] <chjj> misterm: i feel like youre not reading what i say, i stated very clearly that, yes, it does not prohibit prototypes
[02:12:07] <chjj> but how many cs users do you see opting for prototypes?
[02:12:25] <misterm> chjj: I feel maybe you're not understanding what I am saying
[02:12:31] <misterm> chjj: cs users don't have a choice
[02:12:38] <misterm> chjj: it's prototypes or nothing
[02:12:51] <misterm> chjj: the only choice is *how* you use them, which is the same choice you have in JS
[02:13:31] <misterm> chjj: I'll agree that if you don't happen to use/need the pattern that is default in CS it might now be a win/be an annoyance, but as you say theres nothing to stop you from doing it another way
[02:13:42] <chjj> yes, they are prototypes, i understand that, logically though, classes are merely a subset of prototypes, so you cant say CS classes are any less classical than anything else
[02:13:58] <chjj> CS class syntax i should say
[02:13:59] <misterm> chjj: I would strongly disagree with that
[02:14:24] <chjj> okay
[02:14:30] <misterm> chjj: I think we can both agree that what CS is doing is building a "class" abstraction on top of prototypes
[02:14:41] <chjj> yes
[02:14:50] <misterm> chjj: and that while this "class" abstraction is distinct and different from classes in other languages, it is similar
[02:15:05] <misterm> chjj: and it seems you object to abstracting that away
[02:15:17] <chjj> well
[02:15:29] <misterm> chjj: I would just say that the abstraction is very thin, and what you end up with is what most JS developers write anyway
[02:15:57] <chjj> personally, i dont like classes in high level languages, i would prefer prototypes for every high level language, thats my *personal* reason for disliking it
[02:16:22] <chjj> my maybe still personal reason for disliking it, is that it encourages lack of understanding of prototypes
[02:16:29] <misterm> chjj: sure, I'm just saying that really it is prototypes, and if you don't like the abstraction you can use prototypes seemlessly
[02:16:44] <chjj> otherwise, if prototypes were so easily used by these people, why would they feel the need to layer on class syntax?
[02:17:02] <misterm> chjj: I'd agree with you there, except I think anyone who tries to use CS without knowing JS very well is in for trouble
[02:17:14] <chjj> yes, exactly
[02:17:18] <misterm> chjj: and that anyone who encourages learning CS "instead" of JS is very very wrong
[02:17:22] <chjj> the problem is, many people do dothat
[02:17:32] <mazzachre> I know it is not a normal recruitment channel via IRC, but I was wondering if anyone would consider a small contract work for me?
[02:17:34] <misterm> chjj: but the reason for the abstraction is because it's a PITA, and why not make it easier
[02:17:57] <chjj> who says classes are easier?
[02:18:01] <sacho> fotoflo: without refactoring, you can just put event.stopPropagation in change
[02:18:04] <misterm> chjj: there's plenty of people who do, but there are a lot of people hyping coffeescript who don't know what they're talkinga bout
[02:18:07] <sacho> fotoflo: (or whichever the inner one is)
[02:18:14] <misterm> chjj: but that's true of *anything*
[02:18:39] <chjj> okay, maybe this is the root of my general attitude, why are classes considered easier?
[02:18:43] <misterm> chjj: I don't mean "classes are easier", but that classes as they exist in coffeescript, are a shortcut for a certain pattern
[02:19:07] <sacho> fotoflo: by the way you're missing a var before oldTopic - this way oldTopic is a global variable instead of local(and if that's not needed, it's better to avoid it)
[02:19:11] <chjj> i dont think so, i think theyre an alternative for people who refuse to learn prototypes
[02:19:15] <chjj> not a shortcut
[02:19:26] <misterm> chjj: that's simply not true
[02:19:37] <misterm> chjj: I agree totally that that *can* and *will* happen
[02:19:56] <misterm> chjj: but that's not what they're for, and that's not how they work neccesarily
[02:21:03] <chjj> alright
[02:21:33] <misterm> chjj: I would say CS is basically a forklift, it's a machine that augments your strength
[02:21:51] <chjj> js is already plenty abstracted
[02:21:57] <misterm> chjj: some people will be lazy and use the forklift to lift their groceries, and as a consequence suffer problems, but I'd say they're doing it wrong
[02:22:13] <misterm> chjj: maybe you don't need a forklift, or a different kind of forklift, I'd say that's fine
[02:22:27] <misterm> chjj: I would argue that it lacks some things
[02:22:40] <misterm> chjj: one thing is at the very least, CS standardizes them somewhat
[02:23:07] <misterm> chjj: there's a fair amount of things in CS that are actually just JS language features, but are not supported by all browsers
[02:23:26] <chjj> i didnt say it didnt lack things, only that its plenty abstracted, and that adding a layer on top of it that requires you to compile to js isnt the answer
[02:23:27] <misterm> do CS is a way to use them in a cross-browser way, of course there are other ways as well
[02:23:37] <chjj> theres a few things i would add to js to polish it a bit more
[02:23:56] <chjj> but not by way of CS, and i *certainly* wouldnt turn it into a sig whitespace language for no reason
[02:24:03] <misterm> chjj: well I would say that given the circumstances it's a fairly good one, JS is unique in some respects
[02:24:15] <misterm> chjj: sure, but that's largely a subjective thing
[02:24:41] <chjj> well like i said, my position is very subjective
[02:24:42] <misterm> chjj: some people like significant whitespace, some don't, there's benefits to each
[02:24:55] <misterm> chjj: sure, I'm not trying to argue that everyone should use CS
[02:25:01] <chjj> and some people like it because they like to be trendy and hate C syntax
[02:25:15] <misterm> I'm just saying that there are a lot of damn smart JS devs who use it because it provides a lot of useful features
[02:25:18] <chjj> sometimes i hate telling it how it is
[02:25:51] <misterm> sure, some people use jQuery because it's uber-cool...there will always be hipsters
[02:25:56] <misterm> and I agree they are annoying
[02:27:12] <chjj> well, all i can say is ill never use it, and ill probably keep criticizing it
[02:27:59] <misterm> chjj: sure, I can respect that...I just hope you'll criticize it based on actual facts and not generic problems that occur with every technology
[02:28:46] <misterm> there's a lot of reasons to not use/dislike CS
[02:28:57] <chjj> i told you my criticisms, most of them are facts, whether theyre good reasons, you can decide
[02:29:06] <chjj> people use CS to avoid learning JS - fact
[02:29:15] <chjj> people use it to be trendy - fact
[02:29:26] <misterm> chjj: those are either not facts, or not exclusive to CS
[02:29:27] <chjj> it divides the js world - fact
[02:29:33] <fruitbat> I'm using draggables and droppables. Does anyone know how to the ORIGINAL parent of the item has been dragged? If its a folder and no longer has children I need to change the class of the original source
[02:29:42] <Jayflux> anyone know why my setTimeouts don't work? http://jsfiddle.net/FwnQG/
[02:29:48] <misterm> chjj: those things are all true of *jQuery* as well as every single library out there
[02:30:04] <yogurt_truck> those are facts if you prepend "some "
[02:30:06] <misterm> chjj: do you believe people shouldn't use jQuery? or Dojo? or YUI?
[02:30:17] <chjj> what does it matter if theyre exclusive to JS, hitler killed jews, "yeah, but that wasnt *exclusive* to hitler"
[02:30:25] <chjj> so what? it was still wrong
[02:30:49] <yogurt_truck> chjj: that analogy makes zero sense
[02:30:49] <misterm> chjj: it matters because unless those things are *exclusive* to CS, or they are the *only* reason, then it's meaningless to say
[02:31:10] <misterm> chjj: the fact that some people use CS for the wrong reasons has nothing to do with anything
[02:31:25] <misterm> chjj: if you avoided everything that people used for the wrong reasons, you'd never program again
[02:31:34] <fruitbat> or a way to find ul's without lis?
[02:31:41] <chjj> you dont think it tries to perpetuate itself with that, it couldve kept JS' syntax easily
[02:31:44] <chjj> but it chose not to
[02:31:52] <Jayflux> anyone know why my setTimeouts don't work? http://jsfiddle.net/FwnQG/ ?
[02:31:56] <chjj> instead it decided to play on a trend
[02:32:12] <misterm> chjj: that's not a reasonable argument
[02:32:24] <misterm> chjj: obviously there was a decision to go with a certain syntax
[02:32:36] <misterm> chjj: and obviously you may not like it, and that's a fair opinion to have
[02:32:48] <misterm> chjj: that's a reason to avoid it for you personally, and that's fine
[02:33:00] <misterm> chjj: but that's not an objective rational argument against it
[02:33:07] <chjj> why did it go with something so utterly foreign to JS' syntax though, if its supposed to be a "thin layer" on top of it?
[02:33:26] <misterm> chjj: the syntax was chosen for succintness and expressiveness
[02:33:27] <nail_> Jayflux: because setTimeout takes a function as parameter, jQuery(this).find('ul').slideDown() returns a jQuery object, so wrap that in a function() { ... }
[02:34:07] <chjj> and?
[02:34:10] <Jayflux> ok nail_  thanks
[02:34:28] <chjj> thats a good enough reason to ditch the language's syntax entirely?
[02:34:39] <chjj> assuming of course that that is objectively correct
[02:34:42] <misterm> chjj: obviously the users of CS feel so
[02:35:03] <misterm> chjj: I'd also note that it does not "entirely" ditch JS syntax
[02:35:16] <misterm> chjj: if you want something that is a superset of JS, that exists
[02:35:31] <misterm> chjj: That's what I'd say, is that developers have different ways of thinking
[02:36:02] <misterm> chjj: and I think some people underestimate how beneficial it can be to use something that was made by someone who thinks like you
[02:36:45] <misterm> chjj: some people are just more comfortable with significant whitespace, and the very small overhead of using CS can be a big win for them when taken with the other features
[02:36:46] <chjj> not quite sure what that means
[02:36:52] <chjj> but thanks, i guess
[02:36:57] <orolin> exit
[02:37:49] <fruitbat> I'm using draggables and droppables. Does anyone know how to the ORIGINAL parent of the item has been dragged?
[02:38:50] <chjj> misterm: i dont care about them, people who choose to use it, fine, my problem is with the language itself and how its used
[02:39:09] <chjj> if its used because of the reasons i mentioned, i dont like it
[02:39:18] <misterm> chjj: sure, I'm just saying some of the things you mentioned don't exist
[02:39:34] <misterm> chjj: like I said, there's valid reasons not to like it, I don't dispute that at all
[02:39:34] <chjj> such as?
[02:39:54] <misterm> chjj: "it doesn't use prototypes", "people learn it to avoid learning JS", etc
[02:39:55] <yogurt_truck> you don't like a language because of the reasons it's used by other people?
[02:40:03] <DNukem> Hello, i've got <tr>'s which i iterate with each and if they hasClass(x) i want to slideToggle them, of course all animations run atonce. how do i queue this?
[02:40:15] <chjj> i never said it doesnt use prototypes, please dont put quotes around that
[02:40:34] <misterm> fruitbat: can you cache a reference to it? I'm not sure if dragable/dropable will do that for you
[02:40:35] <sacho> DNukem: why not $('tr.x')
[02:40:40] <NoNoNo> DNukem: $('TR.x').slideToggle()
[02:40:46] <chjj> i said it encourages use of something inferior, not as a shortcut, but as an alternative
[02:40:51] <misterm> chjj: you implied that CS classes are more distinct from prototypes than they are
[02:40:56] <fotoflo> sacho: thanks!  So let me see if i get this straight.  A click event calls Change() change binds an event to it's parent, that event bubbles up to the parent too. so you have to stop propagation or else you get the parent getting clicked as well, correct?
[02:41:02] <johnline3> thanks guys, i found the code i was looking for: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1981645/stagger-jquery-animations
[02:41:06] <misterm> chjj: yes, and that's not true
[02:41:23] <chjj> why is it there then? if theres barely any difference, why have it?
[02:41:33] <misterm> chjj: CS forces you to use prototypes, so I don't see how you can say that it's inferiour to prototypes
[02:41:44] <misterm> cjheath: if keyboard chortcuts do the same thing as menus, why are they there?
[02:41:49] <sacho> fotoflo: When you click on INNER, the event eventually "bubbles up" the dom, checking for events in OUTER as well
[02:41:55] <sacho> fotoflo: unless you stop that propagation.
[02:42:06] <misterm> chjj: ^
[02:42:21] <chjj> ok if were getting semantic again, grep every line i said with prototypes in it, and replace it with prototype syntax
[02:42:51] <fotoflo> sacho: inner and outer (defined by pixel position)? or parent and child (defined by DOM Tree location)?
[02:42:57] <sacho> dom tree
[02:43:00] <misterm> chjj: here's a better analogy: if jQuery doesn't do anything you can't do with vanilla JS, why use it?
[02:43:07] <sacho> I should have used parent and child, sorry
[02:43:16] <misterm> chjj: because it's a little more complex than grep, and if you did replicate it, then why not just use CS?
[02:43:24] <chjj> well, i dont use jquery, but ill respond to that anyway, jquery isnt a JS lib, its a DOM lib
[02:43:44] <misterm> chjj: well I don't thinkt hat's a meaningful distinction
[02:43:45] <fotoflo> sacho: cool, thank you!
[02:43:52] <sacho> because noone wants to "do" things with the DOM. That's dirty.
[02:44:06] <chjj> i do, because JS is MUCH more consistent among browsers and js engines
[02:44:07] <misterm> chjj: but I'd also say it's incorrect...jQuery is largely focused on the DOM but also has other helpers
[02:44:13] <chjj> DOM is all ruined accross all browsers
[02:44:25] <chjj> xbrowser compatibility is a joke with regards to DOM, but not JS
[02:44:35] <misterm> chjj: sure, but that's not the point
[02:45:03] <misterm> chjj: the point is it's a utility to save labor, express things more clear, etc
[02:45:21] <chjj> yes it is, i just gave you a good reason to use jquery, even though it doesnt do anything you couldnt normally do
[02:45:34] <chjj> CS doesnt enforce compatibility
[02:45:34] <misterm> chjj: sure, and CS has similar reasons
[02:45:38] <chjj> not really, no
[02:45:50] <misterm> chjj: it creates compatibility across browsers just like jQuery
[02:45:58] <chjj> anything in CS is extremely trivial to do normally, and doesnt require any esoteric knowledge stretching back to bugs from 1997
[02:45:59] <misterm> chjj: it adds features and some paradigms
[02:46:06] <chjj> jquery does
[02:46:42] <misterm> chjj: sure, but I think that's a rather meaningless distinction to draw
[02:47:01] <DNukem> sacho, NoNoNo: these elements have mor classes and if its not the first class in list, this doesnt work, or am i wrong? will this have the wished effect btw?
[02:47:03] <misterm> chjj: are you really telling me you don't believe in labor saving devices
[02:47:10] <chjj> you asked me a question, i answered it, and then said my response is meaningless, i guess i cant win when you make the rules
[02:47:16] <chjj> you said*
[02:47:35] <misterm> chjj: that's not fair
[02:47:42] <chjj> i havent found anything in CS i could do by hand extremely trivially
[02:47:44] <misterm> chjj: I said I don't think it's a meaningful distinction
[02:47:52] <misterm> chjj: in any one instance, sure
[02:47:58] <chjj> ive seen *a lot* of things in jquery that are an absolute bitch to do by hand
[02:48:06] <misterm> chjj: but if you program tons and tons of JS like me, that adds up
[02:48:17] <chjj> i do program tons of js, i use it every day
[02:48:22] <misterm> chjj: maybe you feel the tradeoff is not worth it, and that's a valid opinion
[02:48:30] <chjj> i have tens of thousands of lines of code in my github repos, you can check if you like
[02:48:31] <DNukem> sacho: works, but has the same effect i had inb4 all animations on the trs with that class run atonce
[02:48:36] <misterm> chjj: but the point is it does save labor for some people, and that's a useful goal to have
[02:49:09] <DNukem> i want them to animate as they were one element
[02:49:23] <chjj> okay, my problem is not with those people, although i do think what theyre doing is not worth it, they dont as bug me as much as the other things
[02:49:28] <chjj> you dont have to justify that to me
[02:49:50] <misterm> chjj: well it seemed to me like you were saying CS has no reason to exist, I'm just establishing that it does
[02:50:05] <chjj> well it definitely has a reason to exist
[02:50:09] <chjj> otherwise it wouldnt
[02:50:09] <misterm> chjj: I'll agree that for some people, that reason may not be enough...but that doesn't make CS pointless
[02:50:39] <chjj> whether it has good reasons to exist, whether its useful or harmful, whether i think its stupid or not, those questions are all up in the air beyond that
[02:51:10] <misterm> chjj: sure, it just seems to me like you keep extrapolating your personal decisions into some sort of objective comprehensive statement about CS
[02:51:27] <chjj> how many times have i stated that my position is very subjective?
[02:51:30] <chjj> how many?
[02:52:00] <chjj> they were definitely formed on a subjective basis, although they may leak onto the plane of objectivity
[02:52:03] <misterm> chjj: sure, but that you say thing which I interpret to imply things that are fairly wrong/insulting
[02:52:04] <fruitbat> misterm: ok, i'll have to use data[] or I'm trying to get empty <ul> but can't figuire the selector out!
[02:52:53] <chjj> misterm: sorry? i didnt understand your last message
[02:52:56] <misterm> chjj: you can say you're being subjective until you're blue in the face, but when you make statements that seem to make objective assertions about CS/the people who use it...it sort of cancels it out
[02:53:22] <sacho> DNukem: I'm not sure you can do that, since jquery animations have a queue through which they are executed
[02:53:34] <chjj> see my above message
[02:53:41] <chjj> i think i answered this point before you brought it up
[02:53:56] <misterm> chjj: many times you've said things that imply to me "CS was only made because people wanted to be cool" or "people who use it only do so because they don'y know JS"
[02:54:05] <jasim_> hey, can you tell me how to obtain the css property of a hover element?
[02:54:08] <misterm> chjj: you've made statements like that many times, and those are what I object to
[02:54:13] <jasim_> $("a:hover") doesn't cut it.
[02:54:31] <chjj> okay, i dont care if you do, thats fine, i dont expect to change anyones mind, all i can say is i dont like it
[02:54:35] <misterm> chjj: in addition, I think some of the points you made are just factually incorrect, like the prototypes...but we went over that...the rest I agree depends on taste
[02:54:39] <chjj> and i can give my reasons
[02:54:44] <chjj> and i might even defend my reasons
[02:54:59] <misterm> chjj: sure, I just wish you would stick to facts is what I'm saying
[02:55:21] <misterm> chjj: there's plenty of actual arguments to be made instead of taking cheap shots at the people who made/use it
[02:55:38] <chjj> dont get me wrong, me saying this is not a concession that my reasons arent based in fact, just that i dont care to prove them as much as i should
[02:56:09] <chjj> id *much* rather take cheap shots
[02:56:15] <chjj> oh yes
[02:56:19] <chjj> much more fun that way
[02:57:07] <misterm> chjj: to me those things might as well be one and the same, conceding that your reasons aren't factual/not defending them I mean
[02:57:33] <chjj> or i can give my reasons, and like - i - said, i might even defend them, but im not about to write a treatise on the subject, cite my sources and publish the thing
[02:57:48] <misterm> chjj: but sure, if you have no problem with taking cheap shots that's fine I guess
[02:58:05] <misterm> chjj: as long as you realize that's what you're doing and not making actual arguments or points
[02:58:32] <chjj> sure, but it doesnt mean that my reasons are invalid
[02:58:47] <misterm> chjj: the ones that are just cheap shots, yes invalid
[02:58:59] <misterm> chjj: the ones that are your opinions/decisions are of course valid
[02:58:59] <chjj> youre the one who needs to convince me thats its a good thing worth using, because i dont care to convince anyone
[02:59:15] <blup> anyone know of a jquery plugin that achieves an effect similar to the Pulse app (iphone/android)?
[02:59:55] <chjj> why else do you think im writing poems in the style of the lord of the rings that makes fun of CS?
[02:59:59] <misterm> chjj: all I need to do is back up my assertions with fact, or admit my opinions are opinions, that's all anyone needs to do
[03:00:44] <chjj> might be a little offtopic, but you strike me as someone who just got introduced to formal logic and are having a bit of fun with it
[03:01:17] <misterm> chjj: intimately familiar with and found of logic? of course...I'm a programmer
[03:01:19] <VictorBjelkholm> I need some help with selecting an element...  http://pastebin.com/Th0wQSf9
[03:01:31] <misterm> chjj: just introduced? no
[03:01:31] <VictorBjelkholm> $(this).closest('.singleThread').find('.number').html(response);
[03:01:37] <chjj> right, im specifically talking about formal logic though
[03:01:43] <chjj> nevermind
[03:01:46] <VictorBjelkholm> that line doesn't hit .number in the current .singleThread
[03:01:51] <misterm> chjj: yes, I got that
[03:02:34] <sacho> DNukem: hmm, from what I can see, all the animations run at the same time.
[03:02:55] <chjj> anyway, who wants to try my monster of a markdown parser?
[03:02:58] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: have you tried logging your jQuery objects to make sure you're getting back what you think you are?
[03:03:06] <misterm> chjj: link it up
[03:03:19] <chjj> https://github.com/chjj/marked/blob/master/lib/marked.js
[03:03:29] <VictorBjelkholm> misterm, I'm getting back the thing I want but I can't figure out how to select the thing I want
[03:03:49] <chjj> its almost perfected, i just need to optimizing parsing of "loose" list items
[03:04:04] <chjj> but its around 3 times faster than any md compiler ive benchmarked it against
[03:04:42] <VictorBjelkholm> misterm, if I try to set html() to html("hejsan") will not change anything
[03:04:55] <chjj> someone should test it on the client-side for me, i didnt even try it, i just assumed it worked ;p
[03:05:09] <chjj> it should though
[03:07:36] <DNukem> sacho: this is right, there is the "queue()" function, that can create queues with your own name or queue a function, but i dont get how to use that in this case, i have to queue dynamically one tr after the other whith specific class
[03:08:25] <DNukem> in short, i cant wrap the respective elements in divs or spans to animate them as one element, but the effect should look like that
[03:08:55] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: which jQuery objects did you try logging, and where?
[03:10:06] <johnline3> if i do .css('opacity','0') in jquery, will it apply the special retarded filters to have opacity in ie too?
[03:10:18] <VictorBjelkholm> misterm, if I change $(this).closest.... to alert(response); I'll get a popup with the response variable
[03:10:42] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: that's not what I mean, although that's good too
[03:11:00] <VictorBjelkholm> yeah, I'm sure that the selector is wrong
[03:11:08] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: are you sure that $(this) is what you want it to be? What about $(this).closest('.singleThread')
[03:11:09] <chjj> johnline3: yes it will
[03:11:24] <johnline3> thanks chjj
[03:11:28] <VictorBjelkholm> the selector worked before it was in the $.get function
[03:11:30] <chjj> at least every dom library ive ever seen does that
[03:11:33] <johnline3> this is why jq is awesome
[03:12:10] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: sure, but what is it in Javascript that changes every time you execute a function, unless you explicitly force it to something else, or it is bound
[03:12:20] <sacho> DNukem: What I meant is, if you trigger animation on several elements, they all get animated at the same time: http://jsfiddle.net/63wmu/
[03:12:35] <VictorBjelkholm> misterm, no idea
[03:12:45] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: I'll give you a hint $(this) is not really a selector
[03:12:57] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: what it does is take whatever "this" is, and wrap it in a jQuery object
[03:13:58] <VictorBjelkholm> but in my case, what is "this"? If it's outside the $.get-function, it works. Inside = no go
[03:14:18] <VictorBjelkholm> I don't understand why and how "this" changes from being outside that function and outside
[03:14:31] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: "this" in Javascript is determined by what function it's inside, and how that function is called
[03:14:48] <VictorBjelkholm> could I simply move up or something in javascript then?
[03:15:11] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: when you do something like $("#foo").click(function(){ ... }) jQuery is nice and will bind the callback function so "this" points to what you might expect
[03:15:41] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: but not always...sometimes there's not an obvious element to bind to
[03:16:00] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: so yea, if what you need is the "this" of an enclosing scope, you basically have to cache it
[03:16:27] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: in the outer scope save a reference to $(this), and in the inner function use it
[03:16:28] <VictorBjelkholm> cache it?
[03:16:32] <VictorBjelkholm> oh
[03:16:36] <VictorBjelkholm> now I get it
[03:16:50] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: something like var myElement = $(this) in the outer scope
[03:17:25] <chjj> in my opinion you should do that more frequently that the chaining style of jquery encourages
[03:17:31] <misterm> VictorBjelkholm: and then in the inner function, myElement.closest, etc...or just var myElement = this, and wrap it later
[03:17:41] <VictorBjelkholm> now it's working
[03:17:46] <VictorBjelkholm> misterm, thanks alot!
[03:17:49] <chjj> a lot of people tend to reselect or rewrap elements unnecessarily
[03:18:04] <chjj> always good to do var el = $('foo');
[03:18:24] <misterm> chjj: that's why I was thinking earlier it's ironic that you complained about CS "hiding" stuff, etc ;-p
[03:18:37] <chjj> hiding stuff?
[03:18:40] <misterm> bbl, must feed cats
[03:18:48] <chjj> ...?
[03:18:49] <newbie> hi, has anyone made experience with the jquery-addon tablesorter?
[03:18:54] <misterm> chjj: you seemed to take issue with it abstracting things
[03:19:14] <misterm> I gotta feed my cats though, I'll be back in a little bit if you want to talk more, or not
[03:19:29] <chjj> okay two things, if i were against abstractions in their entirety, i would be writing native machine code right now
[03:19:42] <chjj> ...
[03:19:51] <RealSolid> is this valid? $blah = $(blah)[x]
[03:20:06] <chjj> why not?
[03:20:10] <xec> newbie: state your entire question, preferably with a live demo of your issue
[03:20:13] <RealSolid> sorry, $blah = $(".blah")[x]
[03:20:24] <chjj> RealSolid: sure, why not?
[03:20:30] <RealSolid> what is $blah pointing at? i cant access the children()
[03:20:35] <RealSolid> it complains
[03:20:52] <chjj> well if youre doing $('.blah')[0], it will get the first real dom element in the collection
[03:20:54] <RealSolid> $blah.children(".off")   results in error
[03:20:57] <xec> what is x?
[03:21:01] <RealSolid> its 0
[03:21:02] <DNukem> sacho: thanks for the example, its what i want in my example with content in trs (unformatted so far, no css) this isnt happening. they loose a bit height and then simply disappear and it does a "flap" instead of a real slide
[03:21:23] <xec> are there any elements with class name blah?
[03:21:27] <RealSolid> yes
[03:21:33] <RealSolid> if i put brackets around it, theres no error
[03:21:34] <xec> are you selecting after DOM is ready?
[03:21:42] <chjj> $('.blah')[0] should return the first element it finds then
[03:21:44] <RealSolid> however it doesnt do anything either
[03:21:57] <RealSolid> $(('.blah')[x])  results in no error
[03:22:05] <xec> lolwut
[03:22:16] <chjj> well, im guessing you meant to put another $ there
[03:22:22] <chjj> that makes you wrap it again
[03:22:27] <RealSolid> hmm
[03:22:34] <chjj> jquery objects are just array-like objects
[03:22:40] <chjj> containing any elements you selected
[03:22:47] <RealSolid> ok that worked
[03:22:47] <newbie> sorry, i can't provide a live-demo right now but to explain my problem: in one column of the table where i use the tablesorter i have a dropdownlist (select) per row. and i want to be able to sort this column by the selected value. is this possible?
[03:22:52] <RealSolid> $($('.blah')[x])
[03:23:03] <RealSolid> is that weird or?
[03:23:13] <xec> why would you do that
[03:23:18] <chjj> RealSolid: well, if you want a jquery object with only on element in it, that works
[03:23:31] <chjj> one*
[03:23:33] <RealSolid> because i do this $blah.children(".off").is(":visible")
[03:23:36] <RealSolid> and it was complaining
[03:23:52] <RealSolid> the double wrapping works
[03:24:32] <xec> RealSolid: maybe you could show us your code?
[03:24:51] <chjj> how is it "complaining"?
[03:25:04] <RealSolid> it was an error, let me show
[03:25:16] <blup> anyone know of a jquery plugin that achieves an effect similar to the Pulse app (iphone/android)?
[03:25:44] <RealSolid> Error: $blah.children is not a function
[03:25:58] <xec> why are you doing [0]
[03:26:09] <RealSolid> because theres multiple divs, and i want to access certain ones
[03:26:10] <chjj> uh
[03:26:12] <RealSolid> depending upon things
[03:26:25] <chjj> then $blah is not a jquery object, how are you setting $blah in the first place?
[03:26:49] <RealSolid> $blah = $(".blah")[x];  is what gives that error
[03:26:59] <RealSolid> $blah = $($(".blah")[x]);  is what works
[03:27:02] <chjj> right
[03:27:11] <chjj> because youre grabbing the raw dom element from that
[03:27:15] <chjj> you need to wrap it again
[03:27:17] <DNukem> may it be that td's inside of the trs are not animating??
[03:27:25] <misterm> chjj: obviously uou are not against *all* abstractions, I was just saying CS and jQuery (as well as a lot of libs) are both abstractions over Javascript, and are abused by some people to avoid learning javascript
[03:28:00] <chjj> well jquery is a very different thing, its a dom library and doesnt offer too much in the way of js
[03:28:19] <misterm> chjj: sure, they abstract different things, but the end result is the same
[03:28:21] <newbie> xec: i need this functionality because the selects contain dates which need to be sortable
[03:28:23] <chjj> but even so, how was me offering a suggestion contrary to anything i might have said, even if i were totally anti-jquery?
[03:28:24] <xec> RealSolid: maybe you want $('.blah').eq(x) instead
[03:28:36] <RealSolid> what is .eq ?
[03:28:41] <xec> equals
[03:28:42] <chjj> i can still offer advice even though i disagree with something
[03:28:48] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[03:29:00] <misterm> chjj: like I said, I was mostly just riffing on the fact that we're in jQuery, and also pointing out that it's not an issue that's unique to CS
[03:29:00] <chjj> if you do drugs i might disagree with it, but you can at least wash the needle
[03:29:16] <misterm> chjj: I'm not really sure what you're getting at
[03:29:26] <RealSolid> that also works :P
[03:29:37] <chjj> im very confused by you
[03:29:42] <misterm> chjj: my point is only that some of the issues you bring up against CS are just as bad in many popular JS libraries, although you may not be against them
[03:30:00] <misterm> chjj: maybe you are against libraries, I don't know
[03:30:14] <chjj> jquery is *hardly* cs, but i dont use jquery either
[03:30:21] <xec> RealSolid: when you use [x] you don't get a jQuery object, you get the DOM element, .eq() returns jQuery
[03:30:41] <RealSolid> ah
[03:30:44] <chjj> jquery does solve a lot more necessary problems than CS, i dont think CS solves problems really, i think jquery is okay as an abstraction
[03:30:48] <misterm> chjj: sure, they are different things...but in terms of some of your objections like portability, abstraction, splintering the community, they are *exactly* the same
[03:31:10] <chjj> jquery is incredibly portable, are you kidding, it is *the* dom library
[03:31:14] <misterm> chjj: sure, obviously your contention is that one is worth it more, but I'm just pointing out that they share problems
[03:31:17] <chjj> which inspired many look-alikes
[03:31:24] <misterm> chjj: it's not portable in the same way CS is not-portable
[03:31:25] <chjj> many of whoms function names are the same
[03:31:34] <misterm> chjj: I would argue both of them are equally portable
[03:31:45] <xec> what's CS?
[03:31:57] <chjj> nothing, pay no mind :)
[03:32:00] <misterm> chjj: you can port JS code to CS just as easily as you can port say jQuery to YUI
[03:32:08] <xec> coffeescript?
[03:32:10] <misterm> chjj: obviously the reverse is not a problem
[03:32:29] <chjj> i really dont think theres any grounds to compare these things
[03:32:35] <misterm> chjj: how so?
[03:32:49] <misterm> chjj: I would argue it's silly to call either "non-portable"
[03:32:56] <chjj> well, one is a DOM library, which even, in theory could have been implemented in any language, and has been
[03:33:12] <misterm> chjj: yea, but that has nothing to do with the particular issue at hand
[03:33:13] <chjj> the other is an abstraction on top of js that uses it as an intermediate language
[03:33:55] <xec> newbie: sorry, i don't know the answer to your question, but if you manage to make a demo on jsfiddle.net for instance, maybe someone will take a shot
[03:34:41] <misterm> chjj: a race care and an electric generator or very different things, but if you are talking about how it's bad to rely on fossil fuels, those differences are irrelvent...we're disscussing "portablility" and it's equally dubious to talk about either in that regard
[03:34:48] <fotoflo> I'm back with another zany problem!  I am doing an AJAX request and getting "Resource interpreted as script but transferred with MIME type application/json"  as my response
[03:34:58] <fotoflo> in the chrome debugger anyway
[03:35:25] <chjj> youre the one who brought this up by saying that im against abstractions, and then you shifted focus to portability for some reason, youre tiring me out
[03:35:32] <fotoflo> anyone know whats up with that?
[03:35:33] <chjj> okay, so now were talking about portability
[03:35:38] <misterm> chjj: that's simply not true
[03:35:54] <chjj> please dont make me copy and paste what you said
[03:36:06] <misterm> chjj: please do
[03:36:10] <xec> nerdfight!
[03:36:14] <misterm> chjj: I know what I said, you simply misinterpreted it
[03:36:20] <chjj> 05:18:25  misterm chjj: you seemed to take issue with it abstracting things
[03:36:24] * xec gets popcorn
[03:36:32] <misterm> chjj: yes, and that's exactly what you said
[03:36:42] <misterm> chjj: notice, nowhere did I say "you are against all abstractions"
[03:37:06] <misterm> chjj: I'd note if you misinterpreted that fair enough, I already clarified what I was talking about
[03:37:12] <chjj> well, you said that it was specifically the reason you claimed it was "ironic" that i was in here, because jquery is an abstraction
[03:37:28] <chjj> and then you shifted focus to portability
[03:37:33] <chjj> youre tiring me out to hell
[03:37:38] <misterm> chjj: What I said is that a lot of the criticism you have of CS also apply to jQuery
[03:37:51] <misterm> chjj: abstraction and portability are both in that category
[03:38:01] <chjj> jquery is extraordinarily portable
[03:38:06] <misterm> chjj: there's no shifting involved...you just keep trying to drag character attacks into things
[03:38:10] <misterm> chjj: of course, so is CS
[03:38:13] <chjj> i have no problem with abstraction
[03:38:17] <chjj> no problem at all
[03:38:19] <ruby_on_tails> i have an input tag, on an event i want to clone it somewhere else on the page, but if the users writes something in that input, the tag clones successfully, but the user inputted value doesnt go along, why ?
[03:38:27] <misterm> chjj: that's the entire point...it's equally silly to refer to either as "non portable"
[03:38:27] <chjj> especially dom abstraction, the dom is absolutely unusable otherwise
[03:38:40] <misterm> chjj: and if you don't, fair enough...but that's not what some of your comments earlier suggested
[03:38:59] <misterm> chjj: for example your comments on inheritence
[03:39:13] <chjj> i almost just want to start scrolling through my history, it would be easier than repeating myself
[03:39:25] <misterm> chjj: you suggested you didn't like CS's abstractions, if I misinterpreted you by all means correct me
[03:39:26] <chjj> abstracting the dom is *very* necessary
[03:39:34] <misterm> chjj: nobody ever said it wasn't
[03:39:38] <chjj> abstracting javascript in the way cs does, *very* unnecessary
[03:39:55] <misterm> chjj: well that's an opinion
[03:39:58] <misterm> chjj: which is fine
[03:40:10] <misterm> chjj: my point is I'm trying to get you to make an important distinction
[03:40:19] <chjj> i know its an opinion, im telling you my position which you keep trying to mischaracterize
[03:40:37] <chjj> i have no problem with abstractions, if theyre necessary
[03:40:57] <misterm> chjj: not at all, you just keep misunderstanding me
[03:41:34] <misterm> chjj: what I am saying is that there's a big difference between making comments about the abstractions in CS being dumb, and commenting that you don't think they are worth it
[03:42:09] <chjj> those two things arent mutually exclusive, i can hold both of those beliefs
[03:42:17] <chjj> in fact i think the first one entails the second one
[03:42:33] <misterm> chjj: the abstractions serve a demonstrable use, they save energy in writing and reading for the users...if you want to argue that for some people the abstraction is counterproductive for you, or not worth other drawbacks fine
[03:42:43] <oal> I have an iframe and I want to detect the height of the body inside of it and set it's height to that value. How?
[03:42:45] <misterm> chjj: that's a well thought out and objective position
[03:42:53] <misterm> chjj: saying "CS abstract this and that's bad
[03:43:02] <misterm> is an opinion, and not based on anything
[03:43:09] <chjj> misterm: i completely agree, im all for abstractions when they make sense, when theyre useful
[03:43:21] <misterm> chjj: sure, and the abstractions in CS are useful
[03:43:35] <misterm> chjj: maybe not useful for you period, or not useful enough to offset other things
[03:43:46] <misterm> chjj: and thats fine, but that's an important distinction to make
[03:43:53] <chjj> you originally said that CS class syntax made things easier, when i called you on it, you changed your answer, i dont know what your position is on that now
[03:44:02] <chjj> is class syntax an abstraction designed to make things easier?
[03:44:04] <misterm> chjj: I didn't change my answer at all
[03:44:12] <chjj> ok
[03:44:21] <misterm> chjj: I don't know why you keep trying to turn this into a chracter asssasination
[03:44:40] <chjj> im just saying i dont know what your position on it is now because of that
[03:44:44] <chjj> what is it?
[03:44:46] <misterm> chjj: fine, fair enough
[03:44:47] <chjj> is class syntax an abstraction designed to make things easier?
[03:45:06] <misterm> chjj: yes, easier in certain ways for certain people
[03:45:12] <chjj> okay
[03:45:38] <cfooo> Hi i have an image that i want to use as background in the bottom right. It's supposed to stick with it's size even if i zoom. But resize if I change the window size. I managed to do this but I cant get it to change right if the screen resolution changes from aspect ratio 16:9 or 4:3.. Anyone got a clue what I should do? I hope you understand what i mean otherwise i can give u the url and u
[03:45:38] <cfooo> can check it yourself! thanks
[03:45:49] <chjj> i dont see tham as easier, and i certainly dont see them as necessary, especially when its a kind of mock class implementation like you say
[03:46:04] <misterm> chjj: sure, that's fine
[03:46:21] <misterm> chjj: there's easier in the sense that they take on the effort of creating the pattern for you
[03:46:30] <chjj> which is why im against it, not because its an abstraction, but because its needless
[03:46:46] <misterm> chjj: so they save physical labor in terms of typing, and than energy labor in terms of reading and understanding the code
[03:47:05] <chjj> well i guess im strange then, i actually like coding, i dont consider it physical labor
[03:47:14] <misterm> chjj: sure, the only problem I have with the statement you made is you need to add (for me) to the end
[03:47:24] <misterm> chjj: typing is provably physical labor
[03:47:39] <misterm> chjj: obviously it's not super strenuous or anything, but that's besides the point
[03:47:47] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/4GbRR/4/  <- I have a html table organized like a tree... now I would like to make a selector, that would remove all siblings from my row until next row with the same level class.... if I click on first row of level2... all sibling rows (until next level 2) should be removed. any ideas?
[03:47:50] <JKarsrud> Are you guys still discussing anonymous function expression closures? :P
[03:48:18] <misterm> JKarsrud: no, and we never were real,l :p
[03:48:19] <chjj> i never said it wasnt technically physical labor, merely that i dont consider it such, because i enjoy coding, i like it, im a programmer
[03:48:23] <chjj> i dont need my thinking done for me
[03:48:27] <chjj> i dont need my work done for me
[03:48:33] <misterm> chjj: sure but I think that's a mischaracterization
[03:48:40] <Lion31> or for first level 1, all rows until next level 1
[03:48:42] <misterm> chjj: it's not about "enjoying" programming
[03:48:49] <misterm> chjj: or something "doing your thinking for you"
[03:48:59] <misterm> chjj: it's about everyone programming *in their own style*
[03:49:12] <misterm> chjj: would you agree that everyone has different taste in music?
[03:49:22] <misterm> chjj: and that different musicians have different "styles"?
[03:49:44] <JKarsrud> Lion31: have you seen ?nextUntil
[03:49:46] <JKarsrud> ?
[03:49:48] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/4GbRR/5/  <-- updated with INT level
[03:49:50] <chjj> if thats not meant for rhetoric, it should be, because if youre waiting for an answer you wont get one
[03:49:56] <JKarsrud> ?nextUntil
[03:49:56] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[03:50:01] <misterm> chjj: musicians in these different styles will use different instruments
[03:50:03] <Lion31> JKarsrudL no, will check
[03:50:06] <JKarsrud> or ?prevUntil
[03:50:13] <misterm> chjj: and programmers with different styles will use different tools
[03:50:29] <misterm> chjj: when you use a tool that matches your style, that's a productive win
[03:50:36] <misterm> chjj: and when you use one that doesn't, it's a loss
[03:51:03] <DNukem> sacho: if you still here, that describes my problem, the text jumps of course if its in one line http://jsfiddle.net/63wmu/
[03:51:10] <misterm> chjj: so I think the only way to have a discussion about CS is to make sure you are discussing in those terms, because there's precios little that you can truly objectively discuss
[03:51:27] <chjj> so if i can get this straight now, you brought this up again, to say that i dont like abstractions, and tehn to talking about portability for a brief second, all to ultimately tell me that everyone has their own style?
[03:51:47] <misterm> chjj: no not at all
[03:52:11] <sacho> DNukem: I don't think it does
[03:52:15] <chjj> i agree, everyone has their own style, they can have their own style, i dont care
[03:52:24] <chjj> you cant tell me i should like it though
[03:52:34] <chjj> you can tell me i shouldnt be disgusted by it, because i am
[03:52:38] <chjj> cant*
[03:52:40] <misterm> chjj: no, and I never have
[03:52:43] <misterm> chjj: not once
[03:52:49] <chjj> then why do you keep bringing this up?
[03:53:01] <misterm> chjj: but I can tell you that you should distinguish what is based on facts and what is just your subjective opinion
[03:53:04] <misterm> chjj: I didn't really
[03:53:35] <misterm> chjj:much  earlier I made a point about how a lot of the things you were objecting to happen in libraries as well, but you don't neccesarily object to them
[03:53:48] <misterm> chjj: then something happened that well illustrated my point
[03:53:57] <chjj> you can play that game all you want, it will always come down to opinion
[03:54:01] <misterm> chjj: so I joking said "see?" and was ready to leave it at that
[03:54:14] <misterm> chjj: but then you asked me questions and I answered them
[03:54:21] <newbie> i made a quick example to my tablesorter-problem on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hYRUA/2/
[03:54:32] <chjj> and i explained why
[03:54:37] <misterm> chjj: I'm not playing any games with opinions, all I've been saying is that basically all you have is your opinion
[03:54:51] <misterm> chjj: which is fine, and I'm not trying to invalidate it in any way
[03:55:05] <misterm> chjj: I just think it needs to be recognized as opinion, I think that's an important distinction
[03:55:18] <chjj> everything is technically an opinion
[03:55:28] <chjj> some opinions can be very valid though
[03:55:31] <misterm> chjj: some things are more opinion than others
[03:55:35] <Lion31> JKarsrudL: You are da MAN! thank you nextUntil works perfectly!!!
[03:56:06] <misterm> chjj: and I think in this case, all of your arguments are either technically wrong, subjective, or you invalidate them yourself by not applying them to everything
[03:56:32] <chjj> like i said, i dont care, the only thing that let you drag me into this again was you throwing out the remark that it was "ironic" for me to be in here
[03:56:45] <misterm> chjj: the ones that are subjective are totally fine, no problem with that at all
[03:56:49] <chjj> because i offered someone advice
[03:56:54] <chjj> on a library i dont even use
[03:56:57] <misterm> chjj: that's not what happened at all
[03:57:08] <misterm> chjj: you offering advice has nothing to do with anything
[03:57:23] <misterm> chjj: all I said was some of your points were ironic considering what chatroom we are, and that was a JOKE
[03:57:26] <chjj> 5:17:34  chjj always good to do var el = $('foo');
[03:57:26] <chjj> 05:17:55  misterm chjj: that's why I was thinking earlier it's ironic that you  complained about CS "hiding" stuff, etc ;-p
[03:57:52] <misterm> chjj: sure bot those two things are not related, you just misunderstood me
[03:58:04] <cfooo> Can someone please just look at my resizing problem, pherhaps its very easy for you guys..
[03:58:30] <misterm> chjj: when I say "that's why" what I am refering to was the gentleperson earlier who was confused by what $(this) is, it had nothing to do with anything you might have said at the time
[03:59:11] <chjj> sorry, what was it referring to then?
[03:59:21] <chjj> i guess you just randomly decided to throw it out there
[03:59:31] <chjj> cause apparently it had nothing to do with anything
[03:59:38] <misterm> chjj: it wasn't random at all, it was directly related to what just happened in the chatroom
[03:59:51] <misterm> chjj: or *what had just happened rather
[04:00:09] <misterm> chjj: I would have thought that my explanation after I said that would make it clear
[04:00:25] <chjj> you didnt offer an explanation, you upped and left
[04:00:29] <chjj> to feed some cats or something
[04:00:32] <misterm> chjj: not at all
[04:00:36] <amit_usual> is there a way i can access a normal rss feed using jsonp
[04:00:42] <misterm> chjj: I did explain it, and I've explained it several times since
[04:00:51] <misterm> chjj: you just keep missing the point or something
[04:00:56] <chjj> so, explain it to me now in case i missed it?
[04:01:04] <chjj> what was ironic about it?
[04:01:11] <misterm> chjj: earlier you made comments about how people "learn CS instead of JS"
[04:01:12] <chjj> why is me being in here ironic?
[04:01:21] <DNukem> if for gods sake someone is intereseted: animating <tr> with slide, will only slide until the min height of the tr, and then simply hide this rest height. depending on content and your css, you cant animte here. (of course it is here sadly not possible for me to use something else instead of the table)
[04:01:25] <misterm> chjj: that's not quite what I said
[04:01:45] <misterm> chjj: what I said was, some of your comments were ironic given the chatroom we are in
[04:01:55] <chjj> jquery is hardly a substitute for js, its not a language either (well cs isnt much of a language either, but you see what im saying)
[04:01:57] <misterm> chjj: because you could be talking about jQuery instead of CS
[04:02:00] <Cap_Africa> hello
[04:02:05] <misterm> chjj: and that was a JOKE
[04:02:27] <misterm> chjj: however, there is a real point that a lot of your points could be applied to *ANY LIBRARY*
[04:02:41] <chjj> like i said, jquery performs a very necessary abstraction, its not that the dom is merely inconvenient to use, *it* *is* *unusable*
[04:03:02] <misterm> chjj: sure but saying this abstraction is neccesary and this one is not is fairly subjective
[04:03:08] <chjj> js on the other hand is surpisingly well and uniformly implemented
[04:03:22] <misterm> chjj: and that's not the only point at hand
[04:03:37] <misterm> chjj: it's not just about abstractions, it's about hipsterism and coddeling people as well
[04:04:06] <chjj> you were the one who brought up abstractions, now youre saying im not talking these subjects enough
[04:04:17] <Cap_Africa> can anyone help me make a jquery picture gallery like facebook
[04:04:30] <chjj> sure its not just about abstraction, but dont switch topics every time you lose footing and then accuse me of not covering enough
[04:04:40] <misterm> chjj: not at all, I'm merely pointing out it's not the only issue
[04:04:50] <misterm> chjj: anyway, here's the point
[04:04:55] <misterm> chjj: your argument is incomplete
[04:04:59] <chjj> obviously i agree, im the one who mentioned the damn things in the first place
[04:05:10] <chjj> you dont need to remind me
[04:05:12] <misterm> chjj: you can't say "this abstraction good, this one bad" without saying wht
[04:05:13] <chjj> i remember, i was there
[04:05:21] <chjj> i just said what
[04:05:25] <misterm> chjj: *unless* you are just saying it as an opinion
[04:05:27] <chjj> i just said what, several times
[04:05:46] <misterm> chjj: you said jQuery's abstraction is ok because it's neccesary, right?
[04:05:57] <misterm> chjj: but CS is bad because it's not?
[04:06:02] <chjj> im sorry that i have to spell this out again, dom abstraction === necessary, js abstraction === unnecessary
[04:06:12] <misterm> chjj: you don't need to spell it out again
[04:06:13] <cfooo> Please anyone: http://85.17.155.131/~michelkova/index.php resizing issue on bg
[04:06:22] <chjj> well you couldve fooled me
[04:06:25] <misterm> chjj: I think it's pretty telling that you consistently misunderstand me
[04:06:26] <chjj> and did
[04:06:38] <chjj> oh definitely
[04:06:54] <chjj> im glad you can acknowledge your own failure of communication
[04:06:57] <misterm> chjj: ok, so here's what you seem to miss
[04:07:25] <misterm> chjj: you don't seem to understand, that you are just making  a massive assumption and taking it for granted
[04:07:47] <misterm> chjj: you just assume "abstraction is bad" end of story
[04:08:05] <misterm> chjj: obviously you think in some cases, abstraction is LESS BAD than other things
[04:08:09] <misterm> chjj: like say, the DOM
[04:08:19] <chjj> when did i say that? i just said abstraction is *necessary* in many cases
[04:08:25] <misterm> chjj: but your point seems to be "abstraction needs to be avoided like the plague unless absolutely neccesary"
[04:08:38] <misterm> chjj: just now, when you repeated yourself for no reason
[04:09:01] <chjj> when did i say "abstraction is bad, end of story"
[04:09:15] <misterm> chjj: the point is, you can't say that the abstraction in CS serves absolutely no purpose and still be honest....you can say it serves no purpose for you...but that doesn't apply to everyone
[04:09:25] <chjj> how does "abstractions are necessary" equal "abstractions are bad, end of story"?
[04:09:27] <misterm> chjj: that is an unsaid assumption in your point
[04:09:48] <chjj> it serves a purpose, theres a reason for it to exist
[04:09:55] <misterm> chjj: otherwise why would you make the point that "jQuery needs to abstract and CS doesn't?"
[04:10:04] <chjj> ive said that before, theres definitely a reason that it came about, otherwise it wouldnt be
[04:10:08] <misterm> chjj: sure, but lets say there is abstraction with no purpose
[04:10:12] <misterm> chjj: why is that bad?
[04:10:23] <chjj> because DOM and JS are two different things
[04:10:27] <misterm> chjj: if I have some bread and I don't really need bread...is that a BAD thing?
[04:10:37] <chjj> one is well implemented, one is poorly implemented
[04:10:50] <misterm> chjj: so why is it that if you have abstraction when you don't really need it, it's "bad"
[04:10:55] <chjj> anyway, i gotta go feed some cats or something
[04:10:56] <chjj> seeya
[04:11:28] <misterm> chjj: ha, I'm glad you see you can't defend your points
[04:11:45] <fotoflo> hmm, why doesnt escape() work on chinese characters?
[04:12:49] <misterm> fotoflo: can you define "doesn't work" more specifically?
[04:13:03] <misterm> fotoflo: what are you putting in, what do you expect out, and what are you getting instead?
[04:13:16] <fotoflo> escape(“人人”)
[04:13:42] <fotoflo> thats wierd
[04:13:44] <fotoflo> its working
[04:13:48] <fotoflo> it just gave me an error
[04:14:14] <fotoflo> syntax error unexpected token
[04:14:20] <fotoflo> in one browser tab
[04:14:25] <fotoflo> working in the other
[04:14:56] <misterm> fotoflo: yea I dunno, impossible to say without seeing it ourselves...at least its working though
[04:15:05] <fotoflo> not working in real code
[04:15:11] <fotoflo> gonna keep debugging
[04:15:20] <misterm> good luck
[04:17:22] <misterm> fotoflo: are you sure you don't have any other crazy whitespace chars sneaking in there?
[04:17:41] <fotoflo> yeah
[04:17:54] <misterm> fotoflo: how?
[04:17:54] <fotoflo> I'm not sure I'm using the right encoding though
[04:18:02] <fotoflo> i used debugger and printed it out
[04:18:30] <misterm> fotoflo: well probably I should say "nonvisible" because they may not technically be whitespace
[04:20:09] <fotoflo> i think i should be using encodeURI() and not encode()
[04:20:17] <fotoflo> err escape
[04:20:39] <misterm> fotoflo: well that may be, but I don't think that's your issue
[04:21:00] <misterm> fotoflo: of course I may be wrong, AFAIK you wouldn't get a syntax error, just not what you want
[04:21:03] <fotoflo> it was
[04:21:11] <fotoflo> :-) it worked
[04:21:35] <fotoflo> thanks though :-)
[04:21:56] <misterm> fotoflo: ok, fyi when I copy/pasted your line from the chat I got a syntax error no matter what function I called...when I reproduced the chars myself, it worked including escape
[04:22:04] * misterm shrugs
[04:22:19] <callumacrae> How would I check where the mouse is? I'm trying to make a menu
[04:22:20] <fotoflo> it might have been the "'s
[04:22:21] <misterm> but it's working now, that's what matters
[04:22:38] <fotoflo> if I'm typing in chinese it gives me different quotes
[04:22:43] <fotoflo> but it wasn't that way in my code...
[04:22:47] <fotoflo> thanks for checking  ;-)
[04:22:51] <misterm> fotoflo: ah yea
[04:23:11] <fotoflo> chinese input methods all have messed up punctiaton
[04:23:13] <misterm> fotoflo: well in that case, your code still shouldn't have thrown a syntax error
[04:23:17] <fotoflo> ，。“ ‘
[04:23:26] <misterm> fotoflo: if that's not how it was in your code
[04:23:35] <fotoflo> i was getting a syntax error in the console
[04:23:37] <fotoflo> hehe
[04:23:38] <misterm> fotoflo: yea, I figured it was something like that, just not sure what
[04:23:48] <misterm> fotoflo: ah yea, ok
[04:23:59] <fotoflo> i just assumed it was the same in the code
[04:24:11] <fotoflo> but to ASS U ME makes an ...
[04:24:19] <misterm> fotoflo: oh man, assumptions the programmers worst enemy
[04:24:22] <misterm> yea exactly
[04:25:06] <dlmalloc> I have made a file upload that uses an iframe. The page doesn't refresh and uploading works fine, but the browser behaves as if it is refreshing (I get a spinning "loading" icon for example). How can I stop this? :o
[04:25:49] <blackspotwiggins> dlmalloc, i think that's standard behaviour for iframes
[04:26:02] <blackspotwiggins> you could use ajax to avoid that
[04:26:30] <dlmalloc> blackspotwiggins: But I can't use ajax to submit data. :S
[04:26:41] <blackspotwiggins> why not?
[04:26:43] <dlmalloc> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/ uses iframes, and there's no loading issue.
[04:26:52] <dlmalloc> blackspotwiggins: because I'm sending files.
[04:26:57] <blackspotwiggins> im sending files with ajax
[04:27:06] <dlmalloc> blackspotwiggins: oh really? :O how?
[04:27:21] <blackspotwiggins> formdata for newer browsers
[04:27:30] <blackspotwiggins> manually constructing the payload for older ones
[04:27:40] <blackspotwiggins> it's not super hard
[04:28:07] <dlmalloc> blackspotwiggins: Do you have an example I can look at?
[04:28:13] <blackspotwiggins> no
[04:28:35] <blackspotwiggins> i cant give you my code
[04:28:43] <misterm> dlmalloc: there's a bunch of upload plugins, etc that will do a few methods
[04:28:45] <blackspotwiggins> but i can give you something i started from
[04:29:04] <dlmalloc> blackspotwiggins: that'd be great.
[04:29:09] <dlmalloc> misterm: I'll have a look. :)
[04:29:17] <dlmalloc> I was kinda hoping to write it myself, so I can learn.
[04:29:25] <blackspotwiggins> dlmalloc, https://code.google.com/p/jquery-html5-upload/source/browse/trunk/jquery.html5_upload.js
[04:29:34] <blackspotwiggins> line 140 and on
[04:29:55] <blackspotwiggins> you need to tweak further if you want multiple file support
[04:30:31] <dlmalloc> blackspotwiggins: Thanks, not interested in mutliple file support really.
[04:31:29] <blackspotwiggins> dlmalloc, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/FormData for formdata support
[04:31:46] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont have opera or ie to worry about, you're good
[04:32:40] <misterm> pfft, opera...we don't use those wimpy european browsers 'round here
[04:33:33] <dlmalloc> okay, I will look. :)
[04:37:10] <Dravekx> anyone have a clue why this isnt working? I'm not getting any errors:  http://pastebin.com/90nKkFE1

[04:38:22] <fotoflo> google you suck -- impossible to search for the jquery selector for "<select>"
[04:38:49] <Jayflux> can someone explain to me the ui stuff, i want to use the accordion but i usually just use the jQuery api
[04:38:50] <misterm> fotoflo: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[04:39:01] <Jayflux> do i need the ui core files just to use that?
[04:39:03] <Dravekx> Hi jay. lol
[04:39:25] <Jayflux> lol hey up
[04:40:09] <Jayflux> fotoflo: jQuery('select') ?
[04:40:10] <blackspotwiggins> Jayflux, select accordion in the custom jqueryui downloader, it chooses the correct bits
[04:40:21] <Jayflux> blackspotwiggins: ok I wil try that
[04:40:59] <fotoflo> ill just give it an ID i guess
[04:41:55] <fotoflo> but i want to know the events attached to <select>
[04:52:03] <Jayflux> fotoflo: jQuery('select') ?
[04:52:33] <fotoflo> $("#xxx").attr("selected", "selected");
[04:52:43] <fotoflo>  $("#xxx").change(function(){

[04:54:12] <silv3r_m00n> can files be send via ajax post query ?
[04:57:15] <anli__> silv3r_m00n: I also wonder that
[04:57:32] <anli__> I dont think you can do that however
[04:59:34] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: sure, why not? files are just data
[04:59:48] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: though obviously there's some restrictions
[05:00:15] <silv3r_m00n> misterm: like how ?
[05:01:13] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: read the file data, (probably) encode it, then post it
[05:01:14] <Dravekx> can I call a php function from inside an $.ajax URL ? ie. $j.ajax({  url: "<?php function(); ?>",
[05:01:36] <misterm> Dravekx: it depends on what you think that doesw
[05:01:39] <silv3r_m00n> misterm: and how to read file data ?
[05:01:47] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: with the file api
[05:01:55] <silv3r_m00n> link ?
[05:01:55] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: it's not available in all browsers

[05:02:02] <Dravekx> misterm the function calls a path
[05:02:12] <misterm> Dravekx: what do you mean "calls a path"
[05:02:17] <jedimind> question regarding jquery-mobile; i have a form i'm intercepting, and populating the DOM with some parsed HTML (results); problem is that i'm using <ul data-role="listview"> for the results, and not sure how to trigger jquery to capture the listview data-role and add it's additional classes, containers, etc
[05:02:24] <fotoflo> How very strange. My life is fucked…. all of a sudden this extension won't load at all!
[05:02:56] <misterm> Dravekx: let me put it this way, if the line you just posted is inside a .php file...and function() returns the url that you want to send the ajax request to, then yes it will work...otherwise no
[05:03:20] <misterm> Dravekx: and the said php file creates the .js file that you are running
[05:03:25] <Dravekx> $.ajax({ url: "<?php pathtofile("directorypath"); ?>/file.php" });
[05:03:27] <fotoflo> but it opens if i navigate to it and open it as a regular html file
[05:04:14] <Dravekx> ah cool
[05:04:19] <Dravekx> it 'should' work then
[05:05:03] <misterm> Dravekx: if you use a php file to generate the script, and the function returns a URL, yes
[05:08:40] <silv3r_m00n> misterm: which browsers support the html 5 file api ?
[05:09:16] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: the newer ones, I don't know the list offhand, sorry
[05:09:32] <silv3r_m00n> chrome , ff , IE8+  do these ones do ?
[05:09:43] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: if you need to do file uploads it's a reasonably well solved problem, there's plenty of plugins and such that will handle it for you
[05:10:23] <silv3r_m00n> misterm: I have a form , which I submit via ajax now can the file go into the same ajax request  ?
[05:10:32] <misterm> silv3r_m00n: you can probably find one that uses the file api and then falls back on other methods
[05:10:37] <cjheath> misterm: That was a question sorta out of the blue. Why ask me about keyboard shortcuts and menus?
[05:11:26] <misterm> cjheath: lol
[05:11:53] <misterm> cjheath: my IRC client has autocomplete for nicks, and in that case it was the wrong one
[05:12:10] <jedimind> is anyone familiar with  $.mobile.loadPage ? having a bit of an issue posting the results of a form post i'm hitting into the DOM
[05:12:45] <cjheath> aha. Ok. I did do a jquery.key JS module, but it's not really for shortcuts, which are pretty easy to do with simple JS
[05:13:45] <misterm> cjheath: ha, sounds cool

[05:16:56] <FlippZar> hi ! I have a problem with autocomplete in jQuery 1.8 here : http://jsfiddle.net/nGtYW/
[05:17:37] <FlippZar> my json array seems to be weel received but i cannot print an alert about the data received and consequently cannot populate the <input id>
[05:18:14] <xec> FlippZar: 1.6.2 is latest?
[05:18:46] <hariom> I am trying to create a horizontal sliding panel to show the messages server is sending. Server sends messages every 10 sec and user should check it he sees a red mark at the page top right corner. clicking on that red mark will have a horizontal slider.
[05:19:25] <crankharder> hey all.  I'm looking for a plugin that can do a cross fade effect betwen two elements.  What I don't need is an entire image slideshow plugin.  Know of anything that comes close to that?
[05:19:37] <xec> FlippZar: the JSON seems to be missing a closing ] bracket, is that just a typo?
[05:19:37] <hariom> Is there any plugin for that?
[05:20:30] <crankharder> hariom: presumably you have the whole "server sends" part solved by something?
[05:20:31] <silv3r_m00n> I have a form with 3 text fields and 1 file upload field , and I am submitting it via ajax , please suggest a plugin that can make the form work without any changes , but also upload the file as well
[05:21:13] <crankharder> silv3r_m00n: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#faq
[05:21:35] <hariom> crankhader: yes
[05:21:36] <FlippZar> xec yes it is
[05:22:03] <crankharder> hariom: and you can't just use slide() creatively?
[05:22:14] <FlippZar> sorry xec it's on jQuery 1.4.2 ..
[05:22:31] <silv3r_m00n> crankharder: thanks
[05:22:51] <hariom> crankharder: don't want to reinvent the wheel if there is already some good work done.
[05:25:16] <jedimind> can anyone help with $.mobile.loadPage ?
[05:25:25] <FlippZar> I've posted here xec : http://jsfiddle.net/nGtYW/1/
[05:28:55] <xec> FlippZar: i haven't used autocomplete plugin before, are you sure you can pass it a success handler directly?
[05:32:44] <FlippZar> xec what I want is to parse my JSON array but function parse is not called if I do : http://jsfiddle.net/nGtYW/2/
[05:32:53] <FlippZar> and I cannot understand why
[05:35:19] <misterm> FlippZar: have you checked if your request is error'ing out or anything?
[05:35:36] <xec> when/where exactly should the parse method get executed?
[05:35:53] <blackspotwiggins> FlippZar, im pretty sure you ant pass data/datatype to autocomplete
[05:35:58] <blackspotwiggins> and parse never gets executed as well
[05:36:25] <FlippZar> In Firebug it gets the good URL and gets the JSON array as I posted it
[05:36:46] <blackspotwiggins> and that means what exactly?
[05:37:17] <xec> FlippZar: i just had a look at http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete - i don't find any reference to "parse" option...
[05:38:22] <FlippZar> blackspotwiggins: it means the JSON object on http://jsfiddle.net/nGtYW/2/ with the names of the people
[05:38:30] <blackspotwiggins> ..
[05:38:32] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[05:38:45] <blackspotwiggins> but it doesnt mean that it calls a random function you pass to it
[05:40:44] <FlippZar> xec: I've seen the parse function here :http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1592048/jquery-autocomplete-with-json-response
[05:41:43] <FlippZar> blackspotwiggins: i thought that I can parse my JSON object to be well rendered in my input field
[05:42:17] <blackspotwiggins> notice how the functions are NOT named parse?
[05:42:27] <xec> FlippZar: well, that's in an object as second argument to .autocomplete()
[05:42:43] <blackspotwiggins> o shit, thats 2 years old..
[05:42:58] <blackspotwiggins> and about the old plugin
[05:43:19] <FlippZar> I have to admit that I'm lost now
[05:43:54] <misterm> FlippZar: unfortunately not everything on stack overflow is correct/up to date
[05:44:14] <misterm> FlippZar: your best bet to learn how to use the autocomplete plugin is the official page/up to date sources
[05:45:41] <kapowaz> anybody here used jQuery.validate to specify format rules?
[05:46:01] <Guest59079> kapowaz: yep
[05:46:20] <Guest59079> give me sec there is nice plugin for it
[05:47:02] <FlippZar> ok misterm i'm gonna try to find out where parse is as xec mentionned it
[05:47:03] <FlippZar> thx
[05:50:44] <Guest59079> kapowaz: check this http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/
[05:52:17] <xec> FlippZar: like i said, i never used autocomplete, but maybe the key is that you can supply a callback to the source option?
[05:53:03] <jedimind> hey, can anyone help me walk through a live search im doing, im looking to search as someone types into an input, but want to make sure they've stopped typing first, so want to put a timer on there, but i am having trouble working out the logic in stopping the timer / starting it again
[05:53:27] <kapowaz> Guest59079: yeah, I've been looking through all those. I actually see a good example in the marketo one.
[05:54:19] <xec> jedimind: have you checked out the autocomplete we were talking about? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete - the delay option allows what you want, i believe
[05:55:13] <jedimind> im not using jquery ui, so i need a standaloen function for the delay
[05:55:19] <jedimind> it's okay though i think i figured it out
[05:56:36] <jedimind> im ashamed to admit it, but stackoverflow actually helped me
[05:58:08] <misterm> Why would you be ashamed of that?
[05:58:18] <misterm> stackoverflow is awesome
[05:58:41] <misterm> and FSM bless the boys and girls who ask in IRC and stackoverflow instead of other random places
[05:59:16] <jedimind> i dont know, i suppose its because it's generally full of stupid people and no real answers from my experience
[05:59:22] <FlippZar> still stuck xec , i cannot find an example of the new autocomplete that works with JSON
[06:13:06] <whg> How do I get localized validation messages out of http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[06:26:23] <tauame> Hi, I'm using jquery-grid plugin, is there a way to put a link on each row of the grid?
[06:26:56] <tauame> I already saw their wiki, and didnt find anything about linking rows to another pages
[06:28:21] <anli__> I am trying to override show, but nothing will be shown now :)
[06:29:05] <anli__> http://pastebin.com/EdtMtHWQ
[06:29:35] <anli__> oh, can see an error
[06:30:04] <tauame> anyone here have any experience with jquery-grid?
[06:30:25] <anli__> Solved, I used attr incorrectly
[06:34:42] <AdvoWork> any reason why when animating an element. like changing its width. The parent dosent update till the animation is over ?
[06:35:04] <CodeGroove> Today is a special day today.
[06:37:21] <CodeGroove> It's Madonna's birthday today!!!
[06:38:20] <anli__> Must call her
[06:39:38] <seutje> damn, didn't know she could get any older
[06:40:20] * CodeGroove sleeps with Madonna records at night.
[06:46:11] <timing> CodeGroove: conclusion, your dick is so small it fits through the hole in the center
[06:47:47] <anli__> I will hide some <option>:s in a <select>, however, if I hide a selected option, I want it to be re-selected when if it will be show():n again, best approach for this?
[06:48:57] <d3c> gettext and jquery: what's best practice, to have one PO file containing text for the entire UI or to have a PO file for each UI page?
[06:49:48] <kborchers> anli__: you're going to have to rephrase that. not sure at all what you're trying to accomplish
[06:50:42] <yarco> hi i have a question about jQuery and CKEditor!
[06:51:01] <anli__> I have a <select> in which I sometimes want to .hide <option>:s
[06:51:24] <yarco> i have a div and it contains an textarea which use ckeditor, and a button
[06:51:28] <anli__> But if a .is('.selected') option is hidden, it seems to lose its selected attribute
[06:51:50] <anli__> oops, .is(':selected') that is
[06:52:02] <yarco> when click the button, the div would wrap a form using jQuery .wrap
[06:52:15] <yarco> and then submit the content
[06:52:36] <yarco> but the POST values returned by php show nothing
[06:53:01] <Segaja> anli__: when hiding a option remember if it was selected or not and check the remembered value when you restore / show the option again
[06:53:15] <CKIDOW> hi
[06:53:22] <CKIDOW> hi
[06:54:01] <CKIDOW> http://pastie.org/2380520 can someone please tell me why future added .level elements not triggering the hover effect here: http://pastie.org/2380520 ?
[06:54:12] <anli__> Segaja: I try to do that
[06:54:20] <kborchers> anli__: i don't think using hide on options is a good idea. i don't think it works well cross-browser. see ?detach
[06:54:21] <bot-t> anli__, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[06:54:22] <anli__> I post the code, please hold
[06:55:03] <anli__> http://pastebin.com/kpMMLgM7
[06:55:27] <anli__> kborchers: I have had no problems using .hide on options in either ff or ie
[06:55:41] <anli__> I can double check
[06:55:48] <kborchers> anli__: obviously you're having a problem though ;)
[06:56:21] <anli__> Yes, but I assume the problem is easily solved anyway
[06:56:30] <anli__> However, the pasted code was not the solution
[06:57:20] <yarco> my question : http://paste2.org/p/1589108
[06:58:21] <anli__> hm, hiding option did not fall out well in IE actually, I must have misunderstood
[06:58:27] <anli__> doh
[06:58:43] <kborchers> i didn't think it worked well in IE
[06:58:53] <anli__> Cant understand how they can do this to me
[06:58:58] <anli__> :)
[06:59:18] <anli__> .detach cant be a solution, because then I have to create new options
[06:59:37] <kborchers> use detach instead and store the detached elements, then use append, insertAfter, insertBefore or something similar to add them back in
[07:00:34] <anli__> kborchers: Hm, I will do a circumvention instead, but you surely give a correct solution
[07:01:24] <anli__> Wonder what the IE guys thought... "hm, we cannot approve hiding of <option>"
[07:04:45] <drwells> anybody know why focusout fires on radio buttons?
[07:04:49] <drwells> example here: http://jsfiddle.net/nMG4p/
[07:08:55] <CKIDOW> I got it thx anyway
[07:13:19] <kborchers> drwells: not sure what you mean. when focus leave the element, focusout is fired ... that is what i would expect
[07:13:44] <drwells> click the input box, then click the radio button.  It fires focus even though you are still focused on the div
[07:14:00] <drwells> I'm thinking something with change() has to be used to prevent this behavior
[07:15:50] <buttersb> hey guys, anyone got experience doing async google analytics?
[07:17:33] <cccaldas> guys
[07:17:42] <kborchers> drwells: the focusout only fires on the input elements, the div never receives focus and thus can not focusout. what you have done is bound to the focusout event on the div but that is only fired when the even bubbles up from one of the inputs inside. so both of those elements fire focusout, then when that reaches the div, it fires your handler
[07:18:11] <cccaldas> im having some problems with fadeIn and fadeOut, when i use sometimes the fadeIn stop about .5, .7 ..... can anyone helps me ?
[07:18:26] <kborchers> ?demo @ cccaldas
[07:18:26] <bot-t> cccaldas, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:18:36] <cccaldas> ok
[07:18:44] <cccaldas> pastebin...
[07:19:05] <kborchers> pastebin usually isn't as helpful since we can't see the problem happen
[07:19:26] <cccaldas> hmmm
[07:19:28] <drwells> kborchers: after the DIV is selected clicking the input does not fire focusout (it bubbles to the div).  The problem is that radio buttons do not bubble to the div.  Click the radio button, then the input box focus out doesn't fire.
[07:19:31] <cccaldas> ok
[07:19:35] <buttersb> ccaldas, I assume you are saying the animation isnt smooth, and the fadein occurs to soon sometimes?
[07:20:22] <buttersb> and yea, with animation, it's suggested you use a jsfiddle, because we wnat to see how your doing your animation. It is 'visual' after all.
[07:20:33] <kborchers> drwells: i think that is a browser difference ... it fires in IE9 but i don't see it in Chrome
[07:21:27] <drwells> kborchers: I tried ff6/chrome13 and got the same behavior.  What did IE9 do?
[07:21:52] <kborchers> it appends Focus out! when i click the radio then click the text input
[07:22:23] <kborchers> drwells: maybe if you explain the goal of this code, we can find a better way to do it cross-browser
[07:22:24] <drwells> hmm I think focusin/focusout need some more work then o.O
[07:23:17] <cccaldas> buttersb when i click quickly twice on button, that calls the fadeIn, and sometimes the fade stops on .5 or .7
[07:23:35] <drwells> I'm showing a box when you hover over an element.  If you select a form element (entering information), the box stays up until the inputs are deselected.
[07:24:24] <buttersb> you need to put the fadeIn as a callback
[07:24:29] <kborchers> drwells: i would hide your "box" in the blur event of the elements then
[07:24:34] <buttersb> as a callback to your fadeout
[07:25:06] <cccaldas> buttersb im using callback
[07:25:12] <buttersb> $('#element').fadeOut(500,function(e){ $(this).fadeIn()?})
[07:25:19] <buttersb> you are doing that?
[07:25:27] <cccaldas> yes
[07:25:46] <kborchers> drwells: so something like $("input").blur(function(e) { hide the box that is showing });
[07:25:47] <cccaldas> im doing fadeout on element and after fadeIn in another element
[07:25:48] <drwells> kborchers: okay, thanks
[07:25:59] <kborchers> np
[07:26:35] <buttersb> you can use the stop() method
[07:27:26] <buttersb> or you can use a .delay()
[07:27:37] <cccaldas> buttersb im doing this http://pastebin.com/e4g6nw8t
[07:28:00] <kborchers> cccaldas: what you should do is set a var that tracks when the animation is running. if not running, allow click to start the anim, otherwise don't and just update the var when the anim starts and ends
[07:28:03] <cccaldas> ops, i inserted the stop before fadeOut
[07:28:10] <cccaldas> well
[07:28:12] <buttersb> ...
[07:28:35] <cccaldas> kborchers im AS3 programmer, i thought this, but i didnt believe that can work
[07:28:45] <cccaldas> kborchers in AS3 i do that :)
[07:29:07] <buttersb> that would work i guess.
[07:29:10] <kborchers> or you don't even need to set a var
[07:29:14] <buttersb> i usually queue and dequeue
[07:29:20] <cccaldas> hmmm
[07:29:25] <cccaldas> queue....
[07:29:32] <cccaldas> i`ll google about queue
[07:29:52] <kborchers> you can use the :animated selector to check if the element is currently being animated and don't start it again if it is
[07:30:28] <cccaldas> hmm
[07:30:30] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[07:31:11] <cccaldas> kborchers thkx
[07:31:18] <cccaldas> i can fix it using fadeTo
[07:31:20] <cccaldas> 0 and 1
[07:31:29] <cccaldas> but i have to put display:none; manually
[07:31:30] <kborchers> so if(!$("animatingElement:animated").length){start the animation}
[07:32:37] <anli__> should be ".animatingElement:animated", right?
[07:32:43] <anli__> can be wrong
[07:32:44] <anli__> :)
[07:33:07] <anli__> But that will only work if there is one animating element
[07:34:35] <alaing> hi I am using jquery ui autocomplete and my drop down options contain html  eg. "<B>text</b> - example" when i click on the selection the textfield used that value. is there a way i can use a another value which does not contain the html. I have returned the value I would like to use but not sure how to populate the text field with it
[07:35:07] <cccaldas> buttersb kborchers i did fadeTo with css display:none manually after effect, and worked :)
[07:35:31] <kborchers> anli__: only need the . if it's a class ... i was just illustrating a solution. it will return the length so if more than one is animating it will still prevent it from starting
[07:36:01] <bjhaid> if i have multiple dialog boxes open and i need to pick elements in just one of the dialog(the dialog were triggered by the same event), how do i get that done?
[07:36:07] <anli__> got it
[07:36:14] <kborchers> cccaldas: cool, though that will always start the animation over. if that's ok, works for me
[07:37:42] <buttersb> yea, that's another method. Whatever works :)
[07:37:51] <buttersb> kborchers, you done any async google analytics?
[07:38:23] <kborchers> bjhaid: if you assign id's to your dialogs, you can still use those id's to get at the content of the dialog so $("#dialog1").dialog(); then $("#dialog").find("input") would give you all inputs in that single dialog
[07:39:00] <kborchers> buttersb: what do you mean, just adding the async code to your site to get stats in GA?
[07:39:04] <Nitrxgen> I wish CSS had selectors like jQuery does it
[07:39:27] <Nitrxgen> inb4 CSS 4
[07:39:29] <bjhaid> kborchers: the dialog are created dynamically, how would i determine that dynamically?
[07:39:37] <buttersb> well, just anything in particular regarding custom vars or things you think should be done by default, whether google reccomends them or not
[07:40:09] <kborchers> bjhaid: can you provide a link to your site or a fiddle to illustrate how you are creating your dialogs?
[07:41:07] <woozly|job> guys, how to select all elements with ID which starts with '_' undescope
[07:42:06] <bjhaid> kborchers: https://gist.github.com/1149238 (line 46)
[07:42:20] <kborchers> woozly|job: $("[id^='_']")
[07:42:28] <woozly|job> kborchers, ohh thanks!
[07:43:26] <kborchers> buttersb: not sure what you mean so probably not as involved in GA as you ;). i just add the code to the page then analyze my stats ... that's about it
[07:44:05] <anli__> woozly|job: Seems that those elements should belong to a class instead :)
[07:44:05] <bjhaid> kborchers: have you checked it up?
[07:44:23] <kborchers> bjhaid: patience is a virtue ;)
[07:44:37] <woozly|job> anli__, oh.. there only one element with one unique id ^)
[07:44:37] <bjhaid> of GODS (i know that, thanks)
[07:44:56] <woozly|job> oh, how to remove first character from id? :))
[07:45:06] <anli__> hehe
[07:45:30] <anli__> Why dont you give the element the right id to begin with...
[07:45:33] <anli__> :)
[07:45:35] <buttersb> kborchers, I have to do some async tracking, so few thigns i have to do diff, but no big deal
[07:45:51] <woozly|job> anli__, I can't... it has randomly hash :D
[07:46:08] <anli__> woozly|job: Is the ID random?
[07:46:20] <anli__> Ah, its auto generated?
[07:46:22] <woozly|job> yeah.. it is all dynamically generated
[07:46:25] <woozly|job> yeah)
[07:46:31] <anli__> Why do you need the id for something?
[07:46:31] <cccaldas> guys, i know this channel is for jquery, but anyone recomends xml + xslt for webpages ?
[07:46:33] <woozly|job> it's dynamic .js generated
[07:47:22] <anli__> ids is somthing I avoid as much as possible
[07:47:30] <anli__> Not to speak about auto generated ids :)
[07:48:13] <anli__> Assuming that auto generated ids starts with _ is in the other end of the tunnel
[07:49:01] <kborchers> bjhaid: hmmm, so you could add an id to the divs as they are created but the challenge is knowing which id is which dialog.
[07:49:24] <kborchers> what info are you trying to get out of the dialog?
[07:50:00] <bjhaid> kborchers: i am trying to allow my users make a query and get a pop-up of another dialog from the query
[07:50:03] <anli__> Keep the local scope that you had when you created a dialog, that is at least what I use to do
[07:50:38] <bjhaid> kborchers: it works, but the issue is when there are multiple dialogs it picks from the first dialog
[07:50:51] <woozly|job> guys, sorry about noobies questions, but, How to make slow background highlighting for an element?
[07:51:01] <kborchers> bjhaid: and you still need the first dialog? could you just replace the contents of the dialog with each subsequent query?
[07:51:08] <woozly|job> I meen slow Light on, and slow Light off (backgroundColor)
[07:52:08] <bjhaid> kborchers: i really have issues with replacing the content, since i aint pulling the div off a real 'html', they were all created in the script
[07:52:46] <kborchers> bjhaid: right but if you know there will be only one, you can give it an id that you know will always be the same then just update the content of the element with that id
[07:53:55] <kborchers> bjhaid: so you check to see if the dialog with that id exists, if not, create it, if it does, update content
[07:54:35] <adragos> Hi, I have a problem with draggable
[07:54:42] <adragos> I can't select text inside the boxes
[07:54:43] <adragos> :((
[07:55:56] <adragos> does anyone know how to fix?
[07:55:57] <timing> Hi
[07:56:10] <kborchers> adragos: easiest solution is to use a handle for dragging that is not in the text you want to be able to select. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ see the handle option
[07:56:11] <timing> my droppable doesn't accept anything from my draggable
[07:56:22] <timing> I don't use accept or any other option
[07:56:33] <timing> what can I do to debug?
[07:57:40] <adragos> kborchers: the handle is not in the text. the handle is a top-bar, like in windows programs
[07:57:50] <adragos> dragging/dropping works perfectly
[07:57:54] <adragos> but I cannot select any text
[07:58:43] <kborchers> where is that stupid bot when you need him :(
[07:59:09] <kborchers> adragos: please create a http://jsfiddle.net of your problem or provide a link to your site
[08:00:23] <bjhaid> kborchers: please have a look @ my code again, i get the query on line 13, just wondering how to replace the content of the dialog in line 13 with the content of dialog in line 35
[08:01:07] <adragos> kborchers: http://themeforest.net/item/profi-admin-administration-for-the-professionals/full_screen_preview/49058
[08:01:15] <adragos> this is the theme I'm working on
[08:02:02] <adragos> I bought it as is on the site, and currently implemented it into my own application
[08:02:42] <adragos> http://themeforest.net/item/profi-admin-administration-for-the-professionals/full_screen_preview/49058
[08:05:37] <alaing> hi I am using jquery ui autocomplete and my drop down options contain html  eg. "<B>text</b> - example" when i click on the selection the textfield used that value. is there a way i can use a another value which does not contain the html. I have returned the value I would like to use but not sure how to populate the text field with it
[08:05:55] <kborchers> bjhaid: sorry, boss called
[08:06:18] <dr0id> that theme sucks bro
[08:06:53] <bjhaid> no problems
[08:07:37] <adragos> dr0id why do you say so
[08:07:46] <adragos> it's a perfect admin panel theme
[08:07:50] <adragos> as a base
[08:07:55] <adragos> works great
[08:07:56] <kborchers> bjhaid: line 13 $("<div id='dialog'>").html(.....  then on line 46, if($("#dialog").length) { $("#dialog").html(g);} else { $("#dialog").html(g)..... }
[08:07:57] <dr0id> sucks IMO, there were better ones
[08:07:59] <kborchers> something like that
[08:08:01] <dr0id> a/were/are
[08:08:06] <dr0id> for example. Adminus
[08:09:11] <bjhaid> kborchers: need to step out, would have a look @ it, and probably check back here tomorrow if i have issues
[08:09:12] <bjhaid> thanks
[08:09:29] <kborchers> np, i'll be in and out tomorrow but should be around
[08:10:04] <adragos> dr0id: I like the design of Adminus... but unfortunately it's too wide
[08:10:13] <adragos> uses too much space
[08:10:18] <adragos> need it more compact
[08:10:54] <adragos> need to be able to admin the site fast... whereas adminus, has pages the size of the Sears Towers
[08:10:55] <drwells> test
[08:11:02] <adragos> takes forever to work with it
[08:11:28] <kborchers> drwells: test failed ;)
[08:11:48] <drwells> kborchers: but succeeded for you!
[08:11:53] <kborchers> heh
[08:15:31] <Rushing[away]> man, this 1.6.2 + IE + WinXP issue is a bummer...anyone else run into this?
[08:15:54] <Rushing[away]> basically just shuts the page down and they get the "this tab has been recovered" message
[08:16:18] <Rushing[away]> just got a report from a second client that this is happening on their site
[08:19:45] <redfox> hi. is there an event handler which i can use to track changes of the content of a div element?
[08:20:13] <Jakey> wtf?
[08:20:20] * Jakey kicks JakeyChan
[08:20:24] <JakeyChan> how to select sub children with parent ?
[08:20:27] <JakeyChan> :D
[08:20:30] <fris> redfox what kind of changes?
[08:20:34] <JakeyChan> Jakey, jackey
[08:20:34] <drwells> redfox: nothing crossbrowser
[08:20:46] <JakeyChan> Jakeychan
[08:20:50] <JakeyChan> :D
[08:21:22] <kborchers> JakeyChan: $("element").children().andSelf()
[08:21:39] <JakeyChan> thanks
[08:21:42] <redfox> fris: another script changes html() of a div element, i want to react on this (lets assume i cannot change the other script)
[08:21:45] <JakeyChan> kborchers: :)
[08:21:48] <kborchers> np
[08:22:24] <drwells> redfox: you should look into custom events, you can communicate those changes via event after contents changed
[08:23:39] <oquidave_> hello guys,
[08:25:07] <redfox> to be more specific: i use jQueryUI's tabs() for a div container. the problem is that another script changes the content of this div container when i click on a link (magento configurable product). because of some reason, it cannot change content which is inside of tabs() containers, thus i try to hav a container outside of tabs() and copy the content when it gets changed.
[08:25:09] <JakeyChan> how to select that not contains class name, like $('div:not-contains(class="class-name")')
[08:25:57] <Rushing[away]> $("div:not(.class-name)")
[08:25:58] <jedimind_> hrm, does .change() work for text inputs as well? or only selects
[08:26:06] <redfox> s/this div/a child/
[08:26:16] <Rushing[away]> yes it works for text, textarea, select, radio, checkbox
[08:26:20] <Rushing[away]> basically just not hidden fields
[08:28:04] <Rushing[away]> redfox, there's no event for when a div's html is changed
[08:28:14] <oquidave_> hello am trying to get checked elements from a form using jquery...i need some help ...here is my code thanks....http://pastebin.com/4teQv1cN
[08:28:16] <Rushing[away]> you'd have to setup an interval and test it
[08:28:44] <redfox> any other idea why prototype is unable to change the content of tabs()- child divs?
[08:29:18] <Rushing[away]> well, you definitely can change the content, if it's in the DOM
[08:29:51] <Rushing[away]> so you may need to look at your selectors, or see if prototype is doing something silly like resetting the html each time a tab is viewed
[08:30:46] <Rushing[away]> oquidave_, try ("*:checkbox:checked")
[08:32:45] <redfox> ok, nevermind. just found out thats its not a jquery regarded problem. thanks anyway :)
[08:42:33] <DarsVaeda> hi, can someone recommend a script that allows me to order a list via drag and drop?
[08:42:43] <murugaratham> anyone know of a generic file viewer similar to autovue?
[08:42:45] <danzik17> Is there a way to pass a map of data to an ajax request (not from the response) that'll be passed along for anything calling .done on the returned promise?
[08:42:59] <DarsVaeda> i found "simple tree plugin" but that is rather old and not maintained seemingly
[08:43:43] <caleywoods> Question: When calling .select() is the text selected placed into something I can access? I'm looking to have a textarea where when you highlight a URL it shortens it. I have all the code working except needing to pass what was highlighted to the shorten method.
[08:43:46] <danzik17> DarsVaeda: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/, http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[08:45:39] <oquidave_> Rushing[away, thanks but what does the asterisk(*) mean?
[08:47:09] <danzik17> oquidave_: It means an element of any type (and it's horribly inefficient)
[08:47:57] <oquidave_> danzik17, true, but when i try to put a filter or specify the div or element like form, it does not work
[08:48:53] <oquidave_> danzik17, something like $("form:checkbox:checked")
[08:49:15] <murugaratham> anyone know of a generic file viewer like autovue tt's oss?
[08:50:03] <danzik17>  oquidave_: That's because that won't work, the form doesn't have a checked prop, the inputs do.  Try $('#form').find('input:checked')
[08:52:12] <oquidave_> danzik17, thanks but that has not worked
[08:52:41] <EdwardIII> hrm
[08:52:42] <danzik17> oquidave_: Do you have a jsfiddle testcase?
[08:53:05] <seutje> oquidave_: $('form input:checkbox:checked') might work a lil better
[08:54:19] <oquidave_> danzik17, that worked, thanks
[08:54:37] <oquidave_> seutje, that worked, thanks
[08:55:12] <EdwardIII> i've got an array coming back using JSON - i wanna fade through 'em, kind of like a sexy version of a ticker
[08:55:31] <oquidave_> danzik17, am not quite sure of jsfiddle testcase since am new to the channel and jquery itself
[08:55:34] <EdwardIII> how would i look about doing that? some kind of timeout that keeps calling the callback inside my .getJSON?
[08:56:04] <littulb> im getting these error messages in firebug jQuery16208961268720119328_1313509721343 is not a function
[08:56:11] <littulb> dows that look familiar to anyone?
[08:56:22] <littulb> does*
[08:56:30] <EdwardIII> not sure what the right keywords are
[09:01:29] <sahilsk> hi all
[09:01:59] <sahilsk> can anyone give me a brief idea about the working of this size? http://www.fullsix.it/
[09:02:08] <sahilsk> the way it filter content
[09:02:30] <pamelafoxx> Anyone know what's up with JS errors in Chrome always getting reported as coming from "d.d.extend._Deferred.f.resolveWith" when using jQuery?
[09:03:22] <danzik17> pamelafoxx:  Let's see if I guess right: v1.5.1?
[09:03:36] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: pamela!
[09:04:12] <pamelafoxx> yep
[09:04:31] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano heyaz :)
[09:04:42] <danzik17> pamelafoxx:  Upgrade to 1.5.2+ It's a bug that was fixed (ran into the same issue)
[09:04:55] <ajpiano> how ya doin?
[09:05:11] <ajpiano> yea don'tcha be 1.5.1in
[09:05:13] <ralphholzmann> oh hai pamelafoxx
[09:05:14] <pamelafoxx> ah awesome. thatll make debugging 100x easier.
[09:05:46] <littulb> im getting this message in firebug...jQuery16208961268720119328_1313509721343 is not a function - any ideas?
[09:06:04] <SlexAxton> sounds like a jsonp error
[09:06:08] <SlexAxton> yes?
[09:06:20] <ralphholzmann> yeah
[09:06:27] <ralphholzmann> trying to call a generated callback that doesn't exist ?
[09:06:34] <pamelafoxx> is it better to get 1.5.2 or 1.6.* ?
[09:06:45] <ajpiano> 1.6.2
[09:07:01] <hun7er> hello
[09:08:41] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: btw what are you phonegappin' ... i was up till 5am last night wrangling that shit
[09:09:18] <hun7er> I've got a problem with jQuery draggable and sortable with an example, can anyone help?
[09:09:31] <FLX11> hey guys, I created the following plugin: http://pastebin.com/Rqs5nA7w
[09:09:58] <kborchers> ?ask @ hun7er
[09:09:59] <bot-t> hun7er, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:10:06] <FLX11> it currently works on DOM elements (chaining) but I'd like to use it standalone (without DOM element) as well
[09:10:10] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano an app i've been working on, a social nutrition tracking thing. i think im figuring out the phonegap thing - once i get auth worked out, should work well. luckily theres a facebookauth phonegap plugin, as thats the part i was worried about.
[09:10:12] <FLX11> how can I achieve this?
[09:10:35] <hun7er> ok, sorry ;) http://hun7er.pl/poligon/dragndrop/menu/ - here's the example of what I'm going to talk about
[09:10:55] <ajpiano> heh i'm working on similar, dealing with persisting auth from rails
[09:10:57] <hun7er> I can drag those buttons from the top but I can't modify the input (text) content
[09:11:13] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: are you targetting droid or just ios
[09:11:20] <ajpiano> or just droid*
[09:11:21] <ajpiano> :p
[09:11:35] <ajpiano> or just symbian, what do i know
[09:11:46] <kborchers> hun7er: what browser, seems to work though hard to drag in Chrome
[09:11:52] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano phonegap seems great but itd be nice for more real-world examples of the right architecture, like with user auth. im just targeting droid for now.
[09:11:57] <hun7er> firefox
[09:12:12] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano i dont have an iphone so i couldnt generate a signing key even if i wanted to.
[09:12:20] <hun7er> yes, it works quite hard but the problem is with modifying the button content mostly
[09:12:21] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: i agree... i was wrangling project structure all night last night
[09:12:36] <squeakytoy> Hey all. IS it possible to trigger a jquery dialog, with only using javascript? i mean, even the html context?
[09:12:51] <hun7er> because it's posted to a hidden input giving me the opportunity of sending it via post method
[09:13:01] <hun7er> it's sent*, my bad
[09:13:01] <kborchers> hun7er: i can modify content in FF, just can't select it
[09:13:10] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx the ios sim isn't bad though... droid is untenable.   this might be useful though for ya
[09:13:17] <ajpiano> http://www.senchatouchbits.com/8/organizing-files-within-phonegap-projects.html
[09:13:27] <hun7er> yep, but the problem isn't with just modifying the content
[09:13:43] <hun7er> firefox shows me that it doesn't change at all
[09:13:47] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano yesterday i was jus connecting my droid via USB and was pleasantly surprised at how fast it is to run. and im catting the logs out to my terminal.
[09:13:51] <hun7er> despite the fact it seems to change :|
[09:14:10] <hun7er> firebug* not firefox.
[09:14:13] <ajpiano> yeah, i just got a nexus one for testing this app :)
[09:14:29] <kborchers> hun7er: hmm, i see. let me play with it for a min
[09:14:48] <hun7er> ok, no problem, thanks :)
[09:14:53] <danzik17> Is there a better way of extending the returnd data from an ajax call then resolving an additional deferred (http://pastebin.com/4G2wcgLX)?  It just seems like there should be an easier way
[09:20:13] <Ogredude> hey what's the best practice way of hiding DOM elements in the rendered document, so that you can fadeIn() or show() them later?
[09:20:34] <Ogredude> I've been using a 'hidden' CSS class, but that's screwing with my acceptance tests, so I'm looking for an alternative
[09:24:06] <kborchers> hun7er: that is weird, i am not sure what is causing that
[09:24:27] <kborchers> Ogredude: display:none or $("element").hide();
[09:25:45] <Ogredude> kborchers:  so do you suggest a style= attribute on the element?  I've been using a CSS class 'hidden' but that's interfering with my acceptance testing.  I don't want to FOUS by using JQuery to hide it.  These are elements that need to start out hidden, so that JQuery can expose them when the interaction calls for it.
[09:26:08] <Ogredude> s/FOUS/FOUC/
[09:26:09] <littulb> im getting this message in firebug...jQuery16208961268720119328_1313509721343 is not a function - any ideas?
[09:26:27] <kborchers> Ogredude: what's wrong with using display:none in your "hidden" class?
[09:26:39] <kborchers> acceptance testing?
[09:28:10] <johnline3> .css('opacity':'1','height':'5px');
[09:28:17] <johnline3> is this line correct
[09:28:35] <johnline3> im not sure how to array several css statements
[09:28:56] <hun7er> kborchers: neither am I, that's the problem :/
[09:28:59] <kborchers> johnline3: no, .css({'opacity':'1','height':'5px'});
[09:29:18] <hun7er> but thanks for trying
[09:29:30] <Ogredude> well I can't seem to get RSpec/Capybara to give me a straight answer on whether an element is hidden or visible.
[09:30:04] <johnline3> ah yes, thankyou kborchers
[09:30:56] <Ogredude> kborchers:  does jquery assign a css class to stuff it hides?
[09:31:09] <kborchers> no, it just sets it display: none
[09:32:10] <Ogredude> ah, I think I see a way around this
[09:33:42] <hun7er> kborchers: I guess there's no easy way to make it work properly?
[09:33:51] <hun7er> I mean, making it the other way
[09:33:55] <hun7er> doing it*
[09:34:09] <kborchers> hun7er: not sure, sorry :/
[09:34:31] <hun7er> np, thanks though
[09:34:51] <danzik17> hun7er - You could always just clobber jQuery's hide/show functions with your own implementation that just add/remove your class I guess
[09:35:20] <danheberden> don't clobber - if you have to do that, make your own
[09:35:31] <danheberden> better yet, just add/remove the appropriate classes
[09:35:36] <danheberden> http://vimeo.com/26844734
[09:36:17] <danzik17> danheberden, +1 - just suggesting a way to get it working with .show/.hide if it was really necessary for some reason
[09:37:39] <Ogredude> oh ffs.  It's suddenly decided to work the way it says in the documentation.
[09:37:43] <Ogredude> it wasn't doing this yesterday
[09:38:14] <MatthiasVance> I'm using $(document.body).click(), and I have a document with a <span> and a <p>, whenever I click the span and the browser is not ie6-9 or firefox, it returns the HTMLElement instead of the HTMLSpanElement for e.target
[09:39:23] <hun7er> clobbering the hide/show functions to make jquery change the input value? sorry but I don't understand the idea
[09:40:16] <MatthiasVance> never mind, I have a cleaner way of doing this =)
[09:41:00] <Ogredude> hot damn it works
[09:57:09] <Ogredude> http://d.pr/Fhds <-- He says all tests pass.  Yay!
[10:02:46] <jeffsmykil> Is foo the .val of this?  <xml>foo</xml>
[10:02:53] <jeffsmykil> or the text
[10:04:29] <jeffsmykil> or something else entirely
[10:04:30] <sinneD> can someone please be so kind and answer my question? :)
[10:04:50] <jeffsmykil> oh its text
[10:04:57] <jeffsmykil> i answered my own question
[10:05:11] <sinneD> hey guys, I created the following plugin: http://pastebin.com/Rqs5nA7w
[10:05:18] <sinneD> it currently works on DOM elements (chaining) but I'd like to use it standalone (without DOM element) as well
[10:05:25] <sinneD> how can I achieve this?
[10:05:43] <jeffsmykil> I barely saw that go over my head, sorry
[10:08:35] <Ogredude> sinneD:  sorry bud, that one's way over my head too
[10:08:54] <sinneD> that's ok Ogredude :) hopefully someone knows
[10:09:09] <monokrome> What was the question?
[10:09:24] <jeffsmykil> people know
[10:09:31] <sinneD> using a function as chain in a DOM element and standalone
[10:09:31] <jeffsmykil> they might just be at lunch
[10:09:40] <sinneD> I know one plugin that does do both: http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/
[10:09:49] <sinneD> code: https://simplemodal.googlecode.com/files/jquery.simplemodal-1.4.1.js
[10:10:19] <sinneD> but I'm still not sure what enabled that you can use myFunction(); and $(#bla).myFunction();
[10:10:50] <OvidiuB> hello
[10:11:22] <OvidiuB> can someone guide me how to use cookies with jquery tabs ?
[10:11:36] * monokrome still doesn't understand what sinneD is trying to do
[10:12:49] <ajpiano> sinneD: what you basically do is
[10:12:52] <sinneD> monokrome: I want to use a function as part of a DOM element ($(#bla).myFunction();), but I also want to use it without specifying a DOM element (myFunction();)
[10:13:06] <ajpiano> you have a constructor that returns a new instance and accepts an object of options
[10:13:18] <ajpiano> and then your plugin is a wrapper around the constructor
[10:13:29] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i'm using load() for my tabs, and sometimes one tab takes a while to load, so if i load another tab while the 1st load is still pending, all is well, until the 1st load completes and replaces the html.  Is there a way to cancel a specific ajax query?
[10:13:51] <ajpiano> sinneD: essentially, something like this https://github.com/ajpiano/jquery-boilerplate/blob/widget-lite/jquery.boilerplate.js
[10:13:54] <MoTiOnXml> would like to find input (of type text) that are not empty: find(".itemList input:not(:empty)")
[10:13:57] <monokrome> if (this == window) { } ?
[10:14:01] <MoTiOnXml> i suspect i should be using has() instead
[10:14:09] <MoTiOnXml> has(:value) or something
[10:14:14] <monokrome> sinneD: ^
[10:14:23] <ajpiano> sinneD: what you could also do is something like monokrome is suggesting, whihc is that it just magically works on an empty collection
[10:14:39] <sinneD> thanks guys!
[10:14:44] <ajpiano> like var collection = this.length ? this : $("<div>");  return collection.each(function() { });
[10:14:45] <sinneD> how would you implement : if (this == window) { } ?
[10:15:24] <afilina-org> Hi folks.
[10:15:51] <MoTiOnXml> what's wrong with this? find(".itemList input:not(:empty)") :)
[10:16:00] <MoTiOnXml> give me all inputs not empty
[10:16:18] <MoTiOnXml> although jQuery says "no, can't do"
[10:16:18] <monokrome> sinneD: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/459465/
[10:16:26] <RoosterJuice_> how do you guys do photo galleries?  Do you have an actual picture, or do you just do light box?
[10:16:32] <monokrome> probably close to that, but I'm not 100% positive that I did it right.
[10:16:41] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml Description: Select all elements that have no children (including text nodes).
[10:16:47] <afilina-org> Am i the only one going nuts over "dblclick" no longer working since Chrome 13?
[10:17:31] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: for :empty?
[10:17:33] <jrockjiggz> MoTiOnXml: find(".itemList").not(":empty")
[10:17:52] <MoTiOnXml> no, i want the input fields
[10:18:09] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml: i think you should do find(".itemList input").not(function() { return !$(this).val();  });
[10:18:10] <ajpiano> right
[10:18:17] <ajpiano> you want input fields whose value is empty
[10:18:19] <MoTiOnXml> right, but shorter
[10:18:21] <ajpiano> which isn't what :empty does
[10:18:26] <ajpiano> right, but actually working
[10:18:27] <jrockjiggz> can anyone help on my question? delayed load request replaces newer html?
[10:18:32] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: i want those who isn't empty
[10:18:33] <monokrome> sinneD: You could also use a factory to get a function… http://paste.pocoo.org/show/459467/
[10:18:42] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml: that's what my code does
[10:18:46] <monokrome> (which I think is closer to what ajpiano was suggesting)
[10:18:57] <MoTiOnXml> isn't there a shorter syntax for that?
[10:19:03] <monokrome> Probably :)
[10:19:15] <ajpiano> what difference does it make
[10:19:21] <MoTiOnXml> just learning
[10:19:24] <ajpiano> well
[10:19:24] <sinneD> ajpiano: I tried the boilerplate, but when trying to invoke it standalone (without a DOM element), it doesnt work: $.plugin is not a function
[10:19:29] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: thanks
[10:19:52] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml: you can try with [value!=''] but i would consider that a way worse approach
[10:20:02] <monokrome> sinneD: Actually, this one's better because it just assumes you're passing the context through apply if you don't provide 'e' http://paste.pocoo.org/show/459468/
[10:20:12] <ajpiano> sinneD: i never really tested that code, it's sort of just a retort to some guy who forced me to show some code
[10:20:14] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: agree, just think i've seen a shorter way previously - using has()
[10:20:15] <ajpiano> the basic pattern should work though
[10:20:22] <MoTiOnXml> like has(:value) or something
[10:20:25] <kborchers> ajpiano: i started writing it that way but it won't work for textarea or select will it
[10:20:38] <ajpiano> kborchers: it should
[10:20:46] <monokrome> except undefined should be a string… I need some coffee to wake up. :|
[10:20:48] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml: :has, again, deals with child contents, not value
[10:21:23] <sinneD> I see ajpiano, thanks
[10:21:32] <sinneD> monokrome: how would you invoke that function?
[10:21:45] <sinneD> it's not some_function_factory()
[10:22:09] <sinneD> sorry for being oblivious
[10:22:16] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: noted, and thanks
[10:22:34] <monokrome> sinneD: To make the jQuery function, jQuery.fn.some_function = some_function_factory()
[10:23:07] <monokrome> to make it use another element globally (this example uses document.body), var some_function = some_function_factory(document.body)
[10:23:09] <ajpiano> monokrome: i don't think that'd work
[10:23:28] <sinneD> monokrome: can you maybe help me to fix my code: http://pastebin.com/Rqs5nA7w
[10:23:31] <kborchers> ajpiano: hmmm, is that because attr would still pull the value prop or am i just confused? didn't know textarea had a value attr.
[10:23:33] <ajpiano> at least not in terms of defining the .fn
[10:23:39] <monokrome> ajpiano: With this? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/459468/
[10:23:48] <ajpiano> kborchers: textareas are specialcased through .val() too
[10:23:52] <ajpiano> oh you mean the selector?
[10:23:57] <kborchers> yes the selector
[10:23:59] <ajpiano> i don't know if th selector would work, that's why i wouldn't use it
[10:24:01] <ajpiano> :D
[10:24:07] <kborchers> that's what i was getting at ;)
[10:24:10] <ajpiano> filtering by val is way more explicit
[10:24:13] <kborchers> right
[10:24:23] <jeffsmykil> <fooXMLData></fooXMLData>
[10:24:26] <jeffsmykil> how do i get at that?
[10:24:30] <jeffsmykil> the actual name of the node
[10:24:35] <jeffsmykil> val and text dont do it
[10:24:45] <ajpiano> monokrome, yeah
[10:25:37] <sinneD> monokrome, I still get $.some_function is not a function
[10:25:56] <ajpiano> sinneD, the some_function is not attached to jQuery
[10:26:14] <ajpiano> sinneD: if you take the boilerplate thing i linked
[10:26:20] <sinneD> it should be when jQuery.fn.some_function = some_function_factory() ?
[10:26:24] <ajpiano> and make it so the Plugin constructor is actually $.Plugin
[10:26:28] <ajpiano> then you will get both styles
[10:26:36] <ajpiano> and you'd do new $.Plugin(element)
[10:26:42] <monokrome> ajpiano: It works
[10:26:44] <ajpiano> or $("elems").plugin();
[10:27:19] <sinneD> ajpiano: I don't want $.Plugin(element), I want $.Plugin(options)
[10:27:19] <BillCriswell> This might seem like a weird request... but is there any way to detect when a CSS property is changed? I have some script that I can't edit that's making a table display: inline and I'm learning that's not good. I'd like to detect if changes to display: inline then change it to display: table;... Any idea how to accomplish this?
[10:27:30] <monokrome> the only difference is that my_element needs to be an array to match jQuery's 'this'
[10:27:32] <sinneD> and  $("elems").plugin(options);
[10:27:37] <monokrome> ajpiano: http://d.pr/HZ1L
[10:27:39] <ajpiano> monokrome: except that now you have to continue to special-case it all the way down, because now sometimes my_element is a DOM element and sometimes a jquery
[10:27:45] <ajpiano> sinneD: you can make it work however you want
[10:27:53] <ajpiano> sinneD: as you might have guessed there isn't  "a right answer" here
[10:28:01] <ajpiano> it's just a question of how you want to organise the code and the arguments
[10:28:05] <sinneD> sorry for being a bit of an ass, but I'm just a bit out of my depth :)
[10:28:34] <sinneD> just asking very basically, what would I need to change on the boilerplate to have this work?
[10:28:35] <sinneD> https://raw.github.com/ajpiano/jquery-boilerplate/widget-lite/jquery.boilerplate.js
[10:28:41] <sinneD> I can work out the rest myself
[10:29:11] <monokrome> ajpiano: I never said it was a perfect solution! I was just hoping it might have been a good start. :)
[10:29:18] <ajpiano> ok :)
[10:29:21] <ajpiano> sinneD: give me a sec
[10:29:29] <sinneD> much obliged guys ^_^
[10:29:33] <jeffsmykil> anyone?  <fooXMLnode>bar</fooXMLnode>   .text == bar how do you get fooXMLnod?
[10:30:22] <ajpiano> sinneD:  so you'd want to pass in {element: whatever} to the constructor?
[10:30:36] <ajpiano> jeffsmykill tagName ?
[10:30:52] <jeffsmykil> so .tagName();  ?
[10:30:58] <ajpiano> no elem.tagName
[10:31:12] <ajpiano> it's a property of the native elem, not a jquery method
[10:31:27] <sinneD> ajpiano: I basically want it to work with $("elems").plugin(options); and $.plugin(options);
[10:31:31] <ajpiano> right
[10:31:38] <sinneD> as sometimes I'll have to do something against an element
[10:31:38] <thefalling> Is there a way i can have a floating scrollbar for my div, so if they can see the div, it will show a scrollbar on the bottom of their screen, rather than them having to scroll to the bottom of the page to scroll left/right?
[10:31:44] <ajpiano> but where does the element that it uses come from if you're just constructing it
[10:31:49] <ajpiano> where does it load that html 2
[10:32:05] <ananta> hi
[10:32:21] <sinneD> it uses the html and loads on doc ready
[10:32:37] <ajpiano> what do you mean "the html"
[10:32:44] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano I am dumb, you know this:
[10:32:45] <jeffsmykil> var numberOfAreasArray = $(this).find("#" + selectedFacility + " floor[level='" + selectedFloor + "'] areas").children().map(function() {return $(this).tagName(); }).get();
[10:32:57] <sinneD> sometimes I need it to retrieve info via ajax and display it in an element, but other times I just want it to do an ajax request without updating any element
[10:32:57] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: return this.tagName
[10:33:18] <jeffsmykil> nothing
[10:33:26] <ananta> how to use sortable function for table rows in jquery
[10:34:00] <jeffsmykil> is tagName an actual thing or are you telling me to put the name something in there
[10:34:07] <ananta> please any one give my answer
[10:34:08] <sinneD> ajpiano: does that make sense
[10:34:57] <ajpiano> sinneD: quasi
[10:35:04] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: it's an actual thing
[10:35:09] <ananta> is the sortable function used in static way in jquery
[10:35:18] <sinneD> ajpiano: I'm writing a google tasks app
[10:35:25] <sinneD> and sometimes it needs to retrieve tasks
[10:35:34] <sinneD> and other times it should just update the current value
[10:35:39] <ajpiano> ananta: jquery ui sortable doesn't work on table rows
[10:36:05] <ajpiano> sinneD: i get that.  i'm just saying, it doesn't make sense to have this giantic constructor and infrastructure when what you really need is just an abstraction around the ajax call itself, so far as i can tell
[10:36:43] <sinneD> ajpiano: you mean the abstraction around my code or around the boilerplate?
[10:36:45] <ananta> what is the alternative solution for sorting table rows
[10:36:52] <jrockjiggz> how can i stop a previous ajax request as a newer one has been called
[10:37:05] <jeffsmykil> isnt there a table sorter plugin anata?
[10:37:08] <jrockjiggz> async: false; seems to lock the browser
[10:37:09] <jeffsmykil> in jquery ui
[10:37:17] <ajpiano> sinneD: around your code
[10:37:41] <sinneD> I dunno man, I've based my work on tutorials I read written by John Resig
[10:37:43] <ajpiano> jrockjiggz: keep a queue of the ajax requests and in beforeSend of each ajax call check the queue and stop any xhrs that are pending
[10:37:44] <kborchers> jrockjiggz: if you set var xhr = $.ajax.... then you can do xhr.abort(); I believe
[10:38:02] <ajpiano> sinneD: right, and?
[10:38:15] <sinneD> ajpiano: that was in the example code :D
[10:38:42] <ajpiano> i don't think john would agree that every single piece of code he's written is a good starting point for every possible implementation
[10:38:48] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano, kborchers: thanks awesome stuff
[10:39:02] <jrockjiggz> jQuery.xhr is wicked
[10:39:34] <sinneD> ajpiano: I can see that
[10:39:58] <ananta> can we use both static and dynamaic datas in sortable function in jqueries
[10:40:05] <ajpiano> sinneD: so far as I can tell, you'd be much better served by having a function just wrap and return your ajax call
[10:40:37] <ajpiano> and then your plugin should just call that function and inject the html it got back into the element
[10:41:05] <sinneD> like, creating a function and making the argument of an element optional?
[10:41:16] <sinneD> I would lose my chaining, but I can live with that
[10:41:17] <ajpiano> i'll show you i hope
[10:41:20] <ajpiano> you won't lose chaining
[10:41:33] <sinneD> ajpiano: thank you for your infinite patience :)
[10:41:40] <ajpiano> the point is that the "plugin" is a really thin layer around "iterating over elements and calling some other piece of functionality on them"
[10:41:42] <ajpiano> not "all your logic"
[10:43:33] <ajpiano> also jquery will do a lot of the work you're doing here for you
[10:43:41] <ajpiano> in $.ajax by default
[10:43:51] <ajpiano> so most of this if stuff is going to go away
[10:43:54] <ajpiano> just give a few
[10:44:11] <sinneD> awesome, thanks ajpiano
[10:46:32] <Dirkos> What is the best way to catch the "paste" event since: jQuery(document).bind('paste', function(e){}) wont work in IE678
[10:50:12] <adragos> help. I have problems with draggable
[10:50:23] <adragos> I cannot select text inside draggable divs
[10:51:11] <sinneD> adragos: what are you currently using?
[10:51:27] <adragos> ?
[10:51:32] <adragos> jquery
[10:51:37] <adragos> latest version
[10:51:48] <sinneD> no, do you use any event binder with it?
[10:54:29] <sinneD> ajpiano: unfortunately I have to leave in 10 minutes
[10:54:59] <ajpiano> sinneD
[10:55:01] <ajpiano> i'm about to post my thing
[10:55:24] <sinneD> that's ok, thanks a lot
[10:55:30] <ajpiano> sinneD http://jsfiddle.net/7qhVb/
[10:55:35] <ajpiano> can't guarantee it works as is
[10:55:39] <ajpiano> but it shows the approach of like
[10:55:44] <ajpiano> separating the ajax part from the plugin part
[10:56:06] <ajpiano> what you need to know about it is is a) jquery ajax deals with building a query string for you, you can just pass an object to data:
[10:56:32] <ajpiano> b) ajax returns an observable object that you can attach callbacks to using .then() and those callbacks will be fired similar to the success callback
[10:56:37] <OvidiuB> can someone help me add cookie for tabs ? this is the code for the current working tabs: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/459488/
[10:56:39] <ajpiano> ie, when the async action is complete
[10:57:01] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/7qhVb/1/ even*
[10:58:31] <sinneD> ajpiano: when I use $.tasks({'action' : 'update'}); it still says $.tasks is not a function
[10:58:37] <sinneD> as no DOM element is used
[10:58:42] <ajpiano> that's cause it is NOT $.tasks
[10:58:53] <ajpiano> it's just tasks({action: "update"})
[10:58:58] <ajpiano> i gues i could have done it that way too
[10:59:13] <ajpiano> but that's not how it's implemented now
[10:59:22] <sinneD> ah, thanks :)
[10:59:41] <sinneD> you are a scholar and a gentleman, thank you for helping me out !
[11:00:31] <ajpiano> sinneD: here's the other way http://jsfiddle.net/7qhVb/3/
[11:00:32] <ajpiano> welcome :)
[11:00:35] <ajpiano> hope you get some milage out of it
[11:00:41] <sinneD> I definitely will
[11:00:57] <sinneD> it's one of the first apps against Google Tasks API
[11:02:44] <sinneD> anyway, I need to leave
[11:02:50] <sinneD> monokrome, ajpiano, thank you so mucj
[11:02:55] <sinneD> *much
[11:03:00] <ajpiano> okay! gluck :)
[11:03:04] <sinneD> made my day :)(
[11:03:41] <OvidiuB> ajpiano, can you please help me add cookie for tabs ? this is the code for the current working tabs: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/459488/
[11:03:46] <ajpiano> i an't
[11:03:47] <ajpiano> sorry
[11:03:49] <ajpiano> i have to clean
[11:03:57] <OvidiuB> oh, ok
[11:05:51] <monokrome> Why do you need cookies for tabs?
[11:06:15] <OvidiuB> I need them because I have pagination in 2'nd tab
[11:06:49] <OvidiuB> as soon as i go to the second page, I end up on the first tab
[11:07:58] <monokrome> You can choose what tab a link goes to by using a hash of their ID
[11:08:08] <monokrome> example.com/#tab-1
[11:08:37] <OvidiuB> that's the current working state
[11:08:51] <OvidiuB> I can't add hash to the pagination though
[11:09:01] <OvidiuB> I need it for WordPress
[11:09:08] <monokrome> :/
[11:09:22] <OvidiuB> I would have to mess with WordPress core
[11:09:30] <monokrome> WordPress is open source, and what about people with cookies disabled? They can't use your site? :/
[11:10:08] <OvidiuB> a cookie would take care of this to remember the tab
[11:10:20] <monokrome> Sure, for users who have cookies.
[11:10:40] <adragos> http://www.webgurus.biz/adminskin2/dashboard.html
[11:10:53] <OvidiuB> they can use it just fine but for thouse who don't... they can just use the current working state
[11:10:58] <adragos> I cannot select text in draggable divs
[11:11:05] <OvidiuB> but it is annoying
[11:11:17] <adragos> can someone look over the web page? I've no idea why
[11:11:27] <adragos> http://www.webgurus.biz/adminskin2/dashboard.html
[11:15:57] <MoTiOnXml> if I do $("<tagName><joe/></tagName>").html() I get "<joe/>", not the entire fragment. How come?
[11:16:06] <MoTiOnXml> it's like jQuery skips the root container
[11:16:56] <MoTiOnXml> basically i'm after a string-representation of my fragment
[11:18:20] <MoTiOnXml> anyone? :)
[11:18:26] <MoTiOnXml> no? :)
[11:19:31] <Kae|2> $('<div>').append($("<tagName><joe/></tagName>")).html()
[11:20:23] <Kae|2> hey MotionXml, have you tried that code line above?
[11:20:43] <MoTiOnXml> Kae|2: i found something on SO that says you should create a container
[11:20:52] <MoTiOnXml> Kae|2: i don't get why, actually ..
[11:21:41] <Kae|2> html function will return the inner html code
[11:21:50] <Kae|2> not the whole fragment as you want
[11:21:51] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: .html() gives you the innerHTML of the selected element thus the innerHTML of <tagname></tagname> is <joe />
[11:21:58] <Kae|2> that's why I created a wrapper
[11:21:58] <MoTiOnXml> ah dang :/
[11:21:59] <danzik17> MoTiOnXml: .html() --> innerHTML (ignoring any magic that they do to make it cross-browser).  What you're looking for (but doesn't exist) is .outerHtml, but you can implement it easily
[11:23:03] <mbrevda_> anyone familiar with jstree?
[11:23:21] <MoTiOnXml> thanks all, that clarified it
[11:23:29] <MoTiOnXml> i'll use a container and go with .html()
[11:23:39] <MoTiOnXml> i'm serializing form state to XML
[11:23:44] <Kae|2> cool :)
[11:23:56] <MoTiOnXml> it's a dynamic form designer for my CMS built with jQuery
[11:24:02] <MoTiOnXml> it's really cool actually
[11:24:15] <MoTiOnXml> with sortables and all, slick'n'slicky
[11:24:40] <MoTiOnXml> back in 2000 writing forms for clients was like "i just want a button to move things up or down"
[11:25:02] <MoTiOnXml> in 2011 it's like "i want full drag/drop bla. bla."
[11:25:15] <MoTiOnXml> but thanks to jQuery, it's all nice and dandy
[11:25:32] <Kae|2> yep and nicer than flash XD
[11:25:38] <danzik17> "Oh, can we have a marquee element below the form?" <---
[11:33:44] <shesek_> Anyone has some spare time to take a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7079582/sharing-unit-testing-fixtures ?
[11:39:33] <jaayyyyyyyyyyy> does someone know how to fire jquery from codebehind in aspc#
[11:39:55] <jaayyyyyyyyyyy> im having a bit of trouble hiding a div with jquery from code behind
[11:40:12] <jaayyyyyyyyyyy> i have tried several methods from google and have come up with nothing :(
[11:41:15] <Zol> Anyone know of a good image carousel that can show multiple images at once of different width?
[11:42:48] <keith_loy> Zol, you can code one pretty easily
[11:42:59] <keith_loy> you just need the carousel to slide a block element like a div
[11:43:04] <keith_loy> then place whatever images you want it
[11:43:50] <keith_loy> to make a carousel you just need to have a wrapping element with an overflow of hidden
[11:44:36] <Zol> keith_loy: I want to show all images, but hide overflow on window width - but I just found something I can tweak till satisfaction
[11:45:12] <Zol> thanks
[11:47:56] <KeepSafe> Hi, would anybody be able to tell me how to re-bind events when a change is detected in teh html?
[11:48:33] <efflux_> would live() work?
[11:48:56] <ajpiano> KeepSafe: there is not a bulletproof method of "detecting changes in html"
[11:49:03] <ajpiano> you can take a look at see ?liveQuery
[11:49:04] <bot-t> ajpiano, Plugins/livequery - Live Query utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM updated. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[11:49:08] <ajpiano> or see ?newContent
[11:49:08] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[11:49:15] <jaayyyyyyyyyyy> i hate c#
[11:49:20] <ajpiano> but both of those require you to add the content using jQuery
[11:49:29] <ajpiano> not just "react when the html changes no matter what
[11:49:30] <ajpiano> "
[11:49:42] <KeepSafe> live looks liek it will work
[11:49:45] <KeepSafe> thanks
[11:49:54] <KeepSafe> it just needed to be persistant binding
[11:50:48] <efflux_> np.. take a look at delegate() as well
[11:50:50] <Brodingo> isnt this where you mention delegate
[11:50:53] <Brodingo> ^
[11:51:09] <efflux_> heh
[11:52:31] <keith_loy> @KeepSafe use event delegation
[11:52:37] <keith_loy> that is a better solution
[11:52:54] <ajpiano> true story

[11:58:28] <jaayyyyyyyyyyy> does anyone here use jquery with c#?
[12:00:14] <burzum> can anyone suggest me a good rounded corner plugin for jquery?
[12:00:16] <jaayyyyyyyyyyy> http://pastebin.com/BtsYjqAs
[12:02:07] <letterpress> is there an ajax event that fires when the request times out?
[12:02:39] <letterpress> (without a response in this case)
[12:05:20] <erichynds> letterpress: error
[12:05:33] <erichynds> i think the 2nd arg to the callback is the error text
[12:05:37] <erichynds> which will equal timeout
[12:06:55] <letterpress> cool thx.
[12:08:07] <crankharder> how do I set up a widget to take a required parameter?
[12:18:51] <iateadonut> rounded corners for ie 7 and 8?
[12:19:01] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/vzPZQhsD   ---- wtf is wrong with my json Success??
[12:19:10] <swiggy> it keeps filling my text with 'undefined'
[12:19:15] <swiggy> when it clearly isnt undefined
[12:21:05] <kborchers> swiggy: it may just be returning your data as text and not creating the JS object. see ?parseJSON
[12:21:06] <bot-t> swiggy, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[12:22:11] <danzik17> swiggy:  Is dataType case sensitive? (I use lower as a rule, never tried uppers, so no idea)
[12:23:18] <kborchers> danzik17: the docs list it as dataType
[12:23:28] <kborchers> oh you mean the JSON part
[12:23:36] <danzik17> yup
[12:23:48] <kborchers> hmmm, yeah may need to be json
[12:25:58] <swiggy> wow
[12:26:00] <swiggy> danzik17,
[12:26:04] <swiggy> you were right lol
[12:26:11] <swiggy> somethign so stupid.. grrr i hatemyself sometimes
[12:26:20] <kborchers> good catch danzik17
[12:37:25] <grey> Will jQuery not descend many levels while searching for a class? I have a class that's nested and it doesn't appear to be returning matches past the first level?
[12:37:44] <snover> jQuery does whatever you tell it to do
[12:37:47] <kborchers> would need to see your selector
[12:38:54] <grey> $(".my_class").toggle();    I have for example, <ul><li class="my_class"><ul><li class="my_class nested">foo</li></ul></li></ul>
[12:39:06] <grey> kind of gross, I know, but it's a recursively built list/tree
[12:49:42] <Brodingo> why hasnt jquery returned my pizza yet? i called like 30 minutes ago
[12:51:04] <sacho> it's in the queue.
[12:51:46] <Brodingo> i swear to god if black olives === true im gonna flip out
[12:53:05] <pr0ton_> Brodingo, i thought that was python's job!
[12:53:07] <Woet> $("#pizza").fadeOut().remove();
[12:53:28] <Brodingo> moar like $('#pizza').slice() amirite
[12:53:39] <Woet> no :(
[13:05:23] <alaing_> hi i am using jquery ui autocomplete. is there a way i can return a different value to the one the user selected?
[13:06:30] <gf3> no
[13:06:35] <gf3> unpossible
[13:07:04] <alaing_> so no way of even altering the value
[13:07:08] <dnlmzw> hello. im having some problems with IE8 and stack overflow. im binding a 'load' to an image but its crashing. any suggestions?
[13:07:30] <dnlmzw> i have tried to unbind it and everything. but nothing.
[13:07:50] <sir_tyrion> How would you select a div like this: <div original-title></div> ... $("div original-title")?
[13:08:11] <ajpiano> alaing_ yes you can... see this demo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[13:08:18] <alaing_> sir_tyrion: that not valid html
[13:08:21] <ajpiano> use the select event and set whatever you want to be the actual .val of the input
[13:09:20] <sir_tyrion> alaing_ I know, but is there a way to select for it?
[13:10:19] <alaing_> sir_tyrion: does the "original title attr have a value?
[13:10:59] <sir_tyrion> no it doesn't
[13:11:03] <sir_tyrion> it looks like that
[13:11:04] <jproffer> hey guys having whats probably a css issue, with some drag/drop i have implemented via jquery's .draggable()
[13:11:21] <danzik17> sir_tyrion: You could try $('div[original-title]') since it may be treated as an attr, but if it has no value, what's the point?
[13:11:21] <alaing_> thanks  ajpiano i must of missed that demo as thats eactly what I'm looking for
[13:11:21] <jproffer> i have items in a jquery accordion that i need to be draggable to a container thats droppable
[13:11:47] <jproffer> when i drag the icon past the accordion container it disappears. is there any way to break it out of the accordion's bounds?
[13:12:33] <sir_tyrion> danzik17 that worked
[13:13:59] <jproffer> http://pastebin.com/RcKP2VtM is my drag code
[13:14:32] <alaing_> ajpiano: what exactly is the .data doing in that demo?
[13:14:55] <alaing_> I which like the way its added extract detail below the option
[13:14:58] <ajpiano> fetching the autocomplete instance and redefining its renderItem method
[13:15:53] <kborchers> jproffer: probably has to do with your containment option. what is "droppable"?
[13:16:03] <jproffer> a div
[13:16:21] <kborchers> ok, is that the id, a class?
[13:16:25] <jproffer> i have 2 divs, 1 as id="droppable" the other contains the accordion
[13:16:36] <kborchers> so that needs to be #droppable
[13:16:45] <jproffer> oops class not id
[13:16:54] <kborchers> does droppable also contain the accordion?
[13:17:00] <jproffer> no
[13:17:00] <kborchers> make it ".droppable" then
[13:17:02] <alaing_> so the return bit is redefining how the option look?
[13:17:37] <kborchers> containment has to contain the draggables, that is how it works.
[13:17:55] <jproffer> i see. yeah ok. so i need to set that to the container that contains both draggable and droppable
[13:18:39] <kborchers> right
[13:19:11] <jproffer> hmm that didnt seem to work.  both are inside a colorbox popup container, and the div container that holds both divs is #cboxLoadedContent
[13:19:26] <jproffer> so i set container="#cboxLoadedContent".  it still clips when i drag past the accordion container
[13:19:57] <kborchers> ?demo @ jproffer
[13:19:58] <bot-t> jproffer, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:20:22] <jproffer> forget that. it takes forever to mess with jsfiddle
[13:20:31] <jproffer> ill just try trail and error. thanks
[13:21:18] <kborchers> ok, well without seeing it in action, it's just hard to figure out what's wrong imagining it all in my head. sorry
[13:22:38] <jproffer> yeah no prob. it just takes too long to use jsfiddle to the point where you have a functional demo of a small segment of a lot of code
[13:23:06] <kborchers> jproffer: try also setting the appendTo option to #cboxLoadedContent
[13:23:21] <kborchers> for the draggables
[13:23:22] <jproffer> appendTo works fine, when i drop it drops to the right container
[13:23:30] <jproffer> just cant see it once it leaves the accordion container
[13:23:46] <jproffer> but it does show up in the drop container when you drop.
[13:23:51] <kborchers> that is really strange
[13:24:03] <jproffer> im creating a clone when i drop, maybe thats it?
[13:24:11] <jproffer> var element = $(ui.draggable).clone();
[13:27:10] <Iarfen> hi
[13:27:37] <Iarfen> is there a plugin to make appear a square selector when I move the mouse inside an image??
[13:28:19] <krogant> hi, i'm trying to fire an event once an iframe is loaded, atm, i have $('#iframeid').load(function(){....}); but it seems to fire before it's fully loaded. what's wrong?
[13:30:09] <jproffer> krogant, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2178628/detecting-dom-ready-state-within-an-iframe-jquery
[13:31:34] <krogant> jproffer: ah, no. my code is outside the iframe
[13:31:45] <jproffer> yes i know.
[13:31:52] <jproffer> that fires code outside the frame when it's loaded.
[13:32:05] <jproffer> .read and .load will fire prematurely
[13:32:20] <jproffer> alternatively you could set a timeout to check for a dom element in the iframe to verify that its ready, and cancel the timer
[13:32:44] <iateadonut> what does anyone use to implement rounded corners in ie 7 and 8?
[13:33:09] <krogant> iateadonut: css3please.com ?
[13:33:23] <jproffer> css3 works in ie 7/8?
[13:34:08] <alaing_> I would like to learn and start using git for my own personal project. Any good hints/tips?
[13:34:16] <alaing_> jproffer: no
[13:34:18] <tbranyen> jproffer: there are work arounds for 7/8 for several css3 things
[13:34:21] <tbranyen> using filters
[13:34:26] <tbranyen> and hacks and snacks and shiz
[13:34:29] <alaing_> jproffer: i use css3pie
[13:34:44] <jproffer> yeah i didnt think it did. it was more of a question as an answer ;)
[13:34:48] <alaing_> its a javascript solution to do some things like rounded corners etc
[13:35:15] <kborchers> alaing_: contribute to jQuery / jQuery UI ... that's how I learned :)
[13:35:35] <alaing_> i will when i get a moment
[13:36:06] <alaing_> is there an irc channel for git?
[13:36:09] <FunnyLookinHat> Can .prepend() have a callback ?
[13:36:29] <alaing_> why do you want a callback?
[13:37:07] <krogant> alaing_: #git ? ##git?
[13:37:15] <krogant> alaing_: search for the git book
[13:37:21] <Jarred> So I'm getting a strange issue here - I'm getting a 'next is not defined' error, when I don't undertstand how that's not the case. http://55ff.localtunel.com User --> student@jantire.com, password -> daman19912
[13:37:33] <Jarred> Next is most definitely defined
[13:37:37] <Jarred> It's an argument for the function
[13:37:45] <Jarred> and it's checked before it's throwing an error
[13:37:48] <Jarred> and I'm not re-assigning it to something
[13:38:19] <alaing_> krogant: search for the git book? as in google?
[13:39:58] <tomkane> can anyone provide guidance on using $.ajax to post a form, particularly how to add the data object to the options?
[13:40:27] <aaronw-1> "the data object" ?
[13:40:29] <alaing_> ?.ajax
[13:40:30] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:41:21] <tomkane> bot-t: is the settings a variable or is that would I need to insert?
[13:41:21] <bot-t> tomkane, Without a doubt.
[13:41:33] <iateadonut> css3pie looks great.  thanks.
[13:41:51] <tomkane> can I use serialize to grab the data from the form?
[13:41:51] <alaing_> no problem iateadonut
[13:42:05] <alaing_> tomkane:  yes
[13:42:34] <alaing_> data: $('#myform').serialise()
[13:43:50] <tomkane> alaing_: okay, I wasn't putting the #myform in there -- I thought since it fell under the #myform selector it was assumed. I'll try it. thanks
[13:44:11] <iateadonut> cool, and you don't need an extra style sheet with the <!--[if ie 8] thing going on.
[13:44:31] <iateadonut> where were you two hours ago? ;)
[13:44:33] <iateadonut> thanks again.
[13:46:01] <alaing_> i was lurking :P
[13:46:08] <tomkane> alaing_: that worked -- I'm posting the data okay.
[13:46:54] <funkymonk> glad that worked tomkane
[13:48:46] <ElGoorf> probably a commonly asked question but i cant anything on google. i have a container div with stuff inside, yet it wont budge from 0 height unless i set height manually
[13:48:51] <tomkane> my ajax data is coming back in json format but I'm getting a file open/save dialog box showing up. does that ring a bell for anyone?
[13:49:20] <ElGoorf> http://jsfiddle.net/nXQ96/   div to look for is "storewindowframe"
[13:50:08] <teamcoltra> Does anyone know of a more recent version of http://tablesorter.com/docs/ this type of plugin?
[13:50:16] <smplstk> bot-t: do you like tomkane?
[13:50:16] <bot-t> smplstk, My reply is no.
[13:50:20] <smplstk> inorite
[13:50:48] <teamcoltra> I need a plugin that will sort table data and can be sortable by multiple fields
[13:50:56] <ElGoorf> oops i clicked wrong chan ignore me
[13:51:45] <tomkane> I take it that's a no. thanks anyway
[13:52:51] <smplstk> tomkane: whatever script is serving up your json file, make sure the headers are set properly
[13:53:33] <smplstk> in PHP: header('Content-type: application/json');
[13:54:10] <smplstk> tomkane: chances are it's more than just that...
[13:54:17] <tomkane> smplstk: I'll double check that. I'm working with a catalyst framework for the server and it's another world of issues. thanks.
[14:00:22] <DofLeFou> Anyone know of good Jquery plugins for displaying XML content
[14:02:45] <interopcop> anybody have a good tutorial for writing 'observers' for forms in jquery?  I need to watch a chekcbox and uncheck (or check) any of it's "children" checkboxes if it's checked or unchecked.  ala https://gist.github.com/1150163
[14:03:45] <interopcop> so if rca_system_ids_29 changes state, then all of the checkboxes inside of "tenants_box" change state as well
[14:04:26] <interopcop> trouble is, it's not always rca_system_ids_29, it's rca_system_ids_N where N is the parent system.id
[14:08:04] <danzik17> interopcop:  Use a live/delegate handler for that, or just trigger and catch your own custom event
[14:13:48] <interopcop> danzik17: I am this close >| |< to a total noob - so of the two you suggested, which is easier?
[14:14:47] <danzik17> interopcop - Hah, they're actually both pretty easy.  Personally, I'd use a delegate there http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:17:26] <interopcop> danzik17: https://gist.github.com/1150163 - ok will my alert pop up when you click the checkbox?
[14:18:36] <danzik17> interopcop:  Use http://jsfiddle.net for making test cases, but no - that's not quite right
[14:19:05] <DanceNode> Public Service Announcement: Today is the birthday of the mother of software, sex, and sound, Madonna: http://i.imgur.com/brnws.jpg
[14:19:07] <danzik17> You use a delegate on some common container (or document is there is none), and the selector matches the elements whose event you want to handle
[14:19:14] <kitikonti> is there a jquery slider (slideshow) where i can use text in the slides? i dont only want a list of images
[14:19:38] <kitikonti> i need something like this http://wall.plasm.it/#examples but for jquery
[14:19:57] <DanceNode> Does Jquery have any slippery SOAP plugins?
[14:20:08] <iateadonut> PIE is great!
[14:20:16] <iateadonut> fast loading, you don't have to do much.
[14:22:26] <kitikonti> anyone an idea?
[14:28:06] <mek1> How do I select a table row between two rows with ids. http://dpaste.com/595979/ (the row containing 123)
[14:28:44] <kborchers> $("#abc").next()
[14:29:11] <kborchers> or $("#def").prev();
[14:29:56] <mek1> Oh.. it was that easy
[14:30:13] <kborchers> yep ;)
[14:30:42] <interopcop> danzik17: I just don't get it
[14:30:55] <mek1> Another question then, im trying to use jQuery together with django, im posting data with .ajax but I never get to the error part, but always to the success
[14:31:18] <interopcop> I need a handholding experience - any tutorials that build up knowledge from "stupid" to "barely acceptable"?
[14:31:18] <mek1> All im sending back is a json with success set to true or false
[14:31:41] <kborchers> error only fires if there is an http error status sent back
[14:31:59] <mek1> Oh ok, I thought so, so just make sure to change http status then?
[14:32:00] <kborchers> like 404 or 500
[14:32:13] <kborchers> yep
[14:32:23] <danzik17> interopcop:  The docs on the jquery site are pretty well written, you'd learn a lot just by reading those.  Or make a jsfiddle testcase so that someone can help more easily
[14:32:49] <mek1> interopcop: browse the demos on jquery ui site
[14:33:50] <RoosterJuice_> is there some kind of site where you can get lists of stuff to use in forms for dropdowns?
[14:33:59] <RoosterJuice_> for example: a list of all cities in canada?
[14:34:02] <RoosterJuice_> or USA
[14:34:23] <interopcop> ok http://jsfiddle.net/97stU/  I do not understand the selector, eventType, handler stuff in the delegate docs
[14:35:14] <danzik17> Is there a better way of extending the returned data from an ajax call then resolving an additional deferred (http://pastebin.com/mGZhr3GW)?  It just seems like there should be an easier way
[14:37:25] <sic1> I've been doin some html templating testing today, jQote2 is very overlooked - http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/192
[14:37:52] <sic1> its fast and easy to use, use it! http://aefxx.com/api/jqote2-reference/
[14:37:57] <ajpiano> danzik17 $.ajax({ success: dfd.resolve, error: dfd. reject});
[14:39:09] <interopcop> can a selector be any tag in the html?  I guess, first, is a selector a tag?
[14:39:20] <interopcop> i.e. body or table or input
[14:39:37] <danzik17> interopcop:  http://jsfiddle.net/97stU/1/
[14:39:54] <danzik17> ajpiano:  Thanks, thanks essentially what I'm doing - guess that answers it
[14:40:02] <danzik17> thats*
[14:40:21] <interopcop> danzik17: ok that answers one of my questions - very nice :) thanks
[14:40:45] <interopcop> now, how do I change the state of every child of that selector...?
[14:41:14] <ajpiano> danzik17: you might be able to use http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[14:41:52] <danzik17> ajpiano:  I actually tried earlier, but since $.ajax returns a promise and not a deferred, it bombed
[14:42:04] <ajpiano> ah
[14:43:46] <ajpiano> wait... there's an example on this page of using it with $.ajax...
[14:45:14] <danzik17> ajpiano:  Unless I'm doing something wrong, I don't think it works - trying in the Chrome js console as we speak
[14:48:02] <muhdick> should u use classes for css selector
[14:48:13] <muhdick> or is it better to use name
[14:48:19] <danzik17> ajpiano: And in fact the docs right above it show .pipe being called on the deferred objects, not the promise - so I think that's just a bad example
[14:48:25] <muhdick> ajpiano
[14:48:31] <muhdick> do u have an opion on this
[14:50:08] <muhdick> or
[14:50:13] <muhdick> someone else?
[14:50:30] <imsky> lol
[14:50:38] <imsky> some reasoned discourse with muhdick
[14:50:45] <imsky> i told muhdick he was wrongf
[14:50:49] <imsky> he shrank from the evidence
[14:50:50] <muhdick> where
[14:50:57] <muhdick> no one replyed
[14:52:43] <danzik17> muhdick:  If I had to guess - class.  There's more native support for classes I think, so it'd be faster.
[14:52:53] <ajpiano> huh what
[14:53:00] <ajpiano> classes is a million times faster than attributes
[14:53:04] <imsky> a trillion
[14:53:22] <abjorn> more
[14:53:22] <ajpiano> danzik17: if you think it's misdocumented can you create a fiddle and file a ticket :)
[14:53:53] <danzik17> ajpiano:  Yep
[14:54:12] <muhdick> i mean what about if i passed if i needed to give the designer to design some stuff
[14:54:16] <muhdick> wont he break the app
[14:54:21] <muhdick> if i use class?
[14:54:28] <muhdick> and he uses class to style?
[14:54:44] <ajpiano> huh
[14:55:00] <muhdick> i mean this is what my coworker thinks
[14:55:05] <muhdick> this isnt my opinon
[14:55:11] <imsky> muhdick has no opinion
[14:55:11] <muhdick> i think class is ok
[14:55:13] <muhdick> but
[14:55:14] <imsky> i tell him what to think
[14:55:29] <muhdick> he thinks that classes should only be use to style
[14:55:34] <muhdick> not as a selector
[14:55:36] <muhdick> what do u think
[14:55:40] <ajpiano> he is wrong
[14:55:43] <ajpiano> woefully wrong
[14:55:44] <muhdick> i mean is there something
[14:56:22] <muhdick> ok well he is here now
[14:56:25] <muhdick> nad he is pissed
[14:56:31] <muhdick> and gonna let u have some of his mind
[14:56:35] <ajpiano> ...
[14:56:38] <Bower^> does jquery have any control over the styling of scroll bars? i appreciate i should be doing that in CSS but evidently that isn't possible
[14:56:42] <muhdick> hey
[14:56:44] <mek1> Any special trick to get .reset() to work on a form?
[14:56:45] <muhdick> i just asked him
[14:56:53] <ajpiano> Bower^: no
[14:56:55] <muhdick> if it would a good practice would be
[14:56:59] <Bower^> Thanks
[14:57:01] <mek1> Tried $("#form")[0].reset(); but that wont work
[14:57:05] <muhdick> if i would classes only for solely styling
[14:57:14] <muhdick> i could give my app anytime to any designer
[14:57:22] <muhdick> and he/she could change anything anywhere
[14:57:31] <muhdick> renaming classes... deleting them.. etc.
[14:57:49] <muhdick> whereas, if my code depends on them.. he/she can't
[14:57:52] <ajpiano> that is really silly
[14:58:02] <muhdick> it is a thought
[14:58:05] <ajpiano> typically what a designer WANTS you to provide
[14:58:14] <ajpiano> is a set of class names to use and implement that are already on the elements
[14:58:16] <ajpiano> that you're generating
[14:58:27] <muhdick> maybe.. what happens if the style changes?
[14:58:35] <muhdick> a little bit here and there
[14:58:36] <ajpiano> they can change the style or add new classes
[14:58:44] <ajpiano> or.... you can use different classes for behaviour and styling
[14:58:58] <muhdick> but then.. you could argue
[14:59:01] <ajpiano> the idea that classes are somehow definitely only for styling
[14:59:05] <muhdick> to use html5 attributes
[14:59:09] <ajpiano> is just not substantiated by anything other than opinion
[14:59:14] <dlam> is there a way to put the cursor in a textarea without calling  .focus() on it?
[14:59:28] <imsky> no
[14:59:34] <muhdick> originally they have been only for styling i guess
[15:00:08] <dlam> because focus() like shifts the screen
[15:00:25] <ajpiano> is that why browsers have been implementing getElementsByClassName ?
[15:00:46] <ajpiano> because classes are "only for styling"
[15:00:55] <danzik17> ajpiano:  Never mind bout it not working.  Let's just say I didn't notice the little "added in 1.6" minor detail on the docs.
[15:01:06] <ajpiano> danzik17: oh :x
[15:01:23] <muhdick> why did browsers call it XMLHttpRequest object?
[15:01:29] <muhdick> because it's only for XML?
[15:01:32] <imsky> like all things, because of microsoft
[15:01:37] <muhdick> just saying, it was merely a thought
[15:01:43] <ajpiano> muhdick: how is that even an analogy
[15:01:52] <muhdick> because browsers implement something
[15:02:02] <muhdick> doesn't mean you have to use it that way.. dunno
[15:02:11] <ajpiano> muhdick: they implemented getElementsByClassName because libraries implemented because developers needed and wanted it
[15:02:14] <muhdick> it doesn't mean it's nright or wrong
[15:02:23] <ajpiano> how can you use getElementsByClassName to do anything but get elements by their class name
[15:02:56] <ajpiano> this is kind of a waste of energy as far as discussions go..... i'll leave you to your own devices :)
[15:03:25] <muhdick> i just wantyed to know what a good practice is
[15:03:27] <muhdick> that's all
[15:03:35] <ajpiano> a good practise is to use class names
[15:03:47] <ajpiano> attributes is a slow as balls way to query the dom and much more verbose
[15:04:42] <muhdick> yeah, the performance point is right i guess
[15:05:00] <muhdick> maybe it's good to have navigation classes..
[15:05:10] <muhdick> nav only..
[15:05:27] <muhdick> but thx for your input @ajpiano
[15:05:41] <ajpiano> muhdick: i agree that it's bad to have javascirpt that's tightly coupled to your DOM structure
[15:05:41] <muhdick> he is gone now
[15:05:54] <ajpiano> but that can break from desingers changing markup and tags and othert hings as well
[15:05:59] <muhdick> u have to excuse my friend
[15:06:05] <ajpiano> it doesn't just magically get fixed by "only using classes for style"
[15:06:33] <sic1> i thought jquery was majik!
[15:07:52] <imsky> it is
[15:08:00] <imsky> it's the magic of google searching
[15:08:02] <sic1> ^ :)
[15:08:10] <sic1> lol
[15:08:32] <muhdick> that's true
[15:08:37] <muhdick> it's coupled
[15:08:43] <muhdick> jQuery also changes styles
[15:08:47] <muhdick> and so on
[15:09:02] <muhdick> and HTML..
[15:10:16] <gf3> nope
[15:10:19] <gf3> just styles
[15:11:03] <ajpiano> muhdick: my point is there's a lot that a designer could do to break your javascript depending on how your js is written and what the designer does
[15:11:09] <ajpiano> and there isn't one magical formula that's gonna stop that
[15:11:17] <nullwire> I'm sending a get request, which receives a response file. Inside of the get function(data) { i am setting a predefined variable to the response. however outside of the response it is acting like the data was not stored in the variable. what can I do here?
[15:11:28] <gf3> unless you do EVERYTHING in javascript
[15:11:39] <gf3> which you should
[15:11:46] <mek1> So I have a form inside a modal window, on success I want to reset the form and close the modal, how is this done?
[15:12:01] <mek1> The closing part I got, but I cant find a way to reset the form
[15:12:26] <gf3> mek1: form.reset()
[15:12:40] <nullwire> not a response file, I mean a response
[15:12:56] <nullwire> or a response from a file rather
[15:15:27] <mek1> gf3: $("form").reset(); $("form").reset is not a function
[15:15:39] <supsup> so a client is asking me to add 2 different versions of jquery to the same page -- how bad of an idea is this I'm wondering?  Is it worse or better than using like protoype and jquery on the same page to do the same shit or is it better than that or equally bad ideas?
[15:16:09] <gf3> mek1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/form.reset
[15:16:11] <mek1> Shouldnt two versions collide for using the same functions names and such?
[15:16:45] <supsup> mek1 i'd assign a customer variable to the first jquery $ then use $ for the secound or so i'd assume -- i've never even thought of trying it before
[15:17:09] <mek1> Any reason for using 2 versions?
[15:17:17] <supsup> some plugin they want to use
[15:17:24] <supsup> i told them we should just upgrade their site to 1.6.2
[15:17:26] <supsup> instead
[15:17:41] <mek1> That is what I would have done
[15:17:53] <supsup> lol yah but they don't want to regression their site is what they said
[15:17:56] <supsup> so.. yah
[15:19:29] <supsup> when i said one page i ment every page on their site also hah.
[15:19:37] <supsup> the new little widget they want to add
[15:22:09] <supsup> was mostly wondering how bad of an idea it is, it seems horrible that was the reaction i gave just wondering if i'm blowing it up too big
[15:22:17] <supsup> on the api page they even made a option to allow it
[15:23:11] <plov> anyone know why when i added jquery-ui to my existing jquery site javascript using .click.show.hide no longer work? i get 0 errors, remove jquery-ui they work again
[15:23:23] <plov> jquery-ui overrides jquery's .hide .click .show or something?
[15:28:26] <morsik> it's possible to get data when statuscode is 400?
[15:28:43] <morsik> i'm sending 400 Bad Request with error message in json, like: {"error":"can't open directory"}
[15:28:50] <morsik> i'm using $.ajax()
[15:29:35] <jankidudel> after  onFocus event on  $('#input-pass'), i make this statement 			$('#input-pass').replaceWith($('#input-pass').clone().attr('type', 'password').toggleClass('gray').val('')); but after I want  chain  onBlur method , it doesn't work, so I believe after cloning $('#input-login') element is lost forever ?
[15:33:21] <jankidudel> thanks, solved
[15:33:37] <jankidudel> just needed to add tru to  clone() , like this  clone(true)
[15:56:38] <krogant> does code inside $(function(){...} function before all html is written or after?
[16:00:16] <Merrick> can any dev that is using google apps for small businees pm me please.
[16:01:58] <Merrick> why is the room so dead right now?
[16:07:55] <impatient> hello friends
[16:08:30] <impatient> does jquery.(whatever version) support any type of util method to grab me the previous/next sibling(s) of the matched element(s) ?
[16:09:16] <yogurt_truck> impatient: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[16:09:59] <impatient> excellent, thanks man
[16:11:02] <impatient> and a merry querySelectorAll to each and every one
[16:12:47] <impatient> on an unrelated note, why are there so few ops on freenode?
[16:15:36] <Vaerros> because annually, there's an op gladiatorial event held where ops fight each other to the death
[16:15:50] <Vaerros> only the strongest survive
[16:15:58] <Merrick> do any of the devs in here use google apps for small business?
[16:17:46] <RoosterJuice_> what does it mean when I get an 'Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new c.fn.init(a,b)} has no method 'type'
[16:17:47] <RoosterJuice_> error
[16:18:56] <DanceNode> RoosterJuice_: It means your code is doing it wrong.
[16:19:09] <RoosterJuice_> ya
[16:19:12] <RoosterJuice_> it does
[16:19:17] <Merrick> lol, rooster, are u doing something like var foo = function ()
[16:19:38] <Merrick> ?
[16:20:10] <RoosterJuice_> i'm trying to implement this: http://laktek.com/2011/03/03/introducing-jquery-smart-autocomplete/
[16:20:52] <impatient> c.fn.whatever
[16:21:04] <impatient> fn = prototype alias?
[16:22:17] <Merrick> rooster, give me a moment, im checking it out now.
[16:26:49] <Merrick> if you copied and pasted those script tags, in aint gonna work cause the source for the autocomplete isn't being found.
[16:26:56] <Merrick> oops, @rooster
[16:27:24] <Merrick> <script src="jquery.smart_autocomplete.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[16:27:38] <Merrick> roosterjuice, did you move the js file to ur server?
[16:46:22] <Ogredude> I've got a .change handler tied to one of my input fields.  What's going to be the best way to trigger that event from an automated test suite?  I'm on capybara, webkit, RSpec, and I can indeed evaluate javascript right from the test case.
[16:48:34] <tomoyuki28jp> When $('form input:submit').click, how can I remove or rename some input elements?
[16:49:03] <impatient> the non-jquery way? :)
[16:49:24] <tomoyuki28jp> impatient: Are you saying that to me?
[16:49:32] <impatient> parent.removeChild(node) and/or node.name = "newname";
[16:49:33] <impatient> yes
[16:49:33] <krogant> what's the difference between $(function(){ vs $(window).load(function(){
[16:49:51] <tomoyuki28jp> impatient: thanks
[16:50:01] <impatient> krogant, the first doesn't necessarily fire when body.onload fires
[16:50:45] <krogant> impatient: i thought $(function() was a shortcut for $(window).load ...?
[16:51:11] <impatient> based on what I've read, not necessarily
[16:51:25] <Ogredude> oh bloody hell, I can just hit it with .change() and I'm done
[16:51:35] <impatient> tho $(function) -is- guaranteed to run no sooner than onload fires
[16:52:06] <krogant> so which should i use? $(function(){}); or $(window).load(function(){... ?
[16:52:25] <impatient> depends what you want to do I guess
[16:52:33] <krogant> impatient: because i've just come across some code which works with the latter, but not hte former
[16:52:44] <impatient> not surprising :)
[16:52:54] <impatient> onload fires (at least on body) after the dom tree has been build
[16:53:01] <krogant> why though? it's only taken about 4 hours to narrow it down
[16:53:20] <impatient> jquery's ready fires when -everything- is in place
[16:53:30] <impatient> purportedly anyway
[16:53:32] <krogant> well, everything meaning?
[16:54:01] <impatient> I'm not sure every element's content need be loaded for onload to fire
[16:54:24] <impatient> I -think- ready guarantees such things have completely loaded
[16:54:32] <impatient> I could be wrong tho, been a while since I read the docs
[16:54:40] <danheberden> impatient: it just means the dom is ready
[16:54:46] <danheberden> images could stil be loading
[16:55:16] <krogant> i think load is fully complete  no? http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[16:55:19] <impatient> then how is it any different than body.onload ?
[16:55:28] <krogant> In general, it is not necessary to wait for all images to be fully loaded. If code can be executed earlier, it is usually best to place it in a handler sent to the .ready() method.
[16:55:33] <danheberden> onload waits for all that shit to download
[16:55:36] <misterm> krogant: $(fn) is a shorthand for $().ready(), not $().load()
[16:55:38] <krogant> oh, it looks like load is fully complete, ready is no images
[16:55:56] <danheberden> and the shortcut is messy, IMO - hard to read
[16:55:56] <krogant> ahh
[16:56:02] <danheberden> $( document ).ready( fn ) ; is much cleaner
[16:56:04] <impatient> bizarre
[16:56:05] <krogant> i <3 the shortcut
[16:56:29] <impatient> wonder why krogant's code was failing on onload, but fine on ready
[16:56:52] <impatient> that's the exact opposite behavior one would expect given his assertion
[16:57:14] <krogant> impatient: it was the opposite way around ;)
[16:57:24] <misterm> Well they're not the same thing so I wouldn't be surprised if some code didn't work in both
[16:57:27] <danheberden> load needs to be bound to window, not ()
[16:57:30] <krogant> $(function() was failing (window).load was working
[16:57:32] <danheberden> $( window ).load()
[16:57:42] <impatient> alll
[16:57:43] <impatient> err
[16:57:45] <impatient> ahhh
[16:57:50] <impatient> I misread your statement earlier
[16:57:52] <krogant> so how do i know when to use doc read or window.load?
[16:58:07] <danheberden> rare is the time you need to use window.load
[16:58:16] <impatient> so does ready check readyStateChange or something?
[16:58:28] <danheberden> impatient: if it's available
[16:58:42] <danheberden> ?source domReady:
[16:58:43] <bot-t> (Result for ':') Line#1100 - "div.innerHTML = " <link/><table></table><a href='/a' style='color:red;float:left;opacity:.55;'>a</a><input type='checkbox'/>";" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1100
[16:58:52] <danheberden> hm, that might not work anymore
[16:58:56] <danheberden> anyway - it's in the source
[16:58:58] <misterm> lol
[16:59:06] <impatient> :D
[16:59:26] <krogant> http://jsfiddle.net/TzTne/1/
[16:59:41] <krogant> the code i pasted has been modified by jsfiddle to window.load
[17:00:10] <misterm> impatient: basically it will use DOMContentLoaded if it's available, and onload as a fallback
[17:00:51] <impatient> ahhh, there's the answer to my question
[17:00:56] <impatient> thanks for the insight :)
[17:01:46] <misterm> impatient: it's also possible to delay ready, which I don't know if you can do for load
[17:03:10] <impatient> will a blocking script postpone the event?
[17:04:33] <misterm> impatient: depends on what you mean exactly by "blocking", but what I am talking about is that your scripts can tell jQuery to delay the ready event
[17:04:58] <impatient> as in there's a jquery api to postpone it?
[17:05:20] <misterm> impatient: say if you had some things you wanted to do before you consider the page "ready" even though the browser would, you can use $.holdReady() to tell jQuery you want to say when things are ready
[17:05:35] <impatient> ahh
[17:14:59] <TeddyMurray> can you do $('#container').remove('*'); ?
[17:15:08] <TeddyMurray> empty just seems to remove all the text, leaving my child nodes
[17:15:34] <emanu> can you see in jquery how many ajax requests are currently in progress?
[17:16:23] <impatient> to do that I recently redefined XMLHttpRequest object
[17:16:40] <impatient> created new definitions for all the native methods
[17:16:56] <impatient> works like a charm except in legacy ie... bleh...
[17:18:02] <TeddyMurray> any ideas?
[17:18:04] <TeddyMurray> for remove('*');
[17:18:45] <impatient> can't help you :\
[17:18:57] <impatient> unfortunately (or not) I always fall back to standard dom methods
[17:19:24] <TeddyMurray> jquery is awesome :)
[17:19:28] <TeddyMurray> i would learn to use it
[17:20:19] <impatient> I use it where it makes sense to
[17:20:42] <TeddyMurray> i never use javascript anymore
[17:20:51] <TeddyMurray> jquery has replaced javascript as a language for me, lol XD
[17:21:17] <impatient> never written a jquery plugin?
[17:21:50] <Bower^> TeddyMurray, it is a brilliant library
[17:22:11] <TeddyMurray> nop
[17:23:09] <cccaldas> guys
[17:23:13] <cccaldas> did anyone use this ? http://plugins.jquery.com/project/scale9grid
[17:23:16] <cccaldas> is it good ?
[17:26:28] <krogant> my eyes are too tired - wtf? http://jsfiddle.net/TzTne/5/

[17:27:29] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[17:27:33] <gf3> krogant ^
[17:27:39] <krogant> ah
[17:28:45] <krogant> gf3gf3, the bot link doesn't return anything ;)
[17:29:14] <krogant> google is obviously becoming shitter
[17:30:02] <aka-> if I have a function that returns a dferred object promise and I want to dynamically call it multiple times in a loop but only react once all the promises are resolved how do I do that? Essentially i have an array of deferred promises and I want to have a done() handler when they are all resolved
[17:30:07] <gf3> Requests must respect the Same Origin Policy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy ). Requesting cross-domain content in javascript is generally prohibited. Seeing OPTIONS requests? See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
[17:30:17] <gf3> krogant ↑
[17:31:00] <krogant> aka-: when?
[17:31:38] <krogant> .when that is? ;)
[17:32:05] <aka-> krogant: hahah I was like, "what does he mean?"
[17:32:19] <aka-> krogant: so how do I pass in an array of defereds?
[17:32:29] <aka-> I only see how to pass in arguments for each defered
[17:32:33] <aka-> or am I missing something?
[17:34:06] <krogant> aka-: you ask a lot of questions, to which i cannot answer! from what i understand of them, it should be possible!
[17:34:22] <krogant> aka-: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[17:34:36] <aka-> ok, I just haven't been doing much ront end programming in about 12 months and this is my first day using deferred objects extensively
[17:36:39] <krogant> maybe the deferreds could call a method, and the .when can check to see if those methods have been called?
[17:38:02] <krogant> aka-: any help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4869609/how-can-jquery-deferred-be-used
[17:40:34] <aka-> krogant: I appreciate your help but I understand the basics of a deferred object. I am curious how to react to multiple defered objects being finished called dynamically
[17:41:05] <krogant> that last link was all about .when despite the title!
[17:41:16] <aka-> the $.when() method can't take an array or dynamically add defered objects as I can tell
[17:41:29] <gnarf> you're misusing $.when
[17:41:29] <impatient> are we talking about classical threading in javascript?
[17:41:47] * impatient gets a semi
[17:41:53] <gnarf> if you want to create a deferred, $.Deferred()
[17:41:54] <Vaerros> o.o
[17:42:27] <gnarf> $.when takes multiple deferred (or static values) and generates a single deferred that is resolved when all of its objects are resolved
[17:42:42] <gnarf> if you have an array of deferreds, you should $.when.apply( $, arrayOfDfds )
[17:42:54] <aka-> awesome. thanks gnarf
[17:51:02] <kitikonti> how could i select the first 5 li tags in a large list
[17:51:48] <misterm> kitikonti: select the elements then use .slice() to narrow it down
[17:53:33] <kitikonti> misterm: thx
[18:07:25] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there any easy way to delete everything on the DOM?
[18:11:06] <misterm> JohnnyDavidson: if you remove a node all of it's children will be removed too, so you can either take out the node that is the root of what you want to keep, or if you want to keep that node, delete it's children
[18:22:51] <abjorn> broz
[18:22:55] <abjorn> brooozz
[18:23:10] <abjorn> anyone know if you can exit out of an Array.prototype.forEach?
[18:26:42] <chjj> adbjorn: you cant unfortunately
[18:27:18] <chjj> abjorn: you *could* throw to get out of one, but obviously not ideal, and more work than its work
[18:27:29] <chjj> not even a reasonable solution
[18:28:00] <chjj> if you want to break, youll have to use a regular for, or your own foreach function
[18:33:34] <Ned_> is there a channel specific to jquerymobile ?
[18:33:39] * Ned_ has teh questions :p
[18:34:38] <misterm> Ned_: there's a developer channel, but for the most part UI questions are just asked here
[18:35:23] <Ned_> misterm: right, well in this case I'm trying to have a page that loads run a script
[18:35:33] <Ned_> i.e. have a script ont he page that's execute while the page is created
[18:35:46] <Ned_> but there's no easy way to have the script "aware" of the page in which is resides
[18:35:49] <Ned_> so far as I can tell ?
[18:36:06] <Ned_> does anyone know a nice way to have scripts loaded with pages such that they can easily bind to stuff on the page ?
[18:37:17] <Ned_> misterm: do you think it'd be worth asking about that ont he dev channel ?
[18:37:20] <Ned_> or I'd just get booed out ?
[18:37:21] <Ned_> :p
[18:37:33] <Lochlan> sup guys
[18:38:11] <Lochlan> i've got a dynamically generated element, I need to append some text to the ID of them but I'm struggling
[18:38:59] <Ned_> Lochlan: can't you just use the .attr() method to do that ?
[18:39:11] <Ned_> element.attr('id', element.attr('id') + '-suffix')
[18:39:12] <Ned_> ?
[18:39:22] <Lochlan> the trouble I'm having
[18:39:28] <Lochlan> is identifying the element
[18:39:42] <Lochlan> let me try to explain
[18:40:00] <Lochlan> im using knockoutjs to generate a series of messages
[18:40:09] <Lochlan> into multiple columns
[18:40:15] <Lochlan> some messages can appear in multiple columns
[18:40:20] <Lochlan> but they have the same messageID
[18:40:34] <Lochlan> which I'm putting onto the ID attribute
[18:40:52] <Lochlan> but since some messages appear twice, I need to append it, like you said
[18:41:01] <SIDU> coldhead: hi ~
[18:41:08] <Lochlan> say 20 messages are generated on load
[18:41:23] <Lochlan> i need to select all those messages, and then append the ID
[18:41:36] <Lochlan> im having trouble selecting them since they're dynamic
[18:41:38] <Ned_> well, when you're generating them
[18:41:43] <Ned_> don't you have references to them ?
[18:42:03] <Lochlan> I'm using a template, so it's like HTML with tags, e.g. <section class="message" id="${ MessageId }">
[18:42:14] <Lochlan> so the messageId is going straight into it there, you see
[18:42:18] <Ned_> sure,
[18:42:23] <Ned_> so you could change the template ;_)
[18:42:32] <Lochlan> yep
[18:42:33] <Ned_> but the template returns a DOM element right ?
[18:42:36] <Ned_> or a jQuery object
[18:42:37] <Lochlan> yep
[18:42:38] <Ned_> or something ?
[18:42:42] <Ned_> so,
[18:42:51] <Ned_> var element = $(...).templatesomething();
[18:42:56] <Ned_> then my line of code from up there ^^
[18:42:57] <Ned_> >?
[18:42:58] <Ned_> ?
[18:43:05] <SIDU> howto pass jq var into php? eg <?php $x=?>$('#id').html();<?php ;?>
[18:43:07] <Lochlan> I get what you mean
[18:43:13] <Lochlan> but this template isn't in the JS
[18:43:18] <Lochlan> it's in the HTML :/
[18:43:31] <Ned_> Lochlan: but there's a javascript call that's rendering the data into the template
[18:43:34] <Ned_> somewhere
[18:43:38] <Lochlan> yep, one sec...
[18:43:47] <Ned_> so my code goes _there_
[18:43:48] <Ned_> :-)
[18:43:58] <Lochlan> so here's that line: ko.applyBindings(feedView, document.getElementById(item.MessageId));
[18:44:23] <Ned_> no
[18:44:32] <Ned_> that's the line you're trying to use the rendered messages with isn't it ?
[18:44:40] <Ned_> before that, something's templating stuff and putting it in the DOM
[18:44:43] <Lochlan> that binds the JSON data I have to the template
[18:44:48] <Ned_> oh, does it ?
[18:44:51] <Lochlan> yep
[18:44:53] <Ned_> weird method names
[18:45:00] <Lochlan> yeah, I'm using knockoutjs
[18:45:01] <Ned_> okay, so what does that return ?
[18:45:21] <Ned_> you could just wrap console.log() around it
[18:45:22] <Lochlan> so I have an HTML template, and it just sends the values to the template
[18:45:24] <Ned_> and see what you get
[18:45:42] <Lochlan> the problem is, knockoutjs won't let me target with a .class #id, only #id
[18:46:21] <Ned_> I think you're missing my point :p
[18:46:35] <Lochlan> maybe I am
[18:46:35] <Ned_> in the simplist case, _somewhere_ you have code like this
[18:46:37] <Ned_> :
[18:46:54] <Ned_> var mytemplate = '<div id="${messageid}">...</div>';
[18:47:00] <Lochlan> ah yeah
[18:47:04] <Ned_> var mydata = { messageid: 'fred' };
[18:47:21] <Ned_> $('body').append($.template(mytemplate, mydata0);
[18:47:30] <Ned_> and what I'm saying is, change that last line in to:
[18:47:40] <Ned_> var elem = $.template(mytemplate, mydata);
[18:47:51] <Ned_> // mess with elem a bit
[18:47:56] <Lochlan> hmmm
[18:47:56] <Ned_> $('body').append(elem)
[18:48:19] <Ned_> the point is, if you're dynamically generating elements and inserting them into the DOM
[18:48:27] <Ned_> then at _some_ point you have a reference to them before the go into the DOM
[18:48:35] <Ned_> you should figure out where that is, and alter them there
[18:48:35] <Ned_> :_)
[18:48:38] <Lochlan> I know what you mean
[18:48:56] <Lochlan> but I don't think it applies unfortunately
[18:49:17] <Ned_> heh, well you can think that
[18:49:21] <Ned_> but you'd be wrong :p
[18:49:30] <Lochlan> my template sits inside a script tag, and it's just plain HTML with some variables
[18:49:36] <Ned_> if you're dynamically generating elements ... _somewhere_ is a reference for them before they go into the dom :p
[18:49:43] <Lochlan> knockoutjs passes it automatically
[18:49:45] <Ned_> Lochlan: yup, I see that
[18:49:57] <Ned_> Lochlan: I'm saying, somewhere there is code that mashes your data and the template together
[18:50:06] <Ned_> and then puts the result of that mashing into the DOM
[18:50:17] <Lochlan> might have to look in the knockoutjs file
[18:50:38] <Lochlan> don't really want to, though
[18:50:46] <Ned_> Lochlan: it seems unlikely you'd have to resort to that
[18:50:48] <Ned_> to make it work
[18:50:50] <SIDU> why frame is not allowed in html5 ?
[18:51:10] <systemfault> Because we left them in the 90's
[18:51:16] <SIDU> iframe is less handy than frame though
[18:51:20] <systemfault> Also, iframes are better.
[18:51:27] <Ned_> yes, iframes are far more useful
[18:51:34] <SIDU> ok
[18:51:39] <Ned_> SIDU: if you want to use frames, don't use html5
[18:51:42] <SIDU> i guess there must be some reason
[18:51:59] <Ned_> generally frames (even iframes) are a lot of unnecessary hassle
[18:52:08] <Ned_> especially with respect to javascript
[18:52:13] <WebDragon> indeed
[18:52:17] <SIDU> Ned_: i m ok with iframe. the only problem with iframe, i have to make some js to resize the iframe.
[18:52:22] <Lochlan> yeah iframes annoy me
[18:52:26] <Ned_> SIDU: why do you need an iframe ?
[18:52:54] <SIDU> Ned_: to save web traffic, the iframe data does not need to re-load
[18:53:08] <Ned_> SIDU: have you thought about using ajax stuff instead ?
[18:53:22] <chjj> SIDU: frames had a *laundry list* of problems
[18:53:38] <SIDU> Ned_: u r right. i found this. actually by using post, i can update part of the html page. so the iframe bit can stay.
[18:53:53] <SIDU> clever!
[18:54:01] <SIDU> i might rewrite code.
[18:54:10] <Ned_> any jquerymobile gurus here ?
[18:54:32] <SIDU> however, i still need some resize "div" on the page Ned_
[18:54:44] <Ned_> SIDU: what triggers the resizing ?
[18:54:57] <Ned_> (well, what do you want to trigger the resizing) /
[18:54:57] <Ned_> ?
[18:55:54] <SIDU> Ned_: originally there is a frame of tree menu on the left window. now i m going to replace with div, anyway this div need resize
[18:56:11] <Ned_> didn't really answer the question ...
[18:56:27] <SIDU> show|hide is handy with jq, but many times i need to resize the div
[18:56:43] <SIDU> like that of a frame
[18:56:44] <Ned_> you know that a div will expand/contract in size as you add and remove content from it
[18:57:07] <Ned_> ?
[18:57:16] <SIDU> Ned_: yes i know.
[18:57:27] <Ned_> so why do you need to manually resize it ?
[18:57:32] <Lochlan> when's it meant to resize?
[18:57:58] <SIDU> Ned_: ah. i need x|y scroll bar for the div, and resize handler, just same as frame
[18:58:33] <SIDU> maybe i use html4 for the frame, and html5 for the rest :D
[18:58:47] <Lochlan> just do overflow:auto; on the div to get scroll bars
[18:59:01] <Lochlan> and im sure there's loads of tuts to make resizeable divs, jquery ui can
[18:59:20] <SIDU> Lochlan: yes. that is what i m doing.
[18:59:39] <SIDU> Lochlan: yeah. i found there is a jq ui does the move, resize, drop ....
[19:00:59] <TeddyMurray> can you put a callback function on html() ?
[19:01:16] <TeddyMurray> my newly added elements need to exist, before the next code is run
[19:02:00] <SIDU> what's the jq code to get this: $('#iframeID').html() ?
[19:02:03] <Ned_> TeddyMurray: if you add elements using .html() they exist right then and there
[19:02:17] <SIDU> always blank
[19:02:26] <TeddyMurray> hmm, for some reason the jqgrid im using doesn't recognize the table
[19:02:31] <TeddyMurray> ill pastebin
[19:03:01] <TeddyMurray> http://pastebin.com/8P2GW63P
[19:03:09] <philosophically> is there a reason why height() would come up 0 in my code and not when i do it in the console?
[19:03:12] <SIDU> Lochlan: how to get html() of an iframe ?
[19:03:15] <TeddyMurray> its saying "Element is not a table"
[19:03:28] <misterm> philosophically: there must be, otherwise it wouldn't happen :-P
[19:03:31] <Tatsh> i can't tell what's going wrong here $.post
[19:03:33] <Tatsh> http://dpaste.com/596137/
[19:03:34] <Lochlan> SIDU, i don't think you can modify the content within an iframe
[19:03:45] <Tatsh> i specify json and the typeof data is object yet i can't access it like an object
[19:03:53] <philosophically> misterm: lol smartass :P
[19:04:15] <SIDU> Lochlan: i do not modify, i try to read the content of an iframe. well. maybe use get()
[19:04:25] <Lochlan> i'm not sure, SIDU
[19:04:33] <misterm> philosophically: are you *sure* you're getting the height of the same thing...not just that the selector is the same, but that it's returning the same element, are you sure nothing is changing the height, etc...could be a lot of things
[19:04:55] <Ned_> TeddyMurray: err,
[19:05:01] <Ned_> right before your jqGrid call
[19:05:06] <kborchers> SIDU: try $("#iframeID").contents().html();
[19:05:13] <TeddyMurray> lol!
[19:05:32] <SIDU> kborchers: ok . let me test ...
[19:05:33] <TeddyMurray> removed it, same error D:
[19:05:34] <Ned_> Hmmm, actually, no, I have no idea
[19:05:46] <Ned_> TeddyMurray: why not
[19:05:54] <Ned_> console.log($("#client_list"))
[19:05:58] <Ned_> just before the jqgrid call ?
[19:06:01] <Ned_> to see what's going on ?
[19:06:06] <TeddyMurray> kk, 1 moment
[19:06:07] <philosophically> misterm: oh.. not sure.. and this is localhost so i cant really show, but i'll paste some code maybe it will be apparent when i do
[19:06:14] <TeddyMurray> thanks for the help Ned_
[19:06:34] <TeddyMurray> ohhhhhhhhhh
[19:06:38] <misterm> philosophically: try recreating the problem in a jsfiddle
[19:06:39] <TeddyMurray> i have another element named #client_list :)
[19:06:52] <Ned_> TeddyMurray: :-)
[19:06:54] <TeddyMurray> awesome, thank you
[19:06:59] <Ned_> np
[19:07:03] <Ned_> console.log() is your friend
[19:11:43] <hemanth> why is getJSON failing for http://h3manth.com/t.php?hemanth  ? is it not a valid json
[19:11:54] <SIDU> kborchers: it return null
[19:13:37] <misterm> hemanth: are you getting an error in your script related to malformed JSON?
[19:14:23] <kborchers> SIDU: ok, then try $("#iframeID").contents().find("html").html(); that may strip off the html tags though so you may have to put them back in before you do anything with it.
[19:24:06] <hemanth> misterm: invalid label it says
[19:26:45] <coldhead> goodnight, mandric's computer
[19:35:13] <Lochlan> Ned_, GOT IT
[19:35:27] <abjorn> C++0x is an official standard now :) now C++ won't suck so much
[19:35:35] <Lochlan> there's a way to pass extra options using knockoutjs
[19:35:38] <Lochlan> what a relief
[19:56:49] <hemanth> "invalid label" on getjson for http://h3manth.com/t.php?hemanth
[20:01:23] <misterm> hemanth: code?
[20:02:11] <misterm> hemanth: did you check the requests in the debugger to make sure your response is good?
[20:04:25] <hemanth> misterm: yes it says 200ok
[20:05:29] <kborchers> hemanth: it looks like that returns the json in the body of an html document. i would imagine that is your problem but without seeing your code I can't be sure.
[20:06:48] <hemanth> kborchers: ya, had removed body tags and tired it was the same
[20:07:16] <misterm> hemanth: I mean the actual content of the response
[20:08:04] <hemanth> misterm: content response firebug is empty, it says 200OK with invalid label err
[20:09:11] <hemanth> callback needed?
[20:09:30] <misterm> hemanth: I'm not sure what you mean
[20:09:37] <misterm> hemanth: it would help if you pasted your code
[20:09:52] <misterm> hemanth: also, if the response is empty, then something is wrong
[20:11:00] <hemanth> ok pasting
[20:11:35] <drfreeze> I'm getting data with $.getJSON and am getting the data, but ihe function is returning an error
[20:11:54] <kborchers> ?demo @ drfreeze
[20:11:54] <bot-t> drfreeze, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:12:07] <drfreeze> I'm guessing I can get the errors with .error(function(err) {..}, but not sure if that's right
[20:14:00] <hemanth> http://jsfiddle.net/g3yua/
[20:15:20] <hemanth> jQuery automatically assumes the request is a JSONP request ?
[20:15:30] <drfreeze> kborchers: http://empty-galaxy-640.heroku.com/calls
[20:15:35] <kborchers> hemanth: like i said, i'm pretty sure your problem is that you are not returning JSON, you are returning HTML. You PHP script needs to add header('Content-type: application/json'); and you need to get rid of all of that HTML around your JSON
[20:15:37] <hemanth> misterm: ^
[20:16:30] <misterm> hemanth: yea, if firebug isn't working, hope into chrome and see what headers and body your response is getting
[20:16:47] <hemanth> kborchers: okies!  So <html> <head>…</head></html> and <? echo $myjson ?>
[20:17:31] <misterm> hemanth: no, your server should be sending *JUST* JSON
[20:17:33] <kborchers> hemanth: no - no html, no head, no body, just the JSON
[20:17:54] <hemanth> ^_^ ok
[20:18:50] <hemanth> did the changes now trying
[20:21:15] <kborchers> drfreeze: not sure what error you are referring to. i do see an error coming from prototype though
[20:21:56] <hemanth> misterm:  kborchers still not happening :(
[20:22:05] <drfreeze> kborchers: the success function is not being called
[20:22:24] <drfreeze> I am getting .error and .complete called, but not success
[20:23:11] <drfreeze> I'm not seeing in the docs how to get the error type when the error function is called
[20:24:35] <phantoGram> Hi all!  First time in this IRC.  Quick question -- I'm working on a website where we're using paperjs for some header content.  I'd like to load one of the paperscripts from an array of choices when the page loads.  any idea where to start?  .getScript?  or .load? or .append to the html head element maybe?  Thanks!
[20:26:14] <hemanth> callback needed?
[20:26:49] <kborchers> drfreeze: try console.log(err.status, err.statusText);
[20:27:46] <misterm> hemanth: what do you mean?
[20:28:09] <misterm> hemanth: what's happening with the actual request now? is it successful, what headers are you getting, what about content?
[20:29:00] <hemanth> headers : Content-type: application/json, response is blank; even after 200OK
[20:29:40] <drfreeze> 200 parsererror
[20:30:21] <hemanth> header('Content-type: application/json'); is what i have given
[20:31:52] <kborchers> drfreeze: it looks like your json is formatted like ["a": 1313551340] but i believe should be {"a": 1313551340}
[20:37:57] <drfreeze> kborchers: yes, that's what it was
[20:38:15] <kborchers> cool
[20:38:20] <drfreeze> How can I get access to item 'a'?
[20:38:28] <drfreeze> data.a doesn't seem to work
[20:38:48] <IgnisDiabolus> var data = {"a":12313123}; console.log(data.a);
[20:38:51] <hemanth> misterm: i'm almost there, missing something :(
[20:39:47] <drfreeze> if returns undefined
[20:39:51] <misterm> hemanth: what about in chrome, is the response blank there?
[20:40:43] <kborchers> drfreeze: can you update your link that you gave earlier to show the changes you've made so i can see that error?
[20:41:18] <kborchers> oh, i see in complete
[20:41:18] <hemanth> misterm: trying, need FireBug there or will console do it?
[20:41:35] <misterm> hemanth: using the network tab in the developer tools
[20:42:00] <letterpress> question: $.when resolves its promise at the first failure of one of its deferred objects. is there a method to wait to resolve that promise until all the deferred objects passed to it have resolved?
[20:42:21] <kborchers> drfreeze: you have data.items in your complete callback, not data.a
[20:42:25] <drfreeze> updaed
[20:42:26] <drfreeze> http://empty-galaxy-640.heroku.com/calls/new
[20:42:58] <drfreeze> [{"call":{"created_at":"2011-08-17T03:42:32Z","id":28,"number":"1111","updated_at":"2011-08-17T03:42:32Z","vote":1}},{"call":{"created_at":"2011-08-17T03:42:42Z","id":29,"number":"2222","updated_at":"2011-08-17T03:42:42Z","vote":1}}]
[20:43:00] <letterpress> should i use pipe to chain all the deferred objects in this situation?
[20:43:30] <hemanth> misterm: it says status text 200ok type : application/json so on
[20:43:44] <misterm> hemanth: yea, but what about the content
[20:44:37] <hemanth> misterm: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.h3manth.com/t.php?hacker.json. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net/ is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. !!
[20:44:56] <misterm> hemanth:of course
[20:45:04] <misterm> hemanth: I meant you should be testing in your real app
[20:45:37] <misterm> hemanth: if you need to do it cross-domain then you need JSONP, not just JSON
[20:46:31] <hemanth> misterm: so need to get the callback and append it, as $_GET['callback'].'(' echo $json .')'; okies will try
[20:47:22] <kborchers> drfreeze: you put data in the setInterval function instead of the getJSON success callback.
[20:47:32] <misterm> hemanth: if what you are trying to do is make the request cross-domain, then yes
[20:48:26] <drfreeze> kborchers: It's in the first success function of getJSON
[20:50:03] <kborchers> drfreeze: that's not what i see when i view source. i see setInterval(function(data) { then var jqxhr = $.getJSON("/calls.json", function() { you should not have data in the first anonymous function and it should be in the second
[20:53:12] <drfreeze> kborchers: duh. Not sure I would have seen that
[20:53:52] <kborchers> that's what a second set of eyes is for :)
[20:55:24] <drfreeze> kborchers: thanks
[20:55:31] <kborchers> np
[21:09:38] <Lochlan> hey guys
[21:10:03] <Lochlan> How do I reattach a detached element?
[21:10:12] <Lochlan> do I need to save the detached element as a variable?
[21:10:34] <kborchers> Lochlan: yes, then use append, insertAfter, insertBefore ... what ever
[21:10:45] <Lochlan> ok, but have to save it as a var
[21:11:31] <Lochlan> i can't just $('#element').detach() then $('#element').insertAfter
[21:11:33] <kborchers> yes, var elem = $("element").detach();  elem.appendTo("body"); for example
[21:11:53] <Lochlan> ok, thanks
[21:11:54] <jonee1> hi how do you parse a json output of .getJSON call
[21:12:01] <kborchers> Lochlan: no because #element has been detached from the dom so that selector won't find anything
[21:12:07] <Lochlan> np
[21:12:33] <Lochlan> how can I make a variable variable for the detached element?
[21:12:36] <Cork> jonee1: if the data sent is valid json, you should have a js object with you data, no parsing needed
[21:12:53] <jonee1> hmm ok thanks
[21:13:04] <kborchers> Lochlan: my example above does it ^^^
[21:13:33] <Lochlan> I need the 'elem' to be different depending on what's being detached
[21:14:25] <Lochlan> the name of elem, that is
[21:17:16] <kborchers> Lochlan: hmmm, you could store your detached elements in another object. so you could define var elems = {}; then do elems["elem1"] = $("#elem1").detach(); ... have never done it but i think that should work
[21:17:36] <Lochlan> thanks, I'll work it out
[21:19:28] <Lochlan> kborchers, i can also do: window['string'+var] = $("#elem").detach();
[21:20:51] <kborchers> Lochlan: but that makes it global ... yucky!
[21:21:18] <Lochlan> this for a web application, I need to use global vars sometimes
[21:21:34] <Lochlan> as far as i know
[21:21:57] <kborchers> there is almost always a way to avoid globals
[21:22:12] <Lochlan> hm
[21:22:18] <Lochlan> well
[21:22:24] <Lochlan> this has a series of columns
[21:22:29] <Lochlan> max 5
[21:22:34] <Lochlan> i can remove/add them whenever
[21:22:59] <Lochlan> do if i detach one, then add it, i expect it to contain all the existing data, and not repopulate
[21:23:53] <kborchers> right, that is how detach works
[21:24:06] <Lochlan> ok
[21:24:14] <Lochlan> so..
[21:24:33] <Lochlan> not sure how to do it another way
[21:24:45] <Lochlan> apart from, detach, store detached as var
[21:24:52] <Lochlan> then when i add it, uses that var
[21:26:26] <Lochlan> maybe i should just hide, show them instead
[21:26:45] <kborchers> that sounds like a much better/easier solution
[21:26:52] <Lochlan> yeah
[21:27:02] <Lochlan> i was trying to be clever, but it seems to causing more issues
[21:27:17] <kborchers> yeah ... KISS ;)
[21:28:56] <Lochlan> works a treat
[21:28:58] <Lochlan> that'll do.
[21:29:01] <kborchers> cool
[22:01:32] <luchenbill> would it be hard to make an image hover effect similar to this @ http://www.templatemonster.com/website-templates.php
[22:18:24] <apalmer> Hey, does anyone know of a good plotting library for query? I would like to use Google's chart api but my boss does not like the idea of google having our information on this project; it is very sensitive data. I've seen PlotKit which appears to be very good, but it has been a pain for me to get working, particularly with jQuery. I've also seen http://code.google.com/p/flot/, but from the example it doesn't appear to support pie ch
[22:18:24] <apalmer> Any suggestions?
[22:28:10] <hemanth> trying to getJSON, made jsonp format as needed. http://h3manth.com/t.php?str=test&callback=test seems fine? cos getJSON's response is empty
[22:29:34] <hemanth> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://h3manth.com/t.php?str=test&callback=test. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[22:29:45] <hemanth> even though i'm returning a jsonp
[22:29:57] <ryanseddon> getJSON doesn't do jsonp calls
[22:30:53] <hemanth> ryanseddon, just json?
[22:31:14] <hemanth> $.ajax() ?
[22:31:28] <danheberden> actually, ryanseddon, it does
[22:31:28] <ryanseddon> getJSON will do a an xhr request jsonp needs to loaded through a script tag
[22:31:40] <danheberden> but you have to have callback=? in the url
[22:32:10] <danheberden> but using $.ajax is by far more easy to use
[22:32:22] <ryanseddon> so use $.ajax with dataType set to jsonp
[22:32:39] <hemanth> trying
[22:32:49] <danheberden> MOAR TRYING :D
[22:35:56] <hemanth> ryanseddon, esource interpreted as script but transferred with MIME type application/json.
[22:36:01] <hemanth> header issues hrrrm
[22:37:18] <ryanseddon> thats just in chrome right?
[22:37:52] <hemanth> yes
[22:42:25] <hemanth> ryanallenbobcat, http://jsfiddle.net/gxNk5/1/ did something like this
[22:49:00] <hemanth> ryanallenbobcat, fixed :)

[22:55:11] <GoSox> Sooo I'm looking for a way to invisibly load a URL in the background, whenever a user clicks on an external link on one particular web page. The purpose of which is to count how many people click on these links. The loaded URL would be a PHP doc that would quietly add a 'hit' into an SQL database.
[23:04:35] <hemanth> is there a way to use a POST to get a JSONP response.
[23:04:37] <hemanth> ?
[23:13:07] <silv3r_m00n> when doing this form_elem.submit(function()   for a form , can I know which button was pressed for submission inside the form ?
[23:29:43] <xtc> guys, i have a problem with using transparencies (opacity animation) with html5 elements on IE (working with the HTML5 shiv script). Is this known to work at all?
[23:37:49] <GoodAD> lol
[23:38:00] <GoodAD> ubuntu = stuxnet virus
[23:57:25] <MatthiasVance> It seems that $(iframe).ready() does not fire on older IE versions (when I'm not loading a document in), but .load() works, however that doesn't work on newer browsers. Is the solution to have both handlers present? Yuck!
[23:58:04] <GoSox> so i have a <map> with #id, is there a way I can bind to each <area> within the <map> #id?
[23:58:39] <MatthiasVance> actually, .ready() fires on the older IE versions, just the DOM isn't ready yet
