[00:02:54] <Uhkis> oh, i missed that part
[00:03:09] <BenL90> Uhkis: So how?
[00:03:38] <Uhkis> you can't put an event listener to an element that does not exist
[00:04:35] <BenL90> Uhkis: So when I add #alert DIV, that things "isn't exist"? when docs done load?
[00:05:16] <Uhkis> it doesn't exist on page load, it's created when you click that remove button of yours
[00:06:24] <BenL90> Uhkis: Oh so that's the problem, Then why other code can do it, I mean some site? Like they add and remove? It requires hack on code?
[00:07:58] <JSPractice> hi. In my HTML page, there are 7 tables. I want to assign each of them a unique ID, something like table1, table2 etc.
[00:08:20] <BenL90> JSPractice: When load?
[00:08:26] <BenL90> just use counter?
[00:08:31] <JSPractice> BenL90: sure
[00:08:44] <JSPractice> BenL90: I tried, but there's something wrong with my code
[00:09:02] <BenL90> Is that come from sql or you make?
[00:09:37] <JSPractice> it's a ready website. I want to assign it an ID on the fly from the console, so i can make retrieve contents from these tables based on their IDs
[00:09:58] <BenL90> ask Uhkis for it
[00:10:38] <JSPractice> for(var i=0; i<7; i++){ 	$(".investor").attr("ID", "tabl"+i); 	continue; }
[00:10:53] <JSPractice> this is what I wrote, but all the tables get assigned the value "tabl06"
[00:11:21] <Uhkis> BenL90: read the link i gave you.
[00:12:00] <JSPractice> Uhkis: can you help me with my code? I know it's incredibly easy but i can't figure it out
[00:15:53] <Uhkis> JSPractice: http://jsfiddle.net/o7cnkzed/
[00:17:57] <JSPractice> thank you Uhkis!

[02:37:14] <drupol> Hello all,
[02:37:30] <drupol> Where can I get a list of valid characters for a jQuery selector ?
[02:41:23] <abhinav> can any1plz help me with jquery globalize 1??
[02:47:29] <Uhkis> drupol: what do you mean
[02:48:03] <drupol> Uhkis: I would like to fix a bug in Drupal core and I would like to know how to filter value that we pass to a jQuery selector properly.
[02:48:13] <drupol> Uhkis: the issue is here: https://www.drupal.org/node/2395065
[02:53:57] <Uhkis> drupol: why is there a need for the url at all?
[02:54:53] <drupol> Uhkis: so you can read the context
[02:54:58] <drupol> just FYI
[02:55:07] <BenL90> Uhkis: How to make this https://css-tricks.com/examples/EditableInvoice/ as I saw the docs that the element added after docs ready can still counting the price, I, I tried it on Mine, but it's not work when I add new row on mine, please help me. I'm newbie anyway :s I have read the api docs, but still not understand
[02:56:15] <Uhkis> drupol: in the selector i mean
[02:58:32] <drupol> Uhkis: this is for Drupal, it passes the anchor to a jQuery selector when there are errors in forms in fieldset. So the fieldset is open when the page is reloaded.
[02:59:57] <Uhkis> drupol: but that should already be covered by the error class, right?
[03:03:03] <BenL90> any can help me please, How to make this https://css-tricks.com/examples/EditableInvoice/ as I saw the docs that the element added after docs ready can still counting the price, I, I tried it on Mine, but it's not work when I add new row on mine, please help me. I'm newbie anyway :s I have read the api docs, but still not understand
[03:04:52] <drupol> Uhkis: actually, the default Drupal system is working fine as long as you do not add manually fancy characters in the anchor.
[03:06:54] <Uhkis> drupol: do you know any module that does this? hard to reproduce with a clean install
[03:06:59] <Whiskey> What is best way to update crc/md5/sha? I get the values from PHP i think and how do i get them to javascript?
[03:07:11] <drupol> Actually, it's easy to reproduce
[03:07:29] <drupol> But you need to make sure that the form you're using is in a fieldset.
[03:07:52] <drupol> Then, you must have, for example, a required field in it, and you submit the form without filling it.
[03:08:11] <drupol> Then Drupal will display a form error and the fieldset should be open.
[03:08:31] <drupol> If in your url anchor, you add some fancy characters, it will crash the JS.
[03:08:48] <drupol> And this is also explained in the very first post on the page: https://www.drupal.org/node/2395065
[03:09:02] <Uhkis> lets rephrase that: it takes a lot of time to reproduce that on a clean install
[03:09:27] <Uhkis> unless you happen to have the code for such form handy?
[03:09:57] <Uhkis> Whiskey: $.get the values from php
[03:09:58] <drupol> Let me check on a clean install, I don't know by heart.
[03:11:06] <Uhkis> drupol: fyi: drupal is my dayjob :)
[03:11:38] <drupol> Uhkis: me too
[03:13:46] <drupol> Uhkis: can't find it on a clean install, I will probably do a small module with a stupid form in a fieldset to demonstrate that.
[03:15:38] <Uhkis> drupol: i'm already on that
[03:18:22] <Xatenev> Uhkis: is drupal cool nowadays?
[03:18:42] <JSPractice> it's so cool that you guys are fixing bugs
[03:18:45] <Xatenev> I can just remember drupal from like 4years ago when I firstly touched web development when it wasnt that cool imho :o
[03:18:59] <JSPractice> it's not required of you, but you're being a good open source user/developer
[03:19:01] <Xatenev> Maybe cause I didnt understand all that yet :p
[03:19:08] <drupol> Xatenev: it's paying my bill since now 10 years :)
[03:19:15] <Xatenev> drupol: oh nice :P
[03:19:18] <Xatenev> long time heh :P
[03:19:20] <drupol> yup
[03:20:04] <Uhkis> JSPractice: :)
[03:20:50] * drupol going for food.
[03:22:26] <BenL90> hmmm
[03:23:17] <Uhkis> drupol: how am i supposed to keep that mess in the url after submit
[03:35:21] <tomred1> Is there some "magic" to allow you to attach event handlers to elements tha you dynamically add to the page via Ajax?
[03:36:06] <Uhkis> tomred1: yes
[03:36:21] <tomred1> Does it have a name :-)
[03:36:41] <Uhkis> tomred1: http://api.jquery.com/on/ direct and delegated events part
[03:37:09] <tomred1> I've been trying that without success.
[03:37:52] <hellyeah> hey
[03:38:09] <hellyeah> i created five divs dynamically but i want to show that seperately how can i do that?
[03:38:11] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/3/
[03:39:07] <Uhkis> lets assume you pull <div id="ajaxed"></div> to a <div id="content"></div> with your ajax call, for that you'd have to do $('#content').on('click', '#ajaxed', function() {});
[03:39:20] <hrusti> hellyeah: define seperately
[03:39:28] <hellyeah> a sec
[03:40:33] <Uhkis> tomred1: basically $(what_you_have_on_dom_ready).on(eventname, selector_for_element_to_be, callback)
[03:42:40] <JSPractice> Uhkis: what is a callback function or a callback URL?
[03:42:45] <tomred1> I think that's what I have. http://jsfiddle.net/Loex7d3w/
[03:43:01] <Uhkis> JSPractice: in that, function
[03:43:47] <Uhkis> tomred1: well in that your selector is wrong
[03:44:02] <Uhkis> oh wait, nvm
[03:44:28] <Uhkis> ah, you didn't select jquery for that
[03:45:00] <Uhkis> you're also not calling that function ever
[03:45:00] <tomred1> Uhkis: Can you explain?
[03:47:03] <tomred1> The function is loaded at the top, I've added it to the paste http://jsfiddle.net/Loex7d3w/2/
[03:47:05] <Uhkis> tomred1: http://jsfiddle.net/Loex7d3w/1/ now it does something
[03:49:50] <hellyeah> hrusti:  http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/12/ this is what i meant
[03:52:45] <tomred1> Uhkis: I can't see any difference!
[03:52:53] <hrusti> hellyeah: you want the gap between divs?
[03:53:04] <hrusti> use css?
[03:53:16] <hellyeah> i created five different divs
[03:53:24] <hellyeah> and i put some grap between divs yes
[03:54:20] <hrusti> hellyeah: sorry but I dont know what you want to achieve
[03:54:42] <Uhkis> tomred1: look at your console
[03:56:21] <hellyeah> hrusti:  http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/14/ i just try to create div dynamically and put this menu into each div
[03:57:49] <tomred1> i'm afriad my console isn't saying anything either
[03:58:11] <Uhkis> tomred1: http://jsfiddle.net/f4s4j437/ very concrete example
[03:59:34] <hrusti> hellyeah: I still dont know what you want to achieve, but I guess you should just store your menu in variable before loop and at the end of each loop iteration you just append it to your dynamic created div
[04:01:08] <hellyeah> yes
[04:01:16] <hellyeah> ust put menu into div
[04:01:23] <hellyeah> let me explain all stories
[04:01:33] <hellyeah> i just have big tables
[04:01:43] <hellyeah> i chunked big tables into small pieces
[04:01:59] <hellyeah> and i want to show this small piece in different divs
[04:02:07] <hellyeah> i have x small tables
[04:02:24] <tomred1> Uhkis: Ahh, you're creating the elements entirely. These elements I want the event to attach to are html fragments that I load from the server.
[04:03:29] <tomred1> I could stick an onclick on the html fragement but I thought that would be discouraged.
[04:04:20] <Uhkis> tomred1: you don't have any elements before that ajax call?
[04:04:38] <tomred1> There's a container div.
[04:05:41] <Uhkis> so that's your selector, then just add newly created element selectors to on() second argument
[04:06:10] <hellyeah> i guess i added menu to div but it doesnt appear can you help me little bit http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/15/
[04:30:04] <tomred1> Uhkis: Yes, yes, yes. Excellent. The 2nd arg can be a selector. It works. Thank you.
[04:35:28] <hellyeah> i suppose it must clone table to container but it doesnt work can you help me? http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/19/
[04:37:06] <JSPractice> hi. I need help in trying to push elements into a JSON format
[04:37:24] <JSPractice> i have all the elements i need, the keys and the values, in separate arrays
[04:37:45] <Uhkis> JSPractice: make a fiddle
[04:38:15] <JSPractice> it has to be in this format : {"Timely Receipt of": ["Annual Reports", "Dividend"], "quantitative analysis": ["other elements"] };
[04:38:28] <JSPractice> Uhkis: one sec
[04:38:56] <Uhkis> JSPractice: you have 20mins before i go afk
[04:39:21] <JSPractice> http://jsfiddle.net/9oqbeq1j/
[04:39:51] <JSPractice> the site i'm trying to get the elements from, i've pasted that as a link in the fiddle
[04:40:14] <hellyeah> pls help me little bit
[04:40:44] <taplar> hellyeah: LN 18 your appending trs inside a th
[04:41:13] <hellyeah> you mean line 17
[04:41:15] <hellyeah> ?
[04:41:22] <taplar> no
[04:41:39] <hellyeah> $tHeadth.append($thArray);
[04:41:43] <hellyeah> this one?
[04:41:46] <taplar> yes
[04:42:05] <JSPractice> Uhkis: updated. http://jsfiddle.net/9oqbeq1j/1/
[04:42:16] <hellyeah> humm,
[04:42:20] <hellyeah> i suppse
[04:42:28] <hellyeah> i need to add th to trs
[04:42:45] <taplar> th's are on the same nesting level as tds
[04:43:12] <taplar> th just has some extra formatting
[04:44:55] <hellyeah> hmm i am confused little bit
[04:45:33] <hellyeah> i added thArray to th then add to tr then add to thead then add to table
[04:45:43] <hellyeah> is it right to think like that?
[04:46:09] <taplar> 15 adds your thead to your table
[04:46:17] <taplar> 16 adds your tr to your head
[04:46:27] <taplar> 17 adds your th to your tr
[04:46:39] <taplar> 18 adds trs to your th
[04:46:54] <decx> has this been the same topic and table for 3 weeks?
[04:46:56] <taplar> your variable name is misleeding
[04:47:02] <taplar> feels like it
[04:47:06] <hellyeah> ic
[04:47:17] <decx> you better put ©#jquery on that page
[04:47:23] <taplar> lol
[04:47:25] <hellyeah> decx:  what?
[04:47:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  is there something wrong there i can have better variable names
[04:47:57] <Uhkis> decx: :D
[04:48:02] <taplar> you variable name is "thArray
[04:48:05] <taplar> "thArray"
[04:48:09] <hellyeah> ops
[04:48:11] <taplar> your selector is selecting trs
[04:48:12] <hellyeah> right
[04:48:14] <hellyeah> :D
[04:48:20] <Uhkis> JSPractice: so.. what's happening here
[04:48:34] <hellyeah> well
[04:48:37] <hellyeah> thats true
[04:48:37] <hellyeah> :D
[04:49:32] <JSPractice> Uhkis: so, first I assign my tables an ID. then i retrieve the text of the <h2> tags and store them in an array. I do the same with the td>strong tags
[04:49:45] <hellyeah> taplar:  i fixed that http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/21/
[04:49:56] <JSPractice> now I want the elements in this format : {"Timely Receipt of:": ["Annual Reports", "Dividend"], "quantitative analysis:": ["other elements"] };
[04:50:20] <taplar> your still appending trs to a th
[04:50:44] <JSPractice> where "timely reports of" and "quantitative analysis" are the <h2> elements, and the "annual reports" and "dividends" are the td>strong text
[04:50:53] <hellyeah> a sec
[04:52:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  isit correct now? http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/22/
[04:53:00] <taplar> what is it doing?
[04:54:09] <hellyeah> wholly it just adds menu to the chunks.
[04:54:21] <taplar> no, lol
[04:54:25] <taplar> the change you just did
[04:54:26] <Uhkis> JSPractice: that's kinda impossible like that because those td text amounts are not the same
[04:54:27] <taplar> what does it do now
[04:54:32] <hellyeah> ah okey
[04:55:06] <hellyeah> table tr th get th inside tr?
[04:55:17] <taplar> yes
[04:55:19] <JSPractice> Uhkis: how else do i do it?
[04:55:56] <Uhkis> JSPractice: in that each loop
[04:56:13] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes sorry i typed ? accidentally
[04:56:23] <JSPractice> Uhkis: how?
[04:56:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  with table tr th we just targetted th directly
[04:56:39] <taplar> right, so what are you doing with them
[04:56:43] <JSPractice> Uhkis: my boss told me to look at map() but i don't know how i can use that here
[04:57:33] <taplar> must be a lady boss, telling you to check out a map
[04:57:40] <taplar> jk
[04:58:33] <hellyeah> taplar:
[04:58:47] <hellyeah> i just want to put menu inside container
[04:58:55] <hellyeah> so i can have menu in each div?
[04:59:04] <taplar> again, what are you doing with them?
[04:59:43] <JSPractice> taplar: hah. i chuckled
[05:01:18] <Kartagis> JSPractice: you go to a store, and you buy a map
[05:01:24] <Kartagis> or map()
[05:01:31] <hellyeah> taplar:  i have a big tables 200 rows i chunked big tables into small one now i have 20 small tables. I want to put those tables into divs.. So i will have 20 divs with 20 tables and each divs has same header.
[05:01:44] <taplar> hellyeah, i'm not asking about the big picture
[05:01:48] <taplar> i'm asking what the code is doing
[05:01:55] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[05:02:09] <JSPractice> Kartagis: huh?
[05:02:20] <hellyeah> two things actually one i will create 5 divs with for loop
[05:02:21] <Kartagis> nvm, jk
[05:02:29] <taplar> stop!
[05:02:33] <hellyeah> me
[05:02:34] <JSPractice> Kartagis: okay. uhm, can you help me with my initial problem?
[05:02:35] <taplar> hellyeah:
[05:02:35] <hellyeah> ?
[05:02:42] <taplar> like 11, you get the ths
[05:02:48] <taplar> what, are you doing with them?
[05:02:59] <taplar> like = line
[05:04:09] <hellyeah> this is header part of table i just added to tHeadth ?
[05:04:17] <taplar> yes
[05:04:21] <taplar> what is tHeadth
[05:04:30] <Kartagis> never used map(), sorry
[05:05:00] <JSPractice> Kartagis: that's fine. i can use any method that works
[05:05:22] <JSPractice> Kartagis: i've posted the problem slightly above. if you want, i could repost it
[05:05:45] <Kartagis> do so
[05:06:21] <JSPractice> http://jsfiddle.net/9oqbeq1j/1/   so, first I assign my tables an ID. then i retrieve the text of the <h2> tags and store them in an array. I do the same with the td>strong tags
[05:06:23] <hellyeah> var $tHeadth = $("<th>"); it is just th i understand like you define table thead tr th right?
[05:06:32] <JSPractice> now I want the elements in this format : {"Timely Receipt of:": ["Annual Reports", "Dividend"], "quantitative analysis:": ["other elements"] };
[05:06:40] <JSPractice> where "timely reports of" and "quantitative analysis" are the <h2> elements, and the "annual reports" and "dividends" are the td>strong text
[05:06:43] <Uhkis> JSPractice: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/9oqbeq1j/3/
[05:06:55] <taplar> so tHeadth is a th element
[05:06:59] <hellyeah> yes
[05:07:04] <taplar> and your appending to it thArray
[05:07:22] <hellyeah> :D
[05:07:28] <taplar> see a problem?
[05:08:00] <hellyeah> sso actually i am confused about append and appendTo unfortunately lack of practice may be
[05:08:12] <hellyeah> so need to change append to appendTo in every line
[05:08:20] <taplar> both append and appendTo add content to an element
[05:08:27] <hellyeah> yes
[05:08:29] <taplar> yes
[05:08:39] <hellyeah> append x -y , appendTo y - x
[05:08:52] <taplar> yes
[05:09:19] <taplar> i think your confused about append
[05:09:23] <taplar> they're not strings
[05:09:29] <taplar> your dealing with elements
[05:09:38] <taplar> it appends INSIDE the element
[05:09:47] <taplar> the content is what's in the element
[05:10:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/23/ no result appear
[05:10:34] <taplar> x.append(y) == <x><y></x>
[05:10:36] <Uhkis> JSPractice: hope that helps, i'm afk ->
[05:10:55] <JSPractice> Uhkis: still reading it. thanks though!
[05:11:01] <JSPractice> Uhkis: appreciate it :)
[05:11:12] <hellyeah> let me take a note
[05:12:38] <taplar> append adds children
[05:13:21] <hellyeah> ic
[05:13:32] <hellyeah> $table.append($tHead);
[05:13:37] <hellyeah> so there is no problem here
[05:13:44] <hellyeah> thead is childeren of table
[05:13:46] <taplar> nope, thead is a valid child of table
[05:14:07] <hellyeah> ye
[05:14:08] <hellyeah> s
[05:14:15] <hellyeah> thead is child of table
[05:14:23] <hellyeah> thi is thing i tried to say
[05:14:23] <hellyeah> :D
[05:14:29] <taplar> keep going, what else
[05:14:47] <hellyeah> theadtr = tr is child of thead
[05:15:05] <hellyeah> tHeadth is child of theadtr
[05:15:15] <taplar> no
[05:15:22] <taplar> bad
[05:15:28] <taplar> thead is not a valid child of tr
[05:15:41] <hellyeah> th is child of tr
[05:15:51] <hellyeah> thead is child of table
[05:16:03] <taplar> <table><thead><tr><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
[05:16:15] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes
[05:16:33] <taplar> k, so now line 18
[05:16:44] <hellyeah> sorry my english is confusing sometimes
[05:16:58] <hellyeah> in line 18 you just add text to the element
[05:17:05] <taplar> no
[05:17:05] <hellyeah> so actually it is also child
[05:17:14] <hellyeah> it isnt text node?
[05:17:16] <taplar> your adding children
[05:17:30] <hellyeah> yes
[05:17:32] <taplar> children th's
[05:17:50] <taplar> your selector for thArray is a result of th objects
[05:18:10] <hellyeah> th ---> something
[05:18:22] <taplar> th elements
[05:18:26] <taplar> not just their contents
[05:19:24] <hellyeah> so append is not false there?
[05:19:41] <taplar> it'll add th's to th's all day.  doesn't mean it's valid markup
[05:19:56] <hellyeah> ic
[05:20:46] <hellyeah> what should i do for make this valid? my code is wrong or something is wrong?
[05:20:56] <taplar> what do you think you should do?
[05:21:50] <hellyeah> well i just though
[05:22:03] <hellyeah> i created table with thead section in a true order
[05:22:19] <hellyeah> i check the tag order in html part
[05:22:25] <hellyeah> so i added tag truly
[05:22:31] <taplar> huh?
[05:22:53] <taplar> your confusing me with your use of booleans
[05:23:17] <taplar> you have a table
[05:23:18] <hellyeah> <table><thead><tr><th></th></tr><thead></table>
[05:23:25] <taplar> your wanting to move those trs into a new table
[05:23:27] <hellyeah> sorry for my english
[05:23:30] <taplar> you create a new table
[05:23:34] <hellyeah> yes
[05:23:36] <taplar> you want to add it to that table
[05:23:41] <taplar> so how would you do that
[05:24:07] <hellyeah> get th of table and append to another table?
[05:24:14] <taplar> given that you have existing trs, what does your new table need?
[05:24:16] <hellyeah> th of another table?
[05:24:23] <taplar> why do you need the ths?
[05:24:42] <hellyeah> th is the last node of thead?
[05:24:49] <hellyeah> leaf node
[05:24:55] <taplar> if you select at the th level, you'll lose your tr context from the original table
[05:25:02] <hellyeah> you have to traverse tree from up to buttom?
[05:25:23] <hellyeah> so
[05:25:31] <hellyeah> do i need to use jquery selector?
[05:25:46] <taplar> yes
[05:25:53] <hellyeah> humm
[05:25:57] <hellyeah> like child()
[05:25:59] <taplar> no
[05:26:04] <hellyeah> next()
[05:26:25] <taplar> why do you need to traverse anything?
[05:26:35] <taplar> taking trs from one table, putting them in another
[05:26:55] <hellyeah> homm
[05:27:01] <hellyeah> let me check
[05:28:14] <hellyeah> taplar:  did you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/24/
[05:28:39] <taplar> closer, but now your appending trs to trs
[05:28:48] <taplar> remember, adds children
[05:28:50] <taplar> not siblings
[05:29:07] <hellyeah> trs to trs
[05:29:09] <hellyeah> humm
[05:29:10] <hellyeah> so
[05:29:19] <hellyeah> humm
[05:29:22] <hellyeah> ic know
[05:29:25] <hellyeah> now*
[05:29:33] <hellyeah> thanks for support and patience god bless you
[05:29:37] <taplar> np
[05:30:01] <hellyeah> tr is childeren of thead
[05:30:07] <hellyeah> and append add childeren
[05:30:08] <hellyeah> humm
[05:30:21] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/25/
[05:30:22] <taplar> so if you want your trs to be children of thead you need to....
[05:30:32] <hellyeah> add to tHead
[05:30:34] <taplar> hey!
[05:30:36] <taplar> :)
[05:30:51] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:30:57] <hellyeah> :)
[05:31:27] <hellyeah> now i understand append
[05:31:30] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:31:49] <hellyeah> actually hmm
[05:31:53] <hellyeah> i understood wrongly
[05:31:58] <hellyeah> now i am clear on that
[05:32:35] <taplar> now for another thing
[05:32:39] <taplar> why do you need your loop?
[05:32:41] <hellyeah> sure
[05:32:46] <hellyeah> ah okey
[05:33:01] <hellyeah> i have a big tables
[05:33:11] <hellyeah> i chunked big table into small parts
[05:33:12] <taplar> no i mean for the current case in your fiddle
[05:33:17] <taplar> what's it doing for you
[05:33:32] <hellyeah> a sec
[05:34:10] <hellyeah> i try to create divs dynamically see http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/26/
[05:34:49] <taplar> hellyeah: that's fine, but as far as moving your trs, for what you have right now, the loop is unnecessary
[05:34:50] <hellyeah> i will chunk table into small pieces by (10) for example when i have 200 rows i will have 200 small tables
[05:34:55] <taplar> or atleast having the tr move in it is
[05:35:07] <hellyeah> 20 small tables
[05:35:15] <hellyeah> taplar:  i realized that
[05:35:28] <hellyeah> i just want to put those header to each div
[05:35:42] <hellyeah> i am using clone() function for that purpose
[05:35:50] <hellyeah> i will move those line outside for
[05:36:21] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/27/
[05:36:44] <taplar> move the table append and show outside too
[05:39:38] <hellyeah> ops righr
[05:40:33] <hellyeah> yes
[05:40:35] <hellyeah> now
[05:41:07] <hellyeah> $container.append($('<div>').addClass('part')); this line add class part to the table container is just div i created in html part
[05:41:55] <hellyeah> $(".chunks").append($table); i added table to the chunks now table is child of chunks
[05:42:24] <taplar> yup
[05:43:01] <hellyeah> $container = $(".chunks").clone(true); so this line should clone everyting (contain content of chunks because i use true parameter of clone)
[05:43:06] <hellyeah> correct?
[05:44:12] <hellyeah> am i wrong?
[05:44:21] <taplar> hold on, i'm fiddling
[05:47:34] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/28/ <-- cleaned up and reduced your code a bit
[05:50:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:50:32] <hellyeah> how can i show header part of table in each div?
[05:50:47] <taplar> you'll need to create multiple tables
[05:50:52] <taplar> each with the head
[05:51:11] <taplar> so start with that
[05:51:23] <taplar> first create the number of tables you want, each with the head
[05:51:35] <hellyeah> var $newTable = $('<table class="newTable"><thead></thead></table>'); so within for loop
[05:51:51] <taplar> play around, see what you come up with first, :)
[05:51:57] <hellyeah> sure
[05:52:02] <hellyeah> can i ask later?
[05:52:10] <taplar> no!  lol, yes, always
[05:52:15] <hellyeah> thank yu :D
[05:52:28] <hellyeah> btw do you preer to create id dynamically?
[05:52:45] <hellyeah> when i create dynamically should that have spesific id
[05:52:55] <hellyeah> because next
[05:52:57] <hellyeah> i try to do
[05:53:08] <hellyeah> create a button and bind table to a button
[05:53:14] <taplar> you could create dynamic ids, sure
[05:53:23] <hellyeah> like i have 5 divs not
[05:53:27] <hellyeah> i will have 5 button
[05:53:39] <hellyeah> when you click each button they will show one related div
[05:53:43] <hellyeah> humm
[05:53:49] <hellyeah> so much work to do thanks
[05:53:54] <taplar> we'll talk about that later, first, get your tables :)
[05:53:54] <hellyeah> i will dig it up bit
[05:54:01] <taplar> small steps
[05:54:01] <hellyeah> sure thanks
[05:54:11] <hellyeah> yes there is a saying that
[05:54:31] <hellyeah> before passing first part of stairs
[05:54:36] <hellyeah> you can go tenth !
[05:54:43] <hellyeah> i dont know how to properly said
[05:54:57] <taplar> hmm
[05:55:26] <hellyeah> may be you dont understand anyway
[05:55:49] <taplar> heh, too much lost in translation perhaps
[05:55:56] <hellyeah> probably
[05:56:03] <hellyeah> and my english is not really good anyway
[05:56:17] <hellyeah> i will think about this may be i can meantion it properly later
[05:56:29] <taplar> k
[06:15:49] <Herehere> How can I get the certain element by class If I have div with nested elements?
[06:16:17] <Herehere> $(".employee_input a span span.spanClass"
[06:16:46] <Herehere> would this works? $(".employee_input").find('.spanClass')?
[06:17:00] <taplar_afk> sure
[06:17:28] <Herehere> thx
[06:17:49] <taplar> or just do both in the first selector
[06:18:03] <taplar> ".employee_input .spanClass"
[06:18:10] <Herehere> nice
[06:22:31] <xvure> ".employee_input .spanClass" will apply to all spanClass elements nested under the employee_input; to target only those directly under it use $('.employee_input > .spanClass')
[06:22:51] <Herehere> xvure: good to know
[06:23:10] <Herehere> but not for me for now :P
[06:25:17] <Herehere> Is it correct way to put elements in the variable?
[06:25:21] <Herehere> window.employee_input = $(".employee_input ul:first-child div");
[06:25:32] <Herehere> then
[06:25:41] <Herehere> employee_input.text()
[06:25:58] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/33/ i am not sure why there is five small line above header. Is it correct to do like that? taplar if you have time
[06:27:00] <xvure> @hellyeah - the elements above the header are empty instances of .newTable
[06:28:04] <xvure> You have your newTable creation within your loop so it will create it for each repetition; however any further manipulation will only apply to the last instance
[06:28:17] <hellyeah> ic
[06:28:53] <hellyeah> xvure:  humm
[06:29:06] <hellyeah> i will assume it will apply in each for loop
[06:29:28] <hellyeah> any advice to avoid that?
[06:32:24] <xvure> @hellyeah - Just so I understand what you're trying to do; you're attempting to create 5 tables, with $existingTrs applied to each of them?
[06:32:49] <hellyeah> yes
[06:32:57] <xvure> Okay two seconds
[06:33:01] <hellyeah> i need to have five menus
[06:33:04] <hellyeah> headers*
[06:33:24] <hellyeah> i just want to create five table with five headers
[06:33:26] <taplar> existingTrs will only exist in the last table
[06:33:36] <taplar> you'll have to clone it if you want them in all the tables
[06:33:49] <hellyeah> humm
[06:34:05] <taplar> appending an existing dom element is the same as moving it
[06:34:21] <hellyeah> humm
[06:34:30] <hellyeah> ic
[06:36:03] <newbie> sorry
[06:36:18] <slainr> hey, guys, I've to do an web app for mobile, but I'm kinda newbie and I was thinking to use jQuery and Boostrap for that.  My web app should look like this > http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8uXEo5D3zX0/T2dm1887KYI/AAAAAAAADBo/y90bYiM-S08/s1600/FunkyBoutique.png
[06:36:44] <hellyeah> sorry
[06:36:47] <hellyeah> i disconnected
[06:37:58] <hellyeah> taplar:  if i understand you truely you are talking about using clone instead of append right
[06:38:06] <hellyeah> clone().append()
[06:38:16] <taplar> appending the clone
[06:38:18] <hellyeah> ?_
[06:38:41] <taplar> $(selector).append(X) becomes $(selector).append(X.clone())
[06:38:46] <xvure> hell yeah - you must consider a two step process, fist create the tables, and then spend $existingTrs
[06:38:49] <xvure> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/34/
[06:40:53] <taplar> no need really for the each http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/35/
[06:40:57] <hellyeah> sorry i disconnected
[06:41:13] <taplar> or re-wrapping the existing trs element
[06:44:07] <hellyeah> $newTable, $('.newTable') these are same variable right?
[06:44:25] <taplar> the second is the collection of all of them
[06:45:26] <xvure> $newTable is the singular, $('.newTable') is targeting all with the class
[06:45:35] <taplar> but given the direction your wanting to go in, better to do it all in a single loop
[06:45:45] <xvure> taper - was just a quick throw together while slacking off bugfixing ;)
[06:46:53] <hellyeah> actually this one is better
[06:46:58] <taplar> slainr: not sure what your question is
[06:47:07] <hellyeah> because i have put newTable inside container
[06:47:22] <taplar> hellyeah: your wanting to break the table up into pieces.  if you did your header last, it would be at the bottom of each table
[06:47:44] <hellyeah> humm
[06:47:55] <taplar> unless you use prepend instead
[06:47:59] <taplar> that could work
[06:48:51] <taplar> bah, actually doesn't matter, your header would be in your thead, not your tbody
[06:48:59] <hellyeah> what is clone(true, true) just one parameter is not enough=
[06:49:23] <hellyeah> ?
[06:50:43] <taplar> if I recall correctly additional parameters force it to do additional coping of things like event handlers and other stuff
[06:50:51] <taplar> have to look at the api for more
[06:51:23] <hellyeah> https://api.jquery.com/clone/
[06:51:26] <hellyeah> read that already
[06:51:33] <hellyeah> i didnt see true, true
[06:51:51] <xvure> https://api.jquery.com/clone/#clone-withDataAndEvents-deepWithDataAndEvents
[06:52:04] <xvure> the second param will also clone handlers of child elements
[06:52:12] <hellyeah> humm ic
[06:53:57] <hellyeah> btw i dont undersstand why there is no vertical line between text
[06:54:24] <taplar> huh?
[06:55:06] <hellyeah> you see timeslice url right
[06:55:42] <hellyeah> nevermind question
[06:55:49] <hellyeah> taplar:  you were right btw http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/39/
[06:56:28] <hellyeah> at the buttom of container
[06:57:01] <taplar> um, not really what i was talking about
[06:57:09] <hellyeah> humm
[06:57:23] <taplar> anyway, keep playing.  make those tables!
[06:58:04] <taplar> and btw, with the multiple tables, why do you need the divs?
[06:58:56] <hellyeah> actually i dont need div
[06:59:01] <hellyeah> it is just for study
[06:59:29] <hellyeah> but may be i need to get rid of div http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/40/
[07:04:08] <fitzilla> hey. I've been working off some exisitng code, and modified it
[07:04:13] <fitzilla> https://jsfiddle.net/8wKxY/256/
[07:04:17] <fitzilla> existing*
[07:04:31] <fitzilla> toggle needs to be pressed twice though, for it to hide a sidebar
[07:04:38] <fitzilla> on load, that is.
[07:06:21] <xvure> fitzilla, it's because it's already open, but you do not have data-name="show" applied to the sidebar at that point
[07:07:17] <hellyeah> sorry i asked many question but why there is no boder here
[07:07:21] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/43/
[07:10:38] <xvure> hellyeah, you can just add css to the th elements (and obviously the td elements if needed)
[07:12:09] <fitzilla> oops xvure, i'd removed it.
[07:12:34] <xvure> Also questions are no problem at all hellyeah, everyone has to start at some point and questions show that you are learning
[07:12:51] <fitzilla> xvure. cheers!
[07:12:51] <hellyeah> thank you
[07:13:51] <hellyeah> yeha
[07:13:57] <xvure> No problem fitzilla
[07:14:10] <hellyeah> xvure:  http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/45/
[07:14:22] <hellyeah> does it seem correct to do like that?
[07:14:49] <hellyeah> i styled inline
[07:15:26] <fitzilla> xvure, what would be the best way to reverse it so the sidebar is hidden by default ? then opened on click instead ?
[07:15:55] <CocoStorm> Hi guys, I have a .each function going on and in it I'm using $(this).attr("row") to get the current row of the table and doing $(myDiv).find(row= row).show() to display it.  That works but I need to display it in desc order based on the value of the data i.e $(this).text() which is a number.  Is this possible?
[07:16:17] <CocoStorm> How do I do this?
[07:16:36] <xvure> hellyeah, either/or works, down to personal preference
[07:19:02] <hellyeah> xvure:
[07:19:07] <hellyeah> seperation of concerns?
[07:19:23] <hellyeah> newTable is just variable you didnt get anything
[07:19:33] <hellyeah> i dont know how to style jquery variable in css
[07:19:39] <hellyeah> is there a way to do that?
[07:20:11] <xvure> fitzilla, could just set #map to 100% width, #sidebar to 0% to begin with
[07:20:31] <xvure> hell yeah, just heading into a meeting I'll get back to you in  a few minutes
[07:20:31] <fitzilla> xvure, ah through css. but then does jquery need to reverse too ?
[07:20:41] <hellyeah> sure thanks xvure
[07:21:01] <hellyeah> now
[07:21:06] <xvure> fitzilla, not at all, you won't have the data attrib applied to begin with, so it's no further changes are needed
[07:21:07] <hellyeah> the only thing i need to
[07:21:15] <hellyeah> tbody tr part of table
[07:21:22] <hellyeah> and put it under header
[07:21:26] <fitzilla> xvure, thanks again.
[07:21:28] <hellyeah> i will se about that
[07:21:36] <hellyeah> then bind to a button
[07:21:47] <hellyeah> also i have to create dynamic button
[07:21:59] <CocoStorm> Hi guys, I have a .each function going on and in it I'm using $(this).attr("row") to get the current row of the table and doing $(myDiv).find(row= row).show() to display it.  That works but I need to display it in desc order based on the value of the data i.e $(this).text() which is a number.  Is this possible?
[07:22:16] <fitzilla> xvure, https://jsfiddle.net/8wKxY/260/ and i changed this to data-name="hide"
[07:22:35] <fitzilla> xvure, does what it should.
[07:27:39] <decx> where's that row attribute coming from cocostorm?
[07:28:44] <CocoStorm> decx: coming from a div element
[07:29:17] <decx> that's not valid then
[07:34:58] <xvure> CocoStorm, can you link a jsfiddle example
[07:46:07] <hellyeah> xvure:
[07:46:12] <hellyeah> jsfiddle or jsbin_
[07:48:04] <xvure> Hmm odd bug in IE9; if you unbind $(this), it will null all instances of $(this), regardless of scope
[07:49:57] <hellyeah> i have to work with i.e8
[07:50:05] <hellyeah> it probably will become nightmare
[07:50:13] <hellyeah> it is not easy to write such simple stuff
[07:50:28] <hellyeah> i am sure this is simple yor you xvure , taplar_afk
[07:50:38] <hellyeah> i am carious
[07:50:46] <hellyeah> if i use jquery 1.10.1
[07:50:55] <hellyeah> my script will be convenient for i.e.8
[07:51:05] <hellyeah> 1.10.1 has old i.e. sstuff
[07:51:15] <hellyeah> also someone suggest me to use es5-shim
[07:51:40] <hellyeah> this two things save the day some fols said
[07:51:43] <hellyeah> are you agree_
[07:53:50] <hellyeah> $newTable.attr("tr:style = border", "1px solid blac"); is legit?
[08:11:15] <NoiseEee> hellyeah: you should be using .css to set styles
[08:11:51] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/css/ @ hellyeah
[08:11:55] <decx> even so that attr doesnt make sense
[08:13:27] <hellyeah> NoiseEee:  i used two ways here http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/46/
[08:34:35] <robertmaxrees> what a morning.
[08:34:36] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[08:44:06] <NoiseEee> yeesh++
[08:45:14] <decx> so you've read #jquery all morning in bed robertmaxrees? ^^
[08:45:46] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha.
[08:45:47] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[08:45:55] <robertmaxrees> been interesting in here, too?
[08:45:58] <decx> hellyeah was on fire with the old table ^^
[09:02:32] <xvure> The sweet, sweet feeling of hitting 0 open tickets on redmine...
[09:03:01] <decx> still gotta use redmine so, so it's bittersweet at least
[09:03:17] <xvure> Too true
[09:35:39] <tehopeologist> hi all, i'm trying to force 1024px width with a viewport meta tag and it doesn't seem to be working properly
[09:36:01] <tehopeologist> tried talking in #html, but it says i can't for some reason.  i'm identified and everything *shrug*
[09:36:58] <robertmaxrees> 1024px width for the content area?
[09:37:17] <robertmaxrees> why not use CSS?
[09:37:21] <tehopeologist> yeah, trying to force the window to think it's viewing in 1024
[09:37:37] <tehopeologist> instead of the smaller width the window actually is
[09:38:07] <robertmaxrees> then use CSS.
[09:38:14] <tehopeologist> i'm trying to not have to use a class for my non-responsive stuff
[09:38:37] <tehopeologist> i'm using min-width for styling for mobile-first, and i have a cookie that flags if you want responsive or not
[09:38:55] <tehopeologist> when you don't want it, i'm trying to make the viewport width think it's 1024 so the mobile-first styling doesn't apply
[09:39:11] <tehopeologist> i have my desktop styling >= 1024px
[09:39:23] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15040408/achieving-min-width-with-viewport-meta-tag
[09:39:34] <robertmaxrees> if this still doesn't help, make sure you actually are auth'd and ask in #html.
[09:39:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:40:32] <tehopeologist> i'm authed by nickserv and it still says i cannot send in #html
[09:42:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple-check that.  because you should be able to send if you're recognized.
[09:46:06] <tehopeologist> [11:45] -NickServ- You are already logged in as tehOPEologist.
[09:46:38] <tehOPEologist> that didn't do anything either
[09:46:40] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[09:46:41] <tehOPEologist> argh owell
[09:54:43] <starsync> why the fuck does irssi give me random highlights sometimes? ;_;
[09:55:05] <starsync> tehOPEologist: apparently your nick == mine
[09:55:19] <tehOPEologist> wat
[09:55:26] <starsync> idk :< annoying bug
[09:55:37] <tehOPEologist> how does that even
[09:55:44] <tehOPEologist> lol owell
[09:56:19] <starsync> :-P
[10:00:26] <cconstable> I'm not sure if this is js or jquery related but I have a click() handler that is not being invoked... simplified example: http://jsfiddle.net/st89u44o/1/ any thoughts?
[10:00:32] <cconstable> line 17 is the line in question
[10:21:13] <cconstable> [solved] needed to use bind(). newb js mistake :)
[10:38:57] <Emn1ty> So, I'm having a fun issue that I'm not sure how to fix. I have a dialog window with a datepicker inside it. But everytime I try and click a <select> element in the datepicker, it focuses a checkbox in the dialog beneath it instead.
[10:39:17] <Emn1ty> this happens in firefox only
[10:49:18] <skinux> Anyone have experience with jQuery-Multi-Purpose-Popup-Modal-Plugin-popModal ??
[10:49:38] <Zzaichik> sounds like a duplicate id/for combination Emn1ty
[10:50:15] <skinux> I've tried doing $.modal and $("#content").notifyModal as well as $("#content").popModal....they all return error that the functions don't exist.
[10:51:05] <Emn1ty> no duplicate id's
[10:51:38] <Emn1ty> Zzaichik: I'll attempt to recreate the issue in a fiddle if I can
[11:03:42] <skinux> I'd like some help with how to get this Modal plugin to work, as well as figure out why my spreadsheet component is showing. http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/vn5zwfp6/1/
[11:06:14] <cannap> Uncaught TypeError: $.modal is not a function
[11:10:10] <cannap> @skinux http://jsfiddle.net/vn5zwfp6/2/
[11:12:12] <skinux> And I guess that tells me that the spreadsheet isn't being given any data...?
[11:12:48] <cannap> i dont know what you want show in this
[11:13:15] <cannap> its only the html what is in the #speadsheet
[11:13:16] <cannap> but now its empty
[11:19:28] <dan_j> Hi. I have one <main> tag in my HTML. Any idea why this doesnt work?
[11:19:33] <dan_j> var BottomOfMain = $('main:last').offset().top + $('main:last').offset().height;
[11:20:25] <jdo_dk> Today i do code like this: https://dpaste.de/TAPX i have looked at underscorejs, but can i do some similar with plain jquery ? (im thinking of a template with placeholders or is there a template plugin for jquery?)
[11:22:35] <skinux> Now I'm getting element.addEventListener is not a function for line 60 http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/vn5zwfp6/3/
[11:24:22] <shoky> dan_j:  what's .offset().height ?
[11:25:25] <dan_j> http://imgbin.org/index.php?page=image&id=25025
[11:25:35] <dan_j> It's ok. I've managed to do it without jquery
[11:26:33] <shoky> there's no .offset().height anyways
[11:46:09] <throstur> Hey guys, how do I select "all <tr> elements that have a <td class='foo'> and contains(this text)" ? I tried $("tr > td.foo:contains(thistext)") but it gives me the td elements
[11:58:18] <shoky> throstur: you can add .closest('tr')  to get the <tr>s
[11:58:48] <throstur> it worked with parent, just tried it
[11:58:51] <throstur> thanks :)
[12:05:51] <shudon> hi all :) i'm developing a Chrome extension and i was thinking about using jQuery. i recall that jQuery has a feature to avoid conflict over window.$, but what about conflicting with other jQueries?
[12:55:30] <Robdgreat> shudon: is there a good reason you couldn't check first to see if there's another jquery and only load it if there isn't?
[12:55:54] <Robdgreat> just a shot in the dark on my part, but no one else was answering
[12:56:07] <robertmaxrees> don't load multiple versions to begin with.
[12:57:53] <robertmaxrees> redefine the problem (boom)
[13:01:54] <hlvwrk> o_o
[13:03:14] <skinux> element.addEventListener is not a function for line 60 http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/vn5zwfp6/3/ please assist
[13:04:26] <robertmaxrees> you sure that's the right code?
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're passing something to a plugin it doesn't expect.
[13:05:56] <robertmaxrees> Handsontable.Dom.addEvent(autosave, 'click', function() { - this is what's erroring.
[13:39:54] <coderfromcincy> how can i find out if the user clicked a checkbox inside a <tr> if the event listener is on the <tr> because they can click anywhere on the row to check the respective checkbox
[13:40:11] <isthisreallife> https://dpaste.de/Q1t7  how to get smooth fadeIn/fadeOut img when clicking '.single-box'? could someone help me with code?
[13:40:14] <robertmaxrees> check the event.target, coderfromcincy
[13:40:20] <coderfromcincy> $(document).on("click",".row:not(:checkbox)",function(){ isn't working
[13:40:34] <coderfromcincy> robert its returning the tr event with event.target
[13:40:41] <coderfromcincy> even*
[13:40:41] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle, coderfromcincy
[13:40:56] <skinux> robertmaxrees: I know that is where the error is, what I don't know is why it's an error.
[13:41:09] <skinux> I had it fixed, but somehow the code got reverted.
[13:41:26] <coderfromcincy> its like its bubbling the event
[13:41:29] <robertmaxrees> skinux i don't know handsontable or waht it even is - i'd look for a support channel/forum for them.
[13:41:38] <coderfromcincy> should I had stopPropagation?
[13:41:41] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy well, i mean, yeah.  that's how most events work.
[13:41:44] <skinux> Handsontable is a spreadsheet component
[13:42:07] <coderfromcincy> should I add stopPropagation?
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy you can add a e.stopPropagation(); to a listener for clicks on the checkbox.
[13:42:23] <skinux> The problem was solved before just by modifying the JS I've posted. The library itself isn't the problem.
[13:42:27] <coderfromcincy> thats what i figured.. let me try that
[13:42:51] <robertmaxrees> skinux great - since it's another lib it's hard to know.
[13:43:05] <robertmaxrees> skinux i'd see if they have a support forum or something :)
[13:43:10] <skinux> Although, I'm actually considering just developing the spreadsheet portion of the app (which actually is the core of the app) in JavaFX.
[13:43:35] <skinux> Actually, the version I'm using is a jQuery plugin
[13:43:52] <robertmaxrees> skinux right - and datatables can be used as a jquery plugin.
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean that anybody here knows anything about it :)
[13:44:23] <skinux> Well, it was someone from this channel who helped me a few days ago and made it work.
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> skinux i'm just trying to help you get support as fast as possible, that's all.
[13:44:46] <skinux> Understood.
[13:44:49] <robertmaxrees> this channel may very well have nobody in it right now that can help.
[13:45:52] <skinux> Appears the only support available has to be paid for.

[13:50:03] <coderfromcincy> robert
[13:50:04] <coderfromcincy> you still there
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:50:32] <coderfromcincy> http://jsfiddle.net/vqjyxm2x/
[13:52:21] <coderfromcincy> stops the box from being checked
[13:52:44] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to make it so clicking the tr checks the box?
[13:53:04] <coderfromcincy> yes
[13:53:13] <coderfromcincy> but also the checkbox can be clicked as well
[13:53:16] <coderfromcincy> its like its double clicking it
[13:54:18] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees is there a cleaner way to do this code? http://jsfiddle.net/b9opdvnf/6/
[13:54:41] <hlvwrk> i mean it works, but it would be nice to do that if switch when I'm initially setting the var
[13:54:46] <hlvwrk> it just seems messy.
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy you don't need JS for this.
[13:55:39] <coderfromcincy> well its being handled in an external js file
[13:55:47] <coderfromcincy> in the function
[13:55:54] <coderfromcincy> so kind of want it to be..
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?want
[13:56:06] <robertmaxrees> *you want this done via markup
[13:57:15] <coderfromcincy> nevermind.. what do you have in mind
[13:57:18] <hlvwrk> nvm I got it
[13:57:18] <hlvwrk> ;o
[13:58:10] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vqjyxm2x/1/
[13:58:36] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk .attr('Info') isn't really valid.
[13:58:41] <robertmaxrees> info isn't a valid attribute.
[13:58:41] <hlvwrk> i know
[13:58:59] <hlvwrk> i had to change my actual code, which was a model.get that wouldn't work in jsfiddle
[13:58:59] <robertmaxrees> and your var declaration in that if is invalid.
[13:58:59] <hlvwrk> lol
[13:59:30] <hlvwrk> so I had to rewrite it to *function* the way I was referring to
[13:59:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b9opdvnf/7/
[13:59:38] <robertmaxrees> just do this.
[13:59:54] <robertmaxrees> destinationStatus = $('#destinationPath').html() || 'path not here';
[14:00:30] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy you just wrap your inputs in label tags and then, in this case, set the label to be display: block;
[14:00:31] <coderfromcincy> robert
[14:00:35] <coderfromcincy> thats a single td solution
[14:00:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:00:42] <coderfromcincy> my row has 10 tds
[14:00:47] <robertmaxrees> that will work, too.
[14:00:50] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees, the actual code; var statusPath = model.get('statusPath');
[14:00:57] <hlvwrk> changed that to; var statusPath = model.get('statusPath') ? model.get('statusPath') : '',
[14:01:13] <coderfromcincy> but the checkbox is in the first td
[14:01:13] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk var statusPath = model.get('statusPath') || '',
[14:01:15] <robertmaxrees> does the same.
[14:01:23] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy why are you using a table, then?
[14:01:31] <coderfromcincy> because its a grid
[14:01:31] <hlvwrk> ah. || '' is the jQuery equivalent?
[14:01:37] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk that's javascript.
[14:01:40] <hlvwrk> o_O
[14:01:57] <hlvwrk> My bad ;P
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy okay.  so you still need a way to change the checkbox on click of the row.
[14:02:20] <coderfromcincy> yes
[14:02:28] <coderfromcincy> see why i was using closest?
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> do you already have a listener on the checkbox, then?
[14:02:31] <coderfromcincy> in jquery
[14:02:44] <coderfromcincy> yes because once its changed its added to an array
[14:02:47] <coderfromcincy> if its checked
[14:03:01] <robertmaxrees> so first off, don't use click as your listener on the checkbox, use change.
[14:03:15] <coderfromcincy> im not
[14:03:26] <coderfromcincy> its $(document).on("change",".plancheckbox",function(){
[14:04:03] <robertmaxrees> move that a little lower than document if you can.  and the easiest way to do this is to then add an event handler for clicks to the checkbox that runs e.stopPropagation();
[14:04:43] <coderfromcincy> robert i do document because its a table thats added dynamically through ajax post request
[14:04:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd still go lower than document, but okay.
[14:04:54] <coderfromcincy> you saying use body?
[14:05:01] <coderfromcincy> or the parent div?
[14:05:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying to use the parent container that you're appending it to.
[14:05:08] <coderfromcincy> ok
[14:05:29] <snover> goodbye friends
[14:05:39] <hlvwrk> HE WAS SO YOUNG :(
[14:05:49] <hlvwrk> so many lives lost that cold day in #Freenode
[14:05:54] <hlvwrk> er #jQuery ;)
[14:06:05] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees, you still here?
[14:06:17] <coderfromcincy> robert does it really matter if i use document?
[14:06:28] <robertmaxrees> it's cleaner if you don't.
[14:06:32] <coderfromcincy> im using exclusive classes on the event listeners
[14:06:34] <robertmaxrees> feel free to not change that though.
[14:06:48] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees.... does this work? var statusPath = model.get('statusPath') || 'model.get('statusError')' || '';
[14:06:52] <coderfromcincy> i mean i probably will before final release but i want this issue fixed
[14:06:52] <hlvwrk> can you have it fallback three times?
[14:07:12] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy then fix it?
[14:07:13] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic.
[14:08:03] <robertmaxrees> like - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vqjyxm2x/2/
[14:08:37] <coderfromcincy> yeah man thats it.. thanks
[14:08:42] <coderfromcincy> good job
[14:08:47] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[14:08:48] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees is a jquery king.
[14:08:56] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what i did there?
[14:08:57] <hlvwrk> that's what I heard.
[14:09:10] <robertmaxrees> totally not the jquery king
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> but hey, i'll take it ;)
[14:09:48] <hlvwrk> I heard shoky was a king once.
[14:09:49] <hlvwrk> :)
[14:09:53] <robertmaxrees> still is imo.
[14:09:57] <hlvwrk> oh for sure
[14:10:01] <hlvwrk> I wasn't sure if he still spoke in here :P
[14:10:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah he does.
[14:10:10] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees you can || more than once in the function, right?
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk huh?
[14:10:20] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[14:10:21] <hlvwrk> var statusPath = model.get('statusPath') || 'model.get('statusError')' || '';
[14:10:24] <hlvwrk> no?
[14:10:26] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[14:10:32] <hlvwrk> erm
[14:10:34] <hlvwrk> alright
[14:10:40] <robertmaxrees> use vars.
[14:11:06] <coderfromcincy> robert i know what you did
[14:11:07] <hlvwrk> ah true. I could just do the same || '' to the statusError
[14:11:10] <robertmaxrees> var statusPath = model.get('statusPath') || '', statusError = model.get('statusError') || '';
[14:11:20] <robertmaxrees> and then a third for whatever you actually need
[14:11:22] <hlvwrk> gotcha
[14:11:24] <hlvwrk> thanks
[14:11:27] <coderfromcincy> you basically took the checkbox completely out of the equation from the event listener
[14:11:34] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy sort of, yeah.
[14:11:53] <robertmaxrees> there are ways to do that without the extra event listener, but i'll leave you to figure that one out ;)
[14:11:55] <coderfromcincy> its a good solution ive actually done something like that before but i was too deep in thought to see that
[14:12:14] <coderfromcincy> yeah i just need a quick and dirty and that was it
[14:12:16] <coderfromcincy> thanks again
[14:12:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:22:47] <shudon> Robdgreat: thanks for the reply :) i have no reason i cannot check for another jquery, but i'd like to write for a single version of jquery, and not try to have my application just use whatever version of jquery happens to be used by another webpage :3
[14:23:03] <robertmaxrees> shudon is this for a plugin or something?
[14:23:06] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[14:23:07] <shudon> robertmaxrees: yes
[14:23:17] <robertmaxrees> then you can dictate a minimum version to support.
[14:24:11] <shudon> robertmaxrees: maybe so. but what if the version available on the page is not sufficient? how do i get access to another version of jquery without interfering with the page's jquery?
[14:24:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> they upgrade.
[14:24:29] <shudon> ah. well, that is not an option. i will have to come up with something else
[14:24:33] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:24:48] <shudon> i can't tell other webmasters to upgrade their jquery for my plugin :\
[14:24:53] <robertmaxrees> yes you can.
[14:24:56] <robertmaxrees> that's really common.
[14:25:11] <shudon> maybe i miscommunicate... it is not, say, a wordpress plugin or something. it is a browser plugin/addon/extension
[14:25:21] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's what you're doing.
[14:25:26] <shudon> mm
[14:25:35] <shudon> mmhm*
[14:26:09] <robertmaxrees> then always load your own version and namespace it using noconflict.
[14:26:12] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use native JS.
[14:26:20] <robertmaxrees> which is actually pretty easy to do for the most party.
[14:26:22] <robertmaxrees> *part
[14:26:50] <shudon> ahh
[14:27:02] <shudon> this is what i thought i remembered about
[14:27:03] <shudon> noconflict
[14:27:51] <shudon> but noconflict i think only is about the $ variable
[14:28:00] <shudon> not two assignments to the jQuery variable
[14:30:04] <shudon> is there maybe a build of jquery that uses commonjs modules or similar feature to avoid the namespace/variable-name contention?
[14:30:30] <robertmaxrees> supports amd
[14:30:59] <shudon> what's amd?
[14:31:08] * shudon googles
[14:31:16] <robertmaxrees> i think it's amd at least - module loading setup.
[14:32:19] <shudon> one website says Asynchronous Module Definition (http://tomdale.net/2012/01/amd-is-not-the-answer/)
[14:32:59] <robertmaxrees> nvm jquery uses requirejs
[14:33:05] <kadamwhite> amd == requirejs
[14:33:08] <shudon> commonjs.org seems to be down or have gone away
[14:33:15] <kadamwhite> requirejs is a tool designed to allow the use of AMD modules
[14:33:32] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's right.
[14:33:49] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, jquery supports modules out of the box.  go to the repo and learn :)
[14:34:15] <shudon> thanks guys :)
[14:34:18] <kadamwhite> If you're using Browserify, you can use a tool called deamdify to include jQuery's component modules directly from a commonJS environment
[14:34:33] <robertmaxrees> he's building a browser plugin fwiw.
[14:34:51] <shoky> jquery has commonjs support too iirc
[14:34:55] <kadamwhite> oh cool :) Not sure in that case. but good luck!
[14:35:10] <shudon> i am not using commonjs modules for this project, but i do want something like it so that i can avoid interfering with the operation of the page that the end-user is using the browser extension upon
[14:35:30] <shudon> actually i'm not using anything yet, i just started this project
[15:10:57] <goodenough> i want to put focus to an input element, is $('inputClass').focus() correct?
[15:13:54] <shoky> 'inputClass' ?
[15:15:44] <goodenough> $('.search-bar--header input')
[15:15:51] <goodenough> thats my selector actually
[15:16:02] <shoky> if the selector is correct, then yes
[15:19:34] <Whiskey> How do i change the data in here class="dataViewBox-Data"><pre class="toggleable Text"> and add text from an URL insted of whats in it now?

[15:26:22] <Whiskey> No thats not what i written?
[15:26:33] <Whiskey> and add text from an URL insted of whats in it now?
[15:26:46] <Whiskey> lets say its get text from http://google.se
[15:26:52] <Whiskey> well content maybe batter word
[15:29:29] <bastones> Whiskey: I am sorry but you aren't making much sense. I wish I could be of more help.
[15:30:15] <bastones> It is not clear what you want to do inside "<pre class="toggleable Text">...</pre>".
[15:30:32] <Whiskey> what is it you don´t get?
[15:30:54] <Whiskey> Its is a text there now, and lets say its some other text on http://www.google.com how do i change the text from whats in it to whats on google.com?
[15:31:33] <bastones> Oh, I see. You want to pull the content from a page and output it into <pre class="toggleable Text">...</pre>?
[15:31:41] <Whiskey> yeh
[15:32:46] <Whiskey> well that was easy
[15:32:55] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/29e17gqd/1/ :D
[15:32:59] <bastones> As long as the page is on the same domain, you can use $.post()
[15:33:14] <bastones> yes, or $.get()
[15:34:05] <Whiskey> how do you select all the way in
[15:34:14] <bastones> load() is another option too; http://api.jquery.com/load/
[15:34:47] <Whiskey> whit other words 0->dataViewBox-Data->toggleable->Text
[15:34:51] <Whiskey> to make sure it not come wrong
[15:35:58] <Whiskey> or can it only select one thing at a time
[15:36:17] <bastones> $('#0 > .toggleable.Text > span').text(result); << this what you looking for?
[15:36:33] <bastones> This outputs the content of the page into <span>...</span>
[15:36:56] <Whiskey> awsome
[15:37:23] <bastones> Has that helped?
[15:37:44] <Whiskey> yeh thanks
[15:37:51] <bastones> Glad to have got there in the end ;-)
[15:38:56] <Whiskey> But think i go whit load insted :)
[15:51:03] <Whiskey> bastones?
[15:51:24] <skinux> Checkboxes have event listeners right?
[15:52:07] <bastones> Whisky: Whatever is best.
[15:53:26] <Whiskey> I got a small problem
[15:53:51] <bastones> skinux: .click() works on checkboxes. You can then check whether it's selected with if($('#checkbox').is(':checked')) etc.
[15:53:54] <Whiskey> is it possible to insert that text in a span that don´t exist from js?
[15:54:18] <bastones> Whisky: You can dynamically add a <span> using jQuery if you want.
[15:54:44] <Whiskey> how do you do that?
[15:55:42] <bastones> Whisky: Not tested, but try something like this: $('.toggleable.Text').append('<span>' + result + '</span>');
[15:57:06] <Whiskey> bastones: but i use $( "#0 > .toggleable.Text" ).load( "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/znc/znc/master/.appveyor.yml" )
[15:59:54] <bastones> Whisky: Use .get(), and then within the callback function, execute the .append() stuff.
[16:02:36] <bastones> load() does the same as get() but outputs the HTML returned by the request into the matched element
[16:03:52] <bastones> meaning you don't need to create a callback function when you use .load(). it makes the assumption that the matched element (e.g. $('.matchedElement').load(...)) is what you want the HTML to be placed into
[16:04:00] <Whiskey> $('#0 > .toggleable.Text').text('<span>' + result + '</span>'); <-- did not work
[16:04:23] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/29e17gqd/2/
[16:04:41] <Whiskey> well works fine whit append do
[16:05:43] <bastones> if you want to replace everything within .toggle.Text, use .html() instead of .text()
[16:05:46] <Whiskey> the text need to be removed
[16:05:51] <bastones> if you want to "append" stuff to what is already there, use .append()
[16:05:52] <Whiskey> its fine
[16:06:34] <Whiskey> how?
[16:06:47] <bastones> $('#0 > pre.toggleable.Text').html('<span>' + result + '</span>') <-- that's what you want to do, right?
[16:07:16] <bastones> this will replace anything that already exists within <pre class="toggleable Text">...</pre> with the stuff in .html( ... )
[16:07:29] <Whiskey> yeh that will work
[16:07:33] <Whiskey> thanks
[16:08:29] <bastones> append() does much the same thing but "adds" the extra stuff to the end of what is already in <pre>...</pre>
[18:10:09] <Whiskey> Any around?

[18:50:36] <Sal> can someone help please
[21:46:42] <lenswipee> is there an equivalent of a PHP include() or require() in jquery as would like to include a functions-jQuery.js script, which will provide basic javascript functions to other scripts.
[21:47:27] <Uhkis> just use basic script tag
[21:48:14] <lenswipee> how does script A communicate with script B?
[21:48:49] <lenswipee> It's all assembled in the same scope?
[21:48:57] <Uhkis> it's the same as they would be written in the same script
[21:50:03] <lenswipee> they are separate js files. one would be functions-jQuery.js and other front-page.js for example
[22:17:34] <lenswipee> Hi, can't get simple dialog to work. please see https://jsfiddle.net/e89tezLf/1/
[22:19:19] <Uhkis> lenswipee: https://jsfiddle.net/e89tezLf/2/ you didn't have jquery ui in that fiddle
[22:20:14] <lenswipee> Uhkis: but i still don't see a dialog open
[22:21:29] <Uhkis> works fine here
[22:22:13] <lenswipee> Uhkis: What browser you using?
[22:23:23] <Uhkis> firefox
[22:25:25] <lenswipee> works in chrome too
[22:25:30] <lenswipee> bloody IE!
[22:25:44] <Uhkis> use 1.x jquery
[22:39:46] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:45:35] <Uhkis> mornin
[23:02:43] <lenswipee> script A: test(); | script B: function test(){alert("Hello World");} <-- doesn't work i think i'm doing something wrong
[23:04:15] <Uhkis> lenswipee: did you include script b before script a?
[23:04:28] <lenswipee> Yes
[23:04:46] <lenswipee> I can see the script tag is listed right
[23:13:50] <hellyeah> morning
[23:18:03] <beasty> morning hellyeah
[23:18:15] <hellyeah> beasty:  sup
[23:18:49] <beasty> nothing much just arrived at work

[23:44:14] <hellyeah> anyone around
[23:44:57] <nodist> yeah
[23:47:05] <hellyeah> a sec
[23:50:05] <hellyeah> nodist:  i try to chunk the table i  did it succesfully and i try to put into container. I can put header succesfully but it puts body of table 14 times. How can i avoid this? http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/53/
[23:52:41] <nodist> so you just want one table?
[23:55:35] <hellyeah> there are 15 headers
[23:55:56] <hellyeah> i just chunked table into small pieces by 10
[23:56:12] <hellyeah> it gives the whole table under the header
[23:56:26] <hellyeah> i suppose to get small table that is chunked
