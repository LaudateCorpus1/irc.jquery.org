[08:16:21] <D1nger> |13:15:37| <woodrag> after loading a div through an ajax call some buttons which are triggered by a class don't work anymore..... // did you use $('.myButton').myEvent(function handler() {}); ? if so, you need to delegate the event listening to a higher container: $('body').on('myEvent', '.myButton', function handler() {});

[17:50:24] <stan_man_can> Is there any way to make like a block of text I can use as a template?
[17:51:00] <stan_man_can> aka, say I have <div class="site">[site-name]</div> can I re-use that same block and drop in values?
[18:28:29] <shoky> stan_man_can: generally you'd want to use a templating solution.. there are tons.  but for that example you can also just do  var $template = $('<div class="site">');   var $newSite = $template.clone().text(site-name);   or whatever
