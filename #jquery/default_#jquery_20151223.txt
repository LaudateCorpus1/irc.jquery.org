[01:07:55] <CAP9474> hola a todos
[01:10:14] <TheWhiteHat> alguien habla español?
[02:03:28] <DexDeadly> hello
[02:18:18] <DexDeadly> anyone able to assist me with something
[02:53:54] <printForever> I have a dillema
[02:54:03] <printForever> nothing sexual
[02:54:21] <printForever> anyway... I need to toggle div visibility based on the click
[02:54:36] <printForever> thats easy, just tie toggle on the ID and it works
[02:54:52] <slax0r> and when you do have a sexual dillema, I hope you will not be asking about it here
[02:55:09] <printForever> well... you know... time will tell, I like you guys here slax0r
[02:55:26] <slax0r> then I hope I will not be around
[02:55:35] <printForever> anyway, I have this problem because I'm not sure should I put IF before .ON click or after
[02:55:38] <slax0r> so, back to your jquery
[02:55:50] <slax0r> what IF?
[02:56:03] <printForever> its a nested UL > LI > UL > LI... thing
[02:56:18] <printForever> well if ul > li > a has a sibiling UL
[02:56:31] <printForever> and then toggle that sibiling
[02:56:49] <printForever> so... should I first use IF statement to check if there is such a thing
[02:57:05] <printForever> or first use .on click and then check if A which is clicked has a sibiling
[02:57:48] <slax0r> sif you put if before the .on, then it means it will bind the event only if there is such an element
[02:58:02] <printForever> yeah
[02:58:06] <printForever> thats what I thought
[02:58:14] <slax0r> if you put if inside .on definition, then jquery will try to bind the even if it exists or not
[02:58:30] <slax0r> but if it exists, then you don't need an extra if in it, do you?
[02:58:33] <slax0r> or am I missing something?
[02:58:47] <slax0r> or is the selector in the IF not the same one as in the ON?
[02:59:03] <slax0r> regardless, I would still put the IF inside the ON
[02:59:09] <printForever> yeah, thats exactly it
[02:59:19] <slax0r> it's better readability, and makes more sense
[02:59:25] <printForever> hm... ok
[02:59:39] <slax0r> and that 1ms you save because of an extra if in the event is micro optimization
[03:00:00] <slax0r> just my 2c
[03:02:01] <printForever> well...
[03:02:07] <printForever> now the sexual preference dillema
[03:02:13] <printForever> rofl
[03:02:17] <slax0r> and on that note, I'm out of here :P
[03:03:06] <printForever> I don't know... I would still put IF before .ON
[03:03:46] <printForever> I will try both
[03:04:46] <slax0r> just keep in mind, that if you put the IF before the ON, and you later convert the ON to a delegated bind(or what's it called), your dinamically created elements will not be bound either :)
[03:05:06] <printForever> agh... you're right
[03:05:42] <printForever> btw. how should I write the IF?
[03:06:00] <slax0r> if ($(selector).length > 0) ?
[03:06:03] <printForever> if ( $(this + ul))?
[03:06:12] <slax0r> oh inside this
[03:06:26] <slax0r> erm, $(this).find(selector).length > 0
[03:06:45] <slax0r> but hey, I'm no JS expert, even less jQ ^^
[03:06:49] <slax0r> I'm a backend dev :P
[03:06:49] <printForever> I thought I could use sibiling to check if it exitsts
[03:07:18] <slax0r> hrm, don't think you can combine this and other CSS selectors
[03:08:05] <printForever> yes you can
[03:08:45] <slax0r> really?
[03:08:52] <slax0r> you learn something new every day ^^
[03:08:54] <printForever> yeah...
[03:09:04] <printForever> $(this, "")
[03:09:16] <slax0r> wut? :D
[03:09:21] <slax0r> that's cool
[03:09:26] <slax0r> I always did $(this).find() then
[03:09:53] <printForever> :)
[03:10:19] <printForever> but in my case I can't use it
[04:15:55] <hellyeah> for button, which event is more suitable. Hover or mouseover
[04:17:43] <hellyeah> it seems for button i can use mouseover
[04:19:10] <rn10950> I am getting an odd alert box with what seems to be a JS function in the dialog. It appears to be a bug with jQuery
[04:20:12] <rn10950> and TypeError: this.each is not a function
[04:20:19] <rn10950> in the console
[04:37:15] <AnGe7> hey o/
[04:37:48] <AnGe7> someone know how to make xmlHttpRequest on cross domain with internet explorer ?
[05:04:31] <eMBee> is there a way i can simplify $($(this).find("td")[0]).text(); ?
[05:13:21] <Uhkis> $(this).find('td').eq(0).text() perhaps
[05:14:19] <Uhkis> $(this).find('td:first-child').text() should work too
[05:24:25] <eMBee> Uhkis: thanks, i'll try that, unfortunately first-child won't help much as i'll need second and third, etc as well...
[05:24:52] <eMBee> but eq() might work
[06:26:29] <hellyeah> hey i got this error Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) but file is there my jsfiddle is  http://jsfiddle.net/73qe0unf/18/ can you help me t figure out why it happened?
[06:31:04] <slax0r> because the server responded with a 404
[06:31:09] <slax0r> fix your server side
[06:31:15] <slax0r> and I believe you pasted the wrong fiddle
[06:32:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:34:08] <hellyeah> slax0r: but file is there
[06:34:09] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/73qe0unf/20/
[06:40:03] <hellyeah> pls someone help me
[07:21:30] <Rinthe> http://sorgalla.com/lity/ can someone help me out with this plugin?
[07:22:29] <Ragnar> Is there a way to get the names of all events configured for an element?
[07:22:36] <Ragnar> the events with event handlers
[07:23:20] <taplar> Ragnar:for debuging?
[07:23:29] <Ragnar> taplar: yeah
[07:23:42] <Ragnar> trying to see which events I have to remove, but I'm not sure which ones this third party library are setting
[07:23:56] <taplar> trying to remember the format of it
[07:24:44] <taplar> console.log( $._data( jQueryObject, "events" ) );
[07:25:11] <taplar> actually the first element may need to be the raw Element
[07:25:19] <taplar> but you get the gist
[07:28:09] <Ragnar> taplar: when you say the first element, you mean the first argument?
[07:28:17] <taplar> yeah
[07:34:12] <Rinthe> anyone know why this isn't working? http://pastebin.com/gQKn4k96 I'm using this plugin: http://sorgalla.com/lity/
[07:34:37] <taplar> make a fiddle
[07:34:59] <Ragnar> taplar: that worked, thanks dude! :)
[07:35:05] <taplar> cool
[07:39:18] <Ragnar> turns out it was just a click event :P
[07:40:14] <taplar> just be aware that will only show events bound using jquery
[07:40:23] <taplar> any events bound with vanilla js it's not going to show you
[07:40:29] <Ragnar> that's exactly what I needed
[08:03:52] <blob__33> hi, can anyone recommend a JS code beautifier?
[08:21:15] <hellyeah> taplar: do you know jquery ui tooltip?
[08:21:23] <taplar> i know of it
[08:23:22] <hellyeah> i want to make tooltip that show full name of button when you mouserover button. Can you take a look  http://jsfiddle.net/73qe0unf/21/
[08:24:14] <taplar> i believe there is an option with tooltip to specify how it shows.  on click, on hover, etc
[08:24:17] <taplar> you should look at the docs
[08:25:39] <hellyeah> it seems there is no event for mouserover
[08:26:13] <taplar> that's hover
[08:26:26] <hellyeah> hover and mopuserover
[08:26:34] <hellyeah> hover didnt work for button
[08:29:42] <taplar> hmm, was pretty sure it had it built in.
[08:29:57] <taplar> if not you can always bind on hover and manually show it
[08:31:10] <hellyeah> it seems mouserover do the same job doesnt it? http://jsfiddle.net/73qe0unf/21/
[08:32:07] <taplar> don't do that
[08:32:16] <taplar> your trying to initialize the tooltip on every mouseover
[08:32:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:32:39] <hellyeah> why not?
[08:32:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:32:52] <hellyeah> just a sec let me try to explain my thing
[08:33:09] <hellyeah> my manager asked me to show not full name of button just 20 characters + ...
[08:33:23] <hellyeah> when you hover the button he wants to see all name of button
[08:33:33] <hellyeah> button name can be 50 chars max
[08:33:44] <hellyeah> why should i do that?
[08:33:59] <taplar> why would you have a button that is 50 char long?
[08:34:38] <hellyeah> it is service name
[08:34:47] <taplar> the name of a button should tell you what it does
[08:34:49] <hellyeah> actually i dont have any idea about that
[08:35:02] <taplar> 50 chars seems like your trying to put too much information on it
[08:35:26] <taplar> "Save", "Reset", "View Data", "View Table Data"
[08:35:32] <taplar> they tell you what the button does
[08:35:36] <hellyeah> well it will show the table when you click it of some service
[08:35:42] <taplar> "Show Table"
[08:35:43] <hellyeah> i guess he want to use whole name
[08:36:02] <hellyeah> that can be 50 chars long :XD
[08:36:06] <taplar> "Show Details"
[08:36:10] <taplar> "Expand"
[08:36:31] <hellyeah> taplar: i can understand you we are in same direction
[08:36:46] <hellyeah> when i insist him that may not be good
[08:36:55] <hellyeah> he insisted doing like that and heis manager
[08:37:09] <taplar> What's an example of a button name you have right now?
[08:39:14] <hellyeah> taplar: can be this for example Prod : Integro Md125-3-msekadn-@@operatinaldatawarehouse
[08:39:24] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/73qe0unf/23/
[08:39:40] <hellyeah> he just wants to see 20 chars + ...
[08:39:59] <taplar> are there other buttons that will begin with "Prod"
[08:40:07] <hellyeah> Prod or Test
[08:40:25] <hellyeah> Prod = Production environment Test = Test Environment
[08:41:05] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/73qe0unf/24/
[08:43:57] <hellyeah> taplar: what about this http://jsfiddle.net/73qe0unf/25/
[08:44:46] <taplar> unless there is a space constraint i'd just show it
[08:45:46] <hellyeah> brb
[09:02:57] <prestorium> hi. I'm doing a $(sel).keyup(fn), but when I hit F5, the page won't refresh. I have to click outside my element to refresh the page. Is there a way to tell the browser to bypass my function on some keys?
[09:03:36] <prestorium> fn looks like if (event.which != 13 || event.which != 116) stuff; . The enter key is working fine
[09:05:33] <taplar> that's if seems bad
[09:05:42] <taplar> i think you want &&
[09:05:58] <taplar> because 13 would fail the first condition, but pass the second, and vise versa
[09:39:56] <hellyeah> hey
[09:40:18] <hellyeah> taplar: you are not suggesting mouseover for that http://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/48/
[09:41:38] <taplar> not if you have the space to just show it
[09:42:46] <hellyeah> i plan to show it in different div like dialog boxes if it is possible and it is enough wise to do it
[09:43:27] <hellyeah> it is the example https://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[09:44:36] <taplar> right.  but my point is typically the use case for a tooltip is to present additional information about an element that would take up too much space otherwise
[09:44:44] <taplar> if you have the space, just show it
[09:45:02] <taplar> but in both cases, the element should have some clear indication of what it does
[09:45:16] <taplar> if you have to use a tooltip to know what something does, that's kinda bad
[09:45:19] <hellyeah> i understand
[09:45:26] <hellyeah> taplar: ic
[09:45:51] <hellyeah> i see the point why iit is not logical
[09:46:00] <hellyeah> actually tooltip is not working here
[09:46:29] <taplar> ln 60-62 is still initializing the tooltip on every mouse over
[09:46:30] <taplar> that's bad
[09:46:43] <taplar> you initialize once and then show/hide it
[09:49:13] <Dannyboy84> does anyone know any jquery code to auto press yes when a dialog box appears?
[09:49:50] <taplar> Dannyboy84: you can logically select it and click() or trigger('click') it
[09:49:59] <taplar> or call the click handler logic directly
[09:50:32] <taplar> that is if your not talking about an old school dialog()
[09:50:45] <taplar> or prompt, whatever it is/was
[09:50:48] <Dannyboy84> I am talking about the default chrome dialog box you get
[09:51:04] <hellyeah> did you mwan that taplar http://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/50/
[09:52:42] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/51/
[09:53:42] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[09:53:50] <hellyeah> may be i am blind what did you change?
[09:53:57] <taplar> hover over one of the buttons
[09:54:17] <hellyeah> ic
[09:54:20] <hellyeah> how it worked
[09:54:32] <hellyeah> but i dont understand what did you change :o
[09:54:43] <taplar> look at the jqueryui example and hover over the input
[09:55:03] <taplar> look in the html of that example and find were the tooltip text is coming from
[09:56:20] <Dannyboy84> taplar, I cant find the code for the dialog box on the page source
[09:56:35] <Dannyboy84> it will be javascript code wont it?
[09:56:43] <Dannyboy84> it appears when I click a button
[09:56:47] <hellyeah> brb
[09:56:52] <taplar> that would be js then most likely
[09:56:58] <taplar> unless its like a download prompt
[09:57:19] <Dannyboy84> is it possible the website author could hide the code
[09:57:53] <taplar> is the prompt like this? https://jsfiddle.net/97kbwj6x/
[09:57:59] <taplar> in appearance
[09:58:09] <Dannyboy84> yes, but it has a yes or no button
[09:58:17] <taplar> i'm not sure that you can automate that
[09:58:27] <Dannyboy84> sorry I mean an ok or cancel button
[09:58:29] <taplar> like old style alert() that's in the browsers realm
[09:58:46] <taplar> allowing js to choose the option could be considered a security thing
[09:58:58] <Dannyboy84> so I would have to use something like ahk
[09:59:01] <taplar> but i could be wrong
[09:59:02] <Dannyboy84> to press enter
[09:59:24] <taplar> possibly
[09:59:40] <Dannyboy84> ah sounds messy
[10:27:02] <jagst3r15> Hi I have this code in a function called changeInterface: http://pastebin.com/yPTXeYiG
[10:27:25] <jagst3r15> however, when the page loads there is a 2-3 second delay before the logo jumps into the middle of the navigation
[10:27:28] <jagst3r15> any way to avoid that?
[10:29:00] <NoiseEee> jagst3r15: can't see anything that should take much time there, try profiling
[10:31:18] <jagst3r15> NoiseEee 1.2ms
[10:31:25] <jagst3r15> for that function
[10:31:48] <jagst3r15> I think
[10:37:48] <NoiseEee> so thats not the issue obviously then jagst3r15 :)
[10:39:54] <jagst3r15> NoiseEee when I move the script to load in the header it doesn't even move the logo at all
[10:40:08] <jagst3r15> is it because the page hasn't loaded yet?
[10:40:30] <NoiseEee> jagst3r15: presumably yes;  you should be using a dom-ready function and your JS should be before </body>
[10:40:37] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 also
[10:45:43] <jagst3r15> NoiseEee I made some adjustments and don't see any errors in the console...any idea what is wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/02Bcre0Z
[10:45:54] <jagst3r15> loading it in the head and I tried to add a document.ready
[10:46:53] <NoiseEee> jquery itself isn't loaded yet i'd presume?
[10:46:55] <taplar> i forget, is that a scope issue?  the function is defined in the ready
[10:46:55] <NoiseEee> is that beforehand?
[10:47:14] <NoiseEee> oh that probably too taplar
[10:47:29] <taplar> put your window resize binding in the ready
[10:48:08] <taplar> and fwiw you don't have to wrap that in an anon function
[10:48:21] <taplar> resize(changeInterface); will do it
[11:08:01] <ABM_Dan> Say I have a plugin that supports events, and I plug a custom function to one of those events, inside of that function, can I call the default event?
[11:21:03] <taplar> ABM_Dan:the default event?
[11:21:26] <ABM_Dan> yeah, say I have a plugin that runs an ajax request
[11:21:53] <ABM_Dan> on success I run options.onSuccess
[11:22:37] <ABM_Dan> an in $.fn.myPlugin.defaults I have onSuccess: function(data) {...}
[11:22:58] <taplar> ah
[11:23:19] <taplar> dunno, you might be able to reference that default object inside your options.onSuccess
[11:23:34] <taplar> probably varies depending on how the plugin is built
[11:23:43] <ABM_Dan> if I go .myPlugin({'onSuccess':function(data){ doSomeStuff(); ...
[11:23:56] <ABM_Dan> Can I then call the default version of onSuccess?
[11:24:15] <taplar> best i can say is probably
[11:24:30] <taplar> in some cases you may not have to
[11:24:42] <taplar> it may execute both
[11:25:51] <ScottG_> How do I find documentation for a specific version. I've googled for a good 10 minutes with no luck...
[11:26:02] <taplar> of what plugin?
[11:26:19] <taplar> oh, sorry, different person
[11:26:23] <taplar> but yeah, of what?
[11:26:28] <ScottG_> 1.4.2
[11:26:49] <ScottG_> I want to know what the docs on getJSON were for that version
[11:27:25] <taplar> I'm not sure if version specific docs exist.  But the docs do say what version they were added in.
[11:27:54] <Guest57925> Is there something like a support lifecycle for the different jQuery versions?
[11:29:54] <shoky> no?
[11:30:31] <shoky> maybe specific companies doing commercial support have something like that.. you'd have to ask them
[11:32:18] <shoky> unless you mean browser support :S
[11:32:43] <shoky> in which case.. https://jquery.com/browser-support/
[11:33:43] <Guest57925> shoky: no, it's for our internal "security audit"
[11:35:46] <shoky> well.. support lifecycles only apply to commercial support.. no?
[11:36:33] <taplar> not sure how support lifecycle relates to security audit.  i mean, you could have the latest and greatest and it could be, security wise, broken all to hell
[11:36:36] <Guest57925> shoky: not at all, many open source projects have release cycles and support spans (debian, apache, typo3, ... on all levels really :-) )
[11:37:06] <Guest57925> taplar: Yes, but a software that is out of it's support cycle is not likely to get security updates anymore
[11:37:21] <taplar> ok?  but are there security issues?
[11:37:25] <taplar> that's your concern
[12:27:27] <Toerkeium> hello everyone
[12:28:17] <taplar_lunch> hola
[12:29:43] <Toerkeium> I have a <td>Some Text to make click <button /></td> in a html page. I have an click event which triggers an action over the <td> element, and I want to add a click event to the button, but it triggers the TD click event when I click on the button. Is there any way to make the click even over the button only and not trigger the td element click event? I can't change the html schema
[12:29:50] <Toerkeium> Hola taplar_lunch, como va?
[12:30:22] <taplar_lunch> you'll need to stopPropagation on the event for the button
[12:30:44] <Toerkeium> I'm googling that taplar_lunch, thank you!
[12:30:55] <taplar_lunch> event.stopPropagation()
[12:33:05] <jagst3r15> so I have the jQuery loading before this script in the head, but the logo still doesn't get injected into the middle of the ul until about 2-3 seconds after so it looks odd: http://pastebin.com/6nL7wxx5
[12:33:11] <jagst3r15> anything I'm doing wrong?
[12:34:05] <Toerkeium> hmm it's not working taplar_lunch, any idea?
[12:37:22] <taplar_lunch> Toerkeium: https://jsfiddle.net/h42058j6/
[12:38:41] <Toerkeium> how do you see the logs on that webpage?
[12:38:55] <taplar_lunch> right click on the page, inspect page, click the console tag
[12:38:57] <taplar_lunch> *tab
[12:39:03] <Toerkeium> oh, damn
[12:39:05] <Toerkeium> sorry
[12:39:53] <rn10950|away> I keep getting |TypeError: this.each is not a function| using jQuery without any plugins. What can I do to fix this?
[12:40:16] <taplar> rn10950:need to see what your trying
[12:40:42] <Toerkeium> perfect taplar!
[12:40:45] <taplar> it's probably that the 'this' is not a jQuery object
[12:40:57] <Toerkeium> I was doing $("#id").click(function() {});
[12:41:06] <Toerkeium> it doesn't work that way
[12:41:13] <Toerkeium> great!
[12:41:22] <taplar> Toerkeium:it will in some browsers, but you should always pass in the event if your going to use it
[12:42:12] <Toerkeium> I'll modify some more code
[12:42:17] <Toerkeium> thanks a lot
[12:42:44] <rn10950> taplar: http://pastebin.com/jDguitpq
[12:42:45] <jagst3r15> anyone have any idea?
[12:43:15] <taplar> rn10950:val() is a method
[12:43:49] <rn10950> oh... i'm stupid
[12:44:03] <taplar> and change $( "#CUS_0" ).attr("value", textArea); to $( "#CUS_0" ).val(textArea);
[12:44:11] <NoiseEee> jagst3r15: check out https://developer.chrome.com/devtools and read about how to find out whats taking time on pages
[12:45:22] <rn10950> taplar: OK. That had me for hours last night. Yet another reason not to write code at 4AM
[12:45:36] <taplar> and technically you don't have to do $( "#TA_0" ).val;
[12:45:41] <taplar> this.value would get you the same thing
[12:45:45] <taplar> in that scenario
[12:46:17] <taplar> one less dom lookup
[12:46:26] <rn10950> taplar: that's what I had originally, but I kept getting an error, so I put that there as a debug measure and didn't change it back yet
[13:03:52] <huck5> I have a <select> list in jquery mobile. While inspecting the element and changing the value of the dropdown, I noticed that none of the <option>s ever get a "selected" property... How can I get the value of this select list?
[13:05:12] <robertmaxrees> like you would with any other select.
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> .val()
[13:05:18] <ExtraSteve> huck5: like $('#select').val() ?
[13:05:38] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be getting the selected option ever - just get the val() of the dropdown.
[13:06:00] <ExtraSteve> ^^
[13:06:40] <ExtraSteve> If you're looking for the stuff inside of <option></option> then you gotta do something like $('#select option:selected').text() I think
[13:06:55] <robertmaxrees> but you really shouldn't need to do that.
[13:07:01] <robertmaxrees> the val should have the value.
[13:07:19] <ExtraSteve> If you do need to do that, you've probably designed something poorly
[13:07:46] <ExtraSteve> Since you control both what is in the value="" and inside the <option> tags - there's no need to get the text
[13:07:54] <ExtraSteve> Since you've got that data in your backend (likely)
[13:08:00] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[13:08:17] <ExtraSteve> But we don't always have that luxury.. sometimes it's someone else's crappy code that we're stuck editing :p
[13:08:30] <robertmaxrees> sure, but then you should focus on fixing the problem.
[13:08:36] <ExtraSteve> ^^
[13:08:40] <ExtraSteve> Not duct taping it
[13:08:46] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[13:29:00] <stan_man_can_> I'm a little confused with how to use .on() ... I have some checkboxes and a button that are all dynamically added to a page, I need to make it so if the user clicks on one of these check boxes, I change an attr on the button...
[13:29:42] <robertmaxrees> you're probably not using the delegated syntax.
[13:30:12] <robertmaxrees> you're probably doing something like $('thebutton').on('click', function() {});. right?
[13:30:23] <stan_man_can_> j$("button#Process").on('click', 'input[type="checkbox"]', function(){});
[13:30:40] <robertmaxrees> that's why - the checkbox isn't a child of the button.
[13:30:48] <stan_man_can_> which is probably totally wrong but like I said kinda confused
[13:30:49] <stan_man_can_> Ah
[13:30:50] <robertmaxrees> also, "button#Process" is redundant - just do "#Process"
[13:30:59] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: True.dat.
[13:31:01] <robertmaxrees> the basic syntax is $('parent').on('event
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> err, $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[13:31:43] <stan_man_can_> so I have to find the parent of both elements?
[13:31:53] <robertmaxrees> one that exists on pageload, yes.
[13:32:01] <stan_man_can_> $(body)
[13:32:09] <robertmaxrees> avoid body if possible.
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> bind further down to somewhere more contextually relevant.
[13:33:34] <huck5> robertmaxrees, ExtraSteve, thanks (for select list .val();). I thought I'd tried that, but apparently not. Works great.
[13:33:45] <robertmaxrees> huck5 fsho duder
[13:34:27] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: Alright think I found it
[13:35:38] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[13:36:16] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: So if an element is dynamically added then it's not going to be available for normal selection
[13:36:17] <stan_man_can_> ?
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> errr, it is.
[13:36:54] <robertmaxrees> but you can't select something that doesn't exist.
[13:36:55] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> this has everything you'd want to know.
[13:38:03] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ is another good resource.
[13:40:35] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[13:40:39] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[13:47:06] <jeffreylevesque> which is preferred es6, or commonjs?
[13:47:26] <jeffreylevesque> regarding `require()` equivalent logic
[13:47:28] <DeltaHeavy> It's debated but I'm pretty strongly ES6 over CommonJS.
[13:47:36] <jeffreylevesque> ok
[13:47:52] <DeltaHeavy> Look into JSPM if you want to use ES6 import/export syntax.
[13:47:57] <DeltaHeavy> Great tool
[13:48:00] <robertmaxrees> no real reason for commonjs in environments that support ES6.
[13:48:26] <jeffreylevesque> and i use browserfiy/ babelify
[13:48:30] <jeffreylevesque> so it compiles down anyways
[13:48:45] <robertmaxrees> sure, just depends on what you're doing.
[13:48:46] <jeffreylevesque> when es6 becomes the standard, then i will already have it
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> ES6 probably makes much more sense long term.
[13:49:14] <DeltaHeavy> Agree'd
[13:49:45] <robertmaxrees> or ES2015 if you want to use the new name.
[13:50:19] <jeffreylevesque> so, on line 37 I have an export statement - https://bpaste.net/show/93009c2199a6. Does the syntax agree with the corresponding `require()` with line 15 - https://bpaste.net/show/ad3c59c648fb?
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque ask in ##javascript :)
[13:50:34] <jeffreylevesque> or should i inlcude the file extension?
[13:54:36] <rfr_> that processes CC info from a form and if there is a donation to our site 'TipAmount' processes executes a payWithStripe function. The form worked up until and hour ago when I went live and changed my API keys. However by line 51 'TipAmount' has apparently fallen out of scope because the conditional if (TipAmount > 1) {  does not execute thus making the form not process the donation through stripe.
[13:55:03] <rfr_> Help would be greatly appreciated. Going crazy.
[13:55:20] <robertmaxrees> rfr_ you didn't link any code ;)
[13:55:43] <rfr_> opps http://pastebin.com/QTXu8Etn
[13:56:07] <robertmaxrees> so where's the issue?
[13:56:39] <rfr_> TipAmount seems to fall out of scope around line 51.
[13:56:46] <robertmaxrees> "fall out of scope"???
[13:56:52] <robertmaxrees> things don't "fall out of scope"
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> in fact, all of these vars are global.
[13:57:09] <robertmaxrees> which is a little scary.
[13:57:16] <rfr_> TipAmount loses it's value. Sorry that's perl speak.
[13:57:30] <robertmaxrees> "loses its value" and is set to 0?
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> and use console.log(), not alert.
[13:58:01] <rfr_> if (TipAmount > 1) {  does not execute
[13:58:18] <robertmaxrees> if (NFGtoken.substring(0, 4) === '1234') does though?
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> add a console.log() right before that conditional for TipAmount
[13:59:54] <rfr_> robertmaxrees: Originally set to zero but at line 19 is set to other amount from form which it displays correctly in the alert at line 21.
[14:00:17] <robertmaxrees> i can read your code, but because these are all global these variables can change in a lot of ways at almost any time.
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> pull out a debugger or use console logs to trace what's happening.
[14:02:02] <rfr_> I am making TipAmount global to keep in scope because I don't know how to pass it to the PayWithStipe function when also passing (e) event. I'm just one guy doing my best.
[14:02:28] <robertmaxrees> is paywithstripe a function you wrote?
[14:03:31] <robertmaxrees> and what happens if you do console.log(TipAmount); right before that if (TipAmount > 1) { ?
[14:04:07] <rfr_> No, I wrote the code that is posted which is the part that is not working. I have only modified (25%) payWithStripe which seems to be working fine.
[14:04:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you do console.log(TipAmount); right before that if (TipAmount > 1) { ?
[14:05:56] <robertmaxrees> and i was wondering if paywithstripe was something provided by stripe or something you/somebody else in your org/whatever wrote.
[14:07:15] <rfr_> No not provided by stripe. I will try and open up devloper console on the page. I pasted the code into jsbin and got no errors.
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> so normally you'd declare tipamount in processform and then pass it as an argument to that other function.
[14:08:04] <robertmaxrees> either way, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a good guide on debugging.
[14:08:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd also hit up ##javascript since your issue has nothing to do with jquery :)
[14:20:38] <rfr_> robertmaxrres: what tab in the developers console should I be looking at?
[14:20:42] <robertmaxrees> the console.
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> the link i shared will give you the rundown on the basics of debugging.
[14:25:11] <rfr_> Console just show my GET and POSTS back to the server. The link looked like it was a cartoon. I will check it out again.
[14:25:24] <robertmaxrees> actually check out the guide.
[14:25:46] <robertmaxrees> also, hit up ##javascript with any other questions, since your issues really don't have anything to do with jquery.
[14:27:09] <rfr_> Yeah, asked for help there. No answer.
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the topic of this channel :)
[14:27:36] <robertmaxrees> i also don't see your questions over there, but OK ;)
[14:28:25] <rfr_> I just realized I get: Cannot send to channel: ##javascript
[14:28:36] <robertmaxrees> need to register then.
[14:28:38] <robertmaxrees> probably.

[14:41:32] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?  having a hard time understanding the post.
[14:41:39] <robertmaxrees> also: have to considered asking in their forums?
[14:42:19] <sino> I don't have forum access yet
[14:42:37] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.

[14:46:03] <eindoofus__> hi, can someone point me to where i can learn to create dropdowns that can contain id values? for example, if i have a dropdown that displays cat, dog, fish, i'd like to also store their hidden id values like 1, 2, 3 so that when a user selects fish i can use the number 3
[14:46:18] <eindoofus__> is there a name for that sort of dropdown?
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> eindoofus_ that's called the value.
[14:47:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/onxtoccr/
[14:47:24] <eindoofus__> robertmaxrees, but there are two values for each item, the fish and the hidden 3 associated with it. don't believe standard value dropdowns can do that
[14:47:38] <eindoofus__> ohhhh
[14:47:39] <robertmaxrees> err, what?
[14:47:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:47:45] <eindoofus__> i c. thanks
[14:47:48] <robertmaxrees> you should only need the value.
[14:47:59] <eindoofus__> awesome :)
[14:52:18] <taplar> gaaaaah, i hate those few minutes before you go on vacation...
[14:53:47] <eindoofus__> taplar, know what you mean. same boat right now
[14:54:48] <taplar> meanwhile my stupid roommate has been off since last friday and is off until new years.  i want his job
[14:56:16] <eindoofus__> have a job with pretty good perks as well but it can be decieving. usually a reason why a job has to offer so many perks to retain people
[14:56:30] <taplar> heh, true true
[16:13:40] <akkufomk> yeah well here I sit in front of SQL Management Studio just watching the clock
[16:13:47] <akkufomk> I'm done

[16:14:58] <akkufomk> I'm good at making myself look busy
[16:36:06] <phelix> Having an issue trying to return results from an ajax call. http://pastie.org/10649905 Could someone maybe help me figure out what I am doing wrong.. I am sure that it has something to do with ajax call being asynchronous but not sure the solution so that this piece of code works properly.
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> you can't return results from ajax :)_
[16:37:01] <robertmaxrees> also, when you return from success/error, you're returning to $.ajax(), not to the function that calls ajax.
[16:37:09] <phelix> ohh, is there another way to accomplish what I am trying to do then?
[16:37:25] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on the data needs to be the success/done callback.
[16:37:30] <phelix> It needs to keep checking and posting that data every 5 seconds to test until it gets the correct data.
[16:37:52] <robertmaxrees> why are you using two ajax calls?  looks like they're doing the same thing.
[16:39:11] <phelix> Well the first call is when you click a button and it send the request to facebook and then facebook returns some data and they need to go to that website and type in the  code and then submit. While they are doing that the other call keeps checking to see if they have typed in the activation code. and once they have then the second ajax call will return the token
[16:39:20] <lumidee> hi, i want to have a tooltip when i click on a link, like the one on stackoverflow, when you click on 'share' (which opens a tooltip for the permalink). should i use jquery-ui for this? i noticed that jquery doesn't use jquery.2x, but jquery.1x, can both versions run side by side
[16:39:32] <robertmaxrees> phelix these two calls look basically identical.
[16:39:41] <robertmaxrees> lumidee huh?
[16:39:57] <robertmaxrees> 1.x and 2.x are the same - the difference is in browser support.
[16:40:05] <phelix> they are different. The second call is sending the code that is retrieved from the first call
[16:40:26] <robertmaxrees> phelix you mean the success handler is different?
[16:40:32] <phelix> and the first call returns to the user their activation code
[16:40:32] <robertmaxrees> because you're sending the same form data to both.
[16:40:36] <phelix> yes
[16:40:36] <lumidee> oh, then why would people use 2.x, considering that 1.x support more browsers (i guess)
[16:40:46] <phelix> well the results returned is different.
[16:41:04] <robertmaxrees> lumidee 1.x supports older browsers - if you don't need to support old IE, why send all the extra code?
[16:41:29] <robertmaxrees> phelix right, but the basic ajax call code is identical.  either way, you can use deferreds here.
[16:41:36] <lumidee> robertmaxrees, ah i see, i think i go with 2.x then. thanks!
[16:41:49] <robertmaxrees> phelix also, you want to use a recursive settimeout call here instead of setinterval
[16:41:59] <robertmaxrees> this code assumes that one call will always finish before the next.
[16:42:42] <phelix> Well the second call needs data from the first and it needs to repeat until the timeout is given or they submit the code and it returns an auth token
[16:42:59] <robertmaxrees> phelix that doesn't change that the way you're doing it is flawed ;)
[16:43:06] <phelix> Yes lol
[16:43:16] <phelix> Guess, I don't quite understand the way you are talking about. lol
[16:43:38] <robertmaxrees> your setInterval assumes that every ajax call will finish within 5 secons.
[16:43:40] <robertmaxrees> *seconds
[16:43:45] <robertmaxrees> so it'll keep firing even if they don't finish.
[16:43:54] <phelix> yes for now. That is easy to fix
[16:44:05] <robertmaxrees> anyway, use deferreds here.
[16:44:08] <phelix> trying to get the results returned properly
[16:44:16] <robertmaxrees> again, you cannot return the results :)
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/8981994da9d2 check this out.
[16:44:59] <phelix> k let me look at that..
[16:44:59] <robertmaxrees> return the ajax call itself, which is actually a jqXHR object, which also uses the promise interface.
[16:45:07] <robertmaxrees> so now you get .done() and all that.
[16:48:04] <lumidee> is jQuery 1.11.3 ==  jQuery 2.1.3    and  jQuery 1.11.4  ==  jQuery 2.1.4 ?
[16:48:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:48:33] <phelix> robertmaxrees, There you go! Your the man. wish I knew jquery that well. Slowly but surly =)
[16:48:33] <robertmaxrees> 1.11.3 == 2.1.4
[16:48:47] <robertmaxrees> phelix it's really not anything hidden.  the docs go over it in pretty good detail.
[16:48:54] <lumidee> ah thanks
[16:49:10] <phelix> Yes, just a ton of stuff to read and understand and be able to put it all together properly.
[16:49:14] <robertmaxrees> lumidee doesn't really matter - just use the latest of one or the other.
[16:49:20] <robertmaxrees> phelix not really, but OK :)
[16:49:55] <lumidee> robertmaxrees, i tried to replace the latest with 2.1.3 which i currently use, and then magnific popup didn't work anymore, that's why i try to stay with 2.1.3
[16:50:11] <robertmaxrees> "the latest with 2.1.3" huh?
[16:50:22] <lumidee> ye, tried to replace 2.1.4 with 2.1.4
[16:50:25] <lumidee> ye, tried to replace 2.1.4 with 2.1.3
[16:50:38] <DexDeadly> ahyone able to assist.  I had a link that would popup a modal in my template. I had it this way so that I can send an ID to the modal so the information would pull based off that value.  However FF doesn't look that and just returns [object Object]  I believe I need to have this in a function but unsure how to make sure it pull the ID value needed so that it populates my data.
[16:50:46] <robertmaxrees> lumidee you're backwards i think.
[16:50:59] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly make a fiddle or something.
[16:51:08] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly can't visualize your code based off a description :)
[16:51:40] <DexDeadly> http://pastebin.com/LUVEWGxr
[16:51:51] <DexDeadly> line 69 is how I had it working in an href tag
[16:51:54] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:52:00] <robertmaxrees> looks like you have a php question
[16:52:22] <robertmaxrees> if it IS a jquery question, show us the actual HTML.
[16:52:31] <lumidee> (maybe small things changed in 2.1.4, that jquery.magnific-popup.min.js (v1.0.0 2015-09-17) doesn't work with it (with 2.1.3 it works though))
[16:52:49] <robertmaxrees> lumidee any errors in your console?
[16:52:55] <lumidee> let me see
[16:53:14] <DexDeadly> I had this  <a class='btn btn-primary' href="javascript:$('#editGame .modal-body').load('game_edit_pop.php?id=<?php echo $game_data['id']; ?>',function(e){$('#editGame').modal('show');});">Edit Game</a> but this doesn't work in firefox
[16:53:21] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly make a jsfiddle.
[16:53:25] <robertmaxrees> with the actual js and html.
[16:54:12] <DexDeadly> hmmm
[16:54:14] <NoiseEee> also you need to look at your rendererd HTML
[16:54:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:54:26] <NoiseEee> the 'view source', after the php bits have been renderered
[16:57:53] <lumidee> robertmaxrees, thanks for the console hint :)  ... console complains about "forbidden access", so i had to chmod a+r the jquery.min.js file
[16:58:00] <lumidee> (now it works)
[16:58:51] <robertmaxrees> lumidee there you go :0
[17:00:29] <DexDeadly> <a class="btn btn-primary" href="javascript:$('#editGame .modal-body').load('game_edit_pop.php?id=640',function(e){$('#editGame').modal('show');});" id="eG">Edit Game</a> thats what I get in ff when I do an inspect
[17:00:35] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly closer.
[17:00:39] <robertmaxrees> now use jsfiddle.
[17:01:08] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use onclick - use .on()
[17:02:14] <NoiseEee> DexDeadly: href="javascript:   is just absurd
[17:02:52] <sillyslux> ayyyye hello :)
[17:03:38] <DexDeadly> Yea thats what I thought but when I was trying to pass a variable to the modal this is what I found to put in and it works in chrome but firefox says no
[17:03:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:03:59] <sillyslux> someone left reaaaaly fine wine and liqueorur on my terrace
[17:04:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't do it that way anyway.
[17:04:08] <sillyslux> thank you who ever you are
[17:04:12] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly are you trying to get the ID of the clicked link?
[17:04:36] <DexDeadly> in the modal I have a page included that needs the id of the game so populate the data
[17:04:59] <robertmaxrees> so put that ID in a data attribute and then access it in the  event handler.
[17:05:43] <robertmaxrees> like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ru16djrt/
[17:06:21] <sillyslux> ahh console.log
[17:06:23] <sillyslux> :D
[17:06:28] <sillyslux> yay
[17:06:48] <sillyslux> robertmaxrees, i've got an jsfiddle account too, now
[17:06:54] <robertmaxrees> cool
[17:06:56] <sillyslux> still working on that
[17:07:15] <sillyslux> i made a jsfiddle console extension :D
[17:07:43] <sillyslux> still wip thou
[17:11:17] <DexDeadly> robertmaxrees so I looked at what you are saying.  However I dont get a console output.  However correct me if I'm wrong, is the java only loading when the document is loading, if so the edit game buttons don't show until 2 seperate drop downs are done.
[17:11:30] <robertmaxrees> there is no java in play here.
[17:11:42] <DexDeadly> well the script part
[17:11:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean the javascript?
[17:12:38] <DexDeadly> yes
[17:12:41] <DexDeadly> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[17:12:52] <robertmaxrees> you need to load jquery buddy
[17:13:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ru16djrt/ this works ;)
[17:14:04] <DexDeadly> I have <script src="js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script> loaded
[17:14:10] <robertmaxrees> before your code?
[17:14:13] <robertmaxrees> in the head?
[17:14:17] <robertmaxrees> and that isn't 404ing?
[17:14:17] <DexDeadly> at the end
[17:14:28] <robertmaxrees> your code needs to come after jquery.
[17:14:37] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with a making a dropdown menu?  I have the menu setup but I want to make the menu slide out when clicked and then slide up when clicked again.  I also want to change the arrow.  https://jsfiddle.net/2up4arv1/
[17:15:01] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ sure!  what have you tried?
[17:15:38] <_TWG_> Well I wasn't sure how to trigger the event.  Let me update the jQuery code that I had written.  One minute.
[17:16:19] <DexDeadly> i put it at the top. I still get that its not defined. Is that because when the page loads my #eG is not on the page.
[17:16:38] <cmrabet> Hi, I'm using bootstrap spinbox plugin and instead of having to initiate each input box with its own values in the constructor array, I'd like to have a single method that pulls values from HTML attr. I'm trying to do .forEach after doing a find, but Chrome is giving me an error that .forEach method doesn't exist, can anyone give me a hand with this one? The code is at https://jsfiddle.net/7Lgcacph/ thanks
[17:16:41] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly your code needs to come after jquery.
[17:17:14] <_TWG_> robermaxrees here is the code that I had written so far.  Still learning jQuery so wasn't too sure on what to do exactly.  https://jsfiddle.net/2up4arv1/1/#&togetherjs=v1E2ekhGl2
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ good start. so what's the first thing you want to do?
[17:18:03] <robertmaxrees> also that font resources is invalid.
[17:18:05] <_TWG_> Well I want to check if any item is expanded yet and collapse them and then expand the one I clicked.
[17:18:16] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ right, so start with the first part.
[17:18:49] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees okay.
[17:19:13] <robertmaxrees> show try to show the child ul of the thing you clicked.
[17:19:33] <sillyslux> funfact: jsfiddle is all mootools
[17:19:35] <robertmaxrees> protip: create a "hide" class that you add/remove to hide/show things.
[17:19:42] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux known for a while.
[17:20:12] <sillyslux> haha try to find mootools plugins for xy
[17:20:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:20:21] <sillyslux> nowadays
[17:20:29] <sillyslux> it's soo dead
[17:20:30] <robertmaxrees> lots of legacy codebases out there using it.
[17:20:39] <cmrabet> solved with .each, thanks
[17:20:59] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet++
[17:22:26] <DexDeadly> ok so i placed it in a function, it pulls the right variable
[17:22:30] <DexDeadly> i see it echo in concole
[17:22:36] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly cool
[17:26:35] <DexDeadly> it didnt like when I used an ID though but switched it to a class
[17:26:48] <DexDeadly> now i just need to place that number in the code sent to the popup
[17:26:48] <robertmaxrees> "it didn't like when i used an ID" huh?
[17:26:51] <robertmaxrees> use a data attribute for that.
[17:27:32] <DexDeadly> so what i meant was in your fiddle you put it on .btn-primary.  Well thats used on other buttons so I tried doing #eG.  Doing that it would only work on the first button in the loop.  Switched it to a .eG and its working on all
[17:27:49] <lumidee> there is a share link below each stackoverflow question and answer. if you click on it, it gives you a permalink to the exact post. i like that the link is already preselected so you just have to hit ctrl+  see: http://i.imgur.com/oznktbk.jpg  how can i do this with jQuery? i am not sure if tooltip is suitable for this and whether html (input field) can be within the tooltip content
[17:28:08] <robertmaxrees> err, DexDeadly you can't use an ID more than once.
[17:28:19] <DexDeadly> yea brain fart on that one
[17:28:28] <DexDeadly> i realized it, switched and it works.
[17:28:34] <robertmaxrees> lumidee you can put anything you want in a tooltop.
[17:28:37] <robertmaxrees> *tooltip.
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> it's just html.
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> lumidee there are dozens of tooltip plugins out there - just use one of those and you're well on your way.
[17:30:52] <lumidee> robertmaxrees, hm, i read this post, saying that there's a workaround to put html into the tooltip, but it might open oneself to cross site attacks. maybe i misunderstood the question/answers though: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15734408
[17:31:08] <robertmaxrees> lumidee do you understand what XSS is?
[17:31:38] <lumidee> robertmaxrees, a little bit
[17:31:48] <lumidee> wikipedia: " XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy."
[17:32:01] <robertmaxrees> lumidee are you going to show content supplied by an end user?
[17:32:23] <lumidee> no, the link is generated solelyy serverside
[17:32:29] <robertmaxrees> lumidee then you're fine.
[17:32:35] <lumidee> thanks for assuring
[17:33:29] <lumidee> robertmaxrees, by tooltip plugins, you means something like qtip2?
[17:34:08] <sillyslux> holy.. i'm so taotallly drunk..
[17:34:30] <sillyslux> 'nd off su...
[17:35:28] <lumidee> (hm guess I give tooltipster a try, looks good on the first sight)
[17:37:22] <robertmaxrees> there's also powertip and a few others.
[17:39:48] <DexDeadly> robertmaxrees, so when that javascript is fired, is it posting data? therefore I can post the id thats being returned to the form.
[17:41:23] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly huh?
[17:41:27] <robertmaxrees> what javascript?
[17:42:33] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/3grh3h4y/
[17:43:06] <robertmaxrees> this isn't posting data anywhere.
[17:43:25] <DexDeadly> Se ewhat I did to the script.  I see the line console.log outputs the ID number.  I need that ID number to now post to the game_edit_pop.php file
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> it's a GET
[17:43:37] <robertmaxrees> not a post.
[17:44:01] <DexDeadly> got ya i misspoke
[17:44:50] <DexDeadly> ok so then can i send the id if I had the get as game_edit_pop.php?id=
[17:45:03] <robertmaxrees> then define the object correctly.
[17:45:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3grh3h4y/1/
[17:49:34] <Fall> errr
[17:54:02] <DexDeadly> adding that line gives me this from consol SyntaxError: missing } after property list
[17:54:25] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[17:54:37] <robertmaxrees> (i lost the link i tossed out)
[17:55:48] <DexDeadly> http://bestpph.website/admin/game_list.php
[17:56:02] <robertmaxrees> that's... not a fiddle.
[17:56:17] <robertmaxrees> either way, id: $(this).data('gameid');  is your problem.
[17:56:19] <robertmaxrees> kill the semicolon.
[17:56:19] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3grh3h4y/1/
[17:57:17] <DexDeadly> got ya
[17:57:26] <iaj> Can someone tell me the reason (or the fix) to get this one here working in Safari also? http://pastie.org/10649984
[17:57:38] <iaj> Working fine on Firefox/Chrome.
[17:57:41] <DexDeadly> that worked still no data, the popup shows just everythings blank.  I fear the id isn't getting there
[17:58:07] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly then look at your network tab.
[17:58:39] <robertmaxrees> gotta whole host of tools at your disposal.
[18:00:42] <DexDeadly> ahhh
[18:02:13] <DexDeadly> so I noticed according to network once you said that it was sending a POST so I updated my javascript to just load the file within the modal and then in that file I just bind the parameter using $_POST
[18:02:15] <DexDeadly> thanks
[18:02:17] <DexDeadly> mate
[18:29:35] <lumidee> how can i have tooltipster to select all elements with the id '#my-tooltip'? right now it shows the tooltip only for the first element with the specified id.  $(id='#my-tooltip').tooltipster({
[18:29:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[18:29:46] <robertmaxrees> only one element can use a given ID.
[18:29:50] <robertmaxrees> use a class instead.
[18:30:00] <lumidee> ah thanks! trying that
[18:30:45] <lumidee> works flawless,, thanks again :)
[18:30:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
