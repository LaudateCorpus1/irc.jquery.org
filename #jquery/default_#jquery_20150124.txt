[03:49:31] <Guest24293> Hello, I want to start using jquery in Brackets but I don't know how to incorporate jquery into the editor. I've downloaded jquery but I'm still lost.
[03:56:23] <arthurvr> hey all!
[03:56:25] <arthurvr> hey Omar-
[04:18:12] <Omar-> hi arthurvr!
[04:18:24] <Omar-> how are you mate?
[04:20:28] <arthurvr> Omar-: I’m fine :) how about you?
[04:29:11] <the_tricky> hello there, guys
[04:29:29] <the_tricky> i am using a slideToggle() method
[04:29:48] <the_tricky> and when my page is full screen it goes from top to bottom
[04:30:12] <the_tricky> and when it is not, it goes from bottom to top
[04:30:21] <the_tricky> what's the matter?
[04:30:35] <arthurvr> the_tricky: can you provide a fiddle? I don’t exactly get what you mean
[04:31:14] <the_tricky> arthurvr: there so much disgusting code there
[04:31:18] <the_tricky> let me explain
[04:31:29] <the_tricky> it reveals a hidden div
[04:31:54] <arthurvr> ”there so much disgusting code there” that’s exactly the point of reduced tescases
[04:32:03] <arthurvr> jsfiddle, or jsbin if you like
[04:32:20] <the_tricky> when i set my browser window width to my screen width it reveals from top to bottom
[04:32:48] <arthurvr> what do you mean with from top to bottom?
[04:32:58] <arthurvr> you mean the animation while showing up the div?
[04:33:08] <the_tricky> yep, exactly
[04:33:24] <the_tricky> first you see the top part and gradually the full div
[04:34:09] <the_tricky> and when my browser window is half screen width, it reveals from bottom to top
[04:34:25] <the_tricky> first you see the bottom part and then gradually the full div
[04:34:42] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/sszr0wwx/
[04:35:03] <arthurvr> can you try to replicate your situation there?
[04:37:10] <the_tricky> ok, let me try
[04:41:55] <the_tricky> that's strange, my code works ok there
[04:42:16] <arthurvr> then it’s more likely to be a problem with your other code :)
[04:42:28] <the_tricky> yes, i think so
[04:42:32] <the_tricky> thanks, anyway
[04:42:37] <arthurvr> try to create a reduced testcase, I’ll be happy to help
[04:44:25] <Omar-> arthurvr i'm great, thanks :)
[05:08:40] <arup_r>  How can I send the flash message to the aJax call when there is no data to the server?  https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/58a95a1b862ebd39db01
[05:12:20] <lexmihaylov> arup_r, why not send it with the response json and add it to your page with jquery
[05:13:54] <arup_r> Not a bad idea.. You meant instead of the [] array .. I should send like [{flash: "meesage}].. Right?
[05:14:52] <arup_r> But then the whole Jquery logic it seems need to change.
[05:20:47] <lexmihaylov> arup_r, well yes, you will need to do some work on your js ;)
[05:22:24] <arup_r> Humm..:)
[05:22:33] <arup_r> That I was trying to remove.. :)
[05:23:35] <lexmihaylov> the thing is that the flash message is saved in a session, and for it to show, you will need to reload the page
[05:24:11] <lexmihaylov> and as I can understand from your, that is not an option
[05:27:04] <arup_r> hum
[06:51:16] <MEGAGHZ> Hello
[06:51:25] <arthurvr> MEGAGHZ: Hi!
[09:42:53] <gimmulf>  Hi, shouldnt this be enough to get the width from <img src... id="image"> and set the width="" attribute of page-container div to that same width? thankful for your help :)    $width  = $('#image').width();   $('#page-container').attr('width',width);
[09:44:15] <cjohnson> use prop not attr
[09:44:35] <systemfault> Why would you even set the width/height attribute of an image dynamically?
[09:44:42] <systemfault> Just use CSS at this point.
[09:44:48] <arthurvr> yah
[09:45:28] <cjohnson> yep works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/rfhfky5t/
[09:45:36] <systemfault> The width/height attributes are good when defined "initially in the markup" as it avoids useless reflows...
[09:48:41] <Velveeta> yeah!
[10:00:57] <gimmulf> systemfault: I am trying to take the width of an image and apply it on a div
[10:01:08] <arthurvr> oh
[10:04:39] <arthurvr> gimmulf: if I don’t get you wrong, this is what you try to do?
[10:04:40] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/76youoyk/
[10:06:01] <gimmulf> arthurvr: yes looks good, my only concern would be that I have no width attribute set on the image
[10:06:14] <gimmulf> is it required?
[10:06:23] <arthurvr> nope
[10:06:34] <arthurvr> I just did it so it fits in the fiddle result field
[10:06:58] <arthurvr> gimmulf: http://jsfiddle.net/76youoyk/1/
[10:13:59] <IgnitedGeek> hi all, I am using datatables and x-editable to make an editable datatable, however when paginating the second page does not have editable fields but the first page still does. How do I go about making it so that this works on all pages?
[10:14:56] <gimmulf> arthurvr: hmm, I cannot find the width value outputted aywhere in my source code after rendering the page
[10:15:45] <arthurvr> gimmulf: if something doesn’t work, testcase please (jsfiddle or so). It shouldn’t change the source code too.
[10:17:28] <gimmulf> oki, thank you arthurvr
[10:19:16] <arthurvr> gimmulf: `.width()` just changes the css
[10:22:13] <arup_r> Hi I am trying to open the links in a new tab.. But it is not happening.. What wrong am I doing ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b15d9916a9e40a58f4c2
[10:22:32] <IgnitedGeek> hmm ok I found a callback fnDrawCallback for datatable, this makes the editable fields on all pages, but its broken, it doesnt show what the current rows default value is, and it won’t load the select options. let me set up a fiddle
[10:28:20] <BinaryKitten> arup_r - $('a.linksSelector').attr('target', '_blank');
[10:33:05] <arup_r1>  Hi I am trying to open the links in a new tab.. But it is not happening.. What wrong am I doing ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b15d9916a9e40a58f4c2
[10:33:29] <m4ggus> your links are generated after the bind is processed so the new links diddn't trigger it
[10:33:40] <m4ggus> *didn't
[10:34:31] <m4ggus> you can use .on() on an outer element and define you link as the selector
[10:35:22] <arup_r1> .click() wouldn't work? m4ggus:
[10:35:54] <m4ggus> not in this case cause your links aren't part of the dom when the bind click is processed
[10:36:32] <m4ggus> $(document).on('click', '#name-listings_2 > li > a', function(evt) { ... });
[10:36:38] <m4ggus> should do the trick
[10:36:56] <m4ggus> but i would take an element that is nearer to you list element and not bind on document
[10:38:40] <arup_r1> let me try
[10:41:49] <arup_r1> still not opening in a new tab (https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/b15d9916a9e40a58f4c2) m4ggus:
[10:43:48] <m4ggus> #client_surname is not an parent of your inserted structure?
[10:44:23] <m4ggus> its a sibling on the same level
[10:45:12] <arup_r1> Ahh! mistake..
[10:47:18] <gimmulf> arthurvr: great its working, however I am wondering about " + 'px'", if I want to add another 200px can I simply do> + '200' ?
[10:47:53] <arup_r1> m4ggus: It is working now.. :)
[10:47:56] <arup_r1> Thankls
[10:48:12] <arthurvr> gimmulf: yes you can drop it - I just included it in case you wanted other units
[10:49:02] <gimmulf> arthurvr: actually it came handy, but when I do + '200' the div for some reason seem to get 100% width
[10:49:20] <gimmulf> seems like it breaks
[10:49:43] <arup_r1>  I need to give them some styles.. http://s24.postimg.org/60ef5g4b9/nameslist.png Could you give some idea.. How to styles them so that it looks good ? These names are coming via the Ajax... Inside the <div>. JS code is - https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/88d22cb3ca35ff7dd8e8 .Can anyone give me some ideas about the appearance?
[10:50:09] <arthurvr> gimmulf: I was confusing it with .css(), if you want other units use `.css(‘width’, ‘3em’)`
[10:50:45] <arthurvr> but normally it should work with .width() too
[10:51:03] <arthurvr> gimmulf: again, testcase please :)
[10:53:24] <gimmulf> arthurvr: like this? :)  http://jsfiddle.net/76youoyk/2/  ( I assume not )
[10:53:53] <arthurvr> gimmulf: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/76youoyk/3/
[10:54:26] <arthurvr> gimmulf: but use the right quotes: http://jsfiddle.net/76youoyk/4/
[10:56:21] <gimmulf> arthurvr: I meant I would like to add 200px to var imageWidth after it has its value set from image
[10:56:31] <arthurvr> gimmulf: oh
[10:56:44] <arthurvr> gimmulf: just use the `+` operator then
[10:56:45] <gimmulf> sorry for not being more clear
[10:57:18] <arthurvr> gimmulf: here you go sir http://jsfiddle.net/76youoyk/5/
[10:57:20] <m4ggus> arup_r1: :) you are welcome
[10:58:37] <gimmulf> arthurvr: ahh great thank you so much for your time :)
[10:58:54] <arthurvr> gimmulf: You’re welcome!
[11:04:16] <arup_r> m4ggus: I need a CSS help also.. Never wokred on CSS
[11:08:13] <m4ggus> my css knowledge is moderate but i'm not a design guy - and it seems this is more a design question than a css one :)
[11:09:21] <arup_r> Exactly
[11:28:59] <arup_r> How should I decrease the space between the text "Duplicate Clients:" and the ordered list items ? http://s24.postimg.org/60ef5g4b9/nameslist.png abd https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/f52572f1fc01bc994a1b
[12:02:50] <Velveeta> arup_r: you can probably just tweak the margin or padding
[12:03:23] <arup_r> I did.. http://jsfiddle.net/mwyyccms/4/
[12:03:44] <arup_r> But in my case.. list are coming some other way
[12:04:19] <Velveeta> what do you mean by 'coming some other way'?
[12:04:47] <arup_r> well.. moment please
[12:07:11] <arup_r> velveeta: see http://s14.postimg.org/i4qngohvl/nameslist2.png
[12:07:37] <Velveeta> ok, so they look much closer now
[12:07:58] <arup_r> Yes...
[12:08:24] <arup_r> But it should display padding to the right little bit..
[12:08:37] <arup_r> It looks currently much worse :(
[12:08:53] <Velveeta> well, we won't be able to help you without seeing a working demo to be able to help tweak styles one way or another
[12:09:15] <arup_r> I gave you the JSfiddle
[12:09:27] <arup_r> Anything else you want.. Let me know
[12:11:19] <Velveeta> that jsfiddle is incomplete, it only includes 2 css rules, none of your external css from your actual site, so it doesn't really help
[12:13:01] <arup_r> ohh...
[12:58:06] <jrkie> hey
[12:58:15] <arthurvr> hey jrkie
[12:58:33] <jrkie> does anyone know howto use highlight.js in a mode so it won't show the background when the longest line has shown? https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/ i mean the background is a way to large i believe
[12:58:52] <jrkie> it should stop to show the background when the line end has reached
[12:59:33] <jrkie> like a no fullscreen option or what
[13:00:55] <jrkie> custom width should do it
[13:22:38] <Trekka12> Hey guys, Im experiencing trouble with a Lightbox I wish to have on a company website that is responsively designed
[13:22:51] <Trekka12> Namely this lightbox: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[13:23:41] <Trekka12> the problem Im having is that its used on a scrollable page, and once scrolled down a bit, its like the script tries to compensate for the scroll or something - so it adds like positioning top: 3000px and makes the zoomed in image appear way to low so its unable to watch it even
[13:23:56] <Trekka12> any1 familiar with this issue and might have a suggested solution?
[13:24:46] <Trekka12> It does however not seem to do this on their own demo page?
[13:26:00] <Ansikt> TrafficMan, I've never used that plugin before.  Perhaps try to replicate the issue in a JS fiddle?
[13:26:09] <Ansikt> Sorry, I meant Trekka12
[13:26:57] <Trekka12> hmm seems potentially time consuming :/ but you think this is common problem for LightBoxes? or its not so often heard of=?
[13:28:15] <Ansikt> There's a million ways to write a lytebox.  "It's like saying your table is a strange color, is this a common problem with tables?"
[13:28:43] <Trekka12> hm ok
[13:29:03] <Ansikt> Not trying to be flippiant, but you should try reconstructing the problem in a fiddle.  A) because it's unlikely anyone else her has encountered your issue
[13:29:07] <Trekka12> Could it be because of how I position the surrounding container element where the image links are placed with the Lightbox?
[13:29:17] <Trekka12> hm ok
[13:29:26] <Ansikt> and B) because often when you try to recreate the problem, you'll end up finding out 'by accident' what's causing it
[13:29:48] <Trekka12> hm k..
[13:30:04] <Trekka12> otherwise, u know of a lightbox u have experience from you know works good?
[13:30:45] <Ansikt> I've used jQuery.colorbox, but it's not responsive.  I doubt this is a problem with the lightbox plugin its self, but rather with the implimentation code around it
[13:30:53] <Ansikt> implementation, even
[13:32:02] <Trekka12> ok
[13:32:03] <Trekka12> :/
[13:32:24] <Trekka12> just so annoyjing - there always seem to be yet another problem or bug or whatever
[13:32:25] <Trekka12> :P
[13:32:38] <Trekka12> just for once I wish it all worked instantly with no fuzz :P
[13:37:34] <Ansikt> Just for once?  I always wish that?
[13:40:28] <Trekka12> hehe ok true :P
[13:40:29] <Trekka12> xD
[13:40:38] <Trekka12> Btw.
[13:40:53] <Trekka12> You know if floats etc. can affect how the LightBox gets positioned when it appears?
[13:41:04] <Trekka12> Cuz the image link is placed within a floated container
[13:41:25] <Trekka12> I see in script-creators website they only use display: block; for the cotnainer
[13:41:27] <roxlu> hey, I'm working on a filedrop feature for a website and I want to allow the user to drop a file anywhere in the window so I added a $(document).on('dragenter') and leave event. But I'm receiving these events also when I move over any other element in the page so I'm receiving lots and lots of events. Is there a better way to do this?
[13:47:27] <Ansikt> Trekka12, Float is positioning, display: block is display.  The way floats interact with other things is really complex, and doesn't make much sense to people new to CSS.  I'd highly recommend you read this article:
[13:47:46] <Ansikt> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box_model
[13:47:53] <Trekka12> k, thx
[13:48:17] <roxlu> ah nvm, found the solution :)
[13:48:26] <roxlu> here http://tiku.io/questions/2704603/ondragenter-do-not-affect-children
[13:50:03] <plamb> hi guys, any idea why this jquery typer slows down in the actual typing on the extra spans?
[13:50:05] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/nrvf16kc/2/
[13:50:17] <plamb> (the javascript generating the typing is at the bottom of the JS pane)
[14:00:06] <Trekka12> Ansikt, this was what was used to determine the lightboxes top position: $window.scrollTop() + this.options.positionFromTop;
[14:00:23] <Trekka12> I added this instead: top = ($(window).height() - $('#lightbox').height()) /2; <- and now seems to be placed properly?
[14:00:37] <Trekka12> But I dont understand what I did exactly? :P
[14:01:02] <Ansikt> You wrote better centering code, it looks like
[14:01:06] <Trekka12> or why the newly added code works and the old one doesnt
[14:01:09] <Trekka12> oO
[14:01:29] <Trekka12> but how come it works for like... every1 else with the old code, and not for me except for with this new one? seems strange to me
[14:01:36] <Ansikt> Also, it doesn't get computed by the current scroll height, you could trigger it a bajillion times and it won't cause the box to move around
[14:01:51] <Trekka12> so the new code is better?
[14:01:54] <Ansikt> Eeeh
[14:01:59] <Trekka12> or u refer to old one?
[14:02:31] <Ansikt> They behave differently, I guess.  I'd have to actually see the page to know.  But I think you should just use the one that works.
[14:03:10] <Trekka12> ok, now for the real test - see how it works on iPad - that is where I had problems with another lightbox that worked for computers that used this newly added "centering code", but it had problems on iPad :S
[14:03:14] <Trekka12> *fingers crossed*
[14:05:31] <plamb> a-anyone
[14:08:45] <Doddlin> plamb, maybe there is a delay for each new span so it is not actually slowing down, just adding the initial delay for each letter since there is only one in each span?
[14:09:46] <plamb> thats what i thought
[14:09:52] <plamb> looked through the code looking for that delay
[14:09:52] <Doddlin> plamb, maybe you could customize the function for that single span, like give it it’s own type-fn and lower the typespeed
[14:10:05] <plamb> and couldnt find anything
[14:10:15] <plamb> other than a little while loop that executes when it encounters a "<"
[14:10:26] <plamb> but that shouldnt slow it down to anything noticeable to humans.. i think
[14:11:04] <Doddlin> what line?
[14:11:48] <plamb> umm
[14:12:02] <plamb> 132
[14:12:05] <plamb> that code block
[14:14:54] <Doddlin> plamb, yeah, no clue to be truly honest, seems to be a quick while on 132, as you say, probably not spotted by the user :S
[14:15:05] <plamb> ya
[14:15:08] <plamb> weird right?
[14:15:30] <Doddlin> plamb, but hang on
[14:15:41] <Doddlin> watch the animation again, it IS that function
[14:15:52] <plamb> the one on 132 ?
[14:16:11] <plamb> not sure why it flashes the "<" either
[14:16:14] <Doddlin> it is actually printing out that ’<’ just to erase it again and replace it with the letter
[14:16:20] <plamb> wtf
[14:16:21] <Doddlin> exactly
[14:16:28] <plamb> why doesnt that happen on the <br>'s then
[14:17:06] <Doddlin> no clue
[14:17:13] <plamb> lol
[14:17:14] <Doddlin> COULD be because it is a self-ending tag
[14:17:18] <plamb> oh
[14:17:21] <Doddlin> needs no </br>
[14:17:27] <plamb> so strange
[14:17:32] <Doddlin> but I’m really not sure
[14:18:08] <Doddlin> however, maybe you could just use a callback when the first part is done and call to a new type-fn for the WITHIN 5-part
[14:18:25] <plamb> ya
[14:18:30] <Doddlin> guess that might be a workaroung
[14:18:33] <Doddlin> around*
[14:18:34] <plamb> i was trying to avoid writing as much js as possible
[14:18:40] <plamb> the JS that runs this thing is from
[14:18:45] <plamb> https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js
[14:19:36] <Doddlin> plamb, use ^1000 if you want the brake?
[14:19:43] <Doddlin> *pause
[14:19:51] <plamb> say h'what
[14:19:57] <plamb> might have to hold my hand through this
[14:19:58] <Doddlin> plamb, https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js#type-pausing
[14:20:19] <plamb> you think its somehow pausing?
[14:20:39] <Doddlin> do you want the pause?
[14:21:00] <plamb> no i want it to print WITHIN 5 as at the same speed
[14:21:04] <plamb> as the previous words
[14:21:22] <Doddlin> but as it is now you have them in separate spans
[14:21:24] <plamb> and for some reason those extra <span>'s slow it down
[14:21:41] <Doddlin> why do u need the spans?
[14:21:44] <plamb> yeah, the reason for that is a little styling thing i want to do
[14:21:49] <plamb> this
[14:21:50] <plamb> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7155646/backlight_test.html
[14:22:45] <Doddlin> plamb, maybe you will have to append the classes with jquery after the print has been made?
[14:23:23] <plamb> yeah i just suck at writing jquery :)
[14:23:27] <plamb> was hoping i'd get lucky
[14:23:30] <Doddlin> plamb, so do I ;)
[14:23:51] <Doddlin> I’ve found you are very seldom lucky while coding...
[14:23:56] <plamb> haha
[14:24:10] <plamb> throw a new use case at some dudes js library and bam
[14:24:12] <plamb> everything breaks
[14:24:33] <Doddlin> hahaha
[14:24:37] <Doddlin> true story
[14:40:54] <Doddlin> plamb, I’ve tried some fiddling, haven’t come up with anything good but I would probably make that into a separate span containing WITHIN 5, set a class/ID for that span that will make it easy to select it and then write a function that splits it after the writing is done
[14:41:23] <Doddlin> that will keep the writing speed up and make it easIER for you to accomplish what you want
[14:42:41] <plamb> ya
[14:42:55] <plamb> even if you leave it as a seperate span, it still chokes for a second on the first span
[14:43:00] <plamb> but its much more unnoticeable
[14:50:57] <ezioa> this keeps telling me that appendchild is an undefined function: var li = $('<li style="display:none;"></li>').eq(0);
[14:50:57] <ezioa>                 $(li).appendChild(img);
[14:52:58] <ezioa> ah derr
[14:54:19] <ezioa> it was right all along
[14:55:43] <plamb> Doddlin:
[14:55:52] <plamb> i think the issue is that it chokes on two htmltags strung together
[14:56:10] <Doddlin> OH!
[14:56:18] <Doddlin> that’d make sense
[14:58:53] <Doddlin> plamb, I think splitting it and appending new spans after the print is the easiest WA
[14:59:46] <plamb> maybe this
[14:59:47] <plamb> http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/200B/index.htm
[15:00:04] <plamb> just plop those inbetween the spans
[15:01:26] <Doddlin> plamb, try that! might work! good idea
[15:08:49] <Doddlin> plamb, let me know how it goes! :)
[15:11:00] <plamb> ya for sure
[15:11:14] <plamb> heres an unfinished example
[15:11:15] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/nrvf16kc/11/
[15:11:26] <plamb> with spaces/negative-margin
[15:11:49] <Doddlin> Great!
[15:12:50] <Doddlin> nice job!
[15:15:53] <plamb> also tweeted the guy that made it and asked him
[15:15:56] <plamb> i bet he'll fix it
[15:16:04] <Doddlin> (Y)

[19:44:44] <Mark_2> does anybodyanybody know how i can make a website like this using only jquery? http://vlanda.com/
[19:52:59] <systemfault> Mark_2: Yes but you should consider using something like backbone + jquery
[19:53:17] <Mark_2> what is backbone?
[19:55:39] <systemfault> Mark_2: A very small MVC framework that works on top of jQuery, it could help you avoid writing spaghetti code.
[19:58:36] <Mark_2> what’s a spaghetti code lol
[20:02:39] <systemfault> Mark_2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code :)
[20:04:03] <Mark_2> god, i won’t be using anyof those codes at least for next a couple of years.
[20:04:09] <Mark_2> im only a beginner ;p
[20:33:19] <Velveeta_> also, if you're just a beginner, you might want to consider a slightly less ambitious site to duplicate :)
