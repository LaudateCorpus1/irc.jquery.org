[04:17:50] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm having problems with jQtip
[04:18:08] <JosefDe> I'm doing an initializen for multiple elements. But only for 1 element the tooltip is shown
[04:20:14] <JosefDe> This problem occurs if I try doing this: https://jsfiddle.net/9oc553se/
[04:20:32] <JosefDe> If I directly initialize qtip in the browser-console for the different <span>'s it works perfectly.
[04:21:45] <JosefDe> Does this have something to do with classname? Do I have to use id's instead?
[04:24:48] <robhol> why use jsfiddle when there's not a working example? :p
[04:26:04] <JosefDe> robhol: You see no code?
[04:26:35] <robhol> I see the JS, but the whole point of jsfiddle is that you can add HTML and CSS so it actually does something :p
[04:30:28] <JosefDe> ok. How can I include the qtip library?
[04:32:00] <JosefDe> jsfiddle says "qtip" is not a function.
[04:36:17] <JosefDe> can anyone help me?
[04:40:12] <JosefDe> ok fixed it. Love you guys
[06:24:10] <cuppy> Why am I getting "str.substr is not a function" when I run this? https://jsfiddle.net/ajm4gvz6/
[06:31:59] <shoky> cuppy: because str is not a string
[06:57:03] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/yt3i what am I doing wrong here? I want it not to continue if the status code is 401
[07:02:48] <STEVOOO> Kartagis: wonder if i can implement this so that a group of people can be in a "room" and live talk to eachother, like teampeak
[07:03:11] <Kartagis> implement what?
[07:03:22] <STEVOOO> the voice recorder thing
[07:03:27] <STEVOOO> you posted to me :P
[07:03:56] <Kartagis> the best way to see if you can is to try

[07:56:19] <gajus> its been awhile since I have looked/asked for a "jquery plugin", but this turned out to be a lot more tricky than I thought to code.
[07:56:49] <gajus> I need a "roulette" plugin for displaying a number of options with back/forth buttons when options do not fit
[07:57:02] <gajus> & that works in a fluid width container
[07:57:14] <gajus> coding the last bit so far is proving a real pita
[07:58:03] <gajus> a very primitive example can be seen here, http://applaudience.com/life/
[07:58:13] <gajus> does anyone know of a ready made "jquery plugin"
[07:58:15] <gajus> for that>
[08:01:24] <gajus> its called "carousel" apparently.
[08:03:00] <gajus> owlcarousel
[08:03:04] <gajus> looks alright
[09:24:47] <motaka2> hello I have several forms in severaal pages that by changing the language in their select box i should load the translations in those fields. Should I use a plugin ?
[09:33:52] <rindolf> Hi all. Happy Sukkoth! Sup?
[09:55:38] <Kamuela> anyone using webpack with jquery?
[10:01:31] <motaka3> lets say a plugin hits some instances how can I send different configs for each instant ?
[10:17:23] <shoky_> motaka3: depends on the plugin.  but if they're like most standard plugins, it's usually just a matter of calling with different options for each instance. e.g.  $('#a').plugin({..config for a..});  $('#b').plugin({..config for b..});
[10:23:33] <rindolf> Kamuela: hi, what's the question? Don't ask to ask.
[10:41:11] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[11:20:45] <motaka3> shoky_: thank you
[11:37:13] <joepie91> quick unusual question. you can call $("selector", context) to find items within a certain 'fake root'. is there a way to obtain a copy of the jQuery object that 1) is automatically bound to a certain context, whatever you end up doing with it, and 2) still exposes things like $.ajax? I'm looking to implement a 'namespaced' jQuery object for use with Riot
[11:37:29] <joepie91> a .bind-like equivalent to the context argment, if you will
[11:38:17] <joepie91> (there's .proxy but this only affects `this`, rather than the 'root' for traversal operations)
[11:40:59] <santosh> How would you retrieve  https://www.flickr.com/photos/sntsh/21282472302/ from this json? https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=132455232@N07&lang=en-us&format=json
[11:41:14] <santosh> Hint- that link is from first items description
[11:43:31] <santosh> I hope everybody understood my situation?
[11:47:12] <rindolf> santosh: is it inside some HTML markup?
[11:47:20] <rindolf> santosh: because it looks this way.
[11:47:29] <rindolf> santosh: ah no.
[11:47:41] <shoky_> joepie91 the 'root' for traversal operations is always the element(s) wrapped by the jquery object. can you give an example of what you mean?  also are you sure you meant to say $.ajax there?
[11:47:49] <rindolf> santosh: you can do json['items'][0]['link']
[11:48:22] <joepie91> shoky_: yeah, I'm sure :) it was meant as an example of a... 'static' method, for lack of a better word, that is available on the jQuery module itself, but not on objects returned from eg. find()
[11:48:48] <joepie91> shoky_: basically, I'm looking to get the result of .find(), but while retaining those 'static' methods
[11:49:09] <joepie91> shoky_: and present that as "the jquery library" inside my module
[11:50:11] <shoky_> i dont understand the relevance of those static methods..? they're just functions on the $ object, have nothing to do with jquery objects or .find()
[11:50:23] <joepie91> shoky_: yes, that's the problem.
[11:50:59] <joepie91> shoky_: to illustrate it with a hypothetical bindContext method, this is what I'd be looking for: var $ = jQuery.bindContext(".fake-root")
[11:51:11] <joepie91> which is of course not valid, but for the sake of explaining what I'm after
[11:51:27] <shoky_> ah
[11:51:38] <joepie91> shoky_: with the ability to treat it as if it were the $ object itself, except it starts looking from my .fake-root, instead of the entire DOM
[11:51:48] <joepie91> when using .find etc
[11:51:52] <motaka3> is this the right way to write a plugin? specially I am worried about the event in the end
[11:52:32] <joepie91> er, sorry
[11:52:39] <joepie91> when using $(",selector") etc *
[11:53:25] <joepie91> shoky_: I realize it's a bit of an edge case, but I've not been able to find anything about it, other than the `context` argument which requires explicit specifying at the moment you search for a selector
[11:53:39] <joepie91> so I'm not sure whether it's possible, and if it is, how
[11:54:25] <shoky_> $(selector, context)  literally just does  $(context).find(selector)
[11:54:55] <joepie91> I know.
[11:58:01] <joepie91> shoky_: https://gist.github.com/joepie91/f8d7d9cb403599fb284c
[11:58:03] <joepie91> perhaps that clarifies it more
[12:05:46] <santosh> My image url is item.media.m which I am using `$( "<img>" ).attr( "src", item.media.m ).appendTo( "#images" );` to show images on webpage. But now I want to anchor this image to data.items[i]['link']. Everythis is going inside a loop fyki
[12:06:09] <santosh> everything*
[12:12:22] <shoky_> joepie91: can't think of a nice/clean way. i assume this is hardly good enough :D  http://jsfiddle.net/mc451r14/
[12:13:05] <santosh> I think I am very close to my solution
[12:13:40] <santosh> so can anyone tell me how to creata an img element inside an anchor element>
[12:14:34] <joepie91> shoky_: hmm... that might actually work. if I instead make `fake` a wrapper function that only adds a context when 1) a string selector is provided and 2) no context is specified, and otherwise just passes it through... then I think it'd work, right?
[12:14:42] <joepie91> it's a bit hacky, but can't see it breaking easily
[12:15:28] <shoky_> dunno, not sure i'd feel too great about using it seriously :)
[12:15:58] <joepie91> shoky_: any saner solutions are welcome :P
[12:35:16] <grr> I have a bunch of images (and thumbnails of them) and want to display them as image grid (all slots same size) and when you click on one, render it full size with fwd/back navigation.
[12:35:42] <grr> That sounds like a very standard problem, but googling I couldn't find any suitable jQuery plugin or whatever so far
[12:35:46] <grr> I would appreciate pointers
[13:49:54] <_u2pop_> hello all
[13:50:02] <BillCriswell> grr: Google "lightbox".
[13:50:05] <_u2pop_> did that line have something wrong?
[13:50:06] <_u2pop_> var row = $('<tr></tr>').addClass('row').append(highlightCell, nameCell, descriptionCell, usersNumbersCell);
[13:50:19] <_u2pop_> console.log($(row).html());
[13:50:42] <_u2pop_> the console.log lost me <tr></tr>
[13:51:02] <BillCriswell> _u2pop_: Is highlightCell, etc what ou think they are?
[13:51:14] <BillCriswell> Also, are you appending the row somewhere to see it?
[13:52:43] <_u2pop_> ah done i fixed it ty anyway BillCriswell :P
[13:52:52] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[14:05:30] <grr> BillCriswell: That's a useful pointer, thank you.
[14:05:45] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[14:22:53] <bjensen82> when I update a element with $(element).attr("data-score", new_value) I can see in my browser that the value is updated..however when I try to read it afterwards with element.attr("data-score") then it returns the old value..what am I doing wrong?
[14:29:00] <rcyr> bjensen82: Unless you use a jQuery version that is prehistoric, it should work
[14:29:44] <bjensen82> rcyr: which version of jquery are we talking? :-)
[14:29:56] <rcyr> 1.4.x
[14:30:19] <rcyr> bjensen82: Just test it in your console: jQuery.fn.jquery
[14:30:35] <rcyr> After you press enter, it should show you what version you use.
[14:30:38] <bjensen82> "1.10.0"
[14:30:44] <rcyr> That's recent.
[14:31:09] <bjensen82> right..well if I look in the DOM using the console I can see its changed..but when I do the .attr its not..
[14:31:33] <bjensen82> like its pulling a cached version..
[14:31:52] <rcyr> http://jsfiddle.net/hgqo35v7/ It works here
[14:36:27] <bjensen82> hmm weird..
[15:41:53] <Forbidd3n> anyone here use jvectormap that can help me on how to change the series and regions on drilled down map, please? http://jvectormap.com/examples/drill-down/

[20:35:02] <DarkSector> What is a good way to get the element containing html "foo"
[20:35:19] <DarkSector> I can only think of looping through all the elements and checking agains the string
[20:35:39] <DarkSector> basically I have a list and I am trying to highlight the page number by adding class active
[20:41:20] <ngharo> $('#parent').find(":contains('foo')")
[20:41:42] <ngharo> https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[20:43:29] <rcyr> People should really know that it's a bad pattern.
[20:43:40] <rcyr> If you need to do that, you did something wrong.
[20:44:11] <DarkSector> rcyr, so any suggestions on how to do it right?
[20:44:19] <DarkSector> should my li elements have a data attribute?
[20:44:25] <rcyr> Yup :)
[20:44:53] <rcyr> Your selections should be based off the structure of the document, not its content.
[20:44:58] <DarkSector> got it
[20:45:08] <DarkSector> Well, I'll have to change a lot of stuff, but hey that's worth it
[20:45:33] <rcyr> It leads to less fragile, more maintainable code.
[20:51:00] <DarkSector> rcyr, okay so to find an element with the data-page-number, I should be doing $("#parent").find()?
[20:51:03] <DarkSector> find what exactly?
[20:51:32] <DarkSector> $(this).attr("data-page-number") == 2?
[20:51:38] <DarkSector> No that's not how it works
[20:51:45] <rcyr> DarkSector: $('#parent').find('[data-page-number="2"]')
[20:51:48] <DarkSector> ah
[20:51:54] <DarkSector> gotch
[20:52:06] <DarkSector> thanks rcyr
[20:55:37] <DarkSector> Ah, my pagenumbers are Number()
[20:55:50] <DarkSector> is that going to affect the find() method?
[20:56:10] <ngharo> if you're taggin elements in natural order, you may be able to get away with $collection.index(n)
[20:56:46] <DarkSector> good point
[22:11:50] <cuppy> Is there a way to select all elements between two specified elements? Like something using both :before and :after ... hopefully there's something like :between[#ele1, #ele2]?
[22:12:47] <cuppy> I just began looking ... found this so far: http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[22:16:47] <Uhkis> nextuntil doesnt select children tho
