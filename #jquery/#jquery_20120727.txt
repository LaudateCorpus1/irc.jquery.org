[00:00:53] <ENQ> here some example azbyin http://forum.jquery.com/topic/firing-an-event-on-addclass
[00:02:45] <zxc> The event binding methods already do add the evt handler, they don't replace
[00:03:01] <azbyin> ok, thanks
[00:09:05] <azbyin> ENQ, that f.j.c thread looks interesting with attrchange and csschange events
[00:09:45] <ENQ> yes, you can go more specific if you need it, like onShow or onHide
[00:11:08] <ENQ> try to google the must be working examples
[00:11:28] <ENQ> migh share if  you find anything or make a solution :)
[00:14:04] <zucchero> Hi, making an ajax call, returning a json string, updating some divs. All divs were updated when using FF 3.24 legacy. Using modern FF, one div does NOT update. Currentl using the "evalJSON()" method in prototype to parse the json string. I figure if it was a cross domain thing, no div would update....
[00:15:30] <ENQ> zucchero, try to set ajax options crossDomain = true
[00:18:33] <zucchero> sorry, ENQ, but where would I do this? I can show you the js handler if that helps me
[00:18:42] <ENQ> shure
[00:19:06] <ENQ> can do $.ajaxSetup({crossDomain: true}); to set it globaly
[00:19:12] <zucchero> what's the paste url for this channel?
[00:19:31] <ENQ> mostly http://fiddle.jshell.net/
[00:22:50] <zucchero> http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/
[00:24:38] <zucchero> it's the query_results div that's not updating, in the if statement
[00:24:40] <zucchero> if (json.mode != "browse"){
[00:24:41] <zucchero> 		blah, blah	
[00:24:43] <zucchero> 		document.getElementById("query_results").innerHTML = "<h2><i>IUNG DSS" + host + json.fname  + "> : Query details</i></h2></a>";
[00:24:45] <zucchero> 		}
[00:25:45] <ENQ> zucchero, you dont use jquery do you?
[00:26:18] <zxc> as a side note, I that line appears to have an extra </a>
[00:28:00] <zucchero> sorry, no, not yet :-(  went to the prototype channel yesterday, and it says "Use jQuery" so I'm here.. Anyway, the jquery site says this channel is also for js programming in general
[00:28:51] <ENQ> zucchero, im not shure what that code do..
[00:31:02] <zucchero> anyway, the code parses a json string that returns, and updates some divs (.innerHTML).. the div query_results in the if statement does not update with new FF, but does with old Firefox
[00:32:07] <ENQ> so the problem isnt in thiss code, is it? are you getting any response?
[00:34:54] <zucchero> Yes, as I said, only that  one div is not updating
[00:37:26] <zucchero> Ok, how can I see the ajax response from my call, with firebug?
[00:38:02] <ENQ> turn it, and youll see
[00:38:31] <ENQ> something like GET http//some_fancy_url.com
[00:41:55] <zucchero> via firebug, the response is ok, the json string is correct
[00:43:26] <ENQ> zucchero, try to console.log(json) in handleJson()
[00:43:31] <ENQ> something isnt right
[00:44:57] <zucchero> Ok, here's the calling function, http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/1/
[00:46:12] <zucchero> firebug points to the "req.send(null);" line... I don't know if it's an error, or what???
[00:50:42] <ENQ> why you req.send(null)?
[00:50:52] <kreantos> hi, does one of you know a good library for a dropdown multiselect?
[00:51:33] <zucchero> I dont know anymore, I wrote this about 2 years ago.. and only now I see it doesnt work  with modern ff
[00:58:50] <kaputtmacher> hi there
[00:59:08] <kaputtmacher> i need some help on dealing with contexts
[00:59:26] <kaputtmacher> i have a template with three rows .row-fluid
[00:59:28] <zucchero> well, it does not work without "req.send(null)  there....
[00:59:44] <kaputtmacher> now i want the content of these rows to have equal height
[01:00:16] <kaputtmacher> but each row-fluid has a different height, how can i tell my function to focus only on the content of the current row-fluid ?
[01:00:28] <ENQ> zucchero, i have no idea how to solve it, but in jquery this would take like 10 lines of code
[01:01:59] <NodeX> kaputtmacher : what is the "current" row-fluid ??
[01:03:41] <kaputtmacher> NodeX: that's the point
[01:04:00] <kaputtmacher> how can i tell query only to watch for the current row-fluid and it's height
[01:04:41] <NodeX> I dont understand what the CURRENT one is?
[01:04:45] <NodeX> how is it defined?
[01:07:33] <kaputtmacher> NodeX: this is my code http://pastebin.com/TEkLMFbn
[01:08:24] <kaputtmacher> he problem is, all well's accros different row-fluids get the same height instead only the one of the parent row-fluid
[01:19:34] <NodeX> kaputtmacher : again, what DEFINES current?
[01:23:12] <Kingsy> is anyone aware of a decent content slider.. it has to do element fading on all browsers apart from IE6
[01:23:21] <Kingsy> so IE 7 8 9
[01:27:49] <mbn_18> Hi, I am searching for Jquery plugin that will let me filter and sort table rows. Any recommendations?

[01:31:12] <Fab700> Hi all, help for IE bug on jquery ui
[01:31:26] <Fab700> SCRIPT16389: Erreur non spécifiée.
[01:31:33] <coldhead> sadly not, zxc, he wants a fully fleshed plugin with CSS and all that he can install in under 30 seconds and charge his client vast amounts for
[01:32:28] <Fab700> my bug is only on IE, bug about every 2 seconds without script recurrent
[01:32:39] <Fab700> see at www.ekds.fr
[01:34:58] <Fab700> plz can help me ?
[01:36:04] <zxc> how do you know it is jquery ui's bug?
[01:36:56] <Fab700> not sure, i can't know where is the problem
[01:37:06] <Fab700> on firefox, chrome, etc. there is no problem
[01:37:39] <Fab700> on IE 9 (sic...) the problem turn every 1 or 2 seconds on my webpage
[01:37:52] <Fab700> i use the console for catch the error
[01:37:55] <fRAiLtY-> Morning, http://jsfiddle.net/t22xZ/11/ trying to get it so each time an option is selected in eq1 (second select) it adds to day count but not incrementally, so 2+1 = 3 then if you swap options it doesn't then do 3+1 it "resets" to it's starting place
[01:41:24] <zxc> well fab700, I don't have IE, but I guess some alert()-style debugging could help you
[01:41:45] <Nirvanko> Is it possible to select a date range in datepicker?
[01:41:49] <Fab700> 'fRailty if you click direct on you second select you have an error [var not exist])
[01:42:01] <Nirvanko> Not a single day but a range of days.
[01:42:09] <zxc> typically, when an error isn't caught, then it stops js execution, so you could test whether a given point is reached
[01:42:17] <zxc> to narrow the pr0oblem
[01:43:38] <Fab700> thx nxv but there is no js error because script is fully work. Only this error appear every 2 seconds without recurrent script on my website
[01:43:53] <Fab700> see yourself with another navigator
[01:45:41] <zxc> hrm, 'SCRIPT16389: Erreur non spécifiée.' suggests the opposite
[01:45:51] <Fab700> @<fRAiLtY-> if you use a "global" var as dayCount we should put out of method otherwise at the end of the function the var is reset
[01:45:51] <b-ot> Fab700, memorised “var”.
[01:45:55] <zxc> I see no error in Chrome
[01:46:09] <zxc> fab700, it also occurs in IE with javascript disabled?
[01:46:27] <Fab700> hep not in Chrome and not in Firefox
[01:46:52] <Fab700> i'll try but it's an "error" from Jquery.UI ... without javascript...
[01:47:09] <zxc> how do you know it's from jquery ui?
[01:48:05] <fRAiLtY-> Fab700:  Can you show me on the fiddle?
[01:48:46] <Fab700> see on IE console
[01:49:04] <Fab700> jquery-ui-1.8.22.custom.min.js, Ligne 73 Caractère 5496
[01:49:16] <fRAiLtY-> me?
[01:49:52] <zxc> frailty-: http://jsfiddle.net/t22xZ/11/
[01:50:19] <zxc> oh, that's a more precise error message
[01:51:44] <zxc> well, now it's just a matter of while (get error) { strip down more and more script; }
[01:52:15] <fRAiLtY-> zxc:  That's the same fiddle I posted?
[01:52:45] <zxc> frailty-: sorry, I dod not fork http://jsfiddle.net/FYAVf/
[01:53:09] <Zhy> Hey everybody - can I safely assume that I'm right to hate IE when my scripts work in Chrome and FF but not the least bit in IE ? ;_;
[01:53:20] <Kingsy> zxc: naa I was hoping to get something pre written.. like a plugin
[01:53:22] <zxc> was saying...  then get the smallest portion of code that  generates the error, then ask for it here into a fiddle
[01:54:28] <fRAiLtY-> zxc It's still just incrementing
[01:54:33] <coldhead> Zhy: you don't gain much by hating it. try running the script through jshint which can help you catch errors that most browsers are cool with but which upset IE
[01:54:40] <fRAiLtY-> Each time I click a new option in the second select it just adds it up
[01:54:47] <fRAiLtY-> 2,3,5,6,8,9 etc
[01:54:54] <coldhead> http://www.jshint.com/
[01:55:05] <Zhy> kk thx coldhead ... turns out one of the two features I thought wouldn't work in IE worked after I refreshed the page with the console open :0
[01:55:16] <Zhy> but I'll have a look at jshint too, thank you :)
[01:55:20] <zxc> and instead you want...?
[01:55:28] <zxc> to set it?
[01:55:39] <Fab700> if i know the portion of code, i can work, but how found it into all my website... and without recurrent script for an recurrent error every 2 seconds...
[01:55:43] <zxc> as opposed to incrementing?
[01:56:15] <DireFog> hi, under what license are the demos on http://jqueryui.com ? I can't find anything explicit, which makes using them questionable :-/
[01:56:19] <zxc> stip down:= remove a large part, if you still get error, then restore it and try remove another part, and so on
[01:56:39] <Fab700> @Zhy IE can stop the page it you call the console.log function
[01:56:50] <Fab700> try to comment it into code
[01:56:58] <fRAiLtY-> zxc:  Yes, So option 1 sets dayCount to 2, then select 2 either adds 1 or 2 days but if you switch between them it keeps adding?
[01:57:25] <Fab700> @fRaiLty yes for me
[01:57:42] <Zhy> Thanks for the info, Fab700
[01:57:47] <zxc> frailty-: than I'd go with a function dayCount() that computes the value on the fly
[01:57:58] <Fab700> http://jsfiddle.net/t22xZ/12/
[01:59:35] <fRAiLtY-> zxc:  I cannot as dayCount is linked elsewhere in my actual script, this is the last stage
[01:59:40] <fRAiLtY-> I have to work on this theory
[01:59:42] <soee> hi, if i have text (page content get through curl) can i somehow using jquery operate on it like on dom elements ? for example find in this thext element with di XX
[01:59:57] <masak> is there something pre-built for the case where you want to drag-and-drop something, but the original thing should be cloned and remain in place?
[02:00:28] <zxc> direfog: typically look at the bottom of page. if you find nothing, then assume it's copyrighted. Unless it's not copyrightable because trivial
[02:00:53] <zxc> soee: $("text").whatever
[02:01:16] <DireFog> zxc: that was my approach
[02:01:46] <zxc> frailty-: what about a function updateDayCount() that generates the value on the fly and writes to dayCount?
[02:02:29] <shellox__> hi
[02:03:44] <shellox__> i have a question with to a selection
[02:03:46] <shellox__> https://gist.github.com/3186937
[02:04:14] <shellox__> I want to get the rowindex of the tr, where the link, which i click is in
[02:05:47] <shoky> shellox__: $(this).closest('tr').index()
[02:06:38] <shellox__> shoky: awesome, thanks ;)
[02:07:42] <zxc> mah... .rowIndex works here http://jsfiddle.net/gmB7G/
[02:08:02] <coldhead> I HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS DREAM OF YOU SERENE SURROUNDED IN A SUNFLOWER SEED
[02:09:08] <zxc> sounds like cold head is getting hot :/
[02:14:52] <Fab700> is it possible to have an IE error because two functions which modify dom is too near (and so too fast)
[02:14:55] <Fab700> ?
[02:15:52] <subdesign> anybody using modernizr?
[02:17:07] <zxc> maybe, it's ie after all
[02:17:24] <zxc> @fab
[02:18:31] <zxc> a very small google search returns that IE returns Unknown Error on innerHTML, could it be related?
[02:19:38] <Simoncowell> Hey everyone, it seems as though IE is not running the scripts that are inline which are passed into .html() as part of a html page. Would anyone know why? Chrome is running everything fine..
[02:23:19] <zxc> simoncowell: the ie-specific issue could be *inside* the scripts?
[02:23:58] <majd> Hey #jquery - can someone tell me why this .toggle() example is not behaving as i would expect? http://jsfiddle.net/majdal/WrVb3/1/
[02:25:25] <majd> i expect the first click on a <td> to go into the first <input> the second click to the second <input>, then back to the first, etc...
[02:26:19] <zxc> works for me in chrome
[02:26:23] <shoky> majd it sets a toggle for each <td>
[02:26:39] <shoky> so if you click different ones it'll run the first handler
[02:26:40] <majd> shoky, yes, that's what i want...
[02:26:41] <shoky> for all 4
[02:26:54] <shoky> until you click the same td twice, only then it'll run the second function
[02:27:27] <majd> shoky: aaah! i see
[02:28:01] <Simoncowell> zxc, checking now. Good catch.
[02:28:30] <shoky> majd: http://jsfiddle.net/WrVb3/2/
[02:29:47] <masak> I've managed to create a draggable and a droppable, and .insertBefore(this) inside the 'drop:' function. but the draggable doesn't end up at all where I intend -- it's like it's always at an offset, seeminly corresponding to the offset already dragged. is this normal? is there something I can do about it?
[02:31:08] <majd> shoky: great, thank you!
[02:31:52] <eshlox> i want check if IE window is focused/blured, i found http://wklej.org/id/798656/ but this is also activated when i click on page ;-S ideas how fix this?
[02:32:38] <NodeX> eshlox : how do you think somehting focuses ?
[02:33:02] <majd> shoky: on different level, is it wise to attach a .click() to every single <td> on my table (there are 1000+) ?
[02:33:29] <sacho> why would you want to do that?
[02:34:25] <majd> i'm displaying a spreadsheet as an html table, and i want to allow the user to select two cells that define a range of cells in the table
[02:35:07] <NodeX> err dont setup 1000 binds
[02:35:15] <NodeX> your performance will hit the floor
[02:35:41] <majd> how else could i implement this functionality?
[02:36:35] <zxc> what about attach to the table and getting the cell through event object.target?
[02:36:39] <zxc> attaching*
[02:37:18] <zxc> http://jsfiddle.net/ub7dr/
[02:37:57] <eshlox> NodeX: no idea, f** ie ;-S
[02:39:20] <NodeX> focus is determined when either the page gains focus from alt-tab or a click happend inside $(window)
[02:39:35] <NodeX> in short you cannot stop what you want to stop and there is no reason to
[02:40:07] <zxc> ... looks too weird? or should I explain more?
[02:40:52] <eshlox> NodeX: http://wklej.org/id/798659/ this works in FF and others, it isn't possible in IE? ;-S
[02:40:59] <majd> zxc: i think you meant to attach the event to table instead of td in your response, but yes, that's a great idea, thanks :)
[02:42:09] <NodeX> [10:31:48] <eshlox> i want check if IE window is focused/blured, i found http://wklej.org/id/798656/ but this is also activated when i click on page ;-S ideas how fix this?
[02:42:11] <zxc> oh k
[02:42:19] <NodeX> you mentioened nothing about it working or not working in IE
[02:42:31] <eshlox> eh
[02:42:34] <eshlox> ok
[02:43:59] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/798659/ whit works in FF but not in IE, this works http://wklej.org/id/798656/ in IE but i want stop this if i click on page
[02:44:47] <NodeX> why do you want it to stop when you click on the page?
[02:46:08] <zxc> maybe he means clicking while the page already hsa focus
[02:46:12] <zxc> has
[02:46:38] <NodeX> I realise that but why, it makes no difference whether the page has or doesn't have focus
[02:47:06] <NodeX> the event fires no matter what, it's the function it fires that should determine what to do
[02:50:02] <zxc> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3737175/window-onfocus-not-firing-in-ie7-inconsistent-in-opera here it says "focusin and focusout, unlike focus and blur, are propagating events; they will fire for elements in the page and bubble upwards" could this be relevant?
[02:52:42] <Fab700> anyone know the reason to IE 9 to reload my website in infinite loop (and not firefox or chrome) ?
[02:57:05] <bjensen> select change does not work with .on ?
[02:57:36] <NodeX> it does
[02:57:58] <NodeX> $().on('change','selector',function(){...});

[03:18:53] <HaxtonFale> Hello
[03:21:06] <HaxtonFale> I have this selector
[03:21:45] <HaxtonFale> I'm trying to get all input fields that come in HTML through AJAX
[03:21:48] <HaxtonFale> $("input#"+car+".date")
[03:22:21] <HaxtonFale> ('car' is a variable, since there are several tables to load from, and those input fields are inside those tables)
[03:22:27] <HaxtonFale> But it doesn't seem to load any data
[03:32:48] <HaxtonFale> ...anyone?
[03:32:58] <Elephphant> sec just reading :)
[03:35:31] <ENQ> HaxtonFale, you load it, ten do like $(loaded_data).filter("input#"+car+".date");
[03:35:38] <ENQ> then*
[03:35:39] <ENQ> ?
[03:35:40] <Elephphant> You are trying to to get an id of an input :    get all inputs with id of car's value which also has the class of date]
[03:37:41] <HaxtonFale> I load the data and then do $.each($("input#"+car+".date"), function() {and the rest goes here});
[03:38:33] <HaxtonFale> And the same for $("input#"+car+".realn"), because there are three kinds of fields
[03:39:06] <shoky> $('#'+car).each(function() { ... })
[03:39:28] <HaxtonFale> I'm trying to get the values of input fields with ID equal to the variable car and with the class of 'date' or 'realn'
[03:39:47] <shoky> multiple elements with the same ID?
[03:39:53] <HaxtonFale> Yes.
[03:39:56] <shoky> no good.
[03:40:03] <shoky> ID is for identity, yes ?
[03:40:25] <shoky> be good
[03:40:28] <HaxtonFale> I think so, yes
[03:40:47] <shoky> no two elements should have the same ID
[03:41:41] <shoky> they could share a class, though
[03:44:13] <HaxtonFale> So I should use names?
[03:44:49] <HaxtonFale> I need two variables
[03:45:11] <shoky> best if you use classes
[03:45:17] <HaxtonFale> However...
[03:45:27] <HaxtonFale> Damn, why didn't I notice it earlier?
[03:45:42] <HaxtonFale> I can always make the class car+'date'
[03:45:55] <shoky> no
[03:46:01] <shoky> use multiple classes
[03:46:05] <shoky> as many as you want
[03:46:07] <shoky> that's what they're for
[03:46:25] <shoky> you can then $('.' + car + '.date')
[03:46:33] <shoky> to select elements of both classes
[03:47:39] <HaxtonFale> How should I declare the field? class="$car date"?
[03:47:40] <shoky> tho i donno what your car variable has
[03:47:59] <shoky> maybe just a data-X attribute will be ok too
[03:47:59] <HaxtonFale> It's a 5 character string (number)
[03:48:17] <HaxtonFale> What's that?
[03:48:31] <HaxtonFale> data-X?
[03:50:05] <shoky> <input data-car="someCar" class=".date"> or someth
[03:50:08] <NodeX> data-* is the accepted way
[03:50:24] <shoky> but classes get selected faster ;P
[03:53:00] <sunbeam> When focused in a certain form (input fields filling etc), when enter is pressed, i'd like to prevent submitting the form, but instead, $(".next") being clicked
[03:53:11] <sunbeam> how can i do this best?
[03:54:32] <sahbeewah> $(form_selector).submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('.next').trigger('click'); } );
[03:56:47] <sunbeam> so when i am focused in a form
[03:56:53] <sunbeam> and i press enter, it will 'click' .next ?
[03:57:47] <sahbeewah> depends on what is in the form
[03:58:52] <sahbeewah> $(form_selector).keypress(function(e) { if (e.which == 13) { ... } );
[03:58:59] <sahbeewah> i think it's 13
[03:59:38] <sahbeewah> to capture explicitly, regardless of content, which will be pretty gay for textareas
[04:00:06] <Elephphant> I have an isssue with setTimeouts in a getJson rturn function - Where it sits in looping the data is in the pastebin. It works ok on 1 element but not if there is more then one - http://pastebin.com/7b6ydBGp

[04:05:41] <_dave_h_d> hi all is there a way of getting a LARGE fb like button from Facebook for a touch device (mobile safari browsrer), the ones we get from here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/ are tiny
[04:08:19] <shoky> zoom: 700%
[04:12:19] <_dave_h_d> shoky: thank you very much, could you please tell me where one adds that property?
[04:12:59] <EnginA> var foo = {a: 'b', factory: SomeFunc}; $(elm).data('data', foo); // and then... `new $(elm).data().factory()` does not work.
[04:13:04] <EnginA> is that to be expected
[04:13:10] <_dave_h_d> shoky: we tried in here: <div class="fb-like" data-send="true" data-width="450" data-show-faces="true" ></div> it docent work
[04:13:10] <Kingsy> anyone in here used anythingSlider ?
[04:13:17] <EnginA> i can see it in the debugger that the factory is the correct function
[04:15:26] <shoky> _dave_h_d: i was actually joking..
[04:16:05] <Kingsy> nevermind
[04:16:39] <shoky> _dave_h_d: but i was referring to the css zoom..  .fb-like { zoom: 700% }   :P
[04:18:19] <sahbeewah> EnginA: you need to reference the data you attached to elm
[04:18:33] <sahbeewah> so, new $(elm).data('data').factory()
[04:19:23] <_dave_h_d> shoky: you can't do that right because the css is pulled from fb
[04:20:19] <Nthan> Hey - Just wondered if anyone knows how to close a Jquery accordion using a selector...?
[04:20:21] <shoky> _dave_h_d you can add your own css..
[04:20:24] <aquatix> _dave_h_d: random thought, but can't you use that zoom on the container?
[04:20:36] <_dave_h_d> no
[04:20:41] <aquatix> k
[04:20:52] <_dave_h_d> because fb javascript reduces it down
[04:20:54] <aquatix> or indeed, use your own css with the fb classes
[04:20:58] <aquatix> oh right
[04:23:53] <r3v3rb> morning all
[04:24:08] <hirsty> hi all im using a jquery datepicker and on scrolling through the months it seems to get sluggish and then eventually crashes can i optimize it somehow?
[04:25:26] <hirsty>  its onSelect has an AJAX call which is needed
[04:25:59] <hirsty> i do alsouse the beforeShowDay function
[04:26:36] <hirsty> would be happy if anyone could help :D if needed i can pastie my code - will share upon request
[04:29:46] <hirsty> would be glad if anyone could help :) it appears not to be my functions as ive commented these out and still experience lag using jquery 1.7.2
[04:29:48] <Kingsy> guys, if .css("background-image"); returns    url("http://whatever.com/skin/frontend/default/qp/images/image_slider/2.jpg")      what would be the best way of getting the "2.jpg" out of that big path ?
[04:31:03] <hirsty> Kingsy use a substring with a position of the "/"?
[04:32:37] <hirsty> starting from the end and working your way backwards
[04:34:05] <sunbeam> sahbeewah: there are no textareas
[04:34:08] <sunbeam> sahbeewah: is it fine then or?
[04:34:15] <r3v3rb> is it possible to stall jquery until after .each has returned all the elements so that I can be sure my stored height is the maximum of all li's on the page
[04:36:13] <faraway> r3v3rb: what do you mean with stall ?
[04:36:55] <Kingsy> hirsty: umm cool.. let me google around
[04:36:55] <hirsty> r3v3rb if u want to see all your heights, use alert(variable) in the loop :D
[04:37:02] <r3v3rb> i need to get the max height of all li's in the page then animate the rest to that height. but in my code it seems to fire before max has reached the end
[04:37:06] <faraway> hirsty: :P
[04:37:11] <hirsty> ?
[04:37:16] <faraway> hirsty: that can get funny :D
[04:37:22] <hirsty> :P
[04:37:25] <r3v3rb> hirsty: I can get the heights no problem
[04:37:46] <r3v3rb> faraway: but the animate fires whilst the each is doing its thing
[04:37:49] <hirsty> so whats ur problem?
[04:37:59] <r3v3rb> so it might get one height for max or another
[04:38:11] <sahbeewah> sunbeam: if there is only one text field in the form, then it's preferable to use the submit handler, because pressing enter submits the form
[04:38:19] <hirsty> i shouldnt be on here really....im at work rofl
[04:38:28] <Kingsy> hirsty: same :)
[04:38:29] <sahbeewah> sunbeam: but if there are multiple, then you need to use the keypress handler
[04:38:35] <pachet> wait, we're not supposed to be on irc when we're at work?
[04:38:38] <pachet> ohshi--
[04:38:51] <faraway> r3v3rb: each is not interrupted by an animation and the code right after the each will be executed after you have seen all elements the query matche
[04:38:52] <aquatix> oh hm :)
[04:38:53] <faraway> d
[04:39:06] <hirsty> found my lag problem....was loading two versions of jquery >.>
[04:39:49] <hirsty> 1.3 n 1.7.2 lol
[04:39:50] <r3v3rb> faraway: so my each loop for finding the height will always complete before my next each loop to animate the heights? correct
[04:40:16] <hirsty> r3v3rd pastie it so we can look ? :D
[04:40:25] <hirsty> r3v3rb*
[04:40:25] <faraway> r3v3rb: without the code its hard to say
[04:40:38] <hirsty> pastie .org
[04:40:42] <hirsty> i think
[04:40:44] <hirsty> >.>
[04:40:51] <r3v3rb> faraway: http://jsfiddle.net/66nTj/
[04:41:56] <r3v3rb> hirsty: jsfiddle :D is awesome
[04:42:05] <faraway> r3v3rb: what should the first each loop do ?
[04:42:20] <hirsty> i know i used it to put events into my datepicker from a mysql db :D
[04:42:25] <r3v3rb> get the max height from the li.ob_product's
[04:42:46] <faraway> r3v3rb: with that code you get the height of the last one ;)
[04:42:50] <r3v3rb> shoot, its overriding them in each loop
[04:42:53] <r3v3rb> of course
[04:44:00] <hirsty> <--- PHP but to get the height couldny u loop and store the heights in an array?
[04:44:02] <r3v3rb> faraway: this appears to work better ;)
[04:44:03] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/66nTj/1/
[04:44:43] <hirsty> meh shutup hirsty n get back to work >.>
[04:45:51] <faraway> r3v3rb: was this the problem ?
[04:46:17] <r3v3rb> it was - i was being stooooopid
[04:46:38] <faraway> r3v3rb: yes this is a real problem, if it is so :P
[04:46:45] <hirsty> might keep this irc open.....just in case
[04:46:53] <zucchero> I was wonder in the ajax method, where you define the callback function, e.g. success: function(data){    //do your stuff with the JSON data }... what is the syntax if you want to use an external function (already defined)
[04:47:06] <r3v3rb> one slight problem is that sometimes the 'typekit' font isn't loaded before the jquery fires - grrrr
[04:47:27] <r3v3rb> so the height isn't quite correct due to font line-heights etc etc
[04:47:29] <r3v3rb> nm
[04:48:10] <ajax__> hi
[04:48:14] <hirsty> i use ajax with POST data >.>
[04:48:27] <ajax__> handling NetworkError: 404 Not Found in jquery ajax
[04:48:35] <ajax__> how to handling NetworkError: 404 Not Found in jquery ajax???????
[04:49:07] <ajax__> any one pls answer!!
[04:49:14] <zucchero> anyone?
[04:49:59] <pachet> ajax__: point to a file that exists?
[04:50:01] <sahbeewah> zucchero: just call the function?
[04:50:21] <ajax__> how to handling NetworkError: 404 Not Found in jquery ajax???????
[04:50:48] <shoky> zucchero:  success: myFunction
[04:50:50] <pachet> ajax__: good lord. that's not enough information
[04:50:52] <faraway> zucchero: you can either pass an anonymous function like you wrote, or you can pass it by name e.g. function foo(data) {}   $.getJSON("…",foo);
[04:50:59] <pachet> ajax__: you probably just specified the path wrong
[04:51:23] <shoky> zucchero:  or nicer:   $.ajax(...).done(myFunction)
[04:51:24] <ajax__> ya the url is wrong, but how can we handle?
[04:51:26] <zucchero> as in
[04:51:28] <zucchero>  dataType: "json",
[04:51:29] <zucchero>  success:HandleJson
[04:51:31] <zucchero> });
[04:51:38] <shoky> that's fine
[04:51:49] <shoky> if HandleJson  is  function(data)
[04:52:21] <shoky> zucchero: anywhere in javascript that you can put an anonymous function, you can also put a named function
[04:52:44] <pachet> ajax__: that's what the 'error' property of the ajax init object is for
[04:53:12] <pachet> ajax__: $.ajax({url:'foo.php', success : function(){}, error : function(){} });
[04:53:22] <ajax__> $.ajax({ 		url: 'http://www.test.com', 		crossDomain: true,                 dataType:'jsonp',		                 timeout: 1000, 		success : function(resp) { 		console.log(resp); 		}, 		 		error : function(resp) { 		console.log("erro"+resp); 		} 		});
[04:53:41] <pachet> please don't paste multiline code in the channel
[04:53:46] <pachet> ?paste @ ajax__
[04:53:47] <bot-t> ajax__, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:54:11] <EnginA> sahbeewah: very same thing
[04:56:16] <ajax__> @pachet even we write error function, we get error as network 404
[04:56:46] <pachet> don't know what that means
[04:57:35] <zucchero> Here's a bit of it...  http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/3/ req is the request object created by the createXMLHttpRequest() function...
[04:57:37] <zucchero> the handleJson basically parses the returned json string and updates divs. Mix of raw xmlHttpRequest, prototype etc. Looking to clean all this up with jQuery...
[04:58:55] <zucchero> the evalJSON() is a prototype method
[04:59:08] <ajax__> @pachet here is code http://jsfiddle.net/qjMey/
[04:59:09] <b-ot> ajax__, memorised “here”.
[05:00:25] <ajax__> anybody help http://jsfiddle.net/qjMey/, getting Network error 404
[05:00:56] <faraway> ajax__: on which browser/device ?
[05:01:06] <ajax__> firefox, ie
[05:01:38] <ajax__> #faraway if the url doesn't exist, am getting that error
[05:02:23] <faraway> ajax__: 404 means  page not found, anyway .. where/how do you get this message ? where do you read this ?
[05:03:12] <ajax__> firebug console, if IE6 am getting error alert
[05:06:46] <pachet> ajax__: but your issue is that the url you requested in that fiddle DOES exist

[05:16:25] <Afflicto> I'm developing a CMS -- in the group-based permission system I have event listeners and ajax post events for each single permission node TIMES the amount of groups. is that a good idea -- It's kinda laggy. Is it possible to create 1 event listener that figures out which specific node was clicked and whether it was on or off previously?
[05:19:29] <sahbeewah> yes you can use event delegation to handle this
[05:19:32] <sahbeewah> ?on
[05:19:32] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:20:43] <Afflicto> I have used .on() before.. so I can bind an event to a class (which all the perm nodes have) and then inside the .on event I can do some logic that figures out the exact perm that was clicked?
[05:21:36] <sahbeewah> no you need to use .on() on a parent element common to all your nodes
[05:22:23] <sahbeewah> $(parent_to_node_selector).on('click', '.node', function(e) { // do something like ajax.. you can reference the node by $(this) or e.target } );
[05:22:23] <Afflicto> ah ok
[05:22:33] <gnarf> parent.on( "change", ".checkbox-class", function( event ) { this === changed box } );
[05:22:52] <gnarf> suggest using "change" if its a checkbox to get tab/spacebar peeps
[05:23:40] <Afflicto> It's actually not a checkbox but I guess it should be. I can probably style that checbox instead. I'm using 2 nice images for on and off. :P
[05:28:07] <johnathanb> I'm doing $.each on an array but would like to do it backwards.
[05:28:10] <johnathanb> $.each( panels, function( index ){
[05:28:40] <johnathanb> Any pointers? Google says .reverse.each() but it's undefined an' all because the thing I'm eaching isn't there..
[05:28:54] <sacho> where does google say that
[05:29:36] <johnathanb> Well on stackoverflow.. But I found it by googling..
[05:30:02] <gnarf> johnathanb: $.each( panels.reverse(), function( index ) { });
[05:30:13] <gnarf> ?mdc Array.reverse
[05:30:14] <bot-t> gnarf, reverse - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Reverses an array in place.  The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse
[05:30:53] <gnarf> johnathanb: careful tho - .reverse() actually changes the array
[05:31:00] <gnarf> if you want to save the original in the right order
[05:31:07] <gnarf> you can .slice().reverse()
[05:31:42] <johnathanb> gnarf: Order doesn't really matter
[05:37:12] <geekluc> How i can get elements added  by the $.append()?
[05:38:01] <sacho> use appendTo
[05:38:36] <geekluc> sacho, is that all?
[05:39:07] <Kingsy> is it possible when I am using this --> jQuery('.slider_wrapper').fadeTo('10', 0, function() { jQuery(this).css('background', 'url(whatever);'); }).fadeTo('50', 1);    <-- something like that.. to ONLY fade if the background you are fading too is different ?
[05:39:11] <Kingsy> does that make sense?
[05:39:16] <zucchero> is there any thing to parse json, like the prototype evalJson() method in jQuery? I want to replace this with jQuery http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/4/
[05:39:28] <Kingsy> the syntax might be wrong in that example.. but you get the idea.. well at least I hope
[05:39:36] <Qiller> hi all
[05:39:45] <Qiller> when I use the scroll bar is to know which div is currently appearing on the page?
[05:42:02] <Kingsy> perhaps using a delay or something would prevent it.. basically its to stop the fade being executed twice on a double click
[05:42:57] <decripter37> hi!
[05:43:10] <Elephphant> hi guys
[05:43:33] <bamarni> hi
[05:43:56] <bamarni> is there a jquery plugin to render some raw text to html smartly? eg transform http://website.com to an <a href=... , transform new lines to <br />?
[05:43:56] <decripter37> I've a problem but I can't paste on jsfiddle because is a json problem
[05:44:30] <decripter37> can I ask here?
[05:45:24] <Elephphant> whats the best way, in an each loop to toggleClass to animate to a class (elm.toggleClass("class",500)) and then setTimout to clear it 2 seconds later (setTimeout(function(){elm.toggleClass("class")}))
[05:51:44] <Afflicto> I'm developing a CMS -- Is it a good idea to have the page content load via ajax? I'm just wondering if there's some downside that I'm not aware of. (I mean.. I have never seen it done before.. almost).
[05:51:55] <Afflicto> For the backend**
[05:52:50] <zucchero> jQuery.parseJSON if anyone is interested
[05:53:49] <shell0x> does live work for new elements?
[05:54:09] <lathan_away> Afflicto, the only potential downside of an ajax heavy page, is that you need to be verry, verry sure that any error the ajax can throw, that you catch it.
[05:54:25] <lathan_away> Afflicto, nothing worse than a heavily ajax-enabled page with javascript all error'd out
[05:54:40] <shell0x> i have this line in my document ready block: $('.del_tr').on('click', function() { $(this).closest('tr').remove(); });
[05:55:05] <decripter37> zucchero: you saved my life :D
[05:55:06] <shell0x> it removes the closest table row and it works with elements, which exists from the loading of the page
[05:55:11] <lathan_away> shell0x, yes, live does. However, if you are using jQuery 1.7 live is old, it has been replaced by "on": http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:55:25] <shell0x> but it doesn't work with newly added elements
[05:55:38] <shell0x> they just get no event handler attached :/
[05:55:42] <majd> is there a way to make .selectable() a two-step process? instead of being triggered by onmousedown and onmouseup, being triggered by click and click?
[05:55:46] <Afflicto> lathan_away: Hm. you mean if the ajax failes to load pages etc?
[05:55:49] <lathan_away> shell0x, $('div#parent_container').on('click','.del_tr',function(){...});
[05:56:04] <lathan_away> Afflicto, yes...if the connection fails, if your server fails....
[05:56:13] <lathan> oops...left the _away on
[05:56:44] <shell0x> lathan: whats the difference to  $('.del_tr').on('click', function() { $(this).closest('tr').remove(); }); ?
[05:56:55] <shell0x> it should work normally, i guess
[05:57:03] <lathan> shell0x, http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[05:57:15] <lathan> Read the Manual...it explains alot
[05:58:16] <shell0x> lathan: but i dont want to add anything, i just want to remove the closest row ;)
[05:58:31] <shell0x> it works with existing elements, but not with new one
[05:58:35] <lathan> shell0x, adding the selector to the .on means it delegates
[05:58:38] <lathan> read the page
[05:58:44] <geekluc> How i can get elements added  by the $.append() and $.appendTo()?
[05:59:01] <lathan> geekluc, there is a difference between $.append() and $('...').append()
[05:59:07] <lathan> there is no $.append or $.appendTo
[05:59:20] <Qiller> can i see if a div actually is show on the page?
[06:00:02] <lathan> Qiller, http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[06:00:27] <geekluc> lathan, i cant get element added by the $.appendTo()
[06:01:18] <lathan> geekluc, there is no $.appendTo() there is a difference between $.something and $('selector').something()
[06:01:39] <lathan> geekluc, you probably want $('#select_an_element').appendTo('#newparent')
[06:02:05] <lathan> geekluc, look at the top two search results: http://api.jquery.com/?ns0=1&s=append&go=
[06:03:27] <geekluc> lathan, my english is very bad. you can clear?
[06:03:27] <decripter37> How I can remove all the options of a multioption select?
[06:03:43] <geekluc> lathan, *more clear
[06:03:51] <Qiller_> lathan: this function show if this div is actually visible on the page when i use scroll bar?
[06:04:08] <lathan> Qiller_, oh...scroll...no, look up jquery.inview.js
[06:04:17] <lathan> Qiller_, a plugin that checks that for you
[06:04:33] <lathan> geekluc, what are you trying to do?
[06:04:36] <Qiller_> example, i use scroll to down if this div is show on the page, alert('div show'), if i show to up and this div hide alert('div hidding')
[06:04:38] <Qiller_> ok, i go to see it
[06:05:02] <Qiller_> ok, going to check it
[06:05:18] <lathan> geekluc, if you have a div#div_to_move and div#new_parent. to move #div_to_move under #new_parent do this: $('#div_to_move').appendTo('#new_parent')
[06:05:20] <geekluc> lathan, i think i understend. $('<div id="foo"></div>').appendTo('#element') is wrong?
[06:05:32] <lathan> geekluc, nope. that's perfect
[06:05:50] <lathan> geekluc, that will work
[06:05:59] <geekluc> lathan, you can see my code?
[06:06:26] <lathan> the div id="foo" appendTo #element? yes
[06:06:40] <geekluc> lathan, http://pastebin.com/wtikKgCk
[06:06:53] <lathan> geekluc, checking...
[06:06:57] <geekluc> lathan, $.mouseenter dont work
[06:07:24] <lathan> geekluc, the mouseenter won't work because you are dynamically adding the div.u
[06:07:30] <lathan> are you using jQuery 1.7? or older?
[06:08:09] <lathan> geekluc, what you need is event delegation. in older versions that is "live" or "delegate". in newer versions they have been combined into "on"
[06:08:10] <geekluc> lathan, exact! i am using jquery 1.7
[06:09:06] <zucchero> Anybody care to checkover  my first ever jquery code http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/5/  ajax call to update some divs???
[06:09:53] <johnkpaul> zucchero: since you're passing dataType:json, you don't need to parseJSON yourself
[06:10:13] <johnkpaul> response should already be a javascript object
[06:10:21] <geekluc> lathan, i can not select element dynamically added?
[06:10:51] <Qiller_> thank lathan its work fine!
[06:11:24] <zucchero> so you are saying this is redundant, "var json = jQuery.parseJSON(response);" and the code should work without it :-)
[06:11:27] <lathan> geekluc, you can. you just have to use "on"
[06:11:32] <lathan> geekluc, I am working up an example
[06:12:19] <mbn_18> I wish to append <input text> into a <td> and set its width to the <td> -10px. Is its possible to get the <td>(parent) width?
[06:12:28] <shell0x> lathan: i got it -.-
[06:12:40] <lathan> geekluc, try playing around with this example...you may not need the mouseenter: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/nJdew/
[06:13:19] <shell0x> lathan: the class of the dynamic added element was .del_tr not .tr_del :P
[06:13:42] <zucchero> johnkpaul??
[06:13:43] <lathan> shell0x, well, then you have an opportunity to think for yourself :P
[06:14:18] <lathan> geekluc, if you really need the mouseenter event....here is how to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/nJdew/1/
[06:14:20] <shell0x> lathan: note: do not use confusing class names ;=
[06:14:45] <lathan> shell0x, I was trying to match your example....but......I'm not really studying each one super-close
[06:14:58] <lathan> geekluc, the manual for "on" is here: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:15:17] <sunbeam> how can i simulate a click on a <a href> again?
[06:15:39] <lathan> sunbeam, .click() or .trigger('click')
[06:15:47] <sunbeam> .trigger('click') on?
[06:15:53] <lathan> sunbeam, personally I think .trigger('click') is more concise
[06:15:53] <geekluc> lathan, i understand. thankyou!
[06:15:59] <johnkpaul> zucchero: that was what I was saying, but I am wrong
[06:16:01] <johnkpaul> something else is up
[06:16:09] <johnkpaul> zucchero: where is "req" defined
[06:16:12] <johnkpaul> you didn't include that in your snippet
[06:16:14] <lathan> sunbeam, $('a').trigger('click',[optional data to pass to event handler]);
[06:16:58] <johnkpaul> zucchero: your code is a syntax error as well, you're not including success:handleJson in the object passed to $.ajax
[06:18:44] <zucchero> sorry, req should not be needed here, it from before where it was a raw created xmlhttprequest object
[06:20:56] <sunbeam> lathan: thanks
[06:21:11] <zucchero> johnkpaul, I thought its in there, on success "success:handleJson"
[06:21:34] <lathan> np
[06:22:52] <zucchero> johnpaul, I'm guessing that the request (the json string) is automatically passed to the function (handleJson) and does not need to be declared as an argument... but I've been wrong before...
[06:23:24] <johnkpaul> zucchero: you are not providing all of your code, or at least, not a swath of code that makes sense on it's own
[06:31:45] <zucchero> johnkpaul, ok, this is what I was doing, and am trying to clean up by using jquery http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/6/ don't laugh please
[06:33:37] <zucchero> I just want to make an ajax call with jquery's $.ajax method, handle the json string to update divs
[06:36:14] <lathan> zucchero, if you are making a jsfiddle, please make it work!! don't put plain text in the javascript area...put it in the html if you'd like...
[06:36:44] <lathan> zucchero, or use javascript comments: /* text */ or // Text
[06:38:41] <Kuro> zucchero: why don't u use $getJson ? => http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[06:38:51] <zucchero> ok, does this help http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/7/
[06:39:33] <lathan> zucchero, yes, ty. now what are you trying to do?
[06:41:04] <zucchero> lathan et.al just trying to clean up that mess by using jquery,  submit a request, and update divs
[06:41:35] <lathan> zucchero, what does getForm do? serialize the fom elements?
[06:41:57] <wroathe> Hey all. I've got a click event handler that fires an ajax request. Problem is if I click the thing multiple times it fires multiple requests and spits out multiple copies of the thing... How can I prevent it from doing that?
[06:42:01] <rethus> i create this vars (above) with php... http://jsfiddle.net/FBM6S/
[06:42:03] <wroathe> I'm a little bit new to events as a whole.
[06:42:18] <rethus> but if i try to access them with firebug, i got undefined. why
[06:45:05] <zucchero> lathan yes, and I've updated the fiddle with jquery approach http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/8/
[06:45:31] <faraway> rethus: how do you try to access them ?
[06:45:53] <rethus> F12 >> Firebug
[06:46:11] <faraway> and there ?
[06:46:18] <rethus> ReferenceError: A_DISPLAY_GsbTab_SchadenFahrer is not defined
[06:46:25] <lathan> zucchero, first of all, the }, after success:handleJson is extra...
[06:46:50] <lathan> zucchero, in handleJson, you are trying to set .replacewith?
[06:47:21] <rethus> faraway: any idea, why this is alway undefined
[06:47:56] <faraway> did you trie it in fiddle or on your page where you got undefined ?
[06:48:10] <rethus> on my page
[06:48:29] <lathan> wroathe, try a throttle plugin
[06:48:35] <faraway> and window.ADEBUG  returns undefined ?
[06:48:56] <rethus> yes
[06:48:57] <lathan> wroathe, I use this plugin: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[06:49:44] <lathan> rethus, you are defining them within a function
[06:49:50] <faraway> hmmm thats strange, beside that fact that you should avoid to pollute the global scope this way it should work.
[06:49:55] <lathan> rethus, that means those variables are defined only inside that function, and not the global scope
[06:50:13] <faraway> lathan: there is no var statment
[06:50:20] <lathan> oh
[06:50:29] <lathan> stupid loose javascript
[06:50:39] <rethus> lathan thats was only a try
[06:51:09] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/FBM6S/3/
[06:51:09] <faraway> rethus: do you know how the scoping of variables in js works ?
[06:51:36] <rethus> thats strange.. it will be shown.... but if i type ADEBUG in firebug, i got refrenece error
[06:51:48] <lathan> rethus, that is because jsfiddle creates an iframe and runs it in there
[06:51:57] <lathan> rethus, firebug is looking in the main page's scope
[06:51:57] <zucchero> latahn, I saw that and corrected it, FWIW, i posted the response i'm handling http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/9/
[06:52:41] <lathan> zucchero, syntax error:     success:handleJson
[06:52:41] <lathan>     *},*
[06:53:16] <lathan> zucchero, then 3 lines down you have the }); so you have: }  }); which is 1 too many curly braces
[06:53:24] <faraway> rethus: thats why i asked if on get this error in jsfiddle
[06:54:21] <zucchero> lathan, I dont get the "set..." I thought that $('queryfile').replaceWith = json.queryfile;  is how you update a div in jquery, and I'll check the stooge :-?
[06:54:45] <lathan> zucchero, no... .replaceWith is a function
[06:55:01] <lathan> zucchero, $('selector').replaceWith(htmlstring or selector)
[06:55:16] <lathan> zucchero, and queryfile is not a valid selector
[06:55:25] <lathan> zucchero, is queryfile an id? if it is then #queryfile
[06:55:50] <zucchero> yes, all those are id's of the divs
[06:56:26] <lathan> zucchero, in prototype $('queryfile') is document.getElementById('queryfile'), in jquery you need $('#queryfile')
[06:56:39] <lathan> zucchero, because jquery will search by id, tagname, class, ......
[06:57:11] <rethus> sorry, realy heavy storm outside... have to turn off my pc. come back later
[06:57:27] <lathan> have fun!
[06:57:39] <rethus> i enjoy the pause :D
[07:02:29] <zucchero> great lathan, so I would do $('#queryfile').innerHTML = json.queryfile ??
[07:03:01] <lathan> zucchero, $('#queryfile').replaceWith(json.queryfile)
[07:03:18] <lathan> zucchero, $('#queryfile')[0].innerHTML = json.queryfile
[07:03:28] <lathan> zucchero, $('#queryfile').html(json.queryfile);
[07:03:48] <lathan> zucchero, replaceWith will replace it. the others will append the new html inside it
[07:04:19] <zucchero> ok, so many options... the second looks like for arrays (select etc..)
[07:05:00] <lathan> zucchero, inside the jQuery object, what you selected is stored in an array, so to get the native HTML object you do access its array
[07:05:16] <zucchero> latahan, I want to replace them.., workin on my fiddle
[07:05:24] <lathan> then do the replaceWith
[07:05:53] <lathan> zucchero, you can just type my name as lat then tab
[07:06:13] <lathan> if you mispell my handle I don't see the notification
[07:06:14] <zucchero> lat
[07:06:40] <lathan> zucchero, your client may not support it then
[07:06:45] <lathan> its called tab completion
[07:06:53] <zucchero> tab didnt work, chatzilla
[07:08:05] <lathan> zucchero, its supposed to: http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/faq/#complete
[07:08:06] <zucchero> lathan, i'm either flashing, or you edited my fiddle :-)
[07:08:32] <lathan> zucchero, if I edit your fiddle, it makes a seperate version uner my account
[07:10:23] <lathan> zucchero, try pressing tab twice for tab completion on my nick
[07:10:53] <zucchero> lathan, I dont have a fiddle account, again, a fiddle noob here
[07:11:40] <lathan> zucchero, fiddle will not let someone save a version without creating a new version number
[07:12:05] <zucchero> lathan, how does this look now http://jsfiddle.net/fcCf8/10/
[07:13:51] <lathan> zucchero, take out the comma after that curly brace...then it will work...but then its the ajax request so you can't test on jsfiddle
[07:14:06] <zucchero> lathan, and is this valid in jquery, var formdata = $("form").serialize();
[07:14:21] <lathan> zucchero, yep
[07:14:36] <lathan> zucchero, you have a typo: you said (son.scalebar instead of (json.scalebar
[07:14:55] <zucchero> lathan, cool, i'll check typo's also...
[07:15:02] <lathan> zucchero, you may also want to escape() that serialized output if you want to put that string in as the paramter string
[07:15:13] <lathan> zucchero, oh nvmind ^^ you handled it
[07:18:01] <invisib> Anyone know of a jQuery plugin that performs actions depending on where you're at on the page? Kinda like https://fiber.google.com/about/
[07:18:38] <invisib> Also, there are some sliders that slide in an image, then slide in some content over it. Anyone know of those plugins?
[07:18:47] <invisib> Had all this stuff bookmarked but lost my bookmarks :(
[07:19:03] <amitprakash> for a form containing inputs, selects and buttons inside spans and divs, is it possible to select all form control elements
[07:19:13] <zucchero> lathan, this is great, I'll upload it to the real server and check it out... It's 5:30 pm here in greece, and time to go, I really appreciate the jump start on jquery bro.. i'll read more docs this weekend...
[07:19:32] <lathan> zucchero, np. great @ docs reading
[07:28:20] <invisib> sequence.js was what I was looking for
[07:28:27] <invisib> For the 2nd plugin
[07:30:46] <lathan> good luck
[07:30:47] <wroathe> Hey all. I've got a click event handler that performs an ajax request. Problem is that if I click on the button multiple times in rapid succession it fires multiple times. What are best practices for preventing the event from firing while the xhr object does it's work?
[07:31:02] <lathan> wroathe, I told you a solution last time
[07:31:17] <wroathe> Oh, sorry. Scrolling up.
[07:31:19] <lathan> wroathe, http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[07:31:25] <lathan> wroathe, its right there ^
[07:32:06] <invisib> And the other plugin I was looking for was scrollorama
[07:33:07] <mikehaas763> On the select event of jquery ui, why does the value of this not work: ui.item.productId, but when I change the Id to id (in the source as well) it works? Are caps not allowed?
[07:34:19] <mikehaas763> does that make sense?
[07:34:30] <lathan> mikehaas763, javascript doesn't care, it should allow caps. but: if jquery ui is creating that you must exactly match what it created
[07:34:39] <lathan> mikehaas763, is that a variable from UI, or something your code added?
[07:35:41] <mikehaas763> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/mikehaas763/JPefV/ thats the whole piece related to the select event
[07:36:19] <mikehaas763> lathan: its made available to me from jquery ui but the last part (.productid/.productId) are variables that I sent back in the JSON datasource
[07:37:04] <lathan> mikehaas763, what method did you use to send them back?
[07:37:36] <mikehaas763> lathan, its a json datasource generated in PHP (the datasource is good, I triple checked)
[07:37:49] <lathan> mikehaas763, no....what part of jQuery UI are you sending it
[07:38:31] <mikehaas763> its just that when I send back the variable productid I can access it with ui.item.productid but when I send back productId the value of ui.item.productId is empty. it makes no sense lol!
[07:38:51] <wendallsan> anyone done any jquery work with the android browser?  I'm trying to build a mobile theme and jquery is not finding elements on the page even though they're displaying . . .
[07:39:36] <lathan> mikehaas763, I'm trying to figure out where in jQuery UI to look for source code to see if UI may be lowercasing it
[07:39:55] <wendallsan> I have an ul#list-services on the page and have put a console.log($('ul#list-services').html()) command in my document.ready() function
[07:40:05] <mikehaas763> lathan, ah! It's ui autocomplete
[07:40:27] <wendallsan> in FF (on my desktop) I get: "<li>...</li>..." as I expect, but on the android browser I get "null"
[07:40:57] <mikehaas763> lathan I just updated the fiddle with the whole javascript
[07:41:08] <mikehaas763> if you care to look
[07:41:47] <lathan> mikehaas763, and the new url is?
[07:41:59] <mikehaas763> same one
[07:42:15] <lathan> mikehaas763, no. its not. anytime you save a fiddle the version number changes
[07:42:18] <wendallsan> the list is being displayed on the page in the android browser, so it's cleary there if it's being rendered . . . but if I do a console.log($('html').html()), the code is nowhere to be found on the page, all I see is the content of the site's hompage, which I'm not even currently on . . .
[07:42:23] <lathan> make sure you hit update, mikehaas763
[07:42:47] <lathan> wendallsan, I'm sorry, but I've never worked with jQuery mobile :(
[07:42:48] <mikehaas763> lathan, ah I see im new to fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/mikehaas763/JPefV/1/
[07:42:55] <masak> what's the return value of .append?
[07:43:02] <masak> the parent?
[07:43:23] <wendallsan> btw. I'm using straight jquery, not messing w/ jquery mobile yet . . .
[07:43:32] <mikehaas763> wendallsan, are you using mobile?
[07:43:35] <mikehaas763> nvm lol
[07:43:37] <pachet> masak: yes
[07:43:50] <pachet> $('#foo').append('#bar') -> '#foo'
[07:43:50] <lathan> wendallsan, well, same thing...I don't know the quirks of mobile devices
[07:44:01] <mikehaas763> wendallsan, maybe you should be using jquery mobile?
[07:44:34] <sunbeam> to read facebook wall messages on my blog
[07:44:37] <lathan> mikehaas763, also with fiddles, change the framework to jquery, and it already puts it in a onload tag
[07:44:43] <sunbeam> i need to fill in some api key
[07:44:45] <sunbeam> any idea why this cannot be done without (public profile)
[07:45:02] <mikehaas763> ah ok
[07:45:23] <lathan> sunbeam, because Facebook doesn't want other servers automatically pining them for data without knowing who they are
[07:45:28] <lathan> *pinging
[07:45:31] <masak> pachet: I want to create the child from a html fragment string, but then I want to do jQuery on this new child. what's the easiest way to do that.
[07:45:46] <masak> ...?
[07:45:51] <lathan> wendallsan, yah...probably some quirk....(keep off the PM please)
[07:47:23] <masak> actually, even better: how do I tell jQuery "I want to create this new DOM object out of this HTML string"?
[07:48:04] <quicksilver> $("<span>this is HTML</span>")
[07:48:07] <sunbeam> lathan: ok thanks
[07:48:12] <sunbeam> lathan: any idea how i can get such api key?
[07:48:15] <quicksilver> masak: ^^
[07:48:20] <masak> quicksilver: ah. thank you.
[07:48:35] <ansimation> i have an obfusciated string like such "4.5m4.5m52.5m51m16m20m50m55.5m49.5m58", anyone familiar with decoding this?
[07:49:02] <masak> quicksilver: so HTML inside the $() is always "create new DOM object", never "go looking for such objects in the DOM"?
[07:49:22] <quicksilver> masak: yes.
[07:50:06] <jonathancutrell> ansimation: where is that string at?
[07:50:20] <jonathancutrell> ansimation: that looks like minutes (length of media)
[07:50:34] <quicksilver> looks like a wordpress hack to me.
[07:50:41] <ansimation> it is, trying to decode it
[07:50:43] <jonathancutrell> ah, yeah.
[07:50:50] <jonathancutrell> ansimation: What do you mean by "decode" it?
[07:50:51] <lathan> sunbeam, sorry, I'm not a FB developer / game maker / ...anything
[07:50:55] * masak got his first DOM Exception 3, ever :)
[07:50:58] <ansimation> http://ninjafirewall.com/malware/index.php?threat=2012-01-05.01
[07:51:04] <masak> I'm on it, though.
[07:51:43] <ansimation> trying to figure out how they got the malware_out version because i have to do something similar
[07:52:16] <quicksilver> just look at how it runs and copy out the decoding code in the script itself.
[07:52:16] <ansimation> interview question
[07:52:19] <quicksilver> but this is really off-topic
[07:52:40] <ansimation> well yeah, #javascript wa sinvite only ;/
[07:53:11] <jonathancutrell> ansimation: Ah. Well, it has to do with the second part of that. n=n[0].split(t);for(i=0;i-n.length<0;i++)ss+=s[f](-h*n[i]);f=ss;e(f);
[07:53:39] <ansimation> alright, thanks
[07:53:56] <NoiseEee> ansimation: ##javascript, and you need to identify with nickserv
[07:54:28] <ansimation> thought i was idented, gues snot
[07:54:31] <sunbeam> lathan: ok
[07:55:05] <lathan> mikehaas763, I'd say check the JSON data.....I don't see any lowercasing happening
[07:57:44] <masak> pro tip: if you want to avoid 'DOM Exception 3', try not to append two DOM nodes to each other.
[07:57:56] * masak grins
[07:59:02] <mikehaas763> lathan, ok I'll check it again thanks for your time
[07:59:08] <lathan> np
[08:07:55] <ansimation> jonathancutrell, thanks, got it figured out :D
[08:12:24] <majd> why does this give me an empty list? i would expect all <td> in the <tr> :                 $("table > tbody > tr:first").filter(' > td')
[08:12:56] <ajpiano> majd: because you can't combine filter with traversal
[08:13:14] <ajpiano> you have a collection of TRs, and you're saying, of all these TRs, filter it to the set of TRs that are also TDs
[08:13:16] <ajpiano> aka, none
[08:13:48] <ajpiano> $("table > tbody > tr").first().children() is probably what you want
[08:15:19] <mbn_18> How can I get the number of the child in its serie? like <td = 0><td = 1><td = 2>
[08:15:35] <Brodingo> wut
[08:15:35] <b-ot> What are those? Is this the morning when we wake up? What's a planet?
[08:15:53] <GoGoGarrett> using the nestedSortable jquery plugin, is there anyway to prevent nested elements from being moved to another "group" of nested elements?
[08:16:27] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/9ee62837365dddc40185
[08:18:06] <dAnjou> hey, can you have a look at this? https://gist.github.com/3188583
[08:18:23] <dAnjou> the curl command works perfectly, but the jquery code does not
[08:19:14] <dAnjou> of course i could do some ugly string manipulation, but that would suck
[08:24:18] <MacroMan> dAnjou: What doesn't work?
[08:25:13] <dAnjou> MacroMan: apparently the backend expects an unescaped string that is json deserializable
[08:25:31] <dAnjou> MacroMan: i posted the request/response info below
[08:26:09] <dAnjou> and jquery (or javascript) encodes the data
[08:27:01] <dAnjou> actual problem: i want jquery to do the same thing like that curl command, because that works
[08:27:19] <dAnjou> here's how the backend works http://flask-restless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/requestformat.html
[08:30:20] <dAnjou> okay, solved: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11216988/jquery-posts-not-working-with-flask-restless-where-curl-h-posts-are
[08:30:47] <chilversc_> anyone know of a browser that allows you to limit the speed of the javascript engine?
[08:30:51] <chilversc_> to simulate a mobile device?
[08:31:24] <dAnjou> chilversc_: *use* a mobile? ^^
[08:31:57] <chilversc_> dAnjou: I did, it runs slowly, now I want to know why
[08:32:04] <dAnjou> chilversc_: or create a virtual machine
[08:32:18] <chilversc_> but I want a tool slightly more comprehensive than just deleting sections of code and seeing if it speeds up
[08:32:40] <masak> I'm having trouble with .blur firing too often. it fires when I <Tab> out of my input field, which is what I want. it also fires when I Alt-Tab to another window, which is not what I want. it also fires (twice!) when I bring up the Developer Tools in Chrome, which I also don't want.
[08:33:30] <masak> is there a way to limit this? or is there some other method I should be aware of? I found .focusout, but that doesn't seem to be what I want either.
[08:36:26] <wendallsan> is there a jquery mobile forum? or is it appropriate to ask jquery mobile-related questions here?
[08:36:32] <Jon47> masak: in all of those scenarios the cursor leaves the input, so blur *should* fire… if you think the cursor shouldn't leave the input in the scenario then you might file a ticket with the chrome/webkit dev teams..
[08:37:04] <warrenparsons> wendallsan: There is a #jquerymobile channel
[08:37:23] <wendallsan> yay thanks
[08:37:50] <faraway> does anyone know a good hotkey plugin for jquery that works with 1.7
[08:38:26] <b0bi> is it okay to have a div between li's in a ul
[08:38:27] <b0bi> ?
[08:38:37] <shoky> b0bi: not really
[08:39:29] <b0bi> shoky: how would you suggest to add additional information on a specific li? like when clicking it to make it expand.
[08:39:36] <shoky> (not saying it woulnd't work.. but its not "okay")
[08:39:41] * hlveheart slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[08:39:49] <shoky> yo evlh
[08:39:53] <hlveheart> sup sir
[08:40:17] <shoky> b0bi: you can add stuff in an li, or you can add another li..
[08:40:27] <masak> Jon47: then I instead wonder if there's a new -- better -- way to distinguish "this input was blurred by <Tab> being pressed" from all other kinds of .blur
[08:40:45] <shoky> evlh not much. u
[08:43:17] <Jon47> masak: you can check the keyCode of the action that spawned the event I believe, with e.which
[08:46:35] <masak> Jon47: ah, yes. would you say that's a good idea? am I likely to get bitten by something there as well?
[08:47:05] <Jon47> masak nothin comes to mind, but you'd do well to test all the scenarios by which you might blur the object in every browser you care about
[08:47:40] <faraway> masak: take care with key event, i'm currently messing around with them (http://javascript.info/tutorial/keyboard-events)
[08:48:26] <masak> faraway: thanks.
[08:50:29] <jonathancutrell> So here's a community question -
[08:50:29] <masak> seems I should check for keyCode=9 and char='' (the latter to avoid trapping Shift+Tab etc)
[08:50:46] <jonathancutrell> Where would I go to find a good index of "plugins that people need but don't exist yet" ?
[08:57:55] <lathan> masak: blur fires whenever your focus leaves the field. if you are in focus and you leave the window... you lose focus...if you do anything that moves your focus on your computer, than you have lost focus on that field
[08:58:26] <lathan> masak, sorry, I was behind in the chat history
[09:01:45] <masak> lathan: still bears repeating :)
[09:01:51] <faraway> jonathancutrell: i don't know a list, i more often had the situation that there was/where a plugin(s), but that it/they was/were  bad one, then not finding one for my purpose
[09:02:19] <lathan> masak, I got the feel of that when I made the mistake of putting an alert on a blur event
[09:02:29] <masak> :P
[09:02:32] <lathan> masak, because everytime you alert it blurs away from the field....and makes another alert
[09:02:38] <masak> alert is pain.
[09:02:58] <masak> I ended up trapping keyPress events, and then doing event.preventDefault() on all cases of <Tab>, setting my own focus. it works like a charm.
[09:03:07] <masak> er, .keypress events
[09:06:17] <faraway> masak: you should check if this works in opera (if you want to support it) they are/where a little bit strict in which key events can be prevented (especially with standard user interaction key combinations)
[09:07:49] <t432> what is the name of the function to send (param) data  when calling a function that take multiple multiple params?
[09:08:16] <EnginA> docs say .live is being deprecated and .on must be used instead but they don't offer same functionailty
[09:08:25] <EnginA> live works fine with future objects and on dose not
[09:08:54] <clocKwize> how do i append inside something (e.g. not after, but after the last thing inside it)
[09:09:07] <t432> EnginAL was that for me?
[09:09:21] <t432> EnginA:
[09:11:08] <lathan> t432, are you talking about a function call, or an ajax call?
[09:11:22] <lathan> EnginA, .on(event,selector,function) works like delegate did
[09:11:40] <t432> ajax call, think i got it
[09:11:47] <t432> data()
[09:12:21] <EnginA> lathan: that is not a replacement for .live's future featuer. as in, it applies to the elements added afterwards
[09:12:29] <lathan> $.ajax({ url: 'url',data: $('form').serialize() });
[09:12:38] <lathan> EnginA, I know what I am talking about. on does both
[09:12:46] <t432> lathan: curious. whats the difference between the 2?
[09:12:53] <EnginA> lathan: just tried, it didn't.
[09:12:57] <lathan> EnginA, http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:13:05] <EnginA> let me check again
[09:13:27] <lathan> t432, between which two?
[09:13:35] <johnathanb> I have an object, some html, that I want to turn into a string of html. How do I do this?
[09:13:37] <EnginA> ok, minor, misusage :)
[09:13:44] <lathan> t432, no.... .data() is a way to store data attached to an element
[09:13:48] <masak> faraway: oh, thanks. I'll check.
[09:13:50] <johnathanb> The object never appears on the page so I don't do whatever.html()
[09:14:02] <lathan> t432 .serialize() takes a form or group of form elements and turns it into the name=value pairs
[09:14:16] <t432> lathan: ah
[09:14:18] <lathan> johnathanb, which is it. an object or html?
[09:14:37] <johnathanb> $( '<p>Hello</p>' )
[09:14:40] <lathan> EnginA, yah...I need to spend a couple of hours and just do everything with on....don't have it downpat
[09:14:42] <johnathanb> An object of html..?
[09:14:55] <lathan> johnathanb, $('<p>Hello</p>').appendTo('#div')
[09:15:07] <johnathanb> I don't want that.
[09:15:39] <lathan> johnathanb, you want it in the html?
[09:16:44] <johnathanb> No. I just want the HTML as a string
[09:17:38] <Anime> if i already have a <div> tag with a click event bound, if i set another bind does it overwrite the previous one?
[09:17:50] <Anime> another click bind, that is
[09:19:14] <lathan> johnathanb, you mean you want this: $('#div').html()
[09:20:49] <johnathanb> No.
[09:21:01] <johnathanb> my_html = $( '<p>Hello</p>' )
[09:21:07] <t432> anyone familiar with spring-mvc framework?
[09:21:23] <t432> my q is slightly related
[09:21:34] <johnathanb> That never appears on the page, I want to turn $( '<p>Hello</p>' ) into text, instead of the object.
[09:21:40] <johnathanb> lathan ^^
[09:22:29] <t432> would this work? http://pastebin.com/3ATD6u1t
[09:23:04] <lathan> johnathanb, $('<p>Hello</p>').html() or .text()
[09:23:25] <Anime> is it wrong to bind click events to anything other than <a> <input> or <button>?
[09:23:38] <lathan> Anime, not wrong at all
[09:27:52] <johnathanb> lathan I need the parent as well.
[09:28:24] <lathan> johnathanb, where is this coming from? your question doesn't make sense
[09:28:36] <lathan> johnathanb, or are you being given an object with it already?
[09:28:48] <johnathanb> my_html = $( '<p>Hello</p>' ), I need to turn that into "<p>Hello</p>"
[09:28:52] <lathan> johnathanb, $object_with_html.wrap('span').html()
[09:29:15] <lathan> basically just .wrap('span').html()
[09:29:38] <lathan> johnathanb, that just puts a parent around it, then you pull the html from the parent which gives you all of the inside element
[09:29:53] <johnathanb> That's not doing it
[09:29:54] <johnathanb> http://jsfiddle.net/NKUMn/
[09:30:17] <Anime> lathan, a friend teaching me web stuff swears that i should never do that because of "compatibility"
[09:31:18] <lathan> johnathanb, here...try this: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/NKUMn/1/
[09:32:29] <lathan> Anime, well, I'm afraid that there is a line between teaching theory and actuall practice. I can see where there could be a twitch at binding a click to a div or something. but divs and other elements can get native click elements. all the browsers do it, its not something wierd jQuery is imposing on the browsers
[09:33:16] <Anime> oh. understood, thanks!
[09:33:46] <lathan> Anime, I hate to talk bad about someone I don't now...but that seems a bit fishy
[09:34:01] <lathan> never heard that in my life. if someone I knew told me that I'd laugh in their face
[09:34:07] <lathan> almost
[09:35:20] <Anime> i never heard that too, even tried to find sources about it but left out empty handed
[09:36:41] <lathan> Anime, I don't suppose that person is a jokester?
[09:36:47] <Anime> i assure you he's not
[09:36:53] <lathan> hm
[09:36:55] <lathan> idk
[09:37:06] <Anime> just picky beyond limits
[09:37:09] <faraway> Anime: probably he heared once that you shouldn't do javascript only navigation cause search engines don't parse javascript. and he didn't understand it :D
[09:37:11] <lathan> I know some of those
[09:37:44] <lathan> faraway, of course you can do that...as long as you do have the href attr assigned
[09:37:50] <lathan> bye people.....its been fun
[09:38:00] <faraway> lathan: that why is said js only
[09:38:14] <Anime> :/
[09:38:26] <faraway> Anime:  for accessability it was true
[09:39:39] <faraway> Anime: but nowadays you can add special tags to elements to that they are also recognized as being clickable
[09:40:09] <Anime> ah..
[09:41:04] <faraway> Anime: so if you ant to be a nice person and want to support handicapped people you need to take care about this ;)
[09:41:13] <jonathancutrell> Is anyone in here competing in #gcj ?
[09:51:01] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/7kFVm/1/ what's up with the multiple search ?
[09:52:32] <dogarrhea2> jsfiddle bug or jqueryui bug?
[09:52:58] <hlveheart> dogarrhea2, one sec looking
[09:54:22] <hlveheart> well, just a heads up that you're calling jquery jquery ui, and jquery mobile twice
[09:54:54] <dogarrhea2> ok
[09:55:12] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/7kFVm/6/
[09:55:13] <hlveheart> fixed
[09:55:13] <hlveheart> lol
[09:57:11] <jedimind> ugh jquery mobile
[10:01:06] <dogarrhea2> just evaluating jquery mobile to see if it's worthwhile
[10:01:23] <hlveheart> it sure is. I love it.
[10:01:55] <dogarrhea2> can it do vibration/accelerometer/other hardware stuff?
[10:02:18] <dogarrhea2> sound is one area where I am particularly picky about, having evaluated 3 frameworks for this already
[10:03:04] <hlveheart> not sure
[10:03:04] <hlveheart> :/
[10:06:49] <dogarrhea2> there are definitely bugs in the android os/browser when it comes to sound.
[10:07:06] <dogarrhea2> ie, you cannot tell if a sound is finished playing in android because the finish event is broken
[10:18:16] <lmao25> does anyone know the anaswer to this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11692464/jquery-cant-get-submit-to-work
[10:19:45] <warrenparsons> lmao25: It was already answered on that page.
[10:20:00] <wookiehangover> lmao25: you're trigger the event you've bound to
[10:20:15] <wookiehangover> what you need to do is set your return state in a var
[10:20:18] <wookiehangover> and then return it
[10:20:26] <wookiehangover> and *not* preventDefault()
[10:20:34] <wookiehangover> eg, var status = false;
[10:20:48] <wookiehangover> if( whatever === true ) status = true;
[10:20:51] <wookiehangover> return status;
[10:21:11] <wookiehangover> (if you want it to do a full html form submit at the end)
[10:21:14] <wookiehangover> just return true
[10:21:25] <warrenparsons> lmao25: Also don't assault the user with multiple alert()s. Cripes.
[10:22:15] <ajpiano> lmao25: i think doing this.submit()
[10:22:18] <ajpiano> will trigger the native handlers
[10:22:20] <ajpiano> and not the jquery ones
[10:22:27] <ajpiano> i think that's essentialyl what you want to do
[10:23:06] <ajpiano> by native handler, i mean, it'll just submit the form then
[10:34:26] <totimkopf> hai
[10:35:22] <totimkopf> I have radio buttons inside divs and when the divs are clicked I want the radio buttons to be selected, any ideas how I would do this please? :)
[10:38:43] <warrenparsons> totimkopf: That's an HTML question rather than a jQuery question. In any case, wrap your radio buttons with label tags and style those. The entire label area will be clickable.
[10:39:27] <totimkopf> warrenparsons, thanks :)
[10:41:25] <rhino__> I'm trying to get the id of a parent div when its child select element is changed.  will this not work:  alert(this.parent().id);
[10:41:58] <warrenparsons> rhino__: Try $(this).parent().attr('id');
[10:43:53] <rhino__> warrenparsons:  when I alert the value, it alerts as undefined.  Any ideas?
[10:44:15] <warrenparsons> rhino__: Can you put it in a jsfiddle?
[10:44:21] <rhino__> yup
[10:46:44] <enrique> Hi, I am looking for a method to get the closest down element like $(myElement ~ nextElement). Example: myElement.closestNext('nextElement').
[10:50:07] <warrenparsons> enrique: $('.myElement').find('.nextElement').first() probably does what you want.

[10:58:20] <maslo> hi guys I'd really appreciate it if any of you could help me out with an .animate on my dropdown menu, you can see the menu at http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/ (if you hover services) the js is at http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/wp-content/themes/aem/js/function.js
[10:59:50] <dzajdband> maslo: The script IE8.js throws an exception on chrome
[11:01:47] <maslo> dzajdband: I'll look into that thank you
[11:08:04] <maslo> dzajdband: any luck on the .animate for the dropdown? ;x
[11:09:02] <dzajdband> maslo: You still have the issue with the script
[11:11:48] <maslo> dzajdband: I know....I'm thinking about just removing that script, I'll have to ask the person who added it though because it's more than 1 person working on it, it's not really causing any issues though so I'll leave it until then
[11:14:57] <FernandoBasso> I have a $.post request that returns <script>location='../../pAdmin'</script> as part or the response.
[11:15:12] <FernandoBasso> Nowhere in the code am I telling it to return something like that...
[11:15:55] <FernandoBasso> For example, it should return an email which was sent with that post, but it returns the email && that strange line: <script>location='../../pAdmin'</script>fernando@gmail.com
[11:15:56] <codacoder> hey guys
[11:16:09] <webe> Can some one please help me? Why do I need to use an $('selector').each() v.s. $('selector')?
[11:16:48] <codacoder> does anyone know if .off() has issues in 1.7.2?
[11:17:57] <vbn> each() is for a user-defined function, the other way supports only the methods defined in the jquery API
[11:18:58] <vbn> like, to set css use the 2nd, to alert your last name use the 1st
[11:19:30] <vbn> webe: ^
[11:19:47] <NoiseEee> codacoder: maybe write up a jsfiddle showing your issue?
[11:21:05] <webe> ok
[11:21:13] <webe> I think that helps
[11:37:56] <codacoder> u there NoiseEee?
[11:38:05] <codacoder> sorry - got a phone call
[11:39:35] <codacoder> $(".pass-button, .fail-button, .info-button") .off("click") .on("click", function() { doStuff(this);  });
[11:40:14] <codacoder> that off is NOT having the effect it should - previous run through is still assigned
[11:40:49] <codacoder> 1.7.1 did not have this problem
[11:41:40] <codacoder> anyone?
[11:42:07] <maslo> could anyone help me out with an .animate(), I've been trying stuff around but I can't seem to get it to look nice, http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/, and the js dropdown+animate is at http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/wp-content/themes/aem/js/function.js
[11:54:21] <maslo> is there any visibility/display in jquery .animate?
[11:57:21] <vbn> maslo: here it claims to support css properties, so visibility or display shoudl work:    http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:00:35] <vbn> codacoder: here it works in 1.7.2    http://jsfiddle.net/XdDuQ/
[12:03:46] <vbn> maslo: can't get the problem, the 'services' menu gets animated on chrome
[12:04:01] <NoiseEee> codacoder: specifically http://jsfiddle.net/XdDuQ/1/
[12:09:17] <codacoder> thanks guys.  I edited the first one to cover the circs better (hope it saved, ok).  And yes, it works.  Must be something else in my code reassigning after the .off() call
[12:12:41] <fakingfantastic> hey guys, I'm doing an ajax call to load css/html into a page. How can I wait for the CSS to load before I attempt to show the content, to avoid a FOUC
[12:15:09] <ktstowell> What jQuery ajax wrapper are you using? ($,ajax, $.load, etc)
[12:15:19] <ktstowell> $.ajax*
[12:18:53] <vbn_> fakingfantastic: you add the html/css to the page inside the ajax success function?
[12:20:55] <ktstowell> That is the most common way of doing it.
[12:21:15] <fakingfantastic> that waits for the assets to load?
[12:21:31] <fakingfantastic> So, once success runs, we can be assured that the CSS is ready to run?
[12:21:47] <ktstowell> It assumes your working with return data.
[12:22:12] <ktstowell> So, yes, it would already be 'loaded'
[12:22:16] <fakingfantastic> thx
[12:22:39] <ktstowell> i.e success: function(data) { // data would be whatever your server-side method is returning}
[12:23:00] <vbn_> ajax just downloads content, one adds the css with some other method, which could be after a sync ajax
[12:23:26] <vbn_> but it's true that it's the most common way
[12:23:26] <ktstowell> Correct
[12:26:11] <vbn_> what method you use to inject the css?
[12:26:56] <Blaker0111> Hi. I am using the autocomplete() plugin in jQuery UI. If you click in the field and press the down arrow key on your keyboard it shows a list of all possible autocomplete options. Is there a way I can have this same pop-out show when I click the field? I tried to bind a click event and have it trigger "autocompleteopen" however its not working. Any ideas?
[12:28:18] <Blaker0111> This is the plugin/widget I am referencing: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple
[12:29:04] <denom> Is it possible to apply selector based cascading style sheet rules with jquery? Something like "div img { max-width: none; }" where the div is a specific element?
[12:29:51] <denom> Blaker0111, can you make a jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:30:16] <pyF-AM> I think that would be $('#divId img').css()
[12:30:56] <ktstowell> Yes you could do $('div img').css('max-diwth', 'none');
[12:31:02] <ktstowell> width*
[12:31:33] <denom> ktstowell, will this rule cascade if new img's are appended to the div?
[12:31:44] <denom> guess I can try it too :)
[12:31:51] <pyF-AM> you'd have to execute that JS again for new elements
[12:31:55] <ktstowell> depends on when the above is run :)
[12:32:01] <ktstowell> ^
[12:32:25] <ktstowell> Is there a reason you can't just make a rule for that in a css file?
[12:32:59] <pyF-AM> actually you could
[12:33:06] <ktstowell> I mean
[12:33:11] <ktstowell> Is there a reason he isn't
[12:33:19] <pyF-AM> oh, right =)
[12:33:20] <denom> ktstowell, good point. I'm writing an abstract form field that pops up a google map. However some css rules in twitter bootstrap are mangling the google maps controls
[12:33:55] <ktstowell> I see
[12:33:56] <vbn_> otherwise you could $.add('<style></style>')
[12:33:57] <denom> Since twitter bootstrap is such a big deal, I thought I would make a special exception in my code
[12:34:10] <vbn_> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[12:34:59] <ktstowell> When I need to have truly dynamic sections, i usually make an object method to re-execute code when the DOM is updated. Or, yea, $.add.
[12:38:25] <denom> ktstowell, it sound like for dynamic DOM sub trees that the only way to keep the styles "fresh" (without intervention) is to append a style tag with the rules you need?
[12:39:18] <ktstowell> Yeah, i.e if you look at the $.add example a little ways down the page
[12:39:20] <dogarrhea2> hrm. so the question is to how to play sound in a mobile browser without: flash, native applications, or html5
[12:40:04] <ktstowell> $('li').add('div img').css('max-width', 'none');
[12:41:12] <denom> dogarrhea2,  object tag ?
[12:41:37] <MistuhKurtz> dogarrhea2, use the soundmanager2 library
[12:41:44] <dogarrhea2> tried that.
[12:41:58] <MistuhKurtz> and it didn't work on what platform?
[12:42:00] <dogarrhea2> doesn't work. visit their page via android (the demo page) and you will see that sound does not play
[12:42:07] <dogarrhea2> on my s2 default browser/os
[12:42:13] <MistuhKurtz> wtf
[12:42:26] <MistuhKurtz> does audio on soundcloud.com play?
[12:42:53] <dogarrhea2> it was one of them
[12:43:01] <dogarrhea2> and there is the additional bug of not playing a sound more than once
[12:43:11] <MistuhKurtz> it was one of them? what?
[12:43:24] <dogarrhea2> MistuhKurtz: i'll replicate later in the day when i have time
[12:43:27] <dogarrhea2> but i remember running into this a few months ago
[12:43:38] <dogarrhea2> which is why i'm asking about "without flash or html5"
[12:43:39] <MistuhKurtz> Well I was asking, does the audio on soundcloud.com work in your phone?
[12:44:13] <dogarrhea2> send link plz
[12:44:19] <MistuhKurtz> ...
[12:44:22] <MistuhKurtz> http://soundcloud.com
[12:45:33] <dogarrhea2> plays there
[12:45:47] <dogarrhea2> that's a usecase that i can handle fine. click button. play sound
[12:45:58] <dogarrhea2> but serially playing a sound upon completion of another is broken
[12:46:03] <dogarrhea2> and 2.3 doesn't work.
[12:46:59] <MistuhKurtz> Okay well I guess I can't help you then, good luck
[12:47:02] <MistuhKurtz> soundcloud.com uses soundmanager2
[12:50:23] <dogarrhea2> there are some other edge cases with soundmanger as well. very "short" sounds (mp3 files representing noise of less than 1 second)
[12:50:32] <lotus> hey, so I know this comes up alot.  jQuery executes code asynchronously (not just ajax calls) and that is causing one bit of code to execute before the code it depends on is finished.  I'm using jquery ui "tabs" and I want to get css properties from the rendered tabs.  I haven't had any success using the builtin callbacks for the Tabs object.  Any advice on how I can get this to work?  I'ma build a jsfiddle
[12:50:33] <dogarrhea2> they are cut off/slow to play etc
[12:50:44] <dogarrhea2> i'll look at object
[12:53:56] <lotus> http://jsfiddle.net/9gBmz/
[12:54:35] <NoiseEee> lotus: s/jQuery executes code asynchronously/javascript executes code asynchronously
[12:54:36] <lotus> I'm not even sure what I'm trying to do at this opint... oops
[12:55:01] <lotus> NoiseEee, oh, thankyou.  I thought you needed "worker threads" to get that functionality natively in javascript
[12:55:08] <dogarrhea2> hmm. I guess there is a need to try one more sound framework..

[12:57:07] <sunbeam> I'd like to be able to submit a form when a certain anchor $(".submit") is clicked
[12:57:17] <sunbeam> eh no sorry
[12:57:18] <sunbeam> i mean
[12:57:39] <sunbeam> I want to completely disable a form from submitting, but when the submit button is clicked, i want it to .click another anchor
[12:57:47] <sunbeam> Any idea how I can do this best?
[12:57:53] <lotus> oh, figured it out.  Okay so at the bottom of document.ready, I'm trying to see what the margins are of the tab box, but I need the script which adjusts the margins to finish executing.  Is the only way to do this by entering into a loop and checking for a flag to be set before continuing?
[12:58:08] <SirCmpwn> sunbeam: disable submitting $("form selector").submit(function () { return false; });
[12:58:16] <SirCmpwn> or, e.preventDefault();
[12:58:34] <SirCmpwn> you can also use $("some other selector").click();
[12:59:06] <NoiseEee> why .click another anchor sunbeam?
[12:59:33] <ktstowell1> lotus:  that's a common way of managing race conditions.
[12:59:34] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: just disable the button on submission of the form so it can't be submitted again
[13:00:19] <lotus> ktstowell1, nothing built into jquery though?  like... queue this function after this other one?
[13:01:25] <ktstowell1> jQuery is pretty stellar at building callbacks into their own functions, not familiar is .tabs() has the functionality you need built in hower, i'd go to their API page and see what exposed methods they have.
[13:01:51] <lotus> ktstowell1, yeah I've been playing with their callbacks... maybe I just need to re-think my logic.
[13:01:52] <ktstowell1> Tbh, jqUI is a bit too rigid for me, I usually end up homerolling my own UI components.
[13:02:49] <ktstowell1> ie. is you don't have an <h3> inside of a <div> your dialog won't have a header, etc.
[13:02:54] <ktstowell1> gah, if*
[13:03:33] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: because it should slide
[13:03:42] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: i like to click the anchor thats responsible for the slide
[13:03:55] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: i will submit it manually
[13:04:02] <NoiseEee> alright, go for it
[13:04:18] <NoiseEee> i geuss you'll have to track whether the form has been submitted or not... if so, do your thang
[13:07:03] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: i already disabled "enter" in this form focussed
[13:07:07] <sunbeam> now when the submit button is clicked
[13:07:10] <sunbeam> it should not submit the form
[13:07:20] <sunbeam> but it should .click some a.next button
[13:07:30] <sunbeam> (and in between check the last values of the last slide)
[13:08:08] <NoiseEee> go for it
[13:08:15] <lotus> sunbeam, $('myFormSelector').on('submit',function(event){ e.preventDefault(); $('myAnchorSelector').click()});
[13:08:34] <ktstowell1> sunbeam: $('#your-submit-button').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('#your-anchor-elem').click()});
[13:08:36] <lotus> like SirCmpwn said earlier
[13:08:38] <ktstowell1> yep, lol
[13:08:47] <sunbeam> haha
[13:08:50] <sunbeam> ok thanks guys ill try this
[13:09:08] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: feel free to try things yourself too
[13:09:24] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: i mean, you've been in here long enough.  its time you tried first, and then showed up here with a jsfiddle of your problems
[13:09:30] <ktstowell1> just make sure your passing in the same word as your referencing, ie. event vs. e
[13:09:33] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: the spoonfeeding gets a little much
[13:09:53] <ktstowell1> you're
[13:10:14] * ktstowell1 correcting myself, sorry
[13:11:06] <lotus> NoiseEee, These are complicated problems!  We're gurus and we solve with magix~

[13:17:45] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[13:18:16] <Toerkeium> do you know of any feature to work with a listview with jquery?
[13:55:46] <eip56> ladies and germs
[13:58:58] <[fields]_> I have a text input with an id of "myInput"  which could contain 0 or more single quotes, which I need to escape.  How do you achieve this?
[13:59:40] <eip56> By excape do you mean there are "" around the qoute
[13:59:51] <[fields]_> no, all ' should become \'
[14:00:16] <[fields]_> so I can insert it in to local sqli db
[14:01:59] <eip56> umm are you using php
[14:02:03] <eip56> to insert
[14:02:06] <[fields]_> nope
[14:02:15] <[fields]_> this is a phonegap mobile app
[14:02:25] <[fields]_> has sqlite3 as a db
[14:02:45] <eip56> maybe run a regex... probably a simplier way tho but that is the most surefire
[14:03:09] <[fields]_> alright, I could really use some help here on perfect syntax
[14:03:23] <[fields]_> currently it seems like my best route is with javascript (not jQuery) approach
[14:03:56] <[fields]_> something to the extent of:  document.getElementById('myInput').replace(/'/g, \\');
[14:04:32] <[fields]_> I haven't tested that.  It could be what I need.  But something seems off about the syntax
[14:04:39] <shoky> replace(/'/g, "'")
[14:05:06] <[fields]_> shoky:  I would think that is no change.
[14:05:13] <[fields]_> shoky:  that would replace every ' to '
[14:05:24] <shoky> er i meant "\\'" yeah ;)
[14:05:33] <[fields]_> awesome.  thank you.
[14:05:34] <shoky> the quotes is the important bit
[14:05:39] <codacoder> string.replace(/\'/g,"\\'")
[14:06:12] <[fields]_> codacoder:  why /\'/g   ?   I don't see the point in escaping at the start
[14:06:18] <shoky> either is fine
[14:06:27] <[fields]_> \' won't be found
[14:06:32] <codacoder> then dont
[14:06:40] <[fields]_> thank you.
[14:06:44] <[fields]_> very much.
[14:06:45] <shoky> ?js "he'he''hehe".replace(/\'/g,"\\'")
[14:06:51] <bot-t> shoky: "he\'he\'\'hehe"
[14:06:52] <codacoder> works here - things would break if it didnt
[14:07:09] <[fields]_> clever
[14:08:42] <eip56> good place to test regex
[14:08:43] <eip56> http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[14:09:29] <shoky> flash? nah
[14:09:42] <shoky> just go to your console
[14:10:10] <hoolter> Anyone have IE9+ installed that could help me test a quick line in their console? =)
[14:10:23] <shoky> hoolter: ye
[14:10:43] <bobbytek> Anyone know of a simple way of generating n visually distinct colors for the purpose of a series color palette?
[14:11:27] <hoolter> shoky: shweet! what version u got?
[14:11:40] <shoky> hoolter: 9
[14:12:12] <hoolter> oh cool.
[14:12:19] <eip56> <has 9 as well
[14:12:22] <hoolter> what does !-[1,] return?
[14:12:41] <shoky> true
[14:13:52] <NoiseEee> trailing commas, why???
[14:14:10] <hoolter> shoky: and !!-[1,] ?
[14:14:43] <shoky> false
[14:15:07] <shoky> can  you guess what !!!-[1,] gives?
[14:15:36] <hoolter> shoky: is that a trick question?
[14:15:39] <shoky> ;]
[14:15:40] <eip56> an elephant!
[14:15:46] <hoolter> a donkey?
[14:15:51] <eip56> lol
[14:15:51] <hoolter> a zebra?
[14:15:57] <hoolter> a zepto?
[14:16:07] <hoolter> shoky: i assume true?
[14:16:09] <eip56> kinda of an obscure way to define a true or false doesnt it
[14:16:16] <hoolter> but this *is* IE we're dealing with.
[14:16:16] <shoky> aye
[14:18:26] <hamcore> i have <h6>aaa<h6><span style="display:none;">bbb</span> <h6>bbb<h6><span style="display:none;">ccc</span>, i want to click on h6 and display its respective span, how should i do?
[14:18:41] <hamcore> tried $('h6').click(function() { $('h6').find('span').slideToggle(200); return false; });​ but it also displays the first span
[14:23:01] <andrewSC> hi all
[14:23:21] <andrewSC> i've been trying to append text to a div element using the .append function but my text isn't being written
[14:23:48] <andrewSC> i debugged the JS and it is getting text
[14:23:52] <andrewSC> i just isn't writing it
[14:23:55] <andrewSC> :/
[14:24:00] <NoiseEee> andrewSC: append is for adding dom elements.
[14:24:14] <andrewSC> NoiseEee: oh
[14:24:16] <hamcore> NoiseEee, could you help me?
[14:24:21] <hamcore> i have <h6>aaa<h6><span style="display:none;">bbb</span> <h6>bbb<h6><span style="display:none;">ccc</span>, i want to click on h6 and display its respective span, how should i do?
[14:24:22] <NoiseEee> perhaps you want $(yourDiv).html('lookit me now')
[14:24:23] <hamcore> tried $('h6').click(function() { $('h6').find('span').slideToggle(200); return false; });​ but it also displays the first span
[14:24:39] <andrewSC> NoiseEee: i tried that and i got the same result?
[14:24:49] <NoiseEee> andrewSC: jsfiddle it
[14:25:24] <andrewSC> NoiseEee: will do
[14:25:34] <NoiseEee> hamcore: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[14:26:03] <loincloth> world's best i18n plugin: GO!
[14:28:49] <dogarrhea2> bleh. jsfiddle errors make debugging difficult
[14:29:08] <codacoder> andrewSC: your selector is broken some kinda way
[14:29:13] <andrewSC> codacoder: i fixed it
[14:29:19] <andrewSC> it was xml results for ne
[14:29:21] <andrewSC> one*
[14:29:31] <andrewSC> and two i need to iterate over the resulting objects and get their contents
[14:29:56] <codacoder> good ol' childNodes - oh what fun
[14:30:03] <andrewSC> codacoder: oh you know it ;)
[14:30:27] <codacoder> ;)
[14:33:43] <codacoder> NoiseEee: FYI that jsFiddle we were mucking about with earlier re .off() problems... way too trivial an example.  Doesn't capture the real essence of the problem
[14:34:04] <shoky> bobbytek: http://jsfiddle.net/uVVG4/ :P
[14:34:07] <codacoder> Still convinced that there's an issue with off()
[14:35:05] <bobbytek> shoky, awesome! thanks!
[14:35:34] <codacoder> NoiseEee: reason I was using a bunch of class selectors was to keep the code generic (shorter than maintaining ids)
[14:36:44] <codacoder> NoiseeEee: the buttons are added dynamically - first time there are three like the fiddle shows... next time there are 6... 9... 12... etc
[14:38:01] <codacoder> so doing .off("click") should remove all click handlers for matched classes - doesn't second and subsequent times through (note first time it's removing stuff that doesnt exist but that shouldnt matter)
[14:38:04] <TorpedoSkyline> How come calling the jQuery() object in the Chrome Dev Console doesn't show me an object I can look at? All it says is []
[14:39:26] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline:  var z = $();
[14:39:32] <shoky> then you can check out z
[14:39:38] <shoky> with auto-completion goodness
[14:40:04] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, all I'm getting is []. =\
[14:40:22] <TorpedoSkyline> even when I go var z = $(); and then type z
[14:40:40] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline: yeah, i meant then if you just type  'z.'  without enter
[14:40:54] <shoky> it'll show you all of z's fields
[14:41:02] <shoky> also try: dir($())
[14:41:13] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, so what if I want to just examine everything in the DOM?
[14:41:15] <shoky> then you can look at the object (and its prototype chain)
[14:41:45] <shoky> everything in the DOM?
[14:41:49] <shoky> then you'd go to elements tab..
[14:42:26] <shoky> anyway, did 'dir' help?
[14:42:59] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, ok so I'm doing a screencast and he's showing me how to use the $. So he's typing $("#slider-bar") and it's showing him a drop down with all sorts of info.
[14:43:11] <TorpedoSkyline> But when I do it on the same page with the same DOM nodes, I get nothing.
[14:43:15] <bakers> How do I test if an an object is has SOME property
[14:43:23] <bakers> I want to know if an object is not {}
[14:43:36] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline: donno what he's doing, but if you do:  var z = $('#slider-bar');
[14:43:48] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline: then type z and dot:  z.  you'll get the drop-down
[14:44:11] <bobbytek> shoky, is hue2rgb portable?
[14:44:20] <TorpedoSkyline> SyntaxError: Unexpected token. }
[14:44:48] <shoky> bobbytek: whatcha mean?
[14:45:21] <shoky> bobbytek: you can move it outside if you want, yea
[14:45:27] <bobbytek> shoky, is it crossbrowser?
[14:45:35] <shoky> oh
[14:45:45] <shoky> just that inner hue2rgb function?
[14:45:52] <bobbytek> oops!
[14:45:59] <bobbytek> didn't notice that was an inner function
[14:45:59] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, still nothing.
[14:46:01] <bobbytek> Sorry!
[14:46:04] <bobbytek> :)
[14:46:04] <shoky> ah
[14:46:30] <shoky> well i made it output rgb(x,y,z)  format
[14:46:39] <shoky> i think that works cross-browser, not sure
[14:46:49] <shoky> it could easily be changed to hex tho
[14:46:59] <bobbytek> thanks, all is working well
[14:47:15] <bobbytek> just curious why you randomized the s and l?
[14:47:20] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline:  dir( $('#slider-bar') )
[14:47:46] <shoky> bobbytek: i didn't write the algorithm, just ported it :P
[14:47:55] <shoky> bobbytek: but, why not randomize them
[14:47:57] <bobbytek> ah, :)
[14:48:00] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky undefined.
[14:48:09] <bobbytek> because this should be deterministic for my needs
[14:48:13] <TorpedoSkyline> I must be doing something wrong… XD
[14:48:21] <shoky> the important one is h which should be uniformly uhh
[14:48:23] <shoky> i forget the word
[14:48:49] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline:  console.dir( $() )
[14:48:50] <shoky> ?
[14:49:16] <shoky> it's fine if the last line says undefined, that's just the return value from console.dir ..
[14:49:23] <shoky> look at the line before that
[14:49:47] <TorpedoSkyline> so I typed console.dir( $() )
[14:49:47] <shoky> should have 'Query.fn.jQuery.init[0]' or smth
[14:49:52] <TorpedoSkyline> and it says undefined.
[14:50:01] <shoky> and in the line above undefined ?
[14:50:11] <TorpedoSkyline> Nothing.
[14:50:22] <TorpedoSkyline> undefined is the last line and the line before is what I typed.
[14:50:33] <TorpedoSkyline> I'm using jQuery 1.7.2, but I doubt that makes a difference.
[14:50:35] <shoky> console.log( $ )  ?
[14:51:13] <TorpedoSkyline> function ( selector, context ) { //content here }
[14:51:20] <TorpedoSkyline> That's working.
[14:52:44] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, seems like I should be getting the drop down with all the info but I'm not… =\
[14:52:49] <shoky> donno, dir($()) shows me the 'jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[0]'  that i can expand..
[14:53:11] <vbn_> torpedo, could you link the page?
[14:53:26] <TorpedoSkyline> vbn_, it's local.
[14:53:31] <vbn_> d'oh.
[14:53:41] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, ok so that showed me all sorts of info.
[14:53:48] <TorpedoSkyline> what does dir() do?
[14:55:33] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline: shows the object tree
[14:55:51] <TorpedoSkyline> ok. Things must have changed since 2009, shoky. ;P
[14:56:58] <shoky> ;P
[15:01:28] <shoky> just learned about console.group()/groupEnd()
[15:01:31] <shoky> pretty nifty
[15:11:49] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, I figured out my issue.
[15:12:00] <TorpedoSkyline> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/ <-- Returning an empty set.
[15:13:00] <TorpedoSkyline> As of jQuery 1.4 (screencast uses 1.3.2) calling the jQuery() method returns an empty jQuery set. It used to return a set containing the document node.
[15:16:04] <shoky> yes why wouldn't it be empty
[15:16:16] <shoky> oh screencast is old
[15:20:09] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, yeah a bit.
[15:21:13] <imachuchu> while this is the irc channel for it, if anyone has access to the jquery-ui web documentation the demo->dialog->options->draggable documentation has a bug in it
[15:21:14] <tw2113> what is $....really?
[15:21:26] <imachuchu> "If set to true, the dialog will be draggable will be draggable by the titlebar."

[15:24:53] <rretzbach_> Hi, I have a slider which is updated every 500ms. When I use the mouse to drag the slider longer than 500ms its "value" method is called and the slider handle "escapes" my drag until I move my mouse again. Can I somehow "disable" the value method until I finished dropping the handle?
[15:25:17] <rretzbach_> I have a start and stop callback, I "only" need a way to disable a method temporarily
[15:34:47] <pepijndevos> Is it somehow possible to have a jquery ui sortable that accepts html5 file drops?
[15:35:22] <pepijndevos> Currently I append a li on drop, but what I would like is to have a ghost element that interacts witht he sortable whil the user is draging the file
[15:35:31] <pepijndevos> nd then insert it in the right position
[15:37:40] <ktstowell1> I haven't heard of that implementation yet but i'd be interested to see how it works out :)
[15:41:08] <ravster> Hello everyone
[15:41:55] <izual> Hi, I have an html5 video and 'd like to know if jquery provides any way to get the download speed of the video
[15:42:37] <ravster> I'm trying to populate a <div> with images received through ajax and JSON. How do I access the images? How do I refer to them?
[15:48:02] <MistuhKurtz> ravster, in the sucess callback
[15:50:30] <ravster> MistuhKurtz: I'm going to be changing the attr of an image in the success callback. The call will be .attr("src", **whatDoIPutHere?**); ?
[15:51:05] <ktstowell1> you put the location of your images :/
[15:52:11] <ravster> but the images would be passed through ajax, JSON format. I'm not sure how to refer to them.  Something like json.image1?
[15:52:12] <ktstowell1> whether they be in the file system of your app or remotely linkable.
[15:52:19] <Fiveways> I'm trying to grab a value from an element that has brackets in it's name, if I want to access it I can do so by $("#Saturday\\[open\\]").val() but when I'm trying to access it dynamically i'm having trouble (i think it's due to the brackets). Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/EbcCcPEM . Any thoughts? Maybe a regexp or something to replace the brackets?
[15:52:32] <MistuhKurtz> ravster, the success function receives 3 parametrers: success(data, status, jqXHR)
[15:52:51] <ktstowell1> since you can't send images over JSON, im geussing you're saying that you're sending teh href's to the images over jSON
[15:52:59] <MistuhKurtz> you'll want to parse through the returned JSON stored in "data", find the new image SRC and apply it
[15:53:13] <ktstowell1> so it would be data.whateveryou're returning form your server-side method
[15:53:29] <ravster> ktstowell1: oh, okay
[15:53:30] <ktstowell1> aye, in the success callback do console.log(data)
[15:53:53] <ktstowell1> that will tell you in teh console what you're return object looks like.
[15:54:48] <ravster> ktstowell1: sweet
[15:55:10] <ravster> ktstowell1, MistuhKurtz : thanks
[15:55:31] <ktstowell1> obvously you need to be passing teh return object to teh function so do: "success: function(data) {console.log(data)}"
[15:57:17] <ravster> is there a way to iterate over the keys in a json? I wouldn't know how many pairs will be in there.
[15:57:35] <MistuhKurtz> ?each
[15:57:35] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:58:11] <acidjazz> i got an interesting ? .. i run into this alot
[15:58:20] <ktstowell1> $.each(data, function(key, value) {})
[15:58:30] <acidjazz> so i have a click handler bound to $('.jquery').click(myfunction);
[15:58:33] <ravster> oh, wow.
[15:58:52] <ktstowell1> then inside that you can do console.log(key, val)
[15:58:53] <acidjazz> so im in myyfunction() { } .. whats hte best way to find a child class inside of this element?
[15:59:00] <ravster> cool. I was thinking it would be something weird like data.each(....
[15:59:05] <ravster> nice
[15:59:12] <ktstowell1> only if you're calling it on a selector
[15:59:32] <ktstowell1> w/ objects you only init it w/ the $ object
[15:59:37] <acidjazz> like outside i could $('.jquery .myclass')... but i cant like.. $(this + ' .myclass').dostuff(); can i?
[16:00:22] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, you're not trying to use a context selector are you?
[16:00:45] <acidjazz> im in a function that is bound to a click handler and i want to find a child class inside that function MistuhKurtz
[16:01:08] <MistuhKurtz> oh
[16:01:14] <acidjazz> and im just curious whats the most efficient way
[16:01:18] <MistuhKurtz> $('.myClass', this).doStuff();
[16:01:21] <MistuhKurtz> OR
[16:01:21] <acidjazz> oooo
[16:01:25] <acidjazz> OOoooo
[16:01:26] <ktstowell1> use .is
[16:01:30] <MistuhKurtz> $(this).find('.myClass')
[16:01:33] <acidjazz> no i like the 1st
[16:01:33] <MistuhKurtz> either one
[16:01:37] <Dreamer3> anyone using web notations in safari 6?
[16:01:52] <MistuhKurtz> the first one calls the find() method
[16:01:58] <acidjazz> oh does it
[16:01:59] <FernandoBasso> I have jQuery.loadScript calling a script that has something like $('#tb' + tb_num + '1'), but tb_num comes as plain text, and so do the + signs. Any ideas?
[16:02:01] <MistuhKurtz> so they're the same, just choose whatevers more readable to you
[16:02:01] <acidjazz> thats just a shortcut i guess
[16:02:10] <FernandoBasso> tb_num comes from the 'main' script.
[16:02:17] <MistuhKurtz> the first one is known as a "context selector" acidjazz
[16:03:54] <acidjazz>     console.log($('.zoomicon', this).attr('class'));
[16:03:56] <acidjazz> undefined..
[16:04:02] <acidjazz> oh its not IN the element
[16:04:11] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: how about if its an element right below and i just want the 1st one?
[16:04:38] <MistuhKurtz> ?traversing @acidjazz
[16:04:39] <bot-t> acidjazz, Docs: Traversing - http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[16:05:30] <acidjazz> tnx
[16:05:47] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, what do you mean by "right below"
[16:05:49] <acidjazz> is there like a cheatsheet of everything you can do in $()
[16:05:55] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: n/m i figured it out
[16:06:08] <MistuhKurtz> $('.myClass:first', this);
[16:06:15] <MistuhKurtz> there's also :first-child
[16:06:19] <acidjazz> but that is if myClass is INSIDE this
[16:06:25] <denom> In jquery keydown events is there ever a case where the event's `ctrlKey` attr is always false?
[16:06:26] <MistuhKurtz> make sure you understand the difference between :first and :first-child
[16:06:32] <acidjazz> oh
[16:06:33] <acidjazz> i see
[16:06:37] <acidjazz> gotcha
[16:06:52] <denom> I can;t seem to get a value other than false in chrome
[16:07:35] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, not exactly sure what you're trying to select
[16:08:04] <denom> though the `which` attr is always 17...really strange
[16:08:54] <MistuhKurtz> which is the jquery-normalized property for identifying which key was pressed de
[16:08:56] <MistuhKurtz> den
[16:08:58] <MistuhKurtz> denom,
[16:10:23] <ArtificialEX> can I use content from div #id's in random places on a page, to submit as data on a json post?
[16:10:55] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, this look good: http://oscarotero.com/jquery/
[16:10:59] <denom> MistuhKurtz, isn't  ctrlKey also normalized?
[16:11:33] <ktstowell1> yes, ArtificialEX;
[16:13:33] <denom> well, I'm just testing if `ev.which == 17` seems to work ok..
[16:16:11] <MistuhKurtz> denom, could you post code?
[16:16:18] <MistuhKurtz> what are you binding the keydown event to?
[16:16:38] <MistuhKurtz> I've been reading and it looks like event.ctrlKey should work fine
[16:17:06] <ArtificialEX> thanks ktstowell1
[16:17:17] <ktstowell1> Word.
[16:17:42] <FernandoBasso> Is it possible to pass a variable from the main script to a script called with getScript?
[16:18:38] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: ooo even a pdf link
[16:19:00] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, also: http://woorkup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/jQuery-17-Visual-Cheat-Sheet1.pdf
[16:19:19] <MistuhKurtz> FernandoBasso, I believe so.
[16:19:39] <MistuhKurtz> ?tias @ FernandoBasso
[16:19:39] <bot-t> FernandoBasso, Try It And See
[16:19:57] <FernandoBasso> What?
[16:20:09] <MistuhKurtz> listen to the bot
[16:20:13] <MistuhKurtz> ;)
[16:22:05] <denom> MistuhKurtz, can't reproduce it in a jsfiddle, I'm not sure what is going on
[16:22:16] <acidjazz> that ones too big
[16:22:47] <pepijndevos> How can I make dragenter and dragleave only trigger on the root element?
[16:23:00] <MistuhKurtz> denom, well that's a start. Keep on debuggin ;)
[16:23:17] <MistuhKurtz> pepijndevos, event.stopPropagation(); might help
[16:23:23] <denom> The `ctrlKey` attr is always false in chrome though...firefox works as expected
[16:23:55] <MistuhKurtz> denom, if you can't isolate and reproduce the bug then it's not chrome that's at fault
[16:25:22] <pepijndevos> MistuhKurtz, well, it does not. It stil triggers when I drag over a child
[16:26:07] <MistuhKurtz> I'm sorry pepijndevos I don't quite understand your exact scenario...if you can isolate the problem on a jsfiddle I'd be happy to help
[16:27:25] <FernandoBasso> Can't find a way to have a global variable created in the main script to be used by other script when loaded with getScript().
[16:27:36] <pepijndevos> MistuhKurtz, , So I have <ul ondragenter=bar><li>foo</li></ul>, and bar gets called when the mouse enters the li.
[16:28:38] <ArtificialEX> whats the opposite of preventdefault?
[16:29:02] <ArtificialEX> e.re-engageDefault(); ?
[16:29:19] <MistuhKurtz> pepijndevos, this might help: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[16:29:26] <ArtificialEX> e.initiateDefault(); ?
[16:31:09] <ArtificialEX> e.re-engage-establish-initiateDefault(); ?
[16:31:15] <MistuhKurtz> pretty sure there is no such thing ArtificialEX
[16:31:52] <shoky> just add // before e.preventDefault()  and magic ensues
[16:32:05] <ArtificialEX> well I'm submitting a form. I had to stop the form submission to add a hidden value
[16:32:09] <ArtificialEX> now I need the form to submit
[16:32:35] <pepijndevos> MistuhKurtz, not matter which order they go, it will still trigger the event on the root when it enters a child.
[16:32:45] <MistuhKurtz> ArtificialEX, form.submit();
[16:32:54] <MistuhKurtz> where form is the DOM object, -not- the jQuery collection
[16:33:49] <MistuhKurtz> if it's in a callback, it would be like this: $("form").submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault; /* Do stuff here */ this.submit(); }
[16:33:52] <MistuhKurtz> I think
[16:34:08] <MistuhKurtz> I've only really done it when using the jquery validate plugin, which has a submit handler
[16:34:18] <ArtificialEX> I had $('#btnLogoSubmit').click(function(e) {
[16:34:19] <pepijndevos> MistuhKurtz, I guess I need to say something like if(root_element == where_the_event_happened)
[16:34:22] <ArtificialEX> maybe I should do form.submit instead
[16:34:37] <MistuhKurtz> ArtificialEX, yes you should bind your code to the form's submit event
[16:34:41] <MistuhKurtz> then do the rest as i said
[16:34:43] <MistuhKurtz> I think it should work
[16:34:45] <BinaryKitten> if you're hooking submit
[16:34:54] <BinaryKitten> then e.preventDefault will stop it submitting
[16:35:18] <MistuhKurtz> thought that might need to go, ty BinaryKitten
[16:35:31] <BinaryKitten> np
[16:36:03] <ArtificialEX> yeah that fixed it
[16:36:33] <ArtificialEX> so I'm using laravel framework... but the problem now I have is when I handle the form in the controller, I redirect to the page
[16:36:45] <ArtificialEX> but the image I was uploading does not always appear, unless I refresh the page, even though it does uplad
[16:36:48] <ArtificialEX> upload*
[16:45:35] <MistuhKurtz> how do you like laravel ArtificialEX ? Do they  have an example app on github?
[16:51:08] <ArtificialEX> MistuhKurtz: laravel is so amazing. I am a beginner / intermediate php/javascript developer. Laravel makes me feel like a pro
[16:51:29] <MistuhKurtz> did you cross-shop other frameworks?
[16:51:29] <ArtificialEX> In a month I've recreated what a client payed $20,000 outsourced to india to develop a real estate application
[16:52:08] <ArtificialEX> yeah, I toyed with Yii, CI, Kohana, Zend, and DooPHP for at least months
[16:52:33] <ArtificialEX> just trying to learn one that was a good fit. Usually would go in circles deciding. The community and documentation is what made me feel instantly at home with Laravel
[16:53:11] <ArtificialEX> i'm putting my app on github and online in about an hour
[16:54:04] <ArtificialEX> this will help you love Laravel: http://codehappy.daylerees.com/
[16:55:10] <Oakho> Hello everyone, could someone tell me if there's a way to test scroll position with QUnit, can't find a way to do that atm ?
[16:55:50] <ArtificialEX> MistuhKurtz: http://www.getplatform.com/ has a cool laravel app you can ddemo. it basically gives you the basics, its like a bootstrap for laravel
[16:57:10] <MistuhKurtz> ty ArtificialEX
[16:57:23] <ArtificialEX> np, #laravel people are really niec
[16:57:31] <MistuhKurtz> I'm curious how it compares to Lithium
[16:58:52] <ArtificialEX> havent seem lithium, good documentation is most interesting to me
[17:02:22] <MistuhKurtz> one thing I like about lithium is the folder structure is designed to work pretty nicely with git submodules
[17:07:42] <FernandoBasso> http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/Forms/02_dyn/ Could someone test this? Basicaly, you click in "Indicar + um amigo" and another div opens with some files. The "e-mail" field should output its contents to console every time a 'blur' event occurs on it.
[17:08:20] <FernandoBasso> However, sometimes, it work if I open several 'new divs', and test by typing something from the last to first.
[17:08:49] <FernandoBasso> some fields*
[17:09:46] <FernandoBasso> The only ones that should print something to the console are the "email" fields.
[17:14:37] <sunbeam> I use the jquery datepicker() function. How can I disable the input field from editing by the user? I use the buttonImage option
[17:14:47] <ravster> Is it acceptable to define jquery for id's that aren't present on the webpage at the time of loading? I'm still a bit new to how js handles things.
[17:15:00] <sunbeam> so that the user cannot fill data there manually? Just by clicking ON the input field OR the buttonImage
[17:27:56] <pts\3> i have an input with class="add". when it blurs, i append a row which includes another input.add - yet when this appended element blurs, nothing happens. please see http://jsbin.com/agowec/1/edit for reference
[17:52:17] <Whirl3d> Good evenin' all.
[18:00:12] <MistuhKurtz> hay Whirl3d
[18:03:04] <Whirl3d> How's it goin?
[18:12:13] <Whirl3d> jeeesh the opening ceremony for the olympics is so bad I hope they put the director behind bars.
[18:13:22] <MistuhKurtz> lool
[18:13:25] <MistuhKurtz> i've been hearing that
[18:15:12] <ptomter> Hi, I try to use following code to define a mask for a field, but I doesnt get it to work. Any suggestions ? $(document).ready(function(){
[18:15:12] <ptomter> 	$('.edit-field-vektere-und-0-field-p-jobb-und-0-value').mask("99:99");
[18:15:12] <ptomter> 	$('.edit-field-vektere-und-0-field-av-jobb-und-0-value-date').mask("99:99");
[18:15:12] <ptomter> })
[18:17:16] <Whirl3d> ptomter, unless you are really experienced with jquery and javascript and have some time on your hands and love a challenge, I would suggest using any one of the numerous input mask plugins.
[18:21:30] <TrentonDAdams> Hi Guys.  I have http://pastebin.ca/2175321.  If I click a couple of links that make ajax calls, really quickly one after the other, my loading div never disappears.  Is this a bug, or am I doing it incorrectly?
[18:39:53] <ptomter> Hi please help me with the following: http://pastebin.ca/2175327 - I want the masking also to work on new fields.
[18:44:25] <olinux> ptomter, perhaps http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:44:39] <olinux> and attach on a class
[18:56:36] <_cb> doing some testing function vf_test(){alert(55);}  <a id = 'id_test' href= 'javascript:alert(99);' ...     $(function() {$("#id_test").click(vf_test);...  I get a 55 and then a 99. Was expecting only a 55
[18:58:16] <lotus_droid> _cb try event.preventdefault
[18:59:16] <lotus_droid> U can. Put event in param of click handler function
[19:01:53] <_cb> lotus_droid that worked so .click chains too instead of replacing?
[19:02:12] <_cb> chains to the event handler instea of reaplacing the event handler that is
[19:15:03] <Big_> okay so i have a jquery function that removes the selected option from one multiple select to the other
[19:15:05] <Big_> return !$('#select1 option:selected').remove().appendTo('#select2');
[19:15:28] <Big_> how do i make just copy it to the other rather then removing from the first? any help appreciated/
[19:16:38] <Big_> any takers??
[19:22:04] <acidjazz> so whats the sweet new way to go fullscreen.. is there a non-flash way?
[19:28:23] <neebly> any one have a minute to help me?
[19:43:14] <_cb> neebly ask the question if someone knows the answer they will answer
[19:44:27] <neebly> Okay but just such a long question lol, I am in a big stump. I paid a lil over 100 dollars for this ebook for my class, because recently broke my back and cant carry a heavy load.
[19:44:44] <neebly> The book could only viewed online and not offline nor printed
[19:44:49] <neebly> it is all flash based
[19:44:55] <neebly> as2 non encrypted
[19:45:07] <neebly> however I loaded up wireshark
[19:45:20] <neebly> and sniffed the packets, page loads up main swwf
[19:45:22] <neebly> *swf
[19:45:24] <MacPolles> Hello guys and girls :D how are you all?
[19:45:34] <neebly> then that load the page swf
[19:45:43] <neebly> but non of them actually have the book]
[19:45:49] <neebly> been poking at this for 2 weeks
[19:45:57] <neebly> not asking for someone to do the work for me
[19:46:07] <neebly> but point me out in the right direction
[19:46:19] <neebly> with more experencise than I do
[19:46:24] <neebly> here is a demo of the book
[19:46:28] <neebly> http://panorama4e.vhlcentral.com/media/vtext/panorama4e_demo/book.html
[19:46:53] <phonebook_> a gigantic picture?
[19:46:56] <phonebook_> you are in luck
[19:47:04] <neebly> I know it is alot of work involed but if anyone is willing to look over it for a few minutes and points me the direction
[19:47:20] <neebly> I would be ind debt with you
[19:47:28] <phonebook_> its a huge ass picture, whats the problem? height and width = 1000
[19:47:57] <neebly> that is just the cover page
[19:48:03] <phonebook_> you are right, im an ass
[19:48:06] <neebly> there is more to the book
[19:48:09] <neebly> oh ahhah
[19:48:17] <phonebook_> youre trying to make a book like that?
[19:48:29] <neebly> I am trying to rip it to something like a pdf
[19:48:33] <neebly> so i can view it offline
[19:48:38] <phonebook_> ohhhhhh..
[19:49:08] <phonebook_> step 1 bust out fiddler...
[19:49:34] <neebly> lol seriously, a helping hand out there? I just did a direction
[19:49:35] <_cb> Just record the sessions and then you can play it offline
[19:50:09] <neebly> well I would like to flip to any page at any desired time
[19:50:16] <neebly> or I would record it
[19:50:18] <phonebook_> if you use fiddler to get the requests and responses and then emulate them with c# and rebuild the images you could print it all out into a word document
[19:50:49] <neebly> thank you, this is all new to me but I am will look into it!!!
[19:50:53] <phonebook_> wait
[19:50:57] <neebly> okay
[19:50:58] <MacPolles> How i can make that images load after the page load with i am thinking of only a few images at the beginning and then when the user clicks on an arrow the new image is download ??
[19:51:01] <phonebook_> that will be way too hard
[19:51:18] <phonebook_> i htink the easiest way would be copy and paste
[19:51:31] <MacPolles> any body know about an slider that do this job?
[19:51:55] <neebly> unforuntaley it wont let me copy the text
[19:52:32] <phonebook_> i mean pictures
[19:53:01] <phonebook_> i mean what i said is doable... but it would be a huge huge pain in the ass... third party libraries... poor documentation... im just saying its too hard unless you have 5000 of these books you want
[19:53:33] <qwe> neebly, what are you looking for?
[19:53:45] <neebly> I see, I might result to print screening it however that is also a pain and not as good quality
[19:54:11] <neebly> @qwe ripping this site into an offline document http://panorama4e.vhlcentral.com/media/vtext/panorama4e_demo/book.html
[19:54:30] <phonebook_> oh..
[19:54:35] <qwe> hrm
[19:54:43] <phonebook_> cache, html5 manifest...
[19:55:29] <neebly> @phonebook are you saying look in the cache for a html5 manifest, sorry
[19:55:38] <phonebook_> just thinking out loud
[19:55:52] <phonebook_> or looking at it right now in fiddler to see what the requests look like
[19:56:08] <qwe> it's everything in flash
[19:56:19] <qwe> both the menus and the page content
[19:57:09] <qwe> you have no clue where the real document is stored, do you?
[19:57:38] <neebly> @phonebook thank you for your time on looking at this! and @qwe no unforuntaley not
[19:57:43] <neebly> i decompilied the swf
[19:57:50] <neebly> and found no source so i have no clue
[19:58:16] <qwe> well there's a good reason for making that in flash
[19:58:47] <phonebook_> its not hopeless
[19:58:50] <qwe> and you hit that
[19:59:11] <phonebook_> fiddler didnt give a quick help though.. almost http://panorama4e.vhlcentral.com/media/vtext/panorama4e_demo/data/swf/panorama_demo/0071.swf
[19:59:14] <phonebook_> ...which doesnt work
[19:59:30] <qwe> like a ball hits the wall
[19:59:58] <neebly> Yeah i found that link and decompiled it and had no source only the screen height
[20:00:08] <neebly> this is where i am stumped what to do
[20:00:14] <phonebook_> hmm
[20:01:20] <neebly> here is the source on that 0071.swf if it helps anyone out!
[20:01:21] <neebly> http://pastebin.com/Q6YRXTeA
[20:01:26] <phonebook_> so it loads the page which has a .swf and the .swf gets xml and other content and then builds the books pages
[20:02:03] <qwe> the .swf also gets the book id
[20:02:23] <phonebook_> k...
[20:02:28] <qwe> parameter bookID
[20:03:02] <neebly> yikes that is a tricky slope to start from
[20:03:33] <phonebook_> super ghetto but might work.... c# - global mouse clicks... have it clock on a spot that is where the nest page button is. ... then alt+printscreen and save the window into a .bmp.... phase three, assemble the .bmps into a word document... easy
[20:03:39] <qwe> what you posted is irrelevant btw
[20:03:54] <phonebook_> *click
[20:04:02] <qwe> it merely sets visibility (not yet got why but it is irrelefvant anyway)
[20:04:41] <qwe> you should look for the string bookID in the source and follow program flow starting from that
[20:04:56] <phonebook_> wait
[20:05:00] <phonebook_> i think this is double
[20:05:06] <phonebook_> you can switch pages with LR keys too
[20:05:15] <phonebook_> so it woudl go like this with a keybopard library...
[20:05:30] <phonebook_> alt+printscreen --> R.... wait.... rinse repeat
[20:05:56] <phonebook_> thats my answer neebly
[20:06:02] <phonebook_> get you a c# keyboard library
[20:06:40] <neebly> @phonebook i most likely going to do that approach as it is certain that would work and very little work would be needed to put in other than writting the code for the automated program
[20:06:40] <b-ot> neebly, memorised “it”.
[20:06:42] <neebly> thank you
[20:07:03] <qwe> well than maybe this could help http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/
[20:07:20] <phonebook_> good luck man... those libraries can be a pain... they dont always work right out of the box
[20:07:55] <neebly> thank you @phonebook and @qwe!
[20:08:23] <qwe> yw
[20:10:08] <qwe> it's essentially going to use win32 C APIs to simulate keypress, now either you call the functions directly, or have some .NET wrapper to save you from dealing with the DLLs
[20:10:10] <qwe> directly
[20:10:45] <qwe> channels #winapi and #windows could be helpful
[20:11:00] <qwe> if something goes wrong
[20:12:47] <neebly> Before I do that, I would like to poke around at  your last comment on getting the bookid which is "panorama4e"
[20:13:13] <neebly> I will see how far I can go from that info but mostly likely i will get stuck again and simulate that program
[20:13:17] <qwe> hrm, in page source I read
[20:13:18] <qwe> 		fo.addVariable("bookID", "panorama_demo");
[20:13:21] <qwe> line 93
[20:13:23] <neebly> and have this thing done
[20:13:29] <neebly> That is just for the demo
[20:13:34] <neebly> the paid verison is "panorama4e"
[20:13:45] <qwe> oh
[20:20:17] <neebly> Hate to keep bugging you guys but is it possible to make the screen to the max (220%; for the best resoulation) and print the whole screen
[20:20:25] <neebly> not just the screen displayed on my laptop?
[20:22:03] <qwe> don't worry, there's no jquery-strictly related question to be processed atm
[20:23:18] <neebly> @qwe thank man, about to write the program in VS however when I click print screen, it only shows the the picture of what is being displayed
[20:23:19] <b-ot> neebly, memorised “what”.
[20:23:24] <neebly> not the whole frame
[20:25:47] <neebly> only way really so far is zoom out of the page to 40% and click print screen but then that looks like crap
[20:27:33] <phonebook_> i graduated from DeVry online - no surprise there - and they did the same crap - electronic books you dont get to keep
[20:27:44] <phonebook_> plus a zillion dollars so i coudl teach myself
[20:28:23] <phonebook_> i took an ebook into staples once and asked them to print it and they told me to go away
[20:29:23] <neebly> @phonebook totally un revelant but your username reminds of the group "phone losers of america" heard of them? ahha
[20:29:35] <neebly> 8relevant
[20:29:38] <neebly> *relevant
[20:29:58] <neebly> http://www.phonelosers.org/
[20:31:09] <qwe> maybe i'm totally wrong, but once I enlarged windows resolution so much that I actually I got the desktop enlarged
[20:31:40] <qwe> and thus the window size
[20:32:00] <qwe> so you could do the same thing and see whether it either sticks to what it appears on the monitor or prints everything
[20:32:10] <phonebook_> looks like a cool clib neebly
[20:32:14] <phonebook_> i mean club
[20:32:20] <qwe> for 'windows' above I mean from the desktop settings
[20:33:50] <phonebook_> where did you hear about the PLA?
[20:35:33] <neebly> @qwe I will try it out right now
[20:35:52] <neebly> around 5 years ago and since then im addicted to their radio
[20:36:05] <neebly> I forgot where though
[20:36:36] <phonebook_> its just interesting what media is
[20:44:39] <phonebook_> hey does anyone have the gumption to make a stock bot with me?
[20:45:27] <phonebook_> http://pastebin.com/STbsGjbD | http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l493/powerfulcrunch/stockbot.png
[20:46:11] <phonebook_> just some code i have been working on.. not sure of what the best strategy is.... project uses asp.net (maybe would switch to php), and jquery and jquery ui
[20:46:50] <phonebook_> tradeking api
[20:48:57] <phonebook_> ive been monitoring for eight days.... looks like very few stocks rise for 8 days straight so i need a new strategy
[20:49:11] <phonebook_> *8 trading days
[20:58:06] <martisj> are there any good articles on styling drop down boxes?
[20:58:59] <gnarf> martisj: not that I'm aware of, but there are some crazy awesome select box replacements in JS like Chozen http://webification.com/tag/chozen-select-javascript
[20:59:17] <martisj> gnarf: thanks :)
[20:59:31] <gnarf> wrong link
[20:59:32] <gnarf> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[20:59:34] <gnarf> martisj: ^^^
[20:59:43] <martisj> I'm looking to get something like this : https://theconsole.netregistry.com.au/execute2/store/domain-search
[21:00:01] <martisj> if you can't get through just select a domain and have a look at the drop down at the bottom of the page :
[21:00:02] <martisj> )
[21:00:11] <martisj> gnarf: thanks mater

[21:03:51] <phonebook_> dropdown/select: http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l493/powerfulcrunch/dropdown.png | https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/wiki/Selectmenu
[21:04:11] <phonebook_> thats the one i chose for a jquery ui project... worked the best for me ~4 months ago
[21:04:58] <martisj> phonebook_: thnaks
[21:05:22] <phonebook_> i spent several days looking through the options
[21:08:53] <martisj> phonebook_: really ?
[21:09:00] <martisj> did you check out chosen?
[21:09:03] <martisj> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[21:09:22] <dschuett> i am trying to find a way to disable all dropdown list items excepts for 3: i am trying this:  http://pastie.org/4346613   but it disables ALL items. Any ideas?
[21:09:41] <gnarf> phonebook_: chosen is really f'n cool
[21:09:50] <phonebook_> yeah thats perfect
[21:09:52] <fris> ahh thought you meant drop down menu not form elemtn ;)
[21:10:00] <phonebook_> thats better than what i posted, use that!
[21:10:44] <gnarf> martisj: phonebook_: a friend of mine linked me to that about 2 months ago, and it has stuck out in my mind as the best in class plugin for that
[21:10:58] <phonebook_> a little flashign though and maybe not a strict adherance to jquery ui
[21:11:05] <phonebook_> the one i posted will conform to any jquery ui theme
[21:11:26] <phonebook_> give and take maybe
[21:12:09] <gnarf> is that the old filament group one?
[21:12:28] <gnarf> yeah
[21:12:30] <phonebook_> harvest
[21:12:43] <gnarf> the one you posted, fnagel's SelectMenu
[21:12:48] <gnarf> builds on top of filament groups
[21:13:01] <gnarf> pretty sure thats the one we are considering including in UI
[21:13:11] <phonebook_> i read they were going to incorporate a select into jquery ui
[21:13:23] <gnarf> I really want to see if we can't get more of the "chosen" features into it tho
[21:13:33] <gnarf> that "tagging" interface for multiple selects is pretty amazing
[21:14:38] <gnarf> phonebook_: yeah, i think SelectMenu is 1.11 UI
[21:14:48] <phonebook_> whats tagging?
[21:15:12] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/403B2y3U1R1P
[21:15:15] <gnarf> ^^^
[21:16:06] <phonebook_> oh tagging
[21:16:11] <qwe> dschuett: the 2nd IS working
[21:16:54] <qwe> it's meaning is disable all items
[21:18:20] <qwe> maybe in the 2nd you meant to remove the :not operators and to set disabled to false?
[21:18:54] <qwe> you know, not disabled means enabled
[21:30:03] <rhino__> how can I have my page move back to where it was after using the jquery .load?
[21:30:49] <rhino__> I.E. the same y coordinate?
[21:32:41] <qwe> load() does change the y coordinate of the page?
[21:38:29] <phonebook_> good point... move?
[21:38:33] <phonebook_> its moving?
[21:39:38] * phonebook_ puts on nightly dunts hat
[21:40:01] <phonebook_> it should not move.. unless your users are easily impressed
[21:40:09] <phonebook_> ... do you sell 5 hour energy?
[21:47:28] <maxw3st> Hello, new to this just checking to see what happens. Was getting a jQuery/JavaScript lesson on twitter and 140 characters at a time is just a pain.
[21:48:43] <gnarf> maxw3st: :)
[21:49:24] <gnarf> maxw3st: trust me, the help in #jquery will be a little better ;)
[21:49:50] <gnarf> although who knows, its just as likely to get bad advice here as anywhere, but here you have quite a few team members/experts sitting around all day
[21:50:28] <maxw3st> ok think I see how this works. Nite all. back in a couple weeks when I finish my ActionScript3 class. Feel like I'm learning the scripting equivalent of Latin there (deprecated language-AS), but have to finish the course to graduate. Will be back to JS/jQuery shortly. Need to nail down the difference between JSON and an object's propery:value stack.
[21:50:38] <maxw3st> Ah, there you are.
[21:50:47] <maxw3st> popped in while I was typing
[21:50:55] <qwe> maxw3st: see also the channel logs, they're linked in the channel topic
[21:52:15] <maxw3st> where do I find "channel topic"? I'm using mIRC
[21:52:31] <qwe> [jQuery 1.7.2 http://jquery.com - 1.8rc1 bit.ly/jq18rc1  | jQuery UI 1.8.22 http://jqueryui.com - 1.9b1 http://bit.ly/jqueryui19b1 | jQuery Mobile 1.1 http://jquerymobile.com | Docs: http://api.jquery.com | Paste code at http://jsfiddle.net | Mobile support #jquerymobile | Dev Channels #jquery-dev #jqueryui-dev #jquerymobile-dev | Channel publicly logged to http://irc.jquery.com/ ♥]
[21:52:43] <qwe> i'm on freenode :p
[21:54:04] <phonebook_> 7 minutes before they stop selling beer
[21:54:08] <phonebook_> 6
[21:54:22] <qwe> hurry up then
[21:54:29] <phonebook_> no one can program this late without beer
[21:54:57] <phonebook_> the amish maybe ha ha ha...sry
[21:55:10] <maxw3st> Thank you much gnarf, and you as well qwe, yes, I'm familiar with JSFiddle, use it for CSS/HTML occasionally.
[21:55:27] <tw2113> http://beeripsum.com/
[21:55:50] <phonebook_> any fbi agents in here willing to get me on only one offense?
[21:56:07] <phonebook_> cmon... ill stop before you bait me 10 times and call it justice
[21:56:08] <qwe> yes, my point however was the logs not the fiddle
[21:56:28] <maxw3st> The Amish around here smoke some stuff that makes beer seem like water
[21:56:31] <phonebook_> you all know they are in here btw?
[21:56:42] <phonebook_> the cops see and monitor and keylogg all that happens in here
[21:57:04] <phonebook_> i know because i am one
[21:57:12] <gnarf> phonebook_: wtf u babblin on about?
[21:57:22] <maxw3st> I assume they, homeboy security, NSA, and DIA are all listening to and recording everything online all the time.
[21:57:23] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure its entirely unrelated to jQuery ;)
[21:57:39] <tw2113> $('#me').fbi()
[21:57:55] <phonebook_> idk... founding fathers... freddom.. individual protection against an overbearing govt
[21:57:59] <phonebook_> but
[21:58:07] <phonebook_> its relevent because it applies to irc and this room too
[21:58:11] <phonebook_> and you should all know
[21:58:26] <tw2113> libertarian politics and #jquery ?
[21:58:31] <phonebook_> the cops watch every roomon irc... and im not crazy... can you write a scarper??? so can the irs
[21:58:41] <phonebook_> i mean ...fbi..cia... whatever
[21:58:46] <gnarf> phonebook_: assuming that any room with public logs is hidden from "spies" is silly
[21:58:58] <phonebook_> its somewhat relevent dont boot me pls
[21:59:08] <phonebook_> righto gnarf
[21:59:08] <maxw3st> $('screw').you(.dont("care")){('just.here'.'for.jQuery')};
[21:59:13] <gnarf> it really isn't ;)
[21:59:27] <tw2113> less paranoia about public logs and the government, more questions about jQuery issues for client work
[21:59:31] * phonebook_ thinks scopes
[21:59:34] <qwe> gnarf: few freenode rooms are publicly logged
[21:59:53] <qwe> although I wish they were
[21:59:57] <qwe> more
[22:00:02] <qwe> there were more*
[22:00:06] <phonebook_> im trying to help you expand your horizons.. maybe not all jquery but maybe would make you a better programmer in general
[22:00:10] <gnarf> qwe: true - it's also freenode policy to force OPS to include the logs in the topic
[22:00:17] <gnarf> if it is logged
[22:00:25] <qwe> Yep.
[22:00:39] <maxw3st> nite all, thanks for all the help this eve. gnarf. back in a couple weeks when I get AS3 out of my life. Just wanted to get this set up and running.
[22:00:49] <LifeSF> hi can anyone tell me why some added jquery plugins stop working when i add new ones...? ie: header plugins stop functionning when i add the footer plugins?
[22:00:56] <qwe> Problem is that they do not decide to log.
[22:01:23] <gnarf> LifeSF: define "stop working" - is there an error in the console?
[22:01:23] <qwe> This deprives newbies of offline instructive discussions.
[22:02:08] <gnarf> qwe: you mean freenode? public logging isn't an option for any IRC network
[22:02:16] <gnarf> there are channels where private discussion is held
[22:02:20] <phonebook_> they can just be in here guys
[22:02:23] <phonebook_> like you or me
[22:02:27] <phonebook_> i coudl be a govt bot
[22:02:27] <LifeSF> well.. by stop working,...  ... if you look at this page: http://wiziwigi.com/Fr/index.php  the letters on the top left cycle,.. but if i add a certain plugin in the footer,... that top left animation becomes all of the images side by side and thats it
[22:02:30] <phonebook_> you know that, right?
[22:02:34] <qwe> I mean #linux (just to take an example) does not have public logs
[22:02:54] <qwe> although it is allowed
[22:03:00] <phonebook_> and if i am a govt bot its reasonable to assume that an insane govt would have bots in as many places as possibl
[22:03:07] <qwe> that's just an example
[22:03:18] <phonebook_> ein they sky
[22:03:22] <phonebook_> i mean predator drones
[22:03:26] <gnarf> phonebook_: of course, what difference does it make? its not like we are plotting to do illegal things here...
[22:03:32] <phonebook_> true
[22:03:34] <phonebook_> true
[22:03:35] <phonebook_> but
[22:03:39] <phonebook_> illegal?
[22:03:42] * tw2113 thinks phonebook_ is from the guberment
[22:03:42] <phonebook_> whats that?
[22:03:48] <maxw3st> using jQuery is legal right?
[22:03:52] <phonebook_> for now
[22:03:54] <ArtificialEX> hey, im not sure how I should store 'Markitup' (wysiwyg) in MySQL database... its losing it's formatting
[22:03:58] <phonebook_> until google owns it
[22:04:10] <tw2113> i don't think google can
[22:04:15] <tw2113> and if they try, it can be forked
[22:04:16] <ArtificialEX> microsoft owns jquery...
[22:04:23] <phonebook_> time warner owns happy birthday
[22:04:24] <gnarf> ArtificialEX: have you tried using a debugger to inspect the data you are submitting?
[22:04:39] <tw2113> "happy birthday" is copywritten still
[22:04:44] <tw2113> jQuery isn't
[22:05:03] <phonebook_> law is this
[22:05:03] <ArtificialEX> no gnarf... ive only used the Elements tab of chrome debugger
[22:05:09] <phonebook_> they make shit up to do what they want
[22:05:13] <phonebook_> that is what law is
[22:05:27] <maxw3st> Quit
[22:05:29] <ArtificialEX> is that what your takling about ?chrome web tools?
[22:05:31] <gnarf> ArtificialEX: does it include <html> or is it just stripped down text - also most wysiwyg editors give you a "get the formatted text" function
[22:05:37] <phonebook_> you quit, ive read my books
[22:05:50] <gnarf> ArtificialEX: look at the network tab and see what form data you are submitting
[22:06:11] <tw2113> you also haven't read about GPL/MIT licenses
[22:06:17] <phonebook_> yes i have
[22:06:55] <ArtificialEX> im not sure i'm finding it....
[22:07:01] <gnarf> tw2113: actually jQuery is (c) jQuery Foundation and contributors
[22:07:17] <phonebook_> as i just stated
[22:07:19] <phonebook_> the law is
[22:07:30] <phonebook_> they do what they want and then make up shit to do what they want
[22:07:31] <tw2113> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/GPL-LICENSE.txt
[22:07:33] <phonebook_> that is the law
[22:07:35] <gnarf> tw2113: we release the code under the MIT license
[22:07:37] <phonebook_> that is the law
[22:07:52] <gnarf> tw2113: GPL is an option under MIT, so we "dual license" it
[22:07:57] <tw2113> ;)
[22:08:04] <phonebook_> hold on
[22:08:08] <phonebook_> i have an isbn
[22:08:08] * tw2113 steals phonebook_'s tin foil jQuery selector
[22:08:41] <gnarf> phonebook_: enough law/conspiracy babble please - as slow as it is, can we try to stick to talking about jQuery support around here, or topics more closely related to jQuery - thanks
[22:08:42] <phonebook_> 0-495-09543-5
[22:08:43] <LifeSF> is anyone able to help me figure out why one stops when i add another?
[22:08:50] <phonebook_> come back in a couple months
[22:09:00] <phonebook_> also... get some first hand experience on the bitch side
[22:09:05] <phonebook_> then you can talk to me
[22:09:50] <tw2113> do we have to?
[22:10:00] <phonebook_> no
[22:10:04] <tw2113> yays!
[22:10:11] <phonebook_> tw.. i remember you
[22:10:12] <gnarf> LifeSF: figuring it out is 80% of the problem - are you familiar with your debugging tools?
[22:10:35] <gnarf> LifeSF: also - some plugins are written better than others, and some plugins can totally mess with your code
[22:10:36] <LifeSF> i'm honestly a beginner and trying to learn all of this with google and everything i can find on the net
[22:10:48] <gnarf> LifeSF: check out http://fixingthesejquery.com
[22:11:10] <LifeSF> doing that live, thank you :)
[22:11:33] <phonebook_> get it at a used book store for $10
[22:11:43] <phonebook_> whats it called
[22:11:55] <gnarf> LifeSF: also - new to programming or javascript, or jquery, or all of it?
[22:11:59] <phonebook_> bed bath and beyond... no....half price books
[22:12:01] <phonebook_> $10
[22:12:10] <phonebook_> it might save you from the death penalty one day
[22:12:22] <gnarf> LifeSF: i can give you some other links too
[22:12:52] <gnarf> phonebook_: please? :)
[22:12:56] <LifeSF> gnarf: all! :S ... but i seem to learn a bit here and there and i try to mash everything up and then evidently end up in some messed up dead-endsbut i do what i can with what i have
[22:13:00] <phonebook_> i was being completely serious
[22:13:08] <phonebook_> it might safve you from the death penalty
[22:13:13] <gnarf> phonebook_: so was I
[22:13:14] <phonebook_> *save
[22:13:21] <phonebook_> so was i * infinite
[22:13:24] <gnarf> phonebook_: the death penalty is really not jQuery related
[22:13:24] <phonebook_> it might
[22:13:28] <phonebook_> oh
[22:13:34] <phonebook_> there i agree
[22:13:51] <gnarf> LifeSF: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn
[22:15:07] <LifeSF> Thank You very much gnarf, i will read up on those! :)
[22:19:26] <phonebook_> is it too soon for me to ask a theoritical jquery question?
[22:19:29] <gnarf> LifeSF: sorry to not just have a magic bullet answer for you about plugin interoperability, but I find that debugging it, and reading/understanding the source of any plugin I include in my site really helps learn the craft.  When I was starting I found I very often didn't even need the plugin by the time I've read and understood the code :)
[22:19:45] <phonebook_> i have a topic
[22:19:54] <phonebook_> jquery related
[22:20:26] <phonebook_> what is the need for real artists in the dom... programmers are not often artists..
[22:20:41] <gnarf> you also have an approximately 1:5 signal to noise ratio right now.
[22:20:50] <phonebook_> k will so do you
[22:20:59] <phonebook_> and
[22:21:07] <phonebook_> actually you are right, looking up
[22:21:34] <tw2113> real artists in the dom?
[22:21:39] <phonebook_> yes
[22:21:44] <phonebook_> real artists in the dom
[22:22:01] <phonebook_> somoene who can draw a dragon with a pencil
[22:22:07] <ArtificialEX> anyone use markitup?
[22:22:08] <tw2113> what about them?
[22:22:13] <phonebook_> we need them
[22:22:17] <phonebook_> our divs suck
[22:23:01] <tw2113> unsuckify them
[22:23:04] <phonebook_> i think artists are underrated in IT
[22:23:06] <ArtificialEX> i cant get my markitup wysiwyg to store its formatting
[22:23:18] <tw2113> find yourself a good designer
[22:23:20] <gnarf> phonebook_: elegant code is an art form, one that people can't necessarily appreciate without being a coder themselves, but it is definitely an art.
[22:23:28] <phonebook_> programmers dont make visual art... they make art that no one gives a crap about
[22:24:05] <phonebook_> i can write a 10 line recursive function in jquery that will boggle the mind... but no one cares.... its not a nake dfairy
[22:24:10] <phonebook_> *naked fairy
[22:24:19] <tw2113> and you're just fine
[22:24:34] <tw2113> *points* DUCK! IMMIGRATION!
[22:24:48] <phonebook_> straight lines ! trigonometry, no art.... !3d... will lose very soon
[22:26:10] <tw2113> cool fact about you being on the jQuery board gnarf
[22:27:21] <gnarf> phonebook_: http://demoseen.com/windowpane/magister.png.html
[22:27:36] <gnarf> phonebook_: 1k of javascript compressed in a PNG drawn on a canvas
[22:27:47] <binaryfus10nz> can you use live for hover?
[22:28:01] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: don't use live
[22:28:10] <binaryfus10nz> bind mousenter mouseleave?
[22:28:13] <phonebook_> its good for sure
[22:28:31] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: and yes, you can bind a delegated mouseenter and mouseleave
[22:28:33] <phonebook_> i have no idea how to do it
[22:28:43] <binaryfus10nz> does bind need to be outside doc ready
[22:29:03] <phonebook_> which is why i think we need more artists
[22:29:07] <gnarf> phonebook_: WebGL brings 3d / textures, etc to supported browsers, etc
[22:29:14] <gnarf> phonebook_: there are good people working on these things
[22:29:14] <phonebook_> like artists are the new programmers and programmers are the new accountants
[22:29:22] <phonebook_> we are lame
[22:29:50] <tw2113> it's 1 thing to make a website design that looks nice
[22:29:53] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: if you are using jQuery 1.7+ (which you should be) - always use .on() for events now
[22:30:03] <tw2113> it's another thing to make it look that way and function well
[22:30:29] <phonebook_> .on(click.tmp, function() { // for namespaced
[22:30:46] <binaryfus10nz> can you help me gnarf ? take a quick look @ http://oneinvestmentone.com/property-listings/
[22:30:59] <binaryfus10nz> when page is laoding and you hover 'view details... the fade on/off works but I think ajax breaks it?
[22:31:05] <tw2113> personal opinion says it's an awesome time to be a webdev right now
[22:31:24] <phonebook_> i just think we need more artits andmore trigonometry and 3d
[22:31:32] <phonebook_> moving blocks... yay...
[22:31:37] <phonebook_> we need cool real shit
[22:32:23] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: sorry i'm not sure i follow the instructions to reproduce
[22:32:26] <tw2113> phonebook_ http://processing.org/
[22:32:33] <gnarf> which view details, when i hover them they don't seem to do anything (Chrome 20)
[22:32:42] <phonebook_> looks cool
[22:32:46] <binaryfus10nz> you have to do it b4 the spinning house fades out
[22:32:55] <phonebook_> but ive got a good 20 hours in raphael
[22:33:15] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: still nothing
[22:33:40] <phonebook_> have an example somewhere... if you see me later ask me to post... its just a grid
[22:33:50] <gnarf> also, the "spinning house" is grey
[22:33:54] <binaryfus10nz> gnarf, hit refresh and mouse over a view details quick youll see it go black
[22:33:56] <phonebook_> in jquery
[22:34:05] <phonebook_> in jquery... using jqueryui double points
[22:34:19] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: yeah
[22:34:26] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: gotcha
[22:34:30] <binaryfus10nz> wonder why it breaks from the ajax
[22:34:35] <qwe> mouse over 'view details' does nothing on my chrome either
[22:34:42] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: so - where is the code that binds that event?
[22:34:50] <gnarf> also - why not just use :hover in CSS
[22:34:56] <binaryfus10nz> line 84 in ogk.js
[22:35:07] <binaryfus10nz> I guess thats fine but its so weird
[22:35:15] <binaryfus10nz> does hover not work on ajax content
[22:35:19] <phonebook_> :hover=best
[22:35:38] <phonebook_> user:hover whenever possible
[22:35:47] <binaryfus10nz> instead of .hover for text fade?
[22:36:02] <binaryfus10nz> look at bottom right footer links tho color fade is 1000x nicer than on/off
[22:36:20] <binaryfus10nz> or left wrather sorry
[22:36:25] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: when you inject the HTML into the page replacing the old html, all events bound on those elements are removed
[22:36:32] <gnarf> because the elements are removed....
[22:36:40] <phonebook_> :hover after a css selector.... .fade// if that is a jquery thing... on a jquery object
[22:36:42] <binaryfus10nz> yes so thats why I was thinking to use live..
[22:36:51] <binaryfus10nz> thanks phonebook_ what would I do without you lol
[22:36:57] <phonebook_> lol idk
[22:37:03] <phonebook_> is everyone making fun of me
[22:37:04] <phonebook_> ?
[22:37:06] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: you can also use CSS3 "transition" on the base thing
[22:37:11] <phonebook_> nm i dont care
[22:37:15] <ArtificialEX> anyone use markitup?
[22:37:18] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: and make it fade
[22:37:25] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: using :hover
[22:37:26] <binaryfus10nz> can you do CSS3 text fade?
[22:37:31] <phonebook_> except i do becuase its no point in me talking in here
[22:37:33] <binaryfus10nz> text color*
[22:37:39] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: CSS3 transitions can animate "color" - yes
[22:37:49] <phonebook_> also
[22:37:57] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: but
[22:37:59] <phonebook_> nn
[22:38:01] <phonebook_> nm
[22:38:01] <phonebook_> nm
[22:38:02] <binaryfus10nz> too bad only new chrome supports fading bg images
[22:38:13] <binaryfus10nz> CSS3 that is
[22:38:20] <phonebook_> dont ask me to fic your code ever again Tim
[22:38:26] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: as a side note --- I would suggest you use CSS3 instead of jQuery for that effect, yes, but I don't want you to leave without understanding WHY it broke,and how to fix it
[22:38:30] <phonebook_> you bastard
[22:38:43] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: also, that "image" could likely be represented as a css3 gradient :)
[22:38:47] <phonebook_> *fix...
[22:38:48] <binaryfus10nz> oh I get it... the ajax content loaded has no relation to the doc ready stuff
[22:39:07] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: so the ajax content isn't in the document when you search and bind to it
[22:39:14] <gnarf> the workaround, is to use "delegation"
[22:39:23] <gnarf> you bind an event on the container that is replaced using ajax
[22:39:42] <gnarf> like if you had $("#result-area").html( newContent );
[22:39:44] <phonebook_> html5
[22:39:49] <phonebook_> vs ajax
[22:39:53] <phonebook_> html5 vs ajax
[22:40:16] <phonebook_> no need?
[22:40:36] <phonebook_> if you can implement the server side
[22:40:40] <gnarf> you'd want $("#result-area").on( "mouseenter mouseleave", ".myFadingButton", function( event ) { $( this ).toggleClass( "hover", event.type === "mouseenter" ); });
[22:40:42] <phonebook_> which isnt hard in .net
[22:40:49] <tw2113> html5 vs ajax = different technologies and purposes
[22:40:54] <phonebook_> no
[22:40:57] <phonebook_> no tw
[22:41:01] <phonebook_> wrong again you fricking troll
[22:41:11] <phonebook_> they live together
[22:41:25] <binaryfus10nz> and thats done in doc ready or outside
[22:41:31] <tw2113> they go together really really well
[22:41:33] <phonebook_> who listens on the socket on an iis server?
[22:41:35] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: bind the "mouseenter" and "mouseleave" on the thing that stays in the DOM, and use the second argument to .on() to "delegate" it
[22:41:36] <tw2113> they are not the same f'n thing
[22:41:45] <gnarf> binaryfus10nz: doc ready, cuz #results-area has to be there already
[22:41:59] <gnarf> .on() btw is 1.7+
[22:42:04] <b-ot> gnarf, memorised “btw”.
[22:42:59] <phonebook_> how would you connect a jquery socket(such a thing???) to a sp.net server or a php server???
[22:43:05] <phonebook_> just a ~~~~~~~~~~
[22:43:16] <phonebook_> i will answer if you dont have any guess
[22:43:32] <gnarf> phonebook_: socket level communication from browser based javascript is not very easy
[22:43:50] <gnarf> there is however the websocket api http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket
[22:44:01] <phonebook_> by socket i meant a jquery wrapper
[22:44:15] <gnarf> ?!
[22:44:17] <phonebook_> $.socket
[22:44:19] <binaryfus10nz> either way thanks for the help gnarf
[22:44:25] <phonebook_> which should and will happehn
[22:44:51] <gnarf> phonebook_: why? websockets doesn't need a "jquery plugin" although I'm pretty sure someone has already written one
[22:44:57] <gnarf> ?g jquery websocket
[22:45:15] <gnarf> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-websocket/
[22:45:27] <gnarf> look at that
[22:46:14] <phonebook_> too much work
[22:46:47] <phonebook_> we got off track from what i cared about
[22:46:53] <phonebook_> and i will answer you
[22:47:12] <phonebook_> i dont want to dismiss you
[22:47:12] <phonebook_> ..or me..
[22:47:19] <phonebook_> sockets are needed to bring web pages into the future
[22:47:23] <phonebook_> the end
[22:47:25] <phonebook_> lol
[22:47:32] <gnarf> phonebook_: disagree
[22:47:46] <gnarf> phonebook_: HTTP protocol handles 90% of the use cases
[22:47:52] <phonebook_> ....i think artists and mathemeticians are needed to bring the internet into the future.. we ned 3d and art
[22:48:10] <gnarf> phonebook_: and all those people are already working here...
[22:48:26] <phonebook_> 90% sure.... but when we want to deliver content to people living not in the past...
[22:48:33] <phonebook_> the now is over
[22:48:41] <phonebook_> DateTime.Now.... is lame
[22:48:57] <phonebook_> it sucks and everyone in it doesnt get it
[22:49:31] <phonebook_> are you producing content to make money or to produce what is happening?
[22:49:37] <gnarf> phonebook_: there are also new methods for Date coming in ES6, but since we are web developers, and a lot of us still have to support IE6...
[22:49:40] <phonebook_> im talking shit right now
[22:50:13] <phonebook_> no one supports ie6
[22:50:29] <phonebook_> unless you work in a cubicle with 90% angles
[22:50:38] <phonebook_> i mean degree ascii
[22:50:58] <gnarf> phonebook_: the web evolves every day, if you've been even remotely aware of the progress it has made in the last 15 years you would agree, but I for some reason imagine that you might be younger than that...
[22:51:11] <phonebook_> my cubicle has radius angles to make me feel like less of a slave
[22:52:03] <phonebook_> im 50 years old!
[22:52:22] <gnarf> then stop acting like a teen in IRC please - thanks
[22:53:13] <phonebook_> maybe i have had too much to drink
[22:53:17] <phonebook_> possible
[22:53:18] <phonebook_> BUT
[22:53:20] <phonebook_> but but but
[22:53:22] <phonebook_> also
[22:53:29] <phonebook_> maybe im not stupid
[22:53:37] <phonebook_> its possible im not stupid
[22:53:50] <phonebook_> and i forget what my point was
[22:53:52] <phonebook_> so nm
[22:54:30] <gnarf> signal to noise... in the last 4 hours you've been responsible for very little, if any, constructive information - yet your name is starting >50% of the lines in my chat log
[22:54:39] <phonebook_> thats very lame
[22:54:44] <gnarf> yes, it is
[22:54:44] <phonebook_> and not impressive
[22:54:55] <gnarf> stop being lame
[22:54:56] <phonebook_> and i coudl writ ean algorithm like that too
[22:55:03] <phonebook_> yes, you shoud stop being lame
[22:55:04] <phonebook_> see
[22:55:29] <tw2113> this whole debate and bickering is kind of lame
[22:55:37] <phonebook_> agreed
[22:55:44] <phonebook_> BUT
[22:55:46] <gnarf> phonebook_: seriously? are you just poking buttons to see how long before I +q you?
[22:55:48] <phonebook_> not sorry
[22:55:49] <gnarf> STOP
[22:56:01] <phonebook_> because people should be allowed to speak.. vote for me
[22:56:03] <phonebook_> YOU STOP
[22:56:15] <phonebook_> yes
[22:56:18] <phonebook_> i am actually
[22:56:24] <phonebook_> i am analyzing you
[22:57:25] <pts\3> i'm using .live() so when you click something, it adds an element, and i need those added elements to also trigger the event. i read about delegation and bubbling but didn't really understand. can i make equivalent code using .on() or something? http://jsfiddle.net/T7fZV/
[22:57:53] <pts\3> or better yet, .one()
[22:58:58] <gnarf> pts\3: the heart of delegation is binding an event to a PARENT element of the things you want to catch
[22:59:03] <gnarf> "live" binds to the document
[22:59:07] <gnarf> its bad
[22:59:08] <gnarf> don't use it
[22:59:53] <gnarf> pts\3: so - bind an event on the "parent" of the <p> elements, something like $("#some-area").on("click", "p", function(){});
[23:01:04] <pts\3> thanks gnarf that made sense.  is http://jsfiddle.net/T7fZV/1/ right?
[23:01:24] <gnarf> pts\3: whats with the "span" part?
[23:01:41] <gnarf> pts\3: also, does it seem to work?
[23:02:08] <pts\3> my .live() exampled worked, but is "bad" so i'm trying to do what's "right" not what "works"
[23:02:20] <pts\3> the span is just a placeholder so i can prepend stuff to the end
[23:02:24] <pts\3> i really probably want to appendTo the div?
[23:02:37] <gnarf> pts\3: thats the proper use of the delegated event, yes
[23:03:43] <gnarf> pts\3: http://jsfiddle.net/T7fZV/2/
[23:03:53] <gnarf> pts\3: when possible - "cache" your selections
[23:04:16] <gnarf> there is no reason to ask jQuery to search the dom for "div" every time when you can just assign the result to a variable if it's not going to change
[23:04:18] <pts\3> oh that sounds like good coding practice
[23:05:01] <gnarf> pts\3: same with $(this) --- although that is relatively quick (since it has "this", and doesn't need to search the dom) it still has to call the function/create new objects/etc
[23:05:29] <gnarf> pts\3: if you see yourself using $(this) twice in one function, store it in a var
[23:05:43] <pts\3> thanks for the advice
[23:09:12] <codacoder> anyone around?
[23:09:20] <gnarf> codacoder: just ask ;)
[23:09:27] <codacoder> hey
[23:09:35] <codacoder> problem with detach()
[23:09:56] <codacoder> NOT taking .data("events") when I use it
[23:10:06] <gnarf> ?
[23:10:28] <gnarf> FYI - .data("events") is long deprecated - you shouldn't use it for any reason other than debugging
[23:10:34] <codacoder> docs say it's "deep" - but my debugging kinda proves i'm losing events
[23:11:04] <gnarf> codacoder: .detach() removes an element from the DOM tree, leaving all jQuery data cache intact
[23:11:16] <codacoder> yeah - thats what i'm doing - proving they're getting lost
[23:11:40] <codacoder> not true here - 1.7.2
[23:11:40] <gnarf> codacoder: jsfiddle.net ?
[23:11:56] <codacoder> tomorrow maybe - too tired right now
[23:12:06] <codacoder> was hoping someone might be here to confirm
[23:12:19] <gnarf> codacoder: i can confirm that you're wrong until you prove it in a test case on fiddle ;)
[23:12:50] <codacoder> lol - i'm a test eng too - that would be my response too!
[23:12:51] <gnarf> codacoder: we specifically unit test this ability, and 1.7.2 doesn't have any known issues related to .detach()
[23:13:03] <gnarf> codacoder: that I am aware of
[23:13:07] <codacoder> well that's great to hear
[23:13:36] <gnarf> codacoder: if you could show me the example case - i could tell you why most likely
[23:13:52] <gnarf> codacoder: most of the .data() code was last rewritten by me in 1.7
[23:13:53] <codacoder> check this line... parse this and let me know oif you see anything flakey
[23:14:08] <codacoder> var domReportTables = appFrameWin.$("#QTEReportTableWrapper").children().detach();
[23:14:26] <gnarf> codacoder: save for the potential cross frame issues? :)
[23:14:40] <gnarf> codacoder: cross-frame jQuery is tough...
[23:14:51] <codacoder> nah - works great
[23:15:00] <codacoder> this isnt working though
[23:15:15] <gnarf> codacoder: are you sure you're using the correct frames jQuery function to look at the data?
[23:15:25] <codacoder> trust me - i'm used to tought ;)
[23:15:32] <codacoder> *tough
[23:15:41] <codacoder> yep
[23:15:42] <gnarf> because if there are multiple copies of jQuery in multiple frames... each has its own data cache
[23:16:07] <codacoder> everything else is there - but not the events
[23:16:14] <codacoder> they're gone on detach
[23:16:15] <gnarf> codacoder: .data() doesn't include "events"
[23:16:33] <codacoder> no?  how do i check then?
[23:16:44] <gnarf> .data( "events" ) is a special case which digs into the "private data cache"
[23:16:55] <codacoder> hang on - i'll get the firebug watch
[23:17:04] <gnarf> jQuery._data( DOMElement )
[23:17:11] <gnarf> codacoder: ^^^ thats the private data cache
[23:17:33] <gnarf> and it has a key "data" that has the "public" data object
[23:17:34] <codacoder> $(domReportTables[0]).find("button").first().data("events") <= undefined
[23:18:01] <codacoder> also - specific button with id...
[23:18:16] <codacoder> $QTEC.appFrameWin.$("#info-button_1343453273027").data("events")
[23:18:28] <codacoder> again, undefined
[23:18:41] <codacoder> thing is, the data() works before the detach
[23:19:03] <gnarf> codacoder: and it isn't being .remove()'ed or replaced with .html() anywhere before the detach?
[23:19:11] <codacoder> nope
[23:19:16] <gnarf> or literally before running .detach() and after you see a change
[23:19:21] <gnarf> because that shouldn't happen
[23:19:32] <codacoder> i know it shouldnt happen
[23:19:38] <codacoder> but it is
[23:20:02] <codacoder> i will get it... i dont shy away from these things
[23:20:20] <gnarf> codacoder: hrm
[23:20:30] <gnarf> codacoder: console.log( jQuery.fn.remove )
[23:20:47] <gnarf> compare to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.7.2/src/manipulation.js#L168-183
[23:20:55] <gnarf> it hasn't been duck punched has it?
[23:21:41] <gnarf> "detach( selector )" calls .remove( selector, true )
[23:22:04] <codacoder> duck punched?  explain please
[23:22:29] <gnarf> codacoder: some plugin might of decided it needed an event on remove
[23:22:34] <gnarf> and overwrote jQuery.fn.remove
[23:22:48] <gnarf> and not implemented the "keepData" flag to pass through to the original function
[23:22:59] <gnarf> this could cause .detach() to not keep data object
[23:23:11] <gnarf> codacoder: also - you said the rest of the data object was intact?
[23:23:56] <codacoder> yeah - intact in that it looks completely fine
[23:24:05] <codacoder> no plugins
[23:24:20] <gnarf> codacoder: can you add jQuery._data( domelement ) to your watch?
[23:24:24] <codacoder> and by no plugins i means absolutely none whatsoever ;)
[23:25:14] <codacoder> so is my button (that lost the vents) the domelement to ad to that?
[23:25:36] <gnarf> yeah - element, not jQuery object ;)
[23:25:51] <codacoder> got it - sec...
[23:26:11] <gnarf> $QTEC.appFrameWin.$._data( $QTEC.appFrameWin.$("#info-button_1343453273027")[0] )
[23:27:06] <gnarf> codacoder: also - you should google "duck punching" :)
[23:27:17] <gnarf> http://paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/
[23:27:37] <jastor> reminds me of bonzi
[23:28:04] <codacoder> ok...
[23:28:25] <codacoder> firebug shows: data Object { }
[23:29:10] <gnarf> before ?
[23:29:14] <gnarf> after ?
[23:29:15] <gnarf> does it change?
[23:29:20] <gnarf> can you fold out the object?
[23:29:32] <codacoder> ah... that's a good question...
[23:29:38] * gnarf doesn't like firebug anymore ;)
[23:29:41] <codacoder> ok so this is AFTER .detach
[23:29:53] <gnarf> put a breakpoint on the .detach
[23:29:57] <codacoder> I'll need to rerun the cycle to get a before
[23:29:59] <gnarf> and look at a before/after
[23:30:04] <codacoder> k
[23:30:11] <codacoder> brb
[23:34:05] <codacoder> gnarf: jQuery._data(x[0]) => Object { }
[23:34:16] <codacoder> that'sa a before
[23:34:29] <gnarf> codacoder: if thats really empty, then there aren't actually any events on it at that point
[23:34:45] <gnarf> .data( "events" ) should reflect that too
[23:35:24] <codacoder> No?  then what's this: x.data("events")      Object { click=[1]}
[23:35:43] <gnarf> jQuery.fn === x.prototype
[23:35:44] <gnarf> ?
[23:35:59] <codacoder> w?
[23:36:11] <gnarf> is jQuery.fn === x.prototype
[23:36:20] <codacoder> .data says there are events
[23:36:27] <gnarf> otherwise your jQuery is not the jQuery that created and bound the event
[23:36:31] <codacoder> which is correct - there are!
[23:36:48] <codacoder> ah - sorry
[23:36:54] <codacoder> sec...
[23:37:36] <gnarf> and sorry
[23:37:41] <gnarf> x.__proto__ === jQuery.fn
[23:37:47] <gnarf> ^^^ thats the test
[23:38:02] <gnarf> dunno why i put .prototype instead of .__proto__ ;)
[23:40:04] <codacoder> yeah - i knew what you meant
[23:40:06] <codacoder> $QTEC.appFrameWin.jQuery.fn === x.__proto__        true
[23:40:30] <gnarf> so $QTEC.appFrameWin.jQuery._data( x[0] )
[23:41:09] <codacoder> Object { events={...}, data={...}, handle=function()}
[23:43:05] <gnarf> codacoder: so now, after x.detach() ?
[23:43:15] <gnarf> codacoder: http://jsfiddle.net/FVLJJ/21/
[23:44:42] <codacoder> $(domReportTables[0]).find("button").first().data("events")        undefined
[23:44:56] <codacoder> not much point ingoing any further - they're gone
[23:45:53] <gnarf> codacoder: what was the $QTEC.appFrameWin.jQuery._data( x[0] ) after the detach though?
[23:46:00] <trailbar> hilarious newbie question but from a jQuery() object how do i get the actual dom element?
[23:46:09] <gnarf> trailbar: its like an array
[23:46:12] <gnarf> [0] is the first match
[23:46:15] <codacoder> lemme reset x...
[23:46:34] <gnarf> trailbar: also, look at http://api.jquery.com/get
[23:46:57] <gnarf> trailbar: also, .each() passes each element as "this"
[23:47:10] <codacoder> $QTEC.appFrameWin.jQuery._data( x[0] )        TypeError: a is undefined
[23:47:21] <codacoder> not the first time i've seen this in 1.7.2
[23:47:46] <gnarf> codacoder: did you look at my fiddle?
[23:48:54] <gnarf> codacoder: cross-frame jQuery is dangerous, like i said ;)
[23:49:07] <trailbar> gnarf: ok, i'm probably misunderstanding something badly then (i am beginner to js, html AND jquery)... i want to get the same object that one would get from document.GetelementbyId("blah") -- after what you said i thought $("blah").get(0) but this does not appear to get the same result?
[23:49:08] <gnarf> codacoder: also, are you using minified jQuery in development?
[23:49:19] <gnarf> trailbar: $("#blah")[0]
[23:49:40] <gnarf> trailbar: $ takes a css selector, not an ID - "blah" is looking for any <blah> tags
[23:49:49] <codacoder> one thing at a time yeah looking at the fiddle
[23:50:17] <codacoder> the x-frame thing doesnt scare me - perhapsit should
[23:50:23] <codacoder> ;)
[23:51:01] <trailbar> gnarf: ouch, yes thanks!
[23:51:42] <gnarf> codacoder: it's likely that you are calling .data( "events" ) on a jQuery from the frame that isn't the jQuery that actually has the data for those events...
[23:52:01] <codacoder> got me thinking now... about sending dom fragments across the boundary
[23:52:18] <codacoder> no - we just proved they were the same
[23:52:42] <gnarf> once you have multiple jQuery objects floating around, it becomes very important to only inspect/modify these properties via that documents "jQuery" object
[23:52:57] <codacoder> isnt that what the __proto__test was about?
[23:53:08] <gnarf> codacoder: if you detach in one frame, then attach in another, it will lose events every time
[23:53:30] <codacoder> they're lost on detach() - not prepend
[23:53:43] <gnarf> my fiddle proves that isn't the case
[23:53:46] <gnarf> in 1.7.2
[23:54:04] <codacoder> no, your fiddle is a totally different context
[23:54:06] <gnarf> can you add a console.log() before and after the .detach() ?
[23:54:21] <codacoder> i can add it, sure
[23:55:03] <codacoder> time there?
[23:55:05] <gnarf> codacoder: I >highly< doubt that detach() could be removing the private data cache unless someone duck punched jQuery.fn.remove
[23:55:14] <flip_digits> does anyone know how to show the "exploded view" of the dom with chrome or firebug?
[23:55:27] <gnarf> codacoder: i used a timeout because chrome doesn't like to print the objects in console.log until the end of the frame
[23:55:43] <gnarf> codacoder: probably wasn't nessecary
[23:55:52] <codacoder> i got timeouts coming out my arse
[23:56:07] <codacoder> this is so async you wouldn't believe
[23:56:19] <codacoder> it's 2am here... I'm shagged
[23:56:24] <gnarf> codacoder: consider using deferreds ;)
[23:56:26] <gnarf> codacoder: same
[23:56:39] <codacoder> i do that too...
[23:56:39] <flip_digits> does anyone know how to show the "exploded view" of the dom with chrome or firebug?
[23:56:51] <gnarf> flip_digits: elements panel of chrome?
[23:56:54] <codacoder> and a sneaky way of getting yield via exceptions
[23:57:14] <flip_digits> @gnarf I'm not sure, but is that the 3d view?
[23:57:16] <b-ot> flip_digits, memorised “but”.
[23:57:22] <databack> exploded view of the dom meaning?
[23:57:24] <gnarf> 3d?
[23:57:55] <flip_digits> you can see the stacking order and can rotate the elements on the page
[23:57:58] <gnarf> flip_digits: i recall seeing something in a paul irish talk about 3d web inspection, but like i don't remember because I found it unexciting
[23:58:02] <codacoder> what times you around, gnarf?
[23:58:20] <databack> no idea why you'd want to see the DOM in 3D
[23:58:21] <gnarf> codacoder: depends on the day
[23:58:38] <codacoder> time there?
[23:58:47] <gnarf> codacoder: im in the same time zone :)
[23:58:50] <flip_digits> that's it 3d page inspection!
[23:58:52] <codacoder> we close to same time zone?
[23:58:58] <codacoder> ah - ok
[23:58:59] <gnarf> codacoder: Illinois
[23:59:04] <codacoder> AR
[23:59:07] <flip_digits> thanks for jarring my memory!
[23:59:40] <gnarf> databack: i could see it being handy for looking at stacking issues in really complex css layouts
[23:59:45] <databack> what advantage is there to looking at a page in 3D
