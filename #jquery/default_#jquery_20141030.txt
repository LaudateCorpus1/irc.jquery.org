[00:51:20] <lonejack> hello, I'm building a form using jquery ui widgets. Some fields (i.e. normal input text fields) are appearing in a different style respect to the widgets. To solve the problem I've applied a specific style to those fields(in order to have the same effect). Does it exist a more simple(and canonical) way to solve this question?
[01:09:58] <P0rk> lonejack, did you read the API documentation for Jquery UI. I think it's in there.
[01:18:27] <Solcero> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0e87aa61f547dabd7acc  hi, someone an idea why this snippet doesn't work in firefox ? nothing happens on click..
[01:23:56] <Cork> Solcero: the problem is most likely not in that code
[01:28:57] <Solcero> Cork: hmm ok - no error message in the console, you have an idea how to debug this?
[01:29:24] <Cork> Solcero: start by checking if the even handler fires
[01:36:00] <sergey> Hi. Please help me get work jquery validation http://jsfiddle.net/Graff/qexdc55w/ It works fine for button "Invest" (press "invest" button, then press another invest button in dialog) but for rest it works partially (if you press "Donate" button, then press another Donate button in dialog it will show wrong result)
[02:11:33] <BostonGeorge2k> hello, does anyone know a horizontal bar chart that increases from 0-100% in for example 5 seconds on loading ?
[02:11:48] <BostonGeorge2k> i can't find one with that kind of animation
[03:10:41] <davetarmac> what is the best way to do a switch statement with less/greater than cases?
[03:14:14] <mooncup> davetarmac: if() { } else {}
[03:14:36] <davetarmac> oh right, no way to do it in a switch?
[03:14:51] <mooncup> you can do it in a switch I think
[03:14:58] <mooncup> but google tells me it's slower
[03:15:05] <mooncup> and by google I mean stack overflow
[03:15:08] <mooncup> 1 sec, I'l llink it
[03:15:15] <mooncup> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6665997/switch-statement-for-greater-than-less-than
[03:15:50] <mooncup> in 2012 it was apparently 30 times slower
[03:15:56] <mooncup> dunno if anoyne has retested since then
[03:16:15] <Cork> no you can't do it with switch
[03:16:22] <Cork> switch only matches exact statements
[03:17:06] <Cork> what they do is basically use switch for if cases (that return true/false)
[03:17:28] <Cork> similar to (1 < 10) == true
[03:17:51] <davetarmac> nice one Cork, thanks
[03:18:00] <Cork> nice?
[03:18:09] <Cork> mooncup: gave the link
[03:18:19] <Cork> i just explained how that isn't really switch cases
[03:18:25] <davetarmac> and thanks mooncup - saw that article but missed the one about testing the condition in the first bit
[03:18:31] <davetarmac> sorry - I was typing :)

[03:32:16] <djam90> Hi. Is there any issue with having multiple $(function(){ .. code .. }   on a page?
[03:32:49] <DevAntoine> hi
[03:33:46] <DevAntoine> I don't understand what's happening with $(this) inside an event handler. It returns me the right tag, but not the same object as if I would have selected it using a classic selector
[03:35:05] <P0rk> DevAntoine, how long is a piece of string?
[03:35:29] <DevAntoine> P0rk: what???
[03:35:44] <P0rk> There are a million possible answers to your question. Just like the string question. we need more info.
[03:36:10] <djam90> Hi. Is there any issue with having multiple $(function(){ .. code .. }   on a page?
[03:37:29] <P0rk> djam90, I don't think it's a problem. If you load a couple different scripts, they each have one, so I don't think its' an issue.
[03:39:42] <Cork> you can have multiple ready handlers
[03:39:45] <Cork> no problem there
[03:41:17] <Cork> DevAntoine: $() creates a new object
[03:41:37] <Cork> every time it is called, so yes it is expected tnat $('selector') != $(this)
[03:41:45] <Cork> *that
[03:41:49] <DevAntoine> P0rk, Cork: the thing is: I can't reproduce it in jsfiddle oO Digging
[03:42:11] <Cork> $('selector')[0] === this though
[03:42:39] <Erwat> hey Cork have you used some kind of a testing framework like jasmine or selenium?
[03:42:59] <Cork> i've used selenium a bit
[03:43:05] <Cork> never looked at jasmine
[03:43:15] <Erwat> when i write a unit test for a function should i differentiate each call of the function into a separate test?
[03:43:26] <Cork> also looked at (but never use) jqunit
[03:43:28] <Erwat> or could i just go through a whole array of possible inputs and expected outputs in that one test
[03:43:51] <Cork> Erwat: it depends very much on the framework
[03:44:16] <Cork> different testing frameworks has different practices for this
[03:44:34] <Erwat> i just think that if 'm gonna have like 5 to 6 tests for a function and like maybe 10 functions in the module (not all of them will have this kind of coverage but some might) i'd be loading the module file like 60 times to cover all of them
[03:45:48] <Cork> Erwat: ya, that is a limitation in some testing frameworks
[03:46:05] <Cork> and why some allow testing multiple things per test
[03:46:44] <Cork> Erwat: but loading the object a new over and over again is a good thing in some cases
[03:47:03] <Cork> cause that means you don't get inter test pollutions
[03:47:03] <Erwat> i guess, it eliminates global state issues
[03:47:20] <Cork> and those can be horrible for test accuracy
[03:48:03] <Cork> so having strong boundaries separating each test is often a good thing
[03:48:18] <Cork> as long as the running time isn't extended too much
[03:49:13] <Erwat> well, as an example i'm testing a function which makes text into camel case if it's written a certain way eg "foo-bar" -> "fooBar"
[03:53:00] <Erwat> this is trivial but will serve as an example for others later
[04:02:03] <J_______> Fellas I have a question. There are multiple elements all with the same measurements sorted in a grid. I need to trigger a function if the first clicked element and second element's Y positions differ more than the height of the element. Exmp If element A's Y position = (element B's Y Position + or - element A.height) {//do stuff}
[04:05:44] <Cork> J_______: it is prob simpler to just check the x position of the element
[04:05:53] <Cork> and find the first element that way
[04:06:11] <Cork> either way you get it from .position()
[04:06:35] <J_______> Well you see it's a function that should only trigger if the first clicked one is on a different row then the last
[04:06:48] <J_______> That's why I'm looking for the Y
[04:08:26] <J_______> But since the elements ain't actually seperated in rows because responsive things
[04:08:38] <J_______> I gotta measure it ya see
[04:09:30] <Cork> J_______: ya i see, and i did answer your question
[04:10:18] <neredsenvy> I have multiple <line ct:value="soemthing"></line> elements in my charts. I want to bind on click event to all of them that will output ct:value out to console log. I tried $('line') calling it in document.ready however this does not work.
[04:10:23] <neredsenvy> What am I missing here
[04:11:46] <Teddy> hey guys can someone give me a small hand
[04:11:58] <Cork> neredsenvy: make sure you call it in the svg document
[04:12:05] <Cork> neredsenvy: you can't make selections cross documents
[04:12:15] <Cork> ?ask @ Teddy
[04:12:15] <b-ot> Teddy: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:12:33] <neredsenvy> Cork, I have no SVG element just js and ccss
[04:13:04] <neredsenvy> Well I have a .map file
[04:13:38] <Teddy> anyone got any idea why the php file is not receiving this ajax request
[04:13:39] <Teddy> http://pastebin.com/btTTk2Z2
[04:20:53] <Cork> neredsenvy: <line> isn't an html tag
[04:20:58] <Cork> so you can't have it in html
[04:21:10] <Cork> meaning you have to have an svg document
[04:27:49] <Teddy> anyone know if this ajax request is fine ? http://pastebin.com/btTTk2Z2
[04:28:05] <Teddy> for some reason it's not working
[04:29:34] <Cork> Teddy: use serializeArray instead of serialize if you need to add your own data
[04:30:24] <Cork> then $.extend() it with an [{ name:, value: }] pair
[04:30:41] <Teddy> Cork, i'm trying to send a delete request to php script
[04:30:53] <Teddy> i have a list and i need to delete it's record
[04:31:08] <Cork> Teddy: my point is don't concat the string in the handler
[04:31:14] <Cork> it is very error prone
[04:31:48] <Teddy> Cork, you think that's why it's just redirecting me to the php page rather than sending the request
[04:32:09] <Cork> it is most likely cause of script errors
[04:32:48] <Cork> Teddy: http://pastebin.com/8VqQFArB
[04:33:12] <Cork> Teddy: also user event.preventDefault() instead of return false;
[04:33:21] <Cork> (at the beginning of the handler
[04:33:23] <Cork> )
[04:33:55] <Teddy> Cork, that looks better but it dosne't seem to be the problem, the ajax is still not executing
[04:34:11] <Cork> Teddy: look in your console for the error
[04:34:59] <Teddy> Cork, i get to errors there
[04:36:26] <Teddy> Cork, this is the entire js file
[04:36:30] <Teddy> Cork, http://pastebin.com/ufK46Ay2
[04:36:38] <Cork> please don't use pastebin
[04:36:40] <Cork> ?paste
[04:36:41] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:36:54] <Teddy> Cork, got it
[04:38:12] <Teddy> Cork, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b3789372f12122a2431d
[04:38:18] <Cork> ...
[04:38:20] <Cork> ?paste
[04:38:20] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:38:25] <Cork> ^^^^^^^^^
[04:38:59] <Cork> Teddy: gist and pastebin has the same problem
[04:39:03] <Teddy> Cork, sorry http://jsfiddle.net/gab69rgo/
[04:39:11] <Cork> they are very hard to give a correction back to the one asking the question
[04:39:52] <Teddy> Cork, i'm aware of security holes and other drawbacks of that code but i'm just trying it to get to work for now
[04:39:57] <Cork> Teddy: what does console.log($(".js-ajax-php-json").length) if you run it before the submit handler?
[04:41:42] <tyteen4a03> is there a jquery plugin that wraps around the YouTube player API?
[04:42:12] <Teddy> Cork, i see nothing
[04:42:39] <Cork> Teddy: it you don't get an output in the console?
[04:42:56] <Teddy> Cork, nop. no autput at all
[04:43:24] <Cork> so the code doesn't run at all for you
[04:43:33] <Cork> you ran it BEFORE the .submit line right?
[04:43:39] <Teddy> Cork, yep
[04:43:47] <Cork> then your script isn't loading at all
[04:43:53] <Cork> also http://jsfiddle.net/gab69rgo/1/
[04:44:03] <Teddy> Cork, sorry
[04:44:10] <Teddy> Cork, eddited it
[04:44:14] <Teddy> Cork, returns 1
[04:44:23] <Cork> ok
[04:44:33] <Cork> try reproduce the fixes i have added in the fiddle
[04:44:40] <Cork> and see if that makes a difference
[04:45:10] <Teddy> Cork, all behaves the same :p
[04:45:33] <Cork> Teddy: and ify ou put a console.log() after event.preventDefault() it fires?
[04:47:29] <Teddy> Cork, i've put one after each event.preventDefault() but i get nothing in the console
[04:47:47] <Cork> ok
[04:48:03] <Cork> what what most likely happens is that there is another event handler binding to these elements
[04:48:13] <Cork> and they do like this code return false;
[04:48:20] <Cork> making it impossible for you to handle the event
[04:48:43] <Cork> only way to get around this is to find the handler and replace the return false; call
[04:49:03] <Teddy> Cork, ..i could give you a link to the page....
[04:49:18] <Cork> i don't have the time to shift through the page in hunt for the line
[04:49:25] <Cork> you will have to do the legwork
[04:49:46] <Teddy> Cork, fair play, thanks for the help
[04:49:52] <Cork> good luck
[04:51:51] <wfq> Hi guys
[04:55:33] <sergey> Please help me get work jquery validation http://jsfiddle.net/Graff/qexdc55w/ It works fine for button "Invest" (press "invest" button, then press another invest button in dialog) but for rest it works partially (if you press "Donate" button, then press another Donate button in dialog it will show wrong result)
[05:21:11] <PhonicUK> is there a way to make .fadeIn() always have the equivelent of .css("display", "") when run so that it always uses the default display style set in my CSS?
[05:21:25] <Mark_____> what’s the difference between the jquery and angularjs?
[05:21:25] <PhonicUK> otherwise you either end up with it being set to block, or you have to do .fadeIn().css(...) every time
[05:21:53] <PhonicUK> the same as apples to oranges, they do different jobs
[05:22:15] <Mark_____> so, which one is better?
[05:22:21] <Mark_____> or advanced?
[05:22:35] <PhonicUK> neither is better, they do different jobs...
[05:22:39] <Mark_____> okay..
[05:23:03] <PhonicUK> Angular makes it easier to do MVVM an certain types of data-driven design
[05:23:13] <Cork> PhonicUK: just run .hide() on the element and it should work fine
[05:23:24] <Cork> .hide() stores the old display: value
[05:23:34] <Cork> and .fadeIn uses this
[05:24:07] <PhonicUK> Cork, interesting I suppose I could override the .fadeIn method to do this for me
[05:24:25] <Cork> PhonicUK: uh no it isn't fadeIn that should do it
[05:24:43] <Cork> PhonicUK: it is what ever hides it that needs to use .hide() instead
[05:24:55] <PhonicUK> it's hidden via CSS
[05:25:05] <Cork> ya, and that's the problem
[05:25:13] <Cork> run .hide() on ready instead
[05:25:19] <PhonicUK> mm, okay
[05:38:07] <neredsenvy> What am I doing wrong here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9c5948f4e3edc6375d9b I'm trying to check each option element of select tag and if it's value matches month number I want to add selected tag to it.
[05:38:22] <neredsenvy> sorry wrong code
[05:38:55] <neredsenvy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c37944fe98598a5261c2 This is the correct one
[05:39:58] <Cork> neredsenvy: don't add selected with attr
[05:40:13] <neredsenvy> how then ?
[05:40:29] <Cork> basically only use attr if you want the raw unhandled html attribute string
[05:40:38] <Cork> .prop('selected', true/false)
[05:40:51] <Cork> also you might want to use .filter instead
[05:41:32] <neredsenvy> got it to work now
[05:41:33] <neredsenvy> ty
[05:42:07] <Cork> neredsenvy: http://jsfiddle.net/b2qnkxcb/
[05:42:38] <neredsenvy> However d = new Date(); n = d.getMonth() returns a wrong month : / returns September instead of October
[05:42:38] <Cork> or just http://jsfiddle.net/b2qnkxcb/1/
[05:42:53] <Cork> neredsenvy: getMonth is zero based
[05:42:58] <Cork> so 0 == jan
[05:43:02] <neredsenvy> Ah so I need to add +1
[05:43:03] <neredsenvy> ty
[05:43:26] <Cork> neredsenvy: but check the fiddle
[05:43:43] <Cork> it removes the creation of the date value over and over again too
[05:44:31] <Cork> neredsenvy: another option is this http://jsfiddle.net/b2qnkxcb/2/
[06:04:17] <Kirito> $(".episodes-button").text(selectedOption.toString() + '<span class="caret"></span>'); // how can I do this so that jQuery doesn't html entity encode the span?
[06:05:07] <xec> .html() instead of .text()
[06:05:24] <Kirito> Awesome, thanks
[06:06:36] <Cork> maan captcha is becomming silly...
[06:06:40] <Cork> http://oi60.tinypic.com/264j72d.jpg
[06:06:51] <Cork> how is anyone suppose to read that??
[06:06:52] <xec> lol
[06:07:17] <xec> easy. it obviously wants you to type "camouflage"
[06:08:30] <BillCriswell> I'm not human. Shit.
[06:09:22] <xec> you need a robot to decipher it. ah the irony
[06:11:42] <hendr1x> I don't understand why this code works.  Specifically how the var formElementType (line #8) is retained with an async request : [ http://pastebin.com/eRwWePA4 ] Can someone explain it to me?
[06:12:17] <BillCriswell> I propose a ban on pastebin.com
[06:12:26] <Cork> ya, me too
[06:12:26] <BillCriswell> hendr1x: Nothing personal hendr1x. =)
[06:12:40] <Cork> hendr1x: simple, the variable isn't declared
[06:12:43] <Cork> so it is global
[06:12:53] <xec> it's an argument
[06:12:55] <Cork> oh, wait it's an argument -_-'
[06:12:57] <Cork> ya
[06:12:59] <Cork> missed that
[06:13:03] <BillCriswell> http://pastie.org/pastes/9685454/text
[06:13:04] <hendr1x> lol....... http://jsfiddle.net/m4ncg3va/
[06:13:24] <Cork> hendr1x: so the variable is just inherited through the scopes
[06:13:25] <xec> hendr1x: it is stored in the inner function's closure
[06:13:27] <hendr1x> :) that ad is riducious
[06:14:06] <BillCriswell> hendr1x: Yeah, only reason I said it. It always seems to be the goto paste thing too.
[06:14:25] <hendr1x> I thought the response of an ajax query was a new thread?
[06:14:33] <Cork> BillCriswell: most likely for the same reason ppl go to w3schools
[06:14:34] <xec> js is single threaded
[06:14:42] <BillCriswell> Damn googles.
[06:15:04] <Cork> unless you use workers
[06:15:52] <hendr1x> wouldn't that imply that it would run through the function formElementPopup...then on the completion of the async request done() would be out of scope and the var wouldn't be assigned?
[06:16:14] <Cork> hendr1x: no cause the scope is merged by the browser
[06:16:15] <xec> hendr1x: why would its scope change?
[06:16:28] <Cork> when you create a new function
[06:16:38] <Cork> it inherits all the variables accessable in the parent scope
[06:16:48] <Cork> so the function keeps these alive
[06:16:49] <crashworks> Everything jquery on my site broke.  I'm on Wordpress using 1.11.1.11.11.1 and jquery-migrate.
[06:16:49] <crashworks> I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function " in jquery.js on Chrome and "TypeError: m.easing[this.easing] is not a function" in FF
[06:17:10] <BillCriswell> That is a hell of a version number.

[06:18:33] <Cork> it is

[06:18:37] <Cork> needed i mean

[06:38:00] <zumba_addict> morning folks. I'm experiment on a code that I found. It calls document.querySelector('#chart-services'); So I created <div id="chart-services"></div> Unfortunately, it's returning null. What am I doing wrong?
[06:38:31] <Cork> zumba_addict: most likely the selector runs before the element exists
[06:38:39] <zumba_addict> ah
[06:38:49] <zumba_addict> i remember now.
[06:39:13] <zumba_addict> i'll try to move the script before </body> or maybe document.ready it
[06:40:02] <zumba_addict> it works now, not  null anymore :)

[06:47:46] <Aias> hi. does anyone use the jquery 'datepicker'? i'm having a little trouble putting dates inital dates in the input box (i.e. values looked up from database that input defaults to when page loads)
[06:48:36] <Aias> i use the same format that datepicker is set to...
[06:51:48] <Aias> basically, a value defined in html: value="01/01/70", does not show when datepicker is implemented and the input tag contains its id (id="datepicker")
[06:52:29] <norc_> Hi. I have an AJAX call that returns a JSON object. Can I simply pass the entire JSON object as a parameter to another AJAX call?
[06:52:54] <Cork> norc_: you would have to encode the json object
[06:53:09] <Cork> else it would be converted to params in the new request
[06:53:36] <norc_> Cork: That would work. I just need the data that structure to be passed.
[06:53:42] <shoky> Aias: seems fine  http://jsfiddle.net/z8tx5s3b/
[06:54:56] <Cork> norc_: then sure, works fine
[06:55:04] <norc_> Cork: Thank you then. :)
[06:55:34] <norc_> so that would be just: dataType: 'json', data: myJsonObject  ?
[06:55:45] <Cork> no
[06:55:57] <Cork> dataType is what type of data you want to request from the server
[06:56:14] <Cork> it has absolutely no impact on your pushed data
[06:56:52] <norc_> Ohh, I actually feel silly now.
[07:06:32] <Superhans> Hi... would it be possible to put both these into the same click-handler and then decide where to scroll by using 'this' or something similair? New to JS and jquery alltogether.. http://jsfiddle.net/hv0yzpet/
[07:09:25] <sacho> Superhans, sure, `this` in an event handler is set to the `event.currentTarget`, which is the current DOM object along the bubbling phase that the event is triggered against
[07:09:53] <sacho> so you could just wrap it in a jquery object -> $(this).offset()...
[07:11:29] <Superhans> sacho: yea i was thinking/trying something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/hv0yzpet/2/
[07:11:50] <sacho> that's not really the same thing.
[07:11:53] <Superhans> but i get the feeling something is missing, for it to know where i should be taken
[07:12:18] <sacho> $('#this') selects an element with the id "this".
[07:12:35] <sacho> $(this) wraps the object `this`(which already contains a DOM element) in a jquery object.
[07:13:04] <sacho> Superhans, http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[07:13:24] <Superhans> Ah yea, so without the #
[07:14:27] <Superhans> I'll read that, thanks
[07:14:38] <mikehaas763_> Does jquery.get() detect IE and prepend the href from <base> to relative path requests?
[07:15:53] <BillCriswell> mikehaas763_: How are you giving it the url?
[07:16:11] <BillCriswell> If you give it a string I can't imagine it doing that. If you're reading the prop off a form element I don't see why not.
[07:16:34] <mikehaas763_> $.get('items')
[07:17:11] <BillCriswell> I don't believe it would... easy to find out, though.
[07:20:14] <BillCriswell> mikehaas763_: http://jsbin.com/lihusobuxu/1/edit?html,js,output doesn't appear so.
[07:21:01] <mikehaas763_> BillCriswell, ok I'll have to investigate more
[07:23:00] <nerder> hello
[07:27:21] <nerder> http://pastebin.com/YDiR9bkr i have a problem with this
[07:27:43] <nerder> i dnt get why $ is undefined if jquery is included properly
[07:28:36] <Cork> nerder: check so the resource is actually loaded
[07:30:43] <nerder> Cork: yes looks like everything is loaded
[07:31:12] <Cork> hard to tell then
[07:31:23] <Cork> might be running noConflict somewhere?
[07:33:02] <nerder> not i'm my code for sure, could be possible in any lib like bootstrap.js or angular?
[07:38:35] <J____> Hi, I'm sorry to be a bother but I have a rather interesting problem. You see I am trying to determine the amount of space between the bottom an element and the bottom of my window, but http://jsfiddle.net/44qp1jjd/1/ just isn't working it seems.
[07:43:46] <shoky> J____: window.height and div.height are undefined
[07:45:21] <shoky> J____: http://jsfiddle.net/44qp1jjd/5/
[07:45:32] <Aias> shoky: that does seem to work fine (jquery/datepicker). i'll fiddle with mine a little more
[07:45:35] <Aias> thanks
[07:47:06] <J____> shoky: Yea I just noticed and was fixing that! Tyvm
[07:50:02] <nerder> this is the only page that i have i'm using CND just to make sure that even you can check, what is the error in this 2 line jquery code?
[07:50:02] <nerder> http://pastebin.com/JvxwveF5
[07:53:09] <jnhghy> is there a way for me to set focus to a jquery-ui combobox ?
[07:53:43] <norc_> I have an ajax call, how do I specify an existing function, but pass an extra argument to it?
[07:53:51] <norc_> (For the success callback I mean)
[07:53:55] <xec> i didn't know there was a jquery ui combobox
[07:54:01] <shoky> nerder: mm you're not including the datetimepicker ?
[07:54:42] <nerder> shoky: what do you mean?
[07:54:46] <pablovilas> Hello everyone, I'm migrating the datatable plugin for jquery to the new api. anyone has experience on it?
[07:54:54] <shoky> nerder: i mean, you're not including the datetimepicker plugin, i think..
[07:55:37] <nerder> but bootstrap.js dnt have this kind of thing by himself?
[07:55:48] <shoky> nerder: i don't think so
[07:59:12] <varchar> norc_, pass your callback to an anonymous function, then pass parameters to the inner function.
[08:01:11] <Xatenev> Heya
[08:01:18] <Xatenev> I have a lot of filters
[08:01:24] <Xatenev> with like 50 checkboxes
[08:01:33] <Xatenev> when i click a checkbox, its value should be displayed in another list on the same page instantly
[08:01:38] <Xatenev> could anybody give me an approach to this?
[08:01:43] <Xatenev> should I be using an event listener here?
[08:02:54] <xec> do you mean clicked or checked (like, should unchecking it remove it from the list?)
[08:03:10] <Xatenev> unchecking should rmeove it again
[08:03:11] <Xatenev> remove*
[08:03:22] <Xatenev> so the list should always show exactly what checkboxes are clicked
[08:03:27] <Xatenev> purpose: all checkboxes are inside a dropdown
[08:03:33] <Xatenev> so u dont see what checkboxes are checked without that list
[08:04:53] <xec> Xatenev: there are a couple of ways to do this, but the easiest might be to always have all the filter names in the DOM and toggle their display
[08:05:04] <Xatenev> Yea i thought about this
[08:05:07] <Xatenev> but that site is alrdy soo big
[08:05:16] <Xatenev> I dont wanna fuck performance completly toh
[08:05:17] <Xatenev> tho
[08:05:53] <Xatenev> But I would pick that way if there is no other way
[08:10:25] <xec> Xatenev: another way is on check, add an element, and on uncheck see if there is a matching node and remove it
[08:11:13] <Xatenev> That seems to be a good way
[08:11:16] <Xatenev> So I use an event listener here
[08:12:33] <xec> Xatenev: this sort of thing gets a lot easier if you use a mvvm lib like knockout.js - you can have an array of filter items represented two places and just let the lib keep the view in sync
[08:12:35] <Aias> shoky: i took your jsfiddle and applied the difference between it and my code. and now the value="01/01/70" is not shown. please could you take a look when you have some seconds spare?
[08:13:00] <Aias> oh, it's http://jsfiddle.net/z8tx5s3b/7/
[08:13:32] <Aias> it seems that when dateFormat is used with datepicker, then the problem occurs
[08:13:47] <Aias> if anyone else cares to look, please do
[08:15:40] <Xatenev> xec: can i access $(this) inside the event?
[08:15:52] <Xatenev> like i call function showFilterInList
[08:15:58] <Xatenev> and refer to $(this) ?
[08:16:07] <xec> Xatenev: what event? show your code
[08:16:43] <Xatenev> example: checkboxesRegion[a].addEventListener('change', showFilterInList);
[08:17:08] <Xatenev> Now i wanna show the element on which this event got called
[08:17:13] <Xatenev> inside my list
[08:17:16] <Xatenev> where i wanna show all checkbxoes
[08:17:21] <Xatenev> all checkbox values
[08:17:26] <Xatenev> so i need $(this)
[08:17:31] <Xatenev> or the element from where the event got called
[08:18:01] <shoky> Aias: http://jsfiddle.net/z8tx5s3b/18/
[08:19:42] <xec> Xatenev: yes 'this' should be the element clicked in the showFilterInList function, or you can use the 'target' propery of the event object (first param) passed to it
[08:20:07] <Xatenev> So i just use $(this)
[08:20:16] <Aias> see, my javascript knowledge is less than basic. thank you! shoky.
[08:20:21] <Xatenev> *trying*
[08:20:38] <Xatenev> yea tru eworks great
[08:21:37] <Xatenev> Lets c if I manage to display it :p
[08:21:59] <xec> Xatenev: http://jsfiddle.net/zs8crasm/
[08:27:55] <mylord> how can i call this? (function($){ $.fn.resizecrop = function(options) {  …
[08:28:26] <mylord> I see an example: $('img').resizecrop( … but what is ‘img’?
[08:28:33] <mylord> does it have to be a DOM element?
[08:28:40] <mylord> I just have the filepath of my jpg
[08:29:11] <xec> dear mylord, you can't access the local file system from js in a browser
[08:29:28] <mylord> this is a cordova webapp.. i still can't?
[08:29:55] <xec> good question, i dunno
[08:30:04] <xec> but i doubt that plugin is made for it
[08:30:07] <mylord> xec: how can i crop an image from just image data?
[08:30:21] <mylord> i can’t find a js library for that
[08:30:38] <xec> mylord: you could smack the image data into an <img> element using base64
[08:30:55] <mylord> xec, how exactly?
[08:31:12] <mylord> and then, how would i crop it after its base64?
[08:31:33] <mylord> err.. nvm.. ok, so after its a DOM element, I could crop it.. but how do I “smack” it? :)
[08:31:35] <xec> what does that plugin do exactly?
[08:31:55] <mylord> it’s this one : https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera
[08:31:55] <xec> mylord: googled "smacking" for you, got http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1207190
[08:32:53] <mylord> xec: would this work, given that the image data file is at file:///storage/emulated/…
[08:33:59] <xec> mylord: i couldn't find "resizecrop" at that repository
[08:34:13] <mylord> xec, so you mean, i should add a DOM img, and then crop it?
[08:34:31] <mylord> but will there be a flicker? from before and after cropping?
[08:34:51] <mylord> xec: in that repo, it’s performCrop
[08:34:58] <xec> mylord: depends on what the plugin really does, the way i've done cropping is send coordinates to a server that does the cropping for me
[08:35:09] <Xatenev> How can I display th ekey?
[08:35:14] <Xatenev> like I got the checkbox
[08:35:17] <Xatenev> $('#checkbox')
[08:35:18] <mylord> but that calls the OS via intent for user to crop, and I just need it to crop to a perfect square, and not allow any user non-squares
[08:35:23] <Xatenev> Now it has a value and a key (label)
[08:35:26] <Xatenev> can I get the label somehow?
[08:35:54] <mylord> xec, but i mean, after i “smack” the base64 image into a DOM element, where will that dom element sit?
[08:35:58] <xec> Xatenev: not directly, but you could do $('label[for="checkbox"]')
[08:35:59] <mylord> inside the page DOM?
[08:36:10] <mylord> in that case, it will be visible before cropping for some time?
[08:36:12] <Xatenev> I just got $(this)
[08:36:21] <mylord> or do I put it into somewhere outside the page DOM?
[08:36:31] <Xatenev> $('label[for=this]') ?
[08:36:32] <decx> send base64 in a canvas and crop there, output new bse64
[08:36:44] <xec> mylord: you could have an off-dom element (use document.createElement() and just don't attach it to anything)
[08:37:06] <xec> Xatenev: where "checkbox" would be the ID
[08:37:07] <mylord> xec, awesome! trying
[08:37:24] <Xatenev> can i make $(this).id? ^^
[08:37:28] <xec> mylord: or with jquery just $("<img>") will create an element
[08:37:40] <xec> Xatenev: just this.id should do it, but you need to concat
[08:37:48] <Xatenev> using this now
[08:37:48] <Xatenev> var obj = $(this);
[08:37:48] <Xatenev> console.log($('label[for="'+obj.id+'"]'));
[08:37:59] <mylord> xec, so I do $("<img>") = filepath? or what?
[08:37:59] <Xatenev> and it absolutely does not work
[08:38:00] <Xatenev> xD
[08:38:28] <xec> mylord: no you'd have to create a base64 encoded string and set it as the src
[08:38:43] <xec> Xatenev: then do this.id instead
[08:38:48] <Xatenev> doesnt owrk aswlel
[08:38:49] <Xatenev> tried
[08:39:04] <Xatenev> or wait maybe now
[08:39:16] <xec> Xatenev: it should, try making a demo
[08:39:18] <mylord> xec, so this? $("<img>").src = imageData;
[08:39:21] <Xatenev> its undefined .(
[08:39:29] <Xatenev> when i make .val()
[08:39:40] <Xatenev> without val i get an empty obj
[08:39:49] <xec> mylord: no, more like $("<img>", { src: imageDataString })
[08:39:49] <Xatenev> selector"label[for="companyfilter-regionId-9"]"
[08:40:16] <xec> mylord: or $("<img>").attr("src", imageDataString)
[08:41:00] <xec> mylord: or  $('<img src="">')
[08:41:12] <xec> $('<img src="'+imageDataString+'">')
[08:41:18] <xec> which i'm not sure is a good idea
[08:41:39] <TeddyMurray> isnt it simply $("img") ?not <> ?
[08:41:45] <TeddyMurray> i dont nkow, really asking
[08:41:58] <xec> Teddy: for selecting yes, "<img>" creates a new element
[08:42:05] <TeddyMurray> ohhh nice
[08:42:13] <mylord> $('<img src='+imageData+'>');
[08:42:16] <mylord> sec?
[08:42:24] <mylord> imageData is just base64
[08:42:47] <mylord> xec, then? ('img').resizecrop({
[08:42:57] <xec> mylord: then you need to put the ceremony code thing first, like "data:image/png;base64," + imageData
[08:43:52] <xec> mylord: more like just call it on the object you just made, $("<img>", { src: imageString }).resizecrop(...)
[08:44:07] <xec> mylord: depending *entirely* on what .resizecrop() really does
[08:44:08] <mylord> xec, i’m trying to call this resize function: https://code.google.com/p/resize-crop/
[08:45:27] <robertmaxrees> that's an old plugin.
[08:45:37] <Xatenev> I think i found the error
[08:45:44] <xec> mylord: well... that doesnt actually really crop. or resize.
[08:46:12] <xec> mylord: it puts images where they don't fit and hide overflow, basically
[08:46:28] <mylord> xec: no? ok, how can i resize to square then?
[08:46:35] <jerry_____> How many Ajax calls are too many?
[08:46:37] <Xatenev> xec: i got al abel object now
[08:46:41] <Xatenev> How do I access just the text of it?
[08:46:58] <Xatenev> console.log($('label[for="'+this.id+'"]').val()); is empty
[08:47:03] <Xatenev> Tho i got a label objet iwthout .val()
[08:47:06] <xec> .text()
[08:47:06] <b-ot> xec: usually nicer
[08:47:11] <mylord> xec: i have this: https://gist.github.com/adaptivedev/1af73244f1030d09e0bf
[08:47:22] <xec> lol b-ot
[08:47:32] <Xatenev> xec: ur my hero
[08:47:32] <Xatenev> xD
[08:47:35] <Xatenev> ty:)
[08:48:49] <xec> mylord: ok you need to stop pasting my code and try to understand what i'm saying ;) that code in your pastie there will create two separate image elements and discard them both
[08:49:19] <mylord> xec: ok, do you have any suggestions on how i can crop my image to a square?
[08:49:39] <xec> mylord: basically $("<img>") will create a new element and return it, so if you want to do something with it you can use the chain or save it to a var
[08:50:25] <mylord> xec: most resize js libs i’ve seen perform “crop” on what seem to be DOM elements.
[08:50:38] <mylord> if I put as a var, should i still be able to use such crop libs?
[08:50:43] <xec> mylord: i honestly don't know if it can be done. in a browser i would say probably you can't, not without some fancy canvas trick or something - cordova i have no idea about
[08:52:44] <xec> mylord: have you seen this? https://github.com/skilesare/PhoneGap-Image-Resizer
[08:53:07] <robertmaxrees> mylord btw - https://github.com/karacas/imgLiquid
[08:53:47] <xec> robertmaxrees: if you look at the demo https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6983010/wserv/imgLiquid/examples/imgLiquid.html
[08:54:05] <robertmaxrees> mylord the maintainer of the library you linked points to the one i just referenced.
[08:54:11] <xec> robertmaxrees: you can inspect the images and see that they are not actually resized or cropped at all
[08:54:29] <robertmaxrees> if you want "real" cropping/resizing, do that server side.
[08:54:33] <duce1nik> what is the best way  to reload/refresh a page?  I'm using location.realod();  the problem is first call a function to iterate thru checkbox and delete,. but then location.reload() is call before it first so only the first checkbox is delete
[08:54:46] <xec> robertmaxrees: it's a cordova app
[08:54:48] <robertmaxrees> (I was late to the party so i'm not sure what all is going on)
[08:55:16] <duce1nik> before the itereation is finish
[08:55:19] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ duce1nik
[08:55:19] <b-ot> duce1nik: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:57:00] <mylord> xec, regarding the phonegap plugin, do you think, from the example there, that I must use getElementById?
[08:57:31] <mylord> from the android camera plugin, i just have the base64 data.. no DOM, not elementById, etc..
[08:57:47] <robertmaxrees> you can insert that into the DOM.
[08:57:53] <mylord> so.. should i create a temp DOM element etc like discussed before?
[08:58:00] <duckxx> im on win 7 ... how do you guys go about testing on ie8 ? right now i have ie11 installed
[08:58:14] <decx> go to http://modern.ie/
[08:58:17] <xec> mylord: yeah looks like it from the example on the start page there: image.src = "data:image/jpeg;base64," + data.imageData;
[08:58:21] <mylord> robertmaxrees: at this point in the code, I don’t necessary have the DOM in which the image data will be used
[08:58:50] <robertmaxrees> mylord you can create the node on the fly.
[08:59:01] <mylord> xec: but, I can just create the image DOM, change it, then pull out the base64 FROM the DOM element and throw the DOM element away
[08:59:13] <mylord> what i really want is just hte base64 after the crop
[08:59:20] <mylord> so i can pull that from the temp DOM element?
[08:59:21] <mylord> how?
[08:59:45] <robertmaxrees> you have to manually encode the image after the fact i'm guessing.
[09:00:12] <decx> something like this mylord http://jsfiddle.net/decx/g4mgh965/
[09:00:22] <xec> mylord: oh actually, yeah - that's the opposite. in that callback you already have the finished resized product - that example is just to show it
[09:00:23] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[09:00:27] <decx> *tips fiddle*
[09:00:29] <decx> m'lord
[09:00:33] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahaha
[09:00:54] <mylord> decx: awesome! trying
[09:01:12] <xec> very nice decx :)
[09:01:14] <duckxx> downloading ie8 on vbox seems a bit much
[09:01:23] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[09:01:25] <duckxx> any other way where it doesn't take up gigs of space ?
[09:01:29] <decx> well that's how it's done nowadays duckxx
[09:01:33] <duckxx> oic
[09:01:38] <robertmaxrees> i have 8, 9, and 10 for all regression testing.
[09:01:47] <robertmaxrees> might seem silly, but it's actually super convenient.
[09:01:50] <decx> there is also a program called ietester but it's shit
[09:02:02] <robertmaxrees> browserstack is another option.
[09:02:03] <duckxx> i remember there was a browser with all the ie's built in
[09:02:17] <stampz> hi
[09:02:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it wasn't very good for testing.
[09:02:25] <duckxx> http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage
[09:02:26] <duckxx> ??
[09:02:52] <robertmaxrees> just use the VMs.
[09:02:58] <duckxx> ok
[09:03:04] <robertmaxrees> don't go with hacked together solutions for that.
[09:03:22] <robertmaxrees> test in actual copies of the browsers.
[09:04:18] <duckxx> yea but i'd imagine someone would have just extracted the ie8 out as a portable app
[09:04:32] <duckxx> wow this is nuts.. its 4gigs
[09:04:38] <duckxx> download of the ie8 vm
[09:04:56] <robertmaxrees> they always do a crappy job of it.
[09:05:32] <robertmaxrees> 20.4 gigs for 8, 9, and 10 VMs.  storage is cheap.  worth it imo.
[09:05:38] <Zebba_de> $(this).parent().remove(this); this should remove the selected element from the parent, shouldn't it? I'm getting a console error... although the action is actually performed.
[09:05:51] <robertmaxrees> Zebba_de wat
[09:05:57] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to relove the selected element?
[09:06:04] <decx> that's so javascript ^^
[09:06:15] <decx> in jquery you can just remove() on the element
[09:06:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[09:06:31] <duckxx> storage isn't cheap when ur on a laptop
[09:06:33] <robertmaxrees> such javascript.  so imperative.  wow.
[09:06:40] <robertmaxrees> duckxx i'm on a laptop right now.
[09:06:47] <robertmaxrees> 20 gigs is well worth it if you care.
[09:07:07] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, cop out and test only in 8 and 11.
[09:07:16] <duckxx> i guess sooo
[09:07:18] <duckxx> thx
[09:07:29] <stampz> here is an example of my problem : http://toujoursplus.be/resource/F/systemes-dequations  : the youtube player is not displayed in firefox but it's in chrome.  i'm using the youtube api : http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/nhe4t00r/
[09:07:57] <robertmaxrees> stampz i see a youtube video on that page in FF>
[09:09:14] <robertmaxrees> oh and duckxx btw it's 10 gigs total if you delete the .rar files for the VMs.
[09:10:13] <stampz> damn it, so is the issue only with some versions of ff :/
[09:10:25] <stampz> what os are you using ?
[09:10:30] <robertmaxrees> windows 7
[09:10:37] <robertmaxrees> ff 33
[09:10:38] <stampz> thanks for take a look btw
[09:11:36] <robertmaxrees> updating to 33.0.2 breaks it.  your appid is invalid.
[09:11:43] <robertmaxrees> oh that's facebook.
[09:12:10] <stampz> interesting
[09:12:29] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a functioning example in jsfiddle?
[09:13:16] <mylord> xec: does this make sense: https://gist.github.com/adaptivedev/8b60554b8b6ce04d7c8c
[09:15:15] <stampz> robertmaxrees> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/ex4av1ww/3/
[09:15:34] <mylord> on line 7 i need to get base64 from imgCropped somehow.. should i use canvas?
[09:15:38] <xec> mylord: maybe, if you want imgCropped to be a <img> after all?
[09:15:58] <xec> mylord: data.imageData is already base64
[09:16:39] <mylord> xec: in my tempalte, i do this:               <img style="width:300px; height:300px;" src="data:image/JPEG;base64,{{selfie.image}}" />
[09:17:13] <mylord> so.. if i want to avoid changing anything (including my send-to-server functionality
[09:17:20] <mylord> then it’s best i just store the base64 i think
[09:17:23] <robertmaxrees> stampz works fine in the fiddle.
[09:17:30] <mylord> so i just want to pull out the base64 from the imgCropped
[09:17:32] <stampz> with both versions of ff ?
[09:17:40] <robertmaxrees> 33.0.2
[09:17:50] <robertmaxrees> the one it was broken in before.
[09:18:18] <xec> mylord: but.... data.imageData is already base64...
[09:18:29] <xec> just use that?
[09:18:35] <mylord> will try
[09:19:05] <stampz> robertmaxrees> alright, thanks mate, i see clearer now
[09:22:31] <Xatenev> Hmmm
[09:22:51] <Xatenev> question:
[09:22:58] <Xatenev> selectedFiltersDiv.remove('#' + objId + '-selected');
[09:23:10] <Xatenev> the element is inside the div "selectedFilters"
[09:23:15] <Xatenev> which is stored inside selectedFiltersdiv
[09:23:24] <Xatenev> and it has the id regionId-9-selected
[09:23:29] <robertmaxrees> $('#' + objId + '-selected').remove();
[09:23:31] <robertmaxrees> try that instead.
[09:23:49] <mylord> xec: got it .. but. the plugin brings up the android crop selector
[09:24:04] <ciccio> ciao
[09:24:13] <mylord> not really what i wanted.. i just wanted to force a square crop
[09:24:13] <Xatenev> great
[09:24:14] <Xatenev> thanks robert!: )
[09:24:21] <Xatenev> such a fail haha :D
[09:24:24] <mylord> so.. i’m take a picture,  and i just want it cropped to a square
[09:24:27] <mylord> how can i do it?
[09:24:42] <xec> mylord: you could use the code decx gave you
[09:25:13] <xec> or read the docs :)
[09:25:45] <Xatenev> Javascript makes fun when things work!
[09:25:45] <mylord> xec: :) which docs tho? all of all?
[09:25:45] <Xatenev> :D
[09:25:58] <PeterPorka> hi all, i have a strange bug with an ajax request in chrome and ie, with ff everything works fine: this is my call: http://pastebin.com/vGvvGbQ0 after doing this chrome adds an ? to the url and ie deletes the # in the url: url was index.php#
[09:26:23] <mylord> xec, decx: what do i change here to see things get cropped? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/g4mgh965/
[09:27:03] <mylord> changing “5” to anything else isn’t doing anything
[09:27:43] <xec> surely, it's doing *something*, it parameters are even commented
[09:27:52] <xec> it's
[09:27:52] <decx> this is just a superbasic example
[09:28:08] <decx> understand, enhance, dance
[09:28:32] <robertmaxrees> mylord read the comment on that line that tells you the order of the arguments.
[09:28:45] <robertmaxrees> and check out MDN for documentation on what they all mean and stuff.
[09:28:47] <mylord> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/adaptivedev/ng3yyp60/2/
[09:28:58] <mylord> should this one, with 50/25 sizes look different?
[09:29:17] <mylord> xec ^
[09:30:31] <xec> mylord: it's probably easier to play around with a larger image http://jsfiddle.net/g4mgh965/3/
[09:30:43] <xec> mylord: but i gotta go. good luck
[09:30:48] <mylord> thx
[09:32:41] <mylord> xec, decx: nothing happens when i change the numbers: http://jsfiddle.net/adaptivedev/g4mgh965/4/
[09:33:15] <xec> mylord: you are clicking the image, right?
[09:33:18] <xec> i mean
[09:33:21] <xec> you did read the code
[09:33:26] <decx> yeah right
[09:33:36] <xec> mylord: i mean, img.onclick = function () { is pretty basic
[09:33:36] <mylord> doh! k
[09:33:45] <mylord> right, i didn’t spot it
[09:33:48] <xec> :P
[09:34:05] <xec> *afk*
[09:37:08] <kegster> is there an example of an animated illustration using jquery or not. i've seen various ones with sceneries and stuff, but i'm curious to see what they're doing for things like a machine with moving parts or something like that
[09:40:16] <decx> jquery doesnt deal with this stuff
[09:41:14] <PeterPorka> okay, i figured out that it is the form action="", if i add this: form action="javascript:;"  it works with chrome and ff but ie unloads the content any workrounds?
[09:41:48] <robertmaxrees> bind to the form submit event and prevent the default action instead.
[09:45:30] <verumequals> evening
[09:46:24] <PeterPorka> thx, works!
[09:47:00] <PeterPorka> cool! have a nice day all!
[09:47:10] <printForever> ok, so I get this is dumb
[09:47:15] <printForever> but there is no where else to ask
[09:47:51] <printForever> I'm trying to apply .hover() on all A tags that have a DIV sibiling
[09:48:15] <printForever> $('#megamenu a').next('div').hover(function() {...
[09:48:18] <printForever> is not working, at all
[09:48:51] <printForever> jQuery is working, I've checked that
[09:48:59] <decx> you're applying the hover event to the divs
[09:49:02] <printForever> but I cant get this crap to work
[09:49:14] <printForever> oh for crying out loud :(
[09:49:28] <printForever> then how do I filter out the results?
[09:49:33] <decx> with filter :>
[09:49:40] <printForever> I tried :has(div)
[09:49:43] <printForever> but it also failed
[09:49:47] <BillCriswell> $('#megamenu a').filter(function(){ return $(this).next('div').length > 0; }).hover(...)
[09:50:07] <BillCriswell> printForever: Better yet, $('#megamenu a + div')
[09:50:09] <kegster> decx, was that for me?
[09:50:12] <BillCriswell> I think.
[09:50:23] <BillCriswell> Dammit not better yet.
[09:50:30] <printForever> ouh... I see... BillCriswell...
[09:50:31] <BillCriswell> First thing I said is what you want lol
[09:50:39] <printForever> you cant use + because it will apply to the div
[09:50:45] <printForever> yeah, first solution is valid
[09:50:52] <BillCriswell> yes, caugth that too late.
[09:50:55] <BillCriswell> First thing I said would work.
[09:51:00] <printForever> yeah...
[09:51:04] <printForever> thanks for the heads up
[09:51:12] <printForever> I thought there was a more elegant solution
[09:51:16] <BillCriswell> Sorry my window doesn't always scroll.
[09:51:29] <printForever> thats why I was digging and digging
[09:51:34] <BillCriswell> printForever: filter() is bootyful.
[09:51:42] <decx> kegster yes
[09:54:09] <kegster> kegster, javascript isnt used for animations?
[09:54:16] <printForever> $('#megamenu a').filter(function(){	return $(this).next('div').length > 0; }).hover(function() { $(this).toggleClass('showup'); });
[09:54:19] <kegster> i know jquery isnt js but still
[09:54:25] <kegster> seen jquery used for animations as well
[09:54:36] <printForever> it works
[09:54:53] <kegster> http://se-oh.seoapt.com/machine/
[09:54:55] <decx> there's a difference between animating a dom element and having actual graphical animations
[09:55:02] <kegster> ahhh i hear ya
[09:55:02] <Xatenev> I got this array
[09:55:03] <Xatenev> ["regionId-9"]
[09:55:08] <Xatenev> its called selected
[09:55:12] <Xatenev> then i try to call it using
[09:55:12] <kegster> throwing some stuff together to just play around and i'm thinkin using setInterval isnt the way to go
[09:55:13] <kegster> maybe it is
[09:55:16] <kegster> seems to work fine
[09:55:16] <Xatenev> selected['regionId-9']
[09:55:19] <Xatenev> gives me "UNDEFINED"
[09:55:21] <Xatenev> Oo?
[09:55:36] <kegster> decx, ^^ sorry that link was for you :D
[09:55:45] <Xatenev> any help on dis? :d
[09:56:02] <decx> kegster that implementation is aweful
[09:56:06] <kegster> i know it is
[09:56:15] <kegster> i've literally never done anything like this before lmao
[09:56:18] <decx> the easiest way is a spritemap that you animation with css
[09:56:21] <kegster> i was just playing w loops and animations
[09:56:29] <decx> animate*
[09:56:40] <kegster> it LOOKS good once it gets going but i realized it's kinda a strange way to go at it lmao
[09:56:49] <kegster> not bad for my first one eh? never knowing of even sprite animations for it? heh
[09:56:58] <kegster> obviously textbook its prob awful
[09:57:10] <Xatenev> Guis? :(
[09:57:42] <kegster> decx, have any examples of what you're referring to? maybe a link of some info on it? i'm assumning html5 and css3
[09:58:11] <decx> i'll cook up an example
[09:58:37] <kegster> hmm i just found a few examples that had an image and stuff
[09:58:44] <kegster> http://jsfiddle.net/simurai/CGmCe/ and http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/css-sprite-sheet-animations-steps
[09:58:52] <kegster> are these what you refer to, or perhaps a diff method?
[09:59:06] <kegster> i imagine the frame has to be the same size all around
[09:59:23] <bbclover> hey guys, if I have some jquery in a function, do I need to wrap it with the document ready?
[09:59:33] <robertmaxrees> depends
[09:59:39] <decx> right that's the idea kegster
[10:00:36] <bbclover> what do it depend on robert?
[10:00:40] <jerry_____> Could someone help explain the code in this answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8612894/how-to-chain-ajax-calls-using-jquery
[10:01:09] <robertmaxrees> bbclover are you loading your code in the <head>?  if so, does it rely on content in the page to operate?
[10:01:15] <jerry_____> I'm not sure what the deferredAjax option at the top does
[10:01:24] <jerry_____> :)
[10:02:13] <robertmaxrees> bbclover basically, document ready basically makes the code wait until the page is ready to run - this is useful if you have selectors you're going to run right away.
[10:02:28] <bbclover> oh yes!
[10:04:18] <bbclover> robertmaxrees I'm just adding some css to this list when this button is clicked, do I need $(document).ready(function() { $('whatever').css() }); or can I remove that function()?
[10:04:37] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :(
[10:04:50] <robertmaxrees> if you're adding CSS on pageload, don't use javascript to do it.
[10:04:56] <robertmaxrees> include a stylesheet instead.
[10:05:08] <robertmaxrees> oh derp can't read.
[10:05:34] <robertmaxrees> if your JS isn't at the end of your page, your event binding would need to be in the document ready, yes.
[10:21:45] <mylord> how can i easily remove up including the “,” and just keep the data after? src="data:image/png;base64,iVBOR
[10:22:11] <robertmaxrees> check out .split()
[10:22:13] <mylord> k
[10:22:39] <BillCriswell> of slice with indexOf.
[10:22:41] <BillCriswell> or*
[10:22:46] <BillCriswell> Depends how cool you are.
[10:22:52] <erms> hi - Im pulling large amounts of jsondata from an API, and then building a table from the results. But is there a best way to do this? Im iterating over the results "directly", should i build an array first or?
[10:23:14] <BillCriswell> erms: Isn't the json coming in as an array?
[10:24:44] <robertmaxrees> don't transform the data first imo.
[10:24:58] <erms> maybe it is. anyway im using tablesorter to sort the data, and it work perfectly with >200 results
[10:25:20] <erms> but not with more
[10:25:32] <erms> results/row
[10:25:36] <erms> does it make sense=
[10:25:54] <robertmaxrees> with more or less than 200 results?
[10:26:22] <erms> currently pulling in 1300 rows of data, and now it cant sort my table anymore
[10:26:36] <robertmaxrees> woah
[10:26:40] <robertmaxrees> that's some data
[10:26:40] <erms> so i thought maybe im doing something fundementally wrong
[10:27:11] <robertmaxrees> too much data hahaha
[10:27:16] <erms> :D
[10:27:25] <BillCriswell> If it's paginated it shouldn't be too bad though?
[10:27:37] <robertmaxrees> except what are you sorting at that point?
[10:28:13] <erms> its picture url/price/store/desc
[10:28:18] <erms> yeah maybe i should try to paginate it
[10:28:22] <erms> makes sense actually
[10:28:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to fix the sorting problems though.
[10:28:40] <robertmaxrees> you're still sorting the whole dataset
[10:29:16] <erms> whats best then should i try use datatables or dynatable instead
[10:29:35] <erms> do you guys think it has something to do with the plaugin
[10:29:41] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[10:29:47] <erms> allright
[10:29:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd look at doing server-side or building my own.
[10:30:11] <robertmaxrees> if i built my own, i'd sort data and render it out nstead.
[10:30:38] <erms> oh so arrange to data when rendering it
[10:30:46] <robertmaxrees> before rendering it.
[10:30:49] <robertmaxrees> sort data, render it out.
[10:33:11] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: That's what i was saying, sorting an array that large is pretty simple, sorting that many dom elements is another story. I guess it depends how datatables or whatever works.
[10:33:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:33:55] <robertmaxrees> push into a fragment, then pop the fragment into place in one fell swoop.
[10:39:11] <erms>  ty robert and bill
[10:40:21] <respek> Hi all :) do you all use a particular resource when figuring out what an error means?
[10:40:38] <robertmaxrees> experience and google.
[10:40:49] <respek> right
[10:41:12] <respek> so there's not really a central repo of what an output might mean then. that would sure be helpful sometimes
[10:41:20] <robertmaxrees> err.
[10:41:33] <robertmaxrees> lots of errors tell you what the actual problem is imo.
[10:42:23] <respek> Ok, when you read this, what does it say to you? (regardless of context, I'm curious to hear your analysis of the message) "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'querySelector' of null"
[10:42:43] <robertmaxrees> that means you're running querySelector on an object that doesn't exist.
[10:43:20] <respek> so it's not really reading it, but rather experience that's telling you that
[10:43:28] <robertmaxrees> it's totally reading it.
[10:43:35] <robertmaxrees> "Cannot read property 'querySelector' of null"
[10:43:37] <decx> property querySelector of null
[10:43:41] <decx> null.querySelector
[10:43:51] <respek> oh interesting!
[10:43:56] <respek> I didn't even read it like that
[10:44:06] <decx> so usually you have document.querySelector()
[10:44:07] <robertmaxrees> the evaluation is getting you a return of null somewhere.
[10:44:23] <decx> or element.querySelector
[10:44:26] <robertmaxrees> that null return then has a chained querySelector propp on it.
[10:44:34] <decx> but if no element is found for element then it's null
[10:44:37] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[10:44:51] <decx> that's the nice thing about jquery always creating an object regardless if something is found or not
[10:44:52] <robertmaxrees> if your code is breaking inside a plugin or something similar, that usually means you're feeding it a bad selector or object.
[10:45:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ decx some plugins don't use that convention fully though.
[10:45:42] <decx> well ... always* it is then
[10:45:58] <respek> !api querySelector
[10:45:58] <b-ot> respek: No matches.
[10:46:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not apart of jquery.
[10:46:10] <robertmaxrees> !g mdn querySelector
[10:46:11] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: document.querySelector() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.querySelector
[10:46:19] <decx> yes it's apart from jquery
[10:46:23] <decx> *chuckle*
[10:46:33] <respek> nice, didn't know how to do the api of other things
[10:46:42] <robertmaxrees> mdn is your best friend.
[10:46:48] <respek> indeed
[10:47:57] <robertmaxrees> is that error coming from within a plugin or something?
[10:48:30] <doug64k> respek the call stack of the error tells you a lot too
[10:48:38] <respek> a bit of javascript I'm trying to implement to the end of making  a preloader for a page
[10:48:44] <respek> so yes
[10:48:48] <doug64k> see if/where the call came from in your code
[10:49:05] <respek> as in the line?
[10:49:11] <doug64k> the call stack
[10:49:27] <doug64k> who called the function that crashed, and who called that, all the way back to the js engine
[10:49:47] <doug64k> it is in the sources tab in chrome
[10:52:25] <respek> ok, found it, but it's showing me a file other than the one the console is saying an error came from
[10:52:45] <respek> pretty neat tool though, I bet debugging is made a lot easier when you use this
[10:52:51] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:52:58] <robertmaxrees> step debuggers can be a godsend.
[10:53:17] <respek> so do I refresh the page?
[10:53:29] <respek> I'
[10:53:37] <respek> scratch that, I'll figure out how to use it
[10:53:47] <respek> via google first, then I'll touch base
[10:53:57] <doug64k> respek: http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=79162
[10:54:25] <doug64k> respek: very much easier. native code NEEDS debuggers that good. in js it's just icing on the cake
[10:54:48] <respek> well, nothing shows up there, until I pause it
[10:55:04] <respek> so, there must be an issue with loading, right?
[10:55:07] <kegster> decx, so if say, a non css3 browser is being used, then what js/jquery method would be used to substitute my awful implementation? ha
[10:55:39] <respek> the item referenced must not be loaded, if that error is popping up, and there isn't anything in the call stack. (I think?)
[10:56:50] <doug64k> respek: in this case yes, I was pointing out the call stack being the "other" main source of information besides the error message itself
[10:57:14] <respek> ah! great! I really appreciate the guidance :)
[10:58:41] <doug64k> kegster: implemntation of what? I can
[10:58:50] <doug64k> t find your previous message
[10:59:56] <kegster> doug64k, i was saying it to decx but the msg was way up. basically i created animations with setInterval and decx showed me sprite animation (well, said the term and i found some examples)-- but the one i see uses addClass('WebKit') which seems odd to ahve to do
[11:00:27] <kegster> my implementation with setInterval apparantly was pretty awful haha
[11:00:42] <kegster> i've looked into sprite animations but perhaps i have not found the right example
[11:00:45] <kegster> idk
[11:00:55] <doug64k> kegster: when detecting browsers, it is a common practise to put the browser as a class name on body, then you can use descendent selectors that only apply to specific browsers
[11:01:04] <kegster> ahh ok
[11:01:08] <kegster> the author had a comment apologizing
[11:01:14] <robertmaxrees> but generally you should do feature detection instead.
[11:01:17] <kegster> http://simurai.com/blog/2012/12/03/step-animation/
[11:01:25] <kegster> / yeah, sorry.. but this demo uses appearance:none which hasn't good support anywhere else.
[11:05:24] <decx> kegster well you do an oldfashioned loop
[11:07:13] <decx> kegster something like http://jsfiddle.net/1tkh6u3v/
[11:14:30] <doug64k> kegster: based on decx's fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/1tkh6u3v/1/   makes the animation track real passage of time to determine frame, for smoothness, and uses animationFrame so unnecessary updates are skipped and to minimize flicker
[11:14:52] <decx> doesnt make sense doug :>
[11:14:53] <doug64k> msPerFrame determines animation rate
[11:15:03] <decx> when you can use requestAnimationFrame you can just use css3 animation ^^
[11:15:37] <doug64k> you can polyfill the animationframe code, then it will use setTimeout only when necessary
[11:16:10] <decx> a polyfill for a fallback, not bad :D
[11:17:43] <doug64k> at least then it will use the efficient/smooth animation apis if they are present
[11:18:37] <decx> but in those cases you use css3 animation anyway
[11:21:05] <kpl> I have some divs which I'd like to show/hide based on the values of some radiobuttons. The divs and the radiobuttons are added dynamically (jquery code communicating with a server through ajax), so I don't have a "fixed" "knockoutjs type" model. Is this a case where I could use knockoutjs to control the div show/hide? If so, I guess I would have to add dynamically a model to make ko observe...
[11:21:06] <kpl> ...the radiobuttons and "inject" data-bind="visible : ..." to the divs to show/hide. Does anyone know of any examples of this use case?
[11:21:20] <doug64k> any time you animate, never trust that the updates will happen at the correct rate. you must look at the real passage of time and make a frame for that time, not just blindly show the "next" frame
[11:21:28] <doug64k> it makes it look a lot smoother when you do that
[11:21:31] <robertmaxrees> kpl ask in a channel about knockout?
[11:22:07] <kpl> robertmaxrees: I did, but no answer at knockoutjs yet..
[11:22:23] <robertmaxrees> lol okay
[11:24:09] <kpl> How would I implement this using jquery? I'd like to add the rules for show/hide from the perspective of the divs to how/hide, letting them know which other element values to "observe".
[11:24:27] <robertmaxrees> err, you don't.
[11:24:42] <robertmaxrees> in jquery, you'd bind to the radio buttons and tell them what to show/hide.
[11:25:26] <kpl> That's why I was thinking about using knockoutjs.
[11:26:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you need to do it from the "perspective of the divs"
[11:28:30] <kpl> I don't need to. but I'd prefer to. I'm used to doing it this way in C++. Also, it would be useful to be able to setup a model with all the rules.
[11:29:07] <robertmaxrees> eh, don't try to apply that to browser-based things.
[11:29:20] <robertmaxrees> rely on events and how that model works instead.
[11:29:44] <kpl> Well, that's what knockoutjs tries to do.
[11:30:39] <robertmaxrees> probably because it bakes in an extra layer.
[11:31:09] <kpl> But if I could use the event model and jquery I don't mind.
[11:31:29] <robertmaxrees> bind to the radio change events, see which radio was clicked, and go from ther.e
[11:32:20] <kpl> I guess I could still apply the logic as seen from the elements to be shown/hidden by injecting change event handlers in the "observable" radiobuttons.
[11:32:40] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.
[11:32:54] <robertmaxrees> using code to inject listeners is really flaky and winds up giving you tons of headaches.
[11:33:06] <doug64k> kpl here is the non MVC trivially simple way http://www.jstraight.com/1134/1
[11:34:43] <kpl> doug64k: thanks
[11:36:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vhLnjpou/
[11:36:39] <robertmaxrees> this is another way.
[11:36:48] <robertmaxrees> similar concept.
[11:37:30] * CssN00b goodmorning and goodnight y'all
[11:37:52] <doug64k> I made mine show an initial tab so I factored out the pane change to be usable for events and init
[11:38:17] <doug64k> and I was using delegation, to a trivial .trigger at the end was insufficient
[11:38:19] <robertmaxrees> also doug64k if you want the value of an input use .val()
[11:38:36] <doug64k> i know that.
[11:38:42] <doug64k> why do you say that
[11:38:43] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[11:38:50] <robertmaxrees> why do i say what?
[11:38:55] <doug64k> use .val
[11:39:10] <robertmaxrees> in short because there's an entire method surrounding getting the value of an input.
[11:39:34] <decx> you have prop('value') in there
[11:39:46] <doug64k> I do that out of habit of doing it the raw javascript way
[11:39:55] <doug64k> yes I should use val there
[11:40:27] <doug64k> I've been forcing myself to use raw javascript here and there and it is polluting my jquery style a bit :D
[11:42:41] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[11:43:31] <doug64k> document.querySelector('input[name=sel]:checked').value is the raw js so I was thinking 'value' at the end there. I agree, use jquery if you are using jquery though
[11:44:54] <decx> i like to prefetch the elements into data btw
[11:45:51] <doug64k> so do I - but I can
[11:46:12] <doug64k> t make assumptions about someone's page. lookup every time is good enough for simple quick example.
[11:46:29] <doug64k> damn apostrophe on this laptop - I keep hitting enter instead :\
[11:46:43] <decx> ya blame the key and not the wurstfinger
[11:46:48] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:46:55] <doug64k> lol
[11:47:01] <robertmaxrees> "wurstfinger" - i forget you're german sometimes.
[11:47:43] <decx> sausagefingers just doesnt have the right ring to it
[11:49:03] <tharkun> How can I check that a page is loading jquery properly?
[11:49:31] <robertmaxrees> go to your console and type $.fn.jQuery
[11:49:59] <tharkun> undefined?
[11:50:00] <doug64k> dont rely on the alias. test for jQuery.fn.jQuery
[11:50:19] <tharkun> still undefined?
[11:50:19] <robertmaxrees> err, lowercase the jquery
[11:50:32] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.jquery - if that breaks, try jQuery.fn.jquery
[11:51:01] <tharkun> "1.6.4"
[11:51:05] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[11:51:07] <robertmaxrees> loaded.
[11:51:16] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[11:51:27] <robertmaxrees> if the first one works, you're a-ok.  if the first one doesn't but the second one does, then you're in noconflict.
[11:51:45] <robertmaxrees> which means you can't use $, but instead need to use an iife or something else if you want to use $
[11:51:56] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you have to use the jQuery name for everything instead.
[11:52:00] <tharkun> Ok.}
[11:52:09] <doug64k> do you have code that needs $? you can simply wrap an IIFE around it like (function($) { ... code ... }(jQuery));
[11:52:26] <robertmaxrees> or jQuery(function($) {}); if you need a doc ready.
[11:52:33] <doug64k> ^
[11:55:00] <robertmaxrees> spudzee_ hi :) saw you asking questions in ##javascript
[11:55:13] <robertmaxrees> awwww
[11:58:13] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: Thanks a lot. I'll recheck everything. I have the same script running perfectly on one page and it will not run on another. I'm kind of frustrated trying to debug this isue.
[11:58:31] <robertmaxrees> tharkun any js errors?
[11:58:53] <tharkun> none
[11:59:14] <robertmaxrees> define "it will not run".
[12:00:15] <robertmaxrees> like, have you tried console logging and stuff toi see if you can get something?
[12:00:54] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: I learned about half an hour ago that there is a debuging console.
[12:00:57] <doug64k> tharkun: watch the network pane in the debugger and reload. watch for any errors there
[12:00:59] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[12:02:27] <doug64k> tharkun: any missing or misplaced files should end up with a 404 (or other) error
[12:04:40] <tharkun> doug64k: I have access to the logs on realtime on the server. I've been expecting the browser to do an asynchronous request but it doesn't do it at all.
[12:04:47] <roadrunneratwast> hi!  my keyup event doesn't get noticed until the fifth key.  maybe this has to do with the previous field input being about this length and autocomplete is blocking it?  dunno?  anyone has expereince with this?  any workarounds?
[12:05:16] <doug64k> tharkun: you are expecting too much to work at once. first see that the code even properly loads on the client
[12:05:26] <BillCriswell> roadrunneratwast: The fifth character in an input or something?
[12:05:49] <roadrunneratwast> yes.  i type in "j"-"o"-"e"-"y"-"z"
[12:05:56] <doug64k> tharkun: are you using chrome?
[12:05:57] <roadrunneratwast> and the keyup only triggers on the "z"
[12:07:29] <tharkun> doug64k: no, I am not using chrome.
[12:07:44] <robertmaxrees> tharkun huh?
[12:07:53] <robertmaxrees> oh hah just saw doug's question.
[12:07:54] <tharkun> doug64k: the code is loaded into the page, as I can see it on the source of it.
[12:07:57] <doug64k> tharkun: I was going to give exact debugger instructions
[12:08:11] <robertmaxrees> firefox's tools are similar enough depending on the case, btw.
[12:08:14] <doug64k> since you are a beginner at this type of thing
[12:08:16] <tharkun> doug64k: Thanks. I use firefox
[12:08:33] <tharkun> :-D
[12:08:50] <BillCriswell> roadrunneratwast: Are you sure the document has focus when you start typing?
[12:08:50] <doug64k> tharkun: at the top of the debugger (toggled by F12 by the way) there is a network button. click that and reload
[12:09:18] <roadrunneratwast> i am not sure the document has focus.
[12:09:23] <roadrunneratwast> not sure what that means
[12:09:35] <doug64k> tharkun: make sure All is selected at the far bottom far left
[12:09:36] <roadrunneratwast> i click in the box and start typing.  isn't that focusing on the input?
[12:10:16] <doug64k> tharkun: that output will tell you if any files weren't brought over to the new server correctly
[12:10:23] <tharkun> doug64k: I get a 200 GET with a green bullet on the left
[12:11:12] <doug64k> tharkun: what is the "file"
[12:11:38] <tharkun> I'll be back in a moment. My 13:30 appointment arrived early.
[12:15:02] <bbclover> hey guys, I know this dom element has a certain class selector say 'a' can I do $('a').addClass('anotherclass')?
[12:15:08] <bbclover> Cause it doesn't seem to be working... I tried it
[12:15:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:15:52] <bbclover> It's a ul list
[12:16:00] <robertmaxrees> !paste
[12:16:00] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:16:03] <robertmaxrees> ^ share some code.
[12:17:02] <doug64k> bbclover: add a dot to lookup by class name .a   use a to select <a> tags
[12:17:47] <robertmaxrees> bbclover oh, you meant "class a", not "tag a"
[12:18:28] <bbclover> yeah haha I should've picked a better name in hindsight
[12:18:33] <bbclover> but that worked doug64k
[12:18:35] <bbclover> thanks
[12:19:08] <doug64k> bbclover: forgetting the . is a common problem and you should look for that bug first when you have selector problems
[12:19:48] <bbclover> yeah I'll remember that from now on!
[12:19:56] <bbclover> it makes sense now that I think about it
[12:20:35] <robertmaxrees> css selectors.
[12:22:14] <doug64k> I wonder why ##c++ disconnects people so much. it's not just me
[12:22:42] <doug64k> the irc servers are all on the same hardware aren't they
[12:22:56] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[12:23:04] <robertmaxrees> it's a network of boxes.
[12:23:21] <robertmaxrees> you could get dropped from a box, or a box could get dropped from the network
[12:23:23] <doug64k> lol. so ironic though right? the c++ one having reliability issues :D
[12:23:26] <robertmaxrees> it's very messy
[12:23:31] <robertmaxrees> that's not a box.
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> channels aren't boxes.
[12:24:02] <doug64k> I don't think I have seen #jquery be down once in years
[12:24:13] <robertmaxrees> because the channel doesn't "go down"
[12:24:29] <robertmaxrees> servers can drop from the network, which causes a large set of users to drop.
[12:24:56] <robertmaxrees> and depending on which side you're on, you'll see a few dozen users leave, or a few hundred.
[12:25:12] <tharkun> doug64k: When on the Network tab I hitted the reload button and I only get 200 for the html file.
[12:25:29] <doug64k> tharkun: then it isn't loading any js files. the js is in files right?
[12:25:38] <tharkun> yes.
[12:25:50] <tharkun> But there is no 404 either
[12:26:03] <robertmaxrees> that can mean the page isn't linking the resources correctly.
[12:26:13] <doug64k> tharkun: can you give a link or page to look at? if not, does it have any <script> tags?
[12:28:36] <tharkun> Sorry no nat traversals up to the development machine. And yes there are a few <script> tags lying around. I'll diff both the working and the nonworking files to look for differences and report back
[12:31:26] <tharkun> doug64k: Thanks a lot for teaching me about the debugging tool :) Old dog learning new tricks :)
[12:31:51] <doug64k> np
[12:43:27] <sergey> Hi. Please help me get work jquery validation http://jsfiddle.net/Graff/qexdc55w/ It works fine for button "Invest" (press "invest" button, then press another invest button in dialog) but for rest it works partially (if you press "Donate" button, then press another Donate button in dialog it will show wrong result)
[12:44:02] <banisterfiend> i have a _renderItem method defined as per here: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem  but i have a 'debugger' statement in there and it's clear it's not being called, what's up?
[13:13:35] <djam90> Is there an easy way to populate a select box with ajax data from server? It seems so much leg work in jQuery, especially after ng-options
[13:14:12] <shoky> `demo @ banisterfiend
[13:14:12] <b-ot> banisterfiend: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:14:26] <banisterfiend> shoky i figured it out already, thanks :)
[13:14:44] <banisterfiend> shoky i needed to do it lke this: https://gist.github.com/ee1163636c9d07939bfe
[13:15:04] <banisterfiend> shoky so to define the _renderItem callback on the data("uiAutocomplete")
[13:15:14] <banisterfiend> it wasn't clear from the readme (for me, anyway) but it works now, thx
[13:19:44] <jdo_dk> How can i "keep" the "object/input" inside my  $.post? This code, will, if post is to slow, alert the same date, cause date is set outside $.post().. http://jsfiddle.net/9pauctuf/
[13:24:09] <P0rk> if you handle the change event on a parent element, the item clicked is still event.target, right?
[13:24:20] <shoky> jdo_dk: http://jsfiddle.net/9pauctuf/1/
[13:24:46] <djam90> Is there an easy way to populate a select box with ajax data from server? It seems so much leg work in jQuery, especially after ng-options
[13:25:00] <djam90> ^ in AngularJS
[13:25:10] <shoky> P0rk: yea
[13:25:21] <jdo_dk> shoky: And as elem is used inside $.post, it will not change ?
[13:25:40] <shoky> jdo_dk: nope, only "this" changes
[13:25:41] <P0rk> thx, duh...it's not $('e.target')...lol
[13:25:52] <jdo_dk> shoky: Perfect. Thanks mate
[13:28:34] <shoky> djam90: http://jsfiddle.net/9pauctuf/2/
[13:29:35] <djam90> shoky, wow, that is really NOT a lot of work
[13:29:42] <djam90> much faster than my methods before
[13:30:14] <decx> neat use of map
[13:30:14] <djam90> shoky, why the [0] at the end
[13:30:44] <decx> puts the raw created element in the array and not the jqueryized version
[13:30:58] <shoky> ^ even though it seems to work ok without the [0] too, in this case
[13:31:04] <djam90> ah I see
[13:31:15] <decx> no need for all these wrappers
[13:31:21] <djam90> Thanks guys
[13:31:53] <shoky> no probs
[13:32:06] <decx> so does append([array]) do one reflow or [].length´s
[13:32:11] <doug64k> don't fear the wrapper though - the overhead isn't a lot
[13:32:16] <doug64k> only worry for huge numbers
[13:33:47] <doug64k> the majority of what makes a selector seem heavyweight is in the prototype
[13:42:57] <decx> shoky .append([array]) is actually many appends()
[14:04:35] <shoky> decx: ah didn't notice you asked. yeah that sounds like what i remember. not the most-performant way, but i don't think it should cause multiple reflows
[14:08:47] <P0rk> uuggh. I can't figure out why number 3 and 4 are showing their details:  http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5cm86cwk/7/
[14:20:05] <shoky> P0rk: questReponse/questResponse
[14:22:06] <P0rk> wow. I was looking at what you posted and thoughtl---what? They are the same... LOL Thanks so much
[14:22:15] <shoky> ;p
[14:23:10] <P0rk> what's wild is the typo was in the working piece. So I had to typo it several times without knowing...ugly.
[15:20:18] <Yahkob-Alt> if I did $('body').on('mouseup', someFunc) can't i just do $('body').off(someFunc) ?
[15:20:52] <Yahkob-Alt>  $('body').off('mouseup', someFunc)  sorry
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> per the docs at http://api.jquery.com/off/, yes
[15:24:54] <robertmaxrees> awww he left.
[15:28:28] <tharkun> doug64k: After messing with the headers it finally loads jquery.
[15:29:13] <tharkun> Next step how can I see why the plugging is not generating a request. I'm dealing with the cascade plugin.
[15:30:05] <dmsuperman> the javascript console/debugger is usually a good place to start :)
[15:30:35] <b-lew> does getJSON not work in ie9 and ie8?
[15:31:39] <b-lew> is there a fix for this?

[15:33:52] <johnnybr> Hello guys
[15:34:09] <johnnybr> I have a small problem with jquery tabs
[15:34:32] <johnnybr> I'm not sure hot to use beforeLoad event
[15:34:47] <johnnybr> I want my tabs not loading on page refresh
[15:35:01] <tharkun> do
[15:35:01] <johnnybr> just focused tab to be loaded
[15:35:36] <johnnybr> someone can help me with this one? thanks
[15:36:03] <tharkun> doug64k: Aloha. For some reason doctype html is making the browser spit out inconsistencies. Plus a typo on an id messed everything up. Thanks for your help I learned a heck of a lot of stuff today. :)
[15:37:38] * tharkun hits the crap out of firefox with a baseball bat for missbehaving.
[15:38:02] <dmsuperman> Don't hit firefox for instructing it poorly!
[15:38:03] <dmsuperman> :P
[15:39:45] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I have a file type input that I use to upload csv files. Any idea how I can have a progress bar for the upload?
[15:40:06] <Scriptonaut> all the things I've read about assume you're uploading via AJAX, I'm just submitting it normally in a form
[15:40:19] <Scriptonaut> but I guess to upload like that, it must be async, so I'm not sure
[15:41:51] <doug64k> b-lew you left already
[15:41:52] <dmsuperman> this looks useful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2714507/jquery-ajax-upload-with-progress-bar-no-flash
[15:41:56] <doug64k> http://www.jstraight.com/1136/1
[15:42:04] <dmsuperman> Scriptonaut: ^
[15:42:13] <dmsuperman> I don't think it's cross browser though
[15:42:17] <dmsuperman> you may want to switch to $.post
[15:42:35] <dmsuperman> IE <10 won't work with normal form submission
[15:42:44] <doug64k> tharkun: np
[15:44:18] <doug64k> who logs onto an irc, complains about ie not working or something, then quits 10 seconds after
[15:44:30] <dmsuperman> b-lew
[15:44:42] <dmsuperman> :P
[15:44:47] <doug64k> lol
[15:46:53] <doug64k> Scriptonaut: you can try the progress callback on the deferrd in the xhr
[15:47:20] <doug64k> $.get('foo').progress(function(whoknows) { ... update progress ui ... })
[15:48:30] <doug64k> .done(function() { show done in ui })
[15:48:46] <doug64k> .fail(function() { show error in ui })
[15:49:44] <cjohnson> he's not using ajax currently
[15:50:20] <Scriptonaut> ^
[15:50:58] <doug64k> you want to show progress with the legacy post-reload-the-page scenario
[15:51:03] <doug64k> ?
[15:51:35] <Scriptonaut> ya, maybe I don't really understand how the file upload is working :P
[15:52:03] <doug64k> it works as you expect, it's multipart form data and one is a giant blob of file data
[15:52:10] <doug64k> just like any post
[15:53:05] <doug64k> most posts use urlencoded but that is probably the only significant difference from a file post
[15:54:32] <Scriptonaut> oh, so the actual uploading doesn't happen until you submit?
[15:55:05] <doug64k> I am not making stuff up. I've made file upload ui with FileReader and showed progress ui with no reloading etc.
[15:55:26] <Scriptonaut> I don't think you're making it up
[15:56:15] <doug64k> my suggestion, use the .send method on xhr. pass a FileReader parameter, it will send the file
[15:56:27] <Scriptonaut> alright, thanks
[15:56:32] <doug64k> or use a plugin, then just follow their docs

[17:30:49] <rubyonrailed> Hey could someone take a look at my fiddle.  If I add the checkbox first then choose from the dropdown the total works.  But vice versa it gives the wrong total.  http://jsfiddle.net/z1s5h2tk/1/
[17:31:41] <Technodrome> anyone here really good at finding weird JS problems ? lol
[17:32:03] <annoymouse> Need help
[17:32:42] <annoymouse> http://pastebin.com/BWzHzGDa
[17:32:45] <annoymouse> That's my HTML
[17:33:04] <annoymouse> How can I get the form data?
[17:37:32] <shoky> $('form').serialize()   but give your inputs "name" attributes
[17:39:40] <annoymouse> shoky: And is that going to be JSON?
[17:39:44] <annoymouse> or a string?
[17:40:30] <annoymouse> I want the actual values of the two <input>s
[17:40:39] <annoymouse> Because I plan on adding them to a DB
[17:43:00] <kegster2> decx, http://se-oh.seoapt.com/machine/
[17:43:09] <kegster2> i haven't finished converting all over to sprite animations
[17:43:29] <kegster2> :D
[17:43:43] <kegster2> curious if my implementation is better
[17:43:59] <shoky> annlewis: it'll be a query string, like "name=value&foo=bar"
[17:44:21] <shoky> annlewis: which is what would get sent if you just do a regular form post
[17:46:14] <shoky> er sorry, meant annoymouse ^
[17:46:40] <annoymouse> shoky: tbh I don't really know what I'm doing
[17:47:00] <annoymouse> I just want to make a form that's contents will be added to a database
[17:47:03] <shoky> sounds like a good time to learn
[17:47:34] <shoky> do you even want to send it via ajax?
[17:47:39] <annoymouse> But I'm not sure if I should process the input in the JS and then send that to the database or if I should just send the stuff to the server and do it there
[17:47:44] <shoky> you can just do a regular form submit. just give your inputs names
[17:47:45] <annoymouse> shoky: Not yet
[17:47:54] <shoky> no need for any js code, for that
[17:47:59] <annoymouse> shoky: I've tried that
[17:48:06] <annoymouse> shoky: But then I need server code
[17:48:10] <annoymouse> I've yet to write that
[17:48:24] <shoky> hm?
[17:48:31] <annoymouse> maybe not
[17:48:39] <shoky> you need the server to write ot to a DB, no?
[17:48:49] <shoky> it*
[17:49:18] <shoky> yes, you need server code
[17:49:24] <annoymouse> shoky: I need the DB to be written to. I don't really care if it's done through a server or if the client just connects directly to the DB
[17:49:54] <shoky> you don't want clients to connect directly to your DB ;)
[17:50:15] <annoymouse> shoky: I figured that. So do I need id's, or can I use only name's?
[17:50:36] <shoky> names, if you want them to be sent when the form is submitted
[17:50:49] <shoky> but.. that's not worth anything without server code. same goes for ajax
[17:51:03] <annoymouse> shoky: So now let me write the server code in Node
[17:51:16] <shoky> sounds like a good next step ;P
[17:51:27] <annoymouse> shoky: where do I put where the submit should go to?
[17:51:42] <annoymouse> Like how will it know where the server is?
[17:52:33] <shoky> the <form>'s "action" attribute determines what url it'll submit to
[17:52:54] <shoky> usually it's on the same server
[17:53:13] <shoky> (same server as the one the page was loaded from)
[17:54:01] <annoymouse> shoky: So then where do I put the redirect after it's submitted?
[17:54:32] <shoky> not sure what you mean
[17:55:22] <shoky> the server should reply with the next page, or return an http redirect to the next url
[17:55:41] <shoky> (for a normal non-ajax submit)
[17:57:13] <annoymouse> shoky: Ah!
[17:57:17] <annoymouse> You're a genius
[17:57:31] <shoky> ;]
[18:54:40] <wa5ted_> shoky: be a genius liek from forever ;P
[19:09:15] <schtinky> hi. Question: $('a[href^="user?id="]') gives me an array of strings equal to the href values of all <a> tags with an href matching that selector... but I want an array of objects, not strings. For instance, I need to do result[x].html() on each value.
[19:10:23] <schtinky> what am I doing wrong? usually i can do a selector $("#someid").html() and get the innerhtml of the tag. so I'm not understanding why the multi selector above only gives me string values I can't work with
[19:10:58] <P0rk> setup a fiddle
[19:13:18] <schtinky> I'm not sure what good that would do me. I'm just shooting in the dark. How do I tell jquery "give me objects, not strings"?
[19:13:31] <P0rk> jquery gives you objects
[19:13:38] <P0rk> a fiddle will help to demonstrate the problem
[19:14:07] <P0rk> because as it stands, it sounds like you are doing something else. $("
[19:15:23] <P0rk> $("a[href^['user?id=']") should give you a collect of anchor elements whose href attr starts with user?id=
[19:15:59] <schtinky> http://jsfiddle.net/nvcadytu/
[19:16:36] <BillCriswell> Thanks for all those alerts.
[19:16:40] <P0rk> lol
[19:17:03] <schtinky> if I try to .html() on the items in the array, it says "these are only strings" or whatever
[19:17:04] <P0rk> It's because $("something")[1] refers to the html element not the
[19:17:18] <schtinky> ah
[19:17:35] <P0rk> try .eq(x)
[19:17:45] <P0rk> that will cycle through the jquery elements.
[19:17:50] <P0rk> ++ jsfiddle
[19:18:21] <schtinky> perfect
[19:18:37] <schtinky> I'm just using $(array_of_elements[x]).html()
[19:18:42] <schtinky> and that works for me
[19:18:49] <schtinky> thanks and sorry for the alerts
[19:18:54] <BillCriswell> lol
[19:19:31] <P0rk> array_of_elements.eq(x).html() is a lot better
[19:20:44] <BillCriswell> What do you need to do to the html?
[19:34:58] <schtinky> why is array_of_elements.eq(x) better than $(array_of_elements)[x]?
[19:36:49] <schtinky> oops I mean why is array_of_elements.eq(x) better than $(array_of_elements[x])
[19:37:20] <P0rk> every time you $() anything, it's costly
[19:37:51] <P0rk> you've already got the object with the items in it, so no need to create new objects, then grab their html
[19:38:08] <P0rk> $() creates a new object
[20:31:07] <P0rk> can I use jquery UI accordion with form field inputs?  I want to have a yes/no question on the bar that when answered yes, opens the accordian. Any suggestions?
[21:05:01] <dexkiki> hi. what's a dataPriv?
[21:11:54] <dexkiki> what is Data for?
[22:49:59] <abak> Hi all, I have a string that is basically the html from a wikipedia article, I want to remove all the element of class mv-editsection, in order to remove the [edit], so i did
[22:50:00] <abak> var filtered = $(data).find(".mw-editsection").remove()
[22:50:15] <abak> and filtered only contains the [edit] elements
[22:50:19] <abak> where did i go wrong
[22:53:36] <sinequanon> you didn't -- find will return whatever it finds
[22:54:07] <sinequanon> abak: ^
[22:54:10] <abak> it does indeed find all the <span class="mv-editsection"> in data
[22:54:44] <sinequanon> so what's your question?
[22:54:48] <abak> but when i call remove() on that, the output contains all removed spans -_-
[22:55:38] <sinequanon> the output, or your variable?
[22:55:59] <abak> in my example above, fitered contains only the spans i want to remove
[22:56:09] <abak> the input variable data is unchanged
[22:56:53] <sinequanon> would you expect find() to return to you everything but the stuff it found?
[22:57:09] <sinequanon> (say no)
[22:57:13] <abak> no i would expect remove to remove the stuff i pass it
[22:57:19] <abak> not to keep only that
[22:57:25] <abak> or should i do
[22:57:36] <abak> var filtered = $(data).find(!".mw-editsection").remove()
[22:57:49] <abak> or whatever would return all elements but the ones i want to keep?
[22:58:31] <abak> is it because the html string i want to filter is not part of the current dom?
[22:58:45] <sinequanon> you probably want not()
[22:59:38] <sinequanon> ...not part of the DOM?
[22:59:45] <sinequanon> are you parsing the DOM or a string?
[22:59:56] <abak> i'm parsing a string
[23:00:09] <abak> data is just a html string that wikipedia sends me
[23:00:15] <abak> so that's my issue
[23:00:33] <abak> remove() removes stuff from the current document, not from whatever i pass it
[23:01:56] <sinequanon> so essentially you have $("<html><head></head><body></body></html").find(...) ?
[23:03:29] <abak> essentially, i have this : http://pastebin.com/D39G42HY
[23:04:06] <abak> and i want to remove everything that looks like this :<span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>
[23:04:06] <abak>   <a href="/w/index.php?title=%E5%8A%B1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Japanese">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span>
[23:04:44] <sinequanon> right, but what are you passing to jQuery as the selector?
[23:04:47] <sinequanon> a giant string?
[23:06:18] <abak> sinequanon, yes
[23:06:58] <abak> i'm passing it $(data) where data is the result of my query, i.e. my giant string
[23:07:28] <abak> if i believe SO it should work :http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1811279/convert-string-into-jquery-object-and-select-inner-element
[23:10:23] <abak> sinequanon, wasn't it what you meant by selector ?
[23:10:34] <sinequanon> yeah
[23:11:12] <abak> oh i got it
[23:11:38] <abak> essentially, i did this :
[23:11:39] <abak> var element = $(data);
[23:11:39] <abak>     element.find('.mw-editsection').remove();
[23:12:01] <abak> and after the call to remove() element doesn't contain the stuff i wanted to remove
[23:12:50] <abak> i guess that $(x) returns the object i wanted, and when chaining the calls it wasn't completely instanciated, kindof like a rvalue
[23:13:48] <shoky> abak: it was instanciated, but you never assigned the original object to a variable until now
[23:13:57] <shoky> you assigned the return value of .remove()
[23:14:03] <abak> yeah
[23:14:09] <shoky> of .find(..).remove()  to be more precise
[23:14:19] <abak> for my personnal spaience, what happens to the object that wasn't assigned ?
[23:14:28] <shoky> which one is that?
[23:14:28] <abak> automagically destroyed when the function exits ?
[23:14:43] <shoky> oh if you jsut do  $(data).find(..).remove() ?
[23:14:49] <abak> in var filtered = $(data).find(!".mw-editsection").remove(), the return value of $(data)
[23:15:07] <shoky> then yeah it's automagically destroyed by the garbage collector, because there's no reference to it
[23:15:28] <shoky> or well, your "filtered" would have an internal reference to it
[23:16:00] <shoky> so it'd stick in memory as long as "filtered" would, you could probably access it through filtered.end()
[23:16:30] <abak> ok i see
[23:16:47] <abak> the return value of chained calls contains implicitly the return values of the intermediate calls
[23:17:44] <shoky> for methods that aren't getters, yes
[23:18:18] <abak> WTF
[23:18:28] <abak> why are getters treated differently by the language ?
[23:18:37] <shoky> it's just what makes sense
[23:18:43] <shoky> getters are used to return some value
[23:18:58] <shoky> not implicilty return the previous objet
[23:19:28] <shoky> wouldn't make sense if:  var href = $('bla').find('child').attr('href');
[23:19:41] <shoky> wouldn't make sense if that returned  a jquery object ;p
[23:19:49] <shoky> that's what i mean by getters
[23:19:53] <shoky> (attr in this case)
[23:20:00] <abak> is it a jquery thing or a js thing ?
[23:20:06] <shoky> well, and .find is also a getter
[23:20:55] <shoky> it's a jquery thing, but it's nothing special about getters, it's the setters that are "special" in that they explicitly return the previous jquery object, and not just undefined like you'd expect from a classical setter
[23:21:19] <abak> ok
[23:21:22] <shoky> getters always return what you're getting, in any language/lib ;p
[23:21:29] <abak> tbh i don't expect anything at this point
[23:22:06] <hExDJ> how can I prevent my page from refreshing when clicking on anchors
[23:22:14] <shoky> a setter function is meant to set something, not get some value. so you'd expect it not to return a value.
[23:24:23] <hExDJ> I know I should use event.preventDefault();, but how do I make sure it only applies to a tags that link to an anchor
[23:25:09] <Technodrome> i want an opinion on how someone would implement something
[23:28:52] <sinequanon> Technodrome: go ahead
[23:29:06] <Technodrome> mind if i PM you the link? :)
[23:30:41] <sinequanon> sure
[23:30:49] <sinequanon> tits or gtfo
[23:47:07] <Jamesonwa> Ive got a quick question.
[23:48:13] <Jamesonwa> I'm attempting to select a "onclick" attribute of an <a> tag with a jquery selector. The value of the attribute contains "return confirm('Remove this message?');"
[23:48:33] <Jamesonwa> Is that what I should be using?
[23:48:33] <Jamesonwa> $('a[onclick*="confirm"]')
