[01:53:09] <jak2000> is possible: check if $(this) is on the box:     $(this).closest('.clclonedInput').remove();       ?
[02:11:40] <Cork> jak2000: on the box?
[02:13:16] <senaps> http://jsfiddle.net/2k1nwpqj/ why is my find function not working?
[02:14:22] <Cork> uh
[02:14:29] <Cork> is "html" html or elements?
[02:14:40] <senaps> i can read key, value, element just fine, but it seems that i can't put them in the right place....
[02:14:42] <Cork> the code looks like it is element
[02:14:57] <Cork> but without calling information its hard to tell
[02:15:30] <senaps> Cork: html is a html string being passed and is the html <tr> thing returned in the end, without object objects! at the end of it...
[02:15:43] <Cork> then there is your problem
[02:15:59] <Cork> you're concating dom elements into your strings
[02:16:39] <senaps> yup.... this thing is supposed to work! actually it works on anther function.... it just doesn't work here... let me paste the whole code...
[02:17:06] <senaps> http://jsfiddle.net/o38tydk4/
[02:17:56] <senaps> so, makedata is working perfectley..... but makerow doesn't... they have some minor differences but i have tried the same code and didn't get any luck....
[02:37:28] <Cork> senaps: you can't concat elements with strings
[02:43:34] <senaps> so what should i do? why is it working in makedata and not in makerow?
[02:46:33] <Cork> senaps: if you ever do something like string += .parent() that is broken, and CAN'T EVER WORK
[02:47:25] <Cork> you have to either convert the dom elements to strings before you concat them (.html()) or convert the string to dom (.append(html), var dom = $(html) or variable.html(html))
[02:48:17] <Cork> convating dom elements in a string will just give you things like "<html>[Object object]"
[02:54:27] <Cork> convating... concating* -_-
[03:01:56] <senaps> typeof row values is string and numbers, so they seem okay, in the first line of makerow i added var html = $.parseHTML(row); and it didn't work...
[03:02:19] <Cork> html isn't string tehre
[03:02:24] <Cork> it is a dom
[03:02:30] <Cork> so var html is a lie
[03:07:55] <senaps> so html = $.parseHTML(row) then! it gives me an array object...
[03:08:06] <Cork> no it gives you dom elements
[03:08:10] <Cork> so again it isn't html
[05:58:49] <Neo1> Cork, hi
[06:00:48] <Neo1> Who know some comments systems beside the disqus? I need for my site
[07:27:17] <linurandy_> hello i've a jqueryui tabs and i want to reload with other content, how could i do that?
[07:27:35] <linurandy_> the active tabs of course
[10:09:53] <linurandy_> hello i've a jqueryui tabs and i want to reload with other content, how could i do that?
[10:09:56] <linurandy_> the active tabs of course
[10:20:09] <linurandy_> hello somebody that works with jqueryui
[10:23:16] <Cork> linurandy_: you mean like http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax ?
[10:23:38] <linurandy_> i've a jqueryui tabs and i want to reload with other content, how could i do that?
[10:23:40] <linurandy_> the active tabs of course
[10:23:57] <Cork> fetch the content and replace the content
[10:29:58] <linurandy_> yes clean de old content and push de new content
[10:32:11] <taplar> what part of that is confusing you?
[10:33:55] <pathrocle> whats wrong with this function https://dpaste.de/mjit , only works one time
[10:34:46] <taplar> pathrocle: hard to tell without markup to give it context
[10:35:30] <Cork> pathrocle: taken from the variable name i suspect $state.checked will be undefined
[10:35:44] <Cork> you most likely want $state.prop('checked')
[10:36:07] <Cork> but ya, too little context
[10:36:38] <pathrocle> cork, yeah that was it, thanks!
[10:37:14] <linurandy_> Cork: what o you think about that i wrote you?
[10:37:38] <Cork> linurandy_: i gave you how to do it, not sure what more you expect
[10:39:50] <Dfar> Hi, can someone explain me how to re-attach a data-role="panel" to his button after refresh all the panels wrapper ?
[10:40:22] <linurandy_> Cork: what do you think about that: $("#menu-entorno-activos").tabs().tabs("load","activos/mostrar/activo/"+tr.attr('id'));
[10:52:55] <jak2000> anyone can explain me: i have a button, that remove a div. (work OK)... but if i put this line under .don (ajax request) not work ?
[10:56:20] <shoky> very simple: you did something wrong.
[11:09:12] <jak2000> hi all i have 4 strings: str1="0:40"; str2="1:43"; str3="0:55"; str4="1:17";   how to sum the time?
[11:10:44] <taplar> i'd probably split by ':', sum the hours, then sum the minutes, / 60, add that to the hours and then % 60 the minutes
[11:11:05] <rabidus> don't divide
[11:11:14] <taplar> ?
[11:11:28] <rabidus> split by ':', multiply first by 60 and add second
[11:11:37] <rabidus> so there is no floats in between
[11:11:39] <rabidus> *are
[11:12:28] <taplar> so you're suggesting to take everything to the seconds minutes level?
[11:12:55] <jak2000> i need know the final time is XX Hours, YY Minutes
[11:13:03] <rabidus> oh
[11:13:09] <taplar> because you don't want the float from the / 60
[11:13:14] <taplar> just the integer part
[11:13:56] <jak2000> thanks...
[11:14:30] <rabidus> i just always try to avoid doing unnecessary floats if I don't need them
[11:19:17] <jak2000> final result: NumHours=3; NumMinutes=129;
[11:19:22] <jak2000> now?
[11:19:43] <taplar> divide numMinutes by 60
[11:19:54] <taplar> and you want just the integer part of it, so you'll Math.floor it i believe
[11:21:01] <taplar> those are the hours from the minutes that need to be added to the NumHours
[11:21:17] <taplar> then to get the remaining minutes just set it equal to NumMinutes % 60
[11:21:36] <rabidus> NumMinutes += NumHours*60; var FinalHours = Math.floor(NumMinutes/60); var FinalMinutes = NumMinutes%60;
[11:22:15] <taplar> or NumHours += Math.floor(NumMinutes/60);  NumMinutes = NumMinutes%60
[11:22:26] <taplar> no need to convert to minutes first
[11:24:52] <rabidus> if they were minutes in first place........
[11:25:00] <rabidus> but anyways
[11:26:18] <rabidus> my point is just that i try to floats where ever i can
[11:26:21] <jak2000> much thanks
[11:26:30] <rabidus> console.log(1.1 +1.1 + 1.1 === 3.3);
[11:26:33] <taplar> yours still had a float for the second operatoin
[11:26:35] <rabidus> that's false
[11:26:39] <taplar> but you added an extra step
[11:26:54] <taplar> so there's not much of an argument there
[11:27:01] <rabidus> thats when i need my answer
[11:27:04] <rabidus> not in the middle of calculation
[11:27:16] <rabidus> :|
[11:33:20] <jak2000> how to format a string str1="8"  to "08" ?
[11:33:28] <jak2000> only asking the length?
[11:34:23] <bjsnider> if i'm running a function from a button located in a node, can i replace the node using .html() with the ajax response? it seems not to work, but i get no error msg
[11:34:29] <taplar> i'd probably do a ternary, bu tyou might ask ##javascript about it
[11:34:29] <bjsnider> ie. node replaces itself
[11:35:29] <taplar> bjsnider: i'm not sure i understand the context you describe at the start of that question
[11:39:48] <jak2000> always str1="08:00"  minus str2="06:47"    with moment do the subtaction right?
[11:40:29] <taplar> heh, you want to subtract now?
[11:40:34] <jak2000> yes
[11:40:50] <taplar> heh, now!  convert to minutes first, :)
[11:41:24] <jak2000> and back to hours right?
[11:41:34] <taplar> yep
[11:42:07] <taplar> cause you could do it without going to minutes first, but you'd have to account for if you need to undo a remainder hour to get minutes for the minutes
[11:42:17] <taplar> subtracting at the lower minutes level is just nicer
[11:42:38] <taplar> but, yeah, if moment has something built in to do this, do it
[11:42:45] <taplar> i'm not that familiar with moment
[11:44:27] <bjsnider> taplar: i hope this makes it clearer: https://jsfiddle.net/fmza87uy/
[11:44:44] <bjsnider> i'm assuming the rest of ajax and the desired response
[11:45:23] <jak2000> thanks i am disconect now
[11:47:41] <taplar> bjsnider: ah, ok, so yeah you can do that
[11:47:56] <bjsnider> that would work?
[11:48:04] <taplar> sure
[11:48:17] <taplar> you're just changing the dom.  any javascript logic can change the dom
[11:50:12] <bjsnider> this must be a problem with how i'm using bootstrap's js, and not actually a js/jquery issue
[12:15:45] <bjsnider> there was a stackxchange question about this. the modal-backdrop was not being removed, so everything was working except that backdrop masked off the data so it wasn't selectable
[12:21:02] <bjsnider> seems to work fine if i manually toggle off the modal in the beforeSend
[12:25:23] <catbadger> having a terrible time with jqgrid. any fans in here?

[12:37:40] <jak2000> beautiful
[12:38:37] <rabidus> yeah, moment.js is nice
[12:45:28] <jak2000> var str1="08:00"; str2="06:47"; var start = moment(str1, "HH:mm"); var end = moment(str2, "HH:mm");
[13:47:33] <jak2000> anyone wirked with moment?
[14:07:08] <jameshalpert102> Anyone know if there is a callback for $.mobile.loading('show');  ?
[14:07:28] <jameshalpert102> as in, a callback for when the loader gets displayed
[14:11:11] <taplar> http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/  not sure what exactly you are referring to as the loader, but there are the events for the mobile
[14:24:56] <jameshalpert102> taplar: https://api.jquerymobile.com/loader/
[14:25:04] <jameshalpert102> I just the create event, it never gets called
[14:25:36] <taplar> what?
[14:26:04] <jameshalpert102> taplar, https://pastebin.com/5PEvTmaN
[14:26:06] <jameshalpert102> my code
[14:26:18] <jameshalpert102> "create called" never gets logged to the console
[14:26:27] <taplar> oh, no, that's not something you pass in
[14:26:34] <taplar> that's an event that gets thrown
[14:26:41] <jameshalpert102> what's the best way to do it then
[14:26:47] <taplar> so $(yourThing).on('create', function(){...});
[14:27:00] <taplar> like any normal event
[14:27:05] <jameshalpert102> $(".ui-loader").on('create' .. )  ?
[14:27:08] <jameshalpert102> in my case?
[14:27:12] <taplar> yeah, it's an event
[14:27:17] <jameshalpert102> ah okay let me try that then
[14:28:14] <taplar> https://api.jquerymobile.com/loader/#event-create  specifically, so i guess you can optionally pass it in
[14:44:37] <jameshalpert102> taplar, hm am I doing my on("create") method incorrectly? https://pastebin.com/KstyhS0C
[14:44:48] <jameshalpert102> "created spinner" isn't getting logged
[14:45:46] <jameshalpert102> I inspected the element, there's definitely a div with "<div id="func_1"> .. </div>
[14:46:07] <taplar> that element would have to exist at the time that logic is ran
[14:46:49] <taplar> i'm not entirely sure where the issue is, as you are trying to use $.mobile.loading() where as those docs show using the create as part of a specific element select
[14:48:12] <jameshalpert102> the issue is when that div is created, the event isn't getting called
[14:48:18] <jameshalpert102> the "create" event"
[14:50:20] <taplar> right, like i said, the element you are trying to bind on has to exist, but you are creating that element as part of that loading method
[14:50:28] <taplar> so i'm assuming you are trying to bind before it exists
[14:54:09] <jameshalpert102> oh
[14:54:12] <jameshalpert102> hm
