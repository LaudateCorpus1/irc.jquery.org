[00:31:18] <HansWurst> hey guys
[00:31:55] <HansWurst> i have a multi select-box (no dropdown) with a few options
[00:32:26] <HansWurst> i modified it with jquery so that the selected items can be toggled by a click
[00:32:56] <HansWurst> but it's still possible to select them with "dragging" from the first to the last and by holding the shift-key
[00:33:07] <HansWurst> is it possible to disable this somehow?
[00:45:41] <Tomashe> hey guys im trying t check sroll on live, container.on("scroll",".inner-con",function() { console.log(1) }); is not working
[00:45:44] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[01:25:22] <rodrigo23> can anybody tell me if a chat application is serverside or clientside
[01:28:23] <arthurvr> depends
[01:28:30] <arthurvr> but mostly server-side
[01:28:49] <arthurvr> rodrigo23 ^
[01:29:49] <rodrigo23> arthurvr: is there a good tutorial out there to make it almost like a panel where users could open windows to chat
[01:30:34] <arthurvr> not that I know
[01:30:40] <arthurvr> (about the windows panel thing)
[01:31:04] <rodrigo23> arthurvr:have you head of xmpp?
[01:31:25] <arthurvr> Yah
[01:31:30] <arthurvr> But never played around with it
[01:32:09] <rodrigo23> so if you were in my shoes what combination would you use for a site?
[01:32:32] <arthurvr> for just the chat socket.io, but don’t know about that windows thing
[01:34:46] <rodrigo23> arthurvr: so you never experimented with any technology for a chat application
[01:34:58] <arthurvr> of course I did
[01:35:22] <arthurvr> using socket.io
[01:35:29] <rodrigo23> there are many forms of web applications which did you use
[01:35:36] <arthurvr> http://socket.io/
[01:35:59] <arthurvr> using node
[01:36:22] <arthurvr> btw: making a chat application looks like totally reinventing the wheel
[01:36:48] <rodrigo23> yeah i know
[01:36:53] <rodrigo23> it sounds insane
[01:37:04] <arthurvr> http://tlk.io/ works so nice
[01:37:18] <rodrigo23> so is socket.io new
[01:37:29] <rodrigo23> i never heard of it
[01:37:34] <arthurvr> nope
[01:37:40] <rodrigo23> how old is that?
[01:37:41] <arthurvr> do you know node?
[01:37:47] <arthurvr> years
[01:37:55] <rodrigo23> im just a beginner looking to dig myself into this
[01:39:51] <rodrigo23> i just checked amazon and theres no books on socket.oi
[01:39:57] <rodrigo23> damn it
[01:40:09] <arthurvr> http://www.amazon.com/Socket-IO-Real-time-Web-Application-Development/dp/1782160787/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419241203&sr=8-1&keywords=socket.io
[01:40:56] <rodrigo23> is that the only bookon that subject?
[01:41:31] <arthurvr> Specific on socketIO yes, but most node books cover it
[01:41:45] <rodrigo23> yeah i got alot of node.js books
[01:42:13] <rodrigo23> did you check that books out?
[01:42:18] <rodrigo23> book*
[01:42:46] <arthurvr> I’ve readed that one
[01:43:04] <rodrigo23> did it increase your skill any much
[01:43:15] <arthurvr> It’s a must when you use node
[01:45:27] <rodrigo23> so to use socket.io i have to know node.js?
[01:45:38] <arthurvr> yah of course
[01:45:46] <arthurvr> but it isn’t difficult
[01:46:01] <arthurvr> it’s javascript
[01:46:21] <rodrigo23> yeah thep art that is difficult is putting an idea into the equation
[01:46:32] <rodrigo23> hard*
[01:46:39] <rodrigo23> part*
[01:46:57] <rodrigo23> its hard
[01:47:10] <arthurvr> You just shoudln’t reinvent the wheel
[01:47:42] <rodrigo23> but i dont want to use someone elses script what if it got error in one browser
[01:50:26] <Robdgreat> what if yours does?
[01:50:48] <arthurvr> you should just test it man
[01:51:03] <arthurvr> as said yours can do too
[01:51:29] <nikio> There are several ways to generate new HTML and modify the existing HTML structure on the client. Typical techniques, which are discussed in this chapter, are:
[01:51:29] <nikio> Generating the HTML structure dynamically using JavaScript and jQuery
[01:51:29] <nikio> Retrieving HTML fragments from the server and injecting them into the page
[01:51:30] <nikio> Using templates both to retrieve and to generate the HTML structure to insert into the page. im making a ToDo app.. which has ToDo elements created and modified by the user and saved in a db, which shoud I use?
[01:53:40] <rodrigo23> yeah your right from scratch is to much
[01:55:11] <rodrigo23> ill be back later i got some unfinished bussinuss to attend to
[02:22:31] <Silmarilion> can anyone explain me why is scrollstop not working? http://jsfiddle.net/00hcjh7d/4/
[02:35:12] <wa5ted> Silmarilion: scroll is to the docuent not the div

[03:20:47] <wa5ted> HansWurst: not familiar but let me give it a shot, whats up
[03:23:50] <Novus3013> Hello! If there is someone with nick ajpiano?
[03:24:08] <Novus3013> I've seen his work on Patterns of jQuery
[03:24:41] <Novus3013> So, I've got 2 questions if the Eclipse has debug for jQuery
[03:25:02] <Novus3013> and how can I modify some apsects of jQuery plugin?
[03:27:19] <Novus3013> Aga, ~ found in my home directory plugin, weights 255Kb
[03:27:58] <wa5ted> Novus3013: ajpiano is a legend
[03:28:03] <Novus3013> ~/.bashrc has no alias?
[03:28:04] <wa5ted> he doesnt exist
[03:28:25] <Novus3013> And one more question if it's empty ~/.bashrc
[03:29:29] <Novus3013> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJN_zHfMozw
[03:30:05] <Novus3013> Here is I've got the emptied Notebook with virus, had to hangout the iptables-rules
[03:30:31] <Novus3013> ~ again
[03:35:39] <Novus3013> Yo, people, I know that all of you are together are congratulate each other but I've got a question with 2 minutes
[03:36:20] <Novus3013> I work on Wordpress and of course there is (function($))......(jQuery) question? Fro 2 minutes
[03:37:06] <HansWurst> wa5ted: i want to read the data-* attribute of the selected li-element in the selected/unselected-event
[03:38:05] <Novus3013> Hans, what the question is about? Maybe I'll help
[03:38:28] <Novus3013> Maybe .on in improvements?
[03:38:34] <Novus3013> Or .bind()?
[03:40:31] <Novus3013> Ok, Hans what is your question?
[03:41:04] <wa5ted> HansWurst: thats not hard
[03:41:08] <wa5ted> HansWurst: there must be a on completed selection event
[03:41:15] <wa5ted> you jsut return the elements selected in an array
[03:43:03] <Novus3013> $(document).find('#form li').each(function(el){ if($this.hasClass("active")) array_push(msg, $this.attr("data"))});
[03:43:50] <Novus3013> Don't know which el or if jQuery supports the array_push, try to create Array and then just to ar.push
[03:44:30] <Novus3013> I'm going to see the queue of messages and then will be again from 15 mins later
[03:44:43] <Novus3013> ^_^
[03:44:56] <printForever> looking to change the input type=checkbox to checked with jQ
[03:45:37] <arthurvr> $('.myCheckbox').prop('checked', true);
[03:45:43] <Novus3013> Are you on the same topic talking? Don't know...
[03:48:56] <printForever> arthurvr, and false will remove it?
[03:49:24] <arthurvr> of course, printForever
[03:49:38] <printForever> :) tnx
[03:50:19] <Novus3013> Look, do you have an experience with some plugin? I've got the question on how to wrap the Factory pattern
[03:50:23] <Novus3013> {}
[03:51:17] <Novus3013> >>> console of opera saies that it's very often got the error in console
[03:51:52] <Novus3013> Aga, here goes my teammate - I'll talk to him, where is my 2Mb plugin?
[03:51:55] <Novus3013> %)
[04:02:28] <Chulbul> how to convert 6,912 into integer format, I used parseInt but it returns only 6. I want to be 6912
[04:02:48] <Chulbul> how to convert 6,912 into integer format, I used parseInt but it returns only 6. I want it to be 6912
[04:04:43] <Novus3013> maybe math.gsub?
[04:05:06] <hagb4rd> chulbul.. you could convert it to a string .. replace the comma with "".. and convert to integer again
[04:06:24] <arthurvr> exactly: Number(String(6.912).replace('.', ''))
[04:07:42] <Chulbul> ok :)
[04:12:32] <Novus3013> Ok, I'll show you a sniipet, wait?
[04:12:50] <HansWurst> Novus3013, wa5ted: i want to use the event "selected" of https://github.com/anovi/selectonic
[04:13:24] <wa5ted> HansWurst: yup
[04:13:28] <wa5ted> so what you want to do
[04:13:44] <wa5ted> is use ui.items
[04:13:48] <wa5ted> withe seected event
[04:13:50] <wa5ted> run a foreach
[04:13:54] <wa5ted> and get the data-* from it
[04:14:50] <wa5ted> HansWurst: good?
[04:15:28] <Novus3013> Sorry, I didn't use selectonic, so the main idea that when the wrappers inside are created
[04:15:49] <Novus3013> You can add class on fly to them and then parse as I've said
[04:16:47] <wa5ted> Novus3013: i gave him a solution
[04:16:53] <wa5ted> you canuse the internal events
[04:17:52] <rzeka> How can I use easing in animations? I've got wish.animate({top: top}, 'slow', 'easeoutback'); but it doesn't work :(
[04:19:56] <Novus3013> Maybe you should adjust the easing library
[04:19:58] <Novus3013> ?
[04:20:00] <Novus3013> ??
[04:20:02] <Novus3013> ?!
[04:20:45] <scrieler> hi, can anybody tell me how I can do this effect reversely? http://wowslider.com/jquery-gallery-dot-seven-demo.html
[04:21:12] <HansWurst> thx, i got it :)
[04:24:06] <Novus3013> When you generate the slider, please look at the some pimps in the programm, because they have very intensive coordinats, maybe flat-squares style, or smth?
[04:24:32] <Novus3013> I mean use styles, another, then just adopt
[04:24:35] <Novus3013> )
[04:24:36] <wa5ted> rzeka: i beleive easing options are limited to swing and linear by default
[04:24:56] <wa5ted> rzeka: http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[04:25:25] <wa5ted> scrieler: you mean the transitions
[04:25:30] <Novus3013> http://jsfiddle.net/Novus3013/sd34tash/
[04:25:57] <Novus3013> DOesn't work, could you wa5ted to look?

[04:28:13] <wa5ted> Novus3013: do you ever read your console
[04:28:19] <Novus3013> Arh, didn't want to paste here, where is my phone dir? Aha, here, sorry for the link - I didn't

[04:31:00] <wa5ted> its a work week so
[04:32:22] <Novus3013> I understand, let's try later, I'll be here, sometimes looking to monitor, so currently will be doing another stuff and of course when everything is ready I'll shutdown the alptop
[04:32:24] <Novus3013> laptop
[04:32:33] <Novus3013> 20.00 +2GMT
[04:37:13] <scrieler> wa5ted: I want to do this transition outside the page into a fullsize image
[04:41:06] <Novus3013> Ok, the console saies that it has the not write syntax and maybe it's somehow if not compiling because it uses the not wright wrapper, firstly I use the wrapper of function(factory){} then goes internal code and then again the function($) and I've added the (jQuery, factory) below the all code
[04:41:31] <Novus3013> I'll duplicate the question on 14 by Greenwich
[04:41:57] <Novus3013> The syntax error something with the strict mode or similar
[04:42:02] <Novus3013> I don't know
[04:45:02] <Francis> Hey i need some help
[04:45:17] <Francis> $("#cart ol:first ").find("#text1").change("#text"+i).removeClass("module_nam").addClass("module_name").append($scope.name);
[04:45:44] <Francis> with the help of find functio i can find the id and change its class
[04:46:11] <Francis> i want that when i find the class i want to replace the id
[04:46:14] <Francis> like
[04:46:26] <Francis> #text1 with #text5
[04:46:37] <Francis> plz any one sort out this one
[04:47:54] <shoky> $('#text1').prop('id', 'text5')
[04:48:26] <Francis> shoky : ok wait i use this one
[04:57:30] <Francis> shoky thanks it's work
[05:00:47] <wa5ted> shoky: mind helping me find the scroll used in this page http://www.benoitchalland.com/
[05:03:45] <serengeor> is $(el).html(someHtml); asynchronous?
[05:06:10] <systemfault> no
[05:06:54] <serengeor> systemfault, how come that I can't select an element by id just after doing html(someHtml)
[05:07:35] <systemfault> You should, you have another problem.
[05:08:00] <systemfault> Do you have an example on jsfiddle.net or something?
[05:08:39] <serengeor> systemfault, nope, not sure how I could move that portion of code to jsfiddle
[05:09:30] <systemfault> serengeor: How do you select the element?
[05:09:33] <serengeor> thing is that I am setting ajax response as new html for container and then I can't find the element, but it's all done in success callback
[05:09:35] <systemfault> What method do you use?
[05:09:49] <serengeor> $('#container')
[05:10:32] <Omar-> do it on complete: function () { }
[05:11:05] <systemfault> serengeor: http://jsfiddle.net/90mp4ybm/ works.
[05:12:07] <serengeor> systemfault, well, I know it should work like that
[05:12:13] <serengeor> but it doesn't
[05:13:15] <serengeor> thought maybe .html is somewhat doing async stuff
[05:13:20] <Omar-> http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[05:13:29] <Omar-> complete fires after success/error
[05:14:30] <systemfault> He probably doesn't want the same code to happen on success and on failure...
[05:15:26] <serengeor> yeah, that would be kind of a turndown :D
[05:16:13] <serengeor> if I execute the find in settimeout after 1s for example it finds the element, buf ofc that's not a sollution
[05:17:22] <Omar-> ok
[05:17:30] <systemfault> serengeor: Are you absolutely sure you're doing the logic _inside_ the callback? :/
[05:18:03] <shoky> wa5ted: i dunno, looks like custom code
[05:20:07] <wa5ted> i know, i cant locate it though
[05:20:23] <wa5ted> its buried, im guessing it would be called inertial scrolling?
[05:20:30] <shoky> well, it's minified..
[05:20:36] <serengeor> ok, I think I think I'd like to jump out of my office window right now
[05:21:02] <systemfault> serengeor: Not on a monday ... :/
[05:21:08] <shoky> wa5ted: but you'll see related stuff if you search for translate3d in scripts.js
[05:21:09] <serengeor> did everything right except for the fact that select was in completelly different callback..
[05:21:30] <systemfault> serengeor: Be happy, you fixed your issue.
[05:22:06] <wa5ted> shoky:good idea, i know it was perviously located but i cant find it anymore
[05:23:21] <serengeor> well, thanks for the help.. :)
[05:27:19] <wa5ted> shoky:cant find anything scroll related
[05:28:09] <shoky> wa5ted: this._y = this.body.scrollTop()
[05:28:21] <shoky> wa5ted: Normalize.transform(this.wrapper[0], "translate3d(0, -" + this.wrapper.y + "px,0)");
[05:28:40] <shoky> wa5ted: etc. etc. etc.  go buy the book "how to read minified JS"
[05:33:24] <FilipNortic> shoky: is that a real book?
[05:34:38] <shoky> no ;]
[05:35:10] <wa5ted> lol
[06:08:42] <Novus3013> Ok, wa5ted, are you here, I see some play on the screen here it is, but when I use the mouse event it's some kind moving
[06:09:05] <Novus3013> I'll show that's the released topic, not on your topic
[06:09:26] <wa5ted> stop pinging me
[06:09:30] <wa5ted> ask the general jquery channel
[06:10:49] <Novus3013> http://jsfiddle.net/Novus3013/nx1uj0gf/3/
[06:11:12] <Novus3013> Here it goes, so when the last line is hovered it goes up
[06:12:06] <Novus3013> Ok, don't mind)))))))
[06:13:35] <Novus3013> Ok, can someone change the nick? I see that oksushi is the real player
[06:13:41] <Novus3013> Is it?
[06:16:18] <Novus3013> Can someone help me with some task on jQuery with some Pattern which I don't understand?
[06:17:40] <Novus3013> Ah, sorry, wa5ted, that was not to ping you but something misunderstood
[06:17:54] <Novus3013> I've clicked where are you
[06:18:49] <wa5ted> god 1) make sure what you are saying fucking makes sense 2) badger all you want dont ping people
[06:39:16] <Eckyecky> Hi, my IDE says this is inefficient jquery usage: $("#user-follow button").... anyone know why?
[06:39:41] <arthurvr> what IDE if I may ask?
[06:39:51] <Eckyecky> phpstorm
[06:40:15] <arthurvr> It isn’t invalid jQuery or invalid javascript, but maybe it says that because you aren’t caching selectors or so?
[06:40:42] <Eckyecky> ?
[06:40:57] <arthurvr> Is it this case? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12674591/inefficient-jquery-usage-warnings-in-phpstorm-ide
[06:41:24] <Eckyecky> no, that's not like my example
[06:41:30] <Eckyecky> $("#user-follow button")
[06:41:52] <arthurvr> Yeah but what are you doing with that selector?
[06:42:36] <arthurvr> nothing?
[06:42:40] <effortDee> im trying to use touchSwipe here: http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/demos/Trigger_handlers.html so that after say 100px the action will make you go down or left or right, depending on which way you go but having difficulties with it, anyone used it before?
[06:42:41] <Eckyecky> a click event is attached, but that doesn't matter, it's the way I select the element that is inefficient
[06:43:19] <effortDee> im trying to hold off the swipe until 100px has happened
[06:43:27] <dorei> hello, are there any examples on how to use jquery in a seperate file and not as part of the html?
[06:43:44] <shoky> Eckyecky: in recent jquery and browser versions the difference is negligible and could be even faster in some cases to keep that selector.  (it wants you to use $("#user-follow").find("button") )
[06:43:44] <arthurvr> Eckyecky: It just prefers $("#user-follow").find("button")
[06:44:01] <arthurvr> because than it can use querySelector
[06:44:04] <arthurvr> which is more performant
[06:44:56] <Eckyecky> hm
[06:51:40] <v0id3d> good day guys, I am just wondering can someone point me to a good tutorial on AJAX in jquery to stop page reloads?
[06:52:01] <cjohnson> always start with the documentation: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[06:52:06] <v0id3d> yea i did
[06:52:21] <arthurvr>  Nah. learn.jquery.com is mostly a more beginner-friendly starting point
[06:52:31] <v0id3d> thanks
[06:52:57] <cjohnson> v0id3d: which part were you stuck on?
[06:53:03] <cjohnson> it has several examples
[06:53:21] <v0id3d> yes i am now on learn.jquery.com -=)
[06:53:24] <v0id3d> thanks a lot
[06:55:20] <arthurvr> you’re welcome!
[07:15:08] <neuromute9> Hey folks, if I do var array = parent.find('img.videoThumbnailHidden'); and it returns an array of images, why then can I not do array[0].show() ?
[07:15:26] <neuromute9> I get a Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[07:15:55] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: It's a jQuery collection, not a full on array.
[07:16:05] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: You can do .eq(0).show()
[07:16:37] <neuromute9> ah, ok, thank you! =)
[07:16:44] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:25:00] <neuromute9> BillCriswell, how can I check if a collection item exists?  eg collection.eq(100) ?
[07:25:35] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: You can use .length
[07:25:52] <neuromute9> once again, thank you!
[07:30:45] <BillCriswell> No problem at all
[07:39:10] <pothepanda> hi, can anyone look here and tell me why the select menu is not updating everytime its value is changed? http://pastebin.com/LUEZMeSW
[07:42:40] <Omar-> pothepanda are you using jquery mobile?
[07:43:08] <pothepanda> uhm.. i hope not :D
[07:43:44] <pothepanda> jquery-1.10.2.js
[07:44:16] <Omar-> maybe you need to call refresh after appending/selecting options programmatically
[07:44:24] <Omar-> .selectmenu("refresh")
[07:45:49] <pothepanda> oh there is something wrong with the includes anyway :/
[07:48:10] <pothepanda> what happens is it works only on 1st time. then it does not update ? :/
[07:48:23] <pothepanda> tried the refresh, didnt work
[08:09:10] <beepbeepbeep_> I'm sending a get request with ajax but am getting a 304 response, however, the content IS modified. How can I force it to not use browser cache?
[08:09:23] <toothe> is bootstrap a competitor of jquery or a competitor of jquery UI ?
[08:09:24] <toothe> or both?
[08:09:33] <beepbeepbeep_> toothe, not at all
[08:09:34] <BillCriswell> Neither.
[08:09:37] <beepbeepbeep_> bootstrap is a css framework.
[08:09:44] <BillCriswell> with jQuery plugins.
[08:09:59] <toothe> ahh, so it leverages jquery...okay
[08:10:07] <toothe> because I've gotten somewhat far with jquery
[08:10:56] <toothe> does freenode have a bootstrap channel? ##bootstrap is #idle.
[08:11:48] <BillCriswell> ##bootstrap is the only one I know of.
[08:12:21] <BillCriswell> Just did a /list and searched for bootstrap and that's the most populated one by far.
[08:41:04] <pentagrass> If I use ajax.always() is there a possibility that the ajax request would not finish before the always function is called?
[08:41:25] <pentagrass> or does it block until complete then execute what's in the always() func?
[08:42:17] <robertmaxrees> nothing is blocking - the callbacks passed are only called when the deferred is resolved or rejected.
[08:43:01] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: so there is never a time when the ajax call will get interrupted by a call to always()? Because in my always() callback, I'm submitting a form
[08:43:12] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.always/
[08:43:36] <robertmaxrees> the docs make it pretty clear :) .always() only gets called when the deferred is resolved or rejected, like AJAX for instance.
[08:43:43] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: thank you!
[09:19:36] <cartsar> hello, could anyone offer a js noob some advice on how to restructure this? http://jsbin.com/pacegutesa/1/edit?html,output Thanks!
[09:19:37] <cartsar> I need to get my second http request off of the main thread.
[09:19:45] <Rayne> I have a form, which should be only submittable with at least two values. This is my first jQuery code and I would like to know how you would improve it. http://jsfiddle.net/4m84Lsq1/1/
[09:21:09] <BinaryKitten> Rayne - no problem
[09:23:14] <robertmaxrees> cartsar that doesn't look valid to me.
[09:23:35] <NoiseEee> Rayne: one easy improvement would be making your "a_id" stuff jquery objects
[09:24:33] <cartsar> robertmaxrees: It is running without error (asside from the depreciation error). what part looks invalid to you?
[09:24:51] <robertmaxrees> the unclosed curly for the beforesend option.
[09:24:57] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't look invalid, it IS invalid.
[09:26:06] <robertmaxrees> also, what you want to do is pass a callback to getCustomer() that gets run within its .done()
[09:26:38] <cartsar> robertmaxrees: you are correct, that error was an accident when copy and pating my code over.
[09:26:41] <robertmaxrees> instead of turning off async
[09:27:34] <cartsar> robertmaxrees: ok that makes sense, javascript seems like an endless trail of call backs some times
[09:28:33] <robertmaxrees> you can get into callback hell, but there are some good ways to manage that.
[09:28:40] <robertmaxrees> especially when it comes to async code.
[09:29:51] <joeyDB> ES7 should really help out with async problems i hear
[09:30:05] <cartsar> ES7?
[09:30:09] <joeyDB> yeah
[09:30:11] <robertmaxrees> ecmascript 7
[09:30:21] <joeyDB> ^ that
[09:30:47] <robertmaxrees> and aye, though I live in a world where i can't take much advantage of even ES6 features
[09:31:08] <joeyDB> robertmaxrees: stop playin, we all know you live in the future
[09:31:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha i wish.
[09:31:31] <joeyDB> communicating to use through IRC like its a ham radio ala that "frequency" movie
[09:31:40] <joeyDB> hahaha
[09:32:24] <BinaryKitten> Rayne still here?
[09:32:32] <Rayne> BinaryKitten, yes, working on an update
[09:32:57] <BinaryKitten> what's with the prop required parts
[09:33:54] <BinaryKitten> Rayne - http://jsfiddle.net/4m84Lsq1/2/
[09:35:20] <NoiseEee> holy santa claus BinaryKitten
[09:35:28] <BinaryKitten> NoiseEee?
[09:35:30] <NoiseEee> just givin stuff away!
[09:40:56] <Rayne> BinaryKitten, it took some minutes but I like your idea :-)
[09:41:04] <Rayne> Thank you BinaryKitten
[09:46:02] <axilla> afternoon all, I have this code here https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/41989f4bec0272e20857 which allows me to select thumbnails of an instagram feed and import them into our system.  I want to enable the ability to press and hold shift and select two assets and also select all the ones in between.  Anyone have a good read or idea on how to implement this?
[09:47:15] <robertmaxrees> errr, isthat legit?
[09:47:25] <robertmaxrees> like, is IG okay with you downloading images like that?
[09:47:33] <axilla> of course
[09:47:37] <axilla> they provide it via their api
[09:47:41] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[09:47:52] <axilla> the users have given us permission
[09:48:06] <robertmaxrees> either way, you'd have to detect if the shift keydown event has happened, but not the keyup evenyt.
[09:48:13] <axilla> right.
[09:48:20] <robertmaxrees> if so, handle your clicks differently.
[09:48:21] <BillCriswell> axilla: Get the of the one you clicked second and if shift was being held use .slice() to grab the ones.
[09:48:31] <axilla> ahhh yea
[09:48:36] <NoiseEee> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5731898/select-multiple-images-from-a-grid-of-thumbnail-images
[09:48:43] <axilla> thanks bill, thats a good way to do it.
[09:48:48] <BillCriswell> I think I've coded this before trying to do gmails interface for fun.
[09:49:20] <NoiseEee> the method in that SO answer is interesting too
[09:49:51] <axilla> yea, erm.. we just had a trial customer manually select 1000 images.. i felt really bad that i didnt implement this before.. but during coding I didnt have a instagram account before, so i took like 20 photos and worked with that.. didnt think about the user with 5k photos.. lol
[09:51:00] <pyCasso> I need help! I am trying to execute code AFTER a twitter iframe has loaded completely.
[09:51:04] <BillCriswell> Now I need to try it.
[09:51:09] <pyCasso> I am using $('iframe.twitter-timeline').onload(function(){...execute my functions now...});
[09:51:29] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso you want .load() iirc.
[09:52:42] <axilla> NoiseEee: what i already have is pretty much whats in that stackoverflow
[09:52:51] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: can't happen due to XCORS
[09:53:02] <axilla> my code does exactly that.
[09:53:08] <NoiseEee> axilla: sweet
[09:53:08] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso then you're kind of SOL...
[09:53:20] <axilla> NoiseEee: i'm adding the ability to shift click and select multiples with just 2 clicks.
[09:53:29] <axilla> so i don't have to manually click click click zz.z .
[09:53:36] <pyCasso> im using jquery to restyle the twitter widget. robertmaxrees
[09:53:36] <NoiseEee> ahhh i see, i misunderstood axilla
[09:53:41] <axilla> no worries :)
[09:53:55] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso you can't access it at all if CORS is an issue.
[09:53:55] <axilla> bill gave me exactly what i needed
[09:53:57] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of SOL
[09:55:58] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: what jquery methods is used to execute code after all page elements have loaded? or is there an iframe listener method?
[09:56:10] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso .load() is used for that.
[09:56:26] <robertmaxrees> $(window).load(); is for all assets.
[09:56:53] <robertmaxrees> but if CORS is an issue, you're going to have a helluva time restyling anything via JS
[09:58:26] <pyCasso> well the script i wrote will work as intended. It grabs the dom elements from the loaded iframe ( twitter widget ) and appends it into a new dom element within my page.
[09:58:46] <BillCriswell> axilla: http://jsbin.com/wiceverete/1/edit?css,js,output weee
[09:58:55] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: however, this only happens when i manually paste the code into console
[10:02:50] <robertmaxrees> wait, then cors isn't an issue.
[10:03:02] <BillCriswell> duh, I overcomplicated that sorting.
[10:03:09] <robertmaxrees> .load() should work just fine, pyCasso
[10:17:35] <axilla> BillCriswell: it only works if i select from bottom up but close!
[10:17:56] <axilla> that gives me a good idea on how to do it
[10:19:10] <axilla> just remove the && lastIndex
[10:21:36] <axilla> it works great nice!
[10:32:38] <BillCriswell> axilla: Worked either way here
[10:35:13] <BillCriswell> axilla: Ah, duh, fucking up when index was 0 cause of that.
[10:35:15] <BillCriswell> Noob.
[10:35:19] <mvpgraff> Has anybody worked with http://gridster.net/ ?
[10:35:20] <BillCriswell> Me
[10:35:40] <mvpgraff> Ok, I keep getting Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function on .gridster();
[10:35:51] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/wiceverete/2/edit?js,output there we go
[10:36:14] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: Are you sure the plugin is included in the page?
[10:36:24] <mvpgraff> Yea, everything is included
[10:36:53] <BillCriswell> Are you including the plugin after you include jQuery?
[10:37:07] <mvpgraff> First error is this: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaults' of undefined on line 47 of the jquery.gridster.js
[10:37:17] <mvpgraff> Then I get the undefined error
[10:37:34] <BillCriswell> Oh, well there you go haha
[10:39:19] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: Did you include jquery draggable?
[10:39:42] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/442
[10:41:53] <BillCriswell> That's weird. Can't get a "shift" key on a change event.
[10:43:47] <mvpgraff> BillCriswell <3
[10:43:56] <mvpgraff> I was loading everything after gridster.js
[10:44:20] <mvpgraff> Didn't realize it needed to be before...
[10:45:08] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: Happens.
[10:47:08] <mvpgraff> Should really add that to the documentation before people pull their hairs out trying to figure it out lol...
[10:48:35] <BillCriswell> Yeah it is definitely not obvious reading the documentation.
[10:49:34] <BillCriswell> Doesn't mention jQuery UI or anything on that page
[10:50:03] <teamcoltra> How do I run a function when there are broken images? I know I have had it working in the past but it doesn't seem to be this time... http://jsfiddle.net/utybu5go/2/
[10:50:21] <BillCriswell> 249 open issues isn't exactly a good sign mvpgraff.
[10:52:11] <robertmaxrees> teamcoltra that only works if the binding happens before the event fires.
[10:52:32] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/error/
[10:54:03] <teamcoltra> robertmaxrees that makes sense as in my code I put js at the bottom of the page, JS fiddle must put it up top
[10:54:35] <BillCriswell> Yeah, have to choose "No wrap - in <body>" from that dropdown.
[10:55:13] <mvpgraff> BillCriswell yea, especially from a New Relic company... lol
[11:00:54] <alexclark> does anyone have tips on debugging scroll jitter?
[11:01:39] <spudzee> How do I get the distance between the mouse pointer to the top of the viewport, and the distance between the mouse and the left of the viewport?
[11:02:44] <spudzee> something like var mousetop = 300 and var mouseleft = 500 ?
[11:03:13] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/7790764/923919
[11:08:05] <BillCriswell> spudzee: substract the scrollTop of body from event.pageY
[11:08:59] <spudzee> this function you linked is very interesting...
[11:09:44] <BillCriswell> Oh, didn't even click that haha.
[11:09:52] <BillCriswell> At least I was on the right track.
[11:14:10] <spudzee> I love and hate it when there's already a huge function available somewhere on the internet to do exactly what I want
[11:14:56] <mvpgraff> That is a nice link.
[11:15:05] <spudzee> I love it because it makes my job easier; I hate it because I usually have no idea how the function works, which makes it difficult to understand how to use it.
[11:15:27] <mvpgraff> read the function out loud
[11:15:29] <mvpgraff> : p
[11:15:44] <BillCriswell> spudzee: Don't use it till you understand what it's doing.
[11:15:45] <spudzee> rubber ducky debugging ftw
[11:16:04] <Miles8of9> in json, what does [ and ] mean? object?
[11:16:16] <robertmaxrees> array
[11:16:40] <LindsayMac> OMG.. for the record, you want to go and refresh your permalinks when working with queryvars FYI
[11:16:46] <LindsayMac> y'all
[11:17:01] <Miles8of9> i did json_encode (php) of an array and i got { and }
[11:17:13] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 that's an object.
[11:17:24] <robertmaxrees> dunno what PHP is doing wrong.
[11:17:25] <mvpgraff> LindsayMac I think you meant #wordpress?
[11:17:27] <Miles8of9> O_O
[11:17:30] <LindsayMac> OOS! LOL
[11:17:32] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 show the output.
[11:18:24] <spudzee> I'm just gonna guess something funny is happening right now
[11:18:32] <spudzee> "hahahaha"
[11:18:42] <Miles8of9> http://pastie.org/9794700
[11:19:02] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 that's pretty funny.  that's an object whose properties are all numbers.
[11:19:24] <robertmaxrees> which is technically what an array is, but not like that.
[11:19:32] <spudzee> "lol", ":P", "XD", .... etc....
[11:19:45] <Miles8of9> -_-
[11:20:43] <Miles8of9> i would like to read the list from a jquery autocomplete
[11:20:57] <robertmaxrees> you need to get PHP to generate the correct data structure first.
[11:21:49] <Miles8of9> indeed >_>
[11:22:53] <mvpgraff> Lol, I had to work with a product json feed for magento that had over 200k products. Was fun.
[11:23:14] <robertmaxrees> oh magento
[11:23:34] <mvpgraff> I'm still getting weird errors every once in a while...
[11:23:49] <robertmaxrees> we tried to move to it and ditched it.
[11:23:53] <mvpgraff> I think I don't have enough server space anymore and it won't load anymore product images...
[11:24:25] <spudzee> I love it when I see some function where the majority of the code is directed to getting it to work with IE. It's like, do people even use that browser any more?
[11:24:36] <robertmaxrees> spudzee yep.
[11:24:39] <robertmaxrees> it's still very popular.
[11:24:47] <spudzee> gosh
[11:24:54] <robertmaxrees> also: I have fewer issues with IE than I do with chrome ;)
[11:25:04] <mvpgraff> ^
[11:25:20] <robertmaxrees> also also: jquery has more fixes in core for webkit/blink than any other browser.
[11:25:31] <robertmaxrees> or at least that was the case.
[11:25:39] <NoiseEee> welcome to the 'open weblol'
[11:25:43] <robertmaxrees> D:
[11:25:59] <arthurvr> welcome to cross-browser hell
[11:26:00] <spudzee> http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp It's a bit optimistic to see that the percentage of people using IE is at least going down
[11:26:14] <robertmaxrees> w3schools is terrible.
[11:26:17] <robertmaxrees> don't use them for anything.
[11:26:20] <arthurvr> w3fools.com
[11:26:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:26:29] <mvpgraff> ^
[11:26:35] <spudzee> okay fine
[11:26:43] <spudzee> can I at least use their stats?
[11:26:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:26:46] <arthurvr> But IE8 is slightly dying these days
[11:26:48] <arthurvr> nope!
[11:26:49] <spudzee> oh god
[11:27:04] <robertmaxrees> you can't trust w3schools ;)
[11:27:13] <mvpgraff> Go into PHP and ask how good w3schools is good to learn.
[11:27:46] <arthurvr> everything on w3schools is just terrible
[11:28:17] <spudzee> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers I do trust wikipedia though
[11:28:27] <spudzee> even if those statistics might be taken directly from the previous source :(
[11:28:36] <arthurvr> wikipedia is okay, but there are better sources
[11:28:43] <spudzee> like what?
[11:28:43] <robertmaxrees> I wouldn't trust any particular list, especially because those lists don't have the one metric you actually care about.
[11:28:52] <arthurvr> current IE8 stats:
[11:28:53] <arthurvr> W3Counter: 2.57% (November 2014)
[11:28:54] <arthurvr> Clicky: 2.41% (today)
[11:28:54] <arthurvr> Statcounter: %4.93 (December)
[11:29:14] <arthurvr> which is IMO still to much
[11:29:26] <spudzee> we need to burn the IE heathens!
[11:29:39] <robertmaxrees> or let them be and keep making money off them ;)
[11:29:42] <arthurvr> can’t we just buy all IE users a new computer?
[11:29:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:29:56] <spudzee> buy them a macbook ffs
[11:30:00] <arthurvr> haha
[11:30:00] <robertmaxrees> the problem with those stats is they don't tell you anything about YOUR users.
[11:30:03] <robertmaxrees> and nothx
[11:30:11] <arthurvr> of course
[11:30:34] <arthurvr> you should always look at stats of similiar sites
[11:30:42] <arthurvr> or the same sites ;-)
[11:30:51] <spudzee> It took me SO long to convert my mother to chrome
[11:30:51] <robertmaxrees> not in my case ;)
[11:30:57] <robertmaxrees> or install google analytics and get your own data.
[11:31:06] <arthurvr> of course
[11:32:14] <spudzee> she was like "chrome is slow". Yeah, mom, I'm pretty sure it's microsoft's doing not chrome's. Making every other browser slow, freakin microsoft
[11:32:21] <robertmaxrees> actually...
[11:32:37] <robertmaxrees> chrome cheats and can slow down the entire system because of the way they issue their interrupts iirc.
[11:33:13] <robertmaxrees> it's not MS' fault
[11:33:30] <Rayne> Is there a fix (without overwriting the behaviour of submit buttons or enter/return keys) for the missing "tab to next input"-button on mobiles?
[11:33:40] <spudzee> Last time I used a window 8 machine, trying to install chrome from IE was a nightmare
[11:33:52] <robertmaxrees> spudzee really?  because on my wife's machine it was a breeze.
[11:33:55] <robertmaxrees> download -> install.  done.
[11:34:11] <nikio__> robertmaxrees, i talked to a young guy on webdev and im in the process of improving my code, instead of using jquery to generate Todoitem html i use templates
[11:34:11] <spudzee> IE kept alerting me saying,"IE is faster than chrome see the stats"
[11:34:20] <nikio__> ejs to be exact
[11:34:29] <robertmaxrees> spudzee that's actually correct ;)
[11:34:39] <robertmaxrees> IE11 outperforms chrome in many areas.
[11:34:49] <spudzee> I don't care.
[11:34:58] <robertmaxrees> it's also generally more compliant.
[11:35:01] <spudzee> Chrome is the king of browsers
[11:35:02] <nikio__> robertmaxrees, ie11 is the most efficient browser of all
[11:35:08] <robertmaxrees> spudzee i disagree.
[11:35:16] <nikio__> many tests confirm, and it also loads instantly on windows
[11:35:35] <nikio__> takes less ram etc
[11:35:39] <spudzee> it doesn't matter how fast it loads your website. That is functionally irrelevant
[11:35:58] <robertmaxrees> "chrome is the kind of browsers" is a valid statement how, then?
[11:36:21] <CssNoob> good morning and good night y'all :|
[11:36:33] <spudzee> what matters is the external software you can run on it (eg extensions, apps, etc)
[11:36:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd still disagree.
[11:36:44] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[11:37:01] <Macaba_> I'm getting this from php ::: {"Result":"OK","Options":["3","2","5","4"]}
[11:37:01] <arthurvr> nah. What percentage of ur users use extensions or apps?
[11:37:17] <Macaba_> how ccan I set in a dropdown list jtable
[11:37:18] <Macaba_> {"Result":"OK","Options":["3","2","5","4"]}
[11:37:23] <Macaba_> http://www.jtable.org/ApiReference/FieldOptions#fopt-options
[11:37:28] <Macaba_> this is the documentation
[11:37:31] <spudzee> I use lots of extensions and apps
[11:37:40] <robertmaxrees> spudzee so chrome better fits your use case.
[11:37:42] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[11:37:52] <teamcoltra> Okay so I have my code working but I am wondering if this is an issue with jsfiddle or there is something I can do to make my javascript fire properly? If I put the JS into the body  (either before or after the affected element) it loads fine. If I put it into their javascript section, it fails to load. It's also doing the same thing on my website, where if I put it into the template itself wrapped in <script> tags it works, but if I put it into
[11:37:52] <teamcoltra>  my.js file it fails to load. http://jsfiddle.net/u01v27a4/2/
[11:38:00] <robertmaxrees> Macaba_ you'll have to transform your data to fit what that plugin expects.
[11:38:59] <robertmaxrees> teamcoltra http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u01v27a4/3/
[11:39:03] <robertmaxrees> is this working correctly?
[11:39:06] <Macaba_> transform to ?
[11:39:15] <robertmaxrees> Macaba_ the format they're expecting.
[11:39:20] <teamcoltra> robertmaxrees yes
[11:39:21] <spudzee> smooth scrolling and alientube are some examples of extensions I use. Apps are workflowy, google keep, and pocket
[11:39:28] <teamcoltra> Did you do anything different?
[11:39:35] <spudzee> okay, I'm gonna drop it now
[11:39:39] <robertmaxrees> teamcoltra yes - see the "onLoad" dropdown?
[11:39:57] <robertmaxrees> spudzee you're saying "i like it so it must be better" ;)
[11:40:46] <Guest45657> is it still not possible to listen to $(location).attr('href') change
[11:41:04] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't fire an event.
[11:41:05] <spudzee> yes, it's more custom enabled and that makes it better IMO
[11:41:15] <robertmaxrees> spudzee *better for your use case ;)
[11:41:16] <spudzee> but if IE works for you.... whatever
[11:41:25] <robertmaxrees> I use FF because I prefer its workflow for development.
[11:42:34] <spudzee> why is better for dev stuff? Just curious not judging
[11:43:03] <robertmaxrees> i prefer the way the dev tools look and are layed out.  the dark dev edition colors are more pleasing to my eyes.
[11:43:09] <robertmaxrees> more comfortable with them overall.
[11:43:20] <arthurvr> you can install dark themes to chrome devtools too btw
[11:43:26] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[11:43:26] <DroneX> GM
[11:43:33] <arthurvr> (but I agree it’s just a personal preference)
[11:43:34] <spudzee> I've never really attempted to use FF. I'll give it a go one day
[11:43:43] <robertmaxrees> i've tried, I still prefer the FF dev edition look/feel.
[11:44:16] <arthurvr> ok. Everybody has its preferences
[11:44:21] <robertmaxrees> eeexactly.
[11:44:29] <DroneX> FF is best for dev
[11:44:37] <robertmaxrees> *in your opinion ;)
[11:44:43] <DroneX> Yes
[11:44:44] <robertmaxrees> and we'll leave it at that :D
[11:44:45] <arthurvr> No, It’s a personal preference.
[11:44:52] <arthurvr> let’s do that.
[11:44:53] <robertmaxrees> that's what i mean.
[11:45:12] <robertmaxrees> in your opinion/your personal preference/however else you want to phrase it.
[11:45:43] <DroneX> Dev best prefere ff
[11:46:03] <robertmaxrees> leeeet's just drop it now.
[11:46:15] <spudzee> every carbon based life form with a similar genome to mine has their own 'preference'... sure....
[11:46:20] <DroneX> Especially if you're a old school linux user
[11:46:30] <robertmaxrees> anyway - how's everybody's monday going?
[11:46:59] <spudzee> unproductive..
[11:47:30] <arthurvr> mine superproductive
[11:47:42] <spudzee> I'm already 1/14 the way through the week, and I haven't made any progress on anything :((
[11:48:00] <arthurvr> than stop hanging out here and get on working.
[11:48:04] <arthurvr> ;)
[11:48:13] <spudzee> you know what?!?!?!!?? I will
[11:49:13] <arthurvr> spudzee: have fun
[11:50:12] <mvpgraff> Oh how is the ff dev version?
[11:50:18] <mvpgraff> I've been wanting to try it
[11:50:21] <robertmaxrees> I like it.
[11:50:29] <arthurvr> quite nice
[11:50:36] <mvpgraff> hmm gotta make the switch then.
[11:50:38] <robertmaxrees> lots of tools i don't touch, but the core stuff feels really nice.
[11:51:04] <mvpgraff> Yea, I used to use FF then it started hogging about 2gb of my resources (too many tabs)
[11:51:19] <robertmaxrees> dev edition isn't any different in that regard btw.
[11:51:43] <mvpgraff> Hmmmm... but do I want to deal with how bad chrome has been lately?
[11:52:13] <mvpgraff> Nope, not really, I'll just keep my tabs minimal...
[11:52:36] <arthurvr> mvpgraff: do you mean canary has been bad?
[11:52:47] <arthurvr> or are you talking about the dev channel?
[11:52:52] <arthurvr> or beta?
[11:56:46] <teamcoltra> Okay here is my site http://testing.tuebl.ca/browse/new (it's around line 340 when you look at source) and here is a test on JS fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/u01v27a4/6/ which is set to ondomready like robertmaxrees set it to but domready is already set in the script too.
[11:56:59] <teamcoltra> Oh sorry the problem is it's working in JSFiddle, but not my site
[12:00:15] <robertmaxrees> let's back up - what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[12:02:39] <arthurvr> I just joined, so that might be handy to know :)
[12:03:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:04:45] <teamcoltra> robertmaxrees / arthurvr my site has a lot of book covers missing, it was due to a stupid backup error but anyway until we can figure a good way to replace them, I want to update all broken images with the image from the openlibrary api
[12:05:07] <robertmaxrees> why can't you handle that in your backend instead?
[12:05:20] <arthurvr> it’s something for the backend indeed
[12:06:32] <teamcoltra> Of course it's something for the backend, but right now we don't have any time to do it on the backend (I am only frontend, and the whole thing is volunteer) so for a hack-y solution until it's fixed I figured this was the best option
[12:07:10] <arthurvr> It isn’t the best solution for both your end users and for the developers, but I’il take a look.
[12:07:42] <robertmaxrees> Put your code in the <head> - in the doc ready, bind a listener to all <img> tags and their load event
[12:10:04] <teamcoltra> isn't it already listening for the error message? (all my questions are out of ignorance, not trying to be right)
[12:10:27] <robertmaxrees> at the end of the page.
[12:10:34] <robertmaxrees> just tossing out ideas.
[12:10:42] <robertmaxrees> you're going to spend more time dealing with these race conditions tbh.
[12:17:45] <teamcoltra> I have moved it up to the head, down to the bottom directly above the </body>, it already waits for the document to be loaded. The other js works fine. It's crazy
[12:19:54] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have issues no matter what in your case.
[12:20:45] <teamcoltra> Why?
[12:20:50] <robertmaxrees> race conditions.
[12:21:03] <robertmaxrees> there are going to be images that fail before the event binding can attach.
[12:22:02] <teamcoltra> Doesn't it attach ON failure? I am lost.
[12:22:07] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:22:16] <robertmaxrees> event listeners attach to elements that exist.
[12:22:22] <robertmaxrees> the handler FIRES on failure.
[12:25:09] <teamcoltra> http://jsfiddle.net/u01v27a4/7/ this example has far more images than I have, and still succeeds... I even added a bunch of text to simulate the amount of HTML http://jsfiddle.net/u01v27a4/8/ and it still works. I am really dumb with all this stuff, I am starting to get the mechanics but still am failing at theory but it seems like it's handling whatever is thrown at it.
[12:27:53] <darir> teamcoltra: you're not loading jquery
[12:29:45] <darir> not sure if that's already been mentioned.. didn't read up. But seems to be a glaring issue :)
[12:29:47] <teamcoltra> darir if you were seeing the js on top, that's because I was just moving it around to see if it would help. Now it's back where I think it should be.
[12:30:00] <darir> kk
[12:30:36] <teamcoltra> What's the glaring issue?
[12:30:40] <teamcoltra> ohhhh
[12:30:42] <teamcoltra> that was
[12:33:08] <alexclark> can anyone help me debug jittery scrolling in mobile?
[12:41:08] <NoiseEee> http://jankfree.org/ @ alexclark
[12:45:38] <Tomashe> Hey guys anyone knows why that isnt working , its not firing container.on("scroll","#someid",function(){alert(1); });
[12:46:02] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: What element is scrolling?
[12:48:16] <BillCriswell> Also, not sure scroll events bubble
[12:49:35] <Tomashe> some div
[12:49:59] <Tomashe> some div with overflow: scroll
[12:53:20] <Tomashe> so no solution
[12:58:27] <_DB> sup
[12:58:38] <_DB>   url : '/admin/login',  this is part of my ajax  request
[12:58:45] <_DB> was wondering can I point this to a full url?
[12:58:59] <_DB> like http://site.dev/users/update
[13:12:21] <abailarri> Hello. I have a script that created a cookie and reloads tha page. If detects the cookie initiates another portion of code, If not existe, show again the button for create the cookie. Works very fell but I tried in Laravel app and in it not works. Any suggestion please?
[13:29:01] <Tomashe> There is a way to choose 20 divs before specific div?
[13:31:07] <Zzaichik> .revAll()
[13:31:13] <Zzaichik> .prevAll(); maybe?
[13:34:29] <Tomashe> i see
[13:34:31] <Tomashe> let me check
[13:35:03] <Tomashe> i want to choose an element and then select all 20 elements before him
[13:35:06] <Tomashe> but not more then 20
[13:37:29] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[13:37:40] <Tomashe> because thats what i need
[13:37:45] <Tomashe> i have a list of 100 elements
[13:37:52] <Tomashe> 80 are hidden
[13:38:01] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase - that's a very strange thing to want to do.  Is there another way to accomplish what you're looking for?
[13:38:11] <Tomashe> and i need to choose the last visible one and show another 20 before him (chat area)
[13:42:38] <reynierpm1> how do I copy/clone a element in jQuery? Lets say I have something like this <tr class="showOnModal">.....</tr> I want to copy each tr with class .showOnModal and append result to a tbody.Modal, how?
[13:44:39] <robertmaxrees> use .each()
[13:44:53] <robertmaxrees> you can .clone() or use other methods to move things around.
[13:45:51] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees I will made a simple example I never work with clone so I do not know how to give me a few minutes so you can teach me where in my code your suggestion should goes
[13:45:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:46:06] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs first.
[13:46:09] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy.
[13:46:12] <reynierpm1> ok
[14:01:29] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees I need your help|advise take a look here http://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/bfpLqLx9/1/ how to avoid repeat the same elements more than once?
[14:02:16] <reynierpm1> I mean if I click on the button the ones with .showOnModal are clone and append to #selFabricanteBody1 but if I click the button again the process repeat more than once
[14:02:24] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees any advice?
[14:03:29] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways - the easiest would be to append them to a specific container that you always empty before doing your .each()
[14:03:44] <reynierpm1> hmmm let me try that one
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> btw you can do element.each() instead.
[14:05:20] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees I not follow on your last suggestion ¨btw you can do element.each() instead.¨ you mean cloneTr.each() or ....
[14:05:29] <robertmaxrees> I mean instead of $.each()
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> you want to use this: http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:10:13] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees so the right way should be cloneTr.each() ... right?
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> yes
[14:12:40] <reynierpm1> robertmaxrees ok, thanks
[14:24:24] <alexclark> more of a javascript question, but whats the syntax for or equals?
[14:24:38] <AlexR2> a === b || a === c
[14:24:42] <robertmaxrees> yep
[14:25:03] <alexclark> nah i mean x ||= 5
[14:25:09] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> oh for a default value?
[14:25:16] <alexclark> would it just be x = x || 5?
[14:25:24] <robertmaxrees> like when handling undefined?
[14:25:29] <alexclark> yeah
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:25:41] <alexclark> sweet, thanks!
[14:25:51] <AlexR2> be careful because if x is 0, it'll be set to 5
[14:25:57] <AlexR2> or if x is false
[14:26:02] <wa5ted> wait what
[14:26:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ any falsy value
[14:26:12] <robertmaxrees> empty string, 0, null.
[14:26:16] <wa5ted> i thought  === is equals to (with type)
[14:26:16] <AlexR2> var a = 0 || 3; a = 3
[14:26:34] <AlexR2> so even if you meant to have 0, it'll get set to 3
[14:27:00] <AlexR2> wa5ted: was talking about different things, i misunderstood the question
[14:27:27] <wa5ted> kk
[14:33:15] <BeWilled> How do I get the object that triggered the event inside this function? $(".magnify").mousemove(function(e){});
[14:33:26] <robertmaxrees> the this object.
[14:34:19] <robertmaxrees> if you want the jquery-fied version, use $(this)
[16:02:15] <jumpman> What is the 'depth' of this selector? $('.filter :input') - all children of .filter or all children of children of .filter?
[16:02:31] <jumpman> I'm 99% sure it's the latter but that doesn't seem to be what's happening
[16:03:56] <shoky> jumpman: all :input descendants of all .filter's. not just direct children
[16:04:17] <jumpman> Hrm... I wonder where I'm going wrong. /me keeps investigating
[16:04:17] <jumpman> thanks
[16:04:53] <jumpman> Does .changed fire on non-user changes?
[16:05:40] <shoky> what changes, then
[16:07:17] <jumpman> srry let me find the right file xD i didn't author that part
[16:08:31] <jumpman> ah shit... it's meteor reactive. definitely won't fire .changed
[16:09:04] <jumpman> Can I manually call .changed() on an el? xD
[16:09:27] <jumpman> ah, I can. .trigger('changed')
[16:09:31] <jumpman> buahahaha
[16:10:05] <shoky> it's 'change' tho ;p
[16:12:47] <jumpman> wooooooohooo! that did the trick
[17:51:41] <robertmaxrees> so quiet.
[18:02:00] <spudzee> how do 'import' or 'include' this jquery extension JqueryRotate.js ?
[18:02:50] <robertmaxrees> include the script on any page you want to use it on.
[18:03:02] <spudzee> code?
[18:03:02] <robertmaxrees> after jquery, before your own code.
[18:03:10] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:03:30] <spudzee> <script type='text/javascript' src='jQueryRotate.js'></script> this doesn't work
[18:03:39] <robertmaxrees> have you downloaded the file?
[18:03:43] <spudzee> yep
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> and placed it in the same folder as your index?
[18:03:48] <spudzee> yep
[18:03:55] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools - any errors?
[18:03:56] <spudzee> maybe my code is wrong
[18:04:18] <spudzee> no errors that I can see
[18:04:34] <spudzee> ugh... :(
[18:04:35] <robertmaxrees> reload the page with them open.
[18:05:00] <spudzee> okay, so I've included this correctly....
[18:05:15] <spudzee> maybe my code is wrong. Are you familiar with JqueryRotate?
[18:05:16] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab
[18:05:25] <robertmaxrees> any 404s?
[18:05:39] <robertmaxrees> otherwise feel free to make a fiddle.
[18:05:58] <spudzee> no 404s
[18:06:12] <robertmaxrees> and you can see all your files loading correctly?
[18:06:29] <robertmaxrees> if so, feel free to make a fiddle.
[18:06:34] <spudzee> yes.. everything is working javascript wise
[18:06:39] <spudzee> besides .rotate
[18:06:41] <spudzee> $('#red1').rotate();
[18:06:54] <spudzee> that's all... that's what's not happening
[18:07:03] <robertmaxrees> try passing a number.
[18:07:13] <robertmaxrees> you're calling rotate without telling it how much.
[18:07:14] <spudzee> umm... passing a number?
[18:07:32] <spudzee> put a 1 inside it?
[18:07:33] <robertmaxrees> https://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/wiki/Documentation - the .rotate() function defaults to 0.
[18:07:37] <robertmaxrees> try 45
[18:07:46] <robertmaxrees> $('#red1').rotate(45);
[18:08:17] <spudzee> worked
[18:08:27] <robertmaxrees> you just weren't telling it how much to rotate
[18:08:38] <spudzee> man... I really suck at debugging
[18:08:47] <robertmaxrees> just need to read documentation.
[18:08:48] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[18:08:57] <spudzee> lesson learned
[18:09:01] <spudzee> (I think)
[19:06:41] <imfamousirl> how can I wrap an element inside a div on page load
[19:07:27] <imfamousirl> nvm, i think .wrap is it
[19:10:18] <reynierpm1> is this tabsActive.wzSolicitud.compTab1[0] === "true" ? true : false the only workaround to convert a string true|false value to boolean? what about if I have a JSON with several true|false strings and want to use them as bool values? any advice?
[20:47:18] <CssNoob> Good afternoon y'all
[20:49:15] <BillCriswell> CssNoob: Where are you located? Like time-zone wise?
[20:49:58] <CssNoob> Philippines :|
[20:53:54] <imfamousirl> well it is afternoon for most of the world population :D
[20:54:16] <CssNoob> Lol because of work
[21:27:17] <BillCriswell> CssNoob: Haha nice.
[21:27:35] <BillCriswell> Sorry, living room was driving me nuts and I had to clean it.
[21:28:06] <CssNoob> BillCriswell What are you working now?
[21:28:37] <BillCriswell> Have to build a size filter thing for a clients store.
[21:29:03] <CssNoob> you focus more on jquery/javascript?
[21:30:40] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[21:31:49] <CssNoob> So could it be I focus more on CSS?
[21:32:01] <BillCriswell> Haha.. you might?
[21:32:09] <BillCriswell> You'd know that more than me.
[21:32:27] <CssNoob> Just asking because you are more PRO than me.
[21:34:09] <BillCriswell> How can you be sure of that?
[22:34:29] <FLeiXiuS> Why would $('#selector') return an array of 1 element?
[22:34:52] <Nautilus> why wouldn't it?   (jq noob here)
[22:35:21] <FLeiXiuS> I figured DOM selectors are meant to pull only one object.
[22:35:21] <Nautilus> the # means an id, which are unique on a page?
[22:35:32] <FLeiXiuS> That's what I assumed.
[22:36:05] <Nautilus> $('.selector') would return multiples?
[22:42:06] <ussher_> $('#selector') would return the object.
[23:33:40] <arthurvr> Hi everybody!
