[00:03:11] <kevireilly_> tuskkk___: tried the example code from that page? those options might not be optional for it to work
[00:23:25] <White_Cat> ello
[00:24:41] <White_Cat> I am getting this pm [2015-02-06, 09:23:28] <tumtune> show gratis (solo hooy) --> http://<some spam link>
[00:26:23] <snover> sounds amazing
[00:26:36] <Uhkis> :D
[00:26:43] <Xatenev> Morning people
[00:26:44] <slax0r> White_Cat: #freenode and report ;)
[00:26:58] <Uhkis> good day Xatenev
[00:27:01] <White_Cat> okay
[00:27:20] <White_Cat> anyways my real question is jquery in odoo
[00:27:38] <Xatenev> Uhkis: sup boj
[00:27:38] <Xatenev> :p
[00:28:49] <tuskkk___> kevireilly_: even now, it aint, http://jsfiddle.net/Lwko9v1u/1/
[00:29:01] <Uhkis> Xatenev: no idea, go ask some boy :-D
[00:29:12] <slax0r> White_Cat: well, you will have to ask your question then ;)
[00:29:19] <White_Cat> yeah I am compiling
[00:29:28] <Xatenev> Uhkis: lol'd on that
[00:29:29] <Xatenev> :p
[00:30:19] <White_Cat> so this is the existing code http://pastebin.com/eXyNHY4g
[00:31:15] <White_Cat> this is my attempt http://pastebin.com/iEfUZDgQ
[00:31:39] <White_Cat> the code is run inside an xml
[00:32:45] <White_Cat> xml fragment for the original code: http://pastebin.com/EwDyqyjT
[00:33:37] <White_Cat> xml code for my attempt: http://pastebin.com/W0RAV5TL
[00:34:06] <White_Cat> I probably have a mistake with my syntax
[00:35:07] <Uhkis> White_Cat: make a fiddle instead of multiple random pastes
[00:35:14] <Uhkis> jsfiddle.net
[00:35:20] <White_Cat> Uhkis okay
[00:36:02] <Chulbul> #freenode
[00:36:32] <Chulbul> tumtune :D
[00:37:38] <White_Cat> Uhkis http://jsfiddle.net/ob08q66k/
[00:38:20] <White_Cat> my attempt http://jsfiddle.net/wkmrLmze/
[00:39:38] <Xatenev> oe_Webitsale_sale is not defined
[00:39:39] <Uhkis> so what's the problem?
[00:39:48] <Xatenev> @White_Cat
[00:39:57] <Uhkis> Xatenev: it is in the earlier fiddle
[00:40:09] <Xatenev> oh
[00:40:36] <Xatenev> but what is "my attempt"?
[00:40:42] <Xatenev> are u trying to rebuild the code from ur first fiddle?
[00:40:57] <Uhkis> i have no idea what his problem even is :)
[00:44:00] <White_Cat> Xatenev odoo is a complicated system
[00:44:16] <White_Cat> all I am trying to do is create a single field that saves information for line.name
[00:44:54] <White_Cat> first fiddle is the code from odoo, unedited
[00:45:14] <White_Cat> odoo primarily runs with python and xml so this jquery protion threw me off :(
[00:45:25] <Uhkis> odoo is also horrible and incomplete :D
[00:45:25] <Xatenev> yea and now?
[00:45:38] <Xatenev> Like i told u : oe_website_sale is not defined
[00:45:48] <White_Cat> I can try to locate it
[00:46:29] <Xatenev> u have to set a variable like in the first fiddle
[00:46:40] <Xatenev> probbaly, even though I have absolutely no idea what odoo is
[00:46:40] <Xatenev> xP
[00:47:31] <White_Cat> in css I have .oe_website_sale .row .row .col-md-12 { float: none; }
[00:47:57] <White_Cat> .oe_website_sale input.js_quantity { min-width: 48px; text-align: center; }
[00:48:05] <Xatenev> that doesnt help u if oe website sale is undefined
[00:48:06] <Xatenev> :o
[00:48:24] <Xatenev> your using a variable which doesnt exist
[00:49:08] <White_Cat> let me post each js file associated with this module
[00:49:12] <White_Cat> there are like 5
[00:49:42] <Xatenev> so jsfiddle 1 and 2 are associated with each other? .p
[00:49:51] <White_Cat> I believe so
[00:52:29] <Uhkis> White_Cat: from your attempt: the selector doesn't match that html, there's also no data-line-id attribute (#5) or product-id (#7)
[00:52:57] <White_Cat> yes because that is odoo specific
[00:53:20] <White_Cat> http://pastebin.com/LJRNZ1NC <- css
[00:53:29] <White_Cat> http://pastebin.com/kqt8bm47 <- js

[00:53:50] <White_Cat> http://pastebin.com/iYHn9PbG
[00:53:57] <White_Cat> Xatenev those are the js files I see
[00:56:54] <Xatenev> White_Cat: i honestly dont think anybody can help u like this :o
[00:58:43] <White_Cat> I half expected that
[00:58:47] <White_Cat> I am completely lost
[00:59:04] <White_Cat> at least is my syntax correct?
[00:59:14] <White_Cat> http://jsfiddle.net/wkmrLmze/
[01:15:08] <Uhkis> White_Cat: syntax seems fine (apart from the missing variable)
[01:26:34] <White_Cat> Uhkis that'd be oe_website_sale right?
[01:27:07] <Uhkis> yes
[01:27:46] <White_Cat> I am searching the entire module and it is only mentioned on those .js/.css files and template.xml
[01:27:55] <kokut> Hello, how do you delete an element?
[01:28:09] <Cork> ?api remove
[01:28:09] <b-ot> Cork: .remove(): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[01:28:28] <Cork> don't forget to kill all references to the element too
[01:28:32] <Cork> or you will keep them alive
[01:28:49] <titii> I have a click event on A element. In this function I can access that element by $(this), sure? But in this function i am call another function with callback, like dosomethink(function(){... how can i acces that previous $(this) element here? ... })
[01:28:57] <White_Cat> Uhkis I have a <div class="container oe_website_sale">
[01:29:01] <White_Cat> would that be it?
[01:29:16] <Uhkis> White_Cat: that would be $('.oe_website_sale')
[01:29:17] <Cork> titii: you would have to forward the variable
[01:29:36] <White_Cat> rest of the code is inside this div
[01:29:38] <White_Cat> for the xml
[01:30:09] <titii> Cork: how it looks like?
[01:30:23] <Cork> function_to_all($(this)) for example
[01:30:44] <Cork> titii: or... i might read your example wrong
[01:30:48] <Cork> could you create a fiddle?
[01:34:06] <White_Cat> Uhkis
[01:34:06] <White_Cat> http://jsfiddle.net/ob08q66k/
[01:34:09] <White_Cat> is this better?
[01:34:24] <titii> Cork: see this http://jsfiddle.net/dn9o004k/
[01:35:18] <Cork> titii: http://jsfiddle.net/dn9o004k/1/
[01:35:28] <Cork> titii: or you could just scope the variable in the event handler
[01:35:59] <Cork> titii: http://jsfiddle.net/dn9o004k/2/
[01:37:36] <White_Cat> http://jsfiddle.net/a0wx33ot/
[01:37:53] <titii> Cork: ok, ty, i am going to play with
[01:38:40] <White_Cat> sorry the last one didn t seem to save
[01:41:08] <Uhkis> White_Cat: what about that
[01:44:08] <titii> Cork: the first example works. But it works also with callback.call(el);
[01:44:59] <Cork> titii: call(el) will make this a jquery object not a dom element
[01:45:05] <Cork> but yes that works too
[01:45:22] <Cork> titii: also not you don't have to forward this element through the callback
[01:45:31] <Cork> you can just inherit it like i showed at the top
[01:45:32] <titii> Cork: so the "call" miracle is to mount that element to using here as a this?
[01:45:43] <Cork> ?mdn call
[01:45:44] <b-ot> Cork: Function.prototype.call() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[02:09:32] <Mement> I am working on validation with multiple forms in one modal. Every form his fields has an unique number assigned with it. When the user presses the save button, I want to retrieve all the values from that particular form in an array. How can I do this, without placing every field manually in the array? I want to be able to do something like, when the id number matches '6002_', place them in one array. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/5z3rg81c/
[02:11:27] <omnivibe> why would this every be blank in an ajax request?: error: function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) { console.log(JSON.stringify(jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders())); }.bind(this)
[02:11:49] <omnivibe> I am seeing it only in some weird edge case (embedding a browser in an iOS app)
[02:23:35] <jost> I have a jQuery ui resizable element, that has an element as containment. The containment roughly has the same size than the viewport, so it may change its size (for example on orientation change of a mobile device). How can I force the resizable component to adapt to the new containment area?
[02:52:56] <Xatenev> Heya
[02:52:57] <Xatenev> fast question
[02:53:06] <Xatenev> how do I write this: onmouseover="(src='../../../images/siegel/qm_big.jpg') in jquery?
[02:57:52] <Xatenev> [solved]
[03:03:27] <Uhkis> Xatenev: you should really do that with css or you're gonna have problems with that path
[03:04:29] <titii> What is performing better: $('.pagination li:eq(0)') ? or $('.pagination li').eq(0) ?
[03:04:47] <Cork> titii: historically its been the later one
[03:05:07] <Cork> but they have worked on sizzle quite a bit so it might have changed in 1.9+
[03:06:51] <titii> Cork: ^^ ty
[03:07:30] <Cork> Xatenev: and ya, as Uhkis said, there is no reason to have that in js
[03:15:57] <Chulbul> Most of the times I see people  using jQuery.noConflict() or jQuery instead of $, I think if code related to jquery is handled properly we never need to use noConflict, am I right or its just a misconception ?
[03:16:56] <Cork> Chulbul: noConflict is useful if you need to run it side by side with a different framework
[03:17:18] <Cork> like prototype
[03:17:56] <Cork> many use it to run multiple versions of jquery at the same time, and that is a much worse idea
[03:21:07] <Chulbul> Cork, ah ok
[03:47:02] <maxvi> how can I get width of the window with scroll ? now I can get $(window).width() without the scroll and with $(document).width() - the same
[03:48:45] <maxvi> or maybe I can get scroll width ?
[03:50:09] <Cork> you can create and element and calculate the size of the scrollbar
[03:50:16] <Cork> but you can't ask for the width
[03:51:22] <Cork> maxvi: this is what i use http://jsfiddle.net/jht4qb29/
[03:54:46] <deeprogram> Hi
[03:55:24] <deeprogram> I set .css("padding-bottom") every time when mouse move on mobile website , is it ok ?
[03:55:58] <deeprogram> but it is not soft
[04:19:36] <Mement> I have this variable called 'values'. When I do console.log(values), I get this output: http://pastebin.com/mZbFFznM
[04:19:43] <xec> weeee netsplit
[04:19:59] <Mement> How do I only get the 'title' value? values[title] does not work.
[04:20:11] <Cork> Mement: what is the question?
[04:20:18] <Cork> opps missed the continuation :X
[04:20:58] <Cork> Mement: what does console.log(typeof(values)) give you?
[04:21:05] <Cork> ugg
[04:21:06] <Cork> Mement: what does console.log(typeof(values)) give you?
[04:21:19] <Mement> Hehe, I've read it. Gimme a sec.
[04:21:56] <Mement> Hm, it gives object
[04:22:29] <Cork> and console.log(Object.keys(values))
[04:23:05] <Mement> Cork: ["'title'", "'style'", "'token'"]
[04:23:10] <Cork> ah
[04:23:23] <Cork> Mement: values['\'title\'']
[04:23:35] <Cork> you might want to fix what generates it
[04:23:44] <Cork> so it doesn't double quote the keys
[04:25:34] <Mement> Ah, that is strange indeed. Well, thanks for letting me know about log(Objects.keys(..))
[04:27:18] <hk3380> why can't i change the height of an element using this : `$('.class')[0].height()` ?
[04:27:48] <hk3380> is it a jquery objects vs dom elements kind of misunderstanding?
[04:28:38] <Cork> ?api eq @ hk3380
[04:28:38] <b-ot> hk3380: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[04:28:49] <Cork> height() isn't a dom method
[04:29:43] <hk3380> Cork: oh i see
[04:31:40] <hk3380> so how would i access the jquery object corresponding to a dom element in a .each() loop (e.g $('.class').each(function(i, obj) { })) )
[04:32:04] <Cork> hk3380: $(this)
[04:32:13] <hk3380> oh
[04:32:15] <hk3380> thanks
[04:32:35] <Cork> or $(obj) of you prefer that
[04:32:42] <hk3380> umm how do i know when this is in my namespace?
[04:32:48] <hk3380> is it like always implied?
[04:32:55] <Cork> each function creates a new this variable
[04:33:03] <hk3380> alright, i see
[04:50:34] <Omar-> hi Cork how are you?
[04:59:55] <Mark_2> anybody know greensock and papervision?
[05:05:19] <wheeei> inconstistancy in the spaces between function(){ drives me mad! JShint says: function () { but seeems like standard is: function() {
[05:18:35] <Omar-> is there a faster selector than :eq() .eq()?
[05:22:40] <titii> Is there some efective way to get the GET params from URL? I need to check only one, and then use his value
[05:23:18] <Cork> titii: window.location.search.split('&')
[05:31:36] <Cork> Omar-: .eq() is as fast as it can possibly get
[05:31:53] <Cork> its basically a short hand for $(orgObj[0])
[05:40:19] <Omar-> Cork I thought there could be a faster selector
[05:40:27] <Cork> it isn't a selector
[05:40:30] <Omar-> like :nth-child()
[05:40:42] <Cork> it litteraly takes what you have and wraps it
[05:41:04] <Cork> nth-child could be faster if you don't already have the elements
[05:41:11] <Cork> but it doesn't do anything like eq
[05:41:41] <Omar-> hmmm i thought it was similar to :nth-child()
[05:41:51] <Omar-> thanks Cork
[05:42:14] <Cork> Omar-: nth-child is a psudo selector that is like a true/false filer
[05:42:42] <Cork> after the other selections has happened and the element is the nth child of it's parent
[05:42:44] <Cork> you get it
[05:42:50] <Cork> else you get nothing
[05:43:00] <beasty> Cork: ! o/
[05:43:02] <Cork> eq just grabs the x index of the result list
[05:43:14] <Cork> nothing more nothing less
[05:43:17] <Cork> beasty: o/
[05:43:24] <Omar-> Cork yup, it gets the element based on its index
[05:43:37] <Cork> Omar-: ya, and nth-child doesn't
[05:43:51] <Cork> for example <div><span></span></div><div><span></span></div>
[05:44:02] <Cork> $('span:nth-child(1)').lenght == 2
[05:44:29] <Cork> *length
[05:44:38] <Cork> $('span:eq(1)').length == 1
[05:44:42] <Omar-> this should return 1
[05:44:44] <Cork> no
[05:44:50] <Cork> nth-child should return 2
[05:44:50] <Omar-> lol
[05:44:56] <Omar-> let me fiddle it sec
[05:44:57] <Cork> cause both are the first child of there parents
[05:47:33] <Omar-> Cork you're right, just got it
[05:48:07] <Cork> a much more interesting part
[05:48:22] <Cork> for <div><i></i><span></span></div><div><i></i><span></span></div>
[05:48:35] <Cork> $('span:nth-child(1)').length == 0
[05:48:46] <Cork> and that often bites ppl
[05:48:47] <Omar-> why?
[05:48:59] <Cork> cause the spans isn't the first child anymore
[05:49:09] <Omar-> oh true
[05:49:22] <Cork> so it isn't "first span of parent"
[05:49:32] <Cork> its "first child of parent if it is a span"
[05:49:46] <Omar-> so nth-child means "first child" of parent?
[05:49:57] <Omar-> not that its within X element?
[05:50:00] <Omar-> interesting
[05:50:11] <Cork> no (1) is the offset
[05:50:20] <Omar-> so nth-child will only work if the element is first child
[05:50:24] <Cork> no
[05:50:34] <Cork> you've missed the point
[05:50:39] <Omar-> hmmm i'm confused now
[05:50:44] <Cork> $('span:nth-child(2)').length == 2
[05:50:55] <Cork> as the spans is the second element of the parent
[05:50:57] <Omar-> ohhhh
[05:51:22] <Omar-> i:nth-child(1) == 2
[05:51:27] <Cork> yes
[05:51:29] <Omar-> got it now
[05:51:34] <Cork> or i:first-child
[05:51:35] <Omar-> thanks :)
[05:51:42] <Cork> or span:last-child
[05:56:24] <neuromute9> hey folks, trying to iterate over a tables rows in an iframe, but for some reason it only returns the first tr (even though there is more), the same code works fine on other pages (non-iframed)... any ideas?
[05:56:47] <neuromute9> the code: $('#table_name tr')
[05:57:02] <neuromute9> I'd expect an array, but I just get a single tr
[05:57:23] <Cork> neuromute9: are you sure your using jquery?
[05:57:36] <Cork> cause jquery always return an array (like object)
[05:58:09] <neuromute9> hmm, yeah, 1.6.2/jquery.min.js
[05:58:37] <Cork> run console.log($.fn.jquery) where you get the error
[05:58:48] <neuromute9> well, I get just an expandable tr (containing 3 tds)
[05:58:53] <Cork> it should be "1.6.1" if it really is jquery
[05:59:09] <neuromute9> TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined
[05:59:13] <Cork> exactly
[05:59:13] <neuromute9> aha
[05:59:19] <Cork> so $ isn't jquery
[05:59:27] <neuromute9> so, jQuery is not available in the iframe?
[05:59:32] <neuromute9> balls
[05:59:45] <Cork> not sure what you're doing so possibly
[06:00:26] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to add a number of conditions to prevent / enable when a colorbox dialog pops up. I am wondering if there is a cleaner way to go about it. I am effectually disabling the colorbox (it never pops) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b84cc828f1b5d3859846
[06:00:27] <neuromute9> yeah, just run the same command in the "top frame" in chrome inspector and it returns 1.6.2
[06:00:52] <Cork> neuromute9: try jQuery instead
[06:00:53] <Cork> might work
[06:00:56] <neuromute9> it's only when I change to the "myiframe" layer that things break :(
[06:01:04] <neuromute9> I don't have control of the page
[06:01:08] <Xatenev> neuromute9: I found this answer
[06:01:08] <Xatenev> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10950034/how-to-use-jquery-from-parent-inside-an-iframe
[06:01:13] <Xatenev> maybe its what u need?
[06:01:14] <neuromute9> being cheeky and trying to scrape!
[06:01:26] <neuromute9> Xatenev, thx
[06:03:31] <neuromute9> Xatenev, cheers, but the content is blocked because of cross origin
[06:03:34] <neuromute9> oh well!
[06:09:51] <neuromute9> Thanks folks, looks like it's time to use straight up javascript! ;)_
[06:16:37] <prohobo> your face is a javascript
[06:17:49] <oddvar> what, weakly typed?
[06:18:15] <prohobo> and it lacks structure
[06:18:40] <oddvar> and occasionally freezes up awkwardly
[06:18:57] <prohobo> btw
[06:19:06] <prohobo> i just reduced a 500 line script to 133 lines
[06:19:16] <prohobo> and the script STILL sucks
[06:21:35] <neuromute9> =D
[06:29:55] <baako> why is it not possible to do something like this in javascript? http://jsfiddle.net/ggp1Lpkh/
[06:30:52] <baako> I am trying to alert 1 but it just alert null.
[06:32:52] <prohobo> baako, you never actually call the function
[06:32:56] <prohobo> you just declared it
[06:33:14] <prohobo> if you want to run the function call "helloworld();"
[06:33:32] <prohobo> just like you called "alert(test);"
[06:47:31] <baako> prohobo: thanks
[06:49:36] <islalobo> Hello, is there a better way to pass a number of conditional statements like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/245e516c84fd36fd7965
[06:53:19] <sacho_> those are ridiculously long ids
[06:53:30] <islalobo> sacho_: that aside....
[06:53:37] <sacho_> you might want to select the elements first, so your conditional is more clear
[06:53:58] <islalobo> sacho_:  like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22294112/jquery-check-if-any-text-input-has-value
[07:13:21] <islalobo> sacho_: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1625632c74074f202f78
[07:22:46] <cjohnson> yeah that's mildly better
[07:23:07] <cjohnson> except I thought you were checking .val() for the first one initially?
[07:23:15] <cjohnson> if they all have the same check, you can put them in an array
[07:23:35] <cjohnson> and depending on your environment use Array#every
[07:24:07] <cjohnson> otherwise if you're hoping this to be clean code and relatively expandable I might move the conditions into data attributes on the elmenets themselves (like how jquery validate does it)
[07:25:07] <islalobo> Some are checkboxes and some are input fields (not included yet)
[07:25:31] <islalobo> cjohnson: can you share an example of what you mean
[07:26:16] <baako> prohobo: this is the use case here http://jsfiddle.net/ggp1Lpkh/1/ its still null
[07:26:32] <cjohnson> islalobo: http://jsfiddle.net/f9mLb5en/  if they all had the same check, that is
[07:27:02] <islalobo> same check?
[07:27:25] <cjohnson> woops I meant: http://jsfiddle.net/f9mLb5en/1/
[07:27:41] <cjohnson> yeah as in, if you just wnat to check if an array of IDs all have their respective checkboxes checked, you could use Array#every with a simple callback
[07:28:17] <cjohnson> if you wanted to vary the checks (some are is(':checked'), some are .val() !== '', etc) then I would consider a more advanced way of psecifying the conditions, a la jquery validate
[07:28:21] <cjohnson> see jquery validate's page for examples
[07:30:20] <cjohnson> baako: you're trying to use asynchronous code synchronously
[07:30:56] <islalobo> cjohnson: and if I wanted to add the input fields as well? to check that they had a value? http://jsfiddle.net/yctbgk9a/
[07:30:57] <cjohnson> baako: you need to delay the code that uses socketId not to fire until the callback that defines it completes. check out promises
[07:31:42] <cjohnson> islalobo: that's mildly better. like I said, if you're going the route of having different checks per-field, I would use something like jquery validate. or at least craft my own
[07:32:04] <cjohnson> islalobo: the problem with this method is there's no way to add new fields to your form without also updating this javascript snippet and knowing what goes where
[07:32:08] <cjohnson> not good for maintainability
[07:32:42] <islalobo> cjohnson: what if I needed something quick and dirty for now though? And could go back to jquery validate?
[07:33:24] <cjohnson> in my experience, the "quick and dirty for right now" approach becomes the long-term solution. partially because it becomes harder to go back and do it right once you implement your band-aid
[07:34:04] <cjohnson> what you have will work. it's just not great for maintainability. if you're going to go that route make sure you use es5-shim because Array#every isn't available in older browsers
[07:36:29] <islalobo> cjohnson++
[07:38:09] <spudzee1111> http://jsfiddle.net/L4ej5qn4/ is there anyway I can make this animation look more like a circle turning into a triangle, and not whatever the hell it currently looks like when you mouse over it?
[07:40:55] <cjohnson> no clue but personally I think that's pretty cool
[07:41:04] <cjohnson> though obviously move those styles into a css class and not inline JS
[07:41:23] <spudzee1111> well… I can’t do that with the current situation on my actual site
[07:41:40] <baako> cjohnson: so i need to delay the alert?
[07:42:06] <spudzee1111> oh wait, were you talking to me, cjohnson?
[07:42:13] <synthecypher> Is there a way to add a "trigger once event handler", until it's readded?
[07:46:43] <bbclover> hey guys, how do I make a command line ajax call to some url just to see if I'm connected properly?
[07:46:49] <bbclover> trying to narrow down some error, that's why I'm wondering
[07:47:21] <islalobo> synthecypher: I have used .one before with different things like 'mouseover'
[07:47:58] <synthecypher> islalobo: Yeah I saw that in the doc but it said "at least one trigger per event type or something"
[07:48:13] <synthecypher> Which made me think that it'd still linger for some reason
[07:48:55] <bbclover> and by command line, I mean the f12 browser console
[07:55:41] <Mark_2> how do i use this ajax code? $("#targetContainer").load("external-file.html #content");
[07:55:55] <Mark_2> what goes into first () and second ()
[07:55:55] <Mark_2> ?
[07:58:15] <Omar-> what do you mean by first () and second () Mark_2?
[07:58:25] <Mark_2> $("#targetContainer").load("external-file.html #content");
[07:59:13] <Omar-> $("old_content").load("external_file.html #element to replace old_content")
[07:59:21] <Mark_2> hmmm...
[07:59:38] <Mark_2> can you take a look at this Omar- http://greensock.com/forums/topic/11279-topdocument-when-using-gs-in-an-iframe/
[07:59:41] <cjohnson> baako: you need to move it to a callback. as I said, promises are a good way of doing that
[07:59:49] <cjohnson> baako: a simple time delay isn't the right way
[08:00:00] <Mark_2> can you think of anysolution to this problem of mine?
[08:00:10] <cjohnson> spudzee1111: I was. And of course you can -- if you can add JS, you can add CSS
[08:00:12] <cjohnson> even if it's inline
[08:00:29] <cjohnson> just move it into classes instead of being a bunch of inline styles is all
[08:00:38] <cjohnson> bbclover: curl
[08:00:46] <cjohnson> oh. you don't mean command line after all
[08:00:57] <cjohnson> you would do it like you would do any other ajax call.
[08:01:02] <Omar-> Mark_2 what about the link? it's not related to your question about .load()
[08:01:11] <cjohnson> if you have jquery, you can use $.ajax. otherwise the normal XHR methods
[08:01:12] <Mark_2> it is related.
[08:01:37] <Mark_2> but i have no idea how to use ajax, i should probaby wait until i get decent understanding of it.
[08:01:38] <islalobo> cjohnson: I'm looking at jquery validate, but I'm not certain it will help me in this situation. I'm not trying to validate my form, but to only show a popup block if the conditions are met
[08:01:51] <cjohnson> that's form validation ;)
[08:01:58] <cjohnson> even if it's just a subset of your form
[08:02:17] <cjohnson> anyway you don't have to use it -- you could just borrow the concepts. namely that it parses the conditions it has to meet from the html nodes itself
[08:02:32] <cjohnson> <input type="checkbox" data-required="true" />
[08:02:47] <cjohnson> then look up checkboxes with [data-required=true] instead of hard-coding a list of IDs
[08:02:55] <ircbaako> cjohnson: http://kopy.io/ymPZu Uncaught ReferenceError: client_channel is not defined line 51
[08:03:02] <spudzee1111> okay, I’m still learning about css transitions, but I’ll see what I can do.
[08:03:29] <cjohnson> ircbaako: of course not, it's in an entirely different function
[08:04:27] <ircbaako> this is when javascript need properties like php :S
[08:05:57] <bbclover> cjohnson: but a simple 1 line thing just to see if it worked
[08:06:28] <bbclover> $.ajax({ url: whatever, success: function() { alert("successful" } });?
[08:07:03] <cjohnson> ircbaako: that has nothing to do with it. PHP's paradigm won't help here because PHP is entirely synchronous and doesn't have scoping like JS does
[08:07:05] <bbclover> or do I need to specify type?
[08:07:18] <cjohnson> ircbaako: here is a very quick dirty rewrite to show you how to pass data asynchronously: http://jsfiddle.net/0h4qbLmx/
[08:07:30] <cjohnson> all I did was make connection accept a function that gets called after it completes its business
[08:07:50] <Omar-> Mark_2 sorry i just scrolled to the ajax post
[08:07:55] <cjohnson> bbclover: well when you tested your theory did it work or give you an error?
[08:08:05] <bbclover> error, expecting )
[08:08:19] <cjohnson> which code did you use, exactly
[08:08:42] <bbclover> oh I found it, my alert wasn't closed. but now it says error: invalid argument
[08:08:48] <cjohnson> which code did you use, exactly
[08:08:52] <cjohnson> ;P
[08:08:53] <bbclover> $.ajax({ url: "<%=request.getContextPath()%>" + "/ajax/listMatterTemplates.do", success: function() { alert("successful") } });
[08:09:06] <cjohnson> that doesn't look like a valid URL
[08:10:18] <bbclover> ok I fixed the url and got an http 500 error
[08:10:31] <cjohnson> sweet then you've figured it out
[08:10:38] <bbclover> but idk what http 500 is
[08:10:41] <cjohnson> server error
[08:10:48] <cjohnson> so check out your server
[08:11:27] <bbclover> but my server is working cause I'm on the web app right now
[08:11:40] <cjohnson> a 500 error is a server error, plain and simple
[08:11:53] <cjohnson> use your network tab to investigate the request and make sure it's sending appropriate params and what-not
[08:11:54] <bbclover> I thought it was a generic error because it doesn't know what to tell you
[08:12:02] <cjohnson> it's a generic server error ;)
[08:13:36] <Omar-> Mark_2 here's an example of .load http://jsfiddle.net/s8oy40k5/
[08:13:55] <ircbaako> cjohnson: can you do something like callback(channel, client_channel); connection(function(channel, client_channel) {
[08:14:18] <cjohnson> ircbaako: it's a function, you can make it do whatever you want. if you're going to start adding a bunch of things, I would use an object though
[08:14:19] <Omar-> Mark_2 new content are on a different file http://jsfiddle.net/kz0r47en/
[08:14:30] <cjohnson> callback({channel: channel, client_channel: client_channel})
[08:14:37] <cjohnson> then connection(function(options) {
[08:14:41] <cjohnson> options.channel;
[08:14:41] <Mark_2> i see.
[08:14:41] <cjohnson> etc
[08:15:21] <Mark_2> probably my issue isn’t related to ajax afterall then.
[08:15:55] <Omar-> Mark_2 with effects http://jsfiddle.net/s8oy40k5/1/
[08:16:15] <Omar-> Mark_2 i'm not experienced with iframes
[08:16:33] <Mark_2> k. thanks! these inspired me a bit.
[08:17:48] <ircbaako> cjohnson: so with that example can i then use it in the ajax like client_channel:channel, or will it be client_channel:options.channel,
[08:18:38] <Omar-> Mark_2 you're welcome:)
[08:22:55] <cjohnson> ircbaako: not sure what you mean. paste what you're trying to do
[08:23:00] <[Non]> hi
[08:23:07] <[Non]> is there anyone who could help me with the live site pls?
[08:23:53] <surfdue> notchris: hola
[08:24:05] <notchris> hey @surfdue
[08:24:09] <cjohnson> [Non]: just ask your question.
[08:24:10] <notchris> Whats up man
[08:24:27] <surfdue> notchris: nm so you working for that place or just doing freelance work?
[08:24:44] <notchris> surfdue: I work for them full time
[08:24:47] <notchris> But I freelance on the side
[08:25:06] <surfdue> notchris: nice, IT department or full web?
[08:26:19] <ircbaako> cjohnson: http://kopy.io/SEXFq
[08:27:47] <cjohnson> ah, yep that looks okay. is client_channel something $.ajax is expecting though?
[08:29:29] <notchris> surfdue: I’m the Webmaster
[08:29:40] <notchris> ‘webmaster’ lol
[08:29:48] <notchris> But I’m the only one editing the website as of now
[08:29:53] <notchris> I do some IT too
[08:30:03] <[Non]> http://kutsalpenguen.com/realestate/# here you can see slider right?
[08:30:04] <ircbaako> cjohnson: so you can see on the link var channel is some strings
[08:30:12] <[Non]> i settimeout this slider slide automatically
[08:30:40] <[Non]> but i want this slider never stop sliding
[08:30:44] <[Non]> how can i accomplish that
[08:31:17] <[Non]> codes are in main.js 17 - 26 line
[08:31:37] <[Non]> really basic horizontal accordion but i cant adjust automatically slide all slides all the time
[08:31:39] <Joe____> Hello i need help with jquery validation ... so i have a registration form with two "pages"... if the one page is validates it slides the page to the side and the next page is ready to be validated... i could do 2 forms .. but i have to process the data thruw one form :S herrrlp? :x
[08:31:59] <surfdue> notchris: nice. so have you talked to your leadership about potential solutions, come up with any ideas?
[08:33:29] <Omar-> Joe____ are you using jquery mobile?
[08:33:42] <cjohnson> Joe____: you could add the rules for part 2 dynamically if your rules are generated in JS
[08:33:49] <Joe____> Omar- No
[08:34:14] <cjohnson> Joe____: or use 2 forms, when form 1 completes and validates, append its contents into a hidden div in the second form
[08:34:55] <[Non]> i cant?
[08:34:55] <Joe____> cjohnson yea the second solution seems better thanks :)
[08:34:56] <[Non]> okay thanks :D
[08:35:18] <Joe____> thanks a lot to u
[08:37:43] <islalobo> Trying to get this to work : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6a6195b9970d3e5a5ea5
[08:38:03] <[Non]> okay i change my question:
[08:38:09] <islalobo> I only want the popup to show when the text field '#edit…." has a value
[08:38:49] <Omar-> .val() != ""
[08:38:54] <Omar-> islalobo ^^
[08:40:08] <islalobo> Omar-: tried that, but when I fill in the field, the popup isn't popping
[08:40:44] <islalobo> Omar-: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7f3089ffa6b07a6470f4
[08:40:50] <islalobo> That is the full attempt
[08:44:17] <Omar-> islalobo this should work, but why are you using .one()? it will bind mouseover once only
[08:45:03] <islalobo> Omar-: we only want it to show once. I guess if I'm placing all these other conditions I don't need one any more...
[08:51:26] <cjohnson> what happened to the solution you had before?
[08:51:27] <[Non]> cjohnson: could you help me out just for 1 sec?
[08:51:27] <Omar-> islalobo .val() > 0 if value is number and .val() != "" any value. both should work
[08:51:27] <cjohnson> if you paste your code and ask your question about it [Non]
[08:51:27] <Omar-> [Non] which slider are you taking about?
[08:51:27] <robertmaxrees> .val() can't be a number.
[08:51:27] <robertmaxrees> it's always a string.
[08:51:27] <islalobo> cjohnson: I think it was something with the .one('mouseover') and checking for the text value — it wasn't working so I was trying to debug that and buildup to what you had suggested (not jquery validate I am not feeling ready for that)
[08:51:27] <Omar-> cities photos?
[08:51:27] <[Non]> http://kutsalpenguen.com/realestate/#
[08:51:27] <[Non]> yes Omar- cities phtoso
[08:51:29] <[Non]> im trying some timer logic but it working wrong way
[08:51:57] <[Non]> it doesnt show first and last images but logic is working correcy
[08:51:58] <[Non]> correct
[08:52:03] <[Non]> could you check it now please?
[08:52:14] <cjohnson> that's not a code paste. and you aren't asking a code question
[08:52:27] <robertmaxrees> [Non] like i said yesterday, you need to make a fiddle.
[08:52:32] <cjohnson> heh
[08:52:38] <[Non]> okay
[08:52:47] <[Non]> just a sec.
[08:52:53] <Omar-> thanks
[08:53:11] <robertmaxrees> boom
[08:53:17] <Omar-> beach
[08:53:21] <Omar-> :P
[08:53:22] <oddvar> party
[08:53:31] <robertmaxrees> how's everybody doing today?
[08:53:53] * Omar- is doing good but bored
[08:53:59] <Omar-> and you robertmaxrees
[08:54:07] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I've had better — we're on the heels of a release that I'm behind in.
[08:54:26] <robertmaxrees> not too bad here.  working on normal friday stuff.
[08:54:44] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: glad to hear!
[08:55:20] <robertmaxrees> going to a combo bday bar crawl for a close friend and my band's singer, so that'll be fun.
[08:55:47] <cjohnson> awwwww yeah bar crawl
[08:55:50] <cjohnson> drink that whiskeys
[08:58:39] <[Non]> now it doesnt work in fiddle
[08:58:39] <[Non]> goooooodddd
[08:58:39] <robertmaxrees> Show us what you've got so far, then.
[08:58:39] <[Non]> http://jsfiddle.net/dwarf/dykqjcbz/
[08:58:39] <[Non]> here
[08:58:39] <[Non]> :(
[08:58:39] <[Non]> i just want this:
[08:58:40] <[Non]> in order, slides just keep going
[08:58:40] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery included.
[08:58:40] <[Non]> jesus
[08:58:40] <[Non]> i didnt sleep last night i am like stupid's meaning in dictionary
[09:00:09] <robertmaxrees> so you gonna include it or what?
[09:00:14] <islalobo> can I make a list like this if I have a bunch of textfields: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/03bdc2603d14ac5dd205
[09:00:23] <[Non]> okay i fix that now
[09:00:26] <[Non]> http://jsfiddle.net/dwarf/dykqjcbz/
[09:00:26] <[Non]> here
[09:00:29] <[Non]> :)
[09:00:35] <islalobo> like: (a,b,c,d….)
[09:00:40] <robertmaxrees> hit "update" and share the new link, [Non]
[09:01:02] <robertmaxrees> islalobo not sure what you're looking for.
[09:01:09] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/t5hczggv/
[09:01:17] <[Non]> http://jsfiddle.net/dwarf/dykqjcbz/1/
[09:01:20] <[Non]> here
[09:01:21] <_DB> hey guys im trying to change the value of my data-id on a div
[09:01:23] <robertmaxrees> islalobo are you trying to use .trim() on a bunch of different values?
[09:01:27] <_DB> when a click a anchor
[09:01:34] <_DB> when i**
[09:01:40] <robertmaxrees> _DB don't use onclick
[09:01:40] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: not possible?
[09:01:53] <robertmaxrees> islalobo nope.  need to do them all separately.
[09:01:53] <_DB> what should I use?
[09:01:58] <islalobo> Okay
[09:01:59] <robertmaxrees> an event handler in js.
[09:02:22] <_DB> an event handler that runs when?
[09:02:25] <robertmaxrees> click.
[09:02:29] <[Non]> so if we are on this code if you click slide randomly, somethings broken some image just for one sec setting width 1090% or something.
[09:02:47] <robertmaxrees> _DB http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5hczggv/1/
[09:03:47] <robertmaxrees> [Non] you're missing variables here.
[09:04:02] <[Non]> where
[09:05:19] <robertmaxrees> open your console and interact with it, yo.
[09:05:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll see.
[09:06:28] <_DB> hey robertmaxrees I switched it to the event handler like you said
[09:06:37] <_DB> but its still not switch the data id
[09:06:38] <robertmaxrees> and now your code works fine :D
[09:06:40] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[09:06:45] <robertmaxrees> don't use the inspector to check
[09:07:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5hczggv/3/
[09:07:46] <robertmaxrees> the data attribute won't update - the cached value you care about does.
[09:07:59] <_DB> ohh
[09:08:00] <_DB> ok
[09:08:01] <_DB> haha
[09:08:09] <cjohnson> it's a little confusing don't feel bad
[09:08:52] <[Non]> robertmaxrees - i dont care this error right now actually, but i noted this. my number 1 question is: infinite slide
[09:09:02] <[Non]> how can i integrate this code infinite slide...
[09:09:18] <robertmaxrees> [Non] code with bugs and errors rarely works as intended.
[09:09:46] <[Non]> robertmaxrees: i know, im rookie..
[09:10:11] <robertmaxrees> if you want to have an infinite sliding animation, create a recursive function that selects the next one, waits, and then calls itself to start the whole thing over.
[09:10:37] <[Non]> if you had time just one more last(you see my questions all the time already) fix my code and show me where the bug is or error
[09:10:49] <[Non]> i am using jslint btw, it doesnt giving me error on that code
[09:11:26] <robertmaxrees> it throws errors for me fwiw.
[09:12:01] <[Non]> god damn it
[09:12:10] <[Non]> thanks
[09:12:10] <[Non]> :)
[09:13:05] <robertmaxrees> let me show you the recursive function concept.
[09:13:12] <robertmaxrees> since that can be a little confusing.
[09:14:24] <De0Sama1> I'm tryign to get $.get('url', {data:"data"}).done(function(data){console.log(data)}); to work, but it's not logging?
[09:14:26] <[Non]> i'll appreciate
[09:15:14] <robertmaxrees> De0Sama1 is it throwing an error?
[09:15:31] <De0Sama1> robertmaxrees, it's doing literally nothing...
[09:15:39] <robertmaxrees> check the .fail() callback.
[09:15:51] <De0Sama1> after the .done?
[09:15:56] <sacho_> De0Sama1, assign a .fail handler as well, use a debugger and place breakpoints on the $.get, the success and the error callbacks.
[09:15:58] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:16:06] <robertmaxrees> also check your network tab
[09:16:59] <De0Sama1> hmm
[09:17:03] <De0Sama1> yeah, nothing in the network tab
[09:17:07] <_DB> how can I send over the child elements from one div to another
[09:17:09] <_DB> append?
[09:17:51] <sacho_> sure
[09:18:06] <sacho_> inserting a node in another part of the dom removes it from the dom first
[09:18:16] <De0Sama1> robertmaxrees, ohhh, i see. It's "pending"
[09:18:17] <sacho_> so it'd work like a move.
[09:18:24] <De0Sama1> hmm, it looks liek there might be something wrong with that file.
[09:18:31] <De0Sama1> I'll have to check that out. Thanks a lot! :D
[09:20:43] <robertmaxrees> [Non] http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dykqjcbz/5/ should basically be what you want.
[09:21:25] <robertmaxrees> this is fragile and makes some assumptions, but you get the idea.
[09:22:58] <[Non]> robertmaxrees - thanks.
[09:22:59] <[Non]> okay
[09:23:39] <[Non]> so friends, im newbie at jquery, and i want to do quality code. if you know "you must know this about jquery" articles or etc, i'll be glad
[09:23:47] <[Non]> and happy to read'em all!
[09:23:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn some JS basics first.
[09:24:10] <Velveeta> like 2 + 2 = 5, for sufficiently large values of 2...
[09:24:34] <[Non]> okey im just typing js basics then.. :)
[09:24:55] <robertmaxrees> http://eloquentjavascript.net/ is liked.  javascript: the good parts and javascript: the definitive guide are also really good.
[09:25:08] <_DB> [Non} you wnat to make something slide across the screen?
[09:25:08] <robertmaxrees> MDN has some tutorials, and the jquery learning center is a fantastic resource, too.
[09:25:16] <_DB> [Non] **
[09:25:39] <[Non]> _DB - i covered up thanks to robertmaxrees
[09:25:54] <_DB> ah alright I have a script i made two weeks ago for that
[09:26:14] <[Non]> srsly
[09:26:16] <[Non]> haha
[09:26:28] <robertmaxrees> i will mentioned.... http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[09:26:30] <Captain_Haddock> I'm seeing "TypeError: x.easing[this.easing] is not a function"; jquery and jquery UI 1.10. Any idea why this might be happening?
[09:26:42] <_DB> basically just have a div(container) with a absolute(position) div in it on event click change its left attribut
[09:26:53] <Velveeta> i love having the opportunity to throw out shouldiuseacarousel.com :D
[09:27:02] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Haddock you're probably passing in an invalid selector somewhere.
[09:27:09] <_DB> or which ever attribute (its easy to understand once you make a simple one)
[09:27:17] <robertmaxrees> or you're passing an easing value that's not valid.
[09:27:40] <Captain_Haddock> ok, lemme see
[09:28:08] <_DB> hey so If I want to take all the child elements from one div
[09:28:16] <_DB> and send it to another what function would I use?
[09:28:32] <_DB> I believe I used append for this on a page
[09:28:44] <[Non]> elequent is free?
[09:28:50] <[Non]> i love that robertmaxrees guy!
[09:28:51] <[Non]> :D
[09:29:07] <robertmaxrees> _DB http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9867283/moving-the-content-of-a-div-to-another-div-with-jquery
[09:29:11] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend :D
[09:29:43] <[Non]> okay im starting to read this from the beginning
[09:29:55] <[Non]> i hope this will be helpful to my bad, useless code
[09:30:04] <robertmaxrees> it's not useless mano.
[09:30:11] <robertmaxrees> you just need to hone your skills.
[09:30:32] <Velveeta> i love this site for easings: http://easings.net/
[09:30:35] <[Non]> and thats what i'll do.
[09:31:25] <_DB> lol thanks robertmaxrees I appreciate it, lol yeah I was using appendchild
[09:31:26] <Velveeta> [non]: they have a part 2 also ;)
[09:31:39] <_DB> appendTo works a bit better though easier to remember
[09:32:05] <[Non]> Velveeta - could you send me a link?
[09:32:25] <[Non]> sorry im asking everything from you i wll search
[09:33:28] <robertmaxrees> _DB you can use append or appendTo
[09:33:37] <robertmaxrees> functionally identical, just a different order of things.
[09:33:44] <_DB> ahh alright
[09:34:03] <_DB> I like appendTo its a bit more cleaere hey get the contents of this and append them to that
[09:34:17] <Velveeta> [non]: no problem, but the 2nd version isn't free: http://www.nostarch.com/ejs2
[09:34:29] <Velveeta> i haven't read it myself, but was a fan of the first one
[09:35:46] <[Non]> btw
[09:35:56] <[Non]> robertmaxrees do you use meteor?
[09:36:06] <[Non]> pff dollar is high up there dude! :D
[09:36:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:48:07] <syzygy_> is it worth checking if a element exists in the DOM before adding an event handler w/ jQuery?
[09:51:12] <robertmaxrees> .on() checks for you.
[09:52:38] <jeffmjack> could somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong here?  http://jsfiddle.net/sn0m76fs/2/
[09:53:06] <robertmaxrees> the car and $li vars aren't scoped to those iterators.
[09:53:21] <robertmaxrees> *cat
[09:53:23] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support?
[09:53:47] <jeffmjack> oy
[09:54:01] <robertmaxrees> variables are scoped to functions.
[09:54:02] <jeffmjack> it's basically a homework assignment; I'm using Chrome
[09:54:06] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[09:54:13] <robertmaxrees> do you have to use for?
[09:54:23] <jeffmjack> what browser would not be supported here?
[09:54:30] <robertmaxrees> IE8
[09:54:36] <robertmaxrees> for what i'm about to do at least.
[09:54:43] <jeffmjack> I'd like to, otherwise how would I create an arbitrary number of elements?
[09:54:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:54:57] <robertmaxrees> you can use forEach() instead.
[09:54:59] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[09:55:03] <jeffmjack> ok great
[09:55:16] <jeffmjack> yeah I'm thinking about scope and looking at it and still not understanding where i'm going wrong
[09:55:27] <robertmaxrees> so basically, for loops don't have scope.
[09:55:41] <Captain_Haddock> I'm seeing "TypeError: x.easing[this.easing] is not a function"; jquery and jquery UI 1.10. Any idea why this might be happening? <--- My selector appears to be fine.  $("#foo .bar a").toggle() works fine; $("#foo .bar a").toggle( "bounce", { times: 3 }, "slow") gives me this error.
[09:55:56] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Haddock can you fiddle it to show us?
[09:55:57] <jeffmjack> so you mean the vars don't get re-instantiated with each iteration?
[09:56:08] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack so you can use closure to give you what you want :)
[09:56:23] <Captain_Haddock> (I must note that I'm doing this in Drupal)
[09:56:24] <robertmaxrees> oh err so there's a simpler problem here hahaha
[09:56:37] <Captain_Haddock> robertmaxrees: Lemme see if I can recreate this.
[09:56:39] <Captain_Haddock> Thanks
[09:56:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sn0m76fs/3/ on a simple level jeffmjack
[09:56:57] <robertmaxrees> you were missing a closing )
[09:57:21] <jeffmjack> me? re: closing )
[09:57:25] <robertmaxrees> yes
[09:58:30] <jeffmjack> weird I got no errors; usually jslint catches stuff like that
[09:59:32] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: so that first code block (non-closure) doesn't work, right?
[09:59:45] <robertmaxrees> well, it does, but it's not optimal.
[10:00:23] <jeffmjack> because with that closing ) fixed I would expect to see both blocks work, and it appears that there's only one working
[10:00:25] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sn0m76fs/4/ take a look here
[10:00:36] <robertmaxrees> we'll adress the error you're getting in a second :)
[10:00:55] <robertmaxrees> so my last fiddle shows you what the engine is actually doing under the hood when it runs this code.
[10:01:43] <jeffmjack> oh got it
[10:01:50] <jeffmjack> variable hoisting is not blocked by for loops
[10:02:01] <jeffmjack> is that correct?
[10:02:07] <robertmaxrees> right, because the only things that get scope are functions.
[10:02:14] <jeffmjack> I see
[10:02:21] <robertmaxrees> for loops aren't functions, therefore...
[10:02:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:02:26] <jeffmjack> I see
[10:02:49] <jeffmjack> what do you call a variable at the base level scope of a js script?  Not global, right?
[10:03:14] <jeffmjack> global is an even more basic property of the Window object, right?
[10:03:20] <robertmaxrees> your "names" variable is global.
[10:03:25] <robertmaxrees> because it's not scoped to a function.
[10:03:37] <jeffmjack> ok so you do call that scope global
[10:03:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:03:45] <robertmaxrees> anything declared within that document ready is scoped to that function, so it's not global.
[10:04:44] <jeffmjack> ok got it :) and the reason why the first code block doesn't do anything?
[10:04:49] <robertmaxrees> it does actually.
[10:04:54] <robertmaxrees> the second block is what's broken.
[10:04:57] <jeffmjack> ah
[10:05:19] <robertmaxrees> you're basically doing $li.html()() <-- that second set of parens is what's killing you.
[10:05:49] <jeffmjack> ah
[10:06:18] <jeffmjack> $li.html(()()) is what needs to happen?
[10:06:22] <robertmaxrees> if .html() returned a function, that might make sense, but it doens't so your code barfs because the engine things you're trying to invoke a function.
[10:06:32] <robertmaxrees> what's the point of the ($li) there?
[10:07:35] <jeffmjack> right.  it occurs to me that if I needed to be using closures (which I don't here) I would need to make that first $li come from an IFFE function as well?
[10:07:56] <jeffmjack> where, in line 22?
[10:07:57] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use an iife in this case.
[10:08:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sn0m76fs/5/
[10:08:18] <jeffmjack> ok.  yeah that's what I was trying to do to pass cat.name to html()
[10:08:19] <robertmaxrees> use forEach() instead.
[10:08:52] <jeffmjack> and that's for IE compatibility?
[10:09:01] <robertmaxrees> IE8 doesn't support it.
[10:09:06] <robertmaxrees> but 9 and above do.
[10:09:23] * Velveeta puts on a Mugatu wig and says "That robertmaxrees.. he's so hot right now"
[10:09:25] <jeffmjack> then why is forEach better?
[10:09:35] <robertmaxrees> see how forEach() uses a callback for each item?  that gives you a separate scope for each item you're processing.
[10:10:26] <robertmaxrees> this makes it so you can create variables and do stuff without fear of conflicting with other variables outside of that function.
[10:10:42] <robertmaxrees> so the cat and $li in the first enumerator are distinct from the ones in the second.
[10:11:46] <jeffmjack> I see
[10:12:01] <robertmaxrees> looking at this again, it looks like you don't actually need the second one?
[10:12:34] <jeffmjack> that's correct, although I'm curious; it would work if the iffe was correctly written?
[10:13:08] <robertmaxrees> you could use an IIFE here, sure, but then I'd ask you why you you need the iterator in the first place.
[10:14:42] * robertmaxrees gets on soapbox
[10:15:15] <robertmaxrees> for loops are kind of weird.  they're friendly and neat - they can be useful sometimes!  but they're not really the "right" solution in a lot of cases.
[10:16:20] <robertmaxrees> in 95% of cases, they're used to do something for each property in an object (arrays included) and they work.  but see that little "var" declaration you end up having to use in them?  why are you creating a variable if you don't need it?
[10:16:37] <Captain_Haddock> robertmaxrees: Is the bounce syntax here kosher? "$("#foo .bar a").toggle( "bounce", { times: 3 }, "slow");" It works fine in fiddle without the {times:3} and "slow" options.
[10:16:44] <Omar-> [non] has gone?
[10:16:44] <Captain_Haddock> I just copy/pasted that from the docs.
[10:17:02] <Captain_Haddock> (From here: http://api.jqueryui.com/bounce-effect/ )
[10:17:05] <Omar-> i fixed his animation http://jsfiddle.net/rn52kox1/ :(
[10:17:08] <robertmaxrees> the classic iterator is weird - for (var i = 0; i < someLength; i++) {} - why am I counting if what i really want to do is act on every element in an array?
[10:17:10] <robertmaxrees> stuff is weird.
[10:17:13] * robertmaxrees gets off soapbox.
[10:17:29] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Haddock i'd have to see a fiddle of it broken.
[10:17:50] <robertmaxrees> i doubt the docs are wrong, but there's a chance.
[10:18:26] <Captain_Haddock> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/0pfdzjhx/
[10:18:33] <Velveeta> "why am I counting if what i really want to do is act on every element in an array" -- that's probably the best case i've heard for using .forEach vs a for loop
[10:18:53] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Haddock you don't have jquery ui included.
[10:19:04] <Velveeta> although, internally, .forEach is probably just implemented as a for loop, making it just sugar on top :D
[10:19:05] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Haddock http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0pfdzjhx/1/
[10:19:14] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta sure - and thus is abstraction.
[10:19:19] <Velveeta> true
[10:19:27] <robertmaxrees> let the abstraction figure that part out for you, and let that scope handle the counting.
[10:19:33] <Velveeta> excellent point
[10:19:43] <robertmaxrees> these are the things i think about when driving home at the end of the day.
[10:20:22] <robertmaxrees> i used to not get the whole "iterators are bad" and "side effects!!1!!1!!one!!" thing, and then it clicked one day.
[10:20:58] <Captain_Haddock> robertmaxrees: Thanks. So jquery_ui only works with jquery 1.9.1?
[10:21:07] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Haddock no...?
[10:21:15] <Captain_Haddock> Or is that a jsfiddle peculiarity?
[10:21:27] <robertmaxrees> that's jsfiddle being weird - doesn't show it unless you drop down to 1.9.1
[10:21:32] <robertmaxrees> or some earlier versions.
[10:21:40] <robertmaxrees> you can use it with 1.11 though
[10:21:47] <Captain_Haddock> I see
[10:35:08] <amore123> how can I detect the "go back" button ?
[10:36:14] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[10:36:27] <robertmaxrees> specifically https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[10:37:15] <robertmaxrees> be aware that's not available in IE9 and below.
[10:37:52] <amore123> robertmaxrees, I read that, and I wrote this code: https://gist.github.com/Ziiweb/b40e96803f441be4a4e3
[10:38:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:38:44] <amore123> I expect the alert "are you on back?" after pressing Go back, but when I get it after pressing the link "Get more products"
[10:39:35] <amore123> but I get it *
[10:40:00] <robertmaxrees> probably because the browser is preempting anything that interrupts going to another page.
[10:40:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure though.
[11:16:10] <Captain_Haddock> Ugh. Drupal really sucks.
[11:19:55] <robertmaxrees> That seems to be the consensus
[11:20:07] <Uhkis> i disagree
[12:00:12] <kongthap> hi, i'm filling up a table from json data, i have <a> tag inside the table, but why i cannot get click event http://pastie.org/9892930
[12:02:51] <gho> hi - I'm trying to render an email on a html page but some characters are corrupted.  I've set utf8 .. any other ideas
[12:17:44] <lxsameer> hey guys, I want to force a span to be in the center of a div box ( x= y) , div size set by jquery, how can i do it ?
[12:17:59] <Zzaichik> text align: center;
[12:18:33] <Zzaichik> margin: auto;
[12:19:47] <lxsameer> vertically
[12:26:24] <bbclover> $("#myslect").empty(); properly removes all options from within a <select> tag right?
[12:27:19] <robertLunch> it can.
[12:27:43] <robertLunch> lxsameer http://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/
[12:28:19] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: what did you eat for lunch?
[12:28:44] <robertmaxrees> we have a local butcher that does smoked tri tip sandwiches on fridays
[12:29:02] <robertmaxrees> i've been good about my blood pressure lately so i had one.
[12:29:12] <bbclover> that sounds great
[12:29:20] <bbclover> I have food poisoning so I haven't eaten any solid food since yester day
[12:29:22] <bbclover> :(
[12:29:26] <robertmaxrees> ugh the worst.
[12:29:28] <bbclover> I'm so hungry
[12:30:07] <NoiseEee> s/eaten any solid food/disposed of any solid poop/
[12:30:30] <bbclover> ha
[12:30:39] <Zzaichik> lxsameer: I personally like this method. http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/
[12:31:32] <lxsameer> thanks
[12:31:52] <Zzaichik> Works very well. Won't work in <=IE8
[12:33:19] <christo_m> how can i .off a debounced function?
[12:33:33] <robertmaxrees> how did you bind it?
[12:33:42] <christo_m> something like $document.on('touchmove', _.debounce(mousemove,16)); to $document.off('touchmove', _.debounce(mousemove,16)); should that work?
[12:33:47] <christo_m> im using lodash
[12:33:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:33:51] <robertmaxrees> that works.
[12:33:59] <robertmaxrees> though i'd question unbinding in the first place.
[12:34:22] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: resetting calculations
[12:34:29] <christo_m> doing a mouse move relative to a touch start
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd reset within the handler, instead of unbidning/rebinding handlers themselves, but some people think i'm weird for it so w/e
[12:35:12] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: i cant get debounce to work properly for some reason
[12:35:22] <christo_m> im doing a tcp send inside the mousemove handler.. and im trying to throttle that
[12:36:15] <robertmaxrees> is the handler firing correctly, or is the ajax causing problems?
[12:36:28] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: it looks like it fires in succession after i stop moving.
[12:36:53] <christo_m> which is the whole problem im trying to fix.. for some reason android works fine, but on iOS the handler bunches them up and sends them (i originally thought tcp was doing the whole Nagle algorithm)
[12:36:54] <robertmaxrees> like it's "queueing up" the handler?
[12:36:58] <christo_m> ya
[12:37:12] <christo_m> sec im trying to get a better picture of whats  going on comparying it to android
[12:37:28] <robertmaxrees> nah i think i know what your problem is.
[12:38:40] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that debounce only introduces a delay - it sounds like you want to wait to make sure something has happened, instea,d yeah?
[12:38:40] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: :(
[12:38:54] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: well, can i show you how i was doing it previously?
[12:39:03] <christo_m> this code performs well in android but on iOS i can see it come in a flurry
[12:39:22] <OnceMe> Hello, why does method append() has to have all html tags in one line?
[12:39:36] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: so on touchstart event, i do something like this: http://pastebin.com/UCWuPyZS
[12:39:53] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe as opposed to...?
[12:39:54] <christo_m> mouse framerate is just var MOUSE_FRAMERATE = 1000 / 60;
[12:40:05] <OnceMe> ?
[12:40:10] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: on mouseup i clear the interval and nullify it
[12:40:14] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe what would you do instead?
[12:40:34] <OnceMe> what
[12:40:36] <OnceMe> I get error  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:40:43] <Velveeta> that's not append, that's javascript
[12:40:57] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe you can't do multiline strings in js without special handling.
[12:40:59] <Velveeta> if you want to break a string across multiple lines, you need to escape those line breaks
[12:41:03] <OnceMe> when I do something like this http://pastebin.com/UgPu96Ww
[12:41:10] <OnceMe> ok how to handle it then?
[12:41:12] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: anyway not sure if that makes sense
[12:41:31] <robertmaxrees> christo_m https://gist.github.com/robertmaxrees/a4870203415a72740681
[12:41:42] <robertmaxrees> not exactly what you;'re looking for, but it might be helpful?
[12:42:14] <christo_m> dat 10 space tab :P
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> i use actual tabs in my editor ;)
[12:42:53] <Zzaichik> OnceMe: Care to elaborate on what you mean?
[12:43:09] <OnceMe> Yes when I do this http://pastebin.com/UgPu96Ww I get error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL

[12:43:29] <OnceMe> but when I do this http://pastebin.com/eCutwk0z all good
[12:43:43] <robertmaxrees> right, because you can't randomly linebreak strings.
[12:43:59] <OnceMe> thank you

[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> opt for this if you can.
[12:45:22] <Zzaichik> ^^ Concatenate
[12:45:30] <OnceMe> so to use + or \ ?
[12:45:33] <robertmaxrees> +
[12:45:36] <OnceMe> why
[12:45:38] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: i know im in the wrong channel since this is angular stuff but : http://pastie.org/9893034

[12:45:54] <Velveeta> lol
[12:45:57] <christo_m> robertmaxrees: im noticing that http://pastie.org/9893034#15,76 gets called 1+ time
[12:45:59] <robertmaxrees> on purpose.

[12:46:07] <Velveeta> stackoverflow
[12:46:10] <robertmaxrees> the article you were linked.
[12:46:12] <OnceMe> ol
[12:46:14] <robertmaxrees> read it.
[12:46:21] <Velveeta> damnit robert, how dare you type faster than me
[12:46:22] <christo_m> i dont think mouseup is getting unbound
[12:46:33] <robertmaxrees> the answers tell you the caveat of \
[12:46:36] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: I had to leave before I could respond to your explanation of forEach vs. for loops- but it makes sense.  Thank you for the explanation :)
[12:46:37] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta i used to do data entry
[12:46:57] <Velveeta> i never did, but i took a year and a half of keyboarding in high school, many moons ago
[12:47:03] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack hahahaha fsho.  i get religious about it.  and sometimes don't know when to shut up.
[12:47:15] <Velveeta> we have a running competition here at work for the fastest typists... i think my best timing with them was something like 114 with 0 errors
[12:47:35] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta i got used to doing employment ad transcription.  you learn how to be boss with that SUPER quick.
[12:47:36] <jeffmjack> no it's great.  I love learning stuff that helps me write more professional code :)
[12:47:48] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:48:07] <OnceMe> thank you I love you all
[12:48:12] <OnceMe> Spread the love, not hate.
[12:48:22] <Velveeta> if you watch a touch typist, you can typically get an idea of what they do for a living by the kinds of words their fingers try to autocomplete wrongly as they type
[12:48:23] <kongthap> hi, please help, i'm filling up a table from json data, i have <a> tag inside the table, but why i cannot get click event http://pastie.org/9892930
[12:48:31] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta yep.
[12:48:34] <Velveeta> like i can hardly ever type the word "serve" without "server" hitting the screen before i can catch it
[12:48:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:48:47] <Zzaichik> haha I do that same thing
[12:48:55] <Zzaichik> any word ending with "erve"
[12:48:57] <robertmaxrees> kongthap because the a tags don't exist when you bind the event handler.
[12:49:00] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:49:12] <robertmaxrees> kongthap read http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for more info.
[12:49:20] <kongthap> robertmaxrees, thanks
[12:49:23] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[12:50:14] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack if you ever want to freak people out do stuff like Object.keys(myObject).forEach(function(prop) { console.log(myObject[prop]; }); and then bask in your glory.
[12:50:35] <Velveeta> friday at 3pm at work is like the worst thing ever... it's too late to care about starting anything new for the day, and too early to just go ahead and duck out
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta i actually LOVE that part of the day - gives me a chance to hit up things I want to work on.
[12:51:07] <robertmaxrees> small stuff that i don't have time for otherwise.
[12:51:11] <Velveeta> all i want to work on is drinking
[12:51:18] <robertmaxrees> i get that at 4 when we open the keg.
[12:51:21] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:51:40] <Velveeta> i have a keg waiting for me at home.. it be callin me man, it be callin me
[12:52:18] <robertmaxrees> my wife won't let me get a kegerator.
[12:52:19] <robertmaxrees> yet.
[12:52:30] <Velveeta> we only grabbed one because home depot had them on sale for like $300
[12:52:52] <Velveeta> getting the temp and co2 pressure regulated to the right levels to not have a glass full of foam has been a fun project
[12:53:04] <Velveeta> <adjust> wait a day or 2 and try again <adjust> wait another day or 2 and try again
[12:53:09] <robertmaxrees> i actually figured that part out pretty quick.
[12:53:24] <robertmaxrees> cold, settled keg and long enough lines work well for me.
[12:53:28] <Velveeta> i think mine's been running too cold
[12:53:43] <Velveeta> and i'm still running the lines it came with, which i think are 5ft, i've read 8ft is better for that
[12:54:12] <Velveeta> it's running 36-38 degrees now, at about 11 or so PSI.. i'm getting much less foam now, but it's still an issue
[12:54:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:54:52] <Velveeta> i also have no idea how to change out the line on a kegerator like this, where it runs up inside the tower (which has no cooling) for dispensing, and is crimped into a metal cap on the keg end
[12:55:11] <Velveeta> so i think that final foot warming in the tower is another part of the foam issue i need to tackle
[12:55:47] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[12:56:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to buy a new amp and then i need to get my main guitar worked on shortly after, so the kegerator delay is one of those "pick your battles" things.
[12:56:31] <Velveeta> oh i solved that problem by specializing in being a drunk instead of taking up any form of instrument
[12:56:43] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[13:00:24] <christo_m> Velveeta: are you an author?
[13:00:41] <Velveeta> i have a tech blog i haven't posted anything to in about a year
[13:01:05] <Velveeta> and a novel in outline form for several years, but that's it
[13:01:21] <christo_m> truth
[13:43:38] <MikeD_> since $.each() works on arrays and objects, is there a similar feature for .find() on native objects?
[13:44:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:44:57] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[13:46:45] <MikeD_> or an early-exiting reduce?
[13:46:57] <robertmaxrees> you can't reduce an object
[13:47:22] <robertmaxrees> you could write a recursive function to do what you want
[13:53:51] <MikeD_> i guess in this case it is $.each() with a return false when the item I'm looking for is found.
[13:54:09] <robertmaxrees> $.each() and .find() operate differently.
[13:54:32] <robertmaxrees> $.each() just enumerates, .find() searches for children, if that makes sense.
[13:58:27] <MikeD_> right, though i don't want to emulate DOM/jquery... just using a function to interrogate the objects in the array
[13:58:48] <MikeD_> ex: http://jsfiddle.net/u02uhxyc/
[13:59:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm just pointing out that .find() would do a "deep search" for elements and their children.
[13:59:30] <robertmaxrees> !mdn array some
[13:59:30] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Array.prototype.some() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[13:59:36] <robertmaxrees> this is what you really want.
[14:01:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u02uhxyc/1/
[14:02:08] <MikeD_> well i really want a reference to the one that was found
[14:02:24] <robertmaxrees> the element with that object?
[14:02:51] <MikeD_> yes
[14:04:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd use http://api.jquery.com/jquery.grep/ in that case
[14:09:40] <MikeD_> thanks

[14:15:55] <ezio> i have a function.  voila la function:     $.fn.updatefield.clearErrors = function() {
[14:16:25] <ezio> the problem is "this" is set to an instance of updatefield and not the element i'm calling the function on
[14:17:10] <ezio> any help?
[14:20:49] <robertmaxrees> how are you calling it?
[14:22:04] <ezio>     $('#title').updatefield.clearErrors();
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> because you're calling a method on updatefield
[14:23:57] <ezio> robertmaxrees, how do i not?
[14:24:09] <ezio> oh
[14:24:14] <robertmaxrees> normally you don't call methods against intermediary objects like that.
[14:25:02] <ezio> what is it trying to say here on http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/ under the heading Provide Public Access to Secondary Functions as Applicable
[14:33:14] <cod3munk> I'm trying to create an ical string in jquery and force browser to download it as an ics file. Can I do this purly in javascript/jQuery?
[14:34:25] <robertmaxrees> not afaik.
[14:45:00] <scrandaddy> Hello. Is there anything that would be causing jQuery not to append to a div in ie 8?
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> bad code?
[14:46:58] <egp> Anyone have some good jquery ui controls for allowing both a slider/range on a value, as well as picking an exact # with some variation on it, potentially having some type of bar chart to show density on the slider range too
[15:02:49] <Zzaichik> scrandaddy: a million things probably. What might help is, seeing your .append code/function. jsfiddle.com yo
[15:04:03] <scrandaddy> Zzaichik: http://jsfiddle.net/7so4nub8/
[15:04:28] <scrandaddy> doesn't get run until readyState == 'complete', works great in chrome
[15:10:46] <xibalba> got a newb Q here, trying to stop my carousel when a button is clicked. if i call the 'pause' manually it works fine, and only works from my first button not my 2nd...nTh buttons. I have 4 buttons w/the same ID, is that the issue?
[15:13:12] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:13:19] <robertmaxrees> xibalba you can only have an id once per page.
[15:13:22] <robertmaxrees> make it a clas sinstead.
[15:14:41] <xibalba> hmm, so i added 'myCarousel-info-0' to my <button>, then switched my select to $('.myCarousel-info-0').click(function () {
[15:14:50] <robertmaxrees> and?
[15:14:52] <xibalba> ^ added under class=""
[15:15:02] <xibalba> oh i missed a spot, uno momento
[15:15:59] <xibalba> sweet
[15:16:02] <xibalba> thank you sir
[15:16:26] <xibalba> now to see why my resume doesn't work
[15:19:43] <Zzaichik> scrandaddy: so it looks like this or close to? http://jsfiddle.net/7so4nub8/1/
[15:25:53] <io_____> in a panel custom layut can i check for the region content to be present before rendering the region?
[15:26:06] <io_____> sorry wrong chat
[15:27:27] <scrandaddy> Zzaichik: Yeah, but it waits until readyState is complete before executing
[15:34:48] <scrandaddy> Zzaichik: is there anything unusual about that?
[15:38:51] <Zzaichik> scrandaddy: no I don't think so. It should be fine.
[15:39:41] <Zzaichik> scrandaddy: you could post the entire code and make it work like I tried to do for you. So that we can see the entire thing. That's really the only way anyone on here will have a chance to be helpful.
[15:39:55] <Zzaichik> not your entire script but the code in question.
[15:40:56] <Zzaichik> assuming the code is sound, it makes me wonder if something is preventing readyState from equaling complete.
[15:41:35] <robertmaxrees> readyState?
[15:42:22] <scrandaddy> Zzaichik: the code is executing for sure, it's just not appending
[15:44:09] <Zzaichik> scrandaddy: maybe try simplifying that append code. First I'd try sticking something simple directly in place of where you're calling appendDiv();, you know? See if that works and works backwards from there.
[16:30:00] <nonconvergent> Hi.
[16:31:37] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[16:32:23] <nonconvergent> I'd got a text field that holds a date and a linked datepicker to it.  I like, once the date is entered, to check whether or not it is less than or equal to another date on the page.
[16:32:38] <robertmaxrees> there should be a callback for that.
[16:33:23] <nonconvergent> I tried $('#dateField').blur(function(){})
[16:33:36] <robertmaxrees> in the datePicker setup i mean.
[16:33:40] <nonconvergent> but that fires every time I pick any number in the datepicker.
[16:33:59] <acidjazz> ok heres a fun channelge
[16:34:00] <acidjazz> challenge*
[16:34:29] <acidjazz> i need to find the elemnt with the property "name" and detect its offset to the middle of my viewport
[16:34:32] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: What do you mean by callback? I'm not very good with JS.
[16:36:01] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ there should be something in here for the event you want.
[16:36:21] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz "offset to the middle of my viewport"?  kinda simple.
[16:36:55] <robertmaxrees> just get the height/width of the viewport, divide each by to, and compare against $('[name]').offset()
[16:37:00] <robertmaxrees> or is it position()...
[16:37:36] <acidjazz> i think maybe a combination of both
[16:37:45] <acidjazz> i basically have a little dot menu thing and i need to update it based on scrolling
[16:37:45] <robertmaxrees> nah, one is the offset from the window.
[16:38:03] <acidjazz> can I really scrape by $('[name]') ?
[16:38:12] <acidjazz> id like to cache these elements at least
[16:38:19] <robertmaxrees> which you should.
[16:38:24] <robertmaxrees> but you still have to do the initial select.
[16:38:29] <robertmaxrees> or give them all a class and use that instead.
[16:38:53] <acidjazz> ok so maybe like $('[name]').each in my constructor
[16:39:02] <acidjazz> and store each by name -> offset
[16:39:06] <acidjazz> lets see
[16:39:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:39:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ay0za6g1/ is how it'd "start"
[16:39:39] <robertmaxrees> though you should really give them all a class.
[16:39:43] <acidjazz> $('[name]').each(function(i, el) { console.log($(el).prop('name')); });
[16:39:47] <acidjazz> class is faster?
[16:39:48] <acidjazz> ok
[16:39:50] <acidjazz> ill give classes
[16:39:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.  class and ID are always faster.
[16:40:07] <robertmaxrees> that's also part of what they're designed to be used for.
[16:42:00] <acidjazz> ok i gave em all .section and .section_name
[16:44:51] <acidjazz> hah odd.. using .prop for name="" gives me only 1 result, using .attr i get all 4
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> you still need the .each()
[16:45:21] <acidjazz> yea im using it
[16:45:24] <acidjazz> ok so
[16:45:30] <acidjazz> $('.section').each(function(i, el) { console.log($(el).offset()); });
[16:45:38] <acidjazz> im getting top: num
[16:45:48] <acidjazz> so i need to store like name -> top
[16:45:50] <acidjazz> object
[16:46:01] <acidjazz> then my check needs to check $(window).offset9) ?
[16:46:28] <robertmaxrees> fiddle plz :)
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> because this is pretty simple.
[16:46:50] <Mark_2> does anybody know how i can replace <iframe src=“ “> with ajax?
[16:47:04] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 you load the iframe and append it whever you want it.
[16:47:32] <Mark_2> yes. but i don’t want to use iframe cause it doesn’t support communication with parent window.
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> right. so don't use the iframe.
[16:47:51] <Mark_2> let’s say i put <iframe src=“”> to load an iframe, how do i put it in ajax?
[16:47:57] <acidjazz> ok done
[16:47:58] <acidjazz>  Object {tech: 893, cap: 1690, grid: 2460, why: 3334.46875}
[16:48:13] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 with ajax.
[16:48:13] <acidjazz> now i have this cached object robertmaxrees of each sectoin and its offset().top
[16:48:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably use .load() actually.
[16:49:03] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz now get the viewport width and height, divide each by two, and now you have the center of the viewport.
[16:49:21] <acidjazz> is that $(window)
[16:49:31] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[16:49:32] <acidjazz> yea
[16:49:39] <acidjazz> so i shoudl store taht too right
[16:49:40] <acidjazz> cache it
[16:49:44] <acidjazz> until .resize
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> yep
[16:49:50] <robertmaxrees> even then.
[16:49:54] <robertmaxrees> because the reference is the same.
[16:50:12] <acidjazz> i only need height
[16:50:13] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 http://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments - this is specifically what you'll wnat.
[16:50:18] <acidjazz> i know these divs all are 100% across
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:50:43] <acidjazz> ok got it 403
[16:51:08] <acidjazz> now i what.. add that value to the viewport .. offset?
[16:51:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:51:23] <acidjazz> i need the window offset
[16:51:24] <robertmaxrees> you wanted to see where things were in relation to the middle of the screen.
[16:51:26] <acidjazz> this changes when i scroll
[16:51:33] <acidjazz> middle of the screen yes.. as i scroll
[16:51:42] <acidjazz> it fires and alters as i scroll up/down
[16:51:55] <robertmaxrees> $(window) should be just the viewport.
[16:51:57] <robertmaxrees> not the entire document.
[16:52:31] <acidjazz> i want to execute if the div is in the viewport and has passed the middle
[16:52:52] <acidjazz> basically im updating a menu based ons croll
[16:52:54] <acidjazz> hmm
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> right, so check if the div's top offset has pass the middle of the window's height.
[16:54:06] <acidjazz> ah i need scrollTop()
[16:54:14] <acidjazz> ok
[16:54:34] <acidjazz> so then i cnat really cache the divs offset
[16:54:35] <acidjazz> cuz they cahnge
[16:54:41] <acidjazz> i can cache the elements themselves
[16:54:43] <acidjazz> but not the offset()
[16:54:45] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:56:54] <acidjazz> hmm offset isnt changing
[16:57:10] <acidjazz> offset doesnt alter based on scroll
[16:57:13] <acidjazz> its hte offset to the document top
[17:01:43] <Mark_2> hmm, robertmaxress do you know why this wouldn’t work? http://jsfiddle.net/zs6a05y5/
[17:01:57] <Mark_2> i replaced iframe with aajx load
[17:02:06] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[17:02:09] <robertmaxrees> see if you get any errors.
[17:02:24] <robertmaxrees> also your $(this) isn't what you think it is insite of that ajax call.
[17:02:51] <robertmaxrees> also is your site on the same domain as the src?
[17:02:55] <Robdgreat> "I do not think it means what you think it means"
[17:03:08] <Mark_2> i am lost at the moment.
[17:03:21] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is referencing the ajax function, not what you want.
[17:03:27] <Mark_2> yeah, it’s the same domain.
[17:03:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zs6a05y5/1/
[17:03:44] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[17:04:12] <Mark_2> yeah. but it doesn’t seem to work either?
[17:04:19] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle?
[17:04:38] <Mark_2> yes
[17:04:42] <robertmaxrees> CORS
[17:04:47] <robertmaxrees> open your console
[17:05:47] <Mark_2> says string is not a function
[17:05:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zs6a05y5/1/ on here?
[17:06:02] <Mark_2> yes.
[17:06:10] <robertmaxrees> click the button.
[17:06:13] <robertmaxrees> what do you see then?
[17:06:31] <Mark_2> nothing appears.
[17:06:42] <robertmaxrees> you should see an error about CORS.
[17:06:46] <Mark_2> sec
[17:06:49] <Mark_2> var $ajaxList = $(this);
[17:06:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:06:54] <Mark_2> highlighted.
[17:07:04] <Mark_2> jquery(this);?
[17:07:05] <robertmaxrees> that is not causing errors for me.
[17:07:12] <Mark_2> well, it’s only because of my CMS
[17:07:13] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:07:18] <robertmaxrees> you said in the fiddle it was erroring...
[17:07:18] <Mark_2> it uses $
[17:07:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zs6a05y5/2/
[17:07:37] <Mark_2> nope, in the fiddle, simple it doesn’t load anything
[17:07:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:07:48] <robertmaxrees> open your console in the fiddle - it tells you why.
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> btw there are simple things you can do to re-enable $ without turning off noconflict.
[17:08:45] <Mark_2>  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://fiddle.jshell.net' is therefore not allowed access.
[17:08:53] <robertmaxrees> correct.  cors.
[17:09:01] <Mark_2> some sort of security problem?
[17:09:09] <robertmaxrees> that server doesn't allow cross-domain ajax.
[17:09:13] <robertmaxrees> not an uncommon thing.
[17:09:19] <Mark_2> what do i do then??!!
[17:09:22] <Mark_2> what do i do!!?
[17:09:24] <Mark_2> jk
[17:13:22] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: im still kinda retarded on middle of window <-> middle of div
[17:13:40] <acidjazz> height is 500px
[17:13:43] <acidjazz> the div enters the viewport
[17:13:53] <acidjazz> dont i need height of div?
[17:14:09] <acidjazz> mabye i need to know if middle of DIV is in the viewport?
[17:15:31] <Mark_2> hmm
[17:15:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:15:35] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz think duder.
[17:15:44] <Mark_2> umm i don’t know if anyone’s expertise stretches beyond this
[17:15:49] <Mark_2> but i have a question
[17:15:51] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:16:02] <Mark_2> it finally loads in ajax,
[17:16:10] <Mark_2> but it’s taking way too much to load contetns, and
[17:16:19] <Mark_2> once it is loaded,
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> did you read the link i gave you?
[17:16:29] <Mark_2> i cannot click on the ‘click button’ button.
[17:16:31] <robertmaxrees> about loading a fragment?
[17:16:39] <Mark_2> um.. nope
[17:16:41] <Mark_2> why?
[17:16:43] <robertmaxrees> red it.
[17:16:45] <robertmaxrees> *read it
[17:16:46] <Mark_2> sec
[17:17:30] <Mark_2> i read it but there’s nothing about not being able to click a button?
[17:17:46] <robertmaxrees> you need to not load an entyire othere page is my first point.
[17:18:10] <robertmaxrees> if you have event handlers you need to run, you need to bind them after you've added them or add delegated listeners for them.
[17:20:43] <Mark_2> only if i could know how.
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .on()
[17:21:16] <robertmaxrees> they explain it.
[17:21:23] <robertmaxrees> it's called "Delegation"
[17:26:07] <acidjazz> rad i got it
[17:26:17] <robertmaxrees> well done.
[17:26:20] <acidjazz> thanks
[17:29:01] <acidjazz> so what i ended up caching robertmaxrees
[17:29:10] <acidjazz> is the middle of each div, and the window middle
[17:29:26] <acidjazz> so $(el).offset9.top + ( $(el).height() / 2 )
[17:29:37] <acidjazz> topmid: $(el).offset().top + ( $(el).height() / 2 )
[17:29:48] <acidjazz> that gives me the middle of each div w/ the offset
[17:30:08] <acidjazz> then i compare that with $(window).scrollTop() + (cached middle of window)
[17:30:20] <acidjazz> Math.abs() topmid - ^
[17:30:34] <acidjazz> if that is less than the middle of the window
[17:30:43] <acidjazz> its in the middle
[17:41:35] <jonano> how to do a script like, I like, like on facebook onclick event
[17:41:43] <jonano> change from I like to unlike
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> need a backend to store like and unlike data, first.
[17:42:14] <jonano> I did already
[17:42:16] <robertmaxrees> that then exposes a url for "like" and a url for "unlike"
[17:42:25] <robertmaxrees> then you'd have an event handler.
[17:42:41] <robertmaxrees> on click, see what the current status is of the button - usually a class or data attribute.
[17:43:42] <Mark_2> hmmm
[17:43:57] <Mark_2> what do i do if i don’t load the whole thing with .load?
[17:44:07] <Mark_2> just one layer?
[17:44:10] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 use a delegated event listener.
[17:44:15] <Mark_2> to do what
[17:44:15] <Mark_2> ?
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> you have code that should run when you click a button but doesn't, right?
[17:44:47] <Mark_2> um, yeah
[17:44:59] <Mark_2> um no,
[17:44:59] <robertmaxrees> right, it doesn't run because the event binding isn't bound to the element.
[17:45:14] <robertmaxrees> add the script to the page and refactor it to use event delegation.
[17:45:35] <Mark_2> i found the reason why it won’t let me click: it’s because the invisible layer is covering the section
[17:45:44] <Mark_2> not because i haven’t delegated anything
[17:45:48] <robertmaxrees> okay, the check out the mouseevents property in css.
[17:45:53] <robertmaxrees> i think that's it at leas.t
[17:45:54] <Mark_2> i did.
[17:46:07] <Mark_2> but i found no problem. sigh
[17:46:08] <robertmaxrees> point-events, rather.
[17:46:21] <robertmaxrees> set pointer-events: none; on the thing covering the other thing.
[17:46:26] <Mark_2> the stackoverflow won’t let me ask another question within 30 minutes.
[17:46:35] <robertmaxrees> then ask here?
[17:46:40] <Mark_2> lol
[17:46:45] <robertmaxrees> i'm being serious.
[17:46:57] <Mark_2> okay. you are a very kind and generous person.
[17:47:04] <robertmaxrees> that's what the channel is for.
[17:47:14] <Mark_2> but my understanding is very limited when itcomes to jquery and ajax.
[17:47:30] <Mark_2> did you mention css3 pointer property?
[17:47:37] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[17:47:46] <robertmaxrees> this isn't an ajax problem now.
[17:48:55] <Mark_2> i don’t think it has anything to do with pointer evens.
[17:48:58] <Mark_2> *events
[17:49:06] <Mark_2> something is still blocking me from clicking hyperlinks.
[17:49:13] <robertmaxrees> " it’s because the invisible layer is covering the section"
[17:49:28] <Mark_2>  but i can click hyperlinks except for that section only.
[17:49:45] <Mark_2> so, i presume that the content layer is covering the section
[17:50:06] <robertmaxrees> are they normal hyperlinks or are you trying to run some kind of event handler?
[17:50:22] <robertmaxrees> does the cursor do its normal icon when hovering over the anchors or what?
[17:50:31] <robertmaxrees> really hard for me to help troubleshoot blindly.
[17:50:43] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96 i click on the click me button and an ajax load shows up
[17:50:53] <Mark_2> and then if i click on the close button
[17:51:00] <Mark_2> i cannot click on the click me button anymore.
[17:51:10] <robertmaxrees> i can.
[17:51:14] <Mark_2> weird.
[17:51:17] <robertmaxrees> but you have something weird going on with that load.
[17:52:10] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:52:31] <Mark_2> any porn materials?
[17:52:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:52:38] <kevin-brown> I think I've identified a bug that's only present in the 1.x line of jQuery with `$.fn.data()` (no arguments): https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/2969#issuecomment-73341908
[17:52:38] <kevin-brown> I'm having difficulty tracking down why it's happening only in 1.x though
[17:52:39] <Mark_2> jk
[17:53:25] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 that's a lot of network overhead.
[17:53:40] <Mark_2> my cms is pretty heavy.
[17:53:48] <Mark_2> just as heavy as wordpress
[17:53:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to expose only the data you need iunstead.
[17:54:41] <Mark_2> i will try to frame the whole thing with a layer and load the layer only then.
[17:55:50] <robertmaxrees> kevin-brown sounds like a browser compat thing to me.
[17:56:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd file a bug maybve.
[17:56:23] <robertmaxrees> *maybe
[17:56:39] <kevin-brown> robertmaxrees: the problem though is that I'm working in the latest browsers, and jQuery isn't conforming to the spec in 1.x :\
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> right - 1.x retains support for older browsers, including those that might not support data attributes.
[17:57:14] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if that's part of the issue.
[17:57:18] <robertmaxrees> bad code paths.
[17:57:23] <robertmaxrees> so you file a bug with jquery.
[17:57:44] <kevin-brown> right, planning on it
[18:00:07] <robertmaxrees> jonano you figure it out?
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i leave.
[20:24:38] <emocakes> AFTERNOON GUYS
[21:04:05] <baako> if 1 == 1 or if 1 === 1?
[21:07:21] <Primero> numeric equal or boolean equal
[21:07:37] <Primero> what do you want?
[21:08:14] <Primero> 1 == 2 its false  1 === 2 is true, or maybe Im wrong
[21:08:35] <Primero> baako
[21:09:09] <baako> yes Primero
[21:09:50] <Primero> numeric equal or boolean equal,what do you want?
[21:10:09] <baako> $x == $y Returns true if $x is equal to $y
[21:10:15] <baako> $x === $y Returns true if $x is equal to $y, and they are of the same type
[21:10:44] <Primero> any thing diferent to zero its true, its boolean
[21:10:50] <Primero> === ist boolean
[21:10:57] <baako> dont make sense so if x was CAT and y was cat then === will be false?
[21:11:14] <baako> because x is uppercase
[21:14:06] <Primero> yes,its correct
[21:14:37] <Primero> CAT have diferent ascci code than cat
[21:14:55] <Primero> CAT have diferent ASCII code than cat
[21:15:45] <Primero> string compare, internal use ASCII code, if you want ignore case, you need use function for lowecase or uppercase both
[21:16:38] <Primero> sorry by my poor english, you can understand me?
[21:18:25] <Primero> my mistake, === its same value and same type, not boolean
[21:18:36] <Primero> but, CAT and cat, its not the same value
[21:21:34] <Primero> use           "x.toUpperCase() === y.toUpperCase();"
[21:25:44] <snkcld> how do i tell the browser to not do anything to the dom while im making changes?
[21:25:55] <snkcld> i mean, tell the browser to not like, update the page
[21:26:07] <snkcld> as im updating the dom etc. but then when im done, tell it  to do what it needs?
[22:21:47] <sacho_> that's what browsers usually do.
[22:51:04] <Agamemnus> Why doesn't this run the .done function?
