[00:18:30] <MACscr|lappy> nvm about the resize handles. issues was my addition of padding to the box. Now to figure out the rotate handle
[00:26:10] <MACscr|lappy> got that resolved too
[00:26:13] <MACscr|lappy> woo hoo
[01:38:04] <MACscr|lappy> hmm, now to figure out how to get a non selected even to remove all the ui features it has after you select a new element https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/WmKrrZ?editors=1111
[01:38:34] <MACscr|lappy> removing the class current_pub is easy, but there are a bunch of others that were dynamically added
[01:40:42] <Audlex> i was wondering if someone could help me in exchange for high fives? i am not too sure how to make newArray.push dynamic with the a,b,..,h,i keys
[01:40:44] <Audlex> https://pastebin.com/uCfF1Lvd
[01:41:05] <Audlex> where checkedArray = length of how many i must push
[02:00:40] <Cork> MACscr: try .resizable('destroy') i think all ui modules has it
[02:01:02] <Cork> Audlex: keys?
[02:01:05] <Cork> arrays don't have keys
[02:01:42] <Cork> so do you want an array ([1,2,3,4]) or an object ({a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4})
[02:07:28] <Audlex> object sorry
[02:08:54] <Cork> well object don't have .push, or length
[02:09:19] <Cork> object is var variable = {}; varaible.key = value;
[02:09:39] <Cork> you can do Object.keys(variable).length to make an array of the keys and then count them
[04:48:43] <Jasein> are you still allowed to create your own selectors like ":something" and can you style elements in css using the same selector?
[04:49:00] <Cork> yes, and no
[04:49:14] <Jasein> great and not-so-great.
[04:49:23] <Cork> those selectors are siszle extensions, the browser known nothing about them
[04:49:55] <Jasein> right, but I thought you could use them to filter elements
[04:51:06] <Cork> Jasein: ya... but what do you mean by in css then?
[04:51:22] <Cork> cause you can use it in jquery selectors, but not in css
[04:52:01] <Jasein> Currently on scrolling, I run a filter that checks the position of several elements. I thought it might be nice to have that filter run under an expression like ":current"
[04:52:16] <Jasein> then it would be cool to stylize :current element in css.
[04:52:24] <Jasein> I figure that's probably too much to ask,
[04:52:35] <Cork> Jasein: i would actually recommend against it, cause this is a method that will have to run on each element to filter them out
[04:52:45] <Cork> but it will not be visible in the code that "this is slow"
[04:52:48] <Jasein> which I am doing now
[04:52:52] <Cork> as it looks like css selection
[04:54:28] <Jasein> lemme write a fiddle, thanks for your help.
[05:01:17] <Cork> Jasein: this is how you do it https://jsfiddle.net/v2ne9qw0/
[05:01:53] <Cork> but remember the warning, i DON'T recommend doing this, cause you might be hiding from the maintainer that they are about to add something slow in a fast path of the page
[05:02:16] <Cork> it is usually better to wither provide a filter(function_name) or similar
[05:02:30] <Cork> it does the same thing, but indicates better that it isn't native performance
[05:02:56] <Cork> wither==either
[05:05:29] <Jasein> I was hoping to do something like this. But I see what you are saying: https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7yrgLfxd/9/
[05:07:19] <Jasein> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7yrgLfxd/11/
[05:07:44] <Cork> ya, [":"] it depricated
[05:09:57] <Jasein> almost works: https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7yrgLfxd/15/
[05:10:42] <Cork> again [":"] is depricated, use the new format
[05:11:06] <Jasein> what do you mean by the new format? Lemme look at how you did it again.
[05:13:48] <Jasein> strange, but $.expr.pseudos.current=function (el) {} doesn't seem to work.
[05:14:26] <Cork> what version of jquery are you using?
[05:14:34] <Jasein> jquery edge
[05:15:03] <Jasein> doh. For some reason jsfiddle stops working for a minute
[05:15:40] <Jasein> I just saved it and it worked. But It should still work until I save the changes I have made. so weird. It's like auto update partial
[05:15:48] <Jasein> it works fine, thanks.
[05:16:07] <Cork> ya, jsfiddle has been unstable for a while now sadly
[06:09:26] <undefined_bob> I prefer codepen anyway
[06:16:25] <thykka> Jasein, maybe this could help... https://github.com/xtianmiller/emergence.js
[14:06:19] <MACscr> Cork thanks!
[16:24:16] <soda__hobart> hi everybody, I'm kind of confused about why I can't add a property to this object:  here's a paste https://pastebin.com/xnk7QRLC  Does it have something to do with the scope of the AJAX success function?
[16:24:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:24:57] <robertmaxrees> getJSON is async
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> so anytthing that relies on its return needs to be in the callback
[16:26:29] <soda__hobart> so the callback can't be used to modify a variable that's declared outside of the callback?
[16:26:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> so it DOES modify that same object, but anything that comes after that ajax call may or may not happen after the ajax call finishes.
[16:27:18] <robertmaxrees> because it's async.
[16:27:30] <soda__hobart> sorry, I have bronchitis and I'm on all kinds of cold medicine
[16:27:32] <robertmaxrees> so the browser fires the request and then keeps going - it doesn't wait for your call to finish.
[16:27:39] <soda__hobart> yeah that makes sense
[16:28:05] <robertmaxrees> s'why you gotta sort of invert your logic when you get into doing things with async.
[16:30:59] <soda__hobart> yeah, usually I keep the variables that I'm trying to modify outside the function scope and refer to them with arguments or something like that, but I see how this is different.
[16:31:24] <robertmaxrees> so it has nothing to do with scope.
[16:31:27] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.,
[16:37:13] <MACscr> any ideas how to get my double click event work on .current_pub? https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/WmKrrZ
[16:37:35] <soda__hobart> right on, it works now!
[16:37:38] <MACscr> i think there is a conflict with the other events there
[16:38:00] <robertmaxrees> MACscr soooo...
[16:38:04] <robertmaxrees> what should happen when i double click?
[16:40:35] <robertmaxrees> oh that's easy.
[16:40:48] <MACscr> robertmaxrees the attribute contenteditable is set to true
[16:41:08] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jJvBdx
[16:41:24] <robertmaxrees> it's because nothing has that class on pageload.
[16:41:35] <MACscr> oops. duh
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:43:51] <MACscr> robertmaxrees hmm, is it working in your link?
[16:43:57] <robertmaxrees> MACscr no
[16:44:01] <robertmaxrees> i just added a console log
[16:44:09] <robertmaxrees> i avoid fixing things for y'all by default ;)
[16:45:08] <MACscr> ha, i got it working. thanks
[18:19:52] <luist> whats the correct way to enable a form button if the user starts typing in the field? i tried this but the keyup part is not working: https://paste.ofcode.org/ftyHkDruYnFJa44wKrwhcJ
[18:20:59] <luist> oh nvm, just a typo
[18:21:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:07:02] <kawhi> is it possible to clear all the fields of a form using a single click
[19:07:07] <kawhi> like a "clear form" button
[19:08:11] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/reset
[19:08:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:08:20] <robertmaxrees> don't even need js for it.
[20:26:16] <rjCousineau> Hello. I want to bind 'click' globally, but on certain exception, use the click binding of a specific element
[20:29:41] <rjCousineau> i'm looking for something like  if(el.hasEvent('click')
[20:41:20] <robertmaxrees> why?
[20:42:25] <robertmaxrees> seems like a weird code smell.
