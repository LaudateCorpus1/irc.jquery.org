[04:34:15] <mikunos> hi guys I am trying to include in my webpage the CKEDITOR but the PATH is not correct and the error is TypeError: $(...).ckeditor is not a function
[04:34:28] <mikunos> I have set the var CKEDITOR_BASEPATH = '/js/ckeditor/';
[04:34:39] <mikunos> before the CKEditor code
[04:34:50] <mikunos> but it doesn't get this path
[04:34:59] <mikunos> how have I to do?
[04:47:50] <mikunos> any idea?
[04:48:39] <mikunos> this is the page
[04:48:39] <mikunos> http://itango.dance/cms/test.html
[04:49:09] <mikunos> TypeError: $(...).ckeditor is not a function http://itango.dance/js/application.js
[04:49:23] <mikunos> but it is already set
[04:49:51] <mikunos> any help?
[04:49:54] <mikunos> or hint?
[04:53:25] <aven1> why do you think it's jquery plugin?
[04:53:51] <mikunos> aven1 are you talking with me?
[04:53:57] <aven1> yes
[04:54:21] <mikunos> so I have not understood your question
[04:54:43] <mikunos> the CKeditor is loaded after the JQuery
[04:55:38] <mikunos> and I don't understand why I get that error
[04:55:44] <Woet> mikunos: what did you base your decision on to use $(..).ckeditor
[04:56:17] <mikunos> because I need a Wysiwyg editor
[04:56:37] <Woet> .
[04:56:42] <Woet> i'll rephrase it
[04:56:54] <Woet> mikunos: what made you believe that $(..).ckeditor is the way to initialise the editor
[04:57:09] <mikunos> $( '.wysiwyg' ).ckeditor( function( textarea ) {â€¦});
[04:57:37] <Woet> that's not an answer to my question.
[04:58:21] <mikunos> as described in the manual I can see $( 'textarea.editor' ).ckeditor();
[04:58:27] <Woet> please link that manual.
[04:58:33] <mikunos> http://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-for-jQuery
[04:58:47] <Woet> i don't see you loading the jquery adapter as described in that manual.
[04:58:57] <aven1> maybe you need to load the adapter as well
[04:58:58] <aven1> ?
[04:59:24] <mikunos> wait I need to double check it
[05:00:32] <mikunos> solved aven1 I have forgot the adapter
[05:00:49] <aven1> great
[05:00:50] <Woet> i recommend reading the actual manual next time
[05:00:58] <mikunos> thanks and Merry Christmas!
[05:01:00] <mikunos> ok
[05:01:21] <aven1> yea, that's always helpfulll
[06:06:33] <tyu_> how to get clone of  namecheap.com theme
[06:32:29] <stangeland> I am in element $(this). How do i search ancestors until i find the first element of type fieldset?
[06:52:50] <AlexR> .closest
[06:53:53] <AlexR> `api closest @stangeland
[06:53:53] <b-ot> stangeland: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:58:15] <wa5ted> any ideas how i can get css values from pseudo elements like :hover
[06:59:31] <wa5ted> .split(" ")
[06:59:34] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/gxfd2p3u/
[06:59:37] <wa5ted> ^example fiddle
[07:00:14] <wa5ted> stangeland: look into nth-of-type
[07:02:50] <AlexR> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/gxfd2p3u/1/
[07:03:53] <wa5ted> AlexR: i need to do it without the event
[07:04:07] <AlexR> as in look up a css style?
[07:04:21] <wa5ted> yes
[07:05:13] <AlexR> hmm, don't think it's possible
[07:05:43] <AlexR> you can add an additional style selector, create a hidden element with that additional class and then get the style that way
[07:05:59] <AlexR> ie: .test:hover, .test.hover-class {background:blue;}
[07:06:31] <AlexR> and then create an element that is <div class="test hover-class" style="display: none;"></div>
[07:06:56] <wa5ted> AlexR: there has got to be a way
[07:07:01] <wa5ted> is it not just reading css values
[07:07:03] <wa5ted> wait nvm
[07:07:06] <wa5ted> its reading dom
[07:09:10] <AlexR> you can try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/754607/can-jquery-get-all-css-styles-associated-with-an-element
[07:10:02] <wa5ted> AlexR: i could also store the text-shadow value in :after?
[07:10:31] <AlexR> don't know if it'd do anything unless you have a content:"" in the after as well
[07:11:24] <wa5ted> AlexR:  tried with as well didnt work
[07:11:50] <AlexR> what are you trying to do?
[07:12:07] <wa5ted> well i need to read text-shadow value
[07:12:11] <wa5ted> that is in a  :hover
[07:13:13] <AlexR> and why can't you use the .hover or .on("mouseover"?
[07:13:34] <wa5ted> because im reading the value
[07:13:39] <wa5ted> inside a setInterval
[07:14:12] <wa5ted> AlexR: http://paste.ofcode.org/bQqZmdcAZ4tuMwthvusS95
[07:15:08] <wa5ted> AlexR:  i got it
[07:15:23] <wa5ted> AlexR: after thing worked except i have to use this to get it: var color = window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('.button.frost'), ':after').getPropertyValue('text-shadow');
[07:21:47] <AlexR> yeah that works
[07:22:01] <AlexR> surprised jquery doesn't do that behind the scenes
[07:22:16] <AlexR> i haven't personally used that before, so you may want to read into it a little more
[07:29:30] <wa5ted> AlexR: yeah, im having trouble setting the :hover text-shadow values
[07:46:19] <abailarri> Hello. I want to know if send password via ajax is a good idea or is insecure
[07:46:32] <Duvdevan> abailarri: good
[07:46:39] <Duvdevan> but secure it

[07:47:07] <abailarri> ok Duvdevan I hav ssl on mu website
[09:03:00] <SirLagz> I'm trying to do a window.location = "http://blah" inside a getJSON's success function - but when the success function loads, it doesn't actually change the page, but I can see that it loads the page in firebug. Why would that be ?
[09:34:17] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/c4vjyk1o/
[09:34:21] <wa5ted> ^how do i get this to work
[09:34:26] <wa5ted> i fee like its something stupid
[09:34:40] <wa5ted> the function should be traversing up the dom until it finds and image
[09:34:45] <wa5ted> or background property
[09:37:18] <shoky> wa5ted: you're running $(this).parent()  where this===window.  and.. wtf is ::before
[09:37:36] <wa5ted> ::before is for ie8?
[09:37:47] <wa5ted> how do i get it to target that particular element
[09:38:00] <wa5ted> in other words change the scope of $(this)
[09:38:02] <wa5ted> shoky: ^
[09:39:23] <shoky> var elem = $(...); elem.css('background', whatever( elem.parent() ) )    /
[09:39:23] <shoky> ?
[09:40:16] <shoky> or... $(...).css('background', function(){ ... $(this).parent() })
[09:40:50] <wa5ted> shoky: okay, cause i have many buttons like that, so the $(this).parent() part is relative to each one
[09:40:54] <wa5ted> kinda like instances
[09:41:21] <shoky> btw i doubt you want   != 'undefined'   there
[09:41:35] <wa5ted> wel what would you suggest
[09:41:37] <shoky> also you're skipping the direct parent
[09:42:03] <shoky> you're comparing it to the string 'undefined'
[09:42:17] <wa5ted> get rid of the quotes?
[09:42:41] <wa5ted> shoky: to do instances id need to do a .each
[09:42:50] <wa5ted> right?
[09:42:59] <shoky> wat
[09:42:59] <shoky> ?
[09:43:37] <wa5ted> shoky: see i hae multiple .frost buttons
[09:43:46] <wa5ted> and their background images may not always be the same
[09:44:02] <wa5ted> so id need a .each in that case right?
[09:44:10] <shoky> using .css with a function like i showed does the .each for you already
[09:44:49] <wa5ted> shoky: how come it doesnt work with an "external" function like i did
[09:45:44] <wa5ted> im so confused :(
[09:46:35] <shoky> the way you did it is equivalent to:  var el = $(this).parent(), bg = findBackground(el);  $(...).css("background", bg);
[09:46:52] <shoky> you're just using "this" in the outer scope
[09:47:05] <SirLagz>  why is my window.location.href = "http://blah" not working from within a $.getJSON success handler ? I can see firefox loading the redirected page, but I don't actually see it displayed
[09:47:17] <shoky> not in a function that changes "this", like  css does when you pass it a function. or .each does
[09:50:18] <wa5ted> shoky: okay...
[09:50:24] <wa5ted> so what should i do
[09:51:36] <shoky> code shit
[09:52:36] <wa5ted> sowhat you are saying is the scope is wrong
[09:52:43] <wa5ted> or not what i want it to be
[09:53:21] <shoky> in the outer scope, this === window. and you don't want to run your shit on window, right.
[09:53:36] <wa5ted> right
[10:12:14] <wa5ted> shoky: odd question: is ps there are layers and you can select certain layers and merge them, is there anyway to do this with say parent and grandparent backgrounds
[10:16:37] <shoky> donno what you mean.. doubt i'd know though. there are lots of new css stuff that could probably ... do stuff ;p
[10:24:44] <ronicu> hello, and Merry Christmas! :)
[10:28:29] <ronicu> $("#id").click() doesn't work if I try it from the console
[10:29:01] <ronicu> it shows me the HTML block for that id and nothing else
[10:29:23] <ronicu> I even tried $("#id").trigger("click") and no luck
[10:29:48] <ronicu> am I doing something wrong?
[11:30:44] <whatwhat> howdy
[11:53:30] <nikio_> why does this not work ? http://hastebin.com/ekuwefitij.xml im using that as the datepicker skin https://github.com/rtsinani/jquery-datepicker-skins .. if a div instead of an input is used, it works.
[15:18:01] <noobdev> Hello everyone!
[15:19:42] <noobdev> I have built a tic-tac-toe game for my learning practice, and managed to get it fully functional. The only bit left to add now is striking out the winning cells, and I'm not sure how to do that. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[15:33:47] <toothrot> noobdev, depends on what you've got ATM kinda
[15:34:53] <noobdev> toothrot: I'm just using divs for all the cells, so there are 9 divs laid out in a 3 x 3 grid in a container.
[15:35:21] <noobdev> So far, I've implemented all the functionality of the game, including checking for a win upon each move and announcing a winner whenever there is one.
[15:35:50] <noobdev> I guess my question would have more to do with CSS than JQuery but no one responded in #css so I thought it might be worth asking here too :D
[15:37:18] <noobdev> I'm using 'o' and 'x' characters for the noughts and crosses, so the divs I'd want to cross out would already have those as content in them...I'd have to somehow overlay another character or line or something on them for the crossing out effect
[15:40:09] <l330r> Can somebody tell me how I can display strings in paragraph tags with alternating ids?
[15:40:11] <l330r> or classes?
[15:53:51] <Nick___> happy holidays everyone. Have a question regarding .clone. Can someone help? Thank you.
[16:03:43] <Nick___> I am trying to clone an element that has a click event, but when I clone the element, the event is not copied over. I used clone(true) but it does not work. Could this be a bug? If you want more details, please message me.
[16:04:04] <Nick___> FYI, this is my first time in the IRC chat.
[16:05:43] <l330r> Create a jsfiddle?
[16:06:54] <Nick___> it is actually kinda hard to create a jsfiddle - I am testing the code on a third-party site . But I can point you to the website that I am having trouble with.
[16:07:21] <l330r> Uhh, sure. A copy of the script would be nice too.
[16:08:09] <Nick___> the site is: http://coupons.walmart.com I am trying to clone any of the coupons -> this for example: $('div#couponsinc-gallery-POD18620361');
[16:09:47] <l330r> Have you tried using $.ajax(); to get all the site contents and then do your clone?
[16:10:11] <Nick___> hmmm..no.
[16:10:30] <l330r> You should try that
[16:11:16] <Nick___> ok, just use $.ajax(); prior to clone the element? correct?
[16:11:35] <l330r> Hold on, lemmi mock something up
[16:12:02] <Nick___> ok
[16:15:45] <l330r> http://jsfiddle.net/xt36ntx2/
[16:17:20] <l330r> Try that
[16:18:16] <Nick___> ok...I tried this but nothing seems to be happening
[16:18:55] <l330r> I just made the basis of it
[16:18:58] <l330r> You have to do the rest.
[16:19:09] <l330r> Thats just connection the your url and doing a simple clone to a var
[16:20:38] <Nick___> ok. Shouldn't the cloned element appear in the output div?
[16:21:28] <l330r> Thats for you to figure out.
[16:38:44] <jiffe> is there a way to refresh jqplots without using so much memory?  If the tab isn't focused for a while and I reopen it, it takes a long time and windows complains about being low on memory
[17:16:06] <Nick___> thanks for your guidance l330r. So, I did run an ajax request and I am still unable to get the event copied over to my cloned element. Here is my code that I run on coupons.walmart.com: http://jsfiddle.net/xt36ntx2/5/ What do you guys think, is this a jquery bug?
[19:03:43] <l330r> Im using this http://pastebin.com/F0KHUGf2 to show all .mp3 files in a folder, but how can I get it to show all .mp3 files in subfolders?
[20:53:28] <CssNoob> Work!
