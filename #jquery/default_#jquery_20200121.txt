[09:43:25] <grid-> hey folks
[10:53:16] <elgatov> hi everyone, i posted a question in the jquery forum and it seems i cannot log in back to https://forum.jquery.com/, am i banned or something?
[15:27:44] <admin123> how can I build a form area that is covered in a semi opaque div but it gets uncovered once some state is triggered?
[15:28:18] <robertmaxrees> by doing exactly what you just said? lol care to be more specific with where you're getting hung up admin123?
[15:28:31] <admin123> I guess I want a demo
[15:28:37] <robertmaxrees> oh, bummer.
[15:28:42] <robertmaxrees> demo of what exactly?
[15:29:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to break the problem down into its component steps.
[15:30:43] <robertmaxrees> admin123
[15:42:25] <admin123> something like this https://jsfiddle.net/c2bztq5L/3/
[15:42:48] <robertmaxrees> so where are you getting stuck?
[15:45:26] <admin123> well the inputs are not "behind" the overlay message
[15:45:41] <robertmaxrees> okay, so your first issue is getting the overlay to work?
[15:47:16] <admin123> well now I kinda got it by writing the form first and making the message position absolute
[15:47:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> lots of tutorials out there on how to do exactly that.
[15:54:51] <admin123> done https://jsfiddle.net/c2bztq5L/6/
[15:55:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:55:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:09:35] <efrdfr> hi
[16:10:28] <efrdfr> Which is fastest : $("#image").css({height: '400px'}) or $("#image").height(400)
[16:10:38] <robertmaxrees> "fastest" as in...?
[16:11:23] <efrdfr> hi robertmaxrees
[16:12:35] <robertmaxrees> efrdfr mind clarifying your question?
[16:14:04] <efrdfr> Which one will run the fastest : $("#image").css({height: '400px'}) or $("#image").height(400)
[16:14:16] <robertmaxrees> repeating the question isn't going to help lol.
[16:14:24] <efrdfr> they both do the same
[16:14:38] <efrdfr> i suspect $("#image").css({height: '400px'})
[16:14:40] <efrdfr> is fastest
[16:14:45] <efrdfr> but not sure
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> well, are you running it thousands of times?  or just once?
[16:15:04] <efrdfr> just once
[16:15:15] <robertmaxrees> then why does performance, on the millisecond scale, matter? :)
[16:15:41] <efrdfr> cause it matter
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> not on that time scale.
[16:15:52] <efrdfr> i just want to know
[16:15:58] <robertmaxrees> completely imperceptible on that scale.
[16:16:03] <robertmaxrees> if you're really that concerned with perf, create a class and add/remove as needed.
[16:16:22] <efrdfr> I just want to know
[16:16:25] <robertmaxrees> but it's a totally silly micro benchmark.
[16:16:53] <efrdfr> to be honest, I try to learn jQuery to remove the library dependancy for a project
[16:17:20] <robertmaxrees> okay - then why are you asking about performance difference between two jquery methods?
[16:17:57] <efrdfr> for knowledge
[16:18:05] <efrdfr> I already tell you
[16:18:14] <efrdfr> please forgive my english
[16:18:14] <robertmaxrees> then go create a pointless microbenchmark and find out :)
[16:18:17] <efrdfr> i'm not native
[16:18:57] <robertmaxrees> but really, write code to be readable first.
[16:19:10] <robertmaxrees> don't preamturely optimize.
[16:24:36] <efrdfr> .css() is indeed fatest
[16:25:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:25:45] <robertmaxrees> now do it the right way and add/remove classes ;)
[16:26:00] <efrdfr> yes
[16:26:06] <efrdfr> i need your help
[16:26:11] <robertmaxrees> with?
[16:26:36] <efrdfr> there is just one line, i need to convert in vanilla
[16:26:51] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[16:27:37] <efrdfr> it's just this :
[16:29:08] <robertmaxrees> :|
[16:29:11] <robertmaxrees> i have to go to a meeting.
[16:29:13] <robertmaxrees> be back in a while.
[16:30:28] <efrdfr> lol
[16:30:33] <efrdfr> what a joke
[16:30:58] <efrdfr> it's not a problem, anyway I should do it myself
[16:33:23] <admin123> efrdfr: that's how you learn
[16:33:38] <efrdfr> indeed
[16:33:53] <admin123> benchmark it
[16:34:00] <admin123> do it in a loop and print stats
[16:34:09] <efrdfr> benchmark what ?
[16:35:00] <admin123> https://jsperf.com/string-reversal-agorithm
[16:35:07] <admin123> which is the fastest
[16:35:14] <efrdfr> i already do the test
[16:35:21] <efrdfr> css() method is fastest
[16:35:34] <efrdfr> or maybe I do it wronly
[16:35:44] <admin123> https://jsperf.com/prop-vs-ischecked
[16:37:37] <efrdfr> https://www.measurethat.net/Benchmarks/Show/6946/0/jquery---css-vs-height
[16:37:56] <efrdfr> If something is wrong, please tell me
[16:40:05] <efrdfr> no, it's height() that is fastest
[16:40:21] <efrdfr> hi robertmaxrees
[16:40:40] <efrdfr> what about your metting ?
[16:40:50] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[16:40:53] <robertmaxrees> lol it's over
[16:40:58] <robertmaxrees> you can ask questions to the channel.
[16:41:04] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[16:41:11] <efrdfr> your meeting is faster than alljQuery method
[16:41:15] <efrdfr> lol
[16:42:03] <robertmaxrees> so what did you need?
[16:42:24] <efrdfr> nothing
[16:42:28] <efrdfr> yet
[16:42:54] <robertmaxrees> what was a joke btw?
[16:43:12] <efrdfr> nothing
[16:43:48] <robertmaxrees> mmk
[16:44:43] <efrdfr> robertmaxrees https://www.measurethat.net/Benchmarks/Show/6946/0/jquery---css-vs-height
[16:44:49] <robertmaxrees> i saw that.
[16:44:54] <robertmaxrees> it's an asinine test :shrug:
[16:44:56] <efrdfr> height() is faster than css(), right ?
[16:45:03] <robertmaxrees> it's literally irrelevant.
[16:45:10] <efrdfr> why ?
[16:45:18] <robertmaxrees> you're running it once.
[16:45:36] <efrdfr> this
[16:45:37] <robertmaxrees> the user cannto tell the difference between the two.
[16:45:41] <efrdfr> it's the joke
[16:45:47] <efrdfr> i run it million time
[16:45:55] <efrdfr> please put it in your head
[16:46:01] <robertmaxrees> the user runs it once.
[16:46:10] <efrdfr> no it's like a malwae
[16:46:15] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: write code that's readable first.  don't prematurely optimize.
[16:46:19] <efrdfr> malware, it run infinitly
[16:46:31] <robertmaxrees> you're writing malware?
[16:52:29] <efrdfr> sorry i was on a meeting
[16:52:36] <efrdfr> no i'm not writing a malware
[16:52:45] <efrdfr> it's just an example
[16:52:54] <robertmaxrees> and a bad one ;)
[16:53:04] <efrdfr> yes
[16:53:26] <efrdfr> height() is faster than css(), right ?
[16:53:48] <robertmaxrees> it's absolutely irrelevant in the vast majority of cases.
[16:54:02] <efrdfr> yes
[16:54:15] <efrdfr> and for the few cases that rest
[16:54:17] <efrdfr> height() is faster than css(), right ?
[16:54:31] <robertmaxrees> i refuse to acknowledge that question ;)
[16:54:36] <robertmaxrees> moving on! :)
[17:03:23] <efrdfr> ok. I will go to the meeting
[17:04:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:04:46] <efrdfr> https://theintercept.com/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-running-president-wants-one-million-campaign-volunteers/
[17:05:00] <robertmaxrees> please keep things on topic - thank you!
[19:35:22] <karezza> Hello, I have a very niche question.  I'm working to put together a web page that uses websockets to interact with an API I've written.  As I develop the page with javascript & Chrome, after awhile it stops working.  It starts working again the next day.  However, I can use powershell to connect to the websocket server so I know the server is ok.
[19:36:16] <karezza> It is as if I'm using up a resource that gets used up... probably websockets not getting closed ...
[19:36:36] <karezza> I suspect everyone who develops something with websockets has ran into this ...
