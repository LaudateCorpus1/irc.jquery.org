[05:17:27] <Paradisee> hello guys
[05:17:39] <Paradisee> is it possible to get all inputs elements of a form?
[05:20:44] <Cork> $('form').prop('elements')
[05:21:01] <Cork> it can either be a list or the names of the input fields
[05:21:17] <Cork> (it also catches external input fields bound to the form)
[05:21:37] <Cork> if you just want input fields inside the form you can do something like $('form :input')

[05:24:05] <Cork> (btw you most likely want to wrap the element response in $() to be able to use normal jquery functions on it)
[05:42:57] <crs> Cork: Hi, it's me, still bothering you. :)
[11:37:30] <guest_17348> Can someone help me sort this array of objects? - https://jsfiddle.net/1L6jby05/
[11:37:52] <robertmaxrees> try ##javascript for that.
[11:38:03] <guest_17348> ok ty
[18:17:25] <dunga> Is this syntax correct in jQuery ....
[18:17:28] <dunga> var picklist = $('select.one');var chosen = $(picklist).filter('option:selected');
[18:17:44] <taplar> no, a select will not be an option
[18:18:00] <robertmaxrees> also: picklist is already a jquery object.
[18:18:08] <robertmaxrees> so you'd just need picklist.filter
[18:18:27] <dunga> thanks let me try it
[18:18:30] <robertmaxrees> but even better - you can get the value of the selected option by just doing var chosenValue = $('.one').val();
[18:19:06] <dunga> I have a problem that requires me to clone a picklist, manipulate the data and write it back.
[18:19:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm. alright.
[18:19:22] <dunga> I think I need to work with variables
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> oh?
