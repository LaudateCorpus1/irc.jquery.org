[00:30:36] <cgiGeek> .
[00:35:12] <cgiGeek> hmm how can I access an input type image value in jquery
[00:41:26] <Cork[home]> cgiGeek: you mean the x y attributes?
[00:42:10] <cgiGeek> yes, dont need the x or y number tho, have like 10 imput type submit, want to know which one is used to submit  to get the name for it
[00:42:18] <cgiGeek> err
[00:42:32] <cgiGeek> 10 input type image name=1, name=2 etc
[00:42:48] <cgiGeek> but the x or y will do as well
[00:42:54] <Cork[home]> $('input[name=""]')
[00:43:09] <cgiGeek> aC4c3ZY0_x = $form.find( \'input[name="aC4c3ZY0_x"]\' ).val()
[00:43:18] <cgiGeek> is not really picking it up
[00:43:52] <Cork[home]> uh so you want the value field?
[00:44:07] <cgiGeek> just a sample
[00:44:19] <Cork[home]> $('input[name=""]').prop('value')
[00:44:37] <cgiGeek> ok thanks, will play with that before bugging more
[00:44:38] <Cork[home]> i don't think val works on buttons
[00:45:15] <cgiGeek> i dont need the actual val, just to know which of the different input type image is used
[00:45:29] <cgiGeek> thanks a lot
[00:46:11] <Cork[home]> cgiGeek: what info do you have to check agenst then?
[00:46:26] <Cork[home]> cause the button won't say if its been pressed or not
[00:47:56] <cgiGeek> hmm
[00:50:46] <cgiGeek> let me put something up
[01:31:59] <jita> I am using jquery chosen but it only applies when the page loads, not dynamically. Here is the screenshot http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/842/selection008e.png/
[01:32:11] <jita> How can i apply the chosen script to the newly generated forms too ?
[01:36:38] <sente> i look forward to the day that imageshack.us dies
[01:37:54] <asdf`> It won't, ever. They have too much ad revenue to die. Let us hope they hire someone to rewrite the templates.
[01:40:20] <sente> nah
[01:40:32] <sente> let us hope everyone just stops using it
[01:42:11] <sente> less is more with photosites like that
[01:42:32] <sente> so i dont think the template really needs to be re-written so much as removed
[01:42:51] <jacky123> hi, i wanna do something complex. i have 2 boxes, 1 for html and another for css. as the user enters html and css code i want to show live preview as they add/edit the text in the textboxes. plus, after they are done, i want o use something like jcrop to allow the user define cropping co-ordinates (that will be sent to server on save). any idea how i can do so ?
[02:04:41] <jita> I have 2 forms, what i want to do is that when i save those forms, the value of one field from first form is stored in some field of the second form
[02:04:43] <jita> is it possible ?
[02:05:33] <cups> hey guys I have a selector that calls a method $("#AboutUsList a").fancybox()   I was to include the a's href in the fancybox call, is there an easy way to do it, $(this) doesn't seem to be working
[02:06:24] <cups> something like $("#AboutUsList a").fancybox({ href : $(this).attr('href').split('#') })
[02:06:42] <cups> is it because $(this) is referring to the method?
[02:09:00] <gour> morning
[02:09:10] <nickadeemus2002> hi
[02:11:03] <jita> can i set a field in the formset ?
[02:11:20] <jita> like formset.instance = foo.id
[02:11:30] <jita> so that all the forms in the formset get the value
[02:11:37] <jita> or should i have to iterate among them ?
[02:14:34] <gour> i'd like to learn some JS/jquery...have old pdf of learning-jquery book covering 1.3...is it still useful resource to learn jquery or (too) many things changed up to 1.7?
[02:16:02] <nickadeemus2002> jita: you should use a jquery selector to iterate form inputs:  $(form input]).each(function(){ // do your stuff here });
[02:16:20] <nickadeemus2002> gour: it should still be useful
[02:18:28] <gour> nickadeemus2002: thanks...what does it mean that to learn jquery "Basic knowledge of JavaScript and the document object model (DOM) is required." how much of JS is needed?
[02:18:47] <sente> jita: do you want to essentially "clone" one of the forms?
[02:19:19] <nickadeemus2002> gour:  well, you should know how javascript works in the browser
[02:19:37] <VeXii> gour: if you know stuff like loop's functions and scope it be fine i think
[02:19:51] <sente> 05:11 < jita> so that all the forms in the formset get the value
[02:19:51] <jita> sente, I have a form 'Recipe' which as a formset 'Ingredient'. So user can input as many ingredient formsets and when he submits, i would like that the related field in 'Ingredient' would automatically set to the newly generated recipe instance
[02:19:59] <CaffeinatedSky> Was curious if anyone knew why this wouldent work: http://jsfiddle.net/UtZ6r/1/. Quite a Jquery noob here.
[02:20:03] <nickadeemus2002> ---the most basic things you can do is to understand how to define variables, know when a variable is global/local, how to create functions, and understand function scope
[02:20:11] <nickadeemus2002> things like that will help.
[02:20:22] <CaffeinatedSky> It's a simple slideToggle for a navbar, link to actual website if needed.
[02:20:22] <jita> sente, which has a formset*
[02:20:24] <gour> ok...i've started reading eloquent JS and have Good Parts...what do you think or something else is recommended?
[02:21:06] <VeXii> CaffeinatedSky: youre missing the # infront of lol at line 3
[02:21:17] <nickadeemus2002> then you want to understand how the browser organizes elements using the Document Object Model
[02:21:30] <CaffeinatedSky> Vexii, I've seen some with them and some without them. Could you inform me when a # is needed?
[02:21:32] <nickadeemus2002> and understand the properties and methods of each element in the DOM.
[02:21:41] <VeXii> its like in css
[02:21:55] <VeXii> # if its a ID and . if its a class and so on
[02:22:17] <CaffeinatedSky> Roger, thanks Vexii! I'll go try that.
[02:22:35] <gour> nickadeemus2002, VeXii: thank you
[02:23:00] <nickadeemus2002> gour
[02:23:05] <nickadeemus2002> no problem
[02:23:13] <VeXii> anytime :)
[02:24:29] <CaffeinatedSky> Hmm, it's acting like #rofl has nothing in it.
[02:24:38] <CaffeinatedSky> It scrolls back up and then down.
[02:24:42] <sente> i'm n ot familiar with the term "formset", jita
[02:47:40] <VeXii> CaffeinatedSky: i just had a look at it, and it works in my end whith some small edits
[02:47:41] <VeXii> http://jsfiddle.net/UtZ6r/3/
[02:52:30] <CaffeinatedSky> Thanks Vexii, should have reported I found what the problem was. the <div> on each was getting in the way. Looking at what is causing that now.
[02:53:04] <CaffeinatedSky> Obviously some CSS Attribute I have assigned.
[03:08:19] <kitikonti> how can i post my plugin to the jquery site
[03:15:24] <stakkit> hello everyone
[03:15:57] <stakkit> can someone help me with the cycle plugin?
[03:16:25] <stakkit> i have this site: http://stakk.it/ .. click on image thumb with mouth... there should be a slideshow but not working.. I entered the code correctly but i dont know why dowsn't work...!
[03:16:40] <stakkit> I used the plugin cycle
[03:17:05] <stakkit> you can see in the jquery.custom.js
[03:17:50] <stakkit> the code begins with: jQuery(".slider").slides(function() {
[03:20:04] <stakkit> did you understand my problem? ... sorry for my bad english!
[03:20:09] <stakkit> :)
[03:23:36] <stakkit> awaiting for a reply
[03:25:01] <rworth> ?tell xaxxon jQuery UI adds support for using position as a setter. It's called the position utility
[03:25:01] <bot-t> rworth, Okay.
[03:31:52] <Slartibart> Hi. Is it possible to somehow fake(?) a document ready() or loaded() function for jquery ajax calls? I'm fetching a huge table and insert it with .html(), but it seems it takes so long for the browser to render the table that ajax .success() is called too early, it looks for html elements that aren't there yet.
[03:32:39] <poppiez> I've binded a click and dblclick event on an element. when double clicking, the click event fires twice and then the dblclick fires. any way to make this work so that only the dblclick event fires when actually double clicking?
[03:33:19] <Slartibart> Sorry, I was one step off there.. The ".ready()" function would be for my .html() call.
[03:37:41] <VeXii> well if you render it in the success call it suppose to be ready
[03:38:05] <rworth> ?tell TheJH the position utility (part of jQuery UI but standalone) adds setter support to position
[03:38:06] <bot-t> rworth, Okay.
[05:03:36] <Pawka> o/
[05:05:56] <Pawka> When I'm appending some html with .after(data), new DOM element will be created. So $(data) is not the same which was inserted to DOM tree. Is it possible to retrieve object which was appended?
[05:06:38] <Pawka> If I do not provide unique value like id or specific class.
[05:10:05] <arcanez> is there something built in or an idiom to allow me to make multiple getJSON requests until I get all the data back I want? (I am paging on the backend so my json responses aren't too large per request)
[05:17:59] <poppiez> can anyone tell me how to make this work: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. right now, the load event fires instantly after the first image has loaded. seems like 'this.complete' is acting weird. this is because I'm using the same image. if I do $('<img/>').one('... it works. any way to re-use one img?
[05:48:28] <Aquaguy> Hey there guys!
[05:48:48] <Aquaguy> Is there any way to delete all at once all attributes starting with 'data-' ?
[05:49:20] <Aquaguy> I know there is a way to select all elements with an attribute starting with some value, but dunno if the other thing is possible
[05:49:54] <Aquaguy> something like $('.foo').attr('data-*', '');
[05:51:17] <partydroid> Aquaguy, have you looked at  .attr( map )?
[05:51:21] <partydroid> mapA map of attribute-value pairs to set.
[05:51:33] <partydroid> you could probably do a foreach on them
[05:52:48] <Aquaguy> partydroid, ok, thank you
[05:53:02] <partydroid> ive never tried it, but give it a try ;)
[05:56:58] <poppiez> can anyone tell me how to make this work: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. right now, the load event fires instantly after the first image has loaded. seems like 'this.complete' is acting weird. this is because I'm using the same image. if I do $('<img/>').one('... it works. any way to re-use one img?
[06:10:18] <Flawless> I'm trying to insert an element in between other elements of a <ul>. This is working fine: $("#mylist").children(":nth-child(3)").after("<li>foo</li>")
[06:10:24] <Flawless> But I'd like it to fade in
[06:10:50] <Flawless> and for that, I used $("<li>foo</li>").hide().appendTo(...).show("slow")
[06:11:12] <Flawless> but appendTo inserts into, I'm looking for something like "afterTo" (I know the name doesn't make sense). Any ideas?
[06:14:48] <Flawless> Ah! insertAfter() :)
[06:31:25] <poppiez> I'm using one image object (var dummy = $('<img/>');) to handle image loads. I've created a wrapper that takes a path for an image and a callback. for some reason, when using a second image path on the image it thinks it has already loaded. why is this?
[06:31:37] <poppiez> here's what I'm doing: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q
[06:31:52] <poppiez> this.complete is true the second time I call loadImage even though it's a different image
[06:38:50] <poppiez> anyone?
[06:53:51] <Spadeski> May I get some help with sortable events ?
[06:53:54] <hendry> hi, looking for an example of a button that turns into a ticker so a long process doesn't get several submits... I hope I explained my problem :)
[07:02:38] <partydroid> ive got a question about parent and child elements.... and handling a click.
[07:02:48] <partydroid> imagine div.parent>div.child
[07:03:01] <partydroid> and i want to handle div.parent .click
[07:03:15] <partydroid> and is there a way to check that the click didnt happen in div.child?
[07:06:23] <partydroid> dont worry if(e.target==this)
[07:08:13] <Jayflux> anyone good with jQuery Ui tabs?
[07:11:30] <sente> partydroid: that's a good question, I've just spent a few minutes googling about this but I'm not really sure
[07:11:44] <partydroid> ive got an answer
[07:11:49] <sente> lemme hear it :)
[07:11:49] <partydroid>  if(e.target==this)
[07:12:21] <partydroid> e.target is the actual elem clicked
[07:12:44] <KyouJin-SaMa> hello guys
[07:13:12] <KyouJin-SaMa> I'm trying to use highcharts with data fetched from a server returning json
[07:13:12] <sente> but if you have an <div class=outer><div class=inner></div></div> and they both have handlers bound to the 'click' event, and youclick inside the inner div, both handlers will fire
[07:13:51] <KyouJin-SaMa> I'm new to jquery and i really can't figure out how to do that
[07:14:02] <partydroid> well i only wanted the outer, imagine inner only takes up half the size of outer
[07:14:16] <partydroid> inner has its own elements with click handlers too
[07:14:48] <KyouJin-SaMa> suppose i want to put a json object fetched using ajax into a variable, and then use this one for highcharts
[07:14:58] <partydroid> but if i $("div.outer").click(function(e){if (e.target==this) { //// }}); then i wont accidently fire off the handler when .inner is clicked
[07:15:04] <KyouJin-SaMa> how can i do That?
[07:15:28] <sente> well shouldn't you let jquery itself handle the "firing off" of events? just by binding the handlers?
[07:15:32] <partydroid> sente, i'm making a resizable column for my MySQL query browser http://snip.so/U4sC.png
[07:15:46] <sente> ooooh, i want
[07:15:50] <sente> is that open source?
[07:16:16] <Spadeski>  anyone here good with sortables ?
[07:19:22] <sl00> Hi. Yesterday I had a problem because I did not know arrays/objects are not automaticly cloned. But now I still have that issue when I send options to my widget (because I do not control $.Widget). According to http://forum.jquery.com/topic/inheritance-with-widget-and-options-of-type-array and its answers the issue should be solved but I still have the same problem??

[07:34:54] <hobs> cool advertising bro
[07:35:04] <lmatteis> do you guys use Keynote?
[07:35:11] <hobs> I do occasionally
[07:35:12] <lmatteis> how do i make a text of different background color?
[07:35:41] <hobs> do you mean make a box with a color
[07:35:46] <hobs> text is one color generally
[07:35:48] <lmatteis> like just a portion of text, like highlight a word
[07:36:00] <hobs> oh
[07:36:12] <hobs> so its like glowing or something
[07:36:28] <lmatteis> right
[07:36:43] <hobs> im trying to think of a better answer than the inspecto
[07:36:44] <hobs> r
[07:36:47] <hobs> let me grab ma mac
[07:39:47] <hobs> I think you can do it with the shadow feature of the inspector
[07:40:35] <hobs> otherwise use two text boxes
[07:40:41] <hobs> and you can define background colors of the boxes
[07:41:07] <hobs> or make a shape with that color you want and then send it backwards
[07:41:07] <lmatteis> hobs: hrm
[07:41:09] <hobs> behind your text
[07:41:14] <lmatteis> oh
[07:41:17] <lmatteis> intersting ok
[07:41:22] <goo6y> I'm trying to change the color of a .png icon in this KML file: http://pastebin.com/SaLJEhGg ... When I use the <color> tag, only the outline changes color, the center part stays black. How do I make it so the entire icon is orange and not only the border?

[07:49:20] <hobs> well im just a guy you know
[07:49:21] <hobs> let me google it
[07:49:44] <lmatteis> hobs: yeah cant find much with google :(
[07:50:52] <hobs> yeah google just said what I said basically
[07:51:14] <hobs> the best I could find is some other help about modifying shapes so they fit what you want when you highlight them

[08:15:03] <Rotham> hey... I am using .click to bind a handler function to a forms submit button.. how can I stop the normal click event from continuing?
[08:16:05] <ravenzz> use a submit button
[08:16:19] <ravenzz> and handle the submit event instead
[08:16:26] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ Rotham
[08:16:27] <bot-t> Rotham, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[08:16:52] <Rotham> awesome thank you
[08:24:31] <nexus74> Hello all
[08:26:15] <nexus2911> I have a jquery drop down menu - but instead of the menus dropping down, I went them to drop up.  should be pretty simple.  Here's my existing code: http://pastebin.com/eNNke4aZ
[08:26:38] <nexus2911> simply switching slideUp and slideDown isn't the answer...
[08:28:00] <Jon47> nexus2911 slideUp and slideDOwn just adjust the height of the div, you need to change how it's positioned if you want it to grow in a different direction
[08:28:20] <nexus2911> Jon47: Ok, thank you...so it's a CSS thing then
[08:28:35] <Jon47> (one option would be to position it absolutely and set it to position by the "bottom" value)
[08:29:27] <nexus2911> Here's my CSS: http://pastebin.com/4SmqCCwk
[08:30:46] <nexus2911> Jon47: this: ul.menu li ul is already positioned absoltue
[08:31:00] <nexus2911> ok now I set it to bottom...
[08:34:03] <tom__> does anyone here use PhpStorm?
[08:35:51] <nexus2911> Jon47: would you be able to give me a little more direction?
[08:44:53] <Jon47> nexus2911 if you can make a fiddle I'll help tweak it
[08:45:11] <nexus2911> Jon47: great..thank you
[08:46:22] <James13433> Hello, I am trying to get all select elements with name="super_attribute[85]" but due to the [85] bit its not working. jQuery(".product-options select[name=super_attribute[85]]") ,,,, "uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=super_attribute[85]]"
[08:46:44] <James13433> anyone know what I should be doing?
[08:48:01] <nexus2911> Jon47: the menu is in drupal, so I'll have to manually create the HTML part, unless all you need is the Jquery and CSS...
[08:48:20] <nexus2911> Jon47: The menu already works, just need to change animation direction...
[08:48:28] <Jon47> can i see the site?
[08:48:37] <nexus2911> Its a local site...lol
[08:48:56] <nexus2911> hold on I... I can probably just paste in the HTML from viewing page source...
[08:51:13] <Zeph88> I have a large file with lots of reps, wondering if anyone knows of a way to shorten this... http://pastebin.com/gZ8NYVgh (this is with only 2, there will be a total of 37 blocks exactly like this)
[08:52:54] <nexus2911> Jon47: Here it is, but having trouble getting it to run in jFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nBHnW/4/
[08:53:16] <James13433> Anyone?
[08:53:17] <DualDoctor> DUAL DOCTORS FROM DETROIT are in da house, mah homizzles!
[08:54:12] <DualDoctor> I made mah own jquery clone with mah own Sizzle so it has moore pazizzle than Barack's nizzle.
[08:56:53] <Jon47> nexus2911 yeah.. it'd be nice to see the issue before I start debugging
[08:57:05] <Jon47> if you can get it to work then let me know and i'll dig in
[08:58:47] <nexus2911> Jon47: ok
[09:03:32] <Zeph88> New question: If I grouped images inside of a div with an id, could I do a .hover action when any one of the images was hovered over, and get their ID?
[09:05:05] <Jon47> zeph88 certainly
[09:05:59] <Zeph88> Jon47: I am a bit confused as to how, $("#divid".img)?
[09:06:30] <Jon47> something like… divWithAnId.on('img', 'hover', hoverOverFunction, hoverOutFunction);
[09:06:56] <mattp_> is there any way to rerun document.ready()?
[09:08:00] <nexus2911> Jon47: got it working: http://jsfiddle.net/nBHnW/22/
[09:08:06] <Jon47> checking..
[09:08:18] <nexus2911> Jon47: you will have to scroll the result window to see the menu
[09:11:29] <nexus2911> Jon47: also, I think the jQuery code could be a lot simplier....
[09:11:43] <James13433> How would I set the selected option of a select dropdown, with Jquery?
[09:11:50] <nexus2911> Jon47: got this from a tutorial and adapted it to drupal 7
[09:11:59] <Jon47> nexus yeah this is a touch confusing to read through
[09:12:06] <Zeph88> Jon47: To make sure I understand you: http://pastebin.com/Bb3UUKVz ?
[09:12:28] <James13433> needs to be based on the acctual text e.g Black not the values="45"
[09:12:49] <nexus2911> Jon47: I did this without injecting any additional CSS classes into drupals menu
[09:12:54] <Jon47> zeph actually i think hover is not an event
[09:13:05] <Jon47> you'll have to pass two events as a string, e.g. "mouseenter mouseout"
[09:13:11] * James13433 feels invisable
[09:13:14] <Jon47> then check the event type in the single function
[09:13:41] <nexus2911> James13433: do you need help?
[09:13:55] <James13433> Indeed nexus2911,
[09:14:05] <nexus2911> James13433: ok...shoot
[09:14:08] <James13433> ill do a pastebin quickly..
[09:15:38] <nexus2911> Jon47: so, if it is a positioning issue, maybe the primary focus is on CSS instead of jQuery...
[09:15:49] <chipnt> hi Zeph88
[09:16:00] <Zeph88> Hello chi
[09:16:13] <Jon47> nexus2911 check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/nBHnW/23/
[09:16:22] <Jon47> is that what you were thinking of?
[09:16:37] <Jon47> you're correct, it's totally a css issue
[09:16:44] <Jon47> if i udnerstand you correctly, that is...
[09:16:46] <James13433> for jsfiddle, i should set onLoad right ?
[09:17:07] <nexus2911> Jon47: sweet!  so now I just need to position those subs above the parent items - the animation direction is now correct
[09:17:11] <chipnt> Zeph88 for the things that are very similar you can create a function and pass arguments onto that function
[09:17:14] <nexus2911> Jon47: Thank you!
[09:17:24] <chipnt> so one function does several stuff depending on the arguments passed
[09:17:35] <Jon47> just adjust the "bottom" attribute in the rule for "ul.menu li ul"
[09:19:02] <Kage> http://pastebin.com/7hPYEtZC doesn't work but it doesn't generate a error either
[09:20:12] <James13433> nexus2911, first of I need to make this jsfiddle work so I can show the example, but its not :/ http://jsfiddle.net/UpmUt/
[09:21:10] <nexus2911> Jon47: Perfect!  Now I just have an issue with the submenus collapsing when I move my mouse away from the parent link...I've gotten around this before by setting the height of some element - but I was guessing
[09:21:37] <nexus2911> James13433: what are you trying to accomplish?
[09:21:50] <James13433> Ok, so http://jsfiddle.net/UpmUt/1/
[09:22:22] <James13433> I need to make it so I can update that by using "Black" or "Red" instead of the 13, or 14 nexus2911
[09:23:03] <Jon47> zeph88 this is a very simple example whcih you don't need js for, but it shows the concept: http://jsfiddle.net/VPYpe/
[09:23:20] <nexus2911> James13433: I'm kinda new to jQuery...perhaps use another property besides .val
[09:24:30] <nexus2911> Jon47: thank you for all your help!
[09:25:04] <James13433> been googling nexus2911 but I can find one.
[09:25:06] <Jon47> np buddy
[09:25:31] <James13433> jon47, feel free to help me too ha
[09:26:20] <nexus2911> James13433: this? http://api.jquery.com/text/
[09:26:54] <James13433> sadly not nexus2911, try it on my jsfiddle you will see
[09:27:30] <Jon47> James13433 i'll check your fiddle out, haven't been keeping up with the thread tho
[09:28:06] <ryanneufeld> James13433: can you just change the html to have colors in the value feild?
[09:28:06] <bot-t> (14 hours 10 mins ago) <coldhead> tell ryanneufeld CONGRATULATIONS BUDDY!!! NFL 4 LIFE
[09:28:23] <nexus2911> Jon47: one last question...if you can help then great, if not I understand.  I've set that bottom property to 75px (was -75px) now when I mouse away from parent item, the submenus immediately collapse...
[09:28:29] <ryanneufeld> ?tell coldhead I'm not in the NFL!!!
[09:28:29] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[09:28:32] <James13433> dont think you need to have been really Jon47, http://jsfiddle.net/UpmUt/1/ want to change it from updating with 13, to "Black","Red" or alike
[09:29:06] <ryanneufeld> James13433: can you just change the html?
[09:29:41] <James13433> ryanneufeld, no would be a pain the the backside i think as its in a cms, and the cms is using the 13 etc for somthing else I belive.
[09:30:36] <ryanneufeld> James13433: you're gonna have to iterate over each of the options
[09:30:44] <ryanneufeld> to find one where the text matches
[09:31:45] <James13433> right ok :/
[09:32:32] <zulax> i am looking at making an interactive quiz for kids
[09:32:36] <James13433> just remembers I did this in the past on the same attribute.... code search
[09:32:40] <zulax> anything already out there that i could make use of
[09:32:50] <James13433> ahh no I didn't :/
[09:33:01] <zulax> also i m thinking of using js game engine, is that a overkill?
[09:33:03] <nexus2911> zulax: that is a very broad questing
[09:33:20] <DCC_SEND> I'm trying to change the color of a .png icon in this KML file: http://pastebin.com/SaLJEhGg ... When I use the <color> tag, only the outline changes color, the center part stays black. How do I make it so the entire icon is orange and not only the border?
[09:33:31] <DCC_SEND> Why won't anyone answer!
[09:33:42] <James13433> ryanneufeld, how would I even get that bit of text, to check if it matches in the first place?
[09:33:44] <DCC_SEND> no matter where I ask, even in #google or #chromium or #googlemaps
[09:34:08] <nexus2911> zulax: a simple quiz can be done in PHP, JavaScript, or any othe rscripting language
[09:34:37] <ryanneufeld> James13433: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/UpmUt/2/
[09:34:46] <zulax> nexus2911, well my options were flash and js,
[09:34:47] <Kage> DCC_SEND: You don't give enought time to anwser, also use CSS, <color> isn't a valid tag IIRC
[09:35:08] <ryanneufeld> DCC_SEND: not only that, but last time you came inhere asking that question, you just spammed the channel
[09:35:11] <nexus2911> zulax: ok, well you know Flash is no longer being dev'd for mobile devices, correct?
[09:35:14] <James13433> awsome ryanneufeld, thanks !!!
[09:35:20] <zulax> nexus2911, yup
[09:35:30] <nexus2911> zulax: so that answers that question...
[09:35:34] <ryanneufeld> DCC_SEND: you are not entitled to help, and being demanding only makes us want to ingnore you
[09:35:58] <zulax> nexus2911, right, and i was thinking if there is stuff i could reuse instead of making all by myself from scratch
[09:36:13] <nexus2911> zulax: oh I'm sure there is...
[09:36:21] <nexus2911> zulax: jus a sec..
[09:36:30] <zulax> nexus2911, maybe i am not sure how to search for them :(
[09:36:33] <ryanneufeld> DCC_SEND: this is not the place to be asking that question any way. This channel is for #jquery, not KML
[09:36:41] <partydroid> DCC_SEND, please stop spamming me
[09:37:02] <nexus2911> zulax: this looks old: http://www.javascriptsource.com/miscellaneous/basic-javascript-quiz.html?percentage=&solutions=%250A
[09:37:20] <nexus2911> zulax: just google "create online quiz using javascript"
[09:37:23] <ryanneufeld> partydroid: /ignore *!*@182.7.14.12
[09:37:23] <nexus2911> or jquery
[09:37:35] <zulax> thanks for those
[09:37:42] <partydroid> already done
[09:37:44] <nexus2911> zulax: np
[09:37:57] <zulax> I am hoping to make something more interactive
[09:38:11] <zulax> if possible, game like so the kids will be engaged nexus2911
[09:38:22] <zulax> so i might need to use game engines?
[09:38:22] <ryanneufeld> James13433: np, a warning though, probably not the fastest solution
[09:38:27] <nexus2911> I bet jquery is the perfect choice zulax
[09:38:55] <zulax> nexus2911, and it would run on mobile devices also? touch screens
[09:39:02] <nexus2911> zulax: YUP
[09:39:24] <nexus2911> zulax: you have to make sure your "clicks" are touches compatible...
[09:39:46] <Zeph88> Jon47: Sorry for lack of response. Thanks for the help. it works well in your example but dies on my page, very confusing. It's okay though, I think I'm going with plan a and having php generate the blocks :-P
[09:39:55] <zulax> nexus2911,  do i do that in the code itself?
[09:39:59] <nexus2911> zulax: I just did that not too long ago...
[09:40:03] <nexus2911> zulax: yes
[09:40:17] <nexus2911> zulax: its not complicated
[09:40:22] <zulax> ok
[09:40:30] <nexus2911> zulax: do you have any programming experience?
[09:40:33] <ajpiano> so did DCC_SEND just like pm everyone in the channel?
[09:40:50] <ryanneufeld> not me
[09:40:53] <partydroid> he's just been kicked
[09:40:56] <ryanneufeld> good
[09:41:01] <ryanneufeld> he was spamming eariler too
[09:41:05] <zulax> nexus2911, yes, alot of web dev (php, ajax, jquery, cs, js)
[09:41:20] <zulax> nexus2911, but never had to make a game
[09:41:22] <nexus2911> zulax: bro...this will be a drop in the bucket for you then...
[09:41:42] <ryanneufeld> zulax: check out zinga's frameworks if you're building a game
[09:41:50] <ryanneufeld> they have some pretty good stuff
[09:41:58] <zulax> i will, just a sec
[09:41:59] <ryanneufeld> I haven't worked with it personally
[09:42:06] <nexus2911> zulax: this depends on the complexity of the quiz / interactivity
[09:42:13] <ryanneufeld> but I took a look and they have some cool stuff
[09:42:22] <ryanneufeld> not sure if it's relevant to you
[09:42:36] <Jon47> Zeph88 usually a good idea to do things server-side when you can
[09:42:36] <nexus2911> zulax: can you give me an example of what happens in your quiz?
[09:43:24] <zulax> nexus2911, i am hoping like kids will be able to drag and place the right answer for the question in the right place
[09:43:35] <zulax> or shoot at the right option nexus2911
[09:43:53] <zulax> actually, i still need to come up with gamy ways for a quiz
[09:44:55] <nexus2911> zulax: ah...still not as complicated as "game" that you may be thinking of...
[09:45:28] <nexus2911> zulax: when you say game, I think of levels / enemy AI /  multi-player / acheivements, etc.
[09:45:43] <zulax> ryanneufeld, u know what their framework is called? and is it opensouce
[09:46:01] <zulax> nexus2911, well, yes it wont be complicated at all
[09:46:04] <ryanneufeld> ?g zynga game framework
[09:46:05] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Open Source at Zynga | Zynga Engineering - http://code.zynga.com/2011/11/open-source-at-zynga-3/
[09:46:09] <nexus2911> zulax:
[09:47:17] <zulax> thanks
[09:47:21] <DCC_SEND> funny
[09:47:28] <DCC_SEND> They try to K-Line me but I can reset my cable modem
[09:47:43] <Haraldson> who is this annoying guy?
[09:48:05] <zulax> looks like jquery might be good option then
[09:48:14] <nexus2911> Haraldson: someone who wasn't loved as a child
[09:48:17] <zulax> instead of using complicated engines for such small games
[09:48:44] <nexus2911> zulax: yeah, start with a minimal test case...just keep everything simple
[09:49:19] <zulax> nexus2911, i did a mock with limejs , uses closure and very powerful(works of mobile right away)
[09:49:29] <zulax> but looked like an overkill and also there is less support for it
[09:50:12] <nexus2911> zulax: well with frameworks, you have the possibility of a bug being in the framework...instead of your code.  It's not always easy to tell the difference
[09:50:46] <nexus2911> zulax: trust me...I've been playing with Objective C and Chipmunk physics engine...It happens
[09:50:48] <zulax> yup, that scares me, and what if they discontinue it or .... jquery is here to stay atleast
[09:50:58] <nexus2911> zulax: that's right...
[09:51:31] <nexus2911> zulax: when using someone else's code...if you don't know WHY something works, you won't know why it DOESN'T work
[09:52:10] <zulax> true
[09:52:14] <necromancer> nexus2911: that's one of the pitfalls with the cocoa touch framework. one of the reasons why i love ruby on rails is because i can look at the annotated source for every function right in the docs. all i have to do is click the link and it reveals it
[09:52:44] <necromancer> i guess i never noticed with jQuery because it's simple enough that i already understand what it's doing behind the scenes
[09:52:53] <necromancer> hell, half of the library's just syntactic sugar
[09:52:55] <nexus2911> necromancer: yeah, well sometimes the frameworks come with documentation.. but it's hit and miss
[09:53:12] <nexus2911> necromancer: Yeah, Jquery seems pretty close to the wire
[09:53:23] <necromancer> nexus2911: are you talking about 3rd-party app frameworks for like iOS? or game programming frameworks for mobile/HTML5?
[09:53:40] <Zeph88> Jon47: The more I think about this the more it seems rediculous, do you see what I'm doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/bMmtCVGL any form of just .on(blah is killing the script completely
[09:53:43] <nexus2911> necromancer: both
[09:54:14] <nexus2911> necromancer: anytime you use a framework, you run the risk of bugs in the framework...making it difficult to determine if the problem is your code or the frameworks
[09:54:33] <nexus2911> necromancer: I'm not discounting frameworks at all, just an observation
[09:55:23] <necromancer> nexus2911: true. i still think it's worth it to learn one of these game frameworks if you're gonna be making games for HTML5. we just don't know what apple or mozilla or MS is gonna do with their browser
[09:55:43] <necromancer> obj-c on the other hand is different
[09:55:57] <necromancer> you're guaranteed that a little apple logo is going to be on the machine your app runs in
[09:56:19] <necromancer> in that case i question whether you need any more frameworks than what they give you
[09:56:29] <nio> ciao
[09:56:33] <necromancer> but i'm not an obj-c dev (yet) so i don't know :)
[09:56:47] <nexus2911> necromancer: oh yes...you're gonna want Cocos2D, Chipmunk for physics, etc
[09:57:12] <nexus2911> necromancer: just in case you get into Obj-C, you're gonna want those frameworks for games
[09:57:23] <necromancer> intersting
[09:57:33] <necromancer> interesting*
[09:57:37] <marienz> bah, typo. Looks like it did no damage though.
[09:57:46] <nexus2911> necromancer: actually SpaceManger (which is Chipmunk) is great
[09:57:57] <necromancer> nexus2911: i really like Xcode but objective-c is still strange to me
[09:58:04] <nexus2911> necromancer: how so
[09:58:10] <necromancer> nexus2911: its over-verbose syntax bothers me
[09:58:20] <nexus2911> necromancer: yeah...some would call Obj0
[09:58:22] <nexus2911> oops
[09:58:36] <nexus2911> necromancer: Some would call ObjC more of a wrapper around C
[09:59:11] <necromancer> Ruby: x = Object.new; JS: var x = new Object() || Object.create(); Objective-C: __NSCFConstantString * myLittleStringThatIMade = [[NSString alloc] init]
[09:59:13] <necromancer> ;
[09:59:15] <necromancer> :)
[09:59:28] <nexus2911> lol
[09:59:29] <necromancer> nexus2911: that's what C++ is, right?
[09:59:46] <necromancer> a wrapper around C
[09:59:52] <nexus2911> necromancer: well C++ is C with classes
[10:00:03] <necromancer> objective-c is at least an organizational improvement over C++
[10:00:28] <nexus2911> They guy that tutors me on ObjC argues that it is more of wrapper...when he does so, he sets the channel ablaze...lol
[10:01:20] <necromancer> but like
[10:01:22] <necromancer> [] is not in C
[10:01:31] <nexus2911> ahh...the brackets
[10:01:35] <necromancer> shouldn't it look more like C if it's "just a wrapper"?
[10:01:42] <necromancer> i mean that's a pretty crazy wrapper
[10:01:54] <nexus2911> well that's his arguement...not necessarily mine
[10:01:59] <necromancer> that's like when you get a diamond ring packaged in 6 boxes and the biggest one is 15" x 20"
[10:02:13] <nexus2911> lol
[10:02:15] <Rembane> :D
[10:02:19] <necromancer> that's a WRAPPER
[10:02:23] <necromancer> ;-)
[10:02:43] <nexus2911> :)
[10:03:05] <nexus2911> [myObj myMethod]
[10:03:23] <nexus2911> seems pretty straight forward to me...but then again, I learned on ObjC for OOP
[10:03:33] <nexus2911> probably not the best starter language
[10:03:42] <necromancer> i started on C/C++
[10:03:57] <necromancer> quickly moved to JavaScript when it was first coming out because C++ was waaaay too hard for my 12 year old brain
[10:04:06] <nexus2911> yeah, so it's no surprise you find the syntax somewhat foreign
[10:04:14] <necromancer> i'm used to object.method()
[10:04:36] <necromancer> objective-c does have dot notation but only for properties
[10:04:42] <nexus2911> Yeah, I was programming in Quick Basic back in the day - working at BestBuy, when a Borland rep gave my C++
[10:05:10] <James13433> How would I say, get next select box on the page?
[10:05:20] <nexus2911> I tried going from qBasic to C++...forget it
[10:05:24] <necromancer> nexus2911: i wouldn't say Obj-C isn't the best starter language...it's sort of like learning C# or Java as your starter OOP language. best to learn in a language that forces your paradigm...
[10:05:49] <ravenzz> ?next @ James13433
[10:05:50] <bot-t> James13433, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[10:05:58] <necromancer> in C++ you can get away with procedural style, and in Ruby/Python you can get away with all kinds of different styles
[10:06:14] <nexus2911> necromancer: yeah...C# is .net language - so that means it requires a runtime enviornment...not crazy about that
[10:06:31] <necromancer> well, they all do...
[10:06:37] <necromancer> objective-c's is just built into the OS
[10:06:46] <necromancer> Java requires a VM too
[10:07:10] <necromancer> C is still the closest thing to the hardware other than assembly
[10:07:25] <nexus2911> wouldn't you say though, that ObjC program runs natively on the hardware?  no separete runtime layer...?
[10:07:36] <Symbi0nt|GER> is {'€': '&euro;'} valid json (key is the euro symbol)
[10:07:49] <nexus2911> without a doubt C is at the wire
[10:07:51] <necromancer> Symbi0nt|GER: run it through jsonlint?
[10:08:21] <volkan> Hey! How can i get the current element in animates step function. 'this' isn't referencing to the current element
[10:08:33] <Symbi0nt|GER> okay it is
[10:08:37] <Symbi0nt|GER> thanks for the website
[10:08:39] <Symbi0nt|GER> hint
[10:09:38] <James13433> Anyone?
[10:09:45] <James13433> oh sorry didnt see that
[10:09:51] <nexus2911> necromancer: nice talking with ya...gotta run... If you get into ObjC and you see me here, you'll have to hit me up....
[10:10:00] <necromancer> ok
[10:10:07] <necromancer> hey wikiepdia sez "Objective-C is a thin layer on top of C, and moreover is a strict superset of C; it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler, and to freely include C code within an Objective-C class."
[10:10:17] <James13433> ravenzz, I need the next select, not the next select that is a sibling.
[10:12:26] <ajpiano> James13433: the only way to get "next" elements that aren't siblings is to have a collection of all the elements
[10:12:35] <ajpiano> and use the index of the one you have to get the next one
[10:13:06] <ajpiano> var selects = $("select"), index = selects.index(this), nextSelect = selects.eq( index + 1 );
[10:13:33] <James13433> Thanks ajpiano
[10:14:32] <DualDetroit> Yo yo yo, Dual Detroit be in da house, kickin' it down to Vogue with mah homizzles.
[10:14:57] <Rembane> oO
[10:15:24] * DualDetroit built his own jQuery clone, called DualSizzle, built on Sizzle, to have more pazizzzle than Barack's nizzle.
[10:16:48] <DualDetroit> So I have a question: Does Jquery love XHTML?
[10:18:23] <James13433> ajpiano, If the selects where all stucrured like this http://jsfiddle.net/BAPGE/1/ , would there be a be a better way to get the next one?
[10:18:37] <ajpiano> not really
[10:19:13] <ajpiano> depends if you consider $(this).parent().nextAll("dd").first().find("select") "better"
[10:19:13] <ajpiano> :p
[10:19:38] <James13433> Well thats what am asking, would tha be quicker.
[10:19:48] <James13433> Im guessing not ha
[10:20:01] <ajpiano> depends on whether you cache the initial collection of selects at the beginning, etc.
[10:20:13] <ajpiano> if you really care about perf, benchmark your stuff after
[10:20:17] <ajpiano> :p
[10:20:41] <rabbit123> Hello :) I am looking for a way to move/rearrange similar size divs
[10:20:57] <rabbit123> Is there such function in Jquery
[10:21:13] <ajpiano> there are many functions related to that task
[10:21:23] <ajpiano> but there is no such thing as moveSimilarSizeDivs
[10:21:57] <James13433> im a little confused how to get the index of var colorSelect = jQuery("#attribute85"); for example ajpiano
[10:22:29] <ajpiano> you have to use the entire set
[10:22:45] <James13433> right...
[10:23:01] <James13433> at the top i have var selects = $("select");
[10:23:11] <ajpiano> var sel = $("#attribute85"), selects = $("select"), select.index( sel[0]) );  or actually i think $("#attribute85").index( "select") works too
[10:25:39] <James13433> thanks ajpiano got it working cool.
[10:30:02] <James13433> ryanneufeld remember me?
[10:30:29] <James13433> I need to make javascript treat colorSelect.val(this.value); asif a user selected it :/
[10:30:49] <ryanneufeld> James13433: yeah
[10:30:59] <ryanneufeld> so, do that then ;P
[10:31:06] <ajpiano> .val("foo").trigger("change')
[10:31:25] <ryanneufeld> ^^ that is probably what you want
[10:31:32] <ryanneufeld> I'm a little out of context right now
[10:31:39] <ajpiano> so am i
[10:31:54] <James13433> lol, sorry
[10:32:19] <turboneat> Gentlemen.
[10:32:40] <ryanneufeld> watch your mouth
[10:32:41] <turboneat> What do you guys recommend for a drop-down menu with jquery ui
[10:32:56] <ryanneufeld> we're not all gentlemen :p
[10:33:01] <James13433> didn't do what I was expecting :/
[10:33:07] <ajpiano> turboneat: there's a jquery ui select menu in development
[10:33:29] <ajpiano> but not released or anything like that
[10:33:31] <ryanneufeld> turboneat: superfish is a good meny plugin
[10:33:36] <ryanneufeld> but it's not jquery-ui
[10:33:45] <ajpiano> turboneat: this is really nice http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[10:33:48] <ryanneufeld> James13433: do you have a fiddle?
[10:33:50] <ajpiano> oh
[10:33:56] <ajpiano> we're talking about drop down menus, not... selects
[10:34:00] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[10:35:03] <ryanneufeld> heating blanket wrapped around cold feet == me happier than a tornado in a trailer park
[10:35:25] <ryanneufeld> turboneat: you could also look at hoverintent to create your own if you wanted
[10:35:40] <luite> there's also a selectmenu for jquery-ui
[10:35:42] <luite> 1.9
[10:36:05] <ryanneufeld> 1.9 doesn't even have a release date yet
[10:36:28] <James13433> I have this from before http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/UpmUt/2/ ajpiano
[10:36:32] <turboneat> i think superfish should work out for me
[10:36:50] <luite> ryanneufeld: I still use it since the site I'm working on doesn't have one either ;p
[10:37:06] <James13433> but that wont show, the bit I need to work on change, because to be frank I dont even know where that bit of code is coming from at the moment, its some random js file in my cms
[10:37:14] <ajpiano> what
[10:37:17] <ryanneufeld> James13433: what is the behaviour you want that isn't happening?
[10:37:28] <ajpiano> ryry you get to take this one
[10:37:29] <ajpiano> lol
[10:37:29] <ajpiano> :p
[10:37:38] <ryanneufeld> Thanks ajpiano
[10:37:46] <turboneat> thanks, gentlemen! (and others regardless of gender, race, or disposition)
[10:37:54] <James13433> ryanneufeld,  when the color select is selected, the next dropdown, "frame size" should be enabled and populated.
[10:37:59] * ryanneufeld tips hat to turboneat
[10:38:15] <ryanneufeld> James13433: can you give me a demo of this not happening?
[10:38:28] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ James13433

[10:38:41] <James13433> I can ryanneufeld, but you will have to give me 20 to upload my site and database.
[10:38:58] <ryanneufeld> can you provide a simplified use case on jsfiddle?
[10:39:05] <James13433> oh I cant give you a pastebin demo no :(
[10:39:19] <James13433> jsfiddle*
[10:39:29] <ryanneufeld> oic
[10:39:48] <ryanneufeld> k, lemme know when you have something you can show me then, and I'll take a look
[10:41:09] <James13433> ok 7000 files to go...
[10:42:06] <ryanneufeld> 7000!?!?!?!
[10:42:13] <ryanneufeld> What CMS are you using?
[10:42:19] <James13433> Ha, yeah, and thats just the theme files.
[10:42:22] <James13433> Magento
[10:42:38] <ryanneufeld> I was 1/2 expecting eZPublish
[10:42:46] <ryanneufeld> gebus
[10:43:19] * James13433 looks up eZPublish
[10:44:10] <ryanneufeld> James13433: don't do it
[10:44:12] <ryanneufeld> save yourself
[10:44:32] <James13433> Ha that good ey
[10:44:38] <ryanneufeld> I used to dev on it
[10:44:46] <ryanneufeld> the default install has over 100 DB tables
[10:45:01] <James13433> Haha, 100 is that all , try 330!
[10:45:15] <[algo]> hi
[10:45:28] <[algo]> I've got a deferred which calls fail().done()
[10:45:29] <ryanneufeld> and requires you to increase the PHP memory per script to over 128MB just to install it
[10:45:37] <[algo]> can I somehow make done be called in fail?
[10:46:02] <ryanneufeld> .always
[10:46:03] <[algo]> I mean, can I process the error in fail somehow that the control flow goes to done() ?
[10:46:09] <[algo]> I know always
[10:46:22] <[algo]> is it the only way?
[10:46:24] <James13433> ha 128 just to install,  f*** a duck

[10:47:10] <[algo]> mmm for me it's [ tab

[10:48:00] <[algo]> ok, actually I want the following
[10:48:17] <[algo]> I want $.when(d1...dn) to call call resulting function with all results
[10:48:22] <[algo]> some of them may be errors
[10:48:30] <ryanneufeld> then you want always
[10:48:36] <[algo]> a moment I'll check
[10:48:46] <ryanneufeld> that's what it does
[10:49:23] <ryanneufeld> wether $.when() resolves or not, functions passed to always will get called every time
[10:49:40] <[algo]> http://jsfiddle.net/xRWDc/
[10:49:55] <[algo]> please, note that I get only one result
[10:49:58] <turboneat> so do you guys recommend something like bootstrap for layout?
[10:50:33] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: use console.log() instead of alert
[10:51:05] <[algo]> http://jsfiddle.net/xRWDc/1/
[10:51:07] <[algo]> here you are
[10:52:08] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: you need one function for each deferred
[10:52:26] <[algo]> ryanneufeld: what you mean?
[10:52:38] <[algo]> many functions to when ?
[10:53:04] <[algo]> could you please fix the demo?
[10:54:26] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: I'm looking at it now

[10:59:11] <James13433> ryanneufeld, can I pm you an url?
[10:59:17] <ryanneufeld> sure
[10:59:45] <ryanneufeld> oh, this again
[11:00:10] <ryanneufeld> wait, wrong window
[11:00:20] <ryanneufeld> James13433: so what should be happening and what isn't happen?
[11:03:45] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: http://danheberden.com/presentations/jqsummit-deferreds-in-jquery/#27
[11:04:01] <ryanneufeld> I think you're doing something fishy with the the deferreds here
[11:04:12] <[algo]> already got some
[11:04:18] * [algo] fishing in sources
[11:04:25] <[algo]> 1.7 sources for deferred are much more clear
[11:04:32] <[algo]> thanks to $.Callbacks
[11:05:23] <ryanneufeld> k I was gonna suggest that as well
[11:05:36] <[algo]> are all jqsummit presentations available?
[11:05:44] <[algo]> maybe videos?
[11:05:45] <ryanneufeld> if you attended yes
[11:05:55] <ryanneufeld> you'll get an email with the deets
[11:06:18] <[algo]> I haven't
[11:09:39] <[algo]> I believe pipe can help me
[11:09:40] <[algo]> only pipe
[11:09:54] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: yeah, I just looked at it
[11:09:56] <ryanneufeld> here's the thing
[11:10:05] <[algo]> watching the presentatin
[11:10:07] <ryanneufeld> if you use always, and if fails
[11:10:10] <partydroid> with the attribute selector, do you have to have a value?
[11:10:14] <[algo]> well, best realization of deferreds is jsdeferred
[11:10:16] <ryanneufeld> you only get the params for the fail
[11:10:19] <partydroid> can you search for all elements with that attribute?
[11:10:24] <[algo]> jquery is one of worst deferred realizations
[11:10:34] * [algo] working with deferreds for 5 years
[11:10:36] <ryanneufeld> ?tryit@ partydroid

[11:10:55] <ryanneufeld> damnit
[11:10:58] <ryanneufeld> partydroid: just try  it
[11:11:17] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: then use something else ;)
[11:11:36] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: as it stands right now, it seems that you only get one or the other with always
[11:11:50] <[algo]> ryanneufeld: hehe I have jquery
[11:12:16] * [algo] will learn to flow round it's rough corners
[11:12:27] <Zeph88> Is it possible for another script to take control of somthing like .bind("touchstart"... ?
[11:12:53] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: deferreds in jquery are still rather young, so if you have a better way, patches are welcome and encourages
[11:12:55] <ryanneufeld> *encouraged
[11:13:03] <[algo]> I talked with jaubourg
[11:13:07] <[algo]> or like that
[11:13:13] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:13:14] <ryanneufeld> that's the guy
[11:13:22] <[algo]> suggested a couple of ideas, but didn't work
[11:13:35] <[algo]> he doesn't seem to like it
[11:13:59] <[algo]> for example, in JQ we have pipe
[11:14:05] <[algo]> other deferreds do not have pipe
[11:14:10] <[algo]> that's wrong to have it
[11:14:19] <[algo]> any callback may return a deferred
[11:14:33] <[algo]> and if it does, this deferred is inserted into async chain
[11:14:34] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: why is it wrong to have added functionality?
[11:14:45] <[algo]> other libraries do not need it
[11:14:54] <[algo]> in other libs, done/fail can return deferred
[11:14:57] <[algo]> see ?
[11:15:06] <ryanneufeld> you can do that in jq as well
[11:15:11] <[algo]> done returning deferred ?
[11:15:21] <[algo]> and next done will use THAT deferred's result?
[11:15:40] <ryanneufeld> okay, I see what you're saying. That doesn't make it wron
[11:15:47] <[algo]> that happens in all libs
[11:15:50] <[algo]> except jquery
[11:15:57] <ryanneufeld> use them then
[11:15:58] <ryanneufeld> ?
[11:16:09] <[algo]> they have advantage in it indeed
[11:16:25] <[algo]> ok let's make jquery bad and use other libs
[11:16:30] <[algo]> I get your clue
[11:16:40] <ryanneufeld> hang on a sec here
[11:16:45] <ryanneufeld> that's not what I said
[11:16:55] <[algo]> I want best deferreds in jq
[11:17:01] <[algo]> I worked on deferreds actually long ago
[11:17:02] <ryanneufeld> my point is, if you don't like the way jquery does it, no one is holding a gun to your head
[11:17:03] <[algo]> ported to dojo
[11:17:08] <[algo]> do you know dojo library?
[11:17:12] <ryanneufeld> nope
[11:17:15] <[algo]> mochikit?
[11:17:19] <ryanneufeld> I know of it, but never used it
[11:18:16] <ryanneufeld> nope, never used it either
[11:18:26] <[algo]> actually, deferreds came to javascript from Twisted
[11:18:41] <[algo]> Twisted (python) -> Mochikit -> Dojo -> jQuery
[11:18:47] <[algo]> and JSDeferred between them
[11:18:55] <[algo]> but somehow jQuery got worst realization of all of them
[11:19:01] <[algo]> ;(
[11:19:04] <[algo]> makes me sad
[11:19:21] <ryanneufeld> so are you here for help, or just to complain about it? What am I missing here?
[11:19:30] <[algo]> jaubourg didn't like the idea I told you
[11:19:36] <[algo]> and decided to keep all as it is
[11:19:48] <[algo]> so actually I can't see a way to help here
[11:20:22] * ryanneufeld shrugs
[11:20:36] <[algo]> yeah, so I'm just expressing my opinion here
[11:20:41] <[algo]> for good ;)
[11:21:26] <ryanneufeld> the argument you're making here is no different in my opinion than complaining that JavaScript is not SomeOtherLanguage
[11:21:42] <ryanneufeld> jQuery is not SomeOtherLibrary so they may not do things the way you like
[11:21:47] <[algo]> actually you get me wrong
[11:21:47] <ryanneufeld> and that's okay
[11:21:52] <[algo]> the argument is "it's not convenient"
[11:22:13] <[algo]> the argument is: "the handler should itself decide how to behave: sync or async"
[11:22:42] <[algo]> "deferred handler should be free to either return or spawn async subcall"
[11:22:51] <[algo]> because that's how sync code bahves
[11:22:57] <[algo]> *behaves
[11:24:01] <[algo]> now in JQ, all handlers except pipe are limited to sync. I say: "let them be async to if they want"
[11:24:46] * [algo] gets the flag out of the pocket and draws: For the freedom to be async!
[11:26:44] <ryanneufeld> that asside
[11:26:54] <ryanneufeld> *aside
[11:27:13] <juha_> yo
[11:27:23] <ryanneufeld> it seems to me that the always should be, but is not, getting the data from both deferreds in your example
[11:28:05] <[algo]> ryanneufeld: fix the demo?
[11:28:12] <[algo]> I don't dare to say you're wrong
[11:28:13] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at it
[11:28:36] <ryanneufeld> well, I'm just getting up to speed with the concept right now
[11:28:41] <[algo]> hush
[11:28:43] <[algo]> always: function() {
[11:28:43] <[algo]>                     deferred.done.apply( deferred, arguments ).fail.apply( deferred, arguments );
[11:28:43] <[algo]>                     return this;
[11:28:43] <[algo]>                 },
[11:28:54] <ryanneufeld> hush?
[11:29:01] <[algo]> I mean, always is just done + fail
[11:29:07] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:29:11] <ryanneufeld> I can see that
[11:29:14] <ryanneufeld> I have the code open
[11:29:15] <[algo]> so no practical difference
[11:29:17] <[algo]> ok ok
[11:29:21] <ryanneufeld> just checked it out from git
[11:29:36] <[algo]> I'm very sorry to doubt you know
[11:29:36] <ryanneufeld> and that is what you would expect
[11:29:48] <[algo]> ;)
[11:29:54] <[algo]> trying to apply pipe here...
[11:30:01] <ryanneufeld> we're just talking here
[11:30:16] <ryanneufeld> might learn something along the way too
[11:30:20] <[algo]> sure
[11:30:25] * [algo] is learning
[11:33:58] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: I see what's going on here, it seems that with when
[11:34:00] <ryanneufeld> if one fails
[11:34:03] <ryanneufeld> the whole lot fail
[11:34:05] <[algo]> yeah solved it
[11:34:14] <ryanneufeld> show me?
[11:34:18] <[algo]> ryanneufeld: yes you are right
[11:34:21] <[algo]> about $.when
[11:34:31] <[algo]> but sometimes I need to know about both good and failed stuff
[11:34:38] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:34:44] <[algo]> a moment /posting
[11:34:45] <ryanneufeld> I see your point
[11:35:24] <[algo]> http://jsfiddle.net/xRWDc/3/
[11:35:31] <[algo]> sorry I used alert again
[11:36:19] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: I see
[11:36:34] * [algo] uses one more deferred to turn from the failed rails to good ones
[11:36:40] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:36:45] <ryanneufeld> that's what pipe is for
[11:36:51] <cybersholt> anybody got a sec to help with a jquery ui accordion / chrome problem? http://jsfiddle.net/fTREb/
[11:36:51] <[algo]> hahaha
[11:37:11] <[algo]> there are much more elegant ways to solve this
[11:37:16] <[algo]> pipe looks pretty bad here
[11:37:20] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: certainly
[11:37:22] <[algo]> especially with that null stuff
[11:37:39] <[algo]> with right handlers and w/o pipe it could do better
[11:37:43] <[algo]> but jaubourg is not here anyway
[11:37:54] <[algo]> thanks ryanneufeld
[11:38:12] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: I'm curious to see what you would suggest
[11:38:24] <[algo]> the really good way how deferreds should work
[11:38:25] <ryanneufeld> and do other libs offer the same chainability?
[11:38:29] <[algo]> yes
[11:38:31] <[algo]> jsdeferred
[11:38:37] <[algo]> greatest deferred I've ever seen
[11:38:44] <[algo]> made by Japanese guy
[11:38:49] <[algo]> very cool
[11:38:58] <[algo]> the right approach
[11:39:00] <[algo]> good syntax
[11:39:02] <[algo]> lots of extras
[11:39:05] <[algo]> jquery compartible
[11:39:14] <[algo]> I used them before jquery got native deferreds
[11:39:16] <ryanneufeld> careful with saying "the right approach"
[11:39:30] <ryanneufeld> that's a very general, and opinion based statement
[11:39:31] <[algo]> ryanneufeld: ok ok let's swap it another way
[11:39:40] <[algo]> "the approach which works much better in most situations in my experience"
[11:39:47] <ryanneufeld> like crockford says jslint is the best thing for your code :p
[11:39:53] <[algo]> "in my humble opinion"
[11:39:59] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:40:11] <[algo]> I don't add imho usually
[11:40:16] <[algo]> cause everything I say is imho
[11:40:46] <[algo]> so, in jsdeferreds
[11:41:10] <[algo]> umm there are pro and contra
[11:41:19] <[algo]> how they work is: any error inside deferred is caught
[11:41:21] <[algo]> and sent to fail
[11:41:25] <[algo]> any exception
[11:41:37] <cybersholt> anyone got a sec to help with a jquery ui accordion / chrome problem
[11:41:38] <[algo]> fail is kind of try..catch
[11:41:44] <[algo]> it gets the error
[11:41:53] <[algo]> in it may either throw something or return
[11:42:04] <[algo]> if it returns, then it's like "catch handled the error successfully"
[11:42:14] <[algo]> if it throws, then the flow goes to the next fail
[11:42:44] <[algo]> this way error handler can *handle* the error
[11:43:33] <[algo]> actually, the approach can be ported to jquery
[11:43:44] <[algo]> but without exceptions at all
[11:44:11] <ryanneufeld> cybersholt:seems to work fine on chrome for me
[11:45:14] <cybersholt> thanks ryann
[11:45:26] <cybersholt> it seems very laggy on mine idk why
[11:45:36] <cybersholt> just happened when i added the accordion
[11:46:22] <ryanneufeld> not sure man
[11:46:26] <ryanneufeld> but it's fine on mine
[11:47:14] <cybersholt> you on regular on dev channel ?
[11:47:21] <cybersholt> that may be the issue
[11:48:44] <ryanneufeld> 17
[11:48:51] <ryanneufeld> whatever that is
[11:49:23] <cybersholt> really appreciate it man thanks
[11:49:59] <ryanneufeld> np
[11:50:31] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: I think you might want to use $Callbacks instead of when for the problem you're trying to solve
[11:50:56] <ryanneufeld> wait, I take that back
[12:06:09] <Amel> Hello!
[12:07:01] <Amel> I've been trying to add jQuery to a Chrome extension, but it conflicts with another javascript library on the page it runs on
[12:07:10] <Amel> Is there any way I can work around this?
[12:07:47] <flyblackb> hello
[12:07:50] <Amel> My method was trying to add jQuery into the document, but that fails obviously since the document starts using jQuery
[12:08:09] <ryanneufeld> ?noconfict @ Amel
[12:08:10] <bot-t> Amel, jQuery.noConflict() - Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[12:08:28] <Amel> Yes I was trying that but I'm afraid I might be using it incorrectly
[12:08:36] <ryanneufeld> Amel: it's not hard
[12:08:54] <ryanneufeld> just call it before you do anything else
[12:09:04] <ryanneufeld> then you can use jQuery() instead of $
[12:09:23] <ryanneufeld> you can wrap your code in an iife and pass in jQuery
[12:09:45] <ryanneufeld> or you can detect if jquery is running, and an accpeptable version before you load it
[12:09:47] <ryanneufeld> that's an option too
[12:11:11] <Amel> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/j7MvE/
[12:11:41] <Amel> I'm using a work around because I need to load several jquery files, but maybe my way of doing it is bad
[12:11:53] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[12:11:57] <ryanneufeld> that's fucking terrible
[12:12:13] <ryanneufeld> why are you loading two versions of jquery?
[12:12:16] <Amel> Haha, appreciate the honesty
[12:12:26] <ryanneufeld> and an old version of jquery-ui?
[12:12:39] <Amel> Because I'm an idiot...
[12:12:46] <ryanneufeld> your words not mine
[12:13:09] <ryanneufeld> I would lean towards misguided before idiot
[12:13:13] <Amel> I'm still learning so I'm making mistakes
[12:13:21] <ryanneufeld> that's how you learn
[12:13:27] <ryanneufeld> also, if you're making an extension
[12:13:35] <ryanneufeld> just put the files you need in the package
[12:13:43] <ryanneufeld> no point in loading them from a CDN
[12:13:47] <Amel> I need to be able to use draggable()
[12:13:52] <ryanneufeld> the files are already on the users computer
[12:13:59] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:14:20] <Amel> It's not an extension, more of a script
[12:14:27] <Amel> script.user.js
[12:15:11] <Amel> So I should only load one script? Is there one that has draggable() and everything else?
[12:15:36] <ryanneufeld> is it an extension or a script?
[12:16:01] <Amel> It's a script that you install, much like a greasemonkey extension
[12:16:18] <[algo]> animation in jquery returns promise which passes no value?
[12:19:31] <[algo]> nevermind
[12:19:36] <[algo]> it provides element as value
[12:19:48] <Amel> ryanneufeld: I can't find any "one" script that does it
[12:20:04] <Amel> Even in the examples, multiple files are used
[12:20:15] <ryanneufeld> Amel: you can use more than one
[12:20:23] <ryanneufeld> but you don't need to load them from the web
[12:20:39] <Amel> But I'd rather not package those with it
[12:21:50] <ryanneufeld> so you'd rather force the user to download them from the web every time, even though it's the same versions every time, and they will have the script installed locally
[12:22:14] <ryanneufeld> you'd rather use two additional HTTP round trips where none are required?
[12:22:58] <Amel> But how can I package them with a user.js script?
[12:23:04] <Amel> This isn't a bundled extension or anything
[12:23:22] <ryanneufeld> so you're making a scriptlet?
[12:24:10] <Amel> I suppose?
[12:24:20] <ryanneufeld> how will it be used?
[12:24:56] <Amel> It loads on certain pages and adds some functionality with jQuery based on some if statements etc
[12:25:09] <ryanneufeld> how does it get loaded?
[12:25:47] <flyblackb> Does anyone know the best way to get a feature added to a jquery script if the developer no longer updates?
[12:25:48] <Amel> What are you asking?
[12:26:04] <ryanneufeld> how does your script get loaded on the page?
[12:26:30] <ryanneufeld> flyblackb: if it's open source just edit it
[12:26:57] <Amel> I don't understand the question. It loads because the script is allowed to load on that page
[12:27:09] <Amel> / @include        http://site.com/
[12:27:15] <ryanneufeld> what does that?
[12:27:34] <ryanneufeld> what is the mechanisim that injects the script on to the page?
[12:27:40] <ryanneufeld> it's not magic
[12:27:46] <Amel> Chrome does it
[12:27:53] <ryanneufeld> so it's a chrome extension
[12:28:13] <ryanneufeld> so, in your extension package, you put those files
[12:28:17] <Amel> It's a piece of javascript code run by the browser on certain pages, yes
[12:28:21] <ryanneufeld> and load them with the manifest.json
[12:28:50] <Amel> But it's not a package! You just click a javascript file and it installs!
[12:29:47] <ryanneufeld> is this a chrome extension?
[12:30:02] <ryanneufeld> you've said so twice now
[12:30:05] <ryanneufeld> that it is
[12:30:25] <ryanneufeld> if that's the cause, then you've been reading the chrome docs
[12:30:35] <ryanneufeld> and you would have a directory, with your stuff in it
[12:30:41] <ryanneufeld> that includes a manifest.json file
[12:30:48] <ryanneufeld> that tells chrome what files to load
[12:31:03] <Amel> No, I'm using the word "extension" very loosely
[12:31:07] <Amel> as I have been trying to tell you :P
[12:31:25] <ryanneufeld> okay, so what action causes your script to get loaded on the page?
[12:31:30] <flyblackb> ryanneufeld I am unable to edit the script because of technical limitations
[12:31:33] <Amel> I don't know the proper name for it, it's a javascript file that installs, nothing else
[12:31:34] <ryanneufeld> a user has to click on it ?
[12:31:42] <Amel> Yes
[12:31:51] <ryanneufeld> so a user would click on what?
[12:32:00] <ryanneufeld> a book mark link on their browser toolbar?
[12:32:40] <ryanneufeld> flyblackb: technical limitations?
[12:32:57] <Amel> No? The script is installed and saved in an extension folder, indistinguishable from real extensions.
[12:33:11] <flyblackb> lol yes
[12:33:12] <ryanneufeld> Amel: you're not making any sense
[12:33:14] <flyblackb> my skillset..
[12:33:17] <flyblackb> :x
[12:33:26] <Amel> Have you ever tried Chrome?
[12:33:37] <ryanneufeld> Amel: i've written chrome extensions
[12:33:45] <ryanneufeld> it's my primary browser
[12:34:12] <ryanneufeld> Amel: I wrote this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pkjomccnobbpfpbgdldlefchdnefcioj
[12:34:18] <ryanneufeld> It uses jquery
[12:34:35] <ryanneufeld> I included the jquery js file in the package
[12:34:36] <Amel> This is not an extension. I can write "alert('Hello world!');" into a document, save it as helloworld.user.js and load it into the browser, it will be installed
[12:34:49] <ryanneufeld> That's not installed
[12:34:52] <ryanneufeld> that's just loaded
[12:34:57] <Amel> No, it's installed
[12:35:07] <Amel> It will remain there and add an alert event to every page
[12:35:19] <ryanneufeld> how?
[12:35:24] <ryanneufeld> how does that happen?
[12:35:31] <ryanneufeld> what mechanism are you using for this?
[12:35:43] <Amel> Nothing! I could use tampermonkey but I'm not
[12:35:53] <Amel> Chrome does it straight out of the box!
[12:36:05] <ryanneufeld> Amel: how?
[12:36:17] <ryanneufeld> teach me how you are installing this script
[12:36:37] <Amel> I hope you're not just teasing me very well :P
[12:36:58] <Amel> <Amel> This is not an extension. I can write "alert('Hello world!');" into a document, save it as helloworld.user.js and load it into the browser, it will be installed
[12:37:43] <ryanneufeld> Amel: I don't understand how this script magically get's installed after you load it once
[12:37:50] <ryanneufeld> explain to me how you do this
[12:37:59] <Amel> Chrome asks if I want to install it
[12:38:18] <ryanneufeld> how does it know?
[12:38:27] <ryanneufeld> that it's installable?
[12:38:42] <Amel> The extension name is user.js
[12:39:15] <ryanneufeld> That wasn't so hard to answer now was it?
[12:39:36] <Amel> I honestly didn't understand your question dude
[12:39:36] <ryanneufeld> it seems that chrome has added support for greasemonkey scripts
[12:39:55] <Amel> Yes and has had support for it for a long time
[12:40:06] <ryanneufeld> you assumed I knew this
[12:40:12] <ryanneufeld> that's your fault
[12:40:13] <ryanneufeld> not mine
[12:40:18] <Amel> I tried explaining!
[12:40:36] <ryanneufeld> "you click it and it installs"
[12:40:42] <ryanneufeld> is basically what you said
[12:40:46] <Amel> Phrase your question better ;)
[12:40:55] <ryanneufeld> really?
[12:40:59] <Amel> Anyway, we've cleared that so let's put it behind us
[12:41:00] <ryanneufeld> really???
[12:41:27] <[algo]> when .done(...) returns result, this result is passed to next done ?
[12:41:30] <Amel> haha I'm sorry ryanneufeld :)
[12:41:39] <[algo]> .done(function() { return data }).done(function(res) { console.log(res) })
[12:41:42] <[algo]> will res be data?
[12:41:53] <ryanneufeld> tryit?
[12:42:14] <ryanneufeld> Amel: okay, so loading the JS via http is fine in this case
[12:42:36] <Amel> Agreed
[12:42:36] <ryanneufeld> Amel: since this is basically a scriptlet that just happens to run on every page.
[12:42:47] <ryanneufeld> Amel: now, you only need one version of jquery loaded
[12:42:58] <ryanneufeld> I'd go with 1.6.4 until 1.7.1 comes out
[12:43:19] <[algo]> it's not data
[12:43:21] <[algo]> but I wonder why
[12:43:40] <James13433> ryanneufeld, finally got it working :) thanks for your help
[12:44:06] <ryanneufeld> np
[12:44:27] <ryanneufeld> [algo]: cause it's calling functions from a stack
[12:44:49] <Amel> ryanneufeld: can you help me figure out a clean way of loading it?
[12:44:51] <[algo]> ryanneufeld: so if one done returns result, I can't get it in next done?
[12:44:56] <Amel> Also, does it include draggable()?
[12:44:57] <ryanneufeld> Amel: you're gonna wanna look up two things that will help you: 1) how to detect if jquery is loaded, and it's version
[12:45:15] <ryanneufeld> Amel: and then you're gonna wanna look up how you can use jquery-ui with noconflict
[12:46:27] <ryanneufeld> Amel: yes, the latest jquery ui has draggable, and it's not going away anytime soon
[12:46:35] <ryanneufeld> Amel: it's all in the docs man
[12:46:45] <ryanneufeld> jqueryui.com api.jquery.com @ Amel
[12:49:51] <Amel> Okay I think I've got it
[12:50:47] <ryanneufeld> FYI I don't think it's a well known thing that Chrome supports greasemonkey scripts. I would mention that in the future when you're asking for help :p
[12:51:02] <Amel> My bad, I thought it was
[12:51:22] <Amel> And I appreciate all your efforts, I think I'm on the right track now
[12:51:24] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I think browser specific extensions are more prolific
[12:51:32] <ryanneufeld> Good luck man

[13:05:06] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/wDeZF/ - how do I prevent the lower left product info from disappearing when the images rotate?
[13:32:00] <spleeze_123> Hello! I wish to slideDown() a div, but right before the anim starts, I want to open up a space as if the div was already opened, so when the slide anim occurs, the other page elements don't also slide down. They get immediately pushed out of the way, and then the div does the anim slide. There is no "height" attr on the sliding div. Any idea?
[13:37:46] <razzi> spleeze, see what outerHeight() or height() show when your div is still hidden
[13:38:11] <spleeze_123> razzi. Thanks I'll check it out.
[13:38:20] <razzi> just a guess though
[13:38:52] <spleeze_123> You are thinking create an outer DIV with that height (to create the space), and then let the sliding div do it's anim within that?
[13:39:24] <k_89> hi .. how do i catch the event of someone pressing enter while filling an input
[13:39:25] <k_89> ??
[13:39:34] <razzi> well if you can determine the final height, you can do some things yes..
[13:41:32] <spleeze_123> razzi> Yes it worked!  I get outerHeight() = 200px. Excellent! Thanks.
[13:50:49] <dogarrhea2> when you have specified soemthing to drag according to a grid, how do you make an event that detects when it snaps to the grid?

[14:25:12] <Eviltwin> the_cyber_guy: You can't use == or === with jQuery collections
[14:25:15] <Eviltwin> To see if they're the same
[14:25:39] <the_cyber_guy> ryanneufeld: but jsfiddle has no console to get the status or is there ?
[14:25:49] <the_cyber_guy> Eviltwin: then what should be used ?
[14:26:17] <Eviltwin> You should structure your code to work differently
[14:26:56] <qom2> I have a problem with this code here: http://pastebin.com/mN4NnQKy I want to be able to get a certain .loadingstatus that corresponds with the .pb I clicked, but I don't know how to "use" the $(this) that is triggered in the function that triggers the other function, if you understand what I mean..
[14:26:59] <the_cyber_guy> Eviltwin: something like index for those children will work ??
[14:30:47] <Eviltwin> the_cyber_guy: http://jsfiddle.net/WDtcf/
[14:31:13] <Eviltwin> .next() or .prev() will be empty if there is no next or previous
[14:32:54] <the_cyber_guy> Eviltwin: hmmmm, soooooooo minimal, thanks alot. i am learning more now :)
[14:33:13] <Eviltwin> Yeah, see how it gets at the heart of the issue?
[14:33:17] <Eviltwin> That's the goal :P
[14:34:31] <qom2> anyone understand my question?
[14:34:35] <qom2> don't really know what to google for
[14:35:20] <Eviltwin> qom2: Wasn't around for your question
[14:35:45] <qom2> yeah you were :p
[14:35:53] <jrockjiggz> i've seen this example at the end of a plugin there is ("hilite">jQuery);  does anyone know why it just isn't (jQuery)
[14:36:20] <Eviltwin> qom2: I was AFK and it's a while back in my logs
[14:36:32] <Eviltwin> qom2: So you could just ask it again or you could remain unhelped
[14:36:34] <qom2> you wrote a line just before I wrote the question!
[14:36:39] <Eviltwin> Either is fine with me
[14:37:04] <qom2> I don't wanna spam but, ok :(
[14:37:04] <qom2> I have a problem with this code here: http://pastebin.com/mN4NnQKy I want to be able to get a certain .loadingstatus that corresponds with the .pb I clicked, but I don't know how to "use" the $(this) that is triggered in the function that triggers the other function, if you understand what I mean..
[14:37:34] <Eviltwin> Okay, how is the HTML structured?
[14:37:47] <Eviltwin> Can you post a fragment in a pastebin as well?
[14:38:19] <qom2> ah, sorry: http://pastebin.com/E3tWQiRx
[14:38:42] <Eviltwin> They're clicking that a.pb?
[14:39:32] <qom2> yeah
[14:39:44] <qom2> and there are multiple..
[14:39:51] <Eviltwin> And you want to do stuff to that pb and the loadingstatus right after?
[14:40:26] <qom2> the a you click should get display: none and the .loadingstatus beside it should get display: block
[14:41:06] <Eviltwin> Okay, inside ajax_change_status, the pb you clicked is just "p" not "jQuery(this)"
[14:41:29] <Eviltwin> And the loadingstatus after it is "p.next('.loadingstatus')"
[14:42:03] <Eviltwin> I would do something like var ls = p.next(".loadingstatu")
[14:42:13] <Eviltwin> p.next(".loadingstatus")
[14:42:28] <Eviltwin> And then anywhere in the ajax_change_status
[14:42:39] <Eviltwin> Where you want to modify the pb, do pb.(whatever)
[14:42:52] <Eviltwin> And when you want to modify the loadingstatus, do ls.(whatever)
[14:43:09] <Eviltwin> Where (whatever) is your jQuery method
[14:43:59] <qom2>                 jQuery(".pb").click(function(){
[14:43:59] <qom2>                     ajax_change_status(p);
[14:44:00] <qom2> yeah?
[14:44:08] <qom2> cause that says that p is undefined
[14:44:13] <Eviltwin> No
[14:44:29] <Eviltwin> Only change inside ajax_function_load
[14:45:32] <qom2> ah right, thanks
[14:47:22] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/yfLe8/
[14:47:46] <Eviltwin> Gotta go, good luck
[14:48:24] <qom2> ah, real helpful, thanks alot!

[15:26:13] <lilmikey> hi
[15:26:55] <lilmikey> could some1 please explain to me, how e.preventDefault and returnvalue=false and the other ways to stop an event from happening work in different browsers?
[15:27:55] <lilmikey> basically, i want to use scrollTo and not execute the redirection from a link
[15:28:11] <lilmikey> (from an anchor element)
[15:28:22] <lilmikey> it works fine in chrome, but not mozilla or ie.
[15:29:10] <lilmikey> i was using:
[15:29:22] <lilmikey> if (event.preventDefault) { event.preventDefault(); } else { event.returnValue = false; };
[15:29:47] <lilmikey> in mozilla, it seems to stop the whole code that comes after it.
[15:40:38] <zkirill> Is there any way to add a fadeIn/fadeOut effect to jQuery UI show()

[15:41:16] <Spadeski1> fadeIn()  fadeOut()
[15:41:33] <Spadeski1> fadeIn() automatically sets the display to block
[15:42:08] <zkirill> Spadeski1: So I run fadeIn().show( "slide", { direction: "right" })
[15:46:03] <jrockjiggz> is $('.class')[0] valid?

[15:51:40] <ryanneufeld> ccmonster_: ask one more time
[15:52:01] <ryanneufeld> ccmonster_: if you don't see it in the docs, you'll probably have to do it yourself
[15:56:31] <ccmonster_> yea, dont see it in the docs, hence why i asked.
[15:56:51] <ccmonster_> and i dont see rotate90degrees anything
[15:57:39] <ryanneufeld> ccmonster_: I was being facetious
[15:57:47] <ryanneufeld> there is no way to do it out of the box
[15:57:53] <ryanneufeld> you're gonna have to write it yourself
[15:59:34] <ccmonster_> no problem
[15:59:43] <ccmonster_> just double checking in case I missed something

[16:22:31] <aleray> hi I have draggable + resizable jquery ui element. Is it possible to enable grid snapping only when shift key is down ?
[16:23:36] <Eviltwin> aleray: Bind keydown and keyup on window
[16:24:02] <Eviltwin> If the key is shift, set the grid option
[16:24:54] <aleray> so I need to set the grid option on all the instances ?
[16:25:21] <Eviltwin> Probably
[16:26:48] <Eviltwin> You could bind a new pair if listeners each time you instantiate
[16:28:48] <jrockjiggz> if can i add a selector to an existing select saved in a var
[16:29:16] <jrockjiggz> var e = $('input');  e.add('#other').click().. ?
[16:29:56] <Eviltwin> Is it not working for you?

[16:43:42] <John> Thank you so much Eviltwin :]
[16:43:45] <John> (and bot-t :P)
[16:44:33] <John> Hey - is there a way to easily create/delete elements with jquery?
[16:44:40] <John> like manage a bunch of divs
[16:44:52] <John> I've got this page - john.uk.com/optimusprimer2/GO.php
[16:45:20] <Eviltwin> ?.remove
[16:45:21] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:45:27] <Eviltwin> ?$()

[16:45:35] <Eviltwin> ?$
[16:45:36] <bot-t> bling
[16:45:41] <Eviltwin> Heh
[16:45:44] <Eviltwin> Okay
[16:45:45] <John> And those little yellow boxes, they need to move around so they're in the right order, and when one is deleted the others need to shuffle up to replace it, and when one's added the rest need to spread out so the new one can fit in
[16:45:50] <John> Is all this possible?
[16:46:17] <John> hahah, just saw that ?$ :P
[16:46:24] <Eviltwin> Make: $("<div/>") a new div
[16:47:15] <ryanneufeld> ?eval $

[16:48:47] <ryanneufeld> bot-t: are you broken?
[16:48:47] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, My reply is no.
[16:48:56] <ryanneufeld> bot-t: are you sure?
[16:48:56] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Better not tell you now.

[16:51:09] <primeras> please help
[16:55:40] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ primeras
[16:55:40] <bot-t> primeras, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[16:57:32] <primeras> ryanneufeld, demo site
[16:57:32] <primeras> http://adililhan.com/fs/examples/
[16:58:30] <ryanneufeld> primeras: of course it's gonna be an infinite loop
[16:58:36] <ryanneufeld> if you want it to auto refresh
[16:59:12] <primeras> please wait. google translate time. :)
[16:59:24] <ryanneufeld> primeras: try setTimeout(function(){ location.href = location.href; }, 1000);
[17:01:10] <primeras> ryanneufeld, hmm ok thanks. :) But, that code page refreshing.. I want to not refresh, just background reload
[17:01:20] <ryanneufeld> oh
[17:05:51] <ryanneufeld> hang on then
[17:07:03] <primeras> http://pastebin.com/gSrjuXnY
[17:07:05] <ryanneufeld> primeras: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/wFhuV/
[17:07:21] <primeras> i look
[17:08:24] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky HANGIN OUUT, DOOWN THE STREET, THE SAAME OOLD THIIING, WE DIID LAAAST WEEEK
[17:08:25] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[17:13:11] <primeras> ryanneufeld, that code working: http://pastebin.com/gSrjuXnY
[17:13:11] <ssteinerX> jquery-ui tabs -- tabs('select', tabNumber) causes page refresh and tab link to go from /#tabs-1 to http://fullurl/?next=&data-from&each-tab&in-a-get -- clicking on a tab just switches to the tab, and doesn't mess with links
[17:13:13] <primeras> http://adililhan.com/fs/examples/
[17:13:35] <primeras> but top party problem :(
[17:13:42] <ssteinerX> clues anyone?
[17:15:07] <ryanneufeld> primeras: you're replacing the contents of the div, with a copy of the page each time
[17:15:18] <ryanneufeld> so every time it loads, it's starting the timeout again
[17:16:49] <primeras> ryanneufeld, you wonder man thanks ;)
[17:17:59] <ryanneufeld> primeras: np, what language you speak?
[17:18:10] <primeras> Turkish
[17:19:03] <ryanneufeld> primeras: nice, good luck
[17:20:05] <primeras> :)
[17:20:38] <qom2> p.attr("class",data.change_to) – how do I write so that class becomes myclass + data.change_to?
[17:22:48] <ryanneufeld> ?addClass @ qom2
[17:22:48] <bot-t> qom2, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[17:23:27] <qom2> but I don't want to add I class, I need to switch class
[17:23:41] <ryanneufeld> ?removeClass @ qom2
[17:23:42] <bot-t> qom2, .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[17:23:51] <ryanneufeld> ?toggle @ qom2
[17:23:51] <bot-t> qom2, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[17:24:02] <ryanneufeld> that's not the one I meant
[17:24:06] <ryanneufeld> damn you bot-t
[17:24:07] <qom2> the div has the value .myclass.on or .myclass.off depending on post status
[17:24:25] <qom2> and I want to keep myclass, but switch between on/off (via data.change_to)
[17:24:32] <ryanneufeld> removeClass('on').addClass('off')
[17:24:40] <ryanneufeld> classes should be space separated
[17:24:52] <ryanneufeld> <div class="myclass on"></div>
[17:24:57] <ryanneufeld> <div class="myclass off"></div>
[17:26:07] <ryanneufeld> if you only have two states
[17:26:10] <ryanneufeld> make one the default
[17:26:19] <ryanneufeld> then you only need to add or remove one class
[17:26:25] <qom2> so it's not simply possible to use .attr and have a value and then + another value?
[17:26:30] <qom2> because that would be the simple solution for me
[17:26:37] <ryanneufeld> qom2: it's a bad solution
[17:26:39] <qom2> otherwise I have to rewrite a bunch of code
[17:26:46] <ryanneufeld> then rewrite it
[17:26:50] <ryanneufeld> and have a better solution
[17:27:26] <ryanneufeld> what does your markup look like?
[17:28:00] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/GnPcRt60
[17:28:04] <qom2> this is what I'm working with
[17:28:08] <qom2> it fetches the post status from a db
[17:29:02] <ryanneufeld> qom2: what's your markup look like?
[17:30:01] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/uMhRbL4b
[17:30:29] <ryanneufeld> what would class be after it was changed?
[17:30:47] <ryanneufeld> change_to="pending" class="pb publish"
[17:30:55] <qom2> should go from pb publish to pb pending
[17:30:58] <qom2> and vice versa
[17:31:12] <ryanneufeld> p.removeClass('publish').addClass('pending');
[17:31:24] <ryanneufeld> or
[17:31:26] <ryanneufeld> better yet
[17:31:33] <ryanneufeld> BTW the change_to
[17:31:35] <ryanneufeld> isn't valid
[17:31:43] <ryanneufeld> in some html doctypes
[17:31:45] <qom2> how so?
[17:31:55] <qom2> such as?
[17:32:06] <ryanneufeld> pretty much anything but html5
[17:32:16] <qom2> remove and add class isn't that dynamic if you look at my code
[17:32:25] <ryanneufeld> I have
[17:32:27] <qom2> since there's no if/else that handles
[17:32:32] <ryanneufeld> and it's not that great
[17:32:44] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to suggest how it could be better
[17:32:58] <ryanneufeld> What is the default state of the p?
[17:33:01] <ryanneufeld> pending?
[17:33:15] <qom2> no, there's no "default" state, since it's all grabbed from a db
[17:33:24] <qom2> so some are just pending and some are published
[17:33:31] <qom2> depending on how you left them
[17:33:31] <ryanneufeld> and if they aren't one or the other?
[17:33:46] <qom2> there's only pending/published available
[17:33:50] <qom2> no other cases
[17:33:53] <ryanneufeld> right, so if it's not published
[17:33:55] <ryanneufeld> it's pending
[17:33:59] <ryanneufeld> so
[17:34:00] <qom2> yup
[17:34:09] <qom2> (if there's no weird error that is)
[17:34:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:34:17] <ryanneufeld> gotcah
[17:34:28] <ryanneufeld> what's the data look like that comes back from your DB?
[17:34:44] <ryanneufeld> Assuming it's formatted by php/some other server side script
[17:35:04] <qom2> uhm it fetches the post id and then just check if it's published or pending
[17:35:06] <qom2> via a case check
[17:35:39] <ryanneufeld> so you could have json that looks like this: {postId:1243,published: true} ?
[17:36:06] <qom2> thing is, it work's – it might not be pretty (I haven't even coded it, because I'm very novice at this)
[17:36:34] <qom2> I don't know much about json, sorry :(
[17:36:44] <qom2> but that might be the case
[17:36:53] <ryanneufeld> have you seen what the data from your ajax end point looks like?
[17:37:34] <qom2> uhm, no
[17:37:51] <ryanneufeld> how do you know what's in data then?
[17:37:59] <qom2> http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/33442/custom-column-for-changing-post-status-via-ajax
[17:38:13] <qom2> this is what I've got, with some slight modifications (to the markup)
[17:38:14] * ryanneufeld looks
[17:39:28] <ryanneufeld> so you're echoing html from your ajax end point?
[17:40:05] <qom2> beyond my knowledge, hehe. I just know it works as it should
[17:40:43] <ryanneufeld> do you have somewhere I can see this in action?
[17:41:01] <ryanneufeld> if I could see it actually working I could suggest a solution for you
[17:43:49] <ryanneufeld> okay
[17:43:53] <ryanneufeld> I see what it's doing now
[17:43:59] <ryanneufeld> here's what you can do
[17:44:10] <ryanneufeld> gimme a sec, I'll update your pastbin
[17:47:43] <ssteinerX> can anyone tell me why tabs('select', tabNumber) rewrites all tab links whereas clicking on a tab does not?  Docs say that calling tabs('select', tabNumber) is supposed to "Select a tab, as if it were clicked."
[17:48:21] <ryanneufeld> qom2: http://pastebin.com/bHLQtuNp
[17:49:10] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ssteinerX
[17:49:11] <bot-t> ssteinerX, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[17:49:42] <qom2> oh sweet
[17:49:53] <qom2> splendid ryanneufeld :)
[17:49:55] <qom2> thanks alot
[17:50:25] <ryanneufeld> ideally though that markup isn't the greatest, but that's a battle for another day I think
[17:51:04] <qom2> hehe, I'm just happy with the help I get on different forums, trying to get this CMS to work as I like
[17:51:17] <qom2> quite heavily modified version of wordpress, but I guess you understood that
[17:53:14] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:53:17] <ryanneufeld> I can see that
[17:53:25] <qom2> :)
[17:53:31] <qom2> thanks again, now I'm off to bed
[17:53:58] <rabbit123> Hi. I am looking for some way to move divs around, is there any JQuery function that does a similar job?
[17:55:04] <ryanneufeld> yes
[17:55:09] <ryanneufeld> there are
[17:55:35] <ryanneufeld> however with such a vague question, it's hard to provide a less than vague answer
[17:56:22] <rabbit123> What I had in mind was moving divs by drag and drop
[17:56:31] <rabbit123> And the other divs rearranging themselves
[17:56:54] <rabbit123> More or less like the Chrome app tab, where you can move the apps around
[17:57:03] <ryanneufeld> see
[17:57:10] <ryanneufeld> now that I can tell you EXACTLY what to use :)
[17:57:16] <rabbit123> :)
[17:57:23] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[17:57:53] <rabbit123> Ah that looks awesome, thanks :)
[17:58:03] <ryanneufeld> it is awesome
[17:58:49] <KAL_> Is there a way to scroll up when an iframe is clicked?
[17:58:58] <ryanneufeld> KAL_: yes
[17:59:38] <KAL_> Could you tell me how?
[18:00:12] <ryanneufeld> oh, probablly, lemme think for a sec
[18:00:30] <ryanneufeld> you need to bind the click from inside the iframe
[18:00:47] <ryanneufeld> then call window.top.scrollTop or something like that
[18:01:22] <KAL_> How would I bind the click?
[18:01:38] <ryanneufeld> is it your content in the iframe?
[18:01:43] <KAL_> Yes.
[18:01:52] <ryanneufeld> do you load jquery in the iframe?
[18:02:06] <KAL_> No. Only in the parent document.
[18:02:13] <jedimind> did you ask the iframe to play nice ?
[18:02:20] <jedimind> <iframe playnice="please">
[18:02:31] <ryanneufeld> ignore jedimind
[18:02:32] <zulax> i downloaded jquery-ui from github, so there is no jquery-ui.version.js file?
[18:02:47] <ryanneufeld> zulax: get it from the website
[18:02:59] <zulax> ok
[18:03:08] <ryanneufeld> zulax: jqueryui.com, you can get an assembled version
[18:03:11] <KAL_> jedimind: I tried pressing my DWIM button.
[18:03:23] <ryanneufeld> KAL_: you need to load jquery in the ifram
[18:03:33] <ryanneufeld> and bind a click event to something
[18:03:46] <jedimind> dwim buttons should be on every site ever
[18:04:09] <ryanneufeld> I just shout at my screen "DWIMNWIT"
[18:04:22] <jedimind> haha
[18:04:24] <ryanneufeld> NWIT == Not What I Typed
[18:04:53] <KAL_> Okay. That probably won't work as well. I'm loading a photo gallery created in iWeb and iWeb doesn't like any extra code. Do you know of a better way to host a photo gallery?
[18:05:08] <ryanneufeld> anything but iphoto
[18:05:29] <ryanneufeld> http://gallery.menalto.com/
[18:05:48] <ryanneufeld> probably the quickest if you just wanna get photos online
[18:06:26] <KAL_> Alright. I'll try that. Thanks.
[18:06:33] <ryanneufeld> np
[18:13:56] <KAL_> ryanneufeld: I am uploading it now. It takes awhile.
[18:14:09] <ryanneufeld> good job
[18:14:50] <DobreJoe> Is there a way to duplicate the slide to the left or to the right of jQuery UI with jQuery show() alone?
[18:15:21] <ryanneufeld> DobreJoe: you mean a slide left or slide right?
[18:15:26] <DobreJoe> yes
[18:15:26] <ryanneufeld> ?animate @ DobreJoe
[18:15:27] <bot-t> DobreJoe, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[18:15:38] <DobreJoe> thanks!
[18:15:40] <ryanneufeld> np
[18:16:02] <ryanneufeld> I swear 90% of what I type in here is nothing more than a polite "RFTM"
[18:17:23] <zulax> never seen this $( init );
[18:17:27] <zulax> what is it?
[18:18:04] <zulax> like init in c?
[18:18:21] <ryanneufeld> zulax: no
[18:18:28] <ryanneufeld> where did you see it ?
[18:18:34] <zulax> in a guys image
[18:18:48] <ryanneufeld> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[18:18:50] <zulax> then he has function init function init() { }
[18:19:18] <ryanneufeld> Read that ^^
[18:19:27] <ryanneufeld> and all will be clear
[18:19:28] <ryanneufeld> if not
[18:19:32] <ryanneufeld> then ask
[18:19:37] <ryanneufeld> but read first
[18:19:58] <snover> ryanneufeld: DOUBLE RAINBOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN
[18:20:02] <Anime> i need to do an .fadeout/in + .animate at the same time (queue: false iirc), but i also need to call a callback function after the whole animation ends, but it seems that with queue false the callback function is also called at the same time with the rest of the animation. is this right? how can i do both animations at the same time and only after finishing execute the callback function?
[18:20:27] <ryanneufeld> snover: THAT MAGIC UNICORNS WILL COME SOON!!!
[18:20:45] <ryanneufeld> Anime: look at deferreds
[18:21:03] <Anime> right
[18:21:07] <zulax> ryanneufeld,  is it like document.onready?
[18:21:09] <ryanneufeld> Anime: http://danheberden.com/presentations/jqsummit-deferreds-in-jquery
[18:21:16] <ryanneufeld> zulax: yes
[18:21:24] <zulax> hmm...
[18:21:36] <zulax> cool thanks
[18:21:38] <ryanneufeld> All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent:
[18:21:38] <ryanneufeld> $(document).ready(handler)
[18:21:38] <ryanneufeld> $().ready(handler) (this is not recommended)
[18:21:39] <ryanneufeld> $(handler)
[18:21:53] <ryanneufeld> copy and pasted from the docs BTW
[18:22:18] <zulax> so that means every handler i make i need to add a init for it?
[18:22:26] <ryanneufeld> no
[18:23:01] <ryanneufeld> $(functionNameHere) is the same thing as $(document).ready(functionNameHere);
[18:23:12] <zulax> ok
[18:23:21] <ryanneufeld> $(function(){}); === $(document).ready(function(){});
[18:23:49] <ryanneufeld> basically adds that function to a list of functions to get called when the DOM is ready
[18:23:59] <ryanneufeld> so this this persons case
[18:24:06] <ryanneufeld> they created the init function
[18:24:15] <ryanneufeld> and instructed jquery to execute it on domready
[18:24:38] <zulax> basically, every function i create, i should make $(myfun) according to this method
[18:24:45] <ryanneufeld> no
[18:24:51] <zulax> instead, i could have everything on bodyload method and not worry about it
[18:25:02] <ryanneufeld> no
[18:25:10] <zulax> :( confuzed
[18:25:11] <ryanneufeld> I don't think you're getting it
[18:25:23] <zulax> konfuzed
[18:25:41] <ryanneufeld> the point of the document ready is that you can delay execution of your code until the HTML/CSS is ready
[18:25:54] <zulax> ok
[18:26:05] <ryanneufeld> if you are just writing functions to use
[18:26:09] <ryanneufeld> you don't need to use ready
[18:26:15] <zulax> gotcha
[18:26:21] <ryanneufeld> unless you want them to be run as soon as the page is finished loading
[18:26:29] <zulax> ah!
[18:26:40] <zulax> then thats like the C init then
[18:26:49] <ryanneufeld> this is not C
[18:26:55] <zulax> right, but just the concept
[18:26:55] <ryanneufeld> don't try and make it like C
[18:26:57] <ryanneufeld> no
[18:26:59] <zulax> like main()
[18:27:02] <ryanneufeld> no
[18:27:12] <ryanneufeld> it's not like main
[18:27:32] <ryanneufeld> main is the function that the OS looks for when executing your code
[18:27:34] <zulax> hehe, hopefully i will get the hang of it by playing more
[18:27:50] <ryanneufeld> javascript is just executed from the top of the file
[18:27:57] <ryanneufeld> in the order the files are loaded
[18:28:13] <snover> ?101 @ zulax
[18:28:13] <bot-t> zulax, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[18:28:14] <zulax> right
[18:28:19] <ryanneufeld> snover: ths
[18:28:26] <zulax> heeh
[18:28:27] <zulax> ok
[18:28:45] <ryanneufeld> that's actually a fantastic bit of material
[18:28:53] <ryanneufeld> which I forgot about
[18:29:59] <zulax> ok, now i am clear
[18:30:14] <zulax> so $( init ); just calls the function init()
[18:30:34] <ryanneufeld> yes
[18:30:35] <zulax> cause something needs to call the functino for it to functino
[18:30:45] <ryanneufeld> once the DOM is ready
[18:31:09] <zulax> gosh, he confused me with the init word! its been a coupel of months since i did jquery so i thought is there  a new thing now
[18:31:19] <ryanneufeld> lol
[18:33:06] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's arbitrary
[18:33:27] <ryanneufeld> but their choice in name does indicate it's intent
[18:33:35] <zulax> yes
[18:33:39] <ryanneufeld> that could be calling the init for a plugin
[18:33:53] <ryanneufeld> you could have $(myFancyInit) too
[18:34:06] <ryanneufeld> as long as myFancyInit was a function
[18:34:11] <zulax> yup
[18:34:21] <ryanneufeld> got it now
[18:34:23] <ryanneufeld> ?
[18:34:27] <zulax> yes sir
[18:34:30] <zulax> thanks :)
[18:34:32] <ryanneufeld> np
[18:40:36] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: thanks so much, that 'default to submit button' thing had me baffled and you saw it right away
[18:40:47] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: what can I do to thank you?
[18:41:01] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: (other than thank you, which I just did)
[18:41:11] <ryanneufeld> oh, I dunno
[18:41:30] <ryanneufeld> I should start an amazon wishlist :p
[18:41:41] <ryanneufeld> I don't really expect anything dude
[18:41:48] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: you really should -- I'd buy you a book right now
[18:41:51] <zulax> ssteinerX, you could send him some $$ if his help helped you make some $$$ ;)
[18:41:52] <jrockjiggz> he wants fries
[18:41:56] <jrockjiggz> 'give me food
[18:42:15] <ssteinerX> zulax: If he tells me how, I will
[18:42:29] <zulax> ryanneufeld, let his express his thankful ness
[18:42:36] <zulax> him
[18:42:42] <ryanneufeld> haha
[18:42:47] <ryanneufeld> sure, why not
[18:43:00] <ryanneufeld> ssteinerX: I just pm'd you my paypal ;)
[18:43:08] <zulax> i recently had my boss get me a new book
[18:43:40] <zulax> c# mvc3 (although by the time the book got to me, i had most of the content read on the web)
[18:43:47] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:43:53] <ryanneufeld> I don't typically buy paper books anymore
[18:44:02] <ryanneufeld> I have an android phone and an ipad
[18:44:09] <ryanneufeld> so I just read on one of those
[18:44:23] <zulax> cool
[18:45:09] <zulax> so to make a quiz, is this possible
[18:45:21] <zulax> cause we have the same thing, 1 question and 4 options over and over
[18:45:43] <zulax> could i make a class like in javascript and just make objects out of it
[18:45:58] <ryanneufeld> zulax: yeah
[18:46:01] <ryanneufeld> you can do that
[18:46:14] <ryanneufeld> you might want to check out the jquery ui widget factory
[18:46:21] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: done
[18:46:23] <zulax> ok
[18:46:49] <ryanneufeld> thanks ssteinerX
[18:47:36] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: np, you saved me another hour of staring, it's well worth it and I wanted to show my appreciation
[18:47:52] <ryanneufeld> no complaints here :p
[18:48:38] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: spend it well -- like, stick it in your retirement plan and remember when it's worth a zillion dollars and I'm begging at your door for food ;-)
[18:48:56] <ryanneufeld> psh
[18:49:03] <ryanneufeld> I look down on you puny 995s
[18:49:04] <ryanneufeld> lol
[18:49:16] <ryanneufeld> 99%s FML I can't type
[18:49:29] <ryanneufeld> too much typing today
[18:49:40] <ryanneufeld> Carpal Tunnel catching up
[18:50:00] <ryanneufeld> ssteinerX: that just covered the pizza I just ordered :P
[18:50:39] <zulax> is using widget factory the only way of doing it
[18:50:44] <ssteinerX> go outside and do 50 pushups, then run around the house 5 times, shake your arms and wrists around -- *then* you can have your pizza (you're welcome!)
[18:50:45] <ryanneufeld> zulax: nope
[18:50:57] <ryanneufeld> ssteinerX: what are you a personal trainer?
[18:51:06] <ryanneufeld> I'm fat, white, north american
[18:51:10] <ryanneufeld> I don't do any of those things lol
[18:51:13] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: am now ;-)
[18:51:21] <ryanneufeld> touche
[18:51:42] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: I don't think you're using that right -- you hadn't made a point ;-)
[18:52:50] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: (see Apple ads, circa three years ago)
[18:53:26] <ryanneufeld> used as an acknowledgment during a discussion of a good or clever point made at one's expense by another person.
[18:53:51] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: thanks for clearing that up
[18:53:57] <ryanneufeld> hehe
[18:54:09] <ryanneufeld> didn't even have to reach for my mouse :p
[18:54:23] <ssteinerX> ryanneufeld: as my three year old used to say "You crack me open"
[18:54:34] <ryanneufeld> awwww
[18:54:37] <ryanneufeld> that's adorable
[18:54:59] <ssteinerX> yah
[18:55:13] <ssteinerX> kids, you gotta' love 'em 'cause you can't eat'em
[18:55:31] <ryanneufeld> I love kids, but I could never eat a whole one
[18:55:48] <ssteinerX> that's why God invented knives
[18:56:03] <ryanneufeld> Man invented knives
[18:56:33] <ssteinerX> Oh yah, that's right, God invented children ;-)
[18:56:59] * ryanneufeld keeps his anti-religous rant to himself
[18:57:15] * ssteinerX also keeps...
[19:19:55] <Anime> hey ryan?
[19:24:24] <CaffeinatedSky> Anti-Religious Rant? Rofl. Don't stuff it down other people's throat then :P
[20:08:26] <zulax> in my own js file, how can i use jquery syntax
[20:08:42] <zulax> although in my html file, i load the jquery file first then then my own js script
[20:18:07] <c_t_montgomery> zulax: not sure i understand your question. if you're loading in jQuery before your other js file, as long as jquery loaded (which, if you're relying on a CDN it may not have - i'd make sure that it has loaded), you're able to use the functions associated with it, sizzle, etc… (all the jQuery goodness).
[20:19:38] <zulax> looks like its my cache problem on browser
[20:19:43] <zulax> its working ow
[20:19:44] <zulax> now
[20:19:45] <c_t_montgomery> :D
[21:38:02] <jacky123> heya. i have 2 textbox, 1 for html code and another for css code. now as user puts in html and css code, i wanna show live preview in realtime. is there some jquery plugin to do that ?
[22:49:03] <hightekvagabond> ok, I have a .draggable() object inside a div that has overflow: auto….. I want to drag it out of the div rather than have the div scroll when I drag… is there a trick to that?
[23:31:00] <GoSox> i can get the height of a div simply by using .height() , is there a way I can get the height of that div, including any padding, margin and border it might have?
[23:34:32] <GoSox> outerHeight(true) yay
