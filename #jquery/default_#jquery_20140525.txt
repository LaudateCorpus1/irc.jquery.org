[01:40:20] <Dysharmonic> Would the best way to relate two groups of elements/arrays with one another be through mapping?

[05:40:37] <Guest34026> Hi, I'm trying to splite my library into seperate AMD modules and concatenate them all for the release vertion, just like what jQuery is doing on it's github repo https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src
[05:41:10] <Guest34026> how do they remove require/define statements form their code
[05:41:55] <Guest34026> when I optimize my code using r.js I still see require/define statements
[05:42:04] <Guest34026> can any body help me with that?
[05:51:04] <bumbar> will $(document).on('blur', element, function() {} ); bind to elements loaded will ajax?
[06:07:17] <michelleglauser> Could someone please help me figure out how to return the final list of sorted images to the page (not just the console) after sorting is completed on this JSFiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/MichelleGlauser/EF427/3/ Right now, the line "$('.results').replaceWith('You like:', yesList);" is occurring too early so the last image never gets sorted, and the images are not being shown.
[06:50:31] <legrandin> hi guys!
[06:54:14] <sirhackal> hello
[06:54:18] <sirhackal> can i get a site check
[06:55:28] <legrandin> whats a site check
[06:55:46] <sirhackal> check my site for issues and opinions
[06:55:57] <sirhackal> http://www.helloearth.us
[06:56:12] <legrandin> whats it built off of?
[06:56:32] <sirhackal> jquery and html5/flash
[06:56:59] <legrandin> wait these are feeds of sattellites?
[06:57:16] <sirhackal> its a live hd feed of the space station
[06:58:29] <legrandin> where did you get the data that allows you to map where the sattelite is
[06:58:48] <sirhackal> nasa
[06:59:06] <sirhackal> does it load fine ? whats your browser/os
[06:59:59] <legrandin> yep loads fine. chrome / ubuntu
[07:00:31] <sirhackal> is it running flash player or html5 for the video
[07:00:42] <legrandin> how do i check that
[07:00:50] <legrandin> oh, its flash
[07:00:50] <sirhackal> right click on the video
[07:00:59] <sirhackal> ok
[07:01:29] <sirhackal> also if you click on videos on top left .. let a video load..then click on the camera links on top right..does it let you switch back to normal
[07:01:35] <sirhackal> thats where the jquery is acting up i think
[07:01:35] <legrandin> onesmall thing. when you're registering, the down arrow jumps by like 15 years so i missed my birth year a few times
[07:01:49] <legrandin> i mean the down arrow on the year selector
[07:02:10] <sirhackal> oh i didnt do that part
[07:02:14] <legrandin> oh ok
[07:02:17] <legrandin> whered you get it from?
[07:02:23] <sirhackal> thats ustream
[07:02:30] <legrandin> ahh i see
[07:03:33] <legrandin> the video streams for this thing always seem a bit finnicky
[07:03:42] <legrandin> even not on your site
[07:04:07] <sirhackal> the feed may be off..depends where the station is at
[07:04:57] <sirhackal> yeah station is in the back side of earth so no feed to show
[07:05:21] <sirhackal> but the idea is you click on videos and watch shit until it comes back around
[07:05:57] <legrandin> i like the idea
[07:06:07] <legrandin> i mean it simplifies and improves on the feeds from nasa themselfves
[07:06:17] <legrandin> and the map thing really helps if you are wondering why you cant see shit
[07:06:57] <legrandin> looks like it could have some potential
[07:07:22] <sirhackal> thanks. im doing it to learn jquery actually
[07:07:34] <legrandin> hah im doing the same
[07:07:50] <sirhackal> actually it was going to be in angular but jquery creeped in there
[07:08:04] <legrandin> im coming from python, so jquery made pretty much no sense to me at first
[07:08:39] <sirhackal> im coming from actionscript so its somewhat understandable
[07:08:47] <legrandin> whats acrionscript?
[07:09:01] <sirhackal> its javascript for flash
[07:09:05] <legrandin> oh
[07:09:53] <legrandin> yeah i spend like 8 hours trying to get an ajax call to run its success callback
[07:10:48] <sirhackal> have you looked at angularjs?
[07:10:53] <legrandin> i have
[07:11:15] <legrandin> im gonna do that next for sure, after i get some healthy javascript study
[07:11:28] <legrandin> did jquery with pretty much no javascript knowledge
[07:11:37] <sirhackal> are you working professionally in python?
[07:11:39] <legrandin> although jquery feels really different
[07:11:51] <legrandin> not yet. im self taught, gonna try to get a django job soon
[07:12:38] <sirhackal> i dont know if should focus on python or ruby
[07:12:58] <Crease> can somene tell me how to display Wrong answer only one time? http://jsfiddle.net/7eqmv/
[07:13:05] <legrandin> well i would pick python personally. there are tons ofthings going on with python
[07:13:32] <legrandin> django is already excellent, it has asyncio with twisted, its mbeing used more and more in science and education
[07:13:47] <legrandin> so a python programmer probably has more options than a ruby programmer, i would think
[07:14:51] <sirhackal> but ruby could charge more
[07:15:27] <legrandin> well for me i dont care too much about salary.
[07:16:24] <legrandin> crease, why dont you just remove the append after you display it
[07:16:38] <legrandin> or wait...
[07:17:10] <legrandin> yeah, have a first call which removes the div an a second call which adds the div
[07:17:42] <Crease> im confused
[07:18:35] <Crease> how to remove first wrong answer after I press another wrong answer
[07:18:55] <legrandin> hold on
[07:20:00] <legrandin> ok
[07:20:18] <legrandin> how about having the wrong thing there all thetime, and hiding itwhen its correct and displaying it when its wrong?
[07:21:52] <legrandin> sorry im kind ofn ew :D
[07:22:14] <Crease> ok I will try it
[07:23:25] <beancurd> ruby can charge more?
[07:24:26] <legrandin> here you go crease
[07:24:26] <legrandin> http://jsfiddle.net/7eqmv/3/
[07:25:02] <Crease> Thanl you legrandin
[07:25:09] <legrandin> http://jsfiddle.net/7eqmv/4/ this one is better actually
[07:25:23] <beancurd> i could be wrong, but i'm under the impression that ruby is propped up by rails.
[07:25:36] <legrandin> that ws my opiniontoo :O
[07:26:14] <beancurd> whereas python, without django, or even any other webframework, still has a solid ecosystem.
[07:26:20] <legrandin> i dunno, my languages are gonna be python, javascript, and C
[07:26:40] <legrandin> i figure that gives me a pretty well rounded resume
[07:27:20] <beancurd> needs more haskell
[07:27:34] <beancurd> or functional language
[07:27:39] <legrandin> yeah i know
[07:27:53] <legrandin> in the long term  i will, but ive only got time for those 3 right now
[07:28:14] <beancurd> time?
[07:28:53] <legrandin> yeah. its hard to do all that at once. i can really only dedicate myself to one thing at a time
[07:29:04] <legrandin> right now its django / jquery / angular
[07:29:25] <legrandin> not employed as a programmer
[07:30:05] <beancurd> i'm guessing you're good with html / css already.
[07:30:34] <beancurd> what's your profession now?
[07:31:38] <legrandin> i work for an seo company :D
[07:31:49] <beancurd> doing?
[07:32:13] <legrandin> designing! althought designing off another designer's work
[07:32:25] <legrandin> i started out writing content then taught myself CSS and then started doing design
[07:32:34] <beancurd> right.
[07:32:39] <beancurd> seo is interesting.
[07:32:59] <legrandin> i suppose so
[07:33:31] <beancurd>  how much of it is keywords, and how much of it is backlinks?
[07:33:34] <legrandin> its way down on the internet businesses scale though
[07:33:35] <beancurd> 50/50?
[07:33:46] <legrandin> backlinks are cshit actually, so are keywords
[07:34:03] <beancurd> so they're both shit?
[07:34:07] <legrandin> the important thing now is to have facebook, blog, google places set up
[07:34:18] <legrandin> and to have the blog and facebook and twitter updated frequently
[07:34:18] <beancurd> so it's all social now?
[07:34:23] <legrandin> more or less
[07:34:32] <beancurd> interesting...
[07:34:37] <legrandin> keywords and backlinks are now poison
[07:34:50] <legrandin> we stopped usingkeyword tags like 6 months ago
[07:35:07] <beancurd> you mean meta keywords?
[07:35:08] <legrandin> also there are a lot of cites out there for business citations
[07:35:19] <legrandin> yes meta keywords, we still use keywords in the body and title and headings and such
[07:35:28] <legrandin> sites*
[07:35:44] <beancurd> oh. i know about meta keyword tags, they haven't been used for years.
[07:35:53] <fschuindt> Fest tip here guys: localStorage[room_id] = {"partner_public_key": response}; How can I access the partner_public_key after that? I have tried localStorage[room_id]['partner_public_key']; with no success. :( Any help?
[07:35:57] <fschuindt> Fest*
[07:36:01] <fschuindt> Fast**
[07:36:04] <legrandin> also we only ever get clients that already have domains :D cause we cant do shit unless they have their own domain
[07:36:53] <beancurd> i figure there's probably a marketfor seo places to build a company from the groud up?
[07:37:44] <legrandin> there probably is but they cant really charge much because it can take a long ass time to get your site up in the searches
[07:38:04] <legrandin> we charge sort of a middle-of-the-road rate
[07:38:14] <beancurd> what's considered middle of the road?
[07:38:18] <beancurd> per / mo
[07:38:22] <legrandin> for us, 600$ a month
[07:38:25] <legrandin> 700
[07:38:39] <beancurd> hmm..
[07:38:44] <beancurd> usd?
[07:38:45] <legrandin> that may actually be pretty low, im n ot sure
[07:38:49] <legrandin> yes
[07:39:14] <legrandin> no matter what though the clients never want to pay
[07:39:25] <legrandin> even though PPC will charge then out the ass
[07:39:33] <beancurd> 700 is rather deep.
[07:39:50] <beancurd> at that rate they're probably thinking they'd rather just throw money at google ads.
[07:40:02] <legrandin> well they would end up paying more, for sure
[07:40:04] <beancurd> for B2B at least.
[07:40:11] <beancurd> b2c is different.
[07:40:26] <legrandin> not sure what that is?
[07:40:30] <beancurd> really depends on what the money buys them.
[07:40:41] <beancurd> b2b = business to business, b2c business to consumer.
[07:41:24] <legrandin> hm
[07:41:31] <legrandin> well it depends on the area
[07:41:43] <legrandin> if you are trying to optimize for auto repair in Dallas you're screwed
[07:41:50] <beancurd> heh.
[07:42:03] <legrandin> but for  t he same category in minnesota you're going to get lots of calls
[07:42:18] <beancurd> different for b2b.
[07:42:31] <beancurd> buy ad for dallas auto fleet maintenance.
[07:42:32] <beancurd> done.
[07:42:43] <legrandin> mayhaps
[07:43:08] <beancurd> yeah, nfi really.
[07:43:22] <beancurd> not my area of expertise, but it's quite interesting.
[07:43:26] <legrandin> interesting.
[07:43:37] <legrandin> well i gotta split. nice talking with you,.
[07:44:59] <beancurd> cya
[08:01:01] <Absolute0> I generated a json object with jquery in chrome inspector; that gave me a truncated object such as [>Object, >Object, ...]. I'd like to copy an paste that into a real json plaintext, how can i do that?
[08:01:32] <Absolute0> I tried JSON.stringify but that gave a circular reference error
[08:03:18] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: JSON.stringify([{"foo":"bar"}]) would work.
[08:03:46] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: Can you show up the object?
[08:03:51] <BillCriswell> In a fiddle or something.
[08:06:40] <Absolute0> It's the output of $.map
[08:11:06] <tandroid> Is there a simple way to check if an index in an array exists?
[08:12:43] <tandroid> Actually, let me make an example because it's not as straight forward as something like if ( i < someArray.length) {}
[08:18:15] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: Do you have functions or anything like that in the object?
[08:24:48] <Absolute0> "/wc
[08:40:49] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery validation and manually added a remote-validation and custom message for the remote validation. but input-field also has the class "number" and if i have a letter in it, i only get the custom message instead of the normal one. how is it done properly?
[08:53:02] <odisa> BillCriswell: Hi, are you there? My internet failed yesterday.. Your advice helped, but now I'm stuck with a new problem related to it.
[08:53:16] <BillCriswell> I am here.
[08:53:44] <odisa> Great! So I managed to get it to fadeOut and In, but now if it fadesOut, the music stops playing
[08:54:27] <odisa> and just reloads the YouTube playlist upon fading in
[08:55:04] <odisa> does fading somehow hide/remove the element (recursively)?
[08:57:40] <Azrael_-> anybody mind to have a look regarding my problem?
[09:00:21] <BillCriswell> odisa: Can you set up a demo?
[09:00:36] <odisa> BillCriswell: it's live at http://odisa.tk
[09:00:46] <odisa> but I can try to get a jsfiddle if that's preferable
[09:02:04] <BillCriswell> odisa: I can't replicate that. It works as expected here in Chrome. Is it not working propertly in a particular browser?
[09:02:58] <odisa> BillCriswell: No, FireFox stops it from playing upon scrolling. I'll try it in Chrome, and set up a jsfiddle
[09:03:10] <BillCriswell> The fiddle isn't needed.
[09:03:52] <BillCriswell> Oh man, this looks way different in firefox.
[09:08:53] <BillCriswell> odisa: It seems a display none on the div you're fading stops the player from playing.
[09:09:50] <odisa> BillCriswell: I'll check that out, thanks.. Indeed, works fine on Chrome. Doesn't look that different though.
[09:09:53] <BillCriswell> odisa: in Firefox
[09:10:05] <BillCriswell> I see columns in firefox.
[09:10:12] <anshuman> hi all. I am new to jquery. Was trying it on eclipse kepler but the autocomplete was not working... checked the same on the net but the plugin suggested (i.e. JSDT) did not work.
[09:10:23] <BillCriswell> oskark: You could get around it with opacity: 0 instead of display: none.
[09:11:08] <odisa> BillCriswell: right, I don't have the display: none anymore.. I'm using fadeIn and fadeOut as per here : http://jsfiddle.net/47pAP/
[09:11:14] <odisa> unless I'm missing something
[09:11:38] <BillCriswell> odisa: The fadeOut does display: none at the end.
[09:11:45] <odisa> aha !
[09:12:23] <odisa> so instead of .fadeOut(), I should try .css('opacity', '0')?
[09:12:26] <shoky> .fadeTo to the rescue
[09:12:50] <shoky> .fadeTo(0)
[09:13:07] <odisa> shoky: replacing fadeOut? I'll try that, thanks
[09:13:09] <BillCriswell> shoky: I totally forgot about that.
[09:13:44] <BillCriswell> shoky: It's interesting that FireFox will stop it playing on display: none; but opacity: 0; is cool.
[09:14:01] <shoky> oh it's only on firefox?
[09:14:23] <odisa> yeah Chrome works fine.
[09:15:36] <shoky> i don't see any vid, but i use that click-to-play option
[09:16:21] <shoky> oh it's on that side thingy
[09:16:30] <odisa> yeah
[09:16:48] <odisa> well my other opton would be to unchild the vid I suppose
[09:17:41] <odisa> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/3YEDB/ is what I have now, but it's not working... I'm guessing I'm doing it wrong
[09:18:29] <shoky> odisa: first of all.. that calls .fadeTo/.fadeIn  on EACH scroll
[09:18:36] <Technical_13> Okay.  How do I find the wrapper element for:  <ins class="diffchange diffchange-inline">Metero Swarm in Action</ins>  OR  <del class="diffchange diffchange-inline">Metero Swarm in Action</del> BUT NOT foobar Metero Swarm in Action foobar?
[09:18:37] <shoky> pretty sure that's not what you want
[09:19:20] <odisa> shoky: so > 0 would be more appropriate?
[09:19:39] <BillCriswell> odisa: http://jsbin.com/sikumaja/1/edit?css,js,output I wrote up this example the other day not sure I ever sent
[09:19:52] <shoky> odisa: if you have an "else"  it doesnt really matter what the condition is
[09:20:01] <Technical_13> $('table.diff').html().closest(':contains(linkDestination[i].substr(0, (linkDestination[i].length - 4)))') where linkDestination[i] == Metero Swarm in Action.jpg does not work. :(
[09:20:25] <shoky> i mean.. you'll end up calling some fade method either way on each scroll. you want to use some boolean flag maybe
[09:21:14] <shoky> odisa: also btw change .fadeIn to .fadeTo(1)
[09:21:32] <anshuman> hi all. I am new to jquery. Was trying it on eclipse kepler but the autocomplete was not working... checked the same on the net but the plugin suggested (i.e. JSDT) did not work.
[09:22:24] <odisa> shoky: yeah I did that here: http://jsfiddle.net/WLqsC/ still doesn't work
[09:22:37] <odisa> BillCriswell: thanks, I might use that instead
[09:24:30] <decx> btw, cache everything before putting it in a window scroll
[09:24:37] <shoky> odisa: ah fadeTo takes duration as first param, sorry
[09:25:03] <odisa> shoky: ahh, so 'fast', 'integer' should do the trick?
[09:25:12] <shoky> odisa:  .fadeTo('fast', 0)
[09:25:25] <odisa> right, let me try that
[09:27:00] <odisa> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/xapeL/ is working great now, thanks!
[09:27:37] <decx> cache everything
[09:28:20] <shoky> odisa: that's still no good, you're queuing tons of fade animations on each scroll
[09:28:34] <odisa> shoky: yeah I figured as much..
[09:28:38] <shoky> odisa: uhh also why use 1 as duration ?
[09:28:45] <odisa> so the boolean fix BillCriswell linked would be better
[09:28:54] <odisa> well 'fast' was taking 2 seconds
[09:29:06] <odisa> so I figured 1ms would be quicker
[09:29:10] <shoky> huh
[09:29:16] <shoky> 1ms is not really an animation
[09:29:21] <shoky> do you want a fade or not
[09:29:33] <Technical_13> Meh..
[09:29:34] <decx> 1ms animation nice
[09:29:34] <odisa> it works fine for me.. looks animated
[09:29:53] <decx> what was threshold for humans? 20ms?
[09:30:21] <odisa> ehh.. I have some visual disturbances.. perhaps my threshold is different
[09:30:21] <shoky> odisa oks. but still no boolean flag
[09:30:31] <shoky> you're queuing an animation on EACH scroll
[09:30:44] <odisa> yeah, so something like this would be better? http://jsbin.com/sikumaja/1/edit
[09:31:07] <shoky> donno that's totally different
[09:31:17] <shoky> and it still does a toggleClass on EACH scroll
[09:31:29] <odisa> shoky: so what do you propose?
[09:31:45] <decx> is that what the second argument in toggleclass does?
[09:31:48] <shoky> a boolean flag  http://jsfiddle.net/3YEDB/1/
[09:33:16] <odisa> shoky: ahh interesting
[09:36:35] <shoky> and yeah, what decx said about caching
[09:37:58] <odisa> shoky: thanks, I'll use this then
[09:39:24] <odisa> shoky: oh, that's weird. works fine in the fiddle, but not on the site
[09:39:47] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery-validation and add the rule "digits" and a remote function for the validation but then it doesn't check any more for digits, only the remote function. can't i use both or how should it be done properly?
[09:40:11] <odisa> using jquery 2.1.1
[09:41:51] <odisa> nvm.. forgot the variable -.-
[10:12:06] <lostInParadise> Does $(document).ready() wait for <script src=""> tags to finish loading?
[11:04:46] <traplin> i have this code:  $.post('/Contact/Mailer', {name: name, email: email, message: message}, function (content) {, but when i use it, it says 'Illegal Invocation'
[11:04:55] <traplin> it works without the middle {}, so its got something to do with that
[11:05:03] <traplin> but i dont know why
[11:09:18] <rollingping> Hello. I have an element object named "el2". how  to remove any p>img inside it?
[11:17:15] <rollingping> okay, it was silly question :) and answer is: el2.find("img").remove();
[11:26:42] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery-validation and add the rule "digits" and a remote function for the validation but then it doesn't check any more for digits, only the remote function. can't i use both or how should it be done properly?
[12:25:09] <ADog_> Yo dudes. I am using unobtrsuve + jquery validation
[12:25:32] <ADog_> Works well, but when I use a plugin to style up my selects (chosen) they stop having validation being used
[12:25:38] <ADog_> How do I fix this?
[12:33:31] <sharpmachine> Hey smart people.  I've got a strange issue with the PageOne and scrollTo jQuery plugins.  Here's the URL: http://preview.sharpmachinemedia.com/sharpmachinemedia.com/services
[12:33:39] <sharpmachine> When you click the first button "Branding", it works.  But if you scroll back up and click it again, it's doesn't work
[12:33:46] <sharpmachine> But with the other three buttons, they consistently work fine
[12:34:21] <sharpmachine> Any ideas?
[12:38:26] <Vivekananda> hey everyone this does not work. I want to see the string "Label Value"  in the console log
[12:38:53] <sharpmachine> Hi Vivekananda.  What's this?
[12:39:30] <Vivekananda> sorry one sec  http://jsbin.com/zerilevu/5/edit
[12:40:19] <ADog_> hm I wish this channel had more activeness
[12:40:28] <Vivekananda> I am just learning and playing around with how event handler works
[12:40:43] <Vivekananda> ADog_: it is usually active in the evenings butyeah out of a tonne of people
[12:40:49] <Vivekananda> very fewactually talk
[12:41:05] <Vivekananda> but you can make it active by chatting up :)
[12:41:30] <ADog_> Vivekananda: I just need my issue resolved :p
[12:41:37] <ADog_> My clients are getting itchy
[12:41:42] <Vivekananda> oo
[12:42:04] <Vivekananda> then diversify! ie ask around in more channels
[12:42:22] <Vivekananda> btw what is the issue. I am pretty sure I wont know much but still tryiing never hurt
[12:43:49] <ADog_> Vivekananda: jquery val (or unobstrusive) breaks on selects when using plugins to style them
[12:44:15] <ADog_> It's because display: none is applied to the select
[12:46:06] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery-validation and add the rule "digits" and a remote function for the validation but then it doesn't check any more for digits, only the remote function. can't i use both or how should it be done properly?
[12:46:08] <Vivekananda> hmmm in that case I can choose pure js too but need to find out how to do it
[12:49:49] <Azrael_-> i also love the helpfullness
[12:53:54] <sharpmachine> Sometimes help takes awhile on some channels
[12:56:10] <systemfault> Unfortunately… When _I_ have a problem, no channel can ever help. :’(
[12:57:54] <tw2113> stop having such complex issues systemfault
[12:58:25] <systemfault> Yeah, I should start asking questions I can solve by using google :/
[12:58:49] <systemfault> Hmm, let’s try a fake question.
[12:59:11] <hdon> hi all, really simple demo: http://jsfiddle.net/2dLJS/ can anyone tell me why the Remove button only works on the first row of the table?
[12:59:28] <hdon> line 6 of the javascript code is the most important
[12:59:38] <hdon> everything else is probably exactly how you expect it... assuming i did my job right
[13:00:29] <systemfault> I have the following code: $('#lol').on('click', function() { alert(this.attr('data-rofl')); }); HALP MEEeee!!! (I haven't tried using $(this) instead of this because I can't google)
[13:01:22] <hdon> systemfault, you seem to be quite knowledgeable! care to take a look at my easy problem?
[13:01:35] <systemfault> hdon: IMPOSSIBRU!!
[13:01:41] <systemfault> Oh wait, let me check
[13:04:01] <systemfault> hdon: http://jsfiddle.net/2dLJS/1/
[13:04:06] * hdon clicks
[13:04:21] <systemfault> (You can remove the console.log…)
[13:04:50] <hdon> systematik, why did you add tbody?
[13:05:01] <hdon> sorry systemfault instead
[13:05:41] <hdon> systemfault, also i see that you removed the :eq(1) qualifier from the "td" selector. this is important in my application because i have multiple columns with buttons, and i use td:eq(1) and td:eq(2) etc. to distinguish between the different columns' buttons
[13:05:51] <systemfault> hdon: So it doesn't remove the add button in the footer
[13:06:13] <systemfault> hdon: Ah, that's a very bad way to deal with that problem.
[13:06:21] <systemfault> hdon: Add a class to your buttons
[13:06:23] <hdon> systemfault, what approach would you recommend?
[13:06:32] <hdon> ah... but why is :eq() a bad approach?
[13:06:57] <hdon> in my case, the table is being built from dynamic schema, and the column number is how i map the data from the table (or its elements!) to something meaningful
[13:06:58] <systemfault> hdon: Overly specific, if you change your html a bit, you break your code.
[13:07:36] <systemfault> Things like eq(number), parent(), next() without a selector… etc should be avoided
[13:07:37] <hdon> systemfault, you know, you're right. i still think this is a bug though
[13:07:54] <systemfault> Possible, I never use eq since it's not real CSS
[13:08:28] <systemfault> All the jQuery selector additions are slow...
[13:08:31] <hdon> oh.. can jQuery selectors take advantage of "real CSS" when querying the document?
[13:08:36] <hdon> ahhh very cool, i did not know that systemfault :)
[13:08:41] <hdon> thanks, i will try to keep that in mind now
[13:09:02] <systemfault> hdon: In the "happy path", yes. jQuery can use document.querySelectorAll to increase performance.
[13:09:25] <systemfault> As soon as you use the weird jQuery selectors… it's slower
[13:09:28] <Vivekananda> systemfault: was the $(this) example in response to my question ?
[13:09:43] <systemfault> Vivekananda: I don't know what your question is, so no. Sorry.
[13:10:39] <Vivekananda> oo ok. my question though is -- I want to see the string "Label Value"  in the console log .   http://jsbin.com/zerilevu/5/edit
[13:10:53] <systemfault> hdon: BTW, there's the CSS nth-child you can use instead of :eq
[13:11:06] <systemfault> hdon: Not sure why I didn't think about it before.
[13:12:55] <systemfault> Vivekananda: You'll have to give me more info… Or else, I'm just going to ask you to open your console and type: console.log('Label Value'); in it.
[13:14:42] <Vivekananda> lol. okay sure. I was just learning /testing event delegation and this example I posted works fine. I am trying access the inner text of the label node. This example I am using is part of  this page --  http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/12/an-introduction-to-dom-events/     events delegation
[13:14:53] <systemfault> Vivekananda: http://jsbin.com/zerilevu/6/edit ?
[13:17:04] <Vivekananda> systemfault: thanks but that tutorial link points out that event.target is used to access the targeted input. Shouldnt thatalso work ?
[13:17:57] <systemfault> Vivekananda: It should also work.
[13:18:03] <systemfault> .text() is what matters here.
[13:18:14] <systemfault> .val() is only for form controls.
[13:20:31] <Vivekananda> okay so lemme try
[13:21:24] <Vivekananda> systemfault: this does not work  http://jsbin.com/zerilevu/8/edit
[13:27:51] <Vivekananda> still around ? systemfault ?
[13:28:20] <systemfault> Sorry, was away.
[13:33:22] <k_89> http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/241077/difference-between-lexical-scoping-and-passing-variables-in-js
[13:38:22] <systemfault> Vivekananda: jQuery does something weird with event.target…. "this" always seems to be right though.
[13:38:44] <Vivekananda> and I wasted 3 hrs on nothing ?
[13:39:39] <Vivekananda> :(
[13:39:42] <systemfault> :(
[13:39:49] <Vivekananda> stupid browsers and jquery
[13:39:54] <systemfault> label is a weird tag also...
[13:40:03] <systemfault> Because of it's "link" to an input
[13:40:06] <systemfault> *its
[13:41:00] <Vivekananda> btw systemfault  how does this differ from $(this). I assumed that both are variables referencing to an object.
[13:41:33] <systemfault> "this" is a DOM node, $(this) is the jQuery-wrapped DOM node
[13:42:09] <systemfault> The inconsistency happens with event.target
[13:42:38] <systemfault> .target is the node that was clicked on… for some reason, it returns the checkbox
[13:42:50] <systemfault> Probably because of the link between the label and that checkbox.
[13:43:02] <systemfault> using "this" returns the label every time
[13:43:39] <zylophone> am i right in assuming that you can't put the jquery js file at the footer of the html?
[13:44:41] <systemfault> zylophone: You can put script tags wherever you want, as long as you're not calling its functions before it's included.
[13:45:04] <zylophone> isn't the recommended place for jquery in the head?
[13:45:05] <systemfault> zylophone: The usual places where to put scripts is 1) in the <head> 2) Just before the </body>
[13:46:01] <systemfault> zylophone: Define "recommended"
[13:47:09] <systemfault> zylophone: The most common practice is 1) but 2) is often better
[13:48:29] <zylophone> oh, so is that a kind of default to just put all js files in 2)
[13:48:42] <systemfault> The default is 1)
[13:48:54] <zylophone> i mean a recommended default ;)
[13:48:54] <systemfault> It's the "classic" let's put all the scripts in the HEAD
[13:49:19] <systemfault> Well, to understand 2), you need to understand how the browser deals with scripts when it loads them.
[13:49:42] <Jattenalle> 2) is the way to do easy "execute after page load"
[13:49:43] <zylophone> e.g. it loads top down, so content first, then js
[13:49:44] <Jattenalle> it's a hax
[13:49:55] <systemfault> When the page is parsed, when the browser encounters a <script> tags, it "blocks" everything to get it,
[13:50:28] <systemfault> So, it takes more time for the user to see the page
[13:50:59] <Jattenalle> if the time it takes to load a few hundred lines of js is what's slowing your service down
[13:51:02] <Jattenalle> you have bigger issues
[13:51:03] <Jattenalle> :P
[13:51:15] <systemfault> When you put your scripts at the end, the page appears more quickly because the "blocking" occurs when there's already something on the screen.
[13:51:31] <Jattenalle> except, the page would still be mostly unusable, until scripts have loaded in
[13:51:33] <Jattenalle> it's a hax.
[13:51:37] <systemfault> Jattenalle: .ready is the hax
[13:51:58] <Jattenalle> ellaborate
[13:52:08] <Jattenalle> -l
[13:52:43] <zylophone> i dunno, a few hundred lines can easily be a few thousand!
[13:53:09] <systemfault> Jattenalle: Basically, .ready/DOMContentReady only makes sense because of people not moving their scripts at the end of the page.
[13:53:12] <zylophone> i'm currently working on a small-ish app and it tops 1000 lines
[13:53:32] <systemfault> Also… The Google closure lib doesn't even had a DOMReady call.
[13:53:40] <systemfault> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/closure-library-discuss/G-7Ltdavy0E That's their reason why.
[13:53:48] <systemfault> I disagree… but still.
[13:53:55] <zylophone> so, the recommended place IS actually the footer, not the defacto heaD?
[13:54:20] <Jattenalle> but the logic is flawed...
[13:54:25] <Jattenalle> sure you present the static html faster
[13:54:35] <Jattenalle> but if you have that much JS, your site depends on it (one would hope)
[13:54:40] <systemfault> How is better user experience… flawed?
[13:54:45] <Jattenalle> so it would literally just give users a horrible experience
[13:54:49] <systemfault> Jattenalle: It's not about the quantity of JS, it's about HTTP requests
[13:54:50] <Jattenalle> with things that dont work, until it's all loaded in anyhow
[13:54:53] <Jattenalle> i know
[13:54:55] <Jattenalle> i get it
[13:55:04] <Jattenalle> i just dont see the supposed user experience benefit
[13:55:12] <Jattenalle> unless, your site mostly functions on pure html
[13:55:21] <Jattenalle> (pure, whatever.. i hope you get what i mean ;) )
[13:55:26] <systemfault> Jattenalle: The sooner people see things on the screen, the faster the website "feels" to them
[13:55:34] <Jattenalle> sure, but they can't use it
[13:55:35] <systemfault> Jattenalle: But yeah, I understand your point
[13:55:50] <Jattenalle> i've experienced a few sites that use that way of loading
[13:56:03] <Jattenalle> and it annoys me to no end to get a "dead" presentation, until it's done loading
[13:56:14] <systemfault> Jattenalle: Well yes… because the JS might have the time to load between the moment where the user sees the page and the moment where he starts interacting with it.
[13:56:17] <Jattenalle> means i have no actual visual feedback except that little spinning icon (which a lot of browsers are hiding nowadays..)
[13:56:38] <Jattenalle> i get the idea, i just don't think it actually works :/
[13:56:44] <zylophone> yeah, i kinda agree
[13:56:57] <zylophone> for content heavy sites, sure, but for js apps, it seems better to put it in the head
[13:57:09] <systemfault> Jattenalle: Also… how is DOMReady any different than putting the scripts at the end?
[13:57:19] <zylophone> and i hate how chrome just kinda freezes until the page is loaded
[13:57:37] <Jattenalle> systemfault, never said it was :)
[13:57:43] <systemfault> Jattenalle: Anything in a DOMReady event is called when the page is parsed.. (when it reached </body>)
[13:57:49] <systemfault> Ah :P
[13:57:57] <Jattenalle> but we were talking about bottom vs head
[13:58:08] <Jattenalle> and in that scenario, i dont think it matters.. at all
[13:58:15] <Jattenalle> both ways are flawed, just in different ways
[13:58:30] <Jattenalle> i like the ready method, because i know everything is loaded and i can mess with it
[13:58:37] <Jattenalle> sure, putting things at the bottom means things "should" be loaded
[13:58:45] <michelleglauser> Hi. When I click on the "help me decide" button on the page http://chishenma.herokuapp.com/choose_category/, my welcome popup and the images don't show up on the second /help_me_decide page. But if I refresh the second page or open it directly with the link (http://chishenma.herokuapp.com/help_me_decide/), the popup and images are fine. Does anyone have any idea what is going on? I'm pretty sure it's a jQuery mobile thing because Django isn't
[13:58:45] <michelleglauser> throwing any errors and neither is Heroku.
[13:58:46] <Jattenalle> until some clever browser dev optimizes something.. and you cry :P
[13:58:58] <zylophone> are we REALLY talking about bottom vs head ?
[13:59:09] <zylophone> bash.org quote?
[13:59:37] <systemfault> Jattenalle: If you use HEAD, you _NEED_ a DOMReady event.
[14:00:05] <systemfault> And the DOMReady event does  the same thing as just… putting the scripts before the </body>
[14:00:12] <Jattenalle> systemfault, aye, i'm not disagreeing with you.. i'm just saying, either way is flawed, for different reasons
[14:00:35] <systemfault> Jattenalle: What would be a non-flawed way then?
[14:01:03] <Jattenalle> i never said i had a solution, i don't even pretend to care enough to come up with one :P
[14:01:07] <systemfault> :D
[14:01:12] <Jattenalle> i just said i prefer head and domready
[14:01:30] <Jattenalle> and that i dont see the "user experience benefit" of dumping it at end
[14:02:06] <Jattenalle> in the end, both are "broken", in different ways.. one shows an empty page during load, and the other shows you a page you can't interact with during load
[14:02:16] * Jattenalle shrugs
[14:02:19] <Jattenalle> i prefer empty page
[14:13:44] <Jattenalle> i hope any fellow europeans in here made sure to vote.. if not, i'm disappoint in you.. and the disappointment of a random person on the internet is serious business.
[14:19:16] <aro> is there a way to determine if an animation is fading in or out
[14:52:58] <aro> im having problems
[14:55:56] <aro> i have a row of tiles that when you hover them, it expands them individually and displays an info box inside
[14:56:07] <aro> if i mouse over them fast, the animation is applied irregularly and erratically
[14:56:58] <aro> like, it doesnt remove the animated pseudo class
[14:59:29] <natoshi> hey guys
[14:59:52] <natoshi> i am having trouble with creating multiple setTimeouts
[14:59:57] <natoshi> and then removing specific ones
[14:59:58] <dokma> does jquery have some kind of query cache or should I var el = $('#el') to prevent looking up the same element multiple times??
[15:01:45] <aro> i think its beause my hover (out) function is being called before the in func is finished
[15:01:47] <aro> how do i handle that
[15:01:58] <xniz> dokma, you can use that.
[15:02:19] <xniz> ie; slide = $('.slide');
[15:02:46] <dokma> xniz, I know I can. That's not an answer to my question.
[15:02:52] <dokma> I'm asking if I should
[15:02:56] <dokma> is it a good practice
[15:02:59] <xniz> yes, its fine
[15:03:00] <dokma> do you guys do it?
[15:03:24] <xniz> if you have a section of code where you need to edit selector properties then yes, thats fine
[15:03:33] <xniz> err. edit them on multiple lines.
[15:03:43] <xniz> why retype it all on one line :P. just set a variable
[15:12:36] <jkolejnus> hi
[15:12:50] <jkolejnus> quick one: http://jsfiddle.net/VqC2V/
[15:13:04] <jkolejnus> how do I make the text inside a div disappear, without touching any <elements> inside it?
[15:15:48] <skyjumper> got an unusual qestion
[15:15:49] <skyjumper> question
[15:16:37] <skyjumper> i'm trying to $(container).find("tr td input.something"), but only if that input.something isn't nested inside a second table
[15:17:11] <skyjumper> so something like $(container).find("tr td not(table) input.something"), but
[15:17:28] <skyjumper> anyone done something like that?
[15:20:49] <tandroid> skyjumper something like ("tr td > input.something") ?
[15:21:07] <skyjumper> sure, but i want the input.something to still match if it's in a <div>
[15:22:07] <tandroid> That's a css selector though so you might need to do $("#container").find("div tr td").children("input.something")
[15:22:15] <tandroid> That's not a perfect selector...
[15:22:20] <tandroid> I'm sure
[15:22:46] <skyjumper> eh found this, looks like there's no simple way - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/965816/what-jquery-selector-excludes-items-with-a-parent-that-matches-a-given-selector

[15:29:21] <Vivekananda> hi everyone
[15:29:26] <Vivekananda> lemme see who is around
[15:31:52] <wa5ted> lol
[15:35:22] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: is around :)
[15:35:29] <wa5ted> lol
[15:35:32] <Vivekananda> have a rather long question though
[15:35:34] <wa5ted> yes i am
[15:35:37] <wa5ted> shoot
[15:35:42] <wa5ted> ill try to help
[15:35:43] <Vivekananda> hey everyone in the middle of sometihng and trying to wrap my head around ie to know  1.  the correct way of doing this ( efficiency neccessary )  2. Alternative ways of doing.  I have  an html page.  Input checkboxes submit data to back end database   using jquery.  Php code retrieves the data from database and populates div.  Both these parts are working independently but I want to do it so that  php  retrieves data (  ie refreshes div) right aft
[15:35:43] <Vivekananda> er the data has been submitted.  My questions   1.   How do I make php code run right after the data submit .  Submit is being done by js/jquery    2. should I completely delete the php code and use js/jquery to send and receive code and then populate. ?    I know I can do the second one but wish to know if I can do the first one or not ?
[15:36:12] <Vivekananda> my php code is embedded on the html page itself !!
[15:37:00] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: rule of thumb, atleast this is what i do, unless its on page load, i always run my queries to a db via $.ajax
[15:37:02] <wa5ted> to php
[15:37:14] <wa5ted> i literally event.preventDefault() the sumbit button
[15:37:18] <wa5ted> submit
[15:37:21] <wa5ted> and do my own request
[15:37:27] <Braad> same here
[15:37:34] <Vivekananda> hmm yes I would too do that
[15:37:39] <wa5ted> well youd do
[15:37:41] <wa5ted> a$.get
[15:37:46] <wa5ted> and then send your vars
[15:37:55] <wa5ted> let me see if i have an example
[15:38:59] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: joi nme and ill show you
[15:39:00] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=3Ij6odfzI3
[15:39:02] <wa5ted> ^^
[15:40:19] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: are you watching
[15:40:44] <Vivekananda> lemme explain the issue. My page currently had just retrieving functionality ie whatever was in tables was shown up and it was using php  in the html itself to do it  ( questoin : is this sensible to mix php with html or stupid? ) .. Now I have created a form + checkboxes and I have got submit functionality too.  I was hoping that since retrieving part was already there , IF, I could fire it right after the submission completes then all is well. ot
[15:40:44] <Vivekananda> herwise I would have to rewrite parts.    The second thing is that the php code takes into account  the session variable ( ie  user is logged in ) to display the data and I dont know how to do this in case of jquery/js ?
[15:41:10] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: yep watching but typing
[15:41:44] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: what im showing you is how to do a jquer yto php to db and back
[15:41:46] <wa5ted> request
[15:41:51] <wa5ted> you hcoose the way you wanna do it
[15:41:56] <wa5ted> im showigny ou how you would do it
[15:43:45] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: if you can then plz show me how to run a php code on the html page right after an ajax returns success !
[15:43:56] <wa5ted> php
[15:44:06] <wa5ted> oh all you do is do an echo at the end of your php code
[15:44:12] <wa5ted> and then echo a div around the content
[15:44:21] <wa5ted> and then what i do is se .find
[15:44:25] <wa5ted> or .match
[15:44:26] <wa5ted> in jquery
[15:44:41] <wa5ted> and find the div with relvent cotnent and then return that content to the approriate div
[15:44:54] <wa5ted> so php writes it
[15:45:01] <wa5ted> and you jsut copy the content and use js to repaste
[15:45:19] <wa5ted> Braad: any resources he can use
[15:46:56] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: currently my php code does these parts  --  1. verify if user is logged in   2. connect to database  and retrive table data  3. echo div and ul+li and paste the data in the li .   Now my question is once my  jquery finishes the ajax  how do I tell php to do step  2 and  3 again ?
[15:46:58] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: here, this is an exmaple i did for some recently

[15:47:16] <wa5ted> oh you want that part to repeat
[15:47:22] <wa5ted> put it on a set time internval
[15:48:12] <wa5ted> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh453487.aspx
[15:48:26] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: ahaa yes I could do that but that is kind of inefficient isnt it ?   I know it will work but isnt there a way to trigger php in the  .done()  or .success() of js  ajax ?
[15:48:44] <wa5ted> you wnat to check immediately after the next ajax call
[15:48:54] <wa5ted> that will leave the system locked a bit
[15:49:06] <wa5ted> if you are jdut updating to see if the server has new data
[15:49:12] <wa5ted> id do a set time interval
[15:49:33] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: based on the app youve described id use a technology called meteor
[15:49:45] <wa5ted> its built for this kinda of thing and would make your life 10x easier
[15:50:43] <Vivekananda> no what I want is this ---  1. user logs in  2. chooses  a favorite fruit ( say mango)  3. jquery takes the input and puts it in the database 'favorites' table.  4. jquery then tells php code on the client page to   refresh the div  ie add the  mango  inside the favorites table visible
[15:51:12] <wa5ted> lol
[15:51:18] <wa5ted> this is the stuff that meteor is built for
[15:51:20] <wa5ted> anyways
[15:51:24] <Vivekananda> okay
[15:51:27] <wa5ted> if you want to do that
[15:51:30] <systemfault> Nobody cares about meteor :/
[15:51:31] <wa5ted> thvia php
[15:51:47] <wa5ted> systemfault: its making this communicating to the srever issues
[15:51:50] <wa5ted> a lot easier
[15:51:53] <wa5ted> and less of a pain
[15:52:02] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: if you still wanna do the php route
[15:52:05] <wa5ted> do it on .done
[15:52:07] <systemfault> wa5ted: I'm sure it does… just not sure how well it scales.
[15:52:46] <wa5ted> its in infancy sure, but its got lots of potential
[15:52:52] <wa5ted> and for his use case it seems fine
[15:52:55] <wa5ted> then again
[15:53:01] <wa5ted> i doubt fruit is the final goal XD
[15:53:05] <wa5ted> okay guys im out
[15:53:08] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: of course but what do I do in the done ? how do I say :  hey php line number 200 on the  mypage.html  start executing !
[15:53:11] <wa5ted> be back soon
[15:53:21] <Vivekananda> lol
[15:53:22] <Vivekananda> okay
[15:54:16] <systemfault> Vivekananda: What?
[15:54:48] <Vivekananda> systemfault: you missed a bit of the exchange :)
[15:55:04] <systemfault> Vivekananda: You have your main page rendered using PHP. Then you create another one to process the form… that page returns JSON containing the info you need.
[15:56:42] <Vivekananda> systemfault: currently  the issue is the php code for retrival and update page is already written . The code for inputting new data was not and I am writing that BUT in js.  What I wanted to do is to make the first code run right after  a new input has been trigerred
[15:58:08] <systemfault> Vivekananda: What code?
[15:58:39] <Vivekananda> the 'php code for retrieval and update page'
[15:58:44] <systemfault> You send your info to the PHP server, the server sends back JSON… then you use jQuery to create nodes from that JSON… and add it to a list
[15:58:57] <systemfault> Vivekananda: PHP is not updating the page, JS is.
[16:01:51] <Vivekananda> systemfault: I understand what you are saying and agree too. If I were starting from scratch then that is what I would do but right now I am not. I have already present php code  on the html that retrives data from database and 'echoes' a div  and fills it up.  I can delete this entire thing and just create the div using js and populte the page as you said but I was wondering if deleting the php retrieval code is  the only way  ie  can I not use it
[16:01:51] <Vivekananda>   too by asking  it to execute right after  the js/jquery   inserts the new data in database and signals and okay
[16:02:28] <Vivekananda> signals an*  okay
[16:02:58] <systemfault> Vivekananda: So, you get a html fragment from the ajax call or a full page?
[16:04:00] <Vivekananda> neither . the ajax call if successful just sends back  ok done. I store the input  ( it is single input at a time ) on the front end itself  in a variable and can justuse it to populate the div
[16:04:22] <Vivekananda> well actually you know what I think I know what to do
[16:04:28] <systemfault> Vivekananda: So do it in the .done(function() {})
[16:04:51] <systemfault> I know what you want to do, I just don't know all your constraints
[16:04:59] <Vivekananda> I will leave the php as is coz it just works once during creation and will use the ajax to update the ul's
[16:05:15] <Vivekananda> hmm that should work :)
[16:05:22] <systemfault> Vivekananda: That's probably the way to go :D
[16:06:08] <Braad> Vivekananda: slim down the php file that you make the ajax call to so that it only returns the database information that you need
[16:06:44] <Vivekananda> yep :) . The only issue MIGHT be if no user is logged in . then the div is not even created in the first place but if the jquery executes ( coz it is part of the page.readY)  it wont find the div and I will get console error messages
[16:07:33] <Vivekananda> Braad: I am creating a new php file for each separate ajax request  from the same page. I hope this is good practice
[16:08:28] <Braad> Vivekananda: better to keep them all in one file, call it functions.php or something
[16:09:23] <Braad> Vivekananda: then send a parameter along with your ajax call to specify which request you want
[16:09:29] <Vivekananda> Braad: really ? and if I do a "POST" to that file  from all different ajax requests the requests might get all confused ie which function to go to
[16:09:42] <Vivekananda> ooo okay
[16:09:49] <Vivekananda> but why is this good practice ?
[16:10:18] <Vivekananda> also it looks much like having different files . What is the difference ? ( apart from the extra parameter )
[16:10:42] <Braad> Vivekananda: only really matters if you end up having lots of separate php functions being called to
[16:11:07] <Braad> Vivekananda: but it's nice to keep general php functions like that in one file rather than each in their own separate file
[16:11:58] <Braad> Vivekananda: also, there's a big difference here between php templates and php functions
[16:12:32] <Braad> Vivekananda: it sounds like you have a php template, which contains inline php function calls that grab data from the database
[16:12:52] <Vivekananda> Braad: that is new to me. I know functions but havent used templates much. IN this case I am talking ( I guess) more of functions ie the php code that post or get requests go to for posting or getting more in fo
[16:12:55] <Braad> Vivekananda: if you ajax to a php template, you're going to get a whole page back
[16:13:56] <Vivekananda> Braad: yep I have that php template but also have other .php files  which are explicitly doing the database requests and responses and have no html elements in them
[16:14:07] <Braad> Vivekananda: oh, okay good
[16:14:56] <Vivekananda> Braad: is mixing php code in html ( in the template ) especially mixing php code that talks to database a good idea or a bad one ?
[16:15:03] <Braad> Vivekananda: then yeah, ajax call to those php files, and then fire any more js on whatever event is most appropriate, either .done() or directly in the callback
[16:16:00] <Braad> Vivekananda: I like to separate my functions into a functions.php file, then in my templates I might call these functions, passing arguments to them
[16:16:20] <Vivekananda> makes sense
[16:16:47] <Braad> are you using a cms here?
[16:16:55] <Vivekananda> yep
[16:16:57] <Vivekananda> git
[16:17:02] <Vivekananda> without it would be dead
[16:17:12] <Vivekananda> oo wait
[16:17:16] <Braad> git is version control, a cms is a content management system
[16:17:21] <Vivekananda> is git what you meant or something else sorry
[16:17:21] <Braad> like wordpress or drupal
[16:17:36] <Braad> where'd the php come from?
[16:17:41] <Vivekananda> oo ok sorry no I am not but soon to switch it to drupal
[16:17:46] <Vivekananda> hand coded
[16:17:54] <Braad> nice
[16:18:07] <Vivekananda> but have to transition to drupal soon. I wonder if that will be vrey difficult
[16:18:19] <Braad> well, even if you don't use them, I would definitely look at the overall php architecture of Wordpress and Drupal, if you're interested
[16:18:45] <Braad> they are both really well done, and I generally follow the wordpress architecture when working with php
[16:23:27] <Vivekananda> Braad: the thing is that I used the java based spring framework for a bit and it is such a behemoth it scared me to an extent. Could get neither head nor tail of how to do stuff and on top of that I was doing a project involving maven and hibernate along with it. I was hoping that drupal and stuff are not that complicated
[16:23:29] <Vivekananda> are they ?
[16:23:49] <Vivekananda> still wish to get better at spring though
[16:24:16] <Braad> honestly, wordpress is unstoppable, and once you start using it you'll never go back
[16:24:29] <Braad> I would say it's very straightforward
[16:24:34] <Braad> Drupal also
[16:24:52] <damasceno> Hello. I need to use listview, when I do it works but it changes all my HTML SELECT fields, does anyone have a problem like this one? It changes all my css. Is there only the listview part so I can create a .js file and use it? thanks.
[16:24:58] <erming> so, they've fixed bloated base themes in Drupal now?
[16:26:42] <Braad> erming: you're probably right, I haven't actually used Drupal in a couple years
[16:35:25] <Vivekananda> while reading online I read that drupal is more complicated but it
[16:39:51] <erming> it is what? "more customizable".. like people say about all bloated and horrible code bases? :>
[16:40:40] <Vivekananda> but it is more flexible and wordpress impresses more coz has in built themese and stuff but not that flexible
[16:42:22] <Vivekananda> I was reading this too erming  https://www.udemy.com/blog/drupal-vs-joomla-vs-wordpress/
[16:42:32] <Vivekananda> esp the cons of wordpress vs drupal
[16:44:56] <damasceno> Hello. I need to use listview, when I do it works but it changes all my HTML SELECT fields, does anyone have a problem like this one? It changes all my css. Is there only the listview part so I can create a .js file and use it? thanks.
[16:46:25] <erming> interesting infographic
[16:47:26] <erming> damasceno: listview? got some code you can show us? (http://pastebin.org or http://jsfiddle.net/)
[16:51:33] <Vivekananda> erming: have you used drupal ?
[16:51:44] <Vivekananda> and has anyone used spring for that matter
[17:00:45] <damasceno> erming: http://www.smarthotel.com.br/test/pt/hotels.html See? It should have only one OPTION but the Jquery Mobile .js file is creating another option and also changing the color and so on...
[17:04:55] <damasceno> erming: if I remove the Jquery mobile file from the Header, the select (On your right corner) will be shown as it should be but the listview will not work. :S
[17:09:54] <erming> Vivekanada: I was forced to work with it some years ago.. That's why I don't like it :)
[17:12:49] <erming> damasceno: i'm trying to figure out what is working, and what is actually wrong.. but it looks pretty horrible right now
[17:13:37] <damasceno> erming: you see the select where you can choose the language? PT and EN?
[17:13:53] <erming> yeah
[17:14:01] <erming> they're duplicate, and that's the problem, right?
[17:15:11] <damasceno> erming: yes. Please reload the page.
[17:15:19] <erming> done
[17:15:21] <erming> looks better :)
[17:15:31] <damasceno> Now it's fine but as you can see the listview doesn't work.
[17:15:52] <damasceno> I just removed the Jquery Mobile .js files from the page and that's it.
[17:16:19] <damasceno> if I add it, the listview works but the SELECT becomes a mess.
[17:17:56] <erming> damasceno, add it again
[17:18:06] <damasceno> erming: sure, one second.
[17:18:25] <erming> might be some javascript error in jquery-mobile.js, which breaks the custom-select javascript from running or something
[17:19:17] <damasceno> erming: done. Please reload the page.
[17:19:45] <damasceno> I've been trying to figure it out since 5 p.m, now it's 9:20 here and I give up...
[17:21:17] <erming> damasceno: while you might not find your solution here, atleast someone else has had this problem before: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14926991/jquery-mobile-why-does-select-menu-break-when-i-append-it-to-another-dom-node-o
[17:24:52] <erming> damasceno!
[17:24:57] <erming> add data-role="none" to your <select>
[17:25:05] <erming> and see if that solves it
[17:26:27] <damasceno> erming: It WOOOOOORKS! Thank you very much man! Thanks a million! :D:D:D
[17:27:17] <erming> np! found it here: http://api.jquerymobile.com/selectmenu/, some paragraphs down
[19:09:44] <sammych> okay, so this is a pickle/wrinkle: suppose you have an MVC or whatever kind of front end thing. That system will periodically return the current data state back to the server. The backend 'trusts' all the data being sent from the front end (which means that the front end deals with read only/disabled fields etc). The pickle (I love pickles, btw) is that the end user can craft their own POST and send it to the server with their own data. The backend
[19:10:41] <systemfault> First.. your message was cut in the middle.
[19:11:05] <sammych> where abouts?
[19:11:15] <sammych> okay, so this is a pickle/wrinkle: suppose you have an MVC or whatever kind of front end thing. That system will periodically return the current data state back to the server.
[19:11:20] <sammych> The backend 'trusts' all the data being sent from the front end (which means that the front end deals with read only/disabled fields etc).
[19:11:24] <sammych> The pickle (I love pickles, btw) is that the end user can craft their own POST and send it to the server with their own data. The backend has no concept of what is a read only field.
[19:12:05] <systemfault> Well, the backend cannot "trust" anything from the client.
[19:12:41] <sammych> trust is too strong a word, but the backend just stores what they entered
[19:14:16] <sammych> but some data is displayed for the convienience of the current user, but that data is read only. There mere fact that the data is being displayed in some format means that the server is open for it to be changed
[19:14:34] <sammych> *will accept updates to that field
[19:14:57] <systemfault> I don't know what you're doing… but it's damn weird.
[19:15:24] <systemfault> On the backend, you have controllers… it's "their" job to validate input… to do security checks.. etc.
[19:17:17] <sammych> yeah, I've always known that. Just the platform we're using doesn't make it that easy to keep a before and after snapshot
[19:17:44] <wa5ted> can osme one tell me how to get my page to smoothly scroll like this one http://www.benoitchalland.com/
[19:17:50] <wa5ted> i can seem to findthe releventcdoe
[19:17:53] <wa5ted> code*
[19:18:04] <sammych> I was hoping for a 'good enough' way to obfuscate the process
[19:59:02] <latemus> I have a form which i am stepping through using js to set elementById.display=block. i'm using a button with an onclick event <button type="button" onclick="ShowContent('m2')">Next</button> to step through to the final submit button. i'm using jquery.validate.js to validate all inputs using onsubmit. i need to have each "next" button validate the few elements that are visible at that time, rather than having the final submit button actually run the validat
[20:12:20] <Vivekananda> hi everyone
[20:13:17] <piercedwater> hi
[20:48:48] <wa5ted> hi
[20:48:55] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: did your issue get solved
[20:52:10] <xniz> hi wa5ted
[20:52:39] <wa5ted> xniz: hey
[20:52:55] <xniz> Im having a problem... :(. trying to figure out how to load image elements dynamically with jquery
[20:53:08] <xniz> and stuff them into  the specified <div>
[20:53:12] <xniz> i was assuming using .append but idk
[20:53:20] <wa5ted> yeah
[20:53:23] <wa5ted> img tags
[20:53:30] <wa5ted> create an element
[20:53:44] <xniz> indeed
[20:54:47] <wa5ted> right now im trying to replicate the sooth scrolling of this site
[20:54:48] <wa5ted> http://www.benoitchalland.com/
[20:55:41] <xniz> wow that looks neat
[20:57:15] <wa5ted> yeah
[20:57:20] <wa5ted> trying to figure it out
[20:57:24] <wa5ted> friends is disecting tha code
[20:57:28] <wa5ted> cause he wants to use it too
[20:59:45] <xniz> aha i figured it out :p
[21:02:06] <xniz> now.. when using append from jquery... when i view my website source after rendering.. I dont see it in the source file... that is normal? considering it was created dynamically
[21:03:10] <wa5ted> ywa
[21:03:12] <wa5ted> yes
[21:04:30] <xniz> alright. thanks :D
[21:11:33] <wa5ted> np
[21:11:41] <wa5ted> systemfault: you around
[21:11:47] <wa5ted> need your help with some stuff
[21:44:09] <Vivekananda> am back
[21:44:21] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: around still. Sorry to ping directly
[21:44:38] <wa5ted> np
[21:44:40] <wa5ted> what up
[21:45:05] <wa5ted> Vivekananda: ^
[21:45:30] <Vivekananda> ooo hey
[21:45:37] <Vivekananda> so I have an issue am trying to resolve
[21:46:38] <Vivekananda> my landing page has a header.php component. It has php code that also takes care of session variable. now  during some js / jquery manupulation I need to find if the session['user id'] has been set or not .
[21:48:02] <Vivekananda> I can do an ajax post or something but where do I 'post' it to ?   to the header.php ?  or do  i create a new php file just for this ? also the header does not echo anything so if I do 'post' to it I wont get a response
[21:50:12] <wa5ted> i dont know why you have to crate antoher php file
[21:50:18] <wa5ted> if you need to check it
[21:50:26] <wa5ted> yes youll have to do an ajax request
[21:50:34] <wa5ted> what i do
[21:50:41] <wa5ted> is stick all my php into hte index
[21:50:44] <wa5ted> and avoid doing
[21:50:48] <wa5ted> include()....
[22:08:00] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: so what do I do with the ajax request ?
[22:08:13] <wa5ted> you send a request
[22:08:16] <wa5ted> like a $.get
[22:08:17] <Vivekananda> post ?  and post to where ? which php ? header.php ?
[22:08:17] <wa5ted> in js
[22:08:20] <wa5ted> to the php file
[22:08:33] <Vivekananda> but which php. to the header.php directly ?
[22:08:35] <wa5ted> you can actually specify where it gets posted
[22:08:41] <wa5ted> yes
[22:08:52] <wa5ted> acutally wait
[22:08:54] <wa5ted> sendto the index
[22:08:55] <Vivekananda> but would nt that be kind of stupid
[22:08:56] <Vivekananda> ?
[22:08:56] <wa5ted> page
[22:08:58] <wa5ted> tell you why
[22:09:03] <wa5ted> cause user_id
[22:09:06] <Vivekananda> to the index page itself !!
[22:09:07] <wa5ted> is a SESSION var
[22:09:21] <wa5ted> or the page wher ethe header is being included
[22:09:26] <Vivekananda> but that is client side code ! how does it know of the variable ?
[22:09:33] <wa5ted> SESSION var means it can be acccessed from any hwere in the php
[22:09:38] <wa5ted> it doesnt
[22:09:41] <wa5ted> hencethe $.get
[22:12:52] <Vivekananda> I just read this  http://us3.php.net/function.session-start
[22:14:12] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: my header.php does not do any 'echoes' or returns at the moment. It is just a part of the  index.php . if I do  a post directed to it I will have to echo the result back
[22:14:36] <wa5ted> what you dont understand
[22:14:49] <wa5ted> is $_SESSION vars are univerisal to all php files
[22:14:54] <wa5ted> hence why they are session vars
[22:14:59] <wa5ted> so you can query any page for it
[22:15:03] <wa5ted> and it should tell you
[22:15:48] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: lemme also tell you what the central issue is though. my shopping cart  has a section  called fruits.  and if you are logged in as a user you can click on a fruit to add it to a favorites list.  If you are not logged in hower , I need  that  on clicking  'apple'  or any other fruit you get a pop up saying :  please log in to save favorites
[22:16:50] <Vivekananda> wa5ted: if it is a global then can't I just query the variable itself rather than querying a page FOR it ?
[22:17:03] <wa5ted> well how are you gonna send that variable
[22:17:18] <Vivekananda> currently I need the variable inside my js function
[22:17:25] <wa5ted> exactly
[22:17:32] <wa5ted> so you need to query it from the php
[22:18:04] <Vivekananda> ummm I assumed that I could just do  :  var  sessionStatus =  $_SESSION['userid'] ;   anywhere in the js function
[22:18:09] <Vivekananda> isnt this possible ?
[22:18:12] <wa5ted> no
[22:18:14] <wa5ted> how?
[22:18:23] <wa5ted> js has no concept of PHP
[22:18:27] <wa5ted> its client side
[22:18:31] <wa5ted> hence why eteor
[22:18:33] <wa5ted> rules supreme
[22:18:37] <Vivekananda> ok
[22:18:39] <wa5ted> you can do stuff like that
[22:18:40] <wa5ted> :P
[22:18:42] <wa5ted> jks
[22:18:45] <wa5ted> dont use meteor
[22:18:48] <wa5ted> its the easy way out
[22:18:51] <wa5ted> but yeah
[22:18:56] <wa5ted> you need to do an AJAX query
[22:19:00] <Vivekananda> no meteor now plz. I am already confused enough without introducing new stuff :)
[22:19:10] <Vivekananda> ok so ajax query
[22:19:19] <wa5ted> yeah
[22:19:35] <Vivekananda> so I write an ajax query  and point it to the index page itself  or the header.php
[22:19:42] <wa5ted> index
[22:19:44] <wa5ted> id say
[22:19:47] <wa5ted> grab the session var
[22:19:50] <wa5ted> send it back
[22:20:19] <Vivekananda> now questoin is ,  the index page needs to 'return' or 'echo' somethingn  so that the ajax query gets a returned  data:    parameter
[22:20:44] <wa5ted> well what id do
[22:20:46] <wa5ted> is
[22:20:49] <wa5ted> do
[22:21:02] <Vivekananda> okay but currently the index page or header.php is not  returning ( ie echoing) anything
[22:21:25] <Vivekananda> go ahead I am listening
[22:21:27] <wa5ted> echo "<div class'userIDVar'>[VAR GOES HERE]</div>";
[22:21:42] <wa5ted> that way when you sift through the returned data
[22:21:45] <wa5ted> in the .done callback
[22:21:49] <wa5ted> you can locate that div
[22:21:55] <wa5ted> did you get the link i sent
[22:21:57] <wa5ted> you
[22:22:04] <Vivekananda> nope

[22:22:17] <Vivekananda> yes lemme look
[22:22:26] <wa5ted> it contains what you need to do a successful ajax query
[22:22:49] <wa5ted> there and back again

[22:23:10] <wa5ted> and tstuff
[22:23:15] <wa5ted> i forgot to take out
[22:23:17] <wa5ted> it was for a client
[22:24:36] <Vivekananda> couldnt you gimme a simpler example instead
[22:24:48] <Vivekananda> like just a jquery function or something
[22:24:53] <wa5ted> well what im trying to show you is in the .done callback
[22:25:06] <Vivekananda> that rar is not unrarring
[22:25:11] <wa5ted> lol okay
[22:25:13] <wa5ted> um
[22:25:18] <wa5ted> well when yous end your ajax query
[22:25:24] <wa5ted> id echo the results you want like this
[22:25:26] <wa5ted> echo "<div class'userIDVar'>[VAR GOES HERE]</div>";
[22:25:57] <wa5ted> and then in my .done
[22:26:00] <wa5ted> id do
[22:26:15] <wa5ted> $(data).filter('userIDVar');
[22:26:19] <wa5ted> and then get its contents

[22:28:03] <Vivekananda> lemme pm for a sec
[22:28:11] <wa5ted> aight
[22:28:19] <thinkxl> how good is to do this String.prototype._encode = function() { return encodeURIComponent(this); };
[22:28:19] <thinkxl> it is something not recommended, or I can use it without problems?
[22:28:59] <schnoodles-a> Hey I am wondering if there is a problem here. I am doing $('[data-seed="1401082007929"]'); and it brings back [] but when I do $('.header__close').data(); I get back Object {seed: 1401082007929, confirm: "Are you sure that you want to log out?"}
[22:29:17] <schnoodles-a> Anyone know why the jquery version of getting the element is not working ?
[22:29:31] <tw2113> you're not specifying a data attribute to fetch?
[22:33:56] <schnoodles-a> I am. Some of the objects were added post load so I am using live equivelant of on but I am not sure if that matters.
[22:39:15] <allsociety> http://jsperf.com/acid-vs-jquery
[22:52:30] <schnoodles-a> tw2113, any idea what could be triggering it. I can show you my code if you want.
[22:52:47] <tw2113> nope
[23:27:12] <axscode> http://oi59.tinypic.com/2qn8why.jpg <-- how can i access object 0 and object 1 in here?
[23:27:56] <nodedfree> axscode, you need to divide the name and the number, then increase and merge
[23:28:02] <nodedfree> same for the lname
[23:28:18] <axscode> sorry i dont get that..
[23:28:30] <nodedfree> you want auto name1 name2 name3...?
[23:28:45] <axscode> i just want to access it
[23:29:18] <axscode> object.0.field_exec_contact_fname seems not possible
[23:29:33] <nodedfree> array[0].field_bl_contact_fname
[23:29:52] <axscode> i will try that again..
[23:29:57] <nodedfree> it won't work
[23:30:06] <nodedfree> how you get the array?
[23:30:22] <axscode> it says object not array so i dont know how to access it
[23:30:34] <axscode> result from json
[23:30:40] <nodedfree> jQuery.parseJSON(data);
[23:30:45] <nodedfree> then
[23:30:59] <nodedfree> data[0].field_bl_contact_fname
[23:31:07] <axscode> testing
[23:31:27] <nodedfree> axscode, data =  jQuery.parseJSON(data)
[23:31:42] <axscode> yep testing now
[23:34:22] <axscode> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of null
[23:34:53] <axscode> var contacts = jQuery.parseJSON(data.exec_contacts); fname.val(contacts[x].field_bl_contact_fname);
[23:35:10] <axscode> where x = 0;
