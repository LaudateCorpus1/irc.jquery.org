[00:03:55] <gadlol> I tried that but it does not work... It only works when you click on the flash, it gets focused (somehow). If you click on ant other page element the scrolling still happens when you hover the mouse cursor over the flash
[00:05:40] <Whirl3d> did you try using .on? maybe even on the body level?
[00:05:55] <Whirl3d> Im not sure how events are passed to flash objects...
[00:08:01] <Whirl3d> maybe you could select all object not the flash container and manage the scroll event
[00:10:32] * _unary doh
[00:24:29] <Whirl3d> how do you select by property value?
[00:25:37] <Whirl3d> $("[opacity='0']")
[01:10:43] <niftylettuce_> anyone have an idea how to fake a file upload using a file's base64 string that is in the DOM?
[01:46:37] <Blaster> Anyone know why IE 7 might be triggering my error handler in an Ajax function?
[01:46:50] <Browser> Hello all!
[01:48:51] <Brodingo_> Blaster:  trailing comma maybe
[01:49:09] <Browser> I am trying pass information between three pages. They are three forms, and i want to show the data at  the end. Should i use a dictionary and submit events where i save the data in the dictionary?
[01:49:40] <Blaster> Brodingo: http://pastebin.com/QHuUjxCg
[02:22:11] <VarunBatra_> I was wondering: Considering scale from 1 to 10, how much you will scale it? 0 being way too bad. 10 being way too good. http://dev.language-learning.net/js/googleMaps.js and http://dev.language-learning.net/js/common.js Multiple overviews will be appreciated
[02:22:26] <VarunBatra_> No reasons but just your thoughts.
[02:34:15] <Symbi0nt|GER> what is the easies way to prevent a submit event in a large form inside a single textfield?
[02:34:35] <Symbi0nt|GER> when this is on focus, enter should not execute the submit
[02:35:27] <VarunBatra_> It will be submit anyways. How about you disable enter button entirely?
[02:36:29] <Symbi0nt|GER> nope, this textfield acts like a filter for the other form elements, so an accidently enter in the filter textfield is pointless, but will submit the entire form
[02:39:08] <VarunBatra_> Then bind the whole form with 'onsubmit' with event.PreventDefault(); return false. I don't know the correct answer. I am here for review codes if you can help. I although disabled enter key in my site.
[02:39:30] <VarunBatra_> Considering scale from 1 to 10, how much you will scale it? 0 being way too bad. 10 beingway too good. http://dev.language-learning.net/js/googleMaps.js and http://dev.language-learning.net/js/common.js Multiple overviews will be appreciated
[02:42:46] <NodeX> Symbi0nt|GER : watch the keydown and check if type== input and keyCode == enter key and return false
[02:45:33] <VarunBatra_> Hi there
[02:45:47] <NodeX> Your code could do with an overhaul
[02:45:57] <NodeX> you can save alot of lines
[02:47:03] <VarunBatra_> Yes I know, how about on scale? Considering every thing in jQuery book, global, eval etc, object, anonymous functions
[02:47:30] <NodeX> jQuery book ?
[02:47:43] <VarunBatra_> Javascript :)
[02:48:21] <NodeX> you're using eval which is evil so I would recommned not using it if possible
[02:48:26] <VarunBatra_> We do a scale basically, from 0 to 10 we say 10 if it is very good, 0 if it is very bad.
[02:48:34] <NodeX> 5
[02:48:47] <VarunBatra_> Nice to know, both combined?
[02:49:27] <NodeX> I'm not sure what you are trying to do with the Maps one
[02:49:35] <NodeX> so it's hard to rate
[02:51:06] <VarunBatra_> It is ok. NodeX one thing is sort of pissing me off. I know not to use Global Variables but suppose I have to use somehow and I can't avoid it. Condition is there are 15 variables and I can reduce it with associated array or I can reduce it with object with 15 members. Do you think any of them will be better approch?
[02:51:50] <NodeX> it depends what you are trying to achieve
[02:52:11] <NodeX> some context would help ... also you use live() without a prefix which is bad
[02:52:44] <VarunBatra_> When you said prefix what does that implies?
[02:53:59] <NodeX> an id .. $("#foo .class").live...
[02:54:14] <NodeX> else it bubbles up the DOM to the body and then the document iirc
[02:54:22] <VarunBatra_> Ok it will not parse all?
[02:54:28] <NodeX> so either add an id prefix
[02:54:32] <NodeX> use delegate
[02:54:37] <NodeX> or add a context
[02:54:43] <VarunBatra_> Parsing of dom is horrible. So it will first find #foo then find class in it. Is it?
[02:55:01] <NodeX> it's not the lookup .. "live" works differently
[02:55:08] <VarunBatra_> jQuery had something in vicinity/neighbor stuff.
[02:55:38] <NodeX> the event bubbles up wiht live to it's nearest ID'd parent which if not specified is either body or document
[02:55:58] <VarunBatra_> I see.
[02:56:00] <NodeX> it's very inneficient to call it without context
[02:56:15] <VarunBatra_> I got it.
[02:56:18] <NodeX> and people in here especialy will tel you not to use live at all because of this
[02:56:24] <VarunBatra_> Yes I do agree.
[02:56:40] <VarunBatra_> But when I am doing pagination it has to be done. What other things I can do?
[02:57:02] <VarunBatra_> Do you think onClick="javascript: doFoo();return false;" is better than live?
[02:57:03] <NodeX> give it some sort of ID
[02:57:24] <NodeX> $("#pagination-container .className").live..
[02:57:31] <VarunBatra_> Ok like #foo . class
[02:57:35] <NodeX> correct
[02:57:37] <VarunBatra_> Yes Yes perfect.
[02:57:47] <VarunBatra_> Now tell me where you writing blog so that I can learn more :)
[02:57:49] <NodeX> or you can do $(".classname","#context")
[02:58:00] <VarunBatra_> Inside live?
[02:58:10] <NodeX> $(".classname","#context").live(...
[02:58:14] <VarunBatra_> $.live('.classname','#context')
[02:58:15] <NodeX> they are identical iirc
[02:58:18] <VarunBatra_> Ok I got it.
[02:58:28] <VarunBatra_> What is fullform of iirc?
[02:58:34] <NodeX> if i recall correctly
[02:58:43] <VarunBatra_> Ok.
[02:58:50] <NodeX> you need to cache your objects too
[02:58:57] <VarunBatra_> Where you are on internet?
[02:59:07] <VarunBatra_> Blog/Profile.
[02:59:24] <NodeX> I notice you do alot ... var foo=$("#bar").val(); ... var foobar=$("#bar").html();
[02:59:36] <NodeX> I dont blog lol, I don't have time
[03:00:10] <VarunBatra_> Then I appreciate that you are giving me time.
[03:00:14] <NodeX> you should cache the object once ... var element=$("#bar"); ... var a=element.html(); var b = element.prop("href"); ..
[03:00:50] <VarunBatra_> I believe now you might reconsider rating on javascript files I have given :)
[03:01:01] <VarunBatra_> What is new rating? 5?
[03:01:40] <VarunBatra_> Functions inside it (function($){}) are isolated funcitons
[03:02:10] <NodeX> http://pastebin.com/7FuZ1Q6K
[03:02:22] <NodeX> use tenery operators when you can to save lines of code!
[03:02:52] <NodeX> that (function($... is a self executing closed function
[03:03:13] <NodeX> self executing provided it ends with ();
[03:03:37] <VarunBatra_> Yes google compiler does that. I think typeof variable === 'undefined' is better than simple variable == 'undefined' iirc
[03:03:57] <VarunBatra_> I see, so as soon as page load or js load?
[03:04:02] <VarunBatra_> I mean dom ready or load?
[03:04:27] <NodeX> $(document).ready...
[03:04:41] <NodeX> there is a shortcut but I never remmeber it
[03:04:49] <VarunBatra_> Ok
[03:05:20] <NodeX> $(function(){ your_func(); });<-- document.ready shortcut
[03:05:38] <VarunBatra_> This seems to be way lighter
[03:05:58] <VarunBatra_> Ok in respect to performance  what will you will give to www.deftinfotech.com website? I think I did spend lot of time in it.
[03:07:46] <VarunBatra_> I believe navigation is better. I also worked on newzealand.com but I am not happy with output. My codes were shit. I am reading javascript blogs to improve myself. Your comments especially about ternary operater and context is very new for me.
[03:07:49] <NodeX> it's slow for me
[03:08:41] <VarunBatra_> NodeX are you on twitter?
[03:08:51] <NodeX> no
[03:08:57] <Blaster> any way to make the fade in and fadeout transitions smoother in IE?
[03:09:03] <NodeX> good toi see you minify Html and have a 95 page speed :)
[03:09:15] <NodeX> Blaster .. some context
[03:09:26] <NodeX> maybe slow them down
[03:10:11] <VarunBatra_> NodeX I concentrated on its userinterface and navigation (few tips)
[03:11:26] <Blaster> NodeX:  I'm using fadeIn to put an opaque overlay over the screen but it seems really laggy when it does the animation
[03:11:56] <NodeX> this is what I am developing at the moment VarunBatra_ http://ukjs.nodex.co.uk
[03:12:14] <NodeX> Blaster... try maybe slow it down
[03:20:40] <VarunBatra_> NodeX I did m.naukri.com :)
[03:20:45] <VarunBatra_> You are on linkedin?
[03:20:55] <NodeX> no
[03:21:28] <VarunBatra_> Strange, where you are in professional-internet world?
[03:22:28] <NodeX> I build high performance web apps / CMS systems / CRM's to handle millions of page views per day .. so I tend to get head hiunted!
[03:23:03] <NodeX> it was more to show you the javascript / jquery on the page to give you some ideas!! - it's still in heavy development lol
[03:23:25] <VarunBatra_> When I implemented hash, I had issue finding current page in backend, per say if I am on www.varunbatra.com and open any url, copy paste in different site then it first load core page then it loads page user is on.
[03:23:25] <sente> NodeX: what frameworks/plugins do yo use?
[03:24:12] <VarunBatra_> http://www.varunbatra.com/#/contact-varun-batra.html I am here, then it will load home page than contact page
[03:24:16] <VarunBatra_> Any solution?
[03:24:22] <NodeX> sente : my own open sourced framework
[03:24:46] <VarunBatra_> I think it is on YII isn't it NodeX?
[03:24:55] <NodeX> YII ?
[03:25:10] <VarunBatra_> In backend
[03:25:16] <VarunBatra_> YII is php programming.
[03:25:37] <NodeX> I use a variety of backend languages .. mosty php
[03:25:40] <NodeX> mostly *
[03:25:50] <Bitcrusher> hi people
[03:25:52] <sente> NodeX: cool
[03:26:42] <NodeX> I found every other framework to be bloated and uses about 10-50 times more memory than mine
[03:27:40] <Bitcrusher> I'm starting out with JQ, but am having some difficulties triggering a the .hide on .click when using this guide http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Plugin_Methods
[03:28:04] <NodeX> Bitcrusher : can you pastebin your code ?
[03:29:26] <sente> god damn i need a designer, so badly
[03:30:07] <sente> i have a billion things that would be so awesome if i just had some templates w/ rounded corners and all that shit
[03:30:15] <sente> to populate
[03:30:37] <sente> i'm too married to the command line
[03:30:39] <NodeX> why not just use css3 borders
[03:30:50] <NodeX> border-radius*
[03:31:07] <sente> NodeX: yeah, that'd be fine
[03:31:15] <sente> but that's equally impossible to me, for some reason
[03:31:25] <NodeX> psatebin your code .. I'/ll help you
[03:31:42] <sente> i user the term "rounded corners" metaphorically to mean "a site that doesn't look like sente designed it (doesn't look like shit)"
[03:32:18] <NodeX> oh right lol
[03:32:32] <NodeX> I have the same problem so I get a designer to do the graphics!
[03:33:52] <Bitcrusher> NodeX: I'm actually using that example code from the link, and am trying to make that work - but hold on
[03:34:04] <sente> NodeX: http://c.sente.cc/Zt0f/judges.html
[03:34:23] <sente> I end up just doing it ALL python or whatever and render shit like that
[03:34:26] <sente> it's luuuuulzy
[03:34:29] <sente> but accurate!
[03:35:30] <NodeX> holy sh** that's alot of spans lol
[03:36:03] <sente> well I have a script which converts what I see on the terminal to html
[03:36:07] <sente> and it's fairly stupid
[03:36:39] <chee> ghb
[03:38:01] <sente> check out http://c.sente.cc/6iKo/graph-colors.html
[03:38:04] <Browser> Can i put two selectors join ? For example :input[type=text]|:input[type=hidden]   ?
[03:38:12] <Browser> Something like this.
[03:38:41] <NodeX> :input[type=text],:input[type=hidden]
[03:38:54] <NodeX> | -> ,
[03:39:04] <chee> s/|/,
[03:39:18] <chee> lolo
[03:40:35] <Browser> ':input[type=text],:input[type=hidden]'  don't fix
[03:40:42] <Whirl3d> Cool. I have never heard of Galacia...I hate being so ignorant about the world
[03:41:01] <NodeX> Browser : you mean this or this
[03:41:04] <NodeX> or .. this and this
[03:41:26] <Browser> this or this
[03:41:35] <NodeX> ':input[type=text], :input[type=hidden]'
[03:41:36] <Browser> 		$('form').find(':input[type=text],:input[type=hidden]').each(function() {
[03:41:56] <NodeX> try a space between the ,
[03:42:04] <NodeX> $('form').find(':input[type=text], :input[type=hidden]').each(function() {
[03:42:26] <NodeX> it definately works .. I use it all the time lol
[03:43:52] <Browser> mmm, dont work me
[03:45:24] <NodeX> console.log($('form').find(':input[type=text],:input[type=hidden]'));
[03:49:10] <Browser> perfect, NodeX i had an error sintax after, Thanks you.
[03:59:28] <Bitcrusher> NodeX: Heres my code (finally) - if you still have time: http://pastebin.com/SkyWH00h
[03:59:50] <Bitcrusher> and heres where I'm testing out my code: http://starkiller.qualisoft.dk/test/
[04:03:38] <Bitcrusher> NodeX: I'd like to trigger the function from that code, when clicking a button, but I don't want the whole plugin to be only tied to one #id - I'd like to be able to trigger different parts/functions of it from various buttons/events
[04:06:01] <NodeX> 1 sec
[04:06:32] <NodeX> wrap it
[04:06:40] <Bitcrusher> wrap it?
[04:07:05] <NodeX> http://pastebin.com/igpg4RRQ
[04:07:06] <Bitcrusher> I'd like to point out, that its my first time messing with JQ
[04:07:10] <NodeX> should do the trick
[04:09:02] <NodeX> lcontrol does not exist as a dom node
[04:09:14] <NodeX> $('#loginbutton').click(function() { $(this).logincontrol('loginsubmit'); });
[04:09:38] <NodeX> in that instance $(this) IS $('#loginbutton')
[04:10:50] <Bitcrusher> NodeX: ok, cause I was unsure if I could make my own "object" like that with the methods, instead of tying it to one #id and calling them from another - but I always has to be tied to a dom object?
[04:11:51] <Bitcrusher> NodeX: how about $('#someotherbutton').click(function() { $('#loginbutton').logincontrol('loginsubmit'); }); ?
[04:11:53] <NodeX> no .. but if ti cant find the object it cant apply a method to it
[04:12:07] <NodeX> yes that will work too..
[04:12:38] <NodeX> you can use ... $.logincontrol('method'); too if you like
[04:13:07] <NodeX> that is provided your plugin does not need a dom element ;)
[04:16:46] <Browser> http://pastebin.com/GR8RPcp7  i have this jquery code and in the last page i want to show the variable data. Where should i create a function to show it ?
[04:18:13] <Bitcrusher> NodeX: Now it actually works, so thank you for that :) but how would i make the plugin so it does not require to be tied to a #id or .class? So I can just call the methods directly?
[04:35:56] <NodeX> Bitcrusher : .. $.pluginName('MethodName');
[04:36:16] <NodeX> in your case .. $.logincontrol('loginsubmit');
[04:38:06] <Advocated> hi there, im opening/showing a dialog, which works fine, and then i close it too, but then i try it again, it won't open. It works if i refresh the page, any reason why its limited to showing once?
[04:39:03] <Bitcrusher> NodeX: thanks :)
[04:43:39] <Advocated> hmm, even if i close, then destroy it, and try it again, it still won't open the 2nd time :S
[04:49:55] <domcat> I am doing a slider with draggable and using a grid [142,0] so it snaps to it when I drag, but I also want to see when I move the draggable element and when I drop it it should snap to that grid (like a magnet). how could I achieve that?
[04:56:37] <domcat> any ideas?
[05:24:48] <frimbo> hi! the twitter bootstrap template.html-file links to "bootstrap-alert.js" but there is only "bootstrap.js" in the /js-folder, and "-alert.js" and all the other files are inside bootstrap.js, where can I read more about this way of including js-files?
[06:06:08] <chee> nooooooooooooooo! all my fiddle
[06:06:27] <chee> 20 minutes of fiddling, i accidentally Command+R instead of Ctrl+S
[06:06:48] <chee> it was only 20 minutes, but it was 20 magical minutes
[06:06:58] <chee> and no it's gone
[06:07:04] <chee> i take my life
[06:08:46] <NodeX> ouch
[06:12:10] <beasty> hi guys
[06:12:22] <beasty> i'm having some kind of an issue
[06:12:45] <beasty> i want to get the .css('display'); from a element
[06:13:03] <beasty> but it always give me 'none' even after a .show();
[06:13:06] <beasty> any idea ?
[06:13:21] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[06:13:57] <NodeX> dont forget show is asynch ... if you want the display property AFTER show has finished do this ...
[06:14:21] <beasty> NodeX: http://pastebin.com/GJuKe1pD
[06:14:33] <NodeX> $(element).show(function(){var display = $(this).css('display')});
[06:22:22] <johnthejohn> I'm new to jQuery and I want to do something like this: http://yeyfiles.net/kattmat/fCZLdw.png . It's not supposed to change between the pages automatically, the user should just be able to click between them. How would I accomplish this with jQuery?
[06:24:17] <imanc> hey can anyone recommend a jquery tool tip plugin?
[06:42:25] <Advocated> I'm doing: var position =  $(this).position(); and then: $("#dialog-form").dialog("option", "position", [position.left, position.top]); and then $( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" ); but it fails, if i remove the dialog("option" bit it works.. any ideas please?
[06:43:48] <Haraldson> how does it fail?
[06:43:54] <Haraldson> what does your console say?
[06:44:56] <Advocated> Haraldson, well, it just doesnt load the dialog. if i remove the line it does, no errors in error console strangely enough
[06:45:23] <Advocated> nor in firebug
[06:45:49] <Haraldson> and you're sure all the arguments you provide are valid?
[06:46:04] <Haraldson> the array of positions, e.g?
[06:47:09] <Advocated> ive just alerted those as a test, both give 36 no matter where i do it, but atleast there's something in those
[06:49:20] <Haraldson> strange
[06:50:03] <Advocated> ahh i may know the problem, that bits ok, but i think its callinging my mouseleave event
[06:50:09] <Advocated> *calling lol
[06:52:47] <Advocated> yeah, it was that, fixed
[06:56:26] <Advocated> hmm, i load my dialog fine now, and then i close it, and then destroy it. I hover over my div(to show it again) and it won't show. A reload allows it to work, any reason why I could only do this once? Again, no errors, i've removed the destroy as a test but same problem
[06:59:16] <Advocated> im even doing 	alert("should open");$( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );  and the 2nd time, it alerts, but still won't open the dialog?
[07:02:24] <domcat> how to change width on resize of dynamically created element?
[07:19:45] <last1> I use Fancybox and I have code like this: User Click -> FancyBox1 -> FancyBox2 -> onClosed -> FancyBox1
[07:19:56] <last1> so basically from FancyBox2 it goes back to FancyBox1
[07:20:16] <last1> the problem is that when doing that, the rest of the screen stays out, it doesn't grey out anymore
[07:20:21] <last1> out -> white
[07:20:29] <last1> so I end up with FancyBox1 on a white background
[07:22:40] <Advocated> hmm, i load my dialog fine now, and then i close it, and then destroy it. I hover over my div(to show it again) and it won't show. A reload allows it to work, any reason why I could only do this once? Again, no errors, i've removed the destroy as a test but same problem im even doing  alert("should open");$( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );  and the 2nd time, it alerts, but still won't open the dialog?
[07:29:29] <cuco> i am trying to use jqueryUi.tabs and for some reason the UI tab is not getting loaded (I see a normal ui/li). what can I be missing?

[09:39:04] <devmikey> How do you remove and add an element?
[09:40:56] <Kambfhase> ?remove @ devmikey
[09:40:56] <bot-t> devmikey, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[09:41:10] <Kambfhase> ?add @ devmikey
[09:41:10] <bot-t> devmikey, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[09:41:43] <Kambfhase> meh.  .append() is what i meant.
[09:43:47] <devmikey> If you remove, then add an element, does it force a cache revalidation?
[09:46:41] <Kambfhase> doubt it
[09:47:07] <devmikey> I was hoping to use this to refresh an image
[09:50:30] <Kambfhase> you could try the good old "append random string to ur which has no effect"-trick
[09:50:36] <Kambfhase> *url
[09:50:52] <devmikey> Yeah I know, but that's retarded
[09:51:18] <hobs> also done by like 1000000 websites
[09:51:22] <devmikey> FYI, in opera you can apparently just use http headers and it will revalidate
[09:52:25] <hobs> well good for opera
[09:54:09] <devmikey> hobs: That's less that the number of people who think cows are holy creatures worthy of worship
[09:54:13] <devmikey> so good for them
[09:54:42] <padd173> what's wrong with appending random strings?
[09:54:44] <hobs> good for them as well
[09:55:01] <devmikey> hobs: Both make an equal amount of sense
[09:55:22] <hobs> one is based on the fact that you want that image to load
[09:55:26] <hobs> one is based on cows
[09:55:55] <devmikey> meh, hobs isn't worth 2 shits
[09:56:22] <devmikey> padd173: if I inform the browser not to cache via headers, I shouldn't have to
[09:56:37] <padd173> yes
[09:56:57] <devmikey> And though it's not something I can't get around, I don't think I should have to
[09:58:38] <Kambfhase> welcom to the world of web development!
[09:59:04] <devmikey> padd173: I frequently have horrible problems with IE's "compatibility view", but I'm not gonna go out of my way to make my crap work for it either.
[10:00:20] <padd173> maybe there's a reason standards aren't followed
[10:00:28] <padd173> maybe the standards themselves suck (for some reason)
[10:00:45] <padd173> could be the case. think about it.
[10:00:57] <devmikey> Well it's possible, but in my judgment, they dont
[10:01:11] <padd173> I mean the particular standard
[10:01:21] <devmikey> in any of the cases I'm talking about
[10:03:00] <padd173> I'll go back to reading my algorithms book
[10:03:15] <devmikey> The reality is, browser go against sensible standards to fix a common problem, in my case probably being people too lazy or ignorant to define their http headers in a world with far less bandwidth
[10:03:46] <devmikey> That and the fact that browsers are all harshly judged on speed
[10:05:13] <devmikey> All of which results in browsers which say "You don't want me to cache something?  Well fuck you, go do something stupid"
[10:05:39] <padd173> Ha
[10:06:27] <padd173> We store images as <number>.jpg
[10:06:39] <padd173> when they're edited, their number changes
[10:06:57] <padd173> increments, and gets stored (the number) in the database
[10:07:06] <devmikey> right, I fully understand that workaround
[10:20:03] <alexr2> y
[10:22:35] <chee> y not
[10:26:07] <alexr2> good point
[10:32:21] <Elena-rus> hello
[10:33:43] <Kambfhase> ?hi @ Elena-rus
[10:33:43] <bot-t> Elena-rus, :)
[10:43:31] <Elena-rus> hi, I'm trying to play audio files dynamically using jquery
[10:43:34] <Elena-rus> http://pastebin.com/wyV6B4TP
[10:44:03] <Elena-rus> the src has got to be dynamic, such as setUrl(index + '.mp3')
[10:44:12] <Elena-rus> the index of the a href
[10:44:25] <Elena-rus> not sure how to implement this
[10:45:14] <Elena-rus> so, it has to play 0.mp3 1.mp3 2.mp3 files accordingly
[10:45:54] <alexr2> elena-rus, create an audio element dynamically and play it when you need it
[10:50:08] <Elena-rus> so it's got to be var src = setUrl(index + '.mp3') ?
[10:52:02] <alexr2> var audioElement = document.createElement('audio');  audioElement.setAttribute('src', 'loading.ogg');  audioElement.play();
[10:53:13] <Elena-rus> no, I need various audio files on the page
[10:53:41] <alexr2> make an array... var audioArray = []; audioArray[0] = docume...
[10:53:44] <Elena-rus> every time I click one of the links, a different file should play
[10:54:12] <Elena-rus> I want to bind the name of the file to the index of the link, to make it easier
[10:54:22] <Elena-rus> 'cause there's going to be lots of links on the page
[10:54:36] <Elena-rus> not sure how to make it work
[10:55:13] <alexr2> use a selector for all the links $("a") and do a loop through all of them to add them to the array
[10:55:24] <Elena-rus> to make the name of the file played o.mp3, 1.mp3, 2.mp3 etc.
[10:56:15] <Elena-rus> I guess it would be easier to do something like var src = index + '.mp3'
[10:56:43] <Elena-rus> it's going to automatically set it to 0.mp3, if I click the first link
[10:56:51] <Elena-rus> and so on and so forth
[10:57:55] <alexr2> so you want audio dynamically set depending on what link you click first?
[10:58:21] <Elena-rus> there will be around 50 audios on the page
[10:58:23] <Elena-rus> as many links
[10:58:46] <Elena-rus> depending on the link I click, the audio should be played accordingly
[10:59:05] <alexr2> so the first link on the page should always play 0.mp3?
[10:59:12] <alexr2> or is it the first link you click should play 0.mp3?
[10:59:14] <Elena-rus> how do I set the src to make the name of the audio match the index of the link?
[10:59:43] <Elena-rus> the index of the first link is 0, the src should be set to index + '.mp3'
[11:00:33] <Elena-rus> so it shoulbe 0.mp3 and 1.mp3 and 2.mp3 etc.
[11:07:53] <devmikey> If I call $('#divid').add(<p>Foo.</p>) on a div, would it add that html to the div and if so, where?
[11:10:54] <imsky> lol
[11:10:54] <alexr2> Elena-rus, something like http://jsfiddle.net/rtfJT/1/  Haven't really tested it, but it should work
[11:11:32] <flakox> hi All
[11:11:37] <imsky> hello flakox
[11:12:00] <flakox> I need bind a function when an element is created into dom with not user interaction, just when element get created
[11:12:04] <flakox> how can I do that?
[11:12:30] <flakox> I was thinking about something like delegate load but i know that can't be done
[11:12:57] <alexr2> you can try using "on"
[11:13:13] <alexr2> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:13:13] <flakox> alexr2, No I didn't, but do you think could work?
[11:13:32] <alexr2> It binds functions to elements once they're created
[11:13:41] <flakox> In all browsers, the load event does not bubble. In Internet Explorer 8 and lower, the paste and reset events do not bubble. Such events are not supported for use with delegation, but they can be used when the event handler is directly attached to the element generating the event.
[11:13:49] <flakox> load doens't bubble
[11:14:01] <sorahn> in line 4 here: http://pastebin.com/4qjMN5Y4 shouldn't $(this) be the element that the selector is using?
[11:14:19] <Kambfhase> ?append @ devmikey
[11:14:19] <bot-t> devmikey, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:15:32] <Elena-rus> hey alexr2, thanks!
[11:15:34] <alexr2> sorahn, i've noticed that with functions that aren't native to jquery, the $(this) sometimes refers to the (in this case) popup itself rather than the selector element
[11:15:34] <flakox> any idea=
[11:16:04] <sorahn> alexr2: if I break, I see it as the HTMLDocument itself.
[11:16:15] <sorahn> alexr2: any idea how to fix that?
[11:16:29] <alexr2> jsfiddle.net so I can see what you're talking about
[11:17:41] <sorahn> sec, need to get a cdn hostted copy of bootstrap
[11:19:16] <olinux> i have a php script that processes files and outputs the filenames as they are processed. file1 complete ... file2 complete ... file3 complete ... i'd like to feed this data to an ajax requests that does a live write to screen, how do i do that?
[11:19:24] <Kambfhase> sorahn: closure, you dont understand it.
[11:19:42] <sorahn> Kambfhase: ?
[11:19:52] <sorahn> oh yea, there's a missing ;
[11:20:37] <Kambfhase> the line 4 is executed even before popover() ic alled, that means $(this) refers to what it is at line 0.
[11:21:23] <sorahn> thats what I want it to refer to, but that's not what it actually IS refering to.
[11:21:40] <sorahn> i don't want it to refer to the popover itself, but the element that is triggering the popover.
[11:22:10] <sorahn> alexr2: not jsfiddle, but: http://sorahn.net/bootstrap/
[11:22:54] <sorahn> line 212
[11:23:22] <sorahn> and the element its targeting is line 93
[11:26:56] <Kambfhase> sorahn: try this: http://pastebin.com/x5jqahCL
[11:27:00] <Marcus> Hey does anyone here have experience with tinymce and jquery?
[11:27:20] <alexr2> sorahn, are you sure you're even using popover correctly? i'm getting nothing for it at all
[11:27:31] <Advocated> hmm, i load my dialog fine now, and then i close it, and then destroy it. I hover over my div(to show it again) and it won't show. A reload allows it to work, any reason why I could only do this once? Again, no errors, i've removed the destroy as a test but same problem im even doing  alert("should open");$( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );  and the 2nd time, it alerts, but still won't open the dialog? sorry if this is a repeat, just got cut off
[11:27:56] <Marcus> Is anyone here an expert on TinyMCE and jquery? :-)
[11:28:06] <Marcus> Or at least a struggling noob?
[11:28:51] <alexr2> nm, it's working fine now?
[11:28:56] <sorahn> Kambfhase: that worked!
[11:29:01] <Kambfhase> ?demo @ Advocated
[11:29:01] <bot-t> Advocated, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:29:08] <alexr2> alrighty then :-P
[11:29:28] <Advocated> Kambfhase, ok will do
[11:29:44] <Marcus> So no one is using tinymce with jQuery?
[11:29:51] <Kambfhase> sorahn: :) you might want to read about javascript `this`and scoping ;)
[11:30:36] <Marcus> join #tinymce
[11:30:59] <alexr2> marcus, you should just ask your question :-P
[11:31:24] <sorahn> Kambfhase: when i've done previous things with $('something).function({})  $(this) in side said function works, but i'm not sure what the difference is.
[11:32:23] <Marcus> I use my own obfiscator and gzipper instead of the badly documented one tinymce has. And I'm having problems... I can gzip  and obfiscate the tinymce files and they init() but when I try and load the editor, the plugins can't find the location of their files.
[11:32:53] <Marcus> They all say 4040 not found and show a double // in the path. But when I try and set my own path, tinymce overwrites it. ARGGG!
[11:34:07] <Kambfhase> sorahn: much smarter people than me have swritten articles about scoping in JS. google for it
[11:39:46] <Marcus> Why is no one ever in the TinyMCE forum?
[11:41:18] <tw2113> confession to knowing how TinyMCE works, which no one wants to fess up to?
[11:49:45] <codepal> What's wrong with my Operators !!!! --- http://jsfiddle.net/palhmbs/ShcmM/16/
[11:50:45] <codepal> the slider is supposed to display only 1 article based on the if ( pos === 50 && pos < 285) !!
[11:51:06] <codepal> the function is right down the bottom
[11:53:26] <codepal> thing that throws it is when you slide the bar back from 1TB to 775
[11:53:37] <codepal> it shouldn't be displaying that "third article"
[11:54:04] <olinux> i have a php script that processes files and outputs the filenames as they are processed w/ob_flush/flush for immediate output stream. file1 complete ... file2 complete ... file3 complete ... i'd like to feed this data to an ajax requests that does a live write to an element on screen, how do i do that?
[11:54:05] <eddiemonge> pos === 50 && pos < 285  is pointless since 50 will always be lower than 285
[11:54:26] <olinux> setinterval and repolling the url would start another processing instance whcih i dont want
[11:54:40] <olinux> just the current progress streamed to client
[12:00:41] <eddiemonge> codepal: what should happen when?
[12:01:30] <codepal> eddiemonge, I'm trying to make it so it will only display 1 of 3 div's when between a certain range.
[12:01:38] <codepal> but my logic is off
[12:02:12] <codepal> and mootools Reveal is being buggy, maybe
[12:02:33] <eddiemonge> you do know this is a jquery room right?
[12:02:55] <codepal> ! omg !
[12:02:59] <codepal> sorry....
[12:04:09] <last1> I am dynamically adding a <button> to a page, through .html('<button id="btn1"...>');
[12:04:24] <last1> I'm trying to catch the click event on that dynamic button
[12:04:55] <last1> so I've tried : $("#btn1").on('click', function() {.. });
[12:05:02] <last1> but it doesn't appear to catch it
[12:05:48] <eddiemonge> codepal: like this http://jsfiddle.net/ShcmM/17/ ?
[12:06:41] <eddiemonge> last1: are you adding that event handler after you create the button? if not, you need to use the delegate part of .on() see on
[12:06:48] <eddiemonge> ?on @ last1
[12:06:48] <bot-t> last1, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:07:15] <codepal> eddiemonge, that is much tidier than my version - thank you!
[12:07:23] <Rahul_> any body knows extjs?
[12:07:28] <codepal> I like your use of  { else }
[12:07:47] <last1> eddie: I am adding the button AFTER the page loads
[12:08:01] <Rahul_> codepal do u know about extjs?
[12:08:14] <eddiemonge> Rahul_: i used to know it
[12:08:17] <last1> so the event handler is created at a time when the button does not exist yet
[12:08:40] <codepal> Rahul_, no, sorry
[12:08:41] <Rahul_> eddiemonge which version ?
[12:08:52] <Rahul_> codepal ok no probs :)
[12:10:03] <eddiemonge> last1: on then like i said, you need to use the delegation part on .on()
[12:10:10] <eddiemonge> Rahul_: 3.x
[12:10:59] <Rahul_> eddiemonge cool :) can u explain wat does it do please ?
[12:11:10] <last1> rahul: seriously ?
[12:11:16] <last1> you can't wikipedia to get that information ?
[12:11:47] <last1> eddie: are you talking about doing it like this: $('body').on('click', 'button' ) ?
[12:13:43] <Rahul_> eddiemonge, ok i will do it .. can you give example application idea .. i want build sa that i can brush up all extjs
[12:16:41] <lyrae> say i have  25 miages... rows and columns of 5 each, like a grid. what would be the easiest way to select the first 4 images on each row?  use % operand?
[12:16:57] <chuwiey> hello all, is there a way to make a delayed call to a function for event scroll? (i basically don't want my function to run constantly because someone is scrolling downwards, I only want it to do so every nth scroll units)
[12:17:05] <JesperA> depends on what you want to do with them lyrae
[12:17:15] <Marcus> Ok, this should be an easy one... How do you reset a .one event?
[12:17:17] <lyrae> JesperA: apply a css rule
[12:18:32] <JesperA> lyrae if your rows and colums stay the same amount of images you can just use css
[12:19:06] <lyrae> JesperA: no, they change dynamically as the browser is resized
[12:19:07] <Marcus> $target.one('click',function (e) { if (e.metaKey) { return false; } else { ... } }); So far this doesn't work? Can someone please help me?
[12:20:56] <lyrae> chee: please tell me youre hereeeee. i figured it out
[12:21:17] <lyrae> JesperA: i got it. i apply the css style, then i find the last one in each row and remove them
[12:21:40] <JesperA> lyrae yeah, with :nth-child(N) or whatever
[12:21:47] <chuwiey> anyone?
[12:21:48] <lyrae> Yep
[12:23:01] <eddiemonge> someone?
[12:23:06] <eddiemonge> no one?
[12:23:16] <chuwiey> everyone
[12:23:45] <chee> (:!
[12:25:02] <chuwiey> hello all, is there a way to make a delayed call to a function for event scroll? (i basically don't want my function to run constantly because someone is scrolling downwards, I only want it to do so every nth scroll units)
[12:26:09] <eddiemonge> chuwiey: set a flag
[12:26:27] <eddiemonge> run the function for all scrolls but only keep running if the flag is true
[12:26:56] <eddiemonge> so you can set it to run only x milliseconds or only if the page has gone y pixels
[12:30:34] <chuwiey> eddiemonge: can you point me in the right direction for seeing if i've scrolled y pixels?
[12:32:03] <eddiemonge> look at the scrollPos
[12:32:10] <eddiemonge> ?scroll
[12:32:11] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[12:34:29] <chuwiey> thanks eddiemonge :)
[12:36:20] <JesperA> you´re welcome chuwiey
[12:58:00] <aaairc> if i need to keep track of the number of a certain type of element on the page (there might be anywhere from 1 or 2 to 200)... do you think i would be better to create a var to keep track of it, or to just keep going (".result").length?
[12:58:39] <aaairc> the number of $(".result") elements will be changing dynamically while a user is on the page
[12:59:32] <Advocated> wouldnt it be better to check the length whenever you need it though? may not be the correct way, but its how i'd probably do it
[13:00:04] <joshsmith> jaequery: ping
[13:01:09] <aaairc> Advocated: the only thing i was worried about in repeatedly checking $(".result").length was that perhaps it would be a performance hit for the page. i have no idea how fast those matching queries are.
[13:01:38] <Advocated> aaairc, you may be right, sorry but brb
[13:01:40] <aaairc> I'm going to be checking the number of .result elements multiple times in a for loop that loads the page and is executed each time an ajax action occurs
[13:02:08] <aaairc> Advocated: i'm not saying i'm right or wrong... i just don't know...
[13:03:10] <aaairc> if anyone has any insight on whether i should be concerned about a performance hit from checking $(".result").length (so like 20 times in a row as part of a for loop it would be much appreciated. i have no idea.
[13:06:54] <aaairc> anyone?
[13:09:40] <Eviltwin> You mean you have exactly $(".result").length 20 times?
[13:09:50] <Eviltwin> Or 20 different selectors
[13:10:18] <joshsmith> yeah why would you do $('.result').length within a for loop?
[13:10:45] <joshsmith> if you're do (for var i = 0; i < $('.result').length; i++)
[13:10:49] <joshsmith> then yes, that will be a performance hit
[13:11:03] <joshsmith> you should be caching that sucker
[13:11:06] <Eviltwin> It'' be a performance hit if there are a lot of results or on ancient browsers
[13:11:08] <joshsmith> for()
[13:11:10] <Eviltwin> It'll*
[13:11:24] <Eviltwin> Obviously there are some circumstances where you can't just cache it
[13:11:25] <joshsmith> ideally you should just cache it anyway
[13:11:33] <aaairc> I would effectively have $(".result").length... that exact line 20 times in a loop because i would want to do something once the size of $(".result").length reached a certain size
[13:11:34] <Eviltwin> Where elements with .result might be added throughout the course of the loop
[13:11:48] <Eviltwin> What is that size?
[13:11:50] <aaairc> and each iteration of the loop the number of .result elements would be increasing or decreasing
[13:11:55] <Krambfhase> why don't you use .each() ?
[13:12:01] <joshsmith> it would really help to see some code aaairc
[13:12:09] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ aaairc
[13:12:09] <bot-t> aaairc, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:13:09] <aaairc> ok
[13:15:03] <aaairc> the basic question is still though would executing $(".result").length 20 consecutive times be a performance hit... or is $('.result').length so efficient that the time to execute would be so minuscule that its not worth worrying about unless you did it like a thousand or more consecutive times or if the number of .result elements was over a thousand
[13:15:22] <aaairc> just trust me i need to check on the size of the number of .result elements repeatedly
[13:16:44] <aaairc> joshsmith: sounds like your saying it is a performance hit to do that
[13:17:18] <joshsmith> it depends on the actual length
[13:17:40] <aaairc> Eviltwin: yes .result elements would be added and removed throughout the course of a loop
[13:17:57] <aaairc> joshsmith: the actual length will never exceed 200 or 300
[13:18:12] <aaairc> in most instances it will be between 10 and 50
[13:19:02] <Krambfhase> the loading time of you page will be much bigger than all of the JS on your page
[13:22:28] <aaairc> Krambfhase: so your saying don't worry about it?
[13:22:36] <aaairc> still doing the jsfiddle...
[13:23:02] <Krambfhase> if you have less than a thousand Visitors per month, yes.
[13:25:41] <aaairc> Krambfhase: so if I'm worrying about long term efficiency then, may as well design it now so i keep track of the number of .result elements through a var numOfResults independently, and just increment and decrement that variable each time a .result is added or deleted?
[13:26:39] <Krambfhase> no, that would make you could unstable.
[13:26:52] <Krambfhase> if you ever forget inc/dec things break
[13:27:25] <Krambfhase> just do arr=$('.result'); for(i=0;i<arr.length;i++){ ... }
[13:34:20] <kurol> or $('.result').each()
[13:34:43] <aaairc> here is an example jsfiddle
[13:34:44] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/nzZjT/2/
[13:35:54] <aaairc> kurol: you will see that the number of results need to be checked at each iteration in the loop
[13:36:10] <aaairc> Krambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/nzZjT/2/
[13:37:50] <Krambfhase> ah, no. you should do it the other way round.
[13:38:32] <Krambfhase> or, ... hmmm
[13:39:42] <primeras> hi all. Sorry my English isn't very well. I have a problem.
[13:39:43] <primeras> http://pastebin.com/pMFZvRsj
[13:39:57] <primeras> I'm new jquery coding. that my test code
[13:40:09] <primeras> but fails
[13:40:12] <Krambfhase> I'd create an empty array, stuff all the node in there and then all all of them atonce to #result,
[13:40:23] <primeras> "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null" that error message
[13:40:46] <primeras> where is the my error
[13:41:40] <aaairc> Krambfhase: so not like this? http://jsfiddle.net/f3zYW/3/
[13:42:32] <aaairc> Krambfhase: that won't work with the empty array because each result has an image that i want to load independently, once the image is loaded
[13:42:47] <aaairc> like i don't want to load everything at once... things build out incrementally
[13:43:13] <jrockjiggz> aaairc: what was your original question? i missed it.
[13:43:33] <aaairc> would people generally say this is a better approach:  http://jsfiddle.net/nzZjT/3/   OR   http://jsfiddle.net/f3zYW/3/  ?  look at the way I'm checking on the number of .result elements.
[13:43:48] <aaairc> jrockjiggz: if you compare those two jsfiddles you will see what I'm talking about
[13:44:21] <aaairc> jrockjiggz: I'm trying to figure out how efficient doing something like $(".result").length is
[13:44:33] <pyrak__> hey dudes, i'm having some trouble getting some devious javascript to work
[13:44:44] <pyrak__> i don't know much about browser security, i might just be doing something impossible?
[13:45:01] <jrockjiggz> aaairc: if(numOfResults.. is better
[13:45:06] <pyrak__> so first, i have a bookmarklet that injects an html file into a page by adding a script tag
[13:45:07] <aaairc> jrockjiggz: and whether its a big deal to do $(".result").length to check how many .results elements I have on the page multiple times in short iteration
[13:45:37] <jrockjiggz> if you $(".result") every loop, you are causing the browser to query the dom everytime
[13:45:41] <pyrak__> then that script file hopes to get the html of a page behind a search form
[13:45:52] <aaairc> jrockjiggz: yeah so that is an unneeded performance hit?
[13:45:55] <pyrak__> so it issues a jquery.post to the page behind the search form
[13:45:56] <jrockjiggz> yes
[13:45:57] <Krambfhase> FUCK.
[13:46:08] <pyrak__> but so far whenever i run it, the site /logs me out/
[13:46:22] <Krambfhase> the even bigger performance hit is the refresh you trigger with every appending!
[13:46:32] <pyrak__> so there is something different about issuing this $.post from when i just do the post from my browser, using the form
[13:46:36] <pyrak__> any ideas what tha tmight be?
[13:46:36] <lyrae> is it possible to combine two functions?
[13:46:38] <lyrae> like
[13:46:55] <lyrae> $(window).resize(function() { // do something           but i'd like to 'do something' on resize() and load()
[13:47:18] <jrockjiggz> pyrak: javascript likes to secure itself by not allowing cross-domaion scripting..
[13:47:31] <aaairc> jrockjiggz: ok cool. i'll do it that way. i just wasn't sure if doing that dom check was such a minuscule performance hit that i shouldn't worry about
[13:47:50] <Krambfhase> lyrae: var doSomething = function(){ /* do something*/ } $(window).resize(doSimthing).load(doSomething);
[13:48:01] <pyrak__> jrockjiggz: but it's not cross-site. the user is on a page on that same domain
[13:48:03] <pyrak__> right?
[13:48:14] <lyrae> Krambfhase: thanks.
[13:49:19] <primeras> heyy please help
[13:49:25] <primeras> http://pastebin.com/pMFZvRsj
[13:49:27] <jrockjiggz> Krambfhase: $(window).trigger('resize') inside load ?
[13:49:30] <primeras> that my code not working
[13:49:31] <primeras> :(
[13:49:54] <jrockjiggz> pyrak__: a little longshot, can you try and remove any 'http://www.domain.com/..'
[13:49:58] <lyrae> Krambfhase: didn't work =|
[13:50:09] <aaairc> Krambfhase: the appending thing i'm not worried about. i'm doing it a little differently that how i showed in the example... but the way that is working creates a cool animation on my page, and was designed that way intentionally
[13:50:17] <Krambfhase> jrockjiggz: yeah, but binding to .resize() is a bad idea anyways.
[13:50:26] <Krambfhase> lyrae: try jrockjiggz answer
[13:52:51] <black_warlock> hi peeps
[13:53:01] <black_warlock> can sombody take a look here
[13:53:18] <black_warlock> i have to make a check box selection
[13:53:34] <pyrak__> jrockjiggz: thanks for the tip. that may have helped. need to poke around a bit more. problem may be elsewhere.
[13:53:36] <black_warlock> and compile an input field , and remove value if deselected
[13:53:43] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/WFTVP/34/
[13:54:18] <jrockjiggz> pyrak__: I had a similar issue and that helped me, but your situation could be completely different
[14:11:53] <black_warlock> halp
[14:11:55] <black_warlock> =(
[14:11:59] <black_warlock> im almost there
[14:12:05] <black_warlock> something its wrong
[14:12:07] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/WFTVP/41/
[14:12:33] <black_warlock> it adds value but doesnt remove it
[14:16:07] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: How's this: http://jsfiddle.net/WFTVP/43/
[14:17:01] <Eviltwin> Or were you particular about the order
[14:17:12] <jrockjiggz> black_warlock: almost working... http://jsfiddle.net/WFTVP/45/
[14:20:28] <jrockjiggz> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/WFTVP/49/   same idea as Eviltwin
[14:20:59] <tw2113> i am trying to append data to a variable in a for() loop, and the very start keeps having 'undefined' and I can't figure out how to remove that part.
[14:21:10] <tw2113> this has my code http://jsfiddle.net/tZDXb/
[14:21:48] <eddiemonge> jrockjiggz: no need for so much jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/WFTVP/54/
[14:22:07] <Eviltwin> tw2113: http://jsfiddle.net/tZDXb/2/
[14:22:37] <BinaryKitten> black_warlock still about?
[14:23:35] <Eviltwin> ?eval var x; x + "User: foo";
[14:23:37] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "undefinedUser: foo"
[14:23:47] <Eviltwin> ?eval var x = ""; x + "User: foo";
[14:23:49] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "User: foo"
[14:24:18] <tw2113> trying to see what you changed Eviltwin
[14:24:41] <jrockjiggz> eddiemonge: what is different, looks liek the same jquery?
[14:24:42] <Eviltwin> tw2113: I just hinted at it with those two evals
[14:24:51] <jrockjiggz> oh nm
[14:25:56] <black_warlock> wow it works
[14:25:59] <black_warlock> i dont get it
[14:26:02] <BinaryKitten> black_warlock is it important the order?
[14:26:11] <black_warlock> not really
[14:26:16] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge, jrockjiggz: Also, $('.imma').each(function() { ... }) instead of $.each($('.imma:checkbox'), function(i) { ... })
[14:26:19] <black_warlock> i have setted the separator for this
[14:26:30] <tw2113> ah, i see what you did. you did var html5 = ""; and i just had var html5
[14:26:34] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: Look at mine http://jsfiddle.net/WFTVP/43/
[14:26:35] * BinaryKitten prefers http://jsfiddle.net/WFTVP/59/
[14:26:40] <black_warlock> theimportant thing is that there arent duplicates
[14:26:41] <tw2113> makes sense now, setting it to empty string
[14:26:51] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: i think $.each is faster than $(s).each
[14:26:54] <tw2113> thanks
[14:27:00] <Eviltwin> tw2113: Otherwise it's effectively undefined + "User" the first itme
[14:27:07] <tw2113> got it
[14:27:14] <BinaryKitten> eddiemonge on which type?
[14:27:28] <eddiemonge> type of what?
[14:27:34] <BinaryKitten> what's  "s" ?
[14:27:44] <eddiemonge> a selector
[14:27:46] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: It's one function call faster but if you're actually looking for speed, you need to ditch .each/.map entirely
[14:27:58] <Eviltwin> Go to for/while
[14:28:02] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: well yeah, a for loop would be far faster
[14:28:04] <black_warlock> what separator shall i use split easly there
[14:28:26] <black_warlock> instead of '000'
[14:28:38] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: The reason $.fn.each exists is for exactly this reason
[14:30:16] <eddiemonge> what reason?
[14:30:26] <Eviltwin> Applying .each to a jQuery collection
[14:30:48] <lyrae> is there a way to combine css for the same element? $('.img').css('margin-bottom',  '3px'), $('.img').css('border',  '3px solid red')     a shortcut for that
[14:31:09] <eddiemonge> ?css @ lyrae
[14:31:09] <bot-t> lyrae, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[14:31:23] <Eviltwin> lyrae: It takes an object
[14:32:15] <BinaryKitten> lyrae yes..
[14:32:24] <Eviltwin> Also it chains
[14:32:30] <lyrae> holdon reading the docs
[14:32:34] <Eviltwin> So you've basically chosen the worst possible way to do that
[14:32:38] <BinaryKitten> as Eviltwin just said an object ... eg .css({key:value, key:value});
[14:32:54] <Eviltwin> $('.img').css('margin-bottom',  '3px').css('border',  '3px solid red') would at least be a step up
[14:33:57] <Eviltwin> But again, object
[14:34:39] <lyrae> alright let me try
[14:36:51] <pyrak__> new question: i'd like to send the user to a new url by POST, with some post data
[14:36:59] <pyrak__> one thing i could do is construct an html form and hit submit on it
[14:37:07] <pyrak__> but is there a simpler way?
[14:37:16] <Eviltwin> pyrak__: I believe that is the only way
[14:37:35] <pyrak__> there must be someone else who has already built a utility function for this?
[14:37:42] <Eviltwin> Probably
[14:37:53] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery redirect post @ pyrak__
[14:37:54] <bot-t> pyrak__, How can I do a form POST w/ a location redirect? - jQuery Forum - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-can-i-do-a-form-post-w-a-location-redirect
[14:38:05] <lyrae> thank you all
[14:38:44] <eddiemonge> pyrak__: thats how you do it
[14:39:14] <eddiemonge> you could redirect with a GET using window.location but for a post, you need to submit the form
[14:47:53] <jrockjiggz> pyrak__: you could construct your data into an object, and then POST with:   post+&'+serialize(dataObj)
[14:48:34] <pyrak__> jrockjiggz: you're suggesting appending that string to the form method?
[14:49:12] <pyrak__> also, i think if i put the POST data in the URL I'll come up against the URL length ceiling
[14:49:25] <eddiemonge> jrockjiggz: and send it as a GET?
[14:49:29] <eddiemonge> or post how?
[14:50:49] <DerekPioneer> what am i doing wrong here?
[14:50:50] <DerekPioneer> url += '&setAttr.inside_text_1={x='+x'&y='+y'}';
[14:50:57] <DerekPioneer> x and y are javascript variables
[14:51:58] <eddiemonge> you are missing some +
[14:52:10] <DerekPioneer> nvm i am stupid
[14:52:20] <eddiemonge> url += '&setAttr.inside_text_1={x=' + x + '&y=' + y + '}';
[14:52:26] <eddiemonge> whitespace is your friend
[15:00:24] <jrockjiggz> i'm comparing $.each   vs   $(el).each();     but i can't seem to really tell the difference.. http://jsfiddle.net/8An7Z/
[15:00:35] <jrockjiggz> see your console.
[15:01:36] <eddiemonge> those arent the most optimal test case to compare them
[15:01:44] <black_warlock> im using a nice script to make image thumbs
[15:01:54] <black_warlock> but its slow
[15:02:15] <eddiemonge> jrockjiggz: look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ and http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:02:29] <jrockjiggz> oops http://jsfiddle.net/8An7Z/1/
[15:02:34] <jrockjiggz> yes there is a difference
[15:03:23] <jrockjiggz> $.each( $('input') is faster
[15:04:35] <ajpiano> and pointlesser
[15:06:17] <eddiemonge> anyone using linkinus? i cant figure out how to search for a channel
[15:07:00] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: you mean /list or something else?
[15:07:22] <sorahn> If i'm using a function that creates an element, how can i target the created element from within that function.  Example: https://gist.github.com/1740978  each element will get a popover made, I want to add a mouseleave event to the created popover.
[15:07:46] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: i forgot what client, maybe colloquy had a nice channel search that would search names/topics
[15:08:03] <ajpiano> i know of nothinhg like that in linkinus
[15:08:27] <eddiemonge> yeah a listing of 11k channels is pointlesser
[15:09:10] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:09:48] <ajpiano> sorahn: unfortunately that question is inextricably coupled to how the popover plugin you're using works
[15:09:54] <ajpiano> so it's hard to give a definitive answer
[15:10:48] <eddiemonge> sorahn: im pretty sure your .each is not needed as well
[15:10:56] <eddiemonge> unless thats a really badly written plugin
[15:11:12] <sorahn> eddiemonge: well, I can't get the content of the selector otherwise...
[15:11:28] <eddiemonge> yes you can, same way you are now
[15:11:44] <sorahn> no, if i don't have the each, then $(this) is the html document itself
[15:11:46] <sorahn> i tried it.
[15:11:53] <eddiemonge> unless like i said, the popover function is complete garbage
[15:11:57] <sorahn> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/js/bootstrap-tooltip.js
[15:12:15] <eddiemonge> oh i see what you are saying
[15:12:16] <sorahn> popover is just an extension of tooltip
[15:12:39] <eddiemonge> the twitter bootstrap? yeah its garbage
[15:12:49] <sorahn> ajpiano: looking through that bit of code, is it maybe easier to explain how I could target the popover?
[15:12:52] <sorahn> eddiemonge: why?
[15:13:12] <ajpiano> sorahn: it looks like you can get a reference to it by plucking it out of .data
[15:13:16] <eddiemonge> i am not impressed by any of twitters bootstrap plugins so far
[15:13:19] <ajpiano> $(this).data("popover").$tip
[15:13:59] <BartjeNL> hi all
[15:14:08] <sorahn> ajpiano: so, would it be $(this).data("popover").mouseleave({ ... }) ?
[15:14:15] <ajpiano> no
[15:14:25] <ajpiano> $(this).data("popover").$tip.mouseleave(fn)
[15:14:31] <BartjeNL> can someone tell me if this is valid?
[15:14:32] <BartjeNL> http://pastebin.com/nxVi6Gu9
[15:14:51] <eddiemonge> valid what?
[15:14:58] <ajpiano> sorahn: bear in mind this is Not Something I've Tried™
[15:15:00] <chee> eddiemonge: the website for LInkinus mentions 'the searchable Channel List'. http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus - so it must be about there somewhere :3
[15:15:17] <eddiemonge> chee: ive found their website often lies
[15:15:26] <eddiemonge> and they often remove features
[15:15:52] <ajpiano> they have an irc channel if you want to complain to them :p
[15:15:55] <chee> probably due to their conceitedness
[15:16:11] <ajpiano> lol well played
[15:16:23] <black_warlock> i have $('#contenitore').css('display', 'inline-block') how can i let it fade in slowly ?
[15:16:37] <ajpiano> you can't fade in a display change like that
[15:17:22] <black_warlock> do i have just to replace .css with .FadeIn ?
[15:17:29] <black_warlock> lemme try
[15:17:33] <sorahn> ajpiano: didn't work quite like that.  I'm investigating
[15:17:37] <chee> but then it will be display:block, won't it?
[15:17:44] <ajpiano> assuming the element was display:inline-block; to begin with
[15:17:58] <ajpiano> black_warlock: sorahn juery should "remember" the original state and use that
[15:18:10] <ravenzz> ..
[15:18:13] <chee> ah
[15:18:22] <chee> ravenzz: ..
[15:19:03] <chee> ajpiano: is it if it is 'display: inline-block; opacity: 0;' ?
[15:19:19] <ravenzz> you could fade to a very low value eg 0.001 and the change its width/height
[15:19:22] <ajpiano> yeah then fadeIn should work or so should fadeTo
[15:19:23] <ravenzz> to 0
[15:19:32] <sorahn> ajpiano: maybe I put it in the wrong spot.  Can you give me an example for where that would go?
[15:20:51] <ajpiano> anywhere after you instantiate the tooltip, i guess
[15:20:59] <ajpiano> if you put together a fiddle i'll take a quick look
[15:21:12] <eddiemonge> oh there is a search. you have to let the channel list show all the channels before it becomes available
[15:21:56] <chee> gross
[15:21:57] <sorahn> ajpiano: I don't have a fiddle, but a test site.
[15:21:58] <black_warlock> doesnt work
[15:22:09] <black_warlock> fadin slow doesnt work HEOLUS !
[15:22:10] <sorahn> ajpiano: http://sorahn.net/bootstrap/  source line 248
[15:22:17] <ajpiano> sorahn: my inclination to start futzing around with a ui library i've never touched
[15:22:25] <ajpiano> is less than "there" per se
[15:22:26] <ajpiano> but we'll see
[15:22:48] <chee> BarryCarlyon: did you try setting '#contenitor { display: inline-block; opacity:0}' in your css?
[15:23:11] <BarryCarlyon> keh?
[15:23:15] <ajpiano> jeez sorahn
[15:23:15] <sorahn> ajpiano: If you can't no worries This is all just futzing as you said.  Once I get back to work on monday with people who actually know javascript, i'm sure I can get it figured out.
[15:23:15] <chee> oops
[15:23:20] <ajpiano> twice i said
[15:23:21] <chee> BarryCarlyon: sorry, Barry
[15:23:24] <sorahn> ?
[15:23:28] * BarryCarlyon goes back to sleep
[15:23:29] <ajpiano> $(this).data("popover").$tip.mouseleave(fn)
[15:23:31] <ajpiano> etc etc.
[15:23:35] <ajpiano> but you didn't do that :/
[15:23:41] <chee> black_warlock: did you try setting '#contenitore { display: inline-block; opacity:0}' in your css?
[15:23:45] <sorahn> Yea, I treid that too
[15:23:52] <sorahn> i got a reference undefined error
[15:23:54] <sorahn> here i'll put it back in
[15:24:23] <sorahn> there.  "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'mouseleave'"
[15:24:47] <ajpiano> oh hm
[15:25:23] <sorahn> sorry for not having a fiddle, I don' have the links to all the cdn bootstrap hosted content.
[15:26:06] <black_warlock> chee: nope
[15:26:29] <ajpiano> sorahn: it's ok
[15:26:53] <ajpiano> sorahn: i can't dig it up right now, by cursorily glancing at the code i thought it stored a reference to the $tip on the popover instance but like
[15:27:02] <ajpiano> it was a *very* cursory glance and an obviously incorrect one
[15:27:19] <sorahn> like i said, no worries.
[15:27:51] <chee> Sargun_Screen: http://jsfiddle.net/W5grm/
[15:27:54] <chee> ffs
[15:27:55] <sorahn> our desktop site uses YUI so i'm basically trying to emulate all our functionality jQuery/ whatever the bootstrap plugins for it to with the least ammount of work.
[15:27:57] <eddiemonge> sorahn: is there a reason you cant change it to the previous call?
[15:27:57] <chee> sorahn: http://jsfiddle.net/W5grm/
[15:28:00] <chee> here is a fiddle for you!
[15:28:09] <ajpiano> sorahn: oh i see
[15:28:37] <sorahn> eddiemonge: ?
[15:28:39] <imanc> hey I have an object ….     data.filtered_fields.xxx      the xxx I only know at runtime.  Is there a way to access the xxx field?  Do I need to delve into the murky world of eval(), r is there something cleaner?
[15:28:40] <black_warlock> opacity:0 wont work terrible effect the div is there but invisible ...it stretch da page terribly
[15:28:49] <ajpiano> sorahn: it doesn't create the $tip until the first time the tip is shown
[15:29:02] <sorahn> oh.
[15:29:03] <sorahn> hmm
[15:29:12] <ajpiano> sorahn: $(this).popover("tip").data("popover").$tip.mouseleave(fn) will work
[15:29:14] * tw2113 is triumphant over javascript for the time being
[15:29:15] <ajpiano> well, *should* work
[15:29:24] <ajpiano> but might not work at all like you're hoping it would :p
[15:29:45] <ajpiano> sorahn: how are you trying to futz with this?
[15:30:15] <sorahn> ajpiano: basically I want the popover to stay around till you leave it's box
[15:30:31] <sorahn> i'm trying to recreate this functionality: http://host.sonspring.com/hoverbox/
[15:30:32] <imanc> var x = "resolution";      data.x ??
[15:31:07] <chee> black_warlock: ok, you don't want the space retained while it's hidden?
[15:31:09] <ajpiano> sorahn: how does it work now? i'm unfamiliar
[15:31:10] <chee> black_warlock: try this then
[15:31:19] <sorahn> that example is just CSS.
[15:31:28] <chee> black_warlock: <div>I LIKE <p style="display:none">HOW YOU LOOK IN</p> SHORT SHORTS</div>
[15:31:31] <eddiemonge> imanc: data[x]
[15:31:54] <imanc> thanks eddiemonge.
[15:32:06] <tw2113> btw, evening everyone
[15:32:06] <chee> black_warlock: and in the CSS, 'p {display:inline-block;}'
[15:32:07] <sorahn> ajpiano: the popover by default only stays around while you're hovering the target of the popover, not the popover itself.  And it's usually off to one side.  I adjusted it to be centered on the target
[15:32:11] <sorahn> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers
[15:32:18] <sorahn> see also the tooltips (right above)
[15:32:28] <chee> black_warlock: then:   $('p').fadeIn();
[15:33:09] <ajpiano> sorahn: well that sounds significantly more complicated than i can get into now
[15:33:23] <sorahn> haha.  like i said, no worries.
[15:33:49] <sorahn> chee: thank you for the fiddle. :)
[15:35:13] <chee> black_warlock: here=> http://jsfiddle.net/2Fyph/
[15:35:28] <tw2113> how's ajpiano ?
[15:35:39] <ajpiano> wat
[15:35:48] <tw2113> how are you
[15:35:49] <chee> wat
[15:36:04] <ajpiano> i'm aight
[15:36:07] <chee> tw2113: evening
[15:36:18] <tw2113> allo
[15:36:53] <chee> so i got these cigarettes that have a picture of a power button on them, and when you press the button with your nail the cigarette turns into a menthol
[15:36:59] <chee> wat
[15:37:23] <ravenzz> black_warlock here you go http://jsfiddle.net/gPsBp/
[15:46:37] <snuggs> love to hear someones opinion on this.  Do you think since some of twitters bootstrap features aren't supported in in ie7-ie8 that it is too soon to use it in projects?
[15:46:47] <imsky> snuggs: no
[15:46:49] <tw2113> no
[15:46:57] <tw2113> perfect time to ditch support for those browsers
[15:47:05] <snuggs> tell that to the client
[15:47:13] <snuggs> or internal users
[15:47:15] <imsky> though ie8 is the most popular browser, ie7 is only 6% of the market
[15:47:21] <imsky> and bootstrap is ie7+, not ie8+
[15:47:29] <tw2113> or polyfill them
[15:47:37] <tw2113> or just craft different experiences for those users
[15:47:39] <snuggs> ie8 doesn't support nth-child
[15:47:45] <imsky> let me check bootstrap in ie7
[15:47:59] <tw2113> selectivizr would help
[15:48:00] <imsky> lol so you just want zebra striping?
[15:48:03] <snuggs> ive been checking it in browserstack
[15:48:19] <snuggs> its not super important
[15:48:26] <snuggs> but it puts up a red flag for me
[15:48:30] <imsky> oof
[15:48:33] <tw2113> i don't see why
[15:48:37] <imsky> rounded corners and gradients are a must
[15:48:39] <tw2113> but that's me
[15:48:43] <sorahn> man you guys are lucky I still have to support ie6 :(
[15:49:04] <imsky> lol
[15:49:04] <snuggs> you use png fix or throw them out entirely?
[15:49:05] <tw2113> get a new job :P
[15:49:16] <sorahn> nah
[15:49:17] <snuggs> tw2113: true that
[15:49:18] <imsky> it doesn't look too bad, snuggs
[15:49:22] <imsky> but it does look degraded
[15:49:33] <sorahn> we still make > $1M per year on IE6 so...
[15:49:34] <imsky> like windows xp to windows 7
[15:49:44] <tw2113> bbl
[15:49:46] <sorahn> er, ie6 users.
[15:50:02] <imsky> wtf bootstrap 2 has buttons now with icons
[15:50:05] <imsky> oh lawd
[15:50:17] <snuggs> yeah man
[15:50:21] <imsky> fast forward to 2013: everything looks like bootstrap
[15:50:25] <snuggs> bootstrap 2 is looking amazing
[15:50:39] <sorahn> the use of the i tag is genius
[15:51:00] <sorahn> but I don't like that despite being in the i tag, they still use the 'icon-' prefix :\
[15:51:08] <snuggs> who the hell is using ie6 still?
[15:51:17] <sorahn> snuggs: people that watch porn
[15:51:19] <imsky> i think that's a habit i have too..
[15:51:19] <sorahn> at work
[15:51:23] <sorahn> for large corporations
[15:51:29] <imsky> optimizing for ie6 from the start
[15:51:44] <snuggs> optimize isn't even a word in ie6's dictionary
[15:51:51] <imsky> bootstrap is gonna put a lot of mediocre ui designers out of business
[15:52:00] <snuggs> imsky: i agree
[15:52:19] <imsky> man...
[15:52:22] <snuggs> the responive layout part is gonna kill them
[15:52:31] <sorahn> snuggs: ie6 doesn't even have a dictionary :P
[15:53:21] <snuggs> sorahn: feel for you man
[15:53:44] <sorahn> at least recently i've spent all my tiem on mobile
[15:53:55] <sorahn> so, i just have to deal with android, instead of IE6.
[15:54:06] <sorahn> which from my experience so far is worse :(
[15:54:32] <imsky> yep
[15:54:37] <imsky> android is some bogus shit
[15:54:44] <snuggs> the worst part in my eyes unless someone can help me with this is ios's eye-retina with the double resolution
[15:54:57] <sorahn> at least ie6 was consistently broken the same way.
[15:55:33] <sorahn> andriod is more fragmented than a 10k piece puzzle.
[15:55:49] <ravenzz> do we need boostrap? seriously.
[15:55:53] <snuggs> its just java i mean common...
[15:56:00] <ravenzz> the i thing sucks imo
[15:56:25] <sorahn> ravenzz: why?
[15:56:26] <snuggs> ravenzz: its a quick fix
[15:56:48] <snuggs> i still contemplate taking the easy way out with 960
[15:57:03] <ravenzz> because it is merely presentational
[15:57:08] <imsky> if only they could fix irc so i wouldn't get klined every 5 minutes
[15:57:16] <snuggs> of the past 40 projects I think I used 960 maybe twice because I had to
[15:57:26] <snuggs> and felt guilt those 2 times
[15:57:30] <imsky> snuggs: http://www.valuative.com/
[15:57:33] <imsky> then again there's this
[15:57:45] <sorahn> snuggs: i actually wish bootstrap was 960 instead of 940, but thankfully they make it easy to customize.
[15:57:50] <snuggs> yeah its on www.builtwithbootstrap.com
[15:57:56] <imsky> snuggs: that's where i got it from
[15:58:02] <imsky> speaking of mediocre designers lol
[15:58:10] <snuggs> true story
[15:58:32] * sorahn outs.
[15:58:33] * abjorn wiggles
[15:58:42] * imsky wiggles for justice
[15:58:43] <snuggs> imsky: they really thought outside the box on that one
[15:58:47] <imsky> lol
[15:58:50] <imsky> bootstrap 1.4 bro
[15:58:58] <imsky> the latest one in my backups is 1.3.6 :\
[15:59:09] <imsky> time for an upgrade to this fancy twitter thing
[15:59:18] <abjorn> l,ololololmol
[15:59:24] <snuggs> they are on 2 now
[15:59:27] <imsky> inoman
[15:59:31] <imsky> i heard the news
[15:59:39] <imsky> you know how old 1.3.6 is?
[15:59:39] <abjorn> already?
[15:59:41] <imsky> 4 months
[15:59:48] <imsky> BREAKNECK SPEED
[15:59:55] <abjorn> if they were versioning any faster they'd be Google
[16:00:05] <imsky> Chrome 29, faster than last week's 28.9
[16:00:24] <snuggs> I hate how they update so fast
[16:00:42] <snuggs> all the developer plugins I use are never compatible
[16:00:48] <imsky> bootstrap + wordpress + jquery is going to be the new killing it
[16:00:54] <chee> abjorn: coldhead and i were enjoying this last night and he told me to show you because you would enjoy it: http://www.prgjobs.com/Job.cfm/445820
[16:00:59] <imsky> if you don't know the above, don't bother making websights
[16:01:04] <imsky> sights of the webs
[16:01:17] <snuggs> does wordpress use bootstrap for the admin?
[16:01:19] <abjorn> lol
[16:01:21] <abjorn> dat coldhead
[16:01:21] <imsky> naw
[16:01:45] <abjorn> wordpress?
[16:01:46] <abjorn> ugh
[16:01:53] <imsky> lol
[16:01:55] <abjorn> I used to love WordPress
[16:01:59] <abjorn> then I worked for a web hosting company
[16:02:03] <imsky> ugh is right, something like 50% of the sites run goddamn wordpress
[16:02:10] <abjorn> where every single hacked/compromised account was because of Wordpress
[16:02:33] <chee> abjorn: then we wrote a fantastic cover letter and resume and i applied for it for the lolbol and we cried laughing
[16:02:39] <abjorn> and where the most bizarre, unfixable, unreplicatable bugs would happen.
[16:02:44] <abjorn> lol chee
[16:02:53] <imsky> "WordPress is used by 53.9% of all the websites whose content management system we know. This is 15.7% of all websites."
[16:02:59] <imsky> 54% kids
[16:03:06] <snuggs> majority of that was dos attacks and sql injections
[16:03:07] <chee> wow
[16:03:07] <imsky> i see the same thing happening for bootstraps
[16:03:30] <snuggs> you can get by that with sanitizing
[16:03:42] <chee> i am already sick to the stomach of little black bars at the tops of web pages
[16:03:49] <abjorn> ^
[16:03:50] <abjorn> me too
[16:03:55] <imsky> chee: get ready for that to be the standard
[16:03:59] <abjorn> I'd use bootstrap, just without that
[16:04:04] <rue> imsky: 8.46%, kids
[16:04:05] <abjorn> I mean, I don't *have* to use that with bootstrap...
[16:04:07] <snuggs> chee: i think you need to get used to it
[16:04:07] <imsky> you can use it without that, abjorn
[16:04:12] <snuggs> at least for 2012
[16:04:12] <abjorn> I know
[16:04:14] <imsky> rue: don't be multiplying
[16:04:15] <abjorn> I was just saying
[16:04:17] <abjorn> you don't

[16:10:02] <abjorn> they're like
[16:10:05] <abjorn> "fuck that guy"
[16:10:08] <imsky> lol
[16:10:08] <chee> loool
[16:10:19] <abjorn> I wouldn't bother with 0.7 if i were you, i dont see the point in portable release for unstable version
[16:10:22] <imsky> i'll wait until 0.6.11
[16:10:28] <imsky> and then port once again
[16:10:39] <imsky> which, judging by the current rates, will be tuesday
[16:10:51] <chee> imsky: 0.6.11's release date is
[16:10:57] <imsky> ?
[16:11:07] <snuggs> anyone going to sxsw
[16:11:11] <chee> "1 week from release of portable 0.6.10 by imsky -- fuck that guy"

[16:14:03] <imsky> it's still from built with boostrap
[16:14:15] <snuggs> super lightweight too
[16:14:17] <imsky> abjorn: when you put memes in the real world, they look completely bizzarre
[16:14:24] <chee> ever since i read it i am not responding
[16:14:44] <abjorn> imsky: that is so stupid
[16:14:51] <imsky> it really is
[16:14:54] <abjorn> we have a meeting room at work, that's just a big gladd room
[16:14:54] <imsky> you should fear for your generation
[16:15:00] <abjorn> and a few poeple put up nyan cat
[16:15:03] <abjorn> in sticky notes
[16:15:05] <abjorn> on it
[16:15:09] <imsky> 20 years from now, nyan cat will be like frank sinatra
[16:15:16] <chee> lololo
[16:15:25] <imsky> the cultural reference point
[16:16:26] <imsky> whatever the merits of bootstrap

[16:16:44] <imsky> :[
[16:16:53] <imsky> i think back to mcluhan
[16:16:58] <chee> that silence was people trying to process that what you just said about nyan cat being frank sinatra is the truth
[16:17:21] <imsky> nyan cat on sticky notes = complete loss of fidelity. it's like carving a song out of cheese
[16:17:28] * chee se
[16:17:30] <imsky> chee: lol everyone thinks it i'm sure
[16:17:50] <imsky> minecraft, forever alone face, trollface, nyan cat
[16:17:56] <imsky> rage comics
[16:18:11] <imsky> i remember when saying "w00t" was like huge geek bonus points
[16:18:18] <chee> HAHAHA
[16:18:20] <imsky> that's so ridiculously tame now
[16:18:50] <chee> i remember the first time i heard somebody say 'w00t' out loud, i could hear the zeroes
[16:18:55] <imsky> yeah
[16:18:59] <imsky> ever say lol out loud?
[16:19:04] <chee> imsky: yes
[16:19:07] <imsky> it's like nyan cat out of sticky notes
[16:19:13] <imsky> doesn't belong in the real world
[16:19:22] <chee> the first time i had no idea what had just happened
[16:19:34] <chee> i had to go and sit down
[16:19:38] <imsky> lol
[16:19:41] <imsky> momentous occasion
[16:20:06] <chee> i remember when i first heard 'less than three' out loud, and i learnt what it feels like to have a red haired step child
[16:20:12] <imsky> ^ that
[16:20:19] <imsky> i can never bring myself to even think of it like that
[16:20:23] <imsky> to me it's always "ascii heart"
[16:20:37] <chee> i'd never wanted to put someone's teeth in their stomach through their throat before
[16:20:52] <imsky> when 16 year old chicks say "i less than three you" it's like everything the internet worked for 10 years ago was in vain
[16:20:55] <imsky> BUT
[16:21:00] <imsky> let us check reddit right now
[16:21:07] <imsky> top 3 posts
[16:21:08] <chee> imsky: it's like .. <3 is not less that three
[16:21:11] <chee> it has its own noise
[16:21:14] <imsky> "the fifties were a simpler time"
[16:21:16] <chee> like 'hrrt'
[16:21:20] <imsky> "greatest costume goes to"
[16:21:34] <chee> but it's like a noise you feel. not a real noise
[16:21:35] <imsky> "i was told alcohol weaks glass by a salesman. what's the most ridic thing a salesman told you?"
[16:21:40] <imsky> chee: i know that feel bro
[16:21:56] <chee> i'm going to start saying "colon close-paren" out loud instead of smiling
[16:21:58] <imsky> so costumes, pining for a time nobody on reddit ever lived in, and getting back at salesmen
[16:22:01] <imsky> ^ 99% of reddit
[16:22:38] <chee> i tried to get into reddit. i don't seem to be the target market
[16:22:43] <imsky> you're not
[16:23:17] <imsky> target market requirements: [ ] dead-end job/no job   [ ] no self-awareness   [ ] intense interest in trivia
[16:23:31] <imsky> and bonus.. [  ] militant smug atheism
[16:23:46] <chee> oh dear
[16:23:55] <imsky> yeah
[16:24:12] <chee> lol militant atheism is one of the most lolious things in the world
[16:24:16] <imsky> it really is
[16:24:20] <abjorn> asdfasdfasdf
[16:24:26] <imsky> trolling atheists > trolling believers any day of the week
[16:24:33] <abjorn> lol
[16:24:40] <chee> abjorn: aeoiaeoiaeoi
[16:24:43] <imsky> believers at some point give up
[16:24:50] <chee> i am pretending to use dvorak
[16:25:29] <chee> newspapers have started trolling athiests, by calling it New Atheism

[16:26:13] <imsky> dawkins = cultural christian

[16:27:32] <chee> my favourite description of the gentleman was from somebody in an irc channel
[16:27:54] <chee> who said "Dawkins is very intelligent, but incredibly impolite"
[16:28:14] <chee> are we still talking about jQuery

[17:12:34] <hexacode> is there a simple call in jquery equivalent to php's file_get_contents ?  i want it to hide all the ajax requests and make it as simple as returning a value from a call to a file on a server
[17:12:58] <imsky> hexacode: no
[17:13:01] <StevenCodes22> imsky: Seriously, calm down
[17:13:04] <hexacode> such asvar string =  jQuery.file_get_contents
[17:13:21] <StevenCodes22> hexacode:  use json
[17:13:28] * imsky moans
[17:15:30] <hexacode> the file is a json file StevenCodes22
[17:15:39] <hexacode> i need to load it but its located remotely
[17:17:26] <chee> imsky: would you like some of this morphine diacetate?
[17:17:36] <imsky> chee: i see he showed you his "chat app"
[17:17:38] <Eviltwin> hexacode: You mean where you can basically do AJAX and wait for the return
[17:19:38] <chee> imsky: i was unable to help on account of php makes me feel like i'm rubbing glass into my eyes
[17:19:48] <imsky> chee: if it's not 5.3, it's not php
[17:19:51] <imsky> there's a rhyme for you
[17:20:09] <chee> imsky: so i suggested http://jqfundamentals.com/ and http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[17:20:18] <imsky> chee: you're way too compassionate

[17:25:31] <imsky> you don't get to decide that
[17:25:43] <StevenCodes22> lol depends on my motives ?
[17:25:50] <imsky> depends on how much of a troll you are
[17:26:01] <imsky> it'd take some genuine effort to come off as noobish as you
[17:26:04] <StevenCodes22> and how much you bitch
[17:26:10] <imsky> oh baby
[17:26:12] <imsky> don't hold back

[17:35:02] <chee> what a large question mark
[17:35:11] <BinaryKitten> wang_ if by deeply you mean internals, then the only way to do that is read the unminified source
[17:35:18] <imsky> ?g "hungry hungarians"
[17:35:20] <_Pepper> wang_: IMHO, deeply studying something means taking the knowledge you have and create some plugins.

[17:36:56] <imsky> coldhead: oh right, the 80s
[17:37:08] <coldhead> you dafty weans
[17:37:08] <_Pepper> reading the unminified offers some insight, but it is when you create some plugins you start understanding the mechanics and really magic better than  function references. Just my 2 cents
[17:37:13] <wang_> plugins?
[17:37:16] <chee> the 80s is where the smiths are from isn't it

[17:40:57] <imsky> coldhead's an old liberal
[17:41:01] <imsky> likes making people feel weird
[17:41:22] <chee> i love coldhed more than my mother
[17:41:29] <chee> but she doesn't know him so that's probably why
[17:41:30] <imsky> does your mother love coldhead though?
[17:41:42] <imsky> i bet she hates how it feels when she hasn't shaved
[17:42:01] <coldhead> you curr
[17:42:04] <imsky> cur
[17:42:07] <chee> i like how it feels when i have veeted my whole body
[17:42:19] <chee> i am all silky smooth like a dolphin or a lady
[17:42:26] <imsky> "or a lady"
[17:42:28] <chee> coldhead: should i get a cabin
[17:42:33] <imsky> Sir Sirloin or a Lady
[17:42:38] <imsky> the new hot act
[17:42:41] <coldhead> a cabin on wheels chee?
[17:42:49] <chee> coldhead: a cabin on WAVES
[17:42:52] <imsky> coldhead: he's going away on some trip to the baltic sea
[17:43:06] <coldhead> this all sounds very romani
[17:43:12] <imsky> i know he's a gypsy
[17:43:28] <chee> always stealing bricks
[17:43:32] <chee> or a lady
[17:43:35] <imsky> lady bricks

[17:43:57] <chee> this is my new name
[17:44:12] <imsky> if you put sir in front of anything, that makes it instantly respectable
[17:44:14] <chee> Sir Sirloin Ladybricks is the newer hot act
[17:44:15] <imsky> Sir George Bush
[17:44:18] <coldhead> it's when they ask you to hold their baby and then they steal your smartphone and rearrange all your appointments, that's the worst gypsy thing
[17:44:19] <chee> wow
[17:44:32] <chee> Sir Gypsies
[17:44:34] <imsky> coldhead: i thought you were male
[17:44:45] <imsky> coldhead: all this time i thought you're part of the camaraderie
[17:44:49] <coldhead> i don't know why you had that impression
[17:44:51] <imsky> turns out you're an old white lady
[17:45:00] <imsky> scared of the romani peoples
[17:45:03] <imsky> and their octoroons
[17:45:04] <coldhead> at my age gender is irrelevant
[17:45:11] <chee> i don't understand the benefit of an outside cabin over an inside cabin
[17:45:12] <imsky> yeah you basically look like your spouse
[17:45:17] <imsky> chee: rain
[17:45:18] <chee> also, i am pretty sure they are both inside
[17:45:18] <coldhead> there's just an especially wrinkly bit that fluids leak from
[17:45:29] <imsky> coldhead: that's your nose
[17:45:41] <coldhead> no, i can tell that's a different one
[17:45:44] <coldhead> blood comes from it
[17:45:46] <imsky> can you?
[17:45:52] <imsky> you got octoroon eyes
[17:45:55] <imsky> they see in triplicate
[17:46:01] <chee> coldhead: how do you know which one is which
[17:46:06] <imsky> he doesn't chee
[17:46:07] <coldhead> actually my racial purity is impeccable
[17:46:08] <imsky> or should i say
[17:46:10] <imsky> she doesn't chee
[17:46:20] <imsky> coldhead: i know, you octoroon
[17:46:21] <coldhead> she chee?
[17:46:27] <chee> you should see a doctor
[17:46:31] <coldhead> i need another drink
[17:46:35] <imsky> .cur is a windows format for cursors
[17:46:44] <coldhead> as a chase for the one i had 25 years ago
[17:46:47] <imsky> you.cur then is very hilarious
[17:46:58] <chee> it's supported as an argument to cursor:; on internet explorer
[17:47:07] <imsky> bot-chee?
[17:47:09] <coldhead> cursor: you.cur?
[17:47:11] <chee> i lerant this yesterday
[17:47:17] <imsky> lerant?

[17:47:32] <imsky> Sir Lerant and Ladybricks present Sir Sirloin and his Gallivanting Band of Octoroons
[17:47:33] <coldhead> apparently there are sites where you can download fun cursors 100% free
[17:47:36] <coldhead> but i've never seen one
[17:47:40] <imsky> coldhead: just install this .msi file
[17:47:51] <bot-chee> coldhead: html { cursor: url(you.cur); }
[17:47:55] <imsky> lol
[17:48:08] <imsky> the cursor should just have the word "you" and "cur" blinking
[17:48:22] <coldhead> i overheard some young people explaining emoticons to a shopkeeper yesterday
[17:48:34] <coldhead> "look at it sideways and it's a smiley face" "oh is that what that is"
[17:48:44] <imsky> :O
[17:48:47] <chee> urls are supported as an argument for cursor in every modern browser except for one. 50 points if you can guess which browser
[17:48:49] <coldhead> EXACTLY
[17:48:58] <imsky> chee: firefox
[17:49:00] <coldhead> opera!
[17:49:02] <chee> wow is that what those things are
[17:49:04] <v0lksman_> does jquery-ui automatically bind to <button> tags?  if so is there a way to disable that?
[17:49:06] <chee> coldhead: DING DING DONG
[17:49:10] <imsky> stupid opera
[17:49:16] <chee> you have won 50 pwnts
[17:49:25] <imsky> chee: arent you leaving the country dere

[17:49:41] <imsky> you cur
[17:49:47] <imsky> it works rather well
[17:49:58] <coldhead> do you do much development on your wii?
[17:50:07] <chee> opera is the only browser really worth using
[17:50:14] <imsky> yeah i basically write everything on my wii
[17:50:19] <imsky> i use etherpad on it
[17:50:25] <coldhead> i wish to invest in your startup

[18:00:40] <imsky> why would you phonetically misspell things on twitter
[18:00:42] <someprimetime> hey i've got tabs that i'm changing the active state to with an id... they are re-usable tabs (plugin style within its own namespace) so there might be 2 sets of tabs on the same page, both with the id="selected" on the currently selected one
[18:00:46] <coldhead> you dont HAVE to use irc
[18:00:48] <someprimetime> should i change this to a tab instead?
[18:00:56] <coldhead> imsky: text to speech?
[18:00:57] <bencahill> coldhead: i.e. if I had one repeating element, I'd have a hidden one that I'd clone and append?
[18:00:58] <someprimetime> or perhaps use an attribute such as selected='true'
[18:01:00] <imsky> coldhead: are you a real Man dats always dea fa me?
[18:01:10] <coldhead> bencahill: yes, that can be a good solution
[18:01:24] <coldhead> give it a try and come get help if you get stuck
[18:01:27] <bencahill> coldhead: sounds good, I'll see what I can work up
[18:01:27] <someprimetime> should i change this to a tab instead, should say should i change this to an attribute instead?
[18:01:40] <someprimetime> or should i keep the currently selected tab an id
[18:01:42] <bencahill> coldhead: sure thx...not sure if I will even work on this right away :P

[18:33:52] <Eviltwin> Yes, how do I getElementById in jQuery?
[18:34:04] <imsky> man
[18:34:05] <imsky> that's tough
[18:34:12] <imsky> i suggest jQuery.getElementById
[18:34:16] <imsky> that's really your best option
[18:34:30] <Eviltwin> It says "jQuery is not defined"
[18:34:32] <Eviltwin> Is this a bug in jQuery?
[18:34:33] <imsky> ah right
[18:34:36] <imsky> no no
[18:34:38] <imsky> stay calm
[18:34:41] <Eviltwin> I'm pretty sure it is
[18:34:42] <imsky> just put this line above
[18:34:44] <Eviltwin> I think I should report it
[18:34:44] <imsky> jQuery = window
[18:35:48] <Eviltwin> Okay
[18:35:54] <Eviltwin> And I want to wait before I run my code
[18:36:00] <imsky> yeah, wait like a couple hours
[18:36:04] <imsky> let it stew
[18:36:08] <Eviltwin> But JavaScript doesn't have sleep() WTF?????

[18:36:19] <imsky> that's good enough for you sir

[18:39:38] <Eviltwin> I really, really hope so
[18:39:39] <imsky> he has to be
[18:39:59] <systemfault> I'm sure he's not...
[18:40:06] <imsky> yeah i'm getting that vibe from comments
[18:40:11] <systemfault> Human stupidity has no limit.
[18:40:21] <systemfault> Even einstein said it.
[18:40:49] <Eviltwin> Ha ha ha: http://www.phpied.com/a-rounded-corner/
[18:41:34] <imsky> i don't know what to think about this guy
[18:41:37] <imsky> retards don't write books
[18:41:44] <imsky> well
[18:41:50] <imsky> not many books about programming
[18:41:57] <Eviltwin> I thought Microsoft wrote books about programming
[18:42:04] <imsky> no that's msdn
[18:42:08] <imsky> books are just msdn chapters
[18:42:09] <systemfault> In the PHP world... That guy must be a genius.
[18:42:19] <imsky> systemfault: what do you program in?
[18:42:35] <systemfault> imsky: Anything I need.... including sometimes PHP
[18:42:45] <imsky> so that makes you one of the lepers
[18:42:55] <Eviltwin> systemfault: The person who introduced it here was a PHP person, I think
[18:43:04] <imsky> Stoyan Stefanov (http://phpied.com, @stoyanstefanov) is a Facebook engineer. Previously at Yahoo! he was the creator of the smush.it online image optimization tool and architect of YSlow 2.0. performance tool.
[18:43:06] <systemfault> I'm a programmer, not a PHP programmer :)
[18:43:15] <Eviltwin> Oh shit
[18:43:16] <imsky> i don't believe it
[18:43:20] <imsky> this guy's actually competent
[18:43:32] <systemfault> imsky: Because he has a loud mouth?
[18:43:38] <imsky> systemfault: facebook/yahoo
[18:43:48] <Eviltwin> To be honest
[18:43:51] <systemfault> Yeah.. because HRs are always competent..
[18:43:52] <Eviltwin> If you read the beginning of the post
[18:43:54] <Eviltwin> "PHP has a sleep() function, but JavaScript doesn't. Well, this is because it's useless, you might say, and you'll be right. But for simulating heavy processing and for misc performance measurements, it could be useful. So here's how you can go about creating a sleep() in JavaScript."
[18:43:59] <imsky> yeah i know Eviltwin
[18:44:10] <imsky> but he should have said "yeah there's no real way to do this because js doesn't work like that"
[18:44:28] <imsky> no shame in saying something is infeasible or only accomplished the wrong way
[18:44:29] <bandroidx> hey anyone here use the jstree plugin and have any idea if its possible to remove the triangles on expandable items?
[18:44:31] <Eviltwin> He should have said that this was a bad idea and immediately zero'd out the hard drive he wrote it on
[18:44:35] <imsky> ^
[18:44:39] <systemfault> :D
[18:44:50] <chee> coldhead always says that javascript is lisp ith c syntax
[18:44:50] <Eviltwin> bandroidx: Pretty sure it's in the settings somewhere
[18:44:55] <imsky> lithp?
[18:44:59] <bandroidx> Eviltwin: ok cool thanks i will keep looking :)
[18:45:00] <imsky> whath lithp?
[18:45:08] <systemfault> chee: Meh, it's more like scheme + self with a C syntax
[18:45:20] <imsky> someone's been reading wikipedia
[18:45:27] <bandroidx> Eviltwin: basically i just dont want to give up that much space since its barely going to fit in my sidebar as is :)
[18:50:16] <chee> imsky: i have written my email to them
[18:53:00] <chee> imsky: http://ompldr.org/vY21ydA/pasta
[18:53:40] <coldhead> goddamnit chee that is not what i said
[18:53:52] <coldhead> i killee
[18:54:16] <chee> \:D/
[18:54:40] <chee> my right arm is in the wrong place on this keyboard
[19:01:11] <abjorn> man
[19:01:13] <abjorn> why
[19:01:18] <abjorn> did i get mcdonalds chicken selects
[19:01:27] <abjorn> why aren't there any good chicken places around here
[19:01:28] <abjorn> this is awful
[19:01:39] <abjorn> I mean, it's better than KFC, but it's still terrible
[19:01:47] <abjorn> I regret this decision
[19:01:57] <chee> i m so sorry, abjorn
[19:04:02] <abjorn> me too, chee, me too...
[19:04:40] <chee> there's nothing i can do
[19:04:57] <chee> how much mashed potato do you have to eat before you turn into a ghost
[19:05:04] <chee> wrong window
[19:06:32] <coldhead> i think everyone has a different limit chee, you just have to keep mashing and eating until it happens
[19:10:19] <hexacode> anyone know a good tutorial for the basics of an ajax request object and how to use it...i need to grab a file from the server called feed.json
[19:27:43] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/UHxsu/ how come when you hover on the image from the bottom the span disappears?
[19:35:15] <crankharder> how do I access public variables of a widget externally?  $('div').someWidget().eh?
[19:36:24] <chee> someprimetime: because you are MOUSING OUT when you go on the span
[19:36:26] <chee> :O
[19:36:27] <ajpiano> crankharder: $("div").data("someWidget").whatEver
[19:36:29] <chee> someprimetime: hoever!
[19:36:42] <chee> someprimetime: .hover() takes two functions as an argument
[19:36:54] <chee> someprimetime: one for when you stop hovering like a boss
[19:37:05] <someprimetime> ah ok, i'll go with hover
[19:37:06] <someprimetime> thanks
[19:37:08] <chee> someprimetime: so you could try this
[19:37:10] <chee> http://jsfiddle.net/UHxsu/1/
[19:37:29] <someprimetime> B) nice thanks
[19:46:04] <crankharder> ajpiano: i'm trying to get the this._active variable out of this widget: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/jquery.fileupload.js  I even tried adding a method:  active: function(){return this._active;} - but that doens't seem to work either
[19:46:51] <ajpiano> can you post a demo of the code you're actually trying ?
[19:47:39] <crankharder> not really.  it's really just that and initializing the widget: $('#fileupload').fileupload();
[19:48:17] <ajpiano> $("#fileupload").fileupload("active") isn't working?
[19:48:21] <crankharder> the widget's demo is here http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[19:49:02] <ajpiano> that doesn't have your new specsial active method in it
[19:49:55] <crankharder> that did it
[19:49:55] <crankharder> thanks
[19:50:05] <ajpiano> that's how you call a public method
[19:50:19] <ajpiano> you asked how to get at an arbitrary "public" property :p
[19:51:38] <crankharder> well, i realized taht _active isn't public afterwards :)
[19:51:50] <crankharder> if i can get that w/o my newly added public method that'd be nice :)
[19:52:03] <ajpiano> $("foo").data("widgetName")._active should work but what you did is a lot better
[19:52:45] <crankharder> i agree, but it's not my widget, and i'd have to maintain the diff :/
[19:55:20] <someprimetime> they converted their site to use bootstrap?
[19:55:30] <someprimetime> thanks twitter. get ready for the homogenized web, everyone.
[19:55:42] <ajpiano> crankharder: just duck punch your method on
[19:55:48] <ajpiano> instead of modifying the source
[19:56:05] <ajpiano> or extend
[19:56:43] <chee> duck punch!!
[19:57:07] <tw2113> duckduckgo punch?
[19:57:21] <joshsmith> lol yes tw2113
[19:57:31] <joshsmith> I'm going to Gabriel's office hours soon
[19:57:41] <ajpiano> $.widget("crankharder.fileupload", $.bluemp.fileupload, { active: function() { return this._active; } }); $.bridge("fileupload", $.crankharder.fileupload);
[19:58:09] <ajpiano> crankharder: that will make a new widget that xtends from theirs, adds the new method, and then assingns $.fn.flieupload to make new ones of yours instead of theirs
[19:58:24] <joshsmith> random question. does anyone store like global user metadata in their HTML anywhere
[19:58:24] <ajpiano> $.widget.bridge("fileupload", $.crankharder.fileupload), that is
[19:58:58] <joshsmith> I'm doing some Kissmetrics stuff in my JS and I'm thinking about just dumping some of my session information into the HTML itself
[19:59:14] <joshsmith> then accessing that from my JS
[19:59:37] <joshsmith> literally just a user type and a unique ID
[19:59:45] <joshsmith> wasn't sure if this was a typical pattern or not
[20:00:37] <ajpiano> i think it's fairly common, i've done it
[20:00:48] <patbam> hi, is there a way to combine toggle with .on()?
[20:01:14] <joshsmith> any particular place you like to put it ajpiano
[20:01:21] <patbam> http://pastie.org/3319340 that doesn't seem to work
[20:01:26] <joshsmith> btw, long time no speak dude
[20:01:42] <ajpiano> as json in an element or script tag i gues
[20:01:55] <joshsmith> you still in Boston?
[20:02:01] <ajpiano> not at the moment, no
[20:02:08] <joshsmith> orly
[20:02:19] <ajpiano> i don't live there
[20:04:03] <joshsmith> oh, gotcha
[20:06:26] <crankharder> ajpiano: not sure why, but that is breaking the entire widget.  nothing works now.  there's no error
[20:06:50] <ajpiano> hmm
[20:07:10] <ajpiano> you could try a simpler and dirtier approach instead
[20:07:48] <ajpiano> $.blueimp.fileuploader.prototype.active = function() { return this._active; };
[20:09:28] <crankharder> cool, that works
[20:27:24] <khmer> horse
[20:27:56] <chee> patbam: can i see the html associated with this?
[20:28:17] <patbam> chee: sure, one sec
[20:28:42] <chee> patbam: oh, hang on.
[20:29:14] <chee> toggle is not an event, is it
[20:29:38] <chee> thefirst argument to .on() is meant to be an event or a map of event i think
[20:30:24] <chee> i have not actually used .on() very much in my own code because the people I work with are unable to deal with the present. golden age thinkers. they use .live() for everything
[20:31:58] <patbam> chee: i guess jquery doesn't treat 'toggle' an event?
[20:32:18] <patbam> i should have put this on jsfiddle but: https://gist.github.com/1742711
[20:33:01] <patbam> argh, uploaded wrong version please hold
[20:36:03] <patbam> chee: ok here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/zzXPe/
[20:37:03] <chee> patbam: am i wrong? i have never heard of the event 'toggle', not for anything even svg paths
[20:37:29] <patbam> somehow i was under the impression that jquery made toggle into a pseudo event
[20:37:31] <patbam> am dumb
[20:38:09] <patbam> well, this works : http://jsfiddle.net/zzXPe/1/
[20:40:07] <patbam> chee: thanks for your thoughts
[20:40:11] <chee> patbam: ah
[20:41:10] <QbY> Please forgive the newbie question…  Building a database driven site in PHP.  Does jQuery give me the ability to "link" selects (<select><option></option></select>).  ie. A person selects their state, and after selecting the state the second the select for a list of counties is repopulated…  If so, what's the function/term I should search documentation for?
[20:41:18] <chee> toggle() is a method you see. not an event
[20:43:23] <landypro> QbY: See if this helps: http://jqapi.com/#p=change
[20:43:32] <QbY> thank you
[20:44:29] <coldhead> well played, landypro
[20:46:36] <landypro> coldhead: only found out about jqapi.com the other day
[20:46:41] <landypro> very cool :D
[21:02:01] <dr1337> hi guys, got a quick question regarding jquery scale function
[21:02:10] <dr1337> i have a hidden div with visibility none
[21:02:35] <dr1337> it's also relatively positioned with auto margins to be in the center
[21:02:55] <dr1337> whenever i run the scale function the animation starts with the div in the upper left corner of the container div
[21:03:04] <dr1337> is there a way to get it to start in the middle?
[21:07:37] <coldhead> how are you showing this div, dr1337
[21:07:46] <dr1337> .show()
[21:13:43] <coldhead> dr1337: you probably need to use ?animate
[21:13:44] <bot-t> dr1337, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[21:13:53] <dr1337> thanks
[21:14:09] <coldhead> might need to experiment to find the best css properties to animate
[21:14:15] <coldhead> lot of options
[21:14:22] <coldhead> hello tbranyen
[21:14:31] <tbranyen> is there a way with $.fn.find to get the element you're running find on?
[21:14:41] <tbranyen> coldhead: o hhi
[21:14:54] <tbranyen> $(myElem).find("?") to get $(myElem)
[21:15:28] <coldhead> end() or closest()?
[21:15:38] <tbranyen> i was trying to find some magic selector
[21:15:42] <tbranyen> :self is really what i need
[21:15:42] <coldhead> what the hell are you talking about?
[21:15:49] <tbranyen>     var $root = $(root).find(name);
[21:16:04] <tbranyen> if someone doens't provide a name i want to get $(root)
[21:16:12] <tbranyen> without some retard if statement
[21:16:20] <chee> lol
[21:16:59] <chee> tbranyen: let me see some example code using the imaginary :self selector
[21:17:14] <coldhead> $(root).add(name).last() ?
[21:17:42] <tbranyen> O_o add won't find a nested child
[21:17:57] <coldhead> .add(name, root)
[21:18:03] <coldhead> it's my first day
[21:18:04] <coldhead> fuck off
[21:18:07] <tbranyen> well
[21:18:21] <tbranyen> i basically need to find a selector to do this otherwise its an if statement
[21:18:22] <coldhead> $(name, root).add(root).first()
[21:18:34] <tbranyen> fawwwwk
[21:18:36] <tbranyen> >_<
[21:19:00] <tman> coldhead: would you mind giving me a hand for a sec?
[21:19:00] <tbranyen> there really needs to be an identity selector
[21:19:07] <tbranyen> $(":self","<div>lol</div>") == div
[21:19:15] <tman> whenever you're done of course.
[21:19:17] <tbranyen> $("<div>lol</div>").find(":self") == div
[21:19:40] <tbranyen> we got custom selectors for all sorts of shit
[21:19:40] <coldhead> i am pretty fried tman and i reserve the right to wander off but what have you got
[21:20:13] <tman> ok
[21:20:14] <tman> sec
[21:20:28] <coldhead> tbranyen: people get confused enough about 'this', something called 'self' would blow minds
[21:20:40] <tman> coldhead: http://governance.holmberg.ca/
[21:20:54] <tman> the 3 modules below the carousel are loaded in using .load
[21:21:10] <tman> i need to figure out a way to assess the length of the excerpt copy
[21:21:18] <tman> trim it back
[21:21:26] <tman> so that there's like 20px padding on the bottom
[21:21:37] <landypro> url doesnt work for me :S
[21:21:42] <tman> oh wait
[21:21:47] <tman> dns probably hasn't propogated yet
[21:21:48] <tman> CRAP
[21:21:52] * tman sighs
[21:22:07] <tman> you could spoof it in your hosts file
[21:22:10] <tman> but i don't expec that
[21:22:12] <landypro> yup, no A records :P
[21:22:15] <tman> esp since yer fried :)
[21:22:15] <coldhead> you want multi-line text-overflow: ellipsis
[21:22:23] <tman> woah
[21:22:24] <coldhead> which no browsers support :(
[21:22:30] <tman> didn't recognize that
[21:22:31] <tbranyen> coldhead:
[21:22:31] <tbranyen>     var $root = name ? $(root).find(name) : $(root);
[21:22:35] <tbranyen> at least its not an if statement
[21:22:38] <tbranyen> :-/
[21:22:47] <tw2113> ternary
[21:22:57] <coldhead> that reads clearly tbranyen
[21:23:01] <tman> sec
[21:23:04] <coldhead> a++
[21:23:17] <tw2113> technically it is if/else
[21:23:32] <tman> http://alexandria.yossman.net/~tman/governance/
[21:23:37] <coldhead> he's not talking technically, he's talking readability
[21:23:47] <tw2113> ah
[21:23:56] <tman> so basically i need to target #content .module p
[21:23:58] <coldhead> tman: i would use one of jQuery's many ellipsis plugins
[21:24:02] <coldhead> and get on with my life
[21:24:04] <tman> ok thanks
[21:24:10] <coldhead> it's a hard problem
[21:24:12] <tman> didn't know my problem had a term
[21:24:39] <chee> everyone's problems have a term
[21:24:43] <coldhead> you should write to your congressperson and ask them to get browsers to do multiline text overflow ellipsis
[21:24:55] <coldhead> and we'll save hundreds of hours of our lives
[21:33:56] * _unary Computer has gone to sleep.
[21:35:17] <coldhead> goodnight _unary
[21:38:08] * chee Computer has gone to Northern Ireland.
