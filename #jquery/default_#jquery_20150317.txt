[00:04:37] <YamakasY> is someone able to help me out here ? I have a Label that contains "name:" and I want to add some prefilled text into it using the URL http://pastebin.com/jMKFEqWX
[00:06:02] <CorySimmons> nevermind i'm a baby
[00:08:56] <crantron> Yamakasy:  var nameLabel = $("label:contains(p[0])"); needs to be  var nameLabel = $("label:contains("+p[0]+")");
[00:09:06] <crantron> that was just first glance
[00:09:20] <YamakasY> crantron: aha, ok, let me check... don't I have a issue with the "?
[00:09:21] <YamakasY> oop
[00:09:25] <YamakasY> : I mean
[00:10:18] <crantron> i think that should not throw an error breh.
[00:11:06] <crantron> then again I am asking questions in here too so Im not wizard...yet!
[00:11:21] <YamakasY> crantron: wow, it woeks :)
[00:11:25] <YamakasY> works
[00:11:34] <YamakasY> you saved me for today :)
[00:11:34] * crantron dances
[00:11:53] <crantron> glad I could help :)
[00:11:54] * YamakasY 'puts on the music louder and joins with the pole :D
[00:12:07] <YamakasY> poledancing hehe
[00:12:10] <YamakasY> pile, whatever
[00:12:17] <YamakasY> yeah nice!
[00:12:29] * crantron slowly backs away from dance party
[00:12:30] <YamakasY> it's weird that spaces are just used in the URL
[00:12:41] <YamakasY> crantron: no, it's a fight dance, did you know ?
[00:13:01] <YamakasY> it's not erotic stuff woman should od
[00:13:02] <YamakasY> do
[00:13:03] <crantron> i prefer breakdance fighting if I have to settle something.
[00:13:14] <YamakasY> I always take a break indeed :D
[00:13:21] <YamakasY> good idea
[00:13:42] * YamakasY walks on the dancefloor and walks back because of the break
[00:13:53] <crantron> lol , i'm so effing lost. It's cool tho bro, glad your script works now.
[00:14:22] <YamakasY> hehe
[00:14:26] <YamakasY> thanks!
[00:14:33] <crantron> could anyone look at this, questions are on line 31 and 41 :  http://pastebin.com/rchh8Mmg
[00:14:39] <crantron> :)
[00:16:19] <crantron> im just having scope issues in this plugin boilerplate that I cant figure out
[00:16:57] <YamakasY> crantron: mhh I looked but I'm not that javascript functioned yet
[00:17:36] <crantron> yeah, i feel you, i'm getting super functioned right now.
[00:17:38] <Cork> crantron: you need to store this on line 25
[00:17:47] <Cork> crantron: .click will give you a new this variable
[00:18:40] <Cork> crantron: also you bind the jquery object to this and that is most likely not what you want
[00:18:51] <Cork> (line 33)
[00:18:59] <crantron> so pass this through a reference
[00:19:06] <crantron> on linke 26?
[00:19:10] <Cork> you most likely want .-click((function() {}).bind(this))
[00:19:18] <crantron> i know thats what some other dude told me to do in #javascript
[00:19:49] <Cork> bind "works" it blows away the reference to the element you're working on (so i personally don't like that)
[00:20:08] <Cork> but it is a doable solution
[00:20:16] <YamakasY> crantron: now I can fill in my textfields like this, could I also set the value/option of a dropdown box ?
[00:20:17] <Uhkis> that is so sad function
[00:20:21] <crantron> how is what you just typed different from what i have?
[00:20:30] <crantron> you just added a extra set of parathesis
[00:20:45] <Cork> crantron: you have .click().bind(this)
[00:21:02] <Cork> i had .bind on the function inside the .click() call
[00:21:12] <crantron> ahhhh
[00:21:25] <crantron> lemme try
[00:21:49] <Cork> crantron: so ya, i would to var that = this; on line 25
[00:21:53] <Cork> and remove the bind calls
[00:22:01] <Cork> and use that on line 12 and line 41
[00:22:11] <Cork> i find that cleaner; but that's just me :)
[00:22:26] <crantron> okay your bind just totally worked
[00:22:36] <crantron> lemme try the other way because I like that too
[00:22:42] <crantron> bertter*
[00:23:09] <crantron> YamakasY: one sec bruh
[00:24:10] <YamakasY> crantron: ok homie :D
[00:24:33] <crantron> Cork passing that through the click handler isnt working :/
[00:24:41] <Cork> crantron: you don't need to pass it
[00:24:45] <Cork> it inherits the scope
[00:24:53] <crantron> mind = blown
[00:24:57] <Cork> it if you define it on line 25 it should just work
[00:25:23] <crantron> ... you're a damn genious
[00:26:20] <crantron> yup works
[00:26:23] <crantron> perfect
[00:26:48] <crantron> so what about my second question ?
[00:26:54] <crantron> oh that solves both of them
[00:26:59] <Cork> yup :D
[00:27:08] <Cork> i'm efficient like that XD
[00:27:10] <crantron> geaaaaaaahhhhhhh
[00:27:35] <crantron> heck yes you are, thank you sir, you're a gentleman and a scholar.
[00:27:52] <crantron> YamakasY: so what's up?
[00:28:24] <crantron> Cork: ty so much, that just had a waterfall effect of me understanding this conceptually
[00:28:26] <YamakasY> crantron: it's not up, it's down atm
[00:28:41] <Cork> crantron: nice and yw
[00:28:46] <crantron> well lets see if I can help you
[00:28:51] <YamakasY> crantron: just a sec :)
[00:30:02] <crantron> YamakasY: ill brb gunna drab some water
[00:31:00] <YamakasY> crantron: okay, always good next to coffee
[00:36:53] <YamakasY> crantron: ok, back ?
[00:37:28] * crantron awaits le question
[00:38:17] <YamakasY> crantron: ok, I can set the textfields now using that small script, but I also need to set a dropdown which doesn't have a label... some other javascript code >??
[00:39:39] <crantron> thats find im sure you can select by something else
[00:39:53] <crantron> whats you select field markup look like?
[00:40:19] <crantron> your*
[00:41:16] <Cork> YamakasY: make a fiddle of the html you're trying to work with, it makes it much simpler for ppl to help you
[00:41:18] <Cork> ?paste
[00:41:18] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:41:32] <Cork> (and yes jsfiddle.net is strongly preferred)
[00:41:41] <crantron> noted*
[00:44:19] <YamakasY> Cork: I only have an online example, the fiddle is more work to make
[00:44:31] <YamakasY> http://jinsonathemes.com/ost/shagen/open.php
[00:44:43] <YamakasY> I need to set the dropdown from te url
[00:45:01] <Cork> YamakasY: the fiddle is good cause it makes it easy to give the response back
[00:45:12] <Cork> instead of having to describe how you should solve it
[00:45:20] <Cork> most of the time it doesn't have to be a working fiddle
[00:45:51] <crantron> YamakasY: are you specifically refering to the help topic dropdown?
[00:46:02] <Cork> <_<'
[00:46:12] <Cork> YamakasY: an... don't use event attributes >_<
[00:46:35] <Cork> especially not 15 lines of js...
[00:46:58] <Cork> and javascript: is a legacy prefix you don't need it
[00:47:43] <Cork> YamakasY: why not just use #topicId ?
[00:48:20] <YamakasY> crantron: yap
[00:48:33] <YamakasY> Cork: yes I thought so, but I see people using javascript for it
[00:49:06] <Cork> YamakasY: javascript: was a prefix used back in the late 90's when vbscript was a thing on the web
[00:49:26] <Cork> it has long long LONG since been the defacto language
[00:49:33] <Cork> and the prefix is pointless now days
[00:49:41] <crantron> Yamakasy: rule of thumb, never next javascript always keep it seperate from html
[00:49:51] <crantron> nest*
[00:49:53] <Cork> ^ exactly
[00:50:00] <YamakasY> ye syes
[00:50:05] <crantron> :)
[00:50:15] <YamakasY> but OK, you say just use #topicId but how ?
[00:50:16] <crantron> so one sec. do something like this.
[00:50:18] <Cork> $('#topicId').on('change')
[00:50:31] * YamakasY is more a systemadin with large clusters and netapps :D
[00:50:34] <crantron> ^^the man speaks the truth
[00:50:43] <Cork> $('#topicId').val('new data')
[00:51:49] <YamakasY> yes that is what I do now, but it doesn't fit :S
[00:51:50] <crantron> or if this help $('select#topicId").on('change',function(){//stuff});
[00:52:01] <crantron> one sec
[00:52:07] <Cork> crantron: not element name infront of id
[00:52:26] <crantron> yes
[00:52:46] <crantron> that is le proper
[00:53:02] <crantron> just more specific and yeilds a higher css point score
[00:53:16] <Cork> crantron: no, they are slower
[00:53:29] <Cork> element#id == find the element, then filter it on id
[00:53:42] <Cork> instead of just looking up the id in the browsers id hash table
[00:54:25] <YamakasY> mhh
[00:54:40] <Cork> sure, slower by very low numbers, but it is more text in the selector for negative effect
[00:54:43] <Cork> so... ya...
[00:55:16] <crantron> #nowIKnow
[00:55:32] <Cork> crantron: css selectors is a bit interesting in that being more specific doesn't men faster
[00:55:37] <Cork> it often means slower :)
[00:56:00] <Cork> cause the browser has to do more work to know it has the correct element
[00:56:00] <crantron> makes sense
[00:56:13] <Cork> also another thing very good to know
[00:56:22] <Cork> css selectors work from the element it styles upwards
[00:56:23] <crantron> cork: you won this round.
[00:56:29] <YamakasY> I'm confused how to put it in my working code
[00:56:33] <crantron> :P
[00:56:40] <crantron> sorry Yama: one sec
[00:56:42] <Cork> so body > span runs on ever span in the page
[00:56:50] <crantron> got distracted
[00:56:52] <Cork> and traverses up to its parent to check if that parent is body
[00:57:26] <Cork> so selectors work from right to left (read as space separated)
[00:57:36] <Cork> and each element selector is from left to right
[00:58:02] <Cork> YamakasY: what exactly are you trying to do with the dropdown?
[00:58:45] <crantron> Yamakasy: http://pastebin.com/98mX85tF
[00:58:57] <crantron> i have a feeling that will clear some things for you/
[00:59:05] <YamakasY> Cork: set it on a value, but I do this: http://pastebin.com/jMKFEqWX for the textfields
[00:59:53] <Cork> YamakasY: you want to change it based on the value or the display text?
[00:59:57] <YamakasY> crantron: and I can do a #topicId=foo in my URL ?
[01:00:20] <Cork> YamakasY: you can but it you have to code the action
[01:00:25] <Cork> it isn't built in
[01:00:28] <YamakasY> Cork: no, but that is what I also do from the URL, so I'm not sure if it messes up
[01:00:51] <YamakasY> yeah I need some "refresh" .
[01:00:56] <Cork> YamakasY: btw why not just do this server side?
[01:01:15] <crantron> developer tools break points are a godsend.
[01:01:15] <YamakasY> Cork: because it's not possible, that's the issue
[01:01:20] <Cork> ouch
[01:01:33] <crantron> ^^lol
[01:01:45] <Cork> YamakasY: i would prob use ?id=value&id2=value2 instead of #
[01:01:52] <Cork> and then use window.location.search instead
[01:02:02] <Cork> kinda cleaner even if you have to do it in js
[01:02:36] <Cork> but sure you could use #!id=value&id2=value2 if you prefer
[01:02:52] <Cork> (notise the #! <--)
[01:02:58] <YamakasY> Cork: yes but this was the way I started :)
[01:03:14] <crantron> convention my friend, stick to convention
[01:03:26] <Cork> YamakasY: doesn't mean it isn't a good idea to change :P
[01:03:26] <crantron> better to figure it out now.
[01:03:55] <Cork> also if you use .search you could grab a param parser plugin
[01:04:02] <Cork> so you wouldn't have to do that manually
[01:04:05] <YamakasY> ok, so I should... erm, but how should I convert it like that ?
[01:04:55] <YamakasY> nah ok, first the topidID :D
[01:05:20] <crantron> i would say refactor you code first to get rid of inline JS
[01:05:31] <crantron> get that working
[01:05:32] <Cork> ya
[01:05:51] <Cork> ton of inline js, even in string js (event attributes) is a horror
[01:06:28] <crantron> what were saying, inline js makes baby jesus cry.
[01:07:15] <YamakasY> yeah this is not my code :)
[01:07:17] <YamakasY> just an example
[01:07:36] <Cork> also https://github.com/medialize/URI.js
[01:07:39] <Cork> for the parsing
[01:07:50] <YamakasY> yeah out own code is MUCH slicker :D
[01:07:54] <YamakasY> but
[01:08:02] <YamakasY> the topicId what's the best ?
[01:08:21] <crantron> Cork won that debate :P
[01:08:44] <Cork> YamakasY: $('#topicId').val(1) for example should change the dropdown
[01:09:04] <YamakasY> crantron: no really, I need soem mock up to see if I can accomplish what I need, I need some workaround to test something... so I need to be able to set it from the URL
[01:09:24] <YamakasY> Cork: ok, but than from the URL
[01:09:32] <YamakasY> Cork: I have that part tho
[01:09:35] <Cork> ah
[01:10:10] <crantron> so you cant edit the  .php file?
[01:10:19] <crantron> im confused.
[01:10:31] <Cork> YamakasY: http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/docs.html#accessors-search
[01:11:19] <Cork> also what i would do is prob to put a proxy script infront of the thing you cant modify and do the handling there
[01:11:25] <Cork> (i've actually done this a few years back)
[01:11:33] <Cork> in php of all things >_>
[01:11:54] <Cork> YamakasY: it even has support for query strings in the hash
[01:12:09] <Cork> so ya, you can do what you want in several ways with that plugin
[01:12:23] <YamakasY> mhh I just need the simple way atm
[01:12:43] <Cork> basically take the object it gives you, loop it take the key as name or id and then just find the element and set the value
[01:13:15] <Cork> YamakasY: that really is the simplest way
[01:13:24] <crantron> well man, i think youre out of options
[01:13:44] <crantron> or make a jsfiddle
[01:13:46] <Cork> you can do it you're self so you don't have use the dependency, but that would be quite a bit more complicated
[01:13:58] <Cork> uh...
[01:14:07] <Cork> *you can do it yourself so you don't
[01:14:14] <Cork> man that was a weird typo...
[01:14:42] <crantron> its late man, lol
[01:14:52] <crantron> well i dunno abotu you, but im PST
[01:14:58] <YamakasY> Cork: what you said like $('#topicId').val(1) works, but I need 1 as variable from the url
[01:15:14] <Cork> YamakasY: and i just told you how to get it
[01:15:20] <Cork> 4 mins ago
[01:15:36] <crantron> Yama: you can do what Crok said, or use magic
[01:16:00] <crantron> we can't help with magic here--unfortunately
[01:16:51] <YamakasY> Cork: yes but... erm... I don't get it :)
[01:17:08] <YamakasY> crantron: I ike magic, I'm like Hans Klok
[01:17:17] <Cork> YamakasY: uh, i even linked you to the documentation section
[01:17:40] <YamakasY> Cork: I just read, but I wonder
[01:17:43] <crantron> Cork I'm not sure if he is ready for something like thaty
[01:18:02] <crantron> however I didnt even look :/
[01:18:03] <Cork> crantron: the options would be to start parsing the url with regex
[01:18:07] <YamakasY> Cork: I need to grab the whole uri first ?
[01:18:07] <Cork> and that is a lot harder
[01:18:27] <Cork> at least if you want to avoid a parser that breaks
[01:18:32] <crantron> i suppose so.
[01:18:47] <Cork> YamakasY: no it works with the search value too
[01:18:55] <Cork> so new URI(location.search)
[01:19:09] <YamakasY> Cork: ok... confusing
[01:19:53] <crantron> var uri = new URI(winow.location.href);
[01:20:09] <Cork> crantron: you don't need to give it the full url, .search is enough
[01:20:13] <crantron> ...i think thats how you get the current url
[01:20:21] <Cork> window.location works too
[01:21:10] <YamakasY> crantron: yes but I already so something like it... here: http://pastebin.com/meEbrz9m
[01:22:44] <crantron> Yama: looking over the URI library...its pretty sweet
[01:22:48] <Cork> hmm actually uri.js doesn't provide a compiled lib...
[01:22:56] <crantron> would probably save you some headache just cruising over it
[01:23:17] <Cork> ah, sorry looked at the wrong place
[01:24:39] <YamakasY> crantron: saw my paste ?
[01:24:55] <crantron> heck yea i saw your paste
[01:25:03] * crantron spits
[01:25:07] <crantron> lol
[01:26:00] <crantron> im tihhnking val is going to be a object, with url variables as properties
[01:26:36] <crantron> im really not good at regex.
[01:27:19] <YamakasY> hehe me neither, I removed the slashes
[01:27:56] <crantron> oh well if you have [1], means its an array
[01:28:21] <crantron> so [0,...,n-1] will return something
[01:28:22] <Cork> YamakasY: http://jsfiddle.net/wg8gxogx/1/
[01:28:34] <Cork> that should be all you need
[01:29:06] <Cork> (don't hot link the url for you're site, download and host it you're self)
[01:29:21] <YamakasY> Cork: the issue is that the ID's are random so I need to use the labels
[01:29:49] <Cork> they are static on the page you linked
[01:30:10] <YamakasY> Cork: no they are not (it's not my site) they are based on sessionID
[01:30:11] <Cork> ah
[01:30:18] <Cork> some are some aren't
[01:30:22] <YamakasY> most are
[01:30:29] <YamakasY> csfr
[01:30:29] <Cork> ouch that really really sucks
[01:30:33] <YamakasY> indeed
[01:30:43] <YamakasY> that is why I use that label
[01:31:07] <crantron> hah! i love when stuff works
[01:31:31] <Cork> well i would prob still go around the id but ya...
[01:31:53] <crantron> ty again cork for that this help. im jammin on this plugin now
[01:31:56] <Cork> so you would have to have a translation table containing the text inside the label
[01:32:31] <Cork> by table i mean var labels = { keyName: 'full label text' }
[01:32:35] <TTomiK> Hey... anyone willing to help with jquery/css -problem? I have 50% wide divs that are variable heights. There can be N divs and I have built a filter that's used to filter (div.hide()) these divs. Now, as the divs are variable heights I need to clear:left the divs that belong to left "column". How can I do clear:left to only odd divs that are visible?
[01:32:41] <Cork> as you don't want to have the full label text in the url
[01:33:18] <Cork> then you would have to do the $('label').filter(function() { return $(this).text() == label; }) dance
[01:33:38] <Cork> and i would prob use $('#' + target.prop('for'))
[01:33:44] <Cork> to get the real element
[01:34:00] <Cork> really really sucky, but if you don't have another choice...
[01:34:18] <Cork> ?ask @ TTomiK
[01:34:19] <b-ot> TTomiK: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:34:23] <Cork> also
[01:34:27] <Cork> ?paste @ TTomiK
[01:34:27] <b-ot> TTomiK: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:35:04] <crantron> TTomiK: $('.odd').each(function(){ if($(this).css('display') == 'block}
[01:35:06] <crantron> '
[01:35:13] <crantron> opps
[01:35:16] <Cork> uh
[01:35:23] <Cork> no
[01:35:25] <crantron> sec.
[01:35:36] <Demonen> TTomiK: Apply a "left" class and a "right" class?  You can also get all sub-elements of the parent and itarate over, ignoring every other one.
[01:35:43] <crantron> you're really blunt Cork
[01:35:54] <YamakasY> Cork: ah ok
[01:36:03] * Demonen sharpens Cork 
[01:36:07] <Cork> crantron: css('display') == 'block' isn't ever what you want to use
[01:36:14] <YamakasY> Cork: but still I will would want to implement search later on
[01:36:30] <crantron> it was just a suggestion off the top of the dome
[01:36:47] <Cork> i'm still trying to parse the question >_<'
[01:37:15] <crantron> he wants tro target each .odd class to clear:left if its visible
[01:37:40] <crantron> i think im smoking what he is packing
[01:37:50] <Cork> TTomiK: the answer is that you normally don't want to use clear:
[01:38:13] <Cork> it doesn't follow the stacking/overflow rules of css
[01:38:19] <Demonen> clear: behaviour in Safari is defined as "Dunno lol"
[01:38:25] <Cork> so it causes all kind of really nasty bugs
[01:38:42] <crantron> really? what do you do then?
[01:38:59] <crantron> ...i have been using clear:left, clear:both for a while
[01:39:05] <Cork> that is why i asked for a visible example
[01:39:17] <Cork> often display: input-block is the best option
[01:39:27] <Cork> uh... display: inline-block >_<'
[01:39:36] <TTomiK> Demonen: Thanks, that could work. I've used float left / display:inline-block so far and it works nice when all the divs are visible
[01:39:37] <Cork> but not in all cases
[01:39:40] <crantron> oh, i was like wtf is input-block
[01:39:44] <crantron> im a failure web dev
[01:39:55] <Demonen> lol
[01:39:56] <crantron> yeah inline-block is a rightewous solution too
[01:39:59] <TTomiK> clear:left / both, works
[01:40:19] <Demonen> TTomiK: How about you jsfiddle an example of this?
[01:40:27] <Demonen> I'm not clear on what the problem is.
[01:40:28] <Cork> personally i avoid float ass much as i can
[01:41:06] <Demonen> There is a way to "fix" clear, but it is messy as all hell.
[01:41:13] <TTomiK> Demonen: I can try to make something up to show the problem
[01:41:28] <Demonen> Please do, as it makes it so much easier to assist.
[01:41:33] * YamakasY slams head
[01:42:34] <crantron> whats up Yama: i just finished my last commit/push for the night...itry my best to help you out
[01:43:45] <YamakasY> crantron: I know :)
[01:44:06] <YamakasY> I can't get that &topic=10 not working
[01:48:37] <crantron> sec
[01:49:07] <crantron> Yamakasy: have you ever used breakpoints in developer tools?
[01:49:58] <YamakasY> crantron: nope, but I found something, using search ;)
[01:50:13] <crantron> so its working?
[01:52:47] <crantron> i will take that as a yes. goodnight, the matrix wishes you godspeed in your endevours.
[01:55:38] <YamakasY> crantron: yo
[01:55:52] <YamakasY> crantron: sleep well I guess ?
[01:57:12] <crantron> whats up bro, still need help?
[01:57:26] <crantron> im on my last leg.
[01:57:53] <YamakasY> crantron: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28537478/dropdown-selected-with-url-parameter
[01:58:02] <YamakasY> crantron: I know that with 120h a week
[02:00:26] <crantron> Yama: so why dont you use the getURLParameter func?
[02:01:49] <YamakasY> crantron: I do, but I have some issue with the ? and # I guess
[02:03:13] <crantron> and what was with th eproblem of changing that to ?
[02:04:38] <YamakasY> crantron: ok, I have have it working with ?topic=foo#label:=bar&label2=candy
[02:04:50] <YamakasY> crantron: ok, I have have it working with ?topic=foo#label:=bar&label2:=candy
[02:06:11] <crantron> interesting
[02:06:14] <crantron> lol
[02:06:56] <YamakasY> crantron: can't I use that same get getURLparameters for my labels ?
[02:07:06] <crantron> the URL schema just looks really error prone to me
[02:07:15] <crantron> i never said you couldnt...have you tried?
[02:08:35] <YamakasY> crantron: I mean the for () part I pasted you earlier
[02:10:11] <crantron> imma be honest with you, you should rework the url to convention
[02:10:34] <crantron> get somewhere you can test the code freely
[02:11:05] <crantron> we would have had this done an hour ago if you put 20 minutes into setting a test env up
[02:12:10] <crantron> but thats me, ill be on tomorrow around the same time if you havent figured it out, until then i recomend you make the impossible possible an set up some sort of testing env.
[02:14:28] <Omar-> good morning
[02:15:44] <DaFiN> hello, i am not so good at web development just yet
[02:16:03] <DaFiN> but, could anybody possibly help me with using .menu() i want a horizontal menu
[02:16:25] <DaFiN> i was able to create 1, but, the layer 2 of menu is messed up
[02:16:29] <DaFiN> i paste jsfiddle.net gimme 1 min
[02:20:25] <mp_se> hi
[02:20:28] <Bogdaniel> guys i have a page with a photo gallery ... and everytime i click on a picture to load the original size it first shows the modal without any picture can you  help me out please ?
[02:20:55] <Cork> Bogdaniel: most likely cause the image isn't precached
[02:21:16] <Bogdaniel> Cork, i see and is there a way :D ?
[02:21:39] <mp_se> is it possible to catch if user clicked "yes" or "no" button in the ui dialog?
[02:21:49] <Bogdaniel> Cork, http://pastebin.com/Atn3EYJU here's the code :-s
[02:22:14] <Cork> you could do $('<img>').on('load', whenDoneDoThis).attr('src', url);
[02:22:35] <mp_se> I need to know which button is pressed so I could trigger some other action in "beforeClose" event
[02:22:37] <Cork> mp_se: you define the callbacks when you define the buttons
[02:25:07] <mp_se> oh, thank you. yes, that's the one I needed
[02:25:23] <Bogdaniel> thank you Cork  :-)
[02:28:43] <DaFiN> http://jsfiddle.net/twxkn1hp/ this is that jsfiddle
[02:29:21] <DaFiN> its more of a css question; maybe i should join #css
[02:30:36] <Cork> DaFiN: the problem is with the css, make sure you have the correct css for the menu
[02:31:14] <DaFiN> Cork: i am trying, but, is there a way in jquery also, to set menu horizontal or only css is possible?
[02:32:25] <YamakasY>  crantron thanks my man!
[02:35:25] <Cork> DaFiN: css defines how the widget looks
[02:35:36] <Cork> js only defines the "actions" of the widget
[02:35:39] <YamakasY> Cork: you thank you too
[02:35:46] <YamakasY> should I kiss someone ?
[02:36:10] <Cork> preferably not
[02:36:21] <YamakasY> Cork: but it's free!
[02:36:38] <Demonen> Kiss yourself?
[02:36:55] <YamakasY> Demonen: I do all day :) hugging kissing, a person need to love himself!
[02:37:27] <Demonen> You're the only person you know for sure you'll spend the rest of your life with, so if you don't love yourself, you'll be miserable.
[02:37:37] <Demonen> Who'd want to spend their life with someone they don't love?!
[02:37:55] <Demonen> ...says I, and read Java books...  Hypocrite!
[02:37:59] <Cork> yes lots of ppl to it
[02:38:04] <YamakasY> Demonen: indeed, lots of people, and especially woman :( have that issue
[02:38:09] <Cork> yes==yet
[02:38:14] <YamakasY> social media is a killer there
[02:38:40] * DaFiN looks up, ya i am in senses; needs to go out
[02:38:40] <Demonen> Well, it's not my fault people are acting weird.
[02:38:54] <Demonen> I'm the sane one, you're all insane.
[02:39:02] <YamakasY> Demonen: but you can help them, that's better than "it's not my fault"
[02:39:08] <YamakasY> Demonen: LOL
[02:40:00] <Demonen> Pff, they'll have to help themselves.  I don't own the world. It's not my responsibility.
[02:40:12] <Demonen> I just keep my path clean, and that's all I can do.
[02:40:26] <YamakasY> Demonen: no but walking away is also easy, what do you think when people walk away from you when you have difficulties ?
[02:40:38] <YamakasY> Demonen: you also have issues, everyone has
[02:40:40] <YamakasY> no path is clean
[02:41:02] <Demonen> Hah, I have issues so long I can't put them all in an array, or it'd overflow my stack.
[02:41:12] <YamakasY> LOL
[02:41:20] <YamakasY> yeah than you want to keep clean, I know what you mean
[02:41:54] <Demonen> Of course I stick by those close to me, but strangers have their own friends (...hopefully), and have to find their own way.
[02:42:23] <Demonen> If I just walked away when the going got tough, I sure as hell wouldn't be a programmer.
[02:42:54] <Demonen> I would have quit at the first SEGFAULT, and that would be the end of it, somewhere in the early nineties.
[02:43:17] <YamakasY> hehe
[02:43:59] * Demonen shakes his walking stick
[02:44:05] <Demonen> You kids and your jquery have it so easy!
[02:44:16] <Demonen> Back in the day we didn't even have reliable DOM trees!
[02:44:42] <Demonen> We used Java applets to make menus and tables for layout!  It was lunacy!
[02:44:52] <Cork> Demonen: document.writeln ftw!
[02:44:54] <Cork> (or not)
[02:45:00] <Demonen> lol
[02:45:19] <Cork> and writeln is so much better then write cause you get new lines! >_>
[02:45:30] <Cork> ya, i was there too the bad old days...
[02:47:09] <Demonen> I think I've isolated where my life went wrong.  "Regular expressions?  What are those?"
[02:47:19] <Cork> lol
[02:48:13] <Demonen> Anyway, lunch meeting that I have to travel 45 minutes for.  Yaay productivity!
[02:48:47] <YamakasY> Demonen: you must be paid by KM :D
[02:48:49] <YamakasY> or mile
[02:51:03] <Demonen> YamakasY: I work for myself so I get paid by the liter of blood, I think.  ;)
[02:51:06] <Demonen> Anyway, I'm out
[02:52:43] <YamakasY> Demonen: hehe, I work for myself too :D
[02:52:46] <YamakasY> later!
[02:55:47] <lutheflu> whois sacho
[02:58:37] <Omar-> is it correct to use $("img" || "video", $parent).whatever()?
[02:59:10] <sacho> you're probably looking for $('img,video')
[02:59:27] <Cork> Omar-: with strings; no
[02:59:45] <Cork> and ya what sacho said is prob what you're looking for
[03:00:15] <Omar-> oh great thanks sacho and Cork
[03:00:38] <Cork> Omar-: ("img" || "video") === "img"
[03:00:54] <Cork> just so you know :)
[03:03:06] <Omar-> Cork thanks, good point :)
[03:03:50] <Omar-> maybe I asked that question before, but I still cant figure it out. code to follow...
[03:05:17] <Omar-> var foo = "<a href='#' bar ? 'rel="bar"' : "nothing here"> foo </a>"
[03:05:39] <Cork> uh
[03:05:45] <Cork> that line makes no sense
[03:06:20] <Cork> its a bit confused about the quotes
[03:06:38] <Omar-> Cork I want to insert some attributes based on a condition
[03:06:40] <asteriskATmarmuD> we got a problem with a custom jquery scrollbar. it does not scroll to the found string when searching on our website. any hits or recommended custom scrollbars?
[03:06:49] <Omar-> either add them or nothing at all
[03:06:55] <Omar-> I know the example is messy
[03:07:03] <Omar-> it's just to give an idea
[03:07:18] <Cork> Omar-: i would prob recommend building an object with the keys and use $('<a>, { attr: {} }) instead
[03:07:24] <Omar-> bar == "bar" ? "yes add attributes" : "no, add nothing"
[03:19:16] <Uhkis> [11:47] < Demonen> I think I've isolated where my life went wrong.  "Regular expressions?  What are those?"
[03:19:22] <Uhkis> LOL
[03:33:27] <sol> hello hello :)
[03:34:08] <sol> rather than selecting an object by id $('#test').html() - is there any way to use a variable that already references the object?  var x = $('#test'); $(x).html(); ?
[03:37:57] <K4T> how I can select span which is under input?
[03:38:16] <K4T> $('input').closest('span') not working
[03:38:27] <sol> K4T; perhaps try next()
[03:38:30] <K4T> I need first span under input
[03:38:53] <K4T> thank you!
[03:39:19] <sol> np
[03:47:54] <tneva82> Okay simple stupid question(sorry. Bit of newbie with jquery). I thought that hiding element with .hide() function would not only hide the element but also make it not take space. However unlinked list elements still seems to take up space after .hide() function. Any ideas on where I'm going wrong?
[03:49:53] <tneva82> ah nevamind. Figured it out just now. I was just being stupid :)
[04:17:24] <fresherdevJSlara> Hello
[04:17:27] <dieck> hi there! I'm searching for a way to define a number input field as "integer" only. Most solutions found on the web propagate a javascript function onkeypress to return only digits, but for sure there must be a simplier way to do this?
[04:17:27] <fresherdevJSlara> I have an issue
[04:17:47] <fresherdevJSlara> when I am adding JS file my jquery has stops working
[04:18:01] <fresherdevJSlara> I am totaly pissed off today
[04:18:09] <fresherdevJSlara> can you help me please
[04:35:02] <temhaa> hello, I am using spring and I want post my form with jquery. I serialized my form and submit. I am using jackson for mapping to object operation
[04:35:11] <temhaa> But I hava a problem.
[04:36:16] <JuJuBee> Someone willing to have a look ? http://jsfiddle.net/3ko8sy1o/7/  If I click on R2-C2, I want to shade everything to the right of that div
[04:37:28] <temhaa> http://pastebin.com/Bn01VFLr
[04:37:36] <temhaa> My serialized data is here
[04:38:35] <temhaa> form field subject value is, "deneme4,deneme1" but json to object is [deneme4,deneme1] I dont want this
[05:03:03] <YamakasY> anyone an example how I can prefill a texfield by name ? like input[name=foo]  ?
[05:05:38] <Cork> YamakasY: quote the value and it should work
[05:05:50] <Cork> $('input[name="foo"]')
[05:06:34] <YamakasY> Cork: where foo is the name of the field ?
[05:06:40] <Cork> yes
[05:06:48] <YamakasY> so I can set a .val() hehind it ?
[05:06:50] <YamakasY> behind
[05:07:52] <JuJuBee> I have divs on a page like <div data-col=3 data-row=5 style="width:128px; height:56px; top:300px; left:404px;">R 5 - C 3</div>  How would I select by row and col?
[05:08:22] <YamakasY> meh that doesn't work :S
[05:08:29] <YamakasY> I tried that already... dunno why
[05:08:30] <Cork> JuJuBee: see the comment i just made to YamakasY
[05:09:12] <YamakasY> Cork: it doesn't get filled :S
[05:09:30] <Cork> YamakasY: make sure you actually find the element you're looking for
[05:09:48] <JuJuBee> Cork: I want to select where data-row=3 and data-col=5 for example so I can change background.
[05:09:49] <YamakasY> Cork: erm, I first need to find it ?
[05:10:07] <Cork> JuJuBee: ya, that is what i just told YamakasY about
[05:10:15] <Cork> YamakasY: $() searches for the element
[05:10:26] <Cork> then .val() sets the value to the found element (the first of them)
[05:11:15] <YamakasY> Cork: yes that is what I do, could a placeholder='bar' make some dust here?
[05:11:23] <Cork> no
[05:11:38] <Cork> YamakasY: at the line where you search do console.log($().length)
[05:11:40] <YamakasY> mhh werid
[05:11:48] <Cork> and make sure you actually make the selection
[05:11:53] <JuJuBee> Cork: $('div[data-row="3"][data-rcol="5"]') ?
[05:12:04] <Cork> JuJuBee: exactly
[05:12:28] <YamakasY> Cork: same example: http://jinsonathemes.com/ost/shagen/open.php Issue details is an input of message
[05:12:35] <YamakasY> or do I need textarea ?
[05:12:48] <Cork> YamakasY: could you share the exact selector you're trying to use?
[05:13:17] <YamakasY> Cork: $('input[name="message"]').val('foofoofoo');
[05:13:34] <JuJuBee> Cork: I have this in a nested loop and r & c are correct (tested with alert)...  $('div[data-col="c"][data-row="r"]').css('background-color','red'); but not changing background
[05:13:53] <Cork> YamakasY: $('input[name="message"]').length => 0
[05:14:13] <YamakasY> Cork: nope I need textarea instead of input
[05:14:33] <YamakasY> Cork: you dissapoint me here :P
[05:14:37] <Cork> so look for textarea?
[05:14:42] <YamakasY> Cork: I did
[05:14:45] <YamakasY> and that works
[05:14:52] <YamakasY> Cork: you dissapoint me again!
[05:14:52] <YamakasY> :P
[05:14:56] <Cork> 'input[name="message"]' < <-- no you don't
[05:14:57] * YamakasY higs Cork 
[05:14:59] <YamakasY> hugs
[05:15:05] <Cork> you are looking for "input"
[05:15:08] <YamakasY> yes
[05:15:14] <YamakasY> and I ndeed textarea
[05:15:15] <Cork> so look for textarea
[05:15:16] <YamakasY> :D
[05:15:19] <Cork> -_-'
[05:15:25] <YamakasY> you needed to point me in the right direction
[05:15:29] <YamakasY> ohohohoh!
[05:15:32] <Cork> uh...
[05:15:38] * Cork fasepalms
[05:15:39] <YamakasY> -1 today :P
[05:15:55] <YamakasY> facepalms ? :P
[05:16:28] <Uhkis> YamakasY: Cork speaks better javascript than english!
[05:20:09] <YamakasY> Uhkis: I know, I was joking him :P
[05:20:25] <YamakasY> OK, now I want to get rid of the #
[05:24:22] <YamakasY> Cork: what is the main city of Java ?
[05:25:16] * YamakasY would say Script ;)
[05:26:52] <JuJuBee> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/3ko8sy1o/8/  the backgrounds are not changing. what looks wrong?
[05:27:29] <Cork> JuJuBee: strings doens't evaluate variable names in js
[05:27:40] <Cork> you have to actually concat the values into the string
[05:27:50] <Cork> (c and r)
[05:28:07] <YamakasY> ok thanks gusy
[05:28:10] <YamakasY> guys
[05:32:20] <JuJuBee> Cork: thanks. you're a big help.
[05:56:42] <porkolt> Hi, $('#div').show(1, function() {});    duration 1 valid?
[05:57:14] <porkolt> it works
[05:57:17] <Cork> porkolt: yes, though it won't ever be that short
[05:57:32] <Cork> you could just as well set it to 0
[05:57:49] <Cork> it will be ~4-9 if the tab is in focus
[05:57:49] <porkolt> Cork, thank you! :)
[05:58:00] <Cork> and more if the tab is in the background
[05:58:34] <porkolt> Thank :)Ö
[06:05:12] <surianup> Hello friendsa
[06:05:50] <surianup> I am adding the JS files at the end of the page and my jquery is not working
[06:06:07] <surianup> what can be the issue according to you
[06:06:09] <surianup> ?
[06:06:12] <Uhkis> hmm, does that 1ms animation _try_ to animate it superfast while 0 hides it without trying to animate?
[06:08:07] <Uhkis> well, show in that case
[06:14:41] <BillCriswell> surianup: Not enough information to answer that.
[06:14:52] <BillCriswell> surianup: Are there any errors in the console?
[06:15:15] <Omar-> is this correct to var foo = str.match(/i\.imgur|imgur|youtube|youtu\.be/g) || "link";
[06:15:27] <Omar-> in case .match() returns "null"?
[06:16:31] <BillCriswell> Omar-: I think match would return an empty array.
[06:16:57] <Cork> Omar-: switch that around and use .test
[06:16:59] <BillCriswell> Wait no way wrong.
[06:17:16] <Cork> (\.imgur|imgur|youtube|youtu\.be/gi).test(str)
[06:17:26] <Cork> will give you true/false
[06:17:42] <sacho> what if he wants the result of match
[06:17:47] <sacho> Omar-, sure.
[06:17:48] <Omar-> BillCriswell, Cork http://jsfiddle.net/czx025gw/
[06:17:51] <Cork> he has || "" in there
[06:18:03] <Cork> so he does
[06:18:19] <Cork> Omar-: .match returns an array like result
[06:18:23] <Cork> so you can't really use || there
[06:18:28] <sacho> of course you can
[06:18:32] <Omar-> I want .match() to return matched string; in case of "null", use "any string"
[06:18:33] <sacho> .match() returns null if it doesn't match anything
[06:18:47] <Cork> sure but it returns an array if it does
[06:18:54] <Cork> so again it doesn't work
[06:18:58] <Omar-> in the demo i provided it works. I just wanted to make sure it's the correct way
[06:19:13] <Cork> you can do something like (str.match()||[])[1] || "link"
[06:19:17] <Cork> but that is kinda nasty
[06:20:15] <Cork> so i would do (\.imgur|imgur|youtube|youtu\.be/gi).test(str) ? str : "link" instead
[06:20:26] <sacho> that wouldn't return you the match.
[06:21:18] <Cork> ah, missed the think at the bottom
[06:21:19] <sacho> Omar-, the demo is working a bit accidentally.
[06:21:28] <Omar-> Cork I need the value of the match, .match() should return "imgur" if the string contains "imgur"
[06:21:50] <Omar-> sacho lol, how come? is it a glitch in js? ;)
[06:22:15] <sacho> it's not a glitch
[06:22:37] <sacho> anyway, I wouldn't use a regex anyway.
[06:22:44] <Omar-> maybe i should convert return .match() value into a string?
[06:23:34] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Where are you getting the url from?
[06:23:38] <Omar-> what would you recommend? here's a smaple of the strings i'll be testing. imgur.com / i.imgur.com / youtube.com / youtu.be
[06:23:47] <Omar-> from an ajax call
[06:24:26] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/retaji/ click any list item and check console log
[06:25:00] <Cork> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/czx025gw/1/
[06:25:39] <BillCriswell> Omar-: You have the domain there. How about just map[domain] ? map[domain].type : 'link'; ?
[06:25:58] <cyberbrai> how can i get the data from li if  i add the data to them
[06:26:00] <Omar-> BillCriswell yup, I'm matching domain
[06:26:06] <Omar-> Cork wonderful
[06:26:28] <Omar-> sacho thanks to you too :) the map idea is definitely brilliant
[06:26:29] <Cork> cyberbrai: could you elaborate on that a bit?
[06:27:33] <sacho> Omar-, http://jsfiddle.net/pwzaw0fj/
[06:27:39] <cyberbrai> var itemData = {};    var current = $("<li>", { id: index, }). html().data('itemData', itemData). appendTo($("ol", this)[0]);
[06:27:44] <BillCriswell> I'm failing to understand the point of the regex.
[06:27:45] <cyberbrai> something like that
[06:28:07] <cyberbrai> on click event i want to get the data from li
[06:28:13] <cyberbrai> that i saved
[06:28:20] <Cork> cyberbrai: so $(this).data('itemData')
[06:28:48] <cyberbrai> on click event if i have a lot if li
[06:29:24] <cyberbrai> so where i define the <li>  id to get the data
[06:29:28] <Cork> cyberbrai: the clicked li is the this variable
[06:29:38] <Cork> so you should only have one
[06:29:47] <cyberbrai>  $(id).data('itemData') like that
[06:29:53] <Cork> no
[06:29:57] <Cork> "this"
[06:30:28] <Omar-> sacho thanks. it's a bit complicated for me. I want always to return "link" in case .match() returns "null".
[06:30:53] <sacho> Omar-, return map[matchKey(str) || 'link']
[06:30:54] <cyberbrai> cork my id is one than how can i set it
[06:31:05] <cyberbrai> withy this
[06:31:21] <Cork> cyberbrai: var id = this;
[06:31:38] <Omar-> BillCriswell domain is "i.imgur.com" or "imgur.com" or "youtube.com" or "youtu.be" or a link that I dont care what it would be
[06:31:48] <sacho> Omar-, matchKey returns the first key that you can find in str - that's fairly similar to what str.match(/yourregex/) did
[06:32:04] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Right, and those are the keys in map, correct?
[06:32:05] <Omar-> BillCriswell if imgur.com => still image, i.imgur.com => animated/gif, etc...
[06:32:16] <Omar-> BillCriswell exactly.
[06:32:39] <cyberbrai> cork i am not getting you point look i have 5 li and each li have different data so on click event i get the id of li but how can i get the save data from li
[06:32:48] <Omar-> sacho i'll test your update
[06:33:16] <Cork> cyberbrai: $('li').on('click', function() { $(this).data('itemData') <<<-- });
[06:33:41] <Cork> it sounds like that is what you're doing and that is the answer
[06:33:56] <Cork> if it isn't; then you need to share more context so you can get a correct answer
[06:33:57] <Omar-> sacho this looks better http://jsfiddle.net/j1ne4adk/ with your new modification
[06:34:15] <cyberbrai> cork:   $("#frame ").on("click","ol li",function (e) {  var deleteId = $(this).closest("li").attr('id'); }
[06:34:17] <BillCriswell> Omar-: When I click those items in the list you gave me the object has a "domain" property. Why couldn't you just do map[domain] ? map[domain].type : 'link' ?
[06:34:36] <Cork> cyberbrai: why closest, the click is on the li
[06:34:37] <sacho> Omar- mhm
[06:35:08] <cyberbrai> i have all < li > or < o l > in div
[06:35:22] <cyberbrai> div id is frame
[06:35:27] <Cork> cyberbrai: the selector is li inside an ol
[06:35:33] <cyberbrai> yup
[06:35:36] <Cork> cyberbrai: so the click will always be on the li
[06:35:51] <Cork> so $(this).closest('li') === $(this)
[06:36:01] <Cork> .closest('li') is pointless
[06:36:12] <cyberbrai> ok
[06:36:28] <Cork> and like i said before to get the data use $('this).data('itemData')
[06:37:03] <Omar-> BillCriswell how would I do this?
[06:37:25] <Omar-> sacho one issue about the code "i.imgur.com" and "imgur.com" return same value
[06:37:28] <cyberbrai> $(this).attr('id'); cork for me
[06:37:30] <Omar-> where both are different
[06:38:04] <Omar-> i.imgur.com == animated/gif and i.imgur.com == still image
[06:38:17] <Cork> i.imgur.com == video actually
[06:38:35] <Cork> webm/h264
[06:38:37] <Omar-> gifv
[06:38:38] <Omar-> yup
[06:38:49] <Cork> the gifv is just what they call it
[06:38:54] <BillCriswell> I think I'm missing something lol
[06:38:56] <Cork> what they actually serv is video
[06:39:03] <Omar-> BillCriswell lol
[06:39:17] <Cork> BillCriswell: the string he uses has more then just the domain name
[06:39:17] * Omar- hands BillCriswell a cup of fresh espreso
[06:39:27] <cyberbrai> Cork $(this).data('itemData') well it's work one more thing i want to know
[06:39:30] <Omar-> Cork yeah, they wrap it in video tag
[06:39:39] <Cork> Omar-: no, not wrap
[06:39:42] <Omar-> and use webm and mp4
[06:39:53] <Cork> gifv is a "fake" type that on the backend is just videos
[06:39:54] <Omar-> i mean, they use video tag
[06:40:07] <Cork> or flash in some cases
[06:40:13] <sacho> Omar-, you'd have to move the i.imgur key before the imgur one, but at that point you have to start managing the order
[06:40:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: The object I'm seeing in the console when I click the item has a "domain" property. I'm not sure why that couldn't be used to do some logic?
[06:40:56] <blinky_> Hi all,  how would I go about disabling an entire html form until a dropdown at the top of the form has been selected?
[06:40:56] <Cork> BillCriswell: i suspect he wants to check something like http://i.imgur.com/pkgYpKA.gifv
[06:41:01] <cyberbrai> cork $(this).data('itemData') on click i can get the data but can i update it
[06:41:17] <BillCriswell> Cork: That shouldn't change what the "domain" property is though.
[06:41:22] <Cork> and if it contains i.imgur.com give is a special icon or something
[06:41:44] <Cork> BillCriswell: the parsing of the url is what the function does
[06:41:55] <Omar-> sacho moving i.imgur before imgur solved. the order doesn't matter. Thanks again :)
[06:42:00] <Cork> sure you could use an a tag for that if you want
[06:42:35] <Cork> var parser = document.createElement('a'); parser.href= url; map[parser.domain]
[06:42:39] <BillCriswell> Instead of just adding items to map though now you have to update a regex.
[06:42:56] <Omar-> BillCriswell i'm doing this to differentiate between still images and animated
[06:43:08] <Cork> Omar-: actually you might want to use that ^
[06:43:13] <BillCriswell> Omar-: but domain is already telling you if it's i.imgur.com or imgur.com
[06:43:25] <Omar-> because each one has a different api url
[06:43:38] <Omar-> images => /gallery/
[06:43:43] <Omar-> animated => /image/
[06:44:02] <Omar-> Cork in your example or sacho's?
[06:44:41] <Omar-> BillCriswell yes I know. I'm using the domain for that purpose
[06:45:24] <BillCriswell> I just feel like something is getting over complicated here is all.
[06:46:18] <Omar-> BillCriswell possibly yes..since i'm not a programmer/developer, you can expect "complexity" in my code :P
[06:46:34] <Cork> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/czx025gw/3/
[06:47:36] <Omar-> Cork document.createElement('a'); is created but not appended?
[06:47:46] <Cork> Omar-: i use it to parse the url
[06:47:48] <Omar-> nic one
[06:47:52] <Omar-> nice*
[06:47:52] <Cork> i don't really need the element
[06:48:40] <Cork> the link fallback is missing though
[06:49:05] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/czx025gw/4/
[06:49:08] <Omar-> Cork this will fail. domains retrieve have no http://
[06:49:23] <Cork> Omar-: so append it to the string
[06:49:28] <Omar-> if you type imgur.com it will fail
[06:49:36] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/czx025gw/5/
[06:49:53] <Cork> (fixed the test string) http://jsfiddle.net/czx025gw/6/
[06:51:00] <Omar-> Cork working flawlessly :)
[06:53:09] * Cork gives the credits to BillCriswell
[06:53:11] <Cork> he came up with the idea
[06:53:37] <Omar-> sorry BillCriswell I didn't understand your idea. kudos to you!
[06:55:27] <rubyonrailed> i'm trying to build my first jQuery plugin.  I'm having trouble overriding a default option.  the save value is still "/save_data" after I override it. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/293ec6b13ebf689d6568  Does anyone know whats going on?
[06:56:20] <Cork> rubyonrailed: where is options suppose to come from?
[06:56:27] <Cork> autosave doesn't take an options
[06:57:34] <rubyonrailed> Cork, ha thanks. I got it. :)
[06:57:40] <BillCriswell> It's all good. I should get better at explaining things.
[06:58:27] <Omar-> BillCriswell :)
[07:02:29] <devs4v> @rubyonrailed You're not passing the options variable in line#2 in th 2nd file where you define the autoSave function!
[07:02:57] <devs4v> hence, the original variable which needs to be overriding the options is not getting passed!
[07:03:04] <rubyonrailed> devs4v: Yeah, Cork helped me figure it out.  Still learning haha.
[07:03:35] <devs4v> @rubdyonrailed : Oh yeah! He did! Apologies! :|
[07:03:58] <rubyonrailed> devs4v: Thanks anyways though!
[07:05:09] <steveccc> has anyone used scrollTop() - I am getting the correct value in firefox but in chrome I get 0?
[07:07:58] <BillCriswell> steveccc: Are you using it on a jQuery object?
[07:09:11] <steveccc> billcriswell: yes, i am using it to find the window scroll position but the url to the page has an anchor link and think firefox is giving the scroll position after the window has moved to the anchor point and chrome is giving the scrollpoint prior to the anchor movement
[07:10:22] <BillCriswell> steveccc: Ah. I see.  You might need to do like setTimeout(function () { ... }, 0); or maybe even requestAnimationFrame?
[07:11:39] <steveccc> billcriswell: thats still giving 0 in chrome :(
[07:12:02] <BillCriswell> Try upping 0 to 50 or something.
[07:12:18] <BillCriswell> Just out of curiosity.
[07:14:50] <Cork> steveccc: could you make an example of this in jsfiddle?
[07:15:02] <Cork> scrollTop() should work without the timer
[07:17:08] <BillCriswell> steveccc: It in in document ready?
[07:17:43] <Cork> i'm more interested in what element it is running on
[07:18:11] <BillCriswell> I assumed window.
[07:18:31] <steveccc> billcriswell: yes
[07:18:47] <steveccc> cork: it is window at the moment - tried a few
[07:19:07] <Cork> steveccc: could you reproduce it in a clean environment?
[07:19:20] <BillCriswell> Cork: http://jsbin.com/qazone/#foo just wrote that up
[07:19:52] <BillCriswell> It is returning 0 in chrome and 8841 in firefox.
[07:20:35] <Cork> it returns 0 here (firefox)
[07:20:58] <steveccc> billcriswell: i am doing it on page load rather than clicking an anchor in a loaded page but I get the same result as you. if I refresh in chrome it gives the correct value so it just seems to be incorrect on page load
[07:20:58] <Cork> though it is jsbin so...
[07:21:13] <Cork> hard to test as it keeps updating as someone else it editing it
[07:21:52] <BillCriswell> Cork: I thought I clicked save lol
[07:22:05] <Cork> BillCriswell: you don't have save in bin
[07:22:17] <Cork> it is one of my big antis with it
[07:22:35] <BillCriswell> I use the little "lock" icon as a save basically
[07:22:40] <Cork> it saves when it likes to
[07:22:50] <Cork> and it updates or it doesn't...
[07:23:22] <Cork> roll a dice and see :)
[07:23:56] <Cork> i've lost to many answers to jsbin that i just never use it anymore
[07:24:38] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qazone/#foo
[07:25:21] <BillCriswell> It is pretty tough following exactly what's going on different version wise.
[07:26:06] <Cork> i used to be very strongly pro jsbin, feels kinda sad to put it at dogfood state
[07:26:46] <temhaa> I have a this string: "file_test (Type: Communication)"
[07:27:03] <temhaa> how can I get "Communication" world in jquery
[07:27:08] <Cork> you don't
[07:27:11] <Cork> you use regex
[07:27:46] <BillCriswell> steveccc: It's working for me with setTimeout() of 0. http://jsbin.com/qazone/4#foo
[07:27:56] <BillCriswell> Wonder if that's a bug.
[07:28:01] <Cork> ?eval "yes"
[07:28:11] <Cork> js> "this?"
[07:28:15] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[07:28:23] <temhaa> ok I know with regex but how? replace command string replaced split doesnt work.
[07:28:27] <Cork> js> print("file_test (Type: Communication)".match(/\(Type: ([^\)]+)\)/)[1])
[07:28:36] <BillCriswell> temhaa: How else might that string look?
[07:28:40] <b-ot> Cork: Communication
[07:29:22] <Cork> BillCriswell: try using .load instead of .readty
[07:29:24] <Cork> *ready
[07:29:54] <BillCriswell> temhaa: Another option...
[07:29:57] <BillCriswell> js> "file_test (Type: Communication)".split(': ')[1].slice(0, -1);
[07:30:01] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[07:30:12] <BillCriswell> js> print("file_test (Type: Communication)".split(': ')[1].slice(0, -1))
[07:30:15] <b-ot> BillCriswell: Communication
[07:30:41] <Cork> i prefer the specificness of the regex
[07:30:50] <Cork> as it doesn't break if something ends up after the )
[07:31:05] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ah, good call.
[07:31:12] <BillCriswell> with the .load
[07:31:17] <Cork> ah :)
[07:31:25] <BillCriswell> steveccc: http://jsbin.com/qazone/4#foo
[07:31:32] <BillCriswell> I don't think steveccc gives a poop anymore.
[07:31:40] <devs4v> Isn't regex an overkill for his problem?
[07:31:59] <Cork> that regex is quite compact
[07:32:04] <Cork> so should be fine
[07:32:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: The same argument could be make for if there's like.. no space after Type: or a space before color and such.
[07:32:19] <BillCriswell> colon*
[07:32:29] <Cork> BillCriswell: well that is easy enough to handle
[07:32:40] <Cork> js> print("file_test (Type: Communication)".match(/\(Type: ?([^\)]+)\)/)[1])
[07:32:45] <b-ot> Cork: Communication
[07:32:45] <Cork> :P
[07:33:07] <steveccc> billcriswell: sorry yes i do still care - was trying something different
[07:34:00] <BillCriswell> js> print("file_test (Type: Communication)".split(': ')[1].split(')')[0])
[07:34:05] <b-ot> BillCriswell: Communication
[07:36:52] <temhaa> Cork: I tried: .match(/\(Type: ([^\)]+)\)/)[1])
[07:37:03] <temhaa> Cork: But I get error: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[07:37:06] <cyberbrai> https://jsfiddle.net/chaudharykuldeepsingh/wzpsfay2/
[07:37:35] <cyberbrai> why this is happen if i drag the second module then same moment it's drag the third module
[07:38:02] <cyberbrai> i know it's problem of ol li how can i fix it
[07:38:15] <Omar-> because it's  a child
[07:39:08] <Omar-> and I dont think having ol in li is valid
[07:39:45] <cyberbrai> omar i want to child draggable
[07:40:02] <cyberbrai> ol in li is valid
[07:41:40] <Omar-> cyberbrai detach child before dragging its parent
[07:41:50] <Omar-> children
[07:42:00] <cyberbrai> how
[07:42:30] <cyberbrai> how  can i do that  if i have a hundreds of child in ol li
[07:42:46] <cyberbrai> so i have to detach every child it's long process
[07:44:32] <cyberbrai> Omar- how can i detach the children
[07:44:33] <Omar-> cyberbrai i'm testing the code
[07:44:44] <cyberbrai> oook sorry for disturbance
[07:47:13] <Cork> temhaa: could you share a bit more of the line you used?
[07:48:02] <Cork> temhaa: you have an extra ) at the end, it might be what is biting you
[07:48:17] <umdstu> anyone know of a more actively maintained javascript library for list based tables for large sets of data, like http://www.dynatable.com/#a-stylized-list ? SlickGrid and Datatables only support tables, not lists or a 'card' view, like in the dyntable example
[07:49:49] <Omar-> cyberbrai doesnt work or maybe i'm missing something https://jsfiddle.net/801ymswp/
[07:50:51] <temhaa> Cork: I solved. I checked substring is contains string. regex I dont knwo
[07:51:56] <cyberbrai> Omar-  if i tried this  "#list ol li    it's not work so any other alternative way to do that
[07:52:42] <cyberbrai> "#list ol > li not working
[07:52:59] <cyberbrai> Omar
[07:53:21] <Cork> cyberbrai: there isn't a way around that
[07:53:21] <Omar-> cyberbrai you want to drag parent only, right?
[07:53:41] <Cork> the third one is inside the second one so it will by definition be moved when the second move
[07:53:49] <cyberbrai> omar  parent and children both
[07:54:18] <cyberbrai> Cork any alternative way to do that
[07:54:31] <Cork> cyberbrai: possibly
[07:54:36] <Cork> depends on what you need to do
[07:54:44] <Omar-> cyberbrai https://jsfiddle.net/fj6140Lf/
[07:54:48] <Cork> you could add an extra span for the label and use that as draggable instead
[07:55:24] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/wzpsfay2/1/
[07:55:27] <Omar-> cyberbrai i got you know. you want to drag parent when child is dragged?
[07:55:47] <Cork> Omar-: no he want them to behave as separate entities
[07:55:58] <cyberbrai> yes cork is right
[07:56:25] <Omar-> Cork oh ok
[07:56:28] <cyberbrai> Cork omar both fiddle is work
[07:56:33] <MalMen> hello
[07:56:43] <Omar-> cyberbrai cork's solution is the correct one
[07:56:50] <MalMen> i am here in trouble and i dont realise why...
[07:56:50] <cyberbrai> cork i want to know why you wrote $("#list ol li span").draggable({
[07:56:54] <Omar-> hi MalMen
[07:57:01] <cyberbrai> Omar thanks a lot
[07:57:08] <cyberbrai> Cork Thanks a lot
[07:57:14] <Cork> cyberbrai: it drags the span instead of the li, so it doesn't drag the children of the li
[07:57:25] <Omar-> ?ask @ MalMen
[07:57:25] <b-ot> MalMen: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:57:28] <MalMen> on this page https://xmr.space/ i am running some jquery script after including jquery library, and looks like when my code is called the library is not active yet
[07:57:38] <MalMen> i was writing :)
[07:58:04] <Omar-> MalMen we have no patience :P
[07:58:05] <Cork> cyberbrai: though Omar- is selling his solution a bit short, it might actually be what you want
[07:58:14] <cyberbrai> Cork ok
[07:58:23] <Cork> a little hard to tell without seeing what you want to do :)
[07:58:35] <Cork> but you have two options; go play with them :)
[07:59:44] <Omar-> MalMen are you wrapping code in .ready()?
[08:00:54] <Cork> O_o
[08:01:03] <Omar-> d/c
[08:01:30] <Cork> Omar-, MalMen: nope ready is the problem
[08:02:41] <Omar-> didnt get MalMen's response
[08:02:47] <Cork> there wasn't one
[08:02:53] <Omar-> oh ok
[08:02:55] <Cork> :)
[08:02:57] <Omar-> it's not logged yet
[08:03:00] <Cork> so i answered
[08:03:03] <Omar-> haha
[08:03:04] <MalMen> sorry
[08:03:09] <MalMen> was analysing it
[08:03:13] <Omar-> no worries
[08:03:29] <MalMen> another word for wrapping please ?
[08:03:32] <Omar-> cyberbrai you're welcome :)
[08:03:38] <Cork> $(function() {}) <--
[08:03:43] <MalMen> sorry, english is not my native language
[08:03:51] <Cork> MalMen: put that around your jquery event handler
[08:03:52] <Omar-> MalMen espanol?
[08:03:56] <Cork> (the .click line)
[08:04:02] <MalMen> portuguese
[08:04:13] <Omar-> casi iguales
[08:04:13] <Omar-> anyway
[08:04:40] <Omar-> your code for example = $("foo").click(doSomething);
[08:04:54] <Cork> Omar-: no need for example
[08:05:00] <Cork> the code is right there ^^'
[08:05:11] <Omar-> his website?
[08:05:24] <Cork> he gave it in the original question
[08:05:42] <MalMen> hmmm
[08:05:48] <Cork> MalMen: http://jsfiddle.net/fy17h7mf/
[08:05:55] <Cork> that is what it should look like
[08:05:56] <MalMen> the problem is with that click ? i will just delete, it was a test
[08:06:53] <StanAccy> Ive got an event object initiated by a user click.  Can I set a value on that event object that a higher level handler will be able to access (as the event bubbles up the DOM)?
[08:07:11] <MalMen> thank you very much for your patiente , i think i figured it out :)
[08:07:13] <cyberbrai> Cork  https://jsfiddle.net/wzpsfay2/1/ on drop i got nothing
[08:07:42] <Cork> cyberbrai: there isn't a drop in the example
[08:07:49] <Cork> that is kinda what i meant before
[08:08:21] <cyberbrai> Actually i use your code in my workspace but on drop or sort i have nothing i don't know why
[08:08:30] <Cork> StanAccy: i think jquery keeps the event object, but not sure
[08:08:48] <StanAccy> Cork: What do you mean?
[08:09:03] <Cork> cyberbrai: we don't know what it is you're talking about there
[08:09:04] <cyberbrai> ok wait
[08:09:10] <Cork> you only show the drag code
[08:09:47] <MEGAGHZ> Hello
[08:09:58] <Omar-> hello
[08:11:09] <Cork> StanAccy: http://jsfiddle.net/ukLqv0wp/
[08:11:19] <Cork> so no, the event object is a new one for each handler
[08:11:59] <StanAccy> Cork: The data value is undefined in the parent.  Is there any way to pass info between these handlers?
[08:12:07] <Cork> StanAccy: are the event handlers "close to each other"?
[08:12:20] <Cork> StanAccy: the example was to show it isn't possible
[08:12:24] <StanAccy> in the DOM? No.  One is on <html> the other is one whatever - anchors, spans etc
[08:12:30] <Cork> in code
[08:12:40] <Cork> as in are the ex in the same resource?
[08:12:41] <StanAccy> Yeh, in code - they are in the same JS
[08:12:52] <Cork> then use a scoped variable instead
[08:13:29] <Cork> StanAccy: http://jsfiddle.net/ukLqv0wp/1/
[08:13:50] <Cork> StanAccy: though that said, why do you need this?
[08:14:00] <Cork> there might be a cleaner solution
[08:14:17] <StanAccy> we're trying to handle clicks for our popups off-popup (or off popup initiating element)
[08:14:25] <StanAccy> clicking off popup closes all popups
[08:14:51] <StanAccy> Im wide open to a cleaner solution :-)
[08:14:54] <Cork> StanAccy: ah, so you want $(event.target).closest('.popup-selector-parent').length > 0
[08:15:26] <StanAccy> that assumes that every popup initiating element has such a class (which they dont currently have, but could have)
[08:15:31] <Cork> the .popup-selector-parent is the parent selector matching the top most element of those that should not react to the click
[08:15:52] <Cork> StanAccy: that would be the cleanest solution
[08:15:55] <StanAccy> I was trying to avoid that scenario (since its a lot of changes), but it might be the only solution
[08:16:11] <Cork> StanAccy: you could have multiple selectors if you prefer that
[08:16:35] <StanAccy> ID still need to put some identifier class on the initiating element though
[08:16:37] <Cork> the best part with adding that is you won't have to modify the js if you add another dialog
[08:16:52] <negusnegesti> Hello guys,
[08:16:53] <negusnegesti> I have several input fields and I need to prevent the enter key avoiding a form to be sent.
[08:16:53] <negusnegesti> It works nicely with: http://pastie.org/10033065
[08:16:53] <negusnegesti> Unfortunately, it also blocks my textarea field. Is there a way to override this only for one element?
[08:16:53] <negusnegesti> Thx in advance!
[08:17:02] <Cork> StanAccy: you could have .closest('#id1, #id2, #id3...')
[08:17:04] <StanAccy> yes, this is true since our dialogs are non-modal right now
[08:17:55] <Cork> anyway both woks, one needs html modification now, one needs js modifications for every dialog you add in the future
[08:18:13] <Cork> personally i would go with the former, but...
[08:19:10] <Jon30> hey guys... i am using .load("<url> <div class>") to update div's content on the page from a URL. I can't seem to find if there are any events.. such as "beforeReplace", so I could execute some script right after ajax is complete and BEFORE it replaces the content on the page.
[08:19:44] <Cork> Jon30: there isn't anything you can run just before the html is replaced
[08:19:54] <Cork> you would have to use $.ajax or $.get for that
[08:20:04] <Cork> (still wouldn't be an event though)
[08:20:40] <Jon30> Cork: how would i grab the div's class from data variable? $(data).find(".class") doesn't work
[08:22:05] <Cork> Jon30: if it is a top most element you need to use .filter
[08:27:16] <umdstu> anyone use dynatables that has gotten add/remove functionality to json lists ?
[08:28:15] <frabblerock> https://jsfiddle.net/sf8r5xjb/9/ - can anyone help me with this. I'm  trying to get it so that when the bottom of the left-rail reaches the top of the window, it adds margin-top equal to the height of the left rail to keep it into view and usable. I have it so it works the first time, but will not work correctly after.
[08:29:25] <Cork> frabblerock: why not just set it to position: fixed when it reaches the top?
[08:29:41] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock this is kind of an unusual UI - what's it for?
[08:29:43] <frabblerock> its too long to be position fixed
[08:29:58] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/
[08:30:13] <frabblerock> the sidebar there
[08:30:15] <robertmaxrees> that sidebar?  just leave it static.
[08:30:37] <frabblerock> was requested to do this
[08:30:53] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* when will people learn.
[08:31:36] <robertmaxrees> check out something like http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/
[08:32:35] <robertmaxrees> don't animate putting back into view - that makes it SUPER difficult to interact with.
[08:34:07] <frabblerock> yeah, i think it's clunky ui too.
[08:45:11] <Tomasso> anyway to disable the jquery ui autocomplete, to enable it later, so it doesnt autocomplete?
[08:45:53] <robertmaxrees> $( ".selector" ).autocomplete( "option", "disabled", true ); to disable it.
[08:45:59] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-disabled
[09:08:32] <negusnegesti> Someone, anyone?
[09:08:32] <negusnegesti> Or do you know a simple code just to lock the enter key for all input fields? :)
[09:08:51] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[09:10:31] <negusnegesti> See here, please:
[09:10:31] <negusnegesti> (16:16:52) negusnegesti: I have several input fields and I need to prevent the enter key avoiding a form to be sent.
[09:10:32] <negusnegesti> (16:16:52) negusnegesti: It works nicely with: http://pastie.org/10033065
[09:10:32] <negusnegesti> (16:16:52) negusnegesti: Unfortunately, it also blocks my textarea field. Is there a way to override this only for one element?
[09:10:48] <robertmaxrees> please don't multiline copy/paste like that :)
[09:11:03] <Smartky> http://jsfiddle.net/5f1fry0u/
[09:11:14] <robertmaxrees> negusnegesti bind to the forms submit event.
[09:11:25] <robertmaxrees> check where the event target is and go from ther.e
[09:11:32] <Smartky> someone see why the event.onComplete = function () { event is undefined/
[09:12:29] <negusnegesti> Actually, I just need a way to avoid a form to be sent by hitting the enter key... that's all :)
[09:12:34] <robertmaxrees> Smartky http://w2ui.com/web/docs/popup/events this
[09:12:54] <robertmaxrees> negusnegesti right, to do that you need to bind to the form's submit event and prevent it if the user hit the enter key.
[09:12:56] <robertmaxrees> that's how you do that.
[09:13:15] <robertmaxrees> Smartky i don't se an onComplete on that page.
[09:13:46] <Smartky> robertmaxrees : http://w2ui.com/web/demos/#!forms/forms-8
[09:13:49] <Smartky> see this link
[09:13:57] <Smartky> is an oficila example of plugin
[09:14:12] <negusnegesti> robertmaxrees: Thx, I am a newbie - will try it
[09:14:38] <robertmaxrees> Smartky dunno then - the documentation doens't show that method as being available on the event object.  try setting up a fiddle maybe?
[09:15:41] <robertmaxrees> Smartky becuase http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q8ar3qgw/ seems to work.
[09:18:10] <arthurvr> Hey-hey guys!

[09:21:07] <hlvwrk> oh and hey.
[09:42:44] <Omar-> Cork, BillCriswell I will need to change my logic completely in retrieving media type
[09:43:00] <Omar-> i.imgur also hosts still images :/
[09:43:47] <Omar-> so i'm thinking of checking for media by its file extension
[09:44:32] <Cork> Omar-: how would that help you with youtube?
[09:44:48] <robertmaxrees> also file extensions aren't reliable for images ;)
[09:45:08] <Cork> file extensions doesn't exist on the web :)
[09:45:14] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[09:45:24] <decx> on imgur especially
[09:47:39] <Inconvenience> check the header
[09:47:52] <Inconvenience> first few bytes will have ur info
[09:47:55] <Cork> he isn't making a server request though
[09:48:02] <Cork> it just has links
[09:48:02] <Inconvenience> o
[09:48:06] <Inconvenience> geyness
[09:48:11] <Inconvenience> :(
[09:49:37] <umdstu> anyone come across a jquery grid plugin (like these http://codegeekz.com/jquery-grids/ ) that supports paging? sorting? more like http://www.dynatable.com/#a-stylized-list , but actively maintained?
[09:50:31] <robertmaxrees> Inconvenience that's not an ok thing to say btw.
[09:51:07] <Inconvenience> wat is
[09:51:35] <robertmaxrees> "geyness"
[09:51:37] <Inconvenience> r u trying to infringe?
[09:51:45] <Omar-> Cork i'm not sure. I'll need to to isolate images and then check links
[09:51:57] <Omar-> its gonna be a long process
[09:52:03] <Omar-> i'll create a demo
[09:52:12] <Cork> Omar-: you might have to actually pull the html and check for tags
[09:52:35] <Omar-> robertmaxrees, Cork feeds retrieved contains url with file extenstion
[09:52:57] <asteriskATmarmu1> is there a nice jquery scrollbar which also scrolls to findings on the page, when searching the page i.e. using ctrl + f?
[09:53:19] <robertmaxrees> Omar- file extensions aren't a thing on the web really :) i can serve up a png but the URL can say it's a gif.
[09:53:20] <Cork> Omar-: well, ya it might work
[09:53:36] <Inconvenience> just get teh header
[09:53:39] <Cork> or a video but the uri is .html
[09:53:53] <Inconvenience> u can set a limit on how much to read of a file
[09:54:00] <Cork> Inconvenience: again as he isn't contacting the server that is hard
[09:54:10] <Inconvenience> huh
[09:54:55] <Cork> Inconvenience: somewhat guessing, but from what i've seen i think he shows a playlist or something
[09:55:03] <Cork> and want to show an icon for the type or something like that
[09:55:30] <Cork> contacting the server for every link just to know what media type it is is really wasteful
[09:55:32] <Inconvenience> weak
[09:56:49] <Omar-> robertmaxrees, Cork please check this
[09:56:50] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/4h05mt7s/
[09:57:18] <Omar-> I'll explain why I need to do all this.
[09:57:19] <Inconvenience> i dont get y he is even asking
[09:57:25] <robertmaxrees> right, not reliable Omar-
[09:57:31] <robertmaxrees> also, avoid for loops - use forEach() instead.
[09:57:41] <Omar-> what should I do then, robertmaxrees?
[09:57:44] <Inconvenience> Omar-: this is not magic duud
[09:57:49] <robertmaxrees> just said, use forEach()
[09:58:15] <Inconvenience> or for
[09:58:20] <Inconvenience> for i in x
[09:58:21] <Cork> Omar-: ya, not all of them have an extension
[09:58:26] <Inconvenience> but id stay jq
[09:58:27] <robertmaxrees> never for i in x on arrays.
[09:58:29] <robertmaxrees> ever
[09:58:41] <Inconvenience> take it easy
[09:58:46] <robertmaxrees> that'
[09:58:50] <Inconvenience> ur gona break a kneecap
[09:58:51] <robertmaxrees> *that's meant for plain objects.
[09:58:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4h05mt7s/1/ with forEach instead
[09:59:02] <Omar-> when user clicks an image/gif from the list here (http://jsbin.com/retaji/ ) the image/gif will be transfered to another page in order to be able to zoom it.
[09:59:15] <Inconvenience> its actuallyl .each
[09:59:17] <Inconvenience> not foreach
[09:59:20] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/vuvilo/ zoom page
[09:59:25] <robertmaxrees> Inconvenience no need to use jquery each in this case.
[09:59:26] <Omar-> i'm using jQM btw
[09:59:47] <Omar-> Cork yea, not all of them. The difficulty lays here
[10:00:05] <Cork> Omar-: you can't really base it on that
[10:00:12] <robertmaxrees> a plain array forEach is all you should need.  $(object).each() is meant for jquery objects only, and $.each() isn't necessary if you don't need to support IE8 and below.
[10:02:34] <robertmaxrees> Omar- the larger issue you're facing is that URLs and MIME types aren't really tightly coupled.
[10:02:47] <Omar-> btw, i'm going to use imgur API to retrieve data from imgur based on image ID which comes in the end of a link
[10:03:07] <Omar-> robertmaxrees hmmmm..what do you mean?
[10:03:07] <robertmaxrees> you can't rely on, say, imgur's URLs because those don't actually mean anything.
[10:03:28] <Inconvenience> ya its a url
[10:03:46] <Omar-> robertmaxrees imgur url for example (http://imgur.com/68EkP0i) is useful for me
[10:03:54] <Omar-> 68EkP0i is post ID
[10:03:58] <robertmaxrees> to get the filetype though?
[10:04:06] <Omar-> ttp://i.imgur.com/DU1hxeb.jpg as well
[10:04:16] <Omar-> by id I can get type
[10:04:19] <Omar-> i'll show you
[10:04:44] <Cork> well ya you're using the api to get the mimetype
[10:04:58] <Cork> so you aren't basing it on guessing the type from the url
[10:05:02] <Cork> so that works
[10:05:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's legit.
[10:06:29] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/pt3h16dg/
[10:06:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's fine duder.  as long as you're not trying to guess it on the URL, you're fine.
[10:07:22] <Inconvenience> he is acting like its a trick
[10:07:24] <Inconvenience> lel
[10:07:26] <Omar-> well, this is the easy part!
[10:07:51] <Omar-> the hard part is getting imgur ID from reddit feed
[10:08:03] <Omar-> Inconvenience trick?
[10:08:15] <Galaxy_Stranger> hey - anybody got a minute to help me troubleshoot an $.ajax() call?
[10:08:20] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Galaxy_Stranger
[10:08:21] <b-ot> Galaxy_Stranger: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:08:34] <Inconvenience> robertmaxrees: stop m8
[10:08:43] <Galaxy_Stranger> sorry
[10:09:16] <Inconvenience> its natural for ppl to ask
[10:09:32] <robertmaxrees> Inconvenience sure - and there's literally no need to :) we let them know to just ask.
[10:09:55] <robertmaxrees> not at all an unusual thing to tell people.
[10:10:15] <Galaxy_Stranger> I'm wrapping my ajax call inside a method in a class.  The actual call works and I'm getting the data back as the call is in the method - BUT, this doesn't work:  https://jsfiddle.net/jmoa338k/4/
[10:10:47] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger yeah because ajx calls are async
[10:10:57] <robertmaxrees> so that final return statement happens before the code runs.
[10:11:04] <Galaxy_Stranger> orly
[10:11:07] <robertmaxrees> *befopre the .done() and .fail() calls can run.
[10:11:33] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on those calls completing need to be explicitly called by the .done()/.fail()
[10:12:16] <Galaxy_Stranger> ok, so I need to stick the ajax call inside another method?
[10:12:21] <robertmaxrees> you could also do something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jmoa338k/5/
[10:12:23] <Galaxy_Stranger> and call that method before the return?
[10:12:34] <robertmaxrees> no, because that won't force it to be syncronous.
[10:12:47] <robertmaxrees> when you fire the ajax call, the browser fires the request and continues running code.
[10:12:59] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't wait for the ajax request to complete because that'd lock up the browser.
[10:13:03] <hlvwrk> uhhh
[10:14:01] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/c309c5Ln/ i got this idea (robertmaxrees i'll use forEach next time)
[10:14:07] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:14:32] <robertmaxrees> actually you want to use the array map() method here.
[10:14:59] <Omar-> isolate images and links
[10:15:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want to map the array to an images array, and then map it to a links array.
[10:15:20] <Omar-> .map()?
[10:15:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery
[10:15:29] <robertmaxrees> [2015:03:17:10:12:16] <Galaxy_Stranger> ok, so I need to stick the ajax ca
[10:15:31] <robertmaxrees>  woops
[10:15:33] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[10:15:37] <robertmaxrees> there we go derp
[10:16:09] <Galaxy_Stranger> ok, so the ajax call would have access to this
[10:16:38] <Omar-> robertmaxrees you mean after I isolate them?
[10:17:17] <robertmaxrees> Omar- nope.  you can map data.data.children directly into each of those arrays.
[10:18:15] <Omar-> hmmm..i'll need to read first about map
[10:18:20] <Omar-> never used it before
[10:18:38] <Cork> Omar-: its basically the same as $.map
[10:18:45] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.  just native.
[10:18:51] <robertmaxrees> no need to invoke $ for everything :)
[10:18:59] <Cork> what you return in the function gets put into an array that is returned from the function
[10:19:14] <Omar-> yea, but i dont know its functionality still
[10:19:24] <robertmaxrees> it maps one array to another.  that's all.
[10:19:35] <Omar-> brb and thanks robertmaxrees, Cork :)
[10:19:38] <tasaif> is it faster than jquery because it's native?
[10:19:45] <tasaif> or does jquery just call the native one
[10:19:53] <Cork> tasaif: i don't think so
[10:20:00] <robertmaxrees> i never said faster ;)
[10:20:21] <robertmaxrees> at least i hope i didn't.
[10:20:30] <tasaif> I didn't see it anywhere :p
[10:20:34] <Cork> jit compiling the for loop that $.map uses gets about as fast as you can process an array
[10:20:45] <tasaif> but that's the first thing to come to mind when trying to decide whether to use map or $.map
[10:21:03] <robertmaxrees> it removes the dependency on jquery for something that should be trivial.
[10:21:05] <Galaxy_Stranger> Thanks, Robert, I'm going to do my homework on this
[10:21:22] <Cork> the one thing that makes me prefer $.each and $.map is that it works for objects too
[10:21:29] <robertmaxrees> native array methods like map, some, forEach, etc. are nice also because they're descriptive instead of prescriptive.
[10:22:12] <tasaif> what?
[10:22:42] <robertmaxrees> with a for loop, you're telling the computer how to do something - you're prescribing a method to accomplish what you want.
[10:23:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of describing what you want the end result to be.,
[10:23:14] <monk12> anyone know of a masking plugin that works on all Android platforms. I tried with S4 Galaxy and the 2 most popular jquery masking plugins still have issues after 2years since issue brought up.
[10:23:40] <testerbit> If I have a modal that closes when the user drags the mouse off modal and releases the mouse button, how can I prevent this behavior from closing the modal without preventing the user from closing the modal by clicking the background?
[10:24:04] <tasaif> sure
[10:24:25] <Cork> testerbit: you could use a capturing click handler (not possible with jquery)
[10:24:43] <testerbit> Cork: what would one use for that?
[10:24:44] <monk12> I tested both igorescobar/jQuery-Mask-Plugin and digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput. no dice. Predictive Text turned on on the stock keyboard will cause weird duplicate/reverse digit typing on an S4 and other browsers (read S5 might as well)
[10:24:50] <robertmaxrees> or track where the mousedown and mouseup events events happened.
[10:24:52] <Cork> ?mdn addEVentHandler
[10:24:53] <b-ot> Cork: EventTarget.addEventListener() - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
[10:25:04] <Cork> the third argument
[10:25:41] <forQuery> if i wanted to use a cached selector that's in a variable... instead of this id, does anyone know?
[10:25:42] <forQuery>                 jQuery("span#widgetList-LabelSearch", this).focus();
[10:25:56] <robertmaxrees> forQuery huh?
[10:25:59] <Galaxy_Stranger> Can't event listeners be abused?
[10:26:06] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger abused how?
[10:26:15] <forQuery> like... $cachedVariable.focus() would work normall, but this one has this passed in too
[10:26:36] <robertmaxrees> forQuery so you need to do both 'this' AND #widgetList-LabelSearch?
[10:26:44] <Galaxy_Stranger> i was chattig with someone yesterday and someone brought up using event listeners vs things like "onkeup", etc
[10:26:52] <forQuery> i think so... i inherited the code.
[10:27:01] <robertmaxrees> $(this).add($('#widgetList-LabelSearch')) will do that.
[10:27:19] <forQuery> well, i wanted to use a cached selector
[10:27:24] <robertmaxrees> $(this).add($('#widgetList-LabelSearch')).focus() , for instanbe.
[10:27:27] <robertmaxrees> *instance
[10:27:35] <forQuery> so $(this).add($variable).focus(); ?
[10:27:37] <Cork> forQuery: there isn't anything called a cached selector
[10:27:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[10:27:51] <Cork> you have a result "array" of elements
[10:27:54] <forQuery> sorry, what do you call it?
[10:28:05] <robertmaxrees> Cork people often refer to var $someThing = $('#someThing'); as a "cached" selector.
[10:28:06] <Cork> a jquery object would be correct
[10:28:17] <forQuery> got it, thank you for this
[10:28:20] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger don't use inline handlers.
[10:28:24] <forQuery> lol, what are cork people
[10:28:25] <robertmaxrees> if that's what they were suggesting.
[10:28:48] <robertmaxrees> forQuery i was telling Cork that people often call those "cached selectors"
[10:28:53] <decx> tastes like cork, talks like people
[10:29:06] <robertmaxrees> they also float very well
[10:29:23] <Cork> yup, haven't drown yet
[10:29:58] <Galaxy_Stranger> maybe that's what they meant
[10:30:17] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger inline event handlers like onClick , onBlur , etc. are kind of a bad idea imo.
[10:30:34] <Cork> ya, in multiple ways actually
[10:30:45] <robertmaxrees> separations of concern and all that
[10:30:56] <Cork> everything in global scope
[10:31:03] <Cork> evaling javascript
[10:31:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah exactly.
[10:31:13] <Cork> strings in strings
[10:31:15] <Galaxy_Stranger> that's something I need to read up on
[10:31:34] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery, just use .on() and be happy.
[10:31:59] <Galaxy_Stranger> that's the thing - I'm not familiar enough with JQuery's methods
[10:32:10] <robertmaxrees> * jQuery :)
[10:32:13] <robertmaxrees> and you'll learn.
[10:32:28] <Galaxy_Stranger> heh
[10:52:38] <tasaif> anyone ever made an upload progress bar?
[10:53:06] <robertmaxrees> plenty of people have ;)
[10:53:26] <tasaif> ok
[10:53:33] <tasaif> have you ever heard of the event fileuploadprogressall
[10:54:41] <tasaif> have you ever heard of the event fileuploadprogressall
[10:54:42] <tasaif> ?
[10:55:04] <tasaif> is that a jquery event or some other library's custom event?
[10:55:05] <robertmaxrees> what do you need?
[10:55:15] <tasaif> I need an upload progress bar
[10:55:26] <robertmaxrees> iirc the blueimp file upload plugin uses progressall iirc.
[10:57:06] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah, i'm not sure using a global object will work for me
[10:57:26] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger right, because your issue has nothing to do with scopin.
[10:57:29] <robertmaxrees> *scoping
[10:57:33] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah
[10:57:33] <Omar-> will do some tests later this evening
[10:57:44] <Galaxy_Stranger> hmmmmm
[10:57:50] <Omar-> Cork, robertmaxrees i will keep you posted
[10:57:54] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger you issue has everything to do with the fact that ajax is async
[10:58:04] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah, i understand
[10:58:21] <Galaxy_Stranger> I've written code in the past that waits on a request
[10:58:30] <Galaxy_Stranger> I can do that elsewhere, i think
[10:58:49] <robertmaxrees> right - that's what .done() and .fail() are for.
[10:59:19] <Galaxy_Stranger> hmmm, this is complicated.
[10:59:31] <robertmaxrees> not as much as you're making it :)
[10:59:37] <Cork> Galaxy_Stranger: you an write sync ajax calls, but that is legacy js
[10:59:44] <Galaxy_Stranger> well, it's the fact that I'm wrapping it in a class, right?
[10:59:46] <Cork> and no new features is getting added to it
[10:59:49] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger no.
[10:59:53] <saimon69> greetings, where could i find help on handling the youtube API v3 beside the google sites and stackoverflow?
[11:00:02] <Cork> also js is just getting more and more async so better get used to it
[11:00:02] <robertmaxrees> "classes", scoping, etc have nothing to do with your problem.
[11:00:11] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger you can't return things out of ajax because you can't make things wait like that.
[11:00:16] <saimon69> trying to switch the content of the player on the fly and having problems with it
[11:00:24] <robertmaxrees> so instead you have to tell the ajax call what to do after it's done.
[11:00:42] <forQuery> when you use .find, can you include two selectors inside?
[11:00:48] <robertmaxrees> forQuery yep.
[11:00:53] <robertmaxrees> just like in css.
[11:01:02] <Cork> forQuery: separate them with a comma (in the string)
[11:01:12] <Galaxy_Stranger> right - in .done(), I'd manipulatE the global array object
[11:01:13] <forQuery> i mean like...
[11:01:19] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger no.
[11:01:29] <robertmaxrees> because other code might try to access/use that before that's done.
[11:01:30] <forQuery> jQuery( "li[data-wid='"+aSelected.items[i]+"'] .widget-label" )
[11:01:31] <forQuery> $parentUL.find("li[data-wid='"+aSelected.items[i]+"'] .widget-label" )
[11:01:33] <forQuery> are those equal?
[11:01:47] <Galaxy_Stranger> k
[11:01:48] <robertmaxrees> forQuery basically.
[11:02:19] <robertmaxrees> one searches the entire page while the other looks for children of $parentUL
[11:02:33] <forQuery> perfect, thank you robert
[11:02:33] <robertmaxrees> *descendents, not children.
[11:03:05] <tasaif> does a file upload need to go through ajax to get a progress bar?
[11:03:10] <robertmaxrees> yes
[11:03:13] <tasaif> fuck
[11:03:19] <Galaxy_Stranger> hah
[11:03:42] <tasaif> pardon me
[11:10:35] <igcewieling> I'm using jQuery UI Dialog (though it might not matter).  I'm trying to find a selector to specify "the viewable part of the screen" so I can position the dialog in the center of the screen instead of the center of the element (which might be many screens long).  Does anyone have any ideas/suggestion?
[11:11:57] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12586840/how-center-modal-dialog-in-scrolled-window-with-position-absolute
[11:12:11] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling ^ need to recosider what you're trying to do :)
[11:17:53] <jammanbo> Simple one. Trying to create a dialog programmatically. Getting an error from `$.widget._createTitlebar`. Anyone help? http://jsbin.com/cihideyena/1/edit?html,js,console
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> you have jquery included twice.
[11:19:41] <jammanbo> hmm … so I did. And indeed it works in the jsbin. Back to my code I guess …
[11:20:37] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: thanks.  My alternative plan is to position it a specific coordinates.
[11:21:53] <igcewieling> looking like a better and better idea the more I read about it.
[11:22:03] <robertmaxrees> you can center in the viewport just fine.
[11:25:27] <Juslintek> Hi, how to make this happen from right side? $('.nivo-caption').animate( { width: 'show' }, { duration: 1000, easing: 'easeOutBounce' } );
[11:25:46] <Galaxy_Stranger> robertmaxrees - does it make sense to create a loop that looks for the global array object to be updated?  because it will either fail or not at one point, it's not going to go off into space
[11:30:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:31:01] <robertmaxrees> how does a for loop solve anything here?
[11:31:07] <Galaxy_Stranger> ok
[11:31:23] <Galaxy_Stranger> the ajax call will have access to the global array object
[11:31:39] <Galaxy_Stranger> make the method call containing the ajax
[11:31:50] <robertmaxrees> right - then tell the ajax what should happen next.
[11:32:00] <robertmaxrees> don't check on a global object periodically to see if it has data.
[11:32:06] <Galaxy_Stranger> ok
[11:32:12] <Galaxy_Stranger> how else can I handle it?
[11:32:24] <robertmaxrees> by defining a callback.
[11:32:38] <robertmaxrees> .done(function() { /* your code here */ });
[11:32:54] <Galaxy_Stranger> hmmmm
[11:32:59] <Cork> ppl should make sure they have a good password on there irc account
[11:33:08] <Cork> there is a bruteforce bot on the network
[11:33:30] <Cork> (#freenode is in storm right now)
[11:34:27] <tasaif> thanks for the heads up
[11:34:45] <Galaxy_Stranger> I'm trying to genericize this so all I do is return the data array to the page code
[11:34:53] <Galaxy_Stranger> as it is, I can't return it
[11:34:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:34:57] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[11:35:18] <sacho_> doesn't nickserv have a limit of retries, and also notify you on failed logins?
[11:35:20] <robertmaxrees> if you want to make it generic, make people define a callback.
[11:36:03] <mikunos> hi guys I have a strange issue: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[11:36:13] <mikunos> the row is transEndEventName = transEndEventNames[ Modernizr.prefixed('transition') ];
[11:36:36] <robertmaxrees> mike_f that means prefixed() doesn't exist, which means Modernizr might not exist.
[11:36:41] <robertmaxrees> err, mikunos
[11:37:14] <sacho> if Modernizr didn't exist, the error would be 'cannot get property prefixed of undefined', or something similar
[11:37:22] * Galaxy_Stranger reads up on callbacks
[11:37:28] <robertmaxrees> sacho depends on the browser.
[11:37:39] <robertmaxrees> some browsers will say "undefined is not a function"
[11:37:55] <mikunos> I am using Chrome
[11:38:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah - check to make surew you have modernizr included.
[11:38:16] <mikunos> the strange things is that the error appear only in the mobile version
[11:39:09] <devs4v> @mikunos perhaps you're missing some libraries for the mobile version?
[11:39:30] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger http://fixee.org/paste/4t482aa/
[11:39:34] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this.
[11:41:21] <Galaxy_Stranger> k
[11:43:23] <sacho> robertmaxrees, which browsers are those?
[11:43:41] <robertmaxrees> chrome reports it the way mikunos sees it.
[11:43:49] <robertmaxrees> ff reports that you can't read property of "undefined"
[11:44:19] <sacho> undefined.foo()
[11:44:19] <sacho> VM631:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined
[11:44:27] <sacho> that's chrome.
[11:44:50] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  coulda sworn it didn't used to do that.
[11:45:11] <Galaxy_Stranger> i hate computers
[11:45:41] <robertmaxrees> sacho also a more real-world example would be foo.bar() - undefined is an object ;)
[11:45:54] <robertmaxrees> but chrome reports "foo is not defined" for foo.ar()
[11:46:07] <tasaif> do ajax events only fire on the document object?
[11:46:25] <mikunos> robertmaxrees I have seen the file that contains the error: http://snipet.co.uk/Ha
[11:46:29] <sacho> robertmaxrees, undefined is not an object - but it is defined, so you're right, a more appropriate example would be that
[11:46:41] <mikunos> at the top of the file:
[11:46:41] <mikunos>     transEndEventName = transEndEventNames[ Modernizr.prefixed('transition') ];
[11:47:05] <robertmaxrees> mikunos ... right.  check to make sure you have modernizr included and that it has a prefixed() method.
[11:47:11] <robertmaxrees> tasaif by defauly, yes iirc.
[11:47:39] <mikunos> prefixed ???
[11:48:09] <robertmaxrees> mikunos  Modernizr.prefixed('transition') - this is the method call on that line.
[11:48:20] <mikunos> ok
[11:48:25] <robertmaxrees> either Modernizr doesn't exist, or it does not have a prefixed() method.
[11:50:45] <Galaxy_Stranger> OH - I GET IT
[11:50:54] <Galaxy_Stranger> i write a function somewhere
[11:51:05] <Galaxy_Stranger> and pass it as a parameter to the .done()
[11:51:30] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.
[11:51:33] <Galaxy_Stranger> I hate computers.
[11:52:02] <Galaxy_Stranger> so, how else would I do it?  that's the only callback I can see
[11:54:36] <cranderson> http://pastebin.com/kLFkfW4S : why on line 26 is that executing on document ready, shouldnt it wait until the element gets hovered over?
[11:55:05] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger did you see the example i shared?
[11:55:07] <cranderson> i have tried $(this.element) as well. still the same result. I'm missing something obvious
[11:55:11] <Galaxy_Stranger> yeah
[11:55:21] <robertmaxrees> that abstracts out the ajax call portion so you can define any callback you want based on context.
[11:55:28] <Galaxy_Stranger> i'm trying to make sense of it in the contents of what I'm doing
[11:55:51] <robertmaxrees> cranderson $(this).hover(_that.hoverOver, _that.hoverOut);
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> cranderson right now you're running those functions immediately and assigning their return values to the handler.
[11:56:18] <robertmaxrees> obviously not what you want.
[11:56:30] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger show me what you've got now.
[11:56:37] <cranderson> no i dont man, no i dont
[11:56:38] <Galaxy_Stranger> k, it's kinda lengthy
[11:56:50] <robertmaxrees> Galaxy_Stranger not the whole thing.
[11:56:53] <robertmaxrees> just a small example.
[11:56:55] <robertmaxrees> simplify it.
[11:56:58] <Galaxy_Stranger> k
[11:57:43] <cranderson> robertmaxrees: i did the latter and now its just not working
[11:58:11] <robertmaxrees> your this might not be what you want.
[11:58:22] <cranderson> mkday
[11:58:30] <cranderson> mkay, lemme troll around
[11:58:41] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle if you get stuck.
[11:59:50] <cranderson> k
[12:01:57] <cranderson> suck : https://jsfiddle.net/3bwnap05/
[12:02:02] <cranderson> lol
[12:02:13] <cranderson> stuck*
[12:02:14] <cranderson> hah
[12:02:14] <robertmaxrees> how do I replicate?
[12:03:00] <cranderson> by hovering over design
[12:03:17] <cranderson> it should show new text
[12:03:33] <cranderson> the test that resides in data attribute
[12:03:37] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:03:41] <cranderson> i cant type today sorry
[12:03:54] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not just using like powertip or something else btw?
[12:04:12] <cranderson> tbh I just want to practice
[12:04:39] <cranderson> and our company doesnt like to introduce new stuff to our legacy project
[12:04:42] <robertmaxrees> so first off appending a div to a span is never a good idea.
[12:05:04] <cranderson> noted*
[12:05:26] <robertmaxrees> second off, this is working - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3bwnap05/2/
[12:06:07] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that this._hoverWrapper isn't the object you think it is.
[12:06:11] <robertmaxrees> within your hover methods.
[12:06:27] <cranderson> hmm k lemme think
[12:06:35] <robertmaxrees> check out your page source :)
[12:06:41] <robertmaxrees> in the inspector, I mean.
[12:06:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll see the div there.
[12:07:37] <cranderson> okay
[12:07:39] <cranderson> sec
[12:07:43] <mrcloud> hello. Does anyone know why this code doesn't do anything? http://jsfiddle.net/1xpcn9n2/
[12:08:06] <robertmaxrees> mrcloud because you don't have jquery included.
[12:08:44] <cranderson> well its nested in there
[12:08:51] <cranderson> but why doesnt it show?
[12:09:03] <robertmaxrees> cranderson because the reference that you have in your selector isn't the same object.
[12:09:16] <mrcloud> robertmaxrees: I'm stupid... Anyway, the same code doesn't work on my site using chrome
[12:09:44] <robertmaxrees> mrcloud then you don't have jquery included there or your code is running before the pre tag exists
[12:10:08] <serses> i have a list and i want chilren with index to addClass to it. $("#main ul").children(1).addClass("right"); this add the class to all the li
[12:11:29] <mrcloud> robertmaxrees: that could be the reason... I have a div with contenteditable and a pre inside. Every time a press enter a new pre is added automatically. I suppose that doesn't have the event
[12:11:56] <robertmaxrees> mrcloud there you go.
[12:12:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to use event delegation instead.
[12:12:10] <robertmaxrees> cranderson http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3bwnap05/3/ this is what i'm getting at.
[12:12:16] <robertmaxrees> you're getting tripped up in context and "this"
[12:12:46] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go to lunch. good luck folks.
[12:14:18] <mrcloud> but, how can I get the pre tag? I mean, if I use event delegation I get the events but I need to get the pre where the cursor ir
[12:14:20] <Galaxy_Stranger> robertmaxrees:  https://jsfiddle.net/jmoa338k/9/
[12:15:09] <cranderson> robertmaxtress: so $('.hover-wrapper').show("slow"); that works, but I want to use the reference of the DOM element created in the init(), so it can be repeated if possible
[12:15:30] <cranderson> repeated = reused
[12:16:15] <tasaif> so my upload is going through ajax, but how do I monitor its progress?
[12:18:02] <cranderson> tasaif: http://bit.ly/1MKuRWZ
[12:18:42] <tasaif> I wouldn't ask if I didn't already google it wise-guy
[12:19:18] <cranderson> :P
[12:20:27] <cranderson> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15410265/file-upload-progress-bar-with-jquery
[12:20:40] <cranderson> i googled and found that.

[12:26:39] <tasaif> thanks
[12:43:30] <forQuery> is there a faster way to do the same thing, than using :first
[12:43:31] <forQuery> $this.parents('li:first')
[12:49:53] <forQuery> anyone know if it's better to use .first() or :first
[12:51:58] <jshriver> Greetings, when doing an ajax call how do you specify the name of the variable being sent in data:
[12:52:19] <jshriver> so it can be picked up from PHP via $var = $_POST['data'];
[12:53:00] <jshriver> this is via a post ajax call btw
[12:53:09] <forQuery> it's .first() by 2x
[12:53:23] <jshriver> ?
[12:54:08] <forQuery> if I have a set of li... and i have $this as an input inside the li.  what is the best way to select the parent li for each input.
[12:54:25] <forQuery>   $this.parents('li:first').addClass('labelCheckbox-checked');
[12:54:30] <forQuery> right now i am doing this, but it feels so slow
[12:54:58] <forQuery> can i not select the direct parent somehow?
[12:55:07] <forQuery> and not all the parent li, then filter with first
[12:57:02] <forQuery>  $this.parent('li').addClass('labelCheckbox-some-checked') wont work
[12:57:27] <jshriver> sorry wish I knew forQuery
[12:57:32] <forQuery> :)
[12:59:05] <NoiseEee> this.closest, not this.parents
[12:59:18] <gf3> forQuery: why won't `.parent` work? is it not a direct descendant?
[12:59:20] <NoiseEee> this.closest('li').addClass('someClass)
[12:59:25] <forQuery> oh, thats a great idea.  thank you noiseee
[12:59:26] <adavia> is it bad to use name attributes to trigger events ?
[12:59:27] <NoiseEee> this.closest('li').addClass('someClass')
[13:00:02] <forQuery> it is a direct descendant gf3, wasnt able to figure out why it didnt work.  closest works great!   that makes the list load 200% faster.
[13:00:09] <forQuery> it has about 500 items in list, was super slow before
[13:00:36] <gf3> forQuery: if it's a direct descendant you could always skip jQ entirely
[13:00:40] <gf3> forQuery: this.parentNode
[13:00:53] <gf3> this.parentNode.className += ' butts ';
[13:01:34] <NoiseEee> is it getting hot in here
[13:06:05] <forQuery> i would gf3, but it has 3-4 jquery methods chained after it
[13:06:12] <forQuery> thx for sharing though
[13:08:51] <Ajkthx> what exactly is jquery
[13:08:58] <Ajkthx> like i know what it is, and what it does
[13:09:00] <Ajkthx> but how does it work
[13:09:16] <Ajkthx> is it just a bunch of classes and functions for javascript?
[13:10:08] <gf3> Ajkthx: you can view the source online to see exactly how it works → https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[13:11:34] <Ajkthx> i dont know enough about js to even comprehend what im looking at
[13:21:12] <forQuery> $assignLabelsOuter.on('show.bs.dropdown', function(){
[13:21:13] <forQuery>                 widgetList.label.label_status();
[13:21:13] <forQuery>             });
[13:21:22] <forQuery> what would show.bs.dropdown mean here?
[13:27:22] <robertmaxrees> forQuery please don't paste into the channel like that.
[13:27:27] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:27:46] <robertmaxrees> either way - show.bs.dropdown would be a custom event out of bootstrap.
[13:29:50] <Ukno> hi
[13:30:08] <Ukno> i use autocomplete widget
[13:30:25] <Ukno> problem is, displayed list is wider (more width) than input control
[13:30:46] <Ukno> i did not manipulated width/size of that list
[13:33:04] <Ukno> help!
[13:33:28] <Ukno> on tutorial its width is correct but not on my project
[13:33:38] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball.
[13:33:41] <robertmaxrees> i see nothing.
[13:33:48] <Ukno> i checked in firebug and nothing of my css affects it
[13:34:12] <robertmaxrees> maybe there's some text that's pushing it wider?
[13:34:18] <robertmaxrees> you might need to hard-set a width.
[13:39:37] <pyCasso> is there a reason why my page is returning entire html response when using ajax method?
[13:39:55] <robertmaxrees> because your ajax method is calling the entire page?
[13:40:01] <Smartky> http://jsfiddle.net/Lqekgh6c/
[13:40:56] <Smartky> Guys I continue with the problem, all is ok but the input text doesn't allow me to write inside
[13:41:07] <Smartky> Like it would be disabled
[13:41:11] <robertmaxrees> Smartky a functioning example is usually best.
[13:41:38] <pyCasso> which page would that be? the url parameter?? its just a php file that sends back yes or no.
[13:42:01] <pyCasso> this only happened once i started using twig php template engine
[13:42:05] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso what happens when you hit the file directly and hit "view source" in your browser?
[13:43:04] <pyCasso> ahh. i see an error for some odd reason. the page should be blank
[13:43:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:43:19] <robertmaxrees> that might be a good place to start :D
[13:46:32] <viralfrost> pyCasso: use chrome / firefox debugging tools to view the headers...theyve saved me so much time trying to figure out what's going on
[13:54:26] <Ukno> robertmaxrees: yes i think its text
[13:54:46] <Ukno> let me check
[13:57:42] <rubyonrailed> How do I add select tags to this find?  $(this).find("input[autosave=true], input[type=text], input[type=radio]:checked, input[type=checkbox]:checked, textarea").each(function(i, element){})
[13:57:59] <NoiseEee> rubyonrailed: what would be your guess?
[13:58:14] <rubyonrailed> I've tried input[type=select]
[13:58:17] <rubyonrailed> it didn't work
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> just select
[13:58:22] <robertmaxrees> that's the tagname
[13:58:55] <rubyonrailed> Thanks robertmaxrees
[14:01:20] <basichash> Is it possible to display multiple markers with geocomplete?
[14:03:50] <Ukno> how to overwrite jquery css property?  i add in my custom css file and put !important?
[14:14:25] <adavia> jquery validate uses id for querying the dom?
[14:14:56] <robertmaxrees> might be names.
[14:15:17] <adavia> i see
[14:26:14] <ThePendulum> I was wondering if it's possible to change the animation style for .show. slideDown behaves oddly for some reason; whatever I try, it slides from the top left rather than straight down
[14:44:49] <Ukno> robertmaxrees: thanks, you was right about text pushing it
[14:44:55] <robertmaxrees> cool
[14:47:42] <Ukno> i click Ctrl+F5 in firefox but i get old css
[14:57:46] <Smarteky> http://jsfiddle.net/jcnbvwmf/
[14:57:52] <Smarteky> I believe here is my iissue
[14:58:01] <Smarteky> somebody see some wrong here?
[14:58:24] <Omar-> hi
[14:58:53] <robertmaxrees> Smarteky that should be fine.  looks okay.
[15:02:09] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i'm using forEach ;)
[15:02:15] <robertmaxrees> yesssss
[15:02:16] <robertmaxrees> atta kid ;)
[15:02:23] <Omar-> i'm just not used to have index as a second argument
[15:02:24] <Omar-> haha
[15:02:34] <Omar-> i dont need it anyway
[15:02:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll get used to it.
[15:02:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah normally you don't.
[15:02:52] <Omar-> now to .map() :S
[15:03:01] <Omar-> let see..
[15:03:30] <robertmaxrees> easy.  make an array out of another array.
[15:04:26] <Omar-> i dont need forEach in that case
[15:04:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:04:33] <robertmaxrees> let's say you've got http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qgLhf963/
[15:04:35] <Omar-> .map() will loops through them
[15:04:49] <robertmaxrees> don't think of it as "looping".
[15:04:55] <robertmaxrees> because you'
[15:05:04] <robertmaxrees> *you're instead describing the end result now.
[15:05:21] <robertmaxrees> so given that example, let's say all you really want is all the "value"s in an array.
[15:05:25] <Omar-> hmmm..i'm not sure i'm getting what you mean
[15:05:26] <Omar-> ok
[15:05:55] <Omar-> foo, one, bar, two, etc.
[15:06:01] <robertmaxrees> just one, two, three
[15:06:08] <Omar-> oh ok
[15:06:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qgLhf963/1/
[15:07:01] <Omar-> easy and clear
[15:07:32] <Omar-> but I dont know how I'm going to create two arrays using map in one function
[15:07:37] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[15:07:39] <robertmaxrees> you do it twice.
[15:07:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qgLhf963/2/
[15:08:01] <robertmaxrees> that keeps it clear.
[15:08:54] <Omar-> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/khahmpwx/
[15:09:12] <robertmaxrees> i personally wouldn't do that.
[15:09:28] <robertmaxrees> because now you're munging those two operations.  why do you need the two separate arrays in the first place?
[15:09:57] <Omar-> robertmaxrees because the ones that are hostes by imgur will be having more processing
[15:10:10] <robertmaxrees> then rethink the structure :)
[15:10:12] <Omar-> the "links and youtube" are going to be appended as is
[15:10:22] <Omar-> hosted*
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then you need to rethink your structure.
[15:10:43] <Omar-> what do you recommend?
[15:11:13] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[15:11:21] <Omar-> and btw, I'm doing this as a tutorial for jQM users
[15:11:37] <Omar-> and i'm enjoying it
[15:11:40] <Omar-> please.
[15:13:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/khahmpwx/1/
[15:14:05] <fxmulder_> if I have a div with a class on it that indicates display: none, how do I get .show() to work on it?
[15:14:22] <Omar-> robertmaxrees nice idea!
[15:14:44] <Omar-> robertmaxrees of course, i'll be adding more data
[15:14:59] <robertmaxrees> fxmulder_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L4k8ahak/
[15:15:11] <robertmaxrees> Omar- that's fine - the idea still stands.  you have your one source of data/truth.
[15:15:33] <Omar-> and then reporcess the result to retrieve imgur ID which will be used to communicate with imgur
[15:15:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah if you need to do something further with the imgur stuff, that's fine.
[15:15:53] <Omar-> thanks robertmaxrees i'll play around and show you the results in case you have any recommendation
[15:15:58] <robertmaxrees> awesome :)
[15:16:02] <Omar-> :)
[15:21:37] <Omar-> what's the best way to breakdown such a string "http://imgur.com/QScChlv" or "http://imgur.com/QScChlv.jpg" .gif .png in order to retrieve ID "QScChlv"
[15:22:11] <Omar-> split("/")[str.length-1] ?
[15:23:43] <robertmaxrees> you need to get the length of the array after the split.
[15:25:17] <Omar-> id = value.data.url.split("/")[value.data.url.split("/").length-1];
[15:25:28] <Omar-> i still need to split(".")
[15:25:32] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:25:35] <Omar-> ok
[15:25:36] <robertmaxrees> one-liners make me sad.,
[15:25:40] <Omar-> lol
[15:28:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8b71yba6/
[15:28:56] <robertmaxrees> go with something like this.
[15:29:01] <robertmaxrees> more tytping, but clearer overall.
[15:30:04] <MEGAGHZ> guys, which is a good way to display an overlay on top of all content?
[15:30:17] <MEGAGHZ> just swaping the display propertie?
[15:31:45] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i can make that as a function. many thanks!
[15:32:04] <robertmaxrees> Omar- fshosho
[15:32:13] <robertmaxrees> MEGAGHZ lots of tutorials on that.
[15:32:17] <Omar-> lol what does that mean?
[15:32:24] <robertmaxrees> Omar- "for sure"
[15:32:30] <Omar-> oh ok
[15:32:45] <MEGAGHZ> robertmaxrees: any good one?
[15:33:18] <robertmaxrees> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/11/07/css-overlay-techniques/ this looks legit.
[15:35:36] <michaelgamble> hey for the jquery tabs, is thier a way to add a button the opens a specific tab?
[15:35:52] <michaelgamble> struggling finding online reference around this
[15:35:55] <Omar-> robertmaxrees looks good, yeah?
[15:35:57] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/q3ejLhfk/
[15:36:27] <Omar-> michaelgamble yup, use selected option
[15:36:35] <robertmaxrees> michaelgamble http://stackoverflow.com/a/14497471/923919
[15:36:53] <Omar-> $("tabsID").tabs("option", "selected", "index of tab")
[15:37:00] <robertmaxrees> Omar- yeah that works.
[15:37:12] <robertmaxrees> you can also do $('#tabs').tabs('select', tab);
[15:38:20] <Omar-> !api tabs
[15:38:20] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[15:38:25] <Omar-> hmmm
[15:38:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui, not core
[15:39:42] <Omar-> michaelgamble neglect my answer I was mistaken
[15:40:05] <Omar-> but I aguess .tabs("option", "active", "index") will do
[15:40:32] <Ukno> i added AUTOCOMPLETION widget  and it changed something
[15:40:42] <Ukno> before i had  [text]  [input] [buttons]
[15:40:46] <Ukno> now i have all three in new lines
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> no way for us to know what's up without seeing it.,
[15:41:13] <Ukno> i just attached it to input thats all
[15:41:25] <robertmaxrees> then it should be easy to make a fiddle :)\
[15:41:26] <Omar-> yup, $("#tabs").tabs("option", "active", "2"); works
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> Omar- the issue with that is you'd have to map the button/link to the index of the tab.
[15:42:15] <Omar-> robertmaxrees yea, could be retrieved by class/id
[15:42:21] <Omar-> just a thought
[15:43:10] <Omar-> Ukno make sure that the widget doesn't apply custom classes to input
[15:43:36] <Ukno> Omar-: how will it work then?
[15:43:41] <Ukno> and how to do that
[15:43:55] <Ukno> i did <div class="ui-widget">input</div>
[15:45:10] <Ukno> Omar-:  oh! i removed that div and it is like it was before. thanks
[15:45:32] <Omar-> magic ;)
[15:45:52] <Ukno> didnt knew i am so crap php'er+css'er. i had break months from dev, and im c++ guy
[15:46:12] <Omar-> what's c++?
[15:46:13] <Omar-> :P
[15:46:37] <Ukno> not sure if irony, C++ is programming language
[15:46:44] <Omar-> i
[15:46:49] <Ukno> and i have C++ style brain
[15:46:53] <Omar-> i'm just kidding
[15:47:05] <Omar-> I heard a lot about it since I was in college
[15:47:34] <MEGAGHZ> Pascal is better
[15:47:42] <Ukno> well maybe its just my ignorance and lazyness, i never really learned css or php, i just started using them...
[15:47:48] <Omar-> it was a nightmare for SI students
[15:48:18] <michaelgamble> hey
[15:48:25] <Omar-> Ukno css is easy, the only issue about it is how to make it cross-browser
[15:48:28] <michaelgamble> so am i wrong thinking these tabs were jquery
[15:48:29] <michaelgamble> http://the7.dream-demo.com/shortcodes/5-shortcodes/tabs-top/
[15:48:30] <Omar-> I dont know about php
[15:49:11] <Omar-> Ukno this is css in short: http://imgur.com/gallery/Q3cUg29
[15:49:14] <Ukno> Omar-: good you dont know about php, not something i would recommend.
[15:49:48] <notchris> PHP is powerful when used correctly
[15:49:57] <notchris> The largest CMS in the world uses it
[15:50:16] <Omar-> Ukno i guess i'll be using it build an api for our business website
[15:50:27] <Ukno> Omar-: god, the pic is very true but horrible and scaring. i better do my job fast and stay away from it
[15:50:45] <Omar-> hahaha, Ukno, good luck!
[15:51:08] <Ukno> notchris: not saying it cant be used for big things, problem is php has some magic feature that most programmers write horrible code in it
[15:51:13] <Ukno> myself included
[15:51:50] <notchris> I’m not sure if that’s a problem with the language
[15:52:30] <Omar-> is there any php-like language?
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> michaelgamble jquery UI
[15:52:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not apart of core jquery
[15:53:57] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: can you take a look at this? http://gladpromos.com/login
[15:54:11] <Ukno> notchris: might have, my C++ code is much better. in php i often have project in one few thousands line of codes
[15:54:22] <pyCasso> i can't seem to figure out why im still getting the entire page
[15:54:23] <Ukno> file
[15:54:43] <pyCasso> im using twig template engine, but without twig it works fine
[15:54:49] <Ukno> Omar-: if you want to use some cheap shared hosting you are very limited in choice
[15:55:14] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: it should only pass back a welcome message
[15:55:14] <robertmaxrees> how do i emulate the problem, pyCasso?
[15:55:16] <Ukno> Omar-: from what i remember most force you to php
[15:56:03] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: by submitting the form on the link i sent
[15:56:52] <Omar-> Ukno maybe because most developers have php background
[15:57:28] <Omar-> in case the project to inherited by another team, the team would manage to continue without issues
[15:57:36] <Omar-> to = is
[15:57:55] <Omar-> anyway, i'm off to bed
[15:57:57] <tasaif> Brain fart
[15:58:00] <tasaif> why isn't this working
[15:58:00] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/180z260a/
[15:58:04] <Omar-> goodnight everyone
[15:58:11] <tasaif> goodnight
[15:58:36] <Omar-> tasaif browser security issue
[15:58:45] <Omar-> you cant override it
[15:59:10] <tasaif> no, the first problem was I wrote coffeescript not javascript
[15:59:32] <tasaif> fixed it here http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/180z260a/2/
[15:59:43] <Omar-> user should intentionally click input
[16:00:09] <Omar-> hmmmm weird
[16:00:13] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso ... look at the response from your server.
[16:00:14] <tasaif> if you want to style a custom upload button, this is the only way
[16:00:26] <michaelgamble> is thier jquery ui channel?
[16:00:29] <robertmaxrees> you have the entire page getting tossed back, and then "welcome back" appended to that.
[16:00:33] <robertmaxrees> michaelgamble yes.
[16:00:45] <Omar-> michaelgamble this channel
[16:00:57] <michaelgamble> lol
[16:00:58] <michaelgamble> ok
[16:01:09] <viralfrost> tasaif: jsfiddle.net/auf916kz/
[16:01:17] <michaelgamble> so the tabs in this link dont seem to have a wrapping div ID
[16:01:20] <michaelgamble> http://the7.dream-demo.com/shortcodes/5-shortcodes/tabs-top/
[16:01:32] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:01:36] <robertmaxrees> y'all are making this complicating.
[16:01:39] <robertmaxrees> *complicated
[16:01:42] <michaelgamble> if they are in fact jquery tabs, how do i use the select code suggested earlier
[16:01:55] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/27217066/923919 tasaif
[16:01:59] <michaelgamble> all i want to do is make a button that pops open a tab
[16:02:26] <tasaif> lulz
[16:02:31] <tasaif> I've done that before
[16:02:42] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: this may be more a twig php question im seeing. but yes that html response should only be a welcome message.
[16:02:52] <tasaif> but simulating a click imo is the better option
[16:02:56] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso yeah, your templating engine is busted.
[16:03:00] <robertmaxrees> tasaif i disagree.
[16:03:12] <Ukno> Omar-: he came here to switch you as you go sleep
[16:03:20] <robertmaxrees> go with the minimal markup change instead.
[16:03:26] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: or my code :-)
[16:03:36] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso sure, but it's not a jquery/js issue.
[16:03:53] <robertmaxrees> michaelgamble yeah, check out the links omar- and I tossed out earlier.
[16:04:04] <robertmaxrees> there are div IDs around the content.
[16:04:07] <robertmaxrees> that might be what you need.
[16:04:35] <michaelgamble> yeah but it requires a jquery select thats referencing the wrapping div as an object to identify the sub tab
[16:05:03] <robertmaxrees> sure.  what's the issue there?
[16:05:10] <michaelgamble> $(‘#tabs’).tabs(‘select’…  if thier is now #tabs Id what do i do
[16:05:20] <michaelgamble> *no
[16:05:25] <robertmaxrees> use another selector.
[16:05:42] <michaelgamble> can a class be used as a selector?
[16:05:46] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:06:00] <robertmaxrees> just like in CSS>
[16:06:04] <michaelgamble> ok lol
[16:06:26] <michaelgamble> $(‘.classname’).tabs ?
[16:06:35] <viralfrost> you can use any attribute as a selector, that's why i love jquery :)
[16:06:44] <robertmaxrees> you should avoid doing so when possible fwiw
[16:06:55] <robertmaxrees> michaelgamble yeah, use whatever the original selector was.
[16:08:22] <michaelgamble> it seems like the theme uses a html tag property called role
[16:08:34] <michaelgamble> is thier a way to leverage that as a selector?
[16:08:40] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid doing that.
[16:08:54] <viralfrost> $([role="role"])
[16:08:58] <michaelgamble> stick with classes
[16:09:00] <michaelgamble> ?
[16:09:00] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be slow.
[16:09:04] <robertmaxrees> stick with classes and IDs.
[16:10:29] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want $('.wpb_tabs') maybe.
[16:12:16] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: can I pm you?
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[16:16:24] <michaelgamble> do you guys see anything wrong with my syntax here?
[16:16:25] <michaelgamble> http://pastebin.com/wa5cKcZL
[16:16:48] <robertmaxrees> don't inline javascript.
[16:16:53] <robertmaxrees> put it in a javascript file.
[16:17:23] <michaelgamble> would it prevent it from working?
[16:17:28] <michaelgamble> being inline
[16:17:34] <michaelgamble> i know its not a good practice
[16:17:41] <robertmaxrees> that page has noconflict mode turned on, so $ won't work anyway.
[16:17:47] <michaelgamble> but im just trying to get something quick and dirty done
[16:18:04] <michaelgamble> what do i use instead in noconflict mode
[16:18:09] <robertmaxrees> jQuery
[16:19:10] <michaelgamble> sorry what would that look like?
[16:19:19] <michaelgamble> i replaced the $ with jQuery
[16:19:20] <robertmaxrees> literally use jQuery instead of $
[16:19:38] <michaelgamble> shoot
[16:19:44] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[16:19:44] <michaelgamble> i think it was cause i have a capital j
[16:20:06] <notchris> lol
[16:20:16] <robertmaxrees> but really, don't inline it.  it's so much easier to just pop it into a separate file.
[16:20:20] <robertmaxrees> or even into script tags.
[16:20:25] <michaelgamble> cannot call methods on tabs prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'select'
[16:20:40] <viralfrost> you can also do something like var x = jQuery.noConflict() to set it to x.something instead of jQuery.something
[16:20:59] <robertmaxrees> viralfrost he's inlining code.  that's going to cause headaches in this case.
[16:23:21] <michaelgamble> i probably will pull it out of inline, i just want to figure out the interaction first
[16:23:36] <robertmaxrees> you're going to fight against the inlining in the meantime.
[16:25:58] <michaelgamble> ok i got it working
[16:26:04] <michaelgamble> it was the select method causing problems
[16:26:13] <robertmaxrees> ok
[16:26:16] <michaelgamble> using the active method worked
[16:26:23] <michaelgamble> thanks for the help guys
[16:49:30] <CiE> sup guys
[16:50:27] <robertmaxrees> yo
[16:50:34] <CiE> doing a clone of a  div that contains form elements, but on a class i have it set to trigger on change a modal box. On the cloned elements the modal box is not coming up on change. I think this has to do with everything being in a on document ready, but what should i use to re initialize it after the clones?
[16:51:05] <robertmaxrees> check out the clone() documentation for how you retain event handlers.
[16:51:15] <robertmaxrees> or (even better) use the delegated version of .on()
[16:51:28] <CiE> hmm ok will take a look at the docs thanks!
[16:53:40] <davecore82> I used this function on Steam to unsubscribe from workshop mods for Garry's mod:   function(){jQuery('.btn_grey_black').map(function(){this.click()})})()      Is this pure jquery? If I want to learn more about this method of automating webpage interactions, should I learn jquery? Or am I missing something?
[16:54:16] <robertmaxrees> "pure jquery" lol
[16:54:18] <viralfrost> CiE: if you clone an element, any bindings you have that were attached to the cloned element, won't be active on the newly created element
[16:54:20] <robertmaxrees> jquery is javascript.
[16:54:20] <randomdrake> I'm using addClass() prior to looping a few AJAX calls. Unfortunately, the AJAX calls seem to interrupt the browser being able to addClass(). How I can be sure that's finished before I begin my loop?
[16:55:15] <robertmaxrees> randomdrake put it in the .done() callback.
[16:55:24] <robertmaxrees> any code that relies on the ajax being done needs to be in that callback.
[16:57:24] <randomdrake> robertmaxrees: nothing relies on it being done. $(this).addClass('disabled'); $(".someClass).each(function() { $.ajax() }); $(this).removeClass('disabled'); // The first addClass doesn't finish "drawing" before it gets to the end.
[16:57:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:57:47] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[16:58:17] <robertmaxrees> I'd have to see it in action.
[16:58:35] <robertmaxrees> but that code is basically running the removeClass right after the addClass.
[16:59:10] <randomdrake> robertmaxrees: if I just do: "return false;" prior to the loop, works fine. But the loop itself seems to block the browser from rendering the clicked button. I'd expect the button to go disabled first. Then the loop run with the AJAX requests. Then the button to be enabled. Instead, I click, browser does some work, and never see the first call.
[16:59:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'd have ot see it all in action.
[16:59:41] <randomdrake> I guess if nothing rings a bell here, I'll just debug some more, thanks :)
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> but the browser doesn't wait for the ajax call to hit.
[17:00:35] <viralfrost> maybe your ajax call is just returning so fast that it looks like the button isn't being disabled? lol
[17:00:36] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if having a bunch of ajax calls firing at once, etc is causing some of your headaches.
[17:01:10] <randomdrake> viralfrost: robertmaxrees a bit of both perhaps. It's testing locally, so I know the browser is chugging a few AJAX requests really really fast... *shrug*
[17:01:24] <randomdrake> Gonna keep messing around
[17:01:30] <robertmaxrees> might be getting bit by JIT
[17:03:20] <davecore82> robertmaxrees: So if all I know if Python, should I look at learning Javascript or jQuery? Or is jQuery just Javascript? If so, why a new name and why a channel just for jQuery?
[17:03:26] <randomdrake> Heh, adding a 100ms setTimeout works
[17:03:33] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a library for javascript.
[17:03:40] <robertmaxrees> randomdrake yeah, JIT headaches.
[17:03:45] <randomdrake> robertmaxrees: figured as much.
[17:03:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd refactor so you don't need that timeout.
[17:04:15] <robertmaxrees> davecore82 javascript is a good skill to have.  you can kind of learn both together i guess.
[17:04:17] <randomdrake> robertmaxrees: would love to.
[17:04:29] <randomdrake> robertmaxrees: for now I'll eat the timeout
[17:04:30] <randomdrake> heh
[17:04:34] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:04:34] <randomdrake> Thanks for your help :)
[17:04:36] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:04:36] <davecore82> robertmaxrees: Ok thanks, I appreciate the tips

[17:05:06] <Ukno> bazhang test
[17:07:42] <Synthead> I can't seem to make a jQuery menu hide when I do $(my_menu).menu("collapseAll").hide()  Am I doing this right?
[17:07:53] <Synthead> or collapse, rather: I can't make the menu collapse
[17:08:10] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[17:08:18] <Synthead> if I do .hide() or .menu("collapseAll"), they work individually, but not at the same time
[17:08:26] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: good idea :)  I'll post one
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> return types, Synthead
[17:08:45] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: what about?
[17:09:05] <robertmaxrees> check your console for errors.
[17:09:16] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: there are none
[17:09:25] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[17:15:49] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: why aren't the submenus being displayed in this? http://jsfiddle.net/u2v2x049/
[17:17:42] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:18:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u2v2x049/1/
[17:18:44] <robertmaxrees> old version of JQUI maybe?
[17:22:04] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: yeah, likely.  I'll put my example into this one
[17:22:41] <ekkis> is there a method for displaying or hiding an element depending on a variable? e.g. .display(true) or .display(false)?
[17:28:51] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/u2v2x049/2/
[17:29:11] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: when clicked, the menu gets hidden and is also supposed to collapse
[17:29:49] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: the $("body").click brings the menu back (as this menu is constantly hidden and shown on my page), and when it does, the menu is not collapsed
[17:36:04] <ekkis> Synthead: that's cool.  I've never seen a menu used on the web.  though to be fair, I always hated them
[17:37:13] <Synthead> ekkis: this is going to be used with a spreadsheet that contains cell data based off relationships.  right click and the user can go through a menu of relationships to pick a value
[17:38:40] <ekkis> oh, cool.  it has its uses
[19:22:00] <vanarpsharma> hey jquery
[19:22:22] <vanarpsharma> i had a bug i am unable to solve
[19:22:43] <vanarpsharma> it is inexplicable
[19:44:57] <EredarLord> Hi guys, is there any way to use the data from an Async function both from a callback and by calling its .done() method? here's a barebones example of what I wanna do: http://jsfiddle.net/p8jdesgu/1/

[21:10:09] <elvis4526> how do I get the X index of a set of matched jquery elements ?
[21:10:19] <elvis4526> (like the fifth element in a set of 10 matched element)
[21:31:28] <thealphanerd> hmmm… I don’t know why I didn’t start hanging in here sooner

[22:28:51] <brianarn> something of a random question: I don't suppose anyone here has one of the jQuery Timbuk2 bags and knows the exact model / size it was? I believe it's a Commute, but it's from the pre-TSA model, and I'm not sure of its dimensions.
[22:29:15] <NinjaBanjo> brianarn: the tsa-model is lovely
[22:29:32] * NinjaBanjo has owned the same one for 3 years. it still looks brand new
[22:29:44] <brianarn> NinjaBanjo It is, and i'm wanting to upgrade. I tried buying a Q (as that was the jQuery Foundation backpack) but wasn't happy with a backpack.
[22:29:47] <rmill> brianarn: the search for the perfect bag continues...
[22:29:50] <brianarn> plus not TSA-friendly
[22:29:52] <brianarn> rmill srsly
[22:30:04] <NinjaBanjo> brianarn: don't buy it because its jQuery
[22:30:13] <rmill> wat
[22:30:16] <brianarn> NinjaBanjo I actually own one already. I just don't have the specs. :)
[22:30:21] <NinjaBanjo> oh
[22:30:40] <brianarn> in fact, the jQuery Foundation Timbuk2 bag has been my go-to since I got it in August 2013 at jqcon in Austin
[22:30:56] <brianarn> but the lack of TSA friendliness and having some leftover birthday money is tempting me
[22:31:18] <NinjaBanjo> I have the commute with an all-grey cover
[22:31:36] <rmill> I don't understand, TSA doesn't like those bags?
[22:31:39] <rmill> So weird.
[22:32:07] <brianarn> it's that you have to remove your laptop with them
[22:32:08] <brianarn> the bag is fine
[22:32:18] <brianarn> but the newer bags have this unzip mechanism so that your laptop stays in the bag
[22:32:29] <brianarn> your bag basically opens up butterly-style for easier xraying
[22:32:34] <brianarn> butterfly*
[22:32:37] <rmill> Oh, I see
[22:32:48] <stompdaroach> oh nice. finally lollipop for sony
[22:32:49] <NinjaBanjo> it's great when you travel a lot
[22:32:54] <NinjaBanjo> the butterfly
[22:33:22] <brianarn> but for all my googlin'
[22:33:29] <brianarn> I can't find specifics for the jQuery branded Timbuk2
[22:56:23] <coreyfarrell> is there a user defined setting that I can set through $.ajax(settings)?  I want to associate a text id with jqXHR objects and access it through the onsuccess/onerror callback parameters.
[22:56:33] <surianup> I have very critical issue
[22:56:33] <surianup> for last three days.
[22:56:33] <surianup> I have put my all efforts to fix the issue out
[22:56:33] <surianup> but did not get the solution
[22:56:33] <surianup> I have javascript code actually other developer have wrote this code http://jsfiddle.net/2p27gymf/ when I have added this file in my php file my jquery has stops working
[22:56:33] <surianup> can anyone know please have a look in to this code and then let me know I will thankfull to you for this
[22:56:37] <Woet> surianup: stop spamming
[22:56:44] <Woet> i already told you what caused it
[22:58:12] <stompdaroach> weird way to comment in javascript
[23:05:34] <AlluringMe> Hi
[23:06:26] <AlluringMe> I wanted to know what are the ideas around storing the dynamically generated content
[23:06:39] <AlluringMe> Here is how it looks like
[23:06:40] <AlluringMe> http://jsfiddle.net/8dxpd94h/3/
[23:06:58] <AlluringMe> The textareas appear, and fadeout
[23:07:23] <AlluringMe> whenever there is content in a textarea I want to save the content to DB.
[23:07:33] <AlluringMe> But, how do I get the same layout again?
[23:08:00] <AlluringMe> I am thinking of using AJAX during fadeout to store to DB
[23:08:27] <AlluringMe> But, when there is fadein trigger, I want the data in DB to come back to the same text area
[23:08:57] <AlluringMe> Yelp! :D

[23:56:11] <jak2000> hi
[23:57:02] <alz1> is anyone experienced with jquery tabs?
[23:57:36] <alz1> i try to modify it's default behaviour for creating tabs
[23:59:59] <d3m0n> I am trying to set up a listener for when javascript changes a value of an input but I found out from google that change() doesn't fire if the elements value is changed by javascript. Are there any alternativeS?
