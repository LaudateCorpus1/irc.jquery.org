[00:02:45] <Uhkis> toomus: how about http://jsfiddle.net/p6ghnxfo/
[00:06:40] <toomus> Uhkis: Yep, this works :) THX
[00:07:24] <coderzm> hi all, just a simple question - in this site (http://eatsshootsandroots.org/workshops-and-events/ws1410/), there are two tabs at the bottom "Time, Date, Fees" and "Register Now".
[00:08:00] <coderzm> Time, Date and Fees' content displayed at first load. When user clicks on Register Now, new content reloads in the same box. Is this achieved by .load method?
[00:11:22] <rzeka> Hello. I've got .change listener on form. Is it possible to detect, which field has changed?
[00:11:45] <Uhkis> this should refer to the element
[00:18:58] <jqueryius> Hi
[00:19:03] <jqueryius> I have a file upload box like this:
[00:19:04] <jqueryius> <input type="file" id="signature" />
[00:19:20] <jqueryius> On a button click, I run:  var element = $('#signature');   if (element.files && element.files[0]) { ... etc
[00:19:39] <jqueryius> but it never enters that part of the if statement (it enters the else)
[00:19:44] <jqueryius> I msut be doing something simple wrong
[00:19:53] <jqueryius> Can anyone see what it is?
[00:22:30] <Arcarc> I want to save some SQL data into a jQuery variable? First off, do I need AJAX for this?
[00:22:44] <Arcarc> That first sentence wasn't intended to have a question mark
[00:23:01] <jqueryius> to send to the server or receive?
[00:23:08] <Arcarc> Receive
[00:23:09] <jqueryius> I wouldn't send raw SQL queries
[00:23:12] <jqueryius> ok good
[00:23:35] <jqueryius> Arcarc: what I'd do; using something like PHP access the database, return the data in JSON form
[00:24:44] <jqueryius> doesn't have to be ajax - like, in Symfony a few times, I have just injected the data I need into a variable... get the data in php, pass from controller to the view
[00:25:02] <Arcarc> Alright, sweet!
[00:25:03] <jqueryius> but if you are doing something asynchonously (ie. potentially after the initial page load) ajax is a good bet
[00:25:22] <Arcarc> Yeah, this is at the page load
[00:25:49] <Arcarc> But cool, then I don't have to tamper with a sixth language for this project
[00:27:01] <jqueryius> Are you using a framework like Symfony?
[00:27:12] <Arcarc> Well, no...
[00:29:02] <Arcarc> I suppose I'm needing something other than plain ol' jQuery to retrieve the SQL
[00:33:28] <Kartagis> hi
[00:33:58] <Kartagis> why would I get the error alert then success alert here? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/9vra47op/
[00:36:54] <Uhkis> jqueryius: you want element[0].files and element[0].files[0]
[00:37:18] <jqueryius> cheers Uhkis
[00:38:48] <jqueryius> If I have $x = $_POST['data']; in my PHP script
[00:38:58] <jqueryius> then how should I form the "data" part of $.ajax call?
[00:39:06] <jqueryius> data: ??
[00:40:01] <Uhkis> Kartagis: complete is not the same as success.
[00:40:18] <Kartagis> Uhkis: sorry, complete
[00:40:26] <Kartagis> I change the code a lot
[00:40:36] <jqueryius> is: ...............                data: { data: 'whatever' }                 okay?
[00:41:08] <Uhkis> jqueryius: yes
[00:41:48] <jqueryius> why shouldnt i stringify?
[00:42:47] <Uhkis> Kartagis: complete is ran after success or error
[00:43:51] <Uhkis> jqueryius: because data expects an object or query string
[01:00:43] <froginvasion> does anyone know a non-intrusive jquery plugin for checkboxes?
[01:00:57] <froginvasion> with non-intrusive I mean that it preserves changes from and to the original checkbox
[01:01:26] <froginvasion> i.e. i expect when you click a "custom" checkbox, that it also propagates the click event to the original checkbox
[01:01:29] <Cork> froginvasion: you can style checkboxes without the need of js
[01:02:36] <froginvasion> Cork: the problem still remains that I want to change the checkbox by for instance saying $("#check").prop("checked", false)
[01:02:45] <Cork> froginvasion: you can do that
[01:03:06] <froginvasion> How? do you have a good example of that.
[01:04:39] <Cork> give me a min
[01:04:40] <Uhkis> $('#check').on('change', function() { $('#original_check').val($(this).val()); }) should do it
[01:05:30] <froginvasion> does change event get triggered if you do .prop("checked", true);?
[01:05:31] <Uhkis> or prop('checked', $(this).prop('checked'))
[01:06:17] <Uhkis> you have to trigger('change'); manually
[01:08:22] <dimi1947> is there an easy way I can get the days/dates(7 in total) of the current week?
[01:09:30] <Cork> froginvasion: http://jsfiddle.net/tmvfpp2m/
[01:09:44] <Cork> the styling is very spartanian, but you can do about anything with it
[01:09:53] <Cork> (including images)
[01:10:18] <Cork> and this is just a normal input + label, so no special case for how code need to handle it
[01:11:05] <Cork> dimi1947: use the date object
[01:11:05] <froginvasion> yeah.. okay, cool Cork
[01:11:17] <Cork> dimi1947: (new date()).getDay()
[01:11:19] <froginvasion> thanks, that's indeed pretty easy
[01:11:38] <froginvasion> dimi1947, you might consider moment.js for an easier date API, but essentially you can do with with what Cork says
[01:13:08] <e01> hi
[01:13:33] <e01> is there some event that is triggered when form submit is canceled
[01:13:49] <Cork> uh, canceled??
[01:13:52] <Uhkis> what do you mean submit is canceled?
[01:14:04] <hamsies> im trying to install fancybox for a gallery, http://tocmo0nlord.mooo.com:9013/page/gallery any idea where i went wrong?
[01:14:19] <Cork> e01: if you mean when the browser wait for the response from the server, then no the page is already unloaded
[01:14:42] <e01> Cork: no is not
[01:15:09] <e01> such behavior is for example user click submit and after while do [Esc] or stop button
[01:15:24] <Cork> there isn't any communication to the page about that no
[01:15:49] <Cork> it would have been something like an event on window
[01:15:54] <Cork> and there isn't anything like that
[01:16:24] <e01> nice :D
[01:16:35] <dimi1947> @cork...getDay gives me the current day...I want all the seven days of the current week
[01:16:37] <e01> i wish SEO warlords to not communicate with clients :D
[01:17:03] <Cork> dimi1947: uh, you mean like a translation between the number and the name?
[01:17:55] <Cork> dimi1947: cause if that is what you mean; then no there isn't anything like that in the dom api
[01:18:01] <dimi1947> I want the 7 days of the week and their dates(and their name) of the current week
[01:18:17] <Cork> there isn't anything like that
[01:18:17] <Uhkis> Cork: i think he means ie. 13-19.4. for this week
[01:18:38] <Cork> you can get that by modifying a date object
[01:18:49] <Cork> but no there isn't a lookup method
[01:19:05] <dimi1947> no I do not mean only the start/end of the week...I want also the dates between
[01:19:15] <Cork> that is the same thing
[01:19:21] <Cork> create a now object
[01:19:26] <Cork> get what getDay() gives
[01:19:34] <dimi1947> ok
[01:19:38] <dimi1947> then...
[01:19:50] <Cork> create a new object (or modify the now object) by the amount for the direction you want
[01:19:57] <Cork> and check what getDate() gives you
[01:20:14] <Uhkis> hamsies: can't think of anything else than your jquery is too new for the plugin
[01:21:13] <dimi1947> the only problem is that there is not a  method for adding.subtracting days
[01:21:54] <dimi1947> Probably I will have to write my own function for that
[01:22:55] <Cork> hamsies: i would add a script section after the jquery-latest.min.js loading, and make sure it is the same jquery instance you have after a full page load
[01:23:23] <hamsies> how would i do this?
[01:23:29] <Cork> hamsies: i have a sneaking suspicion you get an additional jquery loading
[01:24:02] <Cork> <script>jQuery.fn.tester = 'i was here';</script>
[01:24:18] <Cork> and then in the console after a full page load jQuery.fn.test === 'i was here';
[01:24:25] <Cork> *tester
[01:24:38] <hamsies> okie ill add that at the end
[01:24:41] <Cork> no
[01:24:52] <Cork> make sure to add it directly after loading the jquery
[01:24:56] <Cork> else you moot the test
[01:25:23] <Uhkis> yup, #185 includes another jquery
[01:25:47] <Cork> you have those combinations (afa41eb and c68736a) and it is kinda messy to make sure things doesn't come from there
[01:27:43] <hamsies> let me remove them
[01:27:45] <hamsies> to seeee
[01:31:07] <hamsies> hmm i have no access to that portion of the script
[01:31:51] <Uhkis> remove the first jquery include and move the fancybox include just before your inline script
[01:32:57] <hamsies> remove line 35
[01:34:17] <hamsies> whats an inline script?
[01:34:44] <hamsies> sorry i REALLY have no idea on what im doing. im not into code at all
[01:34:59] * hamsies researches
[01:36:20] <hamsies> Uhkis, i will save you comments and fix it in the morning. thank you
[01:36:31] <Uhkis> wait
[01:36:44] <hamsies> yap
[01:37:00] <Uhkis> hamsies: now more #36 to #188
[01:37:06] <hamsies> sweet
[01:38:12] <hamsies> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[01:38:14] <hamsies> IT WORKSSSSS
[01:38:32] <Uhkis> :-)
[01:38:41] <hamsies> Uhkis, whats your paypal ill get you a coffee
[01:38:47] <Uhkis> no need :D
[01:38:57] <hamsies> french fries?
[01:39:15] <hamsies> this is soooo awesome
[01:39:27] <hamsies> ive been looking for a gallery for the last week!
[01:39:37] <hamsies> 7 days flipping around all over the place. thank you
[01:40:06] <Uhkis> np, that's what we're here for. also, a lot of credit to Cork for busting the double jquery
[01:40:31] <Uhkis> you can get him a coffee!
[01:41:10] <hamsies> Cork, paypal! for coffee
[01:41:23] <Cork> heh... hamsies a thank you is enough
[01:41:32] <hamsies> thank you for your help
[01:42:14] <Cork> hamsies: i'm doing this for my own sake, it helps me by exposing me to problems i would normally not experience otherwise
[01:49:55] <hamsies> Cork, good! now we know that odoo contains a script that causing a double call for jquery :P
[01:50:04] * hamsies writes it down
[01:50:21] <Cork> ya, and this is why i tell plugin writes to never do that...
[01:50:48] <Cork> *writers
[01:51:13] <Cork> (i've had quite the argument about it too...)
[01:53:14] <Uhkis> *odoo aggregates scripts
[01:54:01] <Cork> ah
[02:00:18] <froginvasion> Cork are you still there?
[02:00:38] <Cork> froginvasion: if you have a question just, ask it, no need to direct it at a specific person
[02:00:58] <froginvasion> well its related to the snippet you made earlier
[02:01:29] <froginvasion> I found a snippet similar that uses fontawesome
[02:01:30] <froginvasion> http://jsfiddle.net/tmvfpp2m/
[02:01:47] <froginvasion> but what do I do when the label is not right after it?
[02:01:58] <froginvasion> For instance, it is in a table, and the label is in another td
[02:02:22] <froginvasion> I can put an empty label after it to force the checkbox to show, however: you cannot click on it anymore
[02:02:24] <Cork> froginvasion: you always have to have one label directly after
[02:02:38] <Cork> froginvasion: though there is nothing preventing you from having multiple labels :)
[02:03:22] <Cork> froginvasion: http://jsfiddle.net/tmvfpp2m/1/
[02:05:58] <froginvasion2> nvm I found it.
[02:06:48] <froginvasion> wohoo
[02:07:53] <Cork> guess you missed my response
[02:07:56] <Cork> froginvasion: http://jsfiddle.net/tmvfpp2m/1/
[02:08:21] <froginvasion> thanks
[02:08:49] <froginvasion> indeed that's how i did it
[02:09:33] <froginvasion> is there a way to still show checkboxes that do not have a label after them?
[02:09:40] <Cork> no
[02:09:47] <Cork> cause you can't style the <input>
[02:09:55] <Cork> the label is what becomes the checkbox
[02:10:03] <Cork> (the :before selector)
[02:10:38] <Cork> froginvasion: you can limit the effect to only checkboxes with a specific class if you like
[02:10:51] <froginvasion> hm, yeah
[02:10:52] <Cork> or when they're inside a specific element or something like that
[02:11:04] <froginvasion> I thought that would be how to do it indeed
[02:19:31] <shwaiil> Q: using .ajax get method, to get some `html data` from url, how to select a given `#element` ? I see the html but when I try to $(result).find('#foobar') it doesn't work. I wonder why ? Thank you!
[02:19:46] <shwaiil> I'm also trying the .load method
[02:20:05] <Cork> shwaiil: is the html you get a partial, meaning without html and body?
[02:20:12] <shwaiil> $("#result").load("external.html", fn() { ...  });
[02:20:19] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for looking! it's with html and body
[02:20:42] <Cork> shwaiil: if at all possible you should only send partials as response to ajax
[02:20:48] <shwaiil> Cork: but I can use partials, because this is actually a angular project, but the client requested being able to load nodes from this site
[02:20:56] <Cork> cause dom fragments can't include those anyway
[02:21:03] <shwaiil> Cork: I see. What if not ? Is there a way ?
[02:21:06] <Cork> so you will have to rely on error correction to strip them away
[02:21:27] <shwaiil> I think partials is a great solution
[02:21:35] <Cork> shwaiil: .load already have code to handler that
[02:21:43] <Cork> but, ya you should try to avoid it
[02:21:58] <shwaiil> Is there a place where I can read about this, and why partials instead of loading the full html ? to show to them. I've suggested having an api but they refused
[02:22:16] <shwaiil> Cork: to handle it ? Ok, I'm checking the docs but without success
[02:22:26] <Cork> shwaiil: the reason why you should do this is quite simple
[02:22:32] <shwaiil> I mean, there is $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" );
[02:22:32] <Cork> you load html into the current page
[02:22:33] <shwaiil> sorry
[02:22:45] <Cork> so you already have a <html> and <body>
[02:22:54] <Cork> and you can't have html and body inside a body
[02:23:00] <Cork> and hence you shouldn't send it
[02:23:12] <Cork> that said what you just sent is what i talked about
[02:23:37] <Cork> it will create a fragment give it the full html, let the error correction strip out the invalid things
[02:23:44] <Cork> and try to find the real element you search for
[02:23:48] <shwaiil> Cork: makes a lot of sense to me.
[02:24:15] <shwaiil> What do you mean with the error correction strip out the invalid things ?
[02:24:24] <shwaiil> There's a method for that ?
[02:24:30] <Cork> shwaiil: it creates an element inject the full html page
[02:24:55] <Cork> and the browsers html parser will just throw out the invalid <html><head></head><body> sections
[02:25:09] <Cork> as it can't do anything with this
[02:25:26] <Cork> the result is a somewhat unstable dom structure
[02:25:34] <Cork> and it then tries to find the element you look for
[02:26:09] <Cork> (relying on error correction is something you normally want to avoid)
[02:26:14] <shwaiil> Ok : ) Partials is the way to go. I still want them to be a bit more sane and stick with an api. Let's hope.
[02:26:44] <Cork> shwaiil: if you have server side scripting just pluck out the part you want into a separate request url
[02:26:51] <Cork> and then include it in the normal html if you need it there
[02:27:07] <Cork> that is by far the best solution (as it also saves band width)
[02:39:14] <froginvasion> How can I make sure checkboxes as labels do not move around? They kind of glitch with HTML
[02:39:32] <Cork> move around?
[02:39:36] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[02:39:51] <froginvasion> they don't stay in place, when you check or uncheck them, they move slightly
[02:40:19] <Cork> froginvasion: if you use the styling we fiddled with before it could be cause of the content: " ";
[02:40:43] <Cork> you could try setting the content to the same and change color: transparent instead
[02:41:08] <Cork> what happens is that text alignment (vertical align) is fiddling with things
[02:41:35] <Cork> you could also try something like vertical-align: middle;
[02:42:05] <shwaiil> Cork:  once again, thank you for your attention! You're always helping, you need to share your paypal at some point for donations!
[02:42:23] <froginvasion> Cork, is that from the label or the input?
[02:42:41] <Cork> froginvasion: its from "text" and inline elements in general
[02:42:56] <Cork> the browser tries to put different characters "in line" with each other
[02:43:11] <Cork> and ya, that causes the border around them to jiggle around
[02:43:39] <Cork> it is the one rather big-ish problem with using text as icons
[02:44:44] <froginvasion> Ok, thanks for the info :)
[03:16:01] <Kartagis> hi
[03:17:19] <Kartagis> I'm working on parsing a json fetched. is it wise to create divs and whatnot beforehand, or do it with jquery?
[03:17:40] <Kartagis> I assume the latter, but I wanted to ask you guys
[03:18:02] <Cork> Kartagis: uh, parsing json or building dom from the json?
[03:18:42] <Kartagis> Cork: outputting results from json
[03:18:56] <Kartagis> after running in a loop
[03:19:24] <Kartagis> I guess that counts as 'building DOM'
[03:19:33] <Cork> Kartagis: if you need to create a simple element structure (like single elements) sure do it with jquery
[03:19:50] <Cork> Kartagis: if you need to use anything more complex you should look into using templates
[03:20:06] <Cork> cause that amount of html inside the js is messy and hard to maintain
[03:20:07] <Kartagis> Cork: I'm going to be using mustache
[03:20:17] <Cork> well there you go :)
[03:20:36] <Cork> store the template in a <script> tag and you should be set
[03:20:38] <Kartagis> but I feel I have to create the fields beforehand
[03:20:50] <Cork> <script type="text/template">
[03:20:55] <Kartagis> divs*
[03:21:04] <Cork> you don't
[03:21:27] <Kartagis> wow
[03:21:53] <Kartagis> without mustache, I have to create them right?
[03:22:36] <Cork> not really
[03:22:52] <Cork> you can use the <script> solution then too
[03:22:57] <Cork> you just don't have the scription options
[03:48:35] <micalm> Hi guys
[03:48:37] <micalm> http://hastebin.com/cabacequva.html
[03:48:41] <micalm> I have HTML/JS like this
[03:49:06] <micalm> Can't figure out how to add classes to the li's
[03:49:15] <micalm> Sorry for the phpish junk
[03:49:31] <toomus> HI. How to join two JSON objects? Eg. {key1: 'a', key2: 'b'} with {key1: 'c'} => {key1: 'c', key2: 'b'}??
[03:51:56] <micalm> toomus: .concat?
[03:52:51] <Uhkis> micalm: you create duplicate id's, fix the html first
[03:54:01] <Uhkis> micalm: use a class for multiple elements
[03:59:59] <toomus> micalm: i can;t find concat for JSON. There is only for array.
[04:02:40] <toomus> OK I found solution: $.extend({key1: 'a', key2: 'b'},{key1: 'c'}); => {key1: "c", key2: "b"}
[04:11:04] <micalm> Uhkis: didn't change nuffin
[04:46:29] <igyiguygyu> What's the problem with this little thing? https://jsfiddle.net/b3utc5ta/ It works if there is an entry in db, if there is not, it just doesnt put any text
[04:46:34] <igyiguygyu> comes out empty
[04:49:25] <Cork> igyiguygyu: you want $().data() !== undefined
[04:49:30] <Cork> not .length
[04:49:40] <Cork> if there isn't anything in the data object your current code will crash
[04:49:55] <Cork> TypeError: $(...).data(...) is undefined
[04:50:25] <igyiguygyu> well i am using data attributes on a to echo from db
[04:50:54] <igyiguygyu> I have other functions with .length and it works with either empty field or filled
[04:51:09] <Cork> yes, but if there isn't a "workdescription1" on there you will crash
[04:51:44] <Cork> actually, check your browser console it should show tehre
[04:51:46] <Cork> *there
[04:52:16] <igyiguygyu> nop, nothing shows up
[04:52:22] <igyiguygyu> code isn't crashing
[04:52:52] <Cork> well that is the only suggestion i can give without context
[04:53:20] <igyiguygyu> Here's a bigger picture
[04:53:21] <igyiguygyu> https://jsfiddle.net/b3utc5ta/1/
[04:53:38] <Cork> i need the html it works with too
[04:53:45] <igyiguygyu> everything else works but not sure why it isn't adding my predefined text if there is no entry in db
[04:54:21] <MrTopless> Hi is there a way to prevent link submission? For example link is passed, but server not getting the request and then you pass all the url params to jquery and ajax post it to server to get only what you need to to releoad all the page.
[04:54:42] <randomguy1> igyiguygyu: is this similar? https://jsfiddle.net/b3utc5ta/2/
[04:54:50] <MrTopless> no to reload all the page*
[04:54:53] <MrTopless> not*
[04:55:26] <Cork> MrTopless: uh, you can prevent the browser from following the link with event.preventDefault() if that's what you mean
[04:56:53] <igyiguygyu> randomguy1: that seems to work, am i blind or it's the exact same code from my paste
[04:56:58] <igyiguygyu> except the html
[04:57:28] <randomguy1> yeah, i changed the (this) to be the class i'm looking up
[04:57:32] <randomguy1> but pretty much the same thing
[04:57:44] <igyiguygyu> here's with the html - https://jsfiddle.net/b3utc5ta/3/
[04:58:15] <Cork> ugg, no thats php not html
[04:58:33] <MrTopless> for example I now on $(a).click(function(e){ e.preventDefault() var dataObject = deparam($(this).attr('href').substring(1)); $.post('same_url?mode=serv', { pagination: dataObject }, function(data){ $('#results-container').html(data.results); ... as well i update pagination } ) }; But the link is not passed to Bot in php I read both get and post. In case bot would decide to use the link no directly from server.
[04:58:54] <Cork> MrTopless: don't post blobs of code in the channel, make a fiddle
[04:59:08] <Cork> its close to impossible to read it like that
[04:59:16] <igyiguygyu> well yeah php, but it just illustrates the problem better
[04:59:59] <igyiguygyu> everything else works perfectly fine
[05:00:00] <Cork> no it doesn't
[05:00:10] <Cork> what is needed is to see the html js works with
[05:00:18] <Cork> as it is where you have the problem
[05:00:27] <Cork> looking at the php doesn't tell you that
[05:00:29] <MrTopless> in php I isset($_GET['page'])?$_GET['page']:(isset($_POST['page'])?$_POST['page']:1);
[05:00:58] <MrTopless> Cork, I have no malfunctions
[05:01:30] <MrTopless> Cork, its more of the theoretical question is it possible, if it is how should I do it. Because ajax pagination is smooth, but google bot doesn't read it.
[05:01:48] <VanReyes> Hi, I got some issue here I hope someone can help. I have a form and inside the form has 3 checkbox and 1 inputbox. I want if I check the 3 checkbox, it would result on the inputbox 123. So 1st checkbox = 1, 2nd checkbox = 2, 3rd checkbox = 3. and I want to uncheck 2nd checkbox so inputbox will now have 13(2 was removed). I tried str.replace but it doesn't work.
[05:01:52] <MrTopless> But I want to have smooth pagination and google bot to read all the records in the database.
[05:02:01] <Cork> MrTopless: even the more reason not to ask ppl to parse wrapping blobs of code
[05:02:25] <Cork> VanReyes: could you separate the question from the backstory please?
[05:03:04] <MrTopless> Cork, but by showing this code, I present with my current state, I don't want you to analyse this code, but I want you to see what I am at. And that now I am at the crossroad of decission and looking for advice.
[05:03:33] <Cork> MrTopless: ok, if you don't want ppl to see or understand what code you use, why did you at all post it?
[05:03:42] <VanReyes> I send a snippet. for a while
[05:03:51] <Cork> it is utterly unreadable to post long wrapping lines
[05:04:17] <Cork> MrTopless: you're free to ask, don't expect anyone to answer though
[05:05:18] <MrTopless> Cork, tell that I already know how to prevent default action of input. And to show how I am parsing params from url in the href attribute. So that I am looking for something more then this. Something which would allow bot and user to see url. But wouldn't allow browser to make default http request.
[05:05:34] <MrTopless> to tell*
[05:05:49] <VanReyes> cork: nevermind, I'll just try to solve it again with my own.
[05:05:52] <VanReyes> Thank you.
[05:23:37] <toomus> Hey, how to stop function execution, and wait for other function to return?
[05:24:47] <Cork> toomus: you can't
[05:25:03] <Cork> toomus: js is single threaded, if you stop a function nothing else will execute
[05:25:07] <Cork> the browser will just hang
[05:25:15] <toomus> eg. function iterate through json object with variable number of items, and for each iteam is calling async function
[05:25:29] <Cork> ya, you need to make the loop async
[05:25:34] <Cork> meaning not use a for loop
[05:25:38] <toomus> and should stop iteration until async function return
[05:25:45] <Cork> but instead use a function that grabs the next step in the loop
[05:25:56] <Cork> and have a callback from the async call do the next step
[05:26:19] <Cork> toomus: es6 has generators, but you can't use that yet
[05:26:27] <sacho> toomus, there's various schemes that let you orchestrate asynchronous control flow - csp, promises, generators.
[05:26:42] <toomus> how about jquery $.when() function?
[05:26:55] <Cork> toomus: you can't pause the loop with it
[05:27:02] <Cork> you have to change how you do the looping
[05:27:33] <toomus> I just iterate through json object with $.each()
[05:27:51] <Cork> toomus: if it is ok to loop the json call all the async functions
[05:27:55] <Kartagis> if I have something like {"nodes":[{"node":{"field_resim":{, do I need to use nodes or node in the loop?
[05:28:06] <Cork> then when the loop ends start handling the results, you can use $.each
[05:28:26] <Cork> toomus: but $.each or for loop or anything the like has to end before the async callback can fire at all
[05:29:18] <Cork> Kartagis: data.nodes <loop here> <step object>.node.field_resim
[05:34:48] <toomus> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/ny5nq55a/
[05:37:06] <toomus> Cork: If I have to restore more than one chat window, second gets wrong offset because it is created before first is complete.
[05:41:39] <feathersanddown> Hi!, I'm looking for a slider image gallery, but not for images, for a whole div content, any suggestion ?
[05:42:30] <Cork> toomus: ya, you have to use an itteration function instead of the each loop
[05:42:37] <Cork> toomus: then call that function to start the loop
[05:42:54] <Cork> toomus: and in the success callback in $.ajax call the function again to trigger the next step
[05:43:04] <Cork> you can't use a classic loop
[05:43:22] <Cork> feathersanddown: *slideshow not slider
[05:43:25] <toomus> sounds great, any sugestion?
[05:43:34] <Cork> uh... i just gave you that one...
[05:44:03] <toomus> I mean what oher iteration function you mean?
[05:44:17] <Cork> you create a function that takes the index as an argument
[05:44:41] <Cork> this function makes the ajax call and call it self inside the success callback with index + 1 as argument
[05:44:50] <toomus> Ahhhhhh ok
[05:45:07] <Cork> don't forget an if check before the ajax to check when you should stop looping
[05:46:21] <feathersanddown> Cork: aahh sorry,  will google again :)
[05:46:46] <Cork> feathersanddown: a slider is a form element :)
[05:46:49] <toomus> Cork: is it possible to access json by index?
[05:46:56] <Cork> ?mdn input slider
[05:46:57] <b-ot> Cork: <input> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[05:47:28] <Cork> toomus: json is a string, when you've parsed it you have javascript structures
[05:47:34] <Cork> json doesn't tell what structure you have
[05:47:45] <Cork> just that it was delivered as a string
[05:48:08] <Cork> toomus: are you talking about arrays or objects?
[05:48:58] <Kartagis> Cork: for (var i in data.nodes) { var image=data.nodes[i].node.field_resim.src... ; } ?
[05:49:19] <Cork> Kartagis: no, don't ever use for in on an array
[05:49:21] <Cork> that is BAD
[05:49:28] <Cork> for in is for objects
[05:49:55] <Cork> either use the for(;;) syntax or use array.forEach or $.each
[05:49:58] <toomus> Cork: pure JSON
[05:50:08] <Kartagis> oh, so this is an array
[05:50:08] <Cork> toomus: that means nothing
[05:50:21] <Cork> "" <-- this is json
[05:50:28] <Cork> "true" this is also json
[05:50:33] <Cork> "{}" this is json
[05:50:38] <Cork> "[]" this is json
[05:50:40] <Cork> and so on
[05:50:42] <toomus> Cork: {key1: 'val1', key2: 'val2', key3: 'val3'......}
[05:50:47] <Cork> ok so an object
[05:51:12] <Cork> that does complicate things a bit
[05:51:33] <Kartagis> are you talking to me or toomus?
[05:51:38] <toomus> Cork: hehehe this is why Im here
[05:51:51] <Cork> Kartagis: until the "toomus:" i talked with you
[05:52:10] <Cork> toomus: do you need ie<9 support?
[05:52:11] <Kartagis> owkay
[05:52:18] <toomus> Cork: nope
[05:52:24] <Cork> ?mdn object.keys
[05:52:25] <b-ot> Cork: Object.keys() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[05:52:35] <Cork> use that array as the basis for the loop
[05:54:43] <cjohnson> and even if you did need ie<9 use es5-shim (you should use es5-shim anyway (and es6-shim too))
[05:55:14] <toomus> Cork: maybe first iterate through json object and create array of keys, and then iterate through that array?
[05:55:44] <cjohnson> there is not 100% es5 compliant browser so es5-shim helps in every environment
[05:55:45] <Cork> toomus: Object.keys(theObject) gives you an array of all the keys of that object
[05:55:50] <Cork> no need for the extra loop
[05:56:11] <toomus> Ah ok I see
[06:17:15] <hrusti_> I am writing plugin for user to include this http://jsfiddle.net/d33mzg6c/ to their page. First question is how to center my elements in inner-container div?
[06:18:13] <Cork> hrusti_: you mean http://jsfiddle.net/d33mzg6c/1/ ?
[06:19:09] <hrusti_> Cork: yes :) thanks..
[06:21:18] <hrusti_> Cork: next question.. how to adjust height/width like this plugin: http://preev.com
[06:22:20] <hrusti_> I want that it will fits inside all elements. So it could can be placed in navbar, in body etc.
[06:23:55] <hrusti_> I know my answer is not well defined but I dont really know how to ask it :)
[06:24:02] <Perseus0> hey I have this simple script for opening and closing a search bar https://jsfiddle.net/Perseus0/ev301gw7/ and it was working fine but now it doesn't behave as in the fiddle, once you click on  it, it  closes again.  Anyone have a clue why this is messed up?
[06:25:29] <Cork> hrusti_: http://jsfiddle.net/0g5rt7sn/
[06:26:24] <Cork> Perseus0: you bind two click handlers on the same button
[06:26:32] <Cork> one changing display and one animation it
[06:26:38] <Cork> are you sure you mean to have them like that?
[06:27:42] <Cork> Perseus0: https://jsfiddle.net/ev301gw7/1/
[06:28:54] <hrusti_> Cork: I dont know what you want to show with this example. If I type anything it change width to minimum? No number or text is in it?
[06:29:21] <Cork> hrusti_: set a min-width on the field if you want
[06:33:48] <hrusti_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/0g5rt7sn/1/ ok but input with doesnt change at all? I want to fit number length?
[06:34:04] <hrusti_> Like in my example
[06:34:20] <toomus> Cork: THX, it's work :)
[06:35:10] <Kartagis> Cork: why did you say bad for it?
[06:36:12] <Cork> js> var a = [1,2,3]; Array.prototype.opps = yes; var results = []; for(v in a) { results.push(v); }; print(JSON.stringify(results))
[06:36:15] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:36:27] <Cork> gah
[06:36:38] <Cork> js> var a = [1,2,3]; Array.prototype.opps = true; var results = []; for(v in a) { results.push(v); }; print(JSON.stringify(results))
[06:36:42] <b-ot> Cork: ["0","1","2","opps"]
[06:37:36] <Cork> hrusti_: js doesn't know the size of letters
[06:37:53] <Cork> hrusti_: you could copy the text into a separate element and then check for the size of that element afterwards
[06:38:02] <Cork> but that is basically what the script i gave you does
[06:40:42] <Cork> hrusti_: anyway if you didn't manage to get it working: http://jsfiddle.net/0g5rt7sn/2/
[06:42:26] <hrusti_> Cork: I think you didnt get it what I want. I want that input adjust width to content lentght
[06:42:50] <hrusti_> http://jsfiddle.net/d33mzg6c/1/
[06:42:52] <hrusti_> like this
[06:46:05] <Cork> hrusti_: that is exactly what i gave you
[06:46:37] <Cork> hrusti_: if you type in that input field it adjusts its width
[06:47:05] <Cork> ah... except i didn't check in chrome
[06:47:12] <Cork> and ... they don't support that :/
[06:47:22] <Kartagis> var image[i]=data.nodes[i].node.field_resim.src[i]; why is this giving me unexpected identifier [ ?
[06:47:26] <hrusti_> Cork: how? I tired with chrome and safari and input width is fixed?
[06:47:41] <Cork> hrusti_: ya, webkit doesn't support it
[06:47:55] <Cork> so you tested the one browser engine i didn't check :)
[06:48:59] <hrusti_> Cork: ok I thought I am blind :)
[06:49:18] <hrusti_> what browser did you tested? Mozilla?
[06:50:02] <Insomnia88_> Hi there! I have a small issue but I am not sure if it has to do mit jquery itself.. to make it short. My click event is fired after dom ready without any clicking or stuff... I am using the pre installed jquery of wordpress (1.11.0)
[06:50:20] <Insomnia88_> I also cannot reproduce it with jsfiddle or something-.-
[06:50:39] <Cork> hrusti_: http://jsfiddle.net/0g5rt7sn/5/
[06:51:03] <Cork> actually http://jsfiddle.net/0g5rt7sn/6/
[06:51:51] <hrusti_> Cork: great
[06:52:08] <hrusti_> it works like a charm :)
[06:52:08] <Cork> Insomnia88_: sounds like you're passing a function with () or something like that
[06:52:36] <Cork> hrusti_: it wiggles a little, and leftMax doesn't do that
[06:52:40] <Cork> but ya, it works
[06:53:47] <Insomnia88_> Well, I am not :) This is how it looks like in my code -> http://jsfiddle.net/mtzzoec6/ <- But in your position I would assume the same.. that's why I am here. I have not the slightes clue what is happening
[06:59:52] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/L8d9qbwt/ what's wrong with the syntax?
[07:03:28] <hrusti_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/0g5rt7sn/7/ why if I press delete width increase?
[07:04:16] <NoiseEee> hrusti_: because your code explicitly tells it to do so?!
[07:05:06] <hrusti_> NoiseEee: I know. So I have to check if button pressed is delete decrease it?
[07:05:24] <NoiseEee> hrusti_: if that's the behaviour you want...
[07:05:42] <NoiseEee> hrusti_: every time you hit any key, it increases (over and over), is that what you want?
[07:05:56] <NoiseEee> the fun part about programming is that you get to decide how you want things to be.
[07:05:58] <hrusti_> no I want it to fit content
[07:06:18] <hrusti_> NoiseEee: the hardest thing, yes :)
[07:08:31] <Perseus0> cork thanks, it works the same though... i have something going on that's screwing me that function
[07:08:51] <hrusti_> I exactly want if I change font-size input width adjust.. and then input/delete anything also..
[07:09:23] <amikrop> Hi. I use .on('change', function () {...) but it works only for the default elements and not the ones dynamically created
[07:09:43] <Cork> amikrop: look at delegation
[07:09:47] <Cork> ?api delegate
[07:09:47] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:10:05] <Cork> amikrop: you can do it with .on, but you need to use a different syntax
[07:10:42] <amikrop> Cork: I should use the .on('change': function () {}); syntax?
[07:10:47] <Cork> no
[07:10:56] <Cork> like i said you need the delegate syntax
[07:11:25] <Cork> amikrop: the syntax you currently use select all the elements that matches the selector
[07:11:33] <Cork> amikrop: and then binds event handlers to each of them
[07:11:47] <Cork> amikrop: what you need to do is bind a delegated event handler to a parent
[07:12:06] <Cork> the link i gave you explains how it works
[07:12:56] <amikrop> Cork: ('#container').on('change', '.child', function () {}); ?
[07:13:10] <Cork> yup
[07:13:17] <amikrop> ok thx
[07:27:51] <Perseus0> cork i had replicated my path to my js file , fml that's why it was acting weird

[08:06:16] <starsinc> Is there a reason why Jquery 2.1.0 doesn't work with jquery ui?
[08:11:33] <starsinc> Nvm.
[08:24:45] <jeffreylevesque> how can i adjust `value.match(/^(0|[1-9][0-9]*).\d+$/)` to allow decimals without a preceeding 0?
[08:24:50] <jeffreylevesque> i have to adjust `(0|[1-9][0-9]*)` portion
[08:24:53] <jeffreylevesque> another or case
[08:25:01] <jeffreylevesque> like a null
[08:31:39] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: So you want to allow 0.323 or .213 or 2.321 or 21312312.232321123?
[08:33:17] <starsinc> Hey Bill, same guy from yesterday with the slide toggle
[08:34:43] <starsinc> I got the jquery working fine in the fiddle, but when I moved it over to my local site, for some reason my jquery/html gets reset (I'm using foundation/wordpress).
[08:35:42] <BillCriswell> starsinc: Not sure what you mean by reset.
[08:37:05] <starsinc> like i see the div sliding out, but then it just disappears and my html goes back to normal without a refresh happening
[08:38:55] <BillCriswell> starsinc: What element are you clicking to trigger the transition?
[08:40:00] <starsinc> its an anchor link
[08:40:22] <BillCriswell> ok, so i'm thinking you just need to do event.preventDefault()
[08:40:49] <BillCriswell> so like $('.foo').on('click', function (event) { event.preventDefault(); /* Toggle stuff */ });
[08:40:54] <starsinc> !
[08:41:01] <starsinc> Worked.
[08:41:12] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[08:42:16] <starsinc> so event.preventDefault() just prevents the click from registering/
[08:45:21] * wwwBUKOLAYcom :(
[08:46:00] <starsinc> BillCriswell thanks a bunch!
[08:46:39] <BillCriswell> starsinc: The click still happens, but it keeps the browser from going to that link.
[08:50:58] <Zeranoe> If I change some form data with jquery, will that changed data be used when the user hits submit?
[08:51:59] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: Yes.
[08:57:36] <DeoSama> Does anyone have any idea why my ajax jsonp call is running twice?
[08:57:59] <DeoSama> I've looked over the code multiple times, and I can't see any reason why it would run twice
[08:58:03] <DeoSama> Is this a common thing?
[08:58:44] <robertmaxrees> did you share the code out?
[08:58:51] <DeoSama> one sec
[08:58:53] <DeoSama> I'll paste it
[08:58:55] <Omar-> DeoSama it shouldn't. maybe duplicate event attached
[08:59:00] <Omar-> dont paste it here
[08:59:05] <DeoSama> no no
[08:59:08] <Omar-> haha
[08:59:09] <Omar-> ok
[09:00:38] <DeoSama> http://pastebin.com/1Jxx534D
[09:01:08] <DeoSama> at the very bottom you'll see i have a different button that uses this code
[09:01:29] <DeoSama> it shouldn't matter that i'm using a class as an identifier, right?
[09:01:40] <DeoSama> i do have 2 buttons on the page with the class "confirmOrder"
[09:01:53] <DeoSama> I'm so lost... haha
[09:02:00] <DeoSama> I've been trying to figure this out for ~3 hours
[09:03:17] <Omar-> jQuery('#verify_contactInfo').on('click', function () { last three lines
[09:03:36] <DeoSama> that's what is causing a double submit?
[09:03:47] <DeoSama> shouldn't that just run the confirmOrder code once?
[09:03:48] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: yes sir.  I would like a regex that validates - 0.323 or .213 or 2.321 or 21312312.232321123
[09:04:05] <Omar-> is #verfiy_contacInfo parent of .confirmOrder?
[09:04:12] <DeoSama> no
[09:04:21] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Is the decimal optional?
[09:04:30] <jeffreylevesque> currently `value.match(/^(0|[1-9][0-9]*).\d+$/)` validates: 0.324, 2.3242, 323432.342
[09:04:37] <DeoSama> i used to have .confirmOrder an ID, but my boss wanted the button above the form
[09:04:41] <jeffreylevesque> the decimal can only occur once
[09:04:44] <DeoSama> so i just made it a class, instead of an id
[09:04:51] <BillCriswell> right, but does it have to occur
[09:05:07] <jeffreylevesque> yea
[09:05:16] <jeffreylevesque> this is to validate for a float
[09:05:50] <Omar-> DeoSama can you also share a simplified html markup?
[09:05:51] <jeffreylevesque> and i have the float validation contained within an if statement, then I have an else if statement that validates strictly for int
[09:05:59] <BillCriswell> ^/\d*\.\d+$/ jeffreylevesque ?
[09:06:03] <Omar-> DeoSama i'm afraid that click event is bubbling up
[09:06:12] <DeoSama> omar, sure, i'll try to do it quick
[09:06:49] <Omar-> or is confirmorder is submit button? DeoSama
[09:06:54] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: /^\d*\.\d+$/.test('.0') is working for my tests.
[09:07:25] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: but that allows 00.34
[09:07:40] <DeoSama> omar-, <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="btn btn-primary confirmOrder">Submit Order</a>
[09:07:45] <jeffreylevesque> i prefer not having double 0's
[09:08:02] <jeffreylevesque> which is why my almost working attempt was `match(/^(0|[1-9][0-9]*).\d+$/)`
[09:09:42] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: What's wrong with something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/3885844/191226
[09:10:00] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: doesn't that allow hexs?
[09:10:22] <Omar-> DeoSama pls show us your html
[09:10:45] <DeoSama> omar- i'm simplifying it
[09:10:46] <Omar-> the code you shared should run once
[09:10:50] <Omar-> thanks DeoSama
[09:11:46] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Yes.
[09:12:09] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: i was hoping to not validate hexs, or have hexs as invalid
[09:12:27] <jeffreylevesque> can my regex be tweeked to add another or case
[09:12:35] <DeoSama> omar- i know this is messy... :(
[09:12:36] <DeoSama> http://pastebin.com/LgSvYHFL
[09:12:58] <jeffreylevesque> make an optional null case in `(0|[1-9][0-9]*)`
[09:13:05] <jeffreylevesque> from `match(/^(0|[1-9][0-9]*).\d+$/)`
[09:13:18] <jeffreylevesque> `match(/^(null|0|[1-9][0-9]*).\d+$/)`
[09:13:21] <DeoSama> basically, i have 2 different forms: one is for contacting the user if we're not in their area, the 2nd is to show a summary of their order
[09:13:32] <jeffreylevesque> but, replace null with the equivalent regex logic
[09:13:35] <DeoSama> both use the same confirm button
[09:14:17] <fracture_pandeya> hello, i have got the href value of an anchor link, how can i get the id of it
[09:14:21] <jeffreylevesque> rather `((null|0)|[1-9][0-9]*)`
[09:14:29] <jeffreylevesque> something like that

[09:16:18] <Uhkis> finally
[09:16:21] <Kartagis> ban his ass
[09:16:31] <robertmaxrees> already being done ;)
[09:16:52] <Kartagis> /ban wwwBUKOLAYcom
[09:17:02] <robertmaxrees> he's quieted now ;)
[09:17:29] <fracture_pandeya> ?
[09:17:53] <fracture_pandeya> whats going on
[09:18:04] <Omar-> DeoSama hmmmm do you have another .confirmOrder element in DOM?
[09:18:20] <DeoSama> omar- there are 2
[09:18:28] <Uhkis> fracture_pandeya: someone decided irc is good place to advertise his site
[09:18:32] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: What about: function valid (s) { return typeof +s === 'number' && s.slice(0, 2).toLowerCase() !== '0x'; }
[09:18:38] <fracture_pandeya> lol
[09:18:51] <fracture_pandeya> must be a dumbass, seriously
[09:19:21] <Omar-> DeoSama that's why then. $(".confrimOrder").trigger("click") will run on all elements with class confirmOrder
[09:19:30] <Kartagis> unfortunately, he's a Turk
[09:19:48] <Uhkis> fracture_pandeya: and to your question $(a[href=yourhref]).attr('id');
[09:19:54] <DeoSama> omar- so I'd have to give them each an ID, and then trigger a function?
[09:20:24] <Omar-> DeoSama a unique selector, whether an ID or a class confirmOrderBtn
[09:20:28] <decx> i cant even click the advertisment -.-
[09:20:40] <DeoSama> omar- awesome, thanks. I'll try that out.
[09:20:50] <Omar-> sure DeoSama good luck
[09:21:13] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/L8d9qbwt/1/ <--- is this syntactically valid?
[09:21:13] <fracture_pandeya> wo thanks
[09:22:02] <Kartagis> decx: because there wasn't any. he just nick-vertised
[09:22:18] <Kartagis> wow, I invented something
[09:22:24] <Omar-> fracture_pandeya or $(a[href=yourhref])[0].id
[09:22:31] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Yes.
[09:22:34] <decx> maybe they juts couldnt come up with a better name
[09:23:01] <Uhkis> decx: and just for the fun do empty /actions?
[09:23:02] <BillCriswell> I'm sure it's no Zombo.com
[09:23:11] <fracture_pandeya> Omar-  am trying that one
[09:23:20] <decx> doesnt hurt me
[09:23:25] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: yes what? yes you invented something or yes it's syntactically valid?
[09:23:37] <BillCriswell> syntactically valid
[09:23:57] <fracture_pandeya> Uhkis: I get an error > Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression

[09:24:19] <decx> nickvertisement, syntactically... what does that even mean
[09:24:20] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: assuming this {"nodes":[{"node":{"field_resim":{"src":"http://yayinevi.sabanciuniv.edu/sites/yayinevi.sabanciuniv.edu/files/styles/thumbnail/public/kitaplar/pr_01_6_max.jpg, still valid?
[09:24:23] <decx> fillibuster
[09:24:30] <Uhkis> fracture_pandeya: yeah, it's missing some quotes, $('a[href="yourhref"]').attr('id');
[09:24:39] <BillCriswell> decx: haha
[09:24:49] <Kartagis> decx: advertise through nick?
[09:25:14] <Kartagis> or the nick
[09:25:21] <decx> just assume everything i write is sarcasm
[09:25:22] <Uhkis> fracture_pandeya: try jQuery('a[href="' + href + '"]').attr('id');
[09:25:28] <decx> it'll be right more often than not
[09:25:54] <Uhkis> decx: you better disactivate it
[09:26:03] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: I dont believe you want to be doing src[i]
[09:26:04] * Kartagis just assumes everything decx writes is sarcasm
[09:26:07] <decx> haha disactivate good one
[09:26:18] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: no? why?
[09:26:37] <BillCriswell> src is a string.
[09:26:46] <Kartagis> me fail English? unpossible!
[09:27:02] <decx> attribute selectors are perfectly cromulent
[09:27:12] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: but it's still in the loop?
[09:27:28] <Kartagis> what do I want to do then BillCriswell?
[09:27:53] <Kartagis> decx: I believe you meant purrfect
[09:28:11] <decx> i certainly do not
[09:28:18] <decx> that would be a kitten calamity

[09:29:19] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: http://jsbin.com/vefibo/1/edit?html,js,output trying to do something like this?
[09:31:27] <BillCriswell> var images = data.nodes.map(function (node) { return node.node.field_resim.src; }); could also replace that for loop you have
[09:31:44] <Kartagis> riight
[09:31:46] <Kartagis> thanks
[09:32:00] <BillCriswell> lol was that a sarcastic "riight"?
[09:32:02] <Kartagis> I'll edit my fiddle
[09:32:04] <BillCriswell> and you're welcome
[09:32:09] <Kartagis> no it wasn't
[09:32:19] <BillCriswell> oh ok
[09:32:36] <decx> it wasnt?
[09:32:55] <decx> i don't know what'S what anymore, up is white, left is down

[09:33:09] <Kartagis> what's this .map BillCriswell?
[09:33:10] <Uhkis> decx: yes, peter
[09:33:21] <Kartagis> ?mdn map
[09:33:22] <b-ot> Kartagis: Array.prototype.map() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[09:33:32] <BillCriswell> There you go.
[09:33:44] <Uhkis> ?api .map
[09:33:44] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[09:33:47] <Uhkis> ?api .map()
[09:33:49] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[09:33:49] <decx> thanks uhkis, i was trying to remember where that was from ^^
[09:33:57] <Uhkis> ?api jQuery.map()
[09:33:57] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[09:34:03] <Uhkis> grr! :D
[09:34:10] <BillCriswell> I used native map for that, you might need to use jQuery's $.map depending on the browsers you need to support.
[09:34:25] <Uhkis> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[09:34:27] <Uhkis> there!
[09:34:42] <Uhkis> decx: if it's funny, it's probably family guy ;)
[09:34:48] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: actually I'll be using this in a cordova project
[09:35:05] <decx> well that's an outdated statement
[09:35:05] <BillCriswell> i hear ya
[09:35:21] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: how do you adapt this to my fiddle?
[09:35:31] <Uhkis> decx: as old as that reference!
[09:36:00] <decx> it's that old that it stopped being a reference and started becoming vernacular
[09:36:06] <Kartagis> I'll bbl
[09:36:16] <BillCriswell> You should be able to just put that code in the success callback since everything is named the same.
[09:36:25] <Kartagis> okay
[09:36:29] <BillCriswell> all i did was manually put your ajax data into a variable.
[09:36:38] <Kartagis> thank you
[09:36:39] <fracture_pandeya> what does "too much recursion" mean
[09:36:48] <decx> it's quite literal
[09:36:55] <decx> explaining it would be too much recursion
[09:36:58] <Kartagis> fracture_pandeya: means you're in deep shit
[09:37:09] <fracture_pandeya> am trying to scroll to a div jQuery('html, body').animate({scrollTop: jQuery("#" + tabid).offset().top-140});
[09:37:10] <robertmaxrees> fracture_pandeya you're calling a function from within itself.
[09:37:20] <Uhkis> fracture_pandeya: you're probably looping some function infinitely
[09:37:31] <fracture_pandeya> hm ok
[09:37:36] <fracture_pandeya> but
[09:37:37] <fracture_pandeya> um
[09:37:54] <decx> doesnt look like that would be the culprit tbh
[09:38:11] <BillCriswell> You probably want to get the offset().top once instead of in the scrollTop.
[09:38:43] <fracture_pandeya> decx: that is doing it on click
[09:38:47] <fracture_pandeya> and that error comes then
[09:39:36] <fracture_pandeya> offset().top once instead ?
[09:39:58] <BeWilled_> Hello can somebody help me? in this example I can drag the image left(with click and hold) with no problem, but when trying to move it right the background-position-x property suddently jumps to -20300202 and everything stops working
[09:40:06] <BeWilled_> https://jsfiddle.net/2bjd63x2/
[09:41:25] <fracture_pandeya> BillCriswell: what are you sayin?
[09:42:03] <navetz> hi, how can I found out where that's preventing my form from submitting is located?
[09:42:24] <fracture_pandeya> navetz: console, network tab
[09:42:31] <navetz> i am modifying a website and the search form doesn't submit, but it add's class "active" to the form. I'd like to change this to work by default behaviour
[09:42:38] <navetz> fracture_pandeya, thanks i'll take al ook
[09:42:57] <Uhkis> search your source for preventDefault
[09:43:34] <decx> BeWilled_:  it's going onto infinite when you drag to the left too
[09:43:40] <navetz> Uhkis, This is a wordpress install I'm modifying, there are lots of javascript files, I'm having a hard time finding the right one.
[09:44:04] <fracture_pandeya> navetz: is it a plugin, cf 7 ?
[09:44:10] <navetz> fracture_pandeya, what is the network tab suppose to show me? I don't see what's grabbing the event.
[09:45:02] <fracture_pandeya> which browser
[09:45:08] <navetz> fracture_pandeya, I don't think it's a plugin, but it's possible.
[09:45:10] <fracture_pandeya> keep it open
[09:45:12] <navetz> fracture_pandeya, browser is chrome
[09:45:18] <fracture_pandeya> keep it open and then submit
[09:45:59] <navetz> fracture_pandeya, the problem is the form doesn't submit. Some javascript is stopping it.
[09:46:36] <robertmaxrees> navetz you can look in your dev tools - most of the time it'll show you what's bound to that element.
[09:46:56] <BillCriswell> say what
[09:47:48] <robertmaxrees> chrome has an "event listeners" tab, and FF (at least dev edition) has a little flag next to elements with an event handler on it.
[09:49:22] <DasLumberJackYa> Say guys I need to have a button on my form to duplicate it and its current filled out values, catch is it has to be compaitable with rails. Any solutions besides manually creating everything?
[09:49:33] <robertmaxrees> oh, only dudes can answer this question apparently.
[09:49:35] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[09:49:39] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:49:40] <DasLumberJackYa> or gals
[09:49:45] <DasLumberJackYa> none the matter haha
[09:49:45] <fracture_pandeya> Error: Stack overflow wth ?
[09:50:08] <robertmaxrees> DasLumberJackYa what does rails have to do with it.
[09:50:20] <DasLumberJackYa> robertmaxrees: the names of thefields have to be correct
[09:50:29] <robertmaxrees> DasLumberJackYa are you trying to copy from one form to another in the browser?
[09:50:38] <DasLumberJackYa> robertmaxrees: i have nested fields that are dynamically added
[09:50:52] <robertmaxrees> but this is all in the browser, right?
[09:50:56] <fracture_pandeya> store it in a session
[09:51:11] <robertmaxrees> because there's https://api.jquery.com/clone/
[09:51:13] <DasLumberJackYa> No im trying to reduce data entry by duplicated forms or fields and then editing just a few, then saving all records
[09:51:17] <Kitsune^> Whats the best approach to detect if an element (with a class) enters the viewport so I can assign a 2nd class to animate it?
[09:51:25] <DasLumberJackYa> robertmaxrees: ill check out clone docs
[09:51:49] <adv_> i'm using console.log(target) and i'm getting [object Object], how can i see which object it is?
[09:52:57] <navetz> robertmaxrees, hum I see some things bound to the element but none of them are stopping form submittal
[09:53:08] <robertmaxrees> navetz anything returning false?
[09:53:12] <robertmaxrees> or anything weird like that?
[09:53:42] <Kitsune^> adv_: I thought there was a little triangle in front of it to expand it in the console
[09:53:47] <DasLumberJackYa> robertmaxrees: So baisically, I will hav eto clone the fields, programatically change all the names.
[09:54:04] <adv_> Kitsune^: no there's not
[09:55:03] <navetz> robertmaxrees, yes there is something returning false. I will test quickly
[09:55:16] <robertmaxrees> navetz that will prevent form submission then.
[09:57:34] <navetz> robertmaxrees, hum nvm, that even is bound to every element
[09:57:40] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[09:57:41] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:58:13] <robertmaxrees> is this an SPA of some kind?
[09:58:35] <navetz> robertmaxrees, I might be understanding this wrong, but this is the site: http://waratek.com.cp20.ezhostingserver.com/?s=test    The search bar at the top left works, but the search bar in the right sidebar doesn't. You can see the event listener I'm talking about
[09:59:03] <navetz> robertmaxrees, lineNumber: 1459
[09:59:58] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault(); on the button.
[10:01:32] <navetz> robertmaxrees, which line do you see that? I don't see it anywhere in that function
[10:02:38] <robertmaxrees> something about classItem.toggleClass(options.classAdd);
[10:02:41] <robertmaxrees> line after that.
[10:03:49] <navetz> ah I see, I will test thanks so much!
[10:06:04] <BeWilled_> decx, See for yourself, I just updated it to only swipe left https://jsfiddle.net/2bjd63x2/1/
[10:06:41] <decx> i wouldnt rely on getting your background position every mousemove
[10:06:46] <decx> you already keep track of x
[10:07:12] <BeWilled_> decx, so its a bug?
[10:07:46] <decx> i can't tell there are so many distractions ^^
[10:08:47] <BeWilled_> if both are moving the background left it works, but if I change the property from x-2 to x+2 it goes into infinite
[10:11:50] <navetz> robertmaxrees, The solution worked, thank you! How did you find that classItem.toggleClass(options.classAdd);
[10:12:00] <robertmaxrees> the firefox dev tools
[10:12:06] <navetz> robertmaxrees, I am usually pretty good at tracing but I don't see how you found that line of code
[10:12:15] <navetz> robertmaxrees, ah okay. I was using chrome, maybe I should try firefox
[10:12:37] <decx> BeWilled_: https://jsfiddle.net/decx/2bjd63x2/2/
[10:12:51] <decx> like i said, you already keep track of x, why not use that instead
[10:13:22] <decx> those lookups for the current background position only end in pain (as evident by the previous behaviour ;) )
[10:14:13] <MrTopless> Hey I get fancybox is not a function error, fancybox is loaded after jquery
[10:14:21] <robertmaxrees> no 404s or anything?
[10:14:27] <MrTopless> jquery 1,11,2 and fancybox 3.0.2
[10:14:29] <robertmaxrees> is jquery loaded more than once?
[10:15:01] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees>, don't know unless it is already minified inside fancybox min
[10:15:10] <robertmaxrees> check your page's source.
[10:15:15] <robertmaxrees> see if jquery is loaded more than once.
[10:15:17] <BeWilled_> decx, nice, why didn't I think og that /cry. My gratitude :)
[10:15:33] <decx> and cache your selectors
[10:15:38] <decx> it's maintenence hell
[10:16:27] <decx> also add mouseout to touchend and mouseup
[10:16:42] <decx> that prevents a sticky touch var when leaving the element
[10:16:49] <MrTopless> <robertmaxrees>, script src is included only once
[10:17:49] <robertmaxrees> MrTopless go to your console and try typing $.fn.jquery
[10:17:51] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[10:18:07] <BeWilled_> thanks decx, js is the trickiest language I've stumbled upon so far
[10:18:26] <MrTopless> "1.11.2"
[10:18:28] <Omar-> when window.location.href = url; is used, is it called "http" navigation?
[10:18:35] <MrTopless> robertmaxress, "1.11.2"
[10:18:47] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, "1.11.2"
[10:19:46] <MrTopless> and $.fn.fancybox is undefined
[10:20:01] <decx> i need to go back to monospace for irc, just spent 30 seconds trying to figure out why one line was longer than the other
[10:20:11] <robertmaxrees> MrTopless then something else is up.
[10:20:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the link you're using to load fancybox.
[10:21:08] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, its not public. Its inside custom cms admin after I update jquery
[10:21:17] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[10:21:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple-check to make sure jquery isn't getting loaded more than once, check your network tab to make sure everything is loading as you expect, etc.
[10:27:43] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, fixed it, seems like I've uploaded broken fancybox file
[10:28:04] <robertmaxrees> it's always something simple :)
[10:29:52] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, I have other problem with contextmenu, $('.thumb').on('contextmenu', function(e) { console.log(e.which) }); this doesn't return anything to console no matter how many times i right click on that <a class='thumbs'><img src="something"></a>
[10:30:14] <MrTopless> mousedown returns
[10:30:31] <MrTopless> but it as well triggers context menu
[10:30:46] <MrTopless>  e.preventPropogation(); does no effect
[10:31:11] <robertmaxrees> wait - are you trying to prevent right clicks?
[10:32:28] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, I'm trying to prevent contextmenu from poping out as I have custom contextmenu, but they are both showing up
[10:32:39] <decx> BeWilled_: if you run the new event.pageX againts the last one you get a smoother tracking and don't need the left/right check btw https://jsfiddle.net/decx/2bjd63x2/4/
[10:33:35] <robertmaxrees> MrTopless without seeing your code i have no idea then.  that should work.
[10:34:46] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, hold on I will fiddle it up.
[10:38:05] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having some issues with what should be a really simple form submit catch: http://jsfiddle.net/rjw2xbv0/ Any thoughts?
[10:38:35] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[10:39:02] <MrTopless> <robertmaxrees>, https://code.jquery.com/ui/
[10:39:11] <MrTopless> <robertmaxrees>, http://jsfiddle.net/Lnp231bk/1/
[10:39:14] <MrTopless> wrong link
[10:39:20] <MrTopless> this one is right
[10:39:32] <robertmaxrees> console error.
[10:40:26] <sweet2k4> I want to trigger an event when i scroll down on page
[10:40:42] <MrTopless> wait missing functions
[10:42:23] <robertmaxrees> that's a really complicated example.
[10:42:52] <MrTopless> http://jsfiddle.net/Lnp231bk/3/
[10:43:47] <robertmaxrees> you're detecting on mousedown.
[10:44:12] <MrTopless> on click its not working
[10:44:13] <MrTopless> try it out
[10:44:17] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[10:44:24] <MrTopless> did it work?
[10:44:32] <robertmaxrees> oh, on click.
[10:44:33] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:45:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lnp231bk/4/

[10:51:12] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, thanx :-)
[10:51:15] <robertmaxrees> sure
[10:51:40] <MrTopless> nice latest jquery everything works cool
[10:51:52] <MrTopless> is it worth migrating to 2.x?
[10:52:12] <robertmaxrees> 2.x and 1.x have the exact same features.
[10:52:18] <decx> if you don'T have to care about legacy browsers
[10:52:44] <robertmaxrees> the only difference is whether or not you care about IE6, IE7, or IE8.
[10:52:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/browser-support/ for more.
[10:52:54] <MrTopless> got it, I need to care about legacy browsers.
[10:53:02] <MrTopless> so I'll stay with 1.x
[11:02:43] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: You vanished.
[11:55:57] <DasLumberJackYa> hey guys, can ya check this problem out, it has to do with jquery delegated event handlers http://pastie.org/10098700 danamically added html with the class for the event seem to fire twice
[11:56:34] <DasLumberJackYa> slides down and then back up right away
[11:58:00] <NoiseEee> you don't run that again after the element has been added, right DasLumberJackYa?
[11:58:29] <DasLumberJackYa> no
[11:58:39] <DasLumberJackYa> i just have that one declaration
[11:59:01] <DasLumberJackYa> and then the html is dynamically added after load
[11:59:08] <NoiseEee> can you set up a fiddle?
[11:59:12] <cjohnson> paste more code with more context
[11:59:20] <cjohnson> sounds like that snippet you pasted is getting run more than once
[11:59:33] <DasLumberJackYa> ok Ill try to set it up better
[11:59:58] <Cork> DasLumberJackYa: also don't add random attributes without a data- prefix
[12:00:15] <Cork> you risk colliding with future attribute specs
[12:00:31] <Cork> the data- prefix was added to the standard to prevent that from happening
[12:01:20] <DasLumberJackYa> ok but it is unique... milleseonds
[12:01:34] <Cork> DasLumberJackYa: just change the name from index to data-index
[12:01:42] <DasLumberJackYa> ok
[12:05:12] <noober03> i have a dropdown with optgroups and i am trying to set the selected option, but i am having difficulities, can someone tell me what i am doing wrong?
[12:05:13] <noober03> var optgroup = $('select optgroup[label="'+label_value+'"]')       var option = optgroup.find('option[value="'+category_selected+'"]')       option.attr('selected', true);
[12:05:45] <Cork> noober03: set .val on the select element
[12:05:57] <Cork> noober03: also you can't change element states with attr
[12:06:14] <Cork> attr is get/setAttribute, for properties you want .prop
[12:06:37] <Cork> noober03: so $('select').val(category_selected);
[12:08:57] <DasLumberJackYa> cjohnson: Cork: sorry, there was a snippet that I fogot to get rid of cj was right, whwoops sorry
[12:09:30] <Uhkis> wow, Cork doing evening shift :-)
[12:09:57] <Cork> Uhkis: not really, i just commented on data-
[12:10:32] <bepolite> evening shift??
[12:10:34] <bepolite> LOL
[12:10:36] <Uhkis> Cork: just rare to see you here in the evening :)
[12:10:54] <DasLumberJackYa> Cork: you mentioned that any attribute that is going to be dynamic should have data prepended?
[12:10:58] <Cork> Uhkis: not exactly rare, but it is much less frequent then on he days
[12:11:01] <DasLumberJackYa> is that just standard practice?
[12:11:29] <Cork> DasLumberJackYa: no, what i said is attribute that aren't defined by the standard should always have data- infront of them
[12:11:41] <DasLumberJackYa> ok, i think I get it now
[12:11:47] <DasLumberJackYa> thanks
[12:11:51] <Cork> np
[12:12:02] <cjohnson> if HTML6 introduces the "index" attribute it would break your code if you didn't change to data-index
[12:12:07] <cjohnson> actually isn't there already an index attribute?
[12:12:16] <Cork> cjohnson: there won't be an html6
[12:12:27] <noober03> thanks Cork will look into
[12:12:27] <Uhkis> first time ever seeing "html6"
[12:12:28] <Cork> they removed the numbering from the html standard
[12:12:29] <coldhead> THAT'S NOT THE POINT CORK
[12:12:29] <cjohnson> semantics ;)
[12:12:36] <cjohnson> just making a point
[12:12:48] <Cork> html5 is just marketing babble
[12:12:49] <Uhkis> html5 hype already died? :D
[12:12:58] <cjohnson> you're marketing bable
[12:13:06] <Cork> heh
[12:13:20] <DasLumberJackYa> oh i get it now
[12:13:23] <DasLumberJackYa> makes sense
[12:13:50] <Cork> and ya html live is adding attributes to elements
[12:13:57] <DasLumberJackYa> does nobody use html features like canvas or what?
[12:14:10] <Cork> DasLumberJackYa: that is part of the html spec
[12:14:31] <Cork> they just dropped the numbering and instead have a "living" standard
[12:14:34] <cjohnson> Cork: on that note though, how will they do feature detection in html? meaning how will you differentiate whether your browser supports a given feature of html
[12:14:37] <cjohnson> what used to be done via doctype
[12:14:38] <Cork> that gets modified with new features
[12:14:39] <DasLumberJackYa> I see
[12:15:00] <DasLumberJackYa> browsers have to adopt the standard anyway.. right?
[12:15:07] <Cork> cjohnson: the same way they already do it
[12:15:11] <Cork> you check for the feature
[12:15:18] <Uhkis> cjohnson: well there's a bunch of libraries to check for those (and emulate)
[12:15:22] <cjohnson> that sounds like JS
[12:15:25] <cjohnson> I'm talking about strictly html
[12:15:36] <cjohnson> you used to be able to trigger different behaviors based on the doctype
[12:15:36] <Cork> DasLumberJackYa: the standard is made when the majority of the browsers support the feature
[12:15:41] <Cork> that is how we got eme
[12:15:47] <DasLumberJackYa> I see
[12:15:57] <Cork> chrome + ie == > 50%
[12:16:16] <Cork> so it became a standard nomater what the other browsers liked
[12:16:44] <Cork> cjohnson: no, you don't
[12:16:56] <Cork> cjohnson: html doctype has been reduced to <!doctype html>
[12:17:09] <cjohnson> right, so I'm asking how to trigger the alternate behaviors now
[12:17:12] <Cork> and that part is just kept to prevent triggering quirk mode
[12:17:13] <cjohnson> because it used to be via doctype
[12:17:25] <Cork> if you want html use <!doctype html>
[12:17:35] <Cork> if you want xhtml that is the content-type anyway
[12:17:41] <Cork> not doctype
[12:17:50] <Cork> there isn't really any other doctypes
[12:18:01] <Cork> except the old html3 and html4
[12:18:04] <Uhkis> and that kinda means any super old site with that doctype is now "html5" ;D
[12:18:04] <cjohnson> right
[12:18:24] <cjohnson> so what that means is that they can never introduce changes html that break things?
[12:18:29] <cjohnson> it has to just keep piling up and up and up?
[12:18:29] <Cork> Uhkis: yes, cause html is backwards compatible
[12:18:39] <Cork> cjohnson: exactly
[12:18:40] <cjohnson> because in the past we have been able to start fresh using the doctype to differentiate
[12:18:45] <cjohnson> they're giving up on that idea?
[12:18:53] <Cork> cjohnson: it was never a good idea
[12:18:54] <noober03> Cork: i tried $('select').val(category_selected); but it doesn't seem to work
[12:19:10] <Cork> noober03: you would have to create a jsfiddle then
[12:19:13] <cjohnson> I don't think piling up and up forever is a good idea...
[12:19:15] <noober03> i can have the same values in different optgroups
[12:19:15] <Cork> cause that sould work just fine
[12:19:16] <Uhkis> does geocities/tripod still exist? i bet there's some "html5" sites there
[12:19:31] <Cork> cjohnson: you're looking at it from the wrong angle
[12:19:37] <Cork> cjohnson: sure, they are deprecating tags
[12:19:43] <Cork> like <blink> for example
[12:19:54] <Cork> but they can't change things that break old sites
[12:20:04] <Cork> browsers hasn't been able to do that; ever
[12:20:09] <Cork> xhtml is the only exception
[12:20:19] <Cork> but again that isn't controller by the doctype
[12:20:32] <Cork> the standard explicitly FORBIDS it to
[12:21:00] <DasLumberJackYa> i would imagine the browser them selves would be responisble for how any tag is rendered
[12:21:16] <Uhkis> what? was <blink> actually html at some point?
[12:21:21] <Cork> Uhkis: sure
[12:21:25] <Cork> ?mdn blink
[12:21:26] <b-ot> Cork: <blink> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink
[12:21:28] <DasLumberJackYa> i remember blink
[12:21:47] <DasLumberJackYa> most annoying thing ever
[12:21:53] <Cork> Uhkis: i helped a few user reimplement it with animate when firefox removed the support :)
[12:21:56] <Uhkis> i recall some tags not being actual html but still worked
[12:22:07] <Uhkis> like marquee
[12:22:18] <Cork> marquee was actually in the standard for a while
[12:22:25] <Uhkis> haha
[12:22:30] <Uhkis> "why would anyone use this" :D
[12:22:49] <Cork> we also have <font> and <center>...
[12:23:03] <Uhkis> good old <center>
[12:23:12] <coldhead> so many memories
[12:23:28] <Cork> cjohnson: btw to answer your question about breaking with the past; have a look at the <image> tag
[12:23:39] <Cork> ?mdn image tag
[12:23:39] <Uhkis> then suddenly it was "noob, use <div align="center">"
[12:23:39] <b-ot> Cork: <img> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img
[12:23:43] <Cork> uh... no
[12:23:48] <cjohnson> :P
[12:24:18] <Cork> sigh.. the docs isn't fully up to date yet
[12:24:20] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement
[12:24:24] <Uhkis> silly b-ot, you missed 2 chars
[12:24:36] <noober03> Cork: here is my jsfiddle  https://jsfiddle.net/xhvcek45/
[12:28:10] <Cork> noober03: https://jsfiddle.net/xhvcek45/2/
[12:28:36] <Cork> (scary edge doesn't load so it made me really confused for a while)
[12:29:38] <noober03> Cork: what happens if the optgroup changes to bathroom but the value stays as ceiling?
[12:30:36] <Cork> noober03: browsers remember the selected option by the value, not selected option index
[12:30:39] <islalobo> Hello, I'm adding a class to html initially through db check and printing php array. Then I have some js that toggles the class based on if one of two radio buttons is checked. The radio button also triggers an ajax callback. When the ajax callback is enabled the js toggleClass doesn't work, when I comment it out the toggleClass works as expected
[12:31:09] <Cork> noober03: so you shouldn't use the same value for multiple places if you want the browser to behave correctly
[12:31:53] <noober03> i have ceiling under both Office and Bathroom, which poses a problem
[12:32:00] <DasLumberJackYa> islalobo: can you make a pastie or js fiddle
[12:32:22] <Cork> noober03: yes, and it will either way, cause the browser won't see them as different
[12:32:40] <Cork> noober03: the browser when it restores it will just pick the first in the list
[12:33:08] <islalobo> DasLumberJackYa: yep, one second :)
[12:33:34] <Cork> noober03: so i would recommend prefixing the value with a value representing the group
[12:33:53] <Cork> like value="Office-Seiling"
[12:37:13] <BeWilled_> decx, what an ellegant solution. That will surely open my mind a little more. Thanks again
[12:39:02] <noober03> ok thanks
[13:00:31] <lexbuck> I've got some data being returned via AJAX. I loop over that data and then append something to an #images div. Once that data is appended, I'm trying to select the first item that was appended and add a class to it but it doesn't seem to be doing anything: https://dpaste.de/NUkT any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[13:09:33] <BillCriswell> lexbuck: I think you want that if () after the .each() loop if I'm following things right.
[13:09:53] <BillCriswell> Wait I wasn't.
[13:10:30] <BillCriswell> Well, $('span') is going to get the first span in the document. Do you mean to get the first span fter you add them all?
[13:13:49] <lexbuck> BillCriswell: if the if is after the .each loop, then I won't be able to see if index === 0 right? I'm probably confused, I'm no jquery expert
[13:14:16] <BillCriswell> lexbuck: Yeah I caught that later. You want the first span in #images though, right?
[13:16:29] <BillCriswell> Chances are you want to do something like $('#images span').first().addClass('selected-image'); and you can just do that after the each.
[13:16:34] <lexbuck> BillCriswell: Yeah, correct. I'm appending a bunch of <span><img</span>'s to #images and once all are appended, I want to target the first <span> inside of #images so I can add a class to it
[13:17:10] <BillCriswell> lexbuck: Got ya. Then yeah, my previous line should help you out.
[13:18:02] <lexbuck> BillCriswell: Yeah, I tried doing different variations of that for probably an hour before deciding to jump inside the loop to try. That wouldn't work either. It's like things are happening too quick to be able to see that .first().addClass() code when it's outside of the loop. If if jump into console and manually run that code, it works great. But put it in there after the .each(), it does nothing
[13:18:54] <cjohnson> move the if inside the onload probably
[13:19:05] <cjohnson> you're appending nodes asynchronously and then trying to access them synchronously
[13:19:09] <cjohnson> doesn't work like that
[13:19:20] <BillCriswell> lexbuck: It might have something to do with waiting for the image to load. It might get to the end of the onload before the load onload fires off.
[13:19:33] <BillCriswell> yeah what cjohnson is saying basically.
[13:19:39] <mg123> Hi guys - can someone explain why on mobile safari the jQuery click event is not firing (its ignoring the e.preventDefault()) when you click on one of the movie thumbnails below the first youtube video on http://www.popsicle.com/campaigns/theater/
[13:20:33] <lexbuck> cjohnson: sorry i'm not sure I follow you. Here's my code currently (I moved the if out to try BillCriswell code again). where hsould I move the if, again?
[13:20:36] <lexbuck> https://dpaste.de/2fC4
[13:21:15] <cjohnson> you are appending the nodes in onload
[13:21:22] <cjohnson> which doesn't fire until this entire hunk of code completes
[13:21:26] <cjohnson> even if they load instantly
[13:21:40] <BillCriswell> ah ok then the image.onload is throwing you off.
[13:22:16] <cjohnson> I would just check if index == 0 and if it is, add that class inside the loop
[13:23:54] <BillCriswell> Something like $('#images').append('<span class="' + (index === 0) ? 'selected-image' : '' + '"><img src="/assets/images/ajax-loader.gif" realsrc="'+ item +'" width="54" height="54" /></span>'); would work.
[13:23:54] <cjohnson> https://dpaste.de/njKn
[13:24:20] <BillCriswell> or that!
[13:28:15] <decx> addClass supports ternary
[13:28:56] <lexbuck> thanks BillCriswell and cjohnson: cjohnson's code worked great. Just because I'm curious, I'm wondering why $('#images span).first().addClass() won't work if it's after and outside of the .each loop? Seems all code would have been appended at that point? Or am I still just not getting out the onload is working?
[13:29:41] <BillCriswell> lexbuck: the image.onload happens asyncronously, so it can happen way after that loop is finished
[13:29:56] <cjohnson> it will always happen after the loop is finished
[13:30:06] <rubyonrailed> When i console.log my className and it returns this: "add-school btn btn-info"  How do I just grab "add-school"?
[13:30:16] <mg123> Hi guys - can someone explain why on mobile safari the jQuery click event is not firing (its ignoring the e.preventDefault()) when you click on one of the movie thumbnails below the first youtube video on http://www.popsicle.com/campaigns/theater/
[13:30:26] <cjohnson> it will execute until the end of the current synchronous block (usually just the current event handler) and then any async code will fire after that
[13:30:55] <BillCriswell> rubyonrailed: What do you mean grab it?
[13:31:10] <rubyonrailed> BillCriswell save "add-school" into a variable
[13:32:09] <cjohnson> lexbuck: setTimeout is another async method, like event handlers. here's a quick example: http://jsfiddle.net/q6u1bd70/
[13:32:16] <lexbuck> BillCriswell cjohnson ok thanks. that's hard for me to wrap my head around right now. Seems that since th onload is inside the loop, it would just happen, well, inside the loop not after it's finished. But that's just my elementary way of thinking I guess. I'm noticing that cjohnson's code works, but not consistent for some reason. I'm returning images that I've scraped from a URL and it seems to randomly select a span to add the class
[13:32:16] <cjohnson> this will never fire in the order you intended it to fire
[13:32:16] <lexbuck>  to. IT might be first, or second or maybe not at all.
[13:32:19] <BillCriswell> rubyonrailed: You can do something like if ($el.is('.add-school')) { }
[13:37:54] <decx> BillCriswell: from earlier, look at this mess :( http://jsfiddle.net/decx/jnwcgLja/
[13:38:50] <BillCriswell> decx: haha nice
[13:39:21] <decx> so many variables, somebody should write a framework for that stuff :>
[13:40:45] <BillCriswell> decx: What's going on here? Are you trying to just run it once and give the option for it to run again?
[13:41:19] <decx> yeah, continuing it is a whole new problem ;)
[13:42:46] <decx> i don't think i could invoke a fake hover and use the animation-play-state css thing
[13:42:57] <decx> or maybe that could wokr
[13:43:47] <BillCriswell> Couldn't you add a class when you start and remove the class on end and just toggle it basically?
[13:44:16] <decx> hey that might even work
[13:44:41] <BillCriswell> also this looks promising: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804444/how-to-pause-and-resume-css3-animation-using-javascript
[13:45:13] <decx> wow http://jsfiddle.net/decx/jnwcgLja/1/
[13:45:16] <BillCriswell> shit, that second answer is awesome
[13:45:40] <BillCriswell> decx: lol awesome

[13:46:34] <decx> amazing
[13:47:11] <BillCriswell> these computers nowadays
[13:48:09] <BillCriswell> how long did you spend on that?
[13:48:30] <decx> couple of minutes here and there
[13:48:54] <BillCriswell> fun
[13:49:08] <BillCriswell> that's something that would take me way too long and i'd find that answer and get pissed
[13:49:33] <decx> i love it, i hated how it looked and you saved the day ^^
[13:50:20] <decx> now to find some use for it
[13:50:43] <BillCriswell> i'm sure you will, you always do
[13:50:45] <decx> getting the current values for internal stuff is still helpful i guess ;)
[13:50:54] <BillCriswell> absolutely
[13:50:58] <decx> so it's not a complete loss haha
[13:53:28] <BillCriswell> yeah, nothing ever is really

[17:08:54] <islalobo> Hello, we're using drupal and I have setup an ajax callback on a form item. The form item is a radio button with two options on/off. also attached to the radio button is some js to toggle a class. The class will toggle correctly as long as the callback is commented out Here is a past of my code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c4afb3abfc6f40a6762e
[17:22:59] <islalobo1> This is marked a bit more clearly: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f329ad5bb73438939ef6
[17:32:17] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> is E supposed to be a PHP or JS file?
[17:32:57] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  that is the ajax callback
[17:33:12] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[17:33:16] <robertmaxrees> is that JS or PHP?
[17:35:09] <islalobo> php
[17:35:35] <robertmaxrees> so it sounds like your question is about the PHP - I'd ask in ##php.  you'll probably get a faster response.
[17:36:10] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: yeah, I suppose I only have a bit of js in there :P  Thanks!
[17:54:14] <Insentience> is jquery conflict a thing? i'm injecting jqeury into a page that already uses jquery
[18:08:54] <wtfphotoshop> you know what iv noticed
[18:29:49] <datanity> How could I have a var quickEditStatus; with shared scope...   so that way aDesignLayout.position.quick_edit.hide could set quickEditStatus = "hidden" and aDesignLayout.position.quick_edit.show could set quickEditStatus = "visible".   Currently, aDesignLayout.position.quick_edit = {};
[18:34:47] <datanity> for example: http://pastie.org/10099158  the hide tooltip function is called on every click.  But, I only wanted to call it if first the "show" tooltip function has been clicked.
[19:05:26] <Cork> datanity: wrap those two functions in a scope and define the variable in there
[19:05:32] <Cork> (function() {})()
[19:28:35] <MetalHead77> I need an easy to integrate image gallery for my jquerymobile app, any suggestions?
[19:45:29] <alturic> hey guys, I have this code: http://jsbin.com/tukililaqu/1/ and while the the functionality works great for alerting, I'm confused to hell on how I can use   someObj.fruitsGranted   in HTMl elsewhere on the page. The actual text that is being outputed by alert() is exactly what I need as plain text, but I'm hung up. :-/
[20:00:23] <datanity> Because $("#range_" + i, Html) is used twice below, should it be cached?
[20:01:06] <datanity> if  ( $("#range_" + i, Html).length )   {   $("#range_" + i, Html).val(config[i]);  }
[20:01:17] <datanity> Because, the first time it's used is inside an if   if (   $("#range_" + i, Html)   )
[20:01:18] <datanity> So, if I cached it before the if with var $rangeHTML = $("#range_" + i, Html);...  it's possible the element wouldn't exist during the var assignment.  But, does that even matter?
[20:01:23] <Mark_2> is anyone familar with the ajax infinite scrolling?
[20:02:37] <datanity> it's like... if you're using something only two times... once... if ( using it here ) { and again using it here }
[20:02:46] <datanity> should you cache it before the if statement
[20:03:03] <datanity> knowing that it's possible it might not exist
[20:03:15] <datanity> or, do you search dom twice for same look up selector.
[20:23:22] <rifky> hey guys
[20:43:11] <alturic> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/BWcJZj2E and the resulting html it puts out is "Location1,Location2,Location3", is there anyway to add a space after each comma?
[21:33:53] <datanity> with var newArray = "Location1,Location2,Location3".split(",")
[21:34:07] <datanity> then output array with space
[21:35:29] <alturic> Hmm, interesting. I did: $('#locations').html(val.join(", ")); and it accomplished what I wanted.
[21:35:55] <alturic> Granted, I wasn't making the array technically, val[i] = this.id was making the array.
[21:40:05] <Peter_Occ> Can someone please tell me why the first on('click' doesn't work? The second one, using "document" as the selector does work.

[22:24:03] <tkf> is it possible to query using jquery an existing sqlite3 database created with the sqlite console in linux
[22:46:41] <bepolite> tkf: with nodeJS?
[22:46:56] <bepolite> tkf: jquery can't do that normally
