[03:18:46] <numb21> I have 4 button with class A,B,C and D. How do i call a function if either class A or B is clicked;
[03:18:47] <numb21> ?
[07:26:04] <ai88> In an event handler, does is make sense to assign $(this) to a variable performancewise? thanks
[09:12:45] <placidb> hi. I'm having some trouble formulating a selector query. how would I go about selecting elements of a certain class, except those that belong to a specific parent class? thank you for your time.
[09:13:06] <henk_> do you have a fiddle maybe?
[09:46:20] <placidb> henk_, I don't have anything. I'm just wondering how to go about selecting all elements of a certain class, except those that are children of a certain parent class
[09:46:53] <placidb> I tried something like ':not(.parent-class) .child-class' but that doesn't work
[09:47:30] <henk_> so does each child class you don't want have the same parent?
[09:47:41] <henk_> you could do (.child).parent()
[09:47:58] <placidb> no there are .child-class elements all over the DOM, and some belong to .parent-class
[09:48:07] <placidb> I don't want to select any that belong to .parent-class
[09:48:28] <henk_> if != parent-class ?
[09:49:04] <placidb> yes, I'm currently checking whether the .child-class elements belong to the parent I don't want in a loop
[09:49:17] <henk_> or if != parent-class && child class then $(.child-class).function(){}
[09:49:17] <placidb> but that seems suboptimal to me
[09:50:44] <placidb> I'm only accepting it as a workaround because I was already processing all .child-classes in a loop, and a .parent() or .closest() check seemed like a quick win
[09:51:01] <henk_> did you try .siblings?
[09:51:08] <placidb> what would that give me?
[09:51:40] <sillyslux> try $(':not(.parent-class) > span')
[09:52:44] <placidb> sillyslux, I had already tried that (scroll up), unless you mean to indicate some solution by the direct child selector?
[09:53:02] <ZoderUck> hello
[09:53:15] <sillyslux> have you tried with `>`
[09:53:59] <placidb> sillyslux, why do you think that would make a difference?
[09:54:18] <sillyslux> because i've tried
[09:55:18] <placidb> doesn't work here
[09:55:22] <ZoderUck> hello could anybody check a url for me?
[09:55:26] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/sillyslux/wknjk2gr/
[09:55:59] <placidb> also, my .child-classes are strewn about the entire DOM, at various levels deep and belonging to all sorts of different sub-parents
[10:01:27] <sillyslux> well it did not work for deep nesting
[10:03:45] <placidb> sillyslux: my layout looks more like http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vyGjro
[10:04:30] <placidb> neither selector gives me the desired result
[10:13:57] <CocoStorm> Hi, I've added Flexslider (image slider) to my Shopify page but it only works when I add no conflict mode.  However, the rest of the jquery stuff on the page doesn't work - I get an undefined error $.  Why is this happening?
[10:14:24] <CocoStorm> This only happens when I add the $.noConflict()
[10:24:24] <sillyslux> sry had a talk...
[10:25:16] <sillyslux> yeah i couldn't reach those deeply nested too
[10:33:36] <sillyslux> placidb, how about http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ENKLqO
[10:45:17] <placidb> sillyslux: that is basically what I'm already doing inside the loop
[10:45:46] <placidb> I don't really need to refactor it, and I prefer the legibility of my current solution
[10:46:01] <placidb> thank you for your time however
[10:53:22] <sillyslux> looking through jquery:selectors, i don't think there's something useful, but i'm also not really a jquery pro
[11:05:37] <wux> hi.
[11:09:20] <wux> I have a page that open a link in a new tab and this new tab contains a form that I'd like to autofill ... I'm good until opening the new tab, but I'm stuck to fill in the form ...any idea? thanks!
[11:38:11] <krok> hello all i want to attach an onclick event handler using jquery
[11:38:16] <krok> i want my image to open in a new tab
[11:38:18] <krok> $("img.galleryID").click( openImage );
[11:38:33] <krok> openImage function does the work, but it opens blank tab, how can i pass the element as an argument ?
[11:38:58] <krok> if i do it with html, it works like this: onclick="openImage(this)";
[11:39:14] <krok> but since i have many img elements and i want to avoid redundancy i want to use jquery, but looks like i can not do it correctly

[13:39:29] <sillyslux> krok https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/#summary
[13:44:51] <krok> sillyslux in section "Event Propagation" what is the event paramter ?
[13:44:53] <krok> parameter ?
[13:44:56] <krok> what does it hold
[13:45:06] <krok> ?
[13:46:39] <sillyslux> what? where? what?
[13:46:47] <sillyslux> you mean in $( "#list" ).on( "click", "a", function( event ) {
[13:46:56] <sillyslux> the example there?
[13:46:57] <krok> yes
[13:47:17] <sillyslux> #list is your gallery
[13:47:34] <sillyslux> .on click "a" -> a is your image
[13:47:54] <sillyslux> so there will be only one onclick listener
[13:47:59] <sillyslux> the one on your gallery
[13:48:40] <sillyslux> and the function will only be executed if (in the example) an "a" tag element is clicked
[13:49:39] <sillyslux> you said "opens blank tab", is that a new tab in your browser?
[13:50:05] <krok> sillyslux can you tell me what do i have to fix?
[13:50:06] <krok> http://paste.ofcode.org/DKcp5VWMtPiKtK6BrukVEP
[13:50:22] <krok> sillyslux oh wait sorry
[13:50:30] <krok> this is wrong i did not edit it fully
[13:51:23] <sillyslux> what do you want to happen after clicking?
[13:51:56] <krok> http://paste.ofcode.org/sdLPveTHPZg6iGtxDt2WTP
[13:52:16] <krok> sillyslux i just want if a user clicks on a thumbnail image, then to open a new tab with the image in original size
[13:53:06] <sillyslux> did you define openImage?
[13:53:10] <krok> yes
[13:53:33] <krok> everything works if i have attribute on the HTML element onclick="openImage(this)"
[13:53:43] <sillyslux> that function takes what? a url? and opens it in new tab?
[13:53:47] <krok> but i do not want to have it for every element because it is redundant
[13:54:06] <krok> sillyslux i am new to JS i do not know what exactly it takes because JS is dynamically typed
[13:54:49] <sillyslux> well, have you tried openImage(this)?
[13:54:51] <krok> i just saw that if i do onclick="openImage(this)"; and in openImage function i have window.open(id.src)
[13:54:57] <krok> where id is the formal parameter
[13:55:24] <krok> well here is the code on line 6 i have written it like openImage(this)
[13:55:25] <krok> http://paste.ofcode.org/sdLPveTHPZg6iGtxDt2WTP
[13:56:15] <sillyslux> what happens if you replace line3-7 with openImage(this)?
[13:57:15] <sillyslux> is it to much to ask for a fiddle?
[13:57:52] <sillyslux> maybe you could also try openImage(event.currentTarget)
[13:57:59] <krok> worked, thank you
[13:58:03] <sillyslux> ah good
[13:58:05] <sillyslux> :)
[13:58:44] <krok> have you noticed any problems with using .on() ? i am asking because on the page you have given me, it says that it is "beta"
[13:59:56] <sillyslux> say what?!
[14:00:33] <krok> look on the right
[14:00:33] <krok> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/#summary
[14:00:38] <krok> it says in yellow label "beta"
[14:00:44] <sillyslux> that beta means the learn.jquery platform
[14:01:01] <sillyslux> not the event-delegation functionality
[14:01:18] <sillyslux> click it and see for yourself
[14:02:08] <krok> thanks
[14:02:35] <sillyslux> in jquery.js there's not betas anywhere
[14:02:40] <sillyslux> :)
[14:05:37] <krok> perfect
[14:24:43] <krok> sillyslux do you know how can i make my site play background music when someone has connected?
[14:24:54] <krok> without the music stopping when they change to another page in the same site ?
[14:26:57] <krok> please quote my name so that i can see that you have answered
[14:28:12] <sillyslux> krok mh i don't know that
[14:28:29] <krok> i saw that i can use <audio> but it stops when i change the page
[14:28:44] <sillyslux> then change the contents with ajax
[14:30:41] <sillyslux> krok try something like $('body').load('url.html body')
[14:31:19] <krok> sillyslux i think ajax is used when I communicate with server, but i am not using server, i am just creating a website to be viewed locally
[14:31:20] <sillyslux> might make additional steps necessary for browser title, css files and more
[14:31:46] <sillyslux> "change page" means what then?
[14:31:58] <sillyslux> navigating away to some other domain?
[14:32:12] <krok> no
[14:32:16] <krok> to other .html
[14:32:17] <krok> document
[14:32:31] <krok> i am just making very simple website using HTML CSS JS to show what i have learnt
[14:32:34] <sillyslux> yeah you can load that other.html with ajax
[14:33:03] <sillyslux> communicate with server happens pretty much always
[14:33:38] <krok> i am having trouble even aligning a paragraph right now :D
[14:33:54] <sillyslux> if you open your websites on file:// then you could say your communicating with a server component in the browser
[14:34:17] <krok> ok
[14:34:34] <sillyslux> so try $.load
[14:34:45] <sillyslux> $().load
[14:34:56] <krok> will come back to this later, i will have to fix my paragraph now
[14:35:05] <sillyslux> ok :)
[14:35:14] <sillyslux> but i'm off now bye
[14:37:37] <krok> sillyslux i am trying to align this
[14:37:37] <krok> http://paste.ofcode.org/38RJsCb4j8xDeF9vW9d7tM5
[14:37:42] <krok> with this CSS
[14:37:43] <krok> http://paste.ofcode.org/q3ik5eS7xevCL2EiJCXrMb
[14:37:49] <krok> but things do not happen..
[14:39:07] <krok> only the "In property" sentence is aligned to the right of the page
[14:39:20] <krok> the lists and the other sentence remain on the left
[14:48:20] <kabbb> hello all, i am using jfeed trying to parse for videos in an mrss feed but i cannot do it

[18:15:27] <altab> hi, I have a problem : Google Maps JS API markers blurred on Android web browser - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40559143/google-maps-js-api-markers-blurred-on-android-web-browser

[22:11:08] <sigdk> Hello. I'm facing this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27238938/bootstrap-popover-destroy-recreate-works-only-every-second-time  and the proposed solution (hack) seems to work.  Can't I somehow use .then() instead of setTimeout ?
[22:11:17] <sigdk> $('#popoverspan').popover('destroy').then(function() { ... }); did not help
[22:41:54] <Utils> is .fail equivalent to setting an error callback in $.ajax?
