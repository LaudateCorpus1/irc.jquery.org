[00:09:46] <Al_nz1> If I have a input with name=person[0].surname - where the number in the [] is a index is there a way to select on the end bit - ie surname? like find('*surname') if wild card * was supported
[03:13:10] <dimi1947> I am using jquery validate and I want you to take a look at this code found IN the plugin(https://hastebin.com/fifakevovo.js see the commenting) which produces an error when I start to fill an input-I do not want to get into more details now...
[03:13:40] <dimi1947> what can you make out of it???
[03:16:02] <Cork> dimi1947: impossible to say without knowing what validators validator.settings.rules contains
[03:17:07] <dimi1947> Cork: well I am not suprised by your answer..let me prepare a more detailed explanation of the problem
[03:17:34] <Cork> also the error message you get is needed
[03:19:21] <dimi1947> Cork:what tool do you want me to use to better show off the issue...name it(pastebin,hastebin,fiddle)?
[03:21:58] <Cork> jsfiddle.net is normally better
[03:22:12] <dimi1947> ok give me some time...
[03:43:51] <Neo_3333> ðŸ˜€ hi
[03:44:14] <Neo_3333> ðŸ˜œ
[03:45:51] <Neo_3333> need create directory like this /documents/passports/2017/07 and there resize all scans of passports
[03:46:22] <Neo_3333> resort
[03:46:35] <Neo_3333> resize means not place , I confused )))
[03:47:19] <Neo_3333> there place scans of passports
[03:48:31] <Neo_3333> is there php channel ?
[03:49:09] <Neo_3333> ok, need got date and year , and than form path
[03:52:13] <Cork> Neo_3333: => ##php
[03:52:25] <Cork> javascript can't create directories on the server
[03:52:52] <Neo_3333> I can't join there
[03:53:03] <Cork> you need a registered nick
[03:53:10] <Cork> /ns help register
[03:53:33] <Neo_3333> yes, I will better use google
[03:53:35] <Cork> (and if you have problem with that => #freenode)
[03:53:55] <Neo_3333> I know php perfectly
[04:01:53] <z3t0> hi all
[04:02:18] <z3t0> is there an easy way to reorder elements. Say I want to move elementA to be after elementB
[04:02:27] <z3t0> I saw the after method but does  that clone or just move?
[04:02:59] <dimi1947> cork:https://jsfiddle.net/user/dashboard/
[04:03:08] <dimi1947> sorry wrong link
[04:03:42] <Cork> z3t0: $('#elementB').after($('#elementA'))
[04:04:04] <Cork> z3t0: elements doesn't clone unless you actively clone them
[04:04:12] <dimi1947> cork:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/n8umhqqd/  let us go step by step(tell me when you are ready as I see you are now talking to someone else)
[04:04:25] <Cork> z3t0: the dom is a child parent relation tree, and a child can only have one parent
[04:48:33] <z3t0> Cork: thanks that worked
[04:56:22] <dimi1947> cork:whenever you are ready tell me...
[05:04:46] <jackp10> hi everyone
[05:06:02] <jackp10> I have html content and I am looping through li elements to change the order of it. When I loop through the elements, I then use this:   html.push($(data).filter('li[data-filename="' + value + '"]')).html();
[05:06:15] <jackp10> but I notice the the actual LI is not included
[05:06:27] <jackp10> but only its content
[05:06:55] <jackp10> how can I include the LI too when I push it to the "html" variable array?
[05:09:06] <Cork> jackp10: if you just want to reorder the elements i would recommend using $('lis you want to sort').sort(function() {}).appendTo('parent')
[05:09:18] <Cork> no need to convert it to html and then reparse it again
[05:09:38] <cannap> https://paste.laravel.io/54pO4 something?
[05:09:56] <jackp10> thank you Cork... let me dig into it
[07:03:26] <Neo_3333> humidity is rising , barometer's getting low

[10:37:16] <Caspan_> Question i am making a sticky menu that when you scroll past it it stick to the top
[10:37:25] <Caspan_> i have it for the most part done other then one thing
[10:37:42] <Caspan_> I change the menu to fixed to stick to the top and the place where it was collapses
[10:37:45] <Cork> Caspan_: you might want to have a look at position: sticky;
[10:38:00] <Cork> most modern browsers supports it
[10:38:09] <Caspan_> so i want to set the height of the conatainer that used to hold it to the same height of the menu
[10:38:33] <MikeD_> "most modern browsers supports it" is a euphemism for "if it's not one of the browsers that supports it, too bad for them"  :)
[10:38:49] <Caspan_> so i can use .height to ge tthe height of the menu and i can set the old container to its height
[10:38:52] <Cork> there are polly fills you can use for those browsers
[10:39:08] <Caspan_> but how do i remove a propter og height
[10:39:14] <Caspan_> proptery of height
[10:39:14] <MikeD_> yeah, position: sticky is a nice feature
[10:39:28] <Caspan_> so that it goes back to being undefined
[10:39:39] <Caspan_> ill look at the stickey thing
[10:46:11] <Caspan_> well that wont work as the parent has to say in the view port
[10:46:22] <Caspan_> this menu will scroll down with the entire page
[10:46:43] <Caspan_> so position : sticky wont work
[10:47:06] <MikeD_> position: sticky goes on the headings INSIDE the menu.  the menu itself would be position: fixed
[10:47:22] <Caspan_> so back to what i was asking how do i set the height property on a selected element to undefined?
[10:48:16] <MikeD_> height: auto;  ??
[10:48:26] <Caspan_> because when i scroll down and the header becomes sticky it collapses its parent that it was in, I can set its height to fix that but when i scroll back up and i put the headerback in its parent i want to remove the static height i gave it
[10:48:38] <Caspan_> humm
[10:48:40] <Caspan_> trying
[10:48:54] <Caspan_> .height(auto)
[10:48:55] <Caspan_> ??
[10:49:47] <MikeD_> i thought you were using css
[10:50:01] <MikeD_> .css('height','auto') maybe
[10:50:30] <Caspan_> well on the on ready function i get the height of the headres, parent
[10:50:42] <MikeD_> i treat .css() as a useful but ugly hack
[10:50:58] <Caspan_> then if i scroll past that point i set the parets static height then fix the header and remove it form the parent DIV
[10:51:05] <Caspan_> okay ill try that
[10:51:52] <Caspan_> okay now i have to deal with responsive now
[10:52:02] <Caspan_> i can actually lave the height proptery on it
[10:52:17] <Caspan_> because once the header goes back in its the proper height
[10:52:37] <Caspan_> thanks MikeD_
[10:52:39] <MikeD_> do you have a live url to look at?  i can't visualize what you're saying
[10:53:02] <Caspan_> No sorry
[10:53:06] <Caspan_> its behind a pay wall
[10:53:12] <MikeD_> ok
[10:53:17] <Caspan_> i could try to recreate but i think i got what i need
[10:53:51] <Caspan_> by setting the .height(95) on it works great
[10:54:12] <Caspan_> that seets a style="height: 95px" on the object
[10:54:54] <Caspan_> and i jsut found out you can use .height(auto)
[10:55:08] <Caspan_> didnt know you could use auto
[10:57:17] <MikeD_> auto and none are defaults for a lot of properties and rarely are you setting them back rather than not setting them in the first place
[11:11:12] <Caspan_> thanks MikeD_ got it all to work and it looks smooth as hell
[11:11:32] <MikeD_> :)
[11:12:26] <Caspan_> now question
[11:12:30] <Caspan_> should be a simple one
[11:12:38] <Caspan_> i have this on a scroll even to check this
[11:12:53] <Caspan_> when i refresh a page the menu is not there till i scroll once
[11:13:02] <Caspan_> then it pops into place
[11:13:41] <Caspan_> I guess i would have to test its initial position if its above the top of the window
[11:14:01] <Caspan_> that  should fix if someone refreshes the page when scrolled down in the page
[11:14:49] <Caspan_> ill have to create a function with all my code in it and call it on page load and on scroll
[11:15:05] <Caspan_> think i just figured it out
[11:58:17] <d0x0b> hello, i am trying to get contents of iframe document, but I am receiving it empty, even though in browser i can see there is document content in iframe
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> d0x0b is the iframe on another domain?
[12:00:37] <d0x0b> robertmaxrees yes
[12:00:54] <robertmaxrees> that's why.  cross-origin.
[12:01:13] <d0x0b> Ah, hm even though it loads it in browser ?
[12:01:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:01:54] <robertmaxrees> rovb
[12:02:00] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window
[12:02:08] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:14:40] <robertmaxrees> there we
[13:24:05] <JrWebDev> how would i $('table').on('click', 'tr' function() {when i click tr background color changes.  when i click new tr. background color changes as well but the other tr goes back to nornmal}
[13:34:58] <taplar> what are you doing in the body of the method?
[13:35:13] <taplar> is it using 'this' or is it trying to lookup rows
[13:35:36] <taplar> because 'this' will be the row clicked
[13:37:02] <JrWebDev> thats right taplar
[13:37:03] <JrWebDev> this
[14:22:50] <Neo_3333> hi , how convert bytes to mega bytes ???
[14:22:59] <Neo_3333> need divide in 100 000 ?
[14:23:39] <Neo_3333> I got size of file in bytes, I need allow load till 1 Mbytes file, how it will in bytes ?
[14:23:48] <Neo_3333> 1Mb it's 100 000 bytes ?
[14:25:16] <Neo_3333> used converter http://prntscr.com/fs1k3r
[14:25:30] <Neo_3333> 1Mb equal 1 000 000 bytes , so many
[14:25:41] <Neo_3333> one million
[14:28:22] <Neo_3333> user must enter data in Mb points
[14:28:48] <Neo_3333> I need it convert automatically to bytes , How to do it ?
[14:29:16] <pavonia> 1 MB is often considered 1024*1024 bytes
[14:29:30] <Neo_3333> 1Mb - 1048576 bytes , How will 0.5 Mb ?? ?
[14:29:57] <Neo_3333> x=0.5*1048576 and divide on 1 ?
[14:30:10] <Neo_3333> yes yes yes , I guessed
[14:30:37] <Neo_3333> need do operator * , forgot how it call in English
[14:30:43] <Neo_3333> multiple maybe
[14:31:12] <Neo_3333> convert Mb to bytes need do multiple on 1048576
[14:31:52] <taplar> what does this have to do with jquery?
[14:32:40] <Neo_3333> no, I load file using input[type=file] and need confine maximal size
[14:33:38] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* now people are @ing me on twitter with support requests
[14:33:44] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3717793/javascript-file-upload-size-validation#3717847
[14:33:49] <taplar> robertmaxrees: huh?
[14:34:09] <robertmaxrees> a dude on Twitter mentioned me in a tweet asking for help.
[14:34:14] <taplar> lol
[14:34:18] <snover> robertmaxrees: all the perks!
[14:34:41] <taplar> just tell him you charge $500 an hour
[14:34:44] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:34:59] <taplar> lunch time included
[14:35:21] <Neo_3333> taplar, can user use program and bypassed checkout ?
[14:35:39] <Neo_3333> taplar, better check in php hanlder IMAO
[14:35:59] <taplar> i agree with the php thing
[14:36:02] <Neo_3333> taplar or need to do it twice , in javascript and php
[14:36:11] <taplar> i was simply linking to a possible solution, as the question is not in the context of this room
[14:36:32] <taplar> you should always have backend validation
[14:36:55] <Neo_3333> taplar, I usually ask about all in #wordpress room, just got ban there :)
[14:37:07] <taplar> so try ##javascript
[14:37:22] <Neo_3333> taplar, do you know how bypass ban ? I have dynamic IP and can't go there
[14:37:24] <pavonia> Banned for asking offtopic questions? :p
[14:38:05] <Neo_3333> taplar and tried using extension for browser which changed IP and it's can't help :(
[14:38:53] <Neo_3333> pavonia, maybe, yes , I thinking about how better include jQuery to wordpress in common chat and moderator banned me . It was not first time :)
[14:39:47] <Neo_3333> pavonia, there know me, but before extension for browser work perfect and I can bypass ban, now can't , don't know why . Extension calls Frigat
[14:39:48] <taplar> you should ask in ##javascript or ##php.  the question is not relevant at this point to jQuery
[14:40:28] <Neo_3333> taplar , ok , better say me how bypass bans
[14:40:46] <taplar> you are banned from both places?  regardless, that doesn't change the topic of this room
[14:40:48] <Neo_3333> taplar, need however mask my real data
[14:41:19] <pavonia> Ban evasion is usually a cause for even more trouble
[14:41:45] <Neo_3333> taplar, form one, only in #wordpress room, I used to asking there , and there me know
[14:42:23] <taplar> so i've suggested trying two other rooms that are more appropriate for your question
[14:43:20] <Neo_3333> pavonia, need research this trouble , there can easy bypass it maybe if change IP , or I dont' know maybe for IrC chats not suited it , need maybe to try direct enter there , using freenode.net site , without filezila
[14:43:34] <Neo_3333> taplar, ok
[14:43:37] <catbadger> I've had so much caffiene i can fly.
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> hey so can we not talk about ban evasion techniques?
[14:44:29] <pavonia> Neo_3333: Ask the person who banned you for the reason
[14:44:50] <Neo_3333> pavonia, speaking offtop :)
[14:45:09] <Neo_3333> pavonia, I frequently speak offtop there
[14:45:21] <robertmaxrees> lol this channel just got so meta.
[14:46:01] <Neo_3333> he warned me a few times .... , it's not first ban :)
[14:46:13] <robertmaxrees> so moving on then.
[14:46:17] <catbadger> lol
[14:46:30] <taplar> ya, if you guys want to keep talking about OT stuff, please take it to PM
[14:46:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[14:46:46] <catbadger> ok, so jquery inside cordova cross-pltform apps? Yay or Nay and why?
[14:47:25] <robertmaxrees> catbadger all about what your goals are imo.  if you think you'll need it, include it.
[14:47:57] <catbadger> I don't ever need it. I am just trying to shorten my dev time ;)
[14:48:14] <robertmaxrees> "need" was generic there - you know what I meant ;)
[14:48:21] <catbadger> hehe of course.
[14:48:27] <robertmaxrees> if you think you can get good use out of it, include it.
[14:48:42] <catbadger> I was just curious if anyone had used it in cordova :)_
[14:48:49] <robertmaxrees> lots of people have.
[14:49:01] <catbadger> but it is possible and relatively headache free?\
[14:49:05] <robertmaxrees> tons of guides even using jquery mobile with it.
[14:49:23] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) I've never done it myself but it looks to be possible,.
[14:49:32] <catbadger> cool thanks!
[14:49:35] <catbadger> :)
[14:58:52] <Croves> Hi folks! I'm using this plugin https://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/. How do I apply a mask after its value has been changed by ajax? This is my code: http://jsbin.com/cocarejamu/edit?js
[14:59:19] <Croves> When I submit the form for the first time, the mask works fine. But when I change some values and re-submit the form, the mask don't work anymore
[14:59:20] <catbadger> I don't think that's how masks work
[14:59:35] <catbadger> I cuold be mistaken though
[15:00:37] <catbadger> Croves your example is incomplete.
[15:01:00] <Croves> catbadger What's missing?
[15:01:04] <catbadger> html
[15:28:55] <Al_nz1> Can someone please take a look at this SO question : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44915203/thymeleaf-ajax-mapping-json-data its to do with getting JSON data from a backend mapped into the right fields in the front end
[15:29:06] <Al_nz1> feel free to upvote the question :)
[15:37:45] <ezio> in typescript, how can i pass "this" into $(`<iframe src="do ...`).ready(() => { //here
[16:25:26] <taplar> ezio: if you want the 'this' to be the iframe, don't use an arrow function
[17:20:41] <Al_nz1> if there are multiple copies of this code on a page how would I select the closest surname input ?
[17:21:52] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/Lh9t45a6/
[17:21:56] <robertmaxrees> generally by going to a shared parent container and then using .find()
[17:22:31] <robertmaxrees> would these be multiple panel-body elements or .row ?
[17:22:35] <Al_nz1> $(this).closest('form').find(whatever) ?
[17:22:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing a form on that fiddle, but sure.
[17:23:05] <Al_nz1> panel-body is the parent root for a particular group of fields
[17:23:08] <Al_nz1> ok lemme try
[17:29:04] <Al_nz1> like this : $(this).closest('panel-body').find('#surname'); for <input type="text" class="form-control" id="surname0" placeholder="surname" name="persons[0].surname" value="EASTWOOD">
[17:29:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:29:25] <taplar> you can't duplicate ids
[17:29:27] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[17:29:33] <robertmaxrees> and the IDs don't even match.
[17:29:44] <robertmaxrees> also: you're missing the period in the closest selector.
[17:29:51] <robertmaxrees> use a class for surname instead.
[17:32:27] <Al_nz1> what do you mean the id's dont match?
[17:32:51] <Al_nz1> leaving the 0 off the selector?
[17:33:11] <taplar> yep
[17:33:28] <robertmaxrees> but you shouldn't be using an ID here inm the first place.
[17:33:38] <Al_nz1> so is there a syntax for matching surname*
[17:33:57] <taplar> "use a class for surname instead. "
[17:34:08] <Al_nz1> ok, testing....
[17:36:06] <Al_nz1> <input type="text" class="form-control surname" id="surname0" placeholder="surname" name="persons[0].surname" value="EASTWOOD"> for $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.surname');
[17:36:10] <Al_nz1> didnt work
[17:36:30] <taplar> what is 'this'?
[17:36:32] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this) in that context?
[17:36:33] <robertmaxrees> hgahahaha
[17:36:55] <Al_nz1> its being run from a button
[17:37:00] <robertmaxrees> show us the code
[17:37:19] <taplar> is the button inside the related panel-body?
[17:38:13] <robertmaxrees> also: "didn't work" - why not?  specifics, yo.  make a fiddle that shows that's up.
[17:38:47] <Al_nz1> https://pastebin.com/FxRxwRFn
[17:38:50] <robertmaxrees> fiddle
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:39:08] <robertmaxrees> id="btnGetPerson"
[17:39:14] <robertmaxrees> can't repeat IDs duder
[17:39:24] <robertmaxrees>  $( '#btnGetPerson').click(function() { will only bind to the first thing with that ID.
[17:39:45] <taplar> lol
[17:39:55] <Al_nz1> where is it repeated?
[17:39:59] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:40:13] <taplar> you don't have multiple rows?
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> i would assume you have that button once for each .panel-body.
[17:40:34] <robertmaxrees> if not, make a fiddle.
[17:40:37] <Al_nz1> taplar: yes - but I havent got as far as trying to impliment the button in other places (yet)
[17:40:40] <Al_nz1> baby steps!
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> show us how it "didn't work"
[17:45:52] <Al_nz1> I have got this : https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/1/
[17:46:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/2/ with jquery included.
[17:46:20] <robertmaxrees> so what's broken?
[17:49:50] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/6/ when i send $surname to console (to check if it worked I just get [Object object]
[17:50:07] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.surname'); is the noder.
[17:50:09] <robertmaxrees> *node
[17:50:17] <robertmaxrees> you need to get the value of the input.
[17:50:33] <Al_nz1> yeah but I want to check I got the sorrect node?
[17:50:54] <Al_nz1> how would I check?
[17:50:55] <taplar> .prop('id') ?
[17:50:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:51:00] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[17:51:03] <robertmaxrees> you said it didn't work.
[17:51:27] <Al_nz1> when I saw Object object instead of DOM> whatever I figuered it was broken
[17:51:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:51:47] <Al_nz1> normally console.log( some selector) wil print the selected part of DOM to console
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> that's bnecause it's a jquery object.
[17:51:54] <robertmaxrees> not a raw dom node.
[17:52:06] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:52:11] <robertmaxrees> you're coercing it to a string.
[17:52:25] <robertmaxrees> console.log("surname" +$surname); -> console.log($surname);
[17:52:30] <robertmaxrees> that's how you get what you want.
[17:53:24] <Al_nz1> ahh - finally
[17:53:43] <Al_nz1> I dont really understand why "surname : " +$surname makes it a string though
[17:53:56] <taplar> string (concatenate) object
[17:54:09] <taplar> it has to figure out how to do that
[17:54:11] <robertmaxrees> because in JS, adding two things together means "i want to make this one object"
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> if they're both numbers, that's simple.
[17:54:27] <robertmaxrees> if it's anything else, what should it to?
[17:54:39] <Al_nz1> so if they are different it sends both to string?
[17:55:06] <robertmaxrees> there are more rules to it than that, but if you try to add something to a string, it'll coerce it to a string.
[17:55:17] <Al_nz1> ok
[17:55:43] <taplar> you could always drop a debugger; in there and look around instead of console logging
[17:55:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ your browser's debugger is pretty helpful.
[18:01:54] <Al_nz1> this seemed to work : Object.keys(result).forEach(function(key) { console.log($(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.' +key));
[18:02:20] <Al_nz1> have I got the '''s right on the find?
[18:03:06] <taplar> they just need to match.  doesn't matter which you use
[18:04:31] <Al_nz1> amaze balls - it worked
[18:05:15] <Al_nz1> So the next question becomes how I am going to do this with multiple search buttons - as you pointed out the id's need to be different
[18:06:06] <taplar> use a class
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> what did we suggest the other times?
[18:06:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:08:16] <Al_nz1> oh wait. nested selectors allowed? like : $('[name="' + $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.' +key)) + '"]').val(result[key]);
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:08:29] <Al_nz1> wait
[18:08:32] <taplar> don't use attribut eselectors
[18:08:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[18:08:42] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[18:08:45] <taplar> use a class/id/tagName
[18:09:00] <Al_nz1> ?
[18:09:09] <taplar> [name=""]
[18:09:14] <taplar> ^ attribute selector
[18:09:15] <robertmaxrees> ^ avoid these.
[18:09:23] <taplar> worst case, your going to perform a full dom scan
[18:09:33] <Al_nz1> so how would I write this function?
[18:09:34] <robertmaxrees> best case, it's still hard to read.
[18:09:35] <taplar> no optimization
[18:09:38] <taplar> heh
[18:09:46] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[18:09:57] <robertmaxrees> try updating the fiddle to show us.
[18:10:16] <Al_nz1> well results contains a JSON from the db
[18:10:27] <Al_nz1> I need to update corresponding inputs
[18:10:44] <robertmaxrees> show us an example of the json in the fiddle.
[18:12:36] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/08cn970q/
[18:13:21] <robertmaxrees> any way you could update the fiddle you already had before instead?
[18:13:47] <Al_nz1> so surname value needs to go into <input type="text" class="form-control surname" id="surname0" placeholder="surname" name="persons[0].surname" value="EASTWOOD">
[18:14:01] <robertmaxrees> >>>
[18:14:03] <robertmaxrees> *>.>
[18:14:55] * robertmaxrees throws up his hands
[18:14:57] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/8/
[18:15:44] <robertmaxrees> so https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/9/?
[18:15:49] <Al_nz1> the class names on the inputs will match the key names coming back in the json
[18:16:10] <taplar> so what can you do with that information
[18:18:21] <Al_nz1> I am trying to find the closest panel-body, and within that find class with matching keyname, then set the val
[18:18:30] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:18:45] <taplar> dooooo eeeeeeet
[18:18:54] <robertmaxrees> so if the names on the inputs match properties on the object...
[18:19:25] <Al_nz1> something like $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.' +key).val(result[key]);
[18:19:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:19:37] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[18:19:46] <robertmaxrees> why not get all the inputs and use an .each()?
[18:20:19] <Al_nz1> Object.keys(result).forEach(function(key) { $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.' +key).val(result[key]);
[18:20:27] <robertmaxrees> er.
[18:20:30] <Al_nz1> like that?
[18:20:40] <robertmaxrees> "why notr get all the inputs and use an each()?"
[18:20:50] <Al_nz1> oh you mean in the jquery.
[18:20:58] <robertmaxrees> also, that thing you just posted will fail.
[18:20:59] <Al_nz1> shoot - thats too advanced for me
[18:21:07] <robertmaxrees> on account of the address property.
[18:21:13] <robertmaxrees> how is that too advanced?  where'd i lose you?
[18:21:24] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: baby setps. I want to nail the surname first....
[18:21:34] <Al_nz1> then deal with the child object
[18:21:38] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:21:44] <robertmaxrees> there's a much easier way to do this.
[18:21:50] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to get all the inputs?
[18:21:56] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: no
[18:21:59] <robertmaxrees> really?
[18:22:07] <robertmaxrees> you know how to find the surname.
[18:22:10] <Al_nz1> yes
[18:22:30] <robertmaxrees> knowing how to do that, how would you get all the form-control elements?
[18:22:46] <robertmaxrees> assuming that's the class for the inputs.
[18:23:16] <Al_nz1> { $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.form-control'); ?
[18:23:40] <robertmaxrees> you already have $theForm.  so you can just do $theForm.find('.form-control')
[18:23:42] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[18:24:01] <Al_nz1> okay and then....
[18:24:09] <robertmaxrees> reread what i suggested.
[18:24:16] <robertmaxrees> and step through it piece by piece
[18:32:34] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: so what your suggesting is to do something like for each input in this('panel-body') find('.' +key )
[18:32:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:33:17] <robertmaxrees> no .find('.' + key)
[18:35:19] <Al_nz1> but you are saying a for each input in $(this).closest('.panel-body')
[18:35:39] <robertmaxrees> right.  they all share a class, don't they?
[18:36:46] <Al_nz1> so $(this).closest('.panel-body').each('.form control') {
[18:36:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:37:00] <robertmaxrees> .find('.form-control').each(
[18:37:49] <Al_nz1> $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.form-control).each {
[18:38:03] <Al_nz1> no dash
[18:38:17] <Al_nz1> $(this).closest('.panel-body').find('.form control).each {
[18:38:18] <robertmaxrees> "no dash"?
[18:38:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:38:29] <robertmaxrees> .form control doesn't make sense as a selector.
[18:38:49] <robertmaxrees> that looks for a <control> element that's a child of something with the class "form"
[18:39:07] <robertmaxrees> the html you shared earlier uses form-control
[18:39:41] <Al_nz1> I am lost
[18:40:06] <Al_nz1> find panel-body and for each form-control do something
[18:40:12] <Al_nz1> I think that this logic looks like
[18:40:26] <robertmaxrees> (update the fiddle)
[18:40:42] <robertmaxrees> (show me an actual concrete example)
[18:45:21] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/10/
[18:45:44] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:45:55] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[18:46:01] <robertmaxrees> each takes a function.
[18:47:05] <Al_nz1> what function would I want to pass to it? All I want to do is operate on each form-control
[18:47:27] <robertmaxrees> you could do an anonymous one.
[18:47:49] <Al_nz1> in the docs they have a index, but the actual index function is not shown
[18:47:52] <robertmaxrees> kinda like you do with click each on.
[18:47:57] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the index.
[18:48:09] <Al_nz1> I know i dont need index.
[18:48:13] <robertmaxrees> it's a lot like click in that $(this) refers back to the current element.
[18:48:20] <robertmaxrees> so then just pass it a function?
[18:48:31] <Al_nz1> so how would I pass it an anon function?
[18:48:39] <robertmaxrees> the same you do with .click()
[18:49:05] <robertmaxrees> *the same way you do with .click()
[18:49:16] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/11/
[18:49:43] <robertmaxrees> :(
[18:49:45] <robertmaxrees> really?
[18:49:58] <Al_nz1> thats what I have in the click
[18:50:10] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[18:50:14] <robertmaxrees> your parens don't match.
[18:50:59] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/12/
[18:51:08] <robertmaxrees> #boom
[18:51:46] <robertmaxrees> so what next?
[18:53:07] <Al_nz1> amaze balls
[18:53:19] <Al_nz1> ok, so next.....
[18:53:43] <Al_nz1> within that each I need to find the class name for the current this?
[18:54:09] <Al_nz1> and then get the corresponding result.value
[18:54:12] <robertmaxrees> eh, you could, but then you'll havbe to do some string manipulation to get the class you want.
[18:54:47] <Al_nz1> a better way?
[18:54:53] <robertmaxrees> lemme guess, the name property on the elements also matches the corresponding property in the object?
[18:55:59] <Al_nz1> No - remember I mentioned thymeleaf sets the name to the object? so my name=surname gets over written with name="person[0].surname"
[18:56:08] <Al_nz1> in the rendered view
[18:56:19] <robertmaxrees> can you add a data attribute that matches?
[18:56:30] <Al_nz1> data attribute?
[18:56:31] <robertmaxrees> or not have thymeleaf generate those names?
[18:56:31] <Al_nz1> like?
[18:56:54] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I need thymelead to do that - it binds the form on submission to the db
[18:57:09] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:57:23] <robertmaxrees> so then use a data attribute to do it.
[18:58:08] <Al_nz1> include data-surname inside the input?
[18:58:43] <robertmaxrees> nah, something like data-propertyname="surname"
[18:58:54] <Al_nz1> ahh i see
[18:59:11] <catbadger> I am back
[18:59:32] <robertmaxrees> wb
[18:59:36] <Al_nz1> but then I still need the logic inside the each to determine which property I am dealing with?
[18:59:52] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[19:00:11] <Al_nz1> $(this). <- then what?
[19:00:22] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery read data attribute
[19:00:38] <robertmaxrees> awww the bot's dead dead i forgot.
[19:00:46] <catbadger> ty
[19:00:52] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+read+data+attribute Al_nz1
[19:00:54] <catbadger> lol adn I'm gone again
[19:01:17] <Al_nz1> $(this).attr("data-propertyname") will return surname?
[19:01:40] <Al_nz1> or whatever one I am on
[19:01:41] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.  there's also .data('propertyname')
[19:01:44] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[19:01:59] <Al_nz1> OK...giving it a go
[19:11:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/19/
[19:11:21] <Al_nz1> that look pretty close?
[19:29:33] <robertmaxrees> super easy to test.
[19:29:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3hLmtkcw/20/
[19:30:27] <Al_nz1> w00t
[19:37:01] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: you have been most helpful and very patient.
[19:37:04] <Al_nz1> big thanks
[19:37:15] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[19:39:19] <robertmaxrees> what the channel is here for.
[19:47:12] <Al_nz1> oh shoot. i remember part two of the question - what do I do about address?
[19:48:08] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to check against a set of props and handle them differently.
[19:48:34] <robertmaxrees> i assume you have a set of inputs that map to the address property in that object?
[19:48:41] <Al_nz1> yes
[19:49:19] <Al_nz1> what is the syntax for acessng result.address.streetname for example
[19:49:30] <robertmaxrees> erm
[19:49:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:49:41] <Al_nz1> the json result
[19:49:47] <robertmaxrees> you just did it?
[19:49:48] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[19:49:51] <robertmaxrees> result.address.streetname
[19:49:55] <Al_nz1> lol. good guess
[19:50:02] <robertmaxrees> or w/e the json path is.
[19:50:55] <Al_nz1> but I have been using result[key] so shouldnt I have result[address.street]
[19:51:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd do result.address[propname] or w/e
[19:52:54] <Al_nz1> so inside my each on the form-control I need to have a if statement to test if (this).attr(data-property) = address { ...whatever
[19:53:13] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[19:54:15] <Al_nz1> once I hit the first address can I rely on the next 5 fields all being the address ones (assuming they come in the DOM in that order?)
[19:54:26] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[19:54:38] <robertmaxrees> nor would that really help the approach much.
[19:55:09] <Al_nz1> but I dont want 5 if statements....
[19:55:36] <robertmaxrees> you can make an array of exceptions and then check if the current one is in the array.
[19:57:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/c3w24e9z/
[19:58:26] <Al_nz1> right. And I guess I will need to do something similar for the select pickers since they dont have form-control
[19:58:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:58:49] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[19:58:53] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[19:59:30] <Al_nz1> i can set val on select picker?
[19:59:46] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about a normal <select> yeah?
[19:59:48] <Al_nz1> and just add form-control class?
[19:59:52] <Al_nz1> yeah
[20:00:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/s5ofpmcm/
[20:02:15] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[20:03:02] <Al_nz1> but again i need to test a list of exceptions to see if i am dealing with a select? or loop over select seperately?
[20:03:13] <robertmaxrees> why would you?
[20:03:39] <Al_nz1> ok, so no loop seperte? but still need to know if dealing with select vs input?
[20:03:41] <robertmaxrees> how is setting the val of the select different from setting the val of the text inputs?
[20:03:55] <Al_nz1> cause you have a diff jquery selector?
[20:04:24] <robertmaxrees> you realize that $('.some-class') and $('sometagname') will both return basically the same thing, right?
[20:04:42] <robertmaxrees> so if the selects have the same class as the text inputs, you're fine.
[20:05:04] <robertmaxrees> a jquery object is a jquery object.  the selector you give it doesn't matter much.
[20:05:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/s5ofpmcm/1/
[20:06:14] <robertmaxrees> no difference.
[20:06:21] <robertmaxrees> have you run through the learning center?
[20:08:08] <Al_nz1> yes, but I dont have form-control on select - let me add it and see what happens
[20:11:47] <Al_nz1> nah, I dont think its that simple.
[20:11:58] <Al_nz1> on my options the selected item looks like : <option value="Male" selected="selected">Male</option>
[20:12:10] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[20:12:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/s5ofpmcm/2/
[20:12:35] <robertmaxrees> still doesn't make a difference.
[20:14:53] <Al_nz1> twitter bootstrap
[20:14:58] <Al_nz1> might be different
[20:16:39] <robertmaxrees> what are the classes on the select?
[20:16:46] <Al_nz1> your fiddle is different to <option value="Male" selected="selected">Male</option>
[20:16:58] <robertmaxrees> selected="selected" accomplishes thje same thing.
[20:16:59] <Al_nz1> <select class="selectpicker form-control"
[20:17:04] <robertmaxrees> it's a boolean attribute
[20:17:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/L7vtt0tg/
[20:17:19] <robertmaxrees> same result.
[20:18:57] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[20:19:15] <robertmaxrees> are you even trying to figure these out on your own?
[20:20:13] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/L7vtt0tg/1/
[20:20:22] <Al_nz1> that doesnt work
[20:20:40] <Al_nz1> it works for all the inputs but not select pickers
[20:20:40] <robertmaxrees> data pls
[20:21:58] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/L7vtt0tg/2/
[20:23:05] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[20:23:15] <robertmaxrees> there a reason you're making me do a bunch of work to make it a frunctioning fiddle?
[20:23:31] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/L7vtt0tg/4/
[20:23:32] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[20:25:22] <Al_nz1> hmmm....
[20:26:01] <robertmaxrees> try debugging it.
[20:26:05] <robertmaxrees> log out the names and stuff.
[20:27:29] <Al_nz1> yeah will have to do that
[20:27:35] <Al_nz1> got to do the school run now
[20:27:36] <Al_nz1> bbl
[20:27:37] <Al_nz1> thanks

[20:27:44] <robertmaxrees> shoulda started there duder heh
[20:27:46] <robertmaxrees> bye
