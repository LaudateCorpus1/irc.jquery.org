[00:03:32] <juha___> snover: aged for 15 years inside a brazilian teenager
[00:03:32] <snover> Abjorn: that is shockingly accurate

[00:04:11] <TonkaTruck> hahahaha inside a brazilian teenager.
[00:04:18] <Abjorn> weak in caffeine, sure
[00:04:32] <juha___> it's like a party that i'm not invited in but i'm still dancing like a monkey on speed

[00:07:02] <TonkaTruck> haha wtf is jquery wiggle...I'm forking this.
[00:07:33] <Abjorn> jQuery Wiggle is the greatest plugin of all time.
[00:07:34] <Pascal-> mm
[00:07:39] <Abjorn> trufax
[00:07:56] <snover> star wipe is the only plugin you need.
[00:07:59] <TonkaTruck> I'm not sure I agree with the fixed algorithm.
[00:08:00] <Trisox> pff
[00:09:56] <TonkaTruck> The code for this makes me laugh as much as the results.  I like it.
[00:10:17] <Abjorn> lol
[00:12:20] <charlton> Abjorn:the wiggle reminds me of wave, moving horizontally across, what is this plugin used for?
[00:12:36] <Abjorn> oh it does everything you'd ever need
[00:12:50] <Abjorn> and by that I mean wiggle
[00:12:55] <coldhead> i use it for ecommerce
[00:12:57] <Abjorn> ^
[00:13:06] <coldhead> and for unit testing extreme programming
[00:13:10] <coldhead> oh and social media
[00:13:11] <TonkaTruck> hahahaha
[00:13:22] <Abjorn> I use it in banking applications
[00:13:35] <TonkaTruck> test driven development, loose coupling, etc
[00:13:38] <Abjorn> real number crunching, ya know?
[00:14:05] <charlton> real crunchy stuff
[00:14:08] <Zerxer> I installed it in my girlfriend, thx Abjorn!
[00:14:22] <Abjorn> your welcome! what a lucky lady
[00:14:33] <Zerxer> everyone loves a girl that wiggles
[00:14:42] <Abjorn> oh of course
[00:15:35] <charlton> looks like it can blend a iphone
[00:15:37] <Zerxer> now your website, too, can wiggle
[00:15:56] <Abjorn> someone made a wiggle bookmarklet lol i forgot who
[00:15:56] <Zerxer> ?wiggle
[00:16:08] <Zerxer> why is bot-t never here anymore
[00:16:13] <Abjorn> when you ran the bookmarklet it would wiggle everything on the page
[00:16:19] <Zerxer> can we get him to run on a dedicated server :(
[00:16:31] <Abjorn> yeah he's been MIA a lot lately
[00:16:39] <coldhead> bot-t is offline and his owner is too busy getting THE BEST SEX OF HER LIFE to do anything about it
[00:16:48] <Abjorn> o_o
[00:16:51] <coldhead> there's a spa and champagne and i doubt we;ll get either back any time soon
[00:16:56] <Abjorn> who is his owner
[00:17:00] <coldhead> i mean, this is what i imagine is happening
[00:17:04] <coldhead> it FEELS true
[00:17:06] <coldhead> temp01
[00:17:11] <Abjorn> o
[00:17:13] <Zerxer> I didn't know temp01 was a girl
[00:17:15] <Zerxer> but still
[00:17:18] <Zerxer> bot-t > everything in life
[00:17:26] <Abjorn> to be fair, you tend to assume anyone in an irc chatroom is male
[00:17:32] <Zerxer> indeed
[00:17:33] <Abjorn> unless given reason to think otherwise
[00:17:46] <juha___> coffee is awesome!
[00:17:47] <coldhead> people often assume i am male
[00:18:07] <juha___> i assumed that you are shemale
[00:18:19] <Zerxer> to be fair it's your first day at being female
[00:18:20] <Abjorn> I did until that one night we got really drunk and...oh wait, I'm not supposed to bring that up in public
[00:18:35] <juha___> Abjorn: you slut.
[00:19:23] <xec> man, what sort of channel did i stumble upon this morning
[00:19:30] <Abjorn> what can I say, you get some alcohol in my system and I get passed around like the chronic at a party
[00:19:38] <Abjorn> xec: the best one
[00:19:49] <xec> apparently! party on :P
[00:19:54] <juha___> xec: the most awesome (and gayest)
[00:20:28] <TonkaTruck> haha this channel is great...at all hours...

[00:26:02] <juha___> i once tried to be like coldhead, ended up with severe brain trauma
[00:26:20] <Abjorn> not many people can handle being as awesome as me and coldhead
[00:27:12] <juha___> well, you're easy, but try being coldhead, always livin upside down and fighting kangaroos

[00:29:04] <xec> Abjorn: very very early morning?
[00:30:22] <Abjorn> lol i guess technically?
[00:36:13] <Deele> how was optimized selector like this "#booksList .book a.bookDetails, #booksList .book a.bookTitle"
[00:42:23] <dravekx> anyone have a clue why my login box isnt showing with .toggle()? http://dravekx.dyndns.org/projects/dxMenu/
[00:46:33] <dravekx> nvm. had to change it fixed position
[00:49:49] <coldhead> TAROT READINGS: BETTER WITH POT? A CNN SPECIAL REPORT
[01:01:54] <mello> how would I select all input tags within a div?
[01:02:10] <dr0id> $('div input')
[01:02:17] <dr0id> it wasn't that hard. :|
[01:02:31] <mello> no.. but i just figured out i needed selects and not inputs :/
[01:02:44] <dr0id> $('div select')
[01:02:50] <dr0id> wasn't that hard either... :|
[01:02:53] <Clonix> :)
[01:02:56] <mello> no :p but i knew that one
[01:03:07] <dr0id> part please
[01:07:15] <juha___> mr. bombastic!
[01:08:34] <safani> Hey where could i find an irc for vbscript
[01:09:31] <coldhead> may god have mercy on your soul, safani
[01:09:35] <cirwin> is jQuery 1.6 completely backwards compatible with 1.4 ?
[01:09:49] <coldhead> of course not, cirwin
[01:09:56] <coldhead> if it were it would be the same thing
[01:10:00] <coldhead> ajax has changed
[01:10:03] <coldhead> attr has changed
[01:10:04] <dr0id> it's forward compatible though
[01:10:07] <coldhead> those are the biggies
[01:10:15] <coldhead> its "roughly" compatible
[01:10:20] <coldhead> its compatible for most things
[01:10:29] <coldhead> but not the same :(
[01:10:34] <coldhead> bugs are fixed, for example!
[01:10:38] <cirwin> assuming I was ignoring the return value from ajax calls, will the old mechanisms for adding callbacks still work?
[01:10:52] <coldhead> it should
[01:10:58] <cirwin> thanks
[01:11:03] <coldhead> its mostly if you;re doing something fancy with the XHR object it breaks
[01:11:09] <juha___> differences between 1.4 and 1.6 are like differences in chocolate icecream and chunky chocolate icecream
[01:11:22] <coldhead> mmm chunks
[01:13:48] <Deele> is BBQ url history modification only avilable via anchor names?
[01:17:27] <spixy> hi people...
[01:17:31] <spixy> can i ask some things
[01:18:01] <cirwin> spixy: of course
[01:18:07] <dr0id> no, you cannot
[01:18:09] <spixy> okay,,,
[01:18:13] <spixy> here is my question
[01:18:18] <dr0id> no wait
[01:18:34] <Benjamin__> lol
[01:18:35] <spixy> whats wrong with this..
[01:18:39] <spixy> <script>
[01:18:39] <spixy>   $("#new-nav").load("http://api.jquery.com/load #jq-footerNavigation li");
[01:18:39] <spixy> </script>
[01:18:52] <spixy> i was trying to learn load()
[01:19:26] <cirwin> spixy: you probably want to wrap that in a jQuery function so that it doesn't try to run until after the document is ready
[01:19:34] <coldhead> you can't do ajax across servers, spixy
[01:19:53] <spixy> i created a html page and i want a div to load a part of that url
[01:20:05] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[01:20:26] <spixy> so it needs to be on the same server?
[01:20:29] <coldhead> yes
[01:20:46] <coldhead> do you want access to api.jquery.com ?
[01:21:00] <spixy> no i just want to do a sample..
[01:21:14] <coldhead> use the same domain as your code then
[01:21:22] <spixy> what if i created two html page...
[01:21:26] <coldhead> in fact don't even specify the domain
[01:21:40] <spixy> 1st html contains the load()
[01:21:43] <coldhead> just $(whatever).load('lolaids.html #etc etc')
[01:21:49] <spixy> 2nd contains the selector
[01:22:11] <spixy> whatever = where to place
[01:22:22] <spixy> lolaids = where to get
[01:22:27] <coldhead> yes
[01:22:32] <spixy> #etc = what to get?
[01:22:32] <JusticeFries> hey coldhead
[01:22:46] <coldhead> good blindingly early morning, JusticeFries
[01:22:49] <JusticeFries> can't sleep. :/
[01:22:55] <coldhead> so it would seem
[01:23:11] <spixy> but it seem that it do not work on me...
[01:23:29] <coldhead> can you paste your code on jsfiddle.net, spixy ?
[01:23:31] <coldhead> or similar?
[01:23:50] <spixy> okay...gimme a minute
[01:25:46] <spixy> here http://tinypaste.com/f6145
[01:26:51] <JusticeFries> i'm on a helpspree in rubyonrails
[01:26:59] <Deele> Is there any other method for address bar tampering, than use of anchor names, which is used by jQ BBQ?
[01:27:12] <cirwin> Deele: in HTML5, yes
[01:27:24] <spixy> coldhead...
[01:27:37] <Deele> cirwin and in <HTML5
[01:27:40] <JusticeFries> coldhead is in a remote place, his bits travel slower.
[01:28:00] <spixy> lol..
[01:28:02] <cirwin> Deele: not really
[01:28:33] <coldhead> also i am terribly drunk
[01:28:37] <coldhead> spixy: maybe you mean $("#new-content").load("secondary.html #selector li"); ?
[01:28:50] <coldhead> instead of $('#new-nav') ?
[01:29:01] <spixy> oh yes
[01:29:08] <coldhead> $('#new-nav').length == 0
[01:29:22] <Deele> cirwin, and how is it supported in HTML5?
[01:29:34] <spixy> do i need to add that length?
[01:29:42] <coldhead> no spixy
[01:29:53] <coldhead> that was just my description of your problem in js
[01:29:58] <cirwin> http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html
[01:30:09] <Deele> thx
[01:30:16] <spixy> so whats the problem specifically
[01:30:23] <JusticeFries> ...the div you were selecting isn't on the page.
[01:30:24] <JusticeFries> :)
[01:30:26] <coldhead> your selector doesn't matching
[01:30:31] <coldhead> match*
[01:30:53] <coldhead> it is looking for <div id="new-nav"></div>
[01:31:00] <coldhead> and the browser is like "NEVER FUCKING HEARD OF IT"
[01:31:00] <JusticeFries> aaaaalso.
[01:31:04] <JusticeFries> there's no #selector li
[01:31:07] <JusticeFries> page 2:
[01:31:12] <coldhead> "HERE IS MORE PORN"
[01:31:13] <JusticeFries> $('#selector li').length == 0
[01:31:30] <spixy> so let me edit it...
[01:31:34] <coldhead> go ahead
[01:31:37] <spixy> brb
[01:31:41] <coldhead> i am going to attend to my nosebleed
[01:32:11] <spixy> can you edit the link i gave..
[01:32:47] <spixy> click new version
[01:32:51] <spixy> to edit
[01:32:52] <JusticeFries> http://tinypaste.com/4d89b
[01:33:05] <spixy> let me see
[01:33:08] <JusticeFries> also, I'm tired.
[01:34:03] <spixy> hahha...
[01:34:06] <spixy> it worked..
[01:34:15] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[01:34:28] <JusticeFries> exhausted, I provide undying support in both jquery and rails.
[01:34:37] <spixy> i just started learning jquery now..hahaha
[01:35:06] <spixy> i'll be here always incase i needed support..
[01:35:07] <JusticeFries> coldhead I'm hopefully speaking at GothamJS. :D
[01:35:08] <spixy> hehehe
[01:35:33] <MoTiOnXml> somebody should fix the topic to 1.6.1
[01:35:42] <MoTiOnXml> with the attr/prop fix
[01:35:54] <coldhead> spixy: it's my first day using jquery
[01:36:04] <coldhead> JusticeFries: you are HOGGING all the confs
[01:36:11] <coldhead> soon i will have to contact your PA to contact you
[01:36:24] <spixy> hahaha.thanks for correction...
[01:36:25] <coldhead> "oh he's in bolivia speaking to child miners"
[01:36:42] <coldhead> spixy: no it is actually my first day using jquery
[01:36:53] <spixy> really?
[01:37:08] <coldhead> yes
[01:37:11] <coldhead> honest and true!
[01:37:13] <spixy> wow...
[01:37:17] <coldhead> i have been reading the manual all day
[01:37:29] <coldhead> its really easy to learn
[01:37:38] <spixy> oh..ive been watching a tut on net.tutsplus
[01:37:40] <coldhead> and people here are so helpful
[01:37:51] <coldhead> except for those jerks
[01:37:55] * coldhead spits on the jerks
[01:38:03] <spixy> hahaha...
[01:38:08] <JusticeFries> well
[01:38:14] <JusticeFries> the child miners need some inspiration
[01:38:18] <spixy> so can you create you own plugin now?
[01:41:32] <coldhead> not yet spixy but i bookmarked the tutorial on how to!
[01:41:46] <coldhead> do you want the link?
[01:43:48] <Altreus> will $('*') find <html>?
[01:45:27] <g4> can anyone recommend a good gallery jquery plugin? Hopefully something that handles the portrait/landscape resize issue for good grid layout.
[01:45:35] <xec> Altreus:  yes, but even better would be $('html') :P
[01:46:01] <Altreus> xec: Actually I wanted to know what to put into .not() :)
[01:46:28] <Altreus> Actually I'm going to have to be smarter anyway
[01:46:34] <coldhead> please do
[01:46:36] <Altreus> I hate being smart
[01:46:38] <Altreus> it hurts
[01:47:52] <coldhead> be smart and lazy and efficient
[01:47:55] <coldhead> and readable
[01:48:03] <coldhead> but don't select every element in the DOM
[01:48:21] <coldhead> that steenks
[01:48:37] <VictorCL> xD
[01:51:11] <Altreus> I'm trying to clean up the DOM because I need to save HTML. Trouble is, some people's Chrome extensions are adding DOM elements I wasn't expecting.
[01:51:19] <Altreus> So now I have to do it by whitelist instead of blacklist, basically
[01:51:24] <Altreus> not really sure how to do it -_-
[01:51:32] <Altreus> even if I could find a pattern
[01:51:39] <Altreus> oh! I think I have it
[01:51:44] <Altreus> \o/ problem ducks
[01:52:11] <coldhead> good luck Altreus
[01:54:09] <coldhead> see you in hell, spixy
[01:54:55] <sveri> hi there, i am using 1.4.2 and the autocomplete plugin, as soon as i use the mustmatch variable i have the problem that the selected text gets filled into the input field, and about 0.1s later the input field is empty again: http://pastebin.ca/2061086
[01:59:31] <dravekx> fiddle is down?
[02:00:02] <Cork> yup
[02:02:45] <dravekx> anyone know a better way to write this so it passes w3c validation? I cant use #. http://pastebin.com/h9SsvDqi
[02:12:19] <astropirate> dravekx, id="#sub1" is wrong  you don't write the # int he actual element that is just a CSS selector for id
[02:12:35] <Guest96100> I've got a problem with navigation in jqmobile a4.1... I've got two data-role="page" pages, each linking to the other... navigation works only once, in the scenario: page1 -> page 2, page2 -> page1, page1 -> page2 .... aaand stop. The link do thee page1 is dead. But there are other links to page1 on page2 and they work ok. It looks like it's working only once
[02:13:10] <cool123> http://www.clickstudio.info/edilalwebsite/search-result/
[02:13:12] <cool123> anyone know how to fix the pagination problem
[02:13:32] <Guest96100> oh, and when clicking on the said link on page1 the url looks ok, i mean, it is xxx.html#page1-id
[02:17:36] <cool123> emmm...
[02:17:54] <cool123> #/s100p2
[02:18:06] <cool123> this is automatically from the plug in
[02:18:11] <marcusl> Hi!
[02:18:54] <marcusl> I have to maintain some older jQuery code. It contains "return false" in its event handlers. Does that do anything at all?
[02:19:05] <marcusl> I cannot find anything about this.
[02:19:14] <marcusl> Could you please enlighten me?
[02:20:03] <marcusl> for example $("#myid").click(function () { ... return false; })
[02:21:29] <marcusl> ok found it
[02:21:31] <marcusl> nevermind
[02:22:00] <PeterB> morning
[02:22:20] <PeterB> I need to add classes to odd and even table rows; is it going to be more efficient to:
[02:22:31] <PeterB> a) add the odd class to every row, then the even ones to :even?
[02:22:43] <PeterB> b) add the odd class using :odd, then the even class using :even?
[02:22:49] <PeterB> My guess is a) will be faster
[02:23:36] <dravekx> astropirate, I tried without the character but it stops working :S
[02:32:13] <Altreus> what's the most efficient way of cloning a node but not its children? i.e. just its attributes
[02:32:37] <SoulRaven> hi
[02:32:39] <thatboyjim> does anyone have any experience of jquery autocomplete?
[02:33:03] <Guest96100> Altreus: $('#element').attributes ?
[02:33:07] <SoulRaven> is it posibile using ui dialog, to append a content to a div, and display it ussing ui dialog from juqery?
[02:33:12] <SoulRaven> @juery
[02:33:15] <Altreus> is there such a thing!
[02:33:25] <Altreus> Guest96100: oh right, that old-fashioned pure JS thing
[02:34:00] <thatboyjim> does anyone know how to invoke autocomplete manually (i.e. supply string without doing it through an input field)?
[02:34:44] <dravekx> ahhhh
[02:34:48] <dravekx> got it! :D
[02:36:51] <Murugaratham> anyone knows why does $().jquery returns 1.3.1 when i already used a 1.6 library?
[02:42:23] <mryall> Murugaratham: seems unlikely that there's a bug in that property - perhaps you have two copies loaded in the page somehow?
[02:42:32] <Murugaratham> im trying :\
[02:43:04] <cool123> mryall any idea regarding my problem
[02:48:04] <Guest96100> anyone has experience with this error: "Uncaught cannot call methods on actionsheet prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'". I'm using an actionsheet plugin for jquery mobilem and I'm getting this error when I try programatically display said actionsheet (like that:  jQuery('#x').actionsheet('open'); )
[02:48:42] <thom__> hello everyone..
[02:49:10] <dtach> i need some advice, i have a site that is divided in two, so theres 1 main div with the site in it, 100% x 100% and another one above it (hidden from sight) also 100%x100% and at some point when the user is done i want the 2nd div to slide down, what is the best way of doing this?
[02:57:30] <SoulRaven> how i change the mouse curson, when i click an action, from ui dialog?
[02:58:16] <sean`> SoulRaven, using css
[02:58:21] <dtach> SoulRaven: .css('cursor', 'any');
[02:59:27] <albacker> when im posting using $.post(), with jquery i can't access the POST variables in django (in the views), anyone can give me a hint?
[02:59:35] <albacker>    $.post( url, { "w": words } , this is the jquery line
[02:59:46] <albacker> and later is the function(data) of the response
[03:01:37] <SoulRaven> .addClass( 'curson', 'hand' );
[03:01:38] <SoulRaven> ?
[03:01:40] <SoulRaven> like this?
[03:02:02] <dtach> SoulRaven: i gave you the line :p
[03:05:24] <dtach> and isnt hand actually 'pointer'
[03:05:50] <SoulRaven> thx:)
[03:06:14] <dtach> np :)
[03:06:34] <dtach> you could probably set it in the css file itself too you know, just find out which class name it has
[03:06:56] <dtach> then add cursor:pointer;
[03:07:17] <Murugaratham> how do i print all the exception & options for ,ajax calls?
[03:12:03] <MatthiasVance> Hmm I wonder why the jQuery UI Dialog doesn't have an option for "do not allow the user to close this dialog".
[03:12:15] <voltagex> hi - when I define a function for .addClass, how do I specify that I want a class to be added, and to which elements?
[03:12:24] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: because that's Evil UI design
[03:12:35] <MatthiasVance> voltagex: But it's a login box!
[03:12:51] <MatthiasVance> And it's the start of the web app, so there is no other way to go.
[03:12:53] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: so if they close it, they don't get to log in
[03:13:18] <MatthiasVance> That's inconvenient.
[03:13:38] <voltagex> it's more inconvenient if you manage to spawn something that I can't close
[03:13:49] <voltagex> that gets you added to my AdBlock filter pretty quickly.
[03:13:55] <MatthiasVance> voltagex: You are misunderstanding.
[03:14:03] <MatthiasVance> voltagex: This is a dialog IN a page.
[03:14:09] <voltagex> yes
[03:14:15] <MatthiasVance> You can close it by closing the page ..
[03:14:21] <voltagex> and a close button is always rendered?
[03:14:22] <MatthiasVance> And if you did not want to log in, you should just close the page.
[03:14:42] <walid> hi all!
[03:14:53] <walid> i'm having trouble using jScrollPane
[03:15:12] <walid> i worked just perfect, i have no idea what i changed, now it doesn't anymore
[03:15:29] <walid> it's seems pretty straight fwd how to use it
[03:15:40] <walid> but i must be missing smth.. :(
[03:15:56] <walid> what i did is:
[03:16:01] <MatthiasVance> voltagex: It seems you are misunderstanding what I'm trying to do. Currently, this is what the main page of our web application looks like => http://screencast.com/t/G5DQg8pv9fu
[03:16:45] <walid> set a height to my div, set it's overflow to auto, and then call myDiv.jsScrollPane();
[03:17:15] <walid> but i get an error( 'g undefined), and two different behaviours on two different sites..
[03:17:22] <walid> can anyone help?
[03:17:23] <walid> :)
[03:17:35] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: ok, so how are the users closing it?
[03:17:45] <MatthiasVance> Why would they want to close it?
[03:17:56] <MatthiasVance> This is the web application, if you want to close it, you just close the tab / web page?
[03:18:32] <MatthiasVance> You almost seem to be trolling.
[03:19:32] <isaqual> Hi, how I should escape inner square brackets like this example -> var label = $("label[for=things[]]").text();
[03:19:39] <wolfe> this is probably a repetitive and annoying question ;)
[03:19:54] <wolfe> Rounded corners... is there a method for panels?
[03:19:54] <voltagex> "the jQuery UI Dialog doesn't have an option for "do not allow the user to close this dialog"."
[03:20:15] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: what is the issue you're having, I'm not trolling, I'm just having trouble understanding
[03:20:20] <sac> isaqual, $('label[for="things[]"]')
[03:20:45] <MatthiasVance> voltagex: Okay, well, the issue for this particular dialog (not any dialog afterwards), is that the user should not be able to close it. See it as a login "form" that is on a web page.
[03:20:59] <MatthiasVance> I solved the issue with $("a.ui-dialog-titlebar-close").remove() by the way.
[03:21:10] <sean`> sac, escape those []
[03:21:13] <isaqual> sac: Worked, thanks:)
[03:21:26] <walid> anyone familiar with jScrollPane?
[03:21:29] <sac> sean`, wat? it should work fine :)
[03:21:51] <wolfe> oh look, a whole section in docs x)
[03:22:12] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: and they are closing it by doing.....?
[03:22:21] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: oh
[03:22:23] <MatthiasVance> voltagex: I don't get that question you keep asking.
[03:22:30] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: right, that's what I was going to suggest
[03:22:37] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: removing the close button
[03:22:40] <MatthiasVance> Indeed.
[03:22:47] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: apologies, I understand now.
[03:23:03] <MatthiasVance> That's okay, thanks for thinking along.
[03:23:11] <MatthiasVance> I might as well have been terribly wrong.
[03:23:43] <wolfe> which is broken...
[03:24:43] <voltagex> MatthiasVance: I guess the fix would be to add a parameter to wherever the close button gets created - and don't render it if it's set to false
[03:24:52] <MatthiasVance> Indeed!
[03:29:08] <novitololo> Hi. I've a question regarding UI-Tabs.  I have a php page encoded in iso-8859-1.  If I have divs in the page with accents like (á,á) they are shown ok.  But if those divs are in another file (AJAX call), the accents are not shown...
[03:30:55] <ablomen> novitololo, _always_ use utf-8 for the interwebz
[03:31:18] <novitololo> ablomen: I know that. But I received this web in this charset.
[03:31:44] <bittyx-laptop> hello. i have the following code (simplified to a basic "doesn't work" example): http://jsfiddle.net/uhnky/ --- what i'd like to do is hide all categories that don't match a given tag (which is stored in var itemsShown), as well as all items that don't match it, but i can't seem to get it right. i understand it's a logic problem, but i've been looking at it for too long and i can't see why it doesn't work. can anyone help?
[03:32:21] <bittyx-laptop> by "categories that don't match a given tag", i mean, of course, "categories that have no items that match a given tag"
[03:33:02] <ablomen> novitololo, then convert them, there should be batch scripts for your os available
[03:33:16] <Trisox> anyone experience with cufon and white background rendering?
[03:33:21] <novitololo> ok ablomen
[03:33:26] <novitololo> but then do you think that's the problem?
[03:33:49] <ablomen> i think so, only way to be sure is to try :)
[03:34:24] <novitololo> I've tried it already, that's why I'm surprised you think is that
[03:34:41] <bittyx-laptop> basically, i'm trying to match everything that's not a category that :has() the given tag, as well as every item that doesn't have this tag as well (where tags are given as classes), and hide it. but the category hiding seems to work, whereas, if there's at least one item with a given tag in a category, than the category and *all* of it's items are shown (as opposed to just the ones that match the tag)
[03:36:48] <ablomen> novitololo, if everything (js, html, database connection, etc) is in utf-8 all should be good, though a good way to make sure is just to always use html character codes (&eacute; etc)
[03:37:14] <novitololo> yes...
[03:37:26] <novitololo> I'm going to try modifying the ajaxoptions of the tab call
[03:39:02] <bittyx-laptop> ohh, i've got it! this is what i want -> http://jsfiddle.net/kXWAx/ --- heh, it became so simple once i've asked for help. nevermind.
[03:46:53] <espebje> hey guys. I got a problem with some javascript.. might not be jQuery thoguh.. We got a input field where a user types in a title for a survey. This it not saved until he has been through multiple jQuery UI "lightboxes". But when it saves it seems to randomly add jQuery1510(and a buinch of other numbers) then underscore then a bunch of other random numbers.. Anyone experienced this problem?
[03:50:50] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to display a hourglass in time when the load function get the data?
[03:51:14] <SoulRaven> or display if i am ussing the $.get function
[03:51:24] <dtach> SoulRaven: yes its called 'wait'
[03:51:53] <SoulRaven> is a method or a function jquery?
[03:52:21] <dtach> .. dude
[03:52:25] <dtach> its just like pointer
[03:52:51] <MatthiasVance> I think he means an icon on the webpage, instead of changing the cursor.
[03:53:29] <sean`> SoulRaven, do you want to change the cursor or do you want to display an image, indicdating a wait?
[03:53:31] <dtach> SoulRaven: do you?
[03:53:55] <dtach> $("body *").css('cursor', 'wait'); might work :p
[03:53:56] <sean`> In it's the latter, you use a simple element, with an animating background
[03:54:01] <SoulRaven> MatthiasVance: no, i want to display the dialog, and in this dialog to display something before the data from load or get is been fetched
[03:54:02] <sean`> If*
[03:54:09] <dtach> *cough*
[03:54:21] <sean`> SoulRaven, http://ajaxload.info/
[03:54:24] <dtach> ah
[03:54:24] <SoulRaven> like a wheel progress, or some animation
[03:54:32] <dtach> yeah use ajaxload
[03:54:37] <alaing> hi I'm using Jquery ui 1.8.1 by an chance does any one know if there is a method to set a specific tab as the current one?
[03:54:37] <MatthiasVance> SoulRaven: That is what I meant.
[03:54:53] <SoulRaven> MatthiasVance: yes, you are right:)
[03:55:30] <SoulRaven> but how i integrate, in ajax load....i am ussing now ("#tabs-1").load("dashboards/capture", function(response, status, xhr) {
[03:55:36] <AdvoWork> ive just added the link to jquery 1.6, as soon as i refresh my page, firebug stops the code, on line:  31 _jQuery = window.jQuery,   any ideas please?
[03:57:13] <espebje> hey, on <input type="text"> field jQuery somehow adds a jQuery+(bunch of random numbers) ie jQuery1255832235_235325325 after the text in the input field. Anyone experienced this or know a issues?
[03:57:21] <sean`> .seen sugaslide
[03:57:22] <hsbot> sugaslide was seen 1 week, 5 days and 2 hours ago, leaving #jquery
[03:57:54] <scratcha> hey guys, when downloaded jquery UI, can anyone tell me what components are required so as i can use ui-corner's ?
[03:58:14] <msafi> How can detect if a text wraps around in an element (i.e. string width is wider than containing div)?
[03:59:02] <SarahX> hai
[04:00:41] <sean`> scratcha, border-radius support
[04:00:53] <scratcha> any idea what component that falls under?
[04:01:04] <sean`> scratcha, css, it's supported by the browser or not
[04:01:27] <scratcha> sean`: in relation to customising a jquery ui download, components as displayed here http://jqueryui.com/download
[04:01:55] <finbrein> how do you guys demonstrate a jquery project to a potential employer, I've got a couple of projects on my local machine
[04:01:56] <sean`> scratcha, it's in the default CSS afaik
[04:01:59] <SarahX> get ya javascripting onnnn
[04:02:13] <sean`> finbrein, upload and link
[04:02:29] <walid> hi, i would like to select all class="blog-type" except the ones that also have class="myTag". How can I achieve this?
[04:02:36] <finbrein> I used Github but the user is not set up for that
[04:02:56] <sean`> finbrein, if he's gonna give you money, better work for it
[04:03:14] <finbrein> he is looking for another means for him to see some of those projects i'm proud of
[04:03:40] <scratcha> sean`: you were right, thanks
[04:05:03] <finbrein> other means
[04:05:28] <alaing> hi I'm using Jquery ui 1.8.1 by any chance does any one know if there is a function to set a specific tab as the current one?
[04:06:42] <markj> alaing you want to use .tabs('select' index)
[04:06:57] <markj> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-select
[04:07:12] <alaing> hmm i see what you mean
[04:07:15] <markj> link doesnt work properly but look under the methods tab
[04:07:51] <alaing> markj:  I tried that and it doesn't seem to work when the page first loads up
[04:07:52] <markj> should be a comma after 'select' so follow the site example not mine
[04:08:07] <markj> oh right
[04:08:15] <markj> onload you mean, use the selected option
[04:08:17] <alaing> markj:  I see
[04:08:39] <alaing> markj: let me explain it a bit more in detail
[04:08:44] <glupek> Hello. Can I load content of another .html file and replace my page with that without actually reloading it (in the background)?
[04:09:44] <alaing> I need the tabs to work as follows. A user clicks on the tab and the page is submit when the page loads again the last sleected tab is displayed
[04:09:51] <markj> ?load @ glupek
[04:10:17] <markj> no bot today it seems :[
[04:10:38] <glupek> markj: I don't understand.
[04:11:05] <alaing> markj:  bot has gone on holiday. he forgot to put his out of office on
[04:11:40] <markj> http://api.jquery.com/load/ glupek, basically it replaces a div with the contents of another html file
[04:12:20] <glupek> markj: Yes, that's what I wanted. Thank you : ).
[04:12:21] <Aamir> alaing:  cookies :)
[04:12:54] <alaing> Aamir why thanks for the offer. i woudl like choc-chip please
[04:14:28] <Aamir> alaing:  :)  there is only on js-cookie flavour / set a cookie of selected tab and restore ur selected tab later
[04:15:14] <alaing> Aamir: let me try
[04:16:58] <alaing> I tried $myTabs.tabs({'select',$(':hidden').val()}).tabs({'select',function(e,ui){submitPage(ui.index);}});
[04:17:16] <alaing> submitPage passes the id to my hidden item
[04:17:38] <alaing> but it still keeps taken me to the first tab
[04:18:10] <alaing> brb fresh bread is ready so dont want to burn it.
[04:18:20] <stenno> hi bhavesh :)
[04:18:29] <bhavesh> stenno: hi :)
[04:18:54] <bhavesh> stenno: well I replaced my left and righ keys with up and down so the ID's were 38 and 40
[04:19:00] <finbrein> thanks sean
[04:19:05] <stenno> ok nice
[04:19:10] <stenno> still works i presume?
[04:19:12] <bhavesh> and did .animate({ 'top and bottom
[04:19:19] <bhavesh> it just mvoes up..
[04:19:22] <alaing> back
[04:19:29] <stenno> there is no 'bottom'
[04:19:42] <stenno> just do it like the 'left' one
[04:19:52] <bhavesh> ok
[04:19:52] <stenno> top += 100 and top -= 100
[04:20:01] <bhavesh> Got it
[04:20:25] <stenno> nice
[04:20:32] <bhavesh> ty :) jQuery seems much more easy
[04:20:34] <alaing> Aamir: any ideas?
[04:20:55] <bhavesh> in Javascript I had to use a huge code
[04:21:07] <stenno> bhavesh, yes its ultra-convenient :) no comparison against vanilla js
[04:21:15] <bhavesh> lol
[04:21:27] <Aamir> alaing:  demo?
[04:21:44] <stenno> i really like .animate
[04:21:57] <stenno> js> 23
[04:21:59] <stenno> ah
[04:22:20] <alaing> I cant give you a link to my site as its on an intranet and I cant put it on jsfiddle because it only uses a more recent ui
[04:22:47] <alaing> am i right in calling two different .tabs?
[04:22:58] <alaing> $myTabs.tabs({'select',$(':hidden').val()}).tabs({'select',function(e,ui){submitPage(ui.index);}});
[04:23:46] <Aamir> alaing:  busy at work sorry, but once a tab is selected, set a cookie and when page is loaded, load tabs, check the cookie if found than take the value and select the tab use .tabs('select'..
[04:25:43] <alaing> Aamir: yeah no problem thanks for your help any way. I just reading up on the cookie methods that ui.tabs uses.
[04:26:41] <MatthiasVance> Is there any easy way to load up a jquery ui dialog with a remote text?
[04:26:46] <Aamir> alaing:  yeah.. :) http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#cookie
[04:27:01] <MatthiasVance> dialog() expects to be called 'on' the target element to use
[04:27:17] <stenno> bhavesh, did you know that you can not only animate html tags, but also of course any other js object too? like this $({x: 23}).animate({'x': '+=19'}); will return {x: 42} ?
[04:27:29] <stenno> any jquery object
[04:27:50] <bhavesh> stenno: nope
[04:28:02] <stenno> i think thats awesome :>
[04:28:13] <bhavesh> yeah
[04:28:23] <alaing> MatthiasVance: you can use $('<div>').load(//some remote text'.dialog()
[04:28:33] <MatthiasVance> Thanks!
[04:28:39] <MatthiasVance> I was just figuring that out. ^^
[04:29:05] <alaing> this creates a new div. load in your text using ajax and then call the dialog method on your new div. no need to attach it of anything
[04:30:07] <MatthiasVance> alaing: Yeah I understood it. Thanks. :)
[04:30:35] <alaing> np
[04:31:07] <bhavesh> stenno: how can I define framework  in my normal HTML page?
[04:31:20] <MatthiasVance> alaing: Do you also know of a way to change the contents of a dialog after creating one?
[04:31:42] <MatthiasVance> Flows in jQuery still feel a bit awkward .
[04:31:54] <diegoviola> hi
[04:32:13] <amit_usual> how can i get the value of input box by id
[04:32:38] <MatthiasVance> amit_usual: $("input#id").value?
[04:32:50] <MatthiasVance> you can remove the input part
[04:32:54] <quicksilver> MatthiasVance: .val() ?
[04:32:55] <diegoviola> i'm trying to send the id of a select element as an ajax request, i'm trying with: data: ({id : this.getAttribute('id')})
[04:32:56] <alaing> no its .val
[04:32:59] <MatthiasVance> Ah, okay.
[04:33:02] <diegoviola> but it's not getting the id, any ideas?
[04:33:21] <quicksilver> diegoviola: is "this" a jQuery object or a DOM object?
[04:33:24] <alaing> MatthiasVance: change the content?
[04:33:34] <alaing> you can .load the content in
[04:33:38] <quicksilver> if the former, this[0].id or this.attr('id'). If the latter, this.id.
[04:33:50] <MatthiasVance> alaing: Yeah but I meant, after that. Ah, I should probably cache the element before.
[04:34:01] <amit_usual> MatthiasVance .val as well as .value give be undefined
[04:34:14] <alaing> MatthiasVance: yo ucan store the content in a .data
[04:34:20] <diegoviola> quicksilver: how can i know?
[04:34:30] <alaing> and then if .data does not exist do the ajax else use .data
[04:34:44] <quicksilver> diegoviola: you are the programmer. You should know the difference between a jQuery object and  DOM object. If you don't, I'm not sure I can help you :P
[04:34:46] <alaing> amit_usual: its .val()
[04:35:06] <amit_usual> alaing : i did .val() as well
[04:35:18] <alaing> $('#id").val()
[04:35:28] <diegoviola> quicksilver: well i'm trying to learn
[04:35:32] <alaing> amit_usual: is jquery loaded?
[04:35:44] <amit_usual> alert($('input#id_occurences_all').val()); and alert($('id_occurences_all').val());
[04:35:57] <amit_usual> alaing i have tried both
[04:36:10] <alaing> amit_usual: maybe there is something wrong with your selector
[04:36:14] <amit_usual> alaing yes i have other functions running
[04:36:14] <MatthiasVance> In the second example, you are forgetting #
[04:36:30] <alaing> try alert($('#myID').length)
[04:36:42] <amit_usual> alaing what i can do for that
[04:36:44] <diegoviola> how do i get the id of a select element to send it with my ajax request as an argument?
[04:36:47] <diegoviola> please
[04:37:02] <alaing> it will tell you if it found your element
[04:37:25] <amit_usual> alaing it is giving 0
[04:37:32] <amit_usual> for .length
[04:37:55] <bhavesh> stenno: that code isnt working in my normal HTML :(
[04:38:09] <bhavesh> what are these? //]]>	
[04:38:38] <workmad3> bhavesh: closing a CDATA tag in a JS comment... you shouldn't need it anymore
[04:38:49] <bhavesh> ok
[04:39:29] <alaing> amit_usual: then it means it cant find your element
[04:39:34] <dr0id> who is using CDATA ?
[04:39:40] <alaing> not me
[04:39:49] <stenno> bhavesh, simply with <script src='url.to.jquery'></script>
[04:40:00] <bhavesh> stenno: I did
[04:40:11] <stenno> maybe you could provide another jsfiddle?
[04:40:21] <stenno> this time with the framework in the markup?
[04:40:23] <bhavesh> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.min.js">
[04:40:37] <stenno> (which won't work in jsfiddle)
[04:40:38] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[04:40:47] <stenno> bhavesh, do you close it too?
[04:41:01] <bhavesh> yes ofc
[04:41:13] <stenno> you should have it available then
[04:41:16] <bhavesh> trying again.. on a new page
[04:41:22] <alaing> amit_usual: what is input#id_occurences_all.  do you have a input element with an if of "id_occurrences_all
[04:41:25] <stenno> do you bind the handler on $(document).ready ?
[04:42:10] <stenno> bhavesh, provide some code! then i may help you
[04:42:22] <stenno> or do you want to figure it out yourself? :)
[04:42:23] <amit_usual> alaing i got the problem it was wrong name of id ... but .length was a good way to debug thanks
[04:42:55] <bhavesh> stenno: 1 sec
[04:43:02] <stenno> ok
[04:43:07] <MatthiasVance> Bah! .load() wasn't calling .toString() on the object
[04:43:13] <MatthiasVance> (I was passing in a custom Uri object)
[04:43:43] <bhavesh> stenno: should i do something like <body onload="init()" > ?
[04:43:47] <alaing> amit_usual: do you use firefox?
[04:43:57] <amit_usual> alaing yes
[04:43:58] <stenno> bhavesh, you do it a little bit different in jquery
[04:44:07] <alaing> get firebug
[04:44:09] <hermanus> ha, there's a jquery channel, nice. I got a question. I want to save a jquery object in a DB, what would be the best way to do that? i cannot use serialize on an object
[04:44:26] <stenno> bhavesh, you don't bind anything on onload
[04:44:56] <stenno> but on $(document).ready in another <script> tag
[04:45:03] <stenno> like this:
[04:45:04] <bhavesh> stenno: http://pastebin.com/FsrfdjeJ
[04:45:23] <amit_usual> alaing: i do use firebug but could not figure it out with it
[04:45:52] <amit_usual> alaing : may be a problem in using firebug any good tutorial you may know would be a great help
[04:45:53] <alaing> amit_usual: get firebug then you drill down into your page. you can also use console.log($('#myid')) if it returns jQuery() then it means it could not find your element
[04:46:16] <alaing> amit_usual: hold on there is a good tutorial
[04:47:08] <alaing> amit_usual: http://michaelsync.net/2007/09/30/firebug-tutorial-script-tab-javascript-debugging
[04:47:23] <bhavesh> stenno: that's the same code isnt it
[04:47:40] <alaing> amit_usual: and more about the other tabs http://michaelsync.net/category/firebug
[04:48:14] <diegoviola> quicksilver: it's a DOM object apparently, $(this).val() works
[04:48:14] <stenno> bhavesh, one second
[04:48:20] <bhavesh> ok
[04:48:52] <quicksilver> diegoviola: then, $(this)[0].id or this.id or $(this).attr('id')
[04:49:01] <diegoviola> quicksilver: thanks
[04:49:19] <stenno> bhavesh, http://pastebin.com/WhiU5XZF
[04:49:23] <diegoviola> alert($('#per_page').val())
[04:49:24] <stenno> this should work
[04:49:26] <diegoviola> that shows me the id also
[04:49:37] <hermanus> if i get it right, jQuery.param() is the equivalent of using serialize in php?
[04:49:45] <stenno> bhavesh, look at how i closed the first script tag and how i used $(document).ready
[04:50:38] <bhavesh> stenno: yes
[04:50:54] <stenno> bhavesh, does this work now?
[04:51:02] <stenno> i didn't test it myself
[04:51:07] <bhavesh> stenno: well one more problem.. My text keeps on moving and moving if I press my button for even 3-4 secs
[04:51:15] <bhavesh> it works :)
[04:51:27] <bhavesh> I want to move it just till user holds his key down
[04:52:33] <bhavesh> but jquery is quite accurate
[04:52:35] <stenno> bhavesh, bind 'mouseup'
[04:52:44] <stenno> oh wait
[04:52:48] <stenno> its just lag
[04:53:31] <bhavesh> like if I press my key for 5 secs text moves for 8 secs and if I hold it for 10 secs it moves for 14 secs
[04:53:50] <stenno> bhavesh, yes, it completes the animation before it starts another one
[04:54:04] <bhavesh> ok nvm
[04:54:04] <bhavesh> it works better than javascript..
[04:54:04] <stenno> maybe you could drop .animate and just change the css properties
[04:54:11] <bhavesh> ty steno
[04:54:12] <bhavesh> stenno*
[04:54:20] <stenno> np
[04:54:53] <bhavesh> ok
[04:55:05] <hermanus> if param() is the equivalent of php's serialize, how would i unserialize it? my goal is to serialize a jquery object, so i can save it, but serialize does not seem to work on objects, so i'm wondering if i should use param()
[04:55:14] <stenno> hermanus, JSON
[04:55:27] <hermanus> ah, off course, thanks stenno
[04:55:31] <stenno> :)
[04:55:52] <hermanus> man i was stuck
[04:56:04] <stenno> lol
[04:56:45] <hermanus> thanks again
[04:57:00] <stenno> np
[04:59:05] <imei> hey
[05:07:38] <MatthiasVance> So, I have constructed a variable that contains the result of $("<div></div>").load(url);
[05:07:41] <hermanus> so there's no toJSON in jquery? am i right?
[05:08:00] <MatthiasVance> It's an object. Now I would like to set the contents of td#a and td#b inside of there.
[05:08:06] <MatthiasVance> I have no idea how to approach this with jQuery.
[05:09:12] <hermanus> MatthiasVance, look at append(), prepend(), appendBefore() and prependBefore() or html() in the API
[05:09:45] <MatthiasVance> The first four are of no use, since I want to "select" an element inside the element I currently have.
[05:09:57] <MatthiasVance> The latter just returns html() as text, which is pretty useless for this.
[05:10:05] <MatthiasVance> :-(
[05:10:21] <lkeijser> i'm having trouble with reloading a page when a browser resize occurs, i've this snippet: http://dpaste.com/542953/  but it reloads immediately. Is there a way to wait until the 'resizing' stops, and _then_ reloads?
[05:11:28] <hermanus> ah, you mean you got a wrapper and want to select elements inside, im sorry i misread
[05:11:37] <MatthiasVance> Indeed! That's okay.
[05:11:44] <hermanus> .find() and .filter() might help
[05:12:00] <MatthiasVance> Ah, really useful, thanks!
[05:12:24] <hermanus> filter only filters, the wrapper stays te same. .find creates a new wrapper
[05:12:42] <stenno> hermanus, check this:
[05:12:44] <alaing> yes .find is what would be inside your element where as filter only filters the element
[05:12:51] <hermanus> so use end() with find if you want to keep the old wrapper
[05:13:01] <stenno> v8> JSON.stringify({x: 23}); //hope it works!
[05:13:18] <stenno> v8> temp = JSON.stringify({x: 23}); temp; //hope it works!
[05:13:24] <stenno> aww
[05:13:34] <MatthiasVance> If I had to write all this myself, it would have taken at least twice as long.
[05:13:36] <hermanus> thanks stenno, ill have a look at it
[05:14:05] <stenno> hermanus, should work with .stringify, not sure why v8 doesn't do anything
[05:14:08] <Fichte> hi guyz
[05:14:43] <Fichte> i use the sortable function of jquery ui   and want to get the attribute "ref" of the handled element
[05:15:04] <Fichte> but teh change event dont have the object of the using element
[05:15:12] <diegovio1a> i'm getting back the full html data from an ajax request, and i would like to take parts of that html data and replace/update the current content i have with the data i'm getting back, any pointers please?
[05:15:18] <Fichte> $(this) dont assign the rigth element
[05:15:28] <Fichte> any clues?
[05:15:40] <hermanus> Fichte,  check ui.item
[05:15:50] <Fichte> thx
[05:15:52] <Fichte> that amy work
[05:16:16] <jeroenem> hi i got a few lines of jquery for making an entire DIV clickable.. but it's opening in the same page... how to do this to open it in a new blank window?
[05:16:18] <jeroenem> http://jsfiddle.net/3M9DA/
[05:16:26] <jeroenem> i tried window.open but it failed
[05:17:03] <Lundy> heya guys, anyone know why when I click on a package it isnt creating the input? http://jsfiddle.net/GmVJN/
[05:17:25] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[05:17:52] <proycon> How do I clear callback functions? If I do  $('#blah').click(function(){ alert('1'); });    and later  $('#blah').click(function(){ alert('2'); });   they're both used.. I want the latter to override the former
[05:18:25] <Lundy> what i am trying to do is you click on a package and it creates a hidden input with the value of the number of times you clicked on the package ...
[05:18:31] <dabear> diegoviola: make sure it contains no js, and then do $(html).find(".foo").appendTo("body")
[05:19:02] <diegoviola> dabear: thanks
[05:19:10] <diegoviola> jquery rocks
[05:19:13] <diegoviola> :)
[05:19:17] <dabear> as does your mother
[05:19:36] <diegoviola> :)
[05:19:40] <Fichte> thx   its working
[05:19:47] <diegoviola> she is great indeed
[05:19:47] <hermanus> nice
[05:19:50] <diegoviola> br
[05:20:04] <dabear> diegoviola: yes, that's what I told her last night as well :)
[05:20:21] <lkeijser> i'm having trouble with reloading a page when a browser resize occurs, i've this snippet: http://dpaste.com/542953/  but it reloads immediately. Is there a way to wait until the 'resizing' stops, and _then_ reloads?
[05:20:29] <diegoviola> <.<
[05:21:22] <jeroenem> I got a few lines of jquery for making an entire DIV clickable.. but it's opening in the same page... how to do this to open it in a new blank window? http://jsfiddle.net/3M9DA/ i tried window.open but cant get it to work properly
[05:21:29] * diegoviola kicks dabear 
[05:21:30] <diegoviola> dabear: ;)
[05:21:48] <dabear> diegoviola: :)
[05:22:27] <Cork> ?.open @ jeroenem
[05:22:32] <Cork> ?window.open @ jeroenem
[05:22:43] <Cork> ah stupid bot
[05:22:59] <Cork> jeroenem: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.open
[05:24:28] <hermanus> stenno, JSON.stringify is native JS and not compatible with IE<8. but it's still the best shot?
[05:24:47] <stenno> screw IE<8
[05:24:57] <hermanus> stenno,  youre saying screw the customers
[05:25:04] <stenno> well
[05:25:38] <stenno> i don't think there is any other method then JSON.stringify
[05:25:45] <hermanus> and you're right, screw them
[05:25:46] <stenno> you could write one yourself though
[05:25:55] <sveri> is there an alternative to the autocomplete's mustmatch option? i cannot get it to work properly at my place :(
[05:25:57] <lambdaKalk> Hey guys, is someone familiar with changing the style of the data tables plugin? Everytime I change something it ignores my changes..
[05:27:41] <stenno> hermanus, if the customer wants pages that run in IE<8, you got 2 options: 1) optimize pages for IE<8, have a lot of pain in the ass, have a lot of drama, or 2) tell the customers: 'why don't you use any other browsers then IE? you could save a lot of money'
[05:28:07] <stenno> or IE9
[05:28:10] <hermanus> stenno, i think talking about money is a good suggestion, that always helps
[05:28:11] <jeroenem> Cork: thanks.. got it working now :)
[05:28:19] <stenno> hermanus, right! :)
[05:28:36] <Cork> stenno: normally the customer isn't the one that needs to update, so that argument seldom works
[05:29:13] <diegoviola> is there a way I could get only certain parts of HTML from an ajax request, like a block of HTML elements and not the entire document?
[05:29:34] <hermanus> diegoviola, you can treat it like XML and select elements
[05:29:48] <Cork> diegoviola: you will always have to grab everything the server sends you
[05:29:57] <dabear> diegoviola: didn't I tell you this a moment ago?
[05:29:57] <Cork> diegoviola: but you can filter it before you add it to the page
[05:30:04] <dabear> diegoviola: make sure it contains no js, and then do $(html).find(".foo").appendTo("body")
[05:30:06] <dabear> ^^
[05:30:29] <diegoviola> ok thanks, sorry about that
[05:30:33] <diegoviola> i'm learning
[05:32:06] <smartFun> HI! I have a problem with sending json object via jquery to servlet: jquery code:
[05:32:06] <smartFun> $.post("http://localhost:8080/RuntimeIM/BasicServlet", {"test" : "yeap"}, function(data) {});
[05:32:06] <smartFun> But on Servlet side I receive following string : test=yeap .
[05:32:07] <smartFun> jquery-1.5.2 tomcat 7.0.14 java 1.6
[05:32:47] <Cork> smartFun: jquery by default converts data to params
[05:32:50] <hermanus> smartFun, whats wrong with that string?
[05:33:14] <smartFun> on the server side I want to convert it to json again
[05:33:17] <Cork> smartFun: if you want to send json to the server you need to stringify the json, and send it as a param to the server
[05:33:34] <stenno> JSON in java ...?
[05:33:43] <smartFun> how can i stringify?
[05:33:49] <Cork> data: { json => JSON.stringify({}) }
[05:33:53] <Cork> opps
[05:33:55] <Cork> *json:
[05:34:36] <g0rd0n> is there a way to open a select box via jquery?
[05:34:47] <hermanus> smartFun, just BTW: if you need to stringify on IE<8 you can use the JSON.stringify function by Craig Buckler
[05:35:00] <smartFun> Thanks Cork!
[05:35:03] <Cork> g0rd0n: as far as i know, there isn't a way to open a selectbox from js at all
[05:35:32] <Cork> g0rd0n: if you want to do that, you need to fake the select box through js
[05:35:38] <g0rd0n> damn... cause i am loading stuff to the select box when clicking on it via ajax. works fine in firefox, but chrome and ie close the select box after retreiving the stuff
[05:35:40] <Cork> that is replace it
[05:38:41] <hermanus>  Cannot call method 'stringify' of undefined, ha, it cannot find the JSON object in chrome
[05:39:05] <stenno> hermanus,
[05:39:06] <stenno> JSON.stringify
[05:39:06] <stenno> function stringify() { [native code] }
[05:39:19] <stenno> thats with google chrome
[05:39:20] <hermanus> yup i call it like that
[05:40:02] <sean`> note that JSON.stringify isn't supported by all
[05:40:05] <hermanus> objJSON = JSON.stringify(formulierObjSchoon); i'll check my code, probably some strange thing going on
[05:40:13] <stenno> hermanus, thats 10.0.648.204
[05:40:23] <stenno> (my chrome build)
[05:40:44] <hermanus> i got 11.0.xx
[05:40:47] <stenno> maybe you do something like JSON = ... on accident
[05:40:49] <stenno> i see
[05:41:29] <manixrock> what's the normalized property for the scroll event that works in all browsers?
[05:41:51] <manixrock> http://api.jquery.com/scroll/ does not say. is there any, like e.pageX and e.pageY for mousemove?
[05:42:59] <stenno> manixrock, i think not even e.pageX and e.pageY works in every browser
[05:44:18] <hermanus> manixrock, scrollTop() has always worked for me
[05:44:31] <manixrock> stenno: "Fortunately, jQuery normalizes the .pageX and .pageY properties so that they can be used in all browsers. " from http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[05:44:59] <manixrock> hermanus: no, I want to intercept a wheel scroll then cancel it
[05:45:54] <manixrock> nvm found it, i had to watch the 'mousewheel' event
[05:46:23] <manixrock> hmm doesn't work in firefox 2
[05:47:44] <oDesk> here is my problem http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4dd0ca3f9c311
[05:52:15] <oDesk> anyone
[05:52:39] <orolo> i'm trying to get the "label" property from this JSONp : http://jsfiddle.net/orolo/DBE5n/18/
[05:53:03] <orolo> (type 'a' into the tags box)
[05:53:10] <ss1> test
[05:54:47] <orolo> the object comes back but something is not quite right w/ the way i'm navigating the JSON.
[05:54:50] <albacker> when i do something like $('select option:selected').val() does it return what is inside the <option ..> and </option> or the value of the attribute "value"?
[05:55:11] <orolo> albacker: .val() is a getter, .val('foo') would set it to foo.
[05:56:06] <albacker> let's say i have <option val="1">First</option>  what would $('option').val(); return ?
[05:56:16] <orolo> "1"
[05:56:34] <albacker> ok, in my case it's returning First,
[05:56:42] * albacker checks.
[05:57:01] <orolo> oh.
[05:57:03] <orolo> try .attr()
[05:57:04] <orolo> sorry.
[05:57:21] <orolo> value is the value of the checkbox, select, option etc.
[05:57:27] <orolo> attr() is probably what you're looking for.
[05:58:32] <albacker> ok thanks.
[05:58:34] <hermanus> removing the JSON.stringify script (IE fallback) repairs the JSON object and my script works wonderfully again.
[05:59:12] <hermanus> it was probably in the wrong scope
[05:59:44] <hermanus> stenno, so thanks, its working now
[05:59:58] <stenno> hermanus, no problem :)
[06:00:37] <Lundy> heya guys whats wrong with this?
[06:00:38] <Lundy> "package_"+ $(this).attr('name').length
[06:00:50] <Lundy> well
[06:01:00] <Lundy> alert("package_"+ $(this).attr('name').length); :( just returns the package name
[06:01:01] <Cork> depends on what you want
[06:01:21] <Lundy> I want the current value of a hidden input
[06:01:47] <hermanus> try $(this).val()
[06:01:51] <Cork> you want to have package_ + the number of characters in name?
[06:02:16] <Lundy> 2mins ill paste my code
[06:03:36] <Lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/GmVJN/2/
[06:03:41] <MatthiasVance> Apparently when specifying "cache: false" for ajax calls in jquery, it appends the current unix timestamp to the request.
[06:03:51] <MatthiasVance> Oh, perhaps I can just add the header myself.
[06:05:13] <Cork> Lundy: i'm still not sure what you intend to do with if ("package_" + $(this).attr('name').length) {
[06:06:06] <Cork> Lundy: is if ($("package_" + $(this).attr('name')).length) { what your looking for?
[06:06:14] <Lundy> Cork: when a staff member clicks [+] im wanting it to +1 into a hidden input for that package which is named "Package_$r['package_id']"
[06:06:53] <Cork> Lundy: and where do you get the id from?
[06:07:07] <Lundy> database
[06:07:20] <Cork> i mean where do you have it in code/page?
[06:07:47] <Lundy> yeah im pulling it from a MYSQL return in the code
[06:08:30] <oDesk> anyone for this ? http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4dd0ca3f9c311
[06:10:32] <Lundy> cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GmVJN/4/ has the PHP while init @ the bottom
[06:11:51] <Cork> Lundy: ok, now i see what your trying to do
[06:12:11] <Cork> Lundy: name is a reserved attribute, so you shouldn't use it on span
[06:12:22] <Cork> Lundy: use a data- prefixed attributes instead
[06:12:33] <Cork> thats waht they are meant for; ex data-package_id
[06:13:33] <Lundy> I could change span to div?
[06:14:12] <bittyx-laptop> i've been reading the docs for a long time and can't find what i need. if i use a selector and .attr, like $('#links > a').attr('tag-filter'), it only returns the 'tag-filter' attribute from the first element matched by the '#links > a' selector. how would i concatenate the 'tag-filter' attributes from *all* the matched elements, into a single string?
[06:14:29] <Cork> Lundy: you still shouldn't use the attribute name
[06:14:43] <Cork> Lundy: what element you use doesn't really matter
[06:14:52] <sean`> bittyx-laptop, map
[06:14:59] <Cork> Lundy: except form elements
[06:15:05] <Lundy> ok
[06:15:16] <sean`> var tagFilters = $('#links > a').map (function () { return this.getAttribute ('tag-filter'); });
[06:15:18] <Lundy> So how do you call it back in jquery?
[06:15:25] <sean`> var tagFilters = $('#links > a').map (function () { return this.getAttribute ('tag-filter'); }).get ().join (', ');
[06:15:34] <sean`> bittyx-laptop, ^
[06:15:37] <Cork> $(this).data('package_id')
[06:16:56] <bittyx-laptop> sean`: ahh, i get it. that's so simple, thanks.
[06:18:38] <oDesk> ok then the question is, how to load the <script> into the ().loaded page to effect current parent elements
[06:18:47] <sean`> getScript
[06:18:53] <walid> hi all!
[06:19:01] <oDesk> so the elements isn't into the loaded page but into the parent page
[06:19:13] <oDesk> sean`: will check that
[06:19:19] <walid> i'm pretty new to jquery, and i need a little help with smth. i can't find the proper syntax
[06:19:47] <walid> i have a div, from which i'd like to get the content, and hide all items that have this content as class
[06:20:48] <Lundy> okies thanks Cork
[06:20:49] <Cork> walid: i would recomend to save the class on the div instead of in its context
[06:20:53] <Cork> *content
[06:21:10] <Lundy> Cork: would I need to do data-package_id for my hidden input?
[06:21:12] <Cork> Lundy: was that all?
[06:21:20] <Cork> Lundy: no
[06:21:20] <walid> hm in the framework i'm using it's kind of complicated to do that...
[06:21:49] <walid> Cork: cause i don't really have access to the div's creation
[06:21:59] <hermanus> walid, $('#'+$('#div_with_class_as_content').val()).hide(); (if you're using id attributes)
[06:22:19] <Cork> walid: well then you would have to start by string grabing the content of the div, and parsing out what you want
[06:22:25] <Cork> walid: the rest should be farly simple
[06:22:38] <walid> Cork: the content is exactly what I need, actually
[06:22:58] <Cork> .textContent should get you the string then
[06:23:06] <Cork> or $().text()
[06:23:31] <walid> so basically i can use $(“#“ + anyVariable)) as a selector?
[06:23:41] <Aamir> wal
[06:23:46] <Aamir> walid:  yes
[06:24:00] <sean`> should have $.byID ('foo') or something
[06:24:03] <Lundy> Cork: dont want to be a pain but how do u set the current val +1 ?? like math,
[06:24:08] <sean`> I hate having to concatenate '#' + id
[06:24:17] <sean`> or an equivalent to sprintf :p
[06:24:20] <walid> Aamir: Cork thank you guzs
[06:24:27] <walid> i'll keep at it then
[06:24:39] <Aamir> sean`:  me 2
[06:25:15] <walid> :)
[06:25:34] <oDesk> sean`: in my case i'm loading php page how getScript play here ?
[06:26:01] <sean`> what do you men
[06:26:02] <sean`> mean
[06:26:04] <Aamir> oDesk: getScript is to get .js files :|
[06:26:07] <trevatwork> does anyone know of a good way to replace just a couple jQuery UI icons with color versions?  I'm thinking specifically of the edit pencil, the circle minus, and the circle plus.
[06:26:22] <sean`> trevatwork, photoshop
[06:26:32] <Aamir> trevatwork:  overwrite those css rules ?
[06:26:41] <Lundy> $("#package_"+$(this).data('package_id')).val($("#package_"+$(this).data('package_id')).val()+1); :( just keeps giving me 11111
[06:26:42] <sean`> or that
[06:26:46] <sean`> wtf
[06:26:58] <sean`> use parseInt  Lundy
[06:27:26] <trevatwork> Aamir, sean `: yeah I was hoping more that this was a problem someone had already solved w/ an existing icon set.  I can definitely do some bitmap surgery as a last resort
[06:27:39] <stenno> Lundy, .val() returns a string; and "1" + 1 is "11"
[06:27:48] <stenno> v8> "1" + 1
[06:27:54] <stenno> oh wait
[06:27:56] <stenno> wrong channel
[06:28:00] <Cork> lucasw: $("#package_"+$(this).data('package_id')).val(parseInt($("#package_"+$(this).data('package_id')).val())+1);
[06:28:09] <sean`> omzfgfgod
[06:28:11] <Cork> *Lundy ^
[06:28:56] <Altreus> When I paste, the paste event gets fired, but it is pretty useless because I can't find the pasted data, and it is fired before the DOM changes. Can I somehow fire an event to be received after the DOM changes; perhaps add it to a queue so that the DOM change of the paste happens, then my event?
[06:30:54] <Lundy> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/4E2Up/
[06:31:27] <Lundy> gives me "NaN"
[06:32:40] <Fox`> i'm using keypress to execute a function when enter is pressed on a textarea, but it's executing the function and then adding a line break. how would i block the default key action when being used as a hotkey?
[06:33:06] <skylamer> how to make shortkeys works only in certain situations and not in the all tpage ?????? :)
[06:33:22] <stenno> Fox`, preventDefault might be your friend
[06:33:24] <Cork> Lundy: http://jsfiddle.net/4E2Up/1/
[06:33:52] <Fox`> thanks
[06:33:55] <stenno> np
[06:34:32] <Fox`> yep. thanks
[06:35:18] <stenno> Fox`, 'yep' meaning 'it works like this' ? :)
[06:35:22] <walid> Cork: and if i want al but this to hide, can i use smth like $("#right :not(."+ tag+ ")").slideUp();
[06:35:27] <Fox`> yes
[06:35:44] <stenno> nice
[06:36:02] <Cork> walid: if tag is inside #right, ya
[06:36:16] <Fox`> i love building this project
[06:36:32] <walid> hm not working so far... i'll try some more and be back ;)
[06:39:43] <walid> Cork: hm i must be gettin smth wrong...
[06:39:44] <walid> $("#right :not(."+ tag+ ")").css('background-color', 'red');
[06:40:02] <walid> all my divs in right get red.
[06:41:50] <Aamir> sean`:  can i PM ?
[06:41:55] <sean`> yup
[06:42:39] <dr0id> sean`: can I PM ?
[06:42:49] <sean`> no
[06:43:08] <dr0id> :(
[06:43:42] <dr0id> why not ?
[06:43:55] <g0rd0n> because
[06:45:39] <Aamir> 1 PM at a time :)
[06:45:49] <imsky> what's up jquery wooo
[06:45:57] <imsky> 9 AM on a monday woooo

[06:51:56] <nyuszika7h> ?js jQuery.fn.jquery
[06:52:05] <nyuszika7h> ?eval jQuery.fn.jquery
[06:52:14] <nyuszika7h> Ah, bot gone again... :\
[06:53:37] <walid> hm.. the not selector isn't working as i expectedit...
[06:53:54] <hermanus> i love json, the inventor should get a statue
[06:54:19] <seutje> he already has
[06:54:47] <walid> $(".view-id-blog :not(.release)").css('background-color', 'red');
[06:54:49] <seutje> http://crockfordfacts.com
[06:54:49] <hermanus> ah, nice, where is it located? then i'll go there on pilgrimage
[06:55:04] <seutje> walid: possible that the space there is accidental?
[06:55:20] <walid> this should color in red whatever is in .views-id-blog, and isn't of class 'release', right?
[06:55:28] <seutje> ergo, u wanna match childred of .view-id-blog, or .view-id-blog itself?
[06:55:38] <mario-goulart> hermanus: the guy who probably inspired the json creator has a poster: http://www.xach.com/img/doing-it-wrong-at-a4.jpg
[06:55:38] <walid> seutje: btw blog and :not?
[06:55:43] <walid> no space required?
[06:56:00] <seutje> nah, if u want the children, u should add a * or use find()
[06:56:25] <hermanus> mario-goulart, :) i want that one
[06:56:26] <seutje> $('.view-id-blog').find(':not(.release)');
[06:56:43] <walid> seutje: thx
[06:57:20] <spir> hi. Anyone can help me with jQuery and Prototype conflicts? I have apply all http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries but it seems I still have conflicts : "element.dispatchEvent is not a function"
[06:57:30] <walid> seutje: in the API thez use it this way: input:not(:checked)
[06:57:35] <spir> error is here : http://meal-deals.london-discount-theatre.com/index.php?pg=79
[06:57:41] <walid> whz do i need to use find() ?
[06:58:12] <seutje> it's more readible than $('.view-id-blog *:not(.release)');
[06:58:17] <seutje> readable*?
[06:58:35] <walid> seutje: hm ok
[06:58:43] <walid> so i was missing the * in my syntax
[06:58:59] <spir> I try to load some code into a page that use Prototype. here is my code : http://pastebin.com/WbpnZduR
[06:59:10] <spir> here is the page where it bugs : http://meal-deals.london-discount-theatre.com/index.php?pg=79
[06:59:46] <walid> seutje: argh it's still not working!
[06:59:49] <walid> :(
[06:59:57] <seutje> got markup?
[07:00:13] <walid> hm
[07:00:19] <walid> drupal gives me my markup
[07:00:53] <walid> but basically i have a #right > .views-id-blog > .release / .event
[07:01:10] <walid> and i want on a click to hide/show either only release, or only event
[07:02:22] <oDesk> sean`: how i can check if link as attached  jQuery click event using Firebug ?
[07:02:31] <oDesk> sean`: has*
[07:02:51] <sean`> console.log ($('a').data ('events'));
[07:03:01] <seutje> walid: actually, it works fine without the asterisk http://jsbin.com/ekana4/edit
[07:03:10] <seutje> ?g visual event @ oDesk
[07:03:14] <seutje> right...
[07:03:19] <walid> seutje: but i'm thinking of assigning a new class to all ('blog-post'), and hiding all blog-posts, then showing the release divs
[07:03:29] <walid> but it's kinda dirty
[07:03:34] <seutje> oDesk: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[07:03:49] <seutje> walid: I suspect ur markup isn't what u think it is
[07:03:52] <walid> there must be a way, no? what could i be doing wrong? (ps: srz i have no live site...)
[07:04:26] <seutje> view source -> ctrl+a -> ctrl+c -> open pastebin or w/e -> paste -> submit -> copy url -> paste url
[07:04:33] <oDesk> seutje: sean` thank you
[07:04:49] <walid> lol seutje sure it's right there.
[07:05:15] <seutje> heh, nevermind I guess
[07:05:40] <walid> seutje: http://pastebin.com/n3TX6rrt
[07:05:52] <walid> sry it's pretty unreadible
[07:05:55] <walid> readable* ;)
[07:06:54] <seutje> I don't need to read it, my inspector can
[07:07:23] <walid> seutje: noob here, srz ;)
[07:07:32] <walid> line 527. there's the div i want to hide
[07:08:45] <seutje> walid: works fine here: http://jsbin.com/ekana4/2/edit>
[07:09:23] <seutje> that selector matches 71 elements
[07:09:55] <walid> ok 2 things.
[07:10:25] <walid> one i just understood.
[07:10:32] <johnhamelink> Hi there, is there a way I can set the config of the jQueryUI's datepicker without setting the picker its self? (for use within a PHP app)
[07:10:56] <walid> (i don't want to red all other divs, just the blog-post divs that aren't event as well)
[07:11:08] <walid> 2nd: how do i do this?
[07:12:16] <walid> i need smth like $("blog-type except (blog-type && event) ")
[07:12:46] <spir> hi. Anyone can help me with jQuery and Prototype conflicts? I have apply all http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries but it seems I still have conflicts : "element.dispatchEvent is not a function"
[07:12:51] <spir> I try to load some code into a page that use Prototype. here is my code : http://pastebin.com/WbpnZduR
[07:12:55] <spir> here is the page where it bugs : http://meal-deals.london-discount-theatre.com/index.php?pg=79
[07:13:04] <walid> thing is i need to be careful, cause i'm playing with a parent div, so i don't want/need tp hide all children divs.
[07:13:10] <quicksilver> walid: $(".blog-type:not(.event)") or similar.
[07:13:30] <walid> quicksilver: i tried this i think, but let me try again
[07:13:59] <walid> quicksilver: can both classes be at the same level?
[07:14:49] <quicksilver> walid: well, that matches all things with class "blog-type" which do not have class "event"
[07:14:52] <quicksilver> it does not care about levels.
[07:15:25] <spir> Anyone?
[07:15:25] <johnhamelink> Never mind, I found the answer to my question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3822365/jquery-datepicker-defaults
[07:15:40] <walid> quicksilver: thanks, it's working!
[07:15:40] <walid> :)
[07:15:48] <seutje> yeh $('.blog-type:not(.event)') should match all elements with class blog-type and without class event
[07:16:32] <Chad_C> do any of you have experience with passing Windows Authentication data to a WCF service?
[07:19:58] <hermanus> i got a json string and it's saved in a hidden textarea. somehow chrome is still treating some html data (inside the json string) as if they are dom-objects. Is there an easy way to stop this behaviour?
[07:20:24] <hermanus> i want it to be treated as a string, no matter whats inside that string
[07:20:47] <quicksilver> write valid HTML!
[07:21:08] <quicksilver> probably you need to escape it (< becomes &lt; > becomes &gt;)
[07:21:26] <hermanus> ahh thats is, offcourse, thanks quicksilver
[07:21:33] <wathek> I need some help please I'm trying to close a fancybox from its content but it doesn't work. I've created a function triggerClose() in the parent item (the page that shows the fancybox) and I call that function from the content of the fancybox by doing parent.triggerClose(); how ever it says : $.fancybox is undefined
[07:21:50] <wathek> here's my page http://extranet.draconismedia.com/clients/rayek2/
[07:23:44] <jmvelasco> hello, i have problems with modalbox on IE8, details here: http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/javascript-15/jmvelasco-modalbox-appear-down-page-instead-centered-ie8-757841.html
[07:23:56] <jmvelasco> anyone could give me a hand ? thanks in advance
[07:27:17] <Lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/PDZ9C/ is there a way of writing into that for when you enter the clients DOB if they are over the age of 40 then unhide a div ?
[07:28:23] <aram535> Hi, I'm trying to "hide" a drop down is finished getting populated via a getJSON->$.each ... is there a ready trigger that goes off when the drop down manipulation is being displayed by a browser?
[07:30:09] <aram535> Lundy: sounds like it's just math, no?
[07:32:19] <Jon47> aram I don't think there's an event for that.. you get "change", "focus", "blur", and all the mouse click events.. but that's probably about it
[07:33:45] <albacker> does $(form_name+' input').click(function(){..}); work?
[07:34:05] <albacker> i mean the form_name+... can i concatenate and have valid js/jquery ?
[07:34:31] <Jon47> albacker if the resulting string is a valid css selector, then yes
[07:34:48] <albacker> Jon47, ok thanks
[07:36:12] <ioneyed> Trying to use the example from jquery api on multiple-selectors but cannot seem to get it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/eKEAA/
[07:37:05] <tman> if i have an array of objects and i'm trying to target one of them based on the .index() of another array of objects how would i do that?
[07:37:26] <aram535> Jon47: I was seeing if $(document).ready or some other function gets set
[07:37:41] <tman> i thought to store the first set in a variable and then do something like arrayName[$(this).index()] but that returns a null object.
[07:38:33] <Jon47> aram535, why not just put a callback on the code that populates the list?
[07:39:25] <aram535> Jon47: strange enough I have a callback and it's getting triggered fine, but the browser is delayed for some reason.   HIDES....1...2...UNHIDES....3....4....5... Browser shows the data
[07:39:34] <aram535> UNHIDE is in the callback
[07:39:38] <tman> ah inArray is what i want.
[07:40:02] <hermanus> can anyone tell me how i can unescape a string, that's escaped with the JS escape() function, with PHP? stripslashes does not work, because it's escaped in a different manner
[07:40:11] <Jon47> aram535 it'll probably be difficult but.. if you make a fiddle  for the code we can fix it for you ;)
[07:41:09] <Jon47> hermanus, check out http://php.net/manual/en/function.rawurldecode.php
[07:41:22] <hermanus> Jon47, thanks
[07:41:35] <albacker> i want to do something like  $('form input[name=sport]').click(function() { launch(THE NAME OF THE PARENT FORM); }); ? how do i get the name of the parent form.. how do i get the parent object?
[07:41:55] <Jon47> I'm risking my neck here for you!  showing that I use a gauche language like php
[07:42:18] <aram535> http://jsfiddle.net/ZeGTw/
[07:42:20] <ioneyed> albacker: I believe in your .click you can do $(this).parent('form') to do what you need.
[07:42:36] <albacker> thanks
[07:42:47] <Benjamin__> hermanus: rawurlencode/rawurldecode
[07:42:48] <hermanus> Jon47, thanks that was exactly what i needed, it works. hehe nothing wrong with php if you ask me.
[07:43:10] <Jon47> aram535, can you add the markup and other stuff we need to make that example work?
[07:43:16] <hermanus> thanks Benjamin__ that works
[07:43:19] <Benjamin__> i'm definately too tired
[07:43:29] <Benjamin__> sorry Jon47
[07:43:43] <Jon47> lol, np np
[07:43:49] <aram535> Jon47: haha .. the file is like 5mb of code :-) let me see what I can do
[07:47:28] <Aamir> aram535:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/ZeGTw/1/
[07:47:34] <shomon> hi, I'm trying to add a datepicker to a form... but where can I download date_pt-pt.js?
[07:47:44] <shomon> Or do I have to get it inside of some other file?
[07:47:55] <shomon> it has to output dates in portuguese you see
[07:48:20] <aram535> Aamir: really? you think just moving the timeout inside of the call back is what the problem is??!?
[07:48:57] <Aamir> aram535:  you dont need timeout in callback function. its just to show u the msg
[07:49:25] <ioneyed> Trying to use the example from jquery api on multiple-selectors but cannot seem to get it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/eKEAA/
[07:52:14] <Solly> Anyone know of a good lightbox that acts as a inescapable input window, it's for a login etc
[07:53:04] <aram535> Aamir: That was it .... just had to move the code inside of the callback.   Which doesn't any sense to me, the timeout function must have been not seqential
[07:53:11] <aram535> sequential even
[07:53:58] <Aamir> aram535:  you need to understand the purpose of callback function in ajax. you cannot rely on setTimeout(fu...) the ajax request might be failed
[07:54:09] <albacker> if i have two inputs with id="match" and something like $('#match').keydown(function() { alert("A"); }); should i excepct an alert if i write on both input fields or will only the first one be affected?
[07:54:33] <Aamir> ioneyed:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/eKEAA/1/
[07:54:36] <aram535> Aamir: understood, I'll read up more on it.  thank you very much
[07:55:05] <AdvoWork> i tell you what, jquery dpes my head in, some things work with some versions, implement a new version and loose functionality, christ its annoying!
[07:56:44] <ioneyed> Aamir: yeah, after staring at it for an hour i stopped looking at it. took a glance and noticed the ' in the id filter.
[07:58:43] <MatthiasVance> AdvoWork: What functionality are you talking about? :)
[07:59:00] <MatthiasVance> Solly: I'm using the Dialog instead.
[07:59:10] <MatthiasVance> Solly: And remove the close button myself (I really think it should have an option for that)
[08:01:59] <Whirl3d> Good Morning All.
[08:02:24] <MatthiasVance> Good morning!
[08:02:59] <Whirl3d> Anybody have any suggestions for a good visual CSS manipulation app for Windows? I would like an app that verfied my css and pointed out potential problems/duplicates, etc. Is that asking too much?
[08:03:46] <MatthiasVance> You mean like any web development IDE?
[08:03:47] <Whirl3d> Good Morning MatthiasVance
[08:03:52] <MatthiasVance> *a
[08:04:28] <spir> hi
[08:04:32] <Whirl3d> I am using DreamWeaver (*gasp*) at the moment and I've tried Expression Web, but I thought maybe there was something better out there.
[08:04:44] <Whirl3d> spir, hi
[08:04:55] <spir> anyone can help with jQuery and Prototype ?
[08:05:00] <MatthiasVance> Whirl3d: I'm currently using PhpStorm.
[08:05:12] <Whirl3d> <--not familar with Prototype here, sorry.
[08:05:19] <spir> me either
[08:05:22] <MatthiasVance> Whirl3d: I have been using Dreamweaver for a long time, until it started to corrupt files by uploading old copies (when I had edited the site from another location).
[08:05:36] <spir> but i'm adding some jQuery to a page that already use prototype
[08:05:45] <spir> I've read that : http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[08:05:48] <hermanus> Whirl3d, have you tried skybound's stylizer? I myself like Geany, but stylizer is great if you like visual apps
[08:05:49] <spir> I apply it
[08:06:02] <spir> I must do something wrong : http://meal-deals.london-discount-theatre.com/index.php?pg=79
[08:06:15] <spir> here is my uncompressed code: http://pastebin.com/WbpnZduR
[08:06:17] <Whirl3d> MatthiasVance, me too! I have lost so much work that way and just figured it out recently. Now I am using NuSphere, but I'll check it out.
[08:06:29] <albacker> how $('form #match').keydown(..) is much more different than $('#match').keydown(..)
[08:06:33] <Whirl3d> hermanus, thanks, I'll check it out too
[08:06:53] <albacker> the 1st one applies the keydown function to all the #match inputs in the page, and the second only to the 1st one that is found.
[08:07:09] <albacker> is this the normal behaviour of jQuery?
[08:07:13] <scar2> what versions of IE is jquery NOT compatable?
[08:08:08] <Whirl3d> scar2, it's compatible with all versions of IE, though to varying degrees, it tries to be consistent across all browsers
[08:08:23] <MatthiasVance> Whirl3d: Is NuSphere good with JS/HTML as well?
[08:08:45] <oDesk> how to execute function upon complete ().load() action ?
[08:08:47] <quicksilver> albacker: yes, that's correct. Of course there shouldn't be more than one element with the same ID and your page won't work well on all browsers
[08:08:54] <MatthiasVance> Hm, it lacks Mercurial integration.
[08:09:09] <albacker> quicksilver, you're right. thank you.
[08:09:10] <Whirl3d> allbacker, you should only ever have one #match on a page. ID's are used for single elements, not multiples
[08:09:18] <Solly> MatthiasVance: thanks mate, i'll take a look at it, i'm also looking to give that lightbox effect, as in have an opaque grey background too
[08:09:20] <albacker> quicksilver, what would happen if i was talking about a class?
[08:09:38] <albacker> quicksilver, would $('.classHere') and $('form .classHere') be the same?
[08:09:39] <scar2> http://infugia.com/test.html#
[08:09:43] <scar2> why doesnt that wokr? i copied it from the demo
[08:09:44] <MatthiasVance> Solly: Dialog kind of supports that with the option "modal: true".
[08:09:52] <MatthiasVance> Solly: I'm sure you can edit the effect it creates.
[08:10:06] <quicksilver> albacker: no.
[08:10:08] <spir> So no one could help me with that conflicts bug I have?
[08:10:17] <quicksilver> albacker: the second one is all things with class 'classHere' inside a form.
[08:10:24] <Whirl3d> spir, that's a mighty big request.
[08:10:33] <Solly> MathiasVance: thanks again i'll go try it out. :)
[08:10:42] <albacker> quicksilver, well assuming that i'm using classHere only in inputs that are inside forms..
[08:10:44] <spir> Whirl3d>What do you mean?
[08:10:56] <quicksilver> albacker: then there is no difference for that case, no.
[08:10:57] <albacker> it wont get the 1st one only, neither of those.. right?
[08:11:20] <Solly> one other thing off topic, how do you make highlighted text? it's in red, is that a whisper (first day back on irc in 8+ years)
[08:11:30] <Whirl3d> spir you are asking someone to jump into your project and handle it for you...I, for one, don't have the time to figure out Protoype to help. And I would bet that most people in here are too busy to look into an entire project for you
[08:11:31] <albacker> thanks
[08:11:56] <Whirl3d> spir, if you have a specific problem/question, post it along with a jsfiddle and someone might be more inclined to help
[08:12:16] <Solly> <Solly> hi
[08:13:04] <spir> Whirl3d>I posted some pastebin code. I think it's pretty simple bug. It's just a bug I have somewhere in my code that make the prototype lib disable.
[08:13:21] <spir> Whirl3d>I applied what they say there : http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[08:13:36] <spir> http://pastebin.com/WbpnZduR check line 92
[08:15:19] <toastyghost> does anybody know why jcarousel would be squishing images when it computes its size based on the size of the images you give it?
[08:16:37] <scar2> can i do an onClick="$('.target').hide();" ?
[08:18:06] <muley> ?click @ scar2
[08:18:26] <muley> scar2: try .click() http://api.jquery.com/click/
[08:18:58] <BBonifield> Whirl3d: you should try to move line all of your jQuery.noConflict() calls to your init_jquery function.  if i understand you right, the problem is that your prototype code isn't working properly.  That's because jQuery has redeclared the $ variable, so you need to reset it back to Prototype's $ right after jQuery is loaded.
[08:19:12] <_foobar> Is there any way I can clear all css from a element easy?
[08:19:32] <oDesk> i'm going to be crazy
[08:19:45] <scar2> http://pastebin.com/fGtUj9Gw -- whats wrong with this?
[08:19:51] <scar2> i cant get the class to hide
[08:19:53] <oDesk> i can execute function using firebug
[08:19:54] <Whirl3d> spir, I think that BBonifield was talking to you actually.
[08:20:05] <scar2> oops wrong pastebin
[08:20:09] <oDesk> after each .load()  request
[08:20:17] <scar2> http://pastebin.com/8jCWXik5
[08:20:17] <BBonifield> _foobar: clear the css?  i mean, if it's inline style you can just remove the style attribute.  if it's inherited styles, you'd need to have some reset class that you can apply to the element.
[08:20:26] <BBonifield> spir: yes sorry, check above ^^
[08:20:29] <Whirl3d> BBonified, thanks, I was going to say something similar, buy you said it much more eloquently.
[08:20:42] <Whirl3d> *BBonifield, sorry
[08:20:50] <oDesk> then everything is ok... but that i's manual .. how i can execute the function upon completion of .load() method ?
[08:20:50] <skamikaze> ?ready @scar2
[08:20:55] <_foobar> BBonifield: ty.. it was inline..
[08:20:59] <scar2> skamikaze yes
[08:21:03] <skamikaze> scar2: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:21:08] * skamikaze misses bot-t
[08:21:08] <bencc> can I put a json string as a value in a request params?
[08:21:14] <Whirl3d> Looks like Bot-T is on vacation
[08:21:23] <spir> BBonifield>Yeay!
[08:21:28] <spir> BBonifield>Thanks I'll try that
[08:21:49] <skamikaze> bot-t is lost in vegas -_-
[08:21:51] <scar2> hm
[08:21:58] <oDesk> http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4dd0ca3f9c311
[08:22:12] <muley> scar2: http://pastebin.com/SHYCEBGj
[08:22:34] <spir> BBonifield> right after the line : if (typeof jQuery != 'undefined') { right?
[08:22:36] <Solly> anyone tried to put an iFrame into a jquery modal dialog box?
[08:22:45] <muley> actually,,, you have your selectors backwards. the 'clickme' should be for .click() and the a.toggleLink should be for .hide()
[08:22:48] <oDesk> now that ajaxComplete doesn't executed after the .load()  how to do it ??
[08:23:08] <BBonifield> spir: yeap, that should do it
[08:23:16] <ch3mical> word
[08:23:58] <Whirl3d> Yo Yo! ch3mical is in da house!
[08:24:07] <scar2> muley: ok i got it to work, now what i wanna do is turn this into a function that will hide all the class, but will then show an ID-- is there a way to attribute a variable thru the class?
[08:24:14] <ch3mical> lol
[08:24:17] <ch3mical> sup Whirl3d
[08:24:28] <spir> BBonifield> Doesn't seems to work : element.dispatchEvent is not a function
[08:24:30] <Whirl3d> same ole same ole, you?
[08:24:43] <ch3mical> It's Monday T_T
[08:25:01] <spir> BBonifield> If I don't call $() in my jQuery code plus I add the noConflict function that should work
[08:25:17] <Whirl3d> <--every day is the same for me-no regular schedule
[08:25:26] <ch3mical> Nice
[08:25:27] <albacker> is this valid 	var matchId = $('#les_match:last option:selected').attr("value");  (except the fact that i'm not supposed to have more than one element that corresponds to the same id) ?
[08:25:33] <spir> BBonifield> But even if I do that I still get that error.
[08:25:34] <albacker> (the :last part...?)
[08:26:07] <Whirl3d> makes it hard to remember what day it is. Add to that the fact that I sleep about every 2 or 3 days for a couple of hours and time just flies by
[08:26:16] <Whirl3d> flys by
[08:26:17] <spir> BBonifield>Let's try within my waitForJQuery function
[08:26:21] <Whirl3d> ?
[08:27:06] <muley> scar2: yeah you ca do something like function toggle(){ $(".hideThese").hide(); $("#myid").show(); }
[08:27:18] <ch3mical> "Flies by" I think
[08:27:24] <shomon> hi, I'm trying to get date picker to work. I'm getting "$("#month").datePicker is not a function" but the main jquery, date.js, the date extensions for my locale and the little bit of initialisation code seems to match the right id...
[08:27:55] <BBonifield> spir: did you remove all of the jQuery.noConflict() calls and add just one call in the init_jquery function?
[08:28:03] <markj> datepicker shomon not datePicker
[08:28:15] <shomon> sorry I mean the main jquery, date.js and date-pt-PT.js all work...
[08:28:16] <BBonifield> spir: the error you're getting is most definitely because of the two libraries not playing together properly
[08:28:29] <shomon> aah I see... thanks markj
[08:29:18] <shomon> markj,  now I'm getting the same error... how do I check if the library loaded?
[08:29:29] <shomon> Error: $("#month").datepicker is not a function
[08:30:28] <markj> shomon if you could paste your code in jsfiddle.net im sure someone will take a look
[08:30:29] <spir> BBonifield>I know. I have google that and digg into it a lot. I know ot's because $ of prototype has been erased by jQuery. http://pastebin.com/aF6cEcuh
[08:30:50] <spir> BBonifield>Maybe this happen because jQuery has been loaded after prototype
[08:31:16] <BBonifield> spir: that's actually exactly what jQuery.noConflict() is for - when jQuery is loaded after prototype
[08:31:19] <spir> BBonifield>Maybe I should hack the jQuery code directly from the source so when it load it's already conflict-less
[08:31:28] <spir> BBonifield>Ok
[08:32:18] <spir> My jQuery code works well. But the prototype is down.
[08:33:08] <spir> Maybe I should right that code in prototype
[08:33:48] <shomon> ok thanks markj - will keep looking through tutorials...
[08:34:21] <spir> BBonifield>I'll try to debug more by adding my code line by line (almost) and see where it crash the code.
[08:38:04] <BBonifield> spir: fwiw, it seems to work just fine for me.  http://jsfiddle.net/BBonifield/m3zRL/2/ including prototype 1.7 directly and then loading jquery after the fact with your code

[08:41:34] <spir> BBonifield> Still got the same error
[08:43:39] <BBonifield> spir: it seems to me that your error is that cooljs menu is trying to use prototype before it is loaded

[08:48:27] <CaveJohnson> Ok let me phrase that differently.

[09:00:28] <Frederic23> Hi, in regexp is there match any as long as it's not group

[09:01:04] <Frederic23> I've tried [^(?:<l>)] but that doesnt work
[09:01:28] <bhavesh> Is there any way to disable Up and Down Page scrolling?
[09:02:07] <bhavesh> I found some scripts but they even disable other features like I cannot type in any textbox
[09:05:15] <cirwin> bhavesh: your users will not like you if you do that :p
[09:05:46] <bhavesh> cirwin: I will do it only when user clicks on a <div> which has stuff which they will move with arrow keys
[09:06:18] <cirwin> bhavesh: in that case, returning false from the event handler which moves stuff in the div should prevent the scrolling
[09:06:21] <Vaerros> not very usable or accessible
[09:06:46] <tomasm-> is there inline editing in jquery? is there something part of the core library or as plugins?
[09:07:04] <Vaerros> if you have some widget that replicates some vanilla functionality it should, I say, compliment it instead of replace it
[09:07:15] <bhavesh> cirwin: erm it would also disable moving stuff inside it too?
[09:07:16] <cirwin> tomasm-: I imagine there's a plugin
[09:07:27] <cirwin> bhavesh: no, you return false after you've moved the stuff :p
[09:07:42] <bhavesh> cirwin: i see..
[09:08:18] <jamesdean77> Morning
[09:08:49] <jamesdean77> How do you find a srting in a object using jQuery ?
[09:09:00] <cirwin> jamesdean77: what do you mean?
[09:09:34] <bhavesh> cirwin: alright it worked! one more question, I use .animate to move my stuff inside <div> with arrow keys so when I keep my arrow key pressed for 5 secs, the div keeps moving for 12 secs
[09:09:49] <jamesdean77> @cirwin I have a json object and I want to find a sring in said object
[09:09:56] <tomasm-> does anyone recommend an in-place editing plugin? there seems to be a few
[09:09:58] <bhavesh> cirwin: and if I press it pressed for 10 secs it moves for like 20 - 22 secs
[09:10:22] <bhavesh> so is there any way to stop it moving instantly after I leave my key? cirwin
[09:10:24] <cirwin> jamesdean77: if you have an object like {"foo":"bar"} you can do object.foo, or object["foo"] to get bar
[09:10:54] <cirwin> bhavesh: I'm sure there is, but I don't know what it is — perhaps you can interrupt animations on keyup?
[09:11:42] <bhavesh> cirwin: I want to move it in all directions... up down left right.. even if I press opposite key it keeps on moving...
[09:12:28] <cirwin> bhavesh: Have you tried something like $("div").keyup(function () { $(this).stop() });?
[09:13:02] <bhavesh> cirwin: nope, ill try that (im hyper new to jQuery btw)
[09:13:29] <bhavesh> cirwin: what do u mean by "this" in $(this).stop(
[09:13:43] <cirwin> bhavesh: I'm just guessing
[09:13:44] <bhavesh> cirwin: and why only keyup?
[09:14:06] <cirwin> bhavesh: that will tell you when the user has stopped pressing an arrow key
[09:14:26] <bhavesh> cirwin: oh so its opposite of keydown!
[09:14:32] <cirwin> right :)
[09:16:44] <CaveJohnson> why in the world is my $('form#foo > input:text#fieldName').val() returning undefined?
[09:17:10] <markj> what does $('form#foo > input:text#fieldName').length return
[09:17:19] <quicksilver> because names don't come after #, ids do
[09:17:28] <quicksilver> perhaps you wanted input[name=fieldName] ?
[09:18:26] <CaveJohnson> well "fieldName" is both the name and the id of the input I'm looking for
[09:18:57] <CaveJohnson> does it matter if that id is not unique to the document, but *is* unique within that form?
[09:19:01] <quicksilver> yes
[09:19:09] <quicksilver> if your ID is not unique to your document then your computer will catch fire
[09:19:15] <quicksilver> and your cat will die.
[09:19:30] <bhavesh> cirwin: I dont think its working
[09:19:31] <quicksilver> IDs must be unique - that is what they are.
[09:19:40] <CaveJohnson> It is broken.  Make it go.
[09:19:46] <quicksilver> :)
[09:20:07] <CaveJohnson> hmm... this is going to take some thought then
[09:20:34] <CaveJohnson> actually... [name= might be the short answer then
[09:20:38] <shomon> I'm trying to get jquery working (am not very used to using javascript) -  I have an internal site that can't be accessed from the net... Where can I paste?
[09:20:50] <markj> jsfiddle.net
[09:21:06] <shomon> thanks
[09:21:17] <bhavesh> http://jsfiddle.net/PtaFn/
[09:21:21] <bhavesh> is it right?
[09:21:33] <bhavesh> I cant stop animation when I keyup
[09:21:40] <bhavesh> it moves for a longer time
[09:24:03] <quicksilver> bhavesh: .stop stops the current animation. If you've held down the key for a while you have many animations queued. Only one will be stopped.
[09:24:31] <quicksilver> bhavesh: try stop(true), as explained in the docs http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[09:24:37] <shomon> how do you get jsfiddle to give you a url?
[09:24:47] <bhavesh> shomon: save
[09:25:00] <shomon> http://jsfiddle.net/eaFdF/ ah thanks
[09:25:19] <bhavesh> quicksilver: ok, but have I placed   $("#bv_Text1").keyup(function () { $(this).stop() }); at correct place?
[09:25:24] <shomon> ok so I really don't know if I've put it all in right there, but I'm trying to just get the date picker thing to appear
[09:25:40] <ccmonster> hey guys, having trouble with this recursive piece. It was working but not sure what's happening. http://pastie.org/1911302
[09:25:51] <shomon> I'm able to run other jquery things (click.hide) but not the date picker... how can I tell if it has loaded?
[09:25:53] <CaveJohnson> quicksilver: will the non-unique id still bork the selection if I'm only selecting 'form#foo > input[name="fieldName"]'?
[09:25:58] <halcyon1234> jQuery UI Accordion: Is there a way to say "even when collapsed, be the width of the longest item"?
[09:26:38] <ch3mical> halcyon1234: Just have a container div set to that width
[09:26:40] <_axx> Hi everybody :) I wonder, whats the typical way to load a function on DOM ready, $(function(){ alert('w00t'); }); or the standard way with $(document).ready(function(){ alert('w00t'); }); ? :)
[09:26:47] <quicksilver> bhavesh: I suspect not, because you're getting keydown on the body element and only trying to intercept keyup on the <div>. I'm not sure how that will work to be honest.
[09:27:17] <quicksilver> CaveJohnson: as long as the ID #foo is unique, I think it should be OK, although it might be browser-dependent. Non-unique IDs are invalid HTML after all.
[09:27:33] <oDesk> people, what's wrong with this  http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4dd0fe495cf3c
[09:27:52] <oDesk> i want the callback to work after the .load() completed
[09:28:00] <halcyon1234> ch3mical: Except the items are fluid, so I won't know what the length of the longest item is.
[09:28:06] <CaveJohnson> quicksilver: well I'm aware of that, but I'm not sure how to set the name and the id to different values with zend
[09:28:09] <shomon> http://jsfiddle.net/eaFdF/1/ anyone know why the date picker isn't appearing? I'm trying in 2 different ways, in the code.
[09:28:19] <ch3mical> _axx: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
[09:28:42] <oDesk> even i tried load(url, {}, function(){})  and still nothing, but if i took the call back function and i fire it from firebug then it works perfectly ?
[09:29:09] <_axx> ch3mical: thank you :)
[09:29:22] <ch3mical> halcyon1234: you would have to determine it in some way in order to make that dimension static, no matter how you intend to do it
[09:30:03] <halcyon1234> ch3mical: Ok, I can do it manually. I was hoping there'd be a "DoAsHalcyonSays = true" switch or something. =)
[09:30:04] <bhavesh> quicksilver, cirwin: It works now, have a look http://jsfiddle.net/PtaFn/2/ thank you :)
[09:30:30] <ccmonster> It was working but not sure what's happening when im recursively gonig through my xml. It's breaking and not sure how/why. http://pastie.org/1911302
[09:32:39] <bhavesh> adding return false; in my jquery function which maks my page stop scrolling also does not allow me to enter or edit values in textfields
[09:32:55] <bhavesh> is there any other way to stop scrolling a page......?
[09:32:59] <bhavesh> with arrow keys
[09:33:10] <imsky> um yes
[09:33:20] <bhavesh> imsky: and that is?
[09:33:21] <ch3mical> halcyon1234: Not that I'm aware of. Maybe you should add that to the codebase for them ;)
[09:33:26] <imsky> bhavesh: trolololol
[09:33:43] <bhavesh> imsky: ?
[09:34:50] <walid> what's the difference btw $().click and $().bind(click()) ?
[09:35:59] <brianseeders> you here Whirl3d?
[09:36:34] <imsky> wooo total blackout
[09:37:16] <brianseeders> walid: $().click() and $().bind('click', ...) are the same thing
[09:37:22] <brianseeders> .click() is just a shortcut
[09:37:36] <walid> so why use bind?
[09:37:39] <walid> any special reason?
[09:38:12] <brianseeders> you could use it if you were binding handlers dynamically
[09:38:18] <brianseeders> var event = 'click'
[09:38:27] <brianseeders> bind(event, function() {});
[09:38:54] <walid> hmm i guess i need a little more insight to get it..
[09:38:58] <walid> brianseeders: but thanks :)
[09:39:03] <brianseeders> bind is the core function, and click is just a shortcut to it
[09:40:02] <brianseeders> and .click() without an argument is the same as .trigger('click')
[09:41:05] <walid> brianseeders: thx i got it now i think

[09:53:11] <stenno> is there still ff 3.5 in the debian stable apt package...?
[09:53:21] <juha___> i'm at school, learning how to use dreamweaver (actually coding own stuff)
[09:53:29] <ccmonster> anyone able to help me recursively handle this json
[09:53:30] <ccmonster> ?
[09:53:46] <juha___> old browser without devtools and/or possibility to upgrade/install anything, awesome
[09:54:02] <jeffsmykil> how do i return the text of the <li>?  http://jsfiddle.net/c9ndZ/6/
[09:54:05] <juha___> i need moar braaaain
[09:54:14] <koopa58> BRAAAINS :)
[09:54:29] <jeffsmykil> [i].text doesnt work
[09:54:47] <jeffsmykil> or i.text()
[09:55:07] <koopa58> jeffsmykil: .get(i).text() ?
[09:56:35] <koopa58> Hi everyone, I'm looking for a way to append to a configuration of easySlider. I need to have a default config and then some specific config for each slider. Is this possible?
[09:56:56] <juha___> is tinymce too 2008 or is there a better option around
[09:57:11] <imsky> what is "too 2008"
[09:57:18] <jeffsmykil> koopa58: no comprende
[09:57:36] <juha___> imsky: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/tryit/full.php atleast the layout
[09:58:00] <imsky> hmm if you say so
[09:58:12] <Abjorn> brodingo: hey you ever been to one of those austin js meetings? I'm thinking about going tomorrow night :o
[09:58:31] <imsky> lol what else do you have to do
[09:58:35] <imsky> build a rocket ship?
[09:58:45] <juha___> imsky: one good thing about tinymce is that it's always been highly customizable
[09:58:46] <Brodingo> yeah i follow austin js but ive never been
[09:59:04] <Abjorn> they're giving out a ticket to TXJS tomorrow so I'm interested :D
[09:59:12] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[10:00:10] <koopa58> jeffsmykil: Could you post your script online?
[10:01:08] <dukebag> hey trying to figure out why this piece of code is not working... using jQuery.sub() ... http://pastie.org/1911488
[10:01:29] <Abjorn> brodingo: you should go with me tomorrow :D not that I would recognize you there or anything rofl
[10:01:39] <dukebag> i'm getting some bogus "cjQuery cannot call replace" error
[10:01:54] <Brodingo> well i dont have any plans
[10:02:17] <Abjorn> although I hate going downtown
[10:02:25] <Brodingo> haha i was about to say that
[10:02:46] <Abjorn> on 6th street, no less. guess im gonna have to park somewhere else and walk lol
[10:02:58] <dukebag> so when jQuery is calling stuff like jQuery.fn.css, does it need the "this" object to be a jQuery object?
[10:03:51] <Brodingo> dukebag yes, the css method is on the jquery object
[10:04:04] <Abjorn> Hm, they're going to a pub afterwards. Too bad I'm under 21 lol
[10:04:16] <Brodingo> oh haha
[10:04:20] <juha___> hahah
[10:04:25] <dukebag> so if you call jQuery.sub(), execute a query, how can you load the new query as the "this" object?
[10:04:26] <systemfault> Too bad you're in the US ;)
[10:04:33] <Abjorn> inorite?
[10:04:37] <dukebag> or, in this case of my code, if i'm doing it this way, newjQuery.fn.css2.apply(obj,arguments);
[10:04:39] <Abjorn> 21 legal drinking age? Such shit
[10:04:43] <juha___> i've never understood the 21 agelimit in the states
[10:04:52] <Abjorn> neither does anyone under the age of 21
[10:05:00] <dukebag> can i do jQuery.fn.css.apply(anyObject, arguments) ... ?
[10:05:09] <juha___> you can drive when you're 16, you can go to war at 18, lose arms and legs, but you can't drink until you're 21
[10:05:25] <koopa58> Hi everyone, I'm looking for a way to append to a configuration of easySlider. I need to have a default config {option: true} and then some specific config for each .easySlider({option: false, other: no}). Is this possible?
[10:05:42] <Brodingo> ?css
[10:05:42] <Abjorn> at least the drinking age isn't 16, the same as the driving age. That could be disastrous
[10:05:51] <Brodingo> godamnit bot-t where are you
[10:05:59] <Abjorn> he disappeared :(
[10:06:21] <sokie_de> ?css()
[10:06:23] <imsky> yes he is gone
[10:06:24] * imsky wiggles
[10:06:26] <juha___> Abjorn: i see no problem with that, as here in filand all the stuff is 18, driving license, drinking and military service
[10:06:28] * Abjorn wiggles
[10:06:40] <dukebag> it seems to be less a problem with css specifically than figuring out how jQuery handles object handling
[10:06:43] <bhavesh> pos_x = event.offsetX?(event.offsetX):event.pageX-document.getElementById("pointer_div").offsetLeft;
[10:06:47] <Abjorn> juha__: yeah but you euro guys are apparently much more responsible than us americans
[10:06:50] <juha___> Abjorn: and most of us are still alive, drinking and driving really cleans up the genepool
[10:07:06] <bhavesh> this gives me coordinates of the point where I click with relation to pointer_div
[10:07:19] <bhavesh> where event is onclick
[10:07:48] <bhavesh> How can I get those coorinates again when I change my div with arrow keys .animate in jquery
[10:07:56] <Brodingo> dukebag im a little confused by your syntax, have you used jquery a lot?
[10:07:57] * sokie_de writes down that genpool thing..
[10:08:04] <imsky> sokie_de: lolol
[10:08:09] <sokie_de> :-D
[10:08:11] <dukebag> yea, i'm trying to hijack the CSS function
[10:08:14] <dukebag> that much is new for me
[10:08:19] <Brodingo> oh ok gotcha
[10:08:34] <Abjorn> imsky you should come to austin tomorrow for the austin js meetup
[10:08:42] <Brodingo> havent had any experience with sub myself
[10:08:42] <Abjorn> we can wiggle together
[10:08:43] <imsky> Abjorn: sure, i'll just hop on the next flight
[10:08:46] <bhavesh> where event = keydown
[10:08:49] <dukebag> i want any css changes on a particular object to apply equally to an object stored in the selections "data"
[10:09:15] <dukebag> i'm looking almost for like a symbolic "link" between 2 jquery selections, basically
[10:09:21] <dukebag> so any executed function applies to botht he same
[10:09:28] <Brodingo> hmmm
[10:10:01] <dukebag> it's proving to be a pain in the ass, but i'm convinced i can get some awesome value if i get this done
[10:10:46] <dukebag> the basic goal is to rip block-level elements as positioned elements... so whenever the block size changes or whatever, the absolutely positioned element changes too
[10:10:53] <admin_> http://pastebin.com/ni9gPGKM
[10:11:00] <dukebag> same goes for style changes
[10:11:25] <admin_> the source is a variable, why is jquery sending a get request with my variable as URL?
[10:11:40] <Brodingo> dukebag like masonry?
[10:11:41] <dukebag> it's tough because i can sorta pick out the gain made from doing it, but i'm also basically coding stuff that is not supported natively by HTML/CSS... and subsequently jQuery haha
[10:11:55] <dukebag> Brodingo: what.
[10:12:06] <imsky> Abjorn: how's monday treating ya
[10:12:10] <roryreiff> I have implemented Shadowbox.js on thumbnail links in google maps API infoWindow - but my gallery length is getting doubled. Would love to get to the bottom of this - www.pomona.edu/tour/47.aspx (click any spot, then the thumbnails to see example).
[10:12:24] <Brodingo> dukebag http://desandro.com/resources/jquery-masonry/
[10:12:39] <Abjorn> imsky: well I've been awake for like an hour so i dont know yet haha
[10:12:45] <imsky> good stuff
[10:13:05] <dukebag> no not quite
[10:13:13] <dukebag> but that's a good link, because it shows me others have thought this way too
[10:13:18] <dukebag> i'm more going for layering
[10:13:34] <dukebag> and then i want to readily duplicate elements so they can easily be given borders, trims, dropshadows, whatever
[10:13:34] <admin_> ajpiano,
[10:13:46] <dukebag> it should hopefully make any kind of effect or overlay easier too
[10:14:06] <dukebag> so if you wanted to flash or darken a photo with a slight tint, this code would make that super simple without complicating the HTML markup
[10:14:19] <Brodingo> dukebag check out isotope too http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[10:14:54] <Abjorn> desandro's stuff is awesome
[10:14:55] <Brodingo> creates layouts with positioning or alternatively translate if available
[10:14:55] <dukebag> haha, even if someone has coded exactly what i want, i gotta do this meself
[10:15:03] <dukebag> that's how one learns :)
[10:15:11] <Brodingo> oh i know, but yeah you should check it out
[10:15:44] <dukebag> yea this stuff is good
[10:15:46] <dukebag> again, it confirms that i'm thinking along the right lines
[10:16:02] <indstry> does anyone know of a plugin or example of how to parse a form  and return a JSON object?  I have a form that fields are added dynamically,  the data is also nested,  so for example Event[1][title]='Test Event',  Event[1][times[1][value]="12:00",Event[1][times[2][value]="14:00" etc.  I would like to return it as JSON with nested arrays/objects
[10:16:11] <dukebag> ok, so back to this BS
[10:16:17] <dukebag> http://pastie.org/1911488 !!! :)
[10:16:39] <dukebag> actually, here: http://pastie.org/1911563
[10:16:44] <dukebag> that's the entire context
[10:17:19] <ajpiano> admin_: is dset a .. url?
[10:17:23] <dukebag> so if the selection has a data object called 'layered-el', then it should apply the CSS to that el as well
[10:18:44] <dukebag> here's a question that may help me, when jQuery starts throwing this bogus errors like "cannot find replace function" or whatever, it seems to indicate that jQuery is "falling through" pieces of code
[10:18:50] <dukebag> similar to when you omit a 'break' in a switch case
[10:19:13] <dukebag> so is that thinking correct, and when jQuery starts doing stuff like that, running more iterations/loops/calls than it seems like it should, is there a commonc ause?
[10:19:31] <ch3mical> indstry: use .serializeArray() and then JSON.stringify(theArray)
[10:19:47] <ch3mical> http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[10:20:01] <dukebag> and also, what specifically is the benefit or difference when you are calling jQuery.fn.* vs. jQuery(selection).*
[10:21:06] <k1t> http://rlv.zcache.com/jquery_is_tshirt-p235940145631537902ywmd_400.jpg
[10:21:09] <k1t> [;
[10:21:14] <ajpiano> dukebag, usually when something like that happens, you're passing something of the wrong type along as an argument
[10:21:29] <dukebag> ok that makes a lot of sense, actually
[10:21:31] <ajpiano> like you are supposed to have passed a string, but you didn't
[10:21:37] <ajpiano> so it can't find the replace method of the not-string
[10:21:44] <dukebag> yea yea, i've been doing that a lot lol... trying to extract objects but not doing so properly
[10:21:50] <pred|dog> hi
[10:21:56] <dukebag> having to call the $(selection).toArray()[0]
[10:22:14] <Abjorn> best shirt ever, k1t
[10:22:16] <ajpiano> huh
[10:22:26] <ajpiano> dukebag, what's wrong with $("selector")[0]
[10:22:32] <ajpiano> if you want the first item as a dom element?
[10:22:34] <dukebag> that sounds like a better solution :)
[10:22:37] <dukebag> yup[
[10:22:58] <dukebag> so why the heck doesn't this work: jQuery.fn.css2.apply(obj,arguments); ???
[10:23:12] <dukebag> maybe obj is not the right kind of object
[10:23:18] <dukebag> is it expecting a jQuery object?
[10:23:28] <ajpiano> ostensibly, yes
[10:23:32] <Abjorn> why are you using apply on the css2 function?
[10:23:48] <dukebag> http://pastie.org/1911563
[10:24:44] <alexparker> hello everyone
[10:25:01] <dukebag> so what i noticed is that the this keyword changes as soon as i enter into a new function scope
[10:25:16] <dukebag> it becomes the DOMWindow or whatever...
[10:25:19] <ajpiano> yes, it does
[10:25:32] <ajpiano> you can force the scope of that IIFE though to be the 'this' of the function
[10:25:46] <dukebag> IIFE, sec googling that haha
[10:25:48] <ajpiano> (function() {}).call(this);
[10:25:50] <ajpiano> IIFE == SEAR
[10:25:53] <ajpiano> SEAF*
[10:25:54] <ajpiano> ?iife
[10:25:56] <predat0r> guys if I have uncounted num. of options in a plugin, how to do the following : if (num1).val() ==0 && (num2).val() == 0 .. and so on ?
[10:26:00] <ajpiano> wow botty isn't back yet
[10:26:04] <dukebag> that's incredible, international index of erectile function
[10:26:12] <dukebag> SEAF????
[10:26:16] <dukebag> yea, no google results :P
[10:26:24] <ajpiano> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[10:26:30] <dukebag> Ok i see
[10:27:26] <phed__> I am going to send some dates from the server to a javascript page in json-format. What is the best way to represent it?
[10:27:54] <phed__> Ie. I want to format the date on the page, and I'd also like to specify an exact date in order to facilitate paging
[10:28:33] <phed__> *Datetime actually
[10:28:43] <alexparker> how do you manually constrain ui draggable space
[10:28:50] <ajpiano> phed__i would recommend just passing a unix timestamp
[10:28:58] <dtach> Hi everyone i made a test script here > http://jsfiddle.net/AZAPh/ i was hoping to get some feedback, can this be done better? im no expert on jQuery but i just want this to be as cross-browser and foolproof as possible
[10:28:59] <ajpiano> and then converting that into a date object when you receive the json
[10:29:11] <alexparker> returning false on the drag: functio(e,ui){ ..return false.. } cuts the dragging all together
[10:30:43] <alexparker> ie: drag: function(e,ui) { if(ui.position.left >0){ return false } },  so they can drag left fine, drag back to the right fine, until it hits 0, then dragging stops  and you have to MouseUp then mousedown again to start dragging again
[10:30:51] <dukebag> :D :D :D :D
[10:31:11] <dukebag> i had to call the IIEF with the proper arguments i was using inside it lol
[10:31:35] <phed__> ajpiano: hmmm, I am reading that isoformat RfC 3339 is the best one. I am using python, and it seems simplejson supports this natively
[10:32:43] <phed__> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/455580/json-datetime-between-python-and-javascript
[10:33:57] <DarsVaeda> hi, I have "<div id="foo"><input ...><input ...></div>", I can select the div with "object.parent()" and then can get the id "foo" of that with object.parent().attr('id') - but how do I select all inputs?
[10:34:20] <Anitox> $('#foo input')
[10:34:25] <CasperTheGhost> http://jsfiddle.net/vxJHN/ : anyone know how I can submit the AlertName which comes up in the prompt after clicking Submit? it doesnt show up after the form is submitted...
[10:35:01] <phed__> but yeah, it seems ctime is the way to go
[10:35:50] <workmad3> phed__: heh, I read that as 'crime is the way to go' and was wondering what criminal career you were going to go for :)
[10:36:23] <DarsVaeda> Anitox: thx, but when i do for i in $('#foo input') and alert(i.attr('name')), it only says that attr is not a function, so i guess that wasn't selected right, not?
[10:37:00] <Anitox> $('#foo input').each(function(){ alert(this.name); });
[10:38:56] <CasperTheGhost> :/ anyone?
[10:39:45] <DarsVaeda> Anitox: hmm, that works, thanks! just when I think I finally got jquery, I see I still don't ;)
[10:40:21] <Anitox> heheh
[10:42:57] <CasperTheGhost> anyone able to help me
[10:43:39] <phed__> workmad3: that's how coding feels sometimes. always the compromise between Right and Works ;)
[10:44:54] <CasperTheGhost> http://jsfiddle.net/vxJHN/ : anyone know how I can submit the AlertName which comes up in the prompt after clicking Submit? it doesnt show up after the form is submitted...
[10:46:37] <CasperTheGhost> I know how to check for it just not sure how to tell it to include it into my form after you click send
[10:48:31] <Whirl3d> I know this is a jquery channel, but I have come to rely on and trust the advice of folks in here, so....can someone advise me on how to master CSS--80% of my jquery problems are CSS related..uggh
[10:48:54] <Anitox> inheritance
[10:49:01] <Anitox> use proper ids and classes
[10:49:17] <yuvipanda> is it possible to dynamically change the an <input> element from type="radio" to type="checkbox"?
[10:49:25] <Anitox> dont spam your html with excessive classes and styles
[10:49:27] <yuvipanda> a .attr("type", "checkbox") doesn't seem to work
[10:49:43] <Whirl3d> Anitox, thanks for the common sense reminder. I really need to learn when you can animate a div, when you can't. When you can center something when you can't. It seems to random right now
[10:49:45] <Anitox> yuvipanda, you may want to remove it and add it again
[10:49:55] <yuvipanda> Anitox, was hoping to avoid that.
[10:50:01] <yuvipanda> sigh
[10:50:02] <yuvipanda> okay
[10:50:23] <djQuery> yuvipanda: .replace
[10:50:31] <Whirl3d> Anitox, did you take a class in CSS or read a book or ????
[10:50:56] <Anitox> i have a little CSS book
[10:51:01] <yuvipanda> djQuery, ah, thanks
[10:51:09] <Anitox> but i mostly use the web for info
[10:51:19] <Anitox> and i do lots of little testing ;)
[10:51:24] <djQuery> Whirl3d: google is your friend
[10:51:42] <Whirl3d> djQuery, have you ever used Google? My friend has ADD
[10:51:45] <Whirl3d> lol
[10:52:52] <ch3mical> lol
[10:53:19] <CasperTheGhost> http://jsfiddle.net/vxJHN/ : anyone know how I can submit the AlertName which comes up in the prompt after clicking Submit? it doesnt show up after the form is submitted...
[10:54:49] <Whirl3d> If you have ever asked a friend with ADD how to do something, you know that it is often better to just figure it out yourself. That's where the real value of an IRC channel like this comes in. I'm not asking for search results, but rather actual experience--which Google can't provide.
[10:54:55] <ch3mical> Has anyone ever used Ingrid for tables?
[10:55:19] <Whirl3d> <-never used Ingrid
[10:55:26] <ch3mical> I'm not clear whether it relies on a php script server-side or if that's just an option
[10:55:36] <djQuery> Whirl3d: I have ADD as well whats ur point
[10:56:47] <CasperTheGhost> :( okies... no1 wants to help me
[10:57:23] <ekkis> if I do $("<img />")[0].outerHTML I get <img>, not <img/>
[10:57:31] <ekkis> this is bad, how come?
[10:57:56] <djQuery> CasperTheGhost: your $("button:submit").click(function() { is never firing for me
[10:58:09] <djQuery> ?.prompt
[10:58:11] <ekkis> it means that if I do $("<img />").after("xx") I get <img>xx instead of <img/>xx
[10:58:24] <ekkis> which means xx doesn't show up.  gets swallowed by the image
[10:58:43] <djQuery> ?.after
[10:58:44] <DarsVaeda> when using $.get() with the data option, while data is generated with .serialize() from a jquery object, how do I append data to this?
[10:58:55] <djQuery> ?botsnack
[10:59:03] <djQuery> stupid bots dead
[10:59:20] <Whirl3d> djQuery, My point is that Google does not provide opinions or experience. I'm not asking for a gazillion results that I have to spend the next month sorting through just to find out how to make a floated div behave the way I want. I'm asking people who have experience, what is the best way to learn it. I have read books, I think I'm really proficient in CSS and yet I am still baffled by the
[10:59:20] <Whirl3d> results I get sometimes.
[10:59:36] <Krinkle> ?eq @ Krinkle

[11:00:49] <dtach> Hi everyone i made a test script here > http://jsfiddle.net/AZAPh/ i was hoping to get some feedback, can this be done better? im no expert on jQuery but i just want this to be as cross-browser and foolproof as possible
[11:01:04] <dtach> its a working demo
[11:01:44] <ekkis> anyone see my simple question? weird...
[11:02:58] <CasperTheGhost> djQuery: what u think?
[11:03:15] <Ismogoan> who sees whats wrong? ==> http://pastebin.com/YXgvA0Y8
[11:03:56] <ekkis> Ismogoan: it's not compiling? or?
[11:04:32] <Ismogoan> normally it should append something
[11:04:35] <Ismogoan> but nothing happens
[11:04:50] <Ismogoan> it did like 2 mins ago
[11:04:55] <Ismogoan> some typo or something
[11:04:58] <Ismogoan> getting codeblind
[11:05:01] <ekkis> looking...
[11:06:19] <djQuery> CasperTheGhost: did you look at example 9 of the improptue docs/
[11:06:22] <ekkis> Ismogoan: it looks all right.  try stepping through it
[11:06:45] <djQuery> third parameter for the callback is going to have a key value of the fields used in the prompt.
[11:08:22] <CasperTheGhost> djQuery: yes but how do I send f.alertName to test.php with the rest of the data submitted
[11:09:08] <djQuery> CasperTheGhost: you could try something fancy like putting a hidden input on the form then setting the inputs value before submitin it?
[11:10:32] <djQuery> CasperTheGhost: if you wanted to get fancy you could serializeArray add the new item to the array then do an ajax submit.
[11:13:06] <CasperTheGhost> going to try the first 1 ;) just need it to work thats all
[11:14:59] <Ismogoan> what is the easiest way to format a new Date(millis) to lets say dd/MM/yyyy
[11:15:00] <Ismogoan> ?
[11:15:45] <ekkis> ugh
[11:15:53] <ekkis> it's always hard.  I have code somewhere
[11:16:00] <ekkis> but it'll be easier if you google
[11:16:10] <fris> Ismogoan i use a date library http://www.datejs.com/
[11:16:37] <maxmoore14> Ismogoan: try this...
[11:16:39] <maxmoore14> function (dt) { return (dt.getMonth() + 1) + '/' + dt.getDate() + '/' + dt.getFullYear(); }
[11:16:44] <ekkis> can anyone tell me why $("<img/>") produces <img> but $("<p/>") produces <p></p>???  that's nuts!
[11:17:31] <djQuery> CasperTheGhost: and your remove code sucks.   $('.remvoe').live('click', function(e){$(this).closest('tr').remove();});
[11:17:35] <maxmoore14> or you could extend the Date object with that function and call it simply as new Date().toCustomDateString()
[11:18:14] <Ismogoan> ty maxmoore14 :)
[11:18:17] <predat0r> so i have the following little code: http://pastebin.com/w3ktf6EW    - now if i delete input fields top->down submit will disablet after clearing last input field
[11:18:20] <djQuery> ekkis: because 1 is supposed to allways have closing </> and one doesnt
[11:18:21] <maxmoore14> no prob
[11:19:04] <maxmoore14> anyone familiar with the ui dialog?
[11:19:05] <ekkis> djQuery: 1) it's invalid xhtml, 2, an open tag swallows stuff
[11:19:07] <predat0r> i want to modify that if i clear one of the fields the submit gets disabled
[11:19:59] <predat0r> any suggestion?
[11:20:02] <ekkis> djQuery: so if I do: $("<img />").after("shite"), I get the image but no shite (cuz it got swalllowed)
[11:22:13] <djQuery> ekkis: $('.shite').after($('<img />'));
[11:22:42] * ekkis tries
[11:23:33] <predat0r> djQuery any hint for my question?
[11:24:32] <ekkis> djQuery: would this be wrong then? $("shite").after($("<img />"))[0].outerHTML
[11:24:33] <djQuery> ekkis: but seeing as how $('<img />') is not in the dom yet is .after on it valid? $('<img />', {src: 'myurl.jpg', title: 'someimage'}).appendTo('.whatever').after('.shite');
[11:24:46] <ekkis> I would expect <img/>shite
[11:25:38] <ekkis> I don't think .after() requires the element to be in the DOM.  after all, it's a simple concatenation, no?
[11:25:52] <djQuery> ekkis: dont think thats right
[11:26:36] <ekkis> djQuery: what I want to end up with is <img/>shite
[11:27:00] <ekkis> I can't believe this is so complicated
[11:27:03] <djQuery> ekkis: dont know man
[11:27:19] <djQuery> put it where you want it then append to it
[11:27:36] <djQuery> have you looked at .add
[11:27:42] <queuetip> i'm looking for a way to debug this thing - there's a crap-ton of js, among other things (php), and i have a dialog box that has a form on it that i'm trying to disable pressing enter but to no avail, on the text box itself (there's only 1) i have already onkeydown and onkeyup to capture event.keyCode==13 to return false but still it's not working for me, does anyone have any suggestions on how to debug what's actually happening when i press enter on it?
[11:27:48] <ekkis> I put the newly created jquery element into a variable and then I append to it
[11:27:54] <djQuery> predat0r: can you slap together a fiddle of it
[11:27:55] <ekkis> but append adds a child to it
[11:28:03] <ekkis> .add()? looking it up...
[11:28:32] <predat0r> fiddle handles plugins?
[11:28:50] <predat0r> or brake down the code
[11:31:06] <djQuery> queuetip: $(document).keypress(function(e){  if(which == 13){return false;}})
[11:31:10] <xsamurai> Trying to do the following example http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/default.html , yet locally im getting a similar response http://jsfiddle.net/mW82M/
[11:32:27] <bittyx-laptop> hey all, i have a bit of a problem. i have some links on my page (regular <a> ones), which control some other stuff (which items on the page are shown etc.). each link is supposed to have an on/off value, and act as a toggle, with the "on" color being #fff, and the "off" color #999. the :hover should be something like #99f. when i load the page, all the links are in the "on" state by default, and the :hover color works when i move my mouse over
[11:32:28] <bittyx-laptop>  them. when clicked, they do what is needed, and change color with .animate({color:'#999'},300); and that's all okay. however, the problem is, after the first time .animate() is called on a link, the :hover color stops displaying. how do i fix this?
[11:32:48] <ekkis> djQuery: so, $("<p/>").append("shite")[0].outerHTML creates: "<p>shite</p>" but $("<p/>").add("shite")[0].outerHTML: "<p></p>"
[11:32:53] <djQuery> xsamurai: is it because you are not including the style sheet for jquery ui?
[11:33:02] <predat0r> djQuery here you are : http://jsfiddle.net/L4ta4/
[11:33:30] <xsamurai> djQuery: checking
[11:33:35] <bittyx-laptop> hey all, i have a bit of a problem. i have some links on my page (regular <a> ones), which control some other stuff (which items on the page are shown etc.). each link is supposed to have an on/off value, and act as a toggle, with the "on" color being #fff, and the "off" color #999. the :hover should be something like #99f. when i load the page, all the links are in the "on" state by default, and the :hover color works when i move my mouse over

[11:33:37] <bittyx-laptop> ouch, sorry
[11:34:00] <Cork[home]> djQuery: add adds it to the jquery array, that means <p></p>shite, and that doens't have an outerhtml
[11:34:11] <bittyx-laptop> accidentally reposted :S anyway, what i was typing is, the :hover is defined for the link (a) in .css (i suppose this is important somehow)
[11:34:30] * predat0r what a traffic jam today :>
[11:35:43] <ekkis> Cork: but the object returned by $("<p/>").add("shite") is an array that contains a single element [0].  that single element must thus contain "shite" somewhere
[11:36:10] <djQuery> predat0r: why bother splitting the array? why not just do $(o.inputFields).each(function(){  test for validity here?  })
[11:36:22] <Cork[home]> ekkis: no it doesn't as shite isn't an element, and can't be anywhere
[11:36:43] <reco> any jquery lazyload image jquery recommendation?
[11:36:57] <Cork[home]> akk: you have to append the test inside an element, it can't be the outer most element
[11:36:58] <reco> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload seems to be oudated
[11:37:04] <Cork[home]> *ekkis
[11:37:14] <predat0r> djQuery: because how to check each input field that changed ?
[11:37:23] <bittyx-laptop> to put it simple - after calling .animate() on an <a> element, the element's :hover css definition stops working (because, i assume, .animate() puts it's own inline style into the html, which takes precedence over the css). the question is, how do i keep the color targeted by .animate({color:'#999'}); _and_ keep my css defined :hover style?
[11:37:24] <ekkis> Cork: ok, so my problem is that $("<img />") generates "<img>" instead of "<img/>".  I need to end up with "<img/>shite"
[11:38:05] <Cork[home]> ekkis: your appending it to another element?
[11:38:53] <ekkis> yes, to an <li>, somewhere down the road but for now I just want to create a variable with all the stuff I need so later I can do myVar.html(s)
[11:38:59] <ekkis> where s is my stuff
[11:39:02] <predat0r> djQuery: check again the jsfiddle i pasted the orig code what i want ti pluginize
[11:39:13] <Cork[home]> ekkis: you have to keep it as html then
[11:39:29] <predat0r> djQuery: bottom of js scripts
[11:39:35] <ekkis> I think I see what you're saying...
[11:39:39] <Cork[home]> ekkis: or create a wrapper span or something for you test
[11:39:46] <Cork[home]> *text
[11:40:05] <ekkis> yeah.  I think I get it
[11:40:09] <ekkis> thanks
[11:40:13] <Cork[home]> ekkis: the problem comes town to what a jquery object is, its an array of dom elements
[11:40:30] <Cork[home]> town==down
[11:41:23] <ekkis> Cork[home]: yeah
[11:43:49] <djQuery> u have to supply a new link predat0r
[11:44:11] <predat0r> http://jsfiddle.net/L4ta4/2/
[11:44:17] <predat0r> soory
[11:45:54] <predat0r> djQuery: it's about the order how it applies to the fields, i think. FIFO thing
[11:48:34] <tbranyen> atula: you're in boston?
[11:48:44] <atula> tbranyen: yep
[11:48:47] <tbranyen> oh sweet
[11:48:51] <atula> tbranyen: wai? wuttup?
[11:49:01] <atula> who's this!!?? are you a stalker ?
[11:49:04] <tbranyen> you just joined the node.js meetup group i started friday
[11:49:09] <xsamurai> beh even after adding the css it still doesnt work
[11:49:11] <atula> I thought so as much :P
[11:49:15] <tbranyen> heh
[11:49:22] <xsamurai> should i use something else like lightbox, thickbox instead
[11:49:31] <atula> that's why I changed name to autalpha which is my other alias
[11:49:44] <atula> atula is too ... shall I say... javascript oriented :P
[11:53:00] <predat0r> djQuery: i have to realize an AND between the fields, to work perfectly as I want..
[11:53:37] <jeffsmykil> is my syntax incorrect?
[11:53:38] <jeffsmykil>  $("#massSubscriptionPanel").animate({width: "show"}).delay(4000);
[11:55:02] <jeffsmykil> the delay isn't happening
[11:55:02] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: yes. first of all, look up .animate() and you'll see that delay is merely the 2nd function arg, not another function. secondly, what is width: "show"? i've never seen that before..
[11:55:19] <jeffsmykil> necromancer: it works quite well
[11:55:22] <necromancer> you want .animate({css: "stuff"}, 4000)
[11:55:25] <necromancer> what does it do?
[11:55:31] <ajpiano> necromancer, width:"show" is perfectly valid
[11:55:56] <dtach> Hi, can anyone tell me if the way i coded this is good enough or if you have any ideas on how to improve it or should be done, http://jsfiddle.net/AZAPh/
[11:56:04] <jeffsmykil> i thought the second function was speed not delay
[11:56:33] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: your animation also needs a time parameter
[11:56:37] <dukebag> hey, ok, so i want to link multiple elements together so they all trigger mouseout,mouseover in a linked way
[11:56:44] <dukebag> so they don't have to be nested in the hierarchy or related at all
[11:56:47] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: you could just wrap the animate call in a setTimeout..
[11:56:50] <dukebag> any plugins for this or do i need to create one?
[11:57:25] <ajpiano> dukebag, since it's completely unclear what you'r describing, you'll probably have to make it yourself
[11:57:28] <necromancer> haha
[11:57:41] <jeffsmykil> i think complete will work ajpiano
[11:57:42] <necromancer> dukebag: there's probably nothing general enough to be a plugin and specific enough for what you're trying to do
[11:57:44] <dukebag> :D
[11:58:01] <xsamurai> which *box plugin is recommended to work with jquery ?
[11:58:04] <dukebag> yea, generalizing HTML sucks
[11:58:06] <ajpiano> colorbox
[11:58:13] <dukebag> i'm gonna punch HTML in the face
[11:58:34] <bittyx-laptop> i have some trouble with jqueryui's .switchClass function. i use it like $(this).switchClass('oldClass', 'newClass', 300), and it changes the class in exactly 300ms, at once, with no gradual change between the old and the new style. how would i accomplish this? ie. make a transition between the two classes?
[11:58:49] <xsamurai> ajpiano: colorbox's page seems to be down i'll see if i can get it elsewhere
[11:59:09] <bittyx-laptop> is there something else i need to do to get it working?
[11:59:30] <necromancer> dukebag: haha what?
[11:59:38] <necromancer> what's your problem with HTML?
[11:59:56] <necromancer> xsamurai: any facebox plugin that's written for jquery? i personally like facebox
[12:00:02] <necromancer> err any *box plugin*
[12:01:49] <xsamurai> i just worry about using a plugin that will have no support 6 months down the line
[12:02:28] <predat0r> djQuery : i solved it, thanks
[12:03:48] <nylinuxhelp> hi all, having some trouble with the datepicker plugin in IE. (8/9). No errors are thrown in the console, and only the 'ring' around the datepicker shows up (works fine in Firefox and Chrome on Windows 7).
[12:12:33] <timrombergjakobs> Hello. Anyone got any experience from creating an dynamic counter in jquery
[12:12:34] <Whirl3d> why does chrome give you the SOP error when testing locally? the files have the same domain (local file system).?
[12:12:36] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: can you take a look at this?  the second animation isnt firing
[12:12:37] <jeffsmykil> http://pastie.org/private/d7mi4jhy2znoovg3von4iq
[12:12:48] <jared__> quick question: I have some elements structured as  .bulletpoints > li > .bulletpoint_tooltip . When I apply hover() to .bulletpoints, how would I select .bulletpoint_tooltip? I can't figure out how to grab the nested child
[12:13:23] <Whirl3d> jared__>  try .children() or .find()
[12:13:34] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: why are you animating it with 0 duration
[12:13:44] <jared__> I tried $(this).children('.bulletpoint_tooltip') and $(this).children('li .bulletpoint_tooltip')
[12:13:45] <jeffsmykil> it didnt work with 400
[12:14:04] <jared__> find worked, but it didn't do it within $(this), it grabbed all instances
[12:14:05] <predat0r> jared__ live() ?
[12:14:12] <timrombergjakobs> I'm trying to fetch a json resultset retirned from a database and increment the counter with the data
[12:15:02] <jared__> predat0r, how would that work?
[12:15:05] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: didnt work with 400
[12:15:17] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: the first one works, second one just doesnt fire
[12:15:28] <predat0r> jared__ are them generated runtime?
[12:15:35] <jared__> no
[12:15:39] <jared__> they are already there
[12:15:41] <predat0r> ok so srry
[12:15:48] <Whirl3d> jared__ how are you selecting a single bullet point?
[12:15:51] <predat0r> i guess tooltip..
[12:16:22] <jared__> basically, when I do a hover() over the parent .bulletpoints, I want to select child li > .bulletpoint_tooltip
[12:16:38] <jared__> lemme paste my code in jifiidle one sec
[12:17:08] <jeffsmykil> i dont think hes selecting hes showing right?
[12:17:12] <jeffsmykil> is it an english thing?
[12:17:14] <jared__> http://jsfiddle.net/pxmeB/
[12:17:23] <jared__> that is just paste of the code, no actual html elements
[12:17:24] <Whirl3d> inside your hover handlers, you use the scope for the parent li element. So $(this).find ('.bulletpoint_tooltip') will only find the one belonging to it
[12:17:29] <jared__> see waht I am trying to do?
[12:17:38] <jared__> ok let me try that
[12:17:51] <jeffsmykil> jared you want them to fade in
[12:17:55] <jeffsmykil> just use fadeIn
[12:17:58] <jeffsmykil> and fadeOut
[12:18:13] <timrombergjakobs> so did anyone have any feedback on that??
[12:18:16] <jared__> jeffsmykil, that may be better, but I still need to get it selected
[12:18:27] <timrombergjakobs> If anyone done the same please let me know
[12:18:30] <Whirl3d> jared___ add the html, please
[12:18:50] <ekkis> guys, how do I display unicode in a textbox?
[12:19:19] <jared__> Whirl3d, one moment
[12:19:23] <jared__> thanks for your help
[12:19:43] <Whirl3d> jared__, this is easier than you think, btw.
[12:20:12] <jared__> oh just found my problem
[12:20:14] <jared__> drrr
[12:20:17] <ccmonster> Hey guys, I am having trouble with this recursive json function - http://pastie.org/1911302
[12:20:21] <ccmonster> its not outputting the second levels
[12:21:01] <timrombergjakobs> Ill paste my function its not working correctly now but maybe someone has any feedback http://pastie.org/1912222
[12:21:08] <jeffsmykil> Whirl3d: can i get in line behind jared?
[12:21:21] <tooter> ahhh - the mere log onto irc just made me work out the answer to my query :) thanks folks :P
[12:21:40] <ekkis> ccmonkey: you might try this.process()
[12:21:42] <dtach> Hi, can anyone tell me if the way i coded this is good enough or if you have any ideas on how to improve it or should be done, http://jsfiddle.net/AZAPh/
[12:21:51] <ekkis> I'm not sure "navigation" would be available in that context
[12:22:03] <predat0r> ccmonster why dont you use a function and call it recursivly
[12:22:07] <Raylton> hi guys...
[12:22:10] <ccmonster> what do you mean?
[12:22:25] <ekkis> ccmonkey: line 30
[12:22:27] <jared__> Whirl3d, I was applying the hover to a wrapper, instead of one of the children. Dumb mistake, thanks for your help
[12:22:46] <ccmonster> whats off with 30?
[12:23:02] <ekkis> ccmonkey: have you tried debugging?  I'm guessing the "navigation" variable doesn't exist
[12:23:09] <ekkis> you should try this.process()
[12:23:18] <Raylton> someone have a complete exemple to use of jquery sortable with mysql?
[12:23:31] <ccmonster> it's all wrapped inside navigation.
[12:23:35] <predat0r> ccmonster putting the core in a function and call it again in itself. i made it in php not long time ago..
[12:23:46] <ccmonster> notice how it's being called in in the init()
[12:24:41] <ekkis> ccmonkey: var navigation = {} means you assign to a variable an object.  the variable may fall out of scope
[12:24:51] <Raylton> it is right place to this question ?
[12:24:56] <predat0r> do you know a good minifyer app?
[12:24:58] <ccmonster> so what are you saying is the way to correct it ?
[12:25:21] <ekkis> ccmonkey: use "this"
[12:25:24] <ccmonster> predat0r, YUI compressor i thought was pretty good
[12:25:29] <ccmonster> in this case, where am i using this.
[12:25:32] <predat0r> checkin'
[12:25:35] <ekkis> that refers to the object that contains the process method
[12:25:36] <ccmonster> because im using the [n][i]
[12:26:00] <Raylton> some one can help me please
[12:26:22] <ccmonster> can you help me ekkis ? not totally sure how to rewrite it in this case using $(this)
[12:26:24] <swiggy> $('input['name="contentitem"]').bind('checked', function(){ //do something when this checkboxes are checked });
[12:26:27] <swiggy> is that valid
[12:26:35] <swiggy> .bind('checked') ??
[12:26:40] <ccmonster> try it out in firebug swiggy
[12:26:46] <ekkis> ccmonkey: I get confused between "this" and "self"
[12:26:50] <ekkis> it's one of the two
[12:27:03] <ccmonster> self is used to help keep scope seperate
[12:27:08] <ccmonster> so you dont goof it up
[12:27:11] <ekkis> but if it were "this" then you would just do "this.process()"
[12:27:16] <ccmonster> so maybe you are referring to self
[12:27:25] <ccmonster> hmm...
[12:27:38] <ekkis> yes, whatever the keyword in javascript is that refers to the object you are
[12:27:50] <ekkis> I think it's "this"
[12:28:00] <ekkis> because that's why in jquery you do $(this)
[12:28:23] <ccmonster> but i need to tweak it to use $(this) everywhere..
[12:28:38] <timrombergjakobs> Im having problem with creating a counter in jquery. If anyone have anyone done the same please have a look. http://pastie.org/1912222
[12:28:42] <ch3mical> "$(this)" is not the same as "this"
[12:28:48] <ccmonster> I know
[12:29:31] <swiggy> says missing ) afer arguement list
[12:29:38] <swiggy> $('input['name="contentitem"]').bind('checked', function(){
[12:29:38] <swiggy>   $('#segmentinclude, #segmentexclude').show();
[12:29:38] <swiggy> });
[12:29:48] <swiggy> i dont see where it is missing a )...
[12:29:49] <ccmonster> still can't get to the second level
[12:29:49] <unomi> Hi, the 'click' event seems to only fire for left-mousebutton-clicks
[12:29:53] <ccmonster> that's my biggest issue.
[12:29:58] <swiggy> its pointing to the line with the selector and event
[12:30:14] <unomi> is there a way to get all clicks, or do I need to bind to mousedown and handle it myself?
[12:30:25] <ekkis> ccmonster: debug your way to line 30 and see if the call gets made
[12:30:29] <swiggy> i probably have to use .click
[12:30:32] <ch3mical> swiggy: Mismatched single quote
[12:30:35] <ekkis> if it isn't, see if "navigation" exists
[12:30:37] <ccmonster> i know it's getting called, because of the console.logs
[12:30:38] <swiggy> but was hoping there is a checked vent
[12:30:42] <ekkis> if it doesn't, replace with "this"
[12:31:13] <timrombergjakobs> I want to update the span with the data that im receiving from the database.
[12:31:18] <ch3mical> ccmonster: stack trace
[12:31:43] <ccmonster> you want me to output the console.logs to a pastie?
[12:32:09] <predat0r> ccmonster sorry how to run yui comp. if i dont have java :$
[12:32:18] <ccmonster> no clue predat0r .
[12:32:29] <ccmonster> haven't used it myself, honestly.
[12:32:38] <ccmonster> i thought it was an online compressor though
[12:34:31] <unomi> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ <-- click example at the bottom only works with left click, not scrollwheel or any other clicks it seems
[12:35:33] <predat0r> ccmonster thx found online comressor..
[12:35:40] <ccmonster> np
[12:36:30] <ccmonster> so it appears that line 26 is failing on the second go around (recursion)
[12:36:31] <Abjorn> http://www.blackberrycool.com/wp-content/uploads/rimjob500.jpg I can't tell if this was intentional or not.
[12:36:45] <ccmonster> it's working top level, but not on the recursion passes
[12:39:14] <ccmonster> no clue why that is.
[12:40:47] <muley> heya... is there any way to tell when all document.ready callbacks on a page have completed?
[12:42:31] <ccmonster> um, console log them out
[12:42:34] <muley> can i do $(document).bind("ready", handler)? or is there a better solution?
[12:42:42] <ccmonster> not sure mulley
[12:43:44] <benji_> Hi , is there a clean way to manually add a parameter after I serialize a form : $('#my_form').serialize() ?
[12:43:46] <muley> yepp... googling... =S
[12:46:41] <joelt_nz> I need help with jquery ui modal - I've created the modal with:    model = $('<div>modal content</div>').dialog({autoOpen:false});
[12:47:01] <joelt_nz> the later - from a function I call: modal.dialog('open');   but it doesn't open
[12:47:56] <joelt_nz> I'm using the console to see if the scope is correct and 'modal' is set to the right element - so I'm confused
[12:48:02] <ccmonster> ok, im stumped. dont see why this isnt recursing
[12:50:30] <PCNIhelp> Hello
[12:50:33] <PCNIhelp> ?
[12:51:06] <mello> hi, i'm trying to select a parent div using jquery. for all the elements where i want to get the parent selector, it only works for one
[12:51:13] <mello> and i don't know why it works for this one and not for the others
[12:51:26] <mello> alert($(this).parent('div[data-role=fieldcontain]').is('div')); gives false
[12:52:07] <theEric> Is there a way to *always* attach a class to an element  that isn't affected by (hate this part) partial-postbacks in asp?
[12:52:11] <Raylton> so thanks, i  solve it
[12:52:13] <PCNIhelp> Can some assist me? I have been trying to change the slideshow of a website so that the slideshow would begin again from the first image, but instead it cycles back to the beginning.
[12:53:16] <theEric> I'm aware of live/bind, but they don't seem to maintain the classes set on asp action. (I hate, loathe, despise ASP, but its what we used...)
[12:53:39] <mello> theEric, if you are talking about webforms i'd have to agree yes...
[12:54:03] <mello> it's like windows forms on steroids; aka even worse
[12:54:10] <PCNIhelp> I have been trying to change the slideshow of a website so that the slideshow would begin again from the first image, but instead it cycles back to the beginning.
[12:54:28] <mello> PCNIhelp i don't think spamming is going to help
[12:54:37] <theEric> Indeed. The particular project requires a plugin to change the look of the form controls, but if we add ASPX to the mix.. well, it craps out
[12:55:02] <mello> Actually i've had no professional experience with WF, but from what i did do, i can imagine lol
[12:55:11] <ajpiano> PCNIhelp: a) those sound like the same thing. b) you will need to provide some sort of code or code sample in order to get useful help in here :)
[12:55:39] <mello> go jsfiddle.. btw code sample for my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/6LJe5/7/
[12:55:51] <PCNIhelp> Well, the site is pcni.us.com.
[12:55:56] <Daninmass> hey folks, I'm trying to create a light weight image rotator for a background image. I'm trying to use .animate to "push" the current image off the page by altering the absolute position, but all I have succeeded in doing is sliding one image off the page, get blank background and the next image pushes it's way up. I'm not sure ehat this type of effect is called and I'm trying to google ways to accomplish it. does anyone know what
[12:55:58] <ajpiano> mello: use parents not parent
[12:56:13] <mello> ajpiano ok i'll look up the diff
[12:56:19] <PCNIhelp> I was just assigned to make changes to the page. I can't figure out how to change it.
[12:56:34] <ajpiano> mello: parents searches all the parents and filters... parent only looks at the immediate parent and filters only that
[12:56:50] <theEric> I'm thinking of adding a $('*').live('click', function() { reinvokeMyFunction() }); call as a hack
[12:56:52] <ajpiano> PCNIhelp, that's the type of assistance you need to get from someone in your organisatoin.
[12:57:27] <theEric> meh... no good
[12:57:30] <mello> ajpiano ah thanks, seems I got lost there indeed; but would this work for what i'm trying to accomplish? let's see..
[12:57:49] <PCNIhelp> There's no one else in the organisation other than myself
[12:58:01] <ajpiano> PCNIhelp: in here we can only really help with concrte problems or specific questions, we can't give you the proper direction on how to take step 1 of a particular assignment
[12:58:10] <itissid> hey I wanted to host a simple jQuery plugin
[12:58:12] <MrNibbles> evening gents
[12:58:20] <itissid> but i have no webspace for the demo
[12:58:20] <ajpiano> PCNIhelp: then who assigned it to you :p
[12:58:29] <itissid> So is there a way I can still do it?
[12:58:35] <ajpiano> itissid: you can host your demos on jsfiddle
[12:58:35] <PCNIhelp> My boss
[12:58:55] <ajpiano> PCNIhelp: who implemented the slideshow to begin with
[12:59:18] <PCNIhelp> A third party called ready2excel
[12:59:33] <MrNibbles> anyone here ever been to Poland?
[12:59:39] <ajpiano> PCNIhelp: are you familiar with writing javascript and/or jquery
[12:59:41] <MrNibbles> im heading there this week for FalsyValues
[12:59:57] <snover> theEric: That hack won’t work. There is almost certainly some callback or event that ASP.NET fires when a partial has loaded into the page, so stick it in there
[12:59:59] <ccmonster> sup ajpiano . im sure you can clear this recursion stuff up ... cuz im having a hangup
[13:00:05] <ajpiano> what's the question ccmonster
[13:00:10] <PCNIhelp> Just a little. I've only gotten up to chapter 3 of the novice to ninja book
[13:00:37] <mello> ajpiano thanks a lot. that does what i needed
[13:00:47] <ajpiano> PCNIhelp: how is cycling back to the first one different than starting over from the beginning :p
[13:00:51] <ccmonster> I am trying to recursively traverse this json string and create a multi level menu. http://pastie.org/1911302
[13:00:57] <mello> PCNIhelp just read the thigns you need, not the whole book, or that's what i would do
[13:00:59] <ccmonster> however, its only grabbing the  top level
[13:01:38] <abjorn> Finally getting around to cloning my old hard-drive to my new one, since the old one is failing. Had to launch a live fedora disk to do it, though, since windows tools for that suuuuck
[13:01:46] <ajpiano> ccmonster, html really shouldn't be a global
[13:01:54] <ccmonster> k..
[13:02:10] <theEric> snover: unfortunately looks like I'm going to have to do that.
[13:02:19] <snover> I’m not sure how that is unfortunate
[13:02:25] <snover> that’s exactly how you *should* be doing it
[13:02:34] <ajpiano> ccmonster, i think that is defintely part of the problem
[13:02:40] <ccmonster> hmm.
[13:02:43] <ccmonster> so0 what are you suggesting...
[13:02:46] <ajpiano> ccmonster, cause you are clobbering the global html when you start recursing through the child elements
[13:02:55] <ajpiano> i suggest debugging :p
[13:03:02] <Jayflux> evening all
[13:03:03] <ccmonster> ack. been doing that.
[13:03:06] <timrombergjakobs> Really don't want to be a spammer but I explained a problem before but did not get any help. Anyone done a counter before in jquery??
[13:03:07] <MrNibbles> no one heading to falsy this week then?
[13:03:10] <ccmonster> it's traversing through, but not adding the html at all
[13:03:33] <ajpiano> ccmonster, i don't even see where the json variable is coming from
[13:03:39] <ajpiano> ccmonster, if you put a fiddle together with the actual json
[13:03:45] <ajpiano> i can help with that
[13:03:57] <ajpiano> just the like, output of $.xml2json(data);
[13:04:25] <ccmonster> how do i get a string represntation of it?
[13:04:35] <ccmonster> atleast to the console.
[13:04:46] <ajpiano> ?stringify
[13:04:47] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[13:05:54] <ccmonster> hmmm...
[13:05:58] <snover> timrombergjakobs: what does that even mean, “a counter”
[13:06:09] <ccmonster> so are you saying i should use this lib over what im doing to parse the json?
[13:06:17] <ajpiano> what
[13:06:18] <ajpiano> no
[13:06:21] <ajpiano> i'm saying make me a demo
[13:06:25] <ajpiano> that actually works
[13:06:30] <ccmonster> lol.'
[13:06:33] <ajpiano> with the actual object sitting there
[13:06:40] <ajpiano> so that i don't have to deal with all the other noise :p
[13:06:44] <ccmonster> i hear ya
[13:07:01] <ccmonster> and you're saying use stringify to get the text output
[13:07:26] <ajpiano> yes
[13:07:41] <ccmonster> and it's not built into jquery.
[13:07:43] <ccmonster> booo lol
[13:07:51] <sincarne> hello, all! I'm trying to get a serious of elements to show other elements when clicked on. they're in sequence, and i'm trying to append the value via a counter in a for loop.
[13:07:52] <timrombergjakobs> snover: What I meant is that I'm fetching data from a database and the json result I'm getting back I would like to update a span so it looks like a dynamic counter.
[13:08:20] <snover> timrombergjakobs: have you perused the jQuery documentation at all yet?
[13:08:37] <timrombergjakobs> snover: something like this: http://pastie.org/1912222
[13:08:58] <timrombergjakobs> yes of course. I'm just getting NaN right now
[13:09:10] <sincarne> problem is that the variable isn't output as a string, so the variable is always the highest value the counter is set to. The example is here: https://gist.github.com/975242
[13:09:17] <sincarne> i'd appreciate help.
[13:11:55] <ajpiano> sincarne: that is not the right way to do what you're trying to do
[13:12:14] <ajpiano> a) the right way to loop over a jquery object is to use the $.fn.each
[13:12:16] <ajpiano> that is on each
[13:12:16] <gplocke> anyone available to help with a jquery BBQ issue?  I'm having an issue where it's running parts of my code twice, and i'm not sure how to stop that duplication
[13:12:27] <ajpiano> sincarne: but in this case, no loop is necessary
[13:12:40] <ajpiano> you can just do $("#hero-gallery-navigation div img").click(function(e) { });
[13:12:49] <abjorn> damnit, my old hard-drive is so fucked up I can't even clone it
[13:12:58] <ajpiano> and it will bind the same click event to all of the images inside of that spot
[13:13:00] <sincarne> sorry, i should have clarified: that example is really hacky
[13:13:44] <sincarne> what i need to do is have the first image load slide0, the second load slide1, so i need some kind of incremented value
[13:14:01] <ajpiano> there's other ways to do that
[13:14:15] <ajpiano> sincarne: and in the event that you did need to write a loop of some sort
[13:14:22] <ajpiano> to capture the index
[13:14:31] <kanzie> can I use if-clauses in jquery-templates somehow?
[13:14:31] <ajpiano> doing a dom query on every loop iteration would not be the best idea :p
[13:15:01] <sincarne> let me update my gist to something more sane, my fault :)
[13:15:26] <sokie_de> you can mix javascript and jquery, you can use if clauses as u see fit
[13:15:48] <Chad_C> anyone out there consuming a WCF 4 service
[13:18:36] <sincarne> I've updated: https://gist.github.com/975242 this is more along the lines of what i'm trying.
[13:18:40] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hi
[13:18:49] <Nicolas_Leonidas> if you have a div, with an <a> in it
[13:19:00] <Nicolas_Leonidas> and div's id is logo
[13:19:06] <Nicolas_Leonidas> how do you find out the href of the a inside?
[13:19:15] <ajpiano> sincarne: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/hL59p/ is a way to get the index from the dom element instead of capturing an iterator value
[13:19:32] <ajpiano> that particular sample assumes they're all siblings though
[13:20:27] <sokie_de> $("#logo a").attr("href"), N_L
[13:20:31] <ch3mical> Ok, I like dataTables again, now that I have a work around for the thing that was broken about it
[13:20:34] <ajpiano> sincarne: if you really must use the loop index though, you should do so against pre-cached sets, i'll show you how
[13:20:50] <ajpiano> sincarne: the loop index is passed to jquery each
[13:20:52] <sincarne> please do, thanks
[13:21:22] <cool123> any freelaner
[13:22:16] <beasty> ?
[13:22:27] <beasty> what's a freelaner ?
[13:22:44] <ezrafree> i believe they meant freelancer
[13:25:10] <ajpiano> sincarne, something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/hL59p/2/
[13:25:16] <ajpiano> again, it doesn't use a loop
[13:25:56] <Krinkle> The qunit tests are, like, completely broken. What's up with that ?
[13:26:21] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1003/
[13:26:24] <ajpiano> sincarne, this way shows capturing the iterator value

[13:28:00] <cool123> anyone can fix the pagination problem
[13:28:53] <sincarne> thanks, ajpiano, that's awesome. working on it now.
[13:29:08] <sobrinho> hello everyone
[13:29:46] <sobrinho> i need some help with jquery ui button widget
[13:29:49] <sobrinho> someone can help me?
[13:30:16] <sobrinho> i have some buttons on my page
[13:30:30] <sobrinho> and i want to flag one of them as "active"
[13:30:36] <sobrinho> the current
[13:30:39] <sobrinho> like pagination
[13:32:26] <sobrinho> i didn't find any related with that on documentation
[13:33:12] <sokie_de> removeClass() on all buttons of your set, addClass to that Button just clicked
[13:33:52] <cool123> ?
[13:36:08] <ccmonster> if im doing each,  how do i find the length or size.
[13:36:11] <ccmonster> neither appear to work
[13:36:57] <tbranyen> ccmonster: wat
[13:37:08] <sokie_de> $('.myButtons').click(function(){ $('.myButtons').removeClass("active"); $(this).addClass("active");}); cool123
[13:37:26] <ccmonster> im doing a each(myvar,function(i,item){item.size})
[13:37:38] <ccmonster> basically trying to check if its got length,size
[13:37:59] <cool123> what is this ?
[13:38:01] <tbranyen> ccmonster: well i don't know what size is
[13:38:09] <ccmonster> var.size()
[13:38:13] <ccmonster> or var.length(0
[13:38:24] <tbranyen> ccmonster: are items jquery collections?
[13:38:25] <ccmonster> ()*
[13:38:46] <ccmonster> it is json, that i am doing a each on
[13:39:06] <sincarne> thanks again, ajpiano, I got it working. Also need to get using JSFiddle more, it's awesome. Cheers!
[13:39:13] <ajpiano> sincarne: :) woot
[13:39:26] <Daninmass> is there anyway to prevent the "shake" effect from changing inline elements to block elements during the effect?
[13:39:55] <ccmonster> delays and stops i believe Daninmass
[13:40:08] <mavv> hi! quite simple question: i write some plugin and want to additional effect, when mousewheel plugin is also on page. how to check it?
[13:40:15] <ccmonster> or queue, and dequeue
[13:40:40] <Daninmass> imnot sure how that applies to the effect chaning inline to block...
[13:40:56] <ccmonster> it helps with the shaking.
[13:40:59] <ccmonster> i believe.
[13:41:56] <ccmonkey> Is there a way to start an animation at x% of another animation? Like when this animation is at 50%, start the next one, I currently have 3 lines of text in spans sliding in 1 after the other using .animate and callbacks, but I would really like to start the second at say 50% of the first
[13:42:08] <Daninmass> anyone else have any thoughts on the issue?
[13:43:25] <mavv> ccmonkey - if You want to start on this same element, you can put time to variable, then setTimeout(function(){},time/2) and use .stop().animate(...) to second animation.
[13:43:47] <ccmonster> what browser Daninmass
[13:44:11] <Daninmass> ff, ie and chrome
[13:44:21] <ccmonster> hmm.
[13:44:30] <ccmonster> what does your css look for the elements?
[13:44:36] <ccmonster> mock up a fiddle.
[13:44:37] <ccmonkey> mavv yeah, the problem si these are seperate like this span1.animate(callback (span2.animate (callback (span3.animate)))
[13:47:31] <Daninmass> doh, I fixed it, god I love firebug. it adds a temporary wrapper element to the elements it's applied to and the default css for the wrapper is block, I changed it to inline and that fixed it
[13:48:47] <maxmoore14> can someone do a sanity check on this function for me? http://jsfiddle.net/XKMLd/
[13:49:05] <maxmoore14> I'm new to jquery and want to make sure I'm not doing anything dumb
[13:50:21] <maxmoore14> also, you will see I'm trying to apply the ui-state-error class to my message, but it is not displaying correctly - would love some help with that
[13:50:21] <ccmonkey> anyone know how to take this chain of animations and callbacks, and make the second animation start at 50% of the first, the third at 50% of the second, etc. http://jsfiddle.net/7bgZs/
[13:50:59] <ccmonster> hey ajpiano ...that is giving me an error
[13:51:00] <ccmonster> its weird
[13:51:20] <ajpiano> what is
[13:51:27] <ccmonster> JSON.parse, line 527. Just saying return JSON.parse(this,filter);
[13:51:40] <ccmonster> console.log(JSON.stringify(json));
[13:51:46] <ccmonster> but the first part is what it throws.
[13:51:53] <ajpiano> are you passing it an object, or a string?
[13:52:01] <ccmonster> obj
[13:52:48] <ajpiano> i wonder if that xml2json thing is working right
[13:53:03] <Bert_2> Hi, is it correct that it is not possible to use resizable http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Resizable on an <img> ?
[13:53:10] <ccmonster> hm, I assume it's possible it's not, but I'm doubting..
[13:53:50] <Bert_2> ccmonster: was that a reply to me ?
[13:54:18] <bid> hi, can someone tell me what's the problem with my ajax call, http://jsfiddle.net/thAP3/
[13:54:44] <ccmonster> so when i added the json.js file, im getting an error on the page
[13:55:26] <ccmonster> ah. finally. got a string. one moment.
[13:55:31] <bid> if i change "dataType":"json" to "dataType":"JSON" the call is working but retun as a string
[13:55:35] <ajpiano> wait
[13:55:37] <ajpiano> ccmonster
[13:55:40] <ccmonster> ?
[13:55:40] <ajpiano> i just spotted the problem
[13:55:47] <ccmonster> with...
[13:55:50] <ajpiano> your code
[13:55:58] <ajpiano> you just unconditionally append a bunch of html to the end of the dom
[13:55:58] <ccmonster> the stringify part, or something earlier?
[13:55:59] <ajpiano> no matter what
[13:56:09] <ccmonster> hmm...
[13:56:11] <ajpiano> fuck the stringify part, i just wanted to see a plain object of the output
[13:56:14] <ajpiano> so i could rewrite the loop
[13:56:16] <ccmonster> got ya . lol
[13:56:21] <ajpiano> but it shouldn't have become an hour long distraction :p
[13:56:27] <ccmonster> haha.
[13:56:30] <ccmonster> i was doing other stuff too
[13:56:34] <ajpiano> but yeah, the idea that you would want to append every thing
[13:56:39] <ajpiano> doesn't make sense if you're trying to make a nested ul structure
[13:56:41] <ajpiano> ok :)
[13:56:55] <ccmonster> yea.. i didnt mean to append to html
[13:56:56] <ccmonster> one sec.
[13:57:11] <ajpiano> if you want me to actually like do anything i need a live demo where i can iterate the data...
[13:57:15] <ajpiano> it's not THAT much to ask ;)
[13:57:21] <ccmonster> haha, yea. totally haha
[13:57:53] <ajpiano> bid: is the json valid?
[13:58:14] <bid> ?
[13:58:38] <glupek> Hello. I have serialized Python object got through "getJSON()" request. How can I deserialize that object?
[13:58:58] <dodfr> hi all
[13:59:09] <ajpiano> bid: is the "json" that you're returning valid json
[13:59:18] <ajpiano> does it pass http://jsonlint.com
[14:00:42] <dodfr> I used cookie plugin to store 4 cookies and I have a strange behavior under safari, if I reload them, only 3 are seen, so I did a basic document.cookie explode and only 3 cookies are seen. If I open Safari cookie explorer then it show 4 cookies, any idea ?

[14:08:38] <Trisox> http://www.sitepoint.com/books/jquery1/
[14:08:41] <coaster|Coding> because i dont know what my host has implemented
[14:08:51] <coaster|Coding> what version...
[14:08:57] <Trisox> look in source mostly it commented in the source
[14:08:59] <Trisox> the top
[14:09:12] <coaster|Coding> i cant find it in the source but it is in there somewhere just dont know how to find it XD
[14:09:19] <coaster|Coding> thats the problem i would do that first but its not there
[14:09:20] <coaster|Coding> i cant find it
[14:09:23] <Trisox> or try $().jquery;
[14:09:42] <coaster|Coding> thanks that worked
[14:09:45] <Trisox> in console it should give your the version
[14:09:46] <Trisox> np ;)
[14:09:53] <cod3ninja> OK, thanks Trisox.
[14:09:57] <Trisox> ;)
[14:10:10] <coaster|Coding> yes it did :P
[14:10:13] <Trisox> there are online tutorials 2
[14:10:17] <coaster|Coding> thanks thats all i need for now :D

[14:11:48] <glupek> How do I deserialize object which I got by JSON request so I can access it's attributes?
[14:12:08] <Trisox> ?.data?
[14:12:09] <bot-t> Trisox, .data() - Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[14:12:58] <Trisox> glupek: check that out
[14:13:06] <dodfr> glupek : JSON.parse()
[14:13:22] <glupek> Okay, I'll try.
[14:14:33] <Trisox> might also need http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[14:17:00] <asdf2345> hi
[14:17:08] <molavy> i have this code: a={};a[7]=16;a[4]=15;a[12]=13;
[14:17:09] <glupek> I got an object (at I think so - when I printed it, it gave me "[Object object]"). But when I access it's attribute, I have "undefined".
[14:17:10] <molavy> when i want save this list in Dom for future use ,it return an objects instead list
[14:17:35] <queuetip> glupek: try this script: for (i in whatever_your_object_is_called) { s += i + "\t"; } alert(s);
[14:18:20] <molavy> glupek, maybe this is not real object,some time i have this problem that any thing you pass $() retuern an object
[14:18:36] <asdf2345> im trying to figure out how to word the following in jquery: for each select box, get the value of the selectbox and place it in the container located before it, witht he class name .select-value
[14:19:16] <asdf2345> structure is like this <div class="select-value"></div><select></select>
[14:19:57] <Trisox> ?.val()
[14:19:58] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[14:19:59] <asdf2345> actually i need the select's text
[14:20:05] <Trisox> ?.prev
[14:20:05] <bot-t> .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[14:20:05] <queuetip> asdf2345: put what you have in a pastebin first, i don't think anyone here wants to write the entire code for you
[14:20:16] <glupek> molavy, That didn't work. I am not too good at that, so maybe I'll give you more of my code in a moment...
[14:20:28] <asdf2345> i havent written anything because i got tongue tied
[14:20:48] <queuetip> asdf2345: so you expect someone here to write the entire little widget for you?
[14:21:29] <dodfr> glupek : ok, JSON.stringify()
[14:21:42] <molavy> any idea?, i have this code: a={};a[7]=16;a[4]=15;a[12]=13;
[14:21:51] <asdf2345> no i just needed some feedback, if youre uninterested theres no need to be unruly about
[14:21:53] <asdf2345> it
[14:21:58] <molavy> when i want save this list in Dom for future use ,it return an object instead list
[14:22:15] <queuetip> asdf2345: sorry i totally misread it, you were just looking for better wording :P
[14:22:36] <asdf2345> i just need a jumping off point
[14:22:41] <glupek> This is my JSON request: http://pastebin.com/XyN4Ev09 . And this is django view that handles that request and returns a board object: http://pastebin.com/J0qRLaEx .
[14:22:49] <queuetip> molavy: var s=""; for (i in a) { s+= i + "\t"; } alert(s);
[14:23:39] <ccmonster> ajpiano, i made the fiddle
[14:23:43] <queuetip> asdf2345: i think that wording should be fine, although you might want to describe what the container is, although as a developer, i think that wording is just fine
[14:24:25] <ajpiano> ccmonster, ya, i'm working with it
[14:25:01] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/EpKf5/10/ anyone?
[14:25:13] <dtach> Hi, can anyone tell me if the way i coded this is good enough or if you have any ideas on how to improve it or should be done, http://jsfiddle.net/AZAPh/
[14:25:18] <ccmonster> ah. cooll Thansk a million sir.
[14:25:29] <dodfr> glupek : when you receive JSON ajax you can access it directly
[14:26:09] <Trisox> dtach cache #theater
[14:26:18] <glupek> BUt to send an object I had to serialize it.
[14:26:24] <Trisox> var lalala = $("#theater")
[14:26:38] <glupek> And now I can't get to access it's attributes.
[14:26:42] <Trisox> saves some speed
[14:27:00] <molavy> maybe it is about  alert(board.width);
[14:27:23] <Trisox> hey ajpiano
[14:27:30] <molavy> sorry,var board = JSON.parse(response["board"]);
[14:27:32] <dodfr> glupek: stringify your object before sending it
[14:28:19] <Trisox> dtach: i would use window resize to calc the width and height also ;)
[14:28:34] <glupek> dodfr, How do I do that in python?
[14:28:38] <itissid> Anyone on IE can test this? http://jsfiddle.net/hTTNQ/3/show/
[14:28:44] <molavy> try this ,var board = JSON.parse(response.dictionary]);
[14:29:34] <molavy> correct typo "]"
[14:29:40] <dodfr> glupek : dont know pyhton
[14:29:57] <dodfr> itissid : not working, no css applied
[14:30:07] <dodfr> itissid : IE7
[14:30:14] <itissid> bad!
[14:30:34] <itissid> dodfr, thanks
[14:30:49] <molavy> glupek, i know something about python and django
[14:30:55] <glupek> molavy, I paste that code in js script and it's not working. What's "board.dictionary"?
[14:31:36] <glupek> molavy, And can your knowledge help me? : )
[14:31:55] <glupek> molavy, Did you look at my code?
[14:31:57] <asdf2345> i dont think i did it right
[14:32:00] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/EpKf5/10/ anyone?
[14:33:07] <sweb> i'v got 'JSON.parse ' error during load jquery 1.6 in firebug
[14:33:08] <asdf2345> can someone have a look
[14:33:09] <asdf2345> http://jsfiddle.net/38mgV/
[14:33:34] <antihero> How would I get an element relative to $(this)
[14:33:48] <molavy> you don't return board in your view
[14:33:49] <asdf2345> im trying to go through a page of dropdowns and deposit their display value into a div with the class name .select-value
[14:33:54] <Trisox> this is only on mouse event..
[14:34:01] <ccmonster> its a total PITA ajpiano  lol
[14:34:03] <molavy> this just json_data = simplejson.dumps(dictionary)
[14:34:58] <dtach> Trisox: thanks :) and yes planning to load it with ajax then on done move it up
[14:35:10] <Trisox> :)
[14:35:36] <Engin> available options for effects ? (couldn't find it)
[14:35:52] <glupek> molavy, I put a board in a dictionary. Under a key "board".
[14:35:53] <gnarf> Engin: what effects?
[14:36:02] <Engin> blind etc
[14:36:22] <gnarf> Engin: there are no docs sadly
[14:36:27] <gnarf> but
[14:36:44] <ajpiano> ccmonster, the data is really annoyingly inconsistent
[14:36:51] <gnarf> i can pretty much tell you them
[14:36:57] <gnarf> what version of ui are you using?
[14:37:06] <ccmonster> why so? not that I dont disagree lol
[14:37:06] <molavy> you can use this code instead: d = {};d['board'] = board; data = simplejson.dumps(d,ensure_ascii=False)
[14:37:12] <ajpiano> the sub-object of category in the first category is an array with a single object, the second it's a single object, and the third it's an array with two objects
[14:37:17] <ajpiano> it should *always* be an array
[14:37:24] <ccmonster> yea.
[14:37:26] <ccmonster> hmm..
[14:37:27] <ccmonster> one sec.
[14:37:43] <glupek> molavy, Okay, I'll try that.
[14:38:29] <Engin> gnarf, 1.8.12, I'd like to discover possibilities... for starters I'd like to know if I could start show()ing from right and left (the default is left)
[14:38:59] <gnarf> Engin: blind takes up/down/left/right i think
[14:39:07] <gnarf> direction: "left"
[14:39:20] <gnarf> default is "up" on this one
[14:39:31] <ccmonster> i think i might have something fix that
[14:39:32] <gnarf> that might be something i just added to git version
[14:39:38] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.effects.blind.js
[14:40:05] <gnarf> yeah Engin - sorry that one is only available in ui-git
[14:40:09] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/EpKf5/10/ any one an idea how to do this? comments in link
[14:40:15] <gnarf> for the reverse on blind
[14:40:25] <ccmonster> i think this might be better.
[14:40:52] <gnarf> it takes direction vertical / horizontal in 1.8
[14:40:55] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/ui/jquery.effects.blind.js
[14:41:16] <Engin> ok this is good
[14:41:44] <gnarf> Engin: you could use the ui master branch "effects" code
[14:41:58] <gnarf> you'd need effects.core.js and whatever effects you want to use
[14:42:26] <gnarf> Engin: I'm actually working on effects docs at the moment
[14:42:41] <gnarf> Engin: so hopefully you wont need to run into one of us to get info soon ;)
[14:42:46] <Engin> gnarf, great! please do that :)
[14:42:59] <gnarf> also - just check the source, most of the options are cramped at the top usually
[14:43:25] <Engin> of course, I'll check source, there's no documentation what else can I do ?!
[14:43:26] <glupek> molavy, Now it don't work. There dictionary isn't send until I serialize "board".
[14:43:28] <Engin> :)
[14:43:56] <lilis> hi
[14:44:08] <molavy> you must serialize board before code above
[14:44:16] <lilis> i am very new in jquey
[14:44:44] <Trisox> gnarf can you take a look?
[14:44:45] <ajpiano> ccmonster http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/V8AXN/2/
[14:44:51] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/EpKf5/10/
[14:45:00] <lilis> i have this : $('.ocultar_hora').each(function(){                            var calendario =$(this).text();          alert(calendario);          });
[14:45:14] <molavy> serialize is for query from models,simplejson don' know about models
[14:45:19] <lilis> and this it´s ok
[14:45:20] <ajpiano> ccmonster even better http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/V8AXN/3/
[14:45:23] <glupek> molavy, And when I serialize it, it is the exact string. http://pastebin.com/qj7KESiC . The problem is I am not able to deserialize that string to a javascript object, so can I access it's attributes.
[14:45:29] <palhmbs> Uncaught exception: TypeError: '$' is not a function <<-- this tells me that jquery isn't loaded, is that correct?
[14:45:43] <molavy> here is your answer:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2391002/django-serializer-for-one-object
[14:45:48] <ccmonster> Here is a fixed JSON output
[14:45:49] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/V8AXN/4/
[14:45:51] <gnarf> Trisox: sorry, pretty busy, just helpin out engin cuz my head is full of effects code at the moment..
[14:46:05] <Trisox> :D
[14:46:12] <Trisox> i hope not the explode one !
[14:46:21] <lilis>  i want to get of each value only a part of text
[14:46:48] <glupek> molavy, Hey, I serialized it before I came here. The problem for me is to deserialize the object inside javascript.
[14:46:57] <lilis>  help me
[14:47:02] <ccmonster> hmm
[14:47:05] <lilis> :-(
[14:47:30] <ccmonster> only thing is that it's not creating a submenu for advice finder
[14:47:30] <sarkis> hey guys so jQuery("div.view-all-results a").click(function() {
[14:47:35] <asdf2345> ok ive almost got it
[14:47:41] <ccmonster> finderes is the top level, advice would be the sub level
[14:47:54] <sarkis> if div.view-all-results a does not exist... does it fail out gracefully?
[14:48:00] <gnarf> Trisox: actually, that effect is getting a pretty awesome rewrite for 1.9
[14:48:04] <gnarf> tons of new options
[14:48:09] <Trisox> nice :D
[14:48:16] <Trisox> more particals?
[14:48:18] <ccmonster> ajpiano, http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/V8AXN/4/
[14:48:25] <asdf2345> can anyone tell me what is wrong with the following stement: $(".select-value").prev().html($(selected).text()); im trying to pass the value of each selectbox to the class .select-value which is directly before each selectbox
[14:48:31] <molavy> wait a moment, i write your code from scratch
[14:48:34] <palhmbs> I have a slide.js that runs ok with jquery 1.4.4 - but won't run using wordpress latest :(
[14:48:40] <Trisox> if been working with ui a lot last moond
[14:48:52] <Trisox> good stuff
[14:49:03] <gnarf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7069
[14:49:16] <gnarf> an old demo
[14:49:17] <gnarf> http://webcomfort.dk/jqueryui/index.html
[14:49:25] <Ismogoan> is there anyway to debug a 400 bad request from an ajax call?
[14:49:30] <gnarf> doesn't even seem to work anymore
[14:49:30] <gnarf> :)
[14:49:31] <gnarf> nvm
[14:50:01] <molavy> you can ask your question same time in #django channel
[14:50:04] <ajpiano> ccmonster http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/V8AXN/6/
[14:50:05] <gnarf> Trisox: http://gnarf.net/jquery-ui/tests/visual/effects.all.html --- build pinwheel blockfade shear and "sexplode" are the rewritten explode
[14:50:12] <wontoner> Does jQuery have a script loader?
[14:50:19] <Trisox> looking ;)
[14:50:23] <ccmonster> was that json cleaner?
[14:50:24] <gnarf> and "sexplode" has the "random" flag turned on
[14:51:02] <Ismogoan> what are reasons why an ajax call gives 400 bad request error?
[14:51:11] <ccmonster> ajpiano, so im looking at your markup. You are just putting a ul in, but isnt the ul suppose to be inside the <li> parent
[14:51:18] <Ismogoan> while it used to work...
[14:51:26] <ajpiano> ccmonster, ah you're right
[14:51:30] <ajpiano> i knew that something was weird there
[14:51:41] <ccmonster> ha.
[14:51:45] <Trisox> its kind of random also if i see corectly
[14:51:47] <molavy> can you use this code instead: simplejson.loads(serializers.serialize('json', [board],ensure_ascii=False))
[14:52:07] <Trisox> ah you typed it after i clicked link lol
[14:52:22] <asdf2345> any idea why $(".select-value").prev().html($(selected).text()); is wrong for inserting a select's text into a container located before each select box?
[14:52:24] <Trisox> blockfade is neath
[14:52:30] <gnarf> Trisox: yeah, its pretty hot
[14:52:30] <ccmonster> i could always do a ul ul{margin-left:10px} or something, and use a $('ul li').next("ul") to control it lol
[14:52:45] <ccmonster> and ive never used the MAP piece.
[14:52:45] <Trisox> http://gruppler.dojotoolkit.org/ <-- 4th of the bottom is cool
[14:52:48] <Ismogoan> anyone? ...
[14:52:51] <Trisox> falling letters
[14:53:19] <molavy> i have just like above code work in my project:
[14:54:22] <glupek> molavy, I wrote in django channel. Now I will try your code.
[14:54:32] <ajpiano> ccmonster http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/V8AXN/7/
[14:54:45] <Ismogoan> what are reasons why an ajax call gives 400 bad request error?
[14:54:50] <ccmonster> ive neverive never used the map()
[14:54:51] <ccmonster> looks slick
[14:55:16] <gnarf> .map() is sexy
[14:55:25] <bohboh> is this the place for jqtouch support?
[14:55:25] <ccmonster> haha, that's one way of putting it :)
[14:56:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: any chance you saw the sexy .map() version of animateClass ?
[14:56:36] <ccmonster> ajpiano, is that better json output? wasn't sure.
[14:56:51] <ajpiano> i ahven't seen it gnarf!
[14:56:53] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.effects.core.js#L221-295
[14:56:56] <sokie_de> has "bad request" to do with that same origin policy?
[14:57:03] <gnarf> ^^^ sexy .map useage
[14:57:05] <ajpiano> ccmonster it works now, so i gues it's ok :)
[14:57:14] <ccmonster> haha.
[14:57:35] <ccmonster> now i need to  ake a function that mimics this sorta thing and lets me pass in the obj, and get those standard elements out
[14:57:38] <noregret> can toggle() be used on checkboxes ?
[14:57:46] <ccmonster> not so much for building a list, but for querying.
[14:57:51] <gnarf> noregret: yes, but you probably want the "change" event
[14:58:06] <ccmonster> i was planning on using data() or something and putting that json in the page using data()
[14:58:27] <BinaryKitten> noregret yes you can, but it won't toggle the checkbox value
[14:58:36] <BinaryKitten> *checkbox checked status
[14:58:40] <BinaryKitten> just it's visibility
[14:58:46] <gnarf> ajpiano: .map + deferreds + when :)
[14:58:49] <ajpiano> ccmonster: you're on your own for now
[14:58:50] <ajpiano> :/
[14:58:59] <ccmonster> haha. no worries. that was very helpful
[14:59:09] <ccmonster> i was dancing around that solution in various ways
[14:59:13] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano know of a good place to start with ajax deffereds/promises?
[14:59:15] <noregret> BinaryKitten: which can toggle its value ?
[14:59:24] <ajpiano> dans' presentation is pretty good BinaryKitten
[14:59:37] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: yeah danheberden on vimeo ftw
[14:59:51] <BinaryKitten> do you happen to have a link?  i'm giving a presentation on it
[14:59:55] <ajpiano> BinaryKitten http://vimeo.com/22687950
[15:00:20] <BinaryKitten> many thanks
[15:01:05] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: check out that github link i just posted
[15:01:09] <gnarf> it actually uses deferreds + $.when to catch the end of animations
[15:01:44] <BinaryKitten> gnarf it may do, but that's to do with animations.. which is beyond the scope of the talk i'm going to give
[15:01:52] <gnarf> awwws
[15:02:13] <gnarf> I've been so deep in effects code its spilling out of my head
[15:02:14] <gnarf> ;)
[15:02:16] <BinaryKitten> but it's good to know later :)
[15:03:31] <molavy> glupek,any success ?
[15:04:06] <gnarf> back to packing clothes!
[15:04:08] <gnarf> yay!
[15:04:12] <BinaryKitten> lol
[15:06:17] <chrislabeard> can you change a button value using jquery?
[15:07:04] <molavy> $("button").value("")
[15:07:09] <gma> I'm tring to clear some inputs when the user types new data, or edits existing data, in another text input.
[15:07:12] <chrislabeard> hmmm I tried that it didn't work
[15:07:50] <gma> the keyup and keypress events either fire when I don't want them to (e.g. tabbing into the field shouldn't fire the event), or don't fire when I'd like them to (deleting selected text should fire the event)
[15:08:13] <gma> is there an idiomatic way to do it, or do I need to check for all the different key combos that somebody might use?
[15:08:17] <noregret> if i want to just send teh value of the checkbox (either checked[1] or not checked[0]) thru ajax, what's the best call to use? ajax(), getJSON(), post()....
[15:08:26] <snover> gma: good luck
[15:08:37] <gma> snover: ta. so it's hard then?
[15:09:25] <Dev0n> hey, anyone know a good jquery plugin for autocompletion ?
[15:09:37] <snover> gma: if I ever give a talk at jsconf, it will be about the futility of trying to manage text input
[15:09:53] <gma> Dev0n: jquery-ui has one
[15:09:57] <gma> snover: :-)
[15:10:00] <Trisox> BinaryKitten any ideas on this ? http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/EpKf5/10/
[15:10:16] <Trisox> indeed take the ui one
[15:10:28] <Trisox> good documentation etc
[15:10:32] <Dev0n> heh, gma ye, but trying to avoid including the whole ui library
[15:12:23] <Trisox> so you rather use a badly maintained and suported plugin
[15:12:31] <gma> Dev0n: so you can't just tick the checkboxes for the relevant widgets and download a small version?
[15:12:44] <Trisox> also that
[15:12:59] <BinaryKitten> Trisox what am i meant to be looking at?
[15:13:26] <Trisox> my jsfiddle plzz i try to trigger only one form at the time
[15:13:27] <Dev0n> well, if it's recommended over other plugins for jquery, then I'd use it :P
[15:14:05] <Trisox> so not also the second it tried loads of options find closest e.target
[15:14:12] <Trisox> no luck
[15:14:50] <Trisox> i want to edit the button action only in side the closest form
[15:15:20] <lucian_> i'm trying to figure out how i can clone all the chidren of a div and append them in another div
[15:15:45] <Trisox> ?detach
[15:15:46] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[15:16:00] <Trisox> or realy clone it
[15:16:41] <lucian> i've tried $('#div1 > *').clone().appendTo('#div2')
[15:16:47] <lucian> but it doesn't appear to work
[15:17:23] <Trisox> ? .children
[15:17:24] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[15:17:48] <BinaryKitten> var div2 = $('#div2'); $('divselector').children().each(function() { $(this).clone().appendTo(div2); });
[15:17:50] <Trisox> ?down http://api.jquery.com
[15:18:03] <queuetip> so is js fiddle just a long way of typing something into firebug?
[15:18:08] <lucian> BinaryKitten: hmm, i'll try that
[15:18:12] <lucian> Trisox: children didn't work
[15:18:14] <bot-t> Trisox, No results found for 'http://api.jquery.com'.
[15:18:47] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: any idea how to trigger only the event in the closest form ?

[15:19:35] <asdf2345> what is wrong with this stement? $(this +" option:selected").text()
[15:19:51] <asdf2345> this referes to "select"
[15:19:52] <queuetip> asdf2345: you don't need the quotes
[15:20:06] <queuetip> asdf2345: this.option:selected should work
[15:20:11] <lucian> BinaryKitten: hmm, doesn't seem to work. i'll inspect the dom again
[15:20:13] <asdf2345> ok
[15:20:14] <unomi> lucian, are you sure that is what you want to do?
[15:20:22] <unomi> is it for double buffering?
[15:20:35] <lucian> unomi: no, i'm implementing an UI builder
[15:20:40] <unomi> ah
[15:20:48] <lucian> and i want an "emulator" to execute the UI builder's result
[15:21:27] <unomi> the 'naive' way would simply to do ele1.content(ele2.content())
[15:21:47] <asdf2345> that did not work $(this.option:selected).text();
[15:21:47] <unomi> but then you lose non-delegate event handlers etc
[15:22:14] <lucian> unomi: hmm, i'm constructing event handlers afterwards anyway
[15:22:18] <queuetip> asdf2345: try:  $("this option:selected").each   ... i'm fairly certain that's what you're trying to do
[15:22:26] <queuetip> asdf2345: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[15:22:51] <queuetip> asdf2345: or this: $("option:selected", this).attr("rel");
[15:23:14] <asdf2345> ah i forgot about that one
[15:23:36] <queuetip> asdf2345: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/this-option-selected-attr-rel-option-selected-is-not-working-in-ie
[15:23:47] <queuetip> asdf2345: read in the comments of that thread
[15:24:20] <asdf2345> i think i got it
[15:24:23] <unomi> lucian, another way would be a deep clone of ele1 to ele2 and then coerce ele2 to be like you wanted it to
[15:24:28] <ccmonster> hey ajpiano
[15:24:31] <asdf2345> i appreciate the help
[15:24:53] <lucian> unomi: that's what i was trying to do, but it didn't seem to do anything. odd
[15:27:19] <lucian> bah, jquerymobile's UI is annoying with dynamic html
[15:27:26] <lucian> anyway, thanks guys. cloning at least work
[15:27:28] <lucian> s

[15:34:08] <devinrolsen> is this possible?
[15:34:40] <devinrolsen> need to gather its height (content determines its height) and then set its top value to that of its height, but as a negative number.
[15:45:18] <level09> how do I avoid the glitch when using slideToggle ?
[15:51:07] <BinaryKitten> level09 define "glitch"
[15:51:19] <level09> BinaryKitten: one sec, I'll send u a sample
[15:51:34] <BinaryKitten> urm? send me?
[15:52:40] <level09> http://level09.me/companies
[15:53:07] <BinaryKitten> ok?

[15:53:34] <BinaryKitten> i don't see one Level 09
[15:54:10] <level09> BinaryKitten: its a small glitch happens towards the end of the slide
[15:54:17] <level09> I thought it is a known thing
[15:54:33] <BinaryKitten> lilis Lo sentimos, pero este es un canal de habla Inglés (He utilizado un traductor para esto)
[15:56:12] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  thanks, just asked becouse is for me more easy get help
[15:56:25] <BinaryKitten> I understand.. thus why i replied
[15:57:29] <lilis> BinaryKitten:   so i am ver new in jquery
[15:57:59] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  and  i nedd help, is for this that  i am here
[15:58:15] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  can you help me please?
[15:58:40] <BinaryKitten> ok. you will need to ask your question  as best you can, telling us as much as possible. You should also put your code on a website like jsfiddle.net
[15:58:53] <BinaryKitten> once you have that, then someone might be able to help you
[16:01:03] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  http://perpsy.com/index/index.php?q=calendar2/34/2011-05-16/2011-05 this is my  page
[16:01:17] <atoi> How much DI do you jQuery people use? And if you do, do you use a util lib to do it?
[16:01:35] <beasty> di ?
[16:01:35] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  i have 2 arrays  http://pastebin.com/uWqHHBgg
[16:01:47] <BinaryKitten> dependency injection @ beasty
[16:02:50] <atoi> I've been using Python for a year, so I haven't needed it, but now I'm writing some fairly serious JavaScript so ...
[16:03:09] <lilis>  i want to compare the array  but i don't know  how do it?
[16:03:11] <BinaryKitten> atoi what are you trying to do with it?
[16:03:28] <BinaryKitten> lilis compare in what way?
[16:04:37] <unomi> atoi, honestly, jquery is probably not the best match for 'serious javascript'
[16:04:55] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  yes if you see de page i have a calendar day and in the bottom i have a view that  it says Lunes
[16:05:00] <atoi> unomi, I'm not using jQuery. :P
[16:05:04] <unomi> imo, you would be happier with Dojo, YUI3 etc
[16:05:05] <BinaryKitten> unomi i would disagree with that
[16:05:14] <noregret> what is wrong with http://pastebin.com/eBPg342X ? i'm getting "invalid object initializer"
[16:05:18] <bittyx-laptop> hello all, i have a problem with .switchClass() - namely, it doesn't transition between the classes, but rather just switches (even though i have a duration of 300ms set), and it switches immediately, no matter the duration. can anyone take a look at my problem? i haven't been able to isolate it (otherwise, i assume i would've already found out the problem), so here it is in action: http://nsnight.levacic.net/ <--- when you click on the tags in
[16:05:18] <atoi> YUI is awful, are you serious? jesus christ.
[16:05:18] <bittyx-laptop>  the list on top, like "Rock", "Jazz", "Narodna", those hide/show the events (objects) below, and everything works great. except, the links that act as toggles should slowly fade from #fff to #999 and vice versa, instead of switching immediately. can anyone help, please? i've been trying to fix this for a couple of hours already, and i'm pretty much out of ideas.
[16:05:22] <BinaryKitten> don't underestimate it
[16:05:24] <unomi> what are you using atoi?
[16:05:33] <atoi> RightJS, probably. ;)
[16:05:34] <Techdeck> BinaryKitten, have  you played with jQuery mobile? I need some experts' advice
[16:05:41] <BinaryKitten> bittyx-laptop nice massive message there
[16:05:56] <atoi> But I figured jQuery people might have to deal with DI like issues.
[16:05:57] <BinaryKitten> Techdeck i haven't and i'm no expert
[16:06:15] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  and i want to hide the hours in the caledar  that there aren't in the view
[16:06:16] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: sorry, i wanted to explain specifically what my problem is. it's an ugly wall of text, for sure.
[16:06:17] <Techdeck> you're an expert alright, every time I'm here I see you answering people's questions (including mine) :)
[16:06:23] <Techdeck> thanks anyway
[16:06:27] * Techdeck headdesks
[16:06:30] <atoi> Basially, when I prototyped out this little game interface I'm writing, I ended up with a handful of globals. Moving to _really_ code it, I probably don't want that.
[16:06:53] <Techdeck> BinaryKitten, you should by the way, it's pretty awesome. :)
[16:07:02] <atoi> I'm thinking I could just namespace out the stuff I need and then replace it during unit tests.
[16:07:06] <unomi> atoi, what did you find to fault with yui?
[16:07:11] <atoi> So I don't end up passing it to like EVERY single element
[16:07:18] <Techdeck> no chance one of the developers is here, right?
[16:07:46] <atoi> unomi, disregard. YUI is awesome. Wonderful. (I don't have time for tangential conversation about a framework I'm not using.)
[16:07:54] <BinaryKitten> Techdeck try #jquerymobile?
[16:08:07] <Techdeck> doh! thanks!
[16:08:28] <atoi> So if there was an elegant DI module that people us, that would be good to look at... But otherwise, my plan above is how I might approach it.
[16:08:34] <unomi> mhhm, I should get busy as well :)
[16:10:13] <bittyx-laptop> okay, a concise explanation: .switchClass('old','new',300) switches instantly, instead of gradually. the old/new classes define just a regular and :hover link color. the problem can be seen on http://nsnight.levacic.net/dogadjaji <--- click on the white links in the two boxes on top (Koncert, Zurka, Karaoke...)
[16:10:42] <BinaryKitten> bittyx-laptop 300 1000ths of a second
[16:10:59] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: i know, 300ms. if i put 1000 it's the same.
[16:11:17] <BinaryKitten> try a higher amount?
[16:11:18] <bittyx-laptop> as if the duration is completely ignored.
[16:12:01] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: i've put in 10000 (10 seconds). i have firebug open, and when i click the link, i can see that the class switches immediately.
[16:12:45] <noregret> http://pastebin.com/wqeYyAdX any help appreciated
[16:13:12] <unomi> I have to say atoi, rightJS looks pretty wrong to me
[16:13:15] <BinaryKitten> bittyx-laptop might want to switch to /1.6.1 1st off
[16:13:20] <BinaryKitten> and see if the issue still exists
[16:13:35] <atoi> unomi, well, I can't help it that you don't know what's good and what's not. ;)
[16:14:24] <unomi> uh huh, call-by-name? No drag delegates? shrug dude, you are the one wondering how to go about DI
[16:15:20] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: google doesn't host 1.6.1 yet, hold on, while i find the jquery source
[16:15:44] <atoi>  I'm asking if it's even needed primarily. I doubt that it is, honestly.
[16:16:03] <atoi> But if it is, I'd be cool if there was an implementation that didn't look like garbage.
[16:17:01] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: still the same with 1.6.1
[16:17:18] <BinaryKitten> ok
[16:17:46] <BinaryKitten> right so we elliminated one possibility
[16:17:56] <maxmoore14> how do I call dialog('resize') from within dialog('open')?
[16:17:56] <unomi> atoi, I don't know of any modules off the top of my head, but the fact that you can bind functions from other objects to your current object should give you good options.
[16:18:40] <maxmoore14> this is not working...   open: function () { $(this).dialog('resize'); }
[16:19:09] <bittyx-laptop> ok, i've uploaded the version with 1.6.1 and the duration set to 3000 (3 seconds). just a sec, i'll separate the code in question into it's own .js file.
[16:20:08] <maxmoore14> anybody?
[16:20:54] <atoi> mmm, yeah, that's a possibility, but I really need to revisit the namespacing docs in JavaScript...
[16:22:27] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: okay, so the current version is at http://nsnight.levacic.net/dogadjaji and the buggy part of the code in http://nsnight.levacic.net/js/buggy.js - with jquery 1.6.1 and jqueryui 1.8.12
[16:23:03] <necromancer> atoi: ##javascript might be able to help you out better with general JS questions.
[16:23:04] <bittyx-laptop> (nevermind the broken layout, i'll fix that later)
[16:23:11] <noregret> can someone take a look at this please, http://pastebin.com/wqeYyAdX
[16:23:11] <atoi> yeah, true.
[16:24:13] <bittyx-laptop> noregret: i don't know about that, but you shouldn't have multiple elements with the same id.
[16:24:36] <noregret> bittyx-laptop: right, nevermind that now
[16:24:58] <bittyx-laptop> noregret: if you know how many accounts you've got, you can just figure out the rest in php?
[16:25:19] <bittyx-laptop> noregret: ie. if you didn't receive a certain id, you know you should disable it?
[16:25:44] <necromancer> i dunno, i don't see how stuff like dojo or yui is any more "serious" than jquery
[16:26:15] <necromancer> if anything, jquery embraces the conventions and idiosyncracies of javascript more than any other lib out there
[16:26:47] <noregret> bittyx-laptop: can't be done, since this is listing all users, and a user can set/unset that flag at anytime to any user
[16:27:02] <noregret> bittyx-laptop: then i suppose i should pass manual params
[16:28:26] <noregret> how can I send "data[account_enabled]:11" in JSON? it's failing... because of the "[" i presume..
[16:28:58] <noregret> can it be somehow serialized ?
[16:30:07] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  so,  i want to  get the value
[16:30:30] <BinaryKitten> lilis unfortunately i can't help
[16:30:40] <BinaryKitten> maybe there is someone else tht can
[16:31:05] <BinaryKitten> bittyx-laptop sorry i can't seem to see why it's not doing that either...
[16:31:20] <lilis> BinaryKitten:  gracias!
[16:31:46] * BinaryKitten need sleep
[16:32:29] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: okay, i'll repost a bit later and hope for the best. thanks anyway.
[16:32:42] <BinaryKitten> no problem.. and sorry
[16:32:48] <BinaryKitten> its now (minus lag) 12:32 am and have work in morn
[16:34:07] <necromancer> noregret: are you encapsulating the key in quotes? JSON keys have to be quoted, so it would be "data[account_enabled]":11
[16:37:59] <noregret> necromancer: http://pastie.org/1913581 which is giving "invalid object initializer"
[16:37:59] <noregret> any idea?
[16:39:34] <stan_man_can> is anyone familiar with plupload?
[16:42:11] <qom2> could anyone recommend a script that works like this: http://www.happy.fb.se/ ?
[16:42:19] <qom2> I want to be able to slide between different pages
[16:42:22] <qom2> (not images)
[16:42:31] <noregret> can anyone take a look at this please, http://pastie.org/1913581
[16:47:16] <bittyx-laptop> BinaryKitten: meh, just to update you (if you're interested) - i've given up on :hover, and used .animate to change the color, instead of .switchClass, and it works as expected. i guess that's okay. thanks for trying to help anyway!
[16:48:13] * BinaryKitten looks in, sees bittyx-laptop's message and slaps her head.. "Must remember to turn off audible notices"
[16:49:21] <bittyx-laptop> :( sorry for the highlight :/
[16:49:44] <BinaryKitten> bittyx-laptop not a worry, i should remember to turn off the audible part
[17:03:30] <BlaDe^> with html5 drag/drop can i populate an <input type="file" /> ?
[17:20:19] <Nogwater> I think I found a memory leak related to UI tabs.  How can I test to know that it's really a leak?
[17:21:46] <snover> Nogwater: step 1 is to create a test case
[17:22:16] <Nogwater> ok, so I'm using the demo tabs from here:
[17:22:18] <Nogwater> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[17:22:40] <Nogwater> all my code is doing is running $("#tabs").tabs("destroy");	$("#tabs").tabs(); 100 times
[17:24:32] <izola86> Anyone know why when I use replaceWith w/ ajax data to replace a form the submit button stops working?
[17:24:54] <coaster3000> Hi i have a question about the failsafe jquery code that i see in the api browser. What exactly is it doing. and what is it used for? the code is $(function() {
[17:25:13] <coaster3000> and then fail safe code inside the {}
[17:25:20] <coaster3000> what exactly does this do?
[17:27:44] <snover> Nogwater: ok, you do that, and then …
[17:28:08] <coaster3000> hello?
[17:28:59] <coaster3000> what exactly does this failsafe code do?
[17:30:10] <coaster3000> hello? What is this failsafe code do. What does it do i mean. Its in the http://api.jquery.com/browser/ << api browser. And under the ready(fn) function
[17:30:15] <coaster3000> what does this failsafe code do?
[17:30:50] <queuetip> coaster3000: it makes sure that the dom is loaded
[17:31:15] <coaster3000> To use both the shortcut for $(document).ready() and the argument to write failsafe jQuery code using the $ alias, without relying on the global alias, write:
[17:31:20] <coaster3000> that thing.
[17:31:23] <coaster3000> here is the code.
[17:31:30] <coaster3000> jQuery(function($) {
[17:31:31] <coaster3000>     CODE HERE }
[17:31:44] <queuetip> coaster3000: i just told you
[17:31:54] <Nogwater> snover: the process tab in windows task manager shows IE 7's memory usage go up by about 10 MB for every 100x I destroy/recreate, Firefox 3.6's memory also seems to grow, but not as constantly.
[17:32:01] <coaster3000> doesn't the document.ready do that without the code?
[17:32:29] <queuetip> coaster3000: it's just a shortcut, unless i'm completely not seeing what you're asking
[17:32:32] <snover> Nogwater: use chrome’s built in memory analysis tools
[17:32:50] <coaster3000> k then
[17:33:20] <queuetip> coaster3000: at the end of the day, all jquery is still vanilla javascript, so if you really want to see EXACTLY what it does, then RTFM :P
[17:36:32] <Nogwater> snover: I think I'm doing this right... I open my test page in Chrome, open the web inspector, switch to the Profiles tab, take a heap snapshop, run my loop, take another heap snapshot, which shows net growth of about 280 KB.
[17:38:07] <snover> Nogwater: which version of chrome are you running? do you see a collect garbage button in Timeline view?
[17:39:42] <Nogwater> snover: Chrome 11 on Windows, I don't see a collect garbage button, but maybe I'm missing it.
[17:40:22] <snover> you need version 12 or newer (beta channel).
[17:40:35] <Nogwater> snover: ah, if I drill into the function call, it shows GC Event (X collected) a few times.  Is that what you mean.
[17:40:37] <Nogwater> ah
[17:40:40] <snover> Chrome does not reliably force GC in earlier versions
[17:40:51] <snover> it can take several rounds of GC before it actually collects everything in 11-
[17:41:26] <Nogwater> switching to the beta channel now...
[17:46:06] <Nogwater> snover: ok, so this time, I used the collect garbage button, took a heap snapshot, ran my test, collected garbage, and took another snapshot.  now the net memory growth is about 33 KB
[17:46:15] <Nogwater> er 330KB
[17:46:23] <snover> sounds like a leak.
[17:46:35] <snover> which version of jquery are you using?
[17:46:39] <snover> (not ui, regular jquer)
[17:46:40] <snover> y)
[17:47:08] <Nogwater> 1.5.1 (it's what came with the latest UI that I downloaded
[17:47:10] <Nogwater> )
[17:47:41] <Nogwater> should I try it with 1.6.1?
[17:48:08] <snover> nah
[17:48:27] <snover> what you can try doing is check to see if there is garbage in jQuery.cache that shouldn’t be there
[17:49:02] <snover> that’s the most likely source of leaking from the core lib
[17:49:05] <Nogwater> yeah, I don't know what that is :)
[17:49:21] <Nogwater> if you want to walk me through checking that, I'll be happy to
[17:49:25] <snover> it’s a property called ‘cache’ on the jQuery object… :)
[17:49:41] <snover> just type it in console
[17:50:46] <Nogwater> looks like it has 7 child objects, the keys on most of them change if I run my test, but there are still 7 after the test
[17:51:32] <Whirl3d> Good Evening. If I use the following selector with "live" will it work?  $("li.menuItem a").live('click',doClick);  I wanna make sure that it only binds to the child anchor element should a child anchor element of a .menuItem be added to the dom.
[17:53:33] <Chibby_> does anyone know of a good tutorial for jquery ajax?
[17:54:42] <Nogwater> Whirl3d: did you mean direct child or any <a> that's a descendant?
[17:55:39] <Nogwater> maybe you want $("li.menuItem > a")
[17:57:49] <queuetip> Chibby_: http://api.jquery.com/
[17:58:35] <Chibby_> thanks, yeah i'm browsing through that now, was hoping for an actual tutorial though
[17:58:54] <queuetip> Chibby_: there's pretty extensive examples there
[17:59:33] <snover> Nogwater: could you please link somewhere to this test? see ?p
[17:59:33] <bot-t> Nogwater, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[18:00:17] <Nogwater> Chibby_: I've never seen this, but I hear that PeepCode is good.  This video is $12, but maybe reading the docs is a better place to start. :) http://peepcode.com/products/jquery-ajax
[18:00:45] <Chibby_> hmm, probably d:

[18:13:14] <snover> Nogwater: when you are debugging don’t use minified code
[18:16:06] <Nogwater> snover: I'll try to switch it to the source version
[18:19:20] <Nogwater> snover: ok, how's that?
[18:19:32] <Nogwater> (I uploaded the non minified version.)
[18:22:11] <snover> ajpiano: yt?
[18:27:59] <snover> Nogwater: not sure what to say offhand, looks like a leak but I’m not immediately sure why
[18:28:29] <Nogwater> snover: should I open a ticket and see where that goes?
[18:29:22] <snover> you might if one does not yet exist, you might also talk to people in #jquery-dev to see if they have any deeper insight
[18:29:56] <Nogwater> I'll stick my head in there.  I need to be getting home soon anyway.  Thanks for your help.
[19:05:26] <NeedSomeHelp> hello
[19:10:46] <coldhead> this is my favourite thing on all of wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Toot_and_a_Snore_in_%2774#Track_listing
[19:13:08] <NeedSomeHelp> how do I get the 3digit (iso639-3) language code for the user ?
[19:23:06] <Noob_Soup> Hi, I have a form with <input type="text" id="search_input"/> and use $(document).ready(function(){ $("#search_input").focus();  });   but the input does not gain focus on page loading. Any clues?
[19:24:13] <NeedSomeHelp> Noob_Soup, why not use autofocus ?
[19:24:51] <imjoshdean> Noob_Soup: remove your first semicolon?
[19:29:21] <Noob_Soup> NeedSomeHelp: autofocus does not seem to work for me.
[19:30:03] <Noob_Soup> imjoshdean: neither did the semicolon...
[19:30:04] <NeedSomeHelp> Noob_Soup, should work on most new browsers that supports some html5
[19:30:23] <Noob_Soup> FF 3.6.17
[19:31:16] <serio> Noob_Soup: it works
[19:31:17] <serio> http://jsfiddle.net/serio/zGCWd/
[19:32:32] <serio> tested in FF 3.5.17 and Chrome
[19:33:00] <serio> chances are there's something else, is the domready event even firing?
[19:33:05] <Noob_Soup> so simple, yet so strange... does not work for me. And the page is so simple, just a single input form...
[19:33:11] <Noob_Soup> yeah, something is wacky...
[19:33:15] <Noob_Soup> more testing.
[19:33:27] <serio> it works in the fiddle as expected...
[19:33:37] <serio> so, there must be something else breaking it.
[19:33:54] <serio> ?ftj @ Noob_Soup
[19:33:55] <bot-t> Noob_Soup, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[19:34:33] <Noob_Soup> yeah, something else has to be wrong.
[19:34:56] <Noob_Soup> I'll figure it out, thanks all for your help!
[19:39:00] <Noob_Soup> of course... jquery was not loading properly...
[19:39:28] <Noob_Soup> when is sounds like its something simple... it usually is.
[19:39:31] <Noob_Soup> THanks again
[19:43:30] <cc123> hi all - i've got a div that's reloading from ajax pager and im having trouble binding to the reloading of the content (to re-bind all my actions). load(), ready() aren't working - and I guess change() only works for form elements. any suggestions?
[19:48:28] <bonerton> i'm trying to set a div's width according to the width of one of it's children: http://pastie.org/1914230
[19:49:38] <bonerton> the child will most likely be an <img> but will also be <video> and a swf wrapped in <object>
[19:52:07] <coldhead> bonerton: http://pastie.org/1914251
[19:52:09] <coldhead> more liek that
[19:52:16] <q[corwin]> think you need...
[19:52:48] <q[corwin]> nice
[19:57:06] <bonerton> coldhead: thanks, still getting used to traversing the DOM like a sick bitch
[20:00:12] <joeldart> I reset my password for jquery-ui bug tracker but I never received an email and am not sure what are the next steps?
[20:01:43] <daninmass> hey folks. I'm trying to make a fairly simple img rotator. basically using 2 img elements of equal sizes. I tried to make it so the bottom hidden img, "pushes" the image above it off the screen, but it's not working quite right. I could really use some advice here. site url is http://dansplace.zzl.org/
[20:02:03] <coldhead> bonerton: sick bitches are not renowned for their dom traversal?
[20:02:17] <coldhead> but learn all you can about CSS selectors and rock it like a hurricane
[20:02:34] <coldhead> hobs: you know a damn thing about joeldart's issue?
[20:02:38] <coldhead> cc ajpiano
[20:03:27] <daninmass> if anyone could take a look, that would be awesome, I seem to have taken a left turn somewhere
[20:04:09] <coldhead> daninmass: i would use one of the many plugins to do the image cycling for you
[20:04:18] <coldhead> like the popular
[20:04:22] <coldhead> ?g jquery cycle
[20:04:37] <coldhead> oh thanks for nothing bot-t
[20:04:47] <coldhead> google can link you anyway
[20:04:59] <daninmass> im trying to minimize my dependence on plugins, I wont learn much if I do that
[20:05:12] <bonerton> coldhead: ha, thanks, that similie works as well. i was referring to this helpful guide: http://goo.gl/KaLcr
[20:05:32] <coldhead> well if you're in the market for best practices... avoid using onload and setinterval
[20:06:05] <coldhead> and maybe indent your JS :)
[20:06:14] <daninmass> won't fix the issue, but Im always willing to learn better coding, wats the preferred method?
[20:06:39] <Brodingo> .seen ankit
[20:06:40] <coldhead> $(document).ready() trumps onload
[20:06:40] <hsbot> Brodingo: I have never seen ankit.
[20:06:45] <Brodingo> :/
[20:07:00] <coldhead> and daninmass zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[20:07:05] <coldhead> that has a nice alternative
[20:07:34] <coldhead> wow this article is really offensive, bonerton
[20:07:35] <coldhead> thanks
[20:08:48] <daninmass> ok, I changed that, should upload in a second, thanks for the article, anyone have any suggestiosn on my animation quandry?
[20:09:13] <coldhead> i'm still trying to understand your code
[20:09:45] <coldhead> you are using an older version of jquery too :)
[20:10:10] <Brodingo> and why not just have a div that scrolls
[20:10:20] <Brodingo> instead of trying to animate some images separately
[20:10:35] <coldhead> Brodingo++
[20:10:59] <daninmass> more than one way to skin a cat and Im trying to learn one way
[20:11:00] <Brodingo> could even hardware accel with translate
[20:11:07] <Brodingo> no js req
[20:11:12] <coldhead> the current implementation keeps downloading the images repeatedly which is bad for your bandwidth
[20:11:22] <bonerton> haha, howso coldhead? i thought it was informative
[20:11:42] <Brodingo> and your navigation effect makes me want to kill someone
[20:11:45] <Brodingo> probably coldhead
[20:12:07] <coldhead> fuck Brodingo HOW IS THIS MY FAULT
[20:12:12] <coldhead> bonerton: bitches?
[20:12:15] <Brodingo> it just is somehow
[20:12:24] <daninmass> really getting off track
[20:12:31] <coldhead> i understand that it's "street" but in nazi germany killing jews was "street"
[20:13:51] <Finity> guys, I have a question about the fadeToggle effect
[20:14:40] <coldhead> shoot Finity
[20:14:49] <Finity> I'm getting desired results in FF4, but in IE9, I can't get it to toggle /unless/ the div is originally visible (i.e. display: none, not set)
[20:15:01] <coldhead> daninmass: i am trying to do a little demo of what Brodingo suggested, and i appreciate your patience
[20:15:02] <daninmass> ah well, thanks anyways, ill keep at it
[20:15:18] <Finity> also, the last comment on the page, here, http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/, confused the crap outta me :)
[20:16:43] <daninmass> if i used a div with mutiple imgs , thats still basically what I have now and id still need to figure out how to loop the effect
[20:17:56] <daninmass> and i do plan on the interval being slower, jsut have it goign that fast to view the transition easier
[20:21:38] <Finity> here's the code
[20:21:39] <Finity> http://jsfiddle.net/u8ACv/1/
[20:22:12] <Finity> which, oddly enough, runs in IE9 no problem in jsFiddle >_>
[20:22:39] <Finity> I know that the attr portion of the chain is being, called, however, as the link changes from it's default location, to # :)
[20:24:24] <coldhead> daninmass: http://jsfiddle.net/4wAYG/
[20:24:33] <zulax> in order to fire an event when a user browses to upload a file, how do i do it with jquery
[20:24:34] <coldhead> i would try something like that, with a bit of fine tuning, obv.
[20:25:28] <daninmass> hahahah, could you have used a creepier image ;)
[20:25:45] <coldhead> i tried using yours but they wouldn't load in jsfiddle :(
[20:25:52] <zulax> I dont think it is .click() function cause the event should be triggered after the user selects the file to upload
[20:26:12] <zulax> and not after the button click
[20:26:15] <daninmass> it's certainly much smoother than what I have now, thank you
[20:26:20] <daninmass> Ill play around with it
[20:26:39] <coldhead> you're very welcome, daninmass
[20:26:44] <coldhead> show us what you come up with
[20:26:55] <Brodingo> kittiiiiiieeeessssssss
[20:27:24] <daninmass> sure, need a short  dr. pepper break. and for the record I like my navbar effect  :P
[20:27:26] <coldhead> the nice thuing about Brodingo's div method is the JS doesn't need to know what the images are or how many
[20:27:33] <Finity> zulax: could be wrong, as I'm fairly new myself
[20:27:39] <Finity> but the change event might be what you're looking for
[20:27:58] <coldhead> zulax: file uploads are hard
[20:28:05] <coldhead> can you paste your code somewhere?
[20:29:00] <daninmass> coldhead, any thought on how to loop? the effect instead of having it scroll all the way back up
[20:29:09] <Brodingo> coldhead u so smart
[20:29:59] <coldhead> daninmass: you could maybe keep appending copies of the images inside the div
[20:30:04] <coldhead> and keep on scrolling forever
[20:30:06] <Brodingo> just clone the div when yeah
[20:30:10] <Brodingo> that
[20:30:26] <coldhead> you could probably crash the browser after a few days
[20:31:08] <coldhead> Finity: i'm not sure i understand
[20:31:18] <daninmass> what about an infinite scroll and continouly taking the topmost element the using inserafter to move it back to the bottom?
[20:31:29] <coldhead> you know this sets the href to '#' attr('href', '#')
[20:31:35] <coldhead> which it already is
[20:31:59] <zulax> http://pastebin.com/8VxGgu4W coldhead , this is all i have so far, just need to know where to start
[20:33:01] <coldhead> that sounds good daninmass
[20:33:55] <Finity> coldhead: well, now that I pasted it into jsfiddle, and it's working fine there, I'm not sure, either o.O
[20:34:18] <coldhead> Finity: might be something to do with the doctype or quirks mode or some crazy crap?
[20:34:25] <coldhead> i haven't used IE in so so long
[20:34:25] <daninmass> hmm. ok be back in a bit
[20:35:05] <coldhead> zulax: MAYBE you could use blur()
[20:35:18] <coldhead> which will occur once the user moves focus away from that element
[20:35:20] <iszak> just MAYBE
[20:35:26] <coldhead> and you could test val()
[20:35:34] <zulax> coldhead, i m seeing if .change would work
[20:35:36] <coldhead> to see if a file was selected
[20:35:51] <coldhead> change would be a good option, if it works
[20:35:57] <coldhead> but it doesn't happen until you blur either
[20:36:08] <coldhead> GOD EVERYTHING IS SO DIFFICULT
[20:36:22] <zulax> Finity, coldhead Eureka, that seems to work, .change()
[20:38:33] <Finity> coldhead: well, just figured it out, I'm assuming: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/internet-explorer-9-jquery-and-divx
[20:38:34] <coldhead> zulax: be sure and test that across browsers :)
[20:38:49] <coldhead> good luck, Finity  :)
[20:39:16] <Finity> I guess, I'm just going to have to have a non-function top-of-site login link for those people using IE9 with DivX webplayer installed
[20:39:25] <Finity> oh well, just a portfolio site ^_^
[20:39:34] <Finity> non-functioning*
[20:46:43] <TonkaTruck> I'm curious what any of you think a REST error response should look like.  Can't all REST responses be broken down into status, message, and data?  Annoying.
[20:51:50] <iszak> TonkaTruck, depends on how much information you want to provide if it's a public API
[20:52:09] <iszak> TonkaTruck, if it was a public API I'd probably only provide code/status and message, data isn't necessary because they would know what they submited.
[20:52:28] <iszak> although data would be nice.
[20:53:03] <TonkaTruck> iszak: I was simply wondering how some of you felt about it.  In my opinion, data should always be set, just null during status = error, etc.
[20:53:38] <iszak> see the thing with REST unlike SOAP is there's really no specification on how the response should look
[20:53:52] <iszak> which although means it's incredibly flexible, it also allows developers to choose bad design.
[20:54:09] <TonkaTruck> Google "REST error handling" and you get a link to a guy confused in 2009 referencing the oreilly article from 2003.
[20:54:38] <TonkaTruck> And someone else bitching about how twitter's RESTful interface sometimes returns html during a "real bad error"
[20:55:12] <iszak> lol
[20:58:17] <Whirl3d> Good Evening, how does one check to see if an image has loaded? (I know, I know, Google is my friend, but I was hoping to find out how people here have done it and to find out if they have been successful at it or not--things you can't find on Google, btw)
[21:03:37] <TonkaTruck> iszak: Do you know if the $.ajax() "error" callback is a result HTTP status? I need to read more about this.  The docs are a tad vague maybe.
[21:05:44] <dsdeiz> hi! using .animate, how do i make an element after showing it; fade out and removed?
[21:07:49] <daninmass> coldhead you still up?
[21:08:04] <iszak> TonkaTruck, yes error is executed on error status codes AFAIK
[21:08:12] <Whirl3d> dsdeiz, do you want to remove the animated element hafter fading it out? $(element).fadeOut("fast", remove);
[21:09:31] <daninmass> damn
[21:10:00] <dsdeiz> yep though before that i dunno how to make it fade out after showing it
[21:10:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> are these articles encircled by rounded boxes? http://deansofer.com/blog
[21:10:15] <ProLoser|Mobile> can't get the css to refresh
[21:12:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> what the crap
[21:13:54] <TonkaTruck> ProLoser|Mobile: I don't see rounded boxes
[21:14:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> nvm i just found out somethings caching the assets
[21:15:13] <TonkaTruck> ProLoser|Mobile: I like cake.  What asset compressor are you using?
[21:15:25] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's google page speed
[21:15:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's not even cake doing it, which is why i didn't notice it
[21:15:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's an apache module :/
[21:15:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/
[21:16:08] <TonkaTruck> Interesting.  I've been using mark story's asset_compress for a while and love it.
[21:16:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm not complaining about normal solutions
[21:16:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> i just didn't realize this does such an explicit modification of the served content
[21:17:15] <TonkaTruck> Though now I'm building a JavascriptMVC app and using cake as an api only...
[21:17:31] <ProLoser|Mobile> weird
[21:17:41] <ProLoser|Mobile> why?
[21:18:02] <ProLoser|Mobile> nvm, i didn't realize jsmvc is a fw
[21:18:28] <TonkaTruck> It's got a lot of great utilities, too...including asset compressing.
[21:18:37] <ProLoser|Mobile> still, seems like an unusual direction to take for a fw
[21:19:00] <ProLoser|Mobile> wouldn't putting most of the core on client side be bad?
[21:19:08] <ProLoser|Mobile> or does it like work with node or something?
[21:19:32] <TonkaTruck> I think the buzzword is TSA, now.
[21:20:32] <TonkaTruck> Basically the Model is your connection to your RESTful API (in my case a cake app) and your controllers can subscribe to/observe this model.
[21:20:34] <ProLoser|Mobile> can you be more specific
[21:20:44] <ProLoser|Mobile> ah
[21:20:48] <ProLoser|Mobile> so it's a fw for widgets
[21:20:58] <ProLoser|Mobile> like... igoogle or facebook
[21:21:03] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm guessing? iunno
[21:21:17] <TonkaTruck> Yes...it's hopeless as far as graceful degradation goes heh.
[21:21:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> hah
[21:21:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> meh i kinda designed a widget factory in cake
[21:21:55] <ProLoser|Mobile> also, if you don't know of it already, checkout the webservice plugin
[21:21:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> very handy
[21:22:03] <TonkaTruck> I didn't know of it...did you write it?
[21:22:08] <TonkaTruck> Or is it a cakedc?
[21:22:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> no, savant
[21:22:18] <TonkaTruck> Oh sweet...I will, thanks.
[21:22:27] <ProLoser|Mobile> i wanted to expand it to work with jquery form submission
[21:22:50] <ProLoser|Mobile> so that i could display cake session flash messages in jquery like a growl notice or something
[21:23:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> which is pretty much a matter of dictating a convention for the form submission return json
[21:23:44] <TonkaTruck> I do that now...but with JSMVC I'm planning on going further by making my flashes a model...
[21:24:25] <TonkaTruck> I use jGrowl in fact.  http://stanlemon.net/projects/jgrowl.html if you haven't already seen.
[21:24:34] <ProLoser|Mobile> i know of it
[21:24:55] <ProLoser|Mobile> TonkaTruck: what i want though is to make the integration seamless
[21:25:15] <ProLoser|Mobile> although if you think about it all you gotta do is set the validation errors and setflash messages to the json response
[21:25:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> along with a success: true/false
[21:25:44] <ProLoser|Mobile> i heard there's some standard format jquery is used to that i could make it but i haven't looked into it, just been busy
[21:25:47] <TonkaTruck> That is exactly what I do.  Check the Message key in Session and add it to the json response.
[21:25:59] <TonkaTruck> I have Result, Message, and Data in all my responses.
[21:26:11] <ProLoser|Mobile> you should add validationErrors
[21:26:14] <TonkaTruck> Result can be good, bad, info, or warning.
[21:26:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> i want to build a jquery plugin
[21:26:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> that works with the cake one
[21:27:32] <TonkaTruck> My validation errors can be passed to my Flash methods in the app controller, too...as an option.  So I have goodFlash(), badFlash() etc in my app controller.
[21:28:55] <TonkaTruck> So $this->badFlash('failed to save item', array('validationErrors' => $this->Item->validationErrors'));  This all gets output in my application wide json view.
[21:29:50] <ProLoser|Mobile> but see that requires modification
[21:29:56] <anthony_dev> hi. why I cant add function on data that I recieved from jQuery.ajax function ? jQuery('td').click(function() {alert('check');}); this will work only for static "td" elements...
[21:29:57] <ProLoser|Mobile> the beauty of the webservice plugin is it's automagic
[21:30:00] <ProLoser|Mobile> no mods necessary
[21:30:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> adding badFlash and goodFlash means you have to go back and rewrite all of the app
[21:30:34] <ProLoser|Mobile> simply hooking into existing flash messages would be good enough, and existing validation errors
[21:30:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> the only thing you can't always assume is success or failure
[21:31:01] <ProLoser|Mobile> cuz sometimes a partial save is still good
[21:31:02] <TonkaTruck> Shoot I can't find that cake plugin.
[21:31:08] <ProLoser|Mobile> cakepackages.com
[21:31:39] <TonkaTruck> found it, thanks.
[21:32:42] <ProLoser|Mobile> anywho
[21:33:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> i guess good/bad is a decent way to set the success/failure flag
[21:33:36] <ProLoser|Mobile> but it seems like a hassle having to search and replace all the setFlash messages in your existing app
[21:34:13] <TonkaTruck> Yeah this is just how I've been doing it for a few years...it wouldn't be easy for someone to implement my json response view or anything heh.
[21:34:33] <TonkaTruck> automagic would be awesome.
[21:34:46] <ProLoser|Mobile> well like i said, the rest you can automagic
[21:35:01] <ProLoser|Mobile> i was thinking of having 'optional' automgic functionality, like it detects if a save fails or succeeds
[21:35:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> and you only override it for your special scenarios or something
[21:35:25] <ProLoser|Mobile> or, if you supplement the setFlash message to take an additional param
[21:35:57] <ProLoser|Mobile> iunno, lol, unfortunately there is no 1 approach to validation
[21:36:20] <TonkaTruck> I was just asking around in #rest about good practices for REST error responses and that adds a bit of a new challenge which is choosing an appropriate http status for the error...heh.  There is certainly no 1 approach haha.
[21:37:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> ya see the funny thing is a bad response to .ajax() isn't the same as a save failure
[21:37:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> it means the page 404'd or something
[21:38:07] <ProLoser|Mobile> i mean if you can figure out what jquery might auto-hook into (like success: true/false) you just need to set that value
[21:38:31] <TonkaTruck> That's what I thought...that $.ajax's error callback was for only bad requests...but in REST, I think the idea is that you find an appropriate HTTP response code to fit your error condition...
[21:38:58] <TonkaTruck> http://www.dalouche.com/wordpress/2009/04/25/error-handling-in-rest-applications-best-practices/
[21:39:29] <TonkaTruck> Mind you, his article references the #2 google result for "REST error handling" which is from...2003.
[21:42:09] <TonkaTruck> I thought this was ridiculous until I read the list of http status codes including Status 418 "I'm a teapot"
[21:45:39] -zermet- $10 dollar obey survey http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7FYJH3F sh
[21:46:34] <gnarf> zermet: ???
[21:46:45] <gnarf> zermet: are you spamming?
[21:47:26] <zermet> not really.
[21:47:52] <gnarf> zermet: so what does that survey that you marked up in some sort of boldness have to do with jquery?
[21:47:59] <gnarf> lolz
[21:48:29] <srj55> I want to submit my form via .ajax() or .get().  Is there an easy way to pass the form values into the .ajax() or .get() function, other than doing it by explicitly building a URL string like in:  http://www.ryancoughlin.com/2008/11/04/use-jquery-to-submit-form/
[21:48:56] <TonkaTruck> srj55: The jquery Form plugin is pretty good.
[21:49:13] <TonkaTruck> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[21:50:19] <srj55> TonkaTruck: cool, i'll check that out.
[21:54:59] <TonkaTruck> ProLoser|Mobile: Yeah, .ajax() error callback runs if my REST interface returns "HTTP/1.1 418 Im a teapot"
[21:55:09] <TonkaTruck> Looks quite funny in firebug, too haha.
[21:55:45] <TonkaTruck> But the json error document travels fine.
[21:57:44] <gnarf> srj55: see ?serialize
[21:57:44] <bot-t> srj55, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[21:58:45] <srj55> gnaf: cool, that's what i'm looking for!
[22:01:46] <ProLoser|Mobile> TonkaTruck: what an obscure easter egg
[22:01:53] <ProLoser|Mobile> i want to add that to my site
[22:02:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> i had this other nifty idea for a website where the content of the site changes as you zoom in and out
[22:02:06] <TonkaTruck> I know haha.  I'm adding it, too.
[22:02:20] <ProLoser|Mobile> like to view the main nav, you zoom out
[22:02:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> and to view articles you zoom in
[22:02:29] <TonkaTruck> Oh that would be awesome.
[22:02:41] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: be careful on trackpads -- specially mac - you can scroll for a while with just a small swipe
[22:03:23] <TonkaTruck> Oh wow...would scrolling actually move you in and out?  I didn't even think about that.
[22:03:27] <gnarf> like track the delta of the scroll speed and only grab it when the scroll is accelerating is prolly a good way to do it
[22:03:43] <TonkaTruck> That hurts my head.
[22:08:19] <abjorn> sup
[22:09:03] <srj55> I want my 2 form text boxes to have 'light' text decriptions until the user focuses on these boxes...very common.  Does jquery have a simple plugin for doing this, or is there a simple piece of code for this?
[22:13:42] <ProLoser|Mobile> css :hover
[22:13:48] <ProLoser|Mobile> or $('input').hover
[22:13:52] <ProLoser|Mobile> learn css
[22:14:31] <oksushi> srj55: http://davidwalsh.name/html5-placeholder
[22:15:01] <oksushi> no doubt there is a jquery equivalent
[22:15:25] <ProLoser|Mobile> TonkaTruck: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol
[22:15:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm adding that to my rest protocol
[22:15:50] <TonkaTruck> Oh yeah...I mean it's IN the RFC haha
[22:16:33] <abjorn> ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
[22:16:57] <TonkaTruck> hi abjorn haha
[22:17:19] <abjorn> and with strange aeons even death may die, tonkatruck :p
[22:17:20] <abjorn> sup
[22:17:24] <mgeary> hey folks. i'm having some problems with $.getJSON. i'm calling a google maps api in Safari, and i keep getting jsonFailed to load resource: cancelled. My code is super simple: http://dpaste.org/srdr/. Can you see what i'm doing wrong?
[22:17:51] <mgeary> inspecting the activity with Charles Proxy indicates that the google request is returning the desired data, but Safari isn't picking it up somehow
[22:18:45] <hobs> coldhead: checking into it
[22:19:14] <mgeary> ah, duhh. it's a cross-site-scripting issue. of course
[22:19:20] <mgeary> sigh
[22:19:29] <TonkaTruck> ProLoser|Mobile: regarding status codes, I just read this http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1392-Handling-AJAX-Errors-With-jQuery.htm and someone in the comments says "your way sucks"...at which point ben responds almost a year later and says "You're right..." haha
[22:19:46] <hobs> coldhead: it looks like I dont have access to that one
[22:20:02] <TonkaTruck> And this new post was born http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1860-Using-Appropriate-Status-Codes-With-Each-API-Response.htm
[22:25:06] <srj55> oksushi: i found:  jquery.overlabel

[23:00:45] <stan_man_can> Firebug is showing this error... anybody ever seen it? uncaught exception: [Exception... "Could not convert JavaScript argument" nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)" location: "JS frame :: http://10.100.4.4/javascript/jquery/jquery.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 1" data: no]
[23:02:00] <Cork> stan_man_can: ajax call?
[23:02:06] <stan_man_can> Cork: Yeah
[23:02:17] <Cork> your trying to send a dom object
[23:02:20] <Cork>  :)
[23:02:40] <stan_man_can> ah
[23:03:20] <quuxman> how to select all the elements in a set except the first?
[23:03:57] <Cork> $().first().netAll();
[23:04:03] <Cork> *nextAll
[23:04:09] <quuxman> Cork: thanks
[23:05:03] <stan_man_can> Cork: you were right :) I forgot to add the .val()
[23:05:05] <stan_man_can> thanks
[23:05:46] <quuxman> Cork: nextAll is relatively new, eh?
[23:06:11] <Cork> no its been in there for quite some versions
[23:11:12] <materialdreams> is there a nice documentation of the differences between attributes and properties so important now in jQuery 1.6?
[23:14:33] <jiangquan> i want to get flexigrdid's page num,who can help me?
[23:14:52] <jiangquan> i want to get flexigrid's page num,who can help me?
[23:15:01] <TenJack> hey, i am using jquery templates in netbeans and the syntax highlighting is all messed up.  is there a plugin for netbeans or a better ide?
[23:15:31] <jiangquan>  i want to get flexigrid's page num,who can help me?
[23:25:07] <O0ddity> so can anyone tell me why i can't call jQuery from inside a function that was called by jQuery?
[23:25:14] <O0ddity> http://jsfiddle.net/zv_odd/6QDCy/1/
[23:29:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> O0ddity: how long have you been coding?
[23:29:42] <O0ddity> quite a ling time
[23:29:51] <ProLoser|Mobile> then how do you separate parameters to a function?
[23:29:53] <O0ddity> but mostly C and php
[23:30:07] <O0ddity> with a comma?
[23:30:12] <ProLoser|Mobile> and what are you using?
[23:30:18] <O0ddity> function( parameter1 , parameter 2)
[23:30:31] <ProLoser|Mobile> in your example
[23:30:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> look closely
[23:30:38] <O0ddity> you mean :
[23:30:48] <ProLoser|Mobile> yes
[23:31:02] <O0ddity> i thought i read thats howto use css
[23:31:21] <O0ddity> it's not?
[23:31:21] <ngharo> O0ddity: that's if you pass an object
[23:31:56] <ngharo> i.e. css({foo: 'bar', a: 'b'})
[23:32:06] <O0ddity> oh ns
[23:32:08] <O0ddity> lol
[23:32:15] <ngharo> else it's just css('foo', 'bar')
[23:32:24] <O0ddity> so jq does work fin when i call a function like that
[23:32:50] <O0ddity> oh damn lol
[23:33:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> read the api dude
[23:33:38] <O0ddity> i thought there was some weird object inheritance going on
[23:33:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> lots of method overloading
[23:33:48] <O0ddity> lol
[23:33:52] <ProLoser|Mobile> you didnt' do {}
[23:33:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> so no
[23:34:05] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/EpKf5/8/ can someone take a look i only want to edit the the closest form not the other as well
[23:36:40] <dr0id> Gurpartap: THERE ?
[23:38:07] <ngharo> Trisox: $(this).closest('form')
[23:38:17] <coldhead> Gurpartap: can you prevent Lampoon's logs being indexed in search engines?
[23:38:19] <Trisox> tried that..
[23:38:24] <ngharo> also would help if you close out the form tag properly ;)
[23:38:32] <coldhead> bot-t: tell Gurpartap can you prevent Lampoon's logs being indexed in search engines?
[23:38:32] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.

[23:40:55] <ngharo> you know it
[23:40:56] <coldhead> you should change your nick, jresig
[23:41:14] <jresig> im never using jquery again, i give up on it
