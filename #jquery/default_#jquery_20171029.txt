[04:46:08] <morfin> i am using old jQuery 1.12 and .attr return object itself instead of attribute value why?
[04:46:16] <morfin> bug?
[04:52:34] <morfin> same result with 1.10.2
[04:59:51] <morfin> i think i found critical bug
[05:06:42] <morfin> or it's just tinymce conflict
[09:14:53] <linux_> Hello, How can I see the format of data comes from a url by ajax before dealing with it and showing it
[09:17:54] <linux_> no one here?
[09:19:56] <illy> console.log ?
[09:20:25] <linux_> how?
[09:20:54] <illy> which browser are you using?
[09:21:17] <linux_> I dont see that wjhen reloading the page
[09:21:28] <linux_> firefox
[09:21:57] <illy> when you use console.log what do you see?
[09:22:09] <illy> (assuming you've got the console open)
[09:22:35] <illy> (assuming you've got the console open - or is that the issue?)
[09:22:53] <linux_> nothing
[09:24:02] <illy> have you tried just using curl to see what comes back?
[09:24:21] <illy> (curl on the Linux command line, I mean)
[09:24:58] <linux_> no
[09:25:44] <illy> That's probably a good starting point so that you can narrow down where the problem lies
[09:25:47] <linux_> the console gives The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. .....
[09:26:11] <linux_> it is actullt a simple page
[09:26:53] <illy> what's the response code? is it a 200?
[09:27:07] <illy> use "curl -I" to see taht
[09:27:13] <illy> that
[09:28:43] <linux_> ReferenceError: curl is not defined
[09:31:03] <illy> sorry - I've got to go but you might find this helpful in learning how to use curl

[10:01:31] <morfin> can i somehow return $.attr behavior broken by tinymce?
[10:02:24] <morfin> there is old tinymce used and i have no way to fix it
[10:03:25] <morfin> i need .attr(attr_name) return value of attribute and .attr(attr_name, value) to set value of attribute
[10:03:49] <morfin> but tinymce somehow hacked it to return object itself instead
[10:47:30] <lemonsparrow> whats the camelcase for api_key_id ?
[13:41:31] <dFence> hey guys! I have a chunk of form elements that I’m swapping out with a different set via $.ajax() / replaceWith - do I have to refresh something if I want to have the original listener capture the onChange elements in the replaced bit?
[14:21:31] <shoky> dFence: if you binded the original listener on the elements that were replaced, then yes you'd need to bind again. but usually you can delegate the event handling to a parent/ancestor element (one that is not replaced) and then you don't need to re-bind
[14:22:12] <shoky> read about event delegation in docs for .on()  or  https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:22:27] <dFence> shoky: I’m listening on $('#selectID‘).change - the select is replaced as well
[14:22:29] <dFence> thanks!
[17:07:24] <tsukasadt> I need some help with dynamically appending elements cloned using .clone() and clearing the contents of TEXTAREA (grand)children of the clones. The cloning works just fine, but the clearing only works the first time the event is activated. My code can be found at: https://www.bootply.com/wOBDuQjFSf
[17:08:57] <tsukasadt> If you click the "+" button for any of the fields, it will clone the last corresponding row and clear the TEXTAREAs the first time, but after that it will just clone it without clearing the TEXTAREAs. I can't figure out what I'm missing. :S
[17:24:24] <tsukasadt> Figured it out. I needed to use .val() instead of .text() to clear the TEXTAREAs. ^^'

[19:26:57] <bigLanky> I am trying to build a select menu where there are parent items and 1 level of child items... basically I have a form that lists US states and then a handful of cities under each city
[19:27:20] <bigLanky> I want the user to be able to select cities individually, but if they just select the state, all cities for that state would also get selected and submitted with the form
[19:27:52] <bigLanky> trying to get some idea on waht to do here as far as UI/UX
[19:28:24] <bigLanky> was thinking maybe just have a list of states first, when one state is enabled, expand the cities and have all selected then the user can uncheck the ones they want
[22:11:08] <NitroLiq> I have two buttons with on click events on them that use window.location in the anonymous function portion to go to specific URLs. Is there a way I can abstract these into  generic funciton for links where I just pass in the url ala something like: goToURL('http://someplace.com');
