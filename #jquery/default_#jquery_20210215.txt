[03:20:39] <ckb> hey guys, in inspector I have a value with {} after it with one version and not in the other, and I'm thinking it might be causing problems
[03:21:17] <ckb> both look EXACTLY the same but one has {}
[03:21:47] <ckb> oh wait
[03:23:10] <ckb> nope, nevermind, they're exactly the same.
[03:23:22] <Cork> ckb: try to make a jsfiddle showing what your talking about
[03:26:38] <ckb> Cork: I really wish I knew how to quickly do this.
[03:27:00] <ckb> I know how to do it but it takes so long
[03:29:36] <Cork> not much i can help you with in that case
[03:31:41] <ckb> well I'm also using a 3rd party lib, which I don't know if anyone would help. (FullCalendar)
[03:32:01] <ckb> I will make a jsfiddle (one for each)
[03:32:26] <ckb> but it's literally the SAME data, 2 different functions.
[03:33:08] <ckb> can I post images? before I try to recreate in jsfiddle?
[03:33:39] <Cork> you can, but i can't inspect an image so it won't help
[03:34:01] <ckb> that's fine, but it can atleast give you an idea, if you still can't understand I'll try jsfiddle
[03:36:07] <ckb> I -think- I just figured it out
[03:36:31] <ckb> "Deprecation warning: value provided is not in a recognized RFC2822 or ISO format. moment construction falls back to js Date(), which is not reliable across all browsers and versions. Non RFC2822/ISO date formats are discouraged and will be removed in an upcoming major release. Please refer to http://momentjs.com/guides/#/warnings/js-date/ for more info."
[03:41:55] <ckb> let me clean this up a bit, Cork. One moment.
[03:53:28] <ckb> no matter how I try it, it just doesn't work. images incoming one sec
[03:54:43] <ckb> Cork: https://imgur.com/a/q2tq4QC
[03:55:08] <ckb> do you see anything inherently different?
[03:56:53] <Cork> its an image, like i sad can't do much with images
[04:02:43] <ckb> Cork: jsfiddle is giving me no console errors
[04:03:22] <ckb> ah one sec
[04:44:12] <ckb> I am going crazy...
[04:45:44] <ckb> I know what the problem is, actually, Cork.
[04:48:24] <ckb> UGH
[08:40:44] <Rob_Jones> can someone advise me why my code breaks from this line?
[08:40:45] <Rob_Jones> $('#download-link').attr('href', ${data.download});
[08:51:02] <Robdgreat> Rob_Jones: what error are you getting? Is the ${} strictly necessary?
[08:51:47] <Rob_Jones> yeah got the answer from discord, it was the template literal not neede
[08:51:48] <Rob_Jones> needed
[11:16:55] <dimi1947> do you think juery validate is(still) a good solution for validating forms?
[11:17:43] <toomanytacos> why wouldn't?
[11:18:33] <dimi1947> I have no reason to disagree....I just see it is no developed anymore...thae last time code was added is 2017
[11:27:35] <toomanytacos> yeah that's a concern, mostly for the jQuery version compatibility
[11:32:33] <dimi1947> well...the good thingg is that it seems to be wroking with the latest version 3.5.1...just tested it
