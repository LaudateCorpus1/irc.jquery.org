[00:00:17] <Mizar-jp__> jqm1.3.1 remove "?id=001" string from anchor href "#hashtest?id=001" ... wtf?  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/76253363/jqm/20130605/jqm131.html
[00:00:17] <Cork> boytoy: but that important point is to only use it as a hint
[00:00:32] <sacrilicious> good moring,
[00:00:33] <Cork> boytoy: cause it will give false misses
[00:01:19] <Cork> Mizar-jp__: uh ? after a hach??
[00:01:30] <boytoy> Cork: gotcha, thx
[00:01:37] <Cork> are you sure you dant mean ?id=001#hasjhtest ?
[00:02:25] <anli> I can only see error count in firefox, but not the errors
[00:02:41] <sacrilicious> i have lots of images on this webpage ( http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-gundlach-june-webcast-presentation-2013-6?op=1 ), any idea how i download them
[00:03:30] <Mizar-jp__> push "hashtest" button, may be jump to "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/76253363/jqm/20130605/jqm131.html#hashtest", not "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/76253363/jqm/20130605/jqm131.html#hashtest?id=001"

[00:09:41] <furyFoo> Hi everyone . I'm trying to set the margin left for all images in a section tag. The margin left is set in relation to width of a article tag containing the section tag.
[00:09:41] <furyFoo> However it seems that I've ran into a logic error.
[00:09:41] <furyFoo> Here's the code :  $("section:nth-of-type(2) img").each( function () {this.css("margin-left" , (articleWidth - (this.width()))/2 )} );
[00:11:00] <furyFoo> Any opinions on what went wrong ?
[00:12:00] <coldhead> we're not seeing articlewidth, it might screw up if it has px on the end or somesuch
[00:12:10] <coldhead> and we don't know what's "wrong" in what you're seeing
[00:16:14] <Nebros> good morning. im learning (ok, i try to learn) jQuery. i found this page http://try.jquery.com/ and i think its good made till now. :)   the problem now, i did not understand what they really wont now. this is the given code http://jsfiddle.net/tzvFe/ and this the purpose:
[00:16:16] <Nebros> Let's add a bit more incentive to get people to book these tours by offering a discount if they book today. The discount we want to offer is stored in a data attribute on the .tour element. Traverse from the clicked button, $(this), to the closest .tour element, and save its discount in a variable called discount within the button click event handler.
[00:16:16] <furyFoo> articleWidth is a var calculated before the function it's just $("article").width()
[00:16:39] <Nebros> can someone explain me a bit, what i have really to do? ^^
[00:16:55] <Nebros> but pls, dont post me the answer!
[00:17:03] <furyFoo> I was hoping to avoid the debugging process , since that's always a joy.
[00:17:11] <furyFoo> Seems that this is not my day
[00:18:20] <coldhead> bye forever, furyFoo
[00:18:26] <coldhead> you big ol' jerk
[00:19:39] <coldhead> they want you to traverse using closest() to find a particular element and use data() to extra some data from the DOM and save that into a var
[00:19:47] <coldhead> it's not especially obvious
[00:21:09] <Nebros> hmm, ok. ill try it. thx :)
[00:21:48] <coldhead> good luck buddy
[00:22:00] <Nebros> thx coldhead
[00:23:16] <Daniel1809> Hello, I have created a HTML form in an overlay. The submitted form fields and their values should be listed in the main document (i.e. not in the overlay). But somehow it is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/
[00:26:06] <anli> I suddenly have problems reading values from inputs, .val() becomes an empty string and firebug also does not report value being set, but the text is visibile in the box
[00:26:26] <anli> oh, did it wrong, used text() instead
[00:26:35] <anli> doh
[00:27:17] <Daniel1809> anli are you talking about my code?
[00:27:24] <anli> no :)
[00:27:30] <anli> sorry
[00:27:30] <Daniel1809> pity
[00:28:54] <Daniel1809> Anyone who can check my issue?
[00:28:54] <Daniel1809> Hello, I have created a HTML form in an overlay. The submitted form fields and their values should be listed in the main document (i.e. not in the overlay). But somehow it is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/
[00:28:56] <coldhead> this code is very gomblex, Daniel1809
[00:29:40] <Daniel1809> maybe, yes... do you know why it is not listing the submitted values as a list in the main document?
[00:30:44] <coldhead> i can't even see where in the code that would happen
[00:30:56] <coldhead> and i can't get the submit to work properly to see the misbehaviour
[00:32:15] <coldhead> Daniel1809: #my_submission is inside #my_form
[00:32:23] <coldhead> maybe it should be somewhere else?
[00:32:25] <Daniel1809> fill out every field in the form (password at least 6 characters with aA and a number) then click on submit... then confirm with yes and then the submitted values should be listed in the main document... but I see the whole form then... I just want to have a list like I wrote in lines 58-68 in the code
[00:33:54] <Daniel1809> where shall I put #my_submission then?? May you could update the code? :S
[00:35:17] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/1/
[00:35:20] <coldhead> that works better
[00:35:25] <coldhead> you might want to hide the form as well
[00:35:28] <coldhead> but i see your list
[00:35:40] <coldhead> i just moved #my_submission to after the overlay opening link
[00:37:54] <Daniel1809> Oh man, why did not I have that thought?? And how to adapt the code when I just want to have the list of the submitted values and not the form as well?
[00:38:10] <coldhead> $('form').hide() ?
[00:38:41] <banttu> does datatables have an irc channel or can I go right ahead and lay it on you guys?
[00:39:17] <coldhead> i think this is the place, banttu
[00:39:29] <coldhead> it's certainly never stopped any of the hundreds of querants who have preceded you
[00:39:53] <Cork> banttu: "databases"? do you have a specific engine in mind?
[00:40:03] <coldhead> datatables, Cork
[00:40:05] <coldhead> read better
[00:40:10] <Cork> opps
[00:40:12] <coldhead> :D
[00:40:25] <coldhead> some cunt left me a comment today that said lrn2breakpoint
[00:40:38] <Cork> heh
[00:40:51] <coldhead> lrn2notbeacunt
[00:41:34] <banttu> :) brilliant. Cork: it's datatables*
[00:44:43] <Daniel1809> coldhead: Where to put that $('form').hide();? I am just confused now
[00:45:02] <houser> how do you guys test your layout on different screen resolutions? Do you use some tool for that?
[00:45:21] <Cork> houser: there is one quite nice one built into firefox
[00:45:54] <Cork> houser: ctrl+shift+m
[00:45:56] <banttu> I'm getting this -> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'TableTools' of undefined <- Even after upgrading my Datatables to the latest offering from github
[00:46:38] <banttu> along with the -> Warning: TableTools 2 requires DataTables 1.9.0 or newer... <- alert
[00:47:59] <coldhead> Daniel1809: just before or after you add the entries to #my_submissions
[00:48:05] <coldhead> that should be obvious to you
[00:48:16] <coldhead> "here is where i show the submissions so here is where i'll hide the form"
[00:52:53] <Daniel1809> is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/5/
[00:53:39] <houser> Cork, ah, nice. thanks
[00:56:01] <dylan9o4_> can somebody tell me what this is? http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[00:56:30] <dylan9o4_> Are all these options mentioned standard with form elements?
[00:56:55] <Cork> dylan9o4_: more or less
[00:57:08] <Cork> ?g mdn input
[00:57:09] <b-ot> Cork: <input> - HTML | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[00:57:13] <bot-t> Cork, <input> - HTML | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[00:57:26] <Cork> dylan9o4_: ^
[00:57:29] <dylan9o4_> Cork: because, I haven't seen the "customDatalist" attribute anywhere
[00:57:39] <dylan9o4_> except here
[00:58:02] <Cork> dylan9o4_: that's options not an attribute
[00:58:05] <houser> woot...in iphone really have 1136 pixels in the height? thats more than more laptop screen
[00:58:20] <dylan9o4_> Cork: wait how would I set the option then?
[00:58:39] <Cork> dylan9o4_: check the page you linked to
[00:58:46] <Cork> it's stated right there
[00:58:59] <dylan9o4_> document.getElementById("DL").customDatalist?
[00:59:10] <Cork> uh, no
[00:59:20] <Cork> that would be a property
[00:59:32] <dylan9o4_> Cork: sorry it's very late
[01:01:31] <Cork> dylan9o4_: http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/webforms/3-webforms-widgets.html#configure-ui
[01:03:55] <Daniel1809> coldhead ?
[01:05:38] <SomeoneWeird> know any plugins/libs that allow me to use left and right keys to navigate page or something
[01:07:14] <Cork> $(window).keydown(function(event) { case(event.keyCode) {} });
[01:08:24] <SomeoneWeird> of course, was just wondering if there was anything better :P
[01:13:03] <Daniel1809> Does anyone know how to hide the form in the main document when the form in the overlay is submitted? is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/5/
[01:13:58] <Cork> $('#my_form').submit(function() { $('#my_form').hide(); });
[01:16:05] <Daniel1809> where to put that exactly in my code? I already put  $('form').hide(); in line 66
[01:17:53] <Cork> Daniel1809: well that should do
[01:18:41] <coldhead> great work everyone
[01:19:18] <dylan9o4_> Cork: of coarse on that page they have no implementation of a regular text datalist lol. I just would like to see if it is possible to set the amount of rows the datalist shows before it becomes scrollable, and I thought this would be my best bet considering I don't think it can be done otherwise
[01:19:53] <Cork> dylan9o4_: that most likely comes from css so... ya
[01:19:54] <Daniel1809> it is still not hided: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/7/
[01:20:18] <Daniel1809> *hid (English is not my native language)
[01:20:23] <coldhead> hidden*
[01:20:55] <Cork> uh, the form overflows the height of the viewport
[01:20:55] <Daniel1809> oops
[01:21:02] <Cork> you should have it support scrollbars...
[01:21:09] <Daniel1809> how can I do that?
[01:21:28] <dylan9o4_> Cork: I'm pretty sure it can't be done like that, I mean I've tried using CSS and looking around for something like the "size" attribute the select element has, but I've had no such luck
[01:21:33] <Cork> by not using position fixed?
[01:22:00] <Cork> dylan9o4_: do you have an example of the problem you're talking about?
[01:22:20] <Cork> dylan9o4_: cause overflow is normally controlled through css
[01:22:25] <Cork> even for form elements
[01:22:30] <dylan9o4_> Cork: are you in chrome
[01:22:47] <Cork> yes, and no
[01:23:09] <Cork> not that i see what that matters
[01:23:24] <Daniel1809> I removed the position fixed entry, http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/8/
[01:24:33] <Daniel1809> the main problem is that the form after the submission is still not hidden in the main document...
[01:25:07] <coldhead> it's not a form you can still see afterwards
[01:25:20] <coldhead> it's a bunch of <div class="my-row">s
[01:25:29] <dylan9o4_> Cork: the max rows for chrome is 20, FF is 6, so there is a HUGE difference, the issue comes with chrome though, although I would like to have it be around 10-15 rows in all browsers if possible. but if you run this in chrome and your screen height is 768, click the 2nd input, then press the down arrow. nothing happens. It is because there is no room to display the datalist... http://jsbin.com/igarek/2/edit
[01:25:32] <coldhead> i think you want $('.my-row').hide()
[01:27:31] <Daniel1809> now it is working, thanks so far!!
[01:28:09] <coldhead> great work Daniel1809
[01:28:16] <coldhead> proud of you
[01:29:14] <Daniel1809> seriously?
[01:30:42] <coldhead> true story
[01:30:45] <Cork> dylan9o4_: hmm, ya it actually looks like there isn't an option for it :/
[01:30:48] <Daniel1809> thanks! :)
[01:30:57] <Daniel1809> another question: how can integrate the "@" character in the list in the main document? I know that &#64; is the code for it....... it is surely like a stupid question again...  ;D
[01:31:03] <banttu> At this point I thoroughly have ZERO love for TableTools.
[01:32:15] <dylan9o4_> Cork: yes that's why I found myself looking at this widget that I don't really want, but can it be done even when using that?
[01:32:52] <dylan9o4_> Cork: there's definitely more functionality with it, just not sure if that's part of it..
[01:33:31] <Cork> dylan9o4_: it can be done as long as it is normal html elements
[01:33:44] <Cork> the browser generated datalist dropdown though is another matter
[01:35:13] <dylan9o4_> Cork: so is it not even possible?
[01:35:29] <Cork> dylan9o4_: no
[01:35:34] <Kingsy_> so guys --> http://jsfiddle.net/6wdBP/ <-- simple example, first, why is the delay not registering? and second, how do you get it to fade in rather than out?
[01:35:44] <Cork> you can't style the datalist, as it isn't the real element used
[01:35:52] <Cork> the datalist is just a tag holding the data
[01:35:54] <Kingsy_> oh weird
[01:36:03] <Kingsy_> the fadeIn works on the jsfiddle..
[01:36:20] <Kingsy_> I wonder why the delay doesnt register
[01:37:16] <Cork> not even sure i want to know what you plan to use that for...
[01:37:46] <Kingsy_> yeah its pretty dumb tbh
[01:38:27] <Cork> why are delaying with a time based on the index?
[01:38:59] <Kingsy_> yeah that doesnt need to be there.
[01:39:05] <Kingsy_> but the delay still doesnt work
[01:39:24] <Kingsy_> Cork: basically the idea is to have all of a perticular element fade in on page load from white
[01:39:28] <Cork> you know that each is sync while delay and fade is async right?
[01:39:48] <Cork> then why not just do fadeIn() on all if them?
[01:39:57] <Cork> $('*').fadeIn(200);
[01:40:15] <Cork> in other words why the loop?
[01:40:24] <Kingsy_> it didnt seem to work, umm the fade wasnt smooth
[01:40:38] <Cork> ya, but the each loop wont help you there
[01:40:49] <Cork> it's cause you're doing animation in js
[01:41:32] <Kingsy_> well it did seem to help becuase it was doing one by one and not all of them together
[01:41:36] <Kingsy_> I assume thats less work?
[01:41:59] <Cork> they would all go at the same time
[01:42:09] <Cork> unless you do the delay(incremental time)
[01:42:28] <Kingsy_> that was the reason for the *index
[01:42:57] <Cork> why not just do the animation with css instead?
[01:43:05] <Cork> and leave older browser without it
[01:43:26] <Cork> it's not really a mandatory part of the page or anything
[01:43:35] <Kingsy_> thats a really good idea
[01:52:29] <farmer-duck> hi y'all
[01:52:45] <farmer-duck> sorry wrong chann
[01:54:28] <coldhead> :(
[01:54:53] <coldhead> SPEAKING WORDS TO THE BLIND
[02:13:33] <natrixnatrix89> I have the following problem with jquery sortable:
[02:13:33] <natrixnatrix89> I have a container of elements with overflow-x: scroll. It contains sortable items (display: block) and (width > containers width).
[02:13:34] <natrixnatrix89> If the container is scrolled to the left edge, there is no problem in sorting.
[02:13:34] <natrixnatrix89> But if it is scrolled to the right, then when I start dragging, the sortable element jumps to the right. And as a result the element is far to the right.. but mouse is far to the left of the element while dragging..
[02:13:34] <natrixnatrix89> It looks like jqueryui fails to get the initial offset of the element correctly because the parent is scrolled.
[02:13:34] <natrixnatrix89> But the interesting part is that this happens only on the initial drag.. When I try to drag the second time, it is positioned correctly. And again.. when I reload the page it sets wrong position on first drag..
[02:13:34] <natrixnatrix89> Here's the problem shown in a video: http://youtu.be/h1mBLAmYtgk
[02:14:58] <natrixnatrix89> I've been fighting with this quite a time. But have no idea how to fix it..
[02:15:06] <natrixnatrix89> It must be a bug in jquery UI sortable..
[02:15:36] <coldhead> damn those jquery bug authors!
[02:29:57] <MindSpark> hi, can someone recommend an idiots guide to deferred?

[02:44:04] <Coltaine> Hi can anybody help me out with this. when I make such a function: $('#myId').on('load keypress change',function(){/*stuff*/}    the function only work on keypress and change but is not executed when the elemt is loaded.
[02:44:40] <Cork> ColKurtz: load only works on elements that loads a resource
[02:45:02] <Cork> like body, img, iframe, script, object and so on
[02:45:20] <Coltaine> ok. is there any other way to execute this function when this element is loaded?
[02:45:50] <Cork> what do you mean "loaded"?
[02:46:17] <Coltaine> when the document is ready in fact
[02:46:39] <Cork> use a named function and call it from the .ready handler
[02:47:18] <Coltaine> Ahhh. stupid me. yes this is the best solution. didn't think of it. thank you

[03:15:09] <diverdude> I have in my serverscripts divided my page into logical areas which i call elements.  Like a bunch a signupform is an element or a searchform or searchresults or similar. I need to update a part of my site, which is basically such an element...A signup form. I considered to do async call and render the element as html, serialize it and have js create the element. Would that by rape of async calls?
[03:15:11] <carloratm> Is it possible to trigger the File Choose Dialog showing in Jquery ?
[03:16:16] <diverdude> by=be
[03:17:01] <Cork> carloratm: $('input[type="file"]').click()
[03:17:48] <carloratm> tried, It is not working...
[03:18:01] <diverdude> i mean...when is it to much for async call? when is a page refresh needed?
[03:18:26] <Cork> diverdude: never?
[03:18:50] <Cork> well it is needed when you want to kill of all running javascripts in the page
[03:19:29] <diverdude> Cork, so its not abuse to make entire webportal using async and never make a page refresh
[03:19:48] <Cork> diverdude: "use async"
[03:19:53] <Cork> you mean use ajax?
[03:20:10] <Cork> async is a way code flows, not a way to update a page
[03:21:27] <carloratm> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/2V4Lp/
[03:22:26] <Daniel1809> Cork: May you have an idea how I can have the "@" character in my email address in the list in the main document? http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/11/
[03:22:39] <Daniel1809> *Maybe
[03:23:35] <Cork> carloratm: http://jsfiddle.net/2V4Lp/1/
[03:23:45] <Cork> carloratm: you can only trigger it from a user action
[03:23:49] <Cork> not statically
[03:24:22] <carloratm> ahhhhhh, I'd love to open the dialog when page loads
[03:24:47] <Cork> so would naggers
[03:24:56] <Cork> and thats why it's blocked
[03:25:45] <Cork> dan2k3k4_: what do you mean?
[03:25:56] <Cork> opps
[03:25:59] <Cork> *Daniel1809:
[03:25:59] <dan2k3k4_> :o
[03:26:03] <Cork> sorry
[03:27:05] <diverdude> Cork, ajax is an async call
[03:27:24] <Cork> diverdude: yes but an async action isn't always an ajax call
[03:27:35] <Daniel1809> Cork: when you are submitting my form, then the values of the submitted fields are listed in the main document. and as you can see the email address does not include the "@" character there... how to fix that?
[03:28:07] <diverdude> Cork, true. i was talking in regard to async call to webserver...i figured that was pretty clear from the context :)
[03:28:28] <Cork> diverdude: call it what it is "ajax"
[03:28:37] <mh___> hi.. i load some <input type="radio" class="radio-btn" /> element from a ajax request.. i have added a method when the document is ready $('.radio-btn').on('change', function().. but i load my ajax after the document is ready.. so its like the listener does not listen to new created classes.. can i listen to new created classes?
[03:28:43] <Cork> async is not in anyway related to ajax
[03:29:44] <diverdude> Cork, but i was not wrong in saying async. I could also have said ajax. Might have been more clear - i give you that
[03:30:20] <Cork> diverdude: you could have said if it was ok to update it with strings, that wouln't have been less correct
[03:30:44] <Cork> diverdude: async is how code flows; the recommended way for ajax call to execute is async
[03:30:53] <Cork> it doesn't mean ajax in anyway means async
[03:30:57] <Cork> or that async means ajax
[03:32:13] <Cork> diverdude: is about as pointing at the monitor and call it the computer
[03:32:21] <Cork> *as correct as pointing
[03:32:22] <jds_> Heya
[03:32:31] <Cork> you know what the other party means, but it isn't the computer
[03:32:56] <jds_> I'm migrating a bunch of old code from attr -> prop.  I'm struggling to think of instances when you'd really want 'attr' - any suggestions?
[03:33:28] <Cork> jds_: when you want to read the original attribute value from the element
[03:33:31] <dalnet22> is prop new?
[03:33:37] <Cork> not really
[03:33:53] <Cork> it was introduced in 1.5 if i remember correctly
[03:33:54] <jds_> dalnet22: Relatively.  Jquery 1.6, I think?
[03:33:58] <jds_> Oh, maybe
[03:33:59] <dalnet22> ok
[03:34:21] <Cork> well actually attr was split into prop and attr
[03:34:26] <Cork> before attr tried to do both
[03:34:33] <Cork> (and caused bugs cause of it)
[03:34:49] <Cork> jds_: you're correct it was 1.6
[03:34:57] <jds_> Cork: Yeah, the 'reading the original attribute' seems to be the canonical description of when to use attr, but I can't think of instances when you'd actually want thta.
[03:35:30] <dwarder_> ajax loads a content into div, this content has ids on wich events are binded ( .click) how to i "reload" this "bindings"
[03:35:35] <Cork> jds_: $($('a').attr('href')).scrollTo(); for example
[03:35:38] <shoky> jds_: when reading a src or href
[03:36:11] <Cork> jds_: prop would have to do something like $('#' + $('a').prop('href').split('#')[1]).scrollTo(); for example
[03:36:18] <shoky> also, mornin'
[03:36:40] <dwarder_> so that this click event are fired?
[03:36:53] <Cork> jds_: <a href="#some-id"></a> as prop('href') is http://www.example.com/path/file.html#some-id
[03:37:12] <Cork> jds_: while <a href="#some-id"></a> as attr('href') is #some-id
[03:37:41] <jds_> dwarder_: You might try doing it with 'on' - $("#mycontentdiv").on('click', '.clickable-thing', function(){...})
[03:38:06] <jds_> dwarder_: (Assuming that #mycontentdiv is a permanent fixture on the page)
[03:38:22] <Daniel1809> when you are submitting my form, then the values of the submitted fields are listed in the main document. and as you can see the email address does not include the "@" character there... how to fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/ZCVCL/11/
[03:38:28] <dwarder_> jds_: .click is just a shorthand for .on(click
[03:38:28] <Cork> ya, delegate is prob what you want
[03:38:38] <dwarder_> jds_: so, what is the diff?
[03:38:41] <jds_> Cork: Mm, ok.  So attr is only useful when you want the original string value of the html
[03:38:49] <Cork> dwarder_: delegate see the second argument to on
[03:39:03] <Cork> jds_: yes
[03:39:13] <Cork> jds_: though that isn't "only" though :)
[03:39:32] <jds_> dwarder_: My version binds a click event to the #mycontentdiv element, then sees if the click target matches '.clickable-thing', then calls your event handler
[03:39:40] <Cork> jds_: but ya that is what the function name says attr => getAttribute, prop => getProperty
[03:40:26] <Cork> another one >_>
[03:40:26] <jds_> dwarder_: Otherwise (with $('.clickable-thing').click(...)), you're binding the click event to the .clickable-thing element, which then disappears after your ajax call
[03:40:59] <Cork> well you bind the hander explicitly to the element that matches the selector
[03:41:06] <Cork> so when the element is replaced, the handler goes away
[03:44:47] <mogaj> this is working in jsfiddle but not in my project http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/TXmg6/5/
[03:45:43] <Cork> mogaj: 1. live is dead, don't use it
[03:45:43] <Cork> use .delegate or .on instead
[03:45:44] <Cork> and you most likely forgot to wrap the code in ready
[03:46:11] <amcsi_work> hi
[03:46:13] <dwarder_> jds_: so i have and <div id='id1'>test</div> that reappeared after my ajax, in order for this to be fired on click in my <script> i added this $('#id1').on('click',alert('omg i clicked'); in hope that it will work
[03:46:26] <dwarder_> jds_: so i have <div id='id1'>test</div> that reappeared after my ajax, in order for this to be fired on click in my <script> i added this $('#id1').on('click',alert('omg i clicked'); in hope that it will work
[03:46:28] <amcsi_work> how do I test if an element has at least 1 element child?
[03:46:41] <amcsi_work> without having to actually select all the children
[03:46:46] <dwarder_> jds_: have i missed something?
[03:46:55] <Cork> ?:empty @ amcsi_work
[03:46:56] <bot-t> amcsi_work, :empty: Select all elements that have no children (including text nodes). http://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[03:47:19] <Cork> dwarder_: yes, you missed the delegation part
[03:47:25] <Cork> ?.delegate @ dwarder_
[03:47:26] <bot-t> dwarder_, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:47:33] <Cork> read about how delegation works
[03:47:41] <Cork> (on has a syntax for it)
[03:48:17] <amcsi_work> text nodes don't count as children
[03:48:21] <amcsi_work> I meant elements
[03:49:15] <xec_> amcsi_work: but :empty will count text nodes...
[03:49:36] <Cork> amcsi_work: .filter(function(elm) { return $(elm).children().length == 0; }); then
[03:49:50] <Cork> xec: i think that was the point
[03:49:54] <xec_> ah right
[03:54:57] <mogaj> Cork : i am trying to get confirm dialog box when submitting a ajaxform in jquery using this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jansian/wupmq/ i wrote this http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/TXmg6/8/ the code is working in jsfiddle but not in my code
[03:55:26] <Alina-malina> Hello all! can someone please help me i am trying to make a login system with jquery, but when i login with it it only gives the 1 letter of login and pass?
[03:55:42] <xec_> ?demo @ Alina-malina
[03:55:42] <b-ot> Alina-malina: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:55:42] <bot-t> Alina-malina, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:56:08] <Cork> mogaj: that is the replacement for live http://jsfiddle.net/TXmg6/9/
[03:57:10] <Cork> mogaj: and from the look of it i think you should be using .submit instead of #btn-sub
[03:57:28] <Cork> cause you should be listening for the submit event from the form not the click on the button
[03:57:33] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[03:57:54] <dwarder_> Cork: so in easy words it works like this $('#idThatIsNotUpdatedByAjax').on('click','#innerIdThatIsUpdated',function(){alert('bindings are still here)});
[03:58:08] <dwarder_> Cork: right?
[03:58:12] <Cork> dwarder_: yes
[03:58:19] <dwarder_> Cork: thank you :)
[03:58:37] <mogaj> Thank you will rectify errors
[03:58:51] <Alina-malina> http://jsfiddle.net/zVUq5/
[03:59:14] <WakiMiko> is there a way to listen for 'disabled' events? that is, an event that gets triggered when an element becomes disabled
[04:00:21] <xec_> Alina-malina: event.which is always just gonna be the key pressed (1 letter)
[04:00:40] <xec_> Alina-malina: if you want to send the value of the input, try "this.value" instead
[04:00:40] <Alina-malina> xec, oh, then whan i have to use then?
[04:01:09] <Alina-malina> xec_, .this.value(function(event)   like this?
[04:01:14] <sacho> WakiMiko, there's no such event - some browser tools will let you break code execution on attribute changes of an element and such(for debugging)
[04:01:31] <xec_> Alina-malina: is this copypasta or did you write the script yourself?
[04:02:02] <Alina-malina> xec_, i dont rememmber i have this very old script, so i want to fix it to use with phpcodeigniter framework
[04:02:44] <WakiMiko> sacho: ok, thanks
[04:03:45] <xec_> Alina-malina: well, i don't know what the login.php expects as input, so i can't tell you what the "right thing to do" is. what i do know is what i told you. event.which is one letter, and this.value (assuming it is a text input) will be the value of the input
[04:04:41] <xec_> Alina-malina: i also know that sending an ajax request on each keypress is also a bad idea, you probably want to throttle it; http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[04:05:17] <Alina-malina> xec_, oh ok, i will look at throttle, here is a small script in login php that is waiting on the server: http://pastebin.com/q10FTB2S
[04:05:34] <xec_> Alina-malina: (actually, event.which isn't a letter, it is the keykode of the key you pressed)
[04:06:14] <Alina-malina> xec_, i just write it so it take the get request and put into file, but i just nogice it only letter by letter
[04:06:26] <Alina-malina> *notice
[04:06:47] <xec_> Alina-malina: looks more like a keylogger to me
[04:08:36] <Alina-malina> xec_, oh i see, not a keylogger, just an old script i am not good at jquery, so this script was in my file archive, i thought to try it, what i suppose to do then? how i can make the login script to take the whole login and pass?
[04:08:56] * xec_ starts to cry
[04:11:33] <sacho> you're supposed to get better at jquery and ask specific questions when you have a problem
[04:25:06] <jlebrech> why does the handle not work for sortable http://jsfiddle.net/pVCZ7/1/

[04:58:03] <lemonsparrow> how can I remove the hardcoded name and value parameters from the plugin and give values iterating the products array of object ? http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/yuPV3/
[04:58:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hi
[04:59:39] <shoky> Daniel1809: it includes the character but it's escaped because .serialize() URL-encodes special characters for posting the form to the server
[05:00:20] <shoky> encoded, not escaped
[05:03:45] <shoky> Daniel1809: if you want to decode it, you can use decodeURIComponent(...)
[05:05:03] <shoky> Daniel1809:  btw you can use .serializeArray() instead of that split you're doing
[05:05:17] <shoky> Daniel1809: and that will have non-encoded values
[05:06:53] <lemonsparrow> how can I remove the hardcoded name and value parameters from the plugin and give values iterating the products array of object ? http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/yuPV3/ shoky any idea?

[05:07:35] <bel3atar> shoky: do I have to json_encode the array for php to be able to parse it?
[05:08:55] <shoky> bel3atar: you can't send an array .. you have to serialize it somehow. sure, json_encode is one way
[05:11:11] <shoky> lemonsparrow: you can use $.each or $.map for that.  btw, you need to put the code that accesses "products" inside the loadAllProducts callback
[05:11:19] <lemonsparrow> any help to my doubt will be highly appreciated... thanks

[05:35:22] <arthurmaciel> good evening!
[05:35:50] <arthurmaciel> is it possible to authenticate the user when using .ajax?
[05:36:01] <arthurmaciel> I'm new to all this and it seems a bit confusing to me.
[05:37:50] <lemonsparrow> ?
[05:38:18] <arthurmaciel> lemonsparrow: is that to me?
[05:38:45] <lemonsparrow> arthurmaciel: no just was checking if I am still inside the channel and not logged out :)
[05:38:51] <arthurmaciel> :)
[05:39:02] <xec_> we read you loud and clear. over.
[05:40:32] <xec_> arthurmaciel: if the browser has authenticated to some page, .ajax() calls (to the same domain) should be authenticated too, if that's what you're asking
[05:40:37] <lemonsparrow> I get obj is null for this code http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/yuPV3/2/
[05:41:13] <arthurmaciel> xec_: to delete some item ajax will access some url. But removing an item requires user authentication. On the page accessed by ajax I should do an authentication check (using sessions, cookies or anything else)?
[05:41:26] <xec_> lemonsparrow: i get DWR is not defined
[05:41:52] <lemonsparrow> xec_: well thats DWR call I make to the server...
[05:42:21] <xec_> arthurmaciel: was that a statement or a question?
[05:42:25] <arthurmaciel> xec_: and if the user is not authenticated the response could be "User not authenticated.e Click here to sign in" ?
[05:42:40] <lemonsparrow> xec_: and DWR.loadAllProducts(function(data) is supposed to return list of objects
[05:42:47] <arthurmaciel> xec_: both :) (sorry for my english limitations)
[05:42:54] <xec_> arthurmaciel: yes, this would all be server-side logic
[05:43:15] <arthurmaciel> xec_: is it advisable to have server- AND client-side logic for authentication?
[05:43:56] <xec_> arthurmaciel: well, both can be best for UX, but server-side is mandatory (for any sort of security)
[05:44:54] <arthurmaciel> xec_: I'm asking all this because I'll try to use www.labs.mimmin.com/inlineedit/ and it seems to me that the urls need to do their specific task and there's no space for an authentication request.
[05:47:19] <xec_> arthurmaciel: well, this doesn't do anything as far as authentication goes, you'll have to implement this on the side on your own in addition
[05:48:42] <arthurmaciel> xec_: the point is that .ajax can do any POST request, but if I don't authenticate on server-side someone else using an http client could make this POST request and mess with my system, right?
[05:49:01] <xec_> arthurmaciel: yes. correct. you need authentication implemented server-side
[05:49:08] <arthurmaciel> xec_: thank you!
[05:56:04] <Daniel1809> thank you very much, shoky!

[07:24:04] <microhxo> Guys, I am having a little bit of trouble with the  .Click command
[07:24:50] <microhxo> http://pastebin.com/sQnRggu6   This goes through and clicks all the radio buttons for me, however only one of the radio buttons onclick = gets executed..
[07:24:55] <bob-98274> Coltaine: You spelled "length" wrong?
[07:25:42] <microhxo> when i manually initialize a click using the console it also activates the onclicked event but on document ready in a .each it doesnt do it. Any explanation?
[07:27:32] <microhxo> .onclick();
[07:27:36] <microhxo> i will try that
[07:29:21] <Mizar-jp__> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jqm-page-params-plugin-fails-on-jquery-mobile-1-3   this is similar to the problems that I encountered.
[07:31:03] <Coltaine> ah. damn thank you bob

[07:34:12] <microhxo> Dammit
[07:34:36] <microhxo> the jquery .click event for a radio button when used in a .each DOES NOT fire the radio buttons onclick event.......
[07:34:39] <microhxo> How can i fix this???
[07:37:52] <bob-98274> MickRip_: you sure the onclick event has been set up BEFORE you call .click?
[07:39:10] <microhxo> Im calling the .click inside of document ready
[07:39:14] <microhxo> so it should be setup.
[07:42:16] <bob-98274> MickRip_: I should have said the onclick event handler.  You are using the onclick attribute on the html element?
[07:44:30] <microhxo> yes, i am using onclick attribute
[07:44:32] <bob-98274> can't you just do $(this).click(); ?
[07:44:56] <microhxo> When i do that inside of the .each, it clicks the radio button but the onclick attribute never fires.
[07:45:00] <microhxo> if i do it via the console
[07:45:02] <microhxo> it works fine
[07:45:46] <bob-98274> you might need to post your html.
[07:47:44] <banister`shop> where should i put the images for a jquery plugin?
[07:47:52] <banister`shop> this one for example: https://github.com/laurie71/jquery-toaster/tree/master/images
[07:53:29] <c4ptnh00k> banister`shop: Just look in the css for what directory its looking for the image in.
[07:53:42] <banister`shop> c4ptnh00k: ./images/foo.jpg
[07:54:34] <c4ptnh00k> banister`shop: So what's your question?
[07:55:28] <banister`shop> c4ptnh00k: well i'm happy to modify the CSS image lookup path if it's undiomatic, my question is really which is the best place to put the images for a jquery plugin -- if the plugin im using is doing it wrong (which it could be) im happy to change it
[07:57:23] <c4ptnh00k> banister`shop: Well idealistically you would have your images in a folder parallel to the source it's used in. ie. blahblah/images  and blahblah/source
[07:58:25] <banister`shop> c4ptnh00k: thx
[07:58:54] <c4ptnh00k> banister`shop: But Jquery doesn't know where you put stuff. So you just have to modify the path to your folder
[07:59:02] <c4ptnh00k> banister`shop: NP

[08:08:04] <codeshah> whats the best way to cache this data, so jQuery does not keep getting that external data
[08:09:56] <krusty_ar> codeshah: that should probably be handled by the http layer (cache times, etc.) but you could store it on localstorage
[08:12:07] <Bloomberg> Someone could help me
[08:12:08] <Bloomberg> pl
[08:12:10] <Bloomberg> plz

[08:28:47] <hatoon> please
[08:29:13] <Saaether> hatoon could you please elaberate? your question didnt really make any sense
[08:31:35] <Bloomberg> I have a problem with fancybox modal window plugin!!
[08:32:02] <Bloomberg> The problem is that I'm getting the content dynamically with ajax
[08:32:35] <hatoon> will improve the question ok
[08:33:03] <Bloomberg> If I open the window for first time, all going ok. but if I close this window and without reload page  try to open again the window show me .fancybox is not a function
[08:33:51] <hatoon> how to get always the newest version of jquery understands the link, because it is the old site, if there is a way to get the current link understood
[08:35:19] <Saaether> sorry hatoon still dont follow
[08:36:24] <clov3r> hatoon... you want to link to the latest version of jquery, whatever the latest version may be?
[08:37:05] <hatoon> not yet understood?
[08:37:09] <clov3r> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/441412/is-there-a-link-to-the-latest-jquery-library-on-google-apis
[08:37:13] <clov3r> hatoon ^

[08:37:43] <hatoon> yes
[08:37:47] <clov3r> what's your native language?
[08:37:50] <hatoon> is how ?
[08:37:56] <CreativeNotice_> hatoon: this will always load the latest version. //code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[08:38:33] <_rgn> linking to latest jquery isn't necessarily a good idea
[08:39:58] <CreativeNotice_> Agreed _rgn

[09:00:44] <Danny1809> Hey guys, why the password pattern is not working here? http://jsfiddle.net/85xpR/2/
[09:02:53] <c4ptnh00k> Danny1809:What is it not doing?
[09:03:58] <Danny1809> c4ptnh00k: you can type any password you want... and it will be okay... but check the password pattern in the code
[09:05:00] <c4ptnh00k> Danny1809: ah I see so its not applying the regex
[09:05:13] <Danny1809> true
[09:06:37] <scroat> moin.
[09:06:52] <scroat> is it possible to have the return be a file via ? $.ajax
[09:07:08] <c4ptnh00k> scroat: yes
[09:07:26] <warden23> Hello, to be honest I don't know where to start but would GREATLY appreciate some help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/tK2ZR/ Basically I want it so if #menu-bar doesn't have .node (another div with a class inside the #menu-bar div) then it'll hide the #random-div that has the word "hello" in it. Obviously .node isn't in the example so you should understand what I mean? :D
[09:08:03] <scroat> c4ptnh00k: can you show me a link with out needing to import any third party libraries ?
[09:08:22] <scroat> it has to be a post
[09:08:52] <c4ptnh00k> Danny1809: Your expression is fine. THe proplem is in your test function. and Im not sure exactly how that is getting rigged up
[09:08:59] <shoky> warden23: ID's need to be unique, first of all
[09:09:06] <scroat> I want to be able to post some json to the server and have the response be a file.
[09:09:15] <ngharo> Danny1809: because checkPassword is called only if password.length < 1
[09:09:18] <warden23> Yes they do but I'm stuck with something I'm working with that doesn't have them.
[09:09:41] <shoky> warden23: then why make a fiddle with something you know is wrong and isn't what you're working with
[09:09:42] <warden23> So I have to do this by calling the specific words within the same id div's, if that makes sense?
[09:10:00] <warden23> Because it is what I'm working with, I just don't know the jquery side of it.
[09:10:25] <shoky> you said what you're working with doesn't have repeated ID's  o.O
[09:10:35] <warden23> sorry mean't 'does'
[09:10:38] <ngharo> Danny1809: http://jsfiddle.net/85xpR/3/
[09:10:48] <shoky> warden23: then that something is wrong and needs to be fixed, it's invalid
[09:10:48] <warden23> sorry been at it for awhile I'm getting brain fog
[09:11:04] <c4ptnh00k> scroat:are you trying to download a file or just display something like a pdf?
[09:11:17] <drasko_> hi all. I have a group of buttons, and I want to call a function if any of these buttons are clicked. What is the best way to do it ?
[09:12:30] <warden23> Basically I need something like: if in #menu-bar there is no .node then display: none to the #random-div that contains the text hello
[09:12:36] <shoky> warden23: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tK2ZR/1/
[09:12:38] <warden23> I know it can be done, I just don't know the code.
[09:12:57] <warden23> Champion :)
[09:13:10] <scroat> c4ptnh00k: I want to download a file.
[09:13:28] <warden23> I have to work with something a client has already coded so I can't change the repeating div names, hence why I'm looking at jquery
[09:13:50] <c4ptnh00k> drasko_: set a variable as a toggle ie.(var foo = false;) and just register a click even on each button to change that var to true then check if(foo){ do stuff }
[09:14:16] <shoky> warden23:  you can do..  $('[id=random-div]:contains(hello)').hide()   but thats really inefficient and scans each and every element in your DOM
[09:14:22] <Danny1809> ngharo, thank you!
[09:14:24] <warden23> Thanks again shoky :)
[09:14:25] <c4ptnh00k> scroat: you can not download a file with ajax. The Browser will not allow this.
[09:14:44] <warden23> so your way is the best way?
[09:14:51] <warden23> The jsfiddle one
[09:15:07] <shoky> warden23: yea pretty much
[09:15:10] <warden23> sweet
[09:15:35] <drasko_> c4ptnh00k, and how can I reference a group of buttons ?
[09:15:37] <scroat> c4ptnh00k: oh ok.
[09:15:59] <c4ptnh00k> drasko_: with a selector
[09:16:18] <drasko_> c4ptnh00k, there is many buttons, I can not give every button unique ID
[09:16:47] <drasko_> can I group them somehow and call them by referencing the group ?
[09:17:16] <warden23> shoky : is it possible to make it .node or .disabled so it checks both are missing and then does what you have?
[09:17:25] <c4ptnh00k> drasko_: so give them a class then loop ie foreach button with class = foo ... yadda yadda
[09:17:34] <drasko_> ok, thanks !
[09:17:35] <warden23> .node and .disabled rather
[09:17:36] <shoky> warden23:  &&  is for  AND
[09:17:51] <shoky> warden23:  if (condition_a && condition_b)
[09:17:58] <warden23> '.node && .disabled'
[09:18:02] <shoky> no.
[09:18:11] <shoky> .node  is not a condition
[09:18:38] <warden23> if ( $('#menu-bar').has('.node' && '.disabled').length === 0 )
[09:19:00] <shoky> no
[09:19:01] <c4ptnh00k> drasko_: No prob ;)
[09:19:03] <warden23> lol
[09:19:05] <warden23> :(
[09:19:22] <shoky> warden23: you can do this too  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tK2ZR/2/
[09:19:58] <warden23> Ah, gotchya, thanks!
[09:20:05] <Bloomberg> shoky: has you worked with fancybox?
[09:20:10] <shoky> Bloomberg: no
[09:22:30] <Bloomberg> shoky: i need that resize it when there are new content inside!!
[09:23:17] <shoky> Bloomberg: i need a good massage
[09:23:19] <shoky> !!
[09:23:39] <c4ptnh00k> lol
[09:23:46] <Bloomberg> What?
[09:23:54] <shoky> or a good cheeseburger
[09:23:58] <hugo_moss> (he wants a happy ending)
[09:24:20] <Saaether> Bloomberg $.fancybox.update()
[09:24:26] <c4ptnh00k> shoky apparently is now a hungry perv
[09:24:38] <shoky> let it be known
[09:25:00] <Bloomberg> Saaether: I already made it, but doesn't works
[09:26:49] <c4ptnh00k> Anyone have any opinions on KnockoutJs? Thinking about going with it to mock up my blog page, but not sure if all that templating is overkill
[09:28:00] <iatkotep> I have an interesting problem I'm hoping someone can help me with
[09:28:16] <iatkotep> I have a heirarchy of containers, all with the same class "row"
[09:28:33] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: i use it and <3 it
[09:28:47] <warden23> shoky: is there a better way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/tK2ZR/3/
[09:28:55] <iatkotep> I'd like to be able to identify each tier, and mark the last item with a "last-child" class
[09:29:06] <chilversc_> any documents out there on the volatility of localstorage in different browsers?
[09:29:15] <warden23> Doing multiple ones, etc.
[09:29:20] <iatkotep> something like this: http://pastebin.com/QhS2LzAA
[09:29:41] <c4ptnh00k> shoky: does it save dev time or cost it? I know theoretically templating should save you time, but if it takes more time to write the template then ur not gaining.
[09:30:03] <momomomomo> iatkotep: http://api.jquery.com/children/ and http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[09:30:26] <momomomomo> iatkotep: http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[09:30:52] <iatkotep> momomomomo, I'm using both those methods exactly. I must be using the children() method wrong.
[09:31:04] <iatkotep> I'll take a look.
[09:31:08] <iatkotep> thakns
[09:31:34] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: it definitely saves time after you've learned it and have some experience with it. at first it can take a bit of time to get used to it, but that's true for most anything
[09:32:15] <Bloomberg> how can I set if one radio input is selected is not possible anothers radio inputs selected
[09:32:16] <Bloomberg> ?
[09:32:40] <momomomomo> Bloomberg: paste your code to jsfiddle.net
[09:32:42] <shoky> Bloomberg: give them the same name
[09:33:13] <c4ptnh00k> shoky: fair enough
[09:33:32] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/erodev/1/edit
[09:35:19] <cusco> hi folks
[09:35:36] <warden23> hello
[09:35:37] <cusco> I have a form and am using: $('form[name=loginForm]').submit(function(){
[09:35:37] <momomomomo> Bloomberg: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3642993/jquery-on-checked-toggle-box
[09:35:47] <cusco> console.log($(this).serialize()); returns what is expected
[09:35:53] <cusco> except the new element I just added
[09:35:55] <cusco> a input type checkbox
[09:35:57] <cusco> ...
[09:35:58] <momomomomo> iatkotep: seems like you might want to do a $('row').each or something
[09:36:01] <cusco> can't figure out why
[09:36:46] <iatkotep> momomomo: yeah, I've messed with that too.  It's a surprisingly tricky problem.  Thanks for the suggestion
[09:37:13] <momomomomo> iatkotep: paste yoru code to a jsfiddle or jsbin
[09:40:12] <momomomomo> I feel like spoon feeding - iatkotep $('div').each(function() { $(this).children('div').last().addClass('hello'); });
[09:41:11] <iatkotep> momomomo: that was my code exactly, and I just figured out why it's not working.  There are columns inbetween the nested rows.  children returns nothing because it looks one level down, and sees only columns.
[09:41:57] <iatkotep> momomomomo: so I'm thinking I need to use find() instead of children().  But that gives me everything...
[09:43:01] <momomomomo> iatkotep: I think you're doing something differently - please paste your code.
[09:43:56] <jedimind> momo! mo, momo, mo?
[09:44:28] <iatkotep> momomomomo: http://pastebin.com/aYuuFraV
[09:44:43] <jedimind> why would you do that ?
[09:44:49] <jedimind> just use selectivizr
[09:44:53] <momomomomo> iatkotep: to jsfiddle or other so that I can see your html.
[09:45:04] <jedimind> if you need backwards compatibility with older browsers and new css selectors
[09:45:12] <Bloomberg> momomomomo: This is good but {isn't what I need
[09:45:22] <jedimind> iatkotep ^
[09:46:18] <Bloomberg> I have two radio inputs, I need to restrict the selection of both radio inputs, if the first radio input is selected the second radio cannot to be selected
[09:46:35] <jedimind> Bloomberg thats what radio buttons do by default...
[09:46:39] <jedimind> just use html
[09:46:48] <jedimind> give them the same name, and it does that by default
[09:47:18] <momomomomo> I've not used selectivizr - jedimind, is it bueno?
[09:48:07] <jedimind> Bloomberg http://jsfiddle.net/maMuc/
[09:48:13] <jedimind> momomomomo yeah its pretty magical
[09:48:29] <jedimind> it uses your js library of choice to leverage its selector engine to give you transparent fallback to older browsers
[09:48:40] <warden23> Hey, does anyone know how to stop contains(Shop) stop hiding Shopping? As I have Shop and Shopping and I only want Shop hidden, but obviously Shop is within Shopping lol? http://jsfiddle.net/tK2ZR/4/
[09:48:42] <iatkotep> jedimind: that's awesome
[09:48:44] <jedimind> so you write your css as if it was for good browsers, and it uses js polyfills to pass it back
[09:49:30] <momomomomo> jedimind: then what JS would you recommend to iatkotep, which is different?
[09:49:43] <jedimind> i wouldnt
[09:49:53] <jedimind> i would recommend he just includes selectivizr, and then he doesnt need to do it with javascript
[09:49:56] <jedimind> and can just do it with css selectors
[09:50:18] <momomomomo> ah, yes I see - that would be the best route
[09:50:32] <warden23> nvm just worked it out I put .show() on Shopping :)
[09:54:49] <JFranks> Ouch.. what changed (in Chrome?) http://jsfiddle.net/Pb5Xv/  .. that blue X is not so good.. Looks like I officially have to abandon HTML5 for jQuery? (I just restarted Chrome after at least a week of running the same version)
[09:55:40] <BillCriswell> JFranks: That's a weird question. Your issue should be easily solvable with some CSS.
[09:55:44] <cusco> hi
[09:55:48] <cusco> http://jsfiddle.net/NdNa4/
[09:56:00] <cusco> why isn'0t the checkbox returning in serialize ?
[09:56:26] <BillCriswell> cusco: If it's not checked it won't show up.
[09:56:41] <cusco> BillCriswell: I checkd it
[09:56:50] <cusco> or...
[09:57:11] <cusco> so when I click on it
[09:57:16] <cusco> its not being checked ?
[09:57:54] <cusco> gah !
[09:58:02] <cusco> what am I missing to make it checked =?
[09:58:44] <c4ptnh00k> $('selector').prop('checked',true);
[09:58:58] <c4ptnh00k> to check it
[09:59:05] <cusco> shouldn't it be native
[09:59:07] <cusco> to browser
[09:59:09] <cusco> on click
[09:59:10] <cusco> check ?
[09:59:19] <BillCriswell> cusco: It needs a name as well.
[09:59:26] <cusco> true.dat
[09:59:45] <BillCriswell> cusco: http://jsfiddle.net/NdNa4/1/
[10:00:11] <cusco> BillCriswell: that was it
[10:00:12] <cusco> thanks
[10:00:14] <cusco> !
[10:00:19] <cusco> (I over looked it)
[10:00:26] <BillCriswell> Happens.
[10:00:42] <c4ptnh00k> like the name lol
[10:00:53] <BillCriswell> I've been on a kick with that word lately.
[10:01:03] <BillCriswell> Just find it hilarious lately.
[10:01:20] <c4ptnh00k> oh i rofld
[10:01:58] <c4ptnh00k> just hope he doesnt copy paste into production
[10:02:21] <c4ptnh00k> or maybe I do
[10:02:21] <BillCriswell> My girlfriend got her wisdom teeth out recently and coming off the gas she grabs my chest and shakes them and yells "titties!", pretty hilarious
[10:02:28] <Saaether_> freaking netsplits keep crashing my client for some reason
[10:02:36] <cusco> now another question, it sends name=on on chrome, does this vary from browser to browser? I seem to recall firefox using 0 and 1
[10:02:43] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: You could always sneak a titty in.
[10:02:48] <cusco> serialize always sets it to 'on' ?
[10:03:19] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: people go to jail for trying to sneak in a titty lol
[10:03:37] <BillCriswell> cusco: Try it and see. =)
[10:03:51] <BillCriswell> I know it would use the value attribute if it was set, as for default I have no idea.
[10:04:12] <c4ptnh00k> cusco: 0/1 on/blank all mean the same just true or false
[10:04:48] <BillCriswell> If you're not using a value a non-empty field should is enough to know if it's checked or not.
[10:11:47] <BillCriswell> Freenode is going nuts today I think.
[10:11:56] <Saaether_> ya
[10:13:11] <dan89> hello all, I am trying to parse the options of a select tag whenever the page loads, but I can't figure out the best way to trigger my function when the drop down loads, can anyone point me in the right direction?
[10:17:27] <BillCriswell> dan89: They're loaded as soon as they're available. You can just do $('select option') as soon as it's ready.
[10:21:23] <BillCriswell> dan89: You can put the code in $(function(){ ... }); in the header or just .... before the </body>
[10:54:57] <noaXess> hi all
[10:55:10] <jedimind> howdy
[10:55:54] <noaXess> have a dialog which takes the data with a ajax request.. and if dialog is open and dialog.html() exists, i only do dial.html(newdata)...
[10:56:13] <noaXess> the data in the dialog.html is some html including javascript and uploadify...
[10:56:33] <noaXess> in ff, chrome, chromiun.. all is working fine, also on data update, while dialog leaves open...
[10:57:21] <noaXess> in IE9, it breaks on data update, it breaks with Object expected
[10:57:51] <noaXess> the problem is the uploadify script inside the data which is fetched over ajax and replaced with ,html(newdata)..
[10:58:03] <noaXess> any hint ?
[10:58:09] <noaXess> jedimind: hi
[10:59:27] <jedimind> there's too much going on there to just theorize and guess, you'll have to provide a test case
[10:59:31] <jedimind> or a url to where this is
[11:01:40] <chilversc> so I guess that's a no to documentation on different browsers'/platforms' volatility for localstorage
[11:03:00] <noaXess> jedimind: wait
[11:03:14] <jedimind> im not saying i'll be able to help you either
[11:03:25] <jedimind> its just that's how this channel operates
[11:06:48] <noaXess> i know.. but all the code is locally, so not available from world ;).. try to provide some code..
[11:08:01] <noaXess> i think the main problem is, getting html data with js code over ajax and send to dialog.html(data) while dialog is open.. and only in IE9.. cause ff and chrome are working perfect, w/o any errors..
[11:08:15] <noaXess> some string in the data i get over ajax cause a problem in IE9.. don't know why.
[11:10:11] <Danny1809> Hey, guys! Why is my overlay / form not working? It is because of the email regex, but why?? http://jsfiddle.net/jqTQj/
[11:10:31] <Danny1809> *phone regex
[11:11:26] <Danny1809> when you delete the phone number regex, then it is working fine... :S
[11:12:43] <snorti> Danny1809: http://jsfiddle.net/EAJYk/
[11:13:36] <snorti> Danny1809: this ok for you?
[11:15:41] <snorti> what is the best way here to gathering the data of that specific tr and send it to an page.php?var1=data&var2=data&var3=data&var4=data&var5=data ? http://jsfiddle.net/4kz9d/
[11:17:14] <diamonds> sanity check: http://jsfiddle.net/asNUR/
[11:17:18] <diamonds> what am I doing wrong here
[11:20:05] <Danny1809> snorti: sorry, I forgot to put the phone number part into the html part:. I updated your jsfiddle with it now... http://jsfiddle.net/EAJYk/1/
[11:20:21] <Danny1809> what is wrong? When I click on submit then it is crashing
[11:24:12] <snorti> Danny1809: dunno. i aint know jquery well
[11:24:38] <noaXess> if in a div the html content includes a uploadify flash button, and i try to $dialg.html("") to empty the dialog, in IE9 it breaks
[11:28:31] <Danny1809> Anyone who can help me??? Why my form is crashing when I am clicking on submit? It has something to do with the phone number part...  but I don't know why!? http://jsfiddle.net/Qeyqb/
[11:35:45] <snorti> what is the best way here to gathering the data of that specific tr and send it to an page.php?var1=data&var2=data&var3=data&var4=data&var5=data ? http://jsfiddle.net/4kz9d/

[11:39:26] <jedimind> oh i wrote a validation plugin once
[11:39:29] <jedimind> i jsut rememberred
[11:39:35] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/validajtor/
[11:39:56] <Danny1809>  I want to work without any third party plugins etc.
[11:42:36] <yezariael> I need some help with $.ajax when using it on a hyperlink. I want the browser to download the linked file normally. The ajax should on "click" send a request to a counter.php. Somehow, this always returns with an error that's not specified any more. Chrome's Network field just says "canceled". Any ideas?
[11:43:09] <jedimind> Danny1809 its basically exactly what you have only more isolated (ie not specific to those inputs and easier to implement)
[11:43:12] <jedimind> and works
[11:43:48] <jedimind> but i digress, i just remembered because i saw your code and it reminded me
[11:44:50] <Danny1809> Okay, I see... but can you tell me why my form is crashing when you are running it?
[11:45:19] <Danny1809> Unfortunately I have to stick to such a style / design like in my code...
[11:46:26] <snorti> i updated it: http://jsfiddle.net/4kz9d/ how to i send the [object HTMLTableRowElement] now to another page.php as string.. like page.php?var
[11:47:11] <maja> i am having a problem with getTime even though i have included dateAxisRenderer
[11:48:03] <shart> lol
[11:48:23] <maja> Uncaught TypeError: Object NaN has no method 'getTime'  ? :)
[11:53:21] <Danny1809> After I have integrated the phone number field in HTML and validation in jquery, my form is crashing when I am clicking on submit. Why??? http://jsfiddle.net/Qeyqb/
[11:58:23] <jedimind> "crashing"
[11:58:27] <jedimind> what is crashing exactly
[12:00:23] <Danny1809> jedimind: when you are running my jsfiddle and clicking on submit (in the form in the overlay) then you are getting an error ("crashing"),
[12:00:33] <Danny1809> http://jsfiddle.net/Qeyqb/
[12:01:13] <jedimind> i get a 403 error because the form is trying to submit to jsfiddle
[12:01:19] <jedimind> which its not allowed to do
[12:01:44] <jedimind> i mean its also not preventing me from just hitting submit
[12:02:06] <jedimind> Uncaught TypeError: Object /^(?=.*[a-zA-Z].*[a-zA-Z])(?=.*d.*d)[a-zA-Z0-9_]{6,20}$/ has no method 'test'
[12:02:57] <Danny1809> also when I am doing the same procedure on my local computer the form is not working then. the overlay form is just getting "closed".
[12:02:58] <jedimind> looks like your regexp for phone is wrong
[12:03:01] <Danny1809> How to fix that?
[12:05:11] <snorti> http://jsfiddle.net/4kz9d/ can someone take a look here. i want to send the cell data now to an other file over ? vars
[12:22:01] <JonYoder> Hey! I'm trying to do parralax scrolling for one image on a page, but I can't get jQuery to manipulate my background-position with scrolling.
[12:22:55] <JonYoder> this is the page I'm working on: http://www.jonyoder.com/new-home-page
[12:23:27] <JonYoder> This is the jQuery I have: http://www.jonyoder.com/blog/wp-content/themes/jons-clean-home-pre-2013/jons-JS.js // copied from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5001447/jquery-on-window-scroll-animate-background-image-position
[12:28:44] <Ansikt> Hey all
[12:28:59] <Ansikt> How to I count the last three elements in some selector
[12:29:30] <Ansikt> so, for example, if I have a <ul> with 5 <li>'s, how do I get the combined height of the last 3 li's only?
[12:30:00] <Ansikt> as I understand it, jQuery(',selector')[1] type of notation doesn't actually order the elements by their order in the dom
[12:30:08] <Ansikt> *.selector

[12:44:32] <kamoricks> How do you get JQuery 2.0 working on IE8? I keep getting "object does not have this property defined".
[12:44:42] <Saaether> when doing?
[12:44:51] <BillCriswell> kamoricks: Use 1.9
[12:44:52] <kamoricks> Simply including the script produces the error.
[12:45:31] <kzurawel> kamoricks: Yeah, 2.0 specifically cuts all support for IE 8
[12:45:37] <jedimind> kamoricks 2.0 is specifically NOT built for ie6,7,8,9
[12:45:46] <kamoricks> Alright, thanks.
[12:48:29] <_jo_> join #montagejs
[12:50:33] <Danny1809> How to replace the after-submission checks in my form with "on-the-fly" completeness and correctness checks? I know that I need the blur function for this! But I can't figure out how to realize that in my form? May you could help me? http://jsfiddle.net/mXsF8/
[12:52:08] <clov3r> _jo_... i'm the only one there? :P
[12:52:28] <_jo_> clov3r: It was #montage, not #montagejs.
[12:52:36] <_jo_> And I missed the / before 'join'.
[12:52:44] <clov3r> oh
[12:52:53] <clov3r> thought you were giving out tips :P
[12:53:11] <Danny1809> For example when you are clicking into the last name field and when this field is losing focus being empty then the blur function should remind you with the error message
[12:53:14] <Danny1809> http://jsfiddle.net/mXsF8/
[12:54:14] <kamoricks> In IE8 using JQuery 1.9.1, $(window).resize(function () { ... } ); is telling me that "Object doesn't support this property or method". What's the alternative?
[12:56:05] <tmacccc> buenas tardes
[12:57:09] <thang> que tal
[12:57:10] <tmacccc> hi
[12:57:16] <lejocelyn> hi, I'm wondering, how can ajax be blind friendly ? for example, is jquery ui tabs accessible?
[12:57:59] <Danny1809> How to put the blur functions for the validation checkings, for example when you are clicking into the last name field and when this field is losing focus being empty then the blur function should remind you with the error message http://jsfiddle.net/mXsF8/
[12:58:21] <Saaether> Danny1809 http://jsfiddle.net/mXsF8/1/
[12:59:04] <Danny1809> awesome, Saaether!
[12:59:10] <Saaether> theres a base method to give you an example
[12:59:42] <Danny1809> and if I also want to do this with the password field... then like $('#password').blur(function(){ ?
[12:59:54] <Saaether> i wouldnt really use blur though, id go with .change()
[13:00:07] <Danny1809> it is my task to work with blur... :(
[13:00:17] <Saaether> gettings errors while tabbing through a form is annoying
[13:00:25] <Saaether> ok =) heh
[13:00:40] <NoiseEee> Danny1809: indeed think about usability.
[13:00:41] <Danny1809> what about the password field?
[13:01:13] <Danny1809> It might be not that effective with blur... but I can't help it, I have to use this function.
[13:01:29] <NoiseEee> why don't you just validate upon submit?
[13:01:34] <tmacccc> http://michilot.com/tgec/ -> Anyone can help me ? Toogle effect 'explode' dont work good, why can be?
[13:02:13] <Saaether> Danny1809 just add :password to that function and it will catch it as well
[13:02:25] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/mXsF8/2/
[13:03:45] <Danny1809> shit, that was an easy thing... what didn't I have that thought?!
[13:03:52] <Danny1809> thanks, dude!
[13:04:08] <Danny1809> *why
[13:05:30] <jax> hello
[13:05:32] <tmacccc> http://michilot.com/tgec/ -> Anyone can help me ? Toogle effect 'explode' dont work good, why can be?
[13:07:59] <jax> i'm using bootstrap's collapse accordion component and would like to deactivate a header link based on a certain condition
[13:08:10] <jax> the links are like this: <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#collapseTwo">Collapse group 2</a>
[13:08:20] <jax> what's the easiest way to deactivate/activate a link
[13:08:27] <jax> remove data-toggle and add it again?
[13:10:58] <culh> I need to load content in to DOM that's not present at first load, but right after, as in during the first time the js is parsed. Is it possible?
[13:11:27] <culh> as in bind an event to DOM that's just done loading during the first load
[13:13:41] <danheberden> culh either bind those events after the elements are loaded, or use event delegation
[13:14:21] <danheberden> $(documentOrSomeParentContainerThatWillBePresent).on('eventName', 'selector', function(){});
[13:15:17] <danheberden> e.g.; $('#posts').on('click', '.post > h1', function() { console.log(this); }); would log the h1 dom node whenever you clicked it
[13:15:37] <danheberden> for any h1 inside of a .post element, regardless of when it was added
[13:15:42] <danheberden> assuming it's inside of #posts
[13:17:38] <culh> How can I simulate a 'click', that's my main problem. Does jq have an event that detects element creation?
[13:18:23] <culh> Or am I gonna have to load the content to an element that's already on DOM on first load? I'll have to do a lot of workarounds if that's the case.
[13:18:56] <NoiseEee> culh: you could use event delegation as danheberden showed you
[13:19:56] <danheberden> culh, you can simulate click for bound event handers using see ?trigger
[13:19:57] <bot-t> culh, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[13:21:50] <culh> Let me use danheberden's example to clarify my problem: I have element #form, and that el recieves html on first load. In that loaded content there's #posts, so still on first load, I want to $('#posts').load(...);
[13:22:06] <culh> ah! ok
[13:22:14] <tmacccc> http://michilot.com/tgec/ -> Anyone can help me ? Toogle effect 'explode' dont work good, why can be?
[13:22:14] <culh> trigger sounds like a solution
[13:26:27] <dan89> hi all, I have an if statement, where the if condition is an ajax function, on success of the ajax function I want to hide the element I just update with ajax. However what I'm running into is, the function is sucessful, the box is hidden but ajax updates it and it reappears.. anyone have any hints?
[13:30:37] <buzzedword> hey guys. looking for a good way to conditionally load jquery 2.x and 1.x as fast and early as possible-- with as little overhead as possible. any suggestions?
[13:31:11] <buzzedword> probably something stupid like a special conditional IE tag that just so happens to also execute in normal browsers, with my luck
[13:35:54] <buzzedword> *cough* nvm. yeah, it is. sorry bout that-- didn't dig this up till now: http://blog.jquery.com/2013/03/01/jquery-2-0-beta-2-released/

[13:59:49] <Foxhoundz> Does anyone have suggestions for a Twitter bootstrap alternative?
[14:02:10] <thang> what specifically are you looking for? a grid template, icons, css components?
[14:04:24] <wwwq> i m looking for a book with a usefull chapter about widget or plugin dev. - i m using design patters for my "classes" so i need something similar (or learn technics) for plugins or a way to "bind" events to a methode $(my-what-ever).buildUI; $(my-what-ever).evalEvents();if ($(my-what-ever).wasClicked) alert('yeah');
[14:09:29] <thrushaa> Foxhoundz: curb foundation is a common alternative
[14:10:23] <Foxhoundz> curb foundation?
[14:13:05] <cam> How do I do this, correctly? https://dpaste.de/2xOUV/
[14:15:53] <Foxhoundz> you mean .getJSON?
[14:16:18] <Foxhoundz> take a look at this, cam: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[14:16:48] <Foxhoundz> Make your second parameter for .getJSON into a callback function to replace .don()
[14:16:53] <Foxhoundz> done()*
[14:17:05] <Foxhoundz> Since you're not sending any parameters with the GET request ( the "{}")
[14:17:50] <cam> I've read that page, Foxhoundz.
[14:18:00] <cam> I also tried that way you're suggesting.
[14:18:05] <cam> It also didn't return anything but a []
[14:22:52] <Foxhoundz> console.log the response to see what you're getting from your php script
[14:23:12] <Foxhoundz> and append failure handlers to the call
[14:23:25] <Foxhoundz> i.e. .fail()
[14:24:35] <noaXess> another strange thing.. jquery 1.9.1 and ui 1.10.1.. dialog which get's content over $.get().. if scroll position is really at bottom of a long text.. and a dialog willb eopened, the window will scroll some 100px up.. and dialog is offscreen
[14:24:44] <noaXess> any hint? i read about that was in earlier versions and fixed..
[14:25:22] <rainabba_> I'm trying to use https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie but when I call $.cookie() I get Object function ... has no method 'cookie'. I run the contents of jquery.cookie.js in the console and tried again and it worked. Are they using an interface not compatible with 1.9.1 or is there more to using this plugin than just including it on the page?
[14:27:01] <cam> Foxhoundz, I am getting the right data.
[14:27:08] <cam> It's all in the "data" param of my .done function.
[14:27:11] <cam> I've console.log'd that.
[14:27:15] <cam> I just can't append it to items and then return them
[14:27:20] <cam> It's something to do with the scope I think.
[14:27:21] <cam> Any ideas?
[14:27:34] <Foxhoundz> pastebin the structure of returned JSON
[14:28:29] <cam> [{"display_name":"cam","user_id":"qsafaw;IJTIL24UTFA"}, {"display_name":"bob","user_id":"asfajglakdhgsdg"}]
[14:30:56] <thang> cam: throw up a debugger in your done callback so you can see what exactly youre getting back and how you need to massage that data
[14:31:10] <cam> thang, I am getting what I expect.
[14:31:20] <cam> The json call isn't the issue.
[14:31:26] <cam> The fact is that when I say x = getUserInfo()
[14:31:32] <cam> x is [], not a populated array.
[14:32:28] <NoiseEee> so debug getUserInfo() ?
[14:32:51] <NoiseEee> are you trying to access the data before its returned?  are you using the callback properly cam?
[14:33:00] <cam> I'm here to ask you if I am.
[14:33:02] <cam> I have no idea.
[14:33:06] <cam> Clearly something isn't working.
[14:33:13] <thang> right, as in a debugger line after $.each to observe items after it is supposed to be mutated
[14:34:05] <obert_> is it easy to create an inclined line in a background?
[14:34:42] <obert_> i tried with css3 rotate, but it looks weird
[14:35:00] <dylan9o4> Alright, there are 2 ways to trigger the datalist element to show, 1. By having the element focused, THEN clicking it. 2. By having the element focused, THEN pressing the down arrow. I have been trying to trigger this event but cannot seem to. Is this not possible? http://jsbin.com/ehudol/1/edit
[14:35:03] <obert_> i should stop to have sick ideas
[14:36:02] <Foxhoundz> cam: your code should work fine with the data
[14:36:17] <cam> Foxhoundz, it isn't...
[14:38:25] <Foxhoundz> try inserting this before pushing it into the array:      alert(item['display_name']);
[14:38:32] <Foxhoundz> if it's parsing it properly, it should return a string
[14:38:40] <Foxhoundz> if not, then there's your issue
[14:39:16] <cam> Foxhoundz, it's workig.
[14:39:21] <cam> It's that I can't /save/ the data somewhere.
[14:39:25] <cam> I want it to be in a global variable or something.
[14:39:34] <cam> Because I am going to be using it as the user navigates my page.
[14:41:21] <cam> Foxhoundz, let me put it this way.
[14:41:32] <cam> I just want a damn function that grabs a page of json and returns it.
[14:41:37] <cam> Why is this so hard to do.
[14:41:41] <cam> I just don't get it.
[14:42:04] <myosotis> then set it as the value of a global variable
[14:42:08] <cam> I did!
[14:43:30] <thrushaa> cam: $.getJSON is asynconous
[14:43:39] <cam> oh.
[14:43:49] <cam> Well that's a bummer.
[14:44:04] <cam> And they didn't feel the need to mention that in the docs..
[14:44:05] <thrushaa> .done() is also async
[14:44:16] <cam> ASFAJSKGAG
[14:44:25] <Foxhoundz> you can disable async
[14:44:28] <Foxhoundz> but I wouldn't recommend it
[14:44:29] <thang> $.ajax has an async: false option
[14:44:38] <cam> Foxhoundz, I /need/ this data before the page loads.
[14:44:49] <cam> It's from a local php file. It'll execute quickly. I just /need/ the data.
[14:45:08] <myosotis> cam, why not generate a javascript tag with php and set your data there?
[14:45:08] <cam> And why the hell is it not mentioned in the docs that it is async?
[14:45:21] <thrushaa> it says it in the second sentance
[14:45:26] <cam> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[14:45:27] <thrushaa> "This is a shorthand Ajax function, which is equivalent to"
[14:45:32] <thrushaa> the A in Ajax
[14:45:36] <thrushaa> is always for async
[14:45:38] <cam> -.-
[14:45:39] <myosotis> so it will already be on the page when the dom is loaded and your javascript starts executing?
[14:45:41] <cam> That would've been nice to know.
[14:45:48] <cam> myosotis, because I need an API anyways.
[14:46:10] <cam> I guess I will just do that.
[14:46:14] <myosotis> there's nothing stopping you from doing that
[14:47:43] <cam> myosotis, it's been a long day man...
[14:47:48] <cam> I'm clearly not thinking so good..
[14:47:59] <cam> I don'tknow why I didn't do that in the first place.
[14:48:16] <cam> I already had all the code for the json encoding of the mysql stuff... I just don't know.
[14:49:17] <myosotis> it happens...
[14:54:55] <Spawnrj> someone could help me, I need to know how to use the channel. I have a doubt in jquery for a project I'm developing?

[15:44:11] <anew> i forgot, what is that trick to attach templates to divs, but you dont show the div until you attach it?  you name the <div> something like <script> cant remember exatly
[15:44:28] <JohnnyCache> how does call that thing that i can pick from a range of numbers with my mouse :X
[15:44:34] <JohnnyCache> like scroll
[15:44:35] <JohnnyCache> nu
[15:44:40] <JohnnyCache> dont know how it calls :\
[15:45:31] <JohnnyCache> like slider
[15:46:02] <JohnnyCache> oh found it

[16:08:49] <holymacaroons> I'm trying to get the div containing the data-role="content" to have it's content within the header and footer. Is the only way to do this with a frame element?
[16:19:40] <moot_12> Any help on this?? http://jsfiddle.net/AtpzE/1/
[16:21:10] <moot_12> stackoverflow question asked by me on this - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16908388/jquery-ajax-call-returns-error-when-the-rest-service-is-returning-a-string
[16:21:38] <Primer> Should $(selector).unbind() cause the matched element to not have any event bindings at all? I'm reading the docs, and it seems to suggest this, but the input fields that match the selector still have event bindings.
[16:21:57] <holymacaroons> i got the div to center between the header and footer.
[16:23:14] <Primer> moot_12: if it's cross domain, you need to wrap it in the callback
[16:25:56] <moot_12> Primer: even if the response is a text?
[16:26:49] <shoky> Primer: it should remove all bound events yeah. won't work if the event is delegated to another element though
[16:26:54] <Primer> moot_12: anything cross domain is just wrapped in <script> tags, AFAIK. If you just have text in a script tag and not code, it's just crap
[16:27:35] <shoky> that's only if you use JSONP
[16:28:02] <Primer> shoky: should the event handlers being null'ed be reflected in chrome developer's events area?
[16:28:14] <shoky> moot_12: you said a few days ago you were gonna set up a testcase i can connect to and see the prob :P
[16:28:29] <Primer> err unbound
[16:28:40] <moot_12> shoky: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/AtpzE/1/ :)
[16:28:44] <shoky> Primer: for events that were bound with jquery, yeah i think so
[16:29:02] <Primer> shoky: ahh so that's the rub. This event is set inline
[16:29:05] <shoky> moot_12:  XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://env-1072283.jelastic.servint.net/hello/fdsf. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[16:29:08] <Primer> This is someone else's site, btw
[16:29:14] <shoky> moot_12: that means your server does not support CORS
[16:29:31] <shoky> Primer: ah then that explains it yup
[16:29:43] <Primer> so inline it's onkeypress="bla"
[16:29:50] <Primer> How do I nuke that? .attr()?
[16:29:59] <shoky> i suppose, yeah
[16:30:38] <Primer> doesn't work
[16:30:51] <Primer> although it's reflected in the DOM, the old event still seems to trigger
[16:31:16] <Primer> $("#aoframe").contents().find("input#scoutField1").attr('onkeypress', 'return true;'); <input type=â€‹"text" class=â€‹"logintext" name=â€‹"scoutField1" id=â€‹"scoutField1" value autocomplete=â€‹"off" onkeypress=â€‹"return true;â€‹">â€‹]
[16:31:49] <moot_12> shoky: yes it is a 3rd party site which i used to host a simple rest service
[16:32:10] <Primer> Basically this site has a REALLY REALLY annoying set of login fields. You can't 1) paste into them, or 2) hit backspace if you fuck up
[16:32:24] <shoky> moot_12: then that's not a real testcase of your problem, is it
[16:32:30] <moot_12> shoky: anyway i'll try to install corsfilter to eliminate that possibility on my server - https://bitbucket.org/jsumners/corsfilter
[16:32:33] <Primer> And I'm trying to disable their event handlers
[16:32:43] <shoky> moot_12: cool, that's what you said a few days ago too :P
[16:33:07] <Primer> But the form is in an iframe, and the onkeypress is set to some variable that I can't access from a js console, presumably because it's in the iframe
[16:33:30] <shoky> Primer: you can change the context of the console
[16:33:39] <moot_12> shoky: yes i did. tried to do it and faced some issues. Will try again today
[16:34:00] <Primer> shoky: I've never done that. Looking into it (Unless you can tell me quickly)
[16:34:07] <shoky> Primer: in chrome click the <top frame> selectbox on the bottom bar in devtools.  or in firebug you can use the cd(..) command i think
[16:34:24] <Primer> shoky: lovely! Thanks
[16:35:14] <shoky> Primer: though setting the attr is working for me. didnt try iframe though
[16:36:19] <Primer> shoky: it's really insidious what these people did
[16:36:27] <Primer> https://rprqa.narrpr.com/
[16:36:33] <Primer> if you're curious
[16:39:30] <shoky> Primer: you need to wait until the iframe is loaded and it'll work
[16:39:56] <shoky> Primer:  $('#aoframe").load(function() { $(this).contents().find.......;  });
[16:40:12] <shoky> assuming you were doing it on page load
[16:40:15] <Primer> I'm just doing that in the console
[16:40:25] <Primer> like I said, that's not my site
[16:40:28] <shoky> oh and it doesnt work there?
[16:40:33] <Primer> but someone that I have to interact with
[16:41:19] <Primer> well, I've tried these:
[16:41:21] <Primer> $("#aoframe").contents().find("input#scoutField1").unbind();
[16:41:35] <Primer> $("#aoframe").contents().find("input#scoutField1").attr('onkeypress', 'return true;');
[16:41:39] <Primer> no effect
[16:42:01] <Primer> if I type in the email field, and hit backspace, all the text is removed
[16:42:55] <shoky> Primer: and you're sure it's that $AOFA.checkEnter  that's doing it/
[16:44:24] <Primer> it's not
[16:44:57] <Primer> there are several events that seem to be bound, according to chrome's event area in elements
[16:44:58] <codeshah> hey guys, I am using jQuery get to grab Facebook feed and show on pageâ€¦ but I want to cache this
[16:45:00] <codeshah> what's the best way?
[16:45:17] <codeshah> I am using c#  /asp.net so I can always do it in the codebehind, but it would be nice ot keep the jQ code and just cache somehow
[16:45:28] <Primer> but they all go into a jquery.min
[16:45:36] <Primer> so adding a breakpoint...sucks
[16:48:27] <shoky> Primer: it's  https://scout.narrpr.com/pck3f-4/js/combined/flashalternativecombined_min11.24.100.100.js   line 2455
[16:52:29] <Primer> curious...how did you determine this?
[16:52:50] <shoky> Primer: using the timeline ;p
[16:53:58] <Primer> that file isn't even in the list of sources here
[16:54:49] <shoky> that's weird
[16:56:58] <shoky> Primer:  var f = $('#aoframe'), F$ = f[0].contentWindow.jQuery;  F$('#scoutField1').unbind()
[16:57:16] <shoky> Primer: those events were bound using jquery, but the iframe's jquery
[16:59:16] <Primer> ok, that makes sense
[16:59:45] <Primer> awesome
[17:10:44] <fonko> guys i have a response wich is a JSON object like this {"request":"23423423", "to":["232342343"]}
[17:11:03] <fonko> eaach of those is 1 unit.. i want to knwo how many units do i have... how can i know that?
[17:11:45] <fonko> for example, if i knew how many "request" or "to" i would know how many "units" do i have... how do you do that?

[17:16:00] <blainegarrett> Since posting I have found that .html(), .text() and .get(0).innerHTML all have the &quot; converted to string literal.
[17:24:29] <shoky> blainegarrett: all jquery is doing is setting the innerHTML of the element
[17:26:45] <Blaster> hello I am having a strange issue.  Please see here: http://jsfiddle.net/SXccE/   I am setting click handlers by iterating over some JSON, but both elements are getting the same handler?
[17:27:21] <shoky> blainegarrett: so I don't see how that would be unexpected behaviour.  element.innerHTML = '&quot;'    would do the same thing
[17:28:19] <blainegarrett> trying that now, but it seems weird that it is different than the DOM's innerHTML val when set in pure dom
[17:29:12] <shoky> blainegarrett: it has nothing to do with jquery
[17:29:21] <Blaster> Did I find a jquery bug? http://jsfiddle.net/SXccE/
[17:29:24] <shoky> besides the fact that jquery uses innerHTML
[17:29:39] <Eviltwin> Hah, I'm havint this exact same conversation in #jquery-dev
[17:29:57] <shoky> heh
[17:30:03] <Eviltwin> Blaster: You found a novice JavaScript pitfall
[17:30:15] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  What's the pitfall?
[17:30:28] <Eviltwin> Blaster: http://jsfiddle.net/SXccE/1/
[17:30:38] <Eviltwin> Only functions create new scopes
[17:30:52] <Eviltwin> "i" only exists in one place there
[17:31:07] <Blaster> Why's that?
[17:31:13] <Eviltwin> Because that's how JavaScript works
[17:31:32] <Blaster> how can I read about this?
[17:31:40] <Blaster> I have been working in jQuery for a while and have never encountered that
[17:32:20] <shoky> fonko: Object.keys(obj).length  or for old browsers use a for..in loop and count
[17:32:20] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[17:33:16] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Just a sec
[17:33:42] <shoky> Blaster:  by the time the click handler runs, the loop has already long finished, and i has its final value
[17:34:05] <Eviltwin> Blaster: http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/#function.closures
[17:34:09] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to "Closures Inside Loops"
[17:34:25] <Blaster> EvilTwin:   I guess it's because I haven't stored a jquery object inside of JSON before?
[17:34:32] <Eviltwin> It's the third subheading
[17:34:37] <Eviltwin> It has NOTHING to do with JSON
[17:34:48] <Eviltwin> And everything to do with the fact that you're defining a function inside a loop
[17:34:50] <shoky> or jquery
[17:34:58] <Primer> Yeah, this is javascript 101
[17:35:09] <Eviltwin> Well, I'd say it's more like JavaScript 201
[17:35:10] <Primer> You should have encountered this by now
[17:35:19] <Eviltwin> It's not a truly novice concept
[17:35:37] <Eviltwin> But it's something you should have learned before even writing your first line of jQuery
[17:35:40] <Eviltwin> At least in my opinion
[17:35:41] <Primer> well, closure is inherent
[17:35:42] <Eviltwin> ?learn
[17:35:42] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[17:35:57] <Primer> If you're using callbacks, you're going to run into that
[17:36:31] <mechanicalduck> hi
[17:36:57] <Eviltwin> If I were numbering it I'd probably consider JavaScript 101 to really be more like programming 101
[17:37:23] <Eviltwin> Since unfortunately many people start with JavaScript as their first language
[17:37:27] <mechanicalduck> what is the right channel for nodejs?
[17:37:31] <Eviltwin> #nodejs?
[17:37:33] <Eviltwin> #node?
[17:37:34] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure
[17:37:38] <shoky> #Node.js
[17:37:49] <Eviltwin> Ah
[17:43:37] <moot_12> shoky: corsfilter worked like a charm!
[17:44:02] <moot_12> shoky: thanks for your help! appreciate it!
[17:44:16] <amph1bius> is there a good spinning wheel plugin? for ajax calls
[17:46:20] <Eviltwin> amph1bius: Not sure but usually I just fine a spinning wheel I like and do the tiny bit of required jQuery to hook it up where I need it
[17:46:33] <amph1bius> yeah hm
[17:49:32] <shoky> moot_12: glad to hear it ;) np
[17:56:14] <hugo_moss> eviltwin: is it bad to start with javascript as your first programming language?
[17:58:31] <lindii_> How can i return a single value from a select statement using PDo?
[17:59:13] <lindii_> wrong channel
[18:06:56] <Eviltwin> hugo_moss: I consider starting with in-browser lax JavaScript to be a very bad idea
[18:07:16] <Eviltwin> It's hard to work with
[18:07:22] <Eviltwin> Making accidental infinite loops and what not
[18:07:32] <Eviltwin> And yet also pretty flexible in ways it probably shouldn't be
[18:07:44] <Eviltwin> Like with unscoped vars and what not
[18:08:25] <Eviltwin> Plus I think it's better to teach standard synchronous programming before being thrown into an async world
[18:08:53] <Eviltwin> And there are hundreds of tutorials that use (what are at least now considered) truly awful bad practices
[18:12:27] <dylan9o4> Eviltwin: hi
[18:13:45] <Eviltwin> Yo
[18:13:53] <dylan9o4> Eviltwin: Can you tell me why this would say "BODY", rather than "TD"
[18:13:56] <dylan9o4> http://jsbin.com/inawid/1/edit
[18:14:49] <Eviltwin> Because your DOM's been fixed
[18:14:58] <Eviltwin> You can't have a <td> floating on its own in the body
[18:15:07] <Eviltwin> They're only valid inside <tr>s which are only valid inside <table>s
[18:15:26] <dylan9o4> gotcha
[18:15:38] <dylan9o4> I didn't know it would fix itself
[18:16:21] <Eviltwin> Yeah, you have no guarantees on what the DOM will look like if do something syntactically incorrect
[18:26:57] <bobbobbins> hey, I'm calling a function and getting an error that says its not a functionâ€¦but in the console it runs just fine
[18:27:08] <bobbobbins> anyone know why that happens?
[18:27:30] <coldhead> it might not be available at the time the code runs
[18:27:36] <coldhead> you might be loading files in the wrong order
[18:27:45] <bobbobbins> its in a document ready thing
[18:27:46] <coldhead> or you might not be waiting for $(document).ready()
[18:28:13] <coldhead> i would drop a debugger; statement just before the function fails
[18:28:15] <coldhead> to pause there
[18:28:17] <coldhead> and see what's up
[18:28:24] <bobbobbins> ok
[18:36:42] <relipse> Can someone reproduce these cool google tabs using html/css ? http://goo.gl/cKlvz
[18:38:29] <tw2113> i don't see why not
[18:38:33] <lenswipee> lol
[18:38:51] <lenswipee> it is cool but lacks color.
[18:39:00] <imsky> those cool css tabs can be reproduced using css
[18:39:08] <imsky> hmm that didn't come out right
[18:50:08] <luisangelmarquez> y
[18:51:08] <luisangelmarquez> wow really excited to be here
[18:51:26] <LuxuryMode> I have a .click defined but it gets called as soon as the page loads before any clickingâ€¦how can i fix this?
[18:51:31] <luisangelmarquez> learning jquery from front end masters, can't wait to become a pro
[18:52:13] <LuxuryMode> apparently i needed a reference to the function
[18:52:14] <LuxuryMode> whoops
[18:52:21] <LuxuryMode> not the call with myFunction()
[18:56:26] <bobbobbins> changing the $s to jQuerys fixed it
[19:04:21] <coldhead> great work everyone
[19:05:20] <relipse> shoky: you there?
[19:05:34] <coldhead> relipse and shoky, sitting in a tree
[19:05:55] <relipse> i think he goes to bed around this time
[19:20:53] <raj> what's double submit of cookie? http://erlend.oftedal.no/blog/?blogid=118
[19:23:27] <coldhead> i've never heard of it
[19:25:10] <raj> ya right
[19:25:34] <coldhead> it's probably not important
[19:25:46] <raj> ok
[19:26:10] <raj> coldhead, where might I run into issues if I do the csrf_token inclusion globally as that article suggests?
[19:26:28] <raj> is there ever I don't want a csrf_token?
[19:26:41] <coldhead> i never want them
[19:26:47] <raj> because?
[19:26:48] <coldhead> because it's an extra layer of complexity
[19:26:58] <raj> and protection?
[19:27:05] <coldhead> protection from what?
[19:27:11] <raj> csrf
[19:27:16] <raj> attacks
[19:27:20] <coldhead> i might use them for account creations
[19:27:29] <coldhead> if i thought people were gonna abuse them
[19:27:44] <coldhead> but unless you're using rails or something that makes it really easy so you don't have to think about it
[19:27:48] <coldhead> i personally wouldn't bother
[19:27:55] <coldhead> then again, i don't follow best practice
[19:27:58] <coldhead> i follow actual practice
[19:28:05] <coldhead> which is that people only actually use facebook
[19:28:12] <coldhead> and not any sites anyone else ever makes
[19:28:19] <raj> I am using a framework
[19:28:30] <raj> just wondering if globally adding it from jquery is a good idea
[19:28:31] <coldhead> so you just need jquery to handle it too?
[19:28:36] <coldhead> sure it is
[19:28:42] <coldhead> if you can do it easily
[19:28:44] <coldhead> then go nuts
[19:28:47] <raj> I can
[19:28:49] <coldhead> i can't think of a good reason not to
[19:28:52] <coldhead> other than the complexity
[19:28:53] <raj> it's required for https, right?
[19:28:58] <coldhead> and if the framework is handling that
[19:28:59] <coldhead> then :D
[19:29:05] <coldhead> not that i'm aware of it isn't
[19:29:11] <raj> oh
[19:29:25] <raj> hmm, dunno why I thought it was
[19:29:30] <raj> what's required to be https?
[19:29:53] <coldhead> https is the transport layer
[19:29:58] <coldhead> tokens are application layer
[19:30:02] <coldhead> never the twain shall meet
[19:30:05] <raj> ah, I see
[19:30:36] <raj> so how can I make my webpage https?
[19:30:52] <raj> some sort of encryption?
[19:31:01] <coldhead> buy a certificate
[19:31:07] <coldhead> set up the server to serve https
[19:31:17] <coldhead> it shouldn't affect the content at all
[19:31:23] <lenswipee> or create a self-signed SSL cert.
[19:31:24] <raj> so facebook pays for a certificate?
[19:31:32] <coldhead> they sure do
[19:31:35] <raj> ah ok, that sounds more like it
[19:31:56] <raj> i remember I used to get a browser warning about facebook's certificate
[19:32:04] <lenswipee> plenty of free SSL cert too.
[19:32:18] <raj> so what's going on with this certificate?
[19:32:26] <raj> how do I implement it?
[19:32:33] <raj> or what's the flow like?
[19:32:49] <relipse> when you create new hidden inputs you have to add type="hidden" like so, correct? $('<input type="hidden" />')[0];
[19:32:57] <lenswipee> raj: You start with google.com and it flows from there.
[19:32:59] <relipse> i heard IE chokes if you don't
[19:33:08] <coldhead> the flow is step 1, google "how to setup https" and then step 2, hire someone to do it for you when it all gets too hard
[19:33:13] <relipse> raj: you can make your own certificate
[19:33:15] <tw2113> IE chokes in general
[19:33:27] <relipse> this is important that IE does not choke
[19:33:32] <relipse> there are users that use IE
[19:33:52] <coldhead> relipse: ie doesn't like when you change the type of an input
[19:34:00] <coldhead> so you want to set it up right from the get go
[19:34:03] <tw2113> and there are people who think the government is good too
[19:35:31] <lenswipee> i would like to fire many people in government
[19:36:26] <tw2113> commit voter fraud, rush between each state and vote for their opponant next election
[19:37:22] <coldhead> the government is the least of our problems
[19:37:40] <tw2113> rabid dingos?
[19:37:56] <coldhead> not even in the top 100
[19:38:09] <tw2113> they should make a comeback
[19:39:23] <raj> what ssl certificates will not alert the browser AND are free?
[19:39:35] <raj> they provide some sort of encryption?
[19:41:10] <coldhead> raj, please
[19:41:14] <coldhead> this is not jquery related
[19:41:18] <coldhead> and it's easily googleable
[19:41:25] <coldhead> don't make me go upside your head
[19:43:17] <wilkinsmc> Does google crawl pages with javascript enabled?
[19:43:31] <wilkinsmc> i'm afraid it's getting to my mobile pages because whatever pc it uses to do it doesn't have a screen
[19:43:31] <coldhead> KINDA
[19:43:50] <coldhead> from what i've seen, wilkinsmc, it scrapes JS files for URLs and visit thems
[19:43:53] <wilkinsmc> in my java it's if (screesize < 780 pixels) {go to mobile.html}
[19:44:13] <coldhead> no in that case i don't THINK it runs JS
[19:44:19] <coldhead> at least it didn't used to
[19:44:19] <wilkinsmc> oic
[19:44:28] <wilkinsmc> better not, otherwise my low page rank is fixable
[19:44:30] <wilkinsmc> and i'm lazy
[19:49:16] <tw2113> just get into responsive web design
[19:52:56] <lenswipee> tw2113: what does that even mean?
[19:53:16] <tw2113> ?g responsive web design
[19:53:21] <bot-t> tw2113, Responsive web design - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design
[19:53:21] <b-ot> tw2113: Responsive web design - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia â†’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design
[19:53:37] <relipse> designing so that when you resize your browser it works for smaller screens and mobile devices
[19:54:30] <lenswipee> relipse: i think all you have to do is use % instead of px in your css.
[19:54:40] <tw2113> it's more than that
[19:54:43] <tw2113> trust me
[19:55:04] <lenswipee> tw2113: may be a little bit more :)
[19:55:14] <tw2113> or you know, a decent amount
[19:55:28] <coldhead> you can show or hide things entirely depending on screen size
[19:55:35] <coldhead> can't do that with percentages
[19:55:55] <lenswipee> 0% will hide things
[19:56:15] <lenswipee> just like that jsfiddle you created for me the other day.
[19:57:01] <relipse> sigh
[20:04:36] <wilkinsmc> is there any way to do if (googlebot) in jquery?
[20:04:56] <wilkinsmc> or maybe replace if screensize with if mobile
[20:11:32] <LuxuryMode> how can i insert a variable into the html im adding to my doc? e.g. $('#invite-code-table').find('> tbody:last').append('<tr><td>foo</td></tr>'); where I want foo to be a variable
[20:27:28] <wilkinsmc> will this work? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3514784/what-is-the-best-way-to-detect-a-handheld-device-in-jquery
[20:27:35] <wilkinsmc> cuz i just did it :3
[20:30:09] <wilkinsmc> naw me
[20:30:16] <wilkinsmc> niuuuh
[20:40:20] <wilkinsmc> google's navigating to my mobile page
[20:40:33] <wilkinsmc> even with if( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) {  // some code.. }
[20:40:45] <wilkinsmc> does the google crawler work off a phone? this is bullshit
[20:40:49] <wilkinsmc> has to be the reason my page ranks so low
[20:45:24] <wilkinsmc> hmmm
[20:45:29] <wilkinsmc> my mobile page doesn't come up in google tho
[20:45:36] <wilkinsmc> so it can't be the main page google sees
[20:49:32] <wilkinsmc> i dunno
[20:49:38] <wilkinsmc> data highlighter shows mobile page
[20:55:54] <wilkinsmc> I mean, could my page, after SEO and withdstanding looking better than all other pages of the same category, really be ranking on page 9 in organic search?
[20:55:58] <wilkinsmc> what what the the fuck fuck?
[20:56:18] <wilkinsmc> for a local business, no less
[21:01:22] <heshanh> hey guys, i have a nested ul/li (superfish menu). li a ul. how do i prepend something just before the UL but after the A. i tried $('ul.sf-menu a+ul').prepend('bla') but it puts it after the UL
[21:02:35] <heshanh> im trying to do this , http://jsfiddle.net/6vp3U/  so i need to insert '<div class="mobnav-subarrow"></div>' line before the UL
[21:20:59] <wilkinsmc> do you think smiley faces are good to use in google adwords?
[21:21:02] <wilkinsmc> i'm not sure how older people think
[21:21:18] <wilkinsmc> i'm pretty sure a lot of older people are like, "wow, he must be a total fag to use a smiley face"
[21:21:26] <LuxuryMode> hmm twitter glyphicons didnt work when i deployed to heroku
[21:21:36] <wilkinsmc> and the women think, "what if he rapes me"
[21:21:41] <wilkinsmc> i need to hire a psychologist
[21:47:06] <coldhead> Dear Project Manager, Not everything is "very cool". Learn some other phrases.
[21:49:06] <Eviltwin> I disagree
[21:52:52] <tw2113> Project Manager said supporting IE6 is cool
[21:52:56] <tw2113> what now Eviltwin
[22:12:31] <coldhead> Eviltwin: Very cool
[22:18:52] <__machine> im having a problem cloning a form... clone = $('#container').clone(); then clone.find('[id^=id_form-]').each(function(e) {$(this).attr('id', new_id($(this).attr('id'))).val('')}); ... then when the form is submitted, fields that were duplicated and were cleared in the clone fields... are submitted with two values... ?
[22:19:28] <freeuser> oh fancy seeing tw2113 in here, oh as i was saying your don't sanitize (escape html) user input on "input", as html injections won't work in a database. You sanitise user input on "output".
[22:21:13] <coldhead> __machine: gonna need to see the code and the html for that sucker
[22:21:32] <freeuser> anyone agree with that guy comment below: <tw2113> 10 out of 10 security experts agree: sanitize your data going in and out
[22:23:47] <coldhead> i agree with everything tw2113 says
[22:23:53] <coldhead> he's a smart dude
[22:25:01] <freeuser> coldhead: umm... are you being serious?
[22:25:43] <coldhead> yes
[22:25:49] <coldhead> i have given tw2113 $$ before
[22:25:53] <coldhead> for his expertise
[22:26:02] <coldhead> professional relationship
[22:26:15] <coldhead> i basically do whatever he tells me to do
[22:26:30] <__machine> coldhead: when i clone each form field, it has the same id as the original... so i alter the id with attr() ... when i inspect the page before submitting, it has the new id... but when i submit, the post data has the original field id listed twice...
[22:26:48] <freeuser> coldhead: OK, now I know you're not being serious. Happy to chat when you decide to be serious!
[22:27:21] <coldhead> i am completely serious
[22:28:03] <coldhead> __machine: i would guess you're renaming ALL the fields?
[22:28:07] <coldhead> not just the cloned ones?
[22:28:26] <coldhead> no, apparently not
[22:28:29] <coldhead> clone.find()
[22:28:30] <freeuser> coldhead: Then why escape html user input on "input" when html injections don't work in database?
[22:28:41] <coldhead> are you putting the cloned form inside the other form?
[22:28:45] <coldhead> i can't tell because i can't see the code
[22:28:59] <__machine> no, i am renaming only the cloned ones... and when i inspect the page, only the new fields are renamed... but in POST data only the original field names appear, but duplicated
[22:29:13] <__machine> the new fields go into the same form
[22:29:28] <coldhead> __machine: you're changing the IDs but not the names?
[22:29:31] <coldhead> name="aids"?
[22:29:41] <coldhead> you wanna rename both maybe?
[22:29:52] <__machine> ah that makes sense... duh...
[22:31:50] <coldhead> freeuser: i don't consider escaping html to be the same thing as sanitizing
[22:31:51] <__machine> boom... fixed... thank you!
[22:32:07] <coldhead> but if you're taking user inpiut then, yes, obviously, try to make it as non-evil as possible
[22:32:53] <freeuser> coldhead: what do you consider escaping html as in comparison to sanitizing?
[22:33:14] <coldhead> escaping html just turns it into html you have to unescape if you ever want to see it
[22:33:25] <coldhead> sanitzing (to me) would be removing certain tags
[22:33:38] <coldhead> or removing ALL the html and turning it into plain text
[22:38:08] <freeuser> coldhead: wrong. many sanitizing functions do not remove certain tags - they encode them.
[22:39:07] <coldhead> yeah i wouldn't trust my opinions, it's my first day using jQuery
[22:39:15] <coldhead> actually this isn't really a jQuery topic anyway
[22:39:29] <coldhead> why don't you take it back to #joomla or #wordpress or w/ee
[22:39:51] <freeuser> coldhead: no, but since you responded. I had to correct you. cheers.
[22:40:01] <coldhead> and i'm a better person for being corrected
[22:40:08] <coldhead> i will never shoot my mouth off again
[22:40:43] <coldhead> murder murder murder murder murder murder murder
[22:40:46] <freeuser> coldhead: don't be like that.
[22:40:53] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:40:56] <freeuser> coldhead: it's all good.
[22:41:11] <coldhead> it's better than good, it's great!

[23:03:23] <andkore> what's the difference between $. and $().  ? I thought they were equivalent, but $().ajax isn't working for me
[23:07:04] <coldhead> andkore: $().whatever is when you operate on whatever is inside the $()
[23:07:08] <coldhead> $('selector').doStuff()
[23:07:16] <coldhead> $.ajax() etc is for utilities
[23:07:28] <coldhead> that don't apply to specific selected elements
[23:07:34] <andkore> thanks. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3383927/when-should-a-period-be-used-after-in-jquery <-- that helped me too
[23:07:56] <andkore> $() is a function and $. is an object, right?
[23:08:11] <andkore> the period is the accessor. you're accessing a property/method
