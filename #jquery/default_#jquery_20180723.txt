[03:43:57] <ben69> hello, i'm using jquery-form and nothing append when i click my submit button (i don't get the logs i put in my success and beforeSend functions) any idea on where should i start looking ?
[03:45:09] <ben69> i get the other all arround logs
[05:41:39] <robhol> Hi there. Quick question; can I use some clever jq stuff to remove stuff based on comments? for example if I have <!--begin asdf--> unwanted stuff <!--end asdf-->
[05:42:19] <robhol> or, well, I'm sort of assuming it's possible. not sure about the best way though.
[05:58:56] <how2hack> hi, quick question: i'm using .html() to update content (json) every x seconds, the problem is when i have scrolled or am scrolling, then .html() resets the scroll to the top (i understand why this happens, i just didn't expected until i saw it), is there any way to update the content without loosing the scroll position?
[06:13:43] <shoky> how2hack: if possible, just .append() to it instead of replacing the whole content with .html().  and if that's not possible, you'd prolly need to store the .scrollTop of the element, and reset it to that value after replacing the contents
[06:29:02] <ryan_ford> is freenode imploding?
[10:44:32] <MikeD_> is there a feature for add class if condition else remove it?
[11:32:05] <Stutters> Hello there :)
[11:32:07] <Stutters> Does anybody know of a functionality in jquery that is able to feed a response to an element even if the response isn't fully complete yet? What I have in mind is a server side progress fed to the client via php ob_flush() + flush(). Right now jquery just waits for the response to be complete, then appends it to the body..
[11:34:05] <Stutters> My response consists of multiple codes like this: <script>alert('Stage x/3');</script>. Those have a delay in between them. Jquery waits for the full response obviously killing the whole purpose of that progress display. Any ideas? :)
[11:37:02] <jquery136> how is it possible to display just one error at a time with jquery validation please guys?
[11:37:34] <jquery136> here is my validation http://jsfiddle.net/4vpequLn/
[11:39:00] <taplar> i'm not sure if there is a built in way to only do one at a time.  you'd probably have to write a custom validator for the individual elements that conditionally requires them.
[11:41:04] <taplar> https://jqueryvalidation.org/required-method/   yeah, so if you go down through those examples, there's one that provides a selector for another element, followed by an example of giving it a method
[11:48:47] <jquery136> ok thank you
[11:55:15] <Stutters> Can I make jquery NOT collect the complete ajax response but process parts as they're received instead?
[11:55:35] <taplar> what do you mean?
[11:55:37] <Stutters> Those parts arrive with a delay
[11:56:03] <Stutters> @taplar: It's basically a progress bar response. How many % that progress bar should be displaying right now.
[11:56:27] <taplar> yeah, there's a way to do that, but it's a different kind of request
[11:56:29] <Stutters> Right now jquery collects all the data and processes it all at once
[11:56:54] <taplar> what you're talking about is handling a chucked ajax request, iirc
[11:57:20] <Stutters> More like chucked ajax response probably, but yes. Where can I find more information on that?
[12:00:01] <taplar> from what i'm reading, some articles are saying that the success method will only fire once the request is done
[12:00:31] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10753725/jquery-support-transfer-encodingchunked-how
[12:00:37] <Stutters> GRAAAAH... So no upload progress and file processing progress for me with jquery?
[12:00:59] <taplar> so you may have to grab the xhr off of it to add an event handler to it for it receiving data, or swap to a basic xhr and do the same
[12:01:43] <Stutters> I see, so back to the roots I guess.
[12:01:53] <Stutters> Thank you very much! I couldn't find anything about that :/
[12:02:11] <Stutters> #googleFuTooWeak
[12:02:25] <taplar> i was thinking ajax had an option that would fire as data came in, but i was mistaken, :(
[12:04:15] <Stutters> I expected it to have one as well :|
[12:05:39] <Stutters> Thanks!
[12:11:10] <jquery136> http://jsfiddle.net/grLuk1m6/3/     im having problems with the validation...you can just type in the username and it'll post =/
[12:11:39] <jquery136> must be something wrong with my jquery but it looks fine and ive checked it multiple times
[12:16:31] <jquery136> i get this error in my console a.validator.methods[d] is undefined
[12:17:40] <jquery136> sorry i did it :)
[12:17:48] <taplar> got it?
[12:17:56] * taplar is browsing while muching
[12:18:05] <taplar> *munching
[12:18:56] <jquery136> yep removed username: true and password: true... thank you
[12:19:10] <taplar> hey, that was all you, ^_^
[14:38:52] <taplar> bop bop bop bop
[14:39:06] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[15:13:59] <webdude_> what is the jquery equivalent to "~" in css? I'm basically trying to write "this ~ ul" but I'm not sure how.
[15:14:46] <robertmaxrees> sibling selector?
[15:15:02] <webdude_> yes
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> the method version would be $(this).siblings()
[15:15:11] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[15:17:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:17:54] <webdude_> ah cool, thanks
[15:28:06] <Fr0stBit> Hi guys i have a question... Why this loop keeps on forever? https://github.com/caseif/vis.js/blob/gh-pages/js/visual/gui.js#L99
[15:28:35] <Fr0stBit> Shouldn't .scrollWidth value change after setting the new font-size?
[15:29:46] <taplar> the browser has to be given a chance to redraw
[15:30:52] <Fr0stBit> And how can i overcome this issue?
[15:31:11] <taplar> you could introduce some delay with a setTimeout
[15:32:03] <taplar> call method -> if conditional true -> change stuff -> setTimeout to call same method 200 milliseconds later
[15:32:37] <robertmaxrees> that might looks a little strange though.
[15:32:40] <robertmaxrees> *look
[15:33:12] <taplar> oh?
[15:33:31] <robertmaxrees> imagine that container resizing every 1/5th of a second.
[15:33:43] <taplar> ooooh, i thought you were talking about the logic
[15:33:45] <robertmaxrees> or rather, the funt.
[15:33:50] <robertmaxrees> *font
[15:35:43] <Fr0stBit> can't i use something less time based?
[15:36:20] <robertmaxrees> why are you changing the font sizes like that in the first place?
[15:38:53] <Fr0stBit> robertmaxrees: Not my code, just trying to patch it up and fixit.. As far as i can see the commit history he is trying to make a pixel perfect fit for the font size
[15:39:10] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:39:29] <robertmaxrees> so you're editing library code directly?
[15:40:21] <Fr0stBit> robertmaxrees: No its just a fork of a page, although the name of the project seems a lot like a library
[15:40:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:11:36] <Haystack78> Has anyone here ever ran into a problem where if a user copies text from Microsoft Word to a form, a small anchor icon (actual pic of a boat anchor) shows up in the pasted text?
[17:11:52] <robertmaxrees> doesn't sound familiar.
[17:12:14] <Haystack78> I can't re-create the problem and can't find anything about it on the net
[17:12:47] <Haystack78> just hoping maybe someone here has ran into the same problem
[17:14:39] <taplar> ◄ doesn't see an ascii character for an anchor
[17:15:02] <taplar> ☺
[17:17:27] <robhol> Haystack78: some windows apps decide to get "clever" with the clipboard. a workaround is to take something dirt simple like notepad, paste it in, and then copy it from there. There may also be a Word feature like "copy as plain text", thinking about it
[17:18:14] <robhol> otherwise you'd need to handle it specifically when pasting, if that's even possible, which means you'll need to sleuth a bit and figure out what the anchor actually is :p
[17:18:14] <taplar> well the weirdness is that if you are pasting into a form, it should typically only show ascii characters
[17:18:45] <taplar> unless you're using some plugin for a wysiwyg
[17:24:57] <Haystack78> thanks guys
[17:25:03] <Haystack78> we're using tinymce
[17:25:22] <taplar> yeah, weirdness will ensue with that
[17:26:43] <Haystack78> if only I could re-create the problem.  I even got a hold of the word doc they were using and tried it on my end, no anchor
[17:28:10] <Haystack78> apparently in word, the achor has to do with graphic images, and there are no graphics in the document, which is even weirder
[17:36:06] <boblamont> I have three different javascript-based functions of my wordpress site that work as expected in android Chrome, but not android Firefox or android default browser... is there something I should be looking for to figure out what's going wrong?
