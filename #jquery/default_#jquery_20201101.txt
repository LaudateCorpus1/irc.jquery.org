[00:15:12] <ChicagoNathan> I have a question - if using ajax to update some content, the links in the updated content appear to not be bound to my click events.  This is pretty redacted, but I think you can understand the issue from it: https://jsfiddle.net/dxbmgho0/
[00:15:43] <ChicagoNathan> I can click the button once and it works great, but when it is refreshed and you try to click it again and it doesn't work.
[00:15:56] <ChicagoNathan> Is there a simple way to re-bind the links after updating the content?
[00:15:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, event handlers can only bind to elements that exist at the time you call them.
[00:16:04] <robertmaxrees> you need to use event delegation instead :)

[00:16:20] <ChicagoNathan> Thanks Robert.
[00:17:13] <robertmaxrees> these two explain the basics - don't just skip to the first example on that first link since that's an example of a direct event listener, which isn't what you want.
[00:20:57] <ChicagoNathan> I already implemented it.  Worked like a charm
[00:20:59] <ChicagoNathan> Thanks so much.
