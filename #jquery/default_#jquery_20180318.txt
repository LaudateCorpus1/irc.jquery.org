[00:08:53] <GeekMonkey> https://github.com/camwiegert/in-view I am using this inview library.... a script I am using is using another inview library... I would rather not switch it out
[00:09:06] <GeekMonkey> can someone help me adjust my code
[00:09:47] <GeekMonkey> https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/c4c5738135759f982efedec613afa03b
[00:09:53] <GeekMonkey> line 17-19 of the js
[00:10:08] <GeekMonkey> probably wont need the function that it is calling
[01:24:18] <jak2000> anyone worked with java?
[08:06:58] <berz3rk> hey guys
[08:07:13] <rockwood> hello
[08:07:23] <berz3rk> anyone here ever used golden layout or w2ui? I try to load a w2ui layout into a golden layout widget but w2ui just doesnt want to load... .w2layout() is not a function is the result anyone had experience??
[08:08:30] <berz3rk> this is basicly typescript, but it does the exact same in javascript https://github.com/gotwig/StuffThatGetsRemoved/blob/v2/src/editor/editor.ts#L100 -> the error happens here ->  Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: $(...).w2layout is not a function     at Layout.build (layout.ts:61)     at new Editor (editor.ts:123)     at index-debug.html:191     at <anonymous> :  https://github.com/gotwig/StuffThatGetsRemoved/blob/v2/src/editor/gui/
[08:09:14] <berz3rk> when I remove new Goldenlayout line from edtitor.ts it works , when i add it back I get .w2layout is not a function...
[08:09:26] <berz3rk> both have their respective containers
[08:10:45] <berz3rk> how come they both mess with another?
[10:18:36] <hassoon> 'sup
[11:30:35] <berz3rk> nvm guys it wasnt jquery
[11:30:38] <berz3rk> its shitty UMD
[15:05:23] <jpp`> Hi, is this the right channel to ask basic jQuery questions? Or is there a better one I should use?
[15:14:09] <shoky_> jpp`: this is it
