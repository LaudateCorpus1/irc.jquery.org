[06:21:32] <Woet> what is your jquery question?
[06:21:37] <Woet> and how does "view demo source" not help you?
[06:21:41] <Woet> https://www.amcharts.com/lib/3/maps/js/usaLow.js
[06:22:48] <neo_> my question ?
[06:23:07] <neo_> Woet , I need do this using jQuery https://www.amcharts.com/demos/us-heat-map/?theme=none
[06:23:07] <Woet> your -> jquery <- question.
[06:23:11] <Woet> ok, go ahead.
[06:23:16] <neo_> Woet, how to do this map ?
[06:23:21] <Woet> [12:21:36]  <Woet>	and how does "view demo source" not help you?
[06:23:41] <neo_> I bad know css
[06:23:45] <neo_> and html
[06:23:58] <neo_> Woet ,there seem SVG maybe used ?
[06:24:24] <Woet> [12:21:40]  <Woet>	https://www.amcharts.com/lib/3/maps/js/usaLow.js
[06:24:28] <Woet> are you even reading or am I talking to a wall?
[06:35:56] <neo_> yes
[06:36:07] <neo_> I was little busy
[06:36:50] <neo_> what there ?
[06:37:00] <neo_> Woet, I bad understand :(
[06:37:57] <Woet> neo_: then I can't help you.
[06:39:20] <neo_> Woet, what need use to create that map ?
[06:39:31] <Woet> neo_: basic knowledge of html, css and js.
[06:48:02] <neo_> I have basic knowlage
[06:48:20] <Woet> you aren't demonstrating it
[06:48:22] <neo_> Woet, know tags p html and styles

[08:38:42] <neo_> I see my button sooner doesn't work
[08:38:59] <neo_> I press button and nothing happen
[08:47:43] <lowbro> neo_: your button might be broken. jQuery works on mobile
[08:48:24] <neo_> yes, all work, I'm confused
[11:37:52] <neo_> in this chatroon always silence
[11:38:02] <taplar> only recently
[11:38:06] <neo_> maybe all speak in privet
[11:38:19] <taplar> no, just no one asking questions
[11:39:22] <neo_> all without questions
[11:40:07] <neo_> I have question
[11:40:34] <taplar> ask away
[11:40:47] <neo_> about how created this map https://www.amcharts.com/demos/us-heat-map/?theme=none
[11:41:35] <neo_> on stackowerflow people say me need use svg maybe and use google https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45188243/how-create-a-map-for-country-with-highlight-areas
[11:41:38] <taplar> no clue.  looks like it is an svg thing
[11:41:55] <neo_> and this possibly learn for two days and create it ?
[11:41:59] <taplar> that's more of a html question
[11:42:08] <neo_> I can create it from ground up for 2 days ?
[11:42:13] <neo_> I dont' know svg
[11:42:20] <taplar> nor do i
[11:42:33] <neo_> it means not ?
[11:42:37] <taplar> but either way, as it is more of a html question, it's of topic for the room
[11:42:46] <taplar> *off
[11:43:05] <neo_> before I encountered with svg , there was little Icon and it's was so difficult and I couldn't do that task
[11:43:17] <neo_> ok
[11:45:11] <neo_> is svg popular thing ?
[11:45:26] <neo_> it's worth learn ?
[11:45:38] <taplar> it's growing in popularity i believe
[12:52:42] <Braden`> Hello!
[12:52:44] <Braden`> How do I create a function in JQuery that works just like a Javascript function?  For example (in js):  function myFunc(parm1, parm2) { ...
[12:57:05] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:57:12] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[12:57:21] <robertmaxrees> Braden`
[12:57:35] <robertmaxrees> so your question is kind of odd.  what's the problem you're running into?
[12:59:15] <Braden`> robertmaxrees:  I am inside of the ready() function of JS, and I am wanting some way to call a function and pass parms.  If it can be done in a jquery way, that would be great.
[12:59:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:59:50] <robertmaxrees> you mean $(document).ready()?
[13:01:06] <robertmaxrees> either way, jQuery IS javascript, so there's no difference in how functions work.
[13:03:46] <taplar_lunch> i wonder if he's hitting scoping issues and is confuddled
[13:04:07] <robertmaxrees> good point.  Braden` could you share your code via bpaste or something?
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[13:06:14] <EastFlow> lol browsers dumb... I have an html page pulling in code that leads to a php page with some parameters then when a button is pushed on that page the parameters are fed into a second php page in an iframe window in a fancybox modal.. and then a user enters in payment details.. on firefox in a private window a get a jquery ajax fails message when posting the payment.. but in chrome private window ajax does not fail
[13:06:48] <EastFlow> .... this is all so dumb.. I hade dealing with php/javascript hybrid based payments
[13:08:06] <taplar> php shouldn't really be an issue, so long as the request is being made the same
[13:08:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:08:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd look at what the ajax failure is.
[13:09:10] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 times when i see an error like that it's because I'm doing something weird.
[13:51:09] <orbyt_> I'm looking at some code that uses `$('#my-element').each(function() {` and thens has a bunch of code in the handler that references `$(this)`. However, there's only one `#my-element`, so i would like to remove the call to `.each`.
[13:51:19] <orbyt_> What's the easiest way to replace this?
[13:52:18] <robertmaxrees> easy: declare a var that stores the result of that selector, then take the body of the funcion out of the each and replace all calls to $(this) with that var.
[13:54:03] <orbyt_> Yea that would work. I suppose I was thinking of something along the lines of (pseudo code) $('#my-element').with(function() {}) or something
[13:54:16] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> not needed.
[13:54:34] <orbyt_> There's nothing like that?
[13:54:36] <orbyt_> Hmm.
[13:54:41] <robertmaxrees> why would there be?
[13:54:50] <robertmaxrees> that would be super confusing
[13:54:52] <orbyt_> Dunno, figured I'd ask.
[13:55:43] <taplar> technically you could do a .call
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> how?
[13:56:17] <taplar> function(){}.call($(thatGuy)) no?
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[13:56:45] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you COULD do something like that, buit I'd avoid it;
[13:56:49] <taplar> :)
[13:57:27] <orbyt_> Ah, and then `this` inside the function would refer to the jQuery object I assume.
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> it would, but thjere's literally no reason to do it that way.
[13:57:52] <orbyt_> Yea, that's not too pretty, but interesting nonetheless.
[13:58:00] <orbyt_> üëç
[14:02:17] <orbyt_> Follow up question. Inside that previous $('#my-element').each() function that i'm now replacing, there was the following: https://pastebin.com/c8ZmMEeB
[14:02:44] <orbyt_> Do the two comments $(this) values refer to $('#my-element')?
[14:02:58] <orbyt_> Or since they are inside they're own anonymous functions, do they refer to something local?
[14:03:07] <robertmaxrees> line 6 is the current .select-style.active
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> *they're in functions, period.,
[14:03:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery generally sets 'this' to the current active element.
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> "active" meaning "the one it's working on right now"
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> line 10 would be the clicked element.
[14:04:42] <orbyt_> Ah, so it sounds like when factoring out the previous .each into it's own variable, I should leave these "internal" `$(this)` statements alone
[14:04:45] <Braden`> robertmaxrees:  My apologies for the delayed response
[14:05:07] <robertmaxrees> orbyt_ for any functions, yeah.
[14:05:14] <orbyt_> Cool üëç. Thank you.
[14:05:29] <robertmaxrees> Braden` all good
[14:06:16] <Braden`> Can a normal js function be created inside of $(document).ready()?  Or, should I put my script at the bottom of my page so that I do not need the $(document).ready() block?
[14:06:34] <robertmaxrees> Braden` again, jQuery IS javascript.
[14:06:48] <robertmaxrees> so your whole line of thinking doesn't make sense :)
[14:06:48] <Braden`> Right, but I didn't know if its allowed while nested
[14:07:03] <robertmaxrees> erm, what do you think a jQuery function is?
[14:07:06] <robertmaxrees> how would it differ?
[14:07:41] <Braden`> So, I could do:  (document).ready() { function blah() { .. ?
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> that'
[14:08:34] <robertmaxrees> *that isn't how you use document ready.
[14:08:51] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ready(function() { /* your code here */ });
[14:11:13] <robertmaxrees> but it's all javascript.
[14:11:40] <robertmaxrees> so i dunno how you it would prevent you from using a function like you could anywhere else in the language.
[14:14:07] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[14:21:39] <taplar> lol, double welp
[14:22:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:02:08] <catbadger> LAMP.
[16:04:51] <taplar> bright idea
[16:06:50] <catbadger> LAMP > MEAN.
[16:06:52] <catbadger> lol
[16:06:57] <catbadger> LAPP > LAMP
[16:07:06] <EastFlow> hahahaha LAMP = S-H-I-T
[16:07:24] <catbadger> EastFlow defend your argument
[16:07:26] <catbadger> ;)
[16:07:38] <taplar> in PM please
[16:08:00] <catbadger> lol yeah sorry taplar.
[16:08:06] <catbadger> I was just stirring the pot
[16:08:08] <catbadger> ;)
[16:10:02] <EastFlow> catbadger: i mean i'd still prefer lemp over lamp.. because nginx>apache
[16:10:21] <catbadger> ew. no. just no.
[16:10:29] <catbadger> ngix is so gross as a server.
[16:10:34] <catbadger> great proxy tho
[16:10:52] <taplar> again, if you want to have a discussion about something OT please take it to PM
[16:12:02] <catbadger> sorry man. my bad.
[16:12:40] <EastFlow> how is everyone enjoying the callback hell known as jquery... any better alternatives to deal with painfully long spaghettti strands of callbacks?
[16:13:08] <taplar> never had callback hell personally
[16:14:42] <EastFlow> I've heard of using 'promises' with some type of 'async promisse wrapper' but have yet to implement such a thing, I just try to disable async wherever possible
[16:14:43] <catbadger> EastFlow Promises.
[16:14:56] <catbadger> lol promises are babytime simple in jquery
[16:14:58] <catbadger> when then
[16:15:06] <catbadger> simple.
[16:16:11] <EastFlow> lol I guess I am a jquery baby.. I'd like to think of myself more as a jquery paperclip/ductape fixer.. but I don't think I've ever written pure and clean jquery
[16:17:04] <taplar> 'async promise wrapper' ?
[16:18:58] <EastFlow> here you go: https://jsfiddle.net/5yd4bomr/
[16:19:26] <EastFlow> Many times we don‚Äôt have the luxury to change the way our async functions work inside. But we are not on the losing side! What we can do is to wrap the async function with the one which uses promises
[16:19:32] <taplar> ah, usually that's not necessary
[16:20:03] <taplar> what are you calling an async function?
[16:20:31] <taplar> something in a timeout?  or something involving an $.ajax call?
[16:20:45] <EastFlow> I assumed an ajax call
[16:21:04] <taplar> ajax returns a promise/deferred.  usually you don't need to create one yourself
[16:21:14] <taplar> just return $.ajax(....)
[16:21:41] <EastFlow> but something in a timeout won't return a promise?
[16:21:55] <taplar> timeout's don't "return" normally
[16:22:11] <taplar> the return of a timeout is a reference to that timeout
[16:22:52] <taplar> creating a promise for that case could be useful
[16:23:03] <taplar> or if you have an ajax endpoint that returns errors as a 200 response
[16:23:26] <taplar> in that case you'd also probably want to create your own deferred, to let the outside know if the 200 response was actually good/bad
[16:23:49] <EastFlow> haha that spulds like some good ole janky duct tape fix to me
[16:24:02] <taplar> it's all catoring to peoples tastes
[16:24:06] <EastFlow> sounds* not spulds*
[16:24:14] <taplar> some people think you should return a 200 if the request was good
[16:24:19] <taplar> not if the logic was good
[16:26:40] <EastFlow> if status code>=400 and less than 500 you fucked up
[16:26:56] <EastFlow> if status code >=500 then I fucked up
[16:27:23] <taplar> 404 could be you fked up
[16:27:30] <taplar> maybe your logic to find the resource is dorked
[16:27:52] <taplar> hard to make blanket statements
[16:28:03] <EastFlow> agreed
[16:37:33] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[16:43:45] <bilb_ono> Can someone explain what I am doing wrong in this file upload? https://bpaste.net/show/0154cf534ca6
[16:43:55] <bilb_ono> It is logging ‚Äújquery‚Äù so the jquery library is loading
[16:44:13] <bilb_ono> however, when I upload a file with the button, id never logs data.result.files
[16:44:19] <bilb_ono> so I assume its never actually "done"
[16:44:49] <bilb_ono> do I need to do something special on the server so that its ‚Äúdone‚Äù?
[16:46:01] <taplar> when does the fileupload() trigger?
[16:47:26] <bilb_ono> taplar: I think when you add an image with the <input> html tag
[16:47:31] <bilb_ono> I am going off of this: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[16:47:52] <robertmaxrees> bilb_ono and you have that element, right?
[16:48:11] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: yep it looks like <input id="fileupload" type="file" name="files[]" data-url="server/php/" multiple>
[16:48:23] <robertmaxrees> also: try adding a fail in there.
[16:48:35] <bilb_ono> what would that look like?
[16:48:38] <bilb_ono> just named fail?
[16:48:43] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options#fail
[16:48:49] <robertmaxrees> you already have a done: function
[16:49:08] <robertmaxrees> fail is pretty similar.
[16:50:53] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: like this? https://bpaste.net/show/5f49816e7b8d
[16:51:05] <bilb_ono> it doesn‚Äôt log anything - except jquery
[16:51:13] <bilb_ono> so I guess that means the .fileupload isn‚Äôt being called?
[16:51:17] <bilb_ono> or the fail isn‚Äôt being called?
[16:51:38] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab and make sure those files are actually loading.
[16:52:07] <bilb_ono> oh they say 304
[16:52:11] <bilb_ono> is that bad?
[16:52:20] <robertmaxrees> that means not modified.
[16:52:48] <taplar> maybe try clearing cache and try again
[16:53:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:54:27] <bilb_ono> so after clearing the cache, those files get a 200 error
[16:54:36] <bilb_ono> however, still nothing is logging in the console
[16:54:48] <robertmaxrees> 200 isn't an error.
[16:54:54] <robertmaxrees> and are you getting any console errors?
[16:54:56] <bilb_ono> sorry response
[16:55:01] <bilb_ono> no, it just says jquery
[16:55:05] <bilb_ono> which I logged
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($.fn.fileupload)
[16:55:56] <robertmaxrees> right aftere that jquery console log.
[16:56:31] <robertmaxrees> also: is the page reloading or anything like that after you submit?
[16:57:04] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: it logs https://bpaste.net/show/453cd8e52c78
[16:57:09] <bilb_ono> doesn‚Äôt seem to be
[16:57:32] <bilb_ono> but the outline of the div seems to turn blue for some reason
[16:58:02] <robertmaxrees> dunno then. maybe try dropping to an earlier version of jqueryu and see if it goes away?
[16:58:09] <robertmaxrees> the most recent in the 1.x or 2.x line.
[16:59:21] <taplar> also can you show us that fileupload html markup?
[16:59:43] <taplar> i'm assuming it has to have something on it to know where to upload the file to
[16:59:44] <bilb_ono> hmm jquery 2.1 seems to have the same result
[17:00:14] <bilb_ono> Im concerned with the data-url="server/php/" thing. idk where it thinks that is, but im def not using php
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:00:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:00:28] <bilb_ono> the html markup is literally just this: <input id="fileupload" type="file" name="files[]" data-url="server/php/" multiple>
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> sooo did you read the docs at all or are you just expecting this to work?
[17:01:32] <robertmaxrees> because this won't really work out of the box.  gotta point it to a legit UIRL.
[17:02:51] <bilb_ono> oh
[17:02:57] <bilb_ono> I guess I expected it to just work
[17:03:10] <bilb_ono> so I need to point data-url to a route on my server
[17:03:17] <bilb_ono> and then what should I return in that server route?
[17:03:54] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:03:57] <robertmaxrees> what do the docs say?
[17:04:36] <robertmaxrees> dollars to donuts that information is in there.
[17:18:44] <robertmaxrees> bilb_ono you find it?
[17:19:11] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: no. I am looking through this app to see how they do it: https://github.com/ngoduykhanh/flask-file-uploader/
[17:19:16] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:19:21] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs on the repo.
[17:19:27] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Setup#using-jquery-file-upload-ui-version-with-a-custom-server-side-upload-handler
[17:19:58] <bilb_ono> ah ok
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> that's why i mentioned checking out the docs heh
[17:39:10] <jyg> I'm making an AJAX call, which is returning. I trace the execution up to .done() , I can see the 200 OK and the response data in the network tab of the browser's tools, but the break point just inside .done() never is reached
[17:39:34] <robertmaxrees> code?
[17:39:36] <robertmaxrees> and example data?
[17:39:52] <jyg> I can't show the data... but I can put up some code
[17:40:03] <robertmaxrees> can you mock the data format at least?
[17:42:10] <jyg> Not sure what part of the code you'd want to see.  I mean the only pertinent part is the  $.ajax(url).done( function(data) {
[17:42:25] <robertmaxrees> the format of the data is also pertinent.
[17:42:26] <taplar> wut?
[17:42:57] <taplar> oh snap, ajax does have a url only version
[17:43:00] <jyg> Not questioning you request, I just want to understand why the format of the data will help?
[17:43:14] <robertmaxrees> because it could be a format that jquery doesn't understand.
[17:43:19] <taplar> what's the content type of the response?
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> or otherwise malformed.
[17:43:21] <jyg> it's JSON
[17:43:25] <taplar> in the header?
[17:43:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah check the content type header and the response code.
[17:43:56] <robertmaxrees> you can also try the .fail() method and poke around for the error message.
[17:44:08] <jyg> gotcha, wouldn't JS complain?
[17:44:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:44:17] <jyg> AH, duh, thank you!
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> jquery tries to protect you as much as possible.
[17:44:36] <jyg> let me poke around with fail() before I pull the data out
[17:44:40] <robertmaxrees> well, unless it's really broken, in which case the engine will complain.
[17:44:59] <taplar> should be a quick check to see what the content type is on the response header
[17:45:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:45:37] <jyg> taplar, I did... it *looked* fine, but that was a quick inspection
[17:45:46] <taplar> lol, no man
[17:45:47] <jyg> all splayed out in one line of course
[17:45:55] <taplar> does it say "Content-Type: application/json" ?
[17:45:55] <jyg> ok bbiaf
[17:45:59] <jyg> yes
[17:46:04] <taplar> k
[17:46:26] <taplar> then you could change it to $.ajax({ url: url, dataType: 'text' }) and see if anything changes
[17:46:48] <jyg> which might let it pass through and then my own code will blow heh
[17:47:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:47:03] <taplar> sure, but if that works, then that suggests what robert was talking about with malformed data
[17:47:09] <robertmaxrees> but it IS a way to verify the data
[17:47:10] <jyg> well the type is set by something magical in a controller outside of js... let me check fail
[17:47:22] <jyg> ok bbias
[17:47:41] * taplar hums killing me softly
[17:48:04] <taplar> one time, one time
[17:50:55] <jyg> "parsererror"  :)
[17:51:15] <taplar> so invalid json
[17:51:17] <jyg> something must've change in the controller's JSON repsonse preparation
[17:51:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:52:07] <taplar> what's the backend?
[17:52:16] <jyg> Symfony 3
[17:52:30] <robertmaxrees> you're not building your own json, right?
[17:52:31] <jyg> I'm converting from 2 to 3. This is the last piece of the puzzle
[17:52:36] <jyg> heck no
[17:52:40] <taplar> php
[17:52:47] <taplar> so you're doing json_encode i assume
[17:53:08] <taplar> *would
[17:53:48] <jyg> taplar, yes ... somewhere along the line that happens.  It's at a higher level than that. It's centered around an object which builds a response, JSON based for REST consumption , rather than Symfony's standard page response
[17:54:47] <taplar> ok.  well, however you are building the response array, typically you'd json_encode it at the very end to ensure valid json data returned
[17:54:56] <jyg> Thanks for pointing me in the right direction  within the pit of the jQuery's initially terse result
[17:55:26] <robertmaxrees> technically
[17:55:30] <jyg> taplar, I am sure that's what it's doing... someone somewhere in the world who maintains what this things does broke something... I'll fix it.
[17:55:43] <robertmaxrees> when using deferreds, you have to be explicit about what you want.
[17:55:57] <robertmaxrees> also: try .then() instead of .done()
[17:56:01] <robertmaxrees> and .catch() instead of .fail()
[17:56:16] <robertmaxrees> since It's Better That Way‚Ñ¢
[17:56:26] <taplar> i would hope if one of the developers broke returning valid json that not only you'd be causing a stink, and it'd be something -they- would be patching
[17:57:09] <jyg> more like i'd fix it submit a pull request
[17:57:16] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[17:57:31] <jyg> heh
[17:57:32] <taplar> it's open source?
[17:57:37] <robertmaxrees> open sores
[17:57:39] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:57:44] <jyg> wow
[17:58:07] <jyg> yes, Symfony3 and everything publicly available for it is open source
[17:58:15] <taplar> ah
[17:59:11] <jyg> funny that robertmaxrees says that
[17:59:17] <jyg> i mena, jquery is open source...
[17:59:19] <jyg> mean
[17:59:39] <taplar> i'm assuming it was more about you having to fix the issue and not that they are aware of it
[17:59:53] <taplar> if it has issues returning valid json, that's kinda a big bug
[17:59:58] <jyg> lol wtf...
[17:59:58] <jyg> i{"updates":{"0":{"data":"{\n
[18:00:11] <jyg> i really should wear my glass all the time hah
[18:00:17] <taplar> ?
[18:00:22] <jyg> that leading 'i'
[18:00:34] <taplar> yeah, that's a problem
[18:00:42] <jyg> just a bit heh
[18:01:15] <jyg> what's funny is when I first installed Symfony3 and was loading up the default app's pages, I was seeing this 'i' at the front of every <body>
[18:01:32] <jyg> i must have inadvertnelty type an i somewhere in some config file
[18:01:33] <taplar> :s
[18:01:34] <jyg> lol
[18:01:58] <jyg> omg this is going to be horrible to search for hah
[18:03:31] <jyg> when i first put this software up, before I made a project in my idea, i was editing in VI
[18:03:51] <jyg> i must've went to [i]nsert and hit 'i' twice ... this is ridiculous hah
[18:03:57] <taplar> lol
[18:04:57] <jyg> oh I bet its infront of an  <?php  ... right at the start of a file
[18:05:59] <jyg> yep search for 'i<?php' and sure enough ... lol  works perfectly now!
[18:06:08] <taplar> cool
[18:06:09] <jyg> Thanks again taplar and robertmaxrees
[18:21:07] <robertmaxrees> and that, kids, is why the data format is pertinent
[19:11:58] <fiord> hey everyone
[19:14:42] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[19:15:33] <fiord> how's life today?
[19:16:31] <robertmaxrees> it's okay.
[19:41:18] <fiord> Well, hopefully it gets better than okay as the day goes on.
[19:41:49] <robertmaxrees> ahaha
[19:41:53] <robertmaxrees> it's already 4:40
[19:42:20] <robertmaxrees> though I am excited to get home and play around with my guitar gear.
[19:42:42] <fiord> Nice! Something to look forward to. It's nearly 9pm here. Work day finished a couple hours ago.
[19:42:48] <robertmaxrees> nice
[19:43:22] <fiord> What kinda guitar do you play?
[19:43:57] <robertmaxrees> kind of a broad question haha.  all kinds.
[19:44:04] <robertmaxrees> acoustic, electric, tons of genres.
[19:45:45] <fiord> Originally I meant what particular model of guitar, but that's cool to know, too!
[19:46:20] <robertmaxrees> i have a few.  mostly fender stuff.  my main axe is an American Series Strat.
[19:46:41] <robertmaxrees> also have a tele copy with an aria neck and gibson humbuckers and an old prodigy 2
[19:47:05] <fiord> Nice. I've got a few as well. An old Yamaha that I have in pieces and am in the process of rebuilding, an SG as my main electric, and an Art & Lutherie acoustic.
[19:47:48] <robertmaxrees> neat. i did a retube and bias on my twin last night so I'm interested to keep screwing around and tweak it a little more
[19:49:20] <fiord> Oh awesome! Last piece of gear I got was a plain old footswitch for my amp, and was dismayed to find out that the channel switching jack is messed up. Works fine to switch the reverb on and off, but it won't switch the channels. Have to get it looked at since I'm pretty in the dark about rewiring.
[19:49:48] <robertmaxrees> what's the amp?
[19:50:45] <fiord> A little Traynor Reverb Mate. Nothing special, but I haven't been in a gigging situation in a long time, and live in an apartment building so big noise is not desirable.
[19:50:59] <bilb_ono> when I use an input tag in a form, after I upload the file, it shows me the filename. I want to edit what it shows. How can I do this? like $(document).ready(function(){$('photo-upload').attr('name', function(‚Äòname‚Äô){return name+‚Äôand the end of it‚Äô;});
[19:51:03] <bilb_ono> does that make sense?
[19:51:17] <bilb_ono> I don‚Äôt want to show the filename, I want to show the full filepath basically
[19:51:35] <robertmaxrees> bilb_ono so you want to edit the name attribute?
[19:51:45] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to add something to the name?
[19:52:41] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: yeah right now it shows. ‚Äòtest-image.jpg‚Äô next to the choose file button. I want it to show [test-file.jpg]!(https://www.mywebsite.com/images/test-image.jpg)
[19:52:55] <bilb_ono> so that I can quickly copy it and add it to a blog post basically
[19:53:21] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle or something?
[19:54:01] <robertmaxrees> also: do you have multiples of this input?
[19:54:04] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jmnzkj0r/
[19:54:25] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what you've tried?
[19:54:50] <robertmaxrees> (so i can help you learn instead of just doing it for you :) )
[19:55:01] <bilb_ono> https://jsfiddle.net/jmnzkj0r/1/
[19:55:10] <bilb_ono> wait
[19:55:42] <bilb_ono> https://jsfiddle.net/jmnzkj0r/2/
[19:56:16] <robertmaxrees> okay so coupla things: 1. you weren't including jquery
[19:56:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jmnzkj0r/3/
[19:56:39] <robertmaxrees> this fixes that. 2. $('photo-upload input') will never select anything.  do you mean $('#photo-upload input') ?
[19:56:57] <bilb_ono> yeah sorry.
[19:57:29] <bilb_ono> hmm I always wondered how you included jquery in there
[19:57:30] <robertmaxrees> 3: why change the name attribute?  kind of weird if you want to be able to easily copy/paste the value.
[19:57:43] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: its for markdown format
[19:57:54] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/vRXb38W.png fwiw
[19:58:07] <robertmaxrees> bilb_ono right, but why the name attribute?  why not display it somewhere else?
[19:58:11] <bilb_ono> in markdown you write images like ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
[19:58:30] <robertmaxrees> i know what markdown is - i'm not asking about the value, i'm questioning the use of the name attribute to hold this info.
[19:59:08] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: oh sorry, yeah, if it appeared elsewhere that would be fine too. But I don‚Äôt really understand the process by which that name is populated to begin with
[19:59:39] <robertmaxrees> it's really supposed to be a sort of... static value.
[19:59:41] <bilb_ono> so, if I was not using that, what would the process be? would my server have to get involved again?
[19:59:45] <robertmaxrees> right now on pageload it's "files"
[19:59:52] <robertmaxrees> erm, i'm way lost.
[20:00:06] <robertmaxrees> are you returning info about the file after it's been uploaded?
[20:00:58] <bilb_ono> sorry, Im not explaining this well. I am trying to make a personal blog website where I write blog articles in markdown. 1 painpoint is always going and googling the markdown image format, copy and pasting it, and formatting the url.
[20:01:20] <bilb_ono> to get around this, I want to make something that , when I upload the file, shows me what I need to put in the markdown for the file to show up
[20:01:37] <robertmaxrees> are you uploading the files via ajax?
[20:01:39] <bilb_ono> currently, I have a route on the server which handles uploads by saving the file that was put in there
[20:01:54] <bilb_ono> no, just an html form
[20:02:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd have your server return that info, then.
[20:02:21] <robertmaxrees> setting the name attribute before the form posts doesn't really make much sense.
[20:02:32] <bilb_ono> right now I have https://bpaste.net/show/d87fdf8b3077
[20:02:59] <bilb_ono> robertmaxrees: the trouble is, if I return that string, then it just shows that string in the browser
[20:02:59] <robertmaxrees> looks like python, yeah?
[20:03:04] <bilb_ono> yep
[20:03:11] <robertmaxrees> isn't that what you want tho?  the string?
[20:03:24] <bilb_ono> what I want is no redirect, just adding a little blurb below my photo input with the proper formatted markdown image link
[20:03:36] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaahhh.
[20:03:45] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need ajax.
[20:03:47] <bilb_ono> yeah the redirect is the problem
[20:03:50] <bilb_ono> oh
[20:03:54] <bilb_ono> for which part of this?
[20:03:58] <bilb_ono> for the photo upload?
[20:04:02] <robertmaxrees> well, you have 2 choices.
[20:04:39] <robertmaxrees> 1: you make the photo upload ajax or 2: when the user is "redirected" (when you submit the form) you render back out that page with that info displayed somewhere.
[20:05:22] <robertmaxrees> you can't simply stop the page from going to the form post url.
[20:05:26] <robertmaxrees> unless you use ajax.
[20:06:49] <bilb_ono> hmm I like
[20:06:50] <bilb_ono> 1
[20:07:00] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to setup ajax image uploading.
[22:45:39] <masterasia> Why doesn't this work on the second click? https://jsfiddle.net/jshuLmx0/2/
[22:45:43] <masterasia> It is driving me nuts
