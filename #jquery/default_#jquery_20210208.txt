[15:12:08] <onizu> hello
[15:12:21] <robertmaxrees> o/
[15:12:55] <onizu> I'm not able to capture the .prop('checked') of a checkbox in the .click(function() {}) of a button
[15:13:26] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty vague description of the issue.  could you maybe make a jsfiddle to show the problem?
[15:14:44] <onizu> the .prop('checked') capture works when I do it outside the .click() of the button, as $('input#checkboxId').change(function() { if('input#checkboxId').prop('checkbox') {...} } );
[15:15:36] <robertmaxrees> that code doesn't look valid, so fixing that would be my first suggestion.
[15:16:06] <onizu> what part?
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> if('input#checkboxId').prop('checkbox') {...} }
[15:17:06] <onizu> what's invalid there?
[15:17:20] <onizu> oh sorry
[15:17:29] <onizu> typo.. it should be .prop('checked')
[15:17:37] <robertmaxrees> still not valid
[15:17:53] <onizu> why?
[15:17:56] <robertmaxrees> should be if ($('#checkboxId').prop('checked')) {
[15:18:33] <onizu> if ($('input#checkboxId').prop('checked')) { ... yes, sorry made a lot of typos
[15:18:45] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what about it isn't working?
[15:19:35] <onizu> this "if" condition does not turn true when I check the check box and hit the submit button
[15:19:59] <robertmaxrees> okay well https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/75w3tv4x/1/
[15:20:39] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: based on your description of the bug, everything should work fine.  it sounds like there are some details I don't have.
[15:20:47] <robertmaxrees> mind expanding on that test case a little?
[15:21:54] <onizu> will it allow me to save that code and share?
[15:22:02] <onizu> after editing
[15:22:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.  make your edits, press the save button here: https://i.imgur.com/BUNjQzh.png, then copy the new page url and send that to the channel./
[15:23:58] <onizu> https://jsfiddle.net/mz4jo8ru/
[15:24:10] <onizu> see it returns 'unchecked' if you check the box and click submit
[15:24:23] <robertmaxrees> does that JS match what you have on your site?
[15:24:26] <onizu> oh wait
[15:24:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:25:06] <onizu> https://jsfiddle.net/mz4jo8ru/1/ -- works
[15:25:39] <onizu> don't know what's wrong at my local end
[15:26:02] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so let's expand on the fiddle then.  how are you sure the if statement is the issue?
[15:26:50] <onizu> coz the console.log in it doesn't show
[15:27:15] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno then.  you're not really giving me many details here :)
[15:29:25] <onizu> the fiddle is what basically i'm trying to do
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> you mentioned a form submit.
[15:30:00] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't have a form.  so keep expanding.
[15:30:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:30:22] <robertmaxrees> are you not preventing the submit or something?
[15:30:32] <robertmaxrees> do you have any JS errors in the console?
[15:30:34] <onizu> no form
[15:30:58] <onizu> yes I'm preventing the submit
[15:31:08] <onizu> coz I just want a JS action really
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> wait you said there's no form but now you're saying you're preventing the submit??
[15:31:14] <onizu> no server side submission
[15:32:00] <robertmaxrees> heck at this point feel free to link the entire page in the channel if you want (pls don't PM it to me).
[15:32:06] <robertmaxrees> or recreate the whole shebang in that fiddle.
[15:32:27] <onizu> $("#btn").click(function (e) {  if($('input#boqNoRateExport').prop('checked')) {  console.log('noRate checked');
[15:32:30] <onizu> like so
[15:32:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not what I asked for :/
[15:32:45] <robertmaxrees> without seeing more information, I really can't help.
[15:32:56] <onizu> e.preventDefault();
[15:33:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, until you can show me a more complete example I can't really help.
[15:33:26] <robertmaxrees> pasting individual lines in chat isn't really going to help :/
[15:33:34] <onizu> ok let me see
[15:43:19] <onizu> how do you pass a variable by reference in js?
[15:44:27] <robertmaxrees> don't have any options.  js passes primitives by value, objects are passed by a weird copy of a reference thing.
[15:46:02] <onizu> is there a way to call this in the script?   right now it is linked to an event: $('input#boqNoRateExport').change(function(boqNoRateExport) {
[15:46:19] <robertmaxrees> erm, that's not how that works :)
[15:46:29] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying to do.
[15:46:34] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle.
[15:48:44] <onizu> something like this - https://jsfiddle.net/mz4jo8ru/2/
[15:48:52] <onizu> i know it's not returning right now
[15:49:21] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah, that doesn't work that way.
[15:49:23] <onizu> maybe that var can be made global
[15:50:04] <robertmaxrees> so with $('input#foo').change(function(boxIsChecked) {, 'boxIsChecked' is the event object still.  you're just giving it a different name.
[15:50:22] <robertmaxrees> (also don't do $('input#foo'), just do $('#foo'))
[15:50:51] <onizu> (also don't do $('input#foo'), just do $('#foo')) - why?
[15:51:23] <robertmaxrees> ids are unique per page.  you couldn't have a span#foo
[15:52:19] <robertmaxrees> either way: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ahwugcks/ - this is what you think you want, though I might rethink the approach here :)
[15:53:04] <onizu> https://jsfiddle.net/mz4jo8ru/3/
[15:53:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:53:26] <robertmaxrees> why are you attaching to the window object?
[15:53:56] <onizu> i thought that's how you target a global scope variable
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> you don't want globally scoped variables.  also: "child" scopes can read from parent scopes: filiated/theology) has joined #jquery
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> [2021:02:08:12:54:24] <robertmaxrees> ids are uniq
[15:54:21] <robertmaxrees> woops
[15:54:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gkL5pqe7/
[15:54:50] <robertmaxrees> but also: why not just do var $foo = $('#foo'); and then check $foo.prop('checked'); as needed?
[15:56:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gkL5pqe7/1/
[15:58:09] <onizu> why do you have "()" at the end? }());
[15:58:24] <robertmaxrees> that's called an IIFE.  without that extra (), it won't work.
[15:58:42] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ for a description.
[15:59:35] <onizu> ok
[16:00:04] <robertmaxrees> you want to avoid using the global scope as much as possible.
[16:01:06] <onizu> ok
