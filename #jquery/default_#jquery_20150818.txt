[00:13:34] <mukesh_> hi guys
[00:13:54] <mukesh_> I need to login to a website based on cookies i have is it possible to get access
[00:14:05] <mukesh_> of website using cookies with ajax call?
[00:16:11] <Cork> mukesh_: just do a normal http(s) login on the page and ajax will pick it up automatically
[00:16:24] <Cork> js doesn't have to do anything
[00:16:36] <mukesh_> let me explain what i need
[00:17:04] <mukesh_> i would like to login some virutal server and over the virutal server i will get cookies
[00:17:24] <mukesh_> and from other machine i want to access website logged in virtual server with the help of cookies
[00:17:31] <mukesh_> is it possible
[00:17:34] <mukesh_> cork?
[00:17:48] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[00:17:52] <Cork> "over virtual server"?
[00:18:01] <Cork> cookies are stored per domain
[00:18:03] <mukesh_> or some other browser
[00:18:30] <Cork> cookies are stored per browser profile and domain
[00:18:43] <Cork> so as long as the profile have a cookie for the domain it would work
[00:18:54] <mukesh_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3342140/cross-domain-cookies
[00:18:57] <mukesh_> something asked here
[00:19:18] <Cork> ah xss
[00:19:29] <mukesh_> any idea how do i achieve this
[00:19:39] <mukesh_> cross site scripting
[00:19:41] <Cork> ya, third party cookies are blocked by default in quite a few browsers
[00:19:52] <Cork> (all of them?)
[00:19:59] <mukesh_> alternative
[00:19:59] <Cork> not much you can do about that
[00:20:17] <mukesh_> so any suggestion
[00:20:18] <Cork> either have the user visit the site to get the cookie
[00:20:23] <Cork> or don't do xss
[00:20:48] <mukesh_> get me out of this somehow Cork
[00:20:49] <Cork> the only other option would be to ask them to enable third party cookie for your domains
[00:21:06] <Cork> mukesh_: there isn't really a way out
[00:21:18] <mukesh_> read the answer someone told
[00:21:19] <mukesh_> cookiemaker.com
[00:21:22] <mukesh_> about that
[00:21:41] <Cork> browser block third party cookies cause it is heavily used to track users
[00:21:58] <mukesh_> I am using chrome extension
[00:22:03] <jak2000> Cork i am happy, deleted a row: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rb8a8bw9/2/
[00:22:06] <mukesh_> that might allow me to third party cookeis
[00:22:16] <Cork> mukesh_: you don't need an extension
[00:22:19] <Cork> just toggle the pref
[00:22:42] <mukesh_> actually i need this feature in chrome extension
[00:22:43] <mukesh_> mate
[00:22:58] <Cork> chrome extensions have _some_ more access
[00:23:13] <mukesh_> I have multiple websites and each website has login, i will login to my app and bypass login
[00:23:19] <jak2000> other version: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rb8a8bw9/3/
[00:23:20] <Cork> it might be able to inject a domain exception
[00:23:20] <mukesh_> for other websites using chrome extension
[00:23:23] <Cork> not sure never tried
[00:23:37] <Cork> you would have to ask someone that knows the chrome api
[00:23:40] <mukesh_> yeah i can inject anything
[00:23:44] <mukesh_> using chrome extension
[00:23:56] <mukesh_> not a issue but i want to confirm if xss works
[00:23:57] <Cork> mukesh_: off topic for this channel
[00:24:07] <mukesh_> hmm
[00:24:14] <Cork> mukesh_: that depends on the browser and settings
[00:24:16] <mukesh_> okay thanks Cork
[00:24:18] <Cork> not jquery
[00:25:33] <Cork> jak2000: http://jsfiddle.net/rb8a8bw9/4/
[00:25:43] <Cork> else it will break if you add more rows
[00:33:35] <jak2000> ok why break?
[00:34:27] <Cork> jak2000: you're adding event listener to the buttons directly
[00:34:40] <Cork> so if you add a new row you will add a new button without an event listener
[00:34:48] <Cork> so the button won't work
[00:35:03] <jak2000> ok
[00:36:47] <jak2000> i need understand why jquery sometimes, not know the input text names/values, normally i  i declared allmy js code on a separate file named, myjquery.js  i declare this file in <head> html section, under <title>
[00:36:51] <jak2000> any advices?
[00:41:06] <Cork> jak2000: you need to wait for jquery.ready to fire
[00:41:15] <Cork> before that the dom won't exist so js can't find them
[00:41:28] <Cork> ?api ready
[00:41:30] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[00:42:58] <jak2000> yes my js file start with:
[00:43:05] <jak2000> $(document).ready(function () {
[00:43:07] <jak2000> its ok?
[00:43:15] <Cork> then it should work just fine inside it
[00:43:34] <Cork> site note $(function() {}) is the same thing as $(document).ready(function() {})
[00:43:42] <Cork> if you want to reduce the boiler plate :)
[00:43:50] <Utils> If I wanted to build FormData myself, how would I add a file field to that?
[00:44:08] <Cork> Utils: you wouldn't
[00:44:14] <Cork> ah sorry
[00:44:29] <Cork> mistook what you meant by formdata :)
[00:44:38] <Cork> Utils: just .append the file object
[00:45:12] <Cork> Utils: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications
[00:45:25] <Cork> jquery example included :)
[00:50:57] <dude999> hello
[00:55:30] <Utils> Hmm that has some useful stuff that I could use. I was doing the onchange method. I wonder if the problem is on the server end then because photo ends up being an empty object for some reason
[00:55:47] <Utils> checked the headers sent and it all seems there.
[00:56:45] <jak2000> hi.. other thing: http://pastebin.com/n5v8jwNq i add rows to my table with jquery see line: 325  (work OK, if you see the button i am interested is on line: 324), add the row, but when the user click on the button, not display the alert: see the lines: 384-386 any advice how to fix it? thanks
[01:00:32] <Utils> Oh it is there... just Laravel has a bunch of functions instead of a direct object of the file ;D
[01:31:28] <Utils> How would I handle if an ajax request returned a 404 or 500 etc and the dataType is set as json ?
[01:42:26] <john-dev> Utils: http://pastebin.com/3gbUYYnE
[01:44:08] <Utils> ooo ok thanks
[01:50:30] <Utils> john-dev: is that only possible with $.ajax and not with $.post ?
[01:53:35] <jac0bz1> I have this function that clones some html and appends it to a div, within that i have two inputs, but when trying to set .focus() on the first, with spesefic class name, it focuses on the second one??
[01:55:38] <norc> Utils: Please dont use these callbacks. Use promises.
[01:55:59] <jac0bz1> http://pastebin.com/kf1nzmi5 here is my code
[01:56:08] <jac0bz1> (well, part's of it anyways )
[01:56:44] <Utils> norc: .done, .fail and .always?
[01:56:49] <norc> Utils: Yeah.
[01:57:23] <norc> Utils: Your fail callback gets jqXHR, textStatus and errorThrown. Throw in a switch statement in there if you need to handle some status codes specially.
[01:57:37] <norc> Utils: callbacks in ajax are so 2006.
[01:58:28] <Utils> norc: which one contains the status? is that textStatus?
[01:58:42] <norc> Utils: jqXHR.status
[02:00:55] <norc> Utils: http://jsfiddle.net/cajvnda3/
[02:03:30] <Utils> norc: http://pastie.org/private/uqmh0ef7cdx9km0fpxdudw something like this?
[02:03:37] <Utils> any other changes you'd like to make? :P
[02:05:27] <norc> Utils: Document that fallthrough in your switch. Otherwise if you are happy with it
[02:06:02] <Utils> alrighty.
[02:06:03] <Utils> thanks.
[02:06:39] <norc> Utils: Also use === instead of == unless you really want implicit type conversions.
[02:08:12] <Utils> I use === when it's necessary. .length would always return an integer, so == works just fine. is there any other benefits to using === over ==?
[02:09:12] <norc> Utils: Do it the other way around. You dont want implicit type conversions happening - they lead to bugs.
[02:09:51] <Utils> Will bare that in mind.
[02:10:19] <norc> Utils: https://jslinterrors.com/option-jshint-eqeqeq  -
[02:11:44] <Utils> I don't need to install anything for that do I, it's just a comment and the browser's javascript engine handles that?
[02:13:53] <norc> Utils: I run it in TextMate to validate code correctness and quality. JSLint/JSHint enforce code quality, guidelines and safe patterns.
[02:14:53] <Utils> there is probably a sublime plugin for it then ;D
[02:15:38] <Utils> Another question, I have various snippets of javascript per page, they're one time use things but cluttering up the markup with javascript isn't really appealing. Should I put all javascript for all pages in one big file whether I need them or not?
[02:15:46] <Utils> or create a gazillion individual files?
[02:16:52] <norc> Utils: Create a gazillion individual files. There are mechanisms that can create a minified cached version to serve your clients.
[02:17:34] <norc> Utils: Are you using some common web framework?
[02:18:08] <Utils> norc: Front end is hand written apart from jquery and some other libs.
[02:18:20] <Utils> The backend uses Laravel
[02:19:14] <norc> Utils: That is the price then. Usually web frameworks (along with a lot of other things) provide for some kind of asset pipeline that simplifies serving stylesheets, javascript and static assets (such as images or static content).
[02:19:41] <norc> Utils: Ah Id look into Laravel what possibilities it has for asset management
[02:41:26] <op> I want to rewrite this file in order to not use jQuery: http://pastebin.com/XNAQbYFV . Is it better to rewrite in JS or AngularJS?
[02:48:34] <hrusti> how can I delete all cookies except session?
[02:51:13] <Tennis> eat the cookies in 1 session
[02:53:52] <hrusti> :)
[03:17:25] <Mark_2> does anyone know why the jquery ajax load won’t work when click on the white box on the top left of this website? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/lessons
[03:23:31] <john-dev> Mark_2: nopaste your jquery code pls
[03:24:13] <Mark_2> in the pastebin?
[03:25:20] <Mark_2> here it is  http://pastebin.com/Jh6dsiEK
[03:25:27] <Mark_2> it’s real simple.
[03:25:30] <Mark_2> but i have another question.
[03:29:54] <john-dev> Mark_2: where is that code located?
[03:30:29] <Mark_2> second.
[03:32:05] <Mark_2> solved. thanks
[03:43:18] <DarsVaeda> I use .wrap but on debian in firefox this adds the element that wraps on top of the html even above doctype in firebug, have you seen this? I don't get this on windows...so I wonder, is it a firebugbug or jquery
[03:43:57] <DarsVaeda> there is no problem at all, everything works fine there is just this element floating around
[03:45:49] <Cork> DarsVaeda: the os doesn't matter
[03:46:09] <Cork> it most likely is about what you have in the variables you run .wrap with
[03:50:22] <DarsVaeda> hmm I'm just unsure it is just a display bug in firebug itself cause the element is wrapped properly it
[03:50:40] <DarsVaeda> but if the element is added again too, that would be a problem
[03:54:40] <illio> I have a problem with a hidden iframe in Firefox. Specifically on this site http://illio.dk/QualificationTest.php each tab loads an iframe of an existing system. The first tab loads the system correctly, but the others don't. It seems this happens because of Firefox' behaviour when an iframe is set to display: none (which Jquery Tabs do by default). I'm wondering if anyone knows of any fix to this issue? The only thing I have worki
[03:54:41] <illio> ng so far is refreshing the iframes when each tab is activated, but that's not ideal.
[03:58:23] <Cork> illio: change display: none to display: block; visibility: hidden;
[03:58:50] <DarsVaeda> ah I can replicate it in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/L0Lzvs16/
[04:01:08] <DarsVaeda> and the reason is the .unwrap
[04:01:20] <DarsVaeda> if I comment it, the problem does not occur
[04:02:21] <DarsVaeda> do I need to delete the unwrapped elements manually?
[04:02:28] <illio> Cork, How do I do that so it sticks though? Tabs seems to be overruling my changes?
[04:02:50] <Cork> DarsVaeda: uh... are you sure the code does what you expect?
[04:02:58] <Cork> you do .empty so the code won't be in the dom
[04:03:03] <Cork> so .unwrap won't work
[04:03:35] <Cork> illio: haven't used tabs in ages but i think it sets classes for the visibility states
[04:03:50] <Cork> like ui-state-visible or something like that (don't remember)
[04:04:03] <Cork> just set those classes to use visibitilty instead of display
[04:04:32] <DarsVaeda> Cork, not my code but it does work as expected
[04:05:16] <DarsVaeda> I guess the element should be cleared and then the <a> should be removed
[04:06:00] <Cork> DarsVaeda: what the code does: 1) find the section element, 2) set the parentNode = null. 3) check if the parent is <a> (won't ever happen) 4) create an <a> element and give the null as it's parent and make element the children
[04:06:09] <Cork> so... no, i don't think it does what you want
[04:06:28] <DarsVaeda> huh?
[04:06:31] <Cork> ugg.. sorry i thought wrong >_<
[04:06:37] <Cork> empty not detatch...
[04:06:38] <illio> Cork, okay, I'll try that. Thanks.
[04:06:40] <DarsVaeda> np
[04:06:41] <Cork> *sick*
[04:06:47] <Cork> * *sigh*
[04:07:01] <Cork> ok, new try :)
[04:07:12] <DarsVaeda> :P
[04:07:12] <Cork> DarsVaeda: so what exactly are you getting that is wrong?
[04:07:43] <DarsVaeda> the problem is that the unwrapped elements (those <a>'s) appear on top of my html code in firebug
[04:07:58] <DarsVaeda> so I wonder are they really placed there or is it a firebug bug
[04:08:02] <Cork> DarsVaeda: btw '<a href="foo.html?x="' + count + '></a>' should be '<a href="foo.html?x=' + count + '"></a>'
[04:08:23] <Cork> or you will get <a 1="" href="foo.html?x=">
[04:08:31] <DarsVaeda> I'm not sick but well just a typo :)
[04:08:50] <Cork> heh sick was a typo, i meant *sigh*
[04:09:16] <DarsVaeda> hehe
[04:09:18] <DarsVaeda> okay
[04:09:26] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and what do you mean by "ontop"?
[04:09:31] <Cork> before it in the dom tree?
[04:10:30] <Cork> cause i can't reproduce it at all
[04:11:59] <DarsVaeda> http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150818/8uxxyopl.png
[04:12:28] <Cork> that looks like you're leaking dom elements
[04:12:52] <Cork> i would also make sure firebug is up to date
[04:12:52] <DarsVaeda> what does that mean?
[04:13:05] <pbiendl> Hey Guys, is there a way in jQuery to get the current index of an element? Example: I have 10 <span> on my page, 5 of them have the class "clickable". Now if i click on the 3rd of this <span>s (with the class), how can i get the index of it (in this case "2")?
[04:13:51] <Cork> DarsVaeda: some older versions of firebug leaks things
[04:14:02] <Cork> so make sure you have firebug 2.x
[04:14:03] <DarsVaeda> ah it is the current
[04:14:23] <Cork> well can't reproduce it here
[04:14:36] <pbiendl> I know theres a .each(function(index) {}) method, but i cant use that here, because at the time .each runs, i dont know about the class
[04:14:42] <Cork> but it looks like a firebug bug
[04:14:57] <DarsVaeda> okay then I'll report it, thanks
[04:15:10] <taplar> pbiendl: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[04:15:10] <Cork> well you would have to find what causes it
[04:15:18] <Cork> cause like i said, can't reproduce it
[04:15:31] <Cork> so it is most likely an extension or something like that breaking things
[04:16:10] <pbiendl> taplar: Ah thx, didnt know theres a index method, wil try it thanks! :)
[04:16:41] <norc> pbiendl: Is there a reason why you need the index=
[04:17:33] <pbiendl> norc: It's complicated... It's about a Lightbox Script which starts different image groups on the page. The groups are stored in data-attributes of a-tags
[04:17:53] <pbiendl> But i think it should work with .index - im testing it right now
[04:18:40] <Uhkis> DarsVaeda: does that happen if you add text to that <a> ?
[04:23:50] <pbiendl> Ok, .index() worked :)
[04:24:31] <taplar> cool
[04:36:00] <henny1219191> Hi All I'm looking for some pointers on where to start with a project. The aim is to have a meeting agenda as a list displayed to the side of a embedded youtube video and have the list follow the video and also have the list be clickable to jump the video to the corresponding point in time. i have the clicking bit working and interfacing with the youtube Iframe Api and have managed to expose the current playback time in seconds 
[04:36:03] <henny1219191> what i need help with is animating the list against the time. Eventually the list will be populated using an ajax call from MySql/Php so jquery could build the list to begin . any pointers towards similar examples that could be reworked or used for inspiration would be good cheers ian
[04:36:07] <henny1219191> what i need help with is animating the list against the time. Eventually the list will be populated using an ajax call from MySql/Php so jquery could build the list to begin . any pointers towards similar examples that could be reworked or used for inspiration would be good cheers ian
[04:36:51] <norc> henny1219191: Start with functionality. Do you have a working jsfiddle?
[04:38:31] <henny1219191> i dont have anything in way of a list , was looking for some insperation on where to start , i have used some JSfiddle examples to get control of the youtube and to expose the time.
[04:50:02] <taplar> henny1219191: from what i'm seeing from a short google escapade, there are no events that the youtube player throws as time progresses.  so you'd need to periodically check the play time to update your list
[04:51:33] <henny1219191> taplar: im uesing http://jsfiddle.net/StephanieQ/2sj9smnd/ as the the methord of extracting the time but
[04:52:52] <taplar> yeah, so you got your interval checking of the play time there
[04:52:52] <henny1219191> what im trying to work out is how best to "tag" the items in the list with their time then check this against the current time
[04:53:05] <taplar> oh
[04:53:09] <taplar> you could put data elements on them
[04:53:19] <taplar> data-startTime="" data-endTime=""
[04:53:51] <taplar> or if the list is created dynamically those could just be props instead
[04:55:01] <henny1219191> i just need start time so if start time passed the background colour changes or whatever , the list would come from a php/mysql backend so the list could be done dynamically
[04:55:17] <taplar> ah
[04:55:47] <taplar> so yeah, $(someLiElementOrWhateverElement).prop('startTime', value)
[04:56:50] <taplar> then in your evaluation of time check if it is past that and if so, add some class to the element that changes the bg color
[04:57:26] <taplar> and removes the class if not, incase the users jump back in the play
[04:59:35] <henny1219191> thanks ,
[05:01:10] <henny1219191> im off to play with .prop
[05:01:19] <taplar> gl
[05:02:52] <Mark_2> does anyone know how ajax load can take css style on the contents loaded?
[05:03:11] <DarsVaeda> Cork, yep when I place a text in that link it happens too
[05:03:17] <Cork> Mark_2: it is just html
[05:03:28] <Cork> so if the css is in there it will be injected into the current page
[05:03:41] <Mark_2> im not sure if im following what you are saying.
[05:03:41] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it wasn't me asking that
[05:03:51] <Mark_2> im experimenting with this website of mine
[05:03:59] <Mark_2> but it only loads contents not the css styling.
[05:04:07] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[05:04:17] <Cork> Mark_2: ya, cause you're either loading a fragment or use a selector for parts of the page
[05:04:19] <Mark_2> if you click on the white box on the top left
[05:04:27] <Mark_2> hmm,...
[05:04:27] <Cork> so you don't get the css defined in the external css file
[05:04:36] <Mark_2> how do i solve then?
[05:04:42] <Cork> but note the css you load through .load will affect you're entire page
[05:04:48] <Mark_2> right.
[05:04:50] <Cork> the best solution is to share the css
[05:04:59] <Cork> so the current page already have all the styling you need
[05:05:04] <Mark_2> hmm
[05:05:10] <Mark_2> ill try that, thanks
[05:05:19] <Cork> else you have a gigantic risk of having styling conflicts
[05:05:46] <Cork> where the current page breaks when it loads a page that happen to have a selector that is more specific then one you have and override it
[05:06:06] <Mark_2> one more question though, do you know by any chance how this wordpress theme managed to load menus without refreshing the page?
[05:06:07] <Mark_2> http://demo.qodeinteractive.com/bridge/about-us/
[05:06:33] <Mark_2> is it ajax load loading the entire page on one single page?
[05:07:58] <Whirled> Mark_2, what do you mean?
[05:08:07] <Mark_2> Whirled:  hmm?
[05:08:08] <Cork> ya, i don't get it either
[05:08:15] <Mark_2> excuse my english.
[05:08:18] <Cork> all i can see is just normal pages
[05:08:19] <Mark_2> i have terribly short knowledge of
[05:08:25] <Cork> no special loading there
[05:08:38] <Mark_2> if you clilck on the pages, it loads without refreshing the page
[05:08:47] <Mark_2> i was only curious if that was done with ajax
[05:08:50] <Cork> what page?
[05:08:54] <Whirled> np, I don't see where it loads anything it's a one page site?
[05:08:54] <Mark_2> sec
[05:09:12] <Cork> ah now i see
[05:09:20] <Mark_2> yep
[05:09:43] <Cork> Mark_2: it loads them through ajax and then use history.pushState to change the url
[05:09:58] <Cork> and then ya, just injects the html into the current page
[05:09:59] <Whirled> that sounds like jquery bbq
[05:10:15] <Mark_2> what’s jquery bbq?
[05:10:15] <Cork> bbq is just one way to do it
[05:10:20] <Mark_2> hmm
[05:10:22] <Cork> ?g jquery bbq
[05:10:22] <Mark_2> oh well,
[05:10:22] <b-ot> Cork: Ben Alman » jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library → http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[05:10:53] <Cork> rails has turbolinks for the same thing
[05:10:56] <Whirled> the push state allows you to go back but it captures the onhashchange event to prevent loading a new page
[05:10:58] <Cork> for example
[05:11:11] <Cork> well pushState is more to change the url
[05:11:18] <Cork> sure it means you can do back button things too
[05:12:14] <Varun_Krishna> I guys I am trying to validate an input field in javascript that should contain any number in the combination between 1 and 9 but my code is not working http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/syyjyLwu/3/
[05:12:23] <Whirled> That, as it turns out, is more important than the url for most wordpress installs. The url is never valid in wordpress *
[05:12:29] <Mark_2> i’ll do it one step at a time
[05:12:49] <Mark_2> if i have to push the address i’ll let you guys know.
[05:12:50] <taplar> Varun_Krishna: how many characters are allowed?
[05:12:51] <Mark_2> lolz
[05:13:07] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: many more than 1
[05:13:25] <taplar> have a max or no?
[05:14:02] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: No.
[05:14:14] <Whirled> Mark_2, if you want to enable the back button on your browser, you need to push the state, otherwise it will be frustrating for users who are used to navigating with the back button
[05:14:16] <taplar> k, use the greedy selector '+'
[05:14:36] <Mark_2> Whirled: right.
[05:14:42] <Kartagis> I am trying to create a phonegap app and am in the process of writing the ajax request. however, what I am having difficulty with is when the field has multiple values ie. when you add another row to table with ajax. my ajax request's relevant bit looks like http://paste.ubuntu.com/12117744/ and my structure like http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/qq562nko/
[05:14:49] <Mark_2> but right now im having a hard time catching up with the site i gave you
[05:14:55] <Mark_2> so, that won’t be happening anytime soon
[05:14:59] <Kartagis> how should I get multiple values?
[05:15:07] <DarsVaeda> Cork, oh sorry
[05:15:07] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: /[1-9]+/ ???
[05:15:14] <m1su> Varun_Krishna: you are missing a } after line 8
[05:15:19] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: But why none of my alerts showing up?
[05:15:22] <DarsVaeda> Uhkis, yep when I place a text in that link it happens too
[05:16:01] <taplar> yeah, missing } is doing a parse error so nothing is running
[05:16:08] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: you want /^[1-9]+$/ not just /[1-9]+/
[05:16:10] <Varun_Krishna> m1su: Yes you are correct. I just missed it out
[05:16:19] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Okay
[05:16:31] <Cork> else you will only check that there is at least one number in there
[05:17:14] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/syyjyLwu/4/
[05:17:34] <taplar> missing your ^
[05:17:38] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: What those funny little characters '+' and '$" doing there ?
[05:17:40] <taplar> at the start
[05:17:47] <taplar> ^ is start of line
[05:17:50] <taplar> $ is end of line
[05:17:56] <taplar> + is greedy selector
[05:18:01] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: i just realized i jumped to conclution a bit
[05:18:15] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: you want it to only allow 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ?
[05:18:23] <Cork> or is 11 and 19 ok too?
[05:18:41] <Varun_Krishna> Yes a combination of number between 1 and 9 exactly.
[05:18:54] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/syyjyLwu/5/
[05:18:54] <Varun_Krishna> yeah 11 2323 9897 whatever
[05:19:00] <Whirled> I just want to take a minute to thank #jquery. It is so much better than #wordpress in terms of people being nice and gratious and helpful. I miss it here.
[05:19:33] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: also you want oneToNineRE.test not match
[05:20:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/syyjyLwu/7/
[05:20:54] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: anyway /[1-9]/ means "check if there is a character in the string between 1-9"
[05:21:05] <Cork> it doesn't care if there is anything beside that single character
[05:21:12] <Varun_Krishna> Cork:  Thank you man :)
[05:21:19] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: so to make the validation you have to make sure it is only those allowed characters
[05:21:29] <Cork> that is where ^ and $ comes in
[05:21:36] <Cork> and + is to allow repetition
[05:21:59] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: I thought '^' it as anything but this string.
[05:22:12] <Cork> no, regex doesn't really have that
[05:22:20] <Cork> you have invert match with !
[05:22:24] <taplar> i believe it does, but it has to be inside []
[05:22:31] <Varun_Krishna> He he he :)
[05:22:32] <Cork> and.. ya that :)
[05:23:04] <Cork> but note regex engines check for characters not specifically strings
[05:23:09] <Varun_Krishna> Cork:  Which is better .test or .match() ?
[05:23:16] <Cork> .test
[05:23:16] <b-ot> Cork: torst
[05:23:22] <Cork> <_<
[05:23:27] * Cork kicks b-ot
[05:23:40] <taplar> hey, he's not bad.  he's just programmed that way
[05:23:48] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: .test returns true/false to check if the regex matches
[05:24:00] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: .match returns an object with the matched groups
[05:24:29] <Mark_2> okay, now i succeed with loading contents using ajax, but how do i do the address pushing thing?
[05:24:33] <Cork> so you're testing that match returns null not really if the regex matches
[05:24:56] <Cork> `mdn history manupilation
[05:24:56] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide - Mozilla ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[05:25:03] <Cork> Mark_2: ^
[05:25:19] <Mark_2> and im only curious if there’s anyway i can have preloader with ajax load?
[05:25:38] <Cork> Mark_2: no you can't you would use $.get for that
[05:25:58] <Cork> cause .load is meant to fetch it from the server and push it into the page
[05:26:06] <Mark_2> but this one has nice loading effects http://demo.qodeinteractive.com/bridge/tabs/
[05:26:20] <Cork> ya, you would have to do that you're self
[05:26:30] <Cork> basically have two "container" elements
[05:26:38] <Cork> load the new content in a different container
[05:26:41] <Cork> animate over to it
[05:26:45] <Cork> and then clear the old one
[05:26:52] <Cork> (for later use)
[05:33:08] <Whirled> the biggest problem with loading pages in jquery from a wordpress site is how wordpress decodes the url to determine it's content
[05:34:17] <Mark_2> thanks for letting me know
[05:35:01] <Whirled> You are fine so long as you stick with simple content. But wp loves to add all kinds of craziness to the url so it can parse the quiery variables to determine which content to grab from the database.
[05:35:39] <Whirled> none of those wordpress pages you see in a url actually exist. It's all index.php loading data from the database and making it look like a url
[05:35:57] <Cork> basically all cms systems work like that
[05:36:11] <Cork> of not exactly all :)
[05:36:38] <Whirled> I didn't know that, good to know, thanks
[05:38:11] <Kartagis> I am trying to create a phonegap app and am in the process of writing the ajax request. however, what I am having difficulty with is when the field has multiple values ie. when you add another row to table with ajax. my ajax request's relevant bit looks like http://paste.ubuntu.com/12117744/ and my structure like http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/qq562nko/
[05:39:00] <Kartagis> how should I modify my code in the case of multiple values?
[05:39:10] <Kartagis> brb, have to reboot
[05:40:18] <adv_> what do you people think about isotope library?
[05:40:35] <taplar> sounds radioactive
[05:41:41] <taplar> looks cool
[05:44:14] <Kartagis> back
[05:45:41] <prohobo> adv_: i dont like isotope
[05:45:44] <prohobo> i like masonry though
[05:45:55] <adv_> prohobo: why?
[05:46:01] <prohobo> first, masonry is free
[05:46:06] <prohobo> second, less buggy
[05:46:18] <prohobo> third, i dont need any of the isotope layouts
[05:46:18] <adv_> prohobo: i want a search field and masonry doesn't offer that from what i've seen
[05:46:29] <prohobo> you can code your own in like 10 minutes
[05:47:00] <adv_> seems like a popular thing to do and didn't find any fiddles :/
[05:47:53] <henny1219191> hi all, im playing with the Jquery Accordion example that can be found at https://jqueryui.com/accordion/ , what i want to do is when the head of each part of the Accordion is opened i want to call another function with diffrent value for each hedder e.g seek(2558) or seek(2324) can this be done if so how?
[05:48:02] <prohobo> $('.box').filter(function() { if ($(this).text().indexOf($('#search').text()) != -1) return false; return true;}).hide();
[05:48:04] <prohobo> bam
[05:48:45] <prohobo> you just searched
[05:49:23] <ifohancroft> Hey guys/girls/everything in between (in case someone doesn't defines itself as either) how can I select an option with value that ends with something? For example I have options with values wtf, ftw, brb and ggtf. I want to select every option whos value ends in tf
[05:49:31] <prohobo> no
[05:49:46] <prohobo> dont bring your gender politics here
[05:49:58] <taplar> ifohancroft: you'll have to do a custom finder or filter
[05:50:08] <taplar> giving it the function that does the match on the value
[05:50:35] <adv_> prohobo: hm thanks! i have to try
[05:50:43] <taplar> for an example look up there at prohobo 's filter
[05:50:58] <adv_> btw can masonry do equally sized grid?
[05:51:03] <prohobo> taplar
[05:51:17] <prohobo> he can just use $('.foo[value$="tf"])
[05:51:19] <ifohancroft> So there's no thing like option[value$="' + filter +'"] for example?
[05:51:28] <prohobo> he/she/it
[05:51:32] <ifohancroft> he :D
[05:51:33] <prohobo> can use that, i mean
[05:51:39] <taplar> huh, didn't know value was available
[05:51:40] <prohobo> $= is ends with
[05:51:58] <prohobo> actually yeah im not sure it is, but i think it might be
[05:52:15] <ifohancroft> I have tried it but it didn't work but I think I have just realised where my mistake is
[05:53:13] <prohobo> then you'll just have to use a filter
[05:56:38] <ifohancroft> How to go about it if the thing you want to match is the inner html (between <option> and </option>, not the value)?
[05:56:50] <taplar> text()
[05:57:14] <taplar> or html(), but you most likely want text()
[05:57:26] <ifohancroft> I know I can select it that way but the match is in the form of [attribute$=something]
[05:57:44] <ifohancroft> can I match an element using [text$=something]?
[05:57:48] <taplar> html, definitely, you have to do a custom filter/findor
[05:58:00] <taplar> no, it's not an attribute on the element
[05:58:44] <taplar> where as for <option value=""> value is
[05:59:51] <ifohancroft> Btw this is the reason why at first, I couldn't select what I want with [value$="something"] because the value was different from the .text() and what I was trying to filter was actually the html
[06:00:36] <taplar> well, if you have control of the html and can modify it, you could always put the text on the element too, like data-text="blah" and then you could use that to find on
[06:01:23] <taplar> dunno if either is more efficient than the other
[06:04:42] <ifohancroft> Yes, I do have control over it.
[06:04:56] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/au4zf0gf/1/
[06:05:39] <ifohancroft> Thank you. I already have that. I will just re-generate the html to contain the text in data-text=""
[06:16:11] <taplar> btw, completely off topic for the room.  but the game Victor Vran on GoG, very good game
[06:22:43] <Duvdevan> Srbende
[07:22:37] <prohobo> fou fou
[07:27:44] <taplar> little bunny?
[07:35:10] <KnightsOfNi> I have these properties on a div: width:268px;
[07:35:13] <KnightsOfNi>     border:1px solid green; box-sizing:border-box; - when doing .width() on that div, it returns 266. why?
[07:37:16] <ryan2049> maybe the parent is constraining it?
[07:37:25] <doctrv> that's what border-box does
[07:37:37] <doctrv> the 2px of border takes away from the width
[07:37:56] <KnightsOfNi> default it would be a total of 270px
[07:38:08] <KnightsOfNi> with border-box, the borders don't add up to the width of the div
[07:38:20] <KnightsOfNi> so it should be 268px when requesting the width, no?
[07:38:37] <doctrv> nope, see http://api.jquery.com/width/
[07:38:52] <doctrv> ".width() will always return the content width"
[07:39:08] <KnightsOfNi> oh i see
[07:39:11] <doctrv> which in your case is 268 - 2 = 266px
[07:39:51] <hellyeah> yo
[07:39:57] <hellyeah> sorry for simple question
[07:40:03] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/603j48a5/1/,
[07:40:07] <KnightsOfNi> jquery does not care about the box model setting then?
[07:40:09] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/603j48a5/1/
[07:40:27] <hellyeah> ops
[07:40:54] <KnightsOfNi> hellyeah, you gave it an ID
[07:41:13] <hellyeah> found my mistake
[07:41:13] <KnightsOfNi> and in your jquery you do .p1 - which refers to elements with class p1, not id
[07:41:19] <hellyeah> i did same mistake everytime
[07:41:29] <hellyeah> and i realized later
[08:00:27] <logikos> using var getobj = {foo:"bar",a:1}; $.get('url',getobj); will append ?foo=bar&a=1 to the url .. how would i do ?foo=bar&a=1&blah&whatever
[08:00:40] <logikos> some properties with no value
[08:00:46] <logikos> i tried doing blah:null
[08:00:57] <logikos> but that results in &blah=&somethingelse
[08:13:10] <pyCasso> is there a very small js snippet that will take an html table and convert into a JSON object?
[08:13:47] <Cork> pyCasso: not a generic table no
[08:14:03] <Cork> also what structure do you want to get the table as?
[08:14:18] <pyCasso> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/5q1032qd/
[08:15:11] <pyCasso> each table row is an object with each column as key value pairs
[08:17:12] <Cork> pyCasso: well you would first have to have a translation array that converts the columns offset to a key
[08:18:02] <Cork> after that you would just have to do $('table tbody tr').each(function() { $(this).find('td').each(function() {}) })
[08:18:53] <pyCasso> i found a small library https://github.com/lightswitch05/table-to-json
[08:22:40] <pyCasso> Cork: im stuck https://jsfiddle.net/5q1032qd/1/
[08:23:42] <pyCasso> I only need "topic, posted by, and date" columns
[08:29:46] <Cork> pyCasso: https://jsfiddle.net/5q1032qd/2/
[08:29:51] <Cork> note don't use alert for debugging
[08:33:06] <pyCasso> what did you do different Cork?
[08:33:42] <Cork> 1. replaced alert with console.log, 2. moved rows to an argument instead of a global, 3. added JSON.stringify at the end of the jsonObject function
[08:33:46] <pyCasso> and the json object is invalid
[08:33:56] <Cork> it is valid json
[08:34:14] <Cork> remove  JSON.stringify if you want an array instead
[08:34:29] <pyCasso> when i copy the console log into json validator i get errors
[08:34:39] <pyCasso> will do
[08:35:06] <pyCasso> if i wanted to grab the posted by td how would i do that??
[08:35:46] <Cork> pyCasso: btw that function doesn't do what you want
[08:36:39] <Cork> it just grabs the html of the first three columns and add them as rows
[08:37:44] <pyCasso> i need each row to have the first 3 columns. what should i modify? thats the tricky part
[08:40:12] <pyCasso> somehow i want to say rowdata[key].push( { "title": $(v[0].html() ,"postedby" : $(v[1]).html() ...etc} ).
[08:41:34] <pyCasso> like maybe store the tds as an array and use array.push("title":array[0]) ...etc
[08:44:06] <pyCasso> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/5q1032qd/3/
[08:46:02] <Cork> pyCasso: https://jsfiddle.net/5q1032qd/4/
[08:46:24] <Cork> pyCasso: and also never ever user [class*=""]
[08:46:48] <Cork> opps...
[08:46:50] <Cork> hmm
[08:47:36] <Cork> pyCasso: there fixed the bug with the "undefined" key
[08:47:37] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/5q1032qd/5/
[08:48:02] <pyCasso> why not use [class*=""] selector?
[08:48:11] <robertmaxrees> that’s slow.
[08:48:15] <Cork> cause that uses the class attribute as a string
[08:48:26] <Cork> it isn't using class as a class selector
[08:48:34] <Cork> and that is a really bad idea
[08:48:50] <Cork> and... it make my heart cry every time i see it...
[08:49:19] <Cork> hmm really bad is over stating... but it is a bad idea
[08:49:21] <pyCasso> awe poor thing..it's all over my code lol
[08:49:38] <Cork> you should read up on selector performance in that case
[08:49:40] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso using attribute selectors is usually a bad idea.
[08:49:45] <Cork> ya
[08:49:53] <Cork> the only thing that is worse is :contains
[08:49:56] <robertmaxrees> the whole point of classes is that you have a bunch of elements with the same selector.
[08:50:22] <pyCasso> how else would i select elements using similar class names?
[08:50:35] <robertmaxrees> you don’t use “similar”
[08:50:46] <robertmaxrees> you want “the same” - unique classes defeats the point.
[08:51:06] <Cork> pyCasso: the problem you have is that you have compound class names
[08:51:11] <Cork> you should never ever do that
[08:51:19] <lindii_> any idea why i have this margin difference in chrome and firefox http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EjzeoO
[08:51:24] <pyCasso> will the application i work with tends to render dynamic class names
[08:51:32] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso that doesn’t make sense.
[08:51:38] <pyCasso> *well
[08:51:41] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso class names shouldn’t ever be “dynamic”.
[08:51:42] <Cork> pyCasso: <tr class="tb-green"> should have been <tr class="tb green">
[08:51:47] <robertmaxrees> that completely defeats the purpose.
[08:51:58] <Cork> then you could have selected it as .tb or .tb.green
[08:52:14] <pyCasso> i agree
[08:52:23] <pyCasso> this was just a example
[08:52:34] <Cork> a class name should never have more then one single meaning
[08:52:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:52:45] <Cork> and it should avoid overloading a meaning another class has
[08:53:02] <Cork> just have more class names to the element if you need compound meanings
[08:53:09] <pyCasso> but the software i use will take a class of apples and dymacally append "123-apples"
[08:53:20] <robertmaxrees> wut
[08:53:27] <robertmaxrees> what “software” is this?
[08:53:28] <Cork> then add your own class that doesn't depend on those classes
[08:53:52] <Cork> i for example know drupal used to do this back pre 7
[08:53:53] <pyCasso> I can't...and robertmaxrees..its complicated i know
[08:53:56] <Cork> (haven't used it since)
[08:54:05] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso it’s not complicated - it’s bad.
[08:54:10] <Cork> ya
[08:54:13] <pyCasso> yep
[08:54:16] <pyCasso> indeed
[08:54:21] <anotheryou> hi. Can I use jquery-selectors in an if-statement? somehow it does not validate as true... (I can make a fiddle if necessary)
[08:54:29] <pyCasso> so I hack solutions all day
[08:54:36] <robertmaxrees> anotheryou you mean like if ($(‘someSelector’)) {} ?
[08:54:47] <Cork> anotheryou: if($('selector').length > 0) {} else {}
[08:54:52] <robertmaxrees> or just $(‘someSelector’).length
[08:54:56] <robertmaxrees> no need to compare - 0 is falsy :)
[08:55:19] <Cork> ya, but i don't like converting numbers to booleans
[08:55:42] <anotheryou> Cork, robertmaxrees myStuff = $('thing'); if(myStuff == $('thing')){/*true*/}
[08:55:48] <Cork> no
[08:55:55] <Cork> you can't compare two jquery instances
[08:55:59] <robertmaxrees> anotheryou you need to do myStuff.length, not myStuff == $()
[08:56:02] <Cork> they will always be different
[08:56:17] <anotheryou> Cork, I guessed so. thanks for clarifying :)
[08:56:42] <robertmaxrees> also: $(‘anything’) will always be truthy.  need to check the .length property.
[08:56:49] <Cork> ya
[08:56:55] <anotheryou> :) great
[08:56:58] <Cork> as $() will always return an object
[08:57:04] <Cork> so not falsy
[08:57:25] <jak2000> hi Cork
[08:57:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.  just about any object is truthy, except for ‘’, 0, false, etc.
[08:57:29] <Cork> o/
[08:57:47] <Cork> those aren't exactly objects though :)
[08:57:52] <robertmaxrees> sure they are :)
[08:57:57] <Cork> they are "natives" simulating objects
[08:58:06] <Cork> :)
[08:58:08] <robertmaxrees> everything is an object, those just happen to evaluate to false.
[08:59:05] <Cork> the best one is (NaN == NaN) === false :D
[08:59:18] <Uhkis> stop objectifying javascript! :-D
[08:59:22] <jak2000> hi all
[08:59:40] <anotheryou> Cork, but I can say: myStuff = $('#thing'); thisStuff = myStuff; thisStuff.css(...); ?
[08:59:48] <robertmaxrees> anotheryou huh?
[09:00:04] <Cork> anotheryou: sure, you are just copying the object reference there
[09:00:04] <robertmaxrees> anotheryou what are you actually trying to do?  Why are you trying to move vars around?
[09:00:14] <Cork> you are actually having two variables working with the exact same object
[09:00:27] <anotheryou> great. yes. I'm doing a little carousel and need to juggle two divs :) robertmaxrees
[09:00:28] <robertmaxrees> and making your code really hard to read.
[09:00:34] <robertmaxrees> that... doens’t make sense.
[09:00:49] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[09:01:04] <anotheryou> robertmaxrees, I got currentDiv and bottomDiv and both change roles on interaction...
[09:01:31] <anotheryou> robertbusy, on click() bottom becomes top and top becomes bottom (only more complicated with animation and stuff)
[09:06:40] <pyCasso> cork: why did you choose to use map oppose to each?
[09:06:56] <Cork> pyCasso: cleaner code
[09:08:39] <anotheryou> ai. the .length doesn't work for me. I cant to see if my var currentDiv == $("#div0") or if it is $("#div1"). on both length == 1
[09:08:47] <anotheryou> I want to see
[09:08:48] <pyCasso> i found this to be clean too. https://jsfiddle.net/5q1032qd/6/
[09:09:35] <pyCasso> Cork: im new to js coming from python and php.
[09:14:09] <anotheryou> ah, comparing mySelector[0] worked
[09:29:43] <anotheryou> Cork, robertbusy this is what I tried to do, which works now (scroll or swipe) http://malea.lacerta.uberspace.de/quickup/html_schmockup/ thank you :)
[09:29:46] <adv_> i want to use my existing grid layout and use masonry/isotope only for the 'moving items around' stuff. can i do this?
[09:31:52] <robertmaxrees> adv_ sure - why wouldn’t you be able to
[09:31:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[09:32:11] <adv_> i don't know, i just discovered masonry/isotope
[09:32:25] <robertmaxrees> you can point it at a particular area on a page.
[09:33:01] <adv_> i have 50+ items, would that be a problem?
[09:33:12] <robertmaxrees> that’s ephemeral.  maybe?  not sure.
[09:34:32] <robertmaxrees> lol i’ll let you finish up in the other channel ;)
[09:41:42] <abacuspowers> hi all, I'm having a weird little issue with iframes. can't seem to grab the full src URL from WITHIN the iframe... any ideas? I want the iframe to handle a query string, but can't get it working.
[09:42:03] <robertmaxrees> abacuspowers of the parent window?
[09:42:18] <abacuspowers> no. I want the URL of itself
[09:42:38] <robertmaxrees> that’d just be the window.location.href
[09:42:49] <robertmaxrees> if you’re loading the script inside of the iframe.
[09:43:04] <abacuspowers> unfortunately, window.location doesn't include anything after the ?
[09:43:29] <robertmaxrees> that’s why you use window.location.href
[09:43:54] <abacuspowers> sorry, that's what I meant. window.location.href cuts off before the "?"
[09:44:01] <robertmaxrees> not for me.
[09:44:22] <abacuspowers> hmm... okay. I'll take another look. thanks for your input
[09:44:47] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location for more info.
[09:45:19] <codecutter> its been awhile since i used jquery. Can somebody help out with this error? http://pastebin.com/bgEREdgN
[09:45:35] <robertmaxrees> codecutter show us your code.
[09:45:47] <codecutter> see the script
[09:46:03] <robertmaxrees> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/less.js/2.5.1/less.js is erroring?
[09:46:04] <codecutter> its my could, error is coming from less library
[09:46:19] <codecutter> yes, thats the script that is throwing the error
[09:46:27] <robertmaxrees> i see a stack trace and a link to LESS - not your code.
[09:46:37] <codecutter> right.
[09:46:39] <robertmaxrees> do you still get the error if you remove your code?
[09:47:02] <codecutter> well, i thknk the script is complaining about my setup
[09:47:48] <robertmaxrees> codecutter you basically haven’t given me enough information.  i don’t know what you’re doing/how you’re using things/etc - mind showing us how to replicate the error?
[09:48:11] <codecutter> ofcourse
[09:49:57] <abacuspowers> robertmaxress, I just realized I forgot to mention that this is a cross-origin iframe
[09:50:29] <robertmaxrees> abacuspowers let’s clarify then: is the js inside the iframe?
[09:50:30] <robertmaxrees> and it’
[09:50:38] <robertmaxrees> *it’s trying to read the href of the iframe itself?
[09:50:42] <abacuspowers> correct
[09:51:00] <robertmaxrees> then you’re not violating CORS
[09:51:15] <robertmaxrees> the JS is staying within its sandbox
[09:51:36] <abacuspowers> hmm, well, window.location.href doesn't give me anything beyond the "?". this is weird...
[09:51:46] <robertmaxrees> what’s the src of the iframe?
[09:51:54] <robertmaxrees> because something isn’t adding up.
[09:52:53] <abacuspowers> looks like this: <iframe id="login-iframe"  src="http://example.com/login-connector/example?breakpoint=small"></iframe>
[09:53:22] <codecutter> 1) create a .less file and link it to html page  e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" th:href="/foo.less" type="text/less" media="screen" />
[09:53:22] <codecutter> 2) add the less.js script to the bottom of the html file (script translates the less file to css) <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/less.js/2.5.1/less.js" type="text/javascript">&#160;</script>
[09:53:22] <codecutter> 2) add jquery library next <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js" type="text/javascript">&#160;</script>
[09:53:22] <codecutter> 4) load the html in browser, for me the "less" script complains - http://pastebin.com/bgEREdgN
[09:53:31] <robertmaxrees> codecutter woah
[09:54:24] <robertmaxrees> codecutter sounds like the issue is with LESS then, not jQuery
[09:54:26] <abacuspowers> hmmm... y'know I think there may be a redirect happening.
[09:54:31] <codecutter> whoa, indeed
[09:54:40] <codecutter> right.
[09:54:41] <robertmaxrees> codecutter the “woah” was because you did a multiline paste ;)
[09:55:20] <codecutter> i was hoping someone can interpret the error for me.
[09:55:37] <codecutter> my jquery is a little fuzzy
[09:55:37] <robertmaxrees> abacuspowers that would explain it.
[09:55:57] <abacuspowers> haha yep. thanks for your help.
[09:57:48] <robertmaxrees> codecutter two things: 1: this isn’t a jquery issue, it’s a LESS issue - 2: the error is self-explanatory - "http://localhost:8080/stylesheets/less/style.less" probably isn’t a less file - see the undefined1: "<!doctype html>" bit?
[09:58:43] <codecutter> why is it reading the html instead of thhe less file?
[09:58:53] <codecutter> "<!doctype html>" belongs to the html
[09:58:56] <codecutter> hmm
[09:59:00] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you hit that URL and open the page source?
[09:59:21] <codecutter> if enter url directly it just load the html page
[09:59:27] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:59:29] <robertmaxrees> that’s invalid.
[09:59:37] <robertmaxrees> that URL needs to serve the less file instead.
[09:59:58] <codecutter> maybe a path, issue
[10:00:06] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it.
[10:01:25] <codecutter> thanks
[10:01:50] <codecutter> an explaination of the error was what I was after.
[10:05:58] <robertmaxrees> i was just guessing.
[10:30:11] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:30:21] <robertmaxrees> heloooooo
[10:32:30] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: sup?
[10:32:53] <robertmaxrees> not a whole lot.  kicking around at some stuff.
[10:32:55] <robertmaxrees> you?
[10:37:47] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: I played code golf today.
[10:37:54] <robertmaxrees> cool
[10:38:01] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?differentiation - I am "shlomif" there.
[10:38:24] <robertmaxrees> very cool
[10:40:46] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: maybe I'll work on my JS code today too. It also uses jQuery.
[10:57:35] <jak2000> hi friends,  i have a problem, i pasted my code: http://pastebin.com/Lf3fqEyN   and then try explain, i add a row to a Html table: see lines: 169 to 386, this task is done OK, work fine, if you see in the line: 327 i add a button with a class: 'cBtnBorrar' this button/class was defined: in line 166, here my problem when the user click on button not happend anything (and the console not help
[10:57:35] <jak2000> me), a friend tell me: (<lf94> jak2000, well the alert isnt shown because the event is not firing.    and      <lf94> jquery is not loaded yet, so $ is not a function.    any advice why not display the alert? thanks
[10:58:25] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[10:59:16] <jak2000> hi robertmaxrees... i have a fiddle and work fine... but when translate to my production code not work :(
[11:00:25] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rb8a8bw9/3/
[11:01:05] <jak2000> the main diference fiddle and my code is: i have a file named x.js and i declared it on my html page at under <title> not know if its ok
[11:01:27] <taplar> you'll need to include jquery first
[11:01:41] <jak2000> taplar yes i know
[11:02:14] <jak2000> and i do other operations... on my html page.. (sumarizze, coloring, etc..) but this button not say the alert..
[11:02:42] <taplar> is your logic in a document ready?
[11:03:10] <jak2000> yes
[11:03:17] <jak2000> see please: http://pastebin.com/PTtbzNRx
[11:03:46] <jak2000> and here: jspallentex.js     http://pastebin.com/Lf3fqEyN
[11:17:16] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:18:39] <lindii_> what i might be missing here to make the last part of the email like .au .uk optional ^([^@\s]+)@((gmail|yahoo|hotmail)\.+[a-z]{2,}+(\.[a-z\d\-]+))$
[11:20:34] <taplar> lindii_: not sure you want the + on '\.+'.  that would look for one or more periods
[11:20:55] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ just mailcheck and call it a day.
[11:22:36] <lindii_> taplar: like foobar@hotmail.com is valid and foobar@hotmail.com.uk can also be valid. this way foobar@hotmail.com.uk is only valid
[11:23:01] <taplar> \.+ would allow hotmail.............com.uk
[11:23:27] <lindii_> and also hotmail.com?
[11:23:30] <taplar> sure
[11:25:22] <NoiseEee> validating email addresses is a kind of useless task
[11:25:26] <NoiseEee> certainly via a regex
[11:25:27] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[11:25:37] <NoiseEee> look for an @ sign
[11:25:39] <robertmaxrees> your best bet is to suggest some things.
[11:25:39] <NoiseEee> thats about it.
[11:25:47] <robertmaxrees> make sure it’s roughly valid.  and then leave it alone.
[11:25:58] <robertmaxrees> you can’t account for all of the TLDs in existence.
[11:26:17] <NoiseEee> your backend should be notifying your system that the email is invalid when it gets a bounceback, and/or the user does not confirm something via a link sent to that email address
[11:26:34] <`ULT-sleep> Hi, I have a question! When effects (like a toggle) are running slow/ not realy smooth
[11:26:43] <`ULT-sleep> what can be the reasons therefore?
[11:29:06] <`ULT-sleep> and now it is running smooth.
[11:29:10] <`ULT-sleep> any sugestions?
[11:29:14] <`ULT-sleep> is it some pc issues?
[11:29:17] <taplar> what changed?
[11:29:17] <`ULT-sleep> or ie
[11:29:21] <`ULT-sleep> not anything
[11:29:26] <taplar> something had to change
[11:29:40] <`ULT-sleep> no :p
[11:30:10] <`ULT-sleep> taplar, I have everything working? :D
[11:30:15] <`ULT-sleep> would you see the code?
[11:30:34] <taplar> share with the room.  anyone who is inclinded can help you
[11:31:07] <`ULT-sleep> yeah: https://jsfiddle.net/shhp8x4p/10/
[11:31:39] <`ULT-sleep> there are a few little things
[11:32:55] <`ULT-sleep> when add a product (press checkbox) the price is added on Total accessies
[11:33:26] <`ULT-sleep> when updating that product (changing a option) you see updating the product price and the total accessories price
[11:33:51] <taplar> yup
[11:33:56] <`ULT-sleep> but the animation is first running ong the product price, and after that on the total accessories price
[11:34:07] <taplar> yup
[11:34:14] <`ULT-sleep> Can the animation "blink" at the same time?
[11:35:43] <`ULT-sleep> and is there a way to test the performance of the code?
[11:35:52] <robertmaxrees> yep - you can profile it.
[11:35:53] <`ULT-sleep> I have tried this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now
[11:36:01] <robertmaxrees> your dev tools will have ways to do that.
[11:36:05] <robertmaxrees> chrome is really strong for that.
[11:36:19] <`ULT-sleep> but the values didnt say me alot
[11:36:46] <robertmaxrees> you want to use the profiling tools in your browser, not part of the console api.
[11:36:48] <robertmaxrees> or whatever
[11:37:10] <`ULT-sleep> aah oke robertmaxrees
[11:37:12] <`ULT-sleep> thanks.
[11:37:52] <`ULT-sleep> do you have a good link for it?
[11:39:25] <mllzp> Why isn't there a toggleClass( "class", fn ) signature?
[11:39:46] <taplar> what's the use case?
[11:39:58] <arthurvr> mllzp: there may be one in the future. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2306
[11:44:24] <`ULT-sleep> taplar, would you want to test the toggle on this page for me? http://www.kaskeus.nl/tuinkeus/index.php?route=product/product&path=32&product_id=313 (Klik en selecteer uw uitvoering.)
[11:44:47] <`ULT-sleep> now it is not running smooth anymore at my pc
[11:44:52] <taplar> so same thing?  checkbox, options changing and such?
[11:45:18] <mllzp> cool thank you
[11:45:19] <`ULT-sleep> yes
[11:45:35] <`ULT-sleep> such things if you want :)
[11:45:55] <`ULT-sleep> and look expespecially
[11:46:00] <`ULT-sleep> *especially
[11:46:03] <taplar> the animations are smooth for me, but yeah, there is still a delay in the fades
[11:46:19] <`ULT-sleep> oke the toggling animation is smooth? :)
[11:46:20] <`ULT-sleep> thanks
[11:46:34] <`ULT-sleep> the delay in fades need to changed
[11:46:56] <`ULT-sleep> the problem is I am calling a function with also a fade in it
[11:47:09] <`ULT-sleep> after clicking and the first fade is already finished
[11:47:43] <`ULT-sleep> It is in this part: $subTotal.parent().fadeOut(300, function () {
[11:47:43] <`ULT-sleep>         $subTotal.html((+$subTotal.html() + adjustment).toFixed(2)).parent().fadeIn(300);
[11:47:43] <`ULT-sleep>         sumTotalProductprice();
[11:47:54] <robertmaxrees> `ULT-sleep hey avoid pasting code in the channel please :)\
[11:48:01] <`ULT-sleep> allright
[11:48:45] <Lencl> is jqm known to be buggy?
[11:48:57] <robertmaxrees> if used right, not really.
[11:51:14] <Lencl> I have this: pastebin.com/fZJXeMPX
[11:51:19] <rindolf> Why do some JS devs prefix their lexical variables with $? Like "$subTotal"? AFAIK, it's unnecessary.
[11:51:35] <robertmaxrees> rindolf i do it to signify if it’s a jquery object.
[11:51:36] <taplar> i prefer it as it lets me know if i've already wrapped an object
[11:51:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:52:18] <robertmaxrees> not necessary, but a nice way to prevent doing $($($($(‘.someSelector’)))) unnecessarily.
[11:52:19] <Lencl> I didn't put it on jsfiddle cause it does work on there... When I put it on my website, nothing shows. When I view source, the <label> disappears. What can make that happen? pastebin.com/fZJXeMPX
[11:52:29] <taplar> so $variable is only as significant as myArray or anObject
[11:52:30] <Lencl> *disappeared
[11:52:32] <robertmaxrees> Lencl any console errors?
[11:53:07] <Lencl> robertmaxrees, I'll double check
[11:53:54] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: I see.
[11:53:59] <Lencl> yeah, no console errors :\
[11:54:08] <robertmaxrees> Lencl without seeing it break it’s hard to help.
[12:19:51] <SmashingX2> I had this cancel button in popups <a href="#" data-role="button" data-inline="true" data-rel="back">Cancel</a>
[12:20:08] <SmashingX2> but this was making the popup not close but going back the page before the popup
[12:20:18] <SmashingX2> so I changed to this <a data-role="button" data-inline="true" onclick="$(this).closest('[data-role=popup]').popup('close');">Cancel</a>
[12:20:28] <SmashingX2> but it’s still doing the same thing
[12:24:26] <jphase> SmashingX2: don't use onclick attributes to bind your jQuery events, just add a class or id and bind with jQuery
[12:25:09] <jphase> or select in another way - hard to say without seeing
[12:29:04] <FalsAlarm> does this look right? <script src="includes/jquery-1.11.3.js"></script>
[12:30:20] <jphase> FalsAlarm: I mean, it's a script tag...
[12:30:30] <jphase> with a moldy version of jQuery probably
[12:30:33] <jphase> why do you ask?
[12:32:35] <FalsAlarm> it's not working
[12:32:43] <FalsAlarm> maybe my slash is the wrong one in the path
[12:34:25] <FalsAlarm> nm
[12:34:31] <FalsAlarm> i moved the file and now it's working
[12:39:35] <FalsAlarm> if i had a form with inputs
[12:39:42] <FalsAlarm> has only 1 actually
[12:39:52] <FalsAlarm> i want to dynamically add more inputs on button click
[12:39:59] <FalsAlarm> do i use append?
[12:41:26] <Zzaichik> try it and find out
[12:43:00] <FalsAlarm> what did i do wrong?
[12:43:01] <FalsAlarm> http://pastebin.com/wZNRmBRe
[12:43:14] <FalsAlarm> my syntax is broken somewhere but i don't know where?
[12:43:24] <Zzaichik> quotes
[12:43:34] <Zzaichik> around the id's
[12:44:18] <Zzaichik> .click(function() { … is sufficient
[12:44:36] <FalsAlarm> ok i'll add quotes
[12:44:41] <Zzaichik> …and input's don't have a closing tag
[12:46:40] <FalsAlarm> Zzaichik, what did i do wrong now? http://pastebin.com/tVggHQjw
[12:46:52] <FalsAlarm> notice i have my event handler wired up correctly, i think
[12:47:05] <Zzaichik> I'm not searching for it yo
[12:47:07] <FalsAlarm> when i click the add button, nothing happened
[12:47:10] <FalsAlarm> happens
[12:47:18] <FalsAlarm> ok i'll repaste
[12:47:50] <FalsAlarm> http://pastebin.com/bwDHF61f
[12:47:58] <FalsAlarm> Zzaichik
[12:48:03] <Zzaichik> I'd put it in the $(document).ready(
[12:48:09] <Zzaichik> and inputs don't have a closing tag
[12:48:17] <FalsAlarm> ok
[12:48:25] <Zzaichik> Is there more than one #inputs?
[12:49:48] <FalsAlarm> actually, i found the problem
[12:49:58] <FalsAlarm> i was using name="addButton" instead of id=
[12:50:03] <FalsAlarm> working now
[12:50:06] <Zzaichik> nice.
[12:50:12] <FalsAlarm> thx
[12:50:15] <Zzaichik> yep
[12:51:12] <Zzaichik> .append('<input type="text" />'); @FalsAlarm
[12:54:07] <Zzaichik> @FalsAlarm I might also suggest using .after() instead of .append(), depending on where you want that input.
[12:55:21] <FalsAlarm> i was gonna stick a line break after it, seems to work
[12:55:41] <Zzaichik> Cool - append will put it as a child element, where .after() makes it a sibling
[12:55:54] <Zzaichik> ¿esta bien?
[13:00:54] <FalsAlarm> Zzaichik, my $_POST array is coming back empty
[13:01:00] <FalsAlarm> after i submit the form
[13:01:08] <FalsAlarm> even though the inputs are there
[13:01:55] <robertmaxrees> do they all have names?
[13:03:57] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, no they don't
[13:04:08] <FalsAlarm> what kind of name should i assign the dynamic inputs?
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> names that represent the content they hold?
[13:05:51] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, just as long as the names are unique, i don't care
[13:05:59] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> then give them unique names?
[13:06:08] <FalsAlarm> how
[13:06:11] <robertmaxrees> i wasn’t here earlier so i don’t know exactly what you’re doing.
[13:06:56] <FalsAlarm> http://pastebin.com/29pJ4EEh
[13:07:08] <FalsAlarm> notice my code only allows for one name
[13:07:18] <FalsAlarm> they all get assigned that name
[13:07:25] <robertmaxrees> what data do these hold?
[13:07:38] <FalsAlarm> category names
[13:08:11] <robertmaxrees> could have an incrementer of some kind.  alternatively, you could massage this info and have one input, depending on how weird you want to get.
[13:09:35] <FalsAlarm> how do i get an incrementer
[13:10:12] <robertmaxrees> could get the current number of inputs and add one.  that might be one way.
[13:11:08] <SmashingX2> I have a html button which is calling a js code: http://pastie.org/private/wnu8ysct75i184pa1yxvw but that javascript code is not beign called, I can see that when I set a debug point with devtools in Chrome. Any ideas what this would be?
[13:11:21] <robertmaxrees> FalsAlarm http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r2qa0az7/
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 using onclick= is a bad idea - use .on() instead.
[13:12:13] <SmashingX2> yeah but I wonder what’s happening in this case
[13:12:17] <SmashingX2> particular case
[13:12:28] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[13:12:37] <SmashingX2> yes I got an error
[13:12:51] <SmashingX2> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
[13:12:51] <robertmaxrees> i’m guessing it’s “ws is undefined” or something like that?
[13:13:09] <SmashingX2> no because I’m using it in another page and is working fine
[13:13:10] <Zzaichik> .editPopup(this,',id,') those single quotes look off
[13:13:20] <robertmaxrees> hah, that too.
[13:13:20] <SmashingX2> I mean not that function but other function inside of we
[13:13:22] <SmashingX2> ws
[13:13:36] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees thx i'll try it. could i do all this in the document ready function>?
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> FalsAlarm you could add the binding there, sure...
[13:14:17] <`ULT> hi, does someone knows what this means? XHR finished loading: GET "
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> `ULT sounds like ajax.
[13:14:35] <`ULT> it is in console > debug
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 also, ws wouldn’t be defined in that onclick, too.
[13:15:00] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/866ahs
[13:15:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that’s basic debug information - something is doing some ajax.
[13:15:27] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees whats e.preventDefault(); do?
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> no harm no foul.
[13:15:36] <`ULT> oke, so i dont need to fix it
[13:15:41] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery preventDefault
[13:15:42] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: event.preventDefault() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> FalsAlarm ^
[13:15:51] <robertmaxrees> `ULT it’s debugging info :)
[13:16:01] <`ULT> allright :p
[13:22:00] <django_> looking at this: $('#abc').attr('src', 'images/x-end.png'); how can i do #id span {}
[13:22:04] <django_> through jquery
[13:22:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:22:21] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, ok it sorta kinda works
[13:22:30] <FalsAlarm> except i'm only receiving category_2 value
[13:22:38] <FalsAlarm> the rest aren't available yet
[13:22:42] <robertmaxrees> FalsAlarm i’d need to see more of your code.
[13:22:45] <robertmaxrees> like, a fiddle.
[13:27:41] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, ok
[13:31:03] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/pp1z2s3h/1/
[13:34:08] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, do you know whats going on with my code why it's not working?
[13:37:44] <robertmaxrees> var currentNumberOfInputs = $form.find('input').length; runs once on pageload.
[13:37:52] <robertmaxrees> that needs to be in the event handler.
[13:41:40] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, ok thanks, got it working now
[13:44:17] <FalsAlarm> robertmaxrees, how do i loop through the post array getting all values except the 'submit' value\
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> FalsAlarm in PHP?
[13:44:33] <robertmaxrees> no idea.
[13:52:25] <jphase> FalsAlarm: in your for loop just check if the value is 'submit' and then continue; if it is
[13:52:36] <skinux> For some reason my app is printing Spreadsheet data to console, but isn't printing stuff I've told it to. Need some help https://github.com/skinuxgeek/candilog/blob/master/public/lib/application-spreadsheet.js
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> skinux you mean console.log = response; ?
[13:53:22] <skinux> Huh?
[13:53:29] <robertmaxrees> what line are you having issue with?
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> also: are you filtering out console messages?
[13:54:07] <skinux> I don't know why it's printing out the spreadsheet data as arrays. And that is supposed to be console.log(response)
[13:54:38] <robertmaxrees> which particular line are you having problems with, then?
[13:54:40] <skinux> Everything I'm doing is in the source I posted, if it's not it's in app.js which is also on the repo
[13:55:14] <skinux> robertmaxrees: There is no error. It's simply printing out spreadsheet rows as arrays and NOT printing out the messages I've told it to print.
[13:55:48] <robertmaxrees> i’m lost.  sorry!
[13:56:00] <skinux> Maybe I have something in the wrong place or doing something stupid, I'm not sure. I'm a newbie to using JS/jQuery
[13:56:10] <robertmaxrees> so where, specifically, is your issue?
[13:56:25] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i’m missing something here - what console log isn’t doing what you’re expecting?
[13:56:32] <skinux> I don't have a line number to give you.
[13:56:59] <robertmaxrees> “It's simply printing out spreadsheet rows as arrays and NOT printing out the messages I've told it to print.” - what have you told it to print?
[13:57:03] <robertmaxrees> where did you do that?
[13:57:14] <skinux> That's just it! I haven't told it to do that ANYWHERE
[13:57:30] <skinux> That's why I'm asking for help because I don't understand.
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> i see like 3 console log statements, so those would print data.
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> also, you have some errors in your code - beforeSend: function(jqXHR xhr, PlainObject settings) { isn’t what you want.
[14:13:20] <skinux> robertmaxrees: I updated the repo as you pointed out it was behind.
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> beforeSend: function(xhr, settings) {
[14:14:42] <robertmaxrees> that’s the method signature.
[14:14:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, what isn’t working here?
[14:19:14] <skinux> neither console.log statements actually works. For some reason, the data in the spreadsheet is being output to console as two arrays. That is the best I can say because there are no errors, it's simply those two console.log statements not doing anything and the weird data output.
[14:20:32] <robertmaxrees> so what are you expecting to happen?
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> since i’m flying blind right now.
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/508c823b059e
[14:21:17] <robertmaxrees> try this maybe?>
[14:21:50] <skinux> It SHOULD NOT be outputing the damn spreadsheet data as arrays to console, and those two console.log statements should be PRINTING something to console. That is what I expect!!!
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> is that what console.log(hot.getData()); is doing?
[14:22:50] <robertmaxrees> outputting the data?
[14:23:09] <robertmaxrees> i’m flying blind here :)
[14:26:48] <skinux> Repo updated. Now I'm getting "unexpected token u" for line 57
[14:28:51] <robertmaxrees> what does the repsonse look like?
[14:30:23] <skinux> I don't know, the console.log statements still aren't doing anything and the spreadsheet arrays are still being printed to console.
[14:30:49] <skinux> The new code didn't solve the issue, only added another one.
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> i’m wondering if your data is poorly formed coming from the server.
[14:31:43] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/acd002d98e30
[14:31:58] <robertmaxrees> i mean... no clue what else to do without rewriting things for you at this point.
[14:32:48] <robertmaxrees> you could also check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1, which is a pretty excellent guide.
[14:33:28] <skinux> FFS! Line 48 has the console.log that is printing spreadsheet data
[14:34:06] <robertmaxrees> i asked you about that a while ago.
[14:34:27] <skinux> Now, it's just the token error
[14:35:03] <skinux> I don't even know what token it's talking about. Something must be a token that I don't realize.
[14:35:36] <robertmaxrees> what does the error say?
[14:35:55] <skinux> Uncaught SyntaxError: unexpected token u
[14:36:20] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the data getting passed to JSON.parse() is bad.
[14:43:47] <skinux> That could be.
[14:44:19] <robertmaxrees> that’s probably what it is.
[14:44:33] <skinux> This is the string sent from the server (which is turned into JSON before sending) "["status"=>"Saved"]"
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> that’s your issue.
[14:44:50] <robertmaxrees> that’s not JSON.
[14:45:14] <skinux> No, it's a PHP array which I'm turning into JSON
[14:45:23] <robertmaxrees> so then what gets sent to the browseR?
[14:45:37] <skinux> ["status":"Saved"] I've thought
[14:45:45] <robertmaxrees> that’s still invalid JSON.
[14:45:51] <robertmaxrees> check in your network tab in your dev tools.
[14:46:26] <skinux> This is the response {"status":"Saved"}
[14:46:33] <robertmaxrees> then drop the JSON.parse()
[14:46:35] <robertmaxrees> it’s not a string.
[15:12:44] <skinux> I just can't get the data right to turn to JSON for this.
[15:13:38] <fas3r> hello
[15:14:31] <fas3r> is it possible to add additional data to be send in a form which is already serialized ?
[15:14:58] <robertmaxrees> you’d have to append it into the serialized data.
[15:17:15] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: like creating hidden input ?
[15:17:19] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[15:17:29] <fas3r> because I want to avoid that.
[15:17:35] <fas3r> I mean hidden input.
[15:17:57] <robertmaxrees> then append it to the serialized data.
[15:18:17] <fas3r> yes but how ?
[15:18:22] <fas3r> :)
[15:18:26] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:18:31] <robertmaxrees> it’s pretty basic :)
[15:22:54] <Synthead> in jquery ui, is there a way to make overflowed objects to display a scroll bar?  for starters, it would be nice to have this with autocomplete
[15:24:58] <robertmaxrees> that’s a CSS change.  could apple that yourself.
[15:25:23] <robertmaxrees> *apply
[15:25:46] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: ah, cool!  and yes, I found this: https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/maxheight.html
[15:25:52] <Synthead> this is great, thanks a lot!
[15:26:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:43:43] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: thats just one word
[15:43:46] <acidjazz> you dont really need a period
[15:44:04] <arc_> -_-;
[15:44:14] <robertmaxrees> you ain’t the boss of me.
[15:44:19] <acidjazz> you're not my real dad.
[15:48:37] <Synthead> you're not my friiiieeend, paaaal!
[16:18:30] <Synthead> when an autocomplete menu is rendered, is there a way I can select the menu to do some js on it?  event.target in the events seem to only have the input field
[17:15:53] <tasaif> I want to run an http server in a particular directory on windows
[17:16:10] <tasaif> this may be the wrong room
[17:17:30] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:17:40] <shoky> tasaif: i use node.js's http-server module for that.  npm install -g http-server   and then you just run  http-server in the directory
[17:17:56] <shoky> tasaif: and python has  "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
[17:18:14] <shoky> assuming you just want a simple server for dev
[17:18:19] <tasaif> I neglected to mention I also need it to run php
[17:18:24] <shoky> derp
[17:18:44] <tasaif> ikr
[17:18:47] <shoky> uhm. XAMP? i dunno
[17:19:30] <tasaif> I'd prefer to go with something in my package manager (cygwin) my options are httpd (apache) lighttpd micro-httpd and dhttpd
[17:19:45] <tasaif> I'm worried httpd is going to install as a service and start with the computer or some nonsense.
[17:19:46] <shoky> oks go for apache
[17:20:00] <robertmaxrees> err, cygwin isn’t a package manager.
[17:20:09] <tasaif> it's not
[17:20:21] <robertmaxrees> “ <tasaif> I'd prefer to go with something in my package manager (cygwin)”
[17:20:35] <tasaif> cygwin has a package manager right?
[17:20:43] <tasaif> via its setup.exe
[17:20:43] <shoky> that could be read as  (in cygwin)
[17:20:44] <shoky> ya
[17:21:13] <robertmaxrees> it’s just a bunch of tools.  it’s got a package manager in it, sure.  just weird to put that differently :)
[17:21:36] <tasaif> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:21:38] <robertmaxrees> there’s also chocolatey if you want a windows package manager.
[17:21:47] <tasaif> orly?
[17:21:58] <robertmaxrees> https://chocolatey.org/
[17:21:59] <robertmaxrees> si
[17:22:47] <tasaif> looks interesting
[17:22:55] <tasaif> I'll have to look into it later
[17:22:57] <robertmaxrees> also: why do you need php?
[17:23:08] <tasaif> that's what the client is using
[17:23:09] <shoky> ;o that install command looks scary
[17:23:19] <tasaif> powershell dawg
[17:23:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:24:01] <tasaif> I guess I'll go with apache
[17:24:15] <robertmaxrees> or nginx.  apache’s a safe bet though
[17:25:11] <tasaif> I should be able to do something like "httpd ./public_html"
[17:25:13] <tasaif> right?
[17:25:34] <shoky> depends, are you dreaming, or not
[17:26:02] <shoky> honestly i don't remember been a while since i've apache'd, but i remember it was nothing as simple as that ;p
[17:26:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, lots of configs ‘n things
[17:26:15] <shoky> config files woohoo
[17:27:26] <tasaif> lol it is a service
[17:27:30] <tasaif> at least it's not started by default
[17:32:23] <albeR> hello
[17:34:35] <robertmaxrees> hello
[17:36:56] <albeR> I'm submitting a form with $.post method. The data are serialized and declare as follow in the method : data : Mydata       where Mydata is the object to submit. However, on server side I have to check $_POST['data']['Myvar'] insteada of $_POST['Myvar']. Any idea ?
[17:37:36] <robertmaxrees> show the actual code pls
[17:37:44] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle if possible.
[17:41:34] <albeR> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/1e1cMG34
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> $(formSerialize).each(function(index, obj) { - not a good idea.
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> could you share what formSerialize looks like?
[17:42:28] <albeR> sure
[17:42:56] <robertmaxrees> and what you want the data to be formatted as in dataFormated ?
[17:54:21] <albeR> robertmaxrees: I just did a new test,  I have the same problem anyway by using serialize instead of serializearray. the data are sent  like this : data: val1=test&val2=test instead of : val1=test val2=test
[17:54:36] <albeR> I think the problem come from the $.post
[17:54:46] <albeR> maybe I should use $.ajax instead directly
[17:54:58] <robertmaxrees> i think you’re confused by what those methods do.
[17:55:21] <robertmaxrees> serialize -> Description: Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission.
[17:55:36] <robertmaxrees> serializeArray -> Description: Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values.
[17:55:41] <robertmaxrees> you likely want the latter.
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> and then use a .forEach() to get things into your different format.
[17:58:43] <albeR> robertmaxrees: I was right, the problem came from the $.post
[17:59:41] <albeR> I was doing $.post(url, { data: formSerialize } , json) ... which is wrong.. I don't need to put { data : ...}
[17:59:44] <albeR> my bad.
[18:00:13] <albeR> I just need to put the serialize or serializearray element directly.
[18:12:24] <tasaif> so httpd isn't panning out. time to try lighttpd
[18:28:03] <tasaif> lighttpd isn't panning out
