[02:00:08] <Tools> Hello, I have the following issue https://hidden.network/html.html <- There is a <li> which class I want to set to active if the <li> in the following <ul> is also set to active (the example explains is better I think)
[02:00:52] <Tools> I was thinking along the lines of $('.active').parent().parent().filter("li:first").addClass("active"); but I'm not able to get that to work
[02:02:11] <Tools> And if that would work, then it wouldn't work for the li's lower in the sidebar
[03:43:31] <AdamPDotty> $('.active').closest('li').addClass('active');
[03:45:47] <AdamPDotty> Tools: plus fix your code
[04:36:59] <jomofcw> Hello !
[04:37:28] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get the position of an element relative to an other, please ?
[04:38:17] <jomofcw> something like the ".poisition()" method that would accept an argument (https://api.jquery.com/position/).
[04:41:44] <Cork> jomofcw: grab .offset() of both elements and then subtrack with the .offset() from the parent you want relative to
[04:43:08] <jomofcw> Cork OK that's how I plan to do it, just asking if there was an "easiest" way (a built-in one). Thanks !
[04:46:12] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get all the parents that has the css property "overflow" set to something else than "visible", please ?
[04:46:30] <Cork> not in an efficient way
[04:46:31] <jomofcw> I can do it using a "each", but it sounds like an heavy process.
[04:46:39] <Cork> you have to loop all parents, or set a class
[04:46:57] <Cork> if you have a class you can do .parents('.with-overflow')
[04:48:34] <jomofcw> Cork OK, thanks ^^.
[04:50:25] <jomofcw> Back to my previous question : ".position()" method on my "LI" (position:relative) which is in the "UL" positionned "relative" give me the same result than the ".offset()" method here. ".position" only give position other than relative to the document when the element is positioned absolute, right ?
[04:50:31] <jomofcw> Dunno if it's clear :s.
[04:50:49] <Rockwood> i am getting undefined error in console https://jsfiddle.net/s1x9awdg/
[04:51:49] <Cork> jomofcw: position() gives offset to the closest parent resetting offset
[04:52:13] <Cork> what position value the element you run it on has doens't matter
[04:53:10] <Cork> Rockwood: you almost guaranteed don't want to look for an attribute .answerselected=""
[04:53:42] <jomofcw> Cork OK, thanks.
[04:54:18] <Cork> Rockwood: the html is incomplete or invalid so it is hard to say what you would have to select for
[05:05:49] <Rockwood> Cork, i have multi choice objective scenario
[05:06:26] <Cork> Rockwood: and what do you actually want to do with answerId = $(this).attr('.answerselected');  ?
[05:08:40] <Rockwood> if candidate clicked on next then it would be collect selected answer value and send to ajax just
[05:08:44] <Rockwood> Cork,
[05:09:07] <Cork> Rockwood: so you want to select all .answerselected elements in the page?
[05:09:22] <Rockwood> no just one
[05:09:35] <Cork> ok, and that one would be based on what?
[05:09:58] <Rockwood> user selected
[05:10:14] <Cork> but user selected is the next link when they click it
[05:11:01] <Cork> ah wait you want $('.answerselected:checked')
[05:11:04] <Cork> i guess
[05:11:07] <Rockwood> user click yes
[05:11:16] <Cork> no, clicked isn't possible
[05:11:19] <Rockwood> Cork, yes i want this
[05:11:40] <Cork> but you can get the radio button that is currently checked
[05:12:09] <Rockwood> $('.answerselected:checked').val();
[05:29:07] <jomofcw> I've got an element "created" by a :before{content:""} in my CSS. Is there a way to manage it using jQuery, please ? (I need to position it using JS)
[05:29:21] <Cork> no
[05:29:36] <Cork> :before/:after/:marker isn't elements those are just rendering effects
[05:29:41] <Cork> so you can't find them in the dom
[05:29:54] <jomofcw> Cork OK, thanks.
[05:33:22] <Rockwood> Cork, thanks
[05:33:25] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/wnheL96n/
[05:33:33] <Rockwood> yes i want this
[05:37:40] <Rockwood> Cork, i want one more thing to send to ajax key word next just in post
[05:37:52] <Rockwood> 'next'
[07:31:22] <xinobi> what are my best chances to get the .hidden div https://jsbin.com/sagusoqaze/edit?html,js,output
[07:32:48] <Cork> xinobi: from where?
[07:33:12] <Cork> the dropdown?
[07:33:46] <xinobi> Cork: from #add-location button
[07:34:55] <xinobi> not sure why jsbin is not showing my js code $(document).on("click", "button#add-location", function(){   //get the .hidden class })
[07:35:24] <Cork> (don't add tag names infront of ids)
[07:35:50] <xinobi> Cork: any particular reason?
[07:36:06] <Cork> cause it means you select all buttons in the page and then filter it on the id hash table
[07:36:15] <Cork> instead of just locating the element in the hash table
[07:36:24] <Cork> all ids are unique so you never need anything except the id
[07:36:40] <xinobi> it makes so much sense thanks
[07:36:41] <Cork> button.class-name is a more reasonable thing though
[07:37:08] <Cork> anyway back to the question
[07:37:26] <Cork> you want the hidden element in relation to the button or just the one on the page?
[07:38:07] <Cork> (btw you load two versions of jquery)
[07:39:51] <Cork> xinobi: https://jsfiddle.net/49g5m3fp/
[07:39:53] <Cork> is one option
[07:40:08] <Cork> $('div.hidden') is another
[07:43:49] <xinobi> thanks, about closest I believe it always goes up right? So what if I need to look beneath can i go closest('').find('') ?
[07:44:09] <Cork> nextAll
[07:44:18] <Cork> .find searchs for children or grandchildren
[07:44:31] <Cork> if you want to search before you use prevAll
[07:45:09] <Cork> .next('') gives you the next element if it matches the selector, else nothing
[07:47:00] <xinobi> next goes down to the first occurrence and nextAll goes down and matches all the occurrences?
[07:47:11] <Cork> yes
[07:47:27] <Cork> and .nextAll('selector').first() gives you the first matching
[07:47:35] <xinobi> so prev and prevAll does the opposite?
[07:47:39] <Cork> yes
[07:48:12] <Cork> and .siblings() goes both direction
[07:48:32] <Cork> (might be interesting to have a search in https://api.jquery.com it has good documentation)
[07:49:10] <xinobi> thank you so much
[07:49:15] <Cork> np
[09:19:56] <Justice> Im trying to build a table in jquery however it seems that i cannot populate it during it it just leaves empty tags. https://jsfiddle.net/fpovxmjt/
[09:20:02] <Justice> am I doing something wrong here?
[09:21:20] <Justice> tried text, value, html nothing works for attributes
[09:22:44] <preference> Justice: perhaps this can help? https://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/css/working_w_tables_using_jquery.html
[09:27:43] <Blinky_> afternoon all, after a little help please.  I have this - https://jsfiddle.net/0e17n3xL/ - which works in so far as it places teh value into the input, however, if you select yes and then no you end up with both in green and not just no.  I am struggling to figure out how to have only one of the
[09:27:43] <Blinky_> three options select at any one time.  Any deas?
[09:28:30] <Justice> preference, hm it works with .text() though i need to call append on it differently. hm.
[09:28:39] <Justice> Though i cannot understand why attributes don't work
[09:32:37] <Cork> Blinky_: why not just use a radio element?
[09:36:44] <Cork> Blinky_: https://jsfiddle.net/0e17n3xL/1/
[09:38:17] <Blinky_> Cork, thanks, long day, been trying to use checkboxes as well, forgot about radios. hanging my head in shame
[09:39:13] <Cork> radio buttons are the crem dela crem of css hacks :)
[09:40:06] <Justice> i have spent many hours on stupid radio buttons :P
[09:40:23] <Cork> heh
[09:40:51] <Justice> they don't even exists in Xamarin so you need to build custom renderers....
[09:40:53] <Cork> i use it to make css only slideshows, toggles, tab interfaces and what not :)
[09:42:00] <Justice> Hm
[09:44:21] <Justice> lol is anything supported in html for tables? looking through w3shools and nothing seems to be left.
[09:44:28] <Justice> "attributes"
[09:44:59] <Cork> ya, tables is a big "don't want to touch" for browsers
[09:45:22] <preference> Cork: why is that?
[09:45:31] <Justice> prolly microsoft
[09:45:47] <Cork> cause it is a horrible legacy hack that has been piled on by all vendors for the last 20 years
[09:46:08] <Cork> tables predates the existence css as a concept
[09:46:10] <Justice> I work with ASP and everything is tables and even those dont follow standard layout
[09:46:22] <Cork> this was back in the lovely <font> <center> era
[09:46:39] <Cork> and no microsoft isn't to blame for even most of table
[09:46:58] <Cork> it is actually netscape that concocted most of the rules for the feature
[09:47:14] <Justice> but microsoft continued i mean gridview datagrid etc etc
[09:47:33] <Cork> microsoft started to call there browser agent Mozilla for this reason
[09:47:44] <Justice> i need to create hacks to make em use <table><thead<th> structure
[09:47:46] <Cork> and is actually why we have Mozilla/5.0 in all user agents to day :)
[09:48:15] <Cork> Justice: ya, but those has been removed today
[09:48:21] <Cork> they aren't part of the web standard
[09:48:52] <preference> mozilla firefox is owned by microsoft, Cork ?
[09:50:00] <Cork> preference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)
[09:50:14] <Justice> Cork, isnt thead tbody part of the standard anymore?
[09:50:19] <Cork> and netscape was called mozilla internally all the way back then
[09:50:43] <Cork> Justice: ya, but that is the table standard
[09:51:02] <Cork> error corrections creates them as hidden elements (anonymous) if you don't create them
[09:51:12] <Cork> so they are just optional in the html, they are what the standard use
[09:52:01] <Justice> ah
[09:52:16] <Justice> i use them mostly since all other plugins etc use them too
[09:53:04] <Cork> so if you write <table><tr><td></td></tr></table> what you get is <table><(anonymous)tbody><tr><td></td></tr></(anonymous)tbody></table>
[09:53:24] <Cork> ya, i do too, cause it is how you make sane tables with headers
[09:53:43] <Cork> and as the standard actually requires them (just not in the parser)...
[09:53:58] <Justice> ah
[09:54:23] <Cork> and it becomes anonymous so the scripter can get the elements they expect
[09:54:31] <Cork> so the added elements gets hidden
[09:54:46] <Cork> it is the same thing as if you append <td></td> to the page
[09:55:00] <Justice> btw any ideas why using html or text as attributes when creating tr or td does not work but if I use .text('foo') it does?
[09:55:07] <Cork> you get <(anonymous)table><(anonymous)tbody><(anonymous)tr><td></td></(anonymous)tr></(anonymous)tbody></(anonymous)table>
[09:55:25] <Justice> hm havent actually tried that yet :P
[09:55:43] <Cork> html or text as attributes? what do you mean?
[09:56:05] <Justice> as for hacks i will cry when the day comes and you cannot inject CSS using <style></style> in a dom wherever.
[09:56:16] <Justice> Cork, like so: https://jsfiddle.net/fpovxmjt/
[09:56:26] <Cork> well that is true to day, if you have csp that is
[09:56:27] <Justice> tried html, value, text
[09:56:59] <Cork> .append('<th>', { html: 'Description' }) => .append($('<th>', { html: 'Description' }))
[09:57:20] <Cork> append doesn't accept $() options
[09:57:35] <Cork> it expects string, array of elements or a jquery object
[09:57:49] <Cork> (well or a bare element)
[09:57:57] <Justice> ah that explains it
[09:58:34] <Justice> hm so CSP actually blocks from using style tags inside doom documents?
[09:59:02] <Cork> unless you allow unsafe-style
[09:59:10] <Justice> Because I know browsers 'were' talking about style scoping something like namespaces but never implemented it because reasons
[09:59:16] <Cork> or was it style-eval...
[09:59:18] * Cork checks
[09:59:50] <Justice> what i mean is using <style></style> inside body elements.
[10:00:16] <Cork> style-src: unsafe-inline
[10:00:24] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src
[10:00:27] <Cork> yes
[10:00:38] <Cork> actually the use of <style> at all
[10:00:42] <Cork> or style=""
[10:00:54] <Cork> both requires unsafe-inline
[10:01:10] <Cork> only style accepted if you don't have it set is <link>
[10:02:11] <Justice> o.O
[10:02:54] <Cork> csp can be VERY anal if you let it :)
[10:03:39] <Justice> i hope i will never have it :P The way our system is build kinda would break and fall appart
[10:03:40] <Cork> as far as i know most sites still allow unsafe-inline for style, but not for script
[10:03:54] <Cork> but for highsecurity contexts i have even had it disabled
[10:04:20] <Justice> I mean in ASP we have asp pages that in turn have webcontrols that have their own style sheets for their specific region.
[10:04:21] <Levin^> good morning
[10:04:23] <Cork> what really starts to be interesting then is that thinks like .hide() or .slideDown() is _impossible_
[10:04:49] <Cork> thinks==things
[10:04:55] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/YLYdza?editors=0011
[10:05:01] <Levin^> instructions inside
[10:05:11] <Cork> if you have a question ask it in the channel
[10:05:18] <Levin^> right now, I consider the issue #2 to be more important
[10:05:22] <Cork> don't ask ppl to open links to even know if they can help
[10:05:28] <Levin^> sorry
[10:06:05] <Rockwood> Cork, thanks
[10:06:39] <Cork> Rockwood: ah, np
[10:06:52] <Levin^> in my link, the second issue is saying that my menu is not sliding correctly as the user scrolls the content down
[10:07:20] <Levin^> I'm using scrollLeft to do this, but I'm not entirely sure if I coded it correctly
[10:07:56] <Levin^> the important code starts at line 19 (Waypoints)
[10:09:24] <Cork> Levin^: when is the menu-container suppose to have a vertical scroll?
[10:10:01] <Cork> cause currently it doesn't so changing scrollLeft won't have any effect
[10:10:41] <Cork> (scrollWidth has to be grater then width)
[10:11:15] <Cork> ah, sorry missed a javascript lib
[10:11:24] <Levin^> Cork: it has a horizontal scroll
[10:11:31] <Levin^> oh?
[10:11:45] <Cork> i dont' use codepen much so i was missing an allow rule
[10:11:56] <Levin^> I installed the external scripts there
[10:11:59] <Levin^> oh
[10:13:33] <Cork> so you always want the yellow menu entry to be on the left side of the menu-container?
[10:14:16] <Levin^> yes
[10:16:21] <Cork> Levin^: pop open the console (unless the edit is lost in codepen again) and you should see why you get the behavior
[10:16:58] <Levin^> did you edit it?
[10:17:20] <Cork> ya, but as it is codepen if it sticks or not is random
[10:17:46] <Levin^> oh, well, you need to click on Fork button above
[10:18:01] <Levin^> it'll create a new URL, so you paste it here
[10:18:13] <Cork> ya, the problem is that when you scroll the window you change all the elements left value
[10:18:27] <Cork> and as things are async that will become messy very fast
[10:18:33] <Levin^> hm
[10:18:42] <Levin^> so, how do I write it?
[10:18:56] <Cork> i would use scrollIntoView()
[10:18:59] <Levin^> scrollLeft, based on .menu-container?
[10:19:03] <Levin^> oh
[10:19:07] <Levin^> never used that one
[10:19:11] <Levin^> let me check
[10:19:18] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView
[10:19:36] <Cork> it even has animation on the way in the specs :)
[10:19:48] <Levin^> I removed the animation
[10:20:00] <Levin^> scrollLeft: targetItem.left
[10:20:05] <Cork> scroll are still async
[10:20:10] <Levin^> after this there's a zero
[10:20:15] <Cork> browsers fire scroll event async
[10:20:22] <Levin^> if you put something like 200, it animates
[10:20:23] <Levin^> hmm
[10:20:25] <Levin^> I see
[10:20:54] <Cork> it was quite a few years since you actually halted the scroll action for the user to execute scroll events :)
[10:21:50] <Cork> but scrollIntoView({inline: "start"}) should do what you want
[10:25:04] <Levin^> ok
[10:53:41] <Levin^_> Cork: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gzvXVz?editors=0010
[10:53:54] <Levin^_> the console says $(...).scrollIntoView is not a function
[10:54:14] <Levin^_> I tried several syntaxes and the same error persists
[10:54:46] <Levin^_> that command is experimental feature, as MDN says
[10:55:06] <Levin^_> is there some other command?
[10:56:36] <Justice> speaking of standards
[10:56:54] <Justice> is it script ... defer or script ... defer="defer"
[10:57:27] <Justice> <script type="text/javascript" defer="defer"></script> OR <script type="text/javascript" defer>
[10:58:19] <Justice> ah xhtml vs html
[11:05:14] <Cork> Levin^_: $()[0].scrollIntoView() or $().get(0).scrollIntoView() (what ever you prefer)
[11:05:26] <Cork> scrollIntoView is a dom call not a jquery one
[11:07:21] <Cork> Justice: both, defer="defer" is xhtml and ya, not needed
[11:08:14] <Levin^_> hm
[11:08:46] <Cork> also you can do it with scrollLeft too, but you will have to not use position()
[11:09:27] <Cork> as the position() changes all the time and things will break
[11:09:45] <Cork> anyway i'm afk
[11:11:23] <Levin^_> ok
[11:11:24] <Levin^_> thanks
[12:31:04] <Levin^_> hello
[12:31:13] <Levin^_> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zjRpJz?editors=0010
[12:32:44] <Levin^_> I made several tests on my code and I can't find an alternative to position() (example, check line 33)
[12:33:06] <Levin^_> every var targetItem1, 2, 3, etc have that command
[12:35:32] <Dro> Hello
[12:35:49] <Dro> how to do something like http://www.myurl.com/index.php?var=1
[12:35:55] <Dro> with ajax
[12:36:07] <Dro> how to pass the "var=1" in data?
[12:37:24] <Dro> thats ok, solved
[12:37:30] <Dro> I had a syntax error :P
[16:12:13] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:12:29] <taplar> aloha
[16:31:12] <Respect> Could someone help me with a simple jquery question, I'm a bit rusty. I've got this html (https://pastebin.com/J2AKLU4C), in the js file it's called question.itemBodyHtml. How might I add a tabindex='0' to all of the P tags in it?
[16:32:06] <Respect> I've tried various version of: question.ItemBodyHtml = $(question.ItemBodyHtml).find("p").replaceWith('<p tabinddex="0">');
[16:32:49] <taplar> one second.  how does this pastebin relate to your logic?
[16:33:31] <taplar> is this html a string stored in question.ItemBodyHtml?
[16:34:19] <Respect> That's correct. that's the html in question, though it will come in various structures.
[16:34:34] <taplar> alright, in that case you don't need to do the replace
[16:35:09] <taplar> question.ItemBodyHtml = $(question.ItemBodyHtml).find("p").attr('tab-index', 0).prop('outerHTML');
[16:35:17] <Respect> youmightnotneedjqueryreplace.com
[16:35:18] <taplar> err, crap
[16:35:27] <taplar> question.ItemBodyHtml = $(question.ItemBodyHtml).find("p").attr('tab-index', 0).end().prop('outerHTML');
[16:35:28] <Respect> would be a good website for me
[16:36:19] <taplar> first, parse the html with jQuery, then find all the p elements, then set the tab index on them, then call end() to return to the complete html structure that was parsed, and finally get the complete updated html
[16:36:36] <taplar> if tabindex doesn't have a dash, take it out.  i forget
[16:36:38] <Respect> so if I'm reading it right, it finds any P tags, sets the attribute of tabindex='0', but not sure about how the end or prop methods affect it
[16:36:44] <Respect> no dash, but that's ok
[16:37:08] <Respect> ah ok, thanks for explaining it step by step
[16:37:28] <Respect> and I didn't even have to hike up a mountain to a shrine to get your help :)
[16:37:35] <taplar> nah
[16:38:23] <taplar> so are you familiar with attr(), prop(), and outerHTML?
[16:38:29] <Respect> well much appreciated.
[16:38:49] <Respect> attr yes, but prop and outerHtml I haven't used as much if I recall
[16:39:13] <taplar> prop is similiar to attr, but it changes the properties on the dom element, which may not have associated attributes on the element
[16:39:23] <taplar> changes or fetches
[16:39:33] <taplar> depending on if you give it one or two arguments, just like attr()
[16:39:59] <taplar> so like, a dom element has properties like offset.top and stuff like that, right?
[16:40:15] <taplar> prop('offset').top could be used to access that off of a jQuery object
[16:40:27] <Respect> right. so if I wanted to build logic I could pass one argument, but if I wanted to change a property I would pass two
[16:40:36] <taplar> yep
[16:40:59] <taplar> then as far as outerHTML goes, outerHTML is the pairing with innerHTML.  the difference is outerHTML includes the html for the element you are calling it on
[16:41:16] <taplar> if you do element.innerHTML it returns just the html for the element's contents, not the element's html itself
[16:41:44] <Respect> so string manipulation essentially, of the element's content
[16:41:48] <Respect> ok that makes sense
[16:41:52] <Respect> thanks for the refresher
[16:42:01] <taplar> <div>weee</div> <--- innerHTML is just the weee
[16:42:06] <taplar> outerHTML is the whole thing
[16:42:21] <taplar> if the dom element you are calling it on is the div
[16:42:44] <Respect> so why does prop('outerHTML') come last? I guess that's not totally clear. wouldn't that come 1st?
[16:42:56] <taplar> because you want to get the results of your changes
[16:43:11] <Respect> right, you need to return html, not a jquery wrapped object
[16:43:11] <taplar> if you did it first, it would be a string, and then you couldn't do the jQuery methods on it
[16:43:22] <Respect> that didn't occur to me
[16:45:10] <Respect> in some questions it looks like the html is malformed. Would there be a way to change that method chain to only trigger if there's content inside of the p?
[16:45:45] <taplar> sure, you could write a filter method
[16:46:12] <taplar> .find('p').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.trim(); })
[16:46:31] <taplar> if the length of the innerHTML isn't 0, it will return the p element as part of the filter results
[16:47:35] <Respect> your encyclopedic recall of jquery is impressive. You've used it a lot I take it?
[16:47:47] <taplar> quite a bit
[16:48:07] <Respect> Could you advice someone like myself on how to be more efficient in looking up solutions from the docs? Sometimes they seem a bit opaque.
[16:48:31] <taplar> personally i would say just google stuff
[16:48:36] <Respect> For example, that last question was pretty straightforward, but upon looking there weren't any examples in the docs that seemed to apply
[16:48:45] <taplar> thing like "javascript, i want to ..." usually turns up some decent results
[16:49:07] <taplar> but it's also helpful if you can break down what you want to do into smaller pieces
[16:49:19] <Respect> ok, that's good advice thanks
[16:49:34] <Respect> also fundamental vocab probably helps
[16:49:46] <taplar> yeah so for this one there were sorta three questions
[16:49:47] <Respect> like: I want to filter out empty elements from my function
[16:49:55] <taplar> javascript, how do i parse html?
[16:50:04] <taplar> javascript, how do i set the tabindex on elements?
[16:50:06] <Respect> filter being the operative method for jquery, it would be a better start
[16:50:42] <Respect> more great advice :) Ok well thanks for imparting me with that
[16:51:18] <taplar> np.  and don't be afraid to pop in here and ask questions
[16:51:25] <taplar> there's usually some one around
[16:52:43] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:52:52] <taplar> bonjour
[16:53:13] <Respect> Sure, will do. I think the filter method you showed me kicked out all of the other content than the P tags unfortunately. Maybe I'll just write a short one to find any empty P tags and remove them from the question.itemHtml object
[16:54:11] <taplar> you mean you think the filter removed stuff other than p tags?
[16:54:38] <Respect> Yes, perhaps I implemented it improperly? $(question.ItemBodyHtml).find("p").filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.trim()}).attr('tabindex', 0).end().prop('outerHTML');
[16:55:21] <Respect> The template only consists of this now: <p tabindex="0">Consider this quadrilateral.<br><br> <img src="/content/unzip/files/3101777/images/mth-g-8-exer-4-3-figure.png" alt="Line l and a trapezoid with its base on line 1 and its parallel sides perpendicular to the line. The top of the trapezoid slants up from left to right." style="padding-left:10%;"></p>
[16:55:32] <taplar> no, that should only filter on the p tags, as that's the preceding operation.  At that point it's operating upon a jQuery object containing only p tags
[16:55:42] <taplar> ooh!
[16:55:43] <taplar> lol
[16:55:49] <taplar> you need to repeat the end()
[16:55:59] <taplar> the filter() caused another transition
[16:56:03] <Respect> ok, so don't chain it, just do it as a separate operation?
[16:56:05] <taplar> sorry about that
[16:56:20] <taplar> yeah, if you broke it up into steps you could do without the ends
[16:56:21] <Respect> no apologies necessary, learning a ton
[16:56:37] <naki444> I'm having trouble using ajax to show without refresh. Could I please get some help on this?
[16:57:00] <taplar> naki444: sure, share your logic and someone can help if they have a moment
[17:00:14] <uranium[oc]70> o.o
[17:01:48] <Respect> Hm I think I might have lost the thread somewhere in your explanation https://pastebin.com/W8aijUcr
[17:02:11] <Respect> that's the implementation I came up with, but it still turns the template into just a single P tag
[17:02:30] <Respect> I was just hoping to remove the empty P tags I found, but tbh that's just a nice to have :)
[17:04:28] <naki444> Ok here goes. I'm using Bootstrap tabs and php to pull in classes associated with the current session. This works fine however the only problem I am encountering is that when I submit a student to this class it doesn't show straight away unless I refresh the page OR switch between the Bootstrap tabs. When I register the student I want it to show up straight away in the current tab list of students for that specific class. I have a paste 
[17:05:06] <Respect> naki444: you can probably press up in the irc client you're using to copy the end of that message that got cut off
[17:05:44] <taplar> sorry guys, afk for some office stuff for a few moments
[17:05:52] <naki444> Nothing is cut off I don't think?
[17:07:19] <Respect> the paste did I thought, my mistake if not
[17:07:23] <Respect> taplar: no sweat
[17:09:45] <taplar> bak, lets see...
[17:10:28] <taplar> Respect: ok, for yours, what you want to do is set $(question.ItemBodyHtml) to a variable
[17:10:40] <taplar> don't overlay the original necessarily
[17:10:48] <taplar> make all your changes to that different element
[17:11:00] <taplar> and then at the end, set the original back to it's prop('outerHTML')
[17:11:00] <Respect> then set the original to that at the end, ok can do
[17:11:38] <Respect> can do: after all the filtering etc, just do original = whateverVar.prop('outerHTML').
[17:12:07] <taplar> yep, and all your operations to whateverVar would be just the operations.  you wouldn't do whateverVar = whatever.things()
[17:12:19] <taplar> since the operations will be updating the elements already
[17:18:07] <naki444> taplar: If it helps line 43 of students.php is the Ajax response. The $tab->id references the class id.
[17:18:50] <taplar> naki444: I haven't seen your paste yet.  Your comment said "I have a paste" and nothing after it on my end
[17:19:00] <naki444> Oh really?
[17:19:04] <naki444> https://paste.ee/p/WU1oT
[17:19:35] <naki444> That's odd it shows above the full sentence and now know why Respect had mentioned.
[17:19:49] <naki444> That's odd it shows above the full sentence and explains why Respect had mentioned.
[17:22:20] <taplar> I'm assuming from your description, that you are creating the new student, but you are not adding the new student to element that the tabs is built off of
[17:24:20] <naki444> The student should append to the end of the list in the current tab when registration is complete.
[17:24:20] <taplar> yeah I don't see where you are modifying the tab content or anything like that
[17:24:58] <taplar> all i see you doing on the success of the register is the modal hide and a reset
[17:25:23] <naki444> Yeah that's right. So would I need to call the function students()?
[17:26:04] <naki444> If I do that then there's no ID passed through.
[17:26:25] <naki444> If you like at students function it gets the id from attribute data-ajax.
[17:27:06] <taplar> ok, so here's the thing.  your retrieval of the students is based on the clicking of one of the nav-items
[17:27:13] <naki444> Correct
[17:27:18] <taplar> but for a new student you are not creating a new nav-item for them
[17:27:35] <taplar> afai can tell
[17:27:59] <naki444> No there's no nav-item being created.
[17:28:05] <taplar> then that is your starting point
[17:28:32] <naki444> The php is pulling these nav-items (classes) in from the database.
[17:28:43] <taplar> the php doesn't re-run on the page
[17:28:54] <taplar> i think you may be confused about that
[17:29:06] <naki444> What do you mean, sorry?
[17:29:49] <taplar> PHP is a server side language, which you may be familiar with.  When you generate html or any document with php, the entire document is created on the server before being sent to the user.  The browser does not execute any of the <?php ?> logic
[17:30:41] <taplar> So any interaction the page has with the server through ajax, nothing on the page will be modified unless your javascript is written to modify it
[17:31:16] <taplar> reloading the page does cause the results to show, because that is the browser requesting the page again from the server, and the server will re-run the script and return the newly generated page as a whole
[17:31:46] <naki444> Even if I don't refresh the page I can click between the tabs and it will show the new student.
[17:32:00] <Respect> taplar: once you and naki444 find a stopping point, I think I dropped the ball somewhere: https://pastebin.com/wvaYw7Bm
[17:32:01] <taplar> because you've already got the html on the page for those elements
[17:32:49] <taplar> Respect: don't re-set the questionMarkup variable.  just do your operations
[17:33:24] <naki444> What if I was to make the tabs being php on students.php an Ajax reuqest instead?
[17:34:53] <taplar> Respect: https://pastebin.com/rFV8caLB
[17:35:26] <taplar> naki444: you mean make students.php return the complete markup for the tabs?
[17:35:37] <naki444> Yeah using Ajax?
[17:36:19] <taplar> sure, you could do that.  then in the success of that ajax call you would replace the tabs on the page with the markup you got from the response.  depending on how bootstrap initializes its stuff, you may have to reinitialize the tabs, but sure, that's viable
[17:36:46] <naki444> Ok, thanks. Let have try and do that. Brb.
[17:36:55] <taplar> i'm fixing to head out of here for the day though guys.  i'll catch you guys later
[17:37:04] <taplar> Respect: did that paste make sense?
[17:37:10] <naki444> Cya taplar
[17:38:41] <taplar> crap, gotta jet.  later!
[17:40:22] <Respect> yes, thanks to you earlier explanations it does. We set the new object to be able to run methods on, then set the filtered/prop'd output using prop('outerHTML') so the end result is just html again. Yes?
