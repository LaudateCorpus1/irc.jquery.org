[03:27:10] <Cork> mindpattern: iframes (any frame) is a separate document
[03:27:25] <Cork> mindpattern: $() looks in the current page so it won't find anything in the iframe
[03:28:02] <Cork> what you instead need to do is $('iframe').contents().find('p').remove()
[03:30:11] <Cork> contents() grab the contentDocument from the iframe and wraps it in a new jquery object, from there you can search for thing inside the iframe; as long as it is loaded from the same domain as the main page
[03:30:34] <Cork> if the iframe is from a different domain, the browser will block you and you can't script it from the parent domain

[20:56:19] <martinmcc101[m]> hi - anyone done much work with jquery.validation & jquery.validation.unobtrusive &typescript?
[20:57:46] <martinmcc101[m]> I've got code I had done that hooks in with the validate events, and stops a 'ladda' loading button if the form is not valid. All works fine in js, butting hitting a wall with getting it working in typescript.
