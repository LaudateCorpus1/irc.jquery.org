[00:17:22] <Woet> Rockwood: ok, go ahead and change the code accordingly then.
[00:17:55] <Rockwood> Woet, problem solved
[00:18:03] <Woet> there was a problem?
[00:30:31] <Rockwood> is there some kind of a `refresh` function in JQuery?
[00:30:47] <Woet> Rockwood: refresh what?
[00:31:57] <Rockwood> page
[00:32:24] <ryan_ford> what are you trying to do? update a nodelist?
[00:32:35] <Robdgreat> or just reload the page
[00:32:35] <Woet> Rockwood: why do you need a jQuery function for something that basic JS offers?
[00:32:44] <Robdgreat> ryan_ford: don't overthink this
[00:32:48] <Woet> Rockwood: did you try googling "jquery refresh page"?
[00:36:39] <ryan_ford> ðŸ™Š
[00:46:46] <Rockwood> Woet, IS ANSWER OR SUGGESTION?
[00:46:58] <Woet> Rockwood: both.
[00:51:38] <konrados> Rockwood: if you *did* that, i.e. followed the suggestion, you would find the answer. Googling "jquery refresh page" gives e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5404839/how-can-i-refresh-a-page-with-jquery - that is, you don't need jquery to 'refresh a page'.
[00:53:49] <Rockwood> konrados, thanks for this
[00:54:18] <Rockwood> i already find out solution
[02:11:25] <RawJS> how hard would it be to reverse engineer this from jquery to javascript?
[02:11:26] <RawJS> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LBYVgd
[02:15:15] <Cork> RawJS: jquery is javascript so that is is kinda none question
[02:15:28] <Cork> but i guess you mean to convert it to not depending on jquery
[02:15:37] <RawJS> yea
[02:15:40] <RawJS> I think I got it
[02:15:43] <RawJS> however
[02:15:45] <RawJS> :D
[02:15:50] <Anamol>  how to send true value from promise function
[02:16:07] <Cork> RawJS: and the function is simple so it shouldn't be hard
[02:16:35] <Anamol>  how to send true value from promise function
[02:16:53] <Cork> Anamol: by returning true?
[02:17:03] <Cork> not sure what you're really asking
[02:17:26] <Cork> (would prob recommend to make a jsfiddle showing what you have problem with)
[02:18:37] <Anamol> http://jsfiddle.net/enq076vd/
[02:19:07] <Anamol> i want to return true from this function after certain timeout
[02:19:43] <Cork> Anamol: again, not sure what the problem is http://jsfiddle.net/enq076vd/2/
[02:21:50] <Anamol> http://jsfiddle.net/4fazxhvu/1/
[02:21:55] <Anamol> my page is not receiving timeouts
[02:21:59] <Anamol> Cork
[02:22:17] <Cork> shouldContentBeHidden() doesn't return a boolean it returns a promise
[02:22:52] <Anamol> so what i should return from mthere
[02:22:59] <Cork> nothing http://jsfiddle.net/4fazxhvu/2/
[02:22:59] <Anamol> return resolve v alue?
[02:23:11] <Cork> you can't use return value with promises
[02:23:22] <Cork> cause return is synchronous
[02:24:44] <Anamol> woah
[02:24:47] <Anamol> now i get it
[02:24:48] <Anamol> thankyou
[02:25:06] <Anamol> what about the return promise statement
[02:25:09] <Anamol> do i remove it?
[02:25:16] <Anamol> cause it doesnt work
[02:25:20] <Cork> no, you need to return the promise object
[02:25:26] <Cork> else you don't have anything to work on
[02:25:51] <RawJS> Cork yup, thanks I got it
[02:25:52] <RawJS> :)
[02:26:02] <RawJS> it was actually less lines of code
[02:26:05] <RawJS> easy pz
[02:26:16] <Cork> but the resolution of the promise is always a callback
[02:26:21] <Anamol> ohh i see
[02:27:21] * Cork really doesn't like web irc clients...
[02:32:51] <RawJS> Cork I have a regular client, but i'm on my windows side which i dont have a client here :(
[02:32:54] <RawJS> should just get it
[02:33:30] <Cork> RawJS: i don't fundamentally have a problem with the client, it is just how ppl that use them tend to expect irc to work like a search engine
[02:33:49] <Cork> like ask a question and leave 40 seconds later if noone has answered directly and things like that
[02:34:02] <RawJS> yea
[02:34:03] <RawJS> true

[04:13:16] <Anamol> how do i increase mydiv's height by the amount of pagescrolled  in y axis
[04:13:51] <ryan_ford> set the height to that value?

[04:18:40] <Anamol> im using this

[04:22:09] <Anamol> where are the helping hands
[04:25:04] <ryan_ford> if you have a question we can answer, but i don't think anyone is really interested in doing it for you
[04:25:10] <ryan_ford> you won't learn that way either
[04:30:21] <Anamol> i asked a question i think
[04:30:21] <Anamol> xD
[04:32:47] <AdamPDotty> no question mark recognized
[04:45:31] <Anamol> how do I get the length of scrolled amount?
[04:47:14] <Anamol> im using var topScroll  = document.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop ;
[04:47:22] <Anamol> but this returns 60 only instead of 60px
[04:51:53] <ryan_ford> so just append 'px' on the end
[04:54:30] <Anamol> but when i try to add it others it becomes 60pxandanothervalue
[04:54:35] <Anamol> it with others*
[04:54:57] <preference> append and then add px
[04:55:10] <preference> (60px+30) -> (60+30)px
[04:55:21] <preference> append or add, whatever
[04:55:32] <Anamol> ok let me try
[05:05:35] <pihpah> Is it true that jQuery is dying with the advent of ReactJs and Angular?
[05:06:43] <Anamol> its not working preference
[05:06:50] <Anamol> as one value is already px
[05:20:11] <ryan_ford> try parseInt
[08:36:41] <ponyrider> i am really confused as to how to use jquery to traverse html
[08:36:49] <ponyrider> so i have this >> http://termbin.com/psav
[08:37:08] <Cork> you never traverse html
[08:37:30] <Cork> jquery and browsers use dom and it is the dom you traverse
[08:37:30] <ponyrider> traverse the dom?
[08:37:34] <Cork> ya
[08:37:59] <Cork> jquery doesn't have any press event as far as i know
[08:38:12] <Cork> ah wait hammer...
[08:38:12] <ponyrider> ok. you see, i have multiple fb-buttons, and i just want to get the targets parent
[08:38:15] <ponyrider> uhuh
[08:38:35] <ponyrider> yep its hammer. so there is a jquery plugin i was looking at, but i dont really understand it
[08:38:41] <Cork> well would have to request you to make a jsfiddle then, cause that dead code looks correct
[08:39:24] <ponyrider> yes but its returning the hammer event (i think)
[08:39:41] <Cork> possibly, but i'm not going to sit and guess what it is you have there
[08:39:56] <Cork> make a jsfiddle with an example dom and a running example of the problem
[08:40:44] <ponyrider> Cork: is this something i need? http://hammerjs.github.io/jquery-plugin/
[08:41:03] <Cork> don't think so
[08:41:12] <Cork> it just exposes hammer on the jquery object
[08:41:28] <Cork> but i haven't used hammerjs so i'm only guessing
[10:01:33] <khobo> how come this doesn't work?
[10:01:33] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/2nx940th/1/
[10:01:41] <khobo> i'm trying to use the
[10:01:46] <khobo> http://jquery.eisbehr.de/lazy/
[10:02:25] <preference> firstly it's src=""
[10:02:36] <khobo> so that means it has to be a direct path?
[10:02:48] <khobo> i tried placing a direct path in my real html file
[10:02:53] <khobo> and it did the same thing wouldn't load any images
[10:03:12] <preference> https://jsfiddle.net/2nx940th/4/
[10:03:36] <khobo> yeah but it isnt lazy loading
[10:04:40] <preference> sec
[10:07:17] <preference> ya, it's not even outputting to console for me
[10:08:07] <preference> god, i hate working with most plugins
[10:08:09] <khobo> what r u thinking then?
[10:08:18] <khobo> me too! i rarely get them to work
[10:08:23] <khobo> thought it was just me being an idiot
[10:09:35] <preference> https://jsfiddle.net/2nx940th/13/
[10:09:36] <preference> there you go
[10:11:27] <khobo> *squints
[10:11:48] <preference> ya, apparently lazy uses data-src=""
[10:12:09] <preference> because src="" is used as a placeholder while the lazy loads
[10:13:07] <khobo> ooo
[10:13:16] <khobo> <picture><source media='(min-width: 1001px)'
[10:13:16] <khobo> srcset='content/editorial/001.jpg'/>
[10:13:27] <khobo> the list of images i want to lazy load are setup like that
[10:13:29] <khobo> with two alts
[10:13:33] <khobo> i bet this is going to fuck that right up
[10:13:45] <khobo> large version vs small for mobile
[10:16:15] <khobo> btw thanks preference
[10:16:17] <khobo> u never let me down

[11:20:42] <NL3limin4t0r> Is there an easy way to reload a jQuery selector? for example I have `$('#some-id')` stored a variable, later on I check if it exists and otherwise create the element. However the variable stays the same. I would like to call `myViarable.reload()` or something so that the varialble searches the DOM again for the provided query.
[11:21:15] <NL3limin4t0r> variable*
[11:59:08] <KnightsOfNi> my form keeps submitting twice... why?
[11:59:11] <KnightsOfNi> I press only once
[13:02:38] <khobo> ugh
[13:02:43] <khobo> can someone help me with this jquery plugin
[13:02:45] <khobo> its not wokring for me
[13:03:03] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/y9qxgkxc
[13:03:32] <taplar> we typically ask for issues to be provided in a jsfiddle or a jsbin
[13:03:55] <taplar> and more information.  like, what plugin?
[13:04:44] <khobo> it's this http://jquery.eisbehr.de/lazy/
[13:04:53] <khobo> the reason i haven't jsfiddled it
[13:04:56] <khobo> because of the calls are really long
[13:04:59] <khobo> on the picture elements
[13:05:08] <khobo> i can try but figured it'd just be easier to see it in real time?
[13:05:53] <taplar> perhaps for you.  you know your code.  where as anyone else has to dig and try to figure out what is going on.  vs a reduced example of the issue
[13:05:53] <khobo> i was getting help from a friend and he did this
[13:05:54] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/6/
[13:06:38] <khobo> im getting a 404 on the lazy.min.js tho
[13:06:42] <khobo> killing me slowly
[13:07:16] <taplar> it looks like that fiddle is already including the resources in the Resources on the left hand side, so you don't need them in the markup
[13:07:29] <khobo> when i don't include them in the markup
[13:07:31] <khobo> the images break for some reason
[13:07:41] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/13/
[13:07:44] <khobo> can we just use this?
[13:08:02] <khobo> fuck im still gettin ga 404
[13:08:16] <khobo> ugh i thought this was going to be simple to implement
[13:08:30] <khobo> the problem is i want to use <picture> element
[13:08:31] <taplar> one sec.  it's ok with the cloudfare ones, but not the others
[13:08:32] <khobo> instead of img src
[13:09:09] <khobo> they have a plugin for <picture> apparently at
[13:09:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/14/
[13:09:19] <khobo> https://github.com/eisbehr-/jquery.lazy/tree/master/plugins#picture-loader
[13:10:42] <khobo> okay problem one solved
[13:10:47] <khobo> thanks for your time by the way
[13:10:50] <khobo> i really really appreciate it
[13:11:04] <khobo> im a photographer not a coder
[13:11:13] <khobo> trying to learn what i need to make it happen
[13:11:16] <taplar> so you are saying the lazy load only works with the images, and not picture?
[13:11:24] <khobo> noo just the <picture>
[13:11:29] <khobo> if you look at my main site the tinyurl
[13:11:36] <khobo> you'll see all the photographs in a line running down the screen
[13:11:49] <khobo> i think this is an actual instance where a lazyload would be important
[13:12:19] <khobo> i just put the img tags in there to play around and make sure the JS was actually triggering
[13:12:40] <khobo> the <picture> elements srcset arent data-srcset
[13:12:46] <khobo> which i believe is required since it's creating a placeholder
[13:12:51] <khobo> but when i change it to data-srcset
[13:12:54] <khobo> it breaks and wont load any images
[13:14:39] <khobo> my friend added in that jquery code.. i have no idea what it does btw
[13:15:12] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/23/
[13:15:37] <khobo> effect: 'fadeIn',
[13:15:39] <khobo> where should that go?
[13:15:45] <khobo> that way we can actually see it trigger
[13:15:49] <khobo> it looks the same to me still
[13:16:14] <taplar> I'm not familiar with this plugin so I'm just tinkering.  In that last fiddle I shared, I removed the `http` from the picture urls and the images are loading now
[13:16:30] <khobo> weird, i've seen this before
[13:16:32] <khobo> why use //?
[13:16:36] <khobo> they were using it on hte script CDN
[13:16:42] <khobo> i've never seen that before
[13:16:55] <taplar> When you load a resource with `//url` it uses the protocol that the page loaded with
[13:17:06] <taplar> rather than hardcoding http or https
[13:17:07] <khobo> ohhhh
[13:17:22] <taplar> because if you hard code it and you can access the site from either http or https, you are going to be mixing protocols
[13:17:28] <khobo> ohhhhhh
[13:17:32] <khobo> he said something like that
[13:17:39] <khobo> had no idea what he was talking about
[13:17:47] <taplar> https doesn't like you trying to access http resources
[13:18:10] <khobo> actually he called it "cross origin bs"
[13:18:23] <khobo> im supposing he was referencing same issue
[13:18:33] <taplar> it can cause cross origin issues, yeah
[13:18:54] <khobo> http://jquery.eisbehr.de/lazy/#examples
[13:24:43] <khobo> this is way over my head
[13:24:45] <khobo> =/
[13:24:48] <khobo> any ideas?
[13:24:52] <khobo> maybea  simpler way to do this
[13:27:18] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/38/
[13:27:30] <taplar> i updated the fiddle to include the picture plugin for the plugin
[13:27:45] <taplar> and then they have some examples of it's usage
[13:27:45] <taplar> https://github.com/eisbehr-/jquery.lazy/tree/master/plugins#picture-loader
[13:28:14] <khobo> wait does this actually work?
[13:28:20] <khobo> what'd you change?
[13:28:46] <taplar> no it doesn't work.  i just put the plugin into it so you could play around with the examples their api is given in their github page
[13:29:00] <khobo> oh shit it was missing hte plugin!
[13:29:04] <khobo> ohh no
[13:29:09] <khobo> plugins.min.js
[13:29:12] <khobo> has picture.min.js in it
[13:29:44] <taplar> ah, nvm
[13:29:51] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/43/
[13:30:07] <khobo> according ot their code
[13:30:10] <taplar> so yeah, then you just need to look at their api with their examples
[13:30:12] <khobo> it should work without a JS entry
[13:30:17] <khobo> it should just use picture to call it
[13:31:01] <taplar> your logic has <source> tags though, where as theirs do not
[13:31:20] <khobo> you're right i just noticed this
[13:41:49] <taplar> yeah, so it looks like you configure it like they want, and their plugin will transform it to have the source elements once they are loaded
[13:43:49] <khobo> gross
[13:44:04] <khobo> the pictureloader looks like they're using retina alts
[13:44:09] <khobo> 2x 1x 3x
[13:44:20] <khobo> hmm
[13:44:44] <taplar> i'm not sure how to make it do the multiple media things though
[13:44:52] <khobo> yeah
[13:45:00] <khobo> somoene said i should just create a listern on scroll
[13:45:06] <khobo> and then dynamically load after it hits the end
[13:46:01] <taplar> so what issue are you trying to solve here?
[13:46:17] <taplar> are you trying to keep the page from jumping around, or just trying to ease up the loading until they are needed?
[13:47:21] <khobo> https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/lazyload/
[13:47:23] <khobo> maybe thsi would work
[13:47:33] <khobo> ease up the loading
[13:47:38] <khobo> until needed
[13:48:57] <taplar> you may have to write your own thing for that then
[13:49:17] <taplar> using a scroll listener like was suggested
[13:57:21] <taplar> playing around with it
[14:14:43] <taplar> khobo: may have something for you
[14:16:52] <taplar> khobo: https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/55/
[14:17:23] <khobo> whaaaat
[14:17:39] <khobo> is this custom?
[14:17:44] <taplar> i just wrote that
[14:17:53] <khobo> lets see if this badboy works
[14:18:04] <khobo> dude much much much thanks
[14:18:28] <taplar> i put comments in it so hopefully it's understandable.  but feel free to ask if anything is confusing
[14:28:46] <khobo> hmmmmm
[14:28:49] <khobo> i dont think it's triggering
[14:28:50] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/y9qxgkxc
[14:28:52] <khobo> that's the live version
[14:29:03] <khobo> i didnt set picture to absolute though
[14:29:21] <taplar> you don't have to do that
[14:29:29] <taplar> i was just doing that so the fiddle would scroll
[14:29:43] <taplar> you do have an error in one of your scripts though
[14:30:01] <khobo> line 81?
[14:30:16] <taplar> yah
[14:30:21] <khobo> yeah, i dunno what that's about
[14:30:29] <khobo> my friend who i was talking about earlier did that for me
[14:30:44] <taplar> also take note of how I have the markup for the pictures in that fiddle
[14:30:54] <khobo> all i noticed was picture got a class added to it
[14:30:57] <khobo> but let me relook
[14:31:10] <taplar> look at how the srcset and src are defined
[14:31:19] <taplar> and the associated data-srcset and data-src
[14:32:19] <khobo> brutal
[14:32:32] <khobo> one seccccc
[14:33:25] <taplar> you may can leave off the about blank part and just not set those attributes, but you definitely want to have the data attributes set rather than the normal ones, as if you set the normal ones it is going to try to load the images immediately
[14:34:21] <taplar> also as a heads up, some of the pictures on your page may be considered nsfw, so a heads up would be nice in the future
[14:39:02] <khobo> sorry about that
[14:39:07] <khobo> didn't think about it
[14:39:15] <khobo> so before any of the images load
[14:39:18] <khobo> i see a broken file icon
[14:39:49] <taplar> yep, since about blank isn't an image file
[14:40:04] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/y9qxgkxc
[14:40:25] <khobo> oh weird it actually doesn't work live at all
[14:40:29] <khobo> *bangs head
[14:40:55] <khobo> weird works on chrome
[14:40:57] <khobo> no dice on safari
[14:41:13] <khobo> also super choppy in how it loads too
[14:41:18] <khobo> maybe i'd be better just using a plugin
[14:42:27] <taplar> to get rid of the broken icon thing, you could set the default src/srcset to some small image that is transparent, or something
[14:42:57] <taplar> but yeah, all it's doing it delaying the load.  it's not considering anything else
[14:46:43] <khobo> oo that's a good idea
[14:46:45] <khobo> ill try that too
[14:46:53] <khobo> maybe this is a start someone can polish up easily
[14:50:58] <taplar> try this and see what you think
[14:51:04] <taplar> add this to your css rules
[14:51:08] <taplar> .lazy:not(.loaded) { visibility: none; }
[14:55:00] <taplar> that should keep the broken images from showing
[14:55:08] <khobo> no
[14:55:11] <khobo> didnt do it
[14:55:19] <khobo> good idea tho
[14:55:33] <khobo> i mean hte biggest problem right now
[14:55:35] <taplar> you put that on your hide5 page?
[14:55:36] <khobo> doesnt work on safari
[14:55:41] <khobo> no i tried it locally
[14:55:45] <khobo> i can update it tho
[14:56:16] <khobo> its there now
[14:56:44] <khobo> oh weird it does work on safari
[14:56:46] <khobo> just super delayed
[14:57:20] <khobo> got hung up pon chrome tho
[14:57:21] <taplar> weird, the visibility is being over ridden
[14:57:22] <khobo> and needed a refresh
[14:57:30] <khobo> i put it on the local styles
[14:57:34] <khobo> not in the css file
[14:57:48] <khobo> the clear transparency isnt rly an issue
[14:57:50] <taplar> oh, snap
[14:57:53] <khobo> would be easy to implement
[14:58:01] <taplar> change it from visibility: none to visibility: hidden
[14:58:13] <khobo> aha
[14:58:14] <khobo> one sec
[14:58:42] <khobo> boom
[14:59:04] <taplar> ok, so the broken image is gone for me now
[14:59:12] <khobo> it works
[14:59:15] <taplar> and safari is still not working?
[14:59:16] <khobo> but safari is super kinky
[14:59:23] <khobo> it loads the size of the images
[14:59:25] <khobo> without displaying hte images
[14:59:37] <khobo> and if i scroll around on it fo ra while
[14:59:40] <khobo> they start to display
[14:59:45] <taplar> werid
[14:59:49] <khobo> yeah its like a super long delay
[15:00:08] <taplar> see the part in the script that is doing < 100 ?
[15:00:16] <khobo> yup
[15:00:25] <khobo> 50?
[15:00:31] <taplar> try bumping that up to like 200 or 300 to increase how fast images load
[15:01:02] <khobo> okay reuploading
[15:01:18] <taplar> right now it's loading anything that is within 100 px of being in the screen.  if we increase that value more pictures lower on the page will load faster before getting to the viewport
[15:02:10] <khobo> weird
[15:02:16] <khobo> it does work better but not by much
[15:02:19] <khobo> the first image is loaded instantly
[15:02:25] <khobo> bottom stuff is still doing this funky biz
[15:02:31] <khobo> it's like a transparent placeholder is up
[15:02:49] <khobo> maybe like 600?
[15:02:52] <khobo> i tried 250 originally
[15:03:18] <taplar> i'm not sure.  i just refreshed and the top images are not displaying for me
[15:03:28] <taplar> i wonder if this is some weirdness with picture elements
[15:03:28] <khobo> oh safari?
[15:03:32] <taplar> in chrome
[15:03:48] <khobo> weird cause the top one displays for me but everything on the bottom is jacked
[15:03:50] <taplar> just refreshed and the top pic showed.  so it's inconsistent
[15:04:20] <khobo> yeah
[15:04:25] <khobo> it's like it doesnt know where it's at
[15:04:40] <taplar> i wonder if we can do something about that
[15:08:24] <khobo> this is literally like the last thing i want to implement
[15:08:29] <khobo> thought it was going to be a breeze
[15:08:33] <khobo> rarely is huh
[15:10:16] <taplar> try this modified version.  https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/58/
[15:15:55] <khobo> just the JS changed right?
[15:16:05] <taplar> right
[15:16:42] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/y9qxgkxc
[15:16:54] <taplar> i put an onload on the child elements and made them trigger a custom event on the picture, which will then try to replace itself in the page with itself.  hopefully causing the page to redraw it correctly
[15:17:05] <khobo> nope =/
[15:17:27] <khobo> inconsistent again
[15:17:46] <taplar> it looks like it is working for me in chrome.  bad in safari?
[15:19:58] <khobo> when i go to it
[15:19:59] <khobo> first time
[15:20:01] <khobo> only loads first image
[15:20:03] <khobo> if i hit reload
[15:20:06] <khobo> it will work
[15:20:18] <taplar> hmm
[15:20:27] <khobo> safari is just a no go
[15:20:30] <khobo> all blank
[15:20:33] <khobo> but able to scroll
[15:20:38] <khobo> images just arent showing up
[15:23:46] <taplar> next attempt: https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/60/
[15:24:21] <taplar> ln 28-32 changed
[15:25:42] <khobo> sorry was putting food in the oven
[15:25:45] <khobo> let me tryyyy
[15:25:51] <taplar> np
[15:26:01] <taplar> if this doesn't work, i have one more idea
[15:26:39] <khobo> yeah samesame on safari
[15:27:01] <khobo> chrome lokos better
[15:27:03] <khobo> but hangs up on reload
[15:27:04] <taplar> on safari, can you right click on the element to inspect it?
[15:27:10] <khobo> safari doesnt have inspect
[15:27:15] <taplar> grrr
[15:27:15] <khobo> dev tools
[15:27:21] <khobo> let me look tho
[15:27:36] <taplar> take off the css rule we put in there, and see if they start showing up in safari
[15:27:44] <khobo> yeah
[15:28:01] <taplar> they do?
[15:28:24] <khobo> okay weird
[15:28:26] <khobo> i didnt change the css
[15:28:28] <khobo> but
[15:28:29] <khobo> safari
[15:28:31] <khobo> here's what's going on
[15:28:42] <khobo> its giving a height out
[15:28:46] <khobo> on the image
[15:28:48] <khobo> right?
[15:28:51] <khobo> and the delay is super long
[15:28:56] <khobo> no image appears
[15:29:02] <khobo> but the point where it triggers the display
[15:29:04] <khobo> isnt at the top of the image
[15:29:07] <khobo> you have to scroll way past it
[15:29:09] <khobo> to get it to trigger
[15:29:20] <khobo> something to do with the height sizing
[15:29:30] <khobo> the first one appears
[15:29:33] <taplar> hmm
[15:29:33] <khobo> but the second one is blank
[15:29:36] <khobo> and the rest are blank
[15:29:38] <khobo> BUT
[15:29:42] <khobo> it allows you to scroll down
[15:29:47] <khobo> its just blank
[15:30:00] <khobo> until you get like midpoint of where the image should be
[15:30:22] <khobo> chrome works like it should
[15:30:25] <khobo> except when you click refresh
[15:30:27] <khobo> it hangs on the first one
[15:30:29] <khobo> and wont display the rest
[15:30:31] <khobo> until you refresh again
[15:30:33] <khobo> super weird
[15:31:21] <taplar> ./hide5 is working for me in chrome when i refresh, so i'm not seeing what you're seeing there
[15:31:33] <taplar> but let me try one more thing
[15:32:31] <khobo> weird
[15:33:00] <khobo> https://imgur.com/a/M8hjxWv
[15:33:03] <khobo> that's what happens on refresh
[15:33:55] <taplar> are you going to be using this with images, or just pictures?
[15:34:26] <khobo> what do you mean
[15:34:34] <khobo> just photographs
[15:34:49] <khobo> if thats waht you mean
[15:34:57] <taplar> right now the script is trying to check for <img> and <picture>.  if you are only going to use <picture> i could rip out the img logic
[15:35:08] <khobo> i've just had a couple of industry people tell me it loads too slowly
[15:35:11] <khobo> and will turn editors off
[15:35:21] <khobo> so im trying to cut down on loading time while still giving ability to load on larger desktops
[15:35:45] <khobo> so i think what's important is having two images one mobile one desktop sizing
[15:35:49] <khobo> that loads depending on viewport
[15:36:45] <taplar> but about the <img>, yes/no ?
[15:37:00] <khobo> *squints
[15:37:13] <khobo> doesnt it have to be picture element?
[15:37:20] <khobo> to get the alt image loads dpending on viewport?
[15:37:32] <taplar> the picture has a sub img, but there are no stand alone img tags on your page, afaik
[15:37:50] <khobo> i mean the way it is now
[15:37:52] <taplar> in regards to what you are lazy loading
[15:37:56] <khobo> is what ill be loading
[15:37:57] <khobo> only
[15:38:01] <taplar> k
[15:38:05] <khobo> sorry man just wasnt clear
[15:38:09] <khobo> on understanding
[15:38:25] <taplar> np, just making sure i could rip some of this out if it will not be used
[15:39:33] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/61/
[15:39:41] <taplar> ok, i changed the script, and the css rule is different
[15:41:28] <khobo> okay let me plug it in!!
[15:42:33] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/y9qxgkxc
[15:42:35] <khobo> hmm super weird
[15:42:58] <khobo> looks like some kinda transition effect
[15:43:00] <khobo> also gets hung up too
[15:43:01] <taplar> wtf
[15:43:01] <khobo> =//
[15:43:13] <taplar> lol
[15:43:30] <robertmaxrees> so there's a perf issue?
[15:43:36] <khobo> perf?
[15:43:43] <robertmaxrees> performance
[15:43:44] <taplar> performance
[15:43:46] <khobo> oh
[15:43:58] <taplar> i have no idea why it's doing that shrinking effect...
[15:44:03] <khobo> lol
[15:44:27] <taplar> but!
[15:44:31] <taplar> do they show on safari?
[15:44:45] <khobo> yeah
[15:44:48] <taplar> lmao
[15:44:50] <khobo> but still doing the height thing
[15:45:05] <taplar> wait, so still invisible?
[15:45:10] <khobo> it is until i scroll down
[15:45:12] <khobo> and the it gets filled in
[15:45:18] <taplar> ah
[15:45:26] <khobo> but the height with no image is still there
[15:45:30] <taplar> so it's now filling in, where as it was not
[15:45:32] <khobo> yeah
[15:45:45] <khobo> the shrinking thing is weirddd
[15:45:49] <taplar> very
[15:46:54] <taplar> i may have an idea about that
[15:47:18] <taplar> i wonder if the scroll event is being triggered by the image showing some how
[15:47:23] <taplar> i wouldn't think so though
[15:48:15] <taplar> though it's not doing that on the fiddle...
[15:48:22] <khobo> wompwomp
[15:48:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/a0vy251b/62/
[15:48:41] <khobo> its not even lazy loading for me on jsfiddle
[15:48:49] <khobo> wait there it goes
[15:48:51] <khobo> i had to refresh!
[15:48:51] <khobo> lol
[15:49:13] <khobo> mannnnnnnn
[15:49:23] <khobo> where are you from btw?
[15:49:24] <taplar> you see it on the fiddle?
[15:49:27] <khobo> yeah i do
[15:49:30] <khobo> you're right
[15:49:34] <khobo> no weird transitions
[15:49:44] <taplar> usa
[15:50:06] <khobo> what part? me too =p
[15:50:28] <taplar> arkansas
[15:50:30] <khobo> whaaa
[15:50:39] <khobo> are you a developer?
[15:50:44] <taplar> yep
[15:50:47] <khobo> figuring you were in cali or something
[15:50:50] <khobo> r you from teh area originally?
[15:51:10] <taplar> state wise, yeah, but i've moved around the state a little
[15:51:41] <taplar> heh, you know developers exist outside cali, right? ^_~
[15:52:00] <khobo> lol
[15:52:01] <khobo> yes
[15:52:10] <khobo> that's cool
[15:52:15] <khobo> i grew up in the south
[15:52:20] <khobo> but never been to arkansas
[15:54:28] <taplar> can you make that change to the /hide5?  it looks like it has the old version of the script
[15:54:55] <khobo> hmm weird i thought i uploaded it
[15:54:56] <khobo> one sec
[15:54:59] <khobo> 62 right?
[15:55:14] <taplar> yes
[15:55:30] <khobo> uploaded
[15:55:46] <khobo> by golly
[15:55:48] <khobo> no transition
[15:56:07] <khobo> safari is still f'd tho
[15:56:23] <taplar> first picture isn't showing up for me in chrome now, though the transition is gone
[15:56:26] <khobo> lol
[15:56:27] <khobo> weird!!
[15:56:29] <khobo> it shows up for me
[15:56:41] <taplar> ok, it did now
[15:56:55] <taplar> idk man, lol
[15:57:06] <khobo> https://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/index.html
[15:57:10] <khobo> chk this one out
[15:57:23] <khobo> theres a picture element function
[15:57:28] <khobo> that works with the alt loads i believe
[15:57:58] <taplar> give it a shot
[15:58:08] <khobo> i really appreciate it, seriously
[15:58:40] <taplar> no worries.  i had some down time and this was interesting
[15:58:58] <taplar> though i wish i had a device with safari to play around with
[15:59:16] <khobo> it's like it's loading the picture box
[15:59:19] <khobo> but not the image
[15:59:33] <khobo> the dimensions remain but the picture doesnt display
[16:01:23] <taplar> yeah, definitely play around with the plugin you just found and see if it works.  if they've did any sort of device testing, it will be way more than we have done here so far, ^_^
[16:11:35] <khobo> i swear i basically copied everything over directly
[16:11:36] <khobo>  https://tinyurl.com/y9qxgkxc
[16:16:25] <taplar> started working after i reloaded a few times
[16:16:36] <khobo> https://iamsteve.me/blog/entry/nice-and-easy-lazy-loading-with-lazysizes-js
[16:27:33] <robertmaxrees> you realize there's a JS error on your page, right?
[16:42:58] <khobo> robertmaxrees:
[16:43:00] <khobo> how do i fix it?
[16:45:53] <robertmaxrees> do you see the error?
[16:46:12] <khobo> yeah
[16:46:19] <khobo> modalImage.onclick = right;
[16:46:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:46:23] <khobo> cannot set property to null
[16:46:28] <khobo> but i didnt write this a friend did =/
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> *of null
[16:46:32] <khobo> and he isnt on right now
[16:46:43] <robertmaxrees> who is "he"?
[16:46:43] <khobo> do you think that's what's giving us problems with this stupid lazy loading?
[16:46:55] <robertmaxrees> i would assume it's not helping.
[16:47:00] <khobo> a bud over in another channel
[16:47:11] <robertmaxrees> so
[16:47:20] <robertmaxrees> the message is pretty straightforward.
[16:47:23] <robertmaxrees> what does that suggest to do?
[16:47:54] <khobo> it sounds like i need to define
[16:48:02] <robertmaxrees> or
[16:48:07] <robertmaxrees> not assign if it's not assigned.
[16:48:17] <robertmaxrees> ie - modalImage may or may not exist.
[16:48:24] <robertmaxrees> so you should check if it does before trying to use it.
[16:48:29] <khobo> modalimage definitely exists
[16:48:41] <khobo> const modalImage = document.getElementById('modal-image');
[16:49:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:49:05] <robertmaxrees> except
[16:49:18] <robertmaxrees> go to your console and do document.getElementById('modal-image');
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[16:49:48] <khobo> sorry man, i dont know how to do that
[16:49:58] <khobo> im under console
[16:49:59] <robertmaxrees> your developer tools?
[16:50:01] <khobo> yeah
[16:50:02] <robertmaxrees> where you see that error?
[16:50:06] <khobo> console
[16:50:10] <robertmaxrees> see where you can enter text in the console?
[16:50:12] <khobo> says "uncaught typeerrror
[16:50:25] <khobo> i see a box that says filter in it
[16:50:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, below that there should be a spot where you can put code.
[16:50:41] <khobo> nadda
[16:50:48] <khobo> wait
[16:50:52] <khobo> > prompt?
[16:50:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:51:08] <khobo> okay okay
[16:51:11] <khobo> yeah, says null
[16:51:18] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[16:51:27] <robertmaxrees> so const foo = document.getElementById('modal-image'); means foo is...
[16:51:52] <khobo> undefined
[16:51:53] <khobo> ?
[16:52:12] <robertmaxrees> if document.getElementById('modal-image'); is null
[16:52:17] <robertmaxrees> and you say foo = document.getElementById('modal-image');
[16:52:34] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty straightforward :)
[16:52:56] <khobo> *sigh
[16:53:00] <khobo> should i just delete the line?
[16:53:07] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:53:15] <robertmaxrees> not if you need it there.
[16:53:40] <robertmaxrees> you could check if the var isn' exists before trying to use it though.
[16:53:52] <robertmaxrees> *isn't null or undefined before trying to use it, I mean
[16:54:57] <khobo> i feel like this is just a naming issue
[16:55:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:55:04] <khobo> i see image-modal
[16:55:05] <khobo> modal-image
[16:55:12] <khobo> modalImage
[16:55:13] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) maybe it is then.
[16:55:26] <robertmaxrees> i can't figure that out for you though.
[16:55:44] <khobo> sure, thanks for telling me how to input code
[16:55:54] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:18:33] <robertmaxrees> khobo you realize modalImage is null because document.getElementById('modal-image'); is null. right?
[17:18:39] <robertmaxrees> which means there's no element with that ID.
[17:19:16] <khobo> well to me that sounds like it's useless
[17:19:19] <khobo> so i try taking it out
[17:19:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:19:25] <khobo> and it breaks the functionality of what it does
[17:19:32] <robertmaxrees> i already told you what the fix is though.
[17:19:39] <khobo> let me reread
[17:19:43] <khobo> man im really a dummy with this stuff
[17:19:46] <khobo> JS is way over my head
[17:19:55] <khobo> im doing good knowing how to setup flexbox
[17:20:07] <robertmaxrees> that's why we're helping you learn :)
[17:20:21] <khobo> i would give anything to learn JS
[17:20:24] <khobo> i'd feel so free
[17:20:26] <khobo> i just havent put the time in
[17:20:30] <robertmaxrees> you're learning it right now.
[17:20:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:20:33] <khobo> sort of
[17:20:49] <khobo> one second though let me reread
[17:21:45] <khobo>  foo = document.getElementById('modal-image');
[17:21:46] <khobo> VM72:1 Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
[17:21:46] <khobo>     at <anonymous>:1:6
[17:22:00] <robertmaxrees> so multiline pastes in the channel are a no-no.
[17:22:07] <robertmaxrees> and that's not what I was suggesting.
[17:22:14] <khobo> sry
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> remember when I mentioned that bit about the var existing before using it?
[17:23:37] <khobo> *squints
[17:23:43] <khobo> sort of
[17:23:54] <khobo> i thought you had to define the var before using it though?
[17:24:01] <robertmaxrees> you could check if the var isn' exists before trying to use it though.
[17:24:05] <robertmaxrees> *isn't null or undefined before trying to use it, I mean
[17:24:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[17:26:41] <robertmaxrees> did I lose you again?
[17:27:02] <khobo> yeah man
[17:27:05] <taplar> whop whop whop
[17:27:47] <khobo> =right()?
[17:27:49] <khobo> instead of right
[17:27:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:27:56] <khobo> lol
[17:28:00] <khobo> im just guessing man!
[17:28:02] <khobo> i dont knowwww
[17:28:11] <robertmaxrees> the error is that you can't set onclick of null or undefined, right?
[17:28:11] <khobo> it's not defined
[17:28:16] <khobo> yes
[17:28:21] <robertmaxrees> WHAT is?
[17:28:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:28:29] <khobo> modalImage
[17:28:35] <robertmaxrees> right
[17:28:40] <khobo> but it looks defined to me!!!!
[17:28:45] <robertmaxrees> but it's not.
[17:28:46] <khobo> const modalImage = document.getElementById('modal-image');
[17:28:50] <robertmaxrees> because it's set to null or undefined.
[17:28:55] <khobo> that's defined right?
[17:28:59] <taplar> no
[17:29:03] <khobo> that's initiated
[17:29:05] <khobo> right?
[17:29:09] <robertmaxrees> that document.getElementById is returning null/undefined.
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> (probably null.
[17:29:26] <taplar> you're trying to find an element on the page, that does not exist
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:29:38] <robertmaxrees> so the function returns null
[17:30:20] <khobo> maybe it should be image.onclick=right?
[17:30:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:30:39] <khobo> i mean if i dont know JS logic
[17:30:42] <khobo> im never going to get this
[17:30:43] <robertmaxrees> you want to check if modalImage isn't null or undefined before you use it.
[17:30:53] <khobo> wait
[17:30:55] <khobo> like me personally
[17:30:58] <khobo> or the logic in the code
[17:31:02] <robertmaxrees> (so then you ask "how do I check if modalImage isn't null or undefined before I use it?"
[17:31:03] <robertmaxrees> )
[17:31:12] <khobo> and that's where foo comes in?
[17:31:16] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:31:21] <robertmaxrees> that was an example
[17:31:24] <robertmaxrees> ignore that for a minute.
[17:31:30] <robertmaxrees> focus on what I'm saying right now.
[17:32:06] <robertmaxrees> so
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> the easy way to check is a conditional.
[17:32:30] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/19ca5eca9d70
[17:32:36] <robertmaxrees> this might be one way you handle this case.
[17:33:13] <khobo> right
[17:33:15] <khobo> but all this does is
[17:33:18] <khobo> if you click the image
[17:33:21] <khobo> it advances to the next image
[17:33:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:33:30] <robertmaxrees> it gets rid of the error.
[17:33:30] <khobo> modalImage.onclick = right;
[17:33:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:33:45] <khobo> so if that's undefined
[17:33:47] <robertmaxrees> but if modalImage doesn't exist, then that throws an error.
[17:33:50] <khobo> right
[17:33:58] <khobo> so why is it linking to something that doesnt exist
[17:33:58] <robertmaxrees> so you don't run that if modalImage isn't defiuned.
[17:34:13] <khobo> shouldn't it be image.onclick=right'
[17:34:14] <robertmaxrees> because that document.getElementById call is returning undefined.
[17:34:15] <khobo> that makes sense to me
[17:34:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:34:33] <taplar> whatever logic you think is happening when you click whatever element, isn't coming from that logic
[17:34:57] <taplar> because the fact that it is undefined and throwing the error, means it is not attaching that click handler to it, in that code block
[17:35:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:35:35] <taplar> something some where else may be attaching it successfully, but that code block is not
[17:35:36] <khobo> im going line by line right now
[17:35:42] <khobo> one second
[17:36:34] <khobo> i get everything (i think)
[17:36:35] <robertmaxrees> i feel like I'm saying words but they are being ignored.
[17:36:43] <khobo> im definitely not ignoring you
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:36:48] <khobo> im just not understanding you
[17:36:57] <robertmaxrees> so clarify what you aren't understanding
[17:37:44] <khobo> why can't you just delete it
[17:37:50] <robertmaxrees> delete what?
[17:37:52] <khobo> what's modalImage.onclick=right; actually doing
[17:38:08] <robertmaxrees> it's binding a click handler to modalImage to fire a function called right
[17:38:14] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need that to happen any more, then delete it.
[17:38:18] <khobo> no i do
[17:38:20] <khobo> when i delete it
[17:38:22] <khobo> it stops advancing
[17:38:27] <khobo> its an image gallery
[17:38:30] <robertmaxrees> then don't delete it.
[17:38:39] <khobo> so bscailly its saying image.onclick opens up a block
[17:38:45] <khobo> then there's the logic for advancement
[17:38:52] <khobo> not sure what const keyhandler = e => does
[17:38:53] <khobo> what's e?
[17:38:57] <robertmaxrees> event.
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> usually.
[17:39:08] <khobo> e.keyCode e.which
[17:39:11] <khobo> never seen that before
[17:39:15] <khobo> switch (key) never seen
[17:39:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:39:31] <robertmaxrees> did you need us to help explain?
[17:39:39] <khobo> do or did
[17:39:45] <robertmaxrees> did
[17:39:49] <robertmaxrees> do
[17:39:49] <robertmaxrees> either
[17:39:52] <robertmaxrees> you know what I mean.
[17:40:12] <khobo> yeah sure i mean if you don tmind running through it that would be helpful
[17:40:21] <robertmaxrees> so you're stuck on what now?
[17:40:23] <robertmaxrees> keyHandler?
[17:40:28] <khobo> yeah
[17:40:34] <robertmaxrees> that's a function.
[17:40:39] <robertmaxrees> e is the event object.
[17:40:45] <khobo> for left arrow and right arrow keys?
[17:40:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to look up the keycodes.
[17:41:05] <khobo> pretty sure that's what it is
[17:41:08] <robertmaxrees> all I know is it's being used on keydown
[17:41:11] <khobo> so each key on your board
[17:41:14] <khobo> has a keycode?
[17:41:19] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:41:29] <khobo> gotcha
[17:41:37] <khobo> well it functions totally properly so im guessing 37 s left
[17:41:39] <khobo> 39 is right
[17:41:42] <khobo> okay cool
[17:41:46] <robertmaxrees> const key = e.keyCode || e.which; is grabbing that keycode.  some browsers can be different about how they store that on the event object.
[17:42:17] <robertmaxrees> so that's saying "set key to e.keyCode.  If that doesn't exist, set it to e.which"
[17:42:22] <khobo> gotcha
[17:42:57] <khobo> its weird that he defines leftArrow as 'left-arrow'
[17:43:08] <khobo> but i dont see it anywhere else in the code
[17:43:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:43:19] <robertmaxrees> you mean const leftArrow = document.getElementById('left-arrow'); ?
[17:43:22] <robertmaxrees> the id name?
[17:43:27] <khobo> yeah
[17:43:30] <khobo> so that's not defining it
[17:43:31] <khobo> what do you call it
[17:43:33] <khobo> initializing?
[17:43:34] <robertmaxrees> that's actually very common.
[17:43:54] <robertmaxrees> html often uses different conventions for naming things than, say, javascript.
[17:44:09] <taplar> document.getElementById('left-arrow') is looking for some html element in the body of the page that has an id="left-arrow"
[17:44:13] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:44:28] <robertmaxrees> any time you see foo = bar();, that's setting foo to the /return/ of bar()
[17:44:32] <robertmaxrees> bar() can return anything.
[17:44:33] <taplar> that line is not creating it.  it's getting a reference to it
[17:44:37] <robertmaxrees> including null and undefined.
[17:45:12] <khobo> weird
[17:45:17] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:45:17] <khobo> i dont see anything else
[17:45:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:45:21] <khobo> referencing that
[17:45:30] <taplar> what do you mean "that"?
[17:45:43] <khobo> like it's looking for html element with left-arrow
[17:45:44] <khobo> right?
[17:45:48] <khobo> nothing like that exists in any of the other code
[17:45:54] <taplar> i doesn't need to
[17:46:03] <taplar> leftArrow has a reference to it now
[17:46:09] <khobo> then why even have it?
[17:46:11] <taplar> it doesn't need to look it up over and over
[17:46:33] <taplar> if nothing else in the code uses leftArrow, then yeah, that would be a pointless lookup
[17:48:10] <khobo> maybe he got this from code scraps
[17:48:12] <khobo> and just left that stuff in
[17:54:17] <khobo> robertmaxrees:
[17:54:19] <khobo> your fix worked
[17:54:22] <khobo> but i dont get why
[17:54:26] <khobo> or if it was null in the first place
[17:54:30] <khobo> why it even did the click action
[17:54:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:54:58] <robertmaxrees> do you have different page tempaltes?
[17:55:07] <robertmaxrees> some with carousels and some without?
[17:55:12] <robertmaxrees> *templates
[18:01:36] <khobo> weird!
[18:01:39] <khobo> i added in that conditional
[18:01:41] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:01:43] <khobo> now it's erroring me out another line
[18:01:44] <khobo> lol
[18:01:44] <khobo> document.getElementById("close-button").onclick = function () {
[18:01:49] <khobo> same error
[18:01:55] <robertmaxrees> and so what do you do there?
[18:02:11] <khobo> same dealies
[18:03:13] <khobo> let me show you the site though
[18:03:24] <khobo> i somehow feel like im just making a bigger mess
[18:03:34] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/yd6x3377
[18:03:38] <khobo> maybe NSFW?
[18:03:41] <khobo> not really but yeah maybe
[18:03:54] <robertmaxrees> what is it?
[18:03:59] <khobo> my photo portfolio
[18:04:09] <robertmaxrees> maybe link to a non-nsfw page?
[18:04:18] <robertmaxrees> oh the homepage?
[18:04:24] <khobo> yeah
[18:04:28] <khobo> i mean worst pic when you scroll down
[18:04:32] <khobo> there's a butt
[18:04:53] <khobo> not xxx by any means
[18:04:55] <khobo> just weird
[18:04:56] <robertmaxrees> how are you making is a bigger mess?
[18:05:07] <robertmaxrees> you're stopping errors.
[18:05:10] <robertmaxrees> that's... apart of coding.
[18:05:15] <khobo> how come it didnt find that error
[18:05:19] <khobo> before i added the conditional in?
[18:05:28] <robertmaxrees> the other conditional you mean?
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> becauyse the JS stopped executing at the first error.
[18:05:50] <robertmaxrees> it didn't know how to proceed.
[18:05:51] <khobo> oh wow
[18:05:56] <robertmaxrees> so it just kind of gives up.
[18:05:59] <khobo> so weird all of this works
[18:06:18] <khobo> wait wait wait hold on let me reupload the new js file
[18:06:27] <khobo> i just fixed my favicon error =p
[18:07:11] <khobo> ohhhh
[18:07:12] <khobo> wait
[18:07:21] <khobo> the reason why this isnt working
[18:07:29] <khobo> because im clicking inspect
[18:07:30] <khobo> on the homepage
[18:07:46] <khobo> and yes there's no close-button ID
[18:07:48] <khobo> on the homepage..
[18:07:58] <khobo> but when i click on the part of the website where it uses these things
[18:07:59] <khobo> no error
[18:08:04] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:08:04] <khobo> so that's why i need the conditionals
[18:08:10] <robertmaxrees> bingo
[18:08:13] <khobo> fuckkk
[18:08:32] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:08:43] <khobo> makes sense now
[18:08:43] <khobo> okay
[18:08:57] <khobo> nowwww
[18:11:17] <khobo> figuring out how to do the conditional on the new one now
[18:12:17] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/vp7hfq2c/
[18:12:54] <khobo> did not work
[18:12:54] <khobo> =p
[18:13:06] <taplar> no, strings are always truthy
[18:14:07] <taplar> another way you can go about it, without doing a conditional, is to create a dummy element if the element you are trying to find does not exist.
[18:14:50] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/vp7hfq2c/2/
[18:14:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vp7hfq2c/3/
[18:15:29] <taplar> then if it doesn't exist, you'll out the onclick on the dummy element you created.  it will not do anything since that element is not on the page, but you will not get the error
[18:15:39] <khobo> for the win
[18:15:59] <khobo> jesus
[18:16:11] <khobo> i just have to go back to reading
[18:16:13] <khobo> and starting with helloworld
[18:16:20] <khobo> this was way beyond my abilities
[18:17:19] <taplar> just take it slow.  it's easy to get overwhelmed if you try to take it all in one go
[18:23:06] <khobo> thank you guys by the way!!
[18:30:45] <robertBusy> s'what we're here for.
[19:50:07] <forgotmynick> somethings wrong with a local application im using. when i double click, the browsers cpu usage goes to 100% and the tab is not responsive.  i've tried looking for event listeners but i'm turning up nothing. can anyone give me some guidance on how i can debug this?
[19:52:55] <ryan_ford> use `debugger;` and step through whatever actions are triggering on click
[19:53:25] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/javascript/statements/debugger
[21:02:09] <JohnDoe2> I'm reading up on a few things here but it just doesn't make sense. It might be the autosize plugin or not, but here's my issue: I can run autosize($('textarea')); from the console, but when inside document ready it says TypeError: $(...).autosize is not a function. I don't understand what is causing that error. $(...) is already used in the same block of document.ready.
[21:04:13] <JohnDoe2> seems like a caching issue, my bad. Stubborn FF...
