[00:00:02] <rhizmoe> which would be: var foo = $.parseJSON(bar); // ?
[00:00:09] <niftylettuce> anyone take a peak at my audio issue?
[00:00:23] <ajpiano> ?eval var str = '{"wat": "no u"}';  $.extend({hello: "there"}, JSON.parse(str));
[00:00:23] <bot-t> ajpiano: {"hello": "there", "wat": "no u"}
[00:00:27] <ajpiano> rhizmoe: yes
[00:00:31] <ajpiano> or JSON.parse
[00:00:33] <SPYGAME> ajpiano: any ideas how to make it work?

[00:01:06] <rhizmoe> ajpiano: thanks
[00:01:17] <ajpiano> SPYGAME: you can use like YAHOO pipes to proxy the thing and actually return JSONP
[00:01:22] <ajpiano> or make your service return JSONP
[00:01:31] <ajpiano> no matter what you're probably gonna be doing JSONP
[00:01:40] <ajpiano> so my number one advice would be to go learn about how that work
[00:01:40] <ajpiano> s
[00:01:52] <SPYGAME> ajpiano: what if i don't want to return any thing and just make a post request?
[00:02:01] <ajpiano> you can't post to another domain.
[00:02:04] <ajpiano> end of story
[00:02:06] <User99> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/LmFQF/2/ <-- why is my version so ugly when yours and mine dont have css?
[00:02:19] <ajpiano> User99: cause... mine has CSS linked in the resources pane
[00:02:50] <ajpiano> on the left
[00:03:44] <User99> ajpiano: ok i understand.
[00:05:32] <User99> ajpiano: i'm getting script errors on jsfiddle and so cannot "run" or add resources. i've checked i have active script enabled in my IE8 browser.
[00:05:57] <ajpiano> why are you devving on ie8
[00:06:00] <ajpiano> its one thing to test in ie
[00:06:04] <ajpiano> its another thing to develop in it
[00:06:14] <ajpiano> User99: you can also try using jsbin.com
[00:06:31] <ajpiano> you mind find the interface a bit less cumbersome and more just like putting a website together
[00:06:33] <ajpiano> YMMV
[00:06:45] <Genesis732> so how would i work with a php variable passed back to a JS script using JSON_encode??
[00:06:51] <bb_ricardo|work> someone up for it on helping an opensource project with a little code contribution icinga.org
[00:07:18] <User99> ajpiano: right. well jsfiddle use to work without showing script errors. not sure why its presenting them nowadays.
[00:08:26] <ajpiano> Genesis732: once you pass the data structure back as JSON, it's not "a php variable" anymore
[00:08:37] <ajpiano> it's data structures in javascript, and you iterate and dowhatever you want to do
[00:08:50] <ajpiano> http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it
[00:09:05] <ajpiano> the fact that that tutorial is loading the stuff from flickr is immaterial, because you're just returning JSON from your backend
[00:10:04] <Genesis732> then $data['error']  would then be  data.error   correct?
[00:10:18] <ajpiano> yes
[00:10:54] <Genesis732> i mean you could, for example... echo what was the contents of PHPs variable $data['error']   with document.write(data.error);
[00:12:07] <ajpiano> but since it's 2011 and mankind has long since learned how to control fire, cultivate livestock, and insert things into the DOM without obliterating the document
[00:12:27] <koriel> goodmorning all....Can i somehow pass an array from a php file to a javascript function?
[00:13:08] <bb_ricardo|work> @all thanks for your help
[00:13:28] <User99> ajpiano: i added jquery-ui.css and mine still looks ugly http://jsfiddle.net/LmFQF/5/
[00:13:50] <ajpiano> you just typed "jquery-ui.css"
[00:13:57] <ajpiano> you have to type the full url to it being hosted somewhere
[00:14:00] <ajpiano> like on the cdn
[00:14:07] <ajpiano> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.16/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[00:15:05] <yii_noob> hi ! where should I add a function to return category list as array in category model or in controller which need it ?
[00:15:21] <yii_noob> oops
[00:15:37] <Genesis732> the thing is, in the PHP file, i set $data['error'] = false   and when it goes back to JS (data.error)  i get an error that says it's NULL  so is there something i'm missing?? it can't be null if it was set
[00:15:58] <ajpiano> you really have to learn how to debug the basics of what is being passed back
[00:16:05] <ajpiano> like what is the phyiscal response, is it being parsed properly, etc.
[00:16:06] <ajpiano> :/
[00:16:50] <muley> so what happened to the jquery grid project that was going to be in jquery ui
[00:16:51] <muley> ?
[00:16:58] <muley> that released yet?
[00:16:59] <ajpiano> its still going on
[00:17:00] <ajpiano> not yet
[00:17:12] <Genesis732> well i'm running firebug, trying to figure out the problem...
[00:17:13] <muley> yeah? do they have any milestones?
[00:17:49] <ajpiano> muley: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid
[00:17:53] <ajpiano> right now it's stage 3
[00:18:12] <muley> sweet
[00:18:26] <muley> so maybe in the next year or so
[00:18:34] <muley> lol
[00:18:54] <Snooops> good morning
[00:19:05] <Hooloovoo> anyone has jquery ui inside info and have a clue to when 1.9 is released?
[00:19:30] <ajpiano> Hooloovoo: i have about as inside info as there can be
[00:19:36] <ajpiano> and i think the answer is "when it's done"
[00:19:55] <Genesis732> so it's not coming back in a parameter.. i just don't know why it's not or how to include it
[00:19:57] <User99> ajpiano:     var $dialog = $('<div></div>')
[00:19:57] <User99>         .html('This dialog will show every time!')
[00:20:08] <Genesis732> because i return the entire array, but it's the only key that's not getting passed back
[00:20:11] <User99> ajpiano:     why is there no semicolon there?
[00:20:26] <ajpiano> wat
[00:20:26] <muley> thanks ajpiano... exactly what i was looking for
[00:22:09] <Hooloovoo> ajpiano: Ahh, ok. Is it in a state where it's usable for development? Like no more changes to the API and stuff.
[00:22:13] <User99> ajpiano: nevermind. i didn't know you can put a carriage return between $('<div></div>') AND  .html('This dialog will show every time!')
[00:25:13] <Genesis730> data.error is the only value not getting passed back from PHP to the JS script even though all the other PHP variables in the array are... I even set the array key to a value and it doesn't get returned :( any ideas why?
[00:26:56] <Snooops> if i do doubleclick on foo a input box appear, if i do doubleclick again ... well http://jsfiddle.net/hcg9V/5/
[00:28:46] <Genesis731> anyone?
[00:29:08] <User99> ajpiano: u there?
[00:30:02] <ajpiano> Genesis731: the error message part works fine, if it's an errot?
[00:30:09] <ajpiano> User99
[00:30:32] <Genesis731> the error is coming from firebug, not the browser
[00:30:35] <User99> ajpiano: would it be smarter to check the dependencies and download the required components?
[00:30:47] <ajpiano> User99: if you're just getting started it really doesn't matter
[00:30:58] <ajpiano> but yes, when it comes to deployment ^^
[00:31:19] <User99> ajpiano: ok
[00:31:33] <Snooops> how can i disable the dblclick function on an element?
[00:32:50] <ajpiano> Snooops: i think event bubbling is tripping you up
[00:32:57] <Genesis731> or another, maybe easier question... I have an image with a class that, when clicked, should run an animation.. How would i target the parent tr of that image... i was thinking something like $(self "tr").animate({   but obviously that doesn't work :(
[00:32:58] <ajpiano> you should check in the click
[00:33:07] <ajpiano> to see if event.target is an input
[00:33:10] <ajpiano> or the span
[00:33:34] <Genesis731> i mean $(this "tr")
[00:33:48] <Snooops> kk
[00:35:36] <ajpiano> Genesis731: $(this).closet("tr")
[00:35:49] <ajpiano> ?traversing
[00:35:50] <bot-t> Docs: Traversing - http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[00:36:31] <juha_> infid: .page() should be the solution
[00:37:57] <Snooops> ajpiano, i got it, i missed a $(this).unbind('dblclick');
[00:38:09] <ajpiano> ok
[00:38:50] <Snooops> now the next question why is my enter not working? if i hit enter on the input box it should appear an alert...
[00:38:54] <Snooops> http://jsfiddle.net/hcg9V/7/
[00:39:13] <Genesis731>  $(this).closet("tr")   is not a function
[00:39:24] <Genesis731> ??
[00:39:47] <Snooops> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:40:09] <Hierofant> Why doesn't fixingthesejquery work on Chrome?
[00:40:11] <DukeDrake> Genesis731: "closet" ?
[00:40:32] <Genesis731> nvm i think it should be closest
[00:40:34] <ajpiano> Hierofant: it doesn't?
[00:40:41] <Hierofant> ajpiano hi!  no, it doesn't
[00:40:48] <ajpiano> it works fine in chrome here
[00:40:49] <Hierofant> the navigation is broken
[00:41:01] <Hierofant> it's stuck on slide 1 with no way to advance
[00:41:27] <Hierofant> oh, the only way it works is the ">" key
[00:41:39] <Hierofant> would be nice if the author mentioned that :p
[00:41:49] <Hierofant> bad UX
[00:42:02] <ajpiano> theres a pop up thing that tells you
[00:42:04] <ajpiano> how to use the site
[00:42:05] <ajpiano> the first time you go
[00:42:10] <juha_> $("fags").come().out().of().the().closet();
[00:42:21] <DukeDrake> lol
[00:43:54] <ajpiano> Hierofant: localStorage.clear()
[00:45:48] <Snooops> is it possible to reload the javascript?

[00:47:06] <rhizmoe> melon = twisted
[00:48:46] <Snooops> why i dont get the alert???

[00:59:07] <Merimac> hi there !
[01:02:28] <User99> ajpiano: u there?
[01:02:35] <ajpiano> mayne
[01:02:39] <ajpiano> be*
[01:02:42] <User99> :D
[01:03:07] <User99> ajpiano: ui dialog has three dependencies.
[01:03:28] <User99> ajpiano: but in download section do i also have to check dialog?
[01:03:37] <ajpiano> yes.
[01:03:44] <Merimac> I'm using jQuery ui to make a popin. I have added a calculation to put my popin, always in middle of my screen, but now I have de a scroll bar after my footer which is equal of my popin !
[01:03:52] <User99> ajpiano: under widget section.
[01:04:22] <User99> ajpiano: ok. another question. once downloaded which script am i suppose to load?
[01:04:42] <ajpiano> all of the ones
[01:04:47] <ajpiano> or there will be a special file in the zip
[01:04:52] <ajpiano> that is everything concatenated together
[01:04:55] <ajpiano> just look in there
[01:04:57] <Merimac> is someone try to do same ?
[01:05:11] <User99> ajpiano: i unzipped it and there are three folders.
[01:05:26] <ajpiano> look inside of the three folders
[01:05:30] <User99> ajpiano: js, css, development-bundle
[01:05:33] <es> eny one help me
[01:05:56] <B_Lizzard> Hi, I need to run a function after one with no suitable callback, can I do this in a generic way in Jquery?
[01:05:57] <es> eny one can help
[01:06:01] <User99> ajpiano: theres about 20+ scripts all up
[01:06:17] <B_Lizzard> I tried queues but I don't think they help.
[01:06:47] <ajpiano> look in the development bundle
[01:06:55] <ajpiano> there should be one like, jquery-ui.js
[01:07:14] <User99> ajpiano: in js folder i see the following: jquery-1.6.2.min.js
[01:07:41] <User99> ajpiano: in js folder i see the following: jquery-1.8.16.custom.min.js
[01:07:49] <ajpiano> that's the one
[01:07:55] <ajpiano> you include those all
[01:08:22] <User99> ajpiano: i include both of those?
[01:08:26] <ajpiano> yes
[01:08:43] <juha_> B_Lizzard: put some demo up in jsfiddle
[01:09:26] <User99> ajpiano: in development-bundle there are heaps of js include the same one but has no "min" in it jquery-1.8.16.custom.js
[01:09:26] <ajpiano> User99: you're allowed to try things without asking me
[01:09:27] <B_Lizzard> Well, would queues work for two functions I've made myself?
[01:09:36] <K1ng> any idea why http://jsfiddle.net/VPSkv/ doesnt work :(
[01:10:21] <User99> ajpiano: do i also include jquery.ui.core.js?
[01:10:32] <User99> ajpiano: do i also include jquery.ui.dialog.js
[01:10:35] <juha_> B_Lizzard: pretty hard to say without any code examples.
[01:10:48] <juha_> B_Lizzard: help us to help you
[01:11:05] <B_Lizzard> heh, I'd be wasting your time.
[01:11:06] <ajpiano> User99: do you know what "concatenated together" means
[01:11:15] <juha_> B_Lizzard: you already are
[01:11:26] <User99> ajpiano: what is concatenated together?
[01:11:29] <ajpiano> the minifed custom thing is in development-bundle/minifed/ etc
[01:11:35] <B_Lizzard> Lemme see if queues or an array of functions works and I'll bother you further if I go nowhere.
[01:11:37] <juha_> B_Lizzard: don't ask if you don't want a solution to your problem.
[01:11:37] <ajpiano> User99: it means it made all the scripts into one file
[01:11:40] <ajpiano> for your convencience
[01:11:49] <B_Lizzard> I wouldn't.
[01:12:24] <ajpiano> B_Lizzard: check out Deffereds
[01:12:33] <B_Lizzard> OK...
[01:12:58] <User99> ajpiano:so jquery-1.8.16.custom.min.js is the cocatenated version? whats the one without the "min"
[01:13:17] <ajpiano> B_Lizzard http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-sf-bay-area/sdptk/
[01:13:18] <B_Lizzard> Ah, this should be it.
[01:13:27] <ajpiano> User99: that's the code concatenated together
[01:13:30] <ajpiano> but not minified
[01:13:37] <ajpiano> for use during development and debugging
[01:14:25] <User99> ajpiano: if concatenated then why i also need this jquery-1.6.2.min.js?
[01:14:36] <ajpiano> it concats the files from jquery ui together
[01:14:40] <ajpiano> it doesn't add jquery as part of that
[01:15:07] <User99> ajpiano: so if i already have jquery then i dont need jquery-1.6.2.min.js
[01:15:12] <ajpiano> yes
[01:15:38] <User99> ajpiano: i just need to include  jquery-1.8.16.custom.min.js AND the css for it.
[01:16:01] <ajpiano> yes
[01:16:56] <User99> ajpiano: right i was confused because i thought jquery ui is a separate library but it include jquery as part of its download
[01:17:34] <aaronmcadam> yeah User99 the clue is in the name :)
[01:17:45] <sector119> How to add global ajax handler that catch request timeouts?
[01:18:22] <User99> aaronmcadam: then its not entirely a separate library then is it.
[01:18:33] <aaronmcadam> course it's not
[01:18:59] <aaronmcadam> what did you read that made you think that
[01:19:14] <User99> aaronmcadam: ok. someone said it was so it threw me off course.
[01:19:29] <aaronmcadam> ah damn noobs teachin noobs then :P
[01:20:03] <User99> aaronmcadam: lol yup.
[01:32:43] <gavin_huang> Hi guys. any idea on how to animate the clip css style?
[01:35:28] <angelkoilov> gavin_huang: $().animate()
[01:36:55] <gavin_huang> angelkoilov, animate() doesn't seem to support clip.
[01:40:06] <angelkoilov> gavin_huang: i havent tested :), anyway ... can u write your own animate method ?
[01:40:41] <gavin_huang> angelkoilov, you mean write a plugin myself?
[01:41:10] <angelkoilov> or simple function :)
[01:42:02] <angelkoilov> gavin_huang: the best is to extend jquery.animate to support clip :)
[01:44:22] <gavin_huang> angelkoilov, I've tried plugins written by others in the plugin repo. Don't seem to work with 1.6.4. Digging into the source code I found that they extend jQuery.fx.step.clip, looks like an internal API to me. Is there any document on that?
[01:45:17] <angelkoilov> gavin_huang: i dont know
[01:45:38] <gavin_huang> angelkoilov, ok. thx any way. :)
[02:04:51] <iaincarsberg> Hello, is it possible to submit json encoded data in the request body using jquery?
[02:07:45] <tyrone> hi people... I am super noob at using jquery and javascript in general. I have a button with formated text in it and I have an event handler which uses $(event.trigger).attr('id') to perform an ajax query.... only trouble is if I click on the text in the button instead of firing the button's event it fires it's own event and (event.target) then points to the wrong target :(
[02:08:52] <nail_> iaincarsberg: set 'data' to your json string, and set 'processData' to false (tha'ts an option to $.ajax)
[02:09:29] <iaincarsberg> nail_: do I need to manually stringify my data object?
[02:09:39] <rosieres> can somebody tellme why content is not loaded into "#content" -> http://jsfiddle.net/szuEJ/6/
[02:09:51] <Usse> @tyrone you can try with http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:12:46] <nail_> iaincarsberg: if you set processData to false it will post the content of 'data' as a string, so if it's an object that does not stringify automatically as a valid json string, yes, you'll need to do it
[02:13:21] <tyrone> thanks Usse. will that not mean that whenever the text is clicked that instead of firing the parent button's event nothing will happen?
[02:13:34] <iaincarsberg> nail_: cool thanks, just tested and it works perfectly :)
[02:17:36] <nail_> iaincarsberg: you probably also want to set the 'contentType' option to something appropriate
[02:36:25] <aaronmcadam> you can't use the ready event with live/delegate can you?
[02:37:20] <dinosaadeh> guys if i bind a div to click, can i detect if the click was on the farmost right edge with jquery?
[02:37:47] <iaincarsberg> nail_: ah yeah did that on auto pilot, thats though
[02:40:24] <aaronmcadam> dinosaadeh: you can check it's offset
[02:41:20] <dinosaadeh> aaronmcadam: offset of?
[02:42:02] <aaronmcadam> the div obvs
[02:42:36] <aaronmcadam> the event.target might tell you
[02:42:50] <aaronmcadam> question is why
[02:42:59] <aaronmcadam> there's probably a better solution
[02:43:49] <aaronmcadam> so why do you want the the right edge dinosaadeh
[02:44:04] <DragoneneWork> I'm having a problem that's only slightly jquery-related - more of a general javascript question
[02:44:41] <DragoneneWork> I'm seeing delay on iPhone touch input - I know that there's a delay on onMouseX events, but I seem to be getting it even when using onTouchX, and I don't know why
[02:44:51] <DragoneneWork> no delay when browsing from an android browser
[02:45:01] <DragoneneWork> any ideas?
[02:45:04] <aaronmcadam> jesus
[02:45:22] <DragoneneWork> ...jesus?
[02:45:28] <aaronmcadam> touch events are a bit fucked up
[02:45:43] <DragoneneWork> mm - I've gotten this working fine before though
[02:45:50] <DragoneneWork> I don't know what's going wrong this time :/
[02:45:54] <dinosaadeh> aaronmcadam: the who div has a background showing an X on right edge.. I want the user to click there to delete an entry, and if he clicks anywhere else in that div to do something else
[02:46:01] <aaronmcadam> quirksmode
[02:46:10] <aaronmcadam> ppk has a good run down of them issues]
[02:46:14] <dinosaadeh> i am going to use autocomplete to like add labels
[02:46:42] <aaronmcadam> that's not the best way to do that
[02:46:55] <aaronmcadam> the delete button should be an anchor
[02:46:57] <aaronmcadam> or a span at least
[02:47:22] <aaronmcadam> it's gonna be really hacky code to do it the way ur thinkin
[02:47:52] <aaronmcadam> DragoneneWork: there is a delay on touch events
[02:48:31] <Vespakoen> Hey guys, if i have a form with inputs (some inputs have class "required") and next to them are divs with class "error"  how can i find the closest div "error" when $(this) = the input
[02:48:35] <aaronmcadam> there should be some delay
[02:48:37] <DragoneneWork> there must be some way for me to detect the touch without a hugue delay
[02:48:41] <DragoneneWork> it's like half a second now
[02:48:44] <DragoneneWork> that's simply too much
[02:48:56] <aaronmcadam> something else must be effecting it
[02:49:06] <ravenzz> ?next @ Vespakoen
[02:49:07] <bot-t> Vespakoen, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[02:49:14] <aaronmcadam> ?closest @ Vespakoen
[02:49:14] <bot-t> Vespakoen, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:49:15] <DragoneneWork> aaronmcadam: You're confusing me
[02:49:22] <aaronmcadam> great
[02:49:33] <Vespakoen> up the dom tree
[02:49:35] <Vespakoen> i need to go down
[02:49:36] <DragoneneWork> first you said "there's a delay", then "there should be a delay", then "something else is affecting it"
[02:49:41] <aaronmcadam> kk
[02:49:41] <ravenzz> Vespakoen so next
[02:49:43] <Vespakoen> next isnt just 1 element ?
[02:49:52] <DragoneneWork> Vespakoen: children?
[02:49:54] <aaronmcadam> no u can feed it a selector
[02:49:55] <Genesis731> how far down the hierarchy do you need to go?
[02:50:01] <Vespakoen> it could be <input> <somethingelse> <div class="error">
[02:50:06] <aaronmcadam> is it a sibling or a child Vespakoen
[02:50:09] <DragoneneWork> child / children
[02:50:12] <DragoneneWork> is down the tree
[02:50:19] <Vespakoen> sorry i mean
[02:50:20] <aaronmcadam> that's an anscestor
[02:50:46] <aaronmcadam> so you want $(this).find('.error;) Vespakoen
[02:50:48] <Vespakoen> <input class="required" /> <span class="info">okido</span> <span class="error"></span>
[02:51:06] <DragoneneWork> sibling would be the way to go
[02:51:24] <Vespakoen> ?sibling
[02:51:25] <bot-t> Vespakoen, .siblings() - Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[02:51:26] <aaronmcadam> he said his this is the input
[02:51:39] <Vespakoen> yeh
[02:51:41] <aaronmcadam> the error span is not a sibling
[02:51:42] <Vespakoen> so it will be find
[02:51:45] <aaronmcadam> yes
[02:51:54] <Vespakoen> ok guys, i know enough thanks!
[02:51:57] <DragoneneWork> oh sorry, he's in the input
[02:52:01] <ravenzz> Vespakoen http://jsfiddle.net/2YrYf/
[02:52:02] <DragoneneWork> sibling would be related to the span
[02:52:07] <aaronmcadam> yup
[02:52:10] <DragoneneWork> it's a child of input
[02:52:17] <aaronmcadam> aye
[02:52:17] <DragoneneWork> so child's what you want
[02:53:06] <DragoneneWork> now, as for the touch delay...
[02:53:13] <DragoneneWork> any ideas?
[02:53:18] <Vespakoen> Firebug ?
[02:53:22] <Vespakoen> NET
[02:53:27] <Vespakoen> or is it on a phone ?
[02:53:35] <aaronmcadam> i've had these issues before DragoneneWork
[02:53:45] <Vespakoen> You could try firebug light maybe if its on a phone
[02:53:49] <aaronmcadam> but mostly were fixed by the lib I use
[02:53:54] <aaronmcadam> nah that won't work
[02:54:13] <aaronmcadam> firebug lite on that size screen, shit I've not even tried it but that'd be painful
[02:55:55] <DragoneneWork> phone
[02:56:12] <DragoneneWork> it works fine on android with default browser
[02:56:15] <DragoneneWork> I get delay in android
[02:56:32] <aaronmcadam> are you using any libs DragoneneWork

[03:02:34] <aaronmcadam> right
[03:02:40] <aaronmcadam> not looked a jqm?

[03:08:08] <walid> hi guys!
[03:08:16] <walid> anyone familiar with quicksand?
[03:08:28] <walid> i'm trying to implement smth, but i can't get it right :(
[03:09:28] <walid> basically i have a list of items that can get reorganized by this quicksand plugin, and i need to be able to either order it by sections, or to filter items belonging to that specific section.
[03:09:50] <djj_> can any help me with this problem I am having with my datepicker? http://jsfiddle.net/E8WQ5/59/
[03:10:47] <walid> thing is, i also want to have categories, meaning that for example when i'm browsing a category, the sections should only order items belonging to that section
[03:10:52] <walid> category*
[03:11:04] <walid> example here: www.vbbros.net/d6
[03:16:09] <nail_> djj_: you didn't explain your problem, but obviously you at least want to change var option = this.id == "input[name=min]"
[03:16:18] <nail_> into var option = $(this).is("input[name=min]")
[03:18:47] <djj_> nail: The problem i was having was that from my jsfiddle if you selected todays date 15th September then tried to select a "To" date it would only allow you to select the previous dates.
[03:19:13] <djj_> I can't believe that it was something as small as that which caused the datepicker not to work
[03:19:59] <nail_> ok, so that solved it
[03:22:17] <djj_> nial: it certainly did
[03:22:31] <djj_> nial: cheers (y)
[03:23:08] <nail_> no worries
[03:23:45] <diegoviola> hi
[03:34:10] <Clorith> Has anyone else experienced issues with IE and jqueryui's datepicker when displaying multiple months in a single column ? (I'm using [6,1] to get 6 months in 1 column). It seems to muck up in IE9 quirks mode, IE8 and IE7, which is obviously an issue as IE8 is stil lvery widespread
[03:34:14] <enknot> pepoles
[03:39:54] <Deele> hey
[03:40:15] <Deele> I just downloaded jqUI blitzer package
[03:40:27] <Deele> and looks like CSS file is missing many parts
[03:40:41] <Deele> even ui-default-state style
[03:40:49] <Deele> what could be a problem?
[03:46:33] <Deele> Hello?
[03:51:07] <mickkelo> hi

[04:08:38] <Merbster> I am trying to select some radiobuttons by checking the name of the element and the value of "value" attribute. Does anyone have an example of this? - because I cannot get it to work.
[04:12:46] <Ankabout> how do I add a new div inside a parent, either at the beginning, or before another child?
[04:14:14] <martind-79> join #ampache
[04:14:49] <yii_noob> how can I get the selected text when selection changes please ?
[04:15:07] <yii_noob> $(this).val() is saying the value 0, 1...
[04:15:24] <yii_noob> but want to update an other elementa based on the text
[04:15:42] <yii_noob> should I .each ?
[04:17:35] <Merbster> How would I select a radiobutton with name="ins_200" and value="Omk" ?
[04:18:22] <Jon47> merbster: $('[name="ins_200"][value="Omk"]') would be one way
[04:18:59] <yii_noob> how can I get a dropdown text when I change it ?
[04:19:00] <Jon47> $('input[type=radio][name="ins_200"][value="Omk"]')
[04:19:32] <Merbster> Jon47, I used that. but the radiobutton is still nok marked as checked. (I called .prop('checked', true) on the selector you just wrote)
[04:20:11] <Jon47> Merbster, narrow down the problem, first make sure your selector is matching the elements you expect
[04:20:54] <Jon47> secondly, ask google, this is a really easy problem
[04:20:55] <Merbster> Jon47, Do you have a nice tip to see what element is returned in my selector? - I have been singlestepping the code and I am sure it hits the selector and calls the prop() function on it. But nothing happens
[04:21:06] <Merbster> I have googled and experimented for 4-5 hours now
[04:21:07] <Jon47> console.log
[04:21:20] <Jon47> you could not possibly have asked google
[04:21:21] <Jon47> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-how-to-make-radio-button-selected
[04:21:41] <Deele> is there any "working" copy of jQUI?
[04:21:42] <Merbster> Jon47, I did. and the approach I just told you about does not work.
[04:21:43] <Jon47> "how to make radio button selected" that is the exact same question you saked
[04:21:55] <Jon47> gotta run
[04:32:56] <Chibby_> does anyone know if there's something similar to the select() function but works on text that isn't in an input:text or textarea element?

[04:48:16] <DragoneneWork> aaronmcadam: #jquerymobile seems completely dead
[04:48:27] <DragoneneWork> I tried switching to jqmobile, but it didn't really help at all
[04:48:38] <DragoneneWork> it just messed up my site by changing the background to a gray one
[04:49:30] <aaronmcadam> it is yr
[04:50:02] <aaronmcadam> don't include the css
[04:50:06] <aaronmcadam> if u don't want the styling
[04:51:02] <DragoneneWork> well
[04:51:03] <DragoneneWork> yeah
[04:51:11] <DragoneneWork> just figured that a default background is a bad thing to have in the css
[04:51:46] <DragoneneWork> anyway - it didn't seem to help :/
[04:52:59] <DragoneneWork>  also, even without the css it messes up the page appearance
[04:53:11] <DragoneneWork> making my container div selectable for one thing
[04:53:14] <DragoneneWork> with some sort of outline
[04:53:25] <DragoneneWork> and also lets me hold my image to download it - which wasn't there b efore
[04:53:27] <DragoneneWork> before*
[04:56:32] <Fullmoon> I am assigning even / odd classes to 'tbody td' elements on dom:ready, now I want to do the same whenever tables are added, let's say from an ajax request that returns an HTML fragment to the DOM? What is the best practice here?
[04:57:47] <Deele> y7*
[05:04:04] <xec> Fullmoon: you could just reapply the classes in your success handler
[05:04:19] <Fullmoon> xec: Yeah, but I'd like a more general solution
[05:04:41] <Fullmoon> Something like an " new element added " event that I can instate in ready
[05:04:50] <Fullmoon> That's what I'll do for now
[05:05:00] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:05:11] <xec> Fullmoon: if you're only applying classes for styling i would use css' :nth-child
[05:05:12] <aaronmcadam> you're more than likely going to have to reparse the html
[05:05:51] <xec> Fullmoon: i.e. avoiding the class on odd rows entirely
[05:05:55] <aaronmcadam> abstract to a function and call it on ready and inside a delegate that calls the extra data
[05:06:08] <Fullmoon> xec: I have order not to do this, I think because of IE
[05:06:19] <aaronmcadam> not with actual css
[05:06:21] <Fullmoon> As a matter of fact, I think I have to emulate this, because of IE
[05:06:23] <aaronmcadam> the selector
[05:06:34] <aaronmcadam> just use :odd or :even
[05:06:41] <aaronmcadam> zebra striping right?
[05:07:59] <DragoneneWork> right
[05:08:04] <DragoneneWork> i found the cause of the delay
[05:08:13] <aaronmcadam> go onnnn
[05:08:28] <DragoneneWork> okay, so ontouchstart / end i do two things:
[05:08:43] <Fullmoon> aaronmcadam: Correct
[05:08:48] <aaronmcadam> Fullmoon: what's wrong with $('td:even').addClass('odd')
[05:08:53] <DragoneneWork> 1) An ajax call to send information to elsewhere, and 2) change an image into another
[05:08:55] <DragoneneWork> in that order
[05:08:56] <aaronmcadam> have u tried that
[05:09:06] <aaronmcadam> yeah i was thinkin it would be your callbacks
[05:09:14] <DragoneneWork> apparently, changing the image source causes a delay in the ajax call
[05:09:23] <DragoneneWork> even though i change the image *after* i do the ajax call
[05:09:40] <DragoneneWork> and only when using safari, for whatever reason
[05:09:40] <aaronmcadam> is it an input type image?
[05:09:54] <DragoneneWork> no, just an <img>
[05:10:12] <DragoneneWork> ontouchstart i change the image's .src value via js
[05:10:12] <aaronmcadam> DragoneneWork: think about it
[05:10:25] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to use deferreds
[05:10:32] <aaronmcadam> it's asynchronous
[05:10:38] <gnarf> wee demo: http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[05:10:44] <DragoneneWork> right okay
[05:10:46] <aaronmcadam> so the browser fires the request and then tries to change the image and then your callback fires
[05:11:08] <DragoneneWork> any suggestion on how i'd change the image without causing the delay?
[05:11:09] <aaronmcadam> if you must do something afterwards like that and must be in order, use deffereds
[05:11:16] <aaronmcadam> it's covered here
[05:11:19] <DragoneneWork> not sure how to

[05:12:15] <gnarf> http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#1
[05:12:22] <aaronmcadam> if that's the case, you should be using a link

[05:12:57] <gnarf> ^^^ links on deferred
[05:13:20] <DragoneneWork> ack, aaronmcadam, that's a pain to navigate
[05:13:26] <DragoneneWork> aaronmcadam: yes, pretty much
[05:13:29] <aaronmcadam> it is
[05:13:33] <aaronmcadam> but the content is awesome
[05:13:35] <DragoneneWork> think I should use a link with an image and just do :active?
[05:13:37] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: check out that demo
[05:13:41] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: lemme know what you think :)
[05:13:53] <DragoneneWork> hm eh
[05:13:57] <aaronmcadam> what demop
[05:13:59] <DragoneneWork> not sure how to change images with css in any case
[05:14:02] <aaronmcadam> yeah use a:active DragoneneWork
[05:14:02] <DragoneneWork> is that even possible?
[05:14:07] <aaronmcadam> uh ur crazy
[05:14:12] <aaronmcadam> background image on a link
[05:14:17] <aaronmcadam> css 101 simples
[05:14:27] <branant> Is there a plugin that draws an inner shadow on an image?
[05:14:36] <aaronmcadam> CSS3
[05:14:40] <aaronmcadam> :p
[05:15:09] <aaronmcadam> branant: what server side lang u using
[05:15:10] <DragoneneWork> aaronmcadam: oO background image on a link, don't think I've seen that
[05:15:13] <DragoneneWork> if it works, then fine
[05:15:15] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[05:15:18] <aaronmcadam> are you crazy?
[05:15:22] <aaronmcadam> half the web uses it
[05:15:27] <DragoneneWork> I'm sure
[05:15:31] <DragoneneWork> that doesn't mean *I've* seen it
[05:15:32] <Jon47> Merbster, sorry for my short comments earlier, did you find an answer?
[05:15:40] <DragoneneWork> I don't work as a web dev :)
[05:15:40] <aaronmcadam> you never heard of text replacement
[05:15:42] <branant> aaronmcadam: php
[05:16:01] <aaronmcadam> branant: imagemagick or gd do image manips much faster
[05:16:11] <aaronmcadam> phpthumb is a nice wrapper for it, check it out
[05:16:17] <aaronmcadam> great..
[05:16:40] <branant> alright I'll check it out
[05:16:43] <branant> thanks
[05:16:45] <aaronmcadam> np
[05:16:57] <aaronmcadam> you could overlay a png with the shadow branant
[05:17:00] <aaronmcadam> that would work
[05:17:14] <aaronmcadam> transparent like
[05:17:24] <aaronmcadam> it's easy I've done it before
[05:17:25] <Merbster> Jon47, Nope. I have tried both setting .checked directly on the selector and using prop() like jquery docs shows examples to do.
[05:17:35] <Merbster> Jon47, but it's not quite THAT simple.
[05:17:47] <aaronmcadam> what's the issue
[05:18:08] <aaronmcadam> attr('checked',true) ain't working?
[05:18:34] <Lochlan> attr('checked','checked')
[05:18:39] <DragoneneWork> hm, aaronmcadam, there's a reason I had switched from having the image as background on a div into having it as an image, though...
[05:18:43] <aaronmcadam> same thing Lochlan
[05:18:56] <aaronmcadam> go on
[05:18:59] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, I am using prop instead of attr. becaus in the new version of JQ attr is only the initial state of the radiobutton where as prop is "live" (i.e. you see the change NOW)
[05:19:01] <DragoneneWork> if you have it as an image and scale it down, iPhone4 will handle it awesomely and use retina graphics
[05:19:06] <aaronmcadam> seeing that you're not a web dev
[05:19:21] <DragoneneWork> not sure how I'd do that with a background image
[05:19:26] <aaronmcadam> my god that's what your worried about?
[05:19:35] <DragoneneWork> I wouldn't say worried
[05:19:36] <aaronmcadam> @2x in your image name
[05:19:39] <aaronmcadam> it works
[05:19:52] <aaronmcadam> used to use that on jqTouch projects fine
[05:20:01] <DragoneneWork> no need for the "my god", I'm just not that experienced with these things
[05:20:03] <DragoneneWork> thanks. :)
[05:20:16] <aaronmcadam> what are u exp. with?
[05:20:48] <DragoneneWork> I work as a game developer
[05:20:55] <Merbster> Jon47, but thank you for checking back, that is a rare sight @ irc ;)
[05:21:00] <aaronmcadam> c#/c++?
[05:21:06] <DragoneneWork> among others
[05:21:12] <aaronmcadam> java?
[05:21:15] <DragoneneWork> mostly c#, c++ and as3
[05:21:18] <aaronmcadam> *shudder*
[05:21:18] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[05:21:19] <DragoneneWork> java too
[05:21:25] <Jon47> Merbster, prop should be working .. check this example out: http://jsfiddle.net/KCY3U/
[05:21:27] <aaronmcadam> python?
[05:21:38] <aaronmcadam> it's gotta be a bad selector
[05:21:45] <DragoneneWork> haven't done python, no
[05:21:51] <DragoneneWork> looks pretty easy tho
[05:21:55] <aaronmcadam> check what the $(this) is inside your selector Merbster
[05:22:02] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's awesome
[05:22:04] <DragoneneWork> but impractical for large-scale distribution
[05:22:09] <DragoneneWork> same issue as java really
[05:22:12] <aaronmcadam> and c++ is?
[05:22:22] <DragoneneWork> well, I hate c++ as a language
[05:22:35] <DragoneneWork> but relatively easy to distribute :)
[05:22:38] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, that is what I am suspecting too. (a bad selector) I am trying to isolate the problem and just get it selected.
[05:22:45] <DragoneneWork> more importantly, it's used for lots of phones
[05:22:46] <Merbster> Thank you for your suggestions I will test some more and report back
[05:23:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah log out the this Merbster
[05:23:46] <aaronmcadam> java is *meant* to be portable tho
[05:24:00] <DragoneneWork> yeah, but it isn't really :)
[05:24:06] <DragoneneWork> so, to make sure I understand you correctly: I'll use an image a.png scaled for normal screens, and for iPhone4, I'll put an image a@2x.png next to it in the same folder
[05:24:10] <DragoneneWork> and iPhone4 will find it?
[05:24:12] <aaronmcadam> read the docs
[05:24:14] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, yes I will, and thank you for the tip.
[05:24:21] <aaronmcadam> no worries
[05:25:14] <_axx> is there a way, to change settings of a jquery plugin, without "reloading" it? -> https://gist.github.com/fce41847d2cee9710fec
[05:25:26] <aaronmcadam> DragoneneWork: http://flowz.com/2010/07/css-image-replacement-for-iphone-4-high-dpi-retina-display/
[05:25:36] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, just to clarify, you want me to check the value of $(this) in a callback function hooked up to the selector?
[05:25:41] <aaronmcadam> yup
[05:25:45] <DragoneneWork> right, cheers
[05:26:03] <aaronmcadam> have you read any docs on iphone specific stuff?
[05:26:16] <aaronmcadam> or did u just look at it and go "oh cool"
[05:26:34] <Fullmoon> I'm struggling to find out there an ajax response was served from the server or the browser cache, status is always 200
[05:26:47] <Fullmoon> I only have to update the page if the server actually did sent new data
[05:26:49] <aaronmcadam> why do u need to kno?
[05:26:55] <aaronmcadam> ah
[05:27:17] <aaronmcadam> in a beforeSend
[05:27:21] <aaronmcadam> you could maybe test
[05:27:48] <aaronmcadam> for a newData class or something
[05:28:07] <aaronmcadam> could do with a more elegant solution tho
[05:29:23] <zulu-gula> what is called jquery function that runs function each period of time?
[05:29:38] <Lochlan> set timer? javascript
[05:29:56] <Fullmoon> aaronmcadam: Basically, I am polling, right? And I use a conditional get, and if the server has no fresh data, I actually don't even need to handle the response
[05:30:50] <notnek> zulu-gula: setInterval? just js
[05:30:53] <seutje> whoa, using css to set a property for js to catch and do some content-replacement
[05:30:59] <aaronmcadam> fuckin skype
[05:31:02] <seutje> that doesn't feel nasty at all! :D
[05:31:11] <zulu-gula> yes yes. I forgot function name :)
[05:32:06] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: .attr("checked"  is wrong in 1.6+ - not that it doesn't work, but you should be using .prop()
[05:32:32] <aaronmcadam> but checked is a html attr too
[05:32:39] <beroz> Dears,I am using JQueryMobile ,  I have 2 pages and I would like to submit a paramter from the first page to the second page.. I successfully submit the param but I don't know how to get its value in the second page, is the re any small example?
[05:32:49] <aaronmcadam> so u need to use checked,checked when using attr now
[05:32:50] <aaronmcadam> got it
[05:33:04] <aaronmcadam> #jquerymobile beroz
[05:33:04] <gnarf> true - but 9/10 times u want .prop not .attr for checked
[05:33:09] <Lochlan> i thought i said that
[05:33:29] <beroz> aaronmcadam, thanks :)
[05:33:40] <aaronmcadam> gnarf are you saying the html attr could get updated but the computed DOM won't?
[05:33:57] <gnarf> im saying the two are not connected... the html attr is NEVER updated
[05:34:12] <gnarf> i don't belive setting the attribute affects the DOM property either
[05:34:51] <aaronmcadam> cool
[05:35:46] <aaronmcadam> prop('checked', true) then
[05:35:48] <aaronmcadam> ?
[05:36:59] <aaronmcadam> jesus jsfiddle must be getting battered these days
[05:37:07] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, the selector is correct when I isolate the whole piece to just that one thing. I used .each on the selector, wrote it to the console, and when I clicked the console I landed on the correct HTML element. Also when I try prop('checked', true) it sets the radio button all right.
[05:37:08] <aaronmcadam> it's sooo slow to load
[05:37:13] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: did you look at my timepicker at all?
[05:37:26] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: and yeah, on .prop( "checked", true )
[05:37:34] <aaronmcadam> em no u didn't send me the link gnarf
[05:37:41] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[05:38:39] <aaronmcadam> u can't click to enter
[05:38:49] <aaronmcadam> it keeps jumping back to the first couple of digits
[05:39:20] <gnarf> yeah, click focus issues
[05:39:24] <gnarf> on the bugs list
[05:39:25] <gnarf> :)
[05:39:36] <gnarf> thats just my first draft really
[05:39:42] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:40:02] <aaronmcadam> I dunno about the ui, it's still a tricky problem

[05:47:00] <DragoneneWork> aaronmcadam: changing to a link with background image and an :active state did not resolve the issue
[05:47:17] <DragoneneWork> though if i remove the :active atate, the issue disappears (that is, i remove the image switching)
[05:47:44] <aaronmcadam> it's hard to know what exactly u want
[05:48:22] <DragoneneWork> I just want it to switch images without that causing a delay in the ajax calls
[05:48:34] <DragoneneWork> I figure since it works fine on android it should be possible...
[05:48:40] <aaronmcadam> active is what you want
[05:48:51] <DragoneneWork> As I said, didn't help. :/
[05:48:55] <aaronmcadam> DragoneneWork: you're misunderstanding me
[05:49:03] <DragoneneWork> very possible
[05:49:03] <aaronmcadam> i already said what your problem was
[05:49:15] <DragoneneWork> please elaborate
[05:49:16] <aaronmcadam> you're used to coding in a synchronous way right
[05:49:23] <aaronmcadam> line 1 runs, line 2 runs in order
[05:49:25] <aaronmcadam> etc etc
[05:49:33] <DragoneneWork> yes
[05:49:39] <aaronmcadam> you're running line 1, it goes off and does something, then line 2 runs straight away
[05:49:45] <aaronmcadam> and then line 1's callback comes back
[05:49:49] <aaronmcadam> that's your problem

[05:56:08] <jugstah> good morning folks
[05:56:35] <User99> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/D7BMD/16/ <-- how to remove title header alltogether?
[05:56:37] <aaronmcadam> soz gnarf I'll test it for u later, gotta do some work
[05:58:15] <DragoneneWork> I... don't see how the issue is what you said, aaronmcadam. It's probably me being ignorant, but... consider this: I have a website that changes a link background image via css only -  no JS involved. When I touch the link, I make an ajax call. This ajax called is delayed IF AND ONLY IF I actually change the image with css. If I don't change it, then there's no delay at all.
[05:58:42] <jugstah> $('input[name="applicant_rent_own"]').click(); will emulate a click and trigger one of my .change() functions right?
[05:58:49] <jugstah> on document.ready?
[05:59:12] <aaronmcadam> there's something else going wrong
[05:59:21] <aaronmcadam> I gotta get some work done sorry
[06:00:14] <DragoneneWork> go ahead.
[06:00:37] <DragoneneWork> but I don't think there's something else going wrong. If there was, it wouldn't be completely and utterly delay free as soon as I stop swapping the image.
[06:00:37] <Deele> any new jQuery UI specialist here?
[06:00:55] <Dreamersrs> Has anyone here ever worked with AJAXIFY
[06:01:01] <Dreamersrs> It's a JQuery plugin, and I can't seem to get it working
[06:01:09] <Dreamersrs> Chrome's console tells me that the object has no method 'ajaxify'
[06:01:15] <Dreamersrs> regardless of the fact that I've included every file in the ajaxify plugin
[06:01:54] <Dreamersrs> http://max.jsrhost.com/ajaxify/ that's the site, if you want to look
[06:02:23] <Dreamersrs> Anyone at all?
[06:03:13] <Dreamersrs> Anyone?
[06:03:40] <Dreamersrs> Anyone at all?
[06:04:37] <Dreamersrs> Nobody at all here?
[06:04:54] <pachet> its early ;(
[06:05:10] <pachet> whats your question, i joined late
[06:05:23] <Dreamersrs> I'm using something called AJAXIFY
[06:05:35] <Dreamersrs> It's a JQuery Plugin that I can't seem to get working
[06:05:52] <Dreamersrs> Google Chrome's dev console tells me that the object has no method 'ajaxify'
[06:06:04] <Dreamersrs> even though I've included all the ajaxify files
[06:07:00] <Dreamersrs> It's basically $('.classtoajaxify').ajaxify();
[06:07:10] <Dreamersrs> that's the only line in the HTML, other than including the actual JS files
[06:07:18] <Dreamersrs> and it's the line with the error
[06:07:25] <TrueColors> Do you have a live url?
[06:07:29] <pachet> ^
[06:07:30] <quicksilver> put it in document.ready
[06:07:37] <quicksilver> so it doesn't run until all your JS is loaded.
[06:07:49] <TrueColors> ^
[06:07:52] <Dreamersrs> My problem is instead of it loading into a div box
[06:08:05] <Dreamersrs> it simply uses the link as a normal anchor
[06:08:10] <Dreamersrs> and takes you to that page
[06:08:25] <Dreamersrs> The documentation says use target="#div"
[06:08:35] <Dreamersrs> http://max.jsrhost.com/ajaxify/
[06:08:44] <Dreamersrs> That has the actual JS, and the demo
[06:09:07] <Dreamersrs> I did notice it says target"#div" without an equals on the attribute
[06:09:18] <Dreamersrs> but I tested without, and still used as a normal anchor
[06:09:35] <TrueColors> I shall ask again ... do you have a live url/
[06:09:58] <Dreamersrs> I don't, I'm working on localhost at the moment
[06:09:59] <quicksilver> Dreamersrs: none of that is relevant, as long as you're seeing an error "no method ajaxify"
[06:10:04] <quicksilver> you surely need to fix that first.
[06:10:16] <TrueColors> $(function() { $('.classtoajaxify').ajaxify(); });
[06:10:17] <TrueColors> or something idk
[06:11:07] <jugstah> is there a trick to executing something both on document ready and also during a .change();?
[06:11:38] <aaronmcadam> jugstah: yeah, it's called a function
[06:12:30] <Dreamersrs> I just noticed the error report was coming from jquery-latest.js:854
[06:12:41] <Dreamersrs> Line 854: throw e;
[06:13:52] <jugstah> aaron- thanks, i'll go look some more.. im relatively new to jquery :-)
[06:14:05] <erichynds> jugstah: you probably want $("select").change(fn).trigger("change");
[06:15:09] <jugstah> erich- that'll run the function on document.ready and also on any .change events? sweet.. thanks.. i'll go revise my code :-)
[06:15:52] <erichynds> jugstah: if you put that code block within a document.ready statement, yep
[06:16:11] <erichynds> jugstah: basically binding the event and immediately triggering it
[06:16:14] <jugstah> i created two sets, one for when loaded and the other for .change();
[06:16:21] <jugstah> im sure that was redundant :-)
[06:16:27] <Jon47> what's the best way to check if a variable is not defined?
[06:16:27] <Jon47> x === undefined, x == undefined, typeof x == 'undefined', etc...?
[06:17:28] <jugstah> $('input[name="applicant_rent_own"]').change(function().trigger("change") {
[06:17:36] <jugstah> ddoes that look valid to you, erich?
[06:17:45] <erichynds> no
[06:17:54] <erichynds> .change(function(){}).trigger("change");
[06:17:54] <Aldus> Hi. In DatePicker 1.7.3 I want a datepicker-enabled textfield to open its popup through an external event. I tried with $('#myfield').datepicker("show") but doesn't work... anybody has a guess?
[06:19:51] <pachet> Jon47: (typeof foo === "undefined")
[06:21:09] <Jon47> pachet, why is that the best?
[06:21:41] <PrgmrBill> if I get $('#selector') is NULL and it's inside document.ready, what am I doing wrong?
[06:22:04] <Jon47> prgmrbill its null? liek it's not even a jquery object?
[06:22:50] <enknot> welll helloooooo
[06:23:11] <enknot> i'm trying to get the id of the button I click in the click handler
[06:23:25] <enknot> and I get the text with $(this).text();
[06:23:26] <PrgmrBill> Jon47: says TypeError: $("#contentWrapper") is null
[06:23:30] <enknot> but the id comes up undefined...?
[06:23:44] <enknot> wwwhhhhhyyyy?
[06:23:44] <Jon47> PrgmrBill can you make us a fiddle?
[06:24:14] <enknot> anyone?
[06:24:25] <PrgmrBill> well, I'm not even sure how to reproduce this problem
[06:24:51] <Jon47> enknot, fiddle
[06:25:48] <pachet> Jon47: because you want to test against a string literal, not the value of the undefined object
[06:26:05] <pachet> i guess == and === are equal in this case, since typeof returns a string
[06:26:27] <Jon47> pachet sounds good
[06:26:29] <Jon47> thank you sir
[06:26:32] <enknot> Jon47 I did
[06:26:32] <pachet> yw
[06:26:47] <enknot> Jon47 got it working.... hadda remove the $() wrapper
[06:26:48] <enknot> werid
[06:27:07] <enknot> whatever.... thanks jquery gods... and you Jon47
[06:27:12] <erichynds> PrgmrBill: $ isn't jQuery in your case
[06:27:27] <erichynds> sounds like something overwrote it
[06:28:32] <PrgmrBill> I don't have anything other than jquery on this site, though
[06:28:36] <magcius> Is there an easy way to get a text node?

[06:30:29] <magcius> Using raw DOM bindings, I'd create two text nodes and a <b> element in a document fragment.
[06:30:43] <magcius> is there a jQuery-ier way?

[06:54:49] <bot-t> cook1es, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);

[06:55:01] <bot-t> cook1es, hoverIntent | jQuery Plugins - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[06:57:07] <cook1es> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/uMGZ3/1/ like this?
[07:01:09] <Guest42450> can some one please help me with ajax and validation please
[07:01:53] <Guest42450> any jquery guru please
[07:01:55] <ateam> any ideas, scrolling is not working properly: http://pastie.org/2531799
[07:02:00] <pachet> cook1es: http://jsfiddle.net/UKZCp/1/
[07:02:41] <pachet> actually you'll probably want that cleartimeout nested in the first if
[07:03:27] <cook1es> patchet: it works except attr("id", "") is never called (no list items loses the id)
[07:03:34] <cook1es> pachet: ^
[07:03:48] <sean`> I like patchet more
[07:04:28] <cook1es> My fingers kind of automatically wrote it
[07:06:36] <pachet> cook1es: http://jsfiddle.net/UKZCp/2/
[07:06:54] <pachet> or something similar
[07:07:00] <pachet> probably a more elegant solution
[07:07:41] <cook1es> that code returns error: elem.parent is not a function
[07:07:51] <Ankabout> how do I make sure that insertBefore() only happens for the first occurence of the matched element?
[07:08:02] <codecab> Hello guys, im trying to set a default value on an input field used for a jQuery UI datepicker... but if i set the value HTML attribute, the input field is empty
[07:08:51] <codecab> jQuery UI datepicker default value, how? :)
[07:09:50] <jinxdone2> ateam: looks like offset.top is returning an offset relative to the viewport, not from the top of the list
[07:10:36] <ateam> jinxdone2: what ? ;) how to change that, you mean from the window not from the div
[07:10:59] <jinxdone2> I was just looking at it at the debugger
[07:11:20] <jinxdone2> if you scroll down the list and then hit some value that is above the current scroll position offset.top has a negative value
[07:12:49] <seutje> ?eq @ Ankabout
[07:13:01] <Ankabout> ahh wait I found it
[07:13:03] <Ankabout> :first :)
[07:13:13] <seutje> bot?
[07:13:29] <ateam> jinxdone2: mhh
[07:13:31] <jinxdone2> ateam; so in essence you should do something like $('#soso').animate({scrollTop: $('#soso').scrollTop() - top}, 'slow');
[07:13:39] <jinxdone2> that ought to fix it
[07:17:59] <ccmonster> anyone used the jquery ui menu?
[07:18:10] <Guest42450> http://jsfiddle.net/M6PJq/1/
[07:18:15] <jinxdone2> err.. make that $('#soso).scrollTop +top not - top.. you want to add the value not substract :)

[07:30:25] <cole_gillespie> like in vim
[07:32:01] <ateam> jinxdone2: offset is 0 ?
[07:32:15] <ateam> ah top i mean
[07:33:40] <feathersanddown> can someone enter here ? : https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js  i get a 404 error
[07:33:48] <ccmonster> anyone have any experience with the jquery ui menu?
[07:34:06] <ccmonster> i use to use gedit, when I was on NIX at work . I miss it :|
[07:34:15] <ccmonster> or geany.
[07:39:07] <Ankabout> why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/6jygm/1/
[07:39:18] <Ankabout> it expands when I click, but it doesn't contract when I click again
[07:42:19] <ateam785> jinxdone2: how you got the negative output ?
[07:42:31] <quicksilver> Ankabout: because there aren't things in that class when you bind it.
[07:42:53] <Ankabout> quicksilver?
[07:43:01] <quicksilver> Ankabout: at document ready time, $(".opening-title.closed") matches one item, but  $(".opening-title.open") matches none
[07:43:10] <quicksilver> so that second bit of code doesn't actually get bound to anything
[07:43:17] <Ankabout> ahhhhh
[07:43:18] <Ankabout> of course
[07:43:32] <quicksilver> I would just bind one bit of code to $(.opening-title)
[07:43:41] <quicksilver> and make it determine whether or not it's currently open
[07:43:57] <quicksilver> if ($(this).hasClass("open")) { .... } else { ... }
[07:44:05] <Ankabout> thanks!!!
[07:44:10] <Ankabout> stupid me, so obvious haha
[07:44:18] <quicksilver> there are a few special purpose toggle things but this is a general way.
[07:44:30] <Merimac> Ankabout you can also use toggle()
[07:46:32] <Ankabout> Merimac, how would you change that script to toggle then?
[07:46:48] <Ankabout> I tried to see using the docs, but I can't figure out where I'd specify the target hiehgts
[07:46:51] <Ankabout> heights*
[07:46:51] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, I got it working. Apparntly the code that was generating the element names had a " " hidden somewhere nasty.
[07:47:03] <aaronmcadam> spoooooky
[07:48:34] <Merbster> aaronmcadam, your debugging tip helped alot. So again, thanks
[07:48:47] <aaronmcadam> ur very welcome

[08:14:26] <Merimac> back from coffee break :D
[08:15:39] <Merimac> nobody as answer, to run an AfterOpen event in jQuery UI dialog
[08:17:34] <erichynds> Merimac: open fires after the dialog has opened
[08:19:21] <niels__> anyone familiar with the highcharts lib?
[08:19:55] <Merimac> erichynds : I'm not sure about that !
[08:20:23] <Merimac> erichynds : http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ !
[08:20:55] <erichynds> Merimac: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L327
[08:21:03] <erichynds> triggering the open event is the last thing the open() method does
[08:21:08] <fiz_> hey guys I am using Datepicker and I need an event for when the dtae changes periond not just onChangeMonthYear how can i do this? ive tried using .change() on the input field but it doesnt trigger...
[08:21:52] <erichynds> Merimac: if you're using animations to open the dialog, then it could fire before
[08:29:09] <aibo> hi
[08:29:48] <beppu> hello
[08:29:57] <aibo> i'm trying to use the viewport selector plugin (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport)
[08:30:26] <aibo> in the demo they use some sort of $('div:in-viewport').each() ....
[08:30:53] <aibo> if it's possible to use each() on the array, why do i get an error using .last( ?)
[08:32:28] <aibo> i allways get "$('div:in-viewport').last() ist not a function"
[08:32:41] <beppu> that's strange.
[08:34:11] <Merimac> erichynds : the bug I have is visible on : http://mo.by/apc  when you open the see availability, close
[08:34:24] <Merimac> to the image
[08:35:50] <Merimac> erichynds : popin add blank under footer, and more scroll, So I want to remove it my runing an auto height on my div overlay
[08:36:09] <erichynds> wat
[08:36:20] <erichynds> ?reduce @ Merimac
[08:36:26] <erichynds> meh
[08:37:02] <aibo> beppu: any ideas?
[08:38:07] <Merimac> erichynds : my popin, add this height on the height of the overlay
[08:38:09] <beppu> aibo: I've been playing around with last() in the chrome console.  On that particular page, you can't even do $('div').last()
[08:38:18] <beppu> It's as if last() doesn't work on that page.
[08:38:34] <beppu> And I found out why.
[08:38:39] <erichynds> Merimac: i'm sorry, I just have no idea what you're talking about
[08:38:46] <beppu> jQuery.fn.jquery == "1.3.1"
[08:38:59] <beppu> the version of jquery they're using doesn't have the last() method.
[08:39:04] <Merimac> erichynds : ok
[08:41:57] <aibo> GAAAH!
[08:42:03] <aibo> thank you so much!
[08:42:10] <beppu> sure.
[08:42:16] <beppu> sometimes it's something little like that.
[08:43:14] <beppu> aibo:  jQuery.getScript('https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.3/jquery.min.js', function(){ jQuery.noConflict() })
[08:44:54] <aibo> really thank you so much!
[08:45:19] <beppu> aibo: good luck. i gotta go to work now.
[08:46:18] <beppu> aibo:  one last thing.....
[08:46:19] <beppu> jQuery.getScript('https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.3/jquery.min.js', function(){ jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery.getScript('http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport/jquery.viewport.js'); })
[08:46:26] <beppu> jQuery('img:in-viewport').last()
[08:46:51] <beppu> aibo:  $ will have the old jQuery 1.3.1;  jQuery will be the new 1.6.3
[08:47:36] <aibo> okay so it won't work anyways?
[08:48:18] <beppu> After you run that in the console, you should be able to use the last() method and have access to the in-viewport selector.
[08:48:36] <beppu> This is all intended to run on http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport/3x2.html
[08:48:51] <beppu> I assumed that was the page you were looking at.
[08:50:23] <aibo> mhm
[08:50:39] <aibo> doesn't work quite right yet, but i will figure thatout
[08:51:28] <beppu> good luck
[08:53:21] <aibo> thank you
[08:54:03] <aibo> $('article:in-viewport').first().css({background:"red"}) <- doesn't work
[09:00:02] <jbrokc> how do I wrap a  comma separated list of selectors in a new element? $("#foo, .bar").wrap("#newfoo") ?
[09:00:46] <jbrokc> it's $.before!
[09:04:07] <ccmonster> what sort of element is foo?
[09:04:17] <ccmonster> jbrokc, ?
[09:04:38] <ccmonster> you can do $('#foo,.bar').wrap($('#newfoo')); i believe
[09:05:20] <ccmonster> or, if you it's not an dom obj yet, .wrap($('<div></div>',{id:'newfoo'})
[09:06:13] <Jobbe> hi
[09:06:44] <aibo> hi
[09:07:27] <ccmonster> hi
[09:07:32] <tonyjcamp> oh hai
[09:07:33] <jbrokc> ccmonster: what's the object argument to the jquery object in .wrap($('<div></div>,{id:'newfoo'})) ?
[09:07:52] <ccmonster> what do you mean?
[09:08:01] <jbrokc> ccmonster: and I had no idea .wrap() was actually a function - I was just kinda bullshitting about what I wanted to do and was already down the path of $.before.prepend
[09:08:13] <jbrokc> ccmonster: Uhh… I don't understand what that second object is doing in the jquery object argument
[09:08:33] <ccmonster> the second one allows you to add attributes to the object you want to have wrap
[09:08:45] <jbrokc> ccmonster: oh cool - is there a doc page I can look that up at?
[09:09:16] <ccmonster>  .wrap($('<div></div>',{id:'newfoo','class':'aclassname',name:'aname','data-id':'1234'})
[09:10:06] <jbrokc> ccmonster: is there a doc page for having the second argument to $() be an object of defined properties?
[09:10:24] <Jobbe> http://mobil.partyzone.nu/devtest/ - I wrote about this yesterday - having some problems with Jplayer, can't get it working on other devices than my iPhone
[09:10:30] <Brodingo> ?g jquery element creation
[09:10:44] <Brodingo> >:|
[09:11:01] <Jobbe> found out i should have a crossdomain.xml file on the server, which is on the server i use for streaming
[09:11:02] <jbrokc> hahah, unsatisfied frog smiley
[09:11:28] <ccmonster> http://thenerdary.net/articles/entry/beautiful_element_creation_with_jquery
[09:11:46] <ccmonster> i cant find the normal doc page, but there is some nice step through on it
[09:11:49] <ccmonster> should get you started.
[09:14:15] <aibo> http://stuff.nr79.de/scroll/comb.html#Webdesign can someon tell me, why this little piece of code makes my cpu go crazy?
[09:14:34] <djQuery> is there a form change event. ie where the change of an input inside the form changes does it bubble to the form?
[09:15:36] <peppux> hello
[09:15:46] <ccmonster> im not sure if there if propagation or not.
[09:15:56] <ccmonster> hello peppux
[09:16:02] <peppux> hello ccmonster
[09:16:07] <aibo> djQuery: u mean like onClick and onblur?
[09:16:35] <djQuery> yes but will just use delegates now that I think of it
[09:16:50] <djQuery> aibo: ^^
[09:17:34] <aibo> :D
[09:17:57] <peppux> can i modify the text in <li></li> with jquery ?
[09:18:08] <aibo> yap
[09:18:21] <aibo> $(li).text()
[09:18:54] <aibo> peppux: http://api.jquery.com/text/
[09:19:19] <peppux> hm, if i want insert a text input in the <li>?
[09:19:54] <Segaja> $(li).html('<input ... />');
[09:20:14] <dabear> djQuery: change events bubbles, so you can listen for change on the form if you want
[09:20:25] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/gm2Ac/
[09:20:48] <dabear> they don't actually bubble, but jquery makes it happen anyway ;)
[09:23:09] <aibo> no ideads on the cpu-usage-issues?
[09:23:16] <aibo> and the disabled scrolling
[09:23:33] <aibo> opera messes it up badly too...
[09:23:34] <aibo> :(
[09:23:49] <mick`> Hi, how can i keep the subnavigation open?? http://jsfiddle.net/DqbGZ/1/
[09:24:37] <jasonrsmith> howdy.  How do I disable clicking until animations are complete?
[09:25:10] <Luyt> Something strange. My jQuery/jQueryUI works when Firebug is active and enabled, and stops working when it's not. Any ideas?
[09:26:23] <danzik171> dabear: That's still some voodoo I don't fully comprehend (how exactly it's accomplishing the bubbling).  I know it's happening in jquery.event.special, but damn.
[09:28:03] <dabear> danzik171: it listens to blur, click etc events on the elements
[09:28:08] <pachet> aibo: one of your events is firing a function continuously, probably because of conflicting namespaces for the associated binding
[09:28:30] <dabear> and then trigger manully the handlers to the change event
[09:30:27] <aibo> pachet: but what could it be?
[09:30:53] <aibo> pachet: the only event i use is the scroll-event and that's not trigered all the time
[09:32:28] <Connor_> Sup
[09:33:08] <pachet> aibo: not sure, throw some log()'s on the likely suspects and see who's firing when
[09:34:42] <aibo> pachet: thank you, i'll try it
[09:36:35] <danzik171> dabear: Sure, and on submitBubbles I can understand that since it's calling .closest() to get the bubbling going it looks like, but for changeBubbles it looks like it's triggering a custom jquery event (which then handles bubbling through normal patterns)?  Looking at the src at the moment
[09:37:12] <dabear> danzik171: I havent really investigated this at all
[09:38:00] <danzik171> dabear: Fair enough - still working on comprehending the source enough to the point where I can actually submit useful patches :)
[09:39:50] <SinnerNyx> when I hide an element inside a div(id='container'), $('#container').width() returns zero. why?
[09:42:59] <donCams> coz it's hidden? :)
[09:43:16] <SinnerNyx> one of it's content elements are hidden. it in itself is not
[09:43:27] <pachet> SinnerNyx: set the parent's width explicitly
[09:43:46] <donCams> coz the child is hidden, parent do not get child's width
[09:47:11] <SinnerNyx> donCams, it still has other children...
[09:47:41] <SinnerNyx> pachet, I'm trying to figure out the width of the element to dynamically center it vertically and horizontally
[09:48:16] <pachet> can you put it in a jsfiddle?
[09:48:21] <dabear> mick`: should be possible to say if neither subnav or .navigation has mouse focus, close subnav
[09:49:05] <SinnerNyx> yep., but I just put in a workaround. I'll try to replicate my issue on jsfiddle, and bring it to your attention in a few mins
[09:50:03] <NielsNL> hello can someone please help me transform the next line, so that when there is no optgroup it shows only the  $o.html() ?    $o.parents('optgroup').attr('label') + "&nbsp;>&nbsp;" + $o.html();
[09:52:03] <Connor_> @NielsNL do you want to check if the optgroup exists and if it dosen't do something?
[09:52:35] <Connor_> dosen't, do something*
[09:53:32] <NielsNL> yeah
[09:54:17] <Connor_> if($(yourelement).length)
[09:54:20] <Connor_> Will see if an element exists
[09:55:34] <NielsNL> so it should be if($($o.parents('optgroup')).length) ?
[09:56:04] <Connor_> I believe so
[09:56:40] <dabear> mick`: seems to work, allthough I don't quite understand why it does: http://jsfiddle.net/DqbGZ/3/
[09:56:41] <dabear> :p
[09:58:06] <Connor_> @dabear, you ususaly would build a dropdown menu like so:
[09:58:14] <Connor_> ul > li > ul > li li li li etc
[09:58:24] <Connor_> So that you only check when you enter/exit the first ul
[09:58:40] <Connor_> But there is many ways :P
[09:58:44] <Connor_> I just find that way to be easiest
[09:59:10] <dabear> I just fixed his code
[09:59:26] <Connor_> Ah kai
[09:59:28] <djQuery> I am building a plugin that stores and retrieves form data to html5 datastorage. it appears that I will need to stringify the form before adding it to storage. Simple enough just do form.serialize
[09:59:38] <djQuery> is there a corresponding .parse
[09:59:40] <dabear> not my problem really :p
[09:59:58] <djQuery> ?.parse
[10:00:00] <dabear> djQuery: jsonify it?
[10:01:33] <djQuery> dabear: instead of storing each input as a seperate entry I was just going to grab the form id + form name and store the .serialized form in the .setItem(form.id + form.name, $(form).serialize);
[10:01:57] <Connor_> ?eval 224 / 7
[10:02:00] <djQuery> dabear: to load the forms data outa storage how would I parse the seriaized dta back
[10:02:12] <Connor_> The bot is dead :(
[10:02:23] <NielsNL> Connor_: this works fine thanks
[10:02:34] <Connor_> Np
[10:02:46] <SinnerNyx> ok, i'm trying to figure out why this behaviour occurs: http://jsfiddle.net/6MhBD/
[10:03:00] <SinnerNyx> click on the thumbnail and the picture shows up centered
[10:03:07] <djQuery> dabear: I know I could do JSON.parse(   but was hoping not to have a dependency ont eh json2
[10:03:09] <dabear> djQuery: if something seems not possible with jquery, it is, and ben_alman has a plugin for it
[10:03:11] <SinnerNyx> click on it again and the picture's div is 0x0
[10:03:26] <SinnerNyx> if I remove the line cimg.hide(), it works correctly
[10:04:05] <dabear> djQuery: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[10:05:09] <SinnerNyx> debugging it, i noticed that vp.width() gives zero when cimg.hide() occurs, but i don't know why
[10:05:16] <djQuery> dabear: seems like jQuery.parseJSON might do what I need
[10:05:43] <Connor_> @What's the issue SinnerNyx
[10:05:49] <Connor_> That it changes to 0x0?
[10:05:59] <dabear> djQuery: breakign news: there exists plugins that does what you try to accomplish
[10:06:13] <dabear> why re-invent the wheel?
[10:06:18] <SinnerNyx> Connor_: yes
[10:06:42] <djQuery> dabear: beacuse googling for it didnt turn it up
[10:07:08] <Connor_> SinnerNyx, which div goes 0x0? The image or viewport?
[10:07:16] <SinnerNyx> the viewport
[10:07:23] <djQuery> dabear: there is most likely a plugin for jsut about anything you want to do
[10:07:30] * djQuery :)
[10:07:31] <SinnerNyx> i am using the latest chrome. maybe it's a chrome quirk?
[10:07:38] <Connor_> Viewport dosen't have any width or height set so it will go to 0x0
[10:07:52] <SinnerNyx> why does it have a height/width the first time?
[10:08:23] <Connor_> It only has the width/height of the word Loading...
[10:08:31] <Connor_> Its width/height are auto
[10:08:35] <dabear> djQuery: http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/jstorage-html5-local-storage-for-prototype-mootools-and-jquery/
[10:08:49] <dabear> maybe nto quite what you were after though
[10:08:49] <pootpoot> anyone know if theres a way to detect if a scroll event is from the user moving the scrollbar/wheel or from code window.scroll animate ?
[10:08:59] <SinnerNyx> Connor_: incorrect. I remove loading prior to the width() call, and insert and image. the .width() call then gives the widht of the image+2 (for the viewport border)
[10:09:21] <SinnerNyx> otherwise the image would not be centered in the 'top' div
[10:10:04] <Connor_> Wait, you are hiding the viewport
[10:10:11] <Connor_> So height/width will be set to 0
[10:10:16] <Connor_> IIRC
[10:10:29] <SinnerNyx> Connor_: again, the issue becomes, why isn't height/width 0 the first time then?
[10:10:43] <SinnerNyx> i hide the viewport the first time too
[10:11:00] <SinnerNyx> alternatively if i can get the width/height from the image object I can use that instead. $(new Image()).width() always returns 0 for some reason..
[10:11:11] <SinnerNyx> erm
[10:11:21] <SinnerNyx> replace new image() with an image that has it's src set and is loaded
[10:11:47] <mick`> dabear, thank you that works very good.. now i just have to understand what you did :) thank you!!
[10:12:10] <Connor_> Sec, just looking
[10:12:10] <dabear> mick`: that shouldn't work, but it does
[10:12:21] <dabear> most likely conclusion: I don't understand it my self
[10:13:10] <Connor_> @SinnerNyx it seems to log the right width/height values for me
[10:13:26] <SinnerNyx> really? so the div doesn't disappear for you?
[10:13:34] <Connor_> No?
[10:13:41] <SinnerNyx> perhaps its a chrome quirk. are you using chrome?
[10:13:46] <mick`> lol
[10:13:48] <Connor_> If I click the thumbnail twice nothing happyns
[10:13:49] <Connor_> And yes
[10:14:03] <SinnerNyx> did you change the code at all?
[10:14:19] <Connor_> Only add console.log()
[10:14:47] <dabear> mick`: update, you don't need the if check: http://jsfiddle.net/DqbGZ/4/ . seems the last func is only called when both elems have lost hover state
[10:14:48] <Connor_> Wait wait
[10:14:49] <Connor_> I did :P
[10:15:14] <SinnerNyx> Connor_ lol. so are you getting the issue when you revert to my code?
[10:15:24] <Connor_> Yeah, I got rid of the hide()
[10:15:37] <Connor_> So when the hide() runs, you then get 0x0 on the viewport?
[10:15:49] <SinnerNyx> ic. yep, like i said, when the hide isn't there, the issue disappears. the question is why?
[10:16:05] <SinnerNyx> yep
[10:16:11] <djQuery> dabear: thanks but that is just a plugin for storing stuff to localStorage not for actualy loading data from storage and populating the form.
[10:17:01] <Connor_> Ah I got the problem now
[10:17:03] <Connor_> I shall investigate
[10:17:22] <SinnerNyx> Connor_ thank you :).
[10:17:58] <Connor_> It seems to me, that the first time you click the image, the viewport automaticaly goes to the width/height, when you click it again, it removes/hides the image so the viewport is now 0x0
[10:18:25] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/6MhBD/3/
[10:18:57] <Connor_> Now returns 500x500 both times
[10:19:04] <Connor_> Because viewport has a fixed width/height
[10:19:14] <Connor_> It is doing what it is suppoed to at the moment
[10:20:01] <SinnerNyx> Connor_ the link you sent me is still going to 0x0
[10:20:25] <Connor_> How do you see if it is going to 0x0, by the console?
[10:20:35] <Connor_> Or how are you shall I say
[10:20:45] <SinnerNyx> no. the image disappears from view
[10:21:04] <Connor_> That dosen't mean it goes to 0x0
[10:21:12] <SinnerNyx> ok hang on i'll check
[10:21:12] <Connor_> That means the image is now hidden
[10:21:23] <Connor_> Or display:none; specifically
[10:21:47] <Connor_> If you still want to get the width/height of the image then use visibility:hidden; instead
[10:22:14] <SinnerNyx> omg... i think i see the issue. let me check
[10:22:30] <Connor_> ?eval 224/7
[10:22:30] <bot-t> Connor_: 32

[10:22:46] <bot-t> Connor_: 4.6000000000000005
[10:23:42] <SinnerNyx> Connor_ the issue i was having was when I did cimg.hide(), it hid the image element, and when I did cimg.remove(). when I try to reinsert the image i reinsert the hidden image
[10:24:05] <SinnerNyx> so i fixed it by doing(cimg.hide();cimg.remove();cimg.show();)
[10:24:22] <SinnerNyx> thx for the help Conor_ ^^
[10:24:36] <Connor_> Np. Though, why do you need to hide/remvoe it if you are just going to show it again :P
[10:25:08] <Connor_> If you want to check if is visible or not just do
[10:25:21] <SinnerNyx> Connor_ I will have more pictures in the production. this will switch out the pictures. the .show will allow me to reinsert the image if it is reselected
[10:26:37] <Connor_> Fair enough
[10:27:51] <Connor_> How can I get the most common value in an array?
[10:30:24] <enjoycrf> dang this like a super popular room
[10:34:55] <ccmonster> jquery is super popular :)
[10:36:32] <Brodingo> wtf is jquery

[10:40:32] <phrearch> hm, wonder how to implement custom context menus for all parts of a cms properly
[10:40:57] <phrearch> like if you rclick in a module, say a blog, it should account for clicking on an article or not(showing article specific actions)
[10:41:02] <Connor_> Question, if the browser sets a css property by default, how do I access it
[10:41:08] <Connor_> Say, the default position attribute is static
[10:41:12] <Connor_> How would I test that?
[10:41:23] <Connor_> Atm I have $(ele).css('position') == 'static'
[10:41:28] <Connor_> Would I use attr()?
[10:41:34] <gnarf> $("<div>").css('position')
[10:41:45] <Connor_> Thanks
[10:43:31] <Connor_> Another question, I am building a plugin, I need to position some elements off the screen, however I have only taken into consideration left to right layouts
[10:43:36] <Connor_> How would I support right to left
[10:43:56] <dabear> the question is why you need to do that
[10:44:04] <dabear> why not detach the elemetns instead?
[10:44:07] <dabear> see ?detach
[10:44:08] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[10:44:30] <dabear> and you can reinsert them again, Connor_
[10:44:34] <Connor_> Even if I detatched elements, I still need to put them all in at one point
[10:44:36] <dabear> with append() etc
[10:44:47] <Connor_> So I need somewhere outside the div, to hold them and then animate them into the div
[10:44:49] <dabear> detach is then better
[10:45:00] <dabear> hmm
[10:45:09] <Connor_> Adding the elements back in would cause a reflow
[10:45:24] <Connor_> Which I want to avoid if poss
[10:46:03] <Induane> I am workong with jqueryui tabs, is there a way to make the tabs function within the confines of a container div?
[10:46:17] <Induane> due to necessity, each tab is its own page
[10:46:43] <Induane> but when I use the tab interface, when I change tabs it downloads the whole page including stuff outside the container divider
[10:46:47] <Induane> div*
[10:47:51] <Induane> so I end up with this: http://imagebin.org/172446
[10:55:09] <Connor_> Question on jQuery objects.
[10:55:13] <Connor_> Why can't I do this: http://jsfiddle.net/zZkfs/
[10:55:31] <Connor_> Access an objects property value to use a property key, from another object?
[10:57:21] <skiy1337> I've just written a piece of software. If you have an FTP server, it let's you store you documents on it.

[11:01:10] <Connor_> Hi
[11:06:20] <phrearch> ehm, i have a delegate on an element, but when i do a contextmenu click on an inner element, how can i make sure it catches the data-trigger attribute in http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476006/  ? the click delegate is on blog-context
[11:06:37] <danzik171> Connor_: http://jsfiddle.net/zZkfs/1/
[11:07:01] <Connor_> ooo
[11:07:08] <Connor_> Amazing
[11:07:25] <Connor_> Thanks! Why can't you do it in the {}?
[11:07:59] <danzik171> Connor_: Just doesn't work like that.  If you want to use a literal string, you need to use bracket notation
[11:08:15] <Connor_> I see. Well thanks, gonna help alot! :D
[11:13:16] <annymouse> hear me?
[11:13:52] <annymouse> i have a very long text, how can i with div tags and css put auto line breaking in it please?
[11:15:21] <annymouse> http://pastebin.com/QrByRQrT
[11:15:35] <cronin> any reason why .each() or .addClass() would not work in IE7?
[11:15:35] <annymouse> how can i do so that the long text would be splitted by itself on the page?
[11:15:49] <annymouse> by a css param
[11:15:51] <dabear> annymouse: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/long-text
[11:15:57] <dabear> or do it server side
[11:16:11] <dabear> e.g. add the zero width space from php
[11:16:14] <annymouse> there are no css only solutions?
[11:16:28] <annymouse> i mean a replacment for <br> but automatically
[11:16:29] <wreel> just a div with a width set and wrapping turned on would do it
[11:16:30] <eddiemonge> cronin: because you have an error somewhere?
[11:16:37] <annymouse> can i have an example please
[11:16:58] <annymouse> of a style property
[11:17:24] <cronin> eddiemonge: hmm, it works in IE 8, and 9. I don't see any errors either.
[11:17:33] <eddiemonge> code?
[11:17:44] <Connor_> I have a question more about usability than anything. I have a jQuery plugin, it REQUIRES the user to use window(load) for it work (Working with image sizes etc, and $('img').load() isn't reliable). do you think that would be okay
[11:17:46] <phrearch> is it possible to check all child elements of a delegate for a data attribute somehow?
[11:17:52] <wreel> annymouse: i don't know which one is correct but margin-right would work in some cases
[11:19:21] <cronin> oh wait, it's not a jquery issue, my bad
[11:20:49] <eddiemonge> phrearch: of a delegate? do you mean check all child elements of an element?
[11:21:09] <eddiemonge> Connor_: not doc ready()?
[11:22:23] <phrearch> eddiemonge: ehm, its more like i have a delegate thats set on a parent element, while i need a reference to the actual clicked element inside the delegate
[11:22:32] <Connor_> @eddiemonge, doc.ready won't work, it just returns 0 with width()
[11:23:21] <phrearch> delegate is on blog-context, while i would like to check if blog-article has a data-trigger when clicked on: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476016/
[11:23:59] <eddiemonge> Connor_: what are you trying to do?
[11:24:23] <Connor_> Get the width of an image (or any element they choose, but primarily images) that dosen't have any css or attributes set
[11:25:02] <eddiemonge> Connor_: .width() should work
[11:25:22] <Connor_> Width does work but only on window.load, lemme see if I can get a jsfiddle up
[11:26:29] <phrearch> i suppose i want to have an event handler that catches both the parent and the containing target child element thats clicked on
[11:27:02] <Connor_> @eddiemonge http://jsfiddle.net/fAwFJ/
[11:27:04] <Connor_> Vs http://jsfiddle.net/fAwFJ/1/
[11:27:16] <eddiemonge> phrearch: you mean like event bubbling (propagation)?
[11:27:20] <Connor_> First is domReady, second is window.load
[11:29:00] <phrearch> eddiemonge: yea i suppose
[11:29:51] <eddiemonge> phrearch: then that should be happening by default as long as you dont use e.stopPropagation()
[11:32:02] <eddiemonge> Connor_: and you cant do this: http://jsfiddle.net/fAwFJ/2/
[11:32:02] <dlyneswork> Does jquery allow me to update an image's content on the fly?
[11:33:22] <dlyneswork> Or is it really only useful for obtaining textual content?
[11:34:00] <sean`> dlyneswork, $('img').attr ('src', 'new src'
[11:35:48] <dlyneswork> sean`, so something like $('img').attr ('src', '/cgi-bin/getNewImage.cgi?width=100&height=100&format=jpeg&lat=83.0&lon=-111.83')?
[11:35:59] <sean`> yeah bro
[11:36:05] <dlyneswork> sean`, ah...ok...thanks
[11:43:54] <MetaJake> might anyone mind taking a look at these 7 lines of jquery http://dpaste.com/614980/ and recommend me a technique to successfully write lines 4-6 ?
[11:45:45] <gkatsev> MetaJake: use the ternary op (?:)   (test ? true expression : false expression)
[11:46:26] <MetaJake> gkatsev I will look into that as an option, thanks
[11:47:20] <eddiemonge> MetaJake: http://dpaste.com/614981/
[11:54:59] <minijupe> i have input image that submits my form. i have registered a click event to handle the form via js, but want it to fall back to standard submission. I cannot seem to prevent the form submission in Firefox by returning false from the click function. This works in Chrome and Safari however. What am I doing wrong?
[11:56:35] <eddiemonge> minijupe: first, you really should probably be using e.preventDefault() and are you doing this on the form or on the img button?
[11:56:50] <Rushing> is there a way to listen to all events on an element?
[11:57:21] <minijupe> eddiemonge: the click event is on the img button.
[11:58:50] <mbtez> hi...what is the best way to send a request to server corresponding to a single ID, and then get a response back that allows me to set multiple variables based on that response?  i am aware of jQuery.get()
[11:59:18] <mbtez> i'm sure there is some convention to do this... JSON?
[11:59:36] <mbtez> then the question is how
[11:59:50] <sphinxxx> if i have a bit of a lag on submit (it takes a while for the server to process), can I show an animated gif on submit, or will it not show?
[12:00:05] <mbtez> yes sphinxxx of course
[12:00:13] <minijupe> eddiemonge: maybe I should be setting the submit function of the form instead of the click funciton of the button?
[12:00:15] <mbtez> just inject it into the HTML when you click the submit button
[12:01:01] <sphinxxx> inject it, or is it better/faster to have it already loaded, and just show it?
[12:01:15] <mbtez> same difference
[12:01:37] <mbtez> just throw <img src="foobar.gif" style="width:0;height:0;"> somewhere on your page
[12:01:38] <danagin> I have a div I'm popping over. This div is for detailed information on an item clicked. I would like for the popover to take 95% of the viewable DOM, but not loose the users scroll place when they click out of the popover. I can't use position absolute due to the iphone not supporting it.
[12:01:53] <wreel> mbtez: .get, .post or .ajax would work for that. json back from teh server gets parsed correctly and handed to your success callback, although i don't know if other formats also work
[12:01:56] <danagin> any ideas?
[12:02:17] <wreel> so far i have only used .post but it was pretty easy
[12:02:32] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[12:02:53] <mbtez> that's amazing
[12:02:55] <mbtez> lol
[12:03:55] <danagin> sorry, I can't use position fixed
[12:08:26] <sphinxxx> is .getJSON the same as doing .ajax with dataType json ?
[12:08:33] <wreel> i think so
[12:08:54] <wreel> even without dataType set on the other calls, it does an intelligent guess and could end up as json anyway
[12:12:09] <jaequery> anyone here use mootools?
[12:12:43] <PrgmrBill> anyone knowledgable about the checkbox/same name issue with jquerymobile
[12:13:48] <elben> Say I build an html = $("<div …>…</div>");. How would I manipulate elements in html using the jquery selector? That is, I want something like html.selectElements(".my-class").append(…)
[12:14:45] <sphinxxx> i see that "feedback" bar fixed to the left side of many websites, is that a plugin of some sort?
[12:19:12] <danagin> is there a way to say top of the viewable window as oposed to top of page?
[12:19:13] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[12:19:21] <ProLoser|Work> is there an easy way to generate an array of a numerical range?
[12:19:24] <PrgmrBill> that's called the viewport, danagin
[12:21:00] <MetaJake> eddiemonge, your solution ( http://dpaste.com/614981/ )to my ternary challenge worked somewhat, but instead of just concatenating another <li> to the list, it  removed the rest of the list items and only returned the doula.phone2 as a list item. Might you suggest what I can do further, to get doula.phone2 to render as an additional List Item in my list?
[12:21:54] <eddiemonge> MetaJake: use jsfiddle.net as that should work
[12:22:07] <MetaJake> I will give that a try, thank you.
[12:22:24] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: look at the code. its just an absolutely positioned element that slides open usually
[12:22:34] <eddiemonge> PrgmrBill: the what?
[12:22:55] <PrgmrBill> eddiemonge: I'm experiencing a weird bug where checkboxes with the same name will check all three
[12:23:21] <PrgmrBill> I've googled it quite a bit and it seems to be a confirmed bug, but I see no solutions or workarounds
[12:23:41] <eddiemonge> PrgmrBill: ask in #jquerymobile and file a bug at github
[12:23:47] <eddiemonge> with test cases
[12:24:10] <ProLoser|Work> is there a better/more efficient alternative to this? http://pastebin.com/gk7sxXsd
[12:25:31] <PrgmrBill> there are already open bugs for it, I think. thanks anyway
[12:27:35] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: you are just creating an array of numbers between start and end?
[12:28:04] <b1lly> if i have a set interval loop
[12:28:19] <danagin> yeah, I know it's the viewport, but that still doesn't tell me which property to set to get the viewport top.
[12:28:20] <b1lly> can i have an external listener if triggered to reset the count of the interval loop ?
[12:28:40] <b1lly> like for example if the setinterval is 1000 secs long
[12:28:41] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/7j7y6/
[12:28:53] <b1lly> and its 500 secs in, and someone clicks something, it resets the interval to 0 so it counts for 1000 again
[12:29:23] <ProLoser|Work> i was just curious if there was a native js/jq fn for this
[12:31:12] <danagin> is there a property for viewport top?
[12:31:18] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: other than what i put?
[12:33:50] <MoTiOnXml> jeez, that cookie-issue with flash almost got me
[12:36:38] <srj55> can anyone point me to a better plugin than this:  http://fstoke.me/jquery/window/      I need a window dialog with min/max/resize functionality
[12:36:48] <danagin> I can't use position:fixed...
[12:38:01] <ProLoser|Work> eddiemonge: what you put is fine
[12:39:20] <eddiemonge> srj55: like jqueryui's dialog?
[12:39:50] <srj55> eddiemonge:  sort of.  but with max/min button  and ability to load iframe into the box
[12:40:55] <srj55> edditmonge:  like this http://windoo.110mb.com/template/windoo.html
[12:41:30] <aple> How do I delay a function from firing? I'm trying to have a Fancybox popup 5 seconds into a page. $.delay.fancybox() doesn't do anything though.
[12:41:44] <eddiemonge> aple: setTimeout()
[12:45:32] <aple> Thanks eddie. I seem to remember going over setTimeout several times before. Maybe I'll learn it this time. :)
[12:45:37] <aple> *actually learn it
[12:46:25] <eddiemonge> aple: its pure javascript that you should know.
[12:53:06] <aple> I mean, to me, it makes sense in theory, but every time I try to put it into practice, it breaks. I don't work with it enough to thoroughly "know" it, but when something comes up, I really try to learn it. :(
[12:53:13] <aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476068/ doesn't work.
[12:53:25] <aple> "missing ) after argument list	        }); "
[12:54:02] <aca20031> If I want to run some javascript as soon as an arbitrary element is loaded, is there an event for that. Something like onLoad="foo(this)" but I guess onLoad doesnt work for elements like div
[12:54:50] <eddiemonge> aca20031: why cant you use .ready() (not for the elements but for the document itself)
[12:55:26] <aca20031> well I want to make like 40 things into progress bars, so I want to be able to do something like onLoad(foO(this)) funciton foo(x) { x.progressbar(); }
[12:55:48] <aca20031> or something, something better than making them all #progressN and looping through them all
[12:55:55] <aca20031> especially since they depend on a PHP variable at the time of being written
[12:57:09] <aca20031> onLoad="function () { $(this).progressbar(value:<?php echo($v); ?>); }"
[12:57:12] <aca20031> thats the idea
[12:59:43] <notbenh1> hello all, I've got a webservice that returns HTML that I'm hoping that I can just use jquery to slap in the right place in the dom, I thought that I would use $.ajax though that seems strticly tied to XML/JSON. Is there another way to effectivly do: $.('div#here').html( $.remote_call('/content/here'))
[13:00:08] <starsinmypockets> Folks know where to find a netflix-style jquery slider, that shows a row of images that slide to the left / right when you hover over the arrows...
[13:00:31] <Haprog_> notbenh1: use .load() on the dom
[13:00:47] <notbenh1> Haprog_: ahh thanks
[13:01:07] <starsinmypockets> notbenh1 - I'm not an expert but I think that ajax can load any sort of rendered output, not just xml json...
[13:01:37] <starsinmypockets> ..so you could use ...load('/your/stuff')
[13:02:21] <starsinmypockets> (oh - Haprog_ just said that *smirk*)
[13:02:27] <Haprog_> ^^
[13:02:41] <eddiemonge> aca20031: how are you turning them into progress bars? with a plugin?
[13:02:45] <notbenh1> starsinmypockets: ya it looks like load is exactly what I was looking for (thanks again Haprog_)
[13:04:46] <eddiemonge> notbenh1: but yes, ajax can handle pretty much any data type
[13:04:46] <Brodingo> awesome
[13:04:48] <amoore> zaaaa!

[13:05:39] <Jobbe> hha
[13:05:40] <panfist> is there any way to clean up the following selector? i'm trying to work my way through some ugly nested framse http://dpaste.com/615030/
[13:06:22] <starsinmypockets> Umm - are we under attack?
[13:06:36] <almsy> googletorp: are you available to give me a quick hand? I'm trying to pull the order total from calculate_quote in the example flat rate plugin
[13:06:58] <ravenzz> 9/14
[13:07:22] <panfist> is there any way to clean up the following selector? i'm trying to dig through some ugly nested frames http://dpaste.com/615030/
[13:07:30] <eddiemonge> panfist: that is just so dirty looking
[13:07:45] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets it was a netsplit, also i suppose that they are upgrading some servers
[13:10:56] <erichynds> panfist: $("iframe").eq(0).contents().find('a[href^="javascript"]')
[13:10:59] <erichynds> maybe
[13:12:05] <panfist> $('iframe') doesn't do anything, neither does $('frame').eq(x).contents() where x is 0 or 1
[13:12:29] <panfist> the site is a printer web interface that i'm pretty sure was written in 1998 or something, before iframes at least
[13:12:39] <erichynds> ah, didn't see the "frame"
[13:14:00] <erichynds> contents() should still work on frames though
[13:14:46] <Jobbe> is it possible to do a crossdomain post with jquery?
[13:16:09] <panfist> erichynds: maybe the problem is that it's double nested...a frame within a frame within a frame
[13:16:12] <aca20031> So my helper apparently got netsplit and didnt come back :( I want some way to kind of get an onLoad event on a div or something similar in order to use jQueryUI to turn them into progress bars without having to assign them all an ID or something
[13:16:17] <aca20031> Example: onLoad="function () { $(this).progressbar(value:<?php echo($v); ?>); }"
[13:16:41] <panfist> well, i dunno but $('frame').eq(1).contents() returns nothing
[13:16:46] <erichynds> :/
[13:16:50] <panfist> an empty array to be precise
[13:17:06] <Jobbe> I'm gonna try again :P is it possible to do a crossdomain post with jquery?
[13:19:17] <Jobbe> WOooo
[13:19:17] <zoned> jyay
[13:19:23] <panfist> what about just cleaning up the last part, $('a[href^="javascript"]') ... is there another way to try to select javascript links, like there's a special way to select external links
[13:20:54] <alaing> where the best place to discuss canvas?
[13:21:23] <jasonrsmith> alaing, an irc channle that isnt splitting
[13:22:11] <alaing> ? lost me
[13:22:12] <aca20031> ok im going to ask again since my text was lost in crazy netsplits
[13:22:14] <bot-t> alaing, #9472 ($.ajax: X-Requested-With header gets lost....request send ... - Opened 4 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9472
[13:22:15] <aca20031> I'd like a way to execute some javascript in the context of an element as soon as it loads on the page, something like <div onLoad="function () { $(this).progressbar(value:<?php echo($v); ?>); }">
[13:22:44] <alaing> lol bot sticking his nose in where its not welcome lol
[13:23:06] <alaing> sorry jasonrsmith you lost me
[13:26:46] <zeppo> hello friends
[13:27:15] <zeppo> im trying to hide all extra images in a div
[13:27:21] <zeppo> so i've tried this
[13:27:21] <zeppo> $(".item_cont a img").not(":eq(0)").hide();
[13:27:59] <alaing> zeppo what do you mean by extra? as in overflowing images?
[13:28:17] <zeppo> only want to show the first one and hide all others
[13:28:29] <enyovelcora>  Hi there. I'm working on a plugin in jquery and was wondering: If I need to store an element for something, should I store the actual element, and call $() every time I need it, or should I directly store the jQuery object?
[13:28:31] <zeppo> if theres one it hides it anyway
[13:28:54] <alaing> zeppo: do you have some code to look at....paste it in jsfiddle.net
[13:29:01] <zeppo> sure one sec
[13:29:12] <alaing> ok
[13:30:47] <dabear> enyovelcora: store the jquery object, or both
[13:30:50] <dabear> if you need it
[13:30:54] <dabear> you rarly do
[13:31:27] <enyovelcora> dabear: thanks
[13:32:00] <zeppo> http://jsfiddle.net/jojoroxursox/M9Yau/
[13:32:19] <zeppo> full one is here
[13:32:19] <zeppo> http://www.konstructive.com/projects/karlssonwinnberg/
[13:32:39] <zeppo> the selector is this $(".item_cont a img").not(":eq(0)").hide();
[13:34:18] <ccmonster> need some help with async google analytics. Anyone got some experience?
[13:35:02] <ccmonster> I put the ga snippet in my head, but then I want to do the async calls throughout my various functions, but it keeps telling me 'uncaight exception: gaq not defined"
[13:37:56] <nail_> zeppo: your line is correct, the problem is somewhere else
[13:38:17] <nail_> zeppo: I'd rather write that $('.item_cont a img:gt(0)').hide() though
[13:38:30] <zeppo> ah
[13:39:35] <Symbi0nt|GER> I need a tip, I have two .live events, mouseover and mouseout. I show a div with a high z-index, which overlaps other divs. My problem is that the mouseover event is called even if the mouse is visually not touching the beneath laying divs.
[13:39:51] <Symbi0nt|GER> i'm using 1.3.2
[13:40:18] <Symbi0nt|GER> so mouseover events are visually called at the wrong time. even if mouseout not really happend
[13:40:34] <zeppo> still dont understand how it still removes the ones with only one child
[13:40:38] <zeppo> strange...
[13:41:21] <nail_> it doesn't
[13:41:25] <nail_> not that line, at least
[13:42:29] <chovy> how do i select an input field by name when it uses array syntax for the name? ie: <input name="foo[]" /> -- $("input[name=foo[]]") does not appear to work, nor does $("input[name=foo]")
[13:42:32] <zeppo> well i get 90% of the content disappearing if i apply it
[13:42:55] <nail_> zeppo: see http://jsfiddle.net/pwzkE/
[13:43:01] <nail_> your problem is somewhere else
[13:43:57] <zeppo> yeah you're right
[13:44:04] <nail_> chovy: $('input[name="foo[]"]')
[13:44:31] <chovy> thanks
[13:44:46] <zeppo> Symbi0nt|GER: could that be a css issue?
[13:48:18] <BillCriswell> I just want to make sure this is all right. I tried changing an input's "type" with .attr() and I got an error saying "can't change type". I then tried it with .prop() and it worked. Should I expect anything to blow up in my face?
[13:51:38] <panfist> does jquery provide anything nice for analyzing links with href=javascript:foo(bar, ...)
[13:55:07] <Connor_> @Panfist don't think so, you can do $('a').attr('href') then have a play with the value
[14:05:07] <mbtez> how do i get the position from top/left of an element on a page
[14:06:22] <Connor_> @mbtez .position() ?
[14:07:03] <mbtez> returns a function ?
[14:07:04] <mateus73> Hi guys I am looking for a shopping cart .. any suggestion? php5 and jQuery
[14:07:14] <shoelessone> Magento?
[14:07:25] <shoelessone> mateus73: Magento?
[14:07:31] <Guest34546> aaa
[14:07:50] <mbtez> n/m i got it
[14:07:52] <mateus73> shoelessone, oh well what I am looking for is a module .. to integrate on my partially built website
[14:08:24] <mateus73> shoelessone, There's going to be quite a bit of work to do .. I don't mind
[14:12:04] <shoelessone> mateus73: gotcha! not much help then, sorry :( - If it were me I'd probably be using CodeIgniter and see if any of the community cart plugins would work for you
[14:12:15] <interopcop> I have a div with a height property and a jquery toggle.  I just need to know ohw to change the height property of the div inside the toggle.  Howyoudothat?
[14:13:13] <Connor_> ?demo interopcop
[14:13:14] <mateus73> shoelessone I am symfony2 and looking for something to then create a bundle (module) for sf2
[14:13:14] <bot-t> Connor_, Couldn't find "demo interopcop" in jQuery Docs.
[14:13:38] <Connor_> Don't know the command :(
[14:15:42] <aibo> hey
[14:15:58] <reckoner> yoo
[14:16:55] <reckoner> my $.ajax({url:"/foo",type:"POST"}); just hangs forever. anyone ever have this happen?
[14:17:04] <aibo> i have to functions, function1 is triggert by windows.scroll and function2 is triggert by clicking on a link, how can i disable function1 while function2 is execuited?
[14:18:01] <ale_> Is there any way to open a popup with-out being blocked? Like opening it on a new tab?
[14:19:01] <aibo> ale_: does it nee to be a own window? oitherwise u could use lightbox oder alternatives
[14:19:19] <ale_> aibo: what's that? sorry, I don't know it
[14:20:05] <ale_> aibo: I mean, I want to show the same webpage, with a new application running on it
[14:20:32] <ale_> aibo: will it work ?
[14:20:48] <aibo> ale_: http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[14:21:17] <ale_> aibo: It won't work
[14:21:25] <aibo> ale_:u can load everything inside it, a page, a picture, a flashmovie etc.
[14:21:36] <ale_> aibo: Oh really?
[14:22:05] <ale_> But if I click outside, I will loose it
[14:22:07] <aibo> yeah but use pirobox if u want to load a website
[14:22:36] <Connor_> Am I understand this correct, you can't set a 'right' value with offset()
[14:22:47] <Connor_> Only left and top :s
[14:22:48] <ale_> aibo: Why? What's the difference?
[14:22:55] <aibo> ale_: http://www.pirolab.it/pirobox/
[14:23:17] <aibo> ale_: i prefer piro, it's more customizable and faster in my opinion
[14:23:48] <aibo> ale_: simply click on the "HTML Content" link to see the example
[14:23:54] <ale_> aibo: oh ok, thanks, let me try it  :D!
[14:24:12] <aibo> :)
[14:24:31] <interopcop> how do you change a div attribute (i.e. height) from jquery?
[14:24:47] <Connor_> $(element).attr('height', 12345);
[14:24:47] <Connor_> Or
[14:24:52] <Connor_> $(element).height(243124123);
[14:24:56] <Connor_> Or
[14:24:58] <interopcop> and I assume as soon as it is changed, it re-renders automatically, right?
[14:25:03] <Connor_> $(element).css('height', 123423)
[14:25:09] <Connor_> Yeah
[14:25:22] <Connor_> Or
[14:25:25] <Connor_> Hmmmmm
[14:25:29] <Connor_> Depends how you mean
[14:25:34] <ale_> aibo: Is there any way to just close the html content when the user clicks the X and not when it clicks outside the container?
[14:25:58] <aibo> ale_: for sure :)
[14:26:40] <Connor_> How do I set a 'right' css value? :/
[14:26:48] <Connor_> Offset() and css() don't work
[14:27:06] <Perel> So does jQuery still not allow cross-domain $.get requests even if the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is set on the response?
[14:27:16] <aibo> Connor_: really? with a previous set position?
[14:27:31] <Connor_> $wrapper.find(options.element).css('position', 'absolute').offset(offsetObject);
[14:27:34] <Connor_> Dosen't work at least
[14:27:45] <Connor_> And same with changing offset to css('right', blarg);
[14:27:54] <Connor_> offsetObject containing right value ofc
[14:28:04] <sanguisdex> are there any browser plugins for quickly extracting jquery path's for elements (chrome would be prefered)
[14:28:16] <Connor_> http://development.connorburton.com/Half-Carousel/
[14:28:19] <Connor_> ^ Demo
[14:28:32] <Connor_> I console logged the offsetObject
[14:28:33] <Connor_> And nope
[14:28:42] <Connor_> And looking inthe jQuery source it only seems to look for top and left
[14:28:50] <Connor_> Otherwise uses prop(), but not sure what that does
[14:29:06] <aibo> mhmm
[14:29:12] <Connor_> Oh property :P
[14:29:18] <Connor_> Uhm, but yeah still nothing
[14:29:31] <Connor_> Ill try jsfiddle it
[14:29:32] <aibo> and the position:absolute is previously set to element?
[14:29:41] <Connor_> position absolute is set in jquery with css
[14:29:47] <Connor_> And the parent has positon relative too
[14:31:16] <aibo> mhmhmhmhm
[14:32:22] <Connor_> Okay apparently works in jsfiddle
[14:33:59] <Woet> ah
[14:36:18] <Connor_> Figured it out, width() dosen't return a string, only the int
[14:36:22] <Connor_> So I have to add 'px' on the end :P
[14:36:35] <aibo> :D
[14:36:58] <Woet> Connor_: The difference between .css(width) and .width() is that the latter returns a unit-less pixel value (for example, 400) while the former returns a value with units intact (for example, 400px)
[14:37:03] <aibo> haha just messed with this on my window.height() :D
[14:37:07] <Perel> Works in everything except IE, just trying to find an IE workaround. really don't want to have to proxy everything to JSONP unless that's really the only way..
[14:37:28] <Woet> [23:27:07] <Perel> So does jQuery still not allow cross-domain $.get requests even if the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is set on the response?
[14:37:31] <Connor_> Indeed Woet, I should probably check what is actually being returned :P
[14:37:32] <Woet> browser control, not jquery
[14:38:13] <aibo> any simple methode to block a fucntion while anothther is executed? like a handler?
[14:39:58] <Connor_> @aibo you mean to not run the function until another is finished?
[14:40:32] <aibo> yap
[14:40:51] <Connor_> Sec ill jsfiddle it
[14:40:58] <aibo> it's a bit difficult, because function1 is triggert by window.scroll
[14:41:18] <Connor_> Actually hmm
[14:41:19] <aibo> and the other is the localScroll function of the scrollTo plugin :)
[14:41:26] <Connor_> You need to use a call back
[14:41:34] <Connor_> Ideally
[14:41:43] <Perel> Woet: Okay, so it is a browser bug / "feature" with no workaround except completely changing how I load anything remote. Thanks for confirming.
[14:41:59] <Woet> Perel: why rely on cross-domain requests client side in the first place?
[14:43:37] <aibo> Connor_: but the callback just tells the function when the first is finished... but dunction2 should work before the other function is called in general
[14:44:00] <aibo> just disable it while scrolling via the scrollTo plugin
[14:44:11] <aibo> am i right? *confused*
[14:44:16] <Connor_> Do you have a demo? :P
[14:44:24] <aibo> yap
[14:44:50] <aibo> query okay?
[14:50:13] <Perel> Woet: Because I have to inject this script on domain A, then have it load dependencies from domain B. I can put the CORS header on domain B but can't put a proxy on domain A. (domain A is an "enterprisey" web app that's stuck in Web 1.0, I can insert a <script> tag on the page but that's about it)
[14:51:42] <Perel> Woet: I need to load an html file and put it in a div. Was hoping to avoid encoding the whole html into the JS itself, or using JSONP of the whole file..
[14:52:04] <Woet> sounds like a million silly workarounds
[14:52:37] <Connor_> If you just need to load files from domain B then use PHP
[14:52:45] <Connor_> Create a local file on domain A and then ajax it in
[14:52:55] <Perel> Woet: Oh, definitely. But I have no control over files on domain A.
[14:53:16] <Connor_> What domain can you affect files on?
[14:53:30] <Connor_> It should still be the same logic
[14:53:49] <Perel> domain B is a server I 100% control, they don't share the same TLD though
[14:54:31] <Connor_> So on domain B, do an ajax call to a PHP file that cURL's whatever files you need form domain a and then returns the contens of the file or alternativley creates a local version of it on domain B to ajax in later
[14:54:42] <Connor_> need from*
[14:55:11] <Connor_> Javascript isn't really built to do any cross site functionality
[14:55:16] <Perel> Connor_: Other way around. My code is running in domain A's context. Can't iframe it because it needs to interact with other elements on the page.
[14:55:17] <aibo> Perel: mhm, i have a similar problem... but why don't u use a phpfile which simple includes the desired site, parse it, change the paths easily and use it?
[14:55:50] <aibo> *had
[14:56:05] <Perel> aibo: If I could I would, but I can't put my own PHP on domain A which is what the script is running in the context of
[14:56:40] <Connor_> How is your script running on domain a, do you upload the script or does domain a pull it in?
[14:56:45] <Woet> Perel: and domain A is?
[14:57:04] <aibo> so you know the script running on domain a and have to do something to make it get content from domain b, without touching files on domain a?
[14:57:16] <Laire_> Why I don't get an alert when I choose an option from the list: http://jsfiddle.net/9UzJj/
[14:57:35] <Connor_> Oh I see
[14:57:39] <Connor_> Reading your original message
[14:57:43] <Connor_> Hm, that is a tricky one indeed
[14:57:50] <aibo> Laire_: works for me
[14:57:52] <Woet> Laire_: because a select option doesnt have onclick?
[14:57:54] <Perel> domain A is a web application. I can add a <script src="file on domain B"> tag to the footer of every page served
[14:58:13] <Woet> Laire_: use .click on the select and use .val to find out which one is selected
[14:58:33] <Perel> but since the script tag itself is on domain A's page, it runs as domain A
[14:58:39] <Laire_> aibo: wich browser you use?
[14:58:57] <Connor_> Does the script on domain A need to dynamically update, or does it just need to get some content once?
[14:58:58] <Laire_> Woet: I will try
[14:59:04] <aibo> ff 6.0.2
[14:59:13] <Perel> No, it just needs to load once per page load
[14:59:51] <Connor_> So why do you need to remotley query it, can't you just load whatever data you need into the script before it gets sent to domain A?
[15:00:09] <aibo> only by clicking not by selecting it via keybord but i guess that's intended
[15:00:14] <ngharo> Laire_: http://jsfiddle.net/9UzJj/3/
[15:00:27] <Perel> Maintainability mostly. Since it works in every other browser I was hoping to be able to keep the div contents as a separate file.
[15:00:52] <Connor_> You could, on Domain B where the original script lives
[15:01:03] <Connor_> Do file_get_contents to get contents from another file on Domain B
[15:01:10] <Connor_> And do it that way
[15:01:37] <Perel> oh, good idea. still would have to escape it though
[15:02:32] <Connor_> Yeah, just remove all return carriages and new lines
[15:02:37] <Connor_> http://pastebin.com/RrmhdNPV
[15:02:46] <Connor_> I had to do a very complicated one of them at work last week :P
[15:03:21] <Perel> and escape all backslashes, right?
[15:03:27] <Perel> *slashes
[15:03:48] <Perel> great, thanks
[15:03:57] <Connor_> Not sure about backslashes
[15:04:22] <Connor_> I would just do strip_tags and str_replace all new lines and carriage returns out of the contents
[15:04:23] <Connor_> If possible
[15:04:34] <Connor_> But totally depends what the contents is :P
[15:05:51] <Connor_> Tink I found a bug in jQuery
[15:05:58] <Connor_> Or at least a questionable usability issue
[15:06:07] <Connor_> This works:
[15:06:13] <Connor_> var object = {};
[15:06:25] <Connor_> object[anotherObject.key] = 'something';
[15:06:31] <Connor_> That is prefect
[15:06:35] <Connor_> But this doesn't
[15:06:46] <Connor_> var object[anotherObject.key] = 'something';
[15:06:50] <Connor_> Unless I am doing it wrong
[15:06:57] <ryanneufeld> you're doing it wrong
[15:07:28] <ryanneufeld> do it the way that works
[15:07:38] <mate1> hi everybody, please, is there any problem with .ajax when it is called continuously? … after several 1000 of ajax request (without any processing) the safari eats >100MB memory
[15:08:30] <ryanneufeld> mate1: I'd be more suspect of you missing something in your code, and having orphaned variables lying around
[15:08:33] <aibo> ryanneufeld: lol
[15:09:19] <damjan> so, I need to make a longpoll request … all is ok with $.ajax or $.getJSON, but I was wandering about making it more robust…
[15:09:56] <damjan> for example, the request might get stuck without the browser knowing it, so that the error handler is not invoked
[15:10:08] <ryanneufeld> where did you wander?
[15:10:09] <damjan> do you have any suggestions how to deal with this?
[15:10:18] <damjan> ryanneufeld: sorry, wonder
[15:10:28] <Connor_> How would/does it get stuck
[15:10:59] <damjan> Connor_: there are a lot of possibilites, a router going dead somewhere on the path, suspend/resume the laptop, etc...
[15:11:31] <ryanneufeld> damjan: it should timeout, but I'm not familiar with longpoll
[15:12:03] <ryanneufeld> if something happened, the browser would detect the break in the connection, or if it's polling it won't be a constantly open connection
[15:12:07] <ryanneufeld> so it will notice
[15:12:10] <Connor_> Indeed
[15:12:29] <Connor_> Anything else is a user error, and it's not really an issue
[15:13:06] <mate1> ryanneufeld: this is my code http://194.1.141.84/mate/jquery/code.txt … may you loot at it?
[15:13:21] <ryanneufeld> I don't really need to loot your code man
[15:13:26] <damjan> well, no… a router or firewall can silently start DROPing packets, and the browser will not know it, until the TCP timeout fires… and that can be several hours
[15:13:46] <ryanneufeld> never heard of a TCP timeout being in the hours
[15:14:09] <mate1> ryanneufeld: it is only small part of the code … very simple ajax request
[15:14:32] <damjan> it is… you can tweak it, but it's still big, and you can't expect people to have those tweaks
[15:15:30] <fructose> Is there a way to get the calling object from inside a function, e.g. get the <a> that makes a call using an onClick event?
[15:16:01] <mate1> damjan: ok, i simplified it, now it has only 30 very simple lines
[15:16:29] <amitprakash> Hi.. given an element X, how can I use a selector to select the closest matching element of type T preceding X
[15:16:46] <Perel> Yay, that works now.. on to the next IE specific "issue" Thanks!
[15:17:03] <damjan> fructose: $(this) afaik
[15:17:23] <Connor_> amitparkash .closest(t);
[15:18:38] <ngharo> mate1: have you tried using chrome's profiler?  like taking a heap snapshot..
[15:19:14] <fructose> damian004: That seems to just give me the whole Window
[15:19:55] <mate1> ngharo: i am using safari/webkit …
[15:20:01] <damjan> mate1: ah, now I see it... I was answering to ryanneufeld, not to you.. about the TCP timeout
[15:40:36] <fructose> I'm trying to match whatever the previous form is on a page, not knowing if the current object or form is nested. Does jQuery provide a method for doing this?
[15:43:19] <AfroTurf__> is there a way to see which elements have events attached to them?
[15:43:40] <cook1es> Hi, what was that trick to avoid events (mouseover, mouseout, mouseover, mouseout) from building up?
[15:44:09] <ajpiano> ?fix hover
[15:44:10] <bot-t> The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[15:46:49] <cook1es> ajpiano: great thanks, .stop(true, false) is exactly what I was looking for
[15:47:06] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:47:13] <ProLoser|Work> how do i prevent a form submit from refreshing the page?
[15:47:27] <ajpiano> the same way you always do, event.preventDefault() in the submit handler....
[15:47:27] <Dave_Stein> bind to form and return false / event.preventDefault()
[15:48:07] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano do i get any benefit from using preventDefault? i almost always use return false; i can only think if i wanted to return a value AND stop form submit. i think i just answered my own Q

[15:59:14] <amitprakash> Hi.. how can I pass the variable group_new to the callback function in each in the code @ http://pastebin.com/sGjw4V5N
[15:59:49] <Dave_Stein> $('#el').bind( 'click', { same_data : true }, callback );
[16:00:04] <Dave_Stein> ?bind amitprakash
[16:00:06] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, Couldn't find "bind amitprakash" in jQuery Docs.
[16:00:12] <Dave_Stein> ?amitprakash bind
[16:00:14] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, Couldn't find "amitprakash bind" in jQuery Docs.
[16:00:17] <Dave_Stein> im a noob
[16:00:39] <ajpiano> ?bind @ amitprakash
[16:00:39] <bot-t> amitprakash, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[16:00:56] <Dave_Stein> :)
[16:01:10] <Dave_Stein> fix had different syntax earlier and i got thrown off
[16:01:53] <Dave_Stein> oh i got another good question for ya maybe you have another article
[16:02:09] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/q4GA2/ is this documented anywhere?
[16:02:41] <amitprakash> Dave_Stein, how does bind help my scenario? isn't $("input").bind( "change", same as $("input").change(
[16:03:29] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash yeah i usually dont do shortcut methods
[16:04:06] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash you can do $('#el').change( {  x : 1  }, callback )
[16:04:10] <amitprakash> Dave_Stein, right, but that doesn't answer my question of being able to pass variable to the callback to each
[16:04:29] <Dave_Stein> amitprakash inside the callback, it has the event data
[16:04:36] <Dave_Stein> function( e ) { e.data.x }
[16:04:42] <amitprakash> hmm
[16:05:05] <Dave_Stein> sorry forgot that part :)
[16:08:07] <dooood> Hi
[16:09:06] <dooood> What would you guys recommend me for setting up an internet radio? like for the server, and streaming it?
[16:09:14] <karega> why would I get an error when I attempt to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?
[16:09:18] <thomasdavis> a
[16:09:25] <karega> I am sending a post from http to https
[16:10:07] <Dave_Stein> karega i would imagine it's not secure goign from http to https
[16:10:21] <Dave_Stein> dooood that is so far from just a JS question :)
[16:10:31] <Dave_Stein> karega but i'm not positive, not my thing
[16:10:42] <karega> Dave I originally get a 409 response
[16:11:09] <karega> But I thought if I altered the headers to change the origin then it would be fine
[16:11:16] <fructose> I'm trying to match whatever the previous form is on a page, not knowing if the current object or form is nested. Does jQuery provide a method for doing this?
[16:12:00] <Dave_Stein> fructose jQuery doesn't do crazy traversing, just up down left right
[16:12:24] <dooood> Dave_Stein: Haha I know :( I was just thinking about that
[16:12:28] <Dave_Stein> fructose if you add a class to each form, you can $('.class') and then use indexof on current form
[16:12:41] <Dave_Stein> fructose then youd know what index in that array your current form is, you can backtrack by one
[16:12:43] <karega> fructose, do you think you should be nesting forms?
[16:12:54] <Dave_Stein> i think he means having two forms and hes not sure if the parent is the same
[16:13:01] <Dave_Stein> nesting forms doesnt work
[16:13:13] <fructose> There are no nested forms
[16:13:56] <karega> index of will work from the root it doesn'thave to have a class
[16:14:07] <fructose> Dave_Stein: And I don't have a 'current' form. I have a link (e.g. 'Update form') and want it to apply to whatever the previous form is
[16:14:24] <ajpiano> fructose: that means you *do* have a current form
[16:14:38] <fructose> ajpiano: If I do, I don't know how
[16:14:40] <Dave_Stein> fructose that link should be in the form
[16:14:46] <fructose> No, it's not in a form
[16:14:54] <ajpiano> fructose: $(this).closest("form")
[16:15:02] <fructose> <form></form><a href="..."></a>
[16:15:03] <Dave_Stein> that only goes up in parents, he was saying it might not be in same parent
[16:15:09] <ajpiano> fructose: $(this).prev()
[16:15:16] <ajpiano> fructose: remember when i gave you this code yesterday
[16:15:17] <ajpiano> http://services.jquery.com/%23jquery_20110913.log.html#t16:46:53
[16:15:21] <karega> ajpiano, help me
[16:15:28] <Dave_Stein> he said he wouldnt know if its nested or previous
[16:15:41] <fructose> ajpiano: Except neither of those work when I don't know it's position relative to the form
[16:15:44] <karega> Dave_Stein, regardless the form would have an index
[16:16:06] <ajpiano> fructose: is it either inside of it or immediately after it
[16:16:26] <ajpiano> karega: i don't know
[16:16:35] <fructose> ajpiano: Not necessarily, no
[16:16:52] <ajpiano> so you have no idea
[16:16:58] <ajpiano> what the relationship will be
[16:17:04] <karega> ajpiano, you know my problem?  the 409 conflict.
[16:17:21] <ajpiano> you just want it to get "the previous form" according to your intuivive understanding of what "previous" means?
[16:17:34] <ajpiano> karega: no
[16:18:06] <karega> no you don't know my problem or no you don't know a solution
[16:18:12] <ajpiano> both
[16:18:27] <fructose> ajpiano: I don't think previous in intuitive... it'd be a depth-first traversal
[16:19:01] <ajpiano> from where to where
[16:19:12] <Dave_Stein> hey i disappeared
[16:19:13] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/pezdB/
[16:19:16] <ajpiano> clearly there is some sort of logic that ties these things together
[16:19:16] <Dave_Stein> fructose: check that
[16:19:33] <fructose> ajpiano: Any node to whatever the previous form is
[16:19:47] <Dave_Stein> fructose: although a better solution would be to have matching classes but if you were in a horrible world that you describe, i think thats the answer
[16:19:47] <ajpiano> and how do you define "previous"
[16:19:56] <Dave_Stein> :)
[16:20:07] <ajpiano> its parent? its previous sibling? the previous sibling of its parents parent?
[16:20:21] <ajpiano> it can't just be "wherever the hell i think 'previous' should be"
[16:20:30] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano +1
[16:20:34] <fructose> ajpiano: Are you familiar with a depth-first traversal of a tree?
[16:20:46] <Dave_Stein> fructose: is http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/pezdB/ what you mean?
[16:21:01] <fructose> Dave_Stein: Looking...
[16:21:07] <ajpiano> fructose: sure, you could do that type of thing where you just check until you find $(this).someTraversal().length
[16:21:59] <ajpiano> but you're not starting from the top, you're starting from some arbitrary point and going upwards/backwards
[16:22:14] <Dave_Stein> gotta go, girlfriend downstairs, aj im gonna bug you tomorrow to see what the answer was to this :)
[16:22:14] <fructose> Dave_Stein: It's not necessarily a 1:1 relationship of links to forms
[16:22:27] <Dave_Stein> fructose: then ajpiano is 100% right, you need tod efine what previous is
[16:22:39] <Dave_Stein> fructose: i'd love to see the markup but i g2g
[16:22:47] <John_Dee> Can someone help me get the start/stop functionality to work, and also to find a way for the main function to cycle through the elements endlessly? — http://jsfiddle.net/egsAh/
[16:31:17] <John_Dee> Anyone?
[16:36:35] <ahandy> can you guys help me out? i have a div that is hidden using fadeout and then is neded to be shown again. however when i fadein, it doesnt work. i have to prepend show() to the fade function for it to work. why is that?
[16:39:52] <ahandy> not just fade, all other functions too
[16:43:15] <raiun> how can I prevent the rest of a script from running until after a $.post function is completed
[16:54:20] <danzik171> raiun: Either make the call synchronous (bad) or see ?deferred (much better)

[17:05:09] <Ogredude> heya folks.  I'm trying to use https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon and I'm following the directions on http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ exactly, but my input is only getting a regular datepicker.  I don't even know where to start looking to figure out what's going on with it.
[17:08:42] <ahandy> can someone please tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/g2wxq/
[17:09:44] <snover> because it is broken. next question!
[17:09:52] <ahandy> snover: how exactly?
[17:09:58] <Ogredude> nevermind. jquery ui was being included twice.
[17:10:10] <coldhead> some kind of bug?
[17:10:22] <snover> I would wager.
[17:10:23] <snover> thanks coldhead.
[17:10:46] <ahandy> i think im not using the animated width correctly, can someone point me in the right direction please?
[17:10:47] <coldhead> any time
[17:11:26] <coldhead> ahandy: this is the right: ---->
[17:11:34] <coldhead> and this is the left <----
[17:11:45] <coldhead> also see ?animate
[17:11:46] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:12:39] <johnline> you need jqueryui to use easing no?
[17:12:50] <coldhead> or the easing lib!
[17:12:56] <coldhead> or you can write your own easing fn
[17:12:58] <johnline> yep
[17:12:59] <coldhead> like a boss
[17:13:48] <johnline> maybe i can append easing js to a custom jquery js
[17:13:52] <ahandy> coldhead: i know that. but what does it have to with my code? :s i read the animate page and it says that if i += width, i could just as easily -= width, but isn't working.
[17:14:01] <johnline> im a fan of keeping html requests low
[17:14:57] <coldhead> ahandy: you're determined to make this work, huh
[17:15:11] <ahandy>  $("#right #info_box").animate({"width":"+=310px"}, 500).queue(function() { $("#right #info_    box").animate({"width":"-=310px"}, 500);
[17:15:24] <ahandy> shouldn' that work fine? max #info_box 310px longer, then shrink it 310px?
[17:15:42] <coldhead> i don't know what all this queue() stuff is about
[17:16:02] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jquery
[17:16:09] <ahandy> sure
[17:17:52] <coldhead> ahandy: http://jsfiddle.net/qSeNj/
[17:17:59] <coldhead> that's what i call a reduced test case
[17:18:09] <coldhead> you can see that expands and contracts
[17:18:19] <coldhead> so the +=Xpx is solid
[17:18:32] <coldhead> but i'm using a callback to run afterwards
[17:18:41] <coldhead> because queue() confuses and infuriates me
[17:18:52] <coldhead> wanna see if you can make my version work with queue()?
[17:19:37] <aibo> hey
[17:20:12] <aibo> i think i just accidently wrote a destroy-browser-functionality script...
[17:21:01] <coldhead> what i'd like to see is a script that requires you to reinstall your browser
[17:21:08] <coldhead> you got something like that aibo?
[17:21:32] <aibo> in firefox i resize the window... browserwindows gets black, all controls disappear...not greyed out, really disappear and you can do nothing
[17:21:43] <aibo> somthing like that ever happend to you?
[17:21:52] <aibo> restarted browser multiple times
[17:22:41] <webguynow> trying some basic wacky jQuery - and kinda in a funk
[17:22:54] <webguynow> shadow variables  ??
[17:22:58] <webguynow> if ($('#uno').value=='') { $('#dos').value = ''; }
[17:23:20] <webguynow> should I expect that to work, or do I have something fundamentally wrong ?
[17:24:28] <ajpiano> fundamentally wrong
[17:24:31] <aibo> are there any volunteers for testing?
[17:24:32] <ajpiano> ?val
[17:24:32] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[17:24:39] <ahandy> coldhead: could you maybe try fixing the jsfiddle link i sent here?
[17:24:46] <ajpiano> webguynow use .val to set and get values on jquery objects
[17:25:20] <webguynow> dooooph !   Homer Simpson move on my part   thx  aj
[17:26:39] <aibo> can someon please tell me why this little piece of code just crashes everything? http://jsfiddle.net/FTgyD/
[17:27:14] <ajpiano> aibo: because window scroll happens like, a bajillion times
[17:27:14] <aibo> everything:firefox
[17:27:17] <ajpiano> as you scroll
[17:27:22] <ajpiano> and then you're doing a really intesive dom query
[17:27:25] <ajpiano> on every scroll event
[17:27:29] <ajpiano> you need to debounce
[17:27:51] <ajpiano> aibo: read about it in here http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[17:27:55] <aibo> no no no everything works fine until u resize the window
[17:28:01] <ajpiano> In another example, the scroll event fires continuously in certain browsers, which means in those browsers, any bound event handler will execute (probably) far more often than you want it to. If your scroll handler is modifying the DOM or performing some other expensive computation, throttling it will guarantee that it executes far less frequently.
[17:28:18] <ajpiano> aibo: similar thing
[17:28:22] <ajpiano> resize also fires constantly
[17:28:33] <ajpiano> so you are doing the logic in the resize over and over again very fast
[17:28:38] <ajpiano> again, need to debounce probably
[17:29:11] <aibo> i will use a timeout to call a special function
[17:29:24] <aibo> i just wondered because nothing was effected when i resized
[17:29:33] <aibo> so i just took an alert to controll
[17:29:38] <aibo> boom . browser broken
[17:29:52] <webguynow> I can use Firebug console to see an element  document.getElementById('myelem')
[17:30:07] <webguynow> but when I assign it to a var, it turns out undefined  ?? ?? ??
[17:30:27] <ajpiano> webguynow: you have to type more question marks
[17:30:40] <ajpiano> firefox only reacts when you really type a LOT of punctuation into an irc channel
[17:30:46] <aibo> and use capslock, essential thing!
[17:32:27] <aibo> ajpiano: thank you for the link... but if i have a window in ff with like 10 tabs open... and open my site and resize the window... EVERYTHING gets BLANK
[17:32:54] <ajpiano> even if you just bind an empty function
[17:32:56] <ajpiano> without an alert??
[17:33:08] <ajpiano> just $(window).resize(function() { console.log("foo");  });
[17:33:22] <aibo> i try
[17:34:27] <aibo> nope with log everythings fine
[17:34:35] <aibo> no reaction at all
[17:36:40] <ahandy> can someone please tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/g2wxq/
[17:37:34] <aibo> ajpiano: when i use log i get 2 foos per resize (maximize - > one click)
[17:37:50] <aibo> ajpiano: when i use alert and click maximize, boom.
[17:38:05] <ajpiano> you clearly don't want an alert in there anyway...
[17:38:12] <ajpiano> you need to debounce the resize event
[17:38:14] <ajpiano> for ril
[17:39:08] <aibo> yay
[17:40:12] <aibo> okay fuck js for today, bye
[17:40:14] <aibo> :)
[17:40:32] <aibo> till tomorrow for stupid aibo-questions
[17:40:42] <ahandy> DAMN IT! anyone
[17:41:24] <James13433> im having trouble, trying to find out if a element has a data-small associated with it
[17:41:45] <James13433> am I right in thinking I should use hasData()?
[17:56:37] <coldhead> ahandy: i suggested your problem might be with queue(), rather than animate()
[17:56:48] <coldhead> so maybe read up on queue and make sure you're doing it right
[17:57:00] <ahandy> coldhead: i am.
[17:57:03] <coldhead> OR use callbacks to chain your animations, like in my demo
[17:57:10] <coldhead> because i proved they work
[17:57:26] <coldhead> sorry ahandy, it's my first day using jquery
[17:57:32] <coldhead> i've never used queue()
[17:59:30] <Kamakazi> kind of a javascript question, but if I just say if(variable) and the variable is undefined will that evaluate as false?
[18:00:28] <kadoban> i have a feeling that this is a really dumb question somehow, but how do i get the tag name of an element? and can i set it?
[18:00:47] <_null> tag name?
[18:00:55] <_null> class, id?
[18:00:57] <kadoban> like, h1, h2, etc
[18:01:06] <danzik171> Kamakazi: Yes.  If it's a global variable (on window), you'll need to check it via window.foo though otherwise you'll get reference errors
[18:01:36] <_null> you'll need to be able to select it through an ID or class if it is possible
[18:01:39] <_null> i'm not sure to be honest
[18:01:46] <danzik171> kadoban: .nodeName property to get it - setting it doesn't make any sense.
[18:02:26] <Kamakazi> danzik171: Thanks
[18:02:27] <kadoban> danzik171: well, it kinda makes sense, but i can just work around that. thanks (i'm trying to turn all h1 into h2, etc)
[18:04:33] <posplaw> kadoban: why not just use class names and different tag like span / p ?
[18:06:24] <kadoban> posplaw: it's kind of a weird situation, hehe...explaning would take a while
[18:10:43] <posplaw> kadoban: okay, your wish :)
[18:13:24] <webguynow> $('#mytable tr').has(':checkbox:checked').find('td')   // looks pretty sweet, found on stackoverflow and jsfiddle
[18:13:51] <webguynow> using that how can I get the value of the 5th column for every <tr>  ?
[18:13:55] <cpgo> is there a way to detect enter key pressed vs submit button clicked in a form, or simpler, to disable enter key from submitting a form
[18:14:42] <James13433> I tried to get the small_image $_product->getSmallImageUrl(),but seems to resize it even maller than it should be, is that not the correct function I should be using?
[18:15:33] <Eviltwin> webguynow: Try $("tr td:eq(4)")
[18:15:43] <AfroTurf__> is there a way to see which elements have events attached to them?
[18:16:08] <Eviltwin> AfroTurf: I'm not sure it's possible
[18:16:23] <AfroTurf> or which events have elements attached>
[18:16:29] <Eviltwin> With Chrome/Safari Debug Tools, I think it shows you
[18:16:44] <seancurtis> there's a firebug extension that adds that
[18:16:49] <seancurtis> FireQuery I think
[18:17:16] <Eviltwin> Try jqelem.data("events")
[18:17:26] <James13433> anyone?
[18:17:29] <AfroTurf> hmm ok
[18:17:41] <Eviltwin> James13433: Looks like PHP
[18:17:49] <Eviltwin> This is #jQuery
[18:18:06] <coldhead> This is Zombo Com
[18:18:07] <James13433> Ahh poop, wrong channel, was ment to be in magento, thanks Eviltwin
[18:18:22] <coldhead> lol magento!
[18:18:28] <coldhead> so many minds ruined
[18:18:34] * seancurtis vomits a little in his mouth at the mention of magento
[18:18:51] <James13433> Haha, whats so wrong with Magento?
[18:19:02] * seancurtis doesn't know where to start
[18:19:30] <seancurtis> I spent 6 months trying to customise a "simple" magento site - it was the worst 6 months of my life
[18:19:44] <AfroTurf> hate magento
[18:19:51] <James13433> seancurtis, yeah theres a bit of a learning curve
[18:20:43] <seancurtis> James13433: it's not the learning curve - the whole community around it is crap. The documentation is horrible (worse than the code) and whenever you want help the forum posters just want to sell consultancy services
[18:21:21] <coldhead> when i had a severe psychiatric breakdown one year, i spent some time nailing my scrotum to a coffeee table and dragging it around with me
[18:21:28] <coldhead> but it turns out i was just using magento all that time
[18:21:35] <AfroTurf> lol
[18:21:36] <kadoban> lol
[18:21:47] <seancurtis> roofl
[18:22:09] <rosco_y> How is the <script>'s starting point determined?  http://paste2.org/p/1651120
[18:22:22] <coldhead> and THEN i got an email from the guys who do magento who said "we will remove the coffee table but you must pay us"
[18:22:24] <James13433> Haha love it. dont need to tell me about the docs, ive gotta deal with them dever day!
[18:22:42] <engaged> i have a link on a page which uses jquery to replace itself with some text and no longer be a link but i do <a href="#" id="xx">xxx</a> if the link is below the fold it goes to the top b/c of the #… how can I make it so page doesn't move?
[18:22:54] <James13433> every*
[18:23:03] <SinnerNyx> rosco_y, i dont understand the question
[18:23:07] <webguynow> LOL @ the magento comments
[18:23:25] <kadoban> rosco_y: i also don't understand :/  rephrase?
[18:23:40] <rosco_y> SinnerNyx: thanks, I'm wondering how the system knows not to run notReadyYet()....
[18:24:02] <SinnerNyx> rosco_y,those are function declarations, and they are not run until called
[18:24:21] <rosco_y> kadoban: if you don't use $(document).ready(), is there a danger of running something prior to the pages "ready" state?
[18:24:29] <SinnerNyx> no
[18:24:30] <rosco_y> SinnerNyx: ok :)
[18:24:35] <rosco_y> I gotcha
[18:24:45] <rosco_y> Thank you very much -- doh...
[18:24:48] <engaged> anyone?
[18:24:57] * rosco_y slapping himself upside the head
[18:25:09] <SinnerNyx> but if you place code outside of any function that will be run immediately regardless of whether or not the document is in a 'ready' state
[18:25:17] * rosco_y talking to himself:  "Thanks!  I needed that!"

[18:26:00] <rosco_y> engaged: way over my pay-grade :(
[18:27:15] <DesignerGuy> I've read about $.extend(), but are there things that you can do with classes in MooTools that you can't do in jQuery?
[18:27:44] <SinnerNyx> i'm making my first jquery control. I want to make a slider filled with thumbnails. when the mouse goes near either end I want the slider to animate away from the mouse.
[18:29:01] <SinnerNyx> at present, I have the slider in the document, with a minor issue i will clear up in a moment, and I'm wondering if I should just set the css position property every 20ms (using set interval) in increasing (or decreasing) values, or if there is some way to do some special jquery animate, and then stop it whenever I detect the mouse leave the slider.
[18:29:35] <Eviltwin> It'd be nice if you could do something like http://jsfiddle.net/#jquery-latest to have it be jsFiddle with the latest version of jQuery selected instead of Mootools
[18:37:10] <webguynow> jQuery checkbox for each table row
[18:37:22] <webguynow> $('#mytable tr').has(':checkbox:checked').find('td')
[18:37:47] <webguynow> $("tr td:eq(4)") - to get the value of a column <td>
[18:38:32] <webguynow> and what is the most elegant way to wrap these values up and pass to the server - just put an array in a hidden input field or  ??
[18:39:15] <seancurtis> ?serialize @ webguynow
[18:39:16] <bot-t> webguynow, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[18:39:47] <seancurtis> webguynow: always good to build a page without JS first and get it working, then enhance it with JS :)
[18:40:55] <fakingfantastic> When submitting a form that has a multiselect and no options selected, it obviously doesn't submit a value for that input name. Is there a way to set up the form to fake it, like submit a val="" ?
[18:42:05] <webguynow> great guys, I'll try to run on your suggestions. thx
[18:46:56] <topeak> hi all
[18:47:06] <seancurtis> fakingfantastic: could you add an <option val="" selected></option> as the first item? Why do you need to send val="" to the server? Can't you just say if select = null val = ""?
[18:47:48] <fakingfantastic> seancurtis: im trying to fake out some other ajax callback code
[18:48:06] <fakingfantastic> I don't have access to it's code to override, just I just need to fake it out
[18:48:21] <topeak> how can i get the return value of  $.get ?
[18:48:41] <ahandy> can someone please tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/g2wxq/
[18:48:50] <fakingfantastic> $.get(url, options, function(data) { .... data ... });
[18:49:38] <seancurtis> fakingfantastic: you can post additional data along with an ajax request
[18:50:02] <fakingfantastic> seancurtis: my code is not firing the ajax
[18:50:14] <seancurtis> ahandy: well it's not related but your markup is horrible
[18:50:24] <seancurtis> ahandy: IDs need to be unique
[18:50:43] <ahandy> seancurtis: do you mind trying to fix the problem too :(?
[18:51:03] <seancurtis> you shouldn't need to do $("#row1 #right #info_box") - #info_box should be unique on the page so you should just be able to go $("#info_box")
[18:51:09] <topeak> fakingfantastic, right, I want get the return value of the function in $.get.
[18:51:12] <seancurtis> ahandy: I'm trying to work out what the problem is
[18:51:38] <topeak> $.get(url, options, function(data) { return true });
[18:52:18] <ahandy> seancurtis: click on the image (what should be an image) ont he left, it'll open a box on the right, then click ont eh right, see how it doesnt shrink bar or open one on the left?
[18:52:19] <topeak> I want to get that true.
[18:52:20] <fakingfantastic> topeak: right, data is that value
[18:52:23] <seancurtis> ahandy: looking at what you're doing I'd recommend using an existing slideshow plugin - it'll do all the heavy lifting for you
[18:52:54] <ahandy> seancurtis: this is fairly simple. I'm just familiar with the animated width and im sure thats the problem
[18:54:25] <ahandy> seancurtis: i'm just not familiar**
[18:54:30] <topeak> function foo() { var ret=false;  $.get(url, options, function(data) { ret = true }); return ret;}
[18:55:15] <seancurtis> ahandy: sorry mate - the markup/js is a bit too messy for me to troubleshoot :(
[18:55:29] <seancurtis> ahandy: try isolating the steps
[18:55:37] <topeak> like this. but the ret is always false.
[18:55:56] <ahandy> seancurtis: its not that bad! the markup i mean
[18:56:54] <seancurtis> ahandy: the markup and JS make me cry
[19:35:25] <KingGurke> heh, so, i'm having to fix someone elses jquery/jnice code. the version of jnice i have says: UPDATED: 12.19.07
[19:35:35] <KingGurke> but otherwise i have no clue what version i'm using
[19:36:11] <KingGurke> when i add an item to a select, i'm told i have to call $.jNice.SelectUpdate
[19:36:19] <KingGurke> but i can't seem to locate that in what i've got
[19:38:16] <KingGurke> now, according to this: http://plugins.jquery.com/node/5011
[19:38:35] <KingGurke> they added $.jNice.SelectUpdate after the version i'm using
[19:38:52] <KingGurke> i'd just update, but it breaks the css or something
[19:42:00] <Ogredude> heya folks.  I'm using facebox http://defunkt.io/facebox/ and I need to know how to tell jQuery to add a datepicker widget to the date fields that come up in the facebox.
[19:44:57] <Ogredude> actually, need to figure out how to bind the standard jQuery events to the fields in the facebox, not just datepicker
[19:57:25] <bobbobbins> hey, is there a way to send the source of a whole page over to an ajax call using jquery?
[19:57:46] <Ogredude> whatever. $(".datepicker").live('focus', function() { $(this).datetimepicker(); });
[19:58:47] <bobbobbins> would it just be $(document).html to get the contents of the whole page?
[20:04:22] <danzik171> bobbobbins: Maybe something like '<html>' + document.head.outerHTML + document.body.outerHTML + '</html>' is what you're looking for?
[20:04:59] <bobbobbins> danzik171, yeah, that might just do it...i'll give it a try
[20:09:53] <bobbobbins> hmm, im still not sure how to execute this though...basically i need an onclick that passes that to the next page
[20:10:03] <bobbobbins> but the next page just brings up a download box
[20:26:00] <Jobbe> Just made a JSONP client and server side script that allows information to be transferred cross domain - if anyone wants it then feel free to copy .. HTML: http://pastebin.com/mJrWE2UJ - JS: http://pastebin.com/0uQnGr7m - PHP: http://pastebin.com/avhfBgBz
[20:39:23] <Ox41> Why do I never get to this alert()? $(document).ready(function(){ alert('in function');});
[20:47:52] <Spadeski> Hello everyone
[20:48:04] <Spadeski>  /join #php
[20:50:22] <cpgo> Ox41, you havent included jquery lib or there are errors above it
[20:51:40] <Spadeski> Ok guys I have a scroller that views up and down based on mouse position I want it to go left to right and save the state of the imgs inside?
[21:06:30] <Clinteger> is there something like .fadeTo() that doesn't fade? >.<
[21:09:09] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!! :-)))))
[21:09:42] <Lurzino> is there a way to open a folder dialog to select a folder with jquery?
[21:10:10] <Davey> so, is there a way to make jquery load a script "properly", so I can debug it in firebug? :)
[21:10:49] <Spadeski> irc://freenode/hl2Lurzino you do that with the HTML setting what type it is i think its multiple/file or something
[21:11:18] <Spadeski> Lurzino you do that with the HTML setting what type it is i think its multiple/file or something
[21:13:12] <Lurzino> Spadeski ah you mean to open a folder dialog I should use html/php coding instead of jquery?
[21:13:55] <Davey> Lurzino: you want to upload a *folder*? or have them upload a single file?
[21:14:12] <DesignerGuy> what are some things that are significantly easier in jQuery than in MooTools? (such as .live)
[21:14:16] <Davey> Lurzino: if you want a *folder*, you have to use either flash, or java, pretty much at this point.
[21:15:00] <Lurzino> Davey, just a folder dialog where I can select a folder and get back the path so I can then save a xml file and I processing
[21:16:19] <Spadeski> Guys I need some ideas for my site can you guys help me out if ya would
[21:16:36] <Davey> Lurzino: so… select a server-side folder?
[21:16:41] <Spadeski> open file dialog login html
[21:16:41] <Spadeski> http://gotactics.net16.net/?gp=home
[21:17:51] <Lurzino> no Davey just a local folder
[21:18:27] <Davey> Lurzino: I'm confused, you want them to choose a local folder…so you can save something from the page (or server?) into it?
[21:19:35] <webguynow> I need some selector help - if I have a <p id="myp"> and inside of it <ul id="myul">, how can I select the myul ?
[21:21:06] <webguynow> I've seen odd syntax -some separate elements with a comma, others with a space
[21:21:08] <Lurzino> well davey I am processing a XML file created with db query data and I just need to save the XML file on the client's PC choosing the path where to save it
[21:21:14] <Spadeski> myp.parent ?
[21:21:17] <Spadeski> something like that
[21:21:50] <Davey> Lurzino: so… just send them the file. They will get the save dialog…
[21:22:02] <Spadeski> <form action="http://www.cs.tut.fi/cgi-bin/run/~jkorpela/echo.cgi"
[21:22:03] <Spadeski> enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
[21:22:05] <Spadeski> <p>
[21:22:06] <Spadeski> Type some text (if you like):<br>
[21:22:08] <Spadeski> <input type="text" name="textline" size="30">
[21:22:09] <Spadeski> </p>
[21:22:11] <Spadeski> <p>
[21:22:13] <Spadeski> Please specify a file, or a set of files:<br>
[21:22:14] <Spadeski> <input type="file" name="datafile" size="40">
[21:22:16] <Spadeski> </p>
[21:22:17] <Spadeski> <div>
[21:22:19] <Spadeski> <input type="submit" value="Send">
[21:22:21] <Spadeski> </div>
[21:22:22] <Spadeski> </form>
[21:22:24] <Spadeski> lol
[21:22:36] <tbranyen> well done
[21:23:18] <webguynow> if I have a <p id="myp"> and inside of it <ul id="myul">
[21:23:34] <webguynow> and I've coded a function associated with "myp"
[21:24:04] <Spadeski> webguynow set it as aclass not an id ?
[21:24:32] <webguynow> so  $(this) is "myp"   How do I use a selector to get  "myul" with in "myp" using  $(this)  ?
[21:28:08] <ajpiano> $(this).find(".someSelector") etc
[21:28:12] <ajpiano> whatever selector
[21:28:20] <ajpiano> there's no reason to search for things by id within something with an id
[21:28:25] <ajpiano> because ID is required to be unique in the DOM
[21:31:53] <webguynow> I was curious about table rows, each with a checkbox (array)  php style  name="mychk[]" but you couldn't use the same format for id="..."   maybe you wouldn't need id's for these
[21:40:40] <Davey> so this is interesting, if I load up http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/ and run "$.getScript("http://view.jquery.com/trunk/plugins/tooltip/jquery.tooltip.js")" in the console it loads in such a way as I can see it properly in firebug, and when I run it on my own site, same deal. but if I do $.getScript('/js/main.js') on my site… it's evaled?
[21:40:53] <freechoice11> anyone smart enough to remove the titlebar please let me know. see http://jsfiddle.net/D7BMD/16/
[21:42:06] <freechoice11> Davey: how you know its evaled?
[21:42:15] <ajpiano> freechoice11: use CSS
[21:42:16] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/D7BMD/20/
[21:42:19] <tonyjcamp> http://jsfiddle.net/D7BMD/21/
[21:42:23] <Davey> freechoice11: because of the way it shows up in firebug
[21:42:38] <tonyjcamp> ajpiano beat me
[21:43:34] <freechoice11> thanks guys, you both gave the same working example :D
[21:44:28] <tonyjcamp> His is better ;)
[21:49:31] <freechoice11> i don't know if its better to create a member login dialog and use AJAX to process on login OR make the dialog into a form??
[21:53:08] <zetaNegra> I would suggest making it into a form. if you want to set session variable you would need to refresh the page with the new session variables. At least that is how I would do it.
[21:53:26] <binaryfus10nz> anyone ever seen or applied a facebook like button inside of a lightbox popup ?
[21:54:21] <freechoice11> zetaNegra: thanks bro.
[21:54:55] <Davey> OK, this is /weird/, how it decides to use eval or not :/
[21:56:21] <zetaNegra> yoUr welcome freechoice11
[21:56:43] <lng> hi! $("#currency_id option:selected").val() returns what's in between <option value="1">USD</option> - USD. but how do I get value 1?
[21:56:55] <muzone_> Best way to do custom scrollbars?
[21:57:06] <ae86-drifter> hi, I have this code bind to the mousemove event of the window, it does a calculation which seems to be pretty CPU intensive, is there a way to limit this calculation to say, a max of 4 times per second or something to stop the CPU from getting hammered?
[21:57:30] <zetaNegra> binaryfus10nz. You should be able to do it. remember the lightbox container is just a <div> which you can insert the facebook like button.
[21:57:35] <lng> resolved
[21:58:24] <binaryfus10nz> any lightbox specifically you may use / recommend?
[21:58:41] <binaryfus10nz> currently using shadowbox cause popup is video but i'll take a look can probably do it... just weird couldnt find anything on it
[22:04:49] <ae86-drifter_> sorry, i got disconnected, did anyone reply to my question?
[22:06:06] <Guest73343> ae86-drifter_: no you didn't
[22:06:16] <Cork> but yes you can
[22:06:51] <Cork> in your listner call setTimeout, and or save a date object
[22:07:56] <Cork> if you go the setTimeout rout store the time handle, and if its set don't create a new one, (and reset it in the timer)
[22:08:08] <Cork> or if you save a date, just check how long ago it was
[22:10:55] <tonyjcamp> binaryfus10nz, you might want to check out colorbox.
[22:11:06] <tonyjcamp> Shadowbox is kinda big.
[22:12:22] <Laurent1> Hi guys
[22:12:26] <binaryfus10nz> well I got it working effortlessly only prob now is URL needs to be dynamic and FB code is added in JS need to pass the variable somehow
[22:13:22] <Laurent1> I'm looking at http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/03/jquery-16-released/ and somewhere it says: "Boolean Attributes
[22:13:22] <Laurent1> In jQuery 1.6 Boolean attributes (such as selected, checked, etc.) can now be toggled by passing intrue or false to .attr() to either add or remove them. For example:
[22:13:22] <Laurent1> $("#checkbox").attr("checked", true); // Checks it
[22:13:22] <Laurent1> $("#checkbox").attr("checked", false); // Unchecks it"
[22:13:45] <Laurent1> well I'm confused because this also works before 1.6 (I just tried)
[22:13:55] <Laurent1> so what's the real difference here?
[22:14:24] <Laurent1> I tried that here: http://jsfiddle.net/Evv5D/9/
[22:14:40] <Laurent1> Try before 1.6 and at 1.6
[22:14:53] <Laurent1> same result so I don't really get the change
[22:14:59] <Laurent1> can someone explain to me?
[22:15:49] <coldhead> 'false' !== false
[22:15:58] <coldhead> 'false' == true
[22:16:22] <coldhead> try ('checked', false) and let the good times roll
[22:17:02] <tonyjcamp> <3 you coldhead
[22:17:49] <Laurent1> hum I did use false and not 'false'
[22:17:50] <Laurent1> :)
[22:18:12] <Laurent1> http://jsfiddle.net/Evv5D/9/
[22:18:35] <tonyjcamp> You have $('#myChck').attr('checked','false');  right?
[22:18:59] <Laurent1> nope I have $('#myChck').attr('checked',false);
[22:19:04] <tonyjcamp> http://jsfiddle.net/Evv5D/10/
[22:19:26] <Laurent1> Thanks :)
[22:19:44] <tonyjcamp> np dude
[22:19:49] <Laurent1> thing that I'm saying is that it works on 1.6 as expected as changelog says
[22:19:51] <coldhead> great job everyone
[22:19:53] <coldhead> take 5
[22:20:01] <Laurent1> but ALSO works before 1.6
[22:20:05] <tonyjcamp> I need a rest.
[22:20:05] <Laurent1> which is not expected
[22:20:06] <Laurent1> :D

[22:20:45] <Laurent1> :D
[22:20:48] <coldhead> i've learned to put that behind me
[22:20:51] <coldhead> you should too
[22:20:53] <Laurent1> just wondering you know :D
[22:21:05] <Laurent1> seems it's called a "change"
[22:21:23] <coldhead> well quit asking so many questions or you'll get... disappeared... DUHN DUHN DUHHHHN
[22:21:42] <Laurent1> ahahahah alright alright :D
[22:21:57] <coldhead> does jQuery's attr function show up at YOUR house at night asking why YOU don't follow spec?
[22:22:09] <Laurent1> hum lol I guess not
[22:22:16] <coldhead> no, it doesn't even return our calls
[22:22:19] <tonyjcamp> shit... what if it does for me?
[22:22:29] <Laurent1> lol
[22:22:36] <tonyjcamp> am I screwed?
[22:22:50] <Laurent1> I have the right to be just curious you know :D

[23:37:00] <blackspotwiggins> slow times? :)
[23:37:26] <coldhead> the slowest!
[23:37:48] <coldhead> only 1 person heard it's my first dy using jquery today
[23:37:51] <coldhead> day*
[23:40:50] <Spadeski> Yeah i bet
[23:47:46] <phrearch> morning
[23:48:14] <coldhead> gday phrearch
[23:48:34] <phrearch> i wonder how i can make a delegate that includes a set of a parent and its children, but on click always returns the closest element
[23:48:38] <phrearch> hey coldhead
[23:49:21] <phrearch> $('body').delegate('#some-parent > and-its-divs','contextmenu', function(event){});
[23:50:39] <phrearch> basically i have this structure: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476315/, and need to check whether the clicked element includes a data attribute
[23:51:01] <phrearch> i suppose it should bubble?
[23:52:40] <amccloud> Is there a good way to wait for images to load in an ajax response before inserting the html into the page?
[23:54:51] <phrearch> amccloud: not exactly the same, but maybe this is an option? http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/images/preloading.html
[23:55:20] <rosieres> How can I load content from another webpage into a container without falling into xss issues and not using iFrame ?
[23:55:41] <amccloud> rosieres: proxy?
[23:56:12] <rosieres> amcclound: what do you mean ?
[23:56:52] <phrearch> get the page content with the server and proxy it to the client?
[23:57:02] <amccloud> yes
[23:57:30] <phrearch> but that can have css issues offcourse
[23:57:33] <phrearch> err xss
[23:58:06] <phrearch> you could filter out script tags though
[23:58:10] <rosieres> mhh  ...  seems to be not very handy.. ..
[23:58:44] <phrearch> whats wrong with an iframe?
[23:58:57] <rosieres> think i should grab the page with perl locally, run my scripts over it to modyfy it and then use loadContent . . .
[23:59:38] <rosieres> phrearch: it cuts parts of my particular page ;-)  there are a lot of tooltips ....
