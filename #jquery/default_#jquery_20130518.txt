[00:03:17] <eisenheim> Can someone help me understand where I'm going wrong  - this script, http://pastebin.com/6SCNsgDp doesn't return the result in json
[00:07:34] <eisenheim> well howdy taion809
[00:07:51] <eisenheim> my issue is this script, http://pastebin.com/6SCNsgDp doesn't return the result in json
[00:08:16] <eisenheim> if I alert out result.msg i get undefiened, but if i just alert result it gives a JSON string
[00:10:56] <taion809> have you tried JSON.parse?
[00:13:34] <eisenheim> no because the idea is that the function returns either JSON or a string depending on the boolean encodeInJson - and since I'm returning the ajax request and it has a dataType option thats where I thought I had to put it
[00:14:22] <eisenheim> if I add        ), function(){}, encodeType);    it works fine, but when it's not json it doesn't work.  Should I be using something other than Intellegent Guess?
[00:15:07] <eisenheim> so a better question is what should I set var encodeType to be if I just want it to be default
[00:16:43] <eisenheim> I suppose I should just set it to html since that is what it will normally kick out
[00:17:53] <eisenheim> I guess that's what I"ll do

[09:17:50] <ravenzz> good morning Whirl3d
[09:17:54] <shoky> hiya Whirl3d
[09:18:12] <Whirl3d> Hey guys, It's been a while. What's new? Anything exciting I should now about?
[09:18:21] <Whirl3d> *know
[09:19:20] <zissou> im getting an error that HTMLTableCellElement doesnt have a method html
[09:19:35] <zissou> how then, can i append an input inside an td?
[09:20:26] <Whirl3d> zissou, usually when you get that message it's because you have the html element rather than a jquery object. Try wrapping it in jquery then use the jquery method.html()
[09:20:57] <shoky> nothing new here. all is static
[09:22:58] <Johnson> If I bind an "Click" event to an <a> element without using jQuery, I can do this: <a onclick='xx();'>. Using Chrome debugger, I cannot find that the document.all[?].onclick property is a function, and further exploring, I can the callee is my xx(); function. Now, if I use jQuery, it would in $(document).ready( $("a").click(xx();) ).  However, I cannot find the onclick property of <a> element has anything. So jQuery must have somewhe
[09:23:39] <shoky> Johnson it doesn't use the "onclick" attribute, that's an OLD way of setting event handlers
[09:24:10] <JesperA> also, onclick on the element itself is a javascript function, not jQuery
[09:24:23] <JesperA> so if javascript is activated it will obviously work without jQuery
[09:24:25] <shoky> Johnson: and document.all is non-standard.. its microsoft's

[09:24:29] <zissou> Whirl3d, i can select it in console though.. i thought that jquery does the wrapping when script is loaded
[09:24:53] <Johnson> shoky, yes I know onclick is old.  But which is magic of the new one: jQuery?
[09:24:57] <Whirl3d> zissou, wouldn't you be amazed if I could divine the code you are using?
[09:24:59] <zissou> Whirl3d, should i use wrap on the whole table then to have access to its tds?
[09:25:05] <Whirl3d> zissou, perhaps a sample would help
[09:25:06] <shoky> Johnson: i told you, this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener
[09:25:31] <Whirl3d> When referencing the td you want, how are you selecting it in jquery?
[09:25:39] <zissou> with its class
[09:25:48] <Whirl3d> $(".tdclass")?
[09:25:48] <zissou> $('.tdclass')
[09:25:55] <Whirl3d> $(
[09:26:21] <Whirl3d> $(".tdclass").first().append("<input type='text'/>");
[09:26:48] <Whirl3d> will append an input box to the first element in the .tdclass class
[09:27:06] <zissou> no method. its just like u said. i get the html not a jquery object
[09:27:23] <zissou> never got this before
[09:27:43] <Whirl3d> It is a common mistake to think you can do $(".tdClass")[3].append(",....   but the [3] selects the html element, not the third jquery element
[09:27:46] <Johnson> shoky: Thank, I will check for it.  But I want to find out in a Chrome debugger section, how jQuery store my click-event-handler inside the global.jQuery object.
[09:28:04] <diverdude> is there a very simple way of applying a transformation to each element in an array or do i have to do a manual loop?
[09:28:24] <Whirl3d> $(".tdClass")[3] is not the same as $(".tdClass").eq(3)
[09:28:31] <zissou> i understand that
[09:28:32] <diverdude> nice thing would be something like $(myarray).apply(x*2);
[09:28:51] <diverdude> or $(myarray).apply(function(x){x*2});
[09:28:52] <zissou> when does jquery do the wrapping into objects part?
[09:29:05] <Whirl3d> $()
[09:29:18] <zissou> so it reads through DOM and wraps everything?
[09:29:38] <Whirl3d> $(".tdClass") is the same as document.getElementByClass(".tdClass") (and then give it the jquery juice!)
[09:29:42] <shoky> diverdude:  check out .map()
[09:29:45] <Whirl3d> only what you ask it to
[09:29:49] <Whirl3d> by $()
[09:30:20] <Whirl3d> typo....getElementByClass("tdClass")   no period
[09:30:25] <shoky> diverdude: or if you want it for a plain array, check out $.map
[09:30:41] <zissou> so if i understand u correctly. when u select a dom element, jquery first wraps it in object and then you can call methods on it.
[09:30:58] <Whirl3d> perfect
[09:31:11] <shoky> diverdude:  also javascript has .map() for arrays, except IE<9
[09:31:22] <zissou> so why does it fail to do so in my instance?
[09:31:39] <Whirl3d> without seeing your code, how can I possibly tell?
[09:31:54] <zissou> right. give me a moment
[09:32:14] <diverdude> shoky, is the jq version also ok for IE<9 ?
[09:32:36] <shoky> diverdude: if its a jquery version that supports IE<9, sure
[09:32:48] <diverdude> shoky, its 1.9 :)
[09:33:03] <shoky> then that says it all ;p
[09:34:04] <diverdude> yeh thx m8 thats works

[09:48:51] <zissou> nice work, tnx a bunch
[09:49:30] <Whirl3d> Sorry, the append method was looking for a jquery object. I thought it would take an html string, but it wouldn't for some reason.
[09:50:19] <zissou> to answer your question, because td are showing data which i want to be editable
[09:50:30] <zissou> so im using input to ajax it into db
[09:51:41] <zissou> i was puzzled also cause all my previous attempts were successful. not rly sure why this works but i will learn from it. again, you helped me a lot!
[10:00:08] <Whirl3d> You don't need to have the form and input and button all in the same cell. You could just use the input in the cell and handle the blur event for the input

[10:11:23] <diverdude> so that the resulting array is [2 3 2 2 2 4]
[10:11:37] <Whirl3d> zissou, what about this as an option: http://jsfiddle.net/TLQAe/15/
[10:12:18] <Whirl3d> diverdude, where are your commas?
[10:12:55] <diverdude> Whirl3d, sry, ' ' should be ','
[10:13:41] <Whirl3d> var newArray=$(oldarray).filter(function(e) { var val=parseInt($(this),10); if (val>5) return this; return null;});
[10:16:03] <diverdude> Whirl3d,  ah nice. and even shorter  var newArray=$(oldarray).filter(function(e) { var val=parseInt($(this),10); return (val>5)?this:null;});
[10:16:29] <Whirl3d> returns a jquery object, I'm afraid. Perhaps map is better for this...
[10:16:43] <diverdude> hmm
[10:18:22] <diverdude> Whirl3d, it dont work :/ http://jsfiddle.net/ya4HU/
[10:22:51] <Whirl3d> diverdude, this is easier handled with js.

[10:23:12] <Whirl3d> the first example is exactly what you want..
[10:23:29] <Whirl3d> sorry, I got all wrapped up in jquery goodness for a minute. LOL
[10:37:23] <bwen> I use .trigger('keyup') is there a way for my to alter the object "event" to change the event.which value?
[10:38:31] <zissou> Whirl3d, that could work beautifully =)
[10:39:04] <Whirl3d> Sure would look prettier and be a lot less bulky
[10:39:04] <zissou> Whirl3d, can u explain this line  len=val.toString().length==0?2:val.toString().length;
[10:39:39] <Whirl3d> That may be unnecessary, It takes the value of the cell currently, gets the length of it and uses that for the length of the input
[10:40:15] <zissou> does it default to some value also?
[10:40:24] <Whirl3d> It says, length=val (as a text string)'s length is exactly 0? if so, make it 2, if not, make it the length of the text string
[10:40:25] <zissou> if there's no text
[10:40:45] <zissou> oh
[10:40:45] <Whirl3d> precisely. I picked 2
[10:40:51] <zissou> thats ternary if
[10:41:05] <Whirl3d> sure, what you said!

[11:02:46] <Johnson> Which property of the global.jQuery is storing such relation?
[11:04:08] <c4ptnh00k2> well jquery defins it as an eventObject

[12:53:26] <diverdude> madprops, how do i find the right height of M ? http://jsfiddle.net/PR74x/7/
[12:55:07] <hawtin> photoshop:)
[12:55:46] <diverdude> hawtin, huh what?
[12:56:07] <hawtin> nothing(trolling)
[12:56:14] <diverdude> hawtin, how do you propose to integrate photoshop in the webpage then?
[12:56:57] <diverdude> maybe i can ask the user to install photoshop, write a letter with the font they are using and measure it. then they can enter the height in a textbox
[12:57:11] <diverdude> thats actually not a bad idea
[12:57:38] <diverdude> my uses will have the benefit of learning photoshop also then
[13:07:00] <madprops> that is a terrible idea
[13:08:59] <diverdude> madprops, why?
[13:15:11] <zissou> if .post has an implict value of type: 'POST', what is the implicit value of .load?
[13:15:29] <shoky> zissou: get
[13:15:29] <zissou> $('element').html()?
[13:15:45] <shoky> huh
[13:16:24] <zissou> i want to have load functionality and have been playing around with context option... im trying to change value of an input with callback
[13:17:02] <zissou> it throws: Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[13:17:11] <shoky> "it" ?
[13:17:14] <shoky> `demo
[13:17:15] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:17:18] <zissou> console
[13:17:26] <zissou> ok
[13:20:00] <zissou> http://jsfiddle.net/GdYbh/
[13:21:13] <shoky> assuming inp is a jquery object, you can do inp.val( data )
[13:21:17] <shoky> not .val() = data;
[13:21:28] <zissou> oh right
[13:21:44] <zissou> works, tnx
[13:23:04] <shoky> why use the context option and not just reference 'inp' inside the callback
[13:28:25] <madprops> diverdude: I think it's quite inconvenient to ask a user to install Photoshop
[13:45:33] <diverdude> madprops, really? why?
[13:47:27] <madprops> because it's a big and commercial software
[13:48:16] <madprops> plus it would force the user to use two different applications to do something that should be done in one
[13:53:32] <Nobita> hello this is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/xkUHe/ what I'm trying to achieve is to define width to my '.post-excerpt' as '100%' if my div element with class '.post-image' is not having an img element within its anchor tag, but my code is not working may  I know where is the issue
[13:53:33] <Speedstick> the future of photoshop won't be an install
[13:53:43] <Speedstick> adobes going to charge you like $50 a month to use it
[13:53:58] <Speedstick> believe it's going to be a service type thing...
[13:54:07] <Speedstick> hopefully this sparks a real compeitior now
[13:54:39] <Speedstick> never understood why there weren't real photoshop clones out already, what it does afaik isn't that difficult
[13:56:32] <Whirl3d> Speedstick, afaik is the key to that sentence. I have been using photshop since version 3.0a and there's a lot involved.
[13:57:01] <Whirl3d> but you are right, CS6 is the last installable photoshop version. It's all web-based service from now on.
[13:57:28] <Speedstick> Whirl3d so in your opinion photoshop does things others couldn't implement? like what, the filters?
[13:57:40] <Speedstick> the layers is not an issue, even gimp supports those
[13:58:11] <Whirl3d> How about the various color algorhythms that make it a standard for printshops. Nobody has been able to match the color-space adobe provides through Photoshop.
[13:58:28] <Whirl3d> Not to mention the array of plugins that don't work on any competitors
[13:58:53] <Whirl3d> And the fact that it interfaces with the Adobe suite as well as it does. btw this is not the channel to have this disucssion.
[13:59:33] <pollok> list *dcc*
[13:59:41] <pollok> exit
[13:59:45] <pollok> quit
[14:00:05] <kc8qvp> I am not using jQuery UI, I am using jQuery, and bootstrap...  I think I could like to make a jQuery widget, but I don't want to include UI for the widget factory?
[14:00:19] <kc8qvp> maybe what I want to make is a jQuery plugin.
[14:00:34] <Whirl3d> kc8qvp, what do you want it to do?
[14:00:56] <kc8qvp> I have some elements in my page, that are basically widgets
[14:01:12] <kc8qvp> and I want to be able to have a reference to them, like $var = $('.my_widgets');
[14:01:12] <madprops> lol $50 a month
[14:01:27] <kc8qvp> then I want to be able to do $var.method1() etc.
[14:01:59] <kc8qvp> well, that runs a method on a jquery object set
[14:02:01] <Speedstick> kc8qvp another time sir, another time
[14:02:01] <Whirl3d> You can do that through a plugin. Lookup jquery plugin architecture and there are lots of examples/tuts on it.
[14:02:02] <kc8qvp> but I think you can follow?
[14:02:08] <Speedstick> we'll finish this
[14:02:10] <Speedstick> ;)
[14:02:19] <kc8qvp> Whirl3d: thanks.
[14:02:36] <Speedstick> actually that's @Whirl3d
[14:02:43] <Whirl3d> ;)
[14:02:48] <Nobita> hello this is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/xkUHe/ what I'm trying to achieve is to define width to my '.post-excerpt' as '100%' if my div element with class '.post-image' is not having an img element within its anchor tag, but my code is not working may  I know where is the issue
[14:04:17] <Whirl3d> Nobita, try console.log($(this).has("div.post-image"));
[14:04:58] <Nobita> Thanks Whirl3d , but where outside my code or inside?
[14:05:04] <Whirl3d> I think you will find it is either true or false, but either way the response true or false does not have a method called has to chain them.
[14:05:58] <shoky> has isn't a boolean
[14:06:01] <shoky> it filters
[14:06:26] <Whirl3d> for real. Has it always been like that?
[14:06:43] <Whirl3d> What am I thinking that returns boolean like that?
[14:07:03] <shoky> .is()
[14:07:32] <shoky> Nobita: you probably want something more like:  if (jQuery(this).has('div.post-image a img').length === 0) { ...
[14:07:55] <Nobita> ok shoky, just let me try your one
[14:07:58] <Nobita> thanks for that :)
[14:08:09] <shoky> mmm actually
[14:08:36] <Nobita> but shoky, when there is no image in my .post the img element is not generated
[14:09:05] <Nobita> so how is this gonna work? any suggesstion?
[14:09:46] <shoky> if there is no img, that .has(..) will be of length 0
[14:09:57] <shoky> i donno what you wanna do really so no, no suggestions
[14:14:21] <Nobita> shoky: really man, your code works. thanks a lot for that it really saved my day. btw i am still confused that how did it matched my query if you can just explain me that i will be really thankful again
[14:14:32] <Nobita> shoky: really man, your code worked. thanks a lot for that it really saved my day. btw i am still confused that how did it matched my query if you can just explain me that i will be really thankful again
[14:15:10] <shoky> Nobita:  it would be more natural if that .has() was  .find()
[14:15:15] <shoky> but in either case,
[14:16:18] <shoky> it looks for elements that match "div.post-image a img"  that are descendants of the current .post
[14:17:20] <Nobita> ok
[14:17:20] <shoky> donno what else to say about it ;p
[14:17:32] <Nobita> great thanks a lot for that shoky :)
[14:17:39] <shoky> yw
[14:17:40] <Nobita> have a great day ahead ;-)
[14:17:48] <shoky> u2
[14:18:37] <imdea> Hi, one question: I'm kind of newbie with jquery and javascript, trying to do some ajax stuff with jquery and a php script, very simple, but I'm having a problem: I can invoke my php script successfully using $.post() but this script output is "json_encode($array)" (which is supposed to be an output in JSON format) but for some reason when using my $.post like this: $.post("myscript.php",{arg: value}, function() { .... }, 'json'}); as I am putting 'json' as t
[14:18:38] <imdea> he expected response by the server my jquery script does not take it
[14:18:55] <imdea> but if I put it as 'html' then it take it, I don't understand.
[14:21:14] <shoky> imdea: what happens when you leave it as 'json'? and, pastebin your json and ajax code
[14:21:49] <imdea> shoky, it looks like it doesn't recognize the server response as it guess it is 'html'
[14:21:58] <shoky> imdea:  "it looks like" ?
[14:22:04] <shoky> just say what happens
[14:22:23] <imdea> shoky, huh? that's what's happening, it "looks like" it is not taking it.
[14:22:43] <shoky> whats happening is that something looks like something.. thats not helpful
[14:22:53] <shoky> what are you actually seeing? not what's it like
[14:23:07] <shoky> do you have your console open?
[14:24:04] <imdea> shoky, where should I paste my php code?
[14:24:17] <shoky> not here
[14:24:25] <imdea> shoky, obviously..
[14:24:28] <shoky> i asked for your JSON and your jquery ajax code
[14:24:31] <shoky> not your php
[14:25:29] <shoky> and, do you have your javascript console open? do you know what that is?
[14:26:27] <imdea> shoky, no I don't
[14:26:41] <imdea> my "JSON code" is being generated by my php script.
[14:26:48] <shoky> oh, and you can paste stuff at jsfiddle.net or pastebin.com or wherever
[14:27:16] <shoky> imdea: you must learn to use the console. see ?ftj
[14:27:16] <bot-t> imdea, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:27:35] <imdea> shoky, this is my jquery code: http://jsfiddle.net/fDbzM/
[14:27:41] <shoky> press F12 and find the console, see if you get errors when doing the ajax
[14:28:50] <shoky> what's result and status?  why do you think those are the arguments to the ajax callback
[14:29:05] <shoky> er
[14:29:24] <shoky> nevermind that last question :P
[14:30:01] <imdea> the result is that the alert function is not being executed at all
[14:30:11] <shoky> and what do you see in the console
[14:30:40] <imdea> and what  I get in the console is the request to the PHP script that have 200 http status OK
[14:30:52] <shoky> there's also a network tab in the devtools when you press F12 (if youre using chrome or FF at least), you can see exact response
[14:30:55] <imdea> but the response
[14:31:02] <imdea> i get is some html tags
[14:31:11] <shoky> that doesn't sound like JSON
[14:31:35] <imdea> <html><body>{"givenname":"Joerg","familyname":"Smith"}</body></html>
[14:31:40] <imdea> this is what I get.
[14:31:42] <shoky> ok, that's not JSON
[14:31:48] <shoky> your php is wrong
[14:32:14] <imdea> it should generate output without html tags right?
[14:32:21] <shoky> if you do it right, sure
[14:32:30] <imdea> ok
[14:33:44] <imdea> i don't understand... because i'm using in php: echo json_encode($array) which is supposed to generate a JSON output
[14:34:34] <shoky> i guess you have something else in your php that's outputting the html. or maybe some php framework that's doing it for you implicitly.  i dont know any php anyways, and this isn't the place for that
[14:35:02] <shoky> and as you can see, the json_encode is working fine
[14:35:10] <shoky> you just have something extra
[14:36:31] <imdea> actually is the only "output" that I'm generating, and not using any framework. BTW thanks.
[14:36:52] <Forbidd3n> setting an absolute element with top: 200, isn't the top of all browsers the same?
[14:36:53] <shoky> uhh pastebin your php if you want..
[14:37:06] <Forbidd3n> the element is lower in FF, but the same in all other browers
[14:37:23] <Forbidd3n> sorry higher in FF and the same position in all other browers
[14:37:44] <Forbidd3n> if I measure from the top all browser are correct, but FF isn't
[14:37:48] <Forbidd3n> what would this be caused by?
[14:38:02] <shoky> measure how?
[14:38:09] <jost> Forbidd3n: is do you really have "top: 200" in your css, or is there a unit?
[14:38:53] <Forbidd3n> 200px
[14:39:04] <Forbidd3n> the unit is in the css
[14:39:30] <shoky> so it's not 200px from the top of its positioned-ancestor?
[14:39:32] <Forbidd3n> I printscreen and measure in PS
[14:39:41] <shoky> o.O
[14:40:12] <Forbidd3n> or using JR Sreen Ruler
[14:40:24] <jost> Have you tried looking at it in firebug?
[14:40:37] <Forbidd3n> shoky: let me check, but even if it is from the parent, then it should still be in the same position on all browsers, correct
[14:41:08] <shoky> Forbidd3n: it's hard to answer such questions based on vague information. make a jsfiddle/demo if you want help
[14:41:30] <Forbidd3n> the url I am doing it on - http://www.quiddllc.com
[14:41:48] <Forbidd3n> when you hover on nav, red bar appears
[14:41:49] <shoky> what's the difference in your measurement, btw ?
[14:41:57] <Forbidd3n> sec
[14:42:54] <hawtin> I need some help(don't think its jquery related), dont expect an answer. just a suggestion on what to do / where to go , can I ask it here?
[14:43:15] <Forbidd3n> shoky: if you can look at it in two different browers, one being FF. do you see what I am referring to?
[14:43:28] <shoky> hawtin as long as you don't ask to ask ;p
[14:43:41] <jost> Forbidd3n: It is probably caused by invalid markup. Try to fix  that: <hawtin> I need some help(don't think its jquery related), dont expect an answer. just a suggestion on what to do / where to go , can I ask it here?
[14:43:54] <jost> sorry, I meant this: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quiddllc.com%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[14:44:10] <hawtin> k
[14:44:13] <hawtin> so I have this navigation menu http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/uPqBe/4/ , what I want instead of those number is the number of comments that were posted since the current user been there. I thought about localStorage and cookies to do this but then what if the user logged in from another computer..?
[14:44:58] <hawtin> those are pages where you can only comment, how would I go about it cause I have no clue @_@
[14:45:11] <shoky> Forbidd3n: i don't see any noticable difference
[14:47:01] <Forbidd3n> jost: those errors wouldn't cause this isse though
[14:47:38] <Forbidd3n> shoky: would you know by looking at it why the red bar appears to be showing up differently based on the background image?
[14:48:20] <shoky> Forbidd3n: no idea what you mean
[14:48:50] <Forbidd3n> see where the red line shows up on FF, over the background image line, but on other browsers it is showing up below the background image lie
[14:48:52] <Forbidd3n> line
[14:49:27] <hawtin> so I've asked to ask ? :|
[14:52:37] <shoky> Forbidd3n: sorrry, i still dont see the difference you mean.. looks same to me in FF & chrome
[14:54:19] <Forbidd3n> shoky: not talking about the submenu, I am speaking of the red bar, let me make it black. see what I mean now?
[14:54:22] <Forbidd3n> refresh, please
[14:54:36] <Forbidd3n> see the black line now in both browsers
[14:56:12] <shoky> Forbidd3n: yes i saw it.. i see 2 bars on each side of the screen. they look the same in FF and chrome
[14:57:23] <Forbidd3n> does FF show a top margin of the browser 28px?
[14:57:41] <shoky> umm
[14:57:45] <shoky> on what element?
[14:57:59] <Forbidd3n> the html?
[14:58:11] <Forbidd3n> Fbug is showing me a 28px margin top important
[14:58:45] <shoky> on <html> ?
[14:58:55] <shoky> no margin here..
[14:59:13] <Forbidd3n> hmm
[14:59:14] <Forbidd3n> grr
[14:59:18] <Forbidd3n> thanks for your help
[15:02:04] <Whirl3d> Forbidd3n, wait till you see it in IE. LOL (with you, not at you)
[15:02:34] <shoky> heh
[15:03:35] <Whirl3d> Forbidd3n, looks the same to me in FF and Chrome for what it's worth.
[15:09:06] <mystiiq_> $(el).hide(); el.mouseenter(function(){$(this).show();}).mouseleave(function(){$(this).hide();})
[15:09:12] <mystiiq_> why this does not work?
[15:09:22] <mystiiq_> mouseenter never called if the object is hidden
[15:09:42] <mystiiq_> I want to display an element only if mouse is near it
[15:10:24] <shoky> use visibility:hidden  to hide it, i guess.  .hide()  does display:none
[15:10:54] <shoky> hmm actually no idea if mouseenter works on visibility:hidden
[15:11:09] <shoky> if it doesn't.. opacity:0
[15:18:22] <innociv_> How do I call keydown() but also pass the event saying that keyCode/which 13 was pressed?
[15:37:04] <xid_> can you do union selector with this, like $(this+' .myclass')?
[15:38:00] <shoky> xid_: union? what exactly do you want to select
[15:38:16] <xid_> hmm didn't work
[15:38:34] <shoky> a union would be..  $(this).add('.myclass')   assuming 'this' is some element
[15:38:52] <xid_> oh right, not union.  multiple selector is what i want.  inside of my .each()
[15:39:08] <xid_> er, sub selector
[15:39:14] <xid_> i could just use children()
[15:39:20] <shoky> .find() ?
[15:39:37] <shoky> donno what multiple/sub selector is
[15:39:42] <xid_> just curious if you can concatenate $(this+' .subselector')
[15:39:47] <shoky> what is 'this' ?
[15:39:54] <shoky> and what do you mean by concatenate
[15:39:55] <xid_> it's a selected element by id
[15:40:05] <shoky> you can concatenate strings
[15:40:19] <shoky> and what do you want to select
[15:40:35] <shoky> $(this).find('.subselector')  ?
[15:40:47] <xid_> right, so i'd have to do like $($(this).attr('id')+' .subelement')
[15:40:55] <shoky> this.id  is fine
[15:41:00] <xid_> o thanks
[15:41:05] <shoky> uhmm
[15:41:10] <shoky> but no, you can use .find
[15:41:16] <shoky> $(this).find('.subelement')
[15:41:20] <xid_> yeah that's probably easier to read
[15:41:33] <xid_> thansk
[15:41:33] <shoky> and will work for any element, not just those with an id
[15:41:49] <xid_> although children() will work in my case, since it's a direct child
[15:41:56] <xid_> less overhead than find()
[15:42:16] <shoky> correct
[16:02:54] <diverdude> Why do i get an error saying "canvas.clearRect is not a function" here  http://jsfiddle.net/vFLhU/ ? I thought canvas has a clearRect method
[16:14:00] <kenyabob> When I override a submit function, whats the easiest way to then have the form simply 'submit' as usual once Ive done my logic. Once I use preventDefault to let me process the form, I can't simply turn default behavior back on, can I?
[16:16:11] <Scoding> is there a function that would remove and replace 'class' of an element?
[16:16:34] <kenyabob> .addClass .removeClass .hasClass .attr('class',
[16:17:30] <Scoding> would  .attr('class', 'newclass') remove any other class that was there?
[16:18:27] <shoky> diverdude: didn't you mean context.clearRect ?
[16:18:43] <kenyabob> Scoding: yes
[16:19:08] <Scoding> Thanks
[16:19:39] <slide> Is there a way to make jquery-ui accordian have more than just 1 item open?
[16:19:44] <diverdude> shoky, thanks
[16:20:19] <dabear> kenyabob: use the native form submit function. e.g. $("#form")[0].submit() ( different from $("#form").submit() ..)
[16:20:43] <kenyabob> dabear: very clever
[16:21:41] <bobbobbins> hey, can someone tell me how i can get all elements having a certain class that are not nested within an element of another certain class
[16:21:43] <bobbobbins> ?
[16:22:06] <Gazpacho> i don't think you're supposed to subscript a query
[16:22:16] <Gazpacho> even if it works by accident
[16:22:37] <shoky> you mean [0]? that's fine
[16:22:39] <Gazpacho> nor should it be necessary to select within an ID query
[16:23:00] <Gazpacho> shoky: who says it's fine?
[16:23:44] <bobbobbins> in my example, there is a class called hidden, and in and out of that class are elements with two classes i want(question and answer), but I only want them if they're not in the hidden class(because the person who did the layout is crazy, the hidden class isn't actually hidden, so I can't just fetch it by that)
[16:24:06] <shoky> Gazpacho: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/jquery-object/
[16:24:29] <shoky> Alternatively, because the jQuery object is "array-like," it supports array subscripting via brackets:  var firstHeaderElem = $( "h1" )[ 0 ];
[16:24:45] <Gazpacho> $(all right
[16:25:59] <dabear> bobbobbins: $(".question, .answer").filter( function(){  return $(this).closest(".hidden").length == 0; /* it has not .hidden parent*/  })
[16:26:03] <dabear> no*
[16:26:16] <dabear> meh, ugly, though
[16:26:24] <bobbobbins> dabear: wow, I never would have gotten that
[16:26:35] <shoky> i'd go with .not( function.. )  ;p
[16:26:36] <bobbobbins> can i chain a .serialize onto the end of that?
[16:27:20] <shoky> bobbobbins: yeah you can
[16:27:24] <bobbobbins> sweet
[16:27:56] <bobbobbins> how would i use not in that case?
[16:28:07] <dabear> not what?
[16:28:09] <shoky> it's same as filter, just inverse
[16:28:16] <bobbobbins> oh, gotcha
[16:28:36] <bobbobbins> ah, but closest won't work, sometimes its nested in a few other divs below the hidden one
[16:28:50] <shoky> sounds like a job for closest
[16:29:32] <dabear> you gotta find the logic needed first, then
[16:30:13] <bobbobbins> well i was using .parents().hasClass('hidden'), but that doesn't return the elements, just a true false
[16:30:58] <shoky> dabear's filter should work fine
[16:31:14] <bobbobbins> oh ok
[16:44:05] <gry1> hi, what tool can I use to debug click events in jquery -- i.e. I click a button and would like to walk through the function that gets called step by step?
[16:48:44] <shoky> gry1: in chrome you can set breakpoints on event listeners (devtools->sources->event listener breakpoints) and step from there, it'll start in jquery internal code probably
[16:49:03] <shoky> you can also just set breakpoints yourself wherever you're interested in
[16:49:43] <gry1> I assume that's not working if I have all the JS inside of a script tag and I should move all JS to a separate file?
[16:50:25] <shoky> i think it'll still work. tho doesn't sound like much fun
[16:51:18] <stan_man_can> I've made it so when a user double clicks on some text it becomes editable (replaces the content of the table cell with an input box containing the text that was previously in that cell). The input box that I create has a class of "inlineEdit". I'm trying to make it so when the user clicks anywhere outside the edit box it auto saves the box, but they should be able to click within it freely. I can't get it to work though. $(".inlineEdit").on("click",
[16:51:18] <stan_man_can> function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); }); doesn't seem to work at all.
[16:55:24] <shoky> stan_man_can: you can check e.target in your "outside" click handler, and make sure it's not an input.. e.g.  if ( $(e.target).is('.inlineEdit') ) return;
[16:55:52] <gry1> thanks shoky, got it working in firebug as well, have a good one

[17:11:47] <innociv_> How do I call keydown() but also pass the event saying that keyCode/which 13 was pressed?
[17:21:16] <Gazpacho> innociv: keydown doesn't generate an event, it sets a handler for one
[17:21:50] <stan_man_can> Gazpacho maybe you can help with mine above? Looks like shoky disappeared
[17:24:34] <innociv_> gazpacho, you can pass an event, no? Because tha'ts what I'm asiking
[17:24:39] <innociv_> I want to fire the event and pass a key
[17:25:01] <Gazpacho> sorry stan i don't know
[17:25:28] <Gazpacho> innociv: instead of looking for a way to fire an event, just run the code that you would run for that key
[17:25:52] <innociv_> I don't want to :p
[17:25:58] <Gazpacho> then go away
[17:26:11] <innociv_> I want to pass a keydown event.
[17:26:20] <innociv_> The API doc says I can, but I see no explaination of how
[17:26:41] <Gazpacho> what doc says that
[17:26:54] <zissou> "then go away" hahaha
[17:30:43] <Gazpacho> $elements.trigger(new $.Event('keydown', { keyCode: 13 });
[17:31:47] <shoky> stan_man_can: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2v5Bt/2/
[17:32:57] <innociv_> gazpacho, jquery.com I think the url is
[17:33:11] <shoky> stan_man_can: or using the way i mentioned earlier.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2v5Bt/3/
[17:51:52] <relipse2> is it bad practice to add a function to jquery like so: $.dialogPrompt()
[17:52:37] <relipse2> the issue is it is not a normal plugin because it has no selectors
[18:00:46] <johnkpaul> relipse2: it seems unrelated to jquery
[18:01:19] <relipse2> um
[18:01:24] <relipse2> its directly related to jQuery
[18:01:42] <relipse2> $.foobar = function(){ blah }
[18:01:46] <relipse2> is that bad practice
[18:05:01] <zissou> where i come from, we have a saying. best not to invent hot water, meaning if you can find it in a framework or library which is standardized, use that. i think u can find the functionality u are looking for in jquery UI
[18:08:02] <relipse2> zissou: i used jquery ui --> http://jsfiddle.net/5yhmb/186/
[18:14:28] <innociv_> How do I call keydown() but also pass the event saying that keyCode/which 13 was pressed?
[18:14:47] <relipse2> keydown(event)
[18:14:49] <relipse2> i believe
[18:15:07] <zissou> relipse2, if it's not bad to use self invocating functions with function closures and i read on a couple of sites that it's perfectly fine.. then you have nothing to worry about when you use jquery ui
[18:15:42] <zissou> im sure those folks do their best to keep the crossbrowser compatibility top notch
[18:16:28] <zissou> if ur worried about bottlenecks, use firebug or webinspector's network panel
[18:16:31] <Gazpacho> innociv did you not see the code I gave you earlier
[18:20:10] <jrich> have a pretty basic question i think... reading a book and following some code... they are talking about event handlers
[18:20:42] <jrich> they define a textarea and call some events like,  $("#textarea").keyup(eventdata,OnKeyUp)
[18:20:50] <jrich> the eventdata is a key value set
[18:20:57] <voidpirate> continue
[18:21:02] <jrich> in the OnKeyUp(event)
[18:21:08] <jrich> they do this
[18:21:21] <jrich> var item = "#" + event.data.item
[18:21:46] <jrich> i understand that the event object contains the basic event stuff
[18:21:56] <jrich> but how did "eventdata" turn in to "data"?
[18:24:01] <Gazpacho> it was assigned
[18:24:52] <jrich> is event.data like a collection of args?
[18:26:05] <Gazpacho> it's the data that the code setting the event handler provided to be used by the callback
[18:26:20] <Gazpacho> it's the data that the code setting the event handler provided to be used by that handler
[18:27:04] <jrich> http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[18:27:08] <jrich> so in looking at that
[18:27:14] <jrich> i can only ever pass in one object
[18:27:29] <jrich> so if i have mutliple objects to pass in, i need to build a single object and pass it in?
[18:27:50] <jrich> .keyup( [eventData ], handler(eventObject) )
[18:27:53] <Gazpacho> no
[18:29:54] <shoky> jrich: you can pass an array too
[18:30:07] <shoky> or anything you want
[18:30:10] <jrich> right, an array is an object
[18:30:19] <jrich> but to say something like
[18:30:22] <shoky> not because of that
[18:30:30] <shoky> the docs for .keyup are misleading
[18:30:34] <jrich> .keyup(set1,set2,MyHandler)
[18:30:37] <shoky> it's just a shortcut for .on('keyup'
[18:30:45] <shoky> so look at the docs for .on() and its 'data' argument
[18:30:50] <jrich> k
[18:30:52] <shoky> there it says that it can be of any type
[18:31:19] <shoky> and yeah, you can't do set1,set2
[18:31:22] <shoky> only one data parameter
[18:31:38] <jrich> right
[18:31:50] <jrich> ok thats what i thought, just seemed weird
[18:31:56] <jrich> or rather, i didnt want to assume
[18:32:29] <jrich> is there a shorthand notation for the set1 set2 example?
[18:32:47] <jrich> .keyup( (set1,set2), MyHandler)
[18:32:51] <shoky> you can jus tpass an array with both of those..  [set1, set2]
[18:33:05] <jrich> is it normal index notion?
[18:33:10] <jrich> event.data[0]
[18:33:11] <jrich> ?
[18:33:15] <shoky> yep
[18:33:26] <jrich> im really new to this, i know C#/powershell extra so sorry for the basic questions
[18:33:30] <jrich> thanks
[18:33:38] <shoky> np
[18:35:23] <jrich> whats the name of the "event" object so i can check properties/methods?
[18:35:38] <johnkpaul> jrich: jQuery.Event?
[18:35:40] <shoky> you mean, in the docs?
[18:35:44] <jrich> yeah
[18:35:48] <jrich> hard to search for "event" :)
[18:36:06] <shoky> ?$.Event
[18:36:08] <bot-t> shoky, Event Object | jQuery API Documentation - jQuerys event system normalizes the event object according to W3C standards . The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied ov... http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[18:36:24] <jrich> thanks
[18:40:34] <Gazpacho> you can set as many pairs of handler & data on an event as you like and they will each be called when the event fires
[18:41:09] <jrich> thanks
[18:41:22] <jrich> i've gotten spoiled by powershell, so nice to inspect on the fly :)
[18:49:49] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:50:03] <lenswipe> can I pass a JSON object to the data: parameter in $.ajax?
[18:50:44] <imsky> ues
[18:51:27] <lenswipe> interesting
[19:29:17] <d0100_> so, when sending data trought $.ajax as POST, the post data nevers gets to the php script
[19:29:36] <d0100_> printing $_POST gives me an empty array
[19:32:45] <d0100_> ah, found the culprit: contentType: "application/json"
[19:32:53] <d0100_> removed and now it works
[20:28:19] <bobbobbins> hey, i have a radio button as a var named this_question and I want to set the selected value, how would i do that…I tried to look it up, but i only see how to do it if you do $("input[name='mygroup'][value='5']"), not if you have it actually stored as a var as in my case...
[20:31:01] <Albright> I'm trying to do a fadeOut effect on some elements with a "complete" callback, but the callback is being called immediately, not when the animation completes. What could be causing that?
