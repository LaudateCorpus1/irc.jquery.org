[01:59:21] <johan-hedin> https://3v4l.org/Y4Jjc#output here i have json which i want to convert in this structure http://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/examples/evolution-tree/example6.js  specifc nodeStructure  { }
[01:59:35] <johan-hedin> any idea how we can do in jquery or javascript ?
[01:59:57] <johan-hedin> as i am not from nested set model left right key which is parent and which is child
[02:00:37] <johan-hedin> As i am not **getting
[03:10:08] <Cork> johan-hedin: you would have to provide more info on how they are suppose to map
[03:10:25] <Cork> (also i recommend starting with a jsfiddle and see how far you can get)
[03:18:41] <johan-hedin> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/7zepb1gb/ this is my sample json and i want this structure http://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/examples/evolution-tree/example6.js  specifc nodeStructure  { }
[03:19:03] <johan-hedin> i am just looking at parent chaild
[03:19:19] <Cork> yes i know you want it in a different structure
[03:19:30] <Cork> but how does it map, i can't see any resemblance at all
[03:22:27] <johan-hedin> Cork: cant we get which is child ? and which is aprent with left right ?
[03:23:35] <johan-hedin> Cork: have some record in database same like  http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/#amzn_assoc_ad_div_adunit0_0
[03:44:24] <johan-hedin> Cork: what you suggest then ...
[04:34:26] <Mati_> Hello
[05:12:37] <rbo> Hi there, I am trying to get this code to work... https://gist.github.com/cocoabro/1704334f5470465e8ed4b52a886726a9, not sure what I am missing...
[05:12:49] <rbo> It's telling me unexpected error on the last }.
[05:20:03] <Cork> rbo: line 25 and on is broken
[05:20:30] <Cork> ah, no it isn't
[05:21:08] <Cork> thought about using descriptive variable names? :/
[05:21:27] <rbo> yes, sorry, I am just trying to test it out.
[05:21:42] <rbo> next time I will, basically it's supposed to be an incoming webhook into a slack channel..
[05:22:05] <Cork> from what i can tell r should be undefined on line 13
[05:22:28] <Cork> rbo: try making a demo in jsfiddle.net
[05:22:47] <rbo> k
[05:30:12] <rbo> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/2dqd3tyg/1/
[05:31:37] <rbo> thank you for your help too :)
[05:35:02] <rbo> Cork if not, I found some videos :D
[05:41:44] <Cork> that isn't really what i was asking for at all

[09:45:40] <philwire> hi
[11:05:23] <johan-hedin> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47078362/php-javascript-json-data-should-not-have-key-value-in-numeric-and-not-coming-as
[11:07:36] <taplar> so $tree[$key] is putting the number key in there
[13:47:26] <jak2000> hi all
[13:49:53] <robertmaxrees> morning
[13:50:44] <taplar> ey, rob is back
[13:51:07] <jak2000> friends....
[13:51:40] <jak2000> anyone have free time for help me? i can send dollars (not much i am poor but i try).... or recommend me one? thanks
[13:52:59] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 no money here buddy :)
[14:00:01] <jak2000> robertmaxrees thanks: remember this table edit plugin: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples i need integrate with this: https://codepen.io/ajkochanowicz/pen/KHdih   <--- but this work with 3 tables (static header, static rows, and others).....
[14:01:42] <robertmaxrees> i really don't hahahaha
[14:02:15] <robertmaxrees> so you want fixed headers with that edit plugin?
[14:03:17] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[14:04:43] <jak2000> yes i want this...
[14:05:05] <jak2000> ok, i create a fiddle, but at night.... and share here, thanks...
[14:05:05] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?  looks like tabledit leaves the core table markup in place.
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:05:23] <jak2000> and other thing.... of table.edit plugin...
[14:06:24] <robertmaxrees> awww taplar left
[14:06:39] <jak2000> yes :(
[14:06:49] <robertmaxrees> what was your question?
[14:06:53] <jak2000> robertmaxrees can you see second sample: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples   ?
[14:07:04] <jak2000> see this: editable: [[1, 'car'], [2, 'color', '{"1": "Red", "2": "Green", "3": "Blue"}']]    ?
[14:07:20] <robertmaxrees> aye
[14:08:24] <jak2000> the select display Red Grren Blue
[14:08:41] <jak2000> my  problem with plugin is that show up the options unsorted....
[14:08:58] <jak2000> or sorted by the index.....   and i need sort by name..
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> well.
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> so they're sorted by the order if the array you feed it.
[14:12:14] <robertmaxrees> and with arrays, index matters.
[14:12:21] <robertmaxrees> so you need to feed it the order you want.
[14:14:01] <jak2000> yes.... but is hard.... because, you know: a catalog..... have id and name.....   1, Robert   2, Jak   3, Smith      ...
[14:14:03] <jak2000> understand me?
[14:14:10] <robertmaxrees> why is that hard?
[14:14:17] <jak2000> and i need the id for join the data....
[14:14:35] <robertmaxrees> this data is stored in a DB, right?
[14:14:40] <jak2000> yes
[14:14:56] <robertmaxrees> soooo why not have the DB give you things in the order you want?
[14:15:48] <jak2000> you mean: select * from mytable order by name ?    and fill the Array:
[14:16:38] <jak2000> editable: [[1, 'Id'], [2, 'name', '{"2": "Jak", "1": "Robert", "3": "Smith"}']]    ?
[14:17:02] <jak2000> testing, but i i am not, bad, the plugin again order by index....
[14:17:06] * jak2000 checking
[14:18:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:18:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:18:59] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating.
[14:21:07] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes checked
[14:21:51] <jak2000> plugin sort with id....(tested).... this not work: editable: [[1, 'Id'], [2, 'name', '{"2": "Jak", "1": "Robert", "3": "Smith"}']]  <-------
[14:22:03] <robertmaxrees> lol super unreadable when you do that.
[14:22:18] <jak2000> robertmaxrees escuse me,
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> so you want to be able to sort by different fields?
[14:23:05] <jak2000> if i fill the array: [2, 'name', '{"2": "Jak", "1": "Robert", "3": "Smith"}']   when edit display in this order: Robert, Jak, Smith  :(
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> reread my last question.
[14:23:21] <jak2000> yes able for sort in the second field(name in this case)...
[14:24:07] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> so you want to be able to sort by different fields?   <----- yes
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> it sounds more and more like this isn't the plugin you want then.
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> and/or you'll need to setup that up manually yourself.
[14:25:47] <jak2000> taplar helped with some things.. but him havent time... and i haven knowleadge ... :(
[14:25:53] <jak2000> *havent
[14:25:55] <robertmaxrees> great time to learn then!
[14:28:41] <jak2000> ok :)
[14:42:34] <robertmaxrees> taplar did i tell you were i was headed>?
[14:48:42] <taplar> i don't think so?
[14:48:55] <robertmaxrees> went to google NY for the day on Monday
[14:49:20] <taplar> oh nice
[14:50:01] <taplar> wait, a google hq in ny?
[14:50:48] <taplar> ooooh, you interested in applying?
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> nah.  was for a mobile hack day/.
[20:26:30] <SideFX> I just var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(msg);
[20:26:34] <SideFX> Did that
[20:26:54] <SideFX> That msg is a json encoded array, how can I cycle through obj like a foreach?
[20:36:54] <shoky> SideFX: if it's an array,  .forEach()
[20:37:54] <shoky> there's no reason to use jQuery.parseJSON really
[20:38:18] <shoky> i see they deprecated it too
[20:43:03] <SideFX> What should I use?
[21:10:02] <shoky> JSON.parse()
