[01:38:30] <ryan_ford> in jq3+ what is the `on` binding for the `ready` event? `DOMContentLoaded`?
[01:40:42] <ryan_ford> seems like in 1.11.1 you could use `on('ready', cb)`
[03:22:21] <Cork> ryan_ford: it is actually a hook that runs a little earlier
[03:22:47] <Cork> ah, and ready doesn't have a coresponding event name
[03:23:01] <Cork> (also $(document).ready is depricated use $(function() {})
[03:26:40] <ryan_ford> is that the best practice now?
[03:26:55] <ryan_ford> I'm trying to learn idiomatic jQ
[03:26:59] <Cork> ryan_ford: the old method was depricated, aka it is about to be removed
[03:27:10] <Cork> $(function() {}) isn't
[03:28:15] <ryan_ford> it's certainly cleaner
[03:28:56] <Cork> ryan_ford: also you want to read https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/ready.js
[03:30:33] <ryan_ford> hmm interesting
[03:32:33] <ryan_ford> so I've been including jQ in the header with a defer attribute, I'm guess I should *not* be doing that?
[03:32:52] <Cork> ryan_ford: you will miss the domcontentloaded event ya
[03:33:19] <ryan_ford> thanks for the heads up
[03:33:40] <Cork> ryan_ford: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3025
[03:33:48] <Cork> seams like the deprication was moved to 3.1
[03:34:02] <Cork> (still deprecated though)
[03:37:37] <Cork> jak2000: seriously, just think a little, it is simple math
[03:40:16] <ryan_ford> this is where I saw the other way https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[03:40:34] <ryan_ford> > Experienced developers sometimes use the shorthand $() for $( document ).ready(). If you are writing code that people who aren't experienced with jQuery may see, it's best to use the long form.
[03:41:21] <Cork> interesting... they are giving contradictionally signals aren't they...
[03:41:59] <Cork> ryan_ford: i saw the deprecation notification in a blogpost for 3.<somehting> but can't find it now so they might have reverted on that decision
[03:42:00] <ryan_ford> seems that way, , although that's not been updated since 01/2017 fwiw
[03:56:20] <Woet> Cork: "just think a little" actually solves 80% of the questions here
[03:57:24] <ryan_ford> 🙄
[03:57:33] <Uhkis> Woet: why would anyone think when they can make others do stuff for them
[03:58:22] <Woet> Uhkis: just scroll up to "tilerendering"
[03:58:33] <Woet> tldr; [18:19:00]  <tilerendering>	I jsut need an answer to what I asked for.
[03:59:28] <ryan_ford> no one was in the right in that convo
[03:59:33] <ryan_ford> imo
[04:00:50] <Woet> i mean, i literally never used it before and figured it out after 3 minutes
[04:01:05] <Woet> look at documentation -> copy paste code -> it works
[04:01:24] <Woet> so they never actually tried
[04:02:56] <Uhkis> Woet: now replace think with try from my previous comment ;)
[04:09:12] <ryan_ford> Cork: If I'm not using those jQ pre-DCL lifecycle hooks, maybe I'm better to leave defer on, no?
[04:14:47] <ryan_ford> ah nvm, that would be assuming no one else needs the hooks in the future 🙈
[04:27:25] <Cork> ryan_ford: there is a few other parts that becomes hairy too
[04:27:43] <Cork> ryan_ford: like every plugin or script that depends on jquery has to be deferred for them to work
[04:28:10] <Cork> ryan_ford: why jquery normally shouldn't be deferred is cause it doesn't do anything on its own, its a utility framework
[04:32:19] <ryan_ford> yeah, makes sense, bummer
[04:35:30] <Cork> ryan_ford: also if you load jquery from a cdn it most likely exists in the browsers cache, so defer normally doesn't gain you that much
[05:21:54] <silv3r_m00n> hi
[05:22:26] <silv3r_m00n> i have a dialog with add row button and remove button next to each row, but the remove button is not working as expected. this is the code, https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/SCm3MtDyPs/   only the first row gets removed clicking on any remove button
[05:22:31] <silv3r_m00n> why is that so ?
[05:22:38] <silv3r_m00n> doest each work like a loop ?
[05:23:35] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: though that should work as long as you don't add new rows, you shouldn't do it that way
[05:23:40] <Cork> use delegated event handlers
[05:24:14] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: i am adding more rows using a add row button, but later on pressing remove row next to any button remove only one of the rows that were initially present
[05:24:23] <Cork> dialog.on('click', '.row .remove', function() { $(this).closest('.row').remove(); })
[05:24:37] <silv3r_m00n> yes, now i am using closest check inside and it works as needed
[05:24:54] <silv3r_m00n> but i want to understand whats wrong with the earlier approach, i have misunderstood something
[05:24:59] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: ya, cause the event handler doesn't exist, as you add it directly on each button
[05:25:46] <Cork> the code i gave you adds one event handler to the dialog and it handles all rows (including future ones) as it listens for bubbling events
[05:25:57] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: the event handler is there, pressing the remove button on a newly added row does trigger it, but it removes the first row instead
[05:26:07] <Cork> while the way you did it only handles the rows that existed when this code ran
[05:26:14] <silv3r_m00n> var newRow = $(ul).clone(true);
[05:26:37] <silv3r_m00n> i guess it has something to do with the context binding
[05:26:42] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: too much context is missing to answer that
[05:26:51] <silv3r_m00n> one sec
[05:26:52] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: try to make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[05:27:00] <Cork> not static code dumps
[05:27:33] <silv3r_m00n> this is all of it https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/mYN9NCzFXz/
[05:27:38] <Cork> see above
[05:28:00] <silv3r_m00n> ok one sec
[05:30:05] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: here it is, https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/158857/   click add criteria a few times, then click the last remove button and it would remove the first row, you can figure that out by typing something in the last row
[05:31:10] <silv3r_m00n> i think it has something to do with each and variable binding inside each handler
[05:31:14] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: you deep clone the old element with there event handlers
[05:31:27] <Cork> including its variable referece to the first element
[05:31:51] <silv3r_m00n> ohhhh
[05:32:14] <Cork> as you bind it through row = $(); ... .find()... row.remove()
[05:32:41] <Cork> so the click handler doesn't check relative to the element it fired on, but to the row it was originally created on
[05:33:05] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: again, use delegated event handlers to (and skip the deep clone) and this problem should go away
[05:33:29] <silv3r_m00n> yeah, already done that, with closest its working as expected. the previous thing actually confused me
[05:34:15] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: ya, but don't forget the delegation
[05:34:23] <Cork> it is actually the important part
[05:34:43] <silv3r_m00n> you mean .on thing instead of click( thing ?
[05:34:53] <Cork> no
[05:34:57] <silv3r_m00n> then ?
[05:35:02] <Cork> on with a selector as the second argument
[05:35:48] <silv3r_m00n> hang on, what was that
[05:36:46] <silv3r_m00n> hmm, dialog.on('click', '.row .remove', function() { ... so the selector is the 2nd argument ? what does this actually do ? i am doing it like this https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/NB6cQfqXRS/
[05:36:53] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/158929/
[05:37:44] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: also i would prob recommend having a template for the row instead of cloning the first element
[05:38:09] <Cork> alternatively hide the remove button if it is the first row
[05:38:42] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: also read http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[05:38:52] <silv3r_m00n> i think i need to learn this new style of selecting things you showed in the fiddle
[05:38:57] <silv3r_m00n> there are 2 ons chained
[05:39:40] <Cork> ya, almost all jquery methods return the original jquery object
[05:39:43] <Cork> so you can chain them
[05:40:05] <Cork> $(this).on('click', func); $(this).on('click', func); is identical to $(this).on('click', func).on('click', func);
[05:40:44] <Cork> same for $(this).click(func).click(func); vs $(this).click(func); $(this).click(func); btw
[05:40:54] <silv3r_m00n> ok this delegation thing is cool, and got your on chaining thing as well
[05:41:15] <silv3r_m00n> i think i shall avoid the on chaining , since showing separately makes it more readable for beginners like me :D
[05:41:40] <silv3r_m00n> i remember using something called livequery years ago for this delegation aspect
[05:41:41] <hellyeah> is there a plugin in jquery for uploading file?
[05:41:43] <Cork> ya, the important part is to delegate the events, cause else it won't scale
[05:41:54] <silv3r_m00n> so that buttons added later on could respond
[05:42:00] <Cork> hellyeah: sure, but you don't really need it
[05:42:20] <Cork> just grab the form and give it to a formData object and you can ajax upload it
[05:42:37] <Cork> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[05:42:40] <hellyeah> form data object
[05:42:46] <Cork> no formData
[05:42:47] <hellyeah> the?
[05:42:53] <hellyeah> they will upload excel file
[05:43:08] <hellyeah> still valid suggestion
[05:43:10] <hellyeah> ?
[05:43:25] <Cork> as long as you have a dom File object yes
[05:43:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:43:41] <Cork> if it is javascript generated data, not so much
[05:43:48] <hellyeah> dom file object hmm
[05:43:54] <hellyeah> i need to search for it
[05:44:03] <Cork> then it is better to just post the data and have the server treat the blob as a file
[05:44:11] <hellyeah> no this file will be filled manually
[05:44:16] <hellyeah> and upload the system
[05:44:25] <Cork> hellyeah: if you have a file picker in the form it covers it
[05:44:50] <hellyeah> file picker
[05:44:51] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:44:54] <Cork> ...
[05:45:16] <Cork> if they upload a file manually in a webpage there isn't really another way >_<
[05:45:31] <hellyeah> oh ok
[05:45:41] <hellyeah> i never did tthat before
[05:45:59] <Cork> you've never used an <input type="file"> ?
[05:48:27] <Cork> hellyeah: $.ajax(url, { processData: false, contentType: false, data: new FormData($('form')[0]) }).done(function() { alert('form uploaded'); });
[05:48:33] <Cork> that is basically what you need
[05:49:36] <Cork> damn forgot the type
[05:49:44] <Cork> hellyeah: $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', processData: false, contentType: false, data: new FormData($('form')[0]) }).done(function() { alert('form uploaded'); });
[05:49:58] <hellyeah> Cork,  honestly no
[05:50:09] <Cork> what?
[05:50:14] <hellyeah> i mean
[05:50:21] <hellyeah> i didnt use input type=file
[05:50:24] <hellyeah> sorry :D
[05:50:33] <Cork> wow, ok nows the time then
[05:50:45] <hellyeah> ehe ok
[05:51:23] <hellyeah> what if i want to give user start uploading, cancel uploading and download button
[05:51:25] <Cork> hellyeah: btw if you don't need to use ajax for uploading the file, you might not even need to do anything
[05:51:31] <hellyeah> i need something different i guess
[05:51:37] <Cork> download has nothing to do with this
[05:51:45] <Cork> that is server logic
[05:52:10] <hellyeah> right
[05:52:22] <hellyeah> what about start upload, cancel upload
[05:52:30] <Cork> cancel well, if you just do a straight post (no ajax) the user can just hit the stop button in the browser
[05:52:37] <hellyeah> i dont need to use ajax for uploading file correct
[05:52:47] <Cork> if you use ajax you need to store the xhr object from $.ajax and call .abort() on it
[05:53:01] <hellyeah> if i use ajax
[05:53:09] <hellyeah> i have to close sql connection i assume
[05:53:15] <Cork> hellyeah: if you don't need ajax, you don't need any client code at all
[05:53:26] <Cork> hellyeah: that again is server code
[05:53:31] <hellyeah> yeah
[05:53:33] <hellyeah> btw
[05:53:33] <Cork> js shouldn't care about what you do server side
[05:53:40] <Cork> and have no control over it event
[05:53:43] <Cork> -t
[05:53:45] <hellyeah> there wont be any ajax when uploading file
[05:53:54] <Cork> then you just need a form, no js
[05:54:08] <hellyeah> but ajax for communicating backend
[05:54:11] <hellyeah> that is all
[05:54:16] <hellyeah> the rest is server side
[05:54:20] <Cork> uh
[05:54:27] <hellyeah> what?
[05:54:38] <hellyeah> something wrong?
[05:54:39] <Cork> if you don't upload with ajax, you don't have any ajax communication while uploading
[05:54:57] <hellyeah> that is correct
[05:55:18] <hellyeah> but when user upload the file i need to download it when uploading is finished
[05:55:30] <hellyeah> how can i trace it?
[05:55:49] <Cork> then the result page for the upload is loading you can have a download link in it
[05:55:54] <hellyeah> i need too understand when uploading is finished
[05:56:05] <hellyeah> yeah it is like that
[05:56:11] <hellyeah> there will be a download button
[05:56:25] <hellyeah> when uploading is finished, download button will be enabled
[05:56:39] <hellyeah> if it is possible i need to maintain automatic download
[05:57:05] <hellyeah> so when uploading is finished, i will connect with backend and that will download the file
[05:57:18] <hellyeah> i cannot tell javascript to download file to some place right?
[05:57:40] <hellyeah> i may be confused
[05:58:20] <hellyeah> anyway lunch time for me
[05:58:29] <hellyeah> i need to search for it
[05:58:32] <hellyeah> thanks Cork
[06:03:07] <tilerendering> hola
[06:03:23] <Cork> hellyeah: you can trigger it yes, you can click the button, or you can event send the file as a response to the upload
[06:03:40] <Cork> hellyeah: but if the user picks the file from disk, i'm not sure why they need to be sent the file again
[06:14:28] <hellyeah> last part of this application is to write content of file to database
[06:15:06] <hellyeah> the fill the file save it and upload it. That file will be downloaded some place and content of file will be written to db
[06:21:47] <tilerendering> is anybody here well acquainted with the jquery validation plugin?
[06:22:42] <Woet> tilerendering: definitely, someone asked a question about it yesterday and after reading the documentation for a few minutes I figured it out.
[06:22:51] <Woet> :)
[06:38:58] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: hi, should be just use event delegation everywhere instead of normal click( assignments ?
[06:39:33] <hellyeah> okey i see now
[06:39:39] <hellyeah> javascript has FileReader
[06:40:03] <hellyeah> i am gonna read the file and store in value of element for example
[06:40:07] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: i mean, even if elements wont be added later on
[06:40:08] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[06:40:43] <hellyeah> silv3r_m00n,  https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[06:44:29] <tilerendering> oh man. here, this is my summary of “programming” in javascript… and it is a sad summary. I ve never been confronted with anything like this. https://pastebin.com/6i4hKDeR
[06:47:32] <preference> tilerendering: because students making open-source libraries is ineffective for creating consistent systems which have to be used large-scale when the students have to get a job and can't continue updating plugin 30094
[06:49:08] <tilerendering> preference: well there are a whole lot of open source projects in the java world too, postgresql is open source. it works like a charm.
[06:49:33] <preference> postgresql is huge
[06:49:39] <preference> i'm sure jquery won't fall out of fashion for a long time, either
[06:50:10] <tilerendering> I mean literally: when I set values programmatically in a form, it wont behave the same way it does when I enter the values manually. the state management behind this mechanism is not transparent though, nor documented. but what good is the “official” (!!!!!) jquery validation plugin of choice, if I cant programmatically populate a form with values resulting from an ajax call for instance?
[06:50:14] <preference> but the volatility of web development (due to many factors e.g. browsers, OSes, different languages) makes it difficult for small plugins to stay relevant and their developers/maintainers to stay focussed
[06:51:01] <tilerendering> and one would think: googling for it would solve the problem.
[06:51:02] <tilerendering> no way.
[06:51:04] <preference> also, there's a huge financial incentive to working in java for actual software development
[06:51:16] <tilerendering> oh my. I just need this validation to work.
[06:51:29] <preference> good luck, afraid i can't help you there
[06:51:34] <tilerendering> for the future, I will not rely on anything in js that wasnt written by myself
[06:51:36] <preference> maybe there's a bug submission on git
[06:51:50] <tilerendering> preference: what do you think i ve been looking for for the last 2 hours...
[06:52:07] <tilerendering> I found one issue
[06:52:12] <preference> *shrugs*
[06:52:13] <tilerendering> it was marked as duplicate of another 3 issues
[06:52:17] <tilerendering> (lol, 3!)
[06:52:33] <tilerendering> and hwen I navigated to them, they were marked as solved, but not even closely a duplicate of the issue marked as duplicate
[06:53:15] <preference> i believe you
[06:55:36] <tilerendering> sigh…
[06:57:24] <tilerendering> ok, maybe a general question:
[07:07:21] <tilerendering> I found a workaround. finally.
[07:13:54] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: only if it will match a bigger set of elements, or if the element is dynamic (will come and go)
[07:14:11] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: there is no gain (and even loss) by adding every handle like that
[08:05:35] <Prideth> hello. I have a question. Will there be a newer jqueryui version? or is jquery.ui no longer maintained?
[08:06:43] <preference> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[08:06:50] <preference> 1 year, 7 months ago. looks pretty dead to me
[08:08:08] <Prideth> to me too. Do you know an alternative? (not angular, react because i use JAVA EE)
[08:08:42] <preference> no clue, sorry. maybe Cork or Woet know of one
[08:09:14] <Cork> jquery ui is maintained, but the wiki tends to not be :)
[08:09:33] <preference> ah
[08:10:44] <Cork> Prideth: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/graphs/code-frequency
[08:11:03] <Cork> sure it isn't the most active project out there but...
[08:11:22] <Prideth> ok will there be a new release?
[08:11:41] <Prideth> last release is from 2016
[08:11:42] <Cork> ui tends mostly to be updated when it is needed to not break cause of a new jquery version
[08:12:09] <Cork> i'm not following ui enough to tell what the plan is
[08:16:16] <ryan_ford> Cork: that's not really a good practice to rely on what the user may or may not have cached
[08:16:39] <ryan_ford> even for stuff that's super common like jQ or bootstrap
[08:16:45] <Cork> ryan_ford: for performance it actually is
[08:17:11] <Cork> a few frameworks are so big that you can count on it existing in the browsers cache
[08:17:19] <ryan_ford> much better to optimize what's within your control
[08:17:24] <Cork> but ya, for normal script loading it is a bad idea
[08:17:50] <Cork> the problem is doing that for very common cdn frameworks will actually hurt performance
[08:18:23] <ryan_ford> but not critical performance
[08:18:28] <ryan_ford> like the first paint
[08:18:43] <Cork> it actaully can, depending on what tha page does
[08:18:45] <ryan_ford> and only the first load
[08:19:18] <ryan_ford> we're getting into a lot of what-ifs, I'd rather not use a cdn in production in the first place
[08:20:13] <Cork> it isn't what-ifs though, it is commonly accepted concepts for this problem
[08:20:46] <Cork> heck even browser makes refer to it
[08:22:03] <ryan_ford> what could you possibly lose by waiting until at least after the critical content (above the fold) renders before loading jQ?
[08:23:55] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: thanks
[08:50:29] <ryan_ford> if anyone is interested, I got the css variables working with jquery `$(document.documentElement)` when I upgraded from 3.1.1 to 3.3.1
[08:51:06] <ryan_ford> which is the version jsfiddle uses. must be fairly new
[08:57:39] <preference> CodeEater: ask your question here.
[09:21:51] <sujeet> Hi, I'm having a weird issue with the jQuery CDN. For some reason, I get a 301 loop if I try to do wget https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js from multiple computers and 2 different IPs in Australia. If I use an Australian VPN, same result. If I switch to an American VPN, then I can actually access the file.
[09:23:24] <silv3r_m00n> hi, i need to put some html as a template somewhere, which will be used by javascript to generate more content. this html will be inside the form area and have input fields, but should not submit with the form. what are my options ?
[09:23:39] <silv3r_m00n> should i encode the template in some way ?
[09:25:32] <ryan_ford> like you're going to accept html from the user that you're going to render?
[09:27:25] <silv3r_m00n> ryan_ford: similar to this, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[09:27:32] <silv3r_m00n> adding more rows to a set of rows
[09:28:56] <silv3r_m00n> but that template tag is not supported in ie 11 i guess
[09:30:38] <ryan_ford> why not just use jquery and convert strings to html?
[09:33:02] <ryan_ford> I've only really used templates with vuejs, they use it for conditional content. but if you're already using jQ, it would be just as easy (easier) to just manipulate a string representation imo
[09:33:37] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: the recommended solution is to have a <script type="text/template"></script> with the html in it
[09:34:07] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: was reading a stackoverflow answer on that, so is text/template a standard feature or work around ?
[09:34:13] <Cork> then you set an id on the template and do $($.parseHTML($('#the-id').html()))
[09:34:44] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: the standard feature is <template> but it isn't supported in all browsers and gets parsed as part of the dom in those that don't support it
[09:35:11] <silv3r_m00n> if there are input tags inside text/template will they get submitted with the form ?
[09:35:18] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: so until it is fully supported in all browsers the script solution is the best solution, and isn't invalid, though not strictly standard
[09:35:34] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: the content of <script> tags isn't parsed by the dom parser
[09:35:39] <Cork> it is just a long string
[09:35:50] <Cork> and is why you need to do $($.parseHTML($('#the-id').html()))
[09:36:05] <silv3r_m00n> if i put the whole template in a variable inside a javascript tag, like var template = <?php json_encode .... ?
[09:36:06] <Cork> (notice the $.parseHTML($().html()) part)
[09:36:23] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: no it shouldn't be json
[09:36:26] <Cork> just normal html
[09:36:39] <silv3r_m00n> i mean for a js variable
[09:36:51] <Cork> it is better to put it in a script tag
[09:37:16] <silv3r_m00n> <script>   var template = <?php echo json_encode($html_content); ?>; </script>
[09:37:33] <Cork> you should avoid generating javascript with server script
[09:37:37] <Cork> keep the javascript static
[09:38:00] <Cork> makes debugging easier, and means the jit has a better chance
[09:38:40] <Cork> with what you wrote there you will constantly keep the script tag in the dom, AND constantly keep a javascript variable around with the same content
[09:39:09] <Cork> so just keep the html in a normal script tag (meaning you don't need to string escape the html) and then just fetch it when you need it
[09:39:37] <Cork> it results in by far the most manageable templates with the least resource costs
[09:39:56] <Cork> (as you don't need to special handle the template, it is just html)
[09:44:30] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: hmm, actually i was thinking of putting all templates in a global array , that could be accessed by the ui generator function in ui.js
[09:45:00] <silv3r_m00n> the index of the array would guide which template to use
[09:46:05] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: a quick example https://jsfiddle.net/nyk3mtck/5/
[09:46:23] <Cork> that is the solution i would recommend
[09:47:17] <Cork> storing templates in javascript both takes up more ram (as it needs to be stored twice, AND be string escaped)
[09:47:25] <Cork> and harder to edit
[09:50:38] <ryan_ford> man, I need to lurk more. I'm learning so much about browser support hacks and low performance tricks since starting jquery it's nuts
[09:54:32] <bomb> i need to quit javascript altogether
[09:55:46] <ryan_ford> 😂
[10:28:20] <Levin^> good morning
[10:28:32] <preference> o/
[11:33:00] <freetlas> Hey guys. I've got this legacy code I'm trying to update to jQuery 3.3.1. It is a 10 lines code. I'm almost done but it hasn't worked yet. https://pastebin.com/raw/7kBfPM8A
[11:33:30] <freetlas> I think it is because jQuery 3.3.1 doesn't take values from an input like I was doing before. Any help? Thanks!
[11:37:05] <shoky> freetlas: those both do the same thing.. and both should work fine with any jquery
[11:38:21] <freetlas> shoky: It isn't :/
[11:39:19] <shoky> freetlas: then you have a different issue. also "doesn't work" isn't very helpful
[11:54:24] <freetlas> shoky: This is the error I'm getting http://pastebin.com/raw/k3scBvfL
[11:54:48] <freetlas> It says item is undefined. The only reason it can be undefined it is because jQuer ain't taking the right value
[11:57:52] <freetlas> join #nodejs
[13:57:51] <vish93> hey guys if I have an array like: [{"id":"KRL722BIPZR","value":2750,"quantity":"1"},{"id":"KRL722BIPWZ","value":2750,"quantity":"1"}] how can I can check if say KRL722BIPZR exists?
[13:58:11] <robertmaxrees> array.some()
[14:00:32] <robertmaxrees> vish93 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[14:02:03] <vish93> Thanks robertmaxrees
[14:14:28] <vish93> robertmaxrees: can’t get the some to work with the array of objects.
[14:15:21] <taplar> share your attempt?
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:15:56] <robertmaxrees> hard for us to help if we don't know what you tried.
[14:19:57] <vish93> robertBusy: Ever so sorry https://pastebin.com/FcKyEH4e
[14:20:21] <vish93> trying to see if object with x id is in array if so update else add new object to array
[14:20:38] <taplar> I don't see your implementation of some() any where
[14:21:41] <taplar> and line 5 is using variables I don't see declared any where
[14:25:33] <vish93> taplar removed the some function. I don’t think it may be the way to go.
[14:38:57] <vish93> Got it https://pastebin.com/hUbt9wtk
[14:41:58] <taplar> uh, wait, are you just trying to find the element that matches the id?
[14:45:14] <taplar2> https://jsfiddle.net/xm2hLy41/1/  you don't need to write the loop, you can use find() for this
[14:45:21] <taplar2> not sure if that got through with my disconnect
[14:46:57] <ryan_ford> it did. nice solution
[14:49:12] <ryan_ford> no ie support though, if that's important
[14:49:43] <taplar> ah, true
[14:50:12] * taplar starts digging into the jquery utility methods
[14:50:58] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[14:51:15] <shoky> or better yet, .filter :P
[14:52:05] <taplar> very true.  i need to bookmark the mdn site.  i google search stuff on it a lot
[14:52:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xm2hLy41/3/
[14:52:45] <ryan_ford> try devdocs.io
[14:52:50] <ryan_ford> amazing resource
[14:53:51] <taplar> i'll take a look, but for what i usually use mdn for, i could probably just bookmark caniuse.com
[14:54:16] <ryan_ford> devdocs has mdn docs for html/css/js
[14:54:33] <ryan_ford> super easy search, and you can save for offline use even
[14:54:58] <ryan_ford> once you use it, you will see the light
[14:55:19] <ryan_ford> everything in one place
[14:55:46] <taplar> interesting
[15:03:35] <vish93> taplar: I have currently got https://pastebin.com/vykYfD1X but will try your filter way out :)
[15:04:11] <taplar> it's just a little less typing on your part.  less wheel recreation
[15:06:00] <vish93> I appreciate the help :) is there a good way to replace to the object in the array or would I have to loop ?
[15:07:36] <taplar> The entire object?
[15:12:42] <vish93> just a specific property value
[15:13:02] <taplar> then you can just change the object
[15:13:30] <taplar> the filter is returning the same element that is in the array
[15:13:52] <taplar> this works, provided the elements are objects
[15:14:20] <vish93> taplar, aye Iv’e done that bit, but cannot firgure out pushing the object into the array again with the updated version
[15:14:46] <taplar> you don't have to, that's what i'm saying
[15:14:52] <taplar> it's the same object in both places
[15:15:27] <taplar> both your filter reference to the object, and the position it exists in the array, both point to the same location in memory
[15:15:43] <taplar> changing a nested value of that object affects both
[15:17:16] <vish93> YOU BEAUTY!!! I owe you a nice cold beer :)
[15:17:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xm2hLy41/6/
[15:19:08] <ryan_ford> so element is a regular object, not a jq object?
[15:19:46] <taplar> in this case, ya
[16:08:02] <randommatt123> Anyone else notice the jQuery CDN has an invalid SSL cert?
[16:08:47] <vish93> taplar: is this var removeIndex = apps.map(function(item) { return item.id; }).indexOf(37);
[16:08:47] <vish93> / remove object
[16:08:48] <vish93> apps.splice(removeIndex, 1); a good way to remove from the array?
[16:09:11] <taplar> that will affect only apps, but sure
[16:11:13] <taplar> randommatt123: that's interesting, you might point that out in one of the dev or other chatrooms
[16:11:36] <taplar> #jquery-dev
[16:11:42] <randommatt123> Will do
[16:15:38] <k0nichiwa> im getting Failed to load resource: The certificate for this server is invali
[16:15:56] <k0nichiwa> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js
[16:16:07] <taplar> yeah, there's some cert issue right now.
[16:16:08] <k0nichiwa> is that the wrong url ti include jquery from ?
[16:16:12] <k0nichiwa> wow
[16:16:19] <k0nichiwa> the entire internet is going to be down
[16:16:26] <k0nichiwa> a lot of people load jquery from there id think
[16:16:31] <taplar> nah, lots of sites host jquery locally
[16:16:31] <k0nichiwa> is there another place to link it from ?
[16:16:37] <taplar> google cdn has it as well
[16:16:43] <k0nichiwa> ok
[16:18:19] <k0nichiwa> taplar, do they host the UI css also ?
[16:18:23] <dmchale> assuming people are working on it if people here talking about it, yes?
[16:18:26] <taplar> i believe so
[16:18:45] <taplar> dmchale: not sure if the devs keep an eye out in here or not
[16:19:21] <k0nichiwa> i found oit
[16:20:17] <taplar> yeah, when i use the cdn i usually use the google one.  not cause the jquery one is bad really, just i figure google has more servers to serve up the files, :P
[16:20:27] <dmchale> k thanks, taplar. this is kind of a Bad Thing for all my client sites atm, just came here looking to see what status I can give the people answering the phones here :)
[16:20:38] <dmchale> yeah i don't disagree
[16:21:01] <FinchDes> Is anyone else having issues with the https://code.jquery.com/ not loading.  Because of an SSL error NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
[16:21:17] <taplar> yeah, there's some cert issue currently
[16:21:19] <randommatt123> Yep FinchDes its happening to everyone
[16:22:13] <FinchDes> Thanks for the info.
[16:23:40] <FinchDes> Does anyone have experience with this in the past and an idea of the what to expect with the issue being addressed and resolved?
[16:24:33] <taplar> I've seen cert issues happen before and they were resolved while we were talking about them.  It wasn't that long, but I have no guarantee about how quick they will be.
[16:26:19] <plsuh> hello, is anyone seeing a certificate error for code.jquery.com?
[16:26:58] <FinchDes> Thanks Taplar.  This is affecting all of my client's sites and I'm just trying to figure out if I need to find a work around or sit it out.  I guess I'll sit it out for now.
[16:27:29] <taplar> yep, the site is having an issue currently
[16:27:45] <plsuh> thx -- just making sure it's not just me
[16:29:10] <k0nichiwa> just switch to linking it form google
[16:29:17] <k0nichiwa> google is neve rlikely to have certification problems
[16:29:45] <k0nichiwa> 's what i just did
[16:30:26] <taplar> yeah, that is an option for anyone who would like a secondary option.  https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/
[16:31:26] <taplar> however it should be noted though that if your application relies on jQuery for critical functionality, you might want to host the library yourself.
[16:32:58] <webadvanced> Anyone noted yet that https://code.jquery.com has an invalid cert (which breaks sites loading items like https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js )?
[16:33:18] <taplar> yep
[16:33:38] <robertBusy> anybody submit to the cdn github?
[16:34:29] <robertamxrees> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues doesn't look like it.
[16:34:53] <taplar> i was fixing to ask if there was a repo specific to the cdn
[16:35:00] <robertamxrees>  :)
[16:35:04] <robertamxrees> that's the one.
[16:35:51] <taplar> i can pop one in
[16:35:53] <webadvanced> I'm entering an issue now
[16:36:08] <robertamxrees> thank you :)
[16:36:30] <taplar> just did one
[16:37:38] <nuke0064> are we talking about the lapsed SSL?
[16:37:57] <taplar> whatever the issue is, yeah
[16:38:00] <robertamxrees> is that the error you're seeing for code.jquery.com ?
[16:38:26] <plsuh> It's not a lapsed cert, it's a cert with the wrong name
[16:38:32] <webadvanced> SSL is not lapsed, its showing a cert for *.ssl.hwcdn.net, ssl.hwcdn.net
[16:38:34] <ngharo> CN=*.ssl.hwcdn.net
[16:40:37] <nuke0064> that will do it. Sounds like a wildcard ssl cert gone wrong. I'm not an expert though, could be an SAN cert
[16:41:40] <plsuh> looks like the CDN doesn't have the correct cert configured and is returning a default wildcard cert
[16:42:04] <internetuser1002> hello
[16:42:21] <internetuser1002> I'm getting a SSL certificate error on https://code.jquery.com/
[16:42:21] <robertamxrees> hello
[16:42:25] <robertamxrees> lol
[16:42:27] <robertamxrees> yep :)
[16:42:48] <JohnR> What's going on with jquery-latest.min.js?
[16:42:50] <robertamxrees> taplar did you open that ticket for the cdn?
[16:43:00] <randommatt123> SSL issue with the CDN JohnR
[16:43:16] <randommatt123> Everyone is running around on fire screamin about it heh, hopefully they fix it soon
[16:43:22] <taplar> yep, and someone just logged an opened thing in the dev chat
[16:43:31] <JohnR> When do you expect the error to be resolved? ...-ish?
[16:43:41] <taplar> [jquery] AlanWaiss opened issue #4050: Chrome and edge reporting an invalid certificate for code.jquery.com https://git.io/vptFF
[16:43:41] <taplar> so they're on it
[16:44:00] <robertamxrees> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/34 is the one in the right repo
[16:44:32] <robertamxrees> JohnR dunno yet.  i'm about to reach out to the contact i have in the org to get it resolved asap.
[16:45:14] <taplar> no one trusts an amx rees
[16:45:21] <JohnR> Alright. Thanks for the page info. I'll distribute it to our team. Any current workaround?
[16:45:22] <robertamxrees> hahahaha
[16:45:36] <taplar> just noticed it, lol
[16:45:38] <dbechrd> anyone know what's up with jquery SSL cert?
[16:45:51] <robertmaxrees> dbechrd https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/34
[16:45:53] <robertmaxrees> known issue.
[16:45:58] <taplar> you can use another cdn if possible.  google cdn hosts all jquery versions
[16:46:21] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/ is an alternative if that is a possibility for you
[16:46:25] <nuke0064> yeah was about to say that, (not sure if this is kosher here) but in a bind, you can use
[16:46:26] <nuke0064> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery
[16:47:03] <robertmaxrees> if you really can't wait, use another CDN.
[16:47:13] <JohnR> Could we use https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js instead?
[16:47:27] <taplar> *shrug* nothing bad about sharing cdns, imo
[16:47:28] <robertmaxrees> JohnR code.jquery.com is the problem.
[16:47:30] <randommatt123> Nah, code.jquery.com is the issue
[16:47:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:47:38] <bompus> This has probably already been covered, but anybody working on the code.jquery.com CDN SSL issue?
[16:47:47] <JohnR> Well...fuck.
[16:47:47] <bompus> and I think that is probably a yes based on the last 5 seconds haha :(
[16:47:53] <JohnR> Alright.
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> bompus lol we're already trying to get somebody on it :)
[16:48:12] <randommatt123> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4050#issuecomment-382875557 -- devs are aware
[16:48:23] <dbechrd> i think we're in the process of redeploying our site right now to use alternate cdn
[16:48:36] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[16:48:51] <taplar> :)
[16:49:05] <JohnR> So, you're saying that a fix will be in place between a few minutes from now to two weeks from now?
[16:49:19] <taplar> hosting locally is also always an option
[16:49:33] <dbechrd> yeah, we should've had a local fallback
[16:49:44] <JohnR> I wish we did that
[16:50:08] <taplar> neither of us are devs so we can't really give a timeline.  though robert eluded to contacting someone in the company
[16:50:24] <taplar> *are devs for jquery
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> they're already aware.
[16:50:49] <robertmaxrees> dave methvin replied to one of the gh issues.
[16:50:59] <robertmaxrees> which means it'll get handled asap.
[16:51:53] <JohnR> Alright. Thanks robertmaxrees. Sounds like we will just need to hang on, then.
[16:51:53] <taplar> should i have put the issue in there you think?  or close my other one?
[16:52:10] <dreamingbinary> here's the issue for reference: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4050
[16:53:54] <guz> Hello. Does anyone knows why the page https://code.jquery.com/ is showing and invalid certificate?
[16:54:15] <dreamingbinary> @guz https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/34
[16:55:04] <guz> ok. that's it thanks
[16:55:58] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's a CDN provider issue.
[16:57:50] <taplar> man, if ever there was a time for me to inflict a large number of people with some bad puns, now would be the time
[16:57:52] <ngharo> its fixed
[16:58:01] <robertmaxrees> awesome!
[16:58:04] <plsuh> oh goody
[16:58:25] <ngharo> welp, at command line it is, my browser still whacky. caching i suspect
[16:58:32] <k0nichiwa> datatables ... id like to be able to disable/reanble sorting dynamically
[16:58:45] <k0nichiwa> obviously if you pull your data from a database, you may have it already ordered
[16:59:02] <k0nichiwa> in fact multi-column orderd, which datatables doenst by default provide a UI to accomplish
[16:59:22] <k0nichiwa> so i want a button that enab'es/disables datatables own sorting
[16:59:28] <plsuh> @k0nichiwa, wrong channel?
[16:59:30] <taplar> i'm pretty sure sorting is configurable
[16:59:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:59:38] <k0nichiwa> datatables is a plugin
[16:59:55] <k0nichiwa> and yes thres an option at creation time but i dont see you can chage it via the api
[17:00:03] <k0nichiwa> you'd have to desroy and recreate the table
[17:00:09] <taplar> eeeeh
[17:00:19] <taplar> there should be something like DataTable(options)
[17:00:25] <taplar> i'd have to troll their site though
[17:00:29] <belak> What happened to code.jquery.com, out of curiosity?
[17:00:33] <k0nichiwa> yes sure ive found that
[17:00:40] <robertmaxrees> belak the CDN provider is having issues it looks leike.
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> *like
[17:00:54] <k0nichiwa> but in order to change sorting enablement you have to destroy the table and recreate it
[17:01:57] <randommatt123> SSL issue is fixed everyone
[17:01:59] <randommatt123> \p/
[17:02:26] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa did you try calling myTable.ordering(false) ?
[17:02:31] <robertmaxrees> err, .order(false)
[17:02:55] <taplar> woah, DT changed up their webpage major since the last time i was there
[17:03:12] <bompus> SSL still issue for me, must be propagating.
[17:03:27] <guz> Bravo!!
[17:04:02] <k0nichiwa> https://datatables.net/manual/tech-notes/3#destroy
[17:04:11] <k0nichiwa> pretty well explains it, u just recrate the object
[17:04:28] <webadvanced> They're using a Lets Encrypt cert now
[17:04:34] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa so did you try calling .order(false) ?
[17:04:46] <robertmaxrees> just out of pure curiosity.
[17:04:50] <robertmaxrees> their docs make it seem like that may work.
[17:04:57] <k0nichiwa> no ill try that
[17:04:59] <k0nichiwa> sec
[17:05:49] <k0nichiwa> didnt work
[17:06:20] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:06:35] <robertmaxrees> i might hit up their forums and see if somebody over there has any ideas.
[17:06:47] <k0nichiwa> do you have to wait for document read to begin using jquery ?
[17:06:55] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa depends.
[17:06:56] <k0nichiwa> under theory the scripts arent loaded until document ready
[17:07:03] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa huh?
[17:07:08] <k0nichiwa> yeah that didnt make sense
[17:07:11] <robertmaxrees> scripts can be loaded and run before document ready fires.
[17:07:43] <k0nichiwa> basically a script loaded after another can assume the prior scripts methods are available
[17:07:45] <nuke0064> thanks for the info pals, take care
[17:08:10] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa maybe.
[17:10:17] <Mikko123> anyone else get certificate error on jquery cdn?
[17:10:30] <robertmaxrees> Mikko123 yep - known issue, currently being resolved.

[17:15:22] <randommatt123> hah
[17:20:38] <taplar> fun day
[17:26:53] <taplar> potentially useful S.O. post for anyone who was affected: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1014203/best-way-to-use-googles-hosted-jquery-but-fall-back-to-my-hosted-library-on-go
[18:20:23] <freetlas> I'm trying to get the content of a <li> with jquery using the following: http://pastebin.com/raw/1RdJ8rS9 I'm pretty sure I'm getting but I'm getting text separated by hyphens "this-is-my-text"
[18:20:27] <freetlas> Any ideas?
[18:20:33] <freetlas> Maybe the regex?
[18:22:02] <taplar> $(this).text().replace(/ /g, "-");
[18:22:19] <robertmaxrees> ^ .replace() returns a new string.
[18:22:24] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't update in-place.
[18:22:32] <robertmaxrees> unless you don't care about that part.
[18:23:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/qncv3emj/1/ freetlas
[18:23:45] <freetlas> I don't care, but I'm getting "hello-bye" instead of "hellobye"
[18:23:51] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:23:57] <robertmaxrees> because that's what your replace is doing.
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> the second arg is "-"
[18:24:24] <freetlas> Mmm, got it! Thanks
[18:24:40] <freetlas> Why am I not getting that in the example you shared with me on jsfiddle?
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> you are.
[18:25:15] <robertmaxrees> the string with hyphens?
[18:25:24] <taplar> *in the console
[18:25:31] <freetlas> yes
[18:25:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/qncv3emj/3/
[18:26:48] <freetlas> I'm getting with hyphens in the second example. Why wasn't it working like that in the first example?
[18:26:54] <robertmaxrees> it is...
[18:26:58] <freetlas> Sorry for asking but I haven't understood yet
[18:27:00] <robertmaxrees> in your console.
[18:27:10] <robertmaxrees> dev tools
[18:27:15] <taplar> hit F12 to open your developer tools and go to the console tab
[18:27:33] <freetlas> Yeah, I'm seeing my console
[18:27:41] <freetlas> It aint show nothing
[18:27:45] <robertmaxrees> click on the LI.
[18:28:03] <taplar> have to go back to /1 though
[18:28:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:31:47] <freetlas> Oh, I see now. Sorry guys. Thanks!
[18:32:16] <robertmaxrees> all good :)
[18:32:51] <taplar> you should keep the console open usually when you are working on front end stuff.  It's an easy first detector if there is a syntax error or other error encountered.
[22:28:54] <destinydriven> I'm trying to get multiple column totals using datatables.  This same code would work fine for a single colum
[22:29:05] <destinydriven> column*
[22:29:55] <destinydriven> https://jsfiddle.net/eyLxsurp/.  But when I try to use each(). I get totals of 0 when there are actually non-zero values in my column
[23:06:33] <dodobrain> isnt $('#mydiv').remove('p')  correct?
[23:07:18] <dodobrain> it is not removing the child paragraphs! $('#mydiv p').remove()  works, so i dont see why the previous line wouldnt
[23:17:05] <pavonia> dodobrain: The former only removes elements that have ID "mydiv" and are p-elements, while the latter removes p-element inside of #mydiv
[23:17:41] <dodobrain> uh, thats a bit painful because i thought i could do some chaining
[23:17:48] <dodobrain> i want to hide #mydiv as well
[23:18:36] <dodobrain> so $('#mydiv').hide().removepchildren() cant be done in a single statement
[23:20:17] <pavonia> Try $('#mydiv').hide().find('p').remove()
[23:20:18] <shoky> dodobrain: $('#mydiv').hide().find('p').remove();  though that's a bit gross, imo
[23:20:50] <dodobrain> bah, i'll keep it as 2 statements
[23:20:55] <shoky> why would you want those 2 different operations on the same line/statement
[23:50:19] <destinydriven> Hey guys, I've been struggling with this problem. Grateful if someone can take a look and point out what I'm doing wrong.   https://pastebin.com/dA1Y72E0
[23:52:06] <destinydriven> I am using data tables and have a working version to get totals on 1 column - Attempt # 1.     So now I'm trying to do the same for multiple columns using each() and every() to loop through indices and basically do the same thing in my working example for 1 column
