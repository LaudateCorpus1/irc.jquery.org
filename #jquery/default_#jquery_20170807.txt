[03:59:48] <DreamStiffler> help
[04:00:32] <localh0st> DreamStiffler: you have error somewhere in the code, check the console....
[04:00:34] <localh0st> jquery-ui.js:15006 Uncaught TypeError: max.toFixed is not a function
[04:01:51] <DreamStiffler> localh0st: yea thats my issue
[04:02:06] <DreamStiffler> im backing up my script a little....without decimals now
[04:02:15] <DreamStiffler> but getting undefined for max
[04:02:24] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/19/
[04:03:13] <DreamStiffler> ok got it https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/20/ let me try more
[04:03:47] <jak2020> localh0st?
[04:05:22] <DreamStiffler> should i use change?
[04:17:50] <DreamStiffler> closest that im getting
[04:17:51] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/22/
[04:17:59] <DreamStiffler> problem is
[04:18:03] <DreamStiffler> after the button
[04:18:15] <DreamStiffler> the slider value no longer changes
[04:28:48] <jak2020> DreamStiffler: https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/28/
[04:30:10] <DreamStiffler> jak2020: sliding still doesnt work. i found something but then again, im still working on it
[04:30:28] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/29/
[04:30:57] <DreamStiffler> somehow the range doesnt kick in
[04:31:02] <DreamStiffler> max is still at 100
[04:33:10] <jak2020> done: https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/31/
[04:35:16] <jak2020> not?
[04:40:56] <DreamStiffler> hold on
[04:43:51] <DreamStiffler> jak2020: thank you for helping but not quite. im still fiddling. Let me try be clearer. Once i click the button, the slider is set to min 2 and max 7. Which we are almost there. I also want the two sliders be at the end of each sides. Meaning user can only slide between 2 and 7
[04:45:21] <DreamStiffler> this might be it
[04:45:22] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/32/
[04:45:32] <DreamStiffler> imma test it few times and get back to ya
[04:45:36] <DreamStiffler> thanks though
[04:45:43] <DreamStiffler> appreciate it much jak2020
[04:47:13] <DreamStiffler> havent used the variables yet
[04:47:27] <DreamStiffler> once that will need to try and use decimals
[04:47:32] <DreamStiffler> one step at a time
[04:49:21] <jak2020> define the button type
[06:01:14] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/d07o81d4/42/
[06:01:28] <DreamStiffler> okay
[06:01:32] <DreamStiffler> now thats 50% done
[06:19:22] <ThijsW> hello, Could somebody explain me something? I have to push a button that directs to a other document twice before it directs me to the page. on the first click it will refresh the page.
[06:20:03] <ThijsW> on my index I have to fill in a form, onclick the button will validate and redirect. But on the first click it checks validation and then it refreshed the page
[06:30:12] <GoSox> so in javascript, i'm using .change(); to change the value of some <select>'s. But the thing is, I have a .change() event set up to do something every time the select changes. My first action changes more than one select, which is causing the form to be "processed" multiple times.
[06:30:29] <GoSox> so i thought i could stick a .preventDefault() on all but the last call, but that doesn't seem to work
[06:30:53] <GoSox> waaaaaaait a minute, that's not what's actually happening :P nevermind
[06:32:40] <GoSox> ok problem solved, i was actively calling the change event twice, so now i just call it once :P
[06:49:57] <lemonsparrow> I want to fire a jquery event on second click..so not just on click.. how to achieve it ?
[07:02:37] <localh0st> lemonsparrow: you can store ifnromation of how many times the button was clicked, for example in this way: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/11381/
[07:06:07] <lemonsparrow> localh0st: thanks will check
[07:07:20] <lemonsparrow> localh0st: so in my case.. click inside a div twice and fire event.. if he clicks outside then reset.. the count
[07:26:28] <localh0st> lemonsparrow: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/11382/
[07:27:34] <lemonsparrow> localh0st: exctly what i was looking for.. thanks much :)
[07:41:37] <no_maam> Hi, I'm currently looking for some kind of image gallery. I have many many images on a server and I would like to have a gallery that allows me to scroll through them all. Every image has some kind of id and when the page is loaded, a few images should be loaded to the gallery. When the user has scrolled almost to the last image, ajax should be used to fetch more images from the server. Is there currently
[07:41:39] <no_maam> some kind of gallery that supports that? Almost all galleries I can find a build in a way that they are suiteable for a fixed number of images.
[07:49:35] <localh0st> no_maam: search for jquery lazy load gallery
[07:57:37] <IamTrying> <canvas> have a QR code captured as JPEG. How do i read the QR Code now?
[08:04:46] <moveax> hi there
[08:05:00] <moveax> i trigger an event per $('selector').trigger('change')
[08:05:11] <moveax> how to do things, after that event handler finished?
[08:05:30] <moveax> it will do an ajax request and i have to modify the element afterwards again
[08:05:33] <no_maam> localh0st: that's getting close to it, so I can lazy load those images, but I still need to specify how many images are there
[08:06:03] <MikeD_> the ajax request will have a callback ... or .then() you can use
[08:32:18] <localh0st> no_maam: such gallery is easy to be made manually IMO
[08:51:10] <no_maam> localh0st: ok, I will give it a try, maybe use a standard one as a template
[08:51:36] <localh0st> no_maam: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/11387/
[08:52:35] <localh0st> you just need to create backend function that will give you a list of images to load continously, you'll operate on those image's ids
[08:53:45] <localh0st> so at first on initialize, make an ajax call for last 50 images, it will respond with list of images and last id, in second load pass last id and backend should return you next 50 images starting with latest id
[08:55:50] <ksm101> Hey guys ! I'm having a problem with arrow functions not supported on ios9 (ipad mini, ...). I made a function with arrow function so that my context is being pass but I 'm not able to pass it using the ecma 5 way...
[08:56:35] <ksm101> It's basically : $(this._teamEl+' button.filter').on('click', (el) =>{
[08:56:35] <ksm101>           this.toggleButton(el.currentTarget);
[08:56:35] <ksm101> $(this._teamEl+' button.filter').on('click', (el) =>{ this.toggleButton(el.currentTarget); });
[08:56:46] <ksm101> oops, double post, sorry
[08:57:52] <ksm101> when replacing (el) => { this.xxx } with function(el){ this.xxx }, the second one is missing the context
[08:58:54] <ksm101> I know you can use the " var that = this; " trick, but I don't know how to pass the "that" variable to the jquery "on" function either, any help please ? thanks
[09:10:25] <ksm101> Nevermind, I was trying to pass the "that" variable as a parameter instead of just using "that" inside my function, it's working now, thanks anyways :)
[09:10:50] <AdamPDotty> so you probably want $(that._teamEl+' button.filter').on('click', el, function(){ that.toggleButton(this.currentTarget); });
[09:10:54] <AdamPDotty> fine fine
[09:11:19] <ksm101> Thanks AdamPDotty
[09:17:25] <moveax> thanks

[10:07:04] <`ULT> Hello, I have a problem with some Jquery code. I am using the plugin: Waypoints.
[10:07:33] <`ULT> In the code is a link <show more, press> with a click function. This is working correct. However: When scrolling to the bottom of the page, and scrolling back to the top of the page, this click function is not working anymore.
[10:07:47] <`ULT> You can checkt this on: https://jsfiddle.net/hkccvkms/
[10:08:30] <`ULT> Does someone know how I can fix this?
[10:13:05] <AdamPDotty> I believe you remove and reattach the element which causes it to lose the event handler.
[10:13:34] <AdamPDotty> You could attach the event handler to a container that remains.
[10:14:15] <`ULT> Oke Thank you. I was thinking someing like that also.
[10:14:42] <`ULT> I will try to get it working to attach it.
[10:15:54] <AdamPDotty> maybe like this: https://jsfiddle.net/hkccvkms/1/ :-)
[10:18:11] <`ULT> Thank you AdamPDotty, that is it exactely.
[10:18:29] <`ULT> Do you know where I can read about this problem so I can figur out why this is working and my solution not?
[10:18:36] <ksm101> hehe, too late :p https://jsfiddle.net/hkccvkms/2/
[10:21:07] <`ULT> is this called delegated events ?
[10:21:22] <AdamPDotty> yes
[10:21:38] <AdamPDotty> just always listen to Cork :-)
[10:22:26] <`ULT> Is this always better than just using the direct event?
[10:22:55] <`ULT> like $("a").on
[10:23:03] <ksm101> AdamPDotty's solution is better than mine as stated in jquery's "on" method : Avoid excessive use of document or document.body for delegated events on large documents.
[10:23:33] <taplar> delegate doesn't work for everything as well
[10:23:50] <taplar> for instance in the case of load events for images, they do not propagate up from the image
[10:24:03] <`ULT> I will check that. Thanks!
[10:52:23] <sine0> hey folks when you use jquery to get class name of id will it return all the class names in a string? will i have to scan that to match a certain class name im looking for
[10:59:07] <taplar> what do you mean?
[10:59:46] <taplar> console.log($('#blah').prop('class'))
[11:18:18] <sine0> its ok i have done it with if ( ... hasClass
[11:34:32] <Lost123> hi
[11:34:58] <Lost123> https://jsfiddle.net/Lsdbe8qc/ i want to send div_id as parameter along with callback, but cant. Please suggest
[11:36:14] <Lost123> this is updated https://jsfiddle.net/Lsdbe8qc/1/
[11:39:24] <taplar> what's the problem?
[11:40:11] <Lost123> taplar: i cannot send the parameter div_id to function   ajax_job_summary https://jsfiddle.net/Lsdbe8qc/1/
[11:40:20] <Lost123> taplar:  i have mentioned things in comments with code.
[11:41:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lsdbe8qc/2/  it's logging it for me
[11:43:32] <Lost123> taplar:  i also want the data that is returned by ajax call,
[11:43:50] <taplar> which is past the part that you said where the problem was
[11:43:57] <taplar> that fiddle shows it does indeed pass it in
[11:44:51] <Lost123> taplar:  what i need is  ajax_job_summary function takes in div_id as parameter and gives back the data from ajax call.
[11:45:04] <Lost123> sorry if i was not able to clarify my problem
[11:45:22] <taplar> so what part has the problem?
[11:45:25] <taplar> the ajax?
[11:46:17] <Lost123> no this part function ajax_job_summary(callback, div_id) { 	console.log(div_id);
[11:46:28] <taplar> that works in the fiddle
[11:46:33] <Lost123> inside the function when i checkc div_id its null
[11:46:45] <taplar> then your code on your site doesn't match that fiddle
[11:47:14] <Lost123> taplar:  it there a way my function function ajax_job_summary(callback, div_id) can return the data returned by ajax call?
[11:47:21] <taplar> no
[11:47:30] <taplar> ajax doesn't return results
[11:47:41] <taplar> you perform your logic inside that success method
[11:47:53] <taplar> it's not procedural
[11:48:26] <robertmaxrees> hence why a success method exists/it returns a promise
[11:48:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:48:48] <taplar> does your ajax request happen?  do you see it in your network console?
[11:49:30] <Lost123> robertmaxrees:  the elements do not exist when success is called, so i need the value and later on add it to html
[11:49:40] <robertmaxrees> where's the fiddle?
[11:49:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lsdbe8qc/2/
[11:49:48] <robertmaxrees> (sorry, was late to the party :) )
[11:50:15] <taplar> does your ajax request happen?  do you see it in your network console?
[11:50:16] <Lost123> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Lsdbe8qc/3/ if i do this i get the ajax reponse in  $('.jsum') elelment
[11:50:44] <Lost123> taplar:  yes it does
[11:50:50] <taplar> you're not passing it in dude
[11:50:59] <taplar> ln 28, you removed it as a parameter
[11:51:35] <Lost123> taplar:  was i passing it the right way?
[11:51:40] <taplar> not in /3
[11:51:44] <taplar> in /2 and i think /1 it was
[11:52:04] <taplar> yep
[11:52:07] <taplar> dunno why you remove it
[11:52:56] <taplar> and it's best to use console logs for debugging rather than alerts.  especially with ajax
[11:53:04] <taplar> alerts fk with the browser flow
[11:53:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:07:21] <codecutter> status = "[object Object]" (line 31), undefined (lines 42 -44)
[12:07:21] <codecutter> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined (line 34)
[12:07:22] <codecutter> https://pastebin.com/TT2Jqewr
[12:08:11] <taplar> pretty descriptive
[12:09:34] <taplar> is this what you were talking about the other day robertmaxrees of backbone?  the this.select() stuff?
[12:10:35] <codecutter> that comes from flight
[12:10:46] <codecutter> flight has its own selectors
[12:11:08] <taplar> ok, so two things.  1) the error is pretty descriptive telling you what is wrong and a starting place to debug
[12:11:14] <taplar> 2) this isn't jquery
[12:47:14] <ilhami> so if I want dual boot, can I easily do that from the Windows installation process? :)
[12:47:31] <taplar_lunch> with jquery, hell yeah
[12:47:37] <ilhami> oh wrong channel lol
[12:47:48] <ilhami> I thought I was in #ubuntu lmao
[12:49:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahaa
[12:55:16] <samsamek> are there any caveats to using $.element.val() rather than $(element).val()
[12:55:45] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:55:45] <taplar_lunch> is the first one even a thing?
[12:55:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:55:50] <robertmaxrees> not a thing.
[12:56:11] <robertmaxrees> unless somebody is storing specific elements on $, in which case kick them in the shins.
[12:56:13] <taplar_lunch> element.value or $(element).val()
[12:56:24] <taplar_lunch> lol
[12:56:28] <samsamek> lolol
[12:56:38] <samsamek> its not a jquery element yet so .val() doesnt work straight away
[12:56:46] <taplar_lunch> then just do value
[12:56:54] <samsamek> and $.element.val() works.. performance wise its not good?
[12:56:56] <taplar_lunch> unless you need the jQuery object version for other things
[12:57:05] <samsamek> taplar_lunch: like $.each()
[12:57:10] <samsamek> I understand
[12:57:13] <samsamek> not for DOM
[12:57:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:57:21] <taplar_lunch> i'm lost
[12:57:25] <robertmaxrees> so what is $.element supposed to be??
[12:57:30] <robertmaxrees> can you share some code?
[12:57:36] <samsamek> sure but let me explain first
[12:57:48] * taplar_lunch anticipates a code smell due to ^
[12:58:00] <robertmaxrees> erm... okay heh
[12:58:17] <samsamek> ill just share the code
[12:58:23] <robertmaxrees> awesome. thanks.
[13:00:40] <samsamek> https://kopy.io/KA7oZ
[13:00:54] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:01:08] <samsamek> speak, dont be shy
[13:01:11] <samsamek> :p
[13:01:46] <taplar_lunch> where's the $.element.val() thing?
[13:01:49] <robertmaxrees> so first off,. why are you selecting with data attributes?
[13:01:55] <robertmaxrees> taplar_lunch it's in the comments in that each
[13:02:01] <samsamek> well its actually attr(), im used val() as an example
[13:02:18] <samsamek> I used*
[13:02:25] <samsamek> the point is that its a jquery function
[13:02:25] <robertmaxrees> samsamek so first off, element.attr() doesn't work in that each because it's a raw dom element.
[13:02:31] <robertmaxrees> also: you want $().each here.
[13:02:33] <samsamek> yes, im aware
[13:02:47] <samsamek> robertmaxrees: okay, elaborate the parenthesis
[13:02:54] <taplar_lunch> calendars.each(...)
[13:02:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:02:58] <samsamek> oh that works?
[13:03:01] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:03:02] <taplar_lunch> y not?
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> it won't fix your issue.
[13:03:09] <robertmaxrees> but that's the one you want.
[13:03:32] <robertmaxrees> otherwiuse you might end up crawling through parts of the object you don't expect to.
[13:03:44] <samsamek> well I dont really have an issue, my question is since both methods works ($.el.val()   AND  $(el).val()   ) im just trying to understand the fundemental difference
[13:03:57] <taplar_lunch> $.el.val() you aren't doing this
[13:04:01] <taplar_lunch> why do you keep saying that
[13:04:04] <robertmaxrees> taplar_lunch // console.log($.element.attr('data-calendar-id')); works too
[13:04:15] <taplar_lunch> huh?
[13:04:22] <robertmaxrees> that's in his code.
[13:04:28] <taplar_lunch> ah, wait, what?
[13:04:52] <samsamek> I commented everything out, its not important what im using or not.. Im just saying both methods work fine, so Im just left questioning which one to use in the future
[13:04:52] <robertmaxrees> it's in there (shrug)
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> samsamek it doesn't work here.
[13:05:10] <samsamek> $.el.val()  or $(el).val()
[13:05:14] <robertmaxrees> samsamek https://jsfiddle.net/phces3vy/2/
[13:05:15] <samsamek> it works just fine here mate :p
[13:05:22] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle then.
[13:05:24] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[13:05:30] <robertmaxrees> ';cause i've never heard of that working before heh.
[13:05:53] <samsamek> robertmaxrees: check val calendars, its looking for <table> elements, you put a <span> in the body though
[13:06:07] <robertmaxrees> woops - https://jsfiddle.net/phces3vy/3/
[13:06:09] <robertmaxrees> there.
[13:06:11] <robertmaxrees> that errors.
[13:06:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/phces3vy/4/ as does this.
[13:07:20] <samsamek> hmm okay hold on.. I really think mine works, testing again
[13:07:22] <robertmaxrees> to directly answer your question, you want $(element).val() or element.value
[13:08:39] <samsamek> Youre right! it doesnt work
[13:08:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:08:50] <samsamek> So why does $.each work though? :p
[13:09:01] <robertmaxrees> because that's a generic enumerator
[13:09:01] <samsamek> $.each(calendars, function(){ .. });
[13:09:06] <robertmaxrees> it's meant for objects/arrays.
[13:09:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a utility method.
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> when working with jquery objects though, favor the one I showed you.
[13:10:26] <samsamek> I will!
[13:11:06] <samsamek> Here’s another thing that has been bothering me..
[13:12:05] <taplar> war
[13:12:10] <taplar> what's it good for?
[13:12:17] <robertmaxrees> absolutely NOTHING
[13:12:19] <taplar> yeah
[13:14:04] <samsamek> :’)
[13:14:06] <samsamek> https://kopy.io/zioD1
[13:14:18] <samsamek> the attribute variable is set within that function
[13:14:31] <robertmaxrees> okay back up
[13:14:37] <samsamek> ..
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> $.each(calendars, function(index, element) { just said to not do this :D
[13:14:49] <samsamek> yes im using $.each ill fix that later :p
[13:15:03] <robertmaxrees> also: why is everything being declared as a global?
[13:15:18] <samsamek> okay lets get back on that, first let me ask this
[13:15:21] <robertmaxrees> also also: why are you still selecting on a data attribute?
[13:15:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:15:28] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:15:30] <taplar> and data() is nifty
[13:15:42] <samsamek> var attribute is set inside that function, but the scope reaches further than that
[13:15:48] <taplar> lol
[13:15:56] <robertmaxrees> why do you want that to be global in the first place?
[13:15:57] <samsamek> I can call console.log(attribute) outside that function
[13:15:58] <taplar> robertmaxrees
[13:15:59] <taplar> also: why is everything being declared as a global?
[13:16:03] <taplar> ^ robert quote
[13:16:11] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:16:12] <samsamek> what is a global? is my attribute function a global?
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> *attribute variable
[13:16:24] <samsamek> is that why its available everywhere inside the jquery encapsulation?
[13:16:34] <robertmaxrees> iut's everywhere on the page period.
[13:16:34] <samsamek> i mean attribute variable lol
[13:16:36] <robertmaxrees> you left off var
[13:16:40] <samsamek> oh goodness
[13:16:53] <samsamek> there is a way to keep that attribute ‘existence’ inside that function?
[13:16:57] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/500431/what-is-the-scope-of-variables-in-javascript
[13:17:00] <samsamek> if so, enlighten me
[13:17:04] <robertmaxrees> prepend it with var >.>
[13:17:06] <robertmaxrees> var attribute
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> done
[13:17:38] <samsamek> excellent resource taplar
[13:17:52] <samsamek> if I knew this before
[13:17:56] <taplar> i'd rather link it that type it out, :)
[13:17:57] <samsamek> i wouldnt have to use silly variable names
[13:18:14] <samsamek> link and type out? whut
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> type out the explanation of how scope works in JS.
[13:19:08] <robertmaxrees> btw https://jsfiddle.net/00195sax/
[13:19:23] <robertmaxrees> selecting on data attributes is funky business.
[13:19:46] <MikeD_> why funky business?
[13:19:51] <samsamek> robertmaxrees: interesting, I’m looking for best practices always
[13:20:03] <samsamek> explain
[13:20:03] <taplar> not all data attributes are in the dom
[13:20:07] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:20:11] <samsamek> which ones are left out?
[13:20:17] <robertmaxrees> those set via .data()
[13:20:22] <taplar> if you set a data() attribute logically, it's in the jquery cache
[13:20:24] <samsamek> what does data() do
[13:20:24] <robertmaxrees> also: selecting via attributes is inefficient.
[13:20:42] <robertmaxrees> really, you wanna give those tables a class.
[13:20:45] <robertmaxrees> and select on that.
[13:20:52] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:21:09] <taplar> you're asking things that a quick api or google search can tell you
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:21:28] <samsamek> yes that last question was unnecessary
[13:22:00] <samsamek> but then again, classes are meant for css
[13:22:05] <taplar> nope
[13:22:15] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:22:18] <taplar> css uses classes, but they are not reliant on them
[13:22:20] <samsamek> oh rly
[13:22:27] <taplar> it's not like a class without a css rule is invalid markup
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> they're great for readability, too.
[13:23:02] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason selecting via class just takes doing .someClassName
[13:23:42] <robertmaxrees> whereas attribute selectors are a little funkier.
[13:23:43] <samsamek> Well I think I’m convinced to use classes for selecting
[13:24:11] <robertmaxrees> IDs are also good, but since you can only have one on a page should only be used for things that are guaranteed to be unique.
[13:24:22] <samsamek> yup, agreed
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> rather *use a particular class once per page
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> either way, classes are solid.
[13:24:58] <taplar> #someId { color: red; }
[13:24:59] <samsamek> makes sense
[13:25:03] <taplar> we don't call them css ids
[13:25:04] <taplar> :P
[13:25:10] <samsamek> :’D
[13:25:27] <taplar> p { background-color: gray; }
[13:25:29] <taplar> css tag?
[13:25:33] <samsamek> I need to learn ReactJS soon, the learning curve is steeper than jquery not?
[13:25:46] <robertmaxrees> *react
[13:25:49] <robertmaxrees> not ReactJS :)
[13:25:54] <samsamek> really?
[13:25:57] <samsamek> I thought..
[13:26:01] <robertmaxrees> https://facebook.github.io/react/
[13:26:12] <samsamek> huh sinds when did that change
[13:26:20] <robertmaxrees> it's always been react >.>
[13:26:36] <taplar> reactjs may just make google search find it easier
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> ^ some people refer to it as reactjs or react.js, but the project is just React
[13:27:15] <robertmaxrees> also: comparing React and jQuery is a bit of a stretch.
[13:29:34] <samsamek> Yeh its not the same thing
[13:30:04] <robertmaxrees> i know plenty of people that have picked up react fairly quickly.  all depends on your familarity with JS./
[13:30:35] <samsamek> I’m looking forward to the adventure
[13:30:49] <samsamek> and the headaches
[13:31:15] <robertmaxrees> haha.  i'd brush up on your JS basics before you dive in tbh.
[13:40:35] <samsamek> why dis no work: https://jsfiddle.net/xqnhd9og/
[13:40:56] <robertmaxrees> because that'
[13:40:59] <samsamek> JSON.parse is not converting my perfectly fine object string to a JSON object
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> *that's already an object.
[13:41:06] <taplar> -_-
[13:41:08] <robertmaxrees> you want JSON.stringify
[13:41:11] <samsamek> :’)
[13:41:17] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
[13:41:21] <samsamek> actually
[13:41:27] <samsamek> Let me edit the code
[13:41:28] <robertmaxrees> "The JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string [...]"
[13:41:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xqnhd9og/1/ is what it's for.
[13:44:28] <samsamek> https://jsfiddle.net/y80bycd8/
[13:44:49] <robertmaxrees> because that's not valid JSON
[13:45:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y80bycd8/1/
[13:45:13] <robertmaxrees> json must use double quotes around property names and strings.
[13:45:24] <samsamek> Aha!
[13:45:55] <taplar> script#data -> #data
[13:46:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:46:11] <robertmaxrees> don't prepend classes and IDs with the tagname
[14:57:59] <kegster> if i use .prop('selected',true) on an <option> -- does that prevent the user from changing it?
[14:58:07] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:58:15] <robertmaxrees> that just sets that option to selected.
[14:58:23] <robertmaxrees> user can still change it at any time.
[15:03:30] <sine0> should i load my jquery script at the bottom of the page ?
[15:03:47] <taplar> if possible
[15:04:01] <taplar> though there is that async tag on script now apparently
[15:04:10] <taplar> but it'd let you avoid doc ready
[15:05:47] <sine0> taplar: i have nothing in my docready script apart from this : $('#frame_steel img').addClass('iamselected');
[15:05:55] <sine0> but its not affecting the page when i load it up.
[15:05:59] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[15:06:05] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that via JS?
[15:06:27] <sine0> robertmaxrees: are you talking to me
[15:06:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:06:44] <sine0> why not
[15:07:05] <taplar> you are always performing that action, not conditionally
[15:07:12] <robertmaxrees> why not just pop that into the markup by default?
[15:07:15] <taplar> so why not make your page start in it's pristine state?
[15:07:42] <sine0> taplar: but its still not having an affect.
[15:07:47] <robertmaxrees> alterantively, why not usre have your css target #frame_steel img and add whatever CSS you need.
[15:07:52] <sine0> robertmaxrees: i had an issue and i was trying to strip it back
[15:08:09] <robertmaxrees> sine0 awfully strange to add a default class like that via JS.
[15:08:34] <sine0> yea im just testing
[15:08:40] <sine0> my concern is why its not working
[15:08:55] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically adding those images?
[15:09:05] <robertmaxrees> via js or something.  maybe as the result of an ajax call?
[15:09:20] <sine0> pphhhhhhhh
[15:09:37] <sine0> I have 3 images that i want to click on and have the border show up to show that its been selected
[15:09:54] <sine0> that class has a pink border etc
[15:09:54] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[15:10:20] <robertmaxrees> so are you adding them via ajax or something?  I don't have your code in front of me so there's no way I can know.
[15:10:43] <robertmaxrees> if not, then you either need a document ready or for your code to come after the related markup.
[15:10:47] <sine0> no just jquery script
[15:11:16] <sine0> $(document).ready(function() { $('#frame_steel img').addClass('iamselected'); });
[15:11:25] <sine0> it was working inside a on click
[15:11:34] <robertmaxrees> is your markup valid?
[15:11:48] <sine0> what does that even mean
[15:12:03] <robertmaxrees> is... your html valid?
[15:12:06] <robertmaxrees> per the standards?
[15:12:18] <robertmaxrees> https://validator.w3.org/
[15:12:23] <robertmaxrees> does it pass this
[15:12:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:16:19] <gambl0re> hello?
[15:16:40] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:17:11] <gambl0re> hi robert
[15:17:14] <gambl0re> hows going?
[15:17:18] <robertmaxrees> meh.
[15:17:20] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[15:17:38] <gambl0re> im good. thanks
[15:17:43] <gambl0re> i have a question for you
[15:17:47] <robertmaxrees> for me?
[15:17:57] <robertmaxrees> why not for the channel?
[15:17:58] <gambl0re> im going to pm you
[15:18:00] <gambl0re> one sec
[15:18:07] <taplar> start of every romcom
[15:18:20] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:18:21] <robertmaxrees> please don't.,
[15:18:26] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel, yo :)
[15:20:17] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re duder, keep it in the channel :)
[15:20:56] <gambl0re> if you check the console, why is the currentQuestion not incrementing by one?
[15:21:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:21:10] <gambl0re> it's doubling every time
[15:21:11] <robertmaxrees> what console?
[15:21:19] <gambl0re> in the codepen
[15:21:26] <robertmaxrees> ? i didn't even read what you sent.
[15:21:34] <robertmaxrees> pop it into the channel :)
[15:21:36] <gambl0re> in your pm
[15:21:49] <robertmaxrees> oh.  yeah, just send it to the channel.
[15:22:00] <gambl0re> ok...did you take a look?
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:22:07] <robertmaxrees> i can if you send it to the channel.
[15:23:02] <robertmaxrees> >.> #welp
[15:24:12] <robertmaxrees> lol and he's gone to ##javascript.  weird.
[15:24:23] <taplar> *shrug*
[15:57:02] <Flerex> Is there any way to make function f(a = '',b) { return b * 3; } return 6 with f(2) ?
[15:57:20] <Flerex> whoops wrong channel
[15:57:55] <taplar> should that be a = 0?
[15:58:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:58:10] <taplar> '' * 3 == weird
[15:58:24] <taplar> and i thought that was just for function parameters
[16:01:10] <taplar> oh it is a function, lol
[16:01:17] <taplar> i imagined it started with 'if'
[16:01:50] <taplar> how would that even work though?
[16:02:12] <taplar> f(null, 2)
[16:02:15] <taplar> ?
[16:04:39] <Flerex> I was asking for a way to have optional parameters and identify which one is actually set
[16:04:55] <taplar> optional parameters typically have to be at the end
[16:04:56] <Flerex> apparently it hast to be done either with the arguments var or with rest parameters
[16:05:13] <Flerex> yeah, it's just that i liked the order
[16:05:17] <Flerex> it was a stupid question, honestly haha
[16:08:36] <taplar> 'rest parameters' ?
[16:09:11] <Flerex> function(...args) this
[16:09:24] <Flerex> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters
[16:09:50] <taplar> weird, I was thinking you were saying REST
[16:10:02] <Flerex> oh, no haha
[16:11:15] <taplar> i'm not awesome with ES6 yet
[16:12:45] <Flerex> Me neither, I'm just learning about it
[16:12:48] <taplar> i'd kinda be tempted to just do like f(input) { return ( input.a || 1 * input.b || 1); }
[16:12:49] <Flerex> It's kinda awesome tbh
[16:13:58] <taplar> eh, maybe not
[16:19:47] <Flerex> why not?
[16:20:53] <taplar> Well your example is just doing multiplication.  So you could just default the second argument and call it a day.  Order doesn't matter with multiplicaiton
[16:21:27] <Flerex> Oh it was just a dummy example. The actual question was what I said before about identifying optional parameters
[16:21:41] <taplar> I know, but that was my reason, :)
[16:39:18] <sine0> 0
[16:40:16] <sine0> if I want to affect the class of a div on the entire page I can access it by jQuery('#div-id').removeClass('abc');
[16:40:18] <sine0> right ?
[16:40:36] <taplar> to remove the class from that element, yes
[16:41:08] <taplar> not sure what you mean by 'on the entire page'
[16:48:52] <sine0> ok i see the problem. in wordpress you can assign id to the wrapper, however what you want to affect is the div immediatly inside of it
[16:49:13] <sine0> $('parent-div-id .class-of-child/')
[16:49:17] <sine0> can i do something like that
[16:49:22] <sine0> $('parent-div-id div')
[16:49:59] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:50:03] <robertmaxrees> just like in CSS.
[16:50:12] <robertmaxrees> though that second one will hit every div that's a descended of that ID.
[16:50:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd target a class if possible.
[16:51:20] <taplar> or $(parent-div-id).children(class)
[16:58:27] <neo_> hi guys !
[16:59:50] <taplar> hola
[17:09:11] <skypce> how can i print a piece of html with css styles applied? i was tried with printThis but do not function ok
[17:09:38] <taplar> print where?
[17:09:55] <skypce> print to pdf
[17:09:57] <skypce> or printer
[17:11:05] <robertmaxrees> css should apply just fine.
[17:11:16] <robertmaxrees> unless your print styles are wonk
[17:13:26] <skypce> i have @media print{}
[17:13:31] <skypce> and global styles
[17:13:39] <skypce> both not work
[17:14:10] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/28596805/923919
[17:15:58] <skypce> robertmaxrees, i need print a piece of content throught a click event
[17:16:03] <skypce> i have this code
[17:16:12] <skypce> $('#print_result').on('click', function() {
[17:16:18] <skypce> i need the print function only
[17:17:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:17:18] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[17:18:21] <skypce> $(".print").print();
[17:19:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[17:22:13] <skypce> i need remove all other markup
[17:22:21] <skypce> for print some region of page
[17:22:22] <skypce> mmm
[17:26:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah, gotta rethink that.
[17:31:34] <robertmaxrees> skypce https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ogrqvr0t/
[17:32:14] <robertmaxrees> except that print class would just be a @media print css dealio
[17:35:24] <skypce> ok thank you robertmaxrees
