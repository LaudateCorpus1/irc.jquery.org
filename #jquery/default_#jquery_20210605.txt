[05:34:38] <braindead_> hey all. i want to add a second if statement to this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/PFnvc45w9c/
[05:35:12] <braindead_> so if url contains "events" and ($(window).width() < 768) then hide the class
[05:35:27] <robertmaxrees> you basically just wrote it...
[05:35:50] <braindead_> yes but how do I add the second condition?
[05:36:24] <robertmaxrees> no offense intended, but do you know basic javascipt?
[05:36:34] <braindead_> you probably can tell already
[05:36:41] <robertmaxrees> ??
[05:37:30] <braindead_> if(and()), <- i saw this but i am still not quite sure
[05:38:01] <robertmaxrees> wat... try adding the code and show us what you come up with.
[05:38:09] <braindead_> ok, give me a sec
[05:40:16] <braindead_> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/kWH8qz6r3K/
[05:41:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[05:41:34] <braindead_> yes i know :) its not working and i guess its no surpise to you
[05:41:54] <robertmaxrees> it's not?  do you not know javascript?
[05:42:05] <braindead_> you really want to hear it dont you :)
[05:42:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[05:42:18] <braindead_> no, i obviously dont know it
[05:42:22] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[05:42:43] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?  you want to add the window width as another condition?
[05:43:08] <braindead_> yes, i want to hide the class if both statements are true
[05:43:39] <robertmaxrees> just need to shuffle your parens.
[05:43:47] <braindead_> if url contains "events" and the window width is smaller 768 hide ".newsletter-btn"
[05:44:28] <robertmaxrees> here's your freebie
[05:44:30] <robertmaxrees> https://bpa.st/OTMA
[05:45:11] <braindead_> i was suuuuper close
[05:45:25] <braindead_> one pair of brackets
[05:45:32] <robertmaxrees> *parens
[05:45:37] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[05:45:59] <braindead_> thank you robertmaxrees
[05:47:15] <braindead_> and its working like a charm too (surprise :)
[05:47:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
