[00:02:12] <thomedy> thats much better its hard to work with a 7month old snorring in your arms
[00:03:32] <thomedy> nope cleared my cache still not there it happens if you click on one image do some scrolling and then click on another image
[00:03:37] <thomedy> but ill knock it out
[00:03:42] <thomedy> im going to try to make it window.
[00:04:54] <wodemaye_> how do you parse a json object?
[00:05:35] <Eviltwin> JSON.parse?
[00:05:38] <Eviltwin> $.parseJSON>
[00:05:39] <Eviltwin> ?
[00:05:58] <radiantstatic> I'm currently using this - http://pastebin.com/T94vgqHU - to change my input fields when the radio buttons are clicked, but how can i have them check whether a radio is selected immediately on load and not just on click??
[00:12:58] <radiantstatic> Anyone?
[00:12:58] <wodemaye_> { could it be said that ajax is a misnomer now that we use json instead of xml?
[00:13:06] <wodemaye_> shouldn't it be called ajaj?
[00:15:09] <coldhead> thomedy: i am pretty sure it's a logic problem more than a scope problem
[00:15:20] <coldhead> wodemaye_: hell yes
[00:15:53] <wodemaye_> coldhead, does js have heredocs?
[00:16:01] <coldhead> no
[00:16:05] <coldhead> its the worst thing ever
[00:16:13] <coldhead> you have to use something like coffeescript
[00:16:24] <coldhead> its coming to some future javascript, supposedly
[00:16:35] <coldhead> but who is gonna wait 20 years
[00:16:38] <thomedy> i fixed it
[00:16:42] <thomedy> i think
[00:16:46] <coldhead> wodemaye_: this is another reason why you want to use templates
[00:17:06] <coldhead> brb paperwork >_>
[00:17:33] <thomedy> thats it now to lock down security and tighten efficiency

[00:26:07] <Dr-Bombay> sorry, i can't make it go
[00:27:32] <wodemaye_> Dr-Bombay, it's not *that* much..
[00:37:06] <StevenCodes> Dr-Bombay,  Holy shit that dude is on something lol
[00:37:23] <wodemaye_> StevenCodes, who, me?
[00:37:42] <StevenCodes> wodemaye_,  Yeah thats alot of regex bro
[00:37:44] <LukeNukem> sup StevenCodes
[00:38:13] <StevenCodes> LukeNukem,  nm chillin working on some jquery snippets
[00:38:16] <StevenCodes> yourself ?
[00:38:29] <LukeNukem> fucked up my linux install br
[00:38:31] <LukeNukem> bro
[00:38:33] <wodemaye_> oh c'mon, more than half of it is 2 strings.
[00:38:41] <wodemaye_> you don't look at those parts, just scroll past them immediately.
[00:38:50] <wodemaye_> LukeNukem, we're in the same boat.
[00:39:09] <wodemaye_> StevenCodes, that's regex from the jquery validation plugin.
[00:39:13] <LukeNukem> wodemaye_, i changed ownership of /etc/ to 1000  0_0
[00:39:16] <wodemaye_> it doesn't need debugged.
[00:39:23] <wodemaye_> oh god.
[00:39:32] <LukeNukem> v_v
[00:39:38] <wodemaye_> i tried running sudo killall killall once from vt1
[00:40:18] <wodemaye_> LukeNukem, you mind having a look at  my code real quick? don't worry about the first two huge lines.  except maybe the json.
[00:40:28] <wodemaye_> its not as daunting as it looks, i swear.
[00:40:39] <LukeNukem> no problem, link me
[00:42:47] <LukeNukem> link me quick bro, i got like 6 minutes before i reboot and do a clean install
[00:43:11] <coldhead> which distro LukeNukem ?
[00:43:13] <radiantstatic> Any reason why the last box, with activation radio button "off" isn't fading on load? - http://jsfiddle.net/C9wqa/
[00:43:19] <LukeNukem> ubuntu coldhead
[00:43:34] <coldhead> 12.04?
[00:43:40] <LukeNukem> 11.10
[00:43:50] <coldhead> why would you mess with the permisssions of etc on ubuntu >: |
[00:44:02] <LukeNukem> i was stoopid :<
[00:44:04] <coldhead> i pity the fool
[00:44:10] <coldhead> well good luck

[00:44:23] <LukeNukem> cant even friggin boot the damn cd
[00:44:25] <wodemaye_> LukeNukem, there ya go.
[00:44:37] <wodemaye_> LukeNukem, DONT FUCKING USE UBUNTU.  TRUST ME>
[00:44:42] <wodemaye_> it is SO unstable.
[00:44:49] <coldhead> wodemaye_: do you have a debugger?
[00:44:50] <wodemaye_> go debian or arch or something, anything else.
[00:44:54] <Eviltwin> I'm up 96 days on Ubuntu
[00:44:56] <wodemaye_> coldhead, what's that?
[00:45:00] <wodemaye_> Eviltwin, which release?
[00:45:03] <coldhead> which browser are you using?
[00:45:17] <Eviltwin> 11.10 Desktop
[00:45:29] <coldhead> wodemaye_: i have been using 10.04 almost daily since it came out and i've had about 5 stability issues in total
[00:45:42] <coldhead> its been very excellent, really
[00:45:46] <LukeNukem> dat a lot of regex bro
[00:45:48] <wodemaye_> coldhead, i'm talking about the lastest one.
[00:45:58] <LukeNukem> coldhead, 10.04 is LTS isn't it?
[00:46:03] <coldhead> it is, LukeNukem
[00:46:04] <wodemaye_> LukeNukem, yeah, but ignore it. its verbatim lifted from jquery validation plugin.
[00:46:07] <coldhead> that's why i was using it
[00:46:15] <wodemaye_> LukeNukem, i believe so.
[00:46:18] <coldhead> everything feels a little bit retro
[00:46:21] <coldhead> but it works
[00:46:41] <wodemaye_> but that doesn't mean shit.  look at hardy lts when they decided to put in pulse in that retarded botched way.
[00:46:48] <LukeNukem> coldhead, X.04 is LTS coldhead ?
[00:46:50] <coldhead> wodemaye_: if you open firebug console in firefox or web inspector console in chrome you will see the error
[00:46:54] <wodemaye_> LukeNukem, seriously, i'll cut out the regex line if you want.
[00:46:58] <LukeNukem> wodemaye_, what do i need to check?
[00:47:04] <coldhead> LukeNukem: i think every 2 years, so 10.04 and 12.04
[00:47:12] <wodemaye_> coldhead, no its 18months.
[00:47:20] <wodemaye_> coldhead, even if i run it in jsfiddle?
[00:47:30] <LukeNukem> bbl
[00:47:31] <coldhead> especially if you run it on jsfiddle
[00:47:35] <coldhead> that's where i see it
[00:48:44] <coldhead> learn to use your debugger, wodemaye_ , it will save you hours

[02:51:34] <bee> Hello all
[03:25:02] <cortexman> soooo annoying... looking for something to set attribute values: http://api.jquery.com/category/attributes/
[03:25:20] <cortexman> turns out there is nothing on this page that indicates attr had been overloaded to also set them. asklfjal;kfjsadflkj
[03:25:41] <raj> if a user is using IE (any version), I would like to return true, but it seems $.browser is deprecated?
[03:27:35] <raj> also, why does Chrome show up as Safari???
[03:28:27] <cortexman> because they both use WebKit?
[03:35:25] <Dr-Bombay> raj: looks like you don't have any option right now except to use browser and be careful when upgrading jquery
[03:37:00] <beancurd> you could technically do some funky roundabout thing with <!--[if !IE]>-->
[03:37:02] <beancurd> ?
[03:37:08] <ravenzz> you can play with navigator.userAgent or use jQuery.support to check for unsupported properties by ie
[03:38:33] <Dr-Bombay> yeah but .browser already does whatever tricks would have to be done directly to determine the browser version
[03:39:03] <raj> why are they getting rid of it?
[03:39:09] <raj> it's such a useful thing
[03:40:02] <Dr-Bombay> raj: it's an attractive nuisance. People use it to check for browser features
[03:40:19] <raj> what's a better way to check for features?
[03:40:48] <Dr-Bombay> the documentation for .browser explains that
[03:42:28] <mannio> guys, can you help ? For last 3 days it's doing my heading, I can't figure out what's wrong. Here is code: http://pastebin.com/8uZGYSHw Why I cannot clearInterval from another function ?!
[03:43:04] <Dr-Bombay> raj: in 1996 when everyone was designing pages especially for Mozilla, there were web sites that would serve an "enhanced" version to Mozilla and a crappy version to other browsers...
[03:43:32] <Dr-Bombay> even though IE implemented Mozilla's extensions, it wouldn't get the right version of the page unless it pretended to be Mozilla
[03:43:35] <Dr-Bombay> which it did
[03:43:48] <raj> interesting
[03:43:49] <Dr-Bombay> the jquery team doesn't want that kind of thing to happen again
[03:44:38] <raj> well, basically, IE doesn't support multiple file upload in a single request, so I need to check to make sure my code divies up the uploads for IE
[03:47:18] <mannio> guys, why it is impossible to clearInterval from another function ?
[03:47:47] <Woet> ?demo @ mannio
[03:47:48] <bot-t> mannio, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:48:06] <mannio> ok, just a min.
[03:49:39] <Dr-Bombay> raj: you could just divide up the uploads regardless. IE can send several requests on one connection.
[03:50:51] <Woet> mannio: btw, I just noticed your paste - the variable timername isn't global
[03:51:11] <Woet> mannio: put "var timerName = null;" outside the functions
[03:51:19] <Woet> mannio: then it'll work.
[03:53:13] <Axcy> A general question - Would is be possible to have the user click a link in the upper left part of the page, which makes a div appear on the right side, and focuses on this newly appeared div? - It's mostly the last part about focusing I'm wondering about if it's possible
[03:57:18] <raj> Dr-Bombay, I know, but my code's gonna be so messy, I so didn't want to
[03:57:29] <raj> serverside
[03:58:56] <Dr-Bombay> if you plan to divide the uploads in IE, then the server has to be ready for multiple uploads anyway
[03:59:10] <Dr-Bombay> for separate uploads I mean
[04:00:10] <raj> right, but the uploads are attached to a node
[04:00:44] <raj> so if the requests are consecutive, I'll have to requery the db for the node and then add another file to it
[04:01:22] <raj> my other option was to only allow a single file to be uploaded for IE
[04:11:23] <wodemaye_> how long are jsfiddles kept?
[04:12:28] <dr0id> lifetime
[04:12:44] <Dr-Bombay> until they are not
[04:13:02] <dr0id> let them know when you die, so that they can delete and save some space.
[04:14:02] <wodemaye_> dr0id, seriously? they never expire? that's awesome.
[04:14:07] <wodemaye_> do you have a citation?
[05:20:04] <deiu> Hello!
[05:21:48] <deiu> What's the best way to add text to an element on the fly? Let's say I have <time></time> and I want to do something like <time><script> $(this).text('The time is..blah');</script></time>
[05:22:03] <deiu> If I use $(this) it doesn't work.
[05:22:52] <ThiefMaster> iiif you really need to do this you'll have to use document.write()
[05:23:01] <ThiefMaster> better give the element an id and access it through this id
[05:23:19] <ThiefMaster> <time id="now"></time><script>$('#now').text(...);</script>
[05:23:32] <deiu> I see, thanks!
[05:24:19] <deiu> The thing is, I'm trying to output text from a function there, but I can't do it directly for some reason.
[05:25:07] <deiu> I want to do something like: <time><script>myfunction();</script></time>
[05:25:45] <deiu> actually, I'm trying to use moment.js
[05:25:47] <RandalSchwartz> what is a <time> element?
[05:25:57] <RandalSchwartz> I don't recall that in HTML5
[05:26:05] <RandalSchwartz> I might be misremembering
[05:26:06] <deiu> it can be a <div>
[05:26:17] <deiu> it doesn't matter :)
[05:26:19] <RandalSchwartz> <div class="time"> sure
[05:26:29] <RandalSchwartz> but try to stick with elements that actually work. :)
[05:26:48] <deiu> even if I replace time with div, it still won't work
[05:27:15] <deiu> it doesn't display the function output, nor an error for that matter
[05:28:04] <RandalSchwartz> sure.  <script> doesn't have any idea of "output"
[05:28:08] <RandalSchwartz> do what ThiefMaster said
[05:28:40] <RandalSchwartz> <div id="time"></div><script>$('#time').text(yourfunc())</script>
[05:28:51] <RandalSchwartz> but I'd suggest putting that in a docready func
[05:29:07] <RandalSchwartz> $(function() { ... });
[05:29:17] <RandalSchwartz> then it won't fire until the dom is ready for it
[05:29:33] <RandalSchwartz> some browsers don't like scripts firing too soon.. :)
[05:30:26] * RandalSchwartz waits for deiu to catch up
[05:30:28] <deiu> Thanks, I'll look into it. :)
[05:33:53] <deiu> it's a bit silly that I can't output the function directly, without passing through jQuery
[05:34:24] <RandalSchwartz> no it's not
[05:34:34] <deiu> No wait..I get it now.
[05:34:38] <RandalSchwartz> if it did that, you'd have to also have a way to suppress it.
[05:34:49] <deiu> Forgot js is client side :)
[05:35:00] <RandalSchwartz> otherwise you'd end up with all these "0" for each script. :)
[05:35:13] <deiu> yeah
[05:35:28] <RandalSchwartz> and script should generally be put in .js files for caching anyway
[05:35:34] <RandalSchwartz> putting it inline defeats that
[05:35:55] <RandalSchwartz> also .js-in-html can be problematic for text editors and some HTML parsers.
[05:36:28] <deiu> Yeah, but I'm creating those divs dynamically
[05:36:42] <RandalSchwartz> well - then communicate that by class
[05:36:50] <RandalSchwartz> $('.class'). do something
[05:36:57] <RandalSchwartz> so the .js can always remain the same
[05:37:14] <RandalSchwartz> if nothing of that .class exists, then no harm

With the input one it works great. The select one i got no acces. Its undefined. alert($(element).children(":first-child").val());
[06:20:56] <Scretchy> element is the td...
[06:21:10] <xec> maybe the input isn't the first child?
[06:21:36] <Scretchy> must be. i write in the line before the select into the td
[06:21:44] <beancurd> Scretchy: use .html(), not val.
[06:21:46] <beancurd> val()
[06:21:54] <xec> Scretchy: can you pastebin the html?

[06:22:31] <beancurd> that's intense.
[06:22:31] <xec> Scretchy: pastebin is something like jsfiddle.net
[06:22:39] <Scretchy> oh sry
[06:26:08] <Scretchy> http://onlinepaste.com/lHmJaBYh
[06:26:45] <Scretchy> it must be a problem with the selector
[06:26:59] <johndoez> i need help .. i have this wierd problem. i wanna send a json object via post to a iframe intact so i can read the json in the php in the iframe
[06:27:05] <Scretchy> sry in line 19 it is first-child instead of first
[06:27:39] <beancurd> Scretchy: have you tried changing .val() to .html() or .text() in line 19?
[06:28:08] <Scretchy> yes the same problem
[06:28:15] <xec> .val() is correct if it is a <select>
[06:28:33] <johnkpaul> I don't believe :first is a calid seletor
[06:28:33] <beancurd> xec: i thought he was trying to get a <td>
[06:28:37] <johnkpaul> valid*
[06:28:40] <johnkpaul> ?:first
[06:28:55] <beancurd> he/she
[06:29:27] <Scretchy> i got the problem
[06:29:38] <beancurd> wd.
[06:29:40] <beancurd> what was it?
[06:29:42] <xec> johnkpaul: it is, but i'm not sure it's what Scretchy is after http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[06:29:49] <Scretchy> line 6 takes a time to install the object
[06:29:56] <Scretchy> because there is a db connection
[06:30:06] <beancurd> heh.
[06:30:10] <Scretchy> the object doesnt exist
[06:30:10] <Scretchy> an if i bind the event handler
[06:30:11] <johnkpaul> oh I see, thanks xec
[06:30:20] <ParanoidGal> Could this players code be customised to allow for four different instances? http://www.billiemyers.com/demo-04.htm
[06:30:20] <johndoez> i need help .. i have this wierd problem. i wanna send a json object via post to a iframe intact so i can read the json in the php in the iframe
[06:30:54] <johnkpaul> ParanoidGal: you just brough back so many memories of the late 90s
[06:31:06] <johnkpaul> mainly surrounding the massively popular, kiss the rain
[06:31:42] <johnkpaul> ParanoidGal: you mean can you have 4 jplayer instances on the same page?
[06:31:49] <ParanoidGal> lol i know johnkpaul I've been in a constant time warp since I started on the site
[06:32:12] <ParanoidGal> Yes. At the moment they're all playing the same tune which is kind of .... wrong
[06:32:16] <Scretchy> has anyone an idea to solve the problem without put in the  bind function in line 18 to both parts in the if part
[06:32:18] <johnkpaul> yeah, this is almost as good as working on hootie and the blowfish's website or something
[06:32:32] <dabear> ParanoidGal: you cannot have two divs with the same ID in html
[06:33:00] <johnkpaul> ah, dabear, I was looking for something like that
[06:33:03] <johnkpaul> didn't notice it
[06:33:13] <ParanoidGal> dabear trust me to miss the obvious!
[06:33:47] <johnkpaul> johndoez: is this for some cross domain issue?
[06:35:13] <xec> johndoez: we're going to need more information, what you just said doesn't make too much sense, as you can't "post to an iframe" - you post to an url, and you can't "read json in the php in the iframe" because iframe is client side and php is server side
[06:35:20] <johndoez> not really
[06:35:40] <johndoez> im trying to post some json object/array to iframe so the iframe can send me back file for download
[06:36:00] <xec> why the iframe?
[06:36:32] <johnkpaul> oh I see, because that's how you can force a save as dialog
[06:36:39] <johndoez> as far as i know ... dont really know any other method that works.. for [button] click to download a file without opening a new window
[06:36:58] <johnkpaul> johndoez: http://ajaxpatterns.org/IFrame_Call
[06:37:01] <xec> right, what johnkpaul said
[06:37:43] <johnkpaul> follow those instructions
[06:37:50] <johnkpaul> and look into the content disposition to force the save as
[06:37:55] <johnkpaul> it's a header you have to send
[06:37:56] <johnkpaul> from your php
[06:37:58] <johndoez> i have tried similar methods.. the json get stringified.
[06:38:44] <johndoez> i can code the php part well. it just the javascript im having a hard time sending the json data without it going crazy
[06:39:18] <johnkpaul> "the json get stringified" is a problem?
[06:39:52] <johnkpaul> if you look in the example that I sent, it uses javascript to update some form values in a hidden form, and then submits that with the target of the iframe
[06:39:57] <johndoez> let say i have object like  [{1,2,2,3,34,2},{2,3,3,42,2},{3,3,3,4,4}]
[06:39:59] <johnkpaul> what you need to do is put your json into one of those hidden inputs
[06:40:11] <johnkpaul> ok
[06:40:21] <johndoez> they end up on the other side as 1,2,2,3,34,2,2,3,3,42,2,3,3,3,4,4
[06:40:36] <johndoez> that's basically wat i did.
[06:40:45] <johnkpaul> are you sure you're using POST?
[06:40:50] <johndoez> yup
[06:41:47] <johnkpaul> try urlencoding it
[06:41:54] <johnkpaul> ?mdn encodeURIComponent
[06:42:01] <johnkpaul> ?g encodeURIComponent
[06:42:09] <johnkpaul> :( bot-t where ar eyou
[06:42:20] <johndoez> i did. is there a way to preserve the [{},{}] and just put them into a string
[06:42:31] <johndoez> i can just recode them in php
[06:43:17] <deiu> Quick question: is there a way to have a jQuery call to an external script that does some mysql work (on the same domain)?
[06:43:31] <johnkpaul> johndoez: http://xkr.us/articles/javascript/encode-compare/
[06:43:38] <johnkpaul> I never remember which one is which
[06:43:53] <johnkpaul> deiu: that is what jQuery.ajax is there for
[06:45:18] <deiu> johnkpaul, but what if it has to submit a form?
[06:45:38] <deiu> say I have a form and on the submit button I add a jquery onClick event
[06:46:13] <johnkpaul> yes, that's possible
[06:46:22] <johnkpaul> deiu: http://www.charlieperrins.com/2011/03/ajax-jquery-101/

[06:48:16] <beancurd> ?
[06:48:25] <johnkpaul> I blame you completely, and now I'm stopping
[06:49:53] <Kottizen> beancurd: 15:19:38 < beancurd> Kottizen: how are you invoking the ajax req?
[06:50:03] <Kottizen> beancurd: the request is sent as soon as the page is ready
[06:54:09] <n00by> this maaay be off-topic, but did anyone manage to get http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ working with bootstrap
[06:54:16] <ParanoidGal> Thanks for pointing out the obvious guys. Got the players working perfectly. Time to go back to the 90s for a while!
[06:54:29] <n00by> I want to know if there's a fix, or should I roll up my sleeves and dig deep
[06:54:55] <ParanoidGal> johnkpaul And how are you finding it joining me in this 90s timewarp? ;)
[06:55:22] <johnkpaul> ha, it's a lot of fun, but I shouldn't be admitting that to a publically logged IRC channel
[06:55:42] <johnkpaul> I need to find out if I get VH1 and watch I <3 the 90's
[06:55:51] <beancurd> Kottizen: ah, are you able to get it to work in ie if you invoke it using a click/link? might help narrow the problem.
[06:56:35] <johnkpaul> n00by: isn't there a twitter bootstrap channel
[06:56:54] <n00by> johnkpaul, sorry, I wasn't aware of that  =)
[06:56:55] <johnkpaul> they might know better there
[06:57:19] <johnkpaul> :) ##twitter-bootstrap
[06:57:34] <n00by> johnkpaul, yep, I googled it out now
[06:57:36] <ParanoidGal> No I'm glad I have the excuse of doing her site so I have an excuse to do "research"..
[06:57:38] <n00by> thanx anyway

[06:59:35] <nenolod> hi, so, i'm having a problem
[07:00:45] <nenolod> i have an <a> inside of a hidden popup menu, jquery can find it by id when it's hidden, but when i call .click(function (event) { ... }); on it, the event is not firing
[07:01:04] <nenolod> any suggestions on debugging?
[07:01:12] <johnkpaul> nenolod: when you call click with a function as a parameter, it does not fire
[07:01:19] <johnkpaul> it just adds it to the list of event handlers
[07:01:26] <johnkpaul> if you want it to fire immediately...
[07:01:30] <nenolod> yes, i understand this
[07:01:31] <nenolod> i mean
[07:01:32] <johnkpaul> .click(callbackFunction).trigger("click")
[07:01:35] <nenolod> it doesn't fire when i click on it
[07:01:38] <cortexman> could I get a hand on this syntax? http://jsfiddle.net/ysXzn/ errs: Uncaught Error: NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM Exception 8 on line 6371 of 1.7.1/jquery.js

[07:02:17] <antgel> hi all, on the basis that this is the right place for jstree support (not #javascript?)
[07:02:22] <antgel> well, hi anyway :)

[07:02:42] <johnkpaul> nenolod: please make a jsfiddle example
[07:02:45] <nenolod> sure
[07:02:45] <beancurd> np.
[07:03:45] <johnkpaul> antgel: you can try in here, but very specific questions about jquery plugins don't always have people with enough knowledge to help effectively
[07:03:52] <johnkpaul> jstree is a jqplugin, no?
[07:04:16] <johnkpaul> cortexman: .map returns an array of strings

[07:06:51] <rickibalboa> nenolod, question, is this hidden popup being inserted by javascript? you may have to use .live('click', funct...
[07:06:52] <johnkpaul> ah, so it is an array-like pseudo jquery object
[07:06:57] <Scretchy> Hello. How can i read out the text of a option element? <td><select><option>Hello</option><option....</option></select></td>. I got the ID of the td an wants the text of the selected option. Not the value. tmp = $(element).children(":first-child > option:selected").html();
[07:07:01] <cortexman> oh i read about that. thanks
[07:07:01] <johnkpaul> cortexman: you can use Array.prototype.join
[07:07:06] <cortexman> oh no i didn't. thanks!
[07:07:18] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[07:07:37] <xarxer> :)
[07:08:26] <johnkpaul> cortexman: .toArray().join
[07:08:26] <dabear> cortexman: if "cats" is a jquery object, cats.get().join("") should work
[07:08:28] <johnkpaul> will work
[07:08:47] <Scretchy> tmp = $(element).children(":first-child").children("option:selected").html(); fixes the problem
[07:08:47] <Scretchy> thx
[07:10:50] <InterMedio_> Hello everybody. I want make pagination with AJAX support and when I click on pagination block, I get full html page in block '#content',  but I need inner of the block '#content'. How I do it? Please help. Code here http://pastebin.com/MGfMvSp4
[07:12:01] <FernandoBasso> I have a little piece of code (from the web, actually) to make columns equal height, but the <secion> goes far to the bottom, while 'nav' is always a little short. Also, since the pages are loaded with javascript, it only works from pages loaded directly. http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/BadSites/ (my localhost)
[07:12:36] <nenolod> rickibalboa: no
[07:12:45] <nenolod> rickibalboa: it is hidden inside the dom
[07:12:58] <nenolod> rickibalboa: the JS just copies it from another part of the DOM
[07:13:08] <nenolod> ...oh, duh.
[07:13:10] <rickibalboa> yeah well that could be your problem
[07:13:44] <rickibalboa> nenolod, unless you re-bind the click events when a new DOM element is added, or you can use .live(), and there are a few other methods, .delegate() or something
[07:14:13] <antgel> johnkpaul-afk: sure, jstree requires jquery although it's not a plugin as such
[07:16:25] <cortexman> cool, here's the before / after code..complexity melting away! http://jsfiddle.net/ysXzn/1/
[07:20:18] <dabear> cortexman: I think you can do .bind("mouseover", false)
[07:20:41] <cortexman> yes, tx.
[07:21:00] <cortexman> i think sometimes the examples i find are outdated
[07:22:04] <dabear> hm, can't get it working
[07:22:06] <dabear> never mind
[07:22:52] <dabear> it works
[07:23:56] <BillyJoe> I'm usually do not develop the front-end part, but now I have to do it, and I need some advice. On the server I have an array of objects with 4 variables (boolean, string and integer). On the front-end, all the array items will be displayed in a list. That part is easy. However, I need to add a textbox that automatically filters what is displayed to the end user. If the user enters "J", only
[07:23:56] <BillyJoe> the array items with the string variable containing a "J" should be displayed. All data will be available client-side. Should I use a javascript "Array()" for the data? Also, what is the easiest/best way to filter the html using jquery?
[07:24:08] <BillyJoe> that was a long post, hope someone reads it :)
[07:26:09] <dabear> BillyJoe: serialize to json (e.g. echo json_encode($arr) in php)
[07:26:17] <dabear> then use jquery ui autocomplete
[07:26:30] <dabear> and set it to use that json object
[07:27:03] <dabear> as its "data source"
[07:27:14] <BillyJoe> dabear do you mean this? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[07:27:38] <dabear> is there any other projects names jquery ui and that also has an autocomplete?
[07:27:42] <dabear> I think not :p
[07:28:41] <dabear> $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ source: <?php echo json_encode($array)?>});
[07:28:49] <BillyJoe> dabear: probably not :) At first look it seems to solve the autocomplete part for the textbox itself, but does it also solve the filtering in the list? (Let's say I have a table that initially displays all array items, this table should be filtered on the fly)
[07:30:01] <dabear> not quite sure what you meant by filtering the list
[07:30:03] <dabear> what list
[07:30:09] <cortexman> so.. am I to understand that, i.e., this cookie plugin was deleted, and does not exist anymore? http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2010/09/jquery-cookies-getsetdelete-plugin.html
[07:30:51] <cortexman> wouldn't there have been backups on archive.org, or google cache, etc?
[07:31:07] <cortexman> (of all the deleted plugins)
[07:31:30] <dabear> BillyJoe: there is not pre-made solution that does everyting for you. filtering your self would be as easy as .hide()-ing all the list items, then .show()-ing those list items that match the value of the text box
[07:31:58] <BillyJoe> dabear .hide and .show is probably what I'm looking for, thanks!
[07:32:18] <dabear> BillyJoe: and .filter and .find
[07:33:42] <yannickoo> hey guys
[07:33:54] <yannickoo> can anybody tell me how i can fadein them from bottom to top? http://i.yannickoo.de/
[07:33:55] <Scretchy> Hello. How can i go through every element with an specific selector to add any information to it?
[07:34:24] <yannickoo> that's the whole magic: http://pastebin.com/zt0DP9QQ
[07:34:24] <dabear> does anyone remember a web site that given an input string, would shift each character of that string by 13 chars? what's the name for doing that?
[07:34:26] <BillyJoe> dabear .find with .each and a callback to hide/show with just a few lines of code without a loop I guess. Well, I will check it up and come back if there's something else I need to ask about.
[07:36:39] <kolix> hey guys
[07:36:43] <deiu> Quick question: is there a way to automatically escape single quotes when passing a string to a jQuery variable?
[07:37:02] <kolix> is there jquery exception handling for testing to see if a browser supports ajax?
[07:37:38] <dabear> deiu: no, and why would you ever need to do that
[07:37:40] <dabear> ?
[07:37:40] <deiu> onClick="myfunction('blah blah 'QUOTED TEXT' blah blah')"
[07:38:05] <dabear> deiu: never use onclick=""
[07:38:11] <dabear> USE EVENT HANDLERS

[07:43:39] <dabear> Scretchy: how can i fix my car but not at the same time?
[07:44:18] <yannickoo> polishguy94: right
[07:44:27] <Scretchy> 		$("#clientInfoFragment-1 [editable]").html("<input name=\"" + $("#clientInfoFragment-1 [editable]").attr('editable')  + "\"></input>");
[07:44:31] <yannickoo> polishguy94: it's error

[09:45:27] <supirole> min|dvir|us - You're not calling any JS on your html ... I'm not an expert. But don't you have to add <scrip src="your_script.js"></script> or something like that?
[09:45:44] <min|dvir|us> supirole: it's JSfiddle.
[09:46:00] <min|dvir|us> The JS is getting run. See the JS console.
[09:46:01] <min|dvir|us> There's an error.
[09:47:03] <Wilornel> Is it possible to look up for something by it's name attribute/
[09:47:03] <Wilornel> ?
[09:47:23] <min|dvir|us> Wilornel: $('[name="foo-bar"]');
[09:47:51] <Wilornel> Thanks a ton
[09:48:15] <Whirl3d> Mornin' all. Quick javascript question for y'all. When can I add parameters to a callback function? Do I have to wrap it in an anonymouse function to add parameters? $(something).custom().done(callback(param)); or do I have to do $(something).custom().done(function () {callback(param)});
[09:48:33] <supirole-back> I can't see no error min|dvir|us
[09:48:36] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: yes, you have to wrap in a function.
[09:48:54] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: callback(param) means call the callback.
[09:49:03] <supirole-back> sorry, I'm not that experienced...
[09:49:17] <Whirl3d> drats. Thanks for the reply min|dvir|us.
[09:49:24] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: no drats.
[09:49:29] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: it makes perfect sense.
[09:49:38] <ParanoidGal> Can anyone see how I can make both play and pause appear on the first player as opposed to one of the other http://www.billiemyers.com/demo-05.htm
[09:49:44] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: when you put () after a function, that means "call the function and get the return value".
[09:50:00] <min|dvir|us> If the return value of callback(param) is another function, then you could do that.
[09:50:13] <Whirl3d> Except if its wrapped in another function.
[09:50:28] <Whirl3d> I see that.
[09:50:28] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: because the callback is of an incompatible form.
[09:50:43] <min|dvir|us> Change the callback, or use the anonymous function.
[09:50:53] <min|dvir|us> Anonymous functions are beautiful anyway.
[09:50:57] <Whirl3d> will do. Thanks for your help.
[09:51:06] <Whirl3d> I just end up with a lot of them.
[09:51:40] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: you can have named function expressions if that's a bother.
[09:51:46] <Whirl3d> I would like to imply a parameter on a callback. Like addSection(sectionName).done(loadSection)
[09:52:00] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: anonymous function.
[09:52:22] <supirole-back> min|dvir|us - Do you know where i may find the class that determines the accordion height?
[09:52:29] <min|dvir|us> Nope.
[09:52:32] <Wilornel> How to get the name of all the inputs on the page?
[09:52:35] <Whirl3d> addSection(sectioName).done(function () {loadSection(sectionName);}) is just not as pretty. LOL
[09:52:52] <Whirl3d> min|dvir|us, thansks for the info.
[09:54:09] <Wilornel> How to get the name of all the inputs on the page?
[09:55:04] <Whirl3d> err. wait. In my addSection function, I return a deferred object that is resolved when the section is initialized but not loaded. So perhaps, even when I know the section exists, I could call addSection...which checks the deferred and loads the same content if the deferred is resolved.

[10:06:43] <min|dvir|us> Can someone help me figure out what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/JsHaV/
[10:07:51] <Whirl3d> where is complete defined originally?
[10:08:15] <shoky> min|dvir|us: $.each(elements
[10:08:15] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: just follow the code.
[10:08:33] <min|dvir|us> shoky: no, that is a different each.
[10:08:35] <shoky> er sorry
[10:08:44] <Whirl3d> I did. The second part of your conditional phrase for the complete callback resolves to complete...which is not defined?
[10:09:10] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: it is, see the definition for pulse().
[10:11:00] <Whirl3d> do you have to define a local variable for $(this) before your intner function
[10:11:28] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: there is no reason to have the "innerCss" closure

[10:11:43] <gnarf> there could be i suppose
[10:11:51] <Whirl3d> <-works
[10:11:52] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: $(elements).each().
[10:12:13] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: well, there is no reason to set these "next animations" as callbacks
[10:12:17] <gnarf> you could just queue them
[10:12:34] <Whirl3d> I think with the inner closure, your reference to $(this) is lost
[10:12:57] <shoky> ^^ yes
[10:12:58] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: 1) I am against queueing; 2) even if I queue I still have to set a callback on one of them so the maximum stack size isn't exceeded.
[10:13:00] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: inside the each you could just var cssParts = css.slice( 0 ); // get a copy instead of everyone referencing the same thing
[10:13:03] <shoky> this points to the window object
[10:13:08] <shoky> min|dvir|us: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/JsHaV/2/
[10:13:25] <min|dvir|us> shoky: very nice, thanks.
[10:13:30] <Whirl3d> wat!
[10:14:19] <shoky> right, Whirl3d did post a solution first :)
[10:14:35] <min|dvir|us> shoky was the first to prove it. :P
[10:14:46] <Whirl3d> shoky, thanks. That was sweet. I posted a fiddle too, btw
[10:15:08] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: http://jsfiddle.net/JsHaV/3/
[10:15:09] <min|dvir|us> You totally did.
[10:15:16] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d gets all the credit.
[10:15:33] <Whirl3d> It's a group effeort
[10:15:39] <Whirl3d> effort*
[10:15:55] <shoky> ?noop
[10:15:56] <bot-t> jQuery.noop(): An empty function. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noop/
[10:16:12] <min|dvir|us> That's pretty useful.
[10:16:21] <shoky> i'll go use it
[10:16:29] <min|dvir|us> part, innerCss
[10:16:30] <min|dvir|us> What?
[10:16:32] <min|dvir|us> You can do that?
[10:16:42] <shoky> huh?
[10:16:48] <min|dvir|us> shoky: gnarf's example.
[10:16:53] <min|dvir|us> var part, innerCss = css.slice(0);
[10:16:54] <shoky> var a, b = 5;
[10:16:55] <shoky> ?
[10:16:59] <gnarf> the part wasn't needed
[10:17:12] <gnarf> i was gonna part = css.shift() , but never used it
[10:17:12] <min|dvir|us> What the hell is part?
[10:17:25] <gnarf> realized it was temp, and forgot to get rid of the the var
[10:17:29] <sigurding> guys anyone here working with backbone.js?
[10:17:38] <min|dvir|us> Oh, I see.
[10:17:53] <marke> sigurding: #documentcloud
[10:17:53] <min|dvir|us> I'm still used to Python's tuple expansion syntax.
[10:18:10] <sigurding> marke: thanks
[10:18:43] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: .animate() has built in queueing
[10:18:52] <min|dvir|us> Yeah, but I really dislike it.
[10:18:54] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: so like, you can just call 3 .animate()'s
[10:19:06] <gnarf> there is zero reason to use the complete callback to handle that
[10:19:25] <min|dvir|us> The queuing goes against the nature of JS.
[10:19:31] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: ?
[10:19:43] <min|dvir|us> I want to do things all at once, unless there's a callback.
[10:19:51] <min|dvir|us> I want to set multiple animations at once, for example.
[10:20:21] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: also, since you were using an each, it already gave you a closure, that inner closure wasn't needed
[10:20:42] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: use multiple queues then
[10:20:44] <Whirl3d> anyone know of a fancy (or just more eloquent) way to handle this: I run into this alot: var elem=$("#"+sel).lenght?$("#"+sel):$("<div id='"+selector+"'/>).appendTo("body"));
[10:20:50] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: or callbacks. :)
[10:21:00] <min|dvir|us> Callbacks are the only sane way to solve this problem.
[10:21:29] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: except my code is smaller, and less complex by using the queue, which is basically the "default callback" - run the next queued animate
[10:21:46] <gnarf> it also couldn't be interrupted by someone else calling .animate() on the same thing
[10:21:57] <gnarf> the animation you queue will complete because they are all on the queue
[10:22:24] <gnarf> maybe I'm just biased from like you know, maintaining jQuery UI Effects / working on jQuery core effects.js
[10:23:19] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: I don't hold it against you, I'm biased myself.
[10:23:53] <min|dvir|us> (01:21:29 PM) gnarf: min|dvir|us: except my code is smaller, and less complex by using the queue, which is basically the "default callback" - run the next queued animate
[10:23:57] <min|dvir|us> That's where you convinced me.
[10:24:01] <Schyzo> Hello all
[10:24:17] <min|dvir|us> Particularly the 'the queue, which is basically the "default callback" - run the next queued animate' part.
[10:24:50] <Schyzo> I have an issue with an ajax call I make, which works on FF and IE9 but not chrome... The request is seen as "pending" and eventually times out...
[10:24:57] <Schyzo> Is there something I miss ?
[10:25:22] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L384-397
[10:26:30] <gnarf> quite literally - it is the default complete :)
[10:27:09] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: wouldn't complete: overwrite it?
[10:28:04] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: in jQuery.speed ( which animate passes its arguments to to get an "options" object ) - it will set opt.old to the old complete function, then calls that before jQuery.dequeue( this, opt.queue )
[10:28:50] <gnarf> so regarless of what you pass for "complete" - jQuery makes a complete function to call yours first, then dequeue the next animation
[10:28:52] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: I don't have quite the understanding of the jQuery API yet.
[10:29:03] <min|dvir|us> (The queueing and dequeueing.)

[10:32:26] <shoky> var elem = $('#'+sel); if (!elem.length) elem = $('<div id=' + selector + '
[10:32:29] <shoky> oops
[10:33:20] <shoky> Whirl3d: less fancy, more eloquent imo:  var elem = $('#'+sel); if (!elem.length) elem = $('<div id="' + selector + '"/>).appendTo('body');
[10:33:46] <Whirl3d> Shoky, thanks. That's how I have been doing it, I was hoping for a var elem=$("#"+sel)||newElem(sel);
[10:34:32] <shoky> (elem=$('#'+sel)).length || elem = $(...)
[10:34:33] <shoky> :\
[10:34:48] <gnarf> thats not more elegant, its just harder to read
[10:34:51] <shoky> ^^
[10:35:37] <gnarf> more elegant is turning that whole thing into function findOrCreate( id ) { ...; return elem; }
[10:35:46] <gnarf> and then only writing the code for it once
[10:35:56] <Whirl3d> good point.
[10:36:24] <Whirl3d> presuming the invocation is identical for your elements.
[10:36:37] <gnarf> even more elegant is investigating your use case for that function
[10:36:45] <gnarf> Whirl3d: findOrCreate( id, callback ) then
[10:36:50] <gnarf> and call the callback on create
[10:37:12] <gnarf> if the use case is you know you will be creating it the first time, then reusing it forever
[10:37:39] <gnarf> then instead, just make a var myElem = $("<div>").appendTo("body"); in the outer scope and reuse it
[10:38:39] <Whirl3d> So, gnarf, how do you approach this; I have a site with 5 sections, Each section has 5 pages (give or take) and each "page" element's content is in a separate html document that I load dynamically.
[10:38:47] <Whirl3d> It's not a lot of content.
[10:39:11] <Whirl3d> Do you recycle a single div for your content holder, or do you just load them in to nested divs based on section/page
[10:39:35] <Whirl3d> There are visual elements unique to each section, and the page elements have their own visual styles.
[10:39:47] <gnarf> Whirl3d: I likely try first to get my output html to include everything I'll need if its just "static" content
[10:40:23] <gnarf> Whirl3d: forgoing that - I'd probably just seed it with "empty divs" in the html that I popluate with an ajax request on the first "load" of that page
[10:42:00] <Whirl3d> Cool. that's how I am doing it. I load the static content for each section when the section Loads. And I have blank divs for each section. I don't worry about unloading the crap because it's not a lot of material total.
[10:42:15] <shoky> and because then you'd have to reload it
[10:42:24] <Whirl3d> yeah.
[10:42:55] <Whirl3d> thanks, as always, for the insights gnarf, shoky, min|dvir|us
[10:44:32] <ML74> I'm trying to have a div fade out on top of all my content. Using the code 	setTimeout(function(){ jQuery("#startanim").fadeOut('slow') }, 10000);
[10:44:32] <ML74> but doesn't seem to be working. Just fades out immediately :/
[10:45:08] <shoky> that sounds odd
[10:45:16] <gnarf> ?demo @ML74
[10:45:17] <bot-t> ML74, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[10:45:34] <Wilornel> Guys, so you see, I have lots of divs on my webpage.. And I want that when the user clicks one of them, The info which is in the clicked links goes to some other place
[10:45:42] <ML74> you'll see the big red background as it loads just disappears without fade
[10:45:47] <Wilornel> How can I get the info of all the elements in a div
[10:45:47] <Wilornel> ?
[10:46:01] <Wilornel> div['img']['src']?
[10:47:52] <ML74> fixed
[10:48:41] <thebignoise> http://jsfiddle.net/3n4nP/ this works on the mousedown but not up
[10:48:44] <thebignoise> can someone tell me why?
[10:49:12] <shoky> works on mouseup for e
[10:49:14] <shoky> for me
[10:49:57] <gnarf> thebignoise: select elements have some strange behavior with mouse events - likely because by the time "mouseup" occurs its happening on the options instead of the select
[10:50:29] <thebignoise> gnarf: im trying to capture the value before they change it
[10:50:41] <thebignoise> and then capture the one they changed to
[10:51:31] <dabear> thebignoise: why?
[10:51:39] <gnarf> thebignoise: thebignoisehttp://jsfiddle.net/3n4nP/1/ - id look into focus and change
[10:52:01] <gnarf> thebignoise: that should handle keyboard interaction also
[10:52:11] <thebignoise> gnarf: okay very cool thank you

[11:49:54] <Schyzo> Moreover, chrome says the request is "pending"
[11:50:12] <gob> you've got a template variable as the url in there, you sure it's rendering correctly?
[11:51:10] <Schyzo> gob: yep, rendered as url : '/menuBar/',
[11:51:29] <Schyzo> This code works with IE9 and FF as well
[11:51:35] <gob> add an error handler to the request, inspect the error obj

[11:52:30] <shwaiil> hi
[11:52:35] <Schyzo> This is never reached, unless I reload the page
[11:53:02] <shoky> what is .ajaxForm
[11:53:19] <shwaiil> Q: If I have a form and do a .submit() and prevent default. how to make it proceed normaly ? I need to check some stuff trough ajax but then I would like the user to proceed as usual. how to do that ? tks
[11:53:24] <shoky> your .ajax request has no error handler
[11:53:44] <Schyzo> ajaxForm is the jquery form plugin (http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#api)
[11:54:17] <shoky> it's the one making the request?
[11:54:20] <Schyzo> maybe I should have cleaned up the code
[11:54:22] <Schyzo> sorry
[11:54:22] <shoky> or updateLogin ?
[11:54:37] <Schyzo> updateLogin is called if the first call is successful
[11:54:51] <Schyzo> it is not the one that does not work
[11:55:21] <shoky> ok..
[11:56:25] <Schyzo> Sorry about that, here is a simplified version that has the same behavior : http://pastebin.com/eT3XxgZV
[11:56:48] <shoky> no idea about .ajaxForm sry
[11:57:31] <Schyzo> I will try to check if have the same behavior with the ajax function
[11:57:43] <Schyzo> thanks shoky and Gab
[12:00:30] <shwaiil> Q: Anyone know, how to proceed with a submit after a preventDefault ? Used this, for some ajax
[12:02:11] <shoky> shwaiil you can .submit() the form
[12:02:25] <shwaiil> shoky: thanks for looking =)
[12:02:49] <shoky> well i did answer ;p
[12:03:16] <shwaiil> shoky: let's say $(this).submit() ? :T
[12:03:28] <shoky> this.submit()
[12:03:37] <shoky> either i guess
[12:03:38] <shwaiil> but if I have $('theForm').submit()
[12:03:51] <shwaiil> if I do $(this).submit() that shouldnt work, right ?
[12:05:38] <shoky> $('#theForm').submit( function(e) { e.preventDefault(); this.submit(); } )
[12:07:34] <shoky> hmm
[12:11:27] <Scretchy> Hello, I use each to display all content of an object. how can i use the other variables in the callback? $.each(data, function(index, value){
[12:11:43] <shoky> you can just use them
[12:11:56] <Scretchy> other variables defined before
[12:11:59] <shoky> yes
[12:12:10] <shoky> if they are in scope you can use them
[12:12:19] <Scretchy> firebug says me it doestn exist
[12:12:29] <shoky> then it doesn't exist in the scope you're in
[12:12:41] <shoky> did you declare it in a seperate function
[12:13:21] <Scretchy> hmm it is very complicate because the mvc
[12:13:43] <shoky> maybe, but variable scope is pretty simple
[12:15:42] <Scretchy> http://onlinepaste.com/1OfanevJ
[12:15:48] <Scretchy> that is a litte part of my code
[12:15:56] <Scretchy> in the table there is no 1
[12:16:14] <shoky> huhhhh
[12:17:12] <shoky> what is that, jsp?
[12:17:25] <shoky> er
[12:17:28] <shoky> guess not
[12:17:36] <Scretchy> no
[12:17:42] <Scretchy> its a mvc
[12:17:53] <Scretchy> smarty
[12:18:11] <shoky> well i have no idea about that
[12:18:22] <shoky> but the javascript issue is simple
[12:19:34] <Scretchy> arg
[12:19:38] <shoky> and if you had that snippet in javascript, you'd be able to access that 'hello' var like you're doing
[12:19:44] <Scretchy> i got an fault in my sample
[12:20:01] <Scretchy> it must me <%= hello %>
[12:20:09] <Scretchy> then there is no problem
[12:20:19] <shoky> oK
[12:20:21] <Scretchy> in my code i use <%= this.order.status %>
[12:20:29] <Scretchy> i think the this is the problem
[12:20:31] <shoky> ok
[12:20:36] <shoky> you have to be careful with 'this'
[12:20:42] <Scretchy> ;-)
[12:20:49] <shoky> why not use 'value' instead ?
[12:21:12] <shoky> oh sorry
[12:21:18] <Scretchy> in the mvc i can speak to all the givven variables to the template with this.
[12:21:23] <shoky> before the $.each
[12:21:36] <Scretchy> value = this.order.status ?
[12:21:39] <Scretchy> i try it
[12:21:51] <shoky> do the equivalent of:   var smth = this;
[12:22:01] <shoky> then use smth.order.status inside the callback
[12:22:09] <shoky> cache 'this'
[12:22:14] <shoky> in a variable.
[12:22:16] <shoky> is the main point
[12:22:52] <Scretchy> hmm that operates
[12:23:07] <Scretchy> strange...
[12:23:10] <shoky> what./
[12:23:11] <shoky> ?
[12:23:37] <Scretchy> <% bla = this.order.status %> ... each .... <%=bla %>
[12:23:44] <shoky> works?
[12:23:48] <Scretchy> jea
[12:23:50] <shoky> good
[12:23:52] <shoky> it's not strange
[12:23:53] <Scretchy> fu*** this
[12:24:00] <shoky> 'this' can be changed inside a callback
[12:24:09] <shoky> $.each  changes 'this'
[12:24:35] <Scretchy> ok thank you!
[12:24:39] <shoky> np
[12:24:41] <Scretchy> jquery is so cool!
[12:24:46] <shoky> aye
[12:24:51] <shoky> but learn javascript first :)
[12:25:09] <Scretchy> ;-)
[12:26:00] <Logikos> jquery is the way javascript should be in my opnion ... i dont use js often but being able to use css selectors is vital...
[12:26:34] <shoky> javascript has nothing to do with css or selectors
[12:27:02] <Logikos> of course not, but often needs to reference the DOM
[12:27:11] <shoky> the DOM api is the problem, then
[12:27:18] <shoky> javascript is pretty cool. mostly
[12:27:19] <Logikos> so why not have a standard reference (which css already has)
[12:28:08] <shoky> the problem is not having the standard..
[12:28:13] <Logikos> the DOM doesnt have an api ... its just parsed?
[12:28:15] <Logikos> or no?
[12:28:18] <shoky> its not following the standard
[12:28:27] <shoky> what?
[12:28:30] <shoky> the DOM has an api..
[12:28:35] <shoky> html is parsed
[12:28:39] <shoky> into the TOM
[12:28:40] <shoky> DOM
[12:29:11] <Logikos> just but unless i'm wrong (which there is a nice chance thats the case) .. the DOM itself doesnt have an api
[12:29:19] <Logikos> javascript gives it an api...
[12:29:21] <shoky> yea so you're wrong..
[12:29:24] <Logikos> a way to navigate it...
[12:29:25] <shoky> nah
[12:29:30] <Scretchy> ok guys thank you, i have to code a lot today
[12:29:30] <shoky> the browser gives it an api
[12:30:04] <Logikos> so the browser prases the html and creates the DOM ... and offers an api by which javascript/css access it?
[12:30:22] <shoky> offers a javascript API by which js developers can access it
[12:30:42] <Logikos> that explains why useing raw javascript often doesnt work cross browser...
[12:30:51] <shoky> indeed
[12:30:53] <shoky> well
[12:31:01] <shoky> you mean raw DOM api
[12:31:03] <shoky> ;)
[12:32:03] <Logikos> at any rate, i greatly apricate the great lengths the jquery team has taken to allow us to use css type references to refer to nodes within the DOM
[12:32:20] <shoky> as do i
[12:33:36] <Logikos> it might not be a great place to talk about it, but i havent fooled arround with othe rlibrarys really ... how do other libs such as mootools etc compair?
[12:33:46] <Logikos> do they also offer the same css style selection methods
[12:34:01] <shoky> mootools does yes
[12:34:29] <shoky> but its a bit more verbose, but that's because mootools doesnt want to be just a DOM manipulation library
[12:34:56] <shoky> they claim different purposes
[12:35:03] <Logikos> oh?
[12:35:28] <shoky> jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development
[12:35:32] <Logikos> i've seen things here or there that require mootools .. but most things that require a lib usualy require jquery
[12:35:37] <Logikos> so i've stuck with jquery
[12:35:39] <shoky> MooTools is a compact, modular, Object-Oriented JavaScript framework designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer. It allows you to write powerful, flexible, and cross-browser code with its elegant, well documented, and coherent API.
[12:35:52] <johnkpaul> shoky: is taht from the docs?
[12:35:59] <johnkpaul> if you came up with tht on your own, that's amazin
[12:36:00] <shoky> its from the main page of each
[12:36:00] <johnkpaul> amazing*
[12:36:02] <shoky> ;)
[12:36:04] <johnkpaul> ah
[12:36:07] <shoky> haha
[12:36:15] <johnkpaul> IMHO, for working with the DOM, jQuery is the way to go
[12:36:19] <shoky> ++
[12:36:35] <michaeleisel> i want the links on this page: http://thesparkcollective.com/stuff.php to set the main image as themself when they are clicked upon. how can i do this?
[12:36:41] <johnkpaul> for a pure js codebase, dom aside, I'd use Prototype or uunderscore just for the utility functions
[12:36:41] <michaeleisel> *images, not links
[12:36:44] <johnkpaul> that jQuery doesnt' really provide
[12:37:17] <shoky> michaeleisel: yes
[12:37:20] <shoky> oh
[12:37:24] <johnkpaul> michaeleisel: your code is almost correct, attr doesn't take an obhj
[12:37:24] <shoky> didnt see the 'how'
[12:37:42] <johnkpaul> ?attr @whomp
[12:37:42] <bot-t> whomp, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:38:43] <tsavory> anyone willing to help me find out why Columnizer jQuery Plugin won't work in firefox but partly works in chrome and IE in my drupal 7 or have an idea on what else I could use to make the content split into columns ?
[12:38:57] <shoky> ;S
[12:39:05] <faraway> Columnizer jQuer
[12:39:30] <tsavory> http://heidisavory.com/?q=about
[12:41:14] <shoky> i hope she didnt author that description
[12:41:46] <johnkpaul> :D
[12:42:27] <whomp> how can i use the attr command to have an image set its path as the path for the main image
[12:42:36] <whomp> when that particular image is clicked upon
[12:42:41] <johnkpaul> tsavory: it seems like it works fine for me in FF 11 and Chrome 17
[12:42:45] <johnkpaul> what issues are you seeing?
[12:43:08] <johnkpaul> also, completely unrelated to your issue, that site really needs some design and copy love
[12:43:15] <f0rkn1ght> TLC
[12:43:16] <johnkpaul> whomp: I told you
[12:43:22] <johnkpaul> it doesn't take an object as a parameter
[12:43:24] <johnkpaul> it takes two strings
[12:43:32] <johnkpaul> did you read the docs? whomp
[12:43:36] <johnkpaul> ?attr @whomp
[12:43:36] <bot-t> whomp, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:43:54] <whomp> so what's the solution, then
[12:44:08] <johnkpaul> don't pass an object
[12:44:12] <johnkpaul> look at the examples on that page
[12:44:15] <shoky> whomp i like your nick. you shall stay here
[12:45:39] <johnkpaul> $("div.main img").attr("src",newsrc); @whomp
[12:46:12] <tsavory> johnkpaul in firefox it is not breaking at all and in the chrome if I make make it so its not a run on paragraph it does not put in the second column let me show you
[12:46:35] <johnkpaul> what version of FF tsavory?
[12:46:53] <johnkpaul> FF 11 on Snow Leopard seems fine, and breaks I assume correcly
[12:47:32] <tsavory> I am running 11.0 on windows 7 johnkpaul
[12:48:17] <johnkpaul> hmm, I don't know, tsavory
[12:48:24] <johnkpaul> tsavory: try to reduce it to a test case and submit a bug report is really all I can think of
[12:49:05] <tsavory> johnkpaul ok if you reload you can see in chrome in no longer shows the second column
[12:50:36] <johnkpaul> yes, now it does not, did you change something?
[12:53:02] <nprice> say i have a <img> with a class on it inside of an <li>, and the li has one class on it, and the img has another class on it, is there any way to access the img using the li's class?
[12:53:57] <quaa> Does anyone know of a marquee that I can update elements on the fly without it scrolling a crap ton of blank space?
[12:54:18] <tsavory> johnkpaul yeah I changed it from one run on paragraph to three separate paragraphs as it should be.
[12:54:52] <johnkpaul> tsavory: but you're using <br> not <p>
[12:54:53] <Zhy> $('.liclass').children('img') ?
[12:54:59] <Zhy> @nprice
[12:55:21] <nprice> sweet
[12:55:23] <nprice> thanks
[12:55:29] <nprice> didn't know .children() existed!@
[12:55:30] <Zhy> http://api.jquery.com/children/ you can look it up here :)
[12:56:47] <tsavory> If I use the <p> then it breaks each paragraph and that looks and reads bad to I will show you
[12:58:09] <tsavory> ok reload
[12:58:30] <johnkpaul> tsavory: so change the css to have it look as you would like
[12:58:51] <johnkpaul> I'm guessing that Columnizer is choking on the <br> and the one large tag
[12:58:55] <johnkpaul> because it can't tell where it could break it up
[12:59:07] <johnkpaul> compeltely a guess though, because I have no idea how Columnizer works
[12:59:19] <johnkpaul> but if it works with paragraph tags, and the problem is the spacing, just decrease the margin
[12:59:51] <shoky> quaa: just make your own
[13:02:57] <quaa> shoky: I'm thinking thats what I'm needing to do
[13:03:10] <quaa> shoky think i figured it out
[13:12:46] <tsavory> johnkpaul I am not finding the css  I find the classes in chrome since it rendered out but margins are at 0 and for some reason firefox is rendering for me
[13:26:04] <LekeFly> How can i do this http://cl.ly/020j3e0J2C050o0r1R3B ? What should i google to find something simlar..
[13:26:43] <shoky> o.o
[13:26:59] <shoky> pagination ?
[13:27:18] <LekeFly> shoky: No.. input to "select li" or something :p
[13:27:32] <shoky> wat
[13:27:44] <LekeFly> So selecting a qty updates a hidden input
[13:28:39] <LekeFly> shoky: Did that make sence? :p
[13:29:01] <shoky> $('li').click( function() { $('input').val( $(this).text() ) } )
[13:29:03] <shoky> ;p
[13:29:30] <LekeFly> shoky: wow.. thanks!:)
[13:29:41] <shoky> no idea if thats anything close to what you meant ;p

[13:30:52] <cortexman> am I basically not allowed to use css in order to get the benefits of jquery mobile's cross platform support?
[13:30:57] <cortexman> <a data-role="button" data-inline="true" id="instructions" style="width:100%;">Continue</a>
[13:31:00] <shoky> ok so you can work with what i wrote i gues...
[13:31:06] <cortexman> that renders at greater than 100% of the screen on firefox mobile on my device.
[13:32:12] <cortexman> which is problematic..i mean, i don't really have the testing platform available to me that they do..
[13:32:14] <shoky> no idea about mobile but i've always found 99% to work pretty great when 100% fucks up and i donno why
[13:32:16] <cortexman> so..wtf?
[13:32:22] <cortexman> ok
[13:33:43] <cortexman> that fix doesn't work...

[13:57:02] <hattorihanzo> using jquery's .load with a selector to get just the juice from the page i need
[13:57:31] <hattorihanzo> what should i do in the callback to exectue <script> tags that are within that juice dom
[13:58:38] <nascro> OK, duplicating the same function for hover and click seemed to solve the problem, but there's got to be a simpler way.
[14:08:09] <shoky> hattorihanzo i dunno if you can
[14:09:03] <shoky> oh but if they appear inside that juice then..... maybe?

[14:24:28] <Schyzo> Hello all
[14:24:46] <Schyzo> I have an issue with one of my ajax call that works with FF and IE but not with Chrome
[14:25:08] <Schyzo> For some reason, the request is not sent (seen as pending in chrome)
[14:25:26] <Schyzo> The code I use seems quite standard: http://pastie.org/3835811
[14:25:47] <Schyzo> I have spent hours on this, trying to figure out why Chrome would not send this request...
[14:25:56] <Schyzo> Does anyone would have any idea by any chance ?
[14:27:24] <Schyzo> This is driving me crazy and I don't know where else to look
[14:48:53] <johnkpaul> Schyzo: what version of chrome? it works fine in jsfiddle
[14:48:54] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/Bpvyx/
[14:49:43] <Schyzo> Hi johnkpaul !
[14:50:08] <Schyzo> Actually, I have found out that Chrome does not work as the other browsers when it comes to connections
[14:50:32] <Schyzo> I have a music player on my page that prevents the login from correctly working
[14:50:54] <Schyzo> I believe the issue is not the login function itself but the way I serve music to the jplayer instead...
[14:51:57] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know
[14:52:10] <johnkpaul> are you serving this locally using the file:// protocol?
[14:52:14] <johnkpaul> that's the only chrome-specific issue that I know of
[14:53:05] <Schyzo> Removing the jplayer from the page makes the login to function as expected. I serve the file through a php read file
[14:53:20] <Schyzo> This function should send 206 (Partial content) then 200
[14:53:30] <xenaxon> why does this not work:
[14:53:31] <xenaxon> 			$('.'+item_id+' h3').hide();
[14:53:33] <xenaxon> ??
[14:53:40] <Schyzo> but there is something not working somewhere... :(
[14:54:34] <xenaxon> I've corrected:
[14:54:36] <xenaxon> 			$('#'+item_id+' h3').show();
[14:54:41] <xenaxon> but it still doesnt work
[14:54:47] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @xenaxon
[14:54:47] <bot-t> xenaxon, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[14:55:11] <johnkpaul> Schyzo: there's not realy much info to go on, you're going to have to get into some debugging
[14:56:15] <Schyzo> yep I agree with you johnkpaul, I wonder what kind of debugging I should at that point though... Not sure what I should be looking for
[14:56:44] <johnkpaul> start removing code to end up with just this ajax login code and the jplayer
[14:56:58] <johnkpaul> and then start removing from the code surrounding the jplqyer
[15:01:12] <Schyzo> I am pretty sure the error lives within my function that returns the HTTP codes and the partial responses.
[15:01:21] <Schyzo> Plus it makes perfectly sense in that case.
[15:01:26] <Schyzo> I will investigate further
[15:01:31] <Schyzo> thanks for your help !
[15:01:39] <johnkpaul> no problem

[15:35:19] <nprice> i had no clue what to google for
[15:35:32] <nprice> and i'm trying to hack together my own resizer script with a cycle script
[15:35:34] <nprice> haha
[15:36:12] <Whirl3dOrd3r> You can still do what you want to do pretty easily. But supersized is pretty great.
[15:36:42] <nprice> this script is at 3.2.7
[15:36:44] <nprice> mine barely works
[15:36:48] <nprice> i'm gonna go with the mature one :P
[15:38:02] <Whirl3dOrd3r> I thnk they updated to include CSS transformations for hardware accellerated transitions in slides, but if they haven't you should also lookup CSS3 Trasnitions in GISThub or Google.
[15:44:50] <shoky> Whirl3d the queues are separate
[15:50:32] <shoky> bound to the elements
[15:54:27] <wodemaye_> http://jsfiddle.net/zalun/QsHw4/ http://jsfiddle.net/QsHw4/2614/ why does the first of these work but not the 2nd?
[15:54:38] <wodemaye_> (the stuff in getStaticJson lints fine)
[15:55:40] <Whirl3d> So, If I want to run two animations on two separate elements, I don't need to add Queue:false to get them to run relatively simultraneously?
[15:55:54] <wodemaye_> hahaha love oyur nick, Whirl3d0rd3r.
[15:56:00] <wodemaye_> is that you, Whirl3d ?
[15:56:13] <Whirl3d> Yeah. That's my alternate nick
[15:56:18] <wodemaye_> it's awesome.
[15:56:39] <Whirl3d> Thanks. I have the domain whirledorder.com but haven't done anything with it yet
[15:56:53] <shoky> Whirl3d nope
[15:57:35] <wodemaye_> hey, shoky what's up?
[15:57:39] <wodemaye_> how are you?
[15:57:46] <shoky> am ok. sup
[15:57:57] <Whirl3d> woodemaye, I think the parameter you want is success, not onSuccess
[15:58:58] <shoky> and Whirl3d, i doubt that animating a 0 length collection does much
[15:59:13] <shoky> to any queue
[16:00:06] <Whirl3d> I have been working on a function that animates using rates rather than times.
[16:01:04] <Whirl3d> Sometimes if you wan to animate something to a destination value, you want it to go from 0 to 1 in 100 seconds (for example) which shouldn't take 100 seconds if you element was already at .8
[16:02:41] <Whirl3d> shoky have you ever seen the Fuse animation engine for AS2? I wish someone had ported that to jquery.
[16:03:11] <shoky> nope
[16:04:19] <Whirl3d> You should check it out some time. It's at mosesSupposes.com It's an animation sequencing engine that does some really amazing things and is super easy to use. Granted jQuery's animate and Queue do most of what Fuse did, but the subtle differences are hard to reproduce
[16:05:12] <Whirl3d> like I wish that jquery's animate would allow for boolean properties. If you include a boolean, it should apply it on compplete of the animation
[16:06:07] <shoky> that just sounds like sugar
[16:06:20] <Whirl3d> sugar?
[16:06:40] <shoky> include a boolean so it sets it when the animation is complete?
[16:07:32] <Whirl3d> in other words, $("div").animate({opacity:0, display:"none"})  (though not boolean, not scalar, so display none is applied at end)
[16:07:52] <varrg_> I am doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/zhmsK/ and see how it's first a string and then a html image element, how come?
[16:07:58] <shoky> Whirl3d that just looks wrong
[16:08:24] <KwikkSilva> argles
[16:08:30] <Whirl3d> or $("div").animate({class:"animated", opacity:0}, 5000) would set/add the class "animated at complete of the animation
[16:08:36] <shoky> no indication that one property is the actual animation and the other one is for 'change on completion'
[16:08:38] <KwikkSilva> i will literally pay someone to help me with these issues
[16:08:53] <shoky> er ahm
[16:09:00] <shoky> eunghhh
[16:09:07] <xmaddness> dont you have to pass the animation type too? like swing?
[16:09:10] <Whirl3d> No, it indicates that those properties change in whole increments, not it scalar methods
[16:09:26] <xmaddness> ahh maybe not
[16:09:41] <Whirl3d> xmaddness, sorry I was talking about another animation engine.
[16:10:03] <xmaddness> ahh i c
[16:10:21] <Whirl3d> It also allows for initial parameters like "start-left" by setting those parameters before performing the animation
[16:10:26] <shoky> Whirl3d that's just different syntax mostly.. i don't see what the advantage is
[16:11:04] <shoky> why should something that happnes before the animation be a parameter of the animation
[16:11:22] <Whirl3d> It is part of the animation.
[16:11:29] <Whirl3d> It is the animations start point
[16:11:31] <shoky> you said before
[16:11:55] <shoky> nothing amazing from your examples, sorry ;)
[16:12:06] <shoky> i'll check it out
[16:13:02] <Whirl3d> shoky, I wasn't trying to impress you. I was just pointing out the subtle differences. It's a matter of personal taste and experience with what you are familiar with. I just thought it was an interesting point of view to consider when evaluating animation
[16:13:35] <shoky> i thought so too, and considered, and told you my opinions ;)
[16:13:54] <Whirl3d> I created my own tweening class to handle animations the way that I like to do them, which is probably pretty backwards for most
[16:14:12] <shoky> nothing wrong with that, personal style ftw
[16:14:26] <shoky> unless you want others to do smth with it ;P
[16:14:42] <Whirl3d> I dare them.
[16:14:43] <Whirl3d> LOL
[16:14:50] <shoky> ;]
[16:15:21] <Whirl3d> If somebody sees fit to trudge through my bloated and blown out code to snag some insight into how NOT to do something. that's cool.
[16:15:55] <shoky> lol
[16:16:40] <Whirl3d> No, the truth of the matter is that I never finish anything. I just refactor and refactor and refactor and then, 5 minutes before deadline, I kludge a bunch of shit together, submit it and everyone loves it.
[16:17:07] <Whirl3d> Obviously I work for myself.
[16:19:30] <shoky> heh
[16:19:37] <shoky> im looking through that moses fuse site
[16:19:37] <imsky> mmmderp
[16:19:42] <shoky> it's not very user friendly
[16:19:43] <shoky> the site
[16:19:54] <shoky> cant find shit. demos, features, i donno
[16:19:58] <shoky> just pdfs
[16:20:01] <Whirl3d> It was supposed to be taken down several years ago.
[16:20:01] <shoky> comon
[16:20:30] <shoky> berp
[16:21:05] <Elter> Hey guys. Anyone feeling helpfull today? :)
[16:21:23] <shoky> not you, so far
[16:21:59] <Whirl3d> I've been trying to encapsulate the fuse animation like they did where you could predefine your "fuses" and apply targets to them to animate elements or groups of elements.
[16:22:26] <Whirl3d> Elter, what's your question?
[16:22:39] <shoky> that doesnt say much to me without a sample
[16:23:04] <shoky> oh, just grouping?>
[16:25:22] <Elter> I was wondering if it is possible to wire my webpage up so that the body background-color changes depending on where you are on the page (vertically).
[16:25:40] <KwikkSilva> shoky, if i wanted to get someone to review some issues i was having (paid) - where would i try - eLance?
[16:25:47] <Whirl3d> Elter, yes
[16:25:53] <Elter> Its a one-page website btw.
[16:26:21] <shoky> KwikkSilva try #css-lance
[16:26:23] <Elter> I've only managed to change the body bgcolor with buttons with onClick
[16:26:38] <Whirl3d> You need to create a background element that takes up the full screen and then create a mousemove handler that relates y position to color
[16:26:46] <min|dvir|us> Why is the first `complete` callback not running in pulseHeight()? http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/1/
[16:27:08] <rhino_> how can I search for the existance of a character in a string?
[16:28:02] <min|dvir|us> rhino_: 1) That's a ##javascript question. 2) haystack.indexOf(needle).
[16:28:27] <min|dvir|us> Elter: $(window).scroll(function(event) {});
[16:28:44] <Elter> ok, but is it easier if I got a jQuery viewport plugin installed? Because I already got one hooked up to my menu. But I'm clueless when it comes to javascript and jquery (got some help scripting the webside so far)
[16:29:03] <min|dvir|us> Elter: you're not going to get very much help here.
[16:29:11] <wodemaye_> does parseJSON(json_literal).json_array_name return a standard js array object?
[16:29:31] <min|dvir|us> wodemaye_: yes.
[16:29:35] <shoky> min|dvir|us: just a comment - you should return $this.each
[16:29:49] <whatthepoop> using draggable(), how come $(this).offset().left reports a different value than ui.offset.left when reporting it during each fire of the 'drag' event? the former is usually +1 than the latter, but when dragging quickly the difference grows. any clues?
[16:29:57] <min|dvir|us> shoky: ahh, yes, forgot the return. That's very important, thanks.
[16:30:24] <itatitat> ey guys
[16:30:27] <itatitat> I've a problem
[16:30:45] <itatitat> im loading new content by using Load
[16:30:48] <itatitat> the instruction
[16:31:19] <itatitat> is working, the problem is that....I need that some libraries of javascript can work with the new content
[16:31:46] <itatitat> now is not working, I think because of is "new content added after"
[16:31:53] <itatitat> but I dont know how to solve this problem
[16:31:56] <min|dvir|us> itatitat: nobody knows what you're talking about. Either post a link with what you're trying to say, or use JSfiddle.

[16:35:00] <shoky> don't think you're using apply() good
[16:35:27] <min|dvir|us> shoky: that fiddle doesn't solve the problem.
[16:35:29] * RandalSchwartz . o O ("good"?)
[16:35:45] <min|dvir|us> Also why are you passing arguments instead of args?
[16:35:49] <shoky> i didn't say it does
[16:35:56] <shoky> what, where?
[16:36:13] <min|dvir|us> There it is.
[16:36:15] <min|dvir|us> Solved my own problem.
[16:36:27] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/4/
[16:36:30] <shoky> i was just pointing out that $(element).animate.apply($this,...) doesnt depend on the elemtn
[16:36:31] <shoky> element
[16:36:32] <min|dvir|us> What does $() mean?
[16:36:38] <shoky> it's just an empty jquery obj
[16:36:50] <shoky> same as $('nonExistingTag')
[16:36:59] <min|dvir|us> Aha, an empty list pimped out by jQueryu.
[16:37:01] <min|dvir|us> *jQuery
[16:37:15] <shoky> yez
[16:37:37] <min|dvir|us> That's interesting. I suppose I could also do jQuery.fn.animate.apply.
[16:37:57] <shoky> yes that would prolly be better
[16:38:50] <shoky> RandalSchwartz: sue me
[16:39:56] <shoky> as long as you come visit me in prison to teach me perl
[16:40:20] <shoky> and english, if you must
[16:40:25] <min|dvir|us> Have not fixed the problem. http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/5/
[16:40:44] <min|dvir|us> shoky: same thing as before.
[16:40:49] <RandalSchwartz> minidvirius ? ;)
[16:41:10] <min|dvir|us> RandalSchwartz: min.dvir.us.
[16:41:17] <shoky> min|dvir|us: what is complete.apply(this, args);
[16:41:18] <RandalSchwartz> min|dvir|us - how old were you when you selected that nick?
[16:41:23] <RandalSchwartz> I'm guessing younger than 16
[16:41:28] <wodemaye_> what does this mean? missing } after property list | json: getStaticJson() | /d2m3b/57/show/ (line 63, col 18)
[16:41:35] <wodemaye_> its in firebug.
[16:41:43] <wodemaye_> http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/57/
[16:41:44] <shoky> probably what it says ;S
[16:41:53] <xmaddness> run your json through a json validator
[16:42:05] <min|dvir|us> shoky: complete is an `animates` argument.
[16:42:40] <shoky> ohh righto
[16:43:00] <wodemaye_> xmaddness, i have, it's valid.
[16:43:15] <wodemaye_> but what is it referring to, shoky?
[16:43:27] <xmaddness> I think I misread that. Looks like your argument list is missing a }
[16:43:50] <wodemaye_> but which arg is it referring to?
[16:44:05] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/8hC2R/
[16:44:20] <itatitat> that's my problem
[16:44:33] <min|dvir|us> itatitat: ?
[16:44:37] <itatitat> tell me
[16:44:41] <min|dvir|us> It's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
[16:44:48] <wodemaye_> itatitat, gimme one sec.
[16:44:55] <itatitat> yes......but is impossible....................im using php too....
[16:45:06] <wodemaye_> xmaddness, should i add it into the return val of getStaticJson(()?
[16:45:17] <shoky> min|dvir|us: why are you doing  $this.each()  and for each of the divs, you call $this.animate(...)   where $this == $('div')
[16:45:48] <min|dvir|us> That might be a mistake.
[16:46:48] <min|dvir|us> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/6/
[16:47:04] <RandalSchwartz> "Just remember... the future is all in one word:  'closures'" :)
[16:47:26] <shoky> ;)
[16:48:22] <RandalSchwartz> closures are frozen snapshots of behavior, ready to be thawed out and served at any time in the future.
[16:48:30] <RandalSchwartz> they're a promise that never spoils. :)
[16:49:08] <min|dvir|us> RandalSchwartz: one day all widespread programming languages will be functional.
[16:49:57] <RandalSchwartz> min|dvir|us I highly dout it
[16:49:59] <RandalSchwartz> doubt
[16:50:03] <itatitat> jumm
[16:50:05] <RandalSchwartz> how would you make the shell "functional"
[16:50:11] <ML74> how can i print only the contents of one div?
[16:50:29] <RandalSchwartz> the shell is always and only imperitive
[16:50:32] <min|dvir|us> RandalSchwartz: I wouldn't consider that a programming language, but you have a fair point.
[16:50:45] <RandalSchwartz> it's a langauge that can be used for automation.
[16:50:51] <RandalSchwartz> therefore, it's a programming language.
[16:50:53] <min|dvir|us> So is English.
[16:51:08] <RandalSchwartz> especially since it has decision and iteration
[16:51:11] <RandalSchwartz> so it's turing complete
[16:51:19] <itatitat> ey guys
[16:51:25] <itatitat> someone saw my code?
[16:51:45] <itatitat> I think the problem has relation with bind and live?
[16:51:50] <itatitat> may be?
[16:51:51] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/6/ why won't the anonymous function run within pulseHeight()?
[16:51:59] <Whirl3d> poor turing

[16:52:26] <min|dvir|us> RandalSchwartz: decision and iteration are sufficient for Turing-completeness?

[16:53:43] <itatitat> ??

[16:53:56] <itatitat> the same???
[16:54:01] <wodemaye_> yeah.
[16:54:05] <wodemaye_> i get this error.
[16:54:09] <mmealling2> holy cow... ton of people here.
[16:54:18] <min|dvir|us> Can you guys indent your code reasonably?
[16:54:20] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, can you help me out with that firebug message?
[16:54:48] <itatitat> jumm
[16:54:49] <itatitat> nono
[16:54:52] <itatitat> muy problem is the next
[16:55:02] <itatitat> because I can change the content
[16:55:42] <itatitat> but my problem is that later, if I want to use some functions of my HTML with the new content (already loaded), this funcitons dont work
[16:55:58] <wodemaye_> itatitat, oh, sorry then.  i'm not sure.
[16:56:04] <itatitat> nono, dont worry
[16:56:08] <min|dvir|us> itatitat: the first step of solving a problem is figuring out exactly what the problem is.
[16:56:08] <wodemaye_> you around, shoky ?
[16:56:23] <Whirl3d> woodemaye_, what is the problem?
[16:56:27] <min|dvir|us> By that I mean, whittle away at code until you have a minimal test case.
[16:56:33] <min|dvir|us> MINIMAL.
[16:56:37] <wodemaye_> missing } after property list | json: getStaticJson() | /d2m3b/57/show/ (line 63, col 18)
[16:56:39] <min|dvir|us> So people will actually want to help you.
[16:56:48] <Whirl3d> try adding a comma just before that line
[16:57:10] <wodemaye_> itatitat, try meld or winmerge to find difference between working and nonworking copies.
[16:57:19] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, last line of what?
[16:57:19] <mmealling2> ok, here's my question (a bit of a newb here so bear with me): I have a <input type="text"> that I'm doing autocomplete on. I have a simple sortable list ("<ul id="sortable></ul>"). I want the autocomplete's "select" to add a formatted version of the result of the autocomplete to be added to the sortable list. (i.e. the user adds items and then sorts them in order of preference).
[16:57:45] <xenaxon> Hi guys. How can I make 2 divs with the same size, be the size of the bigger div ?
[16:57:52] <xenaxon> I mean
[16:58:00] <xenaxon> How can I make 2 divs with the same CLASS!!, be the size of the bigger div ?
[16:58:01] <Whirl3d> woodemaye, you are passing an object literal that looks like this:   delay:1 success:getjason...it should be delay:1, success:get
[16:58:31] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, btw there's only one o in my nick.  do you have tab completion?
[16:58:45] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: var height = max($('#div1').height(), $('#div2').height()); $('#div1').height(height); $('#div2').height(height);
[16:58:52] <Whirl3d> Yeah, but I always forget to use it.
[16:59:01] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, oh, it makes life so much easier.
[16:59:05] <xenaxon> min
[16:59:11] <mmealling2> To add the item to the list I have "var $sortable = $("#sortable"); $sortable.add(randomnodeofhtml);" in the select event of the autocomplete function.
[16:59:21] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: press the type few letters of my name and press tab.
[16:59:26] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, just type one char of someones name and tab.. but are you suggesting that I need more commas?
[16:59:31] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: I don't know the ids. only the class.
[16:59:32] <min|dvir|us> Whoops.
[16:59:37] <wodemaye_> can u just give me an example of where the extra } should go?
[16:59:50] <wodemaye_> s/}/,
[16:59:56] <Whirl3d> wodemaye_, you don't need the exta }
[17:00:17] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, yeah, so where should the extra , go?
[17:00:19] <Whirl3d> your object literal is a set of properties:val separated by a comma and you are missing a ,
[17:00:32] <Whirl3d> the comma, before your success property is missing
[17:00:36] <mmealling2> The sortable starts out empty. Examples I've seen assume it has entries so it does something like $sortable.children().eq(0).clone().text( sourcenode ).appendTo($sortable)
[17:01:11] <Whirl3d> mmealling2, you have to setup a fiddle at jsfiddle.net if you want that kind of help.
[17:01:25] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, doesn't seem like it.
[17:01:37] <Whirl3d> That's the error I am getting
[17:01:43] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: actually. I know what class/id the divs will have
[17:01:49] <wodemaye_> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/585784
[17:02:00] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: but they are generated dinamically, and I have no way of knowing which one to do at a particular time
[17:02:13] <mmealling2> Whirl3d woah.... OK. will have to figure that out first. thanks! (bbiab)
[17:03:16] <xenaxon> I have to set a div inside another div, the difference between the 2 parent divs
[17:03:22] <xenaxon> in height
[17:03:22] <Whirl3d> so, wodemaye_when you fix the first error, then it becomes obvious that your first function is missing a }) at the end of it
[17:03:39] <xenaxon> that way enlarging the smaller one

[17:04:32] <tsavory> .first.column{width:48%;} and .last.column{width:48%; float:right;} is being over written with element.style { float: left; width:50%; }   how would I make this stop happening as I guess the element.style is being written by the jquery script
[17:05:00] <Whirl3d> mmealling2, it's really easy. Just include the html of your file in the top left box (no need for anything but the contents inside the <body> tag. Then your javascript in the lower left, and css in the upper right. Make sure you have jquery selected under framework and then post the link here using the share menu
[17:06:05] <wodemaye_> garrrh!! i'm gonna tear my head out, this seems so simple, and yet I can't get it to work!
[17:06:18] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/59/
[17:06:23] <Whirl3d> no errors there
[17:06:25] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, yeah, i got it. :)
[17:06:33] <wodemaye_> but its still not working like it should...
[17:06:43] <Whirl3d> what is it supposed to do?
[17:06:49] <wodemaye_> try pasting a link - any valid url, in the link box, and then blur out of the link.
[17:06:56] <lolhii> How do I get the ID of this form without hardcoding it? http://jsfiddle.net/s7dfS/1/
[17:07:23] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, from that point on, it should look like http://jsfiddle.net/uGFJF/18/
[17:07:38] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, btw, the two only really differ in the first two lines.
[17:08:31] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, sorry s/two/20.  and of course the bottom functions which are messy looking but not a big deal.
[17:08:31] <Whirl3d> I don['t see the linkbox
[17:08:36] <wodemaye_> they're static.
[17:08:51] <wodemaye_> what do you mean, Whirl3d ?
[17:09:50] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: it's a bit more complicated than that
[17:10:03] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: let me edit jsfiddle to show you what I mean
[17:10:03] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: I'm not going to code your shit for you.
[17:10:20] <xenaxon> no problem, I dont want you to code it
[17:10:26] <Whirl3d> I am looking for a pink box that I can paste a link into (since I colored it pink in css) and don't see it.
[17:10:28] <xenaxon> just tell me a way how to do it
[17:10:42] <wodemaye_> really, Whirl3d ??
[17:10:46] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: I just showed you exactly one way to do it.
[17:10:50] <wodemaye_> link?
[17:11:13] <Whirl3d> Sorry. I see it now. My monitor was being a pain again.
[17:11:25] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: I could have done that with my eyes closed, and typing with my foot's litte finger
[17:11:38] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: thanks, but...
[17:11:44] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: right-o. Sorry for wasting your time.
[17:11:53] <Italian_Plumber> your foot has fingers?
[17:11:54] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: thanks for the help anyway
[17:12:01] <xenaxon> toe, whatever
[17:12:05] <xenaxon> i'm not a native speaker
[17:12:08] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: I'm not sorry at all. You're an asshole. :)
[17:12:12] <Italian_Plumber> I was gonna say ... you might want to get that looked at. :D
[17:12:15] <Whirl3d> try linkbox.val();
[17:12:20] <xenaxon> :))
[17:12:25] <xenaxon> well
[17:12:39] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: well, I thanked you for your time
[17:12:58] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: because you felt bad.
[17:13:00] <min|dvir|us> I'm not stupid.
[17:13:04] <xenaxon> :))
[17:13:05] <xenaxon> ok
[17:13:21] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d,  nope. http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/66/
[17:13:26] <xenaxon> you can interpret it however you like
[17:13:40] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: I interpret it in the way that I no longer want to help you. :)
[17:13:48] <xenaxon> ok
[17:13:54] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/65/
[17:14:02] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/7/ why isn't the callback in pulseHeight getting called?
[17:14:06] <xenaxon> you wern't gonna help me anyway
[17:14:18] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: right, not that I already tried to.
[17:15:13] <wodemaye_> min|dvir|us, xenaxon obviously we're not hearing eachother, so maybe its best to drop it.
[17:15:29] <min|dvir|us> wodemaye_: if you wouldn't have said anything it would have been dropped.
[17:15:44] <wodemaye_> min|dvir|us, perhaps.
[17:15:45] <min|dvir|us> OK 3, 2, 1, DROPPED.
[17:15:53] <wodemaye_> :)
[17:15:53] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/7/ is my problem now. :)
[17:15:55] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: you tried to help, I thanked you for your effort
[17:16:10] <xenaxon> min|dvir|us: what do you want more?
[17:16:15] <min|dvir|us> xenaxon: help.
[17:16:22] <min|dvir|us> I'm here for a reason too.
[17:17:08] <Whirl3d> wodemaye_, you should probably cache your parseJSON results so you don't have reparse the shit for your insterImages func
[17:17:33] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, would that solve the isseue?
[17:18:00] <Whirl3d> no
[17:18:14] <Whirl3d> the other this you should do is check if Other_thumbs exists in your json
[17:18:17] <Whirl3d> it doesnt
[17:18:25] <Whirl3d> it's alternate_thumbs
[17:18:48] <wodemaye_> right, but the main_thumb will still get put into the array regardless and it'll load that into imgs.
[17:23:14] <Whirl3d> Except if it doesn't exist and if you pass an error into a function, you can't expect a result.
[17:23:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/72/
[17:25:02] <ML74> is there any reason why jQuery('#printable .print').html(jQuery('.'+menutag+'').html()); wouldn't work if #printable was set to display:none?
[17:25:40] <shoky> min|dvir|us i haven't been able to solve it yet but the issue is that argsComplete is changed when you do args[1].complete = function() {...
[17:27:08] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, hey, thanks man.
[17:27:10] <johnkpaul> ML74: depends on what you mean by not working
[17:27:22] <johnkpaul> nothing in the UI will change
[17:27:26] <ML74> it doesn't load the content into .print
[17:27:38] <ML74> i'm looking at the source
[17:28:33] <ML74> or will it not show in source?
[17:28:41] <shoky> view source? nope
[17:28:43] <ML74> basically i'm trying to print only the #printable div
[17:28:51] <shoky> view it in firebug/chrome elements view
[17:29:32] <min|dvir|us> shoky: you're saying because it's not a copy?
[17:29:41] <shoky> min|dvir|us something like that, not really sure myself
[17:29:53] <ML74> oh, i see now. it's loading into the div.
[17:29:59] <ML74> it's just not working when i try to print just that div :/
[17:30:04] <min|dvir|us> shoky: how do you know that's the problem?
[17:30:36] <shoky> min|dvir|us cause that makes you lose any reference to the original callback
[17:31:32] <min|dvir|us> shoky: well, I'm assigning it to argsComplete.
[17:31:42] <shoky> i know
[17:31:53] <shoky> but argsComplete changes
[17:31:56] <shoky> just console.log it
[17:33:49] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, forgive me, i'm just diffing these different copies i have flying around now, trying to figure out what you did. :/
[17:34:39] <ML74> i can't seem to get print css to work. i'm getting a blank page every time. content is loaded dynamically though
[17:39:50] <shoky> min|dvir|us sorry i got it wrong.. but something similiar is going on..
[17:39:59] <min|dvir|us> shoky: that's assuring. :(
[17:43:05] <shoky> min|dvir|us i think the problem is that the .slice(0) is a shallow copy
[17:43:32] <shoky> when you change args[1].complete for one div, you're also changing it for the others
[17:44:37] <min|dvir|us> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/JVG6A/9/
[17:45:11] <shoky> yea just tried ;P
[17:51:20] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, it still doesn't do like it should.  any ideas?  i restructured your change a little: http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/74/
[17:53:44] <wodemaye_> I don't understand how parsed_json can be null.
[17:59:47] <shoky> min|dvir|us: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/G5FBt/2/
[18:01:09] <min|dvir|us> shoky: all you did was wrap in a self-invoking anonymous function?
[18:01:11] <shoky> min|dvir|us you were depending on block scope which is non-existent in js
[18:01:28] <shoky> yes and caching 'this' beforehand
[18:01:40] <wodemaye_> shoky, min|dvir|us either of you have any ideas?
[18:02:00] <min|dvir|us> shoky: very interesting.
[18:02:04] <wodemaye_> http://jsfiddle.net/d2m3b/72/ (try pasting a valid URL/link into the input box, after you do it should behave like: http://jsfiddle.net/uGFJF/18/ does.)
[18:04:50] <shoky> wodemaye_ nothing happens in either when i paste a url..
[18:05:16] <wodemaye_> shoky, no, in the reference (/18) you don't need to paste anything.
[18:05:23] <wodemaye_> just click then next/prev buttons.
[18:05:29] <wodemaye_> the red ones.
[18:05:47] <shoky> ok so there are images in one and the other is blank..
[18:05:57] <wodemaye_> but in the broken one (/72) you should paste a URL, then press tab and defocus/blur the textbox.
[18:06:05] <shoky> so it doesnt behave the same even before i paste a link..
[18:06:17] <wodemaye_> after you do so the broken one is *supposed* to be exactly like the working one.
[18:06:43] <wodemaye_> shoky, ya' smell me?
[18:06:45] <shoky> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'first_choice_thumb' of null
[18:07:15] <shoky> imageObj is null
[18:08:25] <mmealling2> OK.... lets try this: http://jsfiddle.net/wTZHp/
[18:08:52] <mmealling2> my autocomplete for that isn't working since its a remote style autocomplete.
[18:09:05] <m0> hey, if I have styles in an obj like {left: 1, top:2}, is there an existing way setting it, or I have to just loop them?
[18:09:20] <shoky> wodemaye_ you're running parseJSON on an object
[18:10:13] <wodemaye_> shoky, and?
[18:10:37] <shoky> ?parseJSON @ wodemaye_
[18:10:37] <bot-t> wodemaye_, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[18:11:05] <shoky> wodemaye_ and so parseJSON returns null
[18:11:23] <wodemaye_> shoky, why?
[18:11:25] <shoky> what's the point of logging to console if you don't take care of the exceptions?
[18:11:33] <shoky> wodemaye_ what do you mean why
[18:11:38] <RavenHursT> Anyone here available to help my w/ a jqueryui.autocomplete() bug?
[18:11:46] <shoky> no
[18:11:56] <RavenHursT> no?
[18:12:01] <shoky> ?ask
[18:12:01] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:12:14] <RavenHursT> well alrighty the..
[18:12:16] <RavenHursT> then
[18:12:23] <wodemaye_> haha
[18:12:29] <mmealling2> the autocomplete works fine. Its the select: that's giving me trouble. I want the selected item in the autocomplete to be appended to the Sortable list. $("#sortable").append('<li>..</li').SortableAddItem(document.getElementById('newitem')      throws Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'SortableAddItem'
[18:13:04] <mmealling2> sort of new to Javascript or I'd call that a type casting problem but I see no casting here.
[18:13:05] <wodemaye_> why does it return null, i mean. is my json not well formed? it passes the linter.
[18:13:27] <shoky> wodemaye_ you're running parseJSON on an object
[18:14:33] <mmealling2> again, that's at http://jsfiddle.net/wTZHp/
[18:14:37] <RavenHursT> So I'm pilling the "source" for my autocomplete from a local sqlite db.. just putting item and tag names into the string array... I'm console.log()'ing the array on the "search" event and I can see that the items are in there.. but for some reason, the autocomplete never fills up the suggestion ul... any help would be appreciated: http://labs.fulltuckracing.com
[18:14:52] <RavenHursT> pulling.. not pilling
[18:15:08] <ML74> can someone help me with a print stylesheet for dynamically loaded content?
[18:15:51] <RavenHursT> http://labs.fulltuckracing.com <-- only tested in Chrome... so not sure if it's going to work in any other browsers since I'm working with mostly webKit functionality..
[18:16:22] <shoky> wodemaye_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/d2m3b/75/
[18:17:26] <RavenHursT> Here's the code for the item/tag input: http://pastebin.com/JbGvmKkG
[18:18:07] <RavenHursT> Autocomplete bits are around line 26
[18:18:37] <shoky> mmealling2: what is .SortableAddItem ?
[18:20:09] <mmealling2> shoky... suposedly a method of Sortable. I see it used in lots of places but can't find the right documentation for it.
[18:20:57] <LekeFly> Anyone that can help me get this code running in a prototype/jquery "enviorment" http://pastebin.com/m40reRRy using noconflict $ = jQuery
[18:21:05] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: .sortableAddItem() is an event fired on a .sortable widget when an li is added to it, isn't it?
[18:21:17] <wodemaye_> oh my shoky (shoky==god.)
[18:21:28] <shoky> oh my
[18:21:38] <shoky> mmealling2: there's your problem then
[18:22:14] <mmealling2> OK. So that method is wrong... so how do you add an item to a Sortable?
[18:22:35] <shoky> why dont you start with reading the RIGHT docs
[18:22:47] <ML74> can someone help me with a print stylesheet for dynamically loaded content?
[18:23:16] <mmealling2> shoky, that's what I'm looking for. (sadly that's an option google doesn't give me. ;-)
[18:23:30] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: I'm doing it at http://labs.fulltuckracing.com by just doing something like $('ul.sortable').append($(newli)); after the sortable has already been initialized
[18:24:10] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: just like you would add an LI to any UL
[18:24:19] <mmealling2> RavenHursT, thanks.... I'll dig into that...
[18:24:25] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: np :-)
[18:25:37] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: Sounds like shoky enjoys complaining that people aren't asking the RIGHT question more than he enjoys actually helping people...  Always wondered why people like that hang around in IRC rooms like this...
[18:25:51] <RavenHursT> glad I could be of SOME help ;-)
[18:26:21] <mmealling2> RavenHursT, well, he's here and he responded so I'm happy with that. Just wish there was some way to identify what was "right".
[18:26:30] <mmealling2> thanks!
[18:26:41] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: hehe.. good attitude! :-)
[18:27:07] <shoky> right cause i never help anybody around here
[18:27:18] <RavenHursT> So.. anyone have any idea what's going on with my autocomplete @ http://labs.fulltuckracing.com
[18:27:21] <RavenHursT> ?
[18:27:50] <shoky> and i was not at all trying to find mmealling2 the best answer while you were bashing me
[18:29:47] <mmealling2> RavenHursT, which .js has your $('lists').autocomplate({}) bits?
[18:30:19] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: sorry.. only the item/tag input is going to have the autocomplete for now..
[18:30:33] <RavenHursT> should have clarified that..
[18:30:53] <xenaxon> how can I get the id of the div with the smallest height in a class
[18:30:56] <xenaxon> ?
[18:31:47] <mmealling2> heh.... sounds like we're trying to do the exact same thing
[18:31:48] <RavenHursT> xenaxon: what do you mean, "in a class"?  like.. the tag class? or a javascript class?
[18:32:06] <xenaxon> html/css class
[18:32:11] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: uh oh.. maybe we're interviewing for the same job.. lol
[18:32:41] <mmealling2> well, then where is $('#item-tag-input').autocomplete({}) ?
[18:32:49] <RavenHursT> xenaxon: loop over the children in the element w/ the class and compair the $(child).height()'s?
[18:32:52] <xenaxon> i have a html/css class that has 2 divs in it, and I want to get the id of the one with the smaller height
[18:33:17] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: http://pastebin.com/JbGvmKkG line 26

[18:33:31] <shoky> oops
[18:33:35] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: itemTagInput.js
[18:33:57] <shoky> xenaxon:  var min;   $('.className').each( function() { if (!min || min.height() > $(this).height()) min = $(this); } )
[18:34:34] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: you find it?
[18:34:47] <mmealling2> not sure... here's my attempt: http://rocketforge.org/topfivelikeme/code/autocomplete.html
[18:35:27] <xenaxon> shoky it says undefined
[18:35:36] <shoky> what does
[18:35:43] <mmealling2> ah, found it.... line 26
[18:35:45] <xenaxon> the var min
[18:36:30] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: cool
[18:36:31] <mmealling2> mine takes movie titles....
[18:37:02] <LekeFly> Anyone that can help me get this code running in a prototype/jquery "enviorment" http://pastebin.com/m40reRRy using noconflict $ = jQuery
[18:37:02] <xenaxon> oh, wait you returned the object
[18:37:07] <xenaxon> i tought you returned the id directly
[18:37:25] <shoky> min[0].id
[18:37:54] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: well.. looks like yours is working.
[18:37:56] <shoky> Hm
[18:37:58] <RavenHursT> ugh
[18:38:36] * tw2113 goes to the start of yayquery podcast
[18:38:46] <lenswipe> http://imagebin.org/209292
[18:38:49] <lenswipe> hhey guys
[18:38:59] <lenswipe> i have something like that for my UI
[18:39:03] <shoky> there's yayquery?
[18:39:04] <shoky> now?
[18:39:05] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: I just don't get it.. I know the "source" option is there and good because I can see the array values in the console as I start typing in the input.. but for some reason it's not populating the autocomplete ul at the bottom of the markup
[18:39:11] <mmealling2> well, the autocomplete is, but the .sortable isn't....
[18:39:12] <tw2113> no new one
[18:39:14] <shoky> ah
[18:39:16] <tw2113> i went to episode 0
[18:39:26] <lenswipe> i want to loop through the rows and then set the height of all the blocks in that row to the height of the highest one
[18:39:33] <lenswipe> how do i go about that
[18:39:37] <lenswipe> lemme paste the code i have so far
[18:39:43] <xenaxon> shoky: thanks. works like a charm
[18:39:47] <shoky> np
[18:40:16] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/STPEX/
[18:40:25] <mmealling2> RavenHursT, well, I can't type into the <input> at all so I can't quite see what's up. And you're using a callback. I'm using a remote datasource. I'll eventually have to move to what you're doing since I have a lot of movie titles to cache.
[18:40:27] <lenswipe> shoky, any ideas?
[18:40:33] <lenswipe> you're usually full of ideas :p
[18:41:09] <shoky> lenswipe as long as youre fiddling why not make it actually show something?
[18:41:18] <shoky> going through code is not fun
[18:41:32] <lenswipe> shoky, i cant
[18:41:36] <shoky> yes you can
[18:41:41] <lenswipe> i would have to post LOADS of HTML and CSS in there
[18:41:44] <shoky> no you wouldnt
[18:41:47] <lenswipe> to make the rows and columns line up
[18:41:48] <shoky> <div></div>
[18:41:51] <shoky> thats not hard
[18:41:54] <lenswipe> twss
[18:41:54] <lenswipe> :p
[18:41:56] <lenswipe> okay
[18:42:05] <mmealling2> Aha! I'm getting close!
[18:42:13] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: I'm using a browser HTML5 db: http://rickosborne.org/blog/2010/03/html5-in-browser-sql-database-storage/
[18:42:51] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: not a callback.. just an array of strings populated by a local browser database call
[18:43:18] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: fillSearchSource in that file
[18:43:30] <mmealling2> ah! yea, I was wondering if something like that existed. This is going into a Facebook app so I can't assume HTML5. But I have several hundred thousand movie titles. So I'm going to have to get smart about how I do caching of that data.
[18:44:10] <wodemaye_> truly, shoky.  you are seriously awesome!
[18:44:15] <wodemaye_> thankkk you!!!!!!!
[18:44:17] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: autocomplete has some kind of caching that I noticed in the docs for it.. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[18:44:18] <wodemaye_> TODA RABAH!
[18:44:32] <shoky> loll np
[18:44:53] <mmealling2> Yep.... I just don't want the javascript to be waiting while I download and parse a fairly large zip file.
[18:45:25] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: ah
[18:45:38] <RavenHursT> mmealling2: ugh.. just wish I could figure this out.. driving me nutz
[18:46:09] <lenswipe> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/STPEX/2/
[18:46:42] <shoky> yea so it's getting the height..
[18:46:52] <shoky> oh you can't set the height like that
[18:46:56] <lenswipe> ....?
[18:46:57] <lenswipe> O_O
[18:47:04] <shoky> .css('height',maxHeight + 'px') or smth
[18:47:46] <shoky> o u can
[18:47:48] <shoky> WtF
[18:48:10] <shoky> nm
[18:48:13] <shoky> lenswipe what's thje prob?
[18:48:22] <lenswipe> they're still the same height
[18:48:24] <RavenHursT> Anyone else have any idea why an autocomplete wouldnt' be populating even though I'm feeding it an array of strings?
[18:48:40] <shoky> lenswipe isn't that the point?
[18:48:42] <lenswipe> shoky, see how its getting the highest one in the document and setting all the others to match?
[18:48:47] <shoky> yes
[18:48:50] <lenswipe> i want to do that but on a row by row basis
[18:49:30] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/STPEX/3/
[18:49:35] <shoky> then do it on a row by row basis: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/STPEX/4/
[18:49:47] <lenswipe> so i want all the blocks in row #1 to be the height of the highest one in row 1
[18:49:49] <lenswipe> etc etc
[18:49:54] <shoky> yea gotcha
[18:49:59] <lenswipe> ty

[19:02:03] <mmealling2> heh
[19:02:06] <lenswipe> i totally shouldnt
[19:05:34] <xenaxon> guys, how can I send a php session variable through JQUERY?
[19:06:08] <shoky> jquery is clientside plx
[19:06:35] <xenaxon> yes, but can I do it with ajax?
[19:06:52] <shoky> your php page can set any session variables it likes
[19:07:30] <shoky> ajax = request a php page, maybe with some parameters
[19:07:41] <xenaxon> does jquery have any function to simplify this
[19:07:41] <xenaxon> ?
[19:07:48] <xenaxon> jquery ajax I mean.
[19:08:28] <shoky> $.get ? $.posdt ?
[19:08:29] <shoky> post
[19:08:49] <xenaxon> yes
[19:08:53] <xenaxon> ok
[19:16:20] <RavenHursT> ok.. wtf?  why is the autocomplete now showing up at the top of the darn page?? http://labs.fulltuckracing.com/
[19:20:41] <RavenHursT> Does anyone know if autocomplete() is using $.offset() to find it's positioning and if so, any idea why an input may not provide that to autocomplete correctly to cause it to just show up at 0px, 0px on the page?
[19:27:45] <xmaddness> So are there any canvas jquery plugins yet?
[19:28:04] <xmaddness> nevermind
[19:31:59] <RavenHursT> Answer to my above question^ : Needed to include the "position" jqueryUI component in my script calls.. it's all working now!
[19:32:01] <RavenHursT> :-)
[19:32:20] <slackware> So guys you see, I have this main.php webpage which gets info through ajax from somefile.php
[19:32:31] <slackware> It takes that info and puts it on the webpage main.php
[19:33:05] <slackware> And in my jquery, I have an event handler going like so: $('.someDivFromsomefile').click(function(){
[19:33:12] <slackware> But it does not work! Why?
[19:33:39] <slackware> Is it because the element wasnt added on pageload?
[19:34:01] <shoky> yes
[19:34:22] <slackware> how do I fix this?
[19:34:42] <shoky> either bind the event AFTER adding the content to the dom, or delegate the event to a container element
[19:34:49] <shoky> for the latter, see ?on
[19:34:49] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:35:10] <slackware> I will try bind
[19:35:20] <slackware> but wait....
[19:35:25] <slackware> How does it work??
[19:35:34] <slackware> Do I do it after the .done?
[19:35:43] <shoky> inside the callback
[19:35:49] <slackware> I bind the event
[19:35:53] <slackware> in the callback
[19:35:54] <shoky> yes
[19:36:08] <slackware> And in another place on the file I assign the function to this event
[19:36:35] <shoky> what
[19:36:47] <slackware> .done(function(){ $('someClas').bind('ckick');
[19:36:48] <slackware> ??
[19:36:56] <slackware> .done(function(){ $('someClas').bind('click'); }
[19:37:00] <shoky> yes. you can leave it with .click(..)
[19:37:10] <shoky> (instead of .bind)
[19:37:18] <slackware> you just said I need ot bind...
[19:37:20] <slackware> to*
[19:37:26] <shoky> yes, .click binds
[19:37:33] <shoky> .click would do the same as .on('click'
[19:37:35] <shoky> er
[19:37:40] <shoky> the same as .bind('click'
[19:37:47] <slackware> ....
[19:37:52] <shoky> the emphasis was on WHEN to bind
[19:37:53] <shoky> not how
[19:37:56] <slackware> So I do .click or .bind('click')?
[19:37:59] <shoky> either is fine
[19:38:07] <slackware> ...
[19:38:14] <slackware> ok one sec..
[19:38:27] <shoky> but
[19:38:50] <shoky> its more like: .done(function(data){ ... add data to DOM ....;  $('someClas').bind('click'); }
[19:39:07] <slackware> thats what I did...
[19:39:09] <shoky> ok
[19:39:14] <slackware> And it does not work..
[19:39:21] <slackware> OH
[19:39:22] <slackware> WAIT
[19:39:29] <slackware> That is exactly what i SAID...
[19:39:34] <shoky> ?
[19:39:42] <slackware> goddamit
[19:39:45] <slackware> let me send you a gist
[19:41:57] <shoky> too slow
[19:42:00] <shoky> me go sleepy
[19:42:01] <shoky> byby
[19:42:11] <slackware> wait
[19:42:12] <slackware> wait
[19:42:13] <slackware> cmon
[19:42:16] <slackware> ONE SECOND D:
[19:42:17] <shoky> ..
[19:42:27] <slackware> https://gist.github.com/2468448
[19:42:38] <slackware> WHOOPs
[19:42:48] <shoky> ???
[19:42:50] <slackware> ok
[19:42:51] <slackware> https://gist.github.com/2468448
[19:42:54] <slackware> go again
[19:43:07] <slackware> there will be nothing added to the console..
[19:43:18] <shoky> but youre not adding anything with class 'ad' to the dom ..
[19:43:27] <shoky> and what is .bind
[19:43:30] <slackware> I just edited the gist
[19:43:32] <shoky> and what is .bind('click') supposed to do??
[19:43:40] <shoky> RTFM
[19:43:42] <slackware> Well, that's what I was asking to you..
[19:43:44] <slackware> DYDE!?
[19:43:45] <slackware> DUDE!?
[19:43:47] <shoky> ?
[19:43:54] <slackware> thats what you told me to do!
[19:44:06] <shoky> no its not
[19:44:09] <slackware> the click event is not activating on a dinamically added content!
[19:44:49] <slackware> WOOHOO
[19:44:56] <slackware> Ok I figured it out
[19:45:00] <beancurd> huh.
[19:45:15] <slackware> it goes like so: $('.someclass').live('click', function(){ ... }
[19:45:22] <shoky> slackware: https://gist.github.com/2468461  is what i meant
[19:45:36] <shoky> night.
[19:45:52] <slackware> night
[19:50:45] <batdorf> id like to somehow count the objects that I create using each() and be able to reference them from within the plugin i'm "making"
[19:52:47] <batdorf> I am editing a plugin that the user can use on multiple page elements. However, I would like to be able to count how many of those elements they created (hope this makes more sense)
[20:09:44] <joobie> hey guys.. is there a decent jquery module that can display a table of data in an editable form? like a standard decent module to use for this? i'm seeing quite a few in google, not sure which to go with
[20:11:45] <runvnc> what exactly do you mean table of data in editable form
[20:12:04] <runvnc> one that is not based on jquery but is popular is slickgrid
[20:12:25] <runvnc> or maybe you really want a wysiwyg editor with table editing capability like aloha editor
[20:12:31] <runvnc> jqgrid works also
[20:14:56] <jcp_> how can i get the fixed element to stop before it overlaps the footer? http://jsfiddle.net/9QRER/1/
[20:15:33] <joobie> runvnc, slickgrid looks perfect - but maybe with paging functionality
[20:16:11] <tsavory> just change it from style="foo" to class="bar" (and then add the foo stuff to a bar rule in your CSS) what does this mean in reference to $inBox.append($("<div class='" + className + "' style='width:" + (Math.floor(100 / numCols))+ "%; float: " + options.columnFloat + ";'></div>")); I am getting element.style over writing my .first.column and .last.column when rendering
[20:17:44] <runvnc> you want to add paging to slickgrid? Are you sure you understand the concept of slickgrid I mean the whole point of the thing is sort of infinite scrolling rows which is not compatible with paging
[20:19:18] <runvnc> what about just making the zindex higher for the footer so it goes over scroll
[20:19:50] <runvnc> well not infinite rows but
[20:19:52] <joobie> runvnc,
[20:19:54] <joobie> scratch the above
[20:19:57] <joobie> jqgrid looks perfect.
[20:20:00] <joobie> thank you sir :P
[20:20:06] <runvnc> np
[20:20:18] <jcp_> runvnc: ya, but that feels like it's avoiding a better solution, which would be to stop it before it hits the footer
[20:21:34] <runvnc> Maybe there is an event when the scroll position changes and then you could change the height of scroll
[20:59:26] <lorph> how do I hook posts so I can automatically add csrf? I think there's a better solution than this http://www.privatepaste.com/954d42433d
[21:17:54] <spoonybard> http://jsfiddle.net/RqBLx/1/ is a filter the right way to select specific tags from a table with an each()?
[21:18:01] <spoonybard> i.e more than one tag
[21:20:03] <jcp_> you could use find()
[21:21:36] <spoonybard> that sounds like a good idea thnx
[21:22:34] <spoonybard> but can jquery support more than one tag in the brackets? that would shorten my code by a lot
[21:22:40] <spoonybard> but does*
[21:24:30] <spoonybard> $('td.matrix, div a')  something like that
[21:24:34] <xenaxon> how can I make jquery do something after 30 seconds of inactivity
[21:24:35] <xenaxon> ?
[21:25:05] <jcp_> spoonybard: yea
[21:25:38] <beancurd> spoonybard: api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[21:26:02] <jcp_> xenaxon: you could use delay or setTimeout()
[21:28:28] <spoonybard> http://pastebin.com/HAJYseFz why would this only output/store data for the first selector?
[21:35:26] <jwg2s> hey all, anyone awake?
[21:35:55] <jwg2s> anyone know of a good way to add an outer glow on an png with transparency on hover?
[21:50:00] <vl1234> hi gud morning
[21:51:27] <vl1234> i need 1 help from u guys........i get the all element by using the each function and store it one variable ........but i need is how to remove that hole array list
[21:52:50] <Whirl3d> v1234, why do you need .each to get a collection of elements?
[21:53:32] <Whirl3d> jqg2s, if you plan to use css3 transforms, there's a simple way to do it without jquery. If you want to use jquery, then there are two easy ways to handle it.
[21:58:33] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to figure out how to pass a value with a "button" using Jquery.   Am I on track with this being the button code?   <button id="14">Delete</button>
[21:59:07] <coldhead> that button doesn't seem to have a value
[21:59:08] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to setup an ajax.  I need to know that value to know which record the user wants to delete
[21:59:13] <Whirl3d> RonWhoCares, are you familiar with html
[21:59:13] <coldhead> but its otherwise reasonable
[21:59:28] <vl1234> @whirl3d.......then how to remove that 1
[21:59:30] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: Yes I am.  Do I need to have a "Value" field
[21:59:59] <vl1234> @whirl3d.......am created that array in dynamic way only
[22:00:04] <Whirl3d> RonWhoCares, there are a number of ways to associate a value with a button element.
[22:00:17] <coldhead> what's your favourite, Whirl3d?
[22:00:38] <Whirl3d> I prefer not to use button elements, so I had to look it up.
[22:00:48] <Whirl3d> but adding the value attribute seems to work.
[22:01:35] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: Is this correct:   <button id="cron_job_report_reference" value="15">Delete</button>
[22:01:35] <coldhead> <button id="14" value="gypsies">Delete</button>
[22:01:51] <coldhead> that's a much better id, RonWhoCares
[22:02:02] <RonWhoCares> 14 is the value I need to pass coldhead
[22:02:33] <Whirl3d> don't pass it to coldhead unless you want it right back. He's good at giving you back what you give him.
[22:02:52] <Whirl3d> oh, sorry, you meant pass in general...lol
[22:03:36] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:03:44] <coldhead> so $('#cron_job_report_reference').val()
[22:03:53] <coldhead> should give you 14
[22:04:02] <Whirl3d> vl1234, I think you are going to have to generate a jsfiddle with your code to get help.
[22:04:19] <coldhead> vl1234: you better do what Whirl3d says
[22:05:08] <RonWhoCares> How does the Script need to look like with the button code I just posted?  This is what I have so far:
[22:05:10] <RonWhoCares> http://pastebin.com/mhhMBwJU
[22:05:18] <Whirl3d> just so we are all clear here, coldhead not only is one of the best jquery experts in this channel, he's also one of the greatest sources of entertainment and a big part of why this cannel remains light and enjoyable.
[22:06:38] <Whirl3d> RonWhoCares, you can use the relative identifier $(this) inside your click handler...$("someElement").click(function () {$(this) ---refers to $("someElement")
[22:08:11] <RonWhoCares> Coldhead I am not sure how to apply what you have said
[22:08:43] <RonWhoCares> do I just change line 3
[22:09:07] <vl1234> @whirl3d...................var a= [ ["20","30"],["10","40"],["40","20"]] i have like that array now i have to delete a[1] permanently .............how to do?????///
[22:09:12] <coldhead> Whirl3d: i am flattered, thank you
[22:09:27] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: what you have already looks like it should work
[22:09:36] <coldhead> BUT under the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself
[22:09:42] <coldhead> you should just use $(this) inside the click
[22:09:47] <coldhead> rather than repeating the ID
[22:10:03] <coldhead> it also saves on typing
[22:10:43] <Whirl3d> vt1234, that's a javascript thing. It's not jQuery specific. Still, to remove an element from an array of elements in javascript, look up "javascript slice"
[22:11:03] <RonWhoCares> what alert statement would I need to see if I have the value passed
[22:11:42] <Whirl3d> vl1234, you should also study up on javascript's Array.splice method
[22:12:50] <Whirl3d> so, you would remove a[1] in your example by using a=a.splice(1);
[22:12:53] <Dr-Bombay> welcome to splitsville, population: you
[22:14:38] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: http://pastebin.com/SgNchtuH
[22:15:54] <RonWhoCares> coldhead: I got it work only once
[22:16:03] <RonWhoCares> using the code I showed you
[22:16:16] <coldhead> it should work a bunch of times
[22:16:21] <coldhead> ?demo @ RonWhoCares
[22:16:22] <bot-t> RonWhoCares, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:17:50] <RonWhoCares> give me a minute
[22:18:03] <coldhead> take as long as you need <3
[22:18:34] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: is the "data" that is being returned a replacement for the old button?
[22:18:46] <RonWhoCares> correct
[22:19:04] <RonWhoCares> but the button doesn't work when it is clicked
[22:19:25] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: http://pastebin.com/mX0UpJHe
[22:19:39] <coldhead> you need to replace the .click( with .on('click',
[22:19:50] <coldhead> which works for all existing and future elements with that ID
[22:19:56] <coldhead> .click just binds to an existing one
[22:20:03] <coldhead> and when you replace it, jquery doesn't know about it
[22:22:26] <RonWhoCares> coldhead: your code also only worked once
[22:22:48] <coldhead> it works more than once in my imagination!
[22:23:01] <coldhead> does the replacement button have EXACTLY THE SAME ID?
[22:25:15] <RonWhoCares> yes
[22:25:36] <coldhead> it really should work then
[22:25:55] <coldhead> got a link?
[22:26:00] <RonWhoCares> The button is created in a function, with this line of code: echo "<button id=\"cron_job_report_reference\" value=\"" . $report_reference . "\">Delete</button>\r\n";
[22:27:09] <RonWhoCares> give me a minute
[22:36:38] <Whirl3d> can I use $.extend to extend the Array prototype?  var myCustomArrayLikeObject=$.extend(true, {}, Array.prototype);
[22:37:18] <Whirl3d> or do I just use var myCustomArray=[]; then myCustomArray.prototype...
[22:37:23] <Whirl3d> duh...never mind
[22:51:43] <Dr-Bombay> vl: please refere to documentation for Array.splice http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wctc5k7s(v=vs.94).aspx
[22:51:48] <Dr-Bombay> shit
[22:51:49] <Whirl3d> why is it that people who use jQuery are so opposed to using javascript objects? So many of my problems lately have been easily solved by creating a javascript object to handle my data and storing that object in the data object for an element. But I get the feeling that is frowned upon.
[22:51:53] <Dr-Bombay> never mind vl
[22:51:56] <Dr-Bombay> my scroll was stuck
[22:52:55] <coldhead> seriously, RonWhoCares, it was OUR FUCKING PLEASURE to serve you
[22:53:07] <coldhead> may all your bugs only appear in production
[22:53:15] <Dr-Bombay> whirl3d: I don't know what you're talking about but there are probably many programmers who "discovered" javascript as a practical programming langauge through jQuery and are just not familiar with its other features
[22:53:53] <Dr-Bombay> (yet)
[22:54:02] <Whirl3d> Oh, that would be me for sure. So , I guess maybe it's just that they KNOW jquery, but don't know javascript that well.
[22:54:07] <coldhead> i'm not aware of a bias against objects, Whirl3d
[22:54:22] <Whirl3d> Cool. Good to know.
[22:54:26] <coldhead> object literals are pretty idiomatic
[22:54:28] <systemfault> It's not like jquery can replace javascript..
[22:54:36] <systemfault> (Since it's javascript)
[22:54:47] <coldhead> $('<a />', {href: 'whatever'}) etc
[22:55:19] <Whirl3d> I struggled forever to create custom methods on elements that I could easily access. I used .bind and trigger, custom event handlers, etc. When all of it could be easily handled by a logic object that referenced the element in question.
[22:55:56] <Whirl3d> perhaps it's just not knowing the right questions to ask.
[22:56:09] <tianxx> when i use ajaxSubmit upload file,success function callback fails in IE,but chrome works
[22:56:36] <Whirl3d> tianxx, are you asking why IE sux?
[22:56:58] <tw2113> Whirl3d why is the sky blue?
[22:57:50] <systemfault> The only IE that really really sucked is 7 :/
[22:58:02] <Whirl3d> The others only kinda sucked.
[22:58:09] <Whirl3d> *suck
[22:58:12] <systemfault> Because it's the only one they willingly made suck
[22:58:15] <tw2113> IE6 did progressively once it plateau'd
[22:58:25] <Cork> tianxx: ie < 10 doesn't support the file api so you can't upload files over ajax
[22:58:31] <systemfault> IE6 was wonderful when it came out 11 years ago.
[22:58:37] <Cork> (donno if ie10 supports it)
[22:58:40] <tw2113> thus why i said progressively
[22:58:51] <systemfault> tw2113: True
[22:58:52] <coldhead> ie6 did 9/11
[22:58:59] <Whirl3d> 11 years ago? holy moses it has been a long time
[22:59:08] <systemfault> coldhead: Well… the web dev's 9/11
[22:59:31] <Cork> systemfault: no ie6 was never wonderfull
[22:59:42] <tw2113> i barely bother with IE7 nowadays, so IE6 is a fuck no
[22:59:44] <Cork> it was stagnated and almost nothing had been fixed since ie4.5
[23:00:02] <systemfault> Cork: We had nothing else… stagnation or not.
[23:00:04] <Whirl3d> I stopped using it back when Flock came out...
[23:00:07] <systemfault> Cork: Until firefox.
[23:00:12] <Cork> true
[23:00:13] <Whirl3d> Flock, rip
[23:01:03] <systemfault> The day IE7 was released, it already sucked.
[23:01:13] <systemfault> IE8 is a fine CSS2 browser...
[23:01:58] <systemfault> (A half-finished browser that was shipped with a half-finished Windows)
[23:02:03] <systemfault> …. Vista
[23:02:37] <Whirl3d> is it my imagination or is Windows 8 just windows 311 interface for windows 7 (with touch)
[23:02:47] <Dr-Bombay> it's your imagination
[23:02:54] <Whirl3d> I have it running on a couple of machines here and it is pathetic
[23:02:58] * tw2113 wants to know what Whirl3d is taking to see that
[23:03:16] <systemfault> Windows 8 is a fine touch device OS IMHO.
[23:03:30] <systemfault> Way nicer than iOS or even Android
[23:03:41] <Whirl3d> I'm running it on desktops as well as a couple of touch devices
[23:03:48] <systemfault> Not sure I'd like it for a workstation though...
[23:04:00] <Dr-Bombay> although since Javascript is single threaded and kills the UI if it has to do any lengthy computation, I suppose you could compare it to Windows 3.1
[23:04:26] <Whirl3d> But on a workstation, its kinda funny. Everyone I know just runs WinStep to return the start menu...then it's just windows 7
[23:04:45] <systemfault> Heh….
[23:07:33] <Whirl3d> I'm holding out for jqueryOS
[23:08:11] <Whirl3d> or $OS which is precariously similar to SOS
[23:08:18] <Whirl3d> 8)
[23:09:03] <Dr-Bombay> you know eventually someone's going to create a web browser coded entirely in javscript and displaying in a canvas, right?
[23:09:16] <chousho> that's not been done yet?
[23:09:17] <Dr-Bombay> the parts are already coming together
[23:10:06] <Dr-Bombay> if it has, I haven't found it
[23:10:36] <Whirl3d> ? eval 5%4
[23:10:38] <bot-t> Whirl3d: 1
[23:11:08] <thinkerbell> Anything wrong with this line of code: var source = this.attr("src");
[23:11:53] <Whirl3d> ? eval 5++%=4
[23:11:54] <bot-t> Whirl3d: SyntaxError: invalid increment operand
[23:12:13] <coldhead> $(this).attr('src') perhaps?
[23:12:18] <coldhead> or this.src ?
[23:13:16] <Cork> this.src isn't the same as attr() :)
[23:13:25] <Cork> it would be $(this).prop('src')
[23:13:30] <thinkerbell> this.src works, but I wonder what I did wrong with the jquery syntax
[23:13:42] <Cork> thinkerbell: this is the dom element
[23:13:47] <Dr-Bombay> this is not a query object. $(this) is
[23:13:49] <Cork> you need the wrapper
[23:13:54] <coldhead> Cork: i've never used prop() in my life
[23:14:06] <coldhead> the difference between attr and prop give me the heebies
[23:14:06] <Monkeypaws> hi quick question, im havin trouble getting the input data from a form checkbox - i thought this would work but no dice - http://pastebin.com/seEAybdu
[23:14:08] <Cork> coldhead: this.src is a property on the dom element
[23:14:33] <Cork> coldhead: attr grabs the attribute (what the web designer added in the src attribute)
[23:14:39] <coldhead> var this = {src: "no it isn't"}
[23:14:46] <Cork> coldhead: property is always the complete url
[23:15:07] <coldhead> yeah this is what i'm talking about, i don't want to have to remember details like that
[23:15:12] <coldhead> its terrifying
[23:15:14] <thinkerbell> this is an image object, and I wanted to get the src attribute of it
[23:15:53] <Cork> coldhead: <img src="file.png"> this.src/$(this).prop('src') == 'http://example.com/file.png', $(this).attr('src') == 'file.png'
[23:16:30] <coldhead> ugh
[23:16:59] <coldhead> that's good data, thanks Cork
[23:17:11] <coldhead> i hope i never have to know the difference
[23:17:14] <thinkerbell> yeah, this property and attribute thing confused me a sec, good explanation Cork
[23:17:18] <Cork> thats why the prop command was split out from attr
[23:17:33] <thinkerbell> But what is wrong with "this.attr('src');"?
[23:17:43] <Whirl3d> this is not a jquery object
[23:17:45] <Cork> thinkerbell: this is the dom element
[23:17:52] <Whirl3d> $(this) is  (as systemfault said)
[23:18:07] <systemfault> I said something? :(
[23:18:12] <Cork> thinkerbell: the attr command is on the jquery object, and you need to wrap the dom element in jquery to access it
[23:18:12] <thinkerbell> this.src works
[23:18:18] <Whirl3d> I thought it wask you...
[23:18:20] <Whirl3d> was
[23:18:25] <thinkerbell> I don't get it
[23:18:40] <Whirl3d> the img dom element has an attribute: src
[23:18:54] <Whirl3d> the img dom element does not have a function .attr("src');
[23:19:00] <Cork> and it has property id, src, width, height....
[23:19:12] <Whirl3d> to get access to the .attr() method, you need a jquery object
[23:19:31] <thinkerbell> this.prop('src'); doesn't seem to work either
[23:19:33] <Cork> and that you get by passing the dom elenent to jqeury ( $() )
[23:19:39] <Whirl3d> img doesn't have prop
[23:19:41] <Whirl3d> as a method
[23:19:44] <coldhead> you wrap the `this` in $() goodness and then you can use prop()/attr()
[23:19:46] <Cork> thinkerbell: this is the dom element
[23:19:51] <coldhead> because the $() fairy gives you them
[23:20:09] <thinkerbell> Cork: explain please
[23:20:24] <Cork> uh... are you trolling?
[23:20:26] <thinkerbell> Oh I get it
[23:20:37] * tw2113 hands out prizes
[23:20:45] <thinkerbell> you gott do $(this).attr('src');
[23:21:13] * Whirl3d continues to clap hoping thinkerbell will get it with enough audience participation
[23:21:41] * tw2113 makes coldhead clap
[23:21:49] * coldhead cries
[23:21:53] <systemfault> Attributes vs properties can be confusing at first :P
[23:22:02] <systemfault> And it's not even a jquery "problem"
[23:22:06] <Whirl3d> and later as it turns out
[23:22:10] <thinkerbell> You guys could've answered, $(this).attr('src');, I know someone said "you gotta wrap it...", it just took longer to click in my head that way.  Thanks guys
[23:22:28] <thinkerbell> I should've known to wrap it in the first place by now
[23:22:33] <Cork> thinkerbell: we've said use $(this) several times
[23:22:35] <tw2113> but you learned
[23:22:47] <tw2113> learning is FUNdamental
[23:22:48] <Cork> thinkerbell: followed by an explonation to why
[23:22:49] <Whirl3d> [02:12] <coldhead> $(this).attr('src') perhaps?
[23:23:37] <thinkerbell> yeah, true, I just noticed the single quotes instead of the double and didn't notice it was wrapped
[23:24:23] <coldhead> great job everyone, take fiev
[23:24:26] <coldhead> five*
[23:24:31] <chousho> ^5
[23:25:23] * tw2113 takes $5 from Whirl3d 
[23:25:45] <tw2113> :D
[23:25:55] <Hopsy> five for?
[23:25:59] * Whirl3d reminds tw2113 that he is going to make Whirled one of the popular kids for that 5$.
[23:26:28] <tw2113> i thought you already were popular in hre
[23:26:29] <tw2113> here*
[23:26:34] <Hopsy> ow, I am getting highlighted when coldhead is talking
[23:27:04] <coldhead> Hcoldpsy?
[23:27:28] <coldhead> five minute break, Hopsy
[23:27:31] <coldhead> time for cigarettes
[23:28:19] <Hopsy> Soo
[23:28:37] <Hopsy> I must go now
[23:29:21] <Hopsy> I wasnt sure about my schedule
[23:30:20] <coldhead> so long Hopsy !
[23:30:25] <coldhead> enjoy your schedule!
[23:31:08] <Whirl3d> terribly off topic, but have you all heard Azealia Banks 212? I know it's probably so "5 minutes ago", but it rocks.
[23:32:57] <coldhead> i am investigating this right now, Whirl3d
[23:33:28] <Whirl3d> what the youtube video. She is hilarious, talented, amazing..
[23:37:06] <coldhead> there is a very very mild suggestiveness of something possibly sexual
[23:37:49] <Whirl3d> is there a faster way to select the single element from an array of elements with property=someval. I am using $.map(elementList, function (elem, i) {return elem[property]==someval?elem:nulll})
[23:38:32] <coldhead> i don't know of a faster way
[23:38:41] <Whirl3d> and something possibly violent...too
[23:39:05] <Whirl3d> though, mildly sexual and violent...not entirely unenjoyable.
[23:40:40] <Whirl3d> Okay, another silly question: when you have a list of indexed elements that you want to keep track of, do you keep them in an array and run a function that returns the indexed element or do you keep them in an object literal and run a function that returns them as an array?
[23:41:02] <Monkeypaws> can someone tell me how to get the results of a checkbox - whether its checked or not?  http://pastebin.com/seEAybdu
[23:41:29] <Whirl3d> in other words: sections["a"]=object, sections['b']=object;    or sections=[{a:object, b:object}];
[23:42:58] <coldhead> Whirl3d: the first one looks more correct tome, just because the second one is an array with one element for some reason
[23:43:22] <coldhead> the fact i'd have to keep using sections[0]  is weird
[23:43:29] <Whirl3d> Sorry. I meant [{a:object}, {b:object}];
[23:43:55] * Monkeypaws sends out an SOS ... --- ...
[23:44:26] <coldhead> Whirl3d: obviously fast lookups by unique queue is preferable
[23:44:31] <thinkerbell> $(this).attr('alt'); is returning undefined, but I am expecting a string
[23:44:37] <coldhead> having to iterate yourself to look for something is gross
[23:45:15] <Whirl3d> but then next and previous (and lookup by index number) all require the same effort in reverse for the object literal
[23:45:36] <coldhead> Monkeypaws: i think you just want $(this).is(':checked')
[23:45:46] <coldhead> rather than $('whatever', this)
[23:46:00] <coldhead> unless this is a form and you're inspecting something within it
[23:46:00] <tianxx>          /away
[23:46:20] <coldhead> Whirl3d: if they're ordered then yes, the array way
[23:46:35] <Whirl3d> I think I am going to use sections object with sections.list=[ordered array]
[23:47:08] <Monkeypaws> thanks coldhead
[23:51:37] <thinkerbell> is the following possible: $(this).attr('alt');
[23:52:02] <thinkerbell> its works for source, but when I try alt, I get undefined
[23:57:57] <coldhead> thinkerbell: what you have should owkr
[23:58:00] <coldhead> work
[23:58:08] <coldhead> provided you have alt="whatever" in your htmls
[23:58:09] <systemfault> Indeed.
[23:58:23] <coldhead> try inspecting the element with firebug/web inspector and see what's actually in the page
