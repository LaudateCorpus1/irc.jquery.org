[04:05:08] <Crash1hd> Can anyone advise what I am doing wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/594275/ <-- if you look at the source code if the value has a space it does not show it right?
[04:09:36] <Woet> Crash1hd: <option value=foo bar>foo bar</option>
[04:09:40] <Woet> Crash1hd: does that look like valid HTML to you?
[04:09:53] <Crash1hd> no
[04:10:01] <Crash1hd> Oh crap I am missing the " lol

[04:34:37] <Woet> diverdude: what is your jQuery question?

[09:30:06] <how2hack> hi, i've got some elements hidden (translateX), the problem is when i tab the page, if there are inputs on this hidden element, the browser does an horizontal scroll to show them, completely breaking the page
[09:31:25] <how2hack> how can i prevent this?
[10:23:01] <diverdude> Hi, i have an element x with a class list. I know there is a class in the classlist which is prefixed with "dir-". How do i extract this class?
[11:27:05] <sine0> jQuery('#pg_length').append(option);
[11:27:47] <sine0> ok so instead of append can I replace what is in there ? I am switching around <select><option> lists but with append it just adds another list of options onto it.
[11:29:21] <sine0> ok so i did an .empty() outside of hte loop
[14:49:26] <sine0> anyone around or just me being a sad git
[14:50:16] <sine0> im trying to work out what would be the best method to do a staged form where each section is unlocked when the correct selection has been made on the stage before

[18:57:24] <dobbler31> Out of the blue, my Google Distance Matrix ajax call is pending for an average of 40 seconds.. I was using file_get_contents() but switched to cURL, now it's not timing out but it's still taking around 40 seconds.. Not even sure if this is the right channel but if anyone can shed some light.. Thanks
[18:58:33] <dobbler31> It's working fine on my local server and when I hit the api url directly. Only has a problem on the production server so the service is working and all quotas etc. are good (unlimited pay as you go account).
