[00:04:04] <Jani_H> timcoal:  I updated the fiddle to maybe show it a little better.  I really like the datalist aspect where typing automatically filters the list for you - https://jsfiddle.net/q354797e/5/
[00:24:56] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  Are you still around - https://jsfiddle.net/q354797e/6/
[00:25:12] <Jani_H> I've added the program writing the content to the text field.
[00:25:29] <Jani_H> although am not sure why var.slice doesn't seem to do what I expect
[00:25:45] <TimCoal> yea had some go slow issues to deal with
[01:53:03] <cpt-oblivious> I am loading an apache index with links into a html page with: $('#links').load("../files/uploads/ a");
[01:53:13] <cpt-oblivious> but it unfortunately strips out the uploads part of all the links
[01:53:29] <cpt-oblivious> how do I get it to leave the links it loads into #links as is, since they're absolute links.
[01:53:41] <Cork> cpt-oblivious: if you load a full page you can't really do it like that
[01:53:50] <Cork> it will only load the body part of the resource
[01:54:03] <cpt-oblivious> well apache generaties an index with a dynamic amount of links
[01:54:07] <cpt-oblivious> and I want to embed those in an html page
[01:54:24] <cpt-oblivious> which is why I am using the .load, but it's screwing up the paths
[01:54:38] <Cork> ya, cause the resource isn't meant to be used like that
[01:54:41] <cpt-oblivious> how should I do that otherwise then Cork ?
[01:54:47] <Cork> apache uses relative urls as far as i remember
[01:55:02] <Cork> cpt-oblivious: best is to use php to generate the data you need client side
[01:55:07] <cpt-oblivious> the auto generated index has absolute paths, https://domain/path/to/files.jpg
[01:55:33] <Cork> cpt-oblivious: check what is in the html
[01:55:39] <cpt-oblivious> it's that
[01:55:55] <cpt-oblivious> but in my loaded stuff it's like: https://domain/path/files.jpg
[01:56:02] <cpt-oblivious> like it strips out 'to' for no reason
[01:56:09] <Cork> it doesn't
[01:56:12] <cpt-oblivious> where the load is occuring at /path/
[01:56:16] <Cork> it is cause it is relative
[01:56:30] <cpt-oblivious> how can I force it to be absolute then?
[01:56:37] <cpt-oblivious> it needs to stop messing up my urls :p
[01:56:40] <Cork> no
[01:56:49] <Cork> you would have to loop every link with js and modify them
[01:57:02] <Cork> or better yet generate a resource server side meant for this use
[01:57:15] <cpt-oblivious> I rather do it clientside than have to run something serverside
[01:57:21] <cpt-oblivious> since I run nothing serverside atm except apache
[01:57:41] <cpt-oblivious> so I have to iterate on all the links and via regex add the missing part of the url before loading it into the div?
[01:57:44] <Cork> well check the apache config, might have something
[01:57:54] <Cork> cpt-oblivious: yes
[01:57:57] <cpt-oblivious> apache is already giving me proper links, it's the html load that screws it up
[01:58:03] <Cork> ...
[01:58:10] <cpt-oblivious> what could I possible do with the apache links?
[01:58:11] <Cork> and the html is generated by apache >_<'
[01:58:18] <cpt-oblivious> no the html is generated by jquery
[01:58:24] <Cork> no
[01:58:34] <Cork> how on earth did you get that idea?
[01:58:47] <cpt-oblivious> like if I navigate to https://domain/path/to/ I get an index.html page with all files in that directory, which is generated by apache.
[01:59:17] <cpt-oblivious> then I have a website under https://domain/path/index.html that loads all links inside /path/to/ into the path/index.html
[01:59:20] <Cork> cpt-oblivious: jquery just fetches the full html page, strips out everything except the body part
[01:59:26] <Cork> and injects that into the page
[01:59:30] <cpt-oblivious> those links, that are perfectly generated by apache as absolute links, then get mangled by the jquery load
[01:59:30] <Cork> every thing else is apache
[01:59:41] <cpt-oblivious> no
[01:59:41] <Cork> no, it is apache that is generating relative links
[01:59:42] <Cork> not jquery
[01:59:45] <cpt-oblivious> that makes no sense
[01:59:53] <Cork> ok, provide a link and i will prove it
[01:59:56] <cpt-oblivious> if I go to the page directly that apache generates it are all absolute links
[02:00:17] <cpt-oblivious> can't easily link it, would have to censor tons of stuff.
[02:00:27] <Cork> no it doesn't
[02:00:36] <cpt-oblivious> but how does that make any sense? like the apache page is generated with absolute links
[02:01:01] <cpt-oblivious> so full 'https://domain/path/to/file.jpg' links inside a ul/li list.
[02:01:01] <Cork> ok, provide info so i can help you or keep going on this route that won't lead you anywhere
[02:01:04] <Cork> i won't argue anymore
[02:01:12] <cpt-oblivious> what info is there to provide?
[02:01:20] <Cork> a link to the problem resource
[02:03:15] <cpt-oblivious> hmmm
[02:03:20] <cpt-oblivious> you are right Cork, my bad.
[02:03:53] <cpt-oblivious> apache source indeed is "a href=filename.jpg" instead of absolute paths, when you hover over the links it's firefox auto completing them into absolute paths.
[02:04:07] <Cork> ya, cause the browser is expected to do that
[02:04:24] <Cork> it is the hole point of relative urls
[02:04:41] <cpt-oblivious> apparently something called 'base path' exists for jquery load
[02:04:53] <cpt-oblivious> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17887199/why-does-jquery-load-not-handle-relative-links
[02:04:55] <cpt-oblivious> something like that
[02:05:04] <cpt-oblivious> but I'm not sure if that is more ugly that rewriting urls via regex
[02:05:11] <Cork> no there doesn't
[02:05:24] <Cork> what that snippet does is set a base path for the current page
[02:05:38] <Cork> meaning all your relative urls will go to that localtion
[02:05:41] <Cork> *location
[02:06:09] <cpt-oblivious> oh so that'll screw up my other links then
[02:06:16] <Cork> yes
[02:06:31] <cpt-oblivious> regex it is then...
[02:06:31] <Cork> you only have two options
[02:06:38] <Cork> 1. configure apache to generate absolute urls
[02:06:48] <Cork> 2. loop the links with js and fix them up
[02:07:48] <cpt-oblivious> no idea if 1 is possible with apache
[02:07:49] <cpt-oblivious> lets see
[02:09:37] <cpt-oblivious> "Absolute paths are not currently supported and do not match anything at runtime." fml
[02:14:40] <Darmani> Turbolinks stops my script from working until I reload the page. Has anyone run into this problem?
[02:15:30] <Cork> Darmani: you prob bind the handle on the element on page load
[02:15:34] <Cork> and that will break
[02:16:00] <Darmani> Cork: bind the handle?
[02:16:09] <Cork> $('selector').click for example
[02:16:34] <Darmani> Cork: Oh yeah I'm sure it will but I need js to load something before I do anything on the screen.
[02:16:58] <Cork> Darmani: not sure you can do that with turbolinks
[02:17:08] <Cork> it doesn't load a page so there are no before
[02:17:20] <Cork> it just injects part of the new page into the current page
[02:17:20] <Darmani> Cork: yeah that's what I figured. Might have to work without it.
[02:17:44] <Darmani> The problem is I have all my elements hidden by default and I use the js to show the first element.
[02:18:52] <Cork> ya, my experience is that turbolinks basically only works if you only use static html
[02:19:37] <Darmani> Cork: hmmm. Any ideas how I could show the first div if they are all hidden by default?
[02:19:47] <Darmani> I'm basically trying to make a carousel with JQuery.
[02:20:02] <Cork> you mean with turbolinks?
[02:20:04] <cpt-oblivious> Cork: is it cheating if I simply move my single .html page that references those links in that directory into that directory? :p
[02:20:07] <cpt-oblivious> it works now :p
[02:20:11] <Darmani> Cork: yeah
[02:20:18] <Cork> Darmani: i don't use tubolinks
[02:20:25] <Cork> too crappy
[02:20:29] <Darmani> Cork: Really? Do you find it more of a hindrance?
[02:20:36] <Cork> i don't need it
[02:20:56] <Darmani> Cork: What do you use for frontend?
[02:20:56] <Cork> i had a partial fetcher from links implemented in jquery years before they released turbolinks
[02:21:08] <Cork> Darmani: staright jquery basically
[02:21:30] <Darmani> Cork: hmm gotcha.
[02:21:51] <Darmani> Well I'll struggle with this a bit more, see if I can't find a solution.
[02:22:04] <Darmani> Otherwise Turbolinks is out like yesterdays garbage.
[02:44:56] <Darmani> yep. turbolinks your out.
[02:44:58] <Darmani> fuck that.
[02:52:21] <Darmani> hmm. This script is supposed to change the element depending on the navigation buttons but it doesn't load the next element when you click on it.
[02:52:22] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/71c912dfbb3ea002d4aeef6900cae8d1
[02:52:55] <Darmani> Is it because I initially set a class before I use the set the click event listener?
[02:54:04] <Cork> Darmani: why don't you just replace line 2 and 3 with $('.projectexample').addClass('active') ?
[02:54:16] <Cork> oh wait
[02:54:19] <Cork> Darmani: why don't you just replace line 2 and 3 with $('.projectexample').eq(0).addClass('active') ?
[02:54:50] <Darmani> Cork: Okay but that still doesn't solve my problem.
[02:55:03] <Cork> Darmani: and for the nextSlide just do $('.projecteample.active').next()
[02:55:27] <Cork> Darmani: it is prob that the elements aren't next to each other
[02:55:34] <Cork> .next() looks at the dom structure
[02:55:46] <Cork> you prob want .nextAll('.projectexample').first()
[02:55:59] <Darmani> ohh.
[02:56:20] <Cork> alternatively you can use .eq and the index
[02:57:06] <Darmani> Cork: Oddly enough, when you do use the nav arrows the next div fades in for a second and then goes back to the original div.
[02:57:28] <Cork> Darmani: could you generate a jsfiddle with the problem you have?
[02:57:44] <Darmani> Cork: sure. hang on.
[02:58:27] <jim_wang> what's jsfiddle?
[02:58:34] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[02:59:29] <jim_wang> oh! thanks
[03:02:30] <Darmani> Cork: Well this is the fiddle but I can't even get it to display one div haha
[03:02:31] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/0fxf3Lmo/
[03:03:32] <Cork> Darmani: the css is the problem
[03:03:41] <Cork> .projectexample wins over .active
[03:03:56] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/0fxf3Lmo/1/
[03:04:00] <Cork> opps miss
[03:04:11] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/0fxf3Lmo/2/
[03:05:54] <Darmani> okay but that doesn't fix the js that comes after.
[03:05:59] <Darmani> The nav button.
[03:06:07] <Cork> Darmani: so include it so i can help you with it :)
[03:06:35] <Darmani> Cork: lol alright hang on.
[03:10:07] <Darmani> Cork: hang on I'm writing it all out...
[03:10:17] <Cork> Darmani: no hurry
[03:12:12] <Darmani> Cork: alright. This obviously doesn't work.
[03:12:15] <Darmani> But it's what I have.
[03:12:16] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/0fxf3Lmo/3/
[03:12:34] <Darmani> shit hang on

[03:18:27] <Cork> and when we're at it https://jsfiddle.net/0fxf3Lmo/7/
[03:18:35] <Cork> Darmani: it filters a jquery collection
[03:18:57] <Cork> Darmani: http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[03:19:43] <Darmani> Cork: wow.
[03:19:47] <Darmani> I suck :[
[03:20:07] <Cork> na, don't be so hard at yourself
[03:20:23] <Cork> um... *on* :)
[03:20:51] <Darmani> Cork: I'm always hard at myself =p
[03:22:07] <Darmani> Cork: thank you though. I'm going to implement that into my code. I'll show you in a bit.
[03:35:28] <Darmani> Cork: sadly.
[03:35:31] <Darmani> truly sadly.
[03:35:40] <Darmani> Yours runs into the same problem mine did.
[03:35:43] <Darmani> I have no idea why.
[03:35:56] <Cork> Darmani: what problem is that?
[03:36:20] <Darmani> Like I said, it will show the next "slide" for like a second and then switch back to the original.
[03:36:26] * Darmani sighs
[03:36:36] <Cork> switch back...
[03:36:57] <Darmani> yeah it will "fade" into the next slide for a second and then fade back.
[03:37:05] <Cork> ah...
[03:37:13] <Darmani> Why would it do that? D:
[03:38:20] <Cork> Darmani: try https://jsfiddle.net/0fxf3Lmo/8/
[03:39:07] <Darmani> Cork: holy shit that looks what are you even doing there lol
[03:40:31] <Cork> Darmani: js animations are async
[03:40:54] <Cork> so slide.fade().remove/addClass is actually the same as slide.remove/addClass().fade()
[03:41:08] <Cork> you have to use the callback from the animation to wait until the animation is complete
[03:41:55] <Darmani> Cork: ah
[03:42:31] <Darmani> Cork: Well this is my js file. Hopefully I wrote it correctly.
[03:42:32] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/71c912dfbb3ea002d4aeef6900cae8d1
[03:43:21] <Cork> Darmani: the if statement should prob not be grouped with the animation, as it is about picking what is the nextSlide
[03:43:31] <Cork> but apart from that, yup
[03:43:59] <Darmani> Cork: No dice :[
[03:44:11] <Cork> still flippflopp?
[03:44:39] <Cork> sounds like you have a conflicting javascript somewhere on your page then
[03:45:28] <Darmani> Cork: I have external js files that are all grouped into one when I'm finished but this is the only file that I've created with js...
[03:45:51] <Cork> Darmani: ya, that doesn't really matter
[03:46:14] <Cork> if you have js in there that trigger on click or similar and does things with this content, it can break things for you
[03:46:35] <Cork> it is about the only reason i can think of right now for why it would break for you
[03:47:01] <Darmani> Cork: I mean you must be right... right? I can think of no other explanation either.
[03:47:16] <Cork> Darmani: there might be another reason
[03:47:28] <Cork> but i would need to see the problem to help more
[03:47:57] <Darmani> Cork: I could put into my Github? You could clone it but that's a lot of effort for a stranger XD
[03:48:14] <Cork> it is too much time for me ya
[03:48:20] <Cork> i'm working right now
[03:48:29] <Darmani> Cork: It's cool =p
[03:48:35] <Darmani> I'll figure it out or die trying
[03:48:36] <Darmani> =p
[03:58:56] <Darmani> Cork: I think I got it!
[03:59:05] <Darmani> Apparently a lot of other users experience the same problem.
[03:59:11] <Darmani> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33817490/ajax-json-get-reverts-all-jquery-after-page-load
[03:59:53] <Cork> ah, you got a full page reload...
[04:00:06] <Cork> i should have been able to predict that problem :/
[04:00:26] <Cork> Darmani: sidenote use event.preventDefault() not return false in the event handler
[04:00:27] <Darmani> Cork: Don't be so hard on yourself =p
[04:00:42] <Darmani> Cork: Does it matter?
[04:00:45] <Cork> yes
[04:00:52] <Cork> return false; kills the event
[04:00:57] <Cork> so no other script can ever use it
[04:01:04] <Cork> it makes the page hard to extend
[04:01:13] <Darmani> Cork: oh :o
[04:01:52] <Darmani> Cork: Do I have to apply this method to all my jQuery functions?
[04:02:25] <Cork> Darmani: event.preventDefault() is needed when the browser has a default action for the event
[04:02:38] <Cork> so click on links (if the link doesn't work you shouldn't use a link)
[04:02:43] <Cork> submit events on forms
[04:02:52] <Cork> (those are the two big ones)
[04:03:07] <Darmani> So what should I use?
[04:03:11] <Darmani> if not a link?
[04:03:21] <Cork> <button type="button">
[04:03:36] <Cork> you can style those basically how ever you like
[04:04:02] <Darmani> Cork: Ahh I see. The link was a full reset which in turn refreshes the browser which makes the script run all over again.
[04:04:24] <Cork> ya
[04:04:38] <Cork> Darmani: btw <button type="button"> doens't have a default action
[04:04:51] <Cork> so you don't need event.preventDefault() if you use one of those
[04:05:06] <Darmani> Cork: lmao I can't believe I didn't realize that hahaha
[04:05:10] <Darmani> I feel so dumb lmao
[04:05:34] <Cork> it is a bit noob, but it is common
[04:05:49] <Cork> so it comes up here about 3-4 times a day :)
[04:06:11] <Darmani> Cork: Haha bear with me. I just started using jQuery/JS in my apps about two days ago lol
[04:06:19] <Cork> Darmani: ya, no prob
[04:06:41] <Cork> Darmani: the only position when i start to get annoyed is when the developer doesn't know basic js syntax
[04:06:52] <Cork> like for statements of if, or how to modify a string
[04:07:01] <Cork> i expect them to at least have learned that much
[04:07:33] <Darmani> Cork: for sure, problems like that should work themselves out. Even a basic developer should know something like that or at least google it himself and find the answer.
[04:07:39] <Cork> what you experience is caveats and everyone needs help with those the first time you encounter them
[04:08:03] <Cork> Darmani: some of these are hard to google unless you know it is even a thing
[04:08:40] <Darmani> Cork: Right???? First it was turbolinks not allowing me to write jQuery properly, then it was a stupid link refreshing the whole goddamn script.
[04:08:42] <Darmani> fuck me lmao
[04:08:54] <Cork> :)
[04:09:12] <Cork> ya, i don't like much of the js rails introduces
[04:09:23] <Cork> i especially HATE coffiescript
[04:09:32] <Darmani> Cork: oh god. me too.
[04:20:56] <Darmani> shit creating an empty link that doesn't refresh a page is hard...
[04:21:00] <Darmani> Cork: D:
[04:22:31] <Cork> Darmani: you can't
[04:22:44] <Cork> cause links aren't meant to be like that
[04:23:01] <Cork> and is why i recommended using <button type="button>
[04:23:42] <Darmani> Cork: hm.
[04:23:43] <Darmani> okay.

[04:32:01] <jq2> How to check if data-index has class the do this?
[04:32:29] <Darmani> lmao
[04:32:47] <jq2> $('ul li').dataindex(1).hasClass('selected') { then do this } ?
[04:33:02] <Darmani> Cork: We had a guy in the #rails chat spend half an hour yelling at people trying to convince us of some weird propaganda he was selling.
[04:33:05] <Darmani> it was great lol
[04:33:28] <Cork> :)
[04:33:51] <Cork> jq2: .dataindex isn't a jquery function
[04:34:17] <Cork> jq2: and you need to use an if statement
[04:35:30] <jq2> Cork: yes, how to check data-index  ?
[04:35:59] <Cork> jq2: i would recommend inverting that check, it isn't efficient to write it like that
[04:36:26] <Cork> i would recommend if($('ul li.selected').data('index') == 1) {}
[04:36:29] <jq2> Cork: ok,, I cant go with index() ?
[04:36:45] <Cork> no
[04:36:49] <jq2> Cork: ok I would try that
[04:42:21] <jq2> https://jsfiddle.net/f1k1fqsb/
[04:42:41] <jq2> the text not changing when Choose B :/
[04:43:02] <Cork> ah
[04:43:13] <Cork> you looking for what element is selected
[04:43:18] <Cork> this doesn't work like that
[04:43:56] <jq2> https://jsfiddle.net/f1k1fqsb/1/

[04:48:39] <jq2> Cork: is there any chance to get out value of li ?
[04:48:55] <jq2> cause I dont have any value in my html
[04:49:11] <Cork> jq2: you used a <select><option> combination
[04:49:30] <Cork> jq2: if that isn't what you're using then what are you using?
[04:50:56] <jq2> an "li" list
[04:51:12] <Cork> ok, and what are you trying to do then?
[04:51:17] <jq2> something like tihs?
[04:51:18] <jq2> http://jsfiddle.net/yccyJ/1/
[04:51:32] <jq2> get value to the li
[04:52:07] <Cork> well if you want the position of the li you can just use .index()
[04:52:20] <Cork> no need for adding extra attributes
[04:52:35] <Cork> (also don't use alert for debugging, use console.log)
[04:55:56] <jq2> Cork: I want to add value to the html through jquery
[04:56:02] <jq2> =)
[04:56:29] <Cork> jq2: could you ask a full question instead of leading me around by the nose?
[04:57:44] <jq2> Cork: Yes, I have my li list with citys, and when i click on those i wanna change content of other divs
[04:58:23] <Cork> ok, so just use the .index() from the position of the li and use that to show a div with the same offset in the target area
[05:00:53] <jq2> ok, will try
[05:05:33] <jq2> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/yccyJ/666/
[05:06:27] <jq2> http://jsfiddle.net/yccyJ/667/
[05:06:59] <jq2> dont matter that is select and option.. those are ul li
[05:07:16] <jq2> just pretend that they are
[05:15:06] <_Justice_> Has anyone created buttons for bootbox dialog with jquery objects?
[05:18:09] <codecutter> Error: "jquery.min.js:4 Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation" on line 13 (i think line 16 is the actual cause) http://pastebin.com/25Vfr2KN
[05:20:39] <Justice> trying to use jquery objects with $('<i>') and $('<span>') for the label but all I get in the end is object object.
[05:21:29] <Darmani> Alright I'm off to bed. Thanks again Cork. I'm sure I'll be back here. I owe you one.
[05:22:32] <Cork> codecutter: you need to turn off parsing by $.ajax if you use formdata
[05:22:59] <codecutter> how do i do that (whatever that means)?
[05:23:14] <Cork> codecutter: processData: false, contentType: false,
[05:23:20] <codecutter> ah!
[05:23:54] <Cork> the first one is the cause of the error
[05:24:02] <Cork> the second is so it works correctly server side
[05:36:09] <Hollusionist> .attr('checked') == false <-- is this the correct way to check if a checkbox is unchecked? or do you know a better way?
[05:36:17] <Cork> no
[05:36:24] <Cork> never use attr to check state
[05:36:32] <Hollusionist> prop?
[05:36:36] <Cork> if you are in an event handler on that element, just use this.checked
[05:36:42] <Cork> else $().prop('checked')
[05:36:57] <Hollusionist> that will return true or false?
[05:37:09] <Cork> it will return if it is checked
[05:37:23] <Cork> (that name kinda states what it means)
[05:37:40] <Cork> if you meant if it is a boolean, then yes
[05:38:27] <Hollusionist> .prop('checked', false) will this also work to set the state?
[05:38:32] <Cork> yes
[05:38:37] <Cork> or this.checked = true
[05:38:42] <Hollusionist> thank you Cork
[05:38:45] <Cork> np
[05:39:15] <Hollusionist> there is no such thing as prop('unchecked')
[05:39:16] <Hollusionist> right?
[05:39:23] <Cork> nope
[05:39:33] <Cork> prop is a jquery way of accessing the dom properties
[05:39:48] <Cork> and the property holding the state on the dom is "checked"
[05:40:34] <Duikb00t> Is there a non-plugin way to detect fast when an item is visibile in the browsers window?
[05:40:55] <Cork> a way, sure, fast, no
[05:41:00] <Duikb00t> dammit  :D
[05:41:01] <Hollusionist> only when trying to access/edit real attributes like "name" or "value" one should use .attr() ?
[05:41:09] <Cork> Hollusionist: no
[05:41:29] <Cork> Hollusionist: you should only use attr when you need to access the attribute of the dom element
[05:41:33] <Cork> and you very rarely need that
[05:41:43] <Cork> (i only know of two situations)
[05:42:13] <Hollusionist> would you tell me those two please? :)
[05:42:18] <Hollusionist> unless they are too complex
[05:42:21] <Cork> $('a').attr('href') gives you the url entered in the html while $('a').prop('href') gives you the expanded version (full url with protocol and everything)
[05:42:37] <Cork> and setting data- attributes if you want them to be on the dom element
[05:42:41] <Cork> .prop can't do that
[05:42:50] <Cork> everything else should be .prop
[05:42:57] <Hollusionist> doesnt .data() do that?
[05:43:07] <Cork> no it stores it inside jquery
[05:43:13] <Hollusionist> i see
[05:43:17] <Cork> and it populates that cache from data- if there are no entry
[05:45:01] <Hollusionist> what about if i want to set name="" or id="" ?
[05:45:11] <Cork> prop('id', 'bla')
[05:45:19] <Cork> same for name
[05:45:31] <Hollusionist> okay, thank you again
[05:49:29] <Hollusionist> sorry for asking again but i would like to know why prop is preferred over attr
[05:49:41] <Hollusionist> can you explain that or have an article about it?
[05:53:01] <Cork> Hollusionist: back in 1.5 (if i remember correctly) attr was split into two functions
[05:53:49] <Cork> the old attr internally did setAttribute/getAttribute when it was considered it is "what you wanted" and in the other cases it did elm[key] = value
[05:54:19] <Cork> Hollusionist: prop always does elm[key] = value and this is what browsers expect you to modify for it to notice the changes
[05:54:38] <Cork> not all browsers has listeners for setAttribute, so it might not trigger the state
[05:54:56] <Cork> also getAttribute ALWAYS returns a string, while properties might be other types of data
[05:55:07] <Cork> like boolean
[05:55:49] <Cork> ex getAttribute('checked') == "checked" or getAttribute('checked') == ""
[05:56:11] <Cork> but that doesn't reflect the state of the element, only what the html was when it was parsed
[05:56:34] <Hollusionist> super good explanation! thank you very much agaibn
[05:56:36] <Hollusionist> *again
[06:06:12] <ThemNuts> hi guys, how can i see if a combo of 2 select options is already set? I can add rows with 2 selects on click with several options (YES /NO) - (Do this / Do that / Do ..). I only want to allow one combo of each
[06:06:52] <Cork> ThemNuts: you have to use the change event on the select options
[06:07:00] <Cork> and either hide other based on it
[06:07:10] <Cork> or show validation errors
[06:07:14] * Cork afk
[06:08:06] <jquery623> Hi, is there a better way to do this?
[06:08:07] <ThemNuts> this is what i got atm http://pastebin.com/0bnmc7Wi
[06:08:07] <jquery623> https://jsfiddle.net/zaL8bh7n/
[06:15:07] <ThemNuts> i think i need to check for a combo of the two selects instead of looking at them seperate like (this && that) but can't figure out how
[06:15:37] <Hollusionist> jquery623: there is no htm?
[06:15:43] <Hollusionist> html
[06:17:02] <Hollusionist> jquery623: i think you want .prop('selected') instead of .hasClass()
[06:38:34] <codecutter> multipart.MultipartException: The current request is not a multipart request (Server Error)  http://pastebin.com/Darpn4m0
[06:43:27] <Cork> jquery623/jq2: please stop waisting ppls time, if you want help show a consistent example of what you are trying to do
[06:43:42] <Cork> keeping jumping between ui/li and select/option isn't possible
[06:43:42] <codecutter> multipart.MultipartException: The current request is not a multipart request (Server Error)  http://pastebin.com/Darpn4m0
[06:44:58] <Cork> codecutter: you are makeing a get request with formdata...
[06:45:20] <codecutter> should it be post?
[06:45:32] <Cork> as get means the data is in the url
[06:46:29] <codecutter> let me try 'post'
[07:02:26] <CodingCookie> maybe someone could help and figure out why this doesn't work. I'm doing a few kinda similar animatios on a website. My idea was to write a function get more DRY code. http://hastebin.com/vukahilabo.coffee
[07:03:25] <CodingCookie> the only problem i have is, that the animation itself don't work. it displays allready but the .animate thing doesn't work :S
[07:03:45] <Cork> CodingCookie: try reproducing the effect in a jsfiddle
[07:03:55] <Cork> it would make it easier to see the problem
[07:06:00] <CodingCookie> ok i will do a jsfiddle.
[07:17:08] <CodingCookie> https://jsfiddle.net/zu16j3om/3/
[07:17:49] <CodingCookie> https://jsfiddle.net/zu16j3om/5/
[07:17:55] <CodingCookie> wrong link sorry^:/
[07:20:47] <Cork> CodingCookie: what part of the animation isn't working?
[07:20:51] <Cork> looks fine here
[07:21:01] <Cork> (btw have you considered using css3 transition instead?
[07:24:26] <CodingCookie> i want to write a function, so that i don't need to write the code again and again just because of the animatefunction. I've only heared of CSS3 Animations
[07:25:12] <Cork> CodingCookie: https://jsfiddle.net/zu16j3om/7/
[07:25:20] <Cork> not much to write again and again :)
[07:26:15] <Cork> (i recommend using classes instead of id in the css then it doesn't need to be repeated)
[07:27:25] <CodingCookie> ok thanks. that's really smart. Actually i never used css transform, or animations
[08:11:06] <rokshis> Guys, how do you guys deal with webpack HMR, when using $(document).ready()? Thing is, I have to reload the page manually in order for it to initialize the $(document).ready state. Is there an existing way to fix this somehow?
[08:16:50] <CodingCookie> Cork: hey cork iam still here. I'm trying to change my code to CSS3 animations with classes. Actually i think my transition doesn't work correctly. On click i add a class with the endposition of the element, like you did in the jsfiddle
[08:17:27] <Cork> CodingCookie: i didn't use animations, i used transition
[08:17:39] <Cork> unless you need multi state animations you don't need to specify one
[08:23:45] <taurgal> Could someone order the following selectors by speed?
[08:24:45] <taurgal> "mycontainer table > tr", "mycontainer table tr", "mycontainer tr"
[08:24:55] <Cork> taurgal: from right to left
[08:25:13] <taurgal> Cork: right is quickest?
[08:25:17] <Cork> yes
[08:25:33] <Cork> taurgal: what the browser will do is find that the current element is a tr
[08:25:45] <Cork> so it has to look up for a parent matching #mycontainer
[08:26:14] <Cork> in the middle it has to check that a parent is table and it has a parent is mycontainer
[08:26:29] <taurgal> Cork: simple..
[08:26:40] <Cork> and the first has to check each elements direct parent to ensure it specifically is the parent
[08:26:41] <jankex> Hello
[08:27:22] <jankex> is it possible to  pass array of selectors like this var x = [jQuery("li.post-7217"), jQuery("li.post-6986")];
[08:27:22] <Cork> taurgal: that said, the last and second last should be very close to the same speed
[08:27:44] <Cork> jankex: pass it to what?
[08:28:07] <Cork> if they except a jquery object, then no
[08:28:24] <Cork> what you most likely want is jQuery("li.post-7217, li.post-6986")
[08:28:43] <taurgal> Cork: So I should avoid ">" when it is not necessary?
[08:28:49] <Cork> taurgal: yes
[08:29:09] <Cork> taurgal: also note this is the current state of engines
[08:29:18] <Cork> it changes as they find common slowdowns
[08:29:24] <Cork> so it isn't a fixed state
[08:29:31] <jankex_> https://jsfiddle.net/2rd4s4Ly/
[08:29:33] <Cork> (though the fast selectors won't ever get slower)
[08:29:52] <Cork> jankex_: ya, see my comment before
[08:29:55] <Cork> it is what you want
[08:30:04] <jankex_> I am trying to make an array of multiple selectors to perform prepend()
[08:30:16] <jankex_> sorry the browser logged out
[08:30:23] <jankex_> so i can not reach your comment
[08:30:24] <Cork> what you most likely want is jQuery("li.post-7217, li.post-6986") <--
[08:30:49] <jankex_> is it better like this i mean faster
[08:30:57] <jankex_> or doing it in an array
[08:31:05] <Cork> jankex_: no it is the only way you can run .find on it later
[08:31:19] <jankex_> i am using find to fast things up
[08:31:23] <Cork> well or you would have to merge the array into a jquery object
[08:31:37] <Cork> Jakey: there are no .find on arrays
[08:31:50] <jankex_> thanks for this info
[08:32:02] <jankex_> so if i put it in an object
[08:32:06] <jankex_> it will work thought ?
[08:32:08] <Cork> jankex_: so you can pass an array of strings (the selectors)
[08:32:21] <Cork> jankex_: it needs to be a jquery object
[08:32:27] <Cork> not just any object
[08:32:48] <Cork> so you have two options pass in the selectors and nothing else
[08:33:06] <Cork> or pass in a jquery object holding all the elements you want to work with
[08:34:45] <jankex_> https://jsfiddle.net/2rd4s4Ly/1/
[08:34:47] <jankex_> like this ?
[08:35:03] <Cork> yup
[08:35:35] <decx> now make your function accept x as a parameter instead of this leaked state stuff
[08:35:44] <decx> *argument
[08:35:45] <Cork> heh
[08:35:52] <Cork> ya, my thought too
[08:36:14] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/2rd4s4Ly/2/
[08:36:34] <decx> as a rule of thumb, it's always good practise to keep your functions clear of outside interference
[08:37:02] <Cork> well unless the situations when you need to share state
[08:37:33] <Cork> unless.... except
[08:37:38] <decx> well rules of thumbs arent binding ^^
[08:38:02] <jankex_> okie i got this
[08:38:36] <jankex_> but the function is not running
[08:38:50] <jankex_> how to fix this undefined issue
[08:39:10] <Cork> decx: ya, but ppl can tend to be obsessed about rules
[08:39:38] <Cork> jankex_: you need jquery
[08:39:47] <decx> people just want constants in their life
[08:39:53] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/2rd4s4Ly/4/
[08:40:25] <ThemNuts> How can i check to see if a combo of the 2 inputs (per row) alread exist? https://jsfiddle.net/q46eeg5x/1/
[08:40:39] <jankex_> yea i added jquery and i tested live on my site
[08:40:45] <jankex_> not running
[08:40:55] <jankex_> with undefined console error
[08:40:56] <Cork> ThemNuts: check selector.val()
[08:41:14] <Cork> jankex_: in what browser?
[08:41:21] <jankex_> chroe
[08:41:24] <jankex_> chrome*
[08:41:56] <Cork> you get console is undefined??
[08:42:02] <Cork> there is no console call in that fiddle...
[08:42:16] <ThemNuts> Cork: its not just checking to see if the val length > 1, i need to find out if select1+select2 is already selected (they can't select the same combo twice)
[08:42:51] <decx> well you're not gonna see much anyway because of mixed contents
[08:43:09] <Cork> ThemNuts: so take $(select1).val() == $(select3).val() && $(select2).val() == $(this).val()
[08:43:31] <decx> better to abstract it
[08:43:49] <decx> maybe map your rows inputs into a string
[08:44:04] <ThemNuts> so i figured that the length of select 1 && 2 > 1 would do the job but that gives me an erro
[08:44:17] <Cork> length??
[08:44:21] <ThemNuts> yeah thought about that to, i need to combine the 2 and check on that
[08:44:43] <Cork> ThemNuts: what is select in your case?
[08:45:23] <ThemNuts> check the fiddle Cork, might explain it beter than i can with my poor enlgish
[08:45:52] <ThemNuts> i use length to see if the val already exists and count those. If the count > 1 i know it exists so -> no go
[08:46:02] <jankex_> i am trying it on a live website
[08:46:22] <ThemNuts> but that dont work with select having 2 optoins and select 2 having 4
[08:48:45] <Cork> ThemNuts: well how do you want to prevent the combination?
[08:48:54] <Cork> validation error?
[08:49:06] <jankex_> https://jsfiddle.net/2rd4s4Ly/8/
[08:49:09] <ThemNuts> yeah showing this option is already se
[08:49:28] <ThemNuts> set*
[08:54:02] <Viddax> Is it possible to execute Esc Key?
[08:54:22] <Viddax> Click on a button to execute Esc key?
[08:55:27] <decx> create an event keydown with a second argument that has a which
[08:55:41] <decx> iirc
[08:55:52] <Viddax> Ah
[08:56:15] <Viddax> I don't want listen keydown event
[08:56:25] <Viddax> it is action.
[08:58:06] <decx> like $.Event('keydown', { which: 27})
[08:58:18] <decx> and then trigger(event)
[08:58:28] <Viddax> Oh
[08:58:29] <Viddax> Thanks!
[09:01:17] <Cork> ThemNuts: https://jsfiddle.net/q46eeg5x/3/
[09:01:25] <Cork> something like that is what i would recommend
[09:04:41] <ThemNuts> Cork: looks like what i need. Can you explain what happens?
[09:05:08] <Cork> ThemNuts: line 2 grabs the row for the current change select
[09:05:17] <Cork> then i grab the condition and type from that row
[09:05:30] <Cork> the i grab all other type and condition selects (line 6 and 7)
[09:05:33] <Viddax> var input = tr.find('input[type=text]');
[09:05:40] <Viddax> Is there a mistake that line?
[09:05:41] <Cork> excluding the ones from the current row
[09:05:57] <Cork> then i filter out the ones matching the condition and type from the current row
[09:06:09] <Cork> and check if any of them are from the same row
[09:06:18] <Viddax> Cork Oh, I just need first input type=text
[09:06:32] <Cork> Viddax: that commend wasn't for you
[09:06:39] <Viddax> oh
[09:06:51] <Cork> Viddax: the only thing is you should quote attribute values
[09:07:20] <Cork> else it should work fine as long as the dom nesting is correct (a tr can't have a direct child of type input)
[09:08:13] <Viddax> I see.
[09:08:58] <ThemNuts> that looks awesome Cork, thanks a bunch for taking the time!
[09:09:10] <Cork> ThemNuts: np
[09:10:25] <decx> other approach btw https://jsfiddle.net/decx/q46eeg5x/4/
[09:16:23] <Viddax> Any mistake in this?
[09:16:25] <Viddax> $(this).closest('tr');
[09:16:38] <Cork> Viddax: question need context
[09:17:17] <Viddax> A button in td: <tr> <td> </td>  <td> <button> button> <td> <tr>
[09:17:32] <Viddax> I like to get that row tr object
[09:17:42] <Cork> Viddax: jsfiddle.net please
[09:17:58] <Viddax>    $("table tr.inline-edit").on('click', '.inline-btn-group-edit', function () { $(this).closest('tr'); });
[09:18:04] <Viddax> Ok
[09:19:10] <decx> that does what it's supposed to, nothing
[09:20:30] <Viddax> I know, I am doing full version now on jsfiddle
[10:10:48] <Ty__> Does anyone know why a video speed variable wouldn't reset, but it doesn't keep it's speed effect either?
[10:16:39] <Ty__> So basically, I have a video playlist that uses buttons to increase/decrease the video speed. When the video changes to the next video in the playlist, it keeps the 150% speed variable, but reverts the actual speed back to normal. As it is right now, on load of the second video, a user needs to click down a speed, then click up to resume 150%. I'd like to make it so whatever speed they were watching on, continues through out the playli
[10:16:55] <Ty__> I have a JS Fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/cj6c544o/
[10:43:29] <IamTrying> While using $.ajax and async:false can it be the cause of Google Chrome. Awwww Swap of crap like that?
[10:43:53] <IamTrying> Should i not use async:true? to not let the browser get frozen?
[10:44:07] <taplar> you shouldn't use async:false and in fact it has been removed in later jquery versions
[10:44:13] <Cork> IamTrying: you shouldn't use async: anything
[10:44:29] <Cork> it is deprecated and removed in latest jquery
[10:44:38] <Cork> and a bad idea cross the board
[10:45:09] <Cork> IamTrying: and yes, it is among other reasons cause it hangs the browser until the data comes back
[10:45:42] <IamTrying> OK  - Guru now it make sense, i had a terrible demo today, browser in Kiosk was crashing over and over. Cork
[10:45:48] <IamTrying> thank you very clear now.
[10:46:31] <taplar> kinda interesting that chrome would crash with that
[10:46:56] <Cork> it prob doesn't crash, many ppl call hanging "crash"
[10:47:17] <taplar> ah, i'm just imagining that chrome was like i'm not putting up with your shenanighans
[10:47:26] <Cork> :)
[10:48:02] <IamTrying> YEA lol to stress it out loude, hanging we call "crash"
[10:48:27] <Cork> ya, crash means something completely different though...
[10:48:44] <taplar> we call that "hung"
[10:48:54] <Cork> cause that is what it is...
[10:48:58] <taplar> lol
[10:49:20] <taplar> it's hung up, now if you cut the noose, sure, it will probably crash
[10:49:33] <Cork> but ya, i've been helping enough ppl with browser problems to directly connect this now days
[10:49:53] <Cork> "my browser crashed"; "oh, ok goto <url> and send us the crash report"
[10:49:58] <IamTrying> So from: `return $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: node_server + input,async: false, success:function(m) {buf1 = m;}}).responseText; ` to:
[10:50:03] <IamTrying> Like this? return $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: node_server + input, success:function(m) {buf1 = m;}}).responseText;
[10:50:04] <Cork> "there are no crash reports" ...
[10:50:16] <Cork> IamTrying: no
[10:50:28] <Cork> IamTrying: you can't access responseText like that at all with async ajax
[10:50:42] <IamTrying> I need to get the texts Guru from my node_server
[10:51:05] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[10:51:10] <Cork> you will prob have quite a bit of rewriting to do
[10:51:23] <Cork> cause your app is prob written to be syncronous and that won't work
[10:52:16] <IamTrying> OK - i think i will put a timer and read the buffer later instead of waiting real-time
[10:52:22] <Cork> ...
[10:52:39] <taplar> read that link i shared
[10:52:52] <taplar> you need to learn about promises and all the ajax things
[10:52:56] <Cork> ya
[10:53:05] <IamTrying> OK
[10:53:09] <taplar> otherwise you are trying to go counter to the paradigm
[10:53:33] <Cork> and as more and more of the browser api is going to this, you are going to be in a future of pain if you don't
[10:53:49] <taplar> and seriously, once you get it, it's like, wtf, it's just that?
[10:54:08] <Cork> eh, no not really
[10:54:21] <Cork> it requires you to think in a quite different way
[10:54:36] <taplar> i mean once you understand the callbacks or the whole then() pattern
[10:55:19] <Cork> ya, but you risk haveing func(function(data) { return newData; });
[10:55:26] <Cork> and those will not be fun to deal with
[10:56:08] <taplar> true.  i could be taking knowledge for granted, :)
[10:56:31] <Cork> i lived through a time when most libraries you found expected sync data...
[10:56:48] <Cork> so i had to jumble around things to get async to work..
[10:56:50] <Cork> not fun...
[10:57:12] <taplar> hmm, around when did it flip?
[10:57:13] <Cork> "oh, just return an array with the new data you want in the list"
[10:57:27] <Cork> not that many year ago actually
[10:57:40] <Cork> i would say around 2010 or so
[10:57:48] <taplar> dang
[10:58:03] <Cork> heck google groups are still using sync ajax...
[10:58:08] <Cork> :/
[10:58:35] <taplar> huh, i thought a lot of google was websockets now.  dunno why i thought that
[10:58:48] <Cork> google groups is a legacy half dead system
[11:00:50] <Uhkis> isn't is based on the ye olde news?
[11:01:07] <Cork> groups is a mail agregation site
[11:01:14] <Cork> it isn't related to news
[11:01:47] <Cork> (or at least that is what it is normally used for)
[11:02:11] <taplar> ah, good old mailing lists
[11:03:23] <Uhkis> by news i meant the alt.music.metal etc that was a thing in the 90s
[11:03:42] <Cork> a news groups
[11:03:54] <Cork> no, it wasn't ever connected to that as far as i know
[11:09:21] <bounceman> What should of effect should I use in this scenario: If I hover div a overlay will fadein. However I only want it to fade in if you keep the mouse on that div for 1000ms ?
[11:09:39] <bounceman> To avoid fadein spam basically
[11:11:17] <taplar> that's a debounce
[11:39:39] <z1haze_work> is there a way in a .each() function to basically skip one of the elements?
[11:40:05] <taplar> you could do an if to skip the logic
[11:40:07] <z1haze_work> I have a situation where if there is more than 1 of an element, i need to skip the first one, and apply the stuff inside the .each to all of the others
[11:40:22] <z1haze_work> but if theres only 1 of the element i need to apply it to that one
[11:40:32] <z1haze_work> trying to think of a way where i dont have to duplicate code
[11:41:13] <taplar> what is the identifying aspect that makes them duplicates?
[11:41:19] <z1haze_work> class
[11:41:26] <z1haze_work> i basically have a wrapper class for each product
[11:41:32] <z1haze_work> and some pages show more than one product in a product set
[11:41:45] <z1haze_work> but the whole page wrapper also has the same class..
[11:42:17] <z1haze_work> so a page with multi[ple products will be wrapped all together in a single .pdp-main element, but then each product within it will have its own .pdp-main
[11:42:24] <taplar> so you want only the classes within that class?
[11:42:49] <taplar> so.... $('.pdp-main').find('.pdp-main').each()
[11:42:51] <z1haze_work> here's what ive got currently http://dpaste.com/3KDH1RH
[11:43:31] <z1haze_work> but inside this, if there is only 1 total .pdp-main element, i run this code, but if there is more than one .pdp-main element, i skip the first one and apply to the rest
[11:43:41] <z1haze_work> every way ive come up with im basically duplicating code
[11:44:33] <taplar> $('.pdp-main').find('.pdp-main').each()
[11:44:49] <z1haze_work> no
[11:44:57] <z1haze_work> there may only be 1 .pdp-main
[11:45:04] <z1haze_work> in that case it wont run
[11:45:08] <taplar> ._<
[11:45:11] <taplar> >_<
[11:45:14] <z1haze_work> yea? haha
[11:45:20] <z1haze_work> for a single .pdp-main element it must run this code
[11:45:32] <z1haze_work> if there are more than 1 .pdp-main element on the page it must run this code for each one, skipping the first one
[11:45:51] <z1haze_work> because if theres more than one, i treat the first one just a a wrapper
[11:46:36] <taplar> maybe some use of http://api.jquery.com/has/
[11:47:13] <taplar> with a combination of not()
[11:47:54] <z1haze_work> i guess i coudl just put the internal stuff in a function
[11:48:05] <z1haze_work> then i wouldnt have to worry about duplicating anyway
[11:48:28] <shoky> var mains = $('.pdp-main');  if (mains.length > 1) { mains = mains.slice(1); }    mains.each(...);
[11:49:01] <z1haze_work> slice im assuming strips the first one?
[11:49:11] <z1haze_work> or it says start at 2
[11:49:15] <shoky> it's same as array slice
[11:49:23] <z1haze_work> so start at the scond index
[11:49:24] <z1haze_work> cool
[11:49:34] <z1haze_work> i like it thanks man
[11:50:32] <taplar> alternatively you could put another class on the top level
[11:51:08] <taplar> $().not(otherClass).each
[11:51:34] <z1haze_work> yea its not really the best setup anyway,
[11:52:03] <z1haze_work> its an old site, adding a new functionality and they dont want to pay for a rewrite of a bunch of stuff
[11:52:27] <taplar> slice works, but i'd think $('.pdp-main').not('.multiple-pdp-main').each() would be a little more readable
[11:52:39] <z1haze_work> im making comments
[11:52:49] <taplar> self documentation man
[11:52:57] <shoky> ya the slice suggestion was just a response to "i want to select either just one, or all but the first"
[11:53:09] <taplar> if you have to make a comment to explain something in code, that means it's unclear
[11:53:09] <z1haze_work> yea shoky thats exactly what i needed
[11:53:19] <z1haze_work> taplar:i agree
[11:53:23] <shoky> z1haze_work that's what you decided you needed
[11:53:27] <shoky> but there's probably better solutions ;]
[11:53:31] <shoky> as taplar's saying
[11:53:32] <z1haze_work> sure this one is easy
[11:53:36] <z1haze_work> like i said
[11:53:39] <z1haze_work> they dotn want to pay
[11:53:52] <shoky> ok, adding a class shouldn't cost much though :D
[11:55:15] <taplar> i guess this is like a freelance thing?
[11:55:24] <taplar> you are doing for someone?
[11:55:26] <robertmaxrees> if you're not getting paid, it's not a job ;)
[11:55:46] <taplar> well, i'm leading up to the question of if he will have to support it in the future
[11:55:57] <taplar> which then he really should care about readability
[12:03:23] <z1haze_work> no they are paying
[12:03:28] <z1haze_work> just for only these changes
[12:03:30] <z1haze_work> and no, not freelance
[12:10:55] <z1haze_work> anyone here use the owl-carousel?
[12:11:28] <z1haze_work> trying to figure out this changed.owl.carousel event, console log the target shits out like 10 elements from this event - shouldnt it only be one?
[12:16:01] <morlenxus> Hey, how to correctly arrange input fields and buttons in jqueryui dialogs? Is it correct to use a table or should i use something like fieldset?
[12:16:44] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work "console log the target" as in the event.target?
[12:17:14] <robertmaxrees> the docs seem pretty clear about that event.
[13:15:17] <ABM_Dan> trying to work on a very simple plugin (https://gist.github.com/ABM-Dan/e1ab4aca1e4cfe5809e1cd3a672f740f) but for some reason, on line 10/11 instead of looping through all the options, only the first one is parsed.
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen with that return.
[13:16:08] <ABM_Dan> it's something that coffeescript puts in automatically.
[13:16:26] <robertmaxrees> so line 11 makes no sense.
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> in that context, 'this' refers to $.fn.each
[13:16:53] <ABM_Dan> hm
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees>  so i'm confused about what this is trying to accomplish.
[13:17:04] <ABM_Dan> for each select (multiple or not)
[13:17:10] <ABM_Dan> I want to go through each node
[13:17:16] <ABM_Dan> sorry, option child node
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, you want to set the selected option?:
[13:17:33] <ABM_Dan> and set its selected attribute (dom) to the value of defaultSelected
[13:17:47] <robertmaxrees> this.defaultSelected is the problem i'm guessing
[13:17:52] <robertmaxrees> you getting any console errors?
[13:17:54] <ABM_Dan> hmm, not sure if I should say property or attribute
[13:17:59] <robertmaxrees> property.
[13:18:04] <robertmaxrees> attributes are in html.
[13:18:06] <ABM_Dan> nope.
[13:18:12] <robertmaxrees> that's weird.
[13:18:43] <robertmaxrees> try console logging in there.
[13:18:44] <ABM_Dan> ok, so, for each select I want the child option nodes to have the selected property to match their defaultSelected property.
[13:18:50] <ABM_Dan> Sorry, I like a clean summary.
[13:19:00] <robertmaxrees> but my guess is that it's erroring on the first one.
[13:19:28] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[13:19:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:19:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see a fiddle then.
[13:19:33] <decx> why dont you just reset() the form
[13:19:38] <ABM_Dan> More likely it's returning false and somehow breaking the cycle.
[13:19:38] <robertmaxrees> or do that ^
[13:19:38] <decx> it's like... built in
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> .each() doesn't listen to what returns.
[13:19:47] <ABM_Dan> decx: I need to reset only some fields :)
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> also: why use coffeescript these dayus?
[13:20:04] <robertmaxrees> *days
[13:20:05] <decx> yeah each is for mutation
[13:20:15] <ABM_Dan> robertmaxrees: please don't scope out.
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm just askin' yo.
[13:20:54] <ABM_Dan> robertmaxrees: it's not relevant to the matter at hand, that's all.
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:21:40] <taplar> i only want the answer i want?
[13:21:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:21:55] <taplar> narrow
[13:22:45] <robertmaxrees> this channel lately.  yeesh
[13:23:00] <ABM_Dan> Ok, pretend there's no javascript
[13:23:04] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[13:23:08] * taplar cries
[13:23:08] <robertmaxrees> glad your problem is solved then!
[13:23:10] <ABM_Dan> sorry, no coffeescript.
[13:23:10] <robertmaxrees> congrats :)
[13:23:15] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:23:39] <robertmaxrees> dude it was just a simple question - something else to consider.  i wasn't suggesting you like rip out all your coffeescript or whatever.
[13:23:53] <robertmaxrees> just something to keep in mind for the future.
[13:24:18] <ABM_Dan> I learned that discussing tools and languages can quickly derail the discussion,.
[13:24:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:24:34] <robertmaxrees> whatevs mang.
[13:24:37] <ABM_Dan> but apparently trying not to get into a derailing discussion is its own form of derailment.
[13:24:47] <robertmaxrees> so!  back to the matter AT HAND - gotta fiddle for us?
[13:25:31] <ABM_Dan> http://jsfiddle.net/bcAzG/376/
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> so how do i test this?
[13:26:53] <ABM_Dan> you change the fields, then press the reset button and that resets that row of fields.
[13:27:25] <robertmaxrees> so specifically just the multiselect is the issue here?
[13:28:22] <ABM_Dan> I think the single select is also broken.
[13:28:57] <ABM_Dan> And I think the issue is that return this.selected = this.defaultSelected; sometimes returns false which breaks the .each cycle.
[13:29:23] <taplar> i didn't think each() returned
[13:29:27] <taplar> *anything
[13:29:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bcAzG/378/
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> .each() is weird.
[13:29:45] <ABM_Dan> #theMoreYouKnow
[13:29:51] <robertmaxrees> so it's the return that coffees- I MEAN, UH, JUST REMOVE THE RETURN THERE.
[13:29:52] <robertmaxrees> YEP.
[13:30:14] <ABM_Dan> I'll just add an empty return at the end of the function.
[13:30:19] <ABM_Dan> Thank you for the assistance.
[13:30:42] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:30:57] <ABM_Dan> it's not like I exposed you to the coffee at all, come on.
[13:31:10] <decx> it's a hint: write functional bro
[13:31:18] <robertmaxrees> literally nothing to do with that and everything to do with your response to my attempt at some helpful advice.
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> oh wait
[13:31:25] <robertmaxrees> we're DERAILING again ;)
[13:31:39] <ABM_Dan> I'm working in an environment that is not made of just me and my opinions, I have to do what I can.
[13:31:45] <taplar> we're removing ruby?
[13:31:48] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/#each-function -> "You can stop the loop from within the callback function by returning false."
[13:32:21] <robertmaxrees> weird.  i guess i've never returned anything out of $.fn.each before.
[13:32:50] <taplar> ABM_Dan: how does that mean you have to respond in here in a manner that could be considered .... whatever the word is
[13:32:53] <taplar> abrassive?
[13:33:18] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'm guessing the response is based on past interactions :) it's all good.
[13:33:22] <ABM_Dan> professional?
[13:33:28] <taplar> un
[13:33:30] <decx> wait so each() is like Array.some?
[13:33:35] <robertmaxrees> that was absolutely unprofessional in my opinion
[13:33:37] <robertmaxrees> decx nope.
[13:33:45] <robertmaxrees> doesn't return anything other that the original object.
[13:33:54] <robertmaxrees> array.some is meant to return a bool.
[13:34:25] <ABM_Dan> "please don't scope out" is so professional it's dry.
[13:34:38] <robertmaxrees> let's just drop it. if you'd like to talk more, feel free to PM me.
[13:35:07] <ABM_Dan> I'm good.
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:35:40] <ABM_Dan> But I am thankful, I know more about .each now.
[13:36:00] <decx> didnt know you could break with return false either
[13:36:06] <decx> neat
[13:36:11] <taplar> there's map() if you want to return stuff
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> in a different format.
[13:42:59] <decx> generally you'd think that return false would just break the current iteration tho
[13:43:12] <decx> i dont know if i like it or hate it
[13:43:34] <taplar> i usually filter first, but i'm sure it has it's uses
[13:43:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:44:08] <decx> if (this.textContent === 'ignore this') return false;
[13:44:14] <decx> i just broke my loop
[13:44:26] <decx> alright, i hate it ^^
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:44:54] <taplar> for a brief second i thought you said 'laptop'
[13:45:11] <decx> that's because it's thursday and you need a break cuh
[13:45:21] <taplar> yeah, after lunch brain death
[13:49:19] * drej hugs robertmaxrees 
[13:49:22] <drej> miss you :x
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> ohai
[13:49:52] <robertmaxrees> <3
[13:50:03] <robertmaxrees> I'm setting up a bunch of stuff on ghostlab right now.
[13:50:12] <drej> oh fun
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> very.  i got moved to doing project lead work for our probile platform.
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> got a lot to learn.
[13:50:54] <drej> neat
[13:50:57] <drej> whats a probile platform
[13:51:06] <robertmaxrees> errrrr.
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> mobile
[13:51:12] <robertmaxrees> derp
[13:51:18] <decx> somebody else needs a break too
[13:51:20] <drej> maybe you should learn to get that right first if you're the lead
[13:51:23] <drej> i mean, im no expert
[13:51:24] <taplar> alien technology
[13:51:24] <decx> that's not even a typo
[13:51:35] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:51:44] <robertmaxrees> i haven't really been sleeping enough.
[13:51:46] <robertmaxrees> it sucks.
[13:52:00] <taplar> or a platform that promotes fiber intake
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ why not.
[14:12:23] <alexander25> hi everyone is there an nice way to prevent 3 checkboxes from ever beeing not selected or more than 1?
[14:12:34] <alexander25> i have this 3 checkboxes that should only be allowed to be selected 1time
[14:12:37] <robertmaxrees> sure - use radio buttons instead :)
[14:12:39] <alexander25> 1 out of 3
[14:12:49] <alexander25> yes i know but im in the need of checkboxes due to styling issues
[14:14:20] <taplar> you "must" have the checkbox?
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah - what kind of styling issues?
[14:14:53] <taplar> cause you can do radio buttons, hide them, and make a label the visible user interactable element for styling
[14:14:56] <alexander25> im build a search form and everything is a checkbo
[14:15:05] <alexander25> *checkbox so for consistency
[14:15:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:15:18] <robertmaxrees> that'll confused end users to no end fwiw.
[14:15:20] <taplar> that's not good ui man
[14:15:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll completely break their expectation
[14:16:04] <taplar> plus extra logic that already exists in the html specification
[14:21:19] <taplar> easy enough to style: https://jsfiddle.net/r7gbocdz/
[14:24:40] <rjCousineau> Hi, how do I wrap element?
[14:24:59] <rjCousineau> $('<ul>').wrap($('<li>')).appendTo('body') ?
[14:25:18] <drej> rjCousineau: http://i.pud.ca/313E1t0m353u
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:26:33] <rjCousineau> sigh..
[14:26:41] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau yes, that's how you'd do tht.
[14:26:58] <rjCousineau> lol
[14:27:10] <rjCousineau> cuz working not.. thought to ask
[14:27:16] <robertmaxrees> maybe try a fiddle?>
[14:27:48] <rjCousineau> fiddles fix all
[14:28:44] <drej> giggidy
[14:29:49] <robertmaxrees> oh, flip it.
[14:30:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x4cc8prp/
[14:32:21] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: i don't see <UL> in the dom
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> "This method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes."
[14:33:58] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:34:02] <robertmaxrees> you're still only appending the li.
[14:34:39] <robertmaxrees> because .wrap() returns the original element.
[14:36:09] <rjCousineau> hmm
[14:51:38] <blizzkid> hi all, I have the following line in one page:
[14:52:28] <blizzkid> socket.on('redirect', function(dest) { window.location.href = destination; });
[14:52:58] <blizzkid> in another page I have this line:
[14:53:52] <blizzkid> $('form').submit(function(){ socket.emit('redirect', "round2"); } return false; });
[14:54:23] <blizzkid> yet, when I trigger that submit, the page is not redirected in the other browser page
[14:54:42] <robertmaxrees> because your redirect is on another page...?
[14:55:01] <blizzkid> robertmaxrees: isn't that the purpose of a websocket?
[14:55:13] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:55:20] <robertmaxrees> the other page isn't loaded.
[14:55:30] <robertmaxrees> so how would the current page know what bindings are on it?
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> oooh derp.
[14:56:01] <blizzkid> robertmaxrees: let me rephrase: using websockets, I should be able to "push" a page reload, no?
[14:56:06] <robertmaxrees> reread your question. so you're confused about how websockets work.
[14:56:22] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[14:57:36] <robertmaxrees> and iirc sockets are for client-server, not between windows.
[14:57:40] <robertmaxrees> but i could be wrong.
[14:58:44] <blizzkid> robertmaxrees: true, but I should be able to trigger an event from 1 window/browser that triggers a reload/redirect in another window/browser as long as both are connected
[14:58:51] <robertmaxrees> to the same server
[14:58:56] <blizzkid> hence the example of a chat application
[14:59:00] <blizzkid> robertmaxrees: of course
[14:59:02] <robertmaxrees> so the server would need to emit that event back to the other window.
[14:59:10] <blizzkid> robertmaxrees: of course
[14:59:36] <blizzkid> hold on...
[15:00:14] <blizzkid> http://pastebin.com/9GzSa7KL ==> server.js
[15:00:37] <robertmaxrees> does jquery even support websocket events?
[15:00:45] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't imagine it does.
[15:00:56] <blizzkid> http://pastebin.com/0pHDZDss ==> page1.html
[15:02:22] <blizzkid> http://pastebin.com/ZxTifYvy ==> the advance triggering page
[15:02:30] <robertmaxrees> see what i said about jquery and sockets?
[15:02:44] <blizzkid> robertmaxrees: yes, it does
[15:02:47] <robertmaxrees> does it?
[15:02:48] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:03:02] <blizzkid> if you look at the example files, the messaging part works
[15:03:27] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[15:03:45] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript might know more since i'm out of my depth w/r/t sockets these days.
[15:04:03] <blizzkid> :) I'll give it a go
[15:06:07] <user_corrupt> I'm doing      $('#vote-form').submit();      to submit a form... how can I pass a variable for the form to POST?  Normally I just do             <button name='vote' value='{{ $variableIwantToPOST }}' class='vote-button' type='submit' form='vote-form'></button>
[15:06:26] <robertmaxrees> user_corrupt it's a basic form post?
[15:06:32] <user_corrupt> yeah
[15:06:40] <robertmaxrees> gotta add an input then.
[15:09:11] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: ok, so if I pass the variable to the function that I call to do    $('#vote-form').submit();     then how might I go about using that variable to add the input?
[15:09:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't, really.
[15:10:20] <robertmaxrees> the trigger form of submit doesn't take arguments.
[15:11:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink your strategy here a bit.
[15:12:04] <robertmaxrees> instead of calling submit, call a function that adds a hidden input with your value to the form and then call submit()
[15:12:11] <robertmaxrees> though what are you adding to the form that you need?
[15:15:42] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: I see. Just the     value='{{ $variableIwantToPOST }}'     part... it's a vote value
[15:16:03] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[15:16:10] <robertmaxrees> why not have a normal input for that?
[15:17:24] <user_corrupt> you mean the button that I normally use to submit? I'm trying to submit through JS so that I can disable the button as soon as it's clicked.. trying to prevent multiple clicks
[15:17:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:17:48] <robertmaxrees> i mean for the vote value.
[15:18:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to disable multiple submit clicks, just disable the submit button when the user submits the form.
[15:18:43] <user_corrupt> I'm using variables because I have multiple buttons with multiple possible values
[15:18:53] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:18:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:19:10] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah - each button corresponds with a vote?
[15:19:15] <user_corrupt> yeah
[15:19:27] <robertmaxrees> so you setup a variety of forms.
[15:19:33] <robertmaxrees> each one corresponds to each vote.
[15:19:41] <robertmaxrees> on submit of any of these, disable the submit button.
[15:27:03] <MACscr> im not using a form with this demo, yet when i change the date, i want to actually do a GET request to the current url. So page is foo.php, i want to get the date ranges as values in the url. https://fiddle.jshell.net/8f7ghkyo/. As you can see though, im not actulally using a form there.
[15:27:26] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to GET via ajax then?
[15:28:34] <MACscr> nope, page refresh is fine
[15:28:49] <robertmaxrees> then you can construct a URL and do window.href = theUrl
[15:28:52] <MACscr> as i want to be able to bookmark/share that url
[15:30:55] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: I tried                   <button name='vote' value='{{ $answerZero }}' class='vote-button' type='submit' form='vote-form' onclick="this.disabled = true;" >{{ $answerZero }}</button>       but now it does not submit my form
[15:31:09] <robertmaxrees> user_corrupt because you want to bind to the form's submit event.
[15:31:19] <robertmaxrees> and use jquery for the binding.
[15:31:28] <user_corrupt> I see, thanks
[15:31:56] <robertmaxrees> if that still doesn't work, dunno what to tell you other than to look into a server-side solution to prevent multiple sibmissions
[15:40:03] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: does this at least look right? http://paste.ee/p/aUnlK
[15:42:44] <Buoy172> user_corrupt: looks right to me
[15:42:52] <robertmaxrees> to bind to a submit event for one form?  yeah?
[15:46:16] <robertmaxrees> also: .on() is preferred these days to .bind()
[16:00:05] <user_corrupt> Buoy172: I finally got the listener to react to submit events... now my problem is that I don't know how to then disable all buttons with vote-button class.. I've tried and it does nothing          $('.vote-button').disabled = true;     any suggestions?
[16:00:25] <robertmaxrees> user_corrupt .prop('disabled', true)
[16:13:27] <user_corrupt> for some reason my listener only works when I do the second example in the following: http://paste.ee/p/61pxL is that a valid way to do a listener?
[16:14:44] <robertmaxrees> what verison of jquery are you using?
[16:21:06] <user_corrupt> 2.1.4
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:24:36] <robertmaxrees> something sounds way broken there.
[17:00:40] <lucenut> Hi
[17:00:50] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[17:00:55] <lucenut> I am making a call to colorbox like this: $.fn.colorbox({ href:url });
[17:01:07] <lucenut> This is the url: var url = "docs/divs/div_udPages.cfm?page_id=" + pid + "&field_id=" + fid + "&parent_id=" + parid + "&option_value=" + optv;
[17:01:33] <lucenut> The option_value optv is fine and the colorbox dialog opens when there is just one word in the optv, but when there is a comma and another word it just comes up blank.
[17:01:44] <lucenut> That make any sense?
[17:03:07] <robertmaxrees> not really?
[17:04:35] <lucenut> I can dump the optv value right before the colorbox call and it's just a string. If it has a comma in it, the dialogue is blank and just a little square.
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it fail, then.
[17:05:57] <lucenut> I don't know how else to troubleshoot it.
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> make a standalone test case in a jsfiddle?
[17:33:27] <taplar> yeah, non-empty pot of coffee after 16:30.  it's like i found the holy grail up in here
[17:36:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:36:30] <robertmaxrees> it EXISTS.
[17:36:32] <robertmaxrees> IT'S REAL.
[17:36:54] <taplar> it's crazy, i mean i know the day is almost gone, but some times i need some juice
[17:38:14] <Darmani> hey guys, why isn't this working?
[17:38:14] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/
[17:39:10] <robertmaxrees> $(projects[0]).addClass('active');
[17:39:17] <robertmaxrees> you want projects.eq(0)
[17:39:22] <robertmaxrees> don't send it back through jquery
[17:39:58] <Darmani> wat
[17:40:00] <robertmaxrees> also: you were missing jquery in your fiddle.
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> $(projects[0]) .> projects.eq(0) or projects.first()
[17:41:11] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: so... Don't wrap the variable in jQuery?
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> you've already got a jquery object.
[17:42:11] <robertmaxrees> no need to do it all over again
[17:42:37] <robertmaxrees> .eq() gives you a jquery-fied element
[17:43:14] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/4/
[17:43:16] <Darmani> still doesn't work tho
[17:43:36] <robertmaxrees> read up again for your second probloem.
[17:43:39] <robertmaxrees> *problem
[17:44:13] <Darmani> do I have to include jquery in my code as a link first?
[17:44:25] <robertmaxrees> see that javascript heading with a gear icon?
[17:44:40] <Darmani> yeah...
[17:44:45] <robertmaxrees> click that, then "Frameworks & extensions"  pick a stable version of jquery (not edge)
[17:44:51] <robertmaxrees> hit "update" on the fiddle.
[17:45:12] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: 3.1.9?
[17:45:15] <Darmani> 3.1.0*?
[17:45:21] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:45:23] <robertmaxrees> if you want.
[17:45:39] <Darmani> cool it works :D
[17:45:42] <Darmani> I didn't know you had to do that.
[17:45:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:45:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't automatically included everywhere.
[17:45:59] <Darmani> I've got a harder one for you, hang on.
[17:46:09] <Darmani> I'm gonna call you Gandalf from now on.
[17:46:53] <taplar> hah, back to the wizard stuff
[18:06:23] <Darmani> okay
[18:06:31] <Darmani> Only took me three years but I finally recreated what I have
[18:06:49] <Darmani> now how the fuck do I get these dots to change depending on the slide that's showing atm?
[18:06:50] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/5/
[18:07:03] <robertmaxrees> you're building a carousel.
[18:07:23] <robertmaxrees> why not use one of the dozens of available plugins to do this?
[18:08:07] <Darmani> ehh I'm the point is to learn right?
[18:08:27] <robertmaxrees> sooo carousels are a pretty bad idea overall. http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[18:08:46] <robertmaxrees> that being said, you can tie these together by index.
[18:09:11] <Darmani> lmaooo
[18:09:17] <Darmani> Shouldiuseacarousel.com
[18:09:19] <Darmani> that's great.
[18:10:08] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I can tie these together by index? o.o
[18:10:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:10:27] <robertmaxrees> but i'd really avoid this or use a plugin.
[18:10:30] <robertmaxrees> like, learning is all good.
[18:10:35] <robertmaxrees> but learn something actually usable.
[18:10:44] <Darmani> like what -____-
[18:10:51] <robertmaxrees> how to use a carousel, for instance.
[18:10:57] <Darmani> ?????????????
[18:11:01] <Darmani> You just said I shouldn't use one
[18:11:05] <Darmani> now I need to learn how to use one.
[18:11:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:11:11] <robertmaxrees> giving you ideas mang.
[18:11:15] <Darmani> dafuq
[18:11:21] * Darmani kicks your shin
[18:11:27] <robertmaxrees> i mean, if you're set on using one, use a plugin.
[18:11:39] <Darmani> NO
[18:11:42] <robertmaxrees> don't recreate something that's been done to death.
[18:11:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, do somethin' else.
[18:11:51] <Darmani> like what
[18:12:02] <robertmaxrees> make a todo list app.
[18:12:15] <Darmani> that's too easy. I'm talking about cool shit that moves on a page.
[18:12:24] <Darmani> like some frontend shit that people like to see.
[18:12:35] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to build up a resume?
[18:12:52] <Darmani> ehhh I already have one. I'm trying to build up my front end skillz =p
[18:13:20] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like you could do a todolist that remembers what the user entered, down drag and drop for priorities, includes tagging, etc.
[18:13:50] <Darmani> hm.
[18:14:04] <Darmani> I guess I could do that. Sounds like a challenge.
[18:14:09] <Darmani> AFTER i finish this carousel
[18:14:10] <Darmani> =p
[18:14:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:14:24] <Darmani> now for the love of god
[18:14:29] <Darmani> how do I get these dots to change
[18:14:38] <robertmaxrees> get the index of the current active slide
[18:14:50] <robertmaxrees> set active or w/e on that particular dot.
[18:15:18] <Darmani> uh huh....
[18:15:34] <Darmani> then what
[18:15:39] <robertmaxrees> that's it.
[18:15:48] <Darmani> wat
[18:15:51] <robertmaxrees> just gotta add/remove the right classes.
[18:15:58] <robertmaxrees> why would you need to do anything else?
[18:16:16] <Darmani> I did that earlier by myself and it didn't work. Maybe I did it wrong.
[18:16:19] <robertmaxrees> show us
[18:16:20] <Darmani> lemme try again.
[18:16:24] <Darmani> yeah yeah hang on.
[18:18:47] <Darmani> what the hell
[18:18:54] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: now my slides aren't showing -.-
[18:18:55] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/6/
[18:19:07] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[18:19:37] <Darmani> on fiddle?
[18:19:42] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:20:07] <Darmani> holy shit so many errors lol
[18:20:13] <robertmaxrees> just one big one.
[18:20:22] <robertmaxrees> var currentDot =
[18:20:51] <Darmani> oh goddamnit
[18:20:54] <Darmani> -.-
[18:21:22] <Darmani> kk hang on
[18:23:49] <Darmani> wait okay here's where I get stuck
[18:24:06] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: What am I actually doing with the dots? I mean I'm not hiding them.
[18:24:17] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/7/
[18:24:40] <robertmaxrees> think about it.
[18:24:49] <Darmani> NO
[18:24:51] <Darmani> That's why I have you
[18:24:52] <Darmani> lol
[18:24:57] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:25:02] <robertmaxrees> so what makes that one dot look different?
[18:25:11] <Darmani> it's a different kind of dot.
[18:25:45] <robertmaxrees> and what makes it that different kind of dot?
[18:25:53] <Darmani> it's filled in.
[18:26:05] <robertmaxrees> by what mechanism do you make that happen?
[18:26:24] <Darmani> uhh I just grabbed it from the font-awesome website.
[18:26:30] <robertmaxrees> right so look at the html duder
[18:26:34] <robertmaxrees> not gonna look for you.
[18:26:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:26:47] <robertmaxrees> what in the html makes it look different?
[18:27:08] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: so... I have to remove the class, change the class to normal, grab the "nextDot" take off that class and then add the new one?
[18:27:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:27:37] <Darmani> how primitive.
[18:27:47] <robertmaxrees> what else would you expect?
[18:27:57] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: idk you're Gandalf you tell me =p
[18:28:05] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:33:30] <Darmani> well that didn't work.
[18:33:32] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/8/
[18:34:33] <Smegal> what's up with the stray binding outside of the doc ready?
[18:34:56] * Darmani looks around
[18:35:01] <Darmani> are you talking to me?
[18:35:05] <Smegal> yup
[18:35:09] <Darmani> wat
[18:35:13] <robertmaxrees> also: i.fa.fa-circle
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> that is not a classname
[18:35:27] <Smegal> ah, nvm, indentations threw me off
[18:35:42] <robertmaxrees> fa-circle is
[18:36:00] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: it still works I just don't know how to define 'next-dot'.
[18:36:06] <Darmani> That's where the script doesn't change.
[18:36:12] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:36:22] <Darmani> o.o
[18:36:31] <robertmaxrees> you still need to fix it.
[18:36:42] * Darmani sighs
[18:36:58] <Darmani> there.
[18:37:00] <Darmani> now what.
[18:37:36] <robertmaxrees> $('dots');
[18:37:38] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:37:50] <Smegal> heh, was fixing to paste that
[18:37:59] <Darmani> oh shit
[18:38:11] <Darmani> fixed.
[18:38:35] <robertmaxrees> also: you can just do .next()
[18:39:55] <Darmani> nopp
[18:40:06] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/9/
[18:40:38] <Darmani> oops I changed something I shouldn't have
[18:40:40] <Darmani> hang on lol
[18:41:22] <Darmani> okay better
[18:41:23] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/10/
[18:41:28] <Darmani> dots are still fucked tho.
[18:43:00] <robertmaxrees> fa.fa-circle
[18:43:19] <robertmaxrees> still not a classname
[18:43:22] <taplar> currentDot.fadeOut(600).removeClass('fa.fa-circle'); <-- this seems weird
[18:43:29] <taplar> the fadeOut won't block
[18:43:46] <taplar> then there's a fade in afterwards
[18:44:09] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I tried just doing one fa but then it messed up the input from font-awesome
[18:44:20] <robertmaxrees> you want fa-circle
[18:44:51] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: done.
[18:45:00] <Darmani> taplar: yeah did you see that too?
[18:45:09] <taplar> the class thing?
[18:45:27] <taplar> not really, i'm just a magi, not gandalf class
[18:45:28] <Darmani> well it fades out but it fades in again
[18:45:33] <Darmani> hahahaha
[18:45:56] <robertmaxrees> ditch the fade stuff real quick.
[18:46:12] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: is it bad? o.o
[18:46:20] <robertmaxrees> simplify
[18:46:42] <Darmani> fine...
[18:47:15] <robertmaxrees> start simple.
[18:47:16] <robertmaxrees> baby steps.
[18:47:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:47:28] <Darmani> none of this fixes the problem.
[18:47:31] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[18:47:36] <robertmaxrees> it makes troubleshooting easier.
[18:47:47] <Darmani> uggg
[18:47:52] <robertmaxrees> show me the latest.
[18:48:05] <taplar> if all works, if you add a small thing and things break, easier to debug
[18:48:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:48:18] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/d5d3Lctq/11/
[18:48:27] <Darmani> taplar: okay magi
[18:49:25] <taplar> still got the class combo in your removeClass addClass
[18:49:32] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:49:44] <robertmaxrees> your nextdot vs currentdot stuff is all wont.
[18:49:48] <taplar> you don't have to whole sale remove everything to remove a class
[18:49:48] <Darmani> oh my bad
[18:50:35] <Darmani> okay no more fades.
[18:51:00] <robertmaxrees> your .next() call is your problem heh.  sorry, thought you'd read the docs some more.
[18:51:26] <Darmani> I only did that cause you suggested it D:
[18:51:35] <robertmaxrees> i thought you'd read the docs.
[18:51:46] <Darmani> I did. I didn't memorize them -.-
[18:51:56] <robertmaxrees> so what does .next() do?
[18:52:18] <robertmaxrees> gets the next sibling.
[18:52:20] <Darmani> it grabs the next sibling item
[18:52:24] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:52:28] <robertmaxrees> your dots arent siblings.
[18:52:33] <robertmaxrees> they're nested in <li>s
[18:53:05] <Darmani> okay...
[18:53:18] <robertmaxrees> so you gotta go to the parent li, then go to the next one.
[18:53:24] <robertmaxrees> then find the child i element.
[18:54:00] <Darmani> i'm not sure what that would look like.
[18:54:22] <robertmaxrees> so break that down.
[18:54:29] <robertmaxrees> go to the parent li - know how you'd do that?
[18:54:54] <Darmani> uuuuuuummmmm. li:first-child?
[18:55:01] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:55:05] <Darmani> dots.first();?
[18:55:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:55:16] <robertmaxrees> i hate when people do that.
[18:55:18] <Darmani> yourmom.js?
[18:55:22] <Darmani> I have no idea lol
[18:55:22] <robertmaxrees> not funny.
[18:55:32] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[18:55:47] <Darmani> oh cool .parent();
[18:55:57] <robertmaxrees> there's also .closest(), but start with parent
[18:56:04] <taplar> the api is your friend
[18:56:18] <robertmaxrees> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+get+parent+element would've worked well, too.
[18:56:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:56:38] <Darmani> woaaaah

[22:13:06] <aro> does anyone know why shown.bs.modal is not firing? i have it in my document and ive bound it to the id of the modal, but it isnt showing
[22:14:15] <D-rex> use .on() maybe?
[22:14:50] <taplar> it's a bootstrap thing.  should work out of the box.  can you make a fiddle?
[22:15:39] <aro> i cant make a fiddle, its on our prod site
[22:15:43] <aro> you can see it there
[22:15:54] <taplar> a small example of the issue is preferred
[22:16:27] <taplar> sometimes trying to recreate the issue in fiddle will also cause you to find the error
[22:17:37] <aro> can i use codepen
[22:18:05] <taplar> i'm not as familiar with it, but sure
[22:18:37] <aro> i cant actually do it, we are using flowplayer in it, and thats causing it to break in fiddle
[22:19:22] <aro> and D-rex: we are
[22:19:23] <aro> $('#myModal1').off('hidden.bs.modal').on('hidden.bs.modal', function (e) {
[22:20:05] <taplar> wait, your unregistering that handler?
[22:20:50] <aro> removing other bindings
[22:21:01] <taplar> if you comment out that logic does the modal display as normal?
[22:21:05] <aro> no
[22:21:53] <aro> well, let me check again
[22:22:00] <aro> remove the unregister piece right
[22:22:41] <taplar> the whole thing for now
[22:22:51] <taplar> but yes it's the unregister i'm concerned with
[22:23:27] <aro> yeah no its still not firing
[22:23:39] <aro> the modal displays fine
[22:23:45] <aro> its just that the callback events are not
[22:23:50] <taplar> wait, i thought you said it wasn't displaying
[22:24:15] <aro> no - i said that shown/hidden.bs.modal doesnt fire
[22:24:19] <aro> sorry
[22:24:24] <aro> i said isnt showing at teh end of it
[22:24:26] <aro> bad choice of words
[22:24:39] <aro> No - the modal displays fine, it just doesnt fire the events
[22:26:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5yL6rcgd/1/
[22:26:21] <taplar> took the html from the site.  seems to fire
[22:27:04] <aro> https://www.vwcourtsettlement.com/en/
[22:27:28] <aro> wait
[22:27:33] <aro> hm.
[22:27:48] <aro> no
[22:28:00] <aro> yeah try clicking on those videos at 'Videos and How-To Info'
[22:28:23] <taplar> it scrolls me, no modal
[22:28:58] <aro> click on the image
[22:29:02] <aro> with the play button
[22:29:35] <taplar> ah, the picture has a play icon on it so i thought it was a video link
[22:29:36] <taplar> :s
[22:29:59] <aro> it should pop open a modal
[22:31:03] <taplar> well your setup differs from the example a bit
[22:31:11] <taplar> your doing a link rather than a data-target
[22:31:19] <aro> data-target?
[22:31:30] <taplar> look at that fiddle i shared
[22:31:45] <aro> let me try that
[22:31:46] <aro> hang on
[22:32:27] <taplar> i dunno what's broken really.  not a big bootstrap guy.  but with the example you should be able to compare to see how you differ to experiment
[22:38:11] <ClydeSlims> I'm trying to check an event when someone starts typing in an input. It works on desktops but on mobile the event never gets called: $("input").keypress(function(){ console.log("test"); });
[22:39:04] <taplar> try 'input' instead of keypress
[22:39:16] <taplar> $('input').on('input', function(){ ... });
[22:40:15] <taplar> i'm not sure on a touch device what, if anything, would register a 'keyboard' event
[22:40:57] <ClydeSlims> taplar: Nope, still not getting called.
[22:41:04] <ClydeSlims> on desktop it gets called, on mobile, no
[22:41:11] <taplar> hmmm
[22:41:16] <ClydeSlims> using .on('input', function(){
[22:46:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/665hgava/ this works on my android device
[22:47:08] <ClydeSlims> taplar: Yeah not working for me. However the 'focus' event will do what I want so I'm good.
[22:47:11] <aro> hey taplar
[22:47:20] <taplar> sup
[22:47:22] <aro> i got it working.. it was weird
[22:47:28] <taplar> what was it?
[22:47:31] <aro> i changed $( to jQuery(
[22:47:35] <taplar> ah
[22:47:37] <aro> i wonder if there was a conflict
[22:47:41] <taplar> your running in no conflict
[22:48:15] <aro> good to knwo
[22:48:20] <taplar> ya, you can just do jQuery(function($){ /* your code here */ }); and go on with life, :)
[22:54:51] <taplar> one more day and then the weekend, whoo hoo!
