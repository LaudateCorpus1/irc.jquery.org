[09:40:59] <errorous> Hello. What am I doing wrong here? I'm trying to get all objects from an array that have defined property x, compared to an array which holds property names to check
[09:41:00] <errorous> https://jsfiddle.net/20jpkb7z/3/
[10:32:46] <errorous> for anyone that wants to know, I should have checked whether $.inArray outputs -1
[10:50:53] <Minnen> greetings, im having issues getting Slick Slider to work properly on my site, i think i did everything according to the official site instructions yet once everything is in place the slider doesnt work, it just shows the images one on top of the other, i made a stackoverflow post about it perhaps i explained better there https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60398364/slick-slider-not-working-properly-in-bootstrap-4
[11:39:58] <adder> why does slideUp("slow") slide up both submenus, when it should be sliding up only the one clicked? https://codepen.io/lbastos/pen/zYGZYwJ
[11:40:11] <adder> i tried to console.log it, and indeed the object is of length 1
[11:40:28] <adder> why is it then sliding up both my menus?
[11:40:31] <adder> i.e., submenus
[11:40:45] <adder> i assume the same would happen with > 2 submenus, it wuold slide them all
[11:42:19] <z1haze> I am loading a script with $.getScript within a module that is included multiple places on the page. I have wrapping the call to getScript in a condition to check if the script is loaded, but i guess if the requests happen to close together, sometimes the script still gets loaded twice. Any ideas on this?
[16:21:16] <Guest96> hi
[16:21:45] <Guest96> I have an interesting error.
[16:22:06] <Guest96> Can Somebody help me?
[16:28:19] <Guest96> I have a input field and I want bind a function to change event with .on('change', function () { ...} ); It's work well in most browsers, but not in edge.
[16:28:59] <Guest96> If i use blur event its work well in edge too.
[16:34:26] <littleFighter> Somebody?
[16:38:17] <errorous> hello. has anyone used query datatables with nvd3 charts?
[16:38:41] <errorous> if so, is there a way to automatically add datatables data into nvd3 chart?
[16:43:10] <Cork> littleFighter: change should work fine in edge
[16:44:56] <Cork> littleFighter: if you want more information you would have to share the code you have problem with
[16:46:49] <littleFighter> Cork: https://test.bankmonitor.hu/embed/szechenyi-hitel/ if you click the orange button, you can see 4 input field. the second field is that which has problem
[16:47:55] <littleFighter> if you write in console: $('[name="companyFoundYear"]').on('change', function() { console.log('1234'); });
[16:49:43] <Cork> littleFighter: if you write $._data($('[name="companyFoundYear"]')[0], 'events') (in edge) is the event listed there?
[16:49:53] <Cork> (i don't have edge so can't test the code)
[16:51:15] <littleFighter> yes
[16:51:28] <Cork> interesting...
[16:51:48] <Cork> and no errors at all in the console?
[16:52:54] <littleFighter> I have an error: Unable to get property 'isPersonal' of undefined or null reference in
[16:53:18] <littleFighter> but it is not my code
[16:54:00] <Cork> littleFighter: doesn't matter errors can often cause ending execution to stop
[16:54:29] <Cork> comment out the code that throws the error or what ever, but make sure you have a zero error environment
[16:55:36] <littleFighter> but it is a default edge extension: (ms-browser-extension://autoformfill_5ed10d46bd7e47deb1f3685d2c0fce08/content/Autoformfill_ContentScript.js)
[16:55:58] <Cork> ah, well that isn't even in the page context that's fine
[16:56:15] <Cork> where are you binding the event handler?
[16:56:51] <littleFighter> and I get this error when a load the page, not while I change the field content
[16:56:59] <Cork> also you're loading a ton of javascript, i would prob try disabling as much of it as possible to make sure none of those are interfering
[16:57:45] <Cork> start reducing your test case, cause this is too many things that can cause it to be much you can do about it
[16:59:18] <littleFighter> It is not too easy :)
[16:59:28] <Cork> it is
[16:59:41] <Cork> create a html file on a test server and add just the form
[16:59:51] <Cork> then copy your javascript for the form and start from there
[17:00:02] <Cork> for example
[17:00:35] <Cork> debugging like two screens full with script tags guessing at what might cause the handler to not work is impossible
[17:01:05] <Cork> anyone of them can have bound an event handler with event.stopImedeatePropagation()
[17:01:14] <Cork> or a return false;
[17:01:18] <Cork> or...
[17:01:38] <littleFighter> ok i do
[17:01:39] <Cork> some developers love to kill events assuming noone else cares about those events
[17:01:52] <Cork> making extending the page a nightmare
[17:04:57] <littleFighter> It is a good idea but It work well in chrome
[17:05:55] <Cork> littleFighter: it might be a slight change in event flow so the event handler is bound later
[17:06:04] <Cork> or it might be code checking useragent
[17:06:21] <Cork> you will have to start asserting where your problem really are
[17:06:54] <Cork> and as forms works ok normally in edge it isn't likely it is the cause
[17:07:11] <Cork> (also you never showed the code for the handler you have problem with)
[17:08:34] * Cork afk (sleeping)
[17:08:45] <littleFighter> typescript
[17:08:51] <littleFighter> with class

[17:14:55] <littleFighter> have a nice dream
