[02:03:47] <paule32> hello, and good morning
[02:04:06] <paule32> i have a problem with this paste script: http://dpaste.com/3WGSKZC
[02:04:36] <paule32> the SUCCESS dialog will be show, login seems to be to set true
[02:05:22] <paule32> but in line 18, "login" seems to be false, either true (line: 9)
[02:06:01] <paule32> because, line: 20 will not be affected
[02:06:41] <paule32> is there a magic wrong?
[02:42:16] <pavonia> Not sure I fully understand, but the problem is probably that .ajax() is asynchronous
[02:42:25] <pavonia> paule32: ^
[12:12:41] <tona> hello evryone,
