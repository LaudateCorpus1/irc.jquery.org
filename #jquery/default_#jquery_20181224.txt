[05:52:01] <CoderGuy> is the only way to change a pages url without refreshing the page to use history.pushstate or to use an anchor tag I.E. #something-here
[08:12:56] <CoderGuy> i'm trying to simulate an Anchor click without there being an anchor there
[08:13:41] <CoderGuy> so this works in pure css a href = "#hi"  I want to change that to just a href = "hi" but I still want to on click have the effect of the anchor tag that was there go off
[08:17:37] <pavonia> Why?
[08:18:10] <CoderGuy> because I have a pure css layout that already works
[08:18:14] <CoderGuy> but it works with anchor tags
[08:18:49] <CoderGuy> and so I want to replace the anchor tags with real links, but still activate the effect
[08:19:51] <CoderGuy> it's either this or I decode how the css is working and then implement js calls....but seems a bit much if it already works just on anchor click...
[08:21:20] <pavonia> Sorry, I don't understand. You have <a href="#foo"> tags that link to targets on the same page, and want to replace those by href="foo" that still link to the local targets?
[08:21:50] <CoderGuy> so it won't link to the targets
[08:21:57] <CoderGuy> but I want jquery to pretend it does
[08:22:28] <CoderGuy> the links will obviously point to their link location, but I have jquery to preventdefault action on the href...and then I want to trigger what would have happened
[08:23:28] <CoderGuy> so it will work as if it's a href = "#foo"   but I will have a href = "anythingbutananchortaghere"
[08:24:44] <pavonia> When would the effect of href = "anythingbutananchortaghere" show up?
[08:26:52] <CoderGuy> when you click on the href
[08:26:59] <CoderGuy> and the jquery function is executed
[08:27:23] <CoderGuy> do you know what gets called when an anchor tag is clicked? I just want to call that dynamically
[08:27:31] <pavonia> But you just said "so it will work as if it's a href = "#foo"" which means it links to the original target
[08:27:49] <CoderGuy> okay sooo i'll just show you something and you can answer
[08:28:01] <CoderGuy> https://codepen.io/ind88/pen/MzoKzP?page=1&
[08:28:15] <CoderGuy> notice when you click on the cat pictures, a nice bigger photo shows up via lightbox
[08:28:47] <CoderGuy> the true effect here is that each image has an a href on it, the href contains an anchor tag so for example a href = "#lightbox-image-3"
[08:29:18] <CoderGuy> I want to cause the actions that occure when clicking on the a href = "#lightbox-image-3"  but I want my href to be ANYTHING BUT an anchor tag
[08:29:53] <CoderGuy> which means I have to overrwrite the default action of my href. And in overwriting it, I want to say the original thing that happens here, I just don't know what is actually happening when the anchor href goes off
[08:30:19] <CoderGuy> so far I can overwrite the href, and that's all fine.. I just don't know what actually gets called in the default anchor tag clicking
[08:32:34] <pavonia> The default effect is "window.location.href = ... what is in the href ...", I think. So with a combination of preventDefault, you can add an arbitrary hook into that handler
[08:33:57] <CoderGuy> so you gave part 1 of the default action...but what is part 2
[08:34:13] <CoderGuy> what is the part that reads the href & goes "oh look an anchor #" "okay when I see an anchor I do X"
[08:35:57] <pavonia> $(elem).attr("href") or what do you mean?
[08:39:11] <CoderGuy> I mean when you click on an anchor tagged element
[08:39:20] <CoderGuy> the page clearly goes to that element and makes it visible
[08:39:34] <CoderGuy> so what is being called when you click on an anchor tagged element
[08:39:45] <CoderGuy> why are the photos in my example showing up? what is happening there?
[08:42:15] <pavonia> It's CSS magic using the :target selector
[08:43:25] <CoderGuy> so how can I cause the :target selector to go off using javascript?
[08:52:49] <pavonia> CoderGuy: You set window.location.href
[08:53:15] <CoderGuy> so there is no other way of doing it?
[08:53:29] <pavonia> Not that I know of
[08:53:43] <CoderGuy> so I can't cause the css code to be activated some other way?
[08:54:01] <pavonia> Why would you?
[08:57:01] <CoderGuy> why not?
[09:14:39] <fernandobasso> Greetings from brazil. I could not discover, by reading `on` documentation, how to check whether or not there is already a given event bound to an element. Is it possible?
[11:33:03] <jak2000> hi all
[11:33:07] <jak2000> merry Xmas
[12:54:13] <weijunli> http://jsfiddle.net/evnkdr9o/ - help me with this basic js issue please. Currently the len is 0
[13:35:01] <incog88>  Why do i keep getting jQuery not defined when calling from inside a class even though i've included it before calling that class? https://codeshare.io/G6w8Np 
[13:35:12] <incog88> Driving me nuts, I know it works on another project, in that paste line 2 & 3 import it
[13:54:10] <CoderGuy> just wanted to give an update
[13:55:17] <CoderGuy> the solution to my problem was to call .toggleClass('is-active',true); or .toggleClass('is-active',false); on my object...this properly simulates the behavior of an anchor tag being clicked...not to the point where an element would be scrolled into place, but to the visual state of the object
[13:56:01] <CoderGuy> as for the windows location, or browsers url...i'm using history.pushState to change it
[13:56:54] <CoderGuy> but that was the initial problem to begin with, clicking an image having it show up but then having the url not reflect where the image is actually located. So couple tweeks allows fun js stuff & then default behavior without js will just be that the clicked link goes to where the image is located...anyways
[13:57:51] <CoderGuy> also I won't be doing this, but I think this would allow for me to remove the js, but keep the hashtags... in the event a user was not using javascript...but they will be, so doesn't matter
