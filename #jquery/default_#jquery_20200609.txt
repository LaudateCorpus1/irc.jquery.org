[02:14:45] <Cork> robertparkerx: about the String commend from yesterday. You normally don't need to do that in js. Js is week typed so things gets converted to string automatically if add different types
[02:14:54] <Cork> so "a" + 101 == "a101"
[07:03:44] <gnstaxo> how do I happend an element, next to a specific sibling?
[07:03:50] <gnstaxo> append*
[07:05:31] <Cork> .insertAfter() or .after()
[07:27:53] <gnstaxo> thanks
[07:38:52] <robertparkerx> Cork, I did not know that. Thank you!
[07:39:15] <robertparkerx> I was trying to debug a script. It stopped working. There were lots of undefined.
[09:07:05] <v0lksman> hey all!  when I use $('#foo').val('newval') on a textarea that has .change bound, change doesn't fire when updated by .val()
[09:07:59] <v0lksman> should I be using something other than .val() magic?

[09:50:36] <gnstaxo> how do I load a div from an ajax request?
[10:06:00] <Cork> gnstaxo: $('target selector').append(div)
[10:06:28] <Cork> v0lksman: events aren't fired by code changes, they are for user interactions
[10:07:01] <Cork> v0lksman: you can trigger an event mechanically with ex. .trigger('change')
[10:07:37] <Cork> v0lksman: but as it is quite common to modify the value in an input from an event it would cause recursion if it did trigger all the events
